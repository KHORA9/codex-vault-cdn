Even Mildred Mayhew, whom I\r\nhad hitherto regarded as my life's light, became less luminous. I was\r\nnot engaged to Mildred, but I lodged with her mother, and I sang duets\r\nwith Mildred, and gave her gloves when it would run to it, which was\r\nseldom. She was a dear good girl, and I meant to marry her some day. It\r\nis very nice to feel that a good little woman is thinking of you--it\r\nhelps you in your work--and it is pleasant to know she will say \"Yes\"\r\nwhen you say \"Will you?\"\r\n\r\nBut, as I say, my legacy almost put Mildred out of my head, especially\r\nas she was staying with friends in the country just then.\r\n\r\nBefore the first gloss was off my new mourning I was seated in my aunt's\r\nown armchair in front of the fire in the dining-room of my own house. My\r\nown house! It was grand, but rather lonely. I _did_ think of Mildred\r\njust then.\r\n\r\nThe room was comfortably furnished with oak and leather. On the walls\r\nhung a few fairly good oil-paintings, but the space above the\r\nmantelpiece was disfigured by an exceedingly bad print, \"The Trial of\r\nLord William Russell,\" framed in a dark frame. I got up to look at it.\r\nI had visited my aunt with dutiful regularity, but I never remembered\r\nseeing this frame before. It was not intended for a print, but for an\r\noil-painting. It was of fine ebony, beautifully and curiously carved.\r\n\r\nI looked at it with growing interest, and when my aunt's housemaid--I\r\nhad retained her modest staff of servants--came in with the lamp, I\r\nasked her how long the print had been there.\r\n\r\n\"Mistress only bought it two days afore she was took ill,\" she said;\r\n\"but the frame--she didn't want to buy a new one--so she got this out of\r\nthe attic. There's lots of curious old things there, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had my aunt had this frame long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, sir. It come long afore I did, and I've been here seven years\r\ncome Christmas. There was a picture in it--that's upstairs too--but it's\r\nthat black and ugly it might as well be a chimley-back.\"\r\n\r\nI felt a desire to see this picture. What if it were some priceless old\r\nmaster in which my aunt's eyes had only seen rubbish?\r\n\r\nDirectly after breakfast next morning I paid a visit to the lumber-room.\r\n\r\nIt was crammed with old furniture enough to stock a curiosity shop. All\r\nthe house was furnished solidly in the early Victorian style, and in\r\nthis room everything not in keeping with the \"drawing-room suite\" ideal\r\nwas stowed away. Tables of papier-maché and mother-of-pearl,\r\nstraight-backed chairs with twisted feet and faded needlework cushions,\r\nfirescreens of old-world design, oak bureaux with brass handles, a\r\nlittle work-table with its faded moth-eaten silk flutings hanging in\r\ndisconsolate shreds: on these and the dust that covered them blazed the\r\nfull daylight as I drew up the blinds. I promised myself a good time in\r\nre-enshrining these household gods in my parlour, and promoting the\r\nVictorian suite to the attic. But at present my business was to find the\r\npicture as \"black as the chimley-back;\" and presently, behind a heap of\r\nhideous still-life studies, I found it.\r\n\r\nJane the housemaid identified it at once. I took it downstairs carefully\r\nand examined it. No subject, no colour were distinguishable. There was a\r\nsplodge of a darker tint in the middle, but whether it was figure or\r\ntree or house no man could have told. It seemed to be painted on a very\r\nthick panel bound with leather. I decided to send it to one of those\r\npersons who pour on rotting family portraits the water of eternal\r\nyouth--mere soap and water Mr. Besant tells us it is; but even as I did\r\nso the thought occurred to me to try my own restorative hand at a corner\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMy bath-sponge, soap, and nailbrush vigorously applied for a few seconds\r\nshowed me that there was no picture to clean! Bare oak presented itself\r\nto my persevering brush. I tried the other side, Jane watching me with\r\nindulgent interest. The same result. Then the truth dawned on me. Why\r\nwas the panel so thick? I tore off the leather binding, and the panel\r\ndivided and fell to the ground in a cloud of dust. There were two\r\npictures--they had been nailed face to face. I leaned them against the\r\nwall, and the next moment I was leaning against it myself.\r\n\r\nFor one of the pictures was myself--a perfect portrait--no shade of\r\nexpression or turn of feature wanting. Myself--in a cavalier dress,\r\n\"love-locks and all!\" When had this been done? And how, without my\r\nknowledge? Was this some whim of my aunt's?\r\n\r\n\"Lor', sir!\" the shrill surprise of Jane at my elbow; \"what a lovely\r\nphoto it is! Was it a fancy ball, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I stammered. \"I--I don't think I want anything more now. You can\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\nShe went; and I turned, still with my heart beating violently, to the\r\nother picture. This was a woman of the type of beauty beloved of Burne\r\nJones and Rossetti--straight nose, low brows, full lips, thin hands,\r\nlarge deep luminous eyes. She wore a black velvet gown. It was a\r\nfull-length portrait. Her arms rested on a table beside her, and her\r\nhead on her hands; but her face was turned full forward, and her eyes\r\nmet those of the spectator bewilderingly. On the table by her were\r\ncompasses and instruments whose uses I did not know, books, a goblet,\r\nand a miscellaneous heap of papers and pens. I saw all this afterwards.\r\nI believe it was a quarter of an hour before I could turn my eyes away\r\nfrom hers. I have never seen any other eyes like hers. They appealed, as\r\na child's or a dog's do; they commanded, as might those of an empress.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I sweep up the dust, sir?\" Curiosity had brought Jane back. I\r\nacceded. I turned from her my portrait. I kept between her and the woman\r\nin the black velvet. When I was alone again I tore down \"The Trial of\r\nLord William Russell,\" and I put the picture of the woman in its strong\r\nebony frame.\r\n\r\nThen I wrote to a frame-maker for a frame for my portrait. It had so\r\nlong lived face to face with this beautiful witch that I had not the\r\nheart to banish it from her presence; from which, it will be perceived\r\nthat I am by nature a somewhat sentimental person.\r\n\r\nThe new frame came home, and I hung it opposite the fireplace. An\r\nexhaustive search among my aunt's papers showed no explanation of the\r\nportrait of myself, no history of the portrait of the woman with the\r\nwonderful eyes. I only learned that all the old furniture together had\r\ncome to my aunt at the death of my great-uncle, the head of the family;\r\nand I should have concluded that the resemblance was only a family one,\r\nif every one who came in had not exclaimed at the \"speaking likeness.\" I\r\nadopted Jane's \"fancy ball\" explanation.\r\n\r\nAnd there, one might suppose, the matter of the portraits ended. One\r\nmight suppose it, that is, if there were not evidently a good deal more\r\nwritten here about it. However, to me, then, the matter seemed ended.\r\n\r\nI went to see Mildred; I invited her and her mother to come and stay\r\nwith me. I rather avoided glancing at the picture in the ebony frame. I\r\ncould not forget, nor remember without singular emotion, the look in\r\nthe eyes of that woman when mine first met them. I shrank from meeting\r\nthat look again.\r\n\r\nI reorganized the house somewhat, preparing for Mildred's visit. I\r\nturned the dining-room into a drawing-room. I brought down much of the\r\nold-fashioned furniture, and, after a long day of arranging and\r\nre-arranging, I sat down before the fire, and, lying back in a pleasant\r\nlanguor, I idly raised my eyes to the picture. I met her dark, deep\r\nhazel eyes, and once more my gaze was held fixed as by a strong\r\nmagic--the kind of fascination that keeps one sometimes staring for\r\nwhole minutes into one's own eyes in the glass. I gazed into her eyes,\r\nand felt my own dilate, pricked with a smart like the smart of tears.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" I said, \"oh, how I wish you were a woman, and not a picture!\r\nCome down! Ah, come down!\"\r\n\r\nI laughed at myself as I spoke; but even as I laughed I held out my\r\narms.\r\n\r\nI was not sleepy; I was not drunk. I was as wide awake and as sober as\r\never was a man in this world. And yet, as I held out my arms, I saw the\r\neyes of the picture dilate, her lips tremble--if I were to be hanged for\r\nsaying it, it is true. Her hands moved slightly, and a sort of flicker\r\nof a smile passed over her face.\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet. \"This won't do,\" I said, still aloud. \"Firelight\r\ndoes play strange tricks. I'll have the lamp.\"\r\n\r\nI pulled myself together and made for the bell. My hand was on it, when\r\nI heard a sound behind me, and turned--the bell still unrung. The fire\r\nhad burned low, and the corners of the room were deeply shadowed; but,\r\nsurely, there--behind the tall worked chair--was something darker than a\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\n\"I must face this out,\" I said, \"or I shall never be able to face myself\r\nagain.\" I left the bell, I seized the poker, and battered the dull coals\r\nto a blaze. Then I stepped back resolutely, and looked up at the\r\npicture. The ebony frame was empty! From the shadow of the worked chair\r\ncame a silken rustle, and out of the shadow the woman of the picture\r\nwas coming--coming towards me.\r\n\r\nI hope I shall never again know a moment of terror so blank and\r\nabsolute. I could not have moved or spoken to save my life. Either all\r\nthe known laws of nature were nothing, or I was mad. I stood trembling,\r\nbut, I am thankful to remember, I stood still, while the black velvet\r\ngown swept across the hearthrug towards me.\r\n\r\nNext moment a hand touched me--a hand soft, warm, and human--and a low\r\nvoice said, \"You called me. I am here.\"\r\n\r\nAt that touch and that voice the world seemed to give a sort of\r\nbewildering half-turn. I hardly know how to express it, but at once it\r\nseemed not awful--not even unusual--for portraits to become flesh--only\r\nmost natural, most right, most unspeakably fortunate.\r\n\r\nI laid my hand on hers. I looked from her to my portrait. I could not\r\nsee it in the firelight.\r\n\r\n\"We are not strangers,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, not strangers.\" Those luminous eyes were looking up into\r\nmine--those red lips were near me. With a passionate cry--a sense of\r\nhaving suddenly recovered life's one great good, that had seemed wholly\r\nlost--I clasped her in my arms. She was no ghost--she was a woman--the\r\nonly woman in the world.\r\n\r\n\"How long,\" I said, \"O love--how long since I lost you?\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned back, hanging her full weight on the hands that were clasped\r\nbehind my head.\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell how long? There is no time in hell,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nIt was not a dream. Ah, no--there are no such dreams. I wish to God\r\nthere could be. When in dreams do I see her eyes, hear her voice, feel\r\nher lips against my cheek, hold her hands to my lips, as I did that\r\nnight--the supreme night of my life? At first we hardly spoke. It seemed\r\nenough--\r\n\r\n    \"... after long grief and pain,\r\n    To feel the arms of my true love\r\n      Round me once again.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to tell this story. There are no words to express\r\nthe sense of glad reunion, the complete realization of every hope and\r\ndream of a life, that came upon me as I sat with my hand in hers and\r\nlooked into her eyes.\r\n\r\nHow could it have been a dream, when I left her sitting in the\r\nstraight-backed chair, and went down to the kitchen to tell the maids I\r\nshould want nothing more--that I was busy, and did not wish to be\r\ndisturbed; when I fetched wood for the fire with my own hands, and,\r\nbringing it in, found her still sitting there--saw the little brown head\r\nturn as I entered, saw the love in her dear eyes; when I threw myself at\r\nher feet and blessed the day I was born, since life had given me this?\r\n\r\nNot a thought of Mildred: all the other things in my life were a\r\ndream--this, its one splendid reality.\r\n\r\n\"I am wondering,\" she said after a while, when we had made such cheer\r\neach of the other as true lovers may after long parting--\"I am\r\nwondering how much you remember of our past.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember nothing,\" I said. \"Oh, my dear lady, my dear sweetheart--I\r\nremember nothing but that I love you--that I have loved you all my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You remember nothing--really nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that I am yours; that we have both suffered; that----Tell me, my\r\nmistress dear, all that you remember. Explain it all to me. Make me\r\nunderstand. And yet----No, I don't want to understand. It is enough that\r\nwe are together.\"\r\n\r\nIf it was a dream, why have I never dreamed it again?\r\n\r\nShe leaned down towards me, her arm lay on my neck, and drew my head\r\ntill it rested on her shoulder. \"I am a ghost, I suppose,\" she said,\r\nlaughing softly; and her laughter stirred memories which I just grasped\r\nat, and just missed. \"But you and I know better, don't we? I will tell\r\nyou everything you have forgotten. We loved each other--ah! no, you have\r\nnot forgotten that--and when you came back from the war we were to be\r\nmarried. Our pictures were painted before you went away. You know I was\r\nmore learned than women of that day. Dear one, when you were gone they\r\nsaid I was a witch. They tried me. They said I should be burned. Just\r\nbecause I had looked at the stars and had gained more knowledge than\r\nthey, they must needs bind me to a stake and let me be eaten by the\r\nfire. And you far away!\"\r\n\r\nHer whole body trembled and shrank. O love, what dream would have told\r\nme that my kisses would soothe even that memory?\r\n\r\n\"The night before,\" she went on, \"the devil did come to me. I was\r\ninnocent before--you know it, don't you? And even then my sin was for\r\nyou--for you--because of the exceeding love I bore you. The devil came,\r\nand I sold my soul to eternal flame. But I got a good price. I got the\r\nright to come back, through my picture (if any one looking at it wished\r\nfor me), as long as my picture stayed in its ebony frame. That frame\r\nwas not carved by man's hand. I got the right to come back to you. Oh,\r\nmy heart's heart, and another thing I won, which you shall hear anon.\r\nThey burned me for a witch, they made me suffer hell on earth. Those\r\nfaces, all crowding round, the crackling wood and the smell of the\r\nsmoke----\"\r\n\r\n\"O love! no more--no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"When my mother sat that night before my picture she wept, and cried,\r\n'Come back, my poor lost child!' And I went to her, with glad leaps of\r\nheart. Dear, she shrank from me, she fled, she shrieked and moaned of\r\nghosts. She had our pictures covered from sight and put again in the\r\nebony frame. She had promised me my picture should stay always there.\r\nAh, through all these years your face was against mine.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused.\r\n\r\n\"But the man you loved?\"\r\n\r\n\"You came home. My picture was gone. They lied to you, and you married\r\nanother woman; but some day I knew you would walk the world again and\r\nthat I should find you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other gain?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The other gain,\" she said slowly, \"I gave my soul for. It is this. If\r\nyou also will give up your hopes of heaven I can remain a woman, I can\r\nmove in your world--I can be your wife. Oh, my dear, after all these\r\nyears, at last--at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I sacrifice my soul,\" I said slowly, with no thought of the\r\nimbecility of such talk in our \"so-called nineteenth century\"--\"if I\r\nsacrifice my soul, I win you? Why, love, it's a contradiction in terms.\r\nYou _are_ my soul.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes looked straight into mine. Whatever might happen, whatever did\r\nhappen, whatever may happen, our two souls in that moment met, and\r\nbecame one.\r\n\r\n\"Then you choose--you deliberately choose--to give up your hopes of\r\nheaven for me, as I gave up mine for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I decline,\" I said, \"to give up my hope of heaven on any terms. Tell me\r\nwhat I must do, that you and I may make our heaven here--as now, my dear\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you to-morrow,\" she said. \"Be alone here to-morrow\r\nnight--twelve is ghost's time, isn't it?--and then I will come out of\r\nthe picture and never go back to it. I shall live with you, and die, and\r\nbe buried, and there will be an end of me. But we shall live first, my\r\nheart's heart.\"\r\n\r\nI laid my head on her knee. A strange drowsiness overcame me. Holding\r\nher hand against my cheek, I lost consciousness. When I awoke the grey\r\nNovember dawn was glimmering, ghost-like, through the uncurtained\r\nwindow. My head was pillowed on my arm, which rested--I raised my head\r\nquickly--ah! not on my lady's knee, but on the needle-worked cushion of\r\nthe straight-backed chair. I sprang to my feet. I was stiff with cold,\r\nand dazed with dreams, but I turned my eyes on the picture. There she\r\nsat, my lady, my dear love. I held out my arms, but the passionate cry I\r\nwould have uttered died on my lips. She had said twelve o'clock. Her\r\nlightest word was my law. So I only stood in front of the picture and\r\ngazed into those grey-green eyes till tears of passionate happiness\r\nfilled my own.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear, my dear, how shall I pass the hours till I hold you\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\nNo thought, then, of my whole life's completion and consummation being a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nI staggered up to my room, fell across my bed, and slept heavily and\r\ndreamlessly. When I awoke it was high noon. Mildred and her mother were\r\ncoming to lunch.\r\n\r\nI remembered, at one shock, Mildred's coming and her existence.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, the dream began.\r\n\r\nWith a penetrating sense of the futility of any action apart from _her_,\r\nI gave the necessary orders for the reception of my guests. When Mildred\r\nand her mother came I received them with cordiality; but my genial\r\nphrases all seemed to be some one else's. My voice sounded like an echo;\r\nmy heart was other where.\r\n\r\nStill, the situation was not intolerable until the hour when afternoon\r\ntea was served in the drawing-room. Mildred and her mother kept the\r\nconversational pot boiling with a profusion of genteel commonplaces, and\r\nI bore it, as one can bear mild purgatories when one is in sight of\r\nheaven. I looked up at my sweetheart in the ebony frame, and I felt that\r\nanything that might happen, any irresponsible imbecility, any bathos of\r\nboredom, was nothing, if, after it all, _she_ came to me again.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when Mildred, too, looked at the portrait, and said, \"What a\r\nfine lady! One of your flames, Mr. Devigne?\" I had a sickening sense of\r\nimpotent irritation, which became absolute torture when Mildred--how\r\ncould I ever have admired that chocolate-box barmaid style of\r\nprettiness?--threw herself into the high-backed chair, covering the\r\nneedlework with her ridiculous flounces, and added, \"Silence gives\r\nconsent! Who is it, Mr. Devigne? Tell us all about her: I am sure she\r\nhas a story.\"\r\n\r\nPoor little Mildred, sitting there smiling, serene in her confidence\r\nthat her every word charmed me--sitting there with her rather pinched\r\nwaist, her rather tight boots, her rather vulgar voice--sitting in the\r\nchair where my dear lady had sat when she told me her story! I could not\r\nbear it.\r\n\r\n\"Don't sit there,\" I said; \"it's not comfortable!\"\r\n\r\nBut the girl would not be warned. With a laugh that set every nerve in\r\nmy body vibrating with annoyance, she said, \"Oh, dear! mustn't I even\r\nsit in the same chair as your black-velvet woman?\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the chair in the picture. It _was_ the same; and in her\r\nchair Mildred was sitting. Then a horrible sense of the reality of\r\nMildred came upon me. Was all this a reality after all? But for\r\nfortunate chance might Mildred have occupied, not only her chair, but\r\nher place in my life? I rose.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you won't think me very rude,\" I said; \"but I am obliged to go\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nI forget what appointment I alleged. The lie came readily enough.\r\n\r\nI faced Mildred's pouts with the hope that she and her mother would not\r\nwait dinner for me. I fled. In another minute I was safe, alone, under\r\nthe chill, cloudy autumn sky--free to think, think, think of my dear\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nI walked for hours along streets and squares; I lived over again and\r\nagain every look, word, and hand-touch--every kiss; I was completely,\r\nunspeakably happy.\r\n\r\nMildred was utterly forgotten: my lady of the ebony frame filled my\r\nheart and soul and spirit.\r\n\r\nAs I heard eleven boom through the fog, I turned, and went home.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to my street, I found a crowd surging through it, a strong\r\nred light filling the air.\r\n\r\nA house was on fire. Mine.\r\n\r\nI elbowed my way through the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe picture of my lady--that, at least, I could save!\r\n\r\nAs I sprang up the steps, I saw, as in a dream--yes, all this was\r\n_really_ dream-like--I saw Mildred leaning out of the first-floor\r\nwindow, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Come back, sir,\" cried a fireman; \"we'll get the young lady out right\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\nBut _my_ lady? I went on up the stairs, cracking, smoking, and as hot\r\nas hell, to the room where her picture was. Strange to say, I only felt\r\nthat the picture was a thing we should like to look on through the long\r\nglad wedded life that was to be ours. I never thought of it as being one\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nAs I reached the first floor I felt arms round my neck. The smoke was\r\ntoo thick for me to distinguish features.\r\n\r\n\"Save me!\" a voice whispered. I clasped a figure in my arms, and, with a\r\nstrange dis-ease, bore it down the shaking stairs and out into safety.\r\nIt was Mildred. I knew _that_ directly I clasped her.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back,\" cried the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Every one's safe,\" cried a fireman.\r\n\r\nThe flames leaped from every window. The sky grew redder and redder. I\r\nsprang from the hands that would have held me. I leaped up the steps. I\r\ncrawled up the stairs. Suddenly the whole horror of the situation came\r\non me. \"_As long as my picture remains in the ebony frame._\" What if\r\npicture and frame perished together?\r\n\r\nI fought with the fire, and with my own choking inability to fight with\r\nit. I pushed on. I must save my picture. I reached the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nAs I sprang in I saw my lady--I swear it--through the smoke and the\r\nflames, hold out her arms to me--to me--who came too late to save her,\r\nand to save my own life's joy. I never saw her again.\r\n\r\nBefore I could reach her, or cry out to her, I felt the floor yield\r\nbeneath my feet, and I fell into the fiery hell below.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow did they save me? What does that matter? They saved me\r\nsomehow--curse them. Every stick of my aunt's furniture was destroyed.\r\nMy friends pointed out that, as the furniture was heavily insured, the\r\ncarelessness of a nightly-studious housemaid had done me no harm.\r\n\r\nNo harm!\r\n\r\nThat was how I won and lost my only love.\r\n\r\nI deny, with all my soul in the denial, that it was a dream. There are\r\nno such dreams. Dreams of longing and pain there are in plenty, but\r\ndreams of complete, of unspeakable happiness--ah, no--it is the rest of\r\nlife that is the dream.\r\n\r\nBut if I think that, why have I married Mildred, and grown stout and\r\ndull and prosperous?\r\n\r\nI tell you it is all _this_ that is the dream; my dear lady only is the\r\nreality. And what does it matter what one does in a dream?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN CHARRINGTON'S WEDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one ever thought that May Forster would marry John Charrington; but\r\nhe thought differently, and things which John Charrington intended had a\r\nqueer way of coming to pass. He asked her to marry him before he went up\r\nto Oxford. She laughed and refused him. He asked her again next time he\r\ncame home. Again she laughed, tossed her dainty blonde head, and again\r\nrefused. A third time he asked her; she said it was becoming a confirmed\r\nbad habit, and laughed at him more than ever.\r\n\r\nJohn was not the only man who wanted to marry her: she was the belle of\r\nour village _coterie,_ and we were all in love with her more or less;\r\nit was a sort of fashion, like heliotrope ties or Inverness capes.\r\nTherefore we were as much annoyed as surprised when John Charrington\r\nwalked into our little local Club--we held it in a loft over the\r\nsaddler's, I remember--and invited us all to his wedding.\r\n\r\n\"Your wedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's the happy fair? When's it to be?\"\r\n\r\nJohn Charrington filled his pipe and lighted it before he replied. Then\r\nhe said--\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to deprive you fellows of your only joke--but Miss Forster\r\nand I are to be married in September.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's got the mitten again, and it's turned his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, rising, \"I see it's true. Lend me a pistol some one--or a\r\nfirst-class fare to the other end of Nowhere. Charrington has bewitched\r\nthe only pretty girl in our twenty-mile radius. Was it mesmerism, or a\r\nlove-potion, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither, sir, but a gift you'll never have--perseverance--and the best\r\nluck a man ever had in this world.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in his voice that silenced me, and all chaff of the\r\nother fellows failed to draw him further.\r\n\r\nThe queer thing about it was that when we congratulated Miss Forster,\r\nshe blushed and smiled and dimpled, for all the world as though she were\r\nin love with him, and had been in love with him all the time. Upon my\r\nword, I think she had. Women are strange creatures.\r\n\r\nWe were all asked to the wedding. In Brixham every one who was anybody\r\nknew everybody else who was any one. My sisters were, I truly believe,\r\nmore interested in the _trousseau_ than the bride herself, and I was to\r\nbe best man. The coming marriage was much canvassed at afternoon\r\ntea-tables, and at our little Club over the saddler's, and the question\r\nwas always asked: \"Does she care for him?\"\r\n\r\nI used to ask that question myself in the early days of their\r\nengagement, but after a certain evening in August I never asked it\r\nagain. I was coming home from the Club through the churchyard. Our\r\nchurch is on a thyme-grown hill, and the turf about it is so thick and\r\nsoft that one's footsteps are noiseless.\r\n\r\nI made no sound as I vaulted the low lichened wall, and threaded my way\r\nbetween the tombstones. It was at the same instant that I heard John\r\nCharrington's voice, and saw Her. May was sitting on a low flat\r\ngravestone, her face turned towards the full splendour of the western\r\nsun. Its expression ended, at once and for ever, any question of love\r\nfor him; it was transfigured to a beauty I should not have believed\r\npossible, even to that beautiful little face.\r\n\r\nJohn lay at her feet, and it was his voice that broke the stillness of\r\nthe golden August evening.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, my dear, I believe I should come back from the dead if you\r\nwanted me!\"\r\n\r\nI coughed at once to indicate my presence, and passed on into the shadow\r\nfully enlightened.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was to be early in September. Two days before I had to run\r\nup to town on business. The train was late, of course, for we are on the\r\nSouth-Eastern, and as I stood grumbling with my watch in my hand, whom\r\nshould I see but John Charrington and May Forster. They were walking up\r\nand down the unfrequented end of the platform, arm in arm, looking into\r\neach other's eyes, careless of the sympathetic interest of the porters.\r\n\r\nOf course I knew better than to hesitate a moment before burying myself\r\nin the booking-office, and it was not till the train drew up at the\r\nplatform, that I obtrusively passed the pair with my Gladstone, and took\r\nthe corner in a first-class smoking-carriage. I did this with as good an\r\nair of not seeing them as I could assume. I pride myself on my\r\ndiscretion, but if John were travelling alone I wanted his company. I\r\nhad it.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, old man,\" came his cheery voice as he swung his bag into my\r\ncarriage; \"here's luck; I was expecting a dull journey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you off to?\" I asked, discretion still bidding me turn my\r\neyes away, though I saw, without looking, that hers were red-rimmed.\r\n\r\n\"To old Branbridge's,\" he answered, shutting the door and leaning out\r\nfor a last word with his sweetheart.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wish you wouldn't go, John,\" she was saying in a low, earnest\r\nvoice. \"I feel certain something will happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I should let anything happen to keep me, and the day after\r\nto-morrow our wedding-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go,\" she answered, with a pleading intensity which would have\r\nsent my Gladstone on to the platform and me after it. But she wasn't\r\nspeaking to me. John Charrington was made differently; he rarely changed\r\nhis opinions, never his resolutions.\r\n\r\nHe only stroked the little ungloved hands that lay on the carriage\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"I must, May. The old boy's been awfully good to me, and now he's dying\r\nI must go and see him, but I shall come home in time for----\" the rest\r\nof the parting was lost in a whisper and in the rattling lurch of the\r\nstarting train.\r\n\r\n\"You're sure to come?\" she spoke as the train moved.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing shall keep me,\" he answered; and we steamed out. After he had\r\nseen the last of the little figure on the platform he leaned back in his\r\ncorner and kept silence for a minute.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke it was to explain to me that his godfather, whose heir he\r\nwas, lay dying at Peasmarsh Place, some fifty miles away, and had sent\r\nfor John, and John had felt bound to go.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be surely back to-morrow,\" he said, \"or, if not, the day after,\r\nin heaps of time. Thank Heaven, one hasn't to get up in the middle of\r\nthe night to get married nowadays!\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose Mr. Branbridge dies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alive or dead I mean to be married on Thursday!\" John answered,\r\nlighting a cigar and unfolding the _Times_.\r\n\r\nAt Peasmarsh station we said \"good-bye,\" and he got out, and I saw him\r\nride off; I went on to London, where I stayed the night.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home the next afternoon, a very wet one, by the way, my\r\nsister greeted me with--\r\n\r\n\"Where's Mr. Charrington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness knows,\" I answered testily. Every man, since Cain, has\r\nresented that kind of question.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you might have heard from him,\" she went on, \"as you're to\r\ngive him away to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't he back?\" I asked, for I had confidently expected to find him at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\"No, Geoffrey,\"--my sister Fanny always had a way of jumping to\r\nconclusions, especially such conclusions as were least favourable to her\r\nfellow-creatures--\"he has not returned, and, what is more, you may\r\ndepend upon it he won't. You mark my words, there'll be no wedding\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nMy sister Fanny has a power of annoying me which no other human being\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\n\"You mark my words,\" I retorted with asperity, \"you had better give up\r\nmaking such a thundering idiot of yourself. There'll be more wedding\r\nto-morrow than ever you'll take the first part in.\" A prophecy which, by\r\nthe way, came true.\r\n\r\nBut though I could snarl confidently to my sister, I did not feel so\r\ncomfortable when, late that night, I, standing on the doorstep of John's\r\nhouse, heard that he had not returned. I went home gloomily through the\r\nrain. Next morning brought a brilliant blue sky, gold sun, and all such\r\nsoftness of air and beauty of cloud as go to make up a perfect day. I\r\nwoke with a vague feeling of having gone to bed anxious, and of being\r\nrather averse to facing that anxiety in the light of full wakefulness.\r\n\r\nBut with my shaving-water came a note from John which relieved my mind\r\nand sent me up to the Forsters' with a light heart.\r\n\r\nMay was in the garden. I saw her blue gown through the hollyhocks as the\r\nlodge gates swung to behind me. So I did not go up to the house, but\r\nturned aside down the turfed path.\r\n\r\n\"He's written to you too,\" she said, without preliminary greeting, when\r\nI reached her side.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm to meet him at the station at three, and come straight on to\r\nthe church.\"\r\n\r\nHer face looked pale, but there was a brightness in her eyes, and a\r\ntender quiver about the mouth that spoke of renewed happiness.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Branbridge begged him so to stay another night that he had not the\r\nheart to refuse,\" she went on. \"He is so kind, but I wish he hadn't\r\nstayed.\"\r\n\r\nI was at the station at half-past two. I felt rather annoyed with John.\r\nIt seemed a sort of slight to the beautiful girl who loved him, that he\r\nshould come as it were out of breath, and with the dust of travel upon\r\nhim, to take her hand, which some of us would have given the best years\r\nof our lives to take.\r\n\r\nBut when the three o'clock train glided in, and glided out again having\r\nbrought no passengers to our little station, I was more than annoyed.\r\nThere was no other train for thirty-five minutes; I calculated that,\r\nwith much hurry, we might just get to the church in time for the\r\nceremony; but, oh, what a fool to miss that first train! What other man\r\ncould have done it?\r\n\r\nThat thirty-five minutes seemed a year, as I wandered round the station\r\nreading the advertisements and the time-tables, and the company's\r\nbye-laws, and getting more and more angry with John Charrington. This\r\nconfidence in his own power of getting everything he wanted the minute\r\nhe wanted it was leading him too far. I hate waiting. Every one does,\r\nbut I believe I hate it more than any one else. The three thirty-five\r\nwas late, of course.\r\n\r\nI ground my pipe between my teeth and stamped with impatience as I\r\nwatched the signals. Click. The signal went down. Five minutes later I\r\nflung myself into the carriage that I had brought for John.\r\n\r\n\"Drive to the church!\" I said, as some one shut the door. \"Mr.\r\nCharrington hasn't come by this train.\"\r\n\r\nAnxiety now replaced anger. What had become of the man? Could he have\r\nbeen taken suddenly ill? I had never known him have a day's illness in\r\nhis life. And even so he might have telegraphed. Some awful accident\r\nmust have happened to him. The thought that he had played her false\r\nnever--no, not for a moment--entered my head. Yes, something terrible\r\nhad happened to him, and on me lay the task of telling his bride. I\r\nalmost wished the carriage would upset and break my head so that some\r\none else might tell her, not I, who--but that's nothing to do with his\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nIt was five minutes to four as we drew up at the churchyard gate. A\r\ndouble row of eager on-lookers lined the path from lychgate to porch. I\r\nsprang from the carriage and passed up between them. Our gardener had a\r\ngood front place near the door. I stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Are they waiting still, Byles?\" I asked, simply to gain time, for of\r\ncourse I knew they were by the waiting crowd's attentive attitude.\r\n\r\n\"Waiting, sir? No, no, sir; why, it must be over by now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over! Then Mr. Charrington's come?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the minute, sir; must have missed you somehow, and, I say, sir,\"\r\nlowering his voice, \"I never see Mr. John the least bit so afore, but my\r\nopinion is he's been drinking pretty free. His clothes was all dusty and\r\nhis face like a sheet. I tell you I didn't like the looks of him at all,\r\nand the folks inside are saying all sorts of things. You'll see,\r\nsomething's gone very wrong with Mr. John, and he's tried liquor. He\r\nlooked like a ghost, and in he went with his eyes straight before him,\r\nwith never a look or a word for none of us; him that was always such a\r\ngentleman!\"\r\n\r\nI had never heard Byles make so long a speech. The crowd in the\r\nchurchyard were talking in whispers and getting ready rice and slippers\r\nto throw at the bride and bridegroom. The ringers were ready with their\r\nhands on the ropes to ring out the merry peal as the bride and\r\nbridegroom should come out.\r\n\r\nA murmur from the church announced them; out they came. Byles was right.\r\nJohn Charrington did not look himself. There was dust on his coat, his\r\nhair was disarranged. He seemed to have been in some row, for there was\r\na black mark above his eyebrow. He was deathly pale. But his pallor was\r\nnot greater than that of the bride, who might have been carved in\r\nivory--dress, veil, orange blossoms, face and all.\r\n\r\nAs they passed out the ringers stooped--there were six of them--and\r\nthen, on the ears expecting the gay wedding peal, came the slow tolling\r\nof the passing bell.\r\n\r\nA thrill of horror at so foolish a jest from the ringers passed through\r\nus all. But the ringers themselves dropped the ropes and fled like\r\nrabbits out into the sunlight. The bride shuddered, and grey shadows\r\ncame about her mouth, but the bridegroom led her on down the path where\r\nthe people stood with the handfuls of rice; but the handfuls were never\r\nthrown, and the wedding-bells never rang. In vain the ringers were urged\r\nto remedy their mistake: they protested with many whispered expletives\r\nthat they would see themselves further first.\r\n\r\nIn a hush like the hush in the chamber of death the bridal pair passed\r\ninto their carriage and its door slammed behind them.\r\n\r\nThen the tongues were loosed. A babel of anger, wonder, conjecture from\r\nthe guests and the spectators.\r\n\r\n\"If I'd seen his condition, sir,\" said old Forster to me as we drove\r\noff, \"I would have stretched him on the floor of the church, sir, by\r\nHeaven I would, before I'd have let him marry my daughter!\"\r\n\r\nThen he put his head out of the window.\r\n\r\n\"Drive like hell,\" he cried to the coachman; \"don't spare the horses.\"\r\n\r\nHe was obeyed. We passed the bride's carriage. I forebore to look at it,\r\nand old Forster turned his head away and swore. We reached home before\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe stood in the hall doorway, in the blazing afternoon sun, and in about\r\nhalf a minute we heard wheels crunching the gravel. When the carriage\r\nstopped in front of the steps old Forster and I ran down.\r\n\r\n\"Great Heaven, the carriage is empty! And yet----\"\r\n\r\nI had the door open in a minute, and this is what I saw--\r\n\r\nNo sign of John Charrington; and of May, his wife, only a huddled heap\r\nof white satin lying half on the floor of the carriage and half on the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n\"I drove straight here, sir,\" said the coachman, as the bride's father\r\nlifted her out; \"and I'll swear no one got out of the carriage.\"\r\n\r\nWe carried her into the house in her bridal dress and drew back her\r\nveil. I saw her face. Shall I ever forget it? White, white and drawn\r\nwith agony and horror, bearing such a look of terror as I have never\r\nseen since except in dreams. And her hair, her radiant blonde hair, I\r\ntell you it was white like snow.\r\n\r\nAs we stood, her father and I, half mad with the horror and mystery of\r\nit, a boy came up the avenue--a telegraph boy. They brought the orange\r\nenvelope to me. I tore it open.\r\n\r\n\"_Mr. Charrington was thrown from the dogcart on his way to the station\r\nat half-past one. Killed on the spot!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was married to May Forster in our parish church at _half-past\r\nthree_, in presence of half the parish.\r\n\r\n\"_I shall be married, dead or alive!_\"\r\n\r\nWhat had passed in that carriage on the homeward drive? No one knows--no\r\none will ever know. Oh, May! oh, my dear!\r\n\r\nBefore a week was over they laid her beside her husband in our little\r\nchurchyard on the thyme-covered hill--the churchyard where they had kept\r\ntheir love-trysts.\r\n\r\nThus was accomplished John Charrington's wedding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_UNCLE ABRAHAM'S ROMANCE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear,\" my Uncle Abraham answered me, \"no--nothing romantic ever\r\nhappened to me--unless--but no: that wasn't romantic either----\"\r\n\r\nI was. To me, I being eighteen, romance was the world. My Uncle Abraham\r\nwas old and lame. I followed the gaze of his faded eyes, and my own\r\nrested on a miniature that hung at his elbow-chair's right hand, a\r\nportrait of a woman, whose loveliness even the miniature-painter's art\r\nhad been powerless to disguise--a woman with large lustrous eyes and\r\nperfect oval face.\r\n\r\nI rose to look at it. I had looked at it a hundred times. Often enough\r\nin my baby days I had asked, \"Who's that, uncle?\" always receiving the\r\nsame answer: \"A lady who died long ago, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nAs I looked again at the picture, I asked, \"Was she like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your--your romance!\"\r\n\r\nUncle Abraham looked hard at me. \"Yes,\" he said at last. \"Very--very\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\nI sat down on the floor by him. \"Won't you tell me about her?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing to tell,\" he said. \"I think it was fancy, mostly, and\r\nfolly; but it's the realest thing in my long life, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nA long pause. I kept silence. \"Hurry no man's cattle\" is a good motto,\r\nespecially with old people.\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" he said in the dreamy tone always promising so well to the\r\near that a story delighteth--\"I remember, when I was a young man, I was\r\nvery lonely indeed. I never had a sweetheart. I was always lame, my\r\ndear, from quite a boy; and the girls used to laugh at me.\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed. Presently he went on--\r\n\r\n\"And so I got into the way of mooning off by myself in lonely places,\r\nand one of my favourite walks was up through our churchyard, which was\r\nset high on a hill in the middle of the marsh country. I liked that\r\nbecause I never met any one there. It's all over, years ago. I was a\r\nsilly lad; but I couldn't bear of a summer evening to hear a rustle and\r\na whisper from the other side of the hedge, or maybe a kiss as I went\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I used to go and sit all by myself in the churchyard, which was\r\nalways sweet with thyme, and quite light (on account of its being so\r\nhigh) long after the marshes were dark. I used to watch the bats\r\nflitting about in the red light, and wonder why God didn't make every\r\none's legs straight and strong, and wicked follies like that. But by the\r\ntime the light was gone I had always worked it off, so to speak, and\r\ncould go home quietly and say my prayers without any bitterness.\r\n\r\n\"Well, one hot night in August, when I had watched the sunset fade and\r\nthe crescent moon grow golden, I was just stepping over the low stone\r\nwall of the churchyard when I heard a rustle behind me. I turned round,\r\nexpecting it to be a rabbit or a bird. It was a woman.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the portrait. So did I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"that was her very face. I was a bit scared and said\r\nsomething--I don't know what--and she laughed and said, 'Did I think she\r\nwas a ghost?' and I answered back, and I stayed talking to her over the\r\nchurchyard wall till 'twas quite dark, and the glowworms were out in the\r\nwet grass all along the way home.\r\n\r\n\"Next night I saw her again; and the next night and the next. Always at\r\ntwilight time; and if I passed any lovers leaning on the stiles in the\r\nmarshes it was nothing to me now.\"\r\n\r\nAgain my uncle paused. \"It's very long ago,\" he said slowly, \"and I'm an\r\nold man; but I know what youth means, and happiness, though I was\r\nalways lame, and the girls used to laugh at me. I don't know how long it\r\nwent on--you don't measure time in dreams--but at last your grandfather\r\nsaid I looked as if I had one foot in the grave, and he would be sending\r\nme to stay with our kin at Bath and take the waters. I had to go. I\r\ncould not tell my father why I would rather had died than go.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was her name, uncle?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"She never would tell me her name, and why should she? I had names\r\nenough in my heart to call her by. Marriage? My dear, even then I knew\r\nmarriage was not for me. But I met her night after night, always in our\r\nchurchyard where the yew-trees were and the lichened gravestones. It was\r\nthere we always met and always parted. The last time was the night\r\nbefore I went away. She was very sad, and dearer than life itself. And\r\nshe said--\r\n\r\n\"'If you come back before the new moon I shall meet you here just as\r\nusual. But if the new moon shines on this grave and you are not\r\nhere--you will never see me again any more.'\r\n\r\n\"She laid her hand on the yellow lichened tomb against which we had been\r\nleaning. It was an old weather-worn stone, and bore on it the\r\ninscription--\r\n\r\n    'SUSANNAH KINGSNORTH,\r\n        _Ob._ 1713.'\r\n\r\n\"'I shall be here.' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'I mean it,' she said, with deep and sudden seriousness, 'it is no\r\nfancy. You will be here when the new moon shines?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised, and after a while we parted.\r\n\r\n\"I had been with my kinsfolk at Bath nearly a month. I was to go home on\r\nthe next day, when, turning over a case in the parlour, I came upon that\r\nminiature. I could not speak for a minute. At last I said, with dry\r\ntongue, and heart beating to the tune of heaven and hell--\r\n\r\n\"'Who is this?'\r\n\r\n\"'That?' said my aunt. 'Oh! she was betrothed to one of our family many\r\nyears ago, but she died before the wedding. They say she was a bit of a\r\nwitch. A handsome one, wasn't she?'\r\n\r\n\"I looked again at the face, the lips, the eyes of my dear and lovely\r\nlove, whom I was to meet to-morrow night when the new moon shone on that\r\ntomb in our churchyard.\r\n\r\n\"'Did you say she was dead?' I asked, and I hardly knew my own voice.\r\n\r\n\"'Years and years ago! Her name's on the back and her date----'\r\n\r\n\"I took the portrait from its faded red-velvet bed, and read on the\r\nback--'SUSANNAH KINGSNORTH, _Ob._ 1713.'\r\n\r\n\"That was in 1813.\" My uncle stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I had a fit,\" my uncle answered slowly; \"at any rate, I was\r\nvery ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you missed the new moon on the grave?\"\r\n\r\n\"I missed the new moon on the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you never saw her again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never saw her again----\"\r\n\r\n\"But, uncle, do you really believe?--Can the dead?--was she--did\r\nyou----\"\r\n\r\nMy uncle took out his pipe and filled it.\r\n\r\n\"It's a long time ago,\" he said, \"a many, many years. Old man's tales,\r\nmy dear! Old man's tales! Don't you take any notice of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe lighted the pipe, puffed silently a moment or two, and then added:\r\n\"But I know what youth means, and happiness, though I was lame, and the\r\ngirls used to laugh at me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE MYSTERY OF THE SEMI-DETACHED._\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was waiting for her; he had been waiting an hour and a half in a\r\ndusty suburban lane, with a row of big elms on one side and some\r\neligible building sites on the other--and far away to the south-west the\r\ntwinkling yellow lights of the Crystal Palace. It was not quite like a\r\ncountry lane, for it had a pavement and lamp-posts, but it was not a bad\r\nplace for a meeting all the same; and farther up, towards the cemetery,\r\nit was really quite rural, and almost pretty, especially in twilight.\r\nBut twilight had long deepened into night, and still he waited. He loved\r\nher, and he was engaged to be married to her, with the complete\r\ndisapproval of every reasonable person who had been consulted. And this\r\nhalf-clandestine meeting was to-night to take the place of the\r\ngrudgingly sanctioned weekly interview--because a certain rich uncle was\r\nvisiting at her house, and her mother was not the woman to acknowledge\r\nto a moneyed uncle, who might \"go off\" any day, a match so deeply\r\nineligible as hers with him.\r\n\r\nSo he waited for her, and the chill of an unusually severe May evening\r\nentered into his bones.\r\n\r\nThe policeman passed him with but a surly response to his \"Good night.\"\r\nThe bicyclists went by him like grey ghosts with fog-horns; and it was\r\nnearly ten o'clock, and she had not come.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders and turned towards his lodgings. His road led\r\nhim by her house--desirable, commodious, semi-detached--and he walked\r\nslowly as he neared it. She might, even now, be coming out. But she was\r\nnot. There was no sign of movement about the house, no sign of life, no\r\nlights even in the windows. And her people were not early people.\r\n\r\nHe paused by the gate, wondering.\r\n\r\nThen he noticed that the front door was open--wide open--and the street\r\nlamp shone a little way into the dark hall. There was something about\r\nall this that did not please him--that scared him a little, indeed. The\r\nhouse had a gloomy and deserted air. It was obviously impossible that it\r\nharboured a rich uncle. The old man must have left early. In which\r\ncase----\r\n\r\nHe walked up the path of patent-glazed tiles, and listened. No sign of\r\nlife. He passed into the hall. There was no light anywhere. Where was\r\neverybody, and why was the front door open? There was no one in the\r\ndrawing-room, the dining-room and the study (nine feet by seven) were\r\nequally blank. Every one was out, evidently. But the unpleasant sense\r\nthat he was, perhaps, not the first casual visitor to walk through that\r\nopen door impelled him to look through the house before he went away\r\nand closed it after him. So he went upstairs, and at the door of the\r\nfirst bedroom he came to he struck a wax match, as he had done in the\r\nsitting-rooms. Even as he did so he felt that he was not alone. And he\r\nwas prepared to see _something_; but for what he saw he was not\r\nprepared. For what he saw lay on the bed, in a white loose gown--and it\r\nwas his sweetheart, and its throat was cut from ear to ear. He doesn't\r\nknow what happened then, nor how he got downstairs and into the street;\r\nbut he got out somehow, and the policeman found him in a fit, under the\r\nlamp-post at the corner of the street. He couldn't speak when they\r\npicked him up, and he passed the night in the police-cells, because the\r\npoliceman had seen plenty of drunken men before, but never one in a fit.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he was better, though still very white and shaky. But\r\nthe tale he told the magistrate was convincing, and they sent a couple\r\nof constables with him to her house.\r\n\r\nThere was no crowd about it as he had fancied there would be, and the\r\nblinds were not down.\r\n\r\nAs he stood, dazed, in front of the door, it opened, and she came out.\r\n\r\nHe held on to the door-post for support.\r\n\r\n\"_She's_ all right, you see,\" said the constable, who had found him\r\nunder the lamp. \"I told you you was drunk, but you _would_ know\r\nbest----\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was alone with her he told her--not all--for that would not bear\r\ntelling--but how he had come into the commodious semi-detached, and how\r\nhe had found the door open and the lights out, and that he had been into\r\nthat long back room facing the stairs, and had seen something--in even\r\ntrying to hint at which he turned sick and broke down and had to have\r\nbrandy given him.\r\n\r\n\"But, my dearest,\" she said, \"I dare say the house was dark, for we were\r\nall at the Crystal Palace with my uncle, and no doubt the door was open,\r\nfor the maids _will_ run out if they're left. But you could not have\r\nbeen in that room, because I locked it when I came away, and the key was\r\nin my pocket. I dressed in a hurry and I left all my odds and ends lying\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he said; \"I saw a green scarf on a chair, and some long brown\r\ngloves, and a lot of hairpins and ribbons, and a prayer-book, and a lace\r\nhandkerchief on the dressing-table. Why, I even noticed the almanack on\r\nthe mantelpiece--October 21. At least it couldn't be that, because this\r\nis May. And yet it was. Your almanac is at October 21, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course it isn't,\" she said, smiling rather anxiously; \"but all\r\nthe other things were just as you say. You must have had a dream, or a\r\nvision, or something.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a very ordinary, commonplace, City young man, and he didn't\r\nbelieve in visions, but he never rested day or night till he got his\r\nsweetheart and her mother away from that commodious semi-detached, and\r\nsettled them in a quite distant suburb. In the course of the removal he\r\nincidentally married her, and the mother went on living with them.\r\n\r\nHis nerves must have been a good bit shaken, because he was very queer\r\nfor a long time, and was always inquiring if any one had taken the\r\ndesirable semi-detached; and when an old stockbroker with a family took\r\nit, he went the length of calling on the old gentleman and imploring him\r\nby all that he held dear, not to live in that fatal house.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said the stockbroker, not unnaturally.\r\n\r\nAnd then he got so vague and confused, between trying to tell why and\r\ntrying not to tell why, that the stockbroker showed him out, and thanked\r\nhis God he was not such a fool as to allow a lunatic to stand in the way\r\nof his taking that really remarkably cheap and desirable semi-detached\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nNow the curious and quite inexplicable part of this story is that when\r\nshe came down to breakfast on the morning of the 22nd of October she\r\nfound him looking like death, with the morning paper in his hand. He\r\ncaught hers--he couldn't speak, and pointed to the paper. And there she\r\nread that on the night of the 21st a young lady, the stockbroker's\r\ndaughter, had been found, with her throat cut from ear to ear, on the\r\nbed in the long back bedroom facing the stairs of that desirable\r\nsemi-detached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE DEAD._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\"But true or not true, your brother is a scoundrel. No man--no decent\r\nman--tells such things.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not tell me. How dare you suppose it? I found the letter in his\r\ndesk; and she being my friend and you being her lover, I never thought\r\nthere could be any harm in my reading her letter to my brother. Give me\r\nback the letter. I was a fool to tell you.\"\r\n\r\nIda Helmont held out her hand for the letter.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" I said, and I went to the window. The dull red of a London\r\nsunset burned on the paper, as I read in the quaint, dainty handwriting\r\nI knew so well and had kissed so often--\r\n\r\n    \"Dear, I do--I do love you; but it's impossible. I must marry\r\n    Arthur. My honour is engaged. If he would only set me free--but he\r\n    never will. He loves me so foolishly. But as for me, it is you I\r\n    love--body, soul, and spirit. There is no one in my heart but you. I\r\n    think of you all day, and dream of you all night. And we must part.\r\n    And that is the way of the world. Good-bye!--Yours, yours, yours,\r\n\r\n    ELVIRE.\"\r\n\r\nI had seen the handwriting, indeed, often enough. But the passion\r\nwritten there was new to me. That I had not seen.\r\n\r\nI turned from the window wearily. My sitting-room looked strange to me.\r\nThere were my books, my reading-lamp, my untasted dinner still on the\r\ntable, as I had left it when I rose to dissemble my surprise at Ida\r\nHelmont's visit--Ida Helmont, who now sat in my easy-chair looking at me\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\"Well--do you give me no thanks?\"\r\n\r\n\"You put a knife in my heart, and then ask for thanks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" she said, throwing up her chin. \"I have done nothing but\r\nshow you the truth. For that one should expect no gratitude--may I ask,\r\nout of mere curiosity, what you intend to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your brother will tell you----\"\r\n\r\nShe rose suddenly, pale to the lips.\r\n\r\n\"You will not tell my brother?\" she began.\r\n\r\n\"That you have read his private letters? Certainly not!\"\r\n\r\nShe came towards me--her gold hair flaming in the sunset light.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so angry with me?\" she said. \"Be reasonable. What else\r\ncould I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it have been right not to tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I only know that you've put the sun out, and I haven't\r\ngot used to the dark yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Believe me,\" she said, coming still nearer to me, and laying her hands\r\nin the lightest light touch on my shoulders, \"believe me, she never\r\nloved you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a softness in her tone that irritated and stimulated me. I\r\nmoved gently back, and her hands fell by her sides.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I said. \"I have behaved very badly. You were quite\r\nright to come, and I am not ungrateful. Will you post a letter for me?\"\r\n\r\nI sat down and wrote--\r\n\r\n     \"I give you back your freedom. The only gift of mine that can\r\n     please you now.\r\n\r\n     \"ARTHUR.\"\r\n\r\nI held the sheet out to Miss Helmont, and, when she had glanced at it, I\r\nsealed, stamped, and addressed it.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" I said then, and gave her the letter. As the door closed\r\nbehind her I sank into my chair, and I am not ashamed to say that I\r\ncried like a child or a fool over my lost plaything--the little\r\ndark-haired woman who loved some one else with \"body, soul, and\r\nspirit.\"\r\n\r\nI did not hear the door open or any foot on the floor, and therefore I\r\nstarted when a voice behind me said--\r\n\r\n\"Are you so very unhappy? Oh, Arthur, don't think I am not sorry for\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want any one to be sorry for me, Miss Helmont,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe was silent a moment. Then, with a quick, sudden, gentle movement she\r\nleaned down and kissed my forehead--and I heard the door softly close.\r\nThen I knew that the beautiful Miss Helmont loved me.\r\n\r\nAt first that thought only fleeted by--a light cloud against a grey\r\nsky--but the next day reason woke, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Was Miss Helmont speaking the truth? Was it possible that----?\"\r\n\r\nI determined to see Elvire, to know from her own lips whether by happy\r\nfortune this blow came, not from her, but from a woman in whom love\r\nmight have killed honesty.\r\n\r\nI walked from Hampstead to Gower Street. As I trod its long length, I\r\nsaw a figure in pink come out of one of the houses. It was Elvire. She\r\nwalked in front of me to the corner of Store Street. There she met Oscar\r\nHelmont. They turned and met me face to face, and I saw all I needed to\r\nsee. They loved each other. Ida Helmont had spoken the truth. I bowed\r\nand passed on. Before six months were gone they were married, and before\r\na year was over I had married Ida Helmont.\r\n\r\nWhat did it I don't know. Whether it was remorse for having, even for\r\nhalf a day, dreamed that she could be so base as to forge a lie to gain\r\na lover, or whether it was her beauty, or the sweet flattery of the\r\npreference of a woman who had half her acquaintances at her feet, I\r\ndon't know; anyhow, my thoughts turned to her as to their natural home.\r\nMy heart, too, took that road, and before very long I loved her as I had\r\nnever loved Elvire. Let no one doubt that I loved her--as I shall never\r\nlove again, please God!\r\n\r\nThere never was any one like her. She was brave and beautiful, witty and\r\nwise, and beyond all measure adorable. She was the only woman in the\r\nworld. There was a frankness--a largeness of heart--about her that made\r\nall other women seem small and contemptible. She loved me and I\r\nworshipped her. I married her, I stayed with her for three golden weeks,\r\nand then I left her. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause she told me the truth. It was one night--late--we had sat all\r\nthe evening in the verandah of our seaside lodging watching the\r\nmoonlight on the water and listening to the soft sound of the sea on the\r\nsand. I have never been so happy; I never shall be happy any more, I\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\"Heart's heart,\" she said, leaning her gold head against my shoulder,\r\n\"how much do you love me?\"\r\n\r\n\"How much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--how much? I want to know what place it is I hold in your heart. Am\r\nI more to you than any one else?\"\r\n\r\n\"My love!\"\r\n\r\n\"More than yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you,\" she said. Then she drew a long breath, and took my\r\nhands in hers. \"It can make no difference. Nothing in heaven or earth\r\ncan come between us now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"But, sweet, my wife, what is it?\"\r\n\r\nFor she was deathly pale.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you,\" she said; \"I cannot hide anything now from you,\r\nbecause I am yours--body, soul, and spirit.\"\r\n\r\nThe phrase was an echo that stung me.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight shone on her gold hair, her warm, soft, gold hair, and on\r\nher pale face.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur,\" she said, \"you remember my coming to you at Hampstead with\r\nthat letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my sweet, and I remember how you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Arthur!\"--she spoke fast and low--\"Arthur, that letter was a forgery.\r\nShe never wrote it. I----\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, for I had risen and flung her hands from me, and stood\r\nlooking at her. God help me! I thought it was anger at the lie I felt. I\r\nknow now it was only wounded vanity that smarted in me. That _I_ should\r\nhave been tricked, that _I_ should have been deceived, that _I_ should\r\nhave been led on to make a fool of myself! That _I_ should have married\r\nthe woman who had befooled me! At that moment she was no longer the wife\r\nI adored--she was only a woman who had forged a letter and tricked me\r\ninto marrying her.\r\n\r\nI spoke; I denounced her; I said I would never speak to her again. I\r\nfelt it was rather creditable in me to be so angry. I said I would have\r\nno more to do with a liar and forger.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether I expected her to creep to my knees and implore\r\nforgiveness. I think I had some vague idea that I could by-and-by\r\nconsent with dignity to forgive and forget. I did not mean what I said.\r\nNo, no; I did not mean a word of it. While I was saying it I was longing\r\nfor her to weep and fall at my feet, that I might raise her and hold her\r\nin my arms again.\r\n\r\nBut she did not fall at my feet; she stood quietly looking at me.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur,\" she said, as I paused for breath, \"let me explain--she--I----\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to explain,\" I said hotly, still with that foolish\r\nsense of there being something rather noble in my indignation, as one\r\nfeels when one calls one's self a miserable sinner. \"You are a liar and\r\nforger, and that is enough for me. I will never speak to you again. You\r\nhave wrecked my life----\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that?\" she said, interrupting me, and leaning forward to\r\nlook at me. Tears lay on her cheeks, but she was not crying now.\r\n\r\nI hesitated. I longed to take her in my arms and say--\"Lay your head\r\nhere, my darling, and cry here, and know how I love you.\"\r\n\r\nBut instead I kept silence.\r\n\r\n\"_Do_ you mean it?\" she persisted.\r\n\r\nThen she put her hand on my arm. I longed to clasp it and draw her to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nInstead, I shook it off, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Mean it? Yes--of course I mean it. Don't touch me, please! You have\r\nruined my life.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned away without a word, went into our room, and shut the door.\r\n\r\nI longed to follow her, to tell her that if there was anything to\r\nforgive I forgave it.\r\n\r\nInstead, I went out on the beach, and walked away under the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight and the solitude, however, presently brought me to a\r\nbetter mind. Whatever she had done had been done for love of me--I knew\r\nthat. I would go home and tell her so--tell her that whatever she had\r\ndone she was my dearest life, my heart's one treasure. True, my ideal of\r\nher was shattered, but, even as she was, what was the whole world of\r\nwomen compared to her? I hurried back, but in my resentment and evil\r\ntemper I had walked far, and the way back was very long. I had been\r\nparted from her for three hours by the time I opened the door of the\r\nlittle house where we lodged. The house was dark and very still. I\r\nslipped off my shoes and crept up the narrow stairs, and opened the door\r\nof our room quite softly. Perhaps she would have cried herself to sleep,\r\nand I would lean over her and waken her with my kisses and beg her to\r\nforgive me. Yes, it had come to that now.\r\n\r\nI went into the room--I went towards the bed. She was not there. She was\r\nnot in the room, as one glance showed me. She was not in the house, as I\r\nknew in two minutes. When I had wasted a priceless hour in searching the\r\ntown for her, I found a note on the dressing-table--\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye! Make the best of what is left of your life. I will spoil it\r\nno more.\"\r\n\r\nShe was gone, utterly gone. I rushed to town by the earliest morning\r\ntrain, only to find that her people knew nothing of her. Advertisement\r\nfailed. Only a tramp said he had met a white lady on the cliff, and a\r\nfisherman brought me a handkerchief marked with her name that he had\r\nfound on the beach.\r\n\r\nI searched the country far and wide, but I had to go back to London at\r\nlast, and the months went by. I won't say much about those months,\r\nbecause even the memory of that suffering turns me faint and sick at\r\nheart. The police and detectives and the Press failed me utterly. Her\r\nfriends could not help me, and were, moreover, wildly indignant with me,\r\nespecially her brother, now living very happily with my first love.\r\n\r\nI don't know how I got through those long weeks and months. I tried to\r\nwrite; I tried to read; I tried to live the life of a reasonable human\r\nbeing. But it was impossible. I could not endure the companionship of my\r\nkind. Day and night I almost saw her face--almost heard her voice. I\r\ntook long walks in the country, and her figure was always just round\r\nthe next turn of the road--in the next glade of the wood. But I never\r\nquite saw her--never quite heard her. I believe I was not altogether\r\nsane at that time. At last, one morning as I was setting out for one of\r\nthose long walks that had no goal but weariness, I met a telegraph boy,\r\nand took the red envelope from his hand.\r\n\r\nOn the pink paper inside was written--\r\n\r\n     \"Come to me at once. I am dying. You must come.--IDA.--Apinshaw\r\n     Farm, Mellor, Derbyshire.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a train at twelve to Marple, the nearest station. I took it. I\r\ntell you there are some things that cannot be written about. My life for\r\nthose long months was one of them, that journey was another. What had\r\nher life been for those months? That question troubled me, as one is\r\ntroubled in every nerve at the sight of a surgical operation or a wound\r\ninflicted on a being dear to one. But the overmastering sensation was\r\njoy--intense, unspeakable joy. She was alive! I should see her again. I\r\ntook out the telegram and looked at it: \"I am dying.\" I simply did not\r\nbelieve it. She could not die till she had seen me. And if she had lived\r\nall those months without me, she could live now, when I was with her\r\nagain, when she knew of the hell I had endured apart from her, and the\r\nheaven of our meeting. She must live. I would not let her die.\r\n\r\nThere was a long drive over bleak hills. Dark, jolting, infinitely\r\nwearisome. At last we stopped before a long, low building, where one or\r\ntwo lights gleamed faintly. I sprang out.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. A blaze of light made me blink and draw back. A woman\r\nwas standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Art thee Arthur Marsh?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, th'art ower late. She's dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nI went into the house, walked to the fire, and held out my hands to it\r\nmechanically, for, though the night was May, I was cold to the bone.\r\nThere were some folks standing round the fire and lights flickering.\r\nThen an old woman came forward with the northern instinct of\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\n\"Thou'rt tired,\" she said, \"and mazed-like. Have a sup o' tea.\"\r\n\r\nI burst out laughing. It was too funny. I had travelled two hundred\r\nmiles to see _her_; and she was dead, and they offered me tea. They drew\r\nback from me as if I had been a wild beast, but I could not stop\r\nlaughing. Then a hand was laid on my shoulder, and some one led me into\r\na dark room, lighted a lamp, set me in a chair, and sat down opposite\r\nme. It was a bare parlour, coldly furnished with rush chairs and\r\nmuch-polished tables and presses. I caught my breath, and grew suddenly\r\ngrave, and looked at the woman who sat opposite me.\r\n\r\n\"I was Miss Ida's nurse,\" said she; \"and she told me to send for you.\r\nWho are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her husband----\"\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at me with hard eyes, where intense surprise struggled\r\nwith resentment. \"Then, may God forgive you!\" she said. \"What you've\r\ndone I don't know; but it'll be 'ard work forgivin' _you_--even for\r\n_Him_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" I said, \"my wife----\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell you?\" The bitter contempt in the woman's tone did not hurt me;\r\nwhat was it to the self-contempt that had gnawed my heart all these\r\nmonths? \"Tell you? Yes, I'll tell you. Your wife was that ashamed of\r\nyou, she never so much as told me she was married. She let me think\r\nanything I pleased sooner than that. She just come 'ere an' she said,\r\n'Nurse, take care of me, for I am in mortal trouble. And don't let them\r\nknow where I am,' says she. An' me bein' well married to an honest man,\r\nand well-to-do here, I was able to do it, by the blessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you send for me before?\" It was a cry of anguish wrung from\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I'd _never_ 'a sent for you--it was _her_ doin'. Oh, to think as God\r\nA'mighty's made men able to measure out such-like pecks o' trouble for\r\nus womenfolk! Young man, I dunno what you did to 'er to make 'er leave\r\nyou; but it muster bin something cruel, for she loved the ground you\r\nwalked on. She useter sit day after day, a-lookin' at your picture an'\r\ntalkin' to it an' kissin' of it, when she thought I wasn't takin' no\r\nnotice, and cryin' till she made me cry too. She useter cry all night\r\n'most. An' one day, when I tells 'er to pray to God to 'elp 'er through\r\n'er trouble, she outs with _your_ putty face on a card, she doez, an',\r\nsays she, with her poor little smile, 'That's my god, Nursey,' she\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" I said feebly, putting out my hands to keep off the torture;\r\n\"not any more, not now.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Don't?_\" she repeated. She had risen and was walking up and down the\r\nroom with clasped hands--\"don't, indeed! No, I won't; but I shan't\r\nforget you! I tell you I've had you in my prayers time and again, when I\r\nthought you'd made a light-o'-love o' my darling. I shan't drop you\r\nouter them now I know she was your own wedded wife as you chucked away\r\nwhen you'd tired of her, and left 'er to eat 'er 'art out with longin'\r\nfor you. Oh! I pray to God above us to pay you scot and lot for all you\r\ndone to 'er! You killed my pretty. The price will be required of you,\r\nyoung man, even to the uttermost farthing! O God in heaven, make him\r\nsuffer! Make him feel it!\"\r\n\r\nShe stamped her foot as she passed me. I stood quite still; I bit my lip\r\ntill I tasted the blood hot and salt on my tongue.\r\n\r\n\"She was nothing to you!\" cried the woman, walking faster up and down\r\nbetween the rush chairs and the table; \"any fool can see that with half\r\nan eye. You didn't love her, so you don't feel nothin' now; but some day\r\nyou'll care for some one, and then you shall know what she felt--if\r\nthere's any justice in heaven!\"\r\n\r\nI, too, rose, walked across the room, and leaned against the wall. I\r\nheard her words without understanding them.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you feel _nothin'_? Are you mader stone? Come an' look at 'er\r\nlyin' there so quiet. She don't fret arter the likes o' you no more now.\r\nShe won't sit no more a-lookin' outer winder an' sayin' nothin'--only\r\ndroppin' 'er tears one by one, slow, slow on her lap. Come an' see 'er;\r\ncome an' see what you done to my pretty--an' then ye can go. Nobody\r\nwants you 'ere. _She_ don't want you now. But p'r'aps you'd like to see\r\n'er safe underground fust? I'll be bound you'll put a big slab on\r\n'er--to make sure _she_ don't rise again.\"\r\n\r\nI turned on her. Her thin face was white with grief and impotent rage.\r\nHer claw-like hands were clenched.\r\n\r\n\"Woman,\" I said, \"have mercy!\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Have mercy!\" I said again.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy? You should 'a thought o' that before. You 'adn't no mercy on\r\n'er. She loved you--she died lovin' you. An' if I wasn't a Christian\r\nwoman, I'd kill you for it--like the rat you are! That I would, though I\r\n'ad to swing for it arterwards.\"\r\n\r\nI caught the woman's hands and held them fast, in spite of her\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you understand?\" I said savagely. \"We loved each other. She died\r\nloving me. I have to live loving her. And it's _her_ you pity. I tell\r\nyou it was all a mistake--a stupid, stupid mistake. Take me to her, and\r\nfor pity's sake let me be left alone with her.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated; then said in a voice only a shade less hard--\r\n\r\n\"Well, come along, then.\"\r\n\r\nWe moved towards the door. As she opened it a faint, weak cry fell on my\r\near. My heart stood still.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" I asked, stopping on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Your child,\" she said shortly.\r\n\r\nThat, too! Oh, my love! oh, my poor love! All these long months!\r\n\r\n\"She allus said she'd send for you when she'd got over her trouble,\" the\r\nwoman said as we climbed the stairs. \"'I'd like him to see his little\r\nbaby, nurse,' she says; 'our little baby. It'll be all right when the\r\nbaby's born,' she says. 'I know he'll come to me then. You'll see.' And\r\nI never said nothin'--not thinkin' you'd come if she was your leavins,\r\nand not dreamin' as you could be 'er husband an' could stay away from\r\n'er a hour--her bein' as she was. Hush!\"\r\n\r\nShe drew a key from her pocket and fitted it to the lock. She opened the\r\ndoor and I followed her in. It was a large, dark room, full of\r\nold-fashioned furniture. There were wax candles in brass candlesticks\r\nand a smell of lavender.\r\n\r\nThe big four-post bed was covered with white.\r\n\r\n\"My lamb--my poor pretty lamb!\" said the woman, beginning to cry for the\r\nfirst time as she drew back the sheet. \"Don't she look beautiful?\"\r\n\r\nI stood by the bedside. I looked down on my wife's face. Just so I had\r\nseen it lie on the pillow beside me in the early morning when the wind\r\nand the dawn came up from beyond the sea. She did not look like one\r\ndead. Her lips were still red, and it seemed to me that a tinge of\r\ncolour lay on her cheek. It seemed to me, too, that if I kissed her she\r\nwould wake, and put her slight hand on my neck, and lay her cheek\r\nagainst mine--and that we should tell each other everything, and weep\r\ntogether, and understand and be comforted.\r\n\r\nSo I stooped and laid my lips to hers as the old nurse stole from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nBut the red lips were like marble, and she did not wake. She will not\r\nwake now ever any more.\r\n\r\nI tell you again there are some things that cannot be written.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nI lay that night in a big room filled with heavy, dark furniture, in a\r\ngreat four-poster hung with heavy, dark curtains--a bed the counterpart\r\nof that other bed from whose side they had dragged me at last.\r\n\r\nThey fed me, I believe, and the old nurse was kind to me. I think she\r\nsaw now that it is not the dead who are to be pitied most.\r\n\r\nI lay at last in the big, roomy bed, and heard the household noises grow\r\nfewer and die out, the little wail of my child sounding latest. They had\r\nbrought the child to me, and I had held it in my arms, and bowed my head\r\nover its tiny face and frail fingers. I did not love it then. I told\r\nmyself it had cost me her life. But my heart told me that it was I who\r\nhad done that. The tall clock at the stairhead sounded the\r\nhours--eleven, twelve, one, and still I could not sleep. The room was\r\ndark and very still.\r\n\r\nI had not been able to look at my life quietly. I had been full of the\r\nintoxication of grief--a real drunkenness, more merciful than the calm\r\nthat comes after.\r\n\r\nNow I lay still as the dead woman in the next room, and looked at what\r\nwas left of my life. I lay still, and thought, and thought, and thought.\r\nAnd in those hours I tasted the bitterness of death. It must have been\r\nabout two that I first became aware of a slight sound that was not the\r\nticking of the clock. I say I first became aware, and yet I knew\r\nperfectly that I had heard that sound more than once before, and had yet\r\ndetermined not to hear it, _because it came from the next room_--the\r\nroom where the corpse lay.\r\n\r\nAnd I did not wish to hear that sound, because I knew it meant that I\r\nwas nervous--miserably nervous--a coward and a brute. It meant that I,\r\nhaving killed my wife as surely as though I had put a knife in her\r\nbreast, had now sunk so low as to be afraid of her dead body--the dead\r\nbody that lay in the room next to mine. The heads of the beds were\r\nplaced against the same wall; and from that wall I had fancied I heard\r\nslight, slight, almost inaudible sounds. So when I say that I became\r\naware of them I mean that I at last heard a sound so distinct as to\r\nleave no room for doubt or question. It brought me to a sitting position\r\nin the bed, and the drops of sweat gathered heavily on my forehead and\r\nfell on my cold hands as I held my breath and listened.\r\n\r\nI don't know how long I sat there--there was no further sound--and at\r\nlast my tense muscles relaxed, and I fell back on the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"You fool!\" I said to myself; \"dead or alive, is she not your darling,\r\nyour heart's heart? Would you not go near to die of joy if she came to\r\nyou? Pray God to let her spirit come back and tell you she forgives\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish she would come,\" myself answered in words, while every fibre of\r\nmy body and mind shrank and quivered in denial.\r\n\r\nI struck a match, lighted a candle, and breathed more freely as I looked\r\nat the polished furniture--the commonplace details of an ordinary room.\r\nThen I thought of her, lying alone, so near me, so quiet under the white\r\nsheet. She was dead; she would not wake or move. But suppose she did\r\nmove? Suppose she turned back the sheet and got up, and walked across\r\nthe floor and turned the door-handle?\r\n\r\nAs I thought it, I heard--plainly, unmistakably heard--the door of the\r\nchamber of death open slowly--I heard slow steps in the passage, slow,\r\nheavy steps--I heard the touch of hands on my door outside, uncertain\r\nhands, that felt for the latch.\r\n\r\nSick with terror, I lay clenching the sheet in my hands.\r\n\r\nI knew well enough what would come in when that door opened--that door\r\non which my eyes were fixed. I dreaded to look, yet I dared not turn\r\naway my eyes. The door opened slowly, slowly, slowly, and the figure of\r\nmy dead wife came in. It came straight towards the bed, and stood at the\r\nbed-foot in its white grave-clothes, with the white bandage under its\r\nchin. There was a scent of lavender. Its eyes were wide open and looked\r\nat me with love unspeakable.\r\n\r\nI could have shrieked aloud.\r\n\r\nMy wife spoke. It was the same dear voice that I had loved so to hear,\r\nbut it was very weak and faint now; and now I trembled as I listened.\r\n\r\n\"You aren't afraid of me, darling, are you, though I am dead? I heard\r\nall you said to me when you came, but I couldn't answer. But now I've\r\ncome back from the dead to tell you. I wasn't really so bad as you\r\nthought me. Elvire had told me she loved Oscar. I only wrote the letter\r\nto make it easier for you. I was too proud to tell you when you were so\r\nangry, but I am not proud any more now. You'll love me again now, won't\r\nyou, now I'm dead? One always forgives dead people.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor ghost's voice was hollow and faint. Abject terror paralyzed me.\r\nI could answer nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Say you forgive me,\" the thin, monotonous voice went on; \"say you love\r\nme again.\"\r\n\r\nI had to speak. Coward as I was, I did manage to stammer--\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I love you. I have always loved you, God help me!\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of my own voice reassured me, and I ended more firmly than I\r\nbegan. The figure by the bed swayed a little unsteadily.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" she said wearily, \"you would be afraid, now I am dead, if I\r\ncame round to you and kissed you?\"\r\n\r\nShe made a movement as though she would have come to me.\r\n\r\nThen I did shriek aloud, again and again, and covered my face with the\r\nsheet, and wound it round my head and body, and held it with all my\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence. Then I heard my door close, and then a\r\nsound of feet and of voices, and I heard something heavy fall. I\r\ndisentangled my head from the sheet. My room was empty. Then reason came\r\nback to me. I leaped from the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Ida, my darling, come back! I am not afraid! I love you! Come back!\r\nCome back!\"\r\n\r\nI sprang to my door and flung it open. Some one was bringing a light\r\nalong the passage. On the floor, outside the door of the death-chamber,\r\nwas a huddled heap--the corpse, in its grave-clothes. Dead, dead, dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe is buried in Mellor churchyard, and there is no stone over her.\r\n\r\nNow, whether it was catalepsy--as the doctors said--or whether my love\r\ncame back even from the dead to me who loved her, I shall never know;\r\nbut this I know--that, if I had held out my arms to her as she stood at\r\nmy bed-foot--if I had said, \"Yes, even from the grave, my darling--from\r\nhell itself, come back, come back to me!\"--if I had had room in my\r\ncoward's heart for anything but the unreasoning terror that killed love\r\nin that hour, I should not now be here alone. I shrank from her--I\r\nfeared her--I would not take her to my heart. And now she will not come\r\nto me any more.\r\n\r\nWhy do I go on living?\r\n\r\nYou see, there is the child. It is four years old now, and it has never\r\nspoken and never smiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MAN-SIZE IN MARBLE._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough every word of this story is as true as despair, I do not expect\r\npeople to believe it. Nowadays a \"rational explanation\" is required\r\nbefore belief is possible. Let me then, at once, offer the \"rational\r\nexplanation\" which finds most favour among those who have heard the tale\r\nof my life's tragedy. It is held that we were \"under a delusion,\" Laura\r\nand I, on that 31st of October; and that this supposition places the\r\nwhole matter on a satisfactory and believable basis. The reader can\r\njudge, when he, too, has heard my story, how far this is an\r\n\"explanation,\" and in what sense it is \"rational.\" There were three who\r\ntook part in this: Laura and I and another man. The other man still\r\nlives, and can speak to the truth of the least credible part of my\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI never in my life knew what it was to have as much money as I required\r\nto supply the most ordinary needs--good colours, books, and\r\ncab-fares--and when we were married we knew quite well that we should\r\nonly be able to live at all by \"strict punctuality and attention to\r\nbusiness.\" I used to paint in those days, and Laura used to write, and\r\nwe felt sure we could keep the pot at least simmering. Living in town\r\nwas out of the question, so we went to look for a cottage in the\r\ncountry, which should be at once sanitary and picturesque. So rarely do\r\nthese two qualities meet in one cottage that our search was for some\r\ntime quite fruitless. We tried advertisements, but most of the desirable\r\nrural residences which we did look at proved to be lacking in both\r\nessentials, and when a cottage chanced to have drains it always had\r\nstucco as well and was shaped like a tea-caddy. And if we found a vine\r\nor rose-covered porch, corruption invariably lurked within. Our minds\r\ngot so befogged by the eloquence of house-agents and the rival\r\ndisadvantages of the fever-traps and outrages to beauty which we had\r\nseen and scorned, that I very much doubt whether either of us, on our\r\nwedding morning, knew the difference between a house and a haystack. But\r\nwhen we got away from friends and house-agents, on our honeymoon, our\r\nwits grew clear again, and we knew a pretty cottage when at last we saw\r\none. It was at Brenzett--a little village set on a hill over against the\r\nsouthern marshes. We had gone there, from the seaside village where we\r\nwere staying, to see the church, and two fields from the church we found\r\nthis cottage. It stood quite by itself, about two miles from the\r\nvillage. It was a long, low building, with rooms sticking out in\r\nunexpected places. There was a bit of stone-work--ivy-covered and\r\nmoss-grown, just two old rooms, all that was left of a big house that\r\nhad once stood there--and round this stone-work the house had grown up.\r\nStripped of its roses and jasmine it would have been hideous. As it\r\nstood it was charming, and after a brief examination we took it. It was\r\nabsurdly cheap. The rest of our honeymoon we spent in grubbing about in\r\nsecond-hand shops in the county town, picking up bits of old oak and\r\nChippendale chairs for our furnishing. We wound up with a run up to town\r\nand a visit to Liberty's, and soon the low oak-beamed lattice-windowed\r\nrooms began to be home. There was a jolly old-fashioned garden, with\r\ngrass paths, and no end of hollyhocks and sunflowers, and big lilies.\r\nFrom the window you could see the marsh-pastures, and beyond them the\r\nblue, thin line of the sea. We were as happy as the summer was glorious,\r\nand settled down into work sooner than we ourselves expected. I was\r\nnever tired of sketching the view and the wonderful cloud effects from\r\nthe open lattice, and Laura would sit at the table and write verses\r\nabout them, in which I mostly played the part of foreground.\r\n\r\nWe got a tall old peasant woman to do for us. Her face and figure were\r\ngood, though her cooking was of the homeliest; but she understood all\r\nabout gardening, and told us all the old names of the coppices and\r\ncornfields, and the stories of the smugglers and highwaymen, and, better\r\nstill, of the \"things that walked,\" and of the \"sights\" which met one in\r\nlonely glens of a starlight night. She was a great comfort to us,\r\nbecause Laura hated housekeeping as much as I loved folklore, and we\r\nsoon came to leave all the domestic business to Mrs. Dorman, and to use\r\nher legends in little magazine stories which brought in the jingling\r\nguinea.\r\n\r\nWe had three months of married happiness, and did not have a single\r\nquarrel. One October evening I had been down to smoke a pipe with the\r\ndoctor--our only neighbour--a pleasant young Irishman. Laura had stayed\r\nat home to finish a comic sketch of a village episode for the _Monthly\r\nMarplot_. I left her laughing over her own jokes, and came in to find\r\nher a crumpled heap of pale muslin weeping on the window seat.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, my darling, what's the matter?\" I cried, taking her in my\r\narms. She leaned her little dark head against my shoulder and went on\r\ncrying. I had never seen her cry before--we had always been so happy,\r\nyou see--and I felt sure some frightful misfortune had happened.\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ the matter? Do speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Mrs. Dorman,\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"What has she done?\" I inquired, immensely relieved.\r\n\r\n\"She says she must go before the end of the month, and she says her\r\nniece is ill; she's gone down to see her now, but I don't believe that's\r\nthe reason, because her niece is always ill. I believe some one has been\r\nsetting her against us. Her manner was so queer----\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Pussy,\" I said; \"whatever you do, don't cry, or I shall\r\nhave to cry too, to keep you in countenance, and then you'll never\r\nrespect your man again!\"\r\n\r\nShe dried her eyes obediently on my handkerchief, and even smiled\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\n\"But you see,\" she went on, \"it is really serious, because these village\r\npeople are so sheepy, and if one won't do a thing you may be quite sure\r\nnone of the others will. And I shall have to cook the dinners, and wash\r\nup the hateful greasy plates; and you'll have to carry cans of water\r\nabout, and clean the boots and knives--and we shall never have any time\r\nfor work, or earn any money, or anything. We shall have to work all day,\r\nand only be able to rest when we are waiting for the kettle to boil!\"\r\n\r\nI represented to her that even if we had to perform these duties, the\r\nday would still present some margin for other toils and recreations. But\r\nshe refused to see the matter in any but the greyest light. She was very\r\nunreasonable, my Laura, but I could not have loved her any more if she\r\nhad been as reasonable as Whately.\r\n\r\n\"I'll speak to Mrs. Dorman when she comes back, and see if I can't come\r\nto terms with her,\" I said. \"Perhaps she wants a rise in her screw. It\r\nwill be all right. Let's walk up to the church.\"\r\n\r\nThe church was a large and lonely one, and we loved to go there,\r\nespecially upon bright nights. The path skirted a wood, cut through it\r\nonce, and ran along the crest of the hill through two meadows, and round\r\nthe churchyard wall, over which the old yews loomed in black masses of\r\nshadow. This path, which was partly paved, was called \"the bier-balk,\"\r\nfor it had long been the way by which the corpses had been carried to\r\nburial. The churchyard was richly treed, and was shaded by great elms\r\nwhich stood just outside and stretched their majestic arms in\r\nbenediction over the happy dead. A large, low porch let one into the\r\nbuilding by a Norman doorway and a heavy oak door studded with iron.\r\nInside, the arches rose into darkness, and between them the reticulated\r\nwindows, which stood out white in the moonlight. In the chancel, the\r\nwindows were of rich glass, which showed in faint light their noble\r\ncolouring, and made the black oak of the choir pews hardly more solid\r\nthan the shadows. But on each side of the altar lay a grey marble figure\r\nof a knight in full plate armour lying upon a low slab, with hands held\r\nup in everlasting prayer, and these figures, oddly enough, were always\r\nto be seen if there was any glimmer of light in the church. Their names\r\nwere lost, but the peasants told of them that they had been fierce and\r\nwicked men, marauders by land and sea, who had been the scourge of their\r\ntime, and had been guilty of deeds so foul that the house they had lived\r\nin--the big house, by the way, that had stood on the site of our\r\ncottage--had been stricken by lightning and the vengeance of Heaven. But\r\nfor all that, the gold of their heirs had bought them a place in the\r\nchurch. Looking at the bad hard faces reproduced in the marble, this\r\nstory was easily believed.\r\n\r\nThe church looked at its best and weirdest on that night, for the\r\nshadows of the yew trees fell through the windows upon the floor of the\r\nnave and touched the pillars with tattered shade. We sat down together\r\nwithout speaking, and watched the solemn beauty of the old church, with\r\nsome of that awe which inspired its early builders. We walked to the\r\nchancel and looked at the sleeping warriors. Then we rested some time on\r\nthe stone seat in the porch, looking out over the stretch of quiet\r\nmoonlit meadows, feeling in every fibre of our being the peace of the\r\nnight and of our happy love; and came away at last with a sense that\r\neven scrubbing and blackleading were but small troubles at their worst.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dorman had come back from the village, and I at once invited her to\r\na _tête-à-tête_.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mrs. Dorman,\" I said, when I had got her into my painting room,\r\n\"what's all this about your not staying with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad to get away, sir, before the end of the month,\" she\r\nanswered, with her usual placid dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any fault to find, Mrs. Dorman?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all, sir; you and your lady have always been most kind, I'm\r\nsure----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it? Are your wages not high enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I gets quite enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why not stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather not\"--with some hesitation--\"my niece is ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your niece has been ill ever since we came.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. There was a long and awkward silence. I broke it.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you stay for another month?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. I'm bound to go by Thursday.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was Monday!\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must say, I think you might have let us know before. There's no\r\ntime now to get any one else, and your mistress is not fit to do heavy\r\nhousework. Can't you stay till next week?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might be able to come back next week.\"\r\n\r\nI was now convinced that all she wanted was a brief holiday, which we\r\nshould have been willing enough to let her have, as soon as we could\r\nget a substitute.\r\n\r\n\"But why must you go this week?\" I persisted. \"Come, out with it.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dorman drew the little shawl, which she always wore, tightly across\r\nher bosom, as though she were cold. Then she said, with a sort of\r\neffort--\r\n\r\n\"They say, sir, as this was a big house in Catholic times, and there was\r\na many deeds done here.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature of the \"deeds\" might be vaguely inferred from the inflection\r\nof Mrs. Dorman's voice--which was enough to make one's blood run cold. I\r\nwas glad that Laura was not in the room. She was always nervous, as\r\nhighly-strung natures are, and I felt that these tales about our house,\r\ntold by this old peasant woman, with her impressive manner and\r\ncontagious credulity, might have made our home less dear to my wife.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all about it, Mrs. Dorman,\" I said; \"you needn't mind about\r\ntelling me. I'm not like the young people who make fun of such things.\"\r\n\r\nWhich was partly true.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir\"--she sank her voice--\"you may have seen in the church,\r\nbeside the altar, two shapes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the effigies of the knights in armour,\" I said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"I mean them two bodies, drawed out man-size in marble,\" she returned,\r\nand I had to admit that her description was a thousand times more\r\ngraphic than mine, to say nothing of a certain weird force and\r\nuncanniness about the phrase \"drawed out man-size in marble.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do say, as on All Saints' Eve them two bodies sits up on their\r\nslabs, and gets off of them, and then walks down the aisle, _in their\r\nmarble\"_--(another good phrase, Mrs. Dorman)--\"and as the church clock\r\nstrikes eleven they walks out of the church door, and over the graves,\r\nand along the bier-balk, and if it's a wet night there's the marks of\r\ntheir feet in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where do they go?\" I asked, rather fascinated.\r\n\r\n\"They comes back here to their home, sir, and if any one meets them----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nBut no--not another word could I get from her, save that her niece was\r\nill and she must go. After what I had heard I scorned to discuss the\r\nniece, and tried to get from Mrs. Dorman more details of the legend. I\r\ncould get nothing but warnings.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you do, sir, lock the door early on All Saints' Eve, and make\r\nthe cross-sign over the doorstep and on the windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"But has any one ever seen these things?\" I persisted.\r\n\r\n\"That's not for me to say. I know what I know, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, who was here last year?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one, sir; the lady as owned the house only stayed here in summer,\r\nand she always went to London a full month afore _the_ night. And I'm\r\nsorry to inconvenience you and your lady, but my niece is ill and I\r\nmust go on Thursday.\"\r\n\r\nI could have shaken her for her absurd reiteration of that obvious\r\nfiction, after she had told me her real reasons.\r\n\r\nShe was determined to go, nor could our united entreaties move her in\r\nthe least.\r\n\r\nI did not tell Laura the legend of the shapes that \"walked in their\r\nmarble,\" partly because a legend concerning our house might perhaps\r\ntrouble my wife, and partly, I think, from some more occult reason. This\r\nwas not quite the same to me as any other story, and I did not want to\r\ntalk about it till the day was over. I had very soon ceased to think of\r\nthe legend, however. I was painting a portrait of Laura, against the\r\nlattice window, and I could not think of much else. I had got a splendid\r\nbackground of yellow and grey sunset, and was working away with\r\nenthusiasm at her face. On Thursday Mrs. Dorman went. She relented, at\r\nparting, so far as to say--\r\n\r\n\"Don't you put yourself about too much, ma'am, and if there's any\r\nlittle thing I can do next week, I'm sure I shan't mind.\"\r\n\r\nFrom which I inferred that she wished to come back to us after\r\nHalloween. Up to the last she adhered to the fiction of the niece with\r\ntouching fidelity.\r\n\r\nThursday passed off pretty well. Laura showed marked ability in the\r\nmatter of steak and potatoes, and I confess that my knives, and the\r\nplates, which I insisted upon washing, were better done than I had dared\r\nto expect.\r\n\r\nFriday came. It is about what happened on that Friday that this is\r\nwritten. I wonder if I should have believed it, if any one had told it\r\nto me. I will write the story of it as quickly and plainly as I can.\r\nEverything that happened on that day is burnt into my brain. I shall not\r\nforget anything, nor leave anything out.\r\n\r\nI got up early, I remember, and lighted the kitchen fire, and had just\r\nachieved a smoky success, when my little wife came running down, as\r\nsunny and sweet as the clear October morning itself. We prepared\r\nbreakfast together, and found it very good fun. The housework was soon\r\ndone, and when brushes and brooms and pails were quiet again, the house\r\nwas still indeed. It is wonderful what a difference one makes in a\r\nhouse. We really missed Mrs. Dorman, quite apart from considerations\r\nconcerning pots and pans. We spent the day in dusting our books and\r\nputting them straight, and dined gaily on cold steak and coffee. Laura\r\nwas, if possible, brighter and gayer and sweeter than usual, and I began\r\nto think that a little domestic toil was really good for her. We had\r\nnever been so merry since we were married, and the walk we had that\r\nafternoon was, I think, the happiest time of all my life. When we had\r\nwatched the deep scarlet clouds slowly pale into leaden grey against a\r\npale-green sky, and saw the white mists curl up along the hedgerows in\r\nthe distant marsh, we came back to the house, silently, hand in hand.\r\n\r\n\"You are sad, my darling,\" I said, half-jestingly, as we sat down\r\ntogether in our little parlour. I expected a disclaimer, for my own\r\nsilence had been the silence of complete happiness. To my surprise she\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I think I am sad, or rather I am uneasy. I don't think I'm very\r\nwell. I have shivered three or four times since we came in, and it is\r\nnot cold, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, and hoped it was not a chill caught from the treacherous\r\nmists that roll up from the marshes in the dying light. No--she said,\r\nshe did not think so. Then, after a silence, she spoke suddenly--\r\n\r\n\"Do you ever have presentiments of evil?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, smiling, \"and I shouldn't believe in them if I had.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" she went on; \"the night my father died I knew it, though he was\r\nright away in the north of Scotland.\" I did not answer in words.\r\n\r\nShe sat looking at the fire for some time in silence, gently stroking my\r\nhand. At last she sprang up, came behind me, and, drawing my head back,\r\nkissed me.\r\n\r\n\"There, it's over now,\" she said. \"What a baby I am! Come, light the\r\ncandles, and we'll have some of these new Rubinstein duets.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we spent a happy hour or two at the piano.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past ten I began to long for the good-night pipe, but\r\nLaura looked so white that I felt it would be brutal of me to fill our\r\nsitting-room with the fumes of strong cavendish.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take my pipe outside,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Let me come, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sweetheart, not to-night; you're much too tired. I shan't be long.\r\nGet to bed, or I shall have an invalid to nurse to-morrow as well as the\r\nboots to clean.\"\r\n\r\nI kissed her and was turning to go, when she flung her arms round my\r\nneck, and held me as if she would never let me go again. I stroked her\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Pussy, you're over-tired. The housework has been too much for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nShe loosened her clasp a little and drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"No. We've been very happy to-day, Jack, haven't we? Don't stay out too\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't, my dearie.\"\r\n\r\nI strolled out of the front door, leaving it unlatched. What a night it\r\nwas! The jagged masses of heavy dark cloud were rolling at intervals\r\nfrom horizon to horizon, and thin white wreaths covered the stars.\r\nThrough all the rush of the cloud river, the moon swam, breasting the\r\nwaves and disappearing again in the darkness. When now and again her\r\nlight reached the woodlands they seemed to be slowly and noiselessly\r\nwaving in time to the swing of the clouds above them. There was a\r\nstrange grey light over all the earth; the fields had that shadowy bloom\r\nover them which only comes from the marriage of dew and moonshine, or\r\nfrost and starlight.\r\n\r\nI walked up and down, drinking in the beauty of the quiet earth and the\r\nchanging sky. The night was absolutely silent. Nothing seemed to be\r\nabroad. There was no skurrying of rabbits, or twitter of the half-asleep\r\nbirds. And though the clouds went sailing across the sky, the wind that\r\ndrove them never came low enough to rustle the dead leaves in the\r\nwoodland paths. Across the meadows I could see the church tower standing\r\nout black and grey against the sky. I walked there thinking over our\r\nthree months of happiness--and of my wife, her dear eyes, her loving\r\nways. Oh, my little girl! my own little girl; what a vision came then of\r\na long, glad life for you and me together!\r\n\r\nI heard a bell-beat from the church. Eleven already! I turned to go in,\r\nbut the night held me. I could not go back into our little warm rooms\r\nyet. I would go up to the church. I felt vaguely that it would be good\r\nto carry my love and thankfulness to the sanctuary whither so many loads\r\nof sorrow and gladness had been borne by the men and women of the dead\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI looked in at the low window as I went by. Laura was half lying on her\r\nchair in front of the fire. I could not see her face, only her little\r\nhead showed dark against the pale blue wall. She was quite still.\r\nAsleep, no doubt. My heart reached out to her, as I went on. There must\r\nbe a God, I thought, and a God who was good. How otherwise could\r\nanything so sweet and dear as she have ever been imagined?\r\n\r\nI walked slowly along the edge of the wood. A sound broke the stillness\r\nof the night, it was a rustling in the wood. I stopped and listened. The\r\nsound stopped too. I went on, and now distinctly heard another step than\r\nmine answer mine like an echo. It was a poacher or a wood-stealer, most\r\nlikely, for these were not unknown in our Arcadian neighbourhood. But\r\nwhoever it was, he was a fool not to step more lightly. I turned into\r\nthe wood, and now the footstep seemed to come from the path I had just\r\nleft. It must be an echo, I thought. The wood looked perfect in the\r\nmoonlight. The large dying ferns and the brushwood showed where through\r\nthinning foliage the pale light came down. The tree trunks stood up\r\nlike Gothic columns all around me. They reminded me of the church, and I\r\nturned into the bier-balk, and passed through the corpse-gate between\r\nthe graves to the low porch. I paused for a moment on the stone seat\r\nwhere Laura and I had watched the fading landscape. Then I noticed that\r\nthe door of the church was open, and I blamed myself for having left it\r\nunlatched the other night. We were the only people who ever cared to\r\ncome to the church except on Sundays, and I was vexed to think that\r\nthrough our carelessness the damp autumn airs had had a chance of\r\ngetting in and injuring the old fabric. I went in. It will seem strange,\r\nperhaps, that I should have gone half-way up the aisle before I\r\nremembered--with a sudden chill, followed by as sudden a rush of\r\nself-contempt--that this was the very day and hour when, according to\r\ntradition, the \"shapes drawed out man-size in marble\" began to walk.\r\n\r\nHaving thus remembered the legend, and remembered it with a shiver, of\r\nwhich I was ashamed, I could not do otherwise than walk up towards the\r\naltar, just to look at the figures--as I said to myself; really what I\r\nwanted was to assure myself, first, that I did not believe the legend,\r\nand, secondly, that it was not true. I was rather glad that I had come.\r\nI thought now I could tell Mrs. Dorman how vain her fancies were, and\r\nhow peacefully the marble figures slept on through the ghastly hour.\r\nWith my hands in my pockets I passed up the aisle. In the grey dim light\r\nthe eastern end of the church looked larger than usual, and the arches\r\nabove the two tombs looked larger too. The moon came out and showed me\r\nthe reason. I stopped short, my heart gave a leap that nearly choked me,\r\nand then sank sickeningly.\r\n\r\nThe \"bodies drawed out man-size\" _were gone_, and their marble slabs lay\r\nwide and bare in the vague moonlight that slanted through the east\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nWere they really gone? or was I mad? Clenching my nerves, I stooped and\r\npassed my hand over the smooth slabs, and felt their flat unbroken\r\nsurface. Had some one taken the things away? Was it some vile practical\r\njoke? I would make sure, anyway. In an instant I had made a torch of a\r\nnewspaper, which happened to be in my pocket, and lighting it held it\r\nhigh above my head. Its yellow glare illumined the dark arches and those\r\nslabs. The figures _were_ gone. And I was alone in the church; or was I\r\nalone?\r\n\r\nAnd then a horror seized me, a horror indefinable and indescribable--an\r\noverwhelming certainty of supreme and accomplished calamity. I flung\r\ndown the torch and tore along the aisle and out through the porch,\r\nbiting my lips as I ran to keep myself from shrieking aloud. Oh, was I\r\nmad--or what was this that possessed me? I leaped the churchyard wall\r\nand took the straight cut across the fields, led by the light from our\r\nwindows. Just as I got over the first stile, a dark figure seemed to\r\nspring out of the ground. Mad still with that certainty of misfortune, I\r\nmade for the thing that stood in my path, shouting, \"Get out of the\r\nway, can't you!\"\r\n\r\nBut my push met with a more vigorous resistance than I had expected. My\r\narms were caught just above the elbow and held as in a vice, and the\r\nraw-boned Irish doctor actually shook me.\r\n\r\n\"Would ye?\" he cried, in his own unmistakable accents--\"would ye, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go, you fool,\" I gasped. \"The marble figures have gone from the\r\nchurch; I tell you they've gone.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke into a ringing laugh. \"I'll have to give ye a draught\r\nto-morrow, I see. Ye've bin smoking too much and listening to old wives'\r\ntales.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, I've seen the bare slabs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, come back with me. I'm going up to old Palmer's--his daughter's\r\nill; we'll look in at the church and let me see the bare slabs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You go, if you like,\" I said, a little less frantic for his laughter;\r\n\"I'm going home to my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish, man,\" said he; \"d'ye think I'll permit of that? Are ye to go\r\nsaying all yer life that ye've seen solid marble endowed with vitality,\r\nand me to go all me life saying ye were a coward? No, sir--ye shan't do\r\nut.\"\r\n\r\nThe night air--a human voice--and I think also the physical contact with\r\nthis six feet of solid common sense, brought me back a little to my\r\nordinary self, and the word \"coward\" was a mental shower-bath.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, then,\" I said sullenly; \"perhaps you're right.\"\r\n\r\nHe still held my arm tightly. We got over the stile and back to the\r\nchurch. All was still as death. The place smelt very damp and earthy. We\r\nwalked up the aisle. I am not ashamed to confess that I shut my eyes: I\r\nknew the figures would not be there. I heard Kelly strike a match.\r\n\r\n\"Here they are, ye see, right enough; ye've been dreaming or drinking,\r\nasking yer pardon for the imputation.\"\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes. By Kelly's expiring vesta I saw two shapes lying \"in\r\ntheir marble\" on their slabs. I drew a deep breath, and caught his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully indebted to you,\" I said. \"It must have been some trick of\r\nlight, or I have been working rather hard, perhaps that's it. Do you\r\nknow, I was quite convinced they were gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm aware of that,\" he answered rather grimly; \"ye'll have to be\r\ncareful of that brain of yours, my friend, I assure ye.\"\r\n\r\nHe was leaning over and looking at the right-hand figure, whose stony\r\nface was the most villainous and deadly in expression.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove,\" he said, \"something has been afoot here--this hand is\r\nbroken.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. I was certain that it had been perfect the last time\r\nLaura and I had been there.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps some one has _tried_ to remove them,\" said the young doctor.\r\n\r\n\"That won't account for my impression,\" I objected.\r\n\r\n\"Too much painting and tobacco will account for that, well enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along,\" I said, \"or my wife will be getting anxious. You'll come\r\nin and have a drop of whisky and drink confusion to ghosts and better\r\nsense to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to go up to Palmer's, but it's so late now I'd best leave it\r\ntill the morning,\" he replied. \"I was kept late at the Union, and I've\r\nhad to see a lot of people since. All right, I'll come back with ye.\"\r\n\r\nI think he fancied I needed him more than did Palmer's girl, so,\r\ndiscussing how such an illusion could have been possible, and deducing\r\nfrom this experience large generalities concerning ghostly apparitions,\r\nwe walked up to our cottage. We saw, as we walked up the garden-path,\r\nthat bright light streamed out of the front door, and presently saw that\r\nthe parlour door was open too. Had she gone out?\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" I said, and Dr. Kelly followed me into the parlour. It was\r\nall ablaze with candles, not only the wax ones, but at least a dozen\r\nguttering, glaring tallow dips, stuck in vases and ornaments in unlikely\r\nplaces. Light, I knew, was Laura's remedy for nervousness. Poor child!\r\nWhy had I left her? Brute that I was.\r\n\r\nWe glanced round the room, and at first we did not see her. The window\r\nwas open, and the draught set all the candles flaring one way. Her chair\r\nwas empty and her handkerchief and book lay on the floor. I turned to\r\nthe window. There, in the recess of the window, I saw her. Oh, my child,\r\nmy love, had she gone to that window to watch for me? And what had come\r\ninto the room behind her? To what had she turned with that look of\r\nfrantic fear and horror? Oh, my little one, had she thought that it was\r\nI whose step she heard, and turned to meet--what?\r\n\r\nShe had fallen back across a table in the window, and her body lay half\r\non it and half on the window-seat, and her head hung down over the\r\ntable, the brown hair loosened and fallen to the carpet. Her lips were\r\ndrawn back, and her eyes wide, wide open. They saw nothing now. What had\r\nthey seen last?\r\n\r\nThe doctor moved towards her, but I pushed him aside and sprang to her;\r\ncaught her in my arms and cried--\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, Laura! I've got you safe, wifie.\"\r\n\r\nShe fell into my arms in a heap. I clasped her and kissed her, and\r\ncalled her by all her pet names, but I think I knew all the time that\r\nshe was dead. Her hands were tightly clenched. In one of them she held\r\nsomething fast. When I was quite sure that she was dead, and that\r\nnothing mattered at all any more, I let him open her hand to see what\r\nshe held.\r\n\r\nIt was a grey marble finger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE MASS FOR THE DEAD_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was awake--widely, cruelly awake. I had been awake all night; what\r\nsleep could there be for me when the woman I loved was to be married\r\nnext morning--married, and not to me?\r\n\r\nI went to my room early; the family party in the drawing-room maddened\r\nme. Grouped about the round table with the stamped plush cover, each was\r\nbusy with work, or book, or newspaper, but not too busy to stab my heart\r\nthrough and through with their talk of the wedding.\r\n\r\nHer people were near neighbours of mine, so why should her marriage not\r\nbe canvassed in my home circle?\r\n\r\nThey did not mean to be cruel; they did not know that I loved her; but\r\nshe knew it. I told her, but she knew it before that. She knew it from\r\nthe moment when I came back from three years of musical study in\r\nGermany--came back and met her in the wood where we used to go nutting\r\nwhen we were children.\r\n\r\nI looked into her eyes, and my whole soul trembled with thankfulness\r\nthat I was living in a world that held her also. I turned and walked by\r\nher side, through the tangled green wood, and we talked of the long-ago\r\ndays, and it was, \"Have you forgotten?\" and \"Do you remember?\" till we\r\nreached her garden gate. Then I said--\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye; no, _auf wiedersehn_, and in a very little time, I hope.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she answered--\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye. By the way, you haven't congratulated me yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Congratulated you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, did I not tell you I am to marry Mr. Benoliel next month?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she turned away, and went up the garden slowly.\r\n\r\nI asked my people, and they said it was true. Kate, my dear playfellow,\r\nwas to marry this Spaniard, rich, wilful, accustomed to win, polished in\r\nmanners and base in life. Why was she to marry him?\r\n\r\n\"No one knows,\" said my father, \"but her father is talked about in the\r\ncity, and Benoliel, the Spaniard, is rich. Perhaps that's it.\"\r\n\r\nThat was it. She told me so when, after two weeks spent with her and\r\nnear her, I implored her to break so vile a chain and to come to me, who\r\nloved her--whom she loved.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right,\" she said calmly. We were sitting in the\r\nwindow-seat of the oak parlour in her father's desolate old house. \"I do\r\nlove you, and I shall marry Mr. Benoliel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look around you and ask me why, if you can.\"\r\n\r\nI looked around--on the shabby, bare room, with its faded hangings of\r\nsage-green moreen, its threadbare carpet, its patched, washed-out chintz\r\nchair-covers. I looked out through the square, latticed window at the\r\nragged, unkempt lawn, at her own gown--of poor material, though she wore\r\nit as queens might desire to wear ermine--and I understood.\r\n\r\nKate is obstinate; it is her one fault; I knew how vain would be my\r\nentreaties, yet I offered them; how unavailing my arguments, yet they\r\nwere set forth; how useless my love and my sorrow, yet I showed them to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she answered, but she flung her arms round my neck as she spoke,\r\nand held me as one may hold one's best treasure. \"No, no; you are poor,\r\nand he is rich. You wouldn't have me break my father's heart: he's so\r\nproud, and if he doesn't get some money next month, he will be ruined.\r\nI'm not deceiving any one. Mr. Benoliel knows I don't care for him; and\r\nif I marry him, he is going to advance my father a large sum of money.\r\nOh, I assure you that everything has been talked over and settled. There\r\nis no going from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Child! child!\" I cried, \"how calmly you speak of it! Don't you see that\r\nyou are selling your soul and throwing mine away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father Fabian says I am doing right,\" she answered, unclasping her\r\nhands, but holding mine in them, and looking at me with those clear,\r\ngrey eyes of hers. \"Are we to be unselfish in everything else, and in\r\nlove to think only of our own happiness? I love you, and I shall marry\r\nhim. Would you rather the positions were reversed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"for then I would make you love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps _he_ will,\" she said bitterly. Even in that moment her mouth\r\ntrembled with the ghost of a smile. She always loved to tease. She goes\r\nthrough more moods in a day than most other women in a year. Drowning\r\nthe smile came tears, but she controlled them, and she said--\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye; you see I am right, don't you? Oh, Jasper, I wish I hadn't\r\ntold you I loved you. It will only make you more unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes my one happiness,\" I answered; \"nothing can take that from me.\r\nAnd that happiness _he_ will never have. Say again that you love me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you! I love you! I love you!\"\r\n\r\nWith further folly of tears and mad loving words we parted, and I bore\r\nmy heartache away, leaving her to bear hers into her new life.\r\n\r\nAnd now she was to be married to-morrow, and I could not sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen the darkness became unbearable I lighted a candle, and then lay\r\nstaring vacantly at the roses on the wall-paper, or following with my\r\neyes the lines and curves of the heavy mahogany furniture.\r\n\r\nThe solidity of my surroundings oppressed me. In the dull light the\r\nwardrobe loomed like a hearse, and my violin case looked like a child's\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\nI reached a book and read till my eyes ached and the letters danced a\r\n_pas fantastique_ up and down the page.\r\n\r\nI got up and had ten minutes with the dumbbells. I sponged my face and\r\nhands with cold water and tried again to sleep--vainly. I lay there,\r\nmiserably wide awake.\r\n\r\nI tried to say poetry, the half-forgotten tasks of my school days even,\r\nbut through everything ran the refrain--\r\n\r\n\"Kate is to be married to-morrow, and not to me, not to me!\"\r\n\r\nI tried counting up to a thousand. I tried to imagine sheep in a lane,\r\nand to count them as they jumped through a gap in an imaginary\r\nhedge--all the time-honoured spells with which sleep is wooed--vainly.\r\n\r\nThen the Waits came, and a torture to the nerves was superadded to the\r\ntorture of the heart. After fifteen minutes of carols every fibre of me\r\nseemed vibrating in an agony of physical misery.\r\n\r\nTo banish the echo of \"The Mistletoe Bough,\" I hummed softly to myself\r\na melody of Palestrina's, and felt more awake than ever.\r\n\r\nThen the thing happened which nothing will ever explain. As I lay there\r\nI heard, breaking through and gradually overpowering the air I was\r\nsuggesting, a harmony which I had never heard before, beautiful beyond\r\ndescription, and as distinct and definite as any song man's ears have\r\never listened to.\r\n\r\nMy first half-formed thought was, \"more Waits,\" but the music was choral\r\nmusic, true and sweet; with it mingled an organ's notes, and with every\r\nnote the music grew in volume. It is absurd to suggest that I dreamed\r\nit, for, still hearing the music, I leaped out of bed and opened the\r\nwindow. The music grew fainter. There was no one to be seen in the snowy\r\ngarden below. Shivering, I shut the window. The music grew more\r\ndistinct, and I became aware that I was listening to a mass--a funeral\r\nmass, and one which I had never heard before. I lay in my bed and\r\nfollowed the whole course of the office.\r\n\r\nThe music ceased.\r\n\r\nI was sitting up in bed, my candle alight, and myself as wide awake as\r\never, and more than ever possessed by the thought of _her_.\r\n\r\nBut with a difference. Before, I had only mourned the loss of her: now,\r\nmy thoughts of her were mingled with an indescribable dread. The sense\r\nof death and decay that had come to me with that strange, beautiful\r\nmusic, coloured all my thoughts. I was filled with fancies of hushed\r\nhouses, black garments, rooms where white flowers and white linen lay in\r\na deathly stillness. I heard echoes of tears, and of dim-voiced bells\r\ntolling monotonously. I shivered, as it were on the brink of irreparable\r\nwoe, and in its contemplation I watched the dull dawn slowly overcome\r\nthe pale flame of my candle, now burnt down into its socket.\r\n\r\nI felt that I must see Kate once again before she gave herself away.\r\nBefore ten o'clock I was in the oak parlour. She came to me. As she\r\nentered the room, her pallor, her swollen eyelids and the misery in her\r\neyes wrung my heart as even that night of agony had not done. I\r\nliterally could not speak. I held out my hands.\r\n\r\nWould she reproach me for coming to her again, for forcing upon her a\r\nsecond time the anguish of parting?\r\n\r\nShe did not. She laid her hands in mine, and said--\r\n\r\n\"I am thankful you have come; do you know, I think I am going mad? Don't\r\nlet me go mad, Jasper.\"\r\n\r\nThe look in her eyes underlined her words.\r\n\r\nI stammered something and kissed her hands. I was with her again, and\r\njoy fought again with grief.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell some one. If I am mad, don't lock me up. Take care of me,\r\nwon't you?\"\r\n\r\nWould I not?\r\n\r\n\"Understand,\" she went on, \"it was not a dream. I was wide awake,\r\nthinking of you. The Waits had not long gone, and I--I was looking at\r\nyour likeness. I was not asleep.\"\r\n\r\nI shivered as I held her fast.\r\n\r\n\"As Heaven sees us, I did not dream it. I heard a mass sung, and,\r\nJasper, it was a mass for the dead. I followed the office. You are not a\r\nCatholic, but I thought--I feared--oh, I don't know what I thought. I am\r\nthankful there is nothing wrong with you.\"\r\n\r\nI felt a sudden certainty, and complete sense of power possess me. Now,\r\nin this her moment of weakness, while she was so completely under the\r\ninfluence of a strong emotion, I could and would save her from Benoliel,\r\nand myself from life-long pain.\r\n\r\n\"Kate,\" I said, \"I believe it is a warning. You shall not marry this\r\nman. You shall marry me, and none other.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned her head against my shoulder; she seemed to have forgotten\r\nher father and all the reasons for her marriage with Benoliel.\r\n\r\n\"You don't think I'm mad? No? Then take care of me; take me away; I\r\nfeel safe with you.\"\r\n\r\nThus all obstacles vanished in less time than the length of a lover's\r\nkiss. I dared not stop to consider the coincidence of supernatural\r\nwarning--nor what it might mean. Face to face with crowned hope, I am\r\nproud to remember that common sense held her own. The room in which we\r\nwere had a French window. I fetched her garden hat and a shawl from the\r\nhall, and we went out through the still, white garden. We did not meet a\r\nsoul. When we reached my father's garden I took her in by the back way,\r\nto the summer-house, and left her, though I was half afraid to leave\r\nher, while I went into the house. I snatched my violin and cheque book,\r\ntook all my spare money, scrawled a line to my father and rejoined her.\r\n\r\nStill no one had seen us.\r\n\r\nWe walked to a station five miles away; and by the time Benoliel would\r\nreach the church, I was leaving Doctors' Commons with a special licence\r\nin my pocket. Two hours later Kate was my wife, and we were quietly and\r\nprosaically eating our wedding-breakfast in the dining-room of the Grand\r\nHotel.\r\n\r\n\"And where shall we go?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she answered, smiling; \"you have not much money, have\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear me, yes. I'm not rich, but I'm not absolutely a church mouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we go to Devonshire?\" she asked, twisting her new ring round and\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\"Devonshire! Why, that is where----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know: Benoliel arranged to go there. Jasper, I am afraid of\r\nBenoliel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why----\"\r\n\r\n\"Foolish person,\" she answered. \"Do you think that Benoliel will be\r\nlikely to go to Devonshire _now_?\"\r\n\r\nWe went to Devonshire--I had had a small legacy a few months earlier,\r\nand I did not permit money cares to trouble my new and beautiful\r\nhappiness. My only fear was that she would be saddened by thoughts of\r\nher father; but I am thankful to remember that in those first days she,\r\ntoo, was happy--so happy that there seemed to be hardly room in her\r\nmind for any thought but of me. And every hour of every day I said to my\r\nsoul--\r\n\r\n\"But for that portent, whatever it boded, she might have been not my\r\nwife but his.\"\r\n\r\nThe first four or five days of our marriage are flowers that memory\r\nkeeps always fresh. Kate's face had recovered its wild-rose bloom, and\r\nshe laughed and sang and jested and enjoyed all our little daily\r\nadventures with the fullest, freest-hearted gaiety. Then I committed the\r\nsupreme imbecility of my life--one of those acts of folly on which one\r\nlooks back all one's life with a half stamp of the foot, and the\r\nunanswerable question, \"How on earth could I have been such a fool?\"\r\n\r\nWe were sitting in a little sitting-room, hideous in intention, but\r\nredeemed by blazing fire and the fact that two were there, sitting\r\nhand-in-hand, gazing into the fire and talking of their future and of\r\ntheir love. There was nothing to trouble us; no one had discovered our\r\nwhereabouts, and my wife's fear of Benoliel's revenge seemed to have\r\ndissolved before the flame of our happiness.\r\n\r\nAnd as we sat there, peaceful and untroubled, the Imp of the Perverse\r\njogged my elbow, as, alas! he does so often, and I was moved to tell my\r\nwife that I, too, had heard that unearthly midnight music--that her\r\nhearing of it was not, as she had grown to think, a mere nightmare--a\r\nstrange dream--but something more strange, more significant. I told her\r\nhow I had heard the mass for the dead, and all the tale of that night.\r\nShe listened silently, and I thought her strangely indifferent. When I\r\nhad finished, she took her hand from mine and covered her face.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it was a warning to us to flee temptation. We ought never to\r\nhave married. Oh, my poor father!\"\r\n\r\nHer tone was one that I had never heard before. Its hopeless misery\r\nappalled me. And justly. For no arguments, no entreaties, no caresses,\r\ncould win my wife back to the mood of an hour before.\r\n\r\nShe tried to be cheerful, but her gaiety was forced, and her laughter\r\nstung my heart.\r\n\r\nShe spoke no more about the music, and when I tried to reason with her\r\nabout it she smiled a gloomy little smile, and said--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot be happy. I will not be happy. It is wrong. I have been very\r\nselfish and wicked. You think me very idiotic, I know, but I believe\r\nthere is a curse on us. We shall never be happy again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you love me any more?\" I asked like a fool.\r\n\r\n\"Love you?\" She only repeated my words, but I was satisfied on that\r\nscore. But those were miserable days. We loved each other passionately,\r\nyet our hours were spent like those of lovers on the eve of parting.\r\nLong, long silences took the place of foolish little jokes and childish\r\ntalk which happy lovers know. And more than once, waking in the night, I\r\nheard my wife sobbing, and feigned sleep, with the bitter knowledge that\r\nI had no power to comfort her. I knew that the thought of her father\r\nwas with her always, and that her anxiety about him grew, day by day. I\r\nwore myself out in trying to think of some way to divert her thoughts\r\nfrom him. I could not, indeed, pay his debts, but I could have him to\r\nlive with us, a much greater sacrifice; and having a good connection,\r\nboth as a musician and composer, I did not doubt that I could support\r\nher and him in comfort.\r\n\r\nBut Kate had made up her mind that the disgrace of bankruptcy would\r\nbreak her father's heart; and my Kate is not easy to convince or\r\npersuade.\r\n\r\nAt Torquay it occurred to me that perhaps it would be well for her to\r\nsee a priest. True, Father Fabian had counselled her to marry Benoliel,\r\nbut I could hardly believe that most priests would advise a girl to\r\nmarry a bad man, whom she did not love, for the sake of any worldly gain\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nShe received the suggestion with favour, but without enthusiasm, and we\r\nsought out a Catholic church to make inquiries. As we opened the outer\r\ndoor of the church we heard music, and as we stood in the entrance and\r\nI laid my hand on the heavy inner door, my other hand was caught by\r\nKate.\r\n\r\n\"Jasper,\" she whispered, \"it is the same!\"\r\n\r\nSome person opening the door behind us compelled us to move forward. In\r\nanother moment we stood in the dusky church--stood hand-in-hand in dim\r\ndaylight, listening to the same music that each had heard in the lonely\r\nnight on the eve of our wedding.\r\n\r\nI put my arm round my wife and drew her back.\r\n\r\n\"Come away, my darling,\" I whispered; \"it is a funeral service.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes on me. \"I _must_ understand, I must see who it is. I\r\nshall go mad if you take me away now. I cannot bear any more.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked up the aisle, and placed ourselves as near as possible to the\r\nspot where the coffin lay, covered with flowers and with tapers burning\r\nabout it. And we heard that music again, every note of it the same that\r\neach had heard before. And when the service was over I whispered to the\r\nsacristan--\r\n\r\n\"Whose music was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our organist's,\" he answered; \"it is the first time they've had it.\r\nFine, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the--who was--who is being buried?\"\r\n\r\n\"A foreign gentleman, sir; they do say as his lady as was to be gave him\r\nthe slip on his wedding day, and he'd given her father thousands they\r\nsay, if the truth was known.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what was he doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's the curious part, sir. To show his independence, what does\r\nhe do but go the same tour he'd planned for his wedding trip. And there\r\nwas a railway accident, and him and every one in his carriage killed in\r\na twinkling, so to speak. Lucky for the young lady she was off with\r\nsomebody else.\"\r\n\r\nThe sacristan laughed softly to himself.\r\n\r\nKate's fingers gripped my arm.\r\n\r\n\"What was his name?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nI would not have asked: I did not wish to hear it.\r\n\r\n\"Benoliel,\" said the sacristan. \"Curious name and curious tale. Every\r\none's talking of it.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one had something else to talk of when it was found that\r\nBenoliel's pride, which had permitted him to buy a wife, had shrunk from\r\nreclaiming the purchase money when the purchase was lost to him. And to\r\nthe man who had been willing to sell his daughter, the retention of her\r\nprice seemed perfectly natural.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when she heard Benoliel's name on the sacristan's lips,\r\nall Kate's gaiety and happiness returned. She loved me, and she hated\r\nBenoliel. She was married to me, and he was dead; and his death was far\r\nmore of a shock to me than to her. Women are curiously kind and\r\ncuriously cruel. And she never could see why her father should not have\r\nkept the money. It is noteworthy that women, even the cleverest and the\r\nbest of them, have no perception of what men mean by honour.\r\n\r\nHow do I account for the music? My good critic, my business is to tell\r\nmy story--not to account for it.\r\n\r\nAnd do I not pity Benoliel? Yes. I can afford, now, to pity most men,\r\nalive or dead.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED, STAMFORD STREET AND\r\nCHARING CROSS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME.\r\n\r\nSPORT ROYAL.\r\n\r\nBY ANTHONY HOPE,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"MR.
