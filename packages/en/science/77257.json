Just exactly what became of it, no\r\n  one knows. The author, in this story, which no doubt will become a\r\n  classic some day, has approached the subject at a totally different\r\n  angle than has ever been attempted before; and let no one think\r\n  that the idea, daring and impossible as it would seem at first, is\r\n  impossible. Nor is it at all impossible that progress and science\r\n  goes and comes in waves. It may be possible that millions of years\r\n  ago, the world had reached a much higher culture than we have today.\r\n  Electricity and radio, and all that goes with it, may have been\r\n  well known eons ago, only to be swept away and rediscovered. Every\r\n  scientist knows, that practically every invention is periodically\r\n  rediscovered independently. It seems there is nothing new under the\r\n  sun._\r\n\r\n  _But the big idea behind the author’s theme is the holding of\r\n  present-day science and progress up to a certain amount of ridicule,\r\n  and showing up our civilization in a sometimes grotesque mirror,\r\n  which may not be always pleasing to our vanity and to our appraisal\r\n  of our so-called present day achievements._\r\n\r\n  _The point the author brings out is that it is one thing to have\r\n  power in science and inventions, but that it is another thing to use\r\n  that power correctly. He shows dramatically and vividly how it can be\r\n  used and how it should be used._\r\n\r\n  _From the technical standpoint, this story is tremendous, and while\r\n  some of our critics, will, as usual, find fault with the hydraulics\r\n  contained in this story, the fact remains they are not at all\r\n  impossible._\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1918 that the United States submarine X-111\r\nwas launched upon its adventurous career. The German commerce raiders\r\nhad now reached the height of their effectiveness; almost daily\r\nthey were taking their toll of luckless seamen and provision-laden\r\nsteamers; and the United States government, in alarm that was never\r\nofficially admitted, had resolved upon desperate measures. The result\r\nwas the X-111. The first of a fleet of undersea craft, this vessel\r\nwas constructed upon lines never before attempted. Not only was it\r\nexceedingly long (being about two hundred feet from stem to stern), but\r\nit was excessively narrow, and a man had to be short indeed to stand\r\nupright within it on its single deck without coming into contact with\r\nthe arching ceiling. The ship, in fact, was nothing more nor less than\r\na long pipe-like tube of reinforced steel, able to cleave the water at\r\ntremendous speed and ram and destroy any enemy by ramming it with its\r\nbeak-like prow. But this was only its slightest point of novelty. At\r\nboth ends and at several points along the sides it was equipped with\r\nwater-piercing searchlights of a power never before known (the creation\r\nof Walter Tamrock, the Kansas inventor who lost his life in the\r\nwar); and it was provided with a series of air-tight and water-proof\r\ncompartments, any one of which might be pierced without seriously\r\ninjuring the vessel as a whole. Hence the X-111 was generally known as\r\nunsinkable, and upon it the American officials fastened their hopes of\r\nabating the nuisance of the enemy “U-boat.”\r\n\r\nThe sinking of this “unsinkable” vessel is now of course a matter of\r\nhistory. Close observers of naval events will recall how, in May, 1918,\r\nthe newspapers reported the disappearance of another United States\r\nsubmarine. All that was known with certainty was, that the ship had\r\nbeen commissioned to the danger zone; that it had failed to return to\r\nits base at the expected time, and that the passing days brought no\r\nnews of it; that wireless messages and searching expeditions alike\r\nproved unavailing, and that it was two months before the only clue as\r\nto its fate was found. Then it was that a British destroyer, on scout\r\nduty in the North Sea, picked up a drifting life preserver bearing the\r\nimprint “X-111.” For strategic reasons, this fact was not divulged\r\nuntil much later, and for strategic reasons it was not made known\r\nthat the missing submarine was of a new and previously untried type;\r\nbut the mystery of the X-111’s disappearance weighed heavily upon the\r\nminds of naval officials, and secretly they resolved upon immediate and\r\nexhaustive investigation. All in vain. Not a trace of the lost ship or\r\nof the thirty-nine members of its crew could be found; not a scrap of\r\nthe usual drifting flotsam or wreckage could be picked up anywhere on\r\nthe sea; and at last it was admitted in despair that the waters would\r\nperhaps guard their secret forever.\r\n\r\nSeven years went by. Peace had long since returned, and the X-111\r\nand its tragedy had been forgotten except by a few relatives of the\r\nunfortunate thirty-nine. Then suddenly the mystery was fanned into\r\nvivid life again. A bearded man, with a strange greenish complexion and\r\neyes that blinked oddly beneath wide, colored glasses, appeared at the\r\noffices of the Navy department at Washington and claimed to be one of\r\nthe company of the X-111. At first, of course, he was merely laughed at\r\nas a madman, and could induce no one to listen to him seriously; but\r\nhe was so persistent in his pleas, and so anxious to give proof of his\r\nidentity, that a few began to suspect that there might be some shadow\r\nof truth to his claims after all. Half-heartedly, an investigation was\r\nundertaken--and with results that left the world gaping in amazement!\r\nThe testimony of a dozen witnesses, as well as the unmistakable\r\nevidence of finger-prints and handwriting, proved that the wild-looking\r\nstranger was none other than Anson Harkness, Ensign on the ill-starred\r\nX-111, long mourned as dead. Now, for the first time, the truth about\r\nthe disappearance of that remarkable vessel was to be made known; and\r\nthe eager public was treated to a story so extraordinary that only\r\nirrefutable evidence could make it seem credible. It is safe to say\r\nthat never, since Columbus returned to Spain with the news of his\r\ndiscoveries in seeking a western route to the far East, had any mariner\r\ndelivered to his people a revelation so unexampled and marvelous.\r\n\r\nBut while numerous accounts of the great discovery are extant, and\r\nwhile the furore of discussion over the newspaper articles and\r\ninterviews shows no sign of waning, the public has yet to read the\r\ntale in the words of Harkness himself. And it is for this reason that\r\nthe accompanying history, to which Harkness has devoted himself ever\r\nsince his return from exile, possesses a peculiar and timely interest.\r\nHarkness has described, unaffectedly and sincerely, the most perilous\r\nexploits which any man has ever survived. Hence the following pages\r\nshould prove entertaining not only to the student of world events, but\r\nto that larger public which finds value in a rare and stirring bit of\r\nautobiography.\r\n\r\n                                                    STANTON A. COBLENTZ,\r\n                                                    (New York, 1928.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                  Harkness Explains His Disappearance\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maiden voyage of the X-111 was ill-fated from the first. Perhaps\r\nthe new inventions had not yet been perfected, or perhaps, in the haste\r\nof wartime, adequate tests had not been made; at any rate, the vessel\r\ndeveloped mechanical troubles after her first half day at sea. To begin\r\nwith, the rudder and steering apparatus proved unmanageable; then,\r\nafter hours spent in making repairs, the engines showed a tendency\r\nto balk under the tremendous speed we were ordered to maintain; and\r\nfinally, when we had about solved the engine problem, we had the\r\nmisfortune to collide with a half-submerged derelict, while running on\r\nthe surface, and one of our water-tight compartments sprang a leak.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the accident, we had risen to the surface, for\r\nthe break was about on a level with our waterline, and the compartment\r\ncould not be completely flooded so long as we did not submerge. Yet\r\nCaptain Gavison warned us not to waste a moment, and the men worked\r\nwith desperate speed to repair the damage, for we knew that we were in\r\nthe zone of the German U-boat, and that any delay might prove perilous,\r\nif not fatal. Unfortunately, the sea was unusually calm and the day was\r\nblue and clear, so that even our low-lying hulk could be sighted many\r\nmiles across the waters.\r\n\r\nI do not know precisely at what position we were then stationed,\r\nexcept that it was somewhere in the Eastern Atlantic, and at a point\r\nwhere, according to the warnings of our Secret Service, a concentration\r\nof German submarines was to be expected. At any other time we would\r\nhave welcomed the opportunity to come to grips with the foe; but now,\r\nin our disabled condition, we kept a lookout with grave misgivings,\r\nand silently prayed that the damage might be repaired before the enemy\r\nslunk into view. Yet it was slow work to man the pumps and at the same\r\ntime to weld a strip of metal across the jagged gap in our side; and\r\nhours passed while we stood there working thigh-deep in water, our\r\nheads bent low, for there was but two or three feet of breathing space\r\nbeneath the curved iron ceiling. Suppressed growls and curses came\r\nfrom our lips each time a sudden surge of the waters interfered with\r\nthe welding. Meanwhile all was in confusion; the men worked with the\r\nfeverish inefficiency of terror, scarcely heeding the orders of the\r\nofficers; the chief contents of the compartment floated about almost\r\nunnoted. I distinctly remember that several articles, including a life\r\npreserver which one of the recruits had unfastened in his fright, were\r\nwashed overboard.\r\n\r\nStill, we did make some progress, and after four or five hours, and\r\njust as the blood-red sun was sinking low in the west, we found our\r\ntask nearing completion. A few more minutes, and the welding would\r\nbe accomplished; a few more minutes, and darkness would be upon us,\r\nleaving us free from fear of attack for the next eight or ten hours.\r\n\r\nIt was just when we felt safest that the real danger presented itself.\r\nA swift trail of white shot across the waters far to westward, and,\r\nadvancing at full speed, vanished in a long, frothy furrow just in\r\nour wake. “A German U-boat! A U-boat two points off the port bow!”\r\nfrantically cried the watch; and we scrambled from the flooded\r\ncompartment as the Captain gave the order “Submerge!” Now we heard the\r\nrapid churning of our engines as we went plunging into the blackness\r\nbeneath the sea; now we made ready to launch a torpedo of our own as\r\nour periscope showed us the disappearing tip of an enemy submarine;\r\nnow we were hurled into an exciting chase as our prodigiously powerful\r\nsearchlights illumined whole leagues of the water, even revealing the\r\ndark, cigar-shaped hulk of the foe. Had we not been impeded by the dead\r\nweight of a compartment full of water, we would unquestionably have\r\novertaken the enemy, rammed it and ended its career; even as it was, we\r\nseemed to be gaining upon it, and we had hopes of shooting up unseen\r\nand bullet-like from the dark, and with tremendous impact smiting it in\r\ntwo. Not even the unexpected appearance of a second submarine altered\r\nour plans. Handicapped as we were, we would show our superiority to\r\nboth the enemy craft!\r\n\r\nBut it was at this point that mechanical troubles again betrayed us.\r\nOverworked by our excessive burst of speed, our engines (which were of\r\nthe super-electric type recently invented by Cogswell) gave signs of\r\nslowing up and stopping; and so dangerously overheated were they, that\r\nour Captain had to halt our vessel abruptly, almost within striking\r\ndistance of the foe. Our position became extremely precarious, for at\r\nany moment the German searchlights might spy us out, and a few undersea\r\nbombs might send us to the bottom.\r\n\r\nAs our own equipment had purposely been made as light as possible, we\r\nwere provided with no explosive shells other than torpedoes: hence we\r\nwere compelled to rise to the surface in order to attack. This, we\r\nrealized, was a hazardous expedient, since both the enemy vessels were\r\nalready in a position to answer our bombardment, volley for volley.\r\nBut trusting to the gathering darkness and to our aggressive tactics\r\nto win us the advantage, we unhesitatingly rose to the level, and,\r\nwith as little delay as possible, discharged a torpedo toward the dim,\r\nlow-lying form of the foe.\r\n\r\nWhether that projectile reached its goal, none of us will ever be able\r\nto say. From the sudden, furious eruption of spray in the direction\r\nof the enemy craft, I am inclined to believe that this was among the\r\nU-boats later reported missing; yet, the torpedo may merely have\r\nstruck some floating object and so have lost its prey. Whatever the\r\nresults, we were unable to observe with certainty, for at the same\r\nmoment a gleaming streak shot toward us across the dark waters, and\r\nthe next instant we went sprawling about the deck as a dull thudding\r\ncrash came to our ears and the vessel shook and wavered as though in\r\nan earthquake’s grip. Half dazed from the shock, we gathered ourselves\r\ntogether and rose uncertainly to our feet, staring at one another in\r\ndull consternation. And at the same moment one of the seamen burst\r\nwildly into the cabin, despair and terror in his maddened eyes. “The\r\ncentral compartment!” he cried. “The central compartment. It’s flooded,\r\nall flooded!” And as if to prove his words, we felt ourselves sinking,\r\nsinking slowly, though we had not been ordered to submerge; the\r\ndarkness of the twilight skies quickly gave way to the darkness beneath\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was some minutes before we quite realized what was happening.\r\nAccustomed as we were to undersea traveling, we did not at first\r\nunderstand that this was an adventure quite out of the ordinary. Even\r\nwhen the waters had lost their first pale translucency and had become\r\nutterly black and opaque, we did not realize our terrible predicament.\r\nOnly after our vessel began listing violently, and we felt the deck\r\nsloping at an angle of forty-five degrees, did we recognize the full\r\nhorror of our position. Although we could see not one inch beyond\r\nthe thick glass portholes, I had an indefinable sense that we were\r\nsinking, sinking down, down, down through vague and unknown abysses;\r\nand the stark and helpless terror on the assembled faces gave proof\r\nthat the others shared my feelings. Not a word did we utter. Indeed,\r\nspeaking would not have been easy, for a low, continuous roaring was\r\nin our ears, a hoarse, muffled roaring reminding me of the murmuring\r\nin a sea-shell. At the same time, a strange depression overwhelmed my\r\nsenses; it seemed as though the atmosphere had suddenly become thick\r\nand heavy, too heavy for breathing; it seemed as though an unnatural\r\nweight had been piled upon me, threatening to crush and stifle me.\r\nYet I did notice that the vessel quivered violently and lunged upward\r\nevery few seconds, in a furious effort to right itself and rise to the\r\nsurface. I did fancy that I heard the buzzing of the engines at times,\r\nan intermittent buzzing that was most disquieting; and I found myself,\r\nlike the others, hanging to the brass railings to steady myself when\r\nthe ship heaved and shuddered, or to keep my footing when we slanted\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nPerhaps five minutes passed when the door leading forward was thrust\r\nopen, and Captain Gavison climbed precariously into the room. All\r\neyes were bent upon him in silent inquiry; but his grim, stoically\r\nfirm countenance was far from reassuring. It was apparent that he had\r\nsomething to say, and that he did not care to say it; and several\r\nanxious moments elapsed while he stood glowering upon us, evidently\r\nundecided whether to give his message words.\r\n\r\nYet even at this crisis he could not forget discipline. His first words\r\nbrought us no information, and his first action was to station us about\r\nthe room in orderly fashion, assigning each to some specific duty.\r\n\r\n“I will not keep the facts from you,” he declared, with slow,\r\ndeliberate accentuation, when finally we were all in position. “Three\r\nof our compartments are flooded. The other compartments seem to be\r\nholding out as yet, but the great mass of water in our hold is bearing\r\nus rapidly downward, and the engines seem unable to neutralize the\r\neffect. At the last reading, we were nine hundred and twenty-seven feet\r\nbelow sea level.”\r\n\r\n“Great God! What are we to do about it?” I gasped, in biting terror.\r\n\r\n“Suggestions are in order,” stated the Captain, laconically.\r\n\r\nBut no suggestion was forthcoming.\r\n\r\n“Of course, we are in no immediate danger ...” he resumed. But he\r\nmight have spared his words. Most of us had had sufficient experience\r\nof undersea travel to know that the danger was real enough. Barring\r\nthe remote contingency that the engines would be brought back into\r\nefficient working order, there were only two possibilities. On the one\r\nhand, we might reach the bottom of the sea, and, stranded there, would\r\nperish of starvation or slow suffocation. Or, in the second place, we\r\nmight continue drifting downward until the tremendous pressure of the\r\nwater, proving too strong even for the stout steel envelope of our\r\nvessel, would bend and crush it like an egg-shell.\r\n\r\nAlthough we could no longer guide our course, our gigantic searchlights\r\nwere at once brought into play, piercing the water with brilliant\r\nyellow streamers. Yet they might have been searchlights in a tomb,\r\nfor they showed us nothing except the minute wavy dark shapes that\r\noccasionally drifted in and out of our line of vision. There was\r\nsomething ghastly, I thought, about that light, that intense unearthly\r\nsallow light, which glided slowly in long curves and spirals about the\r\nthick enveloping darkness. And the very penetrating power of the rays\r\nserved only to accentuate the horror. For the illumination ended in\r\nnothingness; nothingness seemed to stretch above us, beneath us, and\r\nto all sides of us; we were enfolded in it as in a black mantle; it\r\nseemed to be stretching out long arms to fetter us, to gather us up, to\r\nstrangle us slyly.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlowly, with agonizing slowness, the moments crept by; slowly we\r\ncontinued sinking, down, down, down, ever down and down, with movement\r\ngradual and constantly diminishing, yet never ceasing. Never before in\r\nhistory, we told ourselves, had living men been plunged so far beneath\r\nthe ocean. Our instruments recorded first twelve hundred feet, then\r\nfourteen, then sixteen, then eighteen hundred feet below sea level!\r\n\r\nAnd as we sank downward, we became aware that we were not the only\r\nliving creatures in these depths. Our searchlights made us the center\r\nof attraction for myriads of scaly things; whole schools and squadrons\r\nof fishes were gathering moth-like in the vivid illumination thrown\r\nout by our vessel. Some were long, snaky monsters, with thin heads set\r\nwith rows of spike-like teeth, and tiny eyes that gleamed evilly in\r\nthe uncanny light; some were lithe sea dragons, with wolfish mouths\r\nand sabre-like bony appendages projecting from low foreheads; some\r\nwere many-colored, rainbow-hued or streaked with black and golden,\r\nor red and azure, or yellow and white; some had chameleon eyes that\r\nflashed first green and then blue, according to the play of the light\r\nabout them; many were flitting to and fro, circling and spiralling\r\nand doubling back and forth at incredible speed; and not a few,\r\nunacquainted with the ways of submarines, collided full-tilt with the\r\nthick glass of our portholes.\r\n\r\nBut as our depth gradually increased, our finny visitors began to\r\ngive way to others stranger still. When we were twenty-two hundred\r\nfeet below the surface, the searchlights were no longer necessary\r\nto reveal the denizens of the deep, for the inhabitants of those\r\nunthinkable regions carried their own lamps! And how they amazed us\r\nand startled us!--how, in our shuddering nerve-racking terror, they\r\nappeared to us as ghosts or avenging fiends, or struck our overworked\r\nimaginations as approaching foes or rescuers! Suddenly, out of the\r\ndeathly blackness, a spurt of green light appeared, swiftly widening\r\nuntil it seemed an unearthly searchlight--and, from a narrow focus of\r\nflame, two huge burning green eyes would shoot forth, darting cold\r\nmalice at us through the glass port, until the yellow electric light\r\nwould seem tinged with an emerald reflection. Or else a tiny flattened\r\ndisk, softly phosphorescent throughout and marked on one surface by two\r\nbright beady eyes, would come floating in our direction like a pale\r\napparition; or, again, a long dark rod, brilliantly white like a living\r\nflashlight, would dart curving and gleaming toward us out of the remote\r\ngloomy depths. But more terrifying than any of these were the nameless\r\nmonsters with invisible bodies and lidless, fiery yellow eyes of the\r\nsize of baseballs,--eyes that stared in at us, and stared and stared,\r\nas though all the concentrated horror of the universe were glaring upon\r\nus, seeking to ferret us out and mark us for its victims.\r\n\r\nAnd still we were sinking, unceasingly sinking, till the last faint\r\nhope had died in the heart of the most sanguine, and in despair and\r\nwith half-mumbled phrases we admitted that there could be no rescue\r\nfor us. When we were twenty-five hundred feet below the surface, the\r\nfury of expectation had given place to a blank and settled despondency;\r\nwhen the distance was twenty-eight hundred feet, each was striving in\r\nhis own way to prepare himself for the fate which all felt to be but a\r\nquestion of hours. In our panic-stricken horror, we had all long ago\r\nforgotten the positions assigned us by the Captain; and the Captain\r\nhimself did not appear to notice where we were. Young Rawson, the\r\nnewest of the recruits, had gone down on his knees, and with tears in\r\nhis eyes was murmuring half audible prayers; Matthew Stangale, one\r\nof the oldest and most hardened of the seamen, was pacing restlessly\r\nback and forth, back and forth, in the narrow compartment, clenching\r\nhis fists furiously and muttering to himself; Daniel Howlett, veteran\r\nof many campaigns, contented himself with a suppressed growling and\r\nprofanity, and his curses were echoed by his companions; Frank Ripley,\r\na college gridiron hero, enlisted for the war, buried himself in a\r\ncorner of the room, his face covered by his hands, the very picture of\r\ndejection, though every once in a while, wistfully and half-furtively,\r\nhe would let his gaze travel to a little photograph he guarded close\r\nto his bosom. And as for Captain Gavison, on whom we had fastened our\r\nlast fading hope of escape--he merely stood near the porthole with arms\r\nclenched behind his back and thin lips tightly compressed, peering out\r\ninto the black waters as though he read there some secret hidden from\r\nthe obtuse gaze of his followers.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were below the three thousand foot level when fresh cause for\r\nanxiety appeared. “The holy saints have mercy on us!” suddenly\r\nexclaimed James Stranahan, one of the common seamen, as he crossed\r\nhimself piously. And pointing in awe-stricken amazement through one of\r\nthe glass spy-holes which led from the deck, down through the bottom\r\nof the ship, he called attention to a dim shimmering luminescence far\r\nbelow. Excitedly we crowded about him, almost tumbling over one another\r\nin our eagerness and terror, but for a moment we could see nothing.\r\nThen, slowly, as we stood straining our eyes to fathom the blackness,\r\nwe became aware of a vague filmy, widespread sheet of light twinkling\r\nfaintly beneath us, and remote as the stars of an inverted Milky Way.\r\n\r\nA sheet of light beneath us, at the bottom of the sea! In incredulous\r\nastonishment, we turned to one another, scarcely able to believe our\r\nsenses, our horror written plainly in our gaping eyes! And in silence,\r\nand with fear-blanched faces, half of the company made the sign of the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s a ghost, a deep-sea ghost!” ventured the superstitious\r\nStranahan.\r\n\r\n“It’s where the sea serpents have their home!” put in Stangale, with\r\nan abortive attempt to be jocular. “There’s ten million of them down\r\nthere, with devil’s eyes of fire!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe it’s the Evil One himself!” suggested Stranahan, not content\r\nwith a single guess. “What if it’s the very throne-room of Hell, and\r\nthem are the flames of Old Nick!”\r\n\r\nThese words did not seem to reassure the rest of the crew. Several were\r\ntrembling visibly, and several continued to cross themselves in silence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Captain had ordered the searchlights turned downward, and\r\nin long loops and curves the cutting light swept the darkness beneath.\r\nBut not a thing was visible, except for a few flapping fishy forms; and\r\nour lanterns served only to conceal the mysterious luminescence.\r\n\r\nYet, when the searchlights were again directed upward, that\r\nluminescence became more distinct and seemed to stretch to infinite\r\ndistances on all sides. But it was still incalculably remote, and still\r\nfilled us with alarm and foreboding. Whatever it was (and we could not\r\nhelp feeling that it was evil), we knew that it was a thing beyond the\r\nreach of all human experience; whatever it was, it was a monstrous\r\nthing, possibly malevolent and terrible, and not inconceivably ghostly\r\nand supernatural.\r\n\r\nBut as we continued to sink, I began to doubt whether any of us should\r\nlive to solve the mystery. The air in our overcrowded compartments was\r\nbecoming oppressively heavy and vitiated; we were like men locked in\r\nsealed vaults, and there was no possibility of renewing our exhausted\r\noxygen supply. Already I was beginning to feel drowsy from the lack of\r\nair; my head was aching dully and I had almost ceased to care where we\r\nwent or what befell us. Today, when I look back upon the racking events\r\nof those terrible hours, I feel sure that I was not far from delirium;\r\nand when I recall how some of my comrades reclined drunkenly on the\r\nfloor, with half-hysterical mumblings and wailings, I am certain that\r\nthere were but few of us, who retained our right senses.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, a blank space in my memory concerning what occurred\r\nat about this time; I may have fallen off into a doze or sodden slumber\r\nlasting for minutes or even for hours. I can only say that I have a\r\nrecollection of coming abruptly to myself, as from a state of coma;\r\nand, with a sudden jolt of understanding, I realized where I was, and\r\nobserved with a shock that half a dozen of my comrades were gathered\r\ntogether in a little group, pointing downward with excited exclamations.\r\n\r\nStaggering to my feet, I joined them, and in a moment shared in their\r\nagitation. The lights beneath us were now far brighter--they no longer\r\nformed a vague shimmering screen, but were concentrated brilliantly\r\nin a score of golden globes of the apparent size of the sun. “Could\r\nit be that the ocean too has its suns?” I asked myself, as when one\r\nasks dazed questions in a dream. And looking at those spectral lights\r\nthat wavered and gleamed through the pale translucent waters, I felt\r\nthat this was surely but a nightmare from which I should soon awaken.\r\nFantastic fish, with triangular glowing red heads and searchlight eyes\r\nprojected on slender tubes, darted before our windows in innumerable\r\nschools; but these seemed almost familiar now by comparison with those\r\neerie golden lights below; and it was upon the golden illumination that\r\nmy gaze was riveted as we settled slowly down and down. Soon it became\r\napparent that the great central globes were not the only source of the\r\nradiance, for smaller points of light gradually became visible, some\r\nof them moving, actually moving as though borne by living hands!--and\r\neven the spaces between the lights seemed to wear an increasing\r\ngolden luster! Yet with the golden was mingled a singular tinge of\r\ngreen, a green that seemed scarcely of the waters; and the mysterious\r\ndepths were no longer black, but olive-hued, as though the light came\r\nfiltering to us through some solid dark-green medium.\r\n\r\nBut a more imminent peril was to distract our attention from the weird\r\nlights. For some minutes I had been vaguely aware of something peculiar\r\nin the aspect of our compartment; yet, in my stupefied condition, I had\r\nnot been able to determine just what was wrong. But full realization\r\ncame to me when Stranahan, pointing upward, wide-eyed with horror,\r\nsuddenly exclaimed, “Heaven preserve us, look at the ceiling!”\r\n\r\nWe all looked. The ceiling was bulging inches downward, as though the\r\nterrific pressure of the waters were already bursting the tough steel\r\nenvelope of the X-111. And at the same time we observed that the deck\r\nwe stood on was bulging upward, and that the bulkheads were being\r\ntwisted and distorted like iron rails warped by an earthquake.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut now came the greatest surprise of all. “By all the saints and\r\nlittle devils!” burst forth the irrepressible Stranahan, pointing\r\ndownward and forgetting the aspect of the bulkheads and deck. “There’s\r\na city under the sea!”\r\n\r\n“A city under the sea!” we echoed, in stupefied amazement. And from one\r\ncorner of the room came a burst of hysterical laughter, which wavered\r\nand broke and then died out, sounding uncannily like a fiend’s derision.\r\n\r\n“But I tell you, there is a city under the sea!” insisted Stranahan,\r\nnoting the incredulous stares with which we regarded him. “The Lord\r\nstrike me dead if I didn’t see its streets and houses!”\r\n\r\nThough none of us doubted but that the Lord would indeed do as\r\nStranahan suggested, we interpreted his remarks as mere delirious\r\nravings, and continued to stare at him in petrified silence.\r\n\r\n“You see, there she is!” persisted the seaman, still pointing downward\r\nregardless of our disbelief. And, crossing himself piously, he\r\ncontinued, in awed tones, “May the Virgin have pity on us, if that\r\ndon’t look like a church!”\r\n\r\nStranahan’s last words had such a tone of conviction that, though our\r\ndoubts were still strong, we could not forebear to look. And, after\r\na single glance, our scepticism gave place to dumbfounded amazement.\r\nFor was this not a city staring up at us from the green-golden depths?\r\nOr at least the ruins of what had been a city? In outlines wavy\r\nbecause of the dense, shifting waters, and yet as definite of form as\r\nreflections in a still pool, half a dozen great yellow-white temples\r\nseemed to glimmer beneath the brilliant lights, with massive columns,\r\nwide-reaching porticoes and colonnades, and gracefully curving arches\r\nand domes.\r\n\r\nWas this but a mirage? we asked ourselves. Or were these the remains\r\nof some submerged, ancient town? Never had we heard of mirages beneath\r\nthe sea--but if this were a dead city, then why these vivid lights?\r\nAnd, certainly, no living city could be imagined in these profound\r\nwatery abysses.\r\n\r\nEven as we wondered, we seemed to note a gradual change in our\r\nmovement. We were no longer sinking; we were drifting with slow motion,\r\nalmost horizontally; and just beneath us appeared to be an impenetrable\r\nbut transparent dense, greenish wall, a wall that--had the idea not\r\nbeen too preposterous--we might almost have imagined to be of glass.\r\nBeneath this wall gleamed no lantern-bearing, fishy eyes, but the\r\ndazzling golden orbs and the smaller scattered lights shone steadily\r\nwith piercing radiance; and beneath us, at a distance that may have\r\nbeen five hundred feet and may have been a thousand, the vaults and\r\ndomes and columns of innumerable stone edifices shone palely and with\r\nsallow luster. Surely, we thought, this was some unheard-of Athens,\r\ndoomed long ago by tidal wave or volcano.\r\n\r\nGradually, for some reason that we could not quite explain, our\r\nhorizontal motion seemed to be increasing; and, caught apparently by\r\nsome rapid deep-sea current, we drifted with appreciable velocity above\r\nthose dim realms of green and golden. Palace after magnificent palace,\r\nmany seemingly modelled by architects of old Greece, went gliding by\r\nbeneath us; countless statues, tall as the buildings, pointed up at us\r\nwith hands that were uncannily life-like; wide avenue after wide avenue\r\nflashed by, and one or two colossal theatres of old Grecian design; but\r\nno living thing was to be seen, or, at least, so it seemed, for though\r\nwe strained our eyes, we could discern only shadows moving in those\r\nuncertain depths, only shadows and an occasional firefly light which\r\nzigzagged fitfully among the buildings and which we took to be some\r\nstrange illuminated finny thing.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, for no apparent reason, fresh terror seized us.\r\nPerhaps it was because we realized abruptly the full eerie horror of\r\nfloating thus above a city of the dead; perhaps it was that the whole\r\nunspeakable ghastliness of the adventure had again flashed upon us. Be\r\nthat as it may, we began to shake and shiver once more as though in the\r\ngrip of a mastering emotion, or as though obsessed by forethought of\r\napproaching disaster; and muttered prayers again were heard, and more\r\nthan one silent tear was shed.\r\n\r\nBut the time for tears and prayers was over. Our motion, gradually\r\nincreasing for some minutes, was suddenly accelerated as if by some\r\ngigantic prod; we seemed caught in some mighty movement of the waters,\r\nsome maelstrom that whirled us about and buffeted us like a feather;\r\na hoarse, continuous thunder dinned in our ears, and we went shooting\r\nforward with prodigious speed. Then came a violent jerk, and we found\r\nourselves tossed pellmell to all corners of the room; then another\r\njerk, and we were flung back again like dice shaken in a box; then\r\nstill another jerk, more vehement than the others, and our terrorized\r\nminds lost track of events as our vessel lunged and heaved, then veered\r\nand stood almost on end, then began to spin round and round, like a\r\nswift gyrating top ... And in that whirling confusion our senses reeled\r\nand grew blurred, and darkness came clouding back, darkness and sleep\r\nand nothingness ...\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our searchlights made us the center of attraction\r\nfor myriads of scaly things; whole schools and squadrons of fishes\r\nwere gathering moth-like in the vivid illumination thrown out by our\r\nvessel ... flitting to and fro, circling and spiralling and doubling\r\nback and forth at incredible speed.]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           Untraveled Depths\r\n\r\n\r\nHow any of us chanced to survive is more than I can say. In the\r\nturbulence and vertigo of that last blind roaring moment, I had vaguely\r\nfelt that we had reached the end of all things; hence it was almost\r\nwith surprise that I found myself hazily regaining consciousness, and\r\ndiscovered that I could still move my limbs and open my eyes. At first,\r\nindeed, I had the dim sense that I was dead and embarking upon the\r\nAfterlife; and it was only the definite sensation of pain in my bruised\r\narms and legs, and the definite sight of my comrades tumbled about in\r\nungainly attitudes, which convinced me that I was still on the better\r\nknown side of the grave.\r\n\r\n“Sure, and I thought we went through the very gates of Hell!” came a\r\nfamiliar voice; and Stranahan rose unsteadily to his feet, lugubriously\r\nnursing a sprained wrist. “By all the saints in heaven, we must be a\r\ndevilish lot! The devil himself didn’t seem able to get us!”\r\n\r\nCheered by sound of a human voice, I followed Stranahan’s example, and\r\nslowly and painfully arose. I was thankful to learn that, although\r\nbadly battered, I had suffered no broken bones; and as my comrades one\r\nby one staggered up from the deck, I was glad to observe that none were\r\ngravely injured.\r\n\r\nOur vessel had assumed a horizontal position again, but I felt that\r\nour surroundings were strangely altered. While a pale luminescence\r\nseemed to transfuse the waters on both sides and above us, yet below\r\nus the golden lights were no longer visible, and everything seemed\r\nimpenetrably black.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Captain again ordered the searchlights turned on--and\r\nthis time with extraordinary results. Just beneath us, actually in\r\ncontact with the bottom of the X-111, a flat, sandy reach of ground\r\nwas visible--certainly, the bottom of the sea! But this fact was the\r\nleast remarkable of all. On both sides of us, at distances possibly of\r\ntwo hundred yards, a high and geometrically regular embankment shot\r\nup precipitously, ending in a yellow illuminated patch of water whose\r\nnature we could scarcely surmise. The one thing apparent was that we\r\nwere in a submarine channel, a sort of river bed in the bottom of the\r\nsea. This fact was made evident by a current which sent us skimming\r\nalong the soft sands although our engines had long since ceased to\r\nsupply us with power.\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand it!” sighed Captain Gavison, shaking his head\r\ndolefully. “I can’t understand it at all! For twenty-five years I’ve\r\nstudied the ocean currents, but I’ve never before heard of anything\r\nlike this!”\r\n\r\nJust at this point our searchlights showed us a long, lithe dark form\r\ngliding rapidly by through the waters perhaps fifty feet above. It was\r\nas large as the largest known shark, but was shaped like no fish I had\r\never seen, tapering to a slender, canoe-like point at both ends; and,\r\nas it passed, the water seemed to foam and bubble strangely in its wake.\r\n\r\n“Perdition take me, if it ain’t a sea dragon!” ventured Stranahan, who\r\nhad to have his say.\r\n\r\n“Stranahan, be silent!” snapped the Captain, in high irritation.\r\n“You’re always saying the wrong thing at the wrong time!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” admitted Stranahan, meekly, a grave expression in his pale\r\nblue eyes.\r\n\r\n“If you want to make yourself useful, Stranahan,” continued the Captain\r\nseverely, although with less asperity than before, “go forward, and\r\nfind out how far we are beneath sea level.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, sir,” agreed Stranahan, remembering to salute.\r\n\r\n“How far below were we at the last reading, sir?” I inquired of the\r\nCaptain, after Stranahan had vanished through the small compartment\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Thirty-seven hundred feet,” returned the officer, abruptly. “But we’ve\r\nsunk considerably since then.”\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Stranahan reappeared in the doorway, a\r\nstare of blank, incredulous astonishment on his lean, hardened face.\r\n\r\n“Well?” the Captain demanded. “How far below are we now?”\r\n\r\nStranahan mopped his brow as if to wipe off an invisible perspiration.\r\nBut he answered not a word.\r\n\r\n“Stranahan,” growled the exasperated officer, somewhat after the manner\r\nof a schoolma’am to an unruly pupil, “do you hear me? I’m asking to\r\nknow how far below we are now.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” drawled Stranahan, saluting mechanically, “wouldn’t I be\r\ntelling you if I knew? But, saints in heaven, sir, that machine must be\r\nbewitched! Else I’m seeing things!”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you notice the reading?” bawled the Captain.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” Stranahan replied, humbly. “That’s what the trouble is,\r\nsir.”\r\n\r\n“Then how far below are we?”\r\n\r\nStranahan hesitated as though he would rather not speak. “Forty-four\r\nfeet,” he muttered, at length.\r\n\r\nA murmur of suppressed excitement passed from end to end of the room.\r\n“Forty-four feet!” yelled the Captain. “You mean forty-four hundred!”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” maintained Stranahan, quietly. “I mean forty-four.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Captain’s anger became uncontrollable. “Stranahan, you must take me\r\nfor a fool!” he shouted. “This is not the moment for practical jokes!\r\nAt any other time I’d have you thrown in the brig!”\r\n\r\n“But, sir----” Stranahan started to protest.\r\n\r\n“That’s enough!” roared the officer, fairly shaking with fury. And,\r\nturning to one of the younger men, he commanded, “Ripley, see how far\r\nbelow water level we are!”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, sir,” assented Ripley, and left the room.\r\n\r\nA moment later he returned with a sheepish grin on his face.\r\n\r\n“Well, how far below are we?” demanded the Captain.\r\n\r\nBut Ripley, like Stranahan, seemed reluctant to speak. He coughed,\r\ngasped, stammered out an unintelligible syllable or two, cleared his\r\nthroat, stood gaping at us stupidly while we looked on expectantly, and\r\nfinally blurted out, “Forty---- forty-three feet, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Forty-three feet!” bellowed the Captain. “Has the whole crew gone\r\ncrazy?”\r\n\r\nAnd, without further ado, Gavison himself went lunging toward the door,\r\nand disappeared in the forward compartment.\r\n\r\nIt was several minutes before he returned. But when he rejoined us,\r\nhis face wore a look of undisguised amazement. Furtively and almost\r\nshamefacedly he peered at us, like one who fancies he is losing his\r\nwits.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, how far below are we now?” I questioned.\r\n\r\nThe Captain cleared his throat, and hesitated perceptibly before\r\nreplying. “I---- I really don’t know. I can’t understand---- I can’t\r\nunderstand it at all. If the instruments aren’t out of order, we’re\r\nexactly forty-two feet below!”\r\n\r\nI gasped stupidly; then suggested, “No doubt, sir, the instruments are\r\nout of order.”\r\n\r\n“They are not!” denied the Captain. “I’ve tested them!”\r\n\r\nAgain the Captain hesitated briefly; then abruptly he resumed,\r\n“Besides, as you know, there are two instruments. They both record\r\nforty-two feet. Surely, they can’t both be wrong in exactly the same\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nThere ensued a moment of silence, during which we stared dully at one\r\nanother, filled with mute questionings we would not dare to put into\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“But how do you explain----” I at length started to inquire.\r\n\r\n“I don’t explain at all!” interrupted the officer. “We’re simply\r\nrunning counter to all natural laws! According to all estimates, we\r\nshould be nearly a mile deep by now!”\r\n\r\nAnd the Captain stood stroking his chin in grave perplexity. Then\r\nturning suddenly to us all, he remarked, “I can’t see how it can be\r\ntrue, boys; but if we’re only forty-two feet deep, then maybe the\r\nengines will have life enough in them to pull us out. At least, it’s a\r\nchance worth taking.”\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, after a few instructions and the assignment of the\r\ncrew to duty, we had the pleasure of hearing once more the churning\r\nand throbbing of the engines. At first it promised to be a barren\r\npleasure indeed, for the abused machinery gasped and sputtered as\r\nthough determined upon a permanent strike; but finally after many vain\r\nefforts, we were greeted by the continuous buzzing of the motors. Then\r\nwe found ourselves slowly moving, at first scarcely faster than the\r\ncurrent, but with gradually increasing velocity; and by degrees we\r\nfelt the deck taking on an upward slope as the nose of the vessel was\r\npointed toward the surface of the waters. It was not an easy pull,\r\nfor our three flooded compartments were powerfully inclined to hold\r\nus to the bottom; and in the beginning we made very little progress;\r\nseveral times we felt our hull scraping the ocean floor. Eventually,\r\nthe engines, waxing to their full power, began to cleave the water at\r\ngratifying speed, and we found that we were moving definitely, though\r\nslowly upward.\r\n\r\nOf course, hope came to us then in a powerful wave, accompanied by\r\nblack flashes of despair, for what if impassable thousands of feet\r\nof water still rolled above us? Impatiently we fastened our eyes on\r\nthe pressure gauges, and impatiently watched the registered distance\r\ndwindle from forty feet to thirty-five, from thirty-five to thirty,\r\nfrom thirty to twenty-five, and from twenty-five to twenty! And now, in\r\na sudden wild burst of joy, we realized that probably we were saved! A\r\npale but unmistakable radiance was seeping in through the glass ports,\r\na radiance far more distinct and reassuring than the eerie luminescence\r\nwe had noticed before. Certainly, this was the sunlight--and in a few\r\nmoments we might bask again in the warmth of day!\r\n\r\nAnd as we rose from twenty feet to fifteen, and from fifteen to ten,\r\nour hopes found increasing fuel. The light filtering in through the\r\nwindows brightened at a rate that was more than heartening--and through\r\nthe clear waters, even without the aid of the searchlights, we could\r\ndistinguish a steep embankment, perhaps fifty or a hundred yards away.\r\nAnd just above us, almost within grasping distance, we thought we could\r\nnotice the line where water met air!\r\n\r\nBut we had no intimation of the surprise that lay in store for us.\r\nToday, as I look back upon those events with clear perspective, it\r\nseems incredible to me that we could actually have expected to escape\r\nat once to the upper world. But hope had doubtless blinded our eyes and\r\nsuffering blunted our perceptions, so that we could not understand that\r\nwe were at the beginning, rather than at the end of our adventures.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly, with a furious lunge and an unwonted, violent burst of\r\nspeed, we found ourselves launched upward toward the wavy, light-shot\r\nlevel that was our goal; and now a blinding brilliance was upon us,\r\nand for a moment we had to shade our eyes to shield them from the\r\ndazzling change. Then, when by degrees we were able to glance again\r\nabout us, we found that we were on the surface of the waters, actually\r\non the surface!--but where was this that we had come up? and in what\r\nstrange and unmapped continent? There was scarcely one of us that\r\ncould suppress a cry of astonishment--we were afloat, not upon the\r\nocean, as we had expected, but rather on a wide and rapidly flowing\r\nriver--a river that washed no shores, ever described by human tongue!\r\nAltogether, it was one of the weirdest and most magnificent lands\r\nimaginable; on both sides of the stream spread a flat plain, dotted\r\nwith great sea shells and greenish boulders, which in their turn were\r\ninterspersed with a mossy brown vegetation and pale, graceful flowers\r\nlike waterlilies on solitary stalks. At measured intervals, as far as\r\nthe eye could reach, were colossal stone columns, enriched with pastel\r\ntintings of pink and blue; and these shot upward hundreds of feet\r\nas though supporting some titanic dome, ending, unaccountably, in a\r\ndark, green sky from which glared several sun-like, golden orbs, which\r\nsuffused the scene in a mellow, unearthly luster that was beautiful,\r\nyet terrifying and ghostly.\r\n\r\nRubbing our eyes, like children still not half awake, we gazed at this\r\nfantastic, lovely spectacle. Not a word did we speak; we could not have\r\nfound language to voice our amazement. Only the Captain, out of the\r\nwhole thirty-nine of us, retained some measure of self-possession; and\r\nthough, as he afterwards confessed, he was so dazzled that he spoke and\r\nacted mechanically, he did retain the presence of mind to order our\r\nvessel steered to shore and anchored.\r\n\r\nIt is still a marvel to me that we had the energy to carry out these\r\ncommands. Somehow we brought the X-111 to land; and somehow, after\r\nseveral false starts, we managed to moor the ship to a large boulder in\r\na sort of miniature bay.\r\n\r\nAnd then Stranahan proved again that he possessed an original mind. Not\r\nonly was he the first to force himself out of the opening door of the\r\nsubmarine, but he carried out a large American flag, which he planted\r\nin the ground among the brown weeds between the boulders, while with\r\nsedate and ceremonious gestures, he proclaimed, “In the name of the\r\nUnited States of America, I take possession of this land!”\r\n\r\nBut the rest of us gave no heed to his words. We were taking deep,\r\nrefreshing breaths of the pure, clean air, which came to us almost like\r\na mercy from heaven after the suffocating atmosphere of the submarine.\r\nAnd before we had had half the needed time to revive our starving\r\nlungs, an astounding phenomenon, as unexpected as the very discovery of\r\nthis spectral region, was to drive Stranahan from our thoughts at the\r\nsame time that it flooded our minds with terror. For the golden lights\r\nabove suddenly flickered, gave out a fugitive spark or two, and with\r\nmeteor swiftness went out. We found ourselves mantled in a starless and\r\nimpenetrable blackness, more mysterious and dreadful than the loneliest\r\nwatery abysses from which we had just escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                           On Unknown Shores\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the darkness complete than it seemed to be populated\r\nwith all manner of weird and terrible things. The disappearance of\r\nthe light seemed to be the signal for the approach of a host of evil\r\nmonsters. A chorus of hoarse, unearthly voices, loud as the bellowing\r\nof a bull, resounded about us in a deep, continuous bass; and throaty\r\ngruntings and savage snorts and howlings echoed and droned as though\r\nthey issued from ten thousand pairs of giant lungs. Dazed with horror,\r\nwe stared into the unbroken gloom like doomed men; I had visions of\r\ncolossal eyes smoldering from the blackness, and jaws that struck and\r\ntore, and gnashing teeth that rent and shattered.\r\n\r\nBut it was not a moment before our dumbfounded inaction was over.\r\nPellmell we flung ourselves toward the submarine, almost failing to\r\nfind it in the darkness, and tumbling tumultuously over one another in\r\nour haste to crowd through the narrow door. Several of the men were\r\nshoved accidentally into the water, and Stranahan came in dripping from\r\nan unexpected swim; while the Captain walked with a slight limp, newly\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, we were all safely within the ship, and the doors\r\nwere barred against the unknown peril. Several of the men, still\r\ntrembling with terror, were eager to get under way directly; but this\r\nidea the Captain emphatically vetoed, declaring that the X-111 was no\r\nlonger seaworthy. All that we could do now was to try to locate the\r\ndanger with our searchlights; and accordingly, we wasted no time before\r\nswitching on our powerful lanterns and revolving them in slow circles\r\nthat illumined by turns every inch of the boulder-strewn, weedy plain.\r\nAll in vain. Although the unearthly chorus could be heard even through\r\nthe closed doors and showed no sign of diminishing, our searchlights\r\nrevealed nothing that we had not already seen.\r\n\r\nFor some time we watched and waited--but nothing happened. And at\r\nlength, turning to us all with a smile, the Captain advised, “Well,\r\nboys, we’ve all had a pretty hard time of it. Suppose we just forget\r\nabout that racket out there and try to take a little rest.”\r\n\r\nWe were all glad enough to follow the Captain’s suggestion. Several of\r\nthe men were commissioned to take turns standing watch; and the rest of\r\nus were not long in seeking much needed sleep. Within a few minutes,\r\nthe deep and regular breathing from the nearby bunks informed me that\r\nmy companions had temporarily forgotten the day’s adventures.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, exhausted as I was, I could not so readily find\r\nrelief. The events not only of the past few hours, but of many months,\r\ncame trooping before my mind in continuous blurred procession; I was\r\nobsessed by my own imaginings, and from a dim half-consciousness, I\r\nwould awaken time after time to a vivid re-experiencing of some almost\r\nforgotten episode. And, strangely enough, my reveries were concerned\r\nmainly with a single phase of my life--the phase I was now living. My\r\nyouth and early manhood might almost not have existed, for all that I\r\nremembered of them now; but I did sharply recall how, at the outbreak\r\nof war more than a year ago, I had decided abruptly upon the action\r\nthat had plunged me into my present plight. Resigning my position\r\nat Northeastern University, where I had been serving as instructor\r\nin classic Greek, I had enlisted in the navy, and had promptly been\r\nsent to an officers’ training school, from which I had emerged as\r\nEnsign. Friends had commended me upon my patriotism, yet it was not\r\npatriotism, but rather the greed for adventure, that had motivated my\r\ndecision; and now, as I looked back, it seemed ironic to me that my\r\nprevious uneventful days had been so much more pleasant than any of my\r\nadventures. There was, however, one factor which had served to make\r\nthose days enjoyable, a factor without which even the most active life\r\nwould be barren indeed--and that factor was one which could have no\r\nplace in wartime. Frequently, as I tossed and struggled fitfully on\r\nmy narrow bunk, there flashed before me out of the darkness the blue\r\neyes and laughing face of one whom I could scarcely recall without a\r\npang; and I lived again with Alma Huntley those sparkling days among\r\nthe Vermont hills, when she was to me all that life was, and I won\r\nher promise of devotion among the scented pines and to the music of\r\nrippling waters ... That day was long past, yet how actually it came\r\nback to mind! And how acutely memory brought back a later day, when\r\nher cheeks were moist and I held her in a minute-long embrace, and\r\nmutual vows and soft murmurings were exchanged, and then there came\r\nthe sharpness of “Farewell!” and she was gone, lost amid a blur of\r\nfaces, and I marched sedately on while the world was blotted out in\r\nloneliness and grief ... Oh, why had I left her, plunging thus among\r\nthese unknown horrors?... Fervently, as I lay there listening to the\r\nuncanny bellowings from the ghostly world without, I longed to reach\r\nout my arms to her, to hold her warmly, to speak to her, and to hear\r\nher speak, if only one loved word....\r\n\r\nBut even the most intense yearning may be blotted out by sleep. And\r\nat last, after hours, I lost my memories in unconsciousness--an\r\nintermittent unconsciousness, broken by disturbed dreams and vague\r\nimages of death and disaster....\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes to find a bright, golden light pouring in through the\r\nunshuttered windows. Surprised, I leapt to my feet, and discovered that\r\nthe great mysterious golden orbs were shining as before from far above,\r\nthe boulder-strewn plain glimmered as clearly as at first, the massive\r\ncolumns were still fairy-like in their tints of pale pink and blue,\r\nwhile the hideous bestial noises had unaccountably ceased.\r\n\r\nHastily I dressed and rejoined my companions. I found them gathered\r\nabout in a little circle, earnestly talking; and they welcomed me\r\ngladly into their discussion, the subject of which I at once surmised.\r\nFor what but our mysterious plight could now occupy our minds and\r\ntongues? None of us, as yet, had more than the faintest inkling of\r\nwhere we were or what had befallen us. That we were in some sort of\r\ncavern beneath the sea was the belief of the Captain and several of\r\nthe men, but this region seemed so oddly unlike a cavern that the\r\nexplanation was not generally accepted; and the more superstitious\r\nwere inclined to hold that we had been bewitched into some sort of\r\nsupernatural, goblin realm. For my own part, I could hardly understand\r\nhow we could be in a submarine cavern without being completely flooded;\r\nand much less could I understand how we could be in any known land\r\nabove seas.\r\n\r\nObviously, the only likely source of information was through\r\nexploration. And since it was not possible to conduct any explorations\r\nwith the aid of the disabled X-111, the Captain took the only other\r\navailable course--which was to order some of the men to set forth into\r\nthe Unknown on foot, determine the lay of the land and return as soon\r\nas possible with whatever tidings they might gather.\r\n\r\nStangale and Howlett, being the most experienced veterans, were\r\nselected to make the initial attempt. In a few minutes, they set off\r\ncheerfully together, equipped with firearms and a day’s supply of food\r\nand drink, with instructions to return within twenty-four hours at the\r\nlatest.\r\n\r\nTwelve or fifteen hours went by while we waited impatiently; the great\r\ngolden orbs flashed out as mysteriously as before, and for eight or ten\r\nhours we slept; then, upon awakening, we found the lights still shining\r\nas brightly as ever, and noted that it was time for the return of our\r\ntwo scouts. We watched in vain for their arrival. Not a moving thing\r\ngreeted us from the unchanging, bouldery plain; hours went by; excited\r\nspeculation gave way to more excited speculation, and wild rumor to\r\nstill wilder rumor; the suspense became tantalizing, and yet there was\r\nnothing to do but wait. Had the men lost their way? or had they met\r\nwith some disastrous adventure? or had the savage inhabitants of these\r\nwild realms seized and imprisoned them? To these questions there was\r\nno answer, though many were the conjectures. When the darkness had\r\nfallen upon us once again, and once again we had slept and awakened to\r\nfind the golden light restored, we knew that it was time to set out in\r\nsearch of the missing ones.\r\n\r\nThis time the Captain called for volunteers to invade the Unknown,\r\nwhich, as he warned us, might be dangerous beyond all expectations;\r\nand after half the crew had offered themselves for the adventure, his\r\nchoice fell upon Ripley and Stranahan.\r\n\r\nIt was with genuine regret that I watched these two gallant seamen set\r\nforth amid the reeds by the river’s brink, to disappear at length among\r\nthe boulders and behind the great stone columns. Somehow, as I lost\r\nsight of them, I had a sense that we might not see them again so soon.\r\nI was sad as though with a forewarning of disaster; and, as I reflected\r\nupon the pitfalls and dangers they might have to face, I experienced\r\nmore than one twinge of vicarious fear.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, my misgivings seemed to be justified by time. Twelve\r\nhours passed, and the explorers had not returned; twenty-four hours,\r\nand there was still no word from them, though they had been given\r\nexplicit orders to be back. With grim, set eyes, the Captain stood\r\nalone by the river bank, gazing sternly into that wilderness which\r\nhad already engulfed four of his men; and the rest of the crew stood\r\nchattering fearfully among themselves, declaring that this land was\r\n“haunted,” “spooky,” and “thick with devils.”\r\n\r\nIt was curious to note how, in these weird, unknown domains, outworn\r\nsuperstitions were being reborn; how ready the men were to believe in\r\ngoblins, dragons, sea serpents, werewolves and all manner of fantastic\r\nmonsters. Even the more enlightened of us seemed about to forget all\r\nthat civilization had taught us; and, in the failure of all that we had\r\nbeen accustomed to cling to, we were clutching at a savage, terrorizing\r\nfaith in incredible and ghostly things.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Stranahan and Ripley had been absent forty-eight\r\nhours, the crew was in a state of impatience verging upon madness. The\r\nfluttering of a feather would have sent them scampering like frightened\r\nhorses; the buzzing of a bee might have been the signal for spasms\r\nof dread. On one occasion, indeed, the chirping of some cricket-like\r\ninsect did put half a dozen of the men into a panic; and on another\r\noccasion three or four of them turned pale merely upon hearing the\r\nswishing and flapping of a small fish in the river.\r\n\r\nIt was when the excitement was nearing its highest that the Captain\r\ncalled once more for volunteers to search for the missing men. But\r\nso deep-rooted and paralyzing was the general alarm that only two of\r\nus offered our names--young Phil Rawson and myself. I do not know\r\nwhat strange wave of courage had suddenly emboldened this timorous\r\nrecruit while less callow men held back. For my own part, I must admit\r\nthat I volunteered from the mere desire to escape from ennui and the\r\nhalf-frenzied rabble of my comrades. But, whatever our motives, we were\r\npromptly to be launched into adventures that were not only to test\r\nour hardihood, but to prove interesting beyond anything we could have\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: --and from a narrow focus of flame, two huge burning\r\ngreen eyes would shoot forth, darting cold malice at us through the\r\nglass port.... Or else a tiny flattened disk, softly phosphorescent\r\nthroughout and marked on one surface by two bright beady eyes, would\r\ncome floating in our direction like a pale apparition....]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                         A Tour of Exploration\r\n\r\n\r\nRawson and I had been gone not half an hour when the aspect of the\r\ncountry began suddenly to change. It was as though we had passed some\r\nindistinguishable boundary, for the boulders were rapidly becoming\r\nless numerous, and at length disappeared entirely, while at the same\r\ntime the odd, mossy vegetation became astonishingly rich and profuse.\r\nOr, to be precise, it gave place to a different vegetation entirely,\r\nan unearthly vegetation, almost too strange for belief. At the risk\r\nof being accused of fabrication, I must describe those incredible\r\nplants: the creepers with long leaves of lace-like brown, which twined\r\nin dainty wreaths and veils about the olive-green boles of limbless\r\ntrees, the bushes, shaped like starfishes, and of the hue of dried\r\ngrass, with diaphanous flowers that a breath might have blown away; the\r\ncinnamon-brown reeds that rose to double a man’s height, ending in a\r\nprofusion of cucumber-shaped fruits; the peculiar, abundant growth that\r\nlooked at a distance like a great earthen jar, but proved upon closer\r\nexamination to be the hollow container of a species of milk-white down\r\nthat grew in long and silken strands like untended hair.\r\n\r\nSo dense was the foliage that we would not have been able to force\r\nour way through it, and would not have dared to make the attempt, had\r\nit not been for a sharply cut path which wound in leisurely curves and\r\nundulations close to the river’s brink. It was not like one of those\r\npaths which nature occasionally plans, or which are due to the tracks\r\nof wild beasts, for it had a regularity of design and an evenness of\r\nwidth that proved it to be unmistakably the work of man. Yet what man\r\ncould have penetrated before us into these uncanny sunless depths? At\r\nthe mere thought that others might have preceded us we involuntarily\r\nshuddered; we were half convinced that we were intruders into a tomb\r\nclosed ages ago. But despite this conviction, we kept a constant,\r\nhalf-terrified outlook for sign of human presence.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before our vigilance was rewarded. Abruptly the path\r\nbefore us widened, until it was of the size of a broad highway; and\r\nabove the dense masses of vegetation, we beheld in astonishment the\r\nlooming marble pillars of a Grecian colonnade. Toward this the road\r\nled in long and graceful curves; and it was but a few minutes before\r\nwe found ourselves at the entrance of a covered walk or “stoa” that\r\nbrought back to me vivid memories of “the glory that was Greece.” On\r\nboth sides of us the palely-tinted Ionic columns rose to a majestic\r\nheight, daintily ornamented at the base with the acanthus design, and\r\ncurving in symmetrical proportions that brought to mind the perfection\r\nof the Parthenon; while the marble floor on which we walked and the\r\nmarble ceiling above us were frescoed with figures that seemed drawn\r\nbodily from the romance of the ancient world. They were not wholly\r\nGreek. I knew these pictures of sportive mermaids and lightning-hurling\r\ngods and dragon-slaying heroes and misty caves of twilight and the\r\nthrobbing lyre; but there was something suggestively Greek about them\r\nall; and steeped as I was in the lore of ancient Hellas, I had the\r\nsingular feeling that the hand of time had been turned backward two\r\nthousand years or more.\r\n\r\nThis feeling was accentuated when, having followed the covered walk\r\nfor a distance of several hundred yards, I observed that it led to a\r\nmagnificent, many-columned edifice which could pass for nothing if not\r\nfor a temple of the ancient gods. It was a structure of solid marble,\r\nwhite marble artistically varied with veilings of black; its pillars\r\nwere massive as the trunks of the giant redwoods I had seen in the\r\nCalifornia forests years before, and like those redwoods, produced an\r\neffect of solemnity and awe; but all was so perfectly designed and\r\nproportioned that, while the building occupied an area perhaps as large\r\nas the average city block, it gave an effect less of magnitude than of\r\nartistic completeness and beauty. No living thing was visible about\r\nthe precincts of this amazing temple, nor would I have expected any\r\nliving thing in what I had come subconsciously to regard as a realm of\r\nthe dead; but I was overawed at thought of this abandoned loveliness,\r\nand paused at some distance to regard it reflectively, mentally asking\r\nwhether it was some still undiscovered survival from classical times or\r\nwhether I was but seeing a vision.\r\n\r\nA suppressed exclamation from young Rawson brought me back to\r\nreality--or, at least, to the unbelievable thing that passed for\r\nreality. In the very center of the swift-rolling river, the banks\r\nof which paralleled the colonnade at a distance of a dozen paces,\r\nI observed a low-lying, gliding form, gracefully elevated at both\r\nextremes, which at the first terrified glimpse I took to be some\r\nfabulous monster, but which I soon recognized as some sort of boat or\r\ncanoe. Before I had had time for a half-composed glance at it, it had\r\ngone speeding out of view; but in its fast-moving frame, I thought I\r\ncould distinguish half a dozen dusky bobbing shapes, and half a dozen\r\npairs of oars that reached out rhythmically, and noiselessly clove\r\nthe dark waters. Later, when I had had time for reflection, I was to\r\nrecognize this strange craft as akin to the shadowy apparition, the\r\nunknown sea monster which had so terrified us in the submarine; but at\r\npresent I was overwhelmed by the knowledge that this weird place was\r\nactually peopled, peopled by living men whom at any moment we might\r\nmeet face to face!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely recovered from this surprise when an even greater\r\nsurprise flashed upon us. Out of the windows of the temple, which we\r\nhad believed long closed to human sound, a strange, thin music began\r\nto float, serenely beautiful and of elfin remoteness and charm....\r\nAnd while, entranced, we listened to those magical strains, there\r\ncame the fluttering of a butterfly gown, and from the temple doors\r\nissued a shimmering, dancing form, followed by a score of other\r\ndancing, shimmering forms--scarcely human, we believed, so ethereal\r\ndid they seem in the flashing and waving of arms, the swift rhythm\r\nof feet, and the play and interplay of pale blue and gold and pink\r\nand lavender and white from their flowing and multi-colored robes. A\r\nsingular iridescence seemed to overspread them, almost a halo such as\r\nmay envisage a goddess; and, gaping and enthralled, we gazed on them\r\nas men might gaze on Venus were she to return to earth. Now down the\r\nlong colonnade they started, tripping toward us with birdlike gestures\r\nand the airy unreality of perfect time and movement; and, fearful to\r\ndisturb the vision by our gross presence, we hid ourselves behind the\r\ngreat stone columns, peeping out furtively as though they might vanish\r\nbubble-like at our gaze. But, apparently absorbed in their dance, they\r\ncontinued gracefully toward us, not glancing to right or to left, and\r\ncatching no hint of our intrusion--until, as the procession drew more\r\nnear and the charm of the music more compelling, I peered out too\r\nincautiously from behind my marble bulwark, and found myself staring\r\nfull into the face of the most ravishingly beautiful woman I had\r\never beheld. There was a quality about her face that seemed to mark\r\nit as not of the earth, the Madonnas of old paintings have something\r\nof that look; and the most perfect womanly bust that sculptor has\r\never conceived; but there was also a vividness and an animation that\r\nno mere painting or statue has ever shared, together with an air of\r\nsuch innocence, such candor and kindliness of soul that, had I been a\r\nbeliever in angels, I might have gone down straightway upon my knees.\r\n\r\nBut all this I beheld in the space between two heartbeats. Even as\r\nthe vision greeted me it vanished; the beautiful clear eyes were\r\ndistended with terror upon their first contact with mine; there came a\r\nscream of fright, followed by a chorus of screams; then a scurrying of\r\nfast-retreating feet, and the bright, fairy-like shapes had vanished;\r\nand the empty river flowed silently past the empty colonnade and temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                          The Mysterious City\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few hours showed us a continuous amazing panorama. The\r\nmarble temple proved to be but one of a series connected by long and\r\ngraceful colonnades; and in the central structures, the Ionic and\r\nDoric architecture were curiously mingled with a type that seemed\r\nscarcely Grecian at all, since it admitted of all variety of arches and\r\ncurves unknown to the builders of classical Hellas. Most remarkable\r\nof all, perhaps, were the gorgeously ornamented vases--some of them\r\nsix or eight feet in height--which were of a style akin to those\r\nexcavated from the ruins of old Ilium. But what caught my eye even more\r\nstrikingly were the statues that occasionally appeared in niches along\r\nthe marble galleries or in alcoves of the temples--statues that would\r\nsurely not have been unworthy of a Praxiteles, since even Praxiteles\r\ncould not have surpassed the symmetry of form and the unstrained\r\nreality of pose and expression with which these unknown artists had\r\ndepicted their wrestling heroes and dancing fauns and stern-browed\r\nold men and queenly maidens and gracious youths. For one who had been\r\nnurtured on modern art, these busts and marbles were as old paintings\r\nwould be to him who had known only sketches in black and white; there\r\nwas none of that snowy coldness or bronze severity of hue which are so\r\ncommon in sculpture today, but all of the statues had been skilfully\r\ntinted with the complexion of life, and such was the verisimilitude,\r\nthat several times I started in surprise on beholding what I took to\r\nbe a living man but which proved to be only an image of stone. I was\r\ninterested, moreover, to note that none of the sculptured features had\r\nthat peculiar hardness and selfish keenness so common among the men\r\nI had known, but that all seemed suffused with a clear and tranquil\r\nspirituality; and every lyric impulse within me was awakened when I\r\nobserved on many of the faces of the women that same unearthly Madonna\r\nlook which had graced the butterfly-gowned dancing maiden.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, Rawson and I did not allow our pleasure in the\r\nstatuary to keep our minds from more vital subjects. Above all, we\r\nmaintained a constant lookout for the inhabitants of these queer\r\nregions, for we could no longer suppress the suspicion that unseen\r\nfurtive eyes were peeping out at us from behind every pillar and\r\nwall. For my own part, I had more than one qualm that I did not care\r\nto admit, and secretly wished myself back on the X-111; and as for\r\nRawson--I found that youth afflicted with far too much imagination for\r\nan adventurer, and repeatedly begged him to keep his fantastic fears to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut there was no repressing the excitable young Rawson. When he was\r\nnot drawing pictures of the serpents and wild beasts that probably\r\ninfested the thickets beside the temples, he would be diverting me with\r\nthe most grewsome ghost stories I had ever heard; and he went so far\r\nas to suggest that the dancing girls had been only airy apparitions,\r\nwhile the brilliant golden lights above us had no more reality than a\r\nwill-o’-the-wisp. Evidently he had been too much nurtured on fiction\r\nof the blood-and-terror variety, for only a devotee of the most hectic\r\nadventure tales could have imagined, as he did, that our pathway was\r\nbeset with robbers’ lairs, pirates’ dens, scorpions and crocodiles,\r\nhead-hunting cannibals, siren women luring us to destruction, and\r\nmurderous desperadoes of a thousand ilks and guilds.\r\n\r\nFortunately for my peace of mind, I heard not half of Rawson’s ravings,\r\nfor my interest in the wayside architecture served as a distraction.\r\nFor two or three hours I was occupied with inspecting the gracefully\r\nconnecting galleries of five or six temples; and, having passed the\r\nlast of the group, I was absorbed in my observations of a long, marble\r\ncolonnade which extended apparently for miles in a straight line amid\r\nthe gray and brown fantastic vegetation.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was that I made the most startling discovery of the day.\r\nAt intervals along the floor of the colonnade, which was of a red\r\nand yellow mosaic of baked and hardened clay, appeared deeply-graven\r\ninscriptions which I paused eagerly to survey. At first I thought\r\nthat they were in no known language, but it was not long before I had\r\ndetected a certain resemblance between the characters and those of\r\nthe ancient Greek. Profiting from my collegiate study of that tongue,\r\nI puzzled over the words while Rawson stood by impatiently urging me\r\nto be off; and one by one I succeeded in identifying the letters with\r\nthose of the Greek alphabet! Not every one of the characters, it is\r\ntrue, could be recognized with assurance, but enough of them were\r\nunmistakably Greek to give me a clue to the whole; and at length I\r\nfound myself making a translation that might solve the entire mystery\r\nof this extraordinary land.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the process was a slow and plodding one, and I did not make the\r\nprogress I had expected. Even though the letters were clear enough,\r\nthe meaning of the words was not. Evidently this was not the Greek\r\nof Plato or Thucydides, in which I had been thoroughly schooled; but\r\nrather it was a language that was to classical Greek what Chaucer is\r\nto modern English. Still, I was not completely discouraged, for I did\r\nmanage to make out an occasional word, though not at first enough to\r\ngive meaning to any passage. All in all, considering the limited time\r\nat my disposal, my efforts seemed futile; and I was about to yield to\r\nRawson’s importunities and give up this diverting study for further\r\nexploration, when suddenly I made a successful discovery. I must have\r\ncome upon a passage simpler than the rest, for unexpectedly half a\r\nsentence flashed upon me with clear-cut meaning at once so striking and\r\nso enigmatical that I stopped short with a little cry of surprise.\r\n\r\n“Placed here in the year Three Thousand of the Submergence,” ran\r\nthe words, which occurred in large lettering at the base of a statue\r\nof a strong man trampling down the ruins of what looked like a steel\r\nbuilding. “Placed here ...” at this point were several words that I\r\ncould not make out--“in celebration of the Good Destruction.”\r\n\r\n“In celebration of the Good Destruction!” I repeated, after translating\r\nthe words aloud. “Sounds as if written by a madman!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe you didn’t read it right,” commented Rawson.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion, of course, I ignored. “Wonder what the Submergence can\r\nmean,” I continued, meditatively. “That doesn’t seem to make sense,\r\neither.”\r\n\r\n“No, it doesn’t,” Rawson admitted, with a thoughtful drawl. “Everything\r\ndown here seems sort of topsy-turvy. Suppose we go on and see what else\r\nwe can find out.”\r\n\r\nI nodded a hesitating assent, and we proceeded on our way in silence.\r\nBut, though we did not speak, our thoughts were active indeed, for\r\nmore than ever I was convinced that somehow, unaccountably, we were\r\namid the remains of a Grecian or pre-Grecian countryside. Had Socrates\r\nor the radiant Phobus himself stepped out of the grave to greet me, I\r\nwould not have been surprised; and I more than half expected to catch a\r\nglimpse of Athena’s robe from behind the dark shrubbery, or to see the\r\nwinged feet of Hermes or hear the clear notes of Pan.\r\n\r\nBut neither Pan nor Hermes nor any of their famed kindred presented\r\nthemselves upon the scene. And after walking at a good pace for more\r\nthan an hour along the marble colonnade, I forgot those interesting\r\nindividuals in contemplation of a scene that left me gaping in greater\r\nastonishment than if I had invaded a council of the high Olympian gods.\r\nFor some minutes a series of huge templed domes and columns, dimly\r\nvisible through rifts in the vegetation, had attracted my attention and\r\naroused Rawson’s misgivings; but neither of us had had any intimation\r\nof the sight that was to greet us when at length we came to the end of\r\nthe colonnade.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we saw a clay road sloping down sharply beneath us, and\r\nfound ourselves gazing out over a valley more dazzling than we had\r\never before known or imagined. Through its center flowed the great\r\nriver, with gentle loops and twinings; above us, as before, reached\r\nthe dark-green sky illumined with the golden suns; and an innumerable\r\nmultitude of palely tinted columns, like the tree trunks of some\r\ncolossal forest, shot upward to that sky as though to support it. But\r\nwhat were truly remarkable were the buildings that adorned the plain.\r\nOn both sides of the river they stretched, far to the distance and out\r\nof sight, palaces of white marble and of black marble, of jade and of\r\nalabaster, some with an elegant symmetry of Greek columns, some with\r\na solidity of masonry that seemed half Egyptian, some with an almost\r\nOriental profusion of spires and turrets, of porticoes and balconies\r\nand arches and domes. But all alike were reared in perfect taste, and\r\nwith perfect regard to the style of their neighbors; all alike faced\r\non wide avenues, flowery lanes or lawny and statue-dotted parks; all\r\nappeared but parts of a single design which, when seen from above, was\r\nlike some consummate tapestry patterned by a master artist.\r\n\r\nAs Rawson and I stood staring at this matchless scene, I suddenly\r\nrecalled the steeples and towers of that city we had seen beneath us in\r\nthe submarine. A strange similarity in the outlines of the buildings\r\nimpressed itself upon me--then in a flash it came to me that the two\r\ncities were one and the same! And at that instant I shuddered, amazed\r\nand horrified at the abrupt solution of the mystery ... It was as the\r\nCaptain had suggested; we were indeed beneath the ocean, thousands\r\nof feet beneath the ocean, in some cavern inexplicably spared from\r\nthe waters and haunted by the ghosts and relics of some ancient and\r\nvanished race!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                        The Temple of the Stars\r\n\r\n\r\nFar from echoing the agitation I felt, Rawson seemed actually pleased\r\nat the turn of events. It piqued his imagination to think that we\r\nshould be so far beneath the sea; and he conjured up all manner of\r\nalluring possibilities that testified more to his youth than to his\r\ncommon sense. He suggested that we were the discoverers of a great\r\nand magnificent empire which we should explore, conquer and then\r\nannex to the United States; and he formed his plans regardless of\r\nthe probability that we should never see the United States again,\r\nand almost as though there were regular transportation facilities\r\nto the upper world. The sheer scientific difficulties--the apparent\r\nimpossibility that a cavern free from water could exist beneath the\r\nocean, the even more striking impossibility that human beings could\r\ninhabit such a cavern--seemed to make little impression upon the\r\nillogical mind of Rawson; and he was convinced that only by the rarest\r\ngood fortune had we been entombed in these fantastic and dream-like\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nSo intense was his enthusiasm, that he urged me to descend at once with\r\nhim to the many-templed city. But I did not willingly accede; I pointed\r\nout that it would be wiser to hasten back to the submarine, inform\r\nCaptain Gavison of what we had seen, and return here--if we returned at\r\nall--in greater numbers than at present. Besides, as I reminded Rawson,\r\nthe Captain had ordered us back within twenty-four hours; and, if we\r\ndallied, some mischance might delay us until too late.\r\n\r\nHad Rawson but had a dim prevision of the black hours ahead, he would\r\ncertainly have accepted my suggestions. But, perversely enough, he\r\nseemed to be almost without his usual fears just when those fears might\r\nhave proved most useful. And since of course I could not allow myself\r\nto be outdone in bravery by a mere boy, I had to signify a grudging\r\nassent to his proposal. I must confess, however, that my motives were\r\nnot unmixed, for pictures of the iridescent dancing girl kept flitting\r\nbefore my mind and would give me no peace; and I may have had hopes (I\r\nwill not say that I did) of meeting her again in this city of fountains\r\nand palaces.\r\n\r\nBut not a living creature could be seen stirring in the avenues of that\r\nstrange town as Rawson and I began our slow descent. Once or twice we\r\nthought we saw the glimmer of a light or the flash of some moving thing\r\nin the far distance, but we could not be sure; and the silence and the\r\nimmobility gave the general effect of a city of the dead. There was\r\nsomething ghostly about that calm, still atmosphere, something that\r\nmight have made me turn back in alarm had it not been for the presence\r\nof Rawson; but there was also something soothingly peaceful, a charmed\r\nquiet that brought to mind the fairy tales I had heard in childhood,\r\nand in particular that enchanted palace where the Sleeping Beauty had\r\nslumbered for a hundred years. Here, I thought, one might dream away\r\na hundred years or a thousand, and never know that time had passed at\r\nall; here, conceivably, the ancient world might lapse into the modern,\r\nand the modern into the far future without apparent change.\r\n\r\nMy reveries were interrupted by our arrival at the gates of the city.\r\nWe passed beneath a high arch almost Roman in style, with marble base\r\nand facade ornamented with strange blue sea-shells; then, proceeding\r\nalong a winding cement walk inlaid with mother-of-pearl, we approached\r\nthe most stately palace of all. In architecture, it was totally\r\ndissimilar to anything we had ever before observed: although perhaps\r\nfive hundred feet in length, it was as much like a great statue as\r\nlike a building; it had none of those features common in edifices for\r\nthe shelter of man and his works, but seemed to have been erected\r\nexclusively as a piece of art. Its form was that of a woman, a woman\r\nreclining at full length, her breast to the ground, her head slightly\r\nelevated, propped meditatively upon her palm; and the structure as\r\na whole had been planned with such subtlety and skill, with such\r\nconsummate attention to every detail of the woman’s position, form and\r\ngarments and to the beatific and yet lifelike expression of the face,\r\nthat Rawson and I could only pause in bewildered silence and stare and\r\nstare as though this work had been created through no human agency but\r\nby some superhuman master hand.\r\n\r\nIn that first spellbound moment, it did not occur to us that there\r\nmight be an entrance to the palace. But at length, where a lock of\r\nthe woman’s dark, sculptured hair fell across her breast, we noted a\r\nlittle doorway so skilfully concealed that it had originally escaped\r\nour attention. Since the gate swung wide upon the hinges, curiosity,\r\nof course, prompted us to glance within--and with results that proved\r\nbut a further spur to curiosity. All that we could see was a pale,\r\ngolden glitter against a background of black; but imagination supplied\r\nthat which our physical sight could not reveal, and we had visions of\r\ngorgeous halls and corridors which we longed to inspect.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHad our courage been sufficient, we would have entered at once. The\r\nidea, in fact, came to both of us simultaneously, but at first neither\r\nof us could summon up the requisite boldness. There seemed to be\r\nsomething mysteriously, almost irresistibly, attractive about that\r\ntwinkling darkness, something that held us fascinated and forbade us to\r\nleave; and for several minutes we stood hesitating, and straining our\r\neyes, yet making no motion to invade the unknown.\r\n\r\nThen, when the suspense had become so protracted as to be ridiculous,\r\nRawson surprised me by exclaiming, suddenly, “I’m not afraid!” And at\r\nthe same time he slapped his sides energetically as though to prove\r\nto himself that he had no fears. “I’m going right in!” he announced,\r\nwith what I thought to be unnecessary loudness. And, feeling for\r\nhis revolver with a hand that trembled perceptibly, Rawson strode\r\nresolutely into the building.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for me to do but follow. But, somehow, I could not\r\nhelp wishing that my friend had not been so rash; and, somehow, I\r\nforesaw that we might not be able to leave this strange edifice so\r\neasily as we had entered.\r\n\r\nBut, once within, we forgot our misgivings in contemplation of\r\nthe magnificent scene around us. I had been in luxurious galleries\r\nbefore; I had seen the most ornate salons of the Old World, and the\r\nmost lavishly bedecked of mosques and cathedrals; but never had I\r\nviewed or imagined so utterly sublime a hall. Here was a new art of\r\nthe interior decorator, an art that seemed wholly without parallel in\r\nhuman experience; I was scarcely conscious that I was indoors, but\r\nrather felt myself to be in the open, in the open at night, under\r\nthe wide and glittering heavens, with the light of innumerable stars\r\nabove me, and the dim cloudy arch of the Milky Way. How the artist had\r\nproduced his effect was more than I could say, but somehow, in his\r\nlimited space, he had given the impression of vastness and distance,\r\nof the mystery and infinite silence of the starlight; and as I stood\r\nthere entranced, I could almost imagine that I was back again on\r\nearth, gazing out into the night-skies as I had gazed so often from\r\nthe Vermont hills with Alma Huntley.... And yet, perfectly patterned\r\nas they were, these skies were not the skies I had known. As I stood\r\nthere watching, I became aware that certain of the constellations were\r\nslightly, almost indistinguishably out of position, the stars not quite\r\nin their proper relations to one another--and why this was, I could\r\nnot attempt to say. But more striking was another alteration that had\r\nbeen wrought deliberately and with subtle artistry: above the stars,\r\nand about the thin girdle of the Milky Way, were filmy formations of\r\nlight, which--perhaps it was only my imagination--gradually resolved\r\nthemselves into tenuous human figures. One, an exquisitely graceful\r\nwoman, seemed to be playing upon some lyre-like instrument; another,\r\na youth with head uplifted as though in enraptured contemplation,\r\nimpressed me as the spirit of all human aspiration; and still others,\r\nno less consummately outlined, appeared to represent the hopes and\r\nloves and immortal yearnings of man.\r\n\r\nBut while I remained rooted there in ecstatic contemplation, filled\r\nwith wonder at the paradox of beholding the stars thousands of\r\nfeet beneath the sea, there occurred one of those changes by which\r\noccasionally a beautiful dream becomes distorted into a nightmare.\r\nImagine the consternation of one who, while gazing at the cloudless\r\nnight-skies, finds blackness suddenly sweeping all about him--a\r\nblackness that has quenched the stars as a storm might quench a candle\r\nflame. Such consternation was ours, and even greater horror, for\r\nwithout so much as a flicker of warning, the lights of the seeming\r\nheavens flashed out, and darkness stretched above us and all about\r\nus, a darkness so all-consuming that not even a shadow remained. With\r\nhalf-suppressed cries of terror, Rawson and I turned to one another,\r\neach totally invisible in the blank night; and before we had had time\r\nfor coherent speech, there came a rattling and a slamming from behind\r\nus, and we knew that the one possible exit had been closed and that we\r\nwere prisoners in this unknown place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                                Trapped\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment we were like rats newly trapped. All trace of reason\r\nleft us in our sudden furious terror; we began to scurry blindly to\r\nand fro, to and fro in the darkness, panic-stricken in our frenzy to\r\nescape. Where we were dashing we did not know, nor whether we might not\r\nbe rushing into greater peril still; we collided more than once with\r\nthe unseen walls, stumbled over invisible objects on the floor, and\r\nwent fumbling about in long loops and circles--but all to no avail.\r\nThe marvel is not that we accomplished nothing, but that we did not\r\nbreak our necks, for so utterly fear-maddened were we that it was\r\nminutes before we had any thought of ceasing our mad perambulations and\r\nconsidering our predicament calmly and rationally.\r\n\r\nIf I can judge aright from my confused memories of those terrible\r\nmoments, it was the sound of a heavy body falling that shocked me\r\nback to my senses. The fall, which was thudding and resonant, was\r\naccompanied by a suppressed oath, which seemed to issue from far to my\r\nrear, but which none the less sounded familiar.\r\n\r\n“Rawson!” I cried, stopping short, and forgetting caution in my alarm.\r\n“Are you hurt?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not hurt,” came the drawled reply, as though from a tremendous\r\ndistance. And then, after a groan, “No, I’m all right.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you?” I yelled back. “How can I get to you?”\r\n\r\nRawson shouted directions, and I went groping toward him. The process\r\nwas by no means easy, for I was guided wholly by the senses of touch\r\nand hearing, and more than once I came into painful contact with some\r\nunforeseen obstacle. But after some minutes I found myself grasping a\r\nsolid, yielding mass which I recognized as the arm of my friend.\r\n\r\nRawson was as glad as I of our reunion. Somehow, now that we were\r\ntogether again, we both felt much stronger and the unknown foe seemed\r\nless redoubtable. Yet that foe seemed terrible enough as we sat there\r\non the floor conversing in whispers. Although we had regained some\r\nslight composure, the falling of a pin might have sent us off into\r\nconvulsions; and our imaginations were busy painting grotesque and\r\nshadowy horrors.\r\n\r\n“What can it mean?” murmured Rawson, as he sat with his hand upon my\r\nknee, as though to reassure himself by the mere physical fact of my\r\npresence. “What do you think it can mean?”\r\n\r\nI declined to venture any direct reply, although suggestions\r\nsufficiently dreadful were piling up in my brain.\r\n\r\n“Remember how Stranahan and the others were lost,” continued Rawson,\r\nsolemnly, as if the explanation of their disappearance were now\r\nself-evident.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what that has to do with us,” I argued. And then, with a\r\nforced attempt at bravado, “Don’t worry, Rawson. Chances are everything\r\nwill turn out all right.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” conceded Rawson, in a tone indicating that he rather\r\nwished things would turn out badly. And, by way of fanning my\r\ncourage, he entertained me with the most ghastly stories he could\r\nimagine--stories of men trapped in coal mines, men lost in labyrinthine\r\ncaves, men entombed in deep pits or immured in lightless dungeons. To\r\nall these tales I listened with growing uneasiness, meanwhile racking\r\nmy mind to remember a parallel to our own predicament. But I could\r\nthink of nothing that even remotely resembled it; and, having nothing\r\nto say, I answered Rawson only in monosyllables.\r\n\r\nPerhaps owing to the terseness of my replies--or perhaps because of the\r\nterror of our plight--his loquacious mood soon deserted him. It was\r\nnot long before we had lapsed into silence; and it was minutes before\r\neither of us spoke again. Meantime the darkness was so intense, the\r\nsilence so complete and the stillness so absolute that I was persecuted\r\nwith all manner of fantastic fears. What unknown horrors were brewing\r\nin these serene depths? What grotesque or malevolent or even murderous\r\nthings? In my anxiety, I peopled the gloom with monstrous shapes of\r\na thousand varieties, with slimy, crawling serpents, with lithe,\r\ncrouching panthers, with great apes, whose brawny arms could strangle a\r\nman, and--worst of all--with slinking, barbarous humans that crept up\r\nslyly to seize and stab one in the dark.\r\n\r\nBy degrees my imaginings were becoming so grewsome that I could\r\nno longer endure them. And, merely to find relief from myself, I\r\nwhispered, “Come, Rawson, it’s senseless to sit here doing nothing.\r\nMaybe we can find some exit, if only we look carefully enough. What do\r\nyou say? Shall we try anyhow?”\r\n\r\n“I say it’s a good idea,” assented Rawson, rising cautiously to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWithout a word I followed his example, and for the next half hour we\r\ngroped laboriously along the walls, which we found to be of an ice-cold\r\nstone, as smooth as polished marble, absolutely perpendicular and\r\napparently without a flaw or break. Our movements were slow and even\r\nagonizing, for the blackness was still unbroken, and in that hushed,\r\nmysterious place, the slightest sound would send sharp tremors running\r\ndown our spines. Even the grating of our own echoes against the floor\r\nseemed to take on a sinister, uncanny meaning; the whispered tones of\r\nour own voices seemed unhallowed and ghostly; while the occasional\r\nrapping of our fists against the walls or our clattering contact with\r\nsome unseen obstacle sent the echoes ringing and reverberating with\r\nunearthly, hollow notes until our overwrought nerves quivered at the\r\nrustling of our clothing or at the sound of our own breath.\r\n\r\nPossibly two or three times we encircled that great hall--in the\r\ndarkness it was impossible to tell where our starting place had\r\nbeen--but we could find no indication of any passageway or door. And\r\nat length, exhausted by the strain, we crouched on the floor near the\r\nwall and waited miserably for something to happen. Almost anything that\r\ncould have happened--no matter how grim and terrible--would have been\r\na relief; but the quiet was undisturbed, while we sat tense and alert,\r\nwith fast-throbbing hearts, and eyes that searched and searched the\r\ngloom in vain. Neither of us spoke now; and the garrulous Rawson seemed\r\nwrapped up in his own dismal thoughts. How long a period passed thus I\r\ncannot say; my watch may have recorded whole hours, but certainly my\r\nthoughts recorded whole years, for I have lived years that knew less of\r\nsuspense, uneasiness and dread.\r\n\r\nBut at last, after endless waiting, relief came with disconcerting\r\nsuddenness. As though by the turning of an electric switch, a\r\ndazzlingly brilliant light flashed into view above us--a light that\r\ncontrasted strangely with the stars of some hours before, and that\r\nshone blindingly in a pale blue field like the sun in the cloudless\r\nheavens. Then, while we stood shading our eyes from the glaring\r\nillumination, we observed just opposite us, the gate through which we\r\nhad doubtless entered. And with surprise we noted that it moved slowly\r\nupon its hinges; that slowly and as if by magic it made clear the way\r\nof escape!\r\n\r\n“The place is enchanted!” muttered Rawson, in dazed fascination. “Come,\r\nlet’s get out of here!”\r\n\r\nBut when, overjoyed at our rescue, we started toward the gate, an\r\nunexpected obstacle intruded. Half a dozen of the queerest beings\r\nwe had ever seen came crowding into our path--tall, butterfly-like\r\ncreatures with faces almost waxen pale and long capes and robes of pink\r\nand blue and lavender and yellow pastel tints. All had long, flowing\r\nlight red or golden hair which reached at least to the shoulders; one,\r\napparently the oldest, wore an ample beard, but the majority were\r\nsmooth shaven; none had headgear of any type, and all were shod with\r\nsandals covered with green moss, above which for several inches the\r\nunclothed legs were visible. From the blank, amazed stares with which\r\nthey greeted us, it was evident that our appearance was as much a\r\nsurprise to them as theirs was to us. But from a certain sternness and\r\nresolution which invested their faces following the first speechless\r\nastonishment, we concluded that they had probably seen others of our\r\nkind, and were not disposed to treat us leniently.\r\n\r\nWe noted also that, though quivering with dread, they kept the exit\r\nfirmly blocked. And in the long, staring silence that ensued, we felt\r\nin dismay that at last we had met the masters of this strange land; and\r\nwith sinking hearts we realized that our chances of escape had vanished.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ... We all looked up. The ceiling was bulging inches\r\ndownward, as though the terrific pressure of the waters were already\r\nbursting the tough steel envelope of the X-111.]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                           Sapphire and Amber\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may have been no more than thirty seconds before the silence was\r\nbroken, though it felt like many, many minutes. But at length one of\r\nthe newcomers, turning to his companions, the while keeping his eyes\r\nstill fastened upon us, began to speak in low, rhythmic tones that\r\nwere singularly musical and pleasant. I could catch not one syllable\r\nof what he said, though I strained my ears in the attempt; nor could\r\nI understand any syllable of what his fellows spoke in reply, though\r\ntheir voices too were so soft and sweet-sounding that they might have\r\nbeen intoning poetry. Yet, in spite of the gentleness of their voices,\r\nI could detect a certain excitement in their manner; and, from their\r\ncasual nods and gestures in our direction, I was only too certain of\r\nthe theme of their discussion.\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes of whispered conversation, one of the strangers\r\nstepped toward us and raised his voice as if addressing us. As might\r\nhave been foretold, I understood nothing of what he said; and, as this\r\nwas no doubt what he expected, he did not look surprised, but after a\r\nmoment ceased speaking and motioned us to follow him.\r\n\r\nSince there was manifestly nothing else to do, we obeyed readily\r\nenough, and were glad indeed to find ourselves stepping once more\r\nthrough the doorway and out into the street, even though the half\r\ndozen strangers had grouped themselves on all sides of us as a sort of\r\nbodyguard. We knew, in fact, that we were virtually prisoners, and yet\r\nwere no longer alarmed, for no imprisonment could be worse than that\r\nwhich we had already suffered. Also we had an intuitive sense that\r\nwe should not be badly treated; whether out of consideration for our\r\nfeelings or merely because they were afraid of us, our attendants did\r\nnot attempt to lay hands on us or to coerce us in any way. Yet when\r\nthey indicated by gestures the direction in which they desired us to\r\nwalk, we had no thought of objecting, but obeyed as docilely as though\r\nthey were our acknowledged masters.\r\n\r\nFor a distance of possibly two or three miles they led us with them\r\nthrough the city streets; and far from brooding over our predicament\r\n(which was manifestly serious), we amused ourselves with observing the\r\nsights of the town. Dozens of the inhabitants had come out to peer at\r\nus as we strode past; and, though they kept at a cautious distance, we\r\ncould see them clearly enough: their slender, graceful forms and blond\r\nfeatures, their amiable blue eyes and rippling, unbound hair, their\r\nloose-hanging, light-tinted robes, variously colored from buff and\r\nlilac to azure and pale rose, gave them the appearance less of human\r\nbeings than of walking butterflies or flowers.\r\n\r\nBut even more interesting to us than these humans was the architecture\r\nof the town. We were fascinated, first of all, by the very pavement\r\nbeneath us, which was of baked clay worked into a multihued and\r\npicturesque mosaic; we were still more fascinated by the buildings,\r\nwhich on close observation proved to be even more artistically designed\r\nthan we had imagined, for exquisite little statues abounded in\r\nniches between the columns or under the domes and spires, and superb\r\nfrescoes decorated the ceilings of the numberless colonnades and the\r\noutside walls of temples, and curving walks wound gracefully between\r\nterraces adorned with a lovely waxen flower or around the brink of\r\nthe shimmering rainbowed fountains. I particularly noted the width\r\nof the avenues, in whose spacious reaches and wide adjoining courts\r\nthe bright-robed children laughed and played; and I was surprised to\r\nobserve that the buildings, instead of being jammed together in the\r\nmodern box-like fashion, were each separated from their neighbors by\r\nbroad paved ways or wide patches of vegetation, so that the whole gave\r\nan uncrowded and leisurely and yet skilfully patterned effect.\r\n\r\nBut magnificent as were the edifices in their garb of sandstone or\r\ngranite or many-hued marble, the most extraordinary by far was that\r\nto which our guides ultimately led us. It was not the size of the\r\nstructure that distinguished it, since the city boasted far larger\r\nbuildings, and size in itself did not seem to have been an object\r\nwith the builders; but the quality of the masonry and the style of\r\nthe workmanship had surely no parallel in human experience. For the\r\nwalls and the interior circles of columns were not of any material\r\never employed before, not of steel or of stone, of brick or of clay,\r\nor gold or of ebony; they were of a translucent yellow hue, the hue of\r\namber, and seemed to be composed, if not actually of amber, at least\r\nof glass tinted amber color. This, however, was scarcely the most\r\nremarkable fact, for the floor was likewise translucent, and shone with\r\nan entrancing blue, the blue of sapphire; and sapphire seemed also the\r\nsubstance of the fretted and vaulted ceiling, from which hung images\r\nof great birds with wide-spread wings, giving a startling illusion of\r\nflight. Three successive circles of columns, each more massive than the\r\nlast and all adorned at the base with bas-reliefs of strange fishes and\r\nstranger sea plants, supported the great arching expanse of the roof;\r\nand completely enclosed by the columns, on a steep and curving incline\r\nof the sapphire floor, were row after row of amber seats grouped in a\r\nhalf circle about a flat open space, and forming--so it seemed to me--a\r\nGrecian theatre of unique design.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Rawson and I accompanied our guides into this queer building, we\r\nwere so captivated by the architecture and so enthralled by the silence\r\nand the weird half-light of sapphire and amber that we did not at first\r\nobserve that other human beings had preceded us into the place. It was\r\nlong, indeed, before we could recover from the awed sense of entering\r\nsome cathedral where all is reverential and unworldly; and it was long\r\nbefore, turning our eyes upon the theatre with its rows and rows of\r\nseats, we observed that not all the chairs were vacant as we had at\r\nfirst assumed. In the front tiers sat perhaps a hundred light-gowned\r\nindividuals whose sedate and earnest faces proclaimed that they were\r\nconvened for some solemn purpose.\r\n\r\nOur arrival was greeted by a sudden murmuring of low, musical voices,\r\nbut by nothing more demonstrative; and our presence was doubtless\r\nexplained by our attendants, who spoke a few words to the assembled\r\ngroup, after which they took seats to one side and motioned us to do\r\nlikewise. We obeyed readily enough, but as I crossed the room to take\r\nmy designated place, I received a sudden shock, an electrical shock of\r\npleasure, such as one experiences upon meeting a friend unexpectedly\r\nin a strange city. In the foremost row, staring up at me with a most\r\ncurious and kindly air, sat that enchanting woman whom I had seen\r\ndancing along the colonnades! As a sober and practical man, and one\r\nalready in love with the gracious Alma Huntley, I should no doubt have\r\nregarded her with a wholly aloof and impersonal air; but I was sadly\r\nimpressionable, alas! and was almost transfixed with joy at sight of\r\nthose shining Madonna features and clear magnetic, great blue eyes.\r\nFor an instant, indeed, I actually stopped short in my tracks, until,\r\nregaining my presence of mind, I hastened toward my seat shamefaced at\r\nhaving so betrayed myself. It was several minutes before I ventured\r\nagain to glance toward the fair one, and then she was looking in an\r\nopposite direction; and, stare at her as I might, she seemed totally\r\noblivious of my existence.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that, in the ensuing hour, my thoughts were more on her\r\nthan on proceedings in the theatre. I was aware, indeed, that some sort\r\nof debate was in progress, a discussion in which most of the spectators\r\ntook part and during which Rawson and I were more than once pointed\r\nout with significant gestures. But, since I could understand not one\r\nword of what was spoken, I let my imagination travel to the beautiful\r\nunknown, and tried to fancy how it would feel to be befriended by so\r\nfairy-like a creature. Even to speak a word with her, I thought, would\r\nbe a delight, and to hold a conversation with her would be the rarest\r\nof good fortune. Of course, her face might belie her character, and she\r\nmight be unintelligent as she was beautiful; yet I was convinced that a\r\nrare soul shone out of the calm seductive depths of her eyes, and was\r\nmore than willing to believe that she combined the wisdom of a Socrates\r\nwith the charms of an Aphrodite.\r\n\r\nSo pleasantly was I occupied in contemplating this fascinating being\r\nand her scarcely less fascinating fellows, that it seemed but a\r\nmoment before the debate was over and the assembled men and women\r\nrose from their seats and began to depart. With a start I sprang to\r\nmy feet, suddenly realizing that the assemblage had perhaps reached\r\nsome critical decision regarding me. And when four or five of the men\r\napproached Rawson and myself and motioned us away, I had the feeling\r\nof a captive being led back into imprisonment. The loveliest of all\r\nwomen had now been lost to view amid the crowd, and I was sadder at\r\nher disappearance than at thought of my personal sufferings; but as I\r\nwalked slowly out of that sapphire and amber palace, gentle strains\r\nof music began to play on unseen instruments, rippling delightedly as\r\nwaves on a calm sea; and gradually and insensibly I was comforted,\r\nand somehow I was convinced that I should see that glorious womanly\r\napparition again.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce more we were escorted through the city streets, but this time had\r\nonly a few hundred yards to walk. After a minute or two we were led up\r\nthe steps of a many-columned marble mansion, and into a long hall whose\r\nstained glass windows cast a subdued illumination upon a score of vivid\r\npaintings. We were wondering what to do, when our guides motioned us\r\nto cushioned seats that seemed made of woven seaweed; and after we had\r\nsettled ourselves at ease in the great sofa-like chairs, two of the\r\nmen disappeared momentarily and returned with a feast of some singular\r\nsubstance reminding me of mushrooms flavored with a sprinkling of\r\nhoney. At first we were suspicious and reluctant to eat; but the honest\r\nand frankly puzzled faces of our hosts convinced us of our folly; and\r\nwe found the dish, while strange to our palates, not only appetizing\r\nbut invigorating after our long fast.\r\n\r\nAfter we had eaten and the remains of the meal had been borne away, we\r\nwere treated to a still greater surprise. A man came stalking in laden\r\nwith five or six variously colored cloths, which I recognized as the\r\nnative costumes; and, having spread these out before us, he motioned us\r\nto discard our own clothing and take our choice of the local apparel.\r\nOur attendants then politely withdrew, leaving us more perplexed than\r\never.\r\n\r\nBut it was long before we could make up our minds to array ourselves\r\nin the native garb. And while we stood hesitating, casting occasional\r\ndisdainful glances at the colored garments before making the decision\r\nwhich we knew we ultimately must make, our attention was distracted\r\nby the paintings that adorned the walls. Although all were executed\r\nwith the deft and flawless hand of a master, they were in a sense\r\ndifferent from any paintings I had ever seen before; and what struck\r\nme in particular was not so much their peculiar style of art, which\r\ncombined a minute realism with an almost cosmic suggestiveness, as\r\ntheir arresting and unparalleled subject-matter. Half of them were\r\nof a marine type, and depicted ocean caves where the giant squid or\r\noctopus wavered through the gray depths, or gardens of the ocean floor\r\nwhere the many-branching coral was the playground for shimmering blue\r\nand yellow fishes; the other half, and the most remarkable by far,\r\nportrayed scenes of ruin and destruction on a scale that might have\r\nstaggered the most daring imagination. One of them, for example,\r\npictured a city with slender skyscrapers not unlike those of modern New\r\nYork, but all the skyscrapers were crumpled and toppling as though from\r\nsome titanic blast; another, which likewise represented a many-spired\r\ncity, showed the ocean rolling up in one colossal wave and battering\r\nand washing away the buildings as a rain storm may wash away a child’s\r\nsand castles; while a third, and by all odds the most ghastly of the\r\ngroup, depicted a sea bottom strewn with the wreckage of great stone\r\nedifices, in whose vacant towers and windows and among whose shattered\r\ncourts the sword-fish and the eel sported and slunk and the fanged\r\nshark pursued its prey.\r\n\r\n“Strange!” I remarked to Rawson. “What peculiarly morbid people is this\r\nthat its artists should delight in scenes of flood and ruin? Or is it\r\nthat its painters are striving to represent some actual disaster, some\r\noverwhelming ancient catastrophe unheard of on earth?”\r\n\r\nHoping to find an answer to these questions, I strained my eyes\r\nover the inscriptions that marked each picture--inscriptions in the\r\nnear-Greek characters I had already tried to decipher. As before, I\r\nhad at first no success in translation; but, having nothing else to\r\ndo, I persevered; and once again I ended by construing two or three\r\nwords--words that left me only more deeply mystified. “After the\r\nSubmergence,” was the legend that explained the picture of the ruined\r\ntown at the sea bottom; and, noting how closely this phrase resembled\r\nthose I had previously interpreted, I was forced to conclude that “The\r\nSubmergence” was indeed some definite historical event. But when it had\r\noccurred or how was still a question as unanswerable as though it had\r\nconcerned the planet Mars.\r\n\r\n“It is possible that we will never be able to solve the problem.” I\r\nwas observing to Rawson, when suddenly I heard that which made me stop\r\nshort in amazement, momentarily forgetting all about tidal waves and\r\nsunken cities.\r\n\r\n“Saints in heaven, that’s a good one! That’s the time I put one over\r\non you, boys!” came to me in indistinct tones, accompanied by a loud\r\nguffaw; and Rawson and I stared at one another in astonishment,\r\nbewildered as men who have seen a ghost.\r\n\r\n“Stranahan!” we cried in one voice; and the tears were ready to flow at\r\nthe thought that we had found our lost companion.\r\n\r\nA moment later, having made our way through a columned hallway into an\r\nadjoining room, we were met by the strangest sight we had yet seen in\r\nthis land of many wonders.\r\n\r\nSprawled haphazard on the floor, absorbed in the distribution of a\r\npack of cards, were our four lost fellow seamen, all of them looking\r\ngrotesque indeed in their colored native garments, and Stranahan\r\nappearing particularly outlandish in his gown of pale green, his\r\ntrouser legs showing from beneath, his blue sailor’s blouse conspicuous\r\nthrough the open neck in front!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                        The Will of the Masters\r\n\r\n\r\n“Lord have mercy on me, if it ain’t Harkness! And Rawson, too!” cried\r\nStranahan, leaping to his feet, and seizing our hands in a hearty grip.\r\n“By all things holy, I thought I’d never see you again!”\r\n\r\nFor a moment we were unable to reply, so great was the confusion of\r\nshouts, greetings, and excited questionings from our four new-found\r\ncompanions. Though we were fully as delighted as they, our first words\r\ncame in inchoate, mumbled phrases, for our surprise was apparently even\r\ngreater than theirs.\r\n\r\n“Well, and what are you doing in this part of the country?” Stranahan\r\nat length inquired, with a smile. “I thought you were safe in the old\r\nX-111.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is safe in the X-111,” I replied. “Captain Gavison sent us out\r\nafter you when you didn’t come back.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry to hear that,” declared Stranahan, ruefully. “You know I\r\nhate to disobey orders, but I’m afraid I’ll have to. We won’t be coming\r\nback just yet.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think that?” I demanded, with sudden misgivings.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it--I know it,” he maintained, with an air of certainty.\r\nAnd, leaning on one foot against a marble column while his brawny hand\r\nstroked his chin, he continued, ruminatingly, “Suffering sea snakes, do\r\nyou take me for a fool? Do you think I’d be here if I could find a way\r\nout?”\r\n\r\n“But can’t you?” I questioned, innocently.\r\n\r\n“No, by the devil, I can’t!” he swore. “Neither can you! We’re all\r\nprisoners here!”\r\n\r\n“What? Prisoners in this building?” I gasped.\r\n\r\n“No, not in this building! In this town!” corrected Stranahan.\r\n\r\n“In this town?” Despite my agitation, I began to laugh. “This town\r\nmakes a fair-sized jail.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t think so for long!” warned Stranahan, with all the fury of\r\nconviction. “The Lord strike my heart from my breast if I ever saw a\r\ndeader place--except maybe my own home town on Sunday afternoons!”\r\n\r\nFollowing this outburst, Stranahan recounted his recent experiences,\r\nwhich were not altogether different from our own. Like us, he and\r\nRipley had reached the city following an ambling excursion among the\r\noutlying colonnades and temples; but unlike us, they had not been so\r\nunfortunate as to be trapped in one of the buildings. In fact, they\r\nhad suffered a different misfortune entirely. Upon entering the city,\r\nthey had been confronted by several of the natives; and, surmising that\r\nthese strange beings were hostilely disposed, the terrified Stranahan\r\nhad whipped out his revolver and fired toward the crowd. So far as was\r\nknown, no one had been injured, but all had been badly frightened by\r\nthe report; and for a while, the two seamen had had the freedom of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThey were ultimately stopped, however, by a band of determined-looking\r\nnatives. Though apparently unarmed, and though they used no violence,\r\nthese men overpowered the intruders in some inexplicable way. Not only\r\nwere Stranahan and Ripley deprived of their pistols, but they were\r\nrendered docile as children, and were conducted, as we had been, to the\r\nplace of amber and sapphire, where a hundred pale-robed individuals\r\ndebated and passed on their fate. Next they were brought to their\r\npresent dwelling, where they were clothed and fed, and where they were\r\nreunited with Stangale and Howlett, who had preceded them to the city.\r\nThey had now been living here for several days, and during that time\r\nhad been treated with unexpected civility and kindness and even allowed\r\nto roam at will through the city; but whenever they had approached\r\nthe boundaries of the town, they had encountered a band of citizens\r\nwho, by shouts and gestures and a mysterious but irresistible power of\r\nsuggestion, had given them to understand that they were not to leave.\r\n\r\nStranahan was approaching the end of his recital, and was telling\r\nus how he had been compelled to wear the native costume and how his\r\nmeals had been brought to him regularly twice each day, when he was\r\ninterrupted by the entrance of several natives, who had been looking\r\nfor us in the adjoining room and seemed a little annoyed at our\r\ndisappearance. Unceremoniously they led us back to the other apartment,\r\nwhere the half dozen robes were lying in wait for us; and, perceiving\r\nfrom their gestures that we would do well to don the native garb,\r\nI promptly arrayed myself in a gown of pale lavender, while Rawson\r\nexchanged his sailor’s suit for a costume of daintiest yellow. Both of\r\nus had difficulty in adjusting the garments, which were fastened at the\r\nshoulder by a fish-bone device resembling a safety-pin; and we had our\r\nhesitation about the sandals, which were slipped on at a stroke and\r\nyet were held firmly in place by inconspicuous cords. But though we\r\npuzzled over our new apparel for many minutes, Rawson found in the end\r\nthat he had his on inside out, while the front of mine was where the\r\nrear should have been. Of course, we did not discover these mistakes\r\nfor ourselves. Our attendants, on returning to see us fully attired,\r\nindicated the errors with smiles and suppressed laughter; and with\r\ntheir aid, we managed to array ourselves almost like self-respecting\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortunately, we had little time just then to notice how ridiculous\r\nwe looked in our colored gowns. As soon as the perplexing business\r\nof dressing was settled, one of the men motioned me to a sofa in a\r\ncorner of the room, where he took a seat beside me as though for some\r\nimportant purpose; and a second similarly led Rawson to an opposite\r\ncorner, while the other natives unceremoniously took their leave. My\r\nparticular attendant, who was a tall man, neither young nor old, with\r\nclassic features and keen but kindly gray eyes peering from beneath\r\na wide expanse of forehead, now began to go through a series of\r\napparently meaningless gestures, accompanied by no less meaningless\r\nwords. First he would tap his head while emitting a peculiar sound;\r\nthen he would tap his breast while emitting another peculiar sound;\r\nthen he would touch his arm, his knee, his foot, always slowly and\r\ncarefully pronouncing one or two unintelligible syllables. In the\r\nbeginning, I was inclined to wonder whether he was not mad, but this\r\nview was not furthered by the discovery that Rawson’s attendant\r\nwas conducting a similar performance. It was doubtless only my own\r\nstupidity that prevented me from grasping the truth immediately. At\r\nlength my companion drew a small pad of paper from his pocket and began\r\nto write upon it with an instrument resembling a fountain pen, and\r\nI understood clearly enough then that he was trying to teach me his\r\nlanguage; so I gave him my undivided attention, noting carefully each\r\nobject he touched and the corresponding sounds, and noted particularly\r\nthe characters he jotted down upon the paper.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I saw light amid the darkness! Although this was but my\r\nfirst lesson, I was making faster progress than either of us could have\r\nanticipated--my knowledge of ancient Greek was proving invaluable!\r\nAt the first glance, I observed the resemblance between the letters\r\nmy instructor was inditing and those of the old Greek, even as I had\r\nnoticed the resemblance on the stone inscriptions; and it was not many\r\nminutes before I discovered that some of the words, although not to be\r\nrecognized when pronounced, were written in a style closely similar to\r\nthe Greek, and were obviously built upon Greek roots. This was not true\r\nof all the words, but it was true of such a large percentage, that I\r\nhad hopes of soon being able to speak the language and so to solve the\r\nmystery of this fantastic deep-sea people.\r\n\r\nAfter about two hours, my instructor rose from his seat, shoved the pad\r\nof paper back into his pocket, and indicated that our lessons were over\r\nfor the day. But he smiled upon me graciously, as though to indicate\r\nthat I was a not unpromising pupil; and he spoke a word which I thought\r\nI recognized as “Tomorrow,” after which he saluted me with a courteous\r\nwave of the hand, and joining Rawson’s instructor, went ambling\r\nleisurely out of view.\r\n\r\nIt was with a wry smile that Rawson rejoined me. “Say, did you get\r\nanything out of it at all?” he inquired. “I just couldn’t make head or\r\ntail of it. Heavens, at this rate it would take me ten years to learn\r\nmy A, B, C’s!”\r\n\r\nI did not confide that I had private reasons for feeling more\r\noptimistic than my friend. But, after I had offered to help and was\r\nrejected, I was content to let the conversation drift to other subjects.\r\n\r\nRawson was now annoyingly given to useless lamentations. Hotly he\r\ndeplored our plight; he declared that he no longer saw anything\r\nromantic about it, and least of all perceived anything romantic about\r\nbeing made to go to school again; and he reminded me time after time\r\nof Captain Gavison and the crew, whom we had last seen stranded in the\r\nwilderness with the disabled X-111, and who were no doubt awaiting\r\nour return in hope that was fast giving way to despair. Though I did\r\nnot share in Rawson’s dislike of our present quarters, and though I\r\nwas deterred from leaving, not only by hopes of learning the language\r\nbut by thoughts of the nameless fair one, yet I had to listen when\r\nRawson spoke of our duty to our waiting comrades; and, in spite of\r\nthe forbidding precedent set by Stranahan and Ripley, I could not but\r\nconsent to try to return to our shipmates.\r\n\r\nAs the doors of our dwelling were wide open and there was no one to\r\ninterfere with us, we sauntered forthwith into the streets. As usual,\r\nwe found them almost deserted, and so had no hesitation in proceeding\r\nalong the winding walks and broad avenues and past the innumerable\r\nterraces, courts and temples in the direction from which we had entered\r\nthe city. As the various distinctive gardens and palaces constituted\r\nunmistakable landmarks, we were seldom at a loss as to our route, and\r\nin little more than half an hour we found ourselves at the threshold\r\nof the town, before that odd statue-like edifice where we had been\r\nimprisoned. The path of escape now seemed open, and our flight appeared\r\nso easy that we paused momentarily, almost with misgivings at having\r\nencountered no obstacles. But not a person was in sight, and no sign of\r\nany impediment was visible, and so in surprise we started up that slope\r\nwhich led to the colonnades and outlying temples.\r\n\r\nWe had almost reached the top, and I was already deep in regrets at\r\nleaving this charming city just as it was becoming so interesting,\r\nwhen half a score of pale-gowned individuals suddenly appeared from\r\nabove the ridge, their vociferous cries and commanding gestures warning\r\nus back. They carried no weapon, yet they could not have been more\r\nimperious had they borne loaded rifles; there seemed almost to be some\r\nhidden compulsion, some irresistible magnetism about them, so that our\r\nweak wills quailed and bowed to theirs, and we retreated before them\r\nas impulsively as a singed animal retreats before fire. I do not know\r\nwhy it was, for they surely would not have set violent hands upon us;\r\nbut we no more thought of disobeying them than a trained dog thinks of\r\ndisobeying its master; and back to the city we hastened, while they\r\nfollowed on our heels with faces stern and set; and, having re-entered\r\nthe town, we made our way directly to the building we had just left,\r\nas though some superior mind controlled our movements and we were no\r\nlonger free.\r\n\r\nUpon our return, we met with another surprise. Naturally, we were\r\nprompted to seek Stranahan and our three other shipmates again; but we\r\nhad expected that they would be occupied, as before, by cards or some\r\nother time-killing game. Instead, we found them seated in the four\r\ncorners of the room, each with a companion (needless to say, a native);\r\nand from the peculiar gestures of those companions and their habit of\r\nwriting occasionally on pads of paper, we recognized that they were\r\ngiving instructions in the language of the land. But this in itself\r\nwas not the surprising fact. Two of the four newcomers were ladies,\r\none of them being of matronly years; but the other, who sat opposite\r\nStranahan, smilingly making notes with her pen, was not only in the\r\nfull bloom of youth, but had that singularly sweet cast of countenance,\r\nthose singularly clear and magnetic large blue eyes, which could belong\r\nto only one woman in the world!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ... Beneath us, at a distance that may have been five\r\nhundred feet and may have been a thousand, the vaults and domes and\r\ncolumns of innumerable stone edifices shone palely and with sallow\r\nluster. Surely, we thought, this was some unheard-of Athens, doomed\r\nlong ago by tidal wave or volcano ... Palace after magnificent palace,\r\nmany seemingly modelled by architects of old Greece, went gliding by\r\nbeneath us; countless statues, tall as the buildings, pointed up at us\r\nwith hands that were uncannily life-like; wide avenue after wide avenue\r\nflashed by, and one or two colossal theatres of Grecian design ...]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                              Discoveries\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat as was my joy upon observing that the entrancing mysterious\r\nlady was Stranahan’s tutor, it was to be some time before her daily\r\nproximity had any effect upon my life. And meanwhile I was resigning\r\nmyself to a regular routine, a routine only partly of my own choosing,\r\nand largely prescribed by those whom I had come to consider my masters.\r\nEach night (and by night I mean the period of eight or ten hours when\r\nthe golden orbs were quenched and the city was in total blackness)\r\nI would sleep with Rawson and Stranahan on screened open-air rooms\r\non the roof. And each day I would live almost as though by formula.\r\nAroused by the burst of light that marked the queer underworld dawn,\r\nI would take a plunge in a salt-water swimming pool in a court of\r\nour apartment. A few minutes later I would join my companions in a\r\nrepast of some fragile little native cakes and of some queer fruit\r\nlike a cross between the apricot and peach, which were brought to us\r\nregularly by well-laden carriers whom I observed likewise supplying\r\nneighboring houses. Breakfast over, we were free for a while; and then\r\nI would usually go rambling about the city with Rawson or Stranahan, or\r\nsometimes with all my five former shipmates; and we would have a merry\r\ntime laughing and chatting, inspecting the various palaces, colonnades\r\nand gardens, and poking fun at any object that happened to strike us as\r\ncurious or absurd.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or two we would return to our apartments, to await the\r\narrival of our tutors, who had a habit of appearing in a band of six\r\n(one for each of us) sometime toward the end of the morning. Stranahan\r\nwas still the most fortunate of us all, since for many weeks his tutor\r\ncontinued to be that woman of the Madonna features and magnetic large\r\nblue eyes; but the rest of us were also fortunate in a way, for she\r\nwould always beam upon us with bright “Good morning” in the native\r\ntongue; and I personally had hopes that the time was not far-off when\r\nwe should be better acquainted.\r\n\r\nAt the end of perhaps two hours, the tutors would leave for the day;\r\nbut they would always provide us with ample work in the shape of simple\r\nexercises to be written or of passages to be deciphered in textbooks of\r\nthe kind evidently used for six-year-olds. This “home-work” (as Rawson\r\ndesignated it) would keep us busy until late in the afternoon, when a\r\nnative would arrive with a tray containing various savory viands: a\r\ngray bread made from a grain with a flavor like walnuts; a succulent\r\nvegetable like French toast well browned; a spiced, starchy food\r\nreminding me vaguely of baked potatoes; cakes of a hundred varieties,\r\nand fruits shaped like tomatoes and tasting like muscat grapes, or\r\nelongated like cucumbers and flavored as oranges, or round and large\r\nas cantaloupes and substantial as bananas. But while we were of course\r\ndelighted at the abundance of these appetizing unfamiliar foods, we\r\nwere not a little surprised--and not a little disappointed--at the\r\nabsence of much that we would once have considered essential; and we\r\nconstantly wondered why it was that no meat nor fish nor any other\r\nanimal product found its place on the bill of fare.\r\n\r\nAfter this meal (the second and last for the day) we were once more\r\nfree to do as we wished; and we would ordinarily spend the time until\r\ndark in strolling around the city, or in sitting about in a little\r\ncircle exchanging anecdotes, or in propounding theories as to where we\r\nwere and how we had arrived, or in playing cards or any other little\r\ngame that we could devise. Except for our tutors, we came into contact\r\nwith none of the natives; we were too ignorant of the language to speak\r\nwith the occasional few whom we passed on the streets; and as yet we\r\nknew virtually nothing of how they lived.\r\n\r\nBut we were much less concerned about the natives than about our\r\ncomrades of the X-111. We were still restrained in the city by the\r\nmysterious, irresistible power of compulsion exercised by our hosts;\r\nand though the days were lengthening into weeks, no word of Captain\r\nGavison and our absent shipmates had reached us. For all that we could\r\nsay, they might have perished of starvation or fallen through a black\r\nhole in the ground--or, more plausibly, they might have been discovered\r\nby the natives, and led as captives to lodgings miles away. Should we\r\nsee them soon, or at least have news of them? or should we never learn\r\nwhat had befallen them? There was no way to decide except to wait--and\r\nthe process of waiting was distressingly slow.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut I was secretly determined to do everything possible to hasten\r\nevents. Obviously, the first necessity was to understand the native\r\nlanguage--hence I put forth every effort to learn to read and write.\r\nLess because of my natural linguistic tendencies than because of my\r\nacquaintance with ancient Greek, I was making more rapid progress\r\nthan any of my fellows, and was acquiring the rudiments of a speaking\r\nand reading knowledge. Not only did my own ears tell me so, but my\r\ninstructor admitted as much by his occasional nods of approval, and\r\nnow and then even by a “Very Good” or “Excellent” when I was speaking\r\nor reciting to him. But not content with my normal rate of advance,\r\nI was fortifying myself with much secret practice. Often I would\r\nrefrain from joining my comrades in their morning and evening strolls\r\nand pastimes, and would remain quietly in my room with a pad of paper\r\nand a pencil supplied me by my tutor. I would devote hours to writing\r\nin the native alphabet, until I could employ it with facility and\r\nassurance; or I would jot down a list of words and phrases and repeat\r\nthem aloud time after time, trying to imitate the peculiar accentuation\r\nof my instructor. The latter task in particular was difficult and even\r\npainful, and subjected me more than once to ridicule, when Stranahan\r\nor the others entered the room unexpectedly and found me apparently\r\ntalking to myself. But I persisted in spite of discouragements, and\r\nhad hopes that, instead of commanding but a few scattered words and\r\nphrases, I would shortly be able to conduct an extended conversation.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural, however, that I should be able to read the\r\nlanguage before I could speak it. Not more than two or three weeks\r\nhad passed before I felt capable of deciphering any average native\r\ndocument. But, unfortunately, I had little opportunity to practice my\r\ntalents, for the only written material I saw was in the shape of the\r\nsimple exercise books lent me by my instructor. These, while admirably\r\nadapted for clarifying grammatical problems, were entirely devoid of\r\nvital information; and when I asked my instructor for more edifying\r\nworks, I did not seem able to make him understand, for what he brought\r\nme was merely a more advanced exercise book.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I had every reason to be grateful for that chance which\r\nput me in possession of several volumes designed for adult readers. For\r\nlack of better occupation, Rawson and I were minutely inspecting our\r\napartments one afternoon, scrutinizing in particular the picturesque\r\npatterns of the veined marble walls, when suddenly I stopped short with\r\na cry of surprise, startled at sight of a little rectangle faintly\r\nalthough unmistakably engraved in otherwise unbroken surface of the\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nPromptly I informed Rawson of my discovery. He shared in my surprise,\r\nand excitedly suggested that this was some mysterious trap-door.\r\n\r\nAlthough I saw no reason to agree with him, I approached the\r\nrectangular patch to examine it more closely, and in so doing rested my\r\nhand appraisingly on the marble surface.\r\n\r\nTo my utter amazement, a portion of the wall gave way, swinging inward\r\nas if on noiseless hinges!\r\n\r\nBut if Rawson had had visions of secret corridors and darkened\r\nchambers, he was to be disappointed. The displaced rectangle revealed\r\nnot a mysterious passageway, but a little closet or vault possibly\r\nthree feet deep--a vault filled to the brim with treasure! At least, it\r\nwas filled with what I regarded as treasure, for within it were piled\r\nscores of books!\r\n\r\nHastily I reached for the nearest volume--a heavy tome bound in what\r\nI took to be a sort of artificial leather. The title filled me with\r\nrejoicing: it was a “Lexicon of the More Commonly Used Words.”\r\n\r\nAided by the bewildered Rawson, I at once examined the entire\r\ncollection. Although he could decipher not a word, Rawson feigned the\r\nprofoundest interest; and, indeed, he may well have been interested,\r\nfor, as I read and translated the titles, I was making discovery after\r\nextraordinary discovery. Not that any of the books were those works\r\nof sheer information which I most desired, but that they all embodied\r\nsignificant hints and clues. Some, like the inscriptions I had observed\r\namong the colonnades, seemed to refer to some great disaster, as in\r\nthe case of one entitled, “Artistic Progress Since the Destruction”;\r\nanother, which was called “Speculations Concerning the Supermarine\r\nWorld,” fortified my impression of being in some inexplicably buried\r\nland; while several were treatises on such difficult subjects as\r\n“Intra-Atomic Engineering,” “Marine Valves and Their Construction,” and\r\n“The Creation of Artificial Sunlight.”\r\n\r\nBut the book that caused me the greatest surprise--a book that struck\r\nme as at once a priceless find and an insoluble mystery--was the\r\nwell-thumbed yellowing little volume at the very bottom of the heap.\r\nEven today, when all that passed in those enigmatic realms is an old\r\nand oft-repeated story, I have difficulty in repressing my astonishment\r\nat that discovery. Imagine the bewilderment of one who, having voyaged\r\nto another world, suddenly receives news of familiar things, and at the\r\nsame time learns unsuspected facts about the familiar! Imagine this,\r\nand you will have only a vague notion of the amazement I felt when,\r\nturning the pages of the book in that unknown cavernland, I recognized\r\nthe name of--Homer!\r\n\r\nAnd not only did I recognize the name of Homer, but I found it affixed\r\nto a work not previously catalogued among the productions of the great\r\nAttic bard! “Telegonus” was the title--and instantly I recalled that\r\nthere had been a legend among post-Homeric writers of one Telegonus,\r\nthe son of Odysseus and Circe, who had been sent by his enchantress\r\nmother in search of his father, and had slain his sire without\r\nrealizing his identity.\r\n\r\nOne may be sure that I wasted no time about plunging into the book.\r\nOne may be sure that I took no heed of the surprised exclamations of\r\nRawson, nor even paused for more than a word of explanation, but read\r\nand read as fast as my knowledge of the language would permit. Truly,\r\nthe poem was Homeric in quality!--I recognized at once the swing of\r\nthe inimitable hexameter, handled with masterly craftsmanship; and the\r\nopening passages, executed with epic dash and sweep, simplicity and\r\npower, convinced me that here was a work worthy of standing side by\r\nside with “The Iliad” and “The Odyssey.”\r\n\r\nBut how came the poem to be here in this weird undersea realm? How\r\ncame these submerged people to possess an Homeric work unknown to the\r\nmodern world? These were the questions that perplexed me as I excitedly\r\nfollowed stanza after noble stanza; and ponder the problem as I might,\r\ndebate it as I would with myself or the eager Rawson, I could conceive\r\nof no explanation, but was as mystified as if I had traveled to Mars\r\nand found the people addressing me in English or presenting me with\r\ncopies of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                         Questions and Answers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief effect of the discovery of the books was to make me doubly\r\nanxious to speak the native tongue. Not one of the score of volumes\r\ncast any light on the problems that bewildered me, and least of all\r\non the mystery of Homer’s “Telegonus”; and it was apparent that I\r\nshould remain in ignorance until I could converse with the natives.\r\nAccordingly, I had need of that rarest of all qualities, a virtue in\r\nwhich I am almost wholly lacking--patience. Stifling my eagerness\r\nand curiosity as best I could, I had to plod away for days and days\r\nin acquiring new native words and phrases and in practicing speaking\r\nin the solitude of my own rooms. The task was far from pleasant, and\r\nthe suspense and the waiting were harrying; but I was like a traveler\r\nfollowing a trail through an unfamiliar jungle; and, feverish as I was\r\nto escape, I had no choice except to persist on the one visible course.\r\n\r\nBut had I not been so eager to batter down the mystery, I would have\r\nfound abundant cause for encouragement. I was still progressing,\r\nprogressing rapidly, attaining a speaking knowledge of the language\r\nwith a speed possible only for one long trained as a linguist. And,\r\nas the result of many a secret conversation, which I held with myself\r\nby way of practice, I advanced swiftly to the point of being able to\r\nexchange ideas with the natives. At least, I felt that I had advanced\r\nto that point, and awaited only opportunity to test my new-won powers.\r\n\r\nThe obvious course would have been to address myself to my tutor, and\r\nseveral times I was on the point of doing so, but on each occasion he\r\nseemed so absorbed in the day’s exercises, that I decided to postpone\r\nthe experiment. In the end, however, I should no doubt have opened my\r\nmind to him--had not chance intervened and sent me a more charming\r\ninformant.\r\n\r\nI had of course not forgotten that entrancing Madonna-like woman who\r\nwas Stranahan’s tutor. Indeed, I could not easily have forgotten\r\nher, for her exquisite features and bright eyes kept flashing before\r\nme at all hours of the day and night; and already I felt myself as\r\ncompletely subject to her spell as Dante to the spell of a Beatrice.\r\nUnder the witchery of her influence, Alma Huntley was becoming no more\r\nthan the figment of a remote and misty past--and yet I was not even\r\nacquainted with the fair unknown, I had never exchanged more than a\r\nformal greeting with her. I scarcely knew how to sow the seeds even for\r\na casual friendship, and what she was like at heart and how she would\r\nreact to my advances, were matters of pure conjecture.\r\n\r\nBut the time was to come when she would be more to me than one to be\r\nadmired at a distance. She was, in fact, to serve in a double rôle: for\r\nnot only was she to fascinate me with her companionship, but she was to\r\ncast light upon those problems which were tantalizing me.\r\n\r\nAlthough I caught glimpses of her almost every morning when she came\r\nas Stranahan’s instructor, yet I would have had little chance to speak\r\nwith her even had I chosen, since (as I have already related) she\r\nordinarily arrived and left in the company of the other tutors. But one\r\nday--perhaps because she had some particularly difficult bit of grammar\r\nto explain--she lingered over her work much longer than usual, and was\r\nso absorbed in it that she did not appear to notice that her fellow\r\nteachers had left. At the moment I did not perceive that this was my\r\nopportunity; but good fortune was to be with me, and when she emerged\r\nfrom the marble doors of our home, I happened to be strolling along the\r\ncolonnade not a hundred yards away.\r\n\r\nAt first it was almost a shock to me to see her come unaccompanied\r\ntoward me--a shock in which intense pleasure was mingled with something\r\nakin to dread. For a moment I had an impulse to hide behind one of the\r\ngreat stone columns; fortunately, I thrust this foolish desire from me,\r\nand, after a few seconds, had almost regained my composure.\r\n\r\nAs she approached, I could scarcely take my gaze from her. Upon her\r\nface was a serene, placid expression, such as she almost always wore;\r\nbut the shadow of a smile flickered about her lips, and her great blue\r\neyes were withdrawn as if they saw not the world wherein she walked but\r\nonly some calm and perfect inner vision.\r\n\r\nSlowly I advanced; and diffidently placed myself in her path. At first\r\nshe did not seem to see me, but in an instant, almost as though she\r\nhad been expecting some one, her gaze was lifted to meet mine; and\r\nno surprise was marked there, nor any trace of annoyance, only an\r\nunlooked-for pleasure. In low, musical tones, and with grace that to me\r\nseemed goddess-like, she murmured “Good morning,” while such a lovely\r\nand unmatched light shone in her eyes and such transfiguring inner\r\nradiance illumined her features, that I felt that I had encountered an\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” I replied, in the native dialect, and at the cost\r\nof greater effort than I would have cared to admit; and I shuddered\r\ninwardly lest I give her cause for laughter.\r\n\r\nShe smiled charmingly, and was about to pass on, when in desperation I\r\nstrove to detain her. “I beg your pardon,” said I, stiffly, speaking\r\nalmost by rote in phrases I had memorized days before. “I beg your\r\npardon, but have you a minute to spare? There are one or two questions\r\nI should like very much to ask you.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor an instant she stared at me in transparent surprise. But a smile\r\nplayed lightly about the corners of her mouth, and apparently she was\r\nnot offended. “Why, of course, you may ask any question you want,” she\r\nreplied, more puzzled than annoyed. And, pointing down the colonnade\r\nto a circular marble bench enclosed by a ring of slender columns, she\r\ncontinued, “Let us go over there. Then we can talk, if you wish.”\r\n\r\nIn silence we traversed the intervening two or three hundred yards. My\r\nheart was so full that I could not have spoken had I desired; I could\r\nscarcely credit my double good fortune in having won this lady’s good\r\nwill and in speaking well enough to be understood by her.\r\n\r\nAnd when at length I found myself seated at her side, her vivid blue\r\neyes looking inquiringly and yet kindly into my own, I felt as one\r\nwho enters the land of dreams come true. It was with difficulty that\r\nI answered when, in low, sweet tones, she asked me what it was that I\r\ndesired to know; and when the first words came to me, they were forced\r\nout only by an effort of the will, for I should much have preferred to\r\nsit there in silence, staring and staring at her animated lovely face,\r\nher sharp-cut classic profile and symmetrically modelled features.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the laws of human intercourse demanded that\r\nI do more than gaze at her in speechless rapture. And I answered\r\nher question, therefore, with one or two commonplace remarks which\r\nexpressed nothing of the exaltation within me, and which could have\r\nconveyed no high opinion of my intelligence. “I am a stranger in this\r\nland,” said I, picking my words with a translator’s care, “and so\r\nfind many things here which perplex me. I was wondering whether you\r\nwould not be good enough to help me. Am I imposing too much upon your\r\nkindness?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, of course not,” she murmured; and as she spoke I noted that\r\nher upper lip trembled slightly, as though from extreme sensitiveness\r\nand sympathy. “Do you not know that it would be a pleasure to be of\r\naid?”\r\n\r\nI was enchanted by this reply, for there could be no doubting the utter\r\ncandor and sincerity in her earnest blue eyes, which were glowing with\r\na softness equal to the magnetism they sometimes displayed.\r\n\r\nEncouraged to the point of boldness, I decided upon a daring step.\r\n“Before I ask any other question,” I ventured, “might it not be well\r\nfor us to know each other’s names?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course,” she agreed. “My name is Aelios.”\r\n\r\n“Aelios!” I repeated, charmed by the sound. “What a delightful name!\r\nAnd what is your other name, may I ask?”\r\n\r\n“My other name?” she echoed, astonished. “What other name do you mean?”\r\n\r\nI saw that somehow I had made a mistake. “Why, haven’t you another\r\nname?” I inquired, with distinct loss of confidence.\r\n\r\n“Another name?” She tittered delightedly, as though enjoying a rare\r\njoke. “Well, if that isn’t the most outlandish idea! What do you think\r\nI’d do with another name?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that--that’s not for me to say,” I stammered. “Only, where I come\r\nfrom, every one has at least two or three names.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how perfectly ridiculous!” she exclaimed. “Just as if we haven’t\r\nenough to remember one name apiece!”\r\n\r\nShe paused momentarily, and I was too much embarrassed to resume the\r\nconversation. Fortunately, she continued without my aid. “How many\r\nnames have you?” she inquired; and the playful light in her eyes told\r\nme that she could not have been more amused if asking how many hands or\r\nfeet I had.\r\n\r\n“Only two,” I admitted, glad that I had not to confess to three or\r\nfour. “I am called Anson Harkness.”\r\n\r\n“Anson Harkness,” she repeated, slowly, as if savoring the peculiar\r\nsound. “Why, if that isn’t the strangest name I ever heard!”\r\n\r\n“Where I come from it isn’t considered strange,” I assured her. “Of\r\ncourse, in my country everything is very different--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” she interposed. “You come from above the sea.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?” I cried, astonished.\r\n\r\nAgain she peered at me in surprise, and almost, I thought, with\r\nsomething of that puzzled air with which one regards a child who\r\npersists in asking the ridiculous. “Why, of course you must come from\r\nabove the sea,” she explained. “Where else is there to come from?”\r\n\r\n“And do the people here all know we come from above the sea?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” declared Aelios, a naïve seriousness replacing the\r\nfrolicsome air of the moment before. “That’s what we’ve all been\r\nworrying about. We thought we were proof against invasions from above,\r\nand we simply can’t understand how you got here. Why, for three\r\nthousand years the upper world doesn’t seem even to have suspected our\r\nexistence.”\r\n\r\n“Three thousand years?” I burst forth. “Three thousand years? Then, for\r\nGod’s sake, how old is this land of yours? And, in heaven’s name, what\r\ncountry is this, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I thought you knew,” murmured Aelios, with a look of surprise.\r\n“This is Atlantis, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Atlantis!” I ejaculated, in overpowering amazement. “Atlantis!” And\r\nconfused visions of a lost continent swarmed through my mind, and I\r\nwondered whether this could be the sunken world described by Plato.\r\n\r\nBut before I could utter another word, my attention was diverted by\r\nan unpardonable intrusion. “Great shades of Alexander, having a nice\r\nlittle tête-a-tête, are you?” came a familiar voice from the rear; and\r\nStranahan, stalking up uninvited, deposited himself on a seat just to\r\nthe left of Aelios, and grinningly requested us not to heed him, but to\r\ngo right on with our little talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                            The Submergence\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Stranahan, of course, had its effect. Not only did he\r\ninterrupt my conversation with Aelios at a crucial point, but he made\r\nit impossible for the discussion to take a personal turn. I realized,\r\nto be sure, that he was actuated by motives of good fellowship, but I\r\nfelt that he exhibited remarkably poor sense; and I am afraid that I\r\ndisplayed not a little of my displeasure in the forced welcome that I\r\nfrowned upon the intruder. But Stranahan appeared to be afflicted with\r\nno foolish sensitiveness; and, having decided to join us, he seemed not\r\nto notice the frozen reception I accorded him.\r\n\r\nAnd like one determined to see things through to the end, he remained\r\nresolutely with us. He seemed scarcely discouraged by his limited\r\nknowledge of the language, which made him a total stranger to most of\r\nwhat we were saying; and for a good part of our conversation, he sat\r\nby in gaping ignorance, venturing an occasional remark with such poor\r\ndisplay of grammar and pronunciation that I could only smile.\r\n\r\nYet our discussion was so engrossing that for minutes at a time I quite\r\nforgot the existence of Stranahan. Even the bright sparkling eyes of\r\nAelios had for the moment no more than an impersonal interest for me,\r\nfor I found myself making a discovery so strange, so amazing and so\r\nutterly unprecedented as to upset my conception of human history.\r\n\r\n“Can this really be Atlantis?” I heard myself inquiring, once the\r\ndisturbance created by Stranahan’s arrival had subsided. “Can this\r\nreally be the famous lost Atlantis?”\r\n\r\n“The lost Atlantis?” repeated Aelios, looking perplexed. “I didn’t know\r\nthere was any lost Atlantis.”\r\n\r\nI explained as briefly as possible the legend of the ancient continent\r\nthat was said to have sunk beneath the sea. “If there’s any truth\r\nin the story, that was one of the greatest disasters in history,”\r\nI remarked, trying to lend importance to what I felt to be but the\r\nflimsiest of myths.\r\n\r\n“Disaster!” echoed Aelios, her perplexity deepening. “Disaster! This\r\nis the first time I ever heard any one call the submergence a disaster!”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean, then, that there actually was a submergence?” I demanded.\r\n“That a whole continent sank beneath the waves?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course!” she exclaimed, astonished at so self-evident a\r\nquestion. “How else do you think we got here beneath the sea?” And she\r\npointed significantly to the great greenish roof and the bright, golden\r\norbs above us, while into her eyes came a wonderfully sweet, indulgent\r\nlight, as into the eyes of one who delights to teach children the\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\n“Where did you suppose we could be now,” she continued, “except in\r\nArcheon, the Capital of Atlantis?”\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Stranahan thought it time to let himself\r\nbe heard. He drew his lips far apart as if to speak, uttered an\r\ninarticulate syllable or two, and then stopped abruptly short, as\r\nthough unable to frame the desired words.\r\n\r\n“What is it, my friend?” asked Aelios, turning to Stranahan with a\r\ngracious smile. But since Stranahan could only gape idiotically in\r\nreply, I thought it my duty to answer for him.\r\n\r\n“What I cannot understand,” I said, returning to the question that had\r\nbeen puzzling me most of all, “is that you say there was a submergence,\r\nand yet seem to think it was not a disaster. Surely, if the whole\r\ncontinent of Atlantis was lost--”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think the whole continent was lost?” demanded Aelios, a\r\nquizzical, almost amused light in her great blue eyes. “Why, the better\r\npart of Atlantis is safe here beneath the sea!”\r\n\r\n“Safe here beneath the sea?” I cried, in growing confusion. “Why, how\r\nis that possible?”\r\n\r\n“That is a long story,” she started to explain. “It goes back very far,\r\nthousands of years, in fact--”\r\n\r\n“And cannot you tell me that story?” I proposed, eagerly. “Cannot you\r\ntell me from the beginning? Remember, I am a stranger here and find\r\neverything very confusing. What is this Atlantis of yours? And how old\r\nis it? And how large? And how did it come to be submerged? And how does\r\nit happen that you are living here now beneath the ocean?”\r\n\r\n“Whole volumes have been written in answer to those questions,”\r\ndeclared Aelios, with a winning smile. “But I’ll try to explain\r\neverything as best I can.” And she paused momentarily, while Stranahan\r\ncraned his long neck far forward, as if to take in all that she had to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n“It is perhaps the most romantic tale in history,” she resumed,\r\nspeaking almost with exaltation, while her eyes took on a far-away\r\ndreamy look that I thought most becoming, and her upper lip twitched\r\nwith the same sympathetic quivering I had noted before. “Atlantis is\r\none of the most ancient republics in the world, and at one time was\r\nthe most populous and powerful of all countries. Our history goes back\r\nmore than seven thousand years, four thousand above the sea and three\r\nthousand beneath--four thousand years of growth, tumult and conquest,\r\nand three thousand years of maturity and peace. At a time when Egypt\r\nand Babylonia were still unheard of, our engineers reared monuments\r\nmore massive than the pyramids; and when Babylonia and Egypt were in\r\nthe full pride of their renown our people regarded them contemptuously\r\nas the merest barbarian tribes. Our accomplishments were to them what\r\ntheirs were to the unclothed blacks of the south; and our country\r\nsurpassed theirs as a marble palace surpasses a clay hut.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“But what was the precise location of your country? And how large was\r\nit?” I interposed.\r\n\r\n“It was in an isolated position a full day’s sailing west of the\r\nPillars of Hercules. As for its size, it was large, and yet not\r\noverwhelmingly so; a swift runner might have traveled around it between\r\nfull moon and full moon. But today you might took vainly for its plains\r\nand snow-tipped mountains, for above all but its highest peaks, the\r\nunbroken waters foam and toss.”\r\n\r\nAelios paused momentarily, and a melancholy reminiscent light came into\r\nher eyes, while her long, lithe fingers toyed absently with the folds\r\nof her lavender gown.\r\n\r\n“Ah, how sad!” I could not forebear murmuring. “What a ghastly tragedy!”\r\n\r\n“No, not a tragedy,” she quickly denied, regarding me again with a\r\npeculiar surprise that I could not understand. “There is no tragedy in\r\nthe history of Atlantis, though of course there might have been.”\r\n\r\n“No tragedy?” I cried, wondering vaguely if Aelios could be trying to\r\nmake sport of me. “Is it not tragedy for a whole great country to be\r\nsubmerged?”\r\n\r\n“It may be, or again it may not be,” she replied, enigmatically. “In\r\nthis case, it was not.”\r\n\r\nNoting my quizzical silence, she continued, with a reassuring smile,\r\n“No doubt you will find this difficult to understand. In your world\r\nabove seas, conditions are perhaps very different from those of old\r\nAtlantis. Certainly, you are spared the perils which we faced, and\r\nwhich compelled us to submerge our continent.”\r\n\r\n“Compelled you to submerge your continent?” I repeated, growing more\r\namazed each instant. “Do you mean to say you submerged it deliberately?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. How else?” she returned, in matter-of-fact tones. “The\r\nSubmergence--or the Deliverance, as it is sometimes called--was the\r\nmost fortunate event in our history. We celebrate it annually at our\r\ngreat festival, the Festival of the Good Destruction.”\r\n\r\nAgain she paused, as if uncertain how to proceed, while I was forced to\r\njoin Stranahan in a bewildered silence.\r\n\r\n“In order to make things clear,” she continued at length, with upper\r\nlip still fluttering and eyes that smiled with kindly good will, “I\r\nsuppose I will have to describe Atlantis as it was in the old days,\r\nthe days before the flood. Thirty-one hundred years ago, or at the\r\ntime when the Submergence was first proposed, we were in possession\r\nof secrets which the upper world has perhaps not rediscovered even\r\ntoday. I will not speak of our art, literature and philosophy, which,\r\nthough advanced for their day, were incomparably inferior to what we\r\nhave since produced; it was in scientific spheres that our progress\r\nwas most pronounced. From the beginning, our science was a strangely\r\nlopsided growth; it was most developed on the purely material side;\r\nand while it could tell us how to compute a comet’s weight and enabled\r\nus to communicate with the people of Mars, still on the whole it\r\nwas concerned with such practical questions as how to produce food\r\nartificially or how to utilize new sources of energy. And in these\r\ndirections it was amazingly efficient. We had long passed the stage,\r\nfor example, when we needed to rely upon steam, gasoline or electricity\r\nto run our motors or to carry us over the ground or through the air;\r\nwe had mastered the life-secret of matter itself, and by means of the\r\nenergy within the atoms could produce power equal to that of a tornado\r\nor of a volcanic eruption.”\r\n\r\n“Marvelous!” I exclaimed, enthusiastically. “Marvelous! What\r\nmagnificent opportunities that gave you!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that was just the trouble,” pursued Aelios, the trace of a frown\r\ndarkening her lovely cheeks and eyes. “There are some opportunities\r\nthat no men should have. What would be the gain in giving a wasp the\r\npower of a bull? It was not a mere coincidence, for example, that\r\nthe decline of art was simultaneous with the rise of science. After\r\nthousands of years in which the pursuit of the beautiful had been\r\none of the objects of life, men began to be bewildered by the idea\r\nof their conquest over matter; they came to apply themselves to the\r\nconstruction of huge and intricate machines, of towering but unsightly\r\npiles of masonry, of swift means of locomotion and of unique and\r\nelaborate systems of amusement. And at the same time they devoted\r\nthemselves extensively to destruction. Not to the destruction of\r\ntheir own monstrous contrivances, alas! but to the undermining of\r\nhuman happiness and human life. In our isolated position, we had had\r\ncomparatively little intercourse for centuries with other lands; but\r\nnow that we possessed lightning means of travel and lightning weapons\r\nof aggression, our citizens began to swoop down occasionally upon a\r\nforeign cast, picking a quarrel with the people and finding some excuse\r\nfor smiting thousands dead. At first, of course, our enemies had no\r\nmeans of retaliation, but it was certain that in the end they would\r\nhave imitated our methods and singed us with our own fire.”\r\n\r\n“And is that what actually happened?” I asked, fancying I saw a trace\r\nof light at last. “Is that why you had to submerge your land?”\r\n\r\n“No, that is not what happened,” said Aelios, smiling at my naïveté,\r\nwhile a half-suppressed yawn from Stranahan gave her but little\r\nencouragement to continue. “Not all our people were savages, and\r\nnot all approved of our policy of international murder; nor were\r\nall content to see art and beauty trodden down by the twin hoofs of\r\nmechanism and multiple production. Of course, the protestants were at\r\nfirst mere voices wailing against the waves, and more than one was\r\njeered as a maniac; but the protest continued and grew through many\r\ndecades; and though there were thousands that continued to appraise the\r\ncities by their size and scientific accomplishment by its deadliness,\r\nthe time came when the party of rebellion was almost as numerous as the\r\nconservatives or ‘Respectables,’ and when the limitation of mechanical\r\npower became an issue that threatened the very life of the State.\r\n\r\n“I will not trouble you with the details of that struggle, or with the\r\npowerful cause made out by the enemies of Super-Science--for of this\r\nyou shall hear more later. For the present it is sufficient to state\r\nthat the climax arrived in the year 56 B. S.----”\r\n\r\n“What does B. S. mean?” I interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Before the Submergence, of course!” explained Aelios, with a slight\r\nfrown that instantly made way for a broad and glowing smile.\r\n\r\n“It was in the year 56,” she proceeded, “that the Agripides ministry\r\ncame into office. Following the open insurrection of beauty-lovers\r\nagainst the ‘Respectables,’ the Anti-Mechanism party triumphed in a\r\ngeneral election; and Agripides, known by his friends as ‘Savior of the\r\nWorld’ and by his foes as the ‘City-Wrecker,’ began to carry out the\r\nrevolutionary policies he had been advocating for years.\r\n\r\n“These policies, which were perhaps the most daring ever conceived\r\nby the human mind, contemplated nothing less than the overthrow of\r\nexisting civilization and the substitution of something better suited\r\nto endure. It was Agripides’ contention--and a contention established\r\nby the researches of the very scientists he opposed--that the State of\r\nAtlantis, under current conditions, had a potential life of not more\r\nthan five hundred years; that it was burning away its energies with\r\nprofligate abandon, and would soon droop withering and exhausted into\r\npermanent decay. Its best human material was being used up and cast\r\naside like so much straw; its best social energies were being diverted\r\ninto wasteful and even poisonous channels; its too-rapid scientific\r\nprogress was imposing a wrenching strain upon the civilized mind and\r\ninstitutions. There was only one remedy, other than the natural one of\r\noblivion and death; and that remedy was in a complete metamorphosis, a\r\nchange such as the caterpillar undergoes when it enters the chrysalis,\r\na transformation into an environment of such repose that society might\r\nhave time to recover from its overgrowth and to evolve along quiet and\r\npeaceful lines.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother half-unconscious yawn from Stranahan imposed a brief\r\ninterruption at this point; but Aelios had now thoroughly warmed to her\r\ntheme; and, disregarding Stranahan’s rudeness, she continued almost\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\n“The proposal which Agripides had to make, and which he had been\r\nadvocating eloquently for years, was one that caused even the\r\nliberal-minded to gasp and shake their heads doubtfully. He declared,\r\nin a word, that Atlantis was not sufficiently isolated and enisled;\r\nthat it would never be safe while exposed to the tides of commerce\r\nand worldly affairs; that the only rational course was for it first\r\nto destroy whatever was noxious within itself, and then to prevent\r\nfurther contamination by walling itself off completely from the rest\r\nof the planet. And since no sea however wide and no fortress however\r\nstrong would be efficacious in warding off the hordes of mankind, the\r\none possible plan would be to go where no men could follow; to seal\r\nAtlantis up hermetically in an air-tight case--in other words, to sink\r\nthe whole island to the bottom of the sea!”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” I exclaimed, horrified at so strange a suggestion.\r\n“Sounds just like a lunatic’s ravings!”\r\n\r\n“No, quite the opposite,” replied Aelios, with an indulgent smile. “I\r\nsee you don’t understand at all. Agripides was not a lunatic; he was\r\nthe greatest man that ever lived.”\r\n\r\n“I thought he must be either a madman or a genius,” I returned, dryly.\r\n\r\n“Look, I’ll show you!” she flung out, almost as a challenge, since I\r\ndid not seem convinced of her hero’s greatness. And rising hurriedly\r\nand flitting a dozen paces down the colonnade, she pointed to a\r\nlife-sized marble bust on a panel between the columns. “See! That is\r\nAgripides! Does that look like the face of a lunatic?”\r\n\r\nHastily I had followed Aelios, with Stranahan at my heels; and he\r\njoined me in surveying the bust with a show of interest, though his\r\npuzzled expression showed that he did not know and much less cared\r\nwho Agripides may have been. “The glorious saints have mercy on us,\r\nif he hasn’t a beard like a goat!” was his one and only comment. But\r\nI did not deign to reply, and fixed my eyes sternly and appraisingly\r\nupon the countenance of Agripides. The hair and beard were perhaps a\r\nlittle long, I thought, unconsciously agreeing with Stranahan; but the\r\nfeatures were the most striking I had ever seen in any human being.\r\nLike many of the faces which have come down to us from classical times,\r\nthis countenance combined intellect and beauty to a singular degree.\r\nThe brow was broad, as in the representations of Homer, but it also\r\nrose to a majestic dominance; the eyes were large and alert, the lips\r\nthin and compressed, the cheeks long and firmly modelled, while the\r\nfeatures were furrowed with deep lines of sympathy that reminded me\r\nof Lincoln, and at the same time were marked with a wistful, dreamy\r\nexpression that contrasted strangely with a savage, almost tigerish\r\ndetermination more implied than clearly graven on the even contours of\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n“Agripides was a remarkable orator, and at the same time a writer\r\nof force,” stated Aelios, as we returned to our seats. “Hundreds of\r\nhis essays and addresses have been preserved, and they show such\r\nbrilliance, vehemence, and wit, and at the same time such clarity and\r\nlogic of presentation, that it is little wonder that he converted\r\nall Atlantis to his way of thinking. Or perhaps it would not be fair\r\nto say that he converted all Atlantis--there was plenty of wordy\r\nopposition to his schemes, as well as several little armed revolts and\r\ninsurrections that had to be suppressed. But Agripides was not a man\r\nto be easily daunted, and in spite of the strenuous objections of the\r\n‘Respectables,’ the year 49 saw the publication of his complete plans\r\nfor the Submergence.\r\n\r\n“Those plans were more daring than the worst enemies of Agripides\r\ncould have anticipated. He proposed, in a word, to cover a large part\r\nof Atlantis with an enormous glass wall, reaching like an artificial\r\nsky, hundreds of feet above ground, and thick enough to withstand\r\nthe pressure of unthinkable tons of water. Near the base of this\r\nwall should be two great valves, one through which the ocean might\r\nbe admitted into a broad canal or artificial river, and a second\r\n(at the opposite end of Atlantis) through which the waters might be\r\nforced out again by means of gigantic intra-atomic pumps. I need not\r\nmention, of course, that deep wells and distilled sea water would\r\nserve for domestic and drinking purposes; that decomposed water would\r\nprovide sufficient oxygen for breathing; and that artificial sunlight,\r\nsynthesized chemically so as to produce the life-giving elements of\r\nthe original, would not only supply illumination but would support\r\nvegetation and human life as well.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, that is all very good,” said I, feeling that Aelios had not\r\nyet touched upon the most essential fact of all. “But how did Agripides\r\npropose to sink the island beneath the sea?”\r\n\r\n“That is a difficult question,” she murmured, with a smile that was\r\nworth more to me than volumes of knowledge. “It involves technical\r\nquestions of engineering with which, I must confess, I am very poorly\r\nacquainted. But, as I understand it, what Agripides proposed was\r\nthat enormous tank be buried under the sea bottom far to the west of\r\nAtlantis, and that, at a given signal, the water should be raised to\r\nboiling point by an application of intra-atomic heat. The resulting\r\ntons of steam, in their fury to escape, would create an explosion that\r\nwould burst the very floor of the sea; in one direction there would be\r\na gigantic upheaval, and a lifting of the ocean bed; and in another\r\ndirection, by way of reaction, there would be a sinking of the ocean\r\nbottom in an effort of the strata not directly affected, to fill in the\r\ngap left by those displaced. And while a whole vast area would rise\r\nthousands of feet (although not to the level of the water), another\r\narea would be forced downward an equal distance; and that area, which\r\nwould be of enormous extent, would include the island of Atlantis. To\r\nuse a crude illustration, one may think of a common plank, balanced on\r\nits center, of which one end cannot be tilted upward without causing\r\nthe other end to slant down; and one may imagine Atlantis as reposing\r\non the lower slope of such a plank.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“But that is all mere theory,” I pointed out. “Certainly, Agripides\r\nwouldn’t dare to sink the island merely on the basis of such unproved\r\ncalculations.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, of course not. The computations were all verified by actual\r\nexperiment. With the aid of two accomplished engineers, Agripides made\r\na small model of the continent and the surrounding ocean, accurately\r\nreproducing every detail; and, having stimulated an explosion under the\r\nproper conditions, he found that the miniature island sank precisely as\r\nhe expected the real island to do.”\r\n\r\n“Even so,” I argued, “would not the explosion have shattered the entire\r\ncrust of the earth? And would not the great glass dome have been split\r\nand ruined even if the ground beneath it remained firm?”\r\n\r\n“All that was duly provided for,” explained Aelios. “The submergence\r\nwas to be so gradual as to require several hours; and since the\r\nexplosion was to occur under the sea rather than under the island\r\nitself, it would shatter the crust of the earth only in remote\r\nlocalities, and the shock would not be severe enough to affect the\r\nglass wall. In other words--to make another comparison--the island was\r\nto be like a ship that sinks in its entirety after striking the reefs,\r\nalthough only the prow is damaged and the rest remains uninjured.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand perfectly,” said I, recalling my recent experiences\r\nin the X-111. “But even assuming that the experiment was perfectly\r\nsafe, how did Agripides ever persuade the people to sink their homes\r\nbeneath the sea?”\r\n\r\n“It was precisely there that he proved his greatness,” said Aelios,\r\ncasting an admiring glance in the direction of Agripides’ statue. “Well\r\nknowing that imagination is the most powerful force in human life, he\r\nbegan to work upon the imagination of the masses to show the dangers\r\nof civilization. Simultaneously with the publication of his plans for\r\nthe Submergence, he opened to the public an enormous exhibition palace\r\nin which he presented the most ghastly display in history. With the\r\nvision of the social philosopher and the intuition of the prophet, he\r\nhad constructed in miniature the Atlantis of the future as he conceived\r\nit would be--and no man could gaze upon that Atlantis without heartily\r\npraying for the Submergence. The landscape had been blasted, muddied\r\nand made black, and scarcely a green leaf could be seen; steel towers\r\nand smokestacks dotted the island until it looked like a range of\r\nartificial hills; great wheels and chains whirled and rattled in the\r\ndark interiors of the buildings, and to each wheel and chain a man was\r\ntied; and the huge engines and motors were fed with the blood of men,\r\nand watered with their tears. Innumerable multitudes--not only of men\r\nbut of women, and of sickly, pinch-faced children--were bound as slaves\r\nto the machines, and responded to automatic orders that the machines\r\nflashed forth; and after they had served long and their limbs were\r\ngrowing frail, they were crushed and mangled by the very masters they\r\nhad served, or else were cast out to perish like frost-bitten flies.\r\nBut the great wheels never ceased to turn or the levers to clatter, and\r\ntheir steel jaws gnashed the gouged-out hearts and brains of men, and\r\ntheir dust and cinders clouded the fields and forests, and their poison\r\nfumes invaded the lungs of the people, blunting their minds and making\r\nthem droop and die by the million.”\r\n\r\n“What a hideous picture!” I cried, with a shudder. “But certainly,\r\ncertainly it was an exaggeration!”\r\n\r\n“No, Agripides had no need to exaggerate. He merely showed the logical\r\nadvance upon existing advances. But this was the least grewsome of the\r\nexhibits. One half of the display, which he entitled ‘The Triumph of\r\nScience,’ was devoted to the supreme horror. Here again he depicted\r\nartificial landscapes and many-towered cities; but the wheels of those\r\ncities were not revolving, though smoke was indeed in the air. At first\r\nsight, they might hardly have been recognized as cities at all; they\r\nwere really little more than chaotic heaps of iron and stone; many of\r\nthe buildings had been blasted to fragments, some had toppled over,\r\nothers were mere mangled frameworks of steel. Scarcely more than an\r\nisolated wall remained standing here and there to show that this had\r\nbeen the home of men; but of the inhabitants themselves there was\r\nindeed an occasional sign: here one was futilely gasping for breath,\r\nwrithing on the ground like a tormented worm; there one was groping\r\ncrazily through the ruins, with torn breast and blinded eyes; yonder\r\na family group was lying sprawled at all angles, with pale faces\r\nconvulsed with their last agony.\r\n\r\n“But had one looked for the source of the destruction, one would not\r\neasily have found it--except that far above, so remote as scarcely to\r\nbe visible, a fleet of mosquito-like flying craft were buzzing on their\r\nway like stealthy marauders.”\r\n\r\nAelios paused, a deep seriousness darkening her fair features; and as\r\nI sat there regarding her in silence, I could not but reflect what\r\nunspeakable distances separated the bloody picture she described from\r\nthe enchanting scenes among which she dwelt.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Naturally,” she continued, “the people were not captivated with the\r\nthought of the future depicted by Agripides. And, Agripides, acting at\r\nthe psychological moment when all Atlantis was most aroused, convened\r\nthe National Assembly, and polled a majority of--three to one in favor\r\nof the Submergence! This majority being confirmed by a referendum of\r\nthe people, the great leader took immediate steps toward carrying out\r\nhis revolutionary project.\r\n\r\n“Nearly forty-eight years were consumed in the necessary preliminaries,\r\nand in that time Atlantis found itself forced halfway toward the\r\nrealization of Agripides’ direct prophecies. The island of Antiles, a\r\nsmall republic located far to westward, had spied out the aggressive\r\nschemes of the Atlantean military experts, and enlarging upon them,\r\nhad manufactured a fleet of poison-bearing aircraft capable of\r\nsmiting whole cities with death and ruin. That they were aimed for a\r\ncontemplated conflict with Atlantis there could be not a doubt; that\r\nsuch a conflict could not be averted by diplomacy was too self-evident\r\nto require demonstration; and that there was no resisting the\r\ndestructive airships was generally, although unofficially, admitted.\r\nConceivably, it was the dread of imminent disaster that restrained\r\nthe minds of the people from vacillating at the last moment and that\r\nbrought the plans of Agripides to their triumphant issue.\r\n\r\n“Agripides, unfortunately, did not survive to see the consummation of\r\nhis plans. Such a happiness was more than he had hoped for; the years\r\nwere already heavy upon him when his revolutionary ideas first won\r\napproval. But, dying peacefully at an advanced age in the year 15 B.\r\nS., he yet lived long enough to supervise the more important details of\r\nthe project and to be assured of its eventual success.\r\n\r\n“In accordance with Agripides’ directions, a reinforced glass\r\nwall many layers thick was erected over the most picturesque part\r\nof Atlantis, for it was agreed that the rest (which included the\r\nsite of many cities) was not worth saving. I shall not describe the\r\nsteps taken to insure the health and comfort of the people after the\r\nSubmergence, to rear elegant palaces and mansions, to duplicate the\r\nsunlight and to produce food chemically; I shall not even dwell upon\r\nthe Good Destruction, except to say that all save the most essential\r\nof power-driven tools were piled up in the doomed part of the island,\r\nto be buried on the day of the Submergence together with the towers\r\nof the deserted cities. But what I must mention--and this is most\r\nimportant--is that not all our people were content to be submerged;\r\nthat about one-third, irreconcilable to the last, emigrated eastward in\r\na great body a few months before the Submergence. It was this that made\r\nus most sad when Agripides’ plans were fulfilled and we sank at last to\r\nthe bottom of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever heard what happened to them?” I inquired, marveling at\r\nthis extraordinary migration.\r\n\r\n“No, how could we? We have never since established communication with\r\nthe earth. But I was thinking that perhaps you, who are from the upper\r\nworld, could give us some tidings of our lost fellow men.”\r\n\r\n“I am not sure but that I can,” I replied, slowly, thinking of the\r\nancient Greeks and their striking resemblances to the Atlanteans and\r\nwondering whether the immigrants from the sunken island might not have\r\nbeen among the original settlers of Athens and Corinth.\r\n\r\nAnd then, recalling the mystery of the “Telegonus,” that powerful lost\r\nHomeric epic, I perceived a possible clue. “Tell me,” I asked, though\r\nthe question was apparently irrelevant, “what do you know about Homer?”\r\n\r\n“Homer?” she echoed. And then, with the ease of perfect familiarity,\r\n“Why, Homer was one of the greatest poets we know of--almost equal to\r\nthe best that have arisen since the Good Destruction. He lived at about\r\nthe time of the Submergence in a country far to the East, with which\r\nwe had trade relations in spite of its half barbarous condition. It\r\nwas, in a way, a sort of dependency, a ward of Atlantis; and it was\r\nfrom us that its people derived their alphabet as well as much of their\r\nlanguage and many of their institutions. Possibly it was there that the\r\nAtlantean migrants settled.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see,” said I, with a flash of understanding. “Then you mean--”\r\n\r\nBut before I could utter another word, interruption came from an\r\nunexpected quarter. And with a jolt I returned from ancient Atlantis\r\nto the realities of my own life. “Hello, boys! Hello! Hello! There\r\nthey are, there they are!” came in loud familiar tones from our rear,\r\nfollowed by a salvo of cheers; and before Stranahan and I could quite\r\nrealize what was happening, we felt our hands grasped in a multitude of\r\nhands, and found ourselves surrounded by dozens, literally dozens, of\r\nwell known faces. The first I recognized was that of Captain Gavison,\r\nwho grinned happily in welcome; then I distinguished one after one\r\nthe faces of my fellow seamen, apparently all of them, and all of\r\nthem talking, laughing, crowding about, slapping us on the back, and\r\nshouting out greetings in tumultuous chorus.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ... although perhaps five hundred feet in length,\r\nit was as much like a great statue as like a building; it had none of\r\nthose features common in edifices for the shelter of man and his works,\r\nbut seemed to have been erected exclusively as a piece of art. Its form\r\nwas that of a woman, a woman reclining at full length ...]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                           Trial and Judgment\r\n\r\n\r\nTo our disappointment, we received no immediate explanation of the\r\narrival of Captain Gavison and his men. A score of the natives, who\r\nstood frowning in the background, appeared disinclined to permit any\r\nextended conversation; and it was but a minute before they motioned the\r\nnewcomers to follow them. I was interested to observe that all, from\r\nthe Captain down to the humblest recruit, obeyed as readily as though\r\nin response to an absolute master, marching not in military formation\r\nand yet at a regular pace and with every appearance of discipline.\r\n\r\nHaving nothing better to do, Stranahan and I trailed in their wake,\r\nfor at their first appearance Aelios had murmured a hasty “Good-bye”\r\nand had gone tripping out of sight around a bend in the colonnade.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes we saw our comrades entering a building we well\r\nknew--the palace of sapphire and amber. Although expecting to be\r\nordered out, we made bold to follow, and to our surprise passed through\r\nthe gates of the building and into its gorgeous interior without\r\nattracting any noticeable attention. Arriving at the great central\r\ntheatre, we observed that hundreds of the natives were assembled as\r\nthough in solemn debate. Many an eye was turned upon the newcomers\r\nin curiosity and amazement; but there was no audible murmur at our\r\nentrance. And when Captain Gavison and his followers were motioned to\r\nseats, Stranahan and I had no hesitation about joining them.\r\n\r\nBut the unlucky Stranahan was doomed to still further boredom. For\r\nnearly an hour he was compelled to listen to a discussion of which he\r\nunderstood scarcely a word. Certainly, he had cause to envy me, for I\r\neasily followed the greater part of what was said--and most unusual and\r\nabsorbing I found it!\r\n\r\nThe leader of the debate was a broad-browed woman, with a firm and\r\ndistinguished manner, and more than a trace of beauty in spite of her\r\ngraying hair. But she spoke comparatively little; and six or eight of\r\nthe audience took turns in standing in the open space in front and\r\ndelivering brief addresses. Their theme was not at first apparent\r\nto me; I thought that they were perhaps discussing some question of\r\npolitics, or pleading the merits of some new law; and I was surprised\r\nto discover that what they were arguing was no mere practical matter,\r\nbut concerned the architecture of a new building, to be known as the\r\n“Palace of the Ten Arts.” One, there was that suggested a lagoon\r\nfronting the edifice, a second who recommended rainbow fountains, and\r\na third who favored an arcade of multi-colored crystal; and all the\r\nproposals were heard with equal respect and duly noted down by the\r\nleader of the debate, who smiled benignantly upon all the speakers and\r\nrefrained from obtruding her personal preferences.\r\n\r\nI was relieved when at length all who desired to speak had had their\r\nsay. The leader now declared the meeting open for further business;\r\nand now it was that a tall young man, whom I recognized as one of the\r\nattendants of Captain Gavison and his men, rose quickly to his feet and\r\nadvanced with a determined air toward the speaker’s space. A hush of\r\nexpectation had come over the gathering; all eyes were fastened upon\r\nthe tall young man as though he had a message of rare importance.\r\n\r\nHis first words were to justify this impression. “Fellow citizens,”\r\nsaid he, speaking in a deep-toned voice which had something of that\r\nmusical quality common to his people, “I have to bring to your\r\nattention today a matter unique in the history of Atlantis. First,\r\nhowever, let me recall to your minds several facts with which you\r\nare no doubt familiar. Two months ago we were astonished to find in\r\nour midst two creatures whose sallow complexion, grotesque costume\r\nand still more grotesque features, proclaimed them not to be natives\r\nof Atlantis. How they had penetrated beneath the secluded dome of\r\nour country we could not imagine, but it was decided that the best\r\ncourse would be to educate them in our language, and, after they\r\nwere thoroughly conversant with the tongue, to question them in the\r\nattempt to solve the mystery. This decision was only reinforced by\r\nthe appearance of two more of the queer creatures a day or so later,\r\nand then again by the arrival of a third strange couple. While it\r\nwas feared that our age-old seclusion had been broken and that we\r\nwere being invaded by the upper world, still it was decided that for\r\nthe present the best course would be to maintain an unperturbed but\r\nvigilant silence.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused, and cleared his throat as though the important\r\npart of his address were to follow. “Only yesterday, fellow citizens,”\r\nhe continued, “you heard the startling sequel. A field naturalist,\r\nroaming along the Salty River in the wilderness beyond the furthest\r\ncolonnades, made the most surprising discovery of his life--a peculiar\r\nugly rod-like ship of unknown type, a ship that seemed to be fairly\r\nswarming with uncouth humans! Naturally, the scientist was alarmed;\r\nand, having made his escape, he hastened back to the city to secure\r\naid in capturing the aliens. As he described them, they were in every\r\nrespect like the barbarians of which ancient annals tell,--great,\r\nbrawny humans of unkempt and ferocious appearance. But we knew that\r\nthey could be no more redoubtable than their kindred who were already\r\namong us; we knew that they would be easily subdued by the superior\r\nminds and irresistible magnetic wills with which nature and a select\r\ninheritance have endowed our race. And when the twenty men of the\r\nsearching expedition set out early this morning, we had reason to\r\nbelieve that the aliens would be present by evening to face trial\r\nbefore this assemblage.\r\n\r\n“As you observe, we have not been disappointed. But now, fellow\r\ncitizens, the great problem arises. The prisoners appear to be unclean\r\nas well as wanton and unprincipled men. Contrary to all regulations,\r\nthey have been catching fish from the Salty River and using them\r\nfor food. They have been slaying unoffending crabs and turtles,\r\nand--disgusting though the idea be--frying and eating them! They have\r\nbeen polluting water of the stream; they have been trampling down the\r\nrarest seaweeds, and beating to death the daintiest of water-flowers;\r\nthey have been scrawling all sorts of crude and outlandish designs on\r\nthe delicate pink and blue of the roof-bearing columns.\r\n\r\n“But all this--criminal though it be--we may overlook for the moment.\r\nThe chief problem presented by the arrival of these aliens is of such\r\nwide-reaching social consequence that their minor transgressions pale\r\ninto insignificance. For the first time in more than three thousand\r\nyears, the principles of Agripides have been violated. Visitors\r\nfrom outside have at last appeared; at last we are in danger of\r\ncontamination by the passions and vices of the upper world. Whether the\r\ninvasion was deliberate is not definitely known, but how it was made is\r\nsufficiently clear: the barbarian ship, which was equipped to travel\r\nunder the sea, was sucked into the whirlpool at the ocean entrance of\r\nAtlantis and forced into the valve through which the waters of the\r\nSalty River find admittance. Of course, this trespass may have been\r\nmerely accidental; but remembering the warlike and unfriendly ways of\r\nthe upper world, I personally suspect that the intrusion was planned\r\nwith cunning design, and that other invading craft--possibly a whole\r\ninvading fleet--may be expected to arrive. Fellow citizens, what is\r\nyour opinion?”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmid general silence the speaker took his seat--applause was apparently\r\nunknown among the Atlanteans. But this fact did not then enter into my\r\nthoughts; I was too much enraged at the tall young man’s misstatements.\r\nWith a lack of self-consciousness that I can explain only by my\r\nblinding fury, I found myself doing the unprecedented.\r\n\r\nSpringing excitedly to my feet, I demanded, hotly, in the native\r\ntongue, “Friends, may I say a word?”\r\n\r\nInstantly hundreds of pairs of eyes were turned upon me in surprise; I\r\nsaw that I had no more been expected to speak than if I had been a tree\r\nor a stone. But the glances that were darted at me were not unfriendly,\r\nand as yet I was too much incensed to regret my words.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, you may say all you wish,” rang out the clear, well-rounded\r\ntones of the lady leader of the debate. “This is the Hall of Public\r\nEnlightenment, you know, and any person with anything to say will\r\ngladly be heard.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, old sport, give it to them good!” whispered Stranahan into my\r\near, although he could not have caught the drift of what was happening;\r\nand, with his words rankling in my mind, I started toward the speaker’s\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nBut as I took my place before that silent, staring multitude, I wished\r\nthat I could have been safely back in my seat. Something suspiciously\r\nlike fear overcame me--what right had I to be addressing this strange\r\nassemblage? What reason to expect that I could speak their language\r\nintelligibly? Yet necessity prodded me on; and, after gaping stonily\r\nat the spectators, I found myself somehow uttering a series of more\r\nor less connected sounds. I did not say what I had intended, and I\r\nsuspect that more than one English word got itself intertwined with my\r\nAtlantean vocabulary; but I was encouraged when I observed that all\r\neyes were fixed upon me with apparent interest, and that no one openly\r\nlaughed or so much as tittered, though one or two (and among them\r\nStranahan) could hardly suppress a smile.\r\n\r\nAfter a vague, sputtering introduction that I cannot begin to recall,\r\nI found myself on fairly solid ground. I declared that I could\r\nanswer many of the questions which the previous speaker had put; I\r\nexplained that my companions and myself were not barbarians, being\r\nrepresentatives of the highest of modern civilizations; I stated that\r\nwe had no evil intentions, having come to Atlantis by accident, and\r\ncertainly not being the forerunners of a wave of invasion; and, at the\r\nsame time, I offered our thanks for the treatment already accorded us,\r\nand expressed our intention to abide by the laws of Atlantis and to act\r\nin conformity with the best traditions of the land.\r\n\r\nAs I took my seat, I could see from the faces of my hearers that I\r\nhad produced a favorable effect. Many were the nods of approval that\r\ngreeted me, and many the sympathetic smiles. But at the same time I\r\ncould perceive that I had not made myself perfectly clear; and when a\r\nscore of voices simultaneously requested that I return to the platform,\r\nI had no other choice.\r\n\r\nQuestions regarding my native land were now rained upon me in\r\nprofusion. But whether because of my limited knowledge of the language\r\nor because the experience of the Atlanteans differed so fundamentally\r\nfrom my own, I had great difficulty in making myself understood. My\r\ndescription of the growth and attainments of the modern world was\r\nlistened to with interest, but with a lack of comprehension that I\r\nthought almost idiotic. Thus, when I declared that the United States\r\nwas a leading nation because of its population of a hundred million,\r\nits rare inventions and its prolific manufactures, my hearers merely\r\nlooked blank and asked how the country ranked in art; and when I stated\r\n(what surely is self-evident to all patriotic Americans) that New\r\nYork is the greatest city on earth because of its tall buildings and\r\nits capacity for housing a million human beings in one square mile,\r\nmy audience regarded me with something akin to horror, and one of the\r\nmen--evidently a dolt, for he seemed quite serious--asked whether no\r\nsteps had even been taken to abolish the evil.\r\n\r\nBut it was when describing my own career that I was most grievously\r\nmisunderstood. Had I confessed to murder, the people could not have\r\nbeen more shocked than when I mentioned that I was one of the crew of\r\na ship commissioned to ram and destroy other ships; and I felt that\r\nmy prestige was ruined beyond repair when I stated that I had entered\r\nthe war voluntarily. Even the most friendly hearers seemed to draw\r\nunconsciously away from me after my recital; loathing and disgust\r\nshowed plainly in their faces, as though I had announced myself to\r\nbe an African cannibal or a Polynesian head hunter. Only too plainly\r\nI perceived that what was termed heroism among my fellows was here\r\nregarded as villainy. It did little good to explain that war was a\r\ncherished custom in the upper world, and that patriotism was among the\r\nprime virtues; it was useless to plead that there might be reasons\r\nfor taking the lives of men, whom one had never seen, and that such\r\nreasons were generally recognized among civilized nations. The more I\r\nargued, the greater the abhorrence I aroused; and beyond an occasional\r\nmurmured “Agripides was right,” my words brought little direct reply.\r\nAnd at length I returned to my seat feeling myself to be in disgrace,\r\nyet curbing my embarrassment by inwardly cursing the stupidity of the\r\nAtlanteans.\r\n\r\nThe remaining business of the assemblage was disposed of quickly\r\nenough. Following my retreat, the tall young man again addressed the\r\nmeeting, reminding his audience that they had not yet passed judgment\r\nupon us. “Fellow citizens,” said he, in conclusion, “I have a proposal\r\nto make, which, so far as I can see, is the only one possible under the\r\ncircumstances. Whether we like it or not, we must recognize that the\r\nintruders are here; and, though we did not will their presence, we must\r\ntreat them humanely. Since we cannot dispose of them by violence and\r\nsince we must accept their assurance that no others of their kind are\r\nto follow, we must let them remain, and see that they are educated and\r\nput to work like all other citizens. But one thing we must insist upon\r\nabove all else: the isolation of Atlantis must be protected, and the\r\ncountries above seas must never learn of our existence. Hence we must\r\ndecree that, no matter how many years go by, none of the aliens shall\r\never return to the upper world!”\r\n\r\nAnd it was with a sinking heart, with the hopelessness of one being\r\nsentenced to life imprisonment, that I heard the assemblage endorse\r\nthis recommendation.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Half a dozen of the queerest beings we had ever seen\r\ncame crowding into our path ... from the blank amazed stares with which\r\nthey greeted us, it was evident that our appearance was as much a\r\nsurprise to them as theirs was to us. But from a certain sternness and\r\nresolution which invested their faces following the first speechless\r\nastonishment, we concluded that they had probably seen others of our\r\nkind, and were not disposed to treat us leniently.]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                          The Upper World Club\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next few hours, Captain Gavison and the new-found members of\r\nhis crew were all provided with the native garb and lodged in sumptuous\r\nquarters in various parts of the city. They looked peculiar indeed in\r\ntheir new costumes of light blue and green and yellow, and grumbled not\r\na little at the change; but they confessed to their relief at having\r\nleft the X-111; and not even the prospect of passing their remaining\r\ndays in Atlantis sufficed to neutralize their joy.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as I could determine, they had had an altogether wretched\r\ntime during the past few weeks. A spirit of panic had grown among them,\r\nfollowing the failure of Rawson and myself to return from our searching\r\nexpedition, and neither by bribe nor by threat could any other member\r\nof the crew be induced to venture into that wilderness where we had\r\ndisappeared. And so they had all remained anxiously in the vicinity of\r\nthe disabled ship, drinking the distilled water of the Salty River and\r\nsnatching what food they could from the land while exhausting their\r\nvessel’s reserve supplies. How long they could have held out it was\r\nimpossible to say, but certainly they could not have held out long;\r\nmadness had been overtaking them with the delay and the suspense; and,\r\nbut for the timely arrival of the natives, bloody disaster might have\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nYet, while they realized that they had been rescued from possible\r\ndestruction, I must not give the impression that they were altogether\r\ncontented with their new surroundings, or that their queer native\r\ngarments constituted their only source of complaint. Being normal human\r\nbeings, they found abundant cause for dissatisfaction. And, indeed,\r\nthey were not much to blame, for how could they adapt themselves\r\nimmediately to an environment so unfamiliar as that of Atlantis? For\r\nsome time they walked about like men in a daze; or, rather, like men\r\nwho know they are dreaming and expect shortly to awaken; and they\r\nstared with incredulous eyes at the marble columns of the Sunken World,\r\nits sculpture-lined thoroughfares and statuesque palaces. And what\r\nwonder if they were dazzled and yet a little frightened by this beauty,\r\nwhich seemed to them so cold and alien a thing? What wonder if the more\r\nsuperstitious shuddered a little at times, and muttered to themselves\r\nin the presence of what they took to be the supernatural? What wonder\r\nif they missed the familiar things of the earth, the scenes and the\r\nfaces they had left behind them, the habits they had discarded and the\r\nremembered life that was dwindling to a shadow?\r\n\r\nFortunately, they were not always free to brood over their misfortunes.\r\nLike those of their shipmates who had preceded them to Archeon,\r\nthey were at once supplied with tutors who sought to teach them the\r\nAtlantean tongue. Each of them received at least two hours a day of\r\npersonal instruction, and each was required to devote several hours to\r\nvarious prescribed written exercises. It need hardly be stated that\r\nnot all of them took kindly to this enforced application, for most of\r\nthem were anything but studious by nature; but the tutors persisted\r\neven though their task was a hard one, and prevailed by means of that\r\nmagnetic dominance I had often noted in the Atlanteans; and all of the\r\ncrew, from the grizzled McCrae to the callow young Barnfield, were soon\r\nplodding regularly over their lessons in grammar and spelling.\r\n\r\nBut among a group of nearly forty men, it was but natural that some\r\nshould make more willing and able students than others. And so,\r\nwhile the more backward were still struggling with the elements of\r\nAtlantean, others were striding toward a speaking knowledge. Among\r\nthe latter was Captain Gavison, who still had a position to maintain,\r\nand could not let himself be outdone by his men. Whether because of a\r\nnatural aptitude or of diligent application, he speedily outdistanced\r\nall his crew, with the exception (I must modestly admit) of one\r\nwhose pre-war specialty had been Greek. And partly on account of his\r\nevident supremacy in Atlantean, but more largely owing to the force of\r\nironclad habit, he was still the acknowledged leader of us all; and\r\nhis word still was like the word of a king, his approval still a favor\r\nto be courted and his anger a thing to make one quail, although his\r\ncommission from the United States Navy Department, could hardly give\r\nhim any authority here in Atlantis.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it was at Captain Gavison’s prompting, or\r\nwhether it was at the suggestion of one of the men, that we took the\r\nstep which was to band us more closely together. At all events, the\r\nstep was inevitable; for all of us felt like kinsmen isolated among\r\nstrangers, and our common experiences and common origin constituted an\r\nirresistible bond.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that we found ourselves convening one afternoon--the\r\nwhole thirty-nine of us--in a little colonnaded court in one of the\r\ncity parks. All of us were waiting in vociferous expectancy, for it had\r\nbeen whispered that important events were in store; and so we listened\r\neagerly when Captain Gavison arrived, and took the center of the stage,\r\nlaunching at once into an address.\r\n\r\n“The proposal has been made,” he announced, beginning without\r\nformality, “that we all join forces by forming a social club. We’re all\r\nin the same boat still, you see, even though we’re out of the X-111.\r\nMost of us feel rather out of place down here in Atlantis; we find the\r\npeople strange, the land stranger still, and the customs strangest of\r\nall. And so the best way will be to stick together and try to make\r\nthings agreeable for one another ...” And in this vein he continued\r\nfor five or ten minutes, pointing out the advantages of union, the\r\nincreased power as well as the social gain, the possibility of making\r\nour will felt in Atlantis if we acted in concert.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, he asked for opinions--and received them in\r\nabundance....\r\n\r\n“If we got together and started a club,” summarized Stangale, whose\r\nviews coincided with the majority, “things might begin to look a little\r\nless dead. Seems to me every day down here is Sunday!”\r\n\r\n“Sure, and they’ve got lots of Sunday closing laws, too!” Stranahan\r\ncontributed, with a wry grimace to ward the massive columns and tinted\r\nstatuary.\r\n\r\nVery tactfully Captain Gavison reminded Stranahan that the question to\r\nbe decided did not concern the Sunday regulations of the Atlanteans.\r\nAnd without further dalliance he raised his voice and inquired how many\r\nwere in favor of a social club.\r\n\r\nThe proposal having been accepted by unanimous acclaim, the next\r\nquestion was one of nomenclature. Various names were suggested: “The\r\nWoodrow Wilson Club,” “The Theodore Roosevelt Club,” “The U. S. A.\r\nClub,” “The X-111 Club,” “The Underseas Association”--but finally,\r\nafter much pointless debating, we decided that, since we were the sole\r\nrepresentatives of the upper world in Atlantis, the most appropriate\r\ntitle would be “The Upper World Club.”\r\n\r\nHaving threshed out this important matter, we now felt it necessary to\r\nelect the officers of “The Upper World Club.”\r\n\r\nObviously, there was only one possible nominee for President. It seemed\r\nalmost a matter of form to propose the name of Gavison; and once this\r\nname had been mentioned, the election was settled, for there was no\r\none daring enough to run in opposition or even to think of suggesting\r\nanother candidate.\r\n\r\nAfter being duly installed in office, the Captain made his inaugural\r\naddress. It was brief and to the point. He began by thanking us in\r\nconventional terms for the honor and by assuring us that he would try\r\nto run the club as well as if it were a ship under his command. And he\r\nconcluded with a declaration of policy: “We’re all of us caught like\r\nrats in a trap, you know, so while we’re here there’s nothing to do but\r\nto try to make the best of our prison. And I think the Upper World Club\r\nshould be the means. It should have, I believe, the following objects:\r\nfirst, to bring us together for social purposes. Secondly, it should\r\ngive us the chance to discuss our problems in this strange world, and\r\nshould be the means of expressing our combined views to the Atlanteans.\r\nLastly, it should keep us all together, so that we can act in unison if\r\nthe time ever comes to make a dash for liberty.”\r\n\r\n“That time will never come!” I surprised myself by exclaiming, after\r\nGavison had lapsed into silence. And, finding all eyes bent upon me\r\ninquiringly, I felt bound to continue.\r\n\r\n“Let us not deceive ourselves by the thought of escape,” I proceeded,\r\nstepping toward the center of the assemblage. “We are buried beneath\r\nthousands of feet of water, and for all practical purposes America is\r\nas far from us as the moon. Even if there were a way back, what good\r\nwould that do us when we cannot even leave this city against the will\r\nof the Atlanteans? No, my friends, let us look facts in the face. We\r\nshall remain here till we are gray and toothless, and shall never see\r\nthe United States again. And let us try to reconcile ourselves to that\r\ncertainty. Let us try to become citizens of Atlantis, and share in the\r\nlife about us ...”\r\n\r\nAnd in this vein I continued for some minutes, while my hearers\r\nfollowed me with transparent interest, and reluctantly nodded agreement.\r\n\r\nIn general, my words may have been without effect; but they had at\r\nleast one result I had not anticipated. For when, a few moments later,\r\nGavison announced that nominations were in order for Vice-President,\r\nI was surprised to find that my name was the first put forward, and\r\nthat no others were put forward at all--so that I was selected without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nAfter I had duly thanked my fellow club members for this honor, the\r\nPresident turned to me, and said, “Harkness, I appoint you a committee\r\nof one to confer with me in drawing up the constitution of the Upper\r\nWorld Club.” And with that the meeting adjourned.\r\n\r\nAnd thus began my intimacy with Captain Gavison. I do not know how\r\nseriously he took the Upper World Club and its constitution, for at\r\nmost times his grim, firm face was inscrutable; but he acted as if he\r\ntook it seriously indeed, and he and I spent hours together debating\r\nand planning for the club, almost as though we had had to draw up a\r\npact not for thirty-nine individuals but for thirty-nine sovereign\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nHow much the club profited from our activities shall always be a\r\nquestion in my mind; but I am certain that I personally profited a\r\ngreat deal, and make bold to believe that even Gavison was not without\r\nbenefit. Although he had a habit of shutting his thin lips stoically\r\nand glaring upon the world with stern, impassive air, an occasional\r\nlook of weariness and even of melancholy in his keen gray eyes told me\r\nthat he too was suffering from loneliness; and while he would have been\r\nthe last man in the world to make such an admission openly, he made it\r\ntacitly by the amount of time he spent in my company, theoretically\r\ndrawing up the constitution of the Upper World Club. He was always far\r\nfrom loquacious; frequently he was taciturn indeed, and would simply\r\nsit before me with a detached and meditative air, occasionally grunting\r\nsome comment or question in response to my remarks. Perhaps the\r\nconsciousness of the former gulf between us would not leave him; but\r\nall the while I felt that we were drawing together, were even beginning\r\nto look upon one another with a genuine, although undemonstrative\r\nregard. Certainly, he was emerging by degrees from the thick shell of\r\nhis reticence, as I was emerging from mine. We began quite naturally by\r\na discussion of Atlantis and the Atlanteans; and gradually we ventured\r\ninto more personal subjects. There came a day when I went so far as to\r\ntell him of my former life, my training in ancient Greek, my betrothal\r\nto Alma Huntley; and, responsive to my confidence, he offered me one or\r\ntwo glimpses into his own past, and made himself appear more human than\r\never before, by stating that he had a wife and two little daughters in\r\nNew York, who no doubt were even now mourning him as lost.\r\n\r\n“You know, Harkness, that’s the hardest thing of all to bear,” he\r\nsaid, while his thin fingers stroked his bristly chin ruminatingly,\r\nand the drawn lines of his gaunt face enhanced his habitual gravity.\r\n“If there were only some way of getting word to them, it wouldn’t be\r\nso bad. But I might be dead for all they know--and would you believe\r\nit, Harkness, sometimes it seems to me as if I’m actually in my tomb.”\r\nAnd the Captain averted his gaze, and after staring into vacancy for an\r\nindeterminate period, he continued, speaking more rapidly, and almost\r\nwith brusqueness, “Now you see why I’m so anxious to get back! For my\r\nown part, it wouldn’t matter so much, but I can’t help thinking it\r\nmust be Hell for those waiting up there!” And he concluded by drawing\r\nvivid pictures of blue-eyed Martha, his wife, and of the auburn-haired\r\nsix-year-old Ellen, who was waiting for the father that would never\r\ncome back.\r\n\r\nTo all this I listened earnestly; and when Gavison had finished, I\r\ntried to say whatever I could by way of consolation. And in order\r\nto make his woes seem less by comparison, I exaggerated my own; I\r\ndiscoursed upon the misfortune of being sundered from my old father and\r\nmother (who, as a matter of fact, had previously been sundered from me\r\nby death), and dilated upon my grief at losing Alma Huntley--although,\r\nto tell the truth, she had been almost driven out of my thoughts by the\r\nproximity of one even fairer than she.\r\n\r\nIt was from the time of our mutual confessions that my real friendship\r\nwith Gavison dated. Not unnaturally, we now lost sight of our former\r\npositions as superior officer and subordinate, and began to act\r\nunrestrainedly toward one another as man to man. And while I was on\r\nterms of fellowship with all the crew and intimate with several, my\r\nattachment to Gavison became the closest of all; and often of an\r\nafternoon, when he had completed the day’s studies, or of an evening\r\nbefore the great golden orbs had been extinguished, we might have been\r\nseen strolling together along the winding colonnades, or seated on\r\nseaweed cushions in a marble hall, discussing the art or the odd ways\r\nof Atlantis, practicing the Atlantean speech, exchanging reminiscences\r\nof the world we had left, or merely absorbed in one of those long\r\nsilences that marked our queer acquaintanceship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                  The Pageant of the Good Destruction\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile my intimacy with Captain Gavison was ripening, I had of course\r\nnot forgotten one whose friendship meant more to me than that of any\r\nman. In the exhilarating moments of that first happy interview with\r\nAelios, I had had visions of speaking with her often, visions of an\r\nAtlantis made bright by her very presence. But before long I began to\r\nfeel that I had been too sanguine. Although I still caught glimpses\r\nof her when she came to give Stranahan his daily lesson, and although\r\nshe would sometimes nod ingratiatingly to me, it was long before I\r\nhad another opportunity to speak to her, since I could not detach her\r\nfrom the company of the other tutors. And so day after long uneasy day\r\ndragged by until they had piled up into a week, and slow, protracted\r\nweeks until they had accumulated into a month, before at last we had\r\nanother conversation.\r\n\r\nThen came a day when I observed her by chance in one of the great\r\nfestooned courts at the base of a towering campanile. She saw me even\r\nbefore I saw her; and approaching of her own volition, she flashed upon\r\nme a smile that seemed to make the universe stand still with joy. “I\r\nam glad to see you, my friend,” she said, simply and with unaffected\r\nkindliness. “I have been wanting to tell you about our coming pageant.\r\nI know you will not want to miss it, for it will explain many things\r\nyou have been wondering about.”\r\n\r\n“What pageant do you mean?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The Festival of the Good Destruction,” she explained. “Every year, as\r\nI believe I’ve told you, we hold a celebration on the anniversary of\r\nthe Submergence. This year it will take the form of a pageant. It will\r\nbe the Three Thousand and Thirty-fifth anniversary.”\r\n\r\n“In eight days. It will commence at noon in the Agripides Theatre,\r\nwhich you will very easily find, since it is in the center of town. I\r\ncertainly hope to see you there.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly hope to see you there,” I declared, quite truthfully.\r\nBut at the same time a shadow crossed my thoughts. Hesitatingly, and\r\npossibly blushing in my embarrassment, I had to confess that, after\r\nall, I would not be able to go.\r\n\r\n“Not be able to go?” she demanded, in manifest disappointment. “What\r\nother engagement can you possibly have?”\r\n\r\nSince some definite excuse appeared to be necessary, I explained--very\r\nreluctantly to be sure--that I could not pay my admission.\r\n\r\n“Pay your admission?” echoed Aelios, in such shrill surprise that I\r\nthought she had misunderstood me. “What on earth are you thinking of?\r\nDo you imagine we are barbarians?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I haven’t made myself clear,” I hastened to explain. “Where\r\nI come from it is customary to pay upon going to a theatre.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” demanded Aelios, so incredulously that I thought her most\r\nnaïve.\r\n\r\n“Of course!” I assured her, in such a manner as to stamp all doubt from\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\n“How queer!” she exclaimed. “How very queer! Still, I do remember\r\nhearing that people used to have to pay for everything before the\r\nSubmergence. But that was so long ago, I thought the world had outgrown\r\nsuch crudity.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see anything wrong about paying for what you get,” I stated,\r\nthinking this the most topsy-turvy land in the world. “Don’t they\r\nreally charge you for going to theatres down here?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not! How could any one be so gross? Fancy being charged for\r\nbeauty or ecstasy or dreams! Why, one would as soon think of paying\r\nfor the air one breathes or the light that shines upon one! The State\r\nnaturally recognizes the theatre as the birthright of every citizen,\r\njust as it recognizes poetry and music and education. We all take part\r\nin giving the performances, and of course every one is invited.”\r\n\r\n“And do you yourself take part?” I queried, my personal interest in\r\nAelios overshadowing my general interest in the native customs.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I try to do my share,” she acknowledged, with a faint blush\r\nthat seemed only to accentuate her beauty. “I sometimes lead in the\r\ndances.”\r\n\r\n“And a most exquisite dancer you make!” said I, recalling my first\r\nenchanting glimpse of Aelios on the colonnade outside the city.\r\n\r\nBut before I had had time for further compliments, she had whispered a\r\nlight “Good-bye,” and had gone tripping toward the further end of the\r\ncourt and out of sight through a little half concealed door at the base\r\nof the campanile.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt hardly need be stated that I waited eagerly for the day of the\r\nPageant. Not that I was looking forward to the entertainment itself;\r\nI remembered only that Aelios had seen fit to invite me, and that I\r\nshould be able to see her again. So utterly out of my head was I that\r\nher bright face now appeared to me at all times of the day and night;\r\nher least smile, her slightest gesture, her most careless nod, was\r\nre-enacted a thousand times in my memory. And what if somewhere in the\r\npast there had been an Alma Huntley whom I had admired and fancied I\r\nhad loved?--she was now no more than a ghost amid the shadows of a\r\nvanished world.\r\n\r\nCertainly, I had no thought of Alma when at last the day of the pageant\r\narrived. I was jubilant merely at the prospect of speaking with\r\nAelios again; I could hardly restrain my impatience, but left for the\r\nfestivities a full hour earlier than necessary. Such was my eagerness\r\nthat I could not even walk at a normal pace, but unconsciously hastened\r\nmy steps as when, in my native land, I had feared to miss a street car\r\nor be too late for an appointment with Alma.\r\n\r\nBut the day’s pleasure was to be unexpectedly varied. As I hastened\r\nthrough the streets, striding more rapidly than ever before in this\r\nland of leisure, I heard a well known voice shouting behind me, “Hey,\r\nwait a minute! Where are you going so fast?”\r\n\r\nWith a sinking heart I wheeled about--to face the grinning Stranahan.\r\n\r\n“Great Jerusalem, you were racing so I could hardly catch up!” he\r\npanted, as he joined me. “Where you bound for, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Where are you bound for?” I countered.\r\n\r\n“To the pageant, of course,” he informed me. And, amiably unconscious\r\nthat he might be interfering with my plans, he suggested, “Well, we\r\nboth seem to be going in the same direction, so what do you say to\r\ngoing together?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, let’s go together,” I had to acquiesce; and so it happened that\r\nStranahan and I reached the Agripides Theatre arm in arm.\r\n\r\nAs I might have known, we were much too early; the doors were open,\r\nbut the audience had scarcely begun to arrive. Indeed, the whole\r\nenormous open-air theatre was occupied only by a few children who\r\ndanced and played about the stage and romped from tier to tier of the\r\nseaweed-cushioned marble seats.\r\n\r\nUpon entering, we paused for a view of the giant theatre, which\r\nseemed large enough to accommodate an entire community, and which\r\nwas constructed with a simple and yet majestic art that I thought\r\nadmirable. The seat arrangement was that of the typical Greek theatre,\r\nbut the stage surprised me, not only by its size but by its general\r\nappearance, for it was not less than two or three acres in extent,\r\nand was completely enclosed by a ring of columns bearing a dome\r\napparently inlaid with ebony and gold. But what particularly caught my\r\nattention was an object which was evidently not an integral part of the\r\nbuilding--an amorphous mass many feet in height and covering more than\r\nhalf of the stage, but completely mantled in a linen-like white cloth\r\nthat was like a garment of mystery.\r\n\r\nBut Stranahan would brook not more than a moment’s pause for viewing\r\nthe building. Impetuously he started down the steeply sloping central\r\naisle, and did not halt until he had reached the front row, where\r\nhe appropriated the best seat as nonchalantly as though it had been\r\nreserved for him. Of course, I had no choice except to deposit myself\r\nat his side; but I could not help wishing that he had chosen a less\r\nconspicuous position.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the theatre began to fill. Singly and in whole\r\nfamily groups the people were arriving, children and gray old men and\r\nbright-faced girls and youths; and all wore happy, expectant smiles,\r\nand all were clad in their pastel-tinted gowns that made them look\r\nlike animated flowers. I had a chance now to observe the Atlanteans as\r\nnever before; and, as never before, I was struck by the exceptional\r\nnumber of well formed and beautiful faces; by the fact that every one\r\nseemed tranquil and contented, and that there was little if any sign of\r\ntragedy or sorrow. Here was no evidence of the worn and withered, the\r\ndistorted, the grotesque, the wolfish, the weasel and the bovine types\r\nso common on earth; even the old seemed to wear a sweet and placid and\r\nat times a beautiful look, which contrasted strangely with the sour and\r\ncrochety expression I had regarded as natural; and most of the faces\r\nbore the imprint of something akin to poetry and music, an exalted\r\nsomething that I had first noted in Aelios and that set the Atlanteans\r\napart from every other race I had ever known.\r\n\r\nEven to be among these people seemed to produce a strange and uplifting\r\neffect upon me. I do not know what mysterious psychic currents were\r\nat work, and I cannot say that my imagination did not betray me; but\r\nI do distinctly remember that, as the theatre gradually filled, a\r\nsingular sense of well-being and almost of thankfulness came upon\r\nme, a feeling of spiritual tranquility and repose, as though by some\r\nsubtle transference of thought I had shared the mood of the multitude\r\nand become one with them in heart. Even Stranahan seemed to have been\r\naffected, for he had none of his usual boisterousness; he talked but\r\nlittle, and there was a rapt and almost devout look in his eyes, as\r\nthough he too had caught the glimmer of some rare loveliness.\r\n\r\nYet there was still a shadow across my happiness--and possibly across\r\nhis as well. As I scanned the faces that thronged down the aisles and\r\nalong the tiers of seats, there was one smiling countenance for which\r\nI searched in vain. Surely, Aelios had not forgotten the day, nor had\r\nshe forgotten her implied promise to see me here; yet till the last\r\nseat was filled by the expectant crowd, I scrutinized the faces of the\r\nnewcomers, only to be assured that Aelios was not among them.\r\n\r\nBut after about an hour, my thoughts were forcibly recalled from\r\nAelios to the spectacle in the great theatre. A sudden flickering\r\nof the great golden orbs attracted our attention; and we noted that\r\nthose luminaries were being dimmed as though by unseen hands until\r\nthey had less than half their usual brightness. At the same time, long\r\nshafts of light began to shoot out simultaneously from all points of\r\nthe horizon,--multicolored shafts that included all the hues of the\r\nrainbow. In wide ambling curves they met the dark glass of the roof,\r\nsplashing it with red and purple, orange and green, lavender and\r\nviolet; and for many minutes the play and interplay of color continued,\r\nthe searchlights seeming to work out all manner of patterns and\r\narabesques which endured for a moment and vanished.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe one thing to which I could liken this pageant of light was the\r\nmusic that sometimes preceded theatrical performances in our own land.\r\nThe flashing colors had all the ethereal loveliness of music; and like\r\nmusic they prepared one for a mood of rapture and contemplation. And\r\nwhen at length the original lights had faded out, to be replaced by\r\nothers that shone directly down upon the open platform or stage, this\r\nmood was strengthened and intensified; and at the same time I felt that\r\nwe had but beheld an introduction to the real exhibition.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the illumination of the many-hued searchlights, a\r\nwhite-gowned woman appeared upon the stage. She was very young,\r\nscarcely more than a girl, I thought, and her face had something of\r\nthat sweetness and radiance which distinguished Aelios; while in the\r\ncolored glow of the everchanging lights she seemed some shimmering,\r\nethereal thing, possibly a butterfly, possibly some apparition as\r\nunreal as rainbows or moonlit cloud.\r\n\r\nI was surprised, accordingly, when the fairy-like creature began to\r\nspeak. Or perhaps it would not be correct to say that she spoke; her\r\nwords came in a soft, wonderfully melodious voice more than half like\r\nsong; and merely to listen to her was to be lulled and soothed as\r\nthough by music.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the spirit of exaltation and almost of worship she aroused\r\nin me, I did not miss the drift of what she was saying.\r\n\r\n“Fellow citizens,” she declared, while a hush came over the assemblage,\r\nand all strained forward so as to lose not a syllable, “fellow\r\ncitizens, for this year’s celebration we have decided to present a\r\nhistorical pageant. Imagine yourselves borne backward almost thirty-one\r\nhundred years, to those days when the Submergence was not yet an\r\naccomplished fact, and Agripides stood before the old National Assembly\r\nurging the Good Destruction. Agripides shall now appear before you, as\r\nhe appeared to your forefathers in the lands above the sea; you shall\r\nbe the National Assembly before which he speaks; and he shall present\r\nhis views to you as he presented them to our ancestors, and depict for\r\nyou, as he depicted for them, the reasons why Atlantis should become a\r\nsunken continent. Behold, here comes Agripides!”\r\n\r\nWith a wide-sweeping bow the speaker ceased, retreating from view\r\nthrough some unseen door; and at the same instant some invisible\r\ninstrument sent forth a sound like a trumpet blast, and from the rear\r\nof the stage a tall figure appeared, walking slowly and with head bent\r\nlow as though in thought.\r\n\r\n“Agripides! Agripides!” came one or two indistinct murmurs from behind\r\nme, but there was no such tumult of applause as I might have expected.\r\nYet all eyes were directed eagerly toward the newcomer, and I found\r\nmyself a partner in the tense excitement of the multitude.\r\n\r\nEven had I not heard the name Agripides, I should have recognized the\r\nadvancing figure from the bust shown me by Aelios--there was the same\r\nbearded countenance, the same broad and noble brow, the same furrowed\r\nand sympathetic features. But one characteristic there was which the\r\nbust could not show, and which, while merely incidental, struck me\r\nwith peculiar force. The garments of Agripides were not gay-hued, like\r\nthose of modern Atlanteans, but were of a deep and somber brown; and\r\nthey clung to his body so closely as apparently to interfere with his\r\nwalking, and to make him look disquietingly like an animated corpse.\r\n\r\nBut I forgot all such irrelevant impressions the moment that\r\nAgripides--or, rather, his living representative--had uttered his\r\nfirst word. “Fellow members of the National Assembly,” said he, with\r\na low bow, while in the audience an awed silence held sway, “for\r\nthe hundredth time I address you on the subject of the proposed\r\nSubmergence. And for the hundredth time I remind you that we have no\r\nchoice in the matter: it is a question of the submergence either of the\r\nland of Atlantis or of its soul. Let me prove this to you, Members of\r\nthe Assembly; let me show you how near the soul of Atlantis already is\r\nto submergence. Watch carefully as a stream of typical present-day men\r\nand women passes by.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker ceased, and from invisible corridors on both sides of the\r\nstage came a noise as of shuffled feet, chattering voices, horns and\r\nbells and clattering wheels. “By the Holy Father, if we’re not back in\r\nthe old U. S. A.!” muttered Stranahan so loud that many of the audience\r\ncould hear him; and he leaned so far forward that I feared he would\r\nfall over the railing into the stage.\r\n\r\nBut the spectacle before us was so engrossing as to make me forget\r\neven Stranahan’s absurd conduct. Very quickly I came to agree that\r\nAtlantis before the Submergence must indeed have been hideous; I had\r\nnever known anything quite so ugly as the scene we now witnessed. From\r\nboth sides of the stage a slow procession of men and women began to\r\nfile, the two streams passing each other and trailing out in opposite\r\ndirections; and the faces and figures of the people were the most\r\nrepulsive I had ever seen. Some were so lean and scrawny as to remind\r\nme of walking skeletons; others, fat and bloated, waddled along like\r\nliving caricatures with scarcely the power of self-locomotion; and the\r\nmajority had an unnaturally sallow, flushed or mottled complexion that\r\nseemed to set them off as a species apart. And their clothes were in\r\naccord with their appearance; they were all clad in a drab brown or\r\nblack, some with a peculiar steely color that encircled their chins\r\nand ears, some with strange metallic waist-bands that prevented them\r\nfrom turning in any direction, some with ornamental brass spikes that\r\nelevated the soles of their feet inches above their heels and converted\r\ntheir walking into a form of hobbling.\r\n\r\nBut what chiefly interested me were the faces of the people. Not a few,\r\nwith heavy paunches, and baggy, feeble cheeks, reminded me of nothing\r\nso much as of a certain bristly domestic beast; not a few others had\r\nfeatures grotesquely like those of baboons, bears, wolves, foxes,\r\nweasels, or tigers. And a majority looked like nothing so much as the\r\nprey of tigers, weasels, and foxes. Their eyes had a hunted expression,\r\nand their whole manner was one of timidity; they seemed continually\r\nconfused and frightened and ready to run at any sound, and yet had\r\nsomething of the cowed look of creatures beaten into resigned despair.\r\n\r\nAll the while, as they proceeded across the stage, they produced a\r\nperfect pandemonium of squeaks, grunts, hoots, rumblings, howlings,\r\nand snarlings, some seeming quite familiar to me, others sounding like\r\nvoices of the wilderness. The acting, I thought, was marvelous; it\r\nwas executed so perfectly that for the time I had quite forgotten it\r\nwas acting at all. Hearing the uproar and looking at the dark-robed,\r\ndistorted multitude, I could not but think by contrast of Aelios and\r\nthe grace and beauty that surrounded her; and I missed her even more\r\nkeenly than before, and wondered impatiently if I should not yet see\r\nher at the pageant.\r\n\r\nAt length, to my relief, the last of the uncouth mob had gone trooping\r\noff the stage, and only the tall figure of Agripides remained. “Members\r\nof the Assembly,” resumed the statesman, after all had again become\r\nquiet, “you have now had a close view of our typical citizens. Do you\r\nnot believe them more deeply submerged than if a thousand fathoms of\r\nwater rolled above them? Or if you are not yet convinced, let me show\r\nyou these people in their normal occupations.”\r\n\r\nAs though at a prearranged signal, three or four huge instruments,\r\nwith long segmented oblong belts moving on wheels, were dragged to\r\nthe center of the stage by half-invisible wires. I recognized these\r\nmachines as curious forms of treadmills, for on each of the belts a man\r\nhad been deposited, and each, man was forcing his legs back and forth\r\nat tremendous speed, as though running in a desperate hurry. But no\r\nmatter how furiously they worked, all the men remained in exactly the\r\nsame place, for the belts slid backward precisely as fast as their feet\r\npressed forward.\r\n\r\n“Saints in heaven,” opined Stranahan, with a puzzled frown, “they’d get\r\nthere just as fast if they took their time!”\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two the treadmills were pulled off the stage and\r\nAgripides again briefly addressed the audience. “My friends,” said he,\r\n“I will now illustrate for you another of the leading occupations of\r\nour times.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI do not know what rare art of stagecraft was then applied, for\r\nas if by magic a bright bed of flowers sprang to life before us,\r\nand long-stemmed purple and yellow blossoms resembling tulips and\r\nhollyhocks waved above some retiring white-budding plant reminding me\r\nof the violet. But I was to be disappointed if I expected anything\r\nbeautiful to follow. From one side of the stage came a series of oaths,\r\ngrowls, curses, shrieks, hisses, and mutterings, gradually increasing\r\nin fierceness and volume; and soon an amorphous mass of squirming,\r\ntwisting, embattled men writhed into view. I could not tell how many\r\nof them there were, except that they were numbered by the dozen; and I\r\ncould not determine what they looked like, except that they were all\r\nsoberly attired. But it was as if a storm had been let loose among\r\nthem; they were literally tumbling over one another, wrestling with the\r\nferocity of lions, snatching violently at one another’s arms, legs and\r\nnecks, until they seemed little more than a blur of convulsive, wildly\r\nagitated trunks and limbs.\r\n\r\n“Holy Methuselah, it’s a new kind of football!” cried Stranahan,\r\nexcitedly, as he craned his long neck far forward for a better view of\r\nthe contest.\r\n\r\nBut before I had time to chide Stranahan on this senseless outburst, I\r\nwas occupied by a new observation. The struggling men were advancing\r\nacross the stage, and slowly intruding upon the flower beds. But none\r\nseemed to notice, and the pandemonium continued until the actors were\r\nbeating down the flowers on all sides and not a hollyhock or tulip or\r\nviolet remained.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly one of the men was thrust out of the wild multitude, and\r\nlay on the ground as if dead, his clothes ripped and torn, his body\r\ngashed and bleeding. But no one seemed to notice him, and his shrieks\r\nand howls rang forth until another had been flung aside with broken\r\nlimbs, and then another, and then another. In the end only two remained\r\nstanding, both grappling desperately for a little metallic disk that\r\nglittered a deep yellow. With bestial snarls and screeches they\r\nwrestled over this trinket; and at length, still wrestling, and with\r\nfaces blood-red and distorted, they tumbled, moaning, off the stage.\r\n\r\nAfter this exhibition there was silence for several minutes. I was\r\nglad when at length Agripides seemed to feel that his audience was\r\nready for a change of mood, and again took the center of the stage.\r\n\r\n“Members of the National Assembly,” he said, “you have now observed\r\nmodern life in two of its more common phases. You will find something\r\nno less familiar in the third phase, which I am about to present to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThis time a gigantic clattering black machine was rolled on to the\r\nstage by some unseen power, its innumerable wheels and belts and\r\nchains in rapid motion, some of them moving so swiftly as to look\r\nlike whirring shadows. But it was not the speed or smoothness of its\r\naction that made the mechanism remarkable: all about its side, in a\r\nlong, even row, stood scores of grime-faced and sooty men, their feet\r\nclamped to the ground by iron vises, their arms fastened by long rods\r\nto the wheels above. And all the while those rods were moving, moving\r\nwith rhythmic, clock-like regularity, moving unceasingly up and down,\r\npulling the arms of the men with them, first the right arm and then the\r\nleft, then again the right and then the left, as though they had done\r\nso for all eternity and would continue to do so for all eternity.\r\n\r\n“The devil take me,” muttered Stranahan, who had to have his way, “It\r\nain’t the men that work the machines! It’s the machines that work the\r\nmen!”\r\n\r\nI am afraid that Stranahan’s remarks diverted my attention and made\r\nme miss part of the performance, for when next I turned my eyes to\r\nthe stage, the scene was much changed. A great claw-like steel device\r\nwas reaching out from the interior of the machine, seizing one of the\r\nmen, wrenching him from his position as though he had been a misplaced\r\nscrew, and casting him bleeding to the floor. And while he lay there\r\nmoaning and helpless, a clamor of shouts was heard from off stage,\r\nand a score of tattered men came rushing in and threw themselves down\r\nbefore the machine as if in reverence. And, as though endowed with\r\nintelligence, the machine seemed to hear, for it reached out the same\r\ngreat claw-like hand, clutched one of the men at random, and thrust him\r\ninto the place of the rejected one. And now the arms of the newcomer\r\nbegan to work up and down, up and down unremittingly, accompanying the\r\nsteel rods in the same even and automatic fashion as the arms of his\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nThe next feature on the program was a long oration delivered in\r\nAgripides’ most celebrated words; following which the actor prepared\r\nthe way for the climax by a few explanatory comments. “Members of the\r\nNational Assembly,” said he, still using phrases first uttered three\r\nthousand years before, “I wish you to look carefully at Axios, which,\r\nas you know, is one of the leading commercial cities of our age. First\r\ngaze upon its domes and towers as they are now familiar to you; then\r\nbehold them as they will be when the unleashed waters of the Atlantic\r\ncome sweeping across them; then open your eyes wide for a foreglimpse\r\nof our land in the golden era after the Submergence.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven as the last words were uttered, my attention was drawn to the\r\nhuge amorphous mass which lay cloaked in white linen at one side of\r\nthe stage. Invisible hands seemed to take hold of the covering; slowly\r\nit was lifted into the air, then slowly pulled to one side and out of\r\nsight. At first I could only gape in astonishment--the strangest of all\r\nconceivable things was being unbared! Distinctly I was reminded of the\r\npaintings I had seen in various of the halls of Archeon--that which\r\nstared before me was a city in miniature, but a city such as I would\r\nhave expected no Atlantean to conceive. Not the faintest resemblance\r\ndid it bear to this undersea realm of statue-like temples and\r\nmany-columned palaces; rather, it was like a city of the modern world.\r\nRow upon unbending row of box-like edifices, apparently of granite\r\nor brick, loomed at irregular heights and with flat, ungarnished\r\nroofs; tier after tier of little oblong windows looked out from the\r\nsmoke-stained sides of the towers; slender defiles, so narrow that they\r\nreminded one of light-wells, separated the opposing ranks of masonry;\r\nand at the base of these dreary gray pits swarmed masses of dark-robed\r\nmen and women, jammed together so compactly that one wondered if they\r\nwere not standing on each other’s toes.\r\n\r\n“By the Blessed Mother, if it ain’t little old New York!” stuttered\r\nStranahan, nudging me knowingly in the side.\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, I was startled by a noise as of a thunder clap.\r\nAnd the next instant, the midget men and women scattered pellmell,\r\nvanishing through little openings in the walls. Meanwhile the thunder\r\nclaps continued, loud-rumbling and resonant, one crash pealing and\r\nreverberating before the echoes of the last had died away; and\r\nminiature lightnings darted and flared from the great greenish vault\r\nabove. As the display proceeded, it grew constantly brighter and more\r\nvivid; and I was wondering what the sequel would be, when suddenly\r\nthere came a blast so loud that I clapped my hands to my ears in\r\nterror. Simultaneously a brilliant blade of light seemed to cut\r\ndagger-like through the buildings, wrapping them momentarily in a sheet\r\nof flame; the walls seemed to be heaving and trembling as though in an\r\nearthquake’s claws, and there came to my ears a rattling and crashing\r\nas of falling masonry.\r\n\r\nThen, while the clamor increased and the buildings heaved and wavered\r\nwith the motion of tossing ships at sea, the ground beneath them gave\r\na sharp lunge downward; and like toy castles, the towers all at once\r\ncollapsed, some falling over their neighbors in crashing confusion,\r\nsome shaken into great dusty piles of mortar and stone, some stripped\r\nof their walls yet still standing with gaunt contorted ribs of steel,\r\nsome bursting into flame that glared and crackled fiendishly and poured\r\nout dense, black spirals of smoke.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had the thunder of the overthrown walls died down when a\r\nnew and more ominous roaring came to my ears, a tumult as of Niagara or\r\nof sea-waves splashing the cliffs. Out of the great earthen basin into\r\nwhich the ruined city had subsided, there issued a foaming confusion\r\nof waters, as though a reservoir had burst its dam; and from all sides\r\na white-flecked torrent came plunging down upon the wrecked towers,\r\nstruggling and storming above their lower stories as if to wash them\r\nutterly away. And it seemed that they were to have their will, for the\r\ntowers were sinking, visibly sinking beneath the waves. Heap after\r\ngigantic heap of debris dipped its head into the waters and was lost\r\nto view; edifice after looming edifice, dismantled and battered, was\r\nengulfed by the insatiable flood. And now the fires no longer burned\r\nand the smoke no longer soared; now only two or three tortured steel\r\ncolumns reached out of the indifferent sea; now only one was left,\r\none lean and crooked metallic shaft like the agonized clutching hand\r\nof a drowning man. But soon even this had slipped from view, and the\r\nfrothy-tongued, deep-blue waters gave no sign that a city had ever\r\nbarred their path.\r\n\r\nAnd as the last trace of old Atlantis vanished, a grayness as of\r\ntwilight suffused the scene; the golden lights became dim, and dimmer\r\nstill, until they had fluttered out altogether, and blackness blotted\r\nall things from our gaze.\r\n\r\nBut as we sat there spellbound in the dark, feeling like men who had\r\nbeheld the end of all things, there came on airy change to break the\r\ndreariness of our mood. From far, far away, apparently whole worlds\r\naway, issued a faint tinkling music, more like the song of elves than\r\nof any mortal being. It was half like the loveliness that one hears in\r\ndreams, and more than half like the remote ghostly melodies borne to\r\none across the wind; but gradually it grew nearer, gradually louder\r\nand more distinct, although its ethereal and fairy-like quality still\r\nremained. At length I recognized that it proceeded from a chorus of\r\nvoices, a wonderfully sweet womanly chorus whose members may have been\r\nhuman but who seemed little less than angelic. For it was with a divine\r\nexaltation that they sang, and their tones were the tones of immortal\r\nsweetness and hope, and they seemed to assure me that all was well with\r\nthe world and with life, and that beauty and happiness must triumph.\r\n\r\nAs the singing continued, the darkness was gradually dispersed; yet the\r\ngreat orb above did not resume the full brightness of the Atlantean\r\nday, but remained subdued to a rose-tinged twilight glow. And in\r\nthat twilight a troop of shimmering-gowned dancing maidens appeared,\r\nswinging from side to side with superbly harmonious movements of arm\r\nand waist and ankle until they seemed not so much individual dancers as\r\nparts of the eternal rhythm of the universe. But whether the singing\r\nproceeded from them or from persons unseen was more than I could\r\njudge; for just then my eye was caught by the leader of the dancers,\r\nand my thoughts were as if paralyzed. As she glided from side to side\r\nwith movements like music, she smiled a gloriously sweet smile; and\r\nthat smile seemed to be bent full upon me, though here my imagination\r\nmay have borne false reports. But with furiously thumping heart and\r\na surging of something dangerously like tenderness, I realized that\r\nAelios had kept her promise to see me at the pageant.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Then, while the clamor increased and the buildings\r\nheaved and wavered with the motion of tossing ships at sea, the ground\r\nbeneath them gave a sharp lunge downward; and like toy castles, the\r\ntowers all at once collapsed.... But scarcely had the thunder of the\r\noverthrown walls died down, when a new and more ominous roaring came to\r\nmy ears, a tumult as of Niagara or of sea-waves splashing the cliffs...]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                          An Official Summons\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or four days after the pageant, I was surprised to receive a\r\nvisitor in the shape of a serious-looking gray old man whom I did\r\nnot remember ever having seen before. In his hand he bore a little\r\nblue-sealed parchment scroll, on which my name had been inscribed in\r\nthe native language; and by his grave manner, and particularly by\r\nthe significant way in which he held the document, I feared that his\r\nmission might prove of ominous importance.\r\n\r\nMy first impression was that I had unwittingly violated some local\r\nlaw, and was being summoned to court to answer for the crime. But this\r\nfear was swiftly dissipated. “I congratulate you, young man,” said my\r\nvisitor, having determined that I was the person he sought. “This is an\r\noccasion such as comes but once in a lifetime.” And with a sedate and\r\ndeferential air, and apparently not surmising that the nature of his\r\nmission was still a mystery to me, he passed the little document to me;\r\nfollowing which he congratulated me again, and solemnly bowed his way\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\nI now suspected that I was either the recipient of some high honor or\r\nthe appointee to some responsible office. It is no wonder, accordingly,\r\nthat my fingers trembled when I ripped open the blue seal, and that\r\nin my eagerness I almost tore the parchment as well. But again my\r\nexpectations were to prove ill-founded. The message turned out to be\r\nvery brief; and, far from providing cause either for exultation or\r\ndismay, it served merely to puzzle me.\r\n\r\n“To the respected Anson Harkness,” ran the words, which were handsomely\r\nformed in the native script, “the Committee on Selective Assignments\r\nwishes to announce that it is ready for the hearings and examinations\r\nin his case. If he will therefore be so kind as to present himself at\r\nthe Committee offices any noon during the next ten days, he may be\r\nassured that the investigations will be carried out with a minimum of\r\ndelay and a decision promptly rendered.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was all, except for the signature of the Head of the\r\nCommittee! Not a word as to what the Selective Assignments might be!\r\nNot a word as to the nature of the “hearings and examinations!” Time\r\nafter time I re-read this queer message, scrutinizing it until I had\r\nmemorized it in its entirety; but the more I read the more perplexed I\r\nbecame, and I could almost believe myself the target of some practical\r\njoker. Just what was to be investigated? And what decision was to be\r\nreached? Was it that my conduct was thought improper and was to be\r\nreviewed? That I was considered too scornful of local customs, or too\r\nfriendly to Aelios? Or--judging from the congratulatory manner of\r\nthe gray-haired one--was I somehow deemed worthy of reward, possibly\r\nthrough the connivance of Aelios? Or was I to be examined as prize\r\nscholars are sometimes examined before being granted a scholarship?\r\n\r\nTo confess the truth, none of these possibilities appeared very\r\ncredible to me. But I could think of nothing more plausible, and at\r\nlength was forced to recognize that the mystery was too deep for my\r\npenetration. The only reasonable course would be to consult one of\r\nthe natives, who could doubtless answer all my questions without any\r\ntrouble. And since I was acquainted with only one of the natives\r\nbesides my tutor, and since it would give me particular pleasure to\r\nconsult that one, I decided that, if possible, I should refer the\r\nbaffling document to Aelios.\r\n\r\nBut how to isolate Aelios long enough for a conversation was in itself\r\na problem. After some thought, however, I conceived an idea which\r\nseemed promising: if I could determine where Aelios lived and then pay\r\nher a visit, I might solve the mystery of the Selective Assignments at\r\nthe same time as I made possible a closer intimacy with Aelios herself.\r\n\r\nYet it was only by a severe effort that I found the courage to carry\r\nout my plans----to follow Aelios one afternoon after the conclusion of\r\nher day’s instruction. Through innumerable curving lanes and avenues\r\nI trailed her and her fellow tutors, pressing close to the columns\r\nand the walls of the building, like a detective tracking his prey. At\r\nlength, when we seemed to be approaching the outskirts of the city,\r\nAelios waved a pleasant farewell to her companions, and started off\r\nalone down a little path bordered by a deep-red geranium-like flower.\r\nThinking this to be my opportunity, I hastened my footsteps; but\r\nbefore I could overtake her she had reached the end of the path, and,\r\nquite oblivious of my approach, had entered the arching doorway of a\r\nhouse--or, should I call it a palace?--with curving convex walls of the\r\ncolor of pearl.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes I stood wavering without. And it was in half-timid\r\nhesitancy, that at lest I forced my feet to the threshold and urged my\r\nhands to rap at the violet stained-glass panels of the door.\r\n\r\nIt was but a minute before the sound of approaching footsteps notified\r\nme that I had not knocked in vain. But in that minute I was swept by\r\nwild hopes and still wilder torments and regrets. Would it be Aelios\r\nherself that answered me? Or would it be some member of her family,\r\npossibly her mother or father, or else a sister almost as charming as\r\nherself? And, if so, what should I say? and on what business pretend to\r\nseek a conference with Aelios?\r\n\r\nWhile I was wrapped in such thoughts, the door swung open, and I found\r\nmyself face to face--not with Aelios, nor with her mother or father,\r\nnor with a sister of hers! But a young man of perhaps twenty-five,\r\nbroad-browed and sparkling-eyed like most of the Atlanteans, stood\r\nlooking inquiringly out at me.\r\n\r\n“Is this--is this where Aelios lives?” I gasped, in embarrassment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Aelios lives here,” he returned, in matter-of-fact tones. And\r\nthen, with a winning smile, “You would like to see her?”\r\n\r\nI admitted that he had surmised correctly, and was relieved to be\r\nadmitted into the house without further questioning. Having passed\r\nthrough a broad hallway or vestibule illumined by large, swinging\r\norange-colored lamps, we entered a daintily tapestried sitting room\r\nfeatured by lanterns of pale blue. The young man bade me be seated on\r\nthe seaweed-decorated sofa, and then left me momentarily to myself; and\r\nin that brief snatch of solitude I found myself assailed by storms of\r\njealous questions. Who was the young man? And in what relationship did\r\nhe stand to Aelios? Was he perchance some suitor of hers? Or was he\r\nmerely her brother? Or was it possible--oh, unspeakable thought!--that\r\nshe was already married, and that this was her husband?\r\n\r\nAt the latter reflection I experienced in advance all the pangs of\r\nunsuccessful love. My head swam with senseless fury; I was weighed\r\ndown with anticipatory despair, and saw myself the victim of hopes\r\nthat could never be fulfilled. I had just reached the darkest point\r\nof my broodings, and was just telling myself that of course I could\r\nnever attract so admirable a woman as Aelios, when I heard a well known\r\nmelodious voice murmuring, “What is the matter today, my friend? What\r\nare you so depressed about?”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRecalled from my dejection as from a bad dream, I sprang up to take the\r\nhand of Aelios, who was smiling as graciously as though my visit had\r\nbeen expected and even welcomed.\r\n\r\nBut what I next said I cannot recall. No doubt it was some bit of\r\nnonsense not worth repeating; indeed, it would perhaps have been some\r\nbit of sentimental nonsense, had I not recalled the existence of the\r\nunknown young man. But since I was too diffident to inquire who he\r\nmight be, and since the thought of him remained with me in spite of\r\nAelios’ kindness, I refrained from all sentimental advances in this,\r\nour first private meeting. It is true, that whenever her blue eyes\r\nflashed, they drew me toward her like twin magnets; it is true, that\r\nwhenever she smiled, her inexpressibly sweet smile, I yearned to dash\r\ndown all barriers in one long fervent confession; yet I was thankful\r\neven to be able to sit side by side with her quietly talking. In the\r\nwide years that separate me now from that brief enchanted interview, my\r\nmemory has lost track of what she said, it merely retains how she said\r\nit; I can recall the sparkling eagerness with which her words poured\r\nforth, like the wavelets of a rapid crystal stream; I can recapture\r\nthe sage nodding and tossing of her head, the ripples of deep feeling\r\nthat passed and repassed on her mobile countenance, the luminescence as\r\nfrom some inner sun that would make her whole face shine as she uttered\r\nsome rare bit of wit or fancy. But I do not even know the subject of\r\nour discussion, except that it was a theme suggested by her and that it\r\nwas impersonal; I only know that it was she who did most of the talking\r\nwhile I looked on in awed worship, and that either she was blind to my\r\nreverence for her or else chose to ignore it.\r\n\r\nIt was not until I rose to leave that my thoughts reverted to the\r\nsubject which had brought me to see Aelios. And then, since the hour\r\nwas late and my mood was no longer prosaic, I did not choose to\r\ndiscuss that topic long. I merely showed Aelios the letter, which she\r\nglanced at briefly and with a broad smile; then she surprised me by\r\ncongratulating me just as the gray-haired bearer of the message had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nBut she was exceedingly chary of information. “If you will go to the\r\nCommittee offices,” she suggested, “the whole matter will be made much\r\nclearer to you than I could make it.” And, after directing me where to\r\nfind the offices, she added, “I’d advise you to waste no time, or else\r\nyou may lose your turn and have to wait another half year. You know,\r\nthat’s what happened once to my cousin Argol, who met you at the door\r\njust before.”\r\n\r\nGenuinely gratified that my doubts about Cousin Argol had been\r\ndispersed, I thanked Aelios and turned to leave. My heart pattered\r\nhappily when I found her accompanying me to the outer door; and I felt\r\nan actual thrill of joy when she pressed her little hand firmly in my\r\ngreat one, and murmured, in tones that could leave no doubt of her\r\nsincerity, “Come again, my friend. Come whenever you wish some one to\r\ntalk with. I shall always be glad to see you.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was with a glow of triumph that I found myself walking down\r\nthe flower-bordered walk toward the main avenue. Aelios was more\r\nfriendly than I had had any reason to expect!--her company was even\r\nmore charming than I had imagined! Considering all things, I had every\r\ncause to be thankful, and who knew but that some day-- But here my\r\nthoughts reached a dazzling veil beyond which I would not allow them to\r\npenetrate, for there were still heights that I could not mount even in\r\nmy most daring fancies.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Some of the trees had branches symmetrically woven into\r\nthe likenesses of great cobwebs, and from those cobwebs at regular\r\nintervals dangled clusters of grape-like fruits; other trees were\r\ncactus-like and leafless; and some of the shrubs and creepers bore\r\npods resembling those of beans and peas, except that they were over a\r\nfoot in length. The vast majority of this strange assemblage of plants\r\nseemed to be fruit-bearing ...]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                          The High Initiation\r\n\r\n\r\nPromptly at noon the following day I presented myself before the\r\nCommittee on Selective Assignments. The offices, which I found without\r\ndifficulty, were located on the lower floor of an imposing blue-tinted\r\ngranite edifice; and the Committee itself occupied a hall reminding me\r\nvaguely of a court-room, except that its ornamental columns and busts\r\nand statues were unparalleled in any court-room I had ever seen. Before\r\na long marble railing sat about fifteen men and women, some old but\r\nseveral conspicuously young. All were perched on cushioned marble seats\r\nbefore little marble pedestals or writing stands, and to their rear\r\nwere cases lined with rows of parchment-bound volumes that lent the\r\nplace a scholarly dignity. In front of them, across the railing, were\r\nhalf a dozen tiers of blue stone benches; and on each of the benches\r\nstood a huge pile of books, as though the spectators were expected to\r\nmake use of their time during any delay in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nBut I was not admitted at once into this great hall. First I was\r\nescorted into a small anteroom, where three Atlanteans--two youths\r\nof about twenty, and a girl of the same age--were seated studiously\r\nreading. From a little parchment document which each carried, I felt\r\nsure that they were here on a mission similar to my own; but so\r\npreoccupied did they seem, that I had no opportunity to question them.\r\nFor a moment I merely stared at them impatiently; then, turning to\r\ninspect the room, I was delighted to observe a pile of little books on\r\na reed stand in one corner.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a single curious glance, I began examining these volumes with\r\nhungry interest. Their very titles proved alluring, far more alluring\r\nthan anything printed I had yet seen in Atlantis, with the exception\r\nof the lost Homeric masterpiece. Some were works of information\r\ndealing with subjects so varied as “Post-Submergence Mural Art,” “The\r\nRise of Government by Selection,” “The Stimulation of Plant Life by\r\nArtificial Sunlight,” “History of the Abolition of Crime,” or “History\r\nof the Decline of the Upper World”; others were essays on such rare\r\ntopics as “The Cultivation of Genius,” “Is Altruism One of the Human\r\nInstincts?” and “How Atlantis Found the World by Losing It”; still\r\nothers were works of literature, and, though I had no time to observe\r\nthem carefully, I saw that they included an epic poem on “Agripides,”\r\na volume of lyrics by some unknown writer of two thousand years ago\r\nas well as selections from a dozen lyricists of the present, a poetic\r\ndrama evidently designed for performance at the annual celebration of\r\nthe Submergence, several novels and a collection of stories, and a\r\nromance of the far future entitled “Super-Art.”\r\n\r\nBut what particularly engaged my attention was a genial little satire\r\nknown as “The Prisoner.” This story, which was written in a crisp and\r\nsimple style that I found delightful, recounted how an Atlantean of a\r\nthousand years before had been sentenced, as the penalty for his sins,\r\nto pass his remaining years in the upper world. Having been sent above\r\nseas in a little water-tight craft propelled by intra-atomic engines,\r\nhe had set about to seek his fortune in his new surroundings; and,\r\nfinding that the way to win distinction was to accumulate much gold,\r\nhe applied his superior Atlantean wits so well that in a short while\r\nhe became fabulously wealthy. But, after attaining what was reputed to\r\nbe success, he discovered that his wealth meant nothing to him; he was\r\nhungry for the art and the beauty of Atlantis, without which the world\r\nseemed barbarous and empty. Even though he could have purchased any\r\ntreasure or luxury on earth, he took to morbid repining; he brooded and\r\nbrooded until he went completely out of his wits, which were finally\r\nrestored to him when the Atlanteans took pity and decided to let him\r\nreturn. And so the poor man went back to his native land, having first\r\nforfeited his riches; and this was the last case of insanity even known\r\namong the Atlanteans.\r\n\r\nI had just completed this little story when I was roused to reality by\r\nhearing a strange voice sonorously pronouncing my name. Looking up,\r\nI saw a lavender-gowned man motioning me toward the main Committee\r\nRoom; and I observed with surprise that the youths and the girl had\r\ndisappeared while I was absorbed in my book.\r\n\r\nI found the central hall empty except for the fifteen men and women\r\nsedately seated behind the railing; but at sight of these grave\r\nindividuals I felt my misgivings returning, and wished that I could\r\nhave been anywhere else in the universe.\r\n\r\n“This is Anson Harkness, is it not?” rang forth the high-pitched\r\nand yet not unpleasant voice of an aged man whose proximity to the\r\nrailing indicated that he was the head of the Committee. And after\r\nI had assured him that I was the person designated, the Head Member\r\ncontinued, earnestly and yet not so menacingly as I had expected, “Be\r\nseated, Anson Harkness. It is an important matter that brings you here.\r\nAnd I believe that, in your case, more than the usual amount of time\r\nand thought will be necessary before we can reach a decision.”\r\n\r\nThe Head Member paused, cleared his throat, and slowly proceeded, “I\r\ntrust that you will co-operate with us to the best of your ability, for\r\nonly so can we expect satisfactory results. Just as the average man\r\nis betrothed but once in his life, so he appears but once before this\r\nCommittee; and since, as in the case of a betrothal, much may depend\r\nupon the proper choice--”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” I interrupted, unable to endure these\r\nlong-winded sentences that only added to my confusion, “Would you mind\r\ntelling me why I am here? As yet I haven’t the faintest idea.”\r\n\r\nThe Head Member peered at me in mild surprise; his fourteen associates\r\ndarted inquiring looks at one another.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, that is a proper question,” he resumed, blandly. “I had\r\nforgotten: you are a foreigner, and are unacquainted with our ways.\r\nYou will understand, of course that foreigners were so totally unknown\r\nbefore your coming that the necessity for explanation had not occurred\r\nto me. However, the whole matter can be made clear in a few words.\r\nYou are summoned for what is known as the High Initiation--in other\r\nwords, this should be the happiest day of your life, since you are now\r\nregarded as having reached maturity and so may set forth upon your\r\ncareer of service to the State.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving been a voter in the United States for the past eleven years,\r\nI was not flattered to be told that I had reached maturity. None the\r\nless, I held my tongue, and listened patiently as the Head Member\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n“The government tutor who has been instructing you,” he pursued, “has\r\nreported that you have at least an elementary knowledge of our language\r\nand customs, and suggests that you be assigned at once to service.\r\nActing upon his recommendation, we intend to promote you to duties\r\nthat accord as nearly as possible with your desires and capabilities.\r\nBut first we must say a word as to the methods in vogue in our land.\r\nEver since the great social revolution which occurred in the second\r\ncentury after the submergence and which for a time threatened to engulf\r\nus in chaos, we have employed what is known as the Beehive System of\r\nlabor--which means that every citizen is required to perform a certain\r\nminimum amount of work for the State in order to accomplish those tasks\r\nindispensable for our continued existence. Fortunately, the utilization\r\nof intra-atomic energy and the elimination of waste and of duplication\r\nof effort have reduced the essential work to one-tenth of that thought\r\nnecessary before the Submergence; and the average citizen now labors\r\nnot more than an hour and a half or two hours a day. There have,\r\nindeed, been occasional men and women so enamored of their employment\r\nas to insist on working four or five hours, but such excessive\r\napplication is not encouraged, for it is believed to overcast the mind\r\nand blunt the esthetic sensibilities.”\r\n\r\n“Then for heaven’s sake,” I burst forth, thinking this country to be\r\nwholly without “push” and energy, “What do people here do with their\r\ntime? If they don’t work, they must be simply bored to death!”\r\n\r\nThe Head Member regarded me with a tolerant smile, as one might regard\r\na lunatic who makes some harmless remark.\r\n\r\n“That is where you misunderstand the meaning of the word work,” he\r\nexplained, with something of the manner of a schoolmaster to a backward\r\npupil. “Our people do work, and work diligently indeed, and sometimes\r\nwork many hours a day--but not on those barren practical duties to\r\nwhich they are assigned, and which are necessary merely in order\r\nthat the community may exist. As soon as any man or woman has passed\r\nthe period of elementary instruction and is assigned to service by\r\nthis Committee, he finds himself in possession of many leisure hours\r\na day--and those hours of leisure constitute the important part of\r\nhis life, and it is on their account that he is to be congratulated\r\non reaching maturity. For now he may have the opportunity both for\r\nself-expression and for the better sort of service to the State; he may\r\ndevote himself to study, research or creation in any field that suits\r\nhis fancy (there is absolutely no restriction in this regard, although\r\nevery one is expected to apply himself to some definite pursuit). One,\r\nfor example, may elect to paint landscapes; a second to conduct some\r\nelaborate philosophic inquiry; a third to write poetry; a fourth to\r\ninvestigate the ways of marine animals; a fifth to be an actor, or a\r\nmusical virtuoso, or the author of historical essays, or a critic of\r\narchitecture, or a designer of fine tapestries.”\r\n\r\n“But what if one finds nothing at all that he can do?” I inquired,\r\nwondering how on earth I could fit myself into this superior scheme of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but one must find something!” declared the Head Member, while his\r\ncolleagues eyed one another with looks implying that I was really too\r\nnaïve for belief. “It would be a disgrace to do nothing at all except\r\none’s practical duties. It would mean that one had been a failure in\r\nlife; that one’s existence had added nothing to the world. Why, there\r\nisn’t more than one such a case a year--and then it’s usually found\r\nthat the poor sufferer has been the victim of some accident, which\r\nblunted his mental faculties.”\r\n\r\nThe Head Member paused; and while I had horrific visions of myself as\r\nthe first failure in a year, one of the members just to the rear of\r\nthe Head Member leaned over and whispered something into his ear. Just\r\nwhat he said I could not catch, but the evident effect was to hasten\r\nproceedings, for the chief official promptly turned to me, and, with\r\nunwonted directness, continued, “Well, now that we have made all the\r\nnecessary explanations, let us get down to the actual assignment. Just\r\nwhat sort of work do you think you would prefer, young man?”\r\n\r\nHaving no reason to believe that I would prefer any work at all, I did\r\nnothing but gape blankly at the speaker.\r\n\r\n“I am surprised at your hesitancy,” that sedate individual at length\r\ncontinued, blandly. “There is so much for you to do that I should think\r\nyou would simply overwhelm us with suggestions.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut I fear that I continued to do nothing but look blank. “You will\r\npardon me,” I pleaded, when the suspense had become embarrassing, “if\r\nI leave the suggestions to you. I really know so little about Atlantis\r\nthat I couldn’t possibly choose wisely.”\r\n\r\n“True, you do know little about Atlantis,” coincided the Head Member,\r\nwith a smile. “But there is something about which you undoubtedly know\r\na great deal, and about which we Atlanteans know nothing at all.”\r\n\r\n“You mean--my own country?” I demanded, while all the members of the\r\nCommittee leaned forward with interested glances.\r\n\r\n“Of course--your own country, and the upper world in general,” the\r\nHead Member nodded, approvingly. “You must remember, our latest news\r\nof your world was received some three thousand years ago. Even for a\r\nleisurely people like us, that is a long while. You cannot imagine how\r\ncurious we are as to all that has happened since.”\r\n\r\n“And that’s what you want me to tell you?”\r\n\r\n“Naturally. We know, to be sure, that no one man could begin to tell\r\nus everything, but at least we’d like to learn the general outline of\r\nevents. And so we are thinking of appointing you Official Historian of\r\nthe Upper World.”\r\n\r\n“Official Historian of the Upper World!” I repeated, like one in a daze.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why not? Judging from the fact that you’ve made quicker progress\r\nin our language than any of your companions, we think you would perhaps\r\nbe better qualified for the office.”\r\n\r\n“But I haven’t specialized in history--” I started to plead.\r\n\r\n“We’re more interested in general movements than in particular\r\nincidents,” explained the Head Member. “The sort of knowledge that any\r\neducated man might give us, is what we want.\r\n\r\n“You certainly are not unacquainted with the present civilization up\r\nabove, are you?”\r\n\r\n“No, not altogether,” I was forced to acknowledge.\r\n\r\n“And you’ve been taught a reasonable amount about the past, have you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve taken a number of history courses at college, if that’s what you\r\nmean.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent! Excellent!” And the Head Member beamed upon me\r\ningratiatingly. “Then the rest should be a mere matter of study and\r\napplication. You don’t object to the appointment, do you?”\r\n\r\nI confessed that I did not object.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, turning to his associates, he inquired, “Do you all approve\r\nof the appointment of Anson Harkness as Official Historian of the Upper\r\nWorld?”\r\n\r\nSince there was no dissent among the Committee members, my life-work\r\nwas apparently settled.\r\n\r\n“But just what do you expect me to do?” I queried, somewhat doubtfully,\r\nafter my appointment had been confirmed.\r\n\r\n“You are to write a history of the upper world, of course,” explained\r\nthe Head Member, surprised that I should ask the obvious. “How you\r\nare to proceed will be for you to decide; but you must remember that\r\nthis will be your assigned work, to which you are expected to devote\r\nnot less than two hours a day. I might point out, moreover, that yours\r\nis one of those rare cases where the assigned work is so important\r\nthat you might do well to combine it with your optional work, and so\r\ndedicate your time exclusively to your duties as historian.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that would be the best way,” I agreed, for it struck me that\r\nthe task before me would require all my energies.\r\n\r\nBut at that juncture an important question occurred to me. I did not\r\nwish to seem too commercial; but it was evident that the examiners had\r\noverlooked something essential. “Now as to the practical returns,” I\r\nventured, mildly. “I know, of course, that I cannot expect to be paid\r\nvery much--”\r\n\r\n“To be paid?” repeated four or five of the Committee members all\r\nat once, with looks of such sheer amazement that I knew that I had\r\nblundered.\r\n\r\n“Oh, then perhaps I must show you some results first?” I suggested,\r\nperceiving no other alternative.\r\n\r\nFor two or three seconds there was silence--an ominous, puzzling\r\nsilence which made me realize that I had given deep offense.\r\n\r\n“Young man,” the Head Member at length broke forth, severely, “I fear\r\nthat you are under a grave misapprehension. But possibly you are not\r\nwholly to blame, for it may be that your own country still labors under\r\nthose primitive social arrangements which we Atlanteans abolished three\r\nthousand years ago. Know, then, that there is no such thing as payment\r\nin our land. There is no money; there is no medium of exchange. You\r\ndo your work, and in return receive all the necessaries of life; your\r\nmeals are brought to you by State employees, just as they have been\r\nbrought to you thus far; you are also lodged by the State, clothed by\r\nthe State, educated by the State; the State works of art are at your\r\ndisposal, you are admitted freely to all State entertainments, and are\r\neven granted periodic vacations to break the monotony of existence.\r\nWhat more could any man desire?”\r\n\r\n“No more, of course,” I conceded, feeling utterly crushed.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then,” said the official, with an indulgent smile that made\r\nme feel ridiculous. “Now there is only one more matter to be decided.\r\nHow would you like to set out on your travels the day after tomorrow?”\r\n\r\n“What travels?” I gasped, wondering what on earth he could mean.\r\n\r\n“Why, evidently you haven’t heard about that, either!” remarked the\r\nHead Member, noting my surprise. “You see, every Atlantean, upon\r\nreceiving his assignment and before taking up his duties, is expected\r\nto make a tour of the country, so as to acquaint himself with it\r\nat first hand. Otherwise, how could he expect to voice himself\r\nintelligently on national affairs?”\r\n\r\nHaving nothing to say in reply, I merely gaped and remained silent.\r\n\r\n“Ordinarily, this journey requires about a month,” my informer\r\nproceeded. “The trip is made entirely on foot, so that one may observe\r\nthe country thoroughly. There is a party leaving in two days--perhaps\r\nyou would like to join them.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I assented. And, after being advised regarding a few\r\ndetails of the trip and then notified of my dismissal, I went away\r\nfeeling more puzzled than ever, for I could not believe that Atlantis\r\ncould show me anything more marvelous than it had already shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                         The Journey Commences\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later I set out on what was to prove the most extraordinary\r\nexcursion of my life. Arriving early in the morning at the appointed\r\nmeeting place--an open, flower-bordered “circle” or park near the\r\nwestern end of the town--I was greeted by a score of eager young men\r\nand women, who introduced themselves as my traveling companions. They\r\nwere all in an excited, highly animated condition, chatting and jesting\r\ncontinually, moving about restlessly, gay with the gaiety of high\r\nexpectations; and they all, without exception, were conspicuously and\r\nvividly youthful, for their ages must have varied between eighteen and\r\ntwenty-one. At the same time, they resembled their fellow Atlanteans\r\nin that they looked utterly wholesome and unworldly, and had the grace\r\nand beauty of persons whose lives have been unstained and whose minds\r\nuntarnished.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering whether these attractive creatures were to\r\nbe my sole companions, when I was surprised by the sight of four\r\nnewcomers--two men and two women of somewhat maturer years than\r\nthe others. At the moment of their arrival they were surrounded so\r\nenthusiastically by the members of the party that I had not a chance\r\nfor a clear glimpse of them; but even a partial glimpse was enough to\r\nmake me stop short with a gasp of delight--among their number I thought\r\nI saw the sparkling blue eyes of Aelios! At first I was not sure; but\r\nwith fast-throbbing heart I pressed forward, and to my inexpressible\r\njoy found that I had not been mistaken.\r\n\r\n“Aelios!” I cried, as soon as I could manage to draw her to one side.\r\n“Aelios--what are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled her bewilderingly sweet smile, but did not choose to answer\r\ndirectly. “What are you doing here?” she countered.\r\n\r\n“Why, you should know without asking,” I reminded her. “Didn’t I show\r\nyou my summons from the Committee on Selective Assignments?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I remember,” she murmured. “Only, I didn’t know you would set\r\nout on your travels so soon. But I’m really very glad. Now you’ll be a\r\nfull-fledged citizen of Atlantis!”\r\n\r\n“But are you going with us, Aelios? Are you going, too?” I asked, still\r\nunable to credit my good fortune.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am going.” And, observing how quizzically I was regarding her,\r\nshe continued, “You see, three or four tutors are assigned to each of\r\nthe traveling parties, for we have made the journey before, and are\r\nable to explain the sights along the way.”\r\n\r\n“But how can you leave so suddenly?” I questioned, remembering\r\nStranahan’s daily lessons. “How about--how about the work you were\r\ndoing here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am excused, of course, until my return. Some other tutor is\r\nsubstituted for me, and everything goes along smoothly enough with my\r\nstudents.”\r\n\r\n“Their loss is our good fortune,” said I, quite truthfully; and Aelios\r\nacknowledged the compliment with a gracious bow, and then smilingly\r\nrejoined the other tutors.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we were under way. We crossed the Salty River\r\non a long bridge overarched with a crystal arcade and lined with\r\nfriezes representing mythological scenes; then on the northern bank,\r\nwe followed a little winding lane westward at the base of the marble\r\npalaces and towers. Before many minutes, we approached the borders\r\nof the city; and when at length we passed into the open country,\r\nmy companions experienced a rare burst of high spirits. Some gave\r\nexpression to their feelings by low, soft cries of joy; some capered,\r\nromped and laughed merrily along the way; some engaged in loud-pitched\r\nand enthusiastic discussions; but all looked carefree and happy indeed;\r\nand I could not help being infected with their gay mood. I experienced\r\nnothing of the constraint that might have been only natural, for\r\nmy companions seemed to accept me frankly as one of them, and in\r\nconsequence I felt hardly out of place. Before long I was chatting with\r\nseveral of the young men as volubly as though I had known them all\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nOf Aelios I caught no more than a glimpse on that first day. She\r\nseemed to be absorbed in her conversations with the other tutors; and\r\nan occasional smiling glance in my direction was all that she would\r\nvouchsafe me. But I was happy merely to know that she was near, and was\r\nconvinced that succeeding days would offer opportunities to strengthen\r\nour friendship. And at the same time I was so well occupied that I had\r\nlittle leisure for thinking of anybody in particular.\r\n\r\nTo one who has never been underseas and gazed at the landscapes of\r\nthat incredible world, it will be impossible to convey any idea of\r\nthe enthusiasm and the wonder I felt. Already I had beheld marvels\r\nin Atlantis, marvels sufficient to bewilder the most audacious\r\nimagination; but that which I now observed was so unique as momentarily\r\nto overshadow even my previous discoveries.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the first hour after leaving the city we pursued a little path\r\nthat ran almost in a straight line along the banks of the Salty River.\r\nOpposite us, across the stream, stretched the long, low contours of the\r\ncolonnades and temples I had inspected soon after arriving in Atlantis;\r\nand at our feet the waters shot swiftly by, with gentle swishing and\r\nmurmuring, a green-gray expanse several hundred yards across, but\r\ndiffering from all other rivers I had ever beheld in that it was of the\r\nsame width at all points and flowed in a straight and orderly manner\r\nwithout any twists, turns or meanderings.\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, I had already observed; and my first surprises\r\nwere not to come until at length the road bent abruptly northward away\r\nfrom the river and we entered what was for me a virgin territory. As we\r\nadvanced, the vegetation became denser and more curious; tall reeds,\r\nbushes and trees began to cluster about us until I had the impression\r\nof being lost in a jungle. But it was a jungle such as no explorer has\r\never viewed in the wilds of Africa, New Guinea, or Brazil, for the\r\nplants were so fantastic that even the strange undersea vegetation I\r\nhad already beheld seemed commonplace by comparison. Here, for the\r\nfirst time, the trees were of a vivid green, and a normal foliage was\r\nabundant; yet there was so much which looked abnormal that I could\r\nonly stare and stare in amazement. Some of the trees had branches\r\nsymmetrically woven into the likenesses of great cobwebs, and from\r\nthose cobwebs at regular intervals dangled dusters of grape-like\r\nfruits; other trees were cactus-like and leafless, with huge round\r\nprotuberances at regular intervals along their spiny boles; still\r\nothers were almost concealed amid thick meshes of vines, or were\r\nadorned with multicolored cup-shaped blossoms larger than a man’s\r\nhead, or dominated by scores of succulent-looking stalks like gigantic\r\nasparagus. Then again some were little more than great rounded and\r\ncompressed masses of leafage, reminding me of ten-foot cabbages; and\r\nsome would have struck me as nothing more than ordinary mushrooms,\r\nhad they not reached as high as my waist; and some of the shrubs and\r\ncreepers bore pods resembling those of beans and peas, except that\r\nthey were over a foot in length. But the most conspicuous fact about\r\nthis strange assemblage of plants was that the vast majority seemed to\r\nbe fruit-bearing; and on all sides one could observe a multitude of\r\ngreen fruits of all sizes and shapes, as well as a profusion of the\r\nripening and ripe product, some of it small as cherries and some large\r\nas watermelons, some pale green and some gaudy red, some lemon-hued and\r\nsome a modest pink and some a deep purple, but all striking one by a\r\ncontrast and a variety as pleasing to the eye as it was extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAs we entered this peculiar jungle-like region, I noted a marked\r\nchange in the atmosphere. For the first time, I became aware that there\r\ncould be such a thing as climate in Atlantis: the air was growing dank\r\nand overheated, and I had the impression of having entered the tropics.\r\nAnd simultaneously I observed an increase of light that for the moment\r\ndazzled me, and I felt as if a torrid sun were burning directly above.\r\nYet the source of the added warmth and illumination was in no way a\r\nmystery: brilliant white lamps had been placed at intervals along the\r\ngreat roof-supporting tinted columns, glaring down upon the foliage\r\nlike miniature suns, and combining with the larger golden orbs to lend\r\nthe scene a dream-like and unearthly beauty.\r\n\r\nBefore long I noted that the vegetation was interrupted every few\r\nhundred yards by a ditch from five to ten feet across and filled to\r\nthe brim with sluggish brown water. Had not these trenches invariably\r\nbeen of even width and geometrical straightness, I might have mistaken\r\nthem for rivulets; but their precise outlines would permit but one\r\ninterpretation, and they brought me remembrances of the irrigation\r\ncanals I had seen on the semi-arid plains of Arizona and California.\r\nIt seemed, however, that they served more than a single purpose; for\r\nas we crossed a little arching bridge over one of the widest of their\r\nwaterways, I saw a long, flat boat anchored just beneath my feet; and\r\nfour or five men, clad in close-fitting gray instead of in the usual\r\nlong-flowing tinted robes, were busy loading this barge with newly\r\nplucked clusters of blue and crimson and orange-colored fruit.\r\n\r\nEven had there been no one to enlighten me concerning these queer\r\njungles, I would now have understood their general nature. Still they\r\nseemed to embody a multitude of mysteries, mysteries to be explained by\r\nno known laws of biology; and, accordingly, I listened eagerly when one\r\nof the tutors, finding himself besieged by an enthusiastic, questioning\r\ncoterie, launched forth upon on explanatory discourse.\r\n\r\n“From the earliest times, as you know,” said he, speaking informally,\r\nand yet with something of the manner of a professor addressing his\r\nclass, “We Atlanteans have been skilled in horticulture. To begin\r\nwith, nature provided the stimulus, for the flora of an island such\r\nas Atlantis is apt to be unique, and that of our own country was\r\nparticularly so. But long before the Submergence, we had outdone nature\r\nby developing a multitude of new plants; and since the Submergence\r\nour botanists have busied themselves incessantly with the study\r\nof artificial stimulation of vegetable life. It is well known how\r\nindustriously they have experimented, trying the effect of new soils\r\nand environments, grafting the limbs of innumerable bushes and trees,\r\ncross-fertilizing and encouraging all favorable chance growths or\r\n‘sports’; and in these pursuits they have been aided by the altered\r\nenvironment of Atlantis, which seems favorable to rapid and sudden\r\nvariation, and has given rise to innumerable varieties of plants\r\nunknown before.\r\n\r\n“I do not need to tell you how essential all this has been for the\r\nmaintenance of Atlantean life, for our land is limited in extent and\r\nmuch of it is unsuited for agriculture; only by the intensive and\r\nforced development of the rest can we hope to support our people. And\r\nso it has been necessary to evolve food-plants that would produce more\r\nprolifically than any known before; and at the same time we have had to\r\ndevelop a light which would be the chemical equivalent of sunlight, and\r\nso would stimulate the chlorophyl of the leaves, the original source\r\nof all organic matter. This, to be sure, was accomplished even before\r\nthe Submergence; but since the Submergence there has been a constant\r\nimprovement in the quality of the artificial sunlight; and in the\r\neleventh century A. S., the great chemist, Sorandos, produced a light\r\nactually superior to sunlight. At least (for some reason that Sorandos\r\nhimself never made sufficiently plain) it stimulates plant life to an\r\nextraordinarily rapid growth, even though it has the compensating fault\r\nof inducing rapid decay. It is this light which you see shining down\r\nupon you now from the great stone columns.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused, and I thought the time opportune to put a question\r\nwhich had been puzzling me. “You tell us that you have need for\r\nintensive crop production,” said I, “and yet have I not heard that you\r\ncan produce food chemically?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” admitted the tutor, with a shrug. “The same light that\r\ndevelops the chlorophyl in plants may be employed for the synthetic\r\nmanufacture of starch and sugar out of charcoal and distilled water.\r\nBut that is an old-fashioned method, and not very successful on the\r\nwhole, for we have found that this artificial food lacks some element\r\nessential for good health.”\r\n\r\n“Even so, why rely wholly upon plant life?” I inquired, curious to know\r\nwhy my diet in Atlantis had been strictly vegetarian. “Do you never--do\r\nyou never eat meat?”\r\n\r\n“Eat meat?” The tutor’s tone was one of astonishment; and I observed\r\nhalf a dozen pairs of eyes staring at me in shocked surprise.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I felt like one who has urged cannibalism or some\r\nother barbarous rite. And my discomfort was scarcely relieved when\r\nmy informant sternly declared, “There has been no meat consumed in\r\nAtlantis since the Submergence; flesh-eating has been discarded along\r\nwith the other uncivilized practices of the ancients. How could we feel\r\nourselves to be superior to the beasts and yet live at the cost of\r\nblood?”\r\n\r\n“But are there no animals at all in Atlantis?” I found the courage to\r\ninquire.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, though naturally we couldn’t take care of many after the\r\nSubmergence.” And my companion paused, and pointed to a little\r\nred-breasted feathered thing perched amid the dense green of the\r\nfoliage. “There are birds of course--we could not dispense with them.\r\nThen there are a few insects, such as the butterflies--and the bees,\r\nwhich give us honey and are necessary for plant pollenization--though\r\nall harmful insects were long ago destroyed. Also, there are squirrels\r\nand chipmunks and other small creatures; and in the Salty River and the\r\ncanals there are numerous fish. And in some places along the banks of\r\nthe Salty River there are hundreds of bullfrogs.”\r\n\r\n“Bullfrogs!” I exclaimed. “Bullfrogs!” And suddenly I understood the\r\nmeaning of those strange noises which had so terrified my shipmates and\r\nmyself during our first night in Atlantis!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: And along each side of the broad passageway, rising\r\nalmost to meet the ceiling, was a series of what I took to be gigantic\r\nboilers. All of these were connected with innumerable wires and\r\nwith pipes thicker than a man’s body, while at the further end of\r\nthe gallery the tubes were interwoven in intricate loops, coils and\r\nconvolutions like the exposed entrails of a Titan.]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                             The Glass City\r\n\r\n\r\nFor five or six hours we proceeded through the fruit-bearing jungles,\r\nwhich seemed limitless in extent and yet constantly displayed new and\r\nunexpected features. But the journey was by no means arduous, for\r\ntwice we paused for rest and refreshments at little open-air inns that\r\nfronted the roads; at all times our pace was unhurried. And most of the\r\nparty seemed still fresh and energetic when, toward the middle of the\r\nafternoon, we emerged suddenly from the thickets and saw a group of\r\nfairy-like towers gleaming straight ahead.\r\n\r\n“That is the city of Thalos,” I heard one of the tutors explaining. “It\r\nis there that we stay for the night.”\r\n\r\nAs we approached, I directed my eyes eagerly upon Thalos, which even\r\nat a distance appeared strikingly different from Archeon. Indeed,\r\nit appeared strikingly different from any city I had ever seen, for\r\nno streets or thoroughfares of any kind were visible, and, as we\r\ndrew near, the various buildings seemed to merge in a long unbroken\r\nline dominated by turrets, domes and spires spaced at geometrical\r\nintervals; and all those domes and spires flashed and sparkled with a\r\nmulti-colored light, which changed in hue and intensity with every step\r\nwe took and was elusive and yet vivid as the glittering of innumerable\r\ngems.\r\n\r\nSo awe-stricken was I that I scarcely thought of questioning my\r\ncompanions, but hastened toward this alluring city. And the nearer I\r\napproached the more dazzled I was. By degrees I came to realize that\r\na high wall surrounded the town; but this wall brought no reminders\r\nof the fortified bulwarks of ancient cities, for its outlines were\r\ngraceful and pleasing, its color an agreeable dark blue, and its\r\nevident purpose ornamental. And when I had come within a few hundred\r\nyards of the city, I observed that its blueness was translucent,\r\nindicating that the building material was glass!--and, judging from the\r\npeculiar glistening and glinting of the towers projecting above the\r\nwall, I wondered whether stained glass were not the substance of the\r\nentire town!\r\n\r\nThis, in fact, I discovered was so. Having passed through the wall\r\nby means of a little arched gateway invisible at a distance, I found\r\nmyself in what might have been a city out of the Arabian Nights. I\r\ncannot say with certainty whether I beheld a single building or a\r\nhundred, or whether I stood in an open court or in a street; for before\r\nme spread a wide expanse of glass masonry, of arches and covered\r\ngalleries, of steeples and cupolas and winding balconies; and all this\r\nmasonry seemed to be joined in a more or less unified whole. There may\r\nhave been individual edifices, but there was no edifice not connected\r\nwith its neighbors by arching walls or overhead passageways; there may\r\nhave been streets winding through this wilderness of glass, but it\r\nstruck me that there were only open spaces alternating with twining\r\nglass-roofed corridors. Yet, however bizarre the total impression (and\r\nbizarre it was beyond all imagining), there was also a certain unity\r\nthat prevented the city from appearing grotesque; and its various\r\nsegments, in their garments of lavender or pale blue or turquoise or\r\nvivid ruby, fitted together as perfectly as the parts of an intricate\r\nand beautiful mosaic.\r\n\r\nWe had barely entered the city when half a dozen natives emerged from\r\nunseen corridors and greeted us. Like the members of our own party,\r\nthey were dressed in exquisite light-tinted gowns; and, like all the\r\nAtlanteans, they were well built, prepossessing of appearance and\r\nhandsome; and there was a perfect natural courtesy in their manner when\r\nthey assured us how welcome we were and bade us accompany them to our\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\nStill speechless with wonder, I followed my companions through long\r\ncrystal galleries, around the base of jewel-like glimmering towers, and\r\nacross flowered parks where iridescent fountains splashed and bubbled.\r\n“This is typical of the latest in architecture,” I heard one of the men\r\nsaying, as he pointed up at the curving, interlinking stained glass\r\nporticoes and domes. “Thalos in its present form is not more than five\r\ncenturies old, and is exclusively a development of Post-Submergence\r\nart.”\r\n\r\nAlmost before these words were out of the speaker’s mouth, we were\r\nled up a long flight of stairs and through an elliptical doorway into\r\na chamber which, to my surprise, was walled and roofed not with glass,\r\nbut with marble. Here we were treated to a sumptuous repast, consisting\r\nof a sort of vegetable steak, native cakes and bread, honey and fruit,\r\nwhich already lay spread for us on half a dozen little tables. And,\r\nafter we had dined, we were each shown to a room on the roof, which was\r\nequipped with all articles that necessity or convenience could demand,\r\nand where, if we wished, we might well rest from the day’s exertions.\r\n\r\nSome of our party may possibly have availed themselves of this\r\nopportunity; but, for my own part, I was so excited merely at being in\r\nThales, that a rest was out of the question.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had washed myself clean of the dust of the journey, I\r\nmade my way down from my roof-apartment and out of the building. As\r\nI stepped toward the outer door, I was rejoiced to see a familiar\r\nblue-clad figure preceding me down the stairs. “Aelios!” I cried; and\r\nwhen she turned to see what was the matter, I joined her with the\r\nbreathless suggestion that we take a little stroll together. And--quite\r\nunexpectedly--she obliged me by agreeing.\r\n\r\n“Luckily, I’ve been here before, and so know my way about,” she said,\r\nas we started. “If you went alone, you might get lost.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t mind--in such a charming place,” I declared, with a smile.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as a means of making conversation, I remarked, “The people\r\nhere are exceedingly hospitable, aren’t they?”\r\n\r\n“Hospitable?” she echoed, as if not understanding. “What makes you\r\nthink that?”\r\n\r\nSurprised, I pointed out the self-evident fact that they had lodged and\r\nfeasted us so splendidly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is not they that have lodged and feasted us!” she corrected.\r\n“It is the State!”\r\n\r\nIt was now my turn to look blank, and hers to explain.\r\n\r\n“Our complete itinerary has been arranged in advance,” she continued,\r\n“and all our needs will be provided for by the State, just as the State\r\nprovides for us when we’re at home. Obviously, that’s the only possible\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“Then is there no such thing as private property in Atlantis?” I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“Private property?” She looked puzzled, as though trying to assimilate\r\nan alien point of view. “What would be the use of private property?”\r\n\r\nThen, seeing the dull stare with which I replied, she proceeded, “Of\r\ncourse, I remember that there used to be private property in the old\r\ndays, before the Submergence. But that has all been abolished long ago.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” I exclaimed, thinking this the most incredible\r\nstatement I had yet heard.\r\n\r\n“Well, not quite all abolished,” she amended, thoughtfully. “Our\r\nclothes and books and personal ornaments are still private property, of\r\ncourse.”\r\n\r\n“But does the State supply one with everything else?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, with everything, including one’s clothes. You’ll see for yourself\r\nwhen you return from this trip and set out as a citizen.”\r\n\r\nThereupon she told me a few more facts about the State control of\r\nproperty, and how things such as inheritance and taxation were unknown.\r\nThen gradually the conversation shifted to less impersonal and more\r\nalluring subjects. She asked me about the world I had come from, and\r\nwhether it had any architectural marvels rivalling those of Thalos;\r\nand I replied that it had not, though the skyscrapers of New York were\r\nconsidered wondrous enough. I was reluctant to talk about my own world,\r\nhowever; I did not wish to be disturbed by remembrances; I desired\r\nonly to be walking with Aelios as I was walking now, and to hear her\r\nspeak, and to be permitted to look into those bright and glamorous blue\r\neyes of hers. And so I listened like one in a trance as she told me\r\nof her life, and how she had been the eldest child of two celebrated\r\nartists and had never lacked anything she really wanted, and how from\r\nher earliest years she had loved music and the dance, but particularly\r\nthe dance, and had followed her childhood inclinations in her chosen\r\nwork for the State, though in her prescribed work she was a tutor. All\r\nthis and much more Aelios told me about herself, while I heard her with\r\nadoration that must have been all too apparent in my fascinated gaze.\r\nBut she seemed without self-consciousness and without realization of\r\nthe tender sentiments welling up within me; and she rambled eagerly on\r\nand on, speaking with animation and vivacity, as one speaks to an old\r\nand amiable companion.\r\n\r\nWe must have strolled through the rambling thoroughfares for an hour,\r\nwhen we seated ourselves on a cushioned marble bench at one corner of a\r\nwide court. “If we stay here until dark,” suggested Aelios, “you will\r\nsee one of the most curious exhibitions that you have ever seen.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed only a few minutes later when, without warning, the golden\r\norbs above us flickered, grew dim, and flashed into blackness. Then,\r\nwhile I was wondering whether we were to be left in total gloom,\r\nother lights gleamed from the city’s unseen pinnacles; and their rays\r\ndarted in long streamers against a blank glass wall directly across\r\nfrom us, illuminating it with fantastic and unbelievable designs.\r\nUnlike the searchlights that had amazed me at the Pageant of the Good\r\nDestruction, these lights were not without apparent purpose; they shed\r\ndefinite patterns, I might almost say pictures, upon the broad glass\r\nscreen. First one could make out the form of a man, life-sized and\r\nwith pale-colored robes, moving in agile cinematograph fashion; then\r\na woman or a child would advance across the screen to meet him; then\r\nthe two would engage in various significant motions or gesticulations,\r\nto be joined perhaps by others; and in the swaying and blending of\r\nthe lights, the weird mingling and intermingling of a myriad shades\r\nand colors, the background of shadows and the foreground of lithe and\r\nactive figures, I realized that I was witnessing the representation of\r\nscenes from Atlantean life!\r\n\r\nWhat those scenes were I cannot recall. But I have the impression that\r\nthey aimed to present life symbolically rather than literally; that\r\nbeauty was their purpose rather than accuracy, and that a pleasing\r\nharmony of color, tone and proportion was deemed more important than a\r\nstringent realism. I fear that I was not sufficiently advanced in the\r\nnative art to appreciate them, for they left little more effect upon\r\nmy mind than an exhibition of mere technique with the violin or piano\r\nwould leave upon one untrained in music.\r\n\r\nBut, at the time, the spectacle certainly did have its influence.\r\nAlthough vaguely aware that the seats about me were being silently\r\noccupied, I could scarcely give a thought to my surroundings; and under\r\nthe enchantment of the shifting and pictorial lights, I felt as if\r\nAelios and I were alone together; and I pressed close to her, until\r\nnot a fraction of an inch divided us and it seemed that we breathed\r\nnot as two persons but as one. Very cautiously, as though it were a\r\nclandestine and forbidden act, I reached out my hand till it touched\r\nhers and the palm closed softly over her fingers. She did not return\r\nthe pressure and yet did not withdraw her hand, nor even seem to notice\r\nwhat I was doing; and, in my confusion, I scarcely knew whether to feel\r\nencouraged or repulsed.\r\n\r\nThen, by that wavering and uncertain light, I caught a glimpse of her\r\neyes. They were bright and shining--and did they merely reflect her\r\njoy at the colored display? Not a word was spoken between us, nor was\r\nI anxious that a word be spoken; I had sudden visions of a tomorrow\r\nfairer than I would once have dared to hope for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                            Farm and Factory\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning we were again under way. Leaving Thalos\r\nthrough a little arched gateway under the western wall, we trudged for\r\nseveral hours through flat green countryside. Here and there, amid\r\nbreaks in the vegetation, we observed edifices which my companions\r\ndescribed as “farmhouses,” but which, with their statue-lined walls\r\nand marble columns, seemed to me to be little less than palaces. These\r\nremarkable dwellings, of which there must have been four or five to\r\nevery square mile, were conspicuous from a distance, for there were no\r\nobscuring trees, and the landscape was dominated by a hardy reed that\r\ngrew shoulder-high in impenetrable clusters.\r\n\r\nExcept for the size of this plant, I might have fancied it to be a\r\nvariety of wheat. Not only were its leaves long and grass-like, but it\r\nbore a rich crop of some grain that closely resembled wheat, although\r\neach of the seed-clusters were large as ears of Indian corn. That it\r\nwas cultivated for food purposes was obvious, for brilliant white lamps\r\nwere beaming from the tinted columns as in the fruit-jungles, and at\r\nregular intervals we passed irrigation ditches, and now and then caught\r\nglimpses of gray-clad men at work amid the green thickets.\r\n\r\nBut while this scenery was fairly interesting, it was on the whole the\r\nmost monotonous I had yet viewed in Atlantis. Hence I was relieved when\r\nthe landscape showed a sudden change, and the cultivated plains gave\r\nway to a series of long, low, grass-covered hills. From the beginning,\r\nI noticed something peculiar about these eminences, for their contours\r\nwere rounded with almost geometrical evenness; while beyond the\r\nfurthest heights, a clear, rapid stream flowed out of the ground as\r\nif forced up from nowhere, and, after meandering to the edge of the\r\nreed-covered plain, divided into half a dozen diverging irrigation\r\ncanals. But all this was less surprising than what I next observed; for\r\nas I stood staring at the stream in wonder, a huge rock at the base of\r\nthe nearest hill thrust itself outward, and a man emerged as if from\r\nthe center of the earth!\r\n\r\nStartled, I turned to my companions for an explanation--but not a\r\nmurmur issued from them, and their faces showed none of that amazement\r\nI might have expected. “Here is where we enter,” declared one of the\r\ntutors, in matter-of-fact tones; and followed by the rest of the party,\r\nhe plunged through the aperture made by the dislodged boulder.\r\n\r\nLike one in a dream--or rather like one in a nightmare--I trailed\r\nwith the others into that hole on the hillside. As I approached the\r\nentrance, I found that what I had taken to be a rock was not a rock at\r\nall, but merely a cleverly disguised bit of metal; upon reaching the\r\ndoorway, I was amazed to find, instead of the tunnel-like corridor I\r\nhad expected, a spacious and wide-vaulting hall.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Sunken World itself it was the largest\r\nenclosure I had ever entered; indeed, it occupied the entire interior\r\nof the hill. Along the full length of a half-mile gallery the\r\nwhite-lanterned ceiling arched to a height of two hundred feet; and on\r\neach side of a broad passageway, rising almost to meet the ceiling,\r\nwas a series of what I took to be gigantic boilers. All of these were\r\nconnected with innumerable wires and with pipes thicker than a man’s\r\nbody, while at the further end of the gallery the tubes were interwoven\r\nin intricate loops, coils and convolutions like the exposed entrails of\r\na Titan.\r\n\r\nAs I stepped through the doorway, a warm breeze swept my face, bearing\r\nto my nostrils the odor of oil, and at the same time bringing me\r\nreminders of the furnace-dry air of steam-heated apartments. “What\r\nplace is this?” I could not forebear to ask; but almost instantly I was\r\nsorry that I had spoken, for four or five pairs of eyes were turned\r\nupon me in surprise at so obvious a question.\r\n\r\n“This is a distillery, of course,” answered one of my young companions.\r\n\r\n“A distillery?” I echoed, scarcely less astonished at his words than at\r\nthe extraordinary appearance of the place. And although the Atlanteans\r\nhad seemed to me to be a sober people, I had visions of the manufacture\r\nof intoxicants on a scale inconceivable to the most bibulous of my own\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n“Yes, this is where we prepare our distilled water,” continued my\r\nfriend, surprised at my surprise.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment I merely stared at him without comprehension. “But why so\r\nmuch distilled water?” was all that I could gasp.\r\n\r\n“That’s easily explained,” said the young man, with a smile. “The water\r\npiped from our deep wells, which serves us for drinking purposes,\r\ncouldn’t begin to take care of our irrigation problems--and without\r\nirrigation Atlantis would be a desert. The Salty River, of course,\r\ncontains enough for all our needs; but it is ocean water, and the brine\r\nwould kill all land vegetation. And so the only possibility was to\r\ndistill the water. This was arranged for long ago by Agripides, when\r\nhe built this distillery and eleven others, which together keep the\r\nirrigation system of Atlantis supplied, and incidentally provide us\r\nwith all the salt required for domestic and chemical purposes.”\r\n\r\n“That may be all very well,” I remarked, “but the amount of heat\r\nnecessary to evaporate so much water must be tremendous ...”\r\n\r\n“That is no problem at all,” my companion assured me. “By means of\r\nintra-atomic energy, we could generate power enough to distill the\r\nentire ocean.”\r\n\r\nI felt certain that this statement was an exaggeration, but before\r\nI had had time for comment, my attention was suddenly diverted. All\r\nof our party had paused before a circular slit in the floor; and a\r\nbrown-clad workman, stepping forth from amid the boilers, applied a key\r\nto a little hole near the edge of the slit, and removed a steel disk\r\nperhaps five feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nInstantly we were bathed in a brilliant copper light, so dazzling\r\nthat at first I had to turn abruptly away. Then as my startled eyes\r\ngradually accustomed themselves to the vivid illumination, I peered\r\nthrough a glass partition far down into what remotely reminded me\r\nof a furnace, except that no flames were visible, but from the\r\nvague fire-bright background great sheets and rods of a shining red\r\nor a blinding brassy yellow stared at me steadily with unbearable\r\nincandescence.\r\n\r\n“Those are the intra-atomic generators,” explained the workmen. “They\r\nare constantly liberating energy, which is transformed into electrical\r\npower by means of giant induction coils; and it is this electricity\r\nwhich is wired to the boiler-room below and heats the water from the\r\nSalty River.”\r\n\r\n“But how terrible to work down there!” it occurred to me to comment.\r\n“How can any man--”\r\n\r\n“It is not necessary to work down there,” I was promptly informed.\r\n“The generators continue operating automatically so long as they are\r\nsupplied with fuel.”\r\n\r\n“What fuel do you use?” I inquired.\r\n\r\nThe reply was not at all what I had expected. “Any of the heavier\r\nmetals will do,” stated the workman. “One of the best of the cheaper\r\nfuels is gold, for its high atomic weight makes possible extensive\r\ndissociation. Sometimes, however, we use silver, platinum, or\r\nlead--although the latter is ordinarily regarded as too valuable for\r\nsuch purposes. A supply of lead will run the generator for twenty-seven\r\nyears, one of silver for thirty-three, and one of gold for forty-five.\r\nWhen new fuel is required, we simply shoot it in through the tube over\r\nthere.” And the speaker pointed to a tube of about the thickness of a\r\nman’s wrist, which projected several feet above the floor between two\r\nof the boilers.\r\n\r\nI thought that I had now seen enough of the distillery, and was not\r\ndisappointed when my companions made ready to leave. But there was one\r\nproblem which still troubled me: why did the building look so much\r\nlike a hill from without, and why had such evident pains been taken to\r\nconceal its existence?\r\n\r\nTo these questions I found a speedy answer. “If this edifice had\r\nbeen erected in the days before Agripides,” declared one of my young\r\nfriends, “it would have been nothing more than an ugly mass of steel\r\nand stone. But Agripides, seeking a way to beautify the structure and\r\nhide its unavoidable defects, hit upon the plan of covering it with a\r\ncoating of earth and sowing the earth with grass, so as to give the\r\nappearance of a green hill. All our factories, you will find, have in\r\nsome such way been concealed or made beautiful.”\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, I discovered to be the case. We had now reached the\r\nindustrial center of Atlantis; and all the rest of that day we were\r\nbusy inspecting manufacturing plants of sundry kinds and sizes. But\r\nnowhere was the air clouded with that smoke and dust which I had\r\ncome to associate with industrial districts in my own land; nowhere\r\nwas there a dingy or soot-blackened building, nowhere were my ears\r\nassaulted by the shrieking or droning of whistles, or by the hammering,\r\npounding, screeching, whirring or grating of machines. Instead, we\r\npassed through a region that might have been recommended to sufferers\r\nfrom nervous ailments. In the midst of pleasant, grassy lands an\r\noccasional tree-bordered building arose with glittering steeples or\r\nstainless marble facade or august columns of granite; and within each\r\nbuilding, which one might have mistaken for a mansion or a temple,\r\nelectrically driven wheels and levers would be operating noiselessly,\r\npreparing the food of the Atlanteans or weaving their clothes from\r\nthe fibre of a flax-like plant, manufacturing farm implements or\r\nfertilizers or scientific articles or household wares; and in each of\r\nthese factories a few workers (never more than a score) would be calmly\r\nand often smilingly tending the machines, occupying thus their two or\r\nthree hours of assigned daily service for the State.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe institution that interested me most was the building where\r\nchemists were at work renewing the air supply of Atlantis--or, rather,\r\nthe oxygen supply. Here, in a long hall dominated by great vats\r\nconnected by pipes and wires reminding me vaguely of the distillery,\r\na continual stream of water was being disintegrated by a process\r\nof electrolysis, the hydrogen being diverted to enter into various\r\nchemical compounds, with carbon nitrogen and other elements, the\r\noxygen being released into the atmosphere to replace that consumed\r\nby respiration and combustion. By means of the air-gauge, a finely\r\nadjusted apparatus whose index was a flame that varied in intensity\r\nwith the amount of oxygen, chemists were able to determine how much of\r\nthis vital gas was required at any specific time; but some oxygen had\r\nto be provided continually, for, large as Atlantis was, it was not so\r\ngreat that nature would preserve a balance and replace the oxygen that\r\nwas consumed by that freed in the course of organic processes of plant\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut if the Atlantean industries were arranged with a regard for the\r\nwelfare and esthetic sensibilities of the people as a whole, scarcely\r\nless pains had been taken to insure the health and convenience of the\r\nworkers. I will not speak of the safety devices, which had been so\r\nperfected that accidents were virtually unknown; I will not dwell upon\r\nthe precautions to vary the monotony even of the two-or three-hour\r\nworking day, to make possible individual initiative, to guard against\r\nfatigue and excessive strain, or to render the surroundings pleasant\r\nto the eye and mind. But what I must mention, because it impressed\r\nme as unique, is the fact that the workers were housed in dwellings\r\nnot less imposing than the most stately city homes. The road took us\r\nthrough half a dozen villages reserved for the factory workers; and\r\neach of these seemed to be in itself a work of art, with many-columned\r\nresidences, arches and marble portals and connecting colonnades,\r\nflowered parks and statuary and fountains, all co-ordinated in a\r\ntasteful and elegant design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                      The Wall and the Wind-makers\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening we were lodged in the city of Arvon, a moderately large\r\ntown which differed strikingly from anything we had yet seen. Its\r\nscattered houses were huddled amid vegetation so thick that from a\r\ndistance it resembled a forest; and even at close range one could\r\nnot lose sight of its sylvan aspect, since all the buildings were\r\nvine-covered and painted a green and brown that harmonized ideally with\r\nthe woodland colors.\r\n\r\nBut I must not devote too much space to the strange appearance of this\r\ntown--still stranger sights were to greet me on the following day. For\r\nthen I was to reach a turning-point in my journey, and to penetrate\r\nsome of the salient mysteries of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nEven though I did not know what interesting discoveries were before me,\r\nI had a hint of something unusual very early in the morning. We had\r\nhardly left Arvon when I observed that the golden-lighted dome seemed\r\nlower and nearer than usual, and curved gradually down to westward\r\nuntil it appeared to merge with the ground.\r\n\r\n“There’s where the glass wall begins,” said one of the tutors,\r\npointing; and I looked eagerly, hopeful that we would soon reach the\r\nwall itself.\r\n\r\nA little further on, the road curved abruptly southward, and for\r\nseveral miles we merely paralleled the wall. Then, to my joy, a\r\nfamiliar gurgling met my ears--we were back again near the Salty River.\r\nStraight across the stream we passed on an arching bridge dominated by\r\na crystalline pale-blue colonnade; and, on the further side, we again\r\nturned westward, and followed the river directly toward the green glass\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced, I noticed that the waters were becoming white and\r\nfoamy, with great briny patches as if a passing steamer had churned\r\nup the waves. Gradually these frothy expanses grew wilder and more\r\nconspicuous, until the entire river was a seething, effervescent mass;\r\nand troubled waves sprang to life, with turbulence that increased as\r\nwe moved upstream, until the bubbling white was mingled with the green\r\nand gray of leaping surges, and the waters were agitated as if by a\r\nstorm-wind. Yet only the faintest breeze was blowing, and I could not\r\nunderstand the source of the strange commotion.\r\n\r\nAt the some time, a disquieting sound came to my ears--the continuous\r\nand droning sound of thunder, dull and muffled but gradually growing\r\nlouder in spite of the clamoring and roaring of the waves. So\r\ndeep-toned and voluminous was it that it reminded me of a din I never\r\nexpected to hear again--the booming of the ocean along resisting shores.\r\n\r\nAll of our party moved without a word now, moved rapidly and with\r\nfaces straining westward, as if eager for some rare and long-awaited\r\nevent. In their very speechlessness there was a contagious tension;\r\nand, responsive to their mood, I too was expectant, though I could not\r\nimagine what there was to be anticipated.\r\n\r\nBut I did not have long to wait. “Look! There it is!” exclaimed one of\r\nthe party, suddenly. And he paused, and pointed straight ahead; and all\r\nhis companions paused and pointed straight ahead, joining in his awed\r\ncries of “Look! There it is!”\r\n\r\nOf course, I strained my eyes quite as earnestly as any of them. But\r\nat first I saw nothing to impress me. All that was visible was a\r\nbroad sheet of white looming just above the river for almost its full\r\nwidth, as though there were a falls a mile or two upstream. And, in my\r\nignorance, I accepted this as the explanation.\r\n\r\nBut I was speedily to discover my error. Suddenly the path bent away\r\nfrom the river at an acute angle; and as we followed our new course the\r\ndistant thundering grew louder--while a cold wind began to sweep over\r\nus and the supposed waterfall took on unexpected dimensions. By degrees\r\nit lengthened until it seemed a long jet of water shot horizontally\r\nout of some colossal hose. Intensely white, with the whiteness of foam\r\nand edges blurred with spray, it went hurtling with the impetuosity\r\nand swiftness of an arrow from the nozzle of a gigantic pipe, plunging\r\noutward hundreds of yards in a graceful parabola and giving rise to the\r\nSalty River.\r\n\r\nAlmost as remarkable as this torrent of water was the tube from which\r\nit was discharged. This great pipe, which may have been of a steel\r\nalloy, was well over a mile long, and was a hundred yards across at\r\nthe opening; but it narrowed gradually as it crept westward along the\r\nground and disappeared where the green horizon met the earth.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I did not have to inquire as to the meaning. Only one\r\nexplanation was conceivable: the metallic tube was the valve through\r\nwhich the X-111 had found entrance to Atlantis, the valve that admitted\r\nthe ocean water and kept the Salty River supplied. The aperture at\r\nthe ocean end was doubtless not very wide (I was later told that it\r\nwas but twenty-five feet across); but such was the pressure at these\r\ndepths that the waters burst through with the force and swiftness and\r\ntremendous volume I had observed, and had to be diverted through a long\r\nand gradually widening tube before their torrents could be controlled\r\nand safely emptied into the river channel.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs we approached the glass wall, the hoarse and resonant roaring\r\nwas continuously in our ears, thudding and crashing with echoes that\r\nreverberated like the combined monody of a hundred Niagaras. But,\r\nforgetful of the tumult, I kept my eyes fastened straight ahead, where\r\nthe great green dome sloped down to meet the ground in a curve modelled\r\non that of the actual heavens. Except for the dark weird coloration,\r\nI might have fancied that I was staring toward an actual horizon on\r\nearth; and so close was the resemblance that the illusion persisted\r\nuntil I was almost within a stone’s throw of the barrier. Only then\r\ncould I persuade myself that I actually beheld a solid mass; and, even\r\nso, the curvature was so graceful and so elusive that I could not feel\r\nthat a mere wall stretched before me; but, rather, I had the sense that\r\nit was some ultimate boundary, the dividing line between reality and\r\ninfinite nothingness.\r\n\r\nThis impression was confirmed by the fact that the wall at close range\r\nlooked opaque. Olive-green and of impenetrable thickness, it seemed\r\nimpervious to the rays of light; though, remembering my experiences on\r\nthe X-111, I knew that it was really transparent.\r\n\r\nAll the members of our party approached the wall almost breathlessly,\r\nthen held out their hands and touched it in silence--a procedure which\r\nmay have had some ceremonial importance, or may have been akin to the\r\nactions of persons who, seeing the ocean for the first time, gravely\r\ndip their hands in the salt water. At any rate, I lost no time in\r\nfollowing their example, and found that the surface of the wall was\r\njust as I had expected--smooth and polished, and of a substance that\r\nwould have been apparent to a blind man.\r\n\r\nAfter the twenty students had duly inspected the wall, one of the\r\ntutors lifted his voice so as to be heard by the entire party.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said he, “we have now reached the border-land between\r\nAtlantis and the outside world. A rim of glass fifty feet thick\r\ndivides us from the ocean; and that glass, as you know, is composed of\r\ndozens of layers, one above the other, several of them strengthened\r\nwith interwoven strands of fine wire, and all composed of a special\r\npressure-resisting glass devised at the orders of Agripides. You\r\nunderstand, of course, that the wall does not end where you see it, but\r\npenetrates five hundred feet underground, lest the ocean overwhelm us\r\nfrom beneath; you also understand that the glass is ribbed with steel,\r\nwhich holds it together in a sort of latticed framework, with girders,\r\nbeams and stanchions at measured intervals like the metallic skeleton\r\nof a great building.\r\n\r\n“The erection of the wall represents the supreme accomplishment of\r\nAtlantean engineering, and required the labor of thirty thousand men\r\nfor thirty-four years. But Agripides, with his usual foresight, planned\r\nit so, that the work, once done, would never require renewal, for glass\r\nis one of the most durable of substances, and is virtually immune to\r\ndissolution by the ocean waters. We have our immersible vessels, of\r\ncourse, which regularly range the seas around the glass dome in search\r\nof any possible fault or fissure; but no serious damage has ever yet\r\nbeen discovered, and it is safe to say that the present edifice will\r\nserve us and our descendants for a hundred thousand generations.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused, as if for effect; then, noting that his audience\r\nremained silent, he concluded, “Is there anyone that would like to ask\r\na question?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I would,” I surprised myself by saying.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were bent curiously upon me, and I was forced to continue,\r\n“Glass is, as you say, an exceedingly durable substance, but it is also\r\nextremely fragile. Is there no possibility that the wall will ever be\r\ncracked?”\r\n\r\n“Cracked?” echoed the tutor, with a surprised smile. “Do you think\r\nthat, if there had been such a possibility, Atlantis would not have\r\nbeen inundated long ago? Granted, if any very heavy object were to\r\ncollide with the wall, it might be broken and we would be flooded out\r\nlike ants. But how could there be any such heavy object here in the\r\ndeep sea? Certainly, the fishes couldn’t break through.”\r\n\r\n“No, of course not,” I conceded, feeling that I had made myself\r\nridiculous--and with that the discussion ended. But my words were often\r\nto be recalled to me in the tempestuous days that followed; and more\r\nthan one of my hearers was to speak of them as strangely prophetic.\r\n\r\nFor the next hour we followed a little path that clung close to the\r\nglass wall. And, as we proceeded, my impression of its opaqueness\r\nwas dissipated, for from time to time a little flickering light was\r\nmomentarily visible beyond the green thicknesses; and I had disturbing\r\nremembrances of the lantern-bearing fishes that had haunted us on our\r\nway to Atlantis.\r\n\r\nWe had covered not more than a mile or two when we met with a new\r\nsurprise. A brisk breeze began to blow over us; and the farther we\r\nwalked the sharper the breeze grew, until it assumed the fury of a\r\ngale, and for the first time since reaching Atlantis I felt cold,\r\nalmost as if I were back on earth. Why we continued in the face of this\r\nstrange blast I could not understand, nor whence it proceeded nor how\r\nit had been produced. But while I was wondering and fighting my way\r\nthrough the wind, a singular whirring sound came to my ears, a buzzing\r\nas of gigantic flies; and gradually that sound grew louder, until\r\nfrom resembling the murmuring of insects it came to remind me of the\r\nflapping of colossal wings. That this noise was somehow connected with\r\nthe quickening wind was apparent from the first; and the relationship\r\nbecame evident when the path swerved abruptly away from the wall and I\r\nglanced back, to behold a series of queer-looking machines supported\r\non stone pedestals high up against the glass. It would be impossible\r\nto say just what the machines were like, for they were in such rapid\r\nmotion that the parts were not visible; but there were six or eight of\r\nthem, and they were round, and probably each a hundred yards across;\r\nand so swiftly were they rotating that they formed each a gray blur\r\nthrough which the green of the wall was vaguely discernible.\r\n\r\n“Those are the electro-intra-atomic wind generators,” explained\r\none of the tutors. “By means of these great fans and others like\r\nthem stationed at various points around the wall, the atmosphere of\r\nAtlantis is kept in constant circulation. Without them the air would\r\nbe stagnant and the climate sultry and unhealthy. These generators are\r\nin action at all times, with great air-wheels that make from ten to\r\nfifteen revolutions a second; and it is estimated that the daily energy\r\nconsumed by each of them would be sufficient to boil a thousand tons of\r\nice water.”\r\n\r\nWe did not linger long in the vicinity of the great fans, for the\r\nstrong wind was most annoying and the temperature too low for comfort.\r\nBut we set out at a brisk pace across a moss-covered plain away from\r\nthe wall; and we did not pause again until we had reached the city of\r\nLerenon, which was our destination for the day.\r\n\r\nThis town, which was located some miles from the wall and yet was\r\nconstantly fanned by cool breezes from the wind generators, had one\r\nstriking feature all its own: it was dominated by two colossal bronze\r\nfigures, one of a man, the other of a woman, which reached far above\r\nthe city domes and towers halfway to the green-glass sky. Both these\r\nstatues were carved with an irresistible majesty, the man’s face that\r\nof an Apollo, the woman’s that of a Diana; and their right hands were\r\nextended high over the city roofs and joined in a firm clasp, so\r\nlifelike that I might almost have expected them to move and speak. At\r\nfirst I thought that they represented mythological characters, but an\r\ninscription at their base informed me of my error, for the man was\r\nmeant to typify Wisdom, and the woman Beauty; and in their union above\r\nthe spires and columns of Atlantis I thought I could read the meaning\r\nand purpose of the entire land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                            The Journey Ends\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty days of our journey, I was the witness of marvels so\r\nnumerous that, if I were to dwell upon them all, I might fill hundreds\r\nof pages. Yet while there is much that cannot be recorded and much\r\nthat I have forgotten, there are some observations which have stamped\r\nthemselves indelibly upon my memory, and which are so essential for an\r\nunderstanding of Atlantis that I could not well overlook them.\r\n\r\nThus, I found that the wall enclosing the country formed a vast circle,\r\nof a diameter impossible to determine precisely but probably in the\r\nneighborhood of two hundred miles. Thus, also, I learned that the glass\r\nroof was at an average height of five hundred feet above the ground,\r\nalthough the distance varied greatly according to the level of the\r\nland; and I discovered that it was everywhere supported by myriads\r\nof the huge tinted columns--columns with steel interiors and surface\r\nof concrete or stone. I ascertained, likewise, that the Salty River\r\nfollowed an absolutely unbending course, flowing in a straight-line\r\nand on an even, gradual grade from the western wall of Atlantis to\r\nthe eastern (since it was really a canal rather than a river); and I\r\nwas amazed and dazzled at sight of the great intra-atomic pumps which\r\nforced the torrents back into the sea.\r\n\r\nSince they were expected to overcome a pressure of many tons to the\r\nsquare foot, these pumps had to be very powerful; and powerful they\r\nwere, with their labyrinths of levers and revolving chains, and\r\nthree-hundred-foot pistons and rods that pounded against the waters\r\nlike gigantic pile-drivers, pressing them slowly back into the sea to\r\nthe accompaniment of a roaring and thundering that could be heard for\r\nmiles and that proved deafening upon close approach.\r\n\r\nThe cities of Atlantis, according to the count I made, were eighteen\r\nin number (exclusive of the smaller towns and villages). But an\r\nAtlantean city, although always occupying considerable space, was\r\nwhat we in America should scarcely regard as a city at all, since it\r\nnever had more than twenty or twenty-five thousand inhabitants. This\r\ninsignificant population, when considered along with the liberal amount\r\nof territory allotted each town, accounted for the fact that no great\r\ncrowds were ever to be seen on the streets; and it also explained how\r\nit was possible for efficient popular assemblages to debate and decide\r\npublic questions.\r\n\r\nBut the surprising fact about the Atlantean cities was not so much\r\ntheir small population as their almost unbelievable variety. No town\r\nin Atlantis was like any other town; the only characteristic possessed\r\nby them all in common was their unfailing beauty. To give some idea of\r\ntheir amazing diversity, I might mention the city of Atolis, which,\r\nwhen seen from the hill that surmounted it, formed a definite pattern,\r\nresembling some colossal Grecian temple of which the streets and\r\navenues were the columns. Or I might picture Aedla, which was built\r\nalong a series of canals connecting with the Salty River, with a lake\r\nin the center, giving a Venetian effect, except that the palaces were\r\nmore exquisitely designed than any in the upper world. Then, again, I\r\nmight depict the small town of Acropolon, in which all the houses were\r\nconnected in an enormous colonnaded quadrangle surrounding a vividly\r\nflowering park, reminding me of some university I had seen long before;\r\nor I might launch into a lengthy description of Mangona, another\r\nsmall town, whose houses were all roofless and collapsible, and were\r\ngenerally taken down during the day and put into place only at night or\r\nwhen the inhabitants desired seclusion.\r\n\r\nBut more interesting to me than any of these was Sardolos, one of\r\nthe few present-day Atlantean cities that had existed before the\r\nSubmergence. Although of course the town was not the same as in ancient\r\ntimes, and although its gracefully winding thoroughfares and marble\r\nfriezes and frescoed domes represented the work of modern artists, yet\r\nsome relics of the old days had been carefully preserved.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the city, concealed from the general gaze in a\r\nstatue-lined bronze enclosure, were the remains of buildings said to\r\ndate from the second century B. S. Yet, ancient as these ruins were, my\r\nfirst impression was that there was something familiar about them. The\r\nmost conspicuous exhibit was a stone wall, five stories high and with\r\ngaping rectangular holes where the windows had been; and to the rear\r\nwas a mass of rusted and distorted steel, reaching the full height of\r\nthe wall with twisted, spidery arms that had once lent it support.\r\n\r\n“A splendid specimen of pre-Submergence architecture,” stated a\r\nplacard placed prominently before the exhibit. “This was the seat of\r\nthe Stock Market of old Sardolos--a wholesale gambling house abolished\r\nby the Anti-Corruption Act of the first century A. S. The mass of\r\nshapeless and desiccated stone opposite is all that remains of the\r\nInter-Atlantean Bank, which owned a controlling share in this gambling\r\nresort; while just to the right were the ruins of the shrine in which\r\nthe owners of the bank worshipped, and of the clubhouse in which, late\r\nin the second century B. S., they convened in the interest of their\r\nlotteries, and decided to declare the fifth Atlanto-Bengenese war.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut when I looked to see the ruins, all that I beheld was a series\r\nof irregular stone walls, not over two or three feet high and brown\r\nwith the lifeless parchment hue of extreme age. Somehow, it made me\r\nuncomfortable to look upon these vestiges of the past; nor was I\r\nrelieved when I gazed at a picture of Sardolos as it had been, and saw\r\ntwo long opposing rows of geometrically regular five-story buildings.\r\nTo think of these, and then to turn to present-day Atlantis, was merely\r\nto shudder at the contrast; yet all the while I could not repress the\r\nsense that I was standing in the presence of something undefinably\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nIf it was somewhat irritating to gaze at the ruins of Sardolos,\r\nthe disagreeable moments were few indeed during the thirty days of\r\nthe journey. All in all, I have rarely taken part in so thoroughly\r\ndelightful an expedition; and my joy in the trip is not to be explained\r\nmerely by the engrossing sights of Atlantis, nor by the companionship\r\nof the twenty enthusiastic, friendly young students, but rather by\r\nthe presence of one who meant more to me than all else that Atlantis\r\ncontained. My opportunities of speaking with Aelios were not plentiful,\r\nfor she seemed always to be engaged in conversation with some member\r\nof the party; but occasionally I exchanged a few words with her,\r\nand occasionally she darted a bright smile in my direction, thereby\r\nreassuring me when at times I gave way to disturbing doubts.\r\n\r\nIt was not until our travels were drawing to a close that I had another\r\nintimate talk with her. The morning of the thirtieth day had arrived,\r\nand we had set out through wide fields of the wheat-like reed toward\r\nthe city of Archeon, which we hoped to reach shortly after noon. But,\r\nabsorbed in somber contemplation, I took no part in the merriment of\r\nmy companions, and almost from the first I lagged moodily behind them.\r\nHence it was a relief to hear light footsteps suddenly at my side, and\r\nto find a flaxen-curled head nodding a greeting and a pair of kindly\r\nbright blue eyes peering at me inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Aelios!” I exclaimed. And I returned her greeting in terms that could\r\nnot half express my pleasure.\r\n\r\nShe wasted no time about plunging into the subject that had brought her\r\nto me. “Today our journey ends,” she reminded me, almost regretfully.\r\n“And tomorrow you must take up your duties as a citizen. You may find\r\nmatters a little strange at first. Perhaps there are already some\r\nthings that puzzle you.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed there are,” I admitted. “I really have very little idea what I\r\nam expected to do.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you must have some idea!” she remonstrated. “Why, haven’t you\r\nbeen appointed Historian of the Upper World?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is so,” I murmured.\r\n\r\n“Then you must set out at once upon your duties. In work such as yours,\r\nno record will be taken of the hours you employ, but you have a moral\r\nobligation to work not less than two hours a day.”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t seem excessive,” I stated, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but remember you have also an obligation to do some work on your\r\nown account for the State. And things won’t be any easier, if, as you\r\nsay, you will combine your assigned and chosen work.”\r\n\r\n“The real problem,” I acknowledge hesitatingly, “is that I don’t know\r\nthe language well enough to write a history.”\r\n\r\nAelios frowned disapprovingly. “Oh, but you have already a good\r\nspeaking command of Atlantean,” she pointed out. “And with practice\r\nyou should be able to write passably well. Meanwhile I’d advise you to\r\ngo to the government library, and read up all you can to familiarize\r\nyourself with our language--and with our life.”\r\n\r\nI thanked Aelios for the suggestion, and promised to visit the library\r\nat the first opportunity.\r\n\r\n“But don’t forget that mere working and studying won’t be enough,”\r\nshe continued. “I hope you’ll make friends of many of our people, and\r\nparticipate in our intellectual contests and recreations. You might\r\neven join one of the political parties.”\r\n\r\n“Political parties?” I repeated. “I didn’t know there were any parties\r\nin Atlantis.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, of course there are,” she quickly returned. “There are\r\nalways several parties to present their opinions at the Hall of Public\r\nEnlightenment.”\r\n\r\n“What parties are those?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s see,” she enumerated, reflectively. “First of all,\r\nthere’s the Party of Submergence, so-called because it was founded\r\nby Agripides and has been the ruling group ever since the Good\r\nDestruction. Then there is the Industrial Reform Party, which\r\ncontends that all machines and in particular intra-atomic engines\r\nare incongruous in Atlantis and should be reduced to a minimum far\r\nbelow the present number. Then, again, there is the Party of Artistic\r\nEmancipation, which is really literary rather than political, and\r\nappeals for freedom in art. Also, there is the Party of Birth\r\nExtension, which maintains that the government should relax its\r\nrestrictions on population. And, finally, enlarging the principles\r\nof the Birth Extension Party, there is the Party of Emergence, which\r\nis the smallest of them all and has always been highly unpopular if\r\nnot actually despised, since it holds that we should renounce the\r\nprinciples of Agripides, enter into communication with the upper world,\r\nand send our excess population to live above seas.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds quite interesting,” I commented, for the Party of\r\nEmergence seemed to me to be the most understandable of the group. “But\r\nyou say this last party has never had much success?”\r\n\r\n“Fortunately not. Its members have always been looked down upon\r\nas anti-social agitators, for they have transgressed against\r\nthat fundamental principle, ‘Atlantis for the Atlanteans.’ Few\r\nself-respecting citizens have ever lent them support, and they have\r\nnever been powerful enough to carry any of their proposals.”\r\n\r\n“Too bad,” I found myself remarking, with unguarded frankness; and the\r\nshocked expression on Aelios’ face showed me how I had erred.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, now that you know something about the parties, you will\r\nbe better able to choose among them,” she concluded.\r\n\r\nI assured her that I would choose as best I could.\r\n\r\n“If there’s ever anything you’re in doubt about,” she urged, “don’t\r\nbe afraid to ask me. I know that things aren’t easy here for you, a\r\nstranger from a strange land, and I’d like to help if I could.”\r\n\r\nI thanked her fervently, and declared that I should not hesitate to\r\nconsult her should occasion arise. And secretly I was determined that\r\nthe occasion should arise.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to hear you say that,” she returned. And her eyes shone with\r\na bright light, and her lips quivered sympathetically, and her whole\r\nface radiated kindliness and warmth.\r\n\r\nBut at this juncture she saw fit to give the interview an impersonal\r\nturn. “See, over there!” she exclaimed, pointing through a break in the\r\ndense green foliage. “Those are the towers of Archeon!”\r\n\r\nI looked eagerly, and far across the plain I beheld a minute glittering\r\nspire, more than half obscured by the intervening array of tinted\r\ncolumns--the first sign of that city which I was this day to enter, and\r\nwhere I was to make my home, and seek the fulfillment of my love, and\r\nundertake my duties as a citizen of the Sunken World.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ... By degrees it lengthened until it seemed a long\r\njet of water shot horizontally out of some colossal hose. Intensely\r\nwhite, with the whiteness of foam and edges blurred with spray, it went\r\nhurtling with the impetuosity and swiftness of an arrow from the nozzle\r\nof a gigantic pipe, a plunging outward hundreds of yards in a graceful\r\nparabola and giving rise to the River.]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                                Xanocles\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an accredited citizen of Atlantis, I was assigned to permanent\r\nlodgings immediately after returning to Archeon. The housing\r\nrepresentative of the Atlantean government (the only substitute in the\r\nSunken World for our “realtors”) accompanied me on a leisurely tour\r\nof the city, allowing me my choice of not less than fifteen or twenty\r\napartments. The task of selection was by no means easy, not because\r\nit was hard to secure suitable quarters but because it was difficult\r\nto choose among so many desirable places. Never before had I realized\r\nhow utterly superior the Atlantean homes were to our own--out of all\r\nthe houses I visited, there was not one that was not separated by wide\r\nspaces from its neighbors, or that did not enjoy a full share of air\r\nand light, or that did not look comfortable and alluring. The grim and\r\nmusty interiors of many of our own dwellings, the furniture-littered\r\nrooms, the glaring bad taste of gilt and tinsel chairs and adornments,\r\nfound no parallel among the Atlantean residences I visited. Instead,\r\neach apartment was so artlessly inviting that I might have claimed it\r\nat once as my home.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of most of the Atlantean houses was a\r\ncentral court that reminded me of the dwellings of the ancient world.\r\nUsually the court was square or rectangular in shape, though in some\r\ninstances it was hexagonal or round; and more often than not it was\r\ncompletely enclosed. Some of the courts were surrounded by stalwart\r\ncolumns, but the majority were plain. Some had walls of granite, some\r\nof marble, some of a peculiar bluish stone that I could not recognize;\r\nsome were marked by spangled fountains, some by flower-gardens, some by\r\nswimming pools; and the most distinctive of all was arranged as an art\r\ngallery, with a dominating statue in the center and paintings hung at\r\nintervals along the sides. But whatever the particular contents of the\r\ncourt, it was certain to be accessible by four or five doors leading\r\ninto the several apartments.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting the various prospective lodgings, I finally decided in\r\nfavor of a little three-room suite (three rooms, that is, in addition\r\nto the sleeping chamber on the roof) which looked out over a tree-lined\r\nexpanse toward the sapphire dome of the Hall of Public Enlightenment.\r\nI was urged to take these quarters largely because of the fascination\r\nof the frieze-lined adjourning court, whose finely modelled images of\r\ngods and nymphs and satyrs offered me a prospect of fruitful study.\r\nBut I was also captivated by the rooms themselves, which gave a\r\nbizarre effect with their walls decked with seaweed tapestries, and\r\nwhich seemed at once like a home and a temple with their high vaulted\r\nceilings, their arching doorways and great elliptical windows, and\r\ntheir removable partitions capable of transforming the entire apartment\r\ninto a single good-sized hall.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate perhaps that I chose these particular lodgings, for\r\notherwise I might never have known Xanocles. Xanocles was to be my one\r\nintimate among all the men of Atlantis. It so happened that he--that\r\nfiery spirit, audacious thinker, and trustworthy friend--had chosen\r\nhis abode in the same building; and it also happened (since fate\r\nworks in inscrutable ways even in Atlantis) that he and I were early\r\nthrown together. It was, indeed, on the very day after my return to\r\nArcheon that Xanocles and I met. I had just settled in my new home,\r\nand had gone out into the court for my first close inspection of its\r\nmural decorations, when a door across from me slid open and a tall,\r\nwhite-clad figure emerged. A single glance would have told me that the\r\nstranger was exceptional, and a single glance perhaps told him that I\r\nwas exceptional in Atlantis: for he paused in startled surprise, and\r\nfor an embarrassed instant we stood staring inquiringly at one another.\r\nIn that first fleeting glimpse I had an impression of a powerful\r\npersonality; a large head poised squarely over a pair of broad and\r\ncapable shoulders; two vivid blue eyes deeply set beneath a massive\r\nbrow; a beardless oval face dominated by flowing chestnut locks;\r\nclassic features, with chin and nose consummately modelled. But I did\r\nnot notice then what I was often to observe later: the ironic glitter\r\nin the alert eyes, the forceful and determined lines into which the\r\nface would habitually settle, the air of overflowing vigor tempered by\r\nan easy self-command. Judging from the smooth contours of the man’s\r\nface, I took him to be not over thirty years of age; and I was later\r\nmuch surprised to learn that he was well past forty (since in Atlantis\r\npeople do not age so rapidly as on earth).\r\n\r\n“By Agripides! You must be one of those visitors from up above!”\r\nexclaimed the newcomer, recovering from his astonishment. And he\r\napproached me with a winning smile, and held out both hands by way of\r\ngreeting. “My name is Xanocles. We seem to be neighbors, you and I.\r\nPerhaps we can get to know each other.”\r\n\r\n“I hope we shall,” I seconded, as I took his hands. “My name is\r\nHarkness. I’ve just finished my tour around Atlantis, and now I’m\r\nsupposed to begin duty as a citizen.”\r\n\r\n“That’s quick work,” nodded Xanocles, approvingly. And then, after an\r\ninstant’s pause, “So you’re the one they’ve appointed Historian of the\r\nUpper World?”\r\n\r\nI pleaded guilty to the accusation.\r\n\r\n“I knew it must be so,” explained my new acquaintance, “because only\r\none of the immigrants has been admitted to citizenship. Of course,\r\nthere will be others later on.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you come in?” I invited, with a gesture toward my new apartments.\r\n\r\nXanocles needed no second invitation. A minute later we were seated\r\nopposite one another on seaweed cushions in the little room that was to\r\nbe my study.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me, Harkness,” he suggested, using my name as familiarly\r\nas though he had known me all my life, “we might as well be frank with\r\none another from the beginning. At least, I might as well be frank with\r\nyou. And I’d better start by warning you that you’ll not gain much from\r\nacquaintance with me. I’m none too popular.”\r\n\r\n“No?” I demanded, wondering vaguely what offense he had committed.\r\n\r\n“No,” he confessed. “I’m so very unpopular, in fact, that it may\r\nreflect upon you even to be seen in my company.”\r\n\r\n“But what is it that you’ve done?” I asked, thinking it strange that\r\nthis attractive and able-looking man should be so disliked. “Surely,\r\nyou haven’t blown up a building, or stolen some one’s jewels, or killed\r\na man--”\r\n\r\nA frown of disgust passed across Xanocles’ face. “Such primitive forms\r\nof violence,” he reminded me, “are unknown in Atlantis. No, I haven’t\r\nstooped to anything so low. But I’ve done something bad enough in the\r\neyes of the people.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll have to give it up,” said I, growing more puzzled each moment.\r\n\r\n“It shouldn’t be hard to guess--not if you know the ways of Atlantis,”\r\nhe continued, gravely. “I’ve joined the Party of Emergence.”\r\n\r\n“The Party of Emergence?” I exclaimed, remembering what Aelios had told\r\nme of this minority group.\r\n\r\n“I not only joined the party,” he acknowledged, completing the\r\nindictment, “but I’ve let them elect me one of their Debating\r\nDelegates.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t exactly understand--” I admitted, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“You would understand if you knew more about Atlantis. Every people has\r\nto have its pet aversion, I suppose, and our pet aversion down here is\r\nthe Emergence Party. That’s because it opposes the principles of the\r\none hundred per cent Atlanteans.”\r\n\r\n“But just what is the Emergence Party?” I inquired, still in doubt as\r\nto the tenets of this detested faction. “Is it anything so terrible?”\r\n\r\n“That all depends upon the point of view,” declared Xanocles,\r\nenigmatically.\r\n\r\nHe paused long enough to give me an instant’s scrutiny with keen and\r\nquizzical eyes. “I am not sure that you would understand,” he decided,\r\nspeaking as much to himself as to me. “But the main thing is that we\r\noppose the compulsory limitation of population.”\r\n\r\n“Compulsory limitation of population?” I repeated, wondering if I had\r\nheard him correctly.\r\n\r\n“Most certainly. You’ve heard, perhaps, that our population is limited\r\nby law to five hundred thousand.”\r\n\r\n“But that’s impossible!” I cried, incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Experience has proved quite the contrary,” he dissented.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment I did not reply. I merely sat staring at my companion,\r\ntrying to fathom the secret hidden in those inscrutable grave eyes of\r\nhis. And though he gave no sign of not being utterly truthful, I ended\r\nby giving expression to my scepticism.\r\n\r\n“What do you do with your extra inhabitants? Do they emigrate to the\r\ncenter of the earth? Or do you prefer to shoot them or drown them, or\r\nperhaps to asphyxiate them humanely?”\r\n\r\n“There are no extra inhabitants,” was the surprising reply. “Do you\r\nknow nothing of the Milares Compulsory Population Law?”\r\n\r\nI was forced to confess my ignorance.\r\n\r\n“Then let me enlighten you,” volunteered Xanocles, with a tolerant\r\nsmile. “First let me take you back a few thousand years, to the days\r\njust after the Submergence. At that time the population of Atlantis\r\nwas several millions, and the swarms of our people were so dense that\r\nlong hours of labor were necessary, living quarters were crowded and\r\nunsanitary, and there was little time for the creation or appreciation\r\nof beauty. This state of affairs endured for over a century, when,\r\nafter much discussion, the Milares Compulsory Population Law was\r\npassed, and the citizenry was gradually reduced to its present\r\nsatisfactory numbers.”\r\n\r\n“And what was the Milares Population Law?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It is the law that is still the backbone of our life. According to\r\nMilares, a great social philosopher of the second century A. S., the\r\nmost important of public questions is that of parentage. He maintained\r\nthat the parents of each generation might either poison or uplift the\r\nnext; and all of his numerous pamphlets and books bore the warning\r\nthat persons congenitally deficient in mind or physique should not be\r\npermitted to breed, while those of the higher physical and intellectual\r\nqualities should be encouraged.\r\n\r\n“In pursuance of these views, Milares proposed a basic innovation in\r\nsocial customs; he recommended that the institution of marriage be\r\ndissevered from that of parenthood. In other words, while marriage--and\r\nlikewise divorce--should be permitted to all that desired it,\r\nparenthood should become a subject of drastic state regulation: any\r\nyoung couple wishing, children must have their fitness examined by\r\na carefully selected State board. Since effective methods of birth\r\ncontrol were known, this system was wholly practicable, and, in fact,\r\nhas proved--”\r\n\r\n“But what if the orders of the Board were disobeyed?” I interrupted.\r\n“Certainly, the unlawful newcomer couldn’t be punished.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. But a stigma would attach to the parents--the stain of\r\nillegitimacy.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that the parents would be considered illegitimate?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. And the disgrace is so great that few persons have ever\r\noffended in that way. As a result, we have never at any time exceeded\r\nthe prescribed population by more than ten or twelve thousands.”\r\n\r\n“Even so,” I contended, rather vaguely, “it seems to me that such a\r\nsystem would be altogether too arbitrary to succeed.”\r\n\r\n“Yet it has succeeded splendidly. The experience of nearly three\r\nthousand years has vindicated it beyond dispute. Do you think that,\r\nat the time of the Submergence our men and women enjoyed such\r\nperfection of physical beauty as today? Or do you imagine that the\r\nintellectual and artistic types were then predominant? Far from it!\r\nThousands upon thousands were sickly and stunted in body; a myriad\r\nwere imbecilic, weak-minded or insane. But thanks to the rigidity of\r\nthe selection, these types have been entirely eliminated; and, owing\r\nlargely to the same cause, the average human life has been lengthened\r\nfrom the pre-Submergence figure of sixty-five years to a hundred and\r\ntwenty--which means that the man of ability has a whole century of\r\nmature service to render instead of a mere four, or five decades.”\r\n\r\nI had no choice except to admit that the results were marvelous. But at\r\nthe same time I remembered a vital oversight in Xanocles’ recitation.\r\n“All this tells me nothing of the Party of Emergence,” I pointed out.\r\n“In fact, if the Milares Population Law has worked so successfully, I\r\ncannot understand why you should oppose it.”\r\n\r\n“It would not be strictly correct to say that we oppose it,” he\r\nexplained. “We recognize its beneficent results, but we believe\r\nthat the time has come to modify it. Not that we would increase the\r\npopulation of Atlantis beyond the half million mark, for that would\r\nbe to impose an intolerable burden upon us all; but we hold that many\r\ndeserving persons are being deprived of parenthood, and that many more\r\nchildren of the highest quality might be born. To furnish a simple\r\nillustration, the Board seems to believe it unwise to perpetuate the\r\nradical strains, and so rules with suspicious frequency against members\r\nof the Party of Emergence.”\r\n\r\n“Then precisely what is it that your party advocates?” I questioned.\r\n\r\n“Just what our name implies: to let our surplus population emerge into\r\nthe upper world. That would be easily possible, for the submersible\r\nrepair ships that range the ocean about the glass wall would be capable\r\nof conveying us above seas. Of course, there might be no possibility\r\nof a return, but a return would not be desirable: it would be enough\r\nto insure life for thousands of our unborn sons and daughters, and to\r\nremake the upper world by an infiltration of our superior blood and\r\nstandards. Besides,”--here Xanocles hesitated perceptibly--“there is\r\nanother reason.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” I felt bound to inquire.\r\n\r\nXanocles remained silent for a moment, staring abstractedly toward\r\nthe romping fauns and mermaids on the seaweed tapestries of the\r\nopposite wall. Then slowly he resumed, “We hold--and in this we are\r\nviolently combated by our friends of the Submergence Party--that there\r\nwas one minor flaw in the plans of Agripides. In a thousand respects\r\nhis projects were perfect; but we believe that in the thousandth and\r\nfirst he made an oversight--perhaps an unavoidable oversight. He did\r\nnot leave room enough in Atlantis for adventure. Everything here is\r\nso well designed that there is little chance for daring courage, the\r\nunknown--little chance for sheer primitive rashness and hardihood.\r\nOur games and recreations, our art, our political contests, of course\r\nconsume much of our surplus energy; but, after all, we are the children\r\nof savage ancestors, and among our young there is a craving for keener\r\nexperience. And so we of the Emergence Party favor the increase of\r\npopulation, so that those who wish may enjoy the greatest adventure of\r\nall--may launch their vessels toward unknown worlds!”\r\n\r\n“You would find that adventure well worth taking,” I commented.\r\n\r\n“Then you--you perhaps agree with the Party of Emergence?” cried\r\nXanocles, rising and coming toward me enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I do,” I admitted, also rising, and taking his extended hands.\r\nAnd as I felt his hearty clasp, it seemed to me that I had not only\r\ngained a friend but found my political allegiance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                        What the Books Revealed\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid all the excitement of my return to Archeon, my establishment\r\nin new quarters and my meeting with Xanocles, I had not forgotten\r\nAelios’ advice to visit the library at the first opportunity. Nor had I\r\nforgotten my official duties as Historian of the Upper World, nor the\r\nnecessity for acquiring more, explicit knowledge of undersea customs\r\nbefore I could hope to interpret my own country to the Atlanteans.\r\nHence I was determined to accomplish a double object: to prepare myself\r\nfor my prescribed work and at the same time to gratify my curiosity by\r\nan extensive course of reading.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was fully settled in my new apartment, I set out for the\r\nmain government library--and with highly interesting and even startling\r\nresults. I found the building without difficulty: a many-domed edifice\r\nof granite and white chalcedony, located in a large flower-bordered\r\nsquare near the center of town. Had I not been able to identify it from\r\nthe descriptions, I might have recognized it by the streams of people\r\nconstantly filing in and out, giving me the feeling that it was the\r\nbusiness heart of the city.\r\n\r\nYet my first impressions of the library were bewildering in the\r\nextreme. Not only was the building one of the largest I had seen\r\n(covering not less than five or six acres) but the volumes it harbored\r\nwere amazing in their profusion and variety. My first surprise was at\r\nthe discovery that there were no railings, fences or locked doors,\r\nas in all other libraries I had known. Here the visitor was admitted\r\nwithout question to every room and corridor; my second surprise--and\r\na far greater one--was caused by the queer arrangement of the books.\r\nFor the volumes were catalogued and stocked, not alphabetically, but\r\nchronologically; there was a gallery reserved for each century of\r\nAtlantean history, down to the seventh century B. S.; and within the\r\ngalleries, the books were arranged by authors and subjects in a way\r\nthat impressed me as utterly novel. In a niche among the books, for\r\nexample, one would observe the bust of a stern-browed, bearded man;\r\nand, coming close, one would note that this was the poet Sargos; and\r\njust below the bust one would find the complete collection of the\r\npoet’s works, as well as the commentaries upon them. Or, in another\r\ncorner of the room, one would pause to admire the painting of a crowded\r\nancient seaport; and the inscription below the painting would tell one\r\nthat this was the vanished maritime city of Therion; and just beneath\r\nthis inscription would be the books wherein Therion was pictured and\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nIn a way, the building reminded me of a museum as much as of a\r\nlibrary, for, in addition to the paintings and statues, each gallery\r\nwas featured by furniture, rugs, vases, tapestries and decorations\r\nthat corresponded with the original date of the books. The effect of\r\noddity was enhanced by the fact that the volumes themselves, while in\r\nmany cases modern reprints, were not infrequently bound in the style\r\nof their first editions; and the total impression was most curious\r\nand interesting, considering the contrasting sizes and the numberless\r\nshades and colors of the books, and the various grades of silk,\r\nparchment and artificial leather in which they were attired.\r\n\r\nYet the appearance of the books was the least noteworthy fact about\r\nthem. Their sheer abundance was a source of unceasing astonishment\r\nto me--it seemed as if every era in Atlantean history had been a\r\nliterary one. As nearly as I could determine, there had been an average\r\nof several hundred books a year which had been thought worthy of\r\npreservation--and the high period of productivity had already endured\r\nfor twenty-five centuries! Nor were the favored works merely stored\r\nup in dusty shelves where they might remain forever unnoticed--every\r\nbook of the scores which I opened had been well thumbed, and the crowds\r\nconstantly browsing along the alcoves and aisles gave evidence that\r\nliterary interest was not purely a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before I myself felt inclined to emulate those\r\nenthusiasts. Seated in company with twenty or thirty Atlanteans before\r\nthe long marble table that adorned the most modern of the galleries, I\r\nbegan to taste the contents of several books I had selected at random;\r\nand so delightful did they prove, that it was four or five hours before\r\nI had any thought of leaving.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile all the books which I inspected proved richly diverting, the one\r\nthat interested me most was a little volume entitled “Social Life in\r\nthe Thirty-first Century.” When I recall today the unusual size of the\r\ntype and the extreme simplicity of the style, I feel sure that the book\r\nwas designed for an immature audience; but this fact did not then occur\r\nto me, and I found the work admirably suited to my needs. Questions\r\nthat had been perplexing me ever since my arrival in Atlantis were now\r\nexplained, in a manner that dispersed all doubts; and I found myself\r\npossessed of a clearer conception than ever before of Atlantean ideas\r\nand institutions.\r\n\r\nI had been wondering, for example, about the statue-like palace\r\nwherein Rawson and I had been imprisoned; I was now informed that\r\nthis, “The Temple of the Stars,” was among the oldest buildings in\r\nAtlantis, having been erected just before the Submergence so that the\r\npeople might bring back to mind at will the aspect of the skies. I had\r\nbeen wondering, likewise, about the “Hall of Public Enlightenment,”\r\nthat amber-hued and sapphire theatre in which I had lately witnessed\r\nseveral debates; I now read that such a building had been erected\r\ncenturies before in each of the Atlantean cities as a place of popular\r\nassemblage, a sort of forum, wherein the people might decide upon\r\npublic questions; and I also learned that any citizen might attend the\r\nmeetings there, that any might take part in the discussions, and that\r\nit was at such popular gatherings that the few laws of the country were\r\nproposed and the most important problems weighed and settled.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the Halls of Public Enlightenment naturally paved\r\nthe way for a description of the political system and government of the\r\nSunken World. “The State of Atlantis,” I read, “is neither a monarchy,\r\nan oligarchy, nor a republic. It is a Commonality, which means that\r\nall things are possessed in common by the people and all activities\r\nshared among them. At the head of the Atlantean State is the High Chief\r\nAdviser, whose principle duty is by way of counseling the people, but\r\nwho decides certain specified minor questions confronting the Atlantean\r\nState and is empowered to assume dictatorial authority in case of a\r\nnational crisis (although such a crisis has never occurred since the\r\nriots of the second century A. S., following the passage of the Milares\r\nCompulsory Population Law).\r\n\r\n“Like all the other officials of Atlantis, the High Chief Adviser\r\nassumes his position neither by appointment nor by heredity nor by\r\nelection, but by Automatic Selection; or, in other words, he has taken\r\noffice after defeating all rivals in a series of debates and rigorous\r\ncompetitive examinations. His term of office is indefinite, but every\r\nthree years he is expected to prove his fitness by engaging in contests\r\nwith qualified aspirants for the Advisorship; and unless he can still\r\noutdo all opponents, a new chief executive is installed.”\r\n\r\nIt would have seemed to me that such a system would have detracted\r\nfrom the dignity of the High Chief Adviser; but the book informed me\r\nthat, on the contrary, it added to his dignity, since he was assured\r\nof holding office on a basis of merit only. In fact, he was bound to\r\nkeep fit and even to improve himself while in office; and most High\r\nChief Advisers did actually remain so well qualified that they stayed\r\nin power for an average term of thirty years. Indeed, Icenocles (the\r\nincumbent at the time of the publication of the book) had already ruled\r\nfor forty-five years, and now, at the mature age of one hundred and\r\nseven, he still regularly put all competitors to shame.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, told me nothing about Atlantean law-making, law\r\nenforcement and the administration of justice. Therefore I eagerly\r\nread on, and found many of my questions speedily answered. To my\r\nastonishment, I learned that there was no such thing as a legislature\r\nor a law-making group in Atlantis!--and yet such bodies were not\r\nunknown to the native political theory. “Ancient experience has taught\r\nus,” said the book, “that representative government usually represents\r\nonly some particular faction. And in a community whose members are\r\nfew and all of whose citizens are intelligent, there is no necessity\r\nfor delegated authority. Local statutes and ordinances were abolished\r\nin Atlantis at the time of the Submergence; and the few national laws\r\nare proposed in any of the cities in the Hall of Public Enlightenment.\r\nHaving been debated and approved by an assemblage of a hundred citizens\r\nor more, the measure is submitted to a referendum of all the Atlanteans\r\nafter the lapse of thirty days--and a majority vote will suffice for\r\nits passage.\r\n\r\n“At the head of each city is a Local Adviser, selected in the same\r\nmanner as the High Chief Adviser; and, aided by a corps of from five\r\nto fifteen assistants also chosen competitively, he decides those\r\nquestions not settled in the popular assemblies,--questions such as\r\nthe amount of energy to be devoted to the erection of new buildings,\r\nthe time and nature of local festivals, the regulation of local\r\nhygienic problems, the number of public physicians required to attend\r\nthe ill and aged, and a dozen other matters of practical and artistic\r\nconcern. Equally important theoretically, though in actual practice far\r\nless so, is the court of eleven judges which presides in each town,\r\nsettling all disputes among citizens and reprimanding the law-breakers.\r\nNo doubt there were frequently such persons as law-breakers three\r\nthousand years ago, when these courts were planned, but today such\r\noffenders are virtually unknown, for the only crimes are those of\r\nimpulse and passion, and these are exceedingly rare--fortunately,\r\nthe congenital criminals have been wiped out along with lunatics and\r\nmorons by our rigorous birth selection. Occasionally, indeed, some\r\ndiseased person will break some unwritten rule of society, such as\r\nthat against trapping or slaying fishes or small animals; but the\r\ngovernment hospitals care for such unfortunates, just as they care\r\nfor the criminals of impulse, and not infrequently effect a cure. As\r\nfor disputes among individuals, they are as obsolete as embezzlement\r\nor highway robbery, for now that the ownership of property has been\r\nabolished, what is there left to quarrel about? And so for the most\r\npart our courts endure somewhat as the appendix endures in the human\r\nbody--mere anachronistic reminders of an age that is no more.”\r\n\r\nAt a single sitting I read my book from cover to cover. Even aside\r\nfrom what I have already mentioned, the facts that it told me were\r\ninnumerable and highly varied: how the great golden lamps of Atlantis\r\nwere electrically lighted and were switched on and off at specified\r\nintervals by country-wide clockwork; how all Atlanteans, old and\r\nyoung, ill and healthy, were cared for by the State, so that no man\r\nwas weighed down with dependents; how disease had been almost wiped\r\nout, since all the commoner noxious germs had been conquered; how\r\nreligion in the organized sense had ceased to exist, for the reason\r\nthat each man was expected to arrive at his own philosophy; how the\r\ntemples that littered the country were without theological meaning, but\r\nwere sanctuaries of beauty whereto any one might come at any time to\r\nworship amid the solitude of his own thoughts; how education was one\r\nof the prime pursuits of the people, and was participated in by all\r\nfrom childhood to old age, but was never undertaken by the mob method\r\npopular in the upper world.\r\n\r\nFrom the few pages that the author of the “Social Life” devoted to\r\nthe latter subject, I feel sure that the Atlanteans would have been\r\nhorrified at our system of herding forty or fifty children together in\r\nsubjection to a glowering pedagogue: their theory was that personal and\r\nfriendly contact with the teacher was the important thing, and so their\r\nboys and girls were taught in small groups, and never for many hours\r\na day, nor with more than a minimum of restraint upon their natural\r\nspirits, nor in a specified and unvarying place, for as often as not\r\ntheir school-room was a marble colonnade or the court of a temple\r\nor even the open fields. And, in the same way, the higher education\r\namong the Atlanteans (except in the case of scientific work requiring\r\nlaboratory training) was much less formal than among us. There were no\r\nsuch things as universities or university degrees, but men and women of\r\nrecognized wisdom and learning were chosen to commune with the young\r\nand discuss with them the problems of life, much as Socrates did when\r\nhe presided among his disciples; and these “Guardians of the Mind,” as\r\nthey were called, would counsel and direct their young charges, and\r\nguide them in that reading which constituted their primary source of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                          Duties and Pastimes\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is from my first visit to the library that I date my real\r\ninitiation into the affairs of Atlantis. From that time forth I was\r\nno longer a stranger in an unknown world; I became involved in such a\r\nround of activities that I began to feel almost at home. For it was my\r\ngood fortune to have plenty to do, far more to do, in fact, than the\r\naverage Atlantean; and with the demands of the Sunken World calling me\r\non the one hand, and my old companions of the X-111 drawing me on the\r\nother, I did not have far to seek for an interest in life.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, of course, I was applying myself to my “History of the\r\nUpper World.” It took me a month to plan the book, though meanwhile I\r\ndevoted hours a day to improving my knowledge of the Atlantean language\r\nand institutions. And when finally I had completed my preliminary\r\noutline it did not satisfy me entirely, and yet seemed adequate as a\r\nworking basis. The introductory section of the book--necessarily a\r\nlengthy affair--was to be devoted to a description of the modern world,\r\nto the various nations, their customs, languages, social systems,\r\nscientific advances and wars; and having begun with this grand resume\r\nof modern achievement, I intended to show the steps by which that\r\nachievement had been consummated, and to picture in general the course\r\nof those social fluctuations, those invasions, battles, slave-raids,\r\ncivil conflicts, religious persecutions, crusades, economic\r\nrevolutions, industrial tumults and international blood-feuds that have\r\nbrought civilisation to its present proud estate.\r\n\r\nBut while I was planning my book, my thoughts were frequently on more\r\npersonal subjects. And, having completed the outline, I could not\r\nforget a certain invitation made me by the most fascinating woman in\r\nAtlantis, but wasted no time about seeking her advice and approval.\r\n\r\nLate one afternoon, when I knew that her tutoring would be over for\r\nthe day, I paid my second visit to her home. I went just a little\r\nhesitatingly, I remember, yet not without some justifiable hope, for\r\nour interview was to begin most auspiciously. It was Aelios herself\r\nthat came to the door in response to my knock; and it was Aelios that\r\nescorted me into the house, with cordial greetings and delighted smiles\r\nthat reaffirmed my impression of her unrivaled merits.\r\n\r\n“Well, my friend, I thought you would be coming,” said she, simply, as\r\nwe took seats side by side on the seaweed sofa we had occupied on my\r\nfirst visit.\r\n\r\n“But what made you think that?” I questioned.\r\n\r\n“Why, didn’t you say you would come?” she returned, in unfeigned\r\nsurprise. “You’re undertaking a difficult task, you know--to write a\r\nbook in a strange language. Isn’t it only natural to want advice?”\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed,” I confessed, and should have liked to add, “when I can\r\nhave such a charming adviser.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’ve been working hard,” she continued, evidently unaware\r\nof what was in my thoughts. “And, of course, you’ve brought something\r\nwith you to show me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have brought something,” I admitted; and, there being no\r\nchoice, I forthwith unfolded the paper that contained my plans for the\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes she gazed at it intently, her features furrowed\r\nwith thought, while eagerly I awaited her verdict.\r\n\r\n“This is going to be very interesting,” she at length decided. “As far\r\nas I can see, you’ve covered most of the important points. You will\r\nfind it easier than I thought to write in our language--your beginning\r\nis most promising. Of course, you do make some errors of style....” And\r\nshe proceeded to point out my mistakes, in such a manner that I felt\r\ncertain never to repeat them.\r\n\r\nFor possibly an hour--or two--we discussed my outline, though all the\r\nwhile I was conscious that there was something in Atlantis far more\r\ninteresting to me than my book.\r\n\r\nI was still aware of that fact, when, at last, feeling that it was\r\ngrowing late, I arose reluctantly to leave. As she took my hand, Aelios\r\nflashed upon me her most genial smile, and requested, “Come again,\r\nmy friend. Perhaps I’ll be able to help you some more. Our doors are\r\nalways open, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if it wouldn’t be asking too much of you,” I started to reply,\r\nfumbling for words, while the blood rushed all at once to my head.\r\n\r\n“It will be a pleasure. And besides,”--here she hesitated momentarily,\r\nand her fingers absently toyed with the folds of her gown--“besides, if\r\nI help you with your book, I will also be helping the State.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, possibly that’s true,” I conceded. And so what could I do but\r\nagree to give Aelios a further opportunity to help the State?\r\n\r\nBut if I based any glamorous hopes upon her evident friendliness, I was\r\nbuilding without knowledge of my foundations. Not long after my visit\r\nto her, a chance conversation showed me how far I was from that goal\r\nwhich my more sanguine fancies pictured.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Xanocles that unwittingly made me see the difficulties. During\r\none of our numerous little talks, he touched casually upon the marriage\r\nsystem of Atlantis. “The Milares Compulsory Population Law,” he\r\nchanced to inform me, “is perhaps not the only reason for the present\r\nsuperiority of the Atlantean stock. Another factor is what I may call\r\nthe marital selection. This is regulated primarily by custom and is\r\nalmost exclusively in the hands of the women, yet is so rigid that an\r\ninferior man can hardly find a mate--indeed, a superior woman would be\r\ndisgraced by linking herself to a weakling.”\r\n\r\n“But just what do you mean by a weakling?” I inquired.\r\n\r\nXanocles looked at me in surprise. “A weakling, of course, is one with\r\nnothing to give to society. A great poet, for example, could never be\r\nthought of as a weakling; nor a competent painter, nor philosopher,\r\nnor musician, nor biologist. But the man whose contributions show no\r\nparticular skill or individuality is regarded as a weakling, no matter\r\nwhat his pursuit. Naturally, he is not condemned so long as he does his\r\nbest; but he is not regarded as a fit subject for marriage except with\r\nanother weakling--and, needless to say, weaklings are not permitted to\r\npropagate.”\r\n\r\nIf Xanocles noticed that I was moody and silent for the rest of the\r\nday, the reason would not have been hard to find. I do not believe\r\nthat, in my own world, I had ever suffered from what is known as an\r\ninferiority complex; but among the Atlanteans, with their higher\r\nstandards, mere honesty demanded that I question my own qualifications.\r\nAnd what, I wondered, had I to offer to a woman such as Aelios? Would\r\nnot my meagre attainments appear childish and unattractive to her?\r\nEven if I finished my “History of the Upper World,” would it not be a\r\nsecond-rate affair, altogether incapable of winning her admiration? And\r\nwould I not, by comparison with the natives, be considered a weakling,\r\na man whom Aelios could not marry without incurring disgrace?\r\n\r\nFor days and weeks I was harassed by such thoughts; and it was to be\r\nlong before I had wholly recovered. Meanwhile, however, I was partially\r\nconsoled by the companionship of Xanocles. The friendship begun at\r\nour first meeting, was strengthening and solidifying in the course\r\nof the months; the proximity of our lodgings rendered it easy for us\r\nto see one another, but there also seemed to be a certain proximity\r\nof mind, which made each of us take pleasure in the company of the\r\nother; and in spite of the gulf of race, training and experience, we\r\nfound that we actually had more in common than many persons who have\r\nspent all their lives in the same home. And so he would often seek me\r\nout, and we would spend hours exchanging ideas in the dim seclusion of\r\nmy rooms; and often I would seek him out, and we would hold friendly\r\ndebate in the quiet of his rooms; and not infrequently we might have\r\nbeen seen strolling arm in arm about the city, while I pictured to him\r\nthe wonders and vastness of the upper world, or while he in his turn\r\nregaled me with colorful reminiscences, and told how he was employed by\r\nthe State as a binder and designer of books, but how he spent his spare\r\ntime in writing economic and philosophical treatises or delivering\r\nlectures in favor of the Emergence.\r\n\r\nIt was under the pilotage of Xanocles that I was introduced to the\r\nsocial life of Atlantis. The Atlanteans did not spend all their time\r\nin grave and serious pursuits, as I had at first imagined; they did\r\nnot devote themselves to art until it palled upon them, or seek for\r\nbeauty until it became blurred and illusory; but they knew how to vary\r\ntheir lives and make them symmetrical, and they had quite as much time\r\nfor laughter and recreation as for earnest endeavor and sober thought.\r\nIndeed, they proved to be an unusually sociable people; and after\r\nI had entered with Xanocles into the rare spirit of their life and\r\npastimes, I was forced to conclude that a prime reason for the success\r\nof Atlantean society was the sane balance it preserved, and the fact\r\nthat its more ideal aims were tempered by a recognition and a measured\r\nencouragement of all the normal inclinations of man.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor sheer range and variety, the Atlantean pastimes excelled those of\r\nany other people I had ever encountered. To begin with the simplest\r\nfirst, there were athletic games, races and competitions that might\r\nhave been popular even in the upper world; and on the outskirts of\r\nArcheon were fields where the young and even the middle-aged gathered\r\nin crowds, testing their prowess by boxing and wrestling, by hurling\r\nround, flat objects like the ancient discus, by sprinting along\r\nspecified race-courses, by engaging in a sort of ball game remotely\r\nlike tennis, or by participating in that more popular contest known as\r\n“sortos,” which reminded me of baseball except for the fact that it\r\ndid not require so many players. I was surprised to observe that the\r\nAtlanteans could enter into these sports with hot enthusiasm; but I\r\nalso noted that they could view their athletics with sanity, and were\r\ninterested in their games only while actually engaged in them, and did\r\nnot come forth in throngs as mere onlookers, nor waste time discussing\r\nthe contests beforehand or after they were over, nor prostitute their\r\nspirit to a professional or commercial outlook.\r\n\r\nNot less popular than the athletics--in fact, probably much more\r\npopular--were the dances that featured prominently in Atlantean life.\r\nThese were of a hundred styles and varieties, from the ethereal\r\nbutterfly movements of trained women, such as Aelios, to the tripping\r\nand capering of children keeping time spontaneously to the rhythm of\r\na song. Leaving out of account the dances for which unusual skill was\r\nnecessary, the most interesting to my mind were those held on the\r\npolished floors of the temples, where as many as a hundred men and\r\nwomen would gather, all swaying synchronously to the subdued beat of\r\nthe music, some in couples holding hands and some singly, but all\r\nlightly passing back and forth with bird-like co-ordinated movements,\r\nuntil as one watched, one lost sight of individuals and thought of them\r\nall only as the parts of some exquisite, ever-varying whole.\r\n\r\nIt was not surprising to me to observe that the Atlantean love of the\r\ndance was matched by an equal taste for music. Having no technical\r\nmusical knowledge, I cannot comment upon the Atlantean development\r\nof the art, except to say that its cultivation was widespread, that\r\npublic concerts were held almost daily in the halls of Archeon, and\r\nthat invariably their effect upon me was pleasing beyond anything I had\r\never heard on earth. Perhaps it was that the Atlantean music possessed\r\nin high degree the power of awakening ecstasy and visions; perhaps it\r\nwas that its restrained melancholy and plaintive rapture were as keys,\r\nthat unlocked a universe beyond the universe of sense, and brought the\r\ntime-bound spirit into touch with the timeless; but, at all events, it\r\npossessed a ravishing power reminding me of the most consummate violin\r\nperformances, and yet surpassing even the violin in the almost complete\r\nseverance it effected between body and soul.\r\n\r\nMuch the same may be said of the drama in Atlantis--a drama almost as\r\npopular as the music, and built like the music upon that beauty which\r\nreaches beyond time and space. The prose drama seems never to have been\r\nintroduced; poetry, as the natural vehicle for ecstatic expression,\r\nwas evidently regarded as the inevitable substance of all plays; and\r\nthe playwrights were all in a tradition that might have appealed to\r\nSophocles and Euripides, although they had never heard of those master\r\ndramatists. Indeed, Atlantis had a score of dramatic writers who in\r\nmy judgment were in no way inferior to any produced by classical\r\nGreece; and the best works of these authors, staged with picturesque\r\nsimplicity and presented by actors of power, afforded me some of the\r\nmost absorbing hours I passed during all my years in Atlantis.\r\n\r\nBut if delighted by such performances, I was not less pleased to note\r\nthat dramatics flourished also on a small scale. In any little social\r\ngathering one of the most popular diversions would be the improvisation\r\nand acting of short plays; and the proficiency of the Atlanteans in\r\nthis game seemed almost incredible to me, for the actors would not only\r\noriginate their own little dramas, but would speak their impromptu\r\nlines with feeling and beauty; and so deeply was the spirit of poetry\r\nengrained that long fluent passages of exceptional verse would\r\nsometimes be delivered spontaneously.\r\n\r\nBeyond these dramatic exhibitions, the chief private pastime of the\r\nAtlanteans was in the art of discussion. To say that discussion was an\r\nart is not to exaggerate; it was believed that the mark of the cultured\r\nman was his ability to express himself intelligently; and themes for\r\nconsideration in an Atlantean drawing room varied from the latest\r\npoetry and the latest music to the nature of the human personality\r\nand the ultimate meaning of life. To the self-respecting citizen, it\r\nwould have been an insult to suggest that he avoid the boredom of\r\nconversation by games of dominoes or cards; and it would have seemed\r\nludicrous to attempt to gossip concerning one’s food or clothes, one’s\r\nathletic prowess, one’s neighbor’s idiosyncrasies or bad manners, or\r\nany of those hundred and one subjects that might have proved diverting\r\nin upper world conversation.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Xanocles was introducing me to the social life of Atlantis, much\r\nof my time was being taken up by social life of a different type. Now\r\nthat I had been elevated to the dignity of Atlantean citizenship, I\r\ncould not forget that I had thirty-eight comrades who aspired to a\r\nsimilar honor. I saw fully as much of my former shipmates as before;\r\nindeed, I saw some of them more than ever, and in particular Captain\r\nGavison, who would frequently visit me to exchange reminiscences; and I\r\nrubbed shoulders with the whole crew at the regular bi-weekly meetings\r\nof the Upper World Club, which were now held in my apartment.\r\n\r\nThese meetings were sometimes exciting affairs, perhaps because\r\nthere was little else in Atlantis which offered the possibility of\r\nexcitement. Looking back after the lapse of years, it is not easy\r\nfor me to recall just what there was to be agitated about; but it is\r\ncertain that we would be agitated indeed, and that there would be fiery\r\ndebates and discussions, which occasionally became so heated that\r\nPresident Gavison would rap and rap with the bit of stone that served\r\nhim as gavel, raising his voice until he almost shouted and the sheer\r\nawe of his presence would restore order. As nearly as I can remember,\r\nmost of the disputes were due to conflicting opinions of Atlantis; for\r\nfrequently one of the club members would denounce the Sunken World\r\nin the most picturesque terms at his disposal; and immediately some\r\nchampion of Atlantis would spring to his feet in disagreement, and the\r\ndebate would wax fast and furious, most of the club taking a part,\r\nuntil the imperious voice of the President would put an end to the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the altercation would be over some proposal for\r\nimproving our status in Atlantis. Many and curious were the views as\r\nto the drawbacks of our lot; and one of our members would be likely\r\nto suggest that we attempt the construction of a motor boat or of an\r\nautomobile; and another would be convinced that a prime shortcoming of\r\nAtlantis was the absence of the phonograph or of motion pictures; and\r\nmany would toy fondly with the idea of escape, and would advocate wild\r\nand wholly impractical schemes that would foment a tumult in the club.\r\nAs time went by, it became increasingly apparent that the majority\r\nwould never be reconciled to Atlantis; they felt estranged by its art,\r\noverwhelmed by its majesty, irritated by its suave peacefulness; and\r\nwhile they still studied the native language for several hours a day,\r\nand at times derived much satisfaction from being allowed a part in the\r\nnative pastimes and athletics, yet on the whole they felt out of place\r\nin an atmosphere not adapted to them, and were coming to look upon the\r\nupper world as a sort of lost Elysium.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: That this noise was somehow connected with the\r\nquickening wind was apparent from the first; and the relationship\r\nbecame evident when the path swerved abruptly away from the wall and I\r\nglanced back, to behold a series of queer-looking machines supported on\r\nstone pedestals high up against the glass. It would be impossible to\r\nsay just what the machines were like ... so swiftly were they rotating\r\nthat they formed each a gray blur through which the green of the wall\r\nwas vaguely discernible.]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                 Curiosities, Freaks and Monstrosities\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though my companions felt constantly ill at ease in Atlantis,\r\nyet as the weeks went by they were becoming more proficient in the\r\nuse of the native tongue and were taking their places in the life of\r\nthe Sunken World. One by one they were being summoned, as I had been\r\nsummoned, before the Committee on Selective Assignments; and each in\r\nturn was ordered to perform some specified daily work after taking the\r\nusual thirty days’ tour around Atlantis.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gavison, as one of the most adept of all in mastering the\r\nlanguage, was one of the first to be graduated into citizenship. But\r\nhis advancement brought him no great pleasure, since his prescribed\r\nduty was to spend two and a half hours daily in a bureau engaged in\r\ncompiling statistics of population and industry; and his chosen work\r\nfor the State, which was to write a comparison of Atlantean and upper\r\nworld civilization, gave him no end of trouble owing not only to\r\nlinguistic difficulties but to his lack of training in authorship.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Stranahan and Rawson had also matriculated into citizenship;\r\nbut their assigned work differed strikingly from the Captain’s. Rawson,\r\nas a well formed and brawny youth, was permitted to exercise his\r\nmuscles for an hour and a half daily in a marble quarry some miles to\r\nthe north of the city; while Stranahan, who had been given his choice\r\nof several occupations, decided that it would suit him best to serve\r\nthree hours daily as doorman at the Archeon City Museum.\r\n\r\nIt seemed almost as if this position had been made to order for him;\r\nfor when he stood at the museum entrance, robed in an official red,\r\nand politely directed visitors to the various aisles and departments,\r\nhe had the dignity of one born to a lofty station. His work was\r\nnot altogether easy, he assured me, for the exhibits were many and\r\nconfusing, and he had difficulty in memorizing their names and\r\npositions; yet to see him as he swayed commandingly from side to side\r\nof the great arched doorway, with chest thrown well out and hands\r\nfolded sedately behind him, one could scarcely have believed that he\r\nwas troubled by any doubts, but might have imagined him to be the owner\r\nand creator of the building.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the interest which he took in the museum seemed to be almost\r\npersonal. He summoned the whole Upper World Club to inspect it, as\r\nthough it had been his own handiwork; and he directed us from gallery\r\nto gallery and from exhibit to exhibit with the serenity of perfect\r\nknowledge. And while there was much about the institution that neither\r\nhe nor the rest of us could understand, yet we had him to thank for\r\nintroducing us to some truly extraordinary displays.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, the museum was one of the things best worth seeing in\r\nall Atlantis. Not only were the contents vivid and remarkable beyond\r\ndescription, but the building itself was a never-failing source of\r\nwonder. The sides and roof were of glass, and on the lower levels the\r\nwalls were colorless and transparent, so that passers-by could feast\r\ntheir eyes on the more conspicuous displays, just as on earth the\r\npassers-by may gaze into the shop windows. But above the first story\r\nthe glass was no longer crystal-clear, but was frosted and tinted to\r\nthe semblance of clouds driven across a pale blue sky; and over those\r\nclouds and down from the enormous rounded dome a dim rainbow seemed to\r\nreach, spreading a web that varied in hue and texture with every step\r\none took and every variation in the luster of the searchlights that\r\nshone faintly from above.\r\n\r\nTo glance at this superb building, one would never have guessed\r\nwhat queer objects it concealed. For my own part, I was simply\r\nastounded--astounded at the beauty of some exhibits, at the strangeness\r\nand ghastliness of others. The department of science and inventions (to\r\nselect merely at random) was a source of bewilderment, for it showed\r\nthe oddest contrivances I had ever beheld--machines for preventing\r\nearthquakes, machines for regulating the undersea temperature, machines\r\nfor detecting and isolating noxious bacteria, machines for transforming\r\niron into copper or tin into lead, machines for boring through the\r\nground as a submarine bores through the water.\r\n\r\nBut what particularly interested me was the historical department.\r\nI shall never forget my first visit to it; it was one of the most\r\nsurprising experiences of my life. Imagine, for example, a glass case\r\nthat contained nothing but the fragment of a brick wall, a perfectly\r\ncommonplace wall of red brick!--and imagine reading that this was\r\na substance employed for building purposes in the days before the\r\nÆsthetic Renaissance! Or, again, picture yourself in contact with half\r\na dozen gold coins, larger than silver dollars and each worth several\r\ndays’ wages, yet left unguarded where any one might seize them!--and\r\nfancy reading that these bits of metal had once been considered\r\nvaluable and had even been contended for and hoarded! Or, to take still\r\nanother illustration, conceive of one’s surprise at seeing a carefully\r\ntreasured speck of coal, and being informed that this was used for fuel\r\nin the days before intra-atomic energy; or paint for yourself the shock\r\nof coming across a case of fine jewelry, of rings, earrings, brooches,\r\nbracelets, and the like, only to find them represented as typical of\r\nprimitive taste!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut while all of the historical department proved most diverting to me,\r\nthere was one section that interested me more than all the rest. This\r\nwas known as the “Hall of Horrors.” Once having observed the title,\r\nI was eager to explore the department in detail--and I was not to be\r\ndisappointed. Somehow, there was something about the “Hall of Horrors”\r\nthat seemed familiar, even though a placard at the entrance assured\r\none that all the exhibits had been preserved from a remote antiquity.\r\nThus, the first thing that I noted was a gas masque said to date from\r\nthe third century B. S., but looking as if it might have been useful\r\nin the present World War. Beside the gas masque was a steel helmet\r\nreported to be from the fourth century B. S.; yet, had it not been for\r\nthe card identifying it, I might have suspected it of being taken from\r\nthe Germans this very year.\r\n\r\nThis suspicion, however, would not have applied to the other military\r\nimplements ranged about the room; most of them were so crude of design\r\nas to make me positively smile. Even as I write this, I can re-capture\r\nthe mood of exultation I felt at the proof of our own superiority: the\r\nrifles of the second century B. S. were so puny-looking and feeble as\r\nto appear worse than primitive, and the bayonets were fully half a foot\r\nshorter than our own; the machine guns of the first century B. S. had\r\nobviously not half the killing capacity of ours, and the cannons were\r\nnot constructed for long distance firing; while the conspicuous absence\r\nof the armored “tank,” the hand grenade and “liquid fire,” showed that\r\nthe ancient Atlanteans would have had much to learn from the sanguinary\r\nexperts of our own day.\r\n\r\nFrom the “Hall of Horrors” Stranahan conducted us into another\r\nand scarcely less interesting department that was apparently\r\nnameless, since its miscellany of ancient oddities would have defied\r\nclassification. “Here’s where you’ll feel at home,” grunted our guide,\r\nas with a gesture of welcome he preceded us through the doorway. But\r\nhis remark had been poorly chosen. We did not feel in the least at\r\nhome. In fact, I had never had a more distinct reminder of my exile\r\nthan when I gazed at great brick and iron chimneys towering within\r\nglass cases, and catalogued as typical of “The Age of Steel and Fire”;\r\nand it made me almost homesick to see pictures of long-vanished cities\r\nwrapped in great clouds of smoke and soot, and described succinctly\r\nas “Representative of the Tubercular Era in Old Atlantis.” But much\r\nmore surprising to me were the huge ancient furnaces, resurrected in\r\ndetail, with puppet stokers in the act of pitching the coal into the\r\ngiant flames. An explanatory card naïvely declared that “These were\r\nonce considered necessary evils, not only for industrial reasons,\r\nbut because the Submergence had not yet made possible the automatic\r\nregulation of the weather.”\r\n\r\nBut an apparently insignificant object in the same department aroused\r\nfar greater interest among my companions. Carefully guarded under a\r\nglass cover, where it had evidently undergone some special process of\r\npreservation, was a flat, little rectangle of some shrivelled brownish\r\nsubstance, which upon close scrutiny I took to be tobacco!\r\n\r\nThat my guess had been correct was demonstrated by a placard that\r\naccompanied the exhibit: “This is a fragment of a narcotic imported\r\ninto old Atlantis from across the western ocean. It found high favor at\r\none time among the women of the country, and to a lesser extent among\r\nthe men, although its use was considered a mark of effeminacy. There\r\nwere several common ways of absorbing this drug, the most popular being\r\nto ignite it and suck the smoke into the lungs by means of a little\r\ntwisted tube. Happily, this disgusting habit has long ago disappeared,\r\nand the elimination of this plant at the time of the Good Destruction\r\nis not the least of the benefits conferred by Agripides.”\r\n\r\nI am afraid that few of my companions agreed with the latter statement.\r\nThey cast longing glances in the direction of the tobacco; and, had it\r\nnot been safely guarded beneath glass, its career would surely have\r\nended then and there.\r\n\r\nWith the memory of the tobacco still rankling in our minds, we were\r\nescorted into what was known as the “Department of Human Evolution.”\r\nHere was depicted the rise of man from the lowest savage state to\r\nthe height of present-day Atlantis. A series of skeletons indicated\r\nthe gradual transformation from a broad-boned, ape-like thing to a\r\nbig-skulled modern--and, to my great surprise, the large cranial\r\ncapacity was represented as belonging almost exclusively to the\r\naboriginal and Post-Submergence eras!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile I was wondering why this should be, I chanced to overhear\r\nthe words of a sagacious-looking bearded man, who accompanied a\r\nparty of smooth-faced youths, evidently as their tutor. “Before the\r\nSubmergence,” he was saying, “we were civilized in a rude sort of way,\r\nand yet were not intelligent. That is to say, we were not intelligent\r\nas a people, for only one man in a hundred possessed any understanding\r\nof civilization; and it was that one in a hundred, or perhaps one\r\nin a thousand, who accomplished all the changes in science, art and\r\nculture. Today, however, every normal man is intelligent enough to be\r\nmore than the dead lumber of civilization. You will observe this skull\r\nhere”--the speaker paused, and pointed to one of the most ancient of\r\nthe group--“this is the fossil of a paleolithic pre-Atlantean, who\r\ninhabited our island forty-five or fifty thousands years ago. You can\r\nsee for yourselves how much higher and ampler the skull is than that\r\nof your own ancestor of thirty-two hundred years ago, although of\r\ncourse the latter represented the world’s most advanced civilization.\r\nFortunately, our intellectual decline was counteracted by the vigorous\r\nmeasures of Agripides and his successors, and we can now boast of\r\nbeing on the same high mental plane as the men of fifty thousand years\r\nago....”\r\n\r\nThe speaker withdrew with his students toward a further exhibit, and I\r\ncould catch no more of what he said. But I had heard quite enough, for\r\nit seemed to me that his words were not to be taken seriously. And I\r\nwas more interested in browsing about the gallery than in listening to\r\nhis pointless remarks--particularly since I had chanced to set eyes on\r\nsome arresting tables of statistics. These figures, which dated back\r\nmore than three thousand years, showed how the rise in the appreciation\r\nof beauty had been almost simultaneous with the growth of intellect;\r\nhow the mental advance and the decline of crime seemed likewise to be\r\nrelated phenomena; how the general measure of happiness, as indicated\r\nby the absence of nervous disorders, mental aberrations and suicides,\r\nhad been incalculably increased since the intellectual revival.\r\n\r\nHaving read to the end of the statistics, I passed with my companions\r\ndown several long corridors to the art departments, where some of\r\nthe more notable contemporary paintings and statues were placed on\r\nexhibition along with a multitude of classic works. But if I were\r\nto dwell upon the contents of these galleries, beyond saying that\r\nits art was in that same exquisite and original style I had already\r\nobserved, I should have to add chapters to my story; and, likewise, I\r\nshould find my narrative interminable if I were to describe the other\r\nexhibits: the natural history department, with specimens of the flora\r\nand fauna of old Atlantis, the paleo-botanical department with lifelike\r\nrestorations of long-extinct tree-ferns and gigantic palms, the\r\nsociological-historical departments, with representations of scenes in\r\nprisons, poorhouses, orphanages, and insane asylums, all of which were\r\ndeclared to have been “herding places of the days when unfortunates\r\nwere so plentiful that they had to be dealt with by the pack, instead\r\nof, as at present, being consigned individually to the care of those\r\nsympathetic men and women who make social work their service for the\r\nState.”\r\n\r\nBut while the sheer abundance of the exhibits makes it impossible\r\nto describe them all, there is one that I must not fail to mention,\r\nsince in some ways it was the most remarkable in the museum. We had\r\njust entered the section ambiguously known as “Curiosities, Freaks\r\nand Monstrosities,” when Stranahan, with an odd twinkling expression,\r\nwarned us to be ready for a surprise. And, certainly, he warned us\r\nwith good reason! As we glanced toward the further wall, we were\r\nshocked by sight of something dazzlingly familiar--so very familiar,\r\nindeed, that several of us uttered little cries of amazement. Neatly\r\narranged behind a glass case, flattened against the rear panels so\r\nas to afford a better view, were dozens of well known blue uniforms!\r\nAmong them, from the Ensign’s stripes, I recognized my own; and among\r\nthem, also, was the decorated uniform of the Captain! And above\r\nthem, on a large-lettered placard, appeared the statement that these\r\nwere the clothes worn by the only aliens to enter Atlantis since the\r\nSubmergence, and that they were interesting as showing what grotesque\r\nand unsightly garments were fashionable in the upper world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                       The Warning of the Waters\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough at times during my first months in Atlantis I may have felt\r\nout of place and wished that the waters would open above me and bear me\r\nback to my own land, yet my longings were never mixed with misgivings\r\nand my regrets never tinged with fears. Even in my most pessimistic\r\nmoments, I had no doubt but that the Sunken World was secure; that no\r\nmenace to life or tranquility lurked in its well-ordered depths; that\r\nI might live out my days unmolested and in a peaceful routine. Hence I\r\nwas all the more shocked at discovery of that peril which was to give\r\nAtlantis the aspect of a beleaguered city, and to overcast its beauty\r\nwith foreboding and horror.\r\n\r\nI had been in Atlantis over a year when the crisis occurred. It was a\r\ncrisis as startling and unexpected as the flaming of a meteor out of a\r\ncalm sky; and yet, had we but known it, it had been preparing its way\r\ninsidiously during the days of fancied safety, like some mortal disease\r\nthat burrows through tissues which are apparently sound. And, like such\r\na disease, it might have been checked had it only been discovered in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI remember that one night, after many onerous hours devoted to my\r\n“History of the Upper World,” I slept but poorly, with an intermittent\r\nslumber disturbed by nightmares of huge towers crashing to destruction.\r\nAnd during the wakeful intervals my thoughts framed other nightmares,\r\nand I was agitated by a vague alarm and excitement, though I could\r\nnot understand why. Not until much later did it occur to me that some\r\ntelegraphic force, akin to the magnetic will power of the Atlanteans,\r\nmay have conveyed to me the deep unrest that surcharged the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut whether or not this explanation be valid, I know that in the\r\nmorning, when I had dressed and stood in my roof-bedroom gazing down\r\ninto the streets, I became acutely conscious that something was wrong.\r\nEvery few minutes a native or group of natives could be seen rushing by\r\nat a speed I had never before observed among the unhurried Atlanteans;\r\nand it seemed to me that their faces were convulsed as though with\r\npain or fear; while the voices occasionally borne up to me had the\r\nnervousness, almost the hysteria, of men in a panic.\r\n\r\nWhat could have happened? I wondered. Had the Atlanteans all suddenly\r\ngone mad? Or were they facing an insurrection or a civil war? Or had\r\nthe government perhaps been overthrown by a band of insurgents? Or had\r\nthere been an earthquake through which I had somehow slept? Or was\r\nthere an invasion from the upper world, and had some of our countrymen,\r\nseeking for clues of the lost X-111, discovered the Sunken World and\r\nentered?\r\n\r\nAll these possibilities, as I turned them over in my mind, seemed\r\nso fantastic that I had to discard them. Yet it still filled me\r\nwith apprehension to observe the natives scurrying about the\r\nstreets--apprehension that was to be speedily justified.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was just preparing to go out and investigate when there came an\r\nexcited rapping at my door. Unable to imagine who might be seeking me\r\nat this early hour, I cried out sharply, “Come in!”; and the door swung\r\nabruptly open to admit--Captain Gavison!\r\n\r\nHe was far from his composed and normal self. His pale blue costume was\r\nall ruffled, and had been flung over his shoulders as though in great\r\nhaste; his long hair hung dishevelled over his narrow bronzed brow; his\r\nface looked all hot and sweaty; his gray eyes burned and sparkled with\r\na vague distress.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for a formal greeting. “Have you--have you heard the\r\nnews?” he gasped, as he strode into the room.\r\n\r\nI confessed that I had heard nothing.\r\n\r\n“Don’t see how you could help hearing!” he snapped, and began to pace\r\nslowly about the floor, with brow wrinkled in bitter thought.\r\n\r\n“What news is it?” I demanded. “Just what have you heard?”\r\n\r\n“One of the natives told me strange things last night,” he confided,\r\nas he continued his restless perambulations about the room. “I haven’t\r\nslept a wink, not a wink!”\r\n\r\n“What strange things? We’re not going to be sent back home, are we?” I\r\ninquired, with an abortive effort to be facetious.\r\n\r\n“We’ll be sent to a worse place than that!” he growled, bristling\r\nalmost into his old military manner. “The glass wall has been cracked!”\r\n\r\n“The glass wall cracked?” I cried, stupidly, stunned by the terror of\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the glass wall has been cracked,” the Captain affirmed, in a\r\nmore matter-of-fact manner. “One of the patrol boats discovered the\r\ndamage late yesterday afternoon. There’s a dangerous fracture near the\r\nentrance of the Salty River.”\r\n\r\nFor reply I could only groan. The glass wall of Atlantis cracked!--the\r\nwhole Atlantic Ocean bearing down upon the Sunken World! Too well I\r\nunderstand what that meant, too well to require comment! And in that\r\nfirst moment of horrible realization I had visions of torrents pouring\r\nthrough a gap in the wall, flooding over the streets and temples and\r\nhighest towers of the land!\r\n\r\n“But how--how under heaven did it happen?” I burst forth, when I had\r\nhalf recovered from the first staggering blow.\r\n\r\n“That is not hard to say,” he declared, slowly and in measured tones.\r\n“At least, there are suspicions--”\r\n\r\n“Suspicions?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“Suspicions that you and I and the rest of us are to blame.”\r\n\r\n“But how is that possible?” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“It’s possible, all right. It all happened before we got here. The\r\nX-111, caught in the whirlpool outside the Salty River, was hurled by\r\nthe force of the waters against the glass wall, probably striking with\r\nits steel prow, which, as you know, was built for ramming our foes. The\r\nwall, luckily, was too stout to be shattered; but it was cracked, and\r\nthe crack must have been growing all this time without being noticed.”\r\n“Merciful gods!” I cried. “Then if--if anything happens to Atlantis, it\r\nwill be all on account of us!”\r\n\r\nBut before Gavison had had time to reply, there came another rapping\r\nat the door. And, hardly waiting for my summons, a wild-eyed Xanocles\r\nburst in. Like my other visitor, he did not waste time on greetings.\r\n“You--do you know?” he faltered, with a lack of self-command most\r\nunusual in him.\r\n\r\nSolemnly we assured him that we knew.\r\n\r\nWithout further delay we plunged into the subject that had brought him\r\nto us. “Maybe you’d like to go and see for yourselves?” he suggested.\r\n\r\n“But how can we see for ourselves?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The government--that is to say, the High Chief Adviser--has ordered\r\nthe intra-atomic river boats put at the people’s disposal. Seven of\r\nthem are now plying back and forth, bearing thousands to the glass\r\nwall. The Adviser thinks the people should see for themselves just what\r\nhas happened.”\r\n\r\n“Very well then, let’s go,” decided the Captain.\r\n\r\nWithout another word the three of us set out together. In silence we\r\nstrode down the long avenue that meandered toward the river. And as\r\nwe sped along we encountered dozens of the natives, all of them in as\r\ngreat a hurry as we; and all had faces flushed and excited, or fearful\r\nand drawn, or pale as though with apprehension.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the piers, we found that hundreds of Atlanteans had\r\npreceded us, most of them so transformed that I could hardly recognize\r\nthem as citizens of the Sunken World; for they were chattering wildly,\r\nor pacing distractedly back and forth, or uttering half-hysterical\r\nexclamations; and one or two were mumbling and muttering to themselves,\r\nor moving their lips silently in what might have been prayer. But they\r\ndid not fail to notice our arrival; angry exclamations broke forth at\r\nsight of us, and several of the men and women withdrew visibly from us;\r\nand, in my surprise, I did not know whether to ascribe their hostility\r\nto the unpopularity of Xanocles or to the part that Gavison and I had\r\nplayed as unconscious agents of disaster.\r\n\r\nTo calm the excited multitude, a vigorous-looking young man ventured\r\nto raise his voice, and proclaim, “Friends, there is still no reason\r\nfor alarm. We do not yet know how serious the damage may be, but the\r\nglass wall still holds; not a drop of water has broken through....\r\nThere is reason to believe that the break will be speedily repaired,\r\nand that we will go on living as happily as ever....”\r\n\r\nThese words, I was glad to see, had a soothing effect upon the\r\ncrowd. Yet I was relieved when at last the boat hove into view, a\r\nslender affair as long as the longest river vessel, but not more than\r\ntwenty-five feet from rail to rail. I did not then give any attention\r\nto its details, though I did note how low-lying it was, with but one\r\nvisible deck, one small cabin and no smokestack or mast. But after it\r\nhad drawn up to the pier and the gangplank was flung down, I wasted no\r\ntime about boarding it with my two companions. Benches and chairs were\r\nstrewn liberally about the deck, sufficient to accommodate the entire\r\ncrowd; and we had hardly taken seats when the boat commenced to shiver\r\nand throb, and we started upstream with the velocity of an express\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nSo rapidly did we move that in less than an hour we were approaching\r\nthe head of the Salty River. And during the interval I only once\r\nventured to break the moody solitude of my own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“When did you find out about all this?” I asked Xanocles, who like the\r\nrest of us seemed to be absorbed in bitter reveries.\r\n\r\n“Last night,” he returned, in an abstracted manner. “I chanced to\r\nbe in the Hall of Public Enlightenment, and heard the news over the\r\nAutophone.”\r\n\r\n“The Autophone?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“Well, naturally, you wouldn’t know what that is,” explained Xanocles.\r\n“We get our ordinary news by wireless telegraph, of course, and it is\r\nthen reported by speakers at the various public meeting places. But the\r\nAutophone is more effective, and is used only on rare and important\r\noccasions. It operates instantaneously, and consists of a tube and\r\nelectrical attachment, enabling one to hear a speaker miles away.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said I, for, after all, the Autophone did not impress\r\nme as unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nAnd with that we lapsed again into silence, a silence shared by all\r\nthe hundreds of passengers. For now that they had actually embarked\r\nupon the voyage, their excitement seemed to have died down to a mood\r\nof solemn waiting, a tense and painful waiting all too apparent in\r\nthe rigid, staring faces of the men and the women’s pale cheeks and\r\nfrightened eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was with relief that at length I saw the river growing white and\r\nagitated ahead of us, and knew that we were not far from the valve\r\nwhere the torrents were hurled in from the sea. Yet I was filled with\r\nimpatience before we swerved finally into a little side canal and our\r\nboat came to a landing before a long granite dock whence a sister\r\nship was just leaving. I need hardly state that I lost no time in\r\nstepping across the gangplank, as soon as the crowded state of the deck\r\npermitted; and though we were still three or four miles from the glass\r\nwall, I was thankful to be able to walk the distance.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo watch my two companions and myself set out along the clay footpath\r\ntoward the wall, one might have thought that we were athletes training\r\nfor a race. But if we moved rapidly, we were in no way exceptional, for\r\nthere were scores who easily kept pace with us.\r\n\r\nFor many minutes we hastened parallel to the Salty River. We passed\r\nthe long, white rapids; we passed the spot where the gigantic jet of\r\nwater shot thundering out of the pipe-like valve; we saw the wall\r\nitself sloping down before us, and near the wall we could make out a\r\nlong, black mass which ultimately resolved itself into a multitude of\r\nhumans.\r\n\r\nThis multitude, as we drew near, showed itself to be in a wildly\r\nagitated condition. Men and women were pacing frantically to and fro,\r\nswarming and squirming like worms or ants; some were gesticulating\r\nvehemently, some speaking in high-pitched tones audible from afar, some\r\nmerely standing petrified like men dealt a blow too great to bear.\r\n\r\nYet, as we took our places among them, we could observe nothing that\r\ngave cause for alarm. To our right loomed the elongated, steely gray\r\nvalve, a great tube as high as a three-story building, which narrowed\r\nas it approached the wall, and passed through it on a level with the\r\nground. And just before us sloped the wall itself, now roped off so\r\nthat we could not come within a stone’s throw, but apparently still\r\nthe same smooth, dark greenish barrier I had viewed months before.\r\nNo sign of any break or crack was visible, and it was almost with\r\ndisappointment that I noticed how flawless it seemed.\r\n\r\nBut while I stood there watching I heard a faint swishing sound, like\r\nthe lapping of sea-waves against the rocks. I may have been mistaken,\r\nfor amid the chattering and shouting of the mob and the distant roaring\r\nof waters from the valve, it was difficult to be sure just what one\r\nheard. But Gavison and Xanocles seemed to note that same ominous noise,\r\nand both paused to listen, while the anxious expression on their faces\r\ndid not relieve my misgivings. “It’s the water working through the\r\ninner layers of the glass,” I thought I heard Xanocles remark; but here\r\nagain I could not be sure, for even as he spoke a tumult of shouts\r\nburst forth, and I turned in sudden fright to see what was the matter.\r\n\r\nThis time I did not have long to wait. On one of the great\r\nroof-supporting stone columns a searchlight had been mounted; and\r\nI observed that it was slowly swinging round, casting a piercing\r\nillumination upon the wall from a bright, yellow eye glaring like the\r\nheadlight of a locomotive. For a moment it shook and wavered as if it\r\ncould not find a focus; then it became rigid and still, and a circle of\r\nthe wall, many yards across, stood out in brilliant relief.\r\n\r\nInstantly the people began to press forward. So excited were they that\r\nfor a moment I almost lost touch with Gavison and Xanocles, and could\r\ncatch no glimpse of the illuminated patch of wall. And at the same time\r\nshrill cries of terror and dismay broke forth. A man just to my rear\r\ngroaned as if in pain; a woman gave a half suppressed sob; somewhere\r\nfrom the rear came a hysterical wailing. Then, when the circle in the\r\nwall again became visible, I was wedged in so tightly that I scarcely\r\ngave it any attention. It was only by degrees that I made out its\r\nfeatures, and saw what resembled an enormous piece of cracked crockery.\r\nFrom an amorphous central blur several feet across, great seams and\r\nfissures ran in a hundred directions, with long, spidery arms that\r\nreached out like the roots of a tree, gradually growing thinner till\r\nthey vanished in vacancy. It seemed a miracle that the water had not\r\nalready burst through, for each of the scores of diverging cracks were\r\nrods long and must have been many feet deep.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI do not know how long I stood staring blankly at that tragic break\r\nin the glass. I was as one divested of power of thought or movement;\r\nI merely hovered there transfixed, listening to the muttering and\r\nsighing of the multitude. Strangely enough, it did not occur to me to\r\nask whether the damage could be repaired; it was as though I had known\r\nall the while that it was beyond remedy ... and for the moment my\r\nattitude was strangely detached, almost impersonal, as though I were\r\nthe external witness of melancholy and inexorable things....\r\n\r\nYet it was a highly personal thought that startled me back to myself.\r\nSomehow, out, of some dim subconscious depth, there swept across my\r\nmind the vision of two bright, blue eyes--and, with that vision, acute\r\nfear seized me, and longing, and despair. That Atlantis should be in\r\ndanger was fearful enough--but that Aelios should be imperiled was a\r\nthought almost too terrible for belief. And, accompanying that first\r\nwild stab of alarm for her, there came a sharp desire to see her, to\r\nbe with her, to speak with her now; and, hopeful that she might be\r\nsomewhere in this crowd, I began to search all about me, and then to\r\nthread my way at random through the dense ranks of people, scanning all\r\nthe faces in my anxiety, until Gavison and Xanocles, following me with\r\ndifficulty, began to ask irrelevantly whether the cracks were in the\r\nwall or in my head.\r\n\r\nBut no Aelios was to be seen; and at last I was forced reluctantly to\r\nabandon the quest. A dull and settled sadness had fallen over me; and,\r\ndepressed for no reason that I would have acknowledged, I expressed my\r\npurpose of returning at once to Archeon, saying that I had already seen\r\neverything there was to be seen.\r\n\r\n“But you haven’t seen a thing yet,” demurred Xanocles, who seemed\r\ndetermined that I should remain. “The submersible repair ships have not\r\nyet arrived--and when they come, they should be a sight worth watching.”\r\n\r\nAnd he slipped his arm about mine, and drew me with him toward the\r\nwall, while I still protested that it would be better for me to return\r\nto Archeon.\r\n\r\nNo doubt in the end I should have had my way, had not another hubbub\r\narisen to distract my attention. Once more the thousands of voices,\r\nwere lifted in excitement; but this time a note of joy was manifest,\r\nand even seemed to predominate. At the same time, many hands pointed\r\neagerly toward the illuminated circle in the glass; and from just\r\nbehind me I heard a thankful murmur that sounded encouragingly like\r\n“The repair ships; They’re here! They’re here!”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the repair ships had arrived. Even through the darkest sections\r\nof the wall, half a dozen faintly phosphorescent cigar-shaped forms\r\nwere dimly apparent. They were all rather small, scarcely more than\r\na third of the size of the X-111; but they seemed to be exceedingly\r\nagile, and were darting lithely back and forth like great fishes, or\r\nelse were whirling or pirouetting or standing almost on end, as though\r\nstricken with giddiness and unable to control their movements.\r\n\r\n“They’re having the devil’s own time!” muttered Xanocles, as he stood\r\nwatching. “That’s the worst danger-spot in all the ocean, for the\r\nwaters are constantly in a whirlpool because of the torrents emptied\r\ninto the Salty River. But our men are brave, and somehow they’ll manage\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“But how can they set about it?” I inquired, unable to imagine any way\r\nof making repairs.\r\n\r\n“It’s far from easy, but it can be done,” continued Xanocles. “One of\r\nthe ships will have to press itself against the wall, so closely that\r\nthere is no space between. Once all water has been excluded between\r\nthe vessel and the wall, you understand, the pressure on the ocean\r\nside will keep the ship in place. And after the ship is in the proper\r\nposition, a porthole will be opened, and through this the men will pour\r\ncement into the crack.”\r\n\r\nEven as Xanocles explained, an anchor was dropped from one of the ships\r\ninto the rocky sea bottom; and the vessel, having steadied itself,\r\nbegan to drift slowly toward the wall, so that at length its side was\r\npressed tightly against the cracked glass. Then a little circle of\r\nlight seemed suddenly to open on the ship’s side; and in that circle I\r\ncould make out the rigid, determined faces of half a dozen men, while\r\nin their hands I could observe a variety of strange rods, tubes, and\r\nlantern-like contrivances.\r\n\r\nPessimistic as I had been before, I could not but feel a burst of hope\r\nwhen I watched the capable, courageous way in which these men set to\r\nwork. And evidently the waiting throng had become hopeful too, for\r\nmurmurs of admiration and approval were repeatedly on their lips; and\r\nas they saw tube after tube of cement poured skilfully into the cracks,\r\nthey became almost mad with relief; and some began to clap their hands\r\nand caper childishly, and some sighed in thanksgiving, and some wept\r\nsilently, for, after all, Atlantis seemed to have been saved!\r\n\r\nThen, with the suddenness of a thunderbolt, all their hopes were dashed\r\nout. So swiftly did disaster descend that none had a chance to say how\r\nor whence it came--but it was disaster complete and irretrievable.\r\nPerhaps it was that the anchor-chain holding the submarine had snapped,\r\nor that some water had seeped in between the side of the vessel and\r\nthe glass wall. At all events, the submarine was plainly visible one\r\nmoment, the men pumping the viscid cement through long tubes to the\r\nvery extremities of the crack; and the next moment there was only a dim\r\nshadow flitting away into a watery obscurity.\r\n\r\nFor an instant there was an awed silence. Then, as comprehension dawned\r\nupon the crowd, a convulsive shudder swept it through and through, and\r\na howl of horror and dismay rang forth. Men glanced askance at their\r\nneighbors, blank terror gaping from their eyes; and all at once, as\r\nby a common impulse, hundreds pressed confusedly toward the wall, as\r\nthough they might succor thus those unfortunates lost in the briny\r\nwastes. But many, conscious of the futility of all action, sadly\r\nremained in their places, and mutely bowed their heads--a tribute of\r\nrespect for the drowned.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It was only by degrees that I made out its features,\r\nand saw what resembled an enormous piece of cracked crockery.

Indeed, they were among the most\r\nharrying that any resident of Atlantis had ever spent. That the peril\r\nwas acute became more and more apparent as the days went by and the\r\ndamage was not repaired--the submarine disaster which I had witnessed\r\nwas but the precursor to other and not less frightful disasters. Vessel\r\nafter vessel battled with the swirling waters in the effort to force\r\nitself against the wall and cement the crack; and vessel after vessel\r\nwas shaken away like a twig by the fury of the maelstrom. Sometimes,\r\nfortunately, the portholes were shut in time and the crew managed to\r\nsave their lives; but on other occasions the maddened waters snatched\r\ntheir prey; and before a week had gone by Atlantis was mourning for\r\nseven lost parties of rescuers.\r\n\r\nAll the country was now in a tumult, I might almost say in a delirium.\r\nThe regular currents of life had stopped short; men no longer went\r\nabout their daily duties; the libraries and art galleries were\r\ndeserted; the young were without tutors, the governmental departments\r\nwithout clerks; and the cities would have been without bread, had it\r\nnot been for the drastic orders of the High Chief Adviser. But citizens\r\nwho once had been amply occupied would loiter aimlessly about the\r\nstreets, or would flock to the Hall of Public Enlightenment to hear the\r\nlatest report over the Autophone; or else they would pace nervously\r\nalong the colonnades, or stand discussing in small groups, nerve-racked\r\nand bewildered as men under sentence of death. Though I never heard\r\nthem mention the fear that must have been uppermost in their minds, yet\r\ntheir pale faces and shuddery manner gave proof of the dread that was\r\npreying upon them; and my former shipmates and I had reason to know\r\nhow overmastering was their terror, for that aversion I had already\r\nnoted was deepening, and the people would glance at us with hostility\r\nand even accusation in their eyes, looking mute reproach at us, as\r\nthough our coming had been responsible (as indeed it had been) for the\r\nthreatened end of their world.\r\n\r\nEvery morning five or six of the little intra-atomic submarines would\r\nleave Atlantis through the valve in the eastern wall, where the waters\r\nof the Salty River were forced back into the sea. And in the evening\r\n(if they survived till evening) they would return through the valve in\r\nthe western wall, where the waters of the Salty River found entrance.\r\nIn the interval, their occupants would work as courageously as I had\r\never known men to work, warring against odds that were apparently\r\ninsurmountable; while all Atlantis would stand watching, or waiting\r\nat the Autophone for news of their progress. It seemed wrongful to my\r\ncomrades and me that these men, brave and willing as they were, should\r\nrisk their lives to repair an injury which we had caused; and so at\r\nCaptain Gavison’s suggestion several of us volunteered to join the\r\nrescuing forces. But the High Chief Adviser, although expressing his\r\ngratitude, refused our offer in terms that could admit of no reply; for\r\nthe repairing crews, as he explained, consisted of skilled mechanics\r\nespecially trained for their duties and therefore irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nFortunately, our assistance was not necessary. On the eighth day, the\r\nofficials in charge of the repairs decided upon a change of tactics;\r\nand then it was that the “Acrola,” a specially equipped submarine\r\nprovided with five anchors and an extra battery in intra-atomic\r\nengines, made its way out of the Salty River and around the glass\r\ndome to the scene of the damage. Truly, it was time that something\r\ndesperate was done, for, according to official measurements, the crack\r\nhad expanded between nine and ten inches since its detection. Thanks\r\nto its unusual powers of resistance, however, the “Acrola” withstood\r\nthe buffeting of the waters and remained pressed against the wall while\r\nCaptain Thermandos and his crew pumped the cement into the innumerable\r\nfissures. Except for the extraordinary courage of the men, it is\r\nprobable that they too would have failed, for the task occupied them\r\nfor more than six hours, any moment of which might have been their\r\nlast; and they not only had to fill the cracks, but had to hold to\r\ntheir post till the cement had begun to harden and was no longer in\r\ndanger of being washed away.\r\n\r\nBut the notable fact is that they succeeded. Though they were worn and\r\nhaggard from their exertions, yet they had succeeded magnificently.\r\nThey had saved Atlantis! After all, the flood-gates would not\r\nburst!--the devouring waters would never race along the streets and\r\ncolonnades! The people might return calmly to their work, certain that\r\ntomorrow would bring no new menace.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, at least, was the general impression. And so great was the public\r\nrelief that the pendulum swung violently from a crisis of despair to an\r\nextreme joy. Like men newly awakened from a nightmare, the Atlanteans\r\nrefused to believe that the peril had not been utterly wiped away; and\r\nso great was the force of the reaction, so sudden the snapping of the\r\ntension, that for a while their emotions controlled their heads, and\r\ntheir desire to feel safe became converted into a conviction that they\r\nwere safe. Later, many of them were to awaken from their self-hypnosis;\r\nbut during the celebration that followed the repairs, the people almost\r\nwithout exception, acted as if convinced of their rescue; and all the\r\nspeakers at the great public gatherings referred in positive terms to\r\nthe deliverance of Atlantis; and the songs that were sung were songs\r\nof thanksgiving, as of triumphant escape from a foe; and the games and\r\ndances and festive processions were those of a people wild with joy of\r\nnew-won salvation.\r\n\r\nYet even at the time there was at least one dissenting voice. Like\r\nmost dissenting voices at a moment of popular emotion, it was but\r\nlittle heard, and then was heard contemptuously; yet it was often to be\r\nremembered in later days, when the occasion called for little beyond\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nAmong the seven governmental experts sent to investigate the repairs\r\nand report on their soundness, there was one who strenuously challenged\r\nthe views of his colleagues. While the other six agreed that the damage\r\nhad been remedied beyond possibility of a further disturbance, the\r\nseventh (Peliades by name) brought in a vigorous minority report in\r\nwhich he contended that the relief was only temporary.\r\n\r\nHis plea, as I remember it, ran somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n“For four or five years--possibly for ten--the repairs will prove\r\nadequate; but after that period the damage will re-appear in a much\r\nmore aggravated form than before. For the cement constitutes a foreign\r\nelement in the glass, and produces an abnormal bulge, so placing an\r\nexceptional strain upon those portions which are still sound. For a\r\nwhile the wall may be able to endure the strain, but in the course\r\nof time the additional tension will become too great for the brittle\r\nmaterial of the wall to resist; and first small cracks will appear, and\r\nthen larger, growing by inches and by fractions of inches, until the\r\nbreak spreads towards the surface, and the tremendous pressure of the\r\nocean shatters the remaining barrier. This effect, of course, will take\r\nyears before it begins to be noticeable; but when finally it becomes\r\napparent, the crack will have spread so far that only heroic measures\r\nwill be able to save Atlantis.\r\n\r\n“The remedy, therefore, is to undertake the immediate erection of a\r\nnew glass bulwark against the affected portion of the wall. Prodigious\r\nthough this effort will necessarily be, we will probably be able to\r\ncomplete the work in time. But unless we do complete it, we will find\r\nourselves within a hair’s breadth of catastrophe.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately--most unfortunately, in view of what ensued--Peliades’\r\nwarning was scarcely heeded. In some quarters he was denounced as a\r\ncrank, a mad alarmist; in other quarters he was openly laughed at,\r\nor derided as the victim of hysteria; while the majority paid no\r\nattention to him at all. Least sympathetic of his hearers were his\r\nfellow specialists; for these, in response to an inquiry by the High\r\nChief Adviser, testified at length as to the scientific unsoundness of\r\nPeliades’ theories, and disproved his views to their own satisfaction\r\nand that of the people.\r\n\r\nAnd so the dissenter’s motions were quietly tabled, and Atlantis\r\nreturned to its normal duties with confidence in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                         The Party of Emergence\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough all Atlantis resumed its normal aspect soon after the wall\r\nhad been repaired, things were never again to be quite as before.\r\nIt was as though there were some unseen fissure in the life of the\r\nSunken World as well as in its glass boundary; as though the people\r\nrealized, subconsciously, that they hovered on the rim of a smoldering\r\nvolcano. Something seemed to be lacking that had been there before,\r\nperhaps because something was present that had never been there\r\nbefore; and the corrosive effects of fear, injected for the first time\r\nduring all the centuries of the Submergence, seemed to dissipate the\r\ncharmed tranquility of Atlantis and to suggest that inimical and even\r\ntreacherous forces lurked beyond the marble fountains and palaces and\r\nthe weird green-golden dome.\r\n\r\nBut the one tangible result of the discovery of the crack was the\r\nrise of the Party of Emergence. This despised minority group, whose\r\nvery name had been a phrase of contempt, now burst into a prominence\r\nas surprising to its members as to the people as a whole, and for\r\nthe first time in history, threatened to become a power in Atlantean\r\npolitics. Perhaps it was that there were thousands who, beset by\r\na secret dread, looked to the Party of Emergence as their only\r\nsalvation; perhaps it was merely that they had been shocked into a\r\nmore liberal-minded attitude, and could view the policy of Emergence\r\nwith wide-open eyes. At all events, a host of disciples flocked\r\nvoluntarily to the Emergence banners; and among these were many persons\r\nof influence and position, including Peliades, the engineer who had\r\ndeclared the wall unsound, and Chorendos, the Local Adviser of Archeon.\r\n\r\nAnd now began a heated and aggressive campaign, conducted incessantly\r\nand not without success in the Hall of Public Enlightenment of every\r\ntown and village in Atlantis--a campaign that threatened to develop\r\ninto a life-or-death struggle between the regenerated Emergence Party\r\nand the more venerable Submergence group. It happened that I myself\r\ntook an active, if minor part in that contest; and it also happened\r\nthat the entire Upper World Club was implicated, for we all realized\r\nthat the cause of Emergence offered us our only opportunity of\r\nreturning to the upper world.\r\n\r\nInnumerable were the meetings that we attended, and innumerable the\r\npleas that we made. To give a complete account of all our activities\r\nwould be impossible, even if I could recall them all; and so I will\r\nhave to confine myself to describing a particular meeting, which stands\r\nforth in my mind as typical.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, many months after the crack in the wall had been sealed,\r\nXanocles and I found ourselves preparing for a strenuous session at\r\nthe Hall of Public Enlightenment. It had been rumored that the day’s\r\nmeeting was to be unusually interesting, and Xanocles and I were\r\nsecretly determined to make it so; hence, when we arrived at the\r\nsapphire and amber theatre and found almost all the seats occupied, we\r\nfelt that we had every reason to congratulate ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe took chairs in the rear, and quietly awaited our turn. A discussion\r\nwas in progress regarding the award of honor to be made to a certain\r\nlyric poet. (I do not know quite what the issue was, for I did not\r\nlisten attentively.) But everyone understood that this was not to\r\nbe the topic of the day; and after the question had been settled, a\r\nmomentary hush came over the audience and many pairs of eyes were bent\r\ntoward us inquiringly.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Xanocles arose. At a gesture from that same\r\nbroad-browed elderly woman who had presided when Gavison and his crew\r\nhad been brought to trial long before, my friend stepped out into\r\nthe aisle and down to the central platform or stage, while all eyes\r\nfollowed him intently and a speechless lull dominated that great\r\nassemblage.\r\n\r\n“Fellow citizens,” he said, not taking time even for an instant’s pause\r\nafter reaching the foot of the stairs, “I am here today to make one of\r\nthe most momentous proposals ever presented since Agripides pleaded\r\nfor the Submergence. But it is not a proposal that has never been put\r\nforth before; it is merely one that has never been endorsed. It has\r\nbeen, indeed, at the very backbone of the Party of Emergence, and will\r\ncontinue to be argued and preached until it meets with that success\r\nwhich it merits. For it is impossible, my friends, that Atlantis should\r\nretain its age-old isolation; modern progress makes such backwardness\r\ninconceivable, as the arrival of thirty-nine men from outside has\r\ndemonstrated. I am certain that if Agripides himself were here now he\r\nwould agree that our policies must be revised.”\r\n\r\nHere Xanocles paused as if for emphasis; but the audience remained\r\nintently silent, and with increased forcefulness he continued, “The\r\nquestion of emigration, my friends, is one of the most important\r\nthat can confront any land. Never in the last three thousand years\r\nhas Atlantis had an adequate law on this subject; our prohibition\r\nof emigration has been a form of intolerance unworthy of the high\r\ntraditions of our people; and free emigration, if forbidden by the\r\narbitrary conventions of society, is justified by the mandates of\r\nnature and the normal human craving for romance and adventure.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I suggest that the fundamental law of Atlantis be modified.\r\nBut for the sake of those who fear to be too radical, I recommend that\r\nwe proceed cautiously at first; let us begin by allowing three or four\r\nof our people to visit the upper world; and let these, having made\r\ntheir investigations, return with their reports, so that then, on the\r\nbasis of definite knowledge, we may decide on the advantage of further\r\nemergence.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“No, no, no!” rang forth half a dozen voices in sharp disapproval; and,\r\nas Xanocles gracefully resigned the floor, one of the dissenters--a\r\ntall, stooped man with sallow face, fringed with a white beard--stepped\r\ndown to express his views.\r\n\r\n“Citizens of Atlantis,” he declared, in a voice surprisingly resonant\r\nand vigorous for one of his age, “I have lived long enough to follow\r\nthe debates of a hundred years, but never have I heard such folly as\r\nhas just been advised. Under the influence of Agripides, Atlantis has\r\nbeen beautiful, and it has been happy--and what more can life give us\r\nthan happiness and beauty? Would you let yourselves be stampeded by the\r\nravings of these modernists, who would trample on every sacred thing,\r\nseeking a panicky escape from some imaginary peril, or misled by a\r\nchildish lust for adventure or romance? Take an old man’s word, in all\r\nthe upper world there can be no romance like that spread beneath our\r\ngreen-glass dome, and no adventure like that of our golden-illumined\r\nways. Agripides was right, my friends, perhaps more marvelously right\r\nthan even he could have known; for Atlantis can remain Atlantis only so\r\nlong as the corrupting influence of the world is excluded; only so long\r\nas we are protected from those bickerings, greedy strivings and ruinous\r\nstupidities that must beset all men on an earth, which are things too\r\nvast to control and too diversified to understand. Need I do more than\r\nto remind you that already the first shock of contact with the upper\r\nworld has almost shattered the foundations of Atlantis, and left us all\r\nmomentarily in acute danger and fear?”\r\n\r\nAnd the old man ceased, and stalked majestically back to his seat,\r\nwhile the nods and murmurs of approval showed how favorably he had\r\nbeen received. Evidently the Submergence Party had scored, and scored\r\nheavily; and therefore the time seemed ripe for the address which I had\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nI had no difficulty in gaining the floor; and after a few remarks\r\nexpressing my sympathy with the ends if not with the methods of the\r\nSubmergence Party, I launched into the main body of my speech.\r\n\r\n“You are all building without ample knowledge,” said I. “And that must\r\nnecessarily be so, for what can you have learned of the upper world?\r\nBut it happens that I, thanks to some years of experience, do know a\r\nlittle of the upper world; and it is because of this that I venture to\r\naddress you on behalf of the policy of Emergence.”\r\n\r\nI paused momentarily, to pave the way for my next point; and I observed\r\nthat hundreds of pairs of eyes were straining toward me, in a silence\r\nso intense that one might have heard the dropping of the proverbial pin.\r\n\r\n“I shall not dwell upon the merely physical advantages of my own\r\nworld,” I continued. “I shall not describe its wide spaces and\r\nsplendid vistas, its tree-mantled valleys and sun-burnished lakes,\r\nits uproarious white-splashed oceans and billowy mountains, dark\r\nwith forest or glittering with the snow. I shall not linger over the\r\ntingling freshness of starry winter nights, the feathery softness\r\nof the spring, the enchantment of firefly-haunted glades or of the\r\never-shifting skies, with their fragile blue or gray or burning sunset\r\nred. I shall not discourse upon these sights, for even in the upper\r\nworld they are but little noted, save by an occasional nature crank or\r\npoet.\r\n\r\n“But what I shall strive to make plain are those advantages familiar\r\nto every thinking citizen of the earth. Let me begin, for example, by\r\npicturing the life of the typical dweller in our greatest city. Not\r\nonly in his home but in his work he enjoys the benefits of the most\r\nprogressive civilization ever known. To begin with, his dwelling may be\r\nof any type that accords with his means and capacity, for if he likes\r\nhigh places and can afford them, he may enjoy the privilege of looking\r\ndown upon his neighbors from the eleventh story; or, if he prefers\r\nexercise, he may walk up to the sixth floor whenever he goes home; or,\r\nagain, if he be of a sluggish disposition, he may take lodgings at\r\nstreet level--and all without extra charge.\r\n\r\n“Now let me depict the daily routine of such a man. After being\r\naroused in the morning by a wonderful little clock that is almost human\r\nin its faithfulness to habit, he slips hastily into his clothes and\r\nconsumes a breakfast perhaps featured by refrigerated beefsteak grown\r\nhalf a world away, and by coffee mixed with the condensed milk of cows\r\nthat lived far away and long ago. Having thus fortified himself against\r\nthe day’s exigencies, he loses no time about leaving the house; and,\r\nin company with thousands as fortunate as himself, he enters a little\r\nhole in the ground, and twenty minutes or half an hour later emerges\r\nfrom another and precisely similar hole five or ten miles away. But\r\nthis is the least of his conveniences. After climbing from the second\r\nhole, he wedges his way into a little movable electric box in any of\r\nour downtown buildings, and promptly finds himself delivered opposite\r\nhis office on the fifteenth or twentieth floor. He is now ready for the\r\nday’s duties; and so marvelously simple is modern civilization that, no\r\nmatter what those duties be, they are always the same.\r\n\r\n“For there is only one task that seems worth while to the modern man,\r\nand that is the making of money. Just why money-making is so important\r\nis a question that I personally cannot answer; but it must be important\r\nindeed, for every one becomes involved in it, especially those who have\r\nmore already than they know what to do with; and this is doubtless why\r\nmodern civilization runs so smoothly, why the wheels turn so regularly\r\nin so many mills, the shafts are sunk so deeply in so many mines, the\r\nforests are cut so completely from so many mountain sides, and men\r\ncontinue to spread out and multiply despite battles, pestilences, labor\r\nwars, earthquakes, and explosions.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of my address I had rather lost control of myself,\r\nsaying things I had not intended to say, things I did not exactly mean.\r\nBut my enthusiasm carried me along irresistibly, and it was not until\r\nI was launched into mid-channel that I paused for a glimpse of my\r\naudience and observed the stares of amazement the nods of incredulity\r\nand the frowns of repulsion with which my words were received. Then\r\nsuddenly I was sorry, for now I remembered how once before I had\r\ndamaged my own cause by dwelling indiscreetly upon the merits of the\r\nupper world. But though I was following the wrong track I did not know\r\nhow to find the right one--for unless I described our industrial and\r\nmechanical progress, what was there for me to boast about? And so, face\r\nto face with an impassable barrier, I faltered midway in my address,\r\nhastily summarized, led up to a feeble peroration, and confusedly took\r\nmy seat.\r\n\r\nAs I returned to Xanocles’ side, a strained silence filled the air;\r\nand the shocked and even hostile glances of the audiences showed how\r\ngravely I had harmed the cause of Emergence.\r\n\r\nBut though I personally had failed, Xanocles was equal to the\r\nemergency. Springing to his feet during the momentary lull that\r\nfollowed my fiasco, he caught the attention of the chairwoman, and for\r\nthe second time was accorded permission to address the meeting.\r\n\r\n“Fellow citizens,” he began, while the full attention of the assembled\r\nhundreds was focused upon him, “it deeply grieves me to hear of the\r\ndeplorable state of affairs in the upper world. No doubt our friend has\r\nunconsciously exaggerated, for it is incredible that, after all these\r\nthousands of years, the unsubmerged races should still be so primitive\r\nas he has indicated. Yet we must accept his picture of conditions; we\r\nmust reluctantly admit that our fellows on earth are still groping\r\nin the semi-savagery of the Age of Smoke and Iron, from which we\r\nAtlanteans escaped three thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n“But does that mean that we should ignore the upper world? Does that\r\nmean that we, in the consciousness of our superiority, should not reach\r\nout a helping hand to our brothers? To forget them in their need would\r\nbe unworthy of the disciples of Agripides! Indeed, it is because of\r\nthe very limitations of the upper world that we must emerge!--it is\r\nbecause the people are so deeply in need of assistance! Let us show\r\nthem the folly of their ways! Let us convert them to the wisdom of\r\nAtlantis! Let us teach them that steel and gold are but frail things\r\nafter all! Let us send out our missionaries among them, and bring them\r\nthe creed of Agripides! Do you not realize, fellow citizens, that such\r\nan opportunity has never before been thrust at your door? For not only\r\nmay you deliver the upper world from its barbarities and teach it a\r\ntrue culture, but you may show its peoples how to build glass walls and\r\nsubmerge as we have submerged!”\r\n\r\nAnd in this wild vein Xanocles rambled on and on, while his hearers\r\nfollowed him with enthusiasm that seemed gradually to mount to the\r\npoint of conviction.\r\n\r\nOther arguments followed, which I will not weary the reader with\r\nrepeating; and after all who desired it, had had their say, a vote was\r\ntaken on Xanocles’ emergence proposal.\r\n\r\nTo our great joy, the motion carried--carried by the decisive ratio of\r\nalmost two to one! The moment of triumph, however, had not yet arrived;\r\nfor, before the measure could become operative, it had to be approved\r\nby a referendum of all the Atlanteans.\r\n\r\nThat referendum, according to the law, could not be held for at least\r\nthirty days, the interval being considered necessary for discussion.\r\nHence there ensued a most exciting thirty days for Xanocles and myself,\r\nas well as for all members of the parties of Emergence and Submergence.\r\nNever in the past three thousand years had so fundamental an issue\r\nbeen brought before the people; for the first time since the Good\r\nDestruction, the basic principles of Agripides were at stake!\r\n\r\nSince there were no newspapers in Atlantis, at least one agency of\r\npolitical excitement was lacking. But there were other agencies in\r\nabundance. Never--with the exception of those dreadful days following\r\nthe discovery of the crack--had I seen the Atlanteans so agitated.\r\nIn all the houses and meetings that I visited, the chief topic of\r\nconversation was the proposed “Emergence Act”; every one was anxious to\r\ndeliver his opinion, and every one----man and woman alike,----seemed to\r\nhave an opinion, which he was capable of expressing in apt and pointed\r\nterms. But the desire for discussion was particularly in evidence at\r\nthe great assemblies held daily at the Hall of Public Enlightenment;\r\nand it was there that Xanocles and his fellow “Debating Delegates”\r\nof the Emergence Party made some of the most forceful and eloquent\r\npleas I had ever heard; and their rivals of the Submergence group\r\nwere scarcely less fervid in appealing for the time-honored policies.\r\nThese activities, I need hardly point out, were not confined to one\r\ncity, but were participated in by all the eighteen cities of Atlantis;\r\nand numerous speakers from outside points would arrive to address the\r\ngatherings in Archeon, while occasionally Xanocles or some other leader\r\nwould leave to speak in neighboring towns.\r\n\r\nNot least eager among the fighters for Emergence were the thirty-nine\r\nmembers of the Upper World Club. Indeed, it is certain that none of the\r\nolder members could have outdone us in enthusiasm or determination. For\r\nwe had more than an abstract principle at stake--our entire future lay\r\nin the balance.\r\n\r\nAnd while I personally was not eager to return to earth just now (being\r\ndetained by thought of a certain fair-haired, blue-eyed woman), yet\r\nmost of my comrades were almost passionately anxious to escape, for\r\nas time went by they found themselves more and more out of place in\r\nthis too-perfect land, and increasingly unable to perform the duties\r\nrequired of them as citizens of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nBut if they were dissatisfied with the Sunken World and incapable\r\nof making any contribution to Atlantean culture, they proved very\r\ncompetent when it came to helping the cause of Emergence. Few of\r\nthem were sufficiently skilled in the language to speak in public\r\n(Captain Gavison was an exception, and several times expressed himself\r\nforcefully and to good effect); but they were all adepts at private\r\nelectioneering; and they would stop every Atlantean they could inveigle\r\ninto conversation and plead the cause of Emergence. Frequently, indeed,\r\nthey did more harm than good; and I remember that Stranahan repeated\r\nmy own error, and frightened away several prospective emergionists\r\nby boastfully describing the magnitude of wars in the upper world;\r\nand once I overheard Rawson draw an involuntary cry of disgust from a\r\nhearer, when he tactlessly decanted upon the advantages of airplanes\r\nas bomb throwers. But on the whole the men were well coached by\r\nmembers of the Emergence party, and knew enough to confine themselves\r\nto describing the beauty of the upper world! Partly because of their\r\naid, but chiefly by virtue of the vigorous campaign being conducted in\r\nall the four corners of Atlantis, we had hopes that our revolutionary\r\nmeasure was to become law.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: And the utter helplessness of their plight--and of\r\nours--became tragically apparent when suddenly a great elongated\r\ngray mass came flying in with the torrents from the sea--a rescuing\r\nsubmarine that had been hurled in through the gap in the wall!]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                            Crucial Moments\r\n\r\n\r\nAn election in Atlantis was seldom accompanied by intense excitement.\r\nThere was no registration, for all citizens were permanently enrolled\r\nwith the population bureau; on election day all the men and women of\r\nvoting age (which means all who had passed their High Initiation)\r\nappeared quietly at the designated polling places to cast a secret\r\nballot, or else--if they preferred--they sent in their vote in writing\r\ntwo or three days earlier. The election boards then slowly counted\r\nthe votes, and the fate of the measure (for laws were the only things\r\npassed on by the voters of Atlantis) was disclosed at the Hall of\r\nPublic Enlightenment.\r\n\r\nBut the Emergence proposal proved an exception to the rule. Not a\r\nlittle agitation was apparent among the men and women thronging to the\r\nelection chambers; and this agitation was heightened by the members of\r\nthe Upper World Club, who used earthly political tactics by accosting\r\nthe voters before they reached the polls and showering them with final\r\narguments and pleas. It is doubtful whether these eleventh hour efforts\r\nhad any effect, and, indeed, the results showed that they might have\r\nbeen spared; but at the time we felt that our exertions had not been in\r\nvain, and during the election and the days of suspense that followed,\r\nwe remained unwarrantedly hopeful.\r\n\r\nThen came the disillusioning blow. After three days, the election\r\nresults were announced in the Hall of Public Enlightenment. Out of\r\nmore than a third of a million votes cast in all Atlantis, our party\r\nhad polled nearly a hundred and fifty thousand--yet had failed by many\r\nthousands to equal the Submergence total.\r\n\r\nEven so, we were not wholly discouraged. As Xanocles pointed out, the\r\ncause of Emergence had never before been able to attract one-tenth as\r\nmany voters; and we had reason to hope that we would eventually bring\r\nthe majority to our side. And no sooner had the news of our defeat\r\nreached us than we began to plan for further campaigns, for we were\r\ndetermined not to abandon the fight so long as we had breath with which\r\nto wage it.\r\n\r\nYet in one respect I was already regretting my connection with\r\nthe Emergence Party. My regrets, to be sure, arose from purely\r\nnon-political motives, and could not make me alter my allegiance; but\r\nthey were none the less deep-rooted. To my surprise and chagrin, I\r\nfound that my campaigning activities were bringing me into disfavor\r\nwith Aelios. As one of Agripides’ staunch admirers and a devoted member\r\nof the Party of Submergence, she looked with growing disapproval upon\r\nmy association with Xanocles and his kind; and during those little\r\nconferences, which we had for the supposed purpose of discussing my\r\n“History of the Upper World,” she would take occasion to reprove me\r\nmildly and even to suggest that my conduct savored of disloyalty.\r\n\r\nOf course, I would plead my right as a citizen to espouse any political\r\ncause that appealed to me; but she would nod gravely with dissent.\r\n“Theoretically you may have the right,” she would remind me, “but don’t\r\nyou think you are showing remarkably bad taste? Remember, you came\r\ninto our land uninvited, and have been freely received as one of us,\r\nand given citizenship and all the privileges of a native. And how do\r\nyou show your appreciation? By taking sides with the party that would\r\nundermine our institutions; by doing all you can to wreck the very\r\ncountry that succored you.”\r\n\r\nTo this I would reply that I had no intention of wrecking the country;\r\nthat I was trying to further its interests according to my own lights.\r\nAnd Aelios, while not convinced that my own lights were the right ones,\r\nwould at least admit that my motives were sincere; and having reached\r\nthis halfway point of agreement, we would invariably turn to less\r\nprovocative subjects.\r\n\r\nBut despite her disapproval of my Emergence views, I had reason to be\r\nencouraged by her attitude toward me. I saw her, while not often, at\r\nleast often enough to be assured of her friendship; and now and then I\r\ncaught in her eyes a bright, warm light which intimated that what she\r\nfelt might be more than friendship. Yet it may merely have been that\r\nmy desires passed judgment for me, for not by a word or a gesture did\r\nshe give evidence that she regarded me otherwise than as one kindly\r\ndisposed human being may regard another; and the occasional hints of\r\nsome gentler emotion were so rare and so fleeting that I could not be\r\nsure. And so, as best I could, I restrained my impatience, at first\r\nnever seriously believing that I could aspire to her height, then\r\ngradually fanning faint hopes that remained concealed beneath the\r\nmantle of my diffidence. It was long before we even approached the\r\nsubject of love; and meanwhile, we would speak of impersonal things, or\r\npersonal things securely buried in the past, and nothing in my words\r\nwould give hint of the passion flaming to life within me, while in her\r\nwords I saw the traces only of a vivid and beauty-loving mind serenely\r\nunconscious of sex.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut even in Atlantis it was impossible that we should continue to see\r\none another and yet retain a merely placid brother-and-sister attitude.\r\nHow it was with her I do not know, but I was the son of a world whose\r\npassions burn gustily and strong; and I was becoming almost painfully\r\nobsessed with the thought of her, and would be given to long fits of\r\nmelancholy in her absence, while at times in her presence I would\r\nbe tantalized by her passionless calm, and would feel the old sweet\r\nprimitive prompting to slip my arms about her, and enfold her as one\r\nmight enfold the Ultimate. But always I would restrain myself, for how\r\nbe sure of the reaction of this daughter of an alien civilization?\r\nHow be sure that embraces and caresses would not be repulsive to the\r\nAtlanteans? And so, though possessed by the thought of her, as by some\r\nexquisite perfume that provokes and allures, I repressed my eagerness\r\nfor many, many months, awaiting that opportunity which in the end, I\r\nfelt sure, time and circumstance must provide.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end my patience was rewarded, and I was favored\r\nunexpectedly by one of those occasions which life, if left quietly to\r\nitself, seems usually to offer to lovers.\r\n\r\nIt was after one of my rare and delightful afternoons with Aelios, that\r\nthe supreme event occurred. We had been strolling together about the\r\ncity, and had gone for a moment’s rest into the “Temple of the Stars,”\r\nthat majestic edifice in which Rawson and I had been trapped so long\r\nbefore. Seated on a stone bench in the darkness, we gazed awe-stricken\r\nat the spectacle above us--the whole glittering panorama of the\r\nnight-skies, almost as I had beheld them so many times on earth. And as\r\nI peered up at the image of those heavens I could hardly hope to see\r\nagain, a sad and reminiscent mood came over me; I could fancy myself\r\nonce more on earth, and was wistful for all that earth contained;\r\nI missed the friends I had known, the sparkle of the sunshine, the\r\nmagnificence of white-throated mountains: I longed for the bluster and\r\ncannonade of tempests, the icy tingling of the snow, the splashing and\r\nfoamy turbulence of the ocean. And Aelios, although she had never known\r\nthese things and could scarcely imagine what they meant, was strangely\r\nresponsive to my mood, and seemed even to feel my melancholy. She asked\r\nme gently about the world I had left, and how it felt to wander among\r\nthe great cities of the earth, and how it felt to hear the purling\r\nof mountain brooklets or to sit on a grassy knoll with the great sun\r\nblazing in the blue above. And, remembering all that I had seen and\r\nheard before my captivity in Atlantis, I described to Aelios what my\r\nlife had been, and told of my adventures and wanderings, my happy\r\nchildhood and youth and early manhood; and I drew upon my imagination\r\nfor gorgeous pictures of the upper world, and painted the home I had\r\nlost as little less than a Paradise.\r\n\r\n“Ah, now I see why you’ve joined the Emergence Party,” Aelios remarked,\r\nher face glowing dimly in the near-starlight, and her eyes soft with a\r\nkindly luster. “Of course, you must sometimes wish yourself back among\r\nall those wonderful scenes you left.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, indeed, I am sorry,” said I, in low tones and\r\nreminiscently. “Sometimes I almost wish to be again in my native land.\r\nBut there are other times when I am glad, very glad to be here, and\r\nwhen I would not go back to my own country if I could--not if you\r\noffered me the whole world.”\r\n\r\n“And when is that?” asked Aelios. “When you are in the beautiful\r\nbuildings here, or look at the exquisite statuary?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sometimes then,” I replied. “But not only then. There are other\r\nexquisite things that make me wish to stay.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can understand,” she declared, apparently still innocent of the\r\ntrend of my remarks. “The paintings, for example, or the colonnades,\r\nor----”\r\n\r\n“No, not only that,” I interrupted. “There is something more personal,\r\nmore human--something that--” Here I hesitated, hardly able to proceed,\r\nfor I realized that I was approaching an embarrassing climax.\r\n\r\n“You mean then, that you like the people here?” she volunteered, still\r\nwith perfect candor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed I like the people!” I vowed, fervently. “And one person in\r\nparticular!”\r\n\r\nIf this remark had been intended to evoke a telltale reply, it was to\r\nfail signally. “Oh, I am glad you are so attached to your friends!” she\r\nresponded, whether innocently or with calculating cleverness I could\r\nnot say, since the darkness concealed any blush that may have suffused\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n“But don’t you understand, Aelios?” I persisted. “Don’t you know whom\r\nin particular I mean?”\r\n\r\nThe note of surprise in her answer was either genuine or else was born\r\nof remarkably skilful acting. “How should I know whom you mean? Am I\r\nwith you often enough to know all your friends?”\r\n\r\nShe was making matters difficult for me. But, having reached this\r\ntactical position, I was determined not to surrender. “Why, Aelios,”\r\nI countered, “whom should you imagine that I have for my particular\r\nfriend? Whom but yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Myself?” she repeated, in sheer astonishment. “Myself?”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was silence; but this time I felt that there could\r\nbe no doubt about the blush that mounted to her face. And at length she\r\nturned to me with softly, smoldering eyes and the assurance of victory\r\nentered my heart and then swiftly receded as she murmured, bashfully,\r\n“I am pleased, very much pleased, to know you feel that way. It is a\r\ngreat compliment to me, and I am very proud--for nothing in Atlantis is\r\nheld more precious than friendship.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but it is not only friendship!” I remonstrated, wondering if it\r\nwere possible that she still misunderstood. “It’s not only friendship,\r\nAelios! It is love!”\r\n\r\n“Love?” she echoed, in low tones of surprise; and another long silence\r\nfollowed, while I waited eagerly for the words that did not come, and\r\nshe averted her head so that not even the dimly glowing eyes were\r\nvisible. Then, when the suspense was becoming embarrassing, I found\r\nhesitating speech, which gradually grew more fluent and assured; and\r\nall the pent-up emotions of months welled forth and forced a passionate\r\ntorrent from my tongue, so vehement as to surprise even myself. I told\r\nher how immeasurably dear she had become; how she had been for me\r\nthe central light of all this strange world; how she had soothed my\r\nloneliness, dispersed my despair, and given me hope and a reason for\r\nliving; how my life could have meaning and beauty only if she had a\r\nshare in it, while without her all things would be desolate and blank.\r\nAll this and much more I poured forth in an eager rhapsody, not pausing\r\nto reflect that I was but repeating the sentiments of a million lovers;\r\nand the strength of my feelings perhaps lent wings to my commonplace\r\nwords, and gave them a power that no analysis could reveal. Or perhaps\r\nit was that Atlantean lovers never expressed themselves as do lovers on\r\nearth; for even in the darkness I was aware that Aelios was listening,\r\nlistening intently, listening almost with a breathless interest, as\r\nthough she had never heard or imagined words such as mine.\r\n\r\nAfter I had finished, she seemed still held in some spell of\r\nspeechlessness. For several tense seconds, slow-dragging portentous\r\nseconds that seemed minutes long, I waited for her to brook silence.\r\nBut when her response came, it was in passionless tones that contrasted\r\noddly with my emotion; and with an accentuation so feeble as to\r\nresemble a whisper, she declared, “All this that you say seems strange\r\nto me, very, very strange. You speak of love, but I fear I do not\r\nunderstand. Perhaps love in your land is not the same as here, for I am\r\nsure that what you speak of is not what we would call love.”\r\n\r\n“And what would you call love?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It is something that hardly needs a name. It is like none of those\r\nmomentary attachments that men and women sometimes feel. It is\r\nsomething that wraps one’s whole being in a mighty flame, and is born\r\nchiefly of a kinship of the mind and heart; and when it comes, it need\r\nnot be much spoken of, but can never be forgotten or lost.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I feel toward you, Aelios!” I assured her, fervently.\r\n\r\n“But I do not know if it is what I feel toward you,” she returned,\r\nsimply. “I do not know--I cannot yet be sure.”\r\n\r\n“But you think that perhaps--that perhaps sometime--” I gasped, wild\r\nhope springing to life within me.\r\n\r\n“Yes, perhaps sometime--I cannot say,” she murmured, slowly.\r\n\r\nBut in her tones was the assurance of that which her expressed words\r\ndenied; and, with the exultation of unlooked for success, I at last\r\nflung myself free of restraint, and my arms found their way about her\r\nslim, resisting form.\r\n\r\nBut somehow she slipped free of my clasp, and stood dimly outlined\r\nbefore me in the shadows, herself no more than a shadow in this unreal\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n“Not yet, my lover, not yet,” she forbade, in gentle tones that gave no\r\nindication of the hurt feelings I had feared.\r\n\r\n“But when, Aelios?” I demanded, baffled, but far from discouraged.\r\n“When--when may we get married?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, not yet for a while--if ever,” she decided. “We must wait,\r\nwe must wait until we are both quite certain.” She paused, then\r\nadded casually, “Besides, remember, you have a duty to perform--an\r\nall-important duty with which neither your own pleasure nor your love\r\nmust interfere.”\r\n\r\n“But what after I have performed that duty? What after my work is\r\ncompleted? Will you then--”\r\n\r\n“I will then be willing to listen to you again,” was all she would\r\nvouchsafe. “Come, let us be going now.”\r\n\r\nAnd she started for the door, while I followed awkwardly, since she\r\nknew the way much better than I. And, once outside, she began speaking\r\nimpersonally about the art of the colonnades and marble galleries, and\r\nseemed to have forgotten entirely the subject that had been absorbing\r\nus. But in her eyes was an unusual sparkle, and in her cheeks an\r\nunwonted glow; and after I had left her and she had gone tripping out\r\nof sight, I pursued my way thoughtfully homeward, my steps made buoyant\r\nby a hope I once would not have dared to entertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                    “The History of the Upper World”\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been in Atlantis two years before I had completed my “History of\r\nthe Upper World.” Considering the magnitude of the task, it surprises\r\nme now to remember that I finished it so quickly, for not only was it\r\nlonger than three average-sized volumes, but I was retarded by writing\r\nit in an adopted tongue and by having to work exclusively from memory\r\nand without reference books other than the Atlantean dictionaries. But\r\nsix or seven hours of daily application is certain to show results even\r\nthough one works slowly.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a proud day, and yet a day of many doubts, when I bore\r\nthe finished manuscript to the office of the Literary Registrar.\r\nThis official, assisted by a board of fifteen recognized writers and\r\ncritics, passed upon all literary works submitted by the authors of\r\nAtlantis; and all books found worthy of perpetuation were published\r\nunder his direction, while unstinted advice and criticism was given\r\nto promising aspirants. In the case of my own book, there could be no\r\ndoubt as to publication, for not only had I been specifically directed\r\nto write it, but all Atlantis was eagerly awaiting the information it\r\nwas expected to convey. None the less, it had to undergo the regular\r\nprocedure of inspection by the Registrar; and, as it happened, this was\r\nmore than a fruitless formality. Before the manuscript was given to\r\nthe press a trained essayist was appointed to help me reconstruct the\r\nstyle; and, thanks to his assistance, my writing attained a dignity and\r\npolish I myself could never have supplied.\r\n\r\nBut when at last the publication of the book was ordered, I had\r\ngood reason to be gratified. An edition of fifty thousand was to be\r\nissued--an edition of phenomenal size considering that the population\r\nof Atlantis was only half a million.\r\n\r\nNaturally, I sought to know the reason for this enormous printing;\r\nand I learned much as to book distribution in the Sunken World.\r\nPublication, like all other activities, was solely in the hands of the\r\ngovernment; and copies of all the hundreds of books issued each year\r\nwere sent as a matter of course to every library in the land. Moreover,\r\nevery citizen was permitted his choice of any fifty of the year’s\r\nbooks, the receipt of which was considered not a privilege but a right;\r\nand men and women engaged in research work were allowed in excess of\r\nfifty if they made plain their need of the additional volumes. In the\r\ncase of my own book, public interest was at such a pitch, that a large\r\npercentage of the people were certain to include it among their chosen\r\nfifty; and the first edition was therefore regarded as conservative in\r\nsize rather than excessive.\r\n\r\nSo, in fact, it proved. The book was hardly off the press when orders\r\nbegan to pour in so rapidly that a second edition of fifty thousand had\r\nto be prepared. For it was literally true that every one was reading\r\n“The History of the Upper World”; and when I say every one, I do not\r\nmean one man out of every hundred, as might be the case were I writing\r\non the earth; I mean that there was actually not a person of reading\r\nage who did not feel bound to acquaint himself with the contents of my\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, I found my life taking on a tinge of unwonted\r\nexcitement. The notoriety of successful authorship was mine--and the\r\nsatisfaction of one who finds himself the center of a storm of his own\r\ncreation. For it was with a start of surprise, a gasp of incredulity\r\nand a wail of horror that Atlantis read the news of the upper world.\r\nPreviously, when I had let loose a few hints as to life on earth, I\r\nhad witnessed some curious reactions; but the former bewilderment and\r\ndisgust of the people now seemed insignificant by comparison. It would\r\nbe impossible to convey any idea of their repugnance to earthly life as\r\nI portrayed it; it was almost as if they had learned that we had gone\r\nback on all fours, or had joined the orang-utan and the gibbon in the\r\ntrees; and the dozens of letters I received, the dozens of visitors\r\nthat poured in upon me, and the dozens of inquiries addressed to me at\r\npublic meetings, all gave evidence of a single but profound emotion: a\r\nsense of wonder and of revulsion at the degeneracy of the upper world.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the clearest proof of the general attitude was to be seen in\r\nthe reviews of the book--reviews which, unlike earthly criticism, were\r\nnot printed, but were delivered orally before gatherings at the Hall of\r\nPublic Enlightenment.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me quote, for example, from a typical address.\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Thermanides, a well known writer on social and\r\nphilosophic questions; and his views regarding the upper world were\r\nmilder in many ways than those of his audience. Speaking before an\r\nassemblage of four or five hundred, he showed himself to be precise and\r\nthorough in his acquaintance with my book.\r\n\r\n“Since we have no reason to believe that the author has deliberately\r\nexaggerated,” he declared, after summarizing the contents, “we must\r\naccept the picture of upper world life as he presents it. And what,\r\ntherefore, must we conclude? That Agripides was wise, wonderfully wise,\r\nwhen he urged us to submerge. There can hardly be any more distressing\r\nsubject than the history of the earth; even the most daring satirist,\r\nplaying upon his imagination to expose the stupidity of the human race,\r\ncould not offer a blacker picture of follies, crimes and inanities than\r\nAnson Harkness has painted for us in all seriousness. For what do we\r\nfind to be the outstanding historical facts as he depicts them? Has the\r\nhuman race gone continuously forward, forgetting its savage instincts\r\nin perfecting a civilization at once beautiful and secure?--has man\r\ncome to look on man otherwise than as beast looks on beast?--or has\r\nsociety come to be composed of nothing more than a clothed jungle\r\npack? No, my friends--unfortunately no, if we would believe the volume\r\nbefore us. Slave-raids and wars; rebellions and murders; conquest and\r\npersecution; treachery and rapine and wholesale exploitation; dynasties\r\nthat crumble and empires that decompose--these are the sign-posts\r\nof the past three thousand years; and evidently there has been no\r\nconcerted or intelligent effort to create other and less revolting\r\nlandmarks.\r\n\r\n“Yet though the darkness seems impenetrable, I can see one faint\r\nglimmer of hope. In the self-satisfied blindness of the upper world\r\nreposes the possible solution. It is not a solution altogether pleasing\r\nto contemplate, but it is the sort of cleansing remedy that nature\r\nwill sometimes provide when a wound has festered beyond possibility of\r\nhealing. For if no ordinary cure be attainable, life will sometimes\r\ntake the sword into her own hands, and with one blow wipe out all her\r\nold mistakes, and with one blow bring annihilation. It is that stroke\r\nwhich, it seems to me, is about to fall upon the upper world man,\r\nsmiting his rancorous and lopsided civilization, and turning against\r\nhis own throat that knife with which he thinks to gouge out the eyes of\r\nhis foe. And this is perhaps well, my friends, for after earthly man\r\nhas committed suicide, the world will be ready for a population of less\r\nshortsighted and quarrelsome creatures, be they only beetles or ants!”\r\n\r\nAnd with a thankful gesture, as of one who lectures on the impending\r\nextinction of cannibalism, the speaker returned to his seat; while,\r\nmuch to my chagrin, I noted that his words had apparently found high\r\nfavor with his audience. And those that arose in the ensuing discussion\r\nwere not less narrow-minded than the principal reviewer himself;\r\nthey seemed to imagine that my book had been intended as a sort of\r\ncatalogue of horrors instead of as a restrained and veracious history;\r\nand either they suggested that I must have exaggerated hopelessly, or\r\nelse they agreed that the upper world was so decadent that a second\r\n“Good Destruction” would be desirable. “Blood-curdling,” “Sepulchral,”\r\n“An able story of depravity and crime,” “The last word in thrills\r\nand terror”--these were some of the expressions used by the various\r\ncommentators; and, to judge from their remarks, one might have thought\r\nthat I had written a popular novel of mystery and murder instead of a\r\nsober history.\r\n\r\nBut while all Atlantis was reading the book and being provoked and\r\nshocked by my most commonplace statements, I was surprised to observe\r\none effect which I deplored even more than the gross misunderstanding\r\nof upper world standards and ideals. For the “History” had acted like a\r\nbombshell against the Party of Emergence! Deserters from our standards\r\nwere now legion, and in a few weeks we had lost all that we had gained\r\nfollowing the discovery of the crack in the wall. It was as if the\r\npeople had been frightened by my picture of the lands above seas,\r\nfrightened so that they wished to shun all contact with the earth as\r\nthey might shun things unclean and evil; and despite all that Xanocles\r\nand the other Emergence leaders could do, it was impossible to shake\r\nthe masses free of this ridiculous attitude. At a test vote of an\r\nEmergence measure two months after the appearance of the “History of\r\nthe Upper World,” we were defeated more decisively than even our foes\r\nhad predicted, defeated by the overwhelming ratio of ten to one!--And,\r\nin my disappointment and self-accusing despair, I bitterly regretted\r\nthat I had not written my book from a less realistic point of view, for\r\nI knew that nothing short of a catastrophe or a miracle could now open\r\nup the lanes back to the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                          A Happy Consummation\r\n\r\n\r\nNot many months after the publication of the “History of the Upper\r\nWorld” there occurred a vastly more important event. At least, it\r\nwas vastly more important to me, and constituted the most fortunate\r\nepisode of all my life in Atlantis. Ever since that encouraging talk\r\nwith Aelios in “The Temple of the Stars,” I had been drawing gradually\r\nnearer to her; and by slow and unconscious degrees, so subtle that\r\nwe ourselves could hardly note the change, we seemed to be entering\r\nupon the rôle of lovers. There was no emotional demonstration, and\r\nno deliberate reference to love, for in Atlantis it was considered\r\nundignified to express any casual amorous sentiments; but at times,\r\nin her eyes I would catch that reassuring look I had noted at rare\r\nintervals before, and in our increasingly frequent meetings, her\r\nmanner seemed to be tinged by something indefinably wistful and yet\r\nindefinably gentle, that I had not previously observed.\r\n\r\nIt might be imagined that the appearance and wide discussion of my book\r\nwould have had an adverse effect upon her; but, fortunately, I had\r\nshown her many chapters before publication, and the contents were no\r\nsurprise to her. And while she was at one with her people in loathing\r\nthe upper world, she could hardly blame me for the conditions I\r\ndepicted. Indeed, she was soon to give proof that she did not consider\r\nme in the least a partner in the supposed backwardness of my race.\r\n\r\nI do not now recall the precise circumstances that led up to the\r\nclimax; I only know that it was on one of my numerous visits to her\r\nhome, when we were alone together in the tapestried room of the\r\npale blue lanterns. Nothing had suggested to me in advance that our\r\ninterview today was to differ from our previous interviews, and\r\ncertainly nothing could have suggested such a thought to her; but\r\nsomehow the conversation drifted into unexpected channels, and we found\r\nourselves provocatively near the subject of love; and somehow her words\r\n(though I cannot now remember their trend) stirred up all my checked\r\nand slumbering emotions, forced down the barriers of my reserve, filled\r\nme with a sudden and unlooked-for courage, and urged my lips to frame\r\nwords that I had not premeditated then. And almost as much to my own\r\nsurprise as to hers, I found myself proposing that she marry me!\r\n\r\nBut was my rashness appropriately punished? Far from it. What was my\r\namazement, and what my delight, when she looked up at me with trustful,\r\ngrave blue eyes and quietly consented!\r\n\r\nAnd yet it all seemed so simple that it might have been an everyday\r\noccurrence! She had taken my proposal almost as a matter of course,\r\nalmost as if she had expected it; but at the same time the exalted and\r\nhappy light in her eyes showed that she was far from indifferent.\r\n\r\n“I was not sure before,” she murmured, simply, after my first rapturous\r\nexclamations. “But now I am quite certain. We will be all in all to one\r\nanother, will we not, my beloved?”\r\n\r\nI forgot just how I replied; I have an impression that my arms\r\nperformed some lively antics, with Aelios as their goal, and that\r\nanything I said must have been merely incidental.\r\n\r\n“When shall the day be, Aelios?” I asked, when I was again in a mood\r\nfor discussion. “When do you say?”\r\n\r\n“When do you want me to say?” she returned, as though surprised at my\r\nquery. “If we are both sure, what is the use of delaying?”\r\n\r\nAnd, by dint of further questioning, I learned that long engagements\r\nwere unknown in Atlantis. Although usually so slow-going and leisurely,\r\nthe natives seemed to me singularly hasty in this one regard; and once\r\ntwo people had decided upon marriage, it was not customary to allow\r\nmore than the few days’ interval necessary for the preparations. It\r\nhad always been so in Atlantis, Aelios explained, and she could not\r\nimagine how it could be otherwise, for why subject the young couple\r\nto the unnatural tension of waiting, and why make love ridiculous by\r\narbitrarily starving it?\r\n\r\nPreviously, when I had dared to think of the possibility of marriage\r\nwith Aelios, I had half reconciled myself to the prospect of a long\r\nengagement, since observation had taught me nothing of Atlantean\r\nmarriage customs, and I had imagined that an interval at least of\r\nmonths, might be considered proper. And so I was a little bewildered\r\nby the unexpected imminence of our union; I was like a man who, long\r\nblind, has suddenly beheld a flash of light; and it took me a little\r\nwhile to adjust myself to the startling new unfolding vistas.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I was not sure quite what was expected of me. Should I\r\npresent Aelios with a ring or similar trinket such as was customary\r\non earth? or was some more elaborate gift deemed necessary? In my\r\nperplexity, I consulted Xanocles, who merely smiled at my doubts.\r\n“Marriage with us,” he explained, “is not treated as a form of\r\nbarter; nor is it a bargain wherein precious articles must be given\r\nas sureties. We have long ago stamped out of our marriage system all\r\ntraces of its primitive origin--all traces of that old custom which\r\nregarded it merely as a contract of sale, and which in the beginning\r\ndemanded the parental receipt of cattle or other material property, and\r\nlater required rings or similar baubles as a tender of the purchase\r\nprice if not as a pledge of good faith. When two of our people are\r\nmarried, they would consider it degrading to be expected to give\r\nanything beyond themselves.”\r\n\r\nBut even after I had been relieved on this important subject, there\r\nwas still much that troubled me. Aelios had decided that but eight\r\ndays were to intervene before the ceremony (this being about the usual\r\ntime); and, despite all my joyous anticipations, I trembled just a\r\nlittle at the thought that I was so soon to exchange my known if\r\nmonotonous bachelor life for an unknown career as Atlantean husband.\r\nBut, fortunately, my hours were so completely occupied that I had\r\nlittle chance to be disturbed by doubts. For one thing, I spent a great\r\ndeal of time with Aelios; for another thing, I was much entertained\r\nby my friends, who were astonished and yet loudly congratulatory upon\r\nhearing the news, and insisted upon putting me through long ordeals of\r\nquestions, laughter, and amiable chaffing remarks. An entire meeting\r\nof the Upper World Club was given over to a celebration alleged to be\r\nin my honor; and President Gavison, after unbending from his official\r\nsternness to wish me luck in terms that I thought just a little wistful\r\nand a little reminiscent of his own lost happiness, was followed in\r\nquick succession by the various other club members, all of whom strove\r\nto express themselves with appropriate levity. Had there been such a\r\nthing as an intoxicant in Atlantis, I am sure that we would have had a\r\nmerry old time; but, for lack of the proper stimulants, the men had to\r\nbe content with their questionable jests, with poking me mirthfully in\r\nthe ribs, with slapping me heartily on the back, with expressing the\r\nwish that they might be in my shoes (or, rather, sandals, since these\r\nwere the only footwear in Atlantis), and with laughing and guffawing in\r\na generally irresponsible and uproarious manner.\r\n\r\nBut as the few remaining days slid by, did I have no thought of her\r\nwhom I had left on earth? Did I not think of Alma Huntley, she to\r\nwhom I had once pledged devotion? Perhaps I should be ashamed, but\r\nI am not, to say that the memory of her scarcely entered my mind.\r\nShe was no more than a shadow in a world that was daily growing more\r\nshadowy, in an existence I had outlived and could not expect to\r\nreenter; and if at times she would obtrude herself before me like a\r\ndim melancholy presence without color or form, such occasions were\r\ngrowing increasingly rare; and now that Aelios seemed so near and our\r\ntwo lives were so soon to be fused, Alma was obscured as a pale star\r\nis obscured by the sunlight; and all the torrents of my being welled\r\nup tumultuously toward Aelios, and it seemed as if her companionship\r\nand her love were the only love or companionship I had ever known or\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nAnd how near I was to enjoying that companionship for life became\r\nvividly apparent to me about three days after we had reached our\r\ndecision. Then it was that Aelios and I, in accordance with the custom\r\nof the land, visited the local housing bureau, which was to assign us\r\nto our new lodgings. After we had duly placed our names side by side\r\nin a great venerable-looking ledger wherein all the wedded couples of\r\nthe past hundred years were enrolled, we passed an exciting afternoon\r\nin the company of the chief housing representative, who showed us all\r\nthe available dwelling places with the same obliging courtesy as when\r\nI had selected my bachelor quarters. As on the former occasion, there\r\nwere so many desirable locations that the choice was difficult; and on\r\npassing each new threshold, Aelios would pause with a little cry of\r\nwonder or surprise, and would point in admiration to some distinctive\r\nfeature of arrangement or decoration. Needless to say, I too was\r\ndazzled and delighted; particularly since I had previously seen only\r\napartments designed for single people. None of these homes were very\r\nlarge; indeed, most of them had but three or four rooms in addition to\r\nthe roof sleeping chambers and the almost invariable central court;\r\nbut they were the most home-like little nooks one could imagine, and\r\nwere made attractive not only by the lawns and flowering gardens that\r\nsurrounded them, but by their tastefully furnished rooms, whose lamps\r\nand tapestries and statuary were never too lavish or ornate and yet\r\nalways gave an effect at once picturesque and cozy.\r\n\r\nOur choice was in favor of a little butterfly-shaped dwelling, with\r\nsilvery walls inlaid with mother-of-pearl and high-arched windows\r\nsurrounded by vivid bands of stained glass. The interior appeared\r\nentrancing to us both, for not only were the walls and ceilings\r\nfrescoed as though by a master hand, but the painted designs were\r\nmatched by the very rugs on the floor and the draperies that screened\r\nthe doorways; while a little statue-lined fountain that bubbled\r\nperpetually in the court fascinated us both by its rainbow glimmering\r\nshowers of spray.\r\n\r\n“You may move in any time after your names are registered in the\r\nMarriage Book,” said the housing representative, when we had notified\r\nhim of our decision and he had duly recorded it. “But if ever you\r\nshould find this house unsatisfactory, you have only to enter your\r\ncomplaint, and if possible we will provide you with another dwelling.\r\nBut meanwhile this will be regarded as your official residence.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd with these words the housing representative bowed a gracious\r\nretreat, while Aelios and I were left to inspect the home that was so\r\nsoon to be ours.\r\n\r\nWith the enthusiasm of children we examined every nook and corner,\r\ngrowing constantly more excited as our search proceeded; Aelios was\r\nradiant; I had never seen her eyes sparkle more brightly, her cheeks\r\nglow more vividly; and I realized as never before how extraordinarily\r\nfortunate I was.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed as if her emotions corresponded with mine! “Is it not the\r\nstrangest whim of fate,” she asked, “that you have come down here to\r\nme, my beloved? How easily I might have missed you! How easily we might\r\neach have gone through life not knowing that the other existed!”\r\n\r\n“So it has been with all lovers since the world began,” I returned.\r\n“Even in Atlantis, love must always seem a miracle.”\r\n\r\n“Even in Atlantis, it always is a miracle,” she amended; and she looked\r\nup at me with a smile so luminous and trustful, so kindly and so tinged\r\nwith a rapturous emotion, that I could not but admit that she was right.\r\n\r\nThe days that followed this delightful interview are but a blur in my\r\nmemory. Although every hour was slow-footed with the suspense and the\r\nwaiting, it seems to me that but a moment elapsed between our departure\r\nfrom our chosen home and our happy return ... the intervening events\r\nare all obscured by that never-to-be-forgotten morning when Aelios and\r\nI entered the office of the Local Adviser and were officially united.\r\n\r\nThe actual ceremony was insignificant--indeed, there was no ceremony\r\nat all. We had merely to record our names for a second time,\r\nwriting them in the Marriage Book which the housing representative\r\nhad mentioned--an enormously thick volume bound in blue and gold,\r\nwith thousands of pages, of which one was devoted to the history\r\nof each marriage. There were no questions asked us; there were no\r\nhigh-sounding formulas to be spoken by clockwork; there were no\r\nofficial representatives of saintliness to offer dogmatic advice;\r\nthere were no vows to be taken, no promises to be made, no witnesses\r\nto gape or snicker, no pompous giving or receiving of the bride. We\r\nmerely furnished the State with that record which it required, and\r\ndid so without having to purchase a preliminary printed tag by way of\r\npermission; and after we had entered our names in the book, we were not\r\ninsulted with any attempt to sanctify proceedings with words of antique\r\nwitchcraft, nor humiliated by any implication that our own feelings\r\nwould not amply solemnize the day.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we desired to celebrate our nuptials with a festival of\r\nany sort, that was our privilege--a privilege which the State would\r\nrecognize by providing an appropriate hall for the day. And, as it\r\nhappened, most bridal couples availed themselves of this right. We\r\nwere no exception, for when our marriage had been officially recorded,\r\nwe repaired to a flower-decked chamber where a few of Aelios’ friends\r\nand relatives were awaiting us. And after receiving greetings and\r\ncongratulations, we did not pass our time in feasting or drinking,\r\nnor in making merry nor in riotous jests; but we danced for a while a\r\nsedate dance timed to ethereal strains of music; and later we all sat\r\nquietly about the room, Aelios at my side and the others on mats and\r\nsofas opposite, while the lights were subdued, and we listened to a\r\nstill more ethereal music, which rose and quavered in a voice of joy\r\nlike the notes of melodious birds, then faintly trilled like a far-off\r\nelfin call or throbbed and sang in an organ-burst of ecstasy, until one\r\nwas moved almost to tears by the revealed poignancy and beauty of life,\r\nand came to look upon love with a new reverence and a new wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n                          The Flood Gates Open\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I look back now upon my life in Atlantis, my sojourn there seems\r\nto divide itself into two periods, of which the longer and by far\r\nthe more tranquil, dates from my union with Aelios. In the new-found\r\ncontentment of our marriage--and ours was no exception to the rule--we\r\nseemed to lose track of time; and months and years began gliding by at\r\na smooth and even pace that was particularly deceptive because there\r\nwere no seasons to mark the change and there were no outstanding events\r\nto serve as landmarks.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the secret lay in the fact that Aelios and I were both amply\r\noccupied; for in the hours when we were not together, we each had our\r\nown work to keep us busy. Aelios still tutored for several hours a\r\nday, and still led in the dances at public festivals; for in Atlantis\r\nno distinction was made between a married and a single woman, except\r\nin the event of motherhood; and even a mother, while released from her\r\nprescribed duties, was expected to keep alive a broad interest in life,\r\nby performing some optional services.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I was no less busy than Aelios, for after I had\r\ncompleted my “History of the Upper World,” I had again been summoned by\r\nthe Committee on Selective Assignments, and had been directed to write\r\na treatise on “Social Traditions and Institutions in the Upper World,”\r\nwherein I might describe conditions above seas in greater detail than\r\nin my previous book. This task, although far from uncongenial, was\r\nproving both lengthy and laborious, for I tried to cover every modern\r\ncountry; and the further I proceeded the harder the work became, for\r\nthe more I learned of Atlantis the more difficult it appeared to\r\nrepresent the earth in a light that was not merely pitiable.\r\n\r\nI was now quite reconciled to passing my remaining days in Atlantis.\r\nAlthough Xanocles and his colleagues persisted with their agitation,\r\nthe cause of Emergence was dwindling in my mind to an impossible dream;\r\nand, had it not been for the cataclysm which aroused us all to frenzied\r\naction, I might have been content to grow gray and wrinkled in the\r\nSunken World. For now that Aelios was mine, I found that life was far\r\nricher than ever before; that not only was I steeped in pleasurable\r\nactivity amid a delightful environment, but that there was an almost\r\ncharmed absence of strain and hurry, and a leisure and serenity that\r\nwould once have seemed the attributes only of a Nirvana.\r\n\r\nIt is true, of course, that I could not escape all the ordinary\r\nphysical ills of life. Once, for example, when my awkwardness betrayed\r\nme in an athletic contest and I suffered a broken arm, I was conducted\r\nto a State hospital, where a State physician skilfully treated my\r\ninjury; and once when the incessant golden glare began to tell upon\r\nmy eyes, I had to visit a State occulist, who relieved the strain by\r\nprescribing a pair of wide-rimmed amber-tinged glasses.\r\n\r\nMy appearance was changing, moreover, in other ways than the mere\r\naddition of glasses. I was acquiring a long beard, largely owing to\r\nthe habit formed during my first days in Atlantis; and my complexion\r\nwas taking on a curious greenish tint, due to some peculiar action\r\nof the Atlantean light--an action to which the Atlanteans themselves\r\nhad inherited immunity. But I was not alone in my queer pistache\r\ncomplexion; there were exactly thirty-eight others who could show the\r\nsame distinctive pigmentation; and so marked was the coloration that,\r\nas the men sometimes declared, our origin was “written on our skins.”\r\n\r\nMy fellow members of the Upper World Club meanwhile did not share\r\nmy liking for Atlantis. As time went by, in fact, they seemed to\r\ncare less and less for their adopted country. With the exception of\r\nGavison, who had written a brief but popular treatise on “Navigation\r\non Upper World Waters” and a not less popular “Comparison of Upper and\r\nLower World Civilizations,” there was not one of my former shipmates\r\nwho was adapting himself to life in Atlantis or who was not remiss in\r\nhis obligations as a citizen. While they had all acquired at least\r\na rudimentary knowledge of the language and were all reasonably\r\nsuccessful in performing some prescribed mechanical task for two or\r\nthree hours a day, yet none of them had accomplished anything in any\r\nof those artistic or intellectual pursuits which alone were considered\r\nworth while in Atlantis. For how, indeed, could they hope to conform\r\nto the standards of a world that had so little in common with their\r\nown? Apparently the natives did not even expect them to conform, and\r\ntolerated lapses that would have been considered disgraceful in born\r\nAtlanteans; but they themselves appeared to feel that they were somehow\r\ninferior, somehow out of place; and much of their restlessness, and\r\nmuch of their longing to escape, is to be explained by the desire for a\r\nless ideal but more familiar mode of life.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsidering the eagerness with which my companions would have exchanged\r\nthe ease of Atlantis for even the most strenuous labors and hardships\r\nof the earth, it seems ironic that the man ultimately chosen to emerge,\r\nwas he whose marriage to an Atlantean had made him more than resigned\r\nto the Sunken World. My sole excuse is that the choice, when it fell\r\nupon me, was made wholly upon the suggestion of others, and occurred\r\nat a time of such acute public peril that the happiness or fate of\r\nindividuals was as nothing.\r\n\r\nFor the hour was to come--and to come with startling suddenness--when\r\na fateful writing was to glare from the walls of Atlantis. I had been\r\nin the Sunken World seven full years when the menace burst forth, and\r\nI was not there seven days after it appeared.... But in the interval\r\nI was a witness to scenes of such havoc, such horror, confusion and\r\ndespair as I had never seen before and fervently hope I shall never see\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt torments me now to recall that all that terror and all that\r\nirremediable loss might have been avoided, had we but heeded the advice\r\nof Peliades, Peliades who insisted that the crack in the wall had not\r\nbeen adequately repaired....\r\n\r\nBut let me not anticipate. I must describe as dispassionately as I\r\ncan those overwhelming events which descended like lightning to blast\r\nAtlantean life, and which are so disturbing even in memory that my\r\npen trembles and my startled mind takes fresh alarm. Merely to try to\r\nrecord those distracting days and nights is to be obsessed as by an\r\nold madness; I can feel a paralyzing dread spreading once more through\r\nall my nerves; I can feel my brain grow numb, my eyes grow strained\r\nand distended, my arteries throb with delirious haste. And all the\r\nwhile confused visions come swarming across my mind--visions of roaring\r\nvigils by lamplit walls of glass, visions of huddled faces, weeping or\r\npraying or with terror-stricken eyes, visions of thundering waters,\r\npanicky flights, submerged temples and inundated plains; and it all\r\nseems like some nightmare I dreamt long ago, yet more vivid than any\r\nnightmare, for there are sobs and lamentations that echo even now in\r\nmy memory, and pleading lips that shall never stir again, and agonized\r\neyes that peer at me like phantoms which will not be exorcised.\r\n\r\nLong before, in moments of aimless fancy, I had sought to picture to\r\nmyself the end of the world; to imagine the consternation and horror of\r\nan earth maddened by dread of impending doom. But I had never thought\r\nthat I myself would be the spectator of a crumbling universe....\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the crack in the wall years before, the danger\r\nappeared with devastating suddenness. One moment, all was tranquil;\r\nthe next moment, the Sunken World was in a frenzy. I remember that one\r\nafternoon Aelios and I had gone to the Agripides Theatre to witness\r\na performance of some sort (its precise nature has slipped from my\r\nmind); and it was at the close of the first act that the warning came.\r\nFrom the unexplained absence of the chorus that usually sang during\r\nintermissions, I might have suspected that something was wrong; but\r\nactually I was without misgivings until suddenly a great burnished,\r\nsilvery horn--the horn of the Autophone!--was lifted quietly on the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected sight, a stab of alarm darted through me; Aelios\r\nseized my hand and held it as if for reassurance; the audience sat\r\nrigid and tense, like persons who behold a ghost. For an instant we\r\nheard no sound, except for the quick breathing of our neighbors; then\r\nthe strained silence was broken by an uncanny hollow voice that issued\r\nsonorously as if from nowhere.\r\n\r\n“A great misfortune has befallen,” announced the unseen, in tones\r\nthat sounded almost sepulchral. “The crack in the glass wall has\r\nre-appeared, but this time it is of more serious proportions than\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nThe voice faltered for an instant and halted, while murmurs of dismay,\r\nterror and unbelief shuddered through the audience.\r\n\r\nAnd in a more deliberate and even graver manner the speaker continued:\r\n“Late last evening our navigators observed that the Salty River was\r\nhigher than usual; and an investigating party sent out today by the\r\nHigh Chief Adviser has discovered that the wall has actually given\r\nway at one point, and that the water is pouring in through a fissure\r\nseveral feet across. There is as yet no cause for despair, for the\r\nsurplus water, while highly inconvenient, can be disposed of by the\r\nreserve capacity of our intra-atomic pumps, which are equipped for\r\nall ordinary emergencies and can discharge fifty per cent more than\r\ntheir usual delivery. But there is danger that the break will expand\r\nbefore repairs can be made; and for this reason the High Chief Adviser\r\nrequests that you try to meet the situation courageously, and freely\r\nenlist your brains and your services till the peril is overcome.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to convey any idea of the commotion which these\r\nwords created. The people did indeed follow the High Chief Adviser’s\r\nadvice to be courageous, for there was no more than a hint of that\r\npanic which one might have expected. But there could be no further\r\nthought of the performance in the theatre. After an instant’s chill\r\nsilence, the audience arose with one accord; and men’s faces were\r\nblanched and women could be heard muttering in fear as the crowd began\r\npushing toward the exits. In their excitement, the people had forgotten\r\ntheir usual courtesy; and Aelios and I were shoved and jostled in a way\r\nthat reminded me of the New York subways. It was all I could do not to\r\nlose track of her amid the mob; yet both of us were anxious not to be\r\nseparated, particularly since the speechless eagerness of the throng,\r\nthe sighs of women, the rapid breathing of men and our own fast-beating\r\nhearts, all served to fill us with grim forebodings.\r\n\r\nOnce out of the great theatre, the people were driven as by a common\r\ninstinct toward the river. All seemed fearful of even a second’s delay,\r\nas though our haste might repair the fractured wall!--and in a long,\r\nswiftly moving column, constantly augmented as we advanced, we followed\r\nthe winding avenue that curved toward the waterfront. None of us spoke\r\nmore than an occasional word; even Aelios was silent, but she clutched\r\nmy arm with unwonted firmness, and looked up at me with eyes wherein\r\napprehension alternated with a reassuring courage.\r\n\r\nBut there was no prop for courage in the sight that greeted us at the\r\nriver bank. The stream, which previously had flowed five or six feet\r\nbeneath the docks, was now not more than eight or ten inches below the\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nIn speechless dismay we watched that broad, greenish-gray torrent\r\ngo swishing and gurgling past. But what was there that we could do?\r\nNothing--except to stand and gape helplessly at that swift-flowing,\r\nswollen stream. Indeed, we seemed worse than merely helpless, for\r\nas I stood there with Aelios amid that horror-faced crowd, I became\r\nconscious--as during that other crisis years before--that I was\r\narousing a singular repulsion. My neighbors were edging away from me\r\nvisibly; some were pointing toward me, or uttering half-suppressed\r\noaths; I thought I heard some one ruefully mumbling something about\r\n“That foreigner” and something else about “The cause of all our\r\ntroubles.”\r\n\r\nI would quickly have withdrawn with Aelios from that hostile throng,\r\nhad I not chanced to observe a slim, gray form approaching from far\r\nupstream. With the speed of the swiftest racing craft it drew near, and\r\nin a few minutes was recognizable as an intra-atomic boat, akin to the\r\none I had boarded years before. Much to my relief, it came to a rapid\r\nhalt, drew up at the dock, and let down its gangplank. And as the crowd\r\nforced its way on to the docks, Aelios and I was not slow in finding\r\nseats for ourselves for what was sure to prove an extremely exciting\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nAnd exciting it was--far more exciting than we could have desired. We\r\nhad been under way only a few minutes when the aspect of the river\r\nbegan to change disquietingly. Except for the current, it lost the\r\ncharacter of a river entirely, and took on the appearance of a long\r\nlake! On both sides the water spread in a smooth-flowing sheet two or\r\nthree miles broad; and above the surface in places stared dumps and\r\ndusters of vegetation, with here and there a miniature island; while\r\nseveral temples and colonnades stood with marble bases buried in the\r\nwater, like the palaces of some aquatic goddess.\r\n\r\nBut if this overflow was alarming, the full extent of the disaster was\r\nnot evident until we approached the glass wall itself. This time it\r\ndid not require any searchlight to reveal the nature of the injury;\r\nour ears might have told us if our eyes had not--but our eyes had\r\nsufficient to report. As we strode along the little, clay path toward\r\nthe wall, we became aware of a broad, gleaming, greenish expanse\r\nbetween--a sheet of water where all had been dry land! And into that\r\nsheet of water, with a continuous thunder equal to that of the floods\r\nfrom the river valve, a long, white torrent spurted in a gracefully\r\ncurving jet, shooting outward hundreds of yards from the glass bulwark,\r\nand descending with a splashing as of some gigantic fountain. It\r\nwas impossible to estimate the volume, except to say that it was\r\nenormous; nor could we see the nature or extent of the leak, since the\r\nintervening water forbade our close approach. But we observed how the\r\noverflow worked its way circuitously into the Salty River in a sort of\r\nchannel of its own choosing; and occasional swift-moving lights, which\r\neven from our distance we could see flashing from beyond the glass,\r\nshowed us that the repair ships were busy trying to seal up the crack.\r\nBut from the beginning we knew how hopeless were their efforts--with\r\ntheir midget vessels and midget tools they were like ants trying to\r\nstem the flood of a Niagara. And the utter helplessness of their\r\nplight--and of ours--became tragically apparent when suddenly a great\r\nelongated, gray mass came flying in with the torrents from the sea, and\r\nfell with a splash and a clatter in a battered heap projecting above\r\nthe waters--a rescuing submarine that had been hurled in through the\r\ngap in the wall!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Almost before I realized that the ultimate moment had\r\ncome, I found myself assisting Aelios up the half-submerged gangplank\r\nand on to the deck of the grim, low-lying, shadowy ship ... we mounted\r\nto the deck, cast a last glance at the darkness that hid the marble\r\ntemples of Atlantis, and waved for the last time to the dim watching\r\nfigures.]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n                            Swollen Torrents\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was five days later that I received the summons from the High\r\nChief Adviser ... and made ready for the most extraordinary of all my\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nIn the interval, all Atlantis was in a state verging upon madness.\r\nThe commotion created by the original discovery of the crack was\r\ninsignificant beside the terror that now dominated every inhabitant.\r\nTo say that the country seemed stricken with paralysis would be to\r\nunderstate the conditions; rather, it was driven to a dumb distraction,\r\nlike some great beast that feels its foot in a trap. Only one thought\r\nwas in anyone’s mind, only one topic on anyone’s lips; the people\r\ndrifted hither and thither like phantoms, rushing back and forth\r\nbetween the cities and the spurting leak in the wall, sometimes engaged\r\nfurtively in whispered discussions, on other occasions muttering\r\nhalf-audible prayers or withdrawing into themselves like men brought\r\nface to face with Fate. Some would hover near the offices of the High\r\nChief Adviser, awaiting hopeful news that did not come; some would\r\nhaunt the river banks, watching the swelling torrents go murmuring and\r\nwhirling past; some would huddle together in small family groups, as\r\nthough mortally afraid to lose sight of their dear ones; some would\r\nmerely go pacing around like rats in a cage, scarcely heeding where\r\nthey went, their white faces and harried eyes expressive of a dread\r\nthey dared not mention.\r\n\r\nBut none--none who were not driven by the most stringent orders--were\r\nheeding their daily duties. For the first time in history, the cities\r\nwere inadequately supplied with food; the official producers and\r\ndistributors shared the general inertia, and the people had to clamor\r\nat the doors of the great municipal warehouses for their meager\r\nrations; and actual starvation seemed certain unless the workers could\r\nbe urged back to the fields.\r\n\r\nBut more appalling to my mind--vastly more appalling, since it seemed\r\nlike the overthrow of the very order of nature--was the laxity with\r\nregard to the golden orbs that ruled the Atlantean day. Owing no\r\ndoubt to the negligence of the official in charge, the clockwork that\r\ncontrolled these artificial suns ran down on what should have been\r\nthe third night, and the luminaries continued in full blaze after the\r\nusual hour of darkness. But few seemed even to notice the change, and\r\nmost continued frenziedly watching the waters or awaiting encouraging\r\nreports; while those that could, snatched a few hours of troubled sleep\r\nduring the continuous daylight, and many still kept their useless\r\nvigils with drawn faces and weary eyes.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Salty River continued to rise. Slowly and insidiously,\r\nby inches and by half inches, it crept up and up, up and up, until\r\nafter two days not more than a hand’s breadth separated it from the\r\ntop of the embankment. And after three days it had not more than a\r\nfinger’s breadth to go, while on the fourth day we could see thin,\r\nsparkling streams flowing down the more low-lying street, not deep\r\nenough to make them quite impassable, but lending to the columned\r\nthoroughfares the aspect of some pathetic Venice. Simultaneously the\r\nAutophone brought news that the small towns of Malgos and Dorion had\r\nbeen inundated and that their inhabitants had fled for higher ground;\r\nthat the larger cities of Atolis, Lerenon, and Aedla were rearing\r\nembankments to keep out the waters, and that the farm lands of eastern\r\nAtlantis were flooded as far as the eye could see. But little that was\r\neven mildly hopeful was reported. It was stated that the repair ships\r\nwere still trying to cope with the leak, though without success; that\r\nthe intra-atomic pumps were disposing of most of the surplus water,\r\nbut were being taxed to capacity; that in several places huge electric\r\nshovels were at work, digging out great hollows into which the floods\r\nmight be drained; that efforts were being made to freeze huge masses of\r\nwater, and force the ice against the wall, in the attempt to stem the\r\ntorrents.... But all the while the river continued to rise, and nothing\r\nshort of a miracle seemed likely to check disaster.\r\n\r\nAfter five days the water was flowing to a depth of many inches through\r\nhalf the streets of Archeon; and only the rapid erection of earthworks\r\nhad saved the other half. And it was after five nerve-racking days\r\nthat--as I have stated--I received the summons from the High Chief\r\nAdviser.\r\n\r\nThe messenger--a wan-faced old man who seemed to be in a breathless\r\nhurry--was waiting for me when I returned home with Aelios after\r\nstrolling aimlessly for hours through the unflooded portions of the\r\ntown. From the grave attitude with which he greeted me, I knew at once\r\nthat something was amiss; but he had no explicit information to offer.\r\n“The High Chief Adviser wishes to see you without delay,” was all that\r\nhe would report. And having uttered these words, he began edging away\r\nas though he had immediate business elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere being nothing else to do, I accompanied this singular messenger\r\nafter hastily assuring Aelios that I would return as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAs I might have anticipated, our walk turned out to be far from\r\npleasant. The old man had evidently been long trained in diplomacy,\r\nfor I could not induce him to speak except non-committally and in\r\nmonosyllables. And all the way to the office of the Adviser I was left\r\nto my own conjectures, while we skirted public squares that looked like\r\nlakes or waded ankle-deep through the salty water.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArriving at the many-domed sandstone edifice where the Atlantean\r\ngovernment had its headquarters, my companion bade me wait in a\r\nbook-lined anteroom, and went to notify his chief of my arrival. It was\r\nas though my coming had been awaited, for the old man had hardly left\r\nme when he reappeared and motioned me to follow him.\r\n\r\nI have a vague remembrance of accompanying him through long, arched\r\ngalleries; but of these my mind retains no definite impression, and\r\nthe next thing I dearly recall is that I stood in a little blue-walled\r\nroom before an impressive-looking elderly man whose picture I had often\r\nseen. His long, furrowed, sagacious features were manifestly those of\r\na scholar, but there was a squareness about the jaw that marked him\r\nalso as a man of action; while at the same time there was a patriarchal\r\nbenignity about the sympathetic lines of the face. But one quality\r\nthere was which dominated him now, and which none of the pictures had\r\nshown: an air of utter fatigue, of melancholy, almost of despair, all\r\ntoo plainly written in the hollows that underlined the weary, gray\r\neyes, in the pale cheeks almost totally drained of blood, and in the\r\nhaggard expression as of one who has not slept for days.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the High Chief Adviser was seated a man whom I\r\nrecognized with surprise. It was Xanocles, also looking pallid and\r\nworn--and as he rose to greet me I began to conceive some faint idea\r\nwhy I had been summoned.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Adviser gravely motioned me to a seat at his left; and as\r\nI sank into the cushioned chair he plunged without formality into an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n“I need hardly tell you,” he commenced, speaking rapidly but in dull,\r\nsober tones, “how serious is the crisis that confronts Atlantis.\r\nBut perhaps no one--except those of us who are on the inside of\r\naffairs--realizes quite how acute the danger is. Frankly speaking, we\r\nare incapable of dealing with the emergency. The intra-atomic pumps\r\nhave been working to capacity for five days, forcing out fifty per cent\r\nmore than their usual volume; but, even so, the water is pouring in\r\nat the rate of several tons a second faster than we can drive it out.\r\nThis in itself would indicate a grave enough peril; but this is not the\r\nworst. Our engineers tell us that the crack is extending to portions of\r\nthe wall previously unaffected, and that new sections may give way at\r\nany time. When this happens, it will be--the end.”\r\n\r\nThe High Chief Adviser paused, bleakly frowning; then, with a piercing\r\nglance at me, as if to see whether I had anticipated his meaning, he\r\ncontinued, “It is apparent that Atlantis cannot save itself. We are\r\nfacing a peril unique in history, and have not the weapons with which\r\nto combat it. If help comes, it must come from outside. And that is why\r\nI have summoned you.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t exactly see--” I began.\r\n\r\n“Let me explain,” the official continued, impatiently. “You yourself of\r\ncourse can do nothing. But you come from a people who, to judge from\r\nyour writings, have developed remarkable engineering and mechanical\r\nskill. I am hopeful that their science may be able to devise some means\r\nof saving us, and for that reason I am planning to send you above seas\r\nfor help. What do you think of the idea?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I--I think it might be worth trying,” was all I was able to gasp\r\nin reply.\r\n\r\n“Your friend Xanocles also thinks it worth trying,” proceeded the\r\nAdviser suavely. “Now I personally have always been against the policy\r\nof Emergence; but it is imperative to try new measures; and at a time\r\nlike this, fortunately, the law empowers me to take any action on my\r\nown initiative. And so I sent for Xanocles today as one of the most\r\nprominent local members of the Emergence Party, and when I asked whom\r\nhe would advise me to appoint as special envoy to the upper world he\r\nhad no hesitation about mentioning you.”\r\n\r\n“But why me?” I demanded, doubtful of my qualifications for so high an\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n“Well, to be sure, you were not the only one,” stated the Adviser. “He\r\nalso recommended a certain Gavison, but we have decided to hold him in\r\nreserve, and if you do not return in a few days we will send him out\r\nwith a second submarine. Meanwhile, if you would care to accept--”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course--of course I’ll accept--if it is for the good of\r\nAtlantis,” I declared. “But just what would you expect of me?”\r\n\r\n“One of our submersible vessels, with a crew of four men, will be in\r\nreadiness at the docks early tomorrow morning. You will board it, and\r\nit will bear you out through the eastern valve and to any part of\r\nthe upper world you may direct. But you are to waste no time about\r\ninforming your fellows of the menace that confronts Atlantis. They too\r\nhave submersible vessels, as your arrival here proves--let them send\r\nsome of their ships down here, if they can, with materials to repair\r\nthe wall. But above all things, you must remember not to delay, not to\r\ndelay!”\r\n\r\n“I will do my best,” I promised. “But let me not hold out any false\r\nhopes--I am not sure that the upper world will be able to assist.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate, you can try,” sighed the Head of the Atlantean\r\ngovernment. “It is a chance worth taking. We lose nothing by the\r\nattempt.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, fixing on me that powerful magnetic glance common to all the\r\nAtlanteans, he demanded, “You will spare no effort?”\r\n\r\n“I will spare no effort,” I solemnly vowed.\r\n\r\n“Then the fates be with you!” And the High Chief Adviser rose and\r\nfirmly took both my hands; and I thought that just a trace of emotion\r\ndimmed his eyes as he fervently continued, “I need say no more. You\r\nknow as well as I how much depends upon this. Above all things,\r\nHarkness, you will make haste, you will make haste, will you not?\r\nGood-bye--and good fortune will be yours!”\r\n\r\nAnd the next moment, accompanied by Xanocles, I was passing through\r\nthe outer galleries. The last glimpse I caught of the High Adviser\r\nshowed me the great head wearily sagging, the lids drooping over the\r\nmelancholy gray eyes as if in utmost renunciation or despair.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the Adviser’s office I hastened straight home, leaving Xanocles,\r\nafter being assured that he would come to me early in the morning.\r\n\r\nI found Aelios impatiently awaiting my return. “You have been long,”\r\nshe murmured, although it seemed to me that I had come back very\r\nquickly. And the big, blue eyes looked up at me inquiringly, and I had\r\nto explain at once the meaning of the Adviser’s summons.\r\n\r\nShe followed my recital without a word; but heavy furrows began to\r\nappear upon her brow when I told her how serious was the plight of\r\nAtlantis; and a big limpid teardrop flowed unheeded down her cheek.\r\n\r\n“You did right to accept the commission,” she said, coming to me when\r\nI had finished my story, and resting one hand affectionately upon my\r\nshoulder. And a deep melancholy made moist her eyes as she continued,\r\n“I am glad that the choice has fallen upon you. When do we start on our\r\nvoyage?”\r\n\r\n“We?” I repeated, staring at her in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we. I intend to go with you, of course.”\r\n\r\n“But, Aelios, that’s impossible!” I exclaimed, springing up and drawing\r\nher closely to me. “You know how much I’d like to have you with me. But\r\nyou don’t seem to realize the peril.”\r\n\r\n“Peril?” She laughed disdainfully, as she withdrew from me. “Do you\r\nthink I’d have you submit to a peril I wouldn’t share in? Besides, is\r\nit not in the interest of my own country? Should I stay here doing\r\nnothing when I might help to save Atlantis?”\r\n\r\n“But, even so, would you be permitted--” I started to protest.\r\n\r\n“Of course I’d be permitted! The High Chief Adviser would be more than\r\nwilling--only, of course, he wouldn’t ask me to take the risk.”\r\n\r\n“And neither would I ask you--” I objected; but she cut me short by\r\ndemanding, sharply, “Do you think it’s any greater than the risk of\r\nstaying here?” And, with the air of one whose mind is made up and is\r\nnot to be questioned, she reminded me, “We better be getting ready, for\r\nI don’t suppose we’ll have any time to waste.”\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon, the question having been settled, we began our meager\r\npreparations. But we found that there was not much to prepare, for of\r\ncourse the submarine would be well provisioned; and, except for a few\r\npersonal trinkets, we could think of little to take away with us. But\r\nit occurred to me to bring a copy of Homer’s lost masterpiece, the\r\n“Telegonus,” which might convince the upper world of the truth of my\r\nreports about Atlantis. And it also occurred to me to pay a pilfering\r\nexpedition to the museum, which was now untenanted even by the doormen;\r\nand, when I returned, my pockets were weighed down with several pieces\r\nof gold, and my arms were laden with a large amorphous bundle, whose\r\ncontents might have been identified as an Ensign’s uniform.\r\n\r\nOf the night that followed I have only the most confused and disturbing\r\nremembrance. I know that I did not sleep, except to drowse away by\r\nbrief, nightmare-haunted spells; and I also know that Aelios did not\r\nsleep, for her mind like mine was busy contemplating the adventure\r\nbefore us. Yet we were both too weary for connected thought; and\r\njumbled visions were all that greeted us as we lay there speechless in\r\nthe blackness.\r\n\r\nThe moment the lights were flashed on again we renounced our futile\r\nattempts at slumber. And we had hardly risen and made ourselves\r\npresentable when we began to receive visitors. Not only did Xanocles\r\narrive as he had promised, but the entire Upper World Club appeared in\r\na group, for I had notified Gavison of my prospective departure and had\r\nexpressed my desire to see all the men again before I left.\r\n\r\nSince all our visitors insisted on seeing us off, it was a good-sized\r\ncompany that attended us as we bade farewell to the butterfly-shaped\r\nbuilding that had housed us so long, and set off through the streets of\r\nthe stricken city toward the river. Yet our escort, while large, was\r\nfar from merry, for the strain of the past few days was written upon\r\nus all, and the pale cheeks and weary looks of my companions matched\r\ntheir listless manner and their silence. One or two--and among them the\r\nunquenchable Stranahan--did indeed attempt to be jocular; but their\r\nefforts were half-hearted and flat, and their laughter rang thin and\r\nhollow like mockery; and as we drew nearer our goal and saw the flood\r\nrippling through the streets ahead, we heard no more of their jests,\r\nbut all of us plunged onward speechlessly and with stern, set faces,\r\noppressed as though by the shadow of some solemn and awful presence.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the inundated districts, I of course urged my\r\ncompanions to turn back. But they paid no heed, and pressed gravely on\r\ntheir way, first wading ankle-deep, then halfway to their knees, while\r\nstrung out in a long line among scattered houses that looked like lake\r\ndwellings. Here a marble edifice, there a colonnade, yonder a cluster\r\nof statues, projected above the deluge, whose green-gray current went\r\nswishing past as though from an inexhaustible source. Amid those fluid\r\nwastes, which had obliterated all familiar landmarks and gave to well\r\nknown things a new and terrible majesty, it was impossible to be sure\r\nof our way; and once one of the men slipped into a depression so deep\r\nthat he had to swim to save himself; and more than once some one\r\ntripped over some buried obstacle, and went floundering at full length\r\ninto the water, thereby provoking a short-lived outburst of mirth. So\r\ngreat were the dangers that we had to move very slowly; but we also\r\nmoved with grim regularity, and our progress was without sound other\r\nthan the monotonous splash, splash of our advancing feet.\r\n\r\nYet it was not only our own plight that made us moody and sad. As we\r\nplodded through the flooded districts, we had continual glimpses of\r\nthe inhabitants--and in their aspect and manner there was nothing to\r\nreassure us. Here, through an open window, we would catch sight of\r\nseveral agile figures straining to bind some huge collection into a\r\nbundle; there we would observe a man descending from his doorstep\r\ninto the enveloping waters, his back bent down with a great pile of\r\nhousehold articles, a wan-faced woman clinging nervously to him or\r\nturning back with moist eyes to the home they were leaving. And we\r\npassed not one or two such refugees but scores, literally scores.\r\nOne would have a three-year-old perched securely on his shoulder,\r\nanother would be trying to soothe a crying babe or leading by the hand\r\na frightened lad of five; some would be bearing off great heaps of\r\nclothing or huge cans and boxes that looked like food containers, and a\r\nfew were puffing and panting to save their books, rugs and paintings.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the eyes of all the people were baleful with a wild,\r\nunnatural light; their features were assuming a furtive, hunted\r\nexpression; their voices had lost their music, and had grown nervous\r\nand shrill. And all were looking bloodless and bedraggled; ominous\r\nhollows were forming in their cheeks and beneath their eyes; their\r\nclothes were soiled and untended, their beards scraggly and untrimmed;\r\nand many had lost their normal restraint, so that we passed a woman\r\nwho sobbed and sobbed quite regardless of our approach, an old man who\r\ngrowled and gibbered insanely to himself, and more than one that did\r\nnot even seem to see us, but stared upward intently with imploring\r\nface, while mumbling incoherent melancholy phrases.\r\n\r\nWhen finally we drew near our destination, the water reached to the\r\nknees of the tallest of us, and our progress was more laborious and\r\nslower than ever. I now began to fear that we would not be able to\r\nlocate the river bank, for how tell where the shallow water ended and\r\nthe deep began? At length, however, I was relieved to observe a wide,\r\nunbroken flowing expanse several hundred yards ahead, and to note that\r\na long rope, stretched in the water between improvised wooden supports,\r\nmarked the river’s theoretical edge.\r\n\r\nIt was just when we came in sight of our goal that the supreme horror\r\nbefell. Even to this day I can recapture the amazement and alarm\r\nof that dread moment; and the abruptness of it all and the terror\r\noverwhelm me anew. Had the waters swelled and swept over us in a tidal\r\nwave, I would have been panic-stricken and yet halfway prepared--but\r\nI could not have anticipated that the blow was to strike from above\r\nrather than from beneath.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly--although this was only the beginning of the Atlantean\r\nday--the golden lights of the glass dome began to waver and flicker,\r\nthen paled to a twilight glow, then (in less time than it takes to\r\nstate) snapped into blackness.\r\n\r\nSo startled were we that we stood there transfixed; scarcely an oath\r\nissued from our petrified lips. The darkness was absolute; we could\r\nnot see our nearest neighbors; we seemed walled in by oblivion. For a\r\nmoment there was silence; then came a light splashing to my left, and\r\nsimultaneously dozens of voices burst forth bewilderingly in terror and\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\nAnd when that first horrified outburst was dying down, there crept\r\nover us from a distance other cries--confused cries as of many voices\r\nsighing and wailing in chorus. And all those voices seemed to form into\r\none, and to grieve and drone in a single long-drawn sob, with echoes\r\nreminding me uncannily of lost souls mourning in the dark.\r\n\r\nBut soon that melancholy tumult passed away; and we were aware only\r\nthat we stood there knee-deep in the flood, in a silence unbroken\r\nexcept by the gurgling waters.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the most quick-witted of us all came to his senses.\r\nSuddenly a vivid light stabbed the gloom just to my left; and by its\r\nglaring yellow illumination I could make out the tall form of Xanocles.\r\n\r\nIn his hands was a good-sized pocket flashlight. “I was a little afraid\r\nthis might happen,” he declared, trying to be matter-of-fact, and\r\nspeaking loudly enough for us all to hear. “Lucky I had these lanterns\r\nwith me.” And, to our surprise, he calmly drew several more flashlights\r\nfrom the folds of his garments, and passed them to his nearest\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\n“The High Chief Adviser warned me yesterday that this was possible,” he\r\nexplained. “And so I thought it best to be prepared.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, while we all stood gaping at him like men with paralyzed\r\nminds, he continued, soothingly, “There is really nothing to be\r\nalarmed about. The water must have gotten into the electric power\r\ngenerators--that is all. In a few hours the lights will no doubt be\r\nshining again.”\r\n\r\nBut his words did not carry conviction. In his voice was a note of\r\nconcern that he could not wholly exclude; and as we glanced nervously\r\ninto the gloom--a gloom that was all-enveloping except for our\r\nflashlights and an occasional firefly flicker in the far distance--we\r\ncould not believe that the golden luminaries would soon beam upon us\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn procession that started splashing once more toward\r\nthe river bank. Guided by the sallow illumination of the flashlights,\r\nwe could barely find our course; and step by step, with laborious\r\nslowness, we plodded through the unrelenting flood. None of us could\r\nfind the heart to utter a word; and from time to time, among my shadowy\r\nattendants, I caught glimpses of lips rigidly compressed and faces\r\nfirmly set, as among men who go forth to meet the Ultimate. All the\r\nwhile Aelios was at my side, hovering close as if for shelter; and when\r\nI could I helped her over the more difficult places, though she too was\r\nspeechless, like one whose thoughts are too appalling for expression.\r\n\r\nThen, for an instant, hope came flashing back. A sudden radiance burst\r\nupon us from above; the great luminaries were once more touched with\r\nlight, which fitfully expanded from a pale red glow almost to the\r\nnormal golden--and then fitfully died out into utter gloom.\r\n\r\nAnd our cries of rejoicing were frozen on our lips, and the darkness\r\nthat ensued seemed more intense than ever. And once more there was only\r\nthe silence, the wavering flashlights and the whirling floods.\r\n\r\nGroping and floundering and sometimes sinking almost up to the hips in\r\nwater, we at last found ourselves near the rope that marked the river’s\r\nverge. And by turning upstream toward a dim but steady yellow light, we\r\nmanaged to locate the docks and the submarine, which we recognized by\r\nthe radiance filtering through the portholes.\r\n\r\nThen, almost before I realized that the ultimate moment had come, I\r\nfound myself assisting Aelios up the half-submerged gangplank and on to\r\nthe deck of the grim, low-lying, shadowy ship. The next that I remember\r\nis that I was back again in two feet of water, and that a multitude of\r\nhands clasped mine, a multitude of voices were lifted simultaneously,\r\nfirst the voices of a mob attempting a cheer that died prematurely,\r\nthen the voices of individuals, shouting out advice and farewells,\r\nwishing me a safe voyage, entreating me to make haste for the good of\r\nAtlantis. I have a recollection of seeing the earnest, grave face of\r\nGavison by the uncertain, shifting illumination of the flashlights; the\r\nelongated, intellectual face of Xanocles; the youthful but sad-eyed\r\nand frightened face of Rawson, and Stranahan’s droll countenance now\r\nfurrowed almost into a tragic severity.\r\n\r\nBut in an instant all these faces--so familiar to me, and so well\r\nliked--had drifted out of view. I too stood upon the gangplank, lightly\r\nwaving although my heart seemed dull and dead within me. Then I mounted\r\nto the deck, cast a last glance at the darkness that hid the marble\r\ntemples of Atlantis, and waved for the last time to the dim watching\r\nfigures. And as the flashlights began slowly to retreat, I descended\r\na narrow stairway, heard an iron door clatter to a close above me,\r\nfelt a jolt and a shudder that were followed by a regular, incessant\r\nquivering--and knew that I was on my way back to the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n                               The Return\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts of my return from Atlantis have been reported so widely that\r\nit would be futile for me to dwell upon them. It is generally known\r\nhow, having crossed the ocean at the sixty-knot speed made possible by\r\nour intra-atomic propellers, our submarine found its way to the mouth\r\nof the Potomac and almost up to Washington; how, after it had anchored\r\nobscurely some distance below the city, I donned my old uniform and\r\nmade my way out under cover of night; how I hastened the next day\r\nto the offices of the naval department, disclosed my identity, and\r\nmet with ridicule not only at my incredible tale, but at my strange\r\nappearance, my long beard, my goggles and my greenish skin.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the haste and confusion of my departure from the\r\nSunken World, I had made one oversight. I had forgotten the copy of\r\nHomer’s lost “Telegonus,” which I had hoped to exhibit in verification\r\nof my story! Scattered lines of the poem, to be sure, did keep trailing\r\nthrough my mind with a wild, ringing majesty--but they were the merest\r\nfragments, and to recite them would have been to brand myself as a\r\nmadman. Yet I had little other evidence to display. Aelios could\r\nnot help me, for she could not speak English; and in spite of her\r\nexceptional beauty, there would have been nothing to prove that she had\r\nnot been born above seas. And as for the four members of the submarine\r\ncrew, they refused stanchly to leave the vessel; and, besides, they\r\nlikewise could not speak English, and their fantastic Atlantean garb\r\nwould no doubt have marked them also as lunatics.\r\n\r\nAnd so there was nothing to do but wait, wait for days and days,\r\nhaunting the naval offices, making myself a laughing stock and a\r\nnuisance, yet repeating my pleas so insistently that in the end they\r\nhad to be heeded. But meanwhile I was losing time--time which I knew\r\nto be all-important. Even now Atlantis might be in a death-grip with\r\nthe waters; and the difference of a few hours might bridge the gap\r\nbetween safety and disaster. Would not my fellows make haste? was the\r\nquestion I kept asking and asking; and all the while they remained\r\ninactive and unmoved. Every day, with tears in her eyes, Aelios would\r\ninquire when the rescuing expedition was to set out; and every day I\r\nwould nod sadly, and sigh, “Perhaps tomorrow.” But tomorrow would bring\r\nlittle hope; and even when at last an investigation was undertaken, it\r\nwas careless and dilatory--and it was long before I could convince the\r\nbewildered inspectors that I was actually one of the company of the\r\nlost X-111.\r\n\r\nIt was long, indeed, before I could even find any one to identify me.\r\nIn a land where my acquaintances had been legion, I was apparently\r\nunknown; and my old friends had either been dispersed or else I had\r\nslipped out of their minds. Even Alma Huntley failed to reply to my\r\nletters; and it was months before I learned that, having long given me\r\nup as lost, she had left two years before for the Pacific Coast as the\r\nbride of the Reverend David Mosely.\r\n\r\nBut though my messages to Alma never reached their destination, a\r\nletter to my old friend, Frank Everett, survived many forwardings and\r\nfound its goal; and not only did Everett hasten to me from New York,\r\nbut he summoned others of our former group, whose testimony combined\r\nwith the evidence of finger-prints and handwriting to identify me\r\nbeyond dispute.\r\n\r\nMatters now began to move more quickly--in fact, with a rapidity that\r\nwas bewildering. Almost overnight my story was flashed from end to end\r\nof the land, and I found myself a public figure. Newspaper headlines\r\nflaunted my name, and the word Atlantis was on every one’s lips;\r\ninterviewers came swarming to see me, scientists with their demands\r\nfor information, the heads of lecture bureaus and of motion picture\r\ncorporations with their golden offers. But all that really interested\r\nme were the offers of assistance for the Sunken World. Several men\r\nof means became interested, and placed large funds at our disposal,\r\nso making possible the Harkness Institute for Marine Research; half\r\na dozen engineers volunteered to accompany me back to Atlantis, and\r\nwith their aid we secured implements and chemicals capable of sealing\r\nwide breaches in a glass wall. But we could produce no vessel other\r\nthan that in which we had left Atlantis, for the naval submarines were\r\nnot equipped for the deep waters of the Sunken World; and so when\r\nfinally the rescuing party set off down the Potomac from Washington,\r\nits members numbered only six in addition to Aelios and myself and the\r\noriginal crew.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe small size of this expedition and its limited equipment would\r\nalone have made us doubtful of success; but we remembered with acute\r\nmisgivings that two full months had passed since we left Archeon, and\r\nthat during all this time the flood waters must have been rising. We\r\nwere particularly uneasy because of the failure of Gavison to appear\r\nin a second submarine, as the High Chief Adviser had promised; and,\r\nbrooding upon his absence, we would recall how we had bidden farewell\r\nto Atlantis, and would think with a shudder of the bleak confusion of\r\nthe people and the swelling torrents swishing through the darkness.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse (if they could possibly be worse) our voyage\r\nback to Atlantis was beset with unforeseen difficulties. Owing to the\r\nabsence of definite charts and our uncertainty as to the latitude and\r\nlongitude of the Sunken World, we were lost for several days amid\r\nthe wildest wastes of the Atlantic. At times we would dive to the\r\nsea bottom, or to such depths that Atlantis could not conceivably be\r\nbeneath us, and would go cruising for hours amid that black infinity or\r\nalong the shell-strewn or bouldery floor of the ocean, staring through\r\nthe portholes at the luminous-eyed creatures that flitted ghost-like\r\nabout us, and here and there gaping horror-stricken at some contorted\r\nbut strangely eloquent rusty iron mass. But of Atlantis itself there\r\nwas no sign, and we had the queer impression that it had dissolved\r\nbubble-like amid the watery immensity.\r\n\r\nAnd so at length our expedition converted itself into little more than\r\na random questing after what did not appear to exist. Should we ever\r\nagain catch a glimpse of the green-golden walls of our lost universe?\r\nThere were moments when I was given to curious doubts, and felt that\r\nAtlantis, once lost, could never be found again; that the billows would\r\ncover it as completely from our sight as from the sight of the ages.\r\nBut all the time, while we kept dashing at prodigious speed through the\r\nvacant waters, we were given to strange fits of hope that alternated\r\nwith spells of despair,--hope when we would descry a far-off light that\r\nwould turn out to be merely some elusive fishy lantern,--despair that\r\nour help, already too long delayed, was being retarded to the point of\r\nimpotence.\r\n\r\nThe final discovery came with startling suddenness. One day, gliding\r\nslowly downward at a considerable depth, we were stopped by a hard,\r\nflat barrier that spread beneath us like the sea bottom. But as\r\nwe began to drift horizontally, we observed that the surface was\r\nsmooth and ominously light-reflecting--and with a gasp of despair we\r\nrecognized that the substance was glass!\r\n\r\nThe surprise and horror of that moment are still vivid in my memory.\r\n“Turn the searchlights down, down!” muttered the leader of our crew,\r\nin a voice that trembled perceptibly; and as the great water-piercing\r\nstreamers began to quiver and shake and then slowly descended in long,\r\nrambling curves, Aelios came rushing to my side like a child who fears\r\nto be alone, and clung closely to me while we both stared through the\r\nportholes with faces rigid and eager.\r\n\r\nBut at first we saw nothing. All was dark beneath us--not a gleam, not\r\na flicker, broke the blackness of the Sunken World.\r\n\r\nThen, as the searchlights swayed and shifted till they swept the depths\r\ndirectly beneath, we began to make out familiar objects amid the\r\nobscurity. Dimly, strangely, as though draped in a fog, the outlines of\r\ngreat domes and arches and colonnades began to emerge, interspersed by\r\nTitanic columns and statuesque temples that appeared to waver uncannily.\r\n\r\n“See! See! It is still there!” Aelios cried, frantically, as she\r\npressed more closely to me; and with the agony of despair in her voice\r\nwas mingled just a tinge of hope.\r\n\r\nI took her hand and sought to console her; but even as I did so her\r\nwhole body began to shake spasmodically, and her sobbing throbbed from\r\nend to end of the ship. For many minutes she seemed unable to speak.\r\n\r\nYet, even while the long-drawn, heartbreaking sobs panted forth, she\r\nbegan to point, to point distractedly downward, with blind, quivering\r\nfingers that called with frenzied urgency, forcing me to peer again\r\nthrough the porthole.\r\n\r\nWith my arms still about her, I scanned the dim, ghostly twilight.\r\nBut for a moment I observed nothing alarming. Then, as my gaze\r\nbecame focused upon a gray dome just below, I too cried out in dread\r\nrealization.\r\n\r\nThose glass-covered depths were not without sign of life, as I had\r\nthought; but here and there a lantern-bearing object, with flapping\r\nfinny body, went wavering through the windows and above the temple\r\nroofs!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was transcribed from _Amazing Stories Quarterly_, Summer\r\n1928 (vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 292–377).\r\n\r\nThe section titles “Foreword” and “Introduction” were not present in\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nObvious errors in spelling, hyphenation and punctuation have been\r\nsilently corrected in this version, but minor inconsistencies and\r\narchaic forms have been retained as printed.
