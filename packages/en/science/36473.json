KLAAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause its unique geographical location and ecological setting\r\nsupports a rich and varied avifauna, the Yucatan Peninsula has received\r\nconsiderable attention by ornithologists. The most valuable\r\ncontribution is Paynter's \"The Ornithogeography of the Yucatan\r\nPeninsula\" (1955a), an authoritative study of the composition,\r\ndistribution, and origin of the avifauna of the region. His work\r\ncontains a complete listing of all species reported to that time from\r\nthe peninsula. It considers the hundreds of specimens collected by the\r\nauthor and his associates during many months of field work, provides a\r\nsynthesis of all the information available to 1955, and is the basic\r\nreference to the avifauna of the area. Paynter also pointed out matters\r\nfor which information is lacking. Two of the most conspicuous deficits\r\nthat he noted are the lack of knowledge about many species that occur\r\non the peninsula in summer, and the paucity of data as to time of\r\nbreeding, although some information on reproduction in a few species\r\nwas published subsequently by Paynter (1955b) and Storer (1961).\r\n\r\nIn July and August of 1962, I was a member of a field party from the\r\nMuseum of Natural History, The University of Kansas, engaged in a\r\nsurvey of vertebrates and their ectoparasites on the Yucatan Peninsula.\r\nThe purpose of the present paper is to report on the birds collected\r\nand observed during the course of this field work. Particular emphasis\r\nis given to breeding information, but observations concerning\r\ndistribution, incidence, and molt also are given. In addition, a list\r\nof the chewing lice (Mallophaga) taken from various specimens is given\r\nin Table 2 and in the appropriate species account of the host. Other\r\nectoparasites removed from these birds will be reported on elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI am especially indebted to Dr. J. Knox Jones, Jr., under whose\r\ndirection this field study was undertaken, and to Dr. Richard F.\r\nJohnston who aided greatly in the identification of specimens and\r\ncritical reading of the manuscript. I am grateful also to other members\r\nof the field party who helped in collecting many of the specimens\r\nreported herein: Ticul Alvarez, A. Binion Amerson, Dr. William E.\r\nDuellman, Dr. J. Knox Jones, Jr., Thomas E. Lovejoy, III, Jack G.\r\nMakepeace, Dwight R. Platt, William C. Stanley, Jerome B. Tulecke, and\r\nJohn Wellman. Dr. K. C. Emerson graciously identified the specimens of\r\nMallophaga and Dr. Allan R. Phillips aided in identification of some of\r\nthe birds.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I wish to express sincere thanks for quarters provided our\r\nfield party at the Campo Experimental Forestal \"El Tormento\" at\r\nEscarcega, Campeche, by Ing. Hector Flores S.; at Pueblo Nuevo X-can,\r\nQuintana Roo, by Pablo Alimilla; at Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana\r\nRoo, by Fernando Esquival Montono; and at Piste, Yucatan, by Luis V.\r\nPolanco. The field party benefited also from arrangements and helpful\r\nsuggestions made by Eduardo C. Welling of Merida and Marynoll Father\r\nJoseph Early of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Wherever we camped the local\r\nMayans were exceptionally helpful, especially as guides and collectors.\r\n\r\nOur field party was composed of two units. One unit, working on a\r\nsurvey of Middle American vertebrates and their ectoparasites, was\r\nsupported by the United States Army Medical Research and Development\r\nCommand (Contract No. DA-49-193-MD-2215). The second unit, composed of\r\nstudents in the Field Course in Vertebrate Zoology from The University\r\nof Kansas, was supported in part by the Museum of Natural History and\r\nby a grant from the National Science Foundation (G 20939, Special\r\nProjects in Science Education). The late Ing. Luis Macias Arellano,\r\nDepartamento de la Fauna Silvestre, Direccion General de Caza, Mexico,\r\nD.F., generously provided the necessary permits for collecting\r\nvertebrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yucatan Peninsula is a northeastern projection of Central America\r\nlying between the Gulf of Campeche, the Gulf of Mexico, and the\r\nCaribbean Sea. Its area is approximately 143,500 square kilometers and\r\nincludes the Mexican states of Campeche and Yucatan and the sparsely\r\nsettled Territory of Quintana Roo, plus parts of British Honduras and\r\nthe Peten region of Guatamala. The peninsula has a mean breadth of\r\nabout 300 kilometers and a coast line of about 1100 kilometers.\r\n\r\nTopographically, the peninsula is a low-level plain that rises\r\ngradually inland to the south. The coast on the north and west is low,\r\nsandy, and semi-barren; openings through the outer coastal strand lead\r\nto narrow brackish lagoons surrounded by mangroves. The eastern coast\r\nconsists of bluffs, indented with bays and bordered by several islands,\r\nthe largest being Cozumel. A small range of hills traverses the\r\npeninsula from the city of Campeche to Chetumal Bay; although appearing\r\nsizeable, these almost nowhere exceed 100 meters in elevation. The\r\nextreme southerly portion of the peninsula is moderately hilly and is\r\ncovered with tropical rain forest.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula is composed almost wholly of a bed of coraline and porous\r\nlimestone covered with a layer of thin, dry soil formed from the slow\r\nweathering of the bedrock. The humus is rarely more than a few\r\ncentimeters deep, and consequently cornfields (_milpas_) must be moved\r\nevery two or three years. With each move a new area of the land is\r\ncleared and burned. This agricultural practice has been routine with\r\nthe Mayan people for centuries and apparently has had a profound effect\r\non the vegetation, severely limiting the extent of virgin forest.\r\n\r\nIn many places, especially in the northern part of the peninsula, the\r\nrocky surface of the terrain is perforated by natural wells or\r\nsink-holes, which are called _cenotes_ locally. Many _cenotes_ support\r\nsmall \"islands\" of unique vegetation, the composition of which somewhat\r\nresembles the rain forest of the southern part of the peninsula.\r\nTemporary water-holes and shallow lakes (_aguadas_) are sparsely\r\nscattered throughout the southern half of the peninsula. There are no\r\nrivers of importance; most that are present are in the southernmost\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nThe climate of northern Yucatan is hot and dry, and the absence of high\r\nmountainous ridges to intercept the moisture-bearing clouds from the\r\nAtlantic accounts for less rain than would be expected. The\r\nsouthernmost part of the peninsula receives a maximum of 200\r\ncentimeters of rain annually. The amount decreases toward the north to\r\nan average of about 45 centimeters. Almost all of the rain falls from\r\nMay to October. Daily temperatures range from 78 deg. to 98 deg. F. in the\r\nshade; cool sea winds prevail day and night throughout most of the\r\nyear. The hottest months are May and June. In winter, fierce northers,\r\n_temporales_ or _nortes_, occasionally sweep across this open region,\r\nbringing rain and cooler temperatures, lasting several days.\r\n\r\nThe areas adjacent to British Honduras and Guatemala receive sufficient\r\nrainfall to support forests containing mahogany (_Swietenia_);\r\nsapodilly (_Achras_); several valuable cabinet woods; logwood\r\n(_Haematozylon_) and other dyewoods. As one proceeds northward the\r\nflora and fauna change gradually from that of the wet tropics to that\r\nof the dry tropics.\r\n\r\nPaynter's (1955a) system of vegetational zones on the peninsula is\r\nuseful to ornithologists. He recognized three zones: Scrub, Deciduous\r\nForest, and Rain Forest. The Scrub zone occupies Isla Holbox and Isla\r\nMujeres and the arid northern coast of Yucatan. The zone extends only a\r\nfew miles inland and consists of low-tropical thorn forest of mesquite\r\n(_Prosopsis_), _Mimosa_, _Yucca_, _Agave_, and mangrove (_Rhizophora_)\r\nwherever standing water occurs. Sisal in Yucatan and Isla Mujeres of\r\nQuintana Roo are in this Scrub zone.\r\n\r\nThe Deciduous Forest zone is a vast area of low, semiarid, secondary\r\nforest occupying all of the state of Yucatan not in the Scrub zone,\r\nnorthern Campeche, and a thin strip a few kilometers wide in Quintana\r\nRoo along the Yucatan-Quintana Roo border and a similar narrow band\r\nalong the eastern coast. The island of Cozumel is also included in this\r\nzone. Collections were made in the Deciduous Forest at Champoton,\r\nCampeche, Isla Cozumel and Puerto Juarez, Quintana Roo, and Piste,\r\nYucatan.\r\n\r\nThe Rain Forest zone occupies the remainder of the peninsula and\r\nincludes most of the territory of Quintana Roo, and the southern half\r\nof Campeche. Collections were made in this zone at Escarcega, Campeche,\r\nand at Felipe Carrillo Puerto and Pueblo Nuevo X-can, Quintana Roo.\r\nIsla del Carmen cannot be accurately assigned to any of these three\r\nzones because most of the island has been planted in coconut palms. It\r\nis an area of high rainfall and may once have supported rainforest.\r\n\r\nIn the present report the term \"second growth\" refers to areas that\r\nhave been recently cut over. In these areas, the forest is\r\ncharacteristically low and in a stage of transition. In the Rain Forest\r\nzone \"second growth\" areas usually contain species of deciduous trees.\r\n\r\nPaynter (1955a) has given an excellent descriptive summary of the\r\ntopography, climate, and phytogeography of the Yucatan Peninsula and\r\nthere is little need to go into further detail here. During summer, the\r\nrainy season, the Deciduous Forest is much more luxuriant in appearance\r\nthan in winter when most of the trees have lost their leaves. Also, the\r\nnumerous _cenotes_ in this zone support a limited growth of evergreen\r\ntrees. For example, the large Cenote Seco about two kilometers east of\r\nChichen-Itza contains elephant ear (_Caladium_), mamey (_Mammea_), figs\r\n(_Ficus_), and other large trees the trunks of which are some 10 meters\r\nbelow the surface of the surrounding tableland. These plants project\r\nfive to 10 meters above the surrounding low forest. The floor of this\r\n_cenote_ is near the watertable but not below it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAZETTEER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe specimens of birds reported herein were collected at the localities\r\nshown on the accompanying map (Fig. 1). These localities are listed\r\nbelow in alphabetical order according to states.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Campeche\r\n\r\n    Champoton.--Lat. 19 deg. 21' N, long. 90 deg. 43' W, sea level to five\r\n    meters. A fishing village on the Gulf of Mexico. Collections were\r\n    made principally at our camp five kilometers south of the town. Low\r\n    deciduous forest, second growth, and _milpas_.\r\n\r\n    Escarcega.--Lat. 18 deg. 37' N, long. 90 deg. 44' W, elevation 65 meters. A\r\n    village in southwestern Campeche.

A village in east-central Quintana Roo. Field work was\r\n    centered at Rancho San Miguel, about four kilometers north-northeast\r\n    of the village. Mostly second growth rainforest with scattered\r\n    large patches of tall trees (to 30 meters). Several large _milpas_\r\n    were present on the ranch some of which had been recently cleared.\r\n    Our camp was at a large aguada bordered on one side by an extensive\r\n    marsh with tall dense grass.\r\n\r\n    Isla Cozumel.--Lat. 20 deg. 27' N, long. 86 deg. 26' W, sea level to 10\r\n    meters. A large island, 15 kilometers east of the mainland.\r\n    Collections were made on the northwestern part of the island from\r\n    one to five kilometers north-northeast of the village of San Miguel\r\n    in low, dense deciduous forest.\r\n\r\n    Isla Mujeres.--Lat. 21 deg. 12' N, long. 86 deg. 43' W, sea level to 30\r\n    meters. A small, narrow island about eight kilometers from the\r\n    coast at the northeastern end of the peninsula. Field work was done\r\n    on the beach at the northern end of the island, in low deciduous\r\n    forest in the middle of the island, and in low deciduous forest and\r\n    cactus (_Opuntia_) association on a high rocky bluff on the\r\n    southern end of the island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. A map of the Yucatan Peninsula of\r\nMexico showing localities referred to in the text.]\r\n\r\n    Pueblo Nuevo X-can.--Lat. 21 deg. 52' N, long. 87 deg. 26' W, elevation 10\r\n    meters. A village five kilometers east of X-can, Yucatan, in\r\n    rainforest with dense underbrush. Specimens were obtained from the\r\n    immediate vicinity of the village.\r\n\r\n    Puerto Juarez.--Lat. 21 deg. 10' N, long. 86 deg. 49' W, sea level. A small\r\n    port on the Caribbean Coast with alternating sand beach and\r\n    limestone shore. Mangrove swamps extend a short distance inland at\r\n    various points. Specimens were collected in rainforestlike\r\n    vegetation at a small _cenote_, in low deciduous forest, and at our\r\n    camp along a large, cleared airstrip four kilometers west-southwest\r\n    of the village.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yucatan\r\n\r\n    Piste.--Lat. 20 deg. 42' N, long. 88 deg. 28' W, elevation 10 meters. A\r\n    village in dense, low deciduous forest with many nearby _milpas_.\r\n    Collections were made in a wide area in the vicinity of the\r\n    village, including nearby Chichen-Itza.\r\n\r\n    Sisal.--Lat. 21 deg. 10' N, long. 90 deg. 00' W, sea level. A small village\r\n    on the north-western coast of the peninsula. Collections were made\r\n    on the beach, in the low scrub vegetation behind the beach, and in\r\n    the mangrove swamps and nearly-dry lagoons further inland, from\r\n    three to 13 kilometers west-southwest of the village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalogue numbers in the following accounts are those of the Museum of\r\nNatural History, The University of Kansas. With the exception of a\r\nsynoptic collection presented to the Departamento de la Fauna\r\nSilvestre, Direccion General de Caza, Mexico, D.F., all of the\r\nspecimens mentioned are in the museum at the University of Kansas.\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise indicated, specimens taken were not molting. For birds\r\nundergoing postnuptial or postjuvenal molt, the degree of advancement\r\nof the molt is indicated by the numbers of primaries and rectrices that\r\nare new or partly ensheathed. Information on the condition of the\r\ntestes refers to the left testis unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\nScientific and vernacular names follow Friedmann _et al._ (1950) and\r\nMiller _et al._ (1957) except for specimens of species or genera that\r\nhave been more thoroughly treated systematically since the publication\r\nof the Mexican Checklist, for example, _Columbina_, _Centurus_ and\r\n_Platypsaris_, by Johnston (1962), Selander and Giller (1963), and\r\nWebster (1963), respectively. The trinomial is used whenever\r\nsubspecific identities could be made with a reasonable degree of\r\ncertainty. The specimens of several kinds were in extremely worn\r\nplumage or in molt and meaningful judgments concerning such characters\r\nas relative darkness or paleness of plumages could not be made.\r\n\r\nSpecimens are listed in each account according to the temporal order in\r\nwhich they were collected.\r\n\r\n_Bulbulcus ibis_ Linnaeus: Cattle Egret.--Our specimen is one of three\r\nindividuals seen feeding near cattle at Rancho San Miguel on August 13\r\nand 14.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40401, testis 6 x 2 mm., 289.5 gm. (August\r\n    14), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Casmerodius albus_ (Linnaeus): American Egret.--We took one egret from\r\na flock of about 20 that flew low over our campsite on the morning of\r\nJuly 12.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Female], 40402, ovary inactive, 10 x 5 mm., 607.5\r\n    gm. (July 12), 5 km. S Champoton. Mallophaga: _Ciconiphilus\r\n    obscurus._\r\n\r\n_Cochlearius cochlearius_ (Linnaeus): Boat-billed Heron.--Three\r\nindividuals were seen on a small point of land immediately south of the\r\nvillage on the west coast of Isla Mujeres on the afternoon of August 1.\r\nOne was foraging in a small cove about one mile south of the village on\r\nthe morning of August 2. Paynter (1955a) did not list the species for\r\nIsla Mujeres; our observations seem to constitute the first records for\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n_Mycteria americana_ Linnaeus: Wood Ibis.--A flock of about 15 flew\r\nover our camp 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto on August 14.\r\n\r\n_Sarcoramphus papa_ (Linnaeus): King Vulture.--Our specimen was one of\r\ntwo individuals seen at a cenote.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male] 40403, testes inactive, 8 lbs. (July 29), 1\r\n    km. N Pueblo Nuevo X-can. Mallophaga: _Colpocephalum megalops_.\r\n\r\n_Carthartes burrovianus_ Cassin: Yellow-headed Vulture.--We saw several\r\nYellow-headed Vultures on Isla del Carmen on July 6, 7, 8, and 9. _C.\r\nburrovianus_ was more abundant than either _Carthartes aura_ or\r\n_Coragyps atratus_ in the vicinity of Champoton, where we confirmed\r\nfield identifications by taking a specimen. Until Wetmore (1950)\r\nclarified the status of _C. burrovianus_ in southern Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica, the species had gone unnoticed or misidentified as _C. aura_.\r\nThe Mexican Checklist (Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore, 1950) omitted _C.\r\nburrovianus_ from the avifauna of Mexico. Blake (1953) included\r\nTabasco, Chiapas, and Veracruz within the range of the species, but\r\nPaynter (1955a) omitted it from his list of birds of the Yucatan\r\nPeninsula. Our specimen seemingly constitutes the first record from the\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40404, testes inactive, 1-3/4 lb. (July 9), 2\r\n    km. S Champoton.\r\n\r\n_Chondrohierax uncinatus uncinatus_ (Temminck): Hook-billed Kite.--A\r\npair was seen 5 km. S Champoton on July 8 and 9. Both birds were in\r\nadult plumage and appeared to be mated, although we found no nest. The\r\nmale is referable to _C. u. uncinatus_ on the basis of the narrow white\r\nventral bands, most of which are 0.3 millimeter or less in width. None\r\nof the bars exceeds 0.5 millimeter in width. Paynter (1955a) discussed\r\nin detail the contradictions in the literature concerning the\r\ngeographic range of this subspecies, and referred a male in his\r\ncollection taken in February, 1952, to _C. u. aliquonis_. Traylor\r\n(1941) collected a large series of this species in Yucatan and Campeche\r\nin winter and allocated the specimens to the nominate form.\r\n\r\nAt Piste, on July 23, a nestling approximately half-grown was brought\r\nin by a local boy. The rectrices were partly ensheathed and the feather\r\ncount extensively downy.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Male], 40406, testis 9 x 5 mm., 215.0 gm. (July\r\n    10), 5 km. S Champoton; [Male], 40405, nestling, 117.6 gm. (July\r\n    24), Piste.\r\n\r\n_Buteo magnirostris gracilis_ (Ridgway): Roadside Hawk.--This was the\r\nonly hawk seen on Isla Cozumel.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Male], 40411, testis 5 mm., 207.3 gm. (August 10),\r\n    4 km. N San Miguel; [Female], 40412, 242 gm. (August 10), 3-1/2 km.\r\n    N San Miguel.\r\n\r\n_Buteo magnirostris conspectus_ (Peters): Roadside Hawk.--This species\r\nwas the commonest hawk on the peninsula and was seen at all localities\r\nexcept Isla Mujeres and Sisal.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40409 (July 12), and [Female], 40410, ova to\r\n    1 mm., 249 gm. (July 16), 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega; [Male], 40413, 279\r\n    gm. (July 17) 1 km. N, 13 km. W Escarcega; [Male], 40407, testis 5\r\n    x 2 mm., 254.7 gm. (July 23), Piste: [Female], 40408, ovary\r\n    inactive, 279.0 gm. (July 28), Pueblo Nuevo X-can.\r\n\r\n_Buteo brachyurus_ Vieillot: Short-tailed Hawk.--Our one specimen, a\r\nmale (40414) weighing 342 gm. and in white-bellied phase, was taken by\r\na native 6 km. W Escarcega on July 14. The testes were inactive.\r\n\r\n_Buteo nitidus plagiatus_ (Schlegel): Gray Hawk.--Our specimen is one\r\nof two subadults sighted near a large milpas, on Rancho San Miguel.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40415, testis 5 x 3 mm., 364 gm. (August 15),\r\n    4 km. NNE Felipe Carillo Puerto. Mallophaga: _Craspedorrhy_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Buteogallus anthracinus_ (Lichtenstein): Common Black Hawk.--Five\r\nindividuals were seen on August 23 along a stretch of five miles of\r\nhighway about 30 mi. SW Champoton, Campeche. The species was identified\r\nfrom the description given in Blake (1953). The hawks were perched on\r\ndead limbs in full view, 50 to 100 feet from the highway, which at this\r\nlocality parallels the beach, sometimes only a few yards from the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Ortalis vetula intermedia_ Peters: Chachalaca.--Chachalacas were heard\r\nor seen at all localities on the mainland except Sisal.\r\n\r\nSpecimens (3): [Female], 40416, 423 gm. (July 13), [Female], 40417, 432\r\ngm. (July 15), and [Female], 40418, ovary 12 x 9 mm., 408.5 gm. (July\r\n16), 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega. Mallophaga: _Amyrisidea spicula_, July 16.\r\n\r\n_Colinus nigrogularis persiccus_ Van Tyne and Trautman: Black-throated\r\nQuail.--These quail were abundant in the arid scrub west of Sisal.\r\nSeveral coveys of half-grown chicks were seen and specimens taken were\r\nin full breeding condition. On a two-mile walk on August 18, in the\r\ncoastal scrub about 5 km. W Sisal, a pair of quail was seen about every\r\n100 paces.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (4): [Female], 40422, ovum in oviduct 30 x 22 mm., 147.5\r\n    gm. (August 10), [Female], 40420, ovum in oviduct 27 mm., 151.7 gm.\r\n    (August 18), [Male], 40421, testis 9 x 5 mm., 119.6 gm. (August\r\n    18), and [Male], 40419, testis 11 x 6 mm., 145.7 gm. (August 18),\r\n    all from southwest of Sisal.\r\n\r\n_Laterallus ruber_ (Sclater and Salvin): Little Red Rail.--Two\r\nspecimens were taken about 3-1/2 km. N San Miguel, Isla Cozumel, in\r\ntall grass. One bird was shot when flushed; the other was caught in a\r\nMuseum Special mousetrap. I follow Brodkorb (1943) and Paynter (1955a)\r\nwho did not recognize subspecies in this species.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Female], 40424, ovary 9 x 3 mm., 41.5 gm. (August\r\n    8), and [Male], 40423, testis 6 mm., 40.0 gm. (August 11), Isla\r\n    Cozumel.\r\n\r\n_Porphyrula nartinica_ (Linnaeus): Purple Gallinule.--A female was\r\ntaken in the tall grass where red rails were found on Isla Cozumel.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Female], 4025, ovary 14 x 7 mm., 169 gm. (August\r\n    10), 3-1/2 km. N San Miguel.\r\n\r\n_Haematopus ostralegus_ Linnaeus: Oyster-catcher.--Two individuals were\r\nseen along the beach about 6 km. W Sisal on August 10 and 11.\r\n\r\n_Charadrius alexandrinus tenuirostris_ (Lawrence): Snowy Plover.--This\r\nwas one of the commonest shorebirds on the beaches and mudflats west of\r\nSisal. Several immature birds were taken, along with a pair of\r\nhalf-grown chicks, indicating the species was breeding, or recently had\r\nbred, there. No previous record of this species breeding on the\r\npeninsula has been found.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (6): [Female], 40431, ovary inactive, 38.2 gm. (August\r\n    7), 4 mi. S Sisal; [Male], 40426 testis minute, 35.4 gm. (August\r\n    9), [Female], 40427, half-grown chick, 25.4 gm. (August 9), [Male],\r\n    40428, half-grown chick, 21.2 gm. (August 9), [Female], 40430,\r\n    imm., 38.0 gm., little fat (August 10), [Female], 40429, ovary\r\n    inactive, 35.7 gm., little fat, molting--1st through 6th primaries\r\n    and middle pair of rectrices are new (August 10), all from 13 km.\r\n    WSW Sisal. Mallophaga: _Actornithophilus ochraceus_, August 9;\r\n    _Quadraceps assimilis major_, August 7.\r\n\r\n_Charadrius wilsonia wilsonia_ Ord: Wilson Plover.--A flock of about 11\r\nwas seen on the beach north of the village on Isla Mujeres on August 1.\r\nTwo specimens were collected on the leeward side of the island about\r\nthree kilometers south of the village on August 2. The only evidence of\r\nbreeding was slightly enlarged testes in one male. Two individuals were\r\nsighted on the east coast of the mainland at Puerto Juarez on August 4.\r\nThe species was common 3 to 13 km. west-southwest of Sisal; specimens\r\ntaken there may have been migrants.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40435, testis 3 x 1 mm., 59.0 gm. (August\r\n    2), and [Female], 40436, ovary inactive, 49.3 gm. (August 2), Isla\r\n    Mujeres; [Female], 40434, ovary inactive, 53.6 gm. (August 7),\r\n    [Male], 40433, testis 1 mm., 54.5 gm.

WSW Sisal.\r\n    Mallophaga: _Quadraceps assimilis major_, August 2 and August 11.\r\n\r\n_Actitis macularia_ (Linnaeus): Spotted Sandpiper.--A total of six\r\nindividuals was seen on Isla Mujeres; each was alone. The species was\r\ncommon at Sisal where it was often seen in small mixed flocks with\r\nSnowy Plovers and Wilson Plovers.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (3): [Male], 40437, testis 2 x 1 mm., 33.8 gm. (August\r\n    9), [Male], 40438, imm., 28.2 gm. (August 10), and sex? 40439,\r\n    imm., 31.0 gm. (August 10), 13 km. WSW Sisal. Mallophaga:\r\n    _Quadraceps ravus_; August 10.\r\n\r\n_Catoptrophorus semipalmatus inornatus_ (Brewster): Willet.--A flock of\r\n15 or 20 individuals was seen almost every day of our stay on the beach\r\n8-13 km. WSW of Sisal. Measurements of two of the specimens are large\r\nand they are clearly referable to _C. s. inornatus_.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (3): [Male], 40441, testis 3 mm., 242.3 gm., wing 205\r\n    mm., tail 80 mm., tarsus 66 mm., culmen (from feathers) 60 mm.\r\n    (August 9), [Female], 40440, ovary inactive, 240.5 gm., wing 204\r\n    mm., tail 77 mm., tarsus 69 mm., culmen (from feathers) 59 mm.\r\n    (August 11), and [Male], 40442, imm., 221.1 gm. (August 11) 8-13\r\n    km. WSW Sisal. Mallophaga: _Austrominopon sachlebeni_, August 9;\r\n    _Quadraceps carrikeri_, August 11.\r\n\r\n_Arenaria interpres_ (Linnaeus): Turnstone.--Six individuals were\r\nsighted on Isla Mujeres on August 1 and one individual was sighted 4\r\nkm. W Sisal on August 11.\r\n\r\n_Crocethia alba_ (Pallas): Sanderling.--This species was relatively\r\ncommon at Sisal where several flocks of 30 to 40 birds were seen. One\r\nspecimen (40444) shows an unusual pattern of molt; replacement of outer\r\nprimaries has preceded that of the inner.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (4): [Male], 40445, testis 3 x 1 mm., 57.5 gm., heavy fat\r\n    (August 9), [Female], 40444, ovary granular 6 x 3 mm., 56.7 gm.,\r\n    molting (August 11), [Male], 40443, 35.5 gm. (August 11), and\r\n    [Female], 40446, imm., 54.1 gm. (August 11), 6-1/2-13 km. WSW\r\n    Sisal. Mallophaga: _Lunaceps holophaeus actophilus_, August 11;\r\n    _Carduiceps zonarius_, August 11.\r\n\r\n_Ereunetes pusillus_ (Linnaeus): Semipalmated Sandpiper.--The only\r\nindividual seen was taken from a mixed flock of Sanderlings and Wilson\r\nPlovers.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40447, testis minute, 24.4 gm. (August 11), 8\r\n    km. WSW Sisal.\r\n\r\n_Himantopus mexicanus_ (Mueller): Black-necked Stilt.--A lone individual\r\nwas sighted on Isla Mujeres on August 2. A pair was on the mudflats\r\namong mangroves at Sisal, of which the male was taken on August 7.\r\nAlthough Paynter (1955a) indicated that this species probably breeds on\r\nthe peninsula, there are no definite breeding records. Our specimen had\r\nonly slightly enlarged testes, but its close association with a female\r\nsuggested that the pair may have been mated.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40448, testis 7 x 3 mm., 189.4 gm., little\r\n    fat (August 7), 5 mi. SW Sisal.\r\n\r\n_Larus atricilla_ Linnaeus: Laughing Gull.--This species was seen\r\nregularly along the coasts of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Female], 40449, ovary 7 mm. (inactive), 253 gm.\r\n    (August 7), 4-3/10 mi. W Sisal. Mallophaga: _Quadraceps_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Sterna albifrons antillarum_ (Lesson): Least Tern.--A flock of about\r\n20 individuals was seen on Isla Mujeres; two individuals were shot and\r\nappear to be the first specimens from the island.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Female], 40451, ovary slightly enlarged, 49.0 gm.\r\n    (August 2); sex? 40450, 41.8 gm. (August 2), Isla Mujeres.\r\n\r\n_Thalasseus sandvicensis_ (Latham): Cabot Tern.--Lone individuals were\r\nseen several times flying along the coast southwest of Sisal.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40452, 186 gm. (August 11), 13 km. WSW Sisal.\r\n    Mallophaga: _Saemundssonia brevicernis_.\r\n\r\n_Patagioenas flavirostris flavirostris_ (Wagler): Red-billed Pigeon.--This\r\nspecies was seen at all stations except on the islands and in the arid\r\nscrub at Sisal. It was especially abundant at Escarcega, Felipe\r\nCarrillo Puerto, and Puerto Juarez. The male in breeding condition\r\nsuggests that the breeding season extends into the summer.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Female], 40455, ovary inactive (July 13), [Female],\r\n    40456, ovary inactive, (July 13), and [Male], 40457, testis 7 x 5\r\n    mm. (July 15), 6-{7-1/2} km. W Escarcega; [Male], 40453, testis 15\r\n    x 6 mm., 225.5 gm. (August 16), and [Female], 40454, ovary\r\n    inactive, 228 gm. (August 16), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n    Mallophaga: _Columbicola_ sp., July 15.\r\n\r\n_Zenaida aurita yucatanensis_ Salvadori: Zenaida Dove.--This species\r\nwas common at Sisal.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (3): [Female], 40459, imm., 136.5 gm., little fat (August\r\n    11), 8 km. SW Sisal; [Female], 40399, 151.2 gm. (August 7), 1-1/2\r\n    mi. S Sisal; [Female], 40400, 163.3 gm. (August 18), 2 km. WSW\r\n    Sisal. Mallophaga: _Columbicola macrouras_, August 7.\r\n\r\n_Zenaida asiatica_ Linnaeus: White-winged Dove.--Birds of this species\r\nwere ubiquitous in the scrub west of Sisal between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.\r\nbut inconspicuous at other times. Apparently the birds were from nests,\r\nroosts, and watering sites in the taller forest inland.\r\n\r\n_Columbina passerina pallescens_ (Baird): Common Ground Dove.--This\r\nspecies was common at almost all collecting localities, but was always\r\noutnumbered by the Ruddy Ground Dove. The species was not seen in the\r\nvicinity of Escarcega, probably because of the tall forest and lack of\r\nclearings there.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40461, testis 10 x 5 mm., 40.9 gm. (August\r\n    10), 2 km. WSW Sisal; [Male], 40460, testis 6 x 3 mm. (August 9),\r\n    and [Female], 40464, ova to 4 mm., 37 gm. (August 9), {3-1/2}-4 km.\r\n    N San Miguel, Isla Cozumel; [Female], 40463, imm., molting, 35.5\r\n    gm. (August 15), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Columbina talpacoti rufipennis_ (Bonaparte): Ruddy Ground Dove.--This\r\ndove was common at all localities visited. All specimens were in\r\nbreeding condition.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (9): [Female], 40472, ova to 3 mm., 45.4 gm. (July 8),\r\n    [Male], 40468, testis 10 x 5 mm., 50.0 gm (July 8), [Male], 40469,\r\n    testis 10 x 5 mm., 65.5 gm. (July 8), [Female], 40470, ova to 3\r\n    mm., 51.6 gm. (July 8) and [Male], 40471, testis 9 x 5 mm., 57.5\r\n    gm. (July 8), all from the vicinity of Puerto Real Isla del Carmen;\r\n    [Female], 40467, 57.7 gm., (July 10), 5 km. S Chapoton; [Male],\r\n    40473, testis 8 x 5 mm., 53.0 gm. (July 17), 1 km. N, 13 km. W\r\n    Escarcega; [Female], 40465, ova to 21 mm., 51.8 gm. (July 28);\r\n    Pueblo Nuevo X-can; [Male], 40466, testis 8 x 4 mm., 46.6 gm.\r\n    (August 16), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Claravis pretiosa_ (Ferrari-Perez): Blue Ground Dove.--This species\r\nwas seen only at Pueblo Nuevo X-can where a breeding pair was taken on\r\nJuly 29; this record extends the known breeding season by one month\r\n(see Paynter, 1955b).\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Male], 40475, testis 10 x 5 mm., 65.0 gm. (July\r\n    29), and [Female], 40474, ova to 9 mm., 68.3 gm. (July 29), Pueblo\r\n    Nuevo X-can.\r\n\r\n_Leptotila verreauxi fulviventris_ Lawrence: White-fronted Dove.--My\r\nonly records of this species are the two specimens listed below. Both\r\nbirds had slightly enlarged ovaries and the one from west of Escarcega\r\nwas molting. Paynter (1955a) recorded breeding from late January to\r\nlate April.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Female], 40476, ova to 2 mm., molting--5th and 6th\r\n    primaries ensheathed (July 14), 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega; [Female],\r\n    40477, ovary 12 x 5 mm., 162 gm. (August 14), 4 km. NNE Felipe\r\n    Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Leptotila jamaicencis gaumeri_ (Lawrence): Caribbean Dove.--Two were\r\ncollected on Isla Cozumel and the several white-fronted doves seen on\r\nIsla Mujeres probably were of this species.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Male], 40478, testis 9 x 5 mm., 175 gm.,\r\n    molting--4th primaries ensheathed (August 9), and [Female], 40479,\r\n    imm., 116.7 gm., molting--2nd primaries ensheathed (August 10),\r\n    3-1/2 km. N San Miguel.\r\n\r\n_Oreopeleia montana montana_ (Linnaeus): Ruddy Quail-dove.--My only\r\nrecord is of a male, in full breeding condition, which extends the\r\nknown breeding period almost two months.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40480, testis 19 x 8 mm., 144.7 gm. (July\r\n    29), Pueblo Nuevo X-can.\r\n\r\n_Artinga astec astec_ (Souance): Aztec Parakeet.--This species was most\r\ncommon in deciduous forest and scrub at Champoton, Piste, Puerto\r\nJuarez, and especially Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Parakeets were extremely\r\nwary and only two were collected.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Male], 40481, testis 3 x 2 mm., 75.0 gm.,\r\n    molting--extensive body molt, 8th primaries ensheathed, middle pair\r\n    of rectrices are new (August 16), and [Female], 40482, ovary\r\n    inactive, 72.4 gm. (August 16), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Amazona xantholora_ (Gray): Yellow-lored Parrot.--The species was\r\nabundant in the vicinity of Champoton. Large flocks congregated near\r\ncamp; the birds began to assemble about an hour before dark. One was\r\nshot from a flock that flew over our camp and another was taken at\r\nnight from its roost in a small tree about 10 feet above a trail. One\r\nsmall flock of _Amazona_ was seen 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto. All\r\nspecimens were molting.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (3): [Male], 40483, testis 5 x 2 mm., 229.1 gm.,\r\n    molting--extensive body molt, 6th primaries ensheathed (July 9),\r\n    and [Female], 40484, ovary 13 x 9 mm. (inactive), 209.0 gm.,\r\n    molting--extensive body molt, wing molt complete (July 11), 5 km. S\r\n    Champoton; [Male], 40485, testis 5 x 2 mm., 210.9 gm.,\r\n    molting--extensive body molt, 7th primaries ensheathed (August 16),\r\n    4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Amazona albifrons nana_ Miller: White-fronted Parrot.--This species\r\nwas common west of Escarcega where large flocks were seen every\r\nevening. A specimen of _A. albifrons_ was taken south of Champoton\r\nwhere this species occurred in large flocks with _A. xantholora_. One\r\nspecimen was taken from a small flock near Chichen-Itza.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40487, testis 8 x 4 mm., 210.0 gm. (July\r\n    10), 5 km. S. Champoton; [Female], 40488, ovary inactive, 205.5\r\n    gm., molting (July 12), [Male], 40489, 232.5 gm., molting (July\r\n    13), and [Female], 40490, ovary inactive, 206.1 gm. (July 14),\r\n    7-1/2 km. W Escarcega; [Female], 40486, ovary inactive, 176.0 gm.\r\n    (July 27), 2 km. E Chichen-Itza.\r\n\r\n_Coccyzus americanus americanus_ (Linnaeus): Yellow-billed Cuckoo.--A\r\nfemale taken at Piste substantiates Paynter's (1955a) suggestion that\r\nthe species breeds on the peninsula.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Female], 40491, ovary 12 x 9 mm., 58.7 gm.,\r\n    well-developed brood patch (July 22), Piste.\r\n\r\n_Coccyzus minor_ (Gmelin): Mangrove Cuckoo.--In view of the paucity of\r\nrecent records of this species from the mainland of the peninsula, it\r\nis noteworthy that several individuals were seen flying to and from the\r\nbeach and mangroves late one evening about 4 km. W Sisal.\r\n\r\n_Piaya cayana thermophila_ Sclater: Squirrel Cuckoo.--This species was\r\nseen at our camps near Champoton, Piste, Pueblo Nuevo X-can, and Puerto\r\nJuarez. The slightly enlarged (probably regressing) testes of males\r\nexamined seem to be the only evidence of breeding activity in the\r\nspecies on the peninsula.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (3): [Male], 40493, testis 8 x 6 mm., 99.6 gm. (July 14),\r\n    and [Female], 40494, 90.0 gm. (July 14), 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega;\r\n    [Male], 40492, testis 5 x 2 mm., 97.5 gm., molting (August 14), 4\r\n    km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Crotophaga sulcirostris sulcirostris_ Swainson: Grove-billed\r\nAni.--Three half-grown juveniles were taken at Piste and a pair in\r\nbreeding condition was taken at Pueblo Nuevo X-can. These seem to be\r\nthe first breeding records from the peninsula.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40495, juv., 39.9 gm. (July 21), [Male],\r\n    40496, juv., 39.5 gm. (July 21), and [Female], 40497, juv., 30.0\r\n    gm. (July 21), Piste; [Male], 40498, testis 11 x 4 mm., 72.2 gm.\r\n    (July 28), and [Female], 40499, ova to 7 mm., 70.0 gm. (July 28),\r\n    Pueblo Nuevo X-can.\r\n\r\n_Crotophaga ani_ Linnaeus: Smooth-billed Ani.--The female taken on Isla\r\nCozumel had a slightly enlarged ovary and had been banded (USFWS band\r\nno. 524-96303) on the island in 1961 as an adult.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Female], 40500, ovary 11 x 7 mm., 86 gm., molting\r\n    (August 4), 3-1/2 km. N San Miguel.\r\n\r\n_Glaucidium brasilianum ridgwayi_ Sharpe: Streaked Pygmy Owl.--A female\r\n(40501) was taken by a local boy at Pueblo Nuevo X-can on July 29\r\nweighed 62 gm. and the ovary (7 x 3 mm.) was inactive.\r\n\r\n_Ciccaba virgata centralis_ Griscom: Squamulated Owl.--Our only\r\nspecimen, a female (40502) weighing 288.7 gm. and having an inactive\r\novary (13 x 4 mm.), was taken at night on July 16 from a mist net\r\nstretched across a small trail 1 km. N, 13 km. W Escarcega.\r\n\r\n_Nyctibius griseus mexicanus_ Nelson: Mexican Potoo.--One specimen was\r\ntaken at night 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega where it was found sitting on the\r\nlimb of a large dead tree. A light but steady rain was falling at the\r\ntime. On the night of August 16 along a stretch of newly-constructed\r\nroad 4-16 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto, 27 potoos were seen, their\r\nlarge and brilliant, amber-colored eyes first appearing in the\r\nheadlights several hundred yards ahead of our vehicle. All of the birds\r\nwere perched between 30 and 60 feet above the ground on dead limbs of\r\nlarge trees, and all were perched on the same side of the road facing\r\nthe light of a full moon. None was less than 200 meters from the next;\r\nfew flew at the approach of our vehicle. In addition to one specimen\r\ntaken along the road, another was taken from a fence post in a _milpa_\r\non the same night. It was approached close enough to be shot with a 22\r\ncaliber pistol loaded with dust-shot. All specimens had thick layers of\r\nsubcutaneous and visceral fat and their gonads were small and seemingly\r\ninactive.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (3): sex? 40505 (July 13) 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega;\r\n    [Female], 40504, ovary 13 x 4 mm. (inactive), 265 gm. (August 16),\r\n    and [Male], 40503, testis 5 x 3 mm., 320.5 gm. (August 16) 4 km.\r\n    NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Chordeiles acutipennis micromeris_ Oberholser: Trilling Nighthawk.--This\r\nspecies was common in the arid coastal scrub west of Sisal, where\r\nhundreds could be seen flying every evening. They were common also at\r\nPuerto Juarez, but uncommon at Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Male], 40506, testis 5 x 3 mm., 57.3 gm. (August\r\n    1), 5 km. WSW Puerto Juarez; [Female], 40507, ovary 4 x 3 mm.\r\n    (inactive), 37.0 gm. (August 16), km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Nyctidromus albicollis yucatanensis_ Nelson: Parauque.--This species\r\nwas especially common in the vicinity of Felipe Carrillo Puerto and on\r\nIsla Cozumel, and was seen at every collecting locality. A flightless,\r\njuvenal female was obtained by local boys at Piste on July 21.\r\nTherefore the reproduction period seems to be longer than Paynter's\r\n(1955a:141) data suggested.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40512, testis 7 x 3 mm., 75 gm. (July 10), 5\r\n    km. S Champoton; [Female], 40508, juv. (remiges and rectrices\r\n    ensheathed basally), 44.2 gm. (July 21), Piste; sex? 40510, 55.5\r\n    gm. (August 8), and [Male], 40509, testis 3 x 1 mm., 73.5 gm.,\r\n    molting--outermost two pairs of primaries ensheathed (August 10);\r\n    3-1/2 km. N San Miguel, Isla Cozumel; [Male], 40511, 72.9 gm.\r\n    (August 15), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Caprimulgus salvini badius_ (Bangs and Peck): Salvin's Whip-poor-will.--My\r\nonly record of this species is provided by a female (40513) taken 3-1/2\r\nkm. N San Miguel, Isla Cozumel, on August 8. The specimen weighed 58\r\ngrams, had an inactive ovary (6 x 4 mm.), and was molting (8th and 9th\r\nprimaries ensheathed).\r\n\r\n_Chateura vauxi gaumeri_ Lawrence: Vaux Swift.--This species was seen\r\nat almost every locality visited. The only specimens obtained were\r\nbrought in by a boy at Pueblo Nuevo X-can on July 30; he said he\r\ncaptured them in his house. Two of them were adults and four were\r\nfully-feathered young-of-the-year.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (6): [Male], 40516, testis 4 x 2 mm., [Female], 40519,\r\n    ovary inactive, [Male], 40514, juv., 12.6 gm., [Male], 40515, juv.,\r\n    [Female], 40517, juv., and [Female], 40518, juv. (July 30) Pueblo\r\n    Nuevo X-can.\r\n\r\n_Campylopterus curvipennis pampa_ (Lesson): Saber-wing.--A female\r\n(40522), shot 7-1/2, km. W Escarcega on July 16, seems to provide the\r\nfirst record of breeding (ovum 6 mm. in oviduct) by this species on the\r\npeninsula. A non-breeding female (40521) that weighed 5.0 gms. was\r\ntaken 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto on August 14.\r\n\r\n_Chlorostilbon canivetii canivetii_ (Lesson): Canivet Emerald.--This\r\nbird was seen at all localities at which we collected on the mainland.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (4): [Female], 40530, ovary moderately active, 3.0 gm.\r\n    (July 22), [Male], 40525, 2.1 gm. (July 23), and sex? 40526, 2.9\r\n    gm. (July 25), Piste; [Female], 40529, ovary inactive, 2.4 gm.\r\n    (July 26), 3-1/2 km. N Piste.\r\n\r\n_Chlorostilbon canivetii forificatus_ Ridgway: Canivet Emerald.--The\r\nspecimen is slightly larger than those taken on the mainland and is\r\nclearly referable to _C. c. forificatus_, a subspecies endemic to Isla\r\nCozumel.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Female], 40534, ovary inactive, 2.8 gm. (August 8),\r\n    3-1/2 km. N San Miguel, Isla Cozumel.\r\n\r\n_Amazilia candida candida_ (Bourcier and Mulsant): White-bellied\r\nEmerald.--This species seemed to be the commonest hummingbird at most\r\nlocalities on the mainland. However, it was not seen along the coasts.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40535, testis 3 mm., 2.9 gm. (July 12), and\r\n    [Male], 40536, testis 2 mm., 3.6 gm. (July 14), 7-1/2 km. W\r\n    Escarcega; [Male], 40531, testis 2 mm., 4.3 gm. (July 28), [Male],\r\n    40532, 3.8 gm. (July 28), and [Female], 40533, ovary inactive, 3.9\r\n    gm. (July 29), Pueblo Nuevo X-can.\r\n\r\n_Amazilia rutila_ (DeLattre): Cinnamomeous Hummingbird.--In addition to\r\nthe two localities from which specimens were taken, several individuals\r\nwere seen near the airstrip at Puerto Juarez.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (2): [Female], 40538, ovary inactive, 4.1 gm. (July 30),\r\n    1-1/2 km. S, 1 km. E Pueblo Nuevo X-can; [Male], 40539, testis 2\r\n    mm. (August 14), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Amazilia yucatanensis_ (Cabot): Yucatan Hummingbird.--Many of these\r\nhummingbirds were seen among the coco palms on Isla del Carmen. A\r\nfemale taken on August 14 with a moderately enlarged ovary may indicate\r\nthat the breeding season extends well into the summer.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (4): [Male], 40540, testis 2 mm., 4.7 gm. (July 7),\r\n    [Female], 40541, ovary inactive, 3.0 gm. (July 8), and [Male],\r\n    40543, 3.0 gm. (July 8); 1 km. SW Puerto Real, Isla del Carmen;\r\n    [Female], 40542, ovary 6 x 2 mm. (ova to 1 mm.), 2.9 gm. (August\r\n    14), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Trogon citreolus melanocephala_ Gould: Citreoline Trogon.--This\r\nspecies was heard or seen at all localities where deciduous forest was\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (7): [Female], 40557, ovary 14 x 8 mm. (ova to 2 mm.),\r\n    brood patch, 72.5 gm. (July 16), and [Male], 40558, 66.5 gm. (July\r\n    16), 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega; [Male], 40553, 74.0 gm. (August 1),\r\n    [Female], 40552, 74 gm. (August 1), [Female], 40554, ova to 3 mm.\r\n    (August 2), and [Male], 40555, 76.2 gm. (August 2), 4 km. WSW\r\n    Puerto Juarez; [Female], 40556, 76.4 gm. (August 15), 4 km. NNE\r\n    Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Chloroceryle americana septentrionalis_ (Sharpe): Green Kingfisher.--My\r\nonly specimen is a male (40559) shot near a large aguada at Rancho San\r\nMiguel, 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto on August 16. The specimen\r\nweighed 40.5 gm.\r\n\r\n_Ceryle torquata_ (Linnaeus): Ringed Kingfisher.--Paynter (1955a:154)\r\nnoted that this \"species has not been recorded from Yucatan but it is\r\nundoubtedly present, at least in the sheltered lagoon behind the\r\nbarrier bar.\" A single individual was seen in one of these lagoons on\r\nAugust 9 and 10.\r\n\r\n_Eumomota superciliosa superciliosa_ (Sandbach): Turquoise-browed\r\nMotmot.--On July 9 this species was nesting in a large \"colony\" 5 km. S\r\nChampoton, Campeche, in a large abandoned gravel pit having vertical\r\nbanks about 10 feet high. The pit was an irregular semicircle with an\r\napproximate radius of 100 yards and was bordered by a road on one side\r\nand elsewhere by low scrub vegetation. The pit was one of several found\r\nin the area and formerly was used as a source of limestone gravel used\r\nin constructing the road between Champoton and Escarcega. The exposed\r\nlimestone substratum was overlaid with chalky soil six to eight feet\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nMotmots were nesting in burrows dug in the layer of surface soil. A\r\ntotal of 101 burrows seemed to be in use or to have been used in 1962.\r\nNine appeared to be unused and 24 burrows evidently were abandoned\r\nbefore they were finished. The depths of 12 burrows selected at random\r\nwere 34, 32, 37, 25, 28, 44, 36, 36, 24, 37, 22, and 43 inches, and\r\naveraged 33.4 inches. In cross-section the burrows varied from round\r\n(three inches in diameter) to oval (three inches high and four inches\r\nwide). The inner ends of the burrows were enlarged with a depression in\r\nthe floor, where the eggs were laid.\r\n\r\nThe long axes of most burrows were straight and perpendicular to the\r\nface of the bank in which they were dug; two burrows nevertheless were\r\ncurved laterally, and one was U-shaped, having two entrances that\r\nopened about 12 inches apart.\r\n\r\nEggs and nestlings were found lying on the bare soil at the inner ends\r\nof the burrows; no nesting material was found.\r\n\r\nThe contents of 10 burrows that were excavated are summarized in Table\r\n1. Three nests contained no eggs or young. One of these was freshly\r\ndug. The other two empty burrows apparently had been recently occupied\r\nby nestlings and contained the foul smelling remains of fecal material,\r\nhundreds of beetle wings, and other undigestible parts of insects. The\r\nmanure was teeming with large fly larvae.\r\n\r\n  TABLE 1. Contents of 10 burrows of Turquoise-browed Motmots.\r\n\r\n  Burrow     Fresh    Eggs     Nestlings    Post-fledgling\r\n   1           *\r\n   2                   4\r\n   3                             3\r\n   4                             4\r\n   5                   1         3\r\n   6                             4\r\n   7                             1\r\n   8                   x\r\n   9                                            *\r\n  10                                            *\r\n\r\n  * Nothing.\r\n  x Broken egg shells.\r\n\r\nThree burrows contained nestlings; one had four young with pin\r\nfeathers, one a chick fully feathered, and one three newly hatched\r\nyoung and one egg.\r\n\r\nIn burrow 2, three eggs had advanced embryos and one was infertile; in\r\nburrow 3, the eggs had small embryos; and in burrow 4, the eggs\r\nappeared fresh. Burrows 3 and 4 were occupied by adult birds that did\r\nnot flush during the excavation of their burrows. They were easily\r\ncaught by hand and later prepared as specimens. One was a male and the\r\nother a female; each had a brood patch.\r\n\r\nPossibly females of this species raise more than one brood in a single\r\nnesting season, but I have no direct evidence of this. Such an\r\nhypothesis is suggested by the different stages of nestings found in\r\nthe burrows. Moreover, there were more than twice as many burrows as\r\nmotmots in the area. The largest number of individuals counted at any\r\ntime near the colony was 20 adults (about an hour after sunrise).\r\nAssuming that all of these birds had mates, the maximum number of\r\nadults present could have numbered about 40.\r\n\r\nThere is another bit of evidence for double broods. Because of fouling\r\nof the burrow that accompanies the raising of a brood of young, it\r\nseems improbable that a burrow would be used immediately for a second\r\nnesting attempt. Consequently digging a second burrow would be\r\nnecessary, if a second brood is raised.\r\n\r\nMost of my observations are in keeping with Skutch's detailed report\r\n(1947) of the species in Central America. According to him, eggs are\r\nlaid in April and May in Honduras and Guatamala, although he did not\r\nstate that breeding does not occur in other months. The observations in\r\nCampeche in early July suggest that breeding can occur over an extended\r\nperiod; Paynter (1955a:158) found the species to be in various stages\r\nof reproductive activity in April on the peninsula.\r\n\r\nSkutch suggested that the motmots he observed in Central America were\r\nsolitary nesters, and nest in \"groups\" only where suitable nesting\r\nsites are scarce. In Campeche, many suitable, seemingly identical, but\r\nunused, nesting sites were available within a few hundred yards of the\r\nsite of the actual nesting \"colony.\" Moreover, most of the burrows were\r\nonly a few feet apart and no agonistic behavior was witnessed. It seems\r\nthat this motmot is characterized by colonial nesting habits in\r\nCampeche, even where abundant sites for individual nesting efforts are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe species was abundant around the _cenotes_ at Chichen-Itza; adults\r\nwith enlarged gonads and brood patches and juveniles were taken at\r\nPiste as late as July 21.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (19): [Male], 40565, brood patch, 59.4 gm. (July 9),\r\n    [Male], 40564, testis 8 x 4 mm., brood patch, 68.0 gm. (July 9),\r\n    [Male], 40566, 74 gm. (July 9), [Female], 40567, juv. (July 9),\r\n    [Male], 40568, testis 5 x 3 mm., 68.3 gm. (July 10), [Male], 40578,\r\n    59.5 gm. (July 11), and [Female], 40577, ova to 2 mm., brood patch,\r\n    65.2 gm. (July 11), all from 5 km. S Champoton; [Male], 40560, 43.6\r\n    gm. (July 20), [Female], 40562, brood patch, 55 gm. (July 21), sex?\r\n    40561, 64 gm. (July 21), and [Female], 40563, juv. (July 22),\r\n    Piste. Eight nestlings (40569-76) that were taken from burrows at 5\r\n    km. S Champoton on July 11 had the following weights: 42.4 gm.,\r\n    39.7 gm., 38.5 gm., 12.2 gm., 40.0 gm., 30.7 gm., 26.8 gm., 19.0\r\n    gm. Mallophaga: _Philopterus_ sp., July 9.\r\n\r\n_Momotus momota lessonii_ Lesson: Blue-crowned Motmot.--For convenience,\r\nthe specimens from 5 km. S Champoton are assigned to _M. m. lessonii_\r\non the basis of measurements (wing 139 mm., tail 240 mm., culmen [from\r\nfeathers] 41.0 mm.) taken on one specimen (40579), which are within the\r\nlimits of the subspecies as described by Ridgway (1914). Two other\r\nspecimens from that locality were prepared as skeletons and their\r\nweights are essentially the same as those Paynter (1955a) recorded for\r\n_M. m. lessonii_. According to Paynter, there is a southward clinal\r\nincrease in size in this species between the smaller _M. m. exiguus_ in\r\nthe northern part of the peninsula and _M. m. lessonii_ in the extreme\r\nsouthern part. A more extensive series of specimens from the vicinity\r\nof Champoton probably would reveal a population intermediate in size\r\nbetween the typical representatives of the two races.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (3): [Female], 40579, 105 gm. (July 10), [Female], 40581,\r\n    98.9 gm. (July 11), [Male], 40580, 102.5 gm. (July 11), 5 km. S\r\n    Champoton.\r\n\r\n_Pteroglossus torquatus erythrozonus_ Ridgway: Collared Aracari.--A\r\nmale taken at Pueblo Nuevo X-can on July 27 and a female from 4 km. NNE\r\nFelipe Carrillo Puerto on August 15 had slightly enlarged gonads, which\r\nprobably were regressing. Apparently these are the first indications of\r\nbreeding activity for this species on the peninsula.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40586, testis 4 x 2 mm., 155 gm. (July 16),\r\n    7-1/2 km. W Escarcega; [Male], 40582, testis 10 x 5 mm., 169.1 gm.\r\n    (July 27), and [Female], 40583, ovary inactive, 137.3 gm. (July\r\n    29), Pueblo Nuevo X-can; [Female], 40584, ovary 10 x 6 mm., 169.5\r\n    gm. (August 15), and sex? 40585, 148.9 gm. (August 16), 4 km. NNE\r\n    Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Rhamphastos sulfuratus sulfuratus_ Lesson: Keel-billed Toucan.--This\r\nspecies was especially common west of Escarcega, where it was most\r\noften seen in small flocks of less than 10 birds. Presumably breeding\r\nhad already occurred; four specimens had inactive gonads.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (7): [Female], 40589, 367.3 gm. (July 12), [Male], 40588,\r\n    testis 8 x 3 mm., 414.5 gm. (July 14), [Female], 40590, ovary 11\r\n    mm., 347.4 gm. (July 15), [Male], 40591, testis 5 x 3 mm., 371 gm.\r\n    (July 15), [Male], 40593, testis 6 x 3 mm., 422.2 gm. (July 16) and\r\n    [Male], 40592, 401.5 gm. (July 16), 6-7-1/2 km. W Escarcega;\r\n    [Female], 40587, 395.5 gm. (July 28), Pueblo Nuevo X-can.\r\n\r\n_Piculus rubiginosus yucatanensis_ (Cabot): Red-capped Green\r\nWoodpecker.--Specimen (1): [Female], 40594, ovary inactive (7 x 4 mm.),\r\nextensive body molt, 67.7 gm. (August 17), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo\r\nPuerto. Mallophaga: _Penerirmus_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Drycopus lineatus similis_ (Lesson): Lineated Woodpecker.--Specimen\r\n(1): [Male], 40595, molting, 141.2 gm. (July 15), 7-1/2 km. W\r\nEscarcega.\r\n\r\n_Centurus aurifrons dubius_ (Cabot): Golden-fronted Woodpecker.--The\r\ngonads were moderately enlarged in several of the specimens taken in\r\nthe first half of July. The plumage was much worn in all specimens and\r\nsome were in early stages of molt. Apparently the breeding season on\r\nthe peninsula extends to at least mid-July. The specimen from Isla\r\nCozumel is assigned to _C. a. dubius_, following the systematic\r\ntreatment by Selander and Giller (1963).\r\n\r\n    Specimens (10): sex? 40602, 75.0 gm. (July 8), and [Female], 40601,\r\n    ovary 6 x 3 mm. (enlarged oviduct), 76.4 gm. (July 10), 1 km. S\r\n    Puerto Real, Isla del Carmen; [Male], 40599, testis 6 x 8 mm.,\r\n    101.3 gm.

NNE Felipe\r\nCarrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Xiphorhynchus flavigaster_ (Swainson): Ivory-billed Woodcreeper.--\r\nAccording to Paynter (1955a:173), indications of breeding have been\r\nobserved in specimens of this species taken between March 27 and June\r\n5. A male taken on August 15 had moderately enlarged (probably\r\nregressing) testes and was well into the molt.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40619, testis 5 x 3 mm., 51.5 gm.,\r\n    molting--5th primaries and middle pair of rectrices ensheathed\r\n    (August 15), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Lepidocolaptes souleyetii_ (Des Murs): Streak-headed Woodhewer.--This\r\nappears to be the second specimen recorded from the peninsula (see\r\nTraylor, 1941).\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40621, testis 3 x 1 mm., 26.6 gm., molting--6th\r\n    primaries ensheathed, middle pair of rectrices are new (July 17), 1\r\n    km.

Adults were observed feeding young\r\nfledglings 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega on July 15, and a juvenile was taken.\r\nGonads of males were in full breeding condition.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40630, testis 13 x 6 mm., 81.3 gm.

WSW Puerto Juarez.\r\n\r\n_Pyrocephalus rubinus_ (Boddaert): Vermillion Flycatcher.--This species\r\nwas seen only in the arid scrub 2-13 km. WSW of Sisal. Breeding\r\nseemingly had ended by early August, as evidenced by four adults that\r\nshowed no gonadal activity and were in advanced stages of molt.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Female], 40638, juv., 12.1 gm.

A male and two females from Piste taken on July\r\n21 and a female from Pueblo Nuevo X-can (July 29) had slightly enlarged\r\n(probably regressing) gonads. Three immatures were collected and adults\r\nwere seen feeding young fledglings at Piste.

July 28.\r\n\r\n_Myiopagis veridicata_ (Vieillot): Yellow-crowned Elaenia.--The only\r\nprevious breeding record is of a male that was taken on April 29. My\r\nonly specimen has nearly fully enlarged testes.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40688, testis 7 x 4 mm., 13.1 gm. (July 17),\r\n    1 km. N, 13 km. W Escarcega.\r\n\r\n_Progne subis subis_ (Linnaeus): Purple Martin.--A large migrant flock\r\nof several thousand individuals of this species was present for several\r\ndays in August at Rancho San Miguel.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (3): [Female], 40723, ovary inactive, 48.6 gm.

NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Petrochelidon fulva citata_ Van Tyne: Cave Swallow.--Throughout our\r\nstay at Piste, large numbers of Cave Swallows were seen flying in and\r\nout of the small opening of a well-like _cenote_ in the center of the\r\nvillage. Specimens were easily collected in a mist net placed across\r\nthe opening. No young Cave Swallows were taken and gonads of adults\r\nwere in various stages of reproductive activity. A few individuals\r\ntaken were beginning to molt. Probably the swallows were nesting in the\r\n_cenote_ although the nests were inaccessible to view. Previous\r\nbreeding records are for April (Paynter, 1955a:209).\r\n\r\n    Twenty-two specimens were collected, of which the following were\r\n    taken at Piste, July 21-25: [Male], 40693, testis 6 x 3 mm., 18.4\r\n    gm.; [Male], 40696, 16.4 gm.; [Female], 40697, 18.2 gm.; [Male],\r\n    40695, 15.0 gm.; [Female], 40690, ovary inactive, 18.4 gm.,\r\n    molting--2nd primaries ensheathed; [Male], 40692, testis 5 x 3 mm.,\r\n    17.9 gm.; [Female], 40698, 18.3 gm.; [Female], 40702, ovary 7 x 3\r\n    mm., 18.9 gm.; [Female], 40703, ovary 6 x 3 mm., 17.5 gm.; [Male],\r\n    40713, testis 3 mm., 18.4 gm.; [Female], 40704, 16.5 gm.; [Male],\r\n    40705, 20.3 gm.; [Male], 40699, testis 2 mm., 18.6 gm.,\r\n    molting--2nd primaries ensheathed; [Female], 40700, ovary 5 x 3\r\n    mm., 18.5 gm., molting--1st primaries ensheathed; [Female], 40701,\r\n    ovary 5 x 3 mm., 16.5 gm., molting--1st primaries ensheathed;\r\n    [Male], 40707, testis 7 x 5 mm., 19.9; [Male], 40708, testis 4 x 3\r\n    mm., 18.4 gm.; [Female], 40709, ovary 4 x 3 mm., 18.0 gm.; sex?\r\n    40711, 18.3 gm., molting--1st and 2nd primaries ensheathed.\r\n\r\n    Additional specimens are: [Female], 40718, 16.5 gm., molting--3rd\r\n    primaries ensheathed (August 16), and [Female], 40719, 18.5 gm.,\r\n    molting 1st primaries ensheathed (August 16), 4 km. NNE Felipe\r\n    Carrillo Puerto; [Male], 40689, testis 1 mm., 16.2 gm.,\r\n    molting--2nd primaries ensheathed (August 10), 13 km. WSW Sisal.\r\n    Mallophaga: _Philopterus excisus_, July 21; _Myrsidea_ sp. July 21\r\n    and 25.\r\n\r\n_Stelgidopteryx ruficollis_ Audubon: Rough-winged Swallow.--Previous\r\nrecords indicate that three subspecies of this species occur on the\r\nYucatan Peninsula (Paynter, 1955a:209). One of these, _S. r. ridgwayi_,\r\nis resident. _S. r. serripennis_, representing the breeding population\r\noccurring from British Columbia and New Hampshire over much of the\r\nUnited States to central California, central Texas, and the Gulf\r\nstates, has been taken on the peninsula in winter. Paynter referred two\r\nspecimens taken in late September and three January-taken specimens to\r\n_S. r. stuarti_, the highland race that breeds from the mountains of\r\nsouthern Veracruz to Guatamala.\r\n\r\nAllan R. Phillips had identified two immature individuals (40694 and\r\n40712) from Piste as _S. r. stuarti_; one specimen from Puerto Juarez\r\nalso is an immature and is nearly identical to those from Piste. Two\r\nadults from Piste (40691 and 40710) are noticeably darker dorsally than\r\nthe immatures but are molting extensively and their identification to\r\nsubspecies is equivocal. Two other adults (40706 and 40715) were\r\nprepared as skeletons.\r\n\r\nAlthough mid-July seems early for _S. r. stuarti_ to be present on the\r\npeninsula it is not too surprising since the three specimens positively\r\nidentified are immature birds and young possibly arrive earlier than do\r\nadults. But, the immature specimens possibly are atypical individuals\r\nof the resident population of _S. r. ridgwayi_.\r\n\r\nExcept for the immature individual from 5 km. WSW Puerto Juarez, all\r\nspecimens were taken in mist nets over the _cenote_ at Piste where\r\n_Petrochelidon fulva_ also was obtained.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (7): [Male], 40694, imm., 16.2 gm., [Female], 40691,\r\n    ovary inactive, 16.4 gm., molting--general body molt, 5th primaries\r\n    and middle pair of rectrices ensheathed, [Female], 40712, imm.,\r\n    14.5 gm., [Female], 40706, 14.8 gm., [Male], 40715, 16.4 gm.,\r\n    [Male], 40710, 18.5 gm., molting--general body molt, 1st primaries\r\n    and middle pair of rectrices ensheathed, all from Piste, July 21\r\n    and 25; [Male], 40720, imm., 15.5 gm. (August 1), 5 km. WSW Puerto\r\n    Juarez.\r\n\r\n_Hirundo rustica erythrogaster_ Boddaert: Barn Swallow.--Specimen (1):\r\n[Female], 40721, imm., 7.3 gm. (August 18), apparently an early\r\nmigrant, 2 km. WSW Sisal.\r\n\r\n_Iridoprocne albilinea_ (Lawrence): Mangrove Swallow.--Specimen (1):\r\n[Female], 40722, imm. (July 7), Puerto Real, Isla del Carmen.\r\n\r\n_Cissilopha yucatanica_ (Dubois): Yucatan Jay.--Heretofore, breeding\r\nactivity has been recorded only in March (Paynter, 1955a:217). All\r\nspecimens in my collection have extensively worn plumage and were\r\nbeginning to molt.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (6): [Male], 40726, left testis 9 x 7 mm., right testis 4\r\n    x 2 mm., brood patch, 122.3 gm., molting--1st and 2nd primaries\r\n    ensheathed (July 10), 5 km. S Champoton; [Male], 40727, testis 5 x\r\n    3 mm., brood patch, 125.6 gm., molting--1st and 2nd primaries\r\n    ensheathed (July 11), 5 km. SW Champoton; [Female], 40728, 109.8\r\n    gm. (July 13), and sex? 40729, 109.5 gm. (July 15), 7-1/2 km. W\r\n    Escarcega; [Female], 40730, imm., 110.3 gm. (July 21), Piste;\r\n    [Female], 40731, ovary inactive, brood patch refeathering, 121 gm.,\r\n    molting--2nd and 3rd primaries ensheathed (August 16), 4 km. NNE\r\n    Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Cyanocorax yncas maya_ (van Rossem): Green Jay.--There are records of\r\nbreeding by this species on the peninsula for April 28 and 29, and June\r\n4 (Paynter, 1955a:215, 216).\r\n\r\n    Specimens (4): [Male], 40740, testis 5 x 3 mm., 81.2 gm. (July 16),\r\n    7-1/2 km. W Escarcega; [Female], 40739, juv., 62.3 gm. (July 21),\r\n    [Male], 40737, 64.5 gm. (July 21), and [Female], 40738, 64.1 gm.\r\n    (July 21), Piste.\r\n\r\n_Psilorhinus morio_ (Wagler): Brown Jay.--Specimens (3): [Female],\r\n40742, 203.5 gm. (July 13), [Male], 40743, juv., 170 gm. (July 14),\r\n7-1/2 km. W Escarcega; [Male], 40741, juv., 193.7 gm. (August 14), 4\r\nkm. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Thryothorus lucovicianus albinucha_ (Cabot): Carolina Wren.--This wren\r\nformerly was considered to be a species (_T. albinucha_). In the light\r\nof evidence presented by Lowery and Berrett (1963), it is advisable to\r\nfollow Paynter (1955a:219) and consider _albinucha_ to be a subspecies\r\nof _T. ludovicianus_. The only previous evidence of breeding by this\r\nspecies on the peninsula was a male having slightly enlarged gonads\r\ntaken by Paynter (1955a:219) on March 9.\r\n\r\n    Specimen (1): [Male], 40754, juv., 16.8 gm. (August 14), 4 km. NNE\r\n    Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Thryothorus maculipectus canobrunneus_ (Ridgway): Spotted-breasted\r\nWren.--According to Paynter (1955a:220) this species breeds from\r\nmid-March to May 23. Gonads were moderately active in our specimens as\r\nearly as mid-July.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (4): [Female], 40758, ovary (6 x 3 mm.) granular (July\r\n    14), and [Male], 40757, testis 5 x 3 mm., 15.3 gm. (July 14), 7-1/2\r\n    km. W Escarcega; [Female], 40755, ovary 6 x 3 mm. (ova to 1 mm.),\r\n    12.7 gm. (July 21), Piste; [Male], 40756, ovary 4 x 3 mm., 16.8 gm.\r\n    (August 3), 4 km. WSW Puerto Juarez.\r\n\r\n_Troglodytes musculus_ (Naumann): Southern House Wren.--Specimen (1):\r\n[Female], 40760, juv. (August 2), 4 km. WSW Puerto Juarez.\r\n\r\n_Troglodytes beani_ (Ridgway): Cozumel Wren.--Specimens (2): [Female],\r\n40761, 13.3 gm. (August 9), and [Male], 40762, imm., 13.6 gm. (August\r\n9), 3-1/2 km. N San Miguel, Isla Cozumel.\r\n\r\n_Campylorhynchus yucatanicus_ (Hellmayr): Yucatan Wren.--This species\r\nwas abundant in the coastal scrub west of Sisal where some breeding\r\nactivity was noted. A few individuals were carrying nest material and\r\nseveral were feeding young. There were many old and abandoned nests and\r\napparently the breeding season was nearly over. The only previous\r\nbreeding record is for March 19 when a newly completed nest was found\r\n(Paynter, 1955a:218).\r\n\r\n    Specimens (4): [Male], 40750, imm., 32.4 gm.

(August 9), 4.3 km.\r\n    WSW Sisal; [Female], 40753, 31.0 gm. (August 11), 6-1/2 km. WSW\r\n    Sisal.\r\n\r\n_Melanoptila glabrirostris cozumelana_ (Paynter): Black Catbird.--\r\nApparently the only previous record of breeding by this species was\r\nPaynter's (1955b) mention of a male from Quintana Roo with enlarged\r\ngonads on June 26. The three adults in the collection here reported on\r\nwere in nearly full reproductive activity.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (4): [Male], 40764, imm., 40.5 gm. (August 8), [Female],\r\n    40767, testis 8 x 4 mm., 42.0 gm., heavy fat (August 8), [Female],\r\n    40765, ovary active (oviduct enlarged), brood patch, 35.2 gm.\r\n    (August 10), and [Male], 40766, testis 9 x 6 mm., 35 gm. (August\r\n    10), from 2-1/2-3-1/2 km. N San Miguel, Isla Cozumel.\r\n\r\n_Mimus gilvus_ (Vieillot): Tropical Mockingbird.--The only breeding\r\nrecord heretofore is by Paynter (1955a:226) of newly-fledged juveniles\r\ntaken on May 26 and 29.

(July 27), all from Piste.\r\n\r\n_Icterus cucullatus_ Nelson: Hooded Oriole.--This species has not\r\nheretofore been recorded as breeding on Isla Cozumel; testes were\r\nnearly fully enlarged but probably regressing in the only specimen\r\ntaken there. It had been banded (USF&WS no. 601-87003) on the island in\r\n1961 as an adult. According to Paynter (1955a:269) there are no\r\nbreeding records for this species on the mainland later than April,\r\nMarch 25 being the earliest date. The species was observed nesting on\r\nIsla del Carmen and adult males taken there and 5 km.

Adult males with enlarged testes were\r\nobtained on July 11 and August 10, and three juveniles were taken\r\nsouthwest of Sisal on August 10, 16, and 18.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (7): [Male], 40903, testis 9 x 7 mm., 39.7 gm. (July 11),\r\n    and [Female], 40904, 34.0 gm. (July 11), 5 km. S Champoton; [Male],\r\n    40898, testis 7 x 4 mm., 33.8 gm. (August 10), and [Female], 40899,\r\n    juv. (rectrices and remiges ensheathed basally), 32.8 gm. (August\r\n    10), 13 km. WSW Sisal; [Male], 40900, fledgling, 18.4 gm. (August\r\n    18), 2 km. WSW Sisal; [Female], 40901, ovary granular, 37.4 gm.,\r\n    molting--1st primaries ensheathed (August 15), and [Male], 40902,\r\n    imm., 34.0 gm. (August 16), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Cyanocompsa parellina_ (Bonaparte): Blue Bunting.--Specimens (2):\r\n[Male], 40906, imm. (July 15), and [Male], 40905, testis 10 x 7 mm.,\r\n15.2 mm. (July 15), 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega.\r\n\r\n_Tiaris olivacea pusilla_ (Swainson): Yellow-faced Grassquit.--The only\r\nrecords of breeding, thus far, are by Paynter (1955a:291) for March 12\r\nand June 14. A male (40907) taken 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto on\r\nAugust 14 had fully enlarged testes (8 x 5 mm.).\r\n\r\n_Tiaris olivacea intermedia_ (Ridgway): Yellow-faced Grassquit.--Although\r\nfemales taken on Isla Cozumel exhibited no reproductive activity, two\r\nmales had moderately enlarged testes. These seem to be the first\r\nrecords of breeding in this subspecies, which is endemic to Isla\r\nCozumel.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (5): [Male], 40908, testis 6 z 4 mm., 10.5 gm. (August\r\n    8), [Female], 40912, ovary inactive, 9.5 gm. (August 8), [Female],\r\n    40909, ovary inactive, 10.4 gm. (August 9), [Male], 40910, testis 5\r\n    x 3 mm., 11.5 gm., molting--1st primaries ensheathed (August 9),\r\n    and [Male], 40911, 11.5 gm. (August 10), all from {2-1/2}-{3-1/2}\r\n    km. N San Miguel, Isla Cozumel.\r\n\r\n_Sporophila torquiola morelleti_ (Bonaparte): White-collared Seedeater.\r\n--Breeding is known for this species in May and a male collected on\r\nSeptember 2 was in breeding condition (Paynter, 1955a:293). Our records\r\nseem to be the first for the summer. Specimens taken in July and August\r\nwere breeding.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (7): [Female], 40918, 9.2 gm. (July 8), 1 km. SW Puerto\r\n    Real, Isla del Carmen; [Male], 40919, testis 7 x 6 mm., 8.2 gm.\r\n    (July 15), 7-1/2 km. W Escarcega; [Female], 40913, ovary inactive,\r\n    7.9 gm. (August 4), 4 km. WSW Puerto Juarez; [Male], 40914, testis\r\n    minute, 7.8 gm. (August 14), [Female], 40915, ova to 6 mm. (August\r\n    15), [Female], 40917, ovary moderately active, 7.0 gm. (August 16),\r\n    and [Male], 40916, testis 7 x 5 mm., 7.6 gm. (August 16), 4 km. NNE\r\n    Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Volatinia jacarina splendens_ (Vieillot): Blue-black Grassquit.--The\r\nonly previous record of breeding is a male having slightly enlarged\r\ntestes taken on June 1 (Paynter, 1955a:293). Our specimens showed\r\nvarious stages of reproductive activity when taken on July 10.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (6): [Male], 40926, 8.9 gm. (July 10), and [Male], 40925,\r\n    testis 2 x 1 mm., 8.5 gm. (July 10), 1 km. S Puerto Real, Isla del\r\n    Carmen; [Male], 40924, testis 4 x 2 mm. (July 10), [Male], 40922,\r\n    testis 6 x 4 mm., 8.3 gm.

S\r\n    Champoton.\r\n\r\n_Arremonops rufivirgata verticalis_ Ridgway: Olive Sparrow.--Apparently\r\nthe only previous record of breeding was the laying female on June 14\r\nreported by Paynter (1955a: 294). Males collected in July and August\r\nhad enlarged testes; a juvenile, barely able to fly, was taken on\r\nAugust 14. Two specimens were beginning to molt.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (9): [Female], 40932, ova to 1 mm., 20.8 gm. (July 21),\r\n    and [Male], 40933, testis 8 x 6 mm., 21.2 gm.

(August 15), 4 km. NNE Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\r\n\r\n_Arremonops chloronota chloronota_ (Salvin): Green-backed Sparrow.--\r\nEvidence presented by Monroe (1963) indicates that _A. chloronota_ and\r\n_A. conirostris_ are not conspecific. Specimens collected in breeding\r\ncondition in July seem to be the first breeding records of this species\r\non the peninsula.\r\n\r\n    Specimens (7): [Female], 40942, ova to 3 mm., 29.6 gm.

The specimens of the Streak-headed Woodhewer and\r\nthe Louisiana Waterthrush are the second ones of each species taken on\r\nthe peninsula. The Purple Martin taken on August 14, the Barn Swallow\r\non August 18, and the Louisiana Waterthrush on August 14 represent\r\nearliest known autumn dates for these transients.\r\n\r\nEvidence for breeding is given for 20 species for the first time and\r\nextensions of the known breeding seasons are presented for 41 species.\r\n\r\nFourteen genera, representing about 19 species, of Mallophaga are\r\nreported for 20 different species of bird hosts.\r\n\r\nAt Piste and Puerto Juarez, species of birds such as the Blue\r\nHoneycreeper and the Red-capped Manakin, normally thought of as\r\ncharacteristic of more humid areas, were found breeding in numbers near\r\n_cenotes_. However, they were not seen to venture far into the\r\nsurrounding deciduous forest. The availability of suitable habitat\r\nbrought on by the rainy season and the regular occurrence of _cenotes_\r\nhelps to explain the presence of such species far outside the Rain\r\nForest zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nBLAKE, E.
