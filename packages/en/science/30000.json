Order I. PYGOPODES\r\n\r\nGREBES. Family COLYMBIDÆ\r\n\r\nGrebes are birds having a ducklike body, but with pointed bills. Their\r\nfeet, too, are unlike those of the Ducks, each toe having its separate\r\nweb, and having a broad flat nail. Their wings are very small for the\r\nsize of the body, making it impossible for them to rise in flight from\r\nthe land. They rise from the water by running a few yards along the\r\nsurface until they have secured sufficient headway to allow them to\r\nlaunch themselves into the air. After having risen from the water their\r\nflight is very swift and strong. On land they are very awkward and can\r\nonly progress by a series of awkward hops; they generally lie flat on\r\ntheir breasts, but occasionally stand up, supporting themselves upon\r\ntheir whole tarsus. Grebes, together with the Loons, are the most expert\r\naquatic birds that we have, diving like a flash and swimming for an\r\nincredible distance under water.\r\n\r\nPage 11\r\n\r\n1. WESTERN GREBE. _Aechmophorus occidentalis_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Western parts of North America, from southern Alaska southward;\r\neast to Minnesota and south in winter to the southern parts of the\r\nUnited States and Mexico. Breeds from the Dakotas and northern\r\nCalifornia northward. These are the largest of the American Grebes;\r\nowing to their unusually long necks, they are frequently called \"Swan\r\nGrebes.\" They are very timid birds and conceal themselves in the rushes\r\non the least suspicion of danger. At times, to escape observation, they\r\nwill entirely submerge their body, leaving only their head and part of\r\nthe long neck visible above the water. This Grebe cannot be mistaken for\r\nany other because of the long slender neck and the long pointed bill,\r\nwhich has a slight upward turn. They nest abundantly in the marshes of\r\nNorth Dakota and central Canada. Their nests are made of decayed rushes,\r\nand are built over the water, being fastened to the rushes so that the\r\nbottom of the nest rests in the water. The nesting season is at its\r\nheight during the latter part of May. They lay from three to five eggs,\r\nthe ground color of which is a pale blue; this color is, however, always\r\nconcealed by a thin chalky deposit, and this latter is frequently\r\nstained to a dirty white. Size 2.40 × 1.55.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HOLBOELL'S GREBE. _Colymbus holboellii._\r\n\r\nRange.--Throughout North America, breeding from northern United States\r\nnorthward and wintering from the middle to the southern portions of the\r\nUnited States. In regard to size this Grebe comes next to the Western,\r\nbeing 19 in. in length. This bird can be distinguished by the white\r\ncheeks and throat and the reddish brown foreneck. They breed abundantly\r\nin the far north placing their floating islands of decayed vegetation in\r\nthe water in the midst of the marsh grass. They lay from three to six\r\neggs of a dingy white color which have the stained surface common to\r\nGrebes eggs. Size 2.35 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 013: Chalky bluish white, stained buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Western Grebe Holboell's Grebe.]\r\n[Illustration: White, stained buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Right-hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 12\r\n\r\n[Illustration 014: Walter Raine\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF HOLBOELL'S GREBE\r\nLake Winnipegosis, Manitoba.]\r\n\r\nPage 13\r\n\r\n3. HORNED GREBE. Colymbus auritus.\r\n\r\nRange.--The whole of North America, breeding in the interior from North\r\nDakota northwest; winters along the Gulf Coast. This species is one of\r\nthe most beautiful of the Grebes, having in the breeding season buffy\r\near tufts, black cheeks and throat, and chestnut neck, breast and sides.\r\nThey breed abundantly in the marshy flats of North Dakota and the\r\ninterior of Canada. They build a typical Grebe's nest, a floating mass\r\nof decayed matter which stains the naturally white eggs to a dirty\r\nbrown. The number of eggs varies from three to seven. Size 1.70 × 1.15.\r\nData.--Devils Lake, N. Dakota, June 20, 1900. 6 eggs much stained. Nest\r\nfloating in 4 ft. of water, a large mass of rotten rushes and weeds.\r\nCollector. James Smalley.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. EARED GREBE. _Colymbus nigricollis californicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Mississippi, breeding from Texas to\r\nManitoba and wintering along the Pacific Coast of the United States and\r\nfrom Texas southward.\r\n\r\nEared Grebes differ from the preceding in having the entire neck\r\nblackish. They nest very abundantly throughout the west, in favorable\r\nlocalities, from Texas to Minnesota and Dakota. Their nests are\r\nconstructed in the same manner as the preceding varieties and are\r\nlocated in similar localities. As do all the Grebes when leaving the\r\nnest, they cover the eggs with the damp rushes from around the base of\r\nthe nest. This is probably for the purpose of assisting incubation\r\nduring their absence, by the action of the sun's rays on the wet mass.\r\nAs they are nearly always thus covered upon the approach of anyone, this\r\nmay be done also as a protection from discovery. They lay from three to\r\neight bluish white eggs with the usual chalky and discolored appearance.\r\nThe breeding season is at its height early in June, or earlier, in the\r\nsouthern portion of its range. Size 1.75 × 1.20. Data.--Artesian, S.\r\nDakota, June 21, 1899. Nest of rushes, floating in three feet of water.\r\nLarge colony in a small lake. Collector, F. A. Patton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 015: Horned Grebe. Eared Grebe.]\r\n[Illustration: Buffy white, nest stained.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white, stained.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 14\r\n\r\n[Illustration 016: Walter Raine\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF HORNED GREBE\r\nSaltcoats Marshes, Assiniboia, June 6, 1901.]\r\n[Illustration left margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 15\r\n\r\n5. MEXICAN GREBE. _Colymbus dominicus brachypterus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Texas and Lower California southward to South America,\r\nbreeding throughout its range.\r\n\r\nThe Least Grebe is by far the smallest of the Grebes in this country,\r\nbeing but 10 in. in length; it can not be mistaken for any other, the\r\nEared Grebe being the only species of this family found in the same\r\nlocalities during the summer. These little Grebes nest very abundantly\r\nalong the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the nesting season lasting from\r\nthe latter part of May until well into December.\r\n\r\nTheir nests are floating piles of grass and weeds upon which they lay\r\nfrom three to five chalky white eggs, which are always discolored,\r\nsometimes to a deep chocolate hue. These eggs average a great deal\r\ndarker in color than do any of the other Grebes. In a series of fifty\r\nsets fully half were a rich brown tint. Size 1.40 × .95.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. PIED-BILLED GREBE. _Podilymbus podiceps._\r\n\r\nRange.--From the British provinces southward to Argentine Republic,\r\nbreeding locally throughout the northern portions of its range.\r\n\r\nThe Dabchick, as this bird is called, is the most evenly distributed\r\nbird of this family. It is nowhere especially abundant, nor is it,\r\nexcept in a very few localities, regarded as rare. Consequently it is\r\nthe best known bird of the species. They do not congregate in such large\r\nnumbers as the other Grebes during the nesting season, but one or more\r\npairs may be found in almost any favorable locality. These birds render\r\ntheir floating nest a little more substantial than those of the\r\npreceding varieties by the addition of mud which they bring up from the\r\nbottom of the pond; this addition also tends to soil the eggs more,\r\nconsequently the eggs of this bird are, as a general rule, browner than\r\nthe other Grebes with the exception of the Least. The bird may always be\r\nknown by the shape of its bill which is higher than it is broad, and in\r\nthe summer is white with a black band across the middle. The throat is\r\nalso black at this season. They lay from five to nine eggs commencing\r\nabout the middle of May. Size 1.70 × 1.18.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 017: Deep buff or rich brown.]\r\n[Illustration: Mexican Grebe. Pied-billed Grebe.]\r\n[Illustration: Deep buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right-hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 16\r\n\r\n[Illustration 018: PIED-BILLED GREBE.]\r\n\r\nPage 17\r\n\r\nLOONS. Family GAVIIDAE\r\n\r\nLoons may be likened to gigantic Grebes from which they differ\r\nexternally, chiefly in the full webbed foot instead of the individually\r\nwebbed toes of the Grebe, and in the sharper, more pointed and\r\nspear-like bill. These birds are similar in their habits to the Grebes,\r\nexcept that their homes are generally more substantially built and are\r\nplaced upon a solid foundation, generally upon an island in some inland\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nBoth Loons and Grebes are literally \"Water witches,\" being practically,\r\nand in the case of Grebes, actually, born in the water and living in it\r\never afterwards. Loons are strong fliers, but like the Grebes, because\r\nof their small wings they must get their first impetus from the water in\r\norder to rise; in case there is any wind blowing they also make use of\r\nthis by starting their flight against it. They are very peculiar birds\r\nand the expression \"crazy as a loon\" is not a fanciful one, being formed\r\nfrom their early morning and evening antics when two or more of them\r\nwill race over the top of the water, up and down the lake, all the while\r\nuttering their demoniacal laughter. They vie with the Grebes in diving\r\nand disappear at the flash of a gun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 019: EGG OF LOON. Dark greenish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 18\r\n\r\n7. LOON. _Gavia immer._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America north of the Mexican boundary, breeding from the\r\nnorthern parts of the United States northward.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Grebes, Loons do not build in colonies, generally not more\r\nthan one, or at the most two pairs nesting on the same lake or pond;\r\nneither do they seek the marshy sloughs in which Grebes dwell,\r\npreferring the more open, clear bodies of water. The common Loon may be\r\nknown in summer by the entirely black head and neck with the complete\r\nribbon of black and white stripes encircling the lower neck and the\r\nnarrower one which crosses the throat. The back is spotted with white.\r\nIn some sections Loons build no nest, simply scooping a hollow out in\r\nthe sand, while in other places they construct quite a large nest of\r\nsticks, moss and grasses. It is usually placed but a few feet from the\r\nwaters edge, so that at the least suspicion the bird can slide off its\r\neggs into the water, where it can cope with any enemy. The nests are\r\nnearly always concealed under the overhanging bushes that line the\r\nshore; the one shown in the full page illustration, however, was located\r\nupon the top of an old muskrat house. The two eggs which they lay are a\r\nvery dark greenish brown in color, with black spots. Size 3.50 × 2.25.\r\nData.--Lake Sunapee, N. H., June 28, 1895. Nest placed under the bushes\r\nat the waters edge. Made of rushes, weeds and grasses; a large structure\r\nnearly three feet in diameter. Collector, H. A. Collins.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. YELLOW-BILLED LOON. _Gavia adamsi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern North America, along the Arctic and northern\r\nAlaskan coasts.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow-billed Loon with the exception of its whitish or yellowish\r\nbill in place of the black, is practically otherwise indistinguishable\r\nfrom the common Loon. It averages somewhat larger in size. This is one\r\nof the most northerly breeding birds and it is only within a very few\r\nyears that anything has been learned about the breeding habits. Their\r\nnesting habits and eggs are precisely like the preceding except that the\r\nlatter average a little larger. Size 3.60 × 2.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. BLACK-THROATED LOON. _Gavia arctica._.\r\n\r\nRange.--From northern United States northward, breeding along the Arctic\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\nThis species can be easily separated from the Loon by the gray crown and\r\nwhite streaks down the back of the neck. Its size, too, is about five\r\ninches shorter. The nesting habits are the same as the Loons and the\r\neggs have rather more of an olive tint besides having the majority of\r\nspots at the larger end. Size 3.10 × 2.00.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 020: Loon. Black-throated Loon.]\r\n[Illustration: left-hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 19\r\n\r\n10. PACIFIC LOON. _Gavia pacifica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America along the coast chiefly, breeding from\r\nAlaska south to British Columbia. In winter, south along the coast to\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from the Black-throated only in the tint of the\r\nhead reflections. The habits are the same as those of the other members\r\nof the family. They lay two eggs of a greenish brown or greenish gray\r\nhue with black spots. Size 3.10 × 1.90. Data.--Yukon River, Alaska, June\r\n28, 1902. Nest of rubbish on an island; found by a miner.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. RED-THROATED LOON. _Gavia stellata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern parts of North America, breeding from southern Canada\r\nnorthward in the interior on both coasts. South to the middle portions\r\nof the United States in winter.\r\n\r\nThis is the smallest of the Loon family, being twenty-five inches in\r\nlength. In plumage it is wholly unlike any of the other members at all\r\nseasons of the year. In summer the back, head and neck are gray, the\r\nlatter being striped with white. A large chestnut patch adorns the front\r\nof the lower part of the neck. In winter the back is spotted with white,\r\nwhereas all the others are unspotted at this period. The nesting habits\r\nare identical with the other species; the ground color of the two eggs\r\nis also the same. Size 2.00 × 1.75.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 021: Pacific Loon.

At this season numbers\r\nof them are apt to lose their bearings and may sometimes be found with\r\ntheir feet frozen in some of our inland ponds. Puffins are heavily built\r\nbirds in appearance, but are very active both on the wing and in the\r\nwater. Their wings are much larger comparatively than those of the other\r\nmembers of this family, so they are enabled to perform evolutions in the\r\nair, which are withheld from the others. They stand upright on the sole\r\nof the foot and are able to walk quite easily on land. Puffins have very\r\nheavy and deep but thin bills, which are entirely unlike those of any\r\nother bird and often give then the name of Parrot Auks. Puffins, Auks\r\nand Murres are otherwise recognized by the presence of but three toes\r\nwhich are webbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 023: NEST AND EGGS OF PIED-BILLED GREBE.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 22\r\n\r\n12. TUFTED PUFFIN. _Lunda cirrhata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast from Alaska southward to southern California,\r\nbreeding locally throughout their range.\r\n\r\nTufted Puffins are the largest of the Puffins. In the breeding plumage,\r\nthey are a sooty brownish or black color; the cheeks are white, and a\r\nlong tuft of straw colored feathers extends back from each eye; the bill\r\nis bright red and greenish yellow. They breed commonly on the\r\nFarallones, where two or three broods are raised by a bird in a single\r\nseason, but much more abundantly on the islands in the north. Their\r\nsingle eggs are laid in burrows in the ground or else in natural\r\ncrevices formed by the rocks. The eggs are pure white or pale buff and\r\nare without gloss. They very often have barely perceptible shell\r\nmarkings of dull purplish color. The eggs are laid about the middle of\r\nJune. Size 2.80 × 1.90. Data.--Farallone Is., May 27, 1887. Single egg\r\nlaid in crevice of rocks. Collector, W. O. Emerson.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. PUFFIN. _Fratercula arctica arctica._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic Coast, breeding from the Bay of Fundy northward.\r\nWinters from breeding range along the New England Coast.\r\n\r\nThe common Puffin has the cheeks, chin and underparts white; upper parts\r\nand a band across the throat, blackish. Bill deep and thin, and colored\r\nwith red, orange and yellow. They breed in large numbers on Bird Rock in\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence. The nest is either among the natural crevices\r\nof the\r\n\r\n[Illustration 024: Tufted Puffin. Puffin.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 23\r\n\r\nrocks, or in burrows excavated in the ground by the birds. These burrows\r\nvary in length from two and a half to four or five feet. Except upon the\r\npositive knowledge of the absence of the bird, it is a hazardous thing\r\nto put the hand in one of these burrows for the bird can, and will nip\r\nthe fingers, sometimes to the bone. They lay but a single egg, usually\r\ndull white and unmarked, but in some cases obscurely marked with reddish\r\nbrown. Size 2.50 × 1.75. Data.--So. Labrador, June 23, 1884. Single egg\r\nlaid at end of burrow in the ground. Collector, J. H. Jameson.\r\n\r\n\r\n13a. LARGE-BILLED PUFFIN. _Fratercula arctica naumanni._\r\n\r\nA more northerly subspecies of the last, inhabiting the Arctic region on\r\nthe Atlantic side. The bird is somewhat larger but otherwise\r\nindistinguishable from the common species. The eggs are exactly the same\r\nor average a trifle larger. Size 2.55 × 1.80. Data.--Iceland, July 6,\r\n1900. Single egg in hole under a rock. Collector, Chas. Jefferys.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. HORNED PUFFIN. _Fratercula corniculata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast from Alaska to British Columbia. The Horned Puffin\r\ndiffers from the common in that the blackish band across the throat\r\nextends upwards in a point to the bill. Their nesting habits are\r\nprecisely the same as those of the preceding species. A single pure\r\nwhite egg is laid; the shell is slightly rougher than those of the\r\nothers. Size 2.65 × 1.80. Data.--Round Is., Alaska, June 24, 1884.\r\nSingle egg laid at end of burrow in ground; no nest. Collector, G. L.\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. RHINOCEROS AUKLET. _Cerorhinca monocerata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast, breeding from British Columbia northward and\r\nwintering southward to Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe Rhinoceros Auklet or Horned Auk has a much smaller bill than the\r\nPuffins; in the summer this is adorned at the base by a horn from which\r\nit takes its name. There are also slender plumes from above and below\r\nthe eyes. Unlike the Puffins, these birds sit upon their whole tarsus.\r\n\r\nThey nest on islands of the North Pacific Coast from Vancouver\r\nnorthward. A single egg is laid in crevices among the rocks or in\r\nburrows in the ground. It is similar both in size and shape to that of\r\nthe Puffins, but is often quite heavily blotched with brown. Size 2.70 ×\r\n1.80. Data.--Unak Is., Alaska, June 30, 1900. Egg laid in a fissure of\r\nthe rocks; no nest. Collector, F. Weston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 025: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 24\r\n\r\n16. CASSIN AUKLET. _Ptychoramphus aleuticus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast from Alaska to Lower California, breeding nearly\r\nthroughout its range.\r\n\r\nA plain appearing bird about 9 in. in length, with blackish upperparts\r\nrelieved only by a white spot over the eye; breast and throat gray and\r\nbelly white. This Auklet is fairly abundant on the Farallones, breeding\r\non the lower portions of the island. The late Mr. C. Barlow says that it\r\nis found in deserted rabbit burrows and in all probability often\r\nexcavates its own burrows. It also nests among the cliffs placing its\r\neggs among the rocks in any crevice or tunnel which may offer a dark\r\nretreat during the day for they are nocturnal in their habits. The\r\nsingle egg which they lay is dull white in color, the inside of the\r\nshell being a pale green, which color can only be seen by holding the\r\negg to the light. They are generally slightly nest stained. Size 1.80 ×\r\n1.30. Data.--Coronado Islands, Cal., March 23, 1897. Single egg laid on\r\nthe bare ground at end of a burrow three and one-half feet long.\r\nCollector, E. A. Shives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 026: Horned Puffin. Rhinoceros Auklet. Cassin Auklet.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n[Illustration: RHINOCEROS AUKLET. Color white, sometimes heavily\r\nblotched, as above, and again unspotted.]\r\n\r\nPage 25\r\n\r\n17. PAROQUET AUKLET.--_Phaleris psittacula._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Alaskan Coast, casually farther south in winter.\r\n\r\nThis bird is about the same size as the preceding, and the plumage is\r\nsimilar, except that it has no white spot over the eye, and the breast\r\nis white. It also has a slender plume extending from back of the eye.\r\nThe bill is very peculiar, being quite deep and rounded and having an\r\nupward tendency. It is orange red in color. They breed very commonly on\r\nthe islands of Bering Strait. Their eggs are laid in the crevices of the\r\ncliff, often several feet in and by a crooked path so that it is\r\nimpossible to reach them. The single chalky white egg is laid in May.\r\nSize 2.30 × 1.45. Data.--Rocky Islet in the Aleutians, June 22, 1890.\r\nSingle egg laid on bare rock in a deep crevice. Collector, Capt. S.\r\nWilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. CRESTED AUKLET. _Aethia cristatella._\r\n\r\nRange.--Alaska Coast, similar in form and plumage to the latter, except\r\nthat the whole under parts are gray and it has a crest of recurved\r\nfeathers. The nesting season begins in May, the birds nesting upon the\r\nsame islands and in the same kinds of sites as the last species. The\r\nsingle egg is chalky white. Size 2.10 × 1.50. Data.--Unak Is., Alaska,\r\nJuly 1, 1900. Egg laid in a crevice among the rocks. Collector, F.\r\nWeston.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. WHISKERED AUKLET. _Aethia pygmaea._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Alaska Coast.\r\n\r\nMuch smaller than the preceding; but 7.5 in. in length. Breast gray,\r\nbelly white; a small tuft of recurved feathers on the forehead and\r\nslender white plumes from base of bill over the eye and from under the\r\neye, backwards. The bill in summer is a bright vermillion color. On some\r\nof the islands of the Aleutian chain they breed quite abundantly. The\r\nnests are placed back in the crevices of the rocks, where the single\r\nwhite eggs are laid. Size 2.00 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 027: Paroquet Auklet. Crested Auklet.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 26\r\n\r\n20. LEAST AUKLET. _Aethia pusilla._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific on the islands and coast of Alaska. This is the\r\nsmallest of the Auklets; length 6.5 in. This species has no crest, but\r\nhas the slender white plumes extending back from the eye. The entire\r\nunder parts are white sparsely spotted with dusky. This species is by\r\nfar the most abundant of the water birds of the extreme Northwest, and\r\nthousands of them, accompanied by the two preceding species, nest on the\r\nrocky cliffs of the islands of Bering Sea. Their nesting habits are the\r\nsame as those of the other Auklets, they placing their single white egg\r\non the bare rocks, in crevices on the cliffs. Size 1.55 × 1.10.\r\nData.--Pribilof Is., Alaska, June 8, 1897. Single egg laid in crevice.\r\nThousands breeding on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. ANCIENT MURRELET. _Synthliboramphus antiquus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast, breeding from the border of the United States,\r\nnorthward, and wintering south to southern California.\r\n\r\nThe Murrelets have no crests or plumes and the bills are more slender\r\nthan the Auklets and are not highly colored. The ancient Murrelet or\r\nBlack-throated Murrelet, as it is also called, has a gray back, white\r\nunder parts and a black head and throat, with a broad white stripe back\r\nof the eye and another formed by the white on the breast extending up on\r\nthe side of the neck. They breed abundantly on the islands in Bering\r\nSea, laying one or two eggs at the end of burrows in the banks or on the\r\nground, and in some localities in crevices on the cliffs. The eggs are a\r\nbuffy white color and are faintly marked with light brown, some of these\r\nbeing in the shape of spots and others lengthened. Size 2.40 × 1.40.\r\nData.--Sanak Islands, July 1, 1894. Two eggs on the ground under a tuft\r\nof grass and in a slight excavation lined with fine grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Least Auklet. Ancient Murrelet. Marbled Murrelet.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 27\r\n\r\n23. MARBLED MURRELET. _Brachyramphus marmoratus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific Coast, breeding from Vancouver Island. South in\r\nwinter to southern California.\r\n\r\nIn the breeding plumage, this bird is brownish black above, barred with\r\nrusty and below is marbled with brownish gray and white. Its nesting\r\nhabits and eggs are very similar to those of the Ancient Murrelet, they\r\nplacing their single eggs in holes in the ground or crevices among the\r\ncliffs. Size 2.20 × 1.40. Data.--Chichagof Is., Alaska, June 18, 1898.\r\nSingle egg in crevice on face of cliff. Large colony breeding in company\r\nwith Ancient Murrelets.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. KITTLITZ MURRELET. _Brachyramphus brevirostris._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific Coast in the Aleutian Islands and north to\r\nUnalaska, breeding on isolated islands throughout its range. This\r\nspecies is very similar to the Marbled Murrelet, the chief difference\r\nbeing in the bill which is shorted. They have been found breeding on the\r\nsame islands with the preceding species. Their single white egg is laid\r\nin crevices in the cliffs. Size 2.40 × 1.30. Data.--Sanak Is., Alaska,\r\nJune 25, 1890. Nest in a hollow under a bunch of rank matted grass. Many\r\nancient Burrelets breeding on the same Islands. Collector, Capt. Tilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. XANTUS MURRELET. _Brachyramphus hypoleucus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Resident along the coast of southern and Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis bird is blackish above and entirely white below, including the\r\nsides of the head below the eye. The whole of the under surface of the\r\nwing is also white. They breed on the coast islands from Santa Barbara\r\nsouthward. The single egg is laid at the end of a burrow or in crevices\r\namong the rocks. It is a pale buffy white in color and thickly, but\r\nfinely dotted over the whole surface with purplish brown, and with some\r\nlarger spots at the larger end. Size 2.05 × 1.40. Data.--Galapagos\r\nIslands, March 2, 1901. No nest. Single egg laid in a crevice in the\r\nrocks. Collector, Rollo H. Beck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 029: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale Blue.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 28\r\n\r\n26. CRAVERI'S MURRELET. _Brachyramphus craveri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Both coasts of Lower California, breeding chiefly on the Gulf\r\nside. Craveri Murrelet is very similar to the last except that the under\r\nsurfaces of the wings are dusky. Breeds on the islands near Cape St.\r\nLucas, burrowing in the ground as do most of the others of this species.\r\nThey lay a single egg, the ground color of which is buff; they are quite\r\nheavily blotched with brownish. Size 2.00 × 1.40.\r\n\r\n27. BLACK GUILLEMOT. _Cepphus grylle._\r\n\r\n\r\nRange.--Coasts and islands of the North Atlantic, breeding from Maine\r\nnorthward to southern Greenland. Guillemots are larger birds than the\r\nMurrelets (length 13 inches) and their plumage is entirely different.\r\nThis species in summer is entirely black except the wing coverts which\r\nare white. The bases of the greater coverts, however, are black, this\r\ngenerally breaking the white mirror as it is called. The under surfaces\r\nof the wings are white. Legs red. These birds breed abundantly on the\r\nrocky islands and high cliffs along the coast. Soon after the first of\r\nJune the eggs are laid in the crevices of the rocks and sometimes upon\r\nthe bare ledges. Two or three eggs make the set. The ground color is a\r\npale bluish or greenish white and the markings are various shades of\r\nbrown and black. Size 2.40 × 1.60. Data.--Grand Manan, June 15, 1896.\r\nTwo eggs laid in a cavity back of large boulder. No nest. Collector, D.\r\nH. Eaton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 030: Xantus Murrelet. Mandt's Guillemot.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Black Guillemot.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 29\r\n\r\n28. MANDT'S GUILLEMOT. _Cepphus mandti._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic coast, more northerly than the preceding,\r\nbreeding from Labrador to northern Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe bird differs from the Black Guillemot only in having the bases of\r\nthe coverts white also. The nesting habits and eggs are identical. They\r\nnest in colonies of thousands and place the eggs upon the bare rock with\r\nno attempt at nest building. Generally the eggs are in the crevices so\r\nas to be difficult to get at. Size 2.30 × 1.55. Data.--Depot Island,\r\nHudson Bay, June 6, 1894. Two eggs laid on bare rocky ground. Collector\r\nJohn Comer.\r\n\r\n\r\n29. PIGEON GUILLEMOT. _Cepphus columba._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Pacific Coast of North America, breeding from southern\r\nCalifornia northward. This bird is very similar to the Black Guillemot\r\nexcept that the under surfaces of the wings are dark. They breed\r\nabundantly on some of the islands of Bering Sea and a few of them nest\r\non the Farallones. They lay their two eggs on the bare rock in dark\r\ncrevices. The color is grayish or pale greenish blue and the markings\r\nare brown and black with paler shell markings of lilac. Size 2.40 ×\r\n1.60. Data.--S. Farallone Islands, Cal. Two eggs laid on gravel at the\r\nend of a burrow, about two feet from the entrance and 285 feet above the\r\nsea level. Collector, Claude Fyfe.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. MURRE. _Uria troile troille._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic coasts and islands, breeding from Bird Rock\r\nnorthward. Murres are similar in form to the Guillemots, but are larger,\r\nbeing about 16 inches in length. Entire head and neck sooty brown; rest\r\nof upper parts grayish black except the tips of the secondaries which\r\nare white. Under parts white. These birds nest by thousands on Bird Rock\r\nand on the cliffs of Labrador. They build no nests but simply lay their\r\nsingle egg on the narrow ledges of cliffs, where the only guarantee\r\nagainst its rolling off is its peculiar shape which causes it, when\r\nmoved, to revolve about its smaller end instead of rolling off the\r\nledge. The eggs are laid as closely as possible on the ledges where the\r\nincubating birds sit upright, in long rows like an army on guard. As\r\nlong as each bird succeeds in finding an egg to cover, on its return\r\nhome, it is doubtful if they either know or care whether it is their own\r\nor not. The ground color of the eggs vary from white to a deep greenish\r\nblue and the markings of blackish brown vary in endless patterns, some\r\neggs being almost wholly unspotted. Size 3.40 × 2.00. Data.--South\r\nLabrador, June 19, 1884. Single egg laid on the bare cliff. Large colony\r\nbreeding. Collector, M. A. Grasar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 031: Murre.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale bluish gray.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 30\r\n\r\n30a. CALIFORNIA MURRE. _Uria troille californica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast, breeding from the Farallones north to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis Pacific form of the common Murre is the most abundant breeding bird\r\non the Farallones. Their eggs are used in enormous numbers for\r\ncommercial purposes and these islands being located, as they are, within\r\neasy distance from San Francisco, thousands of dozens of the eggs are\r\nsold yearly, chiefly to bakeries. Although continually robbed, their\r\nnumbers have not as yet diminished to any great extent. They lay but a\r\nsingle egg on the bare ledge. Individual eggs are indistinguishable from\r\nthe last species but in a large series the ground color averages\r\nbrighter. They show the same great difference in color and markings. The\r\nfirst set is laid in May, but owing to their being so often molested,\r\nfresh eggs can be found during August. Data.--Farallones, July 4, 1895.\r\nSingle egg laid on bare cliff. Collector, Thos. E. Slevin.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. BRUNNICH MURRE. _Uria lomvia lomvia._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic Coast, breeding range the same as the common\r\nMurre.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from the common Murre in having a shorter and\r\nthicker bill, the base of the cutting edge of which is less feathered.\r\nThey breed on the same islands in company with the common Murre and\r\ntheir eggs are indistinguishable. Data.--Coast of South Labrador. Single\r\negg laid on ledge of cliff. About three hundred birds in the colony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 032: Varies from white to greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 31\r\n\r\n31a. PALLAS MURRE. _Uria lomvia arra._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Pacific coasts and islands.\r\n\r\nThis is the Pacific form of Brunnich Murre. Its breeding range is more\r\nnortherly than that of the California variety. Countless thousands of\r\nthem breed on the islands off the coast of Alaska, their breeding habits\r\nand eggs being the same as the more southern form.\r\n\r\n\r\n32. RAZOR-BILLED AUK. _Alca torda._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic coast, breeding from Bird Rock northward and\r\nwintering south to the Middle States on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe Razor-billed Auk is in form similar to the Murres, but the bill is\r\nvery different, being deep and thin, and with the upper mandible rounded\r\nat the tip. Entire upper parts black shading to brownish on the throat.\r\nUnder parts and tips of secondaries, white; line from eye to bill and\r\nanother across the middle of the bill, white. They nest in large numbers\r\non Bird Rock in company with the Murres and in still greater numbers off\r\nthe coast of Labrador. Their eggs are not placed in as exposed positions\r\nas the Murres, being generally behind boulders or in crevices. This is\r\nnecessary because, not being of the pear-shaped form of the Murres, they\r\nwould be very apt to be dislodged if commonly placed on the narrow\r\nledges. The eggs vary endlessly in marking but do not show the\r\ndifferences in ground color that the Murres do. The color is white,\r\ngrayish or buffy. But one egg is generally laid, although two are\r\nsometimes found. Size 3.00 × 2.00. Data.--Bay of Fundy. June 17, 1891.\r\nSingle egg laid on bare rock in a crevice under loose rocks. Collector,\r\nA. C. Bent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 033: Grayish white.] [Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 32\r\n\r\n33. GREAT AUK. _Plautus impennis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Formerly the whole of the North Atlantic coasts. Now extinct.\r\n\r\nThese great auks formerly dwelt in large numbers on the islands of the\r\nNorth Atlantic, but owing to their lack of the powers of flight and the\r\ndestructiveness of mankind, the living bird has disappeared from the\r\nface of the earth. Although they were about thirty inches in length,\r\ntheir wings were even smaller than those of the Razor-billed Auk, a bird\r\nonly eighteen inches in length. Although breeding off the coast of\r\nNewfoundland, they appeared winters as far south as Virginia, performing\r\ntheir migration by swimming alone. The last bird appears to have been\r\ntaken in 1844, and Funk Island, off the coast of Newfoundland, marks the\r\nplace of their disappearance from our shores. There are about seventy\r\nknown specimens of the bird preserved, and about the same number of\r\neggs. The immediate cause of the extinction of these birds was their\r\ndestruction for food by fishermen and immigrants, and later for the use\r\nof their feathers commercially. The single egg that they laid was about\r\n5.00 x 3.00 inches, the ground color was buffy white, and the spots\r\nbrownish and blackish. The markings varied in endless pattern as do\r\nthose of the smaller Auk. There are but two real eggs (plaster casts in\r\nimitation of the Auks eggs are to be found in many collections) in\r\ncollections in this country, one in the Academy of Natural Science,\r\nPhiladelphia, and the other in the National Museum, at Washington.\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Academy of Natural\r\nScience, we are enabled to show a full-sized reproduction from a\r\nphotograph of the egg in their collection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 034: Great Auk Dovekie.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n\r\nPage 33\r\n\r\n[Illustration 035: EGG OF THE GREAT AUK.\r\nPhotographed from the specimen in the Academy of Natural Science,\r\nPhiladelphia; not more than ten or twelve of these eggs are in this\r\ncountry; the one figured is one of the best marked specimens.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 34\r\n\r\n34. DOVEKIE. _Alle alle_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Coasts and islands of the North Atlantic and East Arctic oceans,\r\nbreeding in the Arctic regions and wintering as far south as the Middle\r\nStates. The little Dovekie or Sea Dove is the smallest member of the\r\nfamily, being only 8 inches in length, and is the only member of the\r\nsub-family allinæ. The form is very robust and the bill is short and\r\nstout. In summer the plumage is black above; the throat and upper breast\r\nare sooty brown, and the under parts are white, as are also the tips of\r\nthe secondaries and edges of the scapulars. They nest in large numbers\r\non the Rocky cliffs of islands in the East Arctic. Their single pale\r\ngreenish blue egg is placed in a crevice of the rocks. Size 1.80 × 1.25.\r\nData.--Greenland, June 8, 1893. Single egg laid in a crevice of a sea\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration 036: Dovekie.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: MURRE--White, buff, or deep greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 35\r\n\r\nLONG-WINGED SWIMMERS. Order II. LONGIPENNES\r\nSKUA AND JAEGERS. Family STERCORARIIDAE\r\n\r\nSkuas and Jægers are birds having a Gull or Tern-like form and with a\r\nhooked bill, the base of which is covered with a scaly shield. They have\r\nwebbed feet and are able to swim and dive, but they commonly get their\r\nliving by preying upon the Gulls and Terns, overtaking them by their\r\nsuperior speed and by their strength and ferocity forcing them to\r\nrelinquish their food. The Jægers especially are one of the swiftest and\r\nmost graceful birds that fly.\r\n\r\nPage 36\r\n\r\n35. SKUA. _Megalestris skua_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Coasts and islands of the North Atlantic, chiefly on the\r\nEuropean side; rare on the Atlantic coast of North America.\r\n\r\nSkuas are large (22 inches in length) and very powerfully built birds,\r\nhaving the general form of a Gull. Their whole plumage is a dingy\r\nbrownish black color, palest below. Breeds in Iceland and possibly on\r\nsome of the islands in Hudson Strait. The nest is a hollow on the ground\r\nin the marsh grass and is lined with grass. The two eggs which they lay\r\nhave an olive greenish ground, spotted with dark brown. Size 2.75 ×\r\n1.90.\r\n\r\n\r\n36. POMARINE JAEGER. _Stercorarius pomarinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding within the Arctic Circle, more\r\ncommonly in the Old World.\r\n\r\nIn the breeding plumage, this Jæger has the crown and face blackish;\r\nback and sides of head, throat and under parts pure white, except the\r\npointed stiffened feathers of the neck which are yellow. Back, wings and\r\ntail blackish, the latter with the two middle feathers lengthened about\r\nfour inches beyond the rest of the tail, and broad to the tips, which\r\nare twisted so that the feathers are vertical. They breed throughout the\r\nArctic regions, but not as commonly in America as the following species.\r\nThe nest is on the ground in the marsh grass and is made of grass and\r\nmoss. They lay two and rarely three eggs of an olive brown or greenish\r\ncolor. These are spotted with brown and black. Size 2.20 × 1.70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 038: Olive brown.]\r\n[Illustration: Skua. Pomarine Jæger.]\r\n[Illustration: Deep olive brown.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 37\r\n\r\n37. PARASITIC JAEGER. _Stercorarius parasiticus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, wintering south to South America.\r\n\r\nThe Parasitic Jæger is very similar to the Pomarine except that the\r\ncentral tail feathers are pointed and are straight instead of twisted.\r\nIt is an abundant bird in Alaska, breeding from the Aleutian Chain\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nThey locate their nests in the highest parts of marshy places, the nest\r\nitself being only a depression in the ground lined with grass and moss.\r\nThe two eggs have an olive greenish or brownish ground and are marked\r\nwith various shades of brown and black. Size 2.15 × 1.65.\r\n\r\n\r\n38. LONG-TAILED JAEGER. _Stercorarius longicaudus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic America; south in winter to South America.\r\n\r\nThe long-tailed Jæger is, according to length, the largest of the\r\nJægers, being 21 in. long; this is, however, due to the long sharp\r\npointed central pair of tail feathers, which extend about eight inches\r\nbeyond the others, and from the most noticeable distinguishing point\r\nfrom the former species. The plumages that have been described are the\r\nlight phases; all the Jægers have a dark phase in which the plumage is a\r\nnearly uniform sooty brown, lightest below.\r\n\r\nThe Long-tailed Jægers are the most numerous in Alaska and are even more\r\ngraceful in flight than are the Gulls and Terns, floating, skimming,\r\nsailing, plunging, and darting about with incredible swiftness and ease.\r\nLike the others of this family, they pilfer their food from the Gulls,\r\nand are also very destructive to young birds and eggs. Their eggs are\r\neither laid on the bare ground or in a slight depression, scantily lined\r\nwith grasses. The eggs are indistinguishable from those of the preceding\r\nspecies except that they average a trifle smaller. Size 2.10 × 1.50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 039: Brownish.]\r\n[Illustration: Parastic Jæger. Long-tailed Jæger.]\r\n[Illustration: Olive brown.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 38\r\n\r\nGULLS and TERNS. Family LARIDÆ\r\n\r\nGulls are webbed footed birds having a slight hook to the end of the\r\nupper mandible. Their plumage is generally a silvery gray above and\r\nwhite below. They nest in large colonies, some on the islands of fresh\r\nwater inland, but mostly on the sea coast. They procure their food from\r\nthe surface of the water, it consisting mostly of dead fish and refuse\r\nmatter, and crustacea which they gather from the waters edge. When tired\r\nthey rest upon the surface of the water, where they ride the largest\r\nwaves in perfect safety.\r\n\r\nTerns are birds of similar plumage to the Gulls, but their forms are\r\nless robust and the bills are generally longer and sharply pointed.\r\nTheir food consists chiefly of small fish which they secure by hovering\r\nabove the water, and then plunging upon them. They are less often seen\r\non the surface of the water than are the Gulls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 040: Walter Raine. CHARACTERISTIC NEST OF A LOON.]\r\n[Illustration: Left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 39\r\n\r\n39. IVORY GULL. _Pagophila alba._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions; south in winter to the northern border of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe little Snow Gull, as it is often called, is eighteen inches in\r\nlength. In the breeding season the plumage is entirely white; the bill\r\nis tipped with yellow and there is a red ring around the eye. These\r\nGulls nest in large colonies in the Arctic Regions, placing their nests\r\non the high rocky cliffs. The nest is made of grass, moss and rubbish,\r\nand the three eggs are laid during June. The eggs are olive color and\r\nthe markings are dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n40. KITTIWAKE. _Rissa tridactyla trydactyla._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic and Arctic regions, breeding from the Gulf of the\r\nSt. Lawrence northward and wintering south to the Great Lakes and Long\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe Kittiwake is sixteen inches in length, has a pearly gray mantle,\r\nblack tips to the primaries, and remainder of plumage white. Its hind\r\ntoe is very small being apparently wanting in the eastern form, while in\r\nthe Pacific it is more developed. These are very noisy Gulls, their\r\nnotes resembling a repetition of their name. They are very common in the\r\nfar north, placing nests on the ledges of high rocky cliffs, often in\r\ncompany with Murres and Auks. They gather together a pile of sticks,\r\ngrass and moss, making the interior cup-shaped so as to hold their two\r\nor three eggs. Large numbers of them breed on Bird Rock, they occupying\r\ncertain ledges while the Gannets and Murres, which also breed there,\r\nalso have distinct ledges on which to make their homes. The breeding\r\nseason is at its height during June. The eggs are buffy or brownish gray\r\nand are spotted with different shades of brown. Size 2.25 × 1.60.\r\nData.--So. Labrador, June 15, 1884. Three eggs. Nest made of seaweed and\r\nmoss, placed on ledge of cliff. Many Murres nesting on other ledges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 041: Ivory Gull. Kittiwake.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 40\r\n\r\n40a. PACIFIC KITTIWAKE. _Rissa tridactyla pollicaris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of the North Pacific, wintering south to California.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Kittiwake breeds in immense rookeries on some of the islands\r\nin Bering Sea. They are well distributed over Copper Island where they\r\nnest in June and July, choosing the high ledges which overhang the sea.\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs are precisely the same as those of the\r\ncommon Kittiwake.\r\n\r\n\r\n41. RED-LEGGED KITTIWAKE. _Rissa brevirostris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern coasts, breeding in high latitudes.\r\n\r\nThis Kittiwake is similar to the preceding, with the exception that the\r\nlegs are bright red, the mantle is darker, and the bill is shorter. This\r\nspecies was found by Dr. Leonard Stejneger to be a very abundant nesting\r\nbird on islands in Bering Sea, selecting steep and inaccessible rocks\r\nand ledges on which to build its nest. Their nesting habits are\r\nprecisely the same as the Pacific Kittiwake, but they most often nest in\r\nseparate colonies, but can be distinguished readily when nesting\r\ntogether by the darker mantles when on the nest and the red legs when\r\nflying. Grass, moss and mud are used in the nest. The ground color of\r\nthe eggs is buffy or brownish, and the spots are dark brown and lilac.\r\nSize 2.15 × 1.50.\r\n\r\n\r\n42. GLAUCOUS GULL. _Larus hyperboreus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions, south in winter to Long Island, the Great Lakes,\r\nand San Francisco Bay.\r\n\r\nThis Gull shares with the Great Black-backed Gull the honor of being the\r\nlargest of the Gulls, being 28 inches in length. Mantle light gray; it\r\nis distinguished by its size and the primaries, which are white to the\r\ntips. A powerful bird that preys upon the smaller Gulls and also devours\r\nthe young and eggs of smaller birds.\r\n\r\nThey nest on the ground on the islands and shores of Hudson Bay,\r\nGreenland, etc. The nest is made of seaweed, grass and moss and is\r\ngenerally quite bulky. The two or three eggs are laid in June. They are\r\nof various shades of color from a light drab to a brownish, and are\r\nspotted with brownish and black. Size about 3.00 × 2.20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 042: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Red-legged Kittiwake. Glaucous Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 41\r\n\r\n42.1. POINT BARROW GULL. _Larus barrovianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwest coast from Bering Sea to Point Barrow.\r\n\r\nThis species is almost identical with the Glaucus Gull, averaging\r\nperhaps a trifle smaller. Its standing as a distinct species is still\r\nquestioned and has not yet been decided satisfactorily. Early in June\r\ntheir nests are built on remote islands in Bering Sea. These nests are\r\nthe same as the last species, large piles of vegetation, hollowed on top\r\nfor the reception of the eggs. The eggs have the same variations in\r\ncolor and markings as the Glaucus Gull. Size 3.00 × 2.10.\r\nData.--Herschel Is., Alaska, July 1, 1900. Nest made of seaweed and\r\ngrass; placed on the ground. Three eggs. Collector, Rev. I. O. Stringer.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. ICELAND GULL. _Larus leucopterus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions, south in winter to the Middle States.\r\n\r\nThis Gull in appearance is precisely like the two preceding ones but is\r\nconsiderably smaller; 24 inches in length. A very common bird in the\r\nnorth, breeding in colonies of thousands on many of the islands. It is\r\nregarded as one of the most common of the larger Gulls in Bering Sea and\r\nalso nests commonly in Hudson Bay and Greenland, as well as in the\r\nEastern Hemisphere. They nest indifferently on high rocky cliffs or on\r\nlow sandy islands. Except when the eggs are laid in a sandy depression\r\nin the soil, quite bulky nests are made of seaweed and moss. The eggs\r\nare laid about the first of June; they number two to three and have a\r\nground color of brownish or greenish brown and are blotched with umber.\r\nSize 2.80 × 1.83. Data.--Mackenzie Bay, Arctic America. June 18, 1899.\r\nNest made of seaweed and grass on an island in the bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 42\r\n\r\n44. GLAUCOUS-WINGED GULL. _Larus glaucescens_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific coast, breeding from British Columbia northwards\r\nand wintering from the same country to southern California.\r\n\r\nThis Gull is very like the preceding except that the primaries are the\r\nsame color as the mantle, and are tipped with white. Length about 27\r\ninches. Not so northerly distributed a bird as the previous ones, and\r\nconsequently better known. They breed in large numbers both on the high\r\nrocky cliffs of the islands along the coast and on the low sandy islands\r\nof the Aleutian Chain. On Copper Island they breed on the inaccessible\r\ncliffs overhanging the water. As in the case of the Iceland Gull, when\r\nthe nests are on the cliffs, a large nest of seaweed is made, whereas if\r\nthey are on the ground, especially in sandy places no attempt is made at\r\nnest-building. The eggs have a greenish brown ground color and dark\r\nbrown spots. Size 2.75 × 2.05. Data.--West Coast of Vancouver Island.\r\nJune 20, 1896. Three eggs; nest made of seaweed. Located on a low ledge.\r\nCollector, Dr. Newcombe.\r\n\r\n\r\n45. KUMLIEN'S GULL. _Larus Kumlieni_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic coast, breeding in Cumberland Sound and wintering\r\nas far south as Long Island.\r\n\r\nThis bird differs from the Glaucous-winged only in the pattern of the\r\ngray markings of the primaries and in having a little lighter mantle. It\r\nis quite common in its breeding haunts where it places its nest high up\r\non the ledges of the cliffs. The eggs are not different apparently from\r\nglaucescens.\r\n\r\n\r\n46. NELSON'S GULL. _Larus nelsoni_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of Alaska.\r\n\r\nPlumage exactly like that of Kumlien Gull and questionably a new\r\nspecies. The nests and eggs are not to be distinguished from the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 044: Iceland Gull. Glaucous-winged Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale greenish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 43\r\n\r\n47. GREAT BLACK-BACKED GULL. _Larus marinus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic on both the American and European sides; breeds\r\nfrom Nova Scotia northward and winters south to the Great Lakes and the\r\nMiddle States.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the Gulls (thirty inches long) and unlike any other. The\r\nmantle is dark slaty black, and the primaries are black with white tips.\r\nThe bill is very large and powerful and quite strongly hooked. They are\r\nquite abundant birds in their range, and are very quarrelsome, both\r\namong themselves and other species. They do not breed in as large\r\ncolonies as do the other Gulls, half a dozen pairs appropriating a small\r\nisland to the exclusion of all other birds. They are very rapacious\r\nbirds and live to a great extent, especially during the breeding season,\r\nupon the eggs and young of other birds such as Ducks, Murres and smaller\r\nGulls. They place their nests upon the higher portions of sandy islands.\r\nThey are made of grasses and seaweed. The three eggs are laid early in\r\nJune; they are grayish or brownish, spotted with brown and lilac. Size\r\n3.00 × 2.15. Data.--South Labrador, June 21, 1884. Three eggs. Nest on a\r\nsmall island off the coast; of grasses and moss.\r\n\r\n\r\n48. SLATY-BACKED GULL.--_Larus schistisagus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific and Arctic Oceans.\r\n\r\nThis Gull, which is similar to the Great Black-backed, but is smaller\r\nand has a lighter mantle, does not breed in any considerable numbers on\r\nthe American side of the Pacific. It nests in June on some of the\r\nislands in Bering Sea and probably more commonly farther north. They\r\noften nest in company with other species, placing their small mounds of\r\nseaweed on the ground on the higher parts of the islands. The full set\r\ncontains three eggs of grayish or brownish color, spotted with dark\r\nbrown or black. Size 2.90 × 2.00. Data.--Harrowby Bay, N. W. T. Canada,\r\nJune 11, 1901. Nest of grass, roots and mud and lined with dry grass; on\r\npoint making into the bay. Collector, Capt. H. H. Bodfish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 045: Great Black-Backed Gull. Kumlien's Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 44\r\n\r\n49. WESTERN GULL. _Larus occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast, breeding from southern California to British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThis bird, which is the most southerly distributed of the larger Gulls\r\nis twenty-four inches in length. Mantle slate colored; primaries black,\r\nboth these and the secondaries being broadly tipped with white. These\r\nGulls nest abundantly on the Farallones, the majority of them showing a\r\npreference for the lower portions of the island, although they nest on\r\nthe ledges also. Besides man, these Gulls are the greatest enemies that\r\nthe Murres have to content against. They are always on the watch and if\r\na Murre leaves its nest, one of the Gulls is nearly always ready to\r\npounce upon the egg and carry it away bodily in his bill. The Gulls too\r\nsuffer when the eggers come, for their eggs are gathered up with the\r\nMurres for the markets. They make their nests of weeds and grass, and\r\nduring May and June lay three eggs showing the usual variations of color\r\ncommon to the Gulls eggs. Size 2.75 × 1.90.\r\n\r\n\r\n50. SIBERIAN GULL. _Larus affinis._\r\n\r\nThis bird does not nest in North America, and has a place on our list,\r\nby its accidental occurrence in Greenland. It is an Old World species\r\nand its nesting habits and eggs are like those of the Herring Gull.\r\n\r\n\r\n51. HERRING GULL. _Larus argentatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of the Northern Hemisphere, breeding from Maine and\r\nBritish Columbia northward and wintering south to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nThis Gull, which formerly was No. 51a, a subspecies of the European\r\nvariety, is now regarded as identical with it, and is no longer a\r\nsub-species. It is twenty-four inches in length, has a light gray mantle\r\nand black primaries which are tipped with white. The Herring Gulls nest\r\nin colonies in favorable localities throughout their range, chiefly on\r\nthe coasts and islands. A few pairs also nest on islands in some of the\r\ninland bodies of fresh water. Except in places where they are\r\ncontinually molested, when they will build in trees, they place their\r\nnests on the ground either making no nest on the bare sand, or building\r\na bulky nest of seaweed in the grass on higher parts of the island. They\r\nlay three eggs of a grayish color marked with brown. In rare cases\r\nunspotted bluish white eggs are found. Size 2.80 × 1.70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 046: Western Gull. Herring Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 45\r\n\r\n52. VEGA GULL. _Larus vegae._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of Alaska, south in winter to California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Herring Gull, but with the mantle darker, but not so dark\r\nas in the Western Gull. The nesting habits and eggs are the same as\r\nthose of the Herring Gull, except that in a series, the eggs of the Vega\r\nwill average a little darker in ground color. It nests during May on the\r\ncoasts and islands of Bering Sea, placing its eggs in a hollow on the\r\nground. Size 2.75 × 1.65.\r\n\r\n\r\n53. CALIFORNIA GULL. _Larus californicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, breeding in the interior.\r\n\r\nA smaller Gull than the Herring with the primaries grayish instead of\r\nblack; length twenty-five inches. This Gull is found in winter on the\r\ncoast from British Columbia southward to Lower California, but nests in\r\nthe interior from Utah northward. They nest very abundantly around the\r\nGreat Salt Lake, placing their nests generally upon the bare ground.\r\nSometimes there is a scant lining of grasses or weeds and again the\r\nnests will be situated in the midst of a tussock of grass. Three or four\r\neggs generally constitute a set, but occasionally five are laid. The\r\nusual nesting time is during May. They show the same great variations in\r\ncolor and markings common to most of the Gulls. Size 2.60 × 1.80.\r\n\r\n\r\n54. RING-BILLED GULL. _Larus delawarenis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding from the United States\r\nnorthward and wintering south to the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nA small Gull, eighteen inches in length, with a light gray mantle, black\r\nprimaries with white tips, and always to be distinguished in the\r\nbreeding season by the black band around the middle of the greenish\r\nyellow bill. They nest in enormous colonies on islands in the interior\r\nof the country and in smaller colonies on the coasts. Thousands of them\r\nbreed on the lakes of the Dakotas and northward. The majority of them\r\nnest on the ground, although on the coast they are often found on the\r\ncliffs. They commonly lay three eggs placing them in a slight hollow in\r\nthe ground, generally on the grassy portions of the islands. The color\r\nvaries from grayish to brownish, marked with brown and lilac. The height\r\nof the nesting season is in June. Size of eggs, 2.80 × 1.75.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 047: Grayish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: Ring-billed Gull. California Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 46\r\n\r\n55. SHORT-BILLED GULL. _Larus brachyrhynchus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds from the interior of British Columbia northward to\r\nAlaska; south in winter to Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe Short-billed or American Mew Gull is seventeen inches in length, has\r\na short, stout bill and is otherwise similar to the preceding species.\r\nNests on islands in the lakes and along the river banks of Alaska. The\r\nnest is made of grass, weeds and moss and is placed on the ground. Early\r\nin June the birds lay their set of three eggs, the ground color of which\r\nis greenish brown marked with dark brown. Size 2.25 × 1.60.\r\nData.--Mackenzie River, N. W. T., June 18, 1900. Three eggs. Nest made\r\nof seaweed and grass and placed on the ground on an island in the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n56. MEW GULL. _Larus canus._\r\n\r\nThis is the European variety of the above species, breeding commonly\r\nboth in the British Isles and northern Europe. This species is given a\r\nplace in our avifauna because of its accidental appearance in Labrador.\r\n\r\n\r\n57. HEERMAN'S GULL. _Larus heermanni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast of North America from British Columbia south to\r\nPanama, breeding chiefly south of the United States border.\r\n\r\nA very handsome species, often called the White-headed Gull, and wholly\r\nunlike any other; length seventeen inches. Adults, in summer, have the\r\nentire head, neck and throat white, this shading quite abruptly into the\r\nslaty upper and under parts; the primaries and tail are black, the\r\nlatter and the secondaries being tipped with white. The legs and bill\r\nare vermilion. They are found off the coast of California, but are not\r\nbelieved to breed there. They are known to breed on some of the islands\r\noff the Mexican coast nesting on the ground the same as the other\r\nspecies. The three eggs are greenish drab in color and are marked with\r\ndifferent shades of brown and lilac. Size 2.45 × 1.50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pale greenish-brown.]\r\n[Illustration: Short-billed Gull. Heerman's Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: Left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 47\r\n\r\n58. LAUGHING GULL. LARUS ATRICILLA.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from the Gulf to Nova Scotia,\r\nchiefly on the coast. A beautiful Gull, 16 inches long, with a dark\r\nslate colored head, gray mantle, black primaries, and white neck,\r\nunderparts and tail. Bill and feet red. This bird has its name from its\r\npeculiar laughing cry when alarmed or angry; it is also called the\r\nBlack-headed Gull. They nest by thousands on the islands off the Gulf\r\nCoast and along the South Atlantic States. The nest is placed on the\r\nground and is made of seaweed. Three, four and sometimes five eggs are\r\nlaid, of a grayish to greenish brown color, marked with brown and lilac.\r\nSize 2.25 × 1.60. Data.--Timbalin Is., La., June 3, 1896. Three eggs.\r\nNest of drift grass thrown in a pile about 8 inches high, slightly\r\nhollowed on top, in low marsh back of beach. Collector, E. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 049: Pale grayish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: Laughing Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: RING-BILLED GULL--Gray.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 48\r\n\r\n59. FRANKLIN'S GULL. _Larus franklini._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior North America, breeding from middle United States\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nLike the last but smaller and with the primaries light. Underparts rosy\r\nin breeding season. Nests very abundantly in the marshes of Minnesota\r\nand northward. Nest made of grasses and placed in the marsh grass barely\r\nabove the surface of the water. Eggs same color as the last but the\r\nmarkings more inclined to zigzag lines. Size 2.10 × 1.40. Data.--Heron\r\nLake, Minn., May 26, 1885. Nest of wet sedge stalks and rubbish placed\r\nin a bunch of standing sedge in shallow water; at least five thousand\r\nbirds in rookery. Collector, J. W. Preston.\r\n\r\n\r\n60. BONAPARTE'S GULL. _Larus philadelphia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the northern parts of North America; winters from\r\nMaine and British Columbia to the southern border of the United States.\r\n\r\nSmaller than the last; 14 inches long. Plumage similar, but bill slender\r\nand black. They nest in great numbers on the marshes of Manitoba and to\r\nthe northward. The nests, of sticks and grass, are placed on the higher\r\nparts of the marsh and the usual complement of three eggs is laid during\r\nthe latter part of June. The eggs are grayish to greenish brown, marked\r\nwith dark brown and lilac. Size 1.90 × 1.30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 050: Grayish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: Franklin's Gull. Bonaparte's Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale grayish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 49\r\n\r\n60.1. LITTLE GULL. _Larus minutus._\r\n\r\nThis Gull is the smallest of the family; it is a European bird, and has\r\naccidentally strayed to our shores but a few times. Its plumage is\r\nsimilar to that of the Bonaparte Gull but the bill is red. It breeds in\r\nthe marshes around the Baltic Sea, placing its nest of dead vegetation\r\non the highest parts of the marsh. They lay three eggs of a greenish\r\ngray color marked with dark brown and lilac. Size 1.75 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n61. ROSES GULL. _Rhodostethia rosea._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Arctic regions, south in winter to Alaska, Greenland,\r\nnorthern Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful bird is the most rare of all the Gulls, being very\r\ndifficult to obtain because of its extreme northerly distribution. It is\r\nin form and plumage like Bonaparte Gull, with the exceptions that the\r\nhead is white, there being a narrow black collar around the neck, the\r\ntail is wedge shaped, and the whole under parts from the chin to the\r\ntail are rosy in the breeding plumage. The nests and eggs remain still\r\nundiscovered, although Nansen, in August 1896, found a supposed breeding\r\nground in Franz Josef Land, because of the numbers of the birds, but\r\nfound no nests.\r\n\r\n\r\n62. SABINE'S GULL. _Xema sabinii._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions, breeding from Alaska and Greenland and\r\nnorthward, and wintering south to New England.\r\n\r\nA handsome bird, having the slaty hood bordered behind with a black\r\nring, the primaries black, white tipped, and the tail slightly forked.\r\nThey breed abundantly on the marshes of northern Alaska and Greenland,\r\nnesting the same as others of the species. The two or three eggs are\r\nlaid in June. They are greenish brown in color and are marked with dark\r\nbrown. Size 1.75 × 1.25. Data.--Hudson Bay, August 1, 1894. Eggs laid on\r\nthe ground in the moss; no nest except the hollow in the moss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 051: Rose Gull. Sabine Gull.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 50\r\n\r\n63. GULL-BILLED TERN. _Gelochelidon nilotica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Found in North America along the Gulf Coast and on the Atlantic\r\nCoast north to Virginia and casually farther.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the largest of the Terns, is 14 inches long, has a short,\r\nthick, black bill and a short slightly forked tail; the crown is black,\r\nmantle pearly gray, white below. This species is very widely\r\ndistributed, being found in Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. They are\r\nknown locally as \"Marsh Terns\" where they breed in immense numbers on\r\nsome of the marshes about the Gulf, particularly in Texas. They also\r\nbreed on many of the islands along the Coast, rarely making any nest,\r\nbut laying the eggs in a hollow in the sand. They nest most abundantly\r\nin the latter part of May, generally laying three eggs. They are of a\r\nyellowish, grayish or greenish buff color and are spotted with brown and\r\nlilac. Size 1.80 × 1.30. Data.--Northampton Co., Va., May 28, 1882.\r\nThree eggs laid on a mass of seaweed on marsh above tide water.\r\n\r\n\r\n64. CASPIAN TERN. _Sterna caspia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Like the preceding species, this bird is nearly cosmopolitan in\r\nits range, in North America breeding from the Gulf Coast and Texas\r\nnorthward to the Arctic Regions.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful bird is the largest of the Tern family, being about 22\r\ninches in length, with the tail forked about 1.5 inches. The bill is\r\nlarge, heavy and bright red; the crest, with which this and the next\r\nthree species are adorned, is black. The mantle is pale pearl and the\r\nunder parts white. These Terns sometimes nest in large colonies and then\r\nagain only a few pairs will be found on an island. In Texas, the\r\nbreeding season commences in May, it being later in the more northern\r\nbreeding grounds. They may be regarded as largely eastern birds, as\r\nwhile they are common in the interior of the country, they are rarely\r\nfound on the Pacific Coast. Two or three eggs constitute a complete set;\r\nthese are laid on the sand in a slight hollow scooped out by the birds.\r\nThey vary from gray to greenish buff, marked with brown and lilac. Size\r\n2.60 × 1.75. Data.--Hat Island, Lake Michigan, July 1, 1896. No nest.\r\nTwo eggs in a hollow in the gravel. Fully a thousand terns nesting on\r\nabout one acre. Collector, Charles L. Cass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 052: Pale greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 51\r\n\r\n65. ROYAL TERN. _Sterna maxima._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North and South America, breeding in the United States\r\nlocally from Texas and the Gulf States northward to the northern\r\nboundary of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Terns nest in great numbers on the coasts and islands on the\r\nSouth Atlantic and Gulf States and in the marshes of southern Texas.\r\nLike the former species they lay two or three eggs in a hollow on the\r\nbare sand. The eggs are the same size but differ in being more pointed\r\nand having a lighter ground and with the markings more bold and\r\ndistinct. Size 2.60 × 1.70.\r\n\r\n\r\n66. ELEGANT TERN. _Sterna elegans._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast of South and Central America; north to California\r\nin summer.\r\n\r\nA similar bird to the Royal Tern, but easily distinguished by its\r\nsmaller size, slender bill, and more graceful form. In the breeding\r\nplumage the under parts of these Terns are tinged with rosy, which\r\nprobably first gave the birds their name. They breed on the coasts and\r\nislands of Mexico and Central America, placing their eggs on the sand.\r\nThey are believed to lay but a single egg, like that of the Royal Tern,\r\nbut smaller. Size 2.40 × 1.40. Data.--Honduras, Central America, June 5,\r\n1899. Single egg laid on the sandy beach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 053: Gull-billed Tern. Caspian Tern. Royal Tern.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Cream color.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 52\r\n\r\n67. CABOT TERN. _Sterna sandvicensis acuflavida._\r\n\r\nRange.--A tropical species breeding regularly north to the Bahamas and\r\nFlorida; casually farther north. A beautiful bird distinguished from the\r\nthree preceding ones by its smaller size (sixteen inches) and by the\r\nbill which is black with a yellow tip. They nest in colonies on the\r\nshores of islands in the West Indies and Bahamas, but not to a great\r\nextent on the United States Coast. Their two or three eggs have a creamy\r\nground color, and are boldly marked with brown and black. Size 2.10 ×\r\n1.40.\r\n\r\n\r\n68. TRUDEAU'S TERN. _Sterna trudeaui._\r\n\r\nRange.--South America; accidentally along the coast of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA rare and unique species with a form similar to the following, but with\r\nthe coloration entirely different. About fifteen inches in length; tail\r\nlong and deeply forked; bill yellow with a band of black about the\r\nmiddle. Whole head pure white, shading into the pearly color of the\r\nupper and under parts. A narrow band of black through the eye and over\r\nthe ear coverts. A very rare species that is supposed to breed in\r\nsouthern South America. Given a place among North American birds on the\r\nstrength of a specimen seen by Audubon off Long Island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 054: Elegant Tern. Cabot's Tern.]\r\n[Illustration: Cream color.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 53\r\n\r\n69. FORSTER'S TERN. _Sterna forsteri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, breeding from Manitoba, Mass., and\r\nCalifornia, south to the Gulf Coast and Texas.\r\n\r\nLength about fifteen inches; tail long and deeply forked; crown black,\r\nback and wings pearl and under parts white. Bill orange red. This\r\nspecies and the three following are the most graceful of birds in\r\nappearance and flight. Their movements can only be likened to those of\r\nthe Swallows, from which they get the name of \"Sea Swallows.\" Their food\r\nconsists of fish, which they get by diving, and marine insects. They\r\nbreed by thousands in the marshes from Manitoba to Texas and along the\r\nSouth Atlantic coast. The eggs are laid in a hollow on the dry grassy\r\nportions of the islands or marshes. They generally lay three eggs and\r\nrarely four. They are buffy or brownish spotted with dark brown and\r\nlilac. Size 1.80 × 1.30. Data.--Cobb's Island, Va., June 8, 1887. Eggs\r\nin a hollow on grassy bank. Collector, F. H. Judson.\r\n\r\n\r\n70. COMMON TERN. _Sterna hirundo._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding both on the coast and in the\r\ninterior from the Gulf States northward.\r\n\r\nThis bird differs from the preceding chiefly in having a bright red bill\r\ntipped with black, and the under parts washed with pearl. These are the\r\nmost common Terns on the New England coast, nesting abundantly from\r\nVirginia to Newfoundland. These beautiful Terns, together with others of\r\nthe family, were formerly killed by thousands for millinery purposes,\r\nbut the practice is now being rapidly stopped. In May and June they lay\r\ntheir three, or sometimes four eggs on the ground as do the other Terns.\r\nThey are similar to the preceding species but average shorter.\r\nData.--Duck Is., Maine, June 30, 1896. Three eggs in marsh grass about\r\nfifty feet from beach. No nest. Collector, C. A. Reed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 055: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Forsters Tern. Common Tern.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 54\r\n\r\n71. ARCTIC TERN. _Sterna paradisaea._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding from New England northward to the\r\nArctic Regions and wintering south to California and the South Atlantic\r\nStates. A similar bird to the last, differing in having the bill wholly\r\nred and the feet being smaller and weak for the size of the bird. A more\r\nnorthern bird than the last, breeding abundantly in Alaska, both on the\r\ncoast and in the interior. In the southern limits of its breeding range,\r\nit nests in company with the Common Tern, its nests and eggs being\r\nindistinguishable from the latter. When their nesting grounds are\r\napproached, all the birds arise like a great white cloud, uttering their\r\nharsh, discordant \"tearrr, tearrr,\" while now and then an individual,\r\nbolder than the rest, will swoop close by with an angry \"crack.\" On the\r\nwhole they are timid birds, keeping well out of reach. The nesting\r\nseason is early in June. Eggs like the preceding. Data.--Little Duck\r\nIs., Me., June 29, 1896. Three eggs in a slight hollow on the beach,\r\nthree feet above high water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n72. ROSEATE TERN. _Sterna dougalli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America on the east coast, breeding from New\r\nEngland to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nThese are the most beautiful birds, having a delicate pink blush on the\r\nunder parts during the breeding season; the tail is very long and deeply\r\nforked, the outer feathers being over five inches longer than the middle\r\nones; the bill is red with a black tip. They nest in large colonies on\r\nthe islands from Southern New England southward, placing the nests in\r\nthe short grass, generally without any lining. They lay two or three\r\neggs which are indistinguishable from the two preceding species.\r\n\r\n\r\n73. ALEUTIAN TERN. _Sterna aleutica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Found in summer in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.\r\n\r\nSouth in winter to Japan. This handsome Tern is of the form and size of\r\nthe Common Tern, but has a darker mantle, and the forehead is white,\r\nleaving a black line from the bill to the eye. They nest on islands off\r\nthe coast of Alaska, sometimes together with the Arctic Tern. The eggs\r\nare laid upon the bare ground or moss, and are similar to the Arctic\r\nTerns, but average narrower. They are two or three in number and are\r\nlaid in June and July. Size 1.70 × 1.15. Data.--Stuart Is., Alaska.\r\nThree eggs in a slight hollow in the moss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 056: Arctic Tern. Roseate Tern. Aleutian Tern.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish or Brownish.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 55\r\n\r\n74. LEAST TERN. _Sterna antillarum._\r\n\r\nRange.--From northern South America to southern New England, Dakota and\r\nCalifornia, breeding locally throughout its range.\r\n\r\nThese little Sea Swallows are the smallest of the Terns, being but 9\r\ninches in length. They have a yellow bill with a black tip, a black\r\ncrown and nape, and white forehead. Although small, these little Terns\r\nlose none of the grace and beauty of action of their larger relatives.\r\nThey nest in colonies on the South Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, placing\r\ntheir eggs upon the bare sand, where they are sometimes very difficult\r\nto see among the shells and pebbles. They are of a grayish or buffy\r\ncolor spotted with umber and lilac. They number two, three and rarely\r\nfour, and are laid in May and June. Size 1.25 × .95. Data.--DeSota\r\nBeach, Fla., May 20, 1884. Three eggs laid on the sandy beach.\r\nCollector, Chas. Graham.\r\n\r\n\r\n75. SOOTY TERN. _Sterna fuscata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical America, north to the South Atlantic States. This\r\nspecies measures 17 inches in length; it has a brownish black mantle,\r\nwings and tail, except the outer feathers of the latter which are white;\r\nthe forehead and under parts are white, the crown and a line from the\r\neye to the bill, black. This tropical species is very numerous at its\r\nbreeding grounds on the small islands of the Florida Keys and the West\r\nIndies. They lay but a single egg, generally placing it on the bare\r\nground, or occasionally building a frail nest of grasses. The egg has a\r\npinkish white or creamy ground and is beautifully sprinkled with spots\r\nof reddish brown and lilac. They are laid during May. Size 2.05 × 1.45.\r\nData.--Clutheria Key, Bahamas, May 28, 1891. Single egg laid on bare\r\nground near water. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 057: Light buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Least Tern. Sooty Tern.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 56\r\n\r\n76. BRIDLED TERN. _Sterna anaetheta._\r\n\r\nRange.--Found in tropical regions of both hemispheres; casual or\r\naccidental in Florida. This Tern is similar to the last except that the\r\nnape is white and the white of the forehead extends in a line over the\r\neye. The Bridled Tern is common on some of the islands of the West\r\nIndies and the Bahamas, nesting in company with the Sooty Terns and\r\nNoddies. The single egg is laid on the seashore or among the rocks. It\r\nis creamy white beautifully marked with brown and lilac. Size 1.85 ×\r\n1.25. Data.--Bahamas, May 9, 1892. Single egg laid in a cavity among the\r\nrocks. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.\r\n\r\n77. BLACK TERN. _Hydrochelidon nigra surinamensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate America, breeding from the middle portions of the\r\nUnited States northward to Alaska; south in winter beyond the United\r\nStates Border.\r\n\r\nThe identity of these Terns cannot be mistaken. They are but ten inches\r\nin length; the whole head, neck and under parts are black; the back,\r\nwings and tail are slaty and the under tail coverts are white. Their\r\ndainty figure with their long slender wings gives them a grace and\r\nairiness, if possible, superior to other species of the family. They are\r\nvery active and besides feeding upon all manner of marine crustacea,\r\nthey capture many insects in the air. They nest in large colonies in\r\nmarshes, both along the coast and in the interior, making a nest of\r\ndecayed reeds and grasses, or often laying their eggs upon rafts of\r\ndecayed vegetation which are floating on the water. The nesting season\r\ncommences in May, they laying three eggs of a brownish or greenish\r\ncolor, very heavily blotched with blackish brown. Size 1.35 × .95.\r\nData.--Winnebago City, Minn., May 31, 1901. Three eggs. Nest made of a\r\nmass of weeds and rushes floating on water in a swamp. Collector, R. H.\r\nBullis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 058: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Black Tern. Noddy. Black Skimmer.]\r\n[Illustration: Deep greenish brown.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 57\r\n\r\n78. WHITE-WINGED BLACK TERN. _Hydrochelidon leucoptera._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern Hemisphere, its addition to American birds being made\r\nbecause of the accidental appearance of one bird in Wisconsin in 1873.\r\nThey nest very abundantly among the lakes and marshes of southern\r\nEurope, placing their eggs the same as the American species, upon masses\r\nof decayed reeds and stalks. They lay three eggs which have a somewhat\r\nbrighter appearance than the common Black Terns because of a somewhat\r\nlighter ground color.\r\n\r\n\r\n79. NODDY. _Anous stolidus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical America, north to the Gulf and South Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nA peculiar but handsome bird (about fifteen inches long), with a silvery\r\nwhite head and the rest of the plumage brownish, and the tail rounded.\r\nThey breed in abundance on some of the Florida Keys, the West Indies and\r\nthe Bahamas. Their nests are made of sticks and grass, and are placed\r\neither in trees or on the ground. They lay but a single egg with a buffy\r\nor cream colored ground spotted with chestnut and lilac. Size 2.00 ×\r\n1.30. Atwood's Key, Bahamas, June 1, 1891. Nest made of sticks and\r\ngrasses, three feet up a mangrove. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 059: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Noddy.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 58\r\n\r\nSKIMMERS. Family RYNCHOPIDÆ\r\n\r\nSkimmers are Tern-like birds having a very strangely developed bill. The\r\nlower mandible is much longer than the upper and very thin, the upper\r\nedge being as sharp as the lower. The lower mandible is rounded at the\r\nend while the upper is more pointed. Young Skimmers are said to have\r\nboth mandibles of the same length, the abnormal development not\r\nappearing until after flight. Skimmers are very graceful birds, and, as\r\nimplied by their name, they skim over the surface of the water, rising\r\nand falling with the waves, and are said to pick up their food by\r\ndropping the lower mandible below the surface, its thin edge cutting the\r\nwater like a knife. There are four species of Skimmers, only one of\r\nwhich is found in North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n80. BLACK SKIMMER. _Rynchops nigra._\r\n\r\nRange.--The South Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, breeding from New Jersey\r\nsouthward. The Black Skimmer is about eighteen inches in length, and\r\nbesides the remarkable bill is a bird of striking plumage; the forehead,\r\nends of the secondaries, tail feathers and under parts are white; the\r\nrest of the plumage is black and the basal half of the bill is crimson.\r\nSkimmers nest in large communities, the same as do the Terns, laying\r\ntheir eggs in hollows in the sand. They are partially nocturnal in their\r\nhabits and their hoarse barking cries may be heard after the shadows of\r\nnight have enveloped the earth. Fishermen call them by the names of\r\n\"Cut-water\" and \"Sea Dog.\" The nesting season commences in May and\r\ncontinues through June and July. They lay from three to five eggs,\r\nhaving a creamy or yellowish buff ground, blotched with black, chestnut\r\nand lilac. Size 1.75 × 1.30. Data.--Cobb's Is., Va., June 8, 1894. Three\r\neggs laid in a hollow on the beach. No nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 060: Buffy yellow.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 59\r\n\r\nTUBE-NOSED SWIMMERS. Order III. TUBINARES.\r\n\r\nALBATROSSES. Family DIOMEDEIDAE\r\n\r\nAlbatrosses are the largest of the sea birds and have an enormous\r\nexpanse of wing, the Wandering Albatross, the largest of the family,\r\nsometimes attaining an expanse of fourteen feet. Their nostrils consist\r\nof two slightly projecting tubes, one on each side near the base of the\r\nbill. They are unsurpassed in powers of flight, but are only fair\r\nswimmers and rarely, if ever, dive, getting their food, which consists\r\nof dead animal matter, from the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n81. BLACK-FOOTED ALBATROSS. _Diomedea nigripes._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific from California northward. This Albatross is\r\nthirty-two inches in length; it is of a uniform sooty brown color\r\nshading into whitish at the base of the bill, which is rounded. Like the\r\nother members of the family, this species is noted for its extended\r\nflights, following vessels day after day without any apparent period of\r\nrest, for the purpose of feeding on the refuse that is thrown overboard.\r\nThey breed during our winter on some of the small isolated islands in\r\nthe extreme southern portions of the globe. They lay a single white egg\r\non the bare ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n82. SHORT-TAILED ALBATROSS. _Diomedea albatrus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific Ocean in summer, from Lower California to Alaska.\r\nWith the exception of the Wandering Albatross, which is now regarded as\r\ndoubtful as occurring off our coasts, the Short-tailed Albatross is one\r\nof the largest of the group, measuring thirty-six inches in length, and\r\nhas an extent of seven feet or more. With the exception of the black\r\nprimaries, shoulders and tail, the entire plumage is white, tinged with\r\nstraw color on the back of the head. They breed on the guano islands in\r\nthe North Pacific off the coasts of Alaska and Japan. They lay a single\r\nwhite egg on the bare ground or rocks. As with the other members of the\r\nfamily, the eggs are extremely variable in size, but average about 4.25\r\n× 2.50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 061: Black-footed Albatross.\r\nShort-tailed Albatross.]\r\n\r\nPage 60\r\n\r\n82.1. LAYSAN ALBATROSS. _Diomedea immutabilis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Laysan Island of the Hawaiian Group, appearing casually off the\r\ncoast of California. This species breeds in large numbers on the island\r\nfrom which it takes its name. The birds are white with the exception of\r\nthe back, wings and tail, which are black. The birds, having been little\r\nmolested in their remote island, are exceedingly tame, and it is\r\npossible to go among the sitting birds without disturbing them. Mr.\r\nWalter K. Fisher has contributed an admirable report on this species in\r\nthe 1913 Bulletin of the Fish Commission, the report being illustrated\r\nwith numerous illustrations of the birds from photos by the author.\r\nTheir single white eggs are laid on the bare ground.\r\n\r\n83. YELLOW-NOSED ALBATROSS. _Thalassogeron culminatus._\r\n\r\nThis is a species which inhabits the South Pacific and Indian Oceans,\r\nand is said to rarely occur on the California coast. They breed during\r\nour winter on some of the small islands and during our summer are ocean\r\nwanderers. An egg in the collection of Col. John E. Thayer was taken on\r\nGough Island, South Atlantic Ocean; Sept. 1st, 1888. The nest was a\r\nmound of mud and grass about two feet in height. The single white egg\r\nmeasured 3.75 × 2.25. It was collected by George Comer.\r\n\r\n\r\n84. SOOTY ALBATROSS. _Phoebetria-palpebrata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern seas, north in our summer along the Pacific coast of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is entirely sooty brown except the white eyelids. It is\r\nsimilar to the Black-footed Albatross from which species it can be\r\ndistinguished in all plumages by the narrow base of the bill, while the\r\nbill of the former species is broad and rounded. They breed commonly on\r\nisolated islands in many quarters of the southern hemisphere. Sometimes\r\nthis species constructs a mound of mud on which to deposit its single\r\nwhite egg, and also often lays it on the bare ground or rock. A specimen\r\nin Mr. Thayer's collection, taken by Geo. Comer on So. Georgia Is. in\r\nthe South Atlantic ocean, was laid in a hollow among loose stones on the\r\nledge of an overhanging cliff. Size 4.10 × 2.75.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 062: Laysan Albatross. Yellow-nosed Albatross. Sooty\r\nAlbatross.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 61\r\n\r\nFULMARS, SHEARWATERS and PETRELS Family PROCELLARIDAE\r\n\r\nFulmars, Shearwaters and Petrels are Gull-like birds with two nostril\r\ntubes located side by side, in a single tube, on the top of the bill at\r\nits base.\r\n\r\nThe Fulmars are mostly northern birds while the majority of the\r\nShearwaters nest in the extreme south during our winter, and appear off\r\nour coasts during the summer. Their food consists of fish or offal which\r\nthey get from the surface of the water; large flocks of them hover about\r\nfishermen, watching their chance to get any food which falls, or is\r\nthrown, overboard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 063: EGG OF SOOTY ALBATROSS--White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand border.]\r\n\r\nPage 62\r\n\r\n85. GIANT FULMAR. _Macronectes gigantea._\r\n\r\nRange.--This Petrel is a native of the southern seas and is only\r\ncasually met with off the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nIt is the largest of the family, being about three feet in length, and\r\nis normally a uniform sooty color, although it has light phases of\r\nplumage. They nest in December on many of the islands south of Africa\r\nand South America, laying their single white egg on the bare rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n86. FULMAR. _Fulmarus glacialis glacialis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic coasts from New England northward, breeding from\r\nHudson Bay and southern Greenland northward.\r\n\r\nThis bird which is 19 inches in length, in the light phase has a plumage\r\nvery similar to that of the larger Gulls. They nest by thousands on\r\nrocky islands of the north, often in company with Murres and Gulls.\r\nOwing to the filthy habits of the Fulmars, these breeding grounds always\r\nhave a nauseating odor, which is also imparted to, and retained by the\r\negg shell. Their single white eggs are laid on the bare rocks, in\r\ncrevices of the cliffs, often hundreds of feet above the water. Size\r\n2.90 × 2.00. Data.--St. Kilda, off Scotland. June 5, 1897. Single egg\r\nlaid on rock on side of sea cliff. Collector, Angus Gillies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 062: Fulmar.]\r\n[Illustration: egg.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 63\r\n\r\n86b. PACIFIC FULMAR. _Fulmarus glacialis glupischa._\r\n\r\nThis sub-species of the preceding, has a darker mantle than the common\r\nFulmar; it is found on the northern Pacific coasts where it breeds on\r\nthe high rocky cliffs, the same as its eastern relative. They nest in\r\nlarge colonies, every crevice in the rocks having its tenant. Their\r\nflight is graceful like that of the Gulls, which they closely resemble.\r\nThey lay but a single white egg, the average dimensions of which are\r\nslightly smaller than those of the common Fulmar. Data.--Copper Is.,\r\nAlaska. May 14, 1889. Egg laid in a crevice among the cliffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n86.1. RODGER'S FULMAR. _Fulmarus rodgers._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific, breeding in large numbers on some of the islands\r\nin Bering Sea; south to California in winter. Very similar to the two\r\npreceding species except that the back is mixed with whitish, it is not\r\nbelieved to have a dark phase. Their breeding habits and eggs do not\r\ndiffer from the common Fulmar. The eggs are laid on the rocky cliffs\r\nduring June.\r\n\r\n\r\n87. SLENDER-BILLED FULMAR. _Priocella glacialoides._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern seas, appearing on the Pacific coast of the United\r\nStates in the summer. This species has a paler mantle than the others of\r\nthe family, and the primaries are black. The make-up and plumage of the\r\nwhole bird is more like that of the Gulls than any of the others. They\r\nprobably breed in the far south during our winter, although we have no\r\ndefinite data relative to their nesting habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 065: Pacific Fulmar. Slender-billed Fulmar.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 64\r\n\r\n88. CORY'S SHEARWATER. _Puffinus borealis._\r\n\r\nThis species probably breeds in the far south. It has been found only\r\noff the coast of Massachusetts and Long Island. This is the largest of\r\nour Shearwaters, and can be distinguished from the next species by its\r\nwholly white underparts, its light mantle and yellowish bill. We have no\r\ndata relative to its nesting habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n89. GREATER SHEARWATER. _Puffinus gravis._\r\n\r\nRange.--The whole of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThousands of them spend the latter part of the summer off the New\r\nEngland coast, where they are known to the fishermen as Haglets. Their\r\nupper parts are brownish gray, darker on the wings; bill and feet dark;\r\nunderparts white, with the middle of the belly and the under tail covers\r\ndusky. Length about 20 inches. Little is known concerning their nesting\r\nquarters, although they are said to breed in Greenland. From the fact of\r\ntheir early appearance off the New England coast it is probable that the\r\ngreater part of them nest in the far south.\r\n\r\n\r\n90. MANX SHEARWATER. _Puffinus puffinus._\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits the North Atlantic ocean chiefly on the European\r\nside, being abundant in the Mediterranean and in the British Isles.\r\nThese birds deposit their single pure white eggs in crevices among the\r\ncliffs, on the ground or in burrows dug by themselves. Size of egg 2.35\r\n× 1.60. Data.--Isle of Hay, North Scotland. June 1, 1893. Single egg\r\nlaid at the end of a three foot burrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 066: Cory Shearwater. Greater Shearwater.]\r\n[Illustration: Egg of Audubon's Shearwater--White.]\r\n[Illustration: Audubon's Shearwater.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 65\r\n\r\n91. PINK-FOOTED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus creatopus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Ocean, north on American side to California in summer.\r\n\r\nThis species, whose breeding habits are little known, is similar in size\r\nand color to the Greater Shearwater, differing chiefly in the yellowish\r\nbill and pinkish colored feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n92. AUDUBON'S SHEARWATER. _Puffinus lherminieri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Middle Atlantic, ranging north in late summer to Long Island.\r\n\r\nThis bird, having a length of but twelve inches, is the smallest of the\r\nShearwaters found along our coasts. Large colonies of them breed on some\r\nof the small islands and keys of the West Indies and Bahamas, and not so\r\ncommonly in the Bermudas. Their eggs, which are pure white, are\r\ndeposited at the end of burrows dug by the birds. Size of egg 2.00 ×\r\n1.35. Their nesting season commences about the latter part of March and\r\ncontinues through April and May. After the young are able to fly, like\r\nother members of the family, the birds become ocean wanderers and stray\r\nnorth to southern New England. Data.--Bahamas, April 13, 1891. Single\r\negg laid at the end of a burrow about two feet in length. Collector, D.\r\nP. Ingraham.\r\n\r\n\r\n92.1. ALLIED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus assimilis._\r\n\r\nThis is an Australian and New Zealand species that has accidentally\r\nstrayed to the shores of Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n\r\n93. BLACK-VENTED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus opisthomelas._\r\n\r\nRange.--Middle Pacific coast of the Americas, north in late summer along\r\nthe coast of California. This species breeds commonly on the islands off\r\nthe coast of Lower California, especially on the Gulf side. Their single\r\negg is white, size 2.00 × 1.30, and is located at the end of a burrow.\r\nData.--Natividad Is., Lower California, April 10, 1897. Single egg laid\r\non the sand at the end of a burrow six feet in length. Collector, A. W.\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\n\r\n93.1. TOWNSEND'S SHEARWATER. _Puffinus auricularis._\r\n\r\nThis bird ranges from Cape St. Lucas, south along the Pacific coast of\r\nMexico, breeding on the Revillagigedo Islands off the Mexican coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 067: Pink-footed Shearwater. Black-vented Shearwater.\r\nTownsend's Shearwater.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 66\r\n\r\n94. SOOTY SHEARWATER. _Puffins fuliginosus._\r\n\r\nRange.--A common species off the Atlantic coast in summer; breeds along\r\nour northern coasts, and it is also supposed that many of them nest in\r\nsouthern seas and reach our coasts early in the summer. These\r\nShearwaters are entirely sooty gray, being somewhat lighter below. They\r\nare called \"black haglets\" by the fishermen, whose vessels they follow\r\nin the hope of procuring bits of refuse. They commonly nest in burrows\r\nin the ground, but are also said to build in fissures among the ledges.\r\nTheir single white egg measures 2.55 × 1.75. Data.--Island in Ungava\r\nBay, northern Labrador, June 14, 1896. Egg laid in a fissure of a sea\r\ncliff. Collector, A. N. McFord.\r\n\r\n\r\n95. DARK-BODIED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus griseus._\r\n\r\nThis is a southern species which, after having nested on islands in the\r\nfar south during our winter, comes north and appears off the Pacific\r\ncoast of the United States during the summer. It is a similar bird to\r\nthe Sooty Shearwater, but is considerably darker and the under coverts\r\nare whitish. Their nesting habits are the same as those of other members\r\nof the family. Size of egg, 2.40 × 1.65. Data.--Stewart's Island, New\r\nZealand, February 15, 1896. Single egg at the end of a long burrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n96. SLENDER-BILLED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus tenuirostris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Pacific Ocean in the summer, extending from Japan and\r\nAlaska southward. Supposed to breed in the southern hemisphere, as well\r\nas probably on some of the Aleutians in Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\n96.1. WEDGE-TAILED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus cuneatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific, breeding on the Revillagigedo Islands off the\r\ncoast of Mexico, and probably on some of the small islands in the Gulf\r\nof California.\r\n\r\n\r\n97. BLACK-TAILED SHEARWATER. _Priofinus cinerus._\r\n\r\nThis is a Shearwater which inhabits the southern hemisphere, but which\r\nhas accidentally wandered to the Pacific coast of the United States. It\r\nis dark above and whitish below, with black under tail coverts. It\r\nbreeds in the far south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 068: Sooty Shearwater.]\r\n[Illustration: Dark-bodied Shearwater. Slender-billed Shearwater.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 67\r\n\r\n98. BLACK-CAPPED PETREL. _Æstrelata hasitata._\r\n\r\nThis is not a common species; it is an inhabitant of tropical seas and\r\nhas only been casually found on our coasts or inland. It is a handsome\r\nspecies with white forehead, underparts and nape with a small isolated\r\nblack cap on the crown; the rest of the upper parts are blackish. It is\r\na native of the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\n99. SCALED PETREL. _Æstrelata scalaris._\r\n\r\nThis is another rare species which is an inhabitant of southern seas. A\r\nsingle specimen taken in New York State gives it a claim as a doubtful\r\nNorth American species. It is a handsome bird, the feathers of the\r\ngrayish upperparts being edged with white, thus giving it the appearance\r\nof being barred. Its eggs have only been known to science within the\r\npast few years. Data.--Preservation Inlet, New Zealand, June 7, 1900.\r\nSingle white egg. Size 2.40 × 1.75. Collector, P. Seymour. Parent bird\r\ntaken with the egg.\r\n\r\n\r\n100. FISHER'S PETREL. _Æstralata fisheri._\r\n\r\nThis is a handsome bird known only from the type specimen taken off\r\nKadiak Is., Alaska, by Mr. Fisher.\r\n\r\n\r\n101. BULWER'S PETREL. _Bulweria bulweri._\r\n\r\nAn eastern Atlantic species which is only an accidental visitant to our\r\nshores. They breed on the Madeira Islands where the eggs are laid in\r\ncrevices among the rocks or in burrows in the ground. Size 1.75 × 1.55,\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n\r\n102. PINTADO PETREL. _Daption capensis._\r\n\r\nThis is the Cape Pigeon of the southern hemisphere. It has only\r\naccidentally occurred on our coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 069: Black-capped Petrel. Scaled Petrel. Fisher's\r\nPetrel.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 68\r\n\r\n103. LEAST PETREL. _Halocyptena microsoma._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of America from Lower California to Panama. The\r\nLeast Petrel is the smallest of this family, in length measuring only\r\n5.75 inches. Their plumage is entirely dark sooty. They have been found\r\nbreeding on San Benito Island, Lower California, and they probably do on\r\nothers farther south. The single egg that this bird lays is white with a\r\nwreath of fine black specks around one and sometimes both ends.\r\nData.--San Benito Is., Lower California, June 12, 1897. No nest, the egg\r\nbeing simply laid on the bare rock in a crevice. Size 1.00 × .75.\r\nCollector, A. W. Anthony.\r\n\r\n\r\n104. STORM PETREL. _Thalassidroma pelagica._\r\n\r\nNorth Atlantic Ocean chiefly on the European side, wintering south to\r\nNew Brunswick. Smallest of the white rumped, black petrels; 5.75 inches\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nThis species is the originally called \"Mother Cary's Chicken\" by the\r\nsailors. They nest abundantly on many of the islands off the coasts of\r\nEurope and the British Isles, laying their single egg either in burrows\r\nor crevices among the cliffs. Data.--Coast of County Kerry, Ireland,\r\nJune 1, 1895. Single egg laid at the end of burrow in a sea cliff. Size\r\n1.05 × .80; white with a wreath of very fine dots about the larger end.\r\nCollector, G. H. McDonald.\r\n\r\n\r\n105. FORKED-TAILED PETREL. _Oceanodroma furcata._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific from California to Alaska, breeding in the\r\nAleutians.\r\n\r\nThese birds have a plumage of bluish gray, the wings being darker and\r\nthe underparts lightest. The nests are made in burrows or crevices in\r\nthe banks. Data.--Uniak Is., Alaska, June 10, 1900. No nest. Single egg\r\nlaid at the end of a burrow. Several pairs nesting near. Egg white with\r\na fine wreath of purplish black specks about the large end. Size 1.25 ×\r\n.95.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 070: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Least Petrel. Stormy Petrel. Forked-tailed Petrel.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 69\r\n\r\n105.2. KÆDING'S PETREL. _Oceanodroma kædingi._\r\n\r\nThis bird is similar to Leach Petrel, but is smaller and the tail is\r\nless deeply forked. Its range is from California to Panama breeding on\r\nthe Revillagigedo Islands off Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n106. LEACH'S PETREL. _Oceanodroma leucorhoa._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, breeding from Maine and\r\nfrom the Farallones, northward to Greenland and the Aleutians.\r\n\r\nThese are the most common of the Petrels found on our coast; they are\r\neight inches in length, of a sooty brown color, and have a white rump.\r\nThe forked tail will at once distinguish them from any of the Atlantic\r\nPetrels. They nest in burrows in the ground, laying a pure white egg,\r\nsometimes with a very faint dusty wreath about the larger end. Size 1.20\r\n× .95. These birds generally take turns in the task of incubation, one\r\nremaining at sea during the day and returning at night while his mate\r\ntakes her turn roving the briny deep in search of food. The young are\r\nfed by regurgitation upon an oily fluid which has a very offensive odor.\r\nThis odor is always noticeable about an island inhabited by Petrels and\r\nis always retained by the eggs or skins of these birds. They are very\r\nrarely seen flying in the vicinity of their nesting island during the\r\nday; the bird that is on the nest will remain until removed by hand.\r\nData.--Pumpkin Is., Maine, June 22, 1893. Single egg; nest of a few\r\ngrasses at the end of a burrow dug in the bank. Collector, J. Lefavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n106.1 GUADALUPE PETREL. _Oceanodroma macrodactyla._\r\n\r\nThis species, which is very similar to the preceding, except for a\r\nlonger and more deeply forked tail, breeds on Guadalupe Is. Their eggs\r\nare white very minutely wreathed with reddish brown; they are, however,\r\nnearly always nest stained to an uneven brownish color. Data.--Guadalupe\r\nIs., Lower California, March 24, 1897. Single egg laid on a few oak\r\nleaves and pine needles at the end of a three foot burrow. Size of egg\r\n1.40 × 1.00. Collector, A. W. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 071: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Kæding's Petrel. Leach's Petrel. Guadalupe Petrel.]\r\n[Illustration: White, nest stained.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand border.]\r\n\r\nPage 70\r\n\r\n107. BLACK PETREL. _Oceanodroma melania._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Pacific, from southern California southward, breeding on\r\nthe small islands on both coasts of Lower California. They are similar\r\nto the Leach's Petrel except that the rump is blackish. Data.--San\r\nBenito Is., Lower California, July 23, 1896. White egg laid on bare\r\nground at the end of three foot burrow. Size 1.40 × 1. Collector, A. W.\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\n108. ASHY PETREL. _Oceanodroma homochroa._\r\n\r\nRange.--California coast, breeding on the Farallones and Santa Barbara\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThis species, while not common, nests in all manner of localities on the\r\nFarallones, concealing their eggs under any rock or in any crevice that\r\nmay attract their fancy. Their single white egg is only faintly if at\r\nall wreathed with fine dust-like specks of reddish brown. Size 1.15 ×\r\n.86. Data.--Farallone Is., California, June 12, 1895. Egg laid on sand\r\nin crevice at the base of a stone wall; well concealed. Collector,\r\nChester Barlow.\r\n\r\n\r\n108.1. SOCORRO PETREL. _Oceanodroma socorroensis._\r\n\r\nBreeds on Socorro, San Benito and Coronado Islands, placing its eggs at\r\nthe end of burrow. Data.--San Benito Is., Lower California, July 12,\r\n1897. Single egg at the end of a burrow 3 feet in length. Egg pure white\r\nvery finely wreathed with pale reddish brown. Size 1.15 × .87.\r\nCollector, A. W. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 072: Black Petrel. Ashy Petrel.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 71\r\n\r\n109. WILSON'S PETREL. _Oceanites oceanicus._\r\n\r\nBreeds in the southern hemisphere in February and March and spends the\r\nsummer off the Atlantic coast as far north as Newfoundland. This species\r\ncan be distinguished from Leach Petrel by its square tail and from the\r\nStormy Petrel by its large size and yellow webs to its feet. These birds\r\nare the greatest wanderers of the genus, being found at different\r\nseasons in nearly all quarters of the globe. Their single egg is white.\r\nSize 1.25 × .90.\r\n\r\n\r\n110. WHITE-BELLIED PETREL. _Fregetta grallaria._\r\n\r\nA small species (length about 7.5 inches) inhabiting southern seas.\r\nRecorded once at Florida. General plumage blackish. Upper tail coverts,\r\nbases of tail feathers, under wing coverts, and abdomen, white.\r\n\r\n\r\n111. WHITE-FACED PETREL. _Pelagodroma marina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern seas, accidentally north to the coast of Massachusetts.\r\nThis beautiful species is of about the same size as the Leach's Petrel.\r\nIt has bluish gray upper parts; the whole under parts, as well as the\r\nforehead and sides of head, are white.\r\n\r\nThese birds have the same characteristics as do others of the species,\r\npattering over the water with their feet as they skim over the crests\r\nand troughs of the waves. They are not uncommon in the waters about New\r\nZealand where they breed. Their single eggs are about the same as\r\nLeach's Petrel, are brilliant white and are, very strongly, for a Petrel\r\negg, wreathed about the large end with dots of reddish brown. Size 1.32\r\n× .90. Data.--Chatham Is., New Zealand, January 7, 1901. Egg laid at end\r\nof a burrow. Collector, J. Lobb. This egg is in Mr. Thayer's collection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 073: Wilson's Petrel. White-billed Petrel.

Family PHAETHONTIDAE\r\n\r\nTropic Birds are Tern-like birds, having all the toes connected by a\r\nweb, and having the two central tail feathers very much lengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n112. YELLOW-BILLED TROPIC BIRD. _Phæthon americanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical regions, breeding in the Bahamas, West Indies and the\r\nBermudas, casual in Florida and along the South Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThe Tropic Birds are the most strikingly beautiful of all the sea birds;\r\nthey are about 30 inches in length, of which their long slender tail\r\ntakes about 20 inches. They fly with the ease and grace of a Tern, but\r\nwith quicker wing beats. They feed on small fish, which they capture by\r\ndarting down upon, and upon snails which they get from the beach and\r\nledges. They build their nests in the crevices and along the ledges of\r\nthe rocky cliffs. While gregarious to a certain extent they are not\r\nnearly as much so as the Terns. The nest is made of a mass of seaweed\r\nand weeds; but one egg is laid, this being of a creamy or pale purplish\r\nground color, dotted and sprinkled with chestnut, so thickly as to often\r\nobscure the ground color. Size 2.10 × 1.45. Data.--Coney Is., Bermudas,\r\nMay 1, 1901. Nest made of moss and seaweed in a crevice on ledge of\r\ncliff. Collector, A. H. Verrill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 074: Dull purplish.]\r\n[Illustration: Yellow-billed Tropic Bird. Red-billed Tropic Bird.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 73\r\n\r\n113. RED-BILLED TROPIC BIRD. _Phæthon æthereus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical seas, chiefly in the Pacific Ocean; north to southern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThey breed on several islands in the Gulf of California. This species\r\ndiffers from the preceding in having a red bill, and the back being\r\nbarred with black. Their plumage has a peculiar satiny appearance and is\r\nquite dazzling when viewed in the sunlight. They are strong fliers and\r\nare met with, hundreds of miles from land. They often rest upon the\r\nwater, elevating their long tails to keep them from getting wet. They\r\nnest, as do the preceding species, on rocky islands and are said to also\r\nbuild their nests in trees or upon the ground. The single egg that they\r\nlay has a creamy ground and is minutely dotted with chestnut. Size 2.40\r\n× 1.55. Data.--Daphone Is., Galapagos Is., South Pacific, March 6, 1901.\r\nEgg laid in hole of a sea cliff. The eggs are easily told from those of\r\nthe yellow-billed by their much larger size. Collector, R. H. Beck.\r\n\r\n\r\n113.1 RED-TAILED TROPIC BIRD. _Phæthon rubricaudus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, accidental\r\noff the coast of Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis is a singularly beautiful species resembling the latter except that\r\nthe central tail feathers are bright red, with the extreme tips white.\r\nDuring August and September they breed in large colonies on small\r\nislands in the South Seas. On Mauritius Island they build their nests\r\neither in the trees or place them on the ground; the nest is made of\r\nseaweed, sticks and weeds; numbers of them nest on Laysan Is., of the\r\nHawaiian group, concealing their nests on the ground under overhanging\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\nThe single egg has a pale purplish ground speckled with brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 075: Pale purplish.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale purplish ground color.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 74\r\n\r\nGANNETS. Family SULIDAE\r\n\r\nGannets are large stoutly built birds, having the four toes joined by a\r\nweb; they have a small naked pouch beneath the bill; the bill is a\r\nlittle longer than the head, and the tail is quite short. The plumage of\r\nthe adults is generally white, that of the young grayish.\r\n\r\n\r\n114. BLUE-FACED BOOBY. _Sula syanops._\r\n\r\nRange.--Widely distributed in the tropical seas, north casually to\r\nFlorida and breeding in the Bahamas.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the Gannets, this one is stupid and will often remain\r\non the nest until removed with the hand, merely hissing at the intruder.\r\nOften they lay their eggs on the bare ground, but sometimes the nest is\r\nlined with seaweed or grass. They lay either one or two eggs early in\r\nApril. These eggs are of a dull white color and are heavily covered with\r\na chalky deposit. Size 2.50 × 1.70. Data.--Clarion Is., Mexico, May 24,\r\n1897. Nest a mere hollow in the sand near the beach. Collector, A. W.\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\n\r\n114.1. BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY. _Sula nebouxi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coasts and islands from the Gulf of California southward\r\nto Chili.\r\n\r\nThese birds nest in numbers on the island of San Pedro Martir in the\r\nGulf of California. They lay but a single egg, placing it upon the bare\r\nrock. Their breeding season extends from the latter part of March into\r\nMay. The egg is a dull white, generally nest stained and is covered with\r\nthe usual chalky deposit. Size 2.35 × 1.60. Data.--Clarion Island,\r\nMexico, May 21, 1897. Two eggs in a hollow in the sand near the beach.\r\nCollector, A. W. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 076: Blue-faced Booby.

BOOBY. _Sula leucogastra._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical coasts and islands of the Atlantic; north casually to\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nThe common Booby is an abundant bird on some of the islands of the\r\nBahamas and Bermudas; it is commonly called the Brown Booby because the\r\nupper parts are of a brownish gray. These birds, as do the other\r\nGannets, have great powers of flight and without apparent effort dart\r\nabout with the speed of an arrow. They are quite awkward upon their feet\r\nand are not very proficient swimmers. They rarely rest upon the water\r\nexcept when tired. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of them breed in\r\ncompany, laying their eggs upon the bare rocks. Sometimes a few sticks\r\nor grasses will be placed about the bird to prevent the eggs from\r\nrolling away. They generally lay two eggs, chalky white and nest\r\nstained. Size 2.40 × 1.60. Data.--Key West, Bahamas, April 14, 1891. No\r\nnest; two eggs laid on the bare rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n115.1. BREWSTER'S BOOBY. _Sula brewsteri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Lower California southward. This Gannet\r\nreplaces the common Booby on the Pacific coast. It nests abundantly on\r\nmany islands in the Gulf of California, and in company with the\r\nblue-footed variety, on San Pedro Martir Island. They generally lay two\r\neggs, placing them upon the bare rocks and surrounding them with a ring\r\nof sticks and seaweed to keep them in place. The eggs are chalky white\r\nand cannot be distinguished from those of the other Boobies. Data.--San\r\nBenedicto Is., Lower California, May 18, 1897. Single egg laid on the\r\nsand amid a few blades of grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n116. RED-FOOTED BOOBY. _Sula piscator._\r\n\r\nThis is another species that is only occasionally taken on the Florida\r\ncoast. The habits of the birds and their nesting habits are the same as\r\nthose of the others of the family. Two chalky white eggs are laid.\r\nData.--San Benedicto Is., Lower California, May 18, 1897. Single egg.\r\nNest a few twigs of rank grass. Collector, A. W. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 077: Chalky bluish white, nest stained.]\r\n[Illustration: Booby. Red-footed Booby.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 76\r\n\r\n117. GANNET. _Sula bassana._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic, breeding, in America, only on Bird Rocks in the\r\nSt. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThese are the largest of the family, being 35 inches in length. They\r\nfeed on fish which they catch by diving upon, from the air. When flying\r\ntheir neck is carried fully extended. They rest on the water when tired,\r\nthe numerous air cells beneath the skin, causing them to sit high up in\r\nthe water and enabling them to weather the severest storm in perfect\r\nsafety. The only known breeding place in America is Bird Rocks, where\r\nthey nest by thousands, placing their nests in rows on the narrow\r\nledges; the nests are made of piles of seaweed, mud and stones. They lay\r\nbut one egg of dingy white color and covered with a chalky deposit. On\r\nSt. Kilda Island, off the coast of Scotland, they breed by millions.\r\nThey are very tame and will frequently allow themselves to be touched\r\nwith the hand. It is said that thousands of the young are killed by\r\nfishermen every year and marketed in Edinburg and other places.\r\nData.--St. Kilda Island, Scotland, June 18, 1896. Single egg laid on a\r\nlarge mass of seaweed on a sea cliff. Collector, H. McDonald.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ganet Anhinga.]\r\n[Illustration: Chalky bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 77\r\n\r\nDARTERS. Family ANHINGIDAE\r\n\r\n118. WATER TURKEY. _Anhinga anhinga._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical America, north to the South Atlantic States and up the\r\nMississippi Valley to Illinois.\r\n\r\nAnhingas or Snake Birds are curiously formed creatures with a Heron-like\r\nhead and neck, and the body of a Cormorant. They live in colonies in\r\ninaccessible swamps. Owing to their thin and light bodies, they are\r\nremarkable swimmers, and pursue and catch fish under water with ease.\r\nWhen alarmed they have a habit of sinking their body below water,\r\nleaving only their head and neck visible, thereby having the appearance\r\nof a water snake. They also fly well and dive from their perch into the\r\nwater with the greatest celerity.\r\n\r\nThey nest in colonies in the swamps, placing their nests of sticks,\r\nleaves and moss in the bushes over the water. They breed in April,\r\nlaying from three to five bluish eggs, covered with a chalky deposit.\r\nSize 2.25 × 1.35. Data.--Gainesville, Florida, May 18, 1894. Nest in the\r\ntop of a button-wood tree, made of leaves and branches, overhanging the\r\nwater. Collector, George Graham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 079: Chalky bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: PELICAN POND. Washington Zoological Park.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 78\r\n\r\nCORMORANTS. Family PHALACROCORACIDÆ\r\n\r\nCormorants have a more bulky body than do the Anhingas; their tail is\r\nshorter and the bill strongly hooked at the tip. Cormorants are found in\r\nnearly all quarters of the globe. They are very gregarious and most\r\nspecies are maritime. They feed upon fish which they catch by pursuing\r\nunder water. Most of the Cormorants have green eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 080 left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 79\r\n\r\n119. CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax carbo._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Atlantic coast breeding from Maine to Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe common Cormorant or Shag is one of the largest of the race, having a\r\nlength of 36 inches.\r\n\r\nIn breeding plumage, the black head and neck are so thickly covered with\r\nthe slender white plumes as to almost wholly obscure the black. There is\r\nalso a large white patch on the flanks. They nest in colonies on the\r\nrocky shores of Newfoundland and Labrador, placing their nests of sticks\r\nand seaweed in rows along the high ledges, where they sit, as one writer\r\naptly expresses it, like so many black bottles. A few pairs also nest on\r\nsome of the isolated rocky islets off the Maine coast. During the latter\r\npart of May and during June they lay generally four or five greenish\r\nwhite, chalky looking eggs. Size 2.50 × 1.40. Data.--Black Horse Rock,\r\nMaine coast, June 6, 1893. Four eggs in a nest of seaweed and a few\r\nsticks; on a high ledge of rock. Collector, C. A. Reed.\r\n\r\n\r\n120. DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax auritus auritus._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Atlantic coast and also in the interior, breeding from Nova\r\nScotia and North Dakota northward.\r\n\r\nThis is a slightly smaller bird than carbo, and in the nesting season\r\nthe white plumes of the latter are replaced by tufts of black and white\r\nfeathers from above each eye. On the coast they nest the same as carbo\r\nand in company with them on rocky islands. In the interior they place\r\ntheir nests on the ground or occasionally in low trees on islands in the\r\nlakes. They breed in large colonies, making the nests of sticks and\r\nweeds and lay three or four eggs like those of the common Cormorant but\r\naveraging shorter. Size 2.30 × 1.40. Data.--Stump Lake, North Dakota,\r\nMay 31, 1897. Nest of dead weeds on an island. Six eggs. Collector, T.\r\nF. Eastgate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 081: Chalky greenish or bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Cormorant.

FLORIDA CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax auritus floridanus._\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is a common breeding bird in the swamps and islands of\r\nthe Gulf coast and north to South Carolina and southern Illinois. The\r\nnests are placed in the mangroves in some of the most impenetrable\r\nswamps and are composed of twigs and lined with leaves or moss. They lay\r\nthree or four chalky bluish white eggs. Size 2.30 × 1.40. Data.--Bird\r\nIs., Lake Kissimee, Florida, April 5, 1898. Three eggs. Nest made of\r\nweeds and grass, in a willow bush.\r\n\r\n\r\n120b. WHITE-CRESTED CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax auritus cincinatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern coast of North America, breeding in Alaska, and\r\nsouth to the northern boundary of the United States, breeding both in\r\nthe interior and on the coast, in the former case generally on the\r\nground or in low trees on swampy islands and in the latter, on the rocky\r\ncliffs of the coasts and islands. The nests are built in the same\r\nfashion as the other Cormorants, and the three to five eggs are similar.\r\nSize 2.45 × 1.40.\r\n\r\n\r\n120c. FARALLON CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax auritus albociliatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--This sub-species breeds on the coasts and islands of California\r\nand southward.\r\n\r\nIn company with other species of Cormorants, these birds breed in large\r\nnumbers on the Farallones, placing their nests well up on the higher\r\nridges and rocks. They breed most abundantly during May. When nesting on\r\nthe inland islands, they place their nests in low bushes. Their nests\r\nand eggs are similar to those of the other Cormorants. Size 2.40 × 1.50.\r\nData.--Farallones, California. Nest of weeds and seaweed on the rocks.\r\nCollector, W. O. Emerson.\r\n\r\n121. MEXICAN CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax vigua mexicanus._\r\n\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds abundantly from southern Texas, south through Mexico;\r\nnorth rarely to Kansas; has recently been found breeding in limited\r\nnumber on some of the Bahamas. In the interior they nest in trees,\r\nchiefly those overhanging or growing in the water. On the coasts they\r\nnest on the rocky ledges, as do the other Cormorants. They nest in\r\ncolonies building their abode of twigs and weeds, and during May laying\r\nthree or four eggs, greenish white in color and chalky, as are all the\r\nCormorants. Size 2.25 × 1.35.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n[Illustration 083: Greenish white.]\r\n\r\nPage 82\r\n\r\n122. BRANDT'S CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax penicillatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast breeding along the whole coast of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis species is found more abundantly on the Farallones than is the\r\nFarallone Cormorant. Like the other Cormorants breeding on these\r\nislands, these cling closely to their nests, for fear of being robbed by\r\nthe Gulls, that are ever on the watch to steal either eggs or young.\r\nTheir nesting habits and eggs are identical with those of the other\r\nspecies. Size 2.50 × 1.50. Data.--Bird Island, California, May 24, 1885.\r\nA very bulky nest of seaweed on the rocks. Collector, A. M. Ingersoll.\r\n\r\n\r\n123. PELAGIC CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax pelagicus pelagicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThese are perhaps the most beautiful species of Cormorants, having\r\nbrilliant violet green metallic reflections and, in the breeding\r\nplumage, crests on the forehead and nape, as well as large white flank\r\npatches. They breed in large colonies on the Aleutian Islands, placing\r\ntheir nests of sticks and sea mosses on the rocky ledges, often hundreds\r\nof feet above the sea level. Three or four eggs are laid during May and\r\nJune. The young birds when hatched are naked and black, and are\r\nrepulsive looking objects, as are those of all the other Cormorants. The\r\neggs are greenish white with the usual calcareous deposit. Size 2.30 ×\r\n1.40.\r\n\r\n\r\n123a. VIOLET-GREEN CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax pelagicus robustus._\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is found on the Pacific coast from Washington to the\r\nAleutian Islands. Their habits and nests and eggs are the same as those\r\nof the Pelagic Cormorant, nesting on the high cliffs of the rocky\r\nislands. The eggs are the same size as those of the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n123b. BAIRD'S CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax pelagicus resplendens._\r\n\r\nThis variety breeds on the Pacific coast from Washington south to\r\nMexico. They nest on the Farallones, but in smaller numbers than the\r\nother varieties found there. Both the birds and their eggs are smaller\r\nthan the preceding. Size of eggs 2.20 × 1.40.\r\n\r\n\r\n124. RED-FACED CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax urile._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwest coast of Alaska, migrating to Japan in the winter.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from the Pelagic chiefly in having the forehead\r\nbare. They do not differ in their breeding habits from others of the\r\nfamily. That the Cormorants are expert fishermen may be seen from the\r\nfact that the Chinese tame and have them catch fish for them, placing a\r\nring around their neck to prevent their swallowing the fish. Their\r\nnesting places are very filthy, being covered with excrement and remains\r\nof fish that are strewn around the nests. They breed in June laying\r\nthree or four eggs. Size 2.50 × 1.50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 084: 120c--122.]\r\n[Illustration: 123b--124.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 83\r\n\r\nPELICANS. Family PELECANIDÆ\r\n\r\nPelicans are large, short legged, web footed (all four toes joined by a\r\nweb) birds, the most noticeable feature of which is the long bill with\r\nits enormous pouch suspended from lower mandible. This pouch, while\r\nnormally contracted, is capable of being distended to hold several\r\nquarts. It is used as a scoop in which to catch small fish. Their skin\r\nis filled with numerous air cells, making them very light and buoyant.\r\n\r\n\r\n125. AMERICAN WHITE PELICAN. _Pelecanus erythrorhynchos._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, breeding in the interior, from Utah and\r\nthe Dakotas northward. These large birds, reaching a length of five\r\nfeet, are entirely white except for the black primaries. They get their\r\nfood by approaching a school of small fish and, suddenly dipping their\r\nhead beneath the surface, sometimes scoop up a large number of fish at a\r\ntime; after allowing the water to run out of the sides of the mouth,\r\nthey proceed to swallow their catch. They nest in large communities on\r\nislands in some of the inland lakes.\r\n\r\nGreat Salt Lake, Utah, and Shoal Lake, Manitoba, furnish breeding ground\r\nfor many thousands of Pelicans. They build their simple nests on the\r\nground, making them of sticks and weeds. They generally lay two eggs,\r\nbut often three or four. Size 3.45 × 2.30. Data.--Egg Island, Great Salt\r\nLake, June 19, 1884. Two eggs. Nest a slight hollow in the ground,\r\nsurrounded by a few sticks. Collector, F. F. Leonard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 085: Chalky white.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 84\r\n\r\n[Illustration 086: AMERICAN WHITE PELICAN.]\r\n\r\nPage 85\r\n\r\n126. BROWN PELICAN. _Pelecanus occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Found on the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBrown Pelicans are about 50 inches in length; they have a blackish and\r\ngrayish body and a white head and neck with a brown stripe down the back\r\nof the latter. The pouch is a dark greenish brown. This species is\r\nmaritime and is not found inland. They breed in large colonies on many\r\nof the islands in the Gulf of Mexico and on Pelican Island on the east\r\ncoast of Florida, in which latter place they are now protected from\r\nfurther depredations at the hand of eggers and gunners. Their fishing\r\ntactics differ from those of the White Pelican. They dive down upon the\r\nschool of fish from the air and rarely miss making a good catch. Their\r\nnests are quite bulky structures made of sticks and weeds and grasses.\r\nThese are generally located on the ground but occasionally in low\r\nmangroves, these latter nests being more bulky than the ground ones.\r\nThey lay from two to five chalky white eggs during May and June. Size 3.\r\n× 1.90. Data.--Tampa Bay, Fla., May 29, 1894. Three eggs. Nest in the\r\ntop of a stout mangrove; made of sticks, branches and leaves. Collector,\r\nGeo. Graham.\r\n\r\n\r\n127. CALIFORNIA BROWN PELICAN. _Pelecanus californicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from British Columbia south to the Galapagos\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThis bird is similar to the preceding, but larger and the pouch is\r\nreddish. They breed abundantly on the Coronado Islands and southward.\r\nTheir habits, nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of the Brown\r\nPelican. Size of the three or four chalky white eggs is 3.10 × 1.95.\r\nData.--Coronado Islands, Calif., March 28, 1897. Three eggs. Nest of\r\nsticks, lined with green leaves, located on the ground.

MAN-O'-WAR BIRD. _Fregata aquila._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical seas, north regularly in America to the South Atlantic\r\nand Gulf coasts, casually farther.\r\n\r\nMan-o'-war Birds or \"Frigates,\" as they are often called, are remarkable\r\nbirds in many respects. In comparison with their weight they have the\r\nlargest expanse of wing of any known bird. Weighing only about four\r\npounds they have an extent of from seven to eight feet, their wings\r\nbeing extremely long and pointed. The length of the bird is about 40\r\ninches, of which the tail comprises about 18 in., 10 inches of this\r\nbeing forked. They have a large bright orange gular sac, a long, hooked\r\nbill, and small slightly webbed feet. Their powers of flight combine the\r\nstrength of the Albatrosses and the grace of the Terns. They are very\r\npoor swimmers and do not dive, so are forced to procure their food by\r\npreying upon the Gulls and Cormorants, forcing them to drop their fish,\r\nwhich the pirates catch before it reaches the water. They also feed upon\r\nflying fish, catching them in the air, whither they have been driven by\r\ntheir enemies in their natural element. They nest in large colonies on\r\nsome of the Bahama Islands and on some of the small Florida Keys. Their\r\nnests are small frail platforms of sticks and twigs and the single egg\r\nis laid in March and April. It is white and has a smooth surface. Size\r\n2.80 × 1.90. Data.--Key Verde, Bahamas, March 6, 1889. Single egg. Nest\r\na frail affair of sticks on a cactus. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 088: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Man-O'-War Bird.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 87\r\n\r\nOrder V. ANSERES\r\nDUCKS, GEESE AND SWANS. Family ANATIDAE\r\n\r\nThe birds comprising this family are of greatly varying sizes, but all\r\nhave webbed feet, and generally the bill is broader than high, and is\r\nserrated on the edges or provided with gutters to act as a strainer in\r\nassisting the birds to gather their food.\r\n\r\n\r\n129. MERGANSER. _Mergus americanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from the northern border of the United\r\nStates northward.\r\n\r\nThe three species of Mergansers are almost exclusively fish eating\r\nbirds. Therefore their flesh is unpalatable and they are known as \"Fish\r\nDucks.\" They are also sometimes called \"Sawbills\" because of the\r\nteeth-like serration on both the upper and the under mandibles. Unlike\r\nthe other species of ducks, their bills are long, slender and rounded\r\ninstead of being broad and flat; it is also hooked at the tip. Like the\r\nCormorants, they often pursue and catch fish under the water, their\r\nteeth-like bills enabling them to firmly hold their prey.\r\n\r\nThe American Mergansers, Goosanders, or Sheldrakes, as they are often\r\ncalled, are found both on the coast and in the interior. Except in\r\ncertain mountainous regions, they breed chiefly north of the United\r\nStates. The male bird has no crest and the head is a beautiful green,\r\nwhile the female has a reddish brown crest and head, shading to white on\r\nthe chin. They build their nest in hollow trees near the water. It is\r\nmade of grasses, leaves and moss and is lined with feathers from the\r\nbreast of the female. During May, they lay from six to ten eggs of a\r\ncreamy or buff color. Size 2.70 × 1.75. Data.--Gun Is., Lake Winnipeg.\r\nJune 16, 1903. Eleven eggs in a nest of white down, located between two\r\nlarge boulders. Collector, Walter Raine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 089: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: American Merganser.

RED-BREASTED MERGANSER. _Mergus serrator._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from northern United States northward.\r\n\r\nThis species is more abundant than the preceding. It is slightly\r\nsmaller, being 22 inches in length, and the male is crested. Found\r\nabundantly in the United States in winter. Breeds commonly in the\r\ninterior of British America and in Labrador and Newfoundland. They make\r\ntheir nests on the ground, near the water, concealing them under rocks\r\nor tufts of grass. The nest is made of grasses, leaves and moss and\r\nlined with feathers. They lay, generally, about ten eggs of a buffy or\r\ngreenish buff color. Size 2.50 × 1.70. Data.--Lake Manitoba, N. W.\r\nCanada. Two eggs in a hollow lined with down, under a patch of rose\r\nbushes near shore. Collector, Jos. Hamaugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n131. HOODED MERGANSER. _Lophodytes cucullatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding locally throughout its range, in the\r\ninterior. These are beautiful little Ducks distinguished from all others\r\nby the semi-circular, compressed crest which is black with an enclosed\r\nwhite area. They make their nests in hollow trees, in wooded districts\r\nnear the water, lining the cavity with grasses and down. They lay ten or\r\ntwelve grayish white eggs. Size 2.15 × 1.70.\r\n\r\n\r\n132. MALLARD. _Anas platyrhynchos._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in America from northern United\r\nStates northward, and wintering south to Panama and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nContrasting with the preceding Fish Ducks, the Mallards are regarded as\r\none of the most esteemed table birds. They feed on mollusks and marine\r\ninsects which they generally reach by tipping in shallow water. They\r\nnest in many localities in the United States but more abundantly north\r\nof our borders. They nest in fields in close proximity to ponds or\r\nlakes, placing their nests of grasses and feathers in the tall grass. In\r\nMay and June they lay from six to ten eggs of a buffy or olive color.\r\nSize 2.25 × 1.25. Data.--San Diego, California, May 19, 1897. Nest made\r\nof grass, lined with down, placed on the edge of a field near a pond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 090: Hooded Merganser.

BLACK DUCK. _Anas rubripes._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from the middle portions north\r\nto the Hudson Bay territory and Labrador.\r\n\r\nThroughout their breeding region, one or more pairs of these ducks nest\r\nin nearly every favorable locality. Their nests are placed on the ground\r\nin marshes, swamps or fields bordering a pond or lake, the nest being\r\nconcealed in the long grass or reeds. They breed in equal abundance,\r\neither in the interior or along the sea coast; in the latter case their\r\nnests are often placed beside of, or under an overhanging rock. It is\r\nmade of weeds, grass and moss and is lined with feathers and down. They\r\nlay from six to twelve eggs during May and June; these are buff or\r\ngreenish buff in color. Size 2.30 × 1.70. Data.--Duck Is., Maine, June\r\n3, 1893. Nest of grasses, concealed in a large tuft on water's edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n134. FLORIDA DUCK. _Anas fulvigula fulvigula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and the Gulf of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThis is a similar, lighter colored, locally distributed race of the\r\nforegoing. The most noticeable difference in plumage between this and\r\nthe Black Duck is the absence of markings on the chin. The habits are\r\nthe same, and the eggs, which are deposited in April, are similar to\r\nthose of the Black Duck, but smaller. Size 2.15 × 1.60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 092: Pale greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Black Duck.

MOTTLED DUCK. _Anas fulvigula maculosa._\r\n\r\nRange.--Gulf coast of Texas and up the Mississippi Valley to Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe habits of this bird differ in no way from the preceding ones. The\r\nsix to ten eggs are greenish buff in color. Size 2.15 × 1.55.\r\n\r\n\r\n135. GADWALL. _Chaulelasmus streperus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in America, chiefly in the United\r\nStates and north to Manitoba, chiefly in the interior.\r\n\r\nSouth in winter to the Gulf. The males of these birds may be identified\r\nby the white speculum and the chestnut wing coverts. Gadwalls nest on\r\nthe ground among the reeds of marshes or in the long grass of bordering\r\nfields; they make little or no nest but line the cavity with down from\r\ntheir breasts. They lay from seven to twelve eggs of a creamy buff\r\ncolor. Size 2.10 × 1.60. Data.--Benson Co., North Dakota, June 19, 1898.\r\nEight eggs. Nest on the ground among rank grass on a low island in\r\nDevils Lake. Made of weeds lined with down. Collector, E. S. Rolfe.\r\n\r\n\r\n136. WIDGEON. _Mareca penelope_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in America, only in the Aleutian\r\nIslands; rare or accidental in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe European Widgeon is similar in build and plumage to the following\r\nspecies, except that the whole head, with the exception of the white\r\ncrown, is chestnut. They build their nests in the rushes, making them of\r\nreeds and grass and lining them with feathers. They lay from six to ten\r\nlight buff colored eggs. Size 2.20 × 1.50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 093: Creamy buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Gadwall. Widgeon.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 92\r\n\r\n137. BALDPATE. _Mareca americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding in the interior from Texas north to\r\nHudson Bay.\r\n\r\nThe Baldpate (so-called because of the white crown) or American Widgeon\r\nis a handsomely marked bird and is regarded as a great table delicacy.\r\nThe male birds cannot be mistaken for any other species because of the\r\nwhite crown, wing coverts and underparts and the broad green stripe,\r\nback of the eye. They breed locally in many parts of the country,\r\nbuilding their nests of grass and weeds, neatly lined with feathers, on\r\nthe ground in marshes. They lay from six to twelve creamy eggs. Size\r\n2.15 × 1.50. Data.--Lac Aux Morts, North Dakota. Eight eggs. Nest of\r\ngrass and down on ground in a grassy meadow. Collector, E. S. Bryant.\r\n\r\n\r\n138. EUROPEAN TEAL. _Nettion crecca._\r\n\r\nAn old world species that is casually found on both coasts of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n139. GREEN-WINGED TEAL. _Nettion carolinense._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding chiefly north of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA small, handsome species, the male of which can readily be identified\r\nby the reddish brown head and neck, with the large green patch behind\r\neach ear; length fourteen inches. Green-winged Teals are our smallest\r\nrepresentative of the Duck family. They are eagerly sought by sportsmen,\r\nboth because of their beauty and the excellence of their flesh. They are\r\namong the most common of Ducks in the interior, where they nest\r\ngenerally in tufts of grass along ponds, lakes or brooks. Nest of grass\r\nand weeds, lined with down from the bird. Eggs buffy, four to ten in\r\nnumber. Size 1.85 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 094: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Baldpate. Green-winged Teal.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 93\r\n\r\n140. BLUE-WINGED TEAL. _Querquedula discors_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from northern United States northward;\r\nrare on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nAnother small species, known by the blue wing coverts and the white\r\ncrescent in front of eye. They nest in the same localities with the\r\npreceding species, placing their nest of grass and weeds on the ground\r\nin meadows near water. Eggs buffy white. Six to twelve in number. Size\r\n1.90 × 1.30.\r\n\r\n\r\n141. CINNAMON TEAL. _Querquedula cyanoptera_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, chiefly west of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nCasually east to Texas, Illinois and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe Cinnamon Teal is another small Duck, marked by the uniform rich\r\nchestnut plumage and light blue wing coverts. The speculum is green. The\r\nnesting habits are the same as those of the Teals, the nests being\r\nplaced on the ground in marshes or fields near water. Their nests are\r\nclosely woven of grass and weeds and lined with down and feathers from\r\nthe breast of the bird. The eggs are pale buff and number from six to\r\nfourteen. Size 1.85 × 1.35.\r\n\r\n\r\n141.1. RUDDY SHELDRAKE. _Casarca ferruginea._\r\n\r\nThis is an Old World species that has accidentally occurred in\r\nGreenland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 095: Blue-winged Teal. Cinnamon Teal.]\r\n[Illustration: deco-photo.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 94\r\n\r\n142. SHOVELLER. _Spatula clypeata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding in the interior from Texas\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nThis strikingly marked Duck is twenty inches in length, has a green head\r\nand speculum, blue wing coverts and chestnut belly. The bill is long and\r\nbroad at the tip. It makes its nest on the ground in marshy places, of\r\ngrass, weeds and feathers. Six to ten eggs constitute a complete set.\r\nThey are greenish or leaden gray color. Size 2.10 x 1.50.\r\nData.--Graham's Island, North Dakota, May 28, 1899. Nest of dead weed\r\nstems and grass, lined with down. Ten eggs. Collector, E. S. Bryant.\r\n\r\n\r\n143. PINTAIL. _Dafila acuta._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in North America from northern\r\nUnited States northward, wintering south to Panama. This species, which\r\nis also known as the Sprig-tail, is very common in the United States in\r\nthe spring and fall migrations. It is about thirty inches long, its\r\nlength depending upon the development of the tail feathers, the central\r\nones of which are long and pointed. They breed casually in many sections\r\nof the United States, but in abundance from Manitoba to the Arctic\r\nOcean. They nest near the water, laying from six to twelve eggs of dull\r\nolive color. Size 2.20 x 1.50. Data.--Graham's Island, Devil's Lake, N.\r\nDakota, June 15, 1900. Ten eggs. Nest on the ground, of weeds, lined\r\nwith down. Colony breeding. Collector, E. S. Bryant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 096: Lead gray.]\r\n[Illustration: Pintail. Shoveller.]\r\n[Illustration: Dull olive gray.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 95\r\n\r\n144. WOOD DUC. _Aix sponsa._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, breeding from Labrador and British\r\nColumbia south to Florida.\r\n\r\nBridal Duck is a name often given to this, the most beautiful of all\r\nDucks.\r\n\r\nThey are beautifully marked, have a large crest, and are iridescent with\r\nall colors of the rainbow. They frequent wooded country near ponds and\r\nlakes, feeding on water insects and mollusks in the coves. They build\r\ntheir nests in hollow trees and stumps, often at quite a distance from\r\nthe water. When the young are a few days old, they slide, scramble, or\r\nflutter down the tree trunk to the ground below, and are led to the\r\nwater. The nest is made of twigs, weeds and grass, and warmly lined with\r\ndown. The eggs are a buff color and number eight to fifteen. Size 2. ×\r\n1.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n145. RUFOUS-CRESTED DUCK. _Netta rufina._\r\n\r\nA European species; a single specimen taken on Long Island in 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n146. REDHEAD. _Marila americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America at large, breeding from northern United States\r\nnorthward, chiefly in the interior.\r\n\r\nA bird commonly seen in the markets where it is often sold as the\r\nfollowing species because of their similarity. The nests are placed on\r\nthe ground in marshes or sloughs, and are made of grasses, lined with\r\nfeathers. Eggs from six to fourteen in number, of a buffy white color.\r\nSize 2.40 × 1.70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 097: Rich buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Wood Duck.

CANVAS-BACK. _Marila valisineria._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding chiefly in the interior from\r\nthe United States to the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nA noted table bird, especially in the south where it feeds on wild\r\ncelery. Can be distinguished from the Redhead by its darker head,\r\nlighter back, and gradually sloping bill. They nest abundantly in\r\nManitoba, their habits being the same as the preceding. They lay from\r\nsix to ten eggs of a darker shade than the Red-heads. Size 2.40 × 1.70.\r\nData.--Haunted Lake, N. Alberta, June 12, 1897. Ten eggs. Nest of reeds\r\nin a heavy reed bed out in the lake. Collector, Walter Raine.\r\n\r\n\r\n148. SCAUP DUCK. _Marila marila._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from North Dakota northward, chiefly in\r\nthe interior; south in winter to Central America.\r\n\r\nThis and the following species are widely known as \"Blue-bills\" owing to\r\nthe slaty blue color of that member. Their plumage is black and white,\r\nsomewhat similar in pattern to that of the Redhead, but darker, and the\r\nwhole head is black. They nest in marshes about many of the ponds and\r\nlakes in the interior of British America. The nest is made of marsh\r\ngrasses and lined with feathers. The six to ten eggs are pale grayish or\r\ngreenish gray. Size 2.50 × 1.70. Data.--Saltcoats Marshes, N. W. Canada,\r\nJune 15, 1901. Ten eggs. Nest in the grass; a depression lined with down\r\nand dried grasses. Collector, Walter Raine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANVAS-BACK. American Scaup Duck.]\r\n[Illustration 099: Pale greenish gray.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 98\r\n\r\n149. LESSER SCAUP DUCK. _Marila affinis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from North Dakota and British Columbia\r\nnorthward; winters south to Central America.\r\n\r\nThis Duck is distinguished from the preceding, chiefly by its size which\r\nis about two inches less, or 17 inches in length. The nesting habits are\r\nthe same as those of the Greater Scaup and the eggs are similar but\r\nsmaller. Size 2.25 × 1.55. Data.--Northern Assiniboia, June 10, 1901.\r\nTen eggs on grass and down at the edge of a lagoon. Collector, Walter\r\nRaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n150. RING-NECKED DUCK. _Marila collaris._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding in the interior, from North Dakota and\r\nWashington northward. Winters from Maryland on the east and British\r\nColumbia on the west to Central America.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Lesser Scaup in size and plumage, except that it has a\r\nnarrow chestnut collar around the neck, the back is black instead of\r\nbarred with white, and the speculum is gray instead of white. The habits\r\nand nesting habits of the Ring-neck do not differ from those of the\r\nother Scaups. They lay from six to twelve eggs. Size 2.25 × 1.60.\r\nData.--Cape Bathurst, N. Y. T., June 18, 1901. Ten eggs in a slight\r\nhollow in the moss, lined with down. Collector, Captain Bodfish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 100: Lesser Scaup Duck. Ring-necked Duck.]\r\n[Illustration: Lead gray.]\r\n[Illustration: deco-photo.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 99\r\n\r\n151. GOLDEN-EYE. _Clangula clangula americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding both on the coast and in the interior,\r\nfrom the northern border of the United States northward to the Arctic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nThese are handsome Ducks known as \"Whistlers\" from the noise of their\r\nwings when flying, and \"Greatheads\" because of the puffy crest. The head\r\nis greenish with a large round white spot in front of, and a little\r\nbelow the eye. The rest of the plumage is black and white. This species\r\nnests in hollow trees near the water, lining the cavity with grass, moss\r\nand leaves, and lining the nest with down from their breasts. In May and\r\nJune they lay from six to ten eggs of a grayish green color. Size 2.30 ×\r\n1.70.\r\n\r\n\r\n152. BARROW'S GOLDEN-EYE. _Clangula islandica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, breeding north of the United States\r\nexcept from the mountainous portions of Colorado northward.\r\n\r\nThis Golden-eye differs from the preceding chiefly in the shape of the\r\nwhite spot before the eye, which in this species is in the form of a\r\ncrescent. The size is the same, about 20 inches in length. The\r\nreflections on the head are purplish rather than greenish as in the\r\npreceding. The nesting habits are the same, they building in hollow\r\ntrees near water. The six to ten eggs are not different from the\r\npreceding. Size 2.30 × 1.65. Data.--Alfusa, Iceland, June 30, 1900.\r\nSeven eggs. Nest of grass and down in a box attached to a tree by an\r\nislander.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 101: Grayish green.]\r\n[Illustration: American Golden-eye. Barrow Golden-eye.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 100\r\n\r\n153. BUFFLE-HEAD. _Charitonetta albeola._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from United States northward. Winters\r\nsouth to Mexico.\r\n\r\nGunners know this handsome little duck by the names of \"Butter-ball,\"\r\nand \"Dipper,\" a name also given to Grebes. It is also quite similar, but\r\nsmaller (15 in. long), to the American Golden-eye but has a large white\r\npatch on the back of the head, from eye to eye. It is an active bird\r\nand, like the two preceding, is capable of diving to a great depth to\r\nget its food. Its nesting habits are like the preceding. Eggs eight to\r\nfourteen. Size 2 × 1.40. Data.--Alberta, Canada, June 6, 1899. Seven\r\neggs. Nest in hole in tree stump, lined with down. Collector, Dr.\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n\r\n154. OLD-SQUAW. _Harelda hyemalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the Arctic regions; south in\r\nwinter to New Jersey and Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe Long-tailed Duck, as it is called, is especially noticeable because\r\nthe breeding plumage of the male differs markedly from that in the\r\nwinter. In summer their general plumage is blackish brown, with a white\r\npatch around the eye, and white belly. In winter they are largely white.\r\nThe central tail feathers are much lengthened. They breed abundantly in\r\nGreenland, Alaska and the Hudson Bay Territory, placing their nests of\r\ngrasses and weeds on the ground near the water. It is generally\r\nconcealed in the long grass. The eggs number from six to twelve. Size 2.\r\n× 1.50. Data.--N. Iceland, June 10, 1900. Nest on ground, lined with\r\ndown. Collector, S. H. Wallis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 102: Dull buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Buffle-head. Old-squaw.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 101\r\n\r\n155. HARLEQUIN DUCK. _Histrionicus histrionicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere in America, breeding from Newfoundland and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains in Colorado, northward. South in winter to\r\nCalifornia and New England.\r\n\r\nA beautiful and most gorgeous bird, not in colors, but in the oddity of\r\nthe markings, the colors only including black, white, gray and chestnut.\r\nEither sex can be recognized by the small short bill. They breed mostly\r\nin single pairs along swiftly running streams, placing their nest, which\r\nis woven of weeds and grasses, in the ground near the water. It is also\r\nclaimed that they sometimes nest in hollow trees. They lay from five to\r\neight eggs, yellowish or greenish buff in color. Size 2.30 × 1.60.\r\nData.--Peel River, Alaska, June 13, 1898. Seven eggs in a hollow in\r\nriver bank, lined with down. Collector, C. E. Whittaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n156. LABRADOR DUCK. _Camptorhynchus labradorius._\r\n\r\nThis bird, whose range was from Labrador to New Jersey in the winter,\r\nhas probably been extinct since 1875, when the last authentic capture\r\nwas made. It is a strange fact that a bird of this character should have\r\nbeen completely exterminated, even though they were often sold in the\r\nmarkets. Only forty-one specimens are known to be preserved at present\r\nand nothing is known in regard to their nesting habits or eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 103: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Harlequin Duck. Labrador Duck.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 102\r\n\r\n157. STELLER'S DUCK. _Polysticta stelleri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions in America, chiefly on the Aleutian Islands and\r\nnorthwest coast of Alaska.\r\n\r\nA very beautiful species eighteen inches long; head white, washed with\r\ngreenish on the forehead and nape; chin, throat, neck, back, tail and\r\ncrissum, black; underparts chestnut; wing coverts white, the long\r\nscapulars black and white. It breeds on the rocky coasts and islands of\r\nBering Sea. The six to nine eggs are pale olive green in color. Size\r\n2.25 × 1.60. Data.--Admiralty Bay, Alaska, June 22, 1898. Nest on a\r\nhummock of the tundra, near a small pool, lined with grass and down.\r\nCollector, E. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n\r\n158. SPECTACLED EIDER. _Arctonetta fischeri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of Alaska from the Aleutians to Point Barrow.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the true Eiders, this species is black beneath and\r\nmostly white above. The head is largely washed with sea green, leaving a\r\nlarge patch of white, narrowly bordered by black around each eye, thus\r\nresembling a pair of spectacles. The nests are made of grass and seaweed\r\nand lined with down; they are placed on the ground in clumps of grass or\r\nbeneath overhanging stones. The five to nine eggs are an olive drab or\r\ngreenish color. Size 2.70 × 1.85. Data.--Point Barrow, Alaska, June 15,\r\n1898. Six eggs. Nest of moss and down in a hollow in dry tundra.\r\nCollector, E. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n\r\n159. NORTHERN EIDER. _Somateria mollissima borealis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Atlantic coast, breeding from Labrador to Greenland and\r\nwintering south to New England.\r\n\r\nA large Duck similar to the next species, but with the base of the bill\r\ndiffering, as noted in the description of the following species, and\r\nwith a more northerly distribution. The nesting habits are the same as\r\nthose of the other Eiders. Six to ten eggs generally of a greenish drab\r\ncolor. Size 3. × 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 104: Steller's Duck. Spectacled Eider.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale olive green.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 103\r\n\r\n160. EIDER. _Somateria dresseri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Atlantic coast, breeding from Maine to Labrador and wintering\r\nsouth to Delaware.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from the preceding only in the fleshy part of the\r\nbase of the bill, which extends back on each side of the forehead, it\r\nbeing broad and rounded in this species and narrow and pointed in the\r\nNorthern or Greenland Eider. This species, but more especially the\r\nNorthern Eider, are the ones chiefly used for the eider-down of\r\ncommerce. The preceding species is often semi-domesticated in Greenland,\r\nthe people protecting them and encouraging them to nest in the\r\nneighborhood. They make their nests of seaweed and grass and warmly line\r\nit with down from their breast; this down is continually added to the\r\nnest during incubation until there is a considerable amount in each\r\nnest, averaging about an ounce in weight. The birds are among the\r\nstrongest of the sea ducks and get their food in very deep water. Their\r\nflesh is not good eating. Their eggs number from five to ten and are\r\ngreenish drab. Size 3. × 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n161. PACIFIC EIDER. _Somateria v-nigra._\r\n\r\nRange.--North Pacific from the Aleutian Islands northward, and east to\r\nGreat Slave Lake.\r\n\r\nThis bird is, in plumage, like the Northern Eider, except that it has a\r\nblack V-shaped mark on the throat. They nest sparingly on the Aleutian\r\nIslands, but in great numbers farther north on the coast about Point\r\nBarrow. Their habits, nests and eggs are precisely the same as those of\r\nthe eastern forms. Their eggs number from five to ten and are of olive\r\ngreenish color. Size 3. × 2. Data.--Cape Smythe, Alaska, June 8, 1900.\r\nEight eggs. Nest a hollow in the moss, lined with grass and down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 105: Greenish drab.]\r\n[Illustration: Eider. Pacific Eider.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 104\r\n\r\n162. KING EIDER. _Somateria spectabilis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in America from Labrador to\r\nGreenland and the Arctic Ocean; south in winter to the New England\r\nStates and rarely farther on the eastern side, and to the Aleutians on\r\nthe Pacific; also casually to the Great Lakes in the interior.\r\n\r\nA handsome and very different species from any of the foregoing, having\r\nthe crown ashy blue, and the long scapulars black instead of white. It\r\nalso has a broad V-shaped mark on the throat. Like all the other Eiders,\r\nthe female is mottled brown and black, the different species being very\r\ndifficult to separate. The nests are sunk in the ground and lined with\r\ndown. Eggs number from six to ten. Size 2.80 × 1.80. Data.--Point\r\nBarrow, Alaska, July 5, 1898. Five eggs. Nest a hollow in the moss on\r\ntundra lined with moss and down. Collector, E. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n\r\n163. SCOTER. _Oidemia americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, breeding from Labrador, the Hudson Bay\r\nregion and the Aleutian Islands northward; winters south to Virginia,\r\nthe Great Lakes and California.\r\n\r\nScoters or \"Coots\" as they are generally called are sea ducks whose\r\nplumage is almost wholly black; they have fantastically colored and\r\nshaped bills. The American Scoter is entirely black without markings;\r\nbase of bill yellow and orange. This species nest as do the Eiders,\r\noften concealing the nest, of grass and feathers, under some overhanging\r\nrock. They lay from six to ten eggs of a dingy buff color. Size 2.50 ×\r\n1.70. Data.--Mackenzie Bay, June 15, 1899. Ten eggs. Nest a hollow in\r\nthe sand, lined with down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 106: King Eider. Scoter.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 105\r\n\r\n164. VELVET SCOTER. _Oidemia fusca._\r\n\r\nAn Old World species that has accidentally occurred in Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\n165. WHITE-WINGED SCOTER. _Oidemia deglandi_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Abundant in North America, breeding from Labrador, North Dakota\r\nand British Columbia, northward. Wintering south to the Middle States,\r\nsouthern Illinois and southern California.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the Scoters, length 22 inches, distinguished by a large\r\nwhite speculum on the wing, also a white comet extending from under the\r\neye backwards. It also has a yellow eye. Like the other Scoters, this\r\nspecies often feeds in very deep water. They are strong, active diving\r\nbirds, and are also strong on the wing, generally flying close to the\r\nsurface of the water. Their flesh is not regarded as good eating,\r\nalthough they are often sold for that purpose. They nest on the ground,\r\ngenerally in long grass or under low bushes making a coarse nest of\r\ngrasses, and sometimes twigs, lined with feathers. They lay from five to\r\neight eggs of a pale buff color. Size 2.75 × 1.85.\r\n\r\n\r\n166. SURF SCOTER. _Oidemia perspicillata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, breeding north of the United States\r\nboundary, and wintering south to Virginia and southern California.\r\n\r\nThe male of this species is entirely black, except for the white patches\r\non the forehead and nape, and the vari-colored bill of black, white,\r\npink and yellow. They nest either along the coast or in the interior,\r\nbuilding a nest lined with down, in the marsh grass bordering small\r\nponds. They lay from five to eight buffy cream colored eggs. Size 2.40 ×\r\n1.70. The females of all the Scoters are a dingy brownish color, but\r\nshow the characteristic marking of the species, although the white is\r\ngenerally dull or sometimes mottled. Data.--Mackenzie River, June 25,\r\n1894. Six eggs in a nest of down on an island in the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 107: Surf Scoter. White-winged Scoter.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 106\r\n\r\n167. RUDDY DUCK. _Erismatura jamaicensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding chiefly north of the United\r\nStates border except locally on the Pacific coast. Winters along the\r\nGulf and through Mexico and Central America.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar species may always be recognized by the brownish or\r\nchestnut upper parts, blackish crown, white cheeks and silvery white\r\nunderparts. The bill is very stout and broad at the end, and the tail\r\nfeathers are stiff and pointed like those of a Cormorant. They build\r\ntheir nests in low marshy places, either placing them on the ground near\r\nthe water or in the rushes over it. Their nests are made of rushes and\r\ngrasses, sometimes lined and sometimes not, with down from the parents\r\nbreast. The eggs number from six to twelve and are grayish in color.\r\nSize 2.40 × 1.75. Data.--Northern Assiniboia, Canada, June 6, 1901.\r\nEight eggs. Nest made of aquatic grasses, lined with down. Built in a\r\ntuft of rushes in a marsh. Collector, Walter Raine.\r\n\r\n\r\n168. MASKED DUCK. _Nomonyx dominicus._\r\n\r\nThis is a tropical species which is resident in Mexico, Central America\r\nand in the West Indies. It occurs in Mexico north to the lower Rio\r\nGrande Valley and has in three known instances strayed to northern\r\nUnited States. The general plumage is a rusty chestnut, mottled with\r\nblackish, it has a black face and throat, with white wing bars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 108: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Ruddy Duck. Masked Duck.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 107\r\n\r\n169. SNOW GOOSE. _Chen hyperboreus hyperboreus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Mississippi Valley, breeding in\r\nnorthern Alaska and the MacKenzie River district.\r\n\r\nThis smaller species of the Snow Goose nests on islands in rivers along\r\nthe arctic coast. The nest is a depression in the ground, lined with\r\ngrasses and, occasionally down. They lay from four to eight eggs of a\r\nbuffy or yellowish white color. Size 2.75 × 1.75.\r\n\r\n\r\n169a. GREATER SNOW GOOSE. _Chen hyperboreus nivalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and\r\nwintering chiefly on the Atlantic coast, south to Cuba.\r\n\r\nThis bird is like the preceding; except in size; about thirty-six\r\ninches, instead of twenty-six inches in length as is the lesser variety.\r\nThe entire plumage is white except for the black primaries. They\r\nconstruct their nests of grasses on the ground the same as the preceding\r\nvariety. The eggs number from five to eight and are cream colored. Size\r\n3.40 × 2.40.\r\n\r\n\r\n169.1. BLUE GOOSE. _Chen cærulescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, principally in the interior, breeding from Hudson\r\nBay northward and wintering along the Gulf coast.\r\n\r\nThis species may always be recognized by the entirely white head and\r\nneck, the body being grayish or bluish gray. They nest on the ground as\r\ndo the other geese laying from four to eight eggs of a brownish buff\r\ncolor. Size 2.50 × 1.75. Data,--Cape Bathurst, Arctic coast, June 29,\r\n1899. Four eggs laid in a depression lined with grass, on an island.\r\nCollected with the parent birds by the Esquimaux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 109: Grayish White.]\r\n[Illustration: Lesser Snow Goose. Blue Goose.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 108\r\n\r\n170. ROSS'S SNOW GOOSE. _Chen rossi._\r\n\r\nRange.--This beautiful species, which is similar in plumage to the large\r\nSnow Goose, is but twenty-one inches in length. It breeds in the extreme\r\nnorth, and in winter is found in the western part of the United States\r\nas far south as the Gulf of Mexico. Their nesting habits and eggs\r\nprobably do not differ from others in the family except in the matter of\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\n171. WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE. _Anser albifrons albifrons._\r\n\r\nThis European species is exactly like the American except that it is\r\nsaid to average a trifle smaller. It is occasionally found in Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\n171a. AMERICAN WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE. _Anser albifrons gambeli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and\r\nwintering south to the Gulf coast; not common on the Atlantic coast\r\nduring migrations.\r\n\r\nThese birds may be recognized by their mottled plumage, dark head and\r\nwhite forehead. This species is more abundant than any of the preceding\r\nand nests in large colonies along the arctic coast and in Alaska. Their\r\nnests are made of dried grasses, feathers and down and are placed on the\r\nground in a slight depression. From four to nine eggs are laid; these\r\nhave a dull buff ground. Size 3.00 × 2.05. Data.--Island in delta of\r\nMackenzie River, June 10, 1899. Four eggs. Nest of grass and feathers on\r\nthe ground on a small island. Collector, Rev. I. O. Stringer.\r\n\r\n\r\n171.1. BEAN GOOSE. _Anser fabalis._\r\n\r\nThis European species is casually found in Greenland. It is one of the\r\nmost common of the Old World Species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 110: Ross Snow Goose. American White-fronted Goose.]\r\n[Illustration: deco-photo.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 109\r\n\r\n172. CANADA GOOSE. _Branta canadensis canadensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--The whole of North America, breeding from northern United States\r\nnorthward, and wintering in the southern parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is the most widely known of American Geese and is the most\r\nabundant. Its familiar \"honk\" has long been regarded as the signal of\r\nthe coming of spring, and the familiar V-shaped formation in which the\r\nflocks migrate is always an object of interest to everyone. With the\r\nexception of in North Dakota and Minnesota, they breed chiefly north of\r\nthe United States. They construct quite a large nest of weeds and grass,\r\nand warmly line it with down and feathers. They lay from four to nine\r\neggs of a buff or drab color. Size about 3.50 × 2.50. Data.--Ellingsars\r\nLake, North Dakota, May 18, 1896. Five eggs. Nest on an island in the\r\nlake, constructed of weeds and trash, and lined with a few feathers.\r\nCollector, Edwin S. Bryant.\r\n\r\n\r\n172a. HUTCHINS GOOSE. _Branta canadensis hutchinsi._\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is like the preceding except that it is smaller, thirty\r\ninches in length. It is a western variety, breeding in Alaska and along\r\nthe Arctic coast and wintering to southern California. Its breeding\r\nhabits, nests and eggs are the same as the common goose except that the\r\neggs are smaller. Size 3.00 × 2.05.\r\n\r\n\r\n172b. WHITE-CHEEKED GOOSE. _Branta canadensis occidentalis._\r\n\r\nThis bird is about the same size as the Canada Goose and the plumage is\r\nvery similar except that the black sometimes extends on the throat,\r\nthereby isolating the white cheek patches, and there is a white collar\r\nbelow the back of the neck. It is a western species, breeding in Alaska\r\nand wintering along the Pacific coast of the United States. Its nesting\r\nhabits and eggs are same as those of the Canada Goose except that the\r\nlatter are a trifle smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n172c. CACKLING GOOSE. _Branta canadensis minima._\r\n\r\nThis bird is really a miniature of the Canada Goose, being but\r\ntwenty-four inches in length. It breeds in Alaska and along the Arctic\r\ncoast and migrates into the western parts of the United States. They are\r\nabundant birds in their breeding range, where they place their nests\r\nupon the shores of ponds, or on islands in inland rivers or lakes. The\r\nnests are made of weeds and grasses, lined with down. The eggs which are\r\nbuff colored, number from four to nine and are laid during June and\r\nJuly. Size 2.30 × 1.95.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 111: Canada Goose. Cackling Goose.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 110\r\n\r\n[Illustration 112: CANADA GEESE.]\r\n\r\nPage 111\r\n\r\n173. BRANT. _Branta bernicla glaucogastra._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and\r\nwintering in the United States east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe Brant resembles a small Canada Goose, except that the black of the\r\nneck extends on the breast, and only the throat is white. They are one\r\nof the favorite game birds and thousands are shot every fall and spring.\r\nTheir nests and eggs are the same as the next species.\r\n\r\n\r\n174. BLACK BRANT. _Branta nigricans._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, breeding in Alaska and wintering on the\r\nPacific coast of the United States. Rare east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis species is like the last except that the black extends on the under\r\nparts. This species nests very abundantly in northern Alaska, laying\r\ntheir eggs in a depression in the ground, lined with down. Favorite\r\nlocations are the many small islets in ponds and small lakes. They lay\r\nfrom four to eight grayish colored eggs. Size 2.80 × 1.75. Data.--Cape\r\nBathurst, North West Territory, Junes 22, 1901. Seven eggs in a small\r\nhollow in the ground, lined with down. Collector, Capt. H. H. Bodfish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 113: Brant. Black Brant.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 112\r\n\r\n175. BARNACLE GOOSE. _Branta leucopsis._\r\n\r\nThis Old World species occurs frequently in Greenland and very rarely is\r\nfound on the mainland of this continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n176. EMPEROR GOOSE. _Philacte canagica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Alaska, south in winter casually to California.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is twenty-six inches in length; it may be known\r\nfrom the mottled or \"scaly\" appearance of the body, and the white head\r\nwith a black chin and throat. While not uncommon in restricted\r\nlocalities, this may be considered as one of the most rare of North\r\nAmerican Geese. Their nests are built upon the ground and do not differ\r\nfrom those of other geese. They lay from three to seven eggs of a dull\r\nbuff color. Size 3.10 × 2.15. Data.--Stuart Island, Alaska, June 16,\r\n1900. Six eggs laid in a slight hollow in the ground, lined with a few\r\nfeathers and some down. Collector, Capt. H. H. Bodfish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 114: Barnacle Goose. Emperor Goose.]\r\n[Illustration: Egg of Canada Goose--Buffy drab.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 113\r\n\r\n177. BLACK-BELLIED TREE-DUCK. _Dendrocygna autumnalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical America, north in the Rio Grande Valley to southern\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThese peculiar long-legged Ducks are very abundant in southern Texas\r\nduring the summer months. They build their nests in hollow trees, often\r\nquite a distance from the water. They lay their eggs upon the bottom of\r\nthe cavity with only a scant lining, if any, of feathers and down. They\r\nare very prolific breeders, raising two broods in a season, each set of\r\neggs containing from ten to twenty. These eggs are creamy or pure white,\r\nsize 2.05 × 1.50. The first set is laid during the latter part of April\r\nor early in May, and fresh eggs may be found as late as July. They are\r\nespecially abundant about Brownsville and Corpus Christi, Texas.\r\nData.--Hidalgo, Mexico, May 29, 1900. Ten eggs in a hole in an old elm\r\ntree on side of lake in big woods near town. Eight feet from the ground.\r\nCollector, F. B. Armstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n178. FULVOUS TREE-DUCK. _Dendrocygna bicolor._\r\n\r\nRange.--This species is tropical like the last, but the summer range is\r\nextended to cover, casually the whole southwestern border of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis bird is long-legged like the last, but the plumage is entirely\r\ndifferent, being of a general rusty color, including the entire under\r\nparts. The nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of the\r\nBlack-bellied Duck, the white eggs being laid at the bottom of a cavity\r\nin a tree. They number from eight to (in one instance) thirty-two eggs\r\nin one nest. This species is nearly as abundant as the preceding in\r\nsouthern Texas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 115: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Black-bellied Tree duck. Fulvous Tree-duck.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 114\r\n\r\n179. WHOOPER SWAN. _Olor cygnus._\r\n\r\nThis European variety frequently is found in Greenland and formerly,\r\nregularly bred there. It nests in secluded swampy places in northern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n180. WHISTLING SWAN. _Olor columbianus._.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding in the Arctic Circle, and wintering\r\nsouth to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese birds, which are nearly five feet in length, are snow white with\r\nthe exception of the black bill and feet. The Whistling Swan is\r\ndistinguished from the next species by the presence of a small yellow\r\nspot on either side of the bill near its base. Their nests are made of a\r\nlarge mass of rubbish, weeds, grass, moss, feathers and occasionally a\r\nfew sticks. It is generally placed in a somewhat marshy place in the\r\nneighborhood of some isolated pond. The eggs are of a greenish or\r\nbrownish buff color, and number from three to six. Size 4.00 × 2.75.\r\nData.--Mackenzie River. Nest a mass of weeds, sods and grass, lined with\r\nfeathers; on an island near the mouth of the river. Collector, I. O.\r\nStringer.\r\n\r\n\r\n181. TRUMPETER SWAN. _Olor buccinator._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of North America from the Gulf of Mexico northward,\r\nbreeding from northern United States northward.\r\n\r\nThis is a magnificent bird, about five and one-half feet in length. Its\r\nplumage is exactly like that of the preceding except that the bill is\r\nentirely black, and the nostril is located nearer the eye. Their nesting\r\nhabits and eggs are the same as those of the Whistling Swan. While a few\r\npairs may breed within the United States by far the greater number are\r\nfound in the extreme north, from Hudson Bay to Alaska. The eggs may\r\naverage a trifle larger than those of the preceding species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 116: Whistling Swan.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 115\r\n\r\nLAMELLIROSTRAL GRALLATORES. Order VI. ODONTOGLOSSÆ\r\n\r\nFLAMINGOES. Family PHOENICOPTERIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n182. FLAMINGO. _Phœnicopterus ruber._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical and sub-tropical America on the Atlantic coasts,\r\nbreeding in the Bahamas and West Indies; north to Florida and casually\r\nto the South Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nThese remarkable and grotesque appearing birds attain a length of about\r\n48 inches. The plumage varies from white to a deep rosy red. It requires\r\nseveral years for them to attain the perfect adult plumage, and unlike\r\nmost birds, they are in the best of plumage during the winter, the\r\ncolors becoming faded as the nesting season approaches. The birds are\r\nespecially noticeable because of the crooked, hollow, scoop-shaped bill,\r\nand the extremely long legs and neck. The feet are webbed, but more for\r\nthe purpose of supporting them upon the mud flats than for use in\r\nswimming. The nests are usually built on a sandy point of an island;\r\nthey are mounds of earth, grass and rubbish from one to two feet in\r\nheight, the top being hollowed to receive the eggs. One or two eggs are\r\na complete set. The shell is pale blue, but this is covered with a heavy\r\nwhite chalky deposit. The eggs are laid in June and July. Size 3.40 ×\r\n2.15.\r\n\r\n\r\nIBISES, STORKS, HERONS, etc. Order VII. HERODIONES\r\n\r\nThe members of this order are wading birds, consequently they all have\r\nlong legs and necks. They have four toes, not webbed.\r\n\r\nSPOONBILLS. Family PLATALEIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n183. ROSEATE SPOONBILL. _Ajaia ajaja._.\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical America, north in summer to the Gulf States. They\r\nformerly nested in remote swamps along the whole Gulf coast, but are now\r\nconfined chiefly to the Everglades in Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 117: American Flamingo. Roseate Spoonbill.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 116\r\n\r\nThis bird, with its broad, flat bill, bare head, and rosy plumage with\r\ncarmine epaulets and tail coverts, seem more like the fanciful creation\r\nof some artist than a real bird of flesh and blood. Its plumage and\r\ncolors are strikingly clear and beautiful. Full plumaged adult birds\r\nhave very brilliant carmine shoulders and tail coverts, a saffron\r\ncolored tail, and a lengthened tuft of bright rosy feathers on the\r\nforeneck. This species breed in small colonies in marshy places, often\r\nin company with herons and ibises. Their nests are rather frail\r\nplatforms of sticks, located in bushes or trees, from four to fifteen\r\nfeet from the ground. The eggs are laid during the latter part of May\r\nand June. They are three or four in number and have a ground color of\r\ndull white, or pale greenish blue and are quite heavily blotched with\r\nseveral shades of brown. Size 2.50 × 1.70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 118: Pale greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Chalky bluish white. Egg of American Flamingo.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 117\r\n\r\nIBISES. Family IBIDIDÆ\r\n\r\nIbises are gracefully formed birds having a long curved bill and a bare\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\n184. WHITE IBIS. _Guara alba._\r\n\r\nRange.--This is a tropical and sub-tropical species which is found along\r\nthe Gulf coast, and north to South Carolina, west to Lower California.\r\n\r\nThese handsome birds are wholly white, with the exception of black\r\nprimaries. The legs and the bare skin of the face is orange red. These\r\nbirds are very abundant in most marshy localities along the Gulf coast,\r\nespecially in Florida, where they nest in rookeries of thousands of\r\nindividuals. Owing to their not having plumes, they have not been\r\npersecuted as have the white herons. They build their nests of sticks\r\nand grasses, in the mangroves a few feet above the water. In other\r\nlocalities they build their nests entirely of dead rushes, attaching\r\nthem to the standing ones a foot or more above the surface of the water.\r\nThey are quite substantially made and deeply cupped, very different from\r\nthe nests of the Herons. Their eggs are from three to five in number,\r\nvary from grayish ash to pale greenish or bluish in color, blotched with\r\nlight brown. Size 2.25 × 1.60. The nesting season is during May and\r\nJune. Data.--Tampa Bay, Fla., June 4, 1895. Three eggs. Nest of sticks\r\nand a few weeds in small bushes on an island. Collector, Fred Doane.\r\n\r\n\r\n185. SCARLET IBIS. _Guara rubra._.\r\n\r\nRange.--Occasionally, but not recently met with in the southern states.\r\nTheir habitat is tropical America, they being especially abundant along\r\nthe Orinoco River in northern South America.\r\n\r\nFull plumaged adults of this species are wholly bright scarlet, except\r\nfor the primaries, which are black. Their nests are built in\r\nimpenetrable thickets, rushes or mangroves, the nests being constructed\r\nlike those of the White Ibis. The eggs, too, are very similar to those\r\nof the preceding species, but both the ground color and the markings\r\naverage brighter. While still common in some localities, the species is\r\ngradually becoming less abundant, chiefly because of the demand for\r\ntheir feathers for use in fly-tying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 119: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: White Ibis. Scarlet Ibis.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 118\r\n\r\n186. GLOSSY IBIS. _Plegadis autumnalis._.\r\n\r\nRange.--This tropical and sub-tropical species, is chiefly found in the\r\nOld World. It is occasionally found in southeastern United States where\r\nit sometimes breeds. Its habits, nesting habits and eggs are just the\r\nsame as the next species.\r\n\r\n\r\n187. WHITE-FACED GLOSSY IBIS. _Plegadis guarauna._\r\n\r\nRange.--A sub-tropical species found in the southwestern parts of the\r\nUnited States, rarely found east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from the Glossy Ibis in having the feathers on the\r\nfront of the head white, the rest of the plumage is a dull brownish\r\nchestnut, with greenish reflections on the back. As these birds are not\r\nin demand commercially, their numbers have not decreased, and thousands\r\nof them breed in colonies in southern Texas. They build a substantial\r\nnest of reeds and rushes woven about the upright canes, close to the\r\nsurface of the water. Their eggs are laid during May, and number from\r\nthree to four. They are easily distinguished from those of the Herons,\r\nbeing of a deeper greenish blue color and averaging more elongate. Size\r\n1.95 × 1.35. Data.--Corpus Christi, Texas, May 26, 1899. Four eggs. Nest\r\nof twigs and rushes on side of river. Collector, F. B. Armstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORKS and WOOD IBISES\r\nFamily CICONIIDAE\r\n\r\n188. WOOD IBIS. _Mycteria americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--A sub-tropical species which is resident along the Gulf coast\r\nand which strays casually north to New England and Colorado.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar member of the Stork family has the whole head and part of\r\nthe neck bare and covered with numerous scales; the bill is large, long\r\nand heavy; the plumage is white, except for the black primaries and\r\ntail. It is a large bird about four feet in length. They are quite\r\nabundant in swamps along the\r\n\r\n[Illustration 120: Glossy Ibis. White-faced Glossy Ibis. Wood Ibis.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 119\r\n\r\nGulf coast, where they place their nests, which are platforms of sticks,\r\nin trees and bushes over the water. They lay three eggs which are white,\r\nand have a rough surface. Size 2.75 × 1.75.\r\n\r\n\r\n189. JABIRU. _Jabiru mycteria._\r\n\r\nThis large bird, which is the only true Stork that claims a place in our\r\navifauna, is a native of South and Central America, wandering north,\r\ncasually to Texas. Their nests are large platforms of sticks in very\r\nhigh trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTERNS and HERONS Family ARDEIDAE\r\n\r\nHerons and Bitterns are long-legged waders, having straight, pointed\r\nbills, and with the head feathered, except for the lores.\r\n\r\n\r\n190. BITTERN. _Bautaurus lentiginosus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States and southern British provinces, breeding in the\r\nnorthern half of the United States and wintering in the southern\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nThis species, with its mottled rusty brownish plumage, is one of the\r\nbest known of the Heron family. It is known locally by a great many\r\nnames, nearly all of which have reference to the \"booming\" or \"pumping\"\r\nsound made during the mating season. They build their nests in swampy or\r\nmarshy places, placing them on the ground, frequently on a tussock,\r\nentirely surrounded by water. The nest proper is only a few grasses\r\ntwisted about to form a lining to the hollow. They lay from three to\r\nfive eggs of brownish drab. Size 1.95 × 1.50.\r\n\r\nThey do not breed in colonies, generally, but one or two pairs nesting\r\nin one marsh. Data.--Worcester, Mass., June 3, 1897. Four eggs laid in a\r\ngrass lined hollow in middle of a hummock of earth and grass, in middle\r\nof marsh. Collector, James Jackson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 121: Jabiru. Bittern.]\r\n[Illustration: Brownish drab.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 120\r\n\r\n191. LEAST BITTERN. _Ixobrychus exilis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Common throughout the United States, especially in the eastern\r\npart, and in the southern British provinces.\r\n\r\nThis small variety of Bittern is very common in the southern portions of\r\nthe United States, but less so and locally distributed in the northern\r\nportions of its range. They are very quiet and sly birds, and their\r\npresence is often unsuspected when they are really quite abundant. When\r\napproached, they will remain perfectly quiet, with the body erect and\r\nthe head and neck pointed skyward, in which position their yellowish\r\nbrown plumage strongly resembles the rushes among which they are found.\r\nTheir nests are made of strips of rushes woven about upright stalks,\r\ngenerally over water. They lay from three to five eggs of a pale bluish\r\nwhite color. Size 1.20 × .90. Data.--Avery's Island, La., May 1, 1896.\r\nFour eggs. Nest of strips of rushes woven together to form a platform\r\nand fastened to saw grass growing on the bank of a stream. Collector, E.\r\nA. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n\r\n191.1. CORY'S LEAST BITTERN. _Ixobrychus neoxenus._\r\n\r\nThis rare species, of which about twenty specimens are known is probably\r\nresident in Florida, wandering north in the summer, specimens having\r\nbeen taken in Ontario, Canada, and in several localities in eastern\r\nUnited States. It is very different from the Least Bittern, having a\r\nmore uniform chestnut coloration, especially on the under parts. It is\r\ntwelve inches in length. Mr. C. W. Crandall has a set of five eggs of\r\nthis species, taken on the Caloosahatchee River, Fla., April 15, 1891,\r\nby S. B. Ladd. Nest was made of grasses and rushes placed in the cane\r\ntwo feet above the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 122: Pale bluish gray.]\r\n[Illustration: Least Bittern.

GREAT WHITE HERON. _Ardea occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--This species occurs in the United States regularly, only in the\r\nsouthern parts of Florida. It is a resident of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThis large white Heron is about the same size as the Great Blue Heron;\r\nit has none of the slender plumes found on the smaller White Herons.\r\nThese birds are not uncommon in southern Florida, especially on the\r\nKeyes, where they build their nests in company with Great Blue Herons.\r\nTheir nesting habits and eggs are very similar to those of the Blue\r\nHeron. Size of eggs 2.25 × 1.80. Data.--Outside of Torch Key, Florida,\r\nJune 16, 1899. Nest a platform of sticks about five feet from the\r\nground, in a mangrove tree. Three eggs. Collector, O. Tollin.\r\n\r\n\r\n194. GREAT BLUE HERON. _Ardea herodias herodias._\r\n\r\nRange.--Nearly the whole of North America, except the extreme north;\r\nresident south of the middle portions of the United States and migratory\r\nnorth of there.\r\n\r\nThis handsome Heron is about four feet in length. Its general color is a\r\nbluish gray, relieved by a black crest, primaries and patches on the\r\nsides, and a white crown. In the south they breed in large colonies,\r\noften in company with many other species. In the northern portions of\r\ntheir range they breed singly or in companies of under a hundred\r\nindividuals. They generally place their rude platforms of sticks well up\r\nin trees, near ponds, swamps or rivers, but in the most northerly parts\r\nof their range, where trees are scarce, they often build on the ground.\r\nUnless they are disturbed, they return to the same breeding grounds,\r\nyear after year. They lay from three to five eggs of a greenish blue\r\ncolor. Size 2.50 × 1.50. Data.--Duck Island, Maine, May 20, 1883. Three\r\neggs. Nest of sticks and twigs, about fifteen feet from the ground.\r\nCollector, R. B. Gray.\r\n\r\n\r\n194a. NORTHWEST COAST HERON. _Ardea herodias fannini._\r\n\r\nThis darker sub-species of the breeding is found along the Pacific\r\ncoast, north to Sitka, Alaska. Its nests and eggs do not differ from the\r\nformer species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 123: Great White Heron. Great Blue Heron.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 122\r\n\r\n194b. WARD'S HERON. _Ardea herodias wardi._\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is a resident in Florida. It is a lighter variety than\r\nthe common. It nests together with the Great Blue Heron and its habits\r\nare the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n195. EUROPEAN HERON. _Ardea cinerea._\r\n\r\nThis species is only an accidental straggler in Greenland. It is very\r\nsimilar to our Blue Heron and is the one which was formerly used to\r\nfurnish sport for the royalty when falconry was at its height.\r\n\r\n\r\n196. EGRET. _Herodias egretta._\r\n\r\nRange.--Resident in the southern portions of the United States,\r\nstraggling northward casually to the northern parts.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the beautiful Herons which have been sought by plume\r\nhunters till they are upon the verge of extermination. They are entirely\r\nwhite, with a long train of beautiful straight \"aigrettes\" flowing from\r\nthe middle of the back. In remote localities, quite large colonies of\r\nthem may still be found, but where they numbered thousands, years ago,\r\nthey can be counted by dozens now. They breed in impenetrable swamps,\r\nvery often in company with the following species, and also with\r\nLouisiana and Little Blue Herons, and White Ibises. Their nests are but\r\nfrail platforms, generally in bushes over the water. Their usual\r\ncomplement of eggs numbers from three to five, four as the most common\r\nnumber. They are generally laid during the latter part of May, but often\r\non account of their being disturbed, nests with eggs may be found in\r\nJuly. The eggs are a light bluish green in color. Size 2.25 × 1.45.\r\nData.--Gainesville, Florida, April 14, 1894. Four eggs on a platform of\r\nsticks and grass, in a button-wood bush over six feet of water.\r\nCollector, George Graham.\r\n\r\n\r\n197. SNOWY EGRET. _Egretta candidissima candidissima._\r\n\r\nRange.--Common now only in restricted localities in the Gulf States and\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is smaller than the last, being but twenty-four\r\ninches in length, is also adorned with \"aigrettes,\" but they are\r\nbeautifully recurved at the tips. Owing to the merciless slaughter to\r\nwhich they have been subjected, their ranks have been woefully\r\ndecimated, and it is to be hoped that the remaining ones may be safely\r\nprotected. Their nesting habits are the same as the last, although, of\r\ncourse, the eggs are smaller. Size 1.80 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 124: Snowy Egret. Egret.]\r\n[Illustration: Light greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 123\r\n\r\n198. REDDISH EGRET. _Dichromanassa rufescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--In the United States, this species is confined chiefly to the\r\nGulf States.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat larger than the last species, the head and neck are\r\nrufous, the body is bluish gray, and the back is adorned with slender\r\ngray plumes. It also has a white phase. This Egret is very abundant\r\nalong the whole Gulf coast, but especially so in Texas. Their nesting\r\nhabits are identical with those of the other small Herons and Egrets.\r\nThe three or four eggs are rather of a more greenish blue than the\r\npreceding. Size 1.90 × 1.45. Data.--Gainesville, Florida, April 14,\r\n1894. Three eggs. Nest of sticks and straw in a button-wood tree, two\r\nfeet above the water. Collector, George Graham.\r\n\r\n\r\n199. LOUISIANA HERON. _Hydranassa tricolor ruficollis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Sub-tropical America, north regularly to the Gulf States and\r\ncasually farther.\r\n\r\nThis Heron is of about the size of the Reddish Egret, but the neck is\r\nlonger, more slender and dark, while the chin, throat and underparts are\r\nwhite. The plumes from the back are short, reaching barely to the end of\r\nthe tail. They nest in large colonies in company with Egrets and Little\r\nBlue Herons, placing their nests in the mangroves, only a few feet above\r\nthe water. Their nests are the same as those of the other species, a\r\nslight platform of sticks, and the three to five eggs are practically\r\nnot distinguishable from those of the Snowy or Little Blue Herons. Size\r\n1.75 × 1.35.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 125: Pale bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Reddish Egret. Louisiana Heron.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 124\r\n\r\n200. LITTLE BLUE HERON. _Florida cærulea._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf coasts, north casually to New England\r\nand Manitoba; west to Kansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nA smaller species than the preceding, length 22 inches, plumage a\r\nuniform slaty blue changing to purplish red on the head and neck. They\r\nalso have a white phase, but always show traces of the slaty blue,\r\nespecially on the primaries. Young birds are always white. They breed in\r\nimmense rookeries during April and May. Their nesting habits and eggs\r\nare very similar to the last species, although the eggs average a trifle\r\nsmaller. Size 1.75 × 1.25. Data.--Avery's Island, Louisiana, April 21,\r\n1896. 5 eggs. Nest a flat and frail platform of twigs in a Mimosa tree\r\ngrowing in floating turf, over deep water in a large swamp. Collector,\r\nE. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n\r\n201. GREEN HERON. _Butorides virescens virescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate and sub-tropical America, breeding north to the\r\nBritish Provinces.\r\n\r\nThis is the smallest of our Herons, and is well known all over the\r\ncountry. Sometimes they breed in numbers in rookeries, in company with\r\nthe larger Herons, but in most sections of the country they will be\r\nfound nesting, one or two pairs together, along the border of some swamp\r\nor stream. They have a greater diversity of building sites, than do any\r\nof the other Herons and frequently nest a long ways from water. Their\r\nnests may be found in alders, birches or even apple trees. It is the\r\nusual Heron type of platform, upon which the three to six eggs are laid.\r\nThey are a pale greenish blue in color, and measure 1.45 × 1.10.\r\nData.--Avery's Island, Louisiana, April 10, 1894. 5 eggs on a platform\r\nof twigs placed in a willow tree growing on the edge of a pond.\r\nCollected by E. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 126: Pale bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Little Blue Heron. Green Heron.]\r\n[Illustration: Light bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 125\r\n\r\n201a. FRAZAR'S GREEN HERON. _Butorides virescens frazari._\r\n\r\nA darker variety found in Lower California; nesting the same as the\r\ncommon species.\r\n\r\n201b. ANTHONY'S GREEN HERON. _Butorides virescens anthonyi._\r\n\r\nA lighter, desert form found in the arid portions of the interior of\r\nsouthwestern United States and Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 127: NEST AND EGGS OF GREEN HERON.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 126\r\n\r\n202. BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT HERON. _Nycticorax nycticorax naevius_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America from southern British Provinces, southward;\r\nwinters along the Gulf coast and beyond.\r\n\r\nA well known bird, often called \"quawk\" from the sound of its note\r\nfrequently heard in the evening. While, in some localities, only a few\r\npairs of these birds are found nesting together, most of them gather\r\ntogether into large colonies during the breeding season. In New England\r\nthey generally select a remote pine grove as their breeding grounds. If\r\nnot disturbed they will return to this same place each year. Their nests\r\nare built of sticks and lined with small twigs, and are placed well up\r\ntowards the tops of the trees.\r\n\r\nFrequently several nests will be found in the same tree, and I have\r\ncounted as many as fifty nests in view at the same time. In large swamps\r\nin the south they generally nest at a low elevation, while in the\r\nmarshes of Wisconsin and Minnesota, large colonies of them nest on the\r\nground, making their nest of rushes. Like all Heronries, those of this\r\nspecies have a nauseating odor, from the remains of decayed fish, etc.,\r\nwhich are strewn around the bases of the trees. Their eggs number from\r\nthree to five and are of a pale bluish green color. Size 2.00 × 1.40.\r\nData.--Uxbridge, Mass., May 30, 1898. 4 eggs. Nest of sticks, about\r\nthirty feet up in a pine tree. Many other nests. Collector, H. A. Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n203. YELLOW-CROWNED NIGHT HERON. _Nyctanassa violacea_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Sub-tropical America, breeding along the Gulf coast and to Lower\r\nCalifornia; casually farther north, to Illinois and South Carolina.\r\n\r\nA handsome grayish colored species, with long lanceolate plumes on the\r\nback, and two or three fine white plumes from the back of the head, like\r\nthose of the Black-crowned species. Its black head, with tawny white\r\ncrown and ear coverts, renders it unmistakable. This species nests in\r\ncolonies or by pairs, like the preceding, and very often in company with\r\nother Herons. They lay from three to six eggs, very similar in size,\r\nshape and color to those of the Black-crowned Heron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 128: Pale bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Black-crowned Night Heron. Yellow-crowned Heron.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 127\r\n\r\nCRANES, RAILS, etc. Order VIII. PALUDICOLÆ\r\n\r\nCRANES. Family GRUIDAE\r\n\r\nCranes are large, long-legged, long-necked birds, somewhat resembling\r\nHerons. Their structure and mode of living partakes more of the nature\r\nof the Rails, however. They are found upon the prairies, where besides\r\nshell fish from the ponds, they feed largely upon grasshoppers, worms,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n204. WHOOPING CRANE. _Grus americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of North America, breeding from about the latitude of\r\nIowa northward to the Arctic regions; winters in the Gulf states and\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThe Whooping Crane is the largest of the family in America, measuring 50\r\ninches or more in length. The plumage of the adults is pure white, with\r\nblack primaries. The bare parts of the head and face are carmine. It is\r\na very locally distributed species, in some sections being practically\r\nunknown, while in a neighboring locality it may be rated as common. They\r\nare very shy birds and are not easily obtained. They nest either upon\r\nthe solid earth or in marshy places over the water. In either case the\r\nnest is a very bulky mass of grass and weeds from two to three feet in\r\ndiameter and raised perhaps a foot above the ground. They lay two eggs\r\nof a brownish buff color, irregularly blotched with brown, and with\r\nfainter marking of gray. Size 3.75 x 2.50. Data.--Torkton, northern\r\nAssiniboia, northwest Canada. Nest a mass of marsh hay, three feet in\r\ndiameter, on the prairie. The birds seen, but very wary. Collector,\r\nCowbry Brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n205. LITTLE BROWN CRANE. _Grus canadensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America in the interior, breeding from Hudson Bay and\r\nsouthern Alaska north to the Arctic coast; south in winter to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis uniform gray colored Crane differs from the next species only in\r\nsize, being about three feet in length, while the Sandhill averages\r\nthree and one-half feet. The eggs cannot be distinguished with any\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 129: Whooping Crane. Little Brown Crane.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 128\r\n\r\n[Illustration 130: Brownish buff. EGG OF WHOOPING CRANE.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff. EGG OF LITTLE BROWN CRANE.]\r\n[Illustration: Left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 129\r\n\r\n206. SANDHILL CRANE. _Grus mexicana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, breeding from the Gulf States, locally\r\nnorth to the southern parts of the British Provinces.\r\n\r\nThis is the most common and the most southerly distributed member of the\r\nfamily. In some sections of Florida and Texas it is regarded as\r\nabundant. They nest in marshy places near secluded ponds. The nests are\r\nmasses of grass, weeds and roots, generally placed in marshes and\r\nentirely surrounded by water. The two eggs are similar to those of the\r\nWhooping Crane, but the ground color is lighter. The eggs of the two\r\nspecies cannot always, with certainty, be distinguished. Size 3.75 x\r\n2.40. Data.--Carman, Manitoba, May 31, 1903. 2 eggs. Nest on a knoll in\r\na marsh, hidden by dead rushes and weeds; a flat loose structure of\r\nbroken rushes and reeds. Collector, Chris Forge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURLANS. Family ARAMIDÆ\r\n\r\n207. LIMPKIN. _Aramus vociferus._\r\n\r\nRange.--This bird is a native of the West Indies and Central America,\r\nbut occurs regularly north to the southern portions of Florida.\r\n\r\nThis strange bird is the only member of its family found in the United\r\nStates. It may be likened to a large Rail or a small Crane, being\r\napparently, a connecting link between the two. It is about two feet in\r\nlength, and the plumage is mottled brownish and white. It lives in the\r\nmarshes, from whence, until late at night, emanate its strange cries,\r\nwhich are likened to those of a child in distress. They nest in the most\r\nimpenetrable parts of swamps, building their nests of rushes, grass and\r\nweeds, in tangled masses of vines a few feet above the ground or water.\r\nThey lay from three to eight eggs having a ground color of buff or\r\ngrayish white and blotched with light brown. Their coloration is very\r\nsimilar to those of the Cranes. Size 2.30 x 1.70. They nest in April and\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 131: Sandhill Crane.

Family RALLIDÆ\r\n\r\nMembers of this family are almost exclusively frequenters of marshes,\r\nwhere they lead a shy, retiring life and are more often heard than seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n208. KING RAIL. _Rallus elegans._\r\n\r\nRange.--Fresh water marshes of eastern United States from New England\r\nand the Dakotas, southward. Very abundant on the South Atlantic coast,\r\nin the inland marshes.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the largest of the Rails, (17 inches in length) and may\r\nbe known by the richness of its plumage, the breast and wing coverts\r\nbeing a rich cinnamon color. It is almost exclusively a fresh water\r\nspecies and is very rarely found around a salt water marsh. Its nest is\r\nbuilt on the ground, in a tuft of grass and weeds woven about the\r\nupright stalks. They lay from five to twelve eggs having a cream colored\r\nground, sparingly speckled with brown and lilac. Size 1.60 × 1.20.\r\nData.--Clark County, Missouri, June 6, 1893. 10 eggs. Nest composed of\r\nreed stalks; a slightly concave mass 8 inches across, and only two\r\ninches above the water, in a clump of reeds. Collector, Ed. S. Currier.\r\n\r\n\r\n209. BELDING'S RAIL. _Rallus beldingi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California and the islands in the Gulf.\r\n\r\nThis is a locally confined species, very similar to the preceding but\r\ndarker and with the flank bars narrower. Its nesting or eggs will not\r\ndiffer from those of the King Rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n210. CALIFORNIA CLAPPER RAIL. _Rallus obsoletus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Salt marshes of the Pacific coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is like a dull colored King Rail, with reference to the\r\nmarkings of the back, or a bright colored Clapper Rail, as it has a\r\ncinnamon colored breast. It is an abundant species in nearly all the\r\nsalt marshes along the coast. They make their nests on the higher parts\r\nof the marsh, where it is comparatively dry, building them of grass and\r\nstrips of rushes. They lay from four to nine eggs of a light buff color,\r\nboldly spotted with brown, and with fainter markings of lilac. Size 1.75\r\n× 1.25. Data.--Palo Alto, Cal., May 1, 1899. Nest of marsh grass under a\r\nsmall bush on bank of slough. Collector, Ernest Adams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 133: Cream color.]\r\n[Illustration: Light buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 132\r\n\r\n211. CLAPPER RAIL. _Rallus crepitans crepitans._\r\n\r\nRange.--Salt marshes of the Atlantic coast from southern New England\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nA grayish colored Rail, about the size of, and with the markings similar\r\nto those of the King Rail. It is as exclusively a salt water species as\r\nthe King Rail is a fresh water one. With the possible exception of the\r\nCarolina or Sora Rail, this is the most abundant of all the Rails,\r\nhundreds nesting in a single marsh on the South Atlantic coast. Their\r\nnests are built of rushes and weeds, and are placed on the ground either\r\nin the tall grass bordering the marshes or attached to the rushes in the\r\nmidst of the marsh. The nesting season commences during April and\r\ncontinues through May. They lay from six to fourteen eggs, of a buff\r\ncolor spotted irregularly with brown and gray. Size 1.70 × 1.20.\r\n\r\n\r\n211a. LOUISIANA CLAPPER RAIL. _Rallus crepitans saturatus._\r\n\r\nThe habitation of this subspecies is limited to the coast of Louisiana.\r\nIt is very similar to the proceeding but is said to be brighter in\r\nplumage.\r\n\r\n\r\n211b. FLORIDA CLAPPER RAIL. _Rallus crepitans scotti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western coast of Florida.\r\n\r\nThis bird is also similar to crepitans but is much darker and brighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n211c. WAYNE'S CLAPPER RAIL. _Rallus crepitans waynei_.\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Florida.\r\n\r\nThis subspecies is a little darker than crepitans, being about midway\r\nbetween that species and Rallus scotti. The nests and eggs of any of\r\nthese sub-species cannot be distinguished from those of the common\r\nClapper Rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n211.2. CARIBBEAN CLAPPER RAIL. _Rallus longirostris caribaeus._\r\n\r\nRange.--West Indies and east coast of Mexico, north to southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the Clapper, but has a shorter and relatively\r\nstouter bill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 134: King Rail. Clapper Rail.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 133\r\n\r\n212. VIRGINIA RAIL. _Rallus virginianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, breeding from the Middle States and\r\nCalifornia, northward to British Columbia and Labrador, and wintering\r\nalong the Gulf coast; most abundant in the east.\r\n\r\nA small Rail, 9 inches long, very similar in markings and coloration to\r\nthe King Rail. It is found chiefly in fresh water swamps, where it\r\nbuilds its nests in tufts of rushes. The eggs number from six to\r\nfourteen, and are creamy white, or white, speckled with reddish brown.\r\nSize 1.25 × .90 Data.--Fighting Island, Detroit River, Michigan, May 30,\r\n1904. Nest made of marsh grass, in rushes, 6 inches above the water.\r\nCollector, E. Leroy King.\r\n\r\n\r\n213. SPOTTED CRAKE. _Porzana porzana._\r\n\r\nThis common European species is casually found in Greenland. It breeds\r\nin large numbers throughout temperate Europe, nesting as do the American\r\nRails.\r\n\r\n\r\n214. SORA. _Porzana carolina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, breeding from the southern parts of the\r\nBritish possessions, south to the Gulf coast.\r\n\r\nThis abundant species of Rail may be readily known by its small size,\r\nabout eight inches long, and the black face and throat of the adult.\r\nThese are the \"Rail-birds\" or \"Ortolans\" which are annually slaughtered\r\nby thousands, for sport and marketing, during their fall migration. It\r\nis only because of the large families that they rear, that they are able\r\nto withstand this yearly decimation of their ranks. They nest either in\r\nsalt or fresh water marshes, making a rude structure of grass, weeds and\r\nstrips of rushes, on the ground, generally concealed in a tuft of grass\r\nin a tangled swamp or marsh. During May, they lay from six to sixteen\r\neggs of a bright, buffy gray color, spotted with reddish brown and\r\nlavender. Size 1.25 × .90.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 135: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Sora. Virginia Rail.]\r\n[Illustration: Bright buff.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 134\r\n\r\n215. Yellow Rail. _Coturnicops noveboracensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Locally distributed in temperate North America, from New England\r\nand Nova Scotia, to California and British Columbia; south to the Gulf\r\nStates in winter.\r\n\r\nThis is a very handsome species, with plumage of glossy brown, yellowish\r\nbuff, black and white; length seven inches. They are very shy and\r\nsecretive, and are probably more common than generally supposed. Their\r\nnesting habits are the same as those of the preceding. Their eggs are of\r\na rich buff color, speckled in the form of a wreath about the large end,\r\nwith reddish brown. They are relatively narrower than those of other\r\nRails. Size 1.10 × .80. Data.--Benson Co., North Dakota, June 4, 1901.\r\nSet of ten eggs collected by Rev. P. B. Peabody. This set is in the\r\ncollection of Mr. John Lewis Childs.\r\n\r\n\r\n216. BLACK RAIL. _Creciscus jamaicensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, breeding from northern United States\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nSmallest of the rails; 5 inches in length. A dark slaty colored bird\r\nwith white specks, and a patch of dark chestnut on the fore back. This\r\ndiminutive species is very hard to find because of its retiring habits,\r\nbut according to Mr. Brewster it may be located by the clicking sound of\r\nits song.\r\n\r\nTheir nests are woven of strips of rushes or grasses, and are well\r\n\"cupped\" to receive the eggs. They are on the ground on the border of,\r\nor in, marshy places. Mr. Childs has a fine set of eight eggs, taken by\r\nArthur T. Wayne, at Mt. Pleasant, S. C., June 10, 1903. The nest was\r\nlocated in an oat field. The eggs have a creamy white ground, and are\r\nspecked all over with reddish brown. Size 1.03 × .75.\r\n\r\n\r\n216.1. FARALLON RAIL. _Creciscus coturniculus._\r\n\r\nKnown only from a single specimen, which is slightly smaller than\r\n_jamaicensis_ and without the white specks on the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 136: Rich buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Yellow Rail. Black Rail.]\r\n[Illustration]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 135\r\n\r\n217. Corn Crake. _Crex crex._\r\n\r\nThis European Rail is casually found in Greenland and along the Atlantic\r\ncoast of North America. It is the most abundant of European Rails and is\r\nfound breeding in marshes, meadows and along streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n218. PURPLE GALLINULE. _Ionornis martinicus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States; casually north in eastern United\r\nStates to Massachusetts and Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very handsome bird with purplish head, neck and under parts, and a\r\ngreenish back. Like all the Gallinules and Coots, this species has a\r\nscaly crown plate. An abundant breeding species in the southern parts of\r\nits range. Its nests are made of rushes or grasses woven together and\r\neither attached to living rushes or placed in tufts of grass. They lay\r\nfrom six to ten eggs of a creamy or pale buff color sparingly blotched\r\nwith chestnut. Size 1.60 × 1.15. Data.--Avery's Island, Louisiana, May\r\n7, 1896. Ten eggs. Nest of dry rushes, woven to standing ones growing\r\naround an \"alligator hole\" in a marsh. Collector, E. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 137: Purple Gallinule. Corn Crake.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale buff.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 136\r\n\r\n219. FLORIDA GALLINULE. _Gallinula galeata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, from New England, Manitoba and\r\nCalifornia, southward.\r\n\r\nA grayish colored bird of similar size to the last (13 inches long),\r\nwith flanks streaked with white, and with the bill and crown plate\r\nreddish. They nest in colonies in marshes and swamps, building their\r\nnests like those of the Purple Gallinule. The eggs, too, are similar,\r\nbut larger and slightly duller. Size 1.75 × 1.20.\r\n\r\nData.--Montezuma marshes, Florida, June 6, 1894. Eleven eggs. Nest of\r\ndead flaggs, floating in two feet of water. Collector, Robert Warwick.\r\n\r\n\r\n220. EUROPEAN COOT. _Fulica atra._\r\n\r\nA European species very similar to the next, and only casually found in\r\nGreenland. Nesting the same as our species.\r\n\r\n\r\n221. COOT. _Fulica americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of temperate North America, from the southern parts of the\r\nBritish Provinces, southward; very common in suitable localities\r\nthroughout its range.\r\n\r\nThe Coot bears some resemblance to the Florida Gallinule, but is\r\nsomewhat larger, its bill is white with a blackish band about the\r\nmiddle, and each toe has a scalloped web. They inhabit the same marshes\r\nand sloughs that are used by the Rails and Gallinules as nesting places,\r\nand they have the same retiring habits, skulking through the grass to\r\navoid observation, rather than flying. Their nests are either floating\r\npiles of decayed vegetation, or are built of dead rushes in clumps of\r\nrushes on the banks. They generally build in large colonies. The eggs\r\nnumber from six to sixteen and have a grayish ground color, finely\r\nspecked all over the surface with blackish. Size 1.80 × 1.30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 138: Pale buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Florida Gallinule.

Family PHALAROPODIDAE\r\n\r\nPhalaropes are small Plover-like birds, but with lobate webbed feet,\r\nsimilar to those of the Grebes and Coots.\r\n\r\n\r\n222. RED PHALAROPE. _Phalaropus fulicarius._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the far north, and migrating to\r\nthe middle portions of the United States, chiefly on the coasts.\r\n\r\nThe Red Phalarope during the breeding season has the underparts wholly\r\nreddish brown; they are very rarely seen in the United States in this\r\ndress, however for it is early changed for a suit of plain gray and\r\nwhite. This species has a much stouter bill than the two following; it\r\nis about nine inches in length. All the Phalaropes are good swimmers,\r\nand this species, especially, is often found in large flocks off the\r\ncoast, floating on the surface of the water; they feed largely upon\r\nsmall marine insects. Nests in hollows on the ground, lined with a few\r\ngrasses. The eggs are three or four in number, generally of a greenish\r\nbuff color, spotted and blotched with brown and blackish.\r\nData.--Myvates, Iceland, June 19, 1897. Collector, C. Jefferys.\r\n\r\n\r\n223. NORTHERN PHALAROPE. _Lobipes labatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the northern parts of the\r\nBritish Provinces.\r\n\r\nThis is the smallest of the Phalaropes, being about eight inches long;\r\nin summer it has a chestnut band across the breast and on the side of\r\nthe neck. Its habits and nesting habits vary but little from those of\r\nthe Red Phalarope, although its distribution is a little more southerly,\r\nand it is not as exclusively maritime as the preceding species. It is\r\nfound on both coasts of the United States, but more common on the\r\nPacific side, during the fall and spring, when going to or returning\r\nfrom its winter quarters in the tropics. Their eggs cannot, with\r\ncertainty, be distinguished from the preceding species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 139: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Red Phalarope.

WILSON'S PHALAROPE. _Steganopus tricolor._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of temperate North America, breeding from the latitude\r\nof Iowa, northward, and wintering south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is the most handsome species of the family, being of a very\r\ngraceful form, of a grayish and white color, with a broad stripe through\r\nthe eye and down the neck, where it fades insensibly into a rich\r\nchestnut color. It is an exclusively American species and is rarely\r\nfound near the coast. It builds its nest generally in a tuft of grass,\r\nthe nests also being of grass. The eggs are of a brownish or greenish\r\nbuff color, spotted and blotched with black and brown. Size 1.30 × .90.\r\nData.--Larimore, N. D., May 30, 1897. Nest a shallow depression,\r\nscratched in the sand, under a tuft of grass on an island. Collector, T.\r\nF. Eastgate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 140: Male, female, young.

AVOCET. _Recurvirostra americana_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, breeding north to Northwest Territory.\r\n\r\nThe Avocet can be known from any other bird by its up-curved bill, light\r\nplumage, webbed feet and large size (length about 17 inches). These\r\nwaders are quite numerous in suitable localities throughout the west,\r\nconstructing their nests in the grass, bordering marshy places. The nest\r\nis simply a lining of grass in a hollow in the ground. They lay three or\r\nfour eggs of a dark greenish or brownish buff color, boldly marked with\r\nbrown and black. Size 1.90 × 1.30. Data.--Rush Lake, Assiniboia. Four\r\neggs laid in a depression in the sand, lined with dry weeds. Many birds\r\nnesting in the colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n226. BLACK-NECKED STILT. _Himantopus mexicanus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Like the last, this species is rarely found east of the\r\nMississippi, but is very abundant in the United States west of that\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nA black and white wader, with extremely long red legs; otherwise a\r\ngracefully formed bird. It breeds in large colonies anywhere in its\r\nrange, making its nests of weeds and sometimes a few twigs, on the\r\nground beside of, or in the marshes. Their eggs number three or four and\r\nare brownish or greenish buff with numerous markings of brownish black,\r\nthese markings being somewhat lengthened and mostly running lengthwise\r\nof the shell. They nest during April in the southern parts of their\r\nrange and through May and June in the northern. Size of eggs 1.80 ×\r\n1.25. Data.--Freshwater Lake, southern California, June 5, 1891. Four\r\neggs laid on a mud flat near the water's edge; no nest. Collector, Evan\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 141: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: American Avocet.

They feed upon small shell fish, or insects which they get\r\nusually by probing in the soft mud.\r\n\r\n227. EUROPEAN WOODCOCK. _Scolopax rusticola_.\r\n\r\nThis European bird is similar to the American Woodcock, but is larger\r\nand is barred beneath. Their habits are the same as those of our\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n228. WOODCOCK. _Philohela minor_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, north to the British Provinces, breeding\r\nthroughout its range.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most eagerly sought game birds of the east. Their\r\nflight is very rapid and erratic, and accompanied by a peculiar\r\nwhistling sound made by the rapid motion of the wings; it requires a\r\nskillful marksman to bring them down. They frequent boggy places\r\nespecially \"runs\" lined with alders, where they bore in the soft ground\r\nfor worms and grubs. Their eggs are laid upon the bare ground among the\r\nleaves and sticks; they are of about the color of dead leaves, as is\r\nalso the bird, making it quite difficult to discover their nests. They\r\nlay three or four eggs of a buffy color, with yellowish brown spots.\r\nSize 1.50 × 1.15.\r\n\r\n\r\n229. EUROPEAN SNIPE. _Gallinago gallinago_.\r\n\r\nA common species in Europe; of casual or accidental appearance in\r\nGreenland. The bird does not differ essentially from our Snipe and its\r\nhabits are the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 142: Buffy gray.]\r\n[Illustration: American Woodcock.

Of about the same size as the Woodcock (11 inches long).\r\nThis species, to a great extent frequents the same haunts used by\r\nWoodcock, but is especially fond of open marshy meadows, with winding\r\nbrooks. Their nests are depressions in grassy banks, generally unlined;\r\nthe three or four eggs have an olive gray color and are strongly marked\r\nwith blackish brown. Size 1.50 × 1.10. Data.--Lake Winnipegosis,\r\nManitoba, June 10, 1903. Nest in a hollow on a tuft of marsh grass, the\r\nfour eggs having their points together. Collector, Walter Raine.\r\n\r\n\r\n230.1. GREATER SNIPE. _Gallinago media_.\r\n\r\nA European species, only American as having accidentally occurred at\r\nHudson Bay; similar in appearance to the preceding species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 145: Olive gray.]\r\n[Illustration: NEST AND EGGS OF WOODCOCK.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 144\r\n\r\n231. DOWITCHER. _Macrorhamphus griseus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, most abundant in the eastern parts; breeds in the\r\nextreme north, and winters from the Gulf States to Northern South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThis species is commonly known as \"Red-breasted Snipe\" in late spring\r\nand summer because of the rich, rusty red coloration of the underparts,\r\nand as \"Gray-back\" in winter because of its color at that season. They\r\nare very common along the Atlantic coast during the Spring migration;\r\nthey can be easily identified by their very long bills, which are over\r\ntwo inches in length and nearly one quarter the length of the whole\r\nbird. They nest during June, placing their three or four eggs in a\r\nslight hollow, which may or may not be lined with dried grass or leaves.\r\nThe eggs have a greenish or brownish buff color and are boldly marked\r\nwith dark brown. They do not differ greatly from those of the Snipe.\r\nData.--Mackenzie River, June 27, 1900. Four eggs in a hollow in the\r\ngrass, lined with dead grass. Collector, Walter Raine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 146: Dowitcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: LOON.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 145\r\n\r\n232. LONG-BILLED DOWITCHER. _Macrorhamphus griseus scolopaceus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, but not common on the Atlantic coast;\r\nbreeds in the Arctic regions and migrates chiefly through the central\r\nand western parts of the United States to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis bird is practically the same as the last, but is a trifle larger\r\nand the bill averages about a half inch longer. They are very numerous\r\nin their breeding haunts, and, during their migrations, fly in large\r\ncompact flocks. They are not very timid, and consequently fall an easy\r\nprey to the gunners. Their nesting habits and eggs are the same as the\r\nlast species, except that the eggs may average a trifle larger. Size\r\n1.75 × 1.15. Data.--Norton Is., Alaska, June, 1900. Nest a small hollow\r\nin the dry ground. Four eggs. Collector, Capt. H. H. Bodfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n233. STILT SANDPIPER. _Micropalama himantopus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Rocky Mountains; breeds in the Arctic\r\nregions and winters from the Gulf States southward.\r\n\r\nIn the summer, these birds may be known by the reddish coloration of the\r\nunderparts, which are numerously barred; they are smaller than the\r\npreceding, length about eight inches. Their nesting habits are the same\r\nas those of the majority of the members of the family. The three or four\r\neggs are buffy or grayish, and are blotched and spotted with shades of\r\nbrown. Size 1.40 × 1.00.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 147: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Long-billed.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 146\r\n\r\n234. KNOT. _Tringa canutus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions in summer; south through the United States,\r\nchiefly on the Atlantic coast, to South America.\r\n\r\nOf about the same size as the Dowitchers, length 10.5 inches, but with a\r\nmuch shorter bill. In summer the entire under parts are a uniform\r\nreddish chestnut color. They are known to breed in Arctic America, from\r\nPoint Barrow and Hudson Bay, northward, but no authentic eggs are known,\r\nat present, to exist in collections. One taken from a bird by Lieut.\r\nGreely, was a pea green color, specked with brown; size 1.10 × 1.00. As\r\nit was not fully developed, it was probably correct neither as to size\r\nnor color.\r\n\r\n\r\n235. PURPLE SANDPIPER. _Arquatella maritima maritima_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions, wintering south to the Middle States and the\r\nGreat Lakes, but chiefly on the coast.\r\n\r\nA grayish and blackish colored species, about nine inches long. It nests\r\nin northern Labrador, about Hudson Bay and in Iceland. Its eggs are a\r\ngrayish buff color handsomely splashed with rich shades of brown and\r\nobscure markings of darker gray. Data.--Northern Iceland, June 7, 1897.\r\nFour eggs. Nest a hollow in the ground among grass and weeds and lined\r\nwith a few grasses. Collector, C. Jefferys.\r\n\r\n\r\n235a. ALEUTIAN SANDPIPER. _Arguatella maritima couesi_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Supposed to be a resident on the coast and islands of Alaska,\r\nfrom the Aleutians northward.\r\n\r\nA very similar species to the preceding; scarcely distinguishable. These\r\nSandpipers, which are found in Alaska at all seasons of the year, breed\r\nduring May and June. Their nesting habits are the same as those of the\r\npreceding bird and the eggs are indistinguishable. Size 1.40 × 1.00.\r\nData.--Unalaska, Bering Sea, June 3, 1898. Nest containing four eggs, a\r\ndepression in the moss, lined with grasses and bits of moss. The eggs\r\nwere laid with their small ends together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 148: Knot. Purple Sandpiper.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 147\r\n\r\n237. PRIBILOF SANDPIPER. _Arquatella maritina ptilocnemis_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast and islands of Bering Sea, south in winter to southern\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nThis bird, which is ten inches in length, has the feathers of the upper\r\nparts edged with rusty, and the underparts light, with a distinguishing\r\npatch of black on the breast. Similar in appearance to the Red-backed\r\nSandpiper, but not so reddish above, and the latter has the black patch\r\non the belly. They breed commonly on the Pribilof and other islands in\r\nBering Sea, nesting the same as other Sandpipers. Their four eggs are\r\nsimilar to those of the preceding, but average darker. Size 1.50 × 1.05.\r\n\r\n\r\n238. SHARP-TAILED SANDPIPER. _Pisobia aurita_.\r\n\r\nRange.--An Asiatic species, quite abundant in Alaska in the summer;\r\nsupposed to migrate south in winter, wholly on the Asiatic side of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nA similar bird, in appearance, to the following, but slightly smaller\r\nand with the breast more ruddy. Its nesting habits probably do not\r\ndiffer from those of the following Sandpiper.\r\n\r\n\r\n239. PECTORAL SANDPIPER. _Pisobia maculata_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding in the Arctic regions, and\r\nwintering south of the United States, most abundant in the eastern parts\r\nof the United States during migrations.\r\n\r\nThis species is blackish brown above, with light brown edgings to the\r\nfeathers, and white below, except the chest, which is brownish, streaked\r\nwith black. A very peculiar species, having the power, during the mating\r\nseason, of inflating the throat to a great extent, making a balloon-like\r\nappendage, nearly the size of the bird. They have more the habits of\r\nSnipe, than do most of the Sandpipers, frequenting grassy meadows or\r\nmarshes, in preference to the seashore. Their nests are grass lined\r\ndepressions, and the eggs are grayish or greenish buff, blotched with\r\nbrown. Size 1.45 × 1.00. Data.--Cape Smythe, Alaska, June 1900. Four\r\neggs in a hollow in the ground, lined with grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 149: Sharp-tailed Sandpiper. Pectoral Sandpiper.]\r\n[Illustration: egg, no caption.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 148\r\n\r\n240. WHITE-RUMPED SANDPIPER. _Pisobia fuscicollis_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from Labrador and southern Greenland,\r\nnorthward and wintering from central to Southern South America; most\r\ncommon on the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThis species is 7.5 inches in length, and has white upper tail coverts;\r\notherwise it is marked similarly to the preceding Sandpiper. Its nesting\r\nhabits are the same as those of the majority of the family, and the\r\nthree or four eggs that they lay cannot be distinguished from those of\r\nthe following species. Size 1.30 × .90. These are one of the most common\r\nof the beach birds along the Atlantic coast during migrations; they are\r\nvery often known as Bonaparte Sandpipers.\r\n\r\n\r\n241. BAIRD'S SANDPIPER. _Pisobia bairdi_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, chiefly in the interior, breeding along the\r\nArctic coast and about Hudson Bay, and wintering south of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA very similar species to the preceding, but without the white rump.\r\nTheir nests are hollows in the ground, generally concealed in a tuft of\r\ngrass, and lined with grasses and a few leaves. They lay three or four\r\neggs having a grayish colored ground, and marked with different shades\r\nof brown, and also with some faint markings of lilac. Size 1.30 × .90.\r\nData.--Peel River, Arctic America, June 18, 1898. Four eggs, taken with\r\nthe bird by an Indian. Eggs in a slight hollow on the river bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n242. LEAST SANDPIPER. _Pisobia minutilla_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from the southern parts of the British\r\nProvinces northward; winters from southern United States southward.\r\nCommon in the interior and on both coasts.\r\n\r\nThis is the smallest of our Sandpipers, being under six inches in\r\nlength. Except for size, they are similar in appearance to Baird's\r\nSandpiper, only the back is browner. A very abundant species during\r\nmigrations, being found on the seashore or in marshes, nearly always in\r\ncompany with other species of the family. Their nests are the same as\r\nother Sandpipers, and the eggs are grayish, thickly specked with brown.\r\nSize 1.15 × .80. Data.--Peel River, Arctic America, June 20, 1899. Nest\r\nsimply a depression in the river bank, lined with grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 150: White-rumped Sandpiper. Baird's Sandpiper. Least\r\nSandpiper.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 149\r\n\r\n242.1. LONG-TOED STINT. _Pisobia damacensis_.\r\n\r\nAn Asiatic species accidentally found on the Alaskan shores. It is a\r\nvery similar bird to the Least Sandpiper, and about the same size. As\r\nimplied by its name, it has unusually long toes.\r\n\r\n\r\n243. DUNLIN. _Pelidna alpina alpina_.\r\n\r\nA very common Sandpiper in the British Isles and in Europe, but only\r\ncasually occurring as a straggler along the Atlantic coast. Very similar\r\nto the next species, but a trifle smaller. The nest and eggs do not\r\ndiffer from the following.\r\n\r\n\r\n243a. RED-BACKED SANDPIPER. _Pelidna alpina sakhalina_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding from southern Greenland,\r\nLabrador, Hudson Bay and the Yukon, northward, wintering from the Gulf\r\nStates southward. This handsome species is similar to the Pribilof\r\nSandpiper, but is smaller (length 8 inches), the upperparts are more\r\nreddish, the breast more heavily streaked, and it has a black patch on\r\nthe belly instead of on the breast as in ptilocnemis. Their nesting\r\nhabits are similar to others of the family; they lay three or four eggs\r\nwith a brownish or greenish buff color, heavily blotched and spotted\r\nwith shades of brown and chestnut. Size 1.40 × 1.00. Data.--- Peel\r\nRiver, Arctic America, June 30, 1899. Nest a simple cavity in the\r\nground, lined with a few grasses and three or four leaves. Collector, J.\r\nO. Stringer.\r\n\r\n\r\n244. CURLEW SANDPIPER. _Erolia ferruginea_.\r\n\r\nRange.--A common Old World species, but regarded as rare in eastern\r\nNorth America and northern Alaska.\r\n\r\nA bird of slighter build, but similar coloration to the Knot; smaller\r\n(length eight inches) and with a slightly decurved bill. Until within\r\nrecent years, eggs of these birds were rarely seen in collections, and I\r\nbelieve they have not yet been taken in this country, although a few\r\npairs nest along our Arctic coast. Their eggs are very similar to those\r\nof the Red-backed Sandpiper, but average somewhat larger. Size 1.50 ×\r\n1.05. Data.--Kola, northern Lapland, June 15, 1898. Four eggs laid in a\r\ngrass-lined hollow in the ground. Collector, J. Ramberg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 151: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Red-backed Sandpiper. Curlew Sandpiper.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 150\r\n\r\n245. SPOONBILL SANDPIPER. _Eurynorhynchus pygmeus_.\r\n\r\nA very rare Asiatic species, which has been taken in Kotzebue Sound,\r\nAlaska. A very peculiar bird having the end of the bill broadened and\r\nflattened into a sort of spatula. Otherwise very similar to the Least\r\nSandpiper, but with the breast and sides of neck ruddy in summer. About\r\n75 specimens of this rare bird are known to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n246. SEMIPALMATED SANDPIPER. _Ereunetes pusillus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, but chiefly in the eastern and central\r\nparts, breeding about the ponds and streams of Labrador and Hudson Bay,\r\nand northward. These little Sandpipers are abundant during the\r\nmigrations either in marshes or on beaches. They are most often found in\r\ncompany with other species, such as the Spotted and Least Sandpipers.\r\nTheir appearance is very similar to that of the Least Sandpipers, but\r\nthey are slightly larger and the feet are partially webbed. Their eggs\r\nhave a greenish buff or grayish ground color and are spotted with\r\nbrownish or blackish, sometimes, so heavily as to completely obscure the\r\nshell color. Size 1.20 × .80. Data.--Small island near Okak, Labrador,\r\nJuly 3, 1895. 2 eggs. Nest a hollow at the foot of a tuft of grass,\r\nlined with a few bits of grass and small leaves. Eggs unmistakable in\r\nthis dark type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 152: Spoonbill Sandpiper. Semipalmated Sandpiper.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 151\r\n\r\n247. WESTERN SANDPIPER. _Ereunetes mauri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and\r\nmigrating through the United States, chiefly west of the Mississippi to\r\nthe Gulf States and southward.\r\n\r\nScarcely to be distinguished from the preceding species, but the upper\r\nparts are said to be brighter and the bill, to average a trifle longer.\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs are precisely the same as those of the\r\nSemipalmated variety. Data.--Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska, June 28,\r\n1898. Four eggs. Nest a neatly rounded hollow, sunk into a mossy hummock\r\nin marshy ground. Collector, Joseph Grinnell.\r\n\r\n\r\n248. SANDERLING. _Calidris leucophaea._\r\n\r\nRange.--Found in all parts of the northern hemisphere, breeding within\r\nthe Arctic Circle and wintering in North America, from California and\r\nSouth Carolina southward.\r\n\r\nA handsome and abundant species, found during migrations by thousands on\r\nbeaches and about large bodies of water in the interior. They are one of\r\nthe lightest colored of the Sandpipers, either in winter or summer\r\nplumage. In summer the upper parts are a light rusty color and black,\r\nand the whole underparts are white. Owing to their extreme northerly\r\ndistribution in summer, but few of their eggs have been taken. Their\r\nnesting habits are like those of the other Sandpipers. The three or four\r\neggs are greenish buff in color, spotted and blotched with brown. Size\r\n1.45 × .95. Data.--Peel River, Alaska, June 18, 1897. Three eggs in a\r\ndepression on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n249. MARBLED GODWIT. _Limosa fedoa._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding, chiefly in the interior, from northern\r\nUnited States northward.\r\n\r\nGodwits are large Plovers with long slightly up-curved bills. This\r\nspecies is 19 inches in length, is of a nearly uniform ruddy color and\r\nis handsomely marbled above, and barred below with black. Their eggs are\r\nlaid upon the ground in the vicinity of ponds or rivers; sometimes there\r\nis no lining and again a few straws or grasses may be twisted around the\r\ndepression. Their eggs number three or four and have a ground color of\r\ngrayish or greenish buff, sometimes quite dark, and are blotched with\r\ndark brown. Size 2.25 × 1.60. Data.--Devil's Lake, N. D., June 10, 1895.\r\nFour eggs laid on the ground in the middle of an unused road. Lined with\r\na few grasses. Collector, W. F. Hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 153: Grayish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Western Sandpiper. Sanderling. Marbled Godwit.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 152\r\n\r\n250. PACIFIC GODWIT. _Limosa lapponica baueri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coasts and islands of the Pacific Ocean on the Asiatic side,\r\nnorth in summer to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis species is more uniform and brighter ruddy beneath than the\r\npreceding, and the back is not marbled as strongly. Even in Alaska where\r\nit breeds, it is not a common species, and it only occurs elsewhere on\r\nthe Pacific coast of America casually. The nesting habits are the same,\r\nbut the eggs are somewhat darker than those of the preceding, but not as\r\ndark as those of the following species. Size 2.20 × 1.45.\r\n\r\n\r\n251. HUDSONIAN GODWIT. _Limosa haemastica._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Rocky Mountains, breeding in the\r\nArctic regions and wintering south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is apparently not as common or is more locally distributed\r\nduring migrations than is the Marbled Godwit. They are more abundant in\r\ntheir breeding grounds and are occasionally seen in large flocks. They\r\nare smaller than the Marbled Godwit (length 18 inches) and are deep\r\nreddish brown below. They lay four eggs on the ground, in marshes or\r\nnear ponds or streams, lining the hollow with weeds and dried leaves.\r\nThe eggs have a dark brownish buff ground color and are blotched with\r\nbrownish black. Size 2.20 × 1.40. Data.--Mackenzie River, Arctic\r\nAmerica. Four eggs laid in a hollow in the ground. Collector, J. O.\r\nStringer.\r\n\r\n\r\n252. BLACK-TAILED GODWIT. _Limosa limosa._\r\n\r\nA European and Asiatic species only casually occurring in Greenland.\r\nVery similar in appearance to our Hudsonian Godwit, which is frequently\r\ncalled by the name of this species. The nesting habits and the eggs are\r\nprecisely like those of the American bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n253. GREEN SHANK. _Glottis nebularia._\r\n\r\nA common bird in Europe and the British Isles, but only American as\r\nhaving been taken once in Florida. A very similar species to the\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 154: Pacific Godwit. Hudsonian Godwit.]\r\n[Illustration: Brownish.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 153\r\n\r\n254. GREATER YELLOW-LEGS. _Totanus melanoleucus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, nesting in the British Provinces and\r\nrarely in the northern part of the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThis and the next species are much sought by sportsmen during their\r\nmigrations; they are commonly called \"Tell-tale,\" the present species\r\nbeing the \"Greater Tell-tale.\" They are blackish above, speckled with\r\nwhite, and below are white and, in summer, marked with arrowhead spots\r\nof black. The legs, as implied by the name of the bird, are yellow and\r\nlong; length of bird, 14 inches. They nest most abundantly in localities\r\nremote from habitations, in the interior of Canada. The eggs are\r\ngenerally laid on the ground, near a marsh or on the bank of a stream,\r\nwith little or no lining to the nest. They are grayish white, boldly\r\nsplashed with several shades of brown, and with lilac. Size 1.65 × 1.25.\r\nData.--Whale River, Labrador, June 10, 1902. Eggs laid on the ground in\r\nan open marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n255. YELLOW-LEGS. _Totanus flavipes._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding chiefly in the interior and eastern\r\nparts of Canada, and rarely in the upper Mississippi Valley. This\r\nspecies is very similar to the preceding, but is smaller; length 10.5\r\ninches. It is also called the \"Lesser Tell-tale,\" a name applied because\r\nof their wariness, and because, when they fly, they warn all other\r\nspecies within hearing, of danger. Their eggs are laid on the ground,\r\nand in similar localities to the preceding. They are three or four in\r\nnumber, grayish or buffy in color, and are quite heavily blotched and\r\nspotted with rich brown and grayish or lilac. Size 1.60 × 1.20.\r\nData.--Whale River, Labrador, June 14, 1902. Four eggs laid on the\r\nground in a large marsh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 155: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Greater Yellow-legs.

SOLITARY SANDPIPER. _Helodromas solitarius solitarius._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding chiefly north of the United\r\nStates boundary, but apt to be found nesting in any part of its range;\r\nwinters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nA bird with a greenish gray back, barred with white, and white below;\r\nlength 8.5 inches. This species is one of the oddities among the waders.\r\nThey are most always met with, singly or in pairs, and are very rarely\r\nseen, even in very small flocks. Their preference is for small ponds or\r\nstreams in wet woods or open meadows, rather than marshes which are\r\nfrequented by other species. They are occasionally seen during the\r\nnesting season, even in the southern parts of their range, and they\r\nprobably breed there although their eggs are very rarely found. The eggs\r\nare clay-colored, spotted with brownish black. Data.--Simco Island,\r\nKingston, Ontario, June 10, 1898. 5 eggs in a shallow depression on the\r\nground, lined with a few grasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 156: Solitary Sandpiper.]\r\n[Illustration: Clay-colored.]\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF SPOTTED SANDPIPER.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 155\r\n\r\n256a. WESTERN SOLITARY SANDPIPER. _Helodromas solitarius cinnamomeus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, west of the Plains; breeds in British Columbia\r\nand probably south of there, also.\r\n\r\nThis bird is like the last, except that the spots on the back are buffy\r\ninstead of white. Its nest and eggs will not differ in any respect from\r\nthose of the eastern form.\r\n\r\n\r\n257. GREEN SANDPIPER. _Helodromas acrophus._\r\n\r\nThis species, which very closely resembles our Solitary Sandpiper, is\r\ncommon in the northern parts of the Old World. It has only accidentally\r\nstrayed to our shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n258. WILLET. _Catoptrophorus semipalmatus semipalmatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding north to the Middle States and\r\noccasionally straying to the Canadian border, especially in the\r\nMississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThese large waders are among the most abundant of the marsh or beach\r\nbirds. They breed in small companies in marshes, frequently in those\r\nwhich are covered with water at high tide, building a frail nest of\r\ngrasses and weeds, where it will be barely out of reach of the highest\r\nwater. The three or four eggs have a brownish, or sometimes greenish,\r\nbuff ground color and are blotched with umber, and have fainter markings\r\nof lilac. Size 2.00 × 1.50. Data.--Sandy Bank, South Carolina, May 3,\r\n1901. Nest on the ground, secreted in the high grass. Made of dead marsh\r\ngrass, lined with finer grasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 157: Western Sandpiper. Willet.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 156\r\n\r\n258a. WESTERN WILLET. _Catoptrophorus semipalmatus inornatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, breeding north to Manitoba and British\r\nColumbia. Casually found on the South Atlantic coast during migrations.\r\n\r\nA larger and paler form of the preceding species; length 15.5 inches.\r\nThe nesting habits are the same, and the eggs cannot be distinguished\r\nfrom those of the common Willet. Data.--Refugio, Texas, May 18, 1900. 4\r\neggs in a grass lined depression on the bay shore flat. Collector, J. W.\r\nPreston.\r\n\r\n\r\n259. WANDERING TATTLER. _Heteractitis incanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of North America, breeding from British Columbia\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nThis is a handsome species, uniform grayish above and white below,\r\nclosely barred (in summer) with blackish. During the breeding season it\r\nis found on the rugged coasts and islands of Alaska, and casually south.\r\nIt breeds in the marsh grass near the shores and along the banks of\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n260. RUFF. _Machetes pugnax._\r\n\r\nA common European species, occasionally found on the Atlantic coast of\r\nNorth America. It is a species remarkable for its pugnacity during the\r\nmating season; in size and appearance it is about like the Upland\r\nPlover, with the exception of the \"ruff\" which adorns the neck and\r\nbreast of the male bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n261. UPLAND PLOVER. _Bartramia longicauda._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, chiefly east of the Rocky Mountains, breeding\r\nfrom middle United States, northward.\r\n\r\nA handsome bird, 12 inches in length, generally known as the \"Upland\r\nPlover,\" from its habit of frequenting dry side hills, where it feeds\r\nupon grasshoppers and worms. It is a favorite bird with many sportsmen.\r\nIt builds a nest of grasses, on the ground in a tuft of grass in the\r\nmiddle of fields. The three or four eggs have a buff ground and are\r\nblotched with yellowish brown. Size 1.75 × 1.25. Data.--Stump Lake, N.\r\nD., June 10, 1897. Nest of grass, lined with wool, under a tuft of grass\r\nleft by the mower. Collector, Alf. Eastgate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 158: Wandering Tattler. Ruff.

BUFF-BREASTED SANDPIPER. _Tryngites subruficollis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of North America, breeding from the Hudson Bay region\r\nto the Arctic coast.\r\n\r\nA buffy colored species, with a peculiarly marbled back. Size 8.5 inches\r\nlong. It is an upland species like the last. The nests are scantily\r\nlined depressions in the ground. The eggs have a grayish white ground\r\nand are boldly blotched with rich brown and chestnut with fainter\r\nmarkings of lilac. Size 1.45 × 1.05. Data.--Cape Smythe, Alaska, June,\r\n1900. 4 eggs in a hollow in dry spot on a marsh. Collector, H. H.\r\nBodfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n263. SPOTTED SANDPIPER. _Actitis macularia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America from Hudson Bay southward, breeding\r\nthroughout its range.\r\n\r\nA small wader about 7.5 inches in length, with brownish gray upper\r\nparts, and white underparts thickly spotted with blackish, especially on\r\nthe breast and flanks. This is the most abundant of all the shore birds,\r\nand its \"peet-weet\" is a familiar sound to every country boy. It has a\r\npeculiar habit of continually moving its tail up and down, when at rest\r\non a stone or when running along the shore; from these characteristic\r\nactions it has received the very common names of \"Teeter-tail\" and\r\n\"Tip-up.\" They build their nests on the ground near ponds, brooks or\r\nmarshes, generally concealing it in a tuft of grass or weeds on the\r\nshore or in the high grass at the edge of the meadows. The eggs number\r\nfrom three to five and are of a grayish buff color, spotted and blotched\r\nwith blackish brown. The young, like those of all the shore birds, are\r\nhatched covered with down, and run about as soon as born. They are\r\nanxiously attended by the parents and at the least sign of danger,\r\nconceal themselves beneath a tuft of grass or behind a small stone,\r\nwhere they remain perfectly motionless until called by the old birds.\r\nThe adults frequently attempt to lead an enemy away from the young by\r\nfeigning a broken wing, or lameness. Size of eggs 1.35 × .90.\r\nData.--Parker County, Ind., May 22, 1901. Nest about six yards from bank\r\nof creek, among weeds on a sand bar; a hollow in the sand lined with\r\nweeds. Collector, Winfield S. Catlin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 160: Buff-breasted Sandpiper.

LONG-BILLED CURLEW. _Numenius americanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the South Atlantic states and northward in the\r\ninterior to Manitoba and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest of the family of shore birds, having a length of\r\nabout 24 inches. Its plumage is of a buffy color, much variegated above\r\nwith black and brown; the bill is strongly curved downward and is from\r\nfour to eight inches in length. Their nests are located on the ground in\r\nmeadows or on the prairies, and three or four eggs are laid, of a buff\r\nor greenish buff color, covered with numerous spots of brownish black.\r\nEggs of the common Curlew of Europe, have been very frequently used as\r\nbelonging to this species, but the eggs of our species have a lighter\r\nand more greenish ground, and the spots are smaller and more numerous.\r\nSize, 2.50 × 1.80.\r\n\r\n\r\n265. HUDSONIAN CURLEW. _Numenius hudsonicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and\r\nwintering south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is smaller (length 17 inches), darker, more grayish and has\r\na shorter bill than the preceding species. It also has white median and\r\nlateral stripes on the top of the head. The nesting habits are the same\r\nas those of the Long-billed species; the three or four eggs have a\r\nbrownish buff ground color and are blotched with blackish brown. Size\r\n2.25 × 1.60. Data.--McKenzie River, Arctic America. Nest a pile of\r\ngrass, moss and weeds on an island in the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 161: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Long-billed Curlew. Hudsonian Curlew.]\r\n[Illustration: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 160\r\n\r\n266. ESKIMO CURLEW. _Numenius borealis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and\r\nwintering in South America; migrating through the eastern half of the\r\nUnited States, more abundantly in the interior than on the coast.\r\n\r\nA still smaller species than the last (length 14 inches) and very\r\nsimilar to it. A few years ago this was considered the most abundant of\r\nthe curlews, but so persistently have they been hunted that they are now\r\npractically exterminated. They were the most unsuspicious of the shore\r\nbirds, and would allow the near approach of the gunner, and the penalty\r\nmay now be seen. Only a short while ago they were very often found,\r\nduring migration, in company with other waders such as the Golden or\r\nBlack-bellied Plovers. Their nests are simply hollows in the plains,\r\nlined with a few grasses, dried leaves, or moss. The three or four eggs\r\nare the same as the last for color but are smaller; size 2.00 × 1.45.\r\n\r\n\r\n267. WHIMBREL. _Numenius phaeopus._\r\n\r\nA European species casually appearing in Greenland; very similar to the\r\nHudsonian Curlew, but with the rump white.\r\n\r\nThis species is known as the Jack Curlew in England and Scotland, where\r\nit is very abundant, and is a favorite game bird. It breeds in the\r\nnorthern parts of Europe and Asia, and in the extreme north of Scotland\r\nand on the Shetland Islands. The eggs are laid in hollows on the ground\r\non higher parts of the marshes. The three or four eggs have an olive or\r\ngreenish brown color and are blotched with dark brown. Size 2.30 × 1.60.\r\nData.--Native, Iceland, May 29, 1900. Six eggs. Nest a depression in the\r\nground, lined with dried grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n268. BRISTLE-THIGHED CURLEW. _Numenius tahitiensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Islands and coast on the Asiatic side of the Pacific; casually\r\nfound in Alaska. A very peculiar species with many of the feathers on\r\nthe flanks terminating in long bristles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 162: Eskimo Curlew.]\r\n[Illustration: Olive brown.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 161\r\n\r\nPLOVERS. Family CHARADRIIDÆ\r\n\r\nPlovers are stouter built birds than those of the previous family, have\r\nlarger head, shorter necks and but three toes, the bill also is much\r\nharder and shorter.\r\n\r\n\r\n269. LAPWING. _Vanellus vanellus._\r\n\r\nAn abundant European species accidentally occurring on the Atlantic\r\ncoast. It may readily be recognized by its long black crest, black chin\r\nand throat, and white under parts. It breeds throughout temperate\r\nEurope, laying its eggs in hollows on the ground. The eggs have a dark\r\ngrayish buff ground and are spotted with black. Size 1.85 × 1.30.\r\n\r\n\r\n269.1. DOTTEREL. _Eudromias morinellus._\r\n\r\nA European bird supposed to have been accidentally taken on the Atlantic\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n\r\n270. BLACK-BELLIED PLOVER. _Squatarola squatarola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the Arctic regions and\r\nwintering from the Gulf States to northern South America.\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkably handsome species when in the summer dress. The\r\nupper parts are largely white with black spots and bars on the back,\r\nwings and tail; the throat, sides of head, breast and fore under parts,\r\nblack. In winter, brownish-black, somewhat mottled, above; below, dull\r\nwhite. Young similar to winter adults, but the back is spotted with\r\nyellowish-white. While these handsome plover migrate to some extent, and\r\nsometimes in large flocks, through the interior of the United States,\r\nthey are chiefly and most abundantly found on the coast. This species\r\nhas a very small hind toe. It is a very familiar bird to sportsmen and\r\ngunners, to whom it is generally known by the names of \"Bull-head,\" or\r\n\"Beetle-head Plover.\" They are very numerous in the fall, during which\r\nseason the underparts are entirely white. The eggs are either laid upon\r\nthe bare ground or upon a slight lining of grasses or dead leaves. They\r\nare three or four in number, brownish or greenish buff in color and\r\nboldly marked with black. Size 2.00 × 1.40. Data.--Point Barrow, Alaska,\r\nJune, 1900. Nest a small hollow on side of hillock, lined with dry\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 163: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 162\r\n\r\n[Illustration 164: BLACK-BELLIED PLOVER.]\r\n\r\nPage 163\r\n\r\n272. EUROPEAN GOLDEN PLOVER. _Charadrius apricarius._\r\n\r\nA European bird, similar to the next, casually found in Greenland.\r\n\r\nIt is a very abundant bird throughout Europe, breeding in the northern\r\nparts. Its habits, nests and eggs are the same as those of the American\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n\r\n272. GOLDEN PLOVER. _Charadrius dominicus dominicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and\r\nwintering south to Patagonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis handsome bird is about the same size as the Black-bellied Plover\r\n(10.5 inches long). No hind toe. Back and tail mottled with black and\r\nyellow; below, more or less entirely black to the tail. Young and winter\r\nadults, more or less spotted with yellow and blackish-brown above, and\r\ngrayish-white below, with indistinct streaks on the breast. Often\r\nconfused with the last species in this plumage, but is smaller, bill\r\nsmaller and more slender, and the axillars, or feathers nearest the\r\nbody, under the wings, are gray while those of the Black-bellied Plover\r\nare black. This species is now regarded as rare on the North Atlantic\r\ncoast during migrations, while in the interior it is more abundant than\r\nthe last species. They do not seem to be as suspicious as the\r\nBlack-bellies, and a flock will often allow a close approach, even when\r\nthey see you. They nest abundantly along the coast and islands of the\r\nArctic Ocean. The four eggs are very similar to those of the preceding,\r\nbut smaller. Size 1.90 × 1.30. Data.--Peel River, Arctic America, June\r\n1, 1898. Nest of grasses and leaves on the ground in the moss.\r\n\r\n\r\n272a. PACIFIC GOLDEN PLOVER. _Charadrius dominicus fulvus._\r\n\r\nRange.--An Asiatic species, breeding in northern Asia and on the islands\r\nand coast of Asia. Very like the preceding, but more golden color on the\r\nback and wings. Nesting and eggs the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 165: Black-bellied Plover.

Spaid.\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF KILLDEER.]\r\n\r\nPage 165\r\n\r\n273. Killdeer. _Oxyechus vociferus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America from the southern parts of Canada\r\nsouthward. Next to the Spotted Sandpiper, this bird is the most common\r\nof the shore birds in the United States. It is rarely seen in New\r\nEngland, but is common south of there and in the interior of the country\r\nto Canada.\r\n\r\nThey are very noisy birds, continually uttering their \"kil-deer,\r\nkil-deer\" from which they take their name. They nest anywhere on the\r\nground, generally near water, placing their nests in fields, cornfields\r\nor meadows. The eggs are drab or greenish buff and profusely spotted\r\nwith black. Size 1.50 × 1.10. Data.--Refugio county, Texas, May 11,\r\n1899. 4 eggs in a depression on the ground, lined with a few grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n274. SEMIPALMATED. _Ægialitis semipalmata._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding in the interior of Canada and wintering\r\nsouth from the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nSmall web between the bases of the two outer toes. Single broad, black\r\nband across the breast; black line from base of bill to eye. They are\r\nvery abundant on our seacoast in Fall, both in flocks composed entirely\r\nof their own kind, and also with Least and Semipalmated Sandpipers. They\r\nusually keep on the inner side of sandbars or muddy flats bordering\r\nmarshes, rather than on the open ocean beach. It is also found in\r\nsmaller flocks, about ponds and marshes in the interior of the country.\r\nThey are usually unsuspicious and will allow a close approach, or if you\r\nare still, will run by within a very few feet. Nest on the ground; eggs\r\nbuffy, sparsely specked with black, 1.30 × .90; June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 167: Grayish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Kildeer. Semi-palmated Plover.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 166\r\n\r\n\r\n275. RING PLOVER. _Ægialitis hiaticula._\r\n\r\nRange.--A European bird that breeds abundantly in Greenland. It nests in\r\ngreat numbers on the banks of streams and in fields, laying its eggs in\r\nhollows on the ground, generally without any lining. Their three or four\r\neggs are practically not distinguishable from those of the Semipalmated\r\nPlover, but larger; size, 1.40 x 1.00. The bird, too, is similar, but\r\nthe toes are not palmated, and the black breast band is wider.\r\n\r\n\r\n276. LITTLE RINGED PLOVER. _Ægialitis dubia._\r\n\r\nAn Old World species, accidentally occurring on the Pacific coast. Like\r\nthe last species, but smaller. The eggs, too, are smaller; size 1.20 x\r\n.85.\r\n\r\n\r\n277. PIPING PLOVER. _Ægialitis meloda._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, chiefly along the Atlantic coast,\r\nbreeding from the Carolinas north to Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nA handsome little bird, with a black crescent on each side of neck, a\r\nsmall black patch on top of the head, and without any black on the lores\r\nor ear coverts. It is the lightest colored of any of the eastern\r\nPlovers. Length, 7 inches. Young, similar, but the black replaced by\r\ngrayish, as is the case with the last species. This species, apparently,\r\nnever could be classed as abundant and of late years, it is becoming\r\nrather rare along our Atlantic coast; this is probably more due to the\r\nbuilding of summer resorts and homes along their former breeding grounds\r\nthan to hunters. They are rather more shy than the last species, but\r\nwill usually attempt to escape by running along the beach or by hiding,\r\nrather than by flight. Owing to their light colors it is very difficult\r\nto see them at any distance. They lay their eggs upon the sandy beaches\r\nin slight, and generally unlined, hollows. The eggs have a pale clay\r\ncolored ground and are sparsely specked with small black dots. Size 1.25\r\nx 1.00.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 168: Ring Plover.

SNOWY PLOVER. _Ægialitis nivosa._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds along the Pacific coast of the United States, and from\r\nTexas to Manitoba in the interior. Winters on the California coast and\r\nsouth to Chili.\r\n\r\nSnowy Plovers are very much like the Piping, but are smaller (length 6.5\r\ninches), have a longer and more slender bill, and have a small black\r\npatch on the side of head. It is the palest colored of the Plovers.\r\nLarge numbers of them nest along the Pacific coast and in Texas; north\r\nof Texas, in the interior, they are locally distributed. The eggs are\r\npale clay color, marked with small scratchy dots of black. Size 1.20 x\r\n.90. Data.--Newport Beach, California, May 1, 1897. Nest a hollow in the\r\nsand, a short distance above high water; lined with broken shell.\r\nCollector, Evan Davis.\r\n\r\n\r\n279.

WILSON'S PLOVER. _Octhodromus wilsonius._\r\n\r\nRange.--An abundant breeding species on the Gulf coast, coast of Lower\r\nCalifornia, and on the Atlantic coast north to Virginia, and casually\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nA common Plover, which may be distinguished from others of the genus by\r\nits comparatively large heavy black bill, and the single broad black\r\nband across the breast, and not extending around the back of the neck.\r\nThey nest on pebbly \"shingle\" or in the marsh, back of the beaches.\r\nTheir eggs are an olive gray color and are spotted and scratched with\r\nblackish brown, with some fainter markings of gray. Size 1.40 x 1.05.\r\nData.--Corpus Christi, Texas, May 10, 1899. 4 eggs laid on the ground\r\namong drifted grass on a salt marsh near town. Collector, Frank B.\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n281. MOUNTAIN PLOVER. _Podasocys montanus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains and prairies of western North America, breeding from the\r\ncentral portions north to Manitoba, and wintering in California and\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nA very peculiar species, inhabiting even the driest portions of the\r\nwestern prairies. It is 9 inches in length, and has a plumage of a pale\r\nbuffy tone. It seems to be less aquatic than any other American Plover\r\nand is rarely found in the vicinity of bodies of water. It nests on the\r\nground anywhere on the prairie, laying its eggs in a slight hollow. The\r\neggs are brownish gray in color and are spotted and blotched with\r\nblackish brown. Data.--Morgan county, Colorado, May 7, 1902. Nest a\r\nslight hollow on the ground, near a large cactus bed and close to a\r\nwater hole. No lining to nest. Collector, Glenn S. White.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 170: Olive gray.]\r\n[Illustration: Wilson's Plover.

Surf Bird. _Aphriza virgata._\r\n\r\nThis species, which is found on the Pacific coast from Alaska to Chili,\r\nseems to be the connecting link between the plovers and the Turnstones,\r\nhaving the habits of the latter combined with the bill of the former.\r\nIts nest and eggs are not known to have been yet discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n283. TURNSTONE. _Arenaria interpres._\r\n\r\nRange.--The distribution of this species, which is grayer above than the\r\nfollowing, is supposed to be confined, in America, to the extreme north\r\nfrom Greenland to Alaska. Its habits and eggs are precisely like the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n\r\n283a. RUDDY TURNSTONE. _Arenaria interpres morinella._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the Arctic regions, and migrates through all parts of\r\nthe United States, south to the southern parts of South America. This\r\nspecies has the upperparts variegated with reddish brown, black and\r\nwhite; the underparts are pure white, except for a black patch on the\r\nthroat, branching upward to the eye and back to the sides of the breast.\r\nIt has a peculiar, slightly up-turned bill, which is used, as their name\r\nimplies, for turning over pebbles and stones in their search for food.\r\nThey nest commonly in northern Labrador, about Hudson Bay and in Alaska,\r\nlaying their eggs in scantily lined hollows on the ground, near water.\r\nThe eggs are very peculiar and beautiful, having a light grayish or\r\ncream color ground, peculiarly marbled with many shades of brown and\r\nlilac. Size 1.65 × 1.10. Data.--Mackenzie River, Arctic America, June\r\n28, 1900. Four eggs in a grass lined depression in the sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 171: Creamy.]\r\n[Illustration: Turnstone.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 170\r\n\r\n284. BLACK TURNSTONE. _Arenaria melanocephala._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of North America, breeding from British Columbia\r\nnorthward, and wintering south to Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis species, which has the form and habits of the preceding, is\r\nblackish above and on the breast; the rump and the base of the tail are\r\nwhite, being separated from each other by the black tail coverts. Their\r\nnesting habits are in no wise different from those of the common\r\nturnstone. The eggs are similar, but the markings are not so strikingly\r\narranged. Size 1.60 × 1.10. Data.--Kutlik, Alaska, June 21, 1898. Nest\r\nsimply a depression in the sand on the sea beach.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER-CATCHERS. Family HÆMATOPODIDÆ\r\n\r\n285. EUROPEAN OYSTER-CATCHER. _Hæmatopus frazari._\r\n\r\nThis European species is very similar to the American one which follows.\r\nIt casually occurs in Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\n286. OYSTER-CATCHER. _Hæmatopus palliatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds on the coast of the South Atlantic States and Lower\r\nCalifornia and winters south to Patagonia. Oyster-catchers are\r\n\r\nlarge, heavy-bodied birds, with stocky red legs and long, stout red\r\nbills. The present species has the whole upper parts and entire head and\r\nneck, blackish; underparts and ends of secondaries, white; length, 19\r\ninches. They are abundant breeding birds on the sandy beaches of the\r\nSouth Atlantic States, and casually wander north to Nova Scotia. They\r\nlay their two or three eggs on the ground in slight hollows scooped out\r\nof the sand. The eggs are of a buffy or brownish buff color, and are\r\nirregularly spotted with blackish brown, with subdued markings of\r\nlavender. Size 2.20 × 1.50. Data.--Sandy Point, S. C., May 12, 1902.\r\nThree eggs on the sand just above high water mark; nest a mere\r\ndepression on a small \"sand dune\" lined with pieces of shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 172: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: American Oyster-catcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 171\r\n\r\n286.1. Frazar's Oyster-catcher. _Hæmatopus bachmani._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis species is darker on the back than the preceding, and the breast is\r\nmottled with dusky. Bill very long, heavy, compressed, and thin and\r\nchisel-like at the tip.\r\n\r\nBill and eyes red; legs flesh color; under parts white, and a white wing\r\nbar. These are large, awkward looking birds. It is not an uncommon wader\r\nin its somewhat restricted range. Its nesting habits are the same as\r\nthose of the preceding one, but the markings are generally more sharply\r\ndefined. The one figured is from a set in the collection of Mr. C. W.\r\nCrandall.\r\n\r\n\r\n287. BLACK OYSTER-CATCHER. _Hæmatopus bachmani._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of North America from Lower California north to\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nThis species is the same size as the Oyster-catcher, but the plumage is\r\nentirely black both above and below. They are found upon the rocky\r\ncoasts and islands, more frequently than upon sandy beaches. Their eggs\r\nare laid upon bare rocks or pebbles with no attempt at lining for the\r\nnest. The eggs are an olive buff in color, spotted and blotched with\r\nbrownish black. Size 2.20 × 1.55. Breeding throughout the Aleutian\r\nIslands, British Columbia and south to Lower California. Three or four\r\neggs are laid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 173: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: 287--286.1.]\r\n[Illustration: Olive buff.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 172\r\n\r\nJACANAS. Family JACANIDÆ\r\n\r\n288. Mexican Jacana. _Jacana spinosa._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical America, north in summer to the lower Rio Grande Valley\r\nin Texas, and casually to Florida.\r\n\r\nThis interesting species has most of its structural characters similar\r\nto the Plovers, but has more the appearance and habits of the Rails.\r\nThey are about eight inches long, the head and neck are black, the body\r\nchestnut, and the wings largely greenish yellow. They have long legs,\r\nlong toes and extremely long toe nails, a scaly leaf on the forehead,\r\nand a sharp spur on the shoulder of the wing. Owing to their long toes\r\nand nails, they are enabled to walk over floating weeds and rubbish that\r\nwould sink beneath their weight, otherwise. They build their nests on\r\nthese little floating islands in the marsh; they are also sometimes made\r\nof weeds and trash on floating lily pads. They lay from three to five\r\neggs of a yellowish olive color, curiously scrawled with brown and\r\nblack. Size 1.22 × .95. Data.--Tampico, Mexico, June 3, 1900. Three\r\neggs. Nest of weeds and drift on lily leaf floating in fresh water pond\r\nnear town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 174: Mexican Jacana.]\r\n[Illustration: Yellowish olive.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 173\r\n\r\n[Illustration 175: C.

GALLINÆ\r\n\r\nGROUSE, PARTRIDGES, ETC. Family TETRAONIDAE\r\n\r\nThe members of this family are birds of robust form, subdued (not\r\nbrightly colored) plumage, comparatively short legs and necks; the tarsi\r\nand toes are feathered in the Ptarmigan, the tarsi, only, feathered in\r\nthe Grouse, and the tarsi and toes bare in the Partridges and\r\nBob-whites. They feed upon berries, buds, grain and insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n289. BOB-WHITE. _Colinus virginianus virginianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of North Dakota and Texas and from the\r\nsouthern British Provinces to the Gulf coast.\r\n\r\nA celebrated \"game bird\" which has been hunted so assiduously in New\r\nEngland that it is upon the verge of extermination, and the covers have\r\nto be continually replenished with birds trapped in the south and west.\r\nThey frequent open fields, which have a luxuriant growth of weeds, or\r\ngrain fields in the fall. Their nests are built along the roadsides, or\r\nbeside stonewalls or any place affording satisfactory shelter. The nest\r\nis made of dried grasses and is arched over with grass or overhanging\r\nleaves so as to conceal the eggs. They lay from ten to twenty pure white\r\neggs, which are very frequently nest stained when found. Size 1.20 ×\r\n.95. Often two or three broods are raised in a season, but frequently\r\none or more broods are destroyed by rainy weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n289a. FLORIDA BOB-WHITE. _Colinus virginianus floridanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--This sub-species, which is found in the southern half of\r\nFlorida, is very much darker than the northern Bob-white, and is\r\nnumerously barred below with black. Its nesting habits and eggs are\r\nidentical with those of the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n289b. TEXAS BOB-WHITE. _Colinus virginianus texanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Texas; casually north to Kansas. A grayer variety of the\r\nBob-white. The nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of the\r\nBob-white, except that the eggs may average a trifle smaller. Size 1.18\r\n× .92.\r\n\r\n\r\n291. MASKED BOB-WHITE. _Colinus ridgwayi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Sonoran region of Mexico north to southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe female of this species is like that of the Texan Bob-white. Their\r\nnesting habits and eggs are in all respects like those of the other\r\nBob-whites. Size of eggs, 1.20 × .95.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 177: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Bobwhite. Florida Bobwhite.

MOUNTAIN QUAIL. _Oreortyx picta picta._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of North America from California to Washington.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest of the Partridges, being 11 inches in length. It is\r\nof a general grayish color, with chestnut throat patch, and chestnut\r\nflanks, barred with white. Two long plumes extend downward from the back\r\nof the head. This species nests abundantly in the mountainous portions\r\nof northern California and throughout Oregon, and is gradually\r\nincreasing in numbers in Washington. As a rule they nest only on the\r\nhigher mountain ranges, placing their nest of leaves under the\r\nprotection of an overhanging bush or tuft of grass. Their eggs number\r\nfrom six to fifteen, and are of a pale reddish buff color. Size 1.35 ×\r\n1.05.\r\n\r\n\r\n292a. PLUMED QUAIL. _Oreortyx picta plumifera._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountain ranges of California and Lower California, chiefly in\r\nthe southern parts of the former. This species is like the latter except\r\nthat it is grayer on the back of the head and neck. Its nesting habits\r\nand eggs are like the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n292b. SAN PEDRO QUAIL. _Oreortyx picta confinis._\r\n\r\nRange.--San Pedro Mountains, Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is grayer above than the preceding two, breeds only\r\nin the highest peaks of its range. Otherwise its nesting habits and eggs\r\nare the same as the other Plumed Partridges.\r\n\r\n\r\n293. SCALED QUAIL. _Callipepla squamata squamata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and southwestern border of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis blue gray species is 10 inches in length; the feathers on the neck\r\nand underparts have narrow dark borders, thus giving the plumage a scaly\r\nappearance, from which the birds take their name. They have a small tuft\r\nof whitish or buffy feathers on the top of the head. It is especially\r\nabundant in the dry arid portions of its range, being found often many\r\nmiles away from water. Their eggs are laid in a shallow hollow under\r\nsome small bush or cactus, and number from eight to sixteen; they are\r\ncreamy white, finely specked with buff or pale brownish. Size 1.25 ×\r\n.95.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 178: Reddish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Mountain Partridge. Scaled Partridge.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 177\r\n\r\n293a. CHESTNUT-BELLIED SCALED QUAIL. _Callipepla squamata\r\ncastanogastris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas and southward into Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is like the last with the addition of a chestnut patch\r\non the belly. Their breeding habits do not vary in any particular way\r\nfrom those of the Scaled Partridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n294. CALIFORNIA QUAIL. _Lophortyx californica californica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast region of California, Oregon, Washington and British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most beautiful of the Partridges, with its crest of\r\nfeathers rising from the crown and curving forwards so that the\r\nbroadened ends hang directly over the bill. It is about the size of the\r\npreceding species, and is distinguished from the following one by its\r\nwhite forehead, chestnut patch on the belly and the scaly appearance of\r\nthe feathers in that region, by its dark crown and the gray flanks with\r\nwhite streaks. They lay from eight to twenty eggs with a creamy white or\r\nbuffy ground color, handsomely blotched with shades of brown and\r\nyellowish brown. Size 1.20 × .93.\r\n\r\n\r\n294a. VALLEY PARTRIDGE. _Lophortyx californica vallicola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior portions of California, Oregon and Washington.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this grayer sub-species do not differ in any\r\nmanner from those of the above species. The eggs are indistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n295. GAMBEL QUAIL. _Lophortyx gambeli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States from Texas to California; north to\r\nUtah.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species differs from the California in the Chestnut crown\r\nand flanks, and the black patch on the belly. They are very abundant in\r\nArizona, both on the mountains and in the valleys, and apparently\r\nwithout any regard to the nearness to, or remoteness from a water\r\nsupply. They breed during May, laying their eggs on the ground under any\r\nsuitable cover. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those of the\r\nCalifornia Partridge, except that they average a trifle larger. Size\r\n1.25 × .95.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 179: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: California Partridge.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 178\r\n\r\n296. MEARNS QUAIL. _Cyrtonyx montezumæ mearnsi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north to southern Arizona and New Mexico, and to western\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nA remarkable species about 9 inches long; often called \"Fool Quail\"\r\nbecause of its eccentric and clownish markings, streaks and spots of\r\nblack, white, buff, gray and chestnut. It is met with in small flocks on\r\nthe mountains and less frequently in the valleys. It frequents scrubby\r\nwooded places rather than open hill sides and is very easy to approach\r\nand kill; this confidence or stupidity together with its clownish\r\nappearance are the reasons for its commonly used local name. Their nests\r\nare hollows in the ground, lined with grasses and concealed by\r\noverhanging tufts of grass. The eggs, which are pure white, are not\r\ndistinguishable with certainty from those of the Bob-white, but average\r\nlonger. Size 1.25 × .95.\r\n\r\n\r\n297. DUSKY GROUSE. _Dendragapus obscurus obscurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region from central Montana south to New Mexico.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Sage Grouse, this species is the largest of\r\nthe family, being about 20 inches in length. The general tone of its\r\nplumage below is gray; above, blackish gray and the tail blackish with a\r\nbroad terminal band of light gray. They frequent the wooded and\r\nespecially the coniferous districts, where they build their nests under\r\nfallen trees or at the bases of standing ones. They lay from six to ten\r\neggs of a buffy color, sparsely spotted and blotched with brownish. Size\r\n2.00 × 1.40.\r\n\r\n\r\n297a. SOOTY GROUSE. _Dendragapus obscurus fuliginosus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountain ranges along the Pacific coast from California to\r\nBritish Columbia.\r\n\r\nLike the last, this somewhat darker sub-species is met with in timbered\r\nregions, where its habits are about the same as those of the Ruffled\r\nGrouse, except, of course, that they are not nearly as shy as the Grouse\r\nin New England. Their eggs are laid in hollows beside stumps or under\r\nlogs. The eggs are buff colored, spotted with reddish brown. Size 2.00 ×\r\n1.40.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 180: Mearns Partridge.]\r\n[Illustration: Rich buff.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 179\r\n\r\n297b. RICHARDSON'S GROUSE. _Dendragapus obscurus richardsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Rocky Mountains from central Montana to British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nA dark variety with no terminal band of gray on the tail. Its habits,\r\nnesting and eggs are precisely like those of the preceding species.\r\n\r\n\r\n298. HUDSONIAN SPRUCE PARTRIDGE. _Canachites canadensis canadensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern United States and southern British Provinces; west to\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nA dark species, smaller than the last (15 inches long), and easily\r\nrecognized by its black throat and extensive black patch on the breast.\r\nThe habits of this species and the two varieties into which it has been\r\nsub-divided are the same; as a species, they are very tame, will not fly\r\nunless actually obliged to, and frequently allow themselves to be\r\nknocked down with sticks. Their nests are hollows in the leaves on the\r\nground, generally under the sheltering branches of a low spreading fir\r\ntree. The six to fifteen eggs are a bright buff color, blotched and\r\nspotted boldly with various shades of brown. Size 1.70 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n298b. ALASKA SPRUCE PARTRIDGE. _Canachites canadensis osgoodi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis variety is practically the same as the preceding, the birds not\r\nalways being distinguishable; the nest and eggs are the same as the\r\nCanada Grouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n298c. Canada Spruce Partridge. _Canachites canadensis canace._\r\n\r\nRange.--Labrador and the Hudson Bay region.\r\n\r\nLike the last, this variety is hardly to be distinguished from the\r\nHudsonian. Its nesting habits and eggs are the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 181: Bright buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Sooty Grouse. Spruce Grouse.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 180\r\n\r\n299. FRANKLIN'S GROUSE. _Canachites franklin franklini._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern United States and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis species is very similar to the Canada Grouse, the most apparent\r\ndifference being the absence of the brownish gray tip to the tail, and\r\nthe upper coverts are broadly tipped with white. This species, which is\r\nvery abundant in the northwest, has the same stupid habits of the\r\neastern bird. During the mating season, the males of both this and the\r\npreceding species have the same habit of \"drumming\" that the Ruffed\r\nGrouse has. Their nests are placed on the ground under bushes or fir\r\ntrees and from eight to fifteen eggs are laid. These are brownish buff\r\nin color, spotted and blotched with rich brown. They are very similar to\r\nthe eggs of the Canada Grouse. Data.--Moberly Peak, Cascade Mts.,\r\nBritish Columbia, June 9, 1902. 7 eggs in a slight hollow on the ground.\r\nCollector, G. F. Dippie.\r\n\r\n\r\n300. RUFFED GROUSE. _Bonasa umbellus umbellus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States from Minnesota to New England; south to\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe Ruffed Grouse is \"King of the Game Birds\" in the east, where it has\r\nbeen hunted so freely, that it has become very wary and requires a\r\nskillful marksman to bring it down. Because of the cutting off of all\r\nheavy timber, and the vigor with which they are pursued by hunters, they\r\nare becoming very scarce in New England, and within a few years they\r\nwill probably be practically extinct in that section. Their favorite\r\nresorts are heavily timbered woods or low growth birches. Their nests\r\nare hollows in the leaves under fallen trees, beside some stump or\r\nconcealed among the small shoots at the base of a large tree. The bird\r\nsits very close, but when she does fly, goes with the familiar rumble\r\nand roar which always disconcerts the novice, the wind created by her\r\nsudden flight generally causing the leaves to settle in the nest and\r\nconceal the eggs. They lay from eight to fifteen eggs, of a brownish\r\nbuff color, sometimes with a few faint markings of brown, but generally\r\nunspotted. Size 1.55 × 1.15. The young of all the Partridges and Grouse\r\nare born covered with down and follow their parents soon after leaving\r\nthe shell. The adults are very skillful in leading enemies away from\r\ntheir young, feigning lameness, broken wings, etc. The nesting habits\r\nand eggs of the three sub-species are precisely the same in every\r\nrespect as those of this bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 182: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Ruffed Grouse.]\r\n[Illustration: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 181\r\n\r\n[Illustration 183: RUFFED GROUSE.]\r\n\r\nPage 182\r\n\r\n300a.

WILLOW PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus lagopus lagopus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions, in America south nearly to the United States\r\nborder, and casually to Maine.\r\n\r\nPtarmigan are Grouse-like birds, feathered to the toe nails; they have\r\nmany changes of plumage, in winter being nearly pure white, and in\r\nsummer largely reddish brown or grayish, barred with black. In the\r\nbreeding plumage they have red comb-like wattles over the eye. In other\r\nseasons, their plumage varies in all degrees between winter and summer.\r\nThey nest on the ground in hollows among the leaves, lined with a few\r\ngrasses, and sometimes feathers. They lay from six to sixteen eggs which\r\nhave a ground color of buff or brownish buff, heavily speckled, blotched\r\nand marbled with blackish brown. Size 1.75 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n301a. ALLEN'S PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus lagopus alleni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Newfoundland. A very similar bird to the preceding; eggs\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n302. ROCK PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus rupestris rupestris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Chiefly in the interior of British America, from the southern\r\nportions to Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nA species with a smaller bill and in summer a grayer plumage, more\r\nfinely barred with black. Its nesting habits are the same as the other\r\nspecies, it nesting on the ground in such localities as would be\r\nfrequented by the Ruffed Grouse. Its eggs cannot be positively\r\ndistinguished from those of the Willow Ptarmigan. Size 1.70 × 1.20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 185: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Willow Ptarmigan. Rock Ptarmigan.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 184\r\n\r\n302a. REINHARDT'S PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus rupestris reinhardi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Labrador and Greenland; an eastern variety of the preceding\r\nspecies. Its habits, nesting habits and eggs are just the same as those\r\nof Rock Ptarmigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n302b. NELSON'S PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus rupestris nelsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Unalaska, of the Aleutian chain. An abundant species in its\r\nrestricted range, making its nest on the ground in the valleys. Eggs\r\nlike the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n302c. TURNER'S PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus rupestris atkhensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Atka Island, of the Aleutian chain. Nests and eggs not\r\ndistinctive.\r\n\r\n\r\n302d. TOWNSEND'S PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus rupestris townsendi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Kyska Island of the Aleutian group.\r\n\r\nOn account of the constantly changing plumage of these birds, while\r\ninteresting, they are very unsatisfactory to study, and it is doubtful\r\nif anyone can identify the different sub-species of the Rock Ptarmigan,\r\ngranting that there is any difference, which is doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n302.1. EVERMANN'S PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus evermanni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Attu Island, of the Aleutian group.\r\n\r\nThis is, in summer, the darkest of the Ptarmigans, having little or no\r\nrufous and much blackish. The nesting habits and eggs are the same as\r\nthose of the Rock Ptarmigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n303. WELCH'S PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus welchi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nThis species, in summer, is more grayish than the Rock Ptarmigan, and is\r\nvery finely vermiculated with blackish. It is a perfectly distinct\r\nspecies from the Allen Ptarmigan, which is the only other species found\r\non the island. They inhabit the higher ranges and hills in the interior\r\nof the island, where they are quite abundant. They build their nests on\r\nthe ground under protection of overhanging bushes. The eggs are laid in\r\na hollow in the dead leaves, sometimes with a lining of grasses. The\r\neggs do not differ in size or appearance from those of the Rock\r\nPtarmigan. Data.--Newfoundland, June 3, 1901. Nest a slight hollow in\r\nthe moss, besides a fallen stump; lined with a few feathers. Collector,\r\nE. H. Montgomery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 186: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 185\r\n\r\n304. WHITE-TAILED PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus leucurus leucurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Higher ranges of the Rocky Mountains, from New Mexico north to\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nPtarmigan are remarkable birds in that they are in an almost continual\r\nstate of molting, nearly every month in the year showing them in\r\ndifferent stages of plumage, ranging from the snow-white winter dress to\r\nthe summer one in which reddish-brown prevails on Willow Ptarmigan and a\r\nblack and gray barred effect predominates on the other species. Notice\r\nthat they are feathered to the toes, in winter the feathers on the toes\r\ngrowing dense and hair-like, not only protecting the toes from the cold\r\nbut making excellent snowshoes which enable them to walk with impunity\r\nover the lightest snow.\r\n\r\nPtarmigan form the staple article of diet for northern foxes, and were\r\nit not for the fact that their plumage changes to correspond to the\r\nappearance of the ground at the various seasons they would fare hardly\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nIn spring the little red combs above the eyes of the males are swollen\r\nand conspicuous. At this season they strut and perform curious antics,\r\nsuch as all Grouse are noted for.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from any of the preceding in having at all seasons\r\nof the year, a white tail; it is also somewhat smaller than the Rock\r\nPtarmigan. They nest abundantly near the summits of the ranges in\r\nColorado, making their nests among the rocks, and generally lining them\r\nwith a few grasses. During June, they lay from six to twelve eggs having\r\na creamy background, speckled and blotched with chestnut brown. Size\r\n1.70 x 1.15.\r\n\r\n\r\n304a. KENAI WHITE-TAILED PTARMIGAN. _Lagopus leucurus peninsularis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Kenai Peninsular, Alaska. A similar but paler (in summer)\r\nvariety of the preceding. The nesting habits or eggs will not differ.\r\n\r\n\r\n305. PRAIRIE CHICKEN. _Tympanuchus americanus americanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--The prairies, chiefly west of the Mississippi; north to\r\nManitoba, east to Ohio, and west to Colorado.\r\n\r\nThis familiar game bird of the west is about 18 inches in length,\r\nbrownish above and grayish below, with bars of brownish black both above\r\nand below. In the place of the ruffs of the Ruffled Grouse, are long\r\ntufts of rounded or square ended feathers, and beneath these a peculiar\r\nsac, bright orange in the\r\n\r\n[Illustration 187: Olive Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPag 186\r\n\r\nbreeding season, and capable of being inflated to the size of a small\r\norange; this is done when the bird makes its familiar \"booming\" noise.\r\nThey are very good \"table birds\" and although they are still very\r\nabundant in most of their range, so many are being killed for market,\r\nthat it has become necessary to make more stringent laws relating to the\r\nkilling and sale of Pinnated Grouse, as they are often called. They nest\r\nanywhere on the prairie, in hollows on the ground under overhanging\r\nbushes or tufts of grass. They lay from eight to fifteen eggs having a\r\nbuffy or olive buff ground color, sparingly and finely sprinkled with\r\nbrown; size 1.70 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n305a. ATTWATER PRAIRIE CHICKEN. _Tympanuchus americanus attwateri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast region of Louisiana and Texas.\r\n\r\nThis is a slightly smaller and darker variety of the Pinnated Grouse.\r\nIts eggs cannot be distinguished from those of the more northerly\r\ndistributed bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n306. HEATH HEN. _Tympanuchus cupido._\r\n\r\nRange.--Island of Martha's Vineyard, Mass.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the preceding, but has the scapulars more\r\nbroadly tipped with buff, the axillars barred, and the pinnated feathers\r\non the neck pointed. It is slightly smaller than the western species. It\r\nis found on the wooded portions of the island, where its breeding habits\r\nare the same as those of the Ruffed Grouse. Mr. Brewster probably has\r\nthe only authentic set of the eggs of this species. They are of a\r\nyellowish green color and are unspotted. Size 1.70 × 1.25. A number of\r\nPrairie Hens liberated on the island several years ago are apparently\r\nthriving well, and nests found there now would be fully as apt to belong\r\nto this species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 188:(baby birds)]\r\n[Illustration: Prairie Chicken. Heath Hen.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 187\r\n\r\n307. LESSER PRAIRIE CHICKEN. _Tympanuchus pallidicinctus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Prairies from southwestern Kansas through Indian Territory to\r\nwestern Texas.\r\n\r\nA smaller and paler species than the Prairie Chicken. Never as abundant\r\nas the common Pinnated Grouse, this species appears to be becoming\r\nscarcer each year. Its nests are concealed under overhanging brush or\r\nplaced under a large tuft of prairie grass, and are generally lined with\r\na few grasses or leaves. They lay from eight to twelve eggs of a buffy\r\ncolor, much lighter than those of the Prairie Chicken, and unmarked.\r\nSize 1.65 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n308. SHARP-TAILED GROUSE. _Pedioecetes phasianellus phasianellus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of British America, from the United States boundary\r\nnorthwest to the Yukon.\r\n\r\nSharp-tailed Grouse are similar in form to the Prairie Chicken, but are\r\nsomewhat smaller and very much lighter in color, being nearly white\r\nbelow, with arrowhead markings on the breast and flanks. This species is\r\nvery abundant in Manitoba and especially so on the plains west of Hudson\r\nBay. Their nests are generally concealed under a thicket or a large tuft\r\nof grass, and are lined with grasses and feathers. They lay from six to\r\nfifteen eggs of a drab color, very minutely specked all over with brown.\r\nSize 1.70 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n308a. COLUMBIAN SHARP-TAILED GROUSE. _Pedioecetes phasianellus\r\ncolumbianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern United States and British Columbia to central\r\nAlaska. Both the nesting habits and eggs of this variety are the same as\r\nthe last, with which species, the birds gradually intergrade as their\r\nranges approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n308b. PRAIRIE SHARP-TAILED GROUSE. _Pedioecetes phasianellus\r\ncampestris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains of the United States from the Mississippi to the Rockies.\r\nThis sub-species shades directly into the two preceding where their\r\nranges meet, and only birds from the extreme parts of the range of each\r\nshow any marked differences. The nesting habits and eggs of all three\r\nare not to be distinguished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 189: Pale buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Buffy drab.]\r\n[Illustration: Prairie Sharp-tailed Grouse.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 188\r\n\r\n309. SAGE HEN. _Centrocercus urophasianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Sage plains of the Rocky Mountain region from British Columbia\r\nto New Mexico, and from California to Dakota. This handsome bird is the\r\nlargest of the American Grouse, being about 30 inches long (the hen bird\r\nis about six inches shorter). It may easily be recognized by its large\r\nsize, its peculiar graduated tail with extremely sharp pointed feathers,\r\nand the black belly and throat. Their nests are hollows scratched out in\r\nthe sand, under the sage bushes, generally with no lining. The nesting\r\nseason is during April and May, they laying from six to twelve eggs of a\r\ngreenish drab color, spotted with brown. Size 2.15 × 1.50.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHEASANTS. Family PHASIANIDÆ\r\n\r\n* * * RING-NECKED PHEASANT. _Phasianus torquatus._\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Pheasants have been introduced into the United\r\nStates, among them being the Ring-necked, English, and Green Pheasants.\r\nThe Ring-necked species seems to be the only one that has obtained a\r\nreally strong foothold, it being now very abundant in Oregon and\r\nWashington, and adjacent states, and also found in abundance on many\r\ngame preserves in the east. The males of any of the species may at once\r\nbe distinguished from any of our birds by the long tail. Their nests are\r\nhollows in the leaves under tufts of grass or bushes. They lay from\r\neight to fourteen eggs of a buff or greenish buff color, unmarked; size\r\n1.50 × 1.30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 190: Sage Hen.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale greenish drab.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 189\r\n\r\n[Illustration 191: RING-NECKED PHEASANT.]\r\n\r\nPage 190\r\n\r\nTURKEYS. Family MELEAGRIDÆ\r\n\r\n310. Wild Turkey. _Meleagris gallopavo silvestris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States from southern Middle States south to\r\ncentral Florida and west to the Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas.\r\nThese magnificent birds, which once ranged over the whole of eastern\r\nUnited States, are being yearly confined to a smaller range, chiefly\r\nbecause of the destruction of their natural covers, and from persecution\r\nby hunters. They are generally very wary birds and either escape by\r\nrunning through the underbrush or by flying as soon as a human being\r\nappears in sight. Their nests are made under tangled growths of\r\nunderbrush or briers. Their eggs, which are laid during April and May,\r\nrange from eight to sixteen in number. They are of a buff color\r\nsprinkled and spotted with brownish. Size 2.55 × 1.90. Data.--Hammond,\r\nLa., April 17, 1897. Fifteen eggs. Nest hollow scraped in the ground\r\nunder a bush on the edge of a pine woods; lined with grasses and leaves.\r\nCollector, E. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n\r\n310a. MERRIAM'S TURKEY. _Meleagris gallopavo merriami._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States from Colorado south through western\r\nTexas, New Mexico and Arizona to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis variety is abundant throughout its range, its nesting habits and\r\neggs being practically indistinguishable from those of the eastern form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 192: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Sage Hen. Wild Turkey.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 191\r\n\r\n310b. FLORIDA TURKEY. _Meleagris gallopavo osceola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Florida.\r\n\r\nA small variety of the Wild Turkey, about 42 inches long. They breed in\r\nthe tangled thickets in the higher portions of the southern half of\r\nFlorida, laying from ten to sixteen eggs of a brighter and deeper buff\r\ncolor than the northern variety, and smaller; size 2.30 × 1.75. Their\r\nnests are generally lined with grasses and occasionally with feathers.\r\nThe female sits very close when incubating and will not fly until almost\r\ntrod upon, trusting to her variegated markings to conceal her from\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n310c. RIO GRANDE TURKEY. _Meleagris gallopavo intermedia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lowlands of the southern parts of Texas and northern Mexico. A\r\nsub-species which differs slightly in plumage and not at all in nesting\r\nhabits or eggs from the common Wild Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURASSOWS AND GUANS. Family CRACIDÆ\r\n\r\n311. CHACHALACA. _Ortalis vetula mccalli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern portions of Mexico, north to the Lower Rio Grande Valley\r\nin Texas.\r\n\r\nA very peculiar grayish colored bird with a greenish gloss to the back,\r\nand a long, broad tail, quite long legs, and with the face and sides of\r\nthe throat devoid of feathers. They are very abundant birds in some\r\nlocalities, and very noisy during the breeding season, their notes\r\nresembling a harsh trumpeting repetition of their name. They are ground\r\ninhabiting birds, but nest in low bushes. Their nests are made of\r\nsticks, twigs, leaves, or moss and are generally frail, flat structures\r\nonly a few feet above the ground. During April, they lay from three to\r\nfive buffy white eggs, the shell of which is very rough and hard. Size\r\n2.25 × 1.55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 193: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Buffy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Chachalaca.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 192\r\n\r\nPIGEONS AND DOVES. Order XI. COLUMBÆ\r\n\r\nFamily COLUMBIDAE\r\n\r\nPigeons and doves are distributed throughout nearly every temperate and\r\ntropical country on the globe, nearly five hundred species being known,\r\nof which twelve occur within our limits. Their plumage is generally soft\r\nand subdued colors, the head small, the wings strong and the flight\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n312. BAND-TAILED PIGEON. _Columba fasciata fasciata._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Rocky Mountains and westward to the Pacific, from British\r\nColumbia south to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis large species may be generally recognized by the white crescent on\r\nthe nape; it is about 15 inches in length. They nest abundantly on the\r\nmountain ranges, sometimes in large flocks, and again, only a few pairs\r\ntogether. Their nests are rude platforms of sticks and twigs either in\r\nbushes or in large trees in heavily wooded districts. The two eggs which\r\nare laid during May or June are pure white in color, and like those of\r\nall the pigeons, equally rounded at each end. Size 1.55 × 1.10.\r\n\r\n\r\n312a. VIOSCA'S PIGEON. _Columba fasciata vioscæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California. This is a paler variety of the\r\npreceding species and is not noticeably different in its habits, nesting\r\nor eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n313. RED-BILLED PIGEON. _Columba flavirostris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and Central America, north to southern Texas, Arizona and\r\nNew Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species, characterized by its red bill, purplish colored head, neck\r\nand breast and absence of iridescent markings, is abundant in the valley\r\nof the Lower Rio Grande, where they build their frail nests in thickets\r\nand low bushes, and during May and June lay their white eggs. Size of\r\neggs, 1.55 × 1.05.\r\n\r\n\r\n314. WHITE-CROWNED PIGEON. _Columba leucocephala._\r\n\r\nRange.--Resident of the West Indies; in summer, found on the Florida\r\nKeys. This species, which can be identified by its white crown, nests in\r\ntrees or mangroves on certain of the Florida Keys, laying its two white\r\neggs on its rude platform of sticks and twigs. Size of eggs 1.40 × 1.05.\r\nNests in April and May.\r\n\r\n\r\n314.1. SCALED PIGEON. _Columba squamosa._\r\n\r\nA West Indian species, a single specimen of which was taken at Key West,\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nA dark colored species, with purplish head, neck and breast; named from\r\nthe scaly appearance of the iridescent feathers on the sides of the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 194: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 193\r\n\r\n315. PASSENGER PIGEON. _Ectopistes migratorius._\r\n\r\nRange.--Formerly, North America east of the Rockies; casually seen in\r\nthe upper Mississippi Valley, now extinct.\r\n\r\nA handsome species (see frontispiece) with ruddy underparts, grayish\r\nupperparts and a long graduated tail. This species years ago found in\r\nflocks of thousands or millions, is now practically exterminated,\r\nchiefly by being hunted and trapped. A few pairs probably now nest in\r\nthe interior, from northern United States to Hudson Bay. Their nests are\r\nvery rude, frail platforms of twigs, on which two white eggs are laid,\r\nthey being longer and narrower, comparatively, than those of other\r\nspecies. Size of eggs, 1.50 × 1.02. Data.--Southwest shore of Lake\r\nManitoba, June 1, 1891. Nest of twigs in an aspen tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n316. Mourning Dove. _Zenaidura macroura carolinensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America from New England, Manitoba and British Columbia,\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nNow that the Passenger Pigeon has disappeared, this species becomes the\r\nonly one found in the east, with the exception of the little Ground Dove\r\nin the South Atlantic and Gulf States. While, sometimes, small flocks of\r\nthem nest in a community, they generally nest in companies of two or\r\nthree pairs. Their nests are generally at a low elevation, in trees,\r\nbushes and often upon the ground. Their nests are made entirely of twigs\r\nand rootlets, and eggs may be found from early in April until the latter\r\npart of September, as they often raise two or three broods a season. The\r\ntwo eggs are white. Size 1.15 × .80. Data.--Refugio Co., Texas, May 3,\r\n1899. Two eggs laid on the ground in a slight cradle of twigs.\r\nCollector, James J. Carroll.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 195: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Passenger Pigeon.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Mourning Dove.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 194\r\n\r\n317. ZENAIDA DOVE. _Zenaida zenaida._\r\n\r\nRange.--West Indies; in summer, on the Florida Keys, but not in great\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar in size to the Mourning Dove, but it has a short\r\nand square tail, and the secondaries are tipped with white, and the\r\nunderparts more ruddy. They generally nest upon the ground, but\r\noccasionally in small bushes, laying two white eggs a trifle larger than\r\nthose of the preceding species. Size 1.20 × .90. The nests are made of\r\ngrasses and twigs, on the ground under bushes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 196: NEST AND EGGS OF MOURNING DOVE. H. B. Stough.]\r\n[Illustration.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 195\r\n\r\n318. WHITE-FRONTED DOVE. _Leptotila fulviventris brachyptera._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and Central America north to southern Texas.\r\n\r\nSlightly larger than the last, much paler below, with no black ear mark\r\nas in the two preceding species, and with the forehead whitish. They\r\nbuild their nests of sticks, grasses and weeds, and place them in\r\ntangled vines and thickets a few feet from the ground. Their two eggs,\r\nwhich are laid in May and June, have a creamy white or buffy color. Size\r\n1.15 × .85. They cannot be called a common species within our borders.\r\n\r\n\r\n319. WHITE-WINGED DOVE. _Melopelia asiatica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Central America, Mexico and the southwestern border of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis species is 12 inches in length, has a black patch on the ear\r\ncoverts, white tips to the greater and lesser coverts and some of the\r\nsecondaries, and broad white tips to the outer tail feathers, which are\r\nblack. This species is very abundant in some localities within our\r\nborders. Their nests are very frail platforms of twigs placed in trees\r\nor bushes or precariously suspended among tangled vines. Their two eggs\r\nare white or creamy white, and measure 1.15 × .85.\r\n\r\n\r\n320. GROUND DOVE. _Columbigallina passerina terrestris._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States to eastern Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Ground Doves are the smallest of the family, measuring but about 6.5\r\ninches in length. Their nesting habits and eggs are exactly like those\r\nof the next to be described. They are very abundant, especially along\r\nthe South Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n320a. MEXICAN GROUND DOVE. _Chæmepelia passerinus pallescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Border of the United States from Texas to southern California\r\nand southward.\r\n\r\nThis paler sub-species builds a nest of twigs and weeds, placing the\r\nflat structure either in low bushes or on the ground. Their two white\r\neggs are laid during April to July, they sometimes rearing two broods a\r\nseason. Size of eggs, .85 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n320b. BERMUDA GROUND DOVE. _Chæmepelia passerina bermudiana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Bermuda. Smaller and paler than the last; otherwise the same in\r\nnesting habits and eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White-fronted Dove. White-winged Dove.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 196\r\n\r\n321. INCA DOVE. _Scardafella inca._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican border of the United States south to Central America and\r\nLower California.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is about the size of the last, but its tail is\r\nlonger and graduated, consequently its length is greater, it being about\r\n8 inches long. It is not an uncommon species along our Mexican border,\r\nbut is not nearly as abundant as is the Ground Dove. It is often called\r\n\"Scaled Dove\" because of the blackish edges of nearly all its feathers.\r\nThey build fairly compact nests of twigs, rootlets and weeds, these\r\nbeing placed in bushes at a low elevation. They are two in number and\r\npure white. Size .85 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n322. KEY WEST QUAIL DOVE. _Geotrygon chrysia._\r\n\r\nRange.--West Indies, rarely found at Key West, although supposed to have\r\nbeen common there in Audubon's time. This species is of about the size\r\nof the Mourning Dove, has rusty colored upper parts, and is whitish\r\nbelow, the white below the eye being separated from that of the throat\r\nby a stripe of dusky from the base of the bill. They nest in trees,\r\nlaying two buffy white eggs. Size 1.15 × .9O.\r\n\r\n\r\n322.1. RUDDY QUAIL DOVE. _Geotrygon montana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Central America, north to eastern Mexico and the West Indies;\r\nonce taken at Key West. This species is similar to the last but has no\r\nwhite streak under the eye, and the underparts are buffy. Eggs, creamy\r\nwhite. Size 1.15 × .90.\r\n\r\n\r\n323. BLUE-HEADED QUAIL DOVE. _Starnoenas cyanocephala._\r\n\r\nRange.--Cuba, accidentally straying to Key West, but not in recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful species, with a bright blue crown, black throat and\r\nstripe through the eye, separated by a white line under the eye. The\r\nrest of the plumage is of a brownish or rusty color. Eggs buffy white.\r\nSize 1.30 × 1.05.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 198: Inca Dove.

Order XII. RAPTORES\r\n\r\nAMERICAN VULTURES. Family CATHARTIDAE\r\n\r\nVultures are peculiarly formed birds of prey, having a bare head and\r\nneck, a lengthened bill strongly hooked at the end for tearing flesh,\r\nand long, strong, broad wings upon which they float in the air for hours\r\nat a time without any visible flapping. They are scavengers and do great\r\nservice to mankind by devouring dead animal matter, that, if allowed to\r\nremain, would soon taint the atmosphere. Their eyesight and sense of\r\nsmell is very acute. They do not, except in very unusual cases, capture\r\ntheir prey, but feed upon that which has been killed or died of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n324. CALIFORNIA VULTURE. _Gymnogyps californianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Apparently now restricted to the coast ranges of California,\r\ncasually inland to Arizona, and formerly to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis large bird, which weighs about 20 pounds, measures about 4 feet in\r\nlength, and has an expanse of wings of about 10 feet. Its plumage is\r\nblackish with lengthened lanceolate feathers about the neck, and with\r\nthe greater wing coverts broadly tipped with grayish white (in very old\r\nbirds). The birds are very rare in their restricted range and are\r\nbecoming scarcer each year, owing to their being shot and their nests\r\nrobbed. While the eggs are very rarely found and only secured at a great\r\nrisk, they are not as unobtainable as many suppose, as may be seen from\r\nthe fact that one private collection contains no less than six perfect\r\nspecimens of the eggs and as many mounted birds. These birds lay but a\r\nsingle egg, placing it generally in caves or recesses in the face of\r\ncliffs, hundreds of feet from the ground, and often in inaccessible\r\nlocations. The eggs are of an ashy gray color and measure about 4.45 ×\r\n1.55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 200: Ashy gray.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 199\r\n\r\n325. TURKEY VULTURE. _Cathartes aura septentrionalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--America, from New Jersey on the Atlantic coast, Manitoba and\r\nBritish Columbia, south to southern South America, wintering in the\r\nsouthern half of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of this small Buzzard (length 30 inches) is blackish brown,\r\nthe naked head being red. It is very common in the southern and central\r\nportions of its range, where it frequents the streets and door yards\r\npicking up any refuse that is edible. It is a very graceful bird while\r\non the wing, and can readily be identified when at a distance from the\r\nfact that, when in flight, the tips of the wings curve upward. The two\r\neggs which constitute a set are laid upon the ground between large\r\nrocks, in hollow stumps, under logs, or between the branching trunks of\r\nlarge trees, generally in large woods. They frequently nest in\r\ncommunities and again, only a single pair may be found in the woods. Its\r\nnesting season ranges from March until June in the different localities.\r\nThe eggs are creamy or bluish white, spotted and blotched with shades of\r\nbrown, and with fainter markings of lavender. Size 2.70 × 1.85.\r\n\r\n\r\n326. BLACK VULTURE. _Catharista uruba._\r\n\r\nRange.--More southerly than the preceding; north regularly to North\r\nCarolina and southern Illinois, and west to the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThis species is about the same size, or slightly smaller than the Turkey\r\nVulture; its plumage is entirely black as is also the naked head, and\r\nbill. In the South Atlantic and Gulf States, the present species is even\r\nmore abundant than the preceding, and might even be said to be partially\r\ndomesticated. The nesting habits are the same as those of the Turkey\r\nBuzzard but their eggs average longer and the ground color is pale\r\ngreenish or bluish white rather than creamy. They are spotted and\r\nblotched the same. Size 3.00 × 2.00.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 201: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: 324--325.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 200\r\n\r\n[Illustration 202: Bluish white.\r\nEGG OF BLACK VULTURE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST AND EGGS OF TURKEY VULTURE.\r\nN. W. Swayne.]\r\n\r\nPage 201\r\n\r\nKITES, HAWKS AND EAGLES. Family BUTEONIDÆ\r\n\r\nThe members of this family are chiefly diurnal; they get their living by\r\npreying upon smaller animals or birds. They have strong sharply hooked\r\nbills, powerful legs and feet armed with strong, curved and sharply\r\npointed talons.\r\n\r\n\r\n327. SWALLOW-TAILED KITE. _Elanoides forficatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern United States; casually north to New York and Manitoba.\r\n\r\nThis most beautiful Kite can never be mistaken for any other; its whole\r\nhead, neck and underparts are snowy white, while the back, wings and\r\ntail are glossy blue black, the wings being very long and the tail long\r\nand deeply forked. The extreme length of the bird is 24 inches. As a\r\nrule nests of this bird are placed high up in the tallest trees; they\r\nare made of sticks, weeds and moss. Two eggs, or rarely three,\r\nconstitute a full set. They are white or bluish white, spotted with\r\nbrown. The one figured is an unusually handsome marked specimen in the\r\ncollection of Mr. C. W. Crandall. Average size of eggs, 1.80 × 1.50.\r\nData.--Yegna Creek bottoms, Texas, April 27, 1891. Two eggs. Nest of\r\nsticks and green moss, the same moss also being used for lining; in an\r\nelm tree 80 feet up.\r\n\r\n\r\n328. White-tailed Kite. _Elanus leucurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern United States, north to the Carolinas, Illinois and\r\nmiddle California.\r\n\r\nThis species can be recognized by its light bluish gray mantle, black\r\nshoulders and white tail. It is a very active species, feeding upon\r\ninsects and reptiles, and small birds and mammals. The nests of these\r\nspecies are placed in trees at quite an elevation from the ground, being\r\nmade of sticks, weeds and leaves. The eggs are creamy white, profusely\r\nblotched and spotted with reddish brown and umber. Size 1.65 × 1.25.\r\nData.--Los Angeles, Cal., April 9, 1896. Nest in fork of willows about\r\n25 feet up. Made of willow twigs and weed stalks, lined with pieces of\r\nbark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 203: Swallow-tailed Kite.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 202\r\n\r\n329. MISSISSIPPI KITE. _Ictinia mississippiensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southeastern United States, north to South Carolina and\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nA small species (length 14 inches) with the head, neck, and underparts\r\ngray, and the back, wings and tail blackish, the tips of the secondaries\r\nbeing grayish. They live almost exclusively upon insects, such as\r\ngrasshoppers, and small reptiles. They build their nests of sticks and\r\nweeds well up in tall trees. The eggs are two or three in number and\r\nnormally bluish white, unmarked, but occasionally with very faint spots\r\nof pale brown. Size 1.65 × 1.25. Data.--Giddings, Texas, May 31, 1887.\r\nNest of sticks and weeds, with green pecan leaves in the lining; placed\r\nin the top of a live oak sapling, 20 feet from the ground. Collector, J.\r\nA. Singley.\r\n\r\n\r\n330. EVERGLADE KITE. _Rostrhamus sociabilis._\r\n\r\nRange.--South America, north to southern Florida and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar species has a long, slender, curved bill, blackish\r\nplumage, with white rump and bases of outer tail feather. They feed\r\nlargely upon snails, both land and water varieties. They nest at a low\r\nelevation in bushes or under brush, often over the water. The nests are\r\nof sticks, weeds and leaves. The three eggs are light greenish white,\r\nspotted and splashed with chestnut brown. Size, 1.70 × 1.30. Nest in a\r\ncustard apple tree, 6 feet from the ground, built of twigs, lined with\r\nsmall vine stems and willow leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 204: White-tailed Kite.

MARSH HAWK. _Circus hudsonius._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, very abundant in all sections.\r\n\r\nThe adult of this species is very light colored, and young birds of the\r\nfirst two years have a reddish brown coloration; in both plumages the\r\nspecies is easily identified by the white patch on the rump. They are,\r\nalmost exclusively frequenters of fields and marshes, where they can\r\nmost often be seen, towards dusk, swooping in broad curves near the\r\nground, watching for field mice, which form the larger portion of their\r\ndiet. Their nests are made in swampy ground, often in the middle of a\r\nlarge marsh, being placed on the ground in the centre of a hummock or\r\nclump of grass; it is generally well lined with grasses and often\r\nrushes. They lay from four to seven pale bluish white eggs, generally\r\nunmarked; size 1.80 × 1.40.\r\n\r\n\r\n332. SHARP-SHINNED HAWK. _Accipiter velox._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, wintering in the United States and\r\nsouthward; breeds throughout its range, but most abundantly in northern\r\nUnited States and northward. This is one of the smallest of the hawks\r\nand in the adult plumage is a beautiful species, being barred below with\r\nlight brown, and having a bluish slate back. It is a very spirited and\r\ndaring bird and is one of the most destructive to small birds and young\r\nchickens. Its nest is a rude and sometimes very frail platform of twigs\r\nand leaves placed against the trunk of the tree at any height, but\r\naveraging, perhaps, fifteen feet. The eggs are bluish white, beautifully\r\nblotched and spotted with shades of brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 206: (Adult and young). Marsh Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Sharp-shinned Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 205\r\n\r\n333. COOPER'S HAWK. _Accipiter cooperi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of temperate North America, breeding throughout its range.\r\n\r\nAlthough larger (length 17 inches), the plumage of this species is\r\nalmost exactly the same as that of the preceding. Like the last, this is\r\nalso a destructive species. They construct their nests in the crotches\r\nof trees, generally at quite a height from the ground; the nest is made\r\nof sticks and twigs, and often lined with pieces of bark; occasionally\r\nan old Hawk's or Crow's nest is used by the birds. Their eggs are bluish\r\nwhite, unmarked or faintly spotted with pale brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n334. GOSHAWK. _Astur atricapillus atricapillus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, south in winter to the northern parts of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is one of the largest, strongest and most audacious of\r\nAmerican Hawks, frequently carrying off Grouse and poultry, the latter\r\noften in the presence of the owner. It is a handsome species in the\r\nadult plumage, with bluish gray upper parts, and light under parts,\r\nfinely vermiculated with grayish and black shafts to the feathers.\r\nLength 23 inches. Their nests are placed well up in the tallest trees,\r\nusually in dense woods, the nests being of sticks lined with weeds and\r\nbark. The three or four eggs are bluish white, generally unmarked, but\r\noccasionally with faint spots of brown. Size 2.30 x 1.70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 207: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Cooper's Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: American Goshawk.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 206\r\n\r\n[Illustration 208: Geo. L. Fordyce.\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF COOPER'S HAWK.]\r\n\r\nPage 207\r\n\r\n334a. WESTERN GOSHAWK. _Astur atricapillus striatulus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America from Alaska to California, breeding\r\nchiefly north of the United States except in some of the higher ranges\r\nof the Pacific coast. This sub-species is darker, both above and below,\r\nthan the American Goshawk. Its nesting habits and eggs are precisely the\r\nsame. The eggs are quite variable in size.\r\n\r\n\r\n335. HARRIS'S HAWK. _Parabuteo unicinctus harrisi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and Central America, north to the Mexican border of the\r\nUnited States; very abundant in southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis is a peculiar blackish species, with white rump, and chestnut\r\nshoulders and thighs. It is commonly met with in company with Caracaras,\r\nTurkey Buzzards and Black Vultures, feeding upon carrion. They also feed\r\nto an extent on small mammals and birds. Their nests are made of sticks,\r\ntwigs and weeds, and placed in bushes or low trees. The three or four\r\neggs are laid in April or May. They are dull white in color and\r\ngenerally unmarked, although often showing traces of pale brown spots.\r\nThey are quite variable in size, averaging 2.10 x 1.65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 209: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Harris's Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 208\r\n\r\n337. RED-TAILED HAWK. _Buteo borealis borealis_.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the handsomest of the larger hawks, and is the best known\r\nin the east, where it is commonly, but wrongly, designated as \"hen\r\nhawk\", a name, however, which is indiscriminately applied to any bird\r\nthat has talons and a hooked beak. The adult of this species is\r\nunmistakable because of its reddish brown tail; young birds are very\r\nfrequently confounded with other species. Their food consists chiefly of\r\nsmall rodents, snakes and lizards, and only occasionally are poultry or\r\nbirds taken. They nest in the tallest trees in large patches of woods,\r\nthe nests being made of sticks, weeds, leaves and trash. The eggs number\r\nfrom two to four, and are white, sometimes heavily, and sometimes\r\nsparingly, blotched and spotted with various shades of brown. Size 2.35\r\nx 1.80.\r\n\r\n\r\n337a. KRIDER'S HAWK. _Buteo borealis krideri_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains of the United States, north to Manitoba.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is described as lighter on the underparts, which are\r\nalmost immaculate. Its nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of\r\nthe preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n337b. WESTERN RED-TAIL. _Buteo borealis calurus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, chiefly west of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species varies from the plumage of the eastern Red-tail, to a\r\nnearly uniform sooty above and below, with the dark red tail crossed by\r\nseveral bands; it is a generally darker variety than the Red-tail. Its\r\nnesting habits are the same and the eggs show the great variations in\r\nmarkings that are common to the eastern bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 210: Red-tailed Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 209\r\n\r\n337d. HARLAN'S HAWK. _Buteo borealis harlani._\r\n\r\nRange.--Gulf States and southward, north to Kansas.\r\n\r\nThis dark sub-species is generally nearly uniform blackish, but\r\nsometimes is lighter or even white below. Its tail is rusty, mottled\r\nwith blackish and white. Its nesting habits are the same and the eggs\r\nare not distinguishable from those of the other Red-tails.\r\n\r\n\r\n339. RED-SHOULDERED HAWK. _Buteo lineatus lineatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains and from the southern parts of\r\nthe British Provinces southward; abundant and breeding throughout its\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nThis species is smaller than the Red-tailed and is not as powerfully\r\nbuilt; length 19 inches. The adults are handsomely barred beneath with\r\nreddish brown, giving the entire underparts a ruddy color. Like the last\r\nspecies, they rarely feed upon poultry, confining their diet chiefly to\r\nmice, rats, frogs, reptiles, etc. These Hawks nest in the larger growths\r\nof timber, usually building their nests high above the ground. The nest\r\nis of sticks, and lined with leaves, weeds and pieces of bark. They lay\r\nthree or four eggs with a white ground color, variously blotched and\r\nspotted, either sparingly or heavily, with different shades of brown.\r\nSize 2.15 × 1.75. Data.--Kalamazoo, Michigan, April 25, 1898. Nest about\r\n40 feet up in an oak tree; made of sticks and twigs and lined with bark.\r\nFour eggs. Collector, J. C. Holmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n339a. Florida Red-shouldered Hawk. _Buteo lineatus alleni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and the Gulf coast; north to South Carolina. The nesting\r\nhabits of this paler sub-species are precisely like those of the last\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 211: Red-shouldered Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 210\r\n\r\n[Illustration 212: Geo. L. Fordyce.\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.]\r\n\r\nPage 211\r\n\r\n339b. RED-BELLIED HAWK. _Buteo lineatus elegans._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from British Columbia south to Lower California,\r\nchiefly west of the Rockies.\r\n\r\nThis variety is similar to, but darker than lineatus, and the underparts\r\nare a uniform reddish brown, without barring. Their nests are like those\r\nof the Red-shouldered variety, and almost always placed high up in the\r\nlargest trees. The eggs are very similar, but average lighter in\r\nmarkings. Size 2.15 × 1.70. Data.--Diego, Cal., April 13, 1897. Nest in\r\na sycamore 20 feet from ground, made of sticks, leaves and feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n340. Zone-tailed Hawk. _Buteo abbreviatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and Central America, north to the Mexican border of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is 19 inches long, is wholly black with the\r\nexception of the tail, which is banded. Their nests are built in heavy\r\nwoods, and preferably in trees along the bank of a stream. The nest is\r\nof the usual Hawk construction and the two to four eggs are white,\r\nfaintly marked with pale chestnut. Data.--Marathon, Texas. Nest of\r\nsticks, lined with weeds and rabbit fur; on a horizontal branch of a\r\ncotton-wood tree, 30 feet up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 213: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 339b--340.]\r\n[Illustration: White,]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 212\r\n\r\n341. SENNETT'S WHITE-TAILED HAWK. _Buteo albicaudatus sennetti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican border of the United States and southward.\r\n\r\nA large, handsome Hawk which may be identified by its dark upper parts\r\nand white underparts and tail, the flanks and tail being lightly barred\r\nwith grayish; the shoulders are chestnut. It is especially abundant in\r\nthe southern parts of Texas, where it builds its nests of sticks and\r\nweeds, lined with grasses, leaves and moss. They nest in March and\r\nApril, laying two, or rarely three, eggs which are a dull white, and\r\ngenerally immaculate, but occasionally faintly or sparingly spotted with\r\nbrown. Size of eggs 2.25 × 1.80.\r\n\r\n\r\n342. SWAINSON'S HAWK. _Buteo swainsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Central and western North America, from the Mississippi Valley\r\nand Hudson Bay, to the Pacific coast, breeding throughout its range.\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of its range, this is the most abundant of the Hawk\r\nfamily. Its plumage is extremely variable, showing all the\r\nintergradations from a uniform sooty blackish to the typical adult\r\nplumage of a grayish above, and a white below, with a large breast patch\r\nof rich chestnut. Their nesting habits are as variable as their plumage.\r\nIn some localities, they nest exclusively in trees, in others\r\nindifferently upon the ground or rocky ledges. The nest is the usual\r\nHawk structure of sticks; the eggs are white, variously splashed and\r\nspotted with reddish brown and umber. Size 2.20 × 1.70. Data.--Stark\r\nCo., N. D., May 21, 1897. Nest of sticks, lined with weeds in an ash\r\ntree. Collector, Roy Dodd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 214: Sennett's White-tailed Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Swainson's Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin,]\r\n\r\nPage 213\r\n\r\n343. BROAD-WINGED HAWK. _Buteo platypterus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains, and from the British\r\nProvinces southward.\r\n\r\nA medium sized species, about 16 inches in length, and with a short tail\r\nand broad rounded wings; adults have the underparts handsomely barred\r\nwith brown. Their nests are usually built in large trees, but generally\r\nplaced against the trunk in the crotch of some of the lower branches. It\r\nis made of sticks and almost invariably lined with bark. The two to four\r\neggs are of a grayish white color, marked with chestnut, brown and stone\r\ngray; size 1.90 × 1.55. Data.--Worcester, Mass., May 16, 1895. Nest\r\nabout 20 feet up in a large chestnut tree. The birds continually circled\r\noverhead, their weird cries sounding like the creaking of branches.\r\nCollector, A. J. White.\r\n\r\n\r\n344. SHORT-TAILED HAWK. _Buteo brachyurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--A tropical species, which occurs north to the Mexican border and\r\nregularly to southern Florida, where it breeds in the large cypress\r\nswamps. Its eggs are pale greenish white, sparingly spotted with brown,\r\nchiefly at the large end. Size 2.15 × 1.60.\r\n\r\n\r\n345. MEXICAN BLACK HAWK. _Urubitinga anthracina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican border of the United States and southward.\r\n\r\nA coal black species about 22 inches in length, distinguished by the\r\nwhite tip, and broad white band across the tail about midway. This is\r\none of the least abundant of the Mexican species that cross the border.\r\nThey are shy birds and build their nests in the tallest trees in remote\r\nwoods. Their two or three eggs are grayish white, faintly spotted with\r\npale brown; size 2.25 × 1.80. Data.--Los Angeles County, Cal., April 6,\r\n1889. Nest of sticks, lined with bark and leaves; 45 feet up in a\r\nsycamore tree. Collector, R. B. Chapman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 215: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: American Rough-legged Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 214\r\n\r\n346. MEXICAN GOSHAWK. _Asturina plagiata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north to the border of the United States.\r\n\r\nA beautiful, medium sized Hawk (17 inches long), slaty gray above, white\r\nbelow, numerously barred with grayish; tail black, crossed by several\r\nwhite bars. These are graceful and active birds, feeding largely upon\r\nsmall rodents, and occasionally small birds. They nest in the top of\r\ntall trees, laying two or three greenish white, unmarked eggs; size 1.95\r\nx 1.60. Data.--Santa Cruz River, Arizona, June 3, 1902. Nest in the fork\r\nof a mesquite tree about forty feet from the ground; made of large\r\nsticks, lined with smaller ones and leaves. Three eggs. Collector, O. W.\r\nHoward.\r\n\r\n\r\n347a. ROUGH-LEGGED HAWK. _Archibuteo lagopus sancti-johannis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, breeding chiefly north of our borders\r\nand wintering south to the middle portions of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Rough-legs are large, heavily built birds of prey, specially\r\ncharacterized by the completely feathered legs. The present species is\r\n22 inches long, and in the normal plumage has a whitish head, neck,\r\nbreast and tail, the former being streaked and the latter barred with\r\nblackish; the remainder of the upper and underparts are blackish brown.\r\nTheir nests are usually placed in trees, and less often on the ground\r\nthan those of the next species. These Rough-legs are very irregularly\r\ndistributed, and are nowhere as common as the next. While the greater\r\nnumber nest north of the United States, it is very probable that a great\r\nmany nest on the higher ranges within our borders. The species is often\r\ntaken in summer, even in Massachusetts. They lay three eggs of a bluish\r\nwhite color, boldly splashed with dark brown; size 2.25 x 1.75.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 216: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Rough-legged Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 215\r\n\r\n348. FERRUGINOUS ROUGH-LEG. _Archibuteo ferrugineus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, west of the Mississippi, breeding from the\r\nlatitude of Colorado north to the Saskatchewan region.\r\n\r\nThis species nests very abundantly along our northern states,\r\nparticularly in Dakota. It is a larger bird than the preceding and can\r\neasily be told by its reddish coloration, particularly on the shoulders\r\nand tibia. While in some localities they nest only in trees, the greater\r\nnumber appear to build their nests on the ground or rocky ledges, making\r\na large heap of sticks, weeds and grass. Their three or four eggs are\r\nwhite, beautifully spotted and blotched, in endless variety, with\r\nvarious shades of brown. Size 2.60 x 2.00. Data.--Stark Co., N. D.,\r\nApril 29, 1900. Nest built of coarse sticks on a clay butte.\r\n\r\n\r\n349. GOLDEN EAGLE. _Aquila chrysætos._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, west of the Mississippi; most abundant in the\r\nRockies and along the Pacific coast ranges.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent bird, which is even more powerful than the Bald Eagle,\r\nmeasures about 34 inches long, and spreads about 7 feet. Its plumage is\r\na rich brownish black, very old birds being golden brown on the nape.\r\nThey can be distinguished in all plumages from the Bald Eagle by the\r\ncompletely feathered tarsus. They build their nests in the tops of the\r\ntallest trees in the wild, mountainous country of the west, and more\r\nrarely upon ledges of the cliffs. The nests are made of large sticks,\r\nlined with smaller ones and leaves and weeds. Their eggs are the most\r\nhandsome of the Raptores, being white in color, and blotched, splashed,\r\nspotted and specked with light brown and clouded with gray or lilac, of\r\ncourse varying endlessly in pattern and intensity. Size 2.90 x 2.50.\r\nData.--Monterey Co., Cal., May 3, 1888. Three eggs. Nest of sticks,\r\nlined with pine needles, in a pine tree, 50 feet up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 217: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Rough-legged Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Golden Eagle.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 216\r\n\r\n[Illustration 218: BALD EAGLE.]\r\n\r\nPage 217\r\n\r\n351. GRAY SEA EAGLE. _Haliæetus albicilla._\r\n\r\nA common species on the sea coasts of Europe; straggling to southern\r\nGreenland, where it nests upon the rocky cliffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n352. BALD EAGLE. _Haliæetus leucocephalus leucocephalus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America; most abundant on the Atlantic coast;\r\nbreeds throughout its range. This large white-headed and white-tailed\r\nspecies is abundant in sufficiently wild localities along the Atlantic\r\ncoast. It only attains the white head and tail when three years old, the\r\nfirst two years, being blackish. It is about 34 inches in length and\r\nexpands about seven feet, never over eight feet, and only birds of the\r\nsecond year (when they are larger than the adults) ever approach this\r\nexpanse. Their food consists of fish (which they sometimes capture\r\nthemselves, but more often take from the Osprey), carrion, and Ducks,\r\nwhich they catch in flight. Their nests are massive structures of\r\nsticks, in the tops of tall trees. They very rarely lay more than two\r\neggs, which are white. Size 2.75 x 2.10. Data.--Mt. Pleasant, S. C.,\r\nnest in top of a pine, 105 feet from the ground; made of large sticks\r\nand lined with Spanish moss.\r\n\r\n\r\n352a. NORTHERN BALD EAGLE.--_Haliæetus leucocephalus alascanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Alaska. This sub-species averages slightly larger than the Bald\r\nEagle, but never exceeds the largest dimensions of that species. Its\r\nnesting habits and eggs are the same, except that it more often builds\r\nits nests on rocky cliffs than does the Bald Eagle. The eggs are laid in\r\nFebruary and March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 219: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Bald Eagle.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 218\r\n\r\nFALCONS AND CARACARAS\r\n\r\nFamily FALCONDIDAE\r\n\r\n353. WHITE GYRFALCON. _Falco islandus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions; south in winter casually to northern United\r\nStates, chiefly on the coast.\r\n\r\nGyrfalcons are large, strong, active and fearless birds, about 23 inches\r\nin length. Their food consists chiefly of hares, Ducks and Waders which\r\nabound in the far north. The present species is snowy white, more or\r\nless barred with blackish brown on the back and wings and with a few\r\nmarks on the breast. They nest upon the ledges of high cliffs, laying\r\nthree or four eggs of a buffy color, blotched and finely specked with\r\nreddish brown, this color often concealing the ground color. Size of\r\neggs, 2.30 × 1.80. In America, they nest in Greenland and the Arctic\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n\r\n354. GRAY GYRFALCON. _Falco rusticolus rusticolus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions; south in winter to northern United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is of the size of the last but the plumage is largely gray,\r\nbarred with dusky. They nest more abundantly in southern Greenland than\r\ndo the preceding species. The nesting habits and eggs do not differ.\r\n\r\n\r\n354a. Gyrfalcon. _Falco rusticolus gyrfalco._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions; south casually to Long Island.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is hardly to be distinguished from the preceding; its\r\nnesting habits and eggs are identical, the nests being of sticks, lined\r\nwith weeds and feathers and placed upon the most inaccessible ledges of\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 220: Gray Gyrfalcon. White Gyrfalcon.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 219\r\n\r\n354b. BLACK GYRFALCON. _Falco rusticolus obsoletus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Labrador; south casually, in winter, to Long Island.\r\n\r\nA slightly darker variety. Eggs indistinguishable. Data.--Ungava coast,\r\nLabrador, May 25, 1900. Nest a heap of seaweed and feathers on sea\r\ncliff, containing three eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n355. PRAIRIE FALCON. _Falcon mexicanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Mississippi, and from Dakota and\r\nWashington southward to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species abounds in suitable localities, generally placing its nests\r\nupon rocky ledges and cliffs, and sometimes trees, generally upon the\r\nbanks of some stream. The nests are masses of sticks, lined with weeds\r\nand grasses. The three or four eggs have a reddish buff ground color,\r\nand are thickly sprinkled and blotched with reddish buff brown and\r\nchestnut; size 2.05 × 1.60.\r\n\r\n356a. Duck Hawk. _Falco peregrinus anatum._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding locally, chiefly in mountainous\r\nregions, throughout its range.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful species, characterized by its black moustache, is the\r\nmost graceful, fearless, and swiftest of the Falcons, striking down\r\nbirds of several times its own weight, such as some of the larger Ducks.\r\nIt breeds quite abundantly on the Pacific coast and in certain\r\nlocalities in the Dakotas, laying its eggs on the rocky ledges. Their\r\neggs are similar to those of the Prairie Falcon, but are darker and\r\nbrighter, in fact they are the darkest, brightest marked, and most\r\nbeautiful of Falcon eggs; size 2.05 × 1.55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 221: Reddish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Prairie Falcon.]\r\n[Illustration: Duck Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff or reddish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 220\r\n\r\n356b. PEALE'S FALCON. _Falco peregrinus pealei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from northern United States north to Alaska.\r\n\r\nA darker form of the preceding, such as occurs in this section with a\r\ngreat many other birds. The nesting habits and the eggs are precisely\r\nlike those of the Duck Hawk.\r\n\r\n\r\n357. Pigeon Hawk. _Falco columbarius columbarius._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding chiefly north of the United States\r\nexcept in some of the higher ranges along our northern border. A small\r\nFalcon, about 11 inches long, often confused with the Sharp-shinned\r\nHawk, but much darker and a more stoutly built bird. It is a daring\r\nspecies, often attacking birds larger than itself; it also feeds on\r\nmice, grasshoppers, squirrels, etc. They generally build a nest of\r\nsticks in trees, deep in the woods; less often in natural cavities of\r\ndead trees; and sometimes on rocky ledges. Their four or five eggs have\r\na brownish buff ground color, heavily blotched with brown and chestnut.\r\nSize 1.50 × 1.22.\r\n\r\n\r\n357a. BLACK PIGEON HAWK. _Falco columbarius suckleyi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from northern United States north to Alaska.\r\n\r\nVery similar in appearance to the preceding, but much darker, both above\r\nand below. Its nesting habits and eggs will not differ in any manner\r\nfrom those of the Pigeon Hawk.\r\n\r\n\r\n357b. RICHARDSON'S PIGEON HAWK. _Falco columbarius richardsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of North America from the Mississippi to the Rockies\r\nand from Mexico to the Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the Pigeon Hawk, but is paler both above and\r\nbelow, and the tail bars are more numerous and white. Their nesting\r\nhabits are the same as those of the preceding species, they either\r\nbuilding in hollow trees, or making a rude nest of sticks and twigs in\r\nthe tops of trees. The eggs have a creamy ground and are sprinkled with\r\ndots and blotches of various shades of brown. Size 1.60 × 1.23. The egg\r\nfigured is one of a beautiful set of four in the collection of Mr. C. W.\r\nCrandall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 222: Brownish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Pigeon Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Richardson's Pigeon Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 221\r\n\r\n358.1 MERLIN. _Falco æsalon._\r\n\r\nThis common European species was once accidentally taken in southern\r\nGreenland. Their eggs are generally laid on the ground on cliffs or\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n359. APLOMADO FALCON. _Falco fusco-cærulescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Tropical America north to Mexican boundary of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis handsome and strikingly marked Falcon is found in limited numbers\r\nwithin the United States, but south is common and widely distributed.\r\nThey nest at a low elevation, in bushes or small trees, making their\r\nrude nests of twigs, lined with a few grasses. They lay three, and\r\nsometimes four, eggs which have a creamy white ground color, finely\r\ndotted with cinnamon, and with heavy blotches of brown. Size 1.75 ×\r\n1.30.\r\n\r\n\r\n359.1. KESTREL. _Falco tinnunculus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of Europe; accidental on the coast of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThis species is very similar in size and coloration to the American\r\nSparrow Hawk. They are much more abundant than the Sparrow Hawk is in\r\nthis country and frequently nest about houses, in hollow trees, on\r\nrafters of barns, or on ledges and embankments. Their eggs are of a\r\nreddish buff color, speckled and blotched with reddish brown, they being\r\nmuch darker than those of the American Sparrow Hawk.\r\n\r\n\r\n360a. Desert Sparrow Hawk. _Falco sparverius phalæna._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from British Columbia south to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis variety is slightly larger and paler than the eastern form. There\r\nare no differences in the identification of the two varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 223: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Aplomado Falcon. Desert Sparrow Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Reddish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 222\r\n\r\n360. SPARROW HAWK. _Falco sparverius._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Rocky Mountains and north to Hudson\r\nBay; winters from the middle portions of the United States, southward.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful little Falcon is the smallest of the American Hawks,\r\nbeing only 10 inches in length. They are very abundant in the east,\r\nnesting anywhere in cavities in trees, either in woods or open fields.\r\nThe eggs are generally deposited upon the bottom of the cavity with no\r\nlining; they are creamy or yellowish buff in color, sprinkled, spotted\r\nor blotched in endless variety, with reddish brown. Size 1.35 × 1.10.\r\nThese birds are very noisy, especially when the young are learning to\r\nfly, uttering a loud, tinkling, \"killy, killy, killy.\" They have a very\r\namiable disposition, and frequently nest harmoniously in the same tree\r\nwith other birds, such as Flickers and Robins.\r\n\r\n\r\n360b. ST. LUCAS SPARROW HAWK. _Falco sparverius peninsularis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis variety is smaller than the eastern, and even paler than the\r\nwestern form. Eggs identical with eastern specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n361. CUBAN SPARROW HAWK. _Falco sparveroides._\r\n\r\nA darker colored West Indian form, whose habits and nesting do not vary\r\nfrom those of the common Sparrow Hawk; casually taken in Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 224: Buffy.]\r\n[Illustration: Sparrow Hawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Egg of Golden Eagle.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 223\r\n\r\n[Illustration 225: SPARROW HAWK.]\r\n\r\nPage 224\r\n\r\n362. Audubon Caracara. _Polyborus cheriway._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern border of the United States south to South America.\r\n\r\nA strikingly marked blackish and whitish species, much barred on the\r\nfore back and the breast, with the head and throat largely white, except\r\nfor a black and somewhat crested crown. They are numerous in southern\r\nTexas and also in the interior of southern Florida, where they are\r\nresident. They build bulky, but shabby nests of sticks, weeds and grass,\r\npiled into a promiscuous heap, generally located in bushes or low trees.\r\nTheir two or three eggs have a ground color varying from buff to bright\r\ncinnamon, and are dotted and blotched with all shades of brown and\r\number. On the whole, these eggs show a greater diversity of markings and\r\nground color than those of any other species. Size 2.50 × 1.80.\r\n\r\n\r\n363. GUADALUPE CARACARA. _Polyborus lutosus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Guadalupe Island and others off Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis species is somewhat like the preceding, but the plumage is duller,\r\nand the coloration more uniform. Their nesting habits and eggs do not\r\nvary essentially from those of Audubon Caracara. Mr. John Lewis Childs\r\nhas a set of two eggs taken June 8, 1896, on Santa Anita Island, by\r\nCoolidge and Miller. The nest was made of sticks and situated in a giant\r\ncactus. The eggs are slightly brighter and more clearly marked than any\r\nof cheriway that I have ever seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 226: Audubon's Caracara.]\r\n[Illustration: Cinnamon.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 225\r\n\r\nOSPREY. Family Pandionidae\r\n\r\n364. OSPREY. _Pandion haliætus carolinensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of temperate America from the Arctic circle south to the\r\nequator, most abundant along the sea coasts.\r\n\r\nReal old birds have the head whiter, and less white edging to the back\r\nfeathers, than do the young. Feet very strong, and very hard and rough,\r\nperfectly adapted to grasping slippery fish; outer toe can be used\r\nequally as well, either in front or behind, when perching or grasping\r\ntheir prey.\r\n\r\nProbably this great fisherman is as well known from one end of the\r\ncountry to the other as any of our wild birds. He is protected by law in\r\na great many states and by custom in nearly all localities where they\r\nbreed. It is one of the pleasantest sights along the coast to watch a\r\nnumber of these great birds as they soar at an elevation above the\r\nwater, watching for fish to come near the surface, when, with folded\r\nwings, the bird speeds downward and plunges into the water, rarely\r\nmissing his prey. In many localities they are very tame and nest in the\r\nvicinity of houses, sometimes even in the yard. Their nests are\r\nplatforms of sticks, which, being used year after year and constantly\r\nadded to, become of enormous proportions. They lay two or three eggs of\r\na bright creamy color, handsomely blotched with bright chestnut brown.\r\nThey show a great diversity of size as well as markings, but average\r\n2.40 × 1.80.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 227: American Osprey.]\r\n[Illustration.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 226\r\n\r\n[Illustration 228: C.

BARN OWL. _Aluco pratincola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Chiefly in the southern parts of the United States; north\r\ncasually to Massachusetts, Minnesota and Washington.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the lightest colored of the Owls; it has a long,\r\npeculiarly hooded face, from which it gets the name of \"Monkey-faced\r\nOwl.\" Its plumage is yellowish buff, specked and barred lightly with\r\nblackish.\r\n\r\nIt nests usually in hollow cavities of trees, but appears to have no\r\nobjections to barns, holes in banks, or anywhere it can find a concealed\r\ncrevice in which to deposit its four to six pure white eggs; size 1.70 ×\r\n1.30.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORNED OWL. Family Strigidae\r\n\r\n366. LONG-EARED OWL. _Asio wilsonianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from the southern parts of British\r\nAmerica, southward.\r\n\r\nThis species is 15 inches in length; it can easily be separated from any\r\nother species by its long ear tufts, brownish face, and barred\r\nunderparts. Their food consists almost entirely of small rodents, which\r\nthey catch at night. Most of their nests are found in trees, they\r\ngenerally using old Crow's or Hawk's nests. They also, in some\r\nlocalities, nest in hollow trees, or in crevices among rocks. They lay\r\nfrom four to seven pure white eggs; size 1.55 × 1.35.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 229: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Barn Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: Long-eared Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 228\r\n\r\n[Illustration 230: L. S. Horton.\r\nLONG-EARED OWL ON NEST.]\r\n\r\nPage 229\r\n\r\n367. SHORT-EARED OWL. _Asio flammeus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding from the middle portions of the\r\nUnited States northward, and wintering in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is of the size of the last, but is paler, has very short\r\near tufts, and is streaked beneath. Its habits are the same except that\r\nit frequently hunts, over the marshes and meadows, on dark days and\r\ntowards dusk.\r\n\r\nTheir four to seven pure white eggs are laid upon the ground in marshy\r\nplaces, sometimes upon a lining of sticks and weeds, and are generally\r\nunder a bush, or close to an old log. Size of eggs 1.55 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n368. BARRED OWL. _Strix varia varia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, from the British Provinces, southward;\r\nwest to the Rockies.\r\n\r\nThis species is the most common of the large owls, and can be\r\ndistinguished by its mottled and barred gray and white plumage, and lack\r\nof ear tufts; length 20 inches. It is the bird commonly meant by the\r\nterm \"hoot owl\", and being strictly nocturnal, is rarely seen flying in\r\nthe day time, unless disturbed from its roosting place in the deep\r\nwoods. Its food consists chiefly of rats, mice and frogs, and sometimes,\r\nbut not often, poultry. It nests in the heart of large woods, generally\r\nin hollows of large trees, and less often in deserted Crow's nests. They\r\nlay from two to four pure white eggs, averaging considerably smaller\r\nthan those of the Great Horned Owl; size 1.95 × 1.65.\r\n\r\n\r\n368a. FLORIDA BARRED OWL. _Strix varia alleni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and the Gulf States; north to South Carolina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 231: Short-eared Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Barred Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 230\r\n\r\n[Illustration 232: Chas.

TEXAS BARRED OWL. _Strix varia albogilva._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Texas.\r\n\r\nA very similar but slightly paler variety than the Barred Owl, and with\r\nthe toes bare, as in _alleni._ Eggs indistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n369. SPOTTED OWL. _Strix occidentalis occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, from southern Oregon and Colorado,\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Barred Owl, but spotted, instead of barred, on the back\r\nof head and neck, and much more extensively barred on the under parts.\r\nThe nesting habits do not appear to differ in any respect from those of\r\nthe eastern Barred Owl, and their eggs, which are from two to four in\r\nnumber, can not be distinguished from those of the latter species; size\r\n2.05 × 1.80.\r\n\r\n\r\n369a. NORTHERN SPOTTED Owl. _Strix occidentalis caurina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern United States and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the preceding, but darker, both above and below; nesting the\r\nsame, in hollow trees or in old Hawk's or Crow's nests. Eggs not\r\ndistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n370. Great Gray Owl. _Scotiaptex nebulosa._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America; wintering regularly south to the\r\nnorthern border of the United States and casually farther.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest of American Owls, being about 26 inches in length;\r\nit does not weigh nearly as much, however, as the Great Horned or Snowy\r\nOwls, its plumage being very light and fluffy, and dark gray in color,\r\nmottled with white. The facial disc is very large, and the eyes are\r\nsmall and yellow, while those of the Barred Owl are large and blue\r\nblack. They nest in heavily wooded districts, building their nests of\r\nsticks, chiefly in pine trees. The two to four white eggs are laid\r\nduring May and June; size 2.15 × 1.70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 233: Great Gray Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 232\r\n\r\n370a. LAPP OWL. _Scotiaptex nebulosa lapponica._\r\n\r\nA paler form of the Great Gray Owl, inhabiting the Arctic regions of the\r\nOld World; accidental on the coast of Alaska. Their nesting habits and\r\neggs do not differ from those of the American bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n371. RICHARDSON'S OWL. _Cryptoglaux funerea richardsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, breeding north of the United States;\r\nwinters south to our border and casually farther.\r\n\r\nThis is a dark grayish and white bird, 10 inches in length, and without\r\near tufts. Breeds commonly in the extensively wooded districts of\r\nBritish America, chiefly in the northern parts. Their three or four\r\nwhite eggs are usually at the bottom of a cavity in a tree, but\r\noccasionally the birds build a rude nest of sticks and twigs, lined with\r\nleaves and placed in trees at a moderate height from the ground. Size of\r\neggs, 1.25 × 1.05.\r\n\r\n\r\n372. SAW-WHET OWL; ACADIAN OWL. _Cryptoglaux acadica acadica._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding in the northern parts of the United\r\nStates and in British America, and south in the Rockies to Mexico;\r\nwinters south to the middle portions of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis small species (length 8 inches) is marked very similarly to the\r\npreceding, but the plumage is brown instead of gray. They normally nest\r\nin hollow trees, generally in deserted Woodpecker holes, in extensively\r\nwooded sections, and usually in mountainous country, especially in the\r\nUnited States. They have also been known to nest in bird boxes near farm\r\nhouses and in old Crow's nests. During April or May, they lay from three\r\nto six white eggs. Size 1.20 × 1.00. They are quiet and chiefly\r\nnocturnal birds, not often seen, and may be found nesting in any of the\r\nnorthern states.\r\n\r\n\r\n372a. NORTHWESTERN SAW-WHET OWL. _Cryptoglaux acadica scotiæa._\r\n\r\nRange.--A dark variety found on the coast of British Columbia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 234: Richardson's Owl. Saw-whet Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 233\r\n\r\n373. SCREECH OWL. _Otus asio asio._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the plains and from the southern British\r\nProvinces to Florida.\r\n\r\nThis well known species, which is often called \"Little Horned Owl\"\r\nbecause of its ear tufts is found either in the type form of some of its\r\nvarieties in all parts of the United States. They have two color phases,\r\nthe plumage being either a yellowish brown or gray, and black and white;\r\nthese color phases are not dependent upon sex or locality, as often\r\nyoung or both phases are found in the same nest; the gray phase is the\r\nmost abundant. They nest anywhere in hollow trees, being found very\r\nfrequently in decayed stubs of apple trees. They also often nest in\r\nbarns or other old buildings which are not frequented too freely. Their\r\nfood consists chiefly of mice and meadow moles, with occasionally small\r\nbirds. During April or May they lay their white eggs, the full\r\ncomplement of which is from five to eight. Size 1.35 × 1.20. The nesting\r\nhabits of all the sub-species, as far as we can learn, are exactly like\r\nthose of the eastern Screech Owl; the eggs cannot be distinguished, and\r\nin most cases, even the birds cannot be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n373a. FLORIDA SCREECH OWL. _Otus asio floridanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf coasts.\r\n\r\nSlightly smaller and darker than asio. The eggs average slightly\r\nsmaller. Size 1.30 × 1.15.\r\n\r\n\r\n373b. Texas Screech Owl. _Otus asio mccalli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Texas, and southward into Mexico. Very similar to floridanus.\r\n\r\n373c. CALIFORNIA SCREECH OWL. _Otus asio bendirei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of California and Oregon. Size of, but darker than asio.\r\n\r\n\r\n373d. KENNICOTT'S SCREECH OWL. _Otus asio kennicotti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Oregon to Alaska. This is the darkest of the\r\nScreech Owls and averages a trifle larger than the eastern form.\r\n\r\n\r\n373e. ROCKY MOUNTAIN SCREECH OWL. _Otus asio maxwelliæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Foothills of the Rockies, from Colorado to Montana. This is the\r\npalest form of the Screech Owl. Of the same size as the last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 235: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Screech Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 234\r\n\r\n373f. Mexican Screech Owl. _Otus asio cineraceus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico and southwestern border of the United States. A\r\ngray form with little or no buff, and more numerously barred below.\r\n\r\n\r\n373g. AIKEN'S SCREECH Owl. _Otus asio aikeni._\r\n\r\nRange.--El Paso County, Colorado. A gray form, with the dark markings\r\ncoarser and more numerous than in any other.\r\n\r\n373h. MACFARLANE'S SCREECH OWL. _Otus asio macfarlanei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern border of the United States from Washington to Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\n373.1. Spotted Screech Owl. _Otus trichopsis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of southern Arizona, south into Mexico.\r\n\r\nA grayish species, similar to asio, but paler and more finely barred\r\nbeneath, and with whitish spots on the feathers of the foreback. The\r\nnesting habits and eggs are probably the same as those of the Screech\r\nOwl.\r\n\r\n\r\n373.2. XANTUS'S SCREECH OWL. _Otus xantusi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nA grayish species with the back and underparts finely vermiculated with\r\nreddish brown, and with streaks of darker. It is not likely that the\r\nhabits or eggs of this species will be found to differ from those of the\r\nScreech Owl.\r\n\r\n\r\n374. FLAMMULATED SCREECH OWL. _Otus flammeolus flammeolus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountain ranges of Mexico, north to Colorado and west to\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThis species is smaller than asio, has shorter ear tufts, the plumage is\r\nmuch streaked and edged with rusty, and the toes are unfeathered to\r\ntheir base. They nest in hollow trees, generally using deserted\r\nWoodpecker holes. Their three or four eggs are white. Size 1.15 × .95.\r\nThis species is uncommon in all parts of its range.\r\n\r\n\r\n374a. DWARF SCREECH OWL. _Otus flammeolus idahœnsis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Local in Idaho, eastern Washington and California.\r\n\r\nThis rare variety is smaller than the preceding and is considerably\r\npaler. Its eggs have not been described, but should be a trifle smaller\r\nthan the last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 236: 374--375a.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 235\r\n\r\n375. GREAT HORNED OWL. _Bubo virginianus virginianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains and north to Labrador.\r\n\r\nThis species and its varieties are the only large Owls having\r\nconspicuous ear tufts. They are about 22 inches in length, and have a\r\nmottled brown, black and white plumage, barred below. This is also one\r\nof the \"Hoot Owls,\" but is not nearly as abundant as the Barred Owl. It\r\nis one of the strongest of the family, and captures rabbits, grouse and\r\npoultry, and is very often found to have been feeding upon, or to have\r\nbeen in the immediate vicinity of a skunk. They nest very early,\r\nJanuary, February and March. Deserted Hawk's or Crow's nests are very\r\nfrequently used by this bird, if they are located in dense woods. They\r\nalso sometimes nest in hollow cavities in large trees. They lay from two\r\nto four pure white eggs. Size 2.25 × 1.85.\r\n\r\n\r\n375a. Western Horned Owl. _Bubo virginianus pallescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, except the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nA smaller and lighter colored form of the preceding, having the same\r\nhabits and the eggs being indistinguishable from those of the eastern\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n\r\n375b. ARCTIC HORNED OWL. _Bubo virginianus subarcticus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of Arctic America from Hudson Bay to Alaska; south in\r\nwinter to the northwestern tier of states.\r\n\r\nA very pale colored Horned Owl with little or no buff or brownish in the\r\nplumage, some specimens (very rare) being pure white with only a few\r\nblack bars on the back. Their nesting habits are the same and the eggs\r\ndo not vary appreciably from those of the eastern Horned Owl.\r\n\r\n375c. DUSKY HORNED OWL. _Bubo virginianus saturatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from California to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis is the darkest of the Horned Owls, the extreme case being nearly\r\nblack on the back and very dark below. Nesting the same as the Great\r\nHorned Owl.\r\n\r\n\r\n375d. PACIFIC HORNED OWL. _Bubo virginianus pacificus._\r\n\r\nRange.--California, southward and east to Arizona.\r\n\r\nSmaller and darker than the eastern form but not as dark as the last.\r\nEggs the same as those of the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 237: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Great Horned Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 236\r\n\r\n[Illustration 238: YOUNG SCREECH OWLS.]\r\n\r\nPage 237\r\n\r\n375e. DWARF HORNED OWL. _Bubo virginianus elachistus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis is a similar but darker form of the Horned Owl and is very much\r\nsmaller than virginianus. The nesting habits will be the same, but the\r\neggs may average smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n376. Snowy Owl. _Nyctea nyctea._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions, breeding within the Arctic Circle and wintering\r\nto the northern border of the United States and casually farther.\r\n\r\nThis very beautiful species varies in plumage from pure white, unmarked,\r\nto specimens heavily and broadly barred with blackish brown. It is, next\r\nto the Great Gray Owl, the largest species found in America, being 2\r\nfeet in length. Like the Great Horned Owls, they are very strong,\r\nfearless, and rapacious birds, feeding upon hares, squirrels and smaller\r\nmammals, as well as Grouse, Ptarmigan, etc. They nest upon the ground,\r\non banks or mossy hummocks on the dry portions of marshes, laying from\r\ntwo to eight eggs, white in color and with a smoother shell than those\r\nof the Great Horned Owl. Size 2.25 × 1.75. Data.--Point Barrow, Alaska,\r\nJune 16, 1898. Three eggs laid in a hollow in the moss.\r\n\r\n\r\n377. European Hawk Owl. _Surnia ulula ulula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern portion of the Old World; accidental in Alaska.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the American species, but lighter and more brownish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 239: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Snowy Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 238\r\n\r\n377a. HAWK OWL. _Surnia ulula caparoch._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, breeding from the central portions of\r\nBritish America northward; probably also breeds in the Rocky Mountains\r\nin the northern tier of states and casually farther.\r\n\r\nThis handsome mottled and barred, gray and black Owl might readily be\r\nmistaken for a Hawk, because of his Hawk-like appearance and long\r\nrounded tail. They are very active birds, especially in the day time,\r\nfor they are more diurnal than nocturnal; their food is mostly of small\r\nrodents, and also small birds. They nest either in the tops of large fir\r\ntrees, in hollows of stumps, or, in some cases, upon the ground. When in\r\ntrees their nests are made of twigs, leaves and weeds, and sometimes\r\nlined with moss and feathers; they lay from three to eight white eggs,\r\nsize 1.50 × 1.20. Data.--Labrador, May 3, 1899. Five eggs. Nest in the\r\ntop of a dead tree, 15 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n378. BURROWING OWL. _Speotyto cunicularia hypogæa._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America from the Mississippi Valley west to\r\nCalifornia; north to the southern parts of British America and south to\r\nCentral America.\r\n\r\nThese peculiar birds are wholly different in plumage, form and habits\r\nfrom any other American Owls. They can readily be recognized by their\r\nlong, slender and scantily feathered legs. Their plumage is brownish,\r\nspotted with white above, and white, barred with brown below; length 10\r\ninches. They nest, generally in large communities in burrows in the\r\nground, usually deserted Prairie Dog holes. While generally but a single\r\npair occupy one burrow, as many as twenty have been found nesting\r\ntogether. Sometimes the burrows are unlined, and again may have a carpet\r\nof grasses and feathers. Their white eggs generally number from six to\r\nten; size 1.25 × 1.00. Data.--Sterling, Kans., May 7, 1899. Nest of bits\r\nof dry dung at the end of a deserted Prairie Dog burrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 240: American Hawk Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 239\r\n\r\n378a. FLORIDA BURROWING OWL. _Speotyto cunicularia floridana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Local in the interior of Florida.\r\n\r\nLike the last, but slightly smaller and paler, and with the tarsus less\r\nfeathered. Their habits or eggs do not differ from the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n379. PYGMY OWL. _Glaucidium gnoma gnoma._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region and westward; from British Columbia\r\nsouthward. These interesting little Owls, which are but seven inches in\r\nlength, feed in the day time upon insects, mice and, occasionally, small\r\nbirds. They frequent extensively wooded districts, chiefly in the\r\nmountain ranges. They nest in tall trees, generally in deserted\r\nWoodpeckers' holes, laying three or four white eggs during May; size\r\nabout 1.00 × .90.\r\n\r\n\r\n379a. California Pygmy Owl. _Glaucidium gnoma californicum._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from British Columbia, south through California.\r\nThis sub-species is darker and more brownish than the last. It is not an\r\nuncommon bird in California. They nest in the tallest trees along the\r\nranges, often being found 75 or more feet from the ground. The eggs do\r\nnot differ from those of the Pygmy Owl, ranging in size from 1.00 × .85\r\nto 1.20 × .95.\r\n\r\n\r\n379.1. HOSKIN'S PYGMY OWL. _Glaucidium hoskinsi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis species is smaller and more gray than the preceding. It is not\r\nprobable that its manners of nesting or eggs differ in any respect from\r\nthose of the others of this genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 241: Burrowing Owl.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 240\r\n\r\n380. FERRUGINOUS PYGMY OWL. _Glaucidium phalœnoides._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and Central America; north to the Mexican border of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis species is of the same size as the last, but is much tinged with\r\nrufous on the upper parts, and the tail is of a bright chestnut brown\r\ncolor, crossed by about eight bars of black. They nest in hollow\r\ncavities in trees, from ten to forty feet from the ground, laying three\r\nor four glossy white eggs; size 1.10 × .90.\r\n\r\n\r\n381. ELF OWL. _Micropallas whitneyi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north to the bordering states.\r\n\r\nThis odd little bird is the smallest member of the family found in\r\nAmerica, attaining a length of only six inches. In plumage it may be\r\ndescribed as similar to a very small, earless Screech Owl, only with the\r\npattern of the markings a great deal finer. They are said to be quite\r\nabundant in the table lands of central Mexico and in southern Arizona,\r\nwhere they build their nests in deserted Woodpeckers' holes, perhaps\r\nmost frequently in the giant cactus. It is said to be more nocturnal\r\nthan the Pygmy Owls and to feed almost exclusively upon insects. They\r\nlay from three to five eggs having a slight gloss. Size 1.02 × .90.\r\nData.--Southern Arizona, May 22, 1902. Nest in a deserted Woodpecker\r\nhole. Two eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 242: 380--381.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco-photo.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 241\r\n\r\nPAROQUETS AND PARROTS. Order XIII. PSITTACI.\r\n\r\nFamily PSITTACIDAE\r\n\r\n382. CAROLINA PAROQUET. _Conuropsis carolinensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Now rare in Florida and along the Gulf coast to Indian\r\nTerritory. As late as 1885, the Carolina Paroquets were abundant in the\r\nSouth Atlantic and Gulf States, but owing to their wanton destruction by\r\nman, they have been exterminated in the greater portion of their range,\r\nand now are rarely seen in any locality, and then only in the most\r\nunhabitable swamps and thickets. A reliable account of their nesting\r\nhabits is lacking, as are also specimens of their eggs taken from wild\r\nbirds. They are said to build rude nests of sticks upon horizontal\r\nbranches of cypress trees, and to nest in colonies; it is also claimed\r\nthat they nest in hollow trees, laying from three to five pure white\r\neggs. The one figured is one of three laid in confinement at Washington,\r\nD. C., by a pair of birds owned by Mr. Robert Ridgeway. It is 1.31 ×\r\n1.06 and was laid July 12, 1892. This set is in the collection of Mr.\r\nJohn Lewis Childs.\r\n\r\n\r\n382.1. Thick-billed Parrot. _Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north casually to the Mexican border of the United\r\nStates. This large Parrot (16 inches long) has a heavy black bill, and\r\nthe plumage is entirely green except for the deep red forehead, strips\r\nover the eye, shoulder, and thighs, and the yellowish under wing\r\ncoverts. Their eggs are white and are laid in natural cavities in large\r\ntrees in forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCKOOS, TROGANS, KINGFISHERS, ETC. Order XIV.\r\n\r\nCUCKOOS, ANIS, ETC. Family CUCULIDAE\r\n\r\n383. ANI. _Crotophaga ani._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northeastern South America and the West Indies; casual in\r\nFlorida, and along the Gulf coast; accidental in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the next, but the bill is smoother and\r\nwithout grooves. Its nesting habits are the same as those of the more\r\ncommon American species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 243: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Carolina Paroquet.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 242\r\n\r\n[Illustration 244: ROADRUNNER.]\r\n\r\nPage 243\r\n\r\n384. GROOVE-BILLED ANI. _Crotophaga sulcirostris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and the border of the United States; common in southern\r\nTexas. This odd species has a Cuckoo-like form, but is wholly blue black\r\nin color, and has a high thin bill with three conspicuous longitudinal\r\ngrooves on each side. They build large bulky nests of twigs, lined with\r\nleaves and grasses, and located in low trees and bushes. They build in\r\nsmall colonies but do not, as is claimed of the common Ani, build a\r\nlarge nest for several to occupy. They lay from three to five eggs of a\r\ngreenish blue color, covered with a chalky white deposit. Size 1.25 ×\r\n1.00. They are laid in May or June.\r\n\r\n\r\n385. ROAD-RUNNER. _Geococcyx californianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from Oregon, Colorado and Kansas,\r\nsouthward; most abundant on the Mexican border, and wintering in central\r\nMexico. This curious species is known as the \"Chaparral Cock\", \"Ground\r\nCuckoo,\" \"Snake-killer,\" etc. Its upper parts are a glossy greenish\r\nbrown, each feather being edged or fringed with whitish; the tail is\r\nvery long, broad and graduated, the feathers being broadly tipped with\r\nwhite. They are noted for their swiftness on foot, paddling over the\r\nground at an astonishing rate, aided by their outstretched wings and\r\nspread tail, which act as aeroplanes; their legs are long and have two\r\ntoes front and two back. Their food consists of lizards and small\r\nsnakes, they being particularly savage in their attacks upon the latter.\r\nThey build rude nests of sticks and twigs, in low trees or bushes, and\r\nduring April or May, lay from four to ten eggs, depositing them at\r\nintervals of several days. They are pure white and measure 1.55 × 1.20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 245: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Road Runner.

MANGROVE CUCKOO. _Coccyzus minor minor._\r\n\r\nRange.--West Indies, Mexico and South America, north regularly to\r\nsouthern Florida.\r\n\r\nThis species is very similar to our common Yellow-billed Cuckoo, but the\r\nwhole underparts are deep buff. It is a common species and nests\r\nabundantly in the West Indies, but occurs only in limited numbers in\r\nsouthern Florida. Their nests are shallow platforms of twigs and\r\nrootlets, placed in bushes and low trees, and upon which they lay three\r\nor four pale greenish blue eggs, similar to those of the Yellow-billed\r\nspecies but averaging smaller; size 1.15 × .85.\r\n\r\n\r\n386a. MAYNARD'S CUCKOO. _Coccyzus minor maynardi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Bahamas; accidental on Florida Keys. This is a slightly smaller\r\nand paler form than the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n387. YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO. _Coccyzus americanus americanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Plains and from southern Canada\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThis species is generally abundant in all localities in its range, which\r\nafford suitable nesting places of tangled underbrush or vines. It may be\r\ndistinguished from the Black-billed variety by its larger size (12\r\ninches long), blackish tail with broad white tips, and yellowish lower\r\nmandible. They are often regarded by the superstitious as forecasters of\r\nrain, and as omens, probably because of their gutteral croaking notes.\r\n\r\nTheir nests are made of twigs, lined with shreds of grape vine bark or\r\ncatkins; the nests are generally very shabbily made and so flat on the\r\ntop that the eggs frequently roll off. They are located near the ground\r\nin bushes or low trees. The three or four eggs are deposited at\r\nintervals of several days, and frequently young birds and eggs are found\r\nin the nest at the same time. Like the Flicker, this bird will\r\nfrequently continue laying if one egg is removed at a time, and as many\r\nas twelve have been taken from the same nest, by this means. The eggs\r\nare light greenish blue. Size 1.20 × .90. They are usually laid during\r\nMay or June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 246: Mangrove Cuckoo.

CALIFORNIA CUCKOO. _Coccyzus americanus occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, from British Columbia, southward.\r\n\r\nSlightly larger and with a stouter bill than the last. Eggs not\r\ndistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n388. BLACK-BILLED CUCKOO. _Coccyzus erythrophthalmus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Rocky Mountains; north to Labrador and\r\nManitoba; south in winter to Central and South America.\r\n\r\nThis species is rather more common in the northern part of the United\r\nStates than the Yellow-billed variety. The bird is smaller, has a\r\nblackish bill, and the tail is the same color as the back and only\r\nslightly tipped with white. Their nests are built in similar locations\r\nand of the same materials as used by the Yellow-bill; the three or four\r\neggs are smaller and a darker shade of greenish blue. Size 1.15 × .85.\r\nAll the Cuckoos are close sitters and will not leave the nest until\r\nnearly reached with the hand, when they will slowly flutter off through\r\nthe underbrush, and continue to utter their mournful \"Kuk-kuk-kuk,\" many\r\ntimes repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n388.1. KAMCHATKA CUCKOO. _Cuculus canorus telephonus._\r\n\r\nAn Asiatic subspecies of the common European Cuckoo, accidentally\r\noccurring in Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROGONS. Family TROGONIDÆ\r\n\r\n389. COPPERY-TAILED TROGON. _Trogon ambiguus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Mexico, north to the Lower Rio Grande in Texas and in\r\nsouthern Arizona, in both of which localities they probably breed.\r\n\r\nThis is the only member of this family of beautiful birds which reaches\r\nour borders. This species is 12 inches in length, and is a metallic\r\ngreen color on the upper parts and breast, and with coppery reflections\r\nof the middle tail feathers, the outer ones being white, very finely\r\nvermiculated with black, as are the wing coverts. The underparts, except\r\nfor a white band across the breast, are rosy red. This species nest in\r\ncavities in large trees, generally in large, deserted Woodpecker holes.\r\nThey are also said to have been found nesting in holes in banks. Their\r\neggs are three or four in number and are a dull white in color. Size\r\n1.10 × .85.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 248: Black-billed Cuckoo.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Dull White.]\r\n[Illustration: 387a--389.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 247\r\n\r\nKINGFISHERS. Family ALCEDINIDÆ\r\n\r\n390. BELTED KINGFISHER. _Ceryle alcyon._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding from southern United States,\r\nnorthward and wintering from the southern parts of its breeding range,\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThis well known bird is abundant in all localities near water, where its\r\nrattling notes are among the most familiar of sounds. Their food is\r\nalmost entirely of small fish, which they catch by plunging upon from\r\ntheir perch on an old dead limb overhanging the water, or by hovering in\r\nthe air like an Osprey. Their nests are located at the end of burrows in\r\nsand banks or the banks of creeks and rivers. These tunnels, which are\r\ndug by the birds, generally commence two or three feet from the top of\r\nthe bank and extend back from six to eight feet, either in a straight\r\nline or curved; the end is enlarged to form a suitable nesting place, in\r\nwhich from five to eight eggs are laid. They are glossy and pure white\r\nin color. Size 1.35 × 1.05. Data.--Lake Quinsigamond, Massachusetts,\r\nJune 6, 1900. 7 eggs at the end of a 6 foot tunnel in a sand bank. Bird\r\nremoved by hand from the nest. Collector, C. E. Howe.\r\n\r\n\r\n390.1. Ringed Kingfisher. _Ceryle torquata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north casually to the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is much larger than the Belted Kingfisher and the\r\nunderparts are nearly all bright chestnut, except the white throat. They\r\nnest in river banks the same as the common American species, and the\r\neggs are white, but larger. Size 1.45 × 1.10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 249: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Belted Kingfisher.]\r\n[Illustration: deco-photo.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 248\r\n\r\n[Illustration 250: C.

TEXAS KINGFISHER. _Ceryle americana septentrionalis_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Texas, south through Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis variety is much smaller than the Belted, length 8 inches, and is a\r\nlustrous greenish above, variously speckled with white, and is white\r\nbelow, spotted with greenish. It is a common and resident species in\r\nsouthern Texas, where it lays its eggs in holes in the banks along\r\nstreams. The eggs are white and glossy, and measure .95 × .70.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODPECKERS. Order XV. PICI.\r\n\r\nFamily PICIDAE\r\n\r\nWoodpeckers are well known birds having sharp chisel-like bills, sharply\r\npointed and stiffened tail feathers, and strongly clawed feet with two\r\ntoes forward and two back, except in one genus. Their food is insects\r\nand grubs, which they get by boring in trees, and from under the bark,\r\nclinging to the sides of trunks or the under side of branches with their\r\nstrong curved nails, aided by the tail, for a prop. They are largely\r\nresident where found.\r\n\r\n\r\n392. IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER. _Campephilus principalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Locally distributed, and rare, in Florida, along the Gulf coast\r\nand north casually to South Carolina and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest of the Woodpeckers found within our borders, being\r\n20 inches in length. But one other American species exceeds it in size,\r\nthe Imperial Woodpecker of Mexico, which reaches a length of nearly two\r\nfeet; as this species is found within a few miles of our Mexican border,\r\nit may yet be classed as a North American bird. The present species has\r\na large, heavy, ivory-white bill. They can readily be identified, at a\r\ngreat distance, from the Pileated Woodpecker by the large amount of\r\nwhite on the secondaries. They used to be not uncommonly seen in many\r\nsections of the southeast but are now found very locally and only in the\r\nlargest and remote woods. They nest in holes in large trees in the most\r\nimpenetrable swamps; laying three, and probably as many as six pure\r\nwhite glossy eggs measuring 1.45 × 1.00.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 251: Texas Kingfisher.]\r\n[Illustration: Ivory-billed Woodpecker.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 250\r\n\r\n393. HAIRY WOODPECKER. _Dryobates villosus villosus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Plains and from North Carolina to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe Hairy Woodpecker or its sub-species is found in all parts of North\r\nAmerica. The nesting habits and eggs of all the sub-species are not in\r\nany way different from those of the eastern bird, consequently what is\r\nsaid in regard to the eastern form will apply equally to all its\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nExcept during the winter months, this species is not as commonly seen\r\nabout houses or orchards as the Downy Woodpecker. During the summer they\r\nretire to the larger woods to nest, laying their eggs in holes in the\r\ntrunks or limbs of trees at any height from the ground, and generally\r\nusing the same hole year after year, and often twice or three times\r\nduring one season, if the first sets are taken. They lay from three to\r\nsix glossy white eggs; size .95 × .70. This species can be distinguished\r\nfrom the Downy Woodpeckers by their larger size (9 inches long), and the\r\nwhite outer tail feathers, which are unspotted.\r\n\r\n\r\n393a. NORTHERN HAIRY WOODPECKER. _Dryobates villosus leucomelas._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, north of the United States.\r\n\r\nSlightly larger than the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n393b. SOUTHERN HAIRY WOODPECKER. _Dryobates villosus auduboni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern United States; north to South Carolina.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Hairy Woodpecker, but smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n393c. HARRIS'S WOODPECKER. _Dryobates villosus harrisi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from California to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Hairy but with fewer or no white spots on the wing\r\ncoverts, and grayish on the underparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n393d. CABANIS WOODPECKER. _Dryobates villosus hyloscopus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern California, east to Arizona and south into Mexico. Like\r\nthe preceding but whiter below.\r\n\r\n\r\n393e. ROCKY MOUNTAIN HAIRY WOODPECKER. _Dryobates villosus monticola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountains from British Columbia south to New Mexico.\r\n\r\nSimilar to _harrisi_ but slightly larger and pure white below.\r\n\r\n\r\n393f. QUEEN CHARLOTTE WOODPECKER. _Dryobates villosus picoideus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia.\r\n\r\nLike Harris Woodpecker, but with the flanks streaked and the middle of\r\nthe back spotted with blackish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 252: Hairy Woodpecker.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 393c--394a.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 251\r\n\r\n394. SOUTHERN DOWNY WOODPECKER. _Dryobates pubescens pubescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Gulf and South Atlantic States; north to South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is the smallest of the North American Woodpecker\r\n(length 6 inches), is similar in plumage to the Hairy Woodpecker, but\r\nhas the ends of the white, outer tail feathers spotted with black. Like\r\nthe last species, it is represented by sub-species in all parts of North\r\nAmerica, the nesting habits of all the varieties being the same and the\r\neggs not distinguishable from one another. They nest in holes in trees,\r\nvery often in orchards or trees in the neighborhood of houses. They are\r\nnot nearly as shy as the Hairy Woodpeckers, and also associate with\r\nother birds very freely. The three to six eggs are laid upon the bottom\r\nof the cavity, with no lining. The height of the nesting season is\r\nduring May or June. The white glossy eggs are .75 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n394a. GAIRDNER'S WOODPECKER. Dryobates pubescens gairdneri.\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from northern California to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is like the last, but is without spots on the wing\r\ncoverts and is a dingy white below, differing the same as Harris\r\nWoodpecker from the Hairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n394b. BATCHELDER'S WOODPECKER. _Dryobates pubescens homorus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region of the United States.\r\n\r\nLike the last but whiter below.\r\n\r\n\r\n394c. DOWNY WOODPECKER. _Dryobates pubescens medianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains and north of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the southern variety but slightly larger and whiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n394d. NELSON'S DOWNY WOODPECKER. _Dryobates pubescens nelsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Alaska.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the northern variety but still larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n394e. WILLOW WOODPECKER. _Dryobates pubescens turati._\r\n\r\nRange.--California except the northern parts and the ranges of the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Gairdner Woodpecker, but smaller and whiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n395. RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER. _Dryobates borealis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southeastern United States, from South Carolina and Arkansas,\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThis black and white species may be known from any other because of the\r\nuniform black crown and nape, the male having a small dot of red on\r\neither side of the crown, back of the eye. They are quite abundant in\r\nthe Gulf States and Florida, where they nest during April and May, and\r\nin some localities in March. They build in hollow trees or stumps at an\r\nelevation from the ground, laying from three to six glossy white eggs;\r\nsize .95 × .70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 253: white, glossy.]\r\n[Illustration: Southern Downy.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 252\r\n\r\n396. TEXAS WOODPECKER. _Dryobates scalaris bairdi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States from southern Colorado south to\r\nnorthern Mexico. This species is brownish white below, has the back\r\nbarred with black and white, and the male has the whole crown red,\r\nshading into mixed black and whitish on the forehead. Its habits and\r\nnesting are just the same as those of the Downy, but the three or four\r\nwhite eggs, that they lay in April, are larger; size .80 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n396a. SAN LUCAS WOODPECKER. _Dryobates scalaris lucasanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California, north to the Colorado Desert, California.\r\n\r\nVery similar to the last; less barring on the outer tail feathers. Eggs\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\r\n397. NUTTALL'S WOODPECKER. _Dryobates nuttalli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Oregon south to Lower California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Texan Woodpecker but whiter below, with whitish nasal\r\ntufts, and the fore part of the crown black and white striped, the red\r\nbeing confined to the nape region. They nest in holes in trees, either\r\nin dead stumps or in growing trees, and at any height above ground.\r\nDuring April or May they deposit their white glossy eggs upon the bottom\r\nof the cavity. The eggs measure .85 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n398. ARIZONA WOODPECKER. _Dryobates arizonæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican border of the United States, chiefly in Arizona and New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThis species is entirely different from any others of our Woodpeckers,\r\nbeing uniform brownish above, and soiled whitish below, spotted with\r\nblack. The male bird has a red crescent on the nape. They are said to be\r\nfairly abundant in some sections of southern Arizona. Their nesting\r\nhabits do not vary from those of the other Woodpeckers found in the same\r\nregions, and they show no especial preference for any particular kind of\r\na tree in which to lay their eggs. The nesting season appears to be at\r\nits height in April. The pure white eggs average in size about .85 ×\r\n.60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 254: Red-cockaded Woodpecker. Texas Woodpecker.]\r\n[Illustration: 398--399.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 253\r\n\r\n399. WHITE-HEADED WOODPECKER. _Xenopicus albolarvatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from southern California to southern\r\nBritish Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis odd species is wholly a dull black color, except for the white head\r\nand neck, and basal half of the primaries. They are quite abundant in\r\nsome localities, particularly in California on mountain ranges. They\r\nnest at any height, but the greater number have been found under twenty\r\nfeet from the ground and in old pine stubs. They lay from four to six\r\nglossy white eggs, measuring .95 × .70. They are said to be more silent\r\nthan others of the Woodpecker family, and rarely make the familiar\r\ntapping and never drum. It is claimed that they get at their food by\r\nscaling bark off the trees, instead of by boring.\r\n\r\n\r\n400. ARCTIC THREE-TOED WOODPECKER. _Picoides arcticus._\r\n\r\nAs implied by their name, members of this genus have but three toes, two\r\nin front and one behind. The plumage of this species is entirely black\r\nabove, and whitish below, with the flanks barred with blackish. The male\r\nhas a yellow patch on the crown. They breed abundantly in coniferous\r\nforests in mountainous regions throughout their range, laying their eggs\r\nin cavities in decayed stumps and trees, apparently at any height, from\r\nfive feet up. The eggs are laid in May or June. Size .95 × .70.\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern parts of the United States, north to the Arctic\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n401. THREE-TOED WOODPECKER. _Picoides americanus americanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--From northern United States northward.\r\n\r\nThe chief difference between this species and the last is in the white\r\non the back, either as a patch or in the form of broken bars. The\r\nnesting habits are just the same and the eggs cannot be distinguished\r\nfrom those of the preceding. Both forms are found breeding in the same\r\nlocalities in the Adirondacks and in nearly all other portions of their\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 255: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Three-toed Woodpecker. Arctic Three-toed Woodpecker.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 254\r\n\r\n401a. ALASKA THREE-TOED WOODPECKER. _Picoides americanus fasciatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Alaska, south to British Columbia and Washington.\r\n\r\nLike the last, but with more white on the back. Eggs like the arcticus.\r\n\r\n\r\n401b. ALPINE THREE-TOED WOODPECKER. _Picoides americanus dorsalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountains from British Columbia south to New Mexico.\r\n\r\nSlightly larger than the preceding and with more white on the back,\r\nalmost entirely losing the barred effect of the American Three-toed\r\nvariety. They nest chiefly in dead pines, laying four or five white eggs\r\nthat cannot be distinguished from those of many other species. Size .95\r\n× .70.\r\n\r\n\r\n402. YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER. _Sphyrapicus varius varius._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains; breeding from Massachusetts\r\nnorthward, and wintering from the Carolinas and Illinois southward.\r\n\r\nThis species is one of the most handsomely marked of the family; they\r\ncan easily be recognized by the red crown and throat (white on the\r\nfemale), each bordered by black, and the yellowish underparts. The\r\nmembers of this genus have been found to be the only ones that are\r\nreally injurious, and these only to a slight extent, to cultivated\r\ntrees. This species and the two following are the only real\r\n\"sapsuckers,\" a crime that is often attributed to the most useful of the\r\nfamily. Their nesting season is during May and June, they then resorting\r\nto the interior of the woods, where they deposit their four to seven\r\nglossy eggs on the bottom of holes in trees, generally at quite an\r\nelevation from the ground. Size of eggs .85 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n402a. Red-naped Sapsucker. _Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region of the United States and southern Canada\r\nsouth to Mexico and west to California.\r\n\r\nThis variety differs from the last, chiefly in addition of a band of\r\nscarlet on the nape in place of the white on the Yellow-bellied species.\r\nComing as it does, midway between the ranges of the preceding species\r\nand the following, this variety, with its extension of red on the head\r\nand throat, may be regarded somewhat as a connecting link between the\r\ntwo species, but it is perfectly distinct and does not intergrade with\r\neither. There appears to be no difference in the nesting habits of the\r\ntwo varieties, except that the present one, according to Bendire, shows\r\na preference to nesting in live aspens. The eggs measure .90 × .65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 256: Yellow-bellied Sapsucker.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 255\r\n\r\n403. RED-BREASTED SAPSUCKER. _Sphyrapicus ruber ruber._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast from Lower California to Oregon.\r\n\r\nExcept for a whitish line from the eye to the bill, the entire head,\r\nneck and breast of this species is red, of varying shades in different\r\nindividuals, from carmine to nearly a scarlet; the remainder of their\r\nplumage is very similar to that of the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker. This is\r\nan abundant species and in most parts of the range they are not timid.\r\nLike many of the Woodpeckers, they spend a great deal of their time in\r\ndrumming on some dead limb. They nest commonly in aspens, preferably\r\nliving ones, and are said to build a new nesting hole each year rather\r\nthan use the old. The eggs are laid during May or June, being glossy\r\nwhite, five to seven in number, and measuring .90 × .70.\r\n\r\n\r\n403a. NORTHERN RED-BREASTED SAPSUCKER. _Sphyrapicus ruber notkensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from California to Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\n404. WILLIAMSON'S SAPSUCKER. _Sphyrapicus thyroideus._\r\n\r\nThis is a deeper and brighter variety, and is more yellowish on the\r\nbelly. Its nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of the southern\r\nform.\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountain ranges from the Rockies to the Pacific; north to\r\nBritish Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis oddly marked species shows a surprising number of variations in\r\nplumage; the normal adult male is largely black on the upper parts and\r\nbreast, with only a narrow patch of red on the throat, and with the\r\nbelly, bright yellow. The female is entirely different in plumage and\r\nfor a long time was supposed to be a distinct species; she is brownish\r\nin place of the black in the male, has no red in the plumage, and is\r\nbarred with black and white on the back and wings. They nest at high\r\naltitudes in mountain ranges, either in coniferous forests or in aspens.\r\nThere is no peculiarity in their nesting habits; they lay from four to\r\nseven eggs, glossy white. Size .97 × .67.\r\n\r\n\r\n405. PILEATED WOODPECKER. _Phlœotomus pileatus pileatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern and South Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nThis heavily built Woodpecker is nearly as large as the Ivory-bill,\r\nbeing 17 inches in length. They are not nearly as beautiful as the\r\nIvory-bills, their plumage being a sooty black instead of glossy, and\r\nthe white on the wing, being confined to a very small patch at the base\r\nof the primaries; the whole crown and crest are vermillion, as is also a\r\nmoustache mark in the male. They breed in the most heavily timbered\r\ndistricts, and generally at a high elevation; excavating a cavity\r\nsometimes 25 inches in depth and eight inches in diameter. In most\r\nlocalities they are very shy and difficult to approach. During April or\r\nMay they lay from three to six white eggs. Size 1.30 × 1.00.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 257: Pileated Woodpecker.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 256\r\n\r\n405a. NORTHERN PILEATED WOODPECKER. _Phlœotomus pileatus abieticola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Local throughout North America, from the northern parts of the\r\nUnited States northward.\r\n\r\nThis variety is only very slightly larger than the preceding, it\r\notherwise being the same. It is still abundant in many localities, but\r\nits range is rapidly being reduced, on account of cutting away the\r\nforests. Its nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of the\r\nsouthern variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n406. RED-HEADED WOODPECKER. _Melanerpes erythrocephalus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Rockies, except New England; north to\r\nnorthern Canada; winters in southern United States.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful species has a bright red head, neck and breast, glossy\r\nblue black back, wings and tail, and white underparts, rump and\r\nsecondaries. It is the most abundant of the family in the greater\r\nportion of its range, where it nests in any kind of trees or in\r\ntelegraph poles at any height from the ground; they also sometimes nest\r\nin holes under the eaves of buildings. They are the most pugnacious of\r\nthe Woodpeckers, and are often seen chasing one another or driving away\r\nsome other bird. They are also known to destroy the nests and eggs of\r\nmany species, and also to kill and devour the young, they being the only\r\nWoodpecker, so far as known, to have acquired this disreputable habit;\r\nthey also feed upon, besides ants and larvæ, many kinds of fruit and\r\nberries. Their nesting season is during May and June, when they lay from\r\nfour to eight white eggs, with less gloss than those of the Flicker.\r\nSize 1.00 × .75.\r\n\r\n\r\n407. ANT-EATING WOODPECKER. _Melanerpes formicivorus formicivorus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican border of the United States, southward.\r\n\r\nThis species may be identified by the black region around the base of\r\nthe bill, the white forehead, red crown and nape, yellowish throat, and\r\nblackish upper parts, extending in a band across the breast, this\r\nvariety having the band streaked with white posteriorly. The habits of\r\nthis variety are the same as the next which is most abundant in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 258: Williamson Sapsucker Northern Pileated Woodpecker.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Red-headed Woodpecker.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 257\r\n\r\n407a. CALIFORNIA WOODPECKER. _Melanerpes formicivorus bairdi._\r\n\r\nRange.--California and Oregon.\r\n\r\nThis bird differs from the last in having fewer white stripes in the\r\nblack breast band. In suitable localities, this is the most abundant of\r\nWoodpeckers on the Pacific coast. They have none of the bad habits of\r\nthe Red-heads, appear to be sociable among their kind, and are not\r\nafraid of mankind. It nests indifferently in all kinds of trees at any\r\nheight from the ground, laying from three to seven eggs. Size 1.00 ×\r\n.75. This species has the habit of storing food for future use developed\r\nto a greater extent than any other of the family. They sometimes\r\ncompletely honeycomb the exterior surface of decayed trees, with holes\r\ndesigned to hold acorns.\r\n\r\n\r\n407b. NARROW-FRONTED WOODPECKER. _Melanerpes formicivorus angustifrons._\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis variety differs from the others in being slightly smaller and in\r\nhaving the white band on the forehead narrower. Its nesting habits are\r\nthe same, but the eggs average smaller. Size .95 × .75.\r\n\r\n\r\n408. LEWIS'S WOODPECKER. _Asyndesmus lewisi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from the Rockies to the Pacific coast;\r\nfrom British Columbia south to Mexico.\r\n\r\nA very oddly colored species, 11 inches in length having a dark red\r\nface, streaked red and white under parts, a gray breast band, and glossy\r\ngreenish black upperparts. They are not uncommon in the greater part of\r\ntheir range, can not be called shy birds, and nest in all kinds of trees\r\nat heights varying from six to one hundred feet from the ground, the\r\nfive to nine white eggs measuring 1.05 × .80, and being laid during May\r\nor June.\r\n\r\n\r\n409. RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER. _Centurus carolinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Plains, breeding from the Gulf States\r\nnorth in nearly all parts of their range, frequenting the more heavily\r\ntimbered regions, where they nest in any place that attracts their\r\nfancy; in some localities they also commonly nest in telegraph poles.\r\nThey are quite tame, and during the winter months come about yards and\r\nhouses, the same as, and often in company with Downy Woodpeckers. Their\r\neggs, which are laid during May, are glossy white, average in size 1.00\r\n× .75 and number from four to six.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 259: Red-bellied Woodpecker.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 258\r\n\r\n410. GOLDEN-FRONTED WOODPECKER. _Centurus aurifrons._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and southern Texas, resident.\r\n\r\nThis is also one of the \"zebra\" or \"ladder-backed\" Woodpeckers, having\r\nthe back and wings closely barred with black and white, the same as the\r\npreceding; the forehead, nasal tufts and nape are golden yellow, and the\r\nmale has a patch of red on the crown. This is a very common resident\r\nspecies in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where it nests in trees\r\nor telegraph poles, sometimes so numerously in the latter situations as\r\nto become a nuisance. Their nesting habits are not in any manner\r\npeculiar, and the eggs cannot be distinguished from those of the\r\npreceding. Size 1.00 × .75. Laid during April and May.\r\n\r\n\r\n411. GILA WOODPECKER. _Centurus uropygialis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican border of the United States, in southern Arizona and New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nLike the preceding but without any yellow on the head, the male having a\r\nred patch in the center of the crown. They are locally distributed in\r\nNew Mexico, but appear to be abundant in all parts of southern Arizona,\r\nwhere they nest principally in giant cacti, but also in many other trees\r\nsuch as cotton-woods, mesquite, sycamores, etc. Besides their decided\r\npreference for giant cacti, there is nothing unusual in their nesting\r\nhabits, and the eggs are not different from those of others of the\r\ngenus. They lay from three to six eggs in April or May. Size 1.00 × .75.\r\n\r\n\r\n412. FLICKER. _Colaptes auratus auratus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southeastern United States.\r\n\r\nFlickers are well known, large Woodpeckers (13 inches long), with a\r\nbrownish tone to the plumage, barred on the back and spotted on the\r\nbreast with black. The present species has a golden yellow lining to the\r\nwings and tail, and the shafts of the feathers are yellow; it has a red\r\ncrescent on the nape, and the male has black moustache marks. This\r\nspecies and its sub-variety are the most widely known Woodpeckers in\r\neastern North America, where they are known in different localities, by\r\nsomething like a hundred local names, of which\r\n\r\n[Illustration 260: 408--411.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 259\r\n\r\nPigeon Woodpecker and Yellow-hammer seem to be the most universal. They\r\nhave the undulating flight common to all Woodpeckers and show the white\r\nrump patch conspicuously when flying. They are often found on the ground\r\nin pastures or on side hills, feeding upon ants; they are more\r\nterrestrial than any others of the family. They nest anywhere, where\r\nthey can find or make a suitable cavity for the reception of their eggs;\r\nin trees in woods or solitary trees in large pastures, in apple trees in\r\norchards, in fence posts, in holes under the roofs of buildings, etc.\r\nThey ordinarily lay from five to ten very glossy eggs, but it has been\r\nfound that they will continue laying, if one egg is removed from the\r\nnest at a time, until in one case seventy-one eggs were secured. Fresh\r\neggs may be found at any time from May until August, as they frequently\r\nraise two broods a season. Size of eggs, 1.10 × .90 with considerable\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n412a. NORTHERN FLICKER. _Colaptes auratus luteus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, east of the Rockies, except the\r\nsoutheastern portion.\r\n\r\nAveraging larger than the preceding, but individual specimens of the\r\nnorthern variety are frequently found to be even smaller than the\r\nsouthern, and vice versa, making the distinction one of the study rather\r\nthan Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n413. RED-SHAFTED FLICKER. _Colaptes cafer collaris._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Rockies.\r\n\r\nThis species is marked similarly to the preceding, but the top of the\r\nhead is brownish instead of gray, and the underparts of the wings and\r\ntail, and their quills are reddish. Neither sex has the red crescent on\r\nthe back of the head, except in the case of hybrids between the two\r\nspecies, but the male has red moustache marks. There are no differences\r\nin the nidification between this species and the preceding, but the eggs\r\nof this average a trifle larger (1.15 × .90).\r\n\r\n\r\n413a. NORTHWESTERN FLICKER. _Colaptes cafer saturatior._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast, breeding from Oregon to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis is a much darker variety of the Red-shafted Flicker, but its\r\nnesting habits or eggs do not differ in any way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 261: Northern Flicker.]\r\n[Illustration: Red-shafted Flicker.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 260\r\n\r\n[Illustration 262: NORTHERN FLICKER.]\r\n\r\nPage 261\r\n\r\n[Illustration 263: G. E. Moulthrope.\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF NORTHERN FLICKER.]\r\n\r\nPage 262\r\n\r\n414. Gilded Flicker. _Colaptes chrysoides._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arizona and southward through Mexico to southern Lower\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThis pale species has the yellowish lining to the wings and tail as in\r\nthe Flicker, but has a pale cinnamon brown crown, no crescent on back of\r\nhead, and the male has red moustache marks. It is a common species in\r\nall localities where the giant cactus abounds, and shows a preference to\r\nnesting in these strange growths, to any other trees. Their habits are,\r\nin all respects, the same as those of the other Flickers and their eggs\r\ncannot be distinguished. Size 1.10 × .90.\r\n\r\n\r\n414a. SAN FERNANDO FLICKER. _Colaptes chrysoides brunnescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis is a slightly smaller and darker variety of the Gilded Flicker.\r\n\r\n\r\n415. GUADALUPE FLICKER. _Colaptes rufipileus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Guadalupe Island.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Red-shafted Flicker, but with the crown darker and the\r\nrump a solid pinkish white. They are common in a large cypress grove in\r\nthe middle of the island, but rarely found on any other portions. The\r\neggs have been described by Mr. Walter E. Bryant, who found them\r\nbreeding on the island, to be indistinguishable from those of the others\r\nof the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOATSUCKERS, SWIFTS, AND HUMMINGBIRDS.\r\n\r\nOrder XVI. MACROCHIRES.\r\n\r\nGOATSUCKERS, Family CAPRIMULGIDAE.\r\n\r\nGoatsuckers are long winged birds, with small bills, but with an\r\nextraordinarily large mouth, the opening of which extends beneath and\r\nbeyond the eyes. They are chiefly dusk or night fliers, their food\r\nconsisting of insects which they catch on the wing. Their plumage is\r\nmottled black, brownish and white, resembling the ground upon which they\r\nlay their eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 264.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 263\r\n\r\n416. CHUCK-WILL'S-WIDOW. _Antrostomus carolinensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States, breeding north to Virginia and\r\nIndiana, and west to Arkansas and eastern Texas.\r\n\r\nThese birds are abundant summer residents in the southern portions of\r\ntheir range, but as they are silent and hiding in the woods during the\r\nday time, they are not as popularly known as are most birds. They rarely\r\nfly during the day time unless disturbed from their roosting place which\r\nis on the ground under underbrush or in hollow logs. Their notes, which\r\nare a rapid and repeatedly uttered whistling repetition of their name,\r\nare heard until late in the night. They nest during April, May or June,\r\nlaying two eggs on the ground amid the leaves in woods or scrubby\r\nunderbrush. The eggs are grayish to creamy white in color, handsomely\r\nmarked with shades of lilac, gray and brownish; size 1.40 × 1.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n417. WHIP-POOR-WILL. _Antrostomus vociferus vociferus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains; north to the southern parts of\r\nthe British possessions; winters along the Gulf coast and southward.\r\n\r\nThis species is well known, by sound, in nearly all parts of its range,\r\nbut comparatively few ever observed the bird, and probably the greater\r\nnumber mistake the Nighthawk for this species. The two species can\r\nreadily be distinguished at a distance by the absence of any pronounced\r\nwhite marking in the wings, and by the white tips to the outer tail\r\nfeathers in the present species, while the Night Hawk has a prominent\r\nwhite band across the tail, but the top is black, and the tail slightly\r\nforked. The Whip-poor-will, rarely leaves its place of concealment\r\nbefore dark, and is never seen flying about cities, as are the\r\nNighthawks. In their pursuit of insects, they glide like a shadow over\r\nfields and woods, their soft plumage giving forth no sound as their\r\nwings cleave the air. Until late at night, their whistling cry\r\n\"whip-poor-will,\" repeated at intervals, rings out in all wooded hilly\r\ndistricts. Their two eggs are deposited on the ground among dead leaves,\r\ngenerally in dense woods. They are grayish white or cream color marbled\r\nwith pale brown and gray, with fainter markings of lilac. Size 1.50 ×\r\n.85.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 265: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Chuck-will's-widow.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Whip-poor-will.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 264\r\n\r\n417a. STEPHEN'S WHIP-POOR-WILL. _Antrostomus vociferus macromystax._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arizona and New Mexico, south through the tableland of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is slightly larger and has longer mouth bristles than\r\nthe eastern bird. Their nesting habits are the same and the eggs differ\r\nonly in averaging lighter in color, with fainter markings, some\r\nspecimens being almost immaculate.\r\n\r\n\r\n418. POOR-WILL. _Phalænoptilus nuttalli nuttalli._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Mississippi, breeding from Kansas and\r\nnorthern California northward to Montana and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is the smallest of the family, being under 8\r\ninches in length. Its plumage is mottled black, white and frosty gray,\r\nharmoniously blended together. They can easily be distinguished from all\r\nother Goatsuckers by their size and silvery appearance. They nest on the\r\nground, either placing their two eggs upon a bed of leaves or upon a\r\nflat rock. The breeding season is from the latter part of May through\r\nJuly. The eggs are pure white and glossy; size 1.00 × .75.\r\n\r\n\r\n418a. FROSTED POOR-WILL. _Phalænoptilus nuttalli nitidus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Texas and Arizona, north to western Kansas.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like the last but paler, both above and below. Eggs\r\nindistinguishable from those of others of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n418b. DUSKY POOR-WILL. _Phalænoptilus nuttalli californicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--A darker race found on the coast of California, having the same\r\nnesting habits as the others.\r\n\r\nThe egg figured is of this species. Data.--Los Angeles, Cal., June 24,\r\n1900. 2 eggs on the ground at the foot of an oak tree on the side of a\r\nhill. Collector, F. M. Palmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 266: Poor-will. Merrill's Paraque.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 265\r\n\r\n419. MERRILL'S PARAUQUE. _Nyctidromus albicollis merrilli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north to the Lower Rio Grande in southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is the same length as the Chuck-will's-widow, but is not as\r\nstoutly built, and has a slightly longer tail. It can be distinguished\r\nfrom any other of the family by its tail, the outer feather on each side\r\nbeing black (or brownish barred with black in the female), and the next\r\ntwo having white ends for nearly half their length. Their eggs are laid\r\non the ground in open localities, and generally under the protection of\r\nan overhanging bush. They are two in number and differ greatly from\r\nthose of any other American member of this family, being a buff or rich\r\nsalmon buff in color, spotted and splashed with gray, lavender, and\r\nreddish brown; size 1.25 × .90. Data.--Brownsville, Texas, April 16,\r\n1900. Eggs laid on the ground in a dense thicket. Collector, Frank B.\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 267: Salmon buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Geo. S. Fiske.

NIGHTHAWK. _Chordeiles virginianus virginianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains and from Labrador to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico; winters through Mexico to northern South America.\r\n\r\nThe Nighthawk or some of its sub-species is found in nearly all parts of\r\nNorth America, its habits being the same in all localities. It is of the\r\nsame size as the Whip-poor-will, from which species it can readily be\r\ndistinguished by its lack of mouth bristles, forked tail with a white\r\nband near the end, and the white band across the primaries, the latter\r\nmark showing very plainly during flight. Besides in the country, they\r\nare very common in cities, where they will be seen any summer day\r\ntowards dusk flying, skimming, sailing, and swooping over the tops of\r\nthe buildings, upon the gravel roofs on which they often lay their eggs.\r\nThey nest generally on rocky hillsides or in open woods, laying their\r\ntwo eggs upon the top of a flat rock. The eggs are a grayish white\r\ncolor, marbled, blotched and spotted with darker shades of gray. Size\r\n1.20 x .85.\r\n\r\n420a. WESTERN NIGHTHAWK. _Chordeiles virginianus henryi._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Plains.\r\n\r\nA similar bird to the preceding, but with plumage somewhat more rusty.\r\nIt frequents the more open portions of the country in its range, its\r\nhabits and nesting habits being the same as others of the former\r\nspecies; the eggs average a trifle lighter in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n420b. FLORIDA NIGHTHAWK. _Chordeiles virginianus chapmani._\r\n\r\nRange.--A smaller and paler form found in Florida and along the Gulf\r\ncoast. No difference can be observed in the nesting habits of this as\r\ncompared with the northern form and the eggs are indistinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 268: Nighthawk.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 267\r\n\r\n[Illustration 269: J.

SENNETT'S NIGHTHAWK. _Cordeiles virginianus sennetti._\r\n\r\nRange.--A very pale species with little or no tawny; found in the Great\r\nPlains from Texas north to the Saskatchewan; winters south of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n421. TEXAS NIGHTHAWK. _Chordeiles acutipennis texensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and Central America, breeding north to southern Utah and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe pattern of the marking of this species is finer and more mottled\r\nwith rusty than the Nighthawk. Its habits do not differ to any extent\r\nfrom those of the preceding species; they lay their two mottled gray\r\neggs upon the bare ground, often on the dry sand and in arid regions\r\nwhere they are exposed, with no protection, to the scorching rays of the\r\nsun. The eggs vary endlessly in extent of markings, some being very pale\r\nand others very dark gray, mottled with various shades of gray, brown\r\nand lilac. Size 1.10 x .75.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWIFTS. Family MICROPODIDÆ\r\n\r\n422. BLACK SWIFT. _Cypseloides niger borealis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountain ranges from Central America north to British Columbia,\r\nlocally distributed throughout its range.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of this Swift is entirely sooty black, darkest above; the\r\ntail is slightly forked and is without spines; length of bird, 7 inches.\r\nAlthough the general habits of this species are well known, little is\r\nknown of their nesting; they are seen during the breeding season about\r\nthe higher ranges throughout their United States habitat, and are\r\nsupposed to nest in crevices on the face of cliffs at a high altitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 270: 420-421.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: 422-424.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 269\r\n\r\n423. CHIMNEY SWIFT. _Chætura pelagica._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding from central Canada,\r\nsouth to the Gulf coast, and wintering south of our borders.\r\n\r\nThis well known species is sooty brownish black, 5.5 inches long, and\r\nhas the tail feathers terminating in sharp spines. They are very\r\nabundant in all portions of their range, and may be seen on the wing at\r\nall hours of the day, but especially abundant in the early morning and\r\ntoward dusk. They formerly dwelt and bred only in hollow trees, and a\r\ngreat many still continue to do so, as large hollow stumps are known\r\nwhere hundreds nest every year. The majority of the eastern Chimney\r\nSwifts now nest in old chimneys that are unused, at least during the\r\nsummer; some small chimneys contain but a single pair while other large\r\nones may have from fifty to a hundred or more nests glued to the sides.\r\nThe birds are on the wing during the greater part of the day, generally\r\nnot frequenting the vicinity of their nesting site, but returning toward\r\ndusk, when they may\r\n\r\n[Illustration 271: Chimney Swift.]\r\n[Illustration: E. R. Forrest. NEST AND EGGS OF CHIMNEY SWIFT.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 270\r\n\r\nbe seen to, one at a time, dive headforemost into the tops of chimneys.\r\nThe nest is made of small twigs firmly glued to the sides of the\r\nchimney, or tree, and to each other, with the glutinous saliva of the\r\nbird, making a narrow semi-circle platform for the reception of their\r\nthree to five white eggs which are deposited in May or June; size .75 ×\r\n.50.\r\n\r\n\r\n424. VAUX'S SWIFT. _Chætura vauxi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, chiefly west of the Rockies; breeding\r\nnorth to British Columbia, and wintering south of the United States.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the last but smaller (length 4.5 inches), and paler in color,\r\nfading to white on the throat. The habits of this species are like those\r\nof the eastern Chimney Swift, except that the majority of these species\r\nstill continue to use hollow trees as nesting places. The eggs are just\r\nlike those of the last bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n425. WHITE-THROATED SWIFT. _Æronautes melanoleucus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States south of Canada, and chiefly in the Rocky\r\nMountains, and in California ranges, north to Lat. 38°.\r\n\r\nA handsome species, 6.5 inches in length, with blackish upper parts and\r\nsides, and white throat, breast and central line of under parts, flank\r\npatches and ends of secondaries; tail feathers not spined or stiffened.\r\nThese birds are fairly common in some localities within their range, but\r\nappear to be found only on high ranges or in their immediate vicinity.\r\nThey nest in crevices and caves in the face of cliffs, making a nest\r\nsimilar in construction to that of the Chimney Swift but of weed stalks\r\ninstead of twigs, and lined with feathers. They lay four or five dull\r\nwhite eggs, during June or July; size .85 × .50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 272: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 425--426.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 271\r\n\r\nHUMMINGBIRDS. Family TROCHILIDAE\r\n\r\nHummingbirds have been truly called \"Winged Gems.\" They are the smallest\r\nof birds, the usual plumage being a metallic green with throat or crown\r\npatches of the brightest of iridescent shining red, orange, blue or\r\nviolet. Their nests are marvels of architecture being compactly and\r\nintricately made of plant fibres and downy feathers ornamented in some\r\ncases with lichens. Their flight is accompanied by a peculiar buzzing\r\nsound produced by their rapidly vibrating stiffened wing feathers. Their\r\nfood is small insects and honey both of which they get chiefly from\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n426. RIVOLI'S HUMMINGBIRD. _Eugenes fulgens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north in summer to southern Arizona where they breed at\r\nhigh elevations in the Huachuca Mountains.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most gorgeous of the Hummers having the crown a\r\nviolet purple color, and the throat brilliant green. This species\r\nsaddles its nest upon branches often at heights of 20 or 30 feet from\r\nthe ground. They are made of plant down and generally decorated with\r\nlichens on the outside, similar to nests of the Ruby-throat. The two\r\nwhite eggs measure .65 × .40.\r\n\r\n\r\n427. BLUE-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD. _Cyanolæmus clemenciæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north in summer to the border of Arizona and western New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThis species is the largest of North American Hummers being 5.25 inches\r\nlong, this being slightly larger than the preceding. As the name\r\nimplies, it has a patch of blue on the throat, the upper parts being a\r\nuniform greenish; the outer tail feathers are broadly tipped with white.\r\nTheir nests, which are placed upon the limbs of trees, are made of\r\nmosses and plant fibres covered with cobwebs. The two eggs are laid\r\nduring July and August, and measure .65 × .40.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 273: 427--429.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 272\r\n\r\n[Illustration 274: J. H. Miller.\r\nFEMALE RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD ON NEST.]\r\n\r\nPage 273\r\n\r\n428. RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD. _Archilochus colubris._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains and north to Labrador.\r\n\r\nThis is the only representative of the family found east of the\r\nMississippi. It is a small species, 3.5 inches long, with greenish upper\r\nparts and a bright ruby throat. Its nest is as beautiful, if not more\r\nso, than that of any other species. They build their nests on horizontal\r\nlimbs of trees at any height from the ground, but usually more than six\r\nfeet. Branches an inch or more in diameter are usually selected, they\r\nnot being particular as to the kind of tree, but oaks, pines and maples\r\nperhaps being used the most often. The nests are made of plant fibres\r\nand down, and the exterior is completely covered with green lichens so\r\nthat it appears like a small bunch of moss on the limb. The two white\r\neggs are laid in May or June; size .50 × .35.\r\n\r\n\r\n429. BLACK-CHINNED HUMMINGBIRD. _Archilochus alexandri._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Rocky Mountains; north to British\r\nColumbia; winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nSimilar in size and appearance to the Ruby-throat, but with the chin and\r\nupper throat black, the rest of the throat gorget being violet or\r\namethyst. It is an abundant species in summer in many localities,\r\nespecially in the southern half of its range. They build their nests at\r\nlow elevations, rarely above ten feet, on small branches or the fork at\r\nthe end of a limb. The nests are made of yellowish plant fibres and are\r\nnot covered with lichens, so that they have a peculiar spongy\r\nappearance. Eggs indistinguishable from those of the Ruby-throat. Laid\r\nduring April, May or June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 275: Ruby-throated Hummingbird.]\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 274\r\n\r\n[Illustration 276: RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD.]\r\n\r\nPage 275\r\n\r\n430. COSTA'S HUMMINGBIRD. _Calypte costæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States; north to southern Utah; winters\r\nsouth of our border.\r\n\r\nSmaller than the last and with both the crown and the throat gorget,\r\nviolet or amethyst, the feathers on the sides of the latter being\r\nlengthened. Their nests are situated in the forks of branches generally\r\nnear the ground, and seldom above six feet from it. They are made of\r\nplant down with shreds of weeds, bark and lichens worked into the\r\noutside portions, and are often lined with soft feathers. The two eggs\r\naverage .48 × .32. Data.--Arroyo Seco, California, June 10, 1900. Nest\r\nin an alder bush. Collector, Charles E. Groesbeck.\r\n\r\n\r\n431. ANNA'S HUMMINGBIRD. _Calypte anna_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of the United States from northern California,\r\nsouthward, wintering in Mexico and southern California.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species has both the crown and the broadened and\r\nlengthened throat gorgets, a purplish pink; it is slightly larger than\r\nthe Ruby-throat. They are very abundant in their restricted range, and\r\nnest in February and March and again in April or May, raising two broods\r\na season. Their nests are made of plant down and covered on the outside\r\nwith cobwebs and a few lichens, and are generally located at a low\r\nelevation. The white eggs average .50 × .30. Data.--Santa Monica,\r\nCalifornia, March 4, 1897. Nest in a bunch of seed pods in a gum tree,\r\nten feet from the ground. Collector, Tom Bundy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 277: 430--431.]\r\n[Illustration.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 276\r\n\r\n432. BROAD-TAILED HUMMINGBIRD. _Selasphorus platycercus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain regions, north to Wyoming; winters south of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the Ruby-throat, but larger and with the back\r\nmore golden green color, and the throat shining lilac. They are very\r\nabundant in Colorado and Arizona, nesting as do the Ruby-throats in the\r\neast, and their nests being similar in construction and appearance to\r\nthose of that species. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those of\r\nother species.\r\n\r\n\r\n433. RUFOUS HUMMINGBIRD. _Selasphorus rufus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, breeding from the Mexican border north to\r\nAlaska and fairly abundant in most of its range.\r\n\r\nA handsome little species with the back and tail reddish brown, and with\r\na throat gorget of orange red, the feathers being slightly lengthened\r\ninto a ruff on the side of the gorget. They nest in a great variety of\r\nlocations and at a low elevation, such as vines, bushes and the low\r\nhanging branches of trees. The nest is made of vegetable fibres covered\r\nwith cobwebs and often with lichens. The eggs do not differ from those\r\nof the other Hummers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 278: 432--433--434.]\r\n[Illustration:.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 277\r\n\r\n434. ALLEN'S HUMMINGBIRD. _Selasphorus alleni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from British Columbia southward; most abundant in\r\nCalifornia. Winters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species is like the last, but the back is greenish, only the tail\r\nbeing reddish brown. These birds generally locate their nests at low\r\nelevations near the end of overhanging branches, on vines, weed stalks,\r\nor bushes, but have been found as high as 90 feet above ground. The\r\nnests of this species are made of plant fibres and cobwebs, generally\r\ndecorated with lichens. The two white eggs measure .50 × .32.\r\nData.--Santa Monica, Cal., May 29, 1896. Nest two feet from the ground\r\nin a sage bush. Collector, W. Lee Chambers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 279.]\r\n[Illustration: E. L. Bickford.

MORCOM'S HUMMINGBIRD. _Atthis morcomi._\r\n\r\nRange.--This species is known only from a single specimen, taken in the\r\nHuachuca Mountains, Arizona, in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n436. CALLIOPE HUMMINGBIRD. _Stellula calliope._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from British Columbia southward, and from\r\nthe Rocky Mountains west to eastern Oregon and California.\r\n\r\nThis is the smallest of North American Hummers, being but 3 inches in\r\nlength. It is greenish above and has a violet gorget showing the white\r\nbases of the feathers. They build their nests in all manner of locations\r\nfrom high up in tall pines to within a foot of the ground in slender\r\nbushes. The nests are made interiorly with plant down, but the outside\r\nis generally grayish colored shreds and lichens. The eggs average but a\r\ntrifle smaller than those of _colubris_, .45 × .30.\r\n\r\n\r\n437. LUCIFER'S HUMMINGBIRD. _Calothorax lucifer._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north to southwestern Texas and Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is common in parts of Central Mexico, occurs only\r\ncasually north to our borders and has not yet been found nesting there.\r\nThey build small compact nests of plant down attached to the stalks or\r\nleaves of plants or weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n438. REIFFER'S HUMMINGBIRD. _Amizilis tzacatl._\r\n\r\nRange.--Abundant in southern Mexico; casual in southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is greenish above, with a bronzy lustre; the tail is\r\nreddish brown, and the throat and breast are metallic green. They breed\r\nabundantly about houses and nest apparently at all seasons of the year\r\nin Central America, where they are the most common species of Hummers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 280: 436--437--438.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 279\r\n\r\n439. BUFF-BELLIED HUMMINGBIRD. _Amizilis cerviniventris chalconota._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas and southward through Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese birds are like the last but have the underparts a pale brownish\r\nbuff color. They are quite common in their summer range in the United\r\nStates, nesting at a low elevation in bushes and low trees. The two eggs\r\nare white, .50 × .35. Data.--Brownsville, Texas, May 5, 1892. Nest of\r\nfine bark-like fibre on the outside, lined with lint from thistle plant;\r\nlocated on limb of small hackberry. Collector, Frank G. Armstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n440. XANTUS' HUMMINGBIRD. _Basilinna xantusi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nA handsome species, greenish above, with a coppery tinge and shading\r\ninto reddish brown on the tail; under parts buffy, throat metallic\r\ngreen, and a broad white streak behind the eye. They breed on the ranges\r\nmaking a similar nest to those of other Hummers, placed on weeds or\r\nbushes near the ground. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those of\r\nthe majority of other species.\r\n\r\n\r\n440.1. WHITE-EARED HUMMINGBIRD. _Basilinna leucotis._\r\n\r\nRange.--A Central American and Mexican species, casually found on the\r\nranges in Southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of this species is greenish above and below, being metallic\r\ngreen on the breast; the forehead, sides of head, and throat are\r\niridescent blue and a white line extends back from the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n441. BROAD-BILLED HUMMINGBIRD. _Cynanthus latirostris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of central Mexico north to southern Arizona and New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThe throat of this species is a rich metallic blue; otherwise the\r\nplumage is greenish above and below, being brighter and more irisdescent\r\non the breast. They are not uncommon on the ranges of southern Arizona,\r\nwhere they have been found nesting in July and August, their nest not\r\nbeing unlike those of the Rufous Hummer, but with the exterior largely\r\ncomposed of shreds of grayish bark and lichens. Their eggs are like many\r\nothers of the Hummers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 281: 439--440.1--441.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 280\r\n\r\nPERCHING BIRDS.

This is the\r\nonly representative of this tropical family that has been found as yet\r\nover the Mexican border, but its near ally, the Rose-throated Becard has\r\nbeen found within a very few miles and will doubtless be added to our\r\nfauna as an accidental visitor ere long. Their nests are large masses of\r\ngrasses, weeds, strips of bark, etc., partially suspended from the forks\r\nof branches. Their eggs number four or five and are a pale buffy gray\r\ncolor, dotted and scratched with a pale reddish brown and dark gray.\r\nSize .95 × .70. The one figured is from a set in the collection of Mr.\r\nCrandall, taken June 1, 1897 at Presidio Sinaloa, Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLYCATCHERS. Family TYRANNIDÆ\r\n\r\nFlycatchers, which are found only in America and chiefly in the tropics,\r\nare insect-eating birds, generally having a grayish colored plumage,\r\nsometimes adorned with a slight crest or a coronal mark of orange, red,\r\nor yellow. Only two of the species found in North America are gaudy in\r\nplumage, the Vermilion, and the Derby Flycatchers. They all have the\r\nhabit of sitting erect on a dead twig, and watching for passing insects,\r\nwhich they catch on the wing.\r\n\r\n\r\n442. FORK-TAILED FLYCATCHER. _Muscivora tryannus._\r\n\r\nRange.--A Central and South American species accidentally having\r\noccurred in the United States on several occasions.\r\n\r\nThis is a handsome black, white and gray species of the size and form of\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 282: Buffy gray.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 281\r\n\r\n443. SCISSOR-TAILED FLYCATCHER. _Muscivora forficata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north through Texas to southern Kansas; accidental in\r\nother parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Scissor-tail or \"Texan Bird of Paradise\" is the most beautiful\r\nmember of this interesting family. Including its long tail, often 10\r\ninches in length and forked for about 6 inches, this Flycatcher reaches\r\na length of about 15 inches. It is pale grayish above, fading into\r\nwhitish below, and has scarlet linings to the wings, and a scarlet crown\r\npatch. They are one of the most abundant of the breeding birds in Texas,\r\nplacing their large roughly built nests in all kinds of trees and at any\r\nelevation, but averaging between ten and fifteen feet above ground. The\r\nnests are built of rootlets, grasses, weeds and trash of all kinds, such\r\nas paper, rags, string, etc. The interior is generally lined with plant\r\nfibres, hair or wool. They lay from three to five, and rarely six eggs\r\nwith a creamy white ground color, more or less spotted and blotched with\r\nreddish brown, lilac and gray, the markings generally being most\r\nnumerous about the larger end. They average in size about .90 × .67.\r\nData.--Corpus Christi, Texas, May 18, 1899. 6 eggs. Nest of moss, vines,\r\netc., on small trees in open woods near town. Collector, Frank B.\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n444. KINGBIRD. _Tyrannus tyrannus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Temperate North America, breeding from the Gulf of Mexico north\r\nto New Brunswick, Manitoba and British Columbia; rare off the Pacific\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThis common Tyrant Flycatcher is very abundant in the eastern parts of\r\nits range. They are one of the most pugnacious and courageous of birds\r\nattacking and driving away any feathered creature to which they take a\r\ndislike, regardless of size. Before and during the nesting season, their\r\nsharp, nerve-racking clatter is kept up all day long, and with redoubled\r\nvigor when anyone approaches their nesting site. They nest in any kind\r\nof a tree, in fields or open woods, and at any height from the ground,\r\nbeing found on fence rails within two feet of the ground or in the tops\r\nof pines 70 or 80 feet above the earth. Nearly every orchard will be\r\nfound to contain one or\r\n\r\n[Illustration 283: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Scissor-tailed Flycatcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Cream color.]\r\n[Illustration: Kingbird.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 282\r\n\r\nmore pairs of these great insect destroyers; if more than one pair,\r\nthere will be continual warfare as often as one encroaches on the\r\ndomains of the other. Their nests are made of strips of vegetable fibre,\r\nweeds, etc., and lined with horsehair or catkins. They are sometimes\r\nquite bulky and generally very substantially made. The three to five\r\neggs are laid the latter part of May, and are of a creamy ground color\r\nsplashed with reddish brown and lilac. Size .95 × .70. Data.--Worcester\r\nCounty, Massachusetts, June 3, 1895. 4 eggs. Nest 10 feet from the\r\nground in an apple tree; made of fibres, string, rootlets and weeds,\r\nlined with horse hair. Collector, F. C. Clark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 284: G. E. Moulthrope. NEST AND EGGS OF KINGBIRD.]\r\n\r\nPage 283\r\n\r\n445. GRAY KINGBIRD. _Tyrannus dominicensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--West Indies; north in April to Florida and the South Atlantic\r\nStates to South Carolina and casually farther.\r\n\r\nThis species is slightly larger than our Kingbird, (9 inches long),\r\ngrayish instead of dark drab above, white below, and without any white\r\ntip to tail. Like the common Kingbird, it has a concealed orange patch\r\non the crown. Their habits and nesting habits are the same as those of\r\nour common bird, but the nest is not generally as well built, and nearly\r\nalways is made largely of twigs. The three or four eggs have a creamy or\r\na creamy pink ground color, spotted and blotched with dark brown and\r\nlilac, most numerously about the large end. Size 1.00 × .73. Tarpon\r\nSprings, Florida, May 28, 1802. Nest of twigs and weeds in a low bush.\r\nCollector, J. A. Southley.\r\n\r\n\r\n446. COUCH'S KINGBIRD. _Tyrannus melancholicus couchi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north in summer to southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is very similar to the next but the throat and breast are\r\nwhite, and the underparts a brighter yellow. Like the other members of\r\nthis genus, these build their nests in any location in trees or bushes,\r\nmaking them of twigs, weeds and moss. Their three or four eggs have a\r\ncreamy ground with a pinkish cast and are spotted with brown and lilac.\r\nSize .97 × .12.\r\n\r\n\r\n447. ARKANSAS KINGBIRD. _Tyrannus verticalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States and southern British Provinces from Kansas\r\nand Minnesota west to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThis species has grayish upper parts, shading into darker on the wings\r\nand tail, and lighter on the throat and upper breast; the underparts are\r\nyellow, and there is a concealed patch of orange on the crown. They are\r\nvery abundant throughout the west, where they have the same familiar\r\nhabits of the eastern species, nesting in all sorts of locations such as\r\nwould be used by the latter. Their nests are made of plant fibres,\r\nweeds, string, paper or any trash that may be handy, being sometimes\r\nquite bulky. Their eggs do not differ in any particular from those of\r\nthe eastern bird, except that they may average a little smaller. Size\r\n.95 × .65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 285: Creamy.]\r\n[Illustration: Gray Kingbird.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Arkansas Kingbird.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 284\r\n\r\n448. CASSIN'S KINGBIRD. _Tyrannus vociferans._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from the Rocky Mountain region to\r\nCalifornia, and from Wyoming southward.\r\n\r\nThis species is like the last except that the throat and breast are\r\ndarker. Their habits, nesting habits and eggs are indistinguishable from\r\nthose of the other Tyrant Flycatchers, and they are fully as courageous\r\nin the defense of their homes against either man or bird, their notes\r\nresembling those of the common Kingbird of the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n449. DERBY FLYCATCHER. _Pitangus sulphuratus derbianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and Central America, breeding north to southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis handsome bird is the largest of the Flycatcher family found in the\r\nUnited States, being 11 inches in length. It has a black crown enclosing\r\na yellow crown patch; a broad black stripe from the bill, through the\r\neye and around the back of the head, is separated from the crown by a\r\nwhite forehead and line over the eye; the throat is white shading into\r\nyellow on the underparts. They are abundant in the interior of Mexico,\r\nbut can hardly be classed as common over our border, where they nest in\r\nlimited numbers. Their nests are unlike those of any of our other\r\nFlycatchers being large masses of moss, weeds and grass, arched over on\r\ntop and with the entrance on the side. The three or four eggs are creamy\r\nwhite, sprinkled chiefly about the large end with small reddish brown or\r\number spots; size 1.15 × .85.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 286: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Derby Flycatcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 285\r\n\r\n451. SULPHUR-BELLIED FLYCATCHER. _Myiodynastes luteiventris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and Central America, breeding north to the Mexican border\r\nof Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar Flycatcher, which is unlike any other American species,\r\ncan only be regarded as a rare breeding bird in the Huachuca Mts. It is\r\n8 inches in length, has a grayish back streaked with black, the tail\r\nlargely rusty brown and the underparts sulphur yellow, streaked on the\r\nbreast and sides with dusky; a yellow crown patch is bordered on either\r\nside by a stripe of mottled dusky, and is separated from the blackish\r\npatch through the eye, by white superciliary lines. Their habits are\r\nsimilar to those of the genus Myiarchus, and, like them, they nest in\r\ncavities in trees, and lay from three to five eggs of a creamy buff\r\ncolor thickly spotted and blotched with brown and purplish, the markings\r\nnot assuming the scratchy appearance of the Crested Flycatchers, but\r\nlooking more like those of a Cardinal; size of egg 1.05 × .75.\r\nData.--Huachuca Mts., Arizona, June 29, 1901. 4 eggs. Nest in the\r\nnatural cavity of a live sycamore tree about fifty feet from the ground;\r\ncomposed of twigs. Collector, O. W. Howard.\r\n\r\n\r\n452. CRESTED FLYCATCHER. _Myiarchus crinitus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains, and from New Brunswick and\r\nManitoba southward; winters from the Gulf States southward.\r\n\r\nThis trim and graceful, but quarrelsome, species is grayish on the head,\r\nneck, and breast, shading to greenish on the back and quite abruptly\r\ninto bright yellow on the underparts; the head is slightly crested and\r\nthe inner webs of all the lateral tail feathers are reddish brown. They\r\nare abundant in most of their range but are generally shy so they are\r\nnot as often seen as many other more rare birds. They nest in cavities\r\nof any kind of trees and at any elevation from the ground, the nest\r\nbeing made of twigs, weeds and trash, and generally having incorporated\r\ninto its make-up a piece of cast off snake skin. They lay from four to\r\nsix eggs of a buffy color, blotched and lined with dark brown and\r\nlavender. Size .85 × .65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 287: Creamy buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Crested Flycatcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 286\r\n\r\n453. ARIZONA CRESTED FLYCATCHER. _Myiarchus magister magister._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Arizona and New Mexico, south through Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis bird is very similar to, but averages slightly larger than the\r\nMexican Flycatcher. Its nesting habits are the same and the eggs cannot\r\nbe distinguished from those of the latter, the nest being most\r\nfrequently found in giant cacti.\r\n\r\n\r\n453a. MEXICAN CRESTED FLYCATCHER. _Myiarchus magister nelsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north to southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the last but is considerably paler. They are\r\ncommon in some localities, nesting in holes in trees or stumps, often\r\nthose deserted by Woodpeckers. Their eggs are like those of the last but\r\naverage paler. Data.--Corpus Christi, Texas, May 10, 1899. Nest in hole\r\nin telegraph pole; made of red cow hair, feathers and leaves. 4 eggs.\r\nCollector, Frank B. Armstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n454. ASH-THROATED FLYCATCHER. _Myiarchus cinerascens cinerascens._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, west of the Plains and south of Canada.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the others of the genus but grayish brown above and with the\r\nunderparts much paler, the throat and breast being nearly white. Like\r\nthe others they nest in cavities in trees, either natural or ones made\r\nby Woodpeckers. Their four to five eggs are lighter in color than those\r\nof crinitus but cannot be distinguished from those of the Mexican\r\nCrested Flycatcher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 288: 453--454.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale buff.]\r\n[Illustration: no caption.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 287\r\n\r\n454b. LOWER CALIFORNIA FLYCATCHER. _Myiarchus cinerascens pertinax._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is similar to Nutting Flycatcher but paler below and\r\ngrayish above.\r\n\r\n\r\n455a. OLIVACEOUS FLYCATCHER. _Myiarchus lawrencei olivascens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico, north to southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis is the smallest of the genus found in the United States, being but\r\n7 inches in length. Except for size it is similar to _crinitus_ but with\r\nvery little, if any, rusty brown on tail, except for a slight edging on\r\nthe outer web. Their nesting sites are the same as those chosen by the\r\nother Crested Flycatcher, but their eggs appear to have but little of\r\nthe scratchy appearance of the other members. They are pale buffy,\r\nspeckled and spotted with brown and lilac; size .80 × .60.\r\nData.--Toluca, Mexico, May 20, 1895. Nest of brown hair and feathers, in\r\nhole in tree in woods. Collector, Fred T. Francis.\r\n\r\n\r\n456. PHŒBE.. _Sayornis phœbe._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Rockies and north to Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nThese very common, grayish colored birds are very often known as \"Bridge\r\nBirds\" because of the frequency with which they construct their nests\r\nunder bridges and arches; they also build in crevices in ledges or among\r\nthe hanging roots near the tops of embankments, and on the rafters or\r\nbeams of old buildings. The nests are made of mud, moss and grass, lined\r\nwith feathers. The four or five eggs measure .75 × .55. Occasionally,\r\neggs will be found that have a few minute spots of reddish brown. Freak\r\nsituations in which to locate their nests are often chosen by these\r\nbirds, such as the brake beam of a freight car, in the crevices of old\r\nwells, hen houses, etc. The birds are one of the most useful that we\r\nhave; being very active and continually on the alert for insects and\r\nbeetles that constitute their whole bill of fare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 289: Buffy.]\r\n[Illustration: Phœbe.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 288\r\n\r\n[Illustration 290: G. E. Moulthrope.\r\nPHOEBE ON NEST.]\r\n\r\nPage 289\r\n\r\n457. Say's Phœbe. _Sayornis sayus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding from southern United States,\r\nnorth to the Arctic regions, and from Kansas and Wisconsin westward.\r\nWinters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis bird is slightly larger than the last (7.5 inches long), and is\r\nrusty brown color on the belly and lower breast. Like the eastern Phœbes\r\nthey are one of the earliest birds to return in the spring and are\r\nabundant in the greater parts of their range. Like the latter, they\r\noften raise two broods a season, one in April and another in July. Their\r\nnests are generally placed on narrow shelves and crevices of ledges, but\r\nthey also nest as commonly about houses and farms as does the eastern\r\nbird. The nests are made of weeds, mosses, fibres and wool, and are\r\nquite flat. They lay four or five white eggs. Size .78 x .58.\r\n\r\n\r\n458. BLACK PHŒBE. _Sayornis nigricans._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and north in summer into the bordering States.\r\n\r\nThis species is of the size of the last but is blackish (darkest on the\r\nhead and breast), with a white belly and under tail coverts, the latter\r\nstreaked with dusky. Their habits and nesting habits are the same as\r\nthose of the eastern Phœbe, they building their nests of mud, moss,\r\nweeds and feathers on ledges or about buildings, and generally close to\r\nor in the vicinity of water. They breed during April or May, laying four\r\nor five white eggs which cannot be distinguished from those of the\r\ncommon Phœbe. Size .75 x .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n458a. WESTERN BLACK PHŒBE. _Sayornis nigricans semiatra._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific Coast of Mexico and the United States, breeding north to\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nThis variety differs from the last in having the under tail coverts pure\r\nwhite. Its nesting habits are precisely the same and the eggs\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 291: 457-458.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 290\r\n\r\n459. OLIVE-SIDED FLYCATCHER. _Nuttallornis borealis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding from the Middle States and\r\nCalifornia northward, and in the Rockies, south to Mexico; winters south\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThese Flycatchers are nowhere abundant, and in some parts of the\r\ncountry, especially in the middle portion, they are very rare. They\r\nbreed very locally and generally not more than one pair in any locality.\r\nIn New England, I have always found them nesting in company with Parula\r\nWarblers, in dead coniferous swamps in which the branches are covered\r\nwith long pendant moss. Their nests are placed high up in the trees,\r\ngenerally above fifty feet from the ground, and on small horizontal\r\nlimbs; they are made of small twigs and rootlets, lined with finer\r\nrootlets and moss, and are very flat and shallow; as they are generally\r\nmade to match the surrounding, they are one of the most difficult nests\r\nto find. They lay three or four cream colored eggs which are spotted\r\nwith reddish brown and lilac, chiefly about the large end. Size .85 x\r\n.65. Data.--Lake Quinsigamond, Massachusetts, June 12, 1897. Nest of\r\ntwigs and moss, about 60 feet above the ground, in a dead pine tree in\r\ncenter of a large wet swamp. Nest could not be seen from the ground, and\r\nwas found by watching the birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 292: Olive-sided Flycatcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 291\r\n\r\n460. COUES'S FLYCATCHER. _Myiochanes pertinax pallidiventris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico, breeding north to central Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis Flycatcher builds one of the most artistic nests created by\r\nfeathered creatures. It bears some resemblance on the exterior to that\r\nof the next species, but it is much more firmly made, and the walls are\r\nusually higher, making a very deeply cupped interior. The outside of the\r\nnest is made of fibres, cobwebs, catkins, etc., firmly felted together\r\nand ornamented with green lichens to match the limb upon which it is\r\nsaddled. The interior is heavily lined with dried, yellowish grasses,\r\nmaking a very strong contrast to the exterior. They are fairly abundant\r\nbirds in the ranges of southern Arizona, where they nest generally\r\nduring June. They lay three eggs of a rich creamy color, spotted and\r\nblotched, chiefly about the larger end, with reddish brown and lilac\r\ngray. Size .95 x .61. Data.--Huachuca Mts., Arizona, July 8, 1897. 3\r\neggs. Nest in a yellow pine about 60 feet up and near the extremity of a\r\nlong slender limb. Elevation 7000 feet. Collector, O. W. Howard.\r\n\r\n\r\n461. WOOD PEWEE. _Myiochanes virens._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains and north to the southern\r\nparts of the British Provinces. Winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best known and one of the most common frequenters of\r\nopen woods, where all summer long its pleasing notes may be heard,\r\nresembling \"Pee-a-wee\" or sometimes only two syllables \"pee-wee.\" They\r\nnest on horizontal limbs at elevations of six feet or over, making\r\nhandsome nests of plant fibres and fine grasses, covered on the exterior\r\nwith lichens; they are quite shallow and very much resembles a small\r\nknot on the limb of the tree. They lay three or four eggs of a cream\r\ncolor spotted in a wreath about the large end, with reddish brown and\r\nlavender; size .80 x .55. Data.--Torrington, Conn., June 16, 1890. Nest\r\nof fibres covered with lichens, saddled on the branch of an oak tree\r\nnear roadside. Collector, John Gath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 293: Cream color.]\r\n[Illustration: Wood Pewee.]\r\n[Illustration: Cream color.]\r\n[Illustration: Chickadee Family.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 292\r\n\r\n[Illustration 294: Guy H. Briggs.\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF WOOD PEWEE.]\r\n\r\nPage 293\r\n\r\n462. WESTERN WOOD PEWEE. _Myiochanes richardsoni richardsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from the Plains to the Pacific, and from\r\nManitoba southward, wintering south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this bird are the same as those of the eastern\r\nPewee, but their nests are more strongly built and generally deeper, and\r\nwithout the outside ornamentation of lichens. They are saddled upon\r\nhorizontal branches, like those of the preceding, as a rule, but are\r\nalso said to have been found in upright crotches like those of the Least\r\nFlycatcher. Their three or four eggs cannot be distinguished from those\r\nof the eastern Wood Pewee.\r\n\r\n\r\n462a. LARGE-BILLED WOOD PEWEE. _Myiochanes richardsoni peninsulæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--This species which differs from the last only slightly, as is\r\nindicated by the name, inhabits the peninsula of Lower California; its\r\nnesting habits and eggs will not differ from those of the other Pewees.\r\n\r\n\r\n463. YELLOW-BELLIED FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax flaviventris._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains and north to Labrador; winters\r\nsouth of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is slightly larger than the Least Flycatcher and is more\r\nyellowish above and below, the breast being quite bright. While common\r\nin some districts it is quite shy and frequents thickly wooded regions,\r\nwhere it is not very often seen. They nest near or on the ground among\r\nrocks or roots of fallen trees, chiefly in swampy places; the nests are\r\nmade in bunches of moss, hollowed out and lined with very fine grasses.\r\nTheir four eggs are creamy or buffy white, spotted and speckled about\r\nthe larger end with reddish brown and gray; size .68 × .51.\r\n\r\n\r\n464. WESTERN FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax difficilis difficilis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, from the Rocky Mountain region to the\r\nPacific, and north to Alaska; winters chiefly south of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis Flycatcher, which is similar to the last, nests in similar\r\nlocations as well as in many others, such as crevices and fissures in\r\nrocks, holes in banks, cavities in trees, rafters in buildings, etc. The\r\nnests are variously made, but consist chiefly of fine grasses, weeds and\r\nfibres. The eggs are as a rule similar to those of the last species and\r\ncannot be distinguished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 295: Yellow-bellied Flycatcher. Acadian Flycatcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 294\r\n\r\n464a. SAN LUCAS FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax difficilis cineritius._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to, but duller in plumage than the Western\r\nFlycatcher. Their nesting habits do not probably vary from those of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n465. ACADIAN FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax virescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to southern New\r\nEngland, and in the Mississippi Valley to Manitoba.\r\n\r\nThis species is very pale below and greenish yellow on the back. They\r\nare among the latest of the migrants to reach our borders and arrive in\r\nthe Middle States about the latter part of May, when they are quite\r\ncommon. They build semi-pensile nests in the forks of bushes or\r\noverhanging branches at heights of from four to twenty feet, the nests\r\nbeing made of rootlets, fibres, fine grasses, etc., and partially\r\nsuspended from the branch; they are quite shallow and loosely\r\nconstructed and often appear more like a bunch of debris deposited in\r\nthe fork by the wind than like the creation of a bird. Their three or\r\nfour eggs are buffy, spotted or specked with brown; size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n466. TRAILL'S FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax trailli trailli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, from the Mississippi Valley to the\r\nPacific; winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is very similar to the next, but the back is said to be\r\nmore brownish. They are common and nest abundantly in thickets and low\r\nscrubby woods, usually placing the nest at a low elevation, preferably\r\nin a clump of willows; the nests are made of fine strips of bark, plant\r\nfibres, and very fine rootlets being woven about and firmly fastened in\r\nupright crotches. Their eggs, which are laid in June, are buffy white,\r\nspecked and spotted, chiefly at the large end, with brownish; size .70 ×\r\n.54.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 296: 464--466.]\r\n[Illustration: Buffy.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 295\r\n\r\n466a. ALDER FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax trailli alnorum._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Mississippi and north to New\r\nBrunswick.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between this and the preceding variety is in the\r\nmore greenish upper parts. They are quite abundant in the breeding\r\nseason from New England and northern New York northward, frequenting, to\r\na great extent, alder thickets bordering streams. Their nests and eggs\r\ndo not differ appreciably from those of the western variety of Traill\r\nFlycatcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n467. LEAST FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax minimus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Rockies and north to the interior of\r\nCanada, wintering south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese little birds (5.5 inches long) are common about houses and\r\norchards on the outskirts of cities, and on the edges of forests or open\r\nwoods. They are very frequently known by the name of Chebec from their\r\ncontinually uttered note. In nearly all instances, the nests are placed\r\nin upright forks at elevations varying from four to twenty-four feet\r\nfrom the ground. The nests are made chiefly of plant fibres, fine\r\ngrasses, string, cobwebs, etc., and the three to five eggs are pale\r\ncreamy white; size .65 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n468. HAMMOND'S FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax hammondi._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, west of the Rockies and from British Columbia\r\nsouthward, wintering south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis western representative of the Least Flycatcher is less abundant and\r\nmore shy, but has the same nesting habits as the eastern birds, placing\r\nits nests either in upright crotches or, more rarely, upon horizontal\r\nbranches at a low elevation. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those\r\nof the last species.\r\n\r\n\r\n469. WRIGHT'S FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax wrighti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding from the Mexican border to\r\nOregon and wintering south of the United States.\r\n\r\nA very similar bird to the last but whiter below. It is a much more\r\nabundant species than the last and is found breeding in open woods and\r\nthickets on all the ranges. The nests are built like those of the Least\r\nFlycatcher and nearly always are found in the crotch of trees or bushes\r\nat a low elevation; their nests, like those of the two preceding\r\nspecies, bear a strong resemblance to those of the Yellow Warblers which\r\nare found in the same localities and locations. The eggs are pale creamy\r\nwhite, four in number and measure .68 × .52.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 297: Least Flycatcher.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 462--469--469.1.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 296\r\n\r\n469.1. GRAY FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax griseus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California, north to southern California.\r\n\r\nThis is a slightly larger species than the preceding and is grayish\r\nabove and paler below, with little or no tinge of brownish or yellow. As\r\nfar as I can learn its eggs have not yet been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n470a. BUFF-BREASTED FLYCATCHER. _Empidonax fulvifrons pygmæus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico, north to southern New Mexico and Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis small bird, which is but 4.75 inches in length, is brownish gray\r\nabove and brownish buff below. It is not a common species anywhere, but\r\nis known to nest during June or July, on high mountain ranges, saddling\r\nits nest of fibres, covered with lichens, on horizontal boughs at quite\r\nan elevation from the ground. The eggs are pale buffy white, unspotted,\r\nand measure .60 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n471. VERMILLION FLYCATCHER. _Pyrocephalus rubinus mexicanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north regularly to southern Texas, Arizona and New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most gaudy attired of all North American birds, being\r\nbrownish gray on the back, wings and tail, and having a bright\r\nvermillion crown, crest and underparts. They are quite common in\r\nsouthern Texas, but far more abundant in the southern parts of Arizona.\r\nTheir habits do not differ from those of other Flycatchers, they living\r\nalmost exclusively upon insects. The majority of their nests can not be\r\ndistinguished from those of the Wood Pewee, being covered with lichens\r\nand saddled upon limbs in a similar manner, but some lack the mossy\r\nornamentation. Their three or four eggs are buffy, boldly blotched with\r\ndark brown and lavender, chiefly in a wreath about the middle of the\r\negg; size .70 × .50. Data.--San Pedro River, Arizona, June 10, 1899.\r\nNest in the fork of a willow about 20 feet above the stream. Collector,\r\nO. W. Howard.\r\n\r\n\r\n472. BEARDLESS FLYCATCHER. _Camptostoma imberbe._\r\n\r\nRange.--Central America; north casually to the Lower Rio Grande in\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThis strange little Flycatcher, several specimens of which have been\r\ntaken in the vicinity of Lomita, Texas, is but 4.5 inches in length,\r\ngrayish in color and has a short bill, the upper mandible of which is\r\ncurved. It has all the habits peculiar to Flycatchers. Their eggs have\r\nnot as yet been found as far as I can learn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 298: Vermillion Flycatcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Buff.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 297\r\n\r\nLARKS. Family ALAUDIDÆ\r\n\r\n473. SKYLARK. _Alauda arvensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Old World, straggling casually to Greenland and Bermuda.\r\n\r\nThis noted foreigner has been imported and liberated a number of times\r\nin this country, but apparently is not able to thrive here, a fact which\r\nwill not cause much regret when we remember the experiment with the\r\nEnglish Sparrow. They are abundant in Europe and Great Britain where\r\nthey nest on the ground in cultivated fields or meadows, laying from\r\nthree to five grayish eggs, marked with brown, drab and lavender.\r\n\r\n\r\n474. HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris alpestris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding in Labrador and about Hudson\r\nBay; winters in eastern United States south to Carolina.\r\n\r\nThis variety of this much sub-divided species is 7.5 inches in length,\r\nhas brownish gray upper parts and is white below with black patches on\r\nthe breast and below the eye, yellowish throat and small black ear\r\ntufts. The various subspecies are all marked alike, their distinction\r\nbeing based upon slight differences in size, variations in the shade of\r\nthe back, or the greater or less intensity of the yellowish throat and\r\nsuperciliary stripe. The nesting habits of all the varieties are the\r\nsame and the eggs differ only in the shade of the ground color, this\r\nvariation among the eggs of the same variety being so great that an egg\r\ncannot be identified without knowing the locality in which it was taken.\r\nThe present variety build their nests on the ground generally under\r\ntufts of grass or in hollows in the moss which is found in their\r\nbreeding range, making them of dried grasses and generally lining them\r\nwith feathers. The eggs are grayish with a slight greenish tinge, and\r\nare specked and spotted over the whole surface with drab, brownish and\r\ndark lavender. The eggs of this and the next variety average\r\nconsiderably larger than those of the more southerly distributed\r\nvarieties; size .92 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n474a. PALLID HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris arcticola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in Alaska and winters south to Oregon and Montana.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest of the Horned Larks and has the throat white, with\r\nno trace of yellow. Its nest is built in similar locations and the eggs\r\nare like those of the preceding species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 299: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: Horned Lark.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 298\r\n\r\n474b. PRAIRIE HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris praticola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the Mississippi Valley from Illinois north to Manitoba\r\nand east to the Middle States; winters south to Carolina and Texas.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is considerably smaller than the Horned Lark, and the\r\nthroat is paler yellow, while the line over the eye and the forehead is\r\nwhite. They are the most abundant and have the most extended range of\r\nany of the better known species. In the Mississippi Valley, where they\r\nare of the most common of the nesting birds, they build on the ground in\r\nmeadows or cultivated fields, and very often in cornfields; the nests\r\nare made of grasses and lined with horse hairs or feathers, and placed\r\nin slight hollows generally under a tuft of grass or sods. They raise\r\ntwo broods a season and sometimes three, laying the first set of eggs in\r\nMarch and another in June or July. The three or four eggs have an olive\r\nbuff ground and are thickly sprinkled with drab and lavender; size .83 ×\r\n.60.\r\n\r\n\r\n474c. DESERT HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris leucolæma._\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains of western United States, east of the Rockies and west of\r\nKansas and Dakota; breeds north to Alberta, and winters south to Mexico,\r\nTexas and southern California.\r\n\r\nThis species is like _praticola_, but paler on the back; nest and eggs\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\r\n474d. TEXAS HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris giraudi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of southeastern Texas.\r\n\r\nA pale variety like _leucolæma_, but smaller; throat bright yellow, and\r\nbreast tinged with yellow. Nest and eggs like those of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n474e. CALIFORNIA HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris actia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California and southern California.\r\n\r\nThis bird is similar to the last but the yellow areas are brighter, and\r\nthe nape and back are ruddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n474f. RUDDY HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris rubea._\r\n\r\nRanges--Sacramento Valley, California.\r\n\r\nThis variety has the yellow areas brighter than in any other and the\r\nback and nape are more ruddy. The eggs cannot be distinguished from\r\nthose of the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 300: Olive buff.]\r\n[Illustration: 474c--474e--474f.]\r\n[Illustration: Olive buff.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 299\r\n\r\n\r\n474g. STREAKED HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris strigata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern United States (Washington, Oregon and northern\r\nCalifornia).\r\n\r\nSimilar to the last, but with the back broadly streaked with black, the\r\nruddy less intense and the underparts tinged with yellowish.\r\n\r\n\r\n474h. SCORCHED HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris adusta._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico, north in summer to southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis variety has the back and nape nearly a uniform pinkish ruddy with\r\nbut little streaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n474i. DUSKY HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris merrilli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern United States and southern British Columbia,\r\nwintering south to central California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to _praticola_ but slightly darker above.\r\n\r\n\r\n474j. SONORA HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris pallida._\r\n\r\nRange.--Gulf coast of northern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe upperparts of this variety are very pale pinkish brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n474k. HOYT'S HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris hoyti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of British America, west of Hudson Bay and east of\r\nAlaska, south in winter in the interior of the United States to Kansas.\r\n\r\nMuch larger than the last; equal in size and similar to _articola_ but\r\nwith the throat yellowish and the upperparts darker and brighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n474l. MONTEZUMA HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western New Mexico and eastern Arizona, south in winter to\r\nnorthern Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis variety has the upperparts pale brownish and not streaked; throat\r\nand forehead yellowish.\r\n\r\n\r\n474m. ISLAND HORNED LARK. _Otocoris alpestris insularis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Santa Barbara Islands, California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to _strigata_ but darker. With the exception of the three large\r\nvarieties of Horned Larks found north of our borders, neither the eggs\r\nnor, in most cases, the birds can be identified without the precise\r\nlocation where they were taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration deco (301).]\r\n[Illustration right hand border.]\r\n\r\nPage 300\r\n\r\nCROWS, JAYS, MAGPIES, ETC.

MAGPIE. _Pica pica hudsonia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America from the Great Plains to the Pacific and\r\nfrom Alaska to Arizona and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese large handsome birds have the entire head, neck and breast velvety\r\nblack, abruptly defined against the white underparts. The back, wings\r\nand tail are greenish or bluish black, and the scapulars, white; length\r\nof bird 20 inches. They are well known throughout the west, where their\r\nbold and thievish habits always excite comment. They nest in bushes and\r\ntrees at low elevations from the ground, making a very large nest of\r\nsticks, with an opening on the side, and the interior is made of weeds\r\nand mud, lined with fine grasses; these nests often reach a diameter of\r\nthree feet and are made of quite large sticks. During April or May, they\r\nlay from four to eight grayish white eggs, plentifully spotted with\r\nbrown and drab. Size 1.25 x .90.\r\n\r\n\r\n476. YELLOW-BILLED MAGPIE. _Pica nuttalli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Middle parts of California, west of the Sierra Nevadas.\r\n\r\nThis species is slightly smaller than the last and has a yellowish bill\r\nand lores, otherwise being precisely like the more common species. Their\r\nhabits do not differ from those of the other, the nests are the same and\r\nthe eggs are indistinguishable. Size 1.25 x .88.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 302: Magpie.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 301\r\n\r\n[Illustration 303: R.

BLUE JAY. _Cyanocitta cristata cristata._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains and north to Hudson Bay;\r\nresident and very abundant in its United States range.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful and bold marauders are too well known to need\r\ndescription, suffice it to say that they are the most beautiful of North\r\nAmerican Jays; but beneath their handsome plumage beats a heart as cruel\r\nand cunning as that in any bird of prey. In the fall, winter and spring,\r\ntheir food consists largely of acorns, chestnuts, berries, seeds, grain,\r\ninsects, lizards, etc., but during the summer months they destroy and\r\ndevour a great many eggs and young of the smaller birds, their taste for\r\nwhich, being so great that they are known to watch a nest until the full\r\ncomplement of eggs is laid before making their theft. They nest in open\r\nwoods or clumps of trees, indifferently, in pines or young trees,\r\nbuilding most often below twenty feet from the ground; the nests are\r\nmade of twigs and rootlets, lined with fine rootlets. During May they\r\nlay from four to six eggs of a greenish buff color spotted with olive\r\nbrown. Size 1.10 x .80.\r\n\r\n\r\n477a. FLORIDA BLUE JAY. _Cyanocitta cristata florincola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and the Gulf coast.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this smaller sub-species are the same as\r\nthose of the northern Blue Jay. Like our birds, they frequently nest\r\nnear habitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n478. STELLER'S JAY. _Cyanocitta stelleri stelleri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from southern California to Alaska; resident and\r\nbreeding throughout its range.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this sub-species are similar in plumage, having a\r\nsooty black head, crest and neck, shading insensibly into dark bluish on\r\nthe back and underparts, and brighter blue on the wings and tail. They\r\nusually have a few streaks or spots of pale blue on the forehead. They\r\nare just as noisy, bold and thievish as the eastern Jay and are also\r\nexcellent mimics like the latter. They nest in fir trees at any height\r\nfrom the ground and in April or May deposit their three to six greenish\r\nblue eggs which are spotted with various shades of brown. Size 1.25 x\r\n.90. Their nests are more bulky than those of the eastern Jay and are\r\nusually made of larger sticks and held together with some mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n478a. BLUE-FRONTED JAY. _Cyanocitta stelleri frontalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast ranges of California and Oregon.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this variety are indistinguishable from\r\nthose of the preceding. The bird has more blue on the forehead.\r\n\r\n\r\n478b. LONG-CRESTED JAY. _Cyanocitta stelleri diademata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Rocky Mountains from Arizona to Wyoming.\r\n\r\nNo general difference can be found between the eggs of this species and\r\nthe Steller Jay, and the nests of each are constructed similarly and in\r\nlike situations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 305: Blue Jay.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish buff.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 304\r\n\r\n[Illustration 306: Dr. J.

BLACK-HEADED JAY. _Cyanocitta stelleri annectens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Rocky Mountains from northern Colorado to British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this sub-species cannot be identified from those of the\r\nother varieties. Like the others, their nests are made of sticks\r\nplastered together with mud and lined with weeds and rootlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n478d. QUEEN CHARLOTTE JAY. _Cyanocitta stelleri carlottæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n479. FLORIDA JAY. _Aphelocoma cyanea._\r\n\r\nRange.--Locally distributed in Florida.\r\n\r\nAll the birds of this genus have no crests or decided markings, are\r\nwhite or grayish below, and more or less intense blue above, with the\r\nback grayish or brownish blue. This species is 11.5 inches long, has a\r\npale blue crown and a nearly white forehead. It has a very limited\r\ndistribution, being confined chiefly to the coast districts of middle\r\nFlorida, and very abundant in some localities and rare in adjoining\r\nones. They build shallow structures of small sticks and weeds lined with\r\nfine rootlets and placed at low elevations in bushes or scrubby trees.\r\nThe three or four eggs, which are laid in April or May are dull greenish\r\nblue, marked with olive brown. Size 1.00 x .80. Data.--Titusville, Fla.,\r\nApril 17, 1899. Nest of sticks in a scrub oak, five feet from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n480. WOODHOUSE'S JAY. _Aphelocoma woodhousei._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Rockies and from Oregon and Wyoming to\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThis species has the crown and forehead bluish, and the underparts gray,\r\nstreaked with bluish gray on the breast. It is also larger than the\r\nlast, being 12 inches long. They are very abundant in the Great Basin\r\nbetween the Rockies and the Sierra Nevadas, breeding during April or May\r\nin scrubby trees or bushes at low elevations and generally near streams.\r\nThey lay from three to five eggs of a dull bluish green color, spotted\r\nwith umber and lilac gray. Size 1.08 x .80. Data.--Iron County, Utah,\r\nMay 3, 1897. 4 eggs. Nest of sticks and weeds in a small pine tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 308: Florida Jay.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: 480-487.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 307\r\n\r\n480.1. BLUE-EARED JAY. _Aphelocoma cyanotis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of Mexico north to the southern boundary of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this species are the same as those of the others\r\nof the genus and the eggs are similar but the markings are generally\r\nmore prominent and larger. Size 1.10 × .80.\r\n\r\n\r\n480.2. TEXAS JAY. _Aphelocoma texana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southeastern Texas.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that the eggs of this species differ essentially from\r\nthose of many of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n481. CALIFORNIA JAY. _Aphelocoma californica californica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of California and Washington.\r\n\r\nThis is a very abundant species both about habitations and in low\r\nwoodlands. They are very bold and familiar, stealing everything they may\r\ntake a fancy to, and frequently robbing smaller birds of their eggs and\r\nyoung. They are said to be more tame and familiar than the eastern Blue\r\nJay, thereby bringing their bad habits much more frequently to the\r\nattention of the masses. They nest most often in bushes or low trees,\r\nbut not as a rule, far above the ground. Their eggs are a bright bluish\r\ngreen color, speckled and spotted with brownish and lavender. Size\r\n1.10 × .80.\r\n\r\n\r\n481a. XANTUS'S JAY. _Aphelocoma californica hypoleuca._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe habits and nests and eggs of this lighter colored variety do not\r\ndiffer from those of the California Jay.\r\n\r\n481b. BELDING'S JAY. _Aphelocoma californica obscura._\r\n\r\nRange.--San Pedro Martir Mts. Lower California.\r\n\r\nA darker variety of the California Jay, whose nesting habits will not\r\ndiffer in any essential particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n481.1. SANTA CRUZ JAY. _Aphelocoma insularis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Santa Cruz Island, California.\r\n\r\nThis species is the largest and darkest colored bird of the genus\r\n_Aphelocoma_. It is said to be a very abundant species on the island\r\nfrom which it takes its name, and to have the habits and traits common\r\nto all the members of the Jay family. The nesting habits are the same as\r\nthose of the others, but the eggs are slightly larger, averaging 1.15 ×\r\n.85. Set of three in the collection of John Lewis Childs, taken by R. H.\r\nBeck on May 10, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n482. ARIZONA JAY. _Aphelocoma sieberi arizonæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arizona and southwestern New Mexico south into Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 309: Bright bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: 482--484a--485.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 308\r\n\r\n482a. COUCH'S JAY. _Aphelocoma sieberi couchi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern Mexico, north to western Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n483. GREEN JAY. _Xanthoura luxuosa glaucescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northeastern Mexico and the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species has a bright blue crown and patches under the\r\neyes, the rest of the upper parts being greenish; throat and sides of\r\nhead black, underparts greenish white. This gaudy and noisy bird has all\r\nthe habits common to other Jays including that of robbing birds' nests.\r\nThey build generally in tangled thickets or low bushes, placing their\r\nnests at a low elevation and making them of twigs, weeds, moss, etc.,\r\nlined with fine rootlets. Their four or five eggs, which are laid during\r\nApril or May, are grayish buff in color, spotted with various shades of\r\nbrown and lavender gray. Size 1.20 × .85.\r\n\r\n\r\n484. CANADA JAY. _Perisoreus canadensis canadensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southeastern British Provinces and the adjacent portions of the\r\nUnited States; west to the Rockies.\r\n\r\nThis is the bird that is well known to hunters of \"big game\" by various\r\nnames such as \"Whiskey Jack\", \"Moose Bird\", \"Camp Robber\", etc. During\r\nthe winter months, owing to the scarcity of food, their thieving\r\npropensities are greatly enhanced and they remove everything from the\r\ncamps, which looks as though it might be edible. Birds of this genus are\r\nsmoky gray on the back and lighter below, shading to white on the\r\nthroat; the forehead and part of the crown is white and the nape\r\nblackish. Their nests are placed at low elevations in bushes or fir\r\ntrees, and are usually very different from any of the preceding Jays'\r\nnests. They are nearly as high as wide, and are made of small twigs,\r\nmoss, catkins, weeds and feathers making a soft spongy mass which is\r\nplaced in an upright crotch. The eggs are a yellowish gray color spotted\r\nand blotched with brown and grayish. Size 1.15 × .80. Data.--Innisfail,\r\nAlberta, March 12, 1903. Nest a beautiful structure of twigs, moss and\r\nfeathers in a willow bush, 6 feet from the ground. The thermometer\r\nregistered 32 below zero the day the eggs were taken.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN JAY. _Perisoreus canadensis capitalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountains from Montana to Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis variety has the whole crown white and only a small amount of\r\nblackish on the nape. Its nesting habits and eggs are precisely like\r\nthose of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n484b. ALASKA JAY. _Perisoreus canadensis fumifrons._\r\n\r\nRange.--Alaska.\r\n\r\nA very similar bird to the Canada Jay but with the forehead yellowish or\r\nduller; the nests and eggs are like those of the others of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n484c. LABRADOR JAY. _Perisoreus canadensis nigricapillus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Labrador.\r\n\r\nThis is a darker variety of the Canada Jay. Its eggs cannot be\r\ndistinguished from those of any of the others of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n485. Oregon Jay. _Perisoreus obscurus obscurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountain ranges from northern California to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThese birds are very similar to _canadensis_ but have the whole\r\nunderparts white. Like the Canada Jays they appear to be wholly fearless\r\nand pay little or no attention to the presence of mankind. Their nesting\r\nhabits and eggs are the same as the preceding except that they have\r\ngenerally been found nesting near the tops of tall fir trees. Size of\r\neggs, 1.05 × .80.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 311: NEST AND EGGS OF CANADA JAY SHOWING CONSTRUCTION.]\r\n[Illustration right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 310\r\n\r\n[Illustration 312: YOUNG CROWS]\r\n\r\nPage 311\r\n\r\n485a. GRAY JAY. _Perisoreus obscurus griseus._\r\n\r\nRange.--British Columbia to northern California, east of the coast\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nThis bird is said to be larger and grayer than the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n486. RAVEN. _Corvus corax sinuatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Rockies and from British Columbia\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThe Raven is like a very large Crow, length 24 inches, but has the\r\nfeathers on the neck lengthened and stiffened. Their habits are similar\r\nto those of the Crow, but more dignified, and they remain mated for\r\nlife. Besides grasshoppers and worms, they feed largely upon animal\r\nmatter such as lizards, shell fish, frogs, eggs and young of birds, and\r\ncarrion. They nest on ledges of high inaccessible cliffs or the tops of\r\ntall trees, making large nests of sticks lined with smaller ones and\r\nhair or wool; the eggs are laid in April or May, number from four to\r\nseven, and are light greenish in color, blotched with umber and drab.\r\nSize 1.95 × 1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n486a. NORTHERN RAVEN. _Corvus corax principalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America chiefly north of the United States and\r\nnorthwest to Alaska; south on some of the higher ranges to Georgia.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like the last but is larger. They are not nearly as\r\nabundant as the western form and are very rare within the United States.\r\nA few pairs still breed on some of the rocky islands off the coast of\r\nMaine; more off New Brunswick and Newfoundland, and they are quite\r\ncommon on the cliffs of Labrador and Alaska. Their nesting habits and\r\neggs are like those of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n487. WHITE-NECKED RAVEN. _Corvus cryptoleucus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and the border of the United States; north to eastern\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nThis small Raven is of about the size of the Crow, and has the bases of\r\nthe neck feathers white. They are very abundant in some localities,\r\nespecially in southern Arizona. Their food consists chiefly of animal\r\nmatter, the same as the large Ravens, and they are not nearly as shy,\r\nfrequently feeding in camps upon refuse which is thrown out to them.\r\nThey build at low elevations in any tree, but preferably in mesquites,\r\nmaking their nests of sticks and lining them with hair, leaves, bark,\r\nwool or anything soft. During June they lay from four to six pale bluish\r\ngreen eggs, generally sparingly spotted or scratched with dark brown and\r\ndrab. Size 1.75 × 1.20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 313: Pale greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 312\r\n\r\n488. CROW. _Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America south of the Arctic Circle; most abundant\r\nin eastern United States; rare in many localities in the west.\r\n\r\nThese birds, against which the hand of every farmer is uplifted, are\r\nvery shy and cunning; as is well known, they nearly always post a\r\nsentinel in some tree top to keep watch while the rest of the flock is\r\nfeeding in the field below. In the fall and winter, large numbers of\r\nthem flock, and at night all roost in one piece of woods; some of the\r\n\"crow roosts\" are of vast extent and contain thousands of individuals.\r\nCrows nest near the tops of large trees, preferably pines, either in\r\nwoods or single trees in fields. Their nests are made of sticks and\r\nlined with rootlets, and the eggs, which are laid in April or May, range\r\nfrom four to seven in number, are a bluish or greenish white, sparingly\r\nor very densely speckled, spotted and blotched with various shades of\r\nbrown and lilac. Size 1.60 × 1.15.\r\n\r\n\r\n488a. FLORIDA CROW. _Corvus brachyrhynchos pascuus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida.\r\n\r\nThis variety has a slightly shorter tail and wings than the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n490. FISH CROW. _Corvus ossifragus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwest coast from Oregon to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis small Crow which is but 16 inches in length, is found only on the\r\ncoast, where they feed upon shell fish and offal. They nest, as do the\r\nRavens, either on ledges or in tree tops. The eggs resemble those of the\r\ncommon Crow, but are smaller. Size 1.55 × 1.05.\r\n\r\n\r\n489. NORTHWESTERN CROW. _Corvus caurinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf coasts, north in summer to Connecticut.\r\n\r\nFrom Virginia southward, this small Crow (length 16 inches) is more\r\nabundant on the coast than the common Crow which is often in company\r\nwith this species. Their food consists of grain, berries, and animal\r\nmatter. Their nesting habits are like those of the common Crow and the\r\neggs are similar and have as great variations, but are smaller. Size\r\n1.45 × 1.05.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: American Crow. American Raven.]\r\n[Illustration 314: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 313\r\n\r\n491. CLARKE'S NUTCRACKER. _Nucifraga columbiana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of western North America from Mexico to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe Clarke Crow, as this bird is often known, is a common resident in\r\nmost of its range. The adults are grayish with black wings and central\r\ntail feathers, the tips of the primaries and outer tail feathers being\r\nwhite. Their tail is short and their flight slow and somewhat undulating\r\nlike that of some of the Woodpeckers. Their food consists of anything\r\nedible from seeds and larvæ in the winter to insects, berries, eggs and\r\nyoung birds at other seasons. In the spring they retire to the tops of\r\nranges, nearly to the limit of trees, where they build their large nests\r\nof sticks, twigs, weeds, strips of bark, and fibres matted together so\r\nas to form a soft round ball with a deeply cupped interior; the nest is\r\nlocated at from ten to forty feet from the ground in pine trees and the\r\neggs are laid early before the snow begins to leave. They are three in\r\nnumber, grayish in color with a greenish tinge and finely spotted over\r\nthe whole surface with dark brown and lavender. Size 1.30 × .90.\r\nData.--Salt Lake Co., Utah, April 25, 1900. Nest placed in pine 40 feet\r\nup on a horizontal branch, and not visible from below. The tree was at\r\nthe upper edge of a pine forest at an altitude of about 3000 feet above\r\nSalt Lake City. The nest was discovered by seeing the parent fly into\r\nthe tree; the next day a nest was found with three young nearly ready to\r\nfly. Collector, W. H. Parker. This set of three eggs is in the oological\r\ncollection of Mr. C. W. Crandall.\r\n\r\n\r\n492. PINON JAY. _Cyanocephalus cyanocephalus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States between the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas,\r\nand from southern British Columbia to Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis Crow-like Jay has a nearly uniform bluish plumage, and is found\r\nabundantly in the pine belts of its range. Their habits are similar to\r\nthose of the Clarke Crow and the nests are similarly built at lower\r\nelevations in pines or junipers. During April or May they lay from three\r\nto five eggs of a bluish white color specked and spotted with brown.\r\nSize 1.20 × .85.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 315: Clarke's Nutcracker.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 314\r\n\r\nSTARLINGS. Family STURNIDÆ\r\n\r\n\r\n493. STARLING. _Sturnus vulgaris._\r\n\r\nRange.--A European species which has casually been taken in Greenland.\r\nIt was liberated a number of years ago in Central Park, New York City,\r\nand has now become abundant there and is spreading slowly in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThey build their nests in all sorts of locations such as are used by the\r\nEnglish Sparrow, wherever they can find a sufficiently large crevice or\r\nopening; less often they build their nests in trees, making them of\r\nstraw, twigs and trash. They lay from four to six pale bluish green\r\neggs; size 1.15 × .85. Two broods are reared in a season.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKBIRDS, ORIOLES, ETC. Family ICTERIDÆ\r\n\r\n494. BOBOLINK. _Dolichonyx oryzivorus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from New Jersey north to Nova\r\nScotia and Manitoba, and west to Utah and Nevada; winters in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThis black and white bird is well known in the east, where his sweet,\r\nwild music, often uttered on the wing, is much admired. He sings all day\r\nlong during May and June to his Sparrow-like mate, who is sitting on her\r\nnest concealed in the meadow grass. They are quite sociable birds and\r\nseveral pairs often nest in the same field, generally a damp meadow; the\r\nnests are hollows in the ground, lined with grass and frequently with\r\nthe top slightly arched to conceal the eggs, which are grayish white,\r\nclouded, spotted and blotched with brownish, gray and lilac; size .84 ×\r\n.62. They number from four to six and are laid in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n495. COWBIRD. _Molothrus ater ater._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America from the Atlantic to eastern California, and from\r\nNew Brunswick and Manitoba southward; winters from the southern half of\r\nthe United States southward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 316: Starling.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Bobolink.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 315\r\n\r\nThese uncivilized members of the bird world build no nests for\r\nthemselves, but slyly deposit their egg in the nest of some other bird\r\nfrom the size of a Robin down, probably the greater number being in\r\nWarblers and Sparrows nests; the eggs are hatched and the young cared\r\nfor by the unfortunate birds upon which they are thrust. The eggs are\r\nwhite, spotted and speckled all over, more or less strongly with brown\r\nand yellowish brown; size .85 × .64.\r\n\r\n\r\n495a. DWARF COWBIRD. _Molothrus ater obscurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States and Mexico, wintering south of our\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like the last, but slightly smaller. The nesting habits\r\nof the two are identical and the eggs are indistinguishable. It is\r\nbelieved that Cowbirds do more damage to the smaller birds than all\r\nother dangers combined, as their young being larger and stronger either\r\ncrowd or smother the other young or else starve them by getting most of\r\nthe food brought to the nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n496. RED-EYED COWBIRD. _Tangavius æneus involucratus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico; north in summer to the Lower Rio Grande in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis parasite is larger than the Cowbird, being 9 inches long, and is\r\nglossy black with brassy reflections on the upper and under parts. They\r\nare abundant in southern Texas where they deposit their eggs in the\r\nnests of other birds, apparently preferring those of Orioles; their eggs\r\nare pale bluish green, unmarked; size .90 × .70.\r\n\r\n\r\n497. YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD. _Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Mississippi to eastern California,\r\nbreeding from the southern parts of the United States north to British\r\nColumbia and Hudson Bay and wintering from southern United States\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nThis large handsome Blackbird with bright yellow head and breast is very\r\nabundant in some parts of the west, where they nest in large colonies in\r\nsloughs and marshes, being especially abundant in the Dakotas and\r\nManitoba. The nests are made of strips of rushes, skillfully woven\r\ntogether and attached to upright cane near the surface of the water.\r\nThey lay from four to six eggs having a grayish white ground color,\r\nfinely specked and spotted with shades of brown and gray; size 1.00 ×\r\n.70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 317: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Cowbird.]\r\n[Illustration: Light blue-green.]\r\n[Illustration: Yellow-headed Blackbird.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 316\r\n\r\n498. RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD. _Agelaius phœniceus phœniceus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Rockies and from the southern British\r\nProvinces southward to the Gulf; winter in southern United States.\r\n\r\nThese birds are familiar to every frequenter of the country, in their\r\nrange; too familiar to many, for the enormous flocks do considerable\r\ndamage to grain fields in the fall. They also do a great amount of good\r\nat other seasons in the destruction of injurious insects and weed seed.\r\nThey breed from April in the southern parts of their range to May and\r\nJune in the northern, making their nests of grasses, woven and twisted\r\ntogether and placing them in bushes in swamps or over water, and\r\nsometimes on the ground in clumps of grass. Their eggs are from three to\r\nfive in number, bluish white boldly spotted, clouded or lined with\r\nblackish brown and purplish. Size 1.00 × .70. The nests and eggs of the\r\nnumerous sub-species are all precisely the same as those of this bird,\r\nso we will but enumerate the varieties and their range. To identify\r\nthese varieties other than by their ranges will require micrometer\r\ncalipers and the services of the men who separated them.\r\n\r\n\r\n498a. SONORA RED-WING. _Agelaius phœniceus sonoriensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--A slightly larger variety found in southern United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n498b. BAHAMA RED-WING. _Agelaius phœniceus bryanti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Bahamas and southern Florida.\r\n\r\nThis species has a slightly longer bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n498c. FLORIDA RED-WING. _Agelaius phœniceus floridanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and Gulf coast.\r\n\r\nA smaller species with a longer bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n498d. THICK-BILLED RED-WING. _Agelaius phœniceus fortis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the interior of British America; in winter south\r\nthrough the Plains to southwestern United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n498e. SAN DIEGO RED-WING. _Agelaius Phœniceus neutralis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Great Basin between the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas, from British\r\nColumbia to Mexico, wintering in the southern parts of its range.\r\n\r\n\r\n498f. NORTHWESTERN RED-WING. _Agelaius phœniceus caurinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from California to British Columbia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 318: Red-winged Blackbird.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 317\r\n\r\n499. Bicolored Red-wing. _Agelaius gubernator californicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast, west of the Sierra Nevadas, from Washington south\r\nto Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe males of this species are distinguished from those of the Red-wings\r\nby the absence of light margins to the orange red shoulders. They are\r\nfairly abundant in their restricted localities, building their nests in\r\nswamps about ponds and streams. The nests are like those of the\r\nRed-wings, and the eggs are similar and with the same great variations\r\nin markings, but average a trifle smaller; size .95 × .67.\r\n\r\n\r\n500. TRICOLORED RED-WING. _Agelaius tricolor._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of California and Oregon; rare east of the Sierra\r\nNevadas.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from the Red-wing in having the shoulders a much\r\ndarker red and the median coverts white instead of buffy. Like the last\r\nspecies they have a limited range and are nowhere as common as are the\r\nRed-wings in the east. Their nests are like those of the Red-wings and\r\nthe eggs are not distinguishable in their many variations, but they\r\nappear to be more often lined than those of the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n501. MEADOWLARK. _Sturnella magna magna._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains and north to Nova Scotia and\r\nManitoba; winters from New England southward.\r\n\r\nThis handsome dweller among our fields and meadows is frequently heard\r\ngiving his high, pleasing, flute-like whistle with its variations; his\r\nbeautiful yellow breast with its black crescent is not so frequently\r\nseen in life, for they are usually quite shy birds. They artfully\r\nconceal their nests on the ground among the tall grass of meadows,\r\narching them over with dead grass. During May or June they lay from four\r\nto six white eggs, speckled over the whole surface with reddish brown\r\nand purplish; size 1.10 × .80.\r\n\r\n\r\n501a. Rio Grande Meadowlark. _Sturnella magna hoopesi._\r\n\r\nRange.--A brighter and slightly smaller variety found along the Mexican\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 319: Dull bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Meadowlark.]\r\n[Illustration: Dull bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 500--501.1.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 318\r\n\r\n[Illustration 320: R. H. B. Beebe.\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF MEADOWLARK.]\r\n\r\nPage 319\r\n\r\n501.1. WESTERN MEADOWLARK. _Sturnella neglecta._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Mississippi and from Manitoba and\r\nBritish Columbia southward, its range overlapping that of the eastern\r\nMeadowlark in the Mississippi Valley, but the two varieties appear not\r\nto intermingle. This variety is paler than the eastern, but the greatest\r\npoint of difference is in the songs, they being wholly unlike, and that\r\nof the western bird much louder, sweeter and more varied than the simple\r\nwhistle of the eastern form. The nesting habits of both varieties are\r\nthe same and the eggs indistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n501c. SOUTHERN MEADOWLARK. _Sturnella magna argutula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and the Gulf coast.\r\n\r\nA very similar bird to the northern form but slightly smaller and\r\ndarker. There is no difference between the eggs of the two varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n503. AUDUBON'S ORIOLE. _Icterus melanocephalus auduboni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis large Oriole has a wholly black head, neck, fore breast, tail and\r\nwings; it is 9.5 inches in length. They are quite abundant and resident\r\nin southern Texas where they build at low elevations in trees,\r\npreferably mesquites, making the nests of woven grasses and hanging them\r\nfrom the small twigs of the trees; the nests are more like those of the\r\nOrchard Oriole and not long and pensile like those of the Baltimore. The\r\nthree to five eggs are grayish white, blotched, clouded, spotted or\r\nstreaked with brownish and purple. Size 1.00 x .70. Data.--Brownsville,\r\nTexas, April 6, 1897. 5 eggs. Nest of threads from palmetto leaves,\r\nhanging from limb of mesquite, 10 feet above ground in the open woods.\r\nCollector, Frank B. Armstrong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 321: Audubon Oriole.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco-photo.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 320\r\n\r\n504. SCOTT'S ORIOLE. _Icterus parisorum._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico north to the adjoining states; north to Nevada.\r\n\r\nThis handsome black and yellow species does not appear to be abundant in\r\nany part of its range. Their nests are swung from the under side of\r\nleaves of the yucca palm or from small branches of low trees, and are\r\nmade of grass and fibres. The eggs are bluish white, specked and\r\nblotched chiefly about the large end with blackish brown and lilac gray.\r\nSize .95 X .65. Data.--Chiricahua Mts., Arizona, June 5, 1900. Nest\r\nplaced on the under side of a yucca palm leaf, being hung from the\r\nspines, about 4 feet from the ground. Altitude 7000 feet. Collector, O.\r\nW. Howard.\r\n\r\n\r\n505. SENNETT'S ORIOLE. _Icterus cucullatus sennetti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north in summer to the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is orange yellow except for the face, throat, fore back,\r\nwings and tail, which are black; the wings are crossed by two white\r\nbars. These handsome birds are the most abundant of the Orioles on the\r\nLower Rio Grande, where their pure mellow whistle is heard at frequent\r\nintervals throughout the day. They generally build their nests in\r\nhanging moss from mesquite trees, turning up at the ends and lining the\r\npocket with moss, or else make a shallow hanging nest of fibres and\r\nsuspend it from yuccas. During May or June they lay from three to five\r\neggs of a white color, spotted (rarely lined) with purplish brown and\r\ngray. Size .85 × .60.\r\n\r\n505a. ARIZONA HOODED ORIOLE. _Icterus cucullatus nelsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico; in summer north to southern Arizona, New Mexico\r\nand California.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like the last but more yellowish. Their nests are made\r\nof a wiry grass compactly woven together and partially suspended to\r\nmistletoe twigs growing from cottonwood trees; nests of this type are\r\nperfectly distinct from those of the preceding, but when they are made\r\nof fibre and attached to yuccas, they cannot be distinguished from nests\r\nof the former variety. Their eggs are similar to those of the Hooded\r\nOriole, but generally more strongly marked and usually with some zigzag\r\nlines. Size .85 × .60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 322: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Hooded Oriole.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 321\r\n\r\n506. ORCHARD ORIOLE. _Icterus spurius._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Plains, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nsouthern New England, and Canada in the interior. Winters beyond our\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nThe adult male of this species is a rich chocolate brown and black, it\r\nrequiring three years to attain this plumage. They nest commonly about\r\nhabitations in their range, usually preferring orchard trees for sites.\r\nTheir nests are skillfully woven baskets of fresh grasses, about as high\r\nas wide; they are generally placed in upright forks and well concealed\r\nby drooping leaves. They lay from four to six bluish white eggs, spotted\r\nand blotched with brown and lavender. Size .80 × .55. Data.--Avery's\r\nIsland, La., May 10, 1896. Nest of grass, lined with thistledown;\r\nsemi-pensile in drooping twigs of a willow. Collector, F. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\n\r\n507. BALTIMORE ORIOLE. _Icterus galbula._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Rockies, breeding from southern\r\nUnited States north to New Brunswick and Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and well known eastern Oriole can readily be identified\r\nby its orange flame color and entirely black head. Even better known\r\nthan the birds, are the pensile nests which retain their positions on\r\nthe swaying drooping branches all through the winter. Although they\r\nbuild in many other trees, elms seem to be their favorites. Their nests\r\nare made of plant fibres and frequently string, and often reach a length\r\nof about 10 inches and about half that in diameter; they are usually\r\nattached to drooping branches by the rim so that they rock to and fro,\r\nbut are sometimes held more firmly in position by having their side\r\nbound to a branch. Their eggs, which are laid in May and June, are\r\nwhite, streaked and lined with blackish brown and grayish. Size .90 ×\r\n.60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arizona Hooded Oriole. Orchard Oriole.]\r\n[Illustration 323: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Baltimore Oriole.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 322\r\n\r\n508. BULLOCK'S ORIOLE. _Icterus bullocki._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, west of the Plains and from British Columbia\r\nsouthward, wintering in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is as abundant in the west as the Baltimore Oriole\r\nis in the east, and breeds throughout its United States range. Their\r\nnests are similarly made and in similar locations, and the eggs are\r\nhardly distinguishable from those of the preceding, but the ground color\r\nis generally of a pale bluish white tint and the markings are usually\r\nfiner, the lines running around the eggs and often making a very\r\nhandsome wreath about the large end. Size of eggs, .94 × .62.\r\n\r\n\r\n509. RUSTY BLACKBIRD. _Euphagus carolinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding from northern New\r\nEngland and the Adirondacks northward; winters in southern United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBut few of these birds breed within our borders, the majority of them\r\npassing on to the interior of Canada. They generally nest in pairs, or\r\nat the most three or four pairs in a locality, building their large\r\nsubstantial nests of moss, twigs and grass, lined with fine green grass;\r\nthis structure is situated in bushes or low trees in swampy places and\r\nat from 3 to 20 feet from the ground. The eggs are laid in May or June;\r\nthey vary from three to five in number, of a pale bluish green color,\r\nspotted, blotched and clouded with shades of brown and gray. Size .96 ×\r\n.71.\r\n\r\n\r\n510. BREWER'S BLACKBIRD. _Euphagus cyanocephalus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Plains, and from British Columbia and\r\nSaskatchewan southward.\r\n\r\nThis western representative of the preceding is of about the same size\r\n(10 inches long), but differs in having a purplish head and greenish\r\nblack body. They nest abundantly throughout their range either in bushes\r\nor trees at low elevations or upon the ground; the nests are made of\r\nsticks, rootlets and grasses, lined with finer grass and moss, and the\r\neggs, which are very variable, are dull whitish, clouded and blotched\r\nwith brownish and streaked with blackish. Size 1.00 × .75.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 324: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Rusty Blackbird. Brewster's Blackbird.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Dull white.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 323\r\n\r\n511. PURPLE GRACKLE. _Quiscalus quiscula quiscula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States from the Gulf to Massachusetts; winters\r\nalong the Gulf.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is commonly known as Crow Blackbird, nests in trees\r\nor bushes anywhere in its range, and on the coast frequently constructs\r\nits nests among the large sticks of Ospery nests. Large pines appear to\r\nbe favorite sites for them to locate their large nests of twigs, weeds,\r\ngrass and trash. They are placed at any elevation from nearly on the\r\nground to 50 feet above it. The eggs range from three to five and are\r\ngreenish white, splashed, spotted and scrawled with various shades of\r\nbrown and gray, and with streaks of black. Size 1.10 × .80. The nesting\r\nhabits and eggs of the sub-species of this Grackle do not differ in any\r\nparticular. Like those of this variety the eggs show an endless number\r\nof patterns of markings.\r\n\r\n\r\n511a. FLORIDA GRACKLE. _Quiscalus quiscula aglæus._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States.\r\n\r\nA smaller variety of the preceding; length about 11 inches. Eggs\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n511b. BRONZED GRACKLE. _Quiscalus quiscula æneus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Rockies, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nHudson Bay and Labrador. Winters in the southern parts of the United\r\nStates. This is the most common and widely distributed of the Crow\r\nBlackbirds and is distinguished by the brassy color of the upper parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n513. BOAT-TAILED GRACKLE. _Megaquiscalus major major._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States; north to Virginia.\r\n\r\nThis handsome bird measures about 16 inches in length, is iridescent\r\nwith purplish and greenish, and has a very long, graduated and hollowed\r\ntail. These Grackles are very abundant residents along the Gulf,\r\nbreeding in large colonies in swamps, placing their nests of weeds,\r\nmoss, grasses, etc., in bushes, trees, canes or rushes, but a few inches\r\nabove the water, while those in trees are sometimes 50 feet above the\r\nground. The eggs are laid in March, April or May, are from three to five\r\nin number, and are a dull bluish or grayish white, streaked, lined,\r\nclouded and blotched with brown, black and gray; size 1.25 × .95.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 325: Dull greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Purple Grackle. Bronzed Grackle.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 324\r\n\r\n513a. GREAT-TAILED GRACKLE. _Megaquiscalus major macrourus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico to southern and eastern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis variety is larger than the last (length 18 inches) and the tail is\r\nvery broad and flat. Like the former, they nest in bushes, rushes or\r\ntrees at any elevation from the ground. The nests are built of the same\r\nmaterials and the eggs are similar to those of the Boat-tailed Grackle,\r\nbut larger; size 1.28 × .88.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINCHES, SPARROWS, ETC. Family FRINGILLDÆ\r\n\r\n514. EVENING GROSBEAK. _Hesperiphona vespertina vespertina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States in the Rocky Mountain region; north to\r\nSaskatchewan; south in winter to Mississippi Valley and casually east to\r\nNew England and the intermediate states.\r\n\r\nThese are dull and yellowish birds, shading to brownish on the head;\r\nwith a bright yellow forehead and susperciliary line, black wings and\r\ntail, and white inner secondaries and greater coverts. They breed in the\r\nmountainous portions of their range, placing their flat nests of sticks\r\nand rootlets in low trees or bushes. The eggs are laid in May or June\r\nand are greenish white spotted and blotched with brown; size .90 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n514a. WESTERN EVENING GROSBEAK. _Hesperiphona vespertina montana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding in the mountains from New Mexico\r\nto British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this variety are the same as those of the\r\npreceding, and the birds can rarely be separated.\r\n\r\n\r\n515. PINE GROSBEAK. _Pinicola enucleator leucura._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from northern New England\r\nnorthward, and wintering to southern New England and Ohio and casually\r\nfarther. They build in conifers\r\n\r\n[Illustration 326: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Evening Grosbeak.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Pine Grosbeak.]\r\n[Illustration left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 325\r\n\r\nmaking their nests of small twigs and rootlets, lined with fine grasses\r\nand lichens. During the latter part of May or June they lay three or\r\nfour eggs, which have a ground color of light greenish blue, spotted and\r\nsplashed with dark brown, and with fainter markings of lilac. Size 1.00\r\n× .70. Pine Grosbeaks have been separated into the following\r\nsub-species, the chief distinction between them being in their ranges.\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of all are alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n515a. ROCKY MOUNTAIN PINE GROSBEAK. _Pinicola enucleator montana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region from New Mexico to Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\n515b. CALIFORNIA PINE GROSBEAK. _Pinicola enucleator californica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Higher parts of the Sierra Nevadas in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n515c. ALASKA PINE GROSBEAK. _Pinicola enucleator alascensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of Northwest America from Alaska south to British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n515d. KADIAK PINE GROSBEAK. _Pinicola enucleator flammula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Kadiak Island and the southern coast of Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\n516. CASSIN'S BULLFINCH. _Pyrrhula cassini._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Asia; accidental in Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\n517. PURPLE FINCH. _Carpodacus purpureus purpureus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the plains, breeding from the Middle\r\nStates north to Labrador and Hudson Bay; winters in the United States.\r\n\r\nThese sweet songsters are quite abundant in New England in the summer,\r\nbut more so north of our borders. While they breed sometimes in trees,\r\nin orchards, I have nearly always found their nests in evergreens,\r\nusually about three-fourths of the way up. The nests are made of fine\r\nweeds and grasses and lined with horse hair. The eggs, which are usually\r\nlaid in June, are greenish blue, spotted with dark brownish; size .85 ×\r\n.65.\r\n\r\n\r\n517a. CALIFORNIA PURPLE FINCH. _Carpodacus purpureus californicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast, breeding from central California to British\r\nColumbia and wintering throughout California.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this darker colored variety are just like\r\nthose of the last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 327: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Purple Finch.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: 515b--517a.]\r\n[Illustration right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 326\r\n\r\n518. CASSIN'S PURPLE FINCH. _Carpodacus cassini._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Rockies, breeding from British\r\nColumbia south to New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the last but the back, wings and tail are\r\ndarker and the purplish color of the preceding species is replaced by a\r\nmore pinkish shade. The nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of\r\nthe eastern Purple Finch; size of eggs .85 × .60. Data.--Willis, New\r\nMexico, June 23, 1901. Nest made of twigs and rootlets and lined with\r\nhorse hair. Collector, F. J. Birtwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n519. HOUSE FINCH. _Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Plains and from Oregon and Wyoming to\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best known of western birds, and nests commonly in\r\nall situations from trees and bushes to vines growing on porches. Their\r\nnests are made of rootlets and grasses and are lined with horse hair.\r\nTheir nesting season includes all the summer months, they raising two\r\nand sometimes three broods a season. The three to five eggs are pale\r\ngreenish blue with a few sharp blackish brown specks about the large\r\nend. Size .80 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n519b. SAN LUCAS HOUSE FINCH. _Carpodacus mexicanus ruberrimus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California. A slightly smaller variety of the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n519c. SAN CLEMENTE HOUSE FINCH. _Carpodacus mexicanus clematis._\r\n\r\nRange.--San Clemente and Santa Barbara Islands. Somewhat darker than the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\r\n520. GUADALUPE FINCH. _Carpodacus amplus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Guadalupe Island, Lower California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the House Finch, but deeper red and slightly larger. Their\r\nnesting habits and eggs are precisely like those of the House Finch but\r\nthe eggs average larger; size .85 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n520.1. MCGREGOR'S HOUSE FINCH. _Carpodacus mcgregori._\r\n\r\nRange.--San Benito Island, Lower California.\r\n\r\nA newly made species, hardly to be distinguished from the last. Eggs\r\nprobably the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 328: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: 518--519.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 327\r\n\r\n521. CROSSBILL. _Loxia curvirostra minor._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, breeding in the Alleghanies and from\r\nnorthern New England northward; winters south to the middle portions of\r\nthe United States and casually farther.\r\n\r\nThe birds are very curious both in appearance and actions, being very\r\n\"flighty\" and restless, and apt to remain to breed on any of the\r\nmountains. They build during March or April, making their nests of\r\ntwigs, rootlets, moss, feathers, etc., and placing them in forks or on\r\nbranches of trees (usually conifers) at any height from the ground. The\r\neggs are greenish white, spotted with brown and with lavender shell\r\nmarkings; size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n521a. MEXICAN CROSSBILL. _Loxia curvirostra stricklandi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountain ranges from central Mexico north to Wyoming.\r\n\r\nA larger variety of the preceding. The eggs will not differ except\r\nperhaps a trifle in size.\r\n\r\n\r\n522. WHITE-WINGED CROSSBILL. _Loxia leucoptera._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern North America, breeding in the Alleghanies and from\r\nnorthern Maine northward; winters to middle portions of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis species is rosy red with two white wing bars. Like the last, they\r\nare of a roving disposition and are apt to be found in any unexpected\r\nlocality. Their nesting habits are the same as those of the American\r\nCrossbill, but the eggs average larger and the markings are more\r\nblotchy; size .80 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n523. ALEUTIAN ROSY FINCH. _Leucosticte griseonucha._\r\n\r\nRange.--Aleutian and Pribilof Islands; south to Kadiak.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest of the genus, and can be distinguished from the\r\nothers by its very dark chestnut coloration and the gray hindneck and\r\ncheeks. Like the other Leucostictes, they are found in flocks and\r\nfrequent rocky or mountainous country, where they are nearly always\r\nfound on the ground. They build in crevices among the rocks or under\r\nledges or embankments, making the nest of weeds and grasses. Their four\r\nor five pure white eggs are laid during June. Size .97 × .67.\r\nData.--St. George Islands of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration 329: Crossbill.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: White-winged Crossbill.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 328\r\n\r\n524. GRAY-CROWNED ROSY FINCH. _Leucosticte tephrocotis tephrocotis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region from Saskatchewan south to northern United\r\nStates and also breeding in the Sierra Nevadas; winters on the lowlands\r\nof northwestern United States and east to Manitoba.\r\n\r\nThe habits and breeding habits of this species are like those of the\r\nlast. The bird is paler colored and the gray is restricted to the hind\r\npart of the head. They nest on the ground in June, laying four or five\r\nwhite eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n524a. HEPBURN ROSY FINCH. _Leucosticte tephrocotis littoralis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Higher ranges from Washington and British Columbia to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like the Aleutian Leucosticte but the brown is a great\r\ndeal paler. The nesting habits and eggs are, in all probability, like\r\nthose of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n525. BLACK ROSY FINCH. _Leucosticte atrata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region of northern United States; known to breed\r\nin Idaho.\r\n\r\nThis species is black in place of the brown of the others; the gray is\r\nrestricted to the hind part of the head and the rosy is rather more\r\nextensive on the wings. Their eggs probably cannot be distinguished from\r\nthose of the Gray-crowned variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n526. BROWN-CAPPED ROSY FINCH. _Leucosticte australis_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds at high altitudes in the Rockies in Colorado; south to\r\nNew Mexico in winter.\r\n\r\nA similar bird to the Gray-crowned Leucosticte but with no gray on the\r\nhead. They nest on the ground above timber line on the higher ranges of\r\nthe Rockies.\r\n\r\n\r\n527. GREENLAND REDPOLL. _Acanthis hornemanni hornemanni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Greenland and northern Europe; south in winter to Labrador.\r\n\r\nThis large Redpoll nests at low elevations in trees and bushes, its\r\nhabits and eggs being similar to the more common American species.\r\n\r\n\r\n527a. HOARY REDPOLL. _Acanthis hornemanni exilipes._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the Arctic regions and winters south to the northern\r\nparts of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis variety is smaller than the last and is considerably darker but\r\nstill retains the white rump of the Greenland Redpoll. Its nesting\r\nhabits are the same as those of the next.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 330: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 523--524--524a.]\r\n[Illustration: 525--526.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 329\r\n\r\n528. REDPOLL. _Acanthis linaria linaria._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds within the Arctic Circle; winters south to New York,\r\nKansas and northern California and casually farther.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the last but much darker, and the rump is\r\nalso streaked with blackish. These handsome birds are often met with in\r\nwinter, feeding on seeds of the weed stems that project above the snow.\r\nTheir flight and song is similar to that of the Goldfinch or Pine\r\nSiskin. They nest at low elevations, either in trees or bushes. The eggs\r\nnumber from three to six and are pale bluish, sparingly specked with\r\nreddish brown. Size .65 × .50. Data.--Mouth of Great Whale River, Hudson\r\nBay, May 16, 1899. Nest in a willow 4 feet from the ground; made of fine\r\nrootlets and grass, lined with feathers. Collector, A. P. Lowe.\r\n\r\n\r\n528a. HOLBOLL'S REDPOLL. _Acanthis linaria holbœlli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arctic regions; south casually to the border of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA slightly larger variety of the common Redpoll. Eggs probably not\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n528b. GREATER REDPOLL. _Acanthis linaria rostrata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in southern Greenland; in winter south through Labrador\r\nto the northern border of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis variety is larger and darker than the common Redpoll. It has been\r\nfound breeding abundantly in southern Greenland, where its nesting\r\nhabits are the same as those of the Redpoll and the eggs similar but\r\naveraging a trifle larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n529. GOLDFINCH. _Astragalinus tristis tristis_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Rockies, and from Labrador and\r\nManitoba southward.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful birds are among our sweetest songsters from May until\r\nSeptember. They are resident throughout their United States range, where\r\nthey breed in August or early in September, being one of the latest\r\nnesting birds that we have. Their nests are located in bushes, at a\r\nheight of generally below fifteen feet above the ground, being placed in\r\nupright forks, and made of plant fibres and thistle down, firmly woven\r\ntogether. They lay from three to six plain bluish white eggs. Size .65 ×\r\n.50. The majority of nests that I have found have been in alders over\r\nsmall streams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 331: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Redpoll.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Goldfinch.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 330\r\n\r\n[Illustration 332: AMERICAN GOLDFINCH.]\r\n\r\nPage 331\r\n\r\n529a. PALE GOLDFINCH. _Astragalinus tristis pallidus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountains from Mexico to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis variety is slightly larger and (in winter) paler than the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n529b. WILLOW GOLDFINCH. _Astragalinus tristis salicamans._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Washington to Lower California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the eastern Goldfinch but back said to be slightly greenish\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n530. ARKANSAS GOLDFINCH. _Astragalinus psaltria psaltria._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, west of the Plains and from Oregon to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species has greenish upper parts and yellow below; the crown, wings\r\nand tail are black, the bases of the lateral tail feathers and primaries\r\nbeing whitish. They are common in portions of their range, nesting in\r\nsimilar locations to those chosen by the common Goldfinch and laying\r\nfrom three to five eggs which are similar but slightly smaller. Size .60\r\n× .45. Data.--Riverside, California, May 20, 1891. 5 eggs. Nest made of\r\nfine grasses lined with cotton; 5 feet from the ground in a small tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n530a. GREEN-BACKED GOLDFINCH. _Astragalinus hesperophilus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico north to the Lower Rio Grande in southern Texas.\r\n\r\nA similar bird to the last but with the entire upper parts and cheeks,\r\nblack. The habits, nests and eggs are identical with those of the\r\nArkansas Goldfinch.\r\n\r\n\r\n531. LAWRENCE'S GOLDFINCH. _Astragalinus lawrencei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of California, wintering along the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nThis grayish colored Goldfinch has a black face and yellow breast, rump,\r\nwing coverts and edges of the primaries. They are quite common in their\r\nrestricted range, nesting either in upright crotches or in the forks of\r\nhorizontal limbs. The four or five eggs which they lay are pure white;\r\nsize .60 × .45. Data.--Santa Monica Canyon, Cal., April 26, 1903. Nest\r\nin a cypress tree 12 feet up; composed of grasses, feathers, etc.\r\nCollector, W. Lee Chambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n532. BLACK-HEADED GOLDFINCH. _Spinus notatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountainous regions of Central America and southern Mexico;\r\naccidental in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 333: 529a--529b--530.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 332\r\n\r\n533. PINE SISKIN. _Spinus pinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds from northern United States northward, in the Alleghanies\r\nand in the Rockies south to New Mexico. Winters throughout the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSiskins are of the size of the Goldfinch (5 inches long), and their\r\ncalls, songs and habits are similar to those of this bird. Their plumage\r\nis grayish brown, streaked with dusky and the bases of the wings and\r\ntail feathers are yellow. Like the Crossbills, they frequently feed\r\nalong our northern borders, but very sporadically. Their nests are built\r\non horizontal branches of pines or cedars at any elevation from the\r\nground, being made of grasses and rootlets lined with hair or pine\r\nneedles, and of rather frail and flat construction. Their eggs are laid\r\nduring May or June and are greenish white, specked with reddish brown;\r\nsize .68 × .48. Data.--Hamilton Inlet, Labrador, June 17, 1898. Nest on\r\nbranch of a spruce, 10 feet from the ground; made of grass, lined with\r\nmoss and feathers. Collector, L. Dicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n534. Snow Bunting. _Plectrophenax nivalis nivalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the Arctic regions, and winters irregularly in large\r\nflocks through the United States to Oregon, Kansas and Georgia.\r\n\r\nThese birds are only seen in the United States in large roving flocks,\r\nduring the winter when they feed on weed seeds on side hills. Their\r\nnests are built on the ground, being sunk into the sphagnum moss, and\r\nmade of grasses lined with feathers. Their four or five eggs are a light\r\ngreenish white, spotted and splashed with yellowish brown and lilac.\r\nSize .90 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n534a. PRIBILOF SNOW BUNTING. _Plectrophenax nivalis townsendi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pribilof and Aleutian Islands, Alaska.\r\n\r\nA slightly larger variety which is resident on the islands in its range.\r\nEggs like those of the preceding; laid from May to July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 334: Pine Siskin.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Snowflake.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand border.]\r\n\r\nPage 333\r\n\r\n535. MCKAY'S SNOW BUNTING. _Pletrophenax hyperboreus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Alaska; known to breed on Hall's Island.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful species is, in summer, entirely white except for the tips\r\nof the primaries and a black spot on end of central tail feathers, thus\r\nbeing very distinct from the preceding, which has the back and the wings\r\nto a greater extent black, at this season. Their eggs probably very\r\nclosely resemble those of the last species.\r\n\r\n\r\n536. LAPLAND LONGSPUR. _Calcarius lapponicus lapponicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in northern North America; winters south casually to New\r\nYork, Ohio and Oregon and occasionally farther.\r\n\r\nThese sparrow-like birds are 6.5 inches long and have a black crown,\r\ncheeks and throat, and chestnut band on nape. Like the Snowflakes they\r\nnest on the ground in moss, but the four to six eggs that they lay are\r\ngrayish, heavily mottled and blotched with chocolate brown; size .80 ×\r\n.60.\r\n\r\n\r\n536a. ALASKA LONGSPUR. _Calcarius lapponicus alascensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwest North America, breeding in Alaska; winter south to\r\nOregon. This sub-species is like the last but slightly paler. Eggs\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 335: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: Norman W. Swayns. NEST AND EGGS OF GOLDFINCH.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 334\r\n\r\n537. SMITH'S LONGSPUR. _Calcarius pictus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in Hudson Bay and Mackenzie River districts and winters\r\nsouth to Texas chiefly on the Plains.\r\n\r\nThis species is of the size of the last but is a rich buff color below,\r\nand the other markings are very different. These birds together with the\r\nnext species are very common on the prairies in central United States in\r\nwinter. They nest on the ground like the preceding species but the nests\r\nare scantily made of grasses and not warmly lined like those of the\r\nlast. The eggs are similar but paler; size .80 × .60. Data.--Herschell\r\nIsland, Arctic Ocean, June 10, 1901. Nest built in a tuft of grass; made\r\nof fine roots and grass, lined with feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n538. CHESTNUT-COLLARED LONGSPUR. _Calcarius ornatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains in the interior of North America, breeding from Kansas\r\nnorth to Saskatchewan; very abundant in the Dakotas and Montana.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species in the breeding plumage has the throat white,\r\nbreast and belly black, and a chestnut collar on the nape. They are one\r\nof the most abundant breeding birds on the prairies, nesting in hollows\r\non the ground either in the open or protected by a tuft of grass. The\r\nnests are made of grasses and sometimes moss; three or four eggs laid in\r\nJune or July; white, blotched, lined and obscurely marked with brown and\r\npurplish; size .75 x .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n539. MCCOWN'S LONGSPUR. _Rhynchophanes mccowni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Great Plains, breeding from Kansas to the Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nThis Longspur which breeds in company with the preceding, throughout its\r\nrange, can be distinguished from it by the small black patch on the\r\nbreast, the black crown, and chestnut wing coverts. Their nesting habits\r\nare the same, and at this season all the Longspurs have a sweet song\r\noften uttered during flight, like that of the Bobolink. Their eggs are\r\nof the same size and similarly marked as the last, but the ground color\r\nis more gray or olive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Smith's Longspur.]\r\n[Illustration 336: Grayish.]\r\n[Illustration: Chestnut-collared Longspur.]\r\n[Illustration: Dull white.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 335\r\n\r\n540. VESPER SPARROW. _Poœcetes gramineus gramineus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from Virginia and Missouri north\r\nto Manitoba and New Brunswick; winters in the southern half of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nA streaked grayish, buffy and white bird distinguished by its chestnut\r\nshoulders and white outer tail feathers. They are abundant birds in\r\neastern fields where their loud piping whistle is known to many\r\nfrequenters of weedy pastures. They build on the ground, either in\r\ngrassy or cultivated fields, lining the hollow scantily with grasses.\r\nTheir four or five eggs are usually laid in May or June; they are dull\r\nwhitish, blotched and splashed with light brown and lavender tints; size\r\n.80 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n540a. WESTERN VESPER SPARROW. _Poœcetes gramineus confinis._\r\n\r\nRange.--This paler variety is found in North America west of the Plains\r\nand south of Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nIts nesting habits are like those of the preceding and the eggs are\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n540b. OREGON VESPER SPARROW. _Poœcetes gramineus affinis._\r\n\r\nA browner variety found on the coast of Oregon and northern California.\r\n\r\nIts nesting habits are like those of the eastern bird and the eggs\r\nsimilar but averaging a trifle smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * ENGLISH SPARROW. _Passer domesticus._\r\n\r\nThese birds, which were imported from Europe, have increased so rapidly\r\nthat they have overrun the cities and villages of the country and are\r\ndoing inestimable damage both by driving out native insect eating birds\r\nand by their own destructiveness. They nest in all sorts of places but\r\npreferably behind blinds, where their unsightly masses of straw protrude\r\nfrom between the slats, and their droppings besmirch the buildings\r\nbelow; they breed at all seasons of the year, eggs having often been\r\nfound in January, with several feet of snow on the ground and the\r\nmercury below zero. The eggs number from four to eight in a set and from\r\nfour to eight sets a season; the eggs are whitish, spotted and blotched\r\nwith shades of gray and black. Size .88 × .60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 337: Whitish.]\r\n[Illustration: McCown's Longspur.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Vesper Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 336\r\n\r\n[Illustration 338: A.

IPSWICH SPARROW. _Passerculus princeps._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds on Sable Island, off Nova Scotia; winters on coast of\r\nSouth Atlantic States. This a large and pale colored form of the common\r\nSavannah Sparrow. Its nesting habits are similar to those of the latter\r\nand the eggs are marked the same but average larger. Size .80 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n542. ALEUTIAN SAVANNAH SPARROW. _Passerculus sandwichensis\r\nsandwichensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds on the Alaskan coast; winters south to northern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nA streaked Sparrow like the next but with the yellow superciliary line\r\nbrighter and more extended. Its nesting habits are precisely like those\r\nof the next variety which is common and well known; the eggs are\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n542a. SAVANNAH SPARROW. _Passerculus sandwichensis savanna._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding from the Middle\r\nStates north to Labrador and the Hudson Bay region.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the last but with the superciliary line paler and the yellow\r\nreduced to a spot on the lores. Their nests are hollows in the ground,\r\nlined with grasses and generally concealed by tufts of grass or weeds.\r\nTheir three to five eggs vary greatly in markings from finely and evenly\r\ndotted all over to very heavily blotched, the ground color being grayish\r\nwhite. Size .75 × .55\r\n\r\n\r\n542b. WESTERN SAVANNAH SPARROW. _Passerculus sandwichensis alaudinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America from Alaska to Mexico.\r\n\r\nA slightly paler form whose nesting habits and eggs do not differ from\r\nthose of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n542c. BRYANT'S SPARROW. _Passerculus sandwichensis bryanti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Salt marshes of California from San Francisco Bay south to\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nSlightly darker and brighter than the eastern Savannah Sparrow and with\r\na more slender bill. The eggs are not different from many specimens of\r\nsavanna; they are light greenish white heavily blotched with various\r\nshades of brown and lavender. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n543. Belding's Sparrow. _Passerculus beldingi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast marshes of southern California and southward.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the last but darker and more heavily streaked\r\nbelow. They breed abundantly in salt marshes, building their nests in\r\nthe grass or patches of seaweed barely above the water, and making them\r\nof grass and weeds, lined with hair; the eggs are dull grayish white,\r\nboldly splashed, spotted and clouded with brown and lavender. Size\r\n.78 × .55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 339: Grayish White.]\r\n[Illustration: Savannah Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: 542b--543.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 338\r\n\r\n544. LARGE-BILLED SPARROW. _Passerculus rostratus rostratus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of southern and Lower California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Savannah Sparrow but paler and grayer, without yellow\r\nlores and a larger and stouter bill. They are common in salt marshes,\r\noften in company with the last species and their nesting habits are\r\nsimilar to and the eggs not distinguished with certainty from those of\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n544a. SAN LUCAS SPARROW. _Passerculus rostratus guttatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nA slightly darker form of the preceding, having identical habits, and\r\nprobably, eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n544c. SAN BENITO SPARROW. _Passerculus rostratus sanctorum._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds on San Benito Islands; winters in southern Lower\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of these very similar subspecies are\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\n\r\n545. BAIRD'S SPARROW. _Ammodramus bairdi_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains, breeding from northern United States to the\r\nSaskatchewan; south in winter to the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nThese Sparrows breed abundantly on the plains of Dakota and northward,\r\nplacing their nest in hollows on the ground in fields and along road\r\nsides. During June or July, they lay three to five dull whitish eggs,\r\nblotched, splashed and spotted with light shades of brown and gray. Size\r\n.80 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n546. GRASSHOPPER SPARROW. _Ammodramus savannarum australis._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Plains, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nA stoutly built Sparrow marked on the upper parts peculiarly, like a\r\nquail; nape grayish and chestnut. These birds are common in dry fields\r\nand pastures, where their scarcely audible, grasshopper-like song is\r\nheard during the heat of the day. Their nests are sunken in the ground\r\nand\r\n\r\narched over so that they are very difficult to find, especially as the\r\nbird will not flush until nearly trod upon. The four or five eggs, laid\r\nin June, are white, specked with reddish brown. Size .72 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n546a. WESTERN GRASSHOPPER SPARROW. _Ammodramus savannarum bimaculatus_\r\n\r\nRange.--West of the Plains from British Columbia to Mexico.\r\n\r\nSlightly paler than the last; has the same nesting habits; eggs\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 340: 544--544c.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Baird's Sparrow.

FLORIDA GRASSHOPPER SPARROW. _Ammodramus savannarum floridanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Central Florida.\r\n\r\nA local form, darker above and paler below than the common species. Eggs\r\nnot different in any particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n547. HENSLOW'S SPARROW. _Passerherbulus henslowi henslowi._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Plains, breeding locally from Maryland\r\nand Missouri north to Massachusetts and Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar in form and marking to the last, but is olive\r\ngreen on the nape, and the breast and sides are streaked with blackish.\r\nTheir nesting habits are very similar to those of the Grasshopper\r\nSparrow, the nests being difficult to find. The eggs are greenish white,\r\nspotted with reddish brown. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n547a. WESTERN HENSLOW'S SPARROW. _Passerherbulus henslowi occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--A paler and very local form found in the Plains in South Dakota\r\nand probably, adjoining states. Eggs not apt to differ from those of the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n548. LECONTE'S SPARROW. _Passerherbulus lecontei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Great Plains, breeding from northern United States to\r\nAssiniboia; winters south to Texas and the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nA bird of more slender form than the preceding, and with a long,\r\ngraduated tail, the feathers of which are very narrow and pointed. They\r\nnest on the ground in damp meadows, but the eggs are difficult to find\r\nbecause the bird is flushed from the nest with great difficulty. The\r\neggs are white and are freely specked with brown. Size .70 × .52.\r\n\r\n\r\n549. SHARP-TAILED SPARROW. _Passerherbulus caudacutus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in marshes along the Atlantic coast from Maine to South\r\nCarolina and winters farther south.\r\n\r\nThese birds are very common in nearly all the salt marshes of the coast,\r\nnesting in the marsh grass. I have nearly always found their nests\r\nattached to the coarse marsh grass a few inches above water at high\r\ntide, and generally under apiece of drifted seaweed. The nests are made\r\nof grasses, and the four or five eggs are whitish, thickly specked with\r\nreddish brown. Size .75 × .55. The birds are hard to flush and then fly\r\nbut a few feet and quickly drop into the grass again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 342: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Henslow's Sparrow. Leconte's Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Sharp-tailed Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 341\r\n\r\n549.1. Nelson's Sparrow. _Passerherbulus nelsoni nelsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the fresh water marshes of the Mississippi valley from\r\nIllinois to Manitoba.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the Sharp-tailed Finch but more buffy on the\r\nbreast and generally without streaks. The nesting habits are the same\r\nand the eggs indistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n549.1a. ACADIAN SHARP-TAILED SPARROW. _Passerherbulus nelsoni\r\nsubvirgatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the marshes on the coast of New England and New\r\nBrunswick; winters south to the South Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nThis paler variety of Nelson's Sparrow nests like the Sharp-tailed\r\nspecies and the eggs are the same as those of that bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n550. SEASIDE SPARROW. _Passerherbulus maritimus maritimus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Atlantic coast, breeding from southern New England to Carolina\r\nand wintering farther south.\r\n\r\nThis sharp-tailed Finch is uniform grayish above and light streaked with\r\ndusky, below. They are very abundant in the breeding range, where they\r\nnest in marshes in company with caudacutus. Their nests are the same as\r\nthose of that species and the eggs similar but slightly larger. Size .80\r\nx .60. Data.--Smith Island, Va., May 20, 1900. Nest situated in tall\r\ngrass near shore; made of dried grass and seaweed. Collector, H. W.\r\nBailey.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this genus have a habit of fluttering out over the\r\nwater, and then gliding back to their perch on the grass, on set wings,\r\nmeanwhile uttering a strange rasping song. The nesting habits and eggs\r\nof all the subspecies are precisely like those of this variety, and they\r\nall occasionally arch their nests over, leaving an entrance on the side.\r\n\r\n\r\n550a. SCOTT'S SEASIDE SPARROW. _Passerherbulus maritimus peninsulœ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coasts of Florida and north to South Carolina. Above blackish\r\nstreaked with brownish gray; below heavily streaked with black.\r\n\r\n\r\n550b. TEXAS SEASIDE SPARROW. _Passerherbulus maritimus sennetti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of Texas. Similar to maritimus, but streaked above.\r\n\r\n\r\n550c. LOUISIANA SEASIDE SPARROW. _Passerherbulus maritimus fisheri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Gulf coast. This form is similar to peninsulœ, but darker and\r\nmore brownish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 343: Seaside Sparrow. Dusky Seaside Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 342\r\n\r\n550d. MACGILLIVRAY'S SEASIDE SPARROW. _Passerherbulus maritimus\r\nmacgillivrai._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of South Carolina. Like fisheri but grayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n551. DUSKY SEASIDE SPARROW. _Passerherbulus nigrescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Marshes of Indian River near Titusville, Florida.\r\n\r\nThis species is the darkest of the genus, both above and below, being\r\nnearly black on the upperparts. Their habits are like those of the\r\nothers and the eggs are not likely to differ.\r\n\r\n\r\n552. LARK SPARROW. _Chondestes grammacus grammacus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mississippi Valley from the Plains to Illinois and casually\r\nfarther east, and from Manitoba to Texas; winters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis handsome Sparrow has the sides of the crown and ear patches\r\nchestnut, and the sides of the throat and a spot on the breast, black.\r\nThey are sweet singers and very welcome birds in their range, where they\r\nare quite abundant. Their nests are generally placed on the ground in\r\nthe midst of or under a clump of weeds or tuft of grass, but sometimes\r\nin bushes or even trees; they are made of grasses and weeds and the\r\neggs, which are usually laid in May, are white marked chiefly about the\r\nlarge end with blackish zigzag lines and spots. Size .80 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n552a. WESTERN LARK SPARROW. _Chondestes grammacus strigatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Plains; breeds from British Columbia\r\nto Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis paler and duller colored variety is common on the Pacific coast;\r\nits habits and nests and eggs are like those of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n553. HARRIS'S SPARROW. _Zonotrichia querula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mississippi Valley, chiefly west, breeding in Manitoba and\r\nSaskatchewan, the exact range being unknown.\r\n\r\nAlthough the birds are abundant during migrations, they seem to suddenly\r\nand strangely disappear during the breeding season. Supposed nests have\r\nbeen found a few inches above the ground in clumps of grass, the eggs\r\nbeing whitish, thickly spotted with shades of brown. Size .85 × .65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 344: Lark Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Whitish.]\r\n[Illustration: Harris's Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 343\r\n\r\n554. WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW. _Zonotrichia leucophrys leucophrys._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America breeding abundantly in Labrador and about Hudson\r\nBay, and casually in northern New England and in western United States\r\nin the Rockies and Sierras.\r\n\r\nWinters along our Mexican border and southward. A handsome species with\r\na broad white crown bordered on either side by black, and with a white\r\nsuperciliary line and black lores; the underparts are uniform grayish\r\nwhite. These birds appear to be nowhere as common as the White-throated\r\nSparrows with which they associate during migrations and in the breeding\r\ngrounds. They build on the ground, generally near the edges of woods or\r\nin clearings, and lay from four to six eggs similar but larger, and with\r\nas much variation in markings as those of the Song Sparrow; pale\r\ngreenish blue, spotted and splashed with reddish brown and grayish. Size\r\n.90 × .65. Data.--Nachook, Labrador, June 10, 1897. Nest of fine grasses\r\non the ground in a clump of grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n554a. GAMBEL'S SPARROW. _Zonotrichia leucophrys gambeli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountains and westward from Mexico to Alaska, breeding\r\nchiefly north of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis bird is like the last but the lores are white. Its nesting habits\r\nand eggs cannot be distinguished from those of the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n554b. NUTTALL'S SPARROW. _Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from British Columbia to Lower California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the last but smaller and browner above; nests on the ground\r\nor in bushes, the eggs not being distinguishable from those of the other\r\nWhite-crowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n557. GOLDEN-CROWNED SPARROW. _Zonotrichia coronata_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Mexico to Alaska, breeding chiefly north of\r\nour borders.\r\n\r\nThis species has the crown yellow, bordered by black on the sides. Their\r\nhabits are like those of the White-crowned Sparrows, they feeding upon\r\nthe ground among the dead leaves, and usually being found in flocks and\r\noften accompanied by many of the last species. They nest upon the ground\r\nor in low bushes, and in May or June lay three or four eggs very similar\r\nto the last. Size .90 × .65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 345: Pale greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: White-crowned Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: 554a--557.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 344\r\n\r\n[Illustration 346: CHIPPING SPARROW.]\r\n\r\nPage 345\r\n\r\n558. WHITE-THROATED SPARROW. _Zonotrichia albicollis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains and breeding from the northern\r\ntier of states northward; winters from the Middle States southward.\r\n\r\nTo my mind this is the most beautiful of Sparrows, with its bright and\r\nsoftly blended plumage and the pure white throat boldly contrasting with\r\nits grayish breast and sides of the head; the lores are adorned with a\r\nbright yellow spot. They are one of the most abundant of Sparrows in the\r\neast during migrations and their musical piping whistle is heard from\r\nhedge and wood. They nest most abundantly north of our borders, laying\r\ntheir three or four eggs in grass lined hollows in the ground, or more\r\nrarely in nests in bushes. The eggs are white or bluish white, thickly\r\nspotted with several shades of brown. Size .85 × .62. They nest most\r\noften in thickets or on the edge of swamps, in just such places as they\r\nare met with on their migrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n559. TREE SPARROW. _Spizella monticola monticola._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding north of the United\r\nStates to the Arctic coast, east of the Rockies; winters within the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nA larger bird but somewhat resembling the common Chipping Sparrow, but\r\nbrowner above, with a black spot on the breast and no black on the head.\r\nThey are quite hardy birds and winter in many of the northern states\r\nwhere they may be found in flocks upon the snow, feeding on seeds of\r\nprotruding weeds. They breed very abundantly in Labrador and about\r\nHudson Bay, placing their green nests in hollows on the ground or moss;\r\ntheir three or four eggs are greenish white, abundantly speckled all\r\nover the surface with reddish brown. Size .80 × .55. Data.--Foothills of\r\nBlack Mountains, McKenzie River, Arctic America, June 13, 1899. Nest on\r\nthe ground under a tuft of grass on level plain; made of grasses and\r\nmoss and lined with feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n559a. WESTERN TREE SPARROW. _Spizella monticola ochracea._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Plains, breeding in Alaska and\r\nwintering to Mexico. A paler form of the last, the nesting habits and\r\neggs of which are the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n560. CHIPPING SPARROW. _Spizella passerina passerina._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding from the Gulf to the\r\ninterior of Canada and Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 347: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White-throated Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Tree Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 346\r\n\r\nAs indicated by their name _socialis_, Chipping Sparrows are sociable\r\nbirds not only with others of the bird tribe, but with man. In all\r\nlocalities that are not overrun with English Sparrows, you will find\r\nthese confiding birds nesting in trees and shrubs in the yard and in\r\nvines from porches, while in orchards, nearly every tree has its tenant.\r\nThey are smaller birds than the last (5.5 in. long) and have the brown\r\ncrown bordered by blackish and a black line through the eye. Their\r\nnests, which may be found at any height from the ground and in any kind\r\nof a tree or shrub, are made of fine grass and weed stems, lined with\r\nhair; their three to five eggs are a handsome greenish blue, sparingly\r\nspecked chiefly about the large end with blackish brown and purplish.\r\nSize .70 × .52.\r\n\r\n\r\n560a. WESTERN CHIPPING SPARROW. _Spizella passerina arizonæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, chiefly west of the Rockies, from Mexico\r\nto Alaska; winters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis variety is much duller colored than the last and has but little\r\nbrown on the back; its nesting habits are the same and the eggs do not\r\nappear to differ in any respect from those of the eastern bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n561. CLAY-COLORED SPARROW. _Spizella pallida._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of United States and Canada, from the Mississippi\r\nValley to the Rockies, breeding from Iowa and Colorado northward;\r\nwinters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese birds can best be described as like the Chipping Sparrow with the\r\nbrown largely replaced with blackish. They breed quite abundantly in\r\nManitoba and Minnesota, placing their nests on or near the ground, and\r\nmaking them of fine grasses. The eggs cannot be distinguished with\r\ncertainty from those of the preceding but average a trifle smaller. Size\r\n.65 × .50. Data.--Barnsley, Manitoba, May 24, 1900. Nest of grass stalks\r\nlined with fine grass, one foot above ground in tuft of grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n562. BREWER'S SPARROW. _Spizella breweri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from Mexico to British Columbia rarely and\r\nchiefly between the Rockies and the Sierras; most abundant in New Mexico\r\nand Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis bird is similar to the last but is paler and more finely streaked.\r\nTheir nesting habits are like those of pallida and the eggs are\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 348: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: 559a--560a.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: 561--562--564.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 347\r\n\r\n[Illustration 349: CHIPPING SPARROWS (The whole family).]\r\n\r\nPage 348\r\n\r\n563. Field Sparrow. _Spizella pusilla pusilla._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nsouthern Manitoba and Quebec; winters in the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nThese are abundant birds along roadsides, in thickets, or on dry\r\nsidehills, where they nest indifferently on the ground or in bushes,\r\nmaking their nests of grass and weed stems. They are the birds, whose\r\nhigh piping song is most frequently heard on hot sultry days in summer.\r\nTheir eggs are laid in May or June; they are pale bluish white, speckled\r\nand blotched with yellowish brown and grayish purple. Size .65 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n563a. WESTERN FIELD SPARROW. _Spizella pusilla arenacea._\r\n\r\nRange.--Great Plains from Mexico to Montana, breeding in the northern\r\nhalf of its range and wintering in the southern.\r\n\r\nA paler form of the last, whose general habits and eggs are the same as\r\nthose of the eastern bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n564. WORTHEN'S SPARROW. _Spizella wortheni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern New Mexico southward through central Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis pale colored species is the size of the Field Sparrow but has no\r\ndecided markings anywhere. It is a rare bird within our borders and\r\nuncommon anywhere. I am not able to find any material in regard to their\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n565. BLACK-CHINNED SPARROW. _Spizella atrogularis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican border of the United States and southward.\r\n\r\nThis slim-bodied, long-tailed species is grayish with a dusky streaked,\r\nreddish brown patch on the back and a black face, chin and throat. Their\r\nhabits are similar to those of the Field Sparrow and their nests are\r\nmade near the ground in bushes, but the eggs are plain bluish green,\r\nabout like unmarked Chipping Sparrows' eggs. Size .65 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n566. WHITE-WINGED JUNCO. _Junco aikeni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the Black Hills of Dakota and Wyoming; winters in\r\nColorado and casually to Kansas.\r\n\r\nThis species is like the next but larger and with the wings crossed by\r\ntwo white bars. Its habits are like those of the common Juncos, the\r\nnests are placed on the ground, concealed under overhanging rocks or\r\ntufts of grass, and the eggs are like those often seen of the\r\nSlate-colored Junco; 3 or 4 in number, pinkish white specked and spotted\r\nwith light reddish brown. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 350: Field Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: White-winged Junco.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 349\r\n\r\n567. SLATE-COLORED JUNCO. _Junco hyemalis hyemalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding in the northern tier\r\nof states and northward; winters in southern United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is slaty gray on the head, neck, breast, flanks, back,\r\nwings and central tail feathers; the rest of the underparts are white,\r\nsharply defined against the gray. They migrate through the United States\r\nin large flocks, usually accompanied by White-throated or Fox Sparrows.\r\nThey breed very abundantly in the northern parts of their range,\r\nfrequently in the immediate vicinity of houses but generally on the\r\nedges of clearings, etc., placing their nests on the ground and\r\ngenerally partially concealed by rocks, stumps, sods or logs; the nests\r\nare made of grasses, lined with hair, and the four or five eggs are\r\nwhite or greenish white, variously speckled with reddish brown either\r\nover the entire surface or in a wreath about the large end. Size .80 ×\r\n.55.\r\n\r\n\r\n567a. OREGON JUNCO. _Junco hyemalis oreganus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from California to Alaska, breeding north of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is entirely unlike the preceding, having a black head,\r\nneck, throat, breast, wings and tail, and brown back; the remainder of\r\nthe underparts are white, washed with pinkish brown on the sides. The\r\nhabits and nesting habits of this western Junco are the same as those of\r\nthe eastern, the birds building in similar localities and making the\r\nnests of the same material. There appears to be little, if any,\r\ndifference between the eggs of the two varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n567b. SHUFELDT'S JUNCO. _Junco hyemalis counectens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast breeding from Oregon to British Columbia and\r\nwintering south to the Mexican boundary.\r\n\r\nSaid to be slightly larger and duller colored than the Oregon Junco;\r\neggs the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n567c. THURBER'S JUNCO. _Junco hyemalis thurberi._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Sierra Nevadas from Oregon to southern California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to _oreganus_ but paler and back more pinkish; eggs will not\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n567d. POINT PINOS JUNCO. _Junco hyemalis pinosus._\r\n\r\nRange.--A very locally confined variety breeding in pine woods of\r\nsouthwestern California, about Monterey and Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nSimilar to _thurberi_ with the head and neck slaty instead of black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 351: Slate-Colored Junco.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 567a--567g--567c.]\r\n[Illustration: right hend margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 350\r\n\r\n567e. CAROLINA JUNCO. _Junco hyemalis carolinensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Alleghanies in Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia.\r\n\r\nA slightly larger bird than the Slate-colored Junco and with the bill\r\nhorn color instead of pinkish white. They have been found to breed very\r\nabundantly in the higher ranges of the Carolinas, nesting under banks,\r\nin tufts of grass, or occasionally in small bushes, in fact in such\r\nlocations as are used by hyemalis. Their eggs which are laid during May,\r\nJune or July (probably two broods being raised) are similar to those of\r\nthe Slate-colored species but slightly larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n567f. MONTANA JUNCO. _Junco hyemalis montanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--From northern Idaho and Montana north to Alberta; winters south\r\nto Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like _mearnsi_ but darker on the head and throat and\r\nwith less pink on the sides.

Size\r\n.80 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n570. ARIZONA JUNCO. _Junco phæonotus palliatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of western Mexico north to southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the preceding species but upper mandible blackish and the\r\ngray on throat shading insensibly into the grayish white underparts.\r\nThey are quite abundant in the higher ranges of southern Arizona, where\r\nthey breed, placing their nests on the ground in similar locations to\r\nthose chosen by other Juncos; the three or four eggs are greenish white,\r\nfinely speckled chiefly about the large end with reddish brown. Size .76\r\n× .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n570a. RED-BACKED JUNCO. _Junco phæonotus dorsalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the mountains of New Mexico and Arizona and southward.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like the last but the reddish brown on the back does not\r\nextend to the coverts or wings. The nesting habits are like those of the\r\nlast but the eggs are only minutely specked about the large end.\r\n\r\n\r\n570b. GRAY-HEADED JUNCO. _Junco phæonotus caniceps._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region from Wyoming south to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the Slate-colored Junco but has a reddish\r\nbrown patch on the back. They nest on the ground in mountainous regions,\r\nconcealing the nests in tufts of grass or under logs, stones, etc. The\r\neggs are creamy or bluish white, specked over the whole surface, but\r\nmost numerously about the larger end with reddish brown. Size .75 × .60.\r\nData.--Custer Co., Colo., June 4, 1897. Slight nest of small rootlets\r\nand fine grass placed under a tuft of grass. Altitude over 8,000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 352: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 570b--571--572.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 351\r\n\r\n571. BAIRD'S JUNCO. _Junco bairdi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis gray headed species with rusty back and sides is locally confined\r\nto the southern parts of the California peninsula where it is resident.\r\nIts eggs are not likely to differ from those of the Pink-sided Junco\r\nwhich it most nearly resembles.\r\n\r\n\r\n567i. TOWNSEND'S JUNCO. _Junco hyemalis townsendi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of northern Lower California; resident and breeding.\r\nSimilar to the Pink-sided Junco but duller colored; eggs probably the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\r\n572. GUADALUPE JUNCO. _Junco insularis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Guadalupe Island off Lower California\r\n\r\nResembles the Pink-sided Junco but is smaller, darker and duller\r\ncolored. They are common on the island where they nest in the pine\r\ngroves, laying their first sets in February or March. The nests are like\r\nthose of the genus and the eggs are greenish white, finely dotted with\r\nreddish brown at the large end. Size .77 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n573.

This is a common species that\r\nnests on the ground or at low elevations in bushes, making their nests\r\nof weed stems and grasses. The three to five eggs are bluish white,\r\nunmarked and similar to those of the Bluebird but smaller.\r\nSize .72 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n573a. DESERT SPARROW. _Amphispiza bilineata deserticola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States from western Texas to southern\r\nCalifornia, and north to Colorado and Nevada; winters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nLike the last but paler above. An abundant bird among the foothills and\r\non plains throughout its range.

BELL'S SPARROW. _Amphispiza belli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern half of California and southward.\r\n\r\nThese grayish, black and white birds are abundant in sage brush and\r\nthickets, nesting on the ground or at low elevations in bushes, and\r\nduring May or June, laying from three to four eggs of a pale greenish\r\nwhite color, spotted and blotched with reddish brown and purplish. Size\r\n.75 × .60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 353: Black-throated Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: 573a--574.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 352\r\n\r\n574.1. Sage Sparrow. _Amphispiza nevadensis nevadensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Sage deserts of the Great Basin from Oregon and Montana, south\r\nto Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is abundant throughout its range where it nests near or\r\non the ground, in or under bushes and generally concealed from view. The\r\nnests are made of grass and sage bark lined with fine grass; the eggs\r\nare like those of the last species, greenish white, spotted and blotched\r\nwith shades of brown and purplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n574.1a. GRAY SAGE SPARROW. _Amphispiza nevadensis cinerea._\r\n\r\nRange.--A smaller and paler variety found in Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe nests and eggs of this pale variety probably do not differ in any\r\nrespect from those of the better known varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n575. PINE-WOODS SPARROW. _Peucæa æstivalis æstivalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and southern Georgia.\r\n\r\nThese birds are common in restricted localities in their range, nesting\r\non the ground under bushes or shrubs; the nests are made of grasses and\r\nthe four or five eggs are pure white with a slight gloss.

BACHMAN'S SPARROW. _Peucæa æstivalis bachmani._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States; north to Indiana and Illinois.\r\n\r\nThis variety is common in most localities in its range, frequenting pine\r\nwoods and barrens chiefly, and nesting on the ground in May or June.\r\nTheir nests are made of grasses and lined with very fine grass, and have\r\nthe tops completely arched over leaving a small entrance on the side.\r\nThe eggs are pure white with a slight gloss and measure .75 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n576. BOTTERI'S SPARROW. _Peucæa botterii._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican plateau north to southern Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\r\n\r\nThey nest in abundance in tall grass in the lowlands of their range, the\r\nnests being difficult to find because the bird flushes with great\r\ndifficulty. The nests are on the ground, made of grass, and the three to\r\nfive eggs are pure white, measuring .75 × .60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 354: 574.1--576.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 353\r\n\r\n578. CASSIN'S SPARROWS. _Peucæa cassini._\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains and valleys from Texas and Arizona north to Kansas and\r\nNevada.\r\n\r\nThese birds breed in numbers on the arid plains, placing their grass\r\nnests on the ground at the foot of small bushes or concealed in tufts of\r\ngrass, and during May lay four pure white eggs which are of the same\r\nsize and indistinguishable from those of others of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n579. RUFOUS-WINGED SPARROW. _Aimophila carpalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains of western Mexico and north to southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis pale colored bird bears a remote resemblance to the Tree Sparrow.\r\nThey nest commonly in dry arid regions, placing their nests at low\r\nelevations in bushes or cacti, preferably young mesquites, and making\r\nthem of coarse grass lined with finer. Two broods are raised a season\r\nand from May to August sets of four or five plain bluish white eggs may\r\nbe found. Size .75 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n580. RUFOUS-CROWNED SPARROW. _Aimophila ruficeps ruficeps._\r\n\r\nRange.--Local in southern half of California and in Lower California.\r\n\r\nA brownish colored species both above and below, which is found on\r\nmountains and hillsides in restricted localities. They nest on the\r\nground placing their grass structures in hollows, usually at the foot of\r\na small bush or shrub and well concealed. They lay from three to five\r\npale bluish white eggs. Size .80 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n580a. SCOTT'S SPARROW. _Aimophila ruficeps scotti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Texas, New Mexico and Arizona south in Mexico.\r\n\r\nA paler species, above, than the last, and whitish below. It is quite a\r\ncommon species on the mountain ranges where it nests on the ground, in\r\nclumps of grass or beneath shrubs or overhanging rocks; the nests are\r\nmade of grasses and weeds scantily put together. The eggs are white,\r\nuntinted. Size .80 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n580b. ROCK SPARROW. _Aimophila ruficeps eremæca._\r\n\r\nRange.--Middle and southern Texas and south in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis variety frequents rocky mountain sides where it nests abundantly\r\nunder rocks or at the foot of shrubs, the nests being made of coarse\r\ngrasses loosely twisted together and lined with finer grass. The birds\r\nare shy and skulk off through the underbrush upon the approach of anyone\r\nso that the nests are quite difficult to find. The three to five eggs\r\nare pure white and of the same size as those of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n580c. LAGUNA SPARROW. _Aimophila ruficeps sororia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe nests and eggs of this very similar variety to _ruficeps_ proper are\r\nnot likely to differ in any particular from those of that species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 355: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: 579--580.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 354\r\n\r\n581. SONG SPARROW. _Melospiza melodia melodia_.\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains, breeding from Virginia to\r\nManitoba and New Brunswick, and wintering chiefly in the southern half\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nA favorite and one of the most abundant in all sections of the east.\r\nThey are sweet and persistent songsters and frequent side hills,\r\npastures, roadsides, gardens and dooryards if English Sparrows be not\r\npresent. They nest indifferently upon the ground or in bushes, generally\r\nartfully concealing the nest by drooping leaves; it is made of grass and\r\nweed stems, lined with fine grass or, occasionally, horse hair. As is\r\nusual in the case of birds that abound about habitations they frequently\r\nchoose odd nesting sites. They lay two and sometimes three sets of eggs\r\na season, from May to August, the eggs being three to five in number and\r\nwhite or greenish white, marked, spotted, blotched or splashed in\r\nendless variety of pattern and intensity, with many shades of brown;\r\nsome eggs are very heavily blotched so as to wholly obscure the ground\r\ncolor while others are specked very sparingly.

Size .90 × .65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 357: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 356\r\n\r\n583. LINCOLN'S SPARROW. _Melospiza lincolni lincolni._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from northern United States north to the\r\nArctic regions; most abundant in the interior and the west; rare in New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThis bird is shy and retiring and skulks off through the underbrush of\r\nthickets and swamps that it frequents upon the approach of anyone;\r\nconsequently it is often little known in localities where it is quite\r\nabundant. They nest on the ground like Song Sparrows, and rarely in\r\nbushes. Their eggs are very similar to those of the Song Sparrow, three\r\nor four in number, greenish white in color, heavily spotted and blotched\r\nwith chestnut and gray. Size .80 × .58.\r\n\r\n\r\n583a.

Its nests are made of grasses and located on the ground\r\nusually in places where the walking is extremely treacherous. The eggs\r\nare similar to those of the Song Sparrow but are generally darker and\r\nmore clouded and average smaller. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n585. FOX SPARROW. _Passerella iliaca iliaca._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from southern Canada northward,\r\nand northwest to Alaska; winters in southern United States.\r\n\r\nThis large handsome species, with its mottled grayish and reddish brown\r\nplumage and bright rufous tail, is very common in eastern United States\r\nduring migrations, being found in open woods and hedges in company with\r\nJuncos and White-throated Sparrows, with which species their song vies\r\nin sweetness. They nest usually on the ground, but sometimes in low\r\nbushes; the nests are made of grasses and are concealed beneath the\r\noverhanging branches of bushes or evergreens. The three or four eggs are\r\ngreenish-white, spotted and blotched with brown. Size .94 × .68.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 358: Lincoln's Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Swamp Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 357\r\n\r\n585a.

KADIAK FOX SPARROW. _Passerella iliaca insularis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeding on Kadiak Island; winters south to California.\r\n\r\nLike the last but browner above and below.\r\n\r\n585g. TOWNSEND'S FOX SPARROW. _Passerella iliaca townsendi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern coast of Alaska; winters south to California. Like the\r\nlast but more rufous above.\r\n\r\nUpperparts and tail uniform brownish umber, below heavily spotted.\r\n\r\n\r\n586. TEXAS SPARROW. _Arremonops rufivirgatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern Mexico and southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis odd species has a brownish crown, olive greenish upperparts, wings\r\nand tail, and grayish white underparts. They are common resident birds\r\nalong the Lower Rio Grande, being found in tangled thickets, where they\r\nnest at low elevations, making their quite bulky nests of coarse weeds\r\nand grass and sometimes twigs, lined with finer grass and hair; they are\r\noften partially domed with an entrance on the side. Their eggs are plain\r\nwhite, without markings; often several broods are raised in a season and\r\neggs may be found from May until August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 359: Fox Sparrow.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 358\r\n\r\n587. TOWHEE. _Pipilo erythrophthalmus erythrophthalmus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nManitoba.\r\n\r\nThe well known Towhee, Ground Robin or Chewink is a bird commonly met\r\nwith in eastern United States; it frequents thickets, swamps and open\r\nwoods where they nest generally upon the ground and sometimes in bushes\r\nnear the ground. The nests are well made of grasses, lined with fine\r\ngrasses and rootlets, and the eggs, which are laid in May or June, are\r\npinkish white, generally finely sprinkled but sometimes with bold\r\nmarkings of light reddish brown, with great variations. Size .90 × .70.\r\n\r\nTowhees are noisy birds and at frequent intervals, while they are\r\nscratching among the leaves for their food they will stop and utter\r\ntheir familiar \"tow-hee\" or \"che-wink\" and then again will mount to the\r\nsummit of a tree or bush and sing their sweet refrain for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n587a. WHITE-EYED TOWHEE. _Pipilo erythrophthalmus alleni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and the Atlantic coast to South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like the preceding except that the eyes are white\r\ninstead of red. There is no difference between their nesting habits and\r\neggs, except that they much more frequently, and in some localities,\r\nalmost always, nest in trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n588. ARCTIC TOWHEE. _Pipilo maculatus arcticus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Great Plains, breeding from northern United States to the\r\nSaskatchewan.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the eastern Towhee but has the scapulars and\r\ncoverts tipped with white. They nest abundantly in suitable localities\r\nin Montana and North Dakota and more commonly north of our borders. Like\r\nthe eastern Towhee, they nest on the ground under the protection of\r\noverhanging bushes, the nests being made of strips of bark and grasses\r\nand lined with fine rootlets. Their three or four eggs, which are laid\r\nduring May, June or July, are pinkish white, profusely speckled with\r\nreddish brown; very similar to those of the eastern Towhee. Size .92 ×\r\n.70.\r\n\r\n\r\n588a. SPURRED TOWHEE. _Pipilo maculatus montanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds from Mexico to British Columbia, west of the Rockies.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the last but with less white on the back. The nesting habits\r\nand eggs are like those of the Towhee, but in some localities the nests\r\nare most often found in bushes above the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 360: Towhee or Chewink.]\r\n[Illustration: Purplish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Pinkish white.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 359\r\n\r\n[Illustration 361: C. A. Reed.\r\nNEST AND EGGS OF TOWHEE.]\r\n\r\nPage 360\r\n\r\n588b. OREGON TOWHEE. _Pipilo maculatus oregonus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from California to British Columbia; winters to\r\nMexico. Similar to the last but with still fewer white markings on the\r\nback and the chestnut flanks brighter. The nesting habits and eggs of\r\nthis variety differ in no essential particular from those of the\r\npreceding Towhees.\r\n\r\n\r\n588c. SAN CLEMENTE TOWHEE. _Pipilo maculatus clementæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--San Clemente Is. and other of the Santa Barbara group.\r\n\r\nBlack of male said to be duller. Probably no difference between the eggs\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\r\n588d. SAN DIEGO TOWHEE. _Pipilo maculatus megalonyx._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of southern California and Lower California. Said to be\r\ndarker than _megalonyx._\r\n\r\n\r\n588e. LARGE-BILLED TOWHEE. _Pipilo maculatus magnirostris._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California. Similar to _arcticus_; bill said to\r\nbe larger.\r\n\r\n589. GUADALUPE TOWHEE. _Pipilo consobrinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Guadalupe Island, Lower California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to _oregonus_ but smaller and with a relatively shorter tail.\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this species will not likely be found to\r\ndiffer essentially from those of others of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n591. CANON TOWHEE. _Pipilo fuscus mesoleucus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and north to Arizona and New Mexico and casually farther\r\nto Colorado.\r\n\r\nA common species in the valleys and on the side hills, nesting in bushes\r\nnear the ground, and sometimes on the ground; the nests are made of\r\ngrasses, weeds and twigs lined with rootlets, and the three or four eggs\r\nare greenish blue sparingly spotted or scrawled with blackish brown, the\r\nmarkings being similar to those on many Red-winged Blackbirds' eggs.\r\nSize 1.00 × .70.\r\n\r\n\r\n591a. SAN LUCAS TOWHEE. _Pipilo fuscus albigula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis variety is like the last but is usually paler below. It is abundant\r\nin the region about the cape where they nest in thickets, either in the\r\nbushes or on the ground. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those of\r\nthe Canon Towhee.\r\n\r\n\r\n591b. CALIFORNIA TOWHEE. _Pipilo crissalis crissalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of California.\r\n\r\nThis variety is similar to the Canon Towhee but is browner, both above\r\nand below. They are one of the most common of California birds,\r\nfrequenting scrubby thickets, both on mountain sides and in valleys and\r\ncanons, from which their harsh scolding voice always greets intruders.\r\nThey place their nests in bushes at low elevations from the ground and\r\nsometimes on the ground;\r\n\r\n[Illustration 362: 588b--591.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 361\r\n\r\nthey are made of twigs, strips of bark, weeds and coarse grasses, lined\r\nwith fine rootlets. Their three or four eggs are laid in April or May;\r\nthey are light bluish green marked like the others with purplish or\r\nbrownish black. Size .95 × .72.\r\n\r\n\r\n591.1a. ANTHONY'S TOWHEE. _Pipilo crissalis senicula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern California and south through Lower California.\r\n\r\nA very similar bird to the last but sightly smaller and lighter below.\r\nThe habits and nesting habits of these birds are in every way identical\r\nwith those of the California Towhee and the eggs cannot be distinguished\r\nfrom those of that variety. They are fully as abundant in the southern\r\nparts of California as the others are in the northern.\r\n\r\n\r\n592. ABERT'S TOWHEE. _Pipilo aberti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Arizona and New Mexico north to Colorado and Nevada and east to\r\nsoutheastern California.\r\n\r\nThis bird is wholly brownish gray both above and below shading into\r\nreddish brown on the under tail coverts; the face is black. They are\r\nabundant in the valleys of Arizona and New Mexico, but unlike the\r\npreceding species, they are generally wild and shy. They nest in\r\nchaparral thickets along streams, the nests being constructed similarly\r\nto those of the California Towhee, and the eggs are not easily\r\ndistinguishable from those of that species, but they are usually more\r\nsparsely specked and the markings more distinct. Size 1.00 × .75.\r\n\r\n\r\n592.1. GREEN-TAILED TOWHEE. _Oreospiza chlorura._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, chiefly west of the Rockies from Montana\r\nand Washington south to Mexico; wintering in southwestern United States.\r\n\r\nThis handsome and entirely different plumaged species from any of the\r\npreceding would, from appearance, be better placed in the group with the\r\nWhite-throated Sparrow than its present position. It has a reddish brown\r\ncrown, the remainder of the upper parts, wings and tail being greenish\r\nyellow; the throat is white, bordered abruptly with gray on the breast\r\nand sides of head. These birds place their nests on the ground. The\r\nnests are built similarly to those of the eastern Towhee, and the eggs,\r\ntoo, are similar, being whitish, finely dotted and specked with reddish\r\nbrown, the markings being most numerous around the larger end. Size .85\r\n× .65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 363: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: 591.1--592--592.1.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Whitish.]\r\n[Illustration: Green-tailed Towhee.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 362\r\n\r\n[Illustration 364: CARDINAL.]\r\n\r\nPage 363\r\n\r\n593. CARDINAL. _Cardinalis cardinalis cardinalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, north to New York and Illinois, west to\r\nthe Plains and Texas. Resident in most of its range.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful fiery red and crested songsters are one of the most\r\nattractive of our birds, and in their range, nest about habitations as\r\nfreely as among the thickets and scrubby brush of wood or hillside.\r\nTheir nests are rarely placed higher than ten feet from the ground in\r\nbushes, branches, vines, brush piles or trees; they are loosely made of\r\ntwigs, coarse grasses and weeds, shreds of bark, leaves, etc., and lined\r\nwith fine grass or hair. They frequently lay two or three sets of eggs a\r\nseason, the first being completed usually early in May; three or four,\r\nand sometimes five, white or pale bluish white eggs are laid; they are\r\nvery varied in markings but usually profusely spotted, more heavily at\r\nthe large end, with reddish brown and lavender. Size 1.00 × .70.\r\n\r\n\r\n593a. ARIZONA CARDINAL. _Cardinalis cardinalis superbus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern Mexico and southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nA larger and more rosy form of the Cardinal. Its eggs cannot be\r\ndistinguished from those of the eastern Redbird.\r\n\r\n\r\n593b. SAN LUCAS CARDINAL. _Cardinalis cardinalis igneus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nLike the last but smaller and with less black on the forehead; eggs the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 365: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF CARDINAL.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 364\r\n\r\n593c. GRAY-TAILED CARDINAL. _Cardinalis cardinalis canicaudus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThe male of this species is like the eastern Cardinal but the female is\r\nsaid to be grayer. The nesting habits are the same and the eggs\r\nidentical with those of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n593d. FLORIDA CARDINAL. _Cardinalis cardinalis floridanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Florida.\r\n\r\nSupposed to be a deeper and richer shade of red. Eggs like those of\r\ncardinalis.\r\n\r\n\r\n594. ARIZONA PYRRHULOXIA. _Pyrrhuloxia sinuata sinuata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern Mexico and the southern border of New Mexico,\r\nArizona and western Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is of similar form and crested like a Cardinal, but the\r\nbill is very short and hooked like that of a Parrot; the plumage is\r\ngrayish, with wings and tail dull reddish; face and throat, and middle\r\nof belly rosy red. Their habits are the same as those of the Cardinal,\r\nbut their nests are said to be slighter; they are placed in similar\r\nlocations to those of the latter, the two species often nesting together\r\nin the same thicket. Their eggs are like those of the Cardinal but\r\naverage smaller, although the ranges overlap so that the eggs cannot be\r\ndistinguished. Size .90 x .70. Data.--San Antonio, Texas, May 16, 1889.\r\nNest of fine grasses, lined with rootlets; 4 feet from ground in a\r\nmesquite tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n594a. TEXAS PYRRHULOXIA. _Pyrrhuloxia sinuata texana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.\r\n\r\nSaid to be grayer and the bill to average larger than that of the last.\r\nThere are no differences in the nesting habits or eggs between the two\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n594b. SAN LUCAS PYRRHULOXIA. _Pyrrhuloxia sinuata peninsulæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nSmaller than the Arizona Cardinal but with a larger bill. The eggs are\r\nlike those of the others but may average a trifle smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 366: Cardinal.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Texas Pyrrhuloxia.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 365\r\n\r\n595. ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK. _Zamelodia ludoviciana._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Plains, breeding from the Middle\r\nStates and Ohio north to Manitoba and Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful black and white bird with rosy red breast and under wing\r\ncoverts, is one of the most pleasing of our songsters. They nest either\r\nin bushes or trees, generally between six and twenty feet from the\r\nground and usually in thick clumps of trees or scrubby apple trees. The\r\nthree or four eggs, which are laid in June, are greenish blue, spotted,\r\nmost heavily about the larger end, with reddish brown. Size 1.00 × .75.\r\nData.--Worcester, Mass., June 5, 1899. Nest of twigs and rootlets in\r\nsmall apple tree in woods; nest very frail, eggs showing through the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n596. BLACK-HEADED GROSBEAK. _Zamelodia melanocephala._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, west of the Plains, breeding from Mexico north to\r\nBritish Columbia; winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is of the size of the last (8 inches long), and is a bright\r\ncinnamon brown color with black head, and black and white wings and\r\ntail. The habits of this bird are the same as those of the Rose-breasted\r\nGrosbeak and its song is very similar but more lengthy. Their nests,\r\nlike those of the last, are very flimsy structures placed in bushes or\r\ntrees, usually below twenty feet from the ground; they are open\r\nframeworks of twigs, rootlets and weed stalks, through which the eggs\r\ncan be plainly seen. The eggs are similar to those of the preceding but\r\nare usually of a paler color, the markings, therefore showing with\r\ngreater distinctness. Size 1.00 × .70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 367: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Rose-breasted Grosbeak.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: J. B. Pardoe. NEST OF ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 366\r\n\r\n597. BLUE GROSBEAK. _Guiraca cærulea._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southeastern United States, breeding from the Gulf north to\r\nPennsylvania and Illinois, and casually to New England.\r\n\r\nSmaller than the last two species and deep blue, with wings and tail\r\nblackish, and the lesser coverts and tips of greater, chestnut. It is a\r\nfairly common species in the southerly parts of its range, nesting most\r\nfrequently in low bushes or vines in thickets; the nest is made of\r\nrootlets, weed stalks and grasses and sometimes leaves. The three or\r\nfour eggs are bluish white, unmarked. Size .85 × .65. Data.--Chatham\r\nCo., Ga., June 10, 1898. 3 eggs. Nest of roots, leaves and snake skin,\r\nlined with fine rootlets, 3 feet from the ground in a small oak bush.\r\n\r\n\r\n597a. WESTERN BLUE GROSBEAK. _Guiraca cærulea lazula._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States north to Kansas, Colorado and northern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nSlightly larger than the last and lighter blue; nests the same and egg\r\nnot distinctive.\r\n\r\n\r\n598. INDIGO BUNTING. _Passerina cyanea._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Plains, breeding north to Manitoba\r\nand Nova Scotia; winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is rich indigo on the head and neck, shading into\r\nblue or greenish blue on the upper and under parts. They are very\r\nabundant in some localities along roadsides, in thickets and open woods,\r\nwhere their song is frequently heard, it being a very sweet refrain\r\nresembling, somewhat, certain passages from that of the Goldfinch. They\r\nnest at low elevations in thickets or vines, building their home of\r\ngrass and weeds, lined with fine grass or hair, it being quite a\r\nsubstantial structure. The eggs, which are laid in June or July, are\r\npale bluish white. Size .75 × .52.\r\n\r\n\r\n599. LAZULI BUNTING. _Passerina amœna._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding from Mexico to northern United\r\nStates and the interior of British Columbia; east to Kansas.\r\n\r\nThis handsome bird is of the size of _cyanea_, but is azure blue above\r\nand on the throat, the\r\n\r\n[Illustration 368: Blue Grosbeak.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Indigo Bunting.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 367\r\n\r\nbreast being brownish and the rest of the underparts, white. It is the\r\nwestern representative of the Indigo Bunting, and its habits and nesting\r\nhabits are in all respects the same as those of that species, the nests\r\nbeing made of twigs, grasses, strips of bark, weeds, leaves, etc. The\r\neggs are like those of the last, pale bluish white. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n600. VARIED BUNTING. _Passerina versicolor_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico and north to southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThe general color of this odd bird is purplish, changing to bright blue\r\non the crown and rump, and with a reddish nape. They are quite abundant\r\nin some localities along the Lower Rio Grande, where they nest in bushes\r\nand tangled under brush, the nests being like those of the last species,\r\nand rarely above five feet from the ground. The eggs are pale bluish\r\nwhite, three or four in number, and laid during May or June. Size .75 ×\r\n.55.\r\n\r\n\r\n600a. BEAUTIFUL BUNTING. _Passerina versicolor pulchra._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nSlightly smaller but very similar to the last; eggs will not differ.\r\n\r\n\r\n601. PAINTED BUNTING. _Passerina ciris._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States; north to Illinois in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nWithout exception, this is the most gaudily attired of North American\r\nbirds, the whole underparts being red, the head and neck deep blue, the\r\nback yellowish green, and the rump purple, the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the colors being sharp. They are frequently kept as cage birds\r\nbut more for their bright colors than any musical ability, their song\r\nbeing of the character of the Indigo Bunting, but weaker and less\r\nmusical. They are very abundant in the South Atlantic and Gulf States,\r\nwhere they nest usually in bushes or hedges at low elevations, but\r\noccasionally on branches of tall trees. Their nests are made of weeds,\r\nshreds of bark, grasses, etc., lined with fine grass, very much\r\nresembling that of the Indigo. Their eggs are laid in May, June or July,\r\nthey frequently raising two broods; they are white or pale bluish white,\r\nspeckled with reddish brown. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 369: Pale bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Lazuli Bunting.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Varied Bunting.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 368\r\n\r\n602. SHARPE'S SEED-EATER. _Sporophila morelleti morelleti_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern Mexico, breeding north to the Lower Rio Grande Valley in\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar, diminutive Finch is but 4.5 inches in length, and in\r\nplumage is black, white and gray. In restricted localities in southern\r\nTexas, they are not uncommon during the summer months. They build in\r\nbushes or young trees at low elevations making their nests of fine\r\ngrasses or fibres, firmly woven together and usually placed in an\r\nupright crotch. The eggs are pale greenish blue, plentifully speckled\r\nwith reddish and umber brown, and some markings of lilac. Size .65 ×\r\n.45. Data.--Brownsville, Texas, May 7, 1892. Nest of fine fibre-like\r\nmaterial lined with horse hairs, on limb of small tree in open woods\r\nnear a lake of fresh water; 6 feet above ground. Collector, Frank B.\r\nArmstrong. This set is in the collection of Mr. C. W. Crandall.\r\n\r\n\r\n603. GRASSQUIT. _Tiaris bicolor._\r\n\r\nRange.--This small Finch is a Cuban species which casually strays to\r\nsouthern Florida.\r\n\r\nThey are abundant on the island, building large arched nests of grass,\r\nwith a small entrance on the side. They lay from three to six white\r\neggs, specked with brown. Size .65 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n603.1 MELODIOUS GRASSQUIT. _Tiaris canora._\r\n\r\nAnother Cuban Finch which has been taken in the Florida Keys. Eggs like\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\r\n604. DICKCISSEL. _Spiza americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of the United States, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nnorthern United States, west to the Rockies, east to the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\nA sparrow-like Bunting with a yellow breast patch, line over eye and on\r\nside of throat; throat black, chin white and wing coverts chestnut.\r\nThese sleek-coated, harmoniously colored birds are very common in dry\r\nbush-grown pastures and on the prairies. They are very persistent\r\nsingers, and their song, while very simple, is welcome on hot days when\r\nother birds are quiet. They nest anywhere, as suits their fancy, on the\r\nground, in clumps of grass, in clover fields, bushes, low trees, or in\r\nthistles. The nests are made of weeds, grasses, leaves and rootlets,\r\nlined with fine grass, and the three to five eggs are bluish white. Size\r\n.80 × .60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 370: Painted Bunting.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Sharpe's Seed-eater.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 369\r\n\r\n605. LARK BUNTING. _Calamospiza melanocorys._.\r\n\r\nRange.--A bird of the Plains, abundant from western Kansas to eastern\r\nColorado and north to the Canadian border; winters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese black and white birds have a sweet song which they often utter\r\nwhile on the wing after the manner of the Bobolink, all their habits\r\nbeing similar to those of this bird, except that this species likes the\r\nbroad dry prairies where it nests on the ground under the protection of\r\na tuft of grass or a low bush. Their four or five eggs are like those of\r\nthe last but slightly larger. Size .85 × .65. Data.--Franklin Co.,\r\nKansas. 4 eggs. Nest in cornfield in a hollow on the ground at the base\r\nof a stalk; made of straw and weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTANAGERS. Family TANAGRIDÆ\r\n\r\n607. WESTERN TANAGER. _Piranga ludoviciana._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, west of the Plains and north to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is black and yellow, with an orange or reddish\r\nhead. They are common and breed in suitable localities through their\r\nrange, nesting as do the eastern Tanagers in trees usually at a low\r\nelevation, the nests being saddled on the forks of horizontal branches;\r\nthey are made of rootlets, strips of bark, and weed stalks, and are\r\nusually frail like those of the Grosbeaks. Their eggs, which are laid in\r\nMay or June, are bluish green, specked with brown of varying shades.\r\nSize .95 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n608. SCARLET TANAGER. _Piranga erythromelas._\r\n\r\nThese beautiful scarlet and black birds frequent, chiefly, woodlands,\r\nalthough they are very often found breeding in orchards and small pine\r\ngroves. They are quiet birds, in actions, but their loud warbling song\r\nis heard at a great distance, and is readily recognized by its\r\npeculiarity. They nest upon horizontal\r\n\r\n[Illustration 371: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Dickcissel.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Lark Bunting.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 370\r\n\r\nlimbs or forks at elevations of four to twenty feet, making frail nests\r\nof twigs, rootlets and weeds; they are often found in pine trees, but\r\napparently just as frequently in other kinds. Their eggs are greenish\r\nblue, specked and spotted with various shades of brown. Size .95 × .65.\r\nData.--Holden, Mass., May 31, 1898. Nest on low limb of an oak, 4 feet\r\nabove ground; of weeds and rootlets and very frail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n609. HEPATIC TANAGER. _Piranga hepatica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico, north to New Mexico and Arizona in summer.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the next but is darker red on the upper parts\r\nand bright vermilion below. They nest on the lower horizontal branches\r\nof trees, usually live oaks, making the nests of rootlets and weeds; the\r\neggs are bluish green, like those of the next, but the markings appear\r\nto average more blotchy and brighter. Size .92 × .64.\r\n\r\n\r\n610. SUMMER TANAGER. _Piranga rubra rubra._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to New York and\r\nKansas, and casually farther; west to Texas; winters south of our\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nThis bird is of the size of the Scarlet Tanager, but is of a uniform\r\nrosy red color, darker on the back. They are very common in the South\r\nAtlantic and Gulf States. Their nests are located at low elevations on\r\nhorizontal branches of trees in open woods, edges of clearings, or along\r\nthe roadside; the nests are made of strips of bark, weed stems, leaves,\r\netc., and are frail like those of the other Tanagers. Their eggs are\r\nlight bluish green, speckled and spotted with reddish brown, and not\r\ndistinguishable with certainty from those of the Scarlet Tanager. Size\r\n.92 × .64.\r\n\r\n\r\n610a. COOPER'S TANAGER. _Piranga rubra cooperi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding from the Mexican border and\r\nTexas north to central California and Nevada.\r\n\r\nSimilar to but slightly larger than the last. There are no differences\r\nbetween the nesting of this form and the last and the eggs are not in\r\nany way different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 372: Scarlet Tanager.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Light bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Summer Tanager.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 371\r\n\r\n[Illustration 373: SCARLET TANAGER.]\r\n\r\nPage 372\r\n\r\nSWALLOWS. Family HIRUNDINIDÆ\r\n\r\n611. PURPLE MARTIN. _Progne subis subis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds throughout the United States and temperate British\r\nAmerica; winters in South America.\r\n\r\nThese large, lustrous, steely-blue Swallows readily adapt themselves to\r\ncivilization and, throughout the east, may be found nesting in bird\r\nhouses, provided by appreciative land owners or tenants; some of these\r\nhouses are beautiful structures modeled after modern residences and\r\ntenanted by twenty or thirty pairs of Martins; others are plain,\r\nunpainted soap boxes or the like, but the birds seem to take to one as\r\nkindly as the other, making nests in their compartments of weeds, grass,\r\nmud, feathers, etc. They also, and most commonly in the west, nest in\r\ncavities of trees making nests of any available material. During June or\r\nJuly, they lay from four to six white eggs; size .95 × .65.\r\nData.--Leicester, Mass., June 16, 1903. 5 eggs in Martin house; nest of\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n611a. WESTERN MARTIN. _Progne subis hesperia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Washington south.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits, eggs, and birds of this form are identical with\r\nthose found in the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n611.1. CUBAN MARTIN. _Progne cryptoleuca_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Cuba and southern Florida (in summer).\r\n\r\nSlightly smaller than the Purple Martin and the eggs average a trifle\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n612. CLIFF SWALLOW. _Petrochelidon lunifrons lunifrons._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, breeding north from the south Atlantic\r\nand Gulf States.\r\n\r\nThese birds can easily be recognized by their brownish throat and\r\nbreast, whitish forehead and buffy rump. They build one of the most\r\npeculiar of nests, the highest type being a flask shaped structure of\r\nmud securely cemented to the face of a cliff or under the eaves of a\r\nbuilding, the entrance being drawn out and small, while the outside of\r\nthe nest proper is large and rounded; they vary from\r\n\r\n[Illustration 374: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Purple Martin.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Cliff Swallow.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 373\r\n\r\nthis typical nest down to plain mud platforms, but are all warmly lined\r\nwith grass and feathers. In some localities, cliffs resemble bee hives,\r\nthey having thousands of these nests side by side and in tiers. Their\r\neggs are creamy white spotted with reddish brown; size .80 × .55 with\r\ngreat variations. Data.--Rockford, Minn., June 12, 1890. Nest made of\r\nmud, lined with feathers; placed under the eaves of a freight house.\r\n\r\n612.1. CUBAN CLIFF SWALLOW. _Petrochelidon fulva._\r\n\r\nRange.--West Indies and Central America; accidental on Florida Keys.\r\n\r\n\r\n613. BARN SWALLOW. _Hirundo erythrogastra._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America; winters south to South America.\r\n\r\nThis Swallow is the most beautiful and graceful of the family, and is a\r\nfamiliar sight to everyone, skimming over the meadows and ponds in long\r\ngraceful sweeps, curves and turns, its lengthened outer tail feathers\r\nstreaming behind. Throughout their range, they nest in barns, sheds or\r\nany building where they will not be often disturbed, making their nests\r\nof mud and attaching them to the rafters; they are warmly lined with\r\nfeathers and the outside is rough, caused by the pellets which they\r\nplace on the exterior. Before the advent of civilized man, they attached\r\ntheir nests to the sides of caves, in crevices among rocks and in hollow\r\ntrees, as they do now in some localities. Their eggs cannot be\r\ndistinguished from those of the Cliff Swallow. Data.--Penikese Is.,\r\nMass., July 2, 1900. Nest on beam in sheep shed; made of pellets of mud,\r\nlined with feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n614. TREE SWALLOW; White-bellied Swallow. _Iridoprocne bicolor._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of temperate North America, breeding from middle United\r\nStates northward; winters in the Gulf States and along the Mexican\r\nborder and southward.\r\n\r\nThis vivacious and active species is as well known as the last, and\r\nnests about habitations on the outskirts of cities and in the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 375: Barn Swallow.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Tree Swallow.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 374\r\n\r\nThey naturally nest in holes in trees or stumps, preferable in the\r\nvicinity of water, but large numbers now take up their abode in houses\r\nprovided for them by man, providing that English Sparrows are kept away.\r\nThey make their nests of straws and grasses, lined with feathers, and\r\nlay four to six plain white eggs; size .75 × .50. Data.--Portage, Mich.,\r\nMay 26, 1897. Nest in a gate post; hole about 6 inches deep, lined with\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n615. NORTHERN VIOLET-GREEN SWALLOW. _Tachycineta thalassina lepida._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States in the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific\r\ncoast, breeding from Mexico to British Columbia; winters south of our\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nThis very beautiful species is smaller than the last, but, like it, is\r\nwhite below, but the upper parts are blue, green and purple without\r\ngloss. They are common in their range and nest, usually in holes in\r\ntrees, less often in banks and under eaves; the nests are made of grass\r\nand feathers, and the eggs are pure white, four or five in number; size\r\n.72 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n615a. SAN LUCAS SWALLOW. _Tachycineta thalassina brachyptera._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California. Practically the same bird as the last\r\nbut with the wing very slightly shorter. Nesting habits or eggs will not\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n615.1. BAHAMAN SWALLOW. _Callichelidon cyaneoviridis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Bahamas; casual at Dry Tortugas, Florida.\r\n\r\nThis very beautiful species is similar to the western Violet-green\r\nSwallow, as are also its eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n616. BANK SWALLOW. _Riparia riparia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of North America, north to the limit of trees, breeding\r\nfrom the middle portions of the United States northward; winters south\r\nof our borders.\r\n\r\nThis dull-colored Swallow is grayish above and white below, with a gray\r\nband across the breast, they breed in holes in embankments, digging\r\nsmall tunnels from one to three feet in length, enlarged and lined at\r\nthe end with grass and feathers. During May, June or July, according to\r\nlatitude, they lay from four to six pure white eggs; size .70 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n617. ROUGH-WINGED SWALLOW. _Stelgidopteryx serripennis._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, breeding from Mexico north to southern New\r\nEngland, Manitoba and British Columbia; winters south of our borders.\r\n\r\nThis species is slightly larger than the last and similar but with the\r\nthroat and breast grayish and with the outer web of the outer primary\r\nprovided with recurved hooks. They nest in holes in embankments, in\r\ncrevices in cliffs or among stones of bridges or buildings. Their eggs\r\nare like those of the Bank Swallow but average a trifle larger; size .75\r\n× .52.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 376: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 615--616.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 375\r\n\r\nWAXWINGS. Family AMPELIDÆ\r\n\r\n618. BOHEMIAN WAXWING. _Bombycilla garrulus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the Arctic regions except in the Rockies where it\r\nnearly reaches the United States; winters south to the northern tier of\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThis handsome crested, grayish brown Waxwing resembles the common Cedar\r\nWaxwing but is larger (length 8 inches), has a black throat, much white\r\nand yellow on the wing and a yellow tip to tail. Their nests are made of\r\nrootlets, grass and moss, and situated in trees usually at a low\r\nelevation. The eggs resemble those of the Cedar-bird, but are larger and\r\nthe marking more blotchy with indistinct edges; dull bluish blotched\r\nwith blackish brown; size .95 × .70. Data.--Great Slave Lake, June 23,\r\n1884. Nest in a willow 8 feet from the ground. Collected for Josiah\r\nHooper. (Crandall collection).\r\n\r\n\r\n619. CEDAR WAXWING. _Bombycilla cedrorum._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of temperate North America, breeding in the northern half\r\nof the United States and northward.\r\n\r\nThese birds are very gregarious and go in large flocks during the\r\ngreater part of the year, splitting up into smaller companies during the\r\nbreeding season and nesting in orchards or groves and in any kind of\r\ntree either in an upright crotch or on a horizontal bough; the nests are\r\nmade of grasses, strips of bark, moss, string, etc., and are often quite\r\nbulky. Their eggs are of a dull grayish blue color sharply speckled with\r\nblackish brown; size .85 × .60. Data.--Old Saybrook, Conn., June 22,\r\n1900. Nest composed of cinquefoil vines, grasses, wool and cottony\r\nsubstances; situated on an apple tree branch about 10 feet from the\r\nground. Collector, John N. Clark. This species has a special fondness\r\nfor cherries, both wild and cultivated, and they are often known as\r\nCherry-birds. They also feed upon various berries, and frequently catch\r\ninsects in the air after the manner of Flycatchers. Their only notes are\r\na strange lisping sound often barely audible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 377: Dull bluish.]\r\n[Illustration: Bohemian Waxwing.]\r\n[Illustration: Dull bluish.]\r\n[Illustration: Cedar Waxwing.]\r\n\r\nPage 376\r\n\r\n620. PHAINOPEPLA. _Phainopepla nitens_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States and Mexico; north to southern Utah\r\nand Colorado.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar crested species is wholly shining blue black except for a\r\npatch of white on the inner webs of the primaries. Their habits are\r\nsomewhat like those of the Cedar-bird, they being restless, and feeding\r\nupon berries or insects, catching the latter in the air. They make\r\nloosely constructed nests of twigs, mosses, plant fibres, etc., placed\r\non branches of trees, usually below 20 feet from the ground, in thickets\r\nor open woods near water; the eggs are two or three in number, light\r\ngray, spotted sharply with black; size .88 × .65. Data.--Pasadena, Cal.,\r\nJuly 15, 1894. Nest in an oak 10 feet up; composed of weeds and string.\r\nCollector, Horace Gaylord.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHRIKES. Family LANIIDÆ\r\n\r\n621. NORTHERN SHRIKE. _Lanius borealis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding north of our borders; winters in\r\nnorthern half of the United States and casually farther south.\r\n\r\nAll Shrikes are similar in nature and plumage, being grayish above and\r\nwhite below, with black wings, tail and ear patches, and with white\r\nouter tail feathers and bases of primaries; the present species may be\r\nknown by its larger size (length over 10 inches) and wavy dusky lines on\r\nthe breast. They are bold and cruel birds, feeding upon insects, small\r\nrodents and small birds, in the capture of which they display great\r\ncunning and courage; as they have weak feet, in order to tear their prey\r\nto pieces with their hooked bill, they impale it upon thorns. They nest\r\nin thickets and tangled underbrush, making their nests of vines,\r\ngrasses, catkins, etc., matted together into a rude structure. During\r\nApril or May they lay from four to six grayish white eggs, spotted and\r\nblotched with yellowish brown and umber; size 1.05 × .75.\r\n\r\n622. LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE. _Lanius ludovicianus ludovicianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Plains, breeding north to New England\r\nand Illinois; winters in Southern States.\r\n\r\nLike the last but smaller (length 9 inches), not marked below and with\r\nthe ear patches sharply defined. They nest in hedges or thickly tangled\r\nbrush, showing a predilection for dense thorn bushes, where they place\r\ntheir piles of weeds, grasses, feathers and rubbish; the four or five\r\neggs are laid in April or May; they are like those of the last, but\r\nsmaller, averaging .96 × .72.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 378: 619--620.]\r\n[Illustration: Light gray.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Northern Shrike.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 377\r\n\r\n[Illustration 379: I. E. Hess.\r\nLOGGERHEAD SHRIKE AND NEST.]\r\n\r\nPage 378\r\n\r\n622a. WHITE-RUMPED SHRIKE. _Lanius ludovicianus excubitorides._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, west of the Plains, breeding north to Manitoba\r\nand the Saskatchewan; winters south to Mexico.\r\n\r\nLike the last but paler and the rump white. Their nesting habits and\r\neggs are in every respect like those of the Loggerhead Shrike.\r\n\r\n\r\n622b. CALIFORNIA SHRIKE. _Lanius ludovicianus gambeli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast north to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the eastern form but with the breast washed with brownish and\r\nwith indistinct wavy bars. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n622c. ISLAND SHRIKE. _Lanius ludovicianus anthonyi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Santa Barbara Islands, California. Like the last but smaller and\r\ndarker. Eggs not distinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIREOS. Family VIREONDIDÆ\r\n\r\n623. BLACK-WHISKERED VIREO. _Vireosylva calidris barbatula._\r\n\r\nRange.--A Central American species, breeding in Cuba, Bahamas and\r\nsouthern Florida.\r\n\r\nLike the Red-eyed Vireo but with a dusky streak on either side of the\r\nchin. They build pensile nests of strips of bark and fibres, swung from\r\nthe forks of branches. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those of\r\nthe next species, being white, more or less specked about the large end\r\nwith reddish brown and umber. Size .78 × .55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 380: Loggerhead Shrike.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 622a--622b.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 379\r\n\r\n[Illustration 381: YOUNG SHRIKES (All ready for flight).]\r\n\r\nPage 380\r\n\r\n624. RED-EYED VIREO. _Vireosylva olivacea_.\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Rockies, breeding north to Labrador,\r\nManitoba and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis is the most common of the Vireos in the greater part of its range\r\nand is a most persistent songster, frequenting groves, open woods or\r\nroadsides. Their eyes are brown, scarcely if any more red than those of\r\nany other species and I have yet to see one with red eyes outside of\r\nmounted museum specimens. They swing their nests from the forks of trees\r\nat any elevation from the ground but usually below ten feet, and I have\r\nfound them where the bottom rested on the ground; they are made of\r\nstrips of bark, fibre, etc., and often have pieces of string or paper\r\nwoven into the sides; they are one of the most beautiful of bird homes\r\nand are woven so strongly that old nests hang to the branches for\r\nseveral seasons. Their three or four eggs, often accompanied by one of\r\nthe Cowbirds, are laid in May or June; they are white, sparingly specked\r\nwith blackish brown. Size .85 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n625. YELLOW-GREEN VIREO. _Vireosylva flavoviridis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Texas and southward to South America.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Red-eye but greener above and more yellowish on the\r\nsides. The nesting habits are the same and the eggs indistinguishable\r\nfrom those of that species.\r\n\r\n\r\n626. PHILADELPHIA VIREO. _Vireosylva philadelphica_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States breeding from northern New England and\r\nManitoba northward.\r\n\r\nThis species is much smaller than the Red-eye (length 5 in.) and is\r\nyellowish below, and without black edges to the gray crown. Their eggs\r\ndo not differ from those of the Red-eyed Vireo except in size, averaging\r\n.70 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n627. WARBLING VIREO. _Vireosylva gilva gilva._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east to the Plains, breeding north to Labrador.\r\n\r\nThis Vireo is nearly as abundant as the Red-eye but is not generally as\r\nwell known, probably because it is usually higher in the trees and more\r\nconcealed from view. Their nests are like those of the Red-eye, but\r\nsmaller and usually placed higher in the trees. The birds are even more\r\npersistent singers, than are the latter but the song is more musical and\r\ndelivered in a more even manner, as they creep about among the foliage,\r\npeering under every leaf for lurking insects. The eggs are pure white,\r\nspotted with brown or reddish brown. Size .72 × .52.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 382: Red-eyed Vireo.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 626-627.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 381\r\n\r\n[Illustration 383: C. A. Reed.\r\nRED-EYED VIREO ON NEST.]\r\n\r\nPage 382\r\n\r\n627a. WESTERN WARBLING VIREO. _Vireosylva gilva swainsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding from Mexico to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis species is like the last but said to be a trifle smaller and paler\r\ncolor. Its nesting habits and eggs are precisely like those of the\r\neastern form.\r\n\r\n\r\n628. YELLOW-THROATED VIREO. _Lanivireo flavifrons._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Plains, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nManitoba and New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThis handsome bird is wholly unlike any others of the Vireos, having a\r\nbright yellow throat and breast; the upper parts are greenish and the\r\nwings and tail gray, the latter with two white bars. They are fairly\r\ncommon breeding birds in northern United States, placing their handsome\r\nbasket-like structures in forks of branches and at any elevation from\r\nthe ground; the nests are like those of the preceding Vireos but are\r\nfrequently adorned on the outside with lichens, thereby adding\r\nmaterially to their natural beauty. The four or five eggs are pinkish or\r\ncreamy white, speckled about the large end with reddish brown. Size .80\r\n× .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n629. BLUE-HEADED VIREO. _Lanivireo solitarius solitarius._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from southern New England and\r\nthe northern states north to Hudson Bay; winters in the Gulf States and\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nA beautiful Vireo with a slaty blue crown and nape, greenish back, white\r\nwing bars and underparts, the flanks being washed with greenish yellow;\r\na conspicuous mark is the white eye ring and loral spot. They build\r\nfirm, pensile, basket-like nests of strips of birch and grapevine bark,\r\nlined with fine grasses and hair, suspended from forks, usually at low\r\nelevation and often in pine or fir trees (of some twenty nests that I\r\nhave found in New England all have been in low branches of conifers).\r\nTheir three or four white eggs are specked with reddish brown. Size .80\r\n× .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n629a. CASSIN'S VIREO. _Lanivireo solitarius cassini._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Rockies; north to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the last but with the back grayish.\r\n\r\n629b. PLUMBEOUS VIREO. _Lanivireo solitarius plumbeus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region, breeding from Mexico to Dakota and\r\nWyoming.\r\n\r\nLike the Blue-headed Vireo but with the yellowish wholly replaced by\r\nleaden gray.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yellow-throated Vireo.]\r\n[Illustration 384: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Blue-headed Vireo.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 383\r\n\r\n629c. MOUNTAIN VIREO. _Lanivireo solitarius alticola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of Carolina and Georgia; winters in Florida.\r\n\r\nSaid to be larger and darker than _solitarius_ proper. From all\r\naccounts, the habits, nests or eggs of this species differ in no wise\r\nfrom many of those of the northern Solitary Vireo, whose nests show\r\ngreat variations in size and material.\r\n\r\n\r\n629d. SAN LUCAS VIREO. _Lanivireo solitarius lucasanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nSimilar to cassini but with the flanks more yellow. Their nesting habits\r\nor eggs will not differ from the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n630. BLACK-CAPPED VIREO. _Vireo atricapillus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Central Texas north to Kansas; winters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar Vireo has a black crown and sides of head, broken by a\r\nwhite eye ring and loral stripe; upper parts greenish, below white. They\r\nappear to be fairly common in certain localities of their restricted\r\nrange, and nest at low elevations in mesquites or oaks, placing the\r\nnests in forks the same as other Vireos; they are of the ordinary Vireo\r\narchitecture, lined with grasses. The three or four eggs are pure white,\r\nunmarked. Size .70 × .50. Data.--Comal Co., Texas, May 21, 1888, 4 eggs.\r\nNest located in a scrub Spanish oak, 5 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n631. WHITE-EYED VIREO. _Vireo griseus griseus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to northern United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis Vireo has white eyes, as implied by its name, is yellowish green on\r\nthe sides and with two prominent bars. They have no song, like the other\r\nVireos, but a strange medley of notes resembling those of the Chat or\r\nShrike. They nest near the ground in tangled thickets, making large\r\nnests for the size of the birds and not always suspended; they are made\r\nof weeds, leaves, grass, bark or any trash. Their three or four eggs are\r\nlaid late in May or early in June; they are white, sparingly speckled\r\nwith brown; size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n631a. KEY WEST VIREO. _Vireo griseus maynardi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Florida.\r\n\r\nThis grayer and paler variety nests in the same manner and the eggs are\r\nnot distinct from those of the last form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 385: Black-capped Vireo.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White-eyed Vireo.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 384\r\n\r\n631b. BERMUDA VIREO. _Vireo griseus bermudianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Bermudas.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said to be slightly smaller and to have no yellow on the\r\nsides. Its eggs are probably the same as those of the others.\r\n\r\n631c. SMALL WHITE-EYED VIREO. _Vireo griseus micrus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern Mexico north to southern Texas.\r\n\r\nSaid to be slightly smaller and grayer than the common White-eyed Vireo.\r\nIts eggs will not differ.\r\n\r\n\r\n632. HUTTON'S VIREO. _Vireo huttoni huttoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Resident on the California coast; chiefly in the southern parts.\r\n\r\nA similar species to _noveboracensis_ but with the under parts tinged\r\nwith yellow. These birds are quite common but shy, nesting at any height\r\nfrom the ground in open woods or groves; the nests are made of grasses\r\nand moss and swung from forked limbs; the three or four eggs are pure\r\nwhite, finely specked with reddish brown. Size .70 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n632a. STEPHEN'S VIREO. _Vireo huttoni stephensi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northwestern Mexico and the boundary of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis variety, which is more yellowish than the last, appears to be\r\nrather uncommon but as far as I can learn its habits and nesting do not\r\ndiffer from those of the other Vireos; the eggs are white, specked with\r\nbrown. Size .70 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n632c. ANTHONY'S VIREO. _Vireo huttoni obscurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Oregon (and Cal. in winter) to British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this darker and smaller variety are the\r\nsame in all respects as those of the Hutton's Vireo.\r\n\r\n\r\n633. BELL'S VIREO. _Vireo belli belli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of the United States, breeding from Texas to Minnesota\r\nand Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this smaller species are just the same as those of\r\nthe larger varieties, they suspending their small grass-woven baskets in\r\nthe forks of bushes or trees and usually at a low elevation. Their nests\r\nare handsome and compact little structures, being often made almost\r\nwholly of strips of bark lined with very fine grasses. The eggs are\r\nwhite, specked with reddish brown. Size .70 × .50. Data.--Austin, Texas,\r\nJune 16, 1898. Nest of strips of bark, fibres and grasses, neatly woven\r\nand swung from the fork of a low bush, 2 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 386: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 629a--632.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 633a-634.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 385\r\n\r\n633a. LEAST VIREO. _Vireo belli pusillus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico, Arizona and southern California.\r\n\r\nThis Vireo is slightly smaller and grayer than the last; they are quite\r\ncommon in southern Arizona, nesting the same as Bell's at low elevations\r\nin bushes or small trees. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those of\r\n_belli_.\r\n\r\n\r\n634. GRAY VIREO. _Vireo vicinior._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States from western Texas, southern\r\nCalifornia and Nevada southward.\r\n\r\nThis species is grayish above and grayish white below, with white eye\r\nring, lores and wing bar. They are not uncommon birds in the Huachuca\r\nMts. of southern Arizona, where they nest in bushes at low elevations,\r\nmaking the semi-pensile structures of woven strips of bark and grasses,\r\nlined with fine round grasses attached by the rim to a fork and\r\nsometimes stayed on the side by convenient twigs. Eggs white, specked\r\nwith brown. Size .72 × .53.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEY CREEPERS. Family COEREBIDÆ\r\n\r\n635. BAHAMA HONEY CREEPER. _Cœreba bahamensis_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Bahamas, casually to southern Florida and the Keys.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar curved-billed species is dark brown above, with the\r\nunderparts, superciliary line and spot at base of primaries, whitish;\r\nthe rump and a breast patch are yellow. They nest at low elevations in\r\nbushes or trees usually in tangled thickets, making a large dome-shaped\r\nnest of grasses, leaves and fibres and, during May or June, lay from\r\nthree to five pale creamy white eggs, speckled sparingly all over the\r\nsurface and more abundantly at the large end with reddish brown. Size\r\n.65 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARBLERS. Family MNIOTILTIDÆ\r\n\r\nWarblers as a family may be classed as the most beautiful, interesting\r\nand useful birds that we have. With few exceptions, they only return\r\nfrom their winter quarters as the trees shoot forth their leaves or\r\nflowers, they feed largely among the foliage upon small, and mostly\r\ninjurious, insects. They are very active and always flitting from branch\r\nto branch, showing their handsome plumage to the best advantage. Their\r\nsongs are simple but effectively delivered and the nests are of a high\r\norder of architecture.\r\n\r\n636. BLACK AND WHITE WARBLER. _Mniotilta varia._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Plains, breeding from the Gulf States\r\nnorth to the Hudson Bay region; winters from our southern borders to\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nThis striped black and white Warbler is usually seen creeping about tree\r\ntrunks and branches after the manner of a Nuthatch. They are very active\r\ngleaners and of inestimable value to man. They nest on the ground in\r\nwoods or swamps, making their nest of strips of bark and grass, placed\r\namong the leaves usually beside stones, stumps or fallen trees. Their\r\nthree to five eggs are white, finely specked and wreathed with reddish\r\nbrown. Size .65 × .50. Data.--Worcester, Mass., June 3, 1889. Nest of\r\nstrips of bark on the ground in an old decayed stump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 387: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Black and White Warbler.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 386\r\n\r\n637. PROTHONOTARY WARBLER. _Prothonotaria citrea._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States, north in the interior to Iowa\r\nand Illinois.\r\n\r\nThis species is often known as the Golden Swamp Warbler because of the\r\nrich golden yellow of the head and underparts. They frequent and nest in\r\nthe vicinity of swamps or ponds, nesting in the cavities of trees or\r\nstubs at low elevations, filling the cavity with leaves, moss and\r\ngrasses, neatly cupped to receive the four to seven eggs, which are\r\ncreamy or pinkish white, profusely spotted with reddish brown and\r\nchestnut. Size .72 × .55. Data.--Quincy, Mo., June 1, 1897. 5 eggs. Nest\r\nin hole of a dead stub 6 feet up, in timber some distance from water;\r\nmade of moss and grasses, lined with hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n638. SWAINSON'S WARBLER. _Helinaia swainsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States, north to Virginia and Indiana,\r\nand west to eastern Texas; winters in Mexico and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThis species is brownish above and white below, with a whitish\r\nsuperciliary stripe. It has been found breeding most numerously in\r\nthickets and tangled underbush about swamps and pools in any locality.\r\nTheir nests are either in bushes or attached to upright rushes over\r\nwater after the manner of the Long-billed Marsh Wren, being made of\r\nleaves, moss, rootlets, etc., lined with fine grasses or hair, and\r\ndeeply cupped for the reception of the three or four unmarked white or\r\nbluish white eggs which are laid during May or June. Size .75 × .58.\r\nData.--Near Charlestown, S. C., May 12, 1888, 3 eggs. Nest in canes 4\r\nfeet from ground, made of strips of rushes, sweet gum and water oak\r\nleaves, lined with pine needles.\r\n\r\n\r\n639. WORM-EATING WARBLER. _Helmitheros vermivorus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Plains, breeding north to southern New\r\nEngland and Illinois; winters south of our borders.\r\n\r\nThis bird can be identified in all plumages by the three light buff and\r\ntwo black stripes on the crown and narrower black stripes through the\r\neye. Their habits are similar to those of the Oven-bird, they\r\n\r\n[Illustration 388: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Prothonotary Warbler.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Swainson's Warbler. Worm-eating Warbler.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 387\r\n\r\nfeeding largely upon the ground amid dead leaves. They are quite\r\nabundant in most localities in their range, nesting in hollows on the\r\nground in open woods or shrubbery on hill sides; the nest is made of\r\nleaves, grasses and rootlets, lined with hair or finer grasses, and is\r\nusually placed under the shelter of some small bush. They lay (in May,\r\nJune or July) three to six eggs, white, marked or blotched either\r\nsparingly or heavily with chestnut or lavender. Size .70 × .52.\r\n\r\n\r\n640. BACHMAN'S WARBLER. _Vermivora bachmani._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southeastern United States, along the Gulf coast to Louisiana\r\nand north to Virginia and Missouri.\r\n\r\nThis species is one of the rarest of the Warblers, but is now much more\r\nabundant than twenty years ago, when it had apparently disappeared. They\r\nare greenish above, and yellow below, and on the forehead and shoulder,\r\nand with black patches on the crown and breast. They have been found\r\nbreeding in Missouri, nesting on the ground like others of this genus;\r\nthe eggs are white wreathed about the large end and sparingly specked\r\nover the whole surface with reddish brown and chestnut. Size .65 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n641. BLUE-WINGED WARBLER. _Vermivora pinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding north to southern New England\r\nand in the Mississippi Valley to Minnesota; winters south of our\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nThis common species has the crown and underparts yellow, line through\r\nthe eye black, and white wing bars and spots on outer tail feathers.\r\nThey breed most abundantly in the northern half of their United States\r\nrange, placing their nests on the ground in thickets or on the edge of\r\nwoods; the nests are made of strips of bark, usually grapevine, and\r\nleaves, and are usually high and deeply cupped, they are almost always\r\nplaced among the upright shoots of young bushes. The eggs are white,\r\nfinely specked with reddish brown with great variations as to markings.\r\nSize .65 × .50. Data.--Old Saybrook, Conn., June 1, 1900. 5 eggs. Nest\r\ncomposed chiefly of dry beech leaves and strips of cedar bark, lined\r\nwith shreds of bark and fine grass; situated on the ground among a bunch\r\nof weeds in the woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 389: Bachman's Warbler. Lawrence's Warbler. Brewster's\r\nWarbler.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 388\r\n\r\n642. GOLDEN-WINGED WARBLER. _Vermivora chrysoptera._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding north to the southern parts of\r\nthe British Provinces, winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is a very handsome species with black throat and ear patches, and\r\nyellow crown and wing bars, the upper parts being gray and the lower\r\nwhite. They frequent low fields or hillsides where they nest among weeds\r\nor vines, making the nest of strips of bark, grasses and fibres, and\r\nlocating it close to the ground in clumps of weeds, low bushes or\r\nbriers. The three to five eggs are white with a very great diversity of\r\nmarkings, either heavily or minutely spotted or wreathed with chestnut\r\nand gray. Size .62 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n643. LUCY'S WARBLER. _Vermivora luciæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico, north commonly to Arizona and casually to\r\nsouthern Utah.\r\n\r\nThis small gray and white Warbler is especially distinguished by a\r\nchestnut rump and patch in center of the crown. Besides nesting in forks\r\nof low bushes, this species is said to place the domiciles in almost any\r\ncrevice or nook that suits their fancy, such as loose bark on tree\r\ntrunks, holes in trees, or other birds' nests. The eggs which are\r\nusually laid during May are white, sparingly specked and wreathed with\r\nreddish brown. Size .60 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n644. VIRGINIA'S WARBLER. _Vermivora virginiæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico, north to Arizona and New Mexico, and also less\r\ncommonly to Colorado.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the last but has the rump and a patch on the\r\nbreast, yellow. They are found quite abundantly in some localities,\r\nusually on mountain ranges, nesting in hollows on the ground beside\r\nrocks, stumps or in crevices among the rocks; the nests are made of fine\r\nstrips of bark and grasses, skillfully woven together, and the three to\r\nfive eggs are pure white, specked and wreathed with reddish brown. Size\r\n.62 × .50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 390: Golden-winged Warbler.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Lucy's Warbler.

Size .60 × .45. Data.--Worcester, Mass., June 23, 1895. Nest of\r\npine needles and grasses in hollow in the moss on a scrubby pine\r\nhillside.\r\n\r\n\r\n645a. CALAVERAS WARBLER. _Vermivora rubricapilla gutturalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding on ranges from California and\r\nIdaho north to British Columbia; winters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nA slightly brighter colored form of the last species. Their habits are\r\nthe same and the eggs cannot be distinguished from those of the eastern\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n\r\n646. ORANGE-CROWNED WARBLER. _Vermivora celata celata._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, chiefly in the interior, breeding north of the\r\nUnited States except in the Rockies south to Arizona and New Mexico;\r\nwinters in the Gulf States and southward.\r\n\r\nThis plainly clad, greenish colored species has a concealed patch of\r\norange brown on the crown. They have been found breeding about Hudson\r\nBay and in the Mackenzie River district, placing their nests in hollows\r\non the ground, usually on the side of banks or hills and concealed by\r\nsmall tufts of grass or bushes. The three or four eggs are white,\r\nspeckled with reddish brown. Size .64 × .45.\r\n\r\n\r\n646a. LUTESCENT WARBLER. _Vermivora celata lutescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast, breeding from California to Alaska; winters in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the last but more yellowish below. They make their nests of\r\nleaves, rootlets, moss, etc., lined with hair, and placed on the ground,\r\nconcealed by tufts of grass or by bushes. The eggs are like those of the\r\nlast. Data.--Danville, Cal., April 21, 1898. Nest on the ground on a\r\nside hill; among weeds in the shade of a large oak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 391: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Nashville Warbler. Orange-crowned Warbler.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 390\r\n\r\n646b. DUSKY WARBLER. _Vermivora celata sordida._\r\n\r\nRange.--Santa Barbara Islands, off California.\r\n\r\nSaid to be duller colored and darker than the others.

TENNESSEE WARBLER. _Vermivora peregrina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from the northern tier of\r\nstates, northward; winters to northern South America.\r\n\r\nThis species has greenish upper parts, white lower parts and\r\nsuperciliary line, and gray crown and nape. They nest either on the\r\nground or at low elevations in bushes, making the structure of grasses\r\nand fibres, lined with hair; they are found on wild, tangled hillsides\r\nand mountain ranges. The eggs are pure white, sparingly specked with\r\nreddish brown. Size .62 × .45.\r\n\r\n\r\n648. PARULA WARBLER. _Compsothlypis americana americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding in the southern half.\r\n\r\nThe upper parts of this handsome species are bluish gray with a greenish\r\npatch in the middle of the back; the throat and breast are yellow with a\r\npatch of black and chestnut. They are abundant birds in suitable\r\nlocalities, breeding in swamps, especially those with old or dead trees\r\ncovered with hanging moss (usnea). The nests may be found at any height\r\nfrom the ground, and are usually made by turning and gathering up the\r\nends of the hanging moss to form a pocket, which is lined with fine\r\ngrass or hair. The four to six eggs are white or creamy white, wreathed\r\nwith specks of reddish brown and chestnut. Size .64 × .44.\r\n\r\n\r\n648a. NORTHERN PARULA WARBLER. _Compsothlypis americana usneæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern half of eastern United States and southern Canada;\r\nwinters from the Gulf States southward.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of the northern form of the Blue-yellow-backed\r\nWarbler are in all respects like those of the last, and like them, where\r\nmoss grown swamps are not to be found, they have been known to construct\r\nnests of moss suspended from branches of trees, or to nest in bunches of\r\ndead leaves. Data.--Oxford, Mass., June 7, 1895. Nest in a dead pine\r\nswamp; made in end of hanging moss about 6 feet from the ground. Large\r\ncolony breeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 392: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Tennessee Warblers.

SENNETT'S WARBLER. _Compsothlypis piti ayumi nigrilora._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern Mexico, north to the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the Parula but is more extensively yellow\r\nbelow, and has black lores and ear coverts. Their habits are the same as\r\nthose of the last and their nests are generally placed in hanging moss,\r\nand are also said to have been found hollowed out in the mistletoe which\r\ngrows on many trees in southern Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. The eggs\r\ncannot be distinguished from those of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n650. CAPE MAY WARBLER. _Dendroica tigrina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from northern New England and\r\nManitoba northward; winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful Warbler is yellow below and on the rump, streaked on the\r\nbreast and sides with black; the ear coverts and sometimes the throat\r\nare chestnut. They are very local in their distribution both during\r\nmigrations and in their breeding grounds. They nest in the outer\r\nbranches of trees, preferably conifers, making the nest of slender\r\ntwigs, rootlets, grasses, etc., lined with hair; the four or five eggs\r\nare white, variously specked with reddish brown and lilac; size .65 ×\r\n.48.\r\n\r\n\r\n651. OLIVE WARBLER. _Peucedramus olivaceus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of New Mexico and Arizona southward.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar species may readily be recognized by its saffron or\r\norange-brown colored head and neck, with broad black bar through the\r\neye. They nest at high elevations in coniferous trees on the mountain\r\nsides, placing their nests either on the horizontal boughs or forks at\r\nthe end of them. The nests are very beautiful structures made of moss,\r\nlichens, fine rootlets and grasses and setting high on the limb like\r\nthose of the Blue-gray Gnatcatcher. The eggs are grayish white with a\r\nbluish tinge, thickly speckled with blackish; size .64 × .48.\r\nData.--Huachuca Mts., Arizona, June 21, 1901.

CERULEAN WARBLER. _Dendroica cærulea_.\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Plains, breeding chiefly in the\r\nnorthern half of the Mississippi Valley, rare east of the Alleghanies\r\nand casual in New England. These beautiful Warblers are light blue gray\r\nabove, streaked with black on back, white below, with a grayish blue\r\nband on breast and streaks on the sides; they have two wide white wing\r\nbars and spots on the outer tail feathers. They are found chiefly in the\r\nhigher trees where they glean on the foliage; they build also usually\r\nabove twenty feet from the ground in any kind of tree, placing the nests\r\nwell out on the horizontal limbs, generally in a fork. The nests are\r\nmade of fine strips of bark, fibres, rootlets, etc., lined with hair;\r\nthe eggs are white or pale bluish white, specked with reddish brown;\r\nsize .62 × .48. Data.--Fargo, Ontario, June 2, 1901. Nest in a burr oak,\r\n18 feet from the ground on a horizontal limb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 398: Magnolia Warblers.

CHESTNUT-SIDED WARBLER. _Dendroica pensylvanica._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Plains, breeding in the Middle States\r\nand Illinois, north to Manitoba and New Brunswick. Winters south of our\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nThe adults of this handsome species may readily be known by the white\r\nunderparts and the broad chestnut stripe on the flanks; the crown is\r\nyellow. They frequent low brush in open woods or on hillsides and\r\npastures, nesting at low elevations, usually below three feet from the\r\nground, and often concealing their nests beneath the leaves in the tops\r\nof low small bushes. The nests are made of grasses, weed stems and some\r\nfibres, but they do not have as wooly an appearance as those of the\r\nYellow Warblers which nest in the same localities and similar locations.\r\nTheir eggs are white or creamy white (never greenish white), specked\r\nwith brown and gray. Size .65 × .50. Data.--Worcester, Mass., June 6,\r\n1890. Nest in the top of a huckleberry bush, 2 feet from the ground;\r\nmade of grasses and plant fibres. Bird did not leave nest until touched\r\nwith the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n660. BAY-BREASTED WARBLER. _Dendroica castanea._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains, breeding from northern United\r\nStates north to the Hudson Bay; winters in Central and South America.\r\n\r\nThis species has the crown, throat and sides a rich chestnut; forehead\r\nand face black; underparts white. They nest in coniferous trees in\r\nswampy places, making their nests of bark shreds and rootlets and\r\nplacing them in horizontal forks at elevations of from five to thirty\r\nfeet from the ground. The three or four eggs are laid late in May or\r\nduring June; they are white, usually quite heavily spotted and blotched\r\nwith reddish brown, umber and grayish. Size .70 × .50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 400: Chestnut-sided Warblers.

BLACK-POLL WARBLER. _Dendroica striata._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Rockies, breeding from northern\r\nUnited States north to Labrador and Alaska; winters in South America.\r\n\r\nThis black and white Warbler has a solid black cap, and the underparts\r\nare white, streaked with black on the sides. In the woods they bear some\r\nresemblance to the Black and White Warbler, but do not have the creeping\r\nhabits of that species. During migrations they are found in equal\r\nabundance in swamps or orchards. In their breeding range, they nest at\r\nlow elevations in stunted pines or spruces, making their nests of\r\nrootlets and lichens, lined with feathers. The eggs are dull whitish,\r\nspotted or blotched with brown and neutral tints. Size .72 × .50.\r\nData.--Grand Manan, N. B., June 12, 1883. Nest and four eggs on branch\r\nof a stunted spruce 2 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n662. BLACKBURNIAN WARBLER. _Dendroica fusca._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, east of the Plains, breeding from Massachusetts\r\nand Minnesota north to Hudson Bay; south in the Alleghanies to the\r\nCarolinas. Winters in Central and South America.\r\n\r\nThis species is, without exception, the most exquisite of the family;\r\nthe male can always be known by the bright orange throat, breast and\r\nsuperciliary stripe, the upper parts being largely black. They arrive\r\nwith us when the apple trees are in bloom and after a week's delay pass\r\non to more northerly districts. Their nests are constructed of rootlets,\r\nfine weed stalks and grasses, lined with hair, and are placed on\r\nhorizontal limbs of coniferous trees. The three or four eggs are\r\ngreenish white, speckled, spotted and blotched with reddish brown and\r\nneutral tints. Size .70 × .48. Data.--Lancaster, Mass., June 21, 1901.\r\nNest in a white pine, 38 feet from the ground on a limb 4 feet from the\r\ntrunk; composed of fine rootlets and hair, resembling the nest of a\r\nChipping Sparrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 401: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Black-poll Warblers. Blackburnian Warblers.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 400\r\n\r\n[Illustration 402: BLACKBURNIAN WARBLERS.]\r\n\r\nPage 401\r\n\r\n663. YELLOW-THROATED WARBLER. _Dendroica dominica dominica._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States, north to Virginia and casually\r\nfarther; winters in Florida and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThis species has gray upper parts with two white wing bars, the throat,\r\nbreast and superciliary line are yellow, and the lores, cheeks and\r\nstreaks on the sides are black. These birds nest abundantly in the South\r\nAtlantic States, usually in pines, and either on horizontal limbs or in\r\nbunches of Spanish moss. The nests are made of slender pieces of twigs,\r\nrootlets and strips of bark, and lined with either hair or feathers, the\r\neggs are three to five in number, pale greenish white, specked about the\r\nlarge end with reddish brown and gray. Size .70 × .50. Data.--Raleigh,\r\nN. C., May 3, 1890. Nest 43 feet up on limb of pine; made of grasses and\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\r\n663a. SYCAMORE WARBLER. _Dendroica dominica albilora._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mississippi Valley, breeding north to Ohio and Illinois, and\r\nwest to Kansas and Texas; winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis bird is precisely like the last except that the superciliary stripe\r\nis usually white. Their nesting habits are precisely like those of the\r\nlast, and the nests are usually on horizontal branches of sycamores; the\r\neggs cannot be distinguished from those of the Yellow-throated Warbler.\r\n\r\n\r\n664. GRACE'S WARBLER. _Dendroica graciæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States, abundant in Arizona and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis Warbler is similar in markings and colors to the Yellow-throated\r\nvariety except that the cheeks are gray instead of black. The nesting\r\nhabits of the two species are the same, these birds building high in\r\nconiferous trees; the nests are made of rootlets and bark shreds, lined\r\nwith hair or feathers; the eggs are white, dotted with reddish brown and\r\nlilac. Size .68 × .48.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 403: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Yellow-throated Warblers. Grace's Warblers.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 402\r\n\r\n665. BLACK-THROATED GRAY WARBLER. _Dendroica nigrescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States from the Rockies to the Pacific coast and north to\r\nBritish Columbia; winters south of our borders.\r\n\r\nThe general color of this species is grayish above and white below as is\r\na superciliary line and stripe down the side of the throat; the crown,\r\ncheeks and throat are black and there is a yellow spot in front of the\r\neye. They inhabit woodland and thickets and are common in such\r\nlocalities from Arizona to Oregon, nesting usually at low elevations in\r\nbushes or shrubs; the nests are made of grasses and fibres, woven\r\ntogether, and lined with hair or fine grasses, resembling, slightly,\r\nnests of the Yellow Warbler. The eggs are white or greenish white,\r\nspecked with reddish brown and umber. Size .65 × .52. Data.--Waldo,\r\nOregon, June 1, 1901. Nest 3 feet from the ground in a small oak in\r\nvalley. Collector, C. W. Bowles. (Crandall collection.)\r\n\r\n\r\n666. GOLDEN-CHEEKED WARBLER. _Dendroica chrysoparia._\r\n\r\nRange.--Central and southern Texas south to Central America.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and rare species is entirely black above and on the\r\nthroat, enclosing a large bright yellow patch about the eye and a small\r\none on the crown. In their very restricted United States range, the\r\nbirds are met with in cedar timber where they nest at low elevations in\r\nthe upright forks of young trees of this variety. Their nests are made\r\nof strips of cedar bark, interwoven with plant fibres and spider webs\r\nmaking compact nests, which they line with hair and feathers. Their\r\nthree or four eggs are white, dotted and specked with reddish brown and\r\number. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 404: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Black-throated Warblers. Golden-cheeked Warblers.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 403\r\n\r\n667. BLACK-THROATED GREEN WARBLER. _Dendroica virens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from southern New England, South\r\nCarolina in the Alleghanies, and Illinois north to Hudson Bay; winters\r\nsouth of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese common eastern birds are similar to the last but the entire upper\r\nparts are olive greenish. They are nearly always found, and always nest,\r\nin pines, either groves or hillsides covered with young pines. The nests\r\nare usually placed out among the pine needles where they are very\r\ndifficult to locate, and resemble nests of the Chipping Sparrow. I have\r\nfound them at heights ranging from six to forty or fifty feet from the\r\nground. The three or four eggs, which they lay in June, are white,\r\nwreathed and speckled with brownish and lilac. Size .60 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n668. TOWNSEND'S WARBLER. _Dendroica townsendi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, from the Rockies to the Pacific and from\r\nAlaska southward; winters in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis is the common western representative of the last species, and is\r\nsimilar but has black ear patches and the crown is black. They nest in\r\nconiferous woods throughout their United States and Canadian range, the\r\nnests being placed at any height from the ground and being constructed\r\nlike those of the Black-throated Green. Their eggs are not\r\ndistinguishable from those of the latter. Size .60 × .50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 405: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Black-throated Green Warbler. Townsend's Warblers.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 404\r\n\r\n669. HERMIT WARBLER. _Dendroica occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States and British Columbia chiefly on the higher\r\nranges. Winters south to Central America.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar species has the entire head bright yellow and the throat\r\nblack; upperparts grayish, underparts white. They are found nesting in\r\nwild rugged country, high up in pine trees, the nests being located\r\namong bunches of needles so that they are very difficult to find. The\r\nnests are made of rootlets, shreds of bark, pine needles, etc., lined\r\nwith fine grasses or hair. The three or four eggs are laid during June\r\nor the latter part of May; they are white or creamy white, and sometimes\r\nwith a faint greenish tinge, specked and wreathed with brown and lilac\r\ngray. Size .68 × .52.\r\n\r\n\r\n670. KIRTLAND'S WARBLER. _Dendroica kirtlandi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States; apt to be found in any of the South\r\nAtlantic, Middle or Central States, and in Ontario, Canada. Winters in\r\nthe Bahamas where by far the greater number of specimens have been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThis very rare Warbler is bluish gray above, streaked with black, and\r\nyellow below with the throat and sides streaked. Until the summer of\r\n1903, the locality where they bred was a mystery. The capture of a\r\nspecimen, in June, in Oscodo Co., Michigan, led to the search for the\r\nnests by N. A. Wood, taxidermist for the Michigan Museum at Ann Arbor.\r\nHe was successful in his quest and found two nests with young and one\r\negg. The nest in which the egg was found contained two young birds also.\r\nIt was in a depression in the ground at the foot of a Jack pine tree and\r\nonly a few feet from a cart road. The nest was made of strips of bark\r\nand vegetable fibres, lined with grass and pine needles. The egg is\r\nwhite, sprinkled with brown in a wreath about the large end. Size .72 ×\r\n.56. It is estimated that there were thirteen pairs of the birds in this\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 406: Hermit Warblers. Kirtland's Warblers.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 405\r\n\r\n671. PINE WARBLER. _Dendroica vigorsi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to southern\r\nBritish Provinces; winters in the Gulf States and southward.\r\n\r\nThis common eastern species is greenish above and dull yellowish below,\r\nstreaked with dusky on the sides. They are almost exclusively found in\r\npine woods, either light or heavy growth, where they can always be\r\nlocated by their peculiar, musical lisping trill. They nest high in\r\nthese trees, placing their nests in thick bunches of needles, so that\r\nthey are very difficult to locate. They nest from March in the south to\r\nMay in the northern states, laying three or four dull whitish eggs,\r\nspecked or blotched with shades of brown and lilac; size .68 × .52.\r\nData.--Worcester, Mass., May 28, 1891. Nest 30 feet up in a pine; made\r\nof pine needles and rootlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n672. PALM WARBLER. _Dendroica palmarum palmarum._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of North America, breeding about Hudson Bay and\r\nnorthward and wintering in the lower Mississippi Valley and the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nThis species is brownish yellow above and yellow on the throat and\r\nbreast, the crown and streaks on the sides are chestnut. They are found\r\nduring migrations on or near the ground on the edges of woods or\r\nthickets and along roadsides; have a peculiar habit of \"teetering\" their\r\ntail which will readily identify them. They nest on the ground in, or on\r\nthe edges of swampy places, lining the hollow with grasses and rootlets.\r\nIn May or June they lay three or four eggs which are creamy white,\r\nvariously specked with brown and lilac; size .68 × .52.\r\n\r\n\r\n672a. YELLOW PALM WARBLER. _Dendroica palmarum hypochrysea._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from Nova Scotia, northward.\r\n\r\nThis is the common Yellow Redpoll Warbler of the eastern states, and is\r\nvery abundant during migrations. Their habits are the same, if not\r\nidentical with the interior species. Their nests are also like those of\r\nthe last, placed on the ground and the eggs are indistinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 407: Dull white.]\r\n[Illustration: Creamy white.]\r\n[Illustration: Pine Warblers.

PRAIRIE WARBLER. _Dendroica discolor._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to Massachusetts\r\nand Ontario; winters in southern Florida and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nA species readily recognized by its bright yellow underparts and the\r\nblack stripes on the face and sides; several bright chestnut spots are\r\nin the middle of the greenish back. These birds will be found on dry\r\nscrubby hillsides and valleys, where they nest in low bushes, and the\r\nmale will be found in the tops of the tallest lookout trees delivering\r\nhis quaint and very peculiar lisping song. Their nests are handsomely\r\nmade of vegetable fibres and grasses, closely woven together and lined\r\nwith hair; this structure is placed in the top of low bushes so that it\r\nis well concealed by the upper foliage. Their three to five eggs are\r\nwhitish, specked and spotted with shades of brown and neutral tints;\r\nsize .64 × .48. Data.--Worcester, Mass., June 23, 1891. Nest in the top\r\nof a young walnut, two feet from ground; made of plant fibres and\r\ngrasses. Four eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n674. OVEN-BIRD. _Seiurus aurocapillus._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Rockies, breeding from the middle\r\nportions of the United States, north to Labrador and Alaska. Winters\r\nfrom the Gulf States southward.\r\n\r\nThis species is fully as often known as the Golden-crowned Thrush,\r\nbecause of its brownish orange crown bordered with black. They are\r\nwoodland birds exclusively and nest on the ground, arching the top over\r\nwith rootlets or leaves, the nest proper being made of grasses and leaf\r\nskeletons. As they are concealed so effectually, the nests are usually\r\nfound by flushing the bird. The four to six eggs are white, slightly\r\nglossy and spotted, blotched or wreathed with reddish brown and lilac;\r\nsize .80 × .60. Data.--Old Saybrook, Conn., June 19, 1899. Domed nest\r\nwith a side entrance on the ground in woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 409: Whitish.]\r\n[Illustration: Prairie Warblers.

WATER-THRUSH. _Seiurus novebora censis noveboracensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from northern United States\r\nnorth to Hudson Bay and Newfoundland. Winters from the Gulf to South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThis species is uniform brownish olive above and white below, streaked\r\nheavily with blackish; it has a whitish superciliary line. It is known\r\nin most of the United States only as a migrant, being found in moist\r\nwoods or swampy places. They nest in such localities in their breeding\r\nrange, placing their nests among the cavities of rootlets and stumps,\r\nthe nest being made of moss, leaves and rootlets. Their eggs are white,\r\nprofusely specked and blotched with reddish brown and lavender gray.\r\nSize .80 × .60. Data.--Listowell, Ontario, May 28, 1895. Nest in a\r\nturned-up root over water; made of moss, grass and hair. Collector, Wm.\r\nL. Kells. This set of five is in the collection of Mr. C. W. Crandall.\r\n\r\n\r\n675a. GRINNELL'S WATER-THRUSH. _Seiurus noveboracensis notabilis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America, migrating between the Mississippi Valley\r\nand the Rockies; breeds from northern United States north to Alaska;\r\nwinters in the south.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is said to be very slightly larger, darker on the back,\r\nand paler below. Their nesting habits and eggs are identical with those\r\nof the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n676. LOUISIANA WATER-THRUSH. _Seiurus motacilla._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf, north to southern\r\nNew England, Ontario and Minnesota; winters south of our borders.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the last but is larger, grayer and less\r\ndistinctly streaked on the underparts. They nest in swampy places,\r\nconcealing their home in nooks among roots of trees or under overhanging\r\nbanks, the nest being made of leaves, moss, mud, grasses, etc., making a\r\nbulky structure. The eggs, which are laid in May and number from four to\r\nsix, are white, spotted and blotched with chestnut and neutral tints.\r\nSize .76 × .62.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 411: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Louisiana Water Thrush.

KENTUCKY WARBLER. _Oporornis formosus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to New York and\r\nMichigan; winters south of the United States to South America.\r\n\r\nCrown and ear coverts black, underparts and line over eye yellow; no\r\nwhite in the plumage. These birds are found in about such localities as\r\nare frequented by Oven-birds, but with a preference for woods which are\r\nlow and damp. They are locally common in some of the southern and\r\ncentral states. They are active gleaners of the underbrush, keeping well\r\nwithin the depths of tangled thickets. Like the Maryland Yellow-throat,\r\nwhich has similar habits to those of this bird, they are quite\r\ninquisitive and frequently come close to you to investigate or to scold.\r\nThey nest on the ground in open woods or on shrubby hillsides, making\r\nlarge structures, of leaves and strips of bark, lined with grasses. The\r\neggs are white, sprinkled with dots or spots of reddish brown and gray.\r\nSize .70 × .55. Data.--Greene Co., Pa., May 26, 1894. 4 eggs. Nest a\r\nmass of leaves, lined with rootlets, placed on the ground at the base of\r\na small elm sprout in underbrush on a hillside.\r\n\r\n\r\n678. Connecticut Warbler.--_Oporonis agilis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States; known to breed only in Manitoba and\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\nThese birds have greenish upperparts and sides, yellowish underparts,\r\nand an ashy gray head, neck and breast; they have a complete whitish\r\nring about the eye, this distinguishing them in any plumage from the two\r\nfollowing species. As they do most of their feeding upon the ground and\r\nremain in the depths of the thickets, they are rarely seen unless\r\nattention is drawn to them. They are quite abundant in New England in\r\nfall migrations, being found in swampy thickets. They have been found\r\nbreeding in Ontario by Wm. L. Kells, the nest being on the ground in the\r\nwoods among raspberry vines. It was made of leaves, bark fibres, grass,\r\nrootlets and hair. The eggs are white, specked with brown and neutral\r\ntints. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 412: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Kentucky Warbler. Connecticut Warblers.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: Left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 411\r\n\r\n679. MOURNING WARBLER. _Oporornis philadelphia_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from northern New England,\r\nPennsylvania, (Philadelphia) and Nebraska northward.\r\n\r\nVery similar to the last but with no eye ring and a black patch on the\r\nbreast. The habits and nesting habits of this species are very similar\r\nto those of _agilis_, the nest being on or very close to the ground.\r\nWith the exception of on mountain ranges it breeds chiefly north of our\r\nborders. The eggs are white, specked with reddish brown. Size .72 × .55.\r\nThey cannot be distinguished from those of the last. Data.--Listowell,\r\nOntario, June 5, 1898. Nest in a tuft of swamp grass in low ground; not\r\nvery neatly made of dry leaves, grasses and hair. Collector, Wm. L.\r\nKells. (Crandall collection.)\r\n\r\n\r\n680. MACGILLIVRAY WARBLER. _Oporornis tolmiei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States from the Rockies to the Pacific, breeding\r\nnorth to British Columbia; winters in Mexico and Central America.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the last but with white spots on the upper and lower eyelids,\r\nblack lores, and the black patch on the breast mixed with gray. These\r\nground inhabiting birds are found in tangled thickets and shrubbery\r\nwhere they nest at low elevations, from one to five feet from the\r\nground. Their nests are made of grasses and shreds of bark, lined with\r\nhair and finer grasses, and the eggs are white, specked, spotted and\r\nblotched with shades of brown and neutral tints; size .72 × .52.\r\nData.--Sonoma, Cal., May 17, 1897. A small nest, loosely made of grasses\r\n(wild oats) lined with finer grasses; placed in blackberry vines 14\r\ninches from the ground in a slough in the valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 413: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Mourning Warblers.

MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT. _Geothlypis trichas trichas._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States; this species has recently been still\r\nfurther sub-divided so that this form is supposed to be restricted to\r\nthe south Atlantic coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Maryland Yellow-throat is represented in all parts of the United\r\nStates by one of its forms. They are ground loving birds, frequenting\r\nswamps and thickets where they can be located by their loud,\r\nunmistakable song of \"Witchery, w i t c h e r y, witch.\" They nest on or\r\nvery near the ground, making their nests of grass, lined with hair;\r\nthese are either in hollows in the ground at the foot of clumps of grass\r\nor weeds, or attached to the weed stalks within a few inches of the\r\nground. They lay from three to five eggs in May or June; these are\r\nwhite, specked about the larger end with reddish brown and umber, and\r\nwith shell markings of stone gray. Size .70 × .50. All the sub-species\r\nof this bird have the same general habits of this one and their eggs\r\ncannot be distinguished from examples of the eastern form; the birds,\r\ntoo, owing to the great differences in plumage between individuals from\r\nthe same place, cannot be distinguished with any degree of satisfaction\r\nexcept by the ones who \"discovered\" them.\r\n\r\n\r\n681a. WESTERN YELLOW-THROAT. _Geothlypis trichas occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--This variety, which is said to be brighter yellow below, is\r\nascribed to the arid regions of western United States; not on the\r\nPacific coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n681b. FLORIDA YELLOW-THROAT. _Geothlypis trichas ignota._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf coast to Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n681c. PACIFIC YELLOW-THROAT. _Geothlypis trichas arizela._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from British Columbia southward.\r\n\r\n\r\n681e. SALT MARSH YELLOW-THROAT. _Geothlypis trichas sinuosa._\r\n\r\nRange.--Salt marshes of San Francisco Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 414: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Maryland Yellow-throats. Belding's Yellow-throat.]\r\n[Illustration: Left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 413\r\n\r\n682. BELDING'S YELLOW-THROAT. _Geothlypis beldingi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar species is like the common Yellow-throat but has the black\r\nmask bordered by yellow instead of white, and the black on the forehead\r\nextends diagonally across the head from in front of one eye to the rear\r\nof the other. Their habits are like those of the other Yellow-throats\r\nand the nests are similar to those of the latter, which are frequently\r\nplaced in cane over the water. Nests found by Mr. Walter E. Bryant were\r\nsituated in clumps of \"cat-tails\" between two and three feet above the\r\nwater; the nests were made of dry strips of these leaves, lined with\r\nfibres; the eggs were like those of the common Yellow-throats but\r\nlarger; size .75 × .56.\r\n\r\n682.1. RIO GRANDE YELLOW-THROAT. _Chamæthlypis poliocephala._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico north to the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis Yellow-throat has the crown and ear coverts gray, only the lores\r\nand forehead being black. The nests and eggs of these birds, which are\r\nfairly common about Brownsville, Texas, do not differ from those of the\r\nother Yellow-throats.\r\n\r\n\r\n683. YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT. _Icteria virens virens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf coast north to\r\nsouthern New England and Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThis strange but handsome species is very common in underbrush and\r\nthickets in the south; they are usually shy and endeavor, with success,\r\nto keep out of sight, but their strange song and calls, consisting of\r\nvarious whistles and squawks mingled together, are often heard. Their\r\nnests are built in bushes or briars at low elevations, being made of\r\ngrass, strips of bark and leaves, lined with finer grass; their eggs are\r\nwhite, sharply speckled and spotted with various shades of brown and\r\nlavender; size .90 × .70.\r\n\r\n\r\n683a. LONG-TAILED CHAT. _Icteria virens longicauda._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Plains, breeding from Mexico to\r\nBritish Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis bird is said to be grayer and to have a slightly longer tail than\r\nthe last. Its nesting habits and eggs are precisely the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 415: Rio Grande Yellow-throat. Yellow-breasted Chat.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 414\r\n\r\n684. HOODED WARBLER. _Wilsonia citrina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding north to southern New England\r\nand Michigan; winters south of our borders.\r\n\r\nThis yellow and greenish species can be identified by its black head,\r\nneck and throat, with the large yellow patch about the eye and the\r\nforehead. The members of this genus are active fly-catchers, darting\r\ninto the air after passing insects in the manner of the Flycatchers.\r\nThey frequent tangled thickets where they build their nests within a few\r\ninches of the ground, making them of leaves, bark and grass, lined with\r\nhair; the four or five eggs are white, specked with reddish brown and\r\nneutral tints; size .70 × .50. Data.--Doddridge Co., Mo., May 29, 1897.\r\nNest one foot from the ground in a small bush; made of leaves, strips of\r\nbark and fine grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n685. WILSON'S WARBLER. _Wilsonia pusilla pusilla_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from northern United States\r\nnorthward; south to Central America in winter.\r\n\r\nThese handsome little black-capped flycatching Warblers are abundant\r\nduring migrations, especially in the spring, being found on the edges of\r\nwoods and in orchards. They nest on the ground, usually on the edges of\r\nswamps, embedding their nests in the ground under the shelter of low\r\nbranches or on the edges of banks; the nest is of bark strips, fibres\r\nand leaves, and the eggs are white, specked with reddish brown; size .60\r\n× .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n685a. PILEOLATED WARBLER. _Wilsonia pusilla pileolata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding in the Rocky Mountain region\r\nfrom Mexico to Alaska; winters south of the United States.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the eastern form but the yellow underparts and greenish back\r\nare brighter. Like the last species, this form nests on the ground or\r\nvery close to it, in weeds or rank undergrowth, in swamps. Their eggs\r\nwhich are laid in May or June are not distinguishable from those of the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 416: Hooded Warblers. Wilson's Warblers.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 415\r\n\r\n685b. GOLDEN PILEOLATED WARBLER. _Wilsonia pusilla chryseola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of North America, breeding from southern\r\nCalifornia in mountain ranges north to British Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n686. CANADIAN WARBLER. _Wilsonia canadensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from Mass., New York, and\r\nMichigan north to Labrador and Hudson Bay; winters in Central America.\r\n\r\nThis handsome Warbler is plain gray above and yellow below, with a black\r\nstripe down the sides of the neck and across the breast in a broken\r\nband. They frequent swamps or open woods with a heavy growth of\r\nunderbrush, where\r\n\r\nthey build their nests on or very close to the ground. I have always\r\nfound them in Massachusetts nesting about the roots of laurels, the\r\nnests being made of strips of bark, leaves and grass; in June or the\r\nlatter part of May they lay from three to five white eggs, specked and\r\nwreathed with reddish brown and neutral tints; size .68 × .50.\r\nData.--Worcester, Mass., June 10, 1891. Nest on the ground under laurel\r\nroots in swampy woods; made entirely of strips of laurel bark lined with\r\nfine grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n687. American Redstart. _Setophaga ruticilla._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, chiefly east of the Rockies, breeding in the\r\nnorthern half of the United States and north to Labrador and Alaska;\r\nwinters south of our borders.\r\n\r\nThe male of this handsome, active and well known species is black with a\r\nwhite belly, and orange patches on the sides, wings and bases of outer\r\ntail feathers. They breed abundantly in swamps, open woods or thickets\r\nby the roadside, placing their nests in trees or bushes at elevations of\r\nfrom three to thirty feet above ground and usually in an upright fork.\r\nThe nests are very compactly made of fibres and grasses, felted\r\ntogether, and lined with hair. Their eggs are white, variously blotched\r\nand spotted with brown and gray; size .65 × .50. Data.--Chili, N. Y.,\r\nJune 1, 1894. Nest, a cup-shaped structure of plant fibres lined with\r\nfine grasses and hair; 4 feet from the ground in the crotch of a small\r\nchestnut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 417: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Canadian Warblers. American Redstart.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 416\r\n\r\n[Illustration 418: C. A. REED.\r\nMALE REDSTART FEEDING YOUNG.]\r\n\r\nPgee 417\r\n\r\n688. PAINTED REDSTART. _Setophaga picta._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern New Mexico and Arizona, southward.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful Redstart is black with a large white patch on the wing\r\ncoverts, white outer tail feathers, and with the belly and middle of the\r\nbreast bright red. These active birds, which have all the habits and\r\nmannerisms of the common species, nest on the ground in thickets or\r\nshrubbery usually near water, and generally conceal their homes under\r\noverhanging stones or stumps; the nests are made of fine shreds of bark\r\nand grasses, lined with hair; the eggs are white, dotted with reddish\r\nbrown; size .65 x .48. Data.--Chiricahua Mts., Arizona, May 31, 1900.\r\nNest of fine bark and grass under a small bush on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n689. RED-BELLIED REDSTART. _Setophaga miniata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico; admitted to our avifauna on the authority of Giraud as\r\nhaving occurred in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the last, but has a chestnut crown patch,\r\nmore red on the underparts, and less white on the tail; it is not\r\nprobable that their nesting habits or eggs differ from the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n690. RED-FACED WARBLER. _Cardellina rubrifrons._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Arizona and New Mexico, southward.\r\n\r\nThis attractive little Warbler is quite common in mountain ranges of the\r\nsouthern Arizona. They nest on the ground on the side hills, concealing\r\nthe slight structure of grasses and rootlets under overhanging shrubs or\r\nstones. Their eggs are specked and blotched with light reddish brown and\r\nlavender. Size .64 x .48. Data.--Chiricahua Mts., Arizona, May 31, 1902.\r\nNest in a depression under a tuft of grass growing about 8 feet up on\r\nthe side of a bank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 419: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Painted Redstart.

WHITE WAGTAIL. _Motacilla alba._\r\n\r\nRange.--An Old World species; accidental in Greenland.\r\n\r\nThese birds are abundant throughout Europe, nesting on the ground, in\r\nstone walls, or in the crevices of old buildings, etc., the nests being\r\nmade of grass, rootlets, leaves, etc.; the eggs are grayish white,\r\nfinely specked with blackish gray. Size .75 × .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n695. SWINHOE'S WAGTAIL. _Motacilla ocularis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern Asia; accidental in Lower California and probably\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\n\r\n696. ALASKA YELLOW WAGTAIL. _Budytes flavus alascensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern Asia; abundant on the Bering Sea coast of Alaska in the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThese handsome Wagtails are common in summer on the coasts and islands\r\nof Bering Sea, nesting on the ground under tufts of grass or beside\r\nstones, usually in marshy ground. Their eggs number from four to six and\r\nare white, profusely spotted with various shades of brown and gray. Size\r\n.75 × .55. Data.--Kamchatka, June 20, 1896. Nest on the ground; made of\r\nfine rootlets, grass and moss, lined neatly with animal fur.\r\n\r\n\r\n697. PIPIT. _Anthus rubescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding in the Arctic regions, and in the Rocky\r\nMountains south to Colorado, winters in southern United States and\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThe Titlarks are abundant birds in the United States during migrations,\r\nbeing found in flocks in fields and cultivated ground. Their nests,\r\nwhich are placed on the ground in meadows or marshes under tufts of\r\ngrass, are made of moss and grasses; the four to six eggs are dark\r\ngrayish, heavily spotted and blotched with brown and blackish. Size .75\r\n× .55.\r\n\r\n\r\n698. MEADOW PIPIT. _Anthus pratensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Whole of Europe; accidental in Greenland.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the American Pipit and like that species\r\nnests on the ground; they are very abundant and are found in meadows,\r\nwoods or thickets in the vicinity of houses. Their nests are made\r\nchiefly of grasses, lined with hair; the eggs are from four to six in\r\nnumber and are grayish, very heavily spotted and blotched with grayish\r\nbrown. Size .78 × .58.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 420: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: American Pipit.

RED-THROATED PIPIT. _Anthus cervinus._\r\n\r\nRange.--An Old World species; accidental in the Aleutians and Lower\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this bird are like those of the others of the\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\n\r\n700. SPRAGUE'S PIPIT. _Anthus spraguei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of North America, breeding from Wyoming north to\r\nSaskatchewan. Winters in the plains of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese birds are common on the prairies and breed abundantly on the\r\nplains of the interior of northern United States and Manitoba. They have\r\na flight song which is said to be fully equal to that of the famous\r\nEuropean Skylark. They nest on the ground under tufts of grass or\r\nup-turned sods, lining the hollow with fine grasses; their three or four\r\neggs are grayish white, finely specked with grayish black or purplish.\r\nSize .85 × .60. Data.--Crescent Lake, Canada. Nest of fine dried\r\ngrasses, built in the ground at the side of a sod.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPPERS. Family CINCLIDÆ\r\n\r\n701. DIPPER. _Cinclus mexicanus unicolor._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of western North America from Alaska to Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThese short-tailed, grayish colored birds are among the strangest of\r\nfeathered creatures; they frequent the sides of mountain streams where\r\nthey feed upon aquatic insects and small fish. Although they do not have\r\nwebbed feet, they swim on or under water with the greatest of ease and\r\nrapidity, using their wings as paddles. They have a thrush-like bill and\r\nthe teetering habits of the Sandpiper, and they are said to be one of\r\nthe sweetest of songsters. They nest among the rocks along the banks of\r\nswiftly flowing streams, and sometimes beneath falls; the nests are\r\nlarge round structures of green moss, lined with fine grass and with the\r\nentrance on the side. The eggs are pure white, four or five in number,\r\nand laid during May or June. Size 1.00 × .70.\r\n\r\nWRENS, THRASHERS, ETC. Family TROGLODYTIDÆ\r\n\r\n\r\n702. SAGE THRASHER. _Oreoscoptes montanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Plains and valleys of western United States, east of the Sierra\r\nNevadas, from Montana to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species is abundant in the sage regions of the west, nesting on the\r\nground or at low elevations in sage or other bushes. Their nests are\r\nmade of twigs, rootlets and bark strips, lined with fine rootlets; the\r\nthree or four eggs are a handsome greenish blue, brightly spotted with\r\nreddish brown and gray. Size .95 × .70. Data.--Salt Lake Co., Utah, May\r\n11, 1900. Nest placed in a sage bush; made of twigs of the same and\r\nlined with bark strips. Collector, W. H.

MOCKINGBIRD. _Mimus polyglottos polyglottos_.\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States, north to New Jersey and\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nThese noted birds are very common in the south where they are found, and\r\nnest about houses in open woods, fields, and along roadways; their nests\r\nare rude, bulky structures of twigs, grasses, leaves, etc., placed in\r\ntrees or bushes at low elevations; the three to five eggs are usually\r\ndull greenish blue, boldly spotted with brownish. Size .95 × .72.\r\n\r\n\r\n703a. WESTERN MOCKINGBIRD. _Mimus polyglottos leucopterus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States from Texas to California, and\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThis subspecies is as common in its range, and its habits are the same\r\nas those of the eastern bird. The nests and eggs are identical with\r\nthose of the last, and like that variety they frequently nest in odd\r\nplaces as do all common birds when they become familiar with\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n704. CATBIRD. _Dumetella carolinensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from the Gulf States to the\r\nSaskatchewan; rare on the Pacific coast; winters in the Gulf States and\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThis well known mimic is abundant in the temperate portions of its\r\nrange, frequenting open woods, swamps, hillsides and hedges. Their nests\r\nare usually low down in bushes or trees, and are constructed similarly\r\nto those of the Mockingbird, of twigs and rootlets; a tangled mass of\r\nvines and briers is a favorite place for them to locate their home.\r\nTheir eggs are laid in the latter part of May or during June, and are\r\nfrom three to five in number and a bright bluish green in color,\r\nunmarked. Size .95 × .70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 422: Dull greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Mockingbird.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Catbird.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 421\r\n\r\n705. BROWN THRASHER. _Toxostoma rufum_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from the Gulf States north to\r\nCanada. Winters in the Gulf States and southward.\r\n\r\nThis large, handsome songster is found breeding in just such localities\r\nas are preferred by the Catbird and the two are often found nesting in\r\nthe same hedge or thicket. The nests, too, are similar but that of the\r\nThrasher is usually more bulky; besides building in bushes they\r\nfrequently nest on the ground, lining the hollow under some bush with\r\nfine rootlets. Their three to five eggs are laid during May or June;\r\nthey are whitish or pale greenish white, profusely dotted with reddish\r\nbrown. Size 1.05 × .80.\r\n\r\n\r\n706. SENNETT'S THRASHER. _Toxostoma longirostre sennetti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Texas and northeastern Mexico.\r\n\r\nVery similar to the last but darker above and with the spots on the\r\nbreast blacker and more distinct. This species which is very abundant in\r\nthe Lower Rio Grande Valley nests the same as the last species in thick\r\nhedges and the eggs are very similar to those of the Brown Thrasher, but\r\nin a large series, average more sparingly marked over the whole surface\r\nand with a more definite wreath about the large end. Data.--Corpus\r\nChristi, Texas, May 12, 1899. Nest of twigs and vines in a bush in\r\nthicket. Six feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n707. CURVE-BILLED THRASHER. _Toxostoma curvirostre curvirostre._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico, north to southern Texas and eastern New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species is a uniform ashy gray above and soiled white below; the\r\nbill is stout and decurved. These birds are as numerous in the Lower Rio\r\nGrande Valley as are the Sennett's Thrasher, frequenting thickets where\r\nthey breed in scrubby bushes and cacti. Their nests are rather larger\r\nand more deeply cupped than are those of the last species and the eggs\r\ncan easily be distinguished. They have a ground color of light bluish\r\ngreen, minutely dotted evenly all over the surface with reddish brown.\r\nSize 1.10 × .80. Data.--Brownsville, Texas, April 6, 1900. 5 eggs. Nest\r\nof sticks and thorns on a cactus in a thicket; 6 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 423: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Brown Thrasher.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: 707a--708--710.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 422\r\n\r\n707a. PALMER'S THRASHER. _Toxostoma curvirostre palmeri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Very abundant in southern Arizona and southward into Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of these birds are exactly like those of the\r\nlast; they show a preference for placing their nests of sticks and\r\nthorny twigs upon cacti at elevations below five feet from the ground.\r\nLike the last, they generally raise two broods a season.\r\n\r\n\r\n708. BENDIRE'S THRASHER. _Toxostoma bendirei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Arizona and Mexico; north locally to southern Colorado.\r\n\r\nThis species is not as abundant in the deserts of southern Arizona as\r\nare the last species with which they associate. They nest at low\r\nelevations in mesquites or cacti, laying their first sets in March and\r\nearly April and usually raising two broods a season; their three or four\r\neggs are dull whitish, spotted and blotched with brownish drab and lilac\r\ngray. Size 1.00 × .72. Data.--Tucson, Arizona, April 15, 1896. Nest 3\r\nfeet up in a cholla cactus; made of large sticks lined with fine\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n709.

LECONTE'S THRASHER. _Toxostoma lecontei lecontei._\r\n\r\nRange.--Desert regions of southwestern United States, chiefly in the\r\nvalleys of the Gila and Colorado Rivers.\r\n\r\nThis species is much paler than the last and has a shorter bill. It is\r\nfairly common but locally distributed in its range and nests at low\r\nelevations in bushes or cacti. The three or four eggs are pale greenish\r\nblue, sparingly dotted with reddish brown. Size 1.10 × .75.\r\nData.--Phoenix, Arizona, April 2, 1897. 3 eggs. Large nest of dry twigs,\r\nrootlets, etc., lined with bits of rabbit hair and feathers; 4 feet from\r\nthe ground in a small shrub.\r\n\r\n\r\n711a. DESERT THRASHER. _Toxostoma lecontei arenicola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis form of the last is said to differ in being darker above.

BRYANT'S CACTUS WREN. _Heleodytes brunneicapillus bryanti._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Lower California and coast of southern California.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this variety differ in no respect from those of\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\r\n713b. SAN LUCAS CACTUS WREN. _Heleodytes brunneicapillus affinis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nEggs indistinguishable from those of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n715. ROCK WREN. _Salpinctes obsoletus obsoletus._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, west of the plains, breeding north to British\r\nColumbia, and south to Mexico; winters in southwestern United States and\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThis species appears to be quite abundant on rocky hillsides throughout\r\nits range; like most of the Wrens they draw attention to themselves by\r\ntheir loud and varied song. They nest in crevices or beneath overhanging\r\nrocks, making the nest out of any trash that may be handy, such as\r\nweeds, grass, wool, bark, rootlets, etc.; their eggs range from four to\r\neight in number and are pure white, finely specked with reddish brown.\r\nSize .72 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n716. GUADALUPE ROCK WREN. _Salpinctes guadeloupensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Guadalupe Island, Lower California.\r\n\r\nA similar but darker and browner species than the Rock Wren. It breeds\r\nin abundance throughout the island from which it takes its name, placing\r\nits nests in crevices among the boulders or cavities of fallen tree\r\ntrunks and, as is often done by the last species, lining the pathway to\r\nthe nest with small pebbles. The eggs, which are laid from January to\r\nApril, resemble, in all respects, those of the common Rock Wren.\r\n\r\n\r\n717. WHITE-THROATED WREN. _Catherpes mexicanus albifrons._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northeastern Mexico and the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the White-throated Wren are the same as those of the Canon\r\nWren, which variety is more common and better known; the eggs of this\r\nspecies are not distinguishable from those of the next.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 426: Rock Wren.]\r\n[Illustration: white.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 425\r\n\r\n717a. CANON WREN. _Catherpes mexicanus conspersus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region and west to the Sierra Nevadas; north to\r\nWyoming and Idaho and south to New Mexico and Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe Canon Wrens are uniform rusty brown all over except the large\r\nsharply defined white throat patch; the underparts, wings and tail are\r\nbarred with black, and the back is specked with white. Their name is\r\nwell chosen for they are found abundantly in rocky canyons, ravines, and\r\nside hills. They nest in crevices or caves among the rocks, placing\r\ntheir nests in small niches; they are made of twigs, leaves, grasses and\r\nfeathers, and the three to six eggs, which are laid from April to June\r\naccording to locality, are white, sprinkled and blotched with reddish\r\nbrown and lilac. Size .72 × .52.\r\n\r\n\r\n717b. DOTTED CANON WREN. _Catherpes mexicanus punctulatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Oregon to Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe habits and eggs of this coast form of the White-throated Wren do not\r\nvary in any particular from those of the preceding variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n718. CAROLINA WREN. _Thryothorus ludovicianus ludovicianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to southern New\r\nEngland and Illinois; resident in the greater part of its range.\r\n\r\nThese loud-voiced songsters are well known in the south where they are\r\nvery abundant, being found along banks of streams, in thickets, along\r\nwalls, or about brush heaps. They nest in almost any suitable nook or\r\ncorner, in hollow trees or stumps, bird boxes, about buildings, and in\r\nbrush or bushes. When in exposed positions, the nest, which is made of\r\nall sorts of trash, is arched over; the eggs, which are laid from March\r\nto June, and frequently later, as several broods are sometimes reared in\r\na season, are white, profusely specked with light reddish brown and\r\npurplish. Size .74 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n718a. FLORIDA WREN. _Thryothorus ludovicianus miamensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Florida.\r\n\r\nA similar bird to the last but darker above and brighter below. Its eggs\r\nare not distinguishable from those of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n718b. LOMITA WREN. _Thryothorus ludovicianus lomitensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Texas.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species is abundant along the Lower Rio Grande in southern\r\nTexas, where its habits are the same as those of the others and the eggs\r\nare not distinctive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 427: Carolina Wren.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 717a--719a.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 426\r\n\r\n719. BEWICK'S WREN. _Thryomanes bewicki bewicki._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States, and the Mississippi Valley north\r\nto Minnesota and locally to the Middle States in the east.\r\n\r\nThis species is not common on the Atlantic coast but in the interior it\r\nis the most abundant of the Wrens, nesting in holes in trees, stumps,\r\nfences, bird boxes, tin cans, etc., filling the cavities with grass and\r\nrootlets. Their eggs are laid in the latter part of April or May; they\r\nare white, specked and usually wreathed about the large end with reddish\r\nbrown and purplish. Size .65 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n719a. VIGORS'S WREN. _Thryomanes bewicki spilurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of California.\r\n\r\nThis similar bird to the last has the same general habits and the eggs\r\nare not in any way different from those of Bewick's Wren.\r\n\r\n\r\n719b. BAIRD'S WREN. _Thryomanes bewicki bairdi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southwestern United States, from western Texas to eastern\r\nCalifornia and north to Colorado and Nevada.\r\n\r\nLike the two preceding Wrens, this one nests in natural or artificial\r\ncavities, and the four to seven eggs that they lay are precisely alike,\r\nin every respect, to those of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n719c. TEXAS WREN. _Thryomanes bewicki cryptus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Texas, north in summer to western Kansas.\r\n\r\nA very abundant bird in Texas. Nesting habits not unusual nor eggs\r\ndistinctive.\r\n\r\n\r\n719d. SAN DIEGO WREN. _Thryomanes bewicki charienturus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of southern California.\r\n\r\n719e. SEATTLE WREN. _Thryomanes bewicki calophonus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Oregon to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThese last two sub-species have recently been separated from Vigors's\r\nWren, but their habits and eggs remain the same as those of that\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n\r\n719.1. SAN CLEMENTE WREN. _Thryomanes leucophrys._\r\n\r\nRange.--San Clemente Island, California.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to Vigors's Wren but is grayer and paler above.\r\nIt is not peculiar in its nesting habits and the eggs are like those of\r\n_bewicki_.\r\n\r\n\r\n720. GUADALUPE WREN. _Thryomanes brevicauda._\r\n\r\nRange.--Guadalupe Island.\r\n\r\nA very similar species to the Vigors's Wren; nesting habits and the eggs\r\nare not apt to differ in any respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 428: Bewick's Wren.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 427\r\n\r\n721. HOUSE WREN. _Troglodytes aëdon._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Mississippi, breeding from the Gulf\r\nnorth to Manitoba and Ontario; winters in the southern half of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis familiar and noisy little Wren is the most abundant and widely\r\ndistributed of the Wrens; they are met with on the edges of woods,\r\nswamps, fields, pastures, orchards and very frequently build about\r\nhouses, in bird houses or any nook that may suit them; they fill the\r\ncavity of the place they may select with twigs, grass, feathers, plant\r\ndown, etc., and lay from five to nine eggs in a set and frequently three\r\nsets a year. The eggs are pinkish white, very profusely and minutely\r\ndotted with pale reddish brown so as to make the egg appear to be a\r\nnearly uniform salmon color and with a wreath of darker spots about the\r\nlarge end. Size .65 × .52. Data.--Gretna, N. Y., May 29, 1896. Nest\r\nthree feet from the ground in cavity of an apple tree; made of twigs and\r\ngrass, and lined with hair and feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n721a. WESTERN HOUSE WREN. _Troglodytes aëdon parkmani._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, from the Mississippi Valley to eastern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThis variety is grayer above and below than the eastern form, but its\r\nhabits and eggs do not differ in any respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n722. WINTER WREN. _Nannus hiemalis hiemalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from northern United States\r\nnorthward, and south in the Alleghanies to North Carolina; winters in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThese are the smallest of the Wrens, being but four inches in length;\r\nthey have a very short tail which, like those of the others, is carried\r\nerect over the back during excitement or anger. They are very sly birds\r\nand creep about through stone walls and under brush like so many mice;\r\nthey have a sweet song but not as loud as that of the House Wren. Their\r\nnests are placed in crevices of stumps, walls, old buildings or in brush\r\nheaps, being made of twigs and leaves, lined with feathers. Their eggs,\r\nwhich are laid during May or June, are pure white, finely and sparingly\r\ndotted with reddish brown; size .60 × .48.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 429: House Wren.]\r\n[Illustration: Pinkish white.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 428\r\n\r\n722a. WESTERN WINTER WREN. _Nannus hiemalis pacificus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western North America from the Rockies to the coast, north to\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nThis species is much browner both above and below and is more heavily\r\nbarred than the last; its habits and eggs are like those of _hiemalis_.\r\n\r\n722b. KADIAK WINTER WREN. _Nannushiemalis helleri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Kadiak Island, Alaska.\r\n\r\nSaid to be slightly larger and paler than _pacificus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n723. ALASKA WREN. _Nannus alascensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Aleutian and Pribilof Islands, Alaska.\r\n\r\nLarger and paler than the Western Winter Wren. The habits of this\r\nspecies are similar to those of the eastern Winter Wren; they nest\r\nbetween boulders and in crevices of rocks or stumps, making their nests\r\nof moss and rootlets, lined with feathers. The eggs are like those of\r\nthe Winter Wren but slightly larger; size .65 × .51.\r\n\r\n\r\n723.1. ALEUTIAN WREN. _Nannus meliger._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Aleutian Islands to Alaska. Very similar to the above,\r\nboth in song and general habits. They nest in the crevices of rocks or\r\nbetween boulders, making their nests of rootlets and grass, lining it\r\nwith hair and feathers. Usually six eggs are laid, white with a few\r\nspecks of brown (.58 × .46).\r\n\r\n\r\n724. SHORT-BILLED MARSH WREN. _Cistothorus stellaris_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to Manitoba and\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\nThis species does not appear to be as common anywhere as is the\r\nLong-billed variety, whose habits and nests are similar. They nest in or\r\non the borders of marshes, and nests being globular structures of\r\ngrasses, lined with hair, and with the entrance on the side; they are\r\nattached above the ground or water in marsh grass or reeds. Their eggs,\r\nwhich number from six to eight, are pure white; size .64 × .48.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 430: Winter Wren.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 623--723.1--725a.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 429\r\n\r\n725. LONG-BILLED MARSH WREN. _Telmatodytes palustris palustris._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Rockies, breeding from the Gulf north\r\nto Manitoba and New England; winters in southern United States.\r\n\r\nThese birds are very abundant in suitable localities throughout their\r\nrange, breeding in colonies in large marshes and in smaller numbers in\r\nsmall marshy places. Their nests are similar to those of the last, being\r\nglobular and attached to cat-tails or reeds; the entrance is a small\r\nround hole in the side of the rush-woven structures and the interior is\r\nneatly finished with fine grass and hair. They lay from five to eight\r\neggs of a pale chocolate color, dotted and spotted with darker shades of\r\nthe same; size .64 × .45. Data.--Delray, Mich., May 27, 1900. Six eggs.\r\nNest a ball of woven flags and grasses, lined with cat-tail down, and\r\nattached to rushes in salt marsh over two feet of water. Collector, Geo.\r\nW. Morse.\r\n\r\n\r\n725a. TULE WREN. _Telmatodytes palustris paludicola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States on the Pacific coast; north to British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of these birds are in all respects like\r\nthose of the last.\r\n\r\n725b. WORTHINGTON'S MARSH WREN. _Telmatodytes palustris griseus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast of South Carolina and Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe habits and eggs of this paler form are identical with those of\r\n_palustris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n725c. WESTERN MARSH WREN. _Telmatodytes palustris plesius._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States west of the Rockies, except the Pacific coast;\r\nnorth to British Columbia. This variety is like the Tule Wren but\r\nslightly paler; its nesting habits and eggs are the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n725.1. MARIAN'S MARSH WREN. _Telmatodytes palustris marianæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--West coast of Florida.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the Long-billed variety but is darker and\r\nmore barred above and below. Its nests and eggs will not be found to\r\ndiffer materially from those of the others of this genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 431: Short-billed Marsh Wren. Long-billed Marsh Wren.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale brown.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 430\r\n\r\nCREEPERS. Family CERTHIIDÆ\r\n\r\n726. BROWN CREEPER. _Certhia familiaris americana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from the northern tier of states\r\nnorthward; winters in the United States.\r\n\r\nThese peculiar, weak-voiced Creepers are common in northern United\r\nStates during the winter, when they may be seen slowly toiling up the\r\ntree trunks, searching the crannies of the bark for larvae. They make\r\ntheir nests behind loose hanging bark on old tree stubs, usually at low\r\nelevations, building them of twigs, bark, moss, etc., held together with\r\ncobwebs. The eggs, which are laid in May or June, are pure white,\r\nspecked and spotted with reddish brown; they average in size .58 × .48.\r\nThe nests are most often found under the loosened bark on coniferous\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n726a. MEXICAN CREEPER. _Certhia familiaris albescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western Mexico north to southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this brighter colored form are the same as those\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n726b. ROCKY MOUNTAIN CREEPER. _Certhia familiaris montana._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountains, breeding from New Mexico to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this grayer variety cannot be distinguished from those of\r\nthe eastern birds and the nests are in similar situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n726c. CALIFORNIA CREEPER. _Certhia familiaris occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from southern California north to Alaska.\r\n\r\nAn abundant species, especially on mountain ranges, breeding behind the\r\nbark chiefly on pine trees. The eggs are not different from those of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n726d. SIERRA CREEPER. _Certhia familiaris zelotes._\r\n\r\nRange.--Sierra Nevada Mountains in California and the Cascade Range in\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nVery similar to the last and with the same habits; eggs\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 432: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Brown Creeper.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 431\r\n\r\nNUTHATCHES AND TITS. Family SITTIDÆ\r\n\r\n727. WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH. _Sitta carolinensis carolinensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States east of the Rockies, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nsouthern Canada; resident throughout its range.\r\n\r\nThese birds are creepers, but unlike the last species, these run about\r\non the trunks, either up or down; their tails are not pointed and\r\nstiffened like those of the Brown Creepers, and their plumage is gray\r\nand black above with a black crown, and white below. They nest in holes\r\nin trees, usually deep in the woods and at any elevation from the\r\nground; they nearly always use deserted Woodpeckers' holes but are said\r\nat times to excavate their own, with great labor as their bills are\r\nlittle adapted for that work. They line the cavities with bark strips\r\nand hair or feathers, and during April or May, lay from four to nine\r\nwhite eggs, profusely specked with reddish brown and lilac. Size .80 ×\r\n.60. Data.--Lancaster, Mass., May 16, 1902. Nest in hole in an oak tree,\r\n45 feet above ground; made of fine strips of bark fibre and hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n727a. SLENDER-BILLED NUTHATCH. _Sitta carolinensis aculeata._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, west of the Rockies and from Mexico to British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThis species is as abundant in the west as the last is in the east, and\r\nnests in like situations. The eggs cannot be distinguished from those of\r\nthe eastern birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n727b. FLORIDA WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH. _Sitta carolinensis atkinsi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Florida and the South Atlantic coast to South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe habits and eggs of these birds are like those of the northern ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n727c. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NUTHATCH. _Sitta carolinensis nelsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountains from Mexico north to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nTheir nesting habits or eggs are not distinctive in any respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n727d. SAN LUCAS NUTHATCH. _Sitta carolinensis lagunæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountain ranges of Lower California.\r\n\r\nSaid to be like _aculeata_ but with the wings and tail slightly shorter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 433: White-breasted Nuthatch.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 432\r\n\r\n728. RED-BREASTED NUTHATCH. _Sitta canadensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from the northern tier of states\r\nnorthward, and farther south in mountain ranges; winters south to\r\nsouthern United States.\r\n\r\nThis species is smaller than the last and has reddish brown underparts\r\nand a black stripe through the eye. The breeding habits are the same as\r\nthose of the White-bellied variety, but these birds almost invariably\r\ncoat the tree below the opening with pitch, for what purpose is unknown.\r\nThey lay from four to six white eggs, numerously spotted with reddish\r\nbrown; size, .60 × .50. Data.--Upton, Maine, June 21, 1898. Nest in hole\r\nof dead birch stub, 20 feet from the ground; made of strips of bark and\r\na few feathers. 5 eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n729. BROWN-HEADED NUTHATCH. _Sitta pusilla._\r\n\r\nRange.--South Atlantic and Gulf States.\r\n\r\nThis species has a yellowish brown crown and whitish underparts. Their\r\nhabits are like those of the other Nuthatches, they nesting in cavities\r\nat varying heights, from two to fifty feet from the ground. That they\r\nsometimes depart from the usual custom is evidenced by the data\r\naccompanying this egg. They lay from four to seven eggs, white with\r\nprofuse markings of reddish brown; size .60 × .48. Data.--St. Mary's,\r\nGa. Nest situated under the bark of an old dead pine stump, 4 feet from\r\nthe ground; made of fine strips of bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n730. PYGMY NUTHATCH. _Sitta pygmæa pygmæa._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America west of the Rockies, breeding from Mexico north to\r\nBritish Columbia. Resident throughout its range.\r\n\r\nThis species has an olive gray crown bordered by dusky, the back is ashy\r\nblue and the underparts soiled white or rusty. They are common in\r\nmountains of western United States, nesting in holes in trees the same\r\nas the other species of Nuthatches. They lay from five to nine eggs\r\nwhich are white, speckled thickly with reddish brown; size .60 × .50.\r\nData.--Huachuca Mts., Arizona, May 25, 1901. Nest in cavity (10 inches\r\ndeep) in dead pine stump about 15 feet from the ground; composed of a\r\nmass of vegetable down; altitude 9000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 434: Red-breasted Nuthatch.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Brown-headed Nuthatch.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 433\r\n\r\n730a. WHITE-NAPED NUTHATCH. _Sitta pygmæa leuconucha._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nLike the last but grayer above and white below. Its habits and eggs are\r\nthe same as those of the Pygmy Nuthatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n731. TUFTED TITMOUSE. _Bæolophus bicolor_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, resident and breeding from the Gulf north\r\nto New York and Illinois.\r\n\r\nThis species has a grayish crest and upper parts, and is white beneath\r\nwith brownish sides and black forehead. These common and noisy birds\r\nnest in natural cavities in trees or in holes deserted by Woodpeckers;\r\nthey may be found at any elevation, from two to thirty feet from the\r\nground. They line the bottom of the cavity with leaves, bark, fibres and\r\nhair, and during April or May lay five to eight white eggs, plentifully\r\nspecked with reddish brown. Size .74 × .54.\r\n\r\n\r\n732. BLACK-CRESTED TITMOUSE. _Bæolophus atricristatus atricristatus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas and southward.\r\n\r\nThis Titmouse has a black crest and the forehead is white; otherwise\r\nsimilar to the preceding. Like the last, these birds nest in deserted\r\nWoodpeckers' holes and natural cavities in trees, either in open woods\r\nor in the vicinity of habitations. Their eggs are sparsely spotted with\r\nreddish brown, and not usually distinguishable from those of the Tufted\r\nTitmouse. Size .70 × .54. Data.--Brownsville, Texas, May 11, 1892. Nest\r\nof moss, hair, down and wool in cavity in tree in open woods near town;\r\n4 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 435: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Tufted Titmouse. Black-crested Titmouse.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 434\r\n\r\n733. PLAIN TITMOUSE. _Bæolophus inornatus inornatus_.\r\n\r\nRange.--California and Oregon west of the Sierra Nevadas.\r\n\r\nThis common, slightly crested Titmouse is grayish brown above and\r\ngrayish white below. They nest anywhere in cavities that meet with their\r\napproval, about old buildings, in fence posts, etc., as well as holes in\r\ntrees. Their eggs range from five to eight in number and are white,\r\nusually spotted with pale brownish. Size .72 × .52. Data.--Tulare Co.,\r\nCalifornia, April 3, 1895. Nest in an oak tree, 32 feet from the ground,\r\nin a natural cavity of a horizontal limb; composed of grasses, feathers\r\nand fur.\r\n\r\n\r\n733a. GRAY TITMOUSE. _Bæolophus inornatus griseus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southeastern United States, from Colorado and Nevada southward.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this gray Titmouse are just the same as those of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n733b. ASHY TITMOUSE. _Bæolophus inornatus cineraceus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe habits of this variety are the same as those of the Plain Titmouse\r\nand doubtless the eggs are also.\r\n\r\n\r\n734. BRIDLED TITMOUSE. _Bæolophus wollweberi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexico north to southern Arizona, New Mexico and western Texas.\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is quite abundant in the mountains of southern\r\nArizona, and nests in woods or about ranches, lining the cavities of\r\ntrees with moss, down, leaves, etc. The three to seven eggs that they\r\nlay are pure white, unmarked. Size .65 × .52. Data.--Huachuca Mountains,\r\nArizona, April 5, 1901. Nest in the natural cavity of a live oak, 12\r\nfeet from the ground; cavity lined with bark and feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n735. CHICKADEE. _Penthestes atricapillus atricapillus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding from the Middle and Central\r\nStates northward to Labrador; only migratory to a slight extent.\r\n\r\nThe Chickadee is too well known to need any description; suffice it to\r\nsay that they are the favorites, with everybody, among all the North\r\nAmerican birds. They breed in holes in trees in orchards or woods, and\r\nalso in bird boxes. I have found by far the greater number in decayed\r\nbirch stubs. They line the cavities with fine grasses and feathers, and\r\nduring May or June lay from five to eight white eggs, dotted with\r\nreddish brown; size .55 × .45.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 436: White.]\r\n[Illustration: 733--734.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Chickadee. Carolina Chickadee.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 435\r\n\r\n735a. LONG-TAILED CHICKADEE. _Penthestes ataricapillus septentrionalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region, north to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis variety is very similar to the last but has a slightly longer tail\r\nand the colors are purer. Its nesting habits are the same and the eggs\r\nare indistinguishable from those of the eastern Chickadee.\r\n\r\n\r\n735b. OREGON CHICKADEE. _Penthestes atricapillus occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from California to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe habits and eggs of this slightly darker variety are just the same as\r\nthose of the common Chickadee of the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n736. CAROLINA CHICKADEE. _Penthestes carolinensis carolinensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern United States from the Gulf to New Jersey and Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe southern Chickadee is smaller than the northern and the wing coverts\r\nand feathers have little or no white edgings. Their nesting habits are\r\nin every particular the same as those of _atricapillus_ and the eggs\r\ncannot be distinguished with certainty, but average smaller; size .53 ×\r\n.43.\r\n\r\n\r\n736a. PLUMBEOUS CHICKADEE. _Penthestes carolinensis agilis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern and central Texas.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said to be more plumbeous above and much whiter below\r\nthan the preceding. No differences can be found in the eggs of the two\r\nvarieties and the nesting habits are the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n737. MEXICAN CHICKADEE. _Penthestes sclateri._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mountains of western Mexico north to southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis species has the black more extended on the throat and the under\r\nparts are grayish of a lighter shade than the upper, the cheeks,\r\nhowever, remaining white. Their nests are in hollow stubs and the eggs\r\nare indistinguishable from those of the foregoing Chickadees.\r\n\r\n\r\n738. MOUNTAIN CHICKADEE. _Penthestes gambeli gambeli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region and west to the Pacific; north to British\r\nColumbia chiefly in higher ranges.\r\n\r\nThis handsome little Titmouse has a white superciliary line, leaving a\r\nblack stripe through the eye. Their habits are like those of the other\r\nChickadees and they are equally confiding and inquisitive. Their eggs\r\nrange from five to eight in number and are either pure white or faintly\r\nmarked with reddish brown; size .60 × .45. Data.--Estes Park, Colorado,\r\nJune 8, 1803. Nest in an old Sapsucker's hole in a live aspen tree, 28\r\nfeet from the ground; cavity lined with hair and fur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 437: 735b--737--738.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 436\r\n\r\n739. ALASKA CHICKADEE. _Penthestes cinctus alascensis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Alaska and eastern Siberia.\r\n\r\nThis bird, which is most like the Hudsonian Chickadee, nests in the\r\nusual manner and its eggs are like those of the common Chickadee of the\r\neast.\r\n\r\n\r\n740. HUDSONIAN CHICKADEE. _Penthestes hudsonicus hudsonicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western half of British America.\r\n\r\nThese brown capped Chickadees are very abundant throughout the northwest\r\nand are even tamer than our United States varieties. They usually make\r\ntheir nests at low elevations in dead and decayed stumps and line the\r\nbottom of the cavity, which varies from three to eight inches in depth,\r\nwith moss and fur. Their eggs, which they lay in May, June or July, are\r\nwhite, specked with reddish brown and cannot with any certainty be\r\ndistinguished from those of the Black-capped Chickadees, the eggs of all\r\nthe species showing considerable variations; size .60 × .45.\r\n\r\n\r\n740a. ACADIAN CHICKADEE. _Penthestes hudsonicus littoralis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Kowak River, northwest Alaska.\r\n\r\nA larger and grayer form of the last species; nesting habits and eggs\r\nnot differing.\r\n\r\n\r\n740b. COLUMBIAN CHICKADEE. _Penthestes hudsonicus columbianus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountains from northern United States to Alaska.\r\n\r\nLike _hudsonicus_ but with the crown slaty instead of brownish. No\r\ndifference can be distinguished either in their habits or eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n740c. CANADIAN CHICKADEE. _Penthestes hudsonicus littoralis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern half of Canada and northern New England and New York.\r\n\r\nThese birds were formerly _hudsonicus_ in company with the western ones,\r\nbut they are now supposed to be a trifle smaller and with the crown\r\nduller; this division does not affect the similarity of their habits and\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 438: Hudsonian Chickadee.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 437\r\n\r\n741. CHESTNUT-BACKED CHICKADEE. _Penthestes rufescens rufescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Oregon to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the Hudsonian in having a brown crown and\r\nblack throat, but has in addition, a chestnut colored back and sides.\r\nThey breed locally in Oregon, more commonly in Washington and are\r\nabundant in British Columbia, making the nests of animal fur in holes in\r\ndead stubs. Their eggs vary in number from five to eight and are creamy\r\nwhite, dotted with reddish; size .60 × .45. Data.--Dayton, Oregon, May\r\n28, 1906. Nest of hair and fur in willow stub, 10 feet up.\r\n\r\n\r\n741a. CALIFORNIA CHICKADEE. _Penthestes rufescens neglectus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Coast regions of California.\r\n\r\nThis variety is not as rufous on the sides as the more northern one. Its\r\nhabits and eggs are the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n741b. BARLOW'S CHICKADEE. _Penthestes rufescens barlowi_.\r\n\r\nRange.--About Monterey Bay, California.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said to have no rusty on the flanks. Its habits and eggs\r\nare like those of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n742a. PALLID WREN-TIT. _Chamæa fasciata henshawi_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of California from Lower California to the Sacramento\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nThis duller colored variety has the same nesting habits and similar eggs\r\nto those of the Coast Wren-tit.\r\n\r\n\r\n742b. Coast Wren-Tit. _Chamæa fasciata fasciata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from southern California north to Oregon.\r\n\r\nThese peculiar brownish gray colored birds frequent the tangled\r\nunderbrush of ravines and mountain sides where they lead the life of a\r\nrecluse. They nest at low elevations in the densest thickets, making\r\nthem of twigs, strips of bark, grasses and feathers, compactly woven\r\ntogether and located in bushes from one to four feet from the ground.\r\nThey lay from three to five plain, unmarked, pure white eggs; size .75 ×\r\n.54. Data.--Wrights, Cal. Nest in a tangle of vines in a deep ravine;\r\ncomposed of strips of bark, moss and grasses, lined with cattle hair; a\r\nbulky nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n743. BUSH-TIT. _Psaltriparus minimus minimus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of northern California, Oregon and Washington.\r\n\r\nThese diminutive little birds build nests that are marvels of\r\narchitecture, making long purse-like structures, suspended from twigs\r\nusually at low elevations from the ground. The nests are made of moss,\r\nlichens, fibres, ferns and grasses and lined with feathers or wool; the\r\nopening is on one side near the top, and a typical nest averages 12\r\ninches in length, by 4.5 inches in diameter at the bottom and 3 at the\r\ntop. Their eggs number from four to nine and are pure white; size .54 ×\r\n.40. The birds are very active and have the same habits as the\r\nChickadees, being seen often suspended, head downward, from the ends of\r\ntwigs, in their search for insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 439: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 438\r\n\r\n743a. CALIFORNIA BUSH-TIT. _Psaltriparus minimus californicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--California with the exception of the northern part.\r\n\r\nThis sub-species, which is like the last but with a lighter brown head,\r\nhas the same habits, nests in the same manner and its eggs are not\r\ndistinguishable from those of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n743b. GRINDA'S BUSH-TIT. _Psaltriparus minimus grindæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this variety, which is very similar to the last,\r\ndo not vary in any respect; eggs indistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n744. LEAD-COLORED BUSH-TIT. _Psaltriparus plumbeus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region from Wyoming south to Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis species suspends its semi-pensile nests in bushes or trees, and\r\nsome times from the mistletoe, which grows on numerous trees in southern\r\nArizona. The nests are composed like those of the Cal. Bush-Tit and\r\nrange from 6 to 10 inches in length. The eggs are white, five or six in\r\nnumber and measure .55 × .42.\r\n\r\n\r\n745. LLOYD'S BUSH-TIT. _Psaltriparus melanotis lloydi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Mexico north into western Texas and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis species is similar to the lead-colored Bush-Tit but has the ear\r\ncoverts glossy black. Like the others, it builds a long pensile nest of\r\nsimilar material and suspended from the extremities of limbs near the\r\nground The five to seven eggs are pure white. Size .58 × .42.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 440: E. L. Bickford. BUSH-TIT AND NEST.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 439\r\n\r\n746. VERDIN. _Auriparus flaviceps flaviceps_.\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican border of the United States, north to Colorado and\r\nNevada.\r\n\r\nThis Bush-Tit has a bright yellow head and throat, the upper parts being\r\ngray and the belly, white. They are abundant in chaparral brush, locally\r\nthroughout their range. Their large globular nests are situated in\r\nbushes at low elevations from the ground, and are made of twigs and\r\nweeds, softly lined with fur and feathers. Their three to six eggs are\r\npale greenish blue, specked and dotted with reddish brown. Size .58 ×\r\n.44. Data.--Brownsville, Texas, May 8, 1894. Large nest of sticks and\r\nthorns, lined with hair and feathers, and located in a bush in brush\r\nthicket, 8 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n746a. CAPE VERDIN. _Auriparus flaviceps lamprocephalus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis new sub-species is said to have shorter wings and tail, and also to\r\nbe brighter yellow on the head. Its habits and eggs will not differ from\r\nthose of the common Verdin or Yellow-headed Bush-Tit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARBLERS, KINGLETS and GNATCATCHERS. Family SYLVIIDÆ\r\n\r\n747. KENNICOTT'S WILLOW WARBLER. _Acanthopneuste borealis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Asia, casually found in Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis species breeds in the extreme northern parts of Asia, and I believe\r\nits eggs have never been found on this continent. They build their nests\r\nof moss and grasses, on the ground in open woods, concealing them under\r\ntufts of grass or tussocks of earth. The three to five eggs are white,\r\nspotted with pale reddish brown. Size .70 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n748. GOLDEN-CROWNED KINGLET. _Regulus satrapa satrapa._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from northern United States northward,\r\nand south in the Rockies to Mexico, and in the Alleghanies to the\r\nCarolinas; winters throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThis rugged little fellow appears to be perfectly content in our\r\nnorthern states even during the most severe winters and leaves us early\r\nin the spring for his breeding grounds farther north. They are usually\r\nfound in company with Chickadees and, like them, may be seen hanging to\r\ntwigs in all sorts of positions as they search for their meagre fare.\r\nTheir nests are large, round structures of green moss, bark strips and\r\nfine rootlets, very thickly lined with soft feathers; these are placed\r\nin forks or partially suspended among the branches of spruce trees,\r\nusually high above the ground. During June they lay from five to ten\r\neggs of a dull whitish or grayish color, spotted heavily with pale brown\r\nand lilac. Size .55 × .42.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 441: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Verdin.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: Gray.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 440\r\n\r\n748a. WESTERN GOLDEN-CROWNED KINGLET. _Regulas satrapa olivaceus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from southern California to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said to be brighter colored than the last; its habits\r\nand eggs are the same in all particulars.\r\n\r\n749. RUBY-CROWNED KINGLET. _Regulus calendula calendula._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America, breeding from the northern border of the United\r\nStates northward, and farther south in mountain ranges; winters in\r\nsouthern United States.\r\n\r\nThis little bird is of the size of the Golden-crowned Kinglet (4.25\r\ninches long) and has a partially concealed patch of red on the crown,\r\nnot bordered by black and yellow as is the last species. Their nests are\r\nsimilar in construction to those of the last species and are situated in\r\nconiferous trees at any altitude from the ground. Their four to nine\r\neggs are creamy white, finely specked with reddish brown. Size .56 ×\r\n.44.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 442: Golden-crowned Kinglets.]\r\n[Illustration: White.]\r\n[Illustration: C. A. Smith. NEST AND EGGS OF BLUE-GRAY GNATCATCHER.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 441\r\n\r\n749A. SITKA KINGLET. _Regulas calendula grinnelli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast, breeding in Alaska.\r\n\r\nSaid to be brighter than the preceding variety.\r\n\r\n749b. DUSKY KINGLET. _Regulus calendula obscurus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Guadalupe Island, Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis species nests during March in the large cypress and pine groves at\r\nhigh elevations above the ground. The nests are similar in construction\r\nto those of the common Ruby-crown, and the eggs are scarcely different\r\nfrom some specimens of that species; white, dotted and wreathed with\r\nreddish brown. Size .56 × .43.\r\n\r\n\r\n751. BLUE-GRAY GNATCATCHER. _Polioptila cærulea cærulea._\r\n\r\nRange.--United States, east of the Rockies, breeding from the Gulf to\r\nthe Middle and Central States; casually north to Massachusetts and\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nThese graceful birds are bluish gray above with a black forehead and\r\ncentral tail feathers, and white underparts. They are common in wooded\r\ndistricts in the south, where they saddle their beautiful nests upon\r\nhorizontal branches or in crotches usually at quite an elevation from\r\nthe ground; they resemble large Ruby-throated Hummers' nests but the\r\nwalls are much higher and thicker; they are made of plant fibres and\r\ndown, lined with cottony substances and hair, and covered on the outside\r\nwith lichens to match the limb upon which it is placed. Their eggs are\r\nbluish white, specked with reddish chestnut. Size .58 × .45.\r\nData.--Chattanooga, Tenn., April 30, 1900. Nest of moss, covered with\r\nlichens and lined with hair and feathers; 20 feet from the ground in a\r\nsmall tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n751a. WESTERN GNATCATCHER. _Polioptila cærulea obscura._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States and Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe habits and eggs of this sub-species are the same as those of the\r\neastern bird, and the nests do not differ except, perhaps, in less\r\nornamentation of the exterior.\r\n\r\n\r\n752. PLUMBEOUS GNATCATCHER. _Polioptila plumbea._\r\n\r\nRange.--Mexican boundary from western Texas to southern California.\r\n\r\nThis species has a bright shining black crown and more black on the tail\r\nthan the eastern Gnatcatcher. They saddle their nests upon the branches\r\nof trees or in upright forks, usually at an elevation of ten feet or\r\nmore from the ground; the nests are made of plant fibres and fine bark\r\nstrips, compactly felted together, and with little, if any, ornamental\r\nlichens on the exterior. Their eggs are pale greenish blue, spotted with\r\nreddish brown, and vary from three to five in number. Size .54 × .44.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 443: Ruby-crowned Kinglet.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 442\r\n\r\n753. BLACK-TAILED GNATCATCHER. _Polioptila californica._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of southern California and northern Lower\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThis bird is very similar to the last but has still less white on the\r\nouter tail feathers. Like the last, the nests of this species usually\r\nlack the exterior covering of lichens, being made of vegetable fibres\r\nand plant down, firmly quilted together and saddled on horizontal limbs\r\nor placed in forks of trees at any height from the ground. Their eggs\r\nare grayish white, specked with bright reddish brown. Size .55 × .44.\r\nData.--Escondido, Cal., May 17, 1903. 5 eggs. Nest on a large limb of a\r\nsycamore, 30 feet above ground; made of weed fibres, etc., lined with\r\nhair and fine fibres.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRUSHES, SOLITAIRES, BLUEBIRDS, ETC. Family TURDIDAE\r\n\r\n754. TOWNSEND'S SOLITAIRE. _Myadestes townsendi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Western United States, breeding from Arizona, New Mexico and\r\nsouthern California north to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis unique species is of a uniform brownish gray color, with a white\r\neye ring, narrow bar on wing, and outer tail feathers, and with the\r\nbases of the primaries rusty colored. It is a ground inhabiting bird,\r\nfeeding upon insects and berries in shrubbery and thickets. Their song\r\nis said to be liquid, melodious and often long continued, equaling that\r\nof any other bird. They nest on the ground in hollows under banks or\r\ncrevices about roots of trees or fallen stumps, making a large, loosely\r\nconstructed pile of weeds and trash, hollowed and lined with rootlets.\r\nThe three or four eggs, which are laid in June, are grayish white,\r\nspotted with pale brown, chiefly or most abundantly about the large end.\r\nSize .96 × .70.\r\n\r\n\r\n755. WOOD THRUSH. _Hylocichla mustelina._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from North Carolina and Kansas\r\nnorth to northern United States; winters south of our borders.\r\n\r\nThis Thrush with his brightly spotted breast is the most handsome of\r\nthis group of musical birds. They are common in damp woods and thickets,\r\nin which places they breed, placing their nests of straw, leaves and\r\ngrasses in low trees usually between four and ten feet from the ground;\r\ntheir nests are often very rustic, being ornamented by pieces of paper\r\nand twigs with dead leaves attached hanging from the sides of the quite\r\nbulky structures. During May or June they lay three or four greenish\r\nblue eggs of about the shade of a Robin's. Size 1.05 × .70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 444: Blue-gray Gnatcatcher.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Grayish white.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 443\r\n\r\n756. VEERY. _Hylocichla fuscescens fuscescens._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding in the northern half of its\r\nUnited States range and in the southern British Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe Veery is very abundantly distributed in woodland, either moist or\r\ndry, and nests on the ground or within a very few inches of it, usually\r\nplacing its structures of woven bark strips and grasses, in the midst of\r\na clump of sprouts or ferns. The three or four eggs which they lay in\r\nMay or June are bluish green, much darker than those of the Wood Thrush,\r\nand nearly the color of those of the Catbird. Size .90 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n756a. WILLOW THRUSH. _Hylocichla fuscescens salicicola._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region, north to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe nests and eggs of this similar bird do not differ from those of the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\r\n757. GRAY-CHEEKED THRUSH. _Hylocichla aliciæ aliciæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds from Labrador to Alaska; winters south to Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this species are very similar to those of\r\nthe following sub-species and the same description will answer for both.\r\n\r\n\r\n757. BICKNELL'S THRUSH. _Hylocichla aliciæ bicknelli._\r\n\r\nRange.--Breeds in the Catskills, White Mountains and Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nThese birds, which are practically identical with the preceding, build\r\ntheir nests at low elevations in trees, usually evergreens when present,\r\nmaking them of twigs, moss and rootlets, lined with fine grasses. The\r\neggs, which are laid during May or June, are pale greenish blue, spotted\r\nand blotched with pale brown or russet. Size .88 × .64. Data.--Seal\r\nIsland, Nova Scotia, June 3, 1901. Nest of green moss and rootlets, in a\r\nspruce, 5 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n758. RUSSET-BACKED THRUSH. _Hylocichla ustulata ustulata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast, breeding in Oregon and Alaska; winters in Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThis species is very abundant in moist thickets throughout its range,\r\nnesting in bushes and low trees, and making them of weed\r\n\r\n[Illustration 445: Wood Thrush.]\r\n[Illustration: Wilson's Thrush.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 444\r\n\r\n[Illustration 446: WOOD THRUSH.]\r\n\r\nPage 445\r\n\r\nstalks, bark strips, grasses and moss, lined with fine black rootlets.\r\nThey are found at elevations of from two to ten feet above the ground.\r\nLike the Wood Thrush the birds are tame while sitting on the nest and\r\nwill allow a very close approach, without taking alarm; nests are\r\nfrequently found which are made almost entirely out of green moss and\r\nare very handsome structures. Their three to five eggs are laid in May\r\nor June; they are greenish blue, spotted with brown of varying shades.\r\nSize .92 × .65. Data.--Eureka, California, July 6, 1899. Nest in a fir\r\ntree, 5 feet from the ground; made of moss and strips of redwood bark. 4\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n758a. OLIVE-BACKED THRUSH. _Hylocichla swainsoni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding chiefly north of the United\r\nStates, but locally in the northern parts, and abundantly in mountain\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this eastern representative of the last\r\nspecies are like those of that bird in all respects and the eggs cannot\r\nbe distinguished from those of _ustulatus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n758b. OLIVE-BACKED THRUSH. _Hylocichla œdica_.\r\n\r\nRange.--California and southern Oregon.\r\n\r\nNesting habits and eggs identical with those of _ustulatus._\r\n\r\n\r\n759. ALASKA HERMIT THRUSH. _Hylocichla guttata guttata._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from British Columbia to Alaska. Winters in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThe Hermit Thrushes can readily be identified from any other by the\r\nreddish brown tail which is in marked contrast to the color of the back.\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this species are precisely like those of\r\nthe eastern Hermit Thrush, which is a sub-species of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n759a. AUDUBON'S HERMIT THRUSH. _Hylocichla guttata auduboni._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Winters in Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits of this bird are like those of the next except that\r\nit more frequently nests in bushes above the ground. The eggs are not\r\ndistinctive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 447: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Gray-cheeked Thrush. Olive-backed Thrush.]\r\n[Illustration: deco.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 446\r\n\r\n759b. HERMIT THRUSH. _Hylocichla guttata pallasi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern North America, breeding in northern United States and\r\nnorth to Labrador; winters in southern United States.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is noted for its sweet and musical song, frequents\r\ndamp swamps and thickets where it builds its nest either on the ground\r\nor near it, like that of the Wilson Thrush; it is made of shreds of\r\nbark, grasses, leaves and rootlets, lined with fine rootlets; the three\r\nor four eggs, which are deposited in May or June, are bluish green and\r\ncannot, with certainty, be distinguished from those of the Veery; size\r\n.85 × .65.\r\n\r\n\r\n759c. DWARF HERMIT THRUSH. _Hylocichla guttata nanus._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast of United States, from Washington, southward.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits and eggs of this slightly smaller and duller colored\r\nvariety are like those of the other Hermit Thrushes.\r\n\r\n\r\n760. RED-WINGED THRUSH. _Turdus musicus._\r\n\r\nRange.--An Old World species, accidentally straying to Greenland.\r\n\r\nThis common European bird nests at low elevations in bushes or trees,\r\nlaying four or five bluish green eggs, spotted with reddish brown; size\r\n1.05 × .75.\r\n\r\n\r\n761. ROBIN. _Planesticus migratorius migratorius._\r\n\r\nRange.--North America east of the Rockies, breeding from the middle\r\nportions of the United States, north to the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThese common birds nest in trees about houses, in orchards, open woods,\r\nin corners of fences, on blinds on houses, and in fact almost every\r\nconceivable position. Their nests are made of grasses, firmly cemented\r\ntogether with mud and lined with finer grasses; when placed in trees\r\nthey are generally firmly saddled in crotches and may be found at any\r\nheight, from on the ground to sixty feet above it. Their eggs are\r\ngreenish blue; size 1.15 × .80. Eggs may be found at any time from May\r\nuntil July or August as they raise several broods a season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 448: Hermit Thrush.]\r\n[Illustration: Bluish green.]\r\n[Illustration: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: American Robin.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 447\r\n\r\n761b. SOUTHERN ROBIN. _Planesticus migratorius achrusterus._\r\n\r\nRange.--The Carolinas and Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this bird, which is said to be smaller and duller colored\r\nthan the northern variety, show no differences in any respect.\r\n\r\n762. SAN LUCAS ROBIN. _Planesticus confinis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Southern Lower California.\r\n\r\nThis is a very much paler form of the American Robin; its eggs probably\r\nwill not differ from those of the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 449: J. B. Pardoe. NEST AND EGGS OF ROBIN.]\r\n[Illustration: right hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 448\r\n\r\n763. VARIED THRUSH. _Ixoreus nævius nævius._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from northern California to Alaska; south to\r\nMexico in winter.\r\n\r\nThese handsome birds breed abundantly in Alaska and locally in mountain\r\nranges south to northern California. They nest at low elevations in\r\ntrees, making them of moss, twigs, weeds and grasses, forming a flat\r\nshallow structure. Their eggs are greenish blue sharply but sparingly\r\nspotted with dark brown; size 1.12 × .80. Data.--Delta of Kowak River,\r\nAlaska, June 11, 1899. Four eggs. Nest 12 feet from the ground, against\r\nthe trunk of a slender spruce and supported by a clump of stiff twigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n763a. NORTHERN VARIED THRUSH. _Ixoreus nævius meruloides._\r\n\r\nRange.--Interior of western North America, breeding from British\r\nColumbia to Alaska. Its habits and eggs do not differ from those of the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\r\n764. SIBERIAN RED-SPOTTED BLUETHROAT. _Cyanosylvia suecica robusta._\r\n\r\nRange.--Northern Asia; casually to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful foreigner nests on the ground and lays four to six\r\ngreenish blue eggs, spotted with reddish brown; size .75 × .50.\r\n\r\n\r\n765. WHEATEAR. _Saxicola œnanthe œnanthe._\r\n\r\nRange.--Asia; casual in Alaska in summer; nesting habits and eggs like\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\n\r\n765a. GREENLAND WHEATEAR. _Saxicola œnanthe leucorhoa._\r\n\r\nRange.--Europe and Greenland; casual on the Atlantic coast of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThis very abundant Old World species is a common breeding bird in\r\nGreenland and probably also in Labrador. They nest in crevices of\r\nquarries, holes in the ground, or stone walls, making a rude nest of\r\nweeds, moss or grasses, lined with hair or feathers, and during May lay\r\nfrom four to six pale greenish blue eggs; size .90 × .60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 450: Greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: Wheatear.]\r\n[Illustration: Pale greenish blue.]\r\n[Illustration: left hand margin.]\r\n\r\nPage 449\r\n\r\n[Illustration 451: BLUEBIRD.]\r\n\r\nPage 450\r\n\r\n766. BLUEBIRD. _Sialia sialis sialis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to southern\r\nCanada. Winters in the southern half of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese familiar birds build in cavities in trees, usually below 20 feet\r\nfrom the ground, crevices among ledges, bird boxes and in any suitable\r\nnook they may discover about buildings, providing that English Sparrows\r\ndo not molest them. They raise several broods a year, commencing in\r\nApril when they lay from three to six pale bluish white eggs (rarely\r\npure white); size .80 × .60. The cavities of their nesting sites are\r\nlined with grasses and feathers usually, although I have found the eggs\r\non the unlined bottom of cavities in trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n766a. AZURE BLUEBIRD. _Sialia sialis fulva._\r\n\r\nRange.--This pale variety is found in southern Arizona and southward.\r\n\r\nIts nesting habits are the same and the eggs are indistinguishable from\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\r\n767. WESTERN BLUEBIRD. _Sialia mexicana occidentalis._\r\n\r\nRange.--Pacific coast from Lower California to British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe Western Bluebird is as common and familiar in its range as the\r\ncommon Bluebird is in the east. It nests in similar locations and its\r\neggs are scarcely distinguishable, although averaging a trifle darker in\r\nshade; size .80 × .60.\r\n\r\n\r\n767a. CHESTNUT-BACKED BLUEBIRD. _Sialia mexicana bairdi._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region from Mexico to Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe nesting habits or eggs of this brighter colored bird do not differ\r\nfrom those of the last species.\r\n\r\n\r\n767b. SAN PEDRO BLUEBIRD. _Sialia mexicana anabelæ._\r\n\r\nRange.--San Pedro Martir Mountains in Lower California.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this variety will not in all probability be any different\r\nfrom those of the preceding Bluebirds.\r\n\r\n\r\n768. MOUNTAIN BLUEBIRD. _Sialia currucoides._\r\n\r\nRange.--Rocky Mountain region, breeding from New Mexico north to Great\r\nSlave Lake; winters in southwestern United States and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis azure blue species is common in the greater part of its range and\r\nis found west to the Sierra Nevadas in California. Like the eastern\r\nBluebird they nest in holes in trees or anywhere that they can find a\r\nsuitable cavity or crevice. Their eggs are slightly larger than those of\r\nthe other Bluebirds and have a slight greenish tint; size .85 × .64.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 452: Bluish white.]\r\n[Illustration:

REED, B. S.\r\n\r\nThis book is destined to be one of the most important that the author\r\nhas written. Absorbingly interesting in itself, yet its greatest value\r\nwill lie in the fact that it will lead the reader to realize how blind\r\nhe has been to the many wonderful things that are happening on every\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe brook, the pond, the field, the woods, the swamps and even the back\r\nyards yield quantities of very interesting subjects for study. This book\r\ntreats entertainingly of many of these interesting creatures, but its\r\nchief aim is to be an \"awakener\"--to arouse within the reader the desire\r\nto go out and verify some of the facts given, or to do some original\r\ninvestigation himself. Such studies develop the senses of perception and\r\nobservation immensely, and the one who is \"alive\" to what is going on\r\nabout him surely is better able to cope with all situations in life than\r\none who sees nothing until it is forcibly brought to his attention.\r\n\r\n112 pages; size--5½ × 7½ in. 40 illustrations in color, and black and\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n60c. net; postage 10c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 479\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 481]\r\n\r\nCamera Studies of Wild Birds in Their Homes\r\n\r\nBy CHESTER A. REED, B. S.\r\n\r\n\"CAMERA STUDIES\" affords everyone an opportunity for a very intimate\r\nstudy of bird life. A good photograph of an event together with an\r\ninteresting description of it is the next best thing to witnessing the\r\nevent itself.\r\n\r\n\"CAMERA STUDIES\" has 250 photographs of events right in birds' home.\r\nThese pictures are selected from the author's collection of over 2000\r\nbird photographs, this being one of the best collections of pictures of\r\nfree, living wild birds in existence.\r\n\r\nMany rare and interesting poses are faithfully shown by the camera. For\r\ninstance, a pair of adult Chipping Sparrows, standing on a branch by the\r\nsides of their four young, are engaged in pulling apart a large worm\r\nthat was too large to be given whole.\r\n\r\nThe stories accompanying these pictures are as interesting as the\r\nphotographs and above all they are all actual facts.\r\n\r\n300 pages, 5½ × 7½ in.; 250 photographs of living, wild birds.\r\n\r\nHandsomely bound in Cloth, $2.00 net; postage 20c.\r\n\r\nWestern Bird Guide\r\n\r\nThis new book, a companion and uniform in size to the Bird and Flower\r\nGuides East of the Rockies, is much more complete and shows every\r\nspecies of bird, BOTH LAND AND WATER to be found IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS\r\nand westward to the PACIFIC COAST, and from Mexico north to the Arctic\r\nregions.
