Having, in his own experience as a teacher, felt\r\nthe need of a book different from any now in use, the author has\r\nprepared the present volume with a hope that it may serve the purpose\r\nfor which it is intended; viz., an introduction to the study of botany\r\nfor use in high schools especially, but sufficiently comprehensive to\r\nserve also as a beginning book in most colleges.\r\n\r\nIt does not pretend to be a complete treatise of the whole science,\r\nand this, it is hoped, will be sufficient apology for the absence from\r\nits pages of many important subjects, especially physiological topics.\r\nIt was found impracticable to compress within the limits of a book of\r\nmoderate size anything like a thorough discussion of even the most\r\nimportant topics of _all_ the departments of botany. As a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the structure of any organism forms the basis of all\r\nfurther intelligent study of the same, it has seemed to the author\r\nproper to emphasize this feature in the present work, which is\r\nprofessedly an _introduction_, only, to the science.\r\n\r\nThis structural work has been supplemented by so much classification\r\nas will serve to make clear the relationships of different groups, and\r\nthe principles upon which the classification is based, as well as\r\nenable the student to recognize the commoner types of the different\r\ngroups as they are met with. The aim of this book is not, however,\r\nmerely the identification of plants. We wish here to enter a strong\r\nprotest against the only too prevalent idea that the chief aim of\r\nbotany is the ability to run down a plant by means of an \"Analytical\r\nKey,\" the subject being exhausted as soon as the name of the plant is\r\ndiscovered. A knowledge of the plant itself is far more important than\r\nits name, however desirable it may be to know the latter.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the plants employed as examples of the different groups,\r\nsuch were chosen, as far as possible, as are everywhere common. Of\r\ncourse this was not always possible, as some important forms, _e.g._\r\nthe red and brown seaweeds, are necessarily not always readily\r\nprocurable by all students, but it will be found that the great\r\nmajority of the forms used, or closely related ones, are within the\r\nreach of nearly all students; and such directions are given for\r\ncollecting and preserving them as will make it possible even for those\r\nin the larger cities to supply themselves with the necessary\r\nmaterials. Such directions, too, for the manipulation and examination\r\nof specimens are given as will make the book, it is hoped, a\r\nlaboratory guide as well as a manual of classification. Indeed, it is\r\nprimarily intended that the book should so serve as a help in the\r\nstudy of the actual specimens.\r\n\r\nAlthough much can be done in the study, even of the lowest plants,\r\nwithout microscopic aid other than a hand lens, for a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the structure of any plant a good compound microscope\r\nis indispensable, and wherever it is possible the student should be\r\nprovided with such an instrument, to use this book to the best\r\nadvantage. As, however, many are not able to have the use of a\r\nmicroscope, the gross anatomy of all the forms described has been\r\ncarefully treated for the especial benefit of such students. Such\r\nportions of the text, as well as the general discussions, are printed\r\nin ordinary type, while the minute anatomy, and all points requiring\r\nmicroscopic aid, are discussed in separate paragraphs printed in\r\nsmaller type.\r\n\r\nThe drawings, with very few exceptions, which are duly credited, were\r\ndrawn from nature by the author, and nearly all expressly for this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nA list of the most useful books of reference is appended, all of which\r\nhave been more or less consulted in the preparation of the following\r\npages.\r\n\r\nThe classification adopted is, with slight changes, that given in\r\nGoebel's \"Outlines of Morphology and Classification\"; while, perhaps,\r\nnot in all respects entirely satisfactory, it seems to represent more\r\nnearly than any other our present knowledge of the subject. Certain\r\ngroups, like the Diatoms and _Characeæ_, are puzzles to the botanist,\r\nand at present it is impossible to give them more than a provisional\r\nplace in the system.\r\n\r\nIf this volume serves to give the student some comprehension of the\r\nreal aims of botanical science, and its claims to be something more\r\nthan the \"Analysis\" of flowers, it will have fulfilled its mission.\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS H.

While it is\r\nimpossible, owing to the dependence of all organized matter upon\r\ninorganic matter, to give an absolute definition, we at once recognize\r\nthe peculiarities of organic or living bodies as distinguished from\r\ninorganic or non-living ones. All living bodies feed, grow, and\r\nreproduce, these acts being the result of the action of forces\r\nresident within the organism. Inorganic bodies, on the other hand,\r\nremain, as a rule, unchanged so long as they are not acted upon by\r\nexternal forces.\r\n\r\nAll living organisms are dependent for existence upon inorganic\r\nmatter, and sooner or later return these elements to the sources\r\nwhence they came. Thus, a plant extracts from the earth and air\r\ncertain inorganic compounds which are converted by the activity of the\r\nplant into a part of its own substance, becoming thus incorporated\r\ninto a living organism. After the plant dies, however, it undergoes\r\ndecomposition, and the elements are returned again to the earth and\r\natmosphere from which they were taken.\r\n\r\nInvestigation has shown that living bodies contain comparatively few\r\nelements, but these are combined into extraordinarily complex\r\ncompounds. The following elements appear to be essential to all living\r\nbodies: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, potassium.\r\nBesides these there are several others usually present, but not\r\napparently essential to all organisms. These include phosphorus, iron,\r\ncalcium, sodium, magnesium, chlorine, silicon.\r\n\r\nAs we examine more closely the structure and functions of organic\r\nbodies, an extraordinary uniformity is apparent in all of them. This\r\nis disguised in the more specialized forms, but in the simpler ones is\r\nvery apparent. Owing to this any attempt to separate absolutely the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms proves futile.\r\n\r\nThe science that treats of living things, irrespective of the\r\ndistinction between plant and animal, is called \"Biology,\" but for\r\nmany purposes it is desirable to recognize the distinctions, making\r\ntwo departments of Biology,--Botany, treating of plants; and Zoölogy,\r\nof animals. It is with the first of these only that we shall concern\r\nourselves here.\r\n\r\nWhen one takes up a plant his attention is naturally first drawn to\r\nits general appearance and structure, whether it is a complicated one\r\nlike one of the flowering plants, or some humbler member of the\r\nvegetable kingdom,--a moss, seaweed, toadstool,--or even some still\r\nsimpler plant like a mould, or the apparently structureless green scum\r\nthat floats on a stagnant pond. In any case the impulse is to\r\ninvestigate the form and structure as far as the means at one's\r\ndisposal will permit. Such a study of structure constitutes\r\n\"Morphology,\" which includes two departments,--gross anatomy, or a\r\ngeneral study of the parts; and minute anatomy, or \"Histology,\" in\r\nwhich a microscopic examination is made of the structure of the\r\ndifferent parts. A special department of Morphology called\r\n\"Embryology\" is often recognized. This embraces a study of the\r\ndevelopment of the organism from its earliest stage, and also the\r\ndevelopment of its different members.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of the structure of organisms we get a clue to their\r\nrelationships, and upon the basis of such relationships are enabled to\r\nclassify them or unite them into groups so as to indicate the degree\r\nto which they are related. This constitutes the division of Botany\r\nusually known as Classification or \"Systematic Botany.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, we may study the functions or workings of an organism: how it\r\nfeeds, breathes, moves, reproduces. This is \"Physiology,\" and like\r\nclassification must be preceded by a knowledge of the structures\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nFor the study of the gross anatomy of plants the following articles\r\nwill be found of great assistance: 1. a sharp knife, and for more\r\ndelicate tissues, a razor; 2. a pair of small, fine-pointed scissors;\r\n3. a pair of mounted needles (these can be made by forcing ordinary\r\nsewing needles into handles of pine or other soft wood); 4. a hand\r\nlens; 5. drawing-paper and pencil, and a note book.\r\n\r\nFor the study of the lower plants, as well as the histology of the\r\nhigher ones, a compound microscope is indispensable. Instruments with\r\nlenses magnifying from about 20 to 500 diameters can be had at a cost\r\nvarying from about $20 to $30, and are sufficient for any ordinary\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nObjects to be studied with the compound microscope are usually\r\nexamined by transmitted light, and must be transparent enough to allow\r\nthe light to pass through. The objects are placed upon small glass\r\nslips (slides), manufactured for the purpose, and covered with\r\nextremely thin plates of glass, also specially made. If the body to be\r\nexamined is a large one, thin slices or sections must be made. This\r\nfor most purposes may be done with an ordinary razor. Most plant\r\ntissues are best examined ordinarily in water, though of course\r\nspecimens so mounted cannot be preserved for any length of time.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] For the mounting of permanent preparations, see Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the implements used in studying the gross anatomy, the\r\nfollowing will be found useful in histological work: 1. a small\r\ncamel's-hair brush for picking up small sections and putting water in\r\nthe slides; 2. small forceps for handling delicate objects; 3.\r\nblotting paper for removing superfluous water from the slides and\r\ndrawing fluids under the cover glass; 4. pieces of elder or sunflower\r\npith, for holding small objects while making sections.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these implements, a few reagents may be recommended for\r\nthe simpler histological work. The most important of these are\r\nalcohol, glycerine, potash (a strong solution of potassium hydrate in\r\nwater), iodine (either a little of the commercial tincture of iodine\r\nin water, or, better, a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium),\r\nacetic acid, and some staining fluid. (An aqueous or alcoholic\r\nsolution of gentian violet or methyl violet is one of the best.)\r\n\r\nA careful record should be kept by the student of all work done, both\r\nby means of written notes and drawings. For most purposes pencil\r\ndrawings are most convenient, and these should be made with a\r\nmoderately soft pencil on unruled paper. If it is desired to make the\r\ndrawings with ink, a careful outline should first be made with a hard\r\npencil and this inked over with India-ink or black drawing ink. Ink\r\ndrawings are best made upon light bristol board with a hard,\r\nsmooth-finished surface.\r\n\r\nWhen obtainable, the student will do best to work with freshly\r\ngathered specimens; but as these are not always to be had when wanted,\r\na few words about gathering and preserving material may be of service.\r\n\r\nMost of the lower green plants (_algæ_) may be kept for a long time in\r\nglass jars or other vessels, provided care is taken to remove all\r\ndead specimens at first and to renew the water from time to time. They\r\nusually thrive best in a north window where they get little or no\r\ndirect sunshine, and it is well to avoid keeping them too warm.\r\n\r\nNumbers of the most valuable fungi--_i.e._ the lower plants that are\r\nnot green--grow spontaneously on many organic substances that are kept\r\nwarm and moist. Fresh bread kept moist and covered with a glass will\r\nin a short time produce a varied crop of moulds, and fresh horse\r\nmanure kept in the same way serves to support a still greater number\r\nof fungi.\r\n\r\nMosses, ferns, etc., can be raised with a little care, and of course\r\nvery many flowering plants are readily grown in pots.\r\n\r\nMost of the smaller parasitic fungi (rusts, mildews, etc.) may be kept\r\ndry for any length of time, and on moistening with a weak solution of\r\ncaustic potash will serve nearly as well as freshly gathered specimens\r\nfor most purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to preserve as perfectly as possible the more\r\ndelicate plant structures for future study, strong alcohol is the best\r\nand most convenient preserving agent. Except for loss of color it\r\npreserves nearly all plant tissues perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we make a thin slice across the stem of a rapidly growing\r\nplant,--_e.g._ geranium, begonia, celery,--mount it in water, and\r\nexamine it microscopically, it will be found to be made up of numerous\r\ncavities or chambers separated by delicate partitions. Often these\r\ncavities are of sufficient size to be visible to the naked eye, and\r\nexamined with a hand lens the section appears like a piece of fine\r\nlace, each mesh being one of the chambers visible when more strongly\r\nmagnified. These chambers are known as \"cells,\" and of them the whole\r\nplant is built up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--A single cell from a hair on the stamen of the\r\ncommon spiderwort (_Tradescantia_), × 150. _pr._ protoplasm; _w_, cell\r\nwall; _n_, nucleus.]\r\n\r\n  In order to study the structure of the cell more exactly we will\r\n  select such as may be examined without cutting them. A good example\r\n  is furnished by the common spiderwort (Fig. 1). Attached to the base\r\n  of the stamens (Fig. 85, _B_) are delicate hairs composed of chains\r\n  of cells, which may be examined alive by carefully removing a stamen\r\n  and placing it in a drop of water under a cover glass. Each cell\r\n  (Fig. 1) is an oblong sac, with a delicate colorless wall which\r\n  chemical tests show to be composed of cellulose, a substance closely\r\n  resembling starch. Within this sac, and forming a lining to it, is\r\n  a thin layer of colorless matter containing many fine granules.\r\n  Bands and threads of the same substance traverse the cavity of the\r\n  cell, which is filled with a deep purple homogeneous fluid. This\r\n  fluid, which in most cells is colorless, is called the cell sap, and\r\n  is composed mainly of water. Imbedded in the granular lining of the\r\n  sac is a roundish body (_n_), which itself has a definite membrane,\r\n  and usually shows one or more roundish bodies within, besides an\r\n  indistinctly granular appearance. This body is called the nucleus of\r\n  the cell, and the small one within it, the nucleolus.\r\n\r\n  The membrane surrounding the cell is known as the cell wall, and in\r\n  young plant cells is always composed of cellulose.\r\n\r\n  The granular substance lining the cell wall (Fig. 1, _pr._) is\r\n  called \"protoplasm,\" and with the nucleus constitutes the living\r\n  part of the cell. If sufficiently magnified, the granules within the\r\n  protoplasm will be seen to be in active streaming motion. This\r\n  movement, which is very evident here, is not often so conspicuous,\r\n  but still may often be detected without difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--An _Amœba_. A cell without a cell wall. _n_,\r\nnucleus; _v_, vacuoles, × 300.]\r\n\r\nThe cell may be regarded as the unit of organic structure, and of\r\ncells are built up all of the complicated structures of which the\r\nbodies of the highest plants and animals are composed. We shall find\r\nthat the cells may become very much modified for various purposes, but\r\nat first they are almost identical in structure, and essentially the\r\nsame as the one we have just considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Hairs from the leaf stalk of a wild geranium.\r\n_A_, single-celled hair. _B_ and _C_, hairs consisting of a row of\r\ncells. The terminal rounded cell secretes a peculiar scented oil that\r\ngives the plant its characteristic odor. _B_, × 50; _C_, × 150.]\r\n\r\nVery many of the lower forms of life consist of but a single cell\r\nwhich may occasionally be destitute of a cell wall. Such a form is\r\nshown in Figure 2. Here we have a mass of protoplasm with a nucleus\r\n(_n_) and cavities (vacuoles, _v_) filled with cell sap, but no cell\r\nwall. The protoplasm is in constant movement, and by extensions of a\r\nportion of the mass and contraction of other parts, the whole creeps\r\nslowly along. Other naked cells (Fig. 12, _B_; Fig. 16, _C_) are\r\nprovided with delicate thread-like processes of protoplasm called\r\n\"cilia\" (sing. _cilium_), which are in active vibration, and propel\r\nthe cell through the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--_A_, cross section. _B_, longitudinal section\r\nof the leaf stalk of wild geranium, showing its cellular structure.\r\n_Ep._ epidermis. _h_, a hair, × 50. _C_, a cell from the prothallium\r\n(young plant) of a fern, × _150_. The contents of the cell contracted\r\nby the action of a solution of sugar.]\r\n\r\n  On placing a cell into a fluid denser than the cell sap (_e.g._ a\r\n  ten-per-cent solution of sugar in water), a portion of the water\r\n  will be extracted from the cell, and we shall then see the\r\n  protoplasm receding from the wall (Fig. 4, _C_), showing that it is\r\n  normally in a state of tension due to pressure from within of the\r\n  cell sap. The cell wall shows the same thing though in a less\r\n  degree, owing to its being much more rigid than the protoplasmic\r\n  lining. It is owing to the partial collapsing of the cells,\r\n  consequent on loss of water, that plants wither when the supply of\r\n  water is cut off.\r\n\r\nAs cells grow, new ones are formed in various ways. If the new cells\r\nremain together, cell aggregates, called tissues, are produced, and\r\nof these tissues are built up the various organs of the higher plants.\r\nThe simplest tissues are rows of cells, such as form the hairs\r\ncovering the surface of the organs of many flowering plants (Fig. 3),\r\nand are due to a division of the cells in a single direction. If the\r\ndivisions take place in three planes, masses of cells, such as make up\r\nthe stems, etc., of the higher plants, result (Fig. 4, _A_, _B_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS.--PROTOPHYTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenience it is desirable to collect into groups\r\nsuch plants as are evidently related; but as our knowledge of many\r\nforms is still very imperfect, any classification we may adopt must be\r\nto a great extent only provisional, and subject to change at any time,\r\nas new forms are discovered or others become better understood.\r\n\r\nThe following general divisions are usually accepted: I. Sub-kingdom\r\n(or Branch); II. Class; III. Order; IV. Family; V. Genus; VI. Species.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: The white pine belongs to the highest great division\r\n(sub-kingdom) of the plant kingdom. The plants of this division all\r\nproduce seeds, and hence are called \"spermaphytes\" (\"seed plants\").\r\nThey may be divided into two groups (classes), distinguished by\r\ncertain peculiarities in the flowers and seeds. These are named\r\nrespectively \"gymnosperms\" and \"angiosperms,\" and to the first our\r\nplant belongs. The gymnosperms may be further divided into several\r\nsubordinate groups (orders), one of which, the conifers, or\r\ncone-bearing evergreens, includes our plant. This order includes\r\nseveral families, among them the fir family (_Abietineæ_), including\r\nthe pines and firs. Of the sub-divisions (_genera_, sing. _genus_) of\r\nthe fir family, one of the most familiar is the genus _Pinus_, which\r\nembraces all the true pines. Comparing different kinds of pines, we\r\nfind that they differ in the form of the cones, arrangement of the\r\nleaves, and other minor particulars. The form we have selected differs\r\nfrom all other native forms in its cones, and also in having the\r\nleaves in fives, instead of twos or threes, as in most other kinds.\r\nTherefore to distinguish the white pine from all other pines, it is\r\ngiven a \"specific\" name, _strobus_.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show more plainly what is meant:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Sub-kingdom,\r\n                        _Spermaphyta_.\r\n         /--------------------^---------------------\\\r\n          Includes all spermaphytes, or seed plants.\r\n\r\n                            Class,\r\n                        _Gymnospermæ_.\r\n                 /------------^------------\\\r\n                   All naked-seeded plants.\r\n\r\n                            Order,\r\n                         _Coniferæ_.\r\n               /--------------^--------------\\\r\n                 All cone-bearing evergreens.\r\n\r\n                           Family,\r\n                         _Abietineæ_.\r\n                     /--------^--------\\\r\n                      Firs, Pines, etc.\r\n\r\n                            Genus,\r\n                           _Pinus_.\r\n                          /---^---\\\r\n                            Pines.\r\n\r\n                           Species,\r\n                          _Strobus_.\r\n                        /-----^-----\\\r\n                         White Pine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM I.\r\n\r\nPROTOPHYTES.\r\n\r\nThe name Protophytes (_Protophyta_) has been applied to a large number\r\nof simple plants, which differ a good deal among themselves. Some of\r\nthem differ strikingly from the higher plants, and resemble so\r\nremarkably certain low forms of animal life as to be quite\r\nindistinguishable from them, at least in certain stages. Indeed, there\r\nare certain forms that are quite as much animal as vegetable in their\r\nattributes, and must be regarded as connecting the two kingdoms. Such\r\nforms are the slime moulds (Fig. 5), _Euglena_ (Fig. 9), _Volvox_\r\n(Fig. 10), and others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--_A_, a portion of a slime mould growing on a\r\nbit of rotten wood, × 3. _B_, outline of a part of the same, × 25.\r\n_C_, a small portion showing the densely granular character of the\r\nprotoplasm, × 150. _D_, a group of spore cases of a slime mould\r\n(_Trichia_), of about the natural size. _E_, two spore cases, × 5.

At\r\ncertain stages they consist of naked masses of protoplasm of very\r\nconsiderable size, not infrequently several centimetres in diameter.\r\nThese are met with on decaying logs in damp woods, on rotting leaves,\r\nand other decaying vegetable matter. The commonest ones are bright\r\nyellow or whitish, and form soft, slimy coverings over the substratum\r\n(Fig. 5, _A_), penetrating into its crevices and showing sensitiveness\r\ntoward light. The plasmodium, as the mass of protoplasm is called, may\r\nbe made to creep upon a slide in the following way: A tumbler is\r\nfilled with water and placed in a saucer filled with sand. A strip of\r\nblotting paper about the width of the slide is now placed with one end\r\nin the water, the other hanging over the edge of the glass and against\r\none side of a slide, which is thus held upright, but must not be\r\nallowed to touch the side of the tumbler. The strip of blotting paper\r\nsucks up the water, which flows slowly down the surface of the slide\r\nin contact with the blotting paper. If now a bit of the substance upon\r\nwhich the plasmodium is growing is placed against the bottom of the\r\nslide on the side where the stream of water is, the protoplasm will\r\ncreep up against the current of water and spread over the slide,\r\nforming delicate threads in which most active streaming movements of\r\nthe central granular protoplasm may be seen under the microscope, and\r\nthe ends of the branches may be seen to push forward much as we saw in\r\nthe amœba. In order that the experiment may be successful, the whole\r\napparatus should be carefully protected from the light, and allowed to\r\nstand for several hours. This power of movement, as well as the power\r\nto take in solid food, are eminently animal characteristics, though\r\nthe former is common to many plants as well.\r\n\r\nAfter a longer or shorter time the mass of protoplasm contracts and\r\ngathers into little heaps, each of which develops into a structure\r\nthat has no resemblance to any animal, but would be at once placed\r\nwith plants. In one common form (_Trichia_) these are round or\r\npear-shaped bodies of a yellow color, and about as big as a pin head\r\n(Fig. 5, _D_), occurring in groups on rotten logs in damp woods.\r\nOthers are stalked (_Arcyria_, _Stemonitis_) (Fig. 5, _J_, _K_), and\r\nof various colors,--red, brown, etc. The outer part of the structure\r\nis a more or less firm wall, which breaks when ripe, discharging a\r\npowdery mass, mixed in most forms with very fine fibres.\r\n\r\n  When strongly magnified the fine dust is found to be made up of\r\n  innumerable small cells with thick walls, marked with ridges or\r\n  processes which differ much in different species. The fibres also\r\n  differ much in different genera. Sometimes they are simple,\r\n  hair-like threads; in others they are hollow tubes with spiral\r\n  thickenings, often very regularly placed, running around their\r\n  walls.\r\n\r\n  The spores may sometimes be made to germinate by placing them in a\r\n  drop of water, and allowing them to remain in a warm place for about\r\n  twenty-four hours. If the experiment has been successful, at the end\r\n  of this time the spore membrane will have burst, and the contents\r\n  escaped in the form of a naked mass of protoplasm (Zoöspore) with a\r\n  nucleus, and often showing a vacuole (Fig. 5, _v_), that\r\n  alternately becomes much distended, and then disappears entirely. On\r\n  first escaping it is usually provided with a long, whip-like\r\n  filament of protoplasm, which is in active movement, and by means of\r\n  which the cell swims actively through the water (Fig. 5, _I_ i).\r\n  Sometimes such a cell will be seen to divide into two, the process\r\n  taking but a short time, so that the numbers of these cells under\r\n  favorable conditions may become very large. After a time the lash is\r\n  withdrawn, and the cell assumes much the form of a small amœba (_I_\r\n  ii).\r\n\r\nThe succeeding stages are difficult to follow. After repeatedly\r\ndividing, a large number of these amœba-like cells run together,\r\ncoalescing when they come in contact, and forming a mass of protoplasm\r\nthat grows, and finally assumes the form from which it started.\r\n\r\n  Of the common forms of slime moulds the species of _Trichia_ (Figs.\r\n  _D_, _I_) and _Physarum_ are, perhaps, the best for studying the\r\n  germination, as the spores are larger than in most other forms, and\r\n  germinate more readily. The experiment is apt to be most successful\r\n  if the spores are sown in a drop of water in which has been infused\r\n  some vegetable matter, such as a bit of rotten wood, boiling\r\n  thoroughly to kill all germs. A drop of this fluid should be placed\r\n  on a perfectly clean cover glass, which it is well to pass once or\r\n  twice through a flame, and the spores transferred to this drop with\r\n  a needle previously heated. By these precautions foreign germs will\r\n  be avoided, which otherwise may interfere seriously with the growth\r\n  of the young slime moulds. After sowing the spores in the drop of\r\n  culture fluid, the whole should be inverted over a so-called \"moist\r\n  chamber.\" This is simply a square of thick blotting paper, in which\r\n  an opening is cut small enough to be entirely covered by the cover\r\n  glass, but large enough so that the drop in the centre of the cover\r\n  glass will not touch the sides of the chamber, but will hang\r\n  suspended clear in it. The blotting paper should be soaked\r\n  thoroughly in pure water (distilled water is preferable), and then\r\n  placed on a slide, covering carefully with the cover glass with the\r\n  suspended drop of fluid containing the spores. The whole should be\r\n  kept under cover so as to prevent loss of water by evaporation. By\r\n  this method the spores may be examined conveniently without\r\n  disturbing them, and the whole may be kept as long as desired, so\r\n  long as the blotting paper is kept wet, so as to prevent the\r\n  suspended drop from drying up.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--_Schizophytes_.\r\n\r\nThe Schizophytes are very small plants, though not infrequently\r\noccurring in masses of considerable size. They are among the commonest\r\nof all plants, and are found everywhere. They multiply almost entirely\r\nby simple transverse division, or splitting of the cells, whence their\r\nname. There are two pretty well-marked orders,--the blue-green slimes\r\n(_Cyanophyceæ_) and the bacteria (_Schizomycetes_). They are\r\ndistinguished, primarily, by the first (with a very few exceptions)\r\ncontaining chlorophyll (leaf-green), which is entirely absent from\r\nnearly all of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe blue-green slimes: These are, with few exceptions, green plants of\r\nsimple structure, but possessing, in addition to the ordinary green\r\npigment (chlorophyll, or leaf-green), another coloring matter, soluble\r\nin water, and usually blue in color, though sometimes yellowish or\r\nred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Blue-green slime (_Oscillaria_). _A_, mass of\r\nfilaments of the natural size. _B_, single filament, × 300. _C_, a\r\npiece of a filament that has become separated. _s_, sheath, × 300.]\r\n\r\nAs a representative of the group, we will select one of the commonest\r\nforms (_Oscillaria_), known sometimes as green slime, from forming a\r\ndark blue-green or blackish slimy coat over the mud at the bottom of\r\nstagnant or sluggish water, in watering troughs, on damp rocks, or\r\neven on moist earth. A search in the places mentioned can hardly fail\r\nto secure plenty of specimens for study. If a bit of the slimy mass is\r\ntransferred to a china dish, or placed with considerable water on a\r\npiece of stiff paper, after a short time the edge of the mass will\r\nshow numerous extremely fine filaments of a dark blue-green color,\r\nradiating in all directions from the mass (Fig. 6, _a_). The filaments\r\nare the individual plants, and possess considerable power of motion,\r\nas is shown by letting the mass remain undisturbed for a day or two,\r\nat the end of which time they will have formed a thin film over the\r\nsurface of the vessel in which they are kept; and the radiating\r\narrangement of the filaments can then be plainly seen.\r\n\r\nIf the mass is allowed to dry on the paper, it often leaves a bright\r\nblue stain, due to the blue pigment in the cells of the filament. This\r\nblue color can also be extracted by pulverizing a quantity of the\r\ndried plants, and pouring water over them, the water soon becoming\r\ntinged with a decided blue. If now the water containing the blue\r\npigment is filtered, and the residue treated with alcohol, the latter\r\nwill extract the chlorophyll, becoming colored of a yellow-green.\r\n\r\n  The microscope shows that the filaments of which the mass is\r\n  composed (Fig. 6, _B_) are single rows of short cylindrical cells of\r\n  uniform diameter, except at the end of the filament, where they\r\n  usually become somewhat smaller, so that the tip is more or less\r\n  distinctly pointed. The protoplasm of the cells has a few small\r\n  granules scattered through it, and is colored uniformly of a pale\r\n  blue-green. No nucleus can be seen.\r\n\r\n  If the filament is broken, there may generally be detected a\r\n  delicate, colorless sheath that surrounds it, and extends beyond the\r\n  end cells (Fig. 6, _c_). The filament increases in length by the\r\n  individual cells undergoing division, this always taking place at\r\n  right angles to the axis of the filament. New filaments are produced\r\n  simply by the older ones breaking into a number of pieces, each of\r\n  which rapidly grows to full size.\r\n\r\nThe name \"oscillaria\" arises from the peculiar oscillating or swinging\r\nmovements that the plant exhibits. The most marked movement is a\r\nswaying from side to side, combined with a rotary motion of the free\r\nends of the filaments, which are often twisted together like the\r\nstrands of a rope. If the filaments are entirely free, they may often\r\nbe observed to move forward with a slow, creeping movement. Just how\r\nthese movements are caused is still a matter of controversy.\r\n\r\nThe lowest of the _Cyanophyceæ_ are strictly single-celled, separating\r\nas soon as formed, but cohering usually in masses or colonies by means\r\nof a thick mucilaginous substance that surrounds them (Fig. 7, _D_).\r\n\r\nThe higher ones are filaments, in which there may be considerable\r\ndifferentiation. These often occur in masses of considerable size,\r\nforming jelly-like lumps, which may be soft or quite firm (Fig. 7,\r\n_A_, _B_). They are sometimes found on damp ground, but more commonly\r\nattached to plants, stones, etc., in water. The masses vary in color\r\nfrom light brown to deep blackish green, and in size from that of a\r\npin head to several centimetres in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Forms of _Cyanophyceæ_. _A_, _Nostoc_. _B_,\r\n_Glœotrichia_, × 1. _C_, individual of _Glœotrichia_. _D_,\r\nChroöcoccus. _E_, _Nostoc_. _F_, Oscillaria. _G_, _H_, _Tolypothrix_.\r\nAll × 300. _y_, heterocyst. _sp._ spore.]\r\n\r\nIn the higher forms special cells called heterocysts are found. They\r\nare colorless, or light yellowish, regularly disposed; but their\r\nfunction is not known. Besides these, certain cells become\r\nthick-walled, and form resting cells (spores) for the propagation of\r\nthe plant (Fig. 7, C. _sp._). In species where the sheath of the\r\nfilament is well marked (Fig. 7, _H_), groups of cells slip out of the\r\nsheath, and develop a new one, thus giving rise to a new plant.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria (_Schizomycetes_), although among the commonest of\r\norganisms, owing to their excessive minuteness, are difficult to\r\nstudy, especially for the beginner. They resemble, in their general\r\nstructure and methods of reproduction, the blue-green slimes, but are,\r\nwith very few exceptions, destitute of chlorophyll, although often\r\npossessing bright pigments,--blue, violet, red, etc. It is one of\r\nthese that sometimes forms blood-red spots in flour paste or bits of\r\nbread that have been kept very moist and warm. They are universally\r\npresent where decomposition is going on, and are themselves the\r\nprincipal agents of decay, which is the result of their feeding upon\r\nthe substance, as, like all plants without chlorophyll, they require\r\norganic matter for food. Most of the species are very tenacious of\r\nlife, and may be completely dried up for a long time without dying,\r\nand on being placed in water will quickly revive. Being so extremely\r\nsmall, they are readily carried about in the air in their dried-up\r\ncondition, and thus fall upon exposed bodies, setting up decomposition\r\nif the conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nA simple experiment to show this may be performed by taking two test\r\ntubes and partly filling them with an infusion of almost any organic\r\nsubstance (dried leaves or hay, or a bit of meat will answer). The\r\nfluid should now be boiled so as to kill any germs that may be in it;\r\nand while hot, one of the vessels should be securely stopped up with a\r\nplug of cotton wool, and the other left open. The cotton prevents\r\naccess of all solid particles, but allows the air to enter. If proper\r\ncare has been taken, the infusion in the closed vessel will remain\r\nunchanged indefinitely; but the other will soon become turbid, and a\r\ndisagreeable odor will be given off. Microscopic examination shows the\r\nfirst to be free from germs of any kind, while the second is swarming\r\nwith various forms of bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Bacteria.]\r\n\r\nThese little organisms have of late years attracted the attention of\r\nvery many scientists, from the fact that to them is due many, if not\r\nall, contagious diseases. The germs of many such diseases have been\r\nisolated, and experiments prove beyond doubt that these are alone the\r\ncauses of the diseases in question.\r\n\r\n  If a drop of water containing bacteria is examined, we find them to\r\n  be excessively small, many of them barely visible with the strongest\r\n  lenses. The larger ones (Fig. 8) recall quite strongly the smaller\r\n  species of oscillaria, and exhibit similar movements. Others are so\r\n  small as to appear as mere lines and dots, even with the strongest\r\n  lenses. Among the common forms are small, nearly globular cells;\r\n  oblong, rod-shaped or thread-shaped filaments, either straight or\r\n  curved, or even spirally twisted. Frequently they show a quick\r\n  movement which is probably in all cases due to cilia, which are,\r\n  however, too small to be seen in most cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--_Euglena_. _A_, individual in the active\r\ncondition. _E_, the red \"eye-spot.\" _c_, flagellum. _n_, nucleus. _B_,\r\nresting stage. _C_, individual dividing, × 300.]\r\n\r\nReproduction is for the most part by simple transverse division, as in\r\noscillaria; but occasionally spores are produced also.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--GREEN MONADS (_Volvocineæ_).\r\n\r\nThis group of the protophytes is unquestionably closely related to\r\ncertain low animals (_Monads_ or _Flagellata_), with which they are\r\nsometimes united. They are characterized by being actively motile, and\r\nare either strictly unicellular, or the cells are united by a\r\ngelatinous envelope into a colony of definite form.\r\n\r\nOf the first group, _Euglena_ (Fig. 9), may be selected as a type.\r\n\r\n  This organism is found frequently among other algæ, and occasionally\r\n  forms a green film on stagnant water. It is sometimes regarded as a\r\n  plant, sometimes as an animal, and is an elongated, somewhat\r\n  worm-like cell without a definite cell wall, so that it can change\r\n  its form to some extent. The protoplasm contains oval masses, which\r\n  are bright green in color; but the forward pointed end of the cell\r\n  is colorless, and has a little depression. At this end there is a\r\n  long vibratile protoplasmic filament (_c_), by means of which the\r\n  cell moves. There is also to be seen near this end a red speck (_e_)\r\n  which is probably sensitive to light. A nucleus can usually be seen\r\n  if the cell is first killed with an iodine solution, which often\r\n  will render the flagellum (_c_) more evident, this being invisible\r\n  while the cell is in motion. The cells multiply by division.\r\n  Previous to this the flagellum is withdrawn, and a firm cell wall is\r\n  formed about the cell (Fig. 9, _B_). The contents then divide into\r\n  two or more parts, which afterwards escape as new individuals.\r\n\r\nOf the forms that are united in colonies[2] one of the best known is\r\n_Volvox_ (Fig. 10). This plant is sometimes found in quiet water,\r\nwhere it floats on or near the surface as a dark green ball, just\r\nlarge enough to be seen with the naked eye. They may be kept for some\r\ntime in aquaria, and will sometimes multiply rapidly, but are very\r\nsusceptible to extremes of temperature, especially of heat.\r\n\r\n[2] The term \"colony\" is, perhaps, inappropriate, as the whole mass of\r\ncells arises from a single one, and may properly be looked upon as an\r\nindividual plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Volvox._ _A_, mature colony, containing\r\nseveral smaller ones (_x_), × 50. _B_, Two cells showing the cilia,\r\n× 300.]\r\n\r\n  The colony (Fig. 10, _A_) is a hollow sphere, the numerous green\r\n  cells of which it is composed forming a single layer on the outside.\r\n  By killing with iodine, and using a strong lens, each cell is seen\r\n  to be somewhat pear-shaped (Fig. _B_), with the pointed end out.\r\n  Attached to this end are two vibratile filaments (cilia or\r\n  _flagella_), and the united movements of these cause the rolling\r\n  motion of the whole colony. Usually a number of young colonies\r\n  (Fig. _x_) are found within the mother colony. These arise by the\r\n  repeated bipartition of a single cell, and escape finally, forming\r\n  independent colonies.\r\n\r\n  Another (sexual) form of reproduction occurs, similar to that found\r\n  in many higher plants; but as it only occurs at certain seasons, it\r\n  is not likely to be met with by the student.\r\n\r\nOther forms related to _Volvox_, and sometimes met with, are\r\n_Gonium_, in which there are sixteen cells, forming a flat square;\r\n_Pandorina_ and _Eudorina_, with sixteen cells, forming an oval or\r\nglobular colony like _Volvox_, but much smaller. In all of these the\r\nstructure of the cells is essentially as in _Volvox_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM II.\r\n\r\nALGÆ.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Algæ (sing. _alga_).\r\n\r\nIn the second sub-kingdom of plants is embraced an enormous assemblage\r\nof plants, differing widely in size and complexity, and yet showing a\r\nsufficiently complete gradation from the lowest to the highest as to\r\nmake it impracticable to make more than one sub-kingdom to include\r\nthem. They are nearly all aquatic forms, although many of them will\r\nsurvive long periods of drying, such forms occurring on moist earth,\r\nrocks, or the trunks of trees, but only growing when there is a\r\nplentiful supply of water.\r\n\r\nAll of them possess chlorophyll, which, however, in many forms, is\r\nhidden by the presence of a brown or red pigment. They are ordinarily\r\ndivided into three classes--I. The Green Algæ (_Chlorophyceæ_);\r\nII. Brown Algæ (_Phæophyceæ_); III. Red Algæ (_Rhodophyceæ_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--GREEN ALGÆ.\r\n\r\nThe green algæ are to be found almost everywhere where there is\r\nmoisture, but are especially abundant in sluggish or stagnant fresh\r\nwater, being much less common in salt water. They are for the most\r\npart plants of simple structure, many being unicellular, and very few\r\nof them plants of large size.\r\n\r\nWe may recognize five well-marked orders of the green algæ--I. Green\r\nslimes (_Protococcaceæ_); II. _Confervaceæ_; III. Pond scums\r\n(_Conjugatæ_); IV. _Siphoneæ_; V. Stone-worts (_Characeæ_).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I.--_Protococcaceæ_.\r\n\r\nThe members of this order are minute unicellular plants, growing\r\neither in water or on the damp surfaces of stones, tree trunks, etc.\r\nThe plants sometimes grow isolated, but usually the cells are united\r\nmore or less regularly into colonies.\r\n\r\nA common representative of the order is the common green slime,\r\n_Protococcus_ (Fig. 11, _A_, _C_), which forms a dark green slimy\r\ncoating over stones, tree trunks, flower pots, etc. Owing to their\r\nminute size the structure can only be made out with the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Protococcaceæ._ _A_, _C_, Protococcus. _A_,\r\nsingle cells. _B_, cells dividing by fission. _C_, successive steps in\r\nthe process of internal cell division.

All, × 300. _G_, small portion of a young colony of the\r\nwater net (_Hydrodictyon_), × 150.]\r\n\r\n  Scraping off a little of the material mentioned into a drop of water\r\n  upon a slide, and carefully separating it with needles, a cover\r\n  glass may be placed over the preparation, and it is ready for\r\n  examination. When magnified, the green film is found to be composed\r\n  of minute globular cells of varying size, which may in places be\r\n  found to be united into groups. With a higher power, each cell\r\n  (Fig. 11, _A_) is seen to have a distinct cell wall, within which is\r\n  colorless protoplasm. Careful examination shows that the chlorophyll\r\n  is confined to several roundish bodies that are not usually in\r\n  immediate contact with the wall of the cell. These green masses are\r\n  called chlorophyll bodies (chloroplasts). Toward the centre of the\r\n  cell, especially if it has first been treated with iodine, the\r\n  nucleus may be found. The size of the cells, as well as the number\r\n  of chloroplasts, varies a good deal.\r\n\r\n  With a little hunting, specimens in various stages of division may\r\n  be found. The division takes place in two ways. In the first\r\n  (Fig. 11, _B_), known as fission, a wall is formed across the cell,\r\n  dividing it into two cells, which may separate immediately or may\r\n  remain united until they have undergone further division. In this\r\n  case the original cell wall remains as part of the wall of the\r\n  daughter cells. Fission is the commonest form of cell multiplication\r\n  throughout the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n  The second form of cell division or internal cell division is shown\r\n  at _C_. Here the protoplasm and nucleus repeatedly divide until a\r\n  number of small cells are formed within the old one. These develop\r\n  cell walls, and escape by the breaking of the old cell wall, which\r\n  is left behind, and takes no part in the process. The cells thus\r\n  formed are sometimes provided with two cilia, and are capable of\r\n  active movement.\r\n\r\n  Internal cell division, as we shall see, is found in most plants,\r\n  but only at special times.\r\n\r\n  Closely resembling _Protococcus_, and answering quite as well for\r\n  study, are numerous aquatic forms, such as _Chlorococcum_ (Fig. 12).\r\n  These are for the most part destitute of a firm cell wall, but are\r\n  imbedded in masses of gelatinous substance like many _Cyanophyceæ_.\r\n  The chloroplasts are smaller and less distinct than in\r\n  _Protococcus_. The cells are here oval rather than round, and often\r\n  show a clear space at one end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Chlorococcum_, a plant related to\r\n_Protococcus_, but the naked cells are surrounded by a colorless\r\ngelatinous envelope. _A_, motionless cells. _B_, a cell that has\r\nescaped from its envelope and is ciliated, × 300.]\r\n\r\n  Owing to the absence of a definite membrane, a distinction between\r\n  fission and internal cell division can scarcely be made here. Often\r\n  the cells escape from the gelatinous envelope, and swim actively by\r\n  means of two cilia at the colorless end (Fig. 12, _B_). In this\r\n  stage they closely resemble the individuals of a _Volvox_ colony, or\r\n  other green _Flagellata_, to which there is little doubt that they\r\n  are related.\r\n\r\n  There are a number of curious forms common in fresh water that are\r\n  probably related to _Protococcus_, but differ in having the cells\r\n  united in colonies of definite form. Among the most striking are\r\n  the different species of _Pediastrum_ (Fig. 11, _D_, _E_), often met\r\n  with in company with other algæ, and growing readily in aquaria when\r\n  once established. They are of very elegant shapes, and the number of\r\n  cells some multiple of four, usually sixteen.\r\n\r\n  The cells form a flat disc, the outer ones being generally provided\r\n  with a pair of spines.\r\n\r\n  New individuals arise by internal division of the cells, the\r\n  contents of each forming as many parts as there are cells in the\r\n  whole colony. The young cells now escape through a cleft in the wall\r\n  of the mother cell, but are still surrounded by a delicate membrane\r\n  (Fig. 11, _E_). Within this membrane the young cells arrange\r\n  themselves in the form of the original colony, and grow together,\r\n  forming a new colony.\r\n\r\n  A much larger but rarer form is the water net (Fig. 11, _G_), in\r\n  which the colony has the form of a hollow net, the spaces being\r\n  surrounded by long cylindrical cells placed end to end. Other common\r\n  forms belong to the genus _Scenedesmus_ (Fig. 11, _F_), of which\r\n  there are many species.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II.--_Confervaceæ_.\r\n\r\nUnder this head are included a number of forms of which the simplest\r\nones approach closely, especially in their younger stages, the\r\n_Protococcaceæ_. Indeed, some of the so-called _Protococcaceæ_ are\r\nknown to be only the early stages of these plants.\r\n\r\nA common member of this order is _Cladophora_, a coarse-branching\r\nalga, growing commonly in running water, where it forms tufts,\r\nsometimes a metre or more in length. By floating out a little of it in\r\na saucer, it is easy to see that it is made up of branching filaments.\r\n\r\n  The microscope shows (Fig. 13, _A_) that these filaments are rows of\r\n  cylindrical cells with thick walls showing evident stratification.\r\n  At intervals branches are given off, which may in turn branch,\r\n  giving rise to a complicated branching system. These branches begin\r\n  as little protuberances of the cell wall at the top of the cell.\r\n  They increase rapidly in length, and becoming slightly contracted at\r\n  the base, a wall is formed across at this point, shutting it off\r\n  from the mother cell.\r\n\r\n  The protoplasm lines the wall of the cell, and extends in the form\r\n  of thin plates across the cavity of the cell, dividing it up into a\r\n  number of irregular chambers. Imbedded in the protoplasm are\r\n  numerous flattened chloroplasts, which are so close together as to\r\n  make the protoplasm appear almost uniformly green. Within the\r\n  chloroplasts are globular, glistening bodies, called \"pyrenoids.\"\r\n  The cell has several nuclei, but they are scarcely evident in the\r\n  living cell. By placing the cells for a few hours in a one per cent\r\n  watery solution of chromic acid, then washing thoroughly and\r\n  staining with borax carmine, the nuclei will be made very evident\r\n  (Fig. 13, _B_). Such preparations may be kept permanently in dilute\r\n  glycerine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--_Cladophora._ _A_, a fragment of a plant,\r\n× 50. _B_, a single cell treated with chromic acid, and stained with\r\nalum cochineal. _n_, nucleus. _py._ pyrenoid, × 150. _C_, three stages\r\nin the division of a cell. i, 1.45 p.m.; ii, 2.55 p.m.; iii,\r\n4.15 p.m., × 150. _D_, a zoöspore × 350.]\r\n\r\n  If a mass of actively growing filaments is examined, some of the\r\n  cells will probably be found in process of fission. The process is\r\n  very simple, and may be easily followed (Fig. 13, _C_). A ridge of\r\n  cellulose is formed around the cell wall, projecting inward, and\r\n  pushing in the protoplasm as it grows. The process is continued\r\n  until the ring closes in the middle, cutting the protoplasmic body\r\n  completely in two, and forms a firm membrane across the middle of\r\n  the cell. The protoplasm at this stage (_C_ iii.) is somewhat\r\n  contracted, but soon becomes closely applied to the new wall. The\r\n  whole process lasts, at ordinary temperatures (20°-25° C.), from\r\n  three to four hours.\r\n\r\n  At certain times, but unfortunately not often to be met with, the\r\n  contents of some of the cells form, by internal division, a large\r\n  number of small, naked cells (zoöspores) (Fig. 13, _D_), which\r\n  escape and swim about actively for a time, and afterwards become\r\n  invested with a cell wall, and grow into a new filament. These cells\r\n  are called zoöspores, from their animal-like movements. They are\r\n  provided with two cilia, closely resembling the motile cells of the\r\n  _Protococcaceæ_ and _Volvocineæ_.\r\n\r\nThere are very many examples of these simple _Confervaceæ_, some like\r\n_Conferva_ being simple rows of cells, others like _Stigeoclonium_\r\n(Fig. 14, _A_), _Chætophora_ and _Draparnaldia_ (Fig. 14, _B_, _C_),\r\nvery much branched. The two latter forms are surrounded by masses of\r\ntransparent jelly, which sometimes reach a length of several\r\ncentimetres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--_Confervaceæ_. _A_, _Stigeoclonium_. _B_,\r\n_Draparnaldia_, × 50. _C_, a piece of _Draparnaldia_, × 2. _D_, part\r\nof a filament of _Conferva_, × 300.]\r\n\r\nAmong the marine forms related to these may be mentioned the sea\r\nlettuce (_Ulva_), shown in Figure 15. The thin, bright-green,\r\nleaf-like fronds of this plant are familiar to every seaside student.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--A plant of sea lettuce (_Ulva_). One-half\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nSomewhat higher than _Cladophora_ and its allies, especially in the\r\ndifferentiation of the reproductive parts, are the various species of\r\n_Œdogonium_ and its relatives. There are numerous species of\r\n_Œdogonium_ not uncommon in stagnant water growing in company with\r\nother algæ, but seldom forming masses by themselves of sufficient size\r\nto be recognizable to the naked eye.\r\n\r\n  The plant is in structure much like _Cladophora_, except that it is\r\n  unbranched, and the cells have but a single nucleus (Fig. 16, _E_).\r\n  Even when not fruiting the filaments may usually be recognized by\r\n  peculiar cap-shaped structures at the top of some of the cells.\r\n  These arise as the result of certain peculiarities in the process of\r\n  cell division, which are too complicated to be explained here.\r\n\r\n  There are two forms of reproduction, non-sexual and sexual. In the\r\n  first the contents of certain cells escape in the form of large\r\n  zoöspores (Fig. 16, _C_), of oval form, having the smaller end\r\n  colorless and surrounded by a crown of cilia. After a short period\r\n  of active motion, the zoöspore comes to rest, secretes a cell wall\r\n  about itself, and the transparent end becomes flattened out into a\r\n  disc (_E_, _d_), by which it fastens itself to some object in the\r\n  water. The upper part now rapidly elongates, and dividing repeatedly\r\n  by cross walls, develops into a filament like the original one. In\r\n  many species special zoöspores are formed, smaller than the ordinary\r\n  ones, that attach themselves to the filaments bearing the female\r\n  reproductive organ (oögonium), and grow into small plants bearing\r\n  the male organ (antheridium), (Fig. 16, _B_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--_A_, portion of a filament of _Œdogonium_,\r\nwith two oögonia (_og._). The lower one shows the opening. _B_, a\r\nsimilar filament, to which is attached a small male plant with an\r\nantheridium (_an._). _C_, a zoöspore of _Œdogonium_. _D_, a similar\r\nspore germinating. _E_, base of a filament showing the disc (_d_) by\r\nwhich it is attached. _F_, another species of _Œdogonium_ with a ripe\r\nspore (_sp._). _G_, part of a plant of _Bulbochæte_. _C_, _D_, × 300;\r\nthe others × 150.]\r\n\r\n  The sexual reproduction takes place as follows: Certain cells of a\r\n  filament become distinguished by their denser contents and by an\r\n  increase in size, becoming oval or nearly globular in form (Fig. 16,\r\n  _A_, _B_). When fully grown, the contents contract and form a naked\r\n  cell, which sometimes shows a clear area at one point on the\r\n  surface. This globular mass of protoplasm is the egg cell, or female\r\n  cell, and the cell containing it is called the \"oögonium.\" When the\r\n  egg cell is ripe, the oögonium opens by means of a little pore at\r\n  one side (Fig. 16, _A_).\r\n\r\n  In other cells, either of the same filament or else of the small\r\n  male plants already mentioned, small motile cells, called\r\n  spermatozoids, are formed. These are much smaller than the egg cell,\r\n  and resemble the zoöspores in form, but are much smaller, and\r\n  without chlorophyll. When ripe they are discharged from the cells in\r\n  which they were formed, and enter the oögonium. By careful\r\n  observation the student may possibly be able to follow the\r\n  spermatozoid into the oögonium, where it enters the egg cell at the\r\n  clear spot on its surface. As a result of the entrance of the\r\n  spermatozoid (fertilization), the egg cell becomes surrounded by a\r\n  thick brown wall, and becomes a resting spore. The spore loses its\r\n  green color, and the wall becomes dark colored and differentiated\r\n  into several layers, the outer one often provided with spines\r\n  (Fig. 16, _F_). As these spores do not germinate for a long time,\r\n  the process is only known in a comparatively small number of\r\n  species, and can hardly be followed by the ordinary student.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--_A_, plant of _Coleochæte_, × 50. _B_, a few\r\ncells from the margin, with one of the hairs.]\r\n\r\nMuch like _Œdogonium_, but differing in being branched, is the genus\r\n_Bulbochæte_, characterized also by hairs swollen at the base, and\r\nprolonged into a delicate filament (Fig. 16, _G_).\r\n\r\nThe highest members of the _Confervaceæ_ are those of the genus\r\n_Coleochæte_ (Fig. 17), of which there are several species found in\r\nthe United States. These show some striking resemblances to the red\r\nseaweeds, and possibly form a transition from the green algæ to the\r\nred. The commonest species form bright-green discs, adhering firmly\r\nto the stems and floating leaves of water lilies and other aquatics.\r\nIn aquaria they sometimes attach themselves in large numbers to the\r\nglass sides of the vessel.\r\n\r\n  Growing from the upper surface are numerous hairs, consisting of a\r\n  short, sheath-like base, including a very long and delicate filament\r\n  (Fig. 17, _B_). In their methods of reproduction they resemble\r\n  _Œdogonium_, but the reproductive organs are more specialized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGREEN ALGÆ--_Continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III.--POND SCUMS (_Conjugatæ_).\r\n\r\nThe _Conjugatæ_, while in some respects approaching the _Confervaceæ_\r\nin structure, yet differ from them to such an extent in some respects\r\nthat their close relationship is doubtful. They are very common and\r\nfamiliar plants, some of them forming great floating masses upon the\r\nsurface of every stagnant pond and ditch, being commonly known as\r\n\"pond scum.\" The commonest of these pond scums belong to the genus\r\n_Spirogyra_, and one of these will illustrate the characteristics of\r\nthe order. When in active growth these masses are of a vivid green,\r\nand owing to the presence of a gelatinous coating feel slimy, slipping\r\nthrough the hands when one attempts to lift them from the water.\r\nSpread out in water, the masses are seen to be composed of slender\r\nthreads, often many centimetres in length, and showing no sign of\r\nbranching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--_A_, a filament of a common pond scum\r\n(_Spirogyra_) separating into two parts. _B_, a cell undergoing\r\ndivision.

All\r\n× 150.]\r\n\r\n  For microscopical examination the larger species are preferable.\r\n  When one of these is magnified (Fig. 18, _A_, _C_), the unbranched\r\n  filament is shown to be made up of perfectly cylindrical cells, with\r\n  rather delicate walls. The protoplasm is confined to a thin layer\r\n  lining the walls, except for numerous fine filaments that radiate\r\n  from the centrally placed nucleus (_n_), which thus appears\r\n  suspended in the middle of the cell. The nucleus is large and\r\n  distinct in the larger species, and has a noticeably large and\r\n  conspicuous nucleolus. The most noticeable thing about the cell is\r\n  the green spiral bands running around it. These are the\r\n  chloroplasts, which in all the _Conjugatæ_ are of very peculiar\r\n  forms. The number of these bands varies much in different species of\r\n  _Spirogyra_, but is commonly two or three. These chloroplasts, like\r\n  those of other plants, are not noticeably different in structure\r\n  from the ordinary protoplasm, as is shown by extracting the\r\n  chlorophyll, which may be done by placing the plants in alcohol for\r\n  a short time. This extracts the chlorophyll, but a microscopic\r\n  examination of the decolored cells shows that the bands remain\r\n  unchanged, except for the absence of color. These bands are\r\n  flattened, with irregularly scalloped margins, and at intervals have\r\n  rounded bodies (pyrenoids) imbedded in them (Fig. 18, _C_, _py._).\r\n  The pyrenoids, especially when the plant has been exposed to the\r\n  light for some time, are surrounded by a circle of small granules,\r\n  which become bluish when iodine is applied, showing them to be\r\n  starch. (To show the effect of iodine on starch on a large scale,\r\n  mix a little flour, which is nearly all starch, with water, and add\r\n  a little iodine. The starch will immediately become colored blue,\r\n  varying in intensity with the amount of iodine.) The cells divide\r\n  much as in _Cladophora_, but the nucleus here takes part in the\r\n  process. The division naturally occurs only at night, but by\r\n  reducing the temperature at night to near the freezing point (4° C.,\r\n  or a little lower), the process may be checked. The experiment is\r\n  most conveniently made when the temperature out of doors approaches\r\n  the freezing point. Then it is only necessary to keep the plants in\r\n  a warm room until about 10 P.M., when they may be put out of doors\r\n  for the night. On bringing them in in the morning, the division will\r\n  begin almost at once, and may be easily studied. The nucleus divides\r\n  into two parts, which remain for a time connected by delicate\r\n  threads (Fig. 18, _B_), that finally disappear. At first no nucleoli\r\n  are present in the daughter nuclei, but they appear before the\r\n  division is complete.\r\n\r\n  New filaments are formed by the breaking up of the old ones, this\r\n  sometimes being very rapid. As the cells break apart, the free ends\r\n  bulge strongly, showing the pressure exerted upon the cell wall by\r\n  the contents (Fig. 18, _A_).\r\n\r\nSpores like those of _Œdogonium_ are formed, but the process is\r\nsomewhat different. It occurs in most species late in the spring, but\r\nmay sometimes be met with at other times. The masses of fruiting\r\nplants usually appear brownish colored. If spores have been formed\r\nthey can, in the larger species at least, be seen with a hand lens,\r\nappearing as rows of dark-colored specks.\r\n\r\n  Two filaments lying side by side send out protuberances of the cell\r\n  wall that grow toward each other until they touch (Fig. 18, _D_). At\r\n  the point of contact, the wall is absorbed, forming a continuous\r\n  channel from one cell to the other. This process usually takes place\r\n  in all the cells of the two filaments, so that the two filaments,\r\n  connected by tubes at regular intervals, have the form of a ladder.\r\n\r\n  In some species adjoining cells of the same filament become\r\n  connected, the tubes being formed at the end of the cells (Fig. 18,\r\n  _H_), and the cell in which the spore is formed enlarges.\r\n\r\n  Soon after the channel is completed, the contents of one cell flow\r\n  slowly through it into the neighboring cell, and the protoplasm of\r\n  the two fuses into one mass. (The union of the nuclei has also been\r\n  observed.) The young spore thus formed contracts somewhat, becoming\r\n  oval in form, and soon secretes a thick wall, colorless at first,\r\n  but afterwards becoming brown and more or less opaque. The\r\n  chlorophyll bands, although much crowded, are at first\r\n  distinguishable, but later lose the chlorophyll, and become\r\n  unrecognizable. Like the resting spores of _Œdogonium_ these require\r\n  a long period of rest before germinating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Forms of _Zygnemaceæ_. _A_, _Zygnema_. _B_,\r\n_C_, _D_, _Mesocarpus_. All × 150.]\r\n\r\nThere are various genera of the pond scums, differing in the form of\r\nthe chloroplasts and also in the position of the spores. Of these may\r\nbe mentioned _Zygnema_ (Fig. 19, _A_), with two star-shaped\r\nchloroplasts in each cell, and _Mesocarpus_ (Fig. 19, _B_, _D_), in\r\nwhich the single chloroplast has the form of a thin median plate. (B\r\nshows the appearance from in front, _C_ from the side, showing the\r\nthickness of the plate.) _Mesocarpus_ and the allied genera have the\r\nspore formed between the filaments, the contents of both the uniting\r\ncells leaving them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Forms of Desmids. _A_, _B_, _Closterium_.\r\n_C_, _D_, _Dʹ_, _Cosmarium_. _D_, and _Dʹ_ show the process of\r\ndivision. _E_, _F_, _Staurastrum_; _E_ seen from the side, _F_ from\r\nthe end.]\r\n\r\nEvidently related to the pond scums, but differing in being for the\r\nmost part strictly unicellular, are the desmids (Fig. 20). They are\r\nconfined to fresh water, and seldom occur in masses of sufficient size\r\nto be seen with the naked eye, usually being found associated with\r\npond scums or other filamentous forms. Many of the most beautiful\r\nforms may be obtained by examining the matter adhering to the leaves\r\nand stems of many floating water plants, especially the bladder weed\r\n(_Utricularia_) and other fine-leaved aquatics.\r\n\r\n  The desmids include the most beautiful examples of unicellular\r\n  plants to be met with, the cells having extremely elegant outlines.\r\n  The cell shows a division into two parts, and is often constricted\r\n  in the middle, each division having a single large chloroplast of\r\n  peculiar form. The central part of the cell in which the nucleus\r\n  lies is colorless.\r\n\r\n  Among the commonest forms, often growing with _Spirogyra_, are\r\n  various species of _Closterium_ (Fig. 20, _A_, _B_), recognizable at\r\n  once by their crescent shape. The cell appears bright green, except\r\n  at the ends and in the middle. The large chloroplast in each half is\r\n  composed of six longitudinal plates, united at the axis of the cell.\r\n  Several large pyrenoids are always found, often forming a regular\r\n  line through the central axis. At each end of the cell is a vacuole\r\n  containing small granules that show an active dancing movement.\r\n\r\nThe desmids often have the power of movement, swimming or creeping\r\nslowly over the slide as we examine them, but the mechanism of these\r\nmovements is still doubtful.\r\n\r\nIn their reproduction they closely resemble the pond scums.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER IV.--_Siphoneæ_.\r\n\r\nThe _Siphoneæ_ are algæ occurring both in fresh and salt water, and\r\nare distinguished from other algæ by having the form of a tube,\r\nundivided by partition walls, except when reproduction occurs. The\r\nonly common representatives of the order in fresh water are those\r\nbelonging to the genus _Vaucheria_, but these are to be had almost\r\neverywhere. They usually occur in shallow ditches and ponds, growing\r\non the bottom, or not infrequently becoming free, and floating where\r\nthe water is deeper. They form large, dark green, felted masses, and\r\nare sometimes known as \"green felts.\" Some species grow also on the\r\nwet ground about springs. An examination of one of the masses shows it\r\nto be made up of closely matted, hair-like threads, each of which is\r\nan individual plant.\r\n\r\n  In transferring the plants to the slide for microscopic examination,\r\n  they must be handled very carefully, as they are very easily\r\n  injured. Each thread is a long tube, branching sometimes, but not\r\n  divided into cells as in _Spirogyra_ or _Cladophora_. If we follow\r\n  it to the tip, the contents here will be found to be denser, this\r\n  being the growing point. By careful focusing it is easy to show that\r\n  the protoplasm is confined to a thin layer lining the wall, the\r\n  central cavity of the tube being filled with cell sap. In the\r\n  protoplasm are numerous elongated chloroplasts (_cl._). and a larger\r\n  or smaller number of small, shining, globular bodies (_ol._). These\r\n  latter are drops of oil, and, when the filaments are injured,\r\n  sometimes run together, and form drops of large size. No nucleus can\r\n  be seen in the living plant, but by treatment with chromic acid and\r\n  staining, numerous very small nuclei may be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--_A_, _C_, successive stages in the\r\ndevelopment of the sexual organs of a green felt (_Vaucheria_). _an._\r\nantheridium. _og._ oögonium. _D_, a ripe oögonium. _E_, the same after\r\nit has opened. _o_, the egg cell. _F_, a ripe spore. _G_, a species in\r\nwhich the sexual organs are borne separately on the main filament.\r\n_A_, _F_, × 150. _G_, × 50. _cl._ chloroplasts. _ol._ oil.]\r\n\r\n  When the filaments are growing upon the ground, or at the bottom of\r\n  shallow water, the lower end is colorless, and forms a more or less\r\n  branching root-like structure, fastening it to the earth. These\r\n  rootlets, like the rest of the filament, are undivided by walls.\r\n\r\n  One of the commonest and at the same time most characteristic\r\n  species is _Vaucheria racemosa_ (Fig. 21, _A_, _F_). The plant\r\n  multiplies non-sexually by branches pinched off by a constriction at\r\n  the point where they join the main filament, or by the filament\r\n  itself becoming constricted and separating into several parts, each\r\n  one constituting a new individual.\r\n\r\n  The sexual organs are formed on special branches, and their\r\n  arrangement is such as to make the species instantly recognizable.\r\n\r\n  The first sign of their development is the formation of a short\r\n  branch (Fig. 21, _A_) growing out at right angles to the main\r\n  filament. This branch becomes club-shaped, and the end somewhat\r\n  pointed and more slender, and curves over. This slender, curved\r\n  portion is almost colorless, and is soon shut off from the rest of\r\n  the branch. It is called an \"antheridium,\" and within are produced,\r\n  by internal division, numerous excessively small spermatozoids.\r\n\r\n  As the branch grows, its contents become very dense, the oil drops\r\n  especially increasing in number and size. About the time that the\r\n  antheridium becomes shut off, a circle of buds appears about its\r\n  base (Fig. 21, _B_, _og._). These are the young oögonia, which\r\n  rapidly increase in size, assuming an oval form, and become\r\n  separated by walls from the main branch (_C_). Unlike the\r\n  antheridium, the oögonia contain a great deal of chlorophyll,\r\n  appearing deep green.\r\n\r\n  When ripe, the antheridium opens at the end and discharges the\r\n  spermatozoids, which are, however, so very small as scarcely to be\r\n  visible except with the strongest lenses. They are little oval\r\n  bodies with two cilia, which may sometimes be rendered visible by\r\n  staining with iodine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--_A_, non-sexual reproduction in _Vaucheria\r\nsessilis_. _B_, non-sexual spore of _V. geminata_, × 50.]\r\n\r\n  The oögonia, which at first are uniformly colored, just before\r\n  maturity show a colorless space at the top, from which the\r\n  chloroplasts and oil drops have disappeared (_D_), and at the same\r\n  time this portion pushes out in the form of a short beak. Soon after\r\n  the wall is absorbed at this point, and a portion of the contents is\r\n  forced out, leaving an opening, and at the same time the remaining\r\n  contents contract to form a round mass, the germ or egg cell\r\n  (Fig. 21, _E_, _o_). Almost as soon as the oögonium opens, the\r\n  spermatozoids collect about it and enter; but, on account of their\r\n  minuteness, it is almost impossible to follow them into the egg\r\n  cell, or to determine whether several or only one enter. The\r\n  fertilized egg cell becomes almost at once surrounded by a wall,\r\n  which rapidly thickens, and forms a resting spore. As the spore\r\n  ripens, it loses its green color, becoming colorless, with a few\r\n  reddish brown specks scattered through it (_F_).\r\n\r\n  In some species the sexual organs are borne directly on the filament\r\n  (Fig. 21, _G_).\r\n\r\n  Large zoöspores are formed in some of the green felts (Fig. 22,\r\n  _A_), and are produced singly in the ends of branches that become\r\n  swollen, dark green, and filled with very dense protoplasm. This end\r\n  becomes separated by a wall from the rest of the branch, the end\r\n  opens, and the contents escape as a very large zoöspore, covered\r\n  with numerous short cilia (_A_ ii). After a short period of\r\n  activity, this loses its cilia, develops a wall, and begins to grow\r\n  (III, IV). Other species (_B_) produce similar spores, which,\r\n  however, are not motile, and remain within the mother cell until\r\n  they are set free by the decay of its wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER V.--_Characeæ_.\r\n\r\nThe _Characeæ_, or stone-worts, as some of them are called, are so\r\nvery different from the other green algæ that it is highly probable\r\nthat they should be separated from them.\r\n\r\nThe type of the order is the genus _Chara_ (Fig. 23), called\r\nstone-worts from the coating of carbonate of lime found in most of\r\nthem, giving them a harsh, stony texture. Several species are common\r\ngrowing upon the bottom of ponds and slow streams, and range in size\r\nfrom a few centimetres to a metre or more in height.\r\n\r\nThe plant (Fig. 23, _A_) consists of a central jointed axis with\r\ncircles of leaves at each joint or node. The distance between the\r\nnodes (internodes) may in the larger species reach a length of several\r\ncentimetres. The leaves are slender, cylindrical structures, and like\r\nthe stem divided into nodes and internodes, and have at the nodes\r\ndelicate leaflets.\r\n\r\nAt each joint of the leaf, in fruiting specimens, attached to the\r\ninner side, are borne two small, roundish bodies, in the commoner\r\nspecies of a reddish color (Fig. 23, _A_, _r_). The lower of the two\r\nis globular, and bright scarlet in color; the other, more oval and\r\nduller.\r\n\r\nExamined with a lens the main axis presents a striated appearance. The\r\nwhole plant is harsh to the touch and brittle, owing to the limy\r\ncoating. It is fastened to the ground by fine, colorless hairs, or\r\nrootlets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--_A_, plant of a stone-wort (_Chara_),\r\none-half natural size. _r_, reproductive organs. _B_, longitudinal\r\nsection through the apex. _S_, apical cell. _x_, nodes. _y_,\r\ninternodes. _C_, a young leaf. _D_, cross section of an internode.\r\n_E_, of a node of a somewhat older leaf. _F_, _G_, young sexual organs\r\nseen in optical section. _o_, oögonium. _An._ antheridium. _H_,\r\nsuperficial view. _G_, _I_, group of filaments containing\r\nspermatozoids. _J_, a small portion of one of these more magnified,\r\nshowing a spermatozoid in each cell. _K_, free spermatozoids. _L_, a\r\npiece of a leaf with ripe oögonium (_o_), and antheridium (_An._).\r\n_B_, _H_, × 150. _J_, _K_, × 300. _I_, × 50. _L_, × 25.]\r\n\r\n  By making a series of longitudinal sections with a sharp razor\r\n  through the top of the plant, and magnifying sufficiently, it is\r\n  found to end in a single, nearly hemispherical cell (Fig. 23, _B_,\r\n  _S_). This from its position is called the \"apical cell,\" and from\r\n  it are derived all the tissues of the plant. Segments are cut off\r\n  from its base, and these divide again into two by a wall parallel to\r\n  the first. Of the two cells thus formed one undergoes no further\r\n  division and forms the central cell of an internode (_y_); the other\r\n  divides repeatedly, forming a node or joint (_x_).\r\n\r\n  As the arrangement of these cells is essentially the same in the\r\n  leaves and stem, we will examine it in the former, as by cutting\r\n  several cross-sections of the whole bunch of young leaves near the\r\n  top of the plant, we shall pretty certainly get some sections\r\n  through a joint. The arrangement is shown in Figure 23, _E_.\r\n\r\n  As the stem grows, a covering is formed over the large internodal\r\n  cell (_y_) by the growth of cells from the nodes. These grow both\r\n  from above and below, meeting in the middle of the internode and\r\n  completely hiding the long axial cell. A section across the\r\n  internode shows the large axial cell (_y_) surrounded by the\r\n  regularly arranged cells of the covering or cortex (Fig. 23, _D_).\r\n\r\n  All the cells contain a layer of protoplasm next the wall with\r\n  numerous oval chloroplasts. If the cells are uninjured, they often\r\n  show a very marked movement of the protoplasm. These movements are\r\n  best seen, however, in forms like _Nitella_, where the long\r\n  internodal cells are not covered with a cortex. In _Chara_ they are\r\n  most evident in the root hairs that fasten the plant to the ground.\r\n\r\n  The growth of the leaves is almost identical with that of the stem,\r\n  but the apical growth is limited, and the apical cell becomes\r\n  finally very long and pointed (Fig. 23, _C_). In some species the\r\n  chloroplasts are reddish in the young cells, assuming their green\r\n  color as the cells approach maturity.\r\n\r\nThe plant multiplies non-sexually by means of special branches that\r\nmay become detached, but there are no non-sexual spores formed.\r\n\r\n  The sexual organs have already been noticed arising in pairs at the\r\n  joints of the leaves. The oögonium is formed above, the antheridium\r\n  below.\r\n\r\n  The young oögonium (_F_, _O_) consists of a central cell, below\r\n  which is a smaller one surrounded by a circle of five others, which\r\n  do not at first project above the central cell, but later completely\r\n  envelop it (_G_). Each of these five cells early becomes divided\r\n  into an upper and a lower one, the latter becoming twisted as it\r\n  elongates, and the central cell later has a small cell cut off from\r\n  its base by an oblique wall. The central cell forms the egg cell,\r\n  which in the ripe oögonium (_L_, _O_) is surrounded by five,\r\n  spirally twisted cells, and crowned by a circle of five smaller\r\n  ones, which become of a yellowish color when full grown. They\r\n  separate at the time of fertilization to allow the spermatozoids to\r\n  enter the oögonium.\r\n\r\n  The antheridium consists at first of a basal cell and a terminal\r\n  one. The latter, which is nearly globular, divides into eight nearly\r\n  similar cells by walls passing through the centre. In each of these\r\n  eight cells two walls are next formed parallel to the outer surface,\r\n  so that the antheridium (apart from the basal cell) contains\r\n  twenty-four cells arranged in three concentric series (_G_, _an._).\r\n  These cells, especially the outer ones, develop a great amount of a\r\n  red pigment, giving the antheridium its characteristic color.\r\n\r\n  The diameter of the antheridium now increases rapidly, and the\r\n  central cells separate, leaving a large space within. Of the inner\r\n  cells, the second series, while not increasing in diameter,\r\n  elongate, assuming an oblong form, and from the innermost are\r\n  developed long filaments (_I_, _J_) composed of a single row of\r\n  cells, in each of which is formed a spermatozoid.\r\n\r\n  The eight outer cells are nearly triangular in outline, fitting\r\n  together by deeply indented margins, and having the oblong cells\r\n  with the attached filaments upon their inner faces.\r\n\r\n  If a ripe antheridium is crushed in a drop of water, after lying a\r\n  few minutes the spermatozoids will escape through small openings in\r\n  the side of the cells. They are much larger than any we have met\r\n  with. Each is a colorless, spiral thread with about three coils, one\r\n  end being somewhat dilated with a few granules; the other more\r\n  pointed, and bearing two extremely long and delicate cilia (_K_). To\r\n  see the cilia it is necessary to kill the spermatozoids with iodine\r\n  or some other reagent.\r\n\r\n  After fertilization the outer cells of the oögonium become very\r\n  hard, and the whole falls off, germinating after a sufficient period\r\n  of rest.\r\n\r\nAccording to the accounts of Pringsheim and others, the young plant\r\nconsists at first of a row of elongated cells, upon which a bud is\r\nformed that develops into the perfect plant.\r\n\r\nThere are two families of the _Characeæ_, the _Chareæ_, of which\r\n_Chara_ is the type, and the _Nitelleæ_, represented by various\r\nspecies of _Nitella_ and _Tolypella_. The second family have the\r\ninternodes without any cortex--that is, consisting of a single long\r\ncell; and the crown at the top of the oögonium is composed of ten\r\ncells instead of five. They are also destitute of the limy coating of\r\nthe _Chareæ_.\r\n\r\nBoth as regards the structure of the plant itself, as well as the\r\nreproductive organs, especially the very complex antheridium, the\r\n_Characeæ_ are very widely separated from any other group of plants,\r\neither above or below them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BROWN ALGÆ (_Phæophyceæ_).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Forms of diatoms. _A_, _Pinnularia_. i, seen\r\nfrom above; ii, from the side. _B_, _Fragillaria_ (?). _C_,\r\n_Navicula_. _D_, _F_, _Eunotia_. _E_, _Gomphonema_. _G_, _Cocconeis_.\r\n_H_, _Diatoma_. All × 300.]\r\n\r\nThese plants are all characterized by the presence of a brown pigment,\r\nin addition to the chlorophyll, which almost entirely conceals the\r\nlatter, giving the plants a brownish color, ranging from a light\r\nyellowish brown to nearly black. One order of plants that possibly\r\nbelongs here (_Diatomaceæ_) are single celled, but the others are for\r\nthe most part large seaweeds. The diatoms, which are placed in this\r\nclass simply on account of the color, are probably not closely related\r\nto the other brown algæ, but just where they should be placed is\r\ndifficult to say. In some respects they approach quite closely the\r\ndesmids, and are not infrequently regarded as related to them. They\r\nare among the commonest of organisms occurring everywhere in stagnant\r\nand running water, both fresh and salt, forming usually, slimy,\r\nyellowish coatings on stones, mud, aquatic plants, etc. Like the\r\ndesmids they may be single or united into filaments, and not\r\ninfrequently are attached by means of a delicate gelatinous stalk\r\n(Fig. 25).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Diatoms attached by a gelatinous stalk.\r\n× 150]\r\n\r\n  They are at once distinguished from the desmids by their color,\r\n  which is always some shade of yellowish or reddish brown. The\r\n  commonest forms, _e.g._ _Navicula_ (Fig. 24, _C_), are boat-shaped\r\n  when seen from above, but there is great variety in this respect.\r\n  The cell wall is always impregnated with large amounts of flint, so\r\n  that after the cell dies its shape is perfectly preserved, the flint\r\n  making a perfect cast of it, looking like glass. These flinty shells\r\n  exhibit wonderfully beautiful and delicate markings which are\r\n  sometimes so fine as to test the best lenses to make them out.\r\n\r\n  This shell is composed of two parts, one shutting over the other\r\n  like a pill box and its cover. This arrangement is best seen in such\r\n  large forms as _Pinnularia_ (Fig. 24, _A_ ii).\r\n\r\nMost of the diatoms show movements, swimming slowly or gliding over\r\nsolid substances; but like the movements of _Oscillaria_ and the\r\ndesmids, the movements are not satisfactorily understood, although\r\nseveral explanations have been offered.\r\n\r\nThey resemble somewhat the desmids in their reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE BROWN ALGÆ.\r\n\r\nThese are all marine forms, many of great size, reaching a length in\r\nsome cases of a hundred metres or more, and showing a good deal of\r\ndifferentiation in their tissues and organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--_A_, a branch of common rock weed (_Fucus_),\r\none-half natural size. _x_, end of a branch bearing conceptacles. _B_,\r\nsection through a conceptacle containing oögonia (_og._), × 25. _C_,\r\n_E_, successive stages in the development of the oögonium, × 150. _F_,\r\n_G_, antheridia. In _G_, one of the antheridia has discharged the mass\r\nof spermatozoids (_an._), × 150.]\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest forms is the ordinary rock weed (_Fucus_), which\r\ncovers the rocks of our northeastern coast with a heavy drapery for\r\nseveral feet above low-water mark, so that the plants are completely\r\nexposed as the tide recedes. The commonest species, _F. vesiculosus_\r\n(Fig. 26, _A_), is distinguished by the air sacs with which the stems\r\nare provided. The plant is attached to the rock by means of a sort of\r\ndisc or root from which springs a stem of tough, leathery texture, and\r\nforking regularly at intervals, so that the ultimate branches are very\r\nnumerous, and the plant may reach a length of a metre or more. The\r\nbranches are flattened and leaf-like, the centre traversed by a\r\nthickened midrib. The end of the growing branches is occupied by a\r\ntransversely elongated pit or depression. The growing point is at the\r\nbottom of this pit, and by a regular forking of the growing point the\r\nsymmetrical branching of the plant is brought about. Scattered over\r\nthe surface are little circular pits through whose openings protrude\r\nbunches of fine hairs. When wet the plant is flexible and leathery,\r\nbut it may become quite dry and hard without suffering, as may be seen\r\nwhen the plants are exposed to the sun at low tide.\r\n\r\nThe air bladders are placed in pairs, for the most part, and buoy up\r\nthe plant, bringing it up to the surface when covered with water.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the plant is very soft and gelatinous, while the outer\r\npart forms a sort of tough rind of much firmer consistence. The ends\r\nof some of the branches (Fig. 26, _A_, _x_) are usually much swollen,\r\nand the surface covered with little elevations from which may often be\r\nseen protruding clusters of hairs like those arising from the other\r\nparts of the plant. A section through one of these enlarged ends shows\r\nthat each elevation corresponds to a cavity situated below it. On some\r\nof the plants these cavities are filled with an orange-yellow mass; in\r\nothers there are a number of roundish olive-brown bodies large enough\r\nto be easily seen. The yellow masses are masses of antheridia; the\r\nround bodies, the oögonia.\r\n\r\nIf the plants are gathered while wet, and packed so as to prevent\r\nevaporation of the water, they will keep perfectly for several days,\r\nand may readily be shipped for long distances. If they are to be\r\nstudied away from the seashore, sections for microscopic examination\r\nshould be mounted in salt water (about 3 parts in weight of common\r\nsalt to 100 of water). If fresh material is not to be had, dried\r\nspecimens or alcoholic material will answer pretty well.\r\n\r\n  To study the minute structure of the plant, make a thin\r\n  cross-section, and mount in salt water. The inner part or pith is\r\n  composed of loosely arranged, elongated cells, placed end to end,\r\n  and forming an irregular network, the large spaces between filled\r\n  with the mucilaginous substance derived from the altered outer walls\r\n  of these cells. This mucilage is hard when dry, but swells up\r\n  enormously in water, especially fresh water. The cells grow smaller\r\n  and more compact toward the outside of the section, until there are\r\n  no spaces of any size between those of the outside or rind. The\r\n  cells contain small chloroplasts like those of the higher plants,\r\n  but owing to the presence of the brown pigment found in all of the\r\n  class, in addition to the chlorophyll, they appear golden brown\r\n  instead of green.\r\n\r\n  No non-sexual reproductive bodies are known in the rock weeds,\r\n  beyond small branches that occur in clusters on the margins of the\r\n  main branches, and probably become detached, forming new plants. In\r\n  some of the lower forms, however, _e.g._ _Ectocarpus_ and\r\n  _Laminaria_ (Fig. 28, _A_, _C_), zoöspores are formed.\r\n\r\n  The sexual organs of the rock weed, as we have already seen, are\r\n  borne in special cavities (conceptacles) in the enlarged ends of\r\n  some of the branches. In the species here figured, _F. vesiculosus_,\r\n  the antheridia and oögonia are borne on separate plants; but in\r\n  others, _e.g._ _F. platycarpus_, they are both in the same\r\n  conceptacle.\r\n\r\n  The walls of the conceptacle (Fig. 26, _B_) are composed of closely\r\n  interwoven filaments, from which grow inward numerous hairs, filling\r\n  up the space within, and often extending out through the opening at\r\n  the top.\r\n\r\n  The reproductive bodies arise from the base of these hairs. The\r\n  oögonia (Fig. 26, _C_, _E_) arise as nearly colorless cells, that\r\n  early become divided into two cells, a short basal cell or stalk and\r\n  a larger terminal one, the oögonium proper. The latter enlarges\r\n  rapidly, and its contents divide into eight parts. The division is\r\n  at first indicated by a division of the central portion, which\r\n  includes the nucleus, and is colored brown, into two, four, and\r\n  finally eight parts, after which walls are formed between these. The\r\n  brown color spreads until the whole oögonium is of a nearly uniform\r\n  olive-brown tint.\r\n\r\n  When ripe, the upper part of the oögonium dissolves, allowing the\r\n  eight cells, still enclosed in a delicate membrane, to escape\r\n  (Fig. 27, _H_). Finally, the walls separating the inner cells of the\r\n  oögonium become also absorbed, as well as the surrounding membrane,\r\n  and the eight egg cells escape into the water (Fig. 27, _I_) as\r\n  naked balls of protoplasm, in which a central nucleus may be dimly\r\n  seen.\r\n\r\n  The antheridia (Fig. 26, _F_, _G_) are small oblong cells, at first\r\n  colorless, but when ripe containing numerous glistening, reddish\r\n  brown dots, each of which is part of a spermatozoid. When ripe, the\r\n  contents of the antheridium are forced out into the water (_G_),\r\n  leaving the empty outer wall behind, but still surrounded by a thin\r\n  membrane. After a few minutes this membrane is dissolved, and the\r\n  spermatozoids are set free. These (Fig. 27, _K_) are oval in form,\r\n  with two long cilia attached to the side where the brown speck, seen\r\n  while still within the antheridium, is conspicuous.\r\n\r\n  The act of fertilization may be easily observed by laying fresh\r\n  antheridia into a drop of water containing recently discharged egg\r\n  cells. To obtain these, all that is necessary is to allow freshly\r\n  gathered plants to remain in the air until they are somewhat dry,\r\n  when the ripe sexual cells will be discharged from the openings of\r\n  the conceptacles, exuding as little drops, those with antheridia\r\n  being orange-yellow; the masses of oögonia, olive. Within a few\r\n  minutes after putting the oögonia into water, the egg cells may be\r\n  seen to escape into the water, when some of the antheridia may be\r\n  added. The spermatozoids will be quickly discharged, and collect\r\n  immediately in great numbers about the egg cells, to which they\r\n  apply themselves closely, often setting them in rotation by the\r\n  movements of their cilia, and presenting a most extraordinary\r\n  spectacle (_J_). Owing to the small size of the spermatozoids, and\r\n  the opacity of the eggs, it is impossible to see whether more than\r\n  one spermatozoid penetrates it; but from what is known in other\r\n  cases it is not likely. The egg now secretes a wall about itself,\r\n  and within a short time begins to grow. It becomes pear-shaped, the\r\n  narrow portion becoming attached to the parent plant or to some\r\n  other object by means of rootlets, and the upper part grows into the\r\n  body of the young plant (Fig. 27, _M_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--_H_, the eight egg cells still surrounded by\r\nthe inner membrane of the oögonium. _I_, the egg cells escaping into\r\nthe water. _J_, a single egg cell surrounded by spermatozoids. _K_,\r\nmass of spermatozoids surrounded by the inner membrane of the\r\nantheridium. _L_, spermatozoids. _M_, young plant. _r_, the roots.\r\n_K_, × 300; _L_, × 600; the others, × 150.]\r\n\r\nThe simpler brown seaweeds, so far as known, multiply only by means of\r\nzoöspores, which may grow directly into new plants, or, as has been\r\nobserved in some species, two zoöspores will first unite. A few, like\r\n_Ectocarpus_ (Fig. 28, _A_), are simple, branched filaments, but most\r\nare large plants with complex tissues. Of the latter, a familiar\r\nexample is the common kelp, \"devil's apron\" (_Laminaria_), often three\r\nto four metres in length, with a stout stalk, provided with root-like\r\norgans, by which it is firmly fastened. Above, it expands into a\r\nbroad, leaf-like frond, which in some species is divided into strips.\r\nRelated to the kelps is the giant kelp of the Pacific (_Macrocystis_),\r\nwhich is said sometimes to reach a length of three hundred metres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Forms of brown seaweeds. _A_, _Ectocarpus_,\r\n× 50.

These plants possess distinct stems and\r\nleaves, and there are stalked air bladders, looking like berries,\r\ngiving the plant a striking resemblance to the higher land plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--THE RED ALGÆ (_Rhodophyceæ_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are among the most beautiful and interesting members of the\r\nplant kingdom, both on account of their beautiful colors and the\r\nexquisitely graceful forms exhibited by many of them. Unfortunately\r\nfor inland students they are, with few exceptions, confined to salt\r\nwater, and consequently fresh material is not available. Nevertheless,\r\nenough can be done with dried material to get a good idea of their\r\ngeneral appearance, and the fruiting plants can be readily preserved\r\nin strong alcohol. Specimens, simply dried, may be kept for an\r\nindefinite period, and on being placed in water will assume perfectly\r\nthe appearance of the living plants. Prolonged exposure, however, to\r\nthe action of fresh water extracts the red pigment that gives them\r\ntheir characteristic color. This pigment is found in the chlorophyll\r\nbodies, and usually quite conceals the chlorophyll, which, however,\r\nbecomes evident so soon as the red pigment is removed.\r\n\r\nThe red seaweeds differ much in the complexity of the plant body, but\r\nall agree in the presence of the red pigment, and, at least in the\r\nmain, in their reproduction. The simpler ones consist of rows of\r\ncells, usually branching like _Cladophora_; others form cell plates\r\ncomparable to _Ulva_ (Fig. 30, _C_, _D_); while others, among which is\r\nthe well-known Irish moss (_Chondrus_), form plants of considerable\r\nsize, with pretty well differentiated tissues. In such forms the outer\r\ncells are smaller and firmer, constituting a sort of rind; while the\r\ninner portions are made up of larger and looser cells, and may be\r\ncalled the pith. Between these extremes are all intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nThey usually grow attached to rocks, shells, wood, or other plants,\r\nsuch as the kelps and even the larger red seaweeds. They are most\r\nabundant in the warmer seas, but still a considerable number may be\r\nfound in all parts of the ocean, even extending into the Arctic\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--_A_, a red seaweed (_Callithamnion_), of the\r\nnatural size. _B_, a piece of the same, × 50. _t_, tetraspores. _C_\r\ni-v, successive stages in the development of the tetraspores, × 150.\r\n_D_ I, II young procarps. _tr._ trichogyne. iii, young; iv, ripe spore\r\nfruit.

The spores are here surrounded by a case,\r\n× 50.]\r\n\r\nThe methods of reproduction may be best illustrated by a specific\r\nexample, and preferably one of the simpler ones, as these are most\r\nreadily studied microscopically.\r\n\r\nThe form here illustrated (_Callithamnion_) grows attached to wharves,\r\netc., below low-water mark, and is extremely delicate, collapsing\r\ncompletely when removed from the water. The color is a bright rosy\r\nred, and with its graceful form and extreme delicacy it makes one of\r\nthe most beautiful of the group.\r\n\r\nIf alcoholic material is used, it may be mounted for examination\r\neither in water or very dilute glycerine.\r\n\r\n  The plant is composed of much-branched, slender filaments, closely\r\n  resembling _Cladophora_ in structure, but with smaller cells\r\n  (Fig. 29, _B_). The non-sexual reproduction is by means of special\r\n  spores, which from being formed in groups of four, are known as\r\n  tetraspores. In the species under consideration the mother cell of\r\n  the tetraspores arises as a small bud near the upper end of one of\r\n  the ordinary cells (Fig. 29, _C_ i). This bud rapidly increases in\r\n  size, assuming an oval form, and becoming cut off from the cell of\r\n  the stem (Fig. 29, _C_ ii). The contents now divide into four equal\r\n  parts, arranged like the quadrants of a sphere. When ripe, the wall\r\n  of the mother cell gives way, and the four spores escape into the\r\n  water and give rise to new plants. These spores, it will be noticed,\r\n  differ in one important particular from corresponding spores in most\r\n  algæ, in being unprovided with cilia, and incapable of spontaneous\r\n  movement.\r\n\r\n  Occasionally in the same plant that bears tetraspores, but more\r\n  commonly in special ones, there are produced the sexual organs, and\r\n  subsequently the sporocarps, or fruits, developed from them. The\r\n  plants that bear them are usually stouter that the non-sexual ones,\r\n  and the masses of ripe carpospores are large enough to be readily\r\n  seen with the naked eye.\r\n\r\n  If a plant bearing ripe spores is selected, the young stages of the\r\n  female organ (procarp) may generally be found by examining the\r\n  younger parts of the plant. The procarp arises from a single cell of\r\n  the filament. This cell undergoes division by a series of\r\n  longitudinal walls into a central cell and about four peripheral\r\n  ones (Fig. 29, _D_ i). One of the latter divides next into an upper\r\n  and a lower cell, the former growing out into a long, colorless\r\n  appendage known as a trichogyne (Fig. 29, _D_, _tr._).\r\n\r\n  The antheridia (Fig. 29, _E_) are hemispherical masses of closely\r\n  set colorless cells, each of which develops a single spermatozoid\r\n  which, like the tetraspores, is destitute of cilia, and is dependent\r\n  upon the movement of the water to convey it to the neighborhood of\r\n  the procarp. Occasionally one of these spermatozoids may be found\r\n  attached to the trichogyne, and in this way fertilization is\r\n  effected. Curiously enough, neither the cell which is immediately\r\n  fertilized, nor the one beneath it, undergo any further change; but\r\n  two of the other peripheral cells on opposite sides of the filament\r\n  grow rapidly and develop into large, irregular masses of spores\r\n  (Fig. 29, _D_ III, IV).\r\n\r\nWhile the plant here described may be taken as a type of the group,\r\nit must be borne in mind that many of them differ widely, not only in\r\nthe structure of the plant body, but in the complexity of the sexual\r\norgans and spores as well. The tetraspores are often imbedded in the\r\ntissues of the plant, or may be in special receptacles, nor are they\r\nalways arranged in the same way as here described, and the same is\r\ntrue of the carpospores. These latter are in some of the higher forms,\r\n_e.g._ _Polysiphonia_ (Fig. 29, _F_), contained in urn-shaped\r\nreceptacles, or they may be buried within the tissues of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Marine red seaweeds. _A_, _Dasya_. _B_,\r\n_Rhodymenia_ (with smaller algæ attached). _C_, _Grinnellia_. _D_,\r\n_Delesseria_. _A_, _B_, natural size; the others reduced one-half.]\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water forms are not common, but may occasionally be met with\r\nin mill streams and other running water, attached to stones and\r\nwoodwork, but are much inferior in size and beauty to the marine\r\nspecies. The red color is not so pronounced, and they are, as a rule,\r\nsomewhat dull colored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Fresh-water red algæ. _A_, _Batrachospermum_,\r\n× about 12. _B_, a branch of the same, × 150. _C_, _Lemanea_, natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe commonest genera are _Batrachospermum_ and _Lemanea_ (Fig. 31).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM III.\r\n\r\nFUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name \"Fungi\" has been given to a vast assemblage of plants,\r\nvarying much among themselves, but on the whole of about the same\r\nstructural rank as the algæ. Unlike the algæ, however, they are\r\nentirely destitute of chlorophyll, and in consequence are dependent\r\nupon organic matter for food, some being parasites (growing upon\r\nliving organisms), others saprophytes (feeding on dead matter). Some\r\nof them show close resemblances in structure to certain algæ, and\r\nthere is reason to believe that they are descended from forms that\r\noriginally had chlorophyll; others are very different from any green\r\nplants, though more or less evidently related among themselves.\r\nRecognizing then these distinctions, we may make two divisions of the\r\nsub-kingdom: I. The Alga-Fungi (_Phycomycetes_), and II. The True\r\nFungi (_Mycomycetes_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--_Phycomycetes_.\r\n\r\nThese are fungi consisting of long, undivided, often branching tubular\r\nfilaments, resembling quite closely those of _Vaucheria_ or other\r\n_Siphoneæ_, but always destitute of any trace of chlorophyll. The\r\nsimplest of these include the common moulds (_Mucorini_), one of which\r\nwill serve to illustrate the characteristics of the order.\r\n\r\nIf a bit of fresh bread, slightly moistened, is kept under a bell jar\r\nor tumbler in a warm room, in the course of twenty-four hours or so it\r\nwill be covered with a film of fine white threads, and a little later\r\nwill produce a crop of little globular bodies mounted on upright\r\nstalks. These are at first white, but soon become black, and the\r\nfilaments bearing them also grow dark-colored.\r\n\r\nThese are moulds, and have grown from spores that are in the\r\natmosphere falling on the bread, which offers the proper conditions\r\nfor their growth and multiplication.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest moulds is the one here figured (Fig. 32), and\r\nnamed _Mucor stolonifer_, from the runners, or \"stolons,\" by which it\r\nspreads from one point to another. As it grows it sends out these\r\nrunners along the surface of the bread, or even along the inner\r\nsurface of the glass covering it. They fasten themselves at intervals\r\nto the substratum, and send up from these points clusters of short\r\nfilaments, each one tipped with a spore case, or \"sporangium.\"\r\n\r\n  For microscopical study they are best mounted in dilute glycerine\r\n  (about one-quarter glycerine to three-quarters pure water). After\r\n  carefully spreading out the specimens in this mixture, allow a drop\r\n  of alcohol to fall upon the preparation, and then put on the cover\r\n  glass. The alcohol drives out the air, which otherwise interferes\r\n  badly with the examination.\r\n\r\n  The whole plant consists of a very long, much-branched, but\r\n  undivided tubular filament. Where it is in contact with the\r\n  substratum, root-like outgrowths are formed, not unlike those\r\n  observed in _Vaucheria_. At first the walls are colorless, but later\r\n  become dark smoky brown in color. A layer of colorless granular\r\n  protoplasm lines the wall, becoming more abundant toward the growing\r\n  tips of the branches. The spore cases, \"sporangia,\" arise at the\r\n  ends of upright branches (Fig. 32, _C_), which at first are\r\n  cylindrical (_a_), but later enlarge at the end (_b_), and become\r\n  cut off by a convex wall (_c_). This wall pushes up into the young\r\n  sporangium, forming a structure called the \"columella.\" When fully\r\n  grown, the sporangium is globular, and appears quite opaque, owing\r\n  to the numerous granules in the protoplasm filling the space between\r\n  the columella and its outer wall. This protoplasm now divides into a\r\n  great number of small oval cells (spores), which rapidly darken,\r\n  owing to a thick, black wall formed about each one, and at the same\r\n  time the columella and the stalk of the sporangium become\r\n  dark-colored.\r\n\r\n  When ripe, the wall of the sporangium dissolves, and the spores\r\n  (Fig. 32, _E_) are set free. The columella remains unchanged, and\r\n  some of the spores often remain sticking to it (Fig. 32, _D_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--_A_, common black mould (_Mucor_), × 5. _B_,\r\nthree nearly ripe spore cases, × 25. _C_, development of the spore\r\ncases, i-iv, × 150; v, × 50. _D_, spore case which has discharged its\r\nspores. _E_, spores, × 300. _F_, a form of _Mucor mucedo_, with small\r\naccessory spore cases, × 5. _G_, the spore cases, × 50. _H_, a single\r\nspore case, × 300. _I_, development of the zygospore of a black mould,\r\n× 45 (after De Bary).]\r\n\r\n  Spores formed in a manner strongly recalling those of the pond scums\r\n  are also known, but only occur after the plants have grown for a\r\n  long time, and hence are rarely met with (Fig. 32, _I_).\r\n\r\nAnother common mould (_M. mucedo_), often growing in company with the\r\none described, differs from it mainly in the longer stalk of the\r\nsporangium, which is also smaller, and in not forming runners. This\r\nspecies sometimes bears clusters of very small sporangia attached to\r\nthe middle of the ordinary sporangial filament (Fig. 32, _F_, _H_).\r\nThese small sporangia have no columella.\r\n\r\nOther moulds are sometimes met with, parasitic upon the larger species\r\nof _Mucor_.\r\n\r\nRelated to the black moulds are the insect moulds (_Entomopthoreæ_),\r\nwhich attack and destroy insects. The commonest of these attacks the\r\nhouse flies in autumn, when the flies, thus infested, may often be\r\nfound sticking to window panes, and surrounded by a whitish halo of\r\nthe spores that have been thrown off by the fungus.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II.--WHITE RUSTS AND MILDEWS (_Peronosporeæ_)\r\n\r\nThese are exclusively parasitic fungi, and grow within the tissues of\r\nvarious flowering plants, sometimes entirely destroying them.\r\n\r\nAs a type of this group we will select a very common one (_Cystopus\r\nbliti_), that is always to be found in late summer and autumn growing\r\non pig weed (_Amarantus_). It forms whitish, blister-like blotches\r\nabout the size of a pin head on the leaves and stems, being commonest\r\non the under side of the leaves (Fig. 33, _A_). In the earlier stages\r\nthe leaf does not appear much affected, but later becomes brown and\r\nwithered about the blotches caused by the fungus.\r\n\r\n  If a thin vertical section of the leaf is made through one of these\r\n  blotches, and mounted as described for _Mucor_, the latter is found\r\n  to be composed of a mass of spores that have been produced below the\r\n  epidermis of the leaf, and have pushed it up by their growth. If the\r\n  section is a very thin one, we may be able to make out the structure\r\n  of the fungus, and then find it to be composed of irregular,\r\n  tubular, much-branched filaments, which, however, are not divided by\r\n  cross-walls. These filaments run through the intercellular spaces of\r\n  the leaf, and send into the cells little globular suckers, by means\r\n  of which the fungus feeds.\r\n\r\n  The spores already mentioned are formed at the ends of crowded\r\n  filaments, that push up, and finally rupture the epidermis (Fig. 33,\r\n  _B_). They are formed by the ends of the filaments swelling up and\r\n  becoming constricted, so as to form an oval spore, which is then cut\r\n  off by a wall. The portion of the filament immediately below acts in\r\n  the same way, and the process is repeated until a chain of half a\r\n  dozen or more may be produced, the lowest one being always the last\r\n  formed. When ripe, the spores are separated by a thin neck, and\r\n  become very easily broken off.\r\n\r\n  In order to follow their germination it is only necessary to place a\r\n  few leaves with fresh patches of the fungus under a bell jar or\r\n  tumbler, inverted over a dish full of water, so as to keep the air\r\n  within saturated with moisture, but taking care to keep the leaves\r\n  out of the water. After about twenty-four hours, if some of the\r\n  spores are scraped off and mounted in water, they will germinate in\r\n  the course of an hour or so. The contents divide into about eight\r\n  parts, which escape from the top of the spore, which at this time\r\n  projects as a little papilla. On escaping, each mass of protoplasm\r\n  swims away as a zoöspore, with two extremely delicate cilia. After a\r\n  short time it comes to rest, and, after developing a thin cell wall,\r\n  germinates by sending out one or two filaments (Fig. 33, _C_, _E_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--_A_, leaf of pig-weed (_Amarantus_), with\r\nspots of white rust (_c_), one-half natural size. _B_, non-sexual\r\nspores (conidia). _C_, the same germinating. _D_, zoöspores. _E_,\r\ngerminating zoöspores. _sp._ the spore. _F_, young. _G_, mature sexual\r\norgans.

All × 300.]\r\n\r\n  Under normal conditions the spores probably germinate when the\r\n  leaves are wet, and the filaments enter the plant through the\r\n  breathing pores on the lower surface of the leaves, and spread\r\n  rapidly through the intercellular spaces.\r\n\r\n  Later on, spores of a very different kind are produced. Unlike those\r\n  already studied, they are formed some distance below the epidermis,\r\n  and in order to study them satisfactorily, the fungus must be freed\r\n  from the host plant. In order to do this, small pieces of the leaf\r\n  should be boiled for about a minute in strong caustic potash, and\r\n  then treated with acetic or hydrochloric acid. By this means the\r\n  tissues of the leaf become so soft as to be readily removed, while\r\n  the fungus is but little affected. The preparation should now be\r\n  washed and mounted in dilute glycerine.\r\n\r\n  The spores (oöspores) are much larger than those first formed, and\r\n  possess an outer coat of a dark brown color (Fig. 33, _H_). Each\r\n  spore is contained in a large cell, which arises as a swelling of\r\n  one of the filaments, and becomes shut off by a wall. At first\r\n  (Fig. 33, _F_) its contents are granular, and fill it completely,\r\n  but later contract to form a globular mass of protoplasm (G.\r\n  _o_), the germ cell or egg cell. The whole is an oögonium, and\r\n  differs in no essential respect from that of _Vaucheria_.\r\n\r\n  Frequently a smaller cell (antheridium), arising from a neighboring\r\n  filament, and in close contact with the oögonium, may be detected\r\n  (Fig. 33, _F_, _G_, _an._), and in exceptionally favorable cases a\r\n  tube is to be seen connecting it with the germ cell, and by means of\r\n  which fertilization is effected.\r\n\r\n  After being fertilized, the germ cell secretes a wall, at first thin\r\n  and colorless, but later becoming thick and dark-colored on the\r\n  outside, and showing a division into several layers, the outermost\r\n  of which is dark brown, and covered with irregular reticulate\r\n  markings. These spores do not germinate at once, but remain over\r\n  winter unchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Fragment of a filament of the white rust of\r\nthe shepherd's-purse, showing the suckers (_h_), × 300.]\r\n\r\nIt is by no means impossible that sometimes the germ cell may develop\r\ninto a spore without being fertilized, as is the case in many of the\r\nwater moulds.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the species above described is another one\r\n(_C. candidus_), which attacks shepherd's-purse, radish, and others of\r\nthe mustard family, upon which it forms chalky white blotches, and\r\ndistorts the diseased parts of the plant very greatly.\r\n\r\n  For some reasons this is the best species for study, longitudinal\r\n  sections through the stem showing very beautifully the structure of\r\n  the fungus, and the penetration of the cells of the host[4] by the\r\n  suckers (Fig. 34).\r\n\r\n[4] \"Host,\" the plant or animal upon which a parasite lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Non-sexual spores of the vine mildew\r\n(_Peronospora viticola_), × 150.]\r\n\r\nVery similar to the white rusts in most respects, but differing in the\r\narrangement of the non-sexual spores, are the mildews (_Peronospora_,\r\n_Phytophthora_). These plants form mouldy-looking patches on the\r\nleaves and stems of many plants, and are often very destructive. Among\r\nthem are the vine mildew (_Peronospora viticola_) (Fig. 35), the\r\npotato fungus (_Phytophthora infestans_), and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III.--_Saprolegniaceæ_ (WATER MOULDS).\r\n\r\nThese plants resemble quite closely the white rusts, and are probably\r\nrelated to them. They grow on decaying organic matter in water, or\r\nsometimes on living water animals, fish, crustaceans, etc. They may\r\nusually be had for study by throwing into water taken from a stagnant\r\npond or aquarium, a dead fly or some other insect. After a few days it\r\nwill probably be found covered with a dense growth of fine, white\r\nfilaments, standing out from it in all directions (Fig. 36, _A_).\r\nSomewhat later, if carefully examined with a lens, little round, white\r\nbodies may be seen scattered among the filaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--_A_, an insect that has decayed in water, and\r\nbecome attacked by a water mould (_Saprolegnia_), natural size. _B_, a\r\nripe zoösporangium, × 100. _C_, the same discharging the spores. _D_,\r\nactive. _E_, germinating zoöspores, × 300. _F_, a second sporangium\r\nforming below the empty one. _G_ i-iv, development of the oögonium,\r\n× 100. _H_, ripe oögonium filled with resting spores, × 100.]\r\n\r\n  On carefully removing a bit of the younger growth and examining it\r\n  microscopically, it is found to consist of long filaments much like\r\n  those of _Vaucheria_, but entirely destitute of chlorophyll. In\r\n  places these filaments are filled with densely granular protoplasm,\r\n  which when highly magnified exhibits streaming movements. The\r\n  protoplasm contains a large amount of oil in the form of small,\r\n  shining drops.\r\n\r\n  In the early stages of its growth the plant multiplies by zoöspores,\r\n  produced in great numbers in sporangia at the ends of the branches.\r\n  The protoplasm collects here much as we saw in _V. sessilis_, the\r\n  end of the filament becoming club-shaped and ending in a short\r\n  protuberance (Fig. 36, _B_). This end becomes separated by a wall,\r\n  and the contents divide into numerous small cells that sometimes are\r\n  naked, and sometimes have a delicate membrane about them. The first\r\n  sign of division is the appearance in the protoplasm of delicate\r\n  lines dividing it into numerous polygonal areas which soon become\r\n  more distinct, and are seen to be distinct cells whose outlines\r\n  remain more or less angular on account of the mutual pressure. When\r\n  ripe, the end of the sporangium opens, and the contained cells are\r\n  discharged (Fig. 36, _C_). In case they have no membrane, they swim\r\n  away at once, each being provided with two cilia, and resembling\r\n  almost exactly the zoöspores of the white rust (Fig. 36, _D_, _E_).\r\n  When the cells are surrounded by a membrane they remain for some\r\n  time at rest, but finally the contents escape as a zoöspore, like\r\n  those already described. By killing the zoöspores with a little\r\n  iodine the granular nature of the protoplasm is made more evident,\r\n  and the cilia may be seen. They soon come to rest, and germinate in\r\n  the same way as those of the white rusts and mildews.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the sporangium is emptied, a new one is formed, either by\r\n  the filament growing up through it (Fig. 36, _F_) and the end being\r\n  again cut off, or else by a branch budding out just below the base\r\n  of the empty sporangium, and growing up by the side of it.\r\n\r\n  Besides zoöspores there are also resting spores developed. Oögonia\r\n  like those of _Vaucheria_ or the _Peronosporeæ_ are formed usually\r\n  after the formation of zoöspores has ceased; but in many cases,\r\n  perhaps all, these develop without being fertilized. Antheridia are\r\n  often wanting, and even when they are present, it is very doubtful\r\n  whether fertilization takes place.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] The antheridia, when present, arise as branches just below the\r\noögonium, and become closely applied to it, sometimes sending tubes\r\nthrough its wall, but there has been no satisfactory demonstration of\r\nan actual transfer of the contents of the antheridium to the egg cell.\r\n\r\n  The oögonia (Fig. 36, _G_, _H_) arise at the end of the main\r\n  filaments, or of short side branches, very much as do the sporangia,\r\n  from which they differ at this stage in being of globular form. The\r\n  contents contract to form one or several egg cells, naked at first,\r\n  but later becoming thick-walled resting spores (_H_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE FUNGI (_Mycomycetes_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the plants ordinarily known as _fungi_ are\r\nembraced under this head. While some of the lower forms show\r\naffinities with the _Phycomycetes_, and through them with the algæ,\r\nthe greater number differ very strongly from all green plants both in\r\ntheir habits and in their structure and reproduction. It is a\r\nmuch-disputed point whether sexual reproduction occurs in any of them,\r\nand it is highly probable that in the great majority, at any rate, the\r\nreproduction is purely non-sexual.\r\n\r\nProbably to be reckoned with the _Mycomycetes_, but of doubtful\r\naffinities, are the small unicellular fungi that are the main causes\r\nof alcoholic fermentation; these are the yeast fungi (_Saccharomycetes_).\r\nThey cause the fermentation of beer and wine, as well as the incipient\r\nfermentation in bread, causing it to \"rise\" by the giving off of\r\nbubbles of carbonic acid gas during the process.\r\n\r\nIf a little common yeast is put into water containing starch or sugar,\r\nand kept in a warm place, in a short time bubbles of gas will make\r\ntheir appearance, and after a little longer time alcohol may be\r\ndetected by proper tests; in short, alcoholic fermentation is taking\r\nplace in the solution.\r\n\r\n  If a little of the fermenting liquid is examined microscopically, it\r\n  will be found to contain great numbers of very small, oval cells,\r\n  with thin cell walls and colorless contents. A careful examination\r\n  with a strong lens (magnifying from 500-1000 diameters) shows that\r\n  the protoplasm, in which are granules of varying size, does not fill\r\n  the cell completely, but that there are one or more large vacuoles\r\n  or spaces filled with colorless cell sap. No nucleus is visible in\r\n  the living cell, but it has been shown that a nucleus is present.\r\n\r\n  If growth is active, many of the cells will be seen dividing. The\r\n  process is somewhat different from ordinary fission and is called\r\n  budding (Fig. 37, _B_). A small protuberance appears at the bud or\r\n  at the side of the cell, and enlarges rapidly, assuming the form of\r\n  the mother cell, from which it becomes completely separated by the\r\n  constriction of the base, and may fall off at once, or, as is more\r\n  frequently the case, may remain attached for a time, giving rise\r\n  itself to other buds, so that not infrequently groups of half a\r\n  dozen or more cells are met with (Fig. 37, _B_, _C_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--_A_, single cells of yeast. _B_, _C_, similar\r\ncells, showing the process of budding, × 750.]\r\n\r\nThat the yeast cells are the principal agents of alcoholic\r\nfermentation may be shown in much the same way that bacteria are shown\r\nto cause ordinary decomposition. Liquids from which they are excluded\r\nwill remain unfermented for an indefinite time.\r\n\r\nThere has been much controversy as to the systematic position of the\r\nyeast fungi, which has not yet been satisfactorily settled, the\r\nquestion being whether they are to be regarded as independent plants\r\nor only one stage in the life history of some higher fungi (possibly\r\nthe _Smuts_), which through cultivation have lost the power of\r\ndeveloping further.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--THE SMUTS (_Ustillagineæ_).\r\n\r\nThe smuts are common and often very destructive parasitic fungi,\r\nliving entirely within the tissues of the higher plants. Owing to\r\nthis, as well as to the excessively small spores and difficulty in\r\ngerminating them, the plants are very difficult of study, except in a\r\ngeneral way, and we will content ourselves with a glance at one of the\r\ncommon forms, the corn smut (_Ustillago maydis_). This familiar fungus\r\nattacks Indian corn, forming its spores in enormous quantities in\r\nvarious parts of the diseased plant, but particularly in the flowers\r\n(\"tassel\" and young ear).\r\n\r\n  The filaments, which resemble somewhat those of the white rusts,\r\n  penetrate all parts of the plant, and as the time approaches for the\r\n  formation of the spores, these branch extensively, and at the same\r\n  time become soft and mucilaginous (Fig. 38, _B_). The ends of these\r\n  short branches enlarge rapidly and become shut off by partitions,\r\n  and in each a globular spore (Fig. 38, _C_) is produced. The outer\r\n  wall is very dark-colored and provided with short spines. To study\r\n  the filaments and spore formation, very thin sections should be made\r\n  through the young kernels or other parts in the vicinity, before\r\n  they are noticeably distorted by the growth of the spore-bearing\r\n  filaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--_A_, \"tassel\" of corn attacked by smut\r\n(_Ustillago_). _B_, filaments of the fungus from a thin section of a\r\ndiseased grain, showing the beginning of the formation of the spores,\r\n× 300. _C_, ripe spores, × 300.]\r\n\r\nAs the spores are forming, an abnormal growth is set up in the cells\r\nof the part attacked, which in consequence becomes enormously enlarged\r\n(Fig. 38, _A_), single grains sometimes growing as large as a walnut.\r\nAs the spores ripen, the affected parts, which are at first white,\r\nbecome a livid gray, due to the black spores shining through the\r\noverlying white tissues. Finally the masses of spores burst through\r\nthe overlying cells, appearing like masses of soot, whence the popular\r\nname for the plant.\r\n\r\nThe remaining _Mycomycetes_ are pretty readily divisible into two\r\ngreat classes, based upon the arrangement of the spores. The first of\r\nthese is known as the _Ascomycetes_ (Sac fungi), the other the\r\n_Basidiomycetes_ (mushrooms, puff-balls, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--_Ascomycetes_ (SAC FUNGI).\r\n\r\nThis class includes a very great number of common plants, all\r\nresembling each other in producing spores in sacs (_asci_, sing.\r\n_ascus_) that are usually oblong in shape, and each containing eight\r\nspores, although the number is not always the same. Besides the spores\r\nformed in these sacs (ascospores), there are other forms produced in\r\nvarious ways.\r\n\r\nThere are two main divisions of the class, the first including only a\r\nfew forms, most of which are not likely to be met with by the student.\r\nIn these the spore sacs are borne directly upon the filaments without\r\nany protective covering. The only form that is at all common is a\r\nparasitic fungus (_Exoascus_) that attacks peach-trees, causing the\r\ndisease of the leaves known as \"curl.\"\r\n\r\nAll of the common _Ascomycetes_ belong to the second division, and\r\nhave the spore sacs contained in special structures called spore\r\nfruits, that may reach a diameter of several centimetres in a few\r\ncases, though ordinarily much smaller.\r\n\r\nAmong the simpler members of this group are the mildews\r\n(_Perisporiaceæ_), mostly parasitic forms, living upon the leaves and\r\nstems of flowering plants, sometimes causing serious injury by their\r\ndepredations. They form white or grayish downy films on the surface of\r\nthe plant, in certain stages looking like hoar-frost. Being very\r\ncommon, they may be readily obtained, and are easily studied. One of\r\nthe best species for study (_Podosphæra_) grows abundantly on the\r\nleaves of the dandelion, especially when the plants are growing under\r\nunfavorable conditions. The same species is also found on other plants\r\nof the same family. It may be found at almost any time during the\r\nsummer; but for studying, the spore fruits material should be\r\ncollected in late summer or early autumn. It at first appears as\r\nwhite, frost-like patches, growing dingier as it becomes older, and\r\ncareful scrutiny of the older specimens will show numerous brown or\r\nblackish specks scattered over the patches. These are the spore\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--_A_, spore-bearing filaments of the dandelion\r\nmildew (_Podosphæra_), × 150. _B_, a germinating spore, × 150. _C-F_,\r\ndevelopment of the spore fruit, × 300. _ar._ archicarp. _G_, a ripe\r\nspore fruit, × 150. _H_, the spore sac removed from the spore fruit,\r\n× 150. _I_, spore-bearing filament attacked by another fungus\r\n(_Cicinnobulus_), causing the enlargement of the basal cell, × 150.\r\n_J_, a more advanced stage, × 300. _K_, spores, × 300.]\r\n\r\n  For microscopical study, fresh material may be used, or, if\r\n  necessary, dried specimens. The latter, before mounting, should be\r\n  soaked for a short time in water, to which has been added a few\r\n  drops of caustic-potash solution. This will remove the brittleness,\r\n  and swell up the dried filaments to their original proportions. A\r\n  portion of the plant should be carefully scraped off the leaf on\r\n  which it is growing, thoroughly washed in pure water, and\r\n  transferred to a drop of water or very dilute glycerine, in which it\r\n  should be carefully spread out with needles. If air bubbles\r\n  interfere with the examination, they may be driven off with alcohol,\r\n  and then the cover glass put on. If the specimen is mounted in\r\n  glycerine, it will keep indefinitely, if care is taken to seal it\r\n  up. The plant consists of much-interlaced filaments, divided at\r\n  intervals by cross-walls.[6] They are nearly colorless, and the\r\n  contents are not conspicuous. These filaments send up vertical\r\n  branches (Fig. 39, _A_), that become divided into a series of short\r\n  cells by means of cross-walls. The cells thus formed are at first\r\n  cylindrical, but later bulge out at the sides, becoming broadly\r\n  oval, and finally become detached as spores (_conidia_). It is these\r\n  spores that give the frosty appearance to the early stages of the\r\n  fungus when seen with the naked eye. The spores fall off very easily\r\n  when ripe, and germinate quickly in water, sending out two or more\r\n  tubes that grow into filaments like those of the parent plant\r\n  (Fig. 39, _B_).\r\n\r\n[6] The filaments are attached to the surface of the leaf by suckers,\r\nwhich are not so readily seen in this species as in some others. A\r\nmildew growing abundantly in autumn on the garden chrysanthemum,\r\nhowever, shows them very satisfactorily if a bit of the epidermis of a\r\nleaf on which the fungus is just beginning to grow is sliced off with\r\na sharp razor and mounted in dilute glycerine, or water, removing the\r\nair with alcohol. These suckers are then seen to be globular bodies,\r\npenetrating the outer wall of the cell (Fig. 40).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Chrysanthemum mildew (_Erysiphe_), showing\r\nthe suckers (_h_) by which the filaments are attached to the leaf.\r\n_A_, surface view. _B_, vertical section of the leaf, × 300.]\r\n\r\n  The spore fruits, as already observed, are formed toward the end of\r\n  the season, and, in the species under consideration at least, appear\r\n  to be the result of a sexual process. The sexual organs (if they are\r\n  really such) are extremely simple, and, owing to their very small\r\n  size, are not easily found. They arise as short branches at a point\r\n  where two filaments cross; one of them (Fig. 39, _C_, _ar._), the\r\n  female cell, or \"archicarp,\" is somewhat larger than the other and\r\n  nearly oval in form, and soon becomes separated by a partition from\r\n  the filament that bears it. The other branch (antheridium) grows up\r\n  in close contact with the archicarp, and like it is shut off by a\r\n  partition from its filament. It is more slender than the archicarp,\r\n  but otherwise differs little from it. No actual communication can be\r\n  shown to be present between the two cells, and it is therefore still\r\n  doubtful whether fertilization really takes place. Shortly after\r\n  these organs are full-grown, several short branches grow up about\r\n  them, and soon completely envelop them (_D_, _E_). These branches\r\n  soon grow together, and cross-walls are formed in them, so that the\r\n  young spore fruit appears surrounded by a single layer of cells,\r\n  sufficiently transparent, however, to allow a view of the interior.\r\n\r\n  The antheridium undergoes no further change, but the archicarp soon\r\n  divides into two cells,--a small basal one and a larger upper cell.\r\n  There next grow from the inner surface of the covering cells, short\r\n  filaments, that almost completely fill the space between the\r\n  archicarp and the wall. An optical section of such a stage (Fig. 39,\r\n  _F_) shows a double wall and the two cells of the archicarp. The\r\n  spore fruit now enlarges rapidly, and the outer cells become first\r\n  yellow and then dark brown, the walls becoming thicker and harder as\r\n  they change color. Sometimes special filaments or appendages grow\r\n  out from their outer surfaces, and these are also dark-colored.\r\n  Shortly before the fruit is ripe, the upper cell of the archicarp,\r\n  which has increased many times in size, shows a division of its\r\n  contents into eight parts, each of which develops a wall and becomes\r\n  an oval spore. By crushing the ripe spore fruit, these spores still\r\n  enclosed in the mother cell (ascus) may be forced out (Fig. 39,\r\n  _H_). These spores do not germinate at once, but remain dormant\r\n  until the next year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Forms of mildews (_Erysiphe_). _A_,\r\n_Microsphæra_, a spore fruit, × 150. _B_, cluster of spore sacs of the\r\nsame, × 150. _C_, a single appendage, × 300. _D_, end of an appendage\r\nof _Uncinula_, × 300. _E_, appendage of _Phyllactinia_, × 150.]\r\n\r\n  Frequently other structures, resembling somewhat the spore fruits,\r\n  are found associated with them (Fig. 39, _I_, _K_), and were for a\r\n  long time supposed to be a special form of reproductive organ; but\r\n  they are now known to belong to another fungus (_Cicinnobulus_),\r\n  parasitic upon the mildew. They usually appear at the base of the\r\n  chains of conidia, causing the basal cell to enlarge to many times\r\n  its original size, and finally kill the young conidia, which shrivel\r\n  up. A careful examination reveals the presence of very fine\r\n  filaments within those of the mildew, which may be traced up to the\r\n  base of the conidial branch, where the receptacle of the parasite is\r\n  forming. The spores contained in these receptacles are very small\r\n  (Fig. 39, _K_), and when ripe exude in long, worm-shaped masses, if\r\n  the receptacle is placed in water.\r\n\r\nThe mildews may be divided into two genera: _Podosphæra_, with a\r\nsingle ascus in the spore fruit; and _Erysiphe_, with two or more. In\r\nthe latter the archicarp branches, each branch bearing a spore sac\r\n(Fig. 41, _B_).\r\n\r\nThe appendages growing out from the wall of the spore fruit are often\r\nvery beautiful in form, and the two genera given above are often\r\nsubdivided according to the form of these appendages.\r\n\r\nA common mould closely allied to the mildews is found on various\r\narticles of food when allowed to remain damp, and is also very common\r\non botanical specimens that have been poorly dried, and hence is often\r\ncalled \"herbarium mould\" (_Eurotium herbariorum_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--_A_, spore bearing filament of the herbarium\r\nmould (_Eurotium_), × 150. _B_, _C_, another species showing the way\r\nin which the spores are borne--optical section--× 150. _D_, spore\r\nfruit of the herbarium mould, × 150. _E_, spore sac. _F_, spores,\r\n× 300. _G_, spore-bearing filament of the common blue mould\r\n(_Penicillium_), × 300. _sp._ the spores.]\r\n\r\n  The conidia are of a greenish color, and produced on the ends of\r\n  upright branches which are enlarged at the end, and from which grow\r\n  out little prominences, which give rise to the conidia in the same\r\n  way as we have seen in the mildews (Fig. 42, _A_).\r\n\r\n  Spore fruits much like those of the mildews are formed later, and\r\n  are visible to the naked eye as little yellow grains (Fig. 42, _D_).\r\n  These contain numerous very small spore sacs (_E_), each with eight\r\n  spores.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous common species of _Eurotium_, differing in color\r\nand size, some being yellow or black, and larger than the ordinary\r\ngreen form.\r\n\r\nAnother form, common everywhere on mouldy food of all kinds, as well\r\nas in other situations, is the blue mould (_Penicillium_). This, in\r\ngeneral appearance, resembles almost exactly the herbarium mould, but\r\nis immediately distinguishable by a microscopic examination (Fig. 42,\r\n_G_).\r\n\r\n  In studying all of these forms, they may be mounted, as directed for\r\n  the black moulds, in dilute glycerine; but must be handled with\r\n  great care, as the spores become shaken off with the slightest jar.\r\n\r\nOf the larger _Ascomycetes_, the cup fungi (_Discomycetes_) may be\r\ntaken as types. The spore fruit in these forms is often of\r\nconsiderable size, and, as their name indicates, is open, having the\r\nform of a flat disc or cup. A brief description of a common one will\r\nsuffice to give an idea of their structure and development.\r\n\r\n_Ascobolus_ (Fig. 43) is a small, disc-shaped fungus, growing on horse\r\ndung. By keeping some of this covered with a bell jar for a week or\r\ntwo, so as to retain the moisture, at the end of this time a large\r\ncrop of the fungus will probably have made its appearance. The part\r\nvisible is the spore fruit (Fig. 43, _A_), of a light brownish color,\r\nand about as big as a pin-head.\r\n\r\n  Its development may be readily followed by teasing out in water the\r\n  youngest specimens that can be found, taking care to take up a\r\n  little of the substratum with it, as the earliest stages are too\r\n  small to be visible to the naked eye. The spore fruits arise from\r\n  filaments not unlike those of the mildews, and are preceded by the\r\n  formation of an archicarp composed of several cells, and readily\r\n  seen through the walls of the young fruit (Fig. 43, _B_). In the\r\n  study of the early stages, a potash solution will be found useful in\r\n  rendering them transparent.\r\n\r\n  The young fruit has much the same structure as that of the mildews,\r\n  but the spore sacs are much more numerous, and there are special\r\n  sterile filaments developed between them. If the young spore fruit\r\n  is treated with chlor-iodide of zinc, it is rendered quite\r\n  transparent, and the young spore sacs colored a beautiful blue, so\r\n  that they are readily distinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--_A_, a small cup fungus (_Ascobolus_), × 5.\r\n_B_, young spore fruit, × 300. _ar._ archicarp. _C_, an older one,\r\n× 150. _ar._ archicarp. _sp._ young spore sacs. _D_, section through a\r\nfull-grown spore fruit (partly diagrammatic), × 25. _sp._ spore sacs.\r\n_E_, development of spore sacs and spores: i-iii, × 300; iv, × 150.\r\n_F_, ripe spores. _G_, a sterile filament (paraphysis), × 300. _H_,\r\nlarge scarlet cup fungus (_Peziza_), natural size.]\r\n\r\n  The development of the spore sacs may be traced by carefully\r\n  crushing the young spore fruits in water. The young spore sacs\r\n  (Fig. 43, _E_ i) are colorless, with granular protoplasm, in which a\r\n  nucleus can often be easily seen. The nucleus subsequently divides\r\n  repeatedly, until there are eight nuclei, about which the protoplasm\r\n  collects to form as many oval masses, each of which develops a wall\r\n  and becomes a spore (Figs. ii-iv). These are imbedded in protoplasm,\r\n  which is at first granular, but afterwards becomes almost\r\n  transparent. As the spores ripen, the wall acquires a beautiful\r\n  violet-purple color, changing later to a dark purple-brown, and\r\n  marked with irregular longitudinal ridges (Fig. 43, _F_). The\r\n  full-grown spore sacs (Fig. 43, _E_, _W_) are oblong in shape, and\r\n  attached by a short stalk. The sterile filaments between them often\r\n  become curiously enlarged at the end (_G_). As the spore fruit\r\n  ripens, it opens at the top, and spreads out so as to expose the\r\n  spore sacs as they discharge their contents (Fig. 43, _D_).\r\n\r\nOf the larger cup fungi, those belonging to the genus _Peziza_\r\n(Fig. 43, _H_) are common, growing on bits of rotten wood on the\r\nground in woods. They are sometimes bright scarlet or orange-red, and\r\nvery showy. Another curious form is the morel (_Morchella_), common in\r\nthe spring in dry woods. It is stalked like a mushroom, but the\r\nsurface of the conical cap is honeycombed with shallow depressions,\r\nlined with the spore sacs.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER _Lichenes_.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of lichens are comprised a large number of fungi,\r\ndiffering a good deal in structure, but most of them not unlike the\r\ncup fungi. They are, with few exceptions, parasitic upon various forms\r\nof algæ, with which they are so intimately associated as to form\r\napparently a single plant. They grow everywhere on exposed rocks, on\r\nthe ground, trunks of trees, fences, etc., and are found pretty much\r\nthe world over. Among the commonest of plants are the lichens of the\r\ngenus _Parmelia_ (Fig. 44, _A_), growing everywhere on tree trunks,\r\nwooden fences, etc., forming gray, flattened expansions, with much\r\nindented and curled margins. When dry, the plant is quite brittle, but\r\non moistening becomes flexible, and at the same time more or less\r\ndecidedly green in color. The lower surface is white or brown, and\r\noften develops root-like processes by which it is fastened to the\r\nsubstratum. Sometimes small fragments of the plant become detached in\r\nsuch numbers as to form a grayish powder over certain portions of it.\r\nThese, when supplied with sufficient moisture, will quickly produce\r\nnew individuals.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the spore fruits are to be met with flat discs of a\r\nreddish brown color, two or three millimetres in diameter, and closely\r\nresembling a small cup fungus. They are at first almost closed, but\r\nexpand as they mature (Fig. 44, _A_, _ap._).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--_A_, a common lichen (_Parmelia_), of the\r\nnatural size. _ap._ spore fruit. _B_, section through one of the spore\r\nfruits, × 5. _C_, section through the body of a gelatinous lichen\r\n(_Collema_), showing the _Nostoc_ individuals surrounded by the fungus\r\nfilaments, × 300. _D_, a spermagonium of _Collema_, × 25. _E_, a\r\nsingle _Nostoc_ thread. _F_, spore sacs and paraphyses of _Usnea_,\r\n× 300. _G_, _Protococcus_ cells and fungus filaments of _Usnea_.]\r\n\r\n  If a thin vertical section of the plant is made and sufficiently\r\n  magnified, it is found to be made up of somewhat irregular,\r\n  thick-walled, colorless filaments, divided by cross-walls as in the\r\n  other sac-fungi. In the central parts of the plant these are rather\r\n  loose, but toward the outside become very closely interwoven and\r\n  often grown together, so as to form a tough rind. Among the\r\n  filaments of the outer portion are numerous small green cells, that\r\n  closer examination shows to be individuals of _Protococcus_, or some\r\n  similar green algæ, upon which the lichen is parasitic. These are\r\n  sufficiently abundant to form a green line just inside the rind if\r\n  the section is examined with a simple lens (Fig. 44, _B_).\r\n\r\n  The spore fruits of the lichens resemble in all essential respects\r\n  those of the cup fungi, and the spore sacs (Fig. 44, _F_) are much\r\n  the same, usually, though not always, containing eight spores, which\r\n  are sometimes two-celled. The sterile filaments between the spore\r\n  sacs usually have thickened ends, which are dark-colored, and give\r\n  the color to the inner surface of the spore fruit.\r\n\r\n  In Figure 45, _H_, is shown one of the so-called \"_Soredia_,\"[7] a\r\n  group of the algæ, upon which the lichen is parasitic, surrounded by\r\n  some of the filaments, the whole separating spontaneously from the\r\n  plant and giving rise to a new one.\r\n\r\n[7] Sing. _soredium_.\r\n\r\nOwing to the toughness of the filaments, the finer structure of the\r\nlichens is often difficult to study, and free use of caustic potash is\r\nnecessary to soften and make them manageable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Forms of lichens. _A_, a branch with lichens\r\ngrowing upon it, one-half natural size. _B_, _Usnea_, natural size.\r\n_ap._ spore fruit. _C_, _Sticta_, one-half natural size. _D_,\r\n_Peltigera_, one-half natural size. _ap._ spore fruit. _E_, a single\r\nspore fruit, × 2. _F_, _Cladonia_, natural size. _G_, a piece of bark\r\nfrom a beech, with a crustaceous lichen (_Graphis_) growing upon it,\r\n× 2. _ap._ spore fruit. _H_, _Soredium_ of a lichen, × 300.]\r\n\r\nAccording to their form, lichens are sometimes divided into the bushy\r\n(fruticose), leafy (frondose), incrusting (crustaceous), and\r\ngelatinous. Of the first, the long gray _Usnea_ (Fig. 45, _A_, _B_),\r\nwhich drapes the branches of trees in swamps, is a familiar example;\r\nof the second, _Parmelia_, _Sticta_ (Fig. 45, _C_) and _Peltigera_\r\n(_D_) are types; of the third, _Graphis_ (_G_), common on the trunks\r\nof beech-trees, to which it closely adheres; and of the last,\r\n_Collema_ (Fig. 44, _C_, _D_, _E_), a dark greenish, gelatinous form,\r\ngrowing on mossy tree trunks, and looking like a colony of _Nostoc_,\r\nwhich indeed it is, but differing from an ordinary colony in being\r\npenetrated everywhere by the filaments of the fungus growing upon it.\r\n\r\n  Not infrequently in this form, as well as in other lichens, special\r\n  cavities, known as spermogonia (Fig. 44, _D_), are found, in which\r\n  excessively small spores are produced, which have been claimed to\r\n  be male reproductive cells, but the latest investigations do not\r\n  support this theory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Branch of a plum-tree attacked by black knot.\r\nNatural size.]\r\n\r\nThe last group of the _Ascomycetes_ are the \"black fungi,\"\r\n_Pyrenomycetes_, represented by the black knot of cherry and plum\r\ntrees, shown in Figure 46. They are mainly distinguished from the cup\r\nfungi by producing their spore sacs in closed cavities. Some are\r\nparasites; others live on dead wood, leaves, etc., forming very hard\r\nmasses, generally black in color, giving them their common name. Owing\r\nto the hardness of the masses, they are very difficult to manipulate;\r\nand, as the structure is not essentially different from that of the\r\n_Discomycetes_, the details will not be entered into here.\r\n\r\nOf the parasitic forms, one of the best known is the \"ergot\" of rye,\r\nmore or less used in medicine. Other forms are known that attack\r\ninsects, particularly caterpillars, which are killed by their attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFUNGI--_Continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS _Basidiomycetes_.\r\n\r\nThe _Basidiomycetes_ include the largest and most highly developed of\r\nthe fungi, among which are many familiar forms, such as the mushrooms,\r\ntoadstools, puff-balls, etc. Besides these large and familiar forms,\r\nthere are other simpler and smaller ones that, according to the latest\r\ninvestigations, are probably related to them, though formerly regarded\r\nas constituting a distinct group. The most generally known of these\r\nlower _Basidiomycetes_ are the so-called rusts. The larger\r\n_Basidiomycetes_ are for the most part saprophytes, living in decaying\r\nvegetable matter, but a few are true parasites upon trees and others\r\nof the flowering plants.\r\n\r\nAll of the group are characterized by the production of spores at the\r\ntop of special cells known as basidia,[8] the number produced upon a\r\nsingle basidium varying from a single one to several.\r\n\r\n[8] Sing. _basidium_.\r\n\r\nOf the lower _Basidiomycetes_, the rusts (_Uredineæ_) offer common and\r\neasily procurable forms for study. They are exclusively parasitic in\r\ntheir habits, growing within the tissues of the higher land plants,\r\nwhich they often injure seriously. They receive their popular name\r\nfrom the reddish color of the masses of spores that, when ripe, burst\r\nthrough the epidermis of the host plant. Like many other fungi, the\r\nrusts have several kinds of spores, which are often produced on\r\ndifferent hosts; thus one kind of wheat rust lives during part of its\r\nlife within the leaves of the barberry, where it produces spores quite\r\ndifferent from those upon the wheat; the cedar rust, in the same way,\r\nis found at one time attacking the leaves of the wild crab-apple and\r\nthorn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--_A_, a branch of red cedar attacked by a rust\r\n(_Gymnosporangium_), causing a so-called \"cedar apple,\" × ½. _B_,\r\nspores of the same, one beginning to germinate, × 300. _C_, a spore\r\nthat has germinated, each cell producing a short, divided filament\r\n(basidium), which in turn gives rise to secondary spores (_sp._),\r\n× 300. _D_, part of the leaf of a hawthorn attacked by the cluster cup\r\nstage of the same fungus, upper side showing spermogonia, natural\r\nsize. _E_, cluster cups (_Roestelia_) of the same fungus, natural\r\nsize. _F_, tip of a leaf of the Indian turnip (_Arisæma_), bearing the\r\ncluster cup (_Æcidium_) stage of a rust, × 2. _G_, vertical section\r\nthrough a young cluster cup. _H_, similar section through a mature\r\none, × 50. _I_, germinating spores of _H_, × 300. _J_, part of a corn\r\nleaf, with black rust, natural size. _K_, red rust spore of the wheat\r\nrust (_Puccinia graminis_), × 300. _L_, forms of black-rust spores: i,\r\n_Uromyces_; ii, _Puccinia_; iii, _Phragmidium_.]\r\n\r\nThe first form met with in most rusts is sometimes called the\r\n\"cluster-cup\" stage, and in many species is the only stage known. In\r\nFigure 47, _F_, is shown a bit of the leaf of the Indian turnip\r\n(_Arisæma_) affected by one of these \"cluster-cup\" forms. To the naked\r\neye, or when slightly magnified, the masses of spores appear as bright\r\norange spots, mostly upon the lower surface. The affected leaves are\r\nmore or less checked in their growth, and the upper surface shows\r\nlighter blotches, corresponding to the areas below that bear the\r\ncluster cups. These at first appear as little elevations of a\r\nyellowish color, and covered with the epidermis; but as the spores\r\nripen they break through the epidermis, which is turned back around\r\nthe opening, the whole forming a little cup filled with a bright\r\norange red powder, composed of the loose masses of spores.\r\n\r\n  Putting a piece of the affected leaf between two pieces of pith so\r\n  as to hold it firmly, with a little care thin vertical sections of\r\n  the leaf, including one of the cups, may be made, and mounted,\r\n  either in water or glycerine, removing the air with alcohol. We find\r\n  that the leaf is thickened at this point owing to a diseased growth\r\n  of the cells of the leaf, induced by the action of the fungus. The\r\n  mass of spores (Fig. 47, _G_) is surrounded by a closely woven mass\r\n  of filaments, forming a nearly globular cavity. Occupying the bottom\r\n  of the cup are closely set, upright filaments, each bearing a row of\r\n  spores, arranged like those of the white rusts, but so closely\r\n  crowded as to be flattened at the sides. The outer rows have\r\n  thickened walls, and are grown together so as to form the wall of\r\n  the cup.\r\n\r\n  The spores are filled with granular protoplasm, in which are\r\n  numerous drops of orange-yellow oil, to which is principally due\r\n  their color. As the spores grow, they finally break the overlying\r\n  epidermis, and then become rounded as the pressure from the sides is\r\n  relieved. They germinate within a few hours if placed in water,\r\n  sending out a tube, into which pass the contents of the spore\r\n  (Fig. 47, _I_).\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable of the rusts is the cedar rust\r\n(_Gymnosporangium_), forming the growths known as \"cedar apples,\"\r\noften met with on the red cedar. These are rounded masses, sometimes\r\nas large as a walnut, growing upon the small twigs of the cedar\r\n(Fig. 47, _A_). This is a morbid growth of the same nature as those\r\nproduced by the white rusts and smuts. If one of these cedar apples is\r\nexamined in the late autumn or winter, it will be found to have the\r\nsurface dotted with little elevations covered by the epidermis, and on\r\nremoving this we find masses of forming spores. These rupture the\r\nepidermis early in the spring, and appear then as little spikes of a\r\nrusty red color. If they are kept wet for a few hours, they enlarge\r\nrapidly by the absorption of water, and may reach a length of four or\r\nfive centimetres, becoming gelatinous in consistence, and sometimes\r\nalmost entirely hiding the surface of the \"apple.\" In this stage the\r\nfungus is extremely conspicuous, and may frequently be met with after\r\nrainy weather in the spring.\r\n\r\n  This orange jelly, as shown by the microscope, is made up of\r\n  elongated two-celled spores (teleuto spores), attached to long\r\n  gelatinous stalks (Fig. 47, _B_). They are thick-walled, and the\r\n  contents resemble those of the cluster-cup spores described above.\r\n\r\n  To study the earlier stages of germination it is best to choose\r\n  specimens in which the masses of spores have not been moistened. By\r\n  thoroughly wetting these, and keeping moist, the process of\r\n  germination may be readily followed. Many usually begin to grow\r\n  within twenty-four hours or less. Each cell of the spore sends out a\r\n  tube (Fig. 47, _C_), through an opening in the outer wall, and this\r\n  tube rapidly elongates, the spore contents passing into it, until a\r\n  short filament (basidium) is formed, which then divides into several\r\n  short cells. Each cell develops next a short, pointed process, which\r\n  swells up at the end, gradually taking up all the contents of the\r\n  cell, until a large oval spore (_sp._) is formed at the tip,\r\n  containing all the protoplasm of the cell.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made showing that these spores do not germinate\r\nupon the cedar, but upon the hawthorn or crab-apple, where they\r\nproduce the cluster-cup stage often met with late in the summer. The\r\naffected leaves show bright orange-yellow spots about a centimetre in\r\ndiameter (Fig. 47, _D_), and considerably thicker than the other parts\r\nof the leaf. On the upper side of these spots may be seen little black\r\nspecks, which microscopic examination shows to be spermogonia,\r\nresembling those of the lichens. Later, on the lower surface, appear\r\nthe cluster cups, whose walls are prolonged so that they form little\r\ntubular processes of considerable length (Fig. 47, _E_).\r\n\r\n  In most rusts the teleuto spores are produced late in the summer or\r\n  autumn, and remain until the following spring before they germinate.\r\n  They are very thick-walled, the walls being dark-colored, so that in\r\n  mass they appear black, and constitute the \"black-rust\" stage\r\n  (Fig. 47, _J_). Associated with these, but formed earlier, and\r\n  germinating immediately, are often to be found large single-celled\r\n  spores, borne on long stalks. They are usually oval in form, rather\r\n  thin-walled, but the outer surface sometimes provided with little\r\n  points. The contents are reddish, so that in mass they appear of the\r\n  color of iron rust, and cause the \"red rust\" of wheat and other\r\n  plants, upon which they are growing.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the rusts is based mainly upon the size and\r\nshape of the teleuto spores where they are known, as the cluster-cup\r\nand red-rust stages are pretty much the same in all. Of the commoner\r\ngenera _Melampsora_, and _Uromyces_ (Fig. 47, _L_ i), have unicellular\r\nteleuto spores; _Puccinia_ (ii) and _Gymnosporangium_, two-celled\r\nspores; _Triphragmium_, three-celled; and _Phragmidium_ (iii), four or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe rusts are so abundant that a little search can scarcely fail to\r\nfind some or all of the stages. The cluster-cup stages are best\r\nexamined fresh, or from alcoholic material; the teleuto spores may be\r\ndried without affecting them.\r\n\r\nProbably the best-known member of the group is the wheat rust\r\n(_Puccinia graminis_), which causes so much damage to wheat and\r\nsometimes to other grains. The red-rust stage may be found in early\r\nsummer; the black-rust spores in the stubble and dead leaves in the\r\nautumn or spring, forming black lines rupturing the epidermis.\r\n\r\nProbably to be associated with the lower _Basidiomycetes_ are the\r\nlarge fungi of which _Tremella_ (Fig. 51, _A_) is an example. They are\r\njelly-like forms, horny and somewhat brittle when dry, but becoming\r\nsoft when moistened. They are common, growing on dead twigs, logs,\r\netc., and are usually brown or orange-yellow in color.\r\n\r\nOf the higher _Basidiomycetes_, the toadstools, mushrooms, etc., are\r\nthe highest, and any common form will serve for study. One of the most\r\naccessible and easily studied forms is _Coprinus_, of which there are\r\nseveral species growing on the excrement of various herbivorous\r\nanimals. They not infrequently appear on horse manure that has been\r\nkept covered with a glass for some time, as described for _Ascobolus_.\r\nAfter two or three weeks some of these fungi are very likely to make\r\ntheir appearance, and new ones continue to develop for a long time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--_A_, young. _B_, full-grown fruit of a\r\ntoadstool (_Coprinus_), × 2. _C_, under side of the cap, showing the\r\nradiating \"gills,\" or spore-bearing plates. _D_, section across one of\r\nthe young gills, × 150. _E_, _F_, portions of gills from a nearly ripe\r\nfruit, × 300. _sp._ spores. _x_, sterile cell. In _F_, a basidium is\r\nshown, with the young spores just forming. _G_, _H_, young fruits,\r\n× 50.]\r\n\r\nThe first trace of the plant, visible to the naked eye, is a little\r\ndowny, white speck, just large enough to be seen. This rapidly\r\nincreases in size, becoming oblong in shape, and growing finally\r\nsomewhat darker in color; and by the time it reaches a height of a few\r\nmillimetres a short stalk becomes perceptible, and presently the whole\r\nassumes the form of a closed umbrella. The top is covered with little\r\nprominences, that diminish in number and size toward the bottom. After\r\nthe cap reaches its full size, the stalk begins to grow, slowly at\r\nfirst, but finally with great rapidity, reaching a height of several\r\ncentimetres within a few hours. At the same time that the stalk is\r\nelongating, the cap spreads out, radial clefts appearing on its upper\r\nsurface, which flatten out very much as the folds of an umbrella are\r\nstretched as it opens, and the spaces between the clefts appear as\r\nridges, comparable to the ribs of the umbrella (Fig. 48, _B_). The\r\nunder side of the cap has a number of ridges running from the centre\r\nto the margin, and of a black color, due to the innumerable spores\r\ncovering their surface (_C_). Almost as soon as the umbrella opens,\r\nthe spores are shed, and the whole structure shrivels up and\r\ndissolves, leaving almost no trace behind.\r\n\r\n  If we examine microscopically the youngest specimens procurable,\r\n  freeing from air with alcohol, and mounting in water or dilute\r\n  glycerine, we find it to be a little, nearly globular mass of\r\n  colorless filaments, with numerous cross-walls, the whole arising\r\n  from similar looser filaments imbedded in the substratum (Fig. 48,\r\n  _G_). If the specimen is not too young, a denser central portion can\r\n  be made out, and in still older ones (Fig. 48, _H_) this central\r\n  mass has assumed the form of a short, thick stalk, crowned by a flat\r\n  cap, the whole invested by a loose mass of filaments that merge more\r\n  or less gradually into the central portion. By the time the spore\r\n  fruit (for this structure corresponds to the spore fruit of the\r\n  _Ascomycetes_) reaches a height of two or three millimetres, and is\r\n  plainly visible to the naked eye, the cap grows downward at the\r\n  margins, so as to almost entirely conceal the stalk. A longitudinal\r\n  section of such a stage shows the stalk to be composed of a\r\n  small-celled, close tissue becoming looser in the cap, on whose\r\n  inner surface the spore-bearing ridges (\"gills\" or _Lamellæ_) have\r\n  begun to develop. Some of these run completely to the edge of the\r\n  cap, others only part way. To study their structure, make\r\n  cross-sections of the cap of a nearly full-grown, but unopened,\r\n  specimen, and this will give numerous sections of the young gills.\r\n  We find them to be flat plates, composed within of loosely\r\n  interwoven filaments, whose ends stand out at right angles to the\r\n  surface of the gills, forming a layer of closely-set upright cells\r\n  (basidia) (Fig. 48, _D_). These are at first all alike, but later\r\n  some of them become club-shaped, and develop at the end several\r\n  (usually four) little points, at the end of which spores are formed\r\n  in exactly the same way as we saw in the germinating teleuto spores\r\n  of the cedar rust, all the protoplasm of the basidium passing into\r\n  the growing spores (Fig. 48, _E_, _F_). The ripe spores (_E_, _sp._)\r\n  are oval, and possess a firm, dark outer wall. Occasionally some of\r\n  the basidia develop into very large sterile cells (E, _x_),\r\n  projecting far beyond the others, and often reaching the neighboring\r\n  gill.\r\n\r\nSimilar in structure and development to _Coprinus_ are all the large\r\nand common forms; but they differ much in the position of the\r\nspore-bearing tissue, as well as in the form and size of the whole\r\nspore fruit. They are sometimes divided, according to the position of\r\nthe spores, into three orders: the closed-fruited (_Angiocarpous_)\r\nforms, the half-closed (_Hemi-angiocarpous_), and the open or\r\nnaked-fruited forms (_Gymnocarpous_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--_Basidiomycetes_. _A_, common puff-ball\r\n(_Lycoperdon_). _B_, earth star (_Geaster_). _A_, × ¼. _B_, one-half\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nOf the first, the puff-balls (Fig. 49) are common examples. One\r\nspecies, the giant puff-ball (_Lycoperdon giganteum_), often reaches a\r\ndiameter of thirty to forty centimetres. The earth stars (_Geaster_)\r\nhave a double covering to the spore fruit, the outer one splitting at\r\nmaturity into strips (Fig. 49, _B_). Another pretty and common form is\r\nthe little birds'-nest fungus (_Cyathus_), growing on rotten wood or\r\nsoil containing much decaying vegetable matter (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Birds'-nest fungus (_Cyathus_). _A_, young.\r\n_B_, full grown. _C_, section through _B_, showing the \"sporangia\"\r\n(_sp._). All twice the natural size.]\r\n\r\nIn the second order the spores are at first protected, as we have seen\r\nin _Coprinus_, which belongs to this order, but finally become\r\nexposed. Here belong the toadstools and mushrooms (Fig. 51, _B_), the\r\nlarge shelf-shaped fungi (_Polyporus_), so common on tree trunks and\r\nrotten logs (Fig. 51, _C_, _D_, _E_), and the prickly fungus\r\n(_Hydnum_) (Fig. 51, _G_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Forms of _Basidiomycetes_. _A_, _Tremella_,\r\none-half natural size. _B_, _Agaricus_, natural size. _C_, _E_,\r\n_Polyporus_: _C_, × ½; _E_, × ¼. _D_, part of the under surface of\r\n_D_, natural size. _F_, _Clavaria_, a small piece, natural size. _G_,\r\n_Hydnum_, a piece of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nOf the last, or naked-fruited forms, the commonest belong to the\r\ngenus _Clavaria_ (Fig. 51, _F_), smooth-branching forms, usually of a\r\nbrownish color, bearing the spores directly upon the surface of the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM IV.\r\n\r\nBRYOPHYTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bryophytes, or mosses, are for the most part land plants, though a\r\nfew are aquatic, and with very few exceptions are richly supplied with\r\nchlorophyll. They are for the most part small plants, few of them\r\nbeing over a few centimetres in height; but, nevertheless, compared\r\nwith the plants that we have heretofore studied, quite complex in\r\ntheir structure. The lowest members of the group are flattened,\r\ncreeping plants, or a few of them floating aquatics, without distinct\r\nstem and leaves; but the higher ones have a pretty well-developed\r\ncentral axis or stem, with simple leaves attached.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes--I. Liverworts (_Hepaticæ_), and II. Mosses\r\n(_Musci_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--THE LIVERWORTS.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest of this class, and to be had at any time, is\r\nnamed _Madotheca_. It is one of the highest of the class, having\r\ndistinct stem and leaves. It grows most commonly on the shady side of\r\ntree trunks, being most luxuriant near the ground, where the supply of\r\nmoisture is most constant. It also occurs on stones and rocks in moist\r\nplaces. It closely resembles a true moss in general appearance, and\r\nfrom the scale-like arrangement of its leaves is sometimes called\r\n\"scale moss.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaves (Fig. 52, _A_, _B_) are rounded in outline unequally,\r\ntwo-lobed, and arranged in two rows on the upper side of the stem, so\r\nclosely overlapping as to conceal it entirely. On the under side are\r\nsimilar but smaller leaves, less regularly disposed. The stems branch\r\nat intervals, the branches spreading out laterally so that the whole\r\nplant is decidedly flattened. On the under side are fine, whitish\r\nhairs, that fasten it to the substratum. If we examine a number of\r\nspecimens, especially early in the spring, a difference will be\r\nobserved in the plants. Some of them will be found to bear peculiar\r\nstructures (Fig. 52, _C_, _D_), in which the spores are produced.\r\nThese are called \"sporogonia.\" They are at first globular, but when\r\nripe open by means of four valves, and discharge a greenish brown mass\r\nof spores. An examination of the younger parts of the same plants will\r\nprobably show small buds (Fig. 54, _H_), which contain the female\r\nreproductive organs, from which the sporogonia arise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--_A_, part of a plant of a leafy liverwort\r\n(_Madotheca_), × 2. _B_, part of the same, seen from below, × 4. _C_,\r\na branch with two open sporogonia (_sp._), × 4. _D_, a single\r\nsporogonium, × 8.]\r\n\r\nOn other plants may be found numerous short side branches (Fig. 53,\r\n_B_), with very closely set leaves. If these are carefully separated,\r\nthe antheridia can just be seen as minute whitish globules, barely\r\nvisible to the naked eye. Plants that, like this one, have the male\r\nand female reproductive organs on distinct plants, are said to be\r\n\"diœcious.\"\r\n\r\n  A microscopical examination of the stem and leaves shows their\r\n  structure to be very simple. The former is cylindrical, and composed\r\n  of nearly uniform elongated cells, with straight cross-walls. The\r\n  leaves consist of a single layer of small, roundish cells, which,\r\n  like those of the stem, contain numerous rounded chloroplasts, to\r\n  which is due their dark green color.\r\n\r\n  The tissues are developed from a single apical cell, but it is\r\n  difficult to obtain good sections through it.\r\n\r\n  The antheridia are borne singly at the bases of the leaves on the\r\n  special branches already described (Fig. 53, _A_, _an._). By\r\n  carefully dissecting with needles such a branch in a drop of water,\r\n  some of the antheridia will usually be detached uninjured, and may\r\n  be readily studied, the full-grown ones being just large enough to\r\n  be seen with the naked eye. They are globular bodies, attached by a\r\n  stalk composed of two rows of cells. The globular portion consists\r\n  of a wall of chlorophyll-bearing cells, composed of two layers\r\n  below, but single above (Fig. 53, _C_). Within is a mass of\r\n  excessively small cells, each of which contains a spermatozoid. In\r\n  the young antheridium (_A_, _an._) the wall is single throughout,\r\n  and the central cells few in number. To study them in their natural\r\n  position, thin longitudinal sections of the antheridial branch\r\n  should be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--_A_, end of a branch from a male plant of\r\n_Madotheca_. The small side branchlets bear the antheridia, × 2. _B_,\r\ntwo young antheridia (_an._), the upper one seen in optical section,\r\nthe lower one from without, × 150. _C_, a ripe antheridium, optical\r\nsection, × 50. _D_, sperm cells with young spermatozoids. _E_, ripe\r\nspermatozoids, × 600.]\r\n\r\n  When ripe, if brought into water, the antheridium bursts at the top\r\n  into a number of irregular lobes that curl back and allow the mass\r\n  of sperm cells to escape. The spermatozoids, which are derived\r\n  principally from the nucleus of the sperm cells (53, _D_) are so\r\n  small as to make a satisfactory examination possible only with very\r\n  powerful lenses. The ripe spermatozoid is coiled in a flat spiral\r\n  (53, _E_), and has two excessively delicate cilia, visible only\r\n  under the most favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\n  The female organ in the bryophytes is called an \"archegonium,\" and\r\n  differs considerably from anything we have yet studied, but recalls\r\n  somewhat the structure of the oögonium of _Chara_. They are found in\r\n  groups, contained in little bud-like branches (54, _H_). In order to\r\n  study them, a plant should be chosen that has numbers of such buds,\r\n  and the smallest that can be found should be used. Those containing\r\n  the young archegonia are very small; but after one has been\r\n  fertilized, the leaves enclosing it grow much larger, and the bud\r\n  becomes quite conspicuous, being surrounded by two or three\r\n  comparatively large leaves. By dissecting the young buds, archegonia\r\n  in all stages of growth may be found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--_A-D_, development of the archegonium of\r\n_Madotheca_. _B_, surface view, the others in optical section. _o_,\r\negg cell, × 150. _E_, base of a fertilized archegonium, containing a\r\nyoung embryo (_em._), × 150. _F_, margin of one of the leaves\r\nsurrounding the archegonia. _G_, young sporogonium still surrounded by\r\nthe much enlarged base of the archegonium. _h_, neck of the\r\narchegonium. _ar._ abortive archegonia, × 12. _H_, short branch\r\ncontaining the young sporogonium, × 4.]\r\n\r\n  When very young the archegonium is composed of an axial row of three\r\n  cells, surrounded by a single outer layer of cells, the upper ones\r\n  forming five or six regular rows, which are somewhat twisted\r\n  (Fig. 54, _A_, _B_). As it becomes older, the lower part enlarges\r\n  slightly, the whole looking something like a long-necked flask (_C_,\r\n  _D_). The centre of the neck is occupied by a single row of cells\r\n  (canal cells), with more granular contents than the outer cells, the\r\n  lowest cell of the row being somewhat larger than the others\r\n  (Fig. 54, _C_, _o_). When nearly ripe, the division walls of the\r\n  canal cells are absorbed, and the protoplasm of the lowest cell\r\n  contracts and forms a globular naked cell, the egg cell (_D_, _o_).\r\n  If a ripe archegonium is placed in water, it soon opens at the top,\r\n  and the contents of the canal cells are forced out, leaving a clear\r\n  channel down to the egg cell. If the latter is not fertilized, the\r\n  inner walls of the neck cells turn brown, and the egg cell dies; but\r\n  if a spermatozoid penetrates to the egg cell, the latter develops a\r\n  wall and begins to grow, forming the embryo or young sporogonium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Longitudinal section of a nearly full-grown\r\nsporogonium of _Madotheca_, which has not, however, broken through the\r\noverlying cells, × 25. _sp._ cavity in which the spores are formed.\r\n_ar._ abortive archegonium.]\r\n\r\n  The first division wall to be formed in the embryo is transverse,\r\n  and is followed by vertical ones (Fig. 54, _E_, _em._). As the\r\n  embryo enlarges, the walls of the basal part of the archegonium grow\r\n  rapidly, so that the embryo remains enclosed in the archegonium\r\n  until it is nearly full-grown (Fig. 55). As it increases in size, it\r\n  becomes differentiated into three parts: a wedge-shaped base or\r\n  \"foot\" penetrating downward into the upper part of the plant, and\r\n  serving to supply the embryo with nourishment; second, a stalk\r\n  supporting the third part, the capsule or spore-bearing portion of\r\n  the fruit. The capsule is further differentiated into a wall, which\r\n  later becomes dark colored, and a central cavity, in which are\r\n  developed special cells, some of which by further division into four\r\n  parts produce the spores, while the others, elongating enormously,\r\n  give rise to special cells, called elaters (Fig. 56, _B_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Spore (_A_) and two elaters (_B_) of\r\n_Madotheca_, × 300.]\r\n\r\n  The ripe spores are nearly globular, contain chlorophyll and drops\r\n  of oil, and the outer wall is brown and covered with fine points\r\n  (Fig. 56, _A_). The elaters are long-pointed cells, having on the\r\n  inner surface of the wall a single or double dark brown spiral band.\r\n  These bands are susceptible to changes in moisture, and by their\r\n  movements probably assist in scattering the spores after the\r\n  sporogonium opens.\r\n\r\nJust before the spores are ripe, the stalk of the sporogonium\r\nelongates rapidly, carrying up the capsule, which breaks through the\r\narchegonium wall, and finally splits into four valves, and discharges\r\nthe spores.\r\n\r\nThere are four orders of the liverworts represented in the United\r\nStates, three of which differ from the one we have studied in being\r\nflattened plants, without distinct stems and leaves,--at least, the\r\nleaves when present are reduced to little scales upon the lower\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe first order (_Ricciaceæ_) are small aquatic forms, or grow on damp\r\nground or rotten logs. They are not common forms, and not likely to be\r\nencountered by the student. One of the floating species is shown in\r\nfigure 57, _A_.\r\n\r\nThe second order, the horned liverworts (_Anthoceroteæ_), are\r\nsometimes to be met with in late summer and autumn, forms growing\r\nmostly on damp ground, and at once recognizable by their long-pointed\r\nsporogonia, which open when ripe by two valves, like a bean pod\r\n(Fig. 57, _B_).\r\n\r\nThe third order (_Marchantiaceæ_) includes the most conspicuous\r\nmembers of the whole class. Some of them, like the common liverwort\r\n(_Marchantia_), shown in Figure 57, _F_, _K_, and the giant liverwort\r\n(Fig. 57, _D_), are large and common forms, growing on the ground in\r\nshady places, the former being often found also in greenhouses. They\r\nare fastened to the ground by numerous fine, silky hairs, and the\r\ntissues are well differentiated, the upper surface of the plant having\r\na well-marked epidermis, with peculiar breathing pores, large enough\r\nto be seen with the naked eye (Fig. 57, _E_, _J_, _K_) Each of these\r\nis situated in the centre of a little area (Fig. 57, _E_), and beneath\r\nit is a large air space, into which the chlorophyll-bearing cells\r\n(_cl._) of the plant project (_J_).\r\n\r\nThe sexual organs are often produced in these forms upon special\r\nbranches (_G_), or the antheridia may be sunk in discs on the upper\r\nside of the stem (_D_, _an._).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Forms of liverworts. _A_, _Riccia_, natural\r\nsize. _B_, _Anthoceros_ (horned liverwort), natural size. _sp._\r\nsporogonia. _C_, _Lunularia_, natural size, _x_, buds. _D_, giant\r\nliverwort (_Conocephalus_), natural size. _an._ antheridial disc. _E_,\r\nsmall piece of the epidermis, showing the breathing pores, × 2. _F_,\r\ncommon liverwort (_Marchantia_), × 2. _x_, cups containing buds. _G_,\r\narchegonial branch of common liverwort, natural size. _H_, two young\r\nbuds from the common liverwort, × 150. _I_, a full-grown bud, × 25.\r\n_J_, vertical section through the body of _Marchantia_, cutting\r\nthrough a breathing pore (_s_), × 50. _K_, surface view of a breathing\r\npore, × 150. _L_, a leafy liverwort (_Jungermannia_). _sp._\r\nsporogonium, × 2.]\r\n\r\nSome forms, like _Marchantia_ and _Lunularia_ (Fig. 57, _C_), produce\r\nlittle cups (_x_), circular in the first, semicircular in the second,\r\nin which special buds (_H_, _I_) are formed that fall off and produce\r\nnew plants.\r\n\r\nThe highest of the liverworts (_Jungermanniaceæ_) are, for the most\r\npart, leafy forms like _Madotheca_, and represented by a great many\r\ncommon forms, growing usually on tree trunks, etc. They are much like\r\n_Madotheca_ in general appearance, but usually very small and\r\ninconspicuous, so as to be easily overlooked, especially as their\r\ncolor is apt to be brownish, and not unlike that of the bark on which\r\nthey grow (Fig. 57, _L_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--THE TRUE MOSSES.\r\n\r\nThe true mosses (_Musci_) resemble in many respects the higher\r\nliverworts, such as _Madotheca_ or _Jungermannia_, all of them having\r\nwell-marked stems and leaves. The spore fruit is more highly\r\ndeveloped than in the liverworts, but never contains elaters.\r\n\r\nA good idea of the general structure of the higher mosses may be had\r\nfrom a study of almost any common species. One of the most convenient,\r\nas well as common, forms (_Funaria_) is to be had almost the year\r\nround, and fruits at almost all seasons, except midwinter. It grows in\r\nclose patches on the ground in fields, at the bases of walls,\r\nsometimes in the crevices between the bricks of sidewalks, etc. If\r\nfruiting, it may be recognized by the nodding capsule on a long stalk,\r\nthat is often more or less twisted, being sensitive to changes in the\r\nmoisture of the atmosphere. The plant (Fig. 58, _A_, _B_) has a short\r\nstem, thickly set with relatively large leaves. These are oblong and\r\npointed, and the centre is traversed by a delicate midrib. The base of\r\nthe stem is attached to the ground by numerous fine brown hairs.\r\n\r\nThe mature capsule is broadly oval in form (Fig. 58, _C_), and\r\nprovided with a lid that falls off when the spores are ripe. While the\r\ncapsule is young it is covered by a pointed membranous cap (_B_,\r\n_cal._) that finally falls off. When the lid is removed, a fine fringe\r\nis seen surrounding the opening of the capsule, and serving the same\r\npurpose as the elaters of the liverworts (Fig. 58, _E_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--_A_, fruiting plant of a moss (_Funaria_),\r\nwith young sporogonium (_sp._), × 4.

Sometimes the ground\r\nabout young patches of the moss is quite covered by a fine film of\r\nsuch threads, and looking carefully over it probably very small moss\r\nplants may be seen growing up here and there from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Longitudinal section through the summit of a\r\nsmall male plant of _Funaria_. _a_, _aʹ_, antheridia. _p_, paraphysis.\r\n_L_, section of a leaf, × 150.]\r\n\r\nThis moss is diœcious. The male plants are smaller than the female,\r\nand may be recognized by the bright red antheridia which are formed at\r\nthe end of the stem in considerable numbers, and surrounded by a\r\ncircle of leaves so that the whole looks something like a flower.\r\n(This is still more evident in some other mosses. See Figure 65, _E_,\r\n_F_.)\r\n\r\n  The leaves when magnified are seen to be composed of a single layer\r\n  of cells, except the midrib, which is made up of several thicknesses\r\n  of elongated cells. Where the leaf is one cell thick, the cells are\r\n  oblong in form, becoming narrower as they approach the midrib and\r\n  the margin. They contain numerous chloroplasts imbedded in the layer\r\n  of protoplasm that lines the wall. The nucleus (Fig. 63, _C_, _n_)\r\n  may usually be seen without difficulty, especially if the leaf is\r\n  treated with iodine. This plant is one of the best for studying the\r\n  division of the chloroplasts, which may usually be found in all\r\n  stages of division (Fig. 63, _D_). In the chloroplasts, especially\r\n  if the plant has been exposed to light for several hours, will be\r\n  found numerous small granules, that assume a bluish tint on the\r\n  application of iodine, showing them to be starch grains. If the\r\n  plant is kept in the dark for a day or two, these will be absent,\r\n  having been used up; but if exposed to the light again, new ones\r\n  will be formed, showing that they are formed only under the action\r\n  of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--_A_, _B_, young antheridia of _Funaria_,\r\noptical section, × 150. _C_, two sperm cells of _Atrichum_. _D_,\r\nspermatozoids of _Sphagnum_, × 600.]\r\n\r\n  Starch is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and so far as is\r\n  known is only produced by chlorophyll-bearing cells, under the\r\n  influence of light. The carbon used in the manufacture of starch is\r\n  taken from the atmosphere in the form of carbonic acid, so that\r\n  green plants serve to purify the atmosphere by the removal of this\r\n  substance, which is deleterious to animal life, while at the same\r\n  time the carbon, an essential part of all living matter, is combined\r\n  in such form as to make it available for the food of other\r\n  organisms.\r\n\r\n  The marginal cells of the leaf are narrow, and some of them\r\n  prolonged into teeth.\r\n\r\n  A cross-section of the stem (63, _E_) shows on the outside a single\r\n  row of epidermal cells, then larger chlorophyll-bearing cells, and\r\n  in the centre a group of very delicate, small, colorless cells,\r\n  which in longitudinal section are seen to be elongated, and similar\r\n  to those forming the midrib of the leaf. These cells probably serve\r\n  for conducting fluids, much as the similar but more perfectly\r\n  developed bundles of cells (fibro-vascular bundles) found in the\r\n  stems and leaves of the higher plants.\r\n\r\n  The root hairs, fastening the plant to the ground, are rows of\r\n  cells with brown walls and oblique partitions. They often merge\r\n  insensibly into the green filaments (protonema) already noticed.\r\n  These latter have usually colorless walls, and more numerous\r\n  chloroplasts, looking very much like a delicate specimen of\r\n  _Cladophora_ or some similar alga. If a sufficient number of these\r\n  filaments is examined, some of them will probably show young moss\r\n  plants growing from them (Fig. 63, _A_, _k_), and with a little\r\n  patience the leafy plant can be traced back to a little bud\r\n  originating as a branch of the filament. Its diameter is at first\r\n  scarcely greater than that of the filament, but a series of walls,\r\n  close together, are formed, so placed as to cut off a pyramidal cell\r\n  at the top, forming the apical cell of the young moss plant. This\r\n  apical cell has the form of a three-sided pyramid with the base\r\n  upward. From it are developed three series of cells, cut off in\r\n  succession from the three sides, and from these cells are derived\r\n  all the tissues of the plant which soon becomes of sufficient size\r\n  to be easily recognizable.\r\n\r\n  The protonemal filaments may be made to grow from almost any part of\r\n  the plant by keeping it moist, but grow most abundantly from the\r\n  base of the stem.\r\n\r\n  The sexual organs are much like those of the liverworts and are\r\n  borne at the apex of the stems.\r\n\r\n  The antheridia (Figs. 59, 60) are club-shaped bodies with a short\r\n  stalk. The upper part consists of a single layer of large\r\n  chlorophyll-bearing cells, enclosing a mass of very small, nearly\r\n  cubical, colorless, sperm cells each of which contains an\r\n  excessively small spermatozoid.\r\n\r\n  The young antheridium has an apical cell giving rise to two series\r\n  of segments (Fig. 60, _A_), which in the earlier stages are very\r\n  plainly marked.\r\n\r\n  When ripe the chlorophyll in the outer cells changes color, becoming\r\n  red, and if a few such antheridia from a plant that has been kept\r\n  rather dry for a day or two, are teased out in a drop of water, they\r\n  will quickly open at the apex, the whole mass of sperm cells being\r\n  discharged at once.\r\n\r\n  Among the antheridia are borne peculiar hairs (Fig. 59, _p_) tipped\r\n  by a large globular cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--_A_, _B_, young; _C_, nearly ripe archegonium\r\nof _Funaria_, optical section, × 150. _D_, upper part of the neck of\r\n_C_, seen from without, showing how it is twisted. _E_, base of a ripe\r\narchegonium. _F_, open apex of the same, × 150. _o_, egg cell. _b_,\r\nventral canal cell.]\r\n\r\n  Owing to their small size the spermatozoids are difficult to see\r\n  satisfactorily and other mosses (_e.g._ peat mosses, Figure 64, the\r\n  hairy cap moss, Figure 65, _I_), are preferable where obtainable.\r\n  The spermatozoids of a peat moss are shown in Figure 60, _D_. Like\r\n  all of the bryophytes they have but two cilia.\r\n\r\n  The archegonia (Fig. 61) should be looked for in the younger plants\r\n  in the neighborhood of those that bear capsules. Like the antheridia\r\n  they occur in groups. They closely resemble those of the liverworts,\r\n  but the neck is longer and twisted and the base more massive.\r\n  Usually but a single one of the group is fertilized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--_A_, young embryo of _Funaria_, still\r\nenclosed within the base of the archegonium, × 300. _B_, an older\r\nembryo freed from the archegonium, × 150. _a_, the apical cell.]\r\n\r\n  To study the first division of the embryo, it is usually necessary\r\n  to render the archegonium transparent, which may be done by using a\r\n  little caustic potash; or letting it lie for a few hours in dilute\r\n  glycerine will sometimes suffice. If potash is used it must be\r\n  thoroughly washed away, by drawing pure water under the cover glass\r\n  with a bit of blotting paper, until every trace of the potash is\r\n  removed. The first wall in the embryo is nearly at right angles to\r\n  the axis of the archegonium and divides the egg cell into nearly\r\n  equal parts. This is followed by nearly vertical walls in each cell\r\n  (Fig. 62, _A_). Very soon a two-sided apical cell (Fig. 62, _B_,\r\n  _a_) is formed in the upper half of the embryo, which persists until\r\n  the embryo has reached a considerable size. As in the liverworts the\r\n  young embryo is completely covered by the growing archegonium wall.\r\n\r\n  The embryo may be readily removed from the archegonium by adding a\r\n  little potash to the water in which it is lying, allowing it to\r\n  remain for a few moments and pressing gently upon the cover glass\r\n  with a needle. In this way it can be easily forced out of the\r\n  archegonium, and then by thoroughly washing away the potash,\r\n  neutralizing if necessary with a little acetic acid, very beautiful\r\n  preparations may be made. If desired, these may be mounted\r\n  permanently in glycerine which, however, must be added very\r\n  gradually to avoid shrinking the cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--_A_, protonema of _Funaria_, with a bud\r\n(_k_), × 50. _B_, outline of a leaf, showing also the thickened\r\nmidrib, × 12. _C_, cells of the leaf, × 300. _n_, nucleus. _D_,\r\nchlorophyll granules undergoing division, × 300. _E_, cross-section of\r\nthe stem, × 50.]\r\n\r\n  For some time the embryo has a nearly cylindrical form, but as it\r\n  approaches maturity the differentiation into stalk and capsule\r\n  becomes apparent. The latter increases rapidly in diameter, assuming\r\n  gradually the oval shape of the full-grown capsule. A longitudinal\r\n  section of the nearly ripe capsule (Fig. 58, _G_) shows two distinct\r\n  portions; an outer wall of two layers of cells, and an inner mass of\r\n  cells in some of which the spores are produced. This inner mass of\r\n  cells is continuous with the upper part of the capsule, but\r\n  connected with the side walls and bottom by means of slender,\r\n  branching filaments of chlorophyll-bearing cells.\r\n\r\n  The spores arise from a single layer of cells near the outside of\r\n  the inner mass of cells (_G_, _sp._). These cells (_H_, _sp._) are\r\n  filled with glistening, granular protoplasm; have a large and\r\n  distinct nucleus, and no chlorophyll. They finally become entirely\r\n  separated and each one gives rise to four spores which closely\r\n  resemble those of the liverworts but are smaller.\r\n\r\n  Near the base of the capsule, on the outside, are formed breathing\r\n  pores (Fig. 58, _F_) quite similar to those of the higher plants.\r\n\r\n  If the spores are kept in water for a few days they will germinate,\r\n  bursting the outer brown coat, and the contents protruding through\r\n  the opening surrounded by the colorless inner spore membrane. The\r\n  protuberance grows rapidly in length and soon becomes separated from\r\n  the body of the spore by a wall, and lengthening, more and more,\r\n  gives rise to a green filament like those we found attached to the\r\n  base of the full-grown plant, and like those giving rise to buds\r\n  that develop into leafy plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE MOSSES.\r\n\r\nThe mosses may be divided into four orders: I. The peat mosses\r\n(_Sphagnaceæ_); II. _Andreæaceæ_; III. _Phascaceæ_; IV. The common\r\nmosses (_Bryaceæ_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--_A_, a peat moss (_Sphagnum_), × ½. _B_, a\r\nsporogonium of the same, × 3. _C_, a portion of a leaf, × 150. The\r\nnarrow, chlorophyll-bearing cells form meshes, enclosing the large,\r\ncolorless empty cells, whose walls are marked with thickened bars, and\r\ncontain round openings (_o_).]\r\n\r\nThe peat mosses (Fig. 64) are large pale-green mosses, growing often\r\nin enormous masses, forming the foundation of peat-bogs. They are of a\r\npeculiar spongy texture, very light when dry, and capable of absorbing\r\na great amount of water. They branch (Fig. 64, _A_), the branches\r\nbeing closely crowded at the top, where the stems continue to grow,\r\ndying away below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Forms of mosses. _A_, plant of _Phascum_,\r\n× 3. _B_, fruiting plant of _Atrichum_, × 2. _C_, young capsule of\r\nhairy-cap moss (_Polytrichum_), covered by the large, hairy calyptra.\r\n_D_, capsules of _Bartramia_: i, with; ii, without the calyptra. _E_,\r\nupper part of a male plant of _Atrichum_, showing the flower, × 2.\r\n_F_, a male plant of _Mnium_, × 4. _G_, pine-tree moss (_Clemacium_),\r\n× 1. _H_, _Hypnum_, × 1. _I_, ripe capsules of hairy-cap moss: i,\r\nwith; ii, without calyptra.]\r\n\r\nThe sexual organs are rarely met with, but should be looked for late\r\nin autumn or early spring. The antheridial branches are often\r\nbright-colored, red or yellow, so as to be very conspicuous. The\r\ncapsules, which are not often found, are larger than in most of the\r\ncommon mosses, and quite destitute of a stalk, the apparent stalk\r\nbeing a prolongation of the axis of the plant in the top of which the\r\nbase of the sporogonium is imbedded. The capsule is nearly globular,\r\nopening by a lid at the top (Fig. 64, _B_).\r\n\r\n  A microscopical examination of the leaves, which are quite destitute\r\n  of a midrib, shows them to be composed of a network of narrow\r\n  chlorophyll-bearing cells surrounding much larger empty ones whose\r\n  walls are marked with transverse thickenings, and perforated here\r\n  and there with large, round holes (Fig. 64, _C_). It is to the\r\n  presence of these empty cells that the plant owes its peculiar\r\n  spongy texture, the growing plants being fairly saturated with\r\n  water.\r\n\r\nThe _Andreæaceæ_ are very small, and not at all common. The capsule\r\nsplits into four valves, something like a liverwort.\r\n\r\nThe _Phascaceæ_ are small mosses growing on the ground or low down on\r\nthe trunks of trees, etc. They differ principally from the common\r\nmosses in having the capsule open irregularly and not by a lid. The\r\ncommonest forms belong to the genus _Phascum_ (Fig. 65, _A_).\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the mosses the student is likely to meet with\r\nbelong to the last order, and agree in the main with the one\r\ndescribed. Some of the commoner forms are shown in Figure 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM V.\r\n\r\nPTERIDOPHYTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we compare the structure of the sporogonium of a moss or liverwort\r\nwith the plant bearing the sexual organs, we find that its tissues are\r\nbetter differentiated, and that it is on the whole a more complex\r\nstructure than the plant that bears it. It, however, remains attached\r\nto the parent plant, deriving its nourishment in part through the\r\n\"foot\" by means of which it is attached to the plant.\r\n\r\nIn the Pteridophytes, however, we find that the sporogonium becomes\r\nvery much more developed, and finally becomes entirely detached from\r\nthe sexual plant, developing in most cases roots that fasten it to the\r\nground, after which it may live for many years, and reach a very large\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe sexual plant, which is here called the \"prothallium,\" is of very\r\nsimple structure, resembling the lower liverworts usually, and never\r\nreaches more than about a centimetre in diameter, and is often much\r\nsmaller than this.\r\n\r\nThe common ferns are the types of the sub-kingdom, and a careful study\r\nof any of these will illustrate the principal peculiarities of the\r\ngroup. The whole plant, as we know it, is really nothing but the\r\nsporogonium, originating from the egg cell in exactly the same way as\r\nthe moss sporogonium, and like it gives rise to spores which are\r\nformed upon the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe spores may be collected by placing the spore-bearing leaves on\r\nsheets of paper and letting them dry, when the ripe spores will be\r\ndischarged covering the paper as a fine, brown powder. If these are\r\nsown on fine, rather closely packed earth, and kept moist and covered\r\nwith glass so as to prevent evaporation, within a week or two a fine,\r\ngreen, moss-like growth will make its appearance, and by the end of\r\nfive or six weeks, if the weather is warm, little, flat, heart-shaped\r\nplants of a dark-green color may be seen. These look like small\r\nliverworts, and are the sexual plants (prothallia) of our ferns\r\n(Fig. 66, _F_). Removing one of these carefully, we find on the lower\r\nside numerous fine hairs like those on the lower surface of the\r\nliverworts, which fasten it firmly to the ground. By and by, if our\r\nculture has been successful, we may find attached to some of the\r\nlarger of these, little fern plants growing from the under side of the\r\nprothallia, and attached to the ground by a delicate root. As the\r\nlittle plant becomes larger the prothallium dies, leaving it attached\r\nto the ground as an independent plant, which after a time bears the\r\nspores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--_A_, spore of the ostrich fern (_Onoclea_),\r\nwith the outer coat removed. _B_, germinating spore, × 150. _C_, young\r\nprothallium, × 50. _r_, root hair. _sp._ spore membrane. _D_, _E_,\r\nolder prothallia. _a_, apical cell, × 150. _F_, a female prothallium,\r\nseen from below, × 12. _ar._ archegonia. _G_, _H_, young archegonia,\r\nin optical section, × 150. _o_, central cell. _b_, ventral canal cell.\r\n_c_, upper canal cell. _I_, a ripe archegonium in the act of opening,\r\n× 150. _o_, egg cell. _J_, a male prothallium, × 50. _an._ antheridia.\r\n_K_, _L_, young antheridia, in optical section, × 300. _M_, ripe\r\nantheridium, × 300. _sp._ sperm cells. _N_, _O_, antheridia that have\r\npartially discharged their contents, × 300. _P_, spermatozoids, killed\r\nwith iodine, × 500. _v_, vesicle attached to the hinder end.]\r\n\r\nIn choosing spores for germination it is best to select those of large\r\nsize and containing abundant chlorophyll, as they germinate more\r\nreadily. Especially favorable for this purpose are the spores of the\r\nostrich fern (_Onoclea struthiopteris_) (Fig. 70, _I_, _J_), or the\r\nsensitive fern (_O. sensibilis_). Another common and readily grown\r\nspecies is the lady fern (_Asplenium filixfœmina_) (Fig. 70, _H_). The\r\nspores of most ferns retain their vitality for many months, and hence\r\ncan be kept dry until wanted.\r\n\r\n  The first stages of germination may be readily seen by sowing the\r\n  spores in water, where, under favorable circumstances, they will\r\n  begin to grow within three or four days. The outer, dry, brown coat\r\n  of the spore is first ruptured, and often completely thrown off by\r\n  the swelling of the spore contents. Below this is a second colorless\r\n  membrane which is also ruptured, but remains attached to the spore.\r\n  Through the orifice in the second coat, the inner delicate membrane\r\n  protrudes in the form of a nearly colorless papilla which rapidly\r\n  elongates and becomes separated from the body of the spore by a\r\n  partition, constituting the first root hair (Fig. 66, _B_, _C_,\r\n  _r_). The body of the spore containing most of the chlorophyll\r\n  elongates more slowly, and divides by a series of transverse walls\r\n  so as to form a short row of cells, resembling in structure some of\r\n  the simpler algæ (_C_).\r\n\r\n  In order to follow the development further, spores must be sown upon\r\n  earth, as they do not develop normally in water beyond this stage.\r\n\r\n  In studying plants grown on earth, they should be carefully removed\r\n  and washed in a drop of water so as to remove, as far as possible,\r\n  any adherent particles, and then may be mounted in water for\r\n  microscopic examination.\r\n\r\n  In most cases, after three or four cross-walls are formed, two walls\r\n  arise in the end cell so inclined as to enclose a wedge-shaped cell\r\n  (_a_) from which are cut off two series of segments by walls\r\n  directed alternately right and left (Fig. 66, _D_, _E_, _a_), the\r\n  apical cell growing to its original dimensions after each pair of\r\n  segments is cut off. The segments divide by vertical walls in\r\n  various directions so that the young plant rapidly assumes the form\r\n  of a flat plate of cells attached to the ground by root hairs\r\n  developed from the lower surfaces of the cells, and sometimes from\r\n  the marginal ones. As the division walls are all vertical, the plant\r\n  is nowhere more than one cell thick. The marginal cells of the young\r\n  segments divide more rapidly than the inner ones, and soon project\r\n  beyond the apical cell which thus comes to lie at the bottom of a\r\n  cleft in the front of the plant which in consequence becomes\r\n  heart-shaped (_E_, _F_). Sooner or later the apical cell ceases to\r\n  form regular segments and becomes indistinguishable from the other\r\n  cells.\r\n\r\n  In the ostrich fern and lady fern the plants are diœcious. The male\r\n  plants (Fig. 66, _J_) are very small, often barely visible to the\r\n  naked eye, and when growing thickly form dense, moss-like patches.\r\n  They are variable in form, some irregularly shaped, others simple\r\n  rows of cells, and some have the heart shape of the larger plants.\r\n\r\nThe female plants (Fig. 66, _F_) are always comparatively large and\r\nregularly heart-shaped, occasionally reaching a diameter of nearly or\r\nquite one centimetre, so that they are easily recognizable without\r\nmicroscopical examination.\r\n\r\n  All the cells of the plant except the root hairs contain large and\r\n  distinct chloroplasts much like those in the leaves of the moss, and\r\n  like them usually to be found in process of division.\r\n\r\n  The archegonia arise from cells of the lower surface, just behind\r\n  the notch in front (Fig. 66, _F_, _ar._). Previous to their\r\n  formation the cells at this point divide by walls parallel to the\r\n  surface of the plant, so as to form several layers of cells, and\r\n  from the lowest layer of cells the archegonia arise. They resemble\r\n  those of the liverworts but are shorter, and the lower part is\r\n  completely sunk within the tissues of the plant (Fig. 66, _G_, _I_).\r\n  They arise as single surface cells, this first dividing into three\r\n  by walls parallel to the outer surface. The lower cell undergoes one\r\n  or two divisions, but undergoes no further change; the second cell\r\n  (_C_, _o_), becomes the egg cell, and from it is cut off another\r\n  cell (_c_), the canal cell of the neck; the uppermost of the three\r\n  becomes the neck. There are four rows of neck cells, the two forward\r\n  ones being longer than the others, so that the neck is bent\r\n  backward. In the full-grown archegonium, there are two canal cells,\r\n  the lower one (_H_, _b_) called the ventral canal cell, being\r\n  smaller than the other.\r\n\r\n  Shortly before the archegonium opens, the canal cells become\r\n  disorganized in the same way as in the bryophytes, and the\r\n  protoplasm of the central cell contracts to form the egg cell which\r\n  shows a large, central nucleus, and in favorable cases, a clear\r\n  space at the top called the \"receptive spot,\" as it is here that the\r\n  spermatozoid enters. When ripe, if placed in water, the neck cells\r\n  become very much distended and finally open widely at the top, the\r\n  upper ones not infrequently being detached, and the remains of the\r\n  neck cells are forced out (Fig. 66, _I_).\r\n\r\n  The antheridia (Fig. 66. _J_, _M_) arise as simple hemispherical\r\n  cells, in which two walls are formed (_K_ I, II), the lower\r\n  funnel-shaped, the upper hemispherical and meeting the lower one so\r\n  as to enclose a central cell (shaded in the figure), from which the\r\n  sperm cells arise. Finally, a ring-shaped wall (_L_ iii) is formed,\r\n  cutting off a sort of cap cell, so that the antheridium at this\r\n  stage consists of a central cell, surrounded by three other cells,\r\n  the two lower ring-shaped, the upper disc-shaped. The central cell,\r\n  which contains dense, glistening protoplasm, is destitute of\r\n  chlorophyll, but the outer cells have a few small chloroplasts. The\r\n  former divides repeatedly, until a mass of about thirty-two sperm\r\n  cells is formed, each giving rise to a large spirally-coiled\r\n  spermatozoid. When ripe, the mass of sperm cells crowds so upon the\r\n  outer cells as to render them almost invisible, and as they ripen\r\n  they separate by a partial dissolving of the division walls. When\r\n  brought into water, the outer cells of the antheridium swell\r\n  strongly, and the matter derived from the dissolved walls of the\r\n  sperm cells also absorbs water, so that finally the pressure becomes\r\n  so great that the wall of the antheridium breaks, and the sperm\r\n  cells are forced out by the swelling up of the wall cells (_N_,\r\n  _O_). After lying a few moments in the water, the wall of each sperm\r\n  cell becomes completely dissolved, and the spermatozoids are\r\n  released, and swim rapidly away with a twisting movement. They may\r\n  be killed with a little iodine, when each is seen to be a somewhat\r\n  flattened band, coiled several times. At the forward end, the coils\r\n  are smaller, and there are numerous very long and delicate cilia. At\r\n  the hinder end may generally be seen a delicate sac (_P_, _v_),\r\n  containing a few small granules, some of which usually show the\r\n  reaction of starch, turning blue when iodine is applied.\r\n\r\n  In studying the development of the antheridia, it is only necessary\r\n  to mount the plants in water and examine them directly; but the\r\n  study of the archegonia requires careful longitudinal sections of\r\n  the prothallium. To make these, the prothallium should be placed\r\n  between small pieces of pith, and the razor must be very sharp. It\r\n  may be necessary to use a little potash to make the sections\r\n  transparent enough to see the structure, but this must be used\r\n  cautiously on account of the great delicacy of the tissues.\r\n\r\n  If a plant with ripe archegonia is placed in a drop of water, with\r\n  the lower surface uppermost, and at the same time male plants are\r\n  put with it, and the whole covered with a cover glass, the\r\n  archegonia and antheridia will open simultaneously; and, if examined\r\n  with the microscope, we shall see the spermatozoids collect about\r\n  the open archegonia, to which they are attracted by the substance\r\n  forced out when it opens. With a little patience, one or more may be\r\n  seen to enter the open neck through which it forces itself, by a\r\n  slow twisting movement, down to the egg cell. In order to make the\r\n  experiment successful, the plants should be allowed to become a\r\n  little dry, care being taken that no water is poured over them for a\r\n  day or two beforehand.\r\n\r\n  The first divisions of the fertilized egg cell resemble those in the\r\n  moss embryo, except that the first wall is parallel with the\r\n  archegonium axis, instead of at right angles to it. Very soon,\r\n  however, the embryo becomes very different, four growing points\r\n  being established instead of the single one found in the moss\r\n  embryo. The two growing points on the side of the embryo nearest the\r\n  archegonium neck grow faster than the others, one of these\r\n  outstripping the other, and soon becoming recognizable as the first\r\n  leaf of the embryo (Fig. 67, _A_, _L_). The other (_r_) is peculiar,\r\n  in having its growing point covered by several layers of cells, cut\r\n  off from its outer face, a peculiarity which we shall find is\r\n  characteristic of the roots of all the higher plants, and, indeed,\r\n  this is the first root of the young fern. Of the other two growing\r\n  points, the one next the leaf grows slowly, forming a blunt cone\r\n  (_st._), and is the apex of the stem. The other (_f_) has no\r\n  definite form, and serves merely as an organ of absorption, by means\r\n  of which nourishment is supplied to the embryo from the prothallium;\r\n  it is known as the foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--_A_, embryo of the ostrich fern just before\r\nbreaking through the prothallium, × 50. _st._ apex of stem. _l_, first\r\nleaf. _r_, first root. _ar._ neck of the archegonium. _B_, young\r\nplant, still attached to the prothallium (_pr._). _C_, underground\r\nstem of the maiden-hair fern (_Adiantum_), with one young leaf, and\r\nthe base of an older one, × 1. _D_, three cross-sections of a leaf\r\nstalk: i, nearest the base; iii, nearest the blade of the leaf,\r\nshowing the division of the fibro-vascular bundle, × 5. _E_, part of\r\nthe blade of the leaf, × ½. _F_, a single spore-bearing leaflet,\r\nshowing the edge folded over to cover the sporangia, × 1. _G_, part of\r\nthe fibro-vascular bundle of the leaf stalk (cross-section), × 50.\r\n_x_, woody part of the bundle. _y_, bast. _sh._ bundle sheath. _H_, a\r\nsmall portion of the same bundle, × 150. _I_, stony tissue from the\r\nunderground stem, × 150. _J_, sieve tube from the underground stem,\r\n× 300.]\r\n\r\n  Up to this point, all the cells of the embryo are much alike, and\r\n  the embryo, like that of the bryophytes, is completely surrounded by\r\n  the enlarged base of the archegonium (compare Fig. 67, _A_, with\r\n  Fig. 55); but before the embryo breaks through the overlying cells a\r\n  differentiation of the tissues begins. In the axis of each of the\r\n  four divisions the cells divide lengthwise so as to form a\r\n  cylindrical mass of narrow cells, not unlike those in the stem of a\r\n  moss. Here, however, some of the cells undergo a further change; the\r\n  walls thicken in places, and the cells lose their contents, forming\r\n  a peculiar conducting tissue (tracheary tissue), found only in the\r\n  two highest sub-kingdoms. The whole central cylinder is called a\r\n  \"fibro-vascular bundle,\" and in its perfect form, at least, is found\r\n  in no plants below the ferns, which are also the first to develop\r\n  true roots.\r\n\r\nThe young root and leaf now rapidly elongate, and burst through the\r\noverlying cells, the former growing downward and becoming fastened in\r\nthe ground, the latter growing upward through the notch in the front\r\nof the prothallium, and increasing rapidly in size (Fig. 67, _B_). The\r\nleaf is more or less deeply cleft, and traversed by veins which are\r\ncontinuations of the fibro-vascular bundle of the stalk, and\r\nthemselves fork once or twice. The surface of the leaf is covered with\r\na well-developed epidermis, and the cells occupying the space between\r\nthe veins contain numerous chloroplasts, so that the little plant is\r\nnow quite independent of the prothallium, which has hitherto supported\r\nit. As soon as the fern is firmly established, the prothallium withers\r\naway.\r\n\r\nComparing this now with the development of the sporogonium in the\r\nbryophytes, it is evident that the young fern is the equivalent of the\r\nsporogonium or spore fruit of the former, being, like it, the direct\r\nproduct of the fertilized egg cell; and the prothallium represents the\r\nmoss or liverwort, upon which are borne the sexual organs. In the\r\nfern, however, the sporogonium becomes entirely independent of the\r\nsexual plant, and does not produce spores until it has reached a large\r\nsize, living many years. The sexual stage, on the other hand, is very\r\nmuch reduced, as we have seen, being so small as to be ordinarily\r\ncompletely overlooked; but its resemblance to the lower liverworts,\r\nlike _Riccia_, or the horned liverworts, is obvious. The terms\r\noöphyte (egg-bearing plant) and sporophyte (spore-bearing plant, or\r\nsporogonium) are sometimes used to distinguish between the sexual\r\nplant and the spore-bearing one produced from it.\r\n\r\nThe common maiden-hair fern (_Adiantum pedatum_) has been selected\r\nhere for studying the structure of the full-grown sporophyte, but\r\nalmost any other common fern will answer. The maiden-hair fern is\r\ncommon in rich woods, and may be at once recognized by the form of its\r\nleaves. These arise from a creeping, underground stem (Fig. 67, _C_),\r\nwhich is covered with brownish scales, and each leaf consists of a\r\nslender stalk, reddish brown or nearly black in color, which divides\r\ninto two equal branches at the top. Each of these main branches bears\r\na row of smaller ones on the outside, and these have a row of delicate\r\nleaflets on each side (Fig. 67, _E_). The stem of the plant is\r\nfastened to the ground by means of numerous stout roots. The youngest\r\nof these, near the growing point of the stem, are unbranched, but the\r\nolder ones branch extensively (_C_).\r\n\r\nOn breaking the stem across, it is seen to be dark-colored, except in\r\nthe centre, which is traversed by a woody cylinder (fibro-vascular\r\nbundle) of a lighter color. This is sometimes circular in sections,\r\nsometimes horse-shoe shaped. Where the stem branches, the bundle of\r\nthe branch may be traced back to where it joins that of the main stem.\r\n\r\n  A thin cross-section of the stem shows, when magnified, three\r\n  regions. First, an outer row of cells, often absent in the older\r\n  portions; this is the epidermis. Second, within the epidermis are\r\n  several rows of cells similar to the epidermal cells, but somewhat\r\n  larger, and like them having dark-brown walls. These merge gradually\r\n  into larger cells, with thicker golden brown walls (Fig. 67, _I_).\r\n  The latter, if sufficiently magnified, show distinct striation of\r\n  the walls, which are often penetrated by deep narrow depressions or\r\n  \"pits.\" This thick-walled tissue is called \"stony tissue\"\r\n  (schlerenchyma). All the cells contain numerous granules, which the\r\n  iodine test shows to be starch. All of this second region lying\r\n  between the epidermis and the fibro-vascular bundle is known as the\r\n  ground tissue. The third region (fibro-vascular) is, as we have seen\r\n  without the microscope, circular or horse-shoe shaped. It is sharply\r\n  separated from the ground tissue by a row of small cells, called the\r\n  \"bundle sheath.\" The cross-section of the bundle of the leaf stalk\r\n  resembles, almost exactly, that of the stem; and, as it is much\r\n  easier to cut, it is to be preferred in studying the arrangement of\r\n  the tissues of the bundle (Fig. 67, _G_). Within the bundle sheath\r\n  (_sh._) there are two well-marked regions, a central band (_x_) of\r\n  large empty cells, with somewhat angular outlines, and distinctly\r\n  separated walls; and an outer portion (_y_) filling up the space\r\n  between these central cells and the bundle sheath. The central\r\n  tissue (_x_) is called the woody tissue (xylem); the outer, the bast\r\n  (phloem). The latter is composed of smaller cells of variable form,\r\n  and with softer walls than the wood cells.\r\n\r\n  A longitudinal section of either the stem or leaf stalk shows that\r\n  all the cells are decidedly elongated, especially those of the\r\n  fibro-vascular bundle. The xylem (Fig. 68, _C_, _x_) is made up\r\n  principally of large empty cells, with pointed ends, whose walls are\r\n  marked with closely set, narrow, transverse pits, giving them the\r\n  appearance of little ladders, whence they are called \"scalariform,\"\r\n  or ladder-shaped markings. These empty cells are known as\r\n  \"tracheids,\" and tissue composed of such empty cells, \"tracheary\r\n  tissue.\" Besides the tracheids, there are a few small cells with\r\n  oblique ends, and with some granular contents.\r\n\r\n  The phloem is composed of cells similar to the latter, but there may\r\n  also be found, especially in the stem, other larger ones (Fig. 67,\r\n  _J_), whose walls are marked with shallow depressions, whose bottoms\r\n  are finely pitted. These are the so-called \"sieve tubes.\"\r\n\r\n  For microscopical examination, either fresh or alcoholic material\r\n  may be used, the sections being mounted in water. Potash will be\r\n  found useful in rendering opaque sections transparent.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, when young, are coiled up (Fig. 67, _C_), owing to growth\r\nin the earlier stages being greater on the lower than on the upper\r\nside. As the leaf unfolds, the stalk straightens, and the upper\r\nportion (blade) becomes flat.\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the leaf stalk may be understood by making a\r\nseries of cross-sections at different heights, and examining them with\r\na hand lens. The arrangement is essentially the same as in the stem.\r\nThe epidermis and immediately underlying ground tissue are\r\ndark-colored, but the inner ground tissue is light-colored, and much\r\nsofter than the corresponding part of the stem; and some of the outer\r\ncells show a greenish color, due to the presence of chlorophyll.\r\n\r\nThe section of the fibro-vascular bundle differs at different heights.\r\nNear the base of the stalk (Fig. _D_ i) it is horseshoe-shaped; but,\r\nif examined higher up, it is found to divide (II, III), one part going\r\nto each of the main branches of the leaf. These secondary bundles\r\ndivide further, forming the veins of the leaflets.\r\n\r\nThe leaflets (_E_, _F_) are one-sided, the principal vein running\r\nclose to the lower edge, and the others branching from it, and forking\r\nas they approach the upper margin, which is deeply lobed, the lobes\r\nbeing again divided into teeth. The leaflets are very thin and\r\ndelicate, with extremely smooth surface, which sheds water perfectly.\r\nIf the plant is a large one, some of the leaves will probably bear\r\nspores. The spore-bearing leaves are at once distinguished by having\r\nthe middle of each lobe of the leaflets folded over upon the lower\r\nside (_F_). On lifting one of these flaps, numerous little rounded\r\nbodies (spore cases) are seen, whitish when young, but becoming brown\r\nas they ripen. If a leaf with ripe spore cases is placed upon a piece\r\nof paper, as it dries the spores are discharged, covering the paper\r\nwith the spores, which look like fine brown powder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--_A_, vertical section of the leaf of the\r\nmaiden-hair fern, which has cut across a vein (_f.b._), × 150. _B_,\r\nsurface view of the epidermis from the lower surface of a leaf. _f_,\r\nvein. _p_, breathing pore, × 150. _C_, longitudinal section of the\r\nfibro-vascular bundle of the leaf stalk, showing tracheids with\r\nladder-shaped markings, × 150. _D_, longitudinal section through the\r\ntip of a root, × 150. _a_, apical cell. _Pl._ young fibro-vascular\r\nbundle. _Pb._ young ground tissue. _E_, cross-section of the root,\r\nthrough the region of the apical cell (_a_), × 150. _F_, cross-section\r\nthrough a full-grown root, × 25. _r_, root hairs. _G_, the\r\nfibro-vascular bundle of the same, × 150.]\r\n\r\n  A microscopical examination of the leaf stalk shows the tissues to\r\n  be almost exactly like those of the stem, except the inner ground\r\n  tissue, whose cells are thin-walled and colorless (soft tissue or\r\n  \"parenchyma\") instead of stony tissue. The structure of the blade of\r\n  the leaf, however, shows a number of peculiarities. Stripping off a\r\n  little of the epidermis with a needle, or shaving off a thin slice\r\n  with a razor, it may be examined in water, removing the air if\r\n  necessary with alcohol. It is composed of a single layer of cells,\r\n  of very irregular outline, except where it overlies a vein (Fig. 68,\r\n  _B_, _f_). Here the cells are long and narrow, with heavy walls. The\r\n  epidermal cells contain numerous chloroplasts, and on the under\r\n  surface of the leaf breathing pores (_stomata_, sing. _stoma_), not\r\n  unlike those on the capsules of some of the bryophytes. Each\r\n  breathing pore consists of two special crescent-shaped epidermal\r\n  cells (guard cells), enclosing a central opening or pore\r\n  communicating with an air space below. They arise from cells of the\r\n  young epidermis that divide by a longitudinal wall, that separates\r\n  in the middle, leaving the space between.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--_A_, mother cell of the sporangium of the\r\nmaiden-hair fern, × 300. _B_, young sporangium, surface view, × 150:\r\ni, from the side; ii, from above. _C-E_, successive stages in the\r\ndevelopment of the sporangium seen in optical section, × 150. _F_,\r\nnearly ripe sporangium, × 50: i, from in front; ii, from the side.\r\n_an._ ring. _st._ point of opening. _G_, group of four spores, × 150.\r\n_H_, a single spore, × 300.]\r\n\r\n  By holding a leaflet between two pieces of pith, and using a very\r\n  sharp razor, cross-sections can be made. Such a section is shown in\r\n  Fig. 68, _A_. The epidermis (_e_) bounds the upper and lower\r\n  surfaces, and if a vein (_f.b._) is cut across its structure is\r\n  found to be like that of the fibro-vascular bundle of the leaf\r\n  stalk, but much simplified.\r\n\r\n  The ground tissue of the leaf is composed of very loose, thin-walled\r\n  cells, containing numerous chloroplasts. Between them are large and\r\n  numerous intercellular spaces, filled with air, and communicating\r\n  with the breathing pores. These are the principal assimilating cells\r\n  of the plant; _i.e._ they are principally concerned in the\r\n  absorption and decomposition of carbonic acid from the atmosphere,\r\n  and the manufacture of starch.\r\n\r\n  The spore cases, or sporangia (Fig. 69), are at first little papillæ\r\n  (_A_), arising from the epidermal cells, from which they are early\r\n  cut off by a cross-wall. In the upper cell several walls next arise,\r\n  forming a short stalk, composed of three rows of cells, and an upper\r\n  nearly spherical cell--the sporangium proper. The latter now divides\r\n  by four walls (_B_, _C_, i-iv), into a central tetrahedral cell, and\r\n  four outer ones. The central cell, whose contents are much denser\r\n  than the outer ones, divides again by walls parallel to those first\r\n  formed, so that the young sporangium now consists of a central cell,\r\n  surrounded by two outer layers of cells. From the central cell a\r\n  group of cells is formed by further divisions (_D_), which finally\r\n  become entirely separated from each other. The outer cells of the\r\n  spore case divide only by walls, at right angles to their outer\r\n  surface, so that the wall is never more than two cells thick. Later,\r\n  the inner of these two layers becomes disorganized, so that the\r\n  central mass of cells floats free in the cavity of the sporangium,\r\n  which is now surrounded by but a single layer of cells (_E_).\r\n\r\n  Each of the central cells divides into four spores, precisely as in\r\n  the bryophytes. The young spores (_G_, _H_) are nearly colorless and\r\n  are tetrahedral (like a three-sided pyramid) in form. As they ripen,\r\n  chlorophyll is formed in them, and some oil. The wall becomes\r\n  differentiated into three layers, the outer opaque and brown, the\r\n  two inner more delicate and colorless.\r\n\r\n  Running around the outside of the ripe spore case is a single row of\r\n  cells (_an._), differing from the others in shape, and having their\r\n  inner walls thickened. Near the bottom, two (sometimes four) of\r\n  these cells are wider than the others, and their walls are more\r\n  strongly thickened. It is at this place (_st._) that the spore case\r\n  opens. When the ripe sporangium becomes dry, the ring of thickened\r\n  cells (_an._) contracts more strongly than the others, and acts like\r\n  a spring pulling the sporangium open and shaking out the spores,\r\n  which germinate readily under favorable conditions, and form after a\r\n  time the sexual plants (prothallia).\r\n\r\nThe roots of the sporophyte arise in large numbers, the youngest being\r\nalways nearest the growing point of the stem or larger roots (Fig. 67,\r\n_C_). The growing roots are pointed at the end which is also\r\nlight-colored, the older parts becoming dark brown. A cross-section of\r\nthe older portions shows a dark-brown ground tissue with a central,\r\nlight-colored, circular, fibro-vascular bundle (Fig. 68, _F_). Growing\r\nfrom its outer surface are numerous brown root hairs (_r_).\r\n\r\n  When magnified the walls of all the outer cells (epidermis and\r\n  ground tissue) are found to be dark-colored but not very thick, and\r\n  the cells are usually filled with starch. There is a bundle sheath\r\n  of much-flattened cells separating the fibro-vascular bundle from\r\n  the ground tissue. The bundle (Fig. 68, _G_) shows a band of\r\n  tracheary tissue in the centre surrounded by colorless cells, all\r\n  about alike.\r\n\r\n  All of the organs of the fern grow from a definite apical cell, but\r\n  it is difficult to study except in the root.\r\n\r\n  Selecting a fresh, pretty large root, a series of thin longitudinal\r\n  sections should be made either holding the root directly in the\r\n  fingers or placing it between pieces of pith. In order to avoid\r\n  drying of the sections, as is indeed true in cutting any delicate\r\n  tissue, it is a good plan to wet the blade of the razor. If the\r\n  section has passed through the apex, it will show the structure\r\n  shown in Figure 68, _D_. The apical cell (_a_) is large and\r\n  distinct, irregularly triangular in outline. It is really a\r\n  triangular pyramid (tetrahedron) with the base upward, which is\r\n  shown by making a series of cross-sections through the root tip, and\r\n  comparing them with the longitudinal sections. The cross-section of\r\n  the apical cell (Fig. _L_) appears also triangular, showing all its\r\n  faces to be triangles. Regular series of segments are cut off in\r\n  succession from each of the four faces of the apical cell. These\r\n  segments undergo regular divisions also, so that very early a\r\n  differentiation of the tissues is evident, and the three tissue\r\n  systems (epidermal, ground, and fibro-vascular) may be traced\r\n  almost to the apex of the root (68, _D_). From the outer series of\r\n  segments is derived the peculiar structure (root cap) covering the\r\n  delicate growing point and protecting it from injury.\r\n\r\n  The apices of the stem and leaves, being otherwise protected,\r\n  develop segments only from the sides of the apical cell, the outer\r\n  face never having segments cut off from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE PTERIDOPHYTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three well-marked classes of the Pteridophytes: the ferns\r\n(_Filicinæ_); horse-tails (_Equisetinæ_); and the club mosses\r\n(_Lycopodinæ_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--FERNS (_Filicinæ_).\r\n\r\nThe ferns constitute by far the greater number of pteridophytes, and\r\ntheir general structure corresponds with that of the maiden-hair fern\r\ndescribed. There are three orders, of which two, the true ferns\r\n(_Filices_) and the adder-tongues (_Ophioglossaceæ_), are represented\r\nin the United States. A third order, intermediate in some respects\r\nbetween these two, and called the ringless ferns (_Marattiaceæ_), has\r\nno representatives within our territory.\r\n\r\nThe classification is at present based largely upon the characters of\r\nthe sporophyte, the sexual plants being still very imperfectly known\r\nin many forms.\r\n\r\nThe adder-tongues (_Ophioglossaceæ_) are mostly plants of rather small\r\nsize, ranging from about ten to fifty centimetres in height. There are\r\ntwo genera in the United States, the true adder-tongues\r\n(_Ophioglossum_) and the grape ferns (_Botrychium_). They send up but\r\none leaf each year, and this in fruiting specimens (Fig. 70, _A_) is\r\ndivided into two portions, the spore bearing (_x_) and the green\r\nvegetative part. In _Botrychium_ the leaves are more or less deeply\r\ndivided, and the sporangia distinct (Fig. 71, _B_). In _Ophioglossum_\r\nthe sterile division of the leaf is usually smooth and undivided, and\r\nthe spore-bearing division forms a sort of spike, and the sporangia\r\nare much less distinct. The sporangia in both differ essentially from\r\nthose of the true ferns in not being derived from a single epidermal\r\ncell, but are developed in part from the ground tissue of the leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Forms of ferns. _A_, grape fern\r\n(_Botrychium_), × ½. _x_, fertile part of the leaf. _B_, sporangia of\r\n_Botrychium_, × 3. _C_, flowering fern (_Osmunda_). _x_, spore-bearing\r\nleaflets, × ½. _D_, a sporangium of _Osmunda_, × 25. _r_, ring. _E_,\r\n_Polypodium_, × 1. _F_, brake (_Pteris_), × 1. _G_, shield fern\r\n(_Aspidium_), × 2. _H_, spleen-wort (_Asplenium_), × 2. _I_, ostrich\r\nfern (_Onoclea_), × 1. _J_, the same, with the incurved edges of the\r\nleaflet partially raised so as to show the masses of sporangia\r\nbeneath, × 2.]\r\n\r\nIn the true ferns (_Filices_), the sporangia resemble those already\r\ndescribed, arising in all (unless possibly _Osmunda_) from a single\r\nepidermal cell.\r\n\r\nOne group, the water ferns (_Rhizocarpeæ_), produce two kinds of\r\nspores, large and small. The former produce male, the latter female\r\nprothallia. In both cases the prothallium is small, and often scarcely\r\nprotrudes beyond the spore, and may be reduced to a single archegonium\r\nor antheridium (Fig. 71, _B_, _C_) with only one or two cells\r\nrepresenting the vegetative cells of the prothallium (_v_). The water\r\nferns are all aquatic or semi-aquatic plants, few in number and scarce\r\nor local in their distribution. The commonest are those of the genus\r\n_Marsilia_ (Fig. 71, _A_), looking like a four-leaved clover. Others\r\n(_Salvinia_, _Azolla_) are floating forms (Fig. 71, _D_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--_A_, _Marsilia_, one of the _Rhizocarpeæ_\r\n(after Underwood). _sp._ the \"fruits\" containing the sporangia. _B_, a\r\nsmall spore of _Pilularia_, with the ripe antheridium protruding,\r\n× 180. _C_, male prothallium removed from the spore, × 180. _D_,\r\n_Azolla_ (after Sprague), × 1.]\r\n\r\nOf the true ferns there are a number of families distinguished mainly\r\nby the position of the sporangia, as well as by some differences in\r\ntheir structure. Of our common ferns, those differing most widely from\r\nthe types are the flowering ferns (_Osmunda_), shown in Figure 70,\r\n_C_, _D_. In these the sporangia are large and the ring (_r_)\r\nrudimentary. The leaflets bearing the sporangia are more or less\r\ncontracted and covered completely with the sporangia, sometimes all\r\nthe leaflets of the spore-bearing leaf being thus changed, sometimes\r\nonly a few of them, as in the species figured.\r\n\r\nOur other common ferns have the sporangia in groups (_sori_, sing.\r\n_sorus_) on the backs of the leaves. These sori are of different shape\r\nin different genera, and are usually protected by a delicate\r\nmembranous covering (indusium). Illustrations of some of the commonest\r\ngenera are shown in Figure 70, _E_, _J_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--HORSE-TAILS (_Equisetinæ_).\r\n\r\nThe second class of the pteridophytes includes the horse-tails\r\n(_Equisetinæ_) of which all living forms belong to a single genus\r\n(_Equisetum_). Formerly they were much more numerous than at present,\r\nremains of many different forms being especially abundant in the coal\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--_A_, spore-bearing stem of the field\r\nhorse-tail (_Equisetum_), × 1. _x_, the spore-bearing cone. _B_,\r\nsterile stem of the same, × ½. _C_, underground stem, with tubers\r\n(_o_), × ½. _D_, cross-section of an aerial stem, × 5. _f.b._\r\nfibro-vascular bundle. _E_, a single fibro-vascular bundle, × 150.\r\n_tr._ vessels. _F_, a single leaf from the cone, × 5. _G_, the same\r\ncut lengthwise, through a spore sac (_sp._), × 5. _H_, a spore, × 50.\r\n_I_, the same, moistened so that the elaters are coiled up, × 150.\r\n_J_, a male prothallium, × 50. _an._ an antheridium. _K_,\r\nspermatozoids, × 300.]\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest forms is the field horse-tail (_Equisetum\r\narvense_), a very abundant and widely distributed species. It grows in\r\nlow, moist ground, and is often found in great abundance growing in\r\nthe sand or gravel used as \"ballast\" for railway tracks.\r\n\r\nThe plant sends up branches of two kinds from a creeping underground\r\nstem that may reach a length of a metre or more. This stem (Fig. 72,\r\n_C_) is distinctly jointed, bearing at each joint a toothed sheath,\r\nbest seen in the younger portions, as they are apt to be destroyed in\r\nthe older parts. Sometimes attached to this are small tubers (_o_)\r\nwhich are much-shortened branches and under favorable circumstances\r\ngive rise to new stems. They have a hard, brown rind, and are composed\r\nwithin mainly of a firm, white tissue, filled with starch.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the stem is marked with furrows, and a section across\r\nit shows that corresponding to these are as many large air spaces that\r\ntraverse the stem from joint to joint. From the joints numerous roots,\r\nquite like those of the ferns, arise.\r\n\r\nIf the stem is dug up in the late fall or winter, numerous short\r\nbranches of a lighter color will be found growing from the joints.\r\nThese later grow up above ground into branches of two sorts. Those\r\nproduced first (Fig. 72, _A_), in April or May, are stouter than the\r\nothers, and nearly destitute of chlorophyll. They are usually twenty\r\nto thirty centimetres in height, of a light reddish brown color, and,\r\nlike all the stems, distinctly jointed. The sheaths about the joints\r\n(_L_) are much larger than in the others, and have from ten to twelve\r\nlarge black teeth at the top. These sheaths are the leaves. At the top\r\nof the branch the joints are very close together, and the leaves of\r\ndifferent form, and closely set so as to form a compact cone (_x_).\r\n\r\nA cross-section of the stem (_D_) shows much the same structure as the\r\nunderground stem, but the number of air spaces is larger, and in\r\naddition there is a large central cavity. The fibro-vascular bundles\r\n(_f.b._) are arranged in a circle, alternating with the air channels,\r\nand each one has running through it a small air passage.\r\n\r\nThe cone at the top of the branch is made up of closely set,\r\nshield-shaped leaves, which are mostly six-sided, on account of the\r\npressure. These leaves (_F_, _G_) have short stalks, and are arranged\r\nin circles about the stem. Each one has a number of spore cases\r\nhanging down from the edge, and opening by a cleft on the inner side\r\n(_G_, _sp._). They are filled with a mass of greenish spores that\r\nshake out at the slightest jar when ripe.\r\n\r\nThe sterile branches (_B_) are more slender than the spore-bearing\r\nones, and the sheaths shorter. Surrounding the joints, apparently just\r\nbelow the sheaths, but really breaking through their bases, are\r\ncircles of slender branches resembling the main branch, but more\r\nslender. The sterile branches grow to a height of forty to fifty\r\ncentimetres, and from their bushy form the popular name of the plant,\r\n\"horse-tail,\" is taken. The surface of the plant is hard and rough,\r\ndue to the presence of great quantities of flint in the epidermis,--a\r\npeculiarity common to all the species.\r\n\r\n  The stem is mainly composed of large, thin-walled cells, becoming\r\n  smaller as they approach the epidermis. The outer cells of the\r\n  ground tissue in the green branches contain chlorophyll, and the\r\n  walls of some of them are thickened. The fibro-vascular bundles\r\n  differ entirely from those of the ferns. Each bundle is nearly\r\n  triangular in section (_E_), with the point inward, and the inner\r\n  end occupied by a large air space. The tracheary tissue is only\r\n  slightly developed, being represented by a few vessels[9] (_tr._) at\r\n  the outer angles of the bundle, and one or two smaller ones close to\r\n  the air channel. The rest of the bundle is made up of nearly\r\n  uniform, rather thin-walled, colorless cells, some of which,\r\n  however, are larger, and have perforated cross-walls, representing\r\n  the sieve tubes of the fern bundle. There is no individual bundle\r\n  sheath, but the whole circle of bundles has a common outer sheath.\r\n\r\n[9] A vessel differs from a tracheid in being composed of several\r\ncells placed end to end, the partitions being wholly or partially\r\nabsorbed, so as to throw the cells into close communication.\r\n\r\n  The epidermis is composed of elongated cells whose walls present a\r\n  peculiar beaded appearance, due to the deposition of flint within\r\n  them. The breathing pores are arranged in vertical lines, and\r\n  resemble in general appearance those of the ferns, though differing\r\n  in some minor details. Like the other epidermal cells the guard\r\n  cells have heavy deposits of flint, which here are in the form of\r\n  thick transverse bars.\r\n\r\n  The spore cases have thin walls whose cells, shortly before\r\n  maturity, develop thickenings upon their walls, which have to do\r\n  with the opening of the spore case. The spores (_H_, _I_) are round\r\n  cells containing much chlorophyll and provided with four peculiar\r\n  appendages called elaters. The elaters are extremely sensitive to\r\n  changes in moisture, coiling up tightly when moistened (_I_), but\r\n  quickly springing out again when dry (_H_). By dusting a few dry\r\n  spores upon a slide, and putting it under the microscope without any\r\n  water, the movement may be easily examined. Lightly breathing upon\r\n  them will cause the elaters to contract, but in a moment, as soon as\r\n  the moisture of the breath has evaporated, they will uncoil with a\r\n  quick jerk, causing the spores to move about considerably.\r\n\r\n  The fresh spores begin to germinate within about twenty-four hours,\r\n  and the early stages, which closely resemble those of the ferns, may\r\n  be easily followed by sowing the spores in water. With care it is\r\n  possible to get the mature prothallia, which should be treated as\r\n  described for the fern prothallia. Under favorable conditions, the\r\n  first antheridia are ripe in about five weeks; the archegonia, which\r\n  are borne on separate plants, a few weeks later. The antheridia\r\n  (Fig. 72, _J_, _an._) are larger than those of the ferns, and the\r\n  spermatozoids (_K_) are thicker and with fewer coils, but otherwise\r\n  much like fern spermatozoids.\r\n\r\n  The archegonia have a shorter neck than those of the ferns, and the\r\n  neck is straight.\r\n\r\n  Both male and female prothallia are much branched and very irregular\r\n  in shape.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of common species of _Equisetum_. Some of them,\r\nlike the common scouring rush (_E. hiemale_), are unbranched, and the\r\nspores borne at the top of ordinary green branches; others have all\r\nthe stems branching like the sterile stems of the field horse-tail,\r\nbut produce a spore-bearing cone at the top of some of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--THE CLUB MOSSES (_Lycopodinæ_).\r\n\r\nThe last class of the pteridophytes includes the ground pines, club\r\nmosses, etc., and among cultivated plants numerous species of the\r\nsmaller club mosses (_Selaginella_).\r\n\r\nTwo orders are generally recognized, although there is some doubt as\r\nto the relationship of the members of the second order. The first\r\norder, the larger club mosses (_Lycopodiaceæ_) is represented in the\r\nnorthern states by a single genus (_Lycopodium_), of which the common\r\nground pine (_L. dendroideum_) (Fig. 73) is a familiar species. The\r\nplant grows in the evergreen forests of the northern United States as\r\nwell as in the mountains further south, and in the larger northern\r\ncities is often sold in large quantities at the holidays for\r\ndecorating. It sends up from a creeping, woody, subterranean stem,\r\nnumerous smaller stems which branch extensively, and are thickly set\r\nwith small moss-like leaves, the whole looking much like a little\r\ntree. At the ends of some of the branches are small cones (_A_, _x_,\r\n_B_) composed of closely overlapping, scale-like leaves, much as in a\r\nfir cone. Near the base, on the inner surface of each of these scales,\r\nis a kidney-shaped capsule (_C_, _sp._) opening by a cleft along the\r\nupper edge and filled with a mass of fine yellow powder. These\r\ncapsules are the spore cases.\r\n\r\nThe bases of the upright stems are almost bare, but become covered\r\nwith leaves higher up. The leaves are in shape like those of a moss,\r\nbut are thicker. The spore-bearing leaves are broader and when\r\nslightly magnified show a toothed margin.\r\n\r\nThe stem is traversed by a central fibro-vascular cylinder that\r\nseparates easily from the surrounding tissue, owing to the rupture of\r\nthe cells of the bundle sheath, this being particularly frequent in\r\ndried specimens. When slightly magnified the arrangement of the\r\ntissues may be seen (Fig. 73, _E_). Within the epidermis is a mass of\r\nground tissue of firm, woody texture surrounding the central oval or\r\ncircular fibro-vascular cylinder. This shows a number of white bars\r\n(xylem) surrounded by a more delicate tissue (phloem).\r\n\r\n  On magnifying the section more strongly, the cells of the ground\r\n  tissue (_G_) are seen to be oval in outline, with thick striated\r\n  walls and small intercellular spaces. Examined in longitudinal\r\n  sections they are long and pointed, belonging to the class of cells\r\n  known as \"fibres.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--_A_, a club moss (_Lycopodium_), × ⅓. _x_,\r\ncone. _r_, root. _B_, a cone, × 1. _C_, single scale with sporangium\r\n(_sp._). _D_, spores: i, from above; ii, from below, × 325. _E_, cross\r\nsection of stem, × 8. _f.b._ fibro-vascular bundle. _F_, portion of\r\nthe fibro-vascular bundle, × 150. _G_, cells of the ground tissue,\r\n× 150.]\r\n\r\n  The xylem (_F_, _xy._) of the fibro-vascular bundle is composed of\r\n  tracheids, much like those of the ferns; the phloem is composed of\r\n  narrow cells, pretty much all alike.\r\n\r\n  The spores (_D_) are destitute of chlorophyll and have upon the\r\n  outside a network of ridges, except on one side where three straight\r\n  lines converge, the spore being slightly flattened between them.\r\n\r\n  Almost nothing is known of the prothallia of our native species.\r\n\r\nThe second order (_Ligulatæ_) is represented by two very distinct\r\nfamilies: the smaller club mosses (_Selaginelleæ_) and the quill-worts\r\n(_Isoeteæ_). Of the former the majority are tropical, but are common\r\nin greenhouses where they are prized for their delicate moss-like\r\nfoliage (Fig. 74, _A_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--_A_, one of the smaller club mosses\r\n(_Selaginella_). _sp._ spore-bearing branch, × 2. _B_, part of a stem,\r\nsending down naked rooting branches (_r_), × 1. _C_, longitudinal\r\nsection of a spike, with a single macrosporangium at the base; the\r\nothers, microsporangia, × 3. _D_, a scale and microsporangium, × 5.\r\n_E_, young microsporangium, × 150.

They are arranged in four rows on the upper side of\r\nthe stem, two being larger than the others. The smaller branches grow\r\nout sideways so that the whole branch appears flattened, reminding one\r\nof the habit of the higher liverworts. Special leafless branches (_B_,\r\n_r_) often grow downward from the lower side of the main branches, and\r\non touching the ground develop roots which fork regularly.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are much like those of the ground pines, and produced\r\nsingly at the bases of scale leaves arranged in a spike or cone (_A_,\r\n_sp._), but two kinds of spores, large and small, are formed. In the\r\nspecies figured the lower sporangium produces four large spores\r\n(macrospores); the others, numerous small spores (microspores).\r\n\r\nEven before the spores are ripe the development of the prothallium\r\nbegins, and this is significant, as it shows an undoubted\r\nrelationship between these plants and the lowest of the seed plants,\r\nas we shall see when we study that group.\r\n\r\n  If ripe spores can be obtained by sowing them upon moist earth, the\r\n  young plants will appear in about a month. The microspore (Fig. 74,\r\n  _K_) produces a prothallium not unlike that of some of the water\r\n  ferns, there being a single vegetative cell (_x_), and the rest of\r\n  the prothallium forming a single antheridium. The spermatozoids are\r\n  excessively small, and resemble those of the bryophytes.\r\n\r\n  The macrospore divides into two cells, a large lower one, and a\r\n  smaller upper one. The latter gives rise to a flat disc of cells\r\n  producing a number of small archegonia of simple structure (Fig. 74,\r\n  _I_, _J_). The lower cell produces later a tissue that serves to\r\n  nourish the young embryo.\r\n\r\n  The development of the embryo recalls in some particulars that of\r\n  the seed plants, and this in connection with the peculiarities of\r\n  the sporangia warrants us in regarding the _Ligulatæ_ as the highest\r\n  of existing pteridophytes, and to a certain extent connecting them\r\n  with the lowest of the spermaphytes.\r\n\r\nResembling the smaller club mosses in their development, but differing\r\nin some important points, are the quill-worts (_Isoeteæ_). They are\r\nmostly aquatic forms, growing partially or completely submerged, and\r\nlook like grasses or rushes. They vary from a few centimetres to half\r\na metre in height. The stem is very short, and the long cylindrical\r\nleaves closely crowded together. The leaves which are narrow above are\r\nwidely expanded and overlapping at the base. The spores are of two\r\nkinds, as in _Selaginella_, but the macrosporangia contain numerous\r\nmacrospores. The very large sporangia (_M_, _sp._) are in cavities at\r\nthe bases of the leaves, and above each sporangium is a little pointed\r\noutgrowth (ligula), which is also found in the leaves of\r\n_Selaginella_. The quill-worts are not common plants, and owing to\r\ntheir habits of growth and resemblance to other plants, are likely to\r\nbe overlooked unless careful search is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM VI.\r\n\r\nSPERMAPHYTES: PHÆNOGAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last and highest great division of the vegetable kingdom has been\r\nnamed _Spermaphyta_, \"seed plants,\" from the fact that the structures\r\nknown as seeds are peculiar to them. They are also commonly called\r\nflowering plants, though this name might be also appropriately given\r\nto certain of the higher pteridophytes.\r\n\r\nIn the seed plants the macrosporangia remain attached to the parent\r\nplant, in nearly all cases, until the archegonia are fertilized and\r\nthe embryo plant formed. The outer walls of the sporangium now become\r\nhard, and the whole falls off as a seed.\r\n\r\nIn the higher spermaphytes the spore-bearing leaves (sporophylls)\r\nbecome much modified, and receive special names, those bearing the\r\nmicrospores being commonly known as stamens; those bearing the\r\nmacrospores, carpels or carpophylls. The macrosporangia are also\r\nordinarily known as \"ovules,\" a name given before it was known that\r\nthese were the same as the macrosporangia of the higher pteridophytes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the spore-bearing leaves, those surrounding them may be\r\nmuch changed in form and brilliantly colored, forming, with the\r\nenclosed sporophylls, the \"flower\" of the higher spermaphytes.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the tissues of the higher spermaphytes are the\r\nmost highly developed of all plants, though some of them are very\r\nsimple. The plants vary extremely in size, the smallest being little\r\nfloating plants, less than a millimetre in diameter, while others are\r\ngigantic trees, a hundred metres and more in height.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of the spermaphytes: I., the Gymnosperms, or\r\nnaked-seeded ones, in which the ovules (macrosporangia) are borne upon\r\nopen carpophylls; and II., Angiosperms, covered-seeded plants, in\r\nwhich the carpophylls form a closed cavity (ovary) containing the\r\novules.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--GYMNOSPERMS (_Gymnospermæ_).\r\n\r\nThe most familiar of these plants are the common evergreen trees\r\n(conifers), pines, spruces, cedars, etc. A careful study of one of\r\nthese will give a good idea of the most important characteristics of\r\nthe class, and one of the best for this purpose is the Scotch pine\r\n(_Pinus sylvestris_), which, though a native of Europe, is not\r\ninfrequently met with in cultivation in America. If this species\r\ncannot be had by the student, other pines, or indeed almost any other\r\nconifer, will answer. The Scotch pine is a tree of moderate size,\r\nsymmetrical in growth when young, with a central main shaft, and\r\ncircles of branches at regular intervals; but as it grows older its\r\ngrowth becomes irregular, and the crown is divided into several main\r\nbranches.[10] The trunk and branches are covered with a rough, scaly\r\nbark of a reddish brown color, where it is exposed by the scaling off\r\nof the outer layers. Covering the younger branches, but becoming\r\nthinner on the older ones, are numerous needle-shaped leaves. These\r\nare in pairs, and the base of each pair is surrounded by several dry,\r\nblackish scales. Each pair of leaves is really attached to a very\r\nshort side branch, but this is so short as to make the leaves appear\r\nto grow directly from the main branch. Each leaf is about ten\r\ncentimetres in length and two millimetres broad. Where the leaves are\r\nin contact they are flattened, but the outer side is rounded, so that\r\na cross-section is nearly semicircular in outline. With a lens it is\r\nseen that there are five longitudinal lines upon the surface of the\r\nleaf, and careful examination shows rows of small dots corresponding\r\nto these. These dots are the breathing pores. If a cross-section is\r\neven slightly magnified it shows three distinct parts,--a whitish\r\nouter border, a bright green zone, and a central oval, colorless area,\r\nin which, with a little care, may be seen the sections of two\r\nfibro-vascular bundles. In the green zone are sometimes to be seen\r\ncolorless spots, sections of resin ducts, containing the resin so\r\ncharacteristic of the tissues of the conifers.\r\n\r\n[10] In most conifers the symmetrical form of the young tree is\r\nmaintained as long as the tree lives.\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the stem may be understood by making a series\r\nof cross-sections through branches of different ages. In all, three\r\nregions are distinguishable; viz., an outer region (bark or cortex)\r\n(Fig. 76, _A_, _c_), composed in part of green cells, and, if the\r\nsection has been made with a sharp knife, showing a circle of little\r\nopenings, from each of which oozes a clear drop of resin. These are\r\nlarge resin ducts (_r_). The centre is occupied by a soft white tissue\r\n(pith), and the space between the pith and bark is filled by a mass of\r\nwoody tissue. Traversing the wood are numerous radiating lines, some\r\nof which run from the bark to the pith, others only part way. These\r\nare called the medullary rays. While in sections from branches of any\r\nage these three regions are recognizable, their relative size varies\r\nextremely. In a section of a twig of the present year the bark and\r\npith make up a considerable part of the section; but as older branches\r\nare examined, we find a rapid increase in the quantity of wood, while\r\nthe thickness of the bark increases but slowly, and the pith scarcely\r\nat all. In the wood, too, each year's growth is marked by a distinct\r\nring (_A_ i, ii). As the branches grow in diameter the outer bark\r\nbecomes split and irregular, and portions die, becoming brown and\r\nhard.\r\n\r\nThe tree has a very perfect root system, but different from that of\r\nany pteridophytes. The first root of the embryo persists as the main\r\nor \"tap\" root of the full-grown tree, and from it branch off the\r\nsecondary roots, which in turn give rise to others.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are borne on special scale-like leaves, and arranged\r\nvery much as in certain pteridophytes, notably the club mosses; but\r\ninstead of large and small spores being produced near together, the\r\ntwo kinds are borne on special branches, or even on distinct trees\r\n(_e.g._ red cedar). In the Scotch pine the microspores are ripe about\r\nthe end of May. The leaves bearing them are aggregated in small cones\r\n(\"flowers\"), crowded about the base of a growing shoot terminating the\r\nbranches (Fig. 77, _A_ ♂). The individual leaves (sporophylls) are\r\nnearly triangular in shape, and attached by the smaller end. On the\r\nlower side of each are borne two sporangia (pollen sacs) (_C_, _sp._),\r\nopening by a longitudinal slit, and filled with innumerable yellow\r\nmicrospores (pollen spores), which fall out as a shower of yellow dust\r\nif the branch is shaken.\r\n\r\nThe macrosporangia (ovules) are borne on similar leaves, known as\r\ncarpels, and, like the pollen sacs, borne in pairs, but on the upper\r\nside of the sporophyll instead of the lower. The female flowers appear\r\nwhen the pollen is ripe. The leaves of which they are composed are\r\nthicker than those of the male flowers, and of a pinkish color. At the\r\nbase on the upper side are borne the two ovules (macrosporangia)\r\n(Fig. 77, _E_, _o_), and running through the centre is a ridge that\r\nends in a little spine or point.\r\n\r\nThe ovule-bearing leaf has on the back a scale with fringed edge (_F_,\r\n_sc._), quite conspicuous when the flower is young, but scarcely to be\r\ndetected in the older cone. From the female flower is developed the\r\ncone (Fig. 75, _A_), but the process is a slow one, occupying two\r\nyears. Shortly after the pollen is shed, the female flowers, which are\r\nat first upright, bend downward, and assume a brownish color, growing\r\nconsiderably in size for a short time, and then ceasing to grow for\r\nseveral months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Scotch pine (_Pinus sylvestris_). _A_, a ripe\r\ncone, × ½. _B_, a year-old cone, × 1. _C_, longitudinal section of\r\n_B_. _D_, a single scale of _B_, showing the sporangia (ovules) (_o_),\r\n× 2. _E_, a scale from a ripe cone, with the seeds (_s_), × ½. _F_,\r\nlongitudinal section of a ripe seed, × 3. _em._ the embryo. _G_, a\r\ngerminating seed, × 2. _r_, the primary root. _H_, longitudinal\r\nsection through _G_, showing the first leaves of the young plant still\r\nsurrounded by the endosperm, × 4. _I_, an older plant with the leaves\r\n(_l_) withdrawing from the seed coats, × 4. _J_, upper part of a young\r\nplant, showing the circle of primary leaves (cotyledons), × 1. _K_,\r\nsection of the same, × 2. _b_, the terminal bud. _L_, cross-section of\r\nthe stem of the young plant, × 25. _fb._ a fibro-vascular bundle. _M_,\r\ncross-section of the root, × 25. _x_, wood. _ph._ bast, of the\r\nfibro-vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\nIn Figure 75, _B_, is shown such a flower as it appears in the winter\r\nand early spring following. The leaves are thick and fleshy, closely\r\npressed together, as is seen by dividing the flower lengthwise, and\r\neach leaf ends in a long point (_D_). The ovules are still very small.\r\nAs the growth of the tree is resumed in the spring, the flower (cone)\r\nincreases rapidly in size and becomes decidedly green in color, the\r\novules increasing also very much in size. If a scale from such a cone\r\nis examined about the first of June, the ovules will probably be\r\nnearly full-grown, oval, whitish bodies two to three millimetres in\r\nlength. A careful longitudinal section of the scale through the ovule\r\nwill show the general structure. Such a section is shown in Figure 77,\r\n_G_. Comparing this with the sporangia of the pteridophytes, the first\r\ndifference that strikes us is the presence of an outer coat or\r\nintegument (_in._), which is absent in the latter. The single\r\nmacrospore (_sp._) is very large and does not lie free in the cavity\r\nof the sporangium, but is in close contact with its wall. It is filled\r\nwith a colorless tissue, the prothallium, and if mature, with care it\r\nis possible to see, even with a hand lens, two or more denser oval\r\nbodies (_ar._), the egg cells of the archegonia, which here are very\r\nlarge. The integument is not entirely closed at the top, but leaves a\r\nlittle opening through which the pollen spores entered when the flower\r\nwas first formed.\r\n\r\nAfter the archegonia are fertilized the outer parts of the ovule\r\nbecome hard and brown, and serve to protect the embryo plant, which\r\nreaches a considerable size before the sporangium falls off. As the\r\nwalls of the ovule harden, the carpel or leaf bearing it undergoes a\r\nsimilar change, becoming extremely hard and woody, and as each one\r\nends in a sharp spine, and they are tightly packed together, it is\r\nalmost impossible to separate them. The ripe cone (Fig. 75, _A_)\r\nremains closed during the winter, but in the spring, about the time\r\nthe flowers are mature, the scales open spontaneously and discharge\r\nthe ripened ovules, now called seeds. Each seed (_E_, _s_) is\r\nsurrounded by a membranous envelope derived from the scale to which it\r\nis attached, which becomes easily separated from the seed. The opening\r\nof the cones is caused by drying, and if a number of ripe cones are\r\ngathered in the winter or early spring, and allowed to dry in an\r\nordinary room, they will in a day or two open, often with a sharp,\r\ncrackling sound, and scatter the ripe seeds.\r\n\r\nA section of a ripe seed (_F_) shows the embryo (_em._) surrounded by\r\na dense, white, starch-bearing tissue derived from the prothallium\r\ncells, and called the \"endosperm.\" This fills up the whole seed which\r\nis surrounded by the hardened shell derived from the integument and\r\nwall of the ovule. The embryo is elongated with a circle of small\r\nleaves at the end away from the opening of the ovule toward which is\r\ndirected the root of the embryo.\r\n\r\nThe seed may remain unchanged for months, or even years, without\r\nlosing its vitality, but if the proper conditions are provided, the\r\nembryo will develop into a new plant. To follow the further growth of\r\nthe embryo, the ripe seeds should be planted in good soil and kept\r\nmoderately warm and moist. At the end of a week or two some of the\r\nseeds will probably have sprouted. The seed absorbs water, and the\r\nprotoplasm of the embryo renews its activity, beginning to feed upon\r\nthe nourishing substances in the cells of the endosperm. The embryo\r\nrapidly increases in length, and the root pushes out of the seed\r\ngrowing rapidly downward and fastening itself in the soil (_G_, _r_).\r\nCutting the seed lengthwise we find that the leaves have increased\r\nmuch in length and become green (one of the few cases where\r\nchlorophyll is formed in the absence of light). As these leaves\r\n(called \"cotyledons\" or seed leaves) increase in length, they\r\ngradually withdraw from the seed whose contents they have exhausted,\r\nand the young plant enters upon an independent existence.\r\n\r\nThe young plant has a circle of leaves, about six in number,\r\nsurrounding a bud which is the growing point of the stem, and in many\r\nconifers persists as long as the stem grows (Fig. 75, _K_, _b_). A\r\ncross-section of the young stem shows about six separate\r\nfibro-vascular bundles arranged in a circle (_S_, _fb._). The root\r\nshows a central fibro-vascular cylinder surrounded by a dark-colored\r\nground tissue. Growing from its surface are numerous root hairs\r\n(Fig. 75, _M_).\r\n\r\n  For examining the microscopic structure of the pine, fresh material\r\n  is for most purposes to be preferred, but alcoholic material will\r\n  answer, and as the alcohol hardens the resin, it is for that reason\r\n  preferable.\r\n\r\n  Cross-sections of the leaf, when sufficiently magnified, show that\r\n  the outer colorless border of the section is composed of two parts:\r\n  the epidermis of a single row of regular cells with very thick outer\r\n  walls, and irregular groups of cells lying below them. These latter\r\n  have thick walls appearing silvery and clearer than the epidermal\r\n  cells. They vary a good deal, in some leaves being reduced to a\r\n  single row, in others forming very conspicuous groups of some size.\r\n  The green tissue of the leaf is much more compact than in the fern\r\n  we examined, and the cells are more nearly round and the\r\n  intercellular spaces smaller. The chloroplasts are numerous and\r\n  nearly round in shape.\r\n\r\n  Scattered through the green tissue are several resin passages (_r_),\r\n  each surrounded by a circle of colorless, thick-walled cells, like\r\n  those under the epidermis. At intervals in the latter are\r\n  openings--breathing pores--(Fig. 76, _J_), below each of which is an\r\n  intercellular space (_i_). They are in structure like those of the\r\n  ferns, but the walls of the guard cells are much thickened like the\r\n  other epidermal cells.\r\n\r\n  Each leaf is traversed by two fibro-vascular bundles of entirely\r\n  different structure from those of the ferns. Each is divided into\r\n  two nearly equal parts, the wood (_x_) lying toward the inner, flat\r\n  side of the leaf, the bast (_T_) toward the outer, convex side. This\r\n  type of bundle, called \"collateral,\" is the common form found in the\r\n  stems and leaves of seed plants. The cells of the wood or xylem are\r\n  rather larger than those of the bast or phloem, and have thicker\r\n  walls than any of the phloem cells, except the outermost ones which\r\n  are thick-walled fibres like those under the epidermis. Lying\r\n  between the bundles are comparatively large colorless cells, and\r\n  surrounding the whole central area is a single line of cells that\r\n  separates it sharply from the surrounding green tissue.\r\n\r\n  In longitudinal sections, the cells, except of the mesophyll (green\r\n  tissue) are much elongated. The mesophyll cells, however, are short\r\n  and the intercellular spaces much more evident than in the\r\n  cross-section. The colorless cells have frequently rounded\r\n  depressions or pits upon their walls, and in the fibro-vascular\r\n  bundle the difference between the two portions becomes more obvious.\r\n  The wood is distinguished by the presence of vessels with close,\r\n  spiral or ring-shaped thickenings, while in the phloem are found\r\n  sieve tubes, not unlike those in the ferns.\r\n\r\n  The fibro-vascular bundles of the stem of the seedling plant show a\r\n  structure quite similar to that of the leaf, but very soon a\r\n  difference is manifested. Between the two parts of the bundle the\r\n  cells continue to divide and add constantly to the size of the\r\n  bundle, and at the same time the bundles become connected by a line\r\n  of similar growing cells, so that very early we find a ring of\r\n  growing cells extending completely around the stem. As the cells in\r\n  this ring increase in number, owing to their rapid division, those\r\n  on the borders of the ring lose the power of dividing, and gradually\r\n  assume the character of the cells on which they border (Fig. 76,\r\n  _B_, _cam._). The growth on the inside of the ring is more rapid\r\n  than on the outer border, and the ring continues comparatively near\r\n  the surface of the stem (Fig. 76, _A_, _cam._). The spaces between\r\n  the bundles do not increase materially in breadth, and as the\r\n  bundles increase in size become in comparison very small, appearing\r\n  in older stems as mere lines between the solid masses of wood that\r\n  make up the inner portion of the bundles. These are the primary\r\n  medullary rays, and connect the pith in the centre of the stem with\r\n  the bark. Later, similar plates of cells are formed, often only a\r\n  single cell thick, and appearing when seen in cross-section as a\r\n  single row of elongated cells (_C_, _m_).\r\n\r\n  As the stem increases in diameter the bundles become broader and\r\n  broader toward the outside, and taper to a point toward the centre,\r\n  appearing wedge-shaped, the inner ends projecting into the pith. The\r\n  outer limits of the bundles are not nearly so distinct, and it is\r\n  not easy to tell when the phloem of the bundles ends and the ground\r\n  tissue of the bark begins.\r\n\r\n  A careful examination of a cross-section of the bark shows first, if\r\n  taken from a branch not more than two or three years old, the\r\n  epidermis composed of cells not unlike those of the leaf, but whose\r\n  walls are usually browner. Underneath are cells with brownish walls,\r\n  and often more or less dry and dead. These cells give the brown\r\n  color to the bark, and later both epidermis and outer ground tissue\r\n  become entirely dead and disappear. The bulk of the ground tissue is\r\n  made up of rather large, loose cells, the outer ones containing a\r\n  good deal of chlorophyll. Here and there are large resin ducts\r\n  (Fig. 76, _H_), appearing in cross-section as oval openings\r\n  surrounded by several concentric rows of cells, the innermost\r\n  smaller and with denser contents. These secrete the resin that fills\r\n  the duct and oozes out when the stem is cut. All of the cells of the\r\n  bark contain more or less starch.\r\n\r\n  The phloem, when strongly magnified, is seen to be made up of cells\r\n  arranged in nearly regular radiating rows. Their walls are not very\r\n  thick and the cells are usually somewhat flattened in a radial\r\n  direction.\r\n\r\n  Some of the cells are larger than the others, and these are found to\r\n  be, when examined in longitudinal section, sieve tubes (Fig. 76,\r\n  _E_) with numerous lateral sieve plates quite similar to those found\r\n  in the stems of ferns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Scotch pine. _A_, cross-section of a\r\ntwo-year-old branch, × 3. _p_, pith. _c_, bark.

These cells (_B_,\r\n  _cam._) are arranged in radial rows and divide, mainly by walls, at\r\n  right angles to the radii of the stem. If we examine the inner side\r\n  of the ring, the change the cells undergo is more marked. They\r\n  become of nearly equal diameter in all directions, and the walls\r\n  become woody, showing at the same time distinct stratification (_B_,\r\n  _x_).\r\n\r\n  On examining the xylem, where two growth rings are in contact, the\r\n  reason of the sharply marked line seen when the stem is examined\r\n  with the naked eye is obvious. On the inner side of this line (_I_),\r\n  the wood cells are comparatively small and much flattened, while the\r\n  walls are quite as heavy as those of the much larger cells (_II_)\r\n  lying on the outer side of the line. The small cells show the point\r\n  where growth ceased at the end of the season, the cells becoming\r\n  smaller as growth was feebler. The following year when growth\r\n  commenced again, the first wood cells formed by the cambium were\r\n  much larger, as growth is most vigorous at this time, and the wood\r\n  formed of these larger cells is softer and lighter colored than that\r\n  formed of the smaller cells of the autumn growth.\r\n\r\n  The wood is mainly composed of tracheids, there being no vessels\r\n  formed except the first year. These tracheids are characterized by\r\n  the presence of peculiar pits upon their walls, best seen when thin\r\n  longitudinal sections are made in a radial direction. These pits\r\n  (Fig. 76, _D_, _p_) appear in this view as double circles, but if\r\n  cut across, as often happens in a cross-section of the stem, or in a\r\n  longitudinal section at right angles to the radius (tangential),\r\n  they are seen to be in shape something like an inverted saucer with\r\n  a hole through the bottom. They are formed in pairs, one on each\r\n  side of the wall of adjacent tracheids, and are separated by a very\r\n  delicate membrane (_F_, _p_, _G_, _y_). These \"bordered\" pits are\r\n  very characteristic of the wood of all conifers.\r\n\r\n  The structure of the root is best studied in the seedling plant, or\r\n  in a rootlet of an older one. The general plan of the root is much\r\n  like that of the pteridophytes. The fibro-vascular bundle (Fig. 75,\r\n  _M_, _fb._) is of the so-called radial type, there being three xylem\r\n  masses (_x_) alternating with as many phloem masses (_ph._) in the\r\n  root of the seedling. This regularity becomes destroyed as the root\r\n  grows older by the formation of a cambium ring, something like that\r\n  in the stem.\r\n\r\n  The development of the sporangia is on the whole much like that of\r\n  the club mosses, and will not be examined here in detail. The\r\n  microspores (pollen spores) are formed in groups of four in\r\n  precisely the same way as the spores of the bryophytes and\r\n  pteridophytes, and by collecting the male flowers as they begin to\r\n  appear in the spring, and crushing the sporangia in water, the\r\n  process of division may be seen. For more careful examination they\r\n  may be crushed in a mixture of water and acetic acid, to which is\r\n  added a little gentian violet. This mixture fixes and stains the\r\n  nuclei of the spores, and very instructive preparations may thus be\r\n  made.[11]\r\n\r\n[11] See the last chapter for details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Scotch pine (except _E_ and _F_). _A_, end of\r\na branch bearing a cluster of male flowers (♂), × ½. _B_, a similar\r\nbranch, with two young female flowers (♀), natural size. _C_, a scale\r\nfrom a male flower, showing the two sporangia (_sp._); × 5. _D_, a\r\nsingle ripe pollen spore (microspore), showing the vegetative cell\r\n(_x_), × 150. _E_, a similar scale, from a female flower of the\r\nAustrian pine, seen from within, × 4. _o_, the sporangium (ovule).\r\n_F_, the same, seen from the back, showing the scale (_sc._) attached\r\nto the back. _G_, longitudinal section through a full-grown ovule of\r\nthe Scotch pine. _p_, a pollen spore sending down its tube to the\r\narchegonia (_ar._). _sp._ the prothallium (endosperm), filling up the\r\nembryo sac, × 10. _H_, the neck of the archegonium, × 150.]\r\n\r\n  The ripe pollen spores (Fig. 77, _D_) are oval cells provided with\r\n  a double wall, the outer one giving rise to two peculiar\r\n  bladder-like appendages (_z_). Like the microspores of the smaller\r\n  club mosses, a small cell is cut off from the body of the spore\r\n  (_x_). These pollen spores are carried by the wind to the ovules,\r\n  where they germinate.\r\n\r\n  The wall of the ripe sporangium or pollen sac is composed of a\r\n  single layer of cells in most places, and these cells are provided\r\n  with thickened ridges which have to do with opening the pollen sac.\r\n\r\n  We have already examined in some detail the structure of the\r\n  macrosporangium or ovule. In the full-grown ovule the macrospore,\r\n  which in the seed plants is generally known as the \"embryo sac,\" is\r\n  completely filled with the prothallium or \"endosperm.\" In the upper\r\n  part of the prothallium several large archegonia are formed in much\r\n  the same way as in the pteridophytes. The egg cell is very large,\r\n  and appears of a yellowish color, and filled with large drops that\r\n  give it a peculiar aspect. There is a large nucleus, but it is not\r\n  always readily distinguished from the other contents of the egg\r\n  cell. The neck of the archegonium is quite long, but does not\r\n  project above the surface of the prothallium (Fig. 77, _H_).\r\n\r\nThe pollen spores are produced in great numbers, and many of them fall\r\nupon the female flowers, which when ready for pollination have the\r\nscales somewhat separated. The pollen spores now sift down to the base\r\nof the scales, and finally reach the opening of the ovule, where they\r\ngerminate. No spermatozoids are produced, the seed plants differing in\r\nthis respect from all pteridophytes. The pollen spore bursts its\r\nouter coat, and sends out a tube which penetrates for some distance\r\ninto the tissue of the ovule, acting very much as a parasitic fungus\r\nwould do, and growing at the expense of the tissue through which it\r\ngrows. After a time growth ceases, and is not resumed until the\r\ndevelopment of the female prothallium and archegonia is nearly\r\ncomplete, which does not occur until more than a year from the time\r\nthe pollen spore first reaches the ovule. Finally the pollen tube\r\npenetrates down to and through the open neck of the archegonium, until\r\nit comes in contact with the egg cell. These stages can only be seen\r\nby careful sections through a number of ripe ovules, but the track of\r\nthe pollen tube is usually easy to follow, as the cells along it are\r\noften brown and apparently dead (Fig. 77, _G_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE GYMNOSPERMS.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of the gymnosperms: I., cycads (_Cycadeæ_);\r\nII., conifers (_Coniferæ_); III., joint firs (_Gnetaceæ_). All of the\r\ngymnosperms of the northern United States belong to the second order,\r\nbut representatives of the others are found in the southern and\r\nsouthwestern states.\r\n\r\nThe cycads are palm-like forms having a single trunk crowned by a\r\ncircle of compound leaves. Several species are grown for ornament in\r\nconservatories, and a few species occur native in Florida, but\r\notherwise do not occur within our limits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Illustrations of gymnosperms. _A_, fruiting\r\nleaf of a cycad (_Cycas_), with macrosporangia (ovules) (_ov._), × ¼.\r\n_B_, leaf of _Gingko_, × ½. _C_, branch of hemlock (_Tsuga_), with a\r\nripe cone, × 1. _D_, red cedar (_Juniperus_), × 1. _E_, _Arbor-vitæ_\r\n(_Thuja_), × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe spore-bearing leaves usually form cones, recalling somewhat in\r\nstructure those of the horse-tails, but one of the commonest\r\ncultivated species (_Cycas revoluta_) bears the ovules, which are very\r\nlarge, upon leaves that are in shape much like the ordinary ones\r\n(Fig. 78, _A_).\r\n\r\nOf the conifers, there are numerous familiar forms, including all our\r\ncommon evergreen trees. There are two sub-orders,--the true conifers\r\nand the yews. In the latter there is no true cone, but the ovules are\r\nborne singly at the end of a branch, and the seed in the yew (_Taxus_)\r\nis surrounded by a bright red, fleshy integument. One species of yew,\r\na low, straggling shrub, occurs sparingly in the northern states, and\r\nis the only representative of the group at the north. The European yew\r\nand the curious Japanese _Gingko_ (Fig. 78, _B_) are sometimes met\r\nwith in cultivation.\r\n\r\nOf the true conifers, there are a number of families, based on\r\npeculiarities in the leaves and cones. Some have needle-shaped leaves\r\nand dry cones like the firs, spruces, hemlock (Fig. 78, _C_). Others\r\nhave flattened, scale-like leaves, and more or less fleshy cones, like\r\nthe red cedar (Fig. 78, _D_) and _Arbor-vitæ_ (_E_).\r\n\r\nA few of the conifers, such as the tamarack or larch (_Larix_) and\r\ncypress (_Taxodium_), lose their leaves in the autumn, and are not,\r\ntherefore, properly \"evergreen.\"\r\n\r\nThe conifers include some of the most valuable as well as the largest\r\nof trees. Their timber, especially that of some of the pines, is\r\nparticularly valuable, and the resin of some of them is also of much\r\ncommercial importance. Here belong the giant red-woods (_Sequoia_) of\r\nCalifornia, the largest of all American trees.\r\n\r\nThe joint firs are comparatively small plants, rarely if ever reaching\r\nthe dimensions of trees. They are found in various parts of the world,\r\nbut are few in number, and not at all likely to be met with by the\r\nordinary student. Their flowers are rather more highly differentiated\r\nthan those of the other gymnosperms, and are said to show some\r\napproach in structure to those of the angiosperms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nSPERMAPHYTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--ANGIOSPERMS.\r\n\r\nThe angiosperms include an enormous assemblage of plants, all those\r\nordinarily called \"flowering plants\" belonging here. There is almost\r\ninfinite variety shown in the form and structure of the tissues and\r\norgans, this being particularly the case with the flowers. As already\r\nstated, the ovules, instead of being borne on open carpels, are\r\nenclosed in a cavity formed by a single closed carpel or several\r\nunited carpels. To the organ so formed the name \"pistil\" is usually\r\napplied, and this is known as \"simple\" or \"compound,\" as it is\r\ncomposed of one or of two or more carpels. The leaves bearing the\r\npollen spores are also much modified, and form the so-called\r\n\"stamens.\" In addition to the spore-bearing leaves there are usually\r\nother modified leaves surrounding them, these being often brilliantly\r\ncolored and rendering the flower very conspicuous. To these leaves\r\nsurrounding the sporophylls, the general name of \"perianth\" or\r\n\"perigone\" is given. The perigone has a twofold purpose, serving both\r\nto protect the sporophylls, and, at least in bright-colored flowers,\r\nto attract insects which, as we shall see, are important agents in\r\ntransferring pollen from one flower to another.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the embryo sac (macrospore) of the angiosperms with\r\nthat of the gymnosperms a great difference is noticed, there being\r\nmuch more difference than between the latter and the higher\r\npteridophytes. Unfortunately there are very few plants where the\r\nstructure of the embryo sac can be readily seen without very skilful\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\n  There are, however, a few plants in which the ovules are very small\r\n  and transparent, so that they may be mounted whole and examined\r\n  alive. The best plant for this purpose is probably the \"Indian pipe\"\r\n  or \"ghost flower,\" a curious plant growing in rich woods, blossoming\r\n  in late summer. It is a parasite or saprophyte, and entirely\r\n  destitute of chlorophyll, being pure white throughout. It bears a\r\n  single nodding flower at the summit of the stem. (Another species\r\n  much like it, but having several brownish flowers, is shown in\r\n  Figure 115, _L_.)\r\n\r\n  If this plant can be had, the structure of the ovule and embryo sac\r\n  may be easily studied, by simply stripping away the tissue bearing\r\n  the numerous minute ovules, and mounting a few of them in water, or\r\n  water to which a little sugar has been added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--_A_, ripe ovule of _Monotropa uniflora_, in\r\noptical section, × 100. _m_, micropyle. _e_, embryo sac. _B_, the\r\nembryo sac, × 300. At the top is the egg apparatus, consisting of the\r\ntwo synergidæ (_s_), and the egg cell (_o_). In the centre is the\r\n\"endosperm nucleus\" (_k_). At the bottom, the \"antipodal cells\" (_g_).]\r\n\r\n  The ovules are attached to a stalk, and each consists of about two\r\n  layers of colorless cells enclosing a central, large, oblong cell\r\n  (Fig. 79, _A_, _E_), the embryo sac or macrospore. If the ovule is\r\n  from a flower that has been open for some time, we shall find in the\r\n  centre of the embryo sac a large nucleus (_k_) (or possibly two\r\n  which afterward unite into one), and at each end three cells. Those\r\n  at the base (_g_) probably represent the prothallium, and those at\r\n  the upper end a very rudimentary archegonium, here generally called\r\n  the \"egg apparatus.\"\r\n\r\n  Of the three cells of the \"egg apparatus\" the lower (_o_) one is the\r\n  egg cell; the others are called \"synergidæ.\" The structure of the\r\n  embryo sac and ovules is quite constant among the angiosperms, the\r\n  differences being mainly in the shape of the ovules, and the degree\r\n  to which its coverings or integuments are developed.\r\n\r\n  The pollen spores of many angiosperms will germinate very easily in\r\n  a solution of common sugar in water: about fifteen per cent of sugar\r\n  is the best. A very good plant for this purpose is the sweet pea,\r\n  whose pollen germinates very rapidly, especially in warm weather.\r\n  The spores may be sown in a little of the sugar solution in any\r\n  convenient vessel, or in a hanging drop suspended in a moist\r\n  chamber, as described for germinating the spores of the slime\r\n  moulds. The tube begins to develop within a few minutes after the\r\n  spores are placed in the solution, and within an hour or so will\r\n  have reached a considerable length. Each spore has two nuclei, but\r\n  they are less evident here than in some other forms (Fig. 79).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Germinating pollen spores of the sweet pea,\r\n× 200.]\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the pistil is variously modified, having either\r\nlittle papillæ which hold the pollen spores, or are viscid. In either\r\ncase the spores germinate when placed upon this receptive part\r\n(stigma) of the pistil, and send their tubes down through the tissues\r\nof the pistil until they reach the ovules, which are fertilized much\r\nas in the gymnosperms.\r\n\r\nThe effect of fertilization extends beyond the ovule, the ovary and\r\noften other parts of the flower being affected, enlarging and often\r\nbecoming bright-colored and juicy, forming the various fruits of the\r\nangiosperms. These fruits when ripe may be either dry, as in the case\r\nof grains of various kinds, beans, peas, etc.; or the ripe fruit may\r\nbe juicy, serving in this way to attract animals of many kinds which\r\nfeed on the juicy pulp, and leave the hard seeds uninjured, thus\r\nhelping to distribute them. Common examples of these fleshy fruits are\r\noffered by the berries of many plants; apples, melons, cherries, etc.,\r\nare also familiar examples.\r\n\r\nThe seeds differ a good deal both in regard to size and the degree to\r\nwhich the embryo is developed at the time the seed ripens.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE ANGIOSPERMS.\r\n\r\nThe angiosperms are divided into two sub-classes: I. _Monocotyledons_\r\nand II. _Dicotyledons_.\r\n\r\nThe monocotyledons comprise many familiar plants, both ornamental and\r\nuseful. They have for the most part elongated, smooth-edged leaves\r\nwith parallel veins, and the parts of the flower are in threes in the\r\nmajority of them. As their name indicates, there is but one cotyledon\r\nor seed leaf, and the leaves from the first are alternate. As a rule\r\nthe embryo is very small and surrounded by abundant endosperm.\r\n\r\nThe most thoroughly typical members of the sub-class are the lilies\r\nand their relatives. The one selected for special study here, the\r\nyellow adder-tongue, is very common in the spring; but if not\r\naccessible, almost any liliaceous plant will answer. Of garden\r\nflowers, the tulip, hyacinth, narcissus, or one of the common lilies\r\nmay be used; of wild flowers, the various species of _Trillium_\r\n(Fig. 83, _A_) are common and easily studied forms, but the leaves are\r\nnot of the type common to most monocotyledons.\r\n\r\nThe yellow adder-tongue (_Erythronium americanum_) (Fig. 81) is one of\r\nthe commonest and widespread of wild flowers, blossoming in the\r\nnorthern states from about the middle of April till the middle of May.\r\nMost of the plants found will not be in flower, and these send up but\r\na single, oblong, pointed leaf. The flowering plant has two similar\r\nleaves, one of which is usually larger than the other. They seem to\r\ncome directly from the ground, but closer examination shows that they\r\nare attached to a stem of considerable length entirely buried in the\r\nground. This arises from a small bulb (_B_) to whose base numerous\r\nroots (_r_) are attached. Rising from between the leaves is a slender,\r\nleafless stalk bearing a single, nodding flower at the top.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are perfectly smooth, dull purplish red on the lower side,\r\nand pale green with purplish blotches above. The epidermis may be very\r\neasily removed, and is perfectly colorless. Examined closely,\r\nlongitudinal rows of whitish spots may be detected: these are the\r\nbreathing pores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--_A_, plant of the yellow adder-tongue\r\n(_Erythronium americanum_), × ⅓. _B_, the bulb of the same, × ½. _r_,\r\nroots. _C_, section of _B_. _st._ the base of the stem bearing the\r\nbulb for next year (_b_) at its base. _D_, a single petal and stamen,\r\n× ½. _f_, the filament. _an._ anther. _E_, the gynœcium (pistil), × 1.\r\n_o_, ovary. _st._ style. _z_, stigma. _F_, a full-grown fruit, × ½.\r\n_G_, section of a full-grown macrosporangium (ovule), × 25: i, ii, the\r\ntwo integuments. _sp._ macrospore (embryo sac). _H_, cross-section of\r\nthe ripe anther, × 12. _I_, a single pollen spore, × 150, showing the\r\ntwo nuclei (_n_, _nʹ_). _J_, a ripe seed, × 2. _K_, the same, in\r\nlongitudinal section. _em._ the embryo. _L_, cross-section of the\r\nstem, × 12. _fb._ fibro-vascular bundle. _M_, diagram of the flower.]\r\n\r\nA cross-section of the stem shows numerous whitish areas scattered\r\nthrough it. These are the fibro-vascular bundles which in the\r\nmonocotyledons are of a simple type. The bulb is composed of thick\r\nscales, which are modified leaves, and on cutting it lengthwise, we\r\nshall probably find the young bulb of next year (Fig. _C_, _b_)\r\nalready forming inside it, the young bulb arising as a bud at the\r\nbase of the stem of the present year.\r\n\r\nThe flower is made up of five circles of very much modified leaves,\r\nthree leaves in each set. The two outer circles are much alike, but\r\nthe three outermost leaves are slightly narrower and strongly tinged\r\nwith red on the back, completely concealing the three inner ones\r\nbefore the flower expands. The latter are pure yellow, except for a\r\nridge along the back, and a few red specks near the base inside. These\r\nsix leaves constitute the perigone of the flower; the three outer are\r\ncalled sepals, the inner ones petals.\r\n\r\nThe next two circles are composed of the sporophylls bearing the\r\npollen spores.[12] These are the stamens, and taken collectively are\r\nknown as the \"_Andrœcium_.\" Each leaf or stamen consists of two\r\ndistinct portions, a delicate stalk or \"filament\" (_D_, _f_), and the\r\nupper spore-bearing part, the \"anther\" (_an._). The anther in the\r\nfreshly opened flower has a smooth, red surface; but shortly after,\r\nthe flower opens, splits along each side, and discharges the pollen\r\nspores. A section across the anther shows it to be composed of four\r\nsporangia or pollen sacs attached to a common central axis\r\n(\"connective\") (Fig. _H_).\r\n\r\n[12] The three outer stamens are shorter than the inner set.\r\n\r\nThe central circle of leaves, the carpels (collectively the\r\n\"gynœcium\") are completely united to form a compound pistil (Fig. 81,\r\n_E_). This shows three distinct portions, the ovule-bearing portion\r\nbelow (_o_), the \"ovary,\" a stalk above (_st._), the \"style,\" and the\r\nreceptive portion (_z_) at the top, the \"stigma.\" Both stigma and\r\novary show plainly their compound nature, the former being divided\r\ninto three lobes, the latter completely divided into three chambers,\r\nas well as being flattened at the sides with a more or less decided\r\nseam at the three angles. The ovules, which are quite large, are\r\narranged in two rows in each chamber of the ovary, attached to the\r\ncentral column (\"placenta\").\r\n\r\nThe flowers open for several days in succession, but only when the sun\r\nis shining. They are visited by numerous insects which carry the\r\npollen from one flower to another and deposit it upon the stigma,\r\nwhere it germinates, and the tube, growing down through the long\r\nstyle, finally reaches the ovules and fertilizes them. Usually only a\r\ncomparatively small number of the seeds mature, there being almost\r\nalways a number of imperfect ones in each pod. The pod or fruit (_F_)\r\nis full-grown about a month after the flower opens, and finally\r\nseparates into three parts, and discharges the seeds. These are quite\r\nlarge (Fig. 81, _J_) and covered with a yellowish brown outer coat,\r\nand provided with a peculiar, whitish, spongy appendage attaching it\r\nto the placenta. A longitudinal section of a ripe seed (_K_) shows the\r\nvery small, nearly triangular embryo (_em._), while the rest of the\r\ncavity of the seed is filled with a white, starch-bearing tissue, the\r\nendosperm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--_Erythronium_. _A_, a portion of the wall of\r\nthe anther, × 150. _B_, a single epidermal cell from the petal, × 150.\r\n_C_, cross-section of a fibro-vascular bundle of the stem, × 150.\r\n_tr._ vessels. _D_, _E_, longitudinal section of the same, showing the\r\nmarkings of the vessels, × 150. _F_, a bit of the epidermis from the\r\nlower surface of a leaf, showing the breathing pores, × 50. _G_, a\r\nsingle breathing pore, × 200. _H_, cross-section of a leaf, × 50.\r\n_st._ a breathing pore. _m_, the mesophyll. _fb._ a vein. _I_,\r\ncross-section of a breathing pore, × 200. _J_, young embryo, × 150.]\r\n\r\n  A microscopical examination of the tissues of the plant shows them\r\n  to be comparatively simple, this being especially the case with the\r\n  fibro-vascular system.\r\n\r\n  The epidermis of the leaf is readily removed, and examination shows\r\n  it to be made up of oblong cells with large breathing pores in\r\n  rows. The breathing pores are much larger than any we have yet\r\n  seen, and are of the type common to most angiosperms. The ordinary\r\n  epidermal cells are quite destitute of chlorophyll, but the two\r\n  cells (guard cells) enclosing the breathing pore contain numerous\r\n  chloroplasts, and the oblong nuclei of these cells are usually\r\n  conspicuous (Fig. 82, _G_). By placing a piece of the leaf between\r\n  pieces of pith, and making a number of thin cross-sections at right\r\n  angles to the longer axis of the leaf, some of the breathing pores\r\n  will probably be cut across, and their structure may be then better\r\n  understood. Such a section is shown in Figure 82, _I_.\r\n\r\n  The body of the leaf is made up of chlorophyll-bearing cells of\r\n  irregular shape and with large air spaces between (_H_, _m_). The\r\n  veins traversing this tissue are fibro-vascular bundles of a type\r\n  structure similar to that of the stem, which will be described\r\n  presently.\r\n\r\n  The stem is made up principally of large cells with thin walls,\r\n  which in cross-section show numerous small, triangular,\r\n  intercellular spaces (_i_) at the angles. These cells contain,\r\n  usually, more or less starch. The fibro-vascular bundles (_C_) are\r\n  nearly triangular in section, and resemble considerably those of the\r\n  field horse-tail, but they are not penetrated by the air channel,\r\n  found in the latter. The xylem, as in the pine, is toward the\r\n  outside of the stem, but the boundary between xylem and phloem is\r\n  not well defined, there being no cambium present. In the xylem are a\r\n  number of vessels (_C_, _tr._) at once distinguishable from the\r\n  other cells by their definite form, firm walls, and empty cavity.\r\n  The vessels in longitudinal sections show spiral and ringed\r\n  thickenings. The rest of the xylem cells, as well as those of the\r\n  phloem, are not noticeably different from the cells of the ground\r\n  tissue, except for their much smaller size, and absence of\r\n  intercellular spaces.\r\n\r\n  The structure of the leaves of the perigone is much like that of the\r\n  green leaves, but the tissues are somewhat reduced. The epidermis of\r\n  the outer side of the sepals has breathing pores, but these are\r\n  absent from their inner surface, and from both sides of the petals.\r\n  The walls of the epidermal cells of the petals are peculiarly\r\n  thickened by apparent infoldings of the wall (_B_), and these cells,\r\n  as well as those below them, contain small, yellow bodies\r\n  (chromoplasts) to which the bright color of the flower is due. The\r\n  red specks on the base of the perigone leaves, as well as the red\r\n  color of the back of the sepals, the stalk, and leaves are due to a\r\n  purplish red cell sap filling the cells at these points.\r\n\r\n  The filaments or stalks of the stamens are made up of very delicate\r\n  colorless cells, and the centre is traversed by a single\r\n  fibro-vascular bundle, which is continued up through the centre of\r\n  the anther. To study the latter, thin cross-sections should be made\r\n  and mounted in water. Each of the four sporangia, or pollen sacs, is\r\n  surrounded on the outside by a wall, consisting of two layers of\r\n  cells, becoming thicker in the middle of the section where the\r\n  single fibro-vascular bundle is seen (Fig. 81, _H_). On opening, the\r\n  cavities of the adjacent sporangia are thrown together. The inner\r\n  cells of the wall are marked by thickened bars, much as we saw in\r\n  the pine (Fig. 82, _A_), and which, like these, are formed shortly\r\n  before the pollen sacs open. The pollen spores (Fig. 81, _I_) are\r\n  large, oval cells, having a double wall, the outer one somewhat\r\n  heavier than the inner one, but sufficiently transparent to allow a\r\n  clear view of the interior, which is filled with very dense,\r\n  granular protoplasm in which may be dimly seen two nuclei (_n_,\r\n  _ni._), showing that here also there is a division of the spore\r\n  contents, although no wall is present. The spores do not germinate\r\n  very readily, and are less favorable for this purpose than those of\r\n  some other monocotyledons. Among the best for this purpose are the\r\n  spiderwort (_Tradescantia_) and _Scilla_.\r\n\r\n  Owing to the large size and consequent opacity of the ovules, as\r\n  well as to the difficulty of getting the early stages, the\r\n  development and finer structure of the ovule will not be discussed\r\n  here. The full-grown ovule may be readily sectioned, and a general\r\n  idea of its structure obtained. A little potash may be used to\r\n  advantage in this study, carefully washing it away when the section\r\n  is sufficiently cleared. We find now that the ovule is attached to a\r\n  stalk (funiculus) (Fig. 81, _G_, _f_), the body of the ovule being\r\n  bent up so as to lie against the stalk. Such an inverted ovule is\r\n  called technically, \"anatropous.\" The ovule is much enlarged where\r\n  the stalk bends. The upper part of the ovule is on the whole like\r\n  that of the pine, but there are two integuments (i, ii) instead of\r\n  the single one found in the pine.\r\n\r\n  As the seed develops, the embryo sac (_G_, _sp._) enlarges so as to\r\n  occupy pretty much the whole space of the seed. At first it is\r\n  nearly filled with a fluid, but a layer of cells is formed, lining\r\n  the walls, and this thickens until the whole space, except what is\r\n  occupied by the small embryo, is filled with them. These are called\r\n  the \"endosperm cells,\" but differ from the endosperm cells of the\r\n  gymnosperms, in the fact that they are not developed until after\r\n  fertilization, and can hardly, therefore, be regarded as\r\n  representing the prothallium of the gymnosperms and pteridophytes.\r\n  These cells finally form a firm tissue, whose cells are filled with\r\n  starch that forms a reserve supply of food for the embryo plant when\r\n  the seed germinates. The embryo (Fig. 81, _K_, _em._, Fig. 82, _J_),\r\n  even when the seed is ripe, remains very small, and shows scarcely\r\n  any differentiation. It is a small, pear-shaped mass of cells, the\r\n  smaller end directed toward the upper end of the embryo sac.\r\n\r\nThe integuments grow with the embryo sac, and become brown and hard,\r\nforming the shell of the seed. The stalk of the ovule also enlarges,\r\nand finally forms the peculiar, spongy appendage of the seeds already\r\nnoticed (Fig. 81, _J_, _K_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE MONOCOTYLEDONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter no attempt will be made to give an exhaustive\r\naccount of the characteristics of each division of the monocotyledons,\r\nbut only such of the most important ones as may serve to supplement\r\nour study of the special one already examined. The classification\r\nhere, and this is the case throughout the spermaphytes, is based\r\nmainly upon the characters of the flowers and fruits.\r\n\r\nThe classification adopted here is that of the German botanist\r\nEichler, and seems to the author to accord better with our present\r\nknowledge of the relationships of the groups than do the systems that\r\nare more general in this country. According to Eichler's\r\nclassification, the monocotyledons may be divided into seven groups;\r\nviz., I. _Liliifloræ_; II. _Enantioblastæ_; III. _Spadicifloræ_;\r\nIV. _Glumaceæ_; V. _Scitamineæ_; VI. _Gynandræ_; VII. _Helobiæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I.--_Liliifloræ_.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this group agree in their general structure with the\r\nadder's-tongue, which is a thoroughly typical representative of the\r\ngroup; but nevertheless, there is much variation among them in the\r\ndetails of structure. While most of them are herbaceous forms (dying\r\ndown to the ground each year), a few, among which may be mentioned the\r\nyuccas (\"bear grass,\" \"Spanish bayonet\") of our southern states,\r\ndevelop a creeping or upright woody stem, increasing in size from year\r\nto year. The herbaceous forms send up their stems yearly from\r\nunderground bulbs, tubers, _e.g._ _Trillium_ (Fig. 83, _A_), or\r\nthickened, creeping stems, or root stocks (rhizomes). Good examples of\r\nthe last are the Solomon's-seal (Fig. 83, _B_), _Medeola_ (_C_, _D_),\r\nand iris (Fig. 84 _A_). One family, the yams (_Dioscoreæ_), of which\r\nwe have one common native species, the wild yam (_Dioscorea villosa_),\r\nhave broad, netted-veined leaves and are twining plants, while another\r\nsomewhat similar family (_Smilaceæ_) climb by means of tendrils at the\r\nbases of the leaves. Of the latter the \"cat-brier\" or \"green-brier\" is\r\na familiar representative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Types of _Liliifloræ_. _A_, _Trillium_, × ¼.\r\n_B_, single flower of Solomon's-seal (_Polygonatum_), × 1. _C_, upper\r\npart of a plant. _D_, underground stem (rhizome) of Indian cucumber\r\nroot (_Medeola_), × ½. _E_, a rush (_Juncus_), × 1. _F_, a single\r\nflower, × 2. _A-D_, _Liliaceæ_; _E_, _Juncaceæ_.]\r\n\r\nThe flowers are for the most part conspicuous, and in plan like that\r\nof the adder's-tongue; but some, like the rushes (Fig. 83, _E_), have\r\nsmall, inconspicuous flowers; and others, like the yams and smilaxes,\r\nhave flowers of two kinds, male and female.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Types of _Liliifloræ_. _A_, flower of the\r\ncommon blue-flag (_Iris_), × ½ (_Iridaceæ_). _B_, the petal-like upper\r\npart of the pistil, seen from below, and showing a stamen (_an._).\r\n_st._ the stigma, × ½. _C_, the young fruit, × ½. _D_, section of the\r\nsame, × 1. _E_, diagram of the flower. _F_, part of a plant of the\r\nso-called \"gray moss\" (_Tillandsia_), × ½ (_Bromeliaceæ_). _G_, a\r\nsingle flower, × 2. _H_, a seed, showing the fine hairs attached to\r\nit, × 1. _I_, plant of pickerel-weed (_Pontederia_), × ¼\r\n(_Pontederiaceæ_). _J_, a single flower, × 1. _K_, section of the\r\novary, × 4.]\r\n\r\nThe principal family of the _Liliifloræ_ is the _Liliaceæ_, including\r\nsome of the most beautiful of all flowers. All of the true lilies\r\n(_Lilium_), as well as the day lilies (_Funkia_, _Hemerocallis_) of\r\nthe gardens, tulips, hyacinths, lily-of-the-valley, etc., belong here,\r\nas well as a number of showy wild flowers including several species of\r\ntiger-lilies (_Lilium_), various species of _Trillium_ (Fig. 83, _A_),\r\nSolomon's-seal (_Polygonatum_) (Fig. 83, _B_), bellwort (_Uvularia_),\r\nand others. In all of these, except _Trillium_, the perigone leaves\r\nare colored alike, and the leaves parallel-veined; but in the latter\r\nthe sepals are green and the leaves broad and netted-veined. The fruit\r\nof the _Liliaceæ_ may be either a pod, like that of the\r\nadder's-tongue, or a berry, like that of asparagus or Solomon's-seal.\r\n\r\nDiffering from the true lilies in having the bases of the perigone\r\nleaves adherent to the surface of the ovary, so that the latter is\r\napparently below the flower (inferior), and lacking the inner circle\r\nof stamens, is the iris family (_Iridaceæ_), represented by the wild\r\nblue-flag (_Iris versicolor_) (Fig. 84, _A_, _E_), as well as by\r\nnumerous cultivated species. In iris the carpels are free above and\r\ncolored like the petals (_B_), with the stigma on the under side. Of\r\ngarden flowers the gladiolus and crocus are the most familiar\r\nexamples, besides the various species of iris; and of wild flowers the\r\nlittle \"blue-eyed grass\" (_Sisyrinchium_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--_Enantioblastæ_. _A_, inflorescence of the\r\ncommon spiderwort (_Tradescantia_), × ½ (_Commelyneæ_). _B_, a single\r\nstamen, showing the hairs attached to the filament, × 2. _C_, the\r\npistil, × 2.]\r\n\r\nThe blue pickerel-weed (_Pontederia_) is the type of a family of which\r\nthere are few common representatives (Fig. 84, _I_, _K_).\r\n\r\nThe last family of the order is the _Bromeliaceæ_, all inhabitants of\r\nthe warmer parts of the globe, but represented in the southern states\r\nby several forms, the commonest of which is the so-called \"gray moss\"\r\n(_Tillandsia_) (Fig. 84, _F_, _H_). Of cultivated plants the pineapple,\r\nwhose fruit consists of a fleshy mass made up of the crowded fruits\r\nand the fleshy flower stalks, is the best known.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II.--_Enantioblastæ_.\r\n\r\nThe second order of the monocotyledons, _Enantioblastæ_, includes very\r\nfew common plants. The most familiar examples are the various species\r\nof _Tradescantia_ (Fig. 88), some of which are native, others exotic.\r\nOf the cultivated forms the commonest is one sometimes called\r\n\"wandering-jew,\" a trailing plant with zigzag stems, and oval, pointed\r\nleaves forming a sheath about each joint. Another common one is the\r\nspiderwort already referred to. In this the leaves are long and\r\npointed, but also sheathing at the base. When the flowers are showy,\r\nas in these, the sepals and petals are different, the former being\r\ngreen. The flowers usually open but once, and the petals shrivel up as\r\nthe flower fades. There are four families of the order, the spiderwort\r\nbelonging to the highest one, _Commelyneæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III.--_Spadicifloræ_.\r\n\r\nThe third order of the monocotyledons, _Spadicifloræ_, is a very large\r\none, and includes the largest and the smallest plants of the whole\r\nsub-class. In all of them the flowers are small and often very\r\ninconspicuous; usually, though not always, the male and female flowers\r\nare separate, and often on different plants. The smallest members of\r\nthe group are little aquatics, scarcely visible to the naked eye, and\r\nof extremely simple structure, but nevertheless these little plants\r\nproduce true flowers. In marked contrast to these are the palms, some\r\nof which reach a height of thirty metres or more.\r\n\r\nThe flowers in most of the order are small and inconspicuous, but\r\naggregated on a spike (spadix) which may be of very large size. Good\r\ntypes of the order are the various aroids (_Aroideæ_), of which the\r\ncalla (_Richardia_) is a very familiar cultivated example. Of wild\r\nforms the sweet-flag (_Acorus_), Jack-in-the-pulpit (_Arisæma_)\r\n(Fig. 86, _A_, _D_), skunk-cabbage (_Symplocarpus_), and wild calla\r\nmay be noted. In _Arisæma_ (Fig. 86, _A_) the flowers are borne only\r\non the base of the spadix, and the plant is diœcious. The flowers are\r\nof the simplest structure, the female consisting of a single carpel,\r\nand the male of four stamens (_C_, _D_). While the individual flowers\r\nare destitute of a perigone, the whole inflorescence (cluster of\r\nflowers) is surrounded by a large leaf (spathe), which sometimes is\r\nbrilliantly colored, this serving to attract insects. The leaves of\r\nthe aroids are generally large and sometimes compound, the only\r\ninstance of true compound leaves among the monocotyledons (Fig. 86,\r\n_B_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Types of _Spadicifloræ_. _A_, inflorescence\r\nof Jack-in-the-pulpit (_Arisæma_, _Aroideæ_).

They are\r\nglobular or discoid masses of cells, most of them having roots; but\r\none genus (_Wolffia_) has no roots nor any trace of fibro-vascular\r\nbundles. The flowers are reduced to a single stamen or carpel (Figs.\r\n_E_, _G_, _H_).\r\n\r\nThe cat-tail (_Typha_) and bur-reed (_Sparganium_) (Fig. 86, _I_, _L_)\r\nare common representatives of the family _Typhaceæ_, and the\r\npond-weeds (_Naias_ and _Potomogeton_) are common examples of the\r\nfamily _Naiadeæ_. These are aquatic plants, completely submerged\r\n(_Naias_), or sometimes partially floating (_Potomogeton_). The latter\r\ngenus includes a number of species with leaves varying from linear\r\n(very narrow and pointed) to broadly oval, and are everywhere common\r\nin slow streams.\r\n\r\nThe largest members of the group are the screw-pines (_Pandaneæ_) and\r\nthe palms (_Palmæ_). These are represented in the United States by\r\nonly a few species of the latter family, confined to the southern and\r\nsouthwestern portions. The palmettoes (_Sabal_ and _Chamærops_) are\r\nthe best known.\r\n\r\nBoth the palms and screw-pines are often cultivated for ornament, and\r\nas is well known, in the warmer parts of the world the palms are among\r\nthe most valuable of all plants. The date palm (_Phœnix dactylifera_)\r\nand the cocoanut (_Cocos nucifera_) are the best known. The apparently\r\ncompound (\"pinnate\" or feather-shaped) leaves of many palms are not\r\nstrictly compound; that is, they do not arise from the branching of an\r\noriginally single leaf, but are really broad, undivided leaves, which\r\nare closely folded like a fan in the bud, and tear apart along the\r\nfolds as the leaf opens.\r\n\r\nAlthough these plants reach such a great size, an examination of the\r\nstem shows that it is built on much the same plan as that of the other\r\nmonocotyledons; that is, the stem is composed of a mass of soft,\r\nground tissue through which run many small isolated, fibro-vascular\r\nbundles. A good idea of this structure may be had by cutting across a\r\ncorn-stalk, which is built on precisely the same pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER IV.--_Glumaceæ_.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this order resemble each other closely in their habit,\r\nall having long, narrow leaves with sheathing bases that surround the\r\nslender, distinctly jointed stem which frequently has a hard, polished\r\nsurface. The flowers are inconspicuous, borne usually in close spikes,\r\nand destitute of a perigone or having this reduced to small scales or\r\nhairs. The flowers are usually surrounded by more or less dry leaves\r\n(glumes, paleæ) which are closely set, so as to nearly conceal the\r\nflowers. The flowers are either hermaphrodite or unisexual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Types of _Glumaceæ_. _A_, a sedge, _Carex_\r\n(_Cyperaceæ_). ♂, the male; ♀, the female flowers, × ½. _B_, a single\r\nmale flower, × 2. _C_, a female flower, × 2. _D_, fruiting spike of\r\nanother _Carex_, × ½. _E_, a single fruit, × 1. _F_, the same, with\r\nthe outer envelope removed, and slightly enlarged. _G_, section of\r\n_F_, × 3. _em._ the embryo. _H_, a bulrush, _Scirpus_ (_Cyperaceæ_),\r\n× ½. _I_, a single spikelet, × 2. _J_, a single flower, × 3. _K_, a\r\nspikelet of flowers of the common orchard grass, _Dactylis_\r\n(_Gramineæ_), × 2. _L_, a single flower, × 2. _M_, the base of a leaf,\r\nshowing the split sheath encircling the stem, × 1. _N_, section of a\r\nkernel of corn, showing the embryo (_em._), × 2.]\r\n\r\nThere are two well-marked families, the sedges (_Cyperaceæ_) and the\r\ngrasses (_Gramineæ_). The former have solid, often triangular stems,\r\nand the sheath at the base of the leaves is not split. The commonest\r\ngenera are _Carex_ (Fig. 87, _A_, _G_) and _Cyperus_, of which there\r\nare many common species, differing very little and hard to\r\ndistinguish. There are several common species of _Carex_ which blossom\r\nearly in the spring, the male flowers being quite conspicuous on\r\naccount of the large, yellow anthers. The female flowers are in\r\nsimilar spikes lower down, where the pollen readily falls upon them,\r\nand is caught by the long stigmas. In some other genera, _e.g._ the\r\nbulrushes (_Scirpus_) (Fig. 87, _H_), the flowers are hermaphrodite,\r\n_i.e._ contain both stamens and pistils. The fruit (Fig. 87, _F_) is\r\nseed-like, but really includes the wall of the ovary as well, which is\r\ngrown closely to the enclosed seed. The embryo is small, surrounded by\r\nabundant endosperm (Fig. 87, _G_). Very few of the sedges are of any\r\neconomic importance, though one, the papyrus of Egypt, was formerly\r\nmuch valued for its pith, which was manufactured into paper.\r\n\r\nThe second family, the grasses, on the contrary, includes the most\r\nimportant of all food plants, all of the grains belonging here. They\r\ndiffer mainly from the sedges in having, generally, hollow,\r\ncylindrical stems, and the sheath of the leaves split down one side;\r\nthe leaves are in two rows, while those of the sedges are in three.\r\nThe flowers (Fig. 87, _L_) are usually perfect; the stigmas, two in\r\nnumber and like plumes, so that they readily catch the pollen which is\r\nblown upon them. A few, like the Indian corn, have the flowers\r\nunisexual; the male flowers are at the top of the stem forming the\r\n\"tassel,\" and the female flowers lower down forming the ear. The\r\n\"silk\" is composed of the enormously lengthened stigmas. The fruits\r\nresemble those of the sedges, but the embryo is usually larger and\r\nplaced at one side of the endosperm (_N_, _em._).\r\n\r\nWhile most of the grasses are comparatively small plants, a few of\r\nthem are almost tree-like in their proportions, the species of bamboo\r\n(_Bambusa_) sometimes reaching a height of twenty to thirty metres,\r\nwith stems thirty to forty centimetres in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER V.--_Scitamineæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--_Scitamineæ_. _A_, upper part of a flowering\r\nplant of Indian shot (_Canna_), much reduced in size (_Cannaceæ_).\r\n_B_, a single flower, × ½. _C_, the single stamen (_an._), and\r\npetal-like pistil (_gy._), × 1. _D_, section of the ovary, × 2. _E_,\r\ndiagram of the flower. The place of the missing stamens is indicated\r\nby small circles. _F_, fruit, × ½. _G_, section of an unripe seed.\r\n_em._ embryo. _p_, perisperm, × 2.]\r\n\r\nThe plants of this order are all inhabitants of the warmer parts of\r\nthe earth, and only a very few occur within the limits of the United\r\nStates, and these confined to the extreme south. They are extremely\r\nshowy plants, owing to their large leaves and brilliant flowers, and\r\nfor this reason are cultivated extensively. Various species of _Canna_\r\n(Fig. 88) are common in gardens, where they are prized for their\r\nlarge, richly-colored leaves, and clusters of scarlet, orange, or\r\nyellow flowers. The leafy stems arise from thick tubers or root\r\nstocks, and grow rapidly to a height of two metres or more in the\r\nlarger species. The leaves, as in all the order, are very large, and\r\nhave a thick midrib with lateral veins running to the margin. The\r\nyoung leaves are folded up like a trumpet. The flowers are irregular\r\nin form, and in _Canna_ only a single stamen is found; or if more are\r\npresent, they are reduced to petal-like rudiments. The single, perfect\r\nstamen (Fig. 88, _C_, _an._) has the filament broad and colored like\r\nthe petals, and the anther attached to one side. The pistil (_gy._) is\r\nalso petal-like. There are three circles of leaves forming the\r\nperigone, the two outer being more or less membranaceous, and only the\r\nthree inner petal-like in texture. The ovary (_o_) is inferior, and\r\ncovered on the outside with little papillæ that afterward form short\r\nspines on the outside of the fruit (_F_).\r\n\r\nThe seeds are large, but the embryo is very small. A section of a\r\nnearly ripe seed shows the embryo (_em._) occupying the upper part of\r\nthe embryo sac which does not nearly fill the seed and contains no\r\nendosperm. The bulk of the seed is derived from the tissue of the body\r\nof the ovule, which in most seeds becomes entirely obliterated by the\r\ngrowth of the embryo sac. The cells of this tissue become filled with\r\nstarch, and serve the same purpose as the endosperm of other seeds.\r\nThis tissue is called \"perisperm.\"\r\n\r\nOf food plants belonging to this order, the banana (_Musa_) is much\r\nthe most important. Others of more or less value are species of\r\narrowroot (_Maranta_) and ginger (_Zingiber_).\r\n\r\nThere are three families: I. _Musaceæ_ (banana family);\r\nII. _Zingiberaceæ_ (ginger family); and III. _Cannaceæ_ (_Canna_,\r\n_Maranta_).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER VI.--_Gynandræ_.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of the plants of this order belong to the\r\norchis family (_Orchideæ_), the second family of the order\r\n(_Apostasieæ_), being a small one and unrepresented in the United\r\nStates. The orchids are in some respects the most highly specialized\r\nof all flowers, and exhibit wonderful variety in the shape and color\r\nof the flowers, which are often of extraordinary beauty, and show\r\nspecial contrivances for cross-fertilization that are without parallel\r\namong flowering plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--_Gynandræ_. _A_, inflorescence of the showy\r\norchis (_Orchis spectabilis_), × 1 (_Orchideæ_). _B_, a single flower,\r\nwith the upper leaves of the perianth turned back to show the column\r\n(_x_). _sp._ the spur attached to the lower petal or lip. _o_, the\r\novary, × 1. _C_, the column seen from in front. _an._ the stamen.\r\n_gy._ the stigmatic surface, × 1. _D_, the two pollen masses attached\r\nto a straw, which was inserted into the flower, by means of the viscid\r\ndisc (_d_): i, the masses immediately after their withdrawal; ii, iii,\r\nthe same a few minutes later, showing the change in position. _E_,\r\ndiagram of the flower; the position of the missing stamens indicated\r\nby small circles.]\r\n\r\nThe flowers are always more or less bilaterally symmetrical\r\n(zygomorphic). The ovary is inferior, and usually twisted so as to\r\nturn the flower completely around. There are two sets of perigone\r\nleaves, three in each, and these are usually much alike except the\r\nlower (through the twisting of the ovary) of the inner set. This\r\npetal, known as the \"lip\" or \"labellum,\" is usually larger than the\r\nothers, and different in color, as well as being frequently of\r\npeculiar shape. In many of them it is also prolonged backward in a\r\nhollow spur (see Fig. 89, _B_). In all of the orchids except the\r\nlady's-slippers (_Cypripedium_) (Fig. 90, _B_), only one perfect\r\nstamen is developed, and this is united with the three styles to form\r\na special structure known, as the \"column\" or \"gynostemium\" (Fig. 89,\r\n_B_, _C_). The pollen spores are usually aggregated into two or four\r\nwaxy masses (\"pollinia,\" sing. pollinium), which usually can only be\r\nremoved by the agency of insects upon which all but a very few orchids\r\nare absolutely dependent for the pollination of the flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Forms of _Orchideæ_. _A_, putty-root\r\n(_Aplectrum_), × 1. _B_, yellow lady's-slipper (_Cypripedium_), × ½.\r\n_C_, the column of the same, × 1. _an._ one of the two perfect\r\nstamens. _st._ sterile, petal-like stamen. _gy._. stigma. _D_,\r\n_Arethusa_, × ½. _E_, section of the column, × 1: _an._ stamen. _gy._\r\nstigma. _F_, the same, seen from in front. _G_, _Habenaria_, × 1. _H_,\r\n_Calopogon_, × 1. In the last the ovary is not twisted, so that the\r\nlip (_L_) lies on the upper side of the flower.]\r\n\r\nIn the lady-slippers there are two fertile stamens, and a third\r\nsterile one has the form of a large triangular shield terminating the\r\ncolumn (Fig. 90, _C_, _st._).\r\n\r\nThe ovules of the orchids are extremely small, and are only partly\r\ndeveloped at the time the flower opens, the pollen tube growing very\r\nslowly and the ovules maturing as it grows down through the tissues of\r\nthe column. The ripe seeds are excessively numerous, but so fine as to\r\nlook like dust.\r\n\r\nThe orchids are mostly small or moderate-sized plants, few of them\r\nbeing more than a metre or so in height. All of our native species,\r\nwith the exception of a few from the extreme south, grow from fibrous\r\nroots or tubers, but many tropical orchids, as is well known, are\r\n\"epiphytes\"; that is, they grow upon the trunks and branches of trees.\r\nOne genus, _Vanilla_, is a twining epiphyte; the fruit of this plant\r\nfurnishes the vanilla of commerce. Aside from this plant, the\r\neconomical value of the orchids is small, although a few of them are\r\nused medicinally, but are not specially valuable.\r\n\r\nOf the five thousand species known, the great majority are inhabitants\r\nof the tropics, but nevertheless there are within the United States a\r\nnumber of very beautiful forms. The largest and showiest are the\r\nlady's-slippers, of which we have six species at the north. The most\r\nbeautiful is the showy lady's-slipper (_Cypripedium spectabile_),\r\nwhose large, pink and white flowers rival in beauty many of the\r\nchoicest tropical orchids. Many of the _Habenarias_, including the\r\nyellow and purple fringed orchids, are strikingly beautiful as are the\r\n_Arethuseæ_ (_Arethusa_, _Pogonia_, _Calopogon_). The last of these\r\n(Fig. 90, _H_) differs from all our other native orchids in having the\r\novary untwisted so that the labellum lies on the upper side of the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nA number of the orchids are saprophytic, growing in soil rich in\r\ndecaying vegetable matter, and these forms are often nearly or quite\r\ndestitute of chlorophyll, being brownish or yellowish in color, and\r\nwith rudimentary leaves. The coral roots (_Corallorhiza_), of which\r\nthere are several species, are examples of these, and another closely\r\nrelated form, the putty-root (_Aplectrum_) (Fig. 90, _A_), has the\r\nflowering stems like those of _Corallorhiza_, but there is a single,\r\nlarge, plaited leaf sent up later.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER VII.--_Helobiæ_.\r\n\r\nThe last order of the monocotyledons is composed of marsh or water\r\nplants, some of which recall certain of the dicotyledons. Of the three\r\nfamilies, the first, _Juncagineæ_, includes a few inconspicuous plants\r\nwith grass-like or rush-like leaves, and small, greenish or yellowish\r\nflowers (_e.g._ arrow-grass, _Triglochin_).\r\n\r\nThe second family (_Alismaceæ_) contains several large and showy\r\nspecies, inhabitants of marshes. Of these the water-plantain\r\n(_Alisma_), a plant with long-stalked, oval, ribbed leaves, and a\r\nmuch-branched panicle of small, white flowers, is very common in\r\nmarshes and ditches, and the various species of arrowhead\r\n(_Sagittaria_) are among the most characteristic of our marsh plants.\r\nThe flowers are unisexual; the female flowers are usually borne at the\r\nbase of the inflorescence, and the male flowers above. The gynœcium\r\n(Fig. 91, _B_) consists of numerous, separate carpels attached to a\r\nglobular receptacle. The sepals are green and much smaller than the\r\nwhite petals. The leaves (_F_) are broad, and, besides the thickened,\r\nparallel veins, have numerous smaller ones connecting these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Types of _Helobiæ_. _A_, inflorescence of\r\narrowhead (_Sagittaria_), with a single female flower, × ½\r\n(_Alismaceæ_). _B_, section through the gynœcium, showing the numerous\r\nsingle carpels, × 3. _C_, a ripe fruit, × 3. _D_, a male flower, × 1.\r\n_E_, a single stamen, × 3. _F_, a leaf of _Sagittaria variabilis_,\r\n× ⅙. _G_, ditch-moss (_Elodea_), with a female flower (_fl._), × ½.\r\n(_Hydrocharideæ_). _H_, the flower, × 2. _an._ the rudimentary\r\nstamens. _st._ the stigma. _I_, cross-section of the ovary, × 4. _J_,\r\nmale inflorescence of eel-grass (_Vallisneria_), × 1. _K_, a single\r\nexpanded male flower, × 12. _st._ the stamen. _L_, a female flower,\r\n× 1. _gy._ the stigma.]\r\n\r\nThe last family is the _Hydrocharideæ_. They are submersed aquatics,\r\nor a few of them with long-stalked, floating leaves. Two forms, the\r\nditch-moss (_Elodea_) (Fig. 91, _G_, _I_) and eel-grass\r\n(_Vallisneria_) are very common in stagnant or slow-running water. In\r\nboth of these the plants are completely submersed, but there is a\r\nspecial arrangement for bringing the flowers to the surface of the\r\nwater. Like the arrowhead, the flowers are unisexual, but borne on\r\ndifferent plants. The female flowers (_H_, _L_) are comparatively\r\nlarge, especially in _Vallisneria_, and are borne on long stalks, by\r\nmeans of which they reach the surface of the water, where they expand\r\nand are ready for pollination. The male flowers (Fig. 91, _J_, _K_)\r\nare extremely small and borne, many together, surrounded by a\r\nmembranous envelope, the whole inflorescence attached by a short\r\nstalk. When the flowers are ready to open, they break away from their\r\nattachment, and the envelope opens, allowing them to escape, and they\r\nimmediately rise to the surface where they expand and collect in great\r\nnumbers about the open female flowers. Sometimes these are so abundant\r\nduring the flowering period (late in summer) that the surface of the\r\nwater looks as if flour had been scattered over it. After pollination\r\nis effected, the stem of the female flower coils up like a spring,\r\ndrawing the flower beneath the water where the fruit ripens.\r\n\r\nThe cells of these plants show very beautifully the circulation of the\r\nprotoplasm, the movement being very marked and continuing for a long\r\ntime under the microscope. To see this the whole leaf of _Elodea_, or\r\na section of that of _Vallisneria_, may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nDICOTYLEDONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second sub-class of the angiosperms, the dicotyledons, receive\r\ntheir name from the two opposite seed leaves or cotyledons with which\r\nthe young plant is furnished. These leaves are usually quite different\r\nin shape from the other leaves, and not infrequently are very thick\r\nand fleshy, filling nearly the whole seed, as may be seen in a bean or\r\npea. The number of the dicotyledons is very large, and very much the\r\ngreater number of living spermaphytes belong to this group. They\r\nexhibit much greater variety in the structure of the flowers than the\r\nmonocotyledons, and the leaves, which in the latter are with few\r\nexceptions quite uniform in structure, show here almost infinite\r\nvariety. Thus the leaves may be simple (undivided); _e.g._ oak, apple;\r\nor compound, as in clover, locust, rose, columbine, etc. The leaves\r\nmay be stalked or sessile (attached directly to the stem), or even\r\ngrown around the stem, as in some honeysuckles. The edges of the\r\nleaves may be perfectly smooth (\"entire\"), or they may be variously\r\nlobed, notched, or wavy in many ways. As many of the dicotyledons are\r\ntrees or shrubs that lose their leaves annually, special leaves are\r\ndeveloped for the protection of the young leaves during the winter.\r\nThese have the form of thick scales, and often are provided with\r\nglands secreting a gummy substance which helps render them\r\nwater-proof. These scales are best studied in trees with large, winter\r\nbuds, such as the horsechestnut (Fig. 92), hickory, lilac, etc. On\r\nremoving the hard, scale leaves, the delicate, young leaves, and often\r\nthe flowers, may be found within the bud. If we examine a young shoot\r\nof lilac or buckeye, just as the leaves are expanding in the spring, a\r\ncomplete series of forms may be seen from the simple, external scales,\r\nthrough immediate forms, to the complete foliage leaf. The veins of\r\nthe leaves are almost always much-branched, the veins either being\r\ngiven off from one main vein or midrib (feather-veined or\r\npinnate-veined), as in an apple leaf, or there may be a number of\r\nlarge veins radiating from the base of the leaf, as in the scarlet\r\ngeranium or mallow. Such leaves are said to be palmately veined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--End of a branch of a horsechestnut in winter,\r\nshowing the buds covered by the thick, brown scale leaves, × 1.]\r\n\r\nSome of them are small herbaceous plants, either upright or prostrate\r\nupon the ground, over which they may creep extensively, becoming\r\nrooted at intervals, as in the white clover, or sending out special\r\nrunners, as is seen in the strawberry. Others are woody stemmed\r\nplants, persisting from year to year, and often becoming great trees\r\nthat live for hundreds of years. Still others are climbing plants,\r\neither twining their stems about the support, like the morning-glory,\r\nhop, honeysuckle, and many others, or having special organs (tendrils)\r\nby which they fasten themselves to the support. These tendrils\r\noriginate in different ways. Sometimes, as in the grape and Virginia\r\ncreeper, they are reduced branches, either coiling about the support,\r\nor producing little suckers at their tips by which they cling to walls\r\nor the trunks of trees. Other tendrils, as in the poison ivy and the\r\ntrue ivy, are short roots that fasten themselves firmly in the\r\ncrevices of bark or stones. Still other tendrils, as those of the\r\nsweet-pea and clematis, are parts of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThe stems may be modified into thorns for protection, as we see in\r\nmany trees and shrubs, and parts of leaves may be similarly changed,\r\nas in the thistle. The underground stems often become much changed,\r\nforming bulbs, tubers, root stocks, etc. much as in the\r\nmonocotyledons. These structures are especially found in plants which\r\ndie down to the ground each year, and contain supplies of nourishment\r\nfor the rapid growth of the annual shoots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--_A_, base of a plant of shepherd's-purse\r\n(_Capsella bursa-pastoris_), × ½. _r_, the main root. _B_, upper part\r\nof the inflorescence, × 1. _C_, two leaves: i, from the upper part;\r\nii, from the base of the plant, × 1. _D_, a flower, × 3. _E_, the\r\nsame, with sepals and petals removed, × 3. _F_, petal. _G_, sepal.\r\n_H_, stamen, × 10. _f_, filament. _an._ anther. _I_, a fruit with one\r\nof the valves removed to show the seeds, × 4. _J_, longitudinal\r\nsection of a seed, × 8. _K_, the embryo removed from the seed, × 8.\r\n_l_, the first leaves (cotyledons). _st._ the stem ending in the root.\r\n_L_, cross-section of the stem, × 20. _fb._ fibro-vascular bundle.\r\n_M_, a similar section of the main root, × 15. _N_, diagram of the\r\nflower.]\r\n\r\nThe structure of the tissues, and the peculiarities of the flower and\r\nfruit, will be better understood by a somewhat careful examination of\r\na typical dicotyledon, and a comparison with this of examples of the\r\nprincipal orders and families.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest of weeds, and at the same time one of the most\r\nconvenient plants for studying the characteristics of the\r\ndicotyledons, is the common shepherd's-purse (_Capsella\r\nbursa-pastoris_) (Figs. 93-95).\r\n\r\nThe plant grows abundantly in waste places, and is in flower nearly\r\nthe year round, sometimes being found in flower in midwinter, after a\r\nweek or two of warm weather. It is, however, in best condition for\r\nstudy in the spring and early summer. The plant may at once be\r\nrecognized by the heart-shaped pods and small, white, four-petaled\r\nflowers. The plant begins to flower when very small, but continues to\r\ngrow until it forms a much-branching plant, half a metre or more in\r\nheight. On pulling up the plant, a large tap-root (Fig. 93, _A_, _r_)\r\nis seen, continuous with the main stem above ground. The first root of\r\nthe seedling plant continues here as the main root of the plant, as\r\nwas the case with the gymnosperms, but not with the monocotyledons.\r\nFrom this tap-root other small ones branch off, and these divide\r\nrepeatedly, forming a complex root system. The main root is very tough\r\nand hard, owing to the formation of woody tissue in it. A\r\ncross-section slightly magnified (Fig. 93, _M_), shows a round,\r\nopaque, white, central area (_x_), the wood, surrounded by a more\r\ntransparent, irregular ring (_ph._), the phloem or bast; and outside\r\nof this is the ground tissue and epidermis.\r\n\r\nThe lower leaves are crowded into a rosette, and are larger than those\r\nhigher up, from which they differ also in having a stalk (petiole),\r\nwhile the upper leaves are sessile. The outline of the leaves varies\r\nmuch in different plants and in different parts of the same plant,\r\nbeing sometimes almost entire, sometimes divided into lobes almost to\r\nthe midrib, and between these extremes all gradations are found. The\r\nlarger leaves are traversed by a strong midrib projecting strongly on\r\nthe lower side of the leaf, and from this the smaller veins branch.\r\nThe upper leaves have frequently two smaller veins starting from the\r\nbase of the leaf, and nearly parallel with the midrib (_C_ i). The\r\nsurface of the leaves is somewhat roughened with hairs, some of which,\r\nif slightly magnified, look like little white stars.\r\n\r\nMagnifying slightly a thin cross-section of the stem, it shows a\r\ncentral, ground tissue (pith), whose cells are large enough to be seen\r\neven when very slightly enlarged. Surrounding this is a ring of\r\nfibro-vascular bundles (_L_, _fb._), appearing white and opaque, and\r\nconnected by a more transparent tissue. Outside of the ring of\r\nfibro-vascular bundles is the green ground tissue and epidermis.\r\nComparing this with the section of the seedling pine stem, a\r\nresemblance is at once evident, and this arrangement was also noticed\r\nin the stem of the horse-tail.\r\n\r\nBranches are given off from the main stem, arising at the point where\r\nthe leaves join the stem (axils of the leaves), and these may in turn\r\nbranch. All the branches terminate finally in an elongated\r\ninflorescence, and the separate flowers are attached to the main axis\r\nof the inflorescence by short stalks. This form of inflorescence is\r\nknown technically as a \"raceme.\" Each flower is really a short branch\r\nfrom which the floral leaves arise in precisely the same way as the\r\nfoliage leaves do from the ordinary branches. There are five sets of\r\nfloral leaves: I. four outer perigone leaves (sepals) (_F_), small,\r\ngreen, pointed leaves traversed by three simple veins, and together\r\nforming the calyx; II. four larger, white, inner perigone leaves\r\n(petals) (_G_), broad and slightly notched at the end, and tapering to\r\nthe point of attachment. The petals collectively are known as the\r\n\"corolla.\" The veins of the petals fork once; III. and IV. two sets of\r\nstamens (_E_), the outer containing two short, and the inner, four\r\nlonger ones arranged in pairs. Each stamen has a slender filament\r\n(_H_, _f_) and a two-lobed anther (_an._). The innermost set consists\r\nof two carpels united into a compound pistil. The ovary is oblong,\r\nslightly flattened so as to be oval in section, and divided into two\r\nchambers. The style is very short and tipped by a round, flattened\r\nstigma.\r\n\r\nThe raceme continues to grow for a long time, forming new flowers at\r\nthe end, so that all stages of flowers and fruit may often be found in\r\nthe same inflorescence.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are probably quite independent of insect aid in\r\npollination, as the stamens are so placed as to almost infallibly shed\r\ntheir pollen upon the stigma. This fact, probably, accounts for the\r\ninconspicuous character of the flowers.\r\n\r\nAfter fertilization is effected, and the outer floral leaves fall off,\r\nthe ovary rapidly enlarges, and becomes heart-shaped and much\r\nflattened at right angles to the partition. When ripe, each half falls\r\naway, leaving the seeds attached by delicate stalks (funiculi, sing.\r\nfuniculus) to the edges of the membranous partition. The seeds are\r\nsmall, oval bodies with a shining, yellow-brown shell, and with a\r\nlittle dent at the end where the stalk is attached. Carefully dividing\r\nthe seed lengthwise, or crushing it in water so as to remove the\r\nembryo, we find it occupies the whole cavity of the seed, the young\r\nstalk (_st._) being bent down against the back of one of the\r\ncotyledons (_f_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--_A_, cross-section of the stem of the\r\nshepherd's-purse, including a fibro-vascular bundle, × 150. _ep._\r\nepidermis. _m_, ground tissue. _sh._ bundle sheath. _ph._ phloem.\r\n_xy._ xylem. _tr._ a vessel. _B_, a young root seen in optical\r\nsection, × 150. _r_, root cap. _d_, young epidermis. _pb._ ground.\r\n_pl._ young fibro-vascular bundle. _C_ cross section of a small root,\r\n× 150. _fb._ fibro-vascular bundle. _D_, epidermis from the lower side\r\nof the leaf, × 150. _E_, a star-shaped hair from the surface of the\r\nleaf, × 150. _F_, cross-section of a leaf, × 150. _ep._ epidermis.\r\n_m_, ground tissue. _fb._ section of a vein.]\r\n\r\n  A microscopic examination of a cross-section of the older root shows\r\n  that the central portion is made up of radiating lines of\r\n  thick-walled cells (fibres) interspersed with lines of larger, round\r\n  openings (vessels). There is a ring of small cambium cells around\r\n  this merging into the phloem, which is composed of irregular cells,\r\n  with pretty thick, but soft walls. The ground tissue is composed of\r\n  large, loose cells, which in the older roots are often ruptured and\r\n  partly dried up. The epidermis is usually indistinguishable in the\r\n  older roots. To understand the early structure of the roots, the\r\n  smallest rootlets obtainable should be selected. The smallest are so\r\n  transparent that the tips may be mounted whole in water, and will\r\n  show very satisfactorily the arrangement of the young tissues. The\r\n  tissues do not here arise from a single, apical cell, as we found in\r\n  the pteridophytes, but from a group of cells (the shaded cells in\r\n  Fig. 94, _B_). The end of the root, as in the fern, is covered with\r\n  a root cap (_r_) composed of successive layers of cells cut off from\r\n  the growing point. The rest of the root shows the same division of\r\n  the tissues into the primary epidermis (dermatogen) (_d_), young\r\n  fibro-vascular cylinder (plerome) (_pl._), and young ground tissue\r\n  (periblem) (_pb._). The structure of the older portions of such\r\n  a root is not very easy to study, owing to difficulty in making\r\n  good cross-sections of so small an object. By using a very\r\n  sharp razor, and holding perfectly straight between pieces of pith,\r\n  however, satisfactory sections can be made. The cells contain so\r\n  much starch as to make them almost opaque, and potash should be used\r\n  to clear them. The fibro-vascular bundle is of the radial type,\r\n  there being two masses of xylem (_xy._) joined in the middle, and\r\n  separating the two phloem masses (_ph._), some of whose cells are\r\n  rather thicker walled than the others. The bundle sheath is not so\r\n  plain here as in the fern. The ground tissue is composed of\r\n  comparatively large cells with thickish, soft walls, that contain\r\n  much starch. The epidermis usually dies while the root is still\r\n  young. In the larger roots the early formation of the cambium ring,\r\n  and the irregular arrangement of the tissues derived from its\r\n  growth, soon obliterate all traces of the primitive arrangement of\r\n  the tissues. Making a thin cross-section of the stem, and magnifying\r\n  strongly, we find bounding the section a single row of epidermal\r\n  cells (Fig. 94, _A_, _ep._) whose walls, especially the outer ones,\r\n  are strongly thickened. Within these are several rows of thin-walled\r\n  ground-tissue cells containing numerous small, round chloroplasts.\r\n  The innermost row of these cells (_sh._) are larger and have but\r\n  little chlorophyll. This row of cells forms a sheath around the ring\r\n  of fibro-vascular bundles very much as is the case in the\r\n  horse-tail. The separate bundles are nearly triangular in outline,\r\n  the point turned inward, and are connected with each other by masses\r\n  of fibrous tissue (_f_), whose thickened walls have a peculiar,\r\n  silvery lustre. Just inside of the bundle sheath there is a row of\r\n  similar fibres marking the outer limit of the phloem (_ph._). The\r\n  rest of the phloem is composed of very small cells. The xylem is\r\n  composed of fibrous cells with yellowish walls and numerous large\r\n  vessels (_tr._). The central ground tissue (pith) has large,\r\n  thin-walled cells with numerous intercellular spaces, as in the stem\r\n  of _Erythronium_. Some of these cells contain a few scattered\r\n  chloroplasts in the very thin, protoplasmic layer lining their\r\n  walls, but the cells are almost completely filled with colorless\r\n  cell sap.\r\n\r\n  A longitudinal section shows that the epidermal cells are much\r\n  elongated, the cells of the ground tissue less so, and in both the\r\n  partition walls are straight. In the fibrous cells, both of the\r\n  fibro-vascular bundle and those lying between, the end walls are\r\n  strongly oblique. The tracheary tissue of the xylem is made up of\r\n  small, spirally-marked vessels, and larger ones with thickened\r\n  rings or with pits in the walls. The small, spirally-marked vessels\r\n  are nearest the centre, and are the first to be formed in the young\r\n  bundle.\r\n\r\n  The epidermis of the leaves is composed of irregular cells with wavy\r\n  outlines like those of the ferns. Breathing pores, of the same type\r\n  as those in the ferns and monocotyledons, are found on both\r\n  surfaces, but more abundant and more perfectly developed on the\r\n  lower surface of the leaf. Owing to their small size they are not\r\n  specially favorable for study. The epidermis is sparingly covered\r\n  with unicellular hairs, some of which are curiously branched, being\r\n  irregularly star-shaped. The walls of these cells are very thick,\r\n  and have little protuberances upon the outer surface (Fig. 93, _E_).\r\n\r\n  Cross-sections of the leaf may be made between pith as already\r\n  directed; or, by folding the leaf carefully several times, the whole\r\n  can be easily sectioned. The structure is essentially as in the\r\n  adder-tongue, but the epidermal cells appear more irregular, and the\r\n  fibro-vascular bundles are better developed. They are like those of\r\n  the stem, but somewhat simpler. The xylem lies on the upper side.\r\n\r\n  The ground tissue is composed, as in the leaves we have studied, of\r\n  chlorophyll-bearing, loose cells, rather more compact upon the upper\r\n  side. (In the majority of dicotyledons the upper surface of the\r\n  leaves is nearly or quite destitute of breathing pores, and the\r\n  cells of the ground tissue below the upper epidermis are closely\r\n  packed, forming what is called the \"palisade-parenchyma\" of the\r\n  leaf.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--_A-D_, successive stages in the development\r\nof the flower of _Capsella_, × 50. _A_, surface view. _B-D_, optical\r\nsections. _s_, sepals, _p_, petals. _an._ stamens. _gy._ pistil. _E_,\r\ncross-section of the young anther, × 180. _sp._ spore mother cells.\r\n_F_, cross-section of full-grown anther. _sp._ pollen spores, × 50.\r\n_Fʹ_, four young pollen spores, × 300. _Fʺ_, pollen spores germinating\r\nupon the stigma, × 300. _pt._ pollen tube. _G_, young pistil in\r\noptical section, × 25.

To study this, it is only necessary to teaze out, in a\r\n  drop of water, the tip of a raceme, and putting on a cover glass,\r\n  examine with a power of from fifty to a hundred diameters. In the\r\n  older stages it is best to treat with potash, which will render the\r\n  young flowers quite transparent. The young flower (Fig. 95, _A_) is\r\n  at first a little protuberance composed of perfectly similar small\r\n  cells filled with dense protoplasm. The first of the floral leaves\r\n  to appear are the sepals which very early arise as four little buds\r\n  surrounding the young flower axis (Fig. 95, _A_, _B_). The stamens\r\n  (_C_, _an._) next appear, being at first entirely similar to the\r\n  young sepals. The petals do not appear until the other parts of the\r\n  flower have reached some size, and the first tracheary tissue\r\n  appears in the fibro-vascular bundle of the flower stalk (_D_). The\r\n  carpels are more or less united from the first, and form at first a\r\n  sort of shallow cup with the edges turned in (_D_, _gy._). This cup\r\n  rapidly elongates, and the cavity enlarges, becoming completely\r\n  closed at the top where the short style and stigma develop. The\r\n  ovules arise in two lines on the inner face of each carpel, and the\r\n  tissue which bears them (placenta) grows out into the cavity of the\r\n  ovary until the two placentæ meet in the middle and form a partition\r\n  completely across the ovary (Fig. 95, _H_).\r\n\r\n  The stamens soon show the differentiation into filament and anther,\r\n  but the former remains very short until immediately before the\r\n  flowers are ready to open. The anther develops four sporangia\r\n  (pollen sacs), the process being very similar to that in such\r\n  pteridophytes as the club mosses. Each sporangium (Fig. _E_, _F_)\r\n  contains a central mass of spore mother cells, and a wall of three\r\n  layers of cells. The spore mother cells finally separate, and the\r\n  inner layer of the wall cells becomes absorbed much as we saw in\r\n  the fern, and the mass of mother cells thus floats free in the\r\n  cavity of the sporangium. Each one now divides in precisely the same\r\n  way as in the ferns and gymnosperms, into four pollen spores. The\r\n  anther opens as described for _Erythronium_.\r\n\r\n  By carefully picking to pieces the young ovaries, ovules in all\r\n  stages of development may be found, and on account of their small\r\n  size and transparency, show beautifully their structure. Being\r\n  perfectly transparent, it is only necessary to mount them in water\r\n  and cover.\r\n\r\n  The young ovule (_I_, _J_) consists of a central, elongated body\r\n  (nucellus), having a single layer of cells enclosing a large central\r\n  cell (the macrospore or embryo sac) (_sp._). The base of the\r\n  nucellus is surrounded by two circular ridges (i, ii) of which the\r\n  inner is at first higher than the outer one, but later (_K_, _L_),\r\n  the latter grows up above it and completely conceals it as well as\r\n  the nucellus. One side of the ovule grows much faster than the\r\n  other, so that it is completely bent upon itself, and the opening\r\n  between the integuments is brought close to the base of the ovule\r\n  (Fig. 95, _L_). This opening is called the \"micropyle,\" and allows\r\n  the pollen tube to enter.\r\n\r\n  The full-grown embryo sac shows the same structure as that already\r\n  described in _Monotropa_ (page 276), but as the walls of the\r\n  full-grown ovule are thicker here, its structure is rather difficult\r\n  to make out. The ripe stigma is covered with little papillæ\r\n  (Fig. 95, _F_) that hold the pollen spores which may be found here\r\n  sending out the pollen tube. By carefully opening the ovary and\r\n  slightly crushing it in a drop of water, the pollen tube may\r\n  sometimes be seen growing along the stalk of the ovule until it\r\n  reaches and enters the micropyle.\r\n\r\n  To study the embryo a series of young fruits should be selected, and\r\n  the ovules carefully dissected out and mounted in water, to which a\r\n  little caustic potash has been added. The ovule will be thus\r\n  rendered transparent, and by pressing gently on the cover glass with\r\n  a needle so as to flatten the ovule slightly, there is usually no\r\n  trouble in seeing the embryo lying in the upper part of the embryo\r\n  sac, and by pressing more firmly it can often be forced out upon the\r\n  slide. The potash should now be removed as completely as possible\r\n  with blotting paper, and pure water run under the cover glass.\r\n\r\n  The fertilized egg cell first secretes a membrane, and then divides\r\n  into a row of cells (_N_) of which the one nearest the micropyle is\r\n  often much enlarged. The cell at the other end next enlarges and\r\n  becomes divided by walls at right angles to each other into eight\r\n  cells. This globular mass of cells, together with the cell next to\r\n  it, is the embryo plant, the row of cells to which it is attached\r\n  taking no further part in the process, and being known as the\r\n  \"suspensor.\" Later the embryo becomes indented above and forms two\r\n  lobes (_Q_), which are the beginnings of the cotyledons. The first\r\n  root and the stem arise from the cells next the suspensor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF DICOTYLEDONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION I.--_Choripetalæ_.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the dicotyledons may be placed in one of two great\r\ndivisions distinguished by the character of the petals. In the first\r\ngroup, called _Choripetalæ_, the petals are separate, or in some\r\ndegenerate forms entirely absent. As familiar examples of this group,\r\nwe may select the buttercup, rose, pink, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe second group (_Sympetalæ_ or _Gamopetalæ_) comprises those\r\ndicotyledons whose flowers have the petals more or less completely\r\nunited into a tube. The honeysuckles, mints, huckleberry, lilac, etc.,\r\nare familiar representatives of the _Sympetalæ_, which includes the\r\nhighest of all plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Iulifloræ. _A_, male; _B_, female\r\ninflorescence of a willow, _Salix_ (_Amentaceæ_), × ½. _C_, a single\r\nmale flower, × 2. _D_, a female flower, × 2. _E_, cross-section of the\r\novary, × 8. _F_, an opening fruit. _G_, single seed with its hairy\r\nappendage, × 2.]\r\n\r\nThe _Choripetalæ_ may be divided into six groups, including twenty-two\r\norders. The first group is called _Iulifloræ_, and contains numerous,\r\nfamiliar plants, mostly trees. In these plants, the flowers are small\r\nand inconspicuous, and usually crowded into dense catkins, as in\r\nwillows (Fig. 96) and poplars, or in spikes or heads, as in the\r\nlizard-tail (Fig. 97, _G_), or hop (Fig. 97, _I_). The individual\r\nflowers are very small and simple in structure, being often reduced to\r\nthe gynœcium or andræcium, carpels and stamens being almost always in\r\nseparate flowers. The outer leaves of the flower (sepals and petals)\r\nare either entirely wanting or much reduced, and never differentiated\r\ninto calyx and corolla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Types of _Iulifloræ_. _A_, branch of hazel,\r\n_Corylus_ (_Cupuliferæ_), × 1. ♂, male; ♀, female inflorescence. _B_,\r\na single male flower, × 3. _C_, section of the ovary of a female\r\nflower, × 25. _D_, acorn of red oak, _Quercus_ (_Cupuliferæ_), × ½.\r\n_E_, seed of white birch, _Betula_ (_Betulaceæ_), × 3. _F_, fruit of\r\nhorn-bean, _Carpinus_ (_Cupuliferæ_), × 1. G, lizard-tail, _Saururus_\r\n(_Saurureæ_), × ¼. _H_, a single flower, × 2. _I_, female\r\ninflorescence of the hop, _Humulus_ (_Cannabineæ_), × 1. _J_, a single\r\nscale with two flowers, × 1. _K_, a male flower of a nettle, _Urtica_\r\n(_Urticaceæ_), × 5.]\r\n\r\nIn the willows (Fig. 96) the stamens are bright-colored, so that the\r\nflowers are quite showy, and attract numerous insects which visit them\r\nfor pollen and nectar, and serve to carry the pollen to the pistillate\r\nflowers, thus insuring their fertilization. In the majority of the\r\ngroup, however, the flowers are wind-fertilized. An excellent example\r\nof this is seen in the common hazel (Fig. 97, _A_). The male flowers\r\nare produced in great numbers in drooping catkins at the ends of the\r\nbranches, shedding the pollen in early spring before the leaves\r\nunfold. The female flowers are produced on the same branches, but\r\nlower down, and in much smaller numbers. The stigmas are long, and\r\ncovered with minute hairs that catch the pollen which is shaken out\r\nin clouds every time the plant is shaken by the wind, and falls in a\r\nshower over the stigmas. A similar arrangement is seen in the oaks,\r\nhickories, and walnuts.\r\n\r\nThere are three orders of the _Iulifloræ_: _Amentaceæ_, _Piperineæ_,\r\nand _Urticinæ_. The first contains the birches (_Betulaceæ_); oaks,\r\nbeeches, hazels, etc. (_Cupuliferæ_); walnuts and hickories\r\n(_Juglandeæ_); willows and poplars (_Salicaceæ_). They are all trees\r\nor shrubs; the fruit is often a nut, and the embryo is very large,\r\ncompletely filling it.\r\n\r\nThe _Piperineæ_ are mostly tropical plants, and include the pepper\r\nplant (_Piper_), as well as other plants with similar properties. Of\r\nour native forms, the only common one is the lizard-tail (_Saururus_),\r\nnot uncommon in swampy ground. In these plants, the calyx and corolla\r\nare entirely absent, but the flowers have both carpels and stamens\r\n(Fig. 97, _H_).\r\n\r\nThe _Urticinæ_ include, among our common plants, the nettle family\r\n(_Urticaceæ_); plane family (_Plataneæ_), represented by the sycamore\r\nor buttonwood (_Platanus_); the hemp family (_Cannabineæ_); and the\r\nelm family (_Ulmaceæ_). The flowers usually have a calyx, and may\r\nhave only stamens or carpels, or both. Sometimes the part of the stem\r\nbearing the flowers may become enlarged and juicy, forming a\r\nfruit-like structure. Well-known examples of this are the fig and\r\nmulberry.\r\n\r\nThe second group of the _Choripetalæ_ is called _Centrospermæ_, and\r\nincludes but a single order comprising seven families, all of which,\r\nexcept one (_Nyctagineæ_), are represented by numerous native species.\r\nThe latter comprises mostly tropical plants, and is represented in our\r\ngardens by the showy \"four-o'clock\" (_Mirabilis_). In this plant, as\r\nin most of the order, the corolla is absent, but here the calyx is\r\nlarge and brightly colored, resembling closely the corolla of a\r\nmorning-glory or petunia. The stamens are usually more numerous than\r\nthe sepals, and the pistil, though composed of several carpels, has,\r\nas a rule, but a single cavity with the ovules arising from the base,\r\nthough sometimes the ovary is several celled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--Types of _Centrospermæ_. _A_, plant of\r\nspring-beauty, _Claytonia_ (_Portulacaceæ_), × ½. _B_, a single\r\nflower, × 1. _C_, fruit, with the sepals removed, × 2. _D_, section of\r\nthe seed, showing the curved embryo (_em._), × 5. _E_, single flower\r\nof smart-weed, _Polygonum_ (_Polygonaceæ_), × 2. _F_, the pistil, × 2.\r\n_G_, section of the ovary, showing the single ovule, × 4. _H_, section\r\nof the seed, × 2. _I_, base of the leaf, showing the sheath, × 1. _J_,\r\nflower of pig-weed, _Chenopodium_ (_Chenopodiaceæ_), × 3: i, from\r\nwithout; ii, in section. _K_, flower of the poke-weed, _Phytolacca_\r\n(_Phytolaccaceæ_), × 2. _L_, fire-pink, _Silene_ (_Caryophyllaceæ_),\r\n× ½. _M_, a flower with half of the calyx and corolla removed, × 1.\r\n_N_, ripe fruit of mouse-ear chick-weed, _Cerastium_ (_Caryophyllaceæ_),\r\nopening by ten teeth at the summit, × 2. _O_, diagram of the flower\r\nof _Silene_.]\r\n\r\nThe first family (_Polygoneæ_) is represented by the various species\r\nof _Polygonum_ (knotgrass, smart-weed, etc.), and among cultivated\r\nplants by the buckwheat (_Fagopyrum_). The goose-foot or pig-weed\r\n(_Chenopodium_) among native plants, and the beet and spinach of the\r\ngardens are examples of the family _Chenopodiaceæ_. Nearly resembling\r\nthe last is the amaranth family (_Amarantaceæ_), of which the showy\r\namaranths and coxcombs of the gardens, and the coarse, green amaranth\r\nor pig-weed are representatives.\r\n\r\nThe poke-weed (_Phytolacca_) (Fig. 98, _K_), so conspicuous in autumn\r\non account of its dark-purple clusters of berries and crimson stalks,\r\nis our only representative of the family _Phytolaccaceæ_. The two\r\nhighest families are the purslane family (_Portulacaceæ_) and pink\r\nfamily (_Caryophylleæ_). These are mostly plants with showy flowers in\r\nwhich the petals are large and conspicuous, though some of the pink\r\nfamily, _e.g._ some chick-weeds, have no petals. Of the purslane\r\nfamily the portulacas of the gardens, and the common purslane or\r\n\"pusley,\" and the spring-beauty (_Claytonia_) (Fig. 98, _A_) are the\r\ncommonest examples. The pink family is represented by many common and\r\noften showy plants. The carnation, Japanese pinks, and sweet-william,\r\nall belonging to the genus _Dianthus_, of which there are also two or\r\nthree native species, are among the showiest of the family. The genera\r\n_Lychnis_ and _Silene_ (Fig. 98, _L_) also contain very showy species.\r\nOf the less conspicuous genera, the chick-weeds (_Cerastium_ and\r\n_Stellaria_) are the most familiar.\r\n\r\nThe third group of the _Choripetalæ_ (the _Aphanocyclæ_) is a very\r\nlarge one and includes many common plants distributed among five\r\norders. The lower ones have all the parts of the flower entirely\r\nseparate, and often indefinite in number; the higher have the gynœcium\r\ncomposed of two or more carpels united to form a compound pistil.\r\n\r\nThe first order (_Polycarpæ_) includes ten families, of which the\r\nbuttercup family (_Ranunculaceæ_) is the most familiar. The plants of\r\nthis family show much variation in the details of the flowers, which\r\nare usually showy, but the general plan is much the same. In some of\r\nthem, like the anemones (Fig. 99, _A_), clematis, and others, the\r\ncorolla is absent, but the sepals are large and brightly colored so as\r\nto appear like petals. In the columbine (_Aquilegia_) (Fig. 99, _F_)\r\nthe petals are tubular, forming nectaries, and in the larkspur\r\n(Fig. 99, _T_) one of the sepals is similarly changed.\r\n\r\nRepresenting the custard-apple family (_Anonaceæ_) is the curious\r\npapaw (_Asimina_), common in many parts of the United States\r\n(Fig. 100, _A_). The family is mainly a tropical one, but this species\r\nextends as far north as southern Michigan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Types of _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Polycarpæ_), family\r\n_Ranunculaceæ_. _A_, Rue anemone (_Anemonilla_), × ½. _B_, a fruit,\r\n× 2. _C_, section of the same. _D_, section of a buttercup flower\r\n(_Ranunculus_), × 1½. _E_, diagram of buttercup flower. _F_, wild\r\ncolumbine (_Aquilegia_), × ½. _G_, one of the spur-shaped petals, × 1.\r\n_H_, the five pistils, × 1. _I_, longitudinal section of the fruit,\r\n× 1. _J_, flower of larkspur (_Delphinium_), × 1. _K_, the four petals\r\nand stamens, after the removal of the five colored and petal-like\r\nsepals, × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe magnolia family (_Magnoliaceæ_) has several common members, the\r\nmost widely distributed being, perhaps, the tulip-tree (_Liriodendron_)\r\n(Fig. 100, _C_), much valued for its timber. Besides this there are\r\nseveral species of magnolia, the most northerly species being the\r\nsweet-bay (_Magnolia glauca_) of the Atlantic States, and the\r\ncucumber-tree (_M. acuminata_); the great magnolia (_M. grandiflora_)\r\nis not hardy in the northern states.\r\n\r\nThe sweet-scented shrub (_Calycanthus_) (Fig. 100, _G_) is the only\r\nmember of the family _Calycanthaceæ_ found within our limits. It grows\r\nwild in the southern states, and is cultivated for its sweet-scented,\r\ndull, reddish flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Types of _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Polycarpæ_). _A_,\r\nbranch of papaw, _Asimina_ (_Anonaceæ_), × ½. _B_, section of the\r\nflower, × 1. _C_, flower and leaf of tulip-tree, _Liriodendron_\r\n(_Magnoliaceæ_), × ⅓. _D_, section of a flower, × ½. _E_, a ripe\r\nfruit, × 1. _F_, diagram of the flower. _G_, flower of the\r\nsweet-scented shrub, _Calycanthus_ (_Calycanthaceæ_), × ½]\r\n\r\nThe barberry (_Berberis_) (Fig. 101, _A_) is the type of the family\r\n_Berberideæ_, which also includes the curious mandrake or may-apple\r\n(_Podophyllum_) (Fig. 101, _D_), and the twin-leaf or rheumatism-root\r\n(_Jeffersonia_), whose curious seed vessel is shown in Figure 101,\r\n_G_. The fruit of the barberry and may-apple are edible, but the root\r\nof the latter is poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe curious woody twiner, moon-seed (_Menispermum_) (Fig. 101, _I_),\r\nis the sole example in the northern states of the family _Menispermeæ_\r\nto which it belongs. The flowers are diœcious, and the pistillate\r\nflowers are succeeded by black fruits looking like grapes. The\r\nflattened, bony seed is curiously sculptured, and has the embryo\r\ncurled up within it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Types of _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Polycarpæ_). _A-H_,\r\n_Berberidaceæ_. _A_, flower of barberry (_Berberis_), × 2. _B_, the\r\nsame in section. _C_, a stamen, showing the method of opening, × 3.\r\n_D_, flower of may-apple (_Podophyllum_), × ½. _E_, section of the\r\novary of _D_, × 1. _F_, diagram of the flower. _G_, ripe fruit of\r\ntwin-leaf (_Jeffersonia_), opening by a lid, × ½. _H_, section of\r\nseed, showing the embryo (_em._), × 2. _I_, young leaf and cluster of\r\nmale flowers of moon-seed, _Menispermum_ (_Menispermeæ_), × 1. _J_, a\r\nsingle male flower, × 2. _K_, section of a female flower, × 2. _L_,\r\nripe seed, × 1. _M_, section of _L_, showing the curved embryo.]\r\n\r\nThe last two families of the order, the laurel family (_Laurineæ_) and\r\nthe nutmeg family (_Myristicineæ_) are mostly tropical plants,\r\ncharacterized by the fragrance of the bark, leaves, and fruit. The\r\nformer is represented by the sassafras and spice-bush, common\r\nthroughout the eastern United States. The latter has no members within\r\nour borders, but is familiar to all through the common nutmeg, which\r\nis the seed of _Myristica fragrans_ of the East Indies. \"Mace\" is the\r\n\"aril\" or covering of the seed of the same plant.\r\n\r\nThe second order of the _Aphanocyclæ_ comprises a number of aquatic\r\nplants, mostly of large size, and is known as the _Hydropeltidinæ_.\r\nThe flowers and leaves are usually very large, the latter usually\r\nnearly round in outline, and frequently with the stalk inserted near\r\nthe middle. The leaves of the perigone are numerous, and sometimes\r\nmerge gradually into the stamens, as we find in the common white\r\nwater-lily (_Castalia_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Types of _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Hydropeltidinæ_).\r\n_A_, yellow water-lily, _Nymphæa_ (_Nymphæaceæ_), × ½. _B_, a leaf of\r\nthe same, × ⅙. _C_, freshly opened flower, with the large petal-like\r\nsepals removed, × ½. _p_, petals. _an._ stamens. _st._ stigma. _D_,\r\nsection of the ovary, × 2. _E_, young fruit, × ½. _F_, lotus,\r\n_Nelumbo_ (_Nelumbieæ_). × ⅙. _G_, a stamen, × 1. _H_, the large\r\nreceptacle, with the separate pistils sunk in its surface, × ½. _I_,\r\nsection of a single pistil, × 2. _ov._ the ovule. _J_, upper part of a\r\nsection through the stigma and ovule (_ov._), × 4.]\r\n\r\nThere are three families, all represented within the United States.\r\nThe first (_Nelumbieæ_) has but a single species, the yellow lotus or\r\nnelumbo (_Nelumbo lutea_), common in the waters of the west and\r\nsouthwest, but rare eastward (Fig. 101, _F_). In this flower, the end\r\nof the flower axis is much enlarged, looking like the rose of a\r\nwatering-pot, and has the large, separate carpels embedded in its\r\nupper surface. When ripe, each forms a nut-like fruit which is edible.\r\nThere are but two species of _Nelumbo_ known, the second one\r\n(_N. speciosa_) being a native of southeastern Asia, and probably\r\nfound in ancient times in Egypt, as it is represented frequently in\r\nthe pictures and carvings of the ancient Egyptians. It differs mainly\r\nfrom our species in the color of its flowers which are red instead of\r\nyellow. It has recently been introduced into New Jersey where it has\r\nbecome well established in several localities.\r\n\r\nThe second family (_Cabombeæ_) is also represented at the north by but\r\none species, the water shield (_Brasenia_), not uncommon in marshes.\r\nIts flowers are quite small, of a dull-purple color, and the leaves\r\noval in outline and centrally peltate, _i.e._ the leaf stalk inserted\r\nin the centre. The whole plant is covered with a transparent\r\ngelatinous coat.\r\n\r\nThe third family (_Nymphæaceæ_) includes the common white water-lilies\r\n(_Castalia_) and the yellow water-lilies (_Nymphæa_) (Fig. 102, _A_).\r\nIn the latter the petals are small and inconspicuous (Fig. 102, _C_,\r\n_p_), but the sepals are large and showy. In this family the carpels,\r\ninstead of being separate, are united into a large compound pistil.\r\nThe water-lilies reach their greatest perfection in the tropics, where\r\nthey attain an enormous size, the white, blue, or red flowers of some\r\nspecies being thirty centimetres or more in diameter, and the leaves\r\nof the great _Victoria regia_ of the Amazon reaching two metres or\r\nmore in width.\r\n\r\nThe third order of the _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Rhœadinæ_ or _Crucifloræ_)\r\ncomprises a number of common plants, principally characterized by\r\nhaving the parts of the flowers in twos or fours, so that they are\r\nmore or less distinctly cross-shaped, whence the name _Crucifloræ_.\r\n\r\nThere are four families, of which the first is the poppy family\r\n(_Papaveraceæ_), including the poppies, eschscholtzias, Mexican or\r\nprickly poppy (_Argemone_), etc., of the gardens, and the blood-root\r\n(_Sanguinaria_), celandine poppy (_Stylophorum_), and a few other wild\r\nplants (see Fig. 103, _A-I_). Most of the family have a colored juice\r\n(latex), which is white in the poppy, yellow in celandine and\r\n_Argemone_, and orange-red in the blood-root. From the latex of the\r\nopium poppy the opium of commerce is extracted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Types of _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Rhœdinæ_). _A_,\r\nplant of blood-root, _Sanguinaria_ (_Papaveraceæ_), × ⅓. _B_, a single\r\nflower, × 1. _C_, fruit, × ½. _D_, section of the seed. _em._ embryo,\r\n× 2. _E_, diagram of the flower. _F_, flower of Dutchman's breeches,\r\n_Dicentra_ (_Fumariaceæ_), × 1. _G_, group of three stamens of the\r\nsame, × 2. _H_, one of the inner petals, × 2. _I_, fruit of celandine\r\npoppy, _Stylophorum_ (_Papaveraceæ_), × ½. _J_, flower of mustard,\r\n_Brassica_ (_Cruciferæ_), × 1. _K_, the same, with the petals removed,\r\n× 2. _L_, fruit of the same, × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe second family, the fumitories (_Fumariaceæ_) are delicate, smooth\r\nplants, with curious flowers and compound leaves. The garden\r\nbleeding-heart (_Dicentra spectabilis_) and the pretty, wild\r\n_Dicentras_ (Fig. 103, _F_) are familiar to nearly every one.\r\n\r\nOther examples are the mountain fringe (_Adlumia_), a climbing\r\nspecies, and several species of _Corydalis_, differing mainly from\r\n_Dicentra_ in having the corolla one-sided.\r\n\r\nThe mustard family (_Cruciferæ_) comprises by far the greater part of\r\nthe order. The shepherd's-purse, already studied, belongs here, and\r\nmay be taken as a type of the family. There is great uniformity in all\r\nas regards the flowers, so that the classification is based mainly on\r\ndifferences in the fruit and seeds. Many of the most valuable garden\r\nvegetables, as well as a few more or less valuable wild plants, are\r\nmembers of the family, which, however, includes some troublesome\r\nweeds. Cabbages, turnips, radishes, with all their varieties, belong\r\nhere, as well as numerous species of wild cresses. A few like the\r\nwall-flower (_Cheiranthus_) and stock (_Matthiola_) are cultivated for\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nThe last family is the caper family (_Capparideæ_), represented by\r\nonly a few not common plants. The type of the order is _Capparis_,\r\nwhose pickled flower-buds constitute capers.\r\n\r\nThe fourth order (_Cistifloræ_) of the _Aphanocyclæ_ is a very large\r\none, but the majority of the sixteen families included in it are not\r\nrepresented within our limits. The flowers have the sepals and petals\r\nin fives, the stamens either the same or more numerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Types of _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Cistifloræ_). _A_,\r\nflower of wild blue violet, _Viola_ (_Violaceæ_), × 1. _B_, the lower\r\npetal prolonged behind into a sac or spur, × 1. _C_, the stamens, × 2.\r\n_D_, pistil, × 2. _E_, a leaf, × ½. _F_, section of the ovary, × 2.\r\n_G_, the fruit, × 1. _H_, the same after it has opened, × 1. _I_,\r\ndiagram of the flower. _J_, flower of mignonette, _Reseda_\r\n(_Resedaceæ_), × 2. _K_, a petal, × 3. _L_, cross-section of the\r\novary, × 3. _M_, fruit, × 1. _N_, plant of sundew, _Drosera_\r\n(_Droseraceæ_), × ½. _O_, a leaf that has captured a mosquito, × 2.\r\n_P_, flower of another species (_D. filiformis_), × 2. _Q_,\r\ncross-section of the ovary, × 4.]\r\n\r\nAmong the commoner members of the order are the mignonettes\r\n(_Resedaceæ_) and the violets (_Violaceæ_), of which the various wild\r\nand cultivated species are familiar plants (Fig. 104, _A_, _M_). The\r\nsundews (_Droseraceæ_) are most extraordinary plants, growing in boggy\r\nland over pretty much the whole world. They are represented in\r\nthe United States by several species of sundew (_Drosera_), and the\r\nstill more curious Venus's-flytrap (_Dionæa_) of North Carolina. The\r\nleaves of the latter are sensitive, and composed of two parts which\r\nsnap together like a steel trap. If an insect lights upon the leaf,\r\nand touches certain hairs upon its upper surface, the two parts snap\r\ntogether, holding the insect tightly. A digestive fluid is secreted by\r\nglands upon the inner surface of the leaf, and in a short time the\r\ncaptured insect is actually digested and absorbed by the leaves. The\r\nsame process takes place in the sundew (Fig. 104, _N_) where, however,\r\nthe mechanism is somewhat different. Here the tentacles, with which\r\nthe leaf is studded, secrete a sticky fluid which holds any small\r\ninsect that may light upon it. The tentacles now slowly bend inward\r\nand finally the edges of the leaf as well, until the captured insect\r\nis firmly held, when a digestive process, similar to that in _Dionœa_,\r\ntakes place. This curious habit is probably to be explained from the\r\nposition where the plant grows, the roots being in water where there\r\ndoes not seem to be a sufficient supply of nitrogenous matter for the\r\nwants of the plant, which supplements the supply from the bodies of\r\nthe captured insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Types of _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Cistifloræ_). _A_,\r\n_B_, leaves of the pitcher-plant, _Sarracenia_ (_Sarraceniaceæ_). _A_,\r\nfrom the side; _B_, from in front, × ½. _C_, St. John's-wort\r\n(_Hypericum_), × ½. _D_, a flower, × 1. _E_, the pistil, × 2. _G_,\r\ncross-section of the ovary, × 4. _H_, diagram of the flower.]\r\n\r\nSimilar in their habits, but differing much in appearance from the\r\nsundews, are the pitcher-plants (_Sarraceniaceæ_), of which one\r\nspecies (_Sarracenia purpurea_) is very common in peat bogs throughout\r\nthe northern United States. In this species (Fig. 105, _A_, _B_), the\r\nleaves form a rosette, from the centre of which arises in early summer\r\na tall stalk bearing a single, large, nodding, dark-reddish flower\r\nwith a curious umbrella-shaped pistil. The leaf stalk is hollow and\r\nswollen, with a broad wing on one side, and the blade of the leaf\r\nforms a sort of hood at the top. The interior of the pitcher is\r\ncovered above with stiff, downward-pointing hairs, while below it is\r\nvery smooth. Insects readily enter the pitcher, but on attempting to\r\nget out, the smooth, slippery wall at the bottom, and the stiff,\r\ndownward-directed hairs above, prevent their escape, and they fall\r\ninto the fluid which fills the bottom of the cup and are drowned, the\r\nleaf absorbing the nitrogenous compounds given off during the process\r\nof decomposition. There are other species common in the southern\r\nstates, and a California pitcher-plant (_Darlingtonia_) has a colored\r\nappendage at the mouth of the pitcher which serves to lure insects\r\ninto the trap.\r\n\r\nAnother family of pitcher-plants (_Nepentheæ_) is found in the warmer\r\nparts of the old world, and some of them are occasionally cultivated\r\nin greenhouses. In these the pitchers are borne at the tips of the\r\nleaves attached to a long tendril.\r\n\r\nTwo other families of the order contain familiar native plants, the\r\nrock-rose family (_Cistaceæ_), and the St. John's-worts\r\n(_Hypericaceæ_). The latter particularly are common plants, with\r\nnumerous showy yellow flowers, the petals usually marked with black\r\nspecks, and the leaves having clear dots scattered through them. The\r\nstamens are numerous, and often in several distinct groups (Fig. 105,\r\n_C_, _D_).\r\n\r\nThe last order of the _Aphanocyclæ_ (the _Columniferæ_) has three\r\nfamilies, of which two, the mallows (_Malvaceæ_), and the lindens\r\n(_Tiliaceæ_), include well-known species. Of the former, the various\r\nspecies of mallows (Fig. 106, _A_) belonging to the genus _Malva_ are\r\ncommon, as well as some species of _Hibiscus_, including the showy\r\nswamp _Hibiscus_ or rose-mallow (_H. moscheutos_), common in salt\r\nmarshes and in the fresh-water marshes of the great lake region. The\r\nhollyhock and shrubby _Althæa_ are familiar cultivated plants of this\r\norder, and the cotton-plant (_Gossypium_) also belongs here. In all of\r\nthese the stamens are much branched, and united into a tube enclosing\r\nthe style. Most of them are characterized also by the development of\r\ngreat quantities of a mucilaginous matter within their tissues.\r\n\r\nThe common basswood (_Tilia_) is the commonest representative of the\r\nfamily _Tiliaceæ_ (Fig. 106, _G_). The nearly related European linden,\r\nor lime-tree, is sometimes planted. Its leaves are ordinarily somewhat\r\nsmaller than our native species, which it, however, closely resembles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Types of _Aphanocyclæ_ (_Columniferæ_). _A_,\r\nflower and leaf of the common mallow, _Malva_ (_Malvaceæ_), × ½. _B_,\r\na flower bud, × 1. _C_, section of a flower, × 2. _D_, the fruit, × 2.\r\n_E_, section of one division of the fruit, with the enclosed seed,\r\n× 3. _em._ the embryo. _F_, diagram of the flower. _G_, leaf and\r\ninflorescence of the basswood, _Tilia_ (_Tiliaceæ_), × ⅓. _br._ a\r\nbract. _H_, a single flower, × 1. _I_, group of stamens, with\r\npetal-like appendage (_x_), × 2. _J_, diagram of the flower.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth group of the _Choripetalæ_ is the _Eucyclæ_. The flowers\r\nmost commonly have the parts in fives, and the stamens are never more\r\nthan twice as many as the sepals. The carpels are usually more or less\r\ncompletely united into a compound pistil. There are four orders,\r\ncomprising twenty-five families.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Types of _Eucyclæ_ (_Gruinales_). _A_, wild\r\ncrane's-bill _Geranium_ (_Geraniaceæ_), × ½. _B_, a petal, × 1. _C_,\r\nthe young fruit, the styles united in a column, × ½. _D_, the ripe\r\nfruit, the styles separating to discharge the seeds, × ½. _E_, section\r\nof a seed, × 2. _F_, wild flax. _Linum_ (_Linaceæ_), × ½. _G_, a\r\nsingle flower, × 2. _H_, cross-section of the young fruit, × 3. _I_,\r\nflower. _J_, leaf of wood-sorrel, _Oxalis_ (_Oxalideæ_), × 1. _K_, the\r\nstamens and pistil, × 2. _L_, flower of jewel-weed, _Impatiens_\r\n(_Balsamineæ_), × 1. _M_, the same, with the parts separated. _p_,\r\npetals. _s_, sepals. _an._ stamens. _gy._ pistil. _N_, fruit, × 1.\r\n_O_, the same, opening. _P_, a seed, × 2.]\r\n\r\nThe first order (_Gruinales_) includes six families, consisting for\r\nthe most part of plants with conspicuous flowers. Here belong the\r\ngeraniums (Fig. 107, _A_), represented by the wild geraniums and\r\ncrane's-bill, and the very showy geraniums (_Pelargonium_) of the\r\ngardens. The nasturtiums (_Tropæolum_) represent another family,\r\nmostly tropical, and the wood-sorrels (_Oxalis_) (Fig. 107, _I_) are\r\ncommon, both wild and cultivated. The most useful member of the order\r\nis unquestionably the common flax (_Linum_), of which there are also\r\nseveral native species (Fig. 107, _F_). These are types of the flax\r\nfamily (_Linaceæ_). Linen is the product of the tough, fibrous inner\r\nbark of _L. usitatissimum_, which has been cultivated for its fibre\r\nfrom time immemorial. The last family is the balsam family\r\n(_Balsamineæ_). The jewel-weed or touch-me-not (_Impatiens_), so\r\ncalled from the sensitive pods which spring open on being touched, is\r\nvery common in moist ground everywhere (Fig. 107, _L-P_). The garden\r\nbalsam, or lady's slipper, is a related species (_I. balsamina_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--_Eucyclæ_ (_Terebinthinæ_, _Æsculinæ_). _A_,\r\nleaves and flowers of sugar-maple, _Acer_ (_Aceraceæ_), × ½. _B_, a\r\nmale flower, × 2. _C_, diagram of a perfect flower. _D_, fruit of the\r\nsilver-maple, × ½. _E_, section across the seed, × 2. _F_, embryo\r\nremoved from the seed, × 1. _G_, leaves and flowers of bladder-nut,\r\n_Staphylea_, (_Sapindaceæ_), × ½. _H_, section of a flower, × 2. _I_,\r\ndiagram of the flower. _J_, flower of buckeye (_Æsculus_), × 1½. _K_,\r\nflower of smoke-tree, _Rhus_ (_Anacardiaceæ_), × 3. _L_, the same, in\r\nsection.]\r\n\r\nThe second order (_Terebinthinæ_) contains but few common plants.\r\nThere are six families, mostly inhabitants of the warmer parts of\r\nthe world. The best-known members of the order are the orange, lemon,\r\ncitron, and their allies. Of our native plants the prickly ash\r\n(_Zanthoxylum_), and the various species of sumach (_Rhus_), are\r\nthe best known. In the latter genus belong the poison ivy\r\n(_R. toxicodendron_) and the poison dogwood (_R. venenata_). The\r\nVenetian sumach or smoke-tree (_R. Cotinus_) is commonly planted for\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nThe third order of the _Eucyclæ_, the _Æsculinæ_, embraces six\r\nfamilies, of which three, the horsechestnuts, etc. (_Sapindaceæ_), the\r\nmaples (_Aceraceæ_), and the milkworts (_Polygalaceæ_), have several\r\nrepresentatives in the northern United States. Of the first the\r\nbuckeye (_Æsculus_) (Fig. 108, _J_) and the bladder-nut (_Staphylea_)\r\n(Fig. 108, _G_) are the commonest native genera, while the\r\nhorsechestnut (_Æsculus hippocastanum_) is everywhere planted.\r\n\r\nThe various species of maple (_Acer_) are familiar examples of the\r\n_Aceraceæ_ (see Fig. 106, _A_, _F_).\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last order of the _Eucyclæ_, the _Frangulinæ_, is\r\ncomposed mainly of plants with inconspicuous flowers, the stamens as\r\nmany as the petals. Not infrequently they are diœcious, or in some,\r\nlike the grape, some of the flowers may be unisexual while others are\r\nhermaphrodite (_i.e._ have both stamens and pistil). Among the\r\ncommoner plants of the order may be mentioned the spindle-tree, or\r\nburning-bush, as it is sometimes called (_Euonymus_) (Fig. 109, _A_),\r\nand the climbing bitter-sweet (_Celastrus_) (Fig. 109, _D_), belonging\r\nto the family _Celastraceæ_; the holly and black alder, species of\r\n_Ilex_, are examples of the family _Aquifoliaceæ_; the various species\r\nof grape (_Vitis_), the Virginia creeper (_Ampelopsis quinquefolia_),\r\nand one or two other cultivated species of the latter, represent the\r\nvine family (_Vitaceæ_ or _Ampelidæ_), and the buckthorn (_Rhamnus_)\r\nis the type of the _Rhamnaceæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--_Eucylæ_ (_Frangulinæ_), _Tricoccæ_. _A_,\r\nflowers of spindle-tree, _Euonymus_, (_Celastraceæ_), × 1. _B_,\r\ncross-section of the ovary, × 2. _C_, diagram of the flower. _D_, leaf\r\nand fruit of bitter-sweet (_Celastrus_), × ½. _E_, fruit opening and\r\ndisclosing the seeds. _F_, section of a nearly ripe fruit, showing the\r\nseeds surrounded by the scarlet integument (aril). _em._ the embryo,\r\n× 1. _G_, flower of grape-vine, _Vitis_ (_Vitaceæ_), × 2.

The flowers are small and inconspicuous,\r\nthough sometimes, as in some _Euphorbias_ and the showy _Poinsettia_\r\nof the greenhouses, the leaves or bracts surrounding the inflorescence\r\nare conspicuously colored, giving the whole the appearance of a large,\r\nshowy, single flower. In northern countries the plants are mostly\r\nsmall weeds, of which the various spurges or _Euphorbias_ are the most\r\nfamiliar. These plants (Fig. 109, _K_) have the small flowers\r\nsurrounded by a cup-shaped involucre (_L_, _M_) so that the whole\r\ninflorescence looks like a single flower. In the spurges, as in the\r\nother members of the order, the flowers are very simple, being often\r\nreduced to a single stamen or pistil (Fig. 109, _M_, _N_). The plants\r\ngenerally abound in a milky juice which is often poisonous. This juice\r\nin a number of tropical genera is the source of India-rubber. Some\r\ngenera like the castor-bean (_Ricinus_) and _Croton_ are cultivated\r\nfor their large, showy leaves.\r\n\r\nThe water starworts (_Callitriche_), not uncommon in stagnant water,\r\nrepresent the family _Callitrichaceæ_, and the box (_Buxus_) is the\r\ntype of the _Buxaceæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--Types of _Calycifloræ_ (_Umbellifloræ_).\r\n_A_, inflorescence of wild parsnip, _Pastinaca_ (_Umbelliferæ_), × ½.\r\n_B_, single flower of the same, × 3. _C_, a leaf, showing the\r\nsheathing base, × ¼. _D_, a fruit, × 2. _E_, cross-section of _D_.\r\n_F_, part of the inflorescence of spikenard, _Aralia_ (_Araliaceæ_),\r\n× 1. _G_, a single flower of the same, × 3. _H_, the fruit, × 2. _I_,\r\ncross-section of the _H_. _J_, inflorescence of dogwood, _Cornus_\r\n(_Corneæ_).

With few exceptions, the floral\r\naxis grows up around the ovary, carrying the outer floral leaves above\r\nit, and the ovary appears at the bottom of a cup around whose edge the\r\nother parts of the flower are arranged. Sometimes, as in the fuchsia,\r\nthe ovary is grown to the base of the cup or tube, and thus looks as\r\nif it were outside the flower. Such an ovary is said to be \"inferior\"\r\nin distinction from one that is entirely free from the tube, and thus\r\nis evidently within the flower. The latter is the so-called \"superior\"\r\novary. The carpels are usually united into a compound pistil, but may\r\nbe separate, as in the stonecrop (Fig. 111, _E_), or strawberry\r\n(Fig. 114, _C_).\r\n\r\nThe first order of the _Calycifloræ_ (_Umbellifloræ_) has the flowers\r\nsmall, and usually arranged in umbels, _i.e._ several stalked flowers\r\ngrowing from a common point. The ovary is inferior, and there is a\r\nnectar-secreting disc between the styles and the stamens. Of the three\r\nfamilies, the umbel-worts or _Umbelliferæ_ is the commonest. The\r\nflowers are much alike in all (Fig. 110, _A_, _B_), and nearly all\r\nhave large, compound leaves with broad, sheathing bases. The stems are\r\ngenerally hollow. So great is the uniformity of the flowers and plant,\r\nthat the fruit (Fig. 110, _D_) is generally necessary before the plant\r\ncan be certainly recognized. This is two-seeded in all, but differs\r\nvery much in shape and in the development of oil channels, which\r\nsecrete the peculiar oil that gives the characteristic taste to the\r\nfruits of such forms as caraway, coriander, etc. Some of them, like\r\nthe wild parsnip, poison hemlock, etc., are violent poisons, while\r\nothers like the carrot are perfectly wholesome.\r\n\r\nThe wild spikenard (_Aralia_) (Fig. 110, _F_), ginseng, and the true\r\nivy (_Hedera_) are examples of the _Araliaceæ_, and the various\r\nspecies of dogwood (_Cornus_) (Fig. 110, _J-N_) represent the dogwood\r\nfamily (_Corneæ_).\r\n\r\nThe second order (_Saxifraginæ_) contains eight families, including a\r\nnumber of common wild and cultivated plants. The true saxifrages are\r\nrepresented by several wild and cultivated species of _Saxifraga_, the\r\nlittle bishop's cap or mitre-wort (_Mitella_) (Fig. 111, _D_), and\r\nothers. The wild hydrangea (Fig. 111, _F_) and the showy garden\r\nspecies represent the family _Hydrangeæ_. In these some of the flowers\r\nare large and showy, but with neither stamens nor pistils (neutral),\r\nwhile the small, inconspicuous flowers of the central part of the\r\ninflorescence are perfect. In the garden varieties, all of the flowers\r\nare changed, by selection, into the showy, neutral ones. The syringa\r\nor mock orange (_Philadelphus_) (Fig. 111, _I_), the gooseberry, and\r\ncurrants (_Ribes_) (Fig. 111, _A_), and the stonecrop (_Sedum_)\r\n(Fig. 111, _E_) are types of the families _Philadelpheæ_, _Ribesieæ_,\r\nand _Crassulaceæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--_Calycifloræ_ (_Saxifraginæ_): _A_, flowers\r\nand leaves of wild gooseberry, _Ribes_ (_Ribesieæ_), × 1. _B_,\r\nvertical section of the flower, × 2. _C_, diagram of the flower. _D_,\r\nflower of bishop's-cap, _Mitella_ (_Saxifragaceæ_), × 3. _E_, flower\r\nof stonecrop, _Sedum_ (_Crassulaceæ_), × 2. _F_, flowers and leaves of\r\nhydrangea (_Hydrangeæ_), × ½. _n_, neutral flower. _G_, unopened\r\nflower, × 2. _H_, the same, after the petals have fallen away. _I_,\r\nflower of syringa, _Philadelphus_ (_Philadelpheæ_), × 1. _J_, diagram\r\nof the flower.]\r\n\r\nThe third order (_Opuntieæ_) has but a single family, the cacti\r\n(_Cactaceæ_). These are strictly American in their distribution, and\r\ninhabit especially the dry plains of the southwest, where they reach\r\nan extraordinary development. They are nearly or quite leafless, and\r\nthe fleshy, cylindrical, or flattened stems are usually beset with\r\nstout spines. The flowers (Fig. 112, _A_) are often very showy, so\r\nthat many species are cultivated for ornament and are familiar to\r\nevery one. The beautiful night-blooming cereus, of which there are\r\nseveral species, is one of these. A few species of prickly-pear\r\n(_Opuntia_) occur as far north as New York, but most are confined to\r\nthe hot, dry plains of the south and southwest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--_Calycifloræ_, _Opuntieæ_ (_Passiflorinæ_).\r\n_A_, flower of a cactus, _Mamillaria_ (_Cactaceæ_) (from \"Gray's\r\nStructural Botany\"). _B_, leaf and flower of a passion-flower,\r\n_Passiflora_ (_Passifloraceæ_), × ½. _t_, a tendril. _C_,\r\ncross-section of the ovary, × 2. _D_, diagram of the flower.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order (_Passiflorinæ_) are almost without exception\r\ntropical plants, only a very few extending into the southern United\r\nStates. The type of the order is the passion-flower (_Passiflora_)\r\n(Fig. 112, _B_), whose numerous species are mostly inhabitants of\r\ntropical America, but a few reach into the United States. The only\r\nother members of the order likely to be met with by the student are\r\nthe begonias, of which a great many are commonly cultivated as house\r\nplants on account of their fine foliage and flowers. The leaves are\r\nalways one-sided, and the flowers monœcious.[13] Whether the begonias\r\nproperly belong with the _Passiflorinæ_ has been questioned.\r\n\r\n[13] Monœcious: having stamens and carpels in different flowers, but\r\non the same plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--_Calycifloræ_ (_Myrtifloræ_, _Thymelinæ_).\r\n_A_, flowering branch of moosewood, _Dirca_ (_Thymelæaceæ_), × 1. _B_,\r\na single flower, × 2. _C_, the same, laid open. _D_, a young flower of\r\nwillow herb, _Epilobium_ (_Onagraceæ_), × 1.

The myrtle family, the members of\r\nwhich are all tropical or sub-tropical, gives name to the order. The\r\ntrue myrtle (_Myrtus_) is sometimes cultivated for its pretty glossy\r\ngreen leaves and white flowers, as is also the pomegranate whose\r\nbrilliant, scarlet flowers are extremely ornamental. Cloves are the\r\ndried flower-buds of an East-Indian myrtaceous tree (_Caryophyllus_).\r\nIn Australia the order includes the giant gum-trees (_Eucalyptus_),\r\nthe largest of all known trees, exceeding in size even the giant trees\r\nof California.\r\n\r\nAmong the commoner _Myrtifloræ_, the majority belong to the two\r\nfamilies _Onagraceæ_ and _Lythraceæ_. The former includes the evening\r\nprimroses (_Œnothera_), willow-herb (_Epilobium_) (Fig. 113, _D_),\r\nand fuchsia; the latter, the purple loosestrife (_Lythrum_) and swamp\r\nloosestrife (_Nesæa_). The water-milfoil (_Myriophyllum_) (Fig. 113,\r\n_J_) is an example of the family _Haloragidaceæ_, and the _Rhexias_ of\r\nthe eastern United States represent with us the family _Melastomaceæ_.\r\n\r\nThe sixth order of the _Calycifloræ_ is a small one (_Thymelinæ_),\r\nrepresented in the United States by very few species. The flowers are\r\nfour-parted, the calyx resembling a corolla, which is usually absent.\r\nThe commonest member of the order is the moosewood (_Dirca_)\r\n(Fig. 113, _A_), belonging to the first of the three families\r\n(_Thymelæaceæ_). Of the second family (_Elæagnaceæ_), the commonest\r\nexample is _Shepherdia_, a low shrub having the leaves covered with\r\ncurious, scurfy hairs that give them a silvery appearance. The third\r\nfamily (_Proteaceæ_) has no familiar representatives.\r\n\r\nThe seventh order (_Rosifloræ_) includes many well-known plants, all\r\nof which may be united in one family (_Rosaceæ_), with several\r\nsub-families. The flowers are usually five-parted with from five to\r\nthirty stamens, and usually numerous, distinct carpels. In the apple\r\nand pear (Fig. 114, _I_), however, the carpels are more or less grown\r\ntogether; and in the cherry, peach, etc., there is but a single carpel\r\ngiving rise to a single-seeded stone-fruit (drupe) (Fig. 114, _E_,\r\n_H_). In the strawberry (Fig. 114, _A_), rose (_G_), cinquefoil\r\n(_Potentilla_), etc., there are numerous distinct, one-seeded carpels,\r\nand in _Spiræa_ (Fig. 114, _F_) there are five several-seeded carpels,\r\nforming as many dry pods when ripe. The so-called \"berry\" of the\r\nstrawberry is really the much enlarged flower axis, or \"receptacle,\"\r\nin which the little one-seeded fruits are embedded, the latter being\r\nwhat are ordinarily called the seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--_Calycifloræ_ (_Rosifloræ_). _A_,\r\ninflorescence of strawberry (_Fragaria_), × ½. _B_, a single flower,\r\n× 1. _C_, section of _B_. _D_, floral diagram. _E_, vertical section\r\nof a cherry-flower (_Prunus_), × 1. _F_, vertical section of the\r\nflower of _Spiræa_, × 2. _G_, vertical section of the bud of a wild\r\nrose (_Rosa_), × 1. _H_, vertical section of the young fruit, × 1.\r\n_I_, section of the flower of an apple (_Pyrus_), × 1. _J_, floral\r\ndiagram of apple.]\r\n\r\nFrom the examples given, it will be seen that the order includes not\r\nonly some of the most ornamental, cultivated plants, but the majority\r\nof our best fruits. In addition to those already given, may be\r\nmentioned the raspberry, blackberry, quince, plum, and apricot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--_Calycifloræ_ (_Leguminosæ_). _A_, flowers\r\nand leaf of the common pea, _Pisum_ (_Papilionaceæ_), × ½. _t_,\r\ntendril. _st._ stipules. _B_, the petals, separated and displayed,\r\n× 1. _C_, flower, with the calyx and corolla removed, × 1. _D_, a\r\nfruit divided lengthwise, × ½. _E_, the embryo, with one of the\r\ncotyledons removed, × 2. _F_, diagram of the flower. _G_, flower of\r\nred-bud, _Cercis_ (_Cæsalpinaceæ_), × 2. _H_, the same, with calyx and\r\ncorolla removed. _I_, inflorescence of the sensitive-brier,\r\n_Schrankia_ (_Mimosaceæ_), × 1. _J_, a single flower, × 2.]\r\n\r\nThe last order of the _Calycifloræ_ and the highest of the\r\n_Choripetalæ_ is the order _Leguminosæ_, of which the bean, pea,\r\nclover, and many other common plants are examples. In most of our\r\ncommon forms the flowers are peculiar in shape, one of the petals\r\nbeing larger than the others, and covering them in the bud. This\r\npetal is known as the standard. The two lateral petals are known as\r\nthe wings, and the two lower and inner are generally grown together\r\nforming what is called the \"keel\" (Fig. 115, _A_, _B_). The stamens,\r\nten in number, are sometimes all grown together into a tube, but\r\ngenerally the upper one is free from the others (Fig. 115, _C_). There\r\nis but one carpel which forms a pod with two valves when ripe\r\n(Fig. 115, _D_). The seeds are large, and the embryo fills the seed\r\ncompletely. From the peculiar form of the flower, they are known as\r\n_Papilionaceæ_ (_papilio_, a butterfly). Many of the _Papilionaceæ_\r\nare climbers, either having twining stems, as in the common beans, or\r\nelse with part of the leaf changed into a tendril as in the pea\r\n(Fig. 115, _A_), vetch, etc. The leaves are usually compound.\r\n\r\nOf the second family (_Cæsalpineæ_), mainly tropical, the honey locust\r\n(_Gleditschia_) and red-bud (_Cercis_) (Fig. 115, _G_) are the\r\ncommonest examples. The flowers differ mainly from the _Papilionaceæ_\r\nin being less perfectly papilionaceous, and the stamens are almost\r\nentirely distinct (Fig. 115, _H_). The last family (_Mimosaceæ_) is\r\nalso mainly tropical. The acacias, sensitive-plant (_Mimosa_), and the\r\nsensitive-brier of the southern United States (_Schrankia_) (Fig. 115,\r\n_I_) represent this family. The flowers are quite different from the\r\nothers of the order, being tubular and the petals united, thus\r\nresembling the flowers of the _Sympetalæ_. The leaves of _Mimosa_ and\r\n_Schrankia_ are extraordinarily sensitive, folding up if irritated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF DICOTYLEDONS (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION II.--_Sympetalæ_.\r\n\r\nThe _Sympetalæ_ or _Gamopetalæ_ are at once distinguished from the\r\n_Choripetalæ_ by having the petals more or less united, so that the\r\ncorolla is to some extent tubular. In the last order of the\r\n_Choripetalæ_ we found a few examples (_Mimosaceæ_) where the same\r\nthing is true, and these form a transition from the _Choripetalæ_ to\r\nthe _Sympetalæ_.\r\n\r\nThere are two great divisions, _Isocarpæ_ and _Anisocarpæ_. In the\r\nfirst the carpels are of the same number as the petals and sepals; in\r\nthe second fewer. In both cases the carpels are completely united,\r\nforming a single, compound pistil. In the _Isocarpæ_ there are usually\r\ntwice as many stamens as petals, occasionally the same number.\r\n\r\nThere are three orders of the _Isocarpæ_, viz., _Bicornes_,\r\n_Primulinæ_, and _Diospyrinæ_. The first is a large order with six\r\nfamilies, including many very beautiful plants, and a few of some\r\neconomic value. Of the six families, all but one (_Epacrideæ_) are\r\nrepresented in the United States. Of these the _Pyrolaceæ_ includes\r\nthe pretty little pyrolas and prince's-pine (_Chimaphila_) (Fig. 116,\r\n_J_); the _Monotropeæ_ has as its commonest examples, the curious\r\nIndian-pipe (_Monotropa uniflora_), and pine-sap (_M. hypopitys_)\r\n(Fig. 116, _L_). These grow on decaying vegetable matter, and are\r\nquite devoid of chlorophyll, the former species being pure white\r\nthroughout (hence a popular name, \"ghost flower\"); the latter is\r\nyellowish. The magnificent rhododendrons and azaleas (Fig. 116, _F_),\r\nand the mountain laurel (_Kalmia_) (Fig. 116, _I_), belong to the\r\n_Rhodoraceæ_. The heath family (_Ericaceæ_), besides the true heaths\r\n(_Erica_, _Calluna_), includes the pretty trailing-arbutus or\r\nmay-flower (_Epigæa_), _Andromeda_, _Oxydendrum_ (Fig. 116, _E_),\r\nwintergreen (_Gaultheria_), etc. The last family is represented by the\r\ncranberry (_Vaccinium_) and huckleberry (_Gaylussacia_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Types of _Isocarpous sympetalæ_\r\n(_Bicornes_). _A_, flowers, fruit, and leaves of huckleberry,\r\n_Gaylussacia_ (_Vaccinieæ_), × 1. _B_, vertical section of the flower,\r\n× 3. _C_, a stamen: i, from in front; ii, from the side, × 4. _D_,\r\ncross-section of the young fruit, × 2. _E_, flower of sorrel-tree,\r\n_Oxydendrum_ (_Ericaceæ_), × 2. _F_, flower of azalea (_Rhododendron_),\r\n× ½. _G_, cross-section of the ovary, × 3. _H_, diagram of the flower.\r\n_I_, flower of mountain laurel (_Kalmia_), × 1. _J_, prince's-pine,\r\n_Chimaphila_ (_Pyrolaceæ_), × ½. _K_, a single flower, × 1. _L_, plant\r\nof pine-sap, _Monotropa_, (_Monotropeæ_), × ½. _M_, section of a\r\nflower, × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe second order, the primroses (_Primulinæ_), is principally\r\nrepresented in the cooler parts of the world by the true primrose\r\nfamily (_Primulaceæ_), of which several familiar plants may be\r\nmentioned. The genus _Primula_ includes the European primrose and\r\ncowslip, as well as two or three small American species, and the\r\ncommonly cultivated Chinese primrose. Other genera are _Dodecatheon_,\r\nof which the beautiful shooting-star (_D. Meadia_) (Fig. 117, _A_) is\r\nthe best known. Something like this is _Cyclamen_, sometimes\r\ncultivated as a house plant. The moneywort (_Lysimachia nummularia_)\r\n(Fig. 117, _D_), as well as other species, also belongs here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--_Isocarpous sympetalæ_ (_Primulinæ_,\r\n_Diospyrinæ_). _A_, shooting-star, _Dodecatheon_ (_Primulaceæ_), × ½.\r\n_B_, section of a flower, × 1. _C_, diagram of the flower. _D_,\r\nMoneywort, _Lysimachia_ (_Primulaceæ_), × ½. _E_, a perfect flower of\r\nthe persimmon, _Diospyros_ (_Ebenaceæ_), × 1. _F_, the same, laid open:\r\nsection of the young fruit, × 2. _H_, longitudinal section of a ripe\r\nseed, × 1. _em._ the embryo. _I_, fruit, × ½.]\r\n\r\nThe sea-rosemary (_Statice_) and one or two cultivated species of\r\nplumbago are the only members of the plumbago family (_Plumbagineæ_)\r\nlikely to be met with. The remaining families of the _Primulinæ_ are\r\nnot represented by any common plants.\r\n\r\nThe third and last order of the _Isocarpous sympetalæ_ has but a\r\nsingle common representative in the United States; viz., the persimmon\r\n(_Diospyros_) (Fig. 117, _E_). This belongs to the family _Ebenaceæ_,\r\nto which also belongs the ebony a member of the same genus as the\r\npersimmon, and found in Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe second division of the _Sympetalæ_ (the _Anisocarpæ_) has usually\r\nbut two or three carpels, never as many as the petals. The stamens are\r\nalso never more than five, and very often one or more are abortive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Types of _Anisocarpous sympetalæ_\r\n(_Tubifloræ_). _A_, flower and leaves of wild phlox (_Polemoniaceæ_),\r\n× ½. _B_, section of a flower, × 1. _C_, fruit, × 1. _D_, flower of\r\nblue valerian (_Polemonium_), × 1. _E_, flowers and leaf of\r\nwater-leaf, _Hydrophyllum_ (_Hydrophyllaceæ_), × ½. _F_, section of a\r\nflower, × 1. _G_, flower of wild morning-glory, _Convolvulus_\r\n(_Convolvulaceæ_), × ½.

The first\r\n(_Convolvulaceæ_) has as its type the morning-glory (_Convolvulus_)\r\n(Fig. 118, _G_), and the nearly related _Ipomœas_ of the gardens. The\r\ncurious dodder (_Cuscuta_), whose leafless, yellow stems are sometimes\r\nvery conspicuous, twining over various plants, is a member of this\r\nfamily which has lost its chlorophyll through parasitic habits. The\r\nsweet potato (_Batatas_) is also a member of the morning-glory family.\r\nThe numerous species, wild and cultivated, of phlox (Fig. 118, _A_),\r\nand the blue valerian (_Polemonium_) (Fig. 118, _D_), are examples of\r\nthe family _Polemoniaceæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--_Anisocarpous sympetalæ_ (_Tubifloræ_). _A_,\r\ninflorescence of hound's-tongue, _Cynoglossum_ (_Borragineæ_), × ½.\r\n_B_, section of a flower, × 2. _C_, nearly ripe fruit, × 1. _D_,\r\nflowering branch of nightshade, _Solanum_ (_Solaneæ_), × ½. _E_, a\r\nsingle flower, × 1. _F_, section of the flower, × 2. _G_, young fruit,\r\n× 1. _H_, flower of _Petunia_ (_Solaneæ_), × ½. _I_, diagram of the\r\nflower.]\r\n\r\nThe third family (_Hydrophyllaceæ_) includes several species of\r\nwater-leaf (_Hydrophyllum_) (Fig. 118, _E_) and _Phacelia_, among our\r\nwild flowers, and species of _Nemophila_, _Whitlavia_ and others from\r\nthe western states, but now common in gardens.\r\n\r\nThe Borage family (_Borragineæ_) includes the forget-me-not\r\n(_Myosotis_) and a few pretty wild flowers, _e.g._ the orange-flowered\r\npuccoons (_Lithospermum_); but it also embraces a number of the most\r\ntroublesome weeds, among which are the hound's-tongue (_Cynoglossum_)\r\n(Fig. 119, _A_), and the \"beggar's-ticks\" (_Echinospermum_), whose\r\nprickly fruits (Fig. 119, _C_) become detached on the slightest\r\nprovocation, and adhere to whatever they touch with great tenacity.\r\nThe flowers in this family are arranged in one-sided inflorescences\r\nwhich are coiled up at first and straighten as the flowers expand.\r\n\r\nThe last family (_Solaneæ_) includes the nightshades (_Solanum_)\r\n(Fig. 119, _D_), to which genus the potato (_S. tuberosum_) and the\r\negg-plant (_S. Melongena_) also belong. Many of the family contain a\r\npoisonous principle, _e.g._ the deadly nightshade (_Atropa_), tobacco\r\n(_Nicotiana_), stramonium (_Datura_), and others. Of the cultivated\r\nplants, besides those already mentioned, the tomato (_Lycopersicum_),\r\nand various species of _Petunia_ (Fig. 119, _H_), _Solanum_, and\r\n_Datura_ are the commonest.\r\n\r\nThe second order of the _Anisocarpæ_ consists of plants whose flowers\r\nusually exhibit very marked, bilateral symmetry (_Zygomorphism_). From\r\nthe flower often being two-lipped (see Fig. 120), the name of the\r\norder (_Labiatifloræ_) is derived.\r\n\r\nOf the nine families constituting the order, all but one are\r\nrepresented within our limits, but the great majority belong to two\r\nfamilies, the mints (_Labiatæ_) and the figworts (_Scrophularineæ_).\r\nThe mints are very common and easily recognizable on account of their\r\nsquare stems, opposite leaves, strongly bilabiate flowers, and the\r\novary splitting into four seed-like fruits (Fig. 120, _D_, _F_).\r\n\r\n  The great majority of them, too, have the surface covered with\r\n  glandular hairs secreting a strong-scented volatile oil, giving the\r\n  peculiar odor to these plants. The dead nettle (_Lamium_) (Fig. 120,\r\n  _A_) is a thoroughly typical example. The sage, mints, catnip,\r\n  thyme, lavender, etc., will recall the peculiarities of the family.\r\n\r\nThe stamens are usually four in number through the abortion of one of\r\nthem, but sometimes only two perfect stamens are present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--_Anisocarpous sympetalæ_ (_Labiatifloræ_).\r\n_A_, dead nettle, _Lamium_, (_Labiatæ_), × ½. _B_, a single flower,\r\n× 1. _C_, the stamens and pistil, × 1. _D_, cross-section of the\r\novary, × 2. _E_, diagram of the flower; the position of the absent\r\nstamen is indicated by the small circle. _F_, fruit of the common\r\nsage, _Salvia_ (_Labiatæ_), × 1.

There are generally four\r\nstamens, two long and two short, as in the labiates, but in the\r\nmullein (_Verbascum_) (Fig. 120, _M_), where the flower is only\r\nslightly zygomorphic, there is a fifth rudimentary stamen, while in\r\nothers (_e.g._ _Veronica_) (Fig. 120, _J_) there are but two stamens.\r\nMany have large, showy flowers, as in the cultivated foxglove\r\n(_Digitalis_), and the native species of _Gerardia_, mullein,\r\n_Mimulus_, etc., while a few like the figwort, _Scrophularia_\r\n(Fig. 120, _H_), and speedwells (_Veronica_) have duller-colored or\r\nsmaller flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--_Anisocarpous sympetalæ_ (_Labiatifloræ_).\r\n_A_, flowering branch of trumpet-creeper, _Tecoma_ (_Bignoniaceæ_),\r\n× ¼. _B_, a single flower, divided lengthwise, × ½. _C_, cross-section\r\nof the ovary, × 2. _D_, diagram of the flower. _E_, flower of vervain,\r\n_Verbena_ (_Verbenæ_), × 2: i, from the side; ii, from in front; iii,\r\nthe corolla laid open. _F_, nearly ripe fruit of the same, × 2. _G_,\r\npart of a spike of flowers of the common plantain, _Plantago_\r\n(_Plantagineæ_), × 1; The upper flowers have the pistils mature, but\r\nthe stamens are not yet ripe. _H_, a flower from the upper (younger)\r\npart of the spike. _I_, an older expanded flower, with ripe stamens,\r\n× 3.]\r\n\r\nThe curious bladder-weed (_Utricularia_) is the type of the family\r\n_Lentibulariaceæ_, aquatic or semi-aquatic plants which possess\r\nspecial contrivances for capturing insects or small water animals.\r\nThese in the bladder-weed are little sacs (Fig. 120, _P_) which act as\r\ntraps from which the animals cannot escape after being captured. There\r\ndoes not appear to be here any actual digestion, but simply an\r\nabsorption of the products of decomposition, as in the pitcher-plant.\r\nIn the nearly related land form, _Pinguicula_, however, there is much\r\nthe same arrangement as in the sundew.\r\n\r\nThe family _Gesneraceæ_ is mainly a tropical one, represented in the\r\ngreenhouses by the magnificent _Gloxinia_ and _Achimenes_, but of\r\nnative plants there are only a few parasitic forms destitute of\r\nchlorophyll and with small, inconspicuous flowers. The commonest of\r\nthese is _Epiphegus_, a much-branched, brownish plant, common in\r\nautumn about the roots of beech-trees upon which it is parasitic, and\r\nwhence it derives its common name, \"beech-drops.\"\r\n\r\nThe bignonia family (_Bignoniaceæ_) is mainly tropical, but in our\r\nsouthern states is represented by the showy trumpet-creeper (_Tecoma_)\r\n(Fig. 121, _A_), the catalpa, and _Martynia_.\r\n\r\nThe other plants likely to be met with by the student belong either to\r\nthe _Verbenaceæ_, represented by the showy verbenas of the gardens,\r\nand our much less showy wild vervains, also belonging to the genus\r\n_Verbena_ (Fig. 121, _E_); or to the plantain family (_Plantagineæ_),\r\nof which the various species of plantain (_Plantago_) are familiar to\r\nevery one (Fig. 121, _G_, _I_). The latter seem to be forms in which\r\nthe flowers have become inconspicuous, and are wind fertilized, while\r\nprobably all of its showy-flowered relatives are dependent on insects\r\nfor fertilization.\r\n\r\nThe third order (_Contortæ_) of the _Anisocarpæ_ includes five\r\nfamilies, all represented by familiar forms. The first, the olive\r\nfamily (_Oleaceæ_), besides the olive, contains the lilac and jasmine\r\namong cultivated plants, and the various species of ash (_Fraxinus_),\r\nand the pretty fringe-tree (_Chionanthus_) (Fig. 122, _A_), often\r\ncultivated for its abundant white flowers. The other families are the\r\n_Gentianaceæ_ including the true gentians (_Gentiana_) (Fig. 122,\r\n_F_), the buck-bean (_Menyanthes_), the centauries (_Erythræa_ and\r\n_Sabbatia_), and several other less familiar genera; _Loganiaceæ_,\r\nwith the pink-root (_Spigelia_) (Fig. 122, _D_), as the best-known\r\nexample; _Apocynaceæ_ including the dog-bane (_Apocynum_) (Fig. 122,\r\n_H_), and in the gardens the oleander and periwinkle (_Vinca_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--_Anisocarpous sympetalæ_ (_Contortæ_). _A_,\r\nflower of fringe-tree, _Chionanthus_ (_Oleaceæ_), × 1. _B_, base of\r\nthe flower, with part of the calyx and corolla removed, × 2. _C_,\r\nfruit of white ash, _Fraxinus_ (_Oleaceæ_), × 1. _D_, flower of\r\npink-root, _Spigelia_ (_Loganiaceæ_), × ½. _E_, cross-section of the\r\novary, × 3. _F_, flower of fringed gentian, _Gentiana_ (_Gentianaceæ_),\r\n× ½. _G_, diagram of the flower. _H_, flowering branch of dog-bane,\r\n_Apocynum_ (_Apocynaceæ_), × ½. _I_, vertical section of a flower,\r\n× 2. _J_, bud. _K_, flower of milk-weed, _Asclepias_ (_Asclepiadaceæ_),\r\n× 1. _L_, vertical section through the upper part of the flower, × 2.\r\n_gy._ pistil. _p_, pollen masses. _an._ stamen. _M_, a pair of pollen\r\nmasses, × 6. _N_, a nearly ripe seed, × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe last family is the milk-weeds (_Asclepiadaceæ_), which have\r\nextremely complicated flowers. Our numerous milk-weeds (Fig. 122, _K_)\r\nare familiar representatives, and exhibit perfectly the peculiarities\r\nof the family. Like the dog-banes, the plants contain a milky juice\r\nwhich is often poisonous. Besides the true milk-weeds (_Asclepias_),\r\nthere are several other genera within the United States, but mostly\r\nsouthern in their distribution. Many of them are twining plants and\r\noccasionally cultivated for their showy flowers. Of the cultivated\r\nforms, the wax-plant (_Hoya_), and _Physianthus_ are the commonest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--_Anisocarpous sympetalæ_ (_Campanulinæ_).\r\n_A_, vertical section of the bud of American bell-flower, _Campanula_\r\n(_Campanulaceæ_), × 2. _B_, an expanded flower, × 1.

The flowers\r\nare usually unisexual, sometimes diœcious, but oftener monœcious\r\n(Fig. 123, _I_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--_Anisocarpous sympetalæ_ (_Aggregatæ_).\r\nTypes of _Compositæ_. _A_, inflorescence of Canada thistle\r\n(_Cirsium_), × 1. _B_, vertical section of _A_. _r_, the receptacle or\r\nenlarged end of the stem, to which the separate flowers are attached.\r\n_C_, a single flower, × 2. _o_, the ovary. _p_, the \"pappus\" (calyx\r\nlobes). _an._ the united anthers. _D_, the upper part of the stamens\r\nand pistil, × 3: i, from a young flower; ii, from an older one. _an._\r\nanthers. _gy._ pistil. _E_, ripe fruit, × 1. _F_, inflorescence of\r\nmay-weed (_Maruta_).

There are six families, five of which have common\r\nrepresentatives, but the last family (_Calycereæ_) has no members\r\nwithin our limits.\r\n\r\nThe lower members of the order, _e.g._ various _Rubiaceæ_ (Fig. 124,\r\n_A_, _E_), have the flowers in loose inflorescences, but as we examine\r\nthe higher families, the tendency for the flowers to become crowded\r\nbecomes more and more evident, and in the highest of our native forms\r\n_Dipsaceæ_ (Fig. 124, _P_) and _Compositæ_ (Fig. 125) this is very\r\nmarked indeed. In the latter family, which is by far the largest of\r\nall the angiosperms, including about ten thousand species, the\r\ndifferentiation is carried still further. Among our native _Compositæ_\r\nthere are three well-marked types. The first of these may be\r\nrepresented by the thistles (Fig. 125, _A_). The so-called flower of\r\nthe thistle is in reality a close head of small, tubular flowers\r\n(Fig. 125, _C_), each perfect in all respects, having an inferior\r\none-celled ovary, five stamens with the anthers united, and a\r\nfive-parted corolla. The sepals (here called the \"pappus\") (_p_) have\r\nthe form of fine hairs. These little flowers are attached to the\r\nenlarged upper end of the flower stalk (receptacle, _r_), and are\r\nsurrounded by closely overlapping bracts or scale leaves which look\r\nlike a calyx; the flowers, on superficial examination, appear as\r\nsingle petals. In other forms like the daisy and may-weed (Fig. 125,\r\n_F_), only the central flowers are perfect, and the edge of the\r\ninflorescence is composed of flowers whose corollas are split and\r\nflattened out, but the stamens and sometimes the pistils are wanting\r\nin these so-called \"ray-flowers.\" In the third group, of which the\r\ndandelion (Fig. 125, _H_), chicory, lettuce, etc., are examples, all\r\nof the flowers have strap-shaped, split corollas, and contain both\r\nstamens and pistils.\r\n\r\nThe families of the _Aggregatæ_ are the following: I. _Rubiaceæ_ of\r\nwhich _Houstonia_ (Fig. 124, _A_), _Galium_ (_E_), _Cephalanthus_\r\n(button-bush), and _Mitchella_ (partridge-berry) are examples;\r\nII. _Caprifoliaceæ_, containing the honeysuckles (_Lonicera_)\r\n(Fig. 124, _I_), _Viburnum_ (_G_), snowberry (_Symphoricarpus_), and\r\nelder (_Sambucus_); III. _Valerianeæ_, represented by the common\r\nvalerian (_Valeriana_) (Fig. 124, _L_); IV. _Dipsaceæ_, of which the\r\nteasel (_Dipsacus_) (Fig. 124, _P_), is the type, and also species of\r\nscabious (_Scabiosa_); V. _Compositæ_ to which the innumerable,\r\nso-called compound flowers, asters, golden-rods, daisies, sunflowers,\r\netc. belong; VI. _Calycereæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--_Aristolochiaceæ_. _A_, plant of wild ginger\r\n(_Asarum_), × ⅓. _B_, vertical section of the flower, × 1. _C_,\r\ndiagram of the flower.]\r\n\r\nBesides the groups already mentioned, there are several families of\r\ndicotyledons whose affinities are very doubtful. They are largely\r\nparasitic, _e.g._ mistletoe; or water plants, as the horned pond-weed\r\n(_Ceratophyllum_). One family, the _Aristolochiaceæ_, represented by\r\nthe curious \"Dutchman's pipe\" (_Aristolochia sipho_), a woody twiner\r\nwith very large leaves, and the common wild ginger (_Asarum_)\r\n(Fig. 126), do not appear to be in any wise parasitic, but the\r\nstructure of their curious flowers differs widely from any other group\r\nof plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nFERTILIZATION OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we compare the flowers of different plants, we shall find almost\r\ninfinite variety in structure, and this variation at first appears to\r\nfollow no fixed laws; but as we study the matter more thoroughly, we\r\nfind that these variations have a deep significance, and almost\r\nwithout exception have to do with the fertilization of the flower.\r\n\r\nIn the simpler flowers, such as those of a grass, sedge, or rush among\r\nthe monocotyledons, or an oak, hazel, or plantain, among dicotyledons,\r\nthe flowers are extremely inconspicuous and often reduced to the\r\nsimplest form. In such plants, the pollen is conveyed from the male\r\nflowers to the female by the wind, and to this end the former are\r\nusually placed above the latter so that these are dusted with the\r\npollen whenever the plant is shaken by the wind. In these plants, the\r\nmale flowers often outnumber the female enormously, and the pollen is\r\nproduced in great quantities, and the stigmas are long and often\r\nfeathery, so as to catch the pollen readily. This is very beautifully\r\nshown in many grasses.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we examine the higher groups of flowering plants, we see\r\nthat the outer leaves of the flower become more conspicuous, and that\r\nthis is often correlated with the development of a sweet fluid\r\n(nectar) in certain parts of the flower, while the wind-fertilized\r\nflowers are destitute of this as well as of odor.\r\n\r\nIf we watch any bright-colored or sweet-scented flower for any length\r\nof time, we shall hardly fail to observe the visits of insects to it,\r\nin search of pollen or honey, and attracted to the flower by its\r\nbright color or sweet perfume. In its visits from flower to flower,\r\nthe insect is almost certain to transfer part of the pollen carried\r\noff from one flower to the stigma of another of the same kind, thus\r\neffecting pollination.\r\n\r\nThat the fertilization of a flower by pollen from another is\r\nbeneficial has been shown by many careful experiments which show that\r\nnearly always--at least in flowers where there are special\r\ncontrivances for cross-fertilization--the number of seeds is greater\r\nand the quality better where cross-fertilization has taken place, than\r\nwhere the flower is fertilized by its own pollen. From these\r\nexperiments, as well as from very numerous studies on the structure of\r\nthe flower with reference to insect aid in fertilization, we are\r\njustified in the conclusion that all bright-colored flowers are, to a\r\ngreat extent, dependent upon insect aid for transferring the pollen\r\nfrom one flower to another, and that many, especially those with\r\ntubular or zygomorphic (bilateral) flowers are perfectly incapable of\r\nself-fertilization. In a few cases snails have been known to be the\r\nconveyers of pollen, and the humming-birds are known in some cases, as\r\nfor instance the trumpet-creeper (Fig. 121, _A_), to take the place of\r\ninsects.[14]\r\n\r\n[14] In a number of plants with showy flowers, _e.g._ violets,\r\njewel-weed, small, inconspicuous flowers are also formed, which are\r\nself-fertilizing. These inconspicuous flowers are called\r\n\"cleistogamous.\"\r\n\r\nAt first sight it would appear that most flowers are especially\r\nadapted for self-fertilization; but in fact, although stamens and\r\npistils are in the same flower, there are usually effective\r\npreventives for avoiding self-fertilization. In a few cases\r\ninvestigated, it has been found that the pollen from the flower will\r\nnot germinate upon its own stigma, and in others it seems to act\r\ninjuriously. One of the commonest means of avoiding self-fertilization\r\nis the maturing of stamens and pistils at different times. Usually the\r\nstamens ripen first, discharging the pollen and withering before the\r\nstigma is ready to receive it, _e.g._ willow-herb (Fig. 113, _D_),\r\ncampanula (Fig. 123, _A_, _D_), and pea; in the two latter, the pollen\r\nis often shed before the flower opens. Not so frequently the stigmas\r\nmature first, as in the plantain (Fig. 121, _G_).\r\n\r\nIn many flowers, the stamens, as they ripen, move so as to place\r\nthemselves directly before the entrance to the nectary, where they are\r\nnecessarily struck by any insect searching for honey; after the pollen\r\nis shed, they move aside or bend downward, and their place is taken by\r\nthe pistil, so that an insect which has come from a younger flower\r\nwill strike the part of the body previously dusted with pollen against\r\nthe stigma, and deposit the pollen upon it. This arrangement is very\r\nbeautifully seen in the nasturtium and larkspur (Fig. 99, _J_).\r\n\r\nThe tubular flowers of the _Sympetalæ_ are especially adapted for\r\npollination by insects with long tongues, like the bees and\r\nbutterflies, and in most of these flowers the relative position of the\r\nstamens and pistil is such as to ensure cross-fertilization, which in\r\nthe majority of them appears to be absolutely dependent upon insect\r\naid.\r\n\r\nThe great orchid family is well known on account of the singular form\r\nand brilliant colors of the flowers which have no equals in these\r\nrespects in the whole vegetable kingdom. As might be expected, there\r\nare numerous contrivances for cross-fertilization among them, some of\r\nwhich are so extraordinary as to be scarcely credible. With few\r\nexceptions the pollen is so placed as to render its removal by insects\r\nnecessary. One of the simpler contrivances is readily studied in the\r\nlittle spring-orchis (Fig. 89) or one of the _Habenarias_ (Fig. 90,\r\n_G_). In the first, the two pollen masses taper below where each is\r\nattached to a viscid disc which is covered by a delicate membrane.\r\nThese discs are so placed that when an insect enters the flower and\r\nthrusts its tongue into the spur of the flower, its head is brought\r\nagainst the membrane covering the discs, rupturing it so as to expose\r\nthe disc which adheres firmly to the head or tongue of the insect,\r\nthe substance composing the disc hardening like cement on exposure to\r\nthe air. As the insect withdraws its tongue, one or both of the pollen\r\nmasses are dragged out and carried away. The action of the insect may\r\nbe imitated by thrusting a small grass-stalk or some similar body into\r\nthe spur of the flower, when on withdrawing it, the two pollen masses\r\nwill be removed from the flower. If we now examine these carefully, we\r\nshall see that they change position, being nearly upright at first,\r\nbut quickly bending downward and forward (Fig. 89, _D_, ii, iii), so\r\nthat on thrusting the stem into another flower the pollen masses\r\nstrike against the sticky stigmatic surfaces, and a part of the pollen\r\nis left adhering to them.\r\n\r\nThe last arrangement that will be mentioned here is one discovered by\r\nDarwin in a number of very widely separated plants, and to which he\r\ngave the name \"heterostylism.\" Examples of this are the primroses\r\n(_Primula_), loosestrife (_Lythrum_), partridge-berry (_Mitchella_),\r\npickerel-weed (_Pontederia_), (Fig. 84, _I_), and others. In these\r\nthere are two, sometimes three, sets of flowers differing very much in\r\nthe relative lengths of stamens and pistil, those with long pistils\r\nhaving short stamens and _vice versa_. When an insect visits a flower\r\nwith short stamens, that part is covered with pollen which in the\r\nshort-styled (but long-stamened) flower will strike the stigma, as the\r\npistil in one flower is almost exactly of the length of the stamens in\r\nthe other form. In such flowers as have three forms, _e.g._\r\n_Pontederia_, each flower has two different lengths of stamens, both\r\ndiffering from the style of the same flower. Microscopic examination\r\nhas shown that there is great variation in the size of the pollen\r\nspores in these plants, the large pollen from the long stamens being\r\nadapted to the long style of the proper flower.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that the character of the color of the flower is\r\nrelated to the insects visiting it. Brilliantly colored flowers are\r\nusually visited by butterflies, bees, and similar day-flying insects.\r\nFlowers opening at night are usually white or pale yellow, colors best\r\nseen at night, and in addition usually are very strongly scented so\r\nas to attract the night-flying moths which usually fertilize them.\r\nSometimes dull-colored flowers, which frequently have a very offensive\r\nodor, are visited by flies and other carrion-loving insects, which\r\nserve to convey pollen to them.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, flowers in themselves inconspicuous are surrounded by\r\nshowy leaves or bracts which take the place of the petals of the\r\nshowier flowers in attracting insect visitors. The large dogwood\r\n(Fig. 110, _J_), the calla, and Jack-in-the-pulpit (Fig. 86, _A_) are\r\nillustrations of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nHISTOLOGICAL METHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the more exact investigations of the tissues, it is often necessary\r\nto have recourse to other reagents than those we have used hitherto,\r\nin order to bring out plainly the more obscure points of structure.\r\nThis is especially the case in studies in cell division in the higher\r\nplants, where the changes in the dividing nucleus are very\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\n  For studying these the most favorable examples for ready\r\n  demonstration are found in the final division of the pollen spores,\r\n  especially of some monocotyledons. An extremely good subject is\r\n  offered by the common wild onion (_Allium Canadense_), which flowers\r\n  about the last of May. The buds, which are generally partially\r\n  replaced by small bulbs, are enclosed in a spathe or sheath which\r\n  entirely conceals them. Buds two to three millimetres in length\r\n  should be selected, and these opened so as to expose the anthers.\r\n  The latter should now be removed to a slide, and carefully crushed\r\n  in a drop of dilute acetic acid (one-half acid to one-half\r\n  distilled water). This at once fixes the nuclei, and by examining\r\n  with a low power, we can determine at once whether or not we have\r\n  the right stages. The spore mother cells are recognizable by their\r\n  thick transparent walls, and if the desired dividing stages are\r\n  present, a drop of staining fluid should be added and allowed to act\r\n  for about a minute, the preparation being covered with a cover\r\n  glass. After the stain is sufficiently deep, it should be carefully\r\n  withdrawn with blotting paper, and pure water run under the cover\r\n  glass.\r\n\r\n  The best stain for acetic acid preparations is, perhaps, gentian\r\n  violet. This is an aniline dye readily soluble in water. For our\r\n  purpose, however, it is best to make a concentrated, alcoholic\r\n  solution from the dry powder, and dilute this as it is wanted. A\r\n  drop of the alcoholic solution is diluted with several times its\r\n  volume of weak acetic acid (about two parts of distilled water to\r\n  one of the acid), and a drop of this mixture added to the\r\n  preparation. In this way the nucleus alone is stained and is\r\n  rendered very distinct, appearing of a beautiful violet-blue color.\r\n\r\n  If the preparation is to be kept permanently, the acid must all be\r\n  washed out, and dilute glycerine run under the cover glass. The\r\n  preparation should then be sealed with Canada balsam or some other\r\n  cement, but previously all trace of glycerine must be removed from\r\n  the slide and upper surface of the cover glass. It is generally best\r\n  to gently wipe the edge of the cover glass with a small brush\r\n  moistened with alcohol before applying the cement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--_A_, pollen mother cell of the wild onion.\r\n_n_, nucleus. _B-F_, early stages in the division of the nucleus.\r\n_par._ nucleolus; acetic acid, gentian violet, × 350.]\r\n\r\n  If the spore mother cells are still quite young, we shall find the\r\n  nucleus (Fig. 127, _A_, _n_) comparatively small, and presenting a\r\n  granular appearance when strongly magnified. These granules, which\r\n  appear isolated, are really parts of filaments or segments, which\r\n  are closely twisted together, but scarcely visible in the resting\r\n  nucleus. On one side of the nucleus may usually be seen a large\r\n  nucleolus (called here, from its lateral position, paranucleus), and\r\n  the whole nucleus is sharply separated from the surrounding\r\n  protoplasm by a thin but evident membrane.\r\n\r\n  The first indication of the approaching division of the nucleus is\r\n  an evident increase in size (_B_), and at the same time the colored\r\n  granules become larger, and show more clearly that they are in lines\r\n  indicating the form of the segments. These granules next become more\r\n  or less confluent, and the segments become very evident, appearing\r\n  as deeply stained, much-twisted threads filling the nuclear cavity\r\n  (Fig. 127, _C_), and about this time the nucleolus disappears.\r\n\r\n  The next step is the disappearance of the nuclear membrane so that\r\n  the segments lie apparently free in the protoplasm of the cell. They\r\n  arrange themselves in a flat plate in the middle of the cell, this\r\n  plate appearing, when seen from the side, as a band running across\r\n  the middle of the cell. (Fig. 127, _D_, shows this plate as seen\r\n  from the side, _E_ seen from above.)\r\n\r\n  About the time the nuclear plate is complete, delicate lines may be\r\n  detected in the protoplasm converging at two points on opposite\r\n  sides of the cell, and forming a spindle-shaped figure with the\r\n  nuclear plate occupying its equator. This stage (_D_), is known as\r\n  the \"nuclear spindle.\" The segments of the nuclear plate next divide\r\n  lengthwise into two similar daughter segments (_F_), and these then\r\n  separate, one going to each of the new nuclei. This stage is not\r\n  always to be met with, as it seems to be rapidly passed over, but\r\n  patient search will generally reveal some nuclei in this condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Later stages of nuclear divisions in the\r\npollen mother cell of wild onion, × 350. All the figures are seen from\r\nthe side, except _B_ ii, which is viewed from the pole.]\r\n\r\n  Although this is almost impossible to demonstrate, there are\r\n  probably as many filaments in the nuclear spindle as there are\r\n  segments (in this case about sixteen), and along these the nuclear\r\n  segments travel slowly toward the two poles of the spindle\r\n  (Fig. 128, _A_, _B_). As the two sets of segments separate, they are\r\n  seen to be connected by very numerous, delicate threads, and about\r\n  the time the young nuclei reach the poles of the nuclear spindle,\r\n  the first trace of the division wall appears in the form of isolated\r\n  particles (microsomes), which arise first as thickenings of these\r\n  threads in the middle of the cell, and appear in profile as a line\r\n  of small granules not at first extending across the cell, but later,\r\n  reaching completely across it (Fig. 128, _C_, _E_). These granules\r\n  constitute the young cell wall or \"cell plate,\" and finally coalesce\r\n  to form a continuous membrane (Fig. 128, _F_).\r\n\r\n  The two daughter nuclei pass through the same changes, but in\r\n  reverse order that we saw in the mother nucleus previous to the\r\n  formation of the nuclear plate, and by the time the partition wall\r\n  is complete the nuclei have practically the same structure as the\r\n  first stages we examined (Fig. 128, _F_).[15]\r\n\r\n[15] The division is repeated in the same way in each cell so that\r\nultimately four pollen spores are formed from each of the original\r\nmother cells.\r\n\r\n  This complicated process of nuclear division is known technically as\r\n  \"karyokinesis,\" and is found throughout the higher animals as well\r\n  as plants.\r\n\r\nThe simple method of fixing and staining, just described, while giving\r\nexcellent results in many cases, is not always applicable, nor as a\r\nrule are the permanent preparations so made satisfactory. For\r\npermanent preparations, strong alcohol (for very delicate tissues,\r\nabsolute alcohol, when procurable, is best) is the most convenient\r\nfixing agent, and generally very satisfactory. Specimens may be put\r\ndirectly into the alcohol, and allowed to stay two or three days, or\r\nindefinitely if not wanted immediately. When alcohol does not give\r\ngood results, specimens fixed with chromic or picric acid may\r\ngenerally be used, and there are other fixing agents which will not be\r\ndescribed here, as they will hardly be used by any except the\r\nprofessional botanist. Chromic acid is best used in a watery solution\r\n(five per cent chromic acid, ninety-five per cent distilled water).\r\nFor most purposes a one per cent solution is best; in this the objects\r\nremain from three or four to twenty-four hours, depending on size, but\r\nare not injured by remaining longer. Picric acid is used as a\r\nsaturated solution in distilled water, and the specimen may remain for\r\nabout the same length of time as in the chromic acid. After the\r\nspecimen is properly fixed it must be thoroughly washed in several\r\nwaters, allowing it to remain in the last for twenty-four hours or\r\nmore until all trace of the acid has been removed, otherwise there is\r\nusually difficulty in staining.\r\n\r\nAs staining agents many colors are used. The most useful are\r\nhæmatoxylin, carmine, and various aniline colors, among which may be\r\nmentioned, besides gentian violet, safranine, Bismarck brown, methyl\r\nviolet. Hæmatoxylin and carmine are prepared in various ways, but are\r\nbest purchased ready for use, all dealers in microscopic supplies\r\nhaving them in stock. The aniline colors may be used either dissolved\r\nin alcohol or water, and with all, the best stain, especially of the\r\nnucleus, is obtained by using a very dilute, watery solution, and\r\nallowing the sections to remain for twenty-four hours or so in the\r\nstaining mixture.\r\n\r\nHæmatoxylin and carmine preparations may be mounted either in\r\nglycerine or balsam. (Canada balsam dissolved in chloroform is the\r\nordinary mounting medium.) In using glycerine it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to add the glycerine gradually, allowing the water to slowly\r\nevaporate, as otherwise the specimens will sometimes collapse owing to\r\nthe too rapid extraction of the water from the cells. Aniline colors,\r\nas a rule, will not keep in glycerine, the color spreading and finally\r\nfading entirely, so that with most of them the specimens must be\r\nmounted in balsam.\r\n\r\nGlycerine mounts must be closed, which may be done with Canada balsam\r\nas already described. The balsam is best kept in a wide-mouthed\r\nbottle, specially made for the purpose, which has a glass cap covering\r\nthe neck, and contains a glass rod for applying the balsam.\r\n\r\nBefore mounting in balsam, the specimen must be completely freed from\r\nwater by means of absolute alcohol. (Sometimes care must be taken to\r\nbring it gradually into the alcohol to avoid collapsing.[16]) If an\r\naniline stain has been used, it will not do to let it stay more than a\r\nminute or so in the alcohol, as the latter quickly extracts the stain.\r\nAfter dehydrating, the specimen should be placed on a clean slide in a\r\ndrop of clove oil (bergamot or origanum oil is equally good), which\r\nrenders it perfectly transparent, when a drop of balsam should be\r\ndropped upon it, and a perfectly clean cover glass placed over the\r\npreparation. The chloroform in which the balsam is dissolved will soon\r\nevaporate, leaving the object embedded in a transparent film of balsam\r\nbetween the slide and cover glass. No further treatment is necessary.\r\nFor the finer details of nuclear division or similar studies, balsam\r\nmounts are usually preferable.\r\n\r\n[16] For gradual dehydrating, the specimens may be placed\r\nsuccessively in 30 per cent, 50 per cent, 70 per cent, 90 per cent,\r\nand absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes found necessary in sectioning very small and delicate\r\norgans to embed them in some firm substance which will permit\r\nsectioning, but these processes are too difficult and complicated to\r\nbe described here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following books of reference may be recommended.

By ALFRED P. GAGE, A.M.,\r\n  Instructor in Physics in the English High School, Boston. 12mo.\r\n  424 pages. Mailing Price, $1.25; Introduction, $1.12; Allowance for\r\n  old book, 35 cents.\r\n\r\nThis treatise is based upon _the doctrine of the conservation of\r\nenergy_, which is made prominent throughout the work. But the leading\r\nfeature of the book--one that distinguishes it from all others--is,\r\nthat it is strictly _experiment-teaching_ in its method; _i.e._, it\r\nleads the pupil to \"read nature in the language of experiment.\" So far\r\nas practicable, the following plan is adopted: The pupil is expected\r\nto accept as _fact_ only that which he has seen or learned by personal\r\ninvestigation. He himself performs the larger portion of the\r\nexperiments with _simple_ and _inexpensive_ apparatus, such as, in a\r\nmajority of cases, is in his power to construct with the aid of\r\ndirections given in the book. The experiments given are rather of the\r\nnature of _questions_ than of illustrations, and _precede_ the\r\nstatements of principles and laws. Definitions and laws are not given\r\nuntil the pupil has acquired a knowledge of his subject sufficient to\r\nenable him to construct them for himself. The aim of the book is to\r\nlead the pupil _to observe and to think_.\r\n\r\nC. F. EMERSON, _Prof. of Physics, Dartmouth College_: It takes up the\r\nsubject on the right plan, and presents it in a clear, yet scientific,\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWM. NOETLING, _Prof. of Rhetoric, Theory and Practice of Teaching,\r\nState Normal School, Bloomsburg, Pa._: Every page of the book shows\r\nthat the author is a _real_ teacher and that he knows how to make\r\npupils think. I know of no other work on the subject of which this\r\ntreats that I can so unreservedly recommend to all wide-awake teachers\r\nas this.\r\n\r\nB. F. WRIGHT, _Supt. of Public Schools, St. Paul, Minn._: I like it\r\nbetter than any text-book on physics I have seen.\r\n\r\nO. H. ROBERTS, _Prin. of High School, San Jose, Cal._: Gage's Physics\r\nis giving great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction to Physical Science._\r\n\r\n  By A. P. GAGE, Instructor in Physics in the English High School,\r\n  Boston, Mass., and Author of _Elements of Physics_, etc. 12mo.\r\n  Cloth. viii + 353 pages. With a chart of colors and spectra. Mailing\r\n  Price, $1.10; for introduction, $1.00; allowance for an old book in\r\n  exchange, 30 cents.\r\n\r\nThe great and constantly increasing popularity of Gage's _Elements of\r\nPhysics_ has created a demand for an equally good but easier book, on\r\nthe same plan, suitable for schools that can give but a limited time\r\nto the study. The _Introduction to Physical Science_ has been prepared\r\nto supply this demand.\r\n\r\nACCURACY is the prime requisite in scientific text-books. A false\r\nstatement is not less false because it is plausible, nor an\r\ninconclusive experiment more satisfactory because it is diverting. In\r\nbooks of entertainment, such things may be permissible; but in a\r\ntext-book, the first essentials are correctness and accuracy. It is\r\nbelieved that the _Introduction_ will stand the closest expert\r\nscrutiny. Especial care has been taken to restrict the use of\r\nscientific terms, such as _force_, _energy_, _power_, etc., to their\r\nproper significations. Terms like _sound_, _light_, _color_, etc.,\r\nwhich have commonly been applied to both the effect and the agent\r\nproducing the effect have been rescued from this ambiguity.\r\n\r\nRECENT ADVANCES in physics have been faithfully recorded, and the\r\nrelative practical importance of the various topics has been taken\r\ninto account. Among the new features are a full treatment of electric\r\nlighting, and descriptions of storage batteries, methods of\r\ntransmitting electric energy, simple and easy methods of making\r\nelectrical measurements with inexpensive apparatus, the compound\r\nsteam-engine, etc. Static electricity, which is now generally regarded\r\nas of comparatively little importance, is treated briefly; while\r\ndynamic electricity, the most potent and promising physical element of\r\nour modern civilization, is placed in the clearest light of our\r\npresent knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn INTEREST AND AVAILABILITY the _Introduction_ will, it is believed,\r\nbe found no less satisfactory. The wide use of the _Elements_ under\r\nthe most varied conditions, and, in particular, the author's own\r\nexperience in teaching it, have shown how to improve where improvement\r\nwas possible. The style will be found suited to the grades that will\r\nuse the book. The experiments are varied, interesting, clear, and of\r\npractical significance, as well as simple in manipulation and ample in\r\nnumber. Certain subjects that are justly considered difficult and\r\nobscure have been omitted; as, for instance, certain laws relating to\r\nthe pressure of gases and the polarization of light. The\r\n_Introduction_ is even more fully illustrated than the _Elements_.\r\n\r\nIN GENERAL. The _Introduction_, like the _Elements_, has this distinct\r\nand distinctive aim,--to elucidate science, instead of \"popularizing\"\r\nit; to make it liked for its own sake, rather than for its gilding and\r\ncoating; and, while teaching the facts, to impart the spirit of\r\nscience,--that is to say, the spirit of our civilization and progress.\r\n\r\nGEORGE E. GAY, _Prin. of High School, Malden, Mass._: With the matter,\r\nboth the topics and their presentation, I am better pleased than with\r\nany other Physics I have seen.\r\n\r\nR. H. PERKINS, _Supt. of Schools, Chicopee, Mass._: I have no doubt we\r\ncan adopt it as early as next month, and use the same to great\r\nadvantage in our schools. (_Feb. 6, 1888._)\r\n\r\nMARY E. HILL, _Teacher of Physics, Northfield Seminary, Mass._: I like\r\nthe truly scientific method and the clearness with which the subject\r\nis presented. It seems to me admirably adapted to the grade of work\r\nfor which it is designed. (_Mar. 5, '88._)\r\n\r\nJOHN PICKARD, _Prin. of Portsmouth High School, N.H._: I like it\r\nexceedingly. It is clear, straightforward, practical, and not too\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\nEZRA BRAINERD, _Pres. and Prof. of Physics, Middlebury College, Vt._:\r\nI have looked it over carefully, and regard it as a much better book\r\nfor high schools than the former work. (_Feb. 6, 1888._)\r\n\r\nJAMES A. DE BOER, _Prin. of High School, Montpelier, Vt._: I have not\r\nonly examined, but studied it, and consider it superior as a text-book\r\nto any other I have seen. (_Feb. 10, '88._)\r\n\r\nE. B. ROSA, _Teacher of Physics, English and Classical School,\r\nProvidence, R.I._: I think it the best thing in that grade published,\r\nand intend to use it another year. (_Feb. 23, '88._)\r\n\r\nG. H. PATTERSON, _Prin. and Prof. of Physics, Berkeley Sch.,\r\nProvidence, R.I._: A very practical book by a practical teacher.\r\n(_Feb. 2, 1888._)\r\n\r\nGEORGE E. BEERS, _Prin. of Evening High School, Bridgeport, Conn._:\r\nThe more I see of Professor Gage's books, the better I like them. They\r\nare popular, and at the same time scientific, plain and simple, full\r\nand complete. (_Feb. 18, 1888._)\r\n\r\nARTHUR B. CHAFFEE, _Prof. in Franklin College, Ind._: I am very much\r\npleased with the new book. It will suit the average class better than\r\nthe old edition.\r\n\r\nW. D. KERLIN, _Supt. of Public Schools, New Castle, Ind._: I find that\r\nit is the best adapted to the work which we wish to do in our high\r\nschool of any book brought to my notice.\r\n\r\nC. A. BRYANT, _Supt. of Schools, Paris, Tex._: It is just the book for\r\nhigh schools. I shall use it next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction to Chemical Science._\r\n\r\n  By R. P. WILLIAMS, Instructor in Chemistry in the English High\r\n  School, Boston. 12mo. Cloth. 216 pages. Mailing Price, 90 cents; for\r\n  introduction, 80 cents; Allowance for old book in exchange,\r\n  25 cents.\r\n\r\nIn a word, this is a working chemistry--brief but adequate. Attention\r\nis invited to a few special features:--\r\n\r\n1. This book is characterized by directness of treatment, by the\r\nselection, so far as possible, of the most interesting and practical\r\nmatter, and by the omission of what is unessential.\r\n\r\n2. Great care has been exercised to combine clearness with accuracy of\r\nstatement, both of theories and of facts, and to make the explanations\r\nboth lucid and concise.\r\n\r\n3. The three great classes of chemical compounds--acids, bases, and\r\nsalts--are given more than usual prominence, and the arrangement and\r\ntreatment of the subject-matter relating to them is believed to be a\r\nfeature of special merit.\r\n\r\n4. The most important experiments and those best illustrating the\r\nsubjects to which they relate, have been selected; but the modes of\r\nexperimentation are so simple that most of them can be performed by\r\nthe average pupil without assistance from the teacher.\r\n\r\n5. The necessary apparatus and chemicals are less expensive than those\r\nrequired for any other text-book equally comprehensive.\r\n\r\n6. The special inductive feature of the work consists in calling\r\nattention, by query and suggestion, to the most important phenomena\r\nand inferences. This plan is consistently adhered to.\r\n\r\n7. Though the method is an advanced one, it has been so simplified\r\nthat pupils experience no difficulty, but rather an added interest, in\r\nfollowing it; the author himself has successfully employed it in\r\nclasses so large that the simplest and most practical plan has been a\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n8. The book is thought to be comprehensive enough for high schools and\r\nacademies, and for a preparatory course in colleges and professional\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n9. Those teachers in particular who have little time to prepare\r\nexperiments for pupils, or whose experience in the laboratory has been\r\nlimited, will find the simplicity of treatment and of experimentation\r\nwell worth their careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThose who try the book find its merits have not been overstated.\r\n\r\nA. B. AUBERT, _Prof. of Chemistry, Maine State College, Orono, Me._:\r\nAll the salient points are well explained, the theories are treated of\r\nwith great simplicity; it seems as if every student might thoroughly\r\nunderstand the science of chemistry when taught from such a work.\r\n\r\nH. T. FULLER, _Pres. of Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, Mass._: It\r\nis clear, concise, and suggests the most important and most\r\nsignificant experiments for illustration of general principles.\r\n\r\nALFRED S. ROE, _Prin. of High School, Worcester, Mass._: I am very\r\nmuch pleased with it. I think it the most practical book for actual\r\nwork that I have seen.\r\n\r\nFRANK M. GILLEY, _Science Teacher, High School, Chelsea, Mass._: I\r\nhave examined the proof-sheets in connection with my class work, and\r\nafter comparison with a large number of text-books, feel convinced\r\nthat it is superior to any yet published.\r\n\r\nG. S. FELLOWS, _Teacher of Chemistry, High School, Washington, D.C._:\r\nThe author's method seems to us the ideal one. Not only are the\r\ntheoretical parts rendered clear by experiments performed by the\r\nstudent himself, but there is a happy blending of theoretical and\r\napplied chemistry as commendable as it is unusual.\r\n\r\nJ. I. D. HINES, _Prof. of Chemistry, Cumberland University, Lebanon,\r\nTenn._: I am very much pleased with it, and think it will give the\r\nstudent an admirable introduction to the science of chemistry.\r\n\r\nHORACE PHILLIPS, _Prin. of High School, Elkhart, Ind._: My class has\r\nnow used it three months. It proves the most satisfactory text-book in\r\nthis branch that I have ever used. The cost of apparatus and material\r\nis very small.\r\n\r\nO. S. WESCOTT, _Prin. North Division H. Sch., Chicago_: My chemistry\r\nprofessor says it is the most satisfactory thing he has seen, and\r\nhopes we may be able to have it in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laboratory Manual of General Chemistry._\r\n\r\n  By R. P. WILLIAMS, Instructor in Chemistry, English High School,\r\n  Boston, and author of _Introduction to Chemical Science_. 12mo.\r\n  Boards. xvi + 200 pages. Mailing Price, 30 cents; for Introduction,\r\n  25 cents.\r\n\r\nThis Manual, prepared especially to accompany the author's\r\n_Introduction to Chemical Science_, but suitable for use with any\r\ntext-book of chemistry, gives directions for performing one hundred of\r\nthe more important experiments in general chemistry and metal\r\nanalysis, with blanks and a model for the same, lists of apparatus and\r\nchemicals, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Manual is commended as well-designed, simple, convenient, and\r\ncheap,--a practical book that classes in chemistry need.\r\n\r\nW. M. STINE, _Prof. of Chemistry, Ohio University, Athens, O._: It is\r\na work that has my heartiest endorsement. I consider it thoroughly\r\npedagogical in its principles, and its use must certainly give the\r\nstudent the greatest benefit from his chemical drill. (_Dec. 30,\r\n1888._)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Young's General Astronomy._\r\n\r\n  A Text-book for colleges and technical schools. By CHARLES A. YOUNG,\r\n  Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of Astronomy in the College of New Jersey,\r\n  and author of _The Sun_, etc. 8vo. viii + 551 pages. Half-morocco.\r\n  Illustrated with over 250 cuts and diagrams, and supplemented with\r\n  the necessary tables. Introduction Price, $2.25. Allowance for an\r\n  old book in exchange, 40 cents.\r\n\r\nThe OBJECT of the author has been twofold. First and chiefly, to make\r\na book adapted for use in the college class-room; and, secondly, to\r\nmake one valuable as a permanent storehouse and directory of\r\ninformation for the student's use after he has finished his prescribed\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe METHOD of treatment corresponds with the object of the book.\r\nTruth, accuracy, and order have been aimed at first, with clearness\r\nand freedom from ambiguity.\r\n\r\nIn AMOUNT, the work has been adjusted as closely as possible to the\r\nprevailing courses of study in our colleges. The fine print may be\r\nomitted from the regular lessons and used as collateral reading. It is\r\nimportant to anything like a complete view of the subject, but not\r\nessential to a course. Some entire chapters can be omitted, if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nNEW TOPICS, as indicated above, have received a full share of\r\nattention, and while the book makes no claims to novelty, the name of\r\nthe author is a guarantee of much originality both of matter and\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe book will be found especially well adapted for high school and\r\nacademy teachers who desire a work for reference in supplementing\r\ntheir brief courses. The illustrations are mostly new, and prepared\r\nexpressly for this work. The tables in the appendix are from the\r\nlatest and most trustworthy sources. A very full and carefully\r\nprepared index will be found at the end.\r\n\r\nThe eminence of Professor Young as an original investigator in\r\nastronomy, a lecturer and writer on the subject, and an instructor of\r\ncollege classes, and his scrupulous care in preparing this volume, led\r\nthe publishers to present the work with the highest confidence; and\r\nthis confidence has been fully justified by the event. More than one\r\nhundred colleges adopted the work within a year from its publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Young's Elements of Astronomy._\r\n\r\n  A Text-Book for use in High Schools and Academies. With a\r\n  Uranography. By CHARLES A. YOUNG, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of\r\n  Astronomy in the College of New Jersey (Princeton), and author of _A\r\n  General Astronomy_, _The Sun_, etc. 12mo. Half leather. x + 472\r\n  pages, and four star maps. Mailing Price, $1.55; for Introduction,\r\n  $1.40; allowance for old book in exchange, 30 cents.\r\n\r\n_Uranography._\r\n\r\n  From Young's Elements of Astronomy. 12mo. Flexible covers. 42 pages,\r\n  besides four star maps. By mail, 35 cents; for Introduction,\r\n  30 cents.\r\n\r\nThis volume is a new work, and not a mere abridgment of the author's\r\n_General Astronomy_. Much of the material of the larger book has\r\nnaturally been incorporated in this, and many of its illustrations are\r\nused; but everything has been worked over, with reference to the high\r\nschool course.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention has been paid to making all statements correct and\r\naccurate _as far as they go_. Many of them are necessarily incomplete,\r\non account of the elementary character of the work; but it is hoped\r\nthat this incompleteness has never been allowed to become untruth, and\r\nthat the pupil will not afterwards have to unlearn anything the book\r\nhas taught him.\r\n\r\nIn the text no mathematics higher than elementary algebra and geometry\r\nis introduced; in the foot-notes and in the Appendix an occasional\r\ntrigonometric formula appears, for the benefit of the very\r\nconsiderable number of high school students who understand such\r\nexpressions. This fact should be particularly noted, for it is a\r\nspecial aim of the book to teach astronomy scientifically without\r\nrequiring more knowledge and skill in mathematics than can be expected\r\nof high school pupils.\r\n\r\nMany things of real, but secondary, importance have been treated of in\r\nfine print; and others which, while they certainly ought to be found\r\nwithin the covers of a high school text-book of astronomy, are not\r\nessential to the course, are relegated to the Appendix.\r\n\r\nA brief URANOGRAPHY is also presented, covering the constellations\r\nvisible in the United States, with maps on a scale sufficient for the\r\neasy identification of all the principal stars. It includes also a\r\nlist of such telescopic objects in each constellation as are easily\r\nfound and lie within the power of a small telescope.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plant Organization._\r\n\r\n  By R. HALSTED WARD, M.D., F.R.M.S., Professor of Botany in the\r\n  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y. Quarto. 176 pages.\r\n  Illustrated. Flexible boards. Mailing Price, 85 cents; for Introd.,\r\n  75 cents.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a synoptical review of the general structure and\r\nmorphology of plants, clearly drawn out according to biological\r\nprinciples, fully illustrated, and accompanied by a set of blanks for\r\nwritten exercises by pupils. The plan is designed to encourage close\r\nobservation, exact knowledge, and precise statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Primer of Botany._\r\n\r\n  By Mrs. A. A. KNIGHT, of Robinson Seminary, Exeter, N.H. 12mo.\r\n  Boards.
