Y., _January 31, 1917_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Honorable Board of Control of the New York Agricultural\r\n  Experiment Station_:\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript of\r\nthe fifth in our series of fruit-publications, to be known as \"The\r\nPeaches of New York,\" and to constitute Part II of the report of this\r\ninstitution for 1916.\r\n\r\nPeach-growing is an important industry in the State of New York. In\r\ncertain counties the production of this fruit has been a main factor in\r\nthe well-known prosperity of many owners of peach-orchards. Moreover,\r\nthe peach, when at its best, is a luscious article of food and adds\r\ngreatly not only to the enjoyment, but to the healthfulness, of our\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\nThe commercial and dietary importance of the peach is, therefore, the\r\njustification for the preparation of this volume.\r\n\r\nBecause the numerous varieties of peaches differ greatly in quality and\r\nin their adaptation to varying conditions, a comprehensive study of\r\nthose varieties which are, or which may be, grown in this State seemed\r\ngreatly worth while.\r\n\r\nIt is with a feeling of satisfaction, even of pride, that I submit to\r\nyou the accompanying manuscript. Its preparation reflects great credit\r\nupon Prof. Hedrick and his associates and upon the makers of the plates.\r\n\r\n  W. H. JORDAN,\r\n\r\n  _Director_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present volume is the fifth in the plan of the New York\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station to make a more or less complete record\r\nof all of the different fruits grown in this region. This work differs\r\nfrom the preceding fruit-books but little or not at all in nature\r\nand purposes, yet a statement of its contents, even though it be\r\nalmost identical with that in the prefaces of the preceding volumes,\r\nis necessary for those who may not have the other books and may be a\r\nconvenience to those who have all of the series.\r\n\r\nThe title implies that _The Peaches of New York_ is written for the\r\nconfines of a state; but all varieties of the peach grown in North\r\nAmerica, as well as many known only in other continents, Europe\r\nespecially, have been considered, under the supposition that all might\r\nbe grown in New York and are therefore of interest to the peach-growers\r\nof the State. Broadly speaking, then, the design is to make the book as\r\ncomplete a record as possible of the development of the peach, wherever\r\ngrown, up to this time.\r\n\r\nThe book contains: An account of the history and uses of the peach; a\r\ndiscussion of the botanical characters of the species of cultivated\r\npeaches; an account of the peach-regions and of peach-growing in New\r\nYork with the most important statistics relating to this fruit; and,\r\nlastly and in greatest detail, the synonymy, bibliography, economic\r\nstatus, and full descriptions of all the most important cultivated\r\npeaches, with briefer notices of varieties of minor importance and of\r\nthose appearing in peach-literature which are now no longer grown.\r\nIn foot-notes running through the text, biographical sketches are\r\npublished of the persons who have done most in America toward improving\r\nthe peach. Incidentally, all that was thought would be helpful in\r\nbreeding peaches was included. So, too, whatever appeared to be of\r\ninterest to students of ecology has been given a place.\r\n\r\nAs in the preceding books, color-plates occupy prominent places in this\r\nvolume. Pains and expense have not been spared in the attempt to make\r\nthe plates the best possible with the present knowledge of reproduction\r\nin colors. All who have seen the plates in this and the first four\r\nfruit-books of the series will agree that the reproductions of peaches\r\nare more accurate than those of the apples, grapes, plums or cherries,\r\nand yet these are not as exact as might be wished. Although most\r\ncarefully selected, an illustration of one or two fruits does not give\r\nan adequate picture of a variety. Neither does the camera take colors\r\nquite as the eye sees them nor can the plate-maker quite reproduce what\r\nthe camera takes. The illustrations are of life-size as the peaches\r\ngrow on the grounds of this Station and represent specimens of average\r\nsize and color. The fruits, as shown in the plates, look small for the\r\nreason that a flat picture of a round object minifies size.\r\n\r\nIn all of these fruit-books it has been difficult to decide what\r\nvarieties merit color-plates and full descriptions. Briefly, the choice\r\nof sorts to be illustrated and described in detail has been determined\r\nby the following considerations: (1) By the value of the variety for\r\nhome or commercial orchards; (2) the probable value if the peach is a\r\nnew sort on probation; (3) its desirability as a parent in breeding\r\nnew peaches or to show combinations of varieties, to illustrate\r\nnew characters, or to show the range in variation--in a word to\r\nenlighten the peach-breeder; (4) not a few varieties are described and\r\nillustrated to show the trend of peach-evolution--for their historical\r\nvalue; (5) to show relationships of varieties.\r\n\r\nThe peach is profoundly influenced by soil, climate and culture, and a\r\ndiscussion of its status is not complete without taking full account of\r\nthe environment in which it is growing. For this reason, chiefly, the\r\npeach-regions and peach-growing in New York are discussed as fully as\r\nspace permits. This part of the book is designed, also, to serve the\r\nprospective peach-planter in this State in the selection of locations\r\nand soils and in the culture of the peach. Since the cultivation of any\r\nplant changes from year to year, though, experiment station bulletins\r\nand circulars and treatises on the culture of the peach should supply\r\ngrowers of this fruit with better information on the year-to-year\r\nmanagement of the peach-plantation.\r\n\r\nThe botany of the peach, as compared with its congeners, the plum\r\nand the cherry, is simple, indeed, and is well agreed upon by\r\nbotanical writers, so that this book may be said to be almost wholly a\r\nhorticultural one. Yet the few pages devoted to the botany of the peach\r\nmay make plainer, to the horticulturist at least, the botany of this\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe chief contribution _The Peaches of New York_ makes to pomology\r\nis in the descriptions of varieties it contains. All who grow or\r\nuse peaches are dependent on descriptions of fruit and tree for the\r\nidentification of varieties. From a well-written description one should\r\nget an exact mental picture of the fruit--we try to present such a\r\npen-picture. With a few exceptions the descriptions of major varieties\r\nhave been made from peaches growing on the Station grounds, though in\r\nmany cases fruits from several localities have been compared with those\r\ngrown at home.\r\n\r\nThe fruits, it must be said at once, have been described with other\r\nends in view than identification. Chief of these is the effort to set\r\nforth the elementary characters, or unit-characters, of the peach. It\r\nis now certain that the characters of plants are independent entities\r\nthrown into various relationships with each other in individual plants.\r\nOn this conception of unit-characters the improvement of plants is\r\nfounded. An important part of the work in describing fruits has been\r\nto discover what seem to be unit-characters in peaches, thereby aiding\r\nin building a foundation in breeding peaches. To improve the peach we\r\nmust combine the characters of species and varieties; we must know what\r\nthese are before we can rearrange them in an improved peach.\r\n\r\nIn the marked attention paid to the improvement of plants, following\r\nthe work of Mendel and others, the peach is bound to receive\r\nconsideration. Never was information more needed in regard to the\r\nprocesses that have brought peaches from their primitive condition to\r\ntheir present perfection. We have done our utmost to give all that\r\ncould be learned of the origin and history of varieties with the hope\r\nthat such knowledge may be helpful to those who are trying to improve\r\nthe peach.\r\n\r\nWe wish again to call attention to the great value of definite\r\nknowledge regarding the soils, climates and other environmental\r\nconditions under which species and varieties of fruits thrive.\r\nIt is obvious to all thinking pomologists and biologists that,\r\nwhen the ecological conditions under which the several fruits\r\nand their many varieties are grown can be accurately specified,\r\nvaluable generalizations can be made regarding life-zones and\r\nplant-distribution. In _The Peaches of New York_, as in the preceding\r\nbooks, we state as accurately as possible the regions in which and\r\nthe conditions under which, species and varieties of the peach are\r\nsuccessfully grown.\r\n\r\nSo few species have been considered in _The Peaches of New York_ that\r\nwe have had no need to refer to codes of botanical nomenclature. In\r\nthe use of horticultural names, lacking a better code, we have kept\r\nbefore us the revised rules of the American Pomological Society though\r\nin many cases we have not seen fit to follow these rules as the changes\r\nrequired by their strict observance would augment rather than diminish\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThe references given are those that have been used in ascertaining the\r\nhistory and the economic status or in verifying the description of\r\nthe variety that follows. All of the synonyms created by pomologists\r\nto whose works we have had access have been noted but in no case have\r\nwe published synonyms quoted by other writers. The work of reading\r\nreferences and seeking out synonyms is a tremendous one, involving\r\nnearly three years' work for several persons. We hope that this work\r\nsets straight in high degree the great confusion in the names of\r\npeaches, but that we, no matter how painstaking, could bring perfection\r\nout of chaos, no one could expect.\r\n\r\nAgain we call attention to the biographical sketches found in the\r\nfoot-notes. Some men in every profession surpass their fellows in\r\ntrue greatness. Such men there are in pomology, and a knowledge of\r\ntheir career is indispensable to a full comprehension of the industry\r\nof growing fruit. In the conquest of America we have honored, so\r\nfar, only the men who have expressed their energy in conquering the\r\nmines, the forests, the fisheries and to a small degree those who have\r\ndeveloped the soils; we have shamefully neglected the great men who\r\nhave developed our native fruits and vegetables and adapted to the\r\nconditions of the New World the agricultural products of the Old World.\r\nThe brief biographical sketches in these fruit-books are written in an\r\neffort to give in some measure the credit and honor due to those who\r\nhave improved fruits.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of _The Peaches of New York_, besides those whose\r\nnames appear on the title page, I am indebted to R. D. Anthony, for\r\nreading proof; to the Station editor, F. H. Hall, for his assistance;\r\nto the Zeese-Wilkinson Company, New York City, for the beautiful\r\ncolor-plates of peaches; and to the J. B. Lyon Company, Albany, New\r\nYork, for good workmanship in printing the book.\r\n\r\n  U. P.

The beginning of agriculture, as depicted in the\r\ntraditions and embellished in the poetry of ancient peoples, was the\r\ncreation of useful plants by some Divinity. But, counting unwritten\r\nhistory and poetic fancy as naught and coming to recorded facts--those\r\nof history as we now have it--the beginning of agriculture is marked by\r\ntwo recorded events. The first occurred 2700 years B. C. when Emperor\r\nChenming, Ruler of China, instituted ceremonies for the sowing of\r\nvarious vegetables and grains. The second event was the building of the\r\nGreat Pyramid of Gizeh by some ruler who lorded it over Egypt between\r\n2500 to 2000 years B. C. and who ornamented his handiwork with drawings\r\nof figs.\r\n\r\nYet these early records in China and Egypt were not made at the\r\nbeginnings of agriculture in those countries. Plants were undoubtedly\r\ncultivated centuries before it occurred to Emperor Chenming that rice,\r\nwheat and other crops deserved ceremonial sowings. The pyramids of\r\nGizeh could only have been built by an organized, civilized people\r\nwith cultivated fields on which to levy toll for the dormant season\r\nand lean years--pyramids could hardly be raised by a people forced to\r\nskim a day-to-day existence from wild plants. \"Art is long and time\r\nis fleeting\" in agriculture, and between the obscure beginnings of\r\nthis ancient art, when naked men following the chase began to vary a\r\nmeat diet with fruits, grains and roots plucked from the wild, and the\r\nregular cultivation of useful plants, as implied by these old records\r\nfrom China and Egypt, there are many steps and thousands and thousands\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the history of the peach begins with the history of\r\nagriculture, and the beginnings of agriculture are lost in the\r\nobscurity of antiquity, it is useless to speculate as to how long the\r\npeach has been cultivated. The statements of the early historians as to\r\nthe age of the domesticated peach are so at variance that they serve\r\nonly to confuse. Indeed, were we to attempt to bring into agreement the\r\ndiverse assertions of historians we should never know even the place\r\nof origin of the peach; for it is upon data from botany that we must\r\ndepend most in determining the habitat of our fruit. This subject we\r\nnow come to discuss in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE PEACH\r\n\r\nNames frequently breed misunderstandings and in the case of the peach a\r\nfine brood of mistakes as to the origin of the fruit has come from the\r\nname. As all know, \"peach\" and most of its equivalents in the countries\r\nof Europe are derived from \"Persia\" and this has given rise to the\r\nsupposition that the original habitat of the fruit is Persia. The\r\nancient authors who mention the peach, as Theophrastus, Columella and\r\nPliny, agree that the home of the peach was Persia and, even until our\r\nown time, to be written in any of these worthies is proof conclusive.\r\nWhile negative evidence counts for but little, the notion is so firmly\r\nfixed that some, at least, of the races of peaches are Persian products\r\nthat it seems best to clear the way for positive evidence by first\r\nproving that the first home of the peach was not Persia.\r\n\r\nPersia is pictured as a land of fruits before agriculture had begun in\r\nGreece and Rome. The quince and the pomegranate probably originated\r\nhere and, with the olive, grape, almond, and, to the north at least,\r\nthe cherry and plum, have been cultivated from three to four thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt very early times the quince, pomegranate, olive and grape were\r\nintroduced from Persia, according to De Candolle, still our best\r\nauthority, into Greece and Rome and even the cherry and plum, from\r\ncountries to the north if not from Persia, reached southern Europe long\r\nbefore the peach. It seems certain, as De Candolle suggests,[1] that\r\nif the peach had been a native of Persia, had it existed there during\r\nall time, so beautiful and so delectable a fruit would have been taken\r\nearlier into Asia Minor and Greece. As gratifying to all the senses by\r\nwhich we judge fruits as any other product of the orchard, as easily\r\ntransported and propagated as any--more so than most--it cannot be\r\nbelieved that the other fruits named would have been given preference\r\nover the peach by conquerors or travelers carrying Persian luxuries to\r\nwestward countries.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as De Candolle further points out, the several Hebrew\r\nand Sanskrit peoples did not speak in sacred or vulgar writings of\r\nthe peach as they did many times of the olive, quince, grape and\r\npomegranate. Yet these peoples radiated from the valleys of the\r\nEuphrates and were at all times in close communication with Persia.\r\nSince, according to the authoritative De Candolle, Xenophon, who\r\nretreated with the ten thousand 401 B. C., does not mention the peach,\r\nthis fruit probably did not reach Greece until Alexander's expedition\r\nand was first mentioned by Theophrastus 332 B. C. (if the fruit\r\nmentioned by Theophrastus is the peach) and did not reach Rome until\r\nafter the beginning of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe more one examines historical records the more evident it becomes\r\nthat Greek and Roman writers assumed that the habitat of the peach,\r\nwhich they called the Persian apple, was Persia because it came\r\nthence to their countries. Ancient historians very commonly and very\r\nconfusingly made the assumption that the region from which a plant\r\nproduct came to their country was its first habitat.\r\n\r\nThe best means of establishing the origin of a plant is to discover in\r\nwhat country it grows spontaneously. This would be a simple matter,\r\nindeed, if one could be sure that a given plant found growing wild\r\nis not an escape from cultivation. Here is the trouble in the case\r\nof the peach. According to the botanists the tree is now growing\r\nwild in Persia, as it is in nearby countries, and for that matter in\r\nother parts of the Old World and in many places in the New World. The\r\npainstaking De Candolle, who has carefully sifted the evidence of the\r\nleading botanists until his time of writing, 1882, concludes that the\r\npeach has never been truly wild in Persia. An examination of the works\r\nof botanists writing since De Candolle's study of the subject does not\r\nshow that any offers proof that the peach was originally wild in Persia.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the matter further it seems safe to say that the\r\nGreek and Roman writers were at fault in naming Persia as the home\r\nof the peach. To summarize: its late distribution, as compared with\r\nthat of other Persian fruits argues against such an origin; philology,\r\nwhich usually affords indications touching the habitat of a species, is\r\nagainst the Persian theory of origin since neither Hebrew nor Sanskrit\r\nnames the peach; lastly, botany, the most direct means of discovering\r\nthe geographic origin of a plant, offers no positive evidence that\r\nPersia is the home of the peach. The fallacy that the peach comes from\r\nPersia, written in nearly all horticultural and botanical works for\r\n2000 years, now being disposed of, we may take up the claim of China\r\nthat the peach is another of its great gifts to the world.\r\n\r\nA survey of the subject is convincing that the peach comes from China.\r\nNecessarily, such a survey must be brief, yet it is important that no\r\ndoubt be left as to the origin of the peach, thus freeing pomological\r\nliterature from the train of misunderstandings following the current\r\nopinion that part of our peaches, at least, come from Persia. The terms\r\n\"Persian peaches\" and the \"Persian race of peaches\" are misleading and\r\nshould be discarded. Data from botany and history furnish the chief\r\nproofs that the fruit of this discussion is of Chinese origin.\r\n\r\nBotany and history are a hard team to drive but when the two do travel\r\ntogether in determining the origin of a plant the matter, as a rule,\r\nis settled. Does botany accord with history in placing the original\r\npeach in China? Botanists and explorers from first to last agree\r\nthat the peach is, and long has been, wild in China but there is no\r\nagreement as to the nature of its wildness. Some say it is indigenous\r\nand others that it may be an escape from cultivation. The peach runs\r\nwild so quickly in countries to which it is adapted that it is almost\r\nimpossible to say, from the evidence to be found, whether it is an\r\noriginal or only a naturalized inhabitant of China. But it seems more\r\nnearly to approach a truly feral condition in China than in any other\r\ncountry unless it be America and all know that in the New World it is\r\nan introduced plant.\r\n\r\nOf the botanists and explorers who report finding the peach wild in\r\nChina, Frank N. Meyer[2] of the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nis most explicit. Meyer, in sending seeds of wild peaches from China,\r\naccompanies them with the following remarks:\r\n\r\n\"40001. Wild peaches having larger fruits than the ordinary wild ones,\r\nsaid to come from near Tze Wu, to the south of Sianfu, but some also\r\nprobably collected from trees in gardens which were raised from wild\r\nseeds. When seen wild this peach generally assumes a low bush form of\r\nspreading habit; when planted in gardens and attended to, it grows\r\nup into a small tree, reaching a height of 12 to 20 feet, with a\r\nsmooth trunk of dark mahogany-brown color. The leaves are always much\r\nsmaller and more slender than in cultivated varieties, while their\r\ncolor is much darker green. They seem to be somewhat less subject to\r\nvarious diseases than the cultivated sorts and they are most prolific\r\nbearers, although the fruit is of very little value on account of its\r\nsmallness and lack of flavor. In gardens around Sianfu this wild peach\r\nis utilized as a stock for improved varieties. It is also grown as an\r\nornamental; said to be literally covered in spring with multitudes of\r\nshell-pink flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"40002. Wild peaches, occurring in the foothills of the higher\r\nmountains at Tsing Ling Kang, Shensi, at altitudes from 2000 to 5000\r\nfeet, generally found at the edges of loess cliffs and on rocky slopes.\r\nThere is a great deal of variation to be observed as regards size and\r\nshape of leaves, density of foliage and general habits.\"\r\n\r\n\"40003. Wild peaches found on a mountain side, near Pai dja dien,\r\nShensi, at an elevation of 4000 feet; these small trees and bushes had\r\nborne such a heavy crop that the ground beneath them was covered with a\r\nlayer, a few inches thick, of the small, yellowish, hairy fruits. The\r\nlocal inhabitants didn't consider them worth collecting even, and they\r\nwere rotting and drying up.\"\r\n\r\n\"40004. Wild peaches occurring as tall shrubs in loess cliffs, at the\r\nTibetan frontier, Kagoba, Kansu, at elevations of 6000-8000 feet.\r\nSave for some children who eat these wild peaches, they are otherwise\r\nconsidered worthless wild fruit. Local name _Yeh t'ao_, meaning 'wild\r\npeach,' and _Mao t'ao_, meaning 'hairy peach.'\"\r\n\r\n\"40005. Wild peaches found on stony mountain slopes in a wild, very\r\nsparsely populated country, near Kwa tsa, on Siku River, Kansu. No\r\nfruit trees whatsoever are cultivated by the local settlers in the\r\nmountains, and the way some of these peach bushes grow excludes them\r\nfrom ever having been brought there by any man or even any quadruped;\r\nonly birds might have transported them.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the author,[3] Mr. Meyer says further:\r\n\r\n\"Where did I find the peach wild? Well, I first came across it in loess\r\ncliffs in southern Shensi at an elevation of about 4000 feet above sea.\r\nLater on I found plenty of them in central Shensi, in southern Kansu\r\nand in the Tibetan borderland, up to 7000 feet elevation above sea. All\r\nthe plants I found were freestone types, and according to the natives\r\nthey all have shell-pink flowers. In the mountains of the Chekiang\r\nProvince, however, I found a type which seems to be clingstone.\"\r\n\r\nIn still another letter sent me from the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, Mr. Meyer says:\r\n\r\n\"It is about one month ago since I wrote you last, and so far as real\r\ndistance is concerned, I have not advanced much, but we went over some\r\nvery interesting territory and I was lucky enough to discover the\r\n_real wild peach_, growing in loess ravines some 2-3 days to the East\r\nfrom here, near a village called _Tchao yu_. The plants are of smaller\r\ndimensions than our cultivated strains, and the stones are somewhat\r\ndifferent as regards shape and grooves, but still on the whole there is\r\nlittle difference between a very poor seedling-peach and this wild one.\r\n\r\nThese wild peaches are locally cut for firewood, for the fruits are\r\npretty near inedible, being small and having hard, sourish flesh. They\r\ngrow at the edges of deep loess ravines and on the steep, sloping\r\nbottom of such ravines. The Chinese locally do not call this peach\r\n'_yeh tao_' or '_shan tao_' but '_Mao t'ao_,' meaning 'hairy peach.'\r\nIn the vicinity where they grow, no peaches are cultivated although\r\nhalf a day's journey lower down, one meets with some poor looking trees\r\nin gardens.\r\n\r\nThe elevation I found them was almost exactly 4000 feet above sea.\r\nI gathered some fruits, but they are not quite ripe; I am trying to\r\nripen them off, however, so that we may obtain at least a few ripe\r\nseeds. As a stock, however, it has not the value the _Davidiana_ peach\r\nhas, not being as vigorous and apparently being attacked by the same\r\npests that infest cultivated peaches. This 'find' is of great interest,\r\nhowever, showing that wild peaches exist much nearer the coast than\r\nwe suspected, and that the peach naturally is a native of semi-arid\r\nregions.\"\r\n\r\nThe explorations made by Mr. Meyer cover, of course, but a small part\r\nof the vast empire of China. Further search will, no doubt, show many\r\nother localities in Central and Eastern Asia where the peach grows\r\nnaturally and has probably done so from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nAs all who consult them know, ancient authors are often at fault in\r\nmatters of history in determining the origin of cultivated plants but\r\nthey are usually fairly accurate in stating the date of culture of a\r\nplant in a country. In the case of the peach the date of culture can\r\nbe established as so much earlier in China than elsewhere that history\r\nalone all but proves its previous existence there in the wild state.\r\nIn short, the peach was a cultivated fruit in China before there were\r\nother agricultural communities from which it could come; for, be it\r\nremembered, in China, according to De Candolle, our best authority,\r\nagricultural and horticultural arts flourished long before they had\r\neven begun elsewhere, unless, possibly, Egypt be excepted, and here the\r\npeach, where it may be grown at all, is surely an introduced plant.\r\n\r\nA statement of the first known dates of peach-culture in various\r\ncountries is strong proof that its cultivation began in China.\r\nAccording to De Candolle[4] the culture of the peach was \"spoken\r\nof 2000 years before its introduction into the Greco-Roman world,\r\na thousand years before its introduction into the lands of the\r\nSanskrit-speaking race.\" As we have said, the Bible and other Hebrew\r\nbooks do not mention the peach and there is no Sanskrit name for it.\r\nOf the Greeks, Xenophon, 401 B. C., makes no mention of the peach but\r\nTheophrastus, a little later, 322 B. C., speaks of it as a fruit of\r\nPersia. Coming to the Romans, no mention is made of the peach by Cato,\r\n201 B. C., nor by Varro, 117-27 B. C., but Pliny, A. D. 79, expressly\r\nstates that the peach was imported by the Romans from Persia not long\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle gives no authority for his statement that the peach was\r\nspoken of 2000 years before its introduction into Europe and I cannot\r\nverify it; but a search through even such Chinese literature as is\r\naccessible to one who does not read the Chinese language shows that the\r\npeach was commonly spoken of in the literature of China several hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era. Two examples must suffice, taking\r\nthose that seem most authentic as to the identity of the peach. In the\r\nShi-King, or book of poetry, a collection of ancient Chinese poems made\r\nby Confucius (551-478 B. C.) the peach, in common with the plum, pear,\r\njujube and other fruits, is several times mentioned. According to the\r\ntranslator all of these poems were written before the Sixth Century B.\r\nC., the oldest dating back eighteen centuries. Thus in Book I,[5] Odes\r\nof Chow in the South, is the following bit of verse:\r\n\r\n    In Praise of a Bride\r\n\r\n    \"Graceful and young the peach-tree stands;\r\n    How rich its flowers, all gleaming bright!\r\n    This bride to her new home repairs;\r\n    Chamber and house she'll order right.\r\n\r\n    Graceful and young the peach-tree stands;\r\n    Large crops of fruit it soon will show.\r\n    This bride to her new home repairs;\r\n    Chamber and house her sway shall know.\r\n\r\n    Graceful and young the peach-tree stands;\r\n    Its foliage clustering green and full.\r\n    This bride to her new home repairs;\r\n    Her household will attest her rule.\"\r\n\r\nOther references to the peach may be found in Book IX,[6] The Odes of\r\nWei, and Book XIII,[7] The Odes of Kwei.\r\n\r\nSuperstitions and legends throw light on the antiquity of the objects\r\nwith which they are connected. It is significant that the Chinese\r\nalone ascribe miraculous powers to the peach, their traditions of the\r\nproperties of different forms of this fruit being both numerous and\r\nvery ancient. M. Cibot, a French missionary among the Chinese, in a\r\nseries of cyclopedic volumes on China, devotes a chapter to the peach\r\nin which, after describing the peaches of the country and giving a\r\nfull discussion of methods of culture, he mentions numerous Chinese\r\nsuperstitions concerning this fruit. He writes:[8]\r\n\r\n\"The Chinese have for a long time preserved the history of the first\r\nages either in their books or in their traditions. The oldest of their\r\nbooks have perished. They have saved only a part of their ancient\r\nnational works on the great wars and general uprisings, and the\r\noriginal traditions, changed in a thousand ways, made into fables,\r\nfinally corrupted by idolatry, are today only chaos; but this chaos\r\nis not without any ray of light. Many of these traditions, although\r\ndisfigured, bear back too exactly to the marvelous tales of the lost\r\nbooks to be able to mistake the beliefs of the early ages. Thus, there\r\nare many traditions referring to the peach. Some call it the tree of\r\nlife, others the tree of death. Peaches lengthened to a point, of\r\nlarge size, and colored red on one side, are regarded by the Chinese\r\nas the symbol of a long life. In consequence of these ancient national\r\nsuperstitions, peaches enter into all the ornaments of painting and\r\nsculpture. They are saved for the salute to the new year. Here are\r\nseveral ancient texts on the peach and its fruits:\r\n\r\nFrom Chin-non-King: 'The peach 'Yu' signifies death and eternal life.\r\nIf one has been able to eat it enough times, it saves the body from\r\ncorruption till the end of the world.' From Chin-y-King: 'There is\r\nin the Orient a peach whose almond, eaten, makes eternal life.' From\r\nChou-y-Ki: 'Whoever eats this fruit (the peach 'Yu' from the Koue-liou\r\nMountain) obtains immortal life.'\r\n\r\nStill other texts could be cited but I will merely remark that in all\r\nthe peach is connected with immortality. Again we find that certain\r\npeaches can not be offered by the ancients in sacrifice, and that the\r\npremature blossoming of another peach signifies great calamities. To\r\nquote again: From Sin-lin: 'In the garden of Yang was the peach of\r\ndeath; whoever approached it must die.' From Fong-fou-teng: 'It is said\r\nin the book of Hoang-ti that two brothers found on a mountain a peach\r\ntree under which were a hundred demons to cause death to men.' From\r\nLietchouen, on the subject of the evils which afflict the earth: 'the\r\ntree of Knowledge is the peach.'\"\r\n\r\nVery interesting and illuminating as to the age of the peach in China,\r\nis an account given by Dr. Yamei Kin[9] who was asked by a member of\r\nthe staff of the Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction, United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture, for information concerning the\r\npeach-blossoms. After describing the several kinds of blossoms borne\r\nby Chinese peaches, the writer gives some of the superstitions and\r\nlegends which the Chinese connect with the peach.\r\n\r\n\"The ordinary name for pink is peach flower color, and notwithstanding\r\nthe love of Chinese for color, it is used sparingly, in fact, owing to\r\nits being associated with the peach blossom, seems to have an unsavory\r\nsignificance, as I found when I came home one day with a pink satin\r\nbrocade gown that I had just purchased. My people held up their hands\r\nin horror, and exclaimed it was a mercy that I did not intend to wear\r\nthat here, it would only do for outside countries that did not know\r\nabout peach flowers, which remarks led me to leave it in America when\r\nI came back, though it was a very lovely delicate color and one of my\r\nprettiest gowns.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this prejudice is owing to its symbolism. Just as the\r\nviolet is considered in western lands to be the symbol of modest worth,\r\nso the plum is that of feminine virtue in China and the peach flower\r\nthe opposite. Not even the beauty of its color, whether delicate pink\r\nor deep cerise, redeems it from this fatal significance. In order\r\nthat there may be no possible opportunity for a 'peach flower heart'\r\nto spring up unawares in some girl of respectable family, it is not\r\nconsidered wise to plant a peach of any kind near the bed room windows\r\nof the court yards inhabited by the women, yet peach wands are supposed\r\nto be especially useful to beat off all evil spirits, only they must\r\nbe plucked during a solar eclipse and a hole bored through one end\r\nfor hanging up by, during a lunar eclipse, which perhaps accounts for\r\ntheir fewness, as during those times in the old days the people were\r\ngenerally busily occupied in beating gongs and firing off crackers to\r\ndrive away the heavenly dogs which were supposed to be devouring those\r\nluminaries, and no one had time to think of making peach wands. The\r\nlucky possessor of an efficacious peach wand is supposed to be able to\r\nsleep at night with it under his pillow in full confidence that no evil\r\nspirits can harm him.\r\n\r\nTaoism from early days has taken the peach as its particular fruit,\r\nsignifying longevity, much as the apples of Hesperides were symbolic in\r\nthe Grecian mythology.\r\n\r\nFurthermore peach stones are often made into rosaries which are\r\nconsidered specially fine. There is a collection of tales by one\r\nCornaby to be found in almost every library called 'A String of\r\nPeach Stones.' And a host of legends cluster around the tale of Sun,\r\nthe stone monkey, eating the peaches of immortality stolen from the\r\ngardens of the genii, whereby he attains immortality. This theme is\r\nseen elaborated in many scenes, that decorate pottery, textiles, and\r\ncongratulatory scrolls.\r\n\r\nI wish that I were not tied down so much by tedious detail in the\r\nmedical work, as there is a most interesting book that needs to be\r\ntranslated telling much of the folk lore of the peach interwoven\r\nwith the plot, which is supposed to be the journey of Hsien tsang to\r\nbring back the sacred sutras of Buddha from India. It is said that\r\nthis is an actual historic occurrence, but this tale is evidently\r\nsemi-religious and allegorical, as well, combining in itself the\r\ncharacteristics of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Hans Christian\r\nAndersen, and the Arabian Nights, if you can imagine such a mixture,\r\nyet giving graphic pictures of Chinese life in various phases that are\r\nas true as when the book was written.\r\n\r\nOne of the most charming legends of peach flower lore is that of\r\nthe 'Peach Blossom Fountain,' an allegory written by T'ao Yuan Ming\r\nbetween A. D. 365-427, describing how a fisherman got lost one day and\r\npenetrating up a river finds himself in a creek bordered with many\r\npeach trees full of bloom, at the end of which he comes upon a small\r\nmountain in which is a cave which he traverses and enters on a new\r\ncountry where there is every sign of prosperity, every one is courteous\r\nto each other, kindliness and contentment prevail, but they wear the\r\ngarb of the times of the First Emperor some five centuries previous and\r\nhave been lost to the rest of the country ever since. The fisherman\r\nreturns after a sojourn with them, and tells his fellow villagers of\r\nthis wonderful country and stirs up so much interest that finally\r\nthe governor of the province joins in the search for this wonderful\r\ncountry, but it is all of no avail and at last the fisherman realizes\r\nthat he will never more see the peach blossom days of his youth with\r\nits rosy dreams and ideals that come but once in a lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, a significant fact suggesting the Chinese origin of the peach\r\nis found in the behavior of this fruit in America. The peach is more at\r\nhome in North America than in any other part of the world unless it be\r\nChina. Now, that there is a pomological alliance between eastern Asia\r\nand eastern America is well known. The remarkable relationship between\r\nthe plants of the two regions was first set forth by Asa Gray and\r\nsubsequent writers have added much to what he told us. The explanation\r\nlies, as all agree, in similarities in climate. Now, with this\r\nrelationship of the wild and cultivated floras of eastern America and\r\nChina in mind, the rapid acclimation and acclimatization of the peach\r\nin the United States are readily understood if we accept China as the\r\nhabitat of this fruit. On the other hand, the natural plant-products of\r\nPersia find life anything but easy in eastern America.\r\n\r\nThere is but one further consideration before beginning the history\r\nof the peach as a cultivated fruit. Thomas Andrew Knight and Charles\r\nDarwin contended that the peach is a modified almond. This hypothesis\r\nwould scarcely deserve consideration were it not for the high authority\r\nof the men who espoused it--the judgments of a Knight and a Darwin\r\ncannot be overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAS THE PEACH COME FROM THE ALMOND?\r\n\r\nIn the light of evolution every plant has been preceded by another and\r\nsince the peach and almond have many characters in common, one may have\r\ndescended from the other. But as to which, if either, is the parent\r\nspecies it would seem idle to speculate with the shreddy and patchy\r\nknowledge we now possess of the descent of plants. Yet Thomas Andrew\r\nKnight, the greatest horticultural authority of his time and one of\r\nthe leading experimenters of all time in this field of agriculture,\r\nmaintained that the peach is a modified almond. His theory received the\r\nsupport of several of the leading English horticulturists of the last\r\ncentury and Darwin gave it credence to the extent of collecting data\r\nfor its substantiation.\r\n\r\nKnight believed that the almond and the peach constituted a single\r\nspecies and that by selection under cultivation an almond could\r\nultimately be turned into a peach.[10] He sought proof for his theory\r\nin hybridization and on a tree raised from the seed of an almond\r\nfertilized by peach-pollen produced a fruit with soft and melting flesh\r\nand in all characteristics more like the peach than the almond. This\r\nexperiment, which in the light of our present knowledge of the laws of\r\ninheritance does not in the least illuminate the hypothesis with which\r\nKnight started, carried on in the medieval days of plant-breeding,\r\nconvinced not only Knight in his belief that the peach may be bred from\r\nthe almond but led others, even down to our own time, to accept the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThus, a writer, presumably Lindley, in _The Gardener's Chronicle_[11]\r\nin 1856 says \"we are justified in the conclusion that the Almond\r\nbears about the same relation to the Peach that the Crab bears to the\r\nCultivated Apple.\" Later, in the same article, the descent is pictured\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  \"1. Almond became more fleshy--Bad clingstone.\r\n\r\n  2. Bad clingstone became more fleshy--Good clingstone.\r\n\r\n  3. Good clingstone became more fleshy--Our soft peaches.\r\n\r\n  4. Soft peach sported, receding toward the original fleshy type\r\n     and lost its wool--Nectarine.\"\r\n\r\nAnother high authority in his time, Thomas Rivers,[12] in 1863, held\r\nthat peaches, if left to a state of nature would degenerate into\r\nthick-fleshed almonds and makes the positive statement that he has \"one\r\nor two seedling peaches approaching very nearly to that state.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin,[13] in 1868, considers Knight's supposition at length and while\r\nhe does not positively accept it, yet lends it his support by quoting\r\nseveral authors who put forth proofs in favor of it. His most positive\r\nstatement in discussing the theory referring to facts regarding the\r\norigin of the peach is: \"The supposition, however, that the peach is a\r\nmodified almond which acquired its present character at a comparatively\r\nlate period, would, I presume, account for these facts.\"\r\n\r\nCarrière,[14] one of the most eminent French pomologists of the last\r\ncentury, is the chief French champion of the theory that the peach\r\ncame from the almond and devotes several pages in his estimable work,\r\n_Variétés De Pêchers_, in demonstrating that the one is a form of the\r\nother. His arguments, however, are but amplifications of those of\r\nKnight and Lindley though he cites more intermediate forms than either\r\nof the English writers--so many that they go far toward convincing one\r\nof the correctness of his views. There is the feeling, however, in the\r\ncase of Carrière, in the light of present knowledge, that his botanical\r\nevidence is pushed a little too far for full credulity.\r\n\r\nKnight, Lindley, Rivers, Darwin and Carrière, the men holding the\r\ntheory whose opinions are most worthy consideration, fell into error,\r\nas we think, through attaching too much importance to likenesses in\r\nthe fruits of the peach and almond and because they became confused\r\nin following the behavior of the two fruits under hybridization. As\r\nwe shall show later in discussing the characters of the peach, this\r\nfruit differs from the almond in other characters than those of the\r\nfruit--characters not at all likely to be changed by cultivation\r\nand selection as would all those of the fruits. Knight's proof from\r\nhybridization was purely speculative. The fact that the peach and\r\nalmond may be crossed, giving intermediate forms, nowadays would not be\r\nlooked upon as proof that the two necessarily belong to one species.\r\nHowever, in the light of the knowledge in existence at the beginning\r\nof the last century regarding the crossing of plants, we need not\r\napologize for the inference that Knight drew from his simple experiment.\r\n\r\nStudents of heredity would find almost conclusive proof that the peach\r\nis not a modified almond--a descendant, say, in this geologic period at\r\nleast--in the fact that there is no recorded case of a peach fertilized\r\nby a peach producing an almond, or _vice versa_. If the relationship\r\nwere at all close, if the two species had had a common origin even\r\nthough in rather remote times, if they were nearly enough related\r\nreadily to hybridize or be hybridized, it would be expected that now\r\nand then, as in the case of a nectarine, the peach would produce an\r\nalmond or the almond a peach.\r\n\r\nGeographical botany also opposes Knight's hypothesis, as De\r\nCandolle[15] points out, for, as he plainly shows, the almond had its\r\norigin in western Asia, it being found truly wild in many parts of\r\nsouth-western Asia and having been cultivated many centuries before\r\nthe peach was known in these regions. On the other hand, the almond\r\nwas not known in China before the Christian era whereas the peach had\r\nbeen cultivated there at least 2000 years anterior to the introduction\r\nof the almond. With such widely separated habitats, the two fruits can\r\nhardly be considered as parent and offspring.\r\n\r\nWe cannot close our eyes to the patent relationships of the peach and\r\nthe almond. That the two constitute but one species, as we now consider\r\nspecies, or that they bear the close relationship of the peach and\r\nthe nectarine, probably no one now in high authority will concede.\r\nBut for the weight of the names we have used, and the fact that the\r\ntheory still finds supporters, Knight's hypothesis, the outcropping of\r\na speculative mind in a speculative age, might have been overlooked or\r\ndismissed with a word.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACH IN ASIA\r\n\r\nWe must have more knowledge of the peach in Asia than the bare fact\r\nthat it originated somewhere in the vast empire of China. We want,\r\nfirst, to know what the characters of the prototypal peach were. If we\r\ncan get some idea of the original wild peach of China we shall know\r\nsomething of how this fruit has been improved by man and, perhaps,\r\nsomething of its future potentialities. Second, though not essential\r\nto this study, it will be profitable to peach-growers to inquire\r\nwhether there are types of peaches still remaining in China that might\r\nbe improved under western cultivation. If so, we want them, since our\r\ncultivated peaches are not free from faults, some of which we might\r\nget rid of by the interjection of new blood. It is now about seventy\r\nyears since Robert Fortune, the adventurous English plant-collector,\r\nbegan dipping into the horticultural treasures of China; and recent\r\nexplorations make plain that there are still riches in plants in that\r\ncountry--the fact that they can now be brought through the \"open door,\"\r\ninstead of as spoils to be smuggled out, makes it easier to obtain any\r\nnew types of peaches that may now be found.\r\n\r\nWhat were the characters of the prototypal peach in China? The few\r\nrecords that have come down through the ages do not enable us to form\r\nmuch of a picture of the primitive peach. But plants do not change\r\nquickly in China, for their orchard-cultivation is not as intensive nor\r\nselection as assiduously practiced as in western countries, so that\r\nwe are warranted in assuming that cultivation for forty centuries has\r\nnot greatly changed this fruit. Besides, it is probable that the wild\r\nforms, whether truly wild or reverted escapes from cultivation, now\r\nrepresent closely the original indigenous stocks of the peach. Luckily,\r\nwe have trustworthy sources of information in regard to both the wild\r\nand the cultivated peaches as they now grow in China. We are at this\r\ntime concerned, it should be said, only with the common peach, _Prunus\r\npersica_.\r\n\r\nFortune began botanical explorations in China in 1844, since which\r\ntime one enthusiast after another, thirsting for botanical spoils and\r\nhonors, has brought from eastern Asia and Europe to America, varieties\r\nand species of ornamental and agricultural plants. In the accounts of\r\nthese exploring and collecting expeditions, there are many records of\r\npeaches, wild and cultivated, that are now growing in China and from\r\nthese we may piece out a fair description of the original races of\r\nthis fruit. The United States Department of Agriculture, through its\r\nagricultural explorers, collaborators and correspondents in the Office\r\nof Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction, has given special attention\r\nto agricultural plants and from the accounts of the workers in this\r\ndepartment alone, we can get a good picture of the peach of the\r\nTwentieth Century in China which, as we think, will represent very well\r\nthe original stock from which all peaches have come.\r\n\r\nIt is now almost the unanimous judgment of scientists that the\r\ncharacters of plants are independent entities which are thrown\r\ninto various relationships with each other in individuals and\r\ngroups of individuals as varieties and species. This conception of\r\nunit-characters lies at the foundation of botanical and horticultural\r\ndescriptions and of plant-breeding. It is more important, then, to know\r\nwhat the characters of Chinese peaches were and are than to attempt to\r\ndescribe in full the wild and cultivated peaches of China. In this, a\r\nhorticultural study, it answers our purpose to consider chiefly the\r\ncharacters of the fruits.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-characters that differentiate races and varieties of\r\ncultivated peaches in America are ten, as follows: Downy skin; smooth\r\nskin; white flesh; yellow flesh; red flesh; flesh clinging to the\r\nstone; flesh free from the stone; shape more or less round; shape\r\nroundish but decidedly beaked; shape distinctly flat. Let us see by\r\ndirect quotations from the workers in the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture how many of these ten fruit-characters are named in the\r\nwild and cultivated Chinese peaches of today.\r\n\r\n_Downy skin._--A downy skin is the normal condition of the peach.\r\nThis character is found in all of the peaches to be mentioned in this\r\ndiscussion except those under the next heading.\r\n\r\n_Smooth skin._--\"28963--From Samarkand, Turkestan.\"[16]\r\n\r\n\"A small nectarine of very firm flesh and of subacid flavor; red\r\nthroughout; from a distance resembles a crab apple more than anything\r\nelse.

The _Hung wat to_ seems to\r\nblossom much quicker than the _Paak wat to_.\"\r\n\r\n_Winter peaches._[63]--\"The so-called winter peaches they have here are\r\nall clingstones, somewhat watery and not very fine in general.\"\r\n\r\n\"30340[64]--From Chinese Turkestan is said locally to keep for several\r\nmonths.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cuttings of nectarines from Chinese Turkestan.

It is a late variety, coming into\r\nmarket about the middle of September or October. It is reported to\r\nhave such unusual keeping qualities, that it can be kept, when wrapped\r\nin tissue paper, until February. Though a cling stone it is luscious,\r\nsweet and aromatic, and of unusual size, reaching a pound in weight and\r\nis so prized by the Chinese that as much as 15 cents apiece is paid for\r\nit in the region where it is grown; every year the Feitcheng peaches\r\nare sent as a present to the Imperial court in Pekin.\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence given encourages the belief that in the native peaches of\r\nChina may be found all of the characters that distinguish cultivated\r\npeaches wheresoever grown. The smooth-skinned peach, or nectarine,\r\nfrom the evidence at my command, is not common in eastern China but\r\nin Chinese and Russian Turkestan it is evidently one of the commonest\r\nfruits. Neither does yellow flesh appear to be a common character of\r\npeaches of eastern China but is now and again mentioned so that it may\r\nbe put down as existing in the peaches of the region. Bear in mind\r\nthat the accounts given are but random ones taken by persons not more\r\ninterested in peaches than in other agricultural products and covering,\r\nof course, but a very small part of the vast region under the dominion\r\nof China. There is, no doubt, much to be learned about the peaches of\r\nAsia in future explorations.[67]\r\n\r\nIn America, at least, certain characters of peaches, as flatness,\r\nsmooth skin, red flesh and prolonged beak are looked upon as\r\ncomparatively new in this fruit. At any rate, varieties having these\r\nrelatively rare characters are spoken of as sports and pomologists,\r\nas we shall see, not infrequently announce the date of birth of one\r\nor another of these characters. Now, a careful examination of the\r\nevidence, scant though it is, will carry conviction to all that none of\r\nthe prominent characters of peaches have originated within the period\r\ncovered by history--all exist in China and probably have so existed\r\nsince time beyond record.\r\n\r\nThe size and color of the blossoms are distinguishing characters\r\nof races and varieties of cultivated peaches, less valuable in\r\nclassification than the fruit-characters we have been discussing only\r\nbecause they are less numerous. Peach-blossoms fall into four very\r\ndistinct kinds: Petals large and pink; petals intermediate in size\r\nand pink or red; petals small and red or reddish; and petals large\r\nand white. Through the United States Department of Agriculture, I am\r\nin possession of copies of nine letters from Foreign Seed and Plant\r\nIntroduction correspondents of the United States Department in China\r\nwho had been asked to report on the size and color of peach-blossoms in\r\nthe parts of China in which they lived. The information thus obtained\r\nis most interesting but space forbids considering it further at present\r\nthan to say that it indubitably establishes the fact that peaches with\r\nthe four kinds of blossoms are found in China. This further encourages\r\nthe belief, just set forth, that the essential characters of peaches\r\nare old, of great fixity and originated in China at a time in the past\r\non which it would be idle to conjecture.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that there are peaches in China with at least\r\ntwo characters not found in any American varieties. Two varieties\r\nare mentioned as having \"white stones.\" There is no peach in America\r\nwith stones that could be described as white though several early\r\nwhite-fleshed peaches have light-colored stones. This character is\r\nunimportant and seems, from the brief descriptions of the varieties\r\nhaving such stones, not to be correlated with other especially\r\ndesirable characters, yet such a peach would, at least, add an\r\ninteresting novelty to the flora of this fruit. The other character,\r\nthat of late keeping, appears to have more value. A peach that would\r\n\"keep for several months\" or one ripening in September \"that can\r\nbe kept, when wrapped in tissue paper, until February,\" is highly\r\ndesirable. No doubt through the efforts of the workers in the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture we shall sooner or later be growing\r\nthese peaches in America.\r\n\r\nAs the probable home of the peach, we have given China so much space\r\nin this discussion of the peach in Asia that we can now but briefly\r\nsummarize what is known of this fruit in other Asiatic countries.\r\n\r\n_The peach in Japan._--From _Fruit Culture in Japan_[68] it is patent\r\nthat the peach is one of the leading fruits of the country. In number\r\nof varieties of the several fruits grown in Japan the peach is exceeded\r\nonly by the persimmon--ninety-five peaches and two nectarines being\r\nlisted, all having Japanese names. The following account gives some\r\nidea of the peach-industry as carried on in Japan:\r\n\r\n\"There are a number of varieties of our native peaches and nectarines.\r\nFrom the extreme south of Formosa to Hokkaido, local forms are\r\ncultivated side by side with Western and Chinese varieties, which are\r\nall much superior to ours in all respects. During the past twenty\r\nyears, the growing of introduced peaches has replaced the native one\r\nwith striking rapidity. Their growing seems to be naturally limited in\r\nHokkaido to the south part up to about 43 degrees N. L. The mid-season\r\nand late varieties do not properly ripen there and peach growing\r\nconsequently does not develop to be a profitable industry in Hokkaido.\r\nPeaches are rather easy to cultivate and seem to be less susceptible\r\nto the effects of climate, than apples, provided suitable sites and\r\nsoil be given. Consequently peach orchards are found scattered here\r\nand there all over the country. For the peaches there is no difference\r\nbetween the two longitudinal halves of Japan. At present, large\r\norchards of peaches, regularly planted and trained, are found on the\r\nalluvial lowlands and hillsides. The heavy rainfall during June and\r\nJuly causes an overluxuriance of growth and considerable portion of the\r\nfruits drop down without reaching maturity. To prevent the damage from\r\nthe parasites our people have learned through experience the important\r\noperation of bagging. On the loamy soils, good qualities of fruits may\r\nbe attained, but the growers are accustomed to prefer light sandy soils\r\nto insure success. Sometimes rather dry hillsides give good results.\"\r\n\r\n_The peach in Turkestan and Persia._--We shall become too deeply\r\ninvolved if we attempt to trace the cultivation of peaches in all of\r\nthe countries of Asia. A sentence each suffices for other regions\r\nthan China and Japan, excepting Turkestan, where the peach seems\r\npreeminently at home, and must therefore have more than a word.\r\n\r\nThe peach is commonly grown in Mongolia and Cochin China.[69] Several\r\nkinds of peaches are cultivated in the north of India.[70] The peach\r\nrequires the greatest care to ensure success in the north-east\r\nof India.[71] A correspondent of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture at Kashgar, British India, describes a nectarine grown\r\nthere wanting \"a hot but only a short summer.\"[72] Meyer, Agricultural\r\nExplorer for the United States Department of Agriculture, found a\r\nvariety of peach growing at Kirin, Mongolia, not far from Vladivostock,\r\nwhich he says \"is the most northern locality where I have yet found\r\npeaches.\"[73] These references might be multiplied but enough are given\r\nto show that the peach grows wild or cultivated wherever the climate\r\npermits in central and eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe peach seems to be quite as much at home, as highly prized and as\r\ncommonly grown in Russian Turkestan, northern Persia, Trans-Caucasia\r\nand Asia Minor--the countries of western Asia--as in the eastern part\r\nof the continent. The Chinese early discovered trade routes over the\r\nmountains from the center of Asia to Kashmir, Bokhara and northern\r\nPersia. What more probable than that in remote times the seeds of\r\npeaches should have been carried westward from China and the peach\r\nthus have been introduced into western Asia where it at once found a\r\ncongenial soil and climate. The peach-tree is so easily raised from the\r\npit that its diffusion along routes of travel must have been very rapid.\r\n\r\nOf many accounts of the peaches of this region, long and short, perhaps\r\nthe following from Mr. Albert Regel gives, in the space to be spared,\r\nthe best idea of the extent of the peach-region in western Asia and\r\nthe races represented--races rather than varieties, for of the latter\r\nthere must be legions since we are told the trees are grown from seed.\r\nRegel,[74] a physician by vocation, lived in Turkestan for nine years\r\nand collected fruits and flowers as an avocation. He seems to have\r\npenetrated every nook and corner of Turkestan and adjacent regions. Of\r\npeaches and nectarines he says:\r\n\r\n\"Next to the pomegranate, the Asiatics prize the peach, and the\r\nOriental poetry compares its lusciousness to the fruits of Paradise.\r\nThe culture of the peach reaches its northern limit in the district\r\nof the Ili. The young plants, which, as throughout Asia, are grown\r\nfrom the seed, without grafting, suffer greatly there from frost and\r\nrequire careful covering; nevertheless the large, smooth, red and the\r\nrough, hairy, yellow fruit of the Chinese varieties develop excellent\r\ncharacteristics. According to the observations of the naturalist\r\nWilkins, there are 40 varieties in the Kokan district, among them\r\nsome Chinese ones. In the South the peach extends to Afghanistan\r\nand Tshotral; its proper home, however, is Northern Persia to the\r\nCaucasus. In Darvas the peach forms trees 30 feet high with broad tops.\r\nThe rough-skinned giant peaches of the garden of Kalaichumb are of\r\nunsurpassed lusciousness and aroma, and most inviting bloom (tinting of\r\nthe cheeks). They attain the size of an average apple. The fruitfulness\r\nof this variety is so great that the leaves seem to be concealed by\r\nthe peaches. The Bokhariots prize the smaller rough skinned, and red\r\ncheeked variety at Tchaspak, which is distinguished by strong aroma and\r\nfirm, almost astringent flesh. The yellow peaches are especially sweet.\r\nThe number of rough-skinned kinds at Kalaichumb is considerable.\r\n\r\nThe smooth-skinned nectarines of this region, among which there are\r\nsmaller, pale yellow varieties and very large red cheeked ones, are of\r\nunusually fine flavor and melting flesh; but they are equalled by the\r\nnectarines of Samarkand. There are also small sweet yellow kinds, which\r\nstand half way between the rough coated and smooth coated peaches.\r\nSuch an one grows in the exposed region of Paendish. In Jasqulam, a\r\nsmall rough-skinned, red peach with astringent flesh and musky aroma\r\nflourishes. Roshan, the district of Barpaendsha, and Surshan on the\r\nlower Hund, produce later ripening and less valuable varieties, than\r\nthe territory of the lower Paendish.\"\r\n\r\nAnother quotation shows the intensity of the orcharding in some parts\r\nof this favored land of fruits. In his chapter on the Zarafshan Valley,\r\nSchuyler says:[75]\r\n\r\n\"The gardens constitute the beauty of all this land. The long rows\r\nof poplar and elm trees, the vineyards, the dark foliage of the\r\npomegranate over the walls, transport one at once to the plains of\r\nLombardy or of Southern France. In the early spring the outskirts of\r\nthe city, and indeed the whole valley, are one mass of white and pink,\r\nwith the bloom of almond and peach, of cherry and apple, of apricot and\r\nplum, which perfume the air for miles around. These gardens are the\r\nfavourite dwelling-places in the summer, and well may they be. Nowhere\r\nare fruits more abundant, and of some varieties it can be said that\r\nnowhere are they better. The apricots and nectarines I think it would\r\nbe impossible to surpass anywhere. These ripen in June, and from that\r\ntime until winter fruit and melons are never lacking. Peaches, though\r\nsmaller in size, are better in flavour than the best of England, but\r\nthey are far surpassed by those of Delaware. The big blue plums of\r\nBukhara are celebrated through the whole of Asia. The cherries are\r\nmostly small and sour. The best apples come either from Khiva, or from\r\nSuzak, to the north of Turkestan, but the small white pears of Tashkent\r\nare excellent in their way. The quince, as with us, is cultivated only\r\nfor jams or marmalades, or for flavouring soup.\"\r\n\r\nWest-central Asia, \"the cradle of races,\" is, as well, the cradle of\r\nfruits and vegetables and he who would know more of its orchards,\r\ngardens and vineyards should read Schuyler's _Turkestan_ and Lansdell's\r\n_Russian Central Asia_. We have quoted from the first-named book and\r\nnow close the discussion of peaches in Asia by a few brief quotations\r\nfrom Lansdell, taking a few from many to bring out points worth noting.\r\nWe usually think of flat peaches as belonging to southeastern Asia,\r\nyet Lansdell found them in west-central Asia:[76] \"Here we bought our\r\nfirst ripe grapes and nectarines. Apricots ripen at Kuldja at the\r\nbeginning of July, and we were, therefore, too late for them, but of\r\nlate peaches, that ripen early in August, we came in for the last,\r\nflat in form, about an inch and a half in diameter and half an inch in\r\nthickness. They tasted fairly well, but there was little flesh on the\r\nstone.\"\r\n\r\nNectarines, as we have mentioned before, seem to be especially\r\nplentiful in this region:[77] \"In the market (Vierny) we also bought\r\ngrapes, and, still better, small but luscious nectarines, the latter\r\nfor a halfpenny each, of which, as I sat over my writing at night, I\r\nate so many as to alarm Mr. Sevier, whose medical instincts led him\r\nto fear for the consequences. All went well, however, and I never\r\nstinted myself from that time onward from Central Asian fruit, and I am\r\nthankful to say was not once inconvenienced thereby.\"\r\n\r\nAs throwing light on the wild fruits of this region, we have Lansdell's\r\nstatement that there are whole forests of almond trees and many species\r\nof cherries, plums, apples, pears and apricots, but wild peaches are\r\nnot mentioned.[78]\r\n\r\nOn another page we are told that peaches in Bokhara are of three\r\nvarieties, red, white and green, and in a foot-note that they are grown\r\nas follows:[79] \"When sown, the stone is put in the earth two fingers\r\ndeep, before the frosts set in; water is then let in and allowed to\r\nfreeze; after that, earth is put over it and left till the following\r\nspring, when the young shoots are transplanted at intervals of four\r\npaces. The best peaches are said to come from Samarkand.\"\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to enlarge upon fruit-possibilities in these\r\nwest-Asiatic valleys. Without much strain upon the imagination it is\r\neasy to conjure up visions of great fruit-industries in west Asia\r\nrivaling those of our own Pacific Coast when communications with\r\nEuropean markets are opened and if the people now there or those who\r\nmay migrate there begin to make use of their opportunities and to take\r\nadvantage of the best that art and science now offer horticulture. In\r\nthe event of such a development, peaches, fresh and dried, will not be\r\nthe least of the products of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACH IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nOne finds treasures of experience and inspiration for narrative in the\r\nhistory of the peach in Europe. But to present a systematic record of\r\nthe peach as it traveled from country to country after its introduction\r\ninto ancient Greece would require a volume and a long one, which,\r\ninteresting and profitable as it might be, could hardly be justified in\r\nthis work. Present purposes are best served by attempting only to point\r\nout the landmarks in the history and development of the peach from the\r\ntime it left Asia until it reached America. The first landmark is in\r\nthe introduction of the peach into Greece.\r\n\r\n_The peach in Greece._--As to the approximate date and the manner\r\nin which the peach reached Greece, there is now common accord among\r\nthose who may be considered authorities on the history of fruits.\r\nTheophrastus (332 B. C.) was the first Greek to mention the peach,\r\nspeaking of it as a \"Persian fruit.\" It may be, of course, that the\r\npeach came to Greece from Asia Minor or Persia at an earlier date. One\r\nmight well suspect that if peaches were growing in Persia at the time\r\nof the retreat of the Ten Thousand (401 B. C.), since the army must\r\nhave traversed the country in which, according to some, the peach is\r\nnative and at least had probably then been introduced, the taste of so\r\npleasant a fruit would have inspired some soldier of the retreating\r\nGreeks to carry seeds to his western home. But Xenophon, historian\r\nof the retreat and a writer on agriculture as well as of war, does\r\nnot mention the peach as he almost certainly would have done had it\r\noccupied a prominent place among the agricultural products of his time.\r\n\r\nThere is another story of the introduction of the peach into Greece\r\nthat may be mentioned to separate fact from fable. Some of the old\r\nwriters assert that the peach came to Greece from Persia by the way of\r\nEgypt. Such statements are founded on a traditionary tale first printed\r\nby Pliny to the effect that this fruit was sent into Egypt by the kings\r\nof Persia to poison the Egyptians. Pliny[80] denies that the kings of\r\nPersia had the peach transplanted into Egypt from motives of revenge\r\nbut evidently is under the belief that the peach came from Egypt for he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"As to the peach-tree, it has been only introduced of late years, and\r\nwith considerable difficulty; so much so, that it is perfectly barren\r\nin the Isle of Rhodes, the first resting-place that it found after\r\nleaving Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nWe would like to amplify the bare statement that Alexander brought\r\nthe peach to Greece 332 B. C., but this single fact, if it be a fact,\r\nseems to constitute the recorded history of the peach in Greece before\r\nthe Christian era. Dioscorides, about 64 A. D., was the next Greek to\r\nmention the peach but he discusses it with reference to its medicinal\r\nproperties and does not enlighten us greatly as to its horticultural\r\nstanding. The fact that the several Greek writers whose books have\r\ncome down to us from the period under consideration do not mention the\r\npeach does not argue that this fruit was not then growing in Greece;\r\nfor classicists, then as now, seldom got down to earth and the things\r\ngrowing in it.\r\n\r\n_The peach in Italy._--Naturally one goes to the oldest book in Latin\r\nliterature on agriculture to look for the beginnings of peach-culture\r\nin Italy. This, as every student knows, is _De Re Rustica_, a work on\r\nfarming, gardening and fruit-growing by Cato (235-150 B. C.) on whom\r\nposterity has bestowed the appellation \"Sturdiest Roman of Them All.\"\r\nCato mentions most of our common orchard-fruits, as well as our field\r\ncrops and garden-plants, but the peach is not in his list of fruits;\r\nneither does Varro (117-27 B. C.), the next great Roman writer on\r\nagriculture, seem to have known the peach though he mentions choice\r\nvarieties of cultivated cherries, which at his time had but newly been\r\nintroduced into Rome.\r\n\r\nTo Vergil (71-19 B. C.), we are indebted for the first reference to\r\nthe peach in Roman literature. The \"Prince of Latin Poets,\" writing on\r\nagriculture, orcharding and gardening, in the Georgics, mentions the\r\npeach in these graceful lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Myself will search our planted grounds at home,\r\n    For downy peaches and the glossy plum.\"\r\n\r\nColumella, writing in the next generation after Vergil, about 40 A. D.,\r\nadopts or starts the story of the peach being a poisonous gift sent\r\nfrom Persia to Egypt:\r\n\r\n    \"And apples, which most barbarous Persia sent,\r\n    With native poison arm'd (as fame relates):\r\n    But now they've lost their pow'r to kill, and yield\r\n    Ambrosial juice, and have forgot to hurt;\r\n    And of their country still retain the name.\"\r\n\r\nSome hold, however, that Columella refers not to the peach, \"persica\"\r\nbut to \"persa\" a quite different fruit. But unquestionably, according\r\nto commentators, Columella has the peach in mind in these lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Those of small size to ripen make great haste;\r\n    Such as great Gaul bestows observe due time\r\n    And season, not too early, nor too late.\"\r\n\r\nBy these tokens do we know that the peach was cultivated in Italy some\r\nyears before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nIn Pliny's remarkable compend of the natural history lore that existed\r\nat the beginning of the Christian era, we have the first information\r\nworthy of note on the peach in Italy. His statements, though they\r\nthrow more light on what the peach then was than the writings of any\r\none until his time, taking a more utilitarian turn than those of the\r\nGreeks, are confusing and do not enlighten us greatly either as to\r\nthe history of the peach, or as to its pomological standing. Still,\r\nPliny's observations constitute an important landmark in the history\r\nof this fruit and we must give them full consideration. First, let us\r\ngive attention to Pliny's account of the introduction of the peach into\r\nItaly. He devotes Chapter 13, Book XV, to \"The Peach\" confining his\r\nobservations to historical references but in it so confounds peaches,\r\nplums and other trees that we learn but little as to when, whence or\r\nhow the peach came to the Romans. Since this reference is much quoted,\r\nhowever, despite its indefiniteness, we give it in full.[81]\r\n\r\n\"The name of 'Persica,' or 'Persian apple,' given to this fruit,\r\nfully proves that it is an exotic in both Greece as well as Asia, and\r\nthat it was first introduced from Persis. As to the wild plum, it is\r\na well-known fact that it will grow anywhere; and I am, therefore,\r\nthe more surprised that no mention has been made of it by Cato, more\r\nparticularly as he has pointed out the method of preserving several\r\nof the wild fruits as well. As to the peach-tree, it has been only\r\nintroduced of late years, and with considerable difficulty; so much\r\nso, that it is perfectly barren in the Isle of Rhodes, the first\r\nresting-place that it found after leaving Egypt.\r\n\r\nIt is quite untrue that the peach which grows in Persia is poisonous,\r\nand produces dreadful tortures, or that the kings of that country, from\r\nmotives of revenge, had it transplanted in Egypt, where, through the\r\nnature of the soil, it lost all its evil properties--for we find that\r\nit is of the 'persea' that the more careful writers have stated all\r\nthis, a totally different tree, the fruit of which resembles the red\r\nmyxa, and, indeed, cannot be successfully cultivated anywhere but in\r\nthe East. The learned have also maintained that it was not introduced\r\nfrom Persis into Egypt with the view of inflicting punishment, but say\r\nthat it was planted at Memphis by Perseus; for which reason it was that\r\nAlexander gave orders that the victors should be crowned with it in the\r\ngames which he instituted there in honour of his ancestor; indeed, this\r\ntree has always leaves and fruit upon it, growing immediately upon the\r\nothers. It must be quite evident to every one that all our plums have\r\nbeen introduced since the time of Cato.\"\r\n\r\nOur author's discussion of the kinds of peaches and of their market\r\nvalue is somewhat more satisfactory. In Chapter 11, Book XV, entitled\r\n\"Six Varieties of the Peach,\" Pliny again discusses several fruits but\r\nin the last paragraph confines himself to the peach and puts on record\r\nthe first account of varieties of this fruit. The chapter follows in\r\nfull:[82]\r\n\r\n\"Under the head of apples, we include a variety of fruits, although of\r\nan entirely different nature, such as the Persian apple, for instance,\r\nand the pomegranate, of which, when speaking of the tree, we have\r\nalready enumerated nine varieties. The pomegranate has a seed within,\r\nenclosed in a skin; the peach has a stone inside. Some among the pears,\r\nalso, known as 'libralia,' show, by their name, what a remarkable\r\nweight they attain.\r\n\r\nAmong the peaches the palm must be awarded to the duracinus: the\r\nGallic and the Asiatic peach are distinguished respectively by the\r\nnames of the countries of their origin. They ripen at the end of\r\nautumn, though some of the early kinds are ripe in the summer. It is\r\nonly within the last thirty years that these last have been introduced;\r\noriginally they were sold at the price of a denarius apiece. Those\r\nknown as the 'supernatia' come from the country of the Sabines, but\r\nthe 'popularia' grow everywhere. This is a very harmless fruit, and a\r\nparticular favourite with invalids: some, in fact, have sold before\r\nthis as high as thirty sesterces apiece, a price that has never been\r\nexceeded by any other fruit. This, too, is the more to be wondered at,\r\nas there is none that is a worse keeper: for, when it is once plucked,\r\nthe longest time that it will keep is a couple of days; and so sold it\r\nmust be, fetch what it may.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of Pliny's six varieties is the \"Persian Apple\"--\"_malum\r\npersicum_\" in the original text. It is well to note the author's\r\nstatement that \"Under the head of apples, we include a variety of\r\nfruits.\" A literal translation of the Latin word _malum_ in Pliny\r\nhas brought about many misunderstandings. Beside the peach, pear and\r\npomegranate grouped here as \"apples,\" the apricot, orange, citron and\r\nno doubt other fruits come \"under the head of apples.\" The \"Persian\r\napple,\" then, must be counted as one of Pliny's \"six varieties of\r\npeaches.\" From the name we know whence the Romans had the peach.\r\n\r\nThe second variety is the duracinus, to which, among peaches, \"the\r\npalm must be awarded.\" The name translated literally is \"hard-berry\"\r\nand must refer to the firmness of the flesh. Despite the fact that De\r\nCandolle[83] and others hold that Pliny does not mention the nectarine,\r\n\"duracinus\" can hardly be other than the nectarine--at least the name\r\nfits the nectarine better than it does any peach.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth of Pliny's peaches are the \"Gallic\" and \"Asiatic,\"\r\n\"distinguished respectively by the names of the countries of their\r\norigin.\" Can it be possible that there is a peach native to France? We\r\nshould say at once that this is but one of Pliny's inaccuracies were\r\nit not for the fact that several of the highest French pomological\r\nauthorities state that certain races of the peach are natives of\r\nsouthern France. Duhamel Du Monceau[84] and Leroy[85] are chief\r\nchampions of this belief and the latter says that Mayer, Calvel and\r\nCarrière, other French authorities, are of the same opinion. These\r\nFrench writers offer no substantial proofs and botanists do not agree\r\nwith them; it seems, weighing the evidence at this distance, as if they\r\nhad copied Columella and Pliny too closely. The fact that the peach is\r\na perfectly naturalized denizen of parts of France, of course, gives\r\ncolor to the belief that it is a native and not an exotic in that\r\ncountry. Quite similarly, our early botanists, including so careful\r\nan observer as Bartram, were of the opinion that the peach belonged\r\nto America for the reason that they found it growing wild in our\r\nsouthern woods--an escape from early Spanish settlers. Pliny's Gallic\r\npeach, probably, was a descendant of an early introduction from some\r\noutside source. How the \"Asiatic peach\" of our quotation differs from\r\nthe \"Persian apple\" does not appear except in its origin, it probably\r\nhaving come more or less directly from Asia Minor which in Pliny's time\r\nseems to have been Asia.\r\n\r\nThe last two of Pliny's six varieties are those known as \"supernatia\"\r\nwhich \"come from the country of the Sabines\" and the \"popularia\" which\r\n\"grow everywhere.\" Whether supernatia, meaning \"from above,\" refers to\r\nthe fact that this peach grows in the high and mountainous country of\r\nthe Sabines or to its being a choice variety, cannot be said. Probably,\r\nhowever, it designates choice peaches while the \"popularia\" which grow\r\neverywhere refers to the common run of this fruit.\r\n\r\nPeaches were profitable in Rome in Pliny's time, for they sold \"as high\r\nas thirty sesterces apiece.\" A sesterce is four and one-half cents so\r\nthat the possible price of a peach in Rome 1900 years ago was $1.35.\r\nThe Roman peach-grower was at the mercy of the seasons as are those of\r\nnowadays for we read that when once plucked the peach could be kept but\r\na couple of days, \"so sold it must be, fetch what it may.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement that the peach is a \"particular favorite with invalids,\"\r\nreminds us that the ancients ascribe various medicinal properties\r\nto nearly all plants and Pliny sets forth those of the peach as\r\nfollows:[86]\r\n\r\n\"Peaches, again, are more wholesome than plums; and the same is the\r\ncase with the juice of the fruit, extracted, and taken in either\r\nwine or vinegar. Indeed, what known fruit is there that is more\r\nwholesome as an aliment than this? There is none, in fact, that has a\r\nless powerful smell, or a greater abundance of juice, though it has\r\na tendency to create thirst. The leaves of it, beaten up and applied\r\ntopically, arrest haemorrhage: the kernels, mixed with oil and vinegar,\r\nare used as a liniment for head-ache.\"\r\n\r\nOne other consideration, and we are done with Pliny. In Chapter 13,\r\nquoted on page 28, we are told that the peach \"has been only introduced\r\nof late years.\" This can hardly mean during the day of the author. The\r\npeach had probably been cultivated in ancient Rome for a considerable\r\nlength of time before Pliny wrote. Vergil and Columella had mentioned\r\nit as a planted plant; Pliny, himself, speaks of the \"popularia\" as\r\nbeing grown \"everywhere;\" and the facts that it was a common article\r\nof food and used in medicine argue an earlier date of introduction\r\nthan we might be lead to suppose from Pliny's statement \"introduced\r\nof late years.\" Indeed, knowing the great length of time it takes in\r\nour days of rapid transportation and quick diffusion of knowledge to\r\naccustom ourselves to new food-plants and to persuade agriculturists\r\nto grow them, we should say that the peach must have been grown in\r\nRome at least two or three centuries to have become so well known as\r\nit seems to have been in Pliny's time. The chief point established by\r\nthese quotations is that the peach was well established in Italy at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Pliny there is a boundless, uncharted waste before we\r\nfind another landmark in the history of the peach. In all matters\r\nrelating to agriculture and natural history Roman writers for several\r\ncenturies but copied the men from whom we have quoted and it was not\r\nuntil the Sixteenth Century that we have any substantial account of the\r\nfurther progress of this fruit. During this century, curiously enough,\r\nabout the only books on botany and horticulture were commentaries on\r\nDioscorides, the Greek botanist, who lived and made his reputation in\r\nChrist's time and who for 1600 years thereafter was the sole authority\r\non botany. Of the ten or twelve commentaries, that of Matthiolus is\r\nmost replete with information on the fruits of the times and especially\r\nin the matter of varieties, which he describes in greater detail than\r\nany other man since Pliny. It must be remembered that at this time,\r\nthe closing years of the Middle Ages, there was a great awakening in\r\nagriculture and horticulture in southern and western Europe. As the\r\nsecond descriptive list of peaches we might well quote what Matthiolus\r\nwrote, but, as in Pliny, few of his varieties can be made out, and\r\nGerarde, writing later in English, amplifies the Latin author so well\r\nthat we shall wait for his account.\r\n\r\n_The peach in France._--Peach-culture in France probably began about\r\nas early as in Italy, for both Columella and Pliny, as we have seen,\r\nmention the peaches of Gaul with those of Rome. Introduced thus early,\r\nfinding suitable soil and climate and easily propagated, so delicious\r\na fruit as the peach must at once have become a prime favorite in\r\nthe orchards of the monasteries, where, tended by monks who were the\r\nmost skilled horticulturists of the times, the peach was disseminated\r\nthroughout France with the spread of Christianity. France was the\r\nfoster-mother of the peach in Europe--from her nurseries the Belgians,\r\nDutch, Germans and English had their first peach-trees. The history of\r\nthe peach in France, then, is an important chapter in the history of\r\nthis fruit.\r\n\r\nAndré Leroy, author of the great French work, _Dictionnaire de\r\nPomologie_, gives in considerable detail the history of the peach in\r\nFrance and from him we briefly summarize the material he has brought\r\ntogether in regard to this fruit up to 1600 after which our purposes\r\nare best met by quoting directly from the originals.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leroy[87] only peaches with a downy skin and soft flesh\r\nwhich adhered to the stone came from Asia--all others, in his belief,\r\noriginated in southern France. That any peach came originally from\r\nFrance we do not agree, for reasons given on a foregoing page. Leaving\r\nthe statements of origin in dispute, the first records of peaches in\r\nFrance are to be found in the quotations from Columella and Pliny\r\nwhich we have already discussed. Leroy mentions as the second record a\r\nreference to the peach by Bishop Fortunat of Portiers in 530; a third\r\nfrom the fourteenth Abbot of the monastery of Saint-Denis near Paris in\r\nthe year 784; while the great Charlemagne, who in 800 mentions \"peaches\r\nof different kinds,\" furnishes the fourth of Leroy's early records; the\r\nfifth account is taken from the letters of Lupus, Abbot of Ferrieres,\r\nnear Amiens, who sent several varieties of peaches to a brother with\r\ninstructions as to how to plant the pits, the approximate date being\r\n860.\r\n\r\nAfter these Leroy gives several references to show that the peach\r\nwas commonly cultivated from the Ninth Century on but none of the\r\nwriters whom he quotes gives a recognizable picture of the kinds of\r\npeaches in their day until we come to the epoch-making agricultural\r\nbook of Olivier de Serres, who, in his _Théatre de Agriculture_,\r\npublished in 1604, names and describes twelve kinds of peaches. While\r\nthese descriptions are so incomplete as to be most tantalizing to one\r\ntrying to recognize varieties, yet Olivier de Serres is one of the\r\noutstanding historians of agriculture and his few paragraphs on the\r\npeach constitute a prominent landmark in the history of this fruit\r\nbecause he names a considerable number of sorts and makes it plain\r\nthat the peach is no longer grown as a species but that varieties are\r\nreceiving recognition, though, sorry to say, we cannot be sure from the\r\nfragmentary description whether or not any of his kinds have come down\r\nto our time.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the Seventeenth Century the history of the peach\r\nin France is common property to students of pomology. Botanists and\r\nagriculturists by this time had begun to break away from Dioscorides,\r\nPliny and the other ancients of Greece and Rome; and in France, Germany\r\nand England one herbal after another was beginning to appear in nearly\r\nall of which the peach received attention. Perhaps, since France\r\nplays so important a part in the development of the peach, a brief\r\nrecapitulation from French pomological authorities following Olivier de\r\nSerres, showing the increase in varieties of this fruit and bringing\r\nto mind the men who have written in pomology, may be of interest and\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nLectier, agent of the King at Orleans, in a catalog of an orchard\r\nin his charge, published a list of 27 varieties of peaches in 1628.\r\nThirty-nine years later, 1667, Merlet in his _Abrégé des bons fruits_\r\nnames 38 sorts of this fruit. For the next hundred years the increase\r\nin number seems to have been small, for in 1768 Duhamel du Monceau in\r\n_Traité des arbres fruitiers_, the first great pomological work to be\r\npublished, describes but 43 peaches. This century, however, was one\r\nin which peach-culture increased enormously throughout France. At the\r\nbeginning of the period peaches began to be grown in the shelter of\r\nwalls--a method the results of which greatly increased the culture of\r\nthis fruit. Calvel, in 1805, names 60 varieties; Louis Noisette, 1839,\r\nlists 60 sorts; André Leroy, 1852, names but 41 varieties, but in an\r\nedition of the same work in 1865, describes 148 peaches; lastly, O.\r\nThomas in _Guide pratique_ (1876) publishes a list of 355 peaches.\r\n\r\n_The peach in Belgium, Holland, Germany and Spain._--In the search\r\nfor prominent events in the development of the peach, we are absolved\r\nfrom the task of tracing in detail the history of this fruit in the\r\ncountries named in the heading of this paragraph. These nations have\r\nfurnished no landmarks in the history of the peach. France has\r\nprovided all with their varieties of this fruit. Indeed, in none,\r\nunless perhaps it be Spain, does the peach find a congenial climate\r\nand certainly in none is the crop of any considerable commercial\r\nvalue. Amateurs, too, in all but Spain at least, give their attention\r\nto its orchard-associates rather than to the peach. It is true, as\r\nwe shall see, that the peach first came to America from Spain and a\r\nconsiderable number of our varieties are now grouped in what is called\r\nthe \"Spanish race.\" But horticulture in Spain, from the few accounts to\r\nbe had, is primitive in the extreme--there are no Spanish pomologies\r\nand one cannot conceive that this country has aided appreciably in the\r\ndevelopment of the peach.\r\n\r\nIt is possible--would that we could know the facts--that Spain may have\r\nplayed an important part in introducing peaches into Europe. For the\r\nearliest Spanish gardens were the work of the Moors and since Moorish\r\ngardens, wonderful in beauty of design, show a strong resemblance\r\nto the gardens of Persia, what more probable than that the Moor,\r\nhalf-Asiatic, early brought the peach from Persia to Spain.\r\n\r\n_The peach in England._--The peach and the gooseberry do not thrive\r\nside by side. England grows the gooseberry to highest perfection, fogs,\r\nrains and cloudy weather seemingly ministering to its wants. But the\r\npeach loves sun, heat and clear skies and if these come not naturally\r\nthe peach-tree must be artificially grown. The peach is not, after\r\ncenturies of cultivation, acclimatized in England. But in all times,\r\nand of all people, the English have been most fond of gardens and\r\norchards and so beautiful and delectable a fruit as the peach could not\r\nescape their attention. And so, though under the necessity of growing\r\nthis fruit on walls or under glass, England, since the Middle Ages,\r\nhas done much toward the development of the peach, the difficulties of\r\nculture seeming to stimulate interest. Her pomological literature is\r\nparticularly rich in references to this fruit. We in America, too, are\r\ngreatly indebted to England for many varieties of peaches. The history\r\nof the peach in England, then, should afford much interesting and\r\nprofitable material in this discussion.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no record of the Romans having brought the peach to\r\nEngland, yet there can be little doubt that they did so. The remains\r\nin England of Roman houses, baths, roads, pavements and bridges,\r\nvery similar if not quite so well built as those of Italy, suggest\r\nthat there were Roman gardens about these early houses and villas in\r\nEngland just as there were about those in the great Empire on the\r\nMediterranean. Moreover, there was an early Saxon name for the peach.\r\nThe Latin is \"Persica;\" the early Anglo-Saxon is \"Persoc treou;\" the\r\nEnglish, \"peach.\"[88] But gardening in England for most part went\r\nas it came, with the Romans, and, during nearly a thousand years of\r\nstruggling with barbarians after the fall of the Roman Empire, the\r\npeach, in common with all other garden-plants needing culture, seems\r\nto have disappeared and was not reintroduced until in the Thirteenth\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\nThat the peach came to England, as a permanent asset, from France, is\r\nso certain from the general history of English horticulture, though\r\nthere be no authentic record to substantiate the statement, that we\r\nneed consider no alternative. One looks in vain for a satisfactory date\r\nfor the beginning of peach-culture in England. In France the monastic\r\norders, as we have seen, were the conservators of horticulture, as they\r\nwere of all arts excepting war, and we feel sure that, as the Church\r\nreached England, some good bishop, father or brother planted peaches in\r\na monastery garden. Yet our quest of a date is rewarded with nothing\r\nearlier than 1216, in which year, according to the Chronicle of Roger\r\nof Wendover,[89] \"King John, at Newark, in the midst of his despair and\r\ndisappointment, hastened his end by a surfeit of peaches and ale.\" From\r\nthis we may certainly say that peach-culture was established in England\r\nat least as early as the beginning of the Thirteenth Century.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years elapse before we find another reference to the peach\r\nin England. Lydgate, English monk and poet (1375-1440?), as quoted by\r\nthe Hon. Mrs. Evelyn Cecil,[90] mentioned peaches among \"the fruits\r\nwhich more common be.\" Possibly an earlier reference is found in\r\nChaucer's _Romaunt of the Rose_:\r\n\r\n    \"And many hoomely trees there were\r\n    That peches, coynes, and apples bere.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish fruit-books commonly accredit the introduction of the peach in\r\nEngland to a certain Wolf, gardener to Henry VIII, and fix the date at\r\nabout 1524, but the quotations given show that this fruit was probably\r\nwell established long before the Sixteenth Century. Perhaps it suffices\r\nto say that the peach began to be cultivated in England at the close\r\nof the Middle Ages--a time sufficiently vague to be convenient in the\r\nstate of inexactness of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the Sixteenth Century references to the peach become so numerous\r\nthat one cannot reckon with all of them. Selecting only a few notable\r\nnames of writers on plants, we have Turner, one of the first and\r\nperhaps the greatest of British herbalists, who mentions the peach in\r\nhis _Herball_ of 1551, though rather disparagingly, for he says: \"The\r\npeche is no great tre in England that I could se--the apples are soft\r\nflesshy when they are rype, something hory without.\" Tusser, author of\r\n_Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandrie_, 1573, the best-known work\r\non farming of the times, gives a list of fruits to be transplanted in\r\nJanuary among which are \"Peaches, white and red.\" Lastly, the century\r\nends with John Gerarde's _The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes_,\r\n1597, in which the peach is treated at greater length and to better\r\nadvantage than by any previous English author. An improved edition of\r\nGerarde's herbal was brought out in 1633 by Thomas Johnson who adds\r\nvery materially to the discussion of the peach in the first edition and\r\nfrom this we quote in full all that pertains to varieties:[91]\r\n\r\n\"There are divers sorts of Peaches besides the foure here set forth\r\nby our Author, but the trees do not much differ in shape, but the\r\ndifference chiefly consists in the fruit, whereof I will give you the\r\nnames of the choice ones, and such as are to be had from my friend Mr.\r\nMiller in Old-street, which are these; two sorts of Nutmeg Peaches;\r\nThe Queenes Peach; the Newington Peach; The grand Carnation Peach;\r\nThe Carnation Peach; The blacke Peach; The Melocotone; The White;\r\nThe Romane; The Alberza; The Island Peach; Peach du Troy. These are\r\nall good ones. He hath also of that kinde of Peach which some call\r\n_Nucipersica_ or Nectorins, these following kindes; the Roman red, the\r\nbest of fruits; the bastard Red; the little dainty greene; the Yellow,\r\nthe White; the Russet, which is not so good as the rest. Those that\r\nwould see any fuller discourse of these may have recourse to the late\r\nwork of Mr. John Parkinson, where they may find more varieties, and\r\nmore largely handled, and therefore not necessary for me in this place\r\nto insist upon them.\r\n\r\n1. The Peach tree is a tree of no great bignesse: it sendeth forth\r\ndivers boughes, which be so brittle, as oftentimes they are broken with\r\nthe weight of the fruit or with the winde. The leaves be long, nicked\r\nin the edges, like almost to those of the Walnut tree, and in taste\r\nbitter: the floures be of a light purple colour. The fruit of Peaches\r\nbe round, and have as it were a chinke or cleft on the one side; they\r\nare covered with a soft and thin downe or hairy cotton, being white\r\nwithout, and of a pleasant taste; in the middle whereof is a rough or\r\nrugged stone, wherein is contained a kernell like unto the Almond;\r\nthe meate about the stone is of a white color. The root is tough and\r\nyellowish.\r\n\r\n2. The red Peach tree is likewise a tree of no great bignesse; it also\r\nsendeth forth divers boughes or branches which be very brittle. The\r\nleaves be long, and nicked in the edges like to the precedent. The\r\nfloures be also like unto the former; the fruit or Peaches be round,\r\nand of a red colour on the outside; the meate likewise about the stone\r\nis of a gallant red colour. These kindes of Peaches are very like to\r\nwine in taste, and therefore marvellous pleasant.\r\n\r\n3. _Persica praecocia_, or the d'avant Peach tree is like unto the\r\nformer, but his leaves are greater and larger. The fruit or Peaches be\r\nof a russet colour on the one side, and on the other side next unto the\r\nSun of a red colour, but much greater than the red Peach: the stones\r\nwhereof are like unto the former: the pulpe or meate within is of a\r\ngolden yellow colour, and of a pleasant taste.\r\n\r\n4. _Persica lutea_, or the yellow Peach tree is like unto the former\r\nin leaves and flours, his fruit is of a yellow color on the out side,\r\nand likewise on the in side, harder than the rest: in the middle of the\r\nPeach is a wooddy hard and rough stone full of crests and gutters, in\r\nwhich doth ly a kernel much like to that of the almond, and with such a\r\nlike skin: the substance within is white, and of taste somewhat bitter.\r\nThe fruit hereof is of greatest pleasure, and of best taste of all the\r\nother of his kinde; although there be found at this day divers other\r\nsorts that are of very good taste, not remembered of the ancient, or\r\nset down by the later Writers, whereof to speake particularly would not\r\nbee great to our pretended purpose, considering wee hasten to an end.\r\n\r\n5. There is also kept in some of our choice gardens a kind of Peach\r\nwhich hath a very double and beautifull floure, but it is seldom\r\nsucceeded by any fruit: they call this _Persica flore pleno_, The\r\ndouble blossomed Peach.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first edition Gerarde describes but four peaches, but Johnson,\r\n36 years later, says \"there are divers sorts besides the foure here\r\nset forth by our Author\" and then names thirteen \"choice ones, such as\r\nare to be had from my friend Miller in Old-street,\" who \"hath also\"\r\nsix varieties \"of that kinde of Peach which some call _Nucipersia_\r\nor _Nectorins_.\" Either Gerarde neglects the peach or varieties\r\nincreased greatly in 36 years--probably the former. We have not found\r\nthe nectarine mentioned before Johnson's revision of Gerarde in 1633\r\nand probably this fruit was not well known in England long before,\r\nfor Parkinson, discussing them in 1629, says \"they have been with us\r\nnot many years.\" This brings us to Parkinson's list of peaches, which\r\ncontains, as Johnson says, a \"fuller discourse,\" than Gerarde. John\r\nParkinson (1567-1650), another British herbalist, who also cultivated a\r\nfamous garden in London, devotes a chapter to the peach and another to\r\nthe nectarine. These being short, and every word pertinent, we publish\r\nthem in full:[92]\r\n\r\n\"The great white Peach is white on the outside as the meate is also,\r\nand is a good well rellished fruit.\r\n\r\nThe small white Peach is all one with the greater, but differeth in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe Carnation Peach is of three sorts, two are round, and the third\r\nlong; they are all of a whitish colour, shadowed over with red, and\r\nmore red on the side is next the sunne: the lesser round is the more\r\ncommon, and the later ripe.\r\n\r\nThe grand Carnation Peach is like the former round Peach, but greater,\r\nand is as late ripe, that is, in the beginning of September.\r\n\r\nThe red Peach is an exceeding well rellished fruit.\r\n\r\nThe russet Peach is one of the most ordinary Peaches in the Kingdome,\r\nbeing of a russet colour on the outside, and but of a reasonable\r\nrellish, farre meaner then many other.\r\n\r\nThe Island Peach is a faire Peach, and of a very good rellish.\r\n\r\nThe Newington Peach is a very good Peach, and of an excellent good\r\nrellish, being of a whitish greene colour on the outside, yet halfe\r\nreddish, and is ripe about Bartholmew tide.\r\n\r\nThe yellow Peach is of a deepe yellow colour; there be hereof divers\r\nsorts, some good and some bad.\r\n\r\nThe St. James Peach is the same with the Queenes Peach, here belowe set\r\ndowne, although some would make them differing.\r\n\r\nThe Melocotone Peach is a yellow faire Peach, but differing from the\r\nformer yellow both in forme and taste, in that this hath a small\r\ncrooked end or point for the most part, it is ripe before them, and\r\nbetter rellished then any of them.\r\n\r\nThe Peach _du Troas_ is a long and great whitish yellow Peach, red on\r\nthe outside, early ripe, and is another kinde of Nutmeg Peach.\r\n\r\nThe Queenes Peach is a faire great yellowish browne Peach, shadowed as\r\nit were over with deepe red, and is ripe at Bartholmew tide, of a very\r\npleasant good taste.\r\n\r\nThe Romane Peach is a very good Peach, and well rellished.\r\n\r\nThe Durasme or Spanish Peach is of a darke yellowish red colour on the\r\noutside, and white within.\r\n\r\nThe blacke Peach is a great large Peach, of a very darke browne colour\r\non the outside, it is of a waterish taste, and late ripe.\r\n\r\nThe Alberza Peach is late ripe, and of a reasonable good taste.\r\n\r\nThe Almond Peach, so called, because the kernell of the stone is\r\nsweete, like the Almond, and the fruit also somewhat pointed like the\r\nAlmond in the huske; it is early ripe, and like the Newington Peach,\r\nbut lesser.\r\n\r\nThe Man Peach is of two sorts, the one longer then the other, both of\r\nthem are good Peaches, but the shorter is the better rellished.\r\n\r\nThe Cherry Peach is a small Peach, but well tasted.\r\n\r\nThe Nutmeg Peach is of two sorts, one that will be hard when it is\r\nripe, and eateth not so pleasantly as the other, which will bee soft\r\nand mellow; they are both small Peaches, having very little or no\r\nresemblance at all to a Nutmeg, except in being a little longer than\r\nround, and are early ripe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many other sorts of Peaches there are, whereunto wee can give no\r\nespecial name; and therefore I passe them over in silence.\"\r\n\r\nAgriculture seems to have received a great impetus in England about\r\nthe middle of the Seventeenth Century, possibly with the beginning of\r\nCromwell's Protectorate in 1653. Toward the end of the century the\r\nmomentum began to carry pomology with it, the most apparent results of\r\nthe movement at this distance, as it affects the peach, being a great\r\noutput of new varieties and of fruit-books in which the new offerings\r\nwere described. From this time the progress of peach-culture in England\r\nassumed so great proportions that space does not permit following\r\nit further in this brief account--a task unnecessary, too, for the\r\npomological works of Lawrence, Switzer, Langley, Brookshaw, Miller,\r\nRea, Hitt, Abercrombie and Forsyth, to select the most prominent names,\r\ncover the century well and are still accessible in large libraries.\r\nMoreover, by this time the peach was well established in America and we\r\nmust take up its history there.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACH IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nOne of the first fruits of the heroic age of Spanish discovery in\r\nAmerica was the naturalization in the New World of animals and plants\r\nwhich the discoverers brought with them. Most notable of these are the\r\nwild horses of the western plains and the Indian peaches of southern\r\nforests. Long before the English, Dutch, French or Swedes planted\r\ncolonies in America, peaches, introduced by Spaniards, were common\r\nproperty of the Indians in southeastern and southwestern America. The\r\nSpaniards came to the New World to conquer and brought swords more\r\noften than fruits, but a cheery note in the long dirge of human woes\r\nsuffered by the Aztecs is found in the rapid dissemination of the\r\npeach, among other domesticated plants, at an early period in Mexico.\r\nWhich of the Spanish conquerors brought the peach or when it came does\r\nnot appear but we have record that less than fifty years after Cortez\r\nconquered the country the peach was, apparently, commonly grown in\r\nMexico. The beginnings of peach-culture on this continent are, then, to\r\nbe sought in the region south of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n_The peach in Mexico._--Authority for the statement that the peach was\r\ncultivated in Mexico less than fifty years after the Spanish conquest\r\nis found in a Spanish book published by Molina in 1571, in which three\r\npeaches are described in Hispano-Aztec compound words as follows:\r\n\"_xuchipal durazno_, 'red-colored peach,' _cuztic durazno_, 'yellow\r\npeach,' and _xocotlmelocoton_, 'peach fruit.'\"[93] That the peach is\r\nto be found everywhere in Mexico, cultivated and as an escape from\r\ncultivation, where climate permits is common knowledge to pomologists,\r\nexplorers having from time to time brought to light sorts worthy of\r\nintroduction in our southern states, and frequent mention is made of\r\nthis fruit by visitors to that country.\r\n\r\nThese Mexican peaches become of special interest to American\r\nfruit-growers because they constitute, with the offspring of early\r\nintroductions in Florida, what pomologists call the \"Spanish Race\" of\r\nthis fruit. \"American Race\" is a more fitting name, for these peaches\r\nare an American product. Four centuries of reproduction from seed, in a\r\nclimate and soil different from any previously imposed upon them, and\r\nabnormally short generations have given to this continent a group of\r\npeaches with many characters in common.\r\n\r\nTracing further the history of the peaches that early came to Mexico,\r\nwe find evidence that in a comparatively short time they had been taken\r\nnorthward into New Mexico, Arizona and the Californias. It is barely\r\npossible that from the same source the peach was eventually carried as\r\nfar eastward as the Mississippi, for early explorers found naturalized\r\npeaches in the valley of this great river. No doubt the Jesuit and\r\nFranciscan fathers, chief representatives of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch in the early settlement of Mexico and southwestern America,\r\nearly carried the peach from place to place, for, as advance guards\r\nof civilization, these men usually planted fruits, grains, vegetables\r\nand flowers at the missions they founded. Therefore, it is hardly too\r\nmuch to say that the history of the peach in the southwest follows the\r\nestablishment, one after another, of the old missions, beginning in\r\nAmerica with the settlement of Sante Fe in 1605 and continuing until\r\nSpanish rule passed into that of the United States.\r\n\r\nThat the padres of the early religious orders planted gardens and\r\norchards as they planted the cross of Christianity among the Indian\r\ntribes in the southwest may be seen from such accounts of the mission\r\nas the following, written by a Spanish officer traveling in what is\r\nnow New Mexico in 1799:[94] \"The Moquinos are the most industrious of\r\nthe many Indian nations that inhabit and have been discovered in that\r\nportion of America. They till the earth with great care, and apply to\r\nall their fields the manures proper for each crop. The same cereals and\r\npulse are raised by them, that are everywhere produced by the civilized\r\npopulation in our provinces. They are attentive to their kitchen\r\ngardens, and have all the varieties of fruit-bearing trees it has been\r\nin their power to procure. The peach tree yields abundantly.\"\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of peach-culture among southern Indians, from Mexico\r\nto Florida, is shown by the fact that, among the prominent tribes of\r\nthis region, there is a distinct name for the peach but the names of\r\nother introduced fruits, and of some native ones, are derived from that\r\nof the peach. Thus, according to W. R. Gerard,[95] who gave careful\r\nstudy to Indian names of plants in at least four Indian languages, the\r\nname of the peach is the radical while that of several plums is the\r\nequivalent of \"little peach,\" \"deer's peach\" and \"barren peach\" while\r\nthe cultivated apples and pears were by some Indians called \"big peach.\"\r\n\r\nAs these Indian peaches have cut a prominent figure in furnishing\r\nstocks for American peach-orchards, are the source from which came a\r\nnumber of varieties, and, more than all else, gave inspiration for\r\nplanting permanent orchards of this fruit on American soil, we may well\r\nconsider them at greater length.\r\n\r\n_Indian peaches._--In many parts of the South, from the Ohio to\r\nthe Gulf and from the Atlantic to the Great Plains, the peach\r\nis naturalized and has run into many varieties of a peculiar and\r\nwell-recognized type. This is the \"Indian Peach\" of this vast region,\r\nthe chief distinguishing characters of which are: Trees with long,\r\nspreading limbs; young growth with purplish bark; small, flat,\r\ncomparatively persistent leaves; blossoms large; season sometimes\r\ncovering several weeks; fruit small, streaked with red beneath the\r\nskin, giving it a striped appearance, heavily pubescent; flesh usually\r\nyellow; ripening very late, season long, and of poor or indifferent\r\nquality. The trees of these Indian peaches have a smack of wildness\r\nwhich the best of pruning does not wholly subdue. The aborigines\r\nundoubtedly obtained peaches from Spaniards settling in both Mexico and\r\nFlorida. The first source we have discussed. We come now to the second.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Spaniards planted peaches in their first settlement of\r\nFlorida at Saint Augustine in 1565. We have no record of the fact but\r\nearly Indian traders found the natives of northern Florida and the\r\nneighboring states growing peaches in and about their villages in such\r\nquantity and with such familiarity as to suggest that the several\r\ntribes had long known this fruit. Hilton, an Englishman, who visited\r\nFlorida a hundred years after the Spaniards established themselves at\r\nSaint Augustine, records that: \"the country abounds with grapes, large\r\nfigs and peaches.\"[96] The besetting sins of our early explorers were\r\nhasty generalization and exaggeration, and since the Indian peach, in\r\nwhat is now Florida at any rate, does not \"abound\" we must believe that\r\nHilton was either farther north or was dissembling. Of the abundance\r\nof Indian peaches in the other Gulf States, there can be no doubt, for\r\nJohn Bartram, America's first great botanist, a man of note among all\r\nAmerican naturalists, in the account of his travels through this region\r\nin 1765-1766 frequently mentions the peach as wild or as having been\r\ncultivated by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThus, Bartram says, speaking of the Cherokee town of Sticoe, on or near\r\nthe Savannah River:[97] \"On these towering hills appeared the ruins\r\nof the ancient famous town of Sticoe. Here was a vast Indian mount\r\nor tumulus and great terrace, on which stood the council-house, with\r\nbanks encompassing their circus; here were also old Peach and Plumb\r\norchards; some of the trees appeared yet thriving and fruitful.\" And\r\nagain, discussing the ruins of a French town near Mobile, Alabama,\r\nhe says:[98] \"I ascended the bank of the river, and penetrating the\r\ngroves, came presently to old fields, where I observed ruins of ancient\r\nhabitations, there being abundance of Peach and Fig trees, loaded with\r\nfruit, which affording a very acceptable dessert after the heats and\r\ntoil of the day, and evening drawing on apace, I concluded to take up\r\nmy quarters here for the night.\" And still again, he found on Pearl\r\nIsland:[99] \"Besides the native forest trees and shrubs already noted,\r\nmanured fruit trees arrive in this island to the utmost degree of\r\nperfection, as Pears, Peaches, Figs, Grape Vines, Plumbs, &c.\"\r\n\r\nBartram in his travels found the peach so widely and abundantly\r\nnaturalized that he was inclined to believe America to be its habitat.\r\nAt least Kalm,[100] the Swedish naturalist, who visited Bartram in\r\n1748-1749 reports that Bartram \"looked upon peaches as an original\r\nAmerican fruit, and as growing wild in the greater part of America.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1758 Le Page Du Pratz, who lived on a plantation in Louisiana for\r\nseveral years and wrote a history of the French colony, says that the\r\nnatives had peaches and figs when the French settled in Louisiana in\r\n1698. He probably errs, however, in stating that the natives got their\r\ntrees from the English colony of Carolina since the English did not\r\nsettle in Carolina until 1670. No doubt the Indians had long before had\r\npeaches and figs from the Spaniards of Florida or Mexico. The account\r\nwhich this historian gives of early peach-culture in Louisiana is worth\r\nprinting in full:[101] \"The natives had doubtless got the peach trees\r\nand fig trees from the English colony of Carolina, before the French\r\nestablished themselves in Louisiana. The peaches are of the kind which\r\nwe call alberges; are of the size of the fist, adhere to the stone, and\r\ncontain so much water that they make a kind of wine of it. The figs are\r\neither blue or white; are large and well enough tasted. Our colonists\r\nplant the peach stones about the end of February, and suffer the trees\r\nto grow exposed to all weathers. In the third year they will gather\r\nfrom one tree at least two hundred peaches, and double that number for\r\nsix or seven years more, when the tree dies irrecoverably. As new trees\r\nare so easily produced, the loss of the old ones is not in the least\r\nregretted.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many indirect references to peaches in the Mississippi Valley\r\nmost of which can be traced to Father Hennepin's account of peaches\r\nin Louisiana. He says:[102] \"The peaches there are like those of\r\nEurope and bear very good fruit in such abundance that the savages are\r\noften obliged to prop up the trees with forked sticks.\" It turns out,\r\nhowever, that Father Hennepin was the Baron Munchausen of the early\r\nFrench explorers, it being doubtful whether he was ever farther down\r\nthe Mississippi than the mouth of the Illinois. Probably, therefore,\r\nwe must put much of what early writers say of the great abundance\r\nof peaches in this region to the soaring imagination of this early\r\nreligious explorer. Yet these reports are credited by so careful a man\r\nas Kalm, who writes:[103] \"I have been told by all those who have made\r\njournies to the southern parts of Canada, and to the river Mississippi,\r\nthat the woods there abound with peach-trees, which bear excellent\r\nfruit, and that the Indians of those parts say that those trees have\r\nbeen there since times immemorial.\"\r\n\r\nA little later we have reliable information that the peach was\r\nnaturalized in parts of the Mississippi Valley at least, for Thomas\r\nNuttall, leading botanist of his time and a thoroughly reliable\r\nreporter, traveling in Arkansas in 1819, writes:[104] \"The thermometer\r\ntowards noon rises to seventy degrees and the peach and plum trees,\r\nalmost equally naturalized, have nearly finished blooming.\" And,\r\nagain,[105] \"The peach of Persia is already naturalized throughout the\r\nforests of Arkansa.\" From this we may picture wild peaches as having\r\ngrown for generations in parts of Arkansas and, no doubt, of the now\r\nfamous Ozark region, where, we are told, peach-trees in abundance now\r\ndecorate, with flower and fruit, primeval forests.\r\n\r\nReserving the best description of Indian peaches to the last we now\r\nturn from Arkansas to the Carolinas. Here, in 1700, John Lawson, a\r\nsurveyor, who in his work had ample opportunity to know the country,\r\nwrote about the wild and cultivated plants of the region. Lawson,\r\nalthough not a trained naturalist, was a keen observer, a lover of\r\nnature and much interested in the agricultural development of the\r\nCarolinas. Moreover, he writes so simply, directly, and in a tone so\r\ntemperate, in contrast to the declamatory style of the times, that one\r\naccepts without question what he says. We feel we are justified in\r\nquoting at some length Lawson's description of Indian peaches:[106]\r\n\r\n\"All peaches with us are standing; neither have we any wall fruit in\r\nCarolina, for we have heat enough, and therefore do not require it. We\r\nhave a great many sorts of this fruit, which all thrive to admiration,\r\npeach trees coming to perfection, with us, as easily as the weeds. A\r\npeach falling to the ground brings a peach tree that shall bear in\r\nthree years, or sometimes sooner. Eating peaches in our orchards makes\r\nthem come up so thick from the kernel, that we are forced to take a\r\ngreat deal of care to weed them out, otherwise they make our land a\r\nwilderness of peach trees. They generally bear so full that they break\r\ngreat part of their limbs down. We have likewise very fair nectarines,\r\nespecially the red, that clings to the stone; the other yellow fruit,\r\nthat leaves the stone. Of the last I have a tree that most years brings\r\nme fifteen or twenty bushels. I see no foreign fruit like this, for\r\nthriving in all sorts of land, and bearing its fruit to admiration. I\r\nwant to be satisfied about one sort of this fruit, which the Indians\r\nclaim as their own, and affirm they had it growing amongst them before\r\nany Europeans came to America.\r\n\r\nThe fruit I will describe as exactly as I can. The tree grows very\r\nlarge, most commonly as big as a handsome apple tree; the flowers are\r\nof a reddish, murrey color, the fruit is rather more downy than the\r\nyellow peach, and commonly very large and soft, being very full of\r\njuice. They part freely from the stone, and the stone is much thicker\r\nthan all the other peach stones we have, which seems to me that it is\r\na spontaneous fruit of America; yet in those parts of America that\r\nwe inhabit, I never could hear that any peach trees were ever found\r\ngrowing in the woods; neither have the foreign Indians, that live\r\nremote from the English, any other sort. And those living amongst us\r\nhave a hundred of this sort for one other. They are a hardy fruit,\r\nand are seldom damaged by the north-east blast, as others are. Of\r\nthis sort we make vinegar; wherefore we call them vinegar peaches, and\r\nsometimes Indian peaches.\r\n\r\nThis tree grows to a vast bigness, exceeding most apple trees. They\r\nbear well, though sometimes an early spring comes on in February, and\r\nperhaps when the tree is fully blown, the cloudy, north-east winds,\r\nwhich attend the end of that month, or the beginning of March, destroy\r\nmost of the fruit. The biggest apricot tree I ever saw, as they told\r\nme, was grafted on a peach stock in the ground. I know of no other sort\r\nwith us, than the common. We generally raise this fruit from the stone,\r\nwhich never fails to bring the same fruit. Likewise our peach stones\r\neffect the same, without so much as once missing to produce the same\r\nsort that the stone came from.\"\r\n\r\n_Peaches in the colonies._--The first peaches in the American colonies\r\nmust have been planted at Jamestown for, in 1629, Captain John Smith\r\nwrites of \"peaches in abundance.\"[107] The trees, however, seem to have\r\nbeen neglected for, continuing, Smith says: \"Apples, Peares, Apricocks,\r\nVines, figges, and other fruits some have planted, that prospered\r\nexceedingly; but their diligence about Tobacco left them to be spoiled\r\nby the cattell; yet now they beginne to revive.\" The settlement in\r\nVirginia at that time, so soon after the Indian massacres, was small\r\nand there could have been but few trees so that Smith's \"abundance\"\r\nwas but as a grain of sand on the seashore with the many thousands of\r\nbushels required to make an abundance at the present time.\r\n\r\nDespite the neglect of fruit to attend to tobacco which Smith laments,\r\nthe planting of orchards must have gone on apace, for in 1633 a Dutch\r\nsea-captain named De Vries visiting Virginia describes the Menife\r\nplantation, famous in the colony at that time, as having a garden\r\ncontaining rosemary, sage, marjoram and thyme, the apple, pear and\r\ncherry while the house itself was surrounded by peach-trees.[108] Three\r\nyears later, 1642, Berkeley became governor of the colony and we are\r\ntold that about his house at Green Spring there were fifteen hundred\r\napple, peach, apricot, quince and other fruit-trees.[109] Robert\r\nEvelyn, writing forty years after the settlement of Jamestown says:\r\n\"Peaches better than Apricocks by some doe feed hogs, one man hath ten\r\nthousand trees.\"[110]\r\n\r\nFruit-growing in colonial Virginia was not without promoters and\r\none, a Colonel Norwood, had the persuasive eloquence of the barkers\r\nfor get-rich-quick orchard-planting concerns of our own times.\r\nColonel Norwood, an Englishman, visited Virginia in 1649 and on his\r\nreturn wrote:[111] \"Oranges, Lemons, Pine-aples, Plantanes, Peaches,\r\nApricocks, Peares, Apels, in a word all sort of excellent Fruits\r\nwill grow there in full perfection: you may sleepe whilst they are\r\ngrowing, after their setting or engrafting, there needes no more labour\r\nbut your prayers, that they may prosper, and now and then an eye to\r\nprevent their casualties, wounds or diseases.\" No doubt Norwood is over\r\nenthusiastic in his praises and yet it is true that there were few\r\npests of the peach at this time, most of these coming, one by one, with\r\nthe development of the fruit-industry. About all that any fruit needed\r\nat this time was, to use a modern political phase, \"watchful waiting.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering the agricultural efforts that must have been required\r\nto produce tobacco, then the medium of exchange at home and abroad,\r\nand of corn, which in Virginia was the staff of life, one wonders\r\nthat fruit received the attention indicated by the following account\r\nwritten in 1656 of a still earlier period:[112] \"The Country is full of\r\ngallant Orchards, and the fruit generally more luscious and delightful\r\nthan here, witnesse the Peach and Quince, the latter may be eaten\r\nraw savourily, the former differs as much exceeds ours as the best\r\nrelished apple we have doth the crabb, and of both most excellent and\r\ncomfortable drinks are made.\" Perhaps the explanation of the popularity\r\nof fruits in Virginia is to be found in the statement that from fruits\r\nare made \"most excellent and comfortable drinks.\" On the word of\r\nCaptain John Smith we have it that \"few of the upper-class planters\r\ndrink any water.\"[113] Wine was not made in quantity in the colonies\r\nand liquors distilled from grains were not known so that thirst, in\r\nthis case the mother of invention, caused the colonists to turn to\r\npeaches and apples for strong drink.\r\n\r\nProhibition was not preached in the colonies nor in the states until\r\nlong after the Revolution and King Alcohol dominated every part of the\r\nNew World. Distilling spirituous liquors from rye and corn seems not\r\nto have been practiced, if the art were known, until the beginning\r\nof the Nineteenth Century. The upper classes drank wine, but cider,\r\nperry, peach-vinegar and similar fermented fruit-juices were in common\r\nuse by the middle and lower classes while the carousing population\r\nof the whole country, and there seems to have been many liberal\r\ntipplers, slaked their thirst with rum, apple-jack and peach-brandy.\r\nSo much on drinking, not to point a moral or adorn a tale, but to\r\nbring out the fact that fruit-growing in America had its beginning\r\nand for two hundred years had almost its whole sustenance in the\r\ndemand for strong drink. This is shown in almost every page of the\r\nhorticultural literature of the times and in the laws of the colonies\r\nrestricting prices and levying taxes on liquors made from fruits.\r\nPeaches were grown in quantities wherever they could be made to succeed\r\nin the colonies, not for the fruit itself, but for the making of\r\npeach-vinegar, a sort of cider, and peach-brandy, a distilled liquor.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the first hundred years in America the English seem to\r\nhave brought orcharding to a fine state of perfection in Virginia,\r\nthe peach succeeding then, by all accounts, rather better than now.\r\nBruce[114] gives an admirable summing-up of orchard-conditions at the\r\nend of the period named: \"In the closing years of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, there were few plantations in Virginia which did not possess\r\norchards of apple and peach trees, pear, plum, apricot, and quince.\r\nThe number of trees was often very large. The orchard of Robert Hide\r\nof York contained three hundred peach and three hundred apple trees.\r\nThere were twenty-five hundred apple trees in the orchard of Colonel\r\nFitzhugh. Each species of fruit was represented by many varieties;\r\nthus, of the apple, there were mains, pippins, russentens, costards,\r\nmarigolds, kings, magitens and batchelors; of the pear, bergamy and\r\nwarden. The quince was greater in size, but less aciduated than the\r\nEnglish quince; on the other hand, the apricot and plum were inferior\r\nin quality to the English, not ripening in the same perfection.\r\nCherries grew in notable abundance. So great was the productive\r\ncapacity of the peach that some of the landowners planted orchards of\r\nthe tree for the mere purpose of using the fruit to fatten their hogs;\r\non some plantations, as many as forty bushels are said to have been\r\nknocked down to the swine in the course of a single season.\"\r\n\r\nTreasure after treasure of experience and narrative may be found in\r\ntracing the history of the peach in Virginia but space permits only\r\nthe references that best illuminate the development and culture of\r\nthis fruit in America. Two accounts must serve to give an idea of the\r\npeach in Virginia in the Eighteenth Century. Robert Beverly, in his\r\n_History of Virginia_ gives a good idea of the culture, kinds and uses\r\nof peaches in the early part of the Eighteenth Century:[115] \"Peaches,\r\nnectarines and apricots, as well as plumbs and cherries, grow there\r\nupon standard trees. They commonly bear in three years from the stone,\r\nand thrive so exceedingly, that they seem to have no need of grafting\r\nor inoculating, if any body would be so good a husband; and truly I\r\nnever heard of any that did graft either plum, nectarine, peach or\r\napricot in that country, before the first edition of this book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peaches and nectarines I believe to be spontaneous, somewhere or\r\nother on that continent, for the Indians have, and ever had greater\r\nvariety, and finer sorts of them than the English. The best sort of\r\nthese cling to the stone, and will not come off clear, which they call\r\nplum nectarines, and plum peaches or clint stones. Some of these are\r\ntwelve or thirteen inches in the girt. These sorts of fruits are raised\r\nso easily there, that some good husbands plant great orchards of them,\r\npurposely for their hogs; and others make a drink of them, which they\r\ncall mobby, and either drink it as cider, or distill it off for brandy.\r\nThis makes the best spirit next to grapes.\"\r\n\r\nThe text for the only other account we have space to publish for the\r\nperiod under consideration is found in Washington's diary for February\r\n22, 1760. \"Laid in part, the Worm of a fence around the Peach orchard.\"\r\nThe information in Washington's short statement is inconsequential but\r\nfrom it we form a pleasant picture of peach-growing at Mount Vernon.\r\nWashington owned a distillery and in another place we learn that \"the\r\ndistiller made every fall a good deal of apple, peach and persimmon\r\nbrandy.\" To supply the needs of the plantation in fruit and brandy,\r\nthere must have been a considerable number of trees, all seedlings, but\r\nset in straight rows, for Washington, the surveyor, would have no botch\r\nwork in aligning and spacing. The fence, the worm of which Washington\r\nwas laying on his twenty-eighth birthday, if typical of the times, was\r\nof split walnut-rails, laid zigzag. Eventually it became trellised\r\nwith wild grapes, Virginia creepers, honeysuckles and morning-glories.\r\nThe corners grew up to sassafras, brambles and other plants of the\r\nregion. In spring, we picture then, the pink-petalled trees, in the\r\npeach-orchard at Mount Vernon, making obeisance to the Father of his\r\nCountry as he rode the rounds of the plantation; in summer the shady\r\nshrub-grown corners of the worm-fence, sweet-scented with honeysuckle\r\nor aromatic with sassafras, furnished refreshing resting places as\r\nWashington watched his harvest; later, the orchard, voluptuous with\r\nfruit, gave gustatory promises of products to eat and drink and\r\ndazzled the eye with autumn colors of Virginia creeper, wild grape and\r\nsassafras. The peach-orchard not only served the appetite at Mount\r\nVernon but was one of the most picturesque spots on the plantation.\r\n\r\nLet the foregoing accounts of Smith, Bruce and Beverly suffice to give\r\nstatus to early peach-growing in Virginia. They apply equally well to\r\nMaryland, these neighboring colonies, it will be remembered, being\r\ncalled by one of our authors, \"Leah and Rachel or the Two Fruitful\r\nSisters.\" Of the peach in the states to the south at least a few words\r\nought to be said.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of Indian peaches we have had a good account of the\r\nearly history of the peach in the Carolinas by Lawson. We now show the\r\nstatus of peach-growing in this region at a later period. In an account\r\nof South Carolina and Georgia, said to have been written by General\r\nOglethorpe, printed in London in 1733, we find the following:[116]\r\n\r\n\"Mulberries, both black and white, are natives of this soil, and are\r\nfound in the woods, as are many other sorts of fruit trees of excellent\r\nkinds, and the growth of them is surprisingly swift; for a peach,\r\napricot, or nectarine tree will, from the stone, grow to be a bearing\r\ntree in four or five years' time.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have oranges, lemons, apples and pears, besides the peach and\r\napricot mentioned before. Some of these are so delicious that whoever\r\ntastes them will despise the insipid, watery taste of those we have in\r\nEngland; and yet such is the plenty of them that they are given to the\r\nhogs in great quantities.\"\r\n\r\nA little later, 1740, Mr. Thomas Jones of Savannah wrote to Mr. John\r\nLyde concerning the contents of his town-garden as follows:[117]\r\n\r\n\"As to our fruit, the most common are peaches and nectarines (I believe\r\nthat I had a hundred bushels of the former this year in my little\r\ngarden in town); we have also apples of divers sorts, chincopin nuts,\r\nwalnut, chestnut, hickory, and ground nuts.\"\r\n\r\nThe third writer is Sir John Oldmixon who quotes a Mr. Archdale in\r\nregard to the fruits of Carolina. He writes:[118]\r\n\r\n\"Everything generally grows there that will grow in any part of Europe,\r\nthere being already many sorts of fruits, as apples, pears, apricots,\r\nnectarines, etc. They that once taste of them will despise the watery,\r\nwashy taste of those in England. There's such plenty of them that they\r\nare given to the hogs. In four or five years they come from a stone to\r\nbe bearing trees.\"\r\n\r\nThe same author is worth quoting in regard to the early culture of\r\nthe Melocoton peach in Virginia.[119] \"Here is such plenty of peaches\r\nthat they give them to their hogs; some of them, called malachotoons,\r\nare as big as a lemon and resemble it a little.\" The history of the\r\nword melocoton, by the way, is interesting. It comes from the Latin\r\n_melum cotoneum,_ literally, apple-quince. The corruption is of Spanish\r\norigin and in Spain \"melocoton\" is a common name for the peach. The\r\nword, however, is now common enough in English, no less than 29 variant\r\nspellings being found in the dictionaries and every extensive list of\r\npeaches having a number of varieties with melocoton as a prefix or an\r\naffix to the name.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the northern colonies we find that the history of the\r\npeach in Pennsylvania begins with the history of the State. William\r\nPenn founded Philadelphia in 1682 and a year later, in describing the\r\nnew country, names the peach as one of its assets:[120] \"There are also\r\nvery good peaches, and in great quantities; not an Indian plantation\r\nwithout them, but whether naturally here at first, I know not. However,\r\none may have them by bushels for little; they make a pleasant drink;\r\nand I think not inferior to any peach you have in England, except the\r\ntrue Newington.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find a part of the earth better fitted in soil and\r\nclimate for sure and abounding harvests of peaches than the Chesapeake\r\npeach-belt extending up through Maryland and taking in Delaware, New\r\nJersey and eastern Pennsylvania. We may be sure, then, that if the\r\nIndians were growing peaches in the abundance described by Penn in\r\nwhat is now Philadelphia, peach-orchards were not less common in all\r\nof the Chesapeake belt. That the whole region was bountifully supplied\r\nwith this delicious fruit when settled by whites is further indicated,\r\nhowever, in a letter written by Mahlon Stacy from the \"Falls of the\r\nDelaware,\" New Jersey, in 1680, to his brother Revell in England. He\r\nsays:[121]\r\n\r\n\"I have travelled through most of the places that are settled, and some\r\nthat are not; and in every place I find the country very apt to answer\r\nthe expectation of the diligent. I have seen orchards laden with fruit\r\nto admiration; their very limbs torn to pieces by the weight, and most\r\ndelicious to the taste and lovely to behold. I have seen an apple tree\r\nfrom a pippin kernel yield a barrel of curious cider, and peaches in\r\nsuch plenty that some people took their carts a peach gathering; I\r\ncould not but smile at the conceit of it; they are very delicate fruit,\r\nand hang almost like our onions that are tied on ropes.\"\r\n\r\nWe are told in Watson's Annals of Philadelphia[122] that one of the\r\nremarkable characteristics of Germantown, Pennsylvania, in 1700 was\r\nthat the whole of the main street, one mile in length, \"was fronted\r\nwith blooming peach trees.\"\r\n\r\nAn account of peaches in the Delaware region as late as the middle of\r\nthe Eighteenth Century shows that even then the peach was regarded\r\nas indigenous \"like maize and tobacco.\" This quotation, too, is\r\ninteresting because it gives a glimpse of cultural methods, kinds, uses\r\nand danger from frost. The author was a Swedish clergyman, a resident\r\nof the region for some years. He writes:[123]\r\n\r\n\"Peach trees stand within an enclosure by themselves; grow even in the\r\nstoniest places without culture. The fruit is the most delicious that\r\nthe mouth can taste, and often allowable in fevers. One kind, called\r\nclingstones, are considered the best; in these the stones are not loose\r\nfrom the fruit as in the others. Many have peach orchards chiefly for\r\nthe purpose of feeding their swine, which are not allowed to run at\r\nlarge. They first bloom, in March, the flowers coming out before the\r\nleaves, and are often injured by the frosts; they are ripe toward the\r\nclose of August. This fruit is regarded as indigenous, like maize and\r\ntobacco; for as far as any Indians have been seen in the interior of\r\nthe country these plants are found to extend.\"\r\n\r\nPressed for space, we must conclude the discussion of early\r\npeach-growing in this region by quoting an account of the industry\r\nas it existed in 1750 when the Swedish naturalist, Kalm, visited the\r\ncolonies and spent some time in Pennsylvania and neighboring states.\r\nWriting of orchards he says:[124] \"Every countryman, even a common\r\npeasant, has commonly an orchard near his house in which all sorts of\r\nfruit, such as peaches, apples, pears, cherries, and others, are in\r\nplenty. The peaches were now almost ripe. They are rare in Europe,\r\nparticularly in Sweden, for in that country hardly any people besides\r\nthe rich taste them. But here every countryman had an orchard full of\r\npeach trees, which were covered with such quantities of fruit, that we\r\ncould scarcely walk in the orchard, without treading on those peaches\r\nwhich were fallen off; many of which were always left on the ground,\r\nand only part of them was sold in town, and the rest was consumed by\r\nthe family and strangers; for every one that passed by, was at liberty\r\nto go into the orchard, and to gather as many of them as he wanted.\r\nNay, this fine fruit was frequently given to the swine.\r\n\r\nThis fruit is, however, sometimes kept for winter use, and for this\r\npurpose they are prepared in the following manner. The fruit is cut\r\ninto four parts, the stone thrown away, and the fruit put upon a\r\nthread, on which they are exposed to the sunshine in the open air, till\r\nthey are sufficiently dry. They are then put into a vessel for winter.\r\nBut this manner of drying them is not very good, because the rain of\r\nthis season very easily spoils and putrifies them, whilst they hang in\r\nthe open air. For this reason a different method is followed by others,\r\nwhich is by far the most eligible. The peaches are as before cut into\r\nfour parts, are then either put upon a thread, or laid upon a board,\r\nand so hung up in the air when the sun shines. Being dried in some\r\nmeasure, or having lost their juice by this means, they are put into\r\nan oven, out of which the bread has but just been taken, and are left\r\nin it for a while. But they are soon taken out and brought into the\r\nfresh air; and after that they are again put into the oven, and this is\r\nrepeated several times until they are as dry as they ought to be. For\r\nif they were dried up at once in the oven, they would shrivel up too\r\nmuch, and lose part of their flavour. They are then put up and kept for\r\nthe winter. They are either baked into tarts and pyes, or boiled and\r\nprepared as dried apples and pears are in Sweden. Several people here\r\ndry and preserve their apples in the same manner as their peaches.\r\n\r\nThe peach trees have, as I am told, been first planted here by the\r\nEuropeans. But at present they succeed very well, and require even less\r\ncare than our apple and pear trees.\"\r\n\r\nKalm[125] also gives an account of the colonists' method of making\r\npeach-brandy, which, as we have seen, plays so important a part in\r\nthe peach-industry of the times. Brandy-making, according to Kalm,\r\nwas simplicity itself and it is not to be wondered that in those days\r\nof strong drink peach-brandy was popular. The following is Kalm's\r\ndescription: \"They make brandy from peaches here, after the following\r\nmethod. The fruit is cut asunder, and the stones are taken out. The\r\npieces of fruit are then put into a vessel, where they are left for\r\nthree weeks or a month, till they are quite putrid. They are then put\r\ninto the distilling vessel, and the brandy is made and afterwards\r\ndistilled over again. This brandy is not for people who have a more\r\nrefined taste, but it is only for the common kind of people, such as\r\nworkmen and the like.\"\r\n\r\nKalm, travelling from Trenton to Princeton, found the country thickly\r\nsettled and full of orchards:[126]\r\n\r\n\"During the greater part of the day we had very extensive corn fields\r\non both sides of the road. * * * Near almost every farm was a spacious\r\norchard full of peach and apple trees, and in some of them the fruit\r\nhad fallen from the trees in such quantities as to cover nearly the\r\nwhole surface. Part of it they left to rot, because they could not take\r\nit all in and consume it. Wherever we passed by we were always welcome\r\nto go into the fine orchards and gather our hats and pockets full of\r\nthe choicest fruit, without the possessors so much as looking after it.\"\r\n\r\nThe soil and climate of Long Island and the lower reaches of the\r\nHudson, similar to those of the Chesapeake peach-belt, are so well\r\nadapted to peaches that we may be sure that the early settlers in New\r\nYork eked out their scanty fare with this fruit soon after settlements\r\nwere made. Trade with the colonies to the south, where peaches were\r\ncommon before the Dutch were established on Manhattan Island, began\r\nalmost immediately after the arrival of the Hollanders in America, and\r\nknowledge of the adaptability of peaches to conditions in the New World\r\nwas no doubt quickly acquired from Virginia, if, indeed, the aborigines\r\nwere not cultivating this fruit in the region as Penn found them\r\ndoing on the site of Philadelphia. Yet careful search in the colonial\r\nrecords of New York shows no early accounts of peaches, there being\r\nfew such accounts, by the way, of any agricultural product, no one\r\nhaving undertaken the task of describing the natural and agricultural\r\nresources of this State as was done by several able observers for\r\nVirginia and the New England states.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, however, orchard-planting as a general practice was long\r\ndelayed in New York because of political and economic conditions. The\r\nDutch came to America as traders and not as home-makers, and almost\r\nfrom the day they landed were in trouble with both their savage and\r\ntheir civilized neighbors so that actual or petty warfare prevented\r\nthem from planting orchards until in 1647 when the reins of government\r\nwere taken in hand by Peter Stuyvesant, a farmer as well as a soldier,\r\nwho at once set about encouraging the planting of fields, gardens\r\nand orchards. He brought, we are told, fruits, flowers, farm and\r\ntruck-crops from the neighboring colonies and Holland and these he not\r\nonly planted on Manhattan Island but sent to the settlements up the\r\nHudson. The peach may readily be grown in suitable soils from Albany\r\ndown the river to New York, and, by the end of the Seventeenth Century,\r\nwe are told by travelers, naturalists and missionaries that this fruit\r\nwas in common cultivation by the whites and was even rudely tilled by\r\nthe Indians of the Hudson Valley.\r\n\r\nBut, in eastern New York, away from the coast, the peach did not find\r\nthe climate as congenial as in the colonies to the south and then, too,\r\nfrom the following record, the peach-borer early became troublesome.\r\nKalm says:[127] \"Peach-trees have often been planted here (Albany,\r\nNew York) and never would succeed well. This was attributed to a worm\r\nwhich lives in the ground, and eats through the root, so that the tree\r\ndies. Perhaps the severity of the winter contributes much to it.\" We\r\nhave another reference to show that winter-killing must have been a\r\ndiscouraging factor in peach-culture in this part of New York in early\r\ndays as it is now. Cadwallader Colden, appointed first surveyor-general\r\nof New York in 1719, and in 1761 lieutenant-governor of the Province,\r\na botanist of note, who had a patent of land in what is now Orange\r\nCounty, wrote in 1737 that cold had killed the peach-trees the previous\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe traveler who visits New York today finds many orchards on the\r\nHudson but in them he sees comparatively few peaches. The peach is\r\nmuch more at home two hundred miles west about the Central Lakes and\r\nalong the shores of Lake Ontario. Here, it is interesting to learn,\r\npeaches were grown in considerable quantities long before the region\r\nwas settled by the whites--how long we have no record nor do we know\r\nmuch of the character of the fruit. John Bartram in his _Travels from\r\nPensilvania to Onondago, Oswego and the Lake Ontario_, an account of\r\na journey made in 1743, mentions apples, peaches, plums and grapes\r\ngrowing about the Indian villages passed through on his route. Whether\r\nthese peaches came from the white settlements nearer the Atlantic,\r\nor at a much earlier date from the Indians to the South, or both, we\r\ncannot even surmise.\r\n\r\nSullivan's army, which came to this region in 1779 to chastise the\r\nIndians, found and destroyed considerable numbers of fruit-trees,\r\namong them many peaches. After Sullivan's raid the region was quickly\r\nsettled by whites who, following the examples of the Indians, planted\r\napples and peaches, the orchard soon becoming a prominent asset to\r\nevery farm. Collections of pioneer papers frequently mention the great\r\nadaptability of these lake-regions to peaches. In Conover's _History\r\nof Kanadasaga and Geneva_[128] there are sixteen references to the\r\npeach-orchards about Seneca and Cayuga lakes in and about the year\r\n1800. As in the South, the products seem to have been used chiefly in\r\nmaking peach-brandy.\r\n\r\nDavid Thomas,[129] Aurora, Cayuga County, New York, was the pioneer\r\nhorticulturist, fruit-grower and nurseryman in this part of the State\r\nand soon after coming to New York in 1805, we learn from several\r\nreferences to his orchards and nurseries in his own writings, began\r\nplanting peaches. All of the named varieties from the South and East\r\nwere tried in his orchard and if valuable were propagated and sold from\r\nhis nursery. According to his son, John Jacob Thomas, the pomological\r\nwriter, he had in 1830 \"the most extensive and valuable collection of\r\nbearing trees west of the Hudson.\" Through him the western counties of\r\nthe State were stocked with named peaches and other fruits.\r\n\r\nOf peaches in the New England colonies, we need say but little. Except\r\nin favored parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, this fruit was\r\nlittle grown in these northern colonies. It is not at all probable that\r\nNew England Indians ever planted peaches and for a generation after the\r\nwhites came the struggle for the necessities of life kept them from\r\nindulging in so great a luxury as a peach-orchard. Strong drink was\r\nas commonly used by the Puritans as by the Churchmen in Virginia and\r\npeach-brandy would have been as acceptable but it was easier to produce\r\ncider, and rum from the West Indies could be had with little trouble.\r\nStill, peaches were sparingly grown in the New England colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Company in 1629 sent peach-pits, along with seeds of\r\nother fruits, to be planted by the colonists.[130] Twelve years later\r\nGeorge Fenwick, Saybrook, Connecticut, writes to Governor Winthrop that\r\nhe is \"prettie well storred with chirrie & peach trees.\"[131] Justice\r\nPaul Dudley,[132] who seems to have been the leading horticulturist\r\nin Massachusetts in his time, writes in 1726: \"Our Peaches do rather\r\nexcel those of _England_, and then we have not the Trouble or Expence\r\nof Walls for them; for our Peach Trees are all Standards, and I\r\nhave had in my own Garden seven or eight Hundred fine Peaches of the\r\nRare-ripes, growing at a Time on one Tree.\" From another statement made\r\nby Justice Dudley,[133] we learn that peaches were still being grown\r\nfrom the stone and may assume that budding was not known or so careful\r\na horticulturist as our author would have mentioned it. He says: \"Our\r\nPeach Trees are large and fruitful, and bear commonly in three Years\r\nfrom the Stone. I have one in my Garden of twelve Years Growth, that\r\nmeasures two Foot and an Inch in Girt a Yard from the Ground, which,\r\ntwo Years ago, bore me near a Bushel of fine Peaches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDLINGS GIVE WAY TO BUDDED TREES\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the Eighteenth Century the planting of pits for\r\npermanent trees began to give way to budding. It does not appear\r\nwho began budding peaches on this side of the Atlantic but the\r\ndesirability of budded stock was discussed as early as 1736, for in\r\nthat year we find the English botanist, Peter Collinson, urging his\r\nAmerican colleague, John Bartram, to \"graft Plums and Nectarines on\r\nPeach stocks.\"[134] The matter had evidently been under consideration\r\nbefore for Collinson tells Bartram \"Pray try; I have great opinion of\r\nits succeeding.\"[135] Bartram is hard to convince and ten years later\r\nCollinson is still urging him to bud, for, in a letter of April 26,\r\n1746, he writes, rather impatiently, \"Though thou canst not see, yet I\r\nhave told thee what inoculating a Peach stock may do.\"[136]\r\n\r\nProbably the Princes, pioneer nurserymen in America, in their nursery\r\nat Flushing, Long Island, first began to bud the peach, for in their\r\ncatalog of 1771 they offer 29 sorts though most of these appear to be\r\ntypes rather than varieties. Twenty years later they list 35 varieties\r\nwith the statement that all \"are inoculated.\" John Kenrick,[137]\r\nfather of William Kenrick,[138] the pomological author, who for\r\nyears was Prince's chief competitor, his nurseries being located at\r\nNewton, Massachusetts, began business in 1790 by planting a quantity\r\nof peach-stones the trees from which he did not bud. Four years later,\r\nwe are told, he learned to bud and greatly extended his assortment of\r\nvarieties, making a specialty of budded peach-trees.[139]\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the next century, peaches were nevertheless\r\ncommonly grown from the pits. It is probable that never before nor\r\nsince, the world over, have seedling peaches been raised on so\r\nextended a scale as in America during the half-century following the\r\nRevolutionary war. The country between the Atlantic seaboard and the\r\nMississippi was being rapidly settled and on nearly every farm from the\r\nGreat Lakes to the Gulf, barring a few in the northernmost parts of\r\nthis great area, peaches were planted. They furnished food not only for\r\nthe pioneers but were used in fattening pigs and in the earlier part of\r\nthe period, at any rate, were, with apples, the chief supply of ardent\r\nspirits which every farmer then kept on hand for daily use. There were\r\nmillions of peach-trees in America before 1825 but until that time\r\nthere were but few named varieties. Then the art of budding began to\r\nspread; nurseries sprang up; this vast collection of peaches was\r\npassed through the sieve of selection; local varieties quickly acquired\r\nfame; and, as means of communication developed, the new varieties began\r\nto be disseminated, until, in 1850, American nurseries were selling\r\nover 400 varieties, a number which at the close of the century had\r\nincreased to over 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF THE PEACH IN COLONIAL TIMES\r\n\r\nPeach-growers, in the period under consideration, gave their trees\r\nmuch the same care as is given in the present time except that\r\nthey did not spray. Pests were fewer and yet some were especially\r\ntroublesome, notably the peach-borer, the remedies for which were\r\nas numerous as today. Curculio, then as now, almost prohibited the\r\nculture of nectarines. A rot, the brown-rot, without doubt, did much\r\ndamage. Peach-yellows, as yet, was not the scourge it now is but,\r\nas we shall see, was well in evidence. There were faddists in those\r\ndays as in these. Thomas Coulter of Bedford County, Pennsylvania, was\r\none of the original \"sod-mulchers\"--at least year in and year out he\r\ninveighed against cultivation. He managed to get himself in all of\r\nthe publications of the times for a period of a half-century. We find\r\nhis method discussed in Volume V of the Transactions of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, in the _Domestic Encyclopaedia_[140] in 1803\r\nand, as late as 1821, a full account was published in the _American\r\nFarmer_.[141] We quote the article in full, as it came out in the three\r\npublications named, as a record of the times and because it contains a\r\nnumber of novel ideas some of which may commend themselves to modern\r\norchardists of the sod-mulch school who want a cheap and easy way of\r\ngrowing peaches.\r\n\r\n\"Transplant your peach-trees, as young as possible, where you mean\r\nthem to stand; if, in the kernel, so much the better ... because, in\r\nthat case, there will be no check of growth, which always injures\r\npeach-trees. Plant peach-trees 16 feet apart, both ways, except you\r\nwould wish to take your waggon through the orchard to carry the\r\npeaches away; in that case, give 24 feet distance to every fifth row,\r\none way, after transplanting. You may plough and harrow amongst your\r\npeach-trees, for two years, paying no regard to wounding or tearing\r\nthem, so that you do not take them up by the roots. In the month of\r\nMarch, or April, in the third year after transplanting, _cut them all\r\noff by the ground_; plough and harrow amongst them as before, taking\r\nspecial care not to wound or tear them in the smallest degree, letting\r\nall the sprouts or scions grow that will grow; cut none away, supposing\r\nsix or more should come from the old stump; the young scions will grow\r\nup to bearing trees on account of the roots being strong. Let no kind\r\nof beasts into peach-orchards, _hogs excepted_, for fear of wounding\r\nthe trees; as the least wound will greatly injure the tree, by draining\r\naway that substance which is the life thereof; although the tree may\r\nlive many years, the produce is not so great, neither is the fruit so\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nAfter the old stock is cut away, the third year after transplanting,\r\nthe sprouts or scions will grow up, all round the old stump, from four\r\nto six in number; no more will come to maturity, than the old stump\r\ncan support and nourish; the remainder will die before ever they bear\r\nfruit. These may be cut away, taking care not to wound any part of any\r\nstock, or the bark. The sprouts growing all round the old stump, when\r\nloaded with fruit will bend and rest on the ground in every direction,\r\nwithout injuring any of them, for many years, all of them being rooted\r\nin the ground, as tho' they had been planted. The stocks will remain\r\ntough, and the bark smooth for 2 years and upwards; if any of the\r\nsprouts or trees from the old stump should happen to split off, or die,\r\ncut them away, they will be supplied from the ground, by young trees,\r\nso that you will have trees from the same stump for 100 years, as I\r\nbelieve. I now have trees, 36, 20, 10, 5 and down to one year old, all\r\nfrom the same stump.\r\n\r\nThe young trees coming up, after any of the old trees split off or\r\ndie, and are cut away, will bear fruit the second year; but this fruit\r\nwill not ripen so easily as the fruit on the old trees from the same\r\nstem. Three years after the trees are cut off by the ground, they will\r\nbe sufficiently large and bushy, to shade the ground so as to prevent\r\ngrass of any kind from matting or binding the surface, so as to injure\r\nthe trees; therefore; ploughing is useless, as well as injurious;\r\nuseless, because nothing can be raised in the orchard, by reason the\r\ntrees will shade all the ground, or nearly so; injurious, because\r\neither the roots, stocks or branches will be wounded: neither is it\r\nnecessary ever to manure peach-trees, as manured trees will always\r\nproduce less and worse fruit, than trees that are not manured; although\r\nby manuring your peach-trees, they will grow larger, and look greener\r\nand thicker in the boughs, and cause a thicker shade, yet on them will\r\ngrow very little fruit, and that little will be of a very bad kind\r\ngenerally looking as green as the leaves, even when ripe, and later\r\nthan those that never have been manured.\"\r\n\r\nNone of the varieties that we now grow was then cultivated. Taking the\r\nsorts described in 1800 we find that four were red-fleshed; eight,\r\nyellow-fleshed; thirty-four, white-fleshed; eighteen, freestones;\r\nnineteen, clingstones, and twelve nectarines. There were no flat, or\r\nPeento, peaches but a sort known as Venus's Nipple was seemingly a\r\ntypical beaked peach.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, Baltimore was the best market for peaches in America and\r\nwas near the Chesapeake peach-belt. We are fortunate in having a\r\ndescription of peach-growing around Baltimore at about that time.\r\nRichard Parkinson, an English farmer and agricultural writer, came to\r\nAmerica to rent one of George Washington's farms in 1798. The two could\r\nnot agree and Parkinson rented a farm near Baltimore on which was a\r\npeach-orchard. He published an account of his experiences in two very\r\nreadable volumes and from this work we quote in part the story of his\r\npeach-orchard. Perhaps allowances should be made, for Parkinson seems\r\nto have been soured by failure and some of his expressions are such\r\nas might be expected from an opinionated Englishman undergoing new\r\nexperiences in America just after the Revolution. Parkinson says:[142]\r\n\r\n\"It would astonish a stranger to see the quantity of fruit in these\r\nparts, which makes the country to look beautiful twice a-year, when the\r\ntrees are in blossom, and when the fruit is on the trees ripe. But the\r\nfruit is chiefly for the use of hogs and can be applied to no better\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nOn my farm at Orange-Hill, only three miles from Baltimore, the last\r\nyear I was there, I sold all my peaches to two men at four pence per\r\npeck, and let them have a cart and a horse to take them into the city\r\nto sell, knowing I had only made four pence per peck on the average\r\nthe year before, and gathered them myself. These men agreed to pick\r\nthem, and feed the horse in town at their expence. It was the opinion\r\nof every one that they had got a great bargain, and many others wished\r\nthey had had it. They picked about one-half of them, and carried\r\nthem to Baltimore: but, alas! they gave up the business, saying they\r\ncould not make wages, although they at first had said that they would\r\ncertainly take every peach, intending, if the market should not suit,\r\nto carry them to the stills, &c. I was in hopes all this exertion would\r\nmake this bargain successful, as four pence per peck would pay much\r\nbetter than to give them to hogs, as I have no knowledge of what number\r\na hog will eat. Seeing this scheme frustrated, and thinking it a sin\r\nand a shame to see such a number of fine peaches rot on the ground, I\r\nmounted my horse and rode to the stills, as there were many small ones\r\nwithin three or four miles of me in the country. They have been erected\r\nfor this use; but many of them are never used after the first year;\r\nand I am of the opinion that they will not pay expences. The men at\r\nthe stills were civil enough; they offered to lend me the still, and\r\nlet me find a man to work it, &c. or they would work it for me; but,\r\nfrom every information I could obtain, I found that my peaches would\r\nnot more than pay the carriage to the stills and hardly that; and after\r\nselling them to the owners of the stills, they would not give me so\r\nmuch for my fruit, as would pay me for my trouble; nor will peaches pay\r\nthe farmer, to be given to the hogs, if they be not so situated that\r\nthe hogs can run where they are; and that happened not to be my case.\r\n\r\nAs a striking instance of the little profit of stills, Mr. O'Donnel,\r\nat Canton, had planted an orchard, of great extent, of red peaches,\r\nfor the purpose of making peach-brandy. The red peach is reckoned much\r\nsuperior to any other for brandy. Although Mr. O'Donnel's orchard had\r\ngrown to bear in great perfection and he had a still and the other\r\nnecessary apparatus, the profit proved so small, that he suffered\r\nthe whole to go waste, and his pigs consumed the produce; and, in\r\nthe winter, rooted up all those fine peach trees, and planted the\r\nground with Indian corn, having previously manured the land with dung\r\nfrom Baltimore for the purpose of an orchard. Now this gentleman had\r\nsome hundreds of acres of woodlands unimproved in this plantation;\r\ntherefore, the cause could not be for want of land.\r\n\r\nMy fine turnips, Indian corn, potatoes, &c. were in the field by the\r\norchard without any fence. Indeed hogs are not allowed to run at large\r\nwithin five miles of Baltimore, by an act of assembly; and mine were\r\ntoo valuable to risk such a misfortune; and especially as I was a great\r\nhog-shooter myself, it would have been fine diversion for any of my\r\nneighbours to have shot one of my fifty-dollar pigs. Seeing that these\r\nplants would not succeed, all that remained was to fatten my own hogs\r\nwith them. I had but seven hogs; and they would have employed a man\r\nwith horse and cart half a day to feed them; for, after a short time,\r\nthey will only eat the best peaches, and refuse the others as a man\r\nwould. I found this plan would not answer; and the consequence was,\r\nthat, after every trial and exertion, they rotted on the ground. Now\r\nmy farm was so situated that the great road through the heart of the\r\ncountry went through it, five or six stage-coaches, and great numbers\r\nof other carriages of all kinds. In all probability some of my own\r\ncountrymen as merchants (for there begin to be many of these gentlemen\r\nto settle their accounts with the American merchants, and I suppose\r\nthey will increase) seeing this waste committed, would, on returning\r\nto England, relate their story in this way--That when at the tavern\r\nat Baltimore on the same day, the fruit-people were asking eleven\r\npence apiece for peaches. An Englishman says to himself, 'What idle\r\nfools those Americans are! and I think all the English, when they get\r\nto America, are as bad: but, when I get there, I will set them the\r\nexample.' But when there, he finds himself much disappointed, and does\r\nnot know how it is that he does not increase in riches, while neither\r\nhimself nor his family enjoys any comfort. He at last finds out that\r\nthe Americans are not a set of fools as he once thought: and, as he\r\nmust have a name for them, perhaps he calls them rogues; which, if Lord\r\nChesterfield was right in his observation, pleases a man the best of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nWhen I took this farm, I had not a doubt, that, by some extraordinary\r\nexertion, I should be able to make something handsome from peaches,\r\nand so near Baltimore. Before I took the farm, when I enquired how\r\npeaches sold in the market, perhaps they would tell me eleven pence\r\napiece, and eleven pence a peck on the same day. That used to stagger\r\nme very much: but it is so: and the man who offers you a fine Newington\r\npeach for eleven pence or a five-penny bit, sells but few each day; and\r\nlives, although very poorly, at a very great expence; consequently his\r\nprofit must be great on each article. The man who sells the peaches at\r\neleven pence each, will not grow rich by his business, any more than\r\nthe grower. Then we come to the calculation of my profit at four pence\r\nper peck, which is the best and greatest price. Could the scheme be\r\nput in execution, it will, generally speaking, require two men and one\r\nhorse and cart each day, to pick thirty pecks and carry them to market;\r\nand thirty pecks are more than any white man can sell one day with\r\nanother. A black man is much better for this business than a white man;\r\nalthough they are in general ignorant, they are impudent: thirty pecks\r\nof peaches, at four pence per peck, is just ten shillings per day for\r\npeaches; and the two men's wages are worth, at that season of the year,\r\none dollar per day each, and one pint of whiskey, which will be sixteen\r\nshillings for the men: the cart and horse are worth one dollar and a\r\nhalf per day; but you could not hire it for less than two dollars.\r\nNow the expences on this business are one pound seven shillings and\r\nthree pence per day, and the produce is ten shillings. But as I sold\r\nthem, I made profit each day on thirty pecks of peaches two shillings\r\nand nine pence: the reader may plainly see that there could not be\r\nany thing done better. This shews in this part of the work where I am\r\non the Eastern Shore, one hundred miles and upwards from market, that\r\nthe reader will be convinced the cherries and peaches pay the best for\r\nhogs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nADAPTABILITY AND VARIABILITY IN THE PEACH\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages our narrative has flitted from continent to\r\ncontinent and country to country in a belt encircling the earth. Few\r\nother fruits are found under such varied conditions and over such\r\nextended areas. We have seen that peaches are found wild and cultivated\r\nover much of Japan; as far north as Vladivostock in Korea; once a\r\nwild inhabitant of some part of China it is now cultivated in nearly\r\nevery section of that vast empire where agriculture is an industry;\r\nthe trees are so abundant and so much at home in the orchards and\r\nforests of the Turkestans and Persia as to have given rise to the\r\nbelief that they have always grown there. While not so common as in\r\nAsia, yet peaches thrive in all of southern Europe and readily submit\r\nto artificial culture in pots and on walls in northern European\r\nlatitudes. Coming to America with the first Spaniards, the peach found\r\nsuch congenial surroundings that it spread rapidly, freely and widely,\r\nleading botanists three centuries later to call it a native. In the\r\nfruit-areas of the United States, after two centuries of cultivation,\r\nthough sometimes a luxury and the crop often a speculation, the peach\r\nis so perennially plentiful that it is to be found, fresh, canned or\r\nevaporated, in every home in the land and the species is represented in\r\nAmerican pomologies by over 1000 sorts which have originated in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHowever, in tracing the history of the peach from China to America,\r\nwe have not wholly shown the range of adaptability of this fruit.\r\nThe peach has become adapted to the clear skies, strong light, long\r\nseasons and hot climate of northern Africa, where, under modified\r\ncultural treatment, it is a common fruit in Egypt[143] and the other\r\nstates bordering on the Mediterranean. It thrives on the islands in the\r\nMediterranean and on those of the North Temperate zone almost to the\r\ntropics in the Atlantic and the Pacific, as the Azores, Canaries, West\r\nIndies and Hawaiian group. As long ago as 1649 the Azores were famous\r\nfor peaches and Colonel Norwood, author of _A Voyage to Virginia_,[144]\r\nin a gustatory reminiscence tells us that they were of so good quality\r\nthat he \"did not fail to visit and revisit them in the dead of night to\r\nsatisfy a ravenous appetite nature has too prodigally given me for that\r\nspecies.\" In the sub-tropic climate of Guadeloupe Islands, French West\r\nIndies, there is a peach peculiar to the region differing in shape,\r\nflavor and in heat-resisting qualities from the common run of this\r\nfruit.[145]\r\n\r\nThe Aryan race has taken the peach across the equator in the pathways\r\nof discovery, conquest and civilization, and made it a favorite fruit\r\nin the gardens and orchards of the South Temperate as well as in\r\nthose of the North Temperate zone. In the colonies of South Africa\r\nthe peach seems to be as common as any deciduous fruit, native sorts\r\nbeing planted with those from Europe and America. Of the Transvaal\r\nYellow Peach, R. A. Davis, horticulturist of the colony, says:[146]\r\n\"Generally speaking, it is the fruit most commonly grown in the\r\nTransvaal, and it may safely be said that where it will not grow no\r\nother peach stands much chance of thriving. The writer has seen them\r\nflourishing by the side of the railroad amongst granite boulders, the\r\nresult of a chance pit thrown from the window of a railway carriage. It\r\nis also extensively grown as a hedge around homesteads, having been\r\nplanted after the primitive method of turning a furrow where the hedge\r\nwas wanted and simply dropping the seeds in after the plough. It is\r\ncommonly recognised that the peach hedge should duly appear and bear\r\nfruit in two years from planting the seed. The writer has also seen\r\nthem growing by the side of water-furrows and dams, with the whole of\r\nthe roots on one side of the tree at least immersed in water.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, no doubt, planted the peach in parts of South America\r\nsoon after the discovery of the continent and it now runs wild on\r\nboth coasts. Thus, Darwin in his famous voyage found the islands at\r\nthe mouth of the Parana River, Argentina, \"thickly clothed with peach\r\nand orange trees carried there by the waters of the river.\"[147] Many\r\nreferences to wild peaches on the Pacific Coast may be found, as\r\ninteresting as any being one from Bertero who says that on Robinson\r\nCrusoe's island, Juan Fernandez,[148] \"The peach is so abundant\r\nthat one can scarcely form an idea of the quantity of fruit that\r\nit bears. They are in general of good quality despite the state of\r\nwildness.\" According to Oakenfull,[149] in Brazil, \"Of all the fruits\r\nintroduced from abroad, the peach has made itself more at home than\r\nany.\" Wight[150] reports the peach and nectarine in Argentina, Chile,\r\nPeru and Bolivia under cultivation and as escapes from cultivation\r\nin seemingly all degrees of evolution. The peach-drying industry is\r\nimportant in the province of Coquimbo, Chile. According to Lounsbury\r\nthe peach is the most common fruit-tree in Argentina. He says:[151]\r\n\"It grows almost everywhere most luxuriantly, bears heavily and as yet\r\nno very serious insect or fungus pest for it has become widespread.\r\nSolid blocks of thousands of trees are not uncommon about Buenos\r\nAyres. Most of the choice varieties of Europe and America have been\r\nintroduced.\" The culture of this fruit in South America falls short\r\nof that in North America only because of the lack of advancement in\r\nhorticulture--the one continent is a century behind the other in this\r\nfield of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn temperate Oceanica the peach plays as important a part in\r\nhorticulture as any other of the deciduous tree-fruits. In early days\r\nin New Zealand, \"vast groves of peaches existed, sometimes, as in the\r\nWaikato, extending for miles, where magnificently grown trees cropped\r\nwithout limit.\"[152] Both the peach and nectarine are grown in the\r\nhorticultural regions of the island. Wherever the fruits of temperate\r\nclimates are cultivated in Australia, there may the peach be found. If\r\none may judge from the attention given this fruit in the agricultural\r\nliterature of New Zealand and Australia, it holds the same high place\r\nin the horticulture of these islands in the Pacific that it has in\r\nEurope and America.\r\n\r\nThe types of peaches are almost as diverse as the regions in which the\r\nfruit is an inhabitant. The 2181 varieties described in _The Peaches of\r\nNew York_ attest the variability of the species in America and Europe,\r\nmany of our sorts having come from the Old World. This great number of\r\nkinds can be distinguished by reason of differences in skin, flesh,\r\nflavor, aroma, stone and season, the attributes of which have been\r\nmentioned several times in foregoing paragraphs. The structure of leaf\r\nand tree offers as many more taxonomic characters. It is interesting to\r\nnote the extreme forms in fruit and tree the peach has taken on in its\r\ncenturies of world-wide wanderings.\r\n\r\nRound, flat, beaked, free or clingstone peaches with smooth or downy\r\nskins and red, yellow or white flesh, sweet, sour or bitter, in all\r\ncombinations, and each often modified by soil and climate, are known\r\nto American growers of this fruit. But there are many peaches with\r\nless well-known characters. Thus, a peach in China bears fruits as\r\nheavy as one pound apiece with extraordinary keeping and shipping\r\nqualities;[153] another Chinese peach of the Honey type has a tree\r\nwith a maximum height of only seven or eight feet;[154] growing in\r\nthe same locality, Poliping, China, is a variety with extraordinarily\r\nlong leaves;[155] the _Paak wat to_ peach from China is a white-stoned\r\nsort;[156] a variety in the French West Indies has fruits that peel\r\neasily and withstand a continuous temperature in ripening season of\r\n76 to 90 degrees;[157] from Kashgar comes a peach that will keep for\r\nseveral months;[158] in Chinese Turkestan there is a nectarine \"said\r\nto keep for several weeks after fully ripe;\"[159] even more remarkable\r\nis the Feitcheng peach which ripens in late September and can be kept,\r\nif wrapped in paper, until February;[160] as remarkable as any is the\r\nTransvaal Yellow of South Africa which we have seen in a foregoing\r\nparagraph grows \"amongst granite boulders,\" \"as a hedge around\r\nhomesteads\" and \"beside water furrows and dams, the roots of one side\r\nof the tree immersed in water;\" the Fragrant Peach and the Firm Peach\r\nfrom China are not yet known in America;[161] another Chinese peach is\r\na dwarf, \"grown in pots indoors, which fruits at a height of fifteen\r\ninches and bears peaches on the main trunk though the stem be scarcely\r\nlarger than a lead pencil.\"[162] Most of the examples named are from\r\nChina but others can be found in every distinct region in which peaches\r\nhave long been grown.\r\n\r\nEvery well-marked geographical region in which the peach is grown\r\ncomes, sooner or later, to have a type of varieties of its own; yet\r\nthe universal stamp of the peach--of cultivated _Prunus persica_--is\r\non them all. These facts imply two important things. First, the peach\r\nis an exceedingly flexible fruit, capable of being moulded to fit many\r\nconditions of environment; and, under cultivation, training, feeding\r\nand culture in unlike regions, soils and climates, may still be greatly\r\nimproved and the improvements all intensified and augmented by crossing\r\nand selecting. Second, the peach, a gift to the world from China, has\r\nseemingly, in its centuries of cultivation by the Orientals, taken on\r\nsufficient immutability to make it one of the most stable of species,\r\nespecially in its fruits. The many races and thousands of varieties\r\nare all best put in one species; many varieties come true to seed;\r\nand peaches from seed seldom \"revert\" to worthless forms as so many\r\nseedling fruits habitually do. Cultivated plants, as all who work with\r\nthem know, differ widely in variability. Some, as corn, the cucurbits,\r\nand grapes and plums with their many species, are so variable as to\r\nbe almost unmanageable in attempts to improve them; others, as the\r\ncereals, are quite too immutable for the best work of the breeder.\r\nThe peach is neither a stone wall nor shifting sand in the matter of\r\nvariability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBOTANICAL AND HORTICULTURAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE PEACH\r\n\r\nPLACE OF THE PEACH IN THE GENUS PRUNUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genus Prunus is without peer in the number of distinct,\r\nnatural, esculent products it furnishes man. Here belong the\r\nstone-fruits--peaches, plums, cherries, almonds and apricots,\r\nrepresented by some forty edible species, which, through long\r\ndomestication, have been broken up into not less than 5000\r\norchard-varieties, of which at least 3000 are now under cultivation.\r\nOf the two-score cultivated species of this genus, _Prunus persica_,\r\nthe common peach, is easily the most remarkable when judged either by\r\nthe senses which make foods palatable and pleasant or by the criteria\r\nthat establish the commercial worth of a product. As virtues which\r\ngive the peach leading place among stone-fruits, we may specify: Wider\r\ndistribution and consequently commoner cultivation and a greater\r\nnumber of varieties; larger size, greater beauty, pleasanter and more\r\ndiversified taste, and more culinary uses than other stone-fruits; and\r\ngreater productiveness, more rapid growth and earlier fruiting of the\r\ntrees than most of the species of the genus. The place of the peach\r\nin the genus Prunus is thus easily established from a horticultural\r\npoint of view, but it is a much more difficult matter to make clear\r\nits botanical standing among the species with which it is considered\r\nbotanically related.\r\n\r\nThe botanical relations of the several stone-fruits to each other have\r\nbeen set forth in the foregoing books of this series on plums and\r\ncherries, but, for the convenience of those who may not have these\r\ntreatises, a summary of the relationships of the species of Prunus is\r\npresented. Besides, greater emphasis on several differences between\r\nthe peach and its congeners is needed. In particular, since some\r\nnotable naturalists have held that the peach is a modified almond, the\r\ndifferences between these two fruits must be more clearly set forth.\r\n\r\nNearly every botanist who has done much towards classifying plants has\r\ngrouped the stone-fruits according to a plan of his own and there are,\r\ntherefore, many classification schemes and consequently a most confused\r\nnomenclature for this genus. Happily, the pitfalls in synonomy dug by\r\nbotanists need not worry horticulturists; for each of the stone-fruits\r\nconstitutes a distinct horticultural group. In tree or fruit of peach,\r\nplum, cherry, apricot, or almond, who could mistake one for another?\r\nFor horticultural purposes we accept as best one of the oldest and yet\r\none of the most commonly used classifications which places in one genus\r\nall of the stone-fruits. What are the lines of cleavage between the\r\nseveral stone-fruits of common cultivation?\r\n\r\nStone-fruits fall naturally into two distinct groups. In the first the\r\nleaves are rolled in the buds--convolute. The plums and the apricots\r\nbelong to this section. In the buds of the other group the leaves are\r\nfolded lengthwise along the midrib--conduplicate. To this section\r\nbelong almonds, peaches and cherries. The two sections seem to be\r\nunited in this matter of disposition of leaves in the bud, it should\r\nbe said in passing, by a few species of American plums which are\r\nconduplicate in vernation. The second section is further subdivided\r\nby very marked differences in the fruits. The fruits of the peach\r\nand almond are larger than those of the cherry, less juicy,--in the\r\ncase of the almond almost dry,--hirsute (except in the nectarine),\r\nand are borne without stems; and the blossoms usually appear long\r\nbefore the opening of the leaves. Cherry-fruits are always juicy,\r\nusually glabrous, and are borne on more or less distinct stems; and\r\nthe blossoms appear with the leaves. Botanists who put these fruits in\r\none genus usually redivide according to the characters given so that\r\nthe plum and apricot stand in one sub-genus (Euprunus), the almond and\r\npeach in another (Amygdalus), and the cherry in a third (Cerasus).\r\n\r\nDifferentiating more closely, we find that it is not so easy to\r\ndistinguish between the peach and the almond. The likenesses are so\r\nmany and so apparent that it is not to be wondered that Knight, whose\r\ntheory we have discussed on a foregoing page, came to the conclusion\r\nthat the peach is a modified almond, or that Darwin, with his belief\r\nthat plants came sooner or later to express their environmental\r\nconditions, should be inclined to believe that the peach is an\r\nevolution from the almond. It is easy to imagine that countless ages\r\nago--how long since is but an invitation to argue--the two species\r\nmerged into one. Offspring of the parent-species once established in\r\ndistinct soil and climatic conditions--the peach in China, the almond\r\nin southwestern Asia--differentiation began and in time each region was\r\nrepresented by a species of its own. Such an occurrence is but one of\r\nthe commonplaces of evolution; but Knight, Lindley and Darwin thought\r\nthey saw evidence that the separation came after the almond, the\r\nsupposed parent-species, had been domesticated, the steps being from\r\nfleshy almond to bad clingstone, to good clingstone, to freestone,\r\nto nectarine. The arguments against such a descent have been given\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe chief differences between the two species are to be found in the\r\nmatured fruits though, at first thought, it might appear that these are\r\nnot greater than those found in widely separated varieties of either of\r\nthe two species. The fruits of the peach and the almond are, however,\r\nmuch more widely separated than any of the varieties of either species,\r\ninasmuch as the differences are several and have to do with parts not\r\nusually affected by cultivation and not the subject of selection by the\r\ncultivator. Thus, the fruit of the peach is a delectable esculent; that\r\nof the almond inedible; the flesh of the peach, the mesocarp, is soft,\r\nfleshy, juicy; that of the almond thin, tough and leathery; the pit\r\nof the peach must be removed while that of the almond drops naturally\r\nfrom the hard flesh which splits at maturity. The differences between\r\nthe pits of the two species are quite as marked as in the flesh of the\r\nfruit. The pit of the peach is deeply sculptured, pitted, and of a\r\nbone-like consistency; that of the almond is nearly smooth and in most\r\nvarieties is much thinner and of softer texture. The differences in the\r\nkernels are such as could easily be brought about by selection, some\r\npeach-kernels being sweet and edible and some almond-kernels being too\r\nbitter to be palatable.\r\n\r\nComing to the tree-characters we find that there are several which\r\ndiffer sufficiently to give each of the two fruits distinct specific\r\nrank. The winter aspect of the two trees is wholly different. The\r\nalmond resembles a young apple tree in color of bark more than it\r\ndoes the peach and has, too, a head much like that of a broad-topped,\r\nmuch-branched apple. In foliage the distant aspect is much the same,\r\nbut examined closely there are several distinctions that hold in\r\ncomparing the two species. The leaves of the peach are more broadly\r\nlanceolate than those of the almond, coarsely serrate or crenate while\r\nthe margins of almond-leaves are finely serrate. The glands on the\r\nleaf-stalk or leaf of the peach are globose, reniform or mixed; on the\r\nalmond, the glands are globose. The flowers in the two species are\r\nsimilar but the time of flowering is markedly different. The color of\r\nthe petals in both varies from pale pink to deep pink with occasional\r\npure white forms; the flowers of true almonds are always large while\r\nthose of the peach are about equally divided between large and small.\r\nThe almond, in New York, is out of bloom before flowers of the peach\r\nappear, the difference in blooming-time being from one to three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE- AND FRUIT-CHARACTERS OF THE PEACH\r\n\r\nFruit-growers must largely depend on printed descriptions for knowledge\r\nof varieties. A well-made description of tree or fruit, to one\r\nmentally equipped to interpret it, is second only to having the real\r\nobjects at hand. But the difficulty is that few excepting professional\r\npomologists know the characters of even the common fruits and their\r\nrelative importance. Before taking up either botanical or horticultural\r\ndescriptions of peaches, then, it is necessary to direct attention to\r\nthe characters of the peach, differences in which distinguish species\r\nand varieties. Be it remembered in this study of the characters of the\r\npeach, however, that, as fields and woods offer better facilities for\r\nthe botanist than the herbarium, so the peach-orchard is a fitter place\r\nto study the characters of the peach than a printed page.\r\n\r\nThe single species of the peach in which we are greatly interested\r\nhas a very characteristic tree, the variations in which are, however,\r\nless well marked than those of the tree of any other of our common\r\nfruits. The peach-tree is distinguished by its low, roundish and never\r\npyramidal head. Of its gross characters, size is most important in\r\ndistinguishing varieties, the several more or less distinct types in\r\nthe species usually being separable by size alone. In considering size,\r\nproper allowance must, of course, always be made for environment. There\r\nare no true dwarfs among the varieties of _Prunus persica_ cultivated\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nHabit of growth is nearly as important as size of tree in determining\r\nvarieties. Thus, a variety may be round-topped, upright-spreading or\r\ndrooping in habit; the head may be open or dense; the branches long or\r\nshort, stout or slender; the trunks may be short or long, straight or\r\ncrooked, much branched or little branched. These habits of growth serve\r\nnot only to distinguish sorts but often determine whether the tree is\r\nsufficiently manageable to make a good orchard-plant.\r\n\r\nHardiness is an important character both in classifying and in\r\ndetermining the orchard-value of a variety. All peaches are tender to\r\ncold as compared with other tree-fruits of temperate climates but there\r\nis sufficient difference in varieties to permit the designations hardy,\r\nhalf-hardy and tender. In the classificatory scheme in most common use\r\nin America, that of Onderdonk and Price, variation in hardiness is the\r\nchief determinant of groups.\r\n\r\nAll peaches come in bearing so early and bear so regularly that\r\nvarietal differences in these characters scarcely count in classifying,\r\nbut productiveness varies very characteristically in different\r\nvarieties. Environment and care greatly influence fruitfulness yet,\r\nnotwithstanding, the quantity of fruit borne is often a means of\r\nidentifying a variety and, of course, must always be considered by the\r\ncultivator and the breeder.\r\n\r\nResistance to disease and insects is a taxonomic and an economic\r\ncharacter of much importance. Thus there are great variations among\r\nvarieties in resistance to peach-yellows, brown-rot and leaf-curl, the\r\nthree commonest diseases of this fruit in New York, as there is also\r\nin resistance to San Jose scale, the worst insect-pest of the peach in\r\nthis region and to the peach-borer, the commonest. These examples are\r\nmultiplied in the discussions of varieties, pains having been taken in\r\nthe peach-orchards at this Station to determine the relative resistance\r\nof all varieties to the pests of this region.\r\n\r\nBut little attention need be paid to the old bark on peach-trees,\r\nsince in all varieties it is much the same and is unimportant to the\r\ncultivator. The bark of all varieties varies in color on different\r\nsoils and is always of a lighter hue in cold than in warm regions, in\r\ndry than in wet situations.\r\n\r\nThe branches and branchlets of varieties are very characteristic. The\r\nlength, thickness, direction, rigidity and the branching angle are all\r\nstable characters of varieties, changing but little with differences\r\nin soil and climate. The length of the internode is important as is\r\nalso color, smoothness, amount of pubescence, size and appearance\r\nof the lenticels, and the presence of excrescences,--though all are\r\nexceedingly variable.\r\n\r\nBoth leaf-buds and fruit-buds are used in separating groups of\r\npeaches but are too nearly alike in the several groups to be of aid\r\nin distinguishing the varieties of any group. Fruit-buds are borne\r\nin pairs on the wood of the previous year with a leaf-bud separating\r\nthe members of the pair. The only characters of buds worth noting are\r\nsize, shape, color and the angle at which the buds stand out from the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nAfter the fruits, the leaves offer the best means of determining\r\ngroups and varieties of peaches. Leaves are variable, it is true, but\r\nusually within limits quite easily set, since the conditions causing\r\nthe variations are easily discovered. The most usual ones are extremes\r\nin soil, moisture, light, heat and the age of the wood upon which the\r\nleaves are borne. Much care has been taken to illustrate as accurately\r\nas possible the leaves of the varieties given color-plates in this\r\ntext, size and form being reproduced exactly and color as nearly as\r\ncolor-plate printing permits.\r\n\r\nLeaf-size and leaf-form are the first characters of the foliage\r\nto study in determining varieties. The former varies somewhat in\r\naccordance with the conditions named in the foregoing paragraph but the\r\nshape of the leaf changes but little. Fortunately for the student of\r\nvarieties, leaves differ most in relative length and breadth so that\r\nthe shape may be accurately indicated by figures which are used in\r\nmost of the descriptions in _The Peaches of New York_. Comparisons of\r\nthe bases and the apices of leaves of different varieties often show\r\ndistinguishing marks.\r\n\r\nThe color of leaves in varieties is very constant for both surfaces.\r\nThe color of the foliage gives an aspect to peaches whereby a variety\r\nmay often be distinguished in its summer dress at considerable\r\ndistance. Unfortunately, the colors of leaves in the color-plates in\r\nthis book cannot be relied upon to give much help in studying this\r\ncharacter. Autumnal tints are uniformly the same in peaches and not to\r\nbe relied upon in classifying varieties.\r\n\r\nSeveral other characters of the leaves must be studied by the\r\nsystematic pomologist. The leaves of some varieties are thinner than\r\nthose of others, hence thickness becomes a distinguishing character.\r\nVenation of leaves--size and arrangement of veins--is important.\r\nPubescence of leaves cuts quite a figure in the descriptions of many\r\nfruits but in the peach is of minor importance because the leaves are\r\nnot very hairy and the quantity and character of the pubescence is\r\nexceedingly variable. Some varieties have relatively few leaves--others\r\nmany. The leaves of some varieties fall early--others relatively late.\r\n\r\nThe margins of peach-leaves offer valuable evidence in determining\r\nvarieties. They may be serrate or crenate, doubly or singly divided,\r\nglandular or glandless. Both serrations and glands are best studied\r\nin the middle of the sides of leaves, those at the base or apex often\r\nbeing crowded or wanting.\r\n\r\nPetioles differ in length, thickness, rigidity, pubescence and\r\ncolor, so that this organ is often a substantial help in identifying\r\nvarieties. Some say the color of the petiole is correlated with that\r\nof the fruit, as it certainly is in such extreme sorts as Snowball and\r\nIndian Cling, but it is doubtful whether this correlation goes further\r\nthan groups and even here does not always hold. Stipules offer no\r\ndistinguishing marks of importance.\r\n\r\nMuch use is made in classifying peaches of the presence or absence,\r\nthe size, color, shape, position and number of glands on the base of\r\nthe leaf or on the leaf-stalk. These glands may be either stalked or\r\nsessile. The terms used in describing glands are easily understood and\r\nneed no definition unless it be a few words in regard to the shape.\r\nGlobose glands are small globes, reniform glands are kidney-shaped. In\r\ndetermining the form of glands examinations must be made several times\r\nin the season, the end of the summer offering the best opportunity and\r\neven then care must be taken to secure old leaves. Glands are less\r\nvariable in adult trees than in trees not yet in bearing. Pomologists\r\nfor a hundred years have noted the fact that peaches with glandless\r\nleaves are very susceptible to mildew. We find this to be the case on\r\nthe grounds of this Station. This correlation between glandlessness and\r\nmildew may account for the fact that peaches with glandless leaves are\r\nrapidly disappearing from American peach-lists. Wickson says it has\r\nbeen found that peaches with glandless leaves resist leaf-curl.[163]\r\n\r\nGregory has made a careful study of the glands on peach-leaves.[164] We\r\npublish here the most important facts he brings out.\r\n\r\n\"In a large number of cases the glands are stable and can be safely\r\nused to aid in the identification of certain varieties. There are also\r\nvarieties in which the glands are exceptionally unstable, being on the\r\nborder line between the two types--reniform and globose--and having\r\nwhat might be termed mixed glands. These mixed glands are of two kinds:\r\none in which the majority of the glands are reniform, with some globose\r\nintermingled; the other in which the globose form predominates. It\r\nwould be quite possible, as Carriere (1867) suggests, to distinguish a\r\nthird type of glands--the mixed type.\r\n\r\nIt is important that leaves should be chosen from healthy branches\r\non bearing trees. It is also best to obtain a large number of leaves\r\nor to examine the tree carefully before making the final selection of\r\nleaves. Mature leaves are best because their glands are full-sized\r\nand correctly shaped, while on young leaves the form of the glands is\r\nusually obscure. This is particularly true of the reniform glands. On\r\nthe other hand, old, partly decayed, globose glands frequently have\r\nmuch the appearance of reniform glands.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the glands shows that they are true glands, having an\r\nupper layer of long, rectangular, secretory cells that produce a sweet\r\nsubstance, the function of which is not apparent. After the glands\r\nhave ceased secreting they begin to decay, becoming brown on the upper\r\nsurface and slowly disappearing until almost nothing is left. This\r\ndecaying is a very complicated process, being preceded in every case by\r\na suberization and thickening of the cell walls.\r\n\r\nThe spines of the leaf are very similar to the glands in structure,\r\nhaving the same upper layer of long cells, but with much more heavily\r\ncutinized walls. A study of the transitional forms indicates that the\r\nglands are merely modified leaf spines.\r\n\r\nThe leaves with reniform glands are apparently the highest type\r\nand the glandless leaves the lowest, with the transition through\r\nthe globose type. In support of this view is the fact that whenever\r\ntypically glandless leaves become possessed of glands they are always\r\nof the globose type.\r\n\r\nThe serrations of the glandless leaves are very strikingly different\r\nfrom those on a leaf with glands. The former leaves are deeply and\r\ndoubly serrate, while the margins of the latter are always single and\r\ncrenate. Almost invariably, when glands develop on a normally glandless\r\nleaf, the serrations are transformed to crenations, indicating that\r\nthere is a very close correlation between the glands and the crenations\r\non the edges of the leaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe French pomologists, Poiteau and Turpin,[165] seem to have first\r\nmade note of the glands in describing peaches, recording their\r\ndiscovery by M. Desprez in the nurseries at the Luxembourg in 1810,\r\nafter which, for a half-century, French, English and German pomologists\r\nregarded them as an infallible means of distinguishing varieties. But,\r\nby the middle of the Nineteenth Century, classifiers began to give them\r\nup because of their variability on leaves of trees of the same variety\r\nor even on the same tree. Even Darwin made note of their insufficiency\r\nin taxonomic work.[166] Now, no one familiar with any considerable\r\nnumber of varieties of peaches would attach very great importance to\r\nglands in a system of classification.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of peaches are very characteristic, helping to delineate\r\nthe groups in the several classificatory schemes of various pomologists\r\nand being ample to identify not a few varieties. Peach-flowers differ\r\nin time of appearance; in length of blooming-season; they may be large,\r\nmedium or small; pink, rose and rarely white; borne on pedicels of\r\nvarying length, thickness, color and pubescence; and both the floral\r\nand reproductive organs have modifications of their several structures.\r\nThe size, color and shape of peach-flowers are well shown in the first\r\nsix color-plates. In some species of Prunus, as some of the plums,\r\nthe reproductive organs differ greatly in ability to perform their\r\nfunctions, but the blossoms of edible peaches are seemingly always\r\nself-fertile and there are less often the mal-formations found in the\r\nreproductive organs of some plums.\r\n\r\nA well-marked correlation[167] between the color in the inside of\r\nthe calyx-cup and the color of the flesh of the fruit is one of the\r\ndistinguishing features of peaches. Yellow-fleshed peaches develop\r\nfrom blossoms in which the inside color of the calyx-cup is orange;\r\nwhite-fleshed peaches develop from those in which the color is greenish\r\nor greenish-yellow sometimes approaching a very light orange easily\r\ndistinguished from the dark orange of the other group. Since the\r\ndiscovery of this correlation in the Station orchards by Mr. Charles\r\nTubergen it has been in yearly use and has enabled us to tell a year\r\nor two in advance the flesh-color of seedling peaches, since the first\r\npeach-blossoms seldom set fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruits, however, furnish by far the best characters upon which\r\nto found a classification of peaches. The simplest classification\r\nof peaches begins by separating them into smooth-skinned and\r\npubescent sorts; each of these divisions is redivided into\r\nclingstones and freestones; these four groups may then be separated\r\ninto yellow-fleshed, white-fleshed and red-fleshed peaches; still\r\nfurther, most, not all, of the twelve groups made in the first three\r\ndivisions, separate into round, flat or beaked peaches. These are\r\nthe major characters of the fruits, little influenced by cultivation\r\nor environment, after which there are many minor characters such as\r\nsize, shape, color, quality and season, all very responsive to changed\r\nconditions, that help to describe definitely the many varieties of\r\n_Prunus persica_. The most variable of the minor characters is shape,\r\nall peaches tending to lose rotundity in southern climates and to\r\nbecome oblong and beaked. The length and quantity of the pubescence on\r\npeaches vary considerably in different soils--the warmer and lighter\r\nthe soil, the less pubescence. The skin adheres closely to the flesh in\r\nsome varieties; in others it is non-adherent.\r\n\r\nThe characters found in the stones of the many species of Prunus\r\nare of great value in determining species but they help but little\r\nin determining the horticultural varieties of any one species. The\r\nstones of the peach do vary, however, very materially in size, shape,\r\ngrooves and ridges, pitting and in characteristics at base and apex.\r\nThe color-plates in this text illustrate these differences very well.\r\nOne may generalize and say that the stones of the freestones are more\r\ndeeply furrowed and that the sides are smoother than in the clingstones.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the peach are set forth on the opposite page by\r\nreproducing a description as made at this Station in describing a\r\nvariety for _The Peaches of New York_. Such a description is, however,\r\nbut a skeleton, as dead as dry bones, unless a living picture of the\r\nvariety be made by filling out and covering the skeleton with ample\r\nremarks made as the describer studies the plant in the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEACH]\r\n\r\nA more detailed discussion of the horticultural and botanical\r\ncharacters of the peach logically follows here.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNUS PERSICA Stokes.\r\n\r\n   1. _P.

The specific name, _persica_,\r\ncommemorates the old belief that the peach came from Persia. The common\r\nname, peach, in English, as in most European languages, is a derivative\r\nfrom _persica_. Amygdalus, found several times in the synonomy, is\r\nthe Syrian name of the almond. The drupe-fruits are put in two, three\r\nand sometimes four genera by various botanists but in the fruit-books\r\nissued by this Station, following most botanists and pomologists, all\r\nare put in a single genus, Prunus. Such lumping of several distinct\r\nfruits into one genus has its disadvantages but the several fruits\r\ncannot be reasonably separated because outliers closely connect\r\nall. Hybridization between the cultivated stone-fruits adds to the\r\nperplexities of classification.\r\n\r\n_Prunus persica_ is variously divided by botanists and pomologists.\r\nQuite commonly two botanical varieties of edible peaches are split\r\noff, as shown in the synonomy, to separate the nectarine and the flat\r\npeaches from the pubescent and globular peaches. But these sub-species,\r\noriginating over and over in the case of the nectarine as a bud or\r\nseed-mutation and the flat peaches probably having originated as a\r\nmutation, are not more distinct from the parent species than the\r\nred-fleshed sorts, the snowball peaches, the Yellow Transvaals from\r\nSouth Africa, the nippled peach, the cleft peach, the beaked peach, the\r\nwinter peaches of China, or the pot-grown dwarfs from China; in fact,\r\nare not more different from other peaches than a clingstone is from a\r\nfreestone, a yellow flesh from a white flesh or a large-flowered from a\r\nsmall-flowered sort. All constitute merely pomological groups, which,\r\nmore and more, are becoming interminably confused by hybridization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALTON (Large Flowered)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOOD LEAF]\r\n\r\nWe name but one sub-species of _Prunus persica_, and that doubtful.\r\nMr. Frank N. Meyer of the United States Department of Agriculture has\r\nrecently introduced into the United States cuttings of a wild peach\r\nfrom the province of Kansu, China, which he thinks has horticultural\r\nvalue. The peach is _Prunus persica potanini_ Batalin (_Act. Hort.\r\nPetrop._ =12=:164. 1892) which Mr. Meyer describes as follows:[168]\r\n\r\n\"A wild peach of the _davidiana_ type, but differing from it in\r\nvarious points. Collected at the base of sheltered mountains at an\r\nelevation of 4300 feet. A tall shrub or even small tree, up to 30 feet\r\nin height, bark of stem or trunk dark reddish-brown and quite smooth\r\nin the younger shoots; leaves like those of _Amygdalus davidiana_\r\nbut often broader in the middle and always less pointed. Fruits of\r\nround-elongated form; skin covered with a heavy down, no edible flesh;\r\nstones of elliptical shape, grooves longer than in _A. davidiana_,\r\nshells very hard and thick, kernels elongated and relatively small.\r\nFound growing at elevations from 4000 to 7000 feet, in side valleys\r\naway from the Siku river; thrives especially well in sheltered and warm\r\nmountain pockets. Of value especially as a stock for stone-fruits and\r\npossibly able to stand even more dry heat than _A. davidiana_; also\r\nrecommended as an ornamental spring-flowering tree, especially for the\r\ndrier parts of the United States. Chinese name _Mao t'ao_, meaning\r\n'hairy peach.'\"\r\n\r\nThere are many ornamental forms of the peach-tree--sorts with single or\r\ndouble flowers, white, pink or red in color, normal, red or variegated\r\nfoliage and standard or dwarf trees. The best-known named ornamental\r\npeaches are _camelliaeflora_ with large, carmine flowers and its\r\nsub-variety, _plena_, with double flowers; _versicolor_ with different\r\ncolored flowers on branches of the same tree; _atropurpurea_ with\r\nbrownish-red foliage; _foliis rubris_, similar or possibly the same as\r\nthe preceding, the color in both extending to the fruit; _magnifica_,\r\na semi-double with brilliant carmine-crimson flowers; _pyramidalis_, a\r\npyrimidal form; _pendula_, a weeping peach; and still others, of the\r\ndistinctness of which we cannot be certain, as _dianthi-alba-plena_,\r\n_rubro-plena_, and _coccineo-plena_. With these ornamentals we are not\r\nto be further concerned.\r\n\r\nOf Japanese garden-forms the following varieties have been described:\r\n_P. Persica_ var. _densa_ Makimo _Tokyo Bot. Mag._ =16=:178. 1902. _P.\r\npersica_ var. _vulgaris_, f. _stellata_ Makimo l. c. =22=:119. 1908.\r\n_P. Persica_ var. _vulgaris_, f. _praematura_ Makimo l. c. =22=:119.\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nSpecies are but convenient groups, their limits reflecting the\r\njudgment of the species-maker. Were the authors of this text to\r\ndivide _Prunus persica_, the cleavage lines would be other than\r\nthose indicated in the foregoing paragraphs. _Prunus persica_ might\r\nbe divided, though there is no intention of furthering confusion\r\nby the addition of new names, into two species. One would include\r\nthe white-fleshed, clingstone peaches, with large flowers and calyx\r\ngreenish-yellow inside; the other the yellow-fleshed, freestone\r\npeaches, with small flowers and calyx-cups orange inside. Primitive\r\nforms in China indicate such a division, the evolution of varieties\r\nsuggests it and the present disposition of the characters named as\r\nseparating these theoretical species attest the reasonableness of such\r\na separation. The primitive forms have been described and the descent\r\nof varieties may be traced in the last two chapters, so that we need\r\nonly amplify the statement as to the present disposition of characters.\r\n\r\nThe characters in the two hypothetical species have been thoroughly\r\nshuffled by hybridization but even if there is not correlation, as\r\nthere certainly is between color in calyx-cup and color of flesh,\r\nit might be expected that those associated in the primitive plant,\r\nthe Adam of the race, would, despite the shuffling, still be most\r\noften associated. What are the facts? In the Station orchard are\r\n109 white-fleshed peaches; 40 per ct. of these are semi-cling or\r\nclingstones leaving 60 per ct. nearly or quite free (there is\r\nconstant selection for freestones); 64 per ct. have large flowers;\r\nall have calyx-cups yellowish-green inside. There are in this orchard\r\n106 yellow-fleshed peaches; but 17 per ct. of these are cling or\r\nsemi-cling, the remainder being either quite free or nearly so; 73 per\r\nct. have small or medium-sized flowers; all have calyx-cups deeply\r\ncolored with orange inside.\r\n\r\nSimilarities in characters indicate so close a relationship between the\r\nalmond and the peach that one might well suspect many hybrids between\r\nthe two. Yet there appear to be but few clear cases of peach and almond\r\ncrosses. Knight[169] reports crossing the two, the doubtful results\r\nof which led him to believe, as we have seen, that the peach is but\r\na modified almond. Several such crosses are indicated in botanical\r\nliterature[170] but whether all refer to one or several supposed\r\ncrosses there is no way of knowing--probably to one. The almond blooms\r\nso much earlier than the peach that crosses could hardly occur in\r\nnature. A hybrid between the two from which could be evolved a\r\nlate-blooming almond is a consummation to be wished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE FREE (Medium Flowered)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSBY (Small Flowered)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NECTARINE\r\n\r\nThe nectarine is a hairless peach. The tree differs in no respect\r\nfrom that of the peach and besides the absence of pubescence the only\r\nother distinguishing marks between the fruits are smaller size, firmer\r\nflesh, greater aroma and a distinct and richer flavor in nectarines.\r\nEven the varieties of the two fruits correspond in characters. Thus,\r\nthere are clingstone and freestone sorts of each; both may have red,\r\nyellow, or white flesh; the flowers of both may be large or small;\r\nnectarine leaves, in one variety or another, show all the variations in\r\nglands and serrations known to the peach; and the stones and kernels\r\nare indistinguishable. There seem to be no records so far, however, of\r\nflat or beaked nectarines, abnormalities each represented in several\r\nvarieties of peaches. The two fruits are adapted to the same soil and\r\nclimatic conditions and wherever the peach is grown, the world over,\r\nthe nectarine is found.\r\n\r\nThe established history of the nectarine goes back 2000 years and then\r\nmerges into that of the peach. Despite the fact that De Candolle[171]\r\n\"sought in vain for a proof that the nectarine existed in Italy in the\r\ntime of ancient Rome,\" we are convinced that Pliny's \"duracinus\" is\r\nthe nectarine. Matthiolus[172] in 1554 discusses Pliny's statements\r\nconcerning the kinds of peaches at length and concludes that the\r\nauthor's \"duracinus\" is the peach. Dalechamp, in 1587, and J. Bauhin,\r\nin 1650, both describe nectarines after which botanists and pomologists\r\ninvariably include this fruit. In the Sixteenth and Seventeenth\r\nCenturies the nectarine was called \"nucipersica\" because it resembled\r\nin smoothness and color of the outer skin as well as in size and shape,\r\nthe walnut. \"Nectarine,\" the meaning of the word obvious, appears first\r\nto have been used for this fruit, in the English language at least,\r\nby Parkinson in 1629 who describes six varieties[173] and gives us\r\nthe information \"they have been with us not many years.\" Gerarde,\r\nthe great English herbalist, 1597, does not mention them. We find the\r\nnectarine first mentioned in America in 1722 by Robert Beverly in his\r\n_History of Virginia_, who, after discussing the culture of peaches,\r\nnectarines and apricots, says (pages 259, 260): \"Peaches and nectarines\r\nI believe to be spontaneous, somewhere or other on that continent, for\r\nthe Indians have, and ever had greater variety, and finer sorts of them\r\nthan the English.\"\r\n\r\nThe nectarine is one of the most interesting phenomena in horticulture.\r\nIt is the classical example of bud- and seed-variation, furnishing more\r\ninstances of mutation, and these more instructive, than have yet come\r\nfrom any other fruit. Darwin, with the magnificent exhaustiveness which\r\ncharacterized his method, brought together in _Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication_[174] a striking array of facts which leaves nothing\r\nto be added as to the manner in which the peach and nectarine are\r\nreciprocally reproduced the one from the other. He shows by numerous\r\nexamples: (1) That nectarines may spring from peach-stones and peaches\r\nfrom nectarine-stones. (2) That peach-trees produce nectarines by\r\nbud-variation and nectarine-trees likewise produce peaches, and that\r\neither the nectarines or peaches so arising will come true to seed.\r\n(3) That either peach or nectarine-trees may produce individual fruits\r\nhalf-nectarine and half-peach. (4) A case is cited of a nectarine tree\r\nbearing a half-and-half fruit and subsequently a true peach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENTUCKY (Nectarine)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUMMER SNOW (White Flowered)]\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that in all of the variations so far recorded there\r\nare no intermediate forms between the two fruits. The peach produced\r\nin these bud-variations is a peach and nothing but a peach; the\r\nnectarine, a nectarine and nothing but a nectarine. Even in those\r\nremarkable phenomena, of which several are recorded, in which the\r\nfruits are divided into halves or quarters, one or more segments being\r\npeach and one or more nectarine, there can be no mistake as to peach\r\nand nectarine in pubescence, color or flavor. The nectarine from the\r\npeach, thus becomes as clear-cut a case of discontinuous variation as\r\ncan be. If we accept the mutation theory of the origin of species--new\r\nspecies arising suddenly at a single step--the nectarine is a species\r\nin process of birth.\r\n\r\nAs yet we are entirely ignorant in regard to the conditions under which\r\nthe peach or the nectarine sports, the one producing the other. It is\r\nwholly a natural phenomenon, for no one has been able to cause the\r\npeach to produce the hairless form or the nectarine to bring forth a\r\ndowny fruit. The relations of the two fruits have furnished a fertile\r\nfield of inquiry for over a century but the problem is one of those\r\nmysterious ones in which there are many facts that cannot be fitted\r\ninto a theory, so that our ignorance is as profound now as ever. There\r\nare, however, several theories which, without going into full detail,\r\nneed to be stated.\r\n\r\nThe oldest notion is that the production of a nectarine on a peach-tree\r\nis due to the direct action of pollen from some nearby nectarine-tree\r\non the ovary of the peach. This theory, wholly at variance with\r\npresent knowledge, is also discredited by the many instances in which\r\nthe sports occur when the two fruits are not growing in the same\r\nneighborhood or even region. Thus, within ten years, several cases\r\nof nectarines on peach-trees have occurred in this State where the\r\nnectarine is scarcely known. Besides, crossing these fruits shows no\r\ndirect effect of pollen--as is true with nearly all other plants. Still\r\nfurther, when a branch of a peach has borne a nectarine it usually goes\r\non year after year producing nectarines; and certainly impregnation of\r\na flower by foreign pollen could not so profoundly modify a branch.\r\nThere is so little foundation for this belief that it would not be\r\nmentioned were it not that many fruit-growers still look to the action\r\nof pollen as the explanation of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAnother, and a much more probable explanation, is that every sporting\r\npeach or nectarine-tree is a more or less remote hybrid. There is a\r\ngrowing belief that species are fixed and that crossing is the only\r\nsource of new seed- or bud-forms. Certainly all who have crossed\r\nplants in any considerable numbers know that hybridity is at least one\r\ncause, and a frequent one, of mutations. It is possible that sometime\r\nin the past the peach and the nectarine were crossed, the offspring\r\nshowing no trace of the cross, and that now there is an occasional\r\ndisassociation of the characters brought together by such crossing.\r\nThere are several objections to this hypothesis. One is that two forms\r\nsufficiently distinct to induce so striking a variation as a nectarine\r\nfrom a peach, must have differed in tree as well as in fruit-characters\r\nand that these differences would crop out just as smoothness of fruit\r\nso frequently does. Another, and less potent objection, is that the\r\nnectarine has never been found wild, that it never becomes naturalized,\r\nthat it is shorter-lived and less vigorous and behaves in general like\r\nan artificial plant.\r\n\r\nThe third, and at present the most acceptable theory, is that we have\r\nin the nectarine from the peach what De Vries calls a retrogressive\r\nmutation. That is, an active character, in this case pubescence on\r\nthe fruit, becomes latent and appears to be lost--a type of mutation\r\nfrequent among cultivated plants. The nectarine, then, is a peach\r\nwith one character subtracted. When the nectarine yields a peach, the\r\ncharacter is restored. The one is a negative, the other a positive\r\nstep; one is retrogressive, the other progressive mutation. The\r\nspeculations as to what causes these mutations are as yet too vague to\r\nbe profitable. Probably we can never make use of the cause by which\r\nmutations arise or of the conditions leading to them until we can\r\ninduce these strange variations. That they are due to disturbances in\r\nthe processes of cell-division is the theory now current--sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive and sufficiently vague to be a most convenient\r\nexplanation, at any rate.\r\n\r\nNectarines do not attain the perfection in New York reached west of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. The trees, possibly, are a little less manageable\r\nin the orchard, less vigorous and certainly more susceptible to pests.\r\nNectarines, in particular, suffer more than peaches from the scourge\r\nof the crescent sign, curculio, a pest which finds all smooth-skinned\r\nstone-fruits much to its taste and the nectarine more than others.\r\nThen, too, whether fresh, canned or dried, fruit-buyers in America\r\nprefer the peach. This discrimination in favor of the peach is largely\r\ndue to lack of knowledge of the nectarine, which, though different\r\nfrom the commoner fruit, is equally delectable, fresh or preserved,\r\nand certainly is a handsomer product preserved either by canning\r\nor evaporating. Indeed, the dried nectarine, with its beautiful,\r\ntranslucent, amber hue is the most attractive of all cured fruits.\r\nThe nectarine-industry, however, belongs to California, where all\r\nconditions favor production, canning and curing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENTUCKY (Nectarine)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWTON (Nectarine)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNUS DAVIDIANA (Carrière) Franchet\r\n\r\n    _P.

Some ten or twelve years ago the species was distributed by\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture, trees being received at\r\nthis Station in the spring of 1906. Meanwhile, agricultural explorers\r\nrepresenting this country in China have discovered that the species is\r\nmuch used by the Chinese as a stock upon which to work other species of\r\nPrunus. Whereupon, new distributions were made through seeds and plants\r\nto nearly every fruit-growing state in the Union. We are, therefore,\r\nnow able to speak of the behavior of the Davidiana peach in America\r\nwith some degree of confidence as to its future as a stock for peaches.\r\nBut, first, a word as to its habitat and uses in China.\r\n\r\nThe several importations of seeds recorded by the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture seem all to have been made from the province\r\nof Chili in China and from the cities of Pekin and Tientsin in the\r\nneighborhood of which the tree is commonly found wild. According to\r\nBretschneider,[177] the species was first discovered by Bunge near\r\nPeking in 1831 who took it to be an almond. The same authority says\r\nthat Father David's seeds came from wild trees growing in the mountains\r\nnear Jehol, and that the species is much cultivated in the gardens of\r\nPeking, there being two varieties, one with rose-colored and the other\r\nwith white flowers. At the time of its introduction into Europe, it\r\nwas considered, by some, the wild form of the cultivated peach. The\r\nfruit of David's peach is not edible and peach-growers would have but\r\npassing interest in the species as a very attractive ornamental were it\r\nnot for the fact that it is a common and most valuable stock, used for\r\ncenturies in China for several of the stone-fruits.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, with a view to its fitness as a stock that the Davidiana\r\npeach must be discussed. Its characters in several respects indicate\r\nthat it may make an invaluable stock in America as it has long been in\r\nChina. For this purpose it seems possible to use it equally well for\r\nseveral stone-fruits.\r\n\r\nAs it grows on the Station grounds the most experienced fruit-grower\r\ncannot guess whether _Prunus davidiana_ is a peach, nectarine, almond,\r\napricot or plum. As we shall show later, too, it hybridizes with\r\nseveral other species of its genus. Its similarities to all of these\r\nstone-fruits give a clue to its value as a stock--it may be used\r\nfor all. It is the commonest stock for all of these fruits in parts of\r\nChina and is sometimes used for the cherry as well. It is reported by\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture[178] to have been tried\r\nin commercial plantings of peaches, plums, apricots and almonds in\r\nCalifornia and Texas and for all is \"unusually promising.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS DAVIDIANA_]\r\n\r\nThe trees are vigorous, healthy, hardy, and resistant to drouth.\r\nConsorted with any stone-fruit it should impart these qualities in\r\nsome degree to the resulting tree. On the Station grounds, _Prunus\r\ndavidiana_ is growing with vigor and health despite the fact that in\r\nthe ten years of its existence here we have had all but record-breaking\r\nextremes of cold, heat, drouth and rain--a decade long to be noted\r\nfor its extremes of weather. It seems to stand the heat of Texas, and\r\nin Minnesota has withstood cold as low as forty degrees below zero, a\r\ntemperature which kills commercial varieties to the ground. It cannot\r\nbe fruited, however, in cold climates as its buds swell quickly with\r\nrises of temperature and succumb to subsequent cold; neither will it\r\nfruit in regions of late frost since it is one of the earliest species\r\nin the genus Prunus to flower. In Texas and southern California,\r\naccording to the United States Department of Agriculture, it is proving\r\nresistant to drouth and in the latter region to alkali as well. In very\r\ndry and exposed places, it is said to lose its tree-characters and to\r\nbecome a thrifty shrub.\r\n\r\nPresent nursery practices in growing peaches are unsatisfactory in\r\nthe extreme. More and more, pits from canneries are being planted\r\nfor stocks. The pits come from a great diversity of varieties and\r\nthe resulting seedlings are variable in vigor, health, size and\r\ncapacity to take the bud. Should no unsurmountable weaknesses appear\r\nin _Prunus davidiana_ it is almost certain that its seedlings will\r\nbe more satisfactory as stocks for the peach than those from either\r\ncannery pits or from pits grown on southern wild trees. The trees do\r\nnot fruit well in this climate, even when buds and flowers escape the\r\ncold, possibly because of infertility of bloom, and for this reason,\r\nthe chief objection so far, some favorable region would have to be\r\ndiscovered in which to grow the pits.\r\n\r\nAs one might suspect from its similarities to the several\r\nstone-fruits, _Prunus davidiana_ gives promise of being a go-between\r\nin hybridization. I. V. Mijurin, a noted Russian hybridist of Kozloo,\r\nRussia, has crossed the Davidiana peach and the dwarf almond, _Prunus\r\nnana_, with the idea of getting a hardy fruit for central Russia.\r\nThe resulting offspring, according to Mr. F. N. Meyer,[179] looks\r\nin tree like the peach-parent but the fruit is more like that of the\r\nalmond-parent. The fruit of the hybrid is inedible but the plant is a\r\nhandsome ornamental. Mr. Mijurin states that while neither of the two\r\nparents will hybridize with the common peach, this hybrid does. _Prunus\r\ndavidiana_, then, like the Sand Cherry of the Western Plains, may prove\r\nto be a valuable go-between in hybridizing species of Prunus.\r\n\r\nThe fruit has no comestible value. It is small, less than an inch in\r\ndiameter, nearly round, very downy, yellow at maturity, with thin,\r\ndry, tasteless flesh which parts readily from the stone even before\r\nfully ripe. As if to complete its worthlessness as an edible product,\r\nit begins to shrivel as maturity approaches and soon decays. In fruit,\r\neven more than in tree, it is an intermediate between the peach and the\r\nalmond.\r\n\r\nA word must be said as to the merits of _Prunus davidiana_ as an\r\nornamental. It is the first harbinger of spring in the great family\r\nto which it belongs, bursting into a profusion of white or pinkish\r\nflowers with the approach of warm weather even before forsythias are in\r\nflower. Its thickly set, erect branchlets are wands of pinkish-white\r\ntwo feet in length, making a handsome tree and furnishing beautiful\r\ncut-flowers. If grown for its flowers, however, one must be content\r\nin northern climates to have it in bloom only about one season out\r\nof three but even so it repays culture. The Chinese cultivate dwarf\r\nspecimens, possibly a dwarf form, for winter-flowering and the plant,\r\nit would seem, would readily lend itself to winter-forcing in American\r\nfloriculture. The tree, quite aside from its flowers, is handsome\r\nat all times. A form with pure white flowers is a very desirable\r\nornamental.[180] On the Station grounds this white-flowering peach has\r\na fastigiate habit of growth and resembles somewhat a small Lombardy\r\npoplar.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNUS MIRA Koehne.\r\n\r\n    _P. mira_ Koehne _Plant_. _Wilson._ Pt. 2, No. =4=:272. 1912.\r\n\r\n    Tree thirty feet in height; trunk sixteen inches in diameter;\r\n    branches very smooth, those of the current year's growth green,\r\n    the older ones dark reddish-yellow; flowering-season short;\r\n    stipules lacking or obscure; petioles five-sixteenths to\r\n    ten-sixteenths of an inch long, with from two to four glands\r\n    toward the apex, the glands broadly elliptical, disc-shaped;\r\n    leaf at the base usually roundly lanceolate, two to four\r\n    inches long, nine-sixteenths to one and one-sixteenth inches\r\n    broad, gradually narrowing toward the apex; margin broadly\r\n    crenulate-serrulate, tapering upward without division; teeth\r\n    crowned with small, soot-colored, mucronate glands; upper\r\n    surface clear green, glabrous; lower surface paler, villous\r\n    along both sides of the lower ribs and the rest glabrous; veins\r\n    on both sides twelve to sixteen, the veinlets somewhat raised\r\n    on the under side.\r\n\r\n    The pedicels of the single or twinned fruits two-sixteenths to\r\n    three-sixteenths of an inch long, very thick, glabrous; drupes\r\n    somewhat dry, sub-globose, one and one-eighth inches long,\r\n    one inch in diameter, densely tomentose, edible; stone ovate,\r\n    somewhat compressed, dimensions three-fourths by one-half by\r\n    three-eighths inches; dorsal suture keeled, the ventral surface\r\n    covered with narrow ridges, the ridges at the base of the keel\r\n    nearly disappearing, the rest inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n_Prunus mira_ is a new peach discovered in China by Mr. E.

The branches\r\nare relatively slender and the branchlets twiggy, and these, together\r\nwith the narrow, lance-shaped, long-pointed leaves, give the plant\r\na very distinct appearance. The fruit is roundish oval, about 4.5\r\ncm. high and 3.5-4 cm. broad, downy on the outside, with white flesh\r\nand a free stone. The flavor is the same as that of fruits from the\r\nsemi-wild plants of the Common Peach (_P. Persica_). The stone is 2 to\r\n2.2 cm. high and 1.3-1.4 cm. broad, and in shape is flattened ovoid and\r\npointed. The flowers are unknown to me.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows wild on rather barren mountain slopes at about\r\n3000m. altitude north of the town of Tachienlu on the China-Thibetan\r\nborderland, where it was first detected by me on July 9, 1908, and from\r\nwhence I introduced it by means of seeds in the autumn of 1910. I saw\r\nonly a few trees, but have reason to believe that it is fairly common,\r\nand also that it is thereabouts cultivated for its fruit. In the\r\nArnold Arboretum this species has proved no more hardy than the Common\r\nPeach, though from the altitude at which it grows naturally it ought\r\nto be the hardier plant. Our largest specimen is 2.5m. high and crown\r\n3m. through. It starts into growth and leafs out much later than the\r\nCommon Peach, and is therefore much less liable to be affected by late\r\nfrosts. This is the one advantage so far evident in our experience with\r\nthis new Peach under cultivation. Undoubtedly it possesses important\r\nhorticultural possibilities, and especially should it be valuable\r\nto the hybridist on account of its small and smooth stone. Indeed,\r\nit requires no imagination to realize the advantage to be gained by\r\nsupplanting in our present day race of garden peaches for the large\r\nand deeply furrowed stone one that is quite smooth and small.\"\r\n\r\n_Prunus mira_ is now under cultivation at the Arnold Arboretum near\r\nBoston, in the parks at Rochester, New York, on the grounds of this\r\nStation and at Brookville, Florida, in charge of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. No doubt within a few years we shall have\r\npositive evidence of its horticultural value.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBESCENT-FRUITED SPECIES OF PRUNUS FROM THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nSeven pubescent-fruited species of Prunus are found in the Southwestern\r\nStates. From reading the descriptions, it is hard to tell whether\r\nthese plants, unique in more than one respect, are most closely\r\nrelated to peaches, plums, apricots or almonds. Professor S. C. Mason\r\nof the United States Department of Agriculture, who has studied\r\nthese fruits,[181] thinks that some if not all of them may have\r\nhorticultural value, at least in the Southwest where fluctuations of\r\nheat and cold are great and drought and alkalinity of soil must be\r\nendured by plant-life. They deserve brief mention in _The Peaches of\r\nNew York_ because of the possibility that some of them can be used as\r\ndwarfing-stocks for the peach and possibly that some may be hybridized\r\nwith cultivated peaches. The species, with brief notes taken for most\r\npart from Mason, are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Prunus texana_ Dietrich, the \"wild peach\" of Texas, is a plum-like\r\nfruit from eastern Texas of which there are already several hybrids\r\nwith the wild plums of the region. _Prunus andersonii_ Gray is the\r\n\"wild almond\" or \"wild peach\" of Nevada. The species is found in\r\nwestern Nevada and eastern California in a region subject to severe\r\ncold in winter and extreme drought and heat in summer. One cultivator\r\nof this species suggests it as a good stock for the peach and the\r\nalmond and thinks it has possibilities for hybridization.[182] The\r\n\"desert apricot,\" _Prunus eriogyna_ Mason, comes from a very restricted\r\nregion in southern California. The characters of this species should\r\nfit it to endure the environment on the desert slopes of mountains.\r\nThe \"desert almond,\" _Prunus fasciculata_ Torrey, sometimes called\r\n\"wild peach\" and \"wild almond,\" ranges much farther south and east\r\nthan _Prunus andersonii_ in southern Nevada and southern California,\r\ncrossing into southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, and grows in\r\ngravels and sands where its roots penetrate to great depth. _Prunus\r\nminutiflora_ Engelman, the \"Texas almond,\" is found in southwestern\r\nTexas, a shrub which, like the former species and the one following, is\r\ndioecious, a marked and unique peculiarity of these three species. The\r\n\"Mexican almond,\" _Prunus microphylla_ Hemsley, is found in the high\r\nmountain region of Mexico. _Prunus havardii_ Wight, is known only in a\r\nrestricted region in western Texas. The last two species are so little\r\nknown that one cannot even surmise whether they may have horticultural\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE PEACH\r\n\r\nThe opening years of the Nineteenth Century mark the first attempts\r\nat classifying peaches. By 1818 as many as three classificatory\r\nschemes had been proposed, all being modifications of the same general\r\narrangement. July 7, 1818, John Robertson read a paper on classifying\r\npeaches and nectarines before the Horticultural Society of London.\r\nLater, this was printed in the Transactions of the Society[183]\r\ntogether with a classification by M. Poiteau from the _Bon Jardinier_\r\nand another by Count Lelieur from his _Pomone Francaise_. In January,\r\n1824, George Lindley read before the same society a classification\r\nwhich was but an extension of the older arrangements.[184]\r\n\r\nRobertson separated peaches into true peaches and nectarines and\r\nthese in turn into Classes, Divisions and Sub-divisions. He founded\r\nthe two classes on the presence or absence of glands; for each of his\r\nclasses he made two divisions distinguished by the size and color\r\nof the flowers; each of the four divisions is once redivided into a\r\nsub-division in which the flesh parts from the stone and another in\r\nwhich the flesh adheres to the stone. The two French writers use the\r\nsame characters but found their second division on the adherence or\r\nnon-adherence of the flesh to the stone; their third on the size of\r\nthe flower but making three partitions as to size; and their fourth\r\non the presence or absence of glands which they divide into globose\r\nand reniform. Lindley created three classes dependent on the presence\r\nor absence and the character of the glands and the character of the\r\nserrations; three divisions of each class in accordance as to whether\r\nthe flowers are large, medium-sized or small; two sub-divisions of each\r\ndivision to agree with the presence or absence of down; and for each\r\nsub-division two sections, one for clingstones and one for melters.\r\n\r\nThis was the age of the classifier and other classifications, all\r\nsimilar in plan, rapidly followed in England, France, Belgium and\r\nGermany. No one at this time seems to have attempted a natural\r\nclassification of peaches.\r\n\r\nOf the nine leading American pomological writers of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury, Coxe, Prince, Cole, Hooper, Elliott and Barry either do\r\nnot attempt to classify or make but one or two simple divisions.\r\nKenrick, 1832, follows Lindley in part but makes use of season in his\r\nclassification. Downing in his first edition, 1845, divides peaches\r\ninto freestones with pale flesh, freestones with deep yellow flesh and\r\nclingstones. This simple arrangement by Downing is notable only because\r\nit is the first time color of flesh is made use of as a distinguishing\r\nmark, the Europeans probably not having done so because yellow-fleshed\r\nvarieties are rare in Europe whereas in America they are as common or\r\nmore so than white-fleshed sorts. Thomas, in 1846, did not classify\r\nbut in later editions divided peaches into two divisions, founded\r\non adherence of flesh to the stone; two classes for each division\r\nin accordance with color of flesh; and three sections founded on\r\nleaf-serrations and glands.\r\n\r\nThese Nineteenth Century classifications are artificial. That is, they\r\nsingle out a few points of resemblance and difference and arrange\r\nvarieties in accordance with them, convenience and facility of use\r\nbeing the controlling principles. They are natural to a degree,\r\nhowever, because varieties agreeing in one point of structure commonly\r\nagree in other characters. With the peach, more than in the artificial\r\nclassification of most other fruits, the characters are readily\r\ndistinguished and are stable. Yet most English pomologies now arrange\r\nvarieties of peaches alphabetically, while the American texts do the\r\nsame or use the pseudo-natural system of Onderdonk. His classification\r\nwe are about to discuss. The early artificial arrangements failed to\r\nstand the test of time because classifiers could not agree upon any\r\none arrangement and added confusion by the multiplicity of them; and,\r\nbecause the new varieties of the last half-century, coming in great\r\nnumbers, are so poorly described that the great majority of them could\r\nnot be classified from the data at hand.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Gilbert Onderdonk,[185] a special agent of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, published a natural classification of\r\npeaches.[186] He put varieties of peaches into five groups which\r\nhe called races and to which he gave the names: Persian, Northern\r\nChinese, Spanish, Southern Chinese and Peento. He bounded peach-culture\r\nin America on the north by the Great Lakes and on the south by the\r\nGulf and divided this great region into five zones to each of which\r\nhe assigned one of his races. Onderdonk studied peaches in Texas and\r\nfound there remarkable distinguishing characters; as, in adaptations\r\nto southern climates, in length of the rest-period, in differences in\r\nleafing, blooming and fruiting-time, and in the organs of the plants.\r\nProfessor R. H. Price, working with a large number of varieties at the\r\nTexas Agricultural College, verified and greatly extended Onderdonk's\r\nobservations.[187] Eventually, Price became the pontifical authority\r\nin this country on the classification of peaches and in numerous\r\narticles and addresses set forth the Onderdonk grouping of varieties\r\nso convincingly that it was adopted by practically all American\r\npomologists and at present is in use, to some degree at least, in\r\nnearly all of our horticultural literature. It becomes necessary,\r\ntherefore, to scrutinize closely this natural classification of\r\nOnderdonk and Price.\r\n\r\nThe end to be attained in a classification of peaches, as in\r\nclassifying natural objects of any kind, is to provide an epitome of\r\nthe knowledge of the fruits classified. Incidentally, a classification\r\nhelps in the identification of varieties of peaches. Does the Onderdonk\r\nclassification serve these purposes? We have not found that it does. In\r\nmost arduous attempts to arrange the sorts of peaches growing on the\r\nStation grounds according to the Onderdonk plan, we have wholly failed.\r\nEven the varieties named as types do not fit, as they grow in the\r\nnorth, in the places provided for them by these southern classifiers.\r\nIndeed, we have wasted so much time and patience in attempting to\r\ngroup varieties according to Onderdonk and Price, and with so little\r\nsuccess, that the Onderdonk classification seems to us to be cursed\r\nwith the confusion of Babel. Since pomologists so generally accept\r\nthis classification, these words demand that it be shown wherein this\r\nattempt at a natural arrangement of varieties fails.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the basis of Onderdonk's classification, as\r\nthe names suggest, is regional variation. Each race stands for a\r\nregion, the Peento included--for the name is very obviously Chinese.\r\nIncompleteness, then, is the first fault of this system for there are\r\nother regions in which races of peaches just as distinct as those\r\nnamed have developed: as, for examples, the Bokhara represents a\r\nhardy \"Russian race;\" Yellow Transvaal belongs to the very peculiar\r\n\"South African race;\" in the rich alluvial lands of Egypt, the\r\n\"Egyptian race\" has developed; still another regional race is found\r\nin the evergreen peach of the West Indies. We have no doubt that\r\ndistinct races of peaches may have originated or will arise in the\r\nCanary Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, Argentina, Chili and Mexico, to\r\nmention only countries spoken of in the foregoing pages. The Onderdonk\r\nclassification can, of course, be extended to take in these new races,\r\nmost of which are now represented in America, but eventually such a\r\nclassification would become too cumbersome for use. It must not be\r\noverlooked that the Onderdonk classification should be doubled to apply\r\nto the nectarine, the other division of _Prunus persica_, which the\r\npresent classification wholly ignores.\r\n\r\nIf the variations are stable, and all regions represented, the\r\nlikenesses and differences brought about by regional environment may\r\nwell be used by classifiers. But in the Onderdonk classification\r\nunstable variations due to climate are too largely used; as,\r\ndifferences in the succession of life-events, in the rest-period, in\r\nthe capacity to endure heat and drought, and in minor modifications\r\nof organs, as color of foliage and shape of fruit. All of these are\r\nvariations that fluctuate with even slight changes in the climate. We\r\nhave said that this classification, though constantly referred to by\r\nnorthern fruit-growers, is not satisfactory in New York. Professor\r\nPrice, too, found as he went northward that his classificatory scheme\r\nwas less dependable. He says:[188] \"Some of the distinctions made in\r\nthis classification cannot be noticed with decisive clearness a few\r\nhundred miles farther north.\" A further objection to this regional\r\nclassification of Onderdonk is that, in the numerous distinct\r\npeach-regions of America, new regional variations are arising which\r\nmake it impossible to classify in accordance with characters that\r\nappeared before the peach came to America.\r\n\r\nThese \"races\" of Onderdonk and Price, then, by leaving out the\r\npeach-floras of many regions, are too exclusive, but it is no less true\r\nthat they are too inclusive. Thus, the many varieties of the historic\r\npeach of western countries are put by the Onderdonk classification\r\nin the Persian race. So considered, this Persian race contains types\r\nquite as widely separated from each other as are the five \"races\" of\r\nthe Onderdonk classification. In one great group are collected early,\r\nlate, white-fleshed, yellow-fleshed, red-fleshed, globular, oblong,\r\nbeaked, hardy and tender, vigorous and dwarfish peaches. Persian\r\npeaches run the whole gamut of peach-characters, the flatness of the\r\nPeento possibly excepted, and from the several hundred sorts a score of\r\n\"races\" might be made. These peaches are noted by Price and Onderdonk\r\nas requiring a long period of rest and as succeeding only in northern\r\nclimates. Yet to this group belong the peaches of France, Spain and\r\nItaly; those of the warm parts of Africa, South America and Oceanica;\r\nand most of the varieties that thrive at the most northern limits of\r\npeach-growing in Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThe Onderdonk classification, in assigning zones to each of its five\r\nraces, misleads peach-growers as to the hardiness of varieties. It\r\nmakes the Peento and honey-flavored peaches much more tender in tree\r\nthan they are. Varieties of both groups grow as far north as this\r\nStation and Waugh reports that one of the Peento varieties \"was\r\ndiscovered growing thriftily and fruiting nicely on the grounds of the\r\nMassachusetts Agricultural College, Amherst, Massachusetts.\"[189] Of\r\nthe score of descendants of the Honey, several are fruiting well on our\r\ngrounds, four being illustrated and described in _The Peaches of New\r\nYork_. If there were a demand for honey-flavored peaches, climate would\r\nnot prevent their culture in New York.\r\n\r\nThe name used for the Peento group, if it be worth while keeping these\r\npeaches in a group, is inapt. It gives the impression that all, like\r\nPeento, are flat peaches--in fact Price several times so publishes\r\nthem--whereas of the twenty-three sorts described by Hume,[190] though\r\nnearly all are seedlings of Peento, only Peento is flat. We must look\r\nupon the Peento as a peach-monster similar to the cleft peach, _Emperor\r\nof Russia_, the nippled peach, _Teton de Venus_, the _Perseque_ with\r\nits teat-like protuberances, or the more familiar snow-white and\r\nblood-red varieties.\r\n\r\nWe are not able to see where the Peento group leaves off and the\r\nHoney group begins in the Onderdonk classification, though, since\r\nvarieties of the Peentos have not fruited at Geneva and the several\r\nHoney-flavored peaches, though both thrifty in tree and fruitful, are\r\npossibly not typical, we ought not to be too critical. As we read the\r\ndescriptions made by others, however, we are struck by the fact that\r\nthere are more similarities than differences in the two groups and that\r\nthe differences are rapidly disappearing through hybridization.\r\n\r\nBut the obstacle which most effectually blocks the use of Onderdonk's\r\nclassification in the systematic arrangement of peaches is the brood\r\nof hybrid seedling peaches annually brought forth by fruit-growers.\r\nNo doubt the classification is workable, to a degree, with the\r\ntype-varieties and a few carefully selected progeny but after the\r\npractical peach-grower, with a devil-may-care attitude toward\r\nclassification, crosses and recrosses the types, the several races\r\nbecome hopelessly interlocked. The characters chiefly used by\r\nOnderdonk, as has been said, are fluctuating variations and these do\r\nnot descend according to Mendelian laws. And so the great out-pouring\r\nof varieties during the past quarter-century has literally swamped\r\na classification which served only fairly well when it included but\r\nthe pioneer varieties. In the trituration of the thousand and more\r\nvarieties of peaches now going on, the Onderdonk classification will be\r\nless and less useful.\r\n\r\nIn dismissing the Onderdonk scheme as having but limited application\r\nfor classificatory purposes, acknowledgment is made that it serves\r\nother purposes very well. It calls attention to the history of the\r\npeach; it shows that racial strains of the peach are arising; it brings\r\nout valuable information in regard to hardiness and the rest-period of\r\npeaches; it offers instances of modification of the peach by climate;\r\nand it shows the capacity of the peach to vary. For thus illuminating\r\nthe natural history of the peach, more especially the climatology of\r\nthe peach, pomology is much indebted to Onderdonk and Price.\r\n\r\n_A key to varieties of peaches._--A natural classification of peaches\r\nto show the relationships of varieties is seemingly impossible. The\r\ndeluge of new varieties, which growers continue with cheerful optimism\r\nto pour out, overwhelms the classifier with difficulties. About the\r\nbest that can be done is to arrange varieties, for convenience in\r\nidentifying, according to some of the artificial systems of a century\r\nago when the cult of the classifier was at its height. These were\r\nreally synoptical keys rather than biological classifications. If such\r\na key is to be used very generally by fruit-growers, only characters of\r\nthe fruit are admissible, thereby attaining necessary simplicity and\r\nproviding that all data can be had at one examination.\r\n\r\nThe first division of a synoptical key would of course be founded on\r\nthe absence or presence of pubescence on the skin; these two great\r\ndivisions would then be separated into freestones and clingstones;\r\nthese, in turn, divided in accordance to color of flesh--white, yellow,\r\nred; the Peento and honey-flavored peaches make necessary a division\r\nin regard to shape--globular, flat, beaked; a further separation into\r\nearly, medium and late sorts could then be made. A great merit in this\r\nextremely simple classification is that the language of the layman fits\r\nit. As examples: Greensboro would follow the key from bottom to top--an\r\nearly, round, white-fleshed, freestone peach; or Salwey, a late, round,\r\nyellow-fleshed, freestone peach. This key provides for seventy-two\r\ngroups, fifty-four for the peach and eighteen for the nectarine, the\r\nlatter having but the globular form. Other characters, of less general\r\napplication in the key than those so far used, as size, flavor,\r\nadherence or non-adherence of the skin, suture, apex, and stone, could\r\nbe used to carry this classification still further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PEACH-GROWING IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial peach-growing began in America early in the Nineteenth\r\nCentury. About this time, it will be remembered, budded trees began to\r\ntake the place of seedlings. Named varieties appeared as a consequence\r\nof budding and, as nurseries sprang up in the settled parts of the\r\ncountry, varieties multiplied at a rapid rate. After the year 1800 we\r\nread less about peaches as food for hogs and less about peach-products\r\nfor assuaging the thirst for strong drink. As cities and towns built\r\nup, market demands increased and money-making began to quicken the\r\ncharms of peach-growing. With the coming of extensive plantings and\r\nintensive culture in commercial orchards, new and menacing pests and\r\nother problems began to appear at every turn. Before the middle of the\r\ncentury, commercial peach-growing was in full swing in the Chesapeake\r\npeach-belt and in its infancy in several westward regions. Stories\r\nof great success now filled the papers, \"peach kings\" abounded, and,\r\nwith the return of good times following the Civil War, fruit-growers\r\nindulged in a saturnalia of peach-tree planting. The rouge of\r\nspeculation made the industry doubly attractive. An account of the rise\r\nof commercial peach-growing in America cannot help but be of interest\r\nand, besides, it is only by the study of the past of the industry that\r\nwe can draw safe conclusions for the future.\r\n\r\nPeach-growing on a commercial scale in the United States began in\r\nwhat is known as the Peninsula, consisting, technically, of the\r\nEastern Shore of Maryland, Delaware and southern New Jersey but\r\nhorticulturally, because of similitude of soil, climate and products,\r\ntaking in a bit of Virginia, touching eastern Pennsylvania and running\r\nup to Long Island. All of this region, including the southern reaches\r\nof the Hudson, may be considered as one commercial territory. The peach\r\nbegan its undisputed supremacy among fruits in the orchards of the\r\nPeninsula as early as orchards were planted but, beginning with 1800,\r\nthe industry pushed ahead with leaps and bounds so that the figures at\r\ntimes remind one of Alice in Wonderland when she drank from the magic\r\nbottle and immediately grew to gigantic proportions.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 an orchard of 20,000 trees was set in Anne Arundel County,\r\nMaryland, the product to be used in brandy-making.[191] The last\r\npeach-grower to engage in the liquor business seems to have been\r\na certain Mr. Bayley in Accomack County, Virginia, the tip of the\r\nPeninsula, who in 1814 planted 63,000 trees which six years later\r\nyielded fifteen gallons of brandy per 100 trees, worth $2 per\r\ngallon--not profitable unless the seed were sown in rows, as was\r\nprobably the case, and the seedlings permitted to crowd rather\r\nclosely.[192] One of the first large orchards planted in this region\r\nto supply city peach-markets was that of a Mr. Cassidy who set an\r\norchard of 50,000 trees in Cecil County, Maryland, about 1830.[193] The\r\nproduct of this orchard went to market in sailboats and large wagons.\r\nThe industry was not in full swing in this region until the fifties\r\nwhen orchards were planted all along the water courses in Cecil, Kent\r\nand Queen Anne counties, making a continuous forest of peach-trees two\r\nmiles back from the rivers.[194]\r\n\r\nThe peach-industry in Delaware seems to have begun, according to Mr.\r\nCharles Wright,[195] in 1832 at Delaware City, when a twenty-acre\r\norchard of budded trees was set by Messrs. Reeves and Ridgeway, which\r\nby 1836 had increased to 110 acres. The receipts from this orchard\r\nin a single season were as much as $16,000, the fruit bringing in\r\nPhiladelphia from $1.25 to $3 per three-peck basket. Other notable\r\norchards of these early times mentioned by Mr. Wright are those of\r\nMajor Philip Reybold and Sons who, beginning in 1835, by 1846 had\r\n117,720 trees on 1090 acres near Delaware City from which 63,344\r\nbaskets of peaches were shipped in August, 1845; in Kent County, John\r\nReed began planting as early as 1829 and several years later had 10,000\r\ntrees of Red Cheek Melocotons. In 1848 the peach-crop in Delaware\r\nwas estimated at 5,000,000 baskets, chiefly from New Castle County.\r\nPeach-yellows, first a serious pest around Philadelphia about 1800,\r\nbecame epidemic in northern Delaware in 1842 and, little by little, the\r\ncenter of the peach-industry shifted southward from Middletown in the\r\nlate sixties to Smyrna; a few years later it had reached Wyoming and in\r\nthe nineties it was as far south as Bridgeville.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to follow the ups and downs of the peach-industry\r\nin the Peninsula. Epidemics of yellows, a succession of cold winters,\r\nover-production, transportation difficulties or expense, San Jose\r\nscale, have all been factors powerful enough at various times to make\r\nor mar the fortunes of those engaged in growing peaches. Indeed, in\r\nfollowing the history of this fruit on the Peninsula, one is forced\r\nto declare that peach-growing is gambling pure and simple. Take, for\r\nexample, the building of the Delaware railroad. Peaches were scarcely\r\nplanted in the interior parts of the Peninsula, away from water-ways,\r\nuntil the building of this road in the sixties and seventies, when\r\nthe yield increased so rapidly that 4,175,500 baskets were shipped by\r\nrail in 1875, the total yield being 8,782,716 baskets[196]--fortunes\r\nfollowed the completion of the railroad only to be lost in subsequent\r\nover-production.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and southeastern New York rather\r\nslowly followed the lead of Delaware in commercial peach-growing.\r\nNew Jersey, according to census reports, reached her zenith in\r\npeach-growing in 1899 when there were 4,413,568 peach-trees in the\r\nState which produced 2,746,607 bushels of fruit giving her third rank\r\namong the states of the Union in production. Ten years later the State\r\nhad dropped to fourteenth. The peach seems to have been neglected in\r\neastern Pennsylvania as a commercial crop, possibly because a good\r\nstart was never made on account of the early appearance of yellows. In\r\nsoutheastern New York and on Long Island, peach-growers have usually\r\nfollowed the fortunes of their neighbors in New Jersey who have ever\r\ngrown on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nTo show how quickly the peach gives returns and how great the return\r\nfrom the capital invested, the following figures, savoring a good deal\r\nof American boastfulness of dollars and cents, are illustrative:[197]\r\n\"The peach farms in Upper Delaware and Maryland have returned to their\r\nowners the most fabulous amounts for their investments far exceeding in\r\nprofit any other staple crop that has been raised in the Middle States,\r\nand on a scale never before heard of in this or any other country. Some\r\nof the orchards containing from 1000 to 1300 acres have netted their\r\nowners from $20,000 to $30,000 annually. A peach orchard in New Castle\r\ncounty, Delaware, of 400 acres, netted the owner in one crop, $38,000.\r\nOne in Kent county, Maryland, of some 600 acres, produced a crop paying\r\n$31,000, and the same orchard in 1879 yielded $42,000. In 1873, the\r\nDelaware Peach Growers' Association reported that there were sent\r\nfrom the Delaware peninsula to the northern markets of Philadelphia\r\nand New York 1,288,500 baskets of peaches, or 2577 car-loads by the\r\nrailroad. Adding the quantity shipped by steamers and sailing vessels,\r\nand the amount canned, the actual quantity amounted, in the aggregate,\r\nto 2,000,000 of baskets. In 1872, the whole district, comprising the\r\nEastern Shore of Maryland, marketed 3,500,000 baskets. The late Col.\r\nWilkins, on Chester river, Kent county, Maryland, had 1350 acres in\r\nwith peach trees, numbering 137,000, producing in bearing years from\r\n$30,000 to $40,000 annually.\"\r\n\r\nCommercial peach-growing in the South is of recent development--its\r\nhistory is known to all pomologists of the present generation. It\r\nbegan in the seventies, the impetus being given by the introduction of\r\na number of early, bright-colored, very showy peaches that could be\r\nmarketed in northern cities in May and June. It took years, however,\r\nto develop means to send these peaches to market and it was not until\r\nin the nineties that the perfection of refrigerator cars and rapid\r\ntransportation was such that the southern crop cut any figure in the\r\npeach-markets. The introduction of the Elberta in the seventies may\r\nbe said to be another stone in the foundation of the peach-industry\r\nin the South. After Georgia became a factor in the culture of this\r\nfruit in America in the nineties, the State was followed in lesser\r\ndegree, by South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas.\r\nIn most of these southern states the peach-orchard is so near the\r\ncotton-plantation--often the two are interplanted--that the owners rob\r\nPeter to pay Paul in the care of the two crops. But this is not always\r\nthe case, and at its best the southern peach-orchard is the consummate\r\nflower of modern commercial peach-growing.\r\n\r\nThe peach-industry in Connecticut is a recent development, as in\r\nthe South. As late as 1880 the crop was negligible in the State; in\r\n1889, 37,295 bushels were grown; 61,775 in 1899; and 417,918 bushels\r\nin 1909. This, considering the smallness of the State and the very\r\nuneven surface of much of it, is a rather remarkable development.\r\nWinter-killing, which takes place about one winter out of four, is\r\nthe chief drawback but the high prices received from nearby markets\r\nmake the peach, despite the occasional off-year, a profitable crop.\r\nConnecticut peaches are characterized by large size, bright color\r\nand good quality. From Connecticut the industry has spread into\r\nMassachusetts where all conditions are essentially the same.\r\n\r\nPeach-growing in New York has never been spectacular. Along the lower\r\nHudson before the Civil War and again a decade after it there was a\r\nthriving peach-industry such as there was in New Jersey and Delaware. A\r\npeach-industry is first of all dependent on quick transportation--the\r\nfruit must move. This meant in early days that there must be nearby\r\nmarkets and water transportation--western New York had the latter\r\nbut not the former. Peaches, however, were early grown, in fact, as\r\nwe have seen, were cultivated by the Indians, in the lake regions\r\nof western New York. In 1828 the Domestic Horticultural Society, the\r\nthird such organization in America, was organized in Geneva, having\r\nfor its field ten counties in western New York.[198] The Monroe County\r\nHorticultural Society was organized in 1830,[199] and in 1831 the\r\n_Genesee Farmer and Gardener's Journal_ came into existence. These\r\ninstitutions bore fruit, more literally bore orchards, and a taste for\r\nhorticulture, which, together with the nurseries that by this time\r\nwere being established in the salubrious climate and excellent soil of\r\nwestern New York, gave a perfection in fruit-growing long unrivalled in\r\nAmerica and now equalled only in California.\r\n\r\nOf the history of commercial peach-growing in western New York, it\r\ncan only be said that there has been such an industry since 1800.\r\nThe product of the orchards of the first quarter-century went, for\r\nmost part, to the brandy-still, for the second quarter it was used at\r\nhome and for local markets and from then on, since 1850, or a little\r\nbefore, the region has been well to the front in the peach-markets of\r\neastern United States. Changes in the commerce of the continent have\r\nmade great changes in the peach-industry in New York. In 1825 the\r\nopening of the Erie Canal made western New York the granary of eastern\r\nUnited States--wheat was more profitable than peaches. Twenty-five\r\nyears later millions of bushels of wheat from the plains, carried\r\nthrough the Great Lakes and the Erie Canal to the sea, began to drive\r\nwheat out of western New York and make the peach more profitable. This\r\nis a fine illustration of the fact that transportation is often as\r\nimportant a factor as soil or climate in the profitable production of\r\na crop. Until figures were taken by census enumerators, the history of\r\nthe peach-industry could be written only by giving innumerable items\r\ntaken at random from newspapers of the times. The present status of\r\npeach-growing in this region is to be discussed in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nAnother large commercial peach-region is to be found along the shore\r\nof Lake Erie in Ohio. The peach has been cultivated very generally in\r\nOhio since the first settlements there more than a century ago and the\r\nindustry assumed commercial importance in a dozen or more centers as\r\nearly, at least, as 1867, when the assessors' returns showed a total\r\ncrop for the State of 1,402,849 bushels.[200] But what is now known\r\nas the peach-belt along the shores of Lake Erie is largely a growth\r\nof comparatively recent times, much of the land now covered with\r\npeach-orchards having been originally planted to vineyards. Possibly\r\nthe region was at its zenith in the nineties, the plantings here\r\ncontributing greatly to putting Ohio in third place at this time among\r\nthe states of the Union in the production of peaches.\r\n\r\nMichigan furnishes an interesting chapter in the history of the\r\npeach-industry. The industry was started in what is now the Michigan\r\npeach-belt by an Indian trader who planted a pit in 1775 near St.\r\nJoseph. From this tree sprang seedling orchards, one of which, near\r\nDouglas at the mouth of the Kalamazoo River, numbered 300 trees. There\r\nwere no budded trees until 1834. A conjunction of several factors\r\nnow gave peach-growing a tremendous impetus in the State. Chicago,\r\ngrowing with leaps and bounds, demanded peaches; the soil and climate\r\nof western Michigan were found to be ideal for this fruit; between\r\nthe supply and demand was quick and cheap transportation by water.\r\nShipments began in 1834 to Chicago and, as this and other western\r\ncities grew, peach-planting in Michigan progressed as probably never\r\nbefore in any other part of the world. In the seventies peach-yellows\r\nswept like a wave of fire over the southern portion of what is now\r\nthe belt, driving the industry northward until at Traverse City the\r\npeach reached its highest northern limit in the eastern states. With\r\nbetter control of the yellows, peach-orchards were again planted in the\r\nsouthern parts of the belt and the industry continues to thrive, though\r\nwith the ups and downs incident to this fruit wherever grown.\r\n\r\nAnother large peach-growing area lies in southern Illinois extending\r\nacross the Mississippi into Missouri and Kansas. Westward, in Colorado,\r\nUtah, California, Oregon and Washington, are the world's newest\r\npeach-orchards, all of which have arisen to commercial importance\r\nwithin recent times. In southern Illinois and Missouri, however, even\r\nbefore the Civil War, peach-growing had assumed sufficient magnitude to\r\nbe called an industry. The present standing of these later peach-areas\r\nmay best be compared with that of the older regions by a tabulated\r\nreport from the United States Census Reports which is herewith printed.\r\nIn the fluctuating figures of this table one sees the exploitation of\r\nthe peach. What other tree-crop in the whole world could show more ups\r\nand downs in the brief space of thirty years? No state holds first rank\r\ntwo decades in succession; in fifteen states in 1910 there were more\r\ntrees not of bearing age than there were in bearing; there were more\r\npeach-trees in the United States in 1900 than in 1910; the figures\r\nmost graphically attest the shifting of peach-regions; decreasing\r\nnumbers represent misfortunes--most often yellows, or San Jose scale,\r\na freeze, or overproduction; increasing numbers stand for a newly\r\ndiscovered advantage. By these tokens we better realize the speculative\r\nnature of peach-growing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACH-PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES, 1890-1910\r\n\r\n

=======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW TYPES OF PEACHES\r\n\r\nThe capacity of species to split into types, using types in a broad\r\nsense, is, we all agree, one of the greatest assets of cultivated\r\nplants. Through diversity of types come adaptabilities to soils\r\nand climates and variety in the crop, to mention but two of the\r\nessentials of standard crop-plants. New types afford the material from\r\nwhich greatest progress comes in fruit-growing. In common with all\r\nfruit-growing, peach-growing has received impetus from time to time\r\nfrom the introduction of new and distinct types. In the middle of the\r\nNineteenth Century, three previously unknown types of peaches, each\r\ndivisible into horticultural varieties, were brought to America. All\r\nthree have had important effects on the peach-industry in America.\r\n\r\n_North China peaches._--Not very distinct from the Persian peaches at\r\nthe outset, its outliers running into some of the other groups as well,\r\n\"North China\" is now but little more than a name for a conglomerate\r\nlot of varieties grown everywhere in America except in the sub-tropic\r\nparts of the Gulf States. The North China race includes varieties\r\ncharacterized by fruits of large size, great beauty, tender skin\r\nand flesh, good quality and vigorous trees which bear abundantly\r\nand regularly. The group has received careful study at the Delaware\r\nExperiment Station, an account of it by G. Harold Powell having been\r\npublished in the Thirteenth Annual Report from that Station in 1901.\r\nPowell prefers to call the group Chinese Cling rather than North China.\r\n\r\nThe peaches put in the North China group are so nearly akin to those\r\nin the Persian group that it is difficult to place varieties. All\r\nagree, however, in taking the European Shanghai, the American Chinese\r\nCling, as the type-variety and, though it is probable that travelers\r\nor missionaries brought pits of some of these peaches from northern\r\nChina a century or more ago, the known history of the group begins\r\nwith the variety just named as the type. It is a pleasure to give\r\nRobert Fortune, the indefatigable collector of Chinese plants for the\r\nLondon Horticultural Society, credit for introducing these peaches into\r\nwestern countries. In 1844 Fortune collected a fine, large, delicious\r\npeach near Shanghai and in the autumn forwarded pits and a plant in a\r\npot to London. The pits were sown and the seedlings produced fruit in\r\n1852 and from among these a sort was selected and called Shanghai.[201]\r\nPits from this first collection were probably sent to France, for the\r\nname appears in the early fifties in the pomological literature of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe first American reference to the Shanghai is found in 1851[202]\r\nwhen fruits were exhibited at the Massachusetts Horticultural Society\r\nin Boston by R. Choate with the statement \"peach from a tree imported\r\nfrom Shanghai.\" More definite are the facts of an importation made by\r\nCharles Downing in 1850. Early in that year Downing received potted\r\npeach-trees from the British consul at Shanghai under the names\r\n\"Chinese Cling\" and \"Shanghai,\" supposed to be two sorts but proving to\r\nbe identical. One of these trees was sent to Mr. Henry Lyons, Columbia,\r\nSouth Carolina, and this bore fruit in 1851.[203] From Downing's stock\r\nthe variety was quickly and widely distributed and the horticultural\r\nmagazines of the time gave the new peaches wide publicity, so that,\r\nfrom this and other importations which were made from time to time by\r\nvarious persons, these peaches from northern China were universally\r\ngrown in the peach-orchards of America within a quarter of a century of\r\ntheir introduction.\r\n\r\n_South China peaches._--Those who have read the descriptions of\r\nChinese peaches in Chapter 1 (pages 14 to 21) recognize at once the\r\nbeaked varieties of South China, especially those growing about\r\nCanton. These peaches, common enough in China and cultivated there\r\nfor centuries, reached occidental countries only in the middle of\r\nthe Nineteenth Century. They came to America as seeds from Dr. J. T.\r\nDevan, Canton, China, to Mr. John Caldwell, Newburg, New York,[204]\r\nand were introduced into Europe probably by M. Montigny, French Consul\r\nat Shanghai, who sent seeds to the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, in\r\n1852.[205] In recent years a number of fresh importations of seeds and\r\nplants of these honey-flavored, beaked peaches have been made by the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nA composite picture of South China peaches shows the following\r\ncharacters:\r\n\r\nTree of medium size, upright-spreading; branches leaving the trunk\r\nat an angle of about fifty degrees and curving upward; buds quite\r\nprominent; flowers always large and very abundant, pale pink, base\r\nof petals darker pink; leaves small, long, narrow, pointed, finely\r\nserrate, conduplicate, distributed all along the limb, dark green,\r\nin fall slightly tinged with red. Fruit small, oval, yellow or white\r\nblushed with red, slightly flattened; skin adhering to the flesh;\r\nsuture very deep in basin, but does not extend more than one-third\r\nthe way down; apex long and recurved; flesh white or yellow; flavor\r\na peculiar honey-sweet; stone free or cling, long-pointed, generally\r\ncurved.\r\n\r\nAs yet these honey-flavored peaches are grown commercially only in the\r\nGulf States, the notion prevailing that they cannot be grown in the\r\nNorth. Quite to the contrary they do exceedingly well as far north as\r\nGeneva, though undesirable because of smallness of fruit and lateness\r\nin ripening. Of the score of the descendants of the original Honey,\r\nseveral are in bearing on the Station grounds, Climax, Imperial, Pallas\r\nand Triana being illustrated in _The Peaches of New York_. All but two\r\nor three of the varieties that are put in this group originated in\r\nFlorida and most of them come from the grounds of G. L. Taber, Glen\r\nSaint Mary, of that State. An excellent bulletin, No. 73, from the\r\nFlorida Agricultural Experiment Station, published in 1904, by F. C.\r\nReimer, gives a full account of these peaches.\r\n\r\nIs the beaked character permanent? That regions in time give rise to\r\nracial strains must have occurred to all who have read the preceding\r\npages. The peach acquires distinct varietal characters in every\r\ngreat geographical region in which it is grown. Possibly in no other\r\ncharacter is the change greater than in the long, pointed, erect or\r\nrecurved apex in common parlance called the beak. As a rule, the\r\nfarther south the more pronounced is the beak and the more oblong is\r\nthe fruit. In this respect, southern peaches, taking them as a whole,\r\nare as markedly different from New York peaches as are the long,\r\ncrowned, angular-topped apples of the Pacific Northwest from the rotund\r\nfruits of the Atlantic Northeast. The four sorts of honey-flavored\r\npeaches described and illustrated in _The Peaches of New York_, named\r\nin the foregoing paragraph, illustrate this well, none of them being\r\nnearly so abruptly conical as specimens coming to us from the South.\r\nPeaches in China, evidently, show the same modification, for those\r\ndiscussed in the previous group are as markedly rotund as those in\r\nthis group are conic and beaked. It is a fair inference, then, that\r\nthe beaked character of the peach, counting time in generations of the\r\ntree, is permanent only in southern climates.\r\n\r\n_Peento peaches._--Another group of these Chinese peaches, not very\r\ndifferent from the South China varieties we have just given an account\r\nof, is composed of the score or more sorts showing relationship to the\r\nvariety, Peento. These may be rather indefinitely described as follows:\r\n\r\nTree large, vigorous, upright-spreading; branches willow-like,\r\nbranching at an angle of about forty degrees; flowers large, pink,\r\nopening early, often at a low temperature and very irregularly; leaves\r\nnarrow, long, finely serrated, with reniform glands; inclined to be\r\nevergreen; fruit sub-globose except in Peento which is flattened\r\nendwise; skin white and mottled with carmine, parting readily from the\r\nflesh; flesh white or yellow; flavor sweet, with a peculiar almond\r\ntaste; stone occasionally flattened endwise, either free or cling.\r\nThis race is adapted to sub-tropical parts of the Gulf States where it\r\nripens from May 1st to June 1st.\r\n\r\nThe Peento, which gives name to this group, is without doubt a\r\ndescendant of the flat peaches of China, common enough as we have\r\nseen. The first tree, however, came from Java to England where it was\r\nfirst grown by John Braddick under the name Java peach.[206] William\r\nPrince,[207] Flushing, Long Island, imported the variety to America\r\nsome time previous to 1828 and grew it to the number of twenty trees.\r\nThe peaches from Prince's importation seem to have been lost and\r\nthe variety did not appear again in America until 1869 when P. J.\r\nBerckmans,[208] Augusta, Georgia, brought seed from China, from one\r\nof which came the Peento. Peento peaches in America are peculiar to\r\nFlorida, where all of the score or more varieties but the Peento have\r\noriginated. This group of peaches has been well described by H. Harold\r\nHume in Bulletin 62 of the Florida Experiment Station from which the\r\ndescription given above is an adaptation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] De Candolle, Alphonse _Or. Cult.

There are some whose flesh is white, some greenish,\r\nsome a delicate yellow, some a yellow orange and some marble; some\r\nare round, some oval, some lengthened to a point like a crow's beak.\r\nPeaches are heard of weighing two pounds or even more. The largest\r\nones I have seen were scarcely three and a half inches in length and\r\ndiameter; as to earliness, in the middle provinces there are peaches\r\nalmost as soon as cherries. It is still more astonishing that some\r\nvarieties do not ripen here till October, and that there is a secret by\r\nwhich they can be kept till January, just as fresh, just as beautiful,\r\nand just as delicious as if right off the tree.\"\r\n\r\n[68] Ikeda, T. _The Fruit Culture in Japan_ 32, 33. 1907.\r\n\r\n[69] Loureiro, _Fl.

I\r\ntranslate _xocotl_ \"plum\", because the Mexicans applied this word to\r\nmany plum-like fruits, or fruits more or less acid in distinction to\r\n_tzapotl_, the general term applied to sweet soft fruits. The words\r\ncited are all hybrid compounds of Nahuatl and Spanish.

He landed in 1748 and spent\r\nthe next three years in travel in the settled parts of the New World\r\ndevoting himself to the study of the plant and animal life, the natural\r\nphenomena, resources and agriculture of the Middle and Northern States\r\nand Canada. On his return to Sweden, Kalm published an account of his\r\ntravels in America which was afterward translated into German and then\r\ninto English. To him we are indebted for much valuable information in\r\nregard to the beginnings of agriculture and horticulture in the middle\r\nof the Eighteenth Century in America.

Y.\r\n\r\n[129] David Thomas is now scarcely known in horticulture except as\r\nhe is spoken of as the father of America's well-known agricultural,\r\nhorticultural and pomological writer, John Jacob Thomas. Yet the father\r\nmerits recognition for his work in agriculture and horticulture. David\r\nThomas was a Quaker, born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in 1776.\r\nHe became a civil engineer and moved to Aurora, Cayuga County, New\r\nYork, in 1805 and began to practice his profession. Later he became\r\none of the engineers in charge of the construction of the Erie Canal\r\nand still later performed a similar service in building the Welland\r\nCanal. Soon after, we find him a nurseryman and fruit-grower at\r\nAurora. Throughout his entire life, his son writes, he was interested\r\nin horticulture, pomology and botany and by his writings on these\r\nsubjects, published principally in the _Genesee Farmer_, then the\r\nleading agricultural paper in western New York, and in _Travels in\r\nthe Western Country in 1816_, published in Auburn in 1819, David\r\nThomas performed most valuable services in forwarding the cultivation\r\nof fruits. He was a corresponding member of the London Horticultural\r\nSociety and of the Linnaean Society of Paris. His articles in the\r\n_Genesee Farmer_ and other agricultural papers furnish the most\r\nauthoritative statements we have in regard to the early history of\r\nfruit-growing in western New York. The name of David Thomas ought long\r\nto be preserved by horticulturists of the State and country together\r\nwith that of his illustrious son, John Jacob Thomas.\r\n\r\n[130] _Mass.

His nursery was\r\nsituated in the towns of Newton and Brighton, Massachusetts, and was\r\nfounded in 1790. As we have stated in the text, he early acquired\r\nthe art of budding and possibly was the first, or at least one of\r\nthe first, nurserymen to offer budded peach-trees for sale. In 1823,\r\nhe advertised in the _New England Farmer_ thirty varieties of budded\r\npeaches five to eight feet high at thirty-three and one-third cents\r\neach. These thirty varieties must have included practically all of\r\nthe named sorts then grown in America. It is interesting to note\r\nthat he states in the advertisement that the trees were packed with\r\nclay and mats. It was in this year that William Kenrick, son of John\r\nKenrick, became a partner of his father. Beside growing peaches, the\r\nKenrick nurseries offered for sale other trees, vine and bush-fruits\r\nand ornamentals as well. The Kenricks were also extensive growers of\r\ncurrants from which they made currant-wine, their output in 1824 being\r\n1700 gallons; in 1825, 3000 gallons and in 1826, 3600 gallons. The date\r\nand place of John Kenrick's birth cannot be learned. His death occurred\r\nin 1833 in the Kenrick mansion, built in 1720, standing near the\r\nnurseries. New England, and peach-growers everywhere, owe him a debt of\r\ngratitude for his services in horticulture.\r\n\r\n[138] William Kenrick, son of John, of whom we have just written, was\r\nborn in 1795 in the family mansion on Nonantum Hill in the town of\r\nNewton, Massachusetts. He was trained by his father as a nurseryman\r\nand in 1823 became a partner in the Kenrick nurseries, of which he\r\nsoon after appears to have assumed control. The Kenrick nurseries,\r\nat this time, were probably the most extensive and the best known of\r\nany in New England. Besides growing the fruit-bearing plants of the\r\ntime and such ornamentals as were then to be found in America, the\r\nKenricks seem to have taken an enthusiastic part in the craze for the\r\nLombardy Poplar which was then raging in America. The elder Kenrick\r\nmust have been one of the early growers of this popular plant for in\r\n1797 two acres of his nursery was appropriated to the Lombardy Poplar.\r\nThe son, in his turn an enthusiast, succumbed to the silk-culture\r\nfad and seems in 1835 to have been one of the leading growers of the\r\nmulberry, _Morus multicaulus_ for feeding silkworms. In this year\r\nMr. Kenrick published the _American Silk Growers Guide_, which is,\r\nin essence, a treatise on mulberry-culture. William Kenrick's most\r\nnotable pomological achievement, however, was the publication of the\r\n_New American Orchardist_ which appeared in 1833. While not the best\r\nof the pomological manuals of the time, it is a valuable contribution\r\nto American pomology because of its full descriptions of the fruits of\r\nthat date. Beginning with his father in 1823, William Kenrick continued\r\nin the nursery business for twenty-seven years, probably growing,\r\nimporting and disposing of more fruit and ornamental trees than any\r\nother nurseryman in New England during this time.

His grandfather,\r\na French Huguenot, was the founder of the establishment of which he\r\nbecame owner, and in which he made his reputation. Under his father,\r\nthe first William Prince, the nursery at Flushing developed into a\r\ngreat commercial nursery, a private experiment station, a testing\r\nground for American and foreign fruits and a botanic garden of American\r\nplants. The mantle dropped by William Prince, the father, at his\r\ndeath in 1802, fell upon the shoulders of William Prince, subject of\r\nthis sketch, then just reaching the prime of life and one of the most\r\nbrilliant and versatile pomologists the country has known. William\r\nPrince continued most successfully the work of his father in breeding\r\nnew varieties, domesticating native plants and importing foreign fruits\r\nand ornamentals. During his supervision the Prince Nursery reached\r\nthe height of its fame. It was conducted less for money than for love\r\nof the work. An attempt was made to grow every American and European\r\nplant-species having horticultural value. The catalogs published from\r\nthe nursery by William Prince are among the best horticultural and\r\nbotanical contributions of the first half of the Nineteenth Century.\r\nBesides these, William Prince is the author of the _Treatise on\r\nHorticulture_, published in 1828, and gave assistance to his son,\r\nWilliam Robert Prince, in preparing his _Pomological Manual_ published\r\nin 1832. In the description of varieties in this text it will be found\r\nthat many varieties of peaches were originated, introduced, imported or\r\nfirst described by William Prince.\r\n\r\n[208] For a brief history of the life and horticultural activities of\r\nProsper Julius A. Berckmans, the reader is referred to _The Plums of\r\nNew York_, page 159.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACH-PRODUCTS\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the peach-industry in the United States is better\r\nappreciated if figures showing values are given. The value of peaches\r\nand nectarines in 1909, for the United States, was $28,781,078, an\r\namount surpassed by only one other fruit, the apple. The highest value\r\nfor a geographical division is reported for the East North-Central\r\nStates, the amount being $5,173,000, followed by the South Atlantic\r\nStates with $4,888,000 and the Pacific States with $4,887,000. Of\r\nindividual states, California with her enormous area, over most\r\nof which the peach thrives, ranks first, the value of the crop in\r\n1909 reaching $4,574,000; the next most important State is Georgia,\r\n$2,183,000; the third, New York, $2,014,000; these followed in order\r\nof value by Michigan, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri,\r\nKentucky, Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina, each with a crop of\r\nmore than $1,000,000 in value.\r\n\r\nThe peach has greater commercial value in the United States than all\r\nother stone-fruits combined, the value of the crop in 1909, as we\r\nhave seen, amounting to $28,781,078 while the value of the plum was\r\n$10,299,495; of the cherry, $7,231,160; of the apricot, $2,884,119; of\r\nthe almond, $712,000. The consumption of peaches is increasing year by\r\nyear. Until recently the peach has been considered a fruit of luxury,\r\nbut large plantations, good care, quick and safe transportation and\r\nwide distribution now provide peaches for all who can afford to eat\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe profits of peach-growing are occasionally so enormous that the\r\npublication of the figures is usually followed by excessive planting,\r\nwith consequent over-production and low prices, followed, in turn, by\r\nscarcity and high prices. So, too, the peach is more at the mercy of\r\nthe seasons than any other standard tree-fruit and winter freezes and\r\nspring frosts ruin crops in some part of the country every year and\r\noften such disasters are widespread. These ups and downs, however,\r\ninstead of decreasing, seem to stimulate the peach-trade, probably, on\r\nthe part of the grower, because gambling is a universal vice; on the\r\npart of the consumer, because he better appreciates peaches when the\r\nblessing is occasionally withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe chosen use for any choice fruit is to eat it as it comes from the\r\ntree or as prepared fresh fruit for dessert. So the peach is chiefly\r\nused the world over. Refreshing and delectable as any other fruit,\r\nit has another quality, appreciated by those who sell as well as by\r\nthose who consume--it does not cloy the appetite. The insatiable\r\nlonging of the great lexicographer, Johnson, for peaches is common to\r\nall lovers of this fruit. Boswell, Johnson's biographer, gives this\r\ngustatory reminiscence of his famous patron: \"He would eat seven or\r\neight large peaches of a morning before breakfast began, and treated\r\nthem with proportionate attention after dinner again, yet I have heard\r\nhim protest that he never had quite as much as he wished, except once,\r\nin his life.\" In America the greater part of the crop is, no doubt,\r\neaten out of hand but peach-pie and peaches and cream, and peach-butter\r\nare national dishes, while marmalades, jellies, pickles, preserves\r\nand sauces are as common to this fruit as to any other. Besides the\r\ninnumerable cooked products, several refreshing domestic drinks are\r\nmade from the juice of peaches, as shrub and peach-wine, or it may be\r\nfrozen into sherbet or ice cream. Waste peaches are used with more or\r\nless success as stock for vinegar. Peaches are canned and evaporated in\r\nthe United States on an enormous scale, nearly one-half the crop being\r\nso utilized.\r\n\r\n_Canned peaches._--Canning is conservation _in excelsis_. It is modern\r\ncompliance to the command, \"Gather up the fragments that remain,\r\nthat nothing be lost.\" Without this method of preserving crops the\r\ncommercial culture of fruits and vegetables as carried on nowadays\r\nwould be ruined and no fruit would suffer as would the peach, since\r\nit leads all others in quantity and value of the canned pack. The\r\nvalue of canned peaches in the United States in 1909 was $3,753,698\r\nor nearly one-seventh the total value of the crop and one may roughly\r\nestimate the fruit canned at home to be half as much as that canned\r\nin the factories. The product was put up in states, named in order\r\nof value of the pack as follows: California, $3,013,203; Michigan,\r\n$175,386; Maryland, $158,839; Georgia, $156,282; New York, $141,142.\r\nThese canned peaches go to every part of the world to which they can\r\nbe cheaply carried and are fit for consumption any time within two or\r\nthree years after being put up. The canning factory has revolutionized\r\nthe peach-industry in the United States by giving its products access\r\nto the world-market.\r\n\r\nCommercial canning is a specialist's business into which we cannot go.\r\nThe processes, essentially, are the same as those used in domestic\r\ncanning and consist in destroying all bacteria by heat and then\r\nhermetically sealing the product in cans. In canning factories the\r\nwork is nearly all done by machinery, including peeling, pitting\r\nand cutting the fruit, soldering the cans and putting on labels.\r\nTo purchase proper machinery, hire labor and manage both to secure\r\nuniformity and cheapness in the product requires large capital and\r\nkeen business ability. Peaches are easy to handle in factories and\r\nthe work can be done so cheaply and the product is so acceptable that\r\nthe factory-canned fruit is rapidly taking the place of that which a\r\nquarter of a century ago was almost wholly put up in the kitchen. The\r\ncanning industry originated, has been perfected and is now chiefly\r\ncarried on in the United States and Canada, though rapidly being\r\nintroduced elsewhere. The aid afforded the peach-grower in this country\r\nby the canneries has been a great stimulus and makes the possibilities\r\nof profitable production of this fruit in the future certain.\r\n\r\nOrchard-canning on a small scale seldom proves feasible, succeeding\r\nbest, if at all, in a home industry to provide a special product for a\r\nfancy or private trade. Occasionally, associations can command capital\r\nenough to compete with the large business enterprises but as a rule\r\nthe peach-grower's interests are served best by the production of\r\nacceptable fruit for those who are engaged in the canning industry.\r\n\r\nIn the East, New York for example, all surplus peaches of standard\r\nvarieties go to the cannery, though certain sorts have preference, but\r\non the Pacific Coast where peaches are grown for canning, the trade\r\ndemands a special type. The choice of varieties differs in different\r\nlocalities so that a prescription of sorts to grow for the canning\r\ntrade cannot be made. Canners accept only yellow-fleshed peaches and\r\nusually prefer clingstones since these stand up better in the can. This\r\npreference is well shown in figures from California, where in 1913\r\nonly 583,800 cases, 24 cans to the case, of freestones were canned as\r\nagainst 1,630,255 cases of clingstones. Fashion now demands varieties\r\nred at the pit. Most cans in the great pack coming from California are\r\nlabeled \"Lemon Cling,\" but this is really now but a trade name, the old\r\nLemon Cling, the pioneer sort in the canning trade, being little grown,\r\na dozen or more similar but improved peaches having taken its place.\r\nThe nectarine is canned in California but is not yet popular with\r\nconsumers despite the fact that the product is most appetizing and very\r\npleasing in appearance. Its smooth skin makes it one of the easiest of\r\nall fruits to can.\r\n\r\n_Evaporated peaches._--In regions distant from the markets evaporation\r\nis an even richer resource of the peach-grower than canning. Thus, in\r\nCalifornia in 1909, the value of the peaches canned was $3,013,203\r\nwhile the dried product was valued at $2,333,137. The figures are\r\ngreater for canned peaches, but be it remembered that the canners'\r\nprofits and the cost of the cans must be deducted, whereas evaporated\r\npeaches are almost wholly a home product, the grower receiving all of\r\nthe proceeds. The dried product is pure peach, almost devoid of water.\r\nPeaches may be cured as dry as a bone and as hard as wood so that the\r\nproduct will keep indefinitely in the temperate zone, and in this\r\nsuper-dried state is shipped to the tropics. The apple is evaporated in\r\nlarge quantities but is a by-product while the cured peach is usually\r\na primary product--a difference worth noting, for, with the apple, the\r\ncream of the crop goes to the fresh fruit-market while the cured peach\r\nis of the same grade as the dessert and canned fruit.\r\n\r\nThe dried-peach industry thrives only in regions, as California, where\r\nthe summers are sunny and rainless. The product is shipped so cheaply\r\nthat peach-growers in cloudy and humid climates, as in New York,\r\ncannot use artificial heat in evaporators and compete with the cured\r\npeaches from the Pacific Slope. In times past when communities were\r\nmore dependent on local resources, the farmer living almost wholly off\r\nof his farm, peaches were cured in humid America though the product,\r\nin appearance at least, was much inferior to that from regions having\r\nfavorable conditions for the evaporation of fruit. New York can hardly\r\nhope to compete with California in curing peaches but two factors make\r\nit barely possible that this State might make a minor industry out of\r\ncuring peaches. The factors are the enormous production of peaches\r\nin the State, over-production being frequent, and the existence of a\r\ngreat number of apple-evaporators which might be utilized in curing the\r\nearlier ripening peaches. It seems worth while, therefore, to go rather\r\nfully into the details of curing peaches as practiced in California\r\nwith the hope that their methods may be modified for use in New York\r\nevaporators. The subjoined footnote gives the best account we are able\r\nto find of the dried-fruit industry in California and of curing peaches\r\nin particular.[209]\r\n\r\nThe most obvious change which takes place in curing peaches is the\r\nloss of water but several other important changes occur which even\r\nmore materially alter the flavor of the product. According to C. F.\r\nLangworthy[210], Chief of the Office of Home Economics, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, the carbohydrates which make up the largest\r\npart of the solid matter of fruits undergo greatest changes. The crude\r\nfibre, too, is reduced in amount or softened. Much of the starch is\r\nchanged into some form of sugar and the less soluble sugar may be\r\nreduced to a more soluble form. Some of the volatile oils and other\r\nethereal bodies, so important in giving flavor to fruits, pass off\r\nor are modified by the curing processes. These changes insure longer\r\nkeeping in the product, give it greater food value than fresh fruit,\r\npound for pound, leaving it quite as digestible, but not as refreshing\r\nand palatable.\r\n\r\nPeach-leather was a common dried peach-product in the old domestic\r\nepoch before the coming of railroads, steamboats and the establishment\r\nof canning and drying industries. Though not now common, peach-leather\r\nis still made in many communities in the East, more particularly in the\r\nsoutheastern states. The peaches are peeled, pitted and then mashed\r\ninto a thin layer which is dried in the sun or an oven, the resulting\r\nproduct taking on the appearance of leather. Peach-leather is said to\r\nkeep indefinitely, this being its chief merit.\r\n\r\nPeach-brandy is still a commercial product of considerable importance\r\nthough the amount made nowadays, as compared with that made a hundred\r\nyears ago before prohibition began to be preached, is but a drop in the\r\nbucket when the number of bushels raised is considered. According to\r\nthe Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[211] the quantity of peach-brandy\r\nmade in 1908, the last year reported, was 13,649.5 gallons, most of\r\nwhich came from California. Peach-brandy is made by converting the\r\nsugar of the fruit into alcohol and then distilling. The finished\r\nliquor contains about 50 per ct. alcohol. In European countries,\r\npeach-kernels are much used in flavoring a liquor called Eau de Noyau.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bulletin 133, Bureau of Plant Industry, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, valuable fixed and volatile oils can be\r\nproduced from the kernel of the peach. Peach-stones are now burned as\r\nfuel by most canneries, excepting small quantities sold to nurseries\r\nfor propagation. The possibility of producing oils from the kernels\r\nseems well worth looking into, since there is now an enormous waste of\r\nthis part of the fruit by canneries. Oils extracted from peach-kernels\r\nmay be used for the same commercial purposes as the almond oils;\r\nnamely, in medicine, for soaps, cosmetics, perfumes and confections.\r\nThe processes of extraction and distillation are not complex and\r\nestablishments equipped with steam would have little difficulty in\r\nextracting these oils. It is said, too, that the press-cake from\r\nwhich the oils have been extracted makes valuable stock-foods or\r\nfertilizers owing to its high content of nitrogenous matter. It is\r\nestimated that in California alone the quantity of peach-pits obtained\r\nas a by-products of canneries amounts to 10,000 tons in a normal\r\nyear; that these would yield from 600 to 1,200 tons of kernels from\r\nwhich 210 to 420 tons of oil could be extracted. The wholesale price\r\nof bitter-almond oil, or oils purchased under this name, for which\r\npeach-oil could be substituted, is from $3.25 to $4.75 per pound.\r\n\r\nPliny named several medicinal uses for the peach and from his time\r\ndown the flesh, kernels, leaves, bark and blossoms have had a place\r\nin the pharmacopoeia of various countries though nowadays little used\r\nexcept in domestic therapeutics. All of the structures named abound in\r\na bitter and astringent principle and most of them produce hydrocyanic\r\nacid upon maceration with water. The peach might have value in medicine\r\nfor this acid were not the chemical more easily obtained elsewhere. The\r\noils from the kernels, as we have seen, may be used in medicine. Noting\r\nthe medicinal uses to which peach-products have been put by various\r\npeoples in various times we find: The leaves are pounded and boiled in\r\nvinegar for a liniment, an eye-wash, a cure for \"scurf,\" a preventive\r\nof bald heads, and as an insecticide on the heads of children. The\r\nblossoms, treated in various ways, have been used for the same ailments\r\nand also as a febrifuge. The burned pits are also used in making\r\nlampblack for paints.\r\n\r\nFor more than two thousand years stories have been rife of the\r\npoisonous properties of peach-pits and peach-leaves. In a careful\r\nperusal of peach-literature for this period and in several languages\r\nwe have not found a single case cited of fatal results to man or beast\r\nfrom eating the leaves or kernels of peaches. No doubt these stories\r\narise from common knowledge that parts of the peach, as the kernels\r\nand possibly the leaves, contain prussic acid though in so minute\r\nquantities as never to be toxic in any quantity likely to be eaten by\r\nhumans or animals. No doubt, too, the myth that the Persians sent the\r\npeach to the Egyptians as a deadly poison is still perpetuated.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the peach is fine-grained and takes a beautiful polish and\r\nin Europe is used somewhat in cabinet-work and toy-making. Its numerous\r\nreddish-brown veins make it a most beautiful wood but the trees seldom\r\nattain sufficient size to give the species value as a lumber-product.\r\n\r\nThe peach is attractive to the eye at all seasons. A tree or an\r\norchard in bloom is a strikingly beautiful sight while a panorama in a\r\npeach-country in flowering-time is one of the most beautiful scenes in\r\nnature. There is a great difference in the floral beauty of varieties,\r\nsome sorts having very inconspicuous flowers while others rank with our\r\nfinest ornamentals when in bloom. Several types of _Prunus persica_\r\nare planted for beauty of flower and foliage but the fruit-producing\r\npeaches are almost never planted for landscape effect though their\r\npeculiarly sunny expression in leaf and flower, one of the best types\r\nof cheerfulness among trees, should make them useful either standing\r\nalone or in mass for ornamental planting. Those who have seen the wild\r\nwayside peaches of Kentucky or Tennessee in bloom will always think of\r\nthe species as an ornamental as well as a fruit-tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACH-YELLOWS\r\n\r\nYellows is a disease or malignant condition, it is not known which,\r\nvirulent and contagious whatever it may be, and is the possession\r\nprimarily of the region north of the Ohio and Potomac and east of the\r\nMississippi. At one time or another it has been a cause of decline of\r\nthe peach-orchards in every part of the region outlined. Epidemics of\r\nyellows have wholly obliterated thriving peach-industries which in some\r\ncases covered counties. The changes wrought by yellows come so quickly\r\nand are so final, so complete and so widespread in their consequences\r\nthat the disease stands alone among the troubles of plants in the\r\nextent of its influence on the crop affected. Under somewhat better\r\ncontrol now, its havoc is less than formerly, but in the past it has\r\noutdone all other accidents combined that have happened to peaches\r\nin America, including frosts, floods, drought, insects, fungi and\r\ninjuries due to man and quadrupeds. The mystery of yellows in most of\r\nits aspects makes its known history all the more significant. We lack\r\nknowledge of what it is, or whence it came, nor do we know of any cure;\r\nwe know only some of the circumstances and the terrible consequences to\r\nthe peach. Yellows began its siege of the peach in the very beginning\r\nof commercial peach-growing in America. Much of the history of the\r\npeach is written in the hundred-years-warfare that has ensued.\r\n\r\nJudge Richard Peters of Philadelphia first described and gave name to\r\npeach-yellows. February 11, 1806, he read a paper \"On Peach Trees\"\r\nbefore the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture. In this\r\npaper we have the first clear account of yellows:[212]\r\n\r\n\"About fifty years ago, on the farm on which I now reside, my father\r\nhad a large peach orchard, which yielded abundantly. Until a general\r\ncatastrophe befell it plentiful crops had been for many years produced\r\nwith very little attention. The trees began nearly at once to sicken,\r\nand finally perished. Whether by the wasp then undiscovered, or by some\r\nchange in our climate, I know not. For forty years past I have observed\r\nthe peach trees in my neighborhood to be short-lived. Farther south, in\r\nthe western country, and, it seems, in some parts of New Jersey they\r\nare durable and productive as they had been formerly here. * * * The\r\nworm or grub, produced by the wasp depositing its progeny in the soft\r\nbark near the surface of the ground, is the most common destroyer. *\r\n* * When trees become sickly I grub them up. I find that sickly trees\r\noften infect those in vigor near them by some morbid effluvia. Although\r\nI have had trees twenty years old, and knew some of double that age\r\n(owing probably to the induration of the bark rendering it impervious\r\nto the wasp, and the strength acquired when they had survived early\r\nmisfortunes), yet in general they do not live in tolerable health after\r\nbearing four or five crops. * * * Fifteen or sixteen years ago I lost\r\none hundred and fifty peach trees in full bearing in the course of two\r\nsummers by a disease engendered in the first season. I attribute its\r\norigin to some morbid infection in the air. * * * The disorder being\r\ngenerally prevalent would, among animals, have been called an epidemic.\r\nFrom perfect verdure the leaves turned yellow in a few days, and the\r\nbodies blackened in spots. Those distant from the point of infection\r\ngradually caught the disease. I procured young trees from a distance\r\nin high health and planted them among the least diseased. In a few\r\nweeks they became sickly, and never recovered. * * * After my general\r\ndefeat and most complete overthrow, in which the worm had no agency, I\r\nrecruited my peaches from distant nurseries, not venturing to take any\r\nout of those in my vicinity. I have since experienced a few instances\r\nof this malady, and have promptly, on the first symptoms appearing,\r\nremoved the subjects of it, deeming their cases desperate in themselves\r\nand tending to the otherwise inevitable destruction of others.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last few lines of this account, Judge Peters gives the only\r\nmeans so far discovered to check the spread of the disease--the prompt\r\ndestruction of affected trees--a striking commentary on the baffling\r\nnature of yellows when we consider what science has done, since Judge\r\nPeters wrote, toward the control of other plant-diseases. In a note of\r\nlater date, page 23 of the same article, Judge Peters speaks of \"the\r\ndisease I call the yellows,\" thus giving name to a trouble that until\r\nthen had been known as \"decay\" or \"degeneracy\" in the peach.\r\n\r\nLater Judge Peters writes:[213] \"I am pursuing my old plan of\r\nre-instating my peach trees lost last season (1806 or 1807) by my\r\nunconquerable foe, the disease I call the yellows. I obtain them from\r\ndifferent nurseries free from this pestiferous affection. The worm or\r\nwasp (Ægeria) I have in complete subjection. I should be perfectly\r\ndisinterested in proposing that the society offer a premium for\r\npreventing the disease so fatal; for I shall never gain the reward.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:[214] \"I still think that the disease so generally fatal\r\n(more so this year than any other in my memory), called the yellows,\r\nis atmospherical. * * * Compare this account (of thrifty orchards in\r\nDelaware) with the actual state of the peach in our country, and judge\r\nwhether we live in a region favorable to its growth. Mr. Heston's\r\nattempt at cultivating this tree in the Southern manner begins already\r\nto fail. His trees are evidently infected, and many are on the decline.\r\nThe yellows are universally prevalent this season throughout the whole\r\ncountry (_i. e._, around Philadelphia).\"\r\n\r\nWe have given but little out of much that Judge Peters wrote on\r\nyellows, his observations and experiences covering nearly a generation.\r\nWe have quoted sufficiently from his accounts, however, indubitably to\r\nestablish the fact that peach-yellows was rampant about Philadelphia at\r\nleast as early as 1800. Smith[215] puts the appearance of yellows in\r\nthis region as probably some time prior to 1791. By this time there was\r\na considerable body of scientific and practical agricultural literature\r\nin America, and we may assume, since no trouble that could possibly\r\nbe identified as yellows had been described as existing elsewhere in\r\nAmerica, though the peach-borer is frequently discussed, that the\r\ndisease at this period, about 1800, was restricted to the neighborhood\r\nof Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWe now find the yellows gradually extending into neighboring\r\nstates--Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland and New York. Wm. Coxe of New\r\nJersey who in 1807 wrote Judge Peters, \"I am perfectly ignorant of the\r\ndisease to which you give the name yellows,\" in 1817 knew it only too\r\nwell as \"a malady which no remedy can cure nor cultivation avert,\" and\r\ndevotes nearly two pages in his _Fruit Trees_ to a discussion of its\r\nnature.[216] References to yellows in all of the states named by this\r\ntime had become general. Our purpose to show the spread, effects, and\r\nearly treatment of the disease is fully served by quoting at length\r\nfrom a single author--a keen observer, careful writer and the most\r\nnotable horticultural and botanical authority of his time, Wm. Prince,\r\nof Flushing, Long Island.[217] To Prince, by the way, we are indebted\r\nfor the first reference to what is now considered the most certain\r\nsymptom of yellows--premature ripening of fruit. Prince says:\r\n\r\n\"This disease, which commenced its ravages in New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania about the year 1797, and in New York in 1801, and has\r\nspread through several of the states, is by far more destructive to\r\npeach trees than the worm, and is evidently contagious. This disease\r\nis spread at the time when the trees are in bloom, and is disseminated\r\nby the pollen or farina blowing from the flowers of diseased trees,\r\nand impregnating the flowers of those which are healthy, and which\r\nis quickly circulated by the sap through the branches, foliage, and\r\nfruit, causing the fruit, wherever the infection extends, to ripen\r\nprematurely. That this disease is entirely distinct from the worm, is\r\nsufficiently proved by the circumstance, that peach trees which have\r\nbeen inoculated on plum or almond stocks, though less affected by the\r\nworm, are equally subject to the yellows--and a decisive proof of its\r\nbeing contagious is, that a healthy tree, inoculated from a branch of\r\na diseased one, instead of restoring the graft to vigour and health,\r\nimmediately becomes itself infected with the disease. As all efforts\r\ntotally to subdue it must require a long course of time, the best\r\nmethod to pursue towards its eventual eradication, is to stop its\r\nprogress, and prevent its farther extension--to accomplish which, the\r\nfollowing means are recommended, which have been found particularly\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a tree is discovered to possess the characteristics of the\r\ndisease, which is generally known by the leaves putting on a sickly\r\nyellow appearance--but of which the premature ripening of the fruit is\r\na decisive proof--it should be marked, so as to be removed the ensuing\r\nautumn, which must be done without fail, for if left again to bloom, it\r\nwould impart the disease to many others in its vicinity; care is also\r\nnecessary, in its removal, to take out all the roots of the diseased\r\ntree, especially if another is to be planted in the same place, so that\r\nthe roots of the tree to be planted may not come in contact with any of\r\nthose of the one which was diseased.\r\n\r\nIf your neighbour has trees infected with the yellows in a quarter\r\ncontiguous to yours, it will be necessary to prevail on him to remove\r\nthem, that yours may not be injured by them. By being thus particular\r\nin speedily removing such trees as may be infected, the disease is\r\nprevented from extending itself to the rest of the orchard, and the\r\nresidue will consequently be preserved in perfect health at the\r\ntrifling loss of a few trees annually from a large orchard.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of yellows on the peach-industry of the country is shown\r\nby indicating when it appeared in the various states in which peaches\r\nare grown in eastern America and by noting the effects of epidemics of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, following the first outbreak, peach-growing all but\r\ndisappeared, to reappear again from time to time in new regions or in\r\nold ones following an interval of years after a plague had passed.\r\nPeriods and places of epidemics are indicated by such quotation as\r\nfollow: Wm. G. Warren, Centre County, reports in 1851: \"A majority\r\nof the peach trees have been destroyed by the yellows.\"[218] In\r\nthe proceedings of the American Pomological Society for 1852, a\r\nPennsylvanian reports for the State: \"Peaches have done but ill with\r\nus for some years past. The yellows have swept off thousands of\r\ntrees.\"[219] In 1880 in a book on the peach, Rutter devotes many pages\r\nto yellows in Pennsylvania and speaks of \"thousands of trees dead and\r\ndying from the disease in Chester and Delaware counties.\"[220] The\r\nepidemic in the eighties seems to have been particularly severe, there\r\nbeing at the end of the decade but 1,146,342 bearing trees in the State\r\nwhich by 1900 had increased to 3,521,930 trees.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of all states, in proportion to area planted, New Jersey has\r\nsuffered most from yellows. Beginning with the epidemic mentioned by\r\nCoxe in 1817, there have been several disastrous irruptions of the\r\ndisease in that State. A particularly destructive epidemic must have\r\nraged in the early forties, for in 1846 W. R. Prince, Flushing, Long\r\nIsland, says:[221] \"Any one who visits the once splendid peach orchards\r\nin various parts of New Jersey will be struck by the desolate aspect\r\nof innumerable plantations of dead trees, with only here and there\r\na sprig of verdure amid the mighty mass.\" Another writer, Colonel\r\nEdward Wilkins, says: \"Fifty thousand acres in peach trees, in two\r\ncounties only, had been destroyed by the yellows prior to 1850;\" and\r\nin 1858, he further states that \"at that time nearly the whole of the\r\npeach orchards of New Jersey had been destroyed by yellows.\"[222]\r\nHe concludes, in the same article, that \"in New Jersey the peach\r\nbelongs to the past.\" We choose as the last of the many accounts of\r\ndisaster from yellows in this State two quotations from Professor P. D.\r\nPenhallow written in 1882:[223]\r\n\r\n\"In New Jersey, where the ravages of the disease have been more\r\nseriously felt than elsewhere, the southern counties were formerly\r\nthe center of the peach industry for the entire State, but, owing to\r\nthe prevalence of the yellows the peach orchards have been gradually\r\nmoving northward, until at the present time the counties of Morris\r\nand Hunterdon have the largest interest involved, and the prospect is\r\nthat a few more years will see even these localities deprived of the\r\nindustry.\"\r\n\r\n\"The peach growers of New Jersey consider an orchard worth nothing\r\nafter the age of nine years. At that time they root out all the trees\r\nas they would so many corn stumps, and use the land for general crops,\r\nplanting a young orchard of seedlings each year to make good the loss.\"\r\n\r\nStill passing northward from the first center of infection, we come to\r\nNew York, where, according to Wm. Prince, in a foregoing quotation,\r\nthe disease appeared as early as 1801. The son of this writer, W.\r\nR. Prince, in the continuation of the article quoted on page 121,\r\nwritten in 1846, says: \"In this island the malady became exhausted\r\nsome years since by the utter destruction of the old orchards, and\r\nthe determination not to plant new ones until it became extinct. This\r\nproved most fortunate as the disease has been for years banished from\r\nLong Island, and now new orchards are springing up everywhere, and\r\nevery garden is becoming readorned with the finest varieties of the\r\nPeach 'redolent with health.'\" A. J. Downing,[224] writing in 1849,\r\nreports: \"Fifteen years ago there was scarcely a tree in the vicinity\r\nof Newburgh that was not more or less diseased with the yellows. By\r\npursuing the course we have indicated (destruction by burning), the\r\ndisease has almost disappeared.\" Thirty years later, Charles Downing,\r\nwriting from Newburgh, states: \"We have had the yellows here at\r\nintervals for over sixty years, some times continuing for five or six\r\nyears and then several years free from it.\"\r\n\r\nAt present, 1916, peaches are freely planted along the Hudson in the\r\nregion of which the Downings wrote, and, whether from following the\r\nmethod of A. J. Downing in burning the trees, or whether we are in one\r\nof the intervals of immunity noted by Charles Downing, peach-yellows,\r\nwhile present, causes but small losses. One might enlarge at length on\r\nthe vagaries of yellows but we can concern ourselves only with the main\r\nfacts of its history. We now follow the disease from eastern to western\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nLooking through the records of the hundred years of peach-growing in\r\nwestern New York, we find little to indicate that yellows has ever\r\nbeen the scourge in this region that it is pictured to have been\r\neastward and southward or even westward in Michigan. The explanation?\r\nGrowers, as a rule, promptly cut out diseased trees. Here there has\r\nbeen less dilly-dallying and fewer hocus-pocus remedies in treating\r\nyellows. Western New York, more than other regions, has been favored\r\nin the century past by its many eminent horticulturists, several\r\nfruit-growers' societies and by farmers' publications. The result is\r\nthat there is an enlightened and energetic body of peach-growers, who,\r\ninstead of catching and catching at every will-o-the-wisp notion about\r\nyellows, have prevented its spread by proper orchard-sanitation. Yet\r\nthe yellows is here and has been since 1824 at least. In that year\r\nDavid Thomas, father of J. J. Thomas, the pomological writer, planted\r\npeaches from Flushing, Long Island, on the shore of Cayuga Lake, which\r\ndeveloped yellows with the resulting loss of every tree.[225] But in\r\n1844 John J. Thomas records: \"In Western New York it is comparatively\r\nunknown, and great care should be used by cultivators that it be not\r\nintroduced by importations.\"[226] In New York the depreciation of real\r\nestate caused by yellows has not been nearly so marked as in other\r\npeach-regions because of the greater diversification of fruit-growing\r\nthan in other eastern states.\r\n\r\nThis region not only has not had yellows continuously but has never had\r\nthe sudden and violent invasions of the disease that have laid waste\r\nthe orchards in other communities of intensive culture of this fruit.\r\nThe one exception, possibly, was in the decade running from 1875 to\r\n1885. A. M. Smith,[227] writing in 1878, says that hundreds of bushels\r\nof high-colored, insipid, premature peaches were sold in western New\r\nYork in 1877, that one orchard in Niagara County was destroyed by the\r\ndisease and that others in the vicinity were badly affected. Charles\r\nW. Garfield, a prominent Michigan horticulturist, reported in 1880\r\nthat J. S. Woodward of Lockport, New York, had a young orchard of\r\npeaches, covering thirty acres, so badly diseased that the trees would\r\nhave to be taken out before having produced a crop. Later, 1887,[228]\r\nMr. Woodward, speaking for his neighborhood, says that yellows has\r\n\"nearly finished the orchards.\"[229] To conclude as to the conditions\r\nof orchards at the close of this epidemic, we have from Col. F. D.\r\nCurtis[230] the report, in 1887, that yellows had destroyed whole\r\norchards in the western counties of New York especially in Niagara\r\nand Ontario. At this writing, 1916, yellows may almost be said to be a\r\nminor difficulty in peach-growing in western New York.\r\n\r\nPeach-culture has been comparatively unimportant in Connecticut and\r\nMassachusetts until recent years but the toll taken by yellows has\r\nbeen proportionately as high as elsewhere in the hundred years of its\r\ntrespassing. The history of its ravages is told in such statements\r\nas follows: \"Yellows appeared in the vicinity of New Haven in 1820\r\nand destroyed thousands of trees nearly putting an end to peach\r\ngrowing.\"[231] \"The yellows are destroying our peach trees.\"[232]\r\n\"Peaches are infected with yellows and are generally things of the\r\npast.\"[233] \"Cultivation of the peach is now abandoned in consequence\r\nof that scourge to that fruit known as yellows.\"[234] The foregoing\r\naccounts apply to Connecticut but reports are much the same for\r\nMassachusetts, the following being typical: A writer in 1882 declares\r\nthat yellows about Boston was unknown in 1837 but that \"when it came\r\nit swept everything.\"[235] \"Thirty or forty years ago (1842-1852)\r\npeaches were grown in great abundance in this vicinity (northeast\r\nMassachusetts) but for the last twenty years have been almost\r\nabandoned.\"[236] \"In former years (said in 1854) peach trees have\r\nrarely suffered from yellows in this neighborhood (Cambridge) where now\r\nmany trees are affected by it.\"[237]\r\n\r\nSweeping westward from New York, yellows appeared in Ohio about the\r\nmiddle of the Nineteenth Century, for, in 1851, an orchard of 600 trees\r\nat Saint Clairsville was said to have been destroyed by it.[238] In\r\nthe same year the report came from Richard County: \"Our peach trees\r\nare somewhat affected by yellows.\"[239] In the years that follow, down\r\nto the present time, the presence of yellows, its symptoms, affects\r\nand treatment are discussed in the voluminous records of agriculture\r\nin Ohio as a commonplace part in the culture of the peach though the\r\ndisease seems not to have been quite so virulent nor so often epidemic\r\nin Ohio as in other prominent peach-growing states.\r\n\r\nNowhere has the haste and waste of yellows been more apparent than\r\nin the peach-belt of western Michigan. The history of the disease is\r\nwell established in this region, the main facts being: The disease\r\nappeared about Saint Joseph and Benton Harbor, Berrien County, in\r\nthe late sixties of the last century. At first spreading slowly, its\r\nmovement became more rapid \"until by 1877-78 it was destructively\r\nprevalent in nearly every orchard in the county.\"[240] \"The peach\r\nindustry was literally swept out of Berrien County in one decade.\r\nThere can be no doubt of this. From being the foremost peach county\r\nin Michigan, with an acreage more than equal to that of all other\r\ncounties combined (6000 acres in 1874), it became ninth in order, and\r\ncould boast of only 503 acres.\"[241] In 1877, T. T. Lyon declares:[242]\r\n\"This violent and contagious disease has nearly destroyed the peach\r\norchards at Saint Joseph.\" Three years later in the annual report of\r\nthe State Pomological Society, Charles W. Garfield, secretary, says\r\n\"there are scarcely any peach orchards left at Saint Joseph.\"[243] The\r\ndepreciation of peach-lands at this time, due to yellows, was so great\r\nas to threaten the community with bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nPitiful was the case of the growers in Berrien County; pitiful enough\r\nthat of those in Van Buren County, next on the north, but not so bad\r\nowing to the timely and strict enforcement of a \"yellows law\" early\r\npassed by the State legislature. The disease seems to have become\r\nestablished in Van Buren County about 1870 but did not become rampant\r\nuntil four or five years later \"when about five per cent of the trees\r\nwere found diseased and were taken out.\"[244] Then came such reports\r\nas these: \"At least 5,000 trees have been destroyed by this disease\r\nthe past season in this county alone.\"[245] \"That dreaded ravage of\r\nthe peach-grower, yellows, has made slow but marked progress during\r\nthe years in this locality.\"[246] \"If the yellows continues to spread,\r\nit will be only a question of years when peach-growing will cease on\r\nthe lake shore.\"[247] These three reports, out of many such, give the\r\ncondition of the peach-orchards in western Van Buren. In the eastern\r\npart of the county, especially about Lawton where the peach is largely\r\ngrown, the disease was later in appearing, cutting out was more\r\nstrictly attended to, and the damage, therefore, was markedly less.\r\n\r\nAllegan County, north of Van Buren, along the lake shore at least,\r\nsuffered from yellows rather less, though nearly as badly as the\r\nregion to the south. The disease was less and less virulent as the\r\npeach-belt extends northward. At Traverse City, the most northern\r\npoint in the peach-belt, yellows has never been epidemic. Passing\r\neastward, the disease appeared about Grand Rapids, the center of\r\npeach-culture in Kent County, in 1883 and in the decade that followed\r\ntook from peach-growers the toll usual in western Michigan. Eastward\r\nfrom Kent County, however, in the several small and rather isolated\r\ncases of peach-growing yellows either has not appeared or has been an\r\nunimportant factor.\r\n\r\nThe lowest ebb in Michigan orchards from yellows was reached in the\r\neighties after which new plantings increased remarkably, the number\r\nof bearing trees in 1889 being but 1,919,104 and in 1899, 8,104,415.\r\nThe disease still persists in Michigan wherever in former times it\r\nbecame established. Yellows seems, however, to have lost much of its\r\nold time virulency; or, perhaps, the fact that peach-growers are more\r\nprompt and thorough in destroying diseased trees accounts for the\r\ndecrease of the disease. Then, too, the Michigan peach-belt has had the\r\nbitter experience in the last decade or two, of several winter freezes\r\nwhich have wiped out whole orchards, discouraged many planters, and,\r\ntogether with the keen competition of new peach-regions, reduced the\r\nsize of orchards and scattered the plantations so that, in the lessened\r\ncommunal intensity, yellows has less opportunity.\r\n\r\nGoing back, now, to the place of first infection and passing southward,\r\nwe find that yellows, though not more virulent in Delaware than in\r\nMichigan, was much more devastating. Destruction is the only efficient\r\nmethod in treating yellows. The necessity of this drastic measure\r\nhas been proclaimed by every authority from Judge Peters, discover\r\nof yellows, down. The strong arm of the law in many states enforces\r\ndestruction. In Delaware, however, growers were more dilatory in\r\ndestroying yellows-trees than elsewhere--in fact for the first\r\nhalf-century made little attempt so to check the disease. When the\r\nscales fell from the eyes of orchard-owners in this State the industry\r\nwas already ruined. From hundreds of accounts, the ups and downs of\r\npeach-growing in Delaware as caused by yellows may be shown by a few\r\nbrief statements.\r\n\r\nThe peach-industry began in Delaware about 1830 and there are few\r\nreferences to peach-yellows until a decade or two after that time,\r\nthough Dr. John J. Black says that the disease had been known in the\r\nState \"since the war of 1812.\"[248] The yellows-sweep really began\r\nin the northern part of Delaware in New Castle County, in the early\r\nforties, when, according to John Delano, Isaac Reeves' peach-trees\r\nwere dying of yellows by the score \"maugre all his care, cultivation\r\nand circumspection.\"[249] In 1846, James W. Thompson, in a splendid\r\naccount of the peach-industry in Delaware, names the borer and yellows\r\nas the two devastating enemies of this fruit and speaks of the\r\nlatter as a \"constitutional, consumptive or marasmatic disease for\r\nwhich no other remedy is known or to be practiced, but extirpation\r\nand destruction.\"[250] \"By 1855 the yellows had taken possession of\r\nnearly all the orchards, and peach culture in this section was at an\r\nend.\"[251] Yet in the same county, about Middletown, but a few miles\r\nto the south, the disease though present was not epidemic nor did it\r\nbecome so until twenty years later.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the orchards in northern New Castle, the southern\r\npart of the county became the center of the industry in Delaware.\r\nHere, in the early seventies, there were from 1,000,000 to 1,750,000\r\ntrees covering from 10,000 to 17,500 acres.[252] Yellows, according\r\nto numerous accounts, became virulent about 1870, was at its height\r\nin 1875, after which the progress and outcome of the epidemic is\r\nessentially the same as in the northern part of the county--the\r\nyellows-sweep was driving slowly but surely southward. Thus, in 1880,\r\nthe center of the industry was in Kent County, second south of the\r\nthree counties in Delaware, there being in 1879, according to the\r\ncensus of 1880, nearly 2,000,000 trees covering nearly 20,000 acres in\r\nthis county. Yellows, present and widespread at an early date in Kent,\r\nwas not alarmingly destructive until the summers of 1886 and 1887, when\r\nin the northern two-thirds of the county the disease \"spread like wild\r\nfire.\" At this time and as late as 1890, there was little yellows in\r\nsouthern Kent and northern Sussex, but before the end of the century\r\nthe whole State had been swept by yellows. There are no census figures\r\nfor peaches until 1890 when the number of bearing trees in Delaware was\r\n4,521,623. The toll taken by yellows, augmented by San Jose scale, is\r\nindicated by the falling off in number of trees in the next decade, at\r\nthe end of which there were 2,441,650 trees and after another decade,\r\n1909, but 1,177,402 trees.\r\n\r\nBeginning late in the last century, however, there was a revival in\r\npeach-planting in Delaware, especially the northern part of the State,\r\nand now a new peach-industry seems well started in which, through\r\nenergetic orchard-sanitation and diversified horticulture, yellows, for\r\nthe present at least, is held at bay. The palmy days of fabulous prices\r\nfor peaches and peach-lands, however, are past in Delaware. Here, as in\r\nother communities ravaged by yellows, the value of lands has sunk to\r\na half or a quarter of what it would have brought a generation ago in\r\nthe height of peach-culture. In some cases property, formerly valuable,\r\nhas lost all value--a peach-farm will not sell at any price. The best\r\npeach-lands are seldom fit for other crops, so that in Delaware, New\r\nJersey and Michigan the whole community, including railroads and\r\nsteamboat lines, suffers to the verge of bankruptcy when yellows\r\nexterminates the orchards.\r\n\r\nProbably in no other State in the Union is the peach more perfectly\r\nat home than in Maryland, it having held undisputed supremacy among\r\nfruits in that State for over a century and a half. Yellows, though\r\nalways menacing, has not been so devastating as in Delaware to the\r\nnorth. Erwin F. Smith thinks that yellows has been present in the\r\nnorthern counties of eastern Maryland for many years--since 1844 or\r\n1845. In his detailed account of the disease in this State[253] he\r\nrecords but one destructive outbreak of yellows, this occurring in the\r\nsummers of 1886, 1887 and 1888 in the northeastern part of the State\r\nwhere in two counties along the whole length of the Sassafras River\r\nit was destructively present. Smith notes that yellows, at this time,\r\n\"is moving southward on the peninsula.\" Since Smith's account, 1888,\r\nreports from Maryland show that, while the disease is still present\r\nand is now in practically all parts of the State, either it is not now\r\nso virulent or is kept in check by extirpating diseased trees. Still,\r\nhowever, the great decrease in the number of peach-trees in Maryland in\r\nthe last twenty years is largely due to yellows, there being 6,113,287\r\nbearing trees in 1889, but 4,017,854 in 1899, and only 1,497,724 in\r\n1909.\r\n\r\nIn the South, west of the Mississippi, and on the Pacific Coast,\r\nyellows does not exist or if so is not epidemic.\r\n\r\nWould that it could be recorded, as we conclude this brief account of\r\nyellows and its plague-spots in America, that in the hundred years\r\nof conflict some headway had been made in ascertaining from whence\r\nthe disease came, what its cause and what the cure. Would, too, that\r\nwe could believe that the final holocaust has passed. But we cannot\r\nbandage our eyes against the facts. We are as profoundly ignorant\r\nof yellows as at the start. And, while New York at the moment is\r\nnearly free from yellows, everywhere the sinister reminders of ancient\r\nepidemics, like skeletons at a feast that are never out of sight, bid\r\nus be on our guard for new outbreaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACH-BREEDING\r\n\r\nBut little effort has been made, as the histories of its varieties\r\nshow, to breed peaches. All but a very few varieties have come from\r\nchance seedlings. Peaches were grown from seed for centuries and many\r\ntypes now come true when seeds are planted. After budded trees became\r\nthe vogue, until Mendel's great discovery, breeding the peach consisted\r\nin selecting an occasional meritorious tree, multiplying it by budding\r\nand, if it had pronounced merit, turning it over to a nurseryman\r\nfor the trade. The art progressed no further because selection was\r\nthought to be the fundamental process in improving plants and breeders\r\npreferred to work in fields where the harvests were more immediate\r\nthan in tree-fruits. Now that plant-breeding centers around controlled\r\nhybridization, plants propagated vegetatively should receive quite as\r\nmuch attention as those grown from seed. Mendel has opened the door\r\nto intimate familiarity with some of the fundamental phenomena of\r\nhybridization, and, despite the difficult and complex literature the\r\nprofessionals are imposing on the art, chiefly discussions of methods\r\nand disputations about principles, the layman finds Mendelian laws easy\r\nto put in practice; and peach-breeding is certain to go forward in\r\nleaps and bounds as the irresistible fascination of the subject seizes\r\npeach-growers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as a foundation for future work, it becomes highly important\r\nto know how the varieties we have came into existence. The known\r\nhistories of the many diverse kinds of peaches show that this fruit\r\nhas been improved almost wholly through new varieties by chance\r\nhybridization--self-fertilized seed, selection and mutations are almost\r\nnegligible factors. The following are the data: No case is recorded\r\nin _The Peaches of New York_ of a variety known to have come from a\r\nself-fertilized seed. The seed parent is given for 214 varieties; the\r\nseed and pollen parents of 37 varieties. But 4 varieties are reported\r\nto have come from bud-mutations. Of chance seedlings, sorts from seed\r\nwith neither parent known, there are 161. The origins of 1765 of the\r\nvarieties described in _The Peaches of New York_ are unknown. The total\r\nnumber of peaches described is 2181.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPEACH-GROWING IN NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the peach, whether narrative or natural, shows that this\r\nfruit succeeds commercially only in restricted areas under special soil\r\nand climatic conditions. In the United States, as we have seen, the\r\npeach-industry has sprung up in a dozen or more distinct geographical\r\nregions, three of which are in New York. In discussing peach-growing in\r\nNew York we must, first, determine the boundaries of its peach-regions;\r\nsecond, show the relative importance of the peach-industry in each;\r\nand, third, note the determinants that make favored parts of the State\r\npeach-regions.\r\n\r\nThe three main peach-areas in New York are the Hudson River Valley,\r\nthe shore of Lake Ontario and the lands surrounding the Finger Lakes.\r\nThe relative importance of these areas is shown by the number of trees\r\nin the regions. More than half of the peach-trees in New York are\r\nalong the south shore of Lake Ontario, the total number in bearing\r\nfor the region in 1909 being 1,271,514. The two counties of the State\r\nleading in number of trees are in this belt, Niagara with 591,350\r\nand Monroe with 339,375, while of the other three in the belt there\r\nare 166,584 in Wayne, 157,934 in Orleans and 16,271 in Oswego. The\r\nHudson River Valley district is second in importance, with a total of\r\n679,662 trees, of which Ulster County, ranking third in the State, has\r\n313,971, and Orange, with fourth rank, has 212,879, while Dutchess has\r\n63,741, Columbia 51,818, Rockland 21,081 and Westchester 16,172. The\r\nFinger Lakes region, with a much smaller area of suitable land, has\r\nbut 322,179 trees, of which Seneca County has 81,440, Ontario 56,495,\r\nSchuyler 51,993, Yates 48,350, Tompkins 34,090 and Livingston, a little\r\nto the west of this region proper, 19,251.\r\n\r\nLong Island, once the seat of a considerable peach-industry, now has\r\nbut 34,348 trees, 30,333 in Suffolk County and 4,015 in Nassau. There\r\nis a large area on the shore of Lake Erie suitable for peaches but land\r\nhere is mainly planted with grapes; yet Chautauqua County has 32,377\r\nand Erie 10,987 trees. Beside these main and subsidiary peach-regions\r\nthere are many localities in which peaches are grown for local markets\r\nor home use. Peach statistics for the State emphasize strikingly the\r\nfact that the peach is a specialist's crop and that it can be grown\r\nonly in special environments. Thus, compare the figures given for\r\npeach-growing counties with these: In two counties in New York there\r\nis not a peach-tree; in six counties there are less than twenty-five\r\ntrees each; in twenty-two counties there are fewer than five hundred\r\ntrees or less than five acres in any one; of the sixty-one counties\r\nin the State, only twenty-four average more than one hundred acres\r\nplanted to peaches and but six have more than a thousand acres. There\r\nare still, however, acres beyond calculation, fecund for peaches, many\r\nlying fallow, upon which peaches can be grown when the markets warrant.\r\n\r\nThe acreage for the State and its peach-regions may be determined,\r\napproximately, by dividing the number of trees by 100. In 1909 there\r\nwere 2,457,187 bearing trees and 2,216,907 trees not of bearing age,\r\na total of 4,674,094 trees covering 46,740 acres in the State. At\r\nthis writing, 1916, the acreage is larger. In 1909, along the Ontario\r\nShore there were 12,715 acres planted to bearing peaches; in the\r\nHudson Valley, 6,796; about the Finger Lakes, 3,221; on Long Island,\r\n343; on the shores of Lake Erie, 433. These figures for districts\r\ncover bearing trees only, but holding the proportion the same for the\r\ndistricts as for the State, the total acreage for each district should\r\nbe doubled for 1909 and, we are sure, much more than doubled for 1916.\r\nThe statement that the number of bearing trees has doubled in the past\r\nfive years is supported by figures furnished me by F. S. Welsh,[254]\r\nAgriculturist of the New York Central Railroad Company. The New York\r\nCentral handles at least 95 per centum of the peaches grown in New\r\nYork and shipped to the markets; in 1910 this railroad handled 1,341\r\ncarloads of peaches, 4,419 carloads in 1915.\r\n\r\nNew York ranks third among the states of the Union in the production\r\nof peaches, the value of the crop being but a little less than that\r\nof Georgia though only about half as much as that of California. The\r\nnumber of bearing trees and the yield in bushels of fruit are given in\r\nthe census report of 1910 so that the average production per bearing\r\ntree in the several peach-belts of the country may be computed,\r\nthrowing light on the condition of the orchards in the different\r\nregions. California leads with an average production of 37.8 quarts per\r\ntree; New York follows with 22.6 quarts; after which comes Michigan\r\nwith 18.5; Pennsylvania, 13.7; New Jersey, 11.6; Ohio, 10.5; Georgia,\r\n7.7; and Delaware, which must have had an off year in 1909, but 5\r\nquarts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is worth while putting on record an opinion as to the\r\nstatus of peach-growing in the State at present, 1916. The acreage\r\nis certainly the greatest yet planted in the State--as has been said\r\nnearly or quite double the number of trees bearing in 1909 which\r\nthe last census gives as 1,014,110. Certainly, too, orchards were\r\nnever as well cared for as now. Yet the percentage of unprofitable\r\npeach-orchards in the State is high--at least fifty per centum--for\r\nwhich several causes can be named; as, competition and over-production\r\nwith consequent low prices, poor distribution, a series of seasons with\r\nmuch winter-killing, and a succession of cold, wet springs. These are\r\nepisodes in the industry hard to overcome. Of the avoidable causes of\r\nthe present high percentage of unprofitable orchards perhaps the most\r\ncommon is the attempt to do too much whereby many eventually come to\r\nbankruptcy. Another reason for the many unprofitable orchards of the\r\npresent is that the peach is a favorite fruit for beginners. Profits in\r\npeach-growing are often luring, the peach is an attractive fruit, it\r\nseems easy to grow and the fruit-grower plants, to learn by experience\r\nthat peach-growing is not, as so often pictured, a pleasant and\r\nprofitable avocation but a most exacting vocation.\r\n\r\nWhy is the peach so localistic? In particular, what has set the bounds\r\nof the three restricted peach-areas in New York? To some extent, of\r\ncourse, man-governed agencies have determined where peaches may or may\r\nnot be grown in the State. Peaches must move quickly and the carriers\r\nmust not dip too deeply in the grower's pockets; therefore markets must\r\nnot be too distant and transportation must be cheap and efficient.\r\nAgain, peach-growing is a fine art and becomes thus a specialist's\r\nbusiness that must be learned in the peach-orchard; therefore, even if\r\nsoil and climate be favorable, the industry lags if it lacks leaders\r\nto teach and to set the pace in orcharding. But, outranking by far\r\nthe agencies depending on man, are natural conditions, two of which,\r\nclimate and soil, predetermined where peach-industries were to stand in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\nWhen are plant and climate truly congenial? Perhaps the best test is\r\nthe degree to which the plant spontaneously accommodates itself to all\r\nclimatic conditions. Thus, the peach is ideally suited to climates\r\nin which it maintains itself without the aid of man. The peach is\r\nperfectly at home, then, in America only where it runs wild,--in parts\r\nof the South. In the North, East and the far West, peaches seldom\r\ngrow spontaneously; and the cold of winter, the frosts of spring\r\nand the drouths of summer, in these regions, yearly remind us that\r\nnotwithstanding the generations the tree has been grown in America it\r\nis still a stranger in a foreign country--an exotic from warm and\r\nsunlit Mid-Asia. Yet with a little help from man the peach takes kindly\r\nto many climates in which it does not grow spontaneously. Under what\r\nclimatic conditions does the peach grow spontaneously? And under what\r\nclimatic conditions can the peach be grown with the aid of man as a\r\ncommercial success? These questions can be best answered by discussing\r\nthe two constituents of climate, temperature and rainfall, in relation\r\nto the peach.\r\n\r\nOf the several phases of temperature only extremes in cold are\r\ndeterminants in peach-growing in New York. The peach stands for all\r\nthat is tender and effeminate in a fruit-tree and fares so ill in\r\nwinter's cold that the limits of peach-culture are set in all northern\r\nstates by the winter climate. The undomesticated peach is at the mercy\r\nof the winter wherever the temperature falls below zero and seldom\r\ngrows spontaneously where the mercury drops even to this point. By\r\nselecting hardy varieties and following careful cultural methods,\r\nhowever, peaches may be grown profitably in climates where it is\r\noccasionally as cold as ten degrees below zero. An isothermal line\r\npassing through points in New York where the thermometer marks -10°\r\nin an occasional winter sets the limits of peach-growing in New York.\r\nThe red line in the accompanying map shows the territory in which\r\npeach-growing is reasonably safe in New York while the green line shows\r\nthe outside limits of the industry as determined by cold.\r\n\r\nEven in the favored peach-regions of New York, winter-injury is a\r\nmatter of vital importance to the peach-industry and growers seek means\r\nto avoid or check it. The problem is not an insurmountable one, for\r\nhere and there are orchards and varieties which suffer little injury\r\nthough possibly adjoining others in which trees or buds are wholly or\r\npartially killed. There must be reasons for the injury in the one and\r\nnot in the other. These, the New York Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nmade an attempt to discover a few years ago in letters addressed to the\r\npeach-growers of the State.[255] From the information received, and\r\nthat gained by observation, we may lay down the following propositions\r\nregarding hardiness of the peach in New York.\r\n\r\nFirst.--The soil has much influence on hardiness. The peach must have\r\na warm, dry soil to secure the hardiness inherent in the species.\r\nOnly in such a soil can trees make a strong, firm, well-matured\r\ngrowth, which is conducive to hardiness. Bottom-heat seems especially\r\nnecessary to secure a growth that will withstand cold and for this\r\nreason gravelly and stony soils, since they hold heat well, make good\r\npeach-lands. So, too, a gravelly subsoil seems to provide the proper\r\nroot-environment for the peach-tree and if this be present it matters\r\nlittle, so far as hardiness is concerned, whether it be overlaid with\r\nsand, gravel, loam, a light clay or combinations of these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nSecond.--The amount of moisture in the soil in the winter affects the\r\nhardiness of the peach. Either extreme of moisture, excessive wetness\r\nor excessive dryness, gives favorable conditions for winter-killing. A\r\nwet soil freezes deeply and trees standing in it are sappy throughout\r\nthe winter. Cold, alternating with warm weather, or accompanied with\r\ndry winds, causes excessive evaporation from trees and if the soil be\r\nso dry as not to furnish moisture to replace the water evaporated,\r\nwinter-injury ensues. When twigs and buds shrivel in winter, whether\r\nfrom lack of water or lack of maturity, winter-injury almost invariably\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThird.--Fertilizers may have a helpful or a harmful effect as regards\r\nhardiness of tree. When fertilizers cause a heavy, rank, soft growth,\r\nthey undoubtedly make the trees more susceptible to winter-injury. On\r\nthe other hand, trees suffer as much or more from cold if underfed\r\nthan if overfed. Nothing is more certain than that vigorous growth in\r\nearly summer can be made of great service in counteracting cold and\r\nthat half-starved trees, or those which have been allowed to bear too\r\nheavily, suffer most from freezing.\r\n\r\nFourth.--Cover-crops protect trees from cold. Case after case can be\r\ncited of orchards with cover-crops surviving a cold winter when nearby\r\norchards without the muffler of vegetation, leaves and snow were\r\nkilled. Possibly the cover-crop is the most effective treatment of the\r\npeach-orchard to avoid winter-killing, acting as a cover to protect\r\nthe roots from cold, causing the trees to ripen their wood quickly and\r\nthoroughly and assisting in regulating the supply of moisture.\r\n\r\nFifth.--Low-headed trees suffer less in both trunks and branches from\r\nwinter-injury than high-headed trees. Buds, however, often survive on\r\nthe higher branches and not on the lower ones. The low-headed trees\r\nare less injured probably because the wood loses less moisture by\r\nthe evaporation from the effects of winds than do high-headed trees;\r\nbecause the trunk at least is better protected from the sun and hence\r\nsuffers less from sunscald, one of the effects of freezing and thawing;\r\nand because, for some reason or other, low-headed trees seem to be\r\nmore vigorous than high-headed trees.\r\n\r\nSixth.--Wind-breaks furnish small protection against cold to either\r\ntrees or buds. The value of a wind-break depends largely upon the\r\ntopography of the land. A wind-break so planted as wholly to check\r\ncurrents of air is detrimental so far as cold is concerned; so planted\r\nas to deflect the current of air they may become of value in keeping\r\noff frosts. More often than not, however, they seriously check\r\natmospheric drainage and the damage by frost is greater.\r\n\r\nSeventh.--Young peach-trees suffer more than old trees, probably\r\nbecause the young trees do not mature their wood as well as the older\r\nones. There are, however, many exceptions to the statement that young\r\ntrees are less hardy to cold than old ones. Old trees are often forced\r\nto produce large quantities of new wood susceptible to winter-killing,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the superabundant growth of young trees can\r\nbe kept down by orchard-treatment. Old trees possessing low vitality\r\nare less hardy than vigorous, young trees. Thus, trees suffering from\r\nthe ravages of borers, leaf-curl or other fungus troubles suffer most\r\nfrom cold. While young trees are more susceptible to freezing than\r\nold ones, yet they are much more likely to recover, if recovery be\r\npossible, and their return to a normal condition is more rapid.\r\n\r\nEighth.--What degree of cold will kill peach-trees? Twenty degrees\r\nbelow zero under the best of conditions kills the peach. Depending upon\r\nthe condition in which the trees begin the winter, however, the trees\r\nmay be killed by any temperature between zero and -20°. The following\r\nare the conditions unfavorable to withstanding cold, in about the order\r\nof importance: Immaturity of wood; lack of protection of roots by snow\r\nor cover-crop; poor drainage; overbearing in the preceding year; lack\r\nof vitality from ravages of insects, or fungi or from infertility of\r\nsoil; susceptibility of variety to cold.\r\n\r\nNinth.--What degree of cold will kill peach-buds? Much depends upon\r\nthe condition of the buds. Fifteen degrees below zero seems to be the\r\nlimit that peach-buds can stand even when all conditions are favorable.\r\nThe chief factors influencing tenderness of buds are maturity of buds,\r\nvariety, and the time at which buds finish their resting period.\r\n\r\nTenth.--Small-growing varieties with compact heads are hardier than the\r\nfree-growing sorts with large heads. The following varieties are named\r\nas compact in growth and hence hardier than the average: Chili, Crosby,\r\nGold Drop, Barnard, Kalamazoo, Triumph, Wager and Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nEleventh.--In New York the varieties Crosby, Chili, Stevens, Gold Drop\r\nand Elberta are named as most hardy in wood. As most tender in wood\r\nEarly Crawford, Late Crawford, Chairs, St. John and Niagara are named.\r\nCrosby, Chili, Triumph, Gold Drop, Stevens and Kalamazoo are most hardy\r\nin bud. Early Crawford, Late Crawford, Chairs, Reeves and Elberta are\r\nmost tender in bud.\r\n\r\nThe average date at which the last killing frost occurs in the spring\r\nalso determines the limit in latitude or altitude at which the peach\r\ncan be grown. Even in the favored peach-regions of New York, records\r\nbring out the fact that killing frosts must be expected occasionally to\r\ndestroy the peach-crop and there are few years indeed in which frost\r\ndoes not take heavy toll in the State as a whole. In the twenty-five\r\nyear period beginning with 1881 and ending with 1905, the peach-crop\r\nwas destroyed or seriously injured over a large part of New York in\r\nthirteen seasons.[256] Little or nothing is done in New York to protect\r\nthe peach from frosts. Truth is, not much can be done. Whitewashing\r\ntrees delays blooming time and in some seasons might prevent injury\r\nfrom late frosts but it is too uncertain and too costly to be worth\r\nputting in practice. Wind-breaks as often favor the frost as the tree.\r\nSmudging is too expensive for the extensive system of peach-orcharding\r\npracticed in the East. Failure due to frost may be expected, then, when\r\nthe commonly recognized precautions in selecting frost-proof sites are\r\nnot recognized.\r\n\r\nThe limits of peach-culture in New York are also determined by early\r\nfall frosts and by the length of the growing season, though both are\r\nless important than the winter-climate and late frosts in the spring.\r\nThe peach-grower must be able to synchronize three of these phases of\r\nclimate, spring frosts, fall frosts and length of summer season, with\r\nthe blooming and ripening of peaches,--to do which he must have weather\r\ndata and the dates of blooming and ripening of varieties of peaches.\r\nThe necessary data as to the average dates of spring and fall frosts\r\nand the length of the growing season can be obtained from the nearest\r\nlocal weather bureau and in the accompanying table the blooming and\r\nripening seasons of 181 varieties of peaches grown at the New York\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station are given for the years 1910 to 1914.\r\nBlooming and ripening dates vary in the several peach-regions in the\r\nState so that to make use of the data from this Station consideration\r\nmust be given to the latitude, altitude and local environment of the\r\npeach-orchard.\r\n\r\nThe latitude of the Smith Astronomical Observatory, a quarter of a\r\nmile from the Station orchards, is 42° 52' 46.2\"; the altitude of the\r\norchards is from five hundred to five hundred and twenty-five feet\r\nabove the sea level. The soil is a loamy but rather cold clay; the\r\norchards lie about a mile west of Seneca Lake, a body of water forty\r\nmiles in length and from one to three and one-half miles in width and\r\nmore than six hundred feet deep. The lake has frozen over but a few\r\ntimes since the region was settled, over a hundred years ago, and has a\r\nvery beneficial influence on the adjacent country in lessening the cold\r\nof winter and the heat of summer and in preventing early blooming.\r\n\r\nThe blooming period is that of full bloom. The data were taken from\r\ntrees grown under normal conditions as to pruning, distance apart, and\r\nas to all other factors which might influence the blooming period.\r\nThere is a variation of several days between the time of full bloom of\r\nthe different varieties of peaches. These differences can be utilized\r\nin selecting sorts to avoid injury from frost.\r\n\r\n          BLOOMING PERIODS AND SEASON OF RIPENING OF PEACH-VARIETIES\r\n

=========================================================================\r\n\r\nThe peach seldom suffers from hot weather in New York. The fruit is\r\nsometimes injured in the full blaze of the sun but the foliage usually\r\nfurnishes ample protection against such injury. On the other hand, for\r\na finely finished product the peach must have an unclouded sun and\r\nample air, these conditions giving high color and full flavor.\r\n\r\nThe peach requires less moisture than most other fruits--its original\r\nhome was on the desert's edge in Asia. In New York the rainfall is\r\nusually quite sufficient in all peach-regions for this crop, the\r\nexception being, possibly, in the southern part of the Central Lakes\r\nregion, where, in the lands adapted to the peach, the soil is often\r\nthin and drought, season after season, lays heavily on the land. The\r\npeach in New York more often suffers from too much rain than too\r\nlittle. Cold, wet weather in blooming time is the fruit-grower's vernal\r\nbane in this State and rain not infrequently prevents a set of peaches\r\neven in localities where the spring rainfall is light. Monthly and\r\nseasonal \"means\" of precipitation, especially of the month of May,\r\nare of considerable importance in determining the desirability of a\r\nlocality for peaches.\r\n\r\nThere are several other phases of climate usually of but local\r\napplication which sometimes become of vital importance to the\r\npeach-grower and must receive attention in selecting an orchard-site.\r\nThe direction, force and frequency of prevailing winds during the\r\nblooming and ripening periods; the liability to hail storms; the amount\r\nof cloudiness in the summer months; the nature and degree of seasonal\r\nvariations; the degree of humidity of the atmosphere as related to\r\nfungus diseases, especially the dreaded brown-rot; and the frequency of\r\ndrouths are all problems to be solved before planting the peach.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS FOR PEACHES\r\n\r\nAfter climate, soil has been the next most potent natural influence\r\nin determining the location of the peach-regions of the State and of\r\nindividual orchards in the several regions. The peach, of all fruits,\r\nis most particular as to soils; though, and this seems not generally\r\nunderstood, the physical condition of the land is quite as important as\r\nthe kind of soil. That is, the peach grows well on a rather wide range\r\nof soils if the land be well drained, well aerated and if it hold heat.\r\nAll subsequent treatment fails, whatever the soil, if the root-run be\r\nimpeded by water or lack of air and if there be not the stimulus of\r\nconsiderable bottom-heat. These physical conditions modify greatly what\r\nis to be said in the next paragraph in regard to the kind of soil.\r\n\r\nIn New York the peach thrives best on a light, free-working sandy or\r\ngravelly loam but there are many good peach-orchards in gravelly and\r\nstony clays--gravel and stone furnishing drainage and aeration and\r\nholding heat. Perhaps, in this State, the light types of soil are too\r\noften chosen on the theory that the peach will grow on any light, sandy\r\nsoil. Not so, for the peach will not grow on wind-blown, water-washed\r\nsands; on sand banks, in sand pits, on quicksands, on old sandbars or\r\non pure quartz sands, though it is to be found planted on all of these.\r\nNor will the peach flourish on sandy soils at all unless there be a\r\nfair admixture of clay and decomposed vegetable matter and the whole\r\nunderlain at a depth of not more than three or four feet with a clay\r\nsubsoil or stone which must have natural drainage. The clay subsoil\r\nmust not come nearer to the surface than ten or twelve inches while bed\r\nrock ought not, at the very least, be nearer than twenty inches. So\r\nqualified, sandy soils are ideal soils for peaches in New York. Some\r\nof the best peach-lands in the State are exceedingly stony, the stones\r\nbeing no detriment except in making the land difficult to till.\r\n\r\nThe peach is conspicuous among fruits for its ability to nourish itself\r\nwhere the food supply is meagre--indeed it is the richest resource of\r\nfruit-growers on soils deficient in the most important elements of\r\nplant-food. This does not mean that peach-soils are cheap soils. Few\r\nother crops thrive on peach-soils, which make them of little value\r\nexcept for this fruit, but good peach-soils are so scarce that once\r\ntheir adaptabilities are discovered they are seldom cheap. Peach-soils,\r\nas a rule, are but moderately fertile. When too fertile, especially\r\nwhen rich in nitrogen, the foliage is dense, the wood-growth is great,\r\nthe season's wood does not mature, the set of fruit is small, and the\r\npeaches lack size, color and flavor. But if not rich, never poor. On\r\na good peach-soil the trees should make a relatively small, compact\r\ngrowth of firm wood which each season ripens thoroughly; and, barring\r\naccidents, they should be annually fruitful of large, highly-colored,\r\nwell-flavored, properly-shaped peaches covered with sparse and short\r\npubescence. The fertilization of peach-soils is to be considered in a\r\nseparate topic.\r\n\r\nWe have been generalizing as to the adaptabilities of peaches to soils.\r\nPeach-growing, through keen competition and the great pleasure that a\r\nfinely finished product gives the grower, has become a fine art. Now,\r\nin the refinement of the industry, generalizations as to peach-soils\r\nare not sufficient. Growers must find out what particular varieties\r\ngrow best in their particular soil. To be sure, there are cosmopolitan\r\nvarieties, Elberta for example, which thrive in a diversity of soils,\r\nbut, for most part, each distinct variety or type of varieties has\r\nspecial soil preferences the discovery of which has often made a\r\nman a successful peach-grower. The peculiarities which adapt a soil\r\nto a variety are not analyzable but appear to peach-growers through\r\nintuition or experiment.\r\n\r\nSome fruits are made to grow in uncongenial soils by working them\r\non stocks adapted to the soil. Thus, the peach may be worked on\r\nplum-stocks for heavy, clay soils. Little, however, has been done in\r\nforcing the peach to adapt itself to a soil by consorting varieties and\r\nstocks. There is no doubt, however, but that much may be done when the\r\nadaptabilities of cions to stocks and stocks to soil are better known.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATIONS AND SITES FOR PEACH-ORCHARDS\r\n\r\nThat peach-growing is not capable of equal development in all of\r\nthe agricultural regions of the country and State appears in page\r\nafter page of the history of this fruit. Climate and soil, as\r\nwe have tried to show, are the great determinants of the large\r\ngeographical peach-areas but beside these there are several other\r\nfactors influencing the formation of peach-growing communities; as,\r\ntransportation facilities, markets, labor, ability to make and dispose\r\nof by-products, selling organizations, local climate and so on. The\r\neconomic factors just mentioned, as they apply to the establishment\r\nof peach-belts, have received sufficient notice in the history of\r\nthe peach-industry in the United States, but these, together with\r\nseveral natural factors, need a few words in their local application\r\nto individual plantations under the head of locations and sites for\r\npeach-orchards--the location having to do with the general surroundings\r\nand the site with the particular piece of land to be planted.\r\n\r\nThe dominant considerations in placing commercial peach-orchards in\r\nthe peach-zones in New York seem now to be economic ones. Natural\r\nconditions are so favorable in any of the recognized peach-districts\r\nof the State and obstacles so easily overcome by those who possess\r\ncommon knowledge of peach-growing, that a crop comes almost as a gift\r\nfrom nature. Natural advantages are more common than man-made ones;\r\nso that suitable locations are mostly to be sought for in the centers\r\nof peach-growing near a shipping point where the haul is short, the\r\nfreight service prompt, regular, efficient, with low freight rates and\r\nrefrigerator service, where labor is abundant, and, lastly and very\r\nimportant, where the markets are so placed that they are not controlled\r\nby growers in regions more advantageously situated.\r\n\r\nAdvantages offered by local markets now determine the placing of a good\r\nmany peach-orchards in New York. A location where there is a good local\r\nmarket and at the same time ample facilities for shipping to distant\r\nmarkets is ideal, for it enables the grower to dispose of over-ripe and\r\nsecond-rate peaches that otherwise go to the dump. The local consumer,\r\nhowever, usually suffers. Prosperous towns and cities have added much\r\nto the prosperity of nearby peach-districts in this State but generally\r\nthese local markets have not received the attention from growers they\r\ndeserve. The product sent to the local markets is usually much poorer\r\nthan that shipped to a distance. On the other hand, growers maintain\r\nthat customers in towns in the peach-belts will not pay for good fruit.\r\n\r\nNowhere are the favorable influences of water more admirably\r\nillustrated than in the peach-orchards of New York, all of the\r\npeach-districts being bounded on one or more sides by bodies of water.\r\nThe great majority of the orchards are planted on the shores of one of\r\nthe two Great Lakes, slope toward one of the several Finger Lakes, or\r\nare near flowing water in the Hudson. The equalizing effects of bodies\r\nof water on temperature--warmer winters and cooler summers--and the\r\neffects of the air-currents from bodies of water are so well known\r\nthat comment is not necessary. It is worth while noting, however, the\r\ndistance to which the benign influences of water are felt in the New\r\nYork peach-districts. In the Hudson Valley the peach can be grown only\r\na-mile or two from the river with safety from frosts and freezes. With\r\nfew exceptions, the peach-orchards about the Central Lakes overlook the\r\nwater. On the Great Lakes peach-plantations are found from one to six\r\nor eight miles from the water, depending upon the height of the land,\r\nand the amount and direction of the slope.\r\n\r\nUsually the peach-plantations are some distance above the lakes or\r\nriver, generally from one hundred to three hundred feet. When the\r\naltitude is much higher, immunity from frost and winter freezes ceases,\r\nprobably because the atmosphere is rarer and no doubt drier so that\r\nheat radiates from the land rapidly inducing frostiness rather than\r\nfrostlessness. As the height increases, too, the sweep of the wind\r\nincreases. But still, one is often surprised to find vigorous orchards\r\nperched high above the water, the sport of every wind, so that altitude\r\nin peach-growing must be determined by experiment.\r\n\r\nThe site, as we choose to consider it, is the situation with\r\nespecial regard to the particular plot of ground set aside for the\r\npeach-orchard--altitude, soil, slope, exposure, local climate and all\r\nof the natural factors which favor peach-growing. All these have been\r\ntouched upon in their relation to peach-districts and locations within\r\nthe districts but we need to particularize a little more closely to\r\nshow how some of these factors affect individual orchards.\r\n\r\nThe best peach-orchards in New York are invariably higher than the\r\nsurrounding country, such orchards having the two great advantages of\r\nsoil-drainage and atmospheric drainage. Rolling land seems not to be at\r\nall essential, for many splendid plantations are on flat lands which,\r\nhowever, in all cases have an elevation on one or more boundaries\r\nabove the surrounding country. The more pronounced the elevation,\r\nwithin limits, the better, though sharp declines of a few feet, ten\r\nor fifteen, serve for small orchards as do gentle slopes of slightly\r\nhigher elevation. Ideal spots where the peach never fails are found in\r\nbits of tillable land, usually too small for large commercial ventures,\r\nin the rough and steep gulches running down from the highlands to the\r\nlakes, occasionally on the Ontario and Erie shores, but more often\r\nin the more broken country about the Finger Lakes. In such cases the\r\nrigors of seasons are seldom felt. We do not recall seeing a single\r\nsuccessful peach-orchard in the State shut in on all sides by higher\r\nland--frosts and freezes would soon play havoc in such a situation.\r\n\r\nThe exposure of a peach-plantation is, without doubt, a matter of some\r\nimportance in choosing a site but the value of particular exposures to\r\navoid frosts and secure early, late, or highly colored fruits has been\r\ngreatly over-emphasized by horticultural writers if New York orchards\r\nbe taken as criteria. The theory is most plausible. It runs, in brief:\r\nNorthward slopes are best for peaches in frosty regions since on such\r\nslopes plants remain dormant longest thereby often escaping spring\r\nfrosts. Southward slopes should be selected for early varieties, the\r\nsun and warmth of such an exposure supposedly hastening the ripening\r\ntime. Now the facts are, as we observe them, the peach blossoms with\r\nthe first burst of spring warmth whether the slope face north or south;\r\nand whether north or south makes little difference in ripening because\r\nthe intense heat of our New York summers submerges slight differences\r\nappearing early in the season because of exposure. About all that shows\r\nin the matter of exposure for peach-orchards, in this State is that the\r\nbest slopes are toward the water to secure the effects that dictate the\r\nlocation of orchards near water.\r\n\r\nOne comes across many peach-orchards in New York in the shelter of\r\nhigh hills or heavy forests for which the trees usually show gratitude\r\nin vigor and fruitfulness, provided hill or wood does not shade the\r\norchard too much. Hills and woods provide desirable shelter only when\r\nso situated as to protect against winter winds and summer storms. A\r\nmost remarkable example of winter protection by a forest was to be\r\nseen a few years ago on the somewhat noted fruit-farm of Mr. Grant\r\nHitchings near South Onondaga where peaches are at the limit as regards\r\ntemperature. Here was a peach-orchard half of which was terribly\r\ninjured by winter-killing and the other half, protected by a forest a\r\nquarter-mile away, was wholly unhurt. Yet windbreaks have seldom proved\r\nsatisfactory, usually developing as many or more disadvantages than\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCKS AND THE PROPAGATION OF PEACHES\r\n\r\nThe peach-tree, in common with all other fruit-trees, is a consort of\r\ntwo individuals--a named variety budded on an unnamed seedling. So\r\nfar, the industry has been carried on with little or no regard to the\r\neffects the seedling may have on the variety to which it is budded,\r\nyet there can be no doubt but that the fruiting top is influenced by\r\nthe stock upon which it is worked. The present nursery practice is to\r\nbuy peach-pits, whatsoever they may be, at the lowest price, sow them\r\nin nursery rows and at the proper time bud to named varieties. Time\r\nwas, in the East at least, when the pits came from the run-wild peaches\r\nof the southern states from which grew vigorous, healthy and fairly\r\nuniform seedlings but it is to be feared that most of the pits, the\r\ncountry over, now come from the canneries and from varieties so diverse\r\nin vigor, habit and season that the resulting seedlings are variable\r\nand must make variable the trees grown upon them. It is greatly to\r\nbe regretted that the practice of growing peach stock from southern\r\nwild seed has been departed from though even a better practice might\r\nbe to grow trees from some vigorous variety or, possibly, a different\r\nspecies, as _Prunus davidiana_, which is now largely used in China.\r\n\r\n_Prunus davidiana_ has, as we have stated in discussing the species,\r\nbeen tried very widely in the United States and seems to have many\r\nexcellent qualities for a stock. The seedlings are vigorous, healthy,\r\nhardy, bud readily and the seeds keep well and sprout very uniformly so\r\nthat usually there is a good stand. Perhaps the character that commends\r\nit most highly at present, however, is the hardiness of the species.\r\nIt is proving hardy in colder regions than those where the peach is\r\nnow a commercial crop, so that, wherever this fruit as now grown is at\r\nthe mercy of the winter, _Prunus davidiana_ is a promising substitute\r\nfor the hit-and-miss stocks now used. The drawbacks to the use of\r\nthe Chinese species are that it does not bear fruits of any value\r\nwhatsoever so that the crop would have to be grown for the pits alone\r\nand, because of very early blossoming, the trees bear only in most\r\nfavored situations as regards spring frosts.\r\n\r\nPeach-on-peach is now the rule in eastern America but in Europe, and to\r\na lesser extent on the Pacific slope, several other species are used.\r\nThus, the hard-shelled Sweet Almond has long been used in Europe and\r\nis found to make a hardy, strong stock in dry soils in California. The\r\nDamson and St. Julian plums have been used with varying satisfaction in\r\nmoist and heavy soils in America; and in Europe, these, with the Muscle\r\nand Pear plums, are common stocks for the peach. Peaches are dwarfed\r\nsomewhat by all plum-stocks. The Myrobalan plum, very commonly used for\r\nnearly all cultivated plums, was at one time recommended for the peach\r\nbut turned out to be very unsatisfactory and is now practically never\r\nused. The nectarine, Peento and Honey peaches are budded upon seedling\r\npeaches.\r\n\r\nA stock greatly desired in peach-growing is one that will dwarf the\r\ntree sufficiently so that winter-protection for buds and wood is\r\npracticable. The late E. S. Goff of Wisconsin tried for some years\r\nto find such a stock. He reports[257] working several hundred buds\r\non the dwarf Flowering-Almond without a single union. Better success\r\nattended efforts with the peach on the dwarf Sand Cherry, _Prunus\r\nbesseyii_, of the Rocky Mountains. Of the results, as he dismisses the\r\nflowering-almond, he says:\r\n\r\n\"I next tried a form of the Sand Cherry, grown from pits procured in\r\nwestern Iowa. This shrub is quite dwarf, attaining a height of only two\r\nor three feet. With this stock I have been more successful. I inserted\r\na few buds in it in 1893, and while I had less expectation of success\r\nthan with the Flowering Almond, I succeeded much better. The Peach\r\ngrew vigorously on this stock, and by the second year had attained the\r\nheight of about five feet. The past season, although the best growing\r\nseason we have had for some years, the Peach-trees on this stock have\r\nscarcely increased in height. They have branched rather thickly, and\r\nat present are well filled with flower-buds, from which I infer that\r\nthey will probably not grow larger than they now are. At this height\r\nthe trees are readily protected by digging away sufficient earth from\r\nthe roots, so that the trunk may be bent down readily, when the whole\r\nis covered with earth. The trees blossomed the past spring and set some\r\nfruit, though the fruit failed to mature.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same report, Professor Goff mentions trying _Prunus subcordata_\r\nand a dwarf form of _Prunus maritima_ as stocks for the peach but\r\nwith what success does not appear. Dwarf stocks for peaches offer an\r\ninvitation to experiment which it is hoped some one will accept. Such\r\nan experiment requires little more than land, time and material, for\r\nit is one of those cases in which nothing succeeds like success and\r\nnothing fails like failure so that he who runs would be able to read.\r\n\r\nTied up with stocks is another problem. Much is being said about the\r\nnecessity of selecting buds from trees having certain characters best\r\ndeveloped--as vigor or productiveness; large, handsome or well-flavored\r\nfruits; or immunity to some disease. As yet there is no body of facts\r\nto substantiate the claims of those who maintain that fruits can be\r\nimproved by bud-selection nor does present knowledge suggest that such\r\na procedure is a means of fruit-improvement. Quite to the contrary\r\nthe histories of varieties of peaches, as they may be read in this\r\ntext, suggest that, \"Like begets like,\" while in the light of science\r\na plant propagated by buds is essentially complete in its heredity.\r\nYet the whole question is still an open one and fruit-growers are\r\nwaiting to know whether putting buds through the sieve of selection is\r\nworth while. The advocates of improving orchards by bud-selection say\r\nlittle, however, about selecting stocks. There is nothing more certain\r\nthan that the stock greatly influences the character of the tree. The\r\nmodifications so brought about probably appear and disappear with the\r\nindividual--at least we should be the last in the world to hold that\r\npeaches could be permanently modified by the stocks. The point is, if\r\nbuds are selected for the tops, the stocks should be selected also. To\r\ndo otherwise is to imitate the ostrich--head in the sand, body exposed.\r\n\r\nThe peach is easy to propagate. Let it be said before going into\r\nthe matter, however, that practically all of the trees in the\r\npeach-orchards in New York were grown in nurseries and that it is\r\nprobably best to let the propagation of trees continue a business for\r\nthe specialist. Still, it is well that the grower know in a general\r\nway the operations in the propagation of the peach-tree. We wish, too,\r\nto put on record the nursery methods used in propagating this fruit at\r\nthis period in the history of the peach.\r\n\r\nIn planting peach-pits, art imitates and quickens nature. In nature the\r\nseeds are self-sown as they ripen, the succulent coat keeping the hard\r\nenvelope containing the kernel from becoming stony so that the young\r\nplant bursts forth at the proper season. But in cleaning and drying\r\nseeds for sale and transportation, they become hard and dry and must\r\nbe subjected to somewhat special treatment before planting. In mild\r\nclimates the pits are soaked or kept moist in sand, earth or other\r\nmedium until softened and are then planted in the fall in rows where\r\nthe trees are to be grown. In cold climates the stones are subjected to\r\nfreezing, thereby cracking them, after which the kernels are sown in\r\nthe spring. To freeze, the seeds are placed in strata with moist sand,\r\nsaw-dust, straw or other material supplying an abundance of moisture,\r\nand exposed to the freezing weather of winter which usually frees the\r\nkernel from its envelope. The kernels are then sifted from the stones\r\nand sand and sowed in rows four feet apart. Pits which the frost does\r\nnot open must be cracked by hand, though this tedious operation is\r\nusually omitted by large nurseries.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are planted in a rich, well-drained soil, preferably a light\r\nloam with good bottom. By late mid-summer in New York the stocks are\r\nready to bud, though often the operation extends into September. The\r\npeach is universally budded in America, grafting being most difficult,\r\nthough trees can be grown from root-cuttings. The method of budding\r\nis the common T, or shield-bud. The buds \"take\" in a week or two, but\r\nremain dormant until the next spring when the top of the stock above\r\nthe bud is removed to give the cion right of way. At one year from the\r\nbud, two years from the seed, in northern climates, the trees are ready\r\nto be transplanted in the orchard. In the South and on the Pacific\r\nSlope, budding may be done in June, thereby saving a season. These\r\n\"June buds,\" however, excepting under the most favorable conditions,\r\nin the East at least, are weaklings not nearly so desirable as \"summer\r\nbuds.\" Occasionally, more particularly in California, summer-budded\r\nstocks are planted in the fall or the next spring as \"dormant buds.\"\r\nIn New York, trees older than one year from the bud are seldom worth\r\nplanting though occasionally it is necessary to save stocks until their\r\nsecond season before budding.\r\n\r\nIn budding, the bud-sticks are cut as needed, after which the leaves\r\nare trimmed leaving about a quarter of an inch of the stem as a handle\r\nto the bud. After trimming, the sticks are wrapped in damp burlap and\r\nare taken to the field--once dried, they are worthless. The buds at\r\nthe end of the bud-stick are discarded, the plump, hard buds near the\r\nmiddle of the stick being the most vigorous. At the point where the\r\nbud is to be inserted a T-shaped incision is made, the transverse cut\r\nbeing secured by a rocking motion of the knife and the vertical one\r\nby lightly drawing the knife upward from a point about an inch below\r\nthe first cut. Before removing the knife a slight twist of the blade\r\nloosens the edges better to receive the bud.\r\n\r\nThe bud is cut from below upward with a drawing motion of the knife.\r\nNearly the entire thickness of the bark is cut at the point of the bud\r\nso that it will not crumple when inserted into the stock. Almost no\r\nwood is taken with the bud but on the other hand the bud must not be so\r\nthin that the soft growing tissue between the bark and wood is injured.\r\nThe bud is taken between the thumb and forefinger and lifted free from\r\nthe wood. With the leaf-stem as a handle the bud is inserted into the\r\nT-shaped incision and pushed down until its \"heel\" is flush with the\r\ntransverse cut. Waxing is not necessary but the bud must be securely\r\ntied.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose raffia is now almost universally used. It is cut into\r\nlengths of eighteen or twenty inches and moistened to make it soft and\r\npliable. The strand is first brought firmly across the upper end of\r\nthe bud to keep it from working out. Beginning then at the bottom of\r\nthe slit, the raffia is wound smoothly upward covering everything but\r\nthe \"eye\" and is tied in a single square knot. This winding must be\r\ntight to hold the bud immovably in place. In from two to four weeks,\r\ndepending on the growth of the stock, the raffia should be cut to\r\nprevent its girdling the tree.\r\n\r\nIn the nursery trade, peach-trees are graded according to caliper\r\nor according to height--rarely both since there is a very definite\r\nrelation between the two. The common sizes by caliper, or diameter of\r\nthe trunk, are five-, seven- or nine-sixteenths of an inch. According\r\nto height, the grades are \"three to four foot,\" \"four to five foot,\"\r\nor \"five to seven foot.\" The medium-sized grade is usually the best\r\nsince fewer trees die in transplanting, they are much easier to handle\r\nand, more important, provide a better opportunity for the grower to\r\nform the head as he wants it. The smallest grade often has many stunted\r\ntrees. A first-class tree is free from insects and fungi or the effects\r\nof either. Other things being equal, a short, stocky tree is better\r\nthan a tall, spindling one; one with many branches better than one\r\nwith few. The best stamp on a peach-tree, however, is a well-developed\r\nroot-system--many-branched, well-distributed, fibrous, fresh roots.\r\nPractically all peach-trees in New York are dug in the fall and kept in\r\nstorage through the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACH-ORCHARD AND ITS CARE\r\n\r\nThe peach-orchard is the consummation of modern fruit-growing. It is\r\nmore than a plantation of peach-trees, for it personifies ideals and\r\nreflects the personality of the owner. A glance at a peach-orchard\r\nand one knows whether the proprietor is lazy or industrious, slovenly\r\nor orderly, procrastinating or prompt. An orchard of dingy, unhappy\r\npeach-trees is an odious sight in the eyes of a good fruit-grower\r\naccustomed to nurturing and fondling his own trees. Tenants seldom\r\nsucceed in peach-growing. Here is a case in which Cato, the sturdy old\r\nRoman farmer, is surely right: \"The face of the master is good for the\r\nland.\" The peach in our climate is least able of all fruits to subsist\r\nwithout the aid of man. The best trees in the best soil, if neglected,\r\nhave a short, miserable and profitless existence. These considerations,\r\nthen, must bring us to the conclusion that growing peaches differs\r\nsomewhat from growing other fruits. If not more difficult it is at\r\nleast a finer and more delicate affair in which the laborer and\r\ncraftsman working by rule give way to men of higher degree who put\r\nthought, intelligence and taste into their work.\r\n\r\nNew York is very fortunate in having much land in all of its\r\npeach-districts that is easily prepared for planting. Growers are not\r\ncalled upon to profane the peach by planting it in a field of boulders\r\nas in New England nor amongst stumps as in some southern peach-regions.\r\nGrowers in the State long ago learned that it is an up-hill task to\r\ngrow the peach in land not thoroughly fitted at the start. Usually the\r\nland is prepared a year in advance by putting in a hoed crop, after\r\nwhich it is plowed deeply in the fall, pulverized thoroughly in the\r\nspring and then planted as promptly as possible. Fall-planting is not\r\npracticable because of severe losses following from winter-killing.\r\n\r\nThe peach-orchard is usually laid out in meridians and parallels in New\r\nYork at intervals of 18 by 18 or 20 by 20 feet, the former requiring\r\n134 and the latter 108 trees. The topography of the land sometimes\r\ngives preference to the triangular system of setting and rich soils\r\nor large growing varieties indicate greater distance while poor soils\r\nand small trees suggest closer planting. One thing certain, it is\r\npoor orcharding to set the trees too closely. Peaches picked in the\r\npleached alleys of a closely set orchard are few, small and poor in\r\nquality. Pride in appearance and convenience in working the trees make\r\nperfect alignment imperative. The peach readily self-pollinates so that\r\ninterplanting varieties is not practiced, but, rather, for convenience\r\nin harvesting, varieties are set in solid blocks, growers seldom,\r\nnowadays, planting more than three or four sorts. Laying out the land,\r\ndigging holes, trimming roots, setting trees are all kindergarten\r\noperations in fruit-growing, well understood by any one qualified to go\r\ninto peach-growing.\r\n\r\nAs to varieties, Elberta is now the mainstay of all the\r\npeach-districts, coming in as the mid-season crop. Greensboro, Carman,\r\nChampion, and Belle, all white-fleshed; and St. John, Fitzgerald,\r\nNiagara and Early Crawford, all yellow-fleshed, the two series named\r\nin order of ripening, are standard varieties preceding Elberta in\r\nthe markets. Standard sorts following are, Oldmixon Free, the only\r\nwhite-fleshed sort, and Crosby, Late Crawford, Kalamazoo, Chili, Smock\r\nand Salwey, these also named in order of maturity. A large number\r\nof new varieties are on probation in the State of which Arp, Lola,\r\nEdgemont, Rochester, J. H. Hale and Frances are now most conspicuous.\r\nThe peach-flora changes rapidly and many of these favorites of today\r\nwill be the cast-offs of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nIn the early life of the orchard, until bearing is well established,\r\nan inter-crop is a valuable asset in New York peach-orchards; on the\r\nother hand, planted in bearing orchards, any other crop than the\r\npeach is a heavy liability. While inter-cropping is not peculiar to\r\nNew York orchards it is probably more practiced in this State than in\r\nany other. Few, indeed, are the plantations in this region that do not\r\nsustain themselves for the first three or four years of their existence\r\non the crops grown between the trees. These are, or should be, hoed\r\ncrops like potatoes, cabbage, beans and cannery crops. He is a sloven,\r\nindeed, who would crop his peach-orchard with grass or grain. Along the\r\nHudson, small-fruits are looked upon as permissible, but are everywhere\r\ndiscountenanced in western New York.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the peach itself is planted as an inter-crop in\r\napple-orchards. The custom has little to recommend it and is not as\r\ncommon now as it was a few years ago. The objection to the peach as a\r\ncatch-crop in the apple-orchard is that serious complications arise\r\nin orchard-operations, the two fruits often requiring quite different\r\ntreatment in their care and, in spraying the apple, the peach is almost\r\ncertain to be more or less injured.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of cultivation, peach-growers are not in the fog that\r\nenvelopes and befuddles apple-growers in New York. The peach so\r\nluxuriates under thorough cultivation and, on the other hand, the\r\njaundiced leaves and hectic flush of the fruit speak so plainly of evil\r\ndays when the trees are in sod or unbroken ground that cultivation is\r\nuniversal. Cultivation, as practiced by the best growers, consists\r\nof plowing the land in the spring and then frequently stirring the\r\nsoil until late July or early August. The tools are as diverse as the\r\nkinds of soil. Whatever the details, the surface must be kept level,\r\ncovered with a dust-mulch and free from weeds. In soils that are light,\r\ntherefore hungry and thirsty, cultivation in the best orchards is\r\nalmost continuous. To do full duty in such a soil many men cultivate\r\nweekly. Disking is sometimes substituted for plowing but this is\r\nusually poor policy for the plow buries the mummied peaches that drop\r\nin every orchard to scatter countless myriads of spores of brown-rot\r\nand so perpetuate this plague of the peach-grower. Winter retreats\r\nso sullenly in New York that it is sometimes difficult to find time\r\nand weather for early spring plowing so that increasing numbers of\r\npeach-growers are plowing their orchards in the fall.\r\n\r\nThe cover-crop follows the last cultivation. There is a growing\r\nsuspicion in the State that the value of cover-crops in orchards\r\nhas been magnified. Comparative tests do not show that trees or\r\nsmall-fruits respond to cover-cropping to as great an extent as from\r\ntheory one might expect them to do. Thus, in several experiments being\r\nconducted by this Station, apples and grapes give no very appreciable\r\nresponse to the various cover-crops--at least pay but doubtfully for\r\nthe expense of seed and seeding. While there are no very satisfactory\r\nexperiments to confirm the assumption, it would seem, however, that\r\nthe peach of all fruits would be most benefitted by cover-crops. It is\r\npatent to all who have had orchard-experience that land is in better\r\ntilth when some green crop is turned under in fall or spring; so, too,\r\nall know that a cover-crop sowed in mid-summer causes the peach to\r\nmature its wood and thus go into the winter in better condition; it is\r\nnot unreasonable to assume, though it is impossible to secure reliable\r\nexperimental data to confirm the belief, that cover-crops protect the\r\nroots of peaches from winter-killing. Leaving out, then, the doubtful\r\nvalue of the cover-crop in furnishing plant-food to the peach, at least\r\nthree sufficient reasons make it a necessary adjunct of a peach-orchard.\r\n\r\nSeveral cover-crops are now in general use in the peach-orchards of New\r\nYork, in order of frequency of use about as follows: Clover, vetch,\r\noats, barley, cow-horn turnip, rape, rye, buckwheat. Combination\r\ncover-crops are less popular than formerly, cost of seed being the\r\ndeterrent. Yet many years of experience at this Station and wide\r\nobservation in the State, unsubstantiated, however, by any experimental\r\nwork, lead to the conclusion that some combination of a leguminous and\r\na non-leguminous crop makes the most satisfactory cover-crop for the\r\npeach. A half-bushel of oats or barley plus twenty pounds of winter\r\nvetch or twelve pounds of red clover is possibly the most satisfactory\r\nof all cover-crops for this fruit in New York. Occasionally a change\r\nfrom oats to barley, and clover to vetch should be made and once in\r\nfour or five years rape or cow-horn turnip should be worked into the\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of fertilizers, the peach-grower early learns humility.\r\nHe is no sooner certain that his trees must be fertilized and that\r\nhe has at last hit upon the right formula than his check plats or\r\nhis neighbor's orchard convince him that he is not getting the worth\r\nof his money in fertilizers. In eastern New York, peach-orchards are\r\nvery generally fertilized and rather heavily, the amounts and formulas\r\nbeing nearly as diverse as the men applying them. In western New York,\r\ncommercial fertilizers are comparatively little used in peach-orchards.\r\nExperiments in fertilizing peaches in progress at this Station are\r\ninconclusive and there is nothing to offer from the work here as to\r\nwhat the peach needs in the way of plant-food. In the present state\r\nof our knowledge, about the best the peach-grower can do is to assume\r\nthat, if his trees are vigorous, bearing well and making a fair amount\r\nof growth, they need no additional plant-food. If they are not in the\r\ncondition described, look to the drainage, tillage and health of the\r\ntrees first and the more expensive and less certain fertilization\r\nafterward. More and more, in western New York at least, growers are\r\ncarrying on simple experiments to obtain positive evidence as to what\r\nelements of plant-food their trees need.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of such an experiment: (1) Acid phosphate\r\nto give about 50 lbs. of phosphoric acid to the acre; (2) phosphate as\r\nabove and muriate of potash to give 100 lbs. of potash to the acre;\r\n(3) phosphate and muriate as above and nitrate of soda and dried blood\r\nto give 50 lbs. of nitrogen per acre; (4) six tons of stable manure is\r\napplied on a fourth plat; (5) a similar plat is left unfertilized for a\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nNo fallacy dies harder than that fertilizers will cure yellows. Nitrate\r\nof soda is a great rejuvenator of trees suffering from yellows brought\r\non by sod or lack of tillage but no fact in peach-orcharding has been\r\nmore thoroughly demonstrated than that neither this fertilizer nor any\r\nother will in the least benefit trees suffering from true yellows or\r\nfrom the somewhat similar trouble, little-peach.\r\n\r\nOf all fruit-trees, pruning is most used with the peach in regulating\r\nthe development of the tree. In its early years, we may almost say\r\nthat the peach \"lives by the knife.\" At all stages of growth the\r\nvigorous use of the knife is indispensable in keeping the peach in\r\nproper bounds, and yet, rather paradoxically, knife and saw must be\r\nused sometime or other in the life of every peach-orchard to stimulate\r\ngrowth or at least to force out new growths. Indispensable as a certain\r\namount of pruning is in training the peach, there is no question in\r\nthe minds of those who have studied the subject but that it is much\r\nmore often overdone than underdone. There are no fixed rules in pruning\r\npeaches and to discuss in full the diverse theories and practices is\r\nnot within the range of this exposition. All that can be attempted is\r\nbriefly to set down what the present practices are in the State.\r\n\r\nIn transplanting, the peach suffers severe root-pruning, an operation\r\nthat it does not bear well. Thus deprived of its roots, the young tree\r\nmust have its top correspondingly diminished. Two practices are in\r\nvogue in New York in this curtailment of the top as the trees go from\r\nthe nursery to the orchard. The most common practice is to cut the\r\nyoung tree back to a whip and then shorten-in the whip. New branches\r\nspring freely from this bare stub but these do not always come where\r\nthey are wanted and often the new wood comes only from the stock. These\r\nobjections to pruning to a whip have brought about a modification in\r\nwhich the branches are cut back to stubs of two or three buds. In a\r\nseries of experiments now in progress on the Station grounds it seems\r\ncertain that the second method is better than the first.\r\n\r\nTwo forms of top are open to choice--the vase-form, or open-centered\r\ntree, and the globe-form, or close-centered tree. In the first the\r\nframework of the tree consists of a short trunk, surmounted by four\r\nor five main branches ascending obliquely. In the second the trunk\r\nis continued above the branches, forming the center of the tree,\r\nand, later being headed in, a globe-like head is formed. In New York\r\nthe vase-form is nearly always chosen. In neither case is the task\r\ndifficult since the peach springs almost at once into tree-form with a\r\nfull complement of branches. Beginning with the second year the main\r\nbranches are shortened back from one-third to one-half their growth, if\r\nheading back seem necessary, cutting to upper and inner buds so that\r\nthe oblique ascending vase-form is maintained. The pruning of the third\r\nseason is much the same, except that some of the interior branches\r\nshould be removed to open up the heads to air and sunshine. The third\r\nseason's pruning is repeated from year to year, having in mind that\r\nthe slow-growing, hardy, productive sorts can be pruned much more\r\nseverely than the free-growing, tender kinds. Open forks are a serious\r\nmenace and are carefully avoided to lessen the danger of splitting when\r\nbranches are heavily laden. About the most common mistake is that of\r\ncutting out too much wood, thereby inducing so heavy a growth in the\r\nparts that remain that winter-killing takes place; at best it makes\r\nnecessary continued heavy pruning for several seasons to keep the trees\r\nin manageable size and shape.\r\n\r\nHeading-in as described in the foregoing paragraphs is necessary\r\nbecause the peach bears the bulk of its crop high up on its branches,\r\nwhich are often broken by the weight so that after a bountiful harvest\r\nthe orchard looks as if a cyclone had swept through it. As the limbs\r\nlengthen, too, it becomes increasingly difficult to pick the peaches.\r\nEven with annual heading-in the bearing wood eventually gets too far\r\nfrom the ground and the grower may have to resort to decapitating the\r\ntrees--an operation commonly known by the inapt term \"dehorning.\" When\r\nold trees are thus to be rejuvenated the limbs are sawed off during\r\nthe dormant season to within two feet or thereabouts of the trunk.\r\nThe tree will then form a new head which will in a season or two set\r\nfruit-buds and bear a crop. The orchard may thus very often be renewed\r\nor even re-renewed, lengthening its life by several seasons. In thus\r\ndecapitating trees, however, one season is always lost, sometimes two,\r\nand the writer questions if it is not better to give the peach a \"merry\r\nlife and a short one\" rather than resort to decapitation to prolong its\r\ndays. Most growers may well throw dehorning into the rubbish-heap of\r\nthe not-worth-while.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one sees in the State orchards in which the top is sheared\r\nto a level plane. This shearing follows a fashion, now happily going\r\nout, as it cannot come from any well-thought-out design. It takes but\r\na moment's study of the sheared tree to see the faults of the method.\r\nStrong shoots are cut back too much, weak ones not enough; superfluous\r\nshoots are not removed but, to the contrary, multiplied as in shearing\r\na hedge. Heading-in some or all of the shoots may be very necessary but\r\nshearing to a line--never.\r\n\r\nSummer-pruning is not practiced in New York peach-orchards. No doubt\r\nevery grower, however, as he goes about among his trees in the growing\r\nseason cuts back a branch outstripping its neighbors, removes an\r\noccasional unruly member or one out of place, pinches here and rubs\r\nthere, better to train his trees to the ideal he has in mind. Certainly\r\nno harm is done by such summer-pruning when the trees are strong and\r\nvigorous.\r\n\r\nThis record of pruning practices in New York cannot be closed\r\nwithout stating that there are growers who do not prune--not only\r\nthrough neglect but as a matter of principle. Chiefly, these are\r\nmen more accustomed to the other tree-fruits--most of which make a\r\nfair showing without pruning--than to the peach. The peach can go\r\na few years unpruned without becoming an abnormal orchard-specimen\r\nbut left to itself to the prime of life without the reinvigorating\r\nand form-giving knife a peach-orchard becomes a woeful spectacle.\r\nThe limbs crowd, choke and kill each other, except the strongest or\r\nthose most fortunately placed, which push aloft, bearing at their\r\nextremities sparse-foliaged, parasol-like canopies of jaundiced\r\nfoliage which furnish no protection from the blaze of the sun to the\r\nbare, bark-burned, gum-covered trunk and branches. The tree-tops are\r\npopulous with dead and dying twigs and do not furnish sufficient\r\nnutriment for the normal development of fruit or tree. These unpruned\r\npeach-orchards, come to old age, are the saddest sights of the country.\r\nAfter the first few crops, when the flush of vigor has passed, they\r\ncannot be profitable and it would seem the sooner the axe lays them low\r\nthe better for the owner. Not to prune the peach is consummate neglect.\r\n\r\nPeaches are thinned to improve the fruit that remains, to save the\r\nvigor of the tree, and destroy insect- or disease-infected fruits.\r\nCommendable as these objects are, the practice is all too seldom\r\nobserved in New York. The objections are scarcity and high cost of\r\nlabor. Still the best growers always thin, doing the work soon after\r\nthe summer drop which usually occurs six to eight weeks after the\r\nblossoming-time and just as the pits in the embryonic fruits begin\r\nto harden. It requires good judgment to tell at the time of thinning\r\nwhat will prove superfluity at the harvest. Vigor of tree, variety,\r\nfertility and moisture in the soil, the season, diseases and insects,\r\nall must be considered. The common advice is to thin the fruits so\r\nthat they will not be nearer together than from four to six inches\r\nbut the skillful growers adjust the size of the crop to the orchard\r\nand seasonal conditions. Thinning really begins, it should be said,\r\nin the winter when the trees are dormant and redundant branches and\r\nsuperfluous wood on the parts remaining are cut out. By delaying\r\nwinter-pruning until danger of winter-killing is passed many growers\r\nsave labor in summer-thinning, since, as early as this, fruit-prospects\r\nare fore-shadowed.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to record that peach-orchards are never top-grafted\r\nin New York though it seems to be a matter of rather frequent\r\npractice in the South and far West. There are plenty of occasions for\r\nworking over peach-trees in this State; as, when poor varieties are\r\nsubstituted, or in changes in fashion in peaches, or on finding a\r\nvariety poorly adapted to orchard-conditions. But under any of these\r\nunfortunate circumstances in New York the axe and the grub-hoe make\r\nway for a new planting rather than trust to the skill of the grafter.\r\nOld peach-trees can, of course, be either budded over or grafted over\r\nto a new variety but we take it that a century of experience has\r\ndemonstrated that changing the whole tree is better than changing the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING, MARKETING AND PROFITS\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the Twentieth Century is marked as a period in which\r\ncommercial affairs in agriculture are being more highly developed than\r\never before. Temporarily, the idea of making two blades of grass\r\ngrow where one grew before is eclipsed by the idea that success in\r\nagriculture is quite as much dependent on business management as on\r\nlarge production. We need, then, in _The Peaches of New York_ to set\r\ndown as precisely as possible, as a record of the times, the business\r\nside of peach-growing. This we conceive, so far as the fruit-grower\r\nis concerned, consists of matters having to do with growing, picking,\r\ngrading, packing, cooling and shipping, while the affairs of the\r\nseveral go-betweens from producer to consumer belong to merchanting\r\nrather than orcharding. Not that the grower is without interest in the\r\nselling of his products--far from it. There is no better ballast to\r\nkeep the fruit-dealer steady than knowledge of all of his dealings on\r\nthe part of the fruit-grower.\r\n\r\nAmong Caucasians green peaches have a bad reputation. Adage, prose\r\nand poetry bear witness that any curtailment of the sun's maturing\r\nfunction in this fruit is going against nature and makes an altogether\r\nunwholesome product. But in China and Japan the peach is habitually\r\neaten green and hard. Fungi play such havoc with peaches in Oriental\r\ncountries that the fruit must be devoured green or the crop is lost.\r\nA green peach is quite as palatable, nutritious and wholesome as a\r\ngreen olive. The ripe product of the one is just as superior to the\r\ngreen as is the other. All this not to point a moral or adorn a tale\r\nbut to bring out the fact that the green peach is an edible fruit and\r\nthat the annual performance of health inspectors in all large markets\r\nin condemning carloads of green peaches as unfit for food while green\r\nolives, apples, pears, plums, cherries and grapes pass muster, is an\r\nunjust discrimination against the peach. The peach is, of course, best\r\nwhen ripe, soft, melting and luscious, but so are all other fruits\r\nand all should be accorded the same treatment by consumers and health\r\ninspectors.\r\n\r\nThe peach in western countries is picked for market when it has\r\nattained full size and is passing from the hard state of the green\r\npeach to the softer mature condition. The picker tells by eye and by\r\npressure of the peach between thumb and finger when a peach is ready\r\nfor picking. White-fleshed peaches are green in color when picked\r\nbut turn to greenish-white or yellowish-white as maturity proceeds;\r\nyellow-fleshed turn from yellowish-green to lemon or orange-yellow.\r\nThe full flavor of the ripe peach develops only when the fruit ripens\r\non the tree but ripe fruit cannot be shipped and peaches are therefore\r\npicked at the stage in advance of full maturity that will permit them\r\nto reach the market at maturity--one or two days in New York, six or\r\nseven in California. Peach-picking is a delicate business for it is\r\nequally disastrous to gather the crop before it is ripe enough or to\r\ndelay a day or two too long.\r\n\r\nFew picking appliances are needed for the peach in New York since the\r\ntrees are trained so low most of the fruit can be picked from the\r\nground or from a short step-ladder. The knack of peach-picking consists\r\nof tipping the fruit sidewise with a light twist which releases it from\r\nthe branch without the bruise of a direct pull. The care in handling\r\ndepends largely on the temperament of the picker--a coarse, careless\r\nruffian cannot handle the tender-fleshed peach with the consideration\r\nit deserves. Women are much employed in picking peaches. Two systems of\r\nmanaging pickers are in vogue: They are employed by the day in charge\r\nof a competent foreman; or the picker is supplied with tickets or tally\r\ncards and is paid by the basket. The day-system is commonest and most\r\nsatisfactory. When peach-picking is in full swing a man can pick 100\r\nhalf-bushel baskets in a day of sorts like Elberta in which the fruits\r\nripen at the same time, but the quantity grows smaller and smaller as\r\nthe varieties decrease in size and increase in length of ripening-time.\r\nPeaches are usually graded and packed indoors, being brought under\r\ncover in special picking receptacles into which the fruit is put as\r\nit comes from the tree. Packing indoors is a comparatively modern\r\ninnovation, the method a decade or two ago being to pack in the field\r\nas is occasionally done now, more especially for local markets.\r\n\r\nGrading peaches is still a matter of local or personal practice in New\r\nYork as it is the country over. No state seems yet to have regulated by\r\nlaw the grading of peaches, as several have done with the apple. The\r\nneed is quite as great for such laws for one fruit as for the other,\r\nand no doubt grading peaches in New York will soon be regulated by the\r\nstrong arm of the law as is grading apples. The essentials in good\r\ngrading as now practiced are fair or large size for the variety, high\r\nand characteristic color, uniformity in size and color, freedom from\r\nbruises and insect and fungus injuries, and full and characteristic\r\nflavor for the variety. Peaches vary much in shape and pubescence\r\ndepending on soil and climate--so much that through variations in these\r\ncharacters the identity of varieties is sometimes lost--but grading is\r\nnot yet sufficiently refined to take note of either character. Good\r\ngrowers sort into at least three grades, counting culls.\r\n\r\nNot solely as a matter of record but to inspire further progress as\r\nwell, we record the fact that New York is behind the times in the\r\npackage used in sending peaches to market. The antiquated Delaware\r\npackage, a truncated cone holding a third- or a half-bushel, is now\r\nthe most popular package with growers. This package is a poor carrier,\r\nclumsy and easily tipped over, its sides are so thin that the fruit\r\nbruises, it is easily opened by thieves and it is unattractive. The\r\nreason for its popularity among growers may be guessed when its sole\r\nmerit is named--peaches need less sorting and are easily packed in this\r\nDelaware package. The grand jury of consumers, the country over, has\r\ndeclared for a smaller package for dessert peaches than the Delaware\r\ntruncated cone and a larger one for culinary peaches. Better in every\r\nway, and more and more used by growers in the State are the several\r\nsizes of climax baskets. The best of all peach-packages, the Georgia\r\ncarrier, is just coming into use in New York. It is a crate holding six\r\nfour-quart till-baskets. These till-baskets are dainty and attractive,\r\nfulfilling well the adage \"good goods come in small packages.\" The\r\nGeorgia carrier is conceded by all to hold the palm of merit for\r\nlong-distance shipments of dessert peaches. The bushel and half-bushel,\r\nround-bottom, farm type, the substantial cover supported by a stout peg\r\nbetween cover and bottom, are being more and more used for shipping the\r\nhome canning supply. In western New York the bushel basket, if not now,\r\npromises soon to be the most popular of all peach-packages.\r\n\r\nOur common commercial container, the Delaware basket, is seldom a\r\npacked package. The peaches are turned in, assorted somewhat as to\r\nsize, and the top layer faced with the red cheek up. The climax basket\r\nrequires more care in packing. The fruit must be arranged in layers\r\nand tiers according to the size of peach and basket. Skill and not\r\na little ingenuity are displayed in packing the dainty till-baskets\r\nfor the Georgia carrier, all depending on the size, uniformity and\r\nshape of the peach. The peaches are placed in rows and tiers which\r\nregularly alternate and cover much as in a box of packed apples. The\r\npeach-harvest in New York usually comes in pleasant weather so that the\r\npacking house is generally but a screen from the blaze of the sun, put\r\nup in the orchard. The packages, both before and after filling, are, of\r\ncourse, kept clean and dry under permanent cover.\r\n\r\nThe peach is so handsome and delectable, for that matter so pleasing\r\nto all of the senses, that every fruit-grower takes special pride in a\r\nfinely-finished product going to market and more often than with any\r\nother fruit advertises his wares with a label. These show original\r\nownership, where grown, often the variety, always the grade and\r\nusually advertise the whole farm and its product. Some growers have\r\ntheir labels registered in the United States Patent Office.\r\n\r\nNew York peach-growers profit more and more from cold-storage. Peaches\r\ncan be kept for a few weeks in storage at the freezing point or just\r\nabove but they soon lose texture and flavor on coming out and cannot\r\ncompete with fresh peaches which reach the markets every day from\r\nsome source from May until November. Precooling before shipment, now\r\nbut coming into practice, is of inestimable value in the heat of the\r\nsummer. The fruit is quickly packed and then cooled to 40° F. in a\r\ncentral station or by forcing cold air through loaded cars, and then\r\ngoes under refrigeration to destination. In eastern New York peaches\r\ngo mostly to New York City by night-boat but refrigerator service is\r\nan absolute necessity for western New York and has been very generally\r\ninstalled by the railroads of the region. The precooling station is to\r\nbe the next step in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE NEW YORK PEACH-CROP\r\n\r\nIn the past the great problems of peach-growers, as of those who grow\r\nother agricultural products, have been cultural in their essential\r\ncharacter. Attention to problems of distribution have had to do with\r\nthe opening up of new regions of production--the expansion of the\r\nagricultural domain; with developing means of transportation--railroad\r\nlines, steamboat service, canals; and in developing centers of\r\nconsumption in the cities and towns which have been springing up\r\neverywhere in the habitable parts of America. Until recent years,\r\nlittle has been done in studying the commercial disposition of\r\nagricultural products. Now, however, studies are being made everywhere\r\nof the distributive systems by which products get to market and to\r\ndetermine what share of the consumer's price should go to the producer\r\nand what to the distributor. Everywhere the importance of these\r\neconomic studies is recognized and no producer sees more clearly than\r\nthe New York peach-grower the need of improvement in handling products\r\nto distribute risks, reduce risks, decrease the numbers in the vast\r\narmies of middlemen and in every way improve defective distribution.\r\nBut these questions belong to specialists--economists. We wish here\r\nonly to furnish a few fundamental data which may be of use to all\r\nconcerned in the distribution of the peach-crop.\r\n\r\nIn the economic study of the peach-industry in the State it is\r\nessential to know the volume of the product in the State; what\r\nproportion of the total different sections produce; how the crop is\r\ndistributed in consumption; and the movement of the peach-crop from\r\ncompeting peach-states. These data we undertake to furnish for the year\r\n1915, a normal peach-year, taking the figures from the transportation\r\nlines handling peaches in New York so far as obtainable. The volume of\r\nthe product for western New York is shown by figures taken from the New\r\nYork Central Railroad[258] and the Lehigh Valley Railroad. Peaches were\r\nshipped from towns as follows:\r\n\r\n  Adams Basin      26 Cars\r\n  Albion           41  \"\r\n  Appleton        108  \"\r\n  Ashwood          19  \"\r\n  Barker          261  \"\r\n  Barnard          72  \"\r\n  Brice            24  \"\r\n  Brighton          3  \"\r\n  Brockport       116  \"\r\n  Buffalo           2  \"\r\n  Burt            244  \"\r\n  Carlton          25  \"\r\n  Caywood          16  \"\r\n  Charlotte        88  \"\r\n  Covert           21  \"\r\n  E.

From reports received from the\r\nchief Hudson River navigation lines it would seem that they probably\r\ncarried about one hundred carloads.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the 600 carloads grown in eastern New York were\r\nconsigned to New York City or nearby towns. From the above table we\r\nmay assume that about 5000 carloads were produced in the rest of the\r\nState and we are fortunate in having a record as to where 4419 of these\r\nwere consigned. The New York Central Railroad distributed the number of\r\ncarloads named as follows:[259]\r\n\r\n  _No. of_  _Percentage_                                           _No._\r\n   _Cars_    _of Crop_                 _Destination_             _Towns_\r\n\r\n  1,628     36    Buffalo and points west, including Pittsburgh       96\r\n    906     20    Pennsylvania and points south of Newberry Junction  72\r\n    222      5    Points east of Albany                               25\r\n    986     22.3  Points north of New York City                      145\r\n    677     15.7  New York City                                        1\r\n  -----                                                              ---\r\n  4,419                                                              339\r\n  =====                                                              ===\r\n\r\nAnalyzing these figures we find that the 4,419 carloads reached 339\r\ndestinations grouped as follows:[260]\r\n\r\n    9 cities took 2,378 cars, over one-half of the crop,\r\n\r\n   21 cities took 3,018 cars, two-thirds of the crop,\r\n\r\n   59 cities took from 4 to 10 cars each,\r\n\r\n  231 cities took from 1 to 3 cars each,\r\n\r\n   62 per cent of the crop went outside of the State,\r\n\r\n   22.3 per cent went to points in New York north of New York City,\r\n\r\n   15.7 per cent went to New York City\r\n\r\nThe nine cities which took over one-half of the crop are:\r\n\r\n  New York          677 Cars\r\n  Pittsburgh        555  \"\r\n  Philadelphia      418  \"\r\n  Cleveland         156  \"\r\n  Boston            135  \"\r\n  Cincinnati        116  \"\r\n  Syracuse          109  \"\r\n  Columbus          109  \"\r\n  Detroit           103  \"\r\n                  ----------\r\n      Total       2,378 Cars\r\n                  ==========\r\n\r\nWhile these nine cities took over one-half the 1915 peach-crop,\r\ntwenty-one cities took 3,018 carloads. In addition to those already\r\nnamed, these cities are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Newark, N.

On the other hand, keeping\r\naccounts in peach-growing is not as difficult and complicated as\r\nin growing other fruits. The peach is not as long-lived, barring\r\naccidents the trees bear more regularly, the crop is quickly disposed\r\nof, orchard-operations among growers are more uniform, and, no doubt,\r\nthe very fact that the peach partakes so much of speculation makes\r\ngrowers a little keener on striking balances at the end of the season.\r\nAt any rate there is a great body of material in the reports of the\r\nhorticultural societies in New York on costs in peach-growing and from\r\nthese data, together with notes taken for several years, we venture to\r\nestimate the present costs per acre of the several items entering into\r\npeach-production. To attempt to go further and calculate profits, with\r\nall of the inconstant factors of yields and markets, would be guessing\r\npure and simple.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the cost of production in a ten-acre orchard. This\r\nunit is now, however, rather too small, for more and more growers are\r\ngiving up general farming, finding peach-growing an exacting, full-time\r\nvocation. Often enough it is successfully combined with the growing of\r\nother fruits, but less and less so with the growing of farm-crops. The\r\nfirst item in cost of production is interest on investment. What value\r\nis to be placed on a New York peach-orchard?\r\n\r\nThe value must be calculated from the cost of land and trees and\r\nthe labor and the deferred dividends until the orchard comes into\r\nprofitable bearing. Selling price is never a safe gauge with the\r\npeach, sales usually being made under conditions more abnormal than\r\nin almost any other phase of farming and showing great variability\r\nin every locality. Suppose we place the value at $400 per acre, a\r\nsum sufficiently high to cover, besides the cost of the orchard, the\r\noverhead expenses of houses and barns that would fall to ten acres of\r\na New York farm. Interest now runs at five percentum so that the first\r\nexpense item is $20.00 per acre on investment. Assessment rates on land\r\nso valued would bring taxes up to $1.00 per acre.\r\n\r\nThe equipment needed to care for a peach-orchard is quite uniform the\r\nState over and the cost of the several items varies scarcely at all,\r\nso that a very close approximation may be made of the total cost. The\r\nitems run about as follows: Team and harness at present price, $500;\r\nspraying outfit, $250; wagon, plow, harrow, ladders, crates, pruning\r\ntools, etc., $250; total, $1,000. These figures are below the mark\r\nrather than above but the instances are few in which the equipment\r\nitemized would be used exclusively for a ten-acre peach-orchard; in\r\nfact, with this equipment thirty acres could be cared for. It is not\r\ntotal cost, however, but depreciation and interest on money with which\r\nwe are concerned. Setting these at 20 percentum, we have $20.00 per\r\nacre to charge to maintenance of equipment.\r\n\r\nYear in and year out, tillage is the most costly ingredient in the\r\nmaking of a good peach-orchard. It consists of plowing once a year,\r\nfall or spring, and harrowing on the average at least ten times a\r\nseason. High cost of labor brings this item up to $10.00 per acre which\r\nincludes seeding the cover-crop but not the cost of seed, for which an\r\nadditional charge of $2.50 must be made for a combination crop of red\r\nclover and oats or of vetch and barley.\r\n\r\nIt would seem easiest of all to ascertain the cost of fertilizers for\r\nthe peach but the practices are so diverse and fertilizers are applied\r\nso irregularly by those who use them at all that the data at hand are\r\nalmost worthless. Those who plow under cover-crops regularly, spend\r\nlittle for fertilizers; an occasional dressing of stable manure answers\r\nfor fertilization with many; still more, so uncertain of results\r\nas to feel they are \"buying a pig in the poke,\" spend nothing for\r\nfertilizers. We shall enter a charge of $5.00 per acre for fertilizers\r\nthough this is without question above the average even if only\r\nsuccessful orchards be considered.\r\n\r\nA more certain charge is that for pruning. The problems in pruning are\r\nmore of the mind than the hand and once the work is laid out it goes\r\nalong rapidly. An acre-average of $3.00 is sufficient to cover the\r\nexpense of pruning and thinning may be done, year in and year out, at\r\nthe same cost.\r\n\r\nThe peach-orchard is customarily sprayed but once in New York, an\r\napplication of the lime-sulphur wash being made to prevent leaf-curl\r\nand to destroy San Jose scale. The cost of this single spray cannot\r\nbe more than $4.00 per acre but to this must be added a charge for\r\nprotection against mice and rabbits, destruction of borers and cutting\r\nout trees infected with yellows or little-peach, averaging, all told,\r\nat least $8.00 for keeping under pests.\r\n\r\nThe services of a peach-grower are worth more than the time of the\r\nmen who do the actual labor. It is but fair, then, that an allowance\r\nbe made for superintending the work. Since a competent orchardist can\r\nsuperintend a farm enterprise of several times the magnitude of a\r\nten-acre orchard, but part can be allowed for superintendence, $300 for\r\nthe season being a fair price, or $30.00 per acre.\r\n\r\nPicking, grading, packing and hauling are all operations that cost\r\nno two men the same for any one. Without attempting to segregate\r\nthese items an approximation of the total cost of all, based on a\r\nconsiderable amount of data, is $30.00 per acre. This sum does not\r\ninclude the cost of packages.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a summary of the cost sheet in growing the average\r\nacre of peaches:\r\n\r\n  Interest on investment                      $20.00\r\n  Taxes                                         1.00\r\n  Depreciation in equipment and interest       20.00\r\n  Tillage                                      10.00\r\n  Cover-crop seed                               2.50\r\n  Fertilizers                                   5.00\r\n  Pruning and thinning                          6.00\r\n  Keeping pests under                           8.00\r\n  Superintendence                              30.00\r\n  Picking, grading, packing and hauling        30.00\r\n                                             -------\r\n                                             $132.50\r\n                                             =======\r\n\r\nPushing this calculation further, the cost per tree runs at $1.32-1/2,\r\nthere being 100 trees to the acre in the average orchard in the State.\r\nPeach-growers expect 150 bushels per acre during the bearing time of\r\nthe peach, and dividing 132.50 by 150 we have 88-1/3 cents as the\r\naverage cost, exclusive of the package, per bushel of peaches in\r\nNew York. In this calculation it is assumed that the peach comes in\r\nprofitable bearing at five years after setting and that the orchard is\r\non the home stretch in the fifteenth lap, giving ten bearing seasons,\r\nat least three of which will be fruitless.\r\n\r\nPeach-growers to whom this cost sheet has been submitted say 88\r\ncents is too high a cost for producing a bushel of peaches but asked\r\nto consider the several items agree that most of them are too low.\r\nNo doubt few who figure the cost of production include the item of\r\nsuperintendency which increases the cost for each bushel 20 cents.\r\nSo, too, the average yield given is considered high. Granting that\r\nthey may be high, all of the figures are permitted to stand, on the\r\ntheory that the yield bears a close relationship to the expense of\r\nproduction--increased costs stand for increased yields. In tabulations\r\nof this kind much is usually made of the cost of bringing the orchard\r\nin bearing. In this calculation the high charge of investment goes to\r\ncover the cost of the first five years, the period of incubation, so\r\nto speak, and it is certain that this, with the sale of inter-crops,\r\ncovers all expenditures for the first five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE PEACH\r\n\r\nThe peach is attacked by a half-score or more diseases in New York,\r\ntwo of which, yellows and little-peach, have this fruit quite at\r\ntheir mercy, there being no preventive, antidote, nor means of\r\nalleviation for either. Two other diseases, brown-rot and leaf-curl,\r\nare always present and often bring disaster, their virulency depending\r\non locality, season, weather and variety, but both are amenable to\r\ntreatment and at most destroy only foliage and fruit, while yellows and\r\nlittle-peach take their toll in trees. The several other diseases to be\r\ndiscussed are either easily controlled or are of minor importance.\r\n\r\nYellows is a malignant disease or condition of the peach, very\r\ncontagious, usually virulent, of which we know neither cause, origin\r\nnor cure. We know only its unmistakable symptoms, its terrible\r\nconsequences. The history of yellows, the circumstances of its coming\r\nand its effects have been given in a foregoing chapter so that we need\r\nto discuss now only the symptoms and means of preventing the direct\r\nresults of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn its later stages the symptoms are characteristic enough and cannot\r\nbe confounded with those of any other malady or condition of the\r\ntree. The marks of yellows are: (1) Premature ripening of the fruit\r\naccompanied by red blotches over the surface and red streaks running\r\nthrough the flesh; (2) premature unfolding of leaf-buds into willowy\r\ngrowths of tips and the production of shoots upon the trunk or main\r\nbranches with growths developing into bunchy tufts of yellow or reddish\r\nfoliage; (3) total discoloration of the foliage.\r\n\r\nPrematureness in ripening varies from a few days to several weeks;\r\nthe earlier it occurs, the smaller the fruit. When diseased fruit\r\nripens near the normal season the peaches may be full size, showy to\r\nvoluptuousness and marked outwardly only by the hectic red of the\r\ndisease. The taste indicates the disease--in insipid, mawkish or bitter\r\nspecimens which show the red color and undersize of prematured peaches.\r\nDuring the first season prematured fruit may show only on particular\r\nbranches or even on a single shoot which may not differ in appearance\r\nfrom other parts of the tree. Prematureness, unaccompanied by other\r\nsymptoms of yellows, may be due to borers, drought, neglect, girdling\r\nor similar causes.\r\n\r\nThe second symptom is the opening of winter-buds out of season.\r\nThis usually occurs a year later than the appearance of prematured,\r\nred-colored fruits. The buds may push forth shortly after they have\r\nformed in mid-summer while the tree-top is still bearing its fruit\r\nand foliage or they may delay until the next spring, to appear a few\r\ndays in advance of normal leafing-time. Very often these buds begin\r\ngrowth in the autumn after healthy leaves have fallen. Such diseased\r\nbuds may develop on tips of branches, especially water-sprouts, but\r\nfeeble, sickly shoots due to the disease usually appear in considerable\r\nnumbers on main limbs and on the trunk, no doubt under the influence of\r\nthe yellows on old resting buds buried deep in the bark of the wood.\r\nSometimes these yellow shoots are unbranched but oftener they are much\r\nbranched and frequently but bunchy tufts of foliage, stems slender,\r\nleaves pale green, small, narrow and standing out stiffly at nearly\r\nright angles to the stems.\r\n\r\nIn the final stage of the disease the trees assume the yellowish leaves\r\nwhich give name to the trouble, though sometimes the yellow is tinged\r\nwith red. Yellows is an unfortunate name since so many other troubles\r\nof the peach cause the foliage to take on the jaundiced appearance of\r\nthis disease. The third stage marks the beginning of the end--sometimes\r\nthree years, sometimes five or six, but always death sooner or later,\r\nthere being no instance on record of a diseased tree having been cured.\r\n\r\nThis, in brief, is the usual course of yellows, but it follows no\r\ninvariable rule in its development. Yellows is known to be spread as\r\na contagion by affected buds in nursery stock, by nursery-trees, by\r\norchard-trees, and may even be communicated by pits from affected\r\ntrees. That it must be caused or transmitted in still other ways is\r\napparent to all who have had experience with the disease. It seems\r\nnot, however, to linger in the soil, for trees may be set in the very\r\nspots from whence diseased plants have been removed without danger to\r\nthe newcomer. \"War to the knife and the knife to the hilt\"--absolute\r\nextermination, root and branch, by ax and fire, is the only known\r\nmethod of subduing yellows.\r\n\r\nLittle-peach is possibly a variant of peach-yellows or, at least,\r\nis very similar in nature. It seems to have been described first in\r\nMichigan in the early nineties of the last century but had attacked\r\norchards in New York before that time so that it is now impossible to\r\nsay where it first appeared. Be that as it may, the disease is not now\r\nthe exclusive possession of either state but in the twenty years of its\r\nhistory has become as widely distributed as yellows, covering about\r\nthe same territory, and seems now to be equally destructive. Outwardly\r\nthe disease differs from yellows chiefly: (1) In delayed rather than\r\npremature ripening of the under-sized fruits of little-peach; (2) the\r\nleaves usually show more green than in yellows and show a decided\r\ntendency to droop or roll; (3) little-peach, as a rule, appears later\r\nin the season than yellows; (4) the characteristic, sickly, wiry shoots\r\nof yellows are seldom present in little-peach. Little-peach is kept at\r\nbay, as in yellows, by extermination of affected trees.\r\n\r\nRosette, though distinct in most of its symptoms from yellows and\r\nlittle-peach, is clearly similar in nature, is just as virulent and\r\ncontagious, is communicated in the same ways and requires the same\r\ntreatment. On trees affected with rosette the fruits shrivel and drop\r\nand tufts or rosettes of leaves develop freely. Rosette is not found in\r\nNew York nor north of the Potomac and hence is of but passing interest\r\nto peach-growers in this State.\r\n\r\nBrown-rot (_Sclerotinia fructigena_ (Persoon) Schroeter), known also as\r\nfruit-mold and ripe-rot, attacks flowers and shoots of the peach, but\r\nis most conspicuous on the ripe or ripening fruits. Here its presence\r\nis quickly detected by a dark discoloration of the skin which is\r\nafterwards partly or wholly covered with pustule-like aggregations of\r\ngray spores. The decayed fruits fall to the ground or more often hang\r\nto the tree, becoming shriveled mummies, each mummy being a storehouse\r\nof fungus threads and spores from which infestation spreads to the\r\nnext crop. The rot spreads with surprising rapidity on the fruits in\r\nwarm, damp weather either before the fruit is picked or in baskets\r\nwhile being shipped or stored. Preventive remedies have so far met\r\nwith but indifferent success; probably the best method of control is\r\nto destroy the mummy-like fruits and all other sources of infection\r\neither by picking them from the trees, or much better by plowing them\r\nunder deeply. Even so it is impossible to exterminate all of the\r\ncountless myriads of brown-rot spores. Spraying with the self-boiled\r\nlime-sulphur mixture three times at intervals of three weeks, beginning\r\nas the calyxes drop, is the appointed preventive but the results are\r\nuncertain, as this is one of the diseases in which it is difficult to\r\ntouch the spot in spraying. Varieties of peaches show various degrees\r\nof susceptibility to brown-rot.\r\n\r\nPeach leaf-curl (_Exoascus deformans_ (Berk.) Fuckel) is the best-known\r\nand probably the most prevalent fungus disease of the peach in New\r\nYork. The disease appears in early spring as the leaves unfold and\r\ncontinues until warm, dry, summer weather prevails. The name describes\r\nthe disease so that all may know it--the leaves curl, then become\r\npuckered, distorted and much thickened, turn from normal green to\r\nyellow, tinged with red, and finally fall. In severe cases the trees\r\nmay be defoliated, though a second covering of leaves almost always\r\ncomes out. Leaf-curl is most prevalent and most virulent in cool,\r\nmoist weather. The disease is easily controlled by spraying with\r\nlime-sulphur, bordeaux mixture or any other good fungicide applied\r\nwhile the trees are dormant.\r\n\r\nIn common with other species of Prunus the foliage of peaches is\r\nattacked by several fungi which produce diseased spots on the\r\nleaves, the dead areas usually dropping out leaving holes as if\r\npunctured by shot, giving the names \"shot-hole fungus,\" \"leaf-spot\"\r\nand \"leaf-blight.\" Two fungi are in the main responsible for these\r\nleaf-troubles, _Cylindrosporium padi_ Karsten and _Cercospora\r\ncircumscissa_ Saccardo. The ravages of these fungi are prevented by the\r\nuse of the self-boiled lime-sulphur mixture. With these, as with other\r\nfungi, cultivation has a salutary effect as it destroys diseased leaves\r\nwhich harbor the fungi during their resting period and keeps the trees\r\nvigorous enough to resist the fungi.\r\n\r\nPeach-scab (_Cladosporium carpophilum_ Thüm.) is a common and\r\ndestructive fungus in peach-growing districts on the Atlantic seaboard\r\nand is found rather frequently in New York but seldom does much injury\r\nin the State. It appears in sooty, black spots and blotches on the\r\nsurface of the peach, causing atrophy and hardening of the parts\r\naffected which, in severe cases, crack badly. Twigs and leaves may be\r\naffected. White-fleshed sorts suffer most and are ruined for the market\r\neven in mild attacks. Self-boiled lime and sulphur, if it does not\r\nwholly prevent infections, at least alleviates the trouble.\r\n\r\nPeach-growers in New York are much plagued by a mildew yet suffer\r\nsmall loss from it, though the disease greatly injures peach-foliage\r\nin some regions. The delicate, white or grayish powder, giving the\r\nname \"powdery mildew,\" consists of the spores and mycelium of a\r\nfungus (_Sphærotheca pannosa_ (Wallroth) Léveillé) which attacks the\r\nleaves of several species of Prunus causing them to curl and crinkle\r\nand sometimes to drop. It occurs most often when there are sudden\r\nchanges in temperature. When treatment is necessary, the self-boiled\r\nlime-sulphur mixture is used.\r\n\r\nIn common with all tree-fruits, the peach is attacked by crown-gall\r\n(_Bacterium tumefaciens_ Smith and Townsend). In New York crown-gall\r\nseldom greatly injures old trees but nursery plants are sometimes\r\ngirdled by the galls, seriously injuring them. Badly diseased young\r\nplants, therefore, should not be planted. The galls are tumor-like\r\nstructures, usually at the juncture of top and root, which vary from\r\nthe size of a pea to that of a large egg, forming at maturity rough,\r\nknotty, dark-colored masses. Neither preventive nor cure is known.\r\nPlanting diseased trees is not a safe practice, nor should the peach\r\nbe set in ground known to have recently had trees badly infected. The\r\nraspberry is a common carrier of crown-gall and should not be planted\r\nas an inter-crop in a peach-orchard.\r\n\r\nThe peach suffers more or less from an excessive flow of gum. This\r\ngumming is usually a secondary effect of injuries caused by fungi,\r\nbacteria, insects, frost, sunscald, and mechanical agencies. There\r\nis a good deal of difference in the susceptibilities of varieties to\r\nthis trouble, sorts having hard wood suffering less than those having\r\nsoft wood. There is less gumming, too, on trees in soils favoring\r\nthe maturity of wood, under conditions where sun and frost are not\r\ninjurious, and, obviously, in orchards where by good care the primary\r\ncauses of the diseases are kept out.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS ATTACKING THE PEACH\r\n\r\nThe peach has its full share of troublesome insects, entomologists\r\nlisting about forty species, at least half of which are either\r\ndestructive or annoying in New York. The peach cannot undergo hardships\r\nand once it is beset by parasites, it does not prosper. No small\r\npart of the peach-grower's time, therefore, is spent in combating\r\nthe insect-pests of his trees. The several pestiferous species vary\r\ngreatly in importance, the peach-borer probably holding first place in\r\ndestructiveness.\r\n\r\nThe peach-borer (_Sanninoidea exitiosa_ Say) is probably the commonest\r\nand is certainly the most ancient enemy of the peach in America. It\r\nis found everywhere east of the Rocky Mountains and, since it is a\r\nnative, its natural host being the wild species of Prunus, it has been\r\na parasite on the peach from the earliest introduction of this fruit.\r\nAll in all, it is the most destructive insect-pest of the peach, its\r\npresence always endangering the life of the tree. All peach-growers\r\nknow the peach-borer. It is a white, grub-like caterpillar with a\r\nyellowish, shield-like head, which lives and feeds in the trunk of\r\nthe peach just below the surface of the ground, eating out irregular\r\nchambers and galleries underneath the bark, sometimes girdling the\r\ntrees. The pest is easily discovered through the exudation from the\r\ninfested part of gum mixed with borings and excreta. The borers are\r\nfound at all times in the summer, usually very small in late summer\r\nand autumn but an inch or more in length in early summer. The borer\r\nis a larva of a wasp-like moth which lays its eggs in early summer;\r\nthese hatch in from seven to ten days and the minute borers work their\r\nway into the tree. The moth may be deterred somewhat from depositing\r\nher eggs by thorough cultivation, mounding the trees and, according\r\nto some, by the use of obnoxious coverings or poisonous washes on the\r\ntrunk. Preventive measures are seldom sufficiently effective, however,\r\nand the borers must be destroyed. This is best done by digging them out\r\nwith a knife or wire--\"worming\" in the parlance of the peach-grower.\r\n\r\nThe lesser peach-borer (_Sesia pictipes_ Grote & Robinson) is rather\r\ninfrequently found infesting the peach in New York. It usually attacks\r\nonly old trees or those showing injury from freezing or other causes.\r\nThe borer is much like the common peach-borer, described in the\r\nforegoing paragraph, but is smaller, seldom reaching the length of\r\nfour-fifths of an inch. Unlike the true borer, it infests the trunks\r\nas well as the crowns of peach-trees, feeding in much the same way.\r\nFortunately the pest is not common in the State, for it is rather\r\ndifficult to control, since not only the crown but the trunk must be\r\nreached in worming for the pest.\r\n\r\nThe plum-curculio (_Conotrachelus nenuphar_ Herbst) is sometimes a\r\ntroublesome pest of the peach. It is a rough, grayish, hump-backed\r\nsnout-beetle somewhat less than a quarter of an inch in length, an\r\ninsect so familiar to fruit-growers as hardly to need description. The\r\nfemale beetle pierces the skin of the young peaches and places an egg\r\nin the puncture. About this cavity she gouges out a crescent-shaped\r\ntrench, the puncture and trench making the star and crescent of the\r\nOttoman Empire, hence the common name, \"Little Turk.\" The egg-laying\r\nprocess may be repeated in a number of fruits and from each egg a larva\r\nhatches within a week and burrows to the stone, making a wormy fruit.\r\nMost of the infested fruits drop. Poisoning with an arsenate is the\r\nchief means of combating the pest. Rubbish and vegetation offer hiding\r\nplaces and hibernating quarters for the insects and hence cultivated\r\norchards are most free from curculio. The thin-skinned nectarines are\r\ndamaged most by the insect but peaches are attacked rather freely.\r\nEarly peaches suffer much more than late ones from curculio; thus,\r\nof standard sorts in New York, Greensboro and Carman are usually\r\ninjured more or less while Salwey and Chili seldom show a puncture.\r\nThe plum-orchard is usually the source of supply of curculio and early\r\npeaches ought not, therefore, be set with or near plums.\r\n\r\nSan Jose scale (_Aspidiotus perniciosus_ Comstock) is as harmful to\r\npeaches as to any other tree-fruit. The insect is now so well known\r\nin all fruit-growing regions as scarcely to need description. It is\r\nusually first recognized by its work, evidence of its presence being\r\ndead or dying twigs--oftentimes the whole tree is moribund. Examination\r\nshows the twigs or trees to be covered with myriads of minute scales,\r\nthe size of a small pin-head, which give the infested bark a scurfy,\r\nashy look. If the bark be cut or scraped, a reddish discoloration is\r\nfound. Leaves and fruit as well as bark are infested, the insidious\r\npest, however, usually first gaining a foothold on the trunk or a\r\nlarge branch. Reproduction is continuous throughout the summer in this\r\nclimate so that the insects multiply by leaps and bounds. The peach,\r\npossibly, succumbs more quickly than any other fruit, three years\r\nsufficing for the destruction of a young orchard if the pest be brought\r\nin on nursery stock. The rougher-barked, older trees resist longer and\r\nsuffer less injury. Still, old orchards are irretrievably ruined in\r\none or two seasons of unrestricted breeding. Peach-growers, in common\r\nwith all fruit-growers, find the lime-sulphur solution applied in the\r\ndormant season the most effective spray in combating this insect.\r\nThere are several insect-enemies of the scale that are valuable allies\r\nand entomologists say that the insects seem more susceptible to the\r\nclimatic condition of the country than formerly but still natural\r\nchecks are far from sufficient and the peach-grower should quickly\r\nattack with the spray-nozzle at the first appearance of scale.\r\n\r\nBesides the San Jose there are several other scales more or less\r\nabundant in New York orchards, two of which make the peach their\r\nfavorite host. These are the West Indian peach-scale (_Aulacaspis\r\npentagona_ Targioni) and the Peach-Lecanium (_Eulecanium\r\nnigrofasciatum_ Pergande). Neither, however, is very troublesome as far\r\nnorth as New York and both are kept well under control by the treatment\r\nfor the more common San Jose. The Lecanium is responsible for the\r\ndiscolored, sooty peaches occasionally found in parts of the State;\r\nfor, though the discoloration is caused by a soot-fungus, the fungus\r\nlives in the honey-dew of the scale.\r\n\r\nThe black peach-aphis (_Aphis persicæ-niger_ E. F. Smith) is sometimes\r\na serious pest in light peach-soils in New York but is not nearly as\r\ntroublesome here as it is in states having a larger proportion of\r\nsandy land since it seems to find life easiest in light, warm soils.\r\nThe insect is an intensely black, shining louse with brownish legs.\r\nIt lives underground more than above ground, maintaining itself for\r\nmost part on the tender roots of newly set or nursery trees, being\r\nfound only occasionally on shoots and foliage. An expert eye detects\r\nthe presence of the lice by the sparse and jaundiced foliage of young\r\ntrees which an untrained eye would say were down with incipient\r\nyellows--indeed countless numbers of young trees have been sacrificed\r\nto the yellow's pyre when they suffered only from lice on the roots.\r\nThe pest is easily detected on stock received from nurseries--the chief\r\nsource of infestation--and the trees may be dipped or fumigated as for\r\nSan Jose scale, thus completely exterminating the aphids. Good culture\r\nand a dressing of some fertilizer will help to carry young orchards\r\nthrough an infestation though treatment to a dose of a pound of ground\r\ntobacco stems worked in the soil about the roots may be necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is, too, a green plant-louse (_Myzus persicae_ Sulzer) more or\r\nless common on peaches in the State every season. It is very similar in\r\nappearance to the green aphis of the apple and other plants and makes\r\nits presence known by much the same effect on the leaves. It works on\r\nthe underside of the leaves along the veins, causing the leaves to\r\npucker, curl and crinkle much as with leaf-curl. This green louse,\r\nhowever, is seldom numerous or harmful enough on peaches to require\r\ntreatment. Should treatment be required, no doubt nicotine, now the\r\nstandard remedy for aphids on foliage, would keep the pest under.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-tree bark-beetle (_Eccoptogaster rugulosus_ Ratzeburg), known\r\nin New York as the shot-hole borer, is often a serious menace to old\r\nor decrepit peach-trees. The beetle is a small, cylindrical insect an\r\neighth of an inch long, one-third as wide, the body uniformly black and\r\nthe surface closely and deeply pitted and punctured, the punctures on\r\nthe wing-covers arranged in rows. Injury to the peach by this insect is\r\nfirst indicated by exudation of gum from trunk and branches and later\r\nby numerous small, round holes as if the tree had been struck by shot.\r\nHealthy, vigorous trees are seldom attacked and if so the larvae do not\r\ndevelop, but a peach-tree suffering a decline from any cause whatsoever\r\nis open to immediate attack and once the pest gains foothold the plant\r\nis doomed. Here, indeed, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of\r\ncure, for keeping the orchard constantly in healthy, vigorous condition\r\nto avoid accidental introduction, and prompt removal and destruction\r\nof infested trees, both preventive measures, constitute the only\r\nsatisfactory treatment.\r\n\r\nThe peach twig-borer (_Anarsia lineatella_ Zell.) imported from Europe,\r\nhas at times been a troublesome pest of the peach in parts of the\r\nUnited States but causes little injury in New York. Still, it can be\r\nfound every year in nearly every peach-district in the State and needs,\r\ntherefore, to be guarded against since it may some time appear in\r\nsufficient numbers to become formidable. The adult is a moth the larva\r\nof which is about one-half inch long, pinkish in color. This larva\r\nis the borer and in early spring attacks tender shoots boring down\r\ninto the pith. It passes from one succulent shoot to another so that\r\noften many wilted shoots may be examined before the borer is found.\r\nFortunately peach-trees send out shoots about as rapidly as this pest\r\ncan destroy them so that in New York, at least, unless the tree is much\r\nweakened in vitality, not much harm is done. The twig-borer has small\r\nchance in a well-kept orchard, but, should it attain headway, prompt\r\ntreatment with arsenate of lead will at once cut short its career.\r\n\r\nOccasionally complaints come that the common rose-bug or rose-chafer\r\n(_Macrodactylus subspinosus_ Fabricius) is at work on the peach.\r\nLeaves, flowers and fruits are eaten. The fuzz on the epidermis of the\r\nfruit is a deterrent but once a beetle gets through into the flesh, a\r\ndozen more join in the banquet and the peach is quickly ruined. Now and\r\nthen one hears of a crop destroyed by the beetle. Insecticides seldom\r\navail, for the insects are very resistant to poisons. The insects breed\r\nonly in waste places and hence they may be looked for in the orchards\r\nof the sloven or where slovenly kept fields adjoin. Cultivation and\r\nsanitation are, then, the preventives. In New York rose-bugs are\r\nabundant only in warm, sandy soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLEADING VARIETIES OF PEACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL DEWEY\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga. Sta.

Cat._ 36. 1909. =6.= Waugh _Am.\r\n    Peach Orch._ 201. 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the peach most of all desired nowadays by peach-growers is\r\na very early, yellow-fleshed freestone. For years Admiral Dewey and\r\nTriumph, both seedlings of Alexander, have been grown to fill this\r\nplace and both, in the main, fail. Admiral Dewey, while early, yellow\r\nin flesh and good in quality, is not always a freestone and has several\r\nother defects which make it nearly worthless as a commercial fruit.\r\nThus, though the trees are very productive, the peaches run small, are\r\nso heavily pubescent as to be unattractive, are very susceptible to\r\nbrown-rot and are often disfigured with the peach-scab. The trees, too,\r\nsuffer much from leaf-curl. With Alexander as the parent, the trees\r\nshould be hardy, and from behavior elsewhere, must be so rated; but\r\nthey have not proved exceptionally so on our grounds. While nowhere\r\nlargely planted, Admiral Dewey is often set, as no doubt it should be,\r\nfor an early peach in the home orchard. Of the two early sorts, this\r\nvariety stands shipment rather better than Triumph. The varieties are\r\nof about the same season, both coming a week or thereabouts later than\r\nthe well-known Alexander.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey was grown from a seed of Alexander by J. D. Husted,\r\nVineyard, Georgia, in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century. It was\r\nintroduced in 1899 by Mr. Husted and has since been grown commercially\r\neast and west, north and south. The American Pomological Society placed\r\nthe variety on its fruit-list in 1909 as Dewey but the full name\r\nbestowed to commemorate the great Admiral should, we think, be retained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL DEWEY]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, very\r\n    productive; trunk thick, smooth; branches stocky, reddish-brown\r\n    mingled with light ash-gray; branchlets slender, long,\r\n    olive-green overspread with dark red, glossy, smooth, glabrous,\r\n    with numerous lenticels, raised near the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and one-half inches wide, folded\r\n    upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate, thin; upper surface\r\n    olive-green, smooth except near the midrib; lower surface light\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole one-fourth inch long, with one to seven large,\r\n    reniform, greenish-yellow glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small, short, conical, pubescent, plump, free;\r\n    blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers pink, one and one-half\r\n    inches across, well distributed, usually in twos; pedicels\r\n    short, thick, glabrous, green; calyx-tube dull reddish-green,\r\n    orange-colored within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    short, broad, obtuse, glabrous within, slightly pubescent\r\n    without; petals round-ovate, tapering to short, broad claws red\r\n    at the base; filaments one-half inch long, shorter than the\r\n    petals; pistil pubescent at the ovary, equal to the stamens in\r\n    length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; two and one-fourth inches long, two and\r\n    one-half inches wide, round-oblate, slightly compressed; cavity\r\n    deep, wide, abrupt, with tender skin; suture shallow, becoming\r\n    deeper at the extremities; apex roundish or flattened, with\r\n    mucronate tip variable in size; color deep orange-yellow,\r\n    blushed with dark red, indistinctly splashed and mottled;\r\n    pubescence heavy; skin thin, tender, adherent to the pulp;\r\n    flesh yellow, tinged with red near the pit, juicy, stringy,\r\n    tender, melting, sweet but sprightly; good in quality;\r\n    stone semi-free to free, one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    seven-eighths inch wide, oval to obovate, flattened at the\r\n    base, tapering to a short point, with grooved surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture deeply grooved along the sides, wide; dorsal suture a\r\n    deep, wide groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cult. & Count.

Unfortunately, there are\r\nfew fruit-characters to commend Alexander; the peaches run small,\r\nthe flesh clings to the stone and is so tender that the two can be\r\nseparated only with difficulty, and the quality is poor. Added to\r\nthe defects of the fruit the trees have the grave fault of being\r\nunproductive. The fruits, too, are very susceptible to brown-rot but to\r\noffset this weakness, the trees are more resistant to leaf-curl than\r\nthose of the average variety. Alexander has been more or less grown in\r\nevery peach-region on this continent, sometimes attaining considerable\r\ncommercial importance, but is now widely cultivated only on the Pacific\r\nSlope, and even here it is evidently destined to pass out before many\r\nyears in the competition with newer and better sorts. It is often\r\nconfused with Amsden though the two are quite distinct.\r\n\r\nAlexander originated soon after the Civil War on the farm of O. A.\r\nAlexander, Mount Pulaski, Illinois. Since 1877 it has been on the\r\nfruit-list of the American Pomological Society. It has been the parent\r\nof a score or more of meritorious extra-early peaches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, unproductive;\r\n    trunk stocky, smooth; branches reddish-brown overlaid with\r\n    light ash-gray; branchlets medium to long, olive-green overlaid\r\n    on the sunny side with dark red, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and one-half inches wide, folded\r\n    upward, oval-lanceolate, thin, leathery; upper surface dark\r\n    green, smooth; lower surface light grayish-green; margin finely\r\n    serrate, tipped with dark red glands; petiole three-eighths\r\n    inch long, glandless or with one to four small, usually\r\n    globose, greenish-yellow glands tipped with red, variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds oblong-conic, pubescent, usually free; blooming\r\n    season early; flowers pale pink, one and seven-sixteenths\r\n    inches across, in well-distributed clusters; pedicels very\r\n    short, thick, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube dull green, light\r\n    yellowish within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short,\r\n    broad, acute, glabrous within, slightly pubescent without;\r\n    petals roundish, often broadly notched near the base, tapering\r\n    to short, broad claws marked with red; filaments nearly\r\n    one-half inch long; pistil pubescent at the ovary, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very early; two and one-eighth inches long, two\r\n    and one-fourth inches wide, round, slightly compressed, with\r\n    sides nearly equal; cavity deep, abrupt or slightly flaring;\r\n    suture shallow; apex depressed, ending in a mucronate or\r\n    small, mamelon, recurved tip; color greenish-white becoming\r\n    creamy-white, blushed and blotched with dark red, mottled;\r\n    pubescence short; skin separates readily from the pulp; flesh\r\n    greenish-white, juicy, stringy, sweet, very mild; fair to good\r\n    in quality; stone clinging, one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    five-eighths inch thick, oval, plump, faintly winged, abruptly\r\n    pointed at the apex, with slightly pitted surfaces and with a\r\n    few grooves; ventral suture deeply grooved along the sides,\r\n    bulged; dorsal suture deeply furrowed, faintly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTON\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ill.

It merits the esteem bestowed upon it\r\nby virtue of large size, handsome appearance and high quality of the\r\npeaches and hardiness and productiveness in the trees. It ripens a\r\nlittle earlier than Champion, long the favorite white-fleshed peach of\r\nits season, does not rot so readily when brown-rot is rife and hangs\r\nlonger on the tree in good condition. It is not, however, quite so\r\nchoicely good in quality as Champion, nor, on the Station grounds at\r\nleast, are the trees quite as productive. Other faults of Alton are\r\nthat leaf-curl takes heavy toll on unsprayed trees, the blossoms open\r\nso early as often to be caught by spring frosts, and the peaches show\r\ngreat variation in size and shape and even in texture and flavor.\r\nThe accompanying cut shows the beauty of the outside but unfortunately\r\non the grounds of this Station the variety is almost a clingstone so\r\nthat the stone could not be separated to permit photographing the\r\ncreamy-white flesh, red at pit, and, all in all, most tempting to the\r\neye. Alton seems to be most at home in the Middle West and South and is\r\nnot a familiar inhabitant of eastern orchards as a commercial product.\r\n\r\nThis variety originated with T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas, a\r\nquarter-century ago and was introduced by him under the name Minnie. By\r\nsome it is supposed to have come from Alton, Illinois, and to have been\r\nintroduced as Emma but this is an error. Munson's Minnie was tested at\r\nthe Illinois Experiment Station from which place Stark Brothers Nursery\r\nCompany, Louisiana, Missouri, received it and propagated it under the\r\nname Alton. In 1909 the American Pomological Society placed the variety\r\nupon its list of fruits as Alton, a name which usage makes preferable\r\nto the first one, Minnie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALTON]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, hardy, medium in\r\n    productiveness; trunk very stocky; branches thick,\r\n    reddish-bronze overlaid with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    slender, long, olive-green mingled with dull red, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with many small, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval-lanceolate, broad; upper\r\n    surface dark green, rugose at the base; lower surface light\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with dark glands;\r\n    petiole three-eighths inch long, with two to four reniform\r\n    glands, greenish-yellow, tipped with dull red, variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small, short, conical, usually appressed, heavily\r\n    pubescent; season of bloom early; flowers pale pink, nearly\r\n    two inches across; borne usually singly; pedicels very short,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube dull reddish-green, tinged with\r\n    greenish-yellow within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    acute to slightly obtuse, glabrous within, heavily pubescent\r\n    without; petals roundish-oval, with blunt apex, frequently\r\n    notched near the base, tapering to narrow claws; filaments\r\n    one-half inch long; pistil pubescent at the ovary, as long as\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and five-sixteenths\r\n    inches long, two and five-eighths inches thick, round-oblate,\r\n    slightly compressed, with unequal halves; cavity abrupt or\r\n    slightly flaring; suture of medium depth; apex roundish,\r\n    mucronate; color creamy-white overspread with dull red, dotted\r\n    and splashed with carmine; pubescence thin, short; skin tough,\r\n    adhering slightly to the pulp; flesh white, juicy, stringy,\r\n    tender, pleasantly subacid; fair in quality; stone semi-cling,\r\n    one and three-eighths inches long, seven-eighths inch wide,\r\n    obovate, plump at the apex, winged near the base, with pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture deeply grooved along the sides,\r\n    narrow; dorsal suture deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nARP\r\n\r\n    =1.= _N.

This is the chief reason for\r\nits cultivation though it has other good characters beside earliness\r\nto give it a place among yellow peaches. At this Station the trees are\r\nhealthy, vigorous, productive and hardier in bud than the average, the\r\nbuds having withstood the cold of two test winters. The round-oval\r\nshape and shallow suture give it a pleasing appearance of rotundity.\r\nTo its shapeliness, add a skin creamy-yellow, heavily blushed with red\r\nand covered with short, thick pubescence with the sheen of velvet, and\r\nyou have a beautiful peach--well shown in the color-plate. The flesh\r\nis light yellow, firm, juicy, sweet, rich, and of excellent quality,\r\nbut unfortunately clings rather tenaciously to the stone. The season of\r\nArp is from a month to five weeks earlier than Elberta and for so early\r\na peach is remarkably long. It is somewhat susceptible to brown-rot.\r\nWe do not know from experience how the fruit will ship but believe it\r\nwill stand the wear and tear of transportation and markets as well as\r\nany of the standard peaches. Arp ought to be in every home orchard.\r\nAttention is called to the fact that the June Elberta in the hands of\r\nsome growers is Arp.\r\n\r\nArp originated with C. P. Orr, Arp, Texas, about 1897. Elberta is\r\nsupposed to have been one of the parents while the other may have\r\nbeen a peach of the Indian type. The variety was introduced by the\r\noriginator about 1902.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARP]\r\n\r\n    Tree rather large, vigorous, spreading, hardy, productive;\r\n    trunk stocky, intermediate in smoothness; branches thick,\r\n    smooth, reddish-bronze overlaid with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    with internodes intermediate in length, pinkish-red mingled\r\n    with green, smooth, glabrous, with many smallish lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, oval-lanceolate, sometimes inclined to\r\n    obovate, thin, somewhat leathery; upper surface dark green;\r\n    lower surface grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with\r\n    reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with\r\n    one to three large, reniform, greenish-yellow or reddish-brown\r\n    glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds intermediate in size and length, plump,\r\n    oblong-conic, pubescent, appressed; blossoms opening in\r\n    mid-season; flowers light pink, one and three-fourths inches\r\n    across; borne seldom in twos; pedicels short, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube dark reddish-green, dull orange within, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes long, medium in width, obtuse to\r\n    acute, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals\r\n    round-obovate, usually broadly notched on each side of the\r\n    base, tapering to short, narrow claws; filaments one-half inch\r\n    long; pistil glabrous, pubescent at the ovary, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; two and one-sixteenth inches long, two\r\n    and one-eighth inches wide, oval to round, compressed, the\r\n    halves unequal; cavity medium to deep, wide, abrupt; suture\r\n    shallow, deeper at the base; apex roundish or depressed,\r\n    with a mucronate tip; color greenish-yellow changing to deep\r\n    yellow, heavily blushed with red, indistinctly striped, with\r\n    conspicuous, large dots; pubescence short, stiff, thick;\r\n    skin thick, tough, adhering to the pulp; flesh light yellow\r\n    mingled with faint stripes of red radiating from the pit,\r\n    juicy, stringy, tender, sweet, highly flavored; very good in\r\n    quality; stone clinging, one and three-sixteenths inches long,\r\n    three-fourths inch wide, narrow-oval, plump, with short, acute\r\n    apex, the surfaces pitted and with few short grooves; ventral\r\n    suture slightly winged, rather widely furrowed; dorsal suture a\r\n    deep, narrow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

At its best it is one of the glories of the\r\npeach-orchard, the fruits being large, trim in contour, creamy-white,\r\nwith a beautiful crimson cheek--truly voluptuous in form and color.\r\nThe color-plate--made in a poor season--falls far short of doing the\r\nfruits justice in size and art cannot depict the soft tints of red and\r\ncream which make Belle so beautiful. The fruits are as enticing to the\r\neye inwardly as outwardly, the white flesh being delicately marbled,\r\ntinted with red at the pit and the flesh and pit usually part cleanly.\r\nUnfortunately, appearance misrepresents quality; for the variety, while\r\ngood, falls short in flavor, and the flesh is stringy so that it must\r\nbe rated as not above the average for its type. The trees are large,\r\nopen-headed, a little straggling, fast-growing and hardy, though, like\r\nmost of its type, easy prey to leaf-curl. Belle prefers a southern\r\nclimate and in the South is often a good commercial sort but in New\r\nYork is grown only for local markets and home use, hardly equalling\r\nChampion as a white-fleshed peach for distant markets.\r\n\r\nBelle came from a seed of Chinese Cling planted in 1870 by L. A.\r\nRumph, Marshallville, Georgia. The other parent is unknown but it is\r\nsupposed to have been Oldmixon Free, a tree of which stood near the\r\nChinese Cling tree. The variety came to notice about the same time as\r\nElberta and has been thought by some to be a seedling of Elberta. The\r\nAmerican Pomological Society listed Belle in its catalog in 1899 as\r\nGeorgia but in 1909 changed the name to Belle and it is so designated\r\nin horticultural treatises but popularly it is \"Belle of Georgia.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELLE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, hardy, very\r\n    productive; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    covered with light ash-gray; branchlets thick, medium to long,\r\n    olive-green overlaid with dark red, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous conspicuous, rather small lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and one-half inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, oblong-lanceolate, somewhat leathery;\r\n    upper surface dark green, smooth; lower surface light\r\n    grayish-green; margin coarsely serrate, tipped with dark red\r\n    glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with two to six\r\n    large, reniform or globose, greenish-yellow glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, long, oval, very plump, strongly pubescent,\r\n    usually appressed; blooming season early; flowers pale pink\r\n    but deeper in color along the edges, one and three-eighths\r\n    inches across, often in twos; pedicels long, thick;\r\n    calyx-tube dull reddish-green, yellowish within, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes medium in length and width, acute to\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals\r\n    roundish-oval, tapering to short, broad claws red at the base;\r\n    filaments nearly one-half inch long; pistil pubescent at the\r\n    ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-sixteenth inches long,\r\n    two and one-eighth inches wide, roundish-oval, often bulged\r\n    near the apex, somewhat compressed, with halves nearly equal;\r\n    cavity abrupt or somewhat flaring, red, with tender skin;\r\n    suture shallow, deepening toward the apex; apex roundish to\r\n    slightly pointed, with a mucronate tip; color greenish-white\r\n    changing to creamy-white, blushed with red, with faint stripes\r\n    and splashes of darker red, mottled; pubescence short, fine,\r\n    rather thick; skin thin, tender, adherent to the pulp; flesh\r\n    white, tinged with red at the pit and with radiating rays of\r\n    red, juicy, stringy, tender, sweet, mild; good in quality;\r\n    stone semi-free to free, one and one-eighth inches long,\r\n    thirteen-sixteenths inch wide, oval, bulged near the apex,\r\n    blunt at the base, with short, sharp point at the apex, with\r\n    deeply-pitted surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed along\r\n    the sides, wide; dorsal suture a narrow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEQUETTE FREE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

It is not\r\na new variety, however, and the fact that it seems to have been rather\r\nwidely and well tested without receiving general commendation except\r\non the Pacific Slope is against its having a place in the list of\r\ndesirable peaches for the Eastern States. The trees are fast-growing,\r\nvery vigorous, hardy and densely clothed with foliage but cannot be\r\ncalled fruitful and are, possibly, a little too susceptible\r\nto leaf-curl. The color-plate shows the fruit to be a little more\r\nirregular than it is in nature.\r\n\r\nThis variety originated about 1860 in a seedling orchard of Benjamin\r\nBequette, Visalia, California. J. H. Thomas of the same place named\r\nthe sort and first propagated it about 1877. In 1899 the American\r\nPomological Society added the variety to its list of fruits under the\r\nname Bequett Free but in 1909 corrected the spelling to Bequette Free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEQUETTE FREE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, hardy, rather\r\n    unproductive; trunk thick, smooth; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown mingled with light ash-gray; branchlets slender,\r\n    long, olive-green mingled with dark red, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous large and small, inconspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves very numerous, six and three-fourths inches long, one\r\n    and three-fourths inches wide, folded upward, oval-lanceolate\r\n    inclined to broad-obovate, leathery; upper surface very\r\n    dark green, smooth or slightly rugose; lower surface light\r\n    grayish-green; margin coarsely serrate, tipped with dark\r\n    glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with two to five\r\n    large, reniform, greenish-yellow glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, long, oblong-conic, plump, pointed, heavily\r\n    pubescent, usually appressed; blossoms appear in mid-season;\r\n    flowers light to dark pink, nearly one and one-fourth inches\r\n    across, borne in ones and twos; pedicels short, thick,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green, light yellow within,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes rather short, medium to\r\n    narrow, nearly acute, pubescent within, heavily pubescent\r\n    without; petals roundish-oval, slightly notched near the base,\r\n    tapering to short, narrow claws tinged with red at the base;\r\n    filaments nearly one-half inch long, shorter than the petals;\r\n    pistil heavily pubescent at the ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-half inches long,\r\n    two and three-eighths inches wide, round-oval, compressed,\r\n    often with unequal sides; cavity small, deep, abrupt or\r\n    flaring, often tinged with red; suture shallow, deepening\r\n    toward the apex; apex roundish, depressed at the center, with\r\n    a small, recurved, mamelon tip; color greenish-white mingled\r\n    with yellow, blushed, splashed and blotched with dark red;\r\n    pubescence thick, long, coarse; skin thin, tough, separates\r\n    readily from the pulp; flesh white, slightly tinged with red\r\n    near the pit, juicy, stringy, tender and melting, pleasantly\r\n    flavored, sprightly; good to very good in quality; stone nearly\r\n    free, one and three-eighths inches long, seven-eighths inch\r\n    wide, oval, with a short-pointed apex, medium in plumpness,\r\n    with deeply pitted and slightly grooved surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture slightly bulged near the apex, deeply furrowed along the\r\n    edges, narrow; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERENICE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _La.

The trees are about\r\nall that could be desired, falling short chiefly in not being as\r\nproductive as several other peaches of its season and in being a little\r\nsusceptible to leaf-curl. The variety has been offered to fruit-growers\r\na sufficient length of time to have had its merits well tried as a\r\ncommercial peach and the fact that it is not now largely grown is\r\npresumptive evidence that it has little commercial value. Its high\r\nquality makes the variety a good sort for the home collection at least.\r\n\r\nBerenice originated some thirty or more years ago with the late Dr. L.\r\nE. Berckmans of Augusta, Georgia. It is supposed to have sprung from\r\nthe pit of a General Lee tree which grew in one of Mr. Berckmans' test\r\norchards. In the Berckmans nursery catalog it is stated of Berenice\r\nthat after thirty years' trial \"there is nothing equal to it in the\r\nsame season.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BERENICE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, hardy, medium to\r\n    productive; trunk stocky; branches thick, smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    mingled with light ash-gray; branchlets with short internodes,\r\n    dark red overlaid with olive-green, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous large and small lenticels raised at the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and five-eighths inches wide,\r\n    folded upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate, leathery; upper\r\n    surface dark green, smooth; lower surface light grayish-green;\r\n    margin coarsely serrate, tipped with dark glands; petiole\r\n    one-fourth inch long, with two to ten large, reniform,\r\n    yellowish-green glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, oblong, slightly pointed, heavily pubescent,\r\n    usually appressed; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers\r\n    one and three-sixteenths inches across, pale pink, tinged\r\n    darker along the edges, well distributed; pedicels short,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube red mingled with dull, dark green,\r\n    orange-colored within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes often\r\n    broad, acute to obtuse, glabrous within, slightly pubescent or\r\n    heavily pubescent without; petals round-ovate, broadly notched,\r\n    tapering to short claws red at base; filaments three-eighths\r\n    inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent at the\r\n    ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and five-eighths inches\r\n    long, two and one-half inches wide, round-oval, with halves\r\n    often unequal; cavity deep, medium to wide, contracted around\r\n    the sides, with tender skin, often blushed with red; suture\r\n    shallow, deepening toward the apex; apex roundish or depressed,\r\n    with a mucronate or mamelon tip; color greenish-yellow, blushed\r\n    and splashed with red; pubescence short, medium fine; skin\r\n    tough, separates from the pulp; flesh yellow, faintly tinted\r\n    with red near the pit, stringy, tender and melting, sweet,\r\n    mild, pleasant flavored; good in quality; stone nearly free,\r\n    one and three-eighths inches long, fifteen-sixteenths inch\r\n    wide, oval, plump, drawn out at the ends, usually with pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed along the edges;\r\n    dorsal suture deeply grooved, with sides slightly wing-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD CLING\r\n\r\n    =1.= Bridgeman _Gard.

Unfortunately, the beet-red color of the flesh could not be\r\nreproduced with sufficient accuracy to make the attempt satisfactory.\r\nIt is a pleasant peach to eat out of hand and is much used for pickling\r\nand preserving, for which purposes it has real merit. The round-headed,\r\ncompact tree might make the variety a desirable parent in breeding new\r\npeaches.\r\n\r\nThis peach is an American seedling raised many years ago from the\r\nBlood Clingstone of the French. The fruit is much larger than that of\r\nthe parent sort but otherwise is much the same. The Blood Free raised\r\nby John M. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts, while somewhat of the nature\r\nof Blood Cling, is, nevertheless, a different sort. The American\r\nPomological Society listed Blood Cling in its catalog in 1871 under the\r\nname Indian Blood Cling. In 1897 this name was changed to Blood Cling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOOD CLING]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round, compact, hardy, unproductive;\r\n    trunk thick; branches stocky, reddish-bronze, with a light\r\n    ash-gray tinge; branchlets slender, long, with short\r\n    internodes, olive-green overlaid with dark red, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous usually small, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and three-fourths inches long, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval-lanceolate; leaves thin,\r\n    somewhat leathery; upper surface dark green, varying from\r\n    smooth to rugose; lower surface light grayish-green; margin\r\n    finely serrate, with dark brown glands; petiole three-eighths\r\n    inch long, with two to five reniform, light or dark green\r\n    glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, long, plump, oblong-conic, pubescent,\r\n    free; flowers open in mid-season; blossoms pink, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches across; pedicels short, glabrous,\r\n    pale green; calyx-tube dull, speckled, greenish-red, light\r\n    greenish-yellow within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    long, narrow, acute, glabrous within, heavily pubescent\r\n    without; petals oval to ovate, crenate near the base,\r\n    tapering to short, narrow claws white at the base; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil\r\n    pubescent, seven-sixteenths inch long, equal to or shorter than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; one and three-fourths inches long, one\r\n    and seven-eighths inches thick, compressed, with unequal halves\r\n    often giving a lopsided appearance; cavity narrow, abrupt,\r\n    usually white; suture shallow; apex round, with a mucronate\r\n    tip; color dull greenish-white, entirely overspread with dingy\r\n    pink mingled with splashes and stripes of darker, clouded red,\r\n    mottled; pubescence long, coarse; skin tough, adherent to the\r\n    pulp; flesh red, becoming lighter colored next the stone,\r\n    juicy, coarse, stringy, tough and meaty, brisk, pleasantly\r\n    flavored; fair in quality; stone clinging, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches long, seven-eighths inch wide, oval to slightly obovate,\r\n    short-pointed, strongly bulged near the apex, with grooved and\r\n    pitted surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed at the sides,\r\n    narrow; dorsal suture deep, medium in width.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD LEAF\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

Its beet-red leaves in early\r\nspring and its pink blossoms, borne in great profusion, entitle it to\r\nesteem for both foliage and flowers. It is worth growing as well for\r\nits fruits. The color-plate opposite page 78 shows the flowers and the\r\naccompanying illustration depicts the fruit-characters. The peaches\r\nare in no way remarkable and yet they please some as a dessert fruit.\r\nSeedlings springing up under two trees of this variety in the Station\r\norchard in 1913, furnished interesting data on the inheritance of the\r\nblood-red color in the leaves of this peach. Out of 252 young trees,\r\n189 were red-leaved and 63 green-leaved--an exact three-to-one ratio to\r\nshow that the green color is carried as a recessive.\r\n\r\nSeveral stories are told of the origin of this peach. One is that\r\non the battlefield of Fort Donelson, Kentucky, a southern general,\r\nfatally wounded, sucked the juice of a peach and threw the stone into\r\nthe little pool of blood which flowed from his side. From this pit in\r\nits bloody seed-bed sprang the tree with its blood-red leaves. John\r\nL. Hebron, in a letter published in _Gardener's Monthly_, 1873, tells\r\na different tale. According to Hebron the variety was found by P. I.\r\nConnor in 1866 at Champion Hills, Mississippi, on the battlefield where\r\nGeneral Tilghman was killed, a tree having sprung up close to the spot\r\nwhere the General died. The variety is sometimes called the General\r\nTilghman peach. Leaving fable and coming to facts, we find that the\r\nvariety originated in Mississippi in the sixties and was introduced to\r\nthe trade in 1871.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOOD LEAF]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, willowy in growth,\r\n    open-topped, hardy, unproductive; trunk thick, rough; branches\r\n    smooth, reddish-bronze overspread with light ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets slender, long, with short internodes, dull green\r\n    overlaid with dark red, smooth, glabrous, with numerous small,\r\n    inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves four and three-fourths inches long, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval-lanceolate with tendency\r\n    to obovate, thin; upper surface when young purplish-red\r\n    but changing to green, smooth or rugose; lower surface\r\n    purplish-olive; margin finely serrate, tipped with small, dark\r\n    glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with two to five\r\n    small, reniform, greenish-yellow, red-tipped glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, oblong-conic, plump, pubescent, appressed;\r\n    blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers one and one-half\r\n    inches across, pale pink, occasionally in twos; pedicels\r\n    nearly sessile, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube dark, dull red\r\n    mingled with green, yellowish within, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes long, narrow, acute, glabrous within, slightly\r\n    pubescent to heavily pubescent without; petals oval, slightly\r\n    contracted toward the apex, tapering to short claws; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil equal\r\n    to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; one and five-eighths inches long,\r\n    nearly one and five-eighths inches wide, roundish-oval,\r\n    slightly compressed, with unequal sides, with prominent bulge\r\n    near the apex; cavity deep, narrow, abrupt, contracted about\r\n    the sides, marked with narrow, radiating stripes of pale red;\r\n    suture very shallow, becoming deeper toward the apex; apex\r\n    roundish or slightly depressed, with a small, mucronate or\r\n    recurved, mamelon tip; color greenish-white and pale yellow,\r\n    lightly washed with dull pink which changes to dull brown, in\r\n    some cases deepening to a reddish blush; pubescence thick,\r\n    short, fine; skin thin, tender, adherent to the pulp; flesh\r\n    white to the pit, juicy, coarse, meaty but tender, sweetish,\r\n    with some astringency; poor in quality; stone clinging, over\r\n    one inch long, three-fourths inch wide, oval, very plump,\r\n    tapering to a short, blunt point at the apex, with grooved\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture lightly furrowed along the sides,\r\n    rather wide; dorsal suture with narrow groove, slightly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIGDON\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Still, it belongs with the Crawfords, aristocrats\r\namong peaches, and this is enough to give it standing in a home\r\ncollection at least. In tree and fruit it is similar to and a worthy\r\nrival of Early Crawford and has the same two fatal faults to bar it\r\nfrom commercial plantations--the trees are capricious as to soils and\r\nare often unproductive. On the other hand, a character of the tree to\r\ncommend it to the amateur is that it is one of the least susceptible of\r\nall peach-trees to leaf-curl. The variety is well known only in western\r\nNew York and is going out in this region.\r\n\r\nBrigdon originated more than a quarter-century ago in Cayuga County,\r\nNew York, and has been grown since more or less extensively on the\r\nshores of Seneca Lake. The name Garfield was given to this peach by\r\nsome one but why or when does not appear. The variety was added to the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society's recommended list of fruits in 1899, a\r\ndistinction it has since held.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIGDON]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, hardy,\r\n    unproductive; trunk thick; branches stocky, rather smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown overlaid with light ash-gray; branchlets slender,\r\n    with tendency to branch, long, olive-green overlaid with\r\n    dark red, smooth, glabrous, with numerous large and small,\r\n    inconspicuous, irregularly shaped and often raised lenticels,\r\n    the expansion of which causes a cracking of the bark.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and seven-eighths inches long, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thin; upper surface dark green, rugose; lower surface light\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with dark glands;\r\n    petiole nearly one-half inch long, glandless or with one\r\n    to four small, globose, greenish-yellow glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds oblong-conic, pubescent, somewhat shrunken, usually\r\n    free; blossoms open in mid-season.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-half inches long,\r\n    two and three-fourths inches wide, round-oval to cordate,\r\n    compressed, bulged beak-like near the apex; cavity deep,\r\n    medium to wide, abrupt or flaring, often colored with red;\r\n    suture shallow, becoming deep near the apex; apex roundish,\r\n    with a pointed or recurved, mamelon tip; color greenish-yellow\r\n    changing to pale orange-yellow, speckled and splashed with\r\n    dull red which often extends over nearly the whole surface;\r\n    pubescence long, thick, woolly; skin thin, somewhat tough,\r\n    separates from the pulp only when fully ripe; flesh yellow,\r\n    juicy, coarse, firm, tender, sweet, mild, pleasant flavored;\r\n    very good in quality; stone semi-free to free, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches long, seven-eighths inch wide, oval,\r\n    decidedly bulged on one side, with a rather long and slightly\r\n    curved point, with pitted and grooved surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    deeply furrowed along the edges, medium in width; dorsal suture\r\n    grooved, slightly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

The variety has few characters to commend it excepting\r\nearliness and hardiness though the trees often load themselves with\r\nfruit. The peaches, though small, are attractive in color which\r\nis bright red on a light background. The red is well shown in the\r\ncolor-plate though the fruits illustrated are rather smaller than\r\nusual. Canada is about the poorest of all peaches in flavor. The fruits\r\nare firm and ship well for a white-fleshed peach making, so many\r\nmaintain, a better commercial variety than its rival, Alexander. On\r\nour grounds Canada is freer from rot than Alexander and the flesh does\r\nnot cling as tightly. All agree that the tree is very hardy. However,\r\nthere ought to be but small place in the peach-lists of nowadays for\r\na variety so poor in quality and with fruits of such inferior size as\r\nthose of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe variety originated as a chance seedling more than a quarter-century\r\nago with A. H. High, Jordan, Ontario, Canada. It is often known as\r\nEarly Canada and is not infrequently confounded with Amsden and\r\nAlexander, varieties of the same season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANADA]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, upright-spreading, open-topped, hardy, productive;\r\n    trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown overspread\r\n    with light ash-gray; branchlets with internodes medium in\r\n    length, dark red, with a slight tinge of green, glossy, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, slightly curving, with numerous conspicuous, large,\r\n    raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, six inches long, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches wide, oval to obovate-lanceolate, medium in thickness;\r\n    upper surface pale olive-green, smooth or rugose; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole one-fourth inch long, with one to four small,\r\n    globose, greenish-yellow glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small, short, narrow, pointed, not very plump, dark\r\n    colored, appressed; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers\r\n    dark pink at the center, bordered with lighter pink, one\r\n    and one-half inches across; pedicels very short, glabrous,\r\n    green; calyx-tube reddish-green, lemon-yellow within, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes short, obtuse, glabrous within, slightly\r\n    or heavily pubescent without; petals roundish-ovate, widely\r\n    notched at the base, tapering to long, broad claws red at the\r\n    base; filaments one-half inch long, shorter than the petals;\r\n    pistil equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very early; two inches long, two and one-fourth\r\n    inches wide, round-oblate, slightly compressed, with unequal\r\n    sides; cavity wide, flaring; suture shallow to deep; apex\r\n    ending in a mucronate, recurved tip; color creamy white,\r\n    blushed with red and mottled and splashed with darker red;\r\n    pubescence short, thick; skin thin, tender, separates from the\r\n    pulp; flesh white, juicy, fine-grained, meaty but tender, sweet\r\n    yet sprightly; fair in quality; stone semi-clinging, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches long, seven-eighths inch wide, round-oval to\r\n    elliptical, plump, abruptly pointed, with small grooves in the\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture very deeply grooved along the sides,\r\n    narrow; dorsal suture deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN EDE\r\n\r\n    =1.= Lovett _Cat._ 29. 1897. =2.= _W.

Those who recommend it\r\nsay that the trees are vigorous, heavy bearers and that the crop is\r\nuniform and always fair, smooth and without culls. The crop matures\r\nin a short time, ships well and is in demand in the markets either\r\nas a dessert peach or for culinary purposes. On the Station grounds,\r\nCaptain Ede comes up to the reputation given it in all respects\r\nexcepting productiveness--here it is a shy bearer. The peaches, as the\r\ncolor-plate shows, are beautiful, the flavor is subacid but rich, with\r\na distinct smack of the almond. Captain Ede ripens with Early Crawford,\r\na week or ten days before Elberta. The tree, as it grows here, can\r\nhardly be distinguished from that of Elberta. We should unhesitatingly\r\nrecommend Captain Ede to New York peach-growers, were it not for the\r\nfear that it does not accommodate itself to a diversity of soils and\r\nclimates. It does rather better farther south.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ede originated in 1870 as a seedling in the door-yard of\r\nCaptain Henry Ede, Cobden, Illinois. Later, it was introduced by George\r\nGould and Son, Villa Ridge, Illinois. The parentage of the variety is\r\nunknown. By some, Chinese Cling is supposed to have been one of the\r\nparents and others give the same credit to Honest John. The American\r\nPomological Society added Captain Ede to its fruit-list in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN EDE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, not always\r\n    productive; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    overspread with very light ash-gray; branchlets slender,\r\n    olive-green more or less overspread with dark red, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous large or very small, inconspicuous\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and three-fourths inches long, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate; upper\r\n    surface dark green, smooth; lower surface light grayish-green;\r\n    margin finely serrate, tipped with dark red glands;\r\n    petiole one-fourth inch long, with two to six, reniform,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands medium in size and variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, long, oblong-conic, plump, usually\r\n    appressed; blossoms open very late; flowers three-fourths\r\n    inch across, dark pink; pedicels short, glabrous, pale\r\n    green; calyx-tube dull, dotted reddish-green, orange-red\r\n    within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, broad,\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals\r\n    roundish-ovate, notched near the base, tapering to short,\r\n    narrow, white claws; filaments one-fourth inch long, equal to\r\n    the petals in length; pistil pubescent toward the base, equal\r\n    to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; about two and one-fourth inches\r\n    in diameter, roundish-cordate to somewhat oval, very slightly\r\n    compressed, with nearly equal halves, bulged near the apex;\r\n    cavity wide, abrupt or flaring, often tinged with red and with\r\n    tender skin; suture variable in depth, extending more than\r\n    half-way around; apex roundish, with a prolonged, recurved,\r\n    mamelon tip; color orange-yellow, with specks and splashes of\r\n    red, blushed with darker red; pubescence thick, short, variable\r\n    in coarseness; skin tough, adherent to the pulp; flesh\r\n    yellow, stained red at the pit, dry, stringy, tender, somewhat\r\n    meaty, strongly aromatic, pleasantly flavored; good in quality;\r\n    stone free, one and one-fourth inches long, seven-eighths\r\n    inch wide, oval, bulged along the ventral suture, with pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed along the edges,\r\n    narrow; dorsal suture grooved, somewhat flattened.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARMAN\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

Possibly its chief asset is a\r\nconstitution which enables it to withstand trying climates, both north\r\nand south, and to accommodate itself to a great variety of soils. Thus,\r\nwe find Carman a very general favorite in nearly every peach-region on\r\nthis continent. Besides its cosmopolitan constitution, there is much\r\nmerit in the fruits especially for a peach ripening so early. While\r\nof but medium size (the color-plate does not do justice in showing\r\nthe size of Carman) the peaches are most pleasing in appearance. The\r\ncolor is a brilliant red splashed with darker red on a creamy-white\r\nbackground. The shape is nearly round and the trimness and symmetry of\r\nthe contour make the variety, especially when packed in box or basket,\r\none scarcely surpassed in attractiveness of form. Carman is rated\r\nas very good in quality for a peach of its season though a smack of\r\nbitterness in its mild, sweet flavor condemns it for some. The habit\r\nof growth is excellent, peaches are borne abundantly, brown-rot takes\r\ncomparatively little toll and in tree or bud the variety is remarkably\r\nhardy. All in all, Carman is one of the most useful peaches of its\r\nclass and season for either home or commercial planting.\r\n\r\nCarman grew from a seed planted in 1889 by J. W. Stubenrauch, Mexia,\r\nTexas. The tree fruited in 1892 and its earliness and freedom from rot\r\nso pleased Mr. Stubenrauch that he at once began propagating the new\r\nvariety, naming it Pride of Texas. Later, in 1894, the name was changed\r\nto Carman in honor of the late E. S. Carman, long editor of the _Rural\r\nNew Yorker_. In 1909 the American Pomological Society added Carman to\r\nits list of fruits as one of its recommended varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARMAN]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading or somewhat upright,\r\n    open-topped, hardy, very productive; trunk thick; branches\r\n    stocky, smooth, bright red overspread with ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    long, olive-green overspread with dark red, glabrous, smooth,\r\n    glossy, with numerous small, inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and seven-eighths inches long, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, folded upward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate; upper surface dark green, smooth; lower\r\n    surface light grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with\r\n    dark red glands; petiole one-fourth inch long, with three to\r\n    five reniform glands medium in size and variable in position\r\n    and color.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds oval, pointed, plump, heavily pubescent, appressed;\r\n    blossoms open in mid-season; flowers one and one-fourth inches\r\n    across, pink; pedicels short, glabrous, pale green; calyx-tube\r\n    dull reddish-green, speckled, yellowish-green within,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, acute to obtuse,\r\n    glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals oval to\r\n    ovate, with distinct notches near the base, tapering to narrow,\r\n    white claws of medium length; filaments three-eighths inch\r\n    long, shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent near the base,\r\n    shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; about two and one-fourth inches in\r\n    diameter, round-oval, compressed, with unequal sides, bulged\r\n    near the apex; cavity abrupt or flaring, tinged with pink\r\n    and with tender skin; suture shallow, becoming deeper at the\r\n    cavity; apex roundish or depressed, with a somewhat pointed or\r\n    mucronate tip; color creamy-white more or less overspread with\r\n    light red, with splashes of darker red; pubescence very thick,\r\n    short; skin thin, tough, adherent to the pulp; flesh white,\r\n    red at the pit, juicy, tender, sweet, mild, pleasant flavored;\r\n    very good in quality; stone nearly free, about one and one-half\r\n    inches long, one inch wide, oval, plump, with thickly-pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture deeply grooved along the edges, thick,\r\n    furrowed and winged; dorsal suture deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAIRS\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

In quality Chairs is\r\nunapproachable by varieties outside of its own family and is not\r\nsurpassed by any within its group. The variety was at one time a\r\nstandard late, yellow-fleshed, freestone, market peach competing in\r\npopularity with Late Crawford over which it often held ascendency\r\nbecause less subject to brown-rot. The coming of the showier and more\r\nproductive but less well-flavored varieties of the Elberta type has\r\ndriven the Crawford group from the markets and Chairs is now known\r\nonly in collections where it will long be treasured for its delectable\r\nquality. Unproductiveness and capriciousness in soil and climate,\r\nfaults of all Crawford-like peaches, are marked in Chairs. The fruits\r\nare usually larger than the specimens shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nChairs originated about 1880 in the orchard of Franklin Chairs,\r\nAnne Arundel County, Maryland. First called Chairs' Choice, the\r\napostrophe was dropped in 1891 by the American Pomological Society and\r\nstill later the same organization shortened the name to Chairs. Its\r\nhorticultural value was early appreciated by all pomologists and it has\r\nlong been a prime favorite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAIRS]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, unproductive;\r\n    trunk stocky; branches thick, smooth, reddish-brown covered\r\n    with light ash-gray; branchlets inclined to rebranch, short,\r\n    with long internodes, olive-green overlaid with dark red,\r\n    smooth, glabrous, with numerous large and small, raised\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and three-fourths inches long, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thin; upper surface dark green, smooth or somewhat rugose;\r\n    lower surface light grayish-green; margin coarsely serrate,\r\n    often in two series, tipped with reddish-brown glands;\r\n    petiole one-fourth inch long, with two to six small, globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, oblong-obtuse, very plump, usually free;\r\n    season of bloom late; flowers dark pink fading toward the\r\n    whitish centers, three-fourths inch across; pedicels short,\r\n    glabrous, pale green; calyx-tube dull, dotted reddish-green,\r\n    orange-red within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse,\r\n    glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals oval or\r\n    ovate, nearly entire, often notched near the base, tapering to\r\n    claws of medium width, white at the base; filaments one-fourth\r\n    inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil pubescent near\r\n    the ovary, usually longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in late mid-season; two and three-fourths inches\r\n    long, two and seven-eighths inches thick, roundish-oval,\r\n    irregular, bulged beak-like along one side toward the apex,\r\n    compressed, with unequal halves; cavity deep, wide, abrupt\r\n    or flaring; suture shallow, deepening toward the apex and\r\n    extending slightly beyond; apex roundish, with a mucronate or\r\n    small, recurved, mamelon tip; color golden-yellow, blushed\r\n    and splashed with dull red; pubescence short, fine; skin\r\n    thin, tough, free; flesh yellow, faintly stained with red\r\n    near the pit, juicy, stringy, tender, subacid or sprightly,\r\n    pleasantly flavored; very good in quality; stone free, one\r\n    and three-fourths inches long, one and three-eighths inches\r\n    wide, large, broadly oval, bulged along one side, plump, with\r\n    surfaces deeply pitted and with short grooves; ventral suture\r\n    wide, deeply furrowed along the sides, winged; dorsal suture a\r\n    deep, wide groove inclined to wing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPION\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

Peach Orch._ 200. 1913.\r\n\r\nChampion is the white-fleshed peach _par excellence_ in\r\nquality--rightly used as the standard to gauge the quality of all\r\nother white-fleshed peaches. The fruits are nearly as attractive to\r\nthe eye as to the palate but unfortunately run small and off color\r\nin all but choicely good peach-soils. The peaches are not only very\r\ngood in the characters that make up quality--tender flesh, juiciness,\r\npleasant flavor--but there is a peculiar honeyed sweetness possessed by\r\nfew other peaches which gives the Champion individuality. The color,\r\nbarring a slight excess in yellow, is well shown in the color-plate but\r\nthe size as shown is small. The tree of Champion is almost perfect from\r\nthe ground up, few other varieties surpassing it in height and girt and\r\nnone, on the Station grounds at least, equalling it in the quantity and\r\nthe luxuriant green of its foliage. A Champion tree is known by its\r\nfoliage as far as the eye can distinguish color. As would be expected\r\nfrom the tree-characters given, in soils to which it is suited,\r\nChampion rejoices in vigor and health as do few other varieties. The\r\nvariety surpasses most of its orchard-associates in productiveness but\r\nthe peaches are inviting prey to brown-rot and the trees are sometimes\r\ndefoliated with leaf-curl so that, with its capriciousness as to\r\nsoils, it has grave faults as a commercial variety. Because of high\r\nquality of the fruit and the beauty of the tree, Champion should have a\r\nconspicuous place in the orchard of the amateur.\r\n\r\nChampion is a seedling of Oldmixon Free supposedly fertilized by Early\r\nYork. The original seed was planted about 1880 by I. G. Hubbard,\r\nNokomis, Illinois, and the variety was introduced by him and by the\r\nDayton Star Nurseries in 1890. In the early years of its dissemination\r\nChampion was confused with an early, semi-cling variety which\r\noriginated in western Michigan and which was locally sold for a time\r\nunder the same name. The American Pomological Society added Champion to\r\nits fruit-list in 1897.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHAMPION]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, very productive;\r\n    trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown covered\r\n    with ash-gray; branchlets thick, very long, with short\r\n    internodes, olive-green overspread with dull red, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous large lenticels, inconspicuous except\r\n    toward the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and one-fourth inches long, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate; upper\r\n    surface dark green, rugose along the midrib; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with dark red\r\n    glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with two to five\r\n    small, globose, greenish-yellow glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, medium in length, plump, conical, pubescent,\r\n    free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers pink, less\r\n    than one inch across, well distributed; pedicels short,\r\n    glabrous, pale green; calyx-tube dark, mottled reddish-green,\r\n    greenish-yellow within, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes short,\r\n    broad, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent without, slightly\r\n    reflexed; petals round-oval to ovate, tapering to narrow,\r\n    short, white claws; filaments three-eighths inch long, equal to\r\n    the petals in length; pistil pubescent about the ovary, equal\r\n    to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, two and three-eighths inches wide, round or round-oval,\r\n    somewhat truncate, with halves usually equal; cavity shallow,\r\n    narrow, abrupt or flaring, contracted; suture shallow; apex\r\n    roundish, usually with a slightly recurved, mucronate tip;\r\n    color pale green changing to creamy-white, with splashes of\r\n    carmine mingled with a blush of darker red; pubescence short,\r\n    thick; skin tough, adherent to the pulp; flesh white, tinged\r\n    red at the pit, very juicy, markedly tender, sweet, pleasant\r\n    flavored; very good; stone semi-free to free, one and one-half\r\n    inches long, about one inch wide, oval, long-pointed, with\r\n    deeply grooved surfaces; ventral suture furrowed deeply along\r\n    the sides, wide; dorsal suture deeply furrowed, rather wide,\r\n    with sides slightly wing-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILI\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Chili, in its day, was\r\none of the notable culinary peaches, being especially desirable for\r\ncanning and curing because of its firm, dry, but well-flavored flesh,\r\nand, besides, it ripened late in the season when cool weather gave\r\nstorage conditions and made culinary work more agreeable to housewives.\r\nThe peaches are not at all attractive in size, color or shape, are\r\nquite too dry of flesh to eat with pleasure out of hand and are made\r\neven less agreeable to sight and taste by pubescence so heavy as to be\r\nwoolly. The trees of Chili are about all that could be desired, for,\r\nwhile of but medium size, they are vigorous, very hardy, long-lived\r\nand, barring injury from cold or frost, are annually fruitful, though\r\nthe variety has the fault of ripening its crop unevenly--an asset in\r\nhome orchards, a liability in commercial plantings.\r\n\r\nChili came into cultivation early in the Nineteenth Century, the first\r\ntree probably having appeared in the orchard of Deacon Pitman Wilcox,\r\nChili, Monroe County, New York. It comes almost true to seed and\r\nseveral seedlings have sprung up which are almost indistinguishable\r\nfrom it. Among these are Sugar, Stanley Late, Jenny Lind and Cass.\r\nChili was mentioned by the American Pomological Society in 1856 as a\r\nworthy sort under the name \"Hill's Chili\"; placed under this name on\r\nthe fruit list in 1873; and changed to Chili in 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHILI]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, compact, vigorous, upright-spreading,\r\n    hardy, productive; trunk thick, shaggy; branches stocky,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown covered with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    unusually long, with spur-like branches near the tips, dark\r\n    reddish-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous,\r\n    raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward and recurved, six inches long, one and\r\n    one-half inches wide, long-oval to obovate-lanceolate, thin;\r\n    upper surface dark, dull olive-green, smooth; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with two to seven\r\n    small, usually reniform, reddish-brown glands mostly on the\r\n    petiole.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small, short, obtuse, plump, pubescent, nearly\r\n    free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers pink, one and\r\n    one-half inches across, well distributed; pedicels short,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube red at the base, orange-colored\r\n    within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, medium to\r\n    broad, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals oval,\r\n    faintly notched near the base, tapering to short claws of\r\n    medium width, tinged with red at the base; filaments one-half\r\n    inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent near the\r\n    base, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late; two and one-half inches long, two and one-fourth\r\n    inches wide, oblong-conic, somewhat angular, compressed,\r\n    with unequal halves; cavity uneven, shallow, medium to wide,\r\n    contracted, abrupt or flaring, the skin tender and tearing\r\n    easily; suture shallow, sometimes extending beyond the apex;\r\n    apex slightly pointed; color greenish-yellow changing to\r\n    orange-yellow, with a dark red blush, splashed and mottled\r\n    with red; pubescence long, thick, coarse; skin thin, tough,\r\n    separates from the pulp; flesh stained red at the pit,\r\n    yellowish, dry, stringy, firm but tender, mild but sprightly;\r\n    good in quality; stone free, one and one-half inches long,\r\n    fifteen-sixteenths inch wide, flattened wedge-like at the base,\r\n    oval to obovate, winged, usually without bulge, long-pointed at\r\n    the apex, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed,\r\n    wide; dorsal suture deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE CLING\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

The variety is not now\r\nremarkable for either fruit- or tree-characters, being surpassed\r\nin both by many of its offspring, except, possibly, in quality. The\r\nflavor is delicious, being finely balanced between sweetness and\r\nsourness, with sweet predominating, and with a most distinct, curious\r\nand pleasant taste of the almond. The fruits are too tender for\r\nshipment and very subject to brown-rot. The trees are weak-growers,\r\nshy-bearers, tender to cold and susceptible to leaf-curl. Chinese\r\nCling created a sensation in pomology when it was brought to America\r\nbecause it was very different from any other peach then here and was\r\nsuperior to any other in several characters. Its seedlings quickly came\r\ninto prominence with the result that possibly a hundred or more of the\r\nvarieties named in _The Peaches of New York_ have descended from it.\r\nThe attempt to hold it and its seedlings in a distinct group fails, as\r\nwe have tried to show in discussing groups of peaches, because through\r\nhybridization they are hopelessly confused with other stocks. The\r\ncolor-plate is an excellent illustration of Chinese Cling.\r\n\r\nChinese Cling was found growing in the orchards south of the city of\r\nShanghai, China, by Robert Fortune, the indefatigable English botanist,\r\nwho was sent to China by the London Horticultural Society to collect\r\nuseful and ornamental plants. Fortune sent the peach to England in\r\n1844 under the name Shanghai, a name which it retains, with variable\r\nspellings, in Europe. Chinese Cling was imported as potted plants to\r\nAmerica in 1850 by Charles Downing through a Mr. Winchester, British\r\nconsul at Shanghai, China. Downing forwarded one of the trees to Henry\r\nLyons, Laurel Park, Columbia, South Carolina, with whom the variety\r\nfirst fruited in America. Lyons called the new fruit \"Chinese Peach.\"\r\nIn 1871 the American Pomological Society placed Chinese Cling on its\r\nrecommended list of varieties, a place it still holds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE CLING]\r\n\r\n    Tree rather weak in growth, upright-spreading, round-topped,\r\n    not very hardy, medium in productiveness; trunk thick; branches\r\n    stocky, reddish-brown mingled with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    with short internodes, olive-green more or less overlaid with\r\n    dark red, smooth, glabrous, with numerous large and very small,\r\n    inconspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves seven and one-half inches long, two inches wide, folded\r\n    upward, broad oval-lanceolate, thick, leathery; upper surface\r\n    dark green, smooth, becoming slightly rugose along the midrib;\r\n    lower surface light grayish-green; margin coarsely crenate to\r\n    finely serrate, tipped with dark red glands; petiole one-half\r\n    inch long, with two to five reniform, greenish-yellow,\r\n    dark-tipped glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, long, obtuse, plump, very pubescent,\r\n    somewhat appressed; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers\r\n    pink, one and one-half inches across, well distributed;\r\n    pedicels short, glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green;\r\n    calyx-lobes medium to broad, obtuse, glabrous within, heavily\r\n    pubescent near the outer edges; petals ovate, irregularly\r\n    notched near the base, tapering to short, white claws;\r\n    filaments one-fourth inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the base, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and five-eighths inches long, two and\r\n    nine-sixteenths inches wide, round-oval, compressed; cavity\r\n    deep, contracted, narrow, abrupt, faintly tinged with red;\r\n    suture deep, extending beyond the apex; apex roundish or\r\n    flattened, with a mucronate tip; color greenish-white changing\r\n    to creamy-white, blushed on one side with lively red, splashed\r\n    and marbled with duller red; pubescence thick; skin tough,\r\n    adhering to the pulp; flesh white, tinged with red near the\r\n    pit, juicy, meaty, tender, sweet but sprightly, aromatic; good\r\n    in quality; stone clinging, one and three-eighths inches long,\r\n    one inch wide, oval, conspicuously winged, bulged on one side,\r\n    with pitted surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed along the\r\n    sides, rather narrow; dorsal suture large, deep, wide, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE FREE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ala.

On our grounds, however,\r\nleaves, flowers and fruits are all smaller and the quality of the fruit\r\nis not nearly as good while the tree runs a little better in most\r\ncharacters. This, perhaps, is a good example of many of the seedlings\r\nof Chinese Cling--the influence of another parent and the stimulus of\r\nhybridization are apparent. Chinese Free is surpassed by many other\r\nwhite-fleshed peaches of its season for both home and market. Doubt\r\nhas arisen as to whether the tree on the Station grounds is the true\r\nChinese Free, yet we think it is the variety now commonly going under\r\nthis name.\r\n\r\nThis variety grew from a seed of Chinese Cling in the orchard of W. P.\r\nRobinson, Atlanta, Georgia, nearly forty years ago. Mr. Robinson first\r\nexhibited it before the Georgia Horticultural Society in 1881 as an\r\nunnamed seedling. Thereafter it was sometimes known locally as Robinson\r\nbut commercially it has always been called Chinese Free. In 1891 the\r\nGeorgia Horticultural Society formally adopted the latter name. The\r\nAmerican Pomological Society listed Chinese Free on its fruit-list in\r\n1891 but dropped it in 1897. In 1909, however, another change in heart\r\ncaused the Society's officials again to list it in the catalog where it\r\nstill remains.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, vigorous, spreading, the lower\r\n    branches slightly drooping, open-topped, neither very hardy\r\n    nor very productive; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown tinged with light ash-gray; branchlets slender,\r\n    inclined to rebranch, long, dark red intermingled with\r\n    olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous large,\r\n    conspicuous lenticels raised toward the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and three-fourths inches long, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval-lanceolate, medium in\r\n    thickness and toughness; upper surface dark green, rugose along\r\n    the midrib; lower surface dull grayish-green; margin finely\r\n    serrate, tipped with dark red glands; petiole three-eighths\r\n    inch long, with two to six rather large, reniform,\r\n    greenish-yellow, dark-tipped glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds usually obtuse, plump, very pubescent, somewhat\r\n    appressed; blooming season early; flowers pale pink, darker\r\n    along the edges, one and one-fourth inches across, often\r\n    in twos; pedicels short, glabrous, green; calyx-tube dull,\r\n    dark reddish-green, light yellow within, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes acute, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals\r\n    oval or ovate, tapering to small, narrow claws tinged with red\r\n    at the base; filaments one-half inch long, usually shorter than\r\n    the petals; pistil pubescent at the ovary, often longer than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-half inches long, two\r\n    and three-fourths inches wide, roundish-oval, bulged at one\r\n    side, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity narrow, abrupt,\r\n    tinged with red, with tender skin; suture shallow but deepening\r\n    at the apex; apex roundish or pointed, with a mucronate tip;\r\n    color greenish-white changing to creamy-white, blushed with\r\n    red, mottled and striped with darker red; pubescence very\r\n    short, thin; skin thin, tough, separates from the pulp; flesh\r\n    greenish-white or whitish, stained with red at the pit,\r\n    juicy, tender, melting, subacid, sprightly; fair to possibly\r\n    good in quality; stone free, one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    fifteen-sixteenths inch wide, oval, plump, abruptly pointed,\r\n    with purplish-brown, pitted surfaces; ventral suture deeply\r\n    furrowed along the sides, winged near the base, rather wide;\r\n    dorsal suture deeply grooved, wing-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMAX\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

The trees on the grounds of this Station seem as hardy\r\nas the average and are as productive. Whether or not the peaches are\r\nas large and as attractive here as in Florida, where the variety is\r\na commercial sort, we cannot say but certain it is, Climax has no\r\ncommercial value in New York. The peaches are small, unattractive in\r\ncolor, drop badly, are disfigured by peach-scab and have only honeyed\r\nsweetness to recommend them. We figure and describe the variety in full\r\nonly to show that honey-fleshed peaches can be grown this far north and\r\nto call attention to the possibility and desirability of using peaches\r\nof this stock in breeding to improve the quality or give new flavors to\r\nnorthern peaches. It would, too, give pleasant variety and add quality\r\nto the home orchard.\r\n\r\nClimax is a seedling of Honey but neither the date of origin nor the\r\nname of the originator is known. The variety was introduced by G. L.\r\nTaber, Glen Saint Mary, Florida, in 1886. The American Pomological\r\nSociety added Climax to its fruit-list in 1891 but dropped it in 1899.\r\nIn 1909, however, the variety was replaced in the Society's catalog as\r\na peach of merit for the South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLIMAX]\r\n\r\n    Tree small, vigorous, upright-spreading, round-topped,\r\n    dense, productive; trunk roughish; branches roughened by the\r\n    lenticels, reddish-brown covered with gray; branchlets very\r\n    slender, long, with short internodes, olive-green overspread\r\n    with darker red, smooth, glabrous, with very few small,\r\n    inconspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and three-eighths inches wide,\r\n    flattened, lanceolate, thin, leathery; upper surface dull,\r\n    medium green, smooth; lower surface olive-green; margin bluntly\r\n    serrate, glandular; petiole three-eighths inch long, slender,\r\n    glandless or with one to four small, reniform glands usually at\r\n    the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small and short, conical, plump, pubescent,\r\n    appressed; blooming season late; flowers pale pink, one inch\r\n    across; pedicels slender, glabrous, green; calyx-tube dotted\r\n    reddish-green, greenish-yellow within, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes acute or obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent\r\n    without, partly erect; petals ovate or oval, tapering to narrow\r\n    claws whitish at the base; filaments shorter than the petals;\r\n    pistil shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and three-eighths inches\r\n    long, two and one-eighth inches thick, oval, but slightly\r\n    compressed, with unequal sides; cavity usually shallow flaring,\r\n    splashed with red; suture shallow, deepening toward the apex;\r\n    apex conic, with a long, swollen, often recurved tip; color\r\n    greenish-white or creamy-white, occasionally with a blush or\r\n    faint mottlings of red toward the base; pubescence short,\r\n    thick; skin thin, adherent to the pulp; flesh white, stained\r\n    with red near the pit, juicy, stringy, melting, very sweet,\r\n    mild; very good in quality; stone semi-free to free, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches long, thirteen-sixteenths inch wide, oval,\r\n    plump, bulged on one side, long-pointed at the apex, with\r\n    pitted and grooved, reddish-brown surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    deeply furrowed along the sides, narrow; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSBY\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

It is\r\ndoubtful, however, whether it is hardier than other peaches of its kind\r\nas Chili, Smock and Heath Cling. Besides hardiness, the trees have to\r\nrecommend them vigor, health and productiveness, the latter character\r\noffset somewhat by small size. The quality of the fruit is excellent.\r\nThe rich, yellow, freestone flesh is delicious to the taste either as a\r\ndessert or as a culinary fruit. In these days of showy fruits, however,\r\nCrosby falls far short in appearance, the peaches running small, being\r\nsomewhat irregular and covered with dense tomentum. Still, at its\r\nbest, in soils to which it is perfectly suited, the peaches are often\r\nhandsome. But there lies another fault, the variety accommodates\r\nitself but poorly to trying soils and climates, failing especially in\r\nhungry soils and dark climates. The variety is noted for its willowy\r\ngrowth, small leaves, small flowers, small pits and, as has been said,\r\nhardiness. It is an ideal home sort.\r\n\r\nCrosby was sent out about 1876 by a Mr. Crosby, a nurseryman of\r\nBillerica, Massachusetts. Later the Massachusetts Agricultural College\r\npropagated and distributed it in a small way in northern Massachusetts\r\nwhere it was known as Excelsior. The fact that there was another\r\nvariety called Excelsior made a change necessary and the peach was\r\nrenamed in honor of Mr. Crosby. The American Pomological Society placed\r\nCrosby on its list of recommended varieties in 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSBY]\r\n\r\n    Tree small, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, with lower\r\n    branches slightly drooping, unusually hardy, very productive;\r\n    trunk thick; branches of medium size, smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    overspread with light ash-gray; branchlets slender, inclined\r\n    to rebranch, long, olive-green almost overspread with dark\r\n    red, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous large and small,\r\n    conspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves rather small and narrow, five and three-fourths inches\r\n    long, one and one-fourth inches wide, folded upward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thin; upper surface dark green, smooth;\r\n    lower surface light grayish-green; margin finely serrate\r\n    or crenate, tipped with dark brownish-red glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, with two to seven rather small,\r\n    reniform, greenish-yellow glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small, short, conical, pubescent, appressed;\r\n    flowers appear in mid-season; blossoms pale pink, darker\r\n    near the edges, nearly one inch across, well distributed;\r\n    pedicels very short, thick; calyx-tube dull reddish-green,\r\n    orange-colored within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    short, narrow, acute, glabrous within, pubescent without;\r\n    petals oval, tapering to long, narrow claws often red at the\r\n    base; filaments three-eighths inch long, equal to the petals in\r\n    length; pistil pubescent at the ovary, equal to or sometimes\r\n    longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and three-fourths inches long, two\r\n    and three-eighths inches thick, roundish or roundish-oblate,\r\n    slightly compressed, bulged near the apex, with unequal sides;\r\n    cavity deep, abrupt or flaring, sometimes splashed with red;\r\n    suture shallow, becoming deeper near the apex and extending\r\n    beyond; apex roundish, with a sunken, mucronate tip; color\r\n    orange-yellow, often blushed over much of the surface with dull\r\n    red, splashed and striped with darker red; pubescence long,\r\n    thick, coarse; skin thick, tough, adherent to the pulp; flesh\r\n    deep yellow, stained with red near the pit, juicy, stringy,\r\n    firm but tender, sweet, mild, pleasant flavored; very good in\r\n    quality; stone free, one and five-sixteenths inches long, one\r\n    inch wide, oval, plump, bulged near the apex, with pitted and\r\n    grooved surfaces; ventral suture with shallow furrows along the\r\n    sides; dorsal suture deeply grooved, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVIDSON\r\n\r\n    =1.= Harrison & Sons _Cat._ 16. 1905. =2.= _Mo.

Still, it comes so highly recommended that we\r\ngive it a place among the major varieties in _The Peaches of New York_\r\nhoping that the growers of the State will at least try it out. It is a\r\nwhite-fleshed peach similar to the well-known Rivers, larger in size,\r\nbut not quite as early. The trees are very hardy, come into bearing\r\nearly and bear heavily but ripen their crop unevenly. The peaches,\r\nas the color-plate shows, are handsome, and for a variety of early\r\nseason they are particularly good in quality but are very susceptible\r\nto brown-rot, peach-scab, leaf-curl and seemingly all the other ills\r\npeach-flesh is heir to.\r\n\r\nDavidson originated with G. W. Davidson, Shelby, Michigan, and is\r\nsupposed to be a sport of Early Michigan, being very similar to that\r\nsort in all respects except season, Davidson being two weeks earlier.\r\nIt is often confused with Eureka.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVIDSON]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, upright-spreading, hardy, productive; trunk thick;\r\n    branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown covered with ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets dull red strongly colored with olive-green, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous small, conspicuous lenticels raised\r\n    toward the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and three-fourths inches long, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate; upper\r\n    surface dark green, smooth or slightly rugose; lower surface\r\n    light grayish-green; margin broadly crenate or coarsely\r\n    serrate, tipped with dark red glands; petiole one-half\r\n    inch long, glandless or with one to five small, reniform,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds conical, pubescent, plump, appressed; blooming\r\n    season early; flowers pink, one and three-fourths inches\r\n    across, well distributed; pedicels nearly sessile, glabrous,\r\n    green; calyx-tube dull reddish-green, yellowish-green\r\n    within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes medium in length,\r\n    narrow, acute, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals\r\n    roundish-ovate, often broadly notched near the base, tapering\r\n    to short, broad claws occasionally with a red base; filaments\r\n    one-half inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent\r\n    at the ovary, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; two and one-half inches long, two\r\n    and three-eighths inches wide, roundish, bulged near the\r\n    apex, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity contracted,\r\n    deep, narrow, abrupt; suture shallow, becoming deep at the\r\n    extremities; apex roundish, with a small, mucronate tip; color\r\n    creamy-white blushed with dull red, indistinctly striped with\r\n    darker red; pubescence short, thick; skin tough, separates\r\n    from the pulp; flesh white, juicy, stringy, tender, melting,\r\n    sweet or with some sprightliness; fair to good in quality;\r\n    stone semi-free to free, one and three-eighths inches long,\r\n    one inch wide, oval, plump, tapering to a short, abrupt point,\r\n    bulged near the apex, contracted toward the base, with grooved,\r\n    light-colored surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed along\r\n    the sides, narrow, winged; dorsal suture winged, grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY CRAWFORD\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kenrick _Am.

The\r\npeach has all of the characters that gratify the taste--richness of\r\nflavor, pleasant aroma, tender flesh and abundant juice. Besides being\r\none of the very best in quality it is one of the handsomest peaches.\r\nUnfortunately, this Station is one of the many places in which Early\r\nCrawford is not at home and the accompanying illustration is far from\r\ndoing the variety justice in size, shape or color. At their best, the\r\nfruits are larger, more rotund and more richly colored than shown in\r\n_The Peaches of New York_. In soils to which it is well adapted the\r\npeach is large, often very large, roundish-oblong, slightly compressed,\r\ndistinguished by its broad, deep cavity, rich red in the sun, splashed\r\nand mottled with darker red, and golden yellow in the shade. The\r\nflesh is a beautiful, marbled yellow, rayed with red at the pit and\r\nperfectly free from the stone. The trees are all that could be desired\r\nin health, vigor, size and shape but are unproductive and uncertain and\r\ntardy in bearing. Yet with these faults Early Crawford, for at least\r\na half-century, was the leading market peach of its season giving way\r\nfinally to white-fleshed sorts of the Belle, Carman and Greensboro\r\ntype. Fast passing from commercial importance, Early Crawford ought\r\nlong to be grown in home plantations because of the beauty and\r\nunexcelled quality of the fruit.\r\n\r\nEarly Crawford came into existence in the orchard of William Crawford,\r\nMiddletown, New Jersey, early in the Nineteenth Century. Its merits\r\nwere first set forth by William Kenrick in the _American Orchardist_\r\nin 1832. The variety in some manner found its way to Europe and came\r\ninto the hands of Ferdinand Gaillard, a nurseryman at Brignais, Rhone,\r\nFrance, but without a name. Gaillard, believing it to be a new sort,\r\ngave it the name Willermoz in honor of M. Willermoz, Secretary of the\r\nPomological Congress of France. Later, French pomologists decided\r\nthat Gaillard's peach and Early Crawford were identical. The American\r\nPomological Society put this peach on its fruit-list in 1856 under the\r\nname Crawford's Early. The name has several times been varied but today\r\nthe variety is listed as Early Crawford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY CRAWFORD]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, round-topped,\r\n    often unproductive; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown very lightly tinged with ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    with internodes of medium length, pinkish-red intermingled with\r\n    darker red, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous large and\r\n    small, conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and\r\n    one-half inches wide, folded upward and recurved, oval\r\n    to obovate-lanceolate, medium in thickness, leathery;\r\n    upper surface dark green, usually smooth except along the\r\n    prominent midrib; lower surface light grayish-green; margin\r\n    finely serrate, often in two series, tipped with very fine,\r\n    reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    glandless or with one to five small, globose, greenish-yellow\r\n    glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds conical, heavily pubescent, free; blossoms appear\r\n    in mid-season; flowers pale pink, less than one inch across,\r\n    well distributed; pedicels very short, thick, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-colored within, obconic;\r\n    calyx-lobes short, medium to narrow, acute, glabrous within,\r\n    pubescent without; petals oval, broadly notched near the base,\r\n    tapering to broad claws red at the base; filaments one-fourth\r\n    inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil often longer\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-half inches\r\n    long, two and nine-sixteenths inches wide, round-oval or\r\n    cordate, bulged near the apex, compressed, with unequal halves;\r\n    cavity deep, wide, abrupt; suture shallow, becoming deeper\r\n    near the apex; apex variable in shape, often with a swollen,\r\n    elongated tip; color golden-yellow, blushed with dark red,\r\n    splashed and mottled with deeper red; pubescence thick; skin\r\n    separates from the pulp; flesh deep yellow, rayed with red near\r\n    the pit, juicy, tender, pleasantly sprightly, highly flavored;\r\n    very good in quality; stone free, one and one-half inches long,\r\n    one inch wide, oval or ovate, bulged along one side, medium\r\n    plump, with small, shallow pits in the surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    deeply furrowed along the sides, medium in width, winged;\r\n    dorsal suture grooved, slightly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY YORK\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kenrick _Am.

As the history which follows shows, it\r\nwas one of the first named varieties to be grown in this country.\r\nIt is of more than passing interest, too, because it is one of\r\nthe few sorts with glandless leaves. The fruits of Early York are\r\ninsignificant, though the color-plate hardly does the variety justice,\r\nbut the vigorous, healthy, compact trees have much to recommend them\r\nso that the variety might be used as a stepping-stone in improving\r\ntree-characters of peaches.\r\n\r\nNo doubt several distinct varieties have been grown as Early York.\r\nLarge York, for example, which originated with Prince at Flushing,\r\nNew York, has probably been more often sold for Early York than any\r\nother sort. Early Purple, a very old peach of European origin, was\r\nintroduced to America about the time Early York came to notice. In\r\nsome manner this variety has been confused with Early York, the name\r\noften being given as a synonym of that variety. The two sorts, however,\r\nare distinct and the error of connecting the name has led to much\r\nmisunderstanding. Early Purple disappeared from American cultivation\r\nsoon after its introduction and peaches sold under this name today are\r\nprobably Early York. A controversy has arisen as to the origin of Early\r\nYork, both America and England having been given as its home. That\r\nEarly York is of American origin, however, there can be little doubt.\r\nIts parentage, the time and place of origin, however, are unknown. It\r\nmay have come in existence in New York, or possibly New Jersey or,\r\nas some have thought, near York, Pennsylvania. The variety was sent\r\nto Europe about the middle of the Nineteenth Century where Thomas\r\nRivers grew it at Sawbridgeworth and from it raised several promising\r\nseedlings. The leaves of the variety are distinctly serrated, giving\r\nrise to the name Serrate Early York. Red Rareripe, another variety\r\nhaving serrated, glandless leaves, has often been confused with Early\r\nYork. The two are very similar but the fruit of Red Rareripe is larger,\r\nbroader and ripens about a week later. Early York was placed on the\r\nlist of recommended fruits at the National Convention of Fruit-Growers\r\nin 1848 and since that time has had a place on the fruit-list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY YORK]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, compact, upright-spreading, unproductive; trunk\r\n    stocky; branches thick, smooth, reddish-brown tinged with\r\n    light ash-gray; branchlets very long, dark pinkish-red with\r\n    some green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous, raised\r\n    lenticels variable in size, numerous at the base and well\r\n    scattered along the branches.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and one-half inches wide, folded\r\n    upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate; upper surface dark green,\r\n    smooth becoming slightly rugose along the midrib; lower\r\n    surface light grayish-green; margin sharply serrate, tipped\r\n    with reddish-brown glands; petiole seven-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    glandless.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds conical or pointed, heavily pubescent, free;\r\n    blossoms open very late; flowers seven-eighths inch across,\r\n    pale pink, the edges darker; pedicels short, glabrous,\r\n    green; calyx-tube reddish-green, yellow within, campanulate;\r\n    calyx-lobes short, narrow, acute or obtuse, glabrous within,\r\n    pubescent without; petals roundish-oval, broadly notched,\r\n    tapering to short claws of medium width, sometimes stained with\r\n    red at the base; filaments three-eighths inch long, shorter\r\n    than the petals; pistil pubescent at the ovary, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two inches long, two and\r\n    one-fourth inches wide, roundish to nearly oblate, somewhat\r\n    oblique, with unequal halves; cavity shallow, flaring, with\r\n    tender skin, often tinged with red; suture shallow, extending\r\n    beyond the tip; apex variable in shape, with mucronate or\r\n    sometimes mamelon tip; color pale white or creamy-white,\r\n    blushed and mottled with carmine; pubescence thin, short;\r\n    skin tough, adherent to the pulp until fully ripe; flesh\r\n    white, rayed with red near the pit, juicy, stringy, tender and\r\n    melting, mild subacid; good in quality; stone nearly free, over\r\n    one inch long, three-fourths inch wide, oval, plump, flattened\r\n    at the base, short-pointed at the apex, with pitted surfaces\r\n    marked by few grooves; ventral suture narrow, with furrows of\r\n    medium depth along the sides; dorsal suture deeply grooved.\r\n\r\nEDGEMONT\r\n\r\n    =1.= Harrison & Sons _Cat._ 18. 1901.\r\n\r\n    _Edgemont Beauty._ =2.= Barnes Bros. _Cat._ 7. 1910. =3.= _Md.\r\n    Sta.

The\r\ntrees differ, chiefly, in the greater productiveness of Edgemont and\r\nin a little later maturity of the crop. Of the score or more peaches\r\nof the Crawford type, in many respects the best of the several types\r\nof peaches, Edgemont is distinctly superior to all on our grounds.\r\nCompared with Elberta, with which it must compete in the markets, it\r\nis several days later, is juicier, less fibrous, much excels that\r\nvariety in quality and, though the individual peaches are not quite as\r\nlarge, at Geneva the yield of fruit is even greater. If Edgemont proves\r\nadapted to as wide a range of climates and soils as Elberta, we shall\r\nhave a new commercial peach of very great value. Whether it succeeds in\r\ncommerce or not, Edgemont is well worth planting in home orchards by\r\nvirtue of the exceptionally high quality and attractive appearance of\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\nEdgemont, shortened from Edgemont Beauty, in accordance with the rules\r\nof the American Pomological Society, is of rather recent origin, having\r\nbeen introduced by the Miller Orchard Company, Edgemont, Maryland, in\r\n1902.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDGEMONT]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, productive; trunk\r\n    stocky, smooth; branches thick, smooth; branchlets medium in\r\n    thickness, purplish-red mingled with brown.\r\n\r\n    Leaves large, obovate, medium in thickness; upper surface\r\n    yellowish-green, somewhat wrinkled; margin crenate; glands\r\n    globose.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds half-hardy, medium in size; flowers appear in\r\n    mid-season, small, dark pink, well distributed, single;\r\n    pedicels short, somewhat slender; petals ovate, entire;\r\n    filaments long, sometimes longer than the petals.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in late mid-season; large, irregular,\r\n    roundish-ovate, truncate at the base, with unequal halves;\r\n    cavity rather deep, medium to narrow, regular, abrupt; suture\r\n    shallow; apex mucronate; color light yellow or orange-yellow,\r\n    with a bronze blush often deepening to an attractive carmine\r\n    blush; pubescence short, medium in thickness; skin thick,\r\n    somewhat tough, separates from the pulp; flesh yellow, stained\r\n    red at the pit, very juicy, slightly coarse and stringy, meaty,\r\n    mild subacid or sprightly; very good in quality; stone free,\r\n    large, oval, plump, pointed, with corrugated surfaces.\r\n\r\nELBERTA\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

A\r\nstudy of the variety, though it reveals some shortcomings, justifies\r\nits popularity with orchardists and marketmen. The preeminently\r\nmeritorious character of Elberta is its freedom from local prejudices\r\nof either soil or climate--it is the cosmopolite of cultivated\r\npeaches. Thus, Elberta is grown with profit in every peach-growing\r\nstate in the Union and in nearly all, if not all, is grown in\r\ngreater quantities than any other market peach. The second character\r\nwhich commends Elberta to those in the business of peach-growing is\r\nfruitfulness--barring frosts or freezes the trees load themselves\r\nwith fruit year in and year out. Added to these two great points of\r\nsuperiority are ability to withstand, in fair measure at least, the\r\nravages of both insects and fungi, large size, vigor, early bearing and\r\nlongevity in tree, and large, handsome, well-flavored fruits which ship\r\nand keep remarkably well.\r\n\r\nElberta, however, is not without faults and serious ones. The trees are\r\nnot as hardy in either wood or blossom as might be wished. In northern\r\nregions peaches of the Crosby, Chili, Smock and Wager type stand winter\r\nfreezes and spring frosts much better. The blossoms open rather too\r\nearly in New York. The peaches also fall short in quality. They lack\r\nthe richness of the Crawfords and the sweetness of the white-fleshed\r\nChampion type. Moreover, the pronounced bitter tang, even when the\r\npeaches are fully ripe, is disagreeable to some. Picked green and\r\nallowed to ripen in the markets, Elberta is scarcely edible by those\r\nwho know good peaches. The stone is large but is usually wholly free\r\nfrom the flesh. With these faults, the dominance of Elberta is not\r\nwholly desirable as growers have a feeling of sufficiency with the one\r\nvariety and consumers are forced to put up with a peach none too high\r\nin quality. Still, since no other variety is so reliable for the trade,\r\nthis, by the way, being about the only variety suitable for export by\r\nreason of shipping qualities, Elberta promises long to continue its\r\ncommercial supremacy.\r\n\r\nElberta was grown by Samuel H. Rumph, Marshallville, Georgia, from a\r\nseed of Chinese Cling planted in the fall of 1870. The Chinese Cling\r\ntree stood near Early and Late Crawford trees and trees of Oldmixon\r\nFree and Oldmixon Cling. Mr. Rumph believed that the Chinese Cling\r\nblossom which produced Elberta was fertilized by pollen from Early\r\nCrawford. The seedling was named Elberta in honor of Mr. Rumph's wife,\r\nClara Elberta Rumph. An interesting coincidence connected with the\r\norigin of Elberta is that another stone from the same Chinese Cling\r\ntree was given to L. A. Rumph and from this grew Belle, the splendid\r\nwhite-fleshed, freestone peach. Nurserymen and growers frequently\r\nproduce strains of Elberta which they think superior to the older sort\r\nbut the several strains which have been tested on the grounds of this\r\nStation have not proved to differ a whit from the old variety. From\r\nthe number of so-called \"Early Elbertas\" and \"Late Elbertas\" it may be\r\nsuspected that occasionally Elberta, because of some local condition,\r\nripens its fruit prematurely, or that ripening may be delayed; when\r\nremoved from the particular local environment, ripening time seems\r\nto occur normally. Elberta was placed on the American Pomological\r\nSociety's fruit-list in 1889.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELBERTA]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    very productive; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown intermingled with light ash-gray; branchlets with\r\n    tendency to rebranch, with long internodes, olive-green lightly\r\n    overspread with dark red, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous conspicuous lenticels variable in size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, oval to obovate-lanceolate; upper surface dull,\r\n    dark olive-green, mottled and somewhat rugose; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely to coarsely serrate, often in two\r\n    series, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths\r\n    inch long, with one to six reniform, greenish-yellow glands\r\n    medium in size and variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, pubescent, conical or obtuse, plump,\r\n    appressed; flowers appear in mid-season; blossoms light\r\n    pink near the center, darker pink toward the edges, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches across; pedicels short, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-colored within, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes acute, glabrous within, pubescent\r\n    without; petals oval to ovate, bluntly notched near the base,\r\n    tapering to broad, short claws red at the base; filaments\r\n    one-half inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent\r\n    at the ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and three-fourths inches long,\r\n    two and one-half inches wide, roundish-oblong or cordate,\r\n    compressed, usually with a slight bulge at one side; cavity\r\n    deep, abrupt to flaring, often mottled with red; suture\r\n    shallow, deepening toward the apex; apex roundish, with a\r\n    mamelon or pointed tip; color greenish-yellow changing to\r\n    orange-yellow, from one-fourth to three-fourths overspread with\r\n    red and with much mottling extending sometimes over nearly the\r\n    entire surface; pubescence thick and coarse; skin thick, tough,\r\n    separates from the pulp; flesh yellow, stained with red near\r\n    the pit, juicy, stringy, firm but tender, sweet or subacid,\r\n    mild; good in quality; stone free, one and eleven-sixteenths\r\n    inches long, one and one-sixteenth inches wide, broadly ovate,\r\n    varying from flat to plump, sharp-pointed, decidedly bulged on\r\n    one side, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed\r\n    along the sides, narrow, winged; dorsal suture deeply grooved,\r\n    strongly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

Before Elberta became the vogue, Engle stood high\r\nin the esteem of commercial planters in Michigan and its culture was\r\nrapidly spreading into other states but the coming of Elberta stopped\r\nits career. There seems little doubt but that Engle is more productive\r\nthan either of the two Crawfords, splendid peaches which fail because\r\nof unproductiveness, and for those who want the best it is as good as\r\nany of this group--quite too good to be lost. One of the faults of the\r\ntwo Crawfords is that the trees are tardy in coming in bearing. Engle\r\nis said to bear younger. On the Station grounds the fruit drops rather\r\ntoo readily but we do not find this fault mentioned by others.\r\n\r\nEngle was grown some forty years ago by C. C. Engle, Paw Paw,\r\nMichigan, with a number of seedlings, several others of which proved\r\nvaluable. Late Crawford may have been the seed parent but of this there\r\ncan be no certainty. The American Pomological Society added Engle to\r\nits list of recommended fruits in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLE]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, upright becoming spreading, tall, hardy,\r\n    medium in productiveness; trunk thick, variable in smoothness;\r\n    branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown covered with light\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets long, heavily tinged with olive-green,\r\n    glossy, smooth, somewhat tortuous, inclined to rebranch,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous small, conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and three-eighths\r\n    inches wide, irregularly curled, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thin; upper surface rather dark, dull olive-green, rugose\r\n    along the midrib; lower surface light grayish-green; apex\r\n    narrow-acuminate; petiole three-eighths inch long, with one to\r\n    four small, globose, greenish-yellow glands at the base of the\r\n    leaf.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large and long, conical, plump, pubescent, free;\r\n    blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers light pink at the\r\n    center, darker red near the edges, one and one-eighth inches\r\n    across; pedicels very short, glabrous, green; calyx-tube dull\r\n    reddish-green, orange-colored within, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, acute, glabrous within, heavily pubescent\r\n    without; petals oval to slightly ovate, faintly and broadly\r\n    crenate, tapering to claws with red base; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the ovary, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two inches long, two and\r\n    seven-sixteenths inches wide, round-oval to cordate, becoming\r\n    almost oblate in some specimens, bulged near the apex,\r\n    compressed, with unequal sides; cavity abrupt to flaring;\r\n    suture shallow, deepening toward the apex; apex variable\r\n    in shape; color greenish-yellow changing to orange-yellow,\r\n    in parts overspread with a bright red blush, splashed with\r\n    darker red; pubescence short, thick, fine; skin thin, tough,\r\n    separates readily from the pulp; flesh pale yellow, stained\r\n    with red near the pit, juicy, tender and melting, sweet or\r\n    pleasantly subacid, mild; good in quality; stone free, one\r\n    and five-sixteenths inches long, fifteen-sixteenths inch wide\r\n    ovate, bulged on one side, plump, with pitted surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture very deeply grooved along the edges; dorsal suture\r\n    grooved, often winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUREKA\r\n\r\n    =1.= _W.

In New\r\nYork the variety ripens early, when there are many other good peaches\r\nof its type, and it is therefore doubtful if it will ever have a\r\nprominent place in peach-growing in this State. As the variety grows on\r\nthe Station grounds, one quality, in particular, marks Eureka as worthy\r\nmore attention than it now receives--the peaches are exceptionally\r\nuniform in size. The color-plate, by the way, shows shape and color\r\nvery well but does not give a fair idea of the size, as the peaches\r\ngrow larger in average years.

The tree is doubtfully hardy and the fruit\r\nscabs badly. The variety has two characters to commend it and to give\r\nit standing among commercial peaches in New York: Compared with that\r\nof Champion, the fruit stands shipment much better and when brown-rot\r\nis rife, does not suffer nearly as much. In selected locations, then,\r\nwhen a mid-season, white-fleshed peach is wanted, this variety is worth\r\ntrying.\r\n\r\nFamily Favorite is a seedling of Chinese Cling, possibly crossed with\r\nOldmixon Free. It was raised by the late William H. Locke, Bonham,\r\nFannin County, Texas. The exact date of its origin is unknown. The\r\nvariety was named and introduced by T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas. The\r\nAmerican Pomological Society added Family Favorite to its list of\r\nfruits in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAMILY FAVORITE]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, spreading, inclined to droop, open-topped,\r\n    productive; trunk and branches intermediate in thickness;\r\n    branches reddish-brown with a tinge of very light ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets rather short, with internodes dark red intermingled\r\n    with olive-green, glossy, smooth, curving, with numerous medium\r\n    to small, conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, six inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, ovate-lanceolate; upper surface a dull, mottled, dark\r\n    green mingled with olive-green, rugose along the midrib; lower\r\n    surface light grayish-green; margin finely serrate, often\r\n    in two series, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, with one to four small, globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small, obtuse to pointed, very plump, heavily\r\n    pubescent, appressed; season of bloom early; flowers light\r\n    pink at the center, darker pink along the edges, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches across; pedicels short, glabrous; calyx-tube\r\n    reddish-green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes broad,\r\n    obtuse, pubescent within, heavily pubescent toward the edges;\r\n    petals oval to ovate, usually entire, tapering to narrow claws;\r\n    filaments one-half inch long, equal to the petals in length;\r\n    pistil pubescent at the base, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-half inches long, two\r\n    and three-eighths inches wide, roundish-oval to strongly oval,\r\n    bulged near the apex, compressed, with unequal sides; cavity\r\n    contracted, narrow, abrupt; suture a line, deepening toward\r\n    the apex; apex roundish, with a small, mucronate tip set in\r\n    a depression; color creamy-white, with a few splashes of red\r\n    showing through a dull and mottled blush; pubescence short,\r\n    thin; skin thin, tough; flesh greenish-white, strongly stained\r\n    with red at the pit, very juicy, tender and melting, sweet or\r\n    subacid, aromatic; good in quality; stone semi-free to free,\r\n    tinged with red, one and one-half inches long, one inch wide,\r\n    flattened near the base, elliptical, plump, winged on one side,\r\n    with roughish and usually pitted surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    deeply furrowed along the sides, narrow; dorsal suture grooved,\r\n    irregular.\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZGERALD\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Can.

There could be no use in growing Fitzgerald in this State,\r\nso similar is it to the better-known Early Crawford, were it not for\r\nthe fact that the two differ in season a few days and that possibly\r\nFitzgerald is the more productive of the two. Fitzgerald ripens a few\r\ndays earlier than Early Crawford though in some of the references given\r\nit is said to ripen a few days later. Canadian peach-growers claim that\r\nFitzgerald, besides being more productive and extending the season of\r\nEarly Crawford, is hardier. In the effort to maintain peaches of the\r\nCrawford family in commercial plantations it may be worth while to try\r\nFitzgerald.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald originated a quarter of a century or more ago at Oakville,\r\nOntario, but who the originator or what the parentage is not known.\r\nThe American Pomological Society placed Fitzgerald on its list of\r\nrecommended fruits in 1899, a place it still holds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FITZGERALD]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright-spreading, round-topped,\r\n    hardy, not very productive; trunk smooth; branches smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown covered with light ash-gray; branchlets long,\r\n    with inclination to develop short, spur-like branchlets,\r\n    pinkish-red or dark red intermingled with green, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous conspicuous, rather small lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and one-half inches wide, folded\r\n    upward but recurved, oval to obovate-lanceolate; upper surface\r\n    dark green tinged with olive-green, rugose; lower surface light\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, glandless or with one\r\n    to five small, globose, greenish-yellow glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, conical, pubescent, plump, free; blossoms\r\n    appear in mid-season; flowers pale pink varying to a deeper\r\n    red along the edges, seven-eighths inch across; pedicels very\r\n    short, slender, glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green,\r\n    orange-colored within, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow,\r\n    acute, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals\r\n    roundish-oval to ovate, white at the center, tapering to narrow\r\n    claws often red at the base; filaments one-fourth inch long,\r\n    equal to the petals in length; pistil pubescent at the ovary,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-half inches long, more\r\n    than two and one-half inches wide, roundish-oval to cordate,\r\n    somewhat compressed, with unequal halves, bulged at one side;\r\n    cavity medium to deep, wide, abrupt or often flaring, marked\r\n    with radiating streaks; suture shallow, deepening toward the\r\n    apex; apex roundish, ending in a recurved, mamelon point;\r\n    color golden-yellow more or less overspread with a dull red\r\n    blush, with splashes and mottlings of deeper red; pubescence\r\n    long, thick; skin thin, tough; flesh yellow, rayed with red at\r\n    the pit, juicy, rather firm, tender, sweet or mildly subacid,\r\n    pleasant flavored; very good in quality; stone free, one and\r\n    one-half inches long, one inch wide, ovate, plump, flattened\r\n    near the base, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture very deeply\r\n    furrowed along the sides; dorsal suture slightly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSTER\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

It is so similar\r\nto Late Crawford that even experienced growers can hardly tell them\r\napart. Those who grow the two in the same orchard find the essential\r\ndifferences to be: Foster is the larger peach, is more rotund, somewhat\r\nmore flattened at the base, is a little earlier, possibly handsomer\r\nand is even of better quality than Late Crawford; the trees of Foster,\r\nhowever, are hardly as productive as those of either of the two\r\nunproductive Crawfords. This unproductiveness is the fault that keeps\r\nthe variety in the background as a commercial peach. The variety is\r\nwell worth planting in any home orchard.\r\n\r\nFoster originated about 1857 with J. T. Foster, Medford, Massachusetts,\r\nfrom the stone of a peach purchased by him in a Boston market. It\r\nwas awarded a place on the American Pomological Society's list of\r\nrecommended fruits in 1869.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSTER]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, variable\r\n    in productiveness; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown intermingled with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    spur-like, long, dark pinkish-red mingled with olive-green,\r\n    glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous large and small\r\n    lenticels raised at the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and three-eighths inches wide,\r\n    folded upward, oval to obovate-lanceolate, intermediate\r\n    in thickness, leathery; upper surface dark green, smooth\r\n    becoming rugose near the midrib; lower surface grayish-green;\r\n    margin finely serrate, tipped with small glands; petiole\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long, with one to four small globose\r\n    glands variable in color and position; flower-buds somewhat\r\n    tender, conical or pointed, pubescent, free; blossoms appear in\r\n    mid-season.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and seven-sixteenths inches\r\n    long, more than two and one-half inches wide, round-cordate,\r\n    often bulged at one side, compressed, with unequal sides;\r\n    cavity deep, wide, flaring or somewhat abrupt, often splashed\r\n    with red; suture shallow, becoming deeper at both apex and\r\n    cavity and extending slightly beyond the point; apex roundish\r\n    or pointed, with a recurved, mamelon or occasionally mucronate\r\n    tip; color deep yellow overspread with dark red, with a few\r\n    splashes or stripes of red; pubescence long, thick; skin thick,\r\n    tough, separates from the pulp when fully ripe; flesh deep\r\n    yellow, faintly stained with red near the pit, juicy, coarse\r\n    and stringy, firm but tender, sweet, mild, spicy; very good in\r\n    quality; stone free.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL LEE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

It is without value in the North. Southern growers say General\r\nLee is an improved Chinese Cling and as such well worth growing under\r\nsome conditions. It has the reputation of being quite susceptible to\r\nbrown-rot. The variety is offered by a good many nurserymen and we\r\ndiscuss it only to condemn it for planting in New York. The variety,\r\nas its history shows, really belongs to eastern Asia and thus arouses\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee originated with Judge Campbell, Pensacola, Florida, from\r\npits brought from Japan in 1860. In 1864 P. J. Berckmans received buds\r\nfrom R. R. Hunley of Alabama and in 1867 introduced the sort under the\r\nname General Lee. The American Pomological Society listed this peach\r\nin 1889 as General Lee but in 1897 shortened the name to Lee and so it\r\nappears in the Society's catalog at the present time. We prefer the old\r\nname since when shortened it loses all significance as a commemorative\r\nappellation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL LEE]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, spreading, unproductive; trunk\r\n    thick, rough; branches reddish-brown tinged with light\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets slender, with internodes dark red mingled\r\n    with considerable green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous inconspicuous, raised lenticels variable in size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, flat or folded downward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thick, leathery; upper surface dark, dull green, smooth; lower\r\n    surface grayish-green; apex acuminate; margin coarsely serrate,\r\n    tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole nearly one-half inch\r\n    long, with one to four large, reniform, reddish-brown glands\r\n    variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds somewhat tender, large, conspicuous, very\r\n    plump, conical to obtuse, strongly pubescent, appressed or\r\n    slightly free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers one and\r\n    thirteen-sixteenths inches across, pink, well distributed;\r\n    pedicels short, glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green\r\n    at the base, greenish-yellow within, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent without;\r\n    petals narrow-oval, tapering to short, broad claws occasionally\r\n    with reddish base; filaments seven-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent near the base, longer\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and five-eighths inches\r\n    long, two and one-half inches wide, round or roundish-oval,\r\n    compressed, with halves equal; cavity deep, medium to wide,\r\n    contracted around the sides, abrupt or flaring, often mottled\r\n    with red; suture medium to deep, extending beyond the tip;\r\n    apex mucronate, mamelon; color greenish-white changing to\r\n    creamy-white, with a dull or lively red blush in which are\r\n    intermingled a few splashes of duller red; pubescence coarse,\r\n    long, thick; skin thick, tough, clings to the pulp; flesh\r\n    white, stained with red near the pit, juicy, stringy, tender,\r\n    sweet but sprightly, pleasantly flavored; good in quality;\r\n    stone clinging, one and five-sixteenths inches long, one inch\r\n    wide, bulged on one side, broadly oval to ovate, flattened,\r\n    short-pointed at the apex, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    winged, narrow, deeply grooved along the edges; dorsal suture\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE IV\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mas Le Verger_ =7=:49, 50, fig. 23. 1866-73. =2.= Leroy\r\n    _Dict.

This variety was one of the first\r\nnamed American peaches and had the honor of being placed on the\r\nrecommended list of fruits at the first meeting of the National\r\nConvention of Fruit-Growers, an organization which became the American\r\nPomological Society, in 1848. George IV is not worth planting now and\r\nis illustrated and described in _The Peaches of New York_ only that\r\nfruit-growers may note progress in the development of peaches. It is\r\ninteresting to note that this old American peach is still widely grown\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nGeorge IV has been confused with several other sorts, particularly\r\nMorris Red. Prince, in the _Magazine of Horticulture_, writes that\r\nMorris Red is an old Red Rareripe brought to America from Europe by\r\nHuguenot emigrants and that George IV came from buds of the original\r\ntree of this variety. The consensus of opinion, however, among those\r\nwho early knew both peaches, is that Morris Red and George IV are\r\ndistinct and that both are of American origin. George IV, the best\r\nauthorities say, sprang up as a chance seedling, about 1821, in the\r\ngarden of a Mr. Gill, Broad Street, New York City. After fruiting, the\r\nvariety rapidly grew in favor and within a few years was everywhere\r\ngrown in eastern America. Taken to Europe, it soon became one of the\r\nstandard European peaches. From the first it was on the list in the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society's fruit-catalog but was dropped in 1897 to\r\nbe replaced in 1909. We doubt if it now deserves to be recommended on\r\nany list of fruits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE IV]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, unproductive;\r\n    trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown covered\r\n    with light ash-gray; branchlets dark red, with faint traces of\r\n    green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous conspicuous,\r\n    small lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves seven inches long, one and five-eighths inches wide,\r\n    folded upward and recurved, oval to obovate-lanceolate, rather\r\n    thick, leathery; upper surface dark green, smooth except\r\n    near the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; margin sharply\r\n    serrate, red; petiole three-eighths inch long, glandless or\r\n    with one to three small, globose, reddish-brown glands usually\r\n    at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds short, obtuse, plump, heavily pubescent, appressed;\r\n    blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers pale pink, with white\r\n    centers and edged with darker pink, nearly one inch across;\r\n    pedicels nearly sessile; calyx-tube reddish-green, light yellow\r\n    within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes medium in length and\r\n    width, obtuse or acute, glabrous within, pubescent without;\r\n    petals roundish-oval, tapering to claws red at the base;\r\n    filaments one-fourth inch long, equal to the petals in length;\r\n    pistil longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and five-sixteenths inches\r\n    long, two and seven-sixteenths inches wide, roundish-oblate,\r\n    bulged near the apex, oblique, with unequal sides; cavity\r\n    slightly contracted, deep, wide, abrupt, with tender skin;\r\n    suture shallow, becoming deeper at both apex and cavity and\r\n    faintly showing beyond the tip; apex roundish, with a mucronate\r\n    tip; color greenish-white changing to creamy-white, with a pink\r\n    blush and sometimes with faint mottlings of red; pubescence\r\n    short, thick, fine; skin thin, tough, variable in adherence\r\n    to the pulp; flesh whitish, deeply tinged with red near the\r\n    pit, juicy, stringy, tender, mild, pleasantly flavored; good\r\n    in quality; stone semi-free to free, one and one-eighth inches\r\n    long, three-fourths inch thick, roundish-oval, very plump,\r\n    flattened at the base, tapering to a short, rounded point, with\r\n    grooved surfaces; ventral suture winged, rather narrow; dorsal\r\n    suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD DROP\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kan.

It is doubtfully worth planting in New York as\r\na peach of commerce but should find a place in every home orchard.\r\nThe variety has several distinctive peculiarities which make it a\r\npleasing variation in the peach-orchard and add to its merits as a home\r\nfruit. Thus, its transparent, golden skin and flesh make it one of\r\nthe handsomest of all peaches; add to handsome appearance a somewhat\r\ndistinctive flavor--vinous, rich, refreshing--and the peach becomes\r\none that all agree is very good and one that, were the size larger,\r\nwould sell in any market. Gold Drop is further characterized by great\r\nhardiness in tree and bud and by remarkable productiveness. Indeed,\r\nit loads itself so heavily that the peaches invariably run small\r\nunless the trees are heavily pruned and the crop thinned--small size\r\nof fruit is the greatest defect of the variety. Besides being one of\r\nthe hardiest of all peaches it is also about the least susceptible\r\nto brown-rot and leaf-curl, the two worst scourges of the peach when\r\nyellows permits the trees to live. Earliness in coming in bearing\r\nis another admirable character. The trees are of but medium size,\r\nare dainty in habits with clean, fresh foliage so that the variety\r\nis an attractive ornamental. All in all, Gold Drop is ideal for\r\nthe home garden and has many good characters which can be used as\r\nstepping-stones in breeding peaches.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Gold Drop is unknown. It is evidently an old sort and\r\nsome horticulturists believe it to be an old variety renamed. The\r\nvariety has been cultivated in Michigan orchards for many years under\r\nthe name Golden Drop given it by George W. Griffin, Casco, Allegan\r\nCounty, Michigan, who introduced it. The variety was at one time\r\nsupposed to be the peach which is grown in Michigan as Yellow Rareripe\r\nbut it is not the Yellow Rareripe cultivated today. The American\r\nPomological Society listed it in its fruit-catalog in 1909 under the\r\nname Gold Drop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD DROP]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, spreading, rather open-topped,\r\n    hardy, very productive; trunk thick and smooth; branches\r\n    stocky, smooth, reddish-brown with a covering of light\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets slender, with internodes dull pinkish-red\r\n    intermingled with green, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous,\r\n    raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and one-half inches long, one and one-fourth inches\r\n    wide, folded upward and recurved, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dark green, mottled; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with red along the\r\n    edge; petiole three-eighths inch long, with two to nine large,\r\n    reddish-brown or grayish, mixed glands usually on the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds long, conical or obtuse, plump, somewhat appressed,\r\n    pubescent; season of bloom early; flowers pale pink, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches across, well distributed; pedicels short,\r\n    medium to slender, glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green,\r\n    orange-colored within, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes broad,\r\n    usually acute, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals\r\n    ovate, notched near the base, tapering to long, narrow claws\r\n    variable in color at the base; filaments one-half inch long,\r\n    shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent at the ovary, equal\r\n    to or longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and seven-sixteenths inches long,\r\n    nearly two and one-half inches wide, roundish-oval, bulged\r\n    at one side, with unequal halves; cavity deep, abrupt,\r\n    twig-marked; suture very shallow, extending beyond the apex;\r\n    apex roundish, with a slightly mamelon or mucronate tip; color\r\n    greenish or golden-yellow, with a dull blush on one side;\r\n    pubescence thick, coarse; skin adhering to the pulp; flesh pale\r\n    yellow to the pit, variable in juiciness, pleasantly sprightly;\r\n    good in quality; stone free, one and nine-sixteenths inches\r\n    long, one and one-sixteenth inches wide, broadly ovate, bulged\r\n    at one side, with a pointed apex and deeply grooved surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture deeply grooved at the sides, rather narrow;\r\n    dorsal suture with a deep groove, wing-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR HOGG\r\n\r\n    =1.= Brown Bros. _Cat._ 27. 1906. =2.= _Ga.

In the Station orchard, Governor Hogg ripens a few days after\r\nCarman, is larger, handsomer and as good in quality. In both appearance\r\nand quality, Governor Hogg excels Greensboro, the size, shape and color\r\nof the two, as the illustrations show, being much the same though the\r\ncolor of this variety runs more to reds and soft tints of red. The\r\nflesh is firm, though tender and delicate, and the peaches ought to\r\nstand shipment well. As with all of these early, white-fleshed peaches,\r\nGovernor Hogg is quite susceptible to both leaf-curl and brown-rot.\r\n\r\nThe parentage of this peach is unknown. It seems to have originated\r\nwith a Mr. McClung, Tyler, Texas, about 1892, and was disseminated by\r\nMessrs. Sneed and Whitaker of the same place. The American Pomological\r\nSociety placed Governor Hogg on its fruit-list in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOVERNOR HOGG]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, upright-spreading, open-topped, hardy, variable\r\n    in productiveness; trunk thick, reddish-brown intermingled\r\n    with light ash-gray; branches slender, with short internodes,\r\n    brownish mingled with red and ash-gray, glossy, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with many conspicuous, large and small lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and one-half inches long, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward and slightly recurved, usually\r\n    oval-lanceolate, medium in thickness, leathery; upper surface\r\n    dark olive-green, smooth; lower surface grayish-green; margin\r\n    finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to five\r\n    reniform, reddish-brown glands of medium size, variable in\r\n    position; flower-buds conical, plump, pubescent, appressed;\r\n    blossoms open in mid-season.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; two and one-fourth inches long, more than\r\n    two inches wide, oblong-oval, compressed, oblique; cavity deep,\r\n    narrow, abrupt; suture shallow, becoming deeper at the cavity;\r\n    apex depressed, with a mucronate tip; color creamy-white,\r\n    blushed with red; pubescence short; skin thin, separates from\r\n    the pulp; flesh white, juicy, stringy, meaty, rather tough;\r\n    good in quality; stone clinging, one and three-eighths inches\r\n    long, seven-eighths inch wide, obovate, plump, strongly bulged\r\n    on one side, conspicuously winged, pointed at the base, with\r\n    the surfaces grooved and pitted; ventral suture winged, narrow,\r\n    with furrows of medium depth along the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENSBORO\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

It\r\ntakes high place because of its showy fruits and its large, vigorous,\r\nhealthy, early-bearing and prolific trees. In the last character,\r\nin particular, Greensboro is almost supreme--year in and year out,\r\nbarring accidents, its trees are fruitful. Possibly, too, no other\r\nwhite-fleshed peach is adapted to a greater variety of soils than\r\nGreensboro which, with fair capacity to stand heat and cold, makes\r\nit suitable for wide variations in peach-regions. The peaches, while\r\nhandsome, as the color-plate shows, are in no way remarkable, the\r\nquality, if anything, being rather inferior, so that it is the tree\r\nthat gives Greensboro its standing. The variety is well thought of by\r\nfruit-dealers not only on account of the attractive product but because\r\nthe fruits carry well and keep long. Possibly the peaches are less\r\nsusceptible to brown-rot than most other varieties of Greensboro's\r\nseason but to offset this advantage there are many cracked pits\r\nand accompanying mal-formed fruits. Picked green the stone clings;\r\npicked at maturity the variety may be called a freestone. All in all,\r\nGreensboro is one of the best early, market peaches for New York.\r\n\r\nGreensboro is a seedling of Connett grown by W. G. Balsey, Greensboro,\r\nNorth Carolina, about 1891. It was introduced by John A. Young of\r\nGreensboro as Balsey, this name being changed to Greensboro in 1894.\r\nGreensboro was added to the list of fruits recommended by the American\r\nPomological Society in 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREENSBORO]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, spreading, open-topped, hardy, very\r\n    productive; trunk thick, shaggy; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown covered with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    slender, long, with short internodes, dark red intermingled\r\n    with olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with very small,\r\n    conspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, recurved, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thick, leathery; upper surface dark green, smooth, rugose along\r\n    the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; margin finely serrate,\r\n    tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole one-half inch long,\r\n    with one to five reniform, reddish-brown glands usually at the\r\n    base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, large, medium to long, conical or obtuse,\r\n    very plump, strongly pubescent, usually free; season of bloom\r\n    early; flowers pale pink, one and three-fourths inches across,\r\n    usually in twos; pedicels very short, glabrous; calyx-tube dull\r\n    reddish-green, lemon-yellow within, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes very broad, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent\r\n    without; petals round-ovate, tapering to short, narrow claws\r\n    red at the base; filaments one-half inch long, shorter than the\r\n    petals; pistil pubescent at the base, equal to the stamens in\r\n    length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; two and one-half inches long, two and\r\n    three-eighths inches wide, oblong-oval, often oblique,\r\n    bulged at one side, compressed, with unequal sides; cavity\r\n    deep, narrow, abrupt; suture shallow, deepening toward the\r\n    cavity; apex roundish, with a small, mucronate tip; color\r\n    creamy-white, blushed red, with a few stripes of darker red\r\n    intermingling; pubescence heavy, nearly tomentose; skin rather\r\n    tough, separates from the pulp; flesh white, very juicy,\r\n    tender and melting, mild, sweet, sprightly; fair in quality;\r\n    stone semi-clinging, one and seven-sixteenths inches long, one\r\n    inch wide, winged on both sides, ovate, strongly bulged along\r\n    one side, with short grooves on the surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    narrow, deeply grooved along the sides; dorsal suture grooved,\r\n    winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALE EARLY\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mag.

Even now it has several\r\ncharacters to recommend it; as, large, vigorous, hardy, healthy,\r\nproductive trees, fruits handsome in color, uniform in size and shape,\r\nwith flesh more than ordinarily free from the stone for an early peach,\r\nfair quality for the season and extreme earliness. The chief fault is\r\nthat the peaches run small in size, scarcely exceeding large marbles,\r\nwhich they resemble in roundness. The variety must be grown in the\r\nbest of peach-lands, heavily thinned, and the trees severely pruned.\r\nThe peaches, besides being small, are very susceptible to brown-rot.\r\nNowhere very commonly planted, the variety is still widely distributed,\r\na fact, in view of the competition with many early peaches, which\r\nspeaks well for a peach introduced more than fifty years ago. It is\r\ninteresting to note that Hale Early was introduced into Europe many\r\nyears ago and that European pomologists still speak highly of it.\r\n\r\nHale Early grew from a seed planted in 1850 by a German named Moas at\r\nRandolph, Portage County, Ohio. A few years later the attention of a\r\nMr. Hale, Summit County, Ohio, was called to the seedling and he,\r\nimpressed with its earliness, began to propagate it. About 1859 the\r\nvariety was introduced by Hale and Jewett, nurserymen in Summit County,\r\nas Hale's Early German. In some localities it became known as Early\r\nGerman but finally the name Hale's Early was adopted. It was so listed\r\nin the American Pomological Society's fruit-catalog in 1862 but in 1891\r\nthe name was changed to Hale so to remain until 1909 when it appeared\r\nin the Society's catalog as Hale Early. The adoption of the last name\r\nis warranted, possibly, from the fact that another peach named Hale\r\nexisted several years before the origin of the present sort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALE EARLY]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, variable\r\n    in productiveness; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown mingled with ash-gray; branchlets long, dark\r\n    pinkish-red with a trace of olive-green, glossy, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with rather few large, conspicuous lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flat or curled downward, six and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, one and one-fourth inches wide, long-oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thin, leathery; upper surface dark green,\r\n    smooth; lower surface grayish-green; margin finely serrate,\r\n    often in two series, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to four small,\r\n    globose, reddish-brown glands usually at the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds conical or pointed, plump, pubescent, usually free;\r\n    blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers dark pink at the center,\r\n    with lighter pink toward the margin and with streaks of light\r\n    pink along the veins, one and one-half inches across, usually\r\n    single; pedicels short, glabrous, green, with a few reddish\r\n    dots; calyx-tube dull green mottled with red, with varying\r\n    shades of orange within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, usually obtuse, pubescent within and without, with\r\n    longer hairs along the edges, erect; petals round or inclined\r\n    to oval, entire, notched on both sides near the claws which\r\n    are short, broad and tinged with red near the base; filaments\r\n    one-half inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil finely\r\n    pubescent at the ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; one and three-fourths inches long, one\r\n    and seven-eighths inches wide, round, slightly compressed,\r\n    with unequal halves; cavity regular, medium to deep, wide,\r\n    flaring; suture shallow, with a slight bulge near the apex;\r\n    apex roundish or flattened, ending abruptly in a short, sharp,\r\n    recurved point; color creamy-white, with an attractive blush\r\n    extending over one-half of the surface; pubescence short,\r\n    thick; skin tough, free; flesh white, juicy, tender, sweet,\r\n    with some astringency; good in quality; stone semi-free, one\r\n    and five-sixteenths inches long, fifteen-sixteenths inch wide,\r\n    ovate or oval, plump, with a short-pointed apex, surfaces\r\n    marked by short grooves; ventral suture deep along the sides,\r\n    narrow; dorsal suture deeply grooved, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATH CLING\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

Its antiquity constitutes about its only claim\r\nto recognition though for its tree-characters and for at least one\r\nfruit-character it ought to be retained for breeding. Few varieties\r\nhave larger, healthier, hardier trees than Heath Cling, the fact that\r\nthe oldest of our peaches has from the first retained these characters\r\nin pristine vigor confuting the notion that varieties degenerate. In\r\nthe descriptions of Chinese peaches in Chapter 1, we read of winter\r\npeaches--sorts that could be kept for three or four months after\r\npicking. Of all American peaches, Heath Cling, possibly, most nearly\r\napproaches these Chinese winter peaches. It has been known to keep\r\nin good condition from October to December. Its quality, at best, is\r\ngood but often it runs poor. Well grown, the peach has a sweet, rich,\r\nvinous taste but the flesh adheres so tightly to the stone that it is\r\nnot pleasant eating out of hand though splendid cooked, preserved or\r\npickled, the stone in culinary operations imparting a pleasant flavor\r\nof peach-pit bitterness. It is the best of all peaches to preserve or\r\npickle whole. The color-plate shows the blushed sides of Heath Cling\r\nand therefore too much red for typical specimens of this variety.\r\n\r\nJust how old Heath Cling is no one knows but it probably was grown\r\nin the colonies before the Revolution. Two accounts are given of its\r\norigin. According to one it originated with Daniel Heath of Maryland\r\nfrom a pit brought from the Mediterranean. Another is that the honor of\r\noriginating this peach belongs in the Prince family and that the first\r\nWilliam Prince discovered the variety growing wild on the farm of Judge\r\nWillet, Flushing, New York. The Princes, according to this account,\r\ngave it the name Heath because it was found on a barren heath. It seems\r\nfairly well established that the variety was in the Prince orchards\r\nbefore the Revolutionary War whether or not it was found and named by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEATH CLING]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, unproductive;\r\n    trunk shaggy; branches stocky, reddish-brown covered with\r\n    light ash-gray; branchlets long, dark red intermingled\r\n    with olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, folded upward, recurving, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dark green, rugose; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, with two to seven small,\r\n    mostly reniform, reddish-brown glands usually at the base of\r\n    the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, medium to small, short, conical or pointed,\r\n    plump, pubescent, free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers\r\n    a faded pink, white at the center of the petals, about\r\n    three-fourths inch across; pedicels short, medium to thick,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green; calyx-lobes short,\r\n    broad, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals\r\n    roundish-oval, tapering to short, broad claws occasionally with\r\n    a red base; filaments one-fourth inch long, shorter than the\r\n    petals; pistil pubescent near the base, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; two and one-eighth inches long,\r\n    two and one-fourth inches wide, round-oval, compressed and\r\n    somewhat angular, with unequal sides; cavity variable in\r\n    depth and width, abrupt or flaring; suture shallow, extending\r\n    beyond the apex; apex ending in a swollen, pointed tip; color\r\n    creamy-white, blushed with red, splashed and mottled with\r\n    darker red; pubescence short, thick, fine; skin thin, adhering\r\n    to the pulp; flesh white, juicy, firm and meaty but tender,\r\n    sweet or somewhat sprightly; good in quality; stone clinging,\r\n    one and one-fourth inches long, seven-eighths inch wide, oval,\r\n    plump, flattened and pointed toward the base, tapering to a\r\n    short point at the apex, with dark brown, grooved surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture deep along the sides, thick, furrowed; dorsal\r\n    suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATH FREE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

We can see no\r\njustification of the Society's action in restoring the variety to its\r\nlist ten years later. The tree-characters of Heath Free seem to be,\r\nin the main, very good but the peaches are not at all attractive in\r\nappearance and none too good in quality--at best it is but a culinary\r\nsort. Possibly it is worth growing under some conditions as a late,\r\nwhite-fleshed peach.\r\n\r\nHeath Free is another old variety, a native of New England. Kenrick,\r\none of the first American pomologists, received the variety from\r\nGeneral Heath, Roxbury, Massachusetts, early in the Nineteenth Century.\r\nLater, Kenrick sent it to Prince at Flushing, New York, who is credited\r\nwith having distributed it. The variety should not be confused with\r\nHeath Cling. Ripening at the latter end of the peach-season, the term\r\n\"Late\" is often attached to the name. In 1862 the American Pomological\r\nSociety put this peach on its fruit-list under the name Kenrick\r\nHeath but dropped it from the list in 1899. Ten years later, 1909, the\r\nvariety was replaced in the Society's catalog as Heath Free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEATH FREE]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    unproductive; trunk thick, somewhat shaggy; branches stocky,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown covered with very light ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets long, with many short, spur-like branches near the\r\n    tips, with internodes dark red intermingled with olive-green,\r\n    glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous conspicuous lenticels,\r\n    raised near the base and tip.\r\n\r\n    Leaves seven and one-eighth inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward, recurved slightly, long-oval\r\n    to obovate-lanceolate, rather thin; upper surface dark\r\n    green, smooth becoming rugose near the midrib; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, with two to five reniform,\r\n    reddish-brown glands usually on the petiole.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds half-hardy, conical or pointed, very pubescent,\r\n    free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers dark pink along\r\n    the margins of the petals changing to white toward their\r\n    centers, well distributed; pedicels short, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green, yellow within, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes short, narrow, acute to obtuse, glabrous within,\r\n    pubescent without; petals small, narrow-oval, often broadly\r\n    notched near the base, tapering to short, broad claws red at\r\n    the base; filaments one-fourth inch long, equal to the petals\r\n    in length; pistil pubescent at the base, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in late mid-season; two and one-eighth inches\r\n    long, two and one-fourth inches thick, roundish-oval to\r\n    oblong-oval, often strongly compressed, with halves nearly\r\n    equal; cavity medium to shallow, wide, flaring, contracted\r\n    along the sides, with tender skin; suture shallow; apex\r\n    roundish, with a depressed, mucronate tip; color creamy-white,\r\n    blushed or mottled with red, with splashes of deeper red;\r\n    pubescence rather coarse, thick; skin thick, tough, adherent\r\n    to the pulp; flesh white, bronzed at the pit, juicy, coarse,\r\n    firm but tender, mild subacid with some astringency; good in\r\n    quality; stone free, one and three-eighths inches long, one\r\n    inch wide, flattened near the base, oval, with long grooves\r\n    deeply sunken in the surfaces; ventral suture deeply furrowed\r\n    along the edges, wide; dorsal suture grooved, faintly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILEY\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

It is the earliest commercial freestone,\r\nwhite-fleshed peach and it is rather better in quality than most of its\r\ncompetitors. Well grown, the peaches are large in size and handsomely\r\ncolored but the fruits are not quite as uniform in either size or\r\ncolor as could be desired for a commercial variety. The trees, while\r\nproductive, are neither large nor sufficiently hardy and vigorous to\r\nmake an ideal commercial sort. Still, we must end as we began, with the\r\nstatement that there is a place for Hiley because of earliness and high\r\nquality. The fruits, unfortunately, are easy prey to brown-rot.\r\n\r\nHiley originated with Eugene Hiley, Marshallville, Georgia, about\r\n1886. Seeds of several varieties, including Belle and Elberta, were\r\nplanted and from these sprang one tree which bore the fruit under\r\ndiscussion. R. A. Hiley, who seems to have first discovered its value,\r\nis of the opinion that this variety is a seedling of Belle crossed\r\nwith Alexander. The new peach was first named Early Belle and the\r\nfirst crops were shipped under this name. Later the name was changed\r\nto Hiley. The American Pomological Society placed the variety on its\r\nfruit-list in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HILEY]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, lacking in vigor, upright-spreading,\r\n    open-topped, very productive; trunk thick; branches stocky,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown covered with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    with short internodes, brownish-red heavily overlaid with\r\n    olive-green, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous lenticels\r\n    variable in number and size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, folded upwards to nearly flattened, narrow-oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dull, dark green,\r\n    mottled, nearly smooth; lower surface grayish-green; margin\r\n    finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to eight small,\r\n    globose and reniform, greenish-yellow glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, obtuse, plump, heavily pubescent, appressed\r\n    or nearly so; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers pink,\r\n    one and seven-eighths inches across, often in twos; pedicels\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube dull, dark reddish-green,\r\n    greenish-yellow within, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes broad,\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals\r\n    roundish-ovate, tapering to long, broad claws red at the base;\r\n    filaments one-half inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the ovary, equal to or often longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and three-eighths inches\r\n    long, two and one-fourth inches thick, roundish-conic to\r\n    oblong-conic, bulged near the apex, with unequal halves; cavity\r\n    abrupt, the skin tender and tearing easily; suture shallow,\r\n    deepening toward the apex; apex pointed; color greenish-yellow\r\n    with a dull blush often extending over one-half the surface,\r\n    more or less mottled; pubescence thick, fine, short; skin\r\n    thin, tough, separates from the pulp when fully ripe; flesh\r\n    creamy-white, stained red at the pit, stringy, firm but tender,\r\n    with a distinct, pleasant flavor, sprightly; good in quality;\r\n    stone semi-free to free, one and three-eighths inches long,\r\n    seven-eighths inch wide, elliptical to ovate, pointed at both\r\n    ends, with nearly smooth surfaces; ventral suture rather wide\r\n    and with deep furrows along the sides; dorsal suture a small\r\n    groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYNES\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Tex.

Rpt._ 42. 1895.\r\n\r\nComing at a season when there are several very good, white-fleshed\r\npeaches, we doubt whether Hynes can establish itself in the peach-list\r\nfor New York. The peaches are not quite large enough and the stone\r\nclings a little too tenaciously for a first-class early peach. The\r\nflavor is good for an early peach and when large enough the fruits are\r\nattractive, shape and coloring being particularly pleasing. Hynes was\r\nat one time highly recommended, widely advertised and largely sold in\r\nNew York by nurserymen and fruit-growers in this State. We doubt if\r\nmany are now planting it. The color-plate is an excellent reproduction\r\nof the variety.\r\n\r\nHynes was grown about 1877 by E. F. Hynes, West Plains, Missouri.\r\nIts parentage is unknown. The variety soon became disseminated as\r\na valuable early, commercial peach. At first it was known as Hynes\r\nSurprise but gradually the name has been shortened to Hynes. The late\r\nS. D. Willard, Geneva, New York, grew and recommended this variety\r\nfor a number of years and by some has been given the credit of having\r\noriginated and introduced it. The American Pomological Society put\r\nHynes on its fruit-list in 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYNES]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, hardy,\r\n    medium in productiveness; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown with a small amount of ash-gray; branchlets long,\r\n    with internodes of medium length, dark red intermingled with\r\n    olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous, large\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, about one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, oval to obovate-lanceolate, leathery, dull, dark\r\n    green, smooth; lower surface grayish-green; apex tapering\r\n    to a long, narrow point; margin finely serrate, tipped with\r\n    reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with\r\n    one to five small, globose, brownish-yellow glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, small, short, obtuse, plump, slightly\r\n    pubescent, usually appressed; blossoms appear in mid-season;\r\n    flowers dark pink at the center, light pink near the edges,\r\n    often in twos; pedicels short, medium to thick, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube reddish-green, greenish-yellow within,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, medium to broad,\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals broadly\r\n    oval, irregular in outline, tapering to claws often red at the\r\n    base; filaments one-half inch long, shorter than the petals;\r\n    pistil pubescent near the base, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; two and one-half inches long, two and\r\n    one-fourth inches wide, round-oblate, with halves usually\r\n    equal; cavity wide, flaring; suture shallow, becoming deeper\r\n    near the tip; apex flattened or roundish, ending abruptly in\r\n    a short, sharp point; color greenish or creamy-white, with\r\n    a dull, dark red blush, splashed and mottled with carmine;\r\n    pubescence thin, short, fine; skin thin, tender, variable in\r\n    adherence to the pulp; flesh greenish-white, with a red stain\r\n    under the skin and often rayed with red about the pit, juicy,\r\n    stringy, tender and melting, sweet, mild; fair to good in\r\n    quality; stone nearly free, one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    seven-eighths inch wide, bulged on one side, ovate, very plump,\r\n    with surfaces pitted and with short, narrow grooves; ventral\r\n    suture furrowed, very deeply grooved at the edges; dorsal\r\n    suture wide, deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLINOIS\r\n\r\n    =1.= _N.

It has been little tried in New York and growers in\r\nother peach-regions are not in accord as to its value. In size, color\r\nand shape of fruit, as the color-plate shows, Illinois is one of the\r\nbeauties of the orchard. Yet, all things considered, the new variety is\r\nnot as good as Champion with which it would have to compete. Neither\r\ntree- nor fruit-characters are quite satisfactory as the variety grows\r\non the Station grounds. It must be apparent, too, to all peach-growers\r\nthat the industry is overloaded with white-fleshed peaches which at\r\nbest must be sold in nearby markets or grown for home use.\r\n\r\nIllinois originated about 1910 on the grounds of E. H. Riehl near North\r\nAlton, Illinois. It is supposed to be a cross between Stark Heath and\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLINOIS]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size and vigor, upright to spreading, hardy,\r\n    very productive; trunk thick; branches stocky, smooth, dark\r\n    reddish-brown overlaid by ash-gray; branchlets slender, short,\r\n    with internodes dark red and olive-green, smooth, glabrous,\r\n    with a few inconspicuous, raised lenticels variable in size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and one-half inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, curled under at the tips, ovate-lanceolate, thin,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dull, dark green, rugose along the\r\n    midrib; lower surface olive-green; margin deeply and sharply\r\n    serrate, the serrations often in two series, tipped with small\r\n    glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, glandless.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds medium to large, obtuse or conical, plump,\r\n    pubescent, appressed; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers\r\n    variable in color, over one inch across, often in twos;\r\n    pedicels short, greenish, glabrous; calyx-tube reddish-green,\r\n    greenish-yellow within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    medium to broad, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent without;\r\n    petals oval, crenate, often broadly notched near the base,\r\n    tapering to narrow claws with a tinge of red at the base;\r\n    filaments one-half inch long, equal to the petals in length;\r\n    pistil pubescent at the base, as long as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, two and one-half inches wide, round-oblate, compressed,\r\n    the halves usually unequal; cavity deep, abrupt, often tinged\r\n    with red; suture shallow, deepening toward the apex; apex\r\n    roundish, with a mucronate tip; color creamy-white, blushed\r\n    with dull, dark red and mottled with splashes of brighter red;\r\n    pubescence heavy; skin tough; flesh white, stained red near\r\n    the pit, juicy, tender and melting, sweet; good in quality;\r\n    stone semi-free to free, one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    fifteen-sixteenths inch wide, oval or obovate, not bulged,\r\n    slightly elongated toward the base, plump, short-pointed at the\r\n    apex, with grooved and pitted surfaces; ventral suture winged,\r\n    of medium width, deeply grooved along the edges; dorsal suture\r\n    deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL\r\n\r\n    =1.= _La.

The fruit is not easily distinguished\r\nin appearance from that of Climax, at least by those unfamiliar with\r\nsouthern peaches, and is also rather closely allied to Honey in outward\r\ncharacter but has a somewhat distinct flavor in which it surpasses\r\nClimax and Honey. It differs from both, too, in time of ripening. The\r\npeaches of this, as of other honey-flavored sorts, drop badly as they\r\nmature. It is doubtful if we shall ever grow pure-bred peaches of the\r\nHoney type in New York for the markets, but Imperial, at least, is\r\nworth a place in every home orchard where it does not have to brave too\r\ngreat a degree of cold; and peach-breeders should seize the opportunity\r\nto cross it with our less richly flavored northern varieties.\r\n\r\nImperial is a seedling of Honey grown in 1890 by G. L. Taber, Glen\r\nSaint Mary, Florida. This variety has been much confused with White\r\nImperial, a sort grown in New York many years ago but long since out of\r\ncultivation. Pomologists frequently list White Imperial as a synonym\r\nof Imperial, giving the origin as New York, when the variety in mind\r\nis the true Imperial of southern origin. Imperial was listed in the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society's catalog in 1897 but was dropped in 1899.\r\nIt appears again, however, in the Society's catalog in 1909 under the\r\nname Imperial with White Imperial incorrectly given as a synonym.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPERIAL]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size or small, upright-spreading, round-topped,\r\n    productive; trunk thick, rough; branches stocky, roughened,\r\n    reddish-brown intermingled more or less with ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets slender, often rebranching, long, with internodes\r\n    dark pinkish-red mingled with varying shades of olive-green,\r\n    and with conspicuous, numerous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, flattened, lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dull, dark\r\n    green; lower surface olive-green; margin finely and shallowly\r\n    serrate, tipped with glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    with one to four small, reniform glands usually at the base of\r\n    the blade.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small, medium to short, conical or obtuse,\r\n    pubescent, plump, usually appressed; blossoms appear in\r\n    mid-season; flowers medium in size, showy, light pink, usually\r\n    single; pedicels medium in length and thickness, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-green within, obconic;\r\n    calyx-lobes acute or obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent\r\n    without; petals roundish, tapering to claws tinged with red at\r\n    the base; filaments equal to or shorter than the petals; pistil\r\n    pubescent.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and one-half inches long, two and\r\n    three-sixteenths inches wide, oval, with unequal halves; cavity\r\n    shallow, medium in width, flaring; suture very shallow, often\r\n    indistinct toward the cavity; apex distinctly elongated; color\r\n    pale green becoming whitish, with faint mottlings and with a\r\n    distinct or faint blush; pubescence short, thick; skin tough,\r\n    adhering to the pulp; flesh white, stained with red near the\r\n    pit, juicy, fine-grained, tender and melting, very sweet and\r\n    of a delightful flavor; very good to best; stone free, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches long, thirteen-sixteenths inch wide, oval\r\n    or ovate, not very plump, bulged at one side, long and pointed\r\n    at the apex, with roughish and pitted surfaces, dark brown\r\n    mingled with purplish-red; ventral suture rather narrow, often\r\n    winged, deeply grooved along the edges; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

The introducer and many growers claim extreme\r\nhardiness of wood and bud for the variety--others say that it is\r\nsurpassed by Crosby, Wager and other varieties of their type. The\r\ntrees on the Station grounds turned out not to be true to name so\r\nthat we can offer no data as to hardiness. Iron Mountain is a very\r\nlate, white-fleshed, freestone peach well adapted for extending the\r\ncommercial limits for this fruit in regions where fall frosts hold\r\noff sufficiently long for the fruit to ripen. The tree-characters are\r\nreported by most growers as very satisfactory and the peaches serve\r\nvery well for culinary purposes but are not sufficiently attractive\r\nfor a dessert fruit though the quality is excellent. There seem to be\r\ntwo varieties, much alike in fruit, passing under this name; one is\r\nlarge-flowered, the other small-flowered. This variety might well be\r\nplanted in New York for some markets; as, for example, near towns and\r\ncities where it is desirable to extend the local market as late as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIron Mountain seems to have originated in New Jersey about a\r\nquarter-century ago but nothing is known of its parentage or by whom\r\ngrown. The variety was introduced by J. H. Lindley, Whitehouse, New\r\nJersey. It was put on the fruit-list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRON MOUNTAIN]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, not\r\n    always productive; trunk thick; branches smooth, dark ash-gray\r\n    mingled with reddish-brown; branchlets medium to slender, with\r\n    internodes of medium length, greenish-brown, smooth, glabrous,\r\n    with numerous small, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and one-half inches wide, folded\r\n    upward and recurved, oval to obovate-lanceolate, medium in\r\n    thickness, leathery; upper surface dark green, smooth; lower\r\n    surface light green, with a prominent midrib; margin glandular,\r\n    finely serrate; petiole three-eighths inch long, with one to\r\n    six reniform glands of medium size, usually on the petiole;\r\n    flower-buds medium to small, conical, free; season of bloom\r\n    late; flowers small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; two and three-fourths inches long,\r\n    two and five-eighths inches thick, oblong-oval, often bulged\r\n    on one side, compressed; cavity contracted, below medium in\r\n    depth, flaring; suture shallow, extending only to the tip;\r\n    apex distinctly mucronate or roundish, sometimes tapering;\r\n    color pale greenish or creamy-white, occasionally with a\r\n    light blush; pubescence heavy; skin medium to thin, tender,\r\n    adherent to the pulp; flesh white, stained brown next to the\r\n    pit, juicy, tender, sweet, mild; quality good; stone semi-free\r\n    one and five-eighths inches long, more than one inch wide,\r\n    somewhat wedge-like at the base, obovate, plump, long-pointed\r\n    at the apex, winged, with large, wide and deep grooves in the\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture with wide, deep furrows; dorsal suture\r\n    grooved deeply, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. H. HALE\r\n\r\n    =1.= W. P. Stark _Cat._ 45-55. 1913. =2.= Waugh _Am. Peach\r\n    Orch._ 203. 1913.\r\n\r\nOf many new peaches, J. H. Hale is now the leading aspirant for\r\npomological honors. Indeed, it is one of the sensations of the\r\npomological world, the variety having many merits to commend it and the\r\nname and fame of the originator and of the introducers, together with\r\nextensive advertising, helping much to bring the peach to the attention\r\nof fruit-growers. Elberta is now the standard commercial peach and,\r\nsince J. H. Hale must make its way in competition with the variety in\r\ncommand of the markets, we can best set forth the characters of the\r\nnew sort by comparing it with Elberta with which all are familiar. The\r\ncomparison is easy to make, for the two peaches are of the same general\r\ntype, Elberta, probably, being one of the parents of J. H. Hale.\r\n\r\nIn size of fruit, J. H. Hale averages larger--all things considered a\r\ntrifle too large when the trees are at their best. The flesh of J. H.\r\nHale is firmer and heavier and the peaches will ship and keep longer\r\nthan those of Elberta. In shape, the fruit is almost a perfect sphere,\r\nits symmetry being scarcely marred by the suture so that it is more\r\nshapely than the oblong Elberta and can, of course, be packed to better\r\nadvantage. The color-plates of the two peaches show the differences in\r\nshape very well. In color of fruit there is no choice--both peaches\r\nare voluptuously handsome. The skin of J. H. Hale is less pubescent\r\nand possibly a little firmer and tighter, characters adding to the\r\nappearance and shipping qualities of the fruit. It is but an invitation\r\nto argument to say which is the better in the characters that go to\r\nplease the palate--flavor, aroma, texture and juiciness. Neither, in\r\ncomparison with many other peaches, can be rated as extra good.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we cannot be as certain of the merits of the trees of the\r\ntwo varieties as we are of the fruits. This much we know, J. H. Hale\r\nis a few days earlier than Elberta and its trees and buds are hardier\r\nthan those of Elberta. Which is the more productive is not certain and\r\nthis can be ascertained only when data can be had from a large number\r\nof growers since productiveness in both is bound to vary with the\r\nsoil. The greatest asset of Elberta is its ability to adapt itself to\r\ndiverse soils; whether J. H. Hale is equally elastic in constitution\r\nremains to be seen. The variety is still on probation in New York with\r\nthe chances growing stronger each year that it will take high place\r\namong commercial peaches. We do not expect it to drive Elberta from\r\nthe markets but the markets will be shared between the two, J. H. Hale\r\nreaching the fruit-stands several days in advance of Elberta. Would\r\nthat there were as good a commercial variety to follow Elberta.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable variety is a chance seedling found by J. H. Hale, South\r\nGlastonbury, Connecticut. From its characters, one sees at once that it\r\nis either an offspring or is very closely related to Elberta--at first\r\nmany thought the two were identical. After having thoroughly tested the\r\nnew variety in commercial orchards in both Connecticut and Georgia, Mr.\r\nHale decided that it was worth introducing and sold the new peach to\r\nthe William P. Stark Nurseries, Stark City, Missouri. The distribution\r\nof the variety was begun in 1912 and possibly no other tree-fruit has\r\never been so rapidly propagated and so widely distributed as has the J.\r\nH. Hale in the past four years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. H.

It is enough to say that it is very similar to Early\r\nCrawford--best of all early peaches--and on the Station grounds is more\r\nproductive, unproductiveness being the fault that keeps Early Crawford\r\nfrom being a money-making variety. Whether or not Jennie Worthen can be\r\ngrown commercially, it is well worth planting in the home orchard.\r\n\r\nBut little is known of the history of this variety. According to a\r\nletter from the late T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas, it originated in\r\nIllinois with a Mr. Worthen and was named for his daughter.

The fruit is better in quality than\r\nElberta but not as showy in appearance and the trees are not quite as\r\nproductive. Kalamazoo ripens with Late Crawford and could well compete\r\nwith that variety for the trees are hardier in wood and bud and are\r\nmuch more productive. The variety falls short, however, in the size\r\nof the peaches, these running no larger than a medium Late Crawford,\r\nthough possibly this defect could be remedied by thinning. The fruits\r\nare of highest quality either for dessert or culinary purposes. The\r\ntrees are susceptible to leaf-curl and must be thoroughly sprayed for\r\nthis fungus. The variety is grown rather extensively in Michigan and is\r\nwell known in parts of New York.\r\n\r\nKalamazoo originated with J. N. Stearns, Kalamazoo, Michigan, about\r\n1869, as a sprout from below the bud on a Yellow Alberge tree. It first\r\nfruited in 1871 and was exhibited that year at the Michigan State Fair\r\nwhere it received a premium as the best seedling peach. The American\r\nPomological Society placed Kalamazoo in its fruit-list in 1899 where it\r\nstill remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KALAMAZOO]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, spreading, vigorous, open-topped, very productive;\r\n    trunk medium in thickness and smoothness; branches stocky,\r\n    nearly smooth, reddish-brown mingled with light ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets long, with internodes of medium length, dark\r\n    pinkish-red with a small amount of olive-green, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with lenticels of medium number and size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, one and three-eighths\r\n    inches wide, nearly flat or curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dark olive-green,\r\n    smooth; lower surface grayish-green; apex narrow-acuminate;\r\n    margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands;\r\n    petiole three-eighths inch long, with one to six small,\r\n    reniform, reddish-brown glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, conical, somewhat pointed, pubescent, partly\r\n    appressed; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers pale pink,\r\n    white at the center of the petals, one and one-eighth inches\r\n    across; pedicels short, medium to slender, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-colored within, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes medium to narrow, acute, glabrous within,\r\n    pubescent without; petals oval to somewhat ovate, irregular in\r\n    outline near the base, tapering to narrow claws occasionally\r\n    reddish at the base; filaments one-half inch long; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the base, equal to or shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and three-eighths inches long, two and\r\n    seven-sixteenths inches wide, roundish-oval, often compressed,\r\n    with unequal sides; cavity rather wide, flaring to abrupt;\r\n    suture indistinct becoming more pronounced toward the tip;\r\n    apex ending in a small, elongated point; color greenish-yellow\r\n    becoming yellow, with a faint or distinct blush usually\r\n    extending over one-fourth of the surface, mottled; pubescence\r\n    thick, fine; skin thin, tough, separates from the pulp; flesh\r\n    light yellow, stained with red near the pit, juicy, tender,\r\n    sweet, mild; good in quality; stone free or nearly so, one\r\n    and one-half inches long, one and one-sixteenths inches wide,\r\n    oval to ovate, bulged on one side, winged near the base, the\r\n    surfaces pitted and grooved near the apex; ventral suture very\r\n    deeply grooved at the sides, medium in width; dorsal suture\r\n    winged, grooved deeply.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMONT\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cornell Sta.

It is a\r\nyellow-fleshed, freestone peach, much like Early Crawford in appearance\r\nand quality, which ripens from one to two weeks after Elberta. It is\r\nmore productive than either of the Crawfords and if it does as well\r\nelsewhere as about Geneva, the place of its origin, it ought to take\r\nhigh place in the list of commercial peaches for this State. Several\r\nlarge growers in this region speak well of it as a market fruit. As a\r\ngarden variety for its season, it can hardly be surpassed.\r\n\r\nThe original Lamont tree grew as a chance seedling on the grounds\r\nof Charles Lamont, Geneva, New York, first fruiting about 1884. It\r\nwas introduced by E. Smith and Sons, Geneva, New York, soon after its\r\ndiscovery. The variety is offered by several Geneva nurserymen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMONT]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, productive; trunk\r\n    thick, nearly smooth; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    with light ash-gray; branchlets with internodes of medium\r\n    length, dark pinkish-red intermingled with green, glossy,\r\n    smooth, glabrous, with inconspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves seven inches long, one and five-eighths inches\r\n    wide, folded upward and curled downward slightly, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thick, leathery; upper surface dark\r\n    olive-green, smooth; lower surface grayish-green; apex\r\n    acuminate; margin finely and sharply serrate, tipped with\r\n    reddish-brown glands; petiole one-half inch long, with one to\r\n    six reniform, dark brown glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, large, long, conical or pointed,\r\n    pubescent, free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers\r\n    thirteen-sixteenths inch across, white at the center of the\r\n    petals becoming dark pink near the edges; pedicels short,\r\n    green; calyx-tube reddish-green at the base, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes short, medium to broad, obtuse, glabrous within,\r\n    heavily pubescent without; petals roundish-oval, somewhat\r\n    irregular in outline near the base, tapering to long, narrow\r\n    claws occasionally with a red base; filaments three-eighths\r\n    inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil pubescent near\r\n    the base, as long as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; about two and seven-eighths inches in\r\n    diameter, roundish-cordate, compressed, with unequal sides;\r\n    cavity deep, usually abrupt; suture indistinct, becoming\r\n    deeper near the tip; apex roundish or pointed, usually with\r\n    a noticeable mamelon or sometimes mucronate tip; color\r\n    golden-yellow, blushed and faintly striped and splashed with\r\n    carmine; pubescence heavy, long, coarse; skin thick, tough,\r\n    adherent to the pulp; flesh light yellow, stained with red near\r\n    the pit, juicy, coarse, tender, pleasantly sprightly; good in\r\n    quality; stone free, one and five-eighths inches long, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, oval to obovate, flattened near the\r\n    base, often bulged at the apex, winged, with grooved surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture deeply marked along the edges, narrow, winged;\r\n    dorsal suture grooved, the sides wing-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE YORK\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

It is one of\r\nthe old American sorts and has been much confounded with several other\r\npeaches. We place it among the major varieties in _The Peaches of New\r\nYork_ chiefly to straighten out the nomenclatorial tangle involving\r\nit and the several varieties with which it is commonly confounded.\r\n\r\nLarge York has been more often confused with Early York than any other\r\nsort. George IV, Haines and Honest John have also been listed time\r\nand again as identical with Large York. While the sorts mentioned\r\nhave many resemblances, there are distinguishing characters for all\r\nof them. Large York, known also as Large Early York and Large Early\r\nRareripe, originated with William Prince,[261] Flushing, New York, some\r\ntime in the Eighteenth Century, probably from a pit of Red Rareripe.\r\nThe variety was at first called Early York but to distinguish it from\r\nanother Early York the term Large was added. Prince sent the variety\r\nto William Forsyth of England about 1790. Forsyth grew it in the Royal\r\nKensington Gardens and later renamed it Royal Kensington under which\r\nname it is frequently sold in England. While Large York and Early York\r\nare closely related, the leaves of the latter are glandless while\r\nthose of the former have globose glands. At the National Convention\r\nof Fruit-Growers held in 1848, Large York was put on the list of\r\nrecommended varieties under the name Large Early York. The peach has\r\nremained on the American Pomological Society's fruit-catalog since the\r\ndate given, the name being shortened in 1897 to Large York.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    rather unproductive; trunk thick; branches thick, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown intermingled with light ash-gray; branchlets with\r\n    long internodes, dark red with some green, somewhat russetted,\r\n    glossy, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous, numerous, large,\r\n    raised lenticels; leaves six and one-half inches long, one\r\n    and one-half inches wide, variable in position, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thick, leathery, dark green tinged with\r\n    olive-green; margin finely serrate; petiole three-eighths\r\n    inch long, glandless or with one to six small, globose,\r\n    reddish-brown glands; flower-buds small, short, pointed, not\r\n    very plump, pubescent, appressed; flowers small, appearing in\r\n    mid-season.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens in mid-season; one and seven-eighths inches long,\r\n    two and one-sixteenth inches wide, round-oblate, bulged at\r\n    one side, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity narrow,\r\n    abrupt, faintly splashed with red; suture shallow, becoming\r\n    deeper toward the apex and extending considerably beyond;\r\n    apex roundish or depressed, with a mucronate tip; color\r\n    greenish-white or creamy-white, blushed and mottled with red;\r\n    pubescence short, thick, fine; skin thin, tender, adheres to\r\n    the pulp; flesh white, rayed with red near the pit, juicy,\r\n    stringy, tender, sweet, mild, pleasant flavored, aromatic; good\r\n    in quality; stone nearly free, one and one-eighth inches long,\r\n    seven-eighths inch wide, oval, plump, short-pointed at the\r\n    apex; ventral suture medium in width; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE CRAWFORD\r\n\r\n    =1.= Mas _Le Verger_ =7=:231, 232, fig. 114. 1866-73. =2.=\r\n    Waugh _Am.

Late Crawford, a\r\nquarter-century ago, began to give way to Elberta because of the\r\ngreater productiveness of the Elberta tree and the showier Elberta\r\nfruits and now, though widely distributed, is nowhere largely planted\r\nand seems destined to pass out of cultivation as a peach of commerce.\r\nUnproductiveness and tardiness in coming in bearing are the faults\r\non account of which Late Crawford is failing. Itself adapted to a\r\nwide range of soil and climatic condition, Late Crawford, through the\r\nrecurring variations from seed, has made the Crawford family the most\r\ncosmopolitan of the several distinct races of American peaches. Of all\r\nthe family it is most virile, more than a score of its offspring being\r\ndescribed in _The Peaches of New York_.\r\n\r\nCompared with other Crawford-like peaches, Late Crawford is possibly\r\nthe best in fruit-characters, the peaches being unsurpassed in\r\nappearance and scarcely equalled in texture of flesh and richness of\r\nflavor. The peaches, too, are more shapely and more uniform in shape\r\nthan fruits of other Crawford varieties, being rounder, trimmer in\r\ncontour and having a suture that scarcely mars the symmetry of the\r\npeach. In color, Late Crawford runs the whole gamut of soft tints of\r\nred and yellow that make Melocotons and Crawfords the most beautiful of\r\nall peaches. The trees are as vigorous, hardy, healthy and as little\r\nsusceptible to disease as any of the varieties near of kin, failing\r\nonly, as has been said, in productiveness and in coming in bearing\r\nrather tardily. Evidently destined to pass from commercial cultivation,\r\nLate Crawford ought long to remain one of the treasures of the home\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nLate Crawford was raised by William Crawford, Middletown, New Jersey,\r\nat least a hundred years ago, the exact date of origin, as well as\r\nits parentage, being unknown. The variety was first brought to notice\r\nby William Kenrick, Newton, Massachusetts, who described it in the\r\n_American Orchardist_ under the name Crawford's Superb Malacatune.\r\nNo doubt it has a worthy line of ancestors in the old seedling\r\norchards of the early colonists, the fact that it is the founder of\r\na race indicating long-continued reproduction from seeds with little\r\ninterposition of budding. At the National Convention of Fruit-Growers\r\nheld in 1848, Late Crawford was placed in the list of recommended\r\nfruits and since that time has held a place on the fruit-list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society. It was first listed as Crawford's Late;\r\nlater as Crawford's Late Melocoton and now appears as Late Crawford in\r\naccordance with the Society's rules of nomenclature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATE CRAWFORD]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, not very\r\n    productive; trunk stocky, smooth; branches thick, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown mingled with light ash-gray; branchlets long,\r\n    somewhat twiggy, dark reddish-brown overlaid with olive-green,\r\n    smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous, numerous, small, raised\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and seven-eighths inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward and curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thick, leathery; upper surface dark\r\n    olive-green, smooth becoming rugose along the midrib; lower\r\n    surface grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with\r\n    reddish-brown glands; petiole one-half inch long, with one to\r\n    six small, globose, reddish-brown glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, large, above medium in length, obtuse or\r\n    conical, plump, very pubescent, appressed or free; blossoms\r\n    open in mid-season; flowers one and one-eighth inches across,\r\n    pink, well distributed; pedicels short, medium to slender,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-colored\r\n    within, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes medium to broad,\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent without, becoming heavily\r\n    pubescent near the edges; petals oval to ovate, notched at the\r\n    base, tapering to narrow claws which are reddish at the base;\r\n    filaments seven-sixteenths inch long, shorter than the petals;\r\n    pistil pubescent near the base, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and three-fourths inches long, two\r\n    and eleven-sixteenths inches wide, roundish-oval, compressed,\r\n    with unequal halves; cavity deep, medium to narrow, abrupt\r\n    or flaring; suture shallow, deepening toward the apex; apex\r\n    roundish, with a slightly pointed and swollen beak-like tip;\r\n    color deep yellow, dully or brightly blushed, with the red\r\n    cheek splashed with darker red; pubescence short, fine; skin\r\n    thick, tough, separates readily from the pulp; flesh yellow,\r\n    strongly stained with red at the pit, juicy, firm but tender,\r\n    sweet but sprightly, richly flavored; very good in quality;\r\n    stone free, one and three-fourths inches long, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, ovate, flattened, bulged on one side,\r\n    blunt-pointed, flattened near the base, with surfaces deeply\r\n    pitted and grooved; ventral suture deeply grooved along the\r\n    edges; dorsal suture a deep, wide groove, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE RARERIPE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

It is of value now\r\nonly because of its historical interest though its high quality makes\r\nit well worth growing in gardens. Its position as a milestone in the\r\nprogress of peaches is better marked if we quote A. J. Downing[262]\r\nwho wrote in 1845 when Late Rareripe was in its prime and one of\r\nthe leading varieties: \"Unquestionably one of the very finest of\r\nall peaches. Its large size, great excellence, late maturity,\r\nproductiveness, vigor, all unite to recommend it to universal favor. We\r\ncannot praise it too highly.\"\r\n\r\nThis old variety is certainly of American origin but the originator,\r\nthe time and place of origin are all unknown. It has been cultivated\r\nmore than a hundred years. Prince believed it to be a seedling of Red\r\nRareripe but there is nothing to be found now to verify this belief.\r\nLate Rareripe was sent to France in 1855 where it has since been grown\r\nas a satisfactory commercial sort. The American Pomological Society\r\nlisted this variety in its catalog in 1862 under the name Late Red\r\nRareripe. In 1897, the name was shortened to Late Rareripe as it now\r\nappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATE RARERIPE]\r\n\r\n    Tree often very large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, of\r\n    medium productiveness; trunk stocky, nearly smooth; branches\r\n    thick, smooth, reddish-brown tinged with light ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets long, with internodes of medium length, dark\r\n    pinkish-red intermingled with dull green, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous conspicuous, large lenticels raised at the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, folded upward and curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thick, leathery; upper surface smooth\r\n    becoming rugose at the midrib; lower surface pale green; apex\r\n    acuminate; margin finely and often doubly serrate, tipped\r\n    with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    glandless or with one to four small, globose, reddish-brown\r\n    glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds half-hardy, conical to pointed, plump, pubescent,\r\n    free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers one and\r\n    three-sixteenths inches across, white at the center of the\r\n    petals changing to pink toward the margins, well distributed;\r\n    pedicels short, glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green\r\n    at the base, greenish-yellow within, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes acute, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals\r\n    oval, faintly notched near the base, tapering to narrow claws\r\n    of medium length tinged with red at the base; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil\r\n    pubescent near the base, usually as long as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and five-eighths inches long, two\r\n    and eleven-sixteenths inches wide, roundish-cordate, with\r\n    unequal surfaces; cavity variable in depth and width, abrupt\r\n    or flaring, often with twig-mark across the cavity; suture\r\n    variable in depth, extending beyond the tip; apex roundish,\r\n    mamelon or mucronate, recurved; color greenish or creamy-white,\r\n    sometimes with a lively red blush, mottled and splashed with\r\n    darker and duller red; pubescence thick, coarse; skin tough,\r\n    adherent to the pulp; flesh white, stained with red near the\r\n    pit, juicy, stringy, tender, pleasantly flavored, sweet or\r\n    somewhat sprightly; good to very good in quality; stone free or\r\n    nearly so, one and one-half inches long, one and one-sixteenth\r\n    inches wide, oval to ovate, plump, with deeply grooved\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture deeply grooved along the edges,\r\n    strongly furrowed; dorsal suture deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON FREE\r\n\r\n    =1.= Wickson _Cal.

The fruit is not sufficiently\r\nattractive in appearance to sell well in the markets and, besides, is\r\ntoo thin-skinned to ship or keep well. The quality is very good, the\r\nflavor being sweet, rich and delicious, though possibly the flesh is a\r\nlittle too dry to permit the variety being ranked as \"very good.\" It\r\nis an excellent peach for culinary purposes having the reputation of\r\nmaking a handsomer canned product than any other peach. Lemon Free is\r\nlittle grown in the eastern states but it is one of the leading sorts\r\nof its season in parts of California. The color-plate shows the shape\r\nvery well but the color is not quite that of the real peach.\r\n\r\nThis variety seems to have originated in Ohio about 1885 but nothing\r\nis known of its parentage, originator or introducer. Wickson, in\r\n_California Fruits_, claims California as its birthplace but this, we\r\nthink, is an error. In 1889 the American Pomological Society placed\r\nLemon Free in its fruit-catalog as Lemon but in 1899 changed the name\r\nto Lemon Free.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    hardy, rather unproductive; trunk thick, smooth to medium;\r\n    branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown tinged with light\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets often very long, with a tendency to\r\n    rebranch, with medium to long internodes, pinkish-red with but\r\n    a trace of green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with large, raised,\r\n    russetty lenticels medium in number.\r\n\r\n    Leaves seven inches long, one and three-fourths inches wide,\r\n    folded upward and curled downward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thick, leathery; upper surface dark olive-green, smooth\r\n    becoming rugose along the midrib; lower surface grayish-green;\r\n    margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands;\r\n    petiole three-eighths inch long, with two to six rather\r\n    large, reniform, reddish-brown glands variable in position;\r\n    flower-buds intermediate in size and length, conical to\r\n    pointed, slightly pubescent, usually free; flowers appear in\r\n    mid-season.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in late mid-season; two and one-half inches long,\r\n    two and five-sixteenths inches wide, roundish-oval; cavity\r\n    medium to deep, wide, flaring, often mottled with red; suture\r\n    shallow, becoming deeper at the apex and extending beyond;\r\n    apex mucronate to roundish-mamelon, recurved; color green\r\n    or golden-yellow, with a faint blush and mottled with red;\r\n    pubescence fine, long, thick; skin thin, tender, variable in\r\n    adhesion to the pulp; flesh yellow, juicy, stringy, tender and\r\n    melting, sweet to sprightly, pleasantly flavored; very good in\r\n    quality; stone semi-free to free, one and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, nearly one inch wide, oval, plump, flattened near the\r\n    base, short-pointed, the surfaces usually grooved and with few\r\n    pits; ventral suture winged, deeply marked along the edges,\r\n    narrow; dorsal suture winged, grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEVY\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

It is a round, yellow-fleshed clingstone\r\nof very good quality and might be planted in the parts of New York,\r\nwhere the season permits it to mature, for a very late culinary peach.\r\nIt is one of the favorite peaches to close the season in Southern\r\nfruit-growing sections.\r\n\r\nThe history of Levy is badly confused. More than half a century ago\r\na peach called Henrietta was cultivated. Where or when the variety\r\noriginated no one can tell. In 1881, Downing mentioned a peach under\r\nthe name Levy Late as being a new, late clingstone originating in the\r\ngarden of W. W. Levy, Washington, District of Columbia. Downing gave\r\nHenrietta as a synonym of Levy Late, as have several pomologists since.\r\nFrom these facts, it seems safe to say that the variety is old, that\r\nit was first introduced as Henrietta and that the peach which Mr. Levy\r\nclaimed to have originated was Henrietta. The American Pomological\r\nSociety, in 1899, added this peach to its fruit-list as Henrietta but\r\nin 1909 changed the name to Levy, giving Henrietta as a synonym.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright to quite spreading, hardy,\r\n    productive; trunk thick, rough; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown intermingled with very light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    slender, with internodes dark red or purplish-red mingled\r\n    with light green, smooth, glabrous, with small, numerous,\r\n    conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, oval to obovate-lanceolate, of medium thickness,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dark green, smooth becoming rugose\r\n    along the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; apex acuminate;\r\n    margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands;\r\n    petiole five-sixteenths inch long, with one to six small,\r\n    globose, reddish-brown glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LEMON FREE]\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, conical to pointed, plump, pubescent,\r\n    free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers seven-eighths\r\n    inch across, with varying shades of pink, sometimes in twos;\r\n    pedicels short, medium to thick, glabrous, green; calyx-tube\r\n    reddish-green at the base, orange-colored within, somewhat\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, medium to narrow,\r\n    acute, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals oval, notched\r\n    near the base, tapering to long, narrow claws often tinged with\r\n    red at the base; filaments five-sixteenths inch long, equal to\r\n    the petals in length; pistil pubescent near the base, as long\r\n    as or longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; about two and one-half inches in\r\n    diameter, roundish-cordate, compressed, with very unequal\r\n    halves; cavity medium to deep, wide, abrupt to slightly\r\n    flaring, with tender skin and often twig-marked; suture deep,\r\n    extending beyond the tip; apex mamelon, recurved, a few\r\n    fruits with very large, mucronate tips; color greenish or\r\n    golden-yellow, with splashes of dull red and a lively blush\r\n    covering one cheek; pubescence short, thick, fine; skin thick,\r\n    adherent to the pulp; flesh yellow, juicy, stringy, meaty, mild\r\n    or somewhat astringent, pleasantly flavored; fair to good in\r\n    quality; stone clinging, one and one-half inches long, one inch\r\n    wide, bulged on one side, ovate to oval, plump, winged, with\r\n    surfaces marked by short, red grooves; ventral suture deeply\r\n    furrowed along the edges, wide; dorsal suture a deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOLA\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Del.

On the Station grounds it is the best of its season and one\r\nof the best of all white-fleshed peaches. Moreover, it fills a gap in\r\nthe peach procession that ought to make it valuable in this State.\r\nIt follows Mamie Ross and Greensboro, both of which it surpasses in\r\nappearance and quality. It precedes Champion and is even better than\r\nthat handsome and delicious peach. Since it ripens with the well-known\r\nCarman, fruit-growers will want to know how it compares with that\r\nvariety. It is hardier in bud than Carman, that sort not having a\r\nsingle fruit after the cold winter of 1911-12 while Lola bore a fair\r\ncrop; the fruit is of better quality, larger, hardly as well colored\r\nand on the Station grounds the tree is more productive. Attention of\r\nNew York peach-growers was called to Lola, in words almost identical\r\nwith those here used, in Bulletin 364 from this Station, published in\r\n1913, with the result that it is now being tried in several parts of\r\nthe State and we shall soon know what its commercial value is this far\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThe parentage of Lola is unknown. The variety originated from seed\r\nplanted in 1876 by J. W. Stubenrauch, Mexia, Texas, who named it Miss\r\nLola in honor of his daughter. The American Pomological Society listed\r\nLola in its catalog in 1899 as \"Lolo.\" In 1909, however, the spelling\r\nwas changed to Lola as it is correctly written.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOLA]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; trunk thick, smooth; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown with a light tinge of ash-gray; branchlets very\r\n    long, with internodes of medium length, dark pinkish-red\r\n    intermingled with pale green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    conspicuous, numerous, small, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and one-half inches wide, variable\r\n    in position, oval to obovate-lanceolate, thin; upper surface\r\n    dull, dark green; lower surface silvery-green; apex acuminate;\r\n    margin finely serrate to nearly crenate, glandular; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, with one to five reniform glands\r\n    usually on the petiole.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, obtuse, very plump, heavily pubescent,\r\n    appressed or free; blossoms open early; flowers nearly two\r\n    inches across, light to dark pink, usually in twos; pedicels\r\n    short, slender, glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green\r\n    at the base, greenish-yellow within, somewhat campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent\r\n    without; petals ovate, deeply indented near the base, faintly\r\n    crenate, tapering to narrow claws; filaments one-half inch\r\n    long, shorter than the petals; pistil, pubescent near the base,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and three-eighths\r\n    inches long, two and one-half inches wide, round-oval, usually\r\n    somewhat oblique, compressed, with nearly equal halves; cavity\r\n    deep, wide, abrupt, with tender skin; suture shallow, deepening\r\n    toward the tip; apex small, mucronate, roundish or somewhat\r\n    depressed; color creamy-white blushed with carmine deepened by\r\n    a few dark splashes; pubescence short, thin; skin thin, tough,\r\n    separating from the pulp; flesh white, rayed with red near the\r\n    pit, very juicy, tender and melting, sweet, with a pleasant\r\n    sprightliness; good in quality; stone semi-free to free, one\r\n    and three-eighths inches long, fifteen-sixteenths inch wide,\r\n    obovate, plump, abruptly pointed, with corrugated and pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture wide, winged, deeply furrowed along\r\n    the edges; dorsal suture a deep, narrow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMIE ROSS\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Can.

The fruit has two bad faults: The quality is not\r\nhigh--the flesh being coarse, juicy and insipid in flavor; and the\r\npeaches bruise with the least possible handling so that they cannot be\r\nshipped to advantage. On the Station grounds the pubescence, too, is\r\nso abundant as to be objectionable. Mamie Ross comes at a season when\r\nthere are many other good mid-season, white-fleshed peaches and may,\r\ntherefore, be thrown out of the list for this region. It is, as the\r\ncolor-plate shows, a very handsome peach.\r\n\r\nMamie Ross is probably a seedling of Chinese Cling. It originated about\r\n1881 with Captain A. J. Ross, Dallas, Texas. The variety soon attracted\r\nattention and neighbors began propagating it. Later, Mr. Ross' brother\r\nnamed the peach after the originator's youngest daughter. In 1899, the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit-list.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAMIE ROSS]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading to somewhat drooping,\r\n    open-topped, hardy, productive; trunk thick, smooth; branches\r\n    stocky, smooth, reddish-brown with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    very long, with long internodes, dark red with considerable\r\n    olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous\r\n    conspicuous, raised lenticels variable in size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, variable in position, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thick, leathery; upper surface dark green, smooth becoming\r\n    rugose along the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; margin\r\n    finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, with none to five small, globose and\r\n    reniform, reddish-brown glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds semi-hardy, obtuse to pointed, plump, heavily\r\n    pubescent, free or appressed; blossoms open early; flowers\r\n    one and three-fourths inches across, pink, single; pedicels\r\n    very short, medium to thick, glabrous, green; calyx-tube\r\n    reddish-green at the base, greenish-yellow within, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes acute or obtuse, glabrous within, heavily\r\n    pubescent without; petals oval to obovate, entire except near\r\n    the base, tapering to narrow claws often red at the base;\r\n    filaments one-half inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the base, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-half inches\r\n    long, two and seven-eighths inches wide, roundish-oval to\r\n    oblong, often bulged on one side, compressed, usually with\r\n    sides equal; cavity deep, abrupt, often marked with streaks of\r\n    red; suture variable in depth; apex small, mucronate, set in\r\n    a slight depression; color pale yellowish-cream, with more or\r\n    less dull or bright red in which are splashes of darker red;\r\n    pubescence short, fine, thick; skin thin, tough, separates from\r\n    the pulp; flesh white, streaked with red near the pit, very\r\n    juicy, stringy, tender, melting, sweet or somewhat sprightly,\r\n    pleasantly flavored; good in quality; stone semi-cling or\r\n    cling, one and five-eighths inches long, one inch wide, ovate\r\n    to long-elliptical, plump, long-pointed, bulged on one side,\r\n    with pitted and grooved surfaces; ventral suture deeply grooved\r\n    along the edges, narrow, winged; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY LEE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Del.

It may be as good in\r\nquality as Alexander or Triumph but is no better. The variety is but\r\ndoubtfully worth planting in New York.\r\n\r\nMay Lee originated with E. W.

It is distinguished among\r\npeach varieties by its white flesh--white clear to the pit with no\r\ntrace of red even on the surface or next to the stone. It is further\r\ndistinguished by its sweet, rich flavor--giving it high rank among the\r\nbest of peaches--and by the great productiveness of the trees. Though\r\nundoubtedly the day of Morris White is passed for either commercial or\r\nhome orchards, it might still be used advantageously in breeding late,\r\nwhite-fleshed, freestone peaches.\r\n\r\nWilliam Robert Prince,[263] in his _Pomological Manual_, describes\r\na White Rareripe which he claims originated in the nursery of his\r\ngrandfather and which can be no other than the Morris White under\r\ndiscussion. The origin of the variety will always be in doubt but\r\nprobably the elder Prince originated it in the latter part of the\r\nEighteenth Century. Leroy has confused the history of Morris White\r\nwith that of Red Rareripe, commonly called Morris Red Rareripe, which\r\nprobably originated with Robert Morris, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\r\nLeroy questions the identity of the White Rareripe mentioned by Coxe\r\nbut, although the season of Coxe's sort is a trifle earlier than\r\nLeroy's, the two are probably the same. There was a White Rareripe\r\ngrown for a short time in America many years ago which proved to be\r\nthe old French Nivette renamed. Nivette was not widely disseminated\r\nand probably has long since passed from cultivation in America. Morris\r\nWhite was reported upon at the National Convention of Fruit-Growers\r\nin 1848 and received a place in the list of recommended fruits.\r\nIt continued to be listed in the American Pomological Society's\r\nfruit-catalog until 1891 when it was dropped but was replaced in 1897\r\nand still remains there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORRIS WHITE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading to drooping,\r\n    dense-topped, productive; trunk intermediate in thickness and\r\n    smoothness; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown with very\r\n    light tinge of ash-gray; branchlets long, with long internodes,\r\n    dark red mingled with green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    many conspicuous, small, raised lenticels at the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, flat or curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dull, dark green,\r\n    smooth; lower surface grayish-green; apex long, acuminate;\r\n    margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands;\r\n    petiole three-eighths inch long, with one to five small,\r\n    globose and reniform glands variable in color and position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, obtuse to conical, plump, very pubescent,\r\n    usually free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers less\r\n    than an inch across, pale pink, deepening in color along the\r\n    edges; pedicels short, thick, glabrous, green; calyx-tube\r\n    greenish-red, greenish-yellow within, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals\r\n    oval, narrow; filaments three-eighths inch long, equal to the\r\n    petals in length; pistil longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and one-sixteenth inches long, two and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, cordate-oval or oblate, compressed,\r\n    with halves nearly equal; cavity abrupt or flaring; suture a\r\n    line, becoming deeper toward the tip; apex roundish, depressed\r\n    in the suture, with mucronate tip; color pale white, usually\r\n    without blush or with a faint bronze blush; pubescence heavy,\r\n    long and coarse; skin thin, tough, somewhat adherent; flesh\r\n    white, juicy, tender and melting, sweet, pleasantly flavored;\r\n    good in quality; stone semi-free to nearly free, one and\r\n    one-fourth inches long, seven-eighths inch wide, oval to\r\n    slightly obovate, flattened near the base, with deeply grooved\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture with deep grooves along the edges,\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN ROSE\r\n\r\n    =1.= Tilton _Jour.

Of its parentage nothing is known. Mountain\r\nRose has always been considered a good market variety and has been\r\nwidely disseminated. The American Pomological Society added this peach\r\nto its fruit-list in 1871, a place it has since held.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTAIN ROSE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, low-growing and\r\n    dense-topped, rather unproductive; trunk thick, medium in\r\n    smoothness; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown covered with\r\n    light ash-gray; branchlets thick, long, with internodes of\r\n    medium length, dark red intermingled with olive-green, glossy,\r\n    smooth, glabrous, with numerous conspicuous, large and small\r\n    lenticels raised near the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, flattened or curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thick, leathery; upper surface dull, dark\r\n    green; lower surface grayish-green; apex long-acuminate; margin\r\n    finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long, with two to four small, globose,\r\n    reddish-brown glands variable in position; flower-buds conical\r\n    to pointed, plump, very pubescent, usually appressed; blossoms\r\n    appear in mid-season; flowers small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-eighth inches\r\n    long, two and one-fourth inches wide, roundish-oblate to\r\n    slightly cordate; cavity intermediate in depth and width,\r\n    flaring to abrupt, often twig-marked; suture shallow, becoming\r\n    deeper toward the tip; apex roundish, depressed in the suture,\r\n    with mucronate or sometimes mamelon tip; color creamy-white\r\n    blushed with deep red, with a few splashes of darker red;\r\n    pubescence long, thick; skin thin, tough, variable in adhesion;\r\n    flesh white, stained red near the pit, juicy, tender and\r\n    melting, sweet, mild, pleasantly flavored; good to very good\r\n    in quality; stone free, one and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    seven-eighths inch wide, oval to ovate, plump, bulged on one\r\n    side, contracted toward the base, tapering to a short point,\r\n    usually with small pits in the surfaces; ventral suture deeply\r\n    grooved along the sides, furrowed; dorsal suture grooved,\r\n    faintly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuir\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

California peaches are selected for canning, evaporating and\r\nshipping, whereas New York varieties are dessert fruits. Muir is a\r\nCalifornia sort suitable only for culinary purposes--attractive enough\r\ninside but so unattractive externally that it could tempt no one who\r\ndid not know the fruit to be sweet and delicious in flavor. It is a\r\nlate mid-season, yellow-fleshed, freestone peach much used by canners\r\non the Pacific slope. It ought to be more generally grown for the same\r\npurpose in the East; for, as a canned product, it is hardly surpassed\r\nin appearance or quality. The trees are vigorous, productive and little\r\nsubject to leaf-curl but the fruits in New York are often marred by\r\npeach-scab. The variety seems perfectly at home in this State as,\r\nseemingly, it is in most peach-regions. In fruit-characters, Muir is\r\nvery similar to Wager.\r\n\r\nThe variety was found more than twenty-five years ago on the farm\r\nof John Muir, near Silveyville, California. G. W. Thissell, Winters,\r\nCalifornia, named and introduced Muir. The American Pomological Society\r\nadded this peach to its fruit-list in 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUIR]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright or somewhat spreading, hardy,\r\n    productive; trunk rough; branches smooth, ash-gray over\r\n    reddish-brown; branchlets slender, long, with short internodes,\r\n    dark pinkish-red with but a trace of green, smooth, glabrous,\r\n    with inconspicuous, small, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves fall early in the season, six and three-fourths inches\r\n    long, one and three-eighths inches wide, flat or somewhat\r\n    curled downward, oval-lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dull,\r\n    dark green, nearly smooth; lower surface olive-green; apex\r\n    acuminate; margin bluntly serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole seven-sixteenths inch long, with one to five\r\n    large, reniform glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds small, short, obtuse, very plump, heavily\r\n    pubescent, appressed; blossoms open late; flowers seven-eighths\r\n    inch across; pale pink, darker about the edges, usually\r\n    singly; pedicels short, green; calyx-tube reddish-green,\r\n    orange-red within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short,\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals narrow-oval\r\n    or ovate, tapering to claws of medium width; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil\r\n    as long as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and three-fourths inches\r\n    long, two and three-eighths inches wide, roundish-cordate\r\n    or oval, slightly angular, compressed, with unequal halves;\r\n    cavity shallow, contracted about the sides, abrupt or flaring;\r\n    suture medium in depth; apex pointed, with a large, recurved,\r\n    mamelon tip; color greenish or lemon-yellow, with little if\r\n    any blush; pubescence heavy, long; skin thin, tough, separates\r\n    from the pulp when fully ripe; flesh yellow, faintly tinged\r\n    with red near the pit, dry, coarse, tender, sweet, mild; good\r\n    in quality; stone free, one and seven-sixteenths inches long,\r\n    fifteen-sixteenths inch wide, ovate, flattened, wedge-shape\r\n    toward the base, tapering to a long apex, with large pits and\r\n    a few small grooves in the surfaces; ventral suture deeply\r\n    grooved along the sides, very wide, deeply furrowed; dorsal\r\n    suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIAGARA\r\n\r\n    =1.= _W.

The Crawford group, though a dominant\r\ntype, is, as we have several times pointed out, a little too capricious\r\nas to soil and climate to suit the needs of commercial peach-growers,\r\nfailing to bear regularly or abundantly in most soils. For this reason\r\nthe once very popular Early and Late Crawfords are now seldom grown.\r\nAll who know these varieties regret that a sort of their type, without\r\ntheir faults, has not yet come to light. In New York the best of\r\nthe comparatively new Crawford-like peaches is Niagara, said to be a\r\nseedling of one of the Crawfords. The fruit ripens later than Early\r\nCrawford, averages larger, is borne more abundantly and holds its\r\nsize better to the end of the season. But Niagara's great point of\r\nmerit, as compared with Crawford, is that it is more dependable in\r\nall tree-characters, being, especially, less capricious as to soil\r\nand climate. Niagara, as the color-plate shows it, is a beautiful\r\nfruit, yellow, with a handsome over-color of red. The flesh, too,\r\nis attractive and delectable--yellow, thick and firm, with a rich,\r\nsweet flavor which makes it one of the most palatable peaches of its\r\nseason. It is, as are most of its type, a freestone. Niagara fails in\r\nproductiveness in some localities, having in this respect the fault\r\nof all its tribe; but it should have a welcome place in any home\r\ncollection and, where it proves productive, is one of the best for\r\ngeneral market.\r\n\r\nNiagara probably came originally from Maryland to Julius Harris,\r\nRidgeway, New York. Later it was sold to a grower near Lockport, New\r\nYork, who disposed of it to a Mr. Corwin, Newfane, Niagara County, New\r\nYork, who called it Corwin's Crawford. It then came into possession\r\nof the Rogers Nurseries, Dansville, New York, from whom this Station\r\nreceived its trees under the name Niagara. It is probably a seedling\r\nof Early Crawford. Niagara was added to the fruit-list of the American\r\nPomological Society in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIAGARA]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, upright-spreading, hardy, medium in productiveness;\r\n    trunk thick and smooth; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    mingled with light ash-gray; branchlets thick, red intermingled\r\n    with olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous,\r\n    large, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, flattened or curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dull, dark green,\r\n    rugose along the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; apex\r\n    acuminate; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one\r\n    to five small, globose, raised, reddish-brown glands variable\r\n    in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, long, conical or pointed, very plump,\r\n    pubescent, usually free; blossoms open in mid-season; flowers\r\n    one inch across, white near the center of the petals changing\r\n    to dark pink near the edges; pedicels very short, thick,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-colored\r\n    within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, acute,\r\n    glabrous within, pubescent without; petals round-oval, tapering\r\n    toward the apex, broadly notched near the base, contracting to\r\n    claws red at the base; filaments three-eighths inch long, equal\r\n    to or shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent at the ovary,\r\n    longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-half inches long,\r\n    two and three-eighths inches wide, round-cordate to oval,\r\n    compressed, with equal halves; cavity medium to deep, flaring\r\n    to abrupt, with very tender skin, often splashed with red;\r\n    suture shallow, deepening toward the apex and often extending\r\n    beyond; apex rounded or pointed, with a mamelon and sometimes\r\n    recurved tip; color orange-yellow, blushed with deep, dull red,\r\n    with stripes and splashes of darker red; pubescence short,\r\n    thick, fine; skin thick, tough, adherent to the pulp; flesh\r\n    yellow, deeply tinged with red near the pit, juicy, coarse\r\n    but tender, sprightly; very good in quality; stone free, one\r\n    and five-eighths inches long, one and one-eighth inches wide,\r\n    broadly ovate, plump, with long point at the apex, usually with\r\n    grooved surfaces and with few pits, tinged with red; ventral\r\n    suture very deeply grooved along the sides, winged, rather\r\n    wide; dorsal suture deeply grooved, wing-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLDMIXON CLING\r\n\r\n    =1.= Coxe _Cult.

It is a rich,\r\nluscious, white-fleshed peach, ripening late, which, besides being\r\nexcellent in quality for dessert and culinary purposes, is uncommonly\r\nhandsome--a combination of characters possessed by few other peaches.\r\nThe color-plate is almost a perfect picture of the variety and could\r\nthe flavor be as well conveyed to readers, Oldmixon Cling might again\r\ntake on some of its one time popularity. We can discover but one fault\r\nin the fruits as they grow on the Station grounds--the pits crack\r\nbadly. The variety, however, seems to be passing out because the trees\r\nare not, as a rule, fruitful though in all other respects they are\r\nseemingly near perfection.\r\n\r\nThere is no trace of when, where or how Oldmixon Cling originated.\r\nCoxe[264] first set forth its merits in 1817. It is reported to have\r\nbeen introduced from Europe by Sir John Oldmixon but Downing\r\nbelieves that it was the pit and not the tree which Oldmixon brought\r\nto America. At any rate the variety takes its name from its supposed\r\nintroducer. If the pit were planted by Sir John Oldmixon, this must be\r\nthe oldest of our peaches for Oldmixon came to America nearly 200 years\r\nago. He was, by the way, the author of one of the early and notable\r\nbooks on America, _The British Empire in America_, published in London\r\nin 1741. Pomologists from time to time have made two words of the name\r\nmaking it appear that old and new Mixon peaches existed. Oldmixon Cling\r\nwas placed in the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in\r\n1856 and ever since has retained a place there. In 1881 the Society\r\nchanged the name from Old Mixon Cling to Oldmixon Cling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLDMIXON CLING]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, rather\r\n    unproductive; trunk medium to thick, smooth; branches stocky,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown tinged with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    of medium thickness and length, with tendency to rebranch, red\r\n    intermingled with dull green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous conspicuous, large, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, flattened or curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dark green, smooth\r\n    becoming rugose along the midrib; margin finely serrate, tipped\r\n    with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    with one to four small, globose glands variable in color and\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, conical or pointed, plump, pubescent,\r\n    appressed or somewhat free; blossoms appear in mid-season;\r\n    flowers three-fourths inch across, light pink at the center\r\n    deepening to darker pink at the margins, often in twos,\r\n    sometimes in threes; pedicels short, green; calyx-tube\r\n    reddish-green at the base, greenish-yellow within, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes short, narrow, acute, glabrous within,\r\n    pubescent without; petals round-oval, nearly entire, tapering\r\n    to claws tinged with red at the base; filaments three-eighths\r\n    inch long, equal to or longer than the petals; pistil pubescent\r\n    near the base, usually equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; about two and one-half inches in diameter,\r\n    round or roundish-oval, bulged along one side, compressed, with\r\n    unequal halves; cavity medium to deep, wide, variable in shape;\r\n    suture shallow, becoming deeper toward the apex and extending\r\n    beyond; apex round, with a recurved, mucronate or prominent\r\n    and prolonged mamelon tip; color creamy-white, with a blush of\r\n    lively red and faint splashes of darker red; pubescence fine,\r\n    short, thick; skin thin, tough, separates from the pulp; flesh\r\n    white, faintly stained with red near the pit, juicy, stringy,\r\n    tender, melting, sweet but sprightly, pleasantly flavored;\r\n    very good in quality; stone clinging, one and seven-sixteenths\r\n    inches long, one and one-eighth inches wide, ovate to\r\n    oval, bulged on one side, flattened near the base, plump,\r\n    long-pointed, with grooved surfaces; ventral suture deeply\r\n    grooved along the edges, furrowed; dorsal suture grooved, with\r\n    tendency to wing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLDMIXON FREE\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kenrick _Am.

Side by side, outwardly, the two peaches\r\ncan hardly be told apart. Since Oldmixon Cling is sometimes semi-free\r\nand Oldmixon Free often clings more or less, the two are often confused\r\nin orchards and markets. Both of these Oldmixons, as those who live\r\nin regions where cold and frost do frequent damage should know, are\r\nas hardy in wood and bud as any of the white-fleshed varieties. The\r\nblossoms of both, too, appear in late mid-season, thereby often\r\nescaping frosts. The trees of Oldmixon Free, like those of Oldmixon\r\nCling, have the fault of being unproductive.\r\n\r\nOldmixon Free is supposed to be an American seedling of Oldmixon Cling,\r\na fruit for the introduction of which we are indebted to Sir John\r\nOldmixon of early colonial fame. At the Convention of Fruit-Growers\r\nheld in 1848, Oldmixon Free was placed on the list of recommended\r\npeaches. In 1856 it appeared in the fruit-list of the American\r\nPomological Society where it still remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLDMIXON FREE]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, upright to spreading, hardy, rather\r\n    unproductive; trunk thick, smooth; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown tinged with light ash-gray; branchlets of\r\n    medium thickness and length, with tendency to rebranch, dark,\r\n    deep red intermingled with olive-green, glossy, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with conspicuous, numerous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and seven-eighths inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, curled downward or flattened, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery, dull, dark green, smooth; lower\r\n    surface grayish-green; apex acuminate; margins finely serrate,\r\n    tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch\r\n    long, glandless or with one to four small, globose glands\r\n    variable in color and position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds half-hardy, conical to pointed, plump, pubescent,\r\n    free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers three-fourths inch\r\n    across, pale pink near the center becoming darker pink at the\r\n    outside, often in twos; pedicels very short, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green at the base, greenish-yellow within,\r\n    obconic; calyx-lobes short, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent\r\n    without; petals oval, faintly notched near the base, tapering\r\n    to narrow, long claws tinged with red at the base; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil\r\n    pubescent near the base, equal to or longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and one-half inches long, two and\r\n    three-fourths inches wide, round-cordate, usually bulged on\r\n    one side, often compressed, with unequal sides; cavity medium\r\n    to deep, abrupt or flaring, tinged with red; suture shallow,\r\n    becoming deeper toward the apex and extending beyond; apex\r\n    roundish, with a mucronate or recurved, mamelon tip; color\r\n    creamy-white more or less overspread with a lively red blush\r\n    in which are faint splashes and mottlings of darker red;\r\n    pubescence coarse, thick; skin thin, tough, separates from\r\n    the pulp; flesh white, deeply tinted with red near the pit,\r\n    juicy, stringy, tender and melting, sweet, with more or less\r\n    sprightliness; very good in quality; stone free or nearly free,\r\n    one and three-eighths inches long, one and one-eighth inches\r\n    wide, oval to ovate, bulged, flattened near the base, with\r\n    grooved and purplish-brown surfaces; ventral suture deeply\r\n    grooved near the edges, furrowed, faintly winged; dorsal suture\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPULENT\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ill.

The fruits are attractive in\r\nappearance but not uncommonly so and are often marred, as they grow\r\nin New York, by peach-scab. The quality is scarcely better than the\r\naverage and is ruined for most peach-lovers by a bitter tang, though to\r\nothers this almond-like bitterness in the flavor may be a commendation.\r\nThe variety ripens in mid-season. The trees are scarcely more\r\nsatisfactory on the Station grounds than the fruits, being unproductive\r\nand none too vigorous. The chief claim this peach has to public notice\r\nis that it is a cross between a peach and a nectarine. Though as\r\nyet not thoroughly tried in New York, it is safe to say that it is\r\nworthless for this region.\r\n\r\nOpulent was sent out several years ago by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa,\r\nCalifornia, as a hybrid between the Muir peach and New White Nectarine.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading with a tendency to\r\n    droop, medium in productiveness; trunk smooth; branches\r\n    stocky, smooth, reddish-brown with a light ash-gray tinge;\r\n    branchlets slender, long, with medium to long internodes, dull\r\n    red intermingled with green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels few in number.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, flattened or curled downward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    leathery, dark green, smooth becoming rugose along the midrib;\r\n    lower surface grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with\r\n    reddish-brown glands; petiole one-half inch long, with one to\r\n    six small, globose and reniform, reddish-brown glands variable\r\n    in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, large, long, conical or obtuse, pubescent,\r\n    plump, free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers one and\r\n    one-eighth inches across, white at the center of the petals\r\n    becoming dark pink near the margins; pedicels short, glabrous,\r\n    green; calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-colored within,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, narrow, acute,\r\n    glabrous within, pubescent without; petals oval or roundish,\r\n    broadly notched, tapering to long, narrow claws red at the\r\n    base; filaments five-sixteenths inch long, equal to the petals\r\n    in length; pistil pubescent at the ovary, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-half inches\r\n    long, two and seven-sixteenths inches wide, round-oval,\r\n    compressed, with unequal halves; cavity deep, abrupt, often\r\n    marked with red; suture a mere line or very shallow, often a\r\n    slight depression just beyond the point; apex roundish, with a\r\n    mucronate and recurved tip; color creamy-white, with a faint\r\n    blush, speckled and striped with darker red; pubescence short;\r\n    skin tough, separates from the pulp; flesh white, juicy,\r\n    stringy, tender, melting, sweet but sprightly; fair in quality;\r\n    stone free, one and five-sixteenths inches long, seven-eighths\r\n    inch wide, ovate to slightly oval, flattened at the base,\r\n    plump, short-pointed, with pitted surfaces marked by few\r\n    grooves; ventral suture deeply furrowed along the edges, medium\r\n    in width, furrowed; dorsal suture deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALLAS\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

Bul._ =170=:178. 1906.\r\n\r\nPallas is about the best of the several honey-flavored, beaked peaches\r\nthat have fruited on the Station grounds. This is one of the sorts\r\nsupposed to thrive only in warm climates but here, in a location none\r\ntoo favorably situated as to climate, the trees are vigorous, appear to\r\nbe hardy and differ from northern varieties, so far as life events are\r\nconcerned, only in holding their leaves longer. The fruits run small\r\nand lack uniformity in size, faults that will not permit Pallas ever\r\nto become a commercial sort in New York. Moreover, the peaches are not\r\nattractive in appearance, suffer terribly from brown-rot and do not\r\nship well--further disqualifications for competition in commerce. In\r\nquality, especially, to those who have a taste for sweets, Pallas is\r\nalmost unapproachable--so rich, sweet, aromatic and delicious as well\r\nto justify the sobriquet, \"Honeydew,\" frequently bestowed upon it. This\r\nvariety might well be planted in every home orchard.\r\n\r\nPallas is one of the many seedlings of Honey and originated in\r\n1878 with L. E. Berckmans, Augusta, Georgia. In 1891 the American\r\nPomological Society added Pallas to its list of fruits as a noteworthy\r\nvariety for southern fruit-districts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALLAS]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in vigor, upright-spreading, round-topped,\r\n    productive; trunk rough; branches roughened by the lenticels,\r\n    brownish intermingled with ash-gray and a little red;\r\n    branchlets slender, with internodes of medium length, dark\r\n    pinkish-red mingled with green, smooth, glabrous, with numerous\r\n    conspicuous, small, raised, russet-colored lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves fall late in the season, six inches long, one and\r\n    one-half inches wide, variable in position, ovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thin, leathery; upper surface dull, dark green, smooth; lower\r\n    surface olive-green; margin sharply and often doubly serrate,\r\n    glandular; petiole three-eighths inch long, stout, glandless or\r\n    with one to three small, globose glands usually at the base of\r\n    the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, long, conical, plump, pubescent,\r\n    conspicuous, usually free; flowers appear in mid-season, light\r\n    pink changing to darker red; pedicels thick, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube red, yellowish-green within, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes obtuse, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without;\r\n    petals oval, entire, red at the base; filaments shorter than\r\n    the petals; pistil pubescent, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, two inches wide, pointed-oval, compressed, with halves\r\n    equal; cavity shallow, flaring, with tender skin; suture\r\n    shallow; apex a characteristically long, straight tip; color\r\n    pale white or greenish-white occasionally with a bright red\r\n    blush but mostly with dull mottlings; pubescence medium in\r\n    amount; skin thick, tough; flesh white, scarcely stained at\r\n    the pit, very juicy, sweet, tender and melting, high-flavored;\r\n    very good in quality; stone free, one and five-sixteenths\r\n    inches long, seven-eighths inch wide, oval to ovate, slightly\r\n    wedge-shaped at the base, plump, conspicuously winged,\r\n    long-pointed, with pitted and grooved surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    narrow, furrowed; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARSON\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Del.

It is\r\na large, handsomely-colored, white-fleshed, freestone peach of good\r\nquality which ripens ten days before Champion. There are, it is true,\r\na good many white-fleshed peaches at this season but Pearson is an\r\nexceptionally good one, much excelling Mamie Ross with which it might\r\nhave to compete although the latter ripens a little later. The trees\r\nare very vigorous, productive and, so far, about as healthy as any on\r\nthe Station grounds.\r\n\r\nPearson originated with J. M. Pearson, McKinney, Texas. Its parentage\r\nis unknown. The variety was introduced by E.W. Kirkpatrick of McKinney,\r\nwho thinks it may be a seedling of Chinese Cling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEARSON]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, the lower branches drooping,\r\n    very productive; trunk medium in thickness, smooth; branches\r\n    stocky, smooth, reddish-brown mingled with light ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets slender, short, with short internodes, dark red\r\n    mingled with olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with few\r\n    inconspicuous lenticels variable in size and raised toward the\r\n    base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves seven inches long, one and three-fourths inches wide,\r\n    variable in position, oval to obovate-lanceolate, leathery;\r\n    upper surface dark, dull green, smooth becoming rugose along\r\n    the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; apex long and narrow;\r\n    margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands;\r\n    petiole three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to four\r\n    small, globose, reddish-brown glands usually at the base of the\r\n    blade.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, long, heavily pubescent, conical to\r\n    obtuse, plump, appressed or partly free; blossoms appear\r\n    very early; flowers nearly two inches across, pink, usually\r\n    single; pedicels short, of medium thickness, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube dark, dull reddish-green, greenish-yellow within,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes broad, often emarginated,\r\n    acute or obtuse, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without;\r\n    petals oval to roundish-obovate, tapering to long, narrow\r\n    claws; filaments about one-half inch long, shorter than the\r\n    petals; pistil pubescent only at the base, equal to the stamens\r\n    in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, two and three-sixteenths inches wide, round-oval or\r\n    somewhat cordate, compressed, with unequal halves, bulged near\r\n    the apex; cavity medium to deep, abrupt or flaring, with tender\r\n    skin; suture quite variable in depth; apex round or depressed,\r\n    with a small, mucronate or recurved, mamelon tip; color\r\n    greenish-white, with a blush covering much of the surface,\r\n    more or less mottled; pubescence thin, fine, short; skin\r\n    thin, tough, semi-free; flesh white, faintly tinged with red\r\n    near the pit, juicy, stringy, tender and melting, pleasantly\r\n    flavored; good in quality; stone semi-clinging or free, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches long, one inch wide, oval, flattened at\r\n    the base, winged, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture deeply\r\n    grooved near the edges, narrow; dorsal suture grooved, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEENTO\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

The variety is too\r\ntender to cold to be grown in New York; in fact it succeeds only in\r\nFlorida and the warmest parts of the other Gulf States. The American\r\nPomological Society listed Peento in its fruit-catalog in 1889. The\r\nfollowing description, as it applies to the tree, has been compiled:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEENTO\r\n\r\n[Reproduced from Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London\r\nIV: 512. 1822.]]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, open-topped, too tender for the North, variable\r\n    in productiveness; leaves mature late, four and one-half inches\r\n    long, one and seven-sixteenths inches wide, oblong-oval, thin,\r\n    leathery; upper surface light olive-green, smooth; lower\r\n    surface grayish-green; margin coarsely serrate, tipped with\r\n    dark glands; petiole with two or three reniform glands of\r\n    medium size, gray or greenish-yellow, usually at the base.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; one and three-eighths inches long, two\r\n    and seven-sixteenths inches wide, strongly oblate; cavity\r\n    shallow, very wide, flaring, twig-marked; suture deep, wide,\r\n    extending two-thirds around the fruit; apex depressed, set in\r\n    a large, wide, flaring basin; color creamy-yellow, mottled\r\n    and delicately pencilled with red, often blushed toward the\r\n    apex; pubescence short, thick; skin thick, tough, nearly\r\n    free; flesh white, stained red at the stone, juicy, stringy,\r\n    tender and melting, sweet, mild, with an almond-like flavor;\r\n    very good in quality; stone clings, red, one-half inch long,\r\n    fifteen-sixteenths inch wide, strongly oblate, with corrugated\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture very deep at the edges, narrow at the\r\n    base, becoming wide at the apex; dorsal suture a wide, deep\r\n    groove, merging into a line at the apex.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLIFIC\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

Time has not dealt\r\nkindly with the variety and it is doubtful if it is as popular now\r\nas it was a few years after its introduction. The trees are very\r\nsatisfactory, excelling most of their orchard-associates in vigor,\r\nsize, health, hardiness and productiveness but the peaches fall below\r\nthe mark in several characters. The fruits are of but medium size and\r\nnot uncommonly attractive in color, though handsome enough, but too\r\npoor in quality to rate high among the peaches of its season which is\r\na few days before Elberta. The flesh is yellow, firm, dry and little\r\nattacked by rot. With the qualities just named, the variety is, of\r\ncourse, a good shipper and might be in demand in the markets for\r\nculinary purposes. We doubt whether the peach should be largely planted\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\nFurther than that Prolific comes from Michigan, nothing is known of\r\nits parentage, the originator or the date of origin. It was introduced\r\nabout 1890 by Greening Brothers, Monroe, Michigan, under the name New\r\nProlific. In 1909 the American Pomological Society added this peach to\r\nits fruit-list as New Prolific.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROLIFIC]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, becoming drooping,\r\n    open-topped, very productive; trunk rough; branches stocky,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown with a very light tinge of ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets deep, dull red intermingled with green, glossy,\r\n    smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous, numerous lenticels raised\r\n    near the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, variable in position, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dull, dark green, smooth, becoming\r\n    rugose near the midrib; lower surface grayish-green;\r\n    apex long-acuminate; margin finely serrate, tipped with\r\n    reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with\r\n    from one to five small, globose glands variable in color and\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, conical to obtuse, plump, somewhat\r\n    pubescent, appressed or free; blossoms open early; flowers\r\n    one and five-sixteenths inches across, white near the center\r\n    becoming pink along the edges; pedicels very short, glabrous,\r\n    green; calyx-tube dull, dark reddish-green, orange-colored\r\n    within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, acute,\r\n    glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals\r\n    roundish-ovate to oval, broadly notched near the base, tapering\r\n    to narrow claws red at the base; filaments seven-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil pubescent at\r\n    the ovary, as long as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-fourth inches long,\r\n    two and three-eighths inches wide, round-oval to cordate,\r\n    bulged on one side, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity\r\n    deep, usually abrupt, frequently mottled with red; suture a\r\n    line, becoming deeper toward the tip; apex round or somewhat\r\n    pointed, with a recurved, mamelon tip; color light orange,\r\n    mottled and blushed with red; pubescence thick, fine; skin\r\n    thin, tough, separates from the pulp; flesh light yellow,\r\n    stained with red near the pit, medium juicy, coarse, stringy,\r\n    tender, sweet, mild, pleasantly flavored; good in quality;\r\n    stone free, one and three-eighths inches long, one inch wide,\r\n    ovate, bulged on one side, plump, with long, pointed apex,\r\n    with surfaces grooved and marked by small pits; ventral suture\r\n    deeply grooved along the sides, slightly winged near the base;\r\n    dorsal suture a deep groove, faintly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAY\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Del.

We doubt if\r\nRay, however, should find a place on the peach-list for New York.\r\nSeveral faults condemn it; worst of all, the trees are not\r\nproductive. Add to unproductiveness, lack of uniformity in size, shape,\r\ncolor and flavor and the variety is out of the race as a commercial\r\nsort. This far north, too, the trees suffer from winter injury. The\r\nvariety is remarkable for its foliage. Were it not for the fact that\r\nRay is well spoken of in several other states, and the possibility\r\nthat it might do better in other parts of New York than on the Station\r\ngrounds, we should not place it among the major varieties in _The\r\nPeaches of New York_. It is said to be an excellent shipper.\r\n\r\nThis peach is occasionally confused with Raymond Cling, which\r\noriginated in Mississippi many years ago and which has long since\r\npassed from cultivation. The present variety originated with D. Ray,\r\nTyler, Texas. Its parentage is unknown. The American Pomological\r\nSociety placed Ray on its fruit-list in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAY]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, the lower branches\r\n    drooping, medium in productiveness; trunk thick, nearly smooth;\r\n    branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown with a light tinge\r\n    of ash-gray; branchlets slender, dark red intermingled with\r\n    olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous raised\r\n    lenticels variable in size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, flattened or curled downward, oval to obovate\r\n    lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dark green, smooth;\r\n    lower surface medium green; margin finely serrate, tipped\r\n    with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    glandless or with one to three small, globose glands variable\r\n    in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds half-hardy, short, heavily pubescent, conical\r\n    to pointed, plump, usually appressed; blossoms appear in\r\n    mid-season; flowers one inch across, light pink becoming darker\r\n    pink along the edges; pedicels short; calyx-tube reddish-green,\r\n    greenish-yellow within, obconic; calyx-lobes long, narrow,\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals\r\n    ovate, with claws medium in length and width; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the base, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and three-eighths inches long,\r\n    two and one-half inches wide, roundish-conic to oblong-conic,\r\n    slightly compressed, with nearly equal halves; cavity narrow,\r\n    abrupt, with tender skin; suture shallow, deepening toward and\r\n    often extending beyond the tip; apex round, with a mucronate\r\n    tip; color greenish-white changing to white, scarcely blushed\r\n    or with a bright pinkish-red blush varying from a small amount\r\n    to about one-third of the surface, faintly mottled; pubescence\r\n    coarse, thick, long; skin very thin, tough, separates from the\r\n    pulp; flesh greenish-white, stained with red near the pit,\r\n    juicy, stringy, firm but tender, aromatic, sprightly; good in\r\n    quality; stone semi-free to free, one and seven-sixteenths\r\n    inches long, slightly more than one inch wide, oval to ovate,\r\n    plump, with short point at the apex, with grooved and pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture deeply grooved along the edges,\r\n    narrow, furrowed; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED CHEEK MELOCOTON.\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Pom.

Lack of vigor and unproductiveness have driven\r\nRed Cheek Melocoton from common cultivation--indeed it is now almost\r\nimpossible to obtain the trees. We give the variety attention in _The\r\nPeaches of New York_, not because of present worth, but because of\r\nthe prominent part it has played in the peach-industry of the country\r\nin the past. The color-plate is an admirable reproduction of this\r\nold peach though possibly the fruits run a little larger than in the\r\nillustration. The derivation of \"Melocoton,\" so often used in this\r\ntext, is given on page 51.\r\n\r\nRed Cheek Melocoton is an American seedling which, according to William\r\nPrince, sprang from a bud of a stock on which Lemon Cling had been\r\ngrafted, at the Prince farm, Flushing, New York. The Princes were so\r\nimpressed with the seedling that they propagated it, giving it the name\r\nRed Cheek Malacatune, the name Malacatune at that time being given to\r\nall yellow peaches having little red. The discovery of the variety in\r\nthe Prince orchards dates back considerably over one hundred years.\r\nFrom Red Cheek Melocoton the Crawfords and several other notable\r\npeaches are said to have come. In 1867 the American Pomological Society\r\nplaced this variety in its catalog as Red Cheek Melocoton but in 1909\r\nshortened the name to Red Cheek. We prefer to preserve the old name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED CHEEK MELOCOTON]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, lacking in\r\n    productiveness; trunk intermediate in thickness and smoothness;\r\n    branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown mingled with light\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets thick, variable in length, with medium\r\n    to long internodes, deep, dark red intermingled with green,\r\n    glossy, roughened by the lenticels, glabrous, with a few\r\n    smallish, inconspicuous lenticels which are raised toward the\r\n    base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves seven and one-fourth inches long, nearly two inches\r\n    wide, variable in position, oval to obovate-lanceolate, medium\r\n    in thickness, leathery, dark olive-green, smooth, becoming\r\n    rugose toward the midrib; margin sharply serrate; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to three small,\r\n    globose, alternate glands variable in color and in their\r\n    position; flower-buds intermediate in size and length, conical\r\n    or pointed, plump, free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers\r\n    small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, about two and one-half inches wide, roundish-cordate,\r\n    compressed, with halves nearly equal; cavity wide, deep,\r\n    flaring or abrupt; suture shallow; apex roundish, with a\r\n    mucronate or mamelon tip; color deep golden-yellow, splashed,\r\n    blushed and mottled with red; pubescence heavy; skin thick,\r\n    tough, adherent to the pulp; flesh rayed with red near the pit,\r\n    yellow, juicy, firm but tender, sweet, pleasantly flavored;\r\n    good in quality; stone free, one and one-half inches long, one\r\n    inch wide, ovate, more or less bulged at one side and drawn out\r\n    near the base, plump, rather long-pointed, with short grooves\r\n    and pits in the surfaces; ventral suture winged, medium in\r\n    thickness, deeply grooved and furrowed along the edges; dorsal\r\n    suture a narrow groove, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nREEVES\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Tex.

In its day it was justly celebrated for the high quality\r\nof its yellow-fleshed, freestone fruits which are as handsome as they\r\nare palatable. The peaches have but two minor defects to keep them from\r\nperfection--they are a little too irregular in shape and sometimes\r\nfall short in size. In texture of flesh, juiciness, taste and aroma\r\nthey are scarcely surpassed. The fault that condemns the variety is\r\nunproductiveness in the trees. Under average conditions, Reeves is\r\nscarcely as productive as the Crawfords which are rated by all as about\r\nthe poorest bearers. Making up in some degree for unfruitfulness,\r\nthe trees are vigorous and more than usually hardy. It can hardly be\r\nexpected that so poor a bearer will prove profitable in commercial\r\nplantations but Reeves is worthy of perpetuation for home orchards.\r\n\r\nThis attractive peach came from a chance seedling found about sixty\r\nyears ago by Samuel Reeves, Salem, New Jersey. The variety has for many\r\nyears gone under the name Reeves' Favorite and was so listed in the\r\nfruit-catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1875 but in 1909\r\nthe name was shortened by the Society to Reeves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REEVES]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy,\r\n    rather unproductive; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    with light ash-gray; branchlets intermediate in thickness and\r\n    length, with a tendency to rebranch, dark pinkish-red with\r\n    some olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with moderately\r\n    conspicuous lenticels raised and breaking the bark near the\r\n    base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, variable in position, oval to obovate-lanceolate;\r\n    upper surface dark olive-green, smooth becoming rugose along\r\n    the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; apex acuminate;\r\n    margin finely serrate, with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to three small,\r\n    globose glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, medium in size and length, pubescent,\r\n    conical or pointed, plump, free; blossoms open late;\r\n    flowers seven-eighths inch across, light and dark pink,\r\n    well distributed; pedicels very short, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green at the base, orange-colored within,\r\n    obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes medium to narrow, acute,\r\n    glabrous within, pubescent without; petals oval to ovate,\r\n    tapering to claws red at the base; filaments three-eighths inch\r\n    long, equal to the petals in length; pistil pubescent near the\r\n    base, as long as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and three-eighths inches\r\n    long, two and one-half inches wide, round-cordate, bulged at\r\n    one side, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity often very\r\n    deep, flaring or abrupt, the skin tender and often marked with\r\n    red; suture shallow, sometimes extending beyond both cavity\r\n    and tip; apex pointed or rounded, with a prominent, recurved,\r\n    mamelon tip; color deep yellow, blushed with dull red,\r\n    striped, splashed and mottled with brighter red; pubescence\r\n    thick, long; skin thick, tough, separates from the pulp;\r\n    flesh yellow, tinged with red near the pit, juicy, stringy,\r\n    tender and melting, pleasantly flavored, mild, sweet; very\r\n    good in quality; stone free, one and three-eighths inches\r\n    long, fifteen-sixteenths inch wide, ovate to oval, more or\r\n    less bulged near the apex, sometimes winged along the ventral\r\n    suture, with pitted and grooved surfaces; ventral suture deeply\r\n    furrowed along the sides, narrow, grooved; dorsal suture small,\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVERS\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

The peach, of all tree-fruits, best proves\r\nthe general rule that American varieties of fruits are best adapted\r\nto American conditions. Perhaps to Rivers may be added three or four\r\nmore exotic peaches which are now and then planted in this country\r\nbut all are passing out so rapidly that we shall soon be standing on\r\na basis in peach-growing which is wholly American. Earliness and high\r\nquality of fruit keep Rivers alive in private places in America. No\r\none would think of planting it in a commercial orchard because of its\r\nsmall fruit, tender skin and flesh which show every bruise, and its\r\nsusceptibility to brown-rot. It is a white-fleshed freestone, tender,\r\njuicy and with an exceedingly rich, sugary flavor with a savoring smack\r\nof the nectarine. This variety stands almost alone in beauty of flesh\r\nwhich is white to the stone, translucent and more or less mottled and\r\ninterspersed with white veins. At its best the fruits are rather large\r\nand quite handsome as they grow in America, but even so they are but a\r\nshadow of the peach described under this name in European fruit-books.\r\nThe trees are fairly satisfactory in all essential characters.\r\n\r\nRivers originated with Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England, about\r\n1865 as a seedling of Early Silver. Soon after its introduction in\r\nEngland it was brought to America. The American Pomological Society\r\nlisted the variety in its fruit-catalog in 1875 as Early Rivers but in\r\n1883 changed the name to Rivers though it is still popularly known as\r\nEarly Rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIVERS]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, with inclination to\r\n    droop, round-topped, hardy, productive; trunk thick; branches\r\n    stocky, smooth, dark reddish-brown overspread with light\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets long, with internodes olive-green overlaid\r\n    with thin brownish-red, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous\r\n    conspicuous, large and small lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and three-fourths inches long, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward and somewhat recurved, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thin, leathery, dark green, smooth or\r\n    sometimes rugose; lower surface grayish-green, not pubescent,\r\n    with a prominent midrib; apex acuminate; margin finely serrate,\r\n    tipped with fine, reddish-brown glands; petiole one-fourth inch\r\n    long, with one to six reniform, greenish-yellow glands variable\r\n    in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds large, long, conical, heavily pubescent, appressed;\r\n    season of bloom early; flowers pink, one and one-half\r\n    inches across, often in pairs; pedicels short, glabrous,\r\n    green; calyx-tube dull reddish-green, light yellow within,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, narrow, acute to\r\n    obtuse, glabrous within, heavily pubescent without; petals\r\n    round-ovate, bluntly notched near the base, tapering to long,\r\n    narrow claws occasionally with a reddish base; filaments\r\n    one-half inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent\r\n    at the ovary, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures early; two and three-eighths inches long, two and\r\n    one-fourth inches wide, round-oval, compressed, with unequal\r\n    halves; cavity shallow, contracted, irregular, abrupt; suture\r\n    medium to shallow; apex roundish, somewhat mucronate; color\r\n    creamy-white, blushed with red; pubescence short, heavy;\r\n    skin thick but tender, adherent to the pulp; flesh white,\r\n    translucent, veined, juicy, melting, sweet or mildly sprightly;\r\n    good in quality; stone nearly free, one and five-sixteenths\r\n    inches long, one inch wide, oval, plump, bulged on one side,\r\n    light colored, short-pointed at the apex, with grooved\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture very deeply grooved along the sides,\r\n    narrow, winged; dorsal suture grooved, more or less winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCHESTER\r\n\r\n    =414=:6, 7, Pl. 1916. =3.= _N. Y. State Fr. Gr. Assoc. Rpt._\r\n    18. 1916.\r\n\r\nFruit-growers have long desired an early, yellow, freestone peach with\r\nsuitable tree-characters for a commercial plantation. There are several\r\ncompetitors for the place, the latest of which is Rochester, a member\r\nof the Crawford group and in several respects a marked improvement\r\non the well-known Early Crawford. Rochester, in season, regarding\r\nthe crop as a whole, certainly precedes Early Crawford several days,\r\nripening soon after the middle of August. The introducers say that it\r\nis two weeks earlier, a statement made possible by the fact that its\r\nseason is very long, a few specimens ripening extremely early. The\r\ngreat length of season of this variety under some circumstances may\r\nbe an asset, under others a liability. As the color-plate shows, the\r\npeaches are large, yellow, with a handsome over-color of mottled red,\r\nmore rotund than either of the two Crawfords or Elberta, making, all\r\nin all, a strikingly beautiful peach. The flesh, too, meets all the\r\nrequirements of a good peach--thick and firm, marbled yellow, stained\r\nwith red at the pit, juicy, rich, sweet and in all respects fully up\r\nto the high standard of palatability found in peaches of the Crawford\r\ngroup. While the variety must be classed as a freestone, yet there is\r\na slight clinging which may disappear under some conditions and may be\r\naugmented under others. Rochester seems to be sufficiently productive\r\nfor a good commercial fruit but it remains to be seen how generally it\r\nis adapted to soils and climates. Should its range of adaptability be\r\ngreat, Rochester, by virtue of earliness, good quality and handsome\r\nappearance, at once takes a high place in commercial peach-growing in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nRochester came from a seed planted about 1900 on a farm owned by a Mr.\r\nWallen, near Rochester, New York.

Even with these handicaps, to which may be added small size\r\nin many situations, St. John has maintained great popularity for home\r\norchards and in many peach-regions is grown for the markets. It is one\r\nof the earliest of the Crawford-like peaches, a perfect freestone,\r\nhandsome in appearance, sweet, rich and delicious in flavor and\r\npleasing in all of the flesh attributes of a good dessert peach. St.\r\nJohn resembles Early Crawford in size and shape but is a little more\r\nrotund, runs somewhat smaller, is not quite as high in quality and\r\nripens several days earlier. The trees are all that could be asked for\r\nin size, vigor and hardiness, falling short only in the characters\r\nnoted in the opening sentence. St. John should always be planted in the\r\nhome orchard and it would seem that it is more often worth planting in\r\ncommercial orchards. The color-plate does not do the variety justice\r\nin size, color or shape, the Station grounds being one of the many\r\nplaces in which the variety cannot be had at its best.\r\n\r\nWhere, by whom and when St. John originated and what its parentage,\r\nare unknown. It is more than half a century old, came from the South,\r\nand has been widely planted in southern peach-districts, especially\r\nalong the southern coast of Alabama. The variety reproduces itself from\r\nseed and this fact has led to its being distributed under a number of\r\ndifferent names as is shown by the synonyms listed in the references.\r\nIn Michigan the variety was grown for some time as Crane, or Crane's\r\nEarly Yellow, having come from the orchard of Charles G. Crane of\r\nFennville. Mr. Crane, it appears, had lost the true name of the peach\r\nand after fruiting his supposed seedling for a time it was discovered\r\nby T. T. Lyon[265] to be identical with St. John. In 1871 the American\r\nPomological Society added this peach to its fruit-list as Yellow St.\r\nJohn but dropped \"Yellow\" from the name in 1891, the variety having\r\nappeared since that time in the Society's catalog as St. John.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST.

Both find their greatest\r\nusefulness in extending the peach-season, this variety being one of the\r\nlatest and Rivers one of the earliest sorts. It is a yellow-fleshed,\r\nfreestone peach of attractive appearance and of good quality, neither\r\nhandsome enough nor good enough in quality, however, to be considered\r\na first-class dessert fruit. On the other hand it is one of the best\r\nsorts for canning, preserving and evaporating. The trees are vigorous,\r\nhardy, healthy and very productive but unfortunately ripen their crop\r\nso late in New York that the variety cannot be depended upon. Early\r\nfreezes often destroy the fruit and cold, wet weather usually hinders\r\nmaturity so much that the peaches are seldom at their best in this\r\nState. Possibly no other peach is more widely grown than Salwey. It is\r\na standard sort in France, England and in peach-regions in America from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific and from Canada to the Gulf. This uncommon\r\nadaptability to diverse soils and climates ought to make it a valuable\r\nsort in peach-breeding. It has the reputation of coming true to seed\r\nbut we do not find that many varieties have come from it.\r\n\r\nThe history of Salwey is not clear. Pomologists generally credit\r\nThomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England, with being the originator and\r\nintroducer of the variety. It is known that Rivers grew it on his\r\ngrounds but it is doubtful if he originated it. Other accounts say that\r\nit was raised in 1844 by Colonel Salwey, Egham Park, Surrey, England,\r\nfrom the seed of an Italian peach. Some say that a Charles Turner,\r\nSlough, England, brought the Italian peach seed from Florence, Italy,\r\nwhile others state that Turner introduced the new peach. The variety\r\nhas long been known in America as Salway but Colonel Salwey, after whom\r\nthe peach was named, spelled his name with an \"e\" and the correction is\r\nmade in this text. In 1875 the American Pomological Society added this\r\npeach to its list of recommended fruits under the name Salway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALWEY]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright-spreading, becoming\r\n    drooping, dense-topped, hardy, very productive; trunk thick,\r\n    smooth; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown mingled with\r\n    very light ash-gray; branchlets slender, very long, with a\r\n    tendency to rebranch near the tips; internodes dull pinkish-red\r\n    with but little if any green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves seven inches long, one and three-fourths inches wide,\r\n    folded upward and recurled, oval to ovate-lanceolate, leathery;\r\n    apex acuminate; upper surface dark, dull green, smooth,\r\n    becoming rugose near the midrib; margin finely serrate, tipped\r\n    with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    glandless or with one to six small, globose and reniform glands\r\n    variable in color and position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, conical or pointed, pubescent, appressed\r\n    or partly free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers\r\n    seven-eighths inch across, white at the center of the petals,\r\n    becoming pink near the margins; pedicels very short, nearly\r\n    sessile, thick; calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-colored\r\n    within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, narrow,\r\n    acute, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals round,\r\n    broadly oval, widely notched near the base, tapering to long,\r\n    narrow claws red at the base; filaments five-sixteenths inch\r\n    long, equal to the petals in length; pistil pubescent, longer\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; two and nine-sixteenths inches long,\r\n    two and one-half inches wide, round-cordate, bulged near the\r\n    apex, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity deep, abrupt,\r\n    often splashed with red; suture shallow, often extending\r\n    beyond the tip; apex usually a small, elongated point; color\r\n    greenish-yellow, usually with a brownish-red blush splashed\r\n    dark red; pubescence short, thick, fine; skin thin, tough,\r\n    adherent to the pulp; flesh golden-yellow, faintly tinged with\r\n    red near the pit, juicy, stringy, tender, becomes dry with\r\n    age, sweet, pleasantly flavored, aromatic; good to very good\r\n    in quality; stone free, one and one-half inches long, one and\r\n    one-sixteenth inches wide, oval to roundish-oval, very plump,\r\n    pointed at the base, with large pits and short grooves in the\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture narrow, deeply furrowed along the\r\n    edges; dorsal suture winged, a narrow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUMAKER\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

There are other peaches as early but, on the\r\nStation grounds, this is the best flavored of the early peaches.\r\nMoreover, when fully ripe it is almost a freestone. It is a handsome\r\npeach in color and shape but the fruits are too small though this can\r\nbe remedied in part by thinning. The trees are large, hardy, vigorous\r\nand productive to a fault. With all of these good qualities, the wonder\r\nis that Schumaker is not more popular as a commercial variety to open\r\nthe season but for some reason peach-growers are not pleased with\r\nit--probably because of the small size of the peaches. For a peach of\r\nits season, Schumaker is remarkably free from brown-rot. Nurserymen\r\noften substitute Alexander for this variety and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis variety originated as a seedling with Michael Schumaker, Fairview,\r\nErie County, Pennsylvania. Its parentage is unknown. It fruited for the\r\nfirst time in 1877 and was for a few years grown commercially but its\r\npopularity has long been on the wane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHUMAKER]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, becoming drooping,\r\n    open-topped, productive; trunk thick, smooth; branches stocky,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown tinged with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    long, pinkish-red with but a trace of green, glossy, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with large, conspicuous, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-half inches long, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, variable in position, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dull, dark green, smooth; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole seven-sixteenths inch long, glandless or with\r\n    one to four small, globose, reddish-brown glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, pubescent, conical or pointed, plump,\r\n    usually free; blossoms appear early; flowers one and one-half\r\n    inches across, pink; pedicels very short, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green at the base, greenish-yellow within,\r\n    obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, acute, glabrous within,\r\n    pubescent without; petals oval to ovate, tapering to claws\r\n    sometimes red at the base; filaments one-half inch long,\r\n    shorter than the petals; pistil pubescent at the base, as long\r\n    as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very early; about two and one-eighth inches in\r\n    diameter, round, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity deep,\r\n    flaring; suture shallow; apex ending in a recurved, mucronate\r\n    tip but variable; color creamy-white, heavily blushed and often\r\n    mottled with dark red; pubescence short, thick; skin thin,\r\n    tender, separates from the pulp when fully ripe; flesh white,\r\n    very juicy, stringy, tender, sweet, aromatic, highly flavored;\r\n    very good in quality; stone clinging, becoming semi-cling when\r\n    fully mature, one and one-fourth inches long, three-fourths\r\n    inch wide, oval, plump, inconspicuously winged, with corrugated\r\n    surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOCK\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

The variety\r\nhas so little to recommend it, however, that we cannot but believe that\r\nreputation more than merit kept up its popularity. The trees are about\r\nall that could be desired but the peaches are of but mediocre quality\r\nand not at all attractive in appearance, lacking in size and color,\r\nare ungainly in shape and have but little uniformity in size, color or\r\nshape. It is one of the latest yellow-fleshed peaches and is said to be\r\nexcellent for all culinary purposes. With so many better varieties of\r\nlate yellow-fleshed, freestone peaches, Smock is not worth planting for\r\nany purpose.\r\n\r\nSmock originated three-quarters of a century or more ago with a\r\nMr. Smock, Middletown, New Jersey. Variations under such names as\r\nSmock X and Smock (Hance) have arisen as distinct varieties but all\r\nhave proved to be identical with the old sort. The name Smock Cling\r\nappears in peach-literature but whether the peach was distinct we\r\ncannot say. Years after the introduction of Smock a peach was put\r\nout under the name \"Beers Smock.\" The differences claimed are that\r\nBeers Smock runs larger and is better in quality than Smock. All\r\ndescriptions of the two sorts, however, are so nearly identical that\r\nwe believe that the two names are given to the same peach. In 1862 the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society listed Smock in its catalog as Smock\r\nFreestone. In 1873 the name was shortened to Smock and it so appears\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMOCK]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, somewhat drooping,\r\n    dense-topped, tall, usually very productive; trunk medium to\r\n    thick, rough; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown with very\r\n    light ash-gray tinge; branchlets slender, medium to long, with\r\n    short internodes, dark red intermingled with olive-green,\r\n    glossy, smooth, glabrous, with large, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, flattened or curved downward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thick; upper surface dull, dark green; smooth; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with dark red\r\n    glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, with none to five\r\n    small, globose or reniform glands variable in color and\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, conical or pointed, slightly pubescent,\r\n    appressed or free; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers less\r\n    than one inch across, white at the center of the petals, light\r\n    or dark pink near the edges, often in twos; pedicels short,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube reddish-green at the base,\r\n    orange-colored within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, acute, serrate, glabrous within, pubescent without,\r\n    partly reflexed; petals oval, irregular in outline near the\r\n    base, tapering to long, narrow claws often reddish at the base;\r\n    filaments three-eighths inch long, equal to the petals in\r\n    length; pistil pubescent near the base, equal to or longer than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very late; two and one-half inches long, two\r\n    and three-eighths inches wide, oval, irregular, often bulged\r\n    near the apex, compressed, with halves unequal and somewhat\r\n    angular; cavity narrow, abrupt, contracted around the sides,\r\n    twig-marked; suture a mere line, becoming deeper toward the\r\n    apex; apex roundish, with a recurved, mucronate tip; color\r\n    greenish-yellow or sometimes orange-yellow, specked and\r\n    mottled with dull, dark red or sometimes faintly tinted with a\r\n    bronze blush; pubescence very heavy, thick, fine; skin thin,\r\n    tough, adherent to the pulp; flesh yellow, faintly tinged with\r\n    red near the pit, variable in juiciness, tender, sprightly,\r\n    pleasantly flavored; good in quality; stone free, one and\r\n    five-eighths inches long, one and one-sixteenth inches wide,\r\n    oval or obovate, bulged near the apex, flattened toward the\r\n    base, with deeply grooved surfaces; ventral suture narrow,\r\n    winged, deeply grooved along the sides; dorsal suture a wide\r\n    and deep groove, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEVENS\r\n\r\n    =1.= Budd-Hansen _Am.

The variety is best\r\nknown as Stevens Rareripe but the last part of the name is inapt for\r\nthe true rareripes are earlier ripening peaches while with Stevens\r\nlateness is one of its prime assets. In quality the fruits are extra\r\ngood, the flesh-characters pleasing in every respect. The flavor is a\r\npleasing mingling of sweet and sour not found in many other peaches so\r\nlate in the season. The appearance of the peach is as alluring as the\r\ntaste. The color-plate shows the variety almost perfectly in color and\r\nshape but the peaches as depicted are rather smaller than the average.\r\nThese late, white-fleshed peaches now seldom sell well, usually\r\nreaching the markets in poor condition, but they are choice fruits for\r\nhome use and for this purpose Stevens should be planted in every home\r\norchard. The variety has the reputation of being hardy in both wood and\r\nbuds.\r\n\r\nStevens originated about 1858 on the farm of B. Stevens, Morristown,\r\nNew Jersey. Its parentage is unknown. It was listed in the American\r\nPomological Society's catalog in 1889 as Stevens Rareripe. Later the\r\nname was shortened to Stevens in accordance with the Society's rules of\r\nnomenclature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEVENS]\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright-spreading, with the lower branches\r\n    inclined to droop, productive; trunk of medium thickness,\r\n    rough; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown mingled with\r\n    light ash-gray; branchlets thick, dark reddish-brown with but\r\n    little green, glossy, smooth, with numerous large and small\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and five-eighths inches\r\n    wide, folded upward and slightly recurled, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dark green, glossy,\r\n    rugose along the midrib; lower surface light green; margin\r\n    finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to six small,\r\n    reniform glands usually at the base of the leaf; flower-buds\r\n    intermediate in size and length, conical to pointed, somewhat\r\n    appressed, pubescent; flowers small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; about two and eleven-sixteenths inches\r\n    in diameter, round to round-oval, with nearly equal sides;\r\n    cavity deep, wide, flaring to abrupt; suture medium to deep,\r\n    often extending beyond the tip; apex roundish, with a strongly\r\n    mucronate and recurved tip; color greenish-white overlaid\r\n    with attractive purplish-red, often mottled or splashed with\r\n    darker red; pubescence short, fine; skin thick, tough, adherent\r\n    to the pulp; flesh white, tinted with red near the pit and\r\n    reddish underneath the deepest surface blush, juicy, coarse,\r\n    sweet, sprightly; good in quality; stone nearly free, one and\r\n    five-eighths inches long, one and one-eighth inches wide,\r\n    obovate, flattened at the base, plump, with grooved surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture medium to deeply grooved along the edges,\r\n    intermediate in width, furrowed; dorsal suture deeply grooved,\r\n    winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUMP\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Tex.

It is not a handsome fruit, the color-plate\r\nflattering rather than detracting from its appearance, but makes\r\nup in quality what it lacks in looks. The flesh is melting, juicy,\r\nsparkling, rich and good though dry and very mediocre if permitted to\r\noverripen. The peaches are too tender for distant shipment and the\r\nvariety is of value only for local markets and home use. The trees\r\nare large, vigorous, hardy, healthy and productive, with a shapely,\r\nupright-spreading, dense-topped head--about all that could be desired\r\nin a peach-tree. In spite of the high quality of the peaches and the\r\nsplendid tree-characters, Stump is steadily waning in popularity and\r\nwill, no doubt, soon pass from cultivation.\r\n\r\nWe can say little of the history of Stump other than that it originated\r\nin New Jersey at least three-quarters of a century ago. A Mr. Brant,\r\nMadison, New Jersey, in a report on peaches at the meeting of the\r\nNew Jersey Horticultural Society in 1878 mentions a variety as\r\nStump-of-the-World which originated on the farm of Samuel Whitehead\r\nin Middlesex County, New Jersey, about 1825. Mr. Brant, however,\r\nconsidered this sort distinct from Stump although very similar to it.\r\nFrom the description he gives it seems certain that he was describing\r\nthe true Stump. In 1862 the American Pomological Society listed this\r\nsort in its catalog as Stump the World. The name was shortened to Stump\r\nin 1897 by the committee on nomenclature in accordance with pomological\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STUMP]\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    productive; trunk medium in diameter, smooth; branches stocky,\r\n    smooth, reddish-brown tinged with light ash-gray; branchlets\r\n    thick, inclined to rebranch, long, with internodes dark red\r\n    mingled with olive-green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with many\r\n    conspicuous, small, raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, folded downward, broad-oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dull, dark green, rugose along the\r\n    midrib; lower surface grayish-green; margin finely serrate,\r\n    often in two series, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long, with one to four globose glands\r\n    variable in color and position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds semi-hardy, pubescent, conical to pointed, plump,\r\n    usually more or less free; blossoms appear in mid-season;\r\n    flowers thirteen-sixteenths inch across, white at the center,\r\n    becoming pink near the margin; pedicels long, slender;\r\n    calyx-tube dull reddish-green, yellow within, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes acute, obtuse, glabrous within, pubescent\r\n    without; petals oval, faintly notched near the base, tapering\r\n    to very short claws tinged with red near the base; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long, equal to the petals in length;\r\n    pistil pubescent at the ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; about two and one-half inches in diameter,\r\n    round-oval to cordate bulged near the apex, compressed, with\r\n    markedly unequal halves; cavity shallow, wide, uneven in\r\n    outline, flaring or abrupt, with tender skin; suture shallow,\r\n    often extending beyond the tip; apex round or pointed, with a\r\n    recurved, mucronate tip; color creamy-white, blushed, mottled\r\n    and splashed with red; pubescence long, thick, coarse; skin\r\n    thin, tough, separates from the pulp; flesh white, strongly\r\n    stained with red near the pit, juicy, tender and melting,\r\n    sweet, rich, pleasantly flavored, aromatic; very good in\r\n    quality; stone nearly free, one and one-half inches long, one\r\n    and one-sixteenth inches wide, ovate to oval, plump, flattened\r\n    toward the base, tapering to a long point, with grooved\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture deeply marked along the edges, narrow,\r\n    sometimes winged; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER SNOW\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Okla.

The quality is poor and the flesh clings to\r\nthe pit so tenaciously that the variety has no value, whatsoever, for\r\ndessert but is said to be excellent for pickling and to make a very\r\ngood and a very distinctive canned product.\r\n\r\nThere are no records of the origin of this peach but it is doubtful if\r\nit dates back more than a quarter of a century. The variety is very\r\nsimilar to the old Snow, which was probably its prototype, differing\r\nessentially in having a clinging stone while the stone of Snow is free.\r\nIn New York the name is a misnomer as the fruit does not ripen until\r\nthe last of September or early in October. Albino peaches date back to\r\nthe early records of this fruit and seem to be known wherever peaches\r\nare grown. Whenever seedling peaches are grown in large numbers, an\r\noccasional albino appears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUMMER SNOW]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, slightly drooping,\r\n    productive; trunk thick and, smooth; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown mingled with very light ash-gray; branchlets very\r\n    long, inclined to rebranch, with internodes of medium length,\r\n    olive-green intermingled with light brown, smooth, glabrous,\r\n    with conspicuous, russet-colored lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, flattened or curved downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, thin; upper surface dull green, smooth;\r\n    lower surface grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped\r\n    with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    glandless or with one to six small, globose and reniform glands\r\n    variable in color and position.\r\n\r\n    Leaf-buds semi-hardy, small, short, variable in shape, plump,\r\n    appressed or slightly free; blossoms appear in mid-season;\r\n    flowers one and five-eighths inches across, white, sometimes in\r\n    twos; pedicels short, thick, glabrous, green; calyx-tube tinged\r\n    with green, yellow within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    variable in length, medium to narrow, acute, glabrous\r\n    within, pubescent without; petals often pointed at the apex,\r\n    round-ovate, broadly notched at the base, tapering to broad,\r\n    short claws; filaments seven-sixteenths inch long, shorter than\r\n    the petals; pistil pubescent near the base, as long as the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures late; two and three-eighths inches long, two and\r\n    five-sixteenths inches wide, round-cordate, somewhat angular,\r\n    bulged at one side, compressed, with unequal sides; cavity\r\n    deep, narrow, abrupt, contracted about the sides, twig-marked;\r\n    suture shallow, becoming deeper toward the tip; apex roundish\r\n    or depressed, with a mucronate or sometimes a small, mamelon\r\n    tip; color greenish-white changing to creamy-white, without\r\n    blush; pubescence long, thick, coarse; skin thin, tender,\r\n    adherent to the pulp; flesh white to the pit, juicy, meaty,\r\n    mildly sweet to sprightly; fair in quality; stone firmly\r\n    clinging, one and nine-sixteenths inches long, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, broad-oval, often bulged near the apex,\r\n    winged, with pitted surfaces marked with short grooves; ventral\r\n    suture rather narrow, winged, with furrows of medium depth\r\n    along the sides; dorsal suture grooved, with winged sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURPASSE\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

The fruits are large,\r\nhandsome and of excellent quality, while the trees are satisfactory in\r\nevery respect except, possibly, in productiveness. The variety has been\r\ngrown sufficiently long in New York to have been well tested and has\r\nnot found favor, so that we must conclude that it does not do as well\r\nelsewhere as here and that it is doomed to go into the discard.\r\n\r\nSurpasse originated more than forty years ago on the grounds of\r\nEllwanger & Barry, Rochester, New York, and has long been sold by this\r\nnursery firm. It has never been widely nor largely grown commercially\r\nbut is not uncommon in western New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURPASSE]\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium size, vigorous, upright-spreading, with a\r\n    tendency to droop, rather unproductive; trunk thick and smooth;\r\n    branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown mingled with light\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets thick, inclined to rebranch, long, dark\r\n    pinkish-red with some green, smooth except for the lenticels,\r\n    glabrous, with very conspicuous, numerous, large and small,\r\n    raised lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and five-eighths inches wide,\r\n    variable in position, oval to obovate-lanceolate, leathery;\r\n    upper surface dark olive-green, rugose along the midrib; apex\r\n    acuminate; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole seven-sixteenths inch long, glandless or\r\n    with one to four small, globose glands variable in color and\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, pubescent, conical to pointed, plump,\r\n    usually free; blossoms open in mid-season; flowers\r\n    seven-eighths inch across, light pink but darker along the\r\n    edges, usually single; pedicels short, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green, orange-colored within, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes long, narrow, acute, glabrous within,\r\n    pubescent without; petals ovate, with short, indistinct claws;\r\n    filaments three-eighths inch long, equal to the petals in\r\n    length; pistil as long as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-half inches long,\r\n    two and three-eighths inches wide, round-cordate, irregular,\r\n    compressed, much bulged near the apex, with unequal halves;\r\n    cavity deep, wide, flaring to abrupt, with tender, reddish\r\n    skin; suture a line becoming deeper toward the tip; apex\r\n    pointed, usually with an erect, mamelon tip; color pale yellow\r\n    or orange-yellow, mottled and splashed more or less with red\r\n    and overspread with a lively, dark red blush; pubescence\r\n    medium in length, thick, fine; skin thin, separates from\r\n    the pulp; flesh light yellow, red near the pit, very juicy,\r\n    rather coarse, stringy, tender and melting, sprightly, highly\r\n    flavored; good to very good in quality; stone free, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches long, fifteen-sixteenths inch wide, ovate,\r\n    rather plump, tapering to a long point, sometimes slightly\r\n    winged along the ventral suture, with pitted surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture deeply grooved along the edges, below medium in width,\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture grooved, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURBER\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

In the South, however, it seems\r\nto be considered one of the best of its class not only in quality\r\nbut in size and appearance. The fruits are small in New York, as the\r\ncolor-plate shows, while all descriptions of them in the South say they\r\nare large. The variety is possibly worth planting, because of good\r\nquality, in home orchards in this State.\r\n\r\nThurber is a seedling of Chinese Cling grown by L. E. Berckmans, Rome,\r\nGeorgia, more than forty years ago. The variety was named in honor of\r\nDr. George Thurber, American botanist, naturalist and editor. It is\r\nsimilar to its parent but is a freestone and the trees are more compact\r\nand thrifty than those of Chinese Cling. The American Pomological\r\nSociety added Thurber to its fruit-list in 1881, a place it still holds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THURBER]\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium size, vigorous, upright-spreading,\r\n    productive; trunk thick and smooth; branches stocky, smooth,\r\n    reddish-brown mingled with light ash-gray; branchlets slender,\r\n    often very long, olive-green with some red, glossy, smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous conspicuous, raised lenticels variable\r\n    in size, usually russetted toward the base.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, over one and one-half inches wide,\r\n    flattened or curled downward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dull, dark green, smooth becoming\r\n    rugose along the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; margin\r\n    finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to four small,\r\n    globose glands variable in color and position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds tender, large, medium to short, heavily pubescent,\r\n    obtuse, very plump, usually free; blossoms open in mid-season;\r\n    flowers one and one-eighth inches across, light pink, darker\r\n    along the edges, usually single; pedicels long, slender,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube reddish-green, greenish-yellow\r\n    within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes acute, glabrous\r\n    within, heavily pubescent without, flattened; petals ovate,\r\n    tapering to short, narrow claws; filaments seven-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, equal to the petals in length; pistil longer than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and three-eighths inches\r\n    long, two and one-eighth inches wide, round-oval, somewhat\r\n    compressed, with unequal halves; cavity shallow, narrow,\r\n    flaring or abrupt, often tinted with red, compressed about the\r\n    sides; suture a line or very shallow, often extending beyond\r\n    the tip; apex round, with a recurved, mucronate or mamelon tip;\r\n    color green or creamy-white, with few splashes of dull red over\r\n    a lively red blush; pubescence long, coarse, thick; skin thin,\r\n    tough, variable in adherence to the pulp; flesh white, deeply\r\n    stained with red near the pit, juicy, tender and melting,\r\n    pleasantly sprightly, aromatic; good in quality; stone free,\r\n    one and one-half inches long, more than an inch wide, red,\r\n    obovate to oval, flattened toward the base, plump, tapering\r\n    to a short point, often winged on the ventral suture, with\r\n    surfaces pitted and marked by short grooves; ventral suture\r\n    deeply grooved along the edges, narrow; dorsal suture grooved,\r\n    slightly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIANA\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Tex.

It can be grown, however, with about\r\nas much certainty in New York as many of the standard varieties of\r\nthe North. Its small size and poor shipping qualities debar it from\r\ncompeting with commercial peaches in this region but it is well worth\r\nplanting in home orchards for the sake of variety and because of\r\nits delicious flavor--a sort of scented sweetness wholly unknown in\r\nnorthern varieties. The good health, vigor, size and hardiness of these\r\nhoney-peaches on the Station grounds is a constant surprise to those\r\nwho have believed that they could be grown only in the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nTriana originated a quarter of a century or more ago at the Glen Saint\r\nMary Nurseries, Glen Saint Mary, Florida. It was introduced in 1892 by\r\nthe originators.

It is grown more or less, however, both north and south\r\nbecause it is one of the earliest yellow-fleshed sorts and because\r\nthe trees bear regularly and abundantly. The dark color and the great\r\namount of fuzzy pubescence detract materially from the appearance of\r\nthe peach. The specimens shown in the color-plate are from unthinned\r\ntrees; the size can be increased by thinning. Small pits somewhat\r\noffset the small size of the fruits. The peaches, if not attacked\r\nby brown-rot, stand shipment splendidly, a character which adds to its\r\nvalue for early markets. Though often put down as a clingstone it is,\r\nwhen well grown, a semi-cling and sometimes the stone is free.\r\n\r\nTriumph is one of several seedlings grown by J. D. Husted, Vineyard,\r\nGeorgia. It is supposed to be an offspring of Alexander. The date of\r\norigin is unknown but references go back to 1895.

It is still listed in a few nursery\r\ncatalogs and is still on the fruit-list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety. Among the multitude of early peaches now grown, Troth cuts\r\nbut a sorry figure in either tree- or fruit-characters. It is worth\r\ndiscussing here only because it is a milestone in the evolution of\r\ncultivated peaches.\r\n\r\nTroth, first known as Troth's Early Red, originated in the first years\r\nof the Nineteenth Century, probably in New Jersey. Nothing is known of\r\nits parentage or of the originator. It ripens with Early York and some\r\npomologists have confused it with this variety and also with Haines\r\nbut, while similar to both, Troth is distinct. The American Pomological\r\nSociety placed the variety upon its fruit-list in 1862 under the name\r\nTroth's Early Red but dropped it in 1891. In 1899 it was once more\r\nrecommended by the Pomological Society, being listed as Troth.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, the\r\n    lower branches drooping, very productive; trunk somewhat\r\n    stocky; branches thick, smooth, reddish-brown covered\r\n    with light ash-gray; branchlets slender, long, with short\r\n    internodes, dark pinkish-red intermingled with green, with\r\n    conspicuous, very numerous, large and small lenticels;\r\n    leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, flattened and slightly curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery, dark, dull green, smooth becoming\r\n    rugose near the midrib; margin finely and shallowly serrate,\r\n    tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole seven-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, with one to five very small, globose, reddish-brown\r\n    glands; flower-buds half-hardy, of medium size and length, more\r\n    or less pubescent, obtuse or conical, plump, usually appressed;\r\n    blossoms small, appear in mid-season.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two inches long, two and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, roundish-oblate, slightly bulged at\r\n    one side, somewhat compressed, with halves decidedly unequal;\r\n    cavity of medium depth and width, abrupt, somewhat irregular,\r\n    contracted about the sides, often dotted and striped with\r\n    red; suture rather shallow, extending considerably beyond the\r\n    point; apex roundish or depressed, with a mucronate or slightly\r\n    pointed tip; color greenish-white or creamy-white, blushed with\r\n    dark, dull red and with more or less heavy mottlings extending\r\n    over more than half of the surface; pubescence thick, short;\r\n    skin thin, tender, adheres somewhat to the pulp; flesh whitish,\r\n    tinged with red near the pit, variable in juiciness, tender,\r\n    nearly melting, pleasant flavored; fair to good in quality;\r\n    stone free, one and one-eighths inches long, seven-eighths inch\r\n    wide, oval, flattened toward the base, acute at the apex, with\r\n    grooved surfaces; ventral suture medium in width; dorsal suture\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWADDELL\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

The variety is\r\nnow widely grown and is everywhere esteemed as a commercial sort. Its\r\nchief competitor is Carman, compared with which the fruit differs in\r\nripening a few days early; is handsomer, in color at least, the two,\r\nas the color-plates show, being very similar in size and shape; is of\r\nrather finer texture of flesh and is better flavored; and, lastly,\r\naccording to most reports, Waddell is a better shipper than Carman.\r\nThe variety has not been nearly as widely nor as generally planted as\r\nthe better-known Carman but we are of the opinion that it has been a\r\ngreater factor in the success of a score or more of the big commercial\r\npeach-orchards, North and South, of the last few years. It is a\r\nparticularly pleasing peach in New York and ought to be considered for\r\nevery commercial plantation where a variety of its season is wanted to\r\nprecede or to compete with Carman.\r\n\r\nWaddell is a chance seedling found by William Waddell, Griffin,\r\nGeorgia. The variety was introduced by J. H. Hale, South Glastonbury,\r\nConnecticut. The American Pomological Society added Waddell to its\r\nfruit-list in 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WADDELL]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright becoming spreading and\r\n    with the lower branches inclined to droop, hardy, productive;\r\n    trunk thick, smooth; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown\r\n    tinged with light ash-gray; branchlets long, inclined to\r\n    rebranch, dark pinkish-red overspread with green, glossy,\r\n    smooth, glabrous, with numerous conspicuous, raised lenticels\r\n    variable in size.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six inches long, one and three-fourths inches wide,\r\n    folded upward and curled downward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dull, dark green, smooth; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; apex acuminate; margin finely serrate, tipped\r\n    with reddish-brown glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    with one to four small, globose, reddish-brown glands variable\r\n    in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds hardy, conical or pointed, pubescent, usually\r\n    appressed; blossoms appear in mid-season; flowers one and\r\n    three-fourths inches across, red becoming pale pink, in\r\n    clusters of twos; pedicels short, slender, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube reddish-green at the base, greenish-yellow within,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, glabrous\r\n    within, pubescent without; petals oval, crenate, irregular in\r\n    outline near the base, tapering to claws with reddish base;\r\n    filaments seven-sixteenths inch long, shorter than the petals;\r\n    pistil pubescent near the base, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in early mid-season; two and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, about two inches wide, oval to roundish-oval, compressed,\r\n    bulged on one side, with unequal halves; cavity deep, abrupt,\r\n    with tender skin, tinged with pink; suture shallow, deepening\r\n    toward the apex and extending beyond; apex roundish, with a\r\n    small, mucronate tip; color creamy-white, blushed with red\r\n    and with a few dull splashes of darker red; pubescence thick;\r\n    skin tough, separates from the pulp; flesh white, stained with\r\n    pink near the pit, juicy, stringy firm but tender, sweet but\r\n    sprightly, aromatic; very good in quality; stone semi-free to\r\n    free, one and three-eighths inches long, one inch wide, ovate;\r\n    ventral suture deeply grooved along the sides, faintly winged;\r\n    dorsal suture grooved, not winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAGER\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cult. & Count.

It is a yellow-fleshed, freestone peach none too attractive\r\nin coloring, always rather small and of only fair quality as a dessert\r\nfruit but excellent for canning, drying and all culinary purposes. The\r\nvariety comes true to seed, or nearly so. The fruits of Wager are not\r\nattractive enough and the trees are too small to make the variety of\r\nmuch value in commercial plantations but it is a very good peach for\r\nhome orchards and one of the best of all where hardiness is a prime\r\nrequisite. Several quite distinct peaches are sold by nurserymen as\r\nWager.\r\n\r\nWager originated some time previous to 1870 with Benjamin Wager, West\r\nBloomfield, Ontario County, New York. The variety was added to the\r\nfruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAGER]\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size or small, upright-spreading, hardy,\r\n    productive; trunk intermediate in thickness and smoothness;\r\n    branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown overlaid with light\r\n    ash-gray; branchlets rebranching near the tips, dark red with\r\n    some green, roughened by the lenticels, which are medium in\r\n    size and number.\r\n\r\n    Leaves five and one-half inches long, one and one-fourth inches\r\n    wide, flattened or curled downward, oval to obovate-lanceolate,\r\n    thin, leathery; upper surface dull, dark green, rugose along\r\n    the midrib; lower surface grayish-green; apex acuminate; margin\r\n    finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long, with two to four small, globose or\r\n    reniform glands variable in color and position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds medium in size and length, heavily pubescent,\r\n    conical, plump, usually free; blossoms appear in mid-season;\r\n    flowers one and one-eighth inches across; pedicels very\r\n    short, thick, glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green,\r\n    orange-colored within, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    narrow, acute, glabrous within, pubescent without; petals oval,\r\n    broadly notched, tapering to claws red at the base; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long, shorter than the petals; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-half inches long,\r\n    two and one-fourth inches wide, oval, bulged near the apex,\r\n    sometimes conical, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity\r\n    flaring or abrupt, often mottled with red and with tender skin;\r\n    suture a line, becoming deeper toward the tip; apex roundish\r\n    or pointed, usually with a mamelon, recurved tip; color\r\n    orange-yellow, blushed and mottled with dark red; pubescence\r\n    thick, long and fine; skin thin, tough, separates from the\r\n    pulp; flesh yellow, faintly stained with red near the pit,\r\n    meaty but tender, sweet, mild; good in quality; stone free, one\r\n    and three-eighths inches long, one inch wide, ovate, flattened\r\n    near the base, with pitted surfaces, marked with few short\r\n    grooves; ventral suture deeply grooved along the sides, wide,\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture a wide, deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERLOO\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cult. & Count.

In spite of the fact that the variety originated within\r\nten miles of the Station grounds it is all but worthless here as it is\r\nin most parts of New York. Waterloo is an extra-early, white-fleshed,\r\nsemi-cling peach very similar to the better-known Canada. The faults\r\nthat condemn it are small size, poor quality, susceptibility to\r\nbrown-rot and a long period of ripening for the fruit and small\r\nsize and unproductiveness in the tree. It is given prominence in\r\n_The Peaches of New York_ only because it is so often noted in the\r\nhorticultural press as a standard variety, an opinion, no doubt,\r\nreflected in America from European publications.\r\n\r\nWaterloo was first grown by Henry Lisk, Waterloo, Seneca County, New\r\nYork, who brought it to notice in 1877. Thomas Rivers introduced\r\nit into England where it has long been grown and esteemed for its\r\nearliness and good quality. The American Pomological Society placed\r\nWaterloo in its fruit-catalog in 1885, where it remained until 1891\r\nwhen it was dropped, but was replaced in 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERLOO]\r\n\r\n    Tree small, upright-spreading, sometimes productive; trunk\r\n    smooth; branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown covered with\r\n    light ash-gray; branchlets very long, rebranching, with\r\n    internodes of medium length, dark pinkish-red mingled with\r\n    green, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with few large lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and one-fourth inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, flattened, oval to obovate-lanceolate, leathery;\r\n    upper surface dull, dark olive-green, smooth; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green; margin finely serrate, tipped with reddish-brown\r\n    glands; petiole seven-sixteenths inch long, glandless or with\r\n    one to four small, globose and reniform, reddish-brown glands\r\n    variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds half-hardy, obtuse or conical, plump, usually free,\r\n    pubescent; flowers appear in mid-season; blossoms one and\r\n    one-half inches across, light pink, usually single; pedicels\r\n    very short, thick, green; calyx-tube lemon-yellow within,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, obtuse, glabrous\r\n    within, pubescent without; petals ovate, tapering to claws with\r\n    reddish base; filaments one-half inch long, shorter than the\r\n    petals; pistil equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures very early; nearly two inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish, with equal halves; cavity deep, wide flaring; suture\r\n    shallow; apex depressed, with a recurved, mamelon tip; color\r\n    creamy-white, blushed and mottled with red; pubescence short,\r\n    thick; skin thin, adherent to the pulp; flesh greenish-white,\r\n    juicy, stringy, tender and melting, sweet, mild, fair to good\r\n    in quality; stone semi-clinging, one and one-sixteenth inches\r\n    long, three-fourths inch wide, oval, plump, acutely pointed at\r\n    the apex, with pitted surfaces; dorsal suture slightly winging.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEATLAND\r\n\r\n    =1.= Thomas _Am.

Although the variety\r\noriginated in this State it is little grown here now, being somewhat\r\nmore popular westward in Michigan and very much grown in Colorado and\r\nUtah. The fruit is about all that could be desired in New York but the\r\ntrees are so unproductive that the variety is nowhere grown in this\r\nregion with profit. The beauty and high quality of the fruit might make\r\nit desirable for home orchards.\r\n\r\nWheatland is a chance seedling found about 1870 on the grounds of\r\nDaniel E.

Even now in fruit- and tree-characters, with\r\nthe single exception of productiveness, Yellow Rareripe holds its own\r\nvery well with the peaches of its type and season. A glance at the\r\ncolor-plate shows the peach to be as attractive as any in color and\r\nshape; the size is above the average and in texture and flavor it is\r\nnot often surpassed. Its fault is unproductiveness, to make up for\r\nwhich the trees usually bear regularly and come in bearing early. The\r\nvariety is now hardly worth planting commercially in New York, being\r\nequalled by several yellow-fleshed peaches in all characters and\r\nsurpassed in productiveness by many, but, if the trees can be obtained,\r\nit might find a welcome place in home orchards. Yellow Rareripe seems\r\nstill to have all of the vigor and vitality of the first trees, helping\r\nthereby to furnish evidence that varieties do not run out.\r\n\r\nThis is another American peach the origin of which is involved in so\r\nmuch uncertainty that it is impossible to state where, when and by\r\nwhom produced. Prince claims to have discovered the original Yellow\r\nRareripe tree near Flushing, New York, over a hundred years ago. It was\r\nbeing grown in the vicinity of Boston early in the Nineteenth Century\r\nwhere it seems to have been first introduced by William Kenrick,\r\nNewton, Massachusetts, under the name Yellow Red Rareripe. Occasionally\r\nanother and inferior peach, Yellow Melocoton, was substituted for\r\nYellow Rareripe. Hovey received peach-trees from Kenrick under the\r\nname Cutter's Yellow which later proved to be Yellow Rareripe. Hovey\r\nretained the name Cutter's Yellow, because it was briefer. The Marie\r\nAntoinette, mentioned by Kenrick in 1841, is without question Yellow\r\nRareripe and has been listed as synonymous by several authors. Yellow\r\nRareripe was placed in the American Pomological Society's fruit-catalog\r\nin 1862 where it has since remained as a recommended variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW RARERIPE]\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, rather unproductive;\r\n    trunk stocky; branches thick, smooth, reddish-brown mingled\r\n    with light ash-gray; branchlets with internodes of medium\r\n    length, dark pinkish-red tinged with pale green, glossy,\r\n    smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous, numerous, large, raised\r\n    lenticels.\r\n\r\n    Leaves six and three-fourths inches long, one and three-fourths\r\n    inches wide, folded upward and curled downward, oval to\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, leathery; upper surface dull, dark\r\n    olive-green, smooth becoming rugose near the midrib; lower\r\n    surface grayish-green; margin finely serrate and sometimes\r\n    in two series, tipped with reddish-brown glands; petiole\r\n    three-eighths inch long, glandless or with one to four small,\r\n    globose glands variable in color and position.\r\n\r\n    Flower-buds conical or pointed, pubescent, plump, usually\r\n    appressed; blossoms open in mid-season; flowers seven-eighths\r\n    inch across, light pink but darker along the edges, usually\r\n    single; pedicels short, green; calyx-tube reddish-green,\r\n    orange-colored within, campanulate; calyx-lobes narrow, acute,\r\n    glabrous within, pubescent without; petals oval to ovate,\r\n    shallowly and widely notched towards the base, tapering to\r\n    claws red at the base; filaments three-eighths inch long, equal\r\n    to the petals in length; pistil as long as the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; two and one-fourth inches\r\n    long, two and three-sixteenths inches wide, round-conic\r\n    to round-cordate, compressed, with unequal halves; cavity\r\n    contracted and wrinkled about the sides, abrupt or flaring;\r\n    suture shallow; apex round or somewhat pointed, with a\r\n    mucronate or mamelon tip; color orange-yellow, with a deep\r\n    red blush, splashed and mottled with red; pubescence thick,\r\n    long, coarse; skin thin, tender, variable in adherence to\r\n    the pulp; flesh yellow, tinged with red near the pit, juicy,\r\n    fine-grained, tender and melting, sweet, pleasantly flavored;\r\n    good to very good in quality; stone free, one and one-fourth\r\n    inches long, seven-eighths inch wide, oval to ovate, bulged\r\n    near the apex, plump, tapering to a short point, with grooved\r\n    and pitted surfaces; ventral suture deeply grooved along the\r\n    edges, furrowed; dorsal suture grooved, winging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR VARIETIES OF PEACHES\r\n\r\n\r\n    =À Bec.= =1.= _Jour.

Probably from this variety have sprung the\r\nMelocotons and Yellow Rareripes of this country. Rossanna, though\r\nvery similar to Alberge, differs from it in having reniform glands\r\nand in ripening about two weeks later. In some sections, especially\r\naround Rochester, New York, Alberge is known as Barnard's Rareripe.\r\nThe variety was placed on the fruit-list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety in 1862 but was dropped in 1891. Tree moderate in growth;\r\nleaves crenate; glands globose; flowers small, rose-colored; fruit\r\nmedium in size, nearly globular; suture and cavity deep; skin yellow,\r\nalmost entirely covered with deep red or purple; flesh deep yellow, red\r\nnear the stone, melting, juicy, vinous; of second quality; pit large,\r\noval, terminating in a short point, brownish-red, free; ripens in the\r\nmiddle of August.\r\n\r\n    =Albert.= =1.= _Am.

According\r\nto Mas, it was raised by a M. Desse, Chantecoq, Seine, France, and\r\npassed for a long time under the name Desse Hâtive. Early Purple long\r\nfound favor in European orchards but is not much grown now, being\r\nsurpassed by better sorts. It was brought to America by William Prince,\r\nFlushing, New York, early in the Nineteenth Century and soon became\r\nconfused with Early York. The true variety, however, quickly passed\r\nfrom cultivation and the name has ever since been confused with that\r\nof Early York. Fruit medium to large, roundish, flattened at the base;\r\nsuture deep; color yellowish, blushed with dark red and dotted with red\r\non the shaded side; pubescence thick, fine; flesh white, stained red\r\nunder the skin on the side exposed to the sun, tinged with red next the\r\npit, juicy, vinous, highly flavored, melting; very good in quality;\r\nstone semi-free to free, brownish-red; ripens early.\r\n\r\n    =Early Rareripe I.= =1.= _Am.

The name Honey may have been applied to it in England. It\r\nreproduces itself closely from seed and a number of slight variations\r\nfrom the original type have been found in America. The strain chiefly\r\ngrown in this country was raised by Charles Downing from seed brought\r\nfrom China. Downing's seedlings failed but prior to their failure he\r\nhad sent grafts from them to Henry Lyons, Columbia, South Carolina,\r\nwho grew some trees. The variety was probably disseminated in America\r\nfrom this source. In 1889 the American Pomological Society added Honey\r\nto its list of fruits. Tree vigorous, hardy and productive in the\r\nSouth; glands usually reniform but sometimes globose; fruit small to\r\nmedium, oblong-oval, tapering at the apex into a long, sharp nipple or\r\nbeak, and marked with a distinct suture; color whitish-yellow, washed\r\nand dotted with red, which deepens to almost a crimson blush; flesh\r\ncreamy-white, streaked with red around the pit, juicy, very tender,\r\nmelting, sweet, with a distinct, rich, honey-like flavor; quality very\r\ngood; pit free; season in the South from the middle of June to the\r\nfirst of July.\r\n\r\n    =Honey Cling.= =1.= _Cal.

The fruit is larger and broader and ripens a week later\r\nthan the first and its serrate, glandless leaves serve to distinguish\r\nit from the latter. Because of its similarity to Royal George, it is\r\nsupposed to be an American seedling of that variety.

Pom._ 402. 1889.\r\n\r\nIt is very doubtful if the variety here described as Royal George is\r\nthe original variety. According to Hogg the first mention of Royal\r\nGeorge is by Switzer who said, in 1724, that it was raised by a Mr.\r\nOram, Brompton Lane, England. At this time George the First was on the\r\nthrone and, no doubt, the peach was named for him. The variety became\r\npopular but was difficult to propagate since it united with peach\r\nstocks very poorly. Hence, nurserymen substituted Millet's Mignonne, a\r\nnew sort at that time which had been introduced by a Mr. Millet, North\r\nEnd, Fulham, England. The original Royal George was probably a seedling\r\nof Grosse Mignonne and but little different from that variety in many\r\ncharacters. The long list of synonyms given Royal George by writers\r\nattests the length of time this name has been extant and the confusion\r\nsurrounding its identity. Flowers small; leaves serrate, without\r\nglands; fruit large, round, somewhat depressed, with a moderately deep\r\nsuture; skin very pale yellowish-white, sprinkled with many red dots\r\nand marbled with deep red; flesh pale yellowish-white, very red at the\r\nstone from which it separates, very juicy, melting, rich and highly\r\nflavored; usually ripens the first of September.\r\n\r\n    =Royal George Clingstone.= =1.= Prince _Pom.

Fruits_ 450-456. 1914.\r\n\r\n  \"_Trays for Drying._--The fruit is placed upon trays for exposure to\r\n  the sun. There is great variation in the size of the trays. The common\r\n  small tray is made of one-half inch sugar-pine lumber two feet wide and\r\n  three feet long, the boards forming it being held together by nailing\r\n  to a cleat on each end, one by one and a quarter inches, and a lath or\r\n  narrow piece of half-inch stuff is nailed over the ends of the boards,\r\n  thus stiffening the tray and aiding to prevent warping.\r\n\r\n  A large tray which is used by some growers is four feet square, and is\r\n  made of slats three-eighths of an inch thick, and one and a half inches\r\n  wide, the slats being nailed to three cross slats three-eighths of an\r\n  inch thick and three inches wide, and the ends nailed to a narrow strip\r\n  one-half inch thick by three-quarters of an inch wide on the other side.\r\n\r\n  Since large drying yards have been supplied with tramways and trucks\r\n  for moving the fruit instead of hand carriage, larger trays, three\r\n  feet by six or three feet by eight, have been largely employed. These\r\n  tramways lead from the cutting sheds to the sulphur boxes and thence to\r\n  various parts of the large drying grounds, making it possible to handle\r\n  large amounts of fruit at a minimum cost.\r\n\r\n  _Protecting Fruit from Dew._--In the interior there are seldom any\r\n  deposit of dew in the drying season but occasionally there are early\r\n  rains before the drying season is over. The fruit is then protected by\r\n  piling the trays one upon another, in which operation the thick cleats\r\n  serve a good purpose. In dewy regions the trays are piled at night, or\r\n  cloth or paper is sometimes stretched over the fruit, thus reducing the\r\n  discoloration resulting from deposits of moisture upon it.\r\n\r\n  _Drying Floors._--For the most part the trays are laid directly on\r\n  the ground, but sometimes a staging of posts and rails is built to\r\n  support them, about twenty inches from the ground. The drying trays are\r\n  sometimes distributed through the orchard or vineyard, thus drying the\r\n  fruit with as little carrying as possible. Others clear off a large\r\n  space outside the plantation and spread the trays where full sunshine\r\n  can be obtained. Drying spaces should be selected at a distance from\r\n  traveled roads, to prevent the deposit of dust on the fruit * * *.\r\n\r\n  _Grading._--It is of great advantage in drying to have all the fruit on\r\n  a tray of approximately the same size, and grading before cutting is\r\n  advisable. Machines are now made which accomplish this very cheaply and\r\n  quickly.\r\n\r\n  _Cutting-Sheds._--Shelter of some kind is always provided for the\r\n  fruit-cutters. Sometimes it is only a temporary bower made of poles\r\n  and beams upon which tree branches are spread as a thatch; sometimes\r\n  open-side sheds with boarded roof, and sometimes a finished fruit-house\r\n  is built, two stories high, the lower story opening with large doors\r\n  on the north side, and with a large loft above, where the dried fruit\r\n  can be sweated, packed, and stored for sale. The climate is such that\r\n  almost any shelter which suits the taste of the purse of the producer\r\n  will answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n  _Sulphuring._--The regulations promulgated under the pure food law\r\n  enacted by Congress in 1906 established an arbitrary limit to the\r\n  percentage of sulphur compounds in evaporated fruits, which was shown\r\n  by producers to be destructive to their industry, and otherwise\r\n  unwarranted and unreasonable. As a result of their protest the\r\n  enforcement of such regulations was indefinitely postponed, pending the\r\n  results of scientific investigation which began in 1898.\r\n\r\n  From the point of view of the California producer it must be held\r\n  that before the employment of the sulphur process, California cured\r\n  fruits were suitable only to the lowest culinary uses. They were of\r\n  undesirable color, devoid of natural flavor, offensive by content\r\n  of insect life. They had no value which would induce production and\r\n  discernible future. Placing the trays of freshly cut fruit in boxes or\r\n  small 'houses,' with the fumes of burning sulphur, made it possible to\r\n  preserve its natural color and flavor during the evaporation of its\r\n  surplus moisture in the clear sunshine and dry air of the California\r\n  summer. It also prevented souring, which with some fruits is otherwise\r\n  not preventable in such open air drying, and it protected the fruit\r\n  from insect attack during the drying process. By the use of sulphur\r\n  and by no other agency has it been possible to lift the production of\r\n  cured fruits of certain kinds from a low-value haphazard by-product\r\n  to a primary product for which Californians have planted orchards,\r\n  constructed packing houses and made a name in the world's markets.\r\n\r\n  The action of sulphuring is not alone to protect the fruit, it\r\n  facilitates evaporation so that about one-half less time is required\r\n  therefor. Not the least important bearing of this fact is the\r\n  feasibility of curing fruits in larger pieces. The grand half-peaches,\r\n  half-apricots, half-pears of the California cured fruits are the\r\n  direct result of the sulphur process. Without it the fruit must be cut\r\n  into small sections or ribbons, which in cooking break down into an\r\n  uninviting mass, while, with the sulphuring, it is ordinary practice\r\n  to produce the splendid halves with their natural color so preserved\r\n  that they lie in cut glass dishes in suggestive semblance to the finest\r\n  product of the canners, and are secured at a fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\n  There are various contrivances for the application of sulphur fumes to\r\n  the freshly-cut fruit. Some are small for hand carriage of trays; some\r\n  are large and the trays are wheeled into them upon trucks. The most\r\n  common is a bottomless cabinet about five or six feet high, of a width\r\n  equal to the length of the tray and a depth a little more than the\r\n  width of the tray. The cabinet has a door the whole width of one side,\r\n  and on the sides within cleats are nailed so that the trays of fruit\r\n  slip in like drawers into a bureau. Some push in the trays so that the\r\n  bottom one leaves a little space at the back, the next a little space\r\n  at the front, and so on, that the fumes may be forced by the draft to\r\n  pass between the trays back and forward. The essentials seem to be open\r\n  holes or dampers in the bottom and top of the cabinet so that the fumes\r\n  from the sulphur burning at the bottom may be thoroughly distributed\r\n  through the interior, and then all openings are tightly closed. To\r\n  secure a tight chamber the door has its edge felted and the cabinet is\r\n  made of matched lumber. The sulphur is usually put on a shovel or iron\r\n  pot, and it is ignited by a hot coal, or a hot iron, or it is thrown\r\n  on paper of which the edges are set on fire, or a little alcohol is\r\n  put on the sulphur and lighted, etc. The sulphur is usually burned\r\n  in a pit in the ground under the cabinet. The application of sulphur\r\n  must be watchfully and carefully made, and the exposure of the fruit\r\n  should only be long enough to accomplish the end desired. The exposure\r\n  required differs for different fruits, and with the same fruits in\r\n  different conditions, and must be learned by experience.\r\n\r\n  _Grading and Cleaning._--After the fruit is sufficiently dried (and it\r\n  is impossible to describe how this point may be recognized except by\r\n  the experienced touch), it is gathered from the trays in to large boxes\r\n  and taken to the fruit house. Some growers put it into a revolving drum\r\n  of punctured sheet iron, which rubs the pieces together and separates\r\n  it from dust, etc., which falls out through the apertures as the drum\r\n  revolves. Others empty the fruit upon a large wire-cloth table and pick\r\n  it over, grading it according to size and color, and at the same time\r\n  the dust and small particles of foreign matter fall through the wire\r\n  cloth. The fanning mill for cleaning grain may also be used for rapid\r\n  separation of dirt, leaves, etc., with proper arrangement of metal\r\n  screens.\r\n\r\n  _Sweating._--All fruit, if stored in mass after drying, becomes moist.\r\n  This action should take place before packing. To facilitate it, the\r\n  fruit is put in piles on the floor of the fruit house and turned\r\n  occasionally with a scoop shovel; or, if allowed to sweat in boxes,\r\n  the fruit is occasionally poured from one box to another. The sweating\r\n  equalizes the moisture throughout the mass. Some large producers have\r\n  sweat-rooms with tight walls, which preserve an even temperature. No\r\n  fruit should be packed before 'going through the sweat.' If this is not\r\n  done, discoloration and injury will result.\r\n\r\n  _Dipping before Packing._--All fruits except prunes can be packed in\r\n  good condition without dipping, provided the fruit is not over-dried.\r\n  Efforts should be made to take up the fruit when it is just\r\n  sufficiently cured to prevent subsequent fermentation. If taken from\r\n  the trays in the heat of the day and covered so that the fruit moth can\r\n  not reach it there is little danger of worms. The highest grades of\r\n  fruit are made in this way. If, however, the fruit has been over-dried\r\n  or neglected, it can be dipped in boiling water to kill eggs of vermin\r\n  and to make the fruit a little more pliable for the press. The dipping\r\n  should be done quickly, and the fruit allowed to drain and then lie in\r\n  a dark room, carefully covered, for twenty-four hours before packing.\r\n\r\n  _Packing._--To open well, packages of dried fruit should be 'faced.'\r\n  The many fine arts of paper lining, etc., must be learned by\r\n  observation. Flatten some fair specimens of the fruit to be packed (and\r\n  reference is especially made to such fruits as apricots, peaches and\r\n  nectarines) by running them through a clothes wringer or similar pair\r\n  of rollers set to flatten but not crush the fruit. Do not face with\r\n  better fruit than the package is to contain. It is a fraud which will\r\n  not in the end be profitable. Lay the flattened fruit (cup side down)\r\n  neatly in the bottom of the box. Fill the box until it reaches the\r\n  amount the box is to contain, and then apply the press until the bottom\r\n  can be nailed on. Invert the box and put on the label or brand; the\r\n  bottom then becomes the top.\r\n\r\n  Many different kinds of boxes are used. A very good size is made of\r\n  seasoned pine, six inches deep by nine inches wide by fifteen inches\r\n  long, inside measurements, and it will hold twenty-five pounds of\r\n  fruit. * * *\r\n\r\n  _Peaches._--Take the fruit when it is fully ripe, but not mushy; cut\r\n  cleanly all around to extract the pit and put on trays cup side up; get\r\n  into the sulphur box as soon as possible after cutting. Peaches are\r\n  dried both peeled and unpeeled, but drying without peeling is chiefly\r\n  done. Peeling is done with the small paring machines or with a knife.\r\n  Peeling with lye has been generally abandoned because of discoloration\r\n  of the fruit after packing, although it can be successfully done by\r\n  frequently changing the lye and using ample quantities of fresh water\r\n  for rinsing after dipping.\r\n\r\n  Clingstone peaches are successfully handled with curved knives and\r\n  spoon-shaped pitters in conjunction with ordinary fruit knives.\r\n  Different styles are carried at the general stores in the fruit\r\n  districts, and individuals differ widely in their preferences.\r\n\r\n  The weight of dried peaches which can be obtained from a certain\r\n  weight of fresh fruit, depends upon the variety; some varieties\r\n  yield at least a third more than others, and clings yield more than\r\n  freestones as a rule. Dry-fleshed peaches, like the Muir, yield one\r\n  pound dry from four or five pounds fresh, while other more juicy fruits\r\n  may require six or seven pounds.\r\n\r\n  _Nectarines._--Nectarines are handled like peaches; the production of\r\n  translucent amber fruit in the sun depends upon the skillful use of\r\n  sulphur.\"\r\n\r\n  [210] _U.

A brief history\r\n  of his life is given on page 21 of _The Grapes of New York_ and\r\n  reprinted on page 24 of _The Plums of New York_.\r\n\r\n  [264] _Fruit Trees_, published in 1817 by William Coxe, is the first\r\n  American pomology. Though written by an amateur, during most of his\r\n  life a merchant, his work was done with so much care and exhibits\r\n  such nice discrimination in selecting, describing and discussing\r\n  varieties of fruits that until the later and more complete work of\r\n  Andrew Jackson Downing and Charles Downing, Coxe's _Fruit Trees_,\r\n  competing with several other manuals, was the standard pomological work\r\n  of America. William Coxe was born in Philadelphia, May 3, 1762, and\r\n  died near Burlington, New Jersey, February 25, 1831. He seems to have\r\n  inherited wealth and with it scholarly habits and such refinement and\r\n  charm of personality that in Philadelphia and later in Burlington, to\r\n  which place he removed in early manhood, he was one of the leaders in\r\n  literary, scientific and social circles. His tastes early led him to\r\n  the cultivation of fruit and he began to grow the varieties then to\r\n  be had in America and to import sorts from England and France so that\r\n  by 1817 he was able to say that he had been \"for many years actively\r\n  engaged in the rearing, planting and cultivating fruit trees on a\r\n  scale more extensive than has been attempted by any other individual\r\n  in this country.\" Previous to this for some years, how long cannot be\r\n  said, he was the moneyed partner with one Daniel Smith in what, for the\r\n  times, was an extensive fruit-tree and ornamental nursery. Demands for\r\n  information became so frequent that he determined to put his knowledge\r\n  in print and his _Fruit Trees_ was the result. The objects he sought to\r\n  obtain in writing are well set forth in the title page as follows: \"A\r\n  VIEW of the CULTIVATION of FRUIT TREES, and the Management of Orchards\r\n  and Cider; with Accurate Descriptions of the Most Estimable Varieties\r\n  of NATIVE AND FOREIGN APPLES, PEARS, PEACHES, PLUMS, AND CHERRIES,\r\n  Cultivated in the Middle States of America; Illustrated by Cuts of\r\n  two hundred kinds of Fruits of the natural size; Intended to Explain\r\n  Some of the errors which exist relative to the origin, popular names,\r\n  and character of many of our fruits; to identify them by accurate\r\n  descriptions of their properties, and correct delineations of the full\r\n  size and natural formation of each variety; and to exhibit a system of\r\n  practice adapted to our climate, in the Successive Stages of A NURSERY,\r\n  ORCHARD, AND CIDER ESTABLISHMENT.\" He was at one time a member of the\r\n  State Legislature and later a Congressman intimately associated with\r\n  Daniel Webster. He was, also, an honorary member of the Horticultural\r\n  Society of London to which during many years he was a faithful\r\n  correspondent. It was Coxe's privilege to see the very beginnings\r\n  of commercial peach-growing in America and through his nursery, his\r\n  orchard and his book he contributed much to American peach-culture.\r\n\r\n  [265] Theodatus Timothy Lyon, fruit-grower, experimenter and writer,\r\n  was for many years the leading pomological authority of his adopted\r\n  State, Michigan. T. T. Lyon, as he always signed his name, was\r\n  born in Lima, New York, January 13, 1813, and died in South Haven,\r\n  Michigan, February 6, 1900. At the age of fifteen he moved with his\r\n  parents to Michigan where until his thirty-first year, in 1844, he\r\n  worked at most of the arts and crafts practiced by pioneers in a new\r\n  country. In the year named, he began the career of horticulturist,\r\n  by planting a nursery at Plymouth, Michigan. In the nearby regions\r\n  French missionaries had early planted orchards and old settlers had\r\n  long been importing varieties of fruit. The nomenclature of these\r\n  fruits was in uttermost confusion. T. T. Lyon set himself the task\r\n  of ascertaining the correct names of these varieties in the old\r\n  settlements of the State. The result was he became the pomological\r\n  authority of the State. In 1874 Mr. Lyon moved to the famous\r\n  \"_peach-belt_\" of western Michigan, where he lived until his death.\r\n  Here, at first, he was president of a prominent nursery company. In\r\n  1876 he was elected president of the State Horticultural Society and\r\n  continued as its active president until 1891 and from then on until\r\n  his death was honorary president. In 1888 T. T. Lyon wrote a _History\r\n  of Michigan Horticulture_ which was published in the Seventeenth\r\n  Report of the State Horticultural Society. From the beginning of\r\n  his interests in horticulture in southwestern Michigan Mr. Lyon was\r\n  particularly interested in peaches--growing seedlings, testing new\r\n  varieties, planting orchards and in every way helping to forward the\r\n  great peach-industry of the region. He was probably, in his time,\r\n  the best informed, the most accurate and the most critical judge of\r\n  peaches in this country. In 1889 he was given charge of the South\r\n  Haven Sub-station of the Michigan Experiment Station which gave him\r\n  added facilities for studying and describing fruits and a means of\r\n  publishing, through his connection with the Experiment Station,\r\n  bulletins on fruits. These, for accuracy of description of varieties,\r\n  are still unsurpassed among American pomological publications. Besides\r\n  these bulletins, the fruit-lists in the reports of the Michigan\r\n  Horticultural Society and in the American Pomological Society, during\r\n  the last half of the Nineteenth Century, show the results of his\r\n  accurate judgment of fruits. A modest man, shrinking from publicity,\r\n  his printed works but poorly represent his vast knowledge of fruits and\r\n  his great influence in the betterment of American pomology.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note:\r\n\r\nPage 144, \"but appear he peach-growers\" was changed to read \"but appear\r\nto peach-growers\".\r\n\r\nPage 373, \"Hazelhurst, Mississippi\" changed to read \"Hazlehurst,\r\nMississippi\".\r\n\r\nPage 530, \"Pavie Genisant\" was changed to read \"Pavie Genisaut\".\r\n\r\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Peaches of New York, by U.
