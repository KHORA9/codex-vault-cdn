DUTTON & COMPANY\r\n  681 FIFTH AVENUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1924\r\n  By E. P. Dutton & Company\r\n\r\n_All Rights Reserved_\r\n\r\nPrinted in the United States of America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn submitting this book to the American public the translator has\r\nthis to say.\r\n\r\nThe artistic and psychological sides of the novel are hardly to\r\nbe discussed in a preface. Great as the art of a writer may be\r\nand profound as his psychology may seem to one, the impression\r\nis largely a matter of individual variations, and this side must\r\nnaturally be left to each individual's judgment and sensibilities.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one side of the matter which deserves particular\r\nmention and motivated emphasis.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps for the first time in the history of the last few\r\ndecades that a Russian book, inspired by Russian life, written in\r\nRussia and in the Russian language, should see its first light not\r\nin Russia but abroad, and not in the language it was originally\r\nwritten but translated into a foreign tongue. During the darkest\r\nyears of Russian history, in the 'forties, 'sixties, 'eighties and\r\n'nineties of the last century, many Russian writers were forced by\r\noppression and reaction to live abroad and to write abroad, yet\r\ntheir writings would reach Russia, as they were intended primarily\r\nfor the Russian reader and Russian life. Most of Turgeniev's novels\r\nwere written while he was in France, and with the exception of his\r\nlast short story which he dictated on his deathbed, all his novels\r\nand stories were written in Russian. Hertzen, Kropotkin, and at one\r\ntime Dostoyevski, were similarly obliged to write while away from\r\ntheir native land.\r\n\r\nHere is a book written by an artist who lived and still lives in\r\nRussia, and whose intimate love for Russia and her suffering is so\r\ngreat that he finds it impossible to leave Russia even in these\r\ndays of stress and sorrow. But his book may not appear in the\r\ncountry where it was written. It is a great tragedy--this spiritual\r\nloneliness of the artist who cannot speak to his own people. In\r\nbringing out this book in English, the author tries to address\r\nhimself to the world without having the opportunity of being heard\r\nby his own people. This situation, however, is to a great extent\r\nsymbolic of the spiritual mission of Zamiatin, for no matter what\r\nthe language in which he originally writes, and no matter how\r\ntypically national his artistic perception and intuition, he is\r\nessentially universal and his vision transcends the boundaries\r\nof a purely national art. Moreover, is it not true that the more\r\ngenuinely national a man's art, and the more sincerely national his\r\npersonality, the more is he universal? Abraham Lincoln is more than\r\nan American national figure, and I doubt if the appeal Lincoln's\r\npersonality makes would be universal as it is if he were not so\r\ntypically American. It is difficult to find personalities more\r\nnational than Tolstoi or Dostoyevski, and this is perhaps the reason\r\nwhy they stand out as two of the most typically universal minds with\r\na universal appeal that the nineteenth century gave us.\r\n\r\nZamiatin is not so great as the men referred to above, but despite\r\nhis youth, he already proves to be the bearer of that quality of\r\ngreatness which characterizes a personality with a universal appeal.\r\n\r\n_We_ is, as Zamiatin himself calls it, the most jocular and the\r\nmost earnest thing he has thus far written. It is a novel that\r\nputs most poignantly and earnestly before every thoughtful reader\r\nthe most difficult problem that exists today in the civilized\r\nworld,--the problem of preservation of the independent original\r\ncreative personality. Our civilization today depends upon the\r\nenergetic movement of great masses of people. Wars, revolutions,\r\ngeneral strikes--all these phenomena involve great masses, large\r\ngroups, enormous mobs. Despite the fact that there is hardly a\r\ncorner in the world today where the average man does not make the\r\ntrite complaint, \"What we need is leadership,\" the world today\r\nseems for a time at least to have lost its capacity for producing\r\nreal leaders. For our great successes in mechanical civilization,\r\nour exceptional efforts in efficiency, tend to bring into play\r\nlarge numbers rather than great individualities. What under these\r\nconditions is the lot of a creative individuality? What the tragedy\r\nof an independent spirit under present conditions is, is pointed\r\nout in an unique way in _We_. The problem of creative individuality\r\nversus mob is today not a mere Russian problem. It is as poignant\r\nunder Bolshevist dictatorship as it is in Ford's factory.\r\n\r\nOf course the sincere, honest and frank treatment of this problem\r\nseems offensive to anyone who prefers to be a member of a mob or\r\nkeep this or that part of humanity in the state of a mob. That\r\nis why _We_ could not see light in Russia, and will probably be\r\ndisliked by those whose spiritual activities are reduced to the\r\nmechanical standards of a mechanical civilization which is devoid of\r\noriginal creative effort.\r\n\r\nA few words about the method by which Zamiatin tries to drive home\r\nto the reader his main ideas. It is the method of \"Laughter through\r\ntears,\" to use an old expression of Gogol. It is the form which is\r\ndictated by profound love for humanity, mixed with pity and hatred\r\nof those factors which are the cause of the disindividualization of\r\nman today. It is the old emotion of the ancient Catul: \"Odi et amo.\"\r\nZamiatin laughs in order to hide his tears, hence amusing as _We_\r\nmay seem and really is, it barely conceals a profound human tragedy\r\nwhich is universal today.\r\n\r\nThe reader may be interested in knowing something about Zamiatin\r\nhimself. Zamiatin does not like to tell about himself and the\r\ntranslator does not think he has the right to tell more than to\r\nquote Zamiatin's own answer to a request addressed to him a couple\r\nof years ago to write his autobiography:\r\n\r\n\"I see you want my autobiography by all means, but I assure you\r\nthat you will have to limit yourself only to an outside inspection\r\nand get but a glimpse, perhaps, into the dark windows. I seldom ask\r\nanybody to enter.\r\n\r\n\"As to the outside, you will see a lonely child without playmates,\r\nlying on a Turkish divan, hind-side up, reading a book, or under\r\nthe grand piano while his mother plays Chopin. Two steps away from\r\nChopin, just outside the window with the geraniums, in the middle of\r\nthe street, there is a small pig tied to a stake and hens fluttering\r\nin the dust.\r\n\r\n\"If you are interested in the geography, here it is--Lebedyan, in\r\nthe most Russian Tambov province about which Tolstoi and Turgeniev\r\nwrote so much. Chronology?--The end of the 'eighties and early\r\n'nineties, then Voronesh, the _Gymnasium pension_, boredom and rabid\r\ndogs on Main Street. One of these dogs got me by the leg. At that\r\ntime I loved to make different experiments on myself, and I decided\r\nto wait and see whether I would or would not get the rabies and what\r\nis most important, I was very curious: What would I feel when the\r\ntime would come for the rabies (about two weeks after the bite)? I\r\nfelt a great many things, but two weeks later I did not get the\r\nrabies, therefore I announced to the inspector in the school that I\r\ngot the rabies and must go at once to Moscow for vaccination.\r\n\r\n\"In the _Gymnasium_ I would get _A plus_ for composition and was\r\nnot always on good terms with mathematics. Perhaps because of that\r\n(sheer stubbornness) I chose the most mathematical career--the\r\nship-building department of the Petrograd Polytech.\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen years ago in the month of May--and that May was remarkable\r\nin that the snow covered the flowers--I simultaneously finished my\r\nwork for my diploma and my first short story. The short story was\r\npublished in the old _Obrazovanye_.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what else do you want? That meant that I was going to write\r\nshort stories and was going to publish them. Therefore for the\r\nfollowing three years I wrote about nothing but ice cutters, steam\r\nengines, refillers and 'The Theoretical Exploration of the Works of\r\nFloating Steam Shovels.' I couldn't help myself. I was attached to\r\nthe chair of Ship Architecture and busied myself with teaching in\r\nthe ship-building faculty, where I teach until now.\r\n\r\n\"If I mean anything in Russian Literature, I owe this completely to\r\nthe Petrograd Secret Service. In 1911 this service exiled me from\r\nPetrograd and I was forced to spend two years in a non-populated\r\nplace in Lachta. There, in the midst of the white winter silence\r\nand the green summer silence, I wrote my _Provincial_. After that\r\nthe late Ismaylov expressed in print his belief that I wore very\r\nhigh boots and was a long-haired provincial type, carrying a heavy\r\nstick, and he was later very much surprised that I 'didn't look a\r\nbit like that.' Incidentally, 'not a bit like that' I became in\r\nEngland where, during the War, I spent about two years, building\r\nships and visiting the ruins of ancient castles. I listened to the\r\nbanging of the German Zeppelin bombs and wrote a short novel _The\r\nIslanders_.\r\n\r\n\"I regret immensely that I did not witness the Russian Revolution\r\nin February and know only the October Revolution, because it was in\r\nOctober, a life preserver around my body and all the lights out,\r\npassing German submarines, that I returned to Petrograd. Because\r\nof this I felt like one who never having been in love gets up one\r\nmorning and finds himself married about ten years.\r\n\r\n\"Now I write little, perhaps because my requirements towards myself\r\nbecome greater. Three new volumes are in the hands of the publisher\r\nand begin to be published only now. The fourth will be my novel\r\n_We_, the funniest and most earnest thing I have written. However,\r\nthe most serious and most interesting novels I never wrote. They\r\nhappened to me in my life.\"\r\n\r\n  * * *\r\n\r\nZamiatin continues to live in Russia and continues to live with\r\nRussia, but such is the sarcasm of Fate that the first Russian\r\nnovel giving a real synthesis of the Russian revolution and its\r\ngreater universal meaning, this novel written by Zamiatin, should\r\nremain unknown to the Russians in Russia.\r\n\r\n  Gregory Zilboorg.\r\n  _New York_, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n                                                                  page\r\n\r\n Foreword                                     Gregory Zilboorg       v\r\n\r\n Record\r\n   1.

The great historic hour is near, when the first\r\n_Integral_ will rise into the limitless space of the universe. A\r\nthousand years ago your heroic ancestors subjected the whole earth\r\nto the power of the United State. A still more glorious task is\r\nbefore you,--the integration of the indefinite equation of the\r\nCosmos by the use of the glass, electric, fire-breathing _Integral_.\r\nYour mission is to subjugate to the grateful yoke of reason the\r\nunknown beings who live on other planets, and who are perhaps still\r\nin the primitive state of freedom. If they will not understand that\r\nwe are bringing them a mathematically faultless happiness, our duty\r\nwill be to force them to be happy. But before we take up arms, we\r\nshall try the power of words.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of The Well-Doer, the following is announced herewith\r\nto all Numbers of the United State:\r\n\r\n\"Whoever feels capable must consider it his duty to write treatises,\r\npoems, manifestoes, odes and other compositions on the greatness and\r\nthe beauty of the United State.\r\n\r\n\"This will be the first load which the _Integral_ will carry.\r\n\r\n\"Long live the United State! Long live the Numbers!! Long live the\r\nWell-Doer!!!\"\r\n\r\nI feel my cheeks are burning as I write this. To integrate the\r\ncolossal, universal equation! To unbend the wild curve, to\r\nstraighten it out to a tangent--to a straight line! For the United\r\nState is a straight line, a great, divine, precise, wise line, the\r\nwisest of lines!\r\n\r\nI, D-503, the builder of the _Integral_, I am only one of the many\r\nmathematicians of the United State. My pen, which is accustomed to\r\nfigures, is unable to express the march and rhythm of consonance;\r\ntherefore I shall try to record only the things I see, the things\r\nI think, or to be more exact, the things _we_ think. Yes, we; that\r\nis exactly what I mean, and \"We\" shall, therefore, be the title of\r\nmy records. But this will only be a derivative of our life,--of our\r\nmathematical, perfect life in the United State. If this be so, will\r\nnot this derivative be a poem in itself, despite my limitations? It\r\nwill. I believe, I know it.\r\n\r\nI feel my cheeks are burning as I write this. I feel something\r\nsimilar to what a woman probably feels when for the first time she\r\nsenses within herself the pulse of a tiny, blind, human being. It\r\nis I, and at the same time it is not I. And for many long months it\r\nwill be necessary to feed it with my life, with my blood, and then\r\nwith a pain at my heart, to tear it from myself and lay it at the\r\nfeet of the United State.\r\n\r\nYet I am ready, as everyone, or nearly everyone of us, is. I am\r\nready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWO\r\n\r\n  Ballet\r\n  Square Harmony\r\n  X\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring. From behind the Green Wall from some unknown plains the\r\nwind brings to us the yellow honeyed pollen of flowers. One's lips\r\nare dry from this sweet dust. Every moment one passes one's tongue\r\nover them. Probably, all women whom I meet in the street (and men\r\ncertainly also), have today sweet lips. This disturbs somewhat my\r\nlogical thinking. But the sky! The sky is blue. Its limpidness is\r\nnot marred by a single cloud. (How primitive was the taste of the\r\nancients, since their poets were always inspired by these senseless,\r\nformless, stupidly rushing accumulations of steam!) I love, I am\r\nsure it will not be an error if I say we love, only such a sky--a\r\nsterile, faultless sky. On such days the whole universe seems to be\r\nmoulded of the same eternal glass, like the Green Wall, and like all\r\nour buildings. On such days one sees into the very blue depth of\r\nthings. One sees their wonderful equations, hitherto unknown. One\r\nsees them in everything, even in the most ordinary everyday things.\r\n\r\nHere is an example: this morning I was on the dock where the\r\n_Integral_ is being built, and I saw the lathes; blindly, with\r\nabandon, the balls of the regulators were rotating; the cranks\r\nwere swinging from side to side with a glimmer; the working-beam\r\nproudly swung its shoulder; and the mechanical chisels were dancing\r\nto the melody of an unheard Tarantella. I suddenly perceived all\r\nthe music, all the beauty, of this colossal, of this mechanical\r\nballet, illumined by light blue rays of sunshine. Then the thought\r\ncame: why beautiful? Why is a dance beautiful? Answer: because it\r\nis an _unfree_ movement. Because the deep meaning of the dance\r\nis contained in its absolute, ecstatic submission, in the ideal\r\n_non-freedom_. If it is true that our ancestors would abandon\r\nthemselves in dancing at the most inspired moments of their lives\r\n(religious mysteries, military parades) then it means only one\r\nthing: the instinct of non-freedom has been characteristic of human\r\nnature from ancient times, and we in our life of today, we are only\r\nconsciously--\r\n\r\nI was interrupted. The switchboard clicked. I raised my eyes,--O-90,\r\nof course! In half a minute she herself will be here to take me for\r\nthe walk.\r\n\r\nDear O--! She always seems to me to look like her name, O--. She is\r\napproximately ten centimeters shorter than the required Maternal\r\nNorm. Therefore she appears all round; the rose-colored O of her\r\nlips is open to meet every word of mine. She has a round soft dimple\r\non her wrist. Children have such dimples. As she came in, the\r\nlogical fly-wheel was still buzzing in my head, and following its\r\ninertia, I began to tell her about my new formula which embraced the\r\nmachines and the dancers and all of us.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful, isn't it!\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, wonderful ... Spring!\" she replied, with a rosy smile.\r\n\r\nYou see? Spring! She talks about Spring! Females!... I became\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nWe were down in the street. The avenue was crowded. On days when\r\nthe weather is so beautiful the afternoon personal hour is usually\r\nthe hour of the supplementary walk. As always the big Musical Tower\r\nwas playing with all its pipes, the March of the United State.\r\nThe Numbers, hundreds, thousands of Numbers in light blue unifs\r\n(probably a derivative of the ancient _uniform_) with golden badges\r\non the chest,--the State number of each one, male or female,--the\r\nNumbers were walking slowly, four abreast, exaltedly keeping\r\nthe step. I, we four, were but one of the innumerable waves of\r\na powerful torrent. To my left, O-90 (if one of my long-haired\r\nancestors were writing this a thousand years ago, he would probably\r\ncall her by that funny word, _mine_), to my right, two unknown\r\nNumbers, a she-Number and a he-Number.\r\n\r\nBlue sky, tiny baby suns in each one of our badges; our faces are\r\nunclouded by the insanity of thoughts. Rays.... Do you picture it?\r\nEverything seems to be made of a kind of smiling, a ray-like matter.\r\nAnd the brass measures: Tra-ta-ta-tam.... Tra-ta-ta-tam ... stamping\r\non the brassy steps which sparkle in the sun; with every step you\r\nrise higher and higher into the dizzy blue heights.... Then, as this\r\nmorning on the dock, again I saw as if for the first time in my\r\nlife, the impeccably straight streets, the glistening glass of the\r\npavement, the divine parallelopipeds of the transparent dwellings,\r\nthe square harmony of the grayish-blue rows of Numbers. And it\r\nseemed to me that not past generations, but I myself, had won a\r\nvictory over the old god and the old life, that I myself had created\r\nall this. I felt like a tower: I was afraid to move my elbow, lest\r\nthe walls, the cupola and the machines should fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nThen without warning--a jump through centuries: I remembered\r\n(apparently through an association by contrast) a picture in\r\nthe museum, a picture of an avenue of the twentieth century,\r\na thundering many-colored confusion of men, wheels, animals,\r\nbill-boards, trees, colors, and birds.... They say all this once\r\nactually existed!\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me so incredible, so absurd, that I lost control of\r\nmyself and laughed aloud. A laugh, as if an echo of mine, reached my\r\near from the right. I turned. I saw white, very white, sharp teeth,\r\nand an unfamiliar female face.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she said, \"but you looked about you like an\r\ninspired mythological god on the seventh day of creation. You look\r\nas though you are sure that I, too, was created by you, by no one\r\nbut you. It is very flattering.\"\r\n\r\nAll this without a smile, even with a certain degree of respect--(she\r\nmay know that I am the builder of the _Integral_). In her eyes\r\nnevertheless, in her brows, there was a strange irritating X, and\r\nI was unable to grasp it, to find an arithmetical expression for\r\nit. Somehow I was confused; with a somewhat hazy mind, I tried\r\nlogically to motivate my laughter.\r\n\r\n\"It was absolutely clear that this contrast, this impassable abyss,\r\nbetween the things of today and of years ago--\"\r\n\r\n\"But why impassable?\" (What bright, sharp teeth!) \"One might throw a\r\nbridge over that abyss. Please imagine: a drum battalion, rows,--all\r\nthis existed before and consequently--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, it is clear,\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable intersection of thoughts. She said almost in\r\nthe same words the things I wrote down before the walk! Do you\r\nunderstand? Even the thoughts! It is because nobody is _one_, but\r\n_one of_. We are all so much alike--\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\" I noticed her brows which rose to the temples in an\r\nacute angle,--like the sharp corners of an X. Again I was confused,\r\ncasting a glance to the right, then to the left. To my right--she,\r\nslender, abrupt, resistantly flexible like a whip, I-330 (I saw her\r\nnumber now). To my left, O-, totally different, made all of circles\r\nwith a child-like dimple on her wrist; and at the very end of our\r\nrow, an unknown he-Number, double-curved like the letter S. We were\r\nall so different from one another....\r\n\r\nThe one to my right, I-330, apparently caught my confused eye, for\r\nshe said with a sigh, \"Yes, alas!\"\r\n\r\nI don't deny that this exclamation was quite in place, but again\r\nthere was something in her face or in her voice....\r\n\r\nWith an abruptness unusual for me, I said, \"Why 'alas'? Science is\r\ndeveloping and if not now, then within fifty or one hundred years--\"\r\n\r\n\"Even the noses will--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, noses!\" This time I almost shouted, \"Since there is still a\r\nreason, no matter what, for envy.... Since my nose is button-like\r\nand someone else's is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well your nose is rather classic, as they would say in the ancient\r\ndays, although your hands--No, no, show me your hands!\"\r\n\r\nI hate to have anyone look at my hands; they are covered with\r\nlong hair,--a stupid atavism. I stretched out my hand and said as\r\nindifferently as I could, \"Ape-like.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at my hand, then at my face.\r\n\r\n\"No, a very curious harmony.\"\r\n\r\nShe weighed me with her eyes as though with scales. The little horns\r\nagain appeared at the corners of her brows.\r\n\r\n\"He is registered in my name,\" exclaimed O-90 with a rosy smile.\r\n\r\nI made a grimace. Strictly speaking, she was out of order. This dear\r\nO-, how shall I say it? the speed of her tongue is not correctly\r\ncalculated; the speed per second of her tongue should be slightly\r\nless than the speed per second of her thoughts,--at any rate not the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the avenue the big bell of the Accumulating Tower\r\nresounded seventeen. The personal hour was at an end. I-330 was\r\nleaving us with that S-like he-Number. He has such a respectable,\r\nand I noticed then, such a familiar face. I must have met him\r\nsomewhere, but where I could not remember. Upon leaving me I-330\r\nsaid with the same X-like smile:\r\n\r\n\"Drop in day after tomorrow at auditorium 112.\"\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders: \"If I am assigned to the auditorium you\r\njust named--\"\r\n\r\nShe, with a peculiar, incomprehensible certainty: \"You will.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman had upon me a disagreeable effect, like an irrational\r\ncomponent of an equation which you cannot eliminate. I was glad to\r\nremain alone with dear O-, at least for a short while. Hand in hand\r\nwith her, I passed four lines of avenues; at the next corner she\r\nwent to the right, I to the left. O- timidly raised her round blue\r\ncrystalline eyes:\r\n\r\n\"I would like so much to come to you today and pull down the\r\ncurtains, especially today, right now....\"\r\n\r\nHow funny she is. But what could I say to her? She was with me only\r\nyesterday and she knows as well as I that our next sexual day is\r\nday-after-tomorrow. It is merely another case in which her thoughts\r\nare too far ahead. It sometimes happens that the spark comes too\r\nearly to the motor.\r\n\r\nAt parting I kissed her twice--no, I shall be exact, three times, on\r\nher wonderful blue eyes, such clear, unclouded eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THREE\r\n\r\n  A Coat\r\n  A Wall\r\n  The Tables\r\n\r\n\r\nI looked over all that I wrote down yesterday and I find that\r\nmy descriptions are not sufficiently clear. That is, everything\r\nwould undoubtedly be clear to one of us but who knows to whom my\r\n_Integral_ will some day bring these records? Perhaps you, like\r\nour ancestors, have read the great book of civilization only up to\r\nthe page of nine hundred years ago. Perhaps you don't know even\r\nsuch elementary things as the Hour Tables, Personal Hours, Maternal\r\nNorm, Green Wall, Well-Doer. It seems droll to me and at the same\r\ntime very difficult, to explain these things. It is as though, let\r\nus say, a writer of the twentieth century should start to explain\r\nin his novel such words as coat, apartment, wife. Yet if his novel\r\nhad been translated for primitive races, how could he have avoided\r\nexplaining what a coat meant? I am sure that the primitive man would\r\nlook at a coat and think, \"What is this for? It is only a burden,\r\nan unnecessary burden.\" I am sure that you will feel the same, if I\r\ntell you that not one of us has ever stepped beyond the Green Wall\r\nsince the Two Hundred Years' War.\r\n\r\nBut, dear readers, you must think, at least a little. It helps.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the history of mankind as far as our knowledge\r\ngoes, is a history of the transition from nomadic forms to more\r\nsedentary ones. Does it not follow that the most sedentary form of\r\nlife (ours) is at the same time, the most perfect one? There was a\r\ntime when people were rushing from one end of the earth to another,\r\nbut this was the prehistoric time when such things as nations, wars,\r\ncommerce, different discoveries of different Americas still existed.\r\nWho has need of these things now?\r\n\r\nI admit humanity acquired this habit of a sedentary form of life not\r\nwithout difficulty and not at once. When the Two Hundred Years' War\r\nhad destroyed all the roads which later were overgrown with grass,\r\nit was probably very difficult at first. It seemed uncomfortable to\r\nlive in cities which were cut off from each other by green debris.\r\nBut what of it? Man soon after he lost his tail probably did not\r\nlearn at once how to chase away flies without its help. I am almost\r\nsure that at first he was even lonesome without his tail, but now,\r\ncan you imagine yourself with a tail? Or can you imagine yourself\r\nwalking in the street naked, without clothes? (It is possible you go\r\nwithout clothes still.) Here we have the same case. I cannot imagine\r\na city which is not clad with a Green Wall; I cannot imagine a life\r\nwhich is not clad with the figures of our Tables.\r\n\r\nTables.... Now even, purple figures look at me austerely yet kindly\r\nfrom the golden background of the wall. Involuntarily I am reminded\r\nof the thing which was called by the ancients, \"Sainted Image,\" and\r\nI feel a desire to compose verses, or prayers which are the same.\r\nOh, why am not I a poet, so as to be able properly to glorify the\r\nTables, the heart and pulse of the United State!\r\n\r\nAll of us and perhaps all of you read in childhood while in school,\r\nthat greatest of all monuments of ancient literature, the Official\r\nRailroad Guide. But if you compare this with the Tables, you\r\nwill see side by side graphite and diamonds. Both are the same,\r\ncarbon. But how eternal, transparent, how shining the diamond!\r\nWho does not lose his breath when he runs through the pages of\r\nthe Guide? The Tables transformed each one of us, actually, into\r\na six-wheeled steel hero of a great poem. Every morning with\r\nsix-wheeled precision, at the same hour, at the same minute, we wake\r\nup, millions of us at once. At the very same hour millions like\r\none we begin our work, and millions like one, we finish it. United\r\ninto a single body with a million hands, at the very same second,\r\ndesignated by the Tables, we carry the spoons to our mouths; at the\r\nsame second we all go out to walk, go to the auditorium, to the\r\nhalls for the Taylor exercises and then to bed.\r\n\r\nI shall be quite frank: even we have not attained the absolute,\r\nexact solution of the problem of happiness. Twice a day, from\r\nsixteen to seventeen o'clock and from twenty-one to twenty-two, our\r\nunited powerful organism dissolves into separate cells; these are\r\nthe personal hours designated by the Tables. During these hours\r\nyou would see the curtains discreetly drawn in the rooms of some;\r\nothers march slowly over the pavement of the main avenue or sit at\r\ntheir desks as I sit now. But I firmly believe, let them call me\r\nan idealist and a dreamer, I believe that sooner or later we shall\r\nsomehow find even for these hours, a place in the general formula.\r\nSomehow, all of the 86,400 seconds will be incorporated in the\r\nTables of Hours.\r\n\r\nI have had opportunity to read and hear many improbable things about\r\nthose times when human beings still lived in the state of freedom,\r\nthat is, an unorganized primitive state. One thing has always\r\nseemed to me the most improbable: how could a government, even a\r\nprimitive government, permit people to live without anything like\r\nour Tables,--without compulsory walks, without precise regulation\r\nof the time to eat, for instance? They would get up and go to bed\r\nwhenever they liked. Some historians even say that in those days the\r\nstreets were lighted all night; and all night people went about the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThat I cannot understand; true, their minds were rather limited in\r\nthose days. Yet they should have understood, should they not, that\r\nsuch a life was actually wholesale murder, although slow murder,\r\nday after day? The State (humanitarianism) forbade in those days the\r\nmurder of one person, but it did not forbid the killing of millions\r\nslowly and by half. To kill one, that is, to reduce the general\r\nsum of human life by fifty years, was considered criminal, but to\r\nreduce the general sum of human life by fifty million years was not\r\nconsidered criminal! Is it not droll? Today this simple mathematical\r\nmoral problem could easily be solved in half a minute's time by any\r\nten-year-old Number, yet _they_ couldn't do it! All their Immanuel\r\nKants together couldn't do it! It didn't enter the heads of all\r\ntheir Kants to build a system of scientific ethics, that is, ethics\r\nbased on adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.\r\n\r\nFurther, is it not absurd that their State (they called it State!)\r\nleft sexual life absolutely without control? However, whenever and\r\nas much as they wanted.... Absolutely unscientific like beasts; and\r\nlike beasts they blindly gave birth to children! Is it not strange\r\nto understand gardening, chicken-farming, fishery (we have definite\r\nknowledge that they were familiar with all these things), and not\r\nto be able to reach the last step in this logical scale, namely,\r\nproduction of children,--not to be able to discover such things as\r\nMaternal and Paternal Norms?\r\n\r\nIt is so droll, so improbable, that while I write this I am afraid\r\nlest you, my unknown future readers, should think I am merely a bad\r\njester. I feel almost as though you may think I simply want to mock\r\nyou and with a most serious appearance try to relate to you absolute\r\nnonsense. But first, I am incapable of jesting, for in every joke a\r\nlie has its hidden function. And second, the science of the United\r\nState contends that the life of the ancients was exactly what I\r\nam describing, and the science of the United State cannot make a\r\nmistake! Yet how could they have State logic, since they lived in a\r\ncondition of freedom like beasts, like apes, like herds? What could\r\none expect of them, since even in our day one hears from time to\r\ntime, coming from the bottom, the primitive depths, the echo of the\r\napes?\r\n\r\nFortunately it happens only from time to time, very seldom. Happily\r\nit is only a case of small parts breaking; these may easily be\r\nrepaired without stopping the eternal great march of the whole\r\nmachine. And in order to eliminate a broken peg we have the skillful\r\nheavy hand of the Well-Doer, we have the experienced eyes of the\r\nGuardians....\r\n\r\nBy the way, I just thought of that Number whom I met yesterday,\r\nthe double-curved one like the letter S; I think I have seen him\r\nseveral times coming out of the Bureau of the Guardians. Now I\r\nunderstand why I felt such an instinctive respect for him and a\r\nkind of awkwardness when that strange I-330 at his side.... I must\r\nconfess that, that I-- ... they ring the bell, time to sleep, it is\r\ntwenty-two-thirty. Till tomorrow, then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD FOUR\r\n\r\n  The Wild Man with a Barometer\r\n  Epilepsy\r\n  If\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil today everything in life seemed to me clear (that is why, I\r\nthink, I always had a sort of partiality toward the word \"clear\"),\r\nbut today ... I don't understand. First, I really was assigned\r\nto auditorium 112 as she said, although the probability was as\r\n500:10,000,000 or 1:20,000. (500 is the number of auditoriums and\r\nthere are 10,000,000 Numbers.) And second ... but let me relate\r\nthings in successive order. The auditorium: an enormous half-globe\r\nof glass with the sun piercing through. The circular rows of\r\nnoble, globe-like, closely-shaven heads. With joy in my heart I\r\nlooked around. I believe I was looking in the hope of seeing the\r\nrose-colored scythe, the dear lips of O-, somewhere among the blue\r\nwaves of the unifs. Then I saw extraordinarily white, sharp teeth\r\nlike the.... But no! Tonight at twenty-one o'clock O- was to come\r\nto me; therefore my desire to see her was quite natural. The bell.\r\nWe stood up, sang the Hymn of the United State, and our clever\r\nphono-lecturer appeared on the platform with a sparkling golden\r\nmegaphone.\r\n\r\n\"Respected Numbers, not so long ago our archaeologists dug up a\r\nbook written in the twentieth century. In this book the ironical\r\nauthor tells about a Wild Man and a barometer. The Wild Man noticed\r\nthat every time the barometer's hand stopped on the word 'rain,' it\r\nactually rained. And as the Wild Man craved rain, he let out as much\r\nmercury as was necessary to put it at the level of the word 'rain'\r\n(on the screen a Wild Man with feathers, letting out the mercury.\r\nLaughter).\r\n\r\n\"You are laughing at him, but don't you think the 'European' of that\r\nage deserves more to be laughed at? He, like the Wild Man, wanted\r\nrain,--rain with a little r, an algebraic rain; but he remained\r\nstanding before the barometer like a wet hen. The Wild Man at least\r\nhad more courage and energy and logic, although primitive logic. The\r\nWild Man showed the ability to establish a connection between cause\r\nand effect: by letting out the mercury he made the first step on the\r\npath which....\"\r\n\r\nHere (I repeat, I am not concealing anything, I am setting down\r\neverything) I suddenly became impermeable to the quickening currents\r\ncoming from the megaphone. I suddenly felt I had come here in\r\nvain (why in vain and how could I not have come here, where I\r\nwas assigned?). Everything seemed to me empty like a shell. I\r\nsucceeded with difficulty in switching my attention in again when\r\nthe phono-lecturer came to the main theme of the evening,--to our\r\nmusic as a mathematical composition (mathematics is the cause,\r\nmusic the effect). The phono-lecturer began the description of the\r\nrecently invented musicometer.\r\n\r\n\"... By merely rotating this handle any one is enabled to produce\r\nabout three sonatas per hour. What difficulties our predecessors\r\nhad in making music! They were able to compose only by bringing\r\nthemselves to strokes of inspiration,--an extinct form of epilepsy.\r\nHere you have an amusing illustration of their achievements: the\r\nmusic of Scriabin, twentieth century. This black box,\" (a curtain\r\nparted on the platform, and we saw an ancient instrument) \"this box\r\nthey called the 'Royal Grand.' They attached to this the idea of\r\n_regality_, which also goes to prove how their music....\"\r\n\r\nAnd I don't remember anything further. Very possibly because ...\r\nI'll tell you frankly, because she, I-330, came to the \"Royal\" box.\r\nProbably I was simply startled by her unexpected appearance on the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in a fantastic dress of the ancient time, a black\r\ndress closely fitting the body, sharply delimiting the white of her\r\nshoulders and breast and that warm shadow waving with her breath\r\nbetween.... And the dazzling, almost angry teeth. A smile, a bite,\r\ndirected downward. She took her seat; she began to play something\r\nwild, convulsive, loud like all their life then,--not a shadow of\r\nrational mechanism. Of course all those around me were right; they\r\nwere laughing. Only a few ... but why is it that I too, I...?\r\n\r\nYes, epilepsy, a mental disease, a pain. A slow, sweet pain,\r\nbite, and it goes deeper and becomes sharper. And then, slowly,\r\nsunshine,--not our sunshine, not crystalline, bluish and soft,\r\ncoming through the glass bricks. No, a wild sunshine, rushing and\r\nburning, tearing everything into small bits....\r\n\r\nThe Number at my left glanced at me and chuckled. I don't know why\r\nbut I remember exactly how a microscopic saliva bubble appeared on\r\nhis lips and burst. That bubble brought me back to myself. I was\r\nagain I.\r\n\r\nLike all the other Numbers I heard now only the senseless,\r\ndisorderly cracking of the chords. I laughed; I felt so light and\r\nsimple. The gifted phono-lecturer represented to us only too well\r\nthat wild epoch. And that was all.\r\n\r\nWith what a joy I listened afterward to our contemporary music. It\r\nwas demonstrated to us at the end of the lecture for the sake of\r\ncontrast. Crystalline, chromatic scales converging and diverging\r\ninto endless series; and synthetic harmony of the formulae of Taylor\r\nand McLauren, wholesome, square and massive like the \"trousers\r\nof Pythagoras.\" Sad melodies dying away in waving movements.\r\nThe beautiful texture of the spectrum of planets, dissected by\r\nFrauenhofer lines ... what magnificent, what perfect regularity!\r\nHow pitiful the wilful music of the ancients, not limited except by\r\nthe scope of their wild imaginations!\r\n\r\nAs usual in good order, four abreast, all of us left the auditorium.\r\nThe familiar double-curved figure passed swiftly by. I respectfully\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\nDear O- was to come in an hour. I felt agitated,--agreeably and\r\nusefully. Home at last! I rushed to the house-office, handed over\r\nto the controller on duty my pink ticket and received a certificate\r\npermitting the use of the curtains. This right exists in our State\r\nonly for the sexual days. Normally we live surrounded by transparent\r\nwalls which seem to be knitted of sparkling air; we live beneath\r\nthe eye of everyone, always bathed in light. We have nothing to\r\nconceal from one another; besides, this mode of living makes the\r\ndifficult and exalted task of the Guardians much easier. Without it\r\nmany bad things might happen. It is possible that the strange opaque\r\ndwellings of the ancients were responsible for their pitiful cellish\r\npsychology. \"My (_sic!_) home is my fortress!\" How did they manage\r\nto think of such things?\r\n\r\nAt twenty-two o'clock I lowered the curtain and at the same second\r\nO- came in smiling, slightly out of breath. She extended to me\r\nher rosy lips and her pink ticket. I tore off the stub but I\r\ncould not tear myself away from the rosy lips up to the last\r\nmoment,--twenty-two-fifteen.\r\n\r\nThen I showed her my diary and I talked; I think I talked very\r\nwell on the beauty of a square, a cube, a straight line. At first\r\nshe listened so charmingly, she was so rosy, when suddenly a tear\r\nappeared in her blue eyes, then another, and a third fell straight\r\non the open page (page 7). The ink blurred; well, I shall have to\r\ncopy it again.\r\n\r\n\"My dear O-, if only you, if....\"\r\n\r\n\"What if? If what?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the old lament about a child or perhaps something new\r\nregarding, regarding ... the other one? Although it seems as though\r\nsome ... but that would be too absurd!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD FIVE\r\n\r\n  The Square\r\n  The Rulers of the World\r\n  An Agreeable and Useful Function\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain with you, my unknown reader; I talk to you as though you\r\nwere, let us say, my old comrade, R-13, the poet with the lips of a\r\nnegro,--well, everyone knows him. Yet you are somewhere on the moon,\r\nor on Venus, or on Mars. Who knows you? Where and who are you?\r\n\r\nImagine a square, a living, beautiful square. Imagine that this\r\nsquare is obliged to tell you about itself, about its life. You\r\nrealize that this square would hardly think it necessary to mention\r\nthe fact that all its four angles are equal. It knows this too\r\nwell. This is such an ordinary, obvious thing. I am in exactly\r\nthe same square position. Take the pink checks for instance,\r\nand all that goes with them: for me they are as natural as the\r\nequality of the four angles of the square. But for you they are\r\nperhaps more mysterious and hard to understand than the binom of\r\nNewton. Let me explain: an ancient sage once said a clever thing\r\n(accidentally, beyond doubt). He said, \"Love and Hunger rule the\r\nworld.\" Consequently, to dominate the world, man had to win a\r\nvictory over hunger after paying a very high price. I refer to the\r\ngreat Two Hundred Years' War, the war between the city and the land.\r\nProbably on account of religious prejudices, the primitive peasants\r\nstubbornly held on to their \"bread.\"[1] In the 35th year before the\r\nfoundation of the United State, our contemporary petroleum food was\r\ninvented. True, only about two-tenths of the population of the globe\r\ndid not die out. But how beautifully shining the face of the earth\r\nbecame when it was cleared of its impurities!\r\n\r\n[1] This word came down to us for use only as a poetic form, for the\r\nchemical constitution of this substance is unknown to us.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the 0.2 which survived, have enjoyed the greatest\r\nhappiness in the bosom of the United State. But is it not clear that\r\nsupreme bliss and envy are only the numerator and the denominator\r\nrespectively, of the same fraction, happiness? What sense would the\r\ninnumerable sacrifices of the Two Hundred Years' War have for us\r\nif a reason were left in our life for jealousy? Yet such a reason\r\npersisted because there remained button-like noses and classical\r\nnoses (_Cf_: our conversation during the promenade). For there were\r\nsome whose love was sought by everyone and others whose love was\r\nsought by no one.\r\n\r\nNaturally, having conquered hunger (that is, algebraically speaking,\r\nhaving achieved the total of bodily welfare), the United State\r\ndirected its attack against the second ruler of the world, against\r\nlove. At last this element also was conquered, that is, organized\r\nand put into a mathematical formula. It is already three hundred\r\nyears since our great historic Lex Sexualis was promulgated: \"A\r\nNumber may obtain a license to use any other Number as a sexual\r\nproduct.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest is only a matter of technique. You are carefully examined\r\nin the laboratory of the Sexual Department where they find the\r\ncontent of the sexual hormones in your blood, and they make out for\r\nyou accordingly a Table of sexual days. Then you file an application\r\nto enjoy the services of Number so and so, or Numbers so and so. You\r\nget for that purpose a check-book (pink). That is all.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that under such circumstances there is no more reason\r\nfor envy or jealousy. The denominator of the fraction of happiness\r\nis reduced to zero and the whole fraction is thus converted into\r\na magnificent infiniteness. The thing which was for the ancients\r\nthe source of innumerable stupid tragedies has been converted in\r\nour time into an harmonious, agreeable and useful function of the\r\norganism, a function like sleep, like physical labor, the taking\r\nof food, digestion, etc., etc. Hence you see how the great power\r\nof logic purifies everything it happens to touch. Oh, if only you\r\nunknown readers can conceive this divine power! If you will only\r\nlearn to follow it to the end!\r\n\r\nIt is very strange: while I was writing today of the loftiest\r\nsummit of human history, all the while I breathed the purest\r\nmountain air of thought, but within me it was and remains cloudy,\r\ncobwebby, and there is a kind of cross-like, four-pawed X. Or\r\nperhaps it is my paws and I feel like that only because they are\r\nalways before my eyes, my hairy paws. I don't like to talk about\r\nthem. I dislike them. They are a trace of a primitive epoch. Is it\r\npossible that there is in me...?\r\n\r\nI wanted to strike out all this because it trespasses on the limits\r\nof my synopsis. But then I decided: no, I shall not! Let this diary\r\ngive the curve of the most imperceptible vibrations of my brain,\r\nlike a precise seismograph, for at times such vibrations serve as\r\nforewarnings.... Certainly this is absurd! This certainly should be\r\nstricken out; we have conquered all the elements; catastrophes are\r\nnot possible any more.\r\n\r\nNow everything is clear to me. The peculiar feeling inside is a\r\nresult of that very same square situation of which I spoke in the\r\nbeginning. There is no X in me. There can be none. I am simply\r\nafraid lest some X will be left in you, my unknown readers. I\r\nbelieve you will understand that it is harder for me to write than\r\nit ever was for any author throughout human history. Some of them\r\nwrote for contemporaries, some for the future generations but\r\nnone of them ever wrote for their ancestors, or beings like their\r\nprimitive, distant ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD SIX\r\n\r\n  An Accident\r\n  The Cursed \"It's Clear\"\r\n  Twenty-four Hours\r\n\r\n\r\nI must repeat, I made it my duty to write concealing nothing.\r\nTherefore I must point out now that sad as it may be, the process\r\nof hardening and crystallization of life has evidently not been\r\ncompleted even here in our State. A few steps remain to be made\r\nbefore we reach the ideal. The ideal (it's clear), is to be found\r\nwhere nothing _happens_, but here.... I will give you an example: in\r\nthe State paper I read that in two days the holiday of Justice will\r\nbe celebrated on the Plaza of the Cube. This means that again some\r\nNumber has impeded the smooth run of the great State machine. Again\r\nsomething that was not foreseen, or forecalculated _happened_.\r\n\r\nBesides, something _happened_ to me. True, it occurred during the\r\npersonal hour, that is during the time specifically assigned to\r\nunforeseen circumstances, yet....\r\n\r\nAt about sixteen (to be exact, ten minutes to sixteen), I was at\r\nhome. Suddenly the telephone: \"D-503?\"--a woman's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you free?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I, I-330. I shall run over to you immediately. We shall go\r\ntogether to the Ancient House. Agreed?\"\r\n\r\nI-330!... This I- irritates me, repels me. She almost frightens me;\r\nbut just because of that I answered, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nIn five minutes we were in an aero. Blue sky of May. The light sun\r\nin its golden aero buzzed behind us without catching up and without\r\nlagging behind. Ahead of us a white cataract of a cloud. Yes, a\r\nwhite cataract of a cloud nonsensically fluffy like the cheeks of\r\nan ancient cupid. That cloud was disturbing. The front window was\r\nopen; it was windy; lips were dry. Against one's will one passed the\r\ntongue constantly over them and thought about lips.\r\n\r\nAlready we saw in the distance the hazy green spots on the other\r\nside of the Wall. Then a slight involuntary sinking of the heart,\r\ndown--down--down, as if from a steep mountain, and we were at the\r\nAncient House.\r\n\r\nThat strange, delicate, blind establishment is covered all around\r\nwith a glass shell, otherwise it would undoubtedly have fallen\r\nto pieces long ago. At the glass door we found an old woman all\r\nwrinkles, especially her mouth which was all made up of folds and\r\npleats. Her lips had disappeared, having folded inward; her mouth\r\nseemed grown together. It seemed incredible that she should be able\r\nto talk and yet she did:\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear, come again to see my little house?\"\r\n\r\nHer wrinkles shone, that is, her wrinkles diverged like rays, which\r\ncreated the impression of shining.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, grandmother,\" answered I-330.\r\n\r\nThe wrinkles continued to shine.\r\n\r\n\"And the sun, eh,--do you see it, you rogue, you! I know, I know.\r\nIt's all right. Go all by yourselves,--I shall remain here in the\r\nsunshine.\"\r\n\r\nHmm.... Apparently my companion was a frequent guest here. Something\r\ndisturbed me; probably that unpleasant optical impression,--the\r\ncloud on the smooth blue surface of the sky.\r\n\r\nWhile we were ascending the wide, dark stairs, I-330 said, \"I love\r\nher, that old woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Perhaps for her mouth,--or perhaps for nothing, just\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. She continued walking upstairs with a faint\r\nsmile or perhaps without a smile at all.\r\n\r\nI felt very guilty. It is clear that there must not be \"love, just\r\nso,\" but \"love because of.\" For all elements of nature should be....\r\n\r\n\"It's clear ...\" I began, but I stopped at that word and cast\r\na furtive look at I-330. Did she notice it or not? She looked\r\nsomewhere, down; her eyes were closed like curtains.\r\n\r\nIt struck me suddenly: evening about twenty-two; you walk on the\r\navenue and among the brightly lighted, transparent, cubic cells, are\r\ndark spaces, lowered curtains, and there behind the curtains....\r\nWhat has she behind her curtains? Why did she phone me today? Why\r\ndid she bring me here? and all this....\r\n\r\nShe opened a heavy, squeaking, opaque door and we found ourselves\r\nin a sombre disorderly space (they called it an \"apartment\"). The\r\nsame strange \"royal\" musical instrument and a wild, unorganized,\r\ncrazy loudness of colors and forms like their ancient music. A white\r\nplane above, dark blue walls, red, green, orange bindings of ancient\r\nbooks, yellow bronze candelabras, a statue of Buddha, furniture\r\nwith lines distorted by epilepsy, impossible to reduce to any clear\r\nequation.\r\n\r\nI could hardly bear that chaos. But my companion apparently\r\npossessed a stronger constitution.\r\n\r\n\"This is my most beloved--\" she suddenly caught herself (again a\r\nsmile,--bite, and white sharp teeth), \"to be more exact, the most\r\nnonsensical of all 'apartments'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or to be most exact, of all the States. Thousands of microscopic\r\nStates, fighting eternal wars, pitiless like--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, it's clear,\" said I-330 with apparent sincerity.\r\n\r\nWe passed through a room where we found a few small children's beds\r\n(children in those days were also private property). Then more\r\nrooms, glimmering mirrors, sombre closets, unbearably loud-colored\r\ndivans, an enormous \"fireplace,\" a large mahogany bed. Our\r\ncontemporary beautiful, transparent, eternal glass was represented\r\nhere only by pitiful, delicate, tiny squares of windows.\r\n\r\n\"And to think; here there was love 'just so'; they burned and\r\ntortured themselves\" (again the curtain of the eyes was lowered),\r\n\"What a stupid, uneconomical spending of human energy. Am I not\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke as though reading my thoughts but in her smile there\r\nremained always that irritating X. There behind the curtains\r\nsomething was going on, I don't know what, but something that made\r\nme lose my patience. I wanted to quarrel with her, to scream at her\r\n(exactly, to scream), but I had to agree. It was impossible not to\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nWe stopped in front of a mirror. At that moment I saw only her eyes.\r\nAn idea came to me: human beings are built as nonsensically as these\r\nstupid \"apartments,\" human heads are opaque, and there are only two\r\nvery small windows that lead inside,--the eyes. She seemed to have\r\nguessed my thoughts; she turned around: \"Well, here they are, my\r\neyes,--well\" (this suddenly, then silence).\r\n\r\nThere were in front of me two gloomy dark windows and behind them\r\ninside, such strange hidden life. I saw there only fire, burning\r\nlike a peculiar \"fireplace\" and unknown figures resembling....\r\n\r\nAll this was certainly very natural; I saw in her eyes the\r\nreflection of my own face. But my feelings were unnatural and not\r\nlike me. Evidently the depressing influence of the surroundings was\r\nbeginning to tell on me. I felt definitely fear. I felt as if I were\r\ntrapped and caged in a strange cage. I felt that I was caught in the\r\nwild hurricane of ancient life.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know ...\" said I-330, \"step out for a moment into the next\r\nroom.\" Her voice came from there,--from inside, from behind the dark\r\nwindow-eyes,--where the fireplace was blazing.\r\n\r\nI went out, sat down. From a shelf on the wall there looked\r\nstraight into my face, somewhat smiling, a snub-nosed, asymmetrical\r\nphysiognomy of one of the ancient poets; I think it was Pushkin.\r\n\r\n\"Why do I sit here enduring this smile with such resignation and\r\nwhat is this all about? Why am I here? And why all these strange\r\nsensations, this irritating, repellent female, this strange game?\"\r\n\r\nThe door of the closet slammed; there was the rustle of silk. I\r\nfelt it difficult to restrain myself from getting up and, and.... I\r\ndon't remember exactly; probably I wanted to tell her a number of\r\ndisagreeable things. But she had already appeared.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in a short bright-yellowish dress, black hat, black\r\nstockings. The dress was of light silk,--I saw clearly very long\r\nblack stockings above the knees, an uncovered neck and the shadow\r\nbetween....\r\n\r\n\"It's clear that you want to seem original. But is it possible that\r\nyou--?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is clear,\" interrupted I-330, \"that to be original means to\r\nstand out among others; consequently to be original means to violate\r\nthe law of equality. What was called in the language of the ancients\r\n'to be common' is with us only the fulfilling of one's duty. For--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, exactly,\" I interrupted impatiently, \"and there is no\r\nuse, no use....\"\r\n\r\nShe came near the bust of the snub-nosed poet, lowered the curtains\r\non the wild fire of her eyes and said, this time I think she was\r\nreally in earnest, or perhaps she merely wanted to soften my\r\nimpatience with her, but she said a very reasonable thing:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think it surprising that once people could stand types\r\nlike this? Not only stand them but worship them. What a slavish\r\nspirit, don't you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's clear ... that is...!\" I wanted ... (damn that cursed \"it's\r\nclear!\").\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I understand. But in fact these were rulers stronger than\r\nthe crowned ones. Why were they not isolated and exterminated? In\r\nour State--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, in our State--\" I began.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she laughed. I saw the laughter in her eyes. I saw the\r\nresounding sharp curve of that laughter, flexible, tense like a\r\nwhip. I remember my whole body shivered. I thought of grasping her\r\n... and I don't know what.... I had to do something, mattered little\r\nwhat; automatically I looked at my golden badge, glanced at my\r\nwatch,--ten minutes to seventeen!\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think it is time to go?\" I said in as polite a tone as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\"And if I should ask you to stay here with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Do you realize what you are saying? In ten minutes I must be\r\nin the auditorium.\"\r\n\r\n\"And 'all the Numbers must take the prescribed courses in art and\r\nscience',\" said I-330 with my voice.\r\n\r\nThen she lifted the curtain, opened her eyes,--through the dark\r\nwindows the fire was blazing.\r\n\r\n\"I have a physician in the Medical Bureau; he is registered to me;\r\nif I ask him, he will give you a certificate declaring that you are\r\nill. All right?\"\r\n\r\nUnderstood! At last I understood where this game was leading.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, so! But you know that every honest Number as a matter of course\r\nmust immediately go to the office of the Guardians and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And as a matter not of course?\" (Sharp smile-bite) \"I am very\r\ncurious to know; will you or will you not go to the Guardians?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to remain here?\"\r\n\r\nI grasped the knob of the door. It was a brass knob, a cold, brass\r\nknob and I heard, cold like brass, her voice:\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute, may I?\"\r\n\r\nShe went to the telephone, called a Number,--I was so upset it\r\nescaped me,--and spoke loudly: \"I shall be waiting for you in the\r\nAncient House. Yes, yes, alone.\"\r\n\r\nI turned the cold brass knob.\r\n\r\n\"May I take the aero?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, certainly, please!\"\r\n\r\nIn the sunshine at the gate the old woman was dozing like a plant.\r\nAgain I was surprised to see her grown-together mouth open, and to\r\nhear her say:\r\n\r\n\"And your lady, did she remain alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the old woman grew together again; she shook her head;\r\napparently even her weakening brain understood the stupidity and the\r\ndanger of the behaviour of that woman.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen o'clock exactly, I was at the lecture. There I suddenly\r\nrealized that I did not tell the whole truth to the old woman. I-330\r\nwas not there alone _now_. Possibly this fact, that I involuntarily\r\ntold the old woman a lie, was torturing me now and distracting my\r\nattention. Yes, not alone,--that was the point.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-one-thirty o'clock I had a free hour. I could therefore\r\nhave gone to the office of the Guardians to make my report; but\r\nafter that stupid adventure I was so tired--besides, the law\r\nprovides two days. I shall have time tomorrow; I have another\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD SEVEN\r\n\r\n  An Eyelash\r\n  Taylor\r\n  Henbane and Lily of the Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nNight. Green, orange, blue. The red royal instrument. The yellow\r\ndress. Then a brass Buddha. Suddenly it lifted the brass eyelids\r\nand sap began to flow from it, from Buddha. Sap also from the yellow\r\ndress. Even in the mirror,--drops of sap, and from the large bed\r\nand from the children's bed and soon from myself.... It is horror,\r\nmortally sweet horror!...\r\n\r\nI woke up. Soft blue light, the glass of the walls, of the chairs,\r\nof the table was glimmering. This calmed me. My heart stopped\r\npalpitating. Sap! Buddha! How absurd! I am sick, it is clear; I\r\nnever saw dreams before. They say that to see dreams was a common\r\nnormal thing with the ancients. Yes, after all, their life was a\r\nwhirling carousel: green, orange, Buddha, sap,--but we, people\r\nof today, we know all too well that dreaming is a serious mental\r\ndisease. I.... Is it possible that _my_ brain, this precise, clean,\r\nglittering mechanism, like a chronometer without a speck of dust on\r\nit, is...? Yes it is, now. I really feel there in the brain some\r\nforeign body like an eyelash in the eye. One does not feel one's\r\nwhole body but this eye with a hair in it, one cannot forget it for\r\na second....\r\n\r\nThe cheerful, crystalline sound of the bell at my head. Seven\r\no'clock. Time to get up. To the right and to the left as in mirrors,\r\nto the right and to the left through the glass walls I see others\r\nlike myself, other rooms like my own, other clothes like my own,\r\nmovements like mine, duplicated thousands of times. This invigorates\r\nme; I see myself as a part of an enormous, vigorous, united body;\r\nand what precise beauty! Not a single superfluous gesture, or bow,\r\nor turn. Yes, this Taylor was undoubtedly the greatest genius of the\r\nancients. True, he did not come to the idea of applying his method\r\nto the whole life, to every step throughout the twenty-four hours of\r\nthe day; he was unable to integrate his system from one o'clock to\r\ntwenty-four. I cannot understand the ancients. How could they write\r\nwhole libraries about some Kant and take notice only slightly of\r\nTaylor, of this prophet who saw ten centuries ahead?\r\n\r\nBreakfast was over. The hymn of the United State had been\r\nharmoniously sung; rhythmically, four abreast we walked to\r\nthe elevators, the motors buzzed faintly and swiftly we went\r\ndown--down--down, the heart sinking slightly. Again that stupid\r\ndream or some unknown function of that dream. Oh, yes! Yesterday in\r\nthe aero, then down--down! Well, it is all over, anyhow. Period. It\r\nis very fortunate that I was so firm and brusque with her.\r\n\r\nThe car of the underground railway carried me swiftly to the place\r\nwhere the motionless, beautiful body of the _Integral_, not yet\r\nspiritualized by fire, was glittering in the docks in the sunshine.\r\nWith closed eyes I dreamed in formulae. Again I calculated in\r\nmy mind what was the initial velocity required to tear away the\r\n_Integral_ from the earth. Every second the mass of the _Integral_\r\nwould change because of the expenditure of the explosive fuel. The\r\nequation was very complex with transcendant figures. As in a dream\r\nI felt, right here in the firm calculated world, how someone sat\r\ndown at my side, barely touching me and saying, \"Pardon.\" I opened\r\nmy eyes. At first, apparently because of an association with the\r\n_Integral_, I saw something impetuously flying into the distance: a\r\nhead; I saw pink wing-ears sticking out on the sides of it, then the\r\ncurve of the overhanging back of the head, the double-curved letter\r\nS.\r\n\r\nThrough the glass walls of my algebraic world, again I felt the\r\neyelash in my eye. I felt something disagreeable, I felt that today\r\nI must....\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, please,\"--I smiled at my neighbor and bowed.\r\n\r\nNumber S-4711 I saw glittering on his golden badge (that is why I\r\nassociated him with the letter S from the very first moment: an\r\noptical impression which remained unregistered by consciousness).\r\nHis eyes sparkled, two sharp little drills; they were revolving\r\nswiftly, drilling in deeper and deeper. It seemed that in a moment\r\nthey would drill in to the bottom and would see something that I do\r\nnot even dare to confess to myself....\r\n\r\nThat bothersome eyelash became wholly clear to me. S- was one of\r\nthem, one of the Guardians, and it would be the simplest thing\r\nimmediately, without deferring to tell him everything!\r\n\r\n\"I went yesterday to the Ancient House ...\" my voice was strange,\r\nhusky, flat,--I tried to cough.\r\n\r\n\"That is good. It must have given you material for some instructive\r\ndeductions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes ... but ... You see, I was not alone; I was in the company of\r\nI-330, and then....\"\r\n\r\n\"I-330? You are fortunate. She is a very interesting, gifted woman;\r\nshe has a host of admirers.\"\r\n\r\nBut he too--then during the promenade.... Perhaps he is even\r\nassigned as her he-Number! No, it is impossible to tell him,\r\nunthinkable. This was perfectly clear.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, certainly, very,\" I smiled, broader and broader, more\r\nstupidly, and felt as if my smile made me look foolish, naked.\r\n\r\nThe drills reached the bottom; revolving continually they screwed\r\nthemselves back into his eyes. S- smiled double-curvedly, nodded and\r\nslid to the exit.\r\n\r\nI covered my face with the newspaper (I felt as if everybody were\r\nlooking at me), and soon I forgot about the eyelash, about the\r\nlittle drills, about everything, I was so upset by what I read\r\nin the paper: \"According to authentic information, traces of an\r\norganization which still remains out of reach, have again been\r\ndiscovered. This organization aims at liberation from the beneficial\r\nyoke of the State.\"\r\n\r\nLiberation! It is remarkable how persistent human criminal instincts\r\nare! I use deliberately the word \"criminal,\" for freedom and crime\r\nare as closely related as--well, as the movement of an aero and its\r\nspeed: if the speed of an aero equals zero, the aero is motionless;\r\nif human liberty is equal to zero, man does not commit any crime.\r\nThat is clear. The way to rid man of criminality is to rid him of\r\nfreedom. No sooner did we rid ourselves of freedom (in the cosmic\r\nsense centuries are only a \"no sooner\"), than suddenly some unknown\r\npitiful degenerates.... No, I cannot understand why I did not go\r\nimmediately yesterday to the Bureau of the Guardians. Today, after\r\nsixteen o'clock, I shall go there without fail.\r\n\r\nAt sixteen-ten I was in the street; at once I noticed O-90 at the\r\ncorner; she was all rosy with delight at the encounter. She has a\r\nsimple, round mind. A timely meeting; she would understand and lend\r\nme support. Or, ... no, I did not need any support; my decision was\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nThe pipes of the Musical Tower thundered out harmoniously the\r\nMarch--the same daily March. How wonderful the charm of this\r\ndailiness, of this constant repetition and mirror-like smoothness!\r\n\r\n\"Out for a walk?\" Her round blue eyes opened toward me widely, blue\r\nwindows leading inside; I penetrate there unhindered; there is\r\nnothing in there, I mean nothing foreign, nothing superfluous.\r\n\r\n\"No, not for a walk. I must go.\" I told her where. And to my\r\nastonishment I saw her rosy round mouth form a crescent with the\r\nhorns downward as if she tasted something sour. This angered me.\r\n\r\n\"You she-Numbers seem to be incurably eaten up by prejudices. You\r\nare absolutely unable to think abstractly. Forgive me the word but\r\nthis I call bluntness of mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You? ... to the spies? How ugly! And I went to the Botanical Garden\r\nand brought you a branch of lily-of-the-valley....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, 'and I'? Why this 'and'? Just like a woman!\"\r\n\r\nAngrily (this I must confess), I snatched the flowers. \"Here they\r\nare, your lilies-of-the-valley. Well, smell them! Good? Yes? Why not\r\nuse a little bit of logic? The lilies-of-the-valley smell good; all\r\nright! But you cannot say about an odor, about the conception of an\r\nodor, that it _is_ good or bad, can you? You can't, can you? There\r\nis the smell of lilies-of-the-valley and there is the disagreeable\r\nsmell of henbane. Both are odors. The ancient States had their\r\nspies; we have ours ... yes, spies! I am not afraid of words. But\r\nis it not clear to you that there the spies were henbane; here they\r\nare lilies-of-the-valley? Yes, lilies-of-the-valley, yes!\"\r\n\r\nThe rosy crescent quivered. Now I understand that it was only my\r\nimpression but at that moment I was certain she was going to laugh.\r\nI shouted still louder:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, lilies-of-the-valley! And there is nothing funny about it,\r\nnothing funny!\"\r\n\r\nThe smooth round globes of heads passing by were turning towards us.\r\nO-90 gently took my hand.\r\n\r\n\"You are so strange today ... are you ill?\"\r\n\r\nMy dream.... Yellow color.... Buddha.... It was at once born clearly\r\nupon me that I must go to the Medical Bureau.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are right, I am sick,\" I said with joy (that seems to\r\nme an inexplicable contradiction; there was nothing to be joyful\r\nabout).\r\n\r\n\"You must go at once to the doctor. You understand that; you are\r\nobliged to be healthy; it seems strange to have to prove it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear O-, of course you are right. Absolutely right.\"\r\n\r\nI did not go to the Bureau of the Guardians; I could not; I had\r\nto go to the Medical Bureau; they kept me there until seventeen\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nIn the evening (incidentally, the Bureau of Guardians is closed\r\nevenings)--in the evening O- came to see me. The curtains were not\r\nlowered. We busied ourselves with the arithmetical problems of an\r\nancient text-book. This occupation always calms and purifies our\r\nthoughts. O- sat over her note book, her head slightly inclined\r\nto the left; she was so assiduous that she poked out her left\r\ncheek with the tongue from within. She looked so child-like, so\r\ncharming.... I felt everything in me was pleasant, precise and\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nShe left. I remained alone. I breathed deeply two times (it is\r\nvery good exercise before retiring for the night). Suddenly,--an\r\nunexpected odor reminiscent of something very disagreeable! I soon\r\nfound out what was the matter: a branch of lily-of-the-valley\r\nwas hidden in my bed. Immediately everything was aroused again,\r\ncame up from the bottom. Decidedly, it was tactless on her part\r\nsurreptitiously to put these lilies-of-the-valley there. Well, true\r\nI did not go; I didn't, but was it my fault that I felt indisposed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD EIGHT\r\n\r\n  An Irrational Root\r\n  R-13\r\n  The Triangle\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was long ago during my school-days, when I first encountered the\r\nsquare-root of minus one. I remember it all very clearly; a bright\r\nglobe-like class hall, about a hundred round heads of children\r\nand Plappa--our mathematician. We nicknamed him Plappa; it was\r\na very much used-up mathematician, loosely screwed together; as\r\nthe member of the class who was on duty that day would be putting\r\nthe plug into the socket behind we would hear at first from the\r\nmegaphone, \"Plap-plap-plap-plap--tshshsh....\" Only then the lesson\r\nwould follow. One day Plappa told us about irrational numbers, and\r\nI remember I wept and banged the table with my fist and cried, \"I\r\ndo not want that square-root of minus one; take that square-root\r\nof minus one away!\" This irrational root grew into me as something\r\nstrange, foreign, terrible; it tortured me; it could not be thought\r\nout. It could not be defeated because it was beyond reason.\r\n\r\nNow that square-root of minus one is here again. I read over what\r\nI have written and I clearly see that I was insincere with myself,\r\nthat I lied to myself in order to avoid seeing that square-root of\r\nminus one. My sickness, etc., is all nonsense; _I could go there_. I\r\nfeel sure that if such a thing had happened a week ago I should have\r\ngone without hesitating. Why then am I unable to go now?... Why?\r\n\r\nToday, for instance, at exactly sixteen-ten I stood before the\r\nglittering Glass Wall. Above was the shining, golden, sun-like sign:\r\n\"Bureau of Guardians.\" Inside, a long queue of bluish-gray unifs\r\nawaiting their turns, faces shining like the oil lamps in an ancient\r\ntemple. They came to accomplish a great thing: they came to put on\r\nthe altar of the United State their beloved ones, their friends,\r\ntheir own selves. My whole being craved to join them, yet ... I\r\ncould not; my feet were as though melted into the glass plates of\r\nthe sidewalk. I simply stood there looking foolish.\r\n\r\n\"Heh, mathematician! Dreaming?\"\r\n\r\nI shivered. Black eyes varnished with laughter looked at me,--thick\r\nnegro lips! It was my old friend the poet, R-13, and with him rosy\r\nO-. I turned around angrily (I still believe that if they had\r\nnot appeared I should have entered the Bureau and have torn the\r\nsquare-root of minus one out of my flesh).\r\n\r\n\"Not dreaming at all; if you will, 'standing in adoration',\" I\r\nretorted quite brusquely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, certainly! You, my friend, should never have become\r\na mathematician; you should have become a poet, a great poet! Yes,\r\ncome over to our trade, to the poets. Heh? If you will, I can\r\narrange it in a jiffy. Heh?\"\r\n\r\nR-13 usually talks very fast: His words run in torrents, his thick\r\nlips sprinkle. Every P is a fountain, every \"poets\" a fountain.\r\n\r\n\"So far I have served knowledge, and I shall continue to serve\r\nknowledge.\"\r\n\r\nI frowned. I do not like, I do not understand jokes, and R-13 has\r\nthe bad habit of joking.\r\n\r\n\"Heh, to the deuce with knowledge. Your much-heralded knowledge is\r\nbut a form of cowardice. It is a fact! Yes, you want to encircle the\r\ninfinite with a wall and you fear to cast a glance behind the wall.\r\nYes, sir! And if ever you should glance beyond the wall you would be\r\ndazzled and close your eyes,--yes,--\"\r\n\r\n\"Walls are the foundation of every human--\" I began.\r\n\r\nR-13 sprinkled his fountain. O- laughed rosily and roundly. I\r\nwaved my hand: \"Well, you may laugh, I don't care.\" I was busy\r\nwith something else. I had to find a way of eating up, of crushing\r\ndown, that square-root of minus one. \"Suppose,\" I offered, \"we go\r\nto my place and do some arithmetical problems.\" (The quiet hour of\r\nyesterday afternoon came to my memory; perhaps today also....)\r\n\r\nO- glanced at R-, then serenely and roundly at me; the soft,\r\nendearing color of our pink checks came to her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"But today I am.... I have a check to him today.\" (A glance at R-.)\r\n\"And tonight he is busy, so that--\"\r\n\r\nThe moist varnished lips whispered good-naturedly: \"Half an hour\r\nis plenty for us, is it not, O-? I am not a great lover of your\r\nproblems; let us simply go over to my place and chat.\"\r\n\r\nI was afraid to remain alone with myself, or to be more correct,\r\nwith that new strange self, who by some curious coincidence bore\r\nmy number, D-503. So I went with R-. True, he is not precise,\r\nnot rhythmic, his logic is jocular and turned inside out, yet we\r\nare.... Three years ago we both chose our dear, rosy O-. This tied\r\nour friendship more firmly together than our school-days did. In\r\nR-'s room everything seems like mine; the Tables, the glass of the\r\nchairs, the table, the closet, the bed. But as we entered, R- moved\r\none chair out of place, then another,--the room became confused,\r\neverything lost the established order and seemed to violate every\r\nrule of Euclid's geometry. R- remained the same as before; in Taylor\r\nand in mathematics he always lagged at the tail of the class.\r\n\r\nWe recalled Plappa, how we boys used to paste the whole surface\r\nof his glass legs with paper notes expressing our thanks (we all\r\nloved Plappa). We recalled our priest (it goes without saying that\r\nwe were taught not the \"law\" of ancient religion but the law of\r\nthe United State). Our priest had a very powerful voice; a real\r\nhurricane would come out of the megaphone. And we children would\r\nyell the prescribed texts after him with all our lung-power. We\r\nrecalled how our scapegrace, R-13, used to stuff the priest with\r\nchewed paper; every word was thus accompanied by a paper wad shot\r\nout. Naturally, R- was punished, for what he did was undoubtedly\r\nwrong, but now we laughed heartily;--by we I mean our triangle, R-,\r\nO-, and I, I must confess, I too.\r\n\r\n\"And what if he had been a living one? Like the ancient ones, heh?\"\r\nWe'd have b... b..., a fountain running from the fat bubbling lips.\r\nThe sun was shining through the ceiling, the sun above, the sun from\r\nthe sides, its reflection from below. O- on R-13's lap and minute\r\ndrops of sunlight in O-'s blue eyes. Somehow my heart warmed up. The\r\nsquare-root of minus one became silent and motionless....\r\n\r\n\"Well, how is your _Integral_? Will you soon hop off to enlighten\r\nthe inhabitants of the planets? You'd better hurry up, my boy, or\r\nwe poets will have produced such a devilish lot that even your\r\n_Integral_ will be unable to lift the cargo. 'Every day from eight\r\nto eleven' ...\" R- wagged his head and scratched the back of it.\r\nThe back of his head is square; it looks like a little valise (I\r\nrecalled for some reason an ancient painting \"In the Cab\"). I felt\r\nmore lively.\r\n\r\n\"You too are writing for the _Integral_? Tell me about it. What are\r\nyou writing about? What did you write today, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Today I did not write; today I was busy with something else.\"\r\n\"B-b-busy\" sprinkled straight into my face.\r\n\r\n\"What else?\"\r\n\r\nR- frowned. \"What? What? Well, if you insist I'll tell you. I was\r\nbusy with the Death Sentence. I was putting the Death Sentence into\r\nverse. An idiot--and to be frank, one of our poets.... For two\r\nyears we all lived side by side with him and nothing seemed wrong.\r\nSuddenly he went crazy. 'I,' said he, 'am a genius! And I am above\r\nthe law.' All that sort of nonsense.... But it is not a thing to\r\ntalk about.\"\r\n\r\nThe fat lips hung down. The varnish disappeared from the eyes. He\r\njumped up, turned around and stared through the wall. I looked at\r\nhis tightly closed little \"valise\" and thought, \"What is he handling\r\nin his little valise now?\"\r\n\r\nA moment of awkward asymmetric silence. I could not see clearly what\r\nwas the matter but I was certain there was something....\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately the antediluvian time of those Shakespeares and\r\nDostoyevskis (or what were their names?) is past,\" I said in a voice\r\ndeliberately loud.\r\n\r\nR- turned his face to me. Words sprinkled and bubbled out of him as\r\nbefore, but I thought I noticed there was no more joyful varnish to\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear mathematician, fortunately, fortunately. We are the happy\r\narithmetical mean. As you would put it, the integration from zero to\r\ninfinity, from imbeciles to Shakespeare. Do I put it right?\"\r\n\r\nI do not know why (it seemed to me absolutely uncalled for) I\r\nrecalled suddenly the other one, _her_ tone. A thin invisible\r\nthread stretched between her and R- (what thread?). The square-root\r\nof minus one began to bother me again. I glanced at my badge;\r\nsixteen-twenty-five o'clock! They had only thirty-five minutes for\r\nthe use of the pink check.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must go.\" I kissed O-, shook hands with R- and went to the\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nAs I crossed the avenue I turned around. Here and there in the\r\nhuge mass of glass penetrated by sunshine there were grayish-blue\r\nsquares, the opaque squares of lowered curtains,--the squares of\r\nrhythmic, Taylorized happiness. On the seventh floor I found R-13's\r\nsquare. The curtains were already lowered.\r\n\r\nDear O-.... Dear R-.... He also has (I do not know why I write this\r\n\"also,\" but I write as it comes from my pen), he too has something\r\nwhich is not entirely clear in him. Yet I, he and O-, we are a\r\ntriangle; I confess, not an isosceles triangle but a triangle\r\nnevertheless. We, to speak in the language of our ancestors (perhaps\r\nto you, my planetary readers, this is the more comprehensible\r\nlanguage) we are a family. And one feels so good at times, when one\r\nis able for a short while, at least, to close oneself within a firm\r\ntriangle, to close oneself away from anything that....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD NINE\r\n\r\n  Liturgy\r\n  Iambus\r\n  The Cast-Iron Hand\r\n\r\n\r\nA solemn bright day. On such days one forgets one's weaknesses,\r\ninexactitudes, illnesses, and everything is crystalline and\r\nimperturbable like our new glass....\r\n\r\nThe Plaza of the Cube. Sixty-six imposing concentric circles--stands.\r\nSixty-six rows of quiet serene faces. Eyes reflecting the shining\r\nof the sky,--or perhaps it is the shining of the United State.\r\nRed like blood, are the flowers--the lips of the women. Like soft\r\ngarlands the faces of the children in the first rows, nearest the\r\nplace of action. Profound, austere, gothic silence.\r\n\r\nTo judge by the descriptions which reach us from the ancients,\r\nthey felt somewhat like this during their \"Church services,\" but\r\nthey served their nonsensical unknown god; we serve our rational\r\ngod, whom we most thoroughly know. Their god gave them nothing but\r\neternal, torturing seeking; our god gives us absolute truth, that\r\nis, he has rid us of any kind of doubt. Their god did not invent\r\nanything cleverer than sacrificing oneself, nobody knows what for;\r\nwe bring to our god, The United State, a quiet, rational, carefully\r\nthought-out sacrifice.\r\n\r\nYes, it was a solemn liturgy for the United State, a reminiscence of\r\nthe great days, years, of the Two Hundred Years' War,--a magnificent\r\ncelebration of the victory of _all_ over _one_, of the _sum_ over\r\nthe individual!\r\n\r\nThat _one_ stood on the steps of the Cube which was filled with\r\nsunlight. A white, no not even white, but already colorless glass\r\nface, lips of glass. And only the eyes--thirsty, swallowing, black\r\nholes leading into that dreadful world from which he was only a few\r\nminutes away. The golden badge with the number already had been\r\ntaken off. His hands were tied with a red ribbon. (A symbol of\r\nancient custom. The explanation of it is that in the old times when\r\nthis sort of thing was not done in the name of the United State, the\r\nconvicted naturally considered that they had the right to resist,\r\nhence their hands were usually bound with chains.)\r\n\r\nOn the top of the Cube, next to the Machine, the motionless,\r\nmetallic figure of him whom we call the Well-Doer. One could not see\r\nhis face from below. All one could see was that it was bounded by\r\naustere, magnificent, square lines. And his hands.... Did you ever\r\nnotice how sometimes in a photograph the hands, if they were too\r\nnear the camera, come out enormous? They then compel your attention,\r\novershadow everything else. Those hands of his, heavy hands, quiet\r\nfor the time being, were stony hands,--it seemed the knees on which\r\nthey rested must have had pains to bear their weight.\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of those hands rose slowly. A slow cast-iron gesture;\r\nobeying the will of the lifted hand, a Number came out on the\r\nplatform. It was one of the State poets, whose fortunate lot it was\r\nto crown our celebration with his verses.\r\n\r\nDivine iambic brass verses thundered over the many stands. They\r\ndealt with the man, who, his reason lost and lips like glass, stood\r\non the steps and waited for the logical consequences of his own\r\ninsane deeds.\r\n\r\n... A blaze.... Buildings were swaying in those iambic lines, and\r\nsprinkling upward their liquified golden substance, they broke and\r\nfell. The green trees were scorched, their sap slowly ran out and\r\nthey remained standing like black crosses, like skeletons. Then\r\nappeared Prometheus (that meant _us_).\r\n\r\n  \"... he harnessed fire\r\n  With machines and steel\r\n  And fettered chaos with Law....\"\r\n\r\nThe world was renovated; it became like steel,--a sun of steel,\r\ntrees of steel, men of steel. Suddenly an insane man, \"Unchained\r\nthe fire and set it free,\" and again the world had perished....\r\nUnfortunately I have a bad memory for poetry, but one thing I am\r\nsure of: one could not choose more instructive or more beautiful\r\nparables.\r\n\r\nAnother slow, heavy gesture of the cast-iron hand and another poet\r\nappeared on the steps of the Cube. I stood up! Impossible! But ...\r\nthick negro lips,--it _was_ he. Why did he not tell me that he was\r\nto be invested with such high.... His lips trembled; they were gray.\r\nOh, I certainly understood; to be face to face with the Well-Doer,\r\nface to face with the hosts of Guardians! Yet one should not allow\r\noneself to be so upset.\r\n\r\nSwift sharp verses like an axe.... They told about an unheard-of\r\ncrime, about sacrilegious poems in which the Well-Doer was\r\ncalled.... But no, I do not dare to repeat....\r\n\r\nR-13 was pale when he finished, and looking at no one (I did not\r\nexpect such bashfulness of him) he descended and sat down. For\r\nan infinitesimal fraction of a second I saw right beside him\r\nsomebody's face--a sharp, black triangle--and instantly I lost it;\r\nmy eyes, thousands of eyes, were directed upward toward the Machine.\r\nThen--again the superhuman, cast-iron, gesture of the hand.\r\n\r\nSwayed by an unknown wind the criminal moved; one step ... one more,\r\n... then the last step in his life. His face was turned to the sky,\r\nhis head thrown backward--he was on his last.-- ... Heavy, stony\r\nlike fate, the Well-Doer went around the machine, put his enormous\r\nhand on the lever.... Not a whisper, not a breath around; all eyes\r\nwere upon that hand.... What crushing, scorching power one must feel\r\nto be the tool, to be the resultant of hundreds of thousands of\r\nwills! How great his lot!\r\n\r\nAnother second. The hand moved down, switching in the current. The\r\nlightning-sharp blade of the electric ray.... A faint crack like\r\na shiver, in the tubes of the Machine.... The prone body, covered\r\nwith a light phosphorescent smoke; then suddenly, under the eyes of\r\nall, it began to melt,--to melt, to dissolve with terrible speed.\r\nAnd then nothing; just a pool of chemically pure water which only a\r\nmoment ago was so red and pulsated in his heart....\r\n\r\nAll this was simple; all of us were familiar with the phenomenon,\r\ndissociation of matter,--yes, the splitting of the atoms of the\r\nhuman body! Yet every time we witnessed it, it seemed a miracle; it\r\nwas a symbol of the superhuman power of the Well-Doer.\r\n\r\nAbove, in front of Him, the burning faces of the female numbers,\r\nmouths half open from emotion, flowers swaying in the wind.[2]\r\nAccording to custom, ten women were covering with flowers the\r\nunif of the Well-Doer, which was still wet with spray. With the\r\nmagnificent step of a supreme priest He slowly descended, slowly\r\npassed between the rows of stands; and like tender white branches\r\nthere rose toward Him the arms of the women; and, millions like\r\none, our tempestuous cheers! Then cheers in honor of the Guardians,\r\nwho all unseen, were present among us.... Who knows, perhaps the\r\nfancy of the ancient man foresaw them centuries ahead, when he\r\ncreated the gentle and formidable \"guardian-angels\" assigned to each\r\none from the day of his birth?\r\n\r\n[2] These flowers naturally were brought from the Botanical Museum.\r\nI, personally, am unable to see anything beautiful in flowers, or\r\nin anything else that belongs to the lower kingdom which now exists\r\nonly beyond the Green Wall. Only rational and useful things are\r\nbeautiful: machines, boots, formulae, food, etc.\r\n\r\nYes, there was in our celebration something of the ancient\r\nreligions, something purifying like a storm.... You whose lot it may\r\nbe to read this, are you familiar with such emotions? I am sorry for\r\nyou if you are not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TEN\r\n\r\n  A Letter\r\n  A Manhunt\r\n  Hairy I\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday was for me a kind of filter-paper which chemists use for\r\nfiltering their solutions (all suspended and superfluous particles\r\nremain on the paper). This morning I went downstairs all purified\r\nand distilled, transparent.\r\n\r\nDownstairs in the hall the controller sat at a small table,\r\nconstantly looking at her watch and recording the Numbers who were\r\nleaving. Her name is U- ... well, I prefer not to give her Number,\r\nfor I fear I may not write kindly about her. Although, as a matter\r\nof fact, she is a very respectable, mature woman. The only thing I\r\ndo not like in her is that her cheeks fold down a little like gills\r\nof a fish (although I do not see anything wrong in this appearance).\r\nShe scratched with her pen and I saw on the page \"D-503\"--and\r\nsuddenly, splash! an ink-blot. No sooner did I open my mouth to call\r\nher attention to that, than she raised her head and blotted me with\r\nan inky smile. \"There is a letter for you. You will receive it,\r\ndear. Yes, yes, you will.\"\r\n\r\nI knew a letter, after she had read it, must go through the Bureau\r\nof the Guardians (I think it is unnecessary to explain in detail\r\nthis natural order of things); I would receive it not later than\r\ntwelve o'clock. But that tiny smile confused me; the drop of ink\r\nclouded the transparency of the distilled solution. At the dock of\r\nthe _Integral_ I could not concentrate; I even made a mistake in my\r\ncalculations,--that never happened to me before.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock, again the rosy-brown fish-gills' smile, and at\r\nlast the letter was in my hands. I cannot say why I did not read\r\nit right there, but I put it in my pocket and ran into my room.\r\nI opened it and glanced it over and ... and sat down. It was the\r\nofficial notification advising me that Number I-330 had had me\r\nassigned to her and that today at twenty-one o'clock, I was to go to\r\nher. Her address was given.\r\n\r\n\"No! After all that happened! After I showed her frankly my attitude\r\ntoward her! Besides, how could she know that I did not go to the\r\nBureau of the Guardians? She had no way of knowing that I was ill\r\nand could not.... And despite all this....\"\r\n\r\nA dynamo was whirling and buzzing in my head. Buddha ... yellow\r\n... lilies-of-the-valley ... rosy crescent.... Besides,--besides,\r\nO- wanted to come to see me today! I am sure she would not believe\r\n(how could one believe), that I had absolutely nothing to do with\r\nthe matter, that ... I am sure also that we (O- and I) will have\r\na difficult, foolish and absolutely illogical conversation. No,\r\nanything but that! Let the situation solve itself mechanically; I\r\nshall send her a copy of this official communication.\r\n\r\nWhile I was hastily putting the paper in my pocket, I noticed my\r\nterrible ape-like hand. I remembered how that day during our walk,\r\nshe took my hand and looked at it. Is it possible that she really\r\n... that she....\r\n\r\nA quarter to twenty-one. A white northern night. Everything was\r\nglass,--greenish. But it was a different kind of glass, not like\r\nours, not genuine but very breakable,--a thin glass shell and within\r\nthat shell things were flying, whirling, buzzing. I should not have\r\nbeen surprised if suddenly the cupola of the auditorium had risen in\r\nslow, rolling clouds of smoke; or if the ripe moon had sent an inky\r\nsmile,--like that one at the little table this morning; or if in all\r\nthe houses suddenly all the curtains had been lowered and behind the\r\ncurtains....\r\n\r\nI felt something peculiar; my ribs were like iron bars that\r\ninterfered, decidedly interfered, with my heart, giving it too\r\nlittle space. I stood at a glass door on which were the golden\r\nletters _I-330_; I-330 sat at the table with her back to me; she was\r\nwriting something. I stepped in.\r\n\r\n\"Here....\" I held out the pink check, \"... I received the\r\nnotification this noon and here I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"How punctual you are! Just a minute please, may I? Sit down. I\r\nshall finish in a minute.\"\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyes to the letter. What had she there, behind her\r\nlowered curtains? What would she say? What would she do in a second?\r\nHow to learn it? How to calculate it, since she comes from beyond,\r\nfrom the wild ancient land of dreams? I looked at her in silence.\r\nMy ribs were iron bars. The space for the heart was too small....\r\nWhen she speaks her face is like a swiftly revolving, glittering\r\nwheel; you cannot see the separate bars. But at that moment the\r\nwheel was motionless. I saw a strange combination: dark eyebrows\r\nrunning right to the temples--a sharp, mocking triangle; and still\r\nanother dark triangle with its apex upward--two deep wrinkles from\r\nthe nose to the angles of the mouth. And these two triangles somehow\r\ncontradicted each other. They gave the whole face that disagreeable,\r\nirritating X, or cross; a face obliquely marked by a cross.\r\n\r\nThe wheel started to turn; its bars blurred.\r\n\r\n\"So you did not go to the Bureau of Guardians after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did ... I did not feel well ... I could not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes? I thought so; something _must_ have prevented you, matters\r\nlittle what (sharp teeth--a smile). But now you are in my hands. You\r\nremember: 'Any Number who within forty-eight hours fails to report\r\nto the Bureau is considered....'\"\r\n\r\nMy heart banged so forcibly that the iron bars bent. If I were\r\nnot sitting ... like a little boy, how stupid! I was caught like\r\na little boy and stupidly I kept silent. I felt I was in a net;\r\nneither my legs nor my arms....\r\n\r\nShe stood up and stretched herself lazily. She pressed the button\r\nand the curtains on all four walls fell with a slight rustle. I was\r\ncut off from the rest of the world, alone with her.\r\n\r\nShe was somewhere behind me, near the closet door. The unif\r\nwas rustling, falling. I was listening, _all_ listening. I\r\nremembered,--no, it glistened in my mind for one hundredth of a\r\nsecond,--I once had to calculate the curve of a street membrane\r\nof a new type. (These membranes are handsomely decorated and are\r\nplaced on all the avenues, registering all street conversations for\r\nthe Bureau of Guardians.) I remembered a rosy concave, trembling\r\nmembrane,--a strange being consisting of one organ only, an ear. I\r\nwas at that moment such a membrane.\r\n\r\nNow the \"click\" of the snap-button at her collar, at her breast, and\r\n... lower. The glassy silk rustled over her shoulders and knees,\r\nover the floor. I heard--and this was clearer than actual seeing--I\r\nheard how one foot stepped out of the grayish-blue heap of silk,\r\nthen the other.... Soon I'd hear the creak of the bed and ...\r\n\r\nThe tensely stretched membrane trembled and registered the\r\nsilence,--no, the sharp hammer-like blows of the heart against the\r\niron bars and endless pauses between beats. And I heard, saw, how\r\nshe, behind me hesitated for a second, thinking. The door of the\r\ncloset.... It slammed; again silk ... silk....\r\n\r\n\"Well, all right.\"\r\n\r\nI turned around. She was dressed in a saffron-yellow dress of an\r\nancient style. This was a thousand times worse than if she had not\r\nbeen dressed at all. Two sharp points, through the thin tissue\r\nglowing with rosiness, two burning embers piercing through ashes;\r\ntwo tender, round knees....\r\n\r\nShe was sitting in a low armchair. In front of her on a small square\r\ntable, I noticed a bottle filled with something poisonously green\r\nand two small glasses on thin legs. In the corner of her mouth she\r\nhad a very thin paper tube; she was ejecting smoke formed by the\r\nburning of that ancient smoking substance whose name I do not now\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nThe membrane was still vibrating. Within the sledge-hammer was\r\npounding the red-hot iron bars of my chest. I heard distinctly every\r\nblow of the hammer, and ... what if she too heard it?\r\n\r\nBut she continued to produce smoke very calmly; calmly she looked at\r\nme; and nonchalantly she flicked ashes on the pink check!\r\n\r\nWith as much self-control as possible I asked, \"If you still feel\r\nthat way, why did you have me assigned to you? And why did you make\r\nme come here?\"\r\n\r\nAs if she had not heard at all, she poured some of the green liquid\r\nfrom the bottle into a small glass and sipped it.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful liqueur! Want some?\"\r\n\r\nThen I understood; alcohol! Like lightning there came to memory what\r\nI saw yesterday: the stony hand of the Well-Doer, the unbearable\r\nblade of the electric ray; there on the Cube, the head thrown\r\nbackward, the stretched-out body! I shivered.\r\n\r\n\"Please listen,\" I said, \"You know, do you not, that any one who\r\npoisons himself with nicotine, more particularly with alcohol, is\r\nseverely treated by the United State?\"\r\n\r\nDark brows raised high to the temples, the sharp mocking triangle.\r\n\r\n\"'It is more reasonable to annihilate a few than to allow many to\r\npoison themselves.... And degeneration,' ... etc.... This is true to\r\nthe point of indecency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indecency?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. To let out into the street such a group of bald-headed naked\r\nlittle truths. Only imagine please. Imagine, say, that persistent\r\nadmirer of mine, S-, well, you know him. Then imagine: if he should\r\ndiscard the deception of clothes and appear in public in his true\r\nform ... oh!\" She laughed. But I clearly saw her lower, sorrowful\r\ntriangle; two deep grooves from the nose to the mouth. And for\r\nsome reason these grooves made me think: that double-curved being,\r\nhalf-hunched, with wing-like ears,--he embraced her? her, such ...\r\nOh!\r\n\r\nNaturally, I try now merely to express my abnormal feelings of that\r\nmoment. Now, as I write, I understand perfectly that all this is as\r\nit should be; that he, S-4711, like any other honest Number has a\r\nperfect right to the joys of life and that it would be unjust....\r\nBut I think the point is quite clear.\r\n\r\nI-330 laughed a long, strange laugh. Then she cast a look at me,\r\ninto me.\r\n\r\n\"The most curious thing is that I am not in the least afraid of you.\r\nYou are such a dear, I am sure of it! You would never think of going\r\nto the Bureau and reporting that I drink liqueurs and smoke. You\r\nwill be sick or busy, or I don't know what.... Furthermore, I am\r\nsure you will drink this charming poison with me.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an impertinent, mocking tone! I felt definitely that in a\r\nmoment I should hate her. (Why in a moment? In fact I hated her all\r\nthe time.)\r\n\r\nI-330 turned over the little glass of green poison straight into\r\nher mouth. Then she stood up, and all rosy through the translucent\r\nsaffron-yellow tissue, she made a few steps and stopped behind my\r\nchair.... Suddenly her arms were about my neck ... her lips grew\r\ninto mine, no, even somewhere much deeper, much more terribly.... I\r\nswear all this was very unexpected for me. That is why perhaps ...\r\nfor I could not (at this moment I see clearly) I could not myself\r\nhave the desire to....\r\n\r\nUnbearably sweet lips. (I suppose it was the taste of the liqueur.)\r\nIt was as though burning poison were being poured into me, and more\r\nand more....\r\n\r\nI tore away from the earth and began revolving as an independent\r\nplanet,--down--down--following an uncalculable curve....\r\n\r\nWhat happened next I am able to describe only in an approximate way,\r\nonly by way of more or less corresponding analogies.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to me before but it is true: we who live on the\r\nearth, we are always walking over a seething red sea of fire which\r\nis hidden in the womb of the earth. We never think of it. But\r\nimagine the ground under our feet suddenly transformed into a thin\r\nglass shell; suddenly we should behold...!\r\n\r\nI became glass-like and saw within myself. There were two selves in\r\nme. One, the former D-503, Number D-503; and the other.... Before,\r\nthat other used only to show his hairy paws from time to time, but\r\nnow the whole other self left his shell. That shell was breaking,\r\nand in a moment....\r\n\r\nGrasping with all my strength the last straw (the arms of the\r\nchair), I asked loudly (so as to hear my first self), \"Where, where\r\ndid you get this poison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this? A physician, one of my....\"\r\n\r\n\"'One of my! one of my' what?\" And my other self jumped up suddenly\r\nand yelled: \"I won't allow it! I want no one but me.... I shall\r\nkill any one who.... Because I.... You.\" ... I saw my other self\r\ngrasp her rudely with his hairy paws, tear the silk, and put his\r\nteeth in her flesh!... I remember exactly, his teeth!...\r\n\r\nI do not remember how, but I-330 slipped away and I saw her\r\nstraightened, her head raised high, her eyes overlain by that cursed\r\nimpenetrable curtain. She stood leaning with her back against the\r\ncloset door and listening to me.\r\n\r\nI remember I was on the floor; I embraced her limbs, kissed her\r\nknees and cried supplicatingly, \"At once, right away, right away.\"\r\n\r\nSharp teeth.... The sharp mocking triangle of the brows.... She bent\r\nover and in silence unbuttoned my badge.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, dear--dear.\"\r\n\r\nI began hastily to remove my unif. But I-330, silent as before,\r\nlifted my badge to my eyes, showing me the clock upon it. It was\r\ntwenty-two-twenty-five.\r\n\r\nI became cold. I knew what it meant to be out in the street after\r\ntwenty-two-thirty. My insanity disappeared at once. I was again\r\nI. I saw clearly one thing: I hated her, hated her, hated-- ...\r\nWithout saying good-bye, without looking back, I ran out of the\r\nroom. Hurriedly trying to fasten the badge back in its place, I\r\nran down the stairs (I was afraid lest some one notice me in the\r\nelevator), and jumped out into a deserted street.\r\n\r\nEverything was in its place; life so simple, ordinary, orderly.\r\nGlittering glass houses, pale glass sky, a greenish, motionless\r\nnight. But under that cool glass something wild, something red\r\nand hairy, was silently seething. I was gasping for breath but I\r\ncontinued to run, so as not to be late.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt that my badge which I had hurriedly pinned on, was\r\ndetaching itself; it came off and fell to the sidewalk. I bent\r\nover to pick it up and in the momentary silence I heard somebody's\r\nsteps. I turned. Someone small and hunched was disappearing around\r\nthe corner. At least so it seemed. I started to run as fast as I\r\ncould. The wind whistled in my ears. At the entrance of my house I\r\nstopped and looked at the clock; one minute to twenty-two-thirty! I\r\nlistened; nobody behind. It was my foolish imagination, the effect\r\nof the poison.\r\n\r\nThe night was full of torture. My bed seemed to lift itself under\r\nme, then to fall again, then up again! I used autosuggestion: \"At\r\nnight all the Numbers must sleep; sleeping at night is a duty just\r\nlike working during the day. To sleep at night is necessary for the\r\nnext day's work. Not to sleep at night is criminal.\" Yet I could\r\nnot sleep--I could not. I was perishing! I was unable to fulfill my\r\nduties to the United State! I....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD ELEVEN\r\n\r\nNo, I Can't; Let It Be without Headings!\r\n\r\n\r\nEvening. It is somewhat foggy. The sky is covered with a\r\nmilky-golden tissue, and one cannot see what is there, beyond,\r\non the heights. The ancients \"knew\" that the greatest, bored\r\nskeptic--their God, lived there. We know that crystalline, blue,\r\nnaked, indecent Nothing is there. _I_ do not know any more what\r\n_is_ there. I have learned too many things of late. Knowledge,\r\nself-confident knowledge which is sure that it is faultless, is\r\nfaith. I had firm faith in myself; I believed that I knew all about\r\nmyself. But then.... I look in the mirror. And for the first time\r\nin my life, yes, _for the first time in my life_, I see clearly,\r\nprecisely, consciously and with surprise, I see myself as some\r\n\"him!\" I am \"he.\" Frowning, black, straight brows; between them\r\nlike a scar, there is a vertical wrinkle. (Was there that wrinkle\r\nbefore?) Steel gray eyes encircled by the shadow of a sleepless\r\nnight. And behind that steel ... I understand; I never before knew\r\nwhat there was behind that steel. From there (this \"there\" is at\r\nonce so near and so infinitely distant!) I look at myself--at \"him.\"\r\nAnd I know surely that \"he\" with his straight brows is a stranger,\r\nthat I meet him here for the first time in my life. The real I is\r\n_not_ he.\r\n\r\nNo. Period. All this is nonsense. And all these foolish emotions are\r\nonly delirium, the result of last night's poisoning.... Poisoning\r\nwith what? With a sip of that green poison or with her? It matters\r\nlittle. I write all this merely in order to demonstrate how\r\nstrangely the precise and sharp human reason may become confused.\r\nThis reason, strong enough to make infinity which the ancients\r\nfeared so much, understandable by means of.... The switch buzzes,\r\n\"Number R-13.\" Well, I am even glad; alone I should....\r\n\r\n_Twenty minutes later_:\r\n\r\nOn the plane of this paper, in a world of two dimensions, these\r\nlines follow each other, but in another world they.... I am losing\r\nthe sense for figures.... Twenty minutes! Perhaps two hundred or two\r\nhundred thousand!...\r\n\r\nIt seems so strange, quietly, deliberately, measuring every word,\r\nto write down my adventure with R-. Imagine yourself sitting down\r\nat your own bed, crossing your legs, watching curiously how you\r\nyourself shrivel in the very same bed. My mental state is similar to\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nWhen R-13 came in I was perfectly quiet and normal. I began with\r\nsincere admiration to tell him how wonderfully he succeeded in\r\nversifying the death sentence of that insane man, and that his\r\npoem more than anything else had smothered and annihilated the\r\ntransgressor of the law.\r\n\r\n\"More than that,\" I said, \"if I were ordered to prepare a\r\nmathematical draught of the Machine of the Well-Doer, I should\r\nundoubtedly,--undoubtedly, put on that draught some of your\r\nverses!\"--Suddenly I saw R-'s eyes becoming more and more opaque,\r\nhis lips acquiring a gray tint.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?--Well.... Merely that I am dead sick of it; everybody keeps\r\non: 'the death-sentence, the death-sentence!' I want to hear no more\r\nof it! You understand? I do not want....\" He became serious, rubbing\r\nhis neck--that little valise filled with luggage which I cannot\r\nunderstand. A silence. There! He found something in that little\r\nvalise of his, removed it, unwrapped it, spread it out; his eyes\r\nbecame covered with the varnish of laughter. He began:\r\n\r\n\"I am writing something for your _Integral_. Yes.... I am!\" He was\r\nhimself again; bubbling, sprinkling lips; words splashing like a\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\n\"You see, it is the ancient legend of paradise.\" (\"p\" like a\r\nfountain.) \"That legend referred to us of today, did it not? Yes.\r\nOnly think of it, think of it a moment! There were two in paradise\r\nand the choice was offered to them: happiness without freedom, or\r\nfreedom without happiness. No other choice. _Tertium non datur_.\r\nThey, fools that they were, chose freedom. Naturally, they longed\r\nfor centuries afterwards for fetters, for the fetters of yore.\r\nThis was the meaning of their world-weariness, _Weltschmerz_. For\r\ncenturies! And only we found a way to regain happiness.... No,\r\nlisten, follow me! The ancient god and we, side by side at the\r\nsame table! Yes, we helped god definitely and finally to defeat\r\nthe devil. It was he, the devil, who lead people to transgression,\r\nto taste pernicious freedom, he the cunning serpent? And we came\r\nalong, planted a boot on his head and ... squash! Done with him!\r\nParadise again! We returned to the simple-mindedness and innocence\r\nof Adam and Eve. No more meddling with good and evil and all\r\nthat; everything is simple again, heavenly, childishly simple!\r\nThe Well-Doer, The Machine, The Cube, the giant Gas Bell, The\r\nGuardians,--all these are good. All this is magnificent, beautiful,\r\nnoble, lofty, crystalline, pure. For all this preserves our\r\nnon-freedom, that is, our happiness. In our place those ancients\r\nwould indulge in discussions, deliberations, etc. They would break\r\ntheir heads trying to make out what was moral or unmoral. But we....\r\nWell, in short, these are the highlights of my little paradise\r\npoem. What do you think of it? And above all the style is most\r\nsolemn, pious. Understand me? Nice little idea, is it not? Do you\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\nOf course I understood. I remember my thoughts at that moment: \"his\r\nappearance is nonsensical and lacking in symmetry, yet what an\r\norderly-working mind he has!\" This made him dear to me, that is to\r\nthe real _me_. (I still insist that _I_ of before is the real one;\r\nmy I of late is, certainly, only an illness.)\r\n\r\nApparently R- read my thought in my face; he put his hand on my\r\nshoulders and laughed: \"Oh you!... Adam! By the way, about Eve....\"\r\nHe searched for something in his pockets, took out a little book,\r\nturned over a few leaves and said, \"For the day-after-tomorrow,--oh,\r\nno, two days from now,--O-90 has a pink check on you. How about\r\nit?... As before?... You want her to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right then, I'll tell her. You see she herself is very\r\nbashful.... What a funny story! You see, for me she has only a\r\npink-check affection, but for you!... And you, you did not even come\r\nto tell us how a fourth member sneaked into our triangle! Who is it?\r\nRepent, sinner! Come on!\"\r\n\r\nA curtain rose inside me; rustle of silk, green bottle, lips....\r\nWithout any reason whatever I exclaimed (oh, why didn't I restrain\r\nmyself at that moment?), \"Tell me, R-, did you ever have the\r\nopportunity to try nicotine or alcohol?\"\r\n\r\nR- sucked in his lips, looked at me from under his brows. I\r\ndistinctly heard his thoughts: \"Friend though he is, yet....\" And he\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\"What shall I say? Strictly speaking, no. But I know a woman....\"\r\n\r\n\"I-330?\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"What! You? You too?\" R- was full of laughter; he chuckled, ready to\r\nsplash over.\r\n\r\nMy mirror was hanging in such a way that in order to see R- clearly\r\nI had to turn and look across the table. From my armchair I could\r\nsee now only my own forehead and eyebrows. Then I, the real I,\r\nsuddenly saw in the mirror a broken, quivering line of brow; I, the\r\nreal I, heard suddenly a wild disgusting cry: \"What? What does that\r\n'also' mean? What does that 'also' mean? I demand....\"\r\n\r\nWidely parted negro lips.... Eyes bulging. I (the real I) grasped my\r\nother wild, hairy, heavily breathing self forcibly. I (the real I)\r\nsaid to him, to R-, \"In the name of the Well-Doer, please forgive\r\nme. I am very sick; I don't sleep; I do not know what is the matter\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\nA swiftly passing smile appeared on the thick lips.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I understand, I understand. I am familiar with all this,\r\ntheoretically, of course. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nAt the door he turned around like a little black ball, came back to\r\nthe table and put a book upon it. \"This is my latest book. I came to\r\nbring it to you. Almost forgot. Good-bye.\" (\"b\" like a splash.) The\r\nlittle ball rolled out.\r\n\r\nI am alone. Or, to be more exact, I am _tête-à-tête_ with that\r\nother self. I sit in the armchair and having crossed my legs, I\r\nwatch curiously from some indefinite \"there,\" how I (myself) am\r\nshrivelling in my bed!\r\n\r\nWhy, oh, why is it, that for three years R-, O-, and I were so\r\nfriendly together and now suddenly--one word only about that other\r\nfemale, about I-330, and.... Is it possible that that insanity\r\ncalled love and jealousy does exist not only in the idiotic books of\r\nthe ancients? What seems most strange is that I, I!... Equations,\r\nformulae, figures, and suddenly this! I can't understand it, I\r\ncan't! Tomorrow I shall go to R- and tell him.... No, it isn't\r\ntrue; I shall not go; neither tomorrow nor day after tomorrow, nor\r\never.... I can't, I do not want to see him. This is the end. Our\r\ntriangle is broken up.\r\n\r\nI am alone. It is evening. There is a light fog. The sky is covered\r\nby a thin milky-golden tissue. If I only knew what is there--higher.\r\nIf I only knew who I am. Which I am I?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWELVE\r\n\r\n  The Delimitation of the Infinite\r\n  Angel\r\n  Meditations on Poetry\r\n\r\n\r\nI continue to believe that I shall recover, that I may recover.\r\nI slept very well. No dreams or any other symptoms of disease.\r\nDear O-90 will come tomorrow. Everything will again be simple,\r\nregular and limited like a circle. I am not afraid of this word\r\n\"limited.\" The work of the highest faculty of man, judgment, is\r\nalways directed toward the constant limiting of the infinite,\r\ntoward the breaking up of the infinite into comfortably digestible\r\nportions,--differentials. This is what gives divine beauty to my\r\nelement, mathematics. And it is exactly this beauty that that other\r\nfemale lacks. But this last thought of mine is only an accidental\r\nmental association.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts swarmed in my mind while I was listening to the\r\nregular, rhythmic sounds of the underground railway. Silently I\r\nfollowed the rhythm of its wheels and recited to myself R-'s verses\r\n(from the book which he gave me yesterday), and I felt that behind\r\nme some one was leaning over my shoulder and looking at the open\r\npages. I did not turn around but with the corner of my eye I noticed\r\npink ears, spread like wings, the double-curved ... like the\r\nletter.... It was he, but I did not want to disturb him. I feigned\r\nnot to have noticed him. How he came in, I do not know. I did not\r\nsee him when I got into the car.\r\n\r\nThis incident, insignificant in itself, had an especially good\r\neffect upon me; it invigorated me, I should say. It is pleasant to\r\nfeel that somebody's penetrating eye is watching you from behind\r\nyour shoulder, lovingly guarding you from making the most minute\r\nmistake, from the most minute incorrect step. It may seem to you too\r\nsentimental but I see in all this the materialization of the dream\r\nof the ancients about a Guardian-Angel. How many things about which\r\nthe ancients had only dreams, are materialized in our life!\r\n\r\nAt the moment when I became aware of the presence of the\r\nGuardian-Angel behind me I was enjoying a poem entitled \"Happiness.\"\r\nI think I am not mistaken when I say that it is a piece of rare\r\nbeauty and depth of thought. Here are the first four lines:\r\n\r\n  \"Two times two--eternal lovers;\r\n  Inseparable in passion four ...\r\n  Most flaming lovers in the world,\r\n  Eternally welded, two times two.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the rest is in the same vein: on the wisdom and the eternal\r\nhappiness of the multiplication table. Every poet is inevitably\r\na Columbus. America existed before Columbus for ages, but only\r\nColumbus found it. The multiplication table existed before R-13\r\nfor ages, but only R-13 could find in the virginal forest of\r\nfigures a new Eldorado. Is it not true? Is there any happiness\r\nmore wise and cloudless in this wonderful world? Steel may rust.\r\nThe ancient god created the ancient man, i.e., the man capable\r\nof mistakes, _ergo_ the ancient god himself made a mistake. The\r\nmultiplication table is more wise and more absolute than the ancient\r\ngod, for the multiplication table never (do you understand--_never_)\r\nmakes mistakes! There are no more fortunate and happy people than\r\nthose who live according to the correct, eternal laws of the\r\nmultiplication table. No hesitation! No errors! There is but one\r\ntruth, and there is but one path to it; and that truth is: four,\r\nand that path is: two times two. Would it not seem preposterous for\r\nthese happily multiplied twos suddenly to begin thinking of some\r\nfoolish kind of freedom? i.e. (is it not clear?) of a mistake? It\r\nseems undeniable, axiomatic, that R-13 knows how to grasp the most\r\nfundamental, the most....\r\n\r\nAt that moment again I felt (first near the back of my head, then\r\non my left ear) the warm, tender breath of the Guardian-Angel. He\r\napparently noticed that the book on my lap had long been closed and\r\nthat my thoughts were somewhere very far.... Well, I am ready this\r\nminute to spread before him the pages of my brain. This gives one\r\nsuch a feeling of tranquility and joy. I remember I even turned\r\naround and gazed long and questioningly into his eyes; but either\r\nhe did not understand, or he did not want to understand me. He did\r\nnot ask me anything.... The only thing left for me is to relate\r\neverything to you, my unknown readers. You are to me now as dear and\r\nas near and as far out of reach as he was at that moment.\r\n\r\nThis was my way of thinking: from the part to the whole,--R-13 is\r\nthe part; the whole is our Institution of State Poets and Authors.\r\nI thought: how was it that the ancients did not notice the utter\r\nabsurdity of their prose and poetry? The gigantic, magnificent\r\npower of the artistic word was spent by them in vain. It is really\r\ndroll; anybody wrote whatever happened to come into his head! It\r\nwas as foolish as the fact that in the days of the ancients the\r\nocean blindly splashed at the shore for twenty-four hours without\r\ninterruption or use. The millions of kilogram-meters of energy\r\nwhich were hidden in the waves were used only for the stimulation\r\nof sweethearts! We obtained electricity from the amorous whisper\r\nof the waves! We made a domestic animal out of that sparkling,\r\nfoaming, rabid one! And in the same manner we domesticated and\r\nharnessed the wild element of poetry. Now poetry is no longer the\r\nunpardonable whistling of nightingales but a State Service! Poetry\r\nis a commodity.\r\n\r\nOur famous \"Mathematical Norms\"! Without them in our schools, how\r\ncould we love so sincerely and dearly our four rules of arithmetic?\r\nAnd \"Thorns!\" This is a classical image: the Guardians are thorns\r\nabout a rose; thorns that guard our tender State-Flower from coarse\r\nhands. Whose heart could resist, could remain indifferent to see\r\nand hear the lips of our children recite like a prayer: \"A bad boy\r\ncaught the rose with his hand but the thorn of steel pricked him\r\nlike a needle; the bad boy cried and ran home,\" etc., etc. And the\r\n\"Daily Odes to the Well-Doer!\" Who, having read them, will not\r\nbow piously before the unselfish service of that Number of all\r\nNumbers? And the dreadful red \"Flowers of Court Sentences!\" And the\r\nimmortal tragedy, \"Those Who Come Late to Work!\" And the popular\r\nbook, \"Stanzas on Sex-Hygiene!\"\r\n\r\nOur whole life in all its complexity and beauty is thus stamped\r\nforever in the gold of words. Our poets do not soar any longer in\r\nthe unknown; they have descended to earth and they march with us,\r\nkeeping step to the accompaniment of our austere and mechanical\r\nMarch of the musical State Tower. Their lyre is the morning\r\nrubbing-sound of the electric tooth-brushes, and the threatening\r\ncrack of the electric sparks coming from the Machine of the\r\nWell-Doer, and the magnificent echo of the Hymn of the United State,\r\nand the intimate ringing of the crystalline, shining wash-basins,\r\nand the stimulating rustle of the falling curtains, and the joyous\r\nvoices of the newest cook-books, and the almost imperceptible\r\nwhisper of the street membranes....\r\n\r\nOur gods are here, below. They are with us in the Bureau, in the\r\nkitchen, in the shops, in the rest-rooms. The gods have become like\r\nus, _ergo_ we have become like gods. And we shall come to you, my\r\nunknown readers on another planet, we shall come to you to make your\r\nlife as god-like, as rational and as correct as ours....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n  Fog\r\n  Thou\r\n  A Decidedly Absurd Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\nI awoke at dawn. The rose-colored firmament looked into my eyes.\r\nEverything was beautiful, round. \"O-90 is to come tonight. Surely\r\nI am healthy again.\" I smiled and fell asleep. The Morning Bell!\r\nI got up; everything looked different. Through the glass of the\r\nceiling, through the walls, nothing could be seen but fog,--fog\r\neverywhere, strange clouds, becoming heavier and nearer; the\r\nboundary between earth and sky disappeared. Everything seemed to\r\nbe floating and thawing and falling.... Not a thing to hold to. No\r\nhouses to be seen; they all were dissolved in the fog like crystals\r\nof salt in water. On the sidewalks and inside the houses dark\r\nfigures like suspended particles in a strange milky solution, were\r\nhanging, below, above,--up to the tenth floor. Everything seemed\r\nto be covered with smoke, as though a fire were somewhere raging\r\nnoiselessly.\r\n\r\nAt eleven-forty-five exactly (I looked at the clock particularly at\r\nthat time to catch the figures, to save at least the figures) at\r\neleven-forty-five, just before leaving, according to our Table of\r\nHours, to go and occupy myself with physical labor, I dropped into\r\nmy room for a moment. Suddenly the telephone rang. A voice,--a long\r\nneedle slowly penetrating my heart:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are at home? I am very glad! Wait for me at the corner. We\r\nshall go together.... Where? Well, you'll see.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know perfectly well that I am going to work now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know perfectly well that you'll do as I say! _Au-revoir._ In\r\ntwo minutes!...\"\r\n\r\nI stood at the corner. I had to wait to try to make clear to her\r\nthat only the United State directs me, not she. \"You'll do as I\r\nsay!\" How sure she is! One hears it in her voice. And what if...?\r\n\r\nUnifs, dull gray as if woven of damp fog would appear for a second\r\nat my side and then soundlessly redissolve. I was unable to turn my\r\neyes away from the clock.... I seemed myself to have become that\r\nsharp, quivering hand which marked the seconds. Ten, eight minutes\r\n... three ... two minutes to twelve.... Of course! I was late! Oh,\r\nhow I hated her, yet I had to wait to prove that I....\r\n\r\nA red line in the milky whiteness of the fog--like blood, like a\r\nwound made by a sharp knife--her lips.\r\n\r\n\"I made you wait, I think? And now you are late for your work\r\nanyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"How...? Well, yes, it is too late now.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at her lips in silence. All women are lips, lips only.\r\nSome are rosy lips, tense and round, a ring, a tender fence\r\nseparating one from the world. But these! A second ago they were not\r\nhere, and suddenly ... the slash of a knife! I seemed to see even\r\nthe dripping sweet blood....\r\n\r\nShe came nearer. She leaned gently against my shoulder; we became\r\none. Something streamed from her into me. I felt, I knew, it\r\n_should_ be so. Every fibre of my nervous system told me this, every\r\nhair on my head, every painfully sweet heartbeat. And what a joy it\r\nwas to submit to what _should_ be. A fragment of iron-ore probably\r\nfeels the same joy of submission to precise, inevitable law, when\r\nit clings to a loadstone. The same joy is in a stone which thrown\r\naloft, hesitates a little at the height of its flight and then\r\nrushes down to the ground. It is the same with a man when in his\r\nfinal convulsion he takes a last deep breath and dies.\r\n\r\nI remember I smiled vaguely and said for no reason at all, \"Fog ...\r\nvery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou lovest fog, dost thou?\"\r\n\r\nThis ancient, long-forgotten _thou_--the thou of a master to his\r\nslave--penetrated me slowly, sharply.... Yes, I was a slave.... This\r\ntoo was inevitable, was good.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, good ...\" I said aloud to myself, and then to her, \"I hate\r\nfog. I am afraid of fog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you love it. For if you fear it because it is stronger than\r\nyou, hate it because you fear it, you love it. For you cannot\r\nsubject it to yourself. One loves only the things one cannot\r\nconquer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is so. That is why ... that is precisely why I....\"\r\n\r\nWe were walking--as one. Somewhere beyond the fog the sun was\r\nsinging in a faint tone, gradually swelling, filling the air with\r\ntension and with pearl and gold and rose and red.... The whole world\r\nseemed to be one unembraceable woman, and we who were in her body\r\nwere not yet born; we were ripening in joy. It was clear to me,\r\nabsolutely clear, that everything existed only for me: the sun, the\r\nfog, the gold--for me. I did not ask where we were going; what did\r\nit matter? It was pleasure to walk, to ripen, to become stronger and\r\nmore tense....\r\n\r\n\"Here ...\" I-330 stopped at a door. \"It so happens that today there\r\nis some one on duty who ... I told you about him in the Ancient\r\nHouse.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully guarding the forces ripening within me, I read the sign:\r\n\"Medical Bureau.\" Automatically only I understood.\r\n\r\n... A glass room, filled with golden fog; shelves of glass, colored\r\nbottles, jars, electric wires, bluish sparks in tubes; and a male\r\nNumber--a very thinly flattened man. He might have been cut out of a\r\nsheet of paper. Wherever he was, whichever way he turned, he showed\r\nonly a profile, a sharply pointed, glittering blade of a nose and\r\nlips like scissors.\r\n\r\nI could not hear what I-330 told him; I merely saw her lips when\r\nshe was talking; and I felt that I was smiling, irrepressibly,\r\nblissfully. The scissors-like lips glittered and the doctor said,\r\n\"Yes, yes, I see. A most dangerous disease. I know of nothing more\r\ndangerous.\" And he laughed. With his thin, flat, papery hand he\r\nwrote something on a piece of paper and gave it to I-330; he wrote\r\non another piece of paper and handed it over to me. He had given us\r\ncertificates, testifying that we were ill, that we were unable to go\r\nto work. Thus I stole my work from the United State; I was a thief;\r\nI deserved to be put beneath the Machine of the Well-Doer. Yet I was\r\nindifferent to this thought; it was as distant from me as though it\r\nwere written in a novel. I took the certificate without an instant's\r\nhesitation. I, all my being, my eyes, my lips, my hands ... knew it\r\nwas as it should be.\r\n\r\nAt the corner, from a half empty garage we took an aero. I-330 took\r\nthe wheel as she had done before, pressed the starter and we tore\r\naway from the earth. We soared. Behind us the golden haze; the Sun.\r\nThe thin, blade-like profile of the doctor seemed to me suddenly so\r\ndear, so beloved. Formerly I knew everything was revolving around\r\nthe Sun. Now I knew everything was revolving around me. Slowly,\r\nblissfully, with half-closed eyes....\r\n\r\nAt the gate of the Ancient House we found the same old woman. What\r\na dear mouth, with lips grown together and ray-like wrinkles around\r\nit! Probably those lips have remained grown together all these days;\r\nbut now they parted and smiled:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you mischievous girl, you! Work is too much for you? Well, all\r\nright, all right. If anything happens I'll run up and warn you.\"\r\n\r\nA heavy, squeaky, opaque door. It closed behind us, and at once my\r\nheart opened painfully, widely, still wider.... My lips ... hers....\r\nI drank and drank from them. I tore myself away; in silence I looked\r\ninto her widely open eyes, and then again....\r\n\r\nThe room in half dusk.... Blue and saffron-yellow lights, dark green\r\nmorocco leather, the golden smile of Buddha, a wide mahogany bed,\r\na glimmer of mirrors.... And my dream of a few days before became\r\nso comprehensible, so clear to me; everything seemed saturated\r\nwith the golden prime-juice of life, and it seemed that I was\r\noverflowing with it,--one second more and it would splash out....\r\nLike iron-ore to a loadstone, in sweet submission to the precise\r\nand unchangeable law, inevitably, I clung to her.... There was no\r\npink check, no counting, no United State; I myself was no more.\r\nOnly, drawn together, the tenderly-sharp teeth were there, only her\r\ngolden, widely open eyes, and through them I saw deeper, within....\r\nAnd silence.... Only somewhere in a corner, thousands of miles away\r\nit seemed, drops of water were dripping from the faucet of the\r\nwashstand. I was the Universe!\r\n\r\n... And between drops whole epochs, eras, were elapsing....\r\n\r\nI put on my unif and bent over I-330 to draw her into me with my\r\neyes--for the last time.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it.... I knew you,\" said I-330 in a very low voice. She\r\npassed her hand over her face as though brushing something away;\r\nthen she arose brusquely, put on her unif and her usual sharp,\r\nbite-like smile.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my fallen angel ... you perished just now, do you know that?\r\nNo? You are not afraid? Well, _au-revoir_. You shall go home alone.\r\nWell?\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the mirror-door of the cupboard and looking at me over\r\nher shoulder, she waited. I left the room obediently. Yet no sooner\r\nhad I left the room than I felt it was urgent that she touch me\r\nwith her shoulder--only for one second with her shoulder, nothing\r\nmore. I ran back into the room, where (I presumed) she was standing\r\nbefore the mirror, busy buttoning up her unif; I rushed in and\r\nstopped abruptly. I saw (I remember it clearly), I saw the key\r\nin the keyhole of the closet and the ancient ring upon it was\r\nstill swinging but I-330 was not there. She could not have left\r\nthe room as there was but one exit.... Yet I-330 was not there! I\r\nlooked around everywhere. I even opened the cupboard and felt of the\r\ndifferent ancient dresses; nobody....\r\n\r\nI feel somewhat ridiculous, my dear planetary readers, relating\r\nto you this most improbable adventure. But what else can I do\r\nsince it all happened exactly as I relate it? Was not the whole\r\nday from early morning, full of improbable adventures? Does it not\r\nall resemble the ancient disease of dream-seeing? If this be so,\r\nwhat does it matter if I relate one absurdity more, or one less?\r\nMoreover, I am convinced that sooner or later I shall be able to\r\ninclude all these absurdities in some kind of a logical sequence.\r\nThis thought comforts me as I hope it will comfort you.\r\n\r\n... How overwhelmed I am! If only you knew how overwhelmed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n  \"Mine\"\r\n  Impossible\r\n  A Cold Floor\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall continue to relate my adventures of yesterday. I was busy\r\nduring the personal hour before retiring to bed, and thus I was\r\nunable to record everything last night. But everything is graven in\r\nme; especially, for some reason, and apparently forever, I shall\r\nremember that unbearably cold floor....\r\n\r\nI was expecting O-90 last evening as it was her regular day. I\r\nwent downstairs to the controller on duty to get a permit for the\r\nlowering of my curtains.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you?\" asked the controller. \"You seem so\r\npeculiar tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ... I am sick.\"\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, I told her the truth. I certainly am sick.\r\nAll this _is_ an illness. Presently I remembered; of course, my\r\ncertificate! I touched it in my pocket. Yes, there it was, rustling.\r\nThen all this did happen! It did actually happen!\r\n\r\nI held out the paper to the controller. As I did so, I felt the\r\nblood rushing to my cheeks. Without looking directly at her, I\r\nnoticed with what an expression of surprise she gazed at me.\r\n\r\nThen at twenty-one-thirty o'clock.... In the room to the left the\r\ncurtains were lowered, and in the room to the right my neighbor\r\nwas sitting over a book. His head is bald and covered with bulging\r\nlumps. His forehead is enormous--a yellow parabola. I was walking up\r\nand down the room--suffering. How could I meet her, after all that\r\nhappened! O-90, I mean. I felt plainly to my right, how the eyes of\r\nmy neighbor were staring at me. I clearly saw the wrinkles on his\r\nforehead like a row of yellow, illegible lines; and for some reason\r\nI was certain that those lines dealt with me.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour before twenty-two, the cheerful, rosy whirlwind\r\nwas in my room; the firm ring of her rosy arms closed about my neck.\r\nThen I felt how that ring grew weaker and weaker, and then it broke\r\nand her arms dropped....\r\n\r\n\"You are not the same, not the same man! You are no longer mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"What curious terminology: 'mine.' I never belonged--\" I faltered.\r\nIt suddenly occurred to me: true, I belonged to no one before, but\r\nnow--Is it not clear that now I do not live any more in our rational\r\nworld but in the ancient delirious world, in a world of square-root\r\nof minus one?\r\n\r\nThe curtains fell. There to my right my neighbor let his book drop\r\nat that moment from the table to the floor. And through the last\r\nnarrow space between the curtain and the floor I saw a yellow hand\r\npick up the book. Within I felt: \"Only to seize that hand with all\r\nmy power.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought ... I wanted to meet you during the hour for the walk. I\r\nwanted ... I must talk to you about so many things, so many....\"\r\n\r\nPoor, dear, O-90. Her rosy mouth was a crescent with its horns\r\ndownward. But I could not tell her everything, could I, if for no\r\nother reason than that it would make her an accomplice of my crimes?\r\nI knew that she would not have the courage to report me to the\r\nBureau of Guardians, consequently....\r\n\r\n\"My dear O-, I am sick, I am exhausted. I went again today to the\r\nMedical Bureau; but it is nothing, it will pass. But let us not talk\r\nabout it;--let us forget it.\"\r\n\r\nO-90 was lying down. I kissed her gently. I kissed that childish,\r\nfluffy fold at her wrist. Her blue eyes were closed. The pink\r\ncrescent of her lips was slowly blooming, more and more like a\r\nflower. I kissed her....\r\n\r\nSuddenly I clearly realized how empty I was, how I had given\r\naway.... No, I could not--impossible! I knew I must ... but\r\nno--impossible! I ought ... but no--impossible! My lips cooled at\r\nonce. The rosy crescent trembled, darkened, drew together. O-90\r\ncovered herself with the bedspread, her face hidden in the pillow.\r\n\r\nI was sitting near the bed, on the floor. What a desperately cold\r\nfloor! I sat there in silence. The terrible cold from the floor\r\nrose higher and higher. There in the blue, silent space among the\r\nplanets, there probably it is as cold.\r\n\r\n\"Please understand, dear; I did not mean...\" I muttered, \"With all\r\nmy heart, I ...\"\r\n\r\nIt was the truth. I, my real self did not mean.-- ... Yet how could\r\nI express it in words? How could I explain to her that the piece of\r\niron did not want to.... But that the law is precise, inevitable!\r\n\r\nO-90 lifted her face from the pillow and without opening her eyes\r\nshe said, \"Go away.\" But because she was crying she pronounced it\r\n\"Oo aaa-ay.\" For some reason this absurd detail will not leave my\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nPenetrated by the cold and torpid, I went out into the hall. I\r\npressed my forehead against the cold glass. Outside a thin, almost\r\nimperceptible film of haze was spread. \"Towards night,\" I thought,\r\n\"it will descend again and drown the world. How sad a night it will\r\nbe!\"\r\n\r\nO-90 passed swiftly by, going toward the elevator. The door slammed.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" I screamed. I was frightened.\r\n\r\nBut the elevator was already groaning, going down--down--down....\r\n\r\n\"She robbed me of R-, she robbed me of O-90, yet, yet ...\r\nnevertheless....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD FIFTEEN\r\n\r\n  The Bell\r\n  The Mirror-Like Sea\r\n  I Am To Burn Eternally\r\n\r\n\r\nI was walking upon the dock where the _Integral_ is being built,\r\nwhen the Second Builder came to meet me. His face as usual was round\r\nand white,--a porcelain plate. When he speaks it seems as though he\r\nserves you a plate of something unbearably tasty.\r\n\r\n\"You chose to be ill, and without the Chief we had an accident, as\r\nit were, yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"An accident?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. We finished the bell and started to let it down, and\r\nimagine! the men caught a male without a number. How he got in, I\r\ncannot make out. They took him to the Operation Department. Oh,\r\nthey'll draw the mystery out of the fellow there; 'why' and 'how,'\r\netc....\" He smiled delightedly.\r\n\r\nOur best and most experienced physicians work in the Operation\r\nDepartment under the direct supervision of the Well-Doer himself.\r\nThey have all kinds of instruments, but the best of all is the\r\nGas Bell. The procedure is taken from an ancient experiment of\r\nelementary physics: they used to put a rat under a gas bell and\r\ngradually pump out the air; the air becomes more and more rarified,\r\nand ... you know the rest.\r\n\r\nBut our Gas Bell is certainly a more perfect apparatus and it is\r\nused in combination with different gasses. Furthermore, we don't\r\ntorture a defenseless animal as the ancients did; we use it for a\r\nhigher purpose: to guard the security of the United State, in other\r\nwords, the happiness of millions. About five centuries ago when the\r\nwork of the Operation Department was only beginning, there were\r\nyet to be found some fools who compared our Operation Department\r\nwith the ancient Inquisition. But this is as absurd as to compare\r\na surgeon performing a tracheotomy with a highway cut-throat. Both\r\nuse a knife, perhaps the same kind of a knife, both do the same\r\nthing, viz., cut the throat of a living man, yet one is a well-doer,\r\nthe other is a murderer; one is marked plus, the other minus....\r\nAll this becomes perfectly clear in one second, in one turn of our\r\nlogical wheel, the teeth of which engage that _minus_, turn it\r\nupward and thus change its aspect. That other matter is somewhat\r\ndifferent; the ring in the door was still oscillating, apparently\r\nthe door had just closed, yet she, I-330, had disappeared; she was\r\nnot there! The logical wheel could not turn this fact. A dream? But\r\neven now I feel still in my right shoulder that incomprehensible\r\nsweet pain of I-330 near me in the fog, pressing herself against me.\r\n\"Thou lovest fog?\" Yes, I love the fog too. I love everything and\r\neverything appears to me wonderful, new, tense; everything is so\r\ngood!...\r\n\r\n\"So good,\" I said aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Good?\" The porcelain eyes bulged out. \"What good do you find in\r\nthat? If that man without a number contrived to sneak in, it means\r\nthat there are others around here, everywhere, all the time, here\r\naround the _Integral_, they--\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you mean by 'they'?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know who? But I sense them, all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard about the new operation which has been invented? I\r\nmean the surgical removal of fancy?\" (There really were rumors of\r\nlate about something of the sort.)\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't. What has that to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Merely this: if I were you, I should go and ask to have this\r\noperation performed upon me.\"\r\n\r\nThe plate expressed distinctly something lemon-like, sour. Poor\r\nfellow! He took offence if one even hinted that he might possess\r\nimagination. Well, a week ago I too should have taken offence at\r\nsuch a hint. Not so now, for I know that I have imagination, that is\r\nwhat my illness consists in, and more than that: I know that it is a\r\nwonderful illness,--one does not want to be cured, simply does not\r\nwant to!\r\n\r\nWe ascended the glass steps; the world spread itself below us like\r\nthe palm of a hand.\r\n\r\nYou, readers of these records, whoever you be, you have the sun\r\nabove you. And if you ever were ill, as I am now, then you know\r\nwhat kind of a sun there is or may be in the morning; you know\r\nthat pinkish, lucid, warm gold; the air itself looks a little\r\npinkish; everything seems permeated by the tender blood of the sun;\r\neverything is alive; the stones seem soft and living; iron living\r\nand warm; people all full of life and smiles. It may be that in a\r\nshort while all this will disappear, that in an hour the pinkish\r\nblood of the sun will be drained out, but in the meantime everything\r\nis alive. And I see how something flows and pulsates in the sides of\r\nthe _Integral_; I see the _Integral_ _think_ of its great and lofty\r\nfuture, of the heavy load of inevitable happiness which it is to\r\ncarry up there into the heights, to you, unseen ones, to you who\r\nseek eternally and who never find. You shall find! You shall be\r\nhappy! You must be happy, and you have now not very long to wait!\r\n\r\nThe body of the _Integral_ is almost ready; it is an exquisite,\r\noblong ellipsoid, made of our glass, which is everlasting like\r\ngold and flexible like steel. I watched them within, fixing its\r\ntransverse ribs and its longitudinal stringers; in the stern they\r\nwere erecting the base of the gigantic motor. Every three seconds\r\nthe powerful tail of the _Integral_ will eject flame and gasses\r\ninto the universal space, and the _Integral_ will soar forward and\r\nhigher,--like a flaming Tamerlane of happiness! I watched how the\r\nworkers, true to the Taylor system, would bend down, then unbend\r\nand turn around swiftly and rhythmically like levers of an enormous\r\nengine. In their hands they held glittering glass pipes which\r\nemitted bluish streaks of flame; the glass walls were being cut into\r\nwith flame; with flame there were being welded the angles, the ribs,\r\nthe bars. I watched the monstrous glass cranes easily rolling over\r\nthe glass rails; like the workers themselves they would obediently\r\nturn, bend down and bring their loads inward into the bowels of the\r\n_Integral_. All seemed one, humanized machine and mechanized humans.\r\nIt was the most magnificent, the most stirring beauty, harmony,\r\nmusic!\r\n\r\nQuick! Down! To them, and with them! And I descended and mingled\r\nwith them, fused with their mass, caught in the rhythm of steel and\r\nglass. Their movements were measured, tense and round. Their cheeks\r\nwere colored with health, their mirror-like foreheads not clouded by\r\nthe insanity of thinking. I was floating upon a mirror-like sea. I\r\nwas reposing.... Suddenly one of them turned toward me his care-free\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Well, better today?\"\r\n\r\n\"What better?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were not here yesterday. And we thought something serious....\"\r\nHis forehead was shining; a childish and innocent smile.\r\n\r\nMy blood rushed to my face. No, I could not lie, facing those eyes.\r\nI remained silent; I was drowning.... Above, the shiny round white\r\nporcelain face appeared in the hatchway.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! D-503! Come up here! Something is wrong with a frame and\r\nbrackets here, and ...\"\r\n\r\nNot waiting until he had finished, I rushed to him, upstairs; I was\r\nshamefully saving myself by flight. I had not the power to raise my\r\neyes. I was dazed by the sparkling glass steps under my feet, and\r\nwith every step I made I felt more and more hopeless. I, a corrupted\r\nman, a criminal, was out of place here. No, I shall probably never\r\nagain be able to fuse myself into this mechanical rhythm, nor to\r\nfloat over this mirror-like, untroubled sea. I am to burn eternally\r\nfrom now on, running from place to place, seeking a nook where I may\r\nhide my eyes, eternally, until I.... A spark cold as ice pierced me:\r\n\"I myself, I matter little, but is it necessary that _she_ also...?\r\nI must see that she ...\"\r\n\r\nI crawled through the hatchway to the deck and stood there; where\r\nwas I to go now? I did not know what I had come for! I looked aloft.\r\nThe midday sun exhausted by its march, was fuming dimly. Below was\r\nthe _Integral_, a gray mass of glass,--dead. The pink blood was\r\ndrained out! It was clear to me that all this was my imagination and\r\nthat everything remained as before, yet it was also clear to me that\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you, D-503? Are you deaf? I call you and\r\ncall.... What is the matter with you?\" It was the Second Builder\r\nyelling directly into my ear; he must have been yelling that way for\r\nquite a while.\r\n\r\nWhat was the matter with me? I had lost my rudder, the motor was\r\ngroaning as before, the aero was quivering and rushing on but it\r\nhad no rudder. I did not even know where I was rushing, down to the\r\nearth or up to the sun, to its flame....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD SIXTEEN\r\n\r\n  Yellow\r\n  A Two-dimensional Shadow\r\n  An Incurable Soul\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not written for several days, for I don't know how many.\r\nAll my days are alike. All are of one color,--yellow like dry,\r\noverheated sand. Not a patch of shade, not a drop of water, only an\r\ninfinity of yellow sand. I cannot live without her, but she, since\r\nshe disappeared that day so mysteriously in the Ancient House....\r\n\r\nSince that time I have seen her only once, during the hour for the\r\nWalk, two, three, four days ago, I do not remember exactly. All my\r\ndays are alike. She only passed swiftly by and for a second filled\r\nup the yellow, empty world. With her, arm in arm, reaching not\r\nhigher than her shoulder, were the double-curved S- and the thin\r\npapery doctor, and a fourth person whose fingers only I remember\r\nwell; they streamed out, those fingers, from the sleeve of the\r\nunif like a bundle of rays, uncommonly thin, white, long. I-330\r\nraised her hand and waved to me, then she bent toward the one with\r\nthe ray-like fingers, over the head of S-. I overheard the word\r\n_Integral_. All four turned around to look at me,--and then they\r\ndisappeared in the bluish-gray sea and my road was once more dry and\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThat same evening she had a pink check on me. I stood before the\r\nswitchboard and with hatred and tenderness I implored it to click\r\nand soon to show the number I-330. I would jump out into the hall\r\nat every sound of the elevator. The door of the latter would open\r\nheavily. Pale, tall, blonde and dark they would come out of the\r\nelevator, and here and there curtains were falling.... But she was\r\nnot there. She did not come. And it is quite possible that now, at\r\nthis minute, as I write these lines, at twenty-two o'clock exactly,\r\nwith her eyes closed, she is pressing her shoulder against somebody\r\nelse _in the same way_ and _in the same way_ she may be asking\r\nsomeone: \"Do you love me?\" Whom? Who is he? That one with ray-like\r\nfingers or that thick-lipped, sprinkling R-? Or S-? S-! Why is it\r\nthat I have heard his steps splashing behind me as though in a\r\nditch all these days? Why has he been following me all these days\r\nlike a shadow? Ahead of me, to my side, behind me, a grayish-blue,\r\ntwo-dimensional shadow; people cross it, people step on it but it\r\nremains nearby, attached to me by unseen ties. Perhaps that tie is\r\nI-330. I do not know. Or perhaps they, the Guardians I mean, already\r\nknow that I ...\r\n\r\nIf some one should tell you your shadow sees you, sees you all the\r\ntime, would you understand? All at once peculiar sensations arise\r\nin you; your arms seem to belong to someone else, they are in the\r\nway. That is how I feel; very frequently now I notice how absurdly\r\nI wave my hands without any rhythm. I have an irresistible desire to\r\nglance behind me but I am unable to do so, my neck might as well be\r\nforged of iron. I flee, I run faster and faster, and even with my\r\nback I feel that shadow following me as fast as I can run, and there\r\nis no place to hide myself, no place!\r\n\r\nAt length I reach my room. Alone at last! But here I find another\r\nthing, the telephone. I pick up the receiver. \"Yes, I-330 please.\"\r\nAnd again I hear a light noise through the receiver; some one's step\r\nin the hall there, passing the door of her room, and--silence.... I\r\ndrop the receiver. I cannot, cannot bear it any longer, and I run to\r\nsee her!\r\n\r\nThis happened yesterday. I ran there and for a whole hour from\r\nsixteen to seventeen I wandered near the house in which she lives.\r\nNumbers were passing by in rows. Thousands of feet were beating the\r\ntime like a behemoth with a million legs passing by. I was alone,\r\nthrown out by a storm on an uninhabited island, and my eyes were\r\nseeking and seeking among the grayish-blue waves. \"There soon,\" I\r\nthought, \"will appear from somewhere the sharp mocking angles of the\r\nbrows lifted to the temples, and the dark window-eyes, and there\r\nbehind them a flaming fireplace and someone's shadow.... And I will\r\nrush straight in behind those windows and say to her, 'Thou' (yes,\r\n'thou' without fail), 'Thou knowest I cannot live without thee any\r\nlonger, then why-- ...?'\" But silence reigned.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard the silence; suddenly I heard the Musical Tower\r\nsilenced, and I understood! It was after seventeen already; every\r\none had already left. I was alone. It was too late to return home.\r\nAround me,--a desert made of glass and bathed with yellow sunshine.\r\nI saw, as if in water, the reflection of the walls in the glass\r\nsmoothness of the street, sparkling walls, hanging upside down.\r\nMyself also upside down, hanging absurdly in the glass.\r\n\r\n\"I must go at once, this very second, to the Medical Bureau or else\r\n... or perhaps _this_ would be best: to remain here, to wait quietly\r\nuntil they see me and come and take me into the Operation Department\r\nand put an end to everything at once, redeem everything....\" A\r\nslight rustle! and the double-curved S- was before me. Without\r\nlooking I felt his two gray steel-drill eyes bore quickly into me. I\r\nplucked up all my strength to show a smile and to say (I had to say\r\nsomething), \"I, I must go to the Medical Bureau.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is detaining you? What are you standing here for?\"\r\n\r\nI was silent, absurdly hanging upside down.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me,\" said S- austerely.\r\n\r\nI followed obediently, waving my unnecessary, foreign arms. I could\r\nnot raise my eyes. I walked through a strange world turned upside\r\ndown, where people had their feet pasted to the ceilings, and where\r\nengines stood with their bases upward, and where, still lower, the\r\nsky merged in the heavy glass of the pavement. I remember what\r\npained me most was the fact that looking at the world for the last\r\ntime in my life, I should see it upside down rather than in its\r\nnatural state; but I could not raise my eyes.\r\n\r\nWe stopped. Steps. One step ... and I should see the figures of the\r\ndoctors in their white aprons and the enormous dumb Bell.\r\n\r\nWith force, with some sort of an inner screw, at length I succeeded\r\nin tearing my eyes away from the glass beneath my feet, and I\r\nnoticed the golden letters, \"Medical Bureau.\" Why did he bring me\r\nhere rather than to the Operation Department? Why did he spare\r\nme?--about this I did not even think at that moment. I made one\r\njump over all the steps, firmly closed the door behind me and took\r\na very deep breath, as if I had not breathed since morning and as\r\nif my heart had not beaten for the same length of time, as if only\r\nnow I started to breathe and only now there opened a sluice in my\r\nchest....\r\n\r\nInside there were two of them, one a short specimen with heavy legs,\r\nhis eyes like the horns of a bull tossing the patients up, the other\r\nextremely thin with lips like sparkling scissors, a nose like a\r\nblade--it was the same man who ... I ran to him as to a dear friend,\r\nstraight over close to the blade, and muttered something about\r\ninsomnia, dreams, shadows, yellow sand. The scissors-lips sparkled\r\nand smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it _is_ too bad. Apparently a soul has formed in you.\"\r\n\r\nA soul?--that strange ancient word that was forgotten long ago....\r\n\r\n\"Is it ... v-very dangerous?\" I stuttered.\r\n\r\n\"Incurable,\" was the cut of the scissors.\r\n\r\n\"But more specifically, what is it? Somehow I cannot imagine--\"\r\n\r\n\"You see ... how shall I put it? Are you a mathematician?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you see ... imagine a plane, let us say this mirror. You\r\nand I are on its surface. You see? there we are, squinting our\r\neyes to protect ourselves from the sunlight, or here is the bluish\r\nelectric spark in that tube, there the shadow of that aero that just\r\npassed. All this is on the surface, is momentary only. Now imagine\r\nthis very same surface softened by a flame so that nothing can any\r\nlonger glide over it, so everything instead will penetrate into that\r\nmirror world which excites such curiosity in children. I assure\r\nyou, children are not so foolish as we think they are! The surface\r\nbecomes a volume, a body, a world; and inside the mirror,--within\r\nyou, there is the sunshine, and the whirlwind caused by the aero\r\npropeller, and your trembling lips and someone else's lips also. You\r\nsee, the cold mirror reflects, throws out, while this one absorbs;\r\nit keeps forever a trace of everything that touches it. Once you saw\r\nan imperceptible wrinkle on some one's face, and this wrinkle is\r\nforever preserved within you; you may happen to hear in the silence\r\na drop of water falling,--and you will hear it forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, that is it!\" I grasped his hand. I could hear drops of\r\nwater dripping in the silence from the faucet of a washstand and at\r\nonce I knew it was forever.\r\n\r\n\"But tell me please, why suddenly ... suddenly a soul? There was\r\nnone, yet suddenly.... Why is it that no one has it, yet I....\" I\r\npressed the thin hand; I was afraid to loosen the safety belt.\r\n\r\n\"Why? Well, why don't we grow feathers or wings, but only shoulder\r\nblades, bases for wings? We have aeros; wings would only be in the\r\nway. Wings are needed in order to fly, but we don't need to fly\r\nanywhere. We have arrived at the terminus. We have found what we\r\nwanted. Is that not so?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded vaguely. He glanced at me and laughed a scalpel-like\r\nmetallic laugh. The other doctor overheard us and stamped out of\r\nhis room on his heavy legs. He picked up the thin doctor with his\r\nhorn-eyes, then picked me up.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, a soul? You say a soul? Oh, damn it! We may\r\nsoon retrogress even to the cholera epidemics. I told you,\" he\r\ntossed the thin one on the horns, \"I told you the only thing to do\r\nis to operate on them all, wholesale! simply extirpate the centre\r\nfor fancy. Only surgery can help here, only surgery.\" He put on\r\na pair of enormous X-ray spectacles and remained thus for a long\r\nwhile, looking into my skull, through the bones into my brain and\r\nmaking notes.\r\n\r\n\"Very, very curious! Listen.\" He looked firmly into my eyes. \"Would\r\nyou not consent to have me perform an extirpation on you? It would\r\nbe invaluable to the United State; it might help us to prevent an\r\nepidemic. If you have no special reasons, of course....\"\r\n\r\nSome time ago I should probably have said without hesitation, \"I am\r\nwilling,\" but now,--I was silent. I caught the profile of the thin\r\ndoctor; I implored him!\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said at last, \"Number D-530 is building the _Integral_\r\nand I am sure the operation would interfere....\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah-h!\" grumbled the other and stamped back into his room.\r\n\r\nWe remained alone. The paper-like hand was put lightly and\r\ncaressingly upon mine, the profile-like face came nearer and he said\r\nin a very low voice: \"I shall tell you a secret. You are not the\r\nonly one. My colleague is right when he speaks of an epidemic. Try\r\nto remember, have you not noticed yourself, some one with something\r\nsimilar, very similar, identical?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me closely. What was he alluding to? To whom?... Is it\r\npossible?...\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" I jumped up from my seat. But he had already changed the\r\nsubject. In a loud metallic tone:\r\n\r\n\"... As to the insomnia and for the dreams you complain of, I advise\r\nyou to walk a great deal. Tomorrow morning you must begin taking\r\nlong walks ... say as far as the Ancient House.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he pierced me with his eyes and he smiled thinly. It seemed to\r\nme that I saw enveloped in the tender tissue of that smile a word, a\r\nletter, a name, the only name.... Or was it only my imagination? I\r\nwaited impatiently while he wrote a certificate of illness for today\r\nand tomorrow. Once more I gently and firmly pressed his hand, then I\r\nran out.\r\n\r\nMy heart now feels light and swift like an aero; it carries me\r\nhigher and higher.... I know joy will come tomorrow. What joy?...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD SEVENTEEN\r\n\r\n  Through Glass\r\n  I Died\r\n  The Corridor\r\n\r\n\r\nI am puzzled. Yesterday, at the very moment when I thought\r\neverything was untangled, and that all the X's were at last found,\r\nnew unknowns appeared in my equation. The origin of the coordinates\r\nof the whole story is of course the Ancient Home. From this centre\r\nthe axes of all the X's, Y's, and Z's radiate, and recently they\r\nhave entered into the formation of my whole life.\r\n\r\nI walked along the X-axis (Avenue 59) towards the centre. The\r\nwhirlwind of yesterday still raged within me; houses and people\r\nupside down; my own hands torturingly foreign to me; glimmering\r\nscissors; the sharp sound of drops dripping from the faucet;--all\r\nthis existed, all this _existed_ once! All these things were\r\nrevolving wildly, tearing my flesh, rotating wildly beneath the\r\nmolten surface, there where the \"soul\" is located.\r\n\r\nIn order to follow the instructions of the doctor I chose the road\r\nwhich followed not the hypotenuse but the two legs of a triangle.\r\nSoon I reached the road running along the Green Wall. From beyond\r\nthe Wall, from the infinite ocean of green there rose toward me an\r\nimmense wave of roots, branches, flowers, leaves. It rose higher\r\nand higher; it seemed as though it would splash over me and that\r\nfrom a man, from the finest and most precise mechanism which I am,\r\nI would be transformed into.... But fortunately there was the Green\r\nWall between me and that wild green sea. Oh, how great and divinely\r\nlimiting is the wisdom of walls and bars! This Green Wall is I think\r\nthe greatest invention ever conceived. Man ceased to be a wild\r\nanimal the day he built the first wall; man ceased to be a wild man\r\nonly on the day when the Green Wall was completed, when by this wall\r\nwe isolated our machine-like, perfect world from the irrational,\r\nugly world of trees, birds and beasts....\r\n\r\nThe blunt snout of some unknown beast was to be seen dimly through\r\nthe glass of the Wall; its yellow eyes kept repeating the same\r\nthought which remained incomprehensible to me. We looked into each\r\nother's eyes for a long while. Eyes are shafts which lead from the\r\nsuperficial world into a world which is beneath the surface. A\r\nthought awoke in me: \"what if that yellow-eyed one, sitting there\r\non that absurd dirty heap of leaves, is happier than I, in his life\r\nwhich cannot be calculated in figures!\" I waved my hand. The yellow\r\neyes twinkled, moved back and disappeared in the foliage. What a\r\npitiful being! How absurd the idea that he might be happier! Happier\r\nthan _I_ he may be, but I am an exception, am I not? I am sick.\r\n\r\nI noticed that I was approaching the dark red walls of the Ancient\r\nHouse and I saw the grown-together lips of the old woman. I ran to\r\nher with all speed.\r\n\r\n\"Is she here?\"\r\n\r\nThe grown-together lips opened slowly:\r\n\r\n\"Who is 'she'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? I-330, of course. You remember we came together, she and I, in\r\nan aero the other day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, yes, yes,--yes.\"\r\n\r\nRay-wrinkles around the lips, artful rays radiating from the eyes.\r\nThey were making their way deeper and deeper into me.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she is here, all right. Came in a while ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" I noticed at the feet of the old woman a bush of\r\nsilver,--bitter wormwood. (The court of the Ancient House, being a\r\npart of the museum is carefully kept in its prehistoric state.) A\r\nbranch of the bush touched the old woman, she caressed that branch;\r\nupon her knees lay stripes of sunshine. For a second I myself, the\r\nsun, the old woman, the wormwood, those yellow eyes, all seemed to\r\nbe one; we were firmly united by common veins and one common blood,\r\nboisterous, magnificent blood, was running through those veins.\r\n\r\nI am ashamed now to write down all this, but I promised to be frank\r\nto the end of these records: yes, I bent over and kissed that soft,\r\ngrown-together mouth of the old woman. She wiped it with her hand\r\nand laughed.\r\n\r\nRunning, I passed through familiar, half-dark, echoing rooms, and\r\nfor some reason I ran straight to the bedroom. When I had reached\r\nthe door, a thought flashed: \"And if she is there ... not alone?\" I\r\nstopped and listened. But all I heard was the tick-tock of my heart,\r\nnot within me, but somewhere near, outside me.\r\n\r\nI entered. The large bed,--untouched. A mirror ... another mirror\r\nin the door of the cupboard, and in the keyhole an ancient key upon\r\nan ancient ring. No one was there. I called softly: \"I-330, are you\r\nhere?\"--and then in a still lower voice with closed eyes, holding\r\nmy breath,--in a voice as though I were kneeling before her, \"I-,\r\ndear.\" Silence. Only the water was dripping fast into the white\r\nbasin of the washstand. I cannot now explain why, but I disliked\r\nthat sound. I turned the faucet hard and went out. She was not\r\nthere, so much was clear. She must be in another \"apartment.\"\r\n\r\nI ran down a wide, sombre stairway, pulled one door, another, a\r\nthird,--locked. Every room was locked save that of \"our\" apartment.\r\nAnd she was not there. I went back again to the same apartment\r\nwithout knowing why. I walked slowly, with difficulty; my shoe-soles\r\nsuddenly became as heavy as cast-iron. I remember distinctly my\r\nthought, \"It is a mistake that the force of gravity is a constant;\r\nconsequently all my formulae....\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly--an explosion! A door slammed down below; some one stamped\r\nquickly over the flagstones. I again became lightfooted, extremely\r\nlight! I dashed to the railing to bend over, and in one word, one\r\nexclamation, expressed everything: \"You!\"\r\n\r\nI became cold. Below in the square shadow of the window-frame,\r\nflapping its pink wing-ears, the head of S- passed by!\r\n\r\nLike lightning I saw only the naked conclusion. Without any premises\r\n(I don't recall any premises even now) the conclusion: he must not\r\nsee me here! And on the tips of my toes, pressing myself against the\r\nwall, I sneaked upstairs into the unlocked apartment.\r\n\r\nI stopped for a second at the door. He was stamping upward, here. If\r\nonly the door.... I prayed to the door but it was a wooden one,--It\r\nsqueaked, it squealed. Like a wind something red passed my eyes,\r\nsomething green, and the yellow Buddha. In front of the mirror-door\r\nof the cupboard, my pale face; my ears still following those steps,\r\nmy lips.... Now _he_ was already passing the green and yellow, now\r\nhe was passing Buddha, now at the doorsill of the bedroom....\r\n\r\nI grasped the key of the cupboard; the ring oscillated. This\r\noscillation reminded me of something. Again a conclusion, a naked\r\nconclusion without premises; a conclusion, or to be more exact, a\r\nfragment of one: \"Now I-330 is....\" I brusquely opened the cupboard\r\nand when inside in the darkness shut the door firmly. One step! The\r\nfloor shook under my feet. Slowly and softly I floated somewhere\r\ndownward; my eyes were dimmed,--I died!\r\n\r\nLater when I sat down to describe all these adventures, I sought in\r\nmy memory and consulted some books; and now I understand, of course!\r\nI was in a state of temporary death. This state was known to the\r\nancients, but as far as I am informed it is unknown to us. I have\r\nno conception of how long I was dead, probably not longer than five\r\nor ten seconds, but after awhile I arose from the dead and opened\r\nmy eyes. It was dark. But I felt I was falling down--down--down. I\r\nstretched out my hand to attach myself to something but the rough\r\nwall scratched my fingers; it was running away from me, upward. I\r\nfelt blood on my fingers. It was clear that all this was not merely\r\na play of my sick imagination. But what was it? What?\r\n\r\nI heard my own frequent, trembling breaths. (I am not ashamed to\r\nconfess this, it was all unexpected and incomprehensible.) A minute,\r\ntwo, three passed; I was still going down. Then a soft bump. The\r\nthing that had been falling away from under my feet was motionless.\r\nI found in the darkness a knob, and turned it; a door opened;\r\nthere was a dim light. I now noticed behind me a square platform,\r\ntravelling upward. I tried to run back to it but it was too late. \"I\r\nam cut off here,\" I thought. Where \"here\" might be, I did not know.\r\n\r\nA corridor. A heavy silence. The small lamps on the vaulted ceiling\r\nresembled an endless, twinkling, dotted line. The corridor was\r\nsimilar to the \"tube\" of our underground railways but it was much\r\nnarrower, and made not of our glass but of some other, very ancient\r\nmaterial. For a moment I thought of the underground caves where they\r\nsay many tried to save themselves during the Two Hundred Years' War.\r\nThere was nothing to do but to walk ahead.\r\n\r\nI walked, I think, for about twenty minutes. A turn to the right,\r\nthe corridor became wider, the small lamps brighter. There was a\r\ndim droning somewhere.... Was it a machine or voices? I did not\r\nknow. I stood before a heavy, opaque door, from behind which came\r\nthe noise. I knocked. Then I knocked again, louder. Now there was\r\nsilence behind the door. Something clanked; the door opened slowly\r\nand heavily.\r\n\r\nI don't know which of us was the more dumbfounded; the thin\r\nblade-like doctor stood before me!\r\n\r\n\"You here!\" his scissors opened and remained open.\r\n\r\nAnd I, as if I did not know a human word, stood silent, merely\r\nstared, without comprehending that he was talking to me. He must\r\nhave told me to leave, for with his thin paper stomach he slowly\r\npressed me to the side, to the more brightly lighted end of the\r\ncorridor and poked me in the back.\r\n\r\n\"Beg your pardon ... I wanted ... I thought that she, I-330 ... but\r\nbehind me....\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay where you are,\" said the doctor brusquely, and he disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt last! At last she was nearby, here, and what did it matter where\r\n\"here\" was? I saw the familiar saffron-yellow silk, the smile-bite,\r\nthe eyes with their curtains drawn.... My lips quivered, so did my\r\nhands and knees, and I had a most stupid thought: \"Vibrations make\r\nsounds. Shivering must make a sound. Why then don't I hear it?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes opened for me widely. I entered into them.\r\n\r\n\"I could not ... any longer!... Where have you been?... Why?...\"\r\n\r\nI was unable to tear my eyes away from her for a second, and I\r\ntalked as if in a delirium, fast and incoherently, or perhaps I\r\nonly thought without speaking out: \"A shadow ... behind me. I died.\r\nAnd from the cupboard.... Because that doctor of yours ... speaks\r\nwith his scissors.... I have a soul ... incurable ... and I must\r\nwalk....\"\r\n\r\n\"An incurable soul? My poor boy!\" I-330 laughed. She covered me\r\nwith the sparkles of her laughter; my delirium left me. Everywhere\r\naround her little laughs were sparkling! How good it was!\r\n\r\nThe doctor reappeared from around the turn, the wonderful,\r\nmagnificent, thinnest doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" He was already beside her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing. I shall tell you later. He got here by\r\naccident. Tell them that I shall be back in about a quarter of an\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor slid around the corner. She lingered. The door closed\r\nwith a heavy thud. Then slowly, very slowly, piercing my heart with\r\na sharp sweet needle, I-330 pressed against me with her shoulder and\r\nthen with her arm, with her whole body, and we walked away as if\r\nfused into one.\r\n\r\nI do not remember now where we turned into darkness; in the darkness\r\nwe walked up some endless stairway in silence. I did not see but I\r\nknew, I knew that she walked as I did, with closed eyes, blind, her\r\nhead thrown a little backward, biting her lips and listening to the\r\nmusic, that is to say, to my almost audible tremor.\r\n\r\nI returned to consciousness in one of the innumerable nooks in the\r\ncourtyard of the Ancient House. There was a fence of earth with\r\nnaked stone ribs and yellow teeth of walls half fallen to pieces.\r\nShe opened her eyes and said, \"Day-after-tomorrow at sixteen.\" She\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nDid all this really happen? I do not know. I shall learn\r\nday-after-tomorrow. One real sign remains: on my right hand the\r\nskin has been rubbed from the tips of three fingers. But today, on\r\nthe _Integral_ the Second Builder assured me that he saw me touch\r\nthe polishing wheel with those very same fingers. Perhaps I did. It\r\nis quite probable. I don't know. I don't know anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\n  Logical Debris\r\n  Wounds and Plaster\r\n  Never Again\r\n\r\n\r\nLast night as soon as I had gone to bed, I fell momentarily to the\r\nbottom of the ocean of sleep like an overloaded ship which has been\r\nwrecked. The heavy thicket of wavy green water enveloped me. Then\r\nslowly I floated from the bottom upward, and somewhere in the middle\r\nof that course, I opened my eyes,--my room! The morning was still\r\ngreen and motionless. A fragment of sunshine coming from the mirror\r\non my closet door shone into my eyes. This fragment does not permit\r\nme to sleep, being thus an obstacle in the way of exactly fulfilling\r\nthe rules of the Tables which prescribe so many hours of sleep.\r\nI should have opened the closet but I felt as though I were in a\r\nspider web, and cobweb covered my eyes; I had no power to sit up.\r\n\r\nYet I got up and opened the closet door; suddenly, there behind that\r\ndoor, making her way through the mass of garments which hung there,\r\nwas I-330! I have become so accustomed of late to most improbable\r\nthings, that as far as I remember I was not even surprised; I did\r\nnot even ask a question. I jumped into the closet, slammed the\r\nmirror-door behind me and breathlessly, brusquely, blindly, avidly I\r\nclung to her. I remember clearly even now:--through the narrow crack\r\nof the door a sharp sun-ray like lightning broke into the darkness\r\nand played on the floor and walls of the closet, and a little higher\r\nthe cruel ray-blade fell upon the naked neck of I-330, and this for\r\nsome reason seemed to me so terrible that I could not bear it, and I\r\nscreamed;--and again I opened my eyes. My room!\r\n\r\nThe morning was still green and motionless. On the door of my closet\r\nwas a fragment of the sunshine. I was in bed. A dream? Yet my heart\r\nwas still wildly beating, quivering and twitching; there was a dull\r\npain in the tips of my fingers and in my knees. _This_ undoubtedly\r\n_did_ happen! And now I am unable any more to distinguish what is\r\ndream from what is actuality; irrational numbers grow through my\r\nsolid, habitual, tri-dimensional life; and instead of firm, polished\r\nsurfaces--there is something shaggy and rough....\r\n\r\nI waited long for the Bell to ring. I was lying thinking, untangling\r\na very strange logical chain. In our superficial life, every\r\nformula, every equation, corresponds to a curve or a solid. We\r\nhave never seen any curve or solid corresponding to my square-root\r\nof minus one. The horrifying part of the situation is that there\r\nexist such curves or solids; unseen by us they do exist, they\r\nmust, inevitably; for in mathematics as on a screen, strange sharp\r\nshadows appear before us. One must remember that mathematics like\r\ndeath, never makes mistakes, never plays tricks. If we are unable\r\nto see those irrational curves or solids, it only means that they\r\ninevitably possess a whole immense world somewhere beneath the\r\nsurface of our life....\r\n\r\nI jumped up without waiting for the waking Bell and began to pace\r\nup and down the room. My mathematics, the only firm and immovable\r\nisland of my shaken life, this too was torn from its anchor and\r\nwas floating, whirling. Then it means that that absurd thing, the\r\n\"soul,\" is as real as my unif, as my boots, although I do not see\r\nthem since they are behind the door of the closet. If boots are not\r\na sickness, why should the \"soul\" be one? I sought, but I could not\r\nfind, a way out of the logical confusion. It looked to me like that\r\nstrange and sad debris beyond the Green Wall; my logical debris\r\ntoo, is filled with extraordinary, incomprehensible, wordless\r\nbut speaking beings. It occurred to me for a moment that through\r\nsome strange, thick glass I saw _it_; I saw it at once infinitely\r\nlarge and infinitely small, scorpion-like with hidden but ever\r\nperceptible sting; I _saw_ the square-root of minus one. Perhaps it\r\nwas nothing else but my \"soul,\" which like the legendary scorpion of\r\nthe ancients, was voluntarily stinging itself with....\r\n\r\nThe Bell! The day began. All I saw and felt neither died, nor\r\ndisappeared, it merely became covered with daylight, as our visible\r\nworld does not die or disappear at the end of the day but merely\r\nbecomes covered with the darkness of night. My head was filled by\r\na light, thin haze. Through that haze I perceived the long glass\r\ntables and the globe-like heads busy chewing, slowly, silently,\r\nin unison. At a distance, through the haze, the metronome was\r\nslowly beating its tick-tock, and to the accompaniment of this\r\ncustomary and caressing music I joined with the others in counting\r\nautomatically to fifty: fifty is the number of chewing movements\r\nrequired by the law of the State for every piece of food. And\r\nautomatically then, keeping time, I went downstairs and put my\r\nname down in the book for the outgoing Numbers,--as everyone did.\r\nBut I felt I _lived_ separately from everybody; I lived by myself\r\nseparated by a soft wall which absorbs noises; beyond that wall\r\nthere was my world.\r\n\r\nHere a thought occurred to me. If that world is only my own, why\r\nshould I tell about it in these records? Why should I recount\r\nall these absurd \"dreams\" about closets, endless corridors? With\r\ngreat sorrow I notice that instead of a correct and strictly\r\nmathematical poem in honor of the United State, I am writing a\r\nfantastic novel. Oh! if only it were a novel and not my actual life,\r\nfull of X's, square-roots of minus one and down-fallings! Yet all\r\nmay be for the best. Probably you, my unknown readers, are children\r\nstill as compared with us. We are brought up by the United State;\r\nconsequently we have reached the highest summits attainable by man.\r\nAnd you, being children, may swallow without crying all the bitter\r\nthings I am to give you only if they be coated with the syrup of\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\n  * * * * *\r\n\r\n_The Same Evening_\r\n\r\nAre you familiar with the following sensation? You are in an aero\r\nand you dash upward along a blue spiral line; the window is open and\r\nthe wind rushes past your face, whistling. There is no earth. The\r\nearth is forgotten. The earth is as far from you as Venus, Saturn\r\nor Jupiter. That is how I live now. A hurricane wind beats into my\r\nface; I forget the earth, forget rosy, dear O-90. Yet the earth does\r\nexist and sooner or later I must plane down to that earth; only I\r\nclose my eyes to avoid seeing the date at which there is the name\r\nO-90 written on my Tables.\r\n\r\nThis evening the distant earth reminded me of itself. In order to\r\nfulfill the recommendation of the doctor (I desire sincerely, most\r\nsincerely I desire to be cured), I wandered for two hours and eight\r\nminutes over the straight lines of the deserted avenues. Everybody\r\nwas in the auditoriums, in accordance with the Table. Only I, cut\r\noff from the rest, I was alone. Strictly speaking, it was a very\r\nunnatural situation. Imagine a finger cut off from the whole, from\r\nthe hand; a separate human finger, somewhat hunched, running over\r\nthe glass sidewalk. I was such a finger. What seemed most strange\r\nand unnatural was that the finger had no desire to be with its\r\nhand, with its fellows. I want either to be alone or with _her_;\r\nto transfuse my whole being into hers through a contact with her\r\nshoulder or through our interwoven fingers.\r\n\r\nI came home as the sun was setting. The pink dust of evening was\r\ncovering the glass of the walls, the golden peak of the Accumulating\r\nTower, the voices and smiles of the Numbers. Is it not strange: the\r\npassing rays of the evening sun fall to the earth at the same angle\r\nas the awakening rays of the morning, yet they make everything seem\r\nso different; the pink tinge is different. At sunset it is so quiet,\r\nsomewhat melancholy; at sunrise it is resounding, boisterous.\r\n\r\nIn the hall downstairs when I entered, I saw U-, the controller. She\r\ntook a letter from the heaps of envelopes covered with pink dust and\r\nhanded it to me. I repeat: she is a very respectable woman and I am\r\nsure she has only the very best feelings towards me.... Yet, every\r\ntime I see those cheeks hanging down, which look like the gills of a\r\nfish, I....\r\n\r\nHolding out her dry hand with the letter, U- sighed. But that sigh\r\nonly very slightly moved in me the curtains which separate me from\r\nthe rest of the world. I was completely projected upon the envelope\r\nwhich trembled in my hand. I had no doubt but that it was a letter\r\nfrom I-330.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I heard another sigh, such a deliberate one,\r\nunderscored with two lines, that I raised my eyes from the envelope\r\nand saw a tender, cloudy smile coming from between the gills,\r\nthrough the bashful jalousies of lowered eyes. And then:\r\n\r\n\"You poor, poor, dear!...\" a sigh underscored with three lines, and\r\na glance at the letter, an imperceptible glance. (What was in the\r\nletter she naturally knew, _ex officio_.)\r\n\r\n\"No, really?... Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, dear, I know better than you. For a long time I have\r\nwatched you and I see that you need some one with years of\r\nexperience of life to accompany you.\"\r\n\r\nI felt all pasted around by her smile. It was like a plaster upon\r\nthe wounds which were to be inflicted upon me by the letter I held\r\nin my hand. Finally, through the bashful jalousies of her eyes, she\r\nsaid in a very low voice: \"I shall think about it, dear. I shall\r\nthink it over. And be sure that if I feel myself strong enough ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Well-Doer! Is it possible that my lot is?... Is it possible\r\nthat she means to say, that she?...\"\r\n\r\nMy eyes were dimmed and filled with thousands of sinusoids; the\r\nletter was trembling. I went near the light, to the wall. There the\r\nlight of the sun was going out; from the sun was falling thicker and\r\nthicker the dark, sad, pink dust, covering the floor, my hands, the\r\nletter. I opened the envelope and found the signature as fast as I\r\ncould,--the first wound! It was not I-330; it was O-90! And another\r\nwound: in the right-hand corner a slovenly splash,--a blot! I cannot\r\nbear blots. It matters little whether they are made by ink or by ...\r\nwell, it matters not by what. Heretofore, such a blot would have had\r\nonly a disagreeable effect, disagreeable to the eyes; but now--why\r\ndid that small gray blot seem to be like a cloud and seem to spread\r\nabout me a leaden, bluish darkness? Or was it again the \"soul\" at\r\nwork? Here is a transcript of the letter:\r\n\r\n\"You know, or perhaps you don't ... I cannot write well. Little it\r\nmatters! Now you know that without you there is for me not a single\r\nday, a single morning, a single spring, for R- is only ... well,\r\nthat is of no importance to you. At any rate, I am very grateful\r\nto him, for without him, alone all these days, I don't know what\r\nwould.... During these last few days and nights I have lived through\r\nten years, or perhaps twenty years. My room seemed to me not square\r\nbut round; I walk around without end, round after round, always the\r\nsame thing, not a door to escape through. I cannot live without\r\nyou because I love you; and I should not, I cannot be with you any\r\nmore,--because I love you! Because I see and I understand that you\r\nneed no one now, no one in the world save that other, and you must\r\nrealize that it is precisely because I love you I must ...\r\n\r\n\"I need another two or three days in order to paste together the\r\nfragments of myself and thus restore at least something similar to\r\nthe O-90 of old. Then I shall go myself, and myself I shall state\r\nthat I take your name from my list, and this will be better for you;\r\nyou must feel happy now. I shall never again....\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, O-.\"\r\n\r\nNever again. Yes, that is better. She is right. But, why then?...\r\nWhy then?...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD NINETEEN\r\n\r\n  The Infinitesimal of the Third Order\r\n  From Under the Forehead\r\n  Over the Railing\r\n\r\n\r\nThere in the strange corridor lighted by the dotted line of dim\r\nlittle electric lamps ... or no, no, later, when we had already\r\nreached one of the nooks in the courtyard of the Ancient House, she\r\nsaid, \"Day-after-tomorrow.\" That \"day-after-tomorrow\" is today. And\r\neverything seems to have wings and to fly; the day flies; and our\r\n_Integral_ too already has wings. We finished placing the motor\r\nand tried it out today, without switching it in. What magnificent,\r\npowerful salvos! Each of them sounded for me like a salute in honor\r\nof _her_, the only one,--in honor of today!\r\n\r\nAt the time of the first explosion about a dozen loafing Numbers\r\nfrom the docks stood near the main tube--and nothing was left of\r\nthem save a few crumbs and a little soot. With pride I write down\r\nnow that this occurrence did not disturb the rhythm of our work even\r\nfor a second. Not a man shrank. We and our lathes continued our\r\nrectilinear or curved motions with the same sparkling and polished\r\nprecision as before, as if nothing had happened. As a matter of\r\nfact, what did happen? A dozen Numbers represent hardly one hundred\r\nmillionth part of the United State. For practical consideration,\r\nthat is but an infinitesimal of the third order. That _pity_, a\r\nresult of arithmetical ignorance, was known to the ancients; to us\r\nit seems absurd.\r\n\r\nIt seems droll to me also, that yesterday I was thinking, even\r\nrelating in these pages about a gray blot! All that was only the\r\n\"softening of the surface\" which is normally as hard as diamond,\r\nlike our walls. (There is an ancient saying: \"Shooting beans at a\r\nstone wall--\")\r\n\r\nSixteen o'clock. I did not go for the supplementary walk; who knows,\r\nshe might come now, when the sun is so noisily bright.\r\n\r\nI am almost the only one in his room. Through the walls full of\r\nsunshine I see for a distance to the right and to the left and below\r\nstrings of other rooms, repeating each other as if in a mirror,\r\nhanging in the air and empty. Only on the bluish stairway, striped\r\nby the golden ink of the sun, is seen rising a thin, gray shadow.\r\nAlready I hear steps, and I see through the door and I feel a smile\r\npasted to my face like a plaster. But it passed to another stairway\r\nand down. The click of the switchboard! I threw myself to that\r\nlittle white slit and ... an unfamiliar male Number! (A consonant\r\nmeans a male Number.)\r\n\r\nThe elevator groaned and stopped. A big, slovenly, slanting forehead\r\nstood before me, and the eyes ... They impressed me strangely; it\r\nseemed as if the man talked with his eyes which were deep under the\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a letter from her, for you.\" (From under the awning of that\r\nforehead.) \"She asked that everything ... as requested in the letter\r\n... without fail.\" This too, from under the forehead, from under the\r\nawning, and he turned, looked about.\r\n\r\n\"No, there is nobody, nobody. Quickly! the letter!\"\r\n\r\nHe put the letter in my hand and went out without a word.\r\n\r\nA pink check fell out of the envelope. It was hers, _her_ check! Her\r\ntender perfume! I felt like running to catch up with that wonderful\r\nunder-the-forehead one. A tiny note followed the check from the\r\nenvelope; three lines: \"The check ... Lower the curtains without\r\nfail, as if I were actually with you. It is necessary that they\r\nshould think that I ... I am very, very sorry.\"\r\n\r\nI tore the note into small bits. A glance at the mirror revealed\r\nmy distorted, broken eyebrows. I took the check and was ready to\r\ndo with it as I had done with the note. \"She asked that everything\r\n... as requested in the letter ... without fail.\" My arms weakened\r\nand the hands loosened. The check was back on the table. She _is_\r\nstronger than I, stronger than I. It seemed as though I were going\r\nto act as she wished. Besides ... however, it is a long time before\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe check remained on the table. In the mirror--my distorted, broken\r\neyebrows. Oh, why did I not have a doctor's certificate for today? I\r\nshould like to go and walk, walk without end around the Green Wall\r\nand then to fall on my bed ... to the bottom of.... Yet I had to go\r\nto Auditorium No. 13, and I should have to grip myself, so as to\r\nbear up for two hours! Two hours without motion, at a time when I\r\nwanted to scream and stamp my feet!\r\n\r\nThe lecture was on. It was very strange to hear from the sparkling\r\ntube of the phono-lecturer not the usual metallic voice but a soft,\r\nvelvety, mossy one. It was a woman's voice and I seemed to have a\r\nvision of the woman: a little hook-like old woman, like the one of\r\nthe Ancient House.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient House! Suddenly from within me a powerful fountain\r\nof.... I had to use all my strength to control myself, so as not to\r\nfill the auditorium with screams. The soft mossy words were piercing\r\nme, yet only empty words about children and child-production reached\r\nmy ear. I was like a photographic plate: everything was making\r\nits imprint with a strange, senseless precision on me; the golden\r\nscythe which was nothing more than the reflection of light from the\r\nmegaphone of the lecture apparatus, under the megaphone a child,\r\na living illustration. It was leaning toward the megaphone, the\r\nangle of its infinitesimal unif in its mouth, its little fist\r\nclenched firmly, its thumb squeezed into the fist, a light fluffy\r\npleat of skin at the wrist. Like a photographic plate I was taking\r\nthe impression of all this. Now I saw how its naked leg hung over\r\nthe edge of the platform, the pink fan of its finger waved in the\r\nair.... One minute more, one second and the child would be on the\r\nfloor!\r\n\r\nA female's scream, a wave of translucent wings, her unif on the\r\nplatform! She caught the child, her lips clung to the fluffy pleat\r\nof the baby's wrist; she moved the child to the middle of the\r\ntable and left the platform. The imprints were registering in\r\nme: a pink crescent of a mouth, the horns downward! Eyes like\r\nsmall blue saucers filled with liquid! It was O-90. And as if\r\nreading a consequential formula, I suddenly felt the necessity, the\r\nnaturalness of that insignificant occurrence.\r\n\r\nShe sat down behind me, somewhat to my left. I looked back.\r\nShe quietly removed her gaze from the table and the child and\r\nlooked straight into me. Within again: She, I, the table on the\r\nplatform,--three points: and through those three points lines were\r\ndrawn, a projection of some as yet unforeseen events!\r\n\r\nThen I went home through the green dusky street which seemed\r\nmany-eyed because of the electric lights. I heard myself\r\ntick-tocking like a clock. And the hands of that clock seemed to be\r\nabout to pass a figure: I was going to do something, something that\r\nwould cut off every way of retreat. She wants somebody, whom I do\r\nnot know, to think she is with me. I want her; what do I care what\r\n_she_ wants? I do not want to be alone behind the curtains and that\r\nis all there is to it!\r\n\r\nFrom behind came sounds of a familiar gait, like splashing in a\r\nditch. I did not need to look back, I knew it was S-. He would\r\nfollow me to the very door, probably. Then he would stay below on\r\nthe sidewalk, and he would try to drill upward into my room with his\r\nboring eyes, until the curtains would fall, concealing something\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nWas he my Guardian-Angel? No! My decision was made.\r\n\r\nWhen I came into my room and turned on the light, I could not\r\nbelieve my eyes! O-90 stood at my table, or to be more exact,\r\nshe was hanging like a creased empty dress. She seemed to have\r\nno tensity, no spring beneath the dress; her arms and legs were\r\nspringless, her voice was hanging and springless.\r\n\r\n\"About my letter, did you receive it? Yes? I must know your answer,\r\nI must--today.\"\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. I enjoyed looking into her blue eyes which\r\nwere filled with tears as if she were the guilty one. I lingered\r\nover my answer. With pleasure I pricked her:\r\n\r\n\"Answer? Well.... You are right. Undoubtedly. In everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then ...\" (She tried to cover the minute tremor with a smile but\r\nit did not escape me.) \"Well, all right. I shall ... I shall leave\r\nyou at once.\"\r\n\r\nYet she remained drooping over the table. Drooping eyelids, drooping\r\narms and legs. The pink check of the other was still on the table. I\r\nquickly opened this manuscript, \"WE,\" and with its pages I covered\r\nthe check, trying to hide it from myself, rather than from O-.\r\n\r\n\"See, here, I am still busy writing. Already 101 pages! Something\r\nquite unexpected comes out in this writing.\"\r\n\r\nIn a voice, in a shadow of a voice, \"And do you remember ... how the\r\nother day I ... on the _seventh_ page ... and it dropped....\"\r\n\r\nThe tiny blue saucers filled to the borders; silently and rapidly\r\nthe tears ran down her cheeks. And suddenly, like the dropping of\r\nthe tears,--rushing forth,--words:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot ... I shall leave you in a moment. I shall never again ...\r\nand I don't care.... Only I want, I must have a child! From you!\r\nGive me a child and I will leave. I will!\"\r\n\r\nI saw she was trembling all over beneath her unif, and I felt ...\r\nI too, would soon ... would.... I put my hands behind my back and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"What? You desire to go under the Machine of the Well-Doer?\"\r\n\r\nLike a stream her words ran over the dam.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care. I shall feel it for a while within me. I want to see,\r\nto see only once the little fold of skin here at the wrist, like\r\nthat one on the table in the Auditorium. Only for one day!\"\r\n\r\nThree points: she, I and a little fist with a fluffy fold of skin\r\nthere on the table!\r\n\r\nI remember how once when I was a child they took me up on the\r\nAccumulating Tower. At the very top I bent over the glass railing\r\nof an opening in the Tower. Below people seemed like dots; my heart\r\ncontracted sweetly. \"What if....\" On that occasion I only clenched\r\nmy hands around the railing; now I jumped over.\r\n\r\n\"So you desire ... being perfectly aware that ...\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were closed as if the sun were beating straight into her\r\nface. A wet, shining smile!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! I want it!\"\r\n\r\nQuickly I took out the pink check of the other from under the\r\nmanuscript and down I went to the controller on duty. O-90 caught\r\nmy hand, screamed out something, but what it was I understood only\r\nlater, when I returned.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on the edge of the bed, hands firmly clasped about\r\nthe knees.\r\n\r\n\"Is it, is it her check?\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter? Well, it is hers, yes.\"\r\n\r\nSomething cracked. It must have been the springs of the bed, for\r\nO-90 made a slight motion only. She remained sitting, her hands upon\r\nher knees.\r\n\r\n\"Well, quick....\" I roughly pressed her hand. A red spot was left\r\non her wrist (tomorrow it would become purple), where the fluffy,\r\ninfantile fold.... It was the last.... I turned the switch, my\r\nthoughts went out with the light. Darkness, a spark! and I had\r\njumped over the railing, down....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY\r\n\r\n  Discharge\r\n  The Material of a Idea\r\n  The Zero Rock\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discharge_ is the best word for it. Now I see that it was actually\r\nlike an electric discharge. The pulse of my last few days had been\r\nbecoming dryer and dryer, more and more frequent, more intense.\r\nThe opposite poles had been drawing nearer and nearer and already\r\nI could hear the dry crackling; one millimeter more, and--an\r\nexplosion! Then silence.\r\n\r\nWithin me there is quiet now and emptiness like that of a house\r\nafter everybody has left, when one lies ill, all alone and hears so\r\nclearly the distinct, metallic, tick-tock of thoughts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that \"discharge\" cured me at last of my torturing \"soul.\"\r\nAgain I am like all of us. At least at this moment as I write, I\r\ncan see as it were, without any pain in my mental eye, how O-90 is\r\nbrought to the steps of the Cube; or I see her in the Gas Bell. And\r\nif there in the Operation Department she should give my name,--I do\r\nnot care. Piously and gratefully I should kiss the punishing hand\r\nof the Well-Doer at the last moment. I have this right in regard to\r\nthe United State: to receive my punishment. And I shall not give up\r\nthis right. No Number ought, or dares, to refuse this only personal,\r\nand therefore, most precious, privilege.\r\n\r\n... Quickly, metallically, distinctly, do the thoughts rap in the\r\nhead. An invisible aero carries me into the blue height of my\r\nbeloved abstractions. And I see how there in the height, in the\r\npurest rarified air, my judgment about the only \"right\" bursts with\r\na crack, like a pneumatic tire. I see clearly that only an atavism,\r\nthe absurd superstition of the ancients, gives me this idea of\r\n\"right.\"\r\n\r\nThere are ideas of clay and ideas moulded of gold, or of our\r\nprecious glass. In order to know the material of which an idea is\r\nmade, one needs only to let fall upon it a drop of strong acid.\r\nOne of these acids was known to the ancients under the name of\r\n_reductio ad absurdum_. This was the name of it, I think. But they\r\nwere afraid of this poison; they preferred to believe that they saw\r\n_heaven_, even though it was a toy made of clay, rather than confess\r\nto themselves that it was only a blue nothing. We on the other hand\r\n(Glory to the Well-Doer!), we are adults and we have no need of\r\ntoys. Now if we put a drop of acid on the idea of \"right\".... Even\r\nthe ancients (the most mature of them) knew that the source of right\r\nwas--might! Right is a function of might. Here we have our scale: on\r\nthe one side an ounce, on the other a ton. On one side \"I,\" on the\r\nother \"we,\" the United State. Is it not clear? To assume that I may\r\nhave any \"right\" as far as the State is concerned, is like assuming\r\nthat an ounce may equilibrate a ton in a scale! Hence the natural\r\ndistribution: tons--rights, grams--duties. And the natural road from\r\nnothingness to greatness, is to forget that one is a gram and to\r\nfeel that one is one-millionth of a ton!\r\n\r\nYou ripe-bodied, bright Venerians; you sooty, blacksmith-like\r\nUranians, I almost hear your protests in this silence. But only\r\nthink, everything that is great is simple. Remember, only the four\r\nrules of arithmetic are unshakeable and eternal! And only that\r\nmortality will be unshakeable and eternal which is built upon those\r\nfour rules. This is the superior wisdom, this is the summit of that\r\npyramid around which people red with sweat, fought and battled for\r\ncenturies trying to crawl up!\r\n\r\nLooking from this summit down to the bottom, where something is\r\nstill left swarming like worms, from this summit all that is left\r\nover in us from the ancients seems alike. Alike are the unlawful\r\ncoming motherhood of O-90, a murder, and the insanity of that\r\nNumber who dared to throw verses into the face of the United State;\r\nand alike is the judgment for them--premature death. This is that\r\ndivine justice of which those stone-housed ancients dreamed, lit by\r\nthe naive pink rays of the dawn of history. Their \"God\" punished\r\nsacrilege as a capital crime.\r\n\r\nYou Uranians, morose and as black as the ancient Spaniards, who\r\nwere wise in knowing so well how to burn at the stake, you are\r\nsilent; I think you agree with me. But I hear you, pink Venerians,\r\nsaying something about \"tortures, executions, return to barbarism.\"\r\nMy dear Venerians, I pity you! You are incapable of philosophical,\r\nmathematical thinking. Human history moves upward in circles,\r\nlike an aero. The circles are at times golden, sometimes they are\r\nbloody, but all have 360 degrees. They go from 0° to 10°, 20°, 200°,\r\n360°,--and then again 0°. Yes, we have returned to zero. But for a\r\nmathematically working mind it is clear that this zero is different;\r\nit is a perfectly new zero. We started from zero to the right and\r\ncame to zero on the left. Hence instead of plus zero, we are at\r\nminus zero. Do you understand?\r\n\r\nThis zero appears to me now as a silent, immense, narrow rock,\r\nsharp as a blade. In cruel darkness, holding our breath, we set\r\nsail from the black night-side of the zero rock. For centuries we,\r\nColumbuses, floated and floated; we made the circuit of the whole\r\nworld and at last! Hurrah! Salute! We climbed up the masts; before\r\nus now was a new side of the zero rock, hitherto unknown, bathed\r\nin the Polar light of the United State; a blue mass covered with\r\nrainbow sparkles! Suns!--a hundred suns! A million rainbows! What\r\ndoes it matter if we are separated from the other, black side of\r\nthe zero rock only by the thickness of a blade? A knife is the most\r\nsolid, the most immortal, the most inspired invention of man. The\r\nknife served on the guillotine. The knife is the universal tool for\r\ncutting knots. The way of paradoxes follows its sharp edge, the only\r\nway becoming to a fearless mind....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-ONE\r\n\r\n  The Duty of an Author\r\n  The Ice-swells\r\n  The Most Difficult Love\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday was her day and again she did not come. Again there\r\ncame her incoherent note, explaining nothing. But I am tranquil,\r\nperfectly tranquil. If I do act as I am told to in the note, if I\r\ndo go to the controller on duty, produce the pink check and then,\r\nhaving lowered the curtains if I do sit alone in my room, I do all\r\nthis of course not because I have no power to act contrary to her\r\ndesire. It seems funny? Decidedly not! It is quite simple: separated\r\nfrom all curative, plaster-like smiles I am enabled quietly to\r\nwrite these very lines. This first. And second: I am afraid to lose\r\nin her, in I-330, perhaps the only clue I shall ever have to the\r\nunderstanding of all the unknowns, like the story of the cupboard,\r\nor my temporary death, for instance. To understand, to discover\r\nthese unknowns as the author of these records, I feel it simply my\r\nduty. Moreover, the unknown is naturally the enemy of man. And _Homo\r\nSapiens_ only then becomes Man in the complete sense of the word,\r\nwhen his punctuation includes no question marks, only exclamation\r\npoints, commas and periods.\r\n\r\nThus, guided by what seems to me simply my duty as an author, I\r\ntook an aero today at sixteen o'clock and went to the Ancient\r\nHouse. A strong wind was blowing against me. The aero advanced with\r\ndifficulty through the thicket of air, its transparent branches\r\nwhistling and whipping. The city below seemed a heap of blue blocks\r\nof ice. Suddenly--a cloud, a swift, oblique shadow. The ice became\r\nleaden; it swelled. As in springtime when you happen to stand at the\r\nshore and wait; in one more minute everything will move and pull\r\nand crack! But the minute passes and the ice remains motionless;\r\nyou feel as though you yourself are swelling, your heart beats\r\nmore restlessly, more frequently.... But why do I write about all\r\nthis? And whence all these strange sensations? For is there such an\r\niceberg as could ever break the most lucid, solid crystal of our\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the Ancient House I found no one. I went around\r\nit and found the old janitress near the Green Wall. She held her\r\nhand above her eyes, looking upward. Beyond the Wall, sharp black\r\ntriangles of some birds; they would rush, cawing, in onslaught\r\non the invisible fence of electric waves, and as they felt the\r\nelectricity against their breasts, they would recoil and soar once\r\nmore beyond the Wall.\r\n\r\nI noticed oblique, swift shadows on the dark, wrinkled face, a quick\r\nglance at me.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody here, nobody, nobody! No! And no use coming here....\"\r\n\r\nIn what respect is it \"no use\" and what a strange idea, to consider\r\nme somebody's shadow. Perhaps all of you are only my shadows. Did I\r\nnot populate these pages which only recently were white quadrangular\r\ndeserts, with you? Without me would they whom I shall guide over the\r\nnarrow paths of my lines, could they ever see you?\r\n\r\nOf course I did not say all this to the old woman. From experience\r\nI know that the most torturing thing is to inoculate someone with a\r\ndoubt as to the fact that he or she is a three-dimensional reality\r\nand not some other reality. I remarked only, quite drily, that her\r\nbusiness was to open the gate, and she let me into the courtyard.\r\n\r\nIt was empty. Quiet. The wind remained beyond the walls, distant\r\nas on that day, when shoulder to shoulder, two like one, we came\r\nout from beneath, from the corridors,--if it ever really happened.\r\nI walked under stone arches, my steps resounded against the\r\ndamp vaults and fell behind me, sounding as though someone were\r\ncontinually following me. The yellow walls with patches of red brick\r\nwere watching me through their square spectacles, windows,--watching\r\nme open the squeaky doors of a barn, look into corners, nooks\r\nand hidden places.... A gate in the fence and a lonely spot. The\r\nmonument of the Two Hundred Years' War. From the ground naked, stone\r\nribs were sticking out. The yellow jaws of the wall. An ancient oven\r\nwith a chimney like a ship petrified forever among red-brick waves.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that I had seen those yellow teeth once before.\r\nI saw them still dimly in my mind, as at the bottom of a\r\nbarrel, through water. And I began to search. I fell into caves\r\noccasionally; I stumbled over stones; rusty jaws caught my unif a\r\nfew times; salt drops of sweat ran from my forehead into my eyes.\r\n\r\nNowhere! I could find that exit from below, from the corridors,\r\nnowhere! There was none. Well, perhaps it was better that it\r\nhappened so. Probably that _all_ was only one of my absurd \"dreams.\"\r\n\r\nTired out, covered with cobweb and dust, I opened the gate to return\r\nto the main yard, when suddenly ... a rustle behind me, splashing\r\nsteps, and there before me were the pink wing-like ears and the\r\ndouble-curved smile of S-. Half closing his eyes, he bored his\r\nlittle drills into me and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Taking a walk?\"\r\n\r\nI was silent. My arms were heavy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, do you feel better now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank you. I think I am getting normal again.\"\r\n\r\nHe let me go. He lifted his eyes, looked upward, and I noticed his\r\nAdam's apple for the first time; it resembles a broken spring,\r\nsticking out from beneath the upholstery of a divan.\r\n\r\nAbove us, not very high (about 50 meters) aeros were buzzing. By\r\ntheir low, slow flight and by the observation tubes which hung down,\r\nI recognized them. They were the aeros of the Guardians. But there\r\nwere not two or three, as usual, there were about ten or twelve (I\r\nregret to have to confine myself to an approximate figure).\r\n\r\n\"Why are there so many today?\" I dared to ask S-.\r\n\r\n\"Why? Hm.... A real physician begins to treat a patient when\r\nhe is still well but on the way to becoming sick tomorrow,\r\nday-after-tomorrow or within a week. Prophylaxis! Yes!\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded and went splashing over the stones of the yard. Then he\r\nturned his head and said over his shoulder, \"Be careful!\"\r\n\r\nAgain I was alone. Silence. Emptiness. Far beyond the Green Wall the\r\nbirds and the wind. What did he mean? My aero ran very fast with the\r\nwind. Light and heavy shadows from the clouds. Below blue cupolas,\r\ncubes of glass-ice were becoming leaden and swelling....\r\n\r\n_The Same Evening_\r\n\r\nI took up my pen just now in order to write upon these pages a\r\nfew thoughts which, it seems to me, will prove useful for you,\r\nmy readers. These thoughts are concerned with the great Day of\r\nUnanimity which is now not far away. But as I sat down, I discovered\r\nthat I cannot write at present; instead I sit and listen to the wind\r\nbeating the glass with its dark wings; all the while I am busy\r\nlooking about and I am waiting, expecting.... What? I do not know.\r\nSo I was very glad when I saw the brownish-pink gills enter my room,\r\nheartily glad I may say. She sat down and innocently smoothed a fold\r\nof her unif that fell between her knees, and very soon she pasted\r\nupon me, all over me, a host of smiles,--a bit of a smile on each\r\ncrack of my face and this gave me pleasant sensations, as if I were\r\ntightly bound like an infant of the ancients in a swaddling-cloth.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine! Today, when I entered the classroom\" (she works in the\r\nChild-Educational Refinery), \"I suddenly noticed a caricature upon\r\nthe blackboard. Indeed! I assure you! They had pictured me in the\r\nform of a fish! Perhaps I really--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Why do you say that?\" I hastily exclaimed. When one was\r\nnear her, it was clear indeed that she had nothing resembling\r\ngills. No. When I referred to gills in these pages I was certainly\r\nirreverent.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, after all it does not matter. But the act as such, think of\r\nit! Of course I called the Guardians at once. I love children very\r\nmuch and I think that the most difficult and the most exalted love\r\nis--cruelty. You understand me, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly!\" Her sentence so closely resembled my thoughts! I could\r\nnot refrain from reading to her a passage from my Record No. 20,\r\nbeginning \"Quietly, metallically, distinctly, do the thoughts\" ...\r\netc. I felt her brownish-pink cheeks twitching and coming closer\r\nand closer to me. Suddenly I felt in my hands her firm, dry, even\r\nslightly prickling fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Give, give this to me please. I shall have it phonographed and make\r\nthe children learn it by heart. Not only your Venerians need all\r\nthis, but we ourselves right now, tomorrow, day-after-tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced around and said in a very low voice:\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard, they say that on the Day of Unanimity--\"\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet.\r\n\r\n\"What? What do they say? What--on the Day of Unanimity?\"\r\n\r\nThe coziness of my room, its very walls, seemed to have vanished. I\r\nfelt myself thrown outside, where the tremendous, shaggy wind was\r\ntossing about and where the slanting clouds of dusk were descending\r\nlower and lower....\r\n\r\nU- boldly and firmly grasped me by the shoulders. I even noticed how\r\nher fingers, responding to my emotion, trembled slightly.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, dear, and don't be upset. They say many things; must we\r\nbelieve them all? Moreover, if only you need me, I shall be near you\r\non that day. I shall leave the school-children with someone else and\r\nI shall stay with you, for you, dear, you too are a child and you\r\nneed....\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" (I raised my hands in protest). \"Not for anything! You\r\nreally think then that I am a child and that I cannot do without\r\na.... Oh, no! Not for anything in the world.\" (I must confess I had\r\nother plans for that day!)\r\n\r\nShe smiled. The wording of that smile apparently was: \"Oh, what a\r\nstubborn, what a stubborn boy!\" She sat down, eyelids lowered. Her\r\nhands modestly busied themselves with fixing the fold of the unif\r\nwhich fell again between her knees, and suddenly, about something\r\nentirely different, she said:\r\n\r\n\"I think I must decide ... for your sake.... But I implore you, do\r\nnot hurry me. I must think it over.\"\r\n\r\nI did not hurry her, although I realized that I ought to have been\r\ndelighted, as there is no greater honor than to crown someone's\r\nevening years.\r\n\r\n... All night strange wings were about. I walked and protected my\r\nhead with my hands from those wings. And a chair, not like ours, but\r\nan ancient chair, came in with a horse-like gait: first the right\r\nfore- and left hind-leg, then the left fore- and right hind-leg. It\r\nrushed to my bed and crawled into it, and I liked that wooden chair,\r\nalthough it made me uncomfortable and caused me some pain.\r\n\r\nIt is very strange; is it really impossible to find any cure for\r\nthis dream-sickness, or to make it rational, perhaps even useful?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-TWO\r\n\r\n  The Benumbed Waves\r\n  Everything Is Improving\r\n  I Am a Microbe\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease imagine that you stand at the seashore. The waves go\r\nrhythmically up, down, up.... Suddenly when they have risen they\r\nremain in that position, benumbed, torpid! It was just as weird\r\nand unnatural when everything became confused and our regular walk\r\nwhich is prescribed by the Tables, suddenly came to an end. The\r\nlast time such a thing happened was 119 years ago, when according\r\nto our historians a meteorite fell hissing and fuming into the\r\nvery midst of the marchers. We were walking yesterday as usual,\r\nthat is like warriors on the Assyrian monuments, a thousand heads\r\nand two composite, integrated legs and two swinging integrated\r\narms. At the end of the avenue where the Accumulating Tower was\r\nformidably resounding, a quadrangle appeared: on the sides, in\r\nfront and behind--guards; in the centre three Numbers. Their unifs\r\nwere already stripped of the golden State badges; everything was\r\npainfully clear. The enormous dial on the top of the Tower looked\r\nlike a face; it bent down from the clouds and spitting down its\r\nseconds, it waited with indifference. It showed six minutes past\r\nthirteen exactly. There was some confusion in the quadrangle. I was\r\nvery close and I saw the most minute details. I clearly remember\r\na thin, long neck and on the temple a confused net of small blue\r\nveins like rivers on the map of a small unfamiliar world, and that\r\nunknown world was apparently still a very young man. He evidently\r\nnoticed someone in our ranks; he stopped, rose upon his tip-toes\r\nand stretched his neck. One of the guards snapped his back with\r\nthe bluish spark of the electric whip--he squealed in a thin voice\r\nlike a puppy. The distinct snaps followed each other at intervals\r\nof approximately two seconds; a snap and a squeal, a snap and a\r\nsqueal.... We continued to walk as usual, rhythmically, in our\r\nAssyrian manner. I watched the graceful zigzags of the electric\r\nsparks and thought: \"Human society is constantly improving, as it\r\nshould. How ugly a tool was the ancient whip and how much beauty\r\nthere is--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, like a nut flying from a wheel revolving at full\r\nspeed, a female Number, thin, flexible and tense, tore herself\r\nfrom our rows, and with a cry, \"Enough! Don't you dare!\" she threw\r\nherself straight into the quadrangle. It was like the meteorite of\r\n119 years ago; our march came to a standstill and our rows appeared\r\nlike the gray crests of waves frozen by sudden cold. For a second\r\nI looked at that woman's figure with the eye of a stranger as all\r\nthe others did. She was no Number any longer; she was only a human\r\nbeing and she existed for us only as a substantiation of the insult\r\nwhich she cast upon the United State. But a motion of hers, her\r\nbending while twisting to the left upon her hips, revealed to me\r\nclearly who she was. I knew, I knew that body, flexible as a whip!\r\nMy eyes, my lips, my hands knew it; at that moment I was absolutely\r\ncertain.... Two of the guards dashed to catch her. One more moment\r\nand that limpid mirror-like point on the pavement would have become\r\nthe point of meeting of their trajectories, and she would have been\r\ncaught! My heart fell, stopped. Without thinking whether it was\r\npermissible or not, whether it was reasonable or absurd, I threw\r\nmyself straight to that point.\r\n\r\nI felt thousands of eyes bulging with horror fixed upon me but that\r\nonly added a sort of desperately joyful power to that wild being\r\nwith hairy paws which arose in me and ran faster and faster. Two\r\nmore steps--she turned around--\r\n\r\nI saw a quivering face covered with freckles, red eyebrows.... It\r\nwas not she! Not I-330!\r\n\r\nA rabid, quivering joy took hold of me. I wanted to shout something\r\nlike: \"Catch her! Get her, that--\" But I heard only my whisper. A\r\nheavy hand was already upon my shoulder; I was caught and led away.\r\nI tried to explain to them:\r\n\r\n\"But listen, you must understand that I thought that....\"\r\n\r\nBut could I explain even to myself all the sickness which I have\r\ndescribed in these pages? My light went out; I waited obediently. As\r\na leaf that is torn from its branch by a sudden gust of wind falls\r\nhumbly, but on its way down turns and tries to catch every little\r\nbranch, every fork, every knot; so I tried to catch every one of the\r\nsilent, globe-like heads, or the transparent ice of the walls, or\r\nthe blue needle of the Accumulating Tower which seemed to pierce the\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, when a heavy curtain was about to separate from me\r\nthis beautiful world, I noticed not far away a familiar, enormous\r\nhead gliding over the mirror surface of the pavement and wagging its\r\nwing-like ears. I heard a familiar, flat voice:\r\n\r\n\"I deem it my duty to testify that Number D-503 is ill and is unable\r\nto regulate his emotions. Moreover, I am sure that he was led by\r\nnatural indignation--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Yes!\" I exclaimed, \"I even shouted 'catch her!'\"\r\n\r\nFrom behind me: \"You did not shout anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I wanted to. I swear by the Well-Doer, I wanted to!\"\r\n\r\nFor a second I was bored through by the gray, cold, drill-eyes.\r\nI don't know whether he believed that what I said was the truth\r\n(almost!), or whether he had some secret reason for sparing me for a\r\nwhile, but he wrote a short note, handed it to one of those who had\r\nheld me and again I was free. That is, I was again included in the\r\norderly, endless, Assyrian rows of Numbers.\r\n\r\nThe quadrangle, the freckled face and the temple with the map of\r\nblue veinlets disappeared forever around the corner. We walked\r\nagain--a million-headed body; and in each one of us resided that\r\nhumble joyfulness with which in all probability molecules, atoms and\r\nphagocytes live.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient days the Christians understood this feeling; they are\r\nour only (though very imperfect) direct forerunners. The greatness\r\nof the \"Church of the United Flock\" was known to them. They knew\r\nthat resignation is virtue, and pride--a vice; that \"We\" is from\r\nGod, \"I\" from the devil.\r\n\r\nI was walking, keeping step with the others yet separated from them.\r\nI was still trembling from the emotion just felt, like a bridge\r\nover which a thundering ancient steel train has passed a moment\r\nbefore. I _felt_ myself. To feel one's self, to be conscious of\r\none's personality, is the lot of an eye inflamed by a cinder, or an\r\ninfected finger, or a bad tooth. A healthy eye, or finger, or tooth\r\nis not felt; it is non-existent as it were. Is it not clear then,\r\nthat consciousness of oneself is a sickness?\r\n\r\nApparently I am no longer a phagocyte which quietly, in a\r\nbusiness-like way devours microbes (microbes with freckled faces\r\nand blue temples); apparently I am myself a microbe, and she too,\r\nI-330, is a microbe, a wonderful, diabolic microbe! It is quite\r\npossible that there are already thousands of such microbes among us,\r\nstill pretending to be phagocytes, as I pretend. What if today's\r\naccident, although in itself not important, is only a beginning,\r\nonly the first meteorite of a shower of burning and thundering\r\nstones which the infinite may have poured out upon our glass\r\nparadise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-THREE\r\n\r\n  Flowers\r\n  The Dissolution of a Crystal\r\n  If only (?)\r\n\r\n\r\nThey say there are flowers that bloom only once in a hundred years.\r\nWhy not suppose the existence of flowers that bloom only once a\r\nthousand years? We may have known nothing about them until now only\r\nbecause today is the \"once in a thousand years\"?\r\n\r\nHappy and dizzy I walked downstairs to the controller on duty\r\nand quickly under my gaze all around me and silently the\r\nthousand-year-old buds burst, and everything was blooming:\r\narmchairs, shoes, golden badges, electric bulbs, someone's dark\r\nheavy eyes, the polished columns of the banisters, the handkerchief\r\nwhich someone lost on the stairs, the small, ink-blotted desk of the\r\ncontroller and the tender brown, somewhat freckled cheeks of U-.\r\nEverything seemed not ordinary, new, tender, rosy, moist. U- took\r\nthe pink stub from me while the blue, aromatic moon, hanging from an\r\nunseen branch, shone through the glass of the wall and over the head\r\nof U-. With a solemn gesture I pointed my finger and said:\r\n\r\n\"The moon. You see?\"\r\n\r\nU- glanced at me, then at the number of the stub and again made that\r\nfamiliar, charmingly innocent movement with which she fixes the fold\r\nof the unif between her knees.\r\n\r\n\"You look abnormal and ill, dear. Abnormality and illness are the\r\nsame thing. You are killing yourself. And no one would tell you\r\nthat, no one!\"\r\n\r\nThat \"No one\" was certainly equivalent to the number on the\r\nstub,--I-330. This thought was confirmed by an ink-blot which\r\nfell close to the figure 330. Dear, wonderful U-! You are right,\r\nof course. I am not reasonable. I am sick. I have a soul. I am a\r\nmicrobe. But is blooming--not a sickness? Is it not painful when the\r\nbuds are bursting? And don't you think that spermatozoa are the most\r\nterrible of all microbes?\r\n\r\nBack upstairs to my room. In the widely open cup of the armchair\r\nwas I-330. I, on the floor, embracing her limbs, my head on her\r\nlap. We were silent. Everything was silent. Only the pulse was\r\naudible. Like a crystal I was _dissolving_ in her, in I-330. I\r\nfelt most distinctly how the polished facets which limited me in\r\nspace were slowly thawing, melting away. I was dissolving in her\r\nlap, in her, and I became at once smaller and larger and larger,\r\nunembraceable. For she was not she but the whole universe. For a\r\nsecond I and that armchair near the bed, transfixed with joy, we\r\nwere one. And the wonderfully smiling old woman at the gate of the\r\nAncient House, and the wild debris beyond the Green Wall, and some\r\nstrange silver wreckage on a black background, dozing like the old\r\nwoman and the slam of a door in the distance,--all this was within\r\nme, was listening to my pulse and soaring through the happiest of\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nIn absurd, confused, overflowing words I attempted to tell her that\r\nI was a crystal and that there was a door in me, and that I felt how\r\nhappy the armchair was. But something nonsensical came out of the\r\nattempt and I stopped. I was ashamed. And suddenly:\r\n\r\n\"Dear I-! Forgive me! I understand nothing. I talk so foolishly!\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should you think that foolishness is not fine? If we had\r\ntaken pains to educate human foolishness through centuries, as\r\nwe have done with our intelligence, it might perhaps have been\r\ntransformed into something very precious.\"\r\n\r\nYes, I think she is right! How could she be wrong at that moment?\r\n\r\n\"... And for this foolishness of yours and for what you did\r\nyesterday during the walk, I love you the more, much more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you torture me? Why would you not come? Why did you\r\nsend me the pink check and make me--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I wanted to test you. Perhaps I must be sure that you will\r\ndo anything I wish, that you are completely mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, completely.\"\r\n\r\nShe took my face, my whole self, between her palms, lifted my head:\r\n\r\n\"And how about 'It is the duty of every honest Number'? Eh?\"\r\n\r\nSweet, sharp, white teeth,--a smile. In the open cup of the armchair\r\nshe was like a bee,--sting and honey combined.\r\n\r\nYes, duty.... I turned over in my mind the pages of my records;\r\nindeed there is not a thought about the fact that strictly speaking\r\nI should....\r\n\r\nI was silent. Exaltedly (and probably stupidly) I smiled, looking\r\ninto the pupils of her eyes. I followed first one eye and then\r\nthe other and in each of them I saw myself, a millimetric self\r\nimprisoned in those tiny rainbow cells. Then again the lips and the\r\nsweet pain of blooming.\r\n\r\nIn each Number of the United State there is an unseen metronome\r\nwhich tick-tocks silently; without looking at the clock we know\r\nexactly the time of day within five minutes. But now my metronome\r\nhad stopped and I did not know how much time had passed. In fright\r\nI grasped my badge with its clock from under the pillow. Glory be\r\nto the Well-Doer! I had twenty minutes more! But those minutes were\r\nsuch tiny, short ones! They ran! And I wanted to tell her so many\r\nthings. I wanted to tell her all about myself; about the letter from\r\nO- and about that terrible evening when I gave her a child; and for\r\nsome reason also about my childhood, about our mathematician Plappa\r\nand about the square-root of minus one; and how, when I attended\r\nthe glorification on the Day of Unanimity for the first time in my\r\nlife, I wept bitterly because there was an ink-stain on my unif--on\r\nsuch a holy day!\r\n\r\nI-330 lifted her head. She leaned on her elbow. In the corners\r\nof her lips two long, sharp lines and the dark angle of lifted\r\neyebrows--a cross.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps on that day ...\" her brow grew darker; she took my hand and\r\npressed it hard. \"Tell me, will you ever forget me? Will you always\r\nremember me?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why such talk? What is it, I-, dear?\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent. And her eyes were already sliding past me, through\r\nme, away into the distance. I suddenly heard the wind beating the\r\nglass with its enormous wings. Of course it had been blowing all the\r\nwhile but I had not noticed it until then. And for some reason those\r\ncawing birds over the Green Wall came to my mind.\r\n\r\nI-330 shook her head with a gesture of throwing something off. Once\r\nmore she touched me for a second with her whole body, as an aero\r\nbefore landing touches the ground for a second with all the tension\r\nof a recoiling spring.\r\n\r\n\"Well, give me my stockings, quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe stockings were on the desk, on the open manuscript, on page 124.\r\nBeing in haste I caught some of the pages and they were scattered\r\nover the floor so that it was hard to put them back in the proper\r\norder. Moreover, even if I put them in that order there will be no\r\nreal order; there are obstacles to that anyway, some undiscoverable\r\nunknowns.\r\n\r\n\"I can't bear it,\" I said, \"You are here, near me, yet you seem to\r\nbe behind an opaque ancient wall; through that wall I hear a rustle\r\nand voices; I cannot make out the words, I don't know what is there.\r\nI cannot bear it. You seem always to withhold something from me; you\r\nhave never told me what kind of a place it was where I found myself\r\nthat day beneath the Ancient House. Where did those corridors lead?\r\nWhy was the doctor there,--or perhaps all that never happened?\"\r\n\r\nI-330 put her hands on my shoulders and slowly entered deeply into\r\nmy eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You want to know all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you would not be afraid to follow me anywhere? Wherever I\r\nshould lead you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anywhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right then. I promise you, after the holiday, if only.... Oh\r\nyes, there is your _Integral_. I always forget to ask; will it soon\r\nbe completed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. 'If only' what? Again! 'If only' what?\"\r\n\r\nShe, already at the door: \"You shall see.\"\r\n\r\nI was again alone. All that she left behind her was a barely\r\nperceptible scent, similar to that of a sweet, dry, yellow dust of\r\nflowers from behind the Green Wall; also, sunk deeply within me,\r\nquestion marks like small hooks similar to those the ancients used\r\nfor fishing (_vide_ the Prehistoric Museum).\r\n\r\n... Why did she suddenly ask about the _Integral_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-FOUR\r\n\r\n  The Limit of the Function\r\n  Easter\r\n  To Cross Out Everything\r\n\r\n\r\nI am like a motor set in motion at a speed of too many revolutions\r\nper second, the bearings have become too hot and in one more minute\r\nthe molten metal will begin to drip and everything will go to the\r\ndevil. Cold water! Quick! Some logic! I pour pailfuls of it, but my\r\nlogic merely sizzles on the hot metal and disappears in the air in\r\nthe form of vapor.\r\n\r\nOf course it is clear that in order to establish the true meaning\r\nof a function, one must establish its limit. It is also clear that\r\nyesterday's \"dissolution in the universe\" taken to its limit is\r\ndeath. For death is exactly the most complete dissolution of the\r\nself in the universe. Hence: L=f(D), love is the function of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nYes, exactly, exactly! That is why I am afraid of I-330; I struggle\r\nagainst her, I don't want.... But why is it that within me \"I don't\r\nwant to\" and \"I want to\" stand side by side? That is the chief\r\nhorror of the matter; I continue to long for that happy death of\r\nyesterday. The horror of it is that even now, when I have integrated\r\nthe logical function, when it becomes evident that the latter\r\ncontains death hidden in it, nevertheless I long for it with my\r\nlips, arms, breast, with every millimeter....\r\n\r\nTomorrow is the Day of Unanimity. She will certainly be there and I\r\nshall see her, though from a distance. That distance will be painful\r\nto me, for I must be, I am inevitably drawn, close to her, so that\r\nher hands, her shoulder, her hair.... I long for even that pain....\r\nLet it come.... Great Well-Doer! How absurd to desire pain! Who is\r\nignorant of the simple fact that pains are negative items which\r\nreduce that sum total we call happiness? Consequently ... Well, no\r\n\"consequently\" ... Emptiness.... Nakedness!\r\n\r\n_The Same Evening._\r\n\r\nThrough the glass wall of the house I see a disquieting, windy,\r\nfeverishly pink, sunset. I move my armchair to avoid that pinkness\r\nand turn over these pages, and I find I am forgetting that I write\r\nthis not for myself but for you unknown people whom I love and pity,\r\nfor you who still lag centuries behind, below. Let me tell you about\r\nthe Day of Unanimity, about that Great Day. I think that day for us\r\nis what Easter was for the ancients. I remember I used to prepare an\r\nhour-calendar the eve of that day; solemnly I would cross out every\r\ntime the figure of the hour elapsed; nearer by one hour! one hour\r\nless to wait!... If I were certain that nobody would discover it, I\r\nassure you I should now too, make out such a calendar and carry it\r\nwith me, and I should watch how many hours remain until tomorrow,\r\nwhen I shall see, at least from a distance....\r\n\r\n(I was interrupted. They brought me a new unif from the shop. As is\r\ncustomary, new unifs are given to us for tomorrow's celebration.\r\nSteps in the hall, exclamations of joy, noises.)\r\n\r\nI shall continue; tomorrow I shall see the same spectacle which we\r\nsee year after year and which always awakes in us fresh emotions,\r\nas though we saw it for the first time: an impressive throng of\r\npiously lifted arms. Tomorrow is the day of the yearly election of\r\nthe Well-Doer. Tomorrow we shall again hand over to our Well-Doer\r\nthe keys to the impregnable fortress of our happiness. Certainly\r\nthis in no way resembles the disorderly, unorganized election-days\r\nof the ancients, on which (it seems so funny!) they did not even\r\nknow in advance the result of the election. To build a state on some\r\nnon-discountable contingencies, to build blindly,--what could be\r\nmore nonsensical? Yet centuries were required to pass before this\r\nwas understood!\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, we in this respect as in all others have no place\r\nfor contingencies; nothing unexpected can happen. The elections\r\nthemselves have rather a symbolic meaning. They remind us that we\r\nare a united, powerful organism of millions of cells, that--, to\r\nuse the language of the \"gospel\" of the ancients, we are a united\r\nchurch. The history of the United State knows not a single case\r\nin which upon this solemn day even a solitary voice has dared to\r\nviolate the magnificent unison.\r\n\r\nThey say that the ancients used to conduct their elections secretly,\r\nstealthily like thieves. Some of our historians assert even that\r\nthey would come to the electoral celebrations completely masked.\r\nImagine the weird, fantastic spectacle! Night. A plaza. Along the\r\nwalls the stealthily creeping figures covered with mantles. The\r\nred flame of torches dancing in the wind.... Why was such secrecy\r\nnecessary? It has never been satisfactorily explained. Probably it\r\nresulted from the fact that elections were associated with some\r\nmystic and superstitious, perhaps even criminal ceremonies. We have\r\nnothing to conceal or to be ashamed of; we celebrate our election\r\nopenly, honestly, in daylight. I see them all vote for the Well-Doer\r\nand everybody sees me vote for the Well-Doer. How could it be\r\notherwise, since \"all\" and \"I\" are one \"we\"? How ennobling, sincere,\r\nlofty, is this compared with the cowardly, thievish \"secrecy\" of the\r\nancients! Moreover, how much more expedient! For even admitting for\r\na moment the impossible, that is the outbreak of some dissonance in\r\nour customary unity, in that case our unseen Guardians are always\r\nright there among us, are they not, to register the Numbers who\r\nwould fall into error and save them from any further false steps?\r\nThe United State is theirs, the Numbers'! And besides....\r\n\r\nThrough the wall to my left a she-number before the mirror-door\r\nof the closet; she is hastily unbuttoning her unif. For a second,\r\nswiftly--eyes, lips, two sharp, pink ... the curtains fell. Within\r\nme instantly awoke all that happened yesterday and now I no longer\r\nknow what I meant to say by \"besides....\" I no longer wish to;--I\r\ncannot. I want one thing. I want I-330. I want her every minute,\r\nevery second, to be with me, with no one else. All that I wrote\r\nabout Unanimity is of no value; it is not what I want; I have a\r\ndesire to cross it out, to tear it to pieces and throw it away. For\r\nI know (be it a sacrilege, yet it is the truth), that a glorious Day\r\nis possible only with her and only then when we are side by side,\r\nshoulder to shoulder. Without her the Sun of tomorrow will appear\r\nto me only as a little circle cut out of a tin sheet, and the sky a\r\nsheet of tin painted blue, and I myself ... I snatched the telephone\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\n\"I-330, are you there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is I. Why so late?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not too late yet. I want to ask you ... I want you to be\r\nwith me tomorrow--dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear\" I said in a very low voice. And for some reason a thing I\r\nsaw this morning at the docks flashed through my mind: just for\r\nfun someone put a watch under the hundred-ton sledge-hammer....\r\nA swing, a breath of wind in the face and the silent hundred-ton,\r\nknife-like weight on the breakable watch....\r\n\r\nA silence. I thought I heard someone's whisper in I-330's room. Then\r\nher voice:\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot. Of course you understand that I myself.... No, I\r\ncannot. 'Why?' You shall see tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nNight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-FIVE\r\n\r\n  The Descent from Heaven\r\n  The Greatest Catastrophe in History\r\n  The Known--Is Ended\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning all arose, and the hymn, like a solemn mantle,\r\nslowly waved above our heads. Hundreds of tubes of the Musical Tower\r\nand millions of human voices. For a second I forgot everything; I\r\nforgot that alarming something at which I-330 hinted in connection\r\nwith today's celebration; I think I even forgot about her. At that\r\nmoment I was the very same little boy who once wept because of a\r\ntiny ink-stain on his unif, which no one else could see. Even if it\r\nbe so, if nobody sees that I am covered with black, ineffaceable\r\nstains, I know it, do I not? I know that there should be no place\r\nfor a criminal like me among these frank open faces. What if I\r\nshould rush forward and shout out all at once everything about\r\nmyself! The end might follow. Let it! At least for a second I would\r\nfeel myself clear and clean and senseless like that innocent blue\r\nsky....\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed upward; in the pure morning blue, still moist\r\nwith the tears of night, a small dark spot appeared. Now it was\r\ndark, now bathed in the rays of the sun. It was He, descending to\r\nus from the sky, He--the new Jehovah--in an aero, He, as wise and as\r\nlovingly cruel as the Jehovah of the ancients. Nearer and nearer,\r\nand higher toward him were drawn millions of hearts. Already he\r\nsaw us. And in my mind with Him I looked over everything from the\r\nheights: concentric circles of stands marked with dotted blue lines\r\nof unifs,--like circles of a spider-web strewn with microscopic suns\r\n(the shining of the badges). And in the centre there soon the wise\r\nwhite spider would occupy his place--the Well-Doer clad in white,\r\nthe Well-Doer who wisely tangled our hands and feet in the salutary\r\nnet of happiness.\r\n\r\nHis magnificent descent from the sky was accomplished. The brassy\r\nHymn came to silence; all sat down. At once I perceived that\r\neverything was really a very thin spider-web, the threads of which\r\nwere stretched tense and trembling, and it seemed that in a moment\r\nthose threads might break and something improbable....\r\n\r\nI half rose and looked around, and I met many lovingly-worried eyes\r\nwhich passed from one face to another. I saw someone lifting his\r\nhand and almost imperceptibly waving his fingers--he was making\r\nsigns to another. The latter replied with a similar finger-sign. And\r\na third.... I understood; they were the Guardians. I understood;\r\nthey were alarmed by something--the spider-web was stretched and\r\ntrembling. And within me as if tuned to the same wave-length of a\r\nradio, within me there was a corresponding quiver.\r\n\r\nOn the platform a poet was reciting his pre-electoral ode. I could\r\nnot hear a single word; I only felt the rhythmic swing of the\r\nhexametric pendulum, and with its every motion I felt how nearer and\r\nnearer there was approaching some hour set for.... I continued to\r\nturn over face after face like pages but I could not find the one,\r\nthe only one, I was seeking, the one I needed to find at once, as\r\nsoon as possible, for one more swing of the pendulum and....\r\n\r\nIt was he, certainly it was he! Below, past the main platform,\r\ngliding over the sparkling glass, the ear-wings flapped by, the\r\nrunning body gave a reflection of a double-curved S-, like a noose\r\nwhich was rolling toward some of the intricate passages among the\r\nstands. S-, I-330,--there is some thread between them. I have always\r\nfelt some thread between them. I don't know yet what that thread is\r\nbut some day I shall untangle it. I planted my gaze on him; he was\r\nrushing farther away, behind him that invisible thread.... There he\r\nstopped ... there.... I was pierced, twisted together into a knot as\r\nif by a lightning-like, many-volted electric discharge; in my row,\r\nnot more than 40° from me, S- stopped and bowed. I saw I-330 and\r\nbeside her the smiling, repellent, negro-lipped R-13.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was to rush to her and cry, \"Why with him? Why did\r\nyou not want...?\" But the salutary invisible spider-web bound fast\r\nmy hands and feet; so, gritting my teeth together I sat stiff as\r\niron, my gaze fixed upon them. A sharp _physical_ pain at my heart.\r\nI remember my thought: \"if non-physical causes effect physical pain,\r\nthen it is clear that....\"\r\n\r\nI regret that I did not come to any conclusion. I remember only that\r\nsomething about \"soul\" flashed through my mind, a purely nonsensical\r\nancient expression, \"His soul fell into his boots\" passed through my\r\nhead. My heart sank. The hexameter came to an end. It was about to\r\nstart. What \"It\"?\r\n\r\nThe five minute pre-election recess established by custom. The\r\ncustom-established pre-electional silence. But now it was not that\r\npious, really prayer-like silence that it usually was. Now it was\r\nas in the ancient days when there were no Accumulating Towers,\r\nwhen the sky, still untamed in those days, would roar from time to\r\ntime with its \"storms.\" It was like the \"lull before the storm\"\r\nof the ancient days. The air seemed to be made of transparent,\r\nvaporized cast-iron. One wanted to breathe with one's mouth wide\r\nopen. My hearing, intense to painfulness, registered from behind a\r\nmouse-like, gnawing, worried whisper. Without lifting my eyes I saw\r\nthose two, I-330 and R-13, side by side, shoulder to shoulder,--and\r\non my knees my trembling, foreign, hateful, hairy hands....\r\n\r\nEverybody was holding a badge with a clock in his hands. One....\r\nTwo.... Three.... Five minutes. From the main platform a cast-iron,\r\nslow voice:\r\n\r\n\"Those in favor shall lift their hands.\"\r\n\r\nIf only I dared to look straight into his eyes as formerly! Straight\r\nand devotedly, and think: \"Here I am, my whole self! Take me!\" But\r\nnow I did not dare. I had to make an effort to raise my hand, as if\r\nmy joints were rusty.\r\n\r\nA whisper of millions of hands. Someone's subdued \"Ah!\" and I felt\r\nsomething was coming, falling heavily, but I could not understand\r\nwhat it was, and I did not have the strength or courage to take a\r\nlook....\r\n\r\n\"Those opposed?\"...\r\n\r\nThis was always the most magnificent moment of our celebration: all\r\nwould remain sitting motionless, joyfully bowing their heads under\r\nthe salutary yoke of that Number of Numbers. But now, to my horror\r\nagain I heard a rustle; light as a sigh, yet it was more distinct\r\neven than the brass tube of the Hymn. Thus the last sigh in a man's\r\nlife, around him people with their faces pale and with drops of cold\r\nsweat upon their foreheads.... I lifted my eyes and....\r\n\r\nIt took one hundredth of a second only; I saw thousands of hands\r\narise \"opposed\" and fall back. I saw the pale cross-marked face of\r\nI-330 and her lifted hand. Darkness came upon my eyes.\r\n\r\nAnother hundredth of a second, silence. Quiet. The pulse. Then, as\r\nif at the sign of some mad conductor, from all the stands rattling,\r\nshouting, a whirlwind of unifs lifted by the rush, the perplexed\r\nfigures of the Guardians running to and fro. Someone's heels in\r\nthe air near my eyes and close to those heels someone's wide-open\r\nmouth tearing itself by an inaudible scream. For some reason this\r\npicture remains particularly distinct in my memory: thousands of\r\nmouths noiselessly yelling as if on the screen of a monstrous\r\ncinema. Also as if on a screen, somewhere below at a distance, for a\r\nsecond--O-90, pressed against the wall in a passage, her lips white,\r\ndefending her abdomen with her crossed arms. She disappeared as if\r\nwashed away by a wave, or else I simply forgot her because....\r\n\r\nThis not on the screen any more but within me, within my compressed\r\nheart, within the rapidly pulsating temples; over my head, somewhat\r\nto the left, R-13 suddenly jumped upon a bench, all sprinkling, red,\r\nrabid. In his arms was I-330, pale, her unif torn from shoulder to\r\nbreast, red blood on white. She firmly held him round the neck, and\r\nhe with huge leaps from bench to bench, repellent and agile, like a\r\ngorilla, was carrying her away upward.\r\n\r\nAs if it were in a fire of ancient days, everything became red\r\naround me. Only one thing in my head: to jump after them, to catch\r\nthem. At this moment I cannot explain to myself the source of that\r\nstrength within me, but like a battering-ram I broke through the\r\ncrowd, over somebody's shoulders, over a bench and I was there in a\r\nmoment and caught R-13 by the collar:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you dare! Don't you dare, I say! Immediately--\"\r\n\r\nFortunately no one could hear my voice, as everyone was shouting and\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it? What is the matter? What--\" R-13 turned around; his\r\nsprinkling lips were trembling. He apparently thought it was one of\r\nthe Guardians.\r\n\r\n\"What? I do not want--I won't allow--Put her down at once!\"\r\n\r\nBut he only sprinkled angrily with his lips, shook his head and ran\r\non. Then I ... I am terribly ashamed to write all this down but I\r\nbelieve I must, so that you, my unknown readers, may make a complete\r\nstudy of my disease.... Then I hit him over the head with all my\r\nmight. You understand? I hit him. This I remember distinctly. I\r\nremember also a feeling of liberation that followed my action, a\r\nfeeling of lightness in my whole body.\r\n\r\nI-330 slid quickly out of his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Go away!\" she shouted to R-, \"Don't you see that he--? Go!\"\r\n\r\nR-13 showed his white negro teeth, sprinkled into my face some word,\r\ndived down and disappeared. And I picked up I-330, pressed her\r\nfirmly to myself and carried her away.\r\n\r\nMy heart was beating forcibly. It seemed enormous. And with every\r\nbeat it would splash out such a thundering, such a hot, such a\r\njoyful wave! A flash: \"Let them, below there, let them toss and rush\r\nand yell and fall; what matter if something has fallen, if something\r\nhas been shattered to dust?-- Little matter! Only to remain this way\r\nand carry her, carry and carry....\"\r\n\r\n_The Same Evening, Twenty-two o'Clock._\r\n\r\nI hold my pen with great difficulty. Such an extraordinary fatigue\r\nafter all the dizzying events of this morning. Is it possible that\r\nthe strong, salutary, centuries-old walls of the United State have\r\nfallen? Is it possible that we are again without a roof over our\r\nheads, back in the wild state of freedom like our remote ancestors?\r\nIs it possible that we have lost our Well-Doer? \"Opposed!\" On the\r\nDay of Unanimity--opposed! I am ashamed of _them_, painfully,\r\nfearfully ashamed.... But who are \"they\"? And who am I? \"They,\"\r\n\"We\"...? Do I know?\r\n\r\nI shall continue.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting where I had brought her on the uppermost glass bench\r\nwhich was hot from the sun. Her right shoulder and the beginning of\r\nthe wonderful and incalculable curve were uncovered,--an exceedingly\r\nthin serpent of blood. She seemed not to be aware of the blood, or\r\nthat her breast was uncovered. No, I will say rather: she seemed\r\nto see all that and seemed to feel that it was essential to her,\r\nthat if her unif were buttoned she would have torn it, she would\r\nhave....\r\n\r\n\"And tomorrow!\" She breathed the words through sparkling white\r\nclenched teeth, \"Tomorrow, nobody knows what ... do you understand?\r\nNeither I nor anyone else knows; it is unknown! Do you realize what\r\na joy it is? Do you realize that all that was certain has come to an\r\nend? Now ... things will be new, improbable, unforeseen!\"\r\n\r\nBelow the human waves were still foaming, tossing, roaring, but they\r\nseemed to be very far away, and to be growing more and more distant.\r\nFor she was looking at me. She slowly drew me into herself through\r\nthe narrow, golden windows of her pupils. We thus remained silent\r\nfor a long while. And for some reason I recalled how once I watched\r\nsome queer yellow pupils through the Green Wall, while above the\r\nWall birds were soaring (or was this another time?).\r\n\r\n\"Listen, if nothing particular happens tomorrow, I shall take you\r\nthere; do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nNo, I did not understand but I nodded in silence. I was dissolved, I\r\nbecame infinitesimal, a geometrical point....\r\n\r\nAfter all, there is some logic,--a peculiar logic of today, in this\r\nstate of being a point. A point has more unknowns than any other\r\nentity. If a point should start to move, it might become thousands\r\nof curves, or hundreds of solids.\r\n\r\nI was afraid to budge. What might I have become if I had moved? It\r\nseemed to me that everybody like myself was afraid now of even the\r\nmost minute of motions.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, for instance, as I sit and write, everyone is\r\nsitting hidden in his glass cell, expecting something. I do not hear\r\nthe buzzing of the elevators, usual at this hour, or laughter or\r\nsteps, from time to time Numbers pass in couples through the hall,\r\nwhispering, on tip-toe....\r\n\r\nWhat will happen tomorrow? What will become of me tomorrow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-SIX\r\n\r\n  The World Does Exist\r\n  Rash\r\n  Forty-one Degrees Centigrade\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning. Through the ceiling the sky is as usual firm, round,\r\nred-cheeked. I think I should have been less surprised had I found\r\nabove some extraordinary quadrangular sun, or people clad in\r\nmany-colored dresses made of the skins of animals, or opaque walls\r\nof stone. Then the world, _our world_, does still exist? Or is it\r\nonly inertia? Is the generator already switched out, while the\r\narmature is still roaring and revolving;--two more revolutions, or\r\nthree, and at the fourth will it die away?\r\n\r\nAre you familiar with that strange state in which you wake up in\r\nthe middle of the night, open your eyes into the darkness and then\r\nsuddenly feel you are lost in the dark; you quickly, quickly begin\r\nto feel around, to seek something familiar and solid, a wall, a\r\nlamp, a chair? In exactly the same way I felt around, seeking in the\r\nJournal of the United State; quickly, quickly--I found this:\r\n\r\n\"The celebration of the Day of Unanimity, long awaited by all,\r\ntook place yesterday. The same Well-Doer who so often proved his\r\nunshakeable wisdom, was unanimously re-elected for the forty-eighth\r\ntime. The celebration was clouded by a little confusion, created by\r\nthe enemies of happiness, who by their action naturally lost the\r\nright to be the bricks for the foundation of the renovated United\r\nState. It is clear to everybody that to take into consideration\r\ntheir votes would mean to consider as a part of a magnificent,\r\nheroic symphony the accidental cough of a sick person who happened\r\nto be in a concert hall.\"\r\n\r\nOh, great Sage! Is it really true that despite everything we are\r\nsaved? What objection indeed can one find to this most crystalline\r\nsyllogism? And further on a few more lines:\r\n\r\n\"Today at twelve o'clock a joint meeting of the Administrative\r\nBureau, Medical Bureau, and Bureau of Guardians will take place. An\r\nimportant State decree is to be expected shortly.\"\r\n\r\nNo, the Walls still stand erect. Here they are! I can feel them. And\r\nthat strange feeling of being lost somewhere, of not knowing where\r\nI am--that feeling is gone. I am not surprised any longer to see\r\nthe sky blue and the sun round and all the Numbers going to work as\r\nusual....\r\n\r\nI walked along the avenue with a particularly firm resounding step.\r\nIt seemed to me that everyone else walked exactly like me. But at\r\nthe crossing, on turning the corner, I noticed people strangely\r\nshying away, going around the corner of a building sidewise, as if a\r\npipe had burst in the wall, as if cold water were spurting like a\r\nfountain on the sidewalk and it was impossible to cross it.\r\n\r\nAnother five or ten steps and I too felt a spurt of cold water\r\nthat struck me and threw me from the sidewalk; at a height of\r\napproximately two meters a quadrangular piece of paper was pasted to\r\nthe wall and on that sheet of paper,--unintelligible, poisonously\r\ngreen letters:\r\n\r\n_MEPHI_\r\n\r\nAnd under the paper,--an S-like curved back and wing-ears shaking\r\nwith anger or emotion. His right arm lifted as high as possible, his\r\nleft arm hopelessly stretched out backward like a hurt wing, he was\r\ntrying to jump high enough to reach the paper and tear it off but he\r\nwas unable to do so. He was a fraction of an inch too short.\r\n\r\nProbably every one of the passers-by had the same thought: \"If I go\r\nto help him, I, only one of the many, will he not think that I am\r\nguilty of something and that I am therefore anxious to....\"\r\n\r\nI must confess, I had that thought. But remembering how many times\r\nhe had proved my real Guardian-angel and how often he had saved\r\nme, I stepped towards him and with courage and warm assurance I\r\nstretched out my hand and tore off the sheet. S- turned around. The\r\nlittle drills sank quickly into me to the bottom and found something\r\nthere. Then he lifted his left brow, winked toward the wall where\r\n\"Mephi\" had been hanging a minute ago. The tail of his little smile\r\ntwinkled even with a certain pleasure which greatly surprised me.\r\nBut why should I be surprised? A doctor always prefers a temperature\r\nof 40°C. and a rash to the slow, languid rise of the temperature\r\nduring the period of incubation of a disease; it enables him to\r\ndetermine the character of the disease. _Mephi_ broke out today on\r\nthe walls like a rash. I understood his smile.\r\n\r\nIn the passage to the underground railway, under our feet on the\r\nclean glass of the steps again a white sheet: _Mephi_. And also on\r\nthe walls of the tunnel and on the benches and on the mirror of\r\nthe car. (Apparently pasted on in haste as some were hanging on a\r\nslant.) Everywhere the same white gruesome rash.\r\n\r\nI must confess that the exact meaning of that smile became clear to\r\nme only after many days which were overfilled with the strangest and\r\nmost unexpected events.\r\n\r\nThe roaring of the wheels, distinct in the general silence, seemed\r\nto be the noise of infected streams of blood. Some Number was\r\ninadvertently touched on the shoulder and he started so that a\r\npackage of papers fell out of his hands. To my left another Number\r\nwas reading a paper, his eyes fixed always on the same line; the\r\npaper perceptibly trembled in his hands. I felt that everywhere, in\r\nthe wheels, in the hands, in the newspapers, even in the eyelashes,\r\nthe pulse was becoming more and more rapid and I thought it\r\nprobable that today when I-330 and I should find ourselves _there_,\r\nthe temperature would rise to 39°, 40°, perhaps 41° and....\r\n\r\nAt the docks--the same silence filled with the buzzing of an\r\ninvisible propeller. The lathes were silent as if brooding. Only\r\nthe cranes were moving almost inaudibly as if on tip-toe, gliding,\r\nbending over, picking up with their tentacles the lumps of frozen\r\nair and loading the tanks of the _Integral_. We are already\r\npreparing the _Integral_ for a trial flight.\r\n\r\n\"Well, shall we have her up in a week?\" This was my question\r\naddressed to the Second Builder. His face is like porcelain, painted\r\nwith sweet blue and tender pink little flowers (eyes and lips), but\r\ntoday those little flowers looked faded and washed-out. We were\r\ncounting aloud when suddenly I broke off in the midst of a word and\r\nstopped, my mouth wide open; above the cupola, above the blue lump\r\nlifted by the crane, there was a scarcely noticeable small white\r\nsquare. I felt my whole body trembling--perhaps with laughter.\r\nYes! _I myself heard_ my own laughter. (Did you ever hear your own\r\nlaughter?)\r\n\r\n\"No, listen,\" I said. \"Imagine you are in an ancient aeroplane. The\r\naltimeter shows 5000 meters. A wing breaks; you are dashing down\r\nlike.... And on the way you calculate: 'Tomorrow from twelve to\r\ntwo ... from two to six ... and dinner at five!' Would it not be\r\nabsurd?\"\r\n\r\nThe little blue flowers began to move and bulge out. What if I were\r\nmade of glass and he could have seen what was going on within me at\r\nthat moment? If he knew that some three or four hours later....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-SEVEN\r\n\r\nNo Headings. It Is Impossible!\r\n\r\n\r\nI was alone in the endless corridors. In those same corridors.... A\r\nmute, concrete sky. Water was dripping somewhere upon a stone. The\r\nfamiliar heavy opaque door,--and the subdued noise from behind it.\r\n\r\nShe said she would come out at sixteen sharp. It was already five\r\nminutes, then ten, then fifteen past sixteen. No one appeared. For a\r\nsecond I was my former self, horrified at the thought that the door\r\nmight open.\r\n\r\n\"Five minutes more, and if she does not come out....\"\r\n\r\nWater was dripping somewhere upon a stone. No one about. With\r\nmelancholy pleasure I felt: \"saved,\" and slowly I turned and walked\r\nback along the corridor. The trembling dots of the small lamps on\r\nthe ceiling became dimmer and dimmer. Suddenly a quick rattle of a\r\ndoor behind me. Quick steps, softly echoing from the ceiling and the\r\nwalls. It was she, light as a bird, panting somewhat from running.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would be here, you would come! I knew you,--you....\"\r\n\r\nThe spears of her eyelashes moved apart to let me in and ... how can\r\nI describe what effect that ancient, absurd and wonderful rite has\r\nupon me when her lips touch mine? Can I find a formula to express\r\nthat whirlwind which sweeps out of my soul everything, everything\r\nsave her? Yes, yes from my _soul_. You may laugh at me if you will.\r\n\r\nShe made an effort to raise her eyelids and her slow words too came\r\nwith an effort:\r\n\r\n\"No. Now we must go.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened. Old, worn steps. An unbearably multicolored noise,\r\nwhistling and light....\r\n\r\n  * * * * *\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours have passed since then and everything seems to\r\nhave settled in me, yet it is most difficult for me to find words\r\nfor even an approximate description.... It is as though a bomb had\r\nexploded in my head.... Open mouths, wings, shouts, leaves, words,\r\nstones, all these one after another in a heap....\r\n\r\nI remember my first thought was: \"Fast--back!\" For it was clear\r\nto me that while I was waiting there in the corridors, _they_\r\nsomehow had blasted and destroyed the Green Wall, and from behind it\r\neverything rushed in and splashed over our city which until then had\r\nbeen kept clean of that lower world. I must have said something of\r\nthis sort to I-330. She laughed.\r\n\r\n\"No, we have simply come out _beyond the Green Wall_.\"\r\n\r\nThen I opened my eyes, and close to me, actually, I saw those very\r\nthings which until then not a single living Number had ever seen\r\notherwise than depreciated a thousand times, dimmed and hazy through\r\nthe cloudy glass of the Wall.\r\n\r\nThe Sun,--it was no longer our light, evenly diffused over the\r\nmirror surface of the pavements; it seemed an accumulation of living\r\nfragments, of incessantly oscillating, dizzy spots which blinded\r\nthe eyes. And the trees! Like candles rising into the very sky,\r\nor like spiders which squatted upon the earth, supported by their\r\nclumsy paws, or like mute green fountains. And all this was moving,\r\njumping, rustling. Under my feet some strange little ball was\r\ncrawling.... I stood as though rooted to the ground. I was unable to\r\ntake a step because under my foot there was not an even plane, but\r\n(imagine!), something disgustingly soft, yielding, living, springy,\r\ngreen!...\r\n\r\nI was dazed; I was strangled,--yes, strangled; it is the best word\r\nto express my state. I stood holding fast with both hands to a\r\nswinging branch.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing. It is all right. It is natural,--for the first time.\r\nIt will pass. Courage!\"\r\n\r\nAt I-330's side bouncing dizzily on a green net,--someone's thinnest\r\nprofile, cut out of paper. No, not \"someone's.\" I recognized him. I\r\nremembered. It was the doctor. I understood everything very clearly.\r\nI realized that they both caught me beneath the arms and laughingly\r\ndragged me forward. My legs twisted and glided.... Terrible noise,\r\ncawing, stumps, yelling, branches, tree-trunks, wings, leaves,\r\nwhistling....\r\n\r\nThe trees ran apart. A bright clearing. In the clearing, people, or\r\nperhaps to be more exact, _beings_. Now comes the most difficult\r\npart to describe for _this_ was beyond any bounds of probability. It\r\nis clear to me now why I-330 was stubbornly silent about it before;\r\nI should not have believed it, should not have believed even her. It\r\nis even possible that tomorrow I shall not believe myself, shall not\r\nbelieve my own description in these pages.\r\n\r\nIn the clearing, around a naked, skull-like rock,--a noisy crowd\r\nof three or four hundred ... people. Well, let's call them people.\r\nI find it difficult to coin new words. Just as on the stands\r\nyou recognize in the general accumulation of faces only those\r\nwhich are familiar to you, so at first I recognized only our\r\ngrayish-blue unifs. But one second later and I saw distinctly and\r\nclearly among the unifs dark, red, golden, black, brown and white\r\nhumans--apparently they were humans. None of them had any clothes\r\non, and their bodies were covered with short, glistening hair, like\r\nthat which may be seen on the stuffed horse in the Prehistoric\r\nMuseum. But their females had faces exactly, yes exactly, like\r\nthe faces of our women: tender, rosy and not overgrown with hair.\r\nAlso their breasts were free of hair, firm breasts of wonderful\r\ngeometrical form. As to the males, only a part of their faces were\r\nfree from hair, like our ancestors', and the organs of reproduction,\r\nsimilar to ours.\r\n\r\nAll this was so unbelievable, so unexpected, that I stood there\r\nquietly (I assert positively that I stood quietly), and looked\r\naround. Like a scale: overload one side sufficiently and then you\r\nmay gently put on the other as much as you will; the arrow will not\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt alone. I-330 was no longer with me. I don't know how\r\nnor where she disappeared. Around me were only _those_, with their\r\nhair glistening like silk in the sunlight. I caught someone's warm,\r\nstrong, dark shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, please, in the name of the Well-Doer, could you tell me\r\nwhere she went? A while, a minute ago she....\"\r\n\r\nLong-haired, austere eyebrows turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"Sh ... sh ... silence!\" He made a sign with his head towards the\r\ncentre where there stood the yellow, skull-like stone.\r\n\r\nThere above the heads of all I saw her. The sun beat straight into\r\nmy eyes, and because of that she seemed coal-black, standing out\r\non the blue cloth of the sky,--a coal-black silhouette on a blue\r\nbackground. A little higher the clouds were floating. And it seemed\r\nthat not the clouds but the rock itself, and she herself upon that\r\nrock, and the crowd and the clearing,--all were silently floating\r\nlike a ship, and the earth was light and glided away from under the\r\nfeet....\r\n\r\n\"Brothers!\" (It was she.) \"Brothers, you all know that there inside\r\nthe Wall, in the City, they are building the _Integral_. And you\r\nknow also that the day has come for us to destroy that Wall and all\r\nother walls, so that the green wind may blow all over the earth,\r\nfrom end to end. But the _Integral_ is going to take these walls\r\nup into the heights to the thousands of other worlds which every\r\nevening whisper to us with their lights through the black leaves of\r\nnight....\"\r\n\r\nWaves and foam and wind were beating the rock:\r\n\r\n\"Down with the _Integral!_ Down!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, brothers, not 'down'. The _Integral_ must be ours. And it\r\n_shall_ be ours. On the day when it first sets sail into the sky,\r\n_we_ shall be on board. For the Builder of the _Integral_ is with\r\nus. He left the walls, he came with me here in order to be with us.\r\nLong live the Builder!\"\r\n\r\nA second--and I was somewhere above everything. Under me: heads,\r\nheads, heads, wide open yelling mouths, arms rising and falling....\r\nThere was something strange and intoxicating in it all. I felt\r\nmyself _above everybody_; I was,--I,--a separate world; I ceased to\r\nbe the usual item; I became unity....\r\n\r\nAgain I was below, near the rock, my body happy, shaken and rumpled,\r\nas after an embrace of love. Sunlight, voices, and from above--the\r\nsmile of I-330. A golden-haired woman, her whole body silky-golden\r\nand diffusing an odor of different herbs, was near by. She held a\r\ncup, apparently made of wood. She drank a little from it with her\r\nred lips and then offered the cup to me. I closed my eyes and with\r\navidity I drank the sweet cold prickly sparks, pouring them down on\r\nthe fire which burned within me.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward my blood and the whole world began to circulate a\r\nthousand times faster; the earth seemed to be flying, light as down.\r\nAnd within me everything was simple, light and clear. Only then\r\nI noticed on the rock the familiar, enormous letters: M E P H I,\r\nand for some reason the inscription seemed to me _necessary_. It\r\nseemed to be a simple thread binding everything together. A rather\r\nrough picture hewn in the rock; this too, seemed comprehensible;\r\nit represented a youth with wings and with a transparent body, and\r\nin the place ordinarily occupied by the heart,--a blinding, red,\r\nblazing coal. Again, I understood that coal, or no, I _felt_ it as\r\nI felt without hearing every word of I-330 (she continued to speak\r\nfrom above, from the rock), and I felt that all of them breathed one\r\nbreath and that they were all ready to fly somewhere like the birds\r\nover the Wall.\r\n\r\nFrom behind, from the confusion of breathing bodies,--a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"But this is folly!\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me it was I, yes, I am certain it was I, who then jumped\r\non the rock; from there I saw the sun, heads, a green sea on a blue\r\nbackground, and I cried:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, precisely. All must become insane; we must become insane\r\nas soon as possible! We must; I know it.\"\r\n\r\nI-330 was at my side. Her smile--two dark lines from the angles of\r\nher mouth directed upward.... And within me a blazing coal. It was\r\nmomentary, light, a little painful, beautiful.... And later,--only\r\nstray fragments that remained sticking in me....\r\n\r\n... Very low and slowly a bird was moving. I saw it was living, like\r\nme. It was turning its head now to the right and then to the left\r\nlike a human being, and its round black eyes screwed themselves into\r\nme....\r\n\r\n... Then: a human back glistening with fur the color of ancient\r\nivory;--a mosquito crawling on that back, a mosquito with tiny\r\ntransparent wings. The back twitched to chase the mosquito away; it\r\ntwitched again....\r\n\r\n... And yet another thing: a shadow from the leaves, a woven,\r\nnet-like shadow. Some lay in that shadow, chewing something,\r\nsomething similar to the legendary food of the ancients, a long\r\nyellow fruit and a piece of something dark. They put some of it in\r\nmy hand, and it seemed droll to me for I did not know whether I\r\nmight eat it or not....\r\n\r\n... And again: a crowd, heads, legs, arms, mouths, faces appearing\r\nfor a second and disappearing like bursting bubbles. For a second\r\nappeared (or perhaps it was only an hallucination?) the transparent,\r\nflying wing-ears....\r\n\r\nWith all my might I pressed the hand of I-330. She turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is here! I thought, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"S-, a second ago, in the crowd.\"\r\n\r\nThe ends of the thin coal-black, brows moved to the temples--a smile\r\nlike a sharp triangle. I could not see clearly why she smiled. How\r\ncould she smile?\r\n\r\n\"But you understand, I-330, don't you, you understand what it means\r\nif he, or one of them is here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are funny! How could it ever enter the heads of those within\r\nthe Wall that we are here? Remember; take yourself. Did you ever\r\nthink it was possible? They are busy hunting us _there_,--let them!\r\nYou are delirious!\"\r\n\r\nHer smile was light and cheerful and I too, was smiling; the earth\r\nwas drunken, cheerful, light, floating....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-EIGHT\r\n\r\n  Both of Them\r\n  Entropy and Energy\r\n  The Opaque Part of the Body\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your world is similar to the world of the ancients, then you may\r\neasily imagine that one day you suddenly come upon a sixth or a\r\nseventh continent, upon some Atlantis, and you find there unheard\r\nof cities, labyrinths, people flying through the air without the\r\naid of wings or aeros, stones lifted into the air by the power of\r\na gaze,--in brief, imagine that you see things that cannot come to\r\nyour mind even if you suffer from dream-sickness. That is how I feel\r\nnow. For you must understand that no one has ever gone beyond the\r\nGreen Wall since the Two Hundred Years' War, as I already have told\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI know that it is my duty to you, my unknown friends, to give more\r\ndetails about that unsuspected strange world which opened to me\r\nyesterday. But for the time being I am unable to return to that\r\nsubject. Everything is so novel, so novel it is like a rainstorm,\r\nand I am not big enough to collect it all. I spread out the folds of\r\nmy unif, my palms,--and yet pailfuls splash past me and only drops\r\ncan reach these pages....\r\n\r\nAt first I heard behind me, behind the door, a loud voice. I\r\nrecognized her voice, the voice of I-330, tense, metallic--and\r\nanother one, almost inflexible, like a wooden ruler, the voice of\r\nU-. Then the door came open with a crack and both of them shot into\r\nthe room. _Shot_ is the right word.\r\n\r\nI-330 put her hand on the back of my armchair and smiled over her\r\nshoulder but only with her teeth, at U-. I should not care to stand\r\nbefore such a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" she said to me, \"this woman seems to have made it her\r\nbusiness to guard you from me like a little child. Is it with your\r\npermission?\"\r\n\r\n\"But he _is_ a child. Yes! That is why he does not notice that you\r\n... that it is only in order.... That all this is only a foul game!\r\nYes! And it is my duty....\"\r\n\r\nFor a second (in the mirror) the broken, trembling line of brows.\r\nI leaped, controlling with difficulty the other self within me,\r\nthe one with the hairy fists; with difficulty, pushing every word\r\nthrough my teeth, I cried straight into her face, into her very\r\ngills:\r\n\r\n\"Get out of here at once! Out! At once!\"\r\n\r\nThe gills swelled at first into brick-red lumps, then fell and\r\nbecame gray. She opened her mouth to say something but without a\r\nword she slammed it shut and went out.\r\n\r\nI threw myself towards I-330.\r\n\r\n\"Never, never will I forgive myself! She dared! You ... but you\r\ndon't think, do you, that you, that she.... This is all because she\r\nwants to register on me but I....\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately she will not have time for that now. Besides, even a\r\nthousand like her.... I don't care.... I know you will not believe\r\nthat thousand but only me. For after all that happened yesterday, I\r\nam all yours, all, to the very end, as you wanted it. I am in your\r\nhands; you can now at any moment....\"\r\n\r\n\"What, 'at any moment?'\" (But at once I understood what. My blood\r\nrushed to my ears and cheeks.) \"Don't speak about that, you must\r\nnever speak about that! The _other_ I, my former self ... but\r\nnow....\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know? Man is like a novel: up to the last page one does\r\nnot know what the end will be. It would not be worth reading\r\notherwise.\"\r\n\r\nShe was stroking my head. I could not see her face but I could\r\ntell by her voice that she was looking somewhere very far into\r\nthe distance; she hooked herself to that cloud which was floating\r\nsilently, slowly, no one knows where to.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she pushed me away with her hand, firmly but tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"Listen. I came to tell you that perhaps we are now ... our last\r\ndays.... You know, don't you, that all Auditoriums are to be closed\r\nafter tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Closed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I passed by and saw that in all Auditoriums preparations are\r\ngoing on: tables; medics all in white....\"\r\n\r\n\"But what does it all mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Nobody knows as yet. That is the worst of it. I only\r\nfeel the current is on, the spark is jumping, and if not today, then\r\ntomorrow.... Yet perhaps they will not have time....\"\r\n\r\nFor a long while I have ceased to understand who are _they_ and who\r\n_we_. I do not understand what I want; do I want them to have or not\r\nto have enough time? One thing is clear to me: I-330 is now on the\r\nvery edge, on the very edge, and in one second more....\r\n\r\n\"But it is folly,\" I said. \"You, versus the United State! It is the\r\nsame as if you should cover the muzzle of a gun with your hands and\r\nexpect that way to prevent the shot.... It is absolute folly!\"\r\n\r\nA smile.\r\n\r\n\"'We must all go insane,--as soon as possible go insane.' It was\r\nyesterday, do you remember?\"\r\n\r\nYes, she was right; I had even written it down. Consequently it\r\nreally took place. In silence I looked into her face. At that moment\r\nthe dark cross was especially distinct.\r\n\r\n\"I-, dear, before it is too late.... If you want ... I'll leave\r\neverything, I'll forget everything, and we'll go there beyond the\r\nWall, to _them_.... I do not even know who they are....\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. Through the dark windows of her eyes I saw\r\nwithin her a flaming oven, sparks, tongues of flame and above them a\r\nheap of dry, tarry wood. It was clear to me that it was too late, my\r\nwords could be of no avail.\r\n\r\nShe stood up. She would soon leave. Perhaps these were the last\r\ndays, or the last minutes.... I grasped her hand.\r\n\r\n\"No, stay a little while longer ... for the sake ... for the\r\nsake....\"\r\n\r\nShe slowly lifted my hand towards the light, my hairy paw which I\r\ndetest. I wanted to withdraw it but she held it tightly.\r\n\r\n\"Your hand.... You undoubtedly don't know and very few do know,\r\nthat women from here occasionally used to fall in love with _them_.\r\nProbably there are in you a few drops of that blood of the sun and\r\nthe woods. Perhaps that is why I....\"\r\n\r\nSilence. It was so strange that because of that silence, because of\r\nan emptiness, of nothing, my heart should beat so wildly. I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you shall not go yet! You shall not go until you tell me about\r\n_them_ ... for you love ... them, and I do not know even who they\r\nare, nor where they come from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they? The half we have lost. H2 and O, two halves; but\r\nin order to get water, H2O, creeks, seas, waterfalls, storms, it\r\nis necessary that those two halves be united.\"\r\n\r\nI distinctly remember every movement of hers. I remember she picked\r\nup a glass triangle from my table and while talking she pressed its\r\nsharp edge against her cheek; a white scar would appear; then it\r\nwould fill again and become pink and disappear. And it is strange\r\nthat I cannot remember her words, especially the beginning of the\r\nstory. I remember only different images and colors. At first,\r\nI remember, she told me about the Two Hundred Years' War. Red\r\ncolor.... On the green of the grass, on the dark clay, on the\r\npale blue of the snow,--everywhere red ditches that would not\r\nbecome dry. Then yellow; yellow grass burned by the sun, yellow\r\nnaked wild-men and wild dogs side by side near swollen cadavers\r\nof dogs or perhaps of men. All this, certainly beyond the Walls,\r\nfor the City was already the victor and it possessed already our\r\npresent-day petroleum food. And at night ... down from the sky\r\n... heavy black folds. The folds would swing over the woods, the\r\nvillages,--blackish-red slow columns of smoke. A dull moaning;\r\nendless strings of people driven into the City to be saved by force\r\nand to be whipped into happiness.\r\n\r\n\"... You knew almost all this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, almost.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you did not know and only a few did, that a small part of them\r\nremained together and stayed to live beyond the Wall. Being naked,\r\nthey went into the woods. They learned there from the trees, beasts,\r\nbirds, flowers and sun. Hair soon grew over their bodies, but under\r\nthat hair they preserved their warm red blood. With you it was\r\nworse; numbers covered your bodies; numbers crawled over you like\r\nlice. One ought to strip you of everything, and naked you ought to\r\nbe driven into the woods. You ought to learn how to tremble with\r\nfear, with joy, with wild anger, with cold; you should pray to fire!\r\nAnd we Mephi, we want....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wait a minute! 'Mephi,' what does it mean!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mephi? It is from Mephisto. You remember, there on the rock, the\r\nfigure of the youth? Or, no. I shall explain it to you in your own\r\nlanguage and you will understand better: there are two forces in\r\nthe world, entropy and energy. One leads into blessed quietude, to\r\nhappy equilibrium, the other to the destruction of equilibrium,\r\nto torturingly perpetual motion. Our, or rather your ancestors,\r\nthe Christians, worshipped entropy like a God. But we are not\r\nChristians, we....\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a slight whisper was suddenly heard, a knock at the\r\ndoor, and in rushed that flattened man with the forehead low over\r\nhis eyes, who several times had brought me notes from I-330. He ran\r\nstraight to us, stopped, panting like an air-pump, and could say not\r\na word, as he must have been running at top speed.\r\n\r\n\"But tell me! What has happened?\" I-330 grasped him by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming here,--\" panted the air-pump, \"with guards.... And\r\nwith them that what's-his-name, the hunchback....\"\r\n\r\n\"S-?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They are in the house by this time. They'll soon be here.\r\nQuick, quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, we have time!\" I-330 was laughing, cheerful sparks in her\r\neyes. It was either absurd, senseless courage, or else there was\r\nsomething I did not yet understand.\r\n\r\n\"I-, dear, for the sake of the Well-Doer! You must understand that\r\nthis....\"\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of the Well-Doer!\" The sharp, triangle-smile.\r\n\r\n\"Well ... well, for my sake, I implore you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I wanted to talk to you about some other matters.... Well,\r\nnever mind.... We'll talk about them tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd cheerfully (yes cheerfully) she nodded to me; the other came out\r\nfor a second from under his forehead's awning and nodded also. I was\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nQuick! To my desk! I opened this manuscript, took the pen so that\r\nthey should find me at this work which is for the benefit of\r\nthe United State. Suddenly I felt every hair on my head living,\r\nseparated, moving: \"What if they should read, even one page of these\r\nmost recently written?\"\r\n\r\nMotionless I sat at the table but everything around me seemed to\r\nbe moving, as if the less than microscopic movements of the atoms\r\nsuddenly were magnified millions of times, and I saw the walls\r\ntrembling, my pen trembling and the letters swinging and fusing\r\ntogether. \"To hide them! But where?\" Glass all around. \"To burn\r\nthem?\" But they would notice the fire through the corridor and in\r\nthe neighboring room. Besides I felt unable, I felt too weak, to\r\ndestroy this torturing and perhaps dearest piece of my own self....\r\n\r\nVoices from a distance (from the corridor) and steps. I had only\r\ntime to snatch a handful of pages and put them under me, and then as\r\nif soldered to the armchair, every atom of which was quivering, I\r\nremained sitting, while the floor under my feet rolled like the deck\r\nof a ship, up and down....\r\n\r\nAll shrunk together and hidden under the awning of my own forehead\r\nlike that messenger, I watched them stealthily; they were going from\r\nroom to room, beginning at the right end of the corridor. Nearer\r\n... nearer.... I saw that some sat in their rooms, torpid like me;\r\nothers would jump up and open their doors wide,--lucky ones! If only\r\nI too, could....\r\n\r\n\"The Well-Doer is the most perfect fumigation humanity needs,\r\nconsequently no peristalsis in the organism of the United State\r\ncould....\" I was writing this nonsense, pressing my trembling pen\r\nhard, and lower and lower my head bent over the table, and within me\r\nsome sort of crazy forge.... With my back I was listening ... and\r\nI heard the click of the door-knob.... A current of fresh air....\r\nMy armchair was dancing a mad dance.... Only then, and even then\r\nwith difficulty, I tore myself away from the page, turned my head\r\nin the direction of the newcomers (how difficult it is to play\r\na foul game!). In front of all was S-, morose, silent, swiftly\r\ndrilling with his eyes deep shafts within me, within my armchair\r\nand within the pages which were twitching in my hands. Then for a\r\nsecond--familiar, everyday faces at the door; one of them separated\r\nitself from the rest with its bulging, pinkish-brown gills....\r\n\r\nAt once I recalled everything that happened in the same room half an\r\nhour ago and it was clear to me that they would presently....\r\n\r\nAll my being was shriveling and pulsating in that fortunately opaque\r\npart of my body with which I was covering the manuscript. U- came up\r\nto S-, gently plucked his sleeve and said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"This is D-503, the builder of the _Integral_. You have probably\r\nheard of him. He is always like that, at his desk; does not spare\r\nhimself at all!\"\r\n\r\n... And I thought!... What a dear, wonderful woman!...\r\n\r\nS- slid up to me, bent over my shoulder toward the table. I covered\r\nthe lines I had written with my elbow but he shouted severely:\r\n\r\n\"Show us at once what you have there, please!\"\r\n\r\nDying with shame, I held out the sheet of paper. He read it over,\r\nand I noticed a tiny smile jump out of his eyes, jump down his face\r\nand slightly wagging its tail, perch upon the right angle of his\r\nmouth....\r\n\r\n\"Somewhat ambiguous, yet.... Well, you may continue; we shall not\r\ndisturb you any more.\"\r\n\r\nHe went splashing towards the door as if in a ditch of water. And\r\nwith every step of his I felt coming back to me my legs, my arms,\r\nmy fingers,--my soul again distributed itself evenly over my whole\r\nbody; I breathed....\r\n\r\nThe last thing: U- lingered in my room to come back to me and say in\r\nmy very ear in a whisper: \"It is lucky for you that I....\"\r\n\r\nI did not understand. What did she mean by that? The same evening I\r\nlearned that they led away three Numbers, although nobody speaks out\r\nloud about that, or about anything that happened. This ostensible\r\nsilence is due to the educational influence of the Guardians who are\r\never present among us. Conversations deal chiefly with the quick\r\nfall of the barometer and the forthcoming change in the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD TWENTY-NINE\r\n\r\n  Threads on the Face\r\n  Sprouts\r\n  An Unnatural Compression\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is strange: the barometer continues to fall yet there is no\r\nwind. There is quiet. Above, the storm which we do not yet hear has\r\nbegun. The clouds are rushing with a terrific speed. There are few\r\nof them as yet; separate fragments; it is as if there above us an\r\nunknown city were being destroyed and pieces of walls and towers\r\nwere rushing down, coming nearer and nearer with terrific speed,\r\nbut it will take some days of rushing through the blue infinite\r\nbefore they reach the bottom, that is us, below. And below there is\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThere are thin, incomprehensible, almost invisible threads in the\r\nair; every autumn they are brought here from beyond the Wall. They\r\nfloat slowly, and suddenly you feel something foreign and invisible\r\non your face; you want to brush it off, but no, you cannot rid\r\nyourself of it. You feel it especially near the Green Wall, where I\r\nwas this morning. I-330 made an appointment with me to meet her in\r\nthe Ancient House in that \"Apartment\" of ours.\r\n\r\nI was not far from the rust-red, opaque mass of the Ancient House,\r\nwhen I heard behind me short hasty steps and rapid breathing. I\r\nturned around and saw O-90 trying to catch up to me. She seemed\r\nstrangely and perfectly rounded. Her arms and breast, her whole\r\nbody, so familiar to me, was rounded out, stretching her unif. It\r\nseemed as though it would soon tear the thin cloth and come out into\r\nthe sun, into the light. I think that there in the green debris, in\r\nspringtime, the unseen sprouts try thus to tear their way through\r\nthe ground in order to emit their branches and leaves and to bloom.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds she shone into my face with her blue eyes in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"I saw you on the Day of Unanimity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw you, too.\" I at once remembered; below, in a narrow passage\r\nshe had stood, pressing herself to the wall, protecting her abdomen\r\nwith her arms, and automatically I glanced now at her abdomen which\r\nrounded the unif. She must have noticed, for she became pink, and\r\nwith a rosy smile:\r\n\r\n\"I am so happy ... so happy! I am so full of ... you understand, I\r\nam ... I walk and I hear nothing around me.... And all the while I\r\nlisten within, within me....\"\r\n\r\nI was silent. Something foreign was shadowing my face and I was\r\nunable to rid myself of it. Suddenly, all shining, light blue, she\r\ncaught my hand; I felt her lips upon it.... It was for the first\r\ntime in my life.... It was some ancient caress as yet unknown to\r\nme.... And I was so ashamed and it pained me so much that I swiftly,\r\nI think even roughly, pulled my hand away.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, you are crazy, it seems.... And anyway you ... what are you\r\nhappy about? Is it possible that you forget what is ahead of you? If\r\nnot now, then within a month or two....\"\r\n\r\nHer light went out, her roundness sagged and shrank. And in my\r\nheart an unpleasant, even a painful compression, mixed with pity.\r\nOur heart is nothing else than an ideal pump: a compression, i.e.,\r\na shrinking at the moment of pumping, is a technical absurdity.\r\nHence it is clear how essentially absurd, unnatural and pathological\r\nare all these \"loves\" and \"pities,\" etc., etc., which create that\r\ncompression....\r\n\r\nSilence. To the left the cloudy green glass of the Wall. And just\r\nahead the dark red mass. Those two colors combined, gave me as a\r\nresultant what I thought was a splendid idea.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! I know how to save you! I shall save you from.... To see\r\none's own child for a few moments only and then be sent to death!\r\nNo! You shall be able to bring it up! You shall watch it and see it\r\ngrow in your arms, and ripen like a fruit....\"\r\n\r\nHer body quivered and she seemed to have chained herself to me.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember that woman, I-330? That ... of ... of long ago?...\r\nWho during that walk?... Well, she is now right here, in the\r\nAncient House. Let us go to her and I assure you that I shall\r\narrange matters at once.\"\r\n\r\nI already pictured us, I-330 and I, leading O-90 through the\r\ncorridors ... then how she would be brought amidst flowers, grass,\r\nand leaves.... But O-90 stepped back, the little horns of her rosy\r\ncrescent trembling and bending downward.\r\n\r\n\"Is she _that same one_?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"That is....\" I was confused for some reason. \"Yes, of course ...\r\nthat very same....\"\r\n\r\n\"And you want me to go to _her_, to ask her ... to.... Don't you\r\never dare to say another word about it!\"\r\n\r\nLeaning over, she walked away.... Then as if she remembered\r\nsomething, she turned around and cried:\r\n\r\n\"I shall die; be it so! And it is none of your business ... what do\r\nyou care?\"\r\n\r\nSilence. From above pieces of blue towers and walls were falling\r\ndownward with terrific speed ... they will have perhaps hours or\r\ndays to fly through the infinite.... Unseen threads were slowly\r\nfloating through the air, planting themselves upon my face, and it\r\nwas impossible to brush them off, impossible to rid myself of them.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly toward the Ancient House and in my heart I felt that\r\nabsurd, tormenting compression....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY\r\n\r\n  The Last Number\r\n  Galileo's Mistake\r\n  Would It Not Be Better?\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is my conversation with I-330, which took place in the Ancient\r\nHouse yesterday in the midst of loud noise, among colors which\r\nstifled the logical course of my thoughts, red, green, bronze,\r\nsaffron-yellow, orange colors.... And all the while under the\r\nmotionless marble smile of that snub-nosed ancient poet.\r\n\r\nI shall reproduce the conversation word by word, for it seems to\r\nme that it may have an enormous and decisive importance for the\r\nfate of the United State,--more than that, for the fate of the\r\nuniverse. Besides, reading it, you my unknown readers, may find some\r\njustification for me. I-330, without preliminaries, at once threw\r\neverything upon my head:\r\n\r\n\"I know that the day after tomorrow the first trial trip of the\r\n_Integral_ is to take place. On that day we shall take possession of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Day after tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Sit down and don't be upset. We cannot afford to lose a\r\nminute. Among the hundreds who were arrested yesterday there are\r\ntwenty Mephis. To let pass two or three days means that they will\r\nperish.\"\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\n\"As observers on the trial trip they will send electricians,\r\nmechanicians, physicians, meteorologists, etc.... At twelve sharp,\r\nyou must remember this, when the bell rings for dinner we shall\r\nremain in the passage, lock them all up in the dining hall, and the\r\n_Integral_ will be ours. You realize that it is most necessary,\r\nhappen what may! The _Integral_ in our hands will be a tool that\r\nwill help to put an end to everything at once without pain.... Their\r\naeros?... Bah! They would be insignificant mosquitos against a\r\nbuzzard. And then, if it proves inevitable, we may direct the tubes\r\nof the motors downward and by their work alone....\"\r\n\r\nI jumped up.\r\n\r\n\"It is inconceivable! It is absurd! Is it not clear to you that what\r\nyou are contriving is a revolution?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a revolution. Why is it absurd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absurd? because a revolution is impossible! Because _our_ (I speak\r\nfor myself and for you), our revolution was the last one. No other\r\nrevolutions may occur. Everybody knows that.\"\r\n\r\nA mocking, sharp triangle of brows.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, you are a mathematician, are you not? More than that, a\r\nphilosopher-mathematician? Well then, name the last number!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is ... I ... I cannot understand, which _last_?\"\r\n\r\n\"The last one, the highest, the largest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I-330, it is absurd! Since the number of numbers is infinite,\r\nhow can there be a last one?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why then do you think there is a _last_ revolution? There is\r\nno last revolution, their number is infinite.... The 'last one' is\r\na children's story. Children are afraid of the infinite, and it is\r\nnecessary that children should not be frightened, so that they may\r\nsleep through the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the use, what is the use of it all? For the sake of the\r\nWell-Doer! What is the use since all are happy already?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right! Even suppose that is so. What further?\"\r\n\r\n\"How funny! A purely childish question. You tell something to\r\nchildren, come to the very end, yet they will invariably ask you,\r\n'what further?' and 'what for?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Children are the only courageous philosophers. And courageous\r\nphilosophers are invariably children. One ought always to ask like\r\nchildren, 'what further'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing further! Period. In the whole world evenly, everywhere,\r\nthere is distributed....\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, 'evenly!' 'Everywhere!' That is the point, entropy!\r\nPsychological entropy. Don't you as a mathematician know that only\r\ndifferences (only differences!), in temperature, only thermic\r\ncontrasts make for life? And if all over the world there are evenly\r\nwarm or evenly cold bodies, they must be pushed off! ... in order\r\nto get flame, explosions! And we shall push!...\"\r\n\r\n\"But I-330, please realize that our ancestors during the Two Hundred\r\nYears' War did exactly that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they were right! A thousand times right! They did one wrong\r\nthing, however; later they began to believe that they were the _last\r\nnumber_, a number that does not exist in nature. Their mistake was\r\nthe mistake of Galileo; he was right in that the earth revolves\r\nabout the sun but he did not know that our whole solar system\r\nrevolves about some other centre, he did not know that the real (not\r\nrelative) orbit of the earth is not a naive circle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, the Mephi?\"\r\n\r\n\"We? For the time being we know that there is no _last_ number. We\r\nmay forget that some day. Of course, we shall certainly forget it\r\nwhen we grow old, as everything inevitably grows old. Then we shall\r\ninevitably fall like autumn leaves from the trees, like you the\r\nday-after-tomorrow.... No, no dear, not you personally. You are with\r\nus, are you not? You are with us?\"\r\n\r\nFlaming, stormy, sparkling! I never before had seen her in such a\r\nstate. She embraced me with her whole self; I disappeared.\r\n\r\nHer last word, looking steadily, deeply into my eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Then, do not forget: at twelve o'clock sharp.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I answered:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\r\n\r\nShe left. I was alone amidst a rebellious, multi-voiced commotion of\r\nblue, red, green, saffron-yellow and orange....\r\n\r\nYes, at twelve!... Suddenly a feeling of something foreign on\r\nmy face, of something implanted, that could not be brushed off.\r\nSuddenly, yesterday morning, and U- and all she shouted into the\r\nface of I-330! Why, how absurd!\r\n\r\nI hastened to get out of the house and home, home! Somewhere behind\r\nme I heard the chattering of birds beyond the Wall. And ahead of me\r\nin the setting sun the balls of cupolas made of red, crystallized\r\nfire, enormous flaming cubes--houses, and the sharp point of the\r\nAccumulating Tower high in the sky like a paralyzed streak of\r\nlightning. And all this, all this impeccable, most geometric beauty,\r\nshall I, I myself, with my hands...? Is there no way out? No path?\r\nNo trail?\r\n\r\nI passed by an auditorium (I do not recall its number). Inside, the\r\nbenches were stacked along the walls. In the middle, tables covered\r\nwith snow-white glass sheets, with pink stains of sunny blood on\r\nthe white.... There was foreshadowed in all that some unknown and\r\ntherefore alarming tomorrow. It is unnatural for a thinking and\r\nseeing human being to live among irregularities, unknowns, X's. If\r\nsuddenly your eyes were covered with a bandage and you were let go\r\nto feel around, to stumble, ever aware that somewhere very close\r\nto you there is the border-line, one step only and nothing but a\r\ncompressed, smothered piece of flesh will be left of you.... I now\r\nfeel somewhat like that.\r\n\r\n... And what if without waiting for anything I should ... just head\r\ndown.... Would it not be the only right thing to do? To disentangle\r\neverything at once?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-ONE\r\n\r\n  The Great Operation\r\n  I Forgave Everything\r\n  The Collision of Trains\r\n\r\n\r\nSaved! At the very last moment, when it seemed that there was\r\nnothing to hold to, that it was the end!...\r\n\r\nIt was as if you already ascended the steps towards the threatening\r\nmachine of the Well-Doer, or as if the great glass Bell with a heavy\r\nthud already covered you, and for the last time in life you looked\r\nat the blue sky to swallow it with your eyes ... when suddenly, it\r\nwas only a dream! The sun is pink and cheerful and the wall ... what\r\nhappiness to be able to touch the cold wall! And the pillow! To\r\ndelight endlessly in the little cavity formed by your own head in\r\nthe white pillow!... This is approximately what I felt, when I read\r\nthe State Journal this morning. It has been all a terrible dream\r\nand this dream is over. And I was so feeble, so unfaithful, that I\r\nthought of selfish, voluntary death! I am ashamed now to reread the\r\nlast lines of yesterday. But let them remain as a memory of that\r\nincredible might-have-happened, which will not happen! On the front\r\npage of the State Journal the following gleamed:\r\n\r\n\"REJOICE!\r\n\r\n\"For from now on we are _perfect!_\r\n\r\n\"Before today your own creation, engines, were more perfect than\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\"WHY?\r\n\r\n\"For every spark from a dynamo--is a spark of pure reason; each\r\nmotion of a piston--a pure syllogism. Is it not true that the same\r\nfaultless reason is within you?\r\n\r\n\"The philosophy of the cranes, presses, and pumps is finished\r\nand clear like a circle. But is your philosophy less circular?\r\nThe beauty of a mechanism lies in its immutable, precise rhythm,\r\nlike that of a pendulum. But have you not become as precise as a\r\npendulum, you who are brought up on the system of Taylor?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but there is one difference:\r\n\r\n\"MECHANISMS HAVE NO FANCY\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever notice a pump cylinder during its work show upon its\r\nface a wide, distant, sensuously-dreaming smile? Did you ever hear\r\ncranes restlessly toss about and sigh at night, during the hours\r\ndesigned for rest?\r\n\r\n\"NO!\r\n\r\n\"Yet on your faces (you may well blush with shame!), the Guardians\r\nhave seen more and more frequently those smiles and they have\r\nheard your sighs. And (you should hide your eyes for shame!) the\r\nhistorians of the United State all tendered their resignations so as\r\nto be relieved from having to record such shameful occurrences.\r\n\r\n\"It is not your fault; you are ill. And the name of your illness is\r\n\r\n\"FANCY\r\n\r\n\"It is a worm that gnaws black wrinkles on one's forehead. It is a\r\nfever that drives one to run farther and farther, albeit 'farther'\r\nmay begin where happiness ends. It is the last barricade on our road\r\nto happiness.\r\n\r\n\"_Rejoice! This Barricade Has Been Blasted at Last! The Road is\r\nOpen!_\r\n\r\n\"The latest discovery of our State science is that there is a centre\r\nfor fancy,--a miserable little nervous knot in the lower region of\r\nthe frontal lobe of the brain. A triple treatment of this knot with\r\nX-rays will cure you of fancy--\r\n\r\n\"_Forever!_\r\n\r\n\"You are perfect; you are mechanized; the road to hundred per-cent\r\nhappiness is open! Hasten then all of you, young and old, hasten to\r\nundergo the great Operation! Hasten to the auditoriums where the\r\ngreat Operation is being performed! Long live the Great Operation!\r\nLong live the United State! Long live the Well-Doer.\"\r\n\r\nYou, had you read all this not in my records which look like an\r\nancient strange novel, had you like me held in your trembling hands\r\nthe newspaper, smelling of typographic ink ... if you knew as I do,\r\nthat all this is most certain reality, if not the reality of today,\r\nthen that of tomorrow,--would you not feel the very things I feel?\r\nWould not your head whirl as mine does? Would there not run over\r\nyour back and arms those strange, sweet, icy needles? Would you not\r\nfeel that you were a giant, an Atlas?--that if only you stood up and\r\nstraightened out you would reach the ceiling with your head?\r\n\r\nI snatched the telephone receiver.\r\n\r\n\"I-330. Yes.... Yes. Yes ... 330!\" And then, swallowing my own words\r\nI shouted, \"Are you at home? Yes? Have you read? You are reading\r\nnow? Is it not, is it not stupendous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes....\" A long, dark silence. The wires buzzed almost imperceptibly.\r\nShe was thinking.\r\n\r\n\"I must see you today without fail. Yes, in my room, after sixteen,\r\nwithout fail!\"\r\n\r\nDear ... she is such a dear!... \"Without fail!\" I was smiling and I\r\ncould not stop, I felt I should carry that smile with me into the\r\nstreet like a light above my head.\r\n\r\nOutside the wind ran over me, whirling, whistling, whipping, but\r\nI felt even more cheerful. \"All right, go on, go on moaning and\r\ngroaning! The Walls cannot be torn down.\" Flying leaden clouds broke\r\nover my head ... well let them! They could not eclipse the sun! We\r\nchained it to the zenith like so many Joshuas, sons of Nuns!\r\n\r\nAt the corner a group of Joshuas, sons of Nuns, were standing with\r\ntheir foreheads pasted to the glass of the wall. Inside, on a\r\ndazzling white table already a Number lay. One could see two naked\r\nsoles diverging from under the sheet in a yellow angle.... White\r\nmedics bent over his head,--a white hand, a stretched-out hand\r\nholding a syringe filled with something....\r\n\r\n\"And you, what are you waiting for?\" I asked nobody in particular,\r\nor rather all of them.\r\n\r\n\"And you?\" Someone's round head turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"I? Oh, afterward! I must first....\" Somewhat confused, I left the\r\nplace. I really had to see I-330 first. But why first? I could not\r\nexplain to myself....\r\n\r\nThe docks. The _Integral_, bluish like ice, was glistening and\r\nsparkling. The engine was caressingly grumbling, repeating some one\r\nword, as if it were my word, a familiar one. I bent down and stroked\r\nthe long, cold tube of the motor. \"Dear! What a dear tube! Tomorrow\r\nit will come to life, tomorrow for the first time it will tremble\r\nwith burning, flaming streams in its bowels.\"\r\n\r\nWith what eyes would I have looked at the glass monster had\r\neverything remained as it was yesterday? If I knew that tomorrow at\r\ntwelve I should betray it, yes, betray.... Someone behind cautiously\r\ntouched my elbow. I turned around. The plate-like, flat face of the\r\nSecond Builder.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know already?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"What? About the Operation? Yes. How everything, everything ...\r\nsuddenly....\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not that. The trial flight is put off until day-after-tomorrow,--on\r\naccount of that Operation. They rushed us for nothing; we hurried....\"\r\n\r\n\"On account of that Operation!\" Funny, limited man. He could see\r\nno farther than his own platter! If only he knew that but for the\r\nOperation tomorrow at twelve he would be locked-up in a glass cage,\r\nwould be tossing about, trying to climb the walls!\r\n\r\nAt twelve-thirty when I came into my room I saw U-. She was sitting\r\nat my table, firm, straight, bone-like, resting her right cheek on\r\nher hand. She must have waited for a long while because when she\r\nbrusquely rose to meet me there remained on her cheek five white\r\nimprints of her fingers.\r\n\r\nFor a second that terrible morning came back to me; she beside\r\nI-330, indignant. But for a second only. All was at once washed off\r\nby the sun of today, as it happens sometimes when you enter your\r\nroom on a bright day and absent-mindedly turn on the light, the bulb\r\nshines but it is out of place, droll, unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation I held out my hand to her; I forgave her\r\neverything. She firmly grasped both my hands and pressed them\r\ntill they hurt. Her cheeks quivering and hanging down like ancient\r\nprecious ornaments, she said with emotion:\r\n\r\n\"I was waiting.... I want only one moment.... I only wanted to say\r\n... how happy, how joyous I am for you! You realize of course, that\r\ntomorrow or day-after-tomorrow you will be healthy again, as if born\r\nanew.\"\r\n\r\nI noticed my papers on the table; the last two pages of my record\r\nof yesterday; they were in the place where I left them the night\r\nbefore. If only she knew what I wrote there! Although I did not care\r\nafter all. Now it was only history; it was the ridiculously far off\r\ndistance like an image through a reversed opera-glass.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"a while ago, while passing through the avenue, I saw\r\na man walking ahead of me. His shadow stretched along the pavement\r\nand think of it! his shadow was luminous! I think, more than that,\r\nI am absolutely certain that tomorrow all shadows will disappear.\r\nNot a shadow from any person or any thing! The sun will be shining\r\nthrough everything.\"\r\n\r\nShe, gently and earnestly:\r\n\r\n\"You are a dreamer! I should not allow my children in school to talk\r\nthat way.\"\r\n\r\nShe told me something about the children; that they were all led\r\nin one herd to the Operation; that it was necessary to bind them\r\nafterward with ropes; and that one must love pitilessly, \"yes,\r\npitilessly,\" and that she thought she might finally decide to....\r\n\r\nShe smoothed out the grayish-blue fold of the unif that fell between\r\nher knees, swiftly pasted her smiles all over me and went out.\r\n\r\nFortunately the sun did not stop today. The sun was running. It was\r\nalready sixteen o'clock.... I was knocking at the door, my heart was\r\nknocking....\r\n\r\n\"Come in!\"\r\n\r\nI threw myself upon the floor near her chair, to embrace her limbs,\r\nto lift my head upward and look into her eyes, first into one then\r\ninto the other, and in each of them to see the reflection of myself\r\nin wonderful captivity....\r\n\r\nThere beyond the wall it looked stormy, there the clouds were\r\nleaden,--let them be! My head was overcrowded with impetuous\r\nwords, and I was speaking aloud, and flying with the sun I knew\r\nnot where.... No, now we know where we are flying; planets were\r\nfollowing me, planets sparkling with flame and populated with fiery,\r\nsinging flowers and mute planets, blue ones where rational stones\r\nwere unified into one organized society, and planets which like\r\nour own earth had reached already the apex of one hundred per-cent\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from above:\r\n\r\n\"And don't you think that at the apex are, precisely, _stones_\r\nunified into an organized society?\" The triangle grew sharper and\r\nsharper, darker and darker.\r\n\r\n\"Happiness ... well?... Desires are tortures, are they not? It is\r\nclear therefore, that happiness is where there are no longer any\r\ndesires, not a single desire any more. What an error, what an absurd\r\nprejudice it was, that formerly we would mark happiness with the\r\nsign 'plus'! No, absolute happiness must be marked 'minus,'--divine\r\nminus!\"\r\n\r\nI remember I stammered unintelligibly:\r\n\r\n\"Absolute zero!--minus 273°C.\"\r\n\r\n\"Minus 273°--exactly! A somewhat cool temperature. But does it not\r\nprove that we are at the summit?\"\r\n\r\nAs before she seemed somehow to speak for me and through me,\r\ndeveloping to the end my own thoughts. But there was something so\r\nmorbid in her tone that I could not refrain ... with an effort I\r\ndrew out a \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, \"You, you are mocking....\"\r\n\r\nShe burst out laughing loudly, too loudly. Swiftly, in a second,\r\nshe laughed herself to some unseen edge, stumbled and fell over....\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nShe stood up, put her hands upon my shoulders and looked into me for\r\na long while. Then she pulled me toward her and everything seemed to\r\nhave disappeared save her sharp, hot lips....\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThe words came from afar, from above, and reached me not at once,\r\nonly after a minute, perhaps two minutes later.\r\n\r\n\"Why ... why 'good-bye'?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been ill, have you not? Because of me you have committed\r\ncrimes. Has not all this tormented you? And now you have the\r\nOperation to look forward to. You will be cured of me. And that\r\nmeans--good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" I cried.\r\n\r\nA pitilessly sharp black triangle on a white background.\r\n\r\n\"What? Do you mean that you don't want happiness?\"\r\n\r\nMy head was breaking into pieces; two logical trains collided and\r\ncrawled upon each other, rattling and smothering....\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am waiting. You must choose; the Operation and hundred\r\nper-cent happiness, or....\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot ... without you.... I must not ... without you....\" I\r\nsaid, or perhaps I only thought, I am not sure which, but I-330\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" she said. Then, her hands still on my shoulders and\r\nher eyes not letting my eyes go, \"Then ... until tomorrow. Tomorrow\r\nat twelve. You remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it was postponed for a day. Day-after-tomorrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better for us. At twelve, day-after-tomorrow!\"\r\n\r\nI walked alone in the dusky street. The wind was whirling,\r\ncarrying, driving me like a piece of paper; fragments of the leaden\r\nsky were soaring, soaring--they had to soar through the infinite for\r\nanother day or two....\r\n\r\nUnifs of Numbers were brushing my sides,--yet I was walking alone.\r\nIt was clear to me that all were saved but that there was no\r\nsalvation for me. For I _do not want_ salvation....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-TWO\r\n\r\n  I Do Not Believe\r\n  Tractors\r\n  A Little Human Splinter\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you believe that _you will die_? Oh, yes, \"Man is mortal. I am a\r\nman, consequently....\" No, not that; I know that; you know it. But I\r\nask: has it ever happened that you _actually believed_ it? Believed\r\ndefinitely, believed not with your reason but with your _body_, that\r\nyou actually felt that some day those fingers which now hold this\r\npage, will become yellow, icy?...\r\n\r\nNo, of course you cannot believe this. That is why you have not\r\njumped from the tenth floor to the pavement before now, that is why\r\nyou eat, turn over these pages, shave, smile, write.\r\n\r\nThis very thing, yes, exactly this is alive in me today. I know that\r\nthat small black hand on the clock will slide down here towards\r\nmidnight, then again it will start to ascend, and it will cross\r\nsome last border and the improbable tomorrow will have arrived. I\r\n_know_ it, but somehow I do not _believe_ it, or perhaps I think\r\nthat twenty-four hours are twenty-four years. Therefore I am still\r\nable to act, to hurry, to answer questions, to climb the rope-ladder\r\nto the _Integral_. I am still able to feel how the latter is shaking\r\nthe surface of the water, and I still understand that I must grasp\r\nthe railing, and I am still able to feel the cold glass in my hand.\r\nI see the transparent, living cranes, bending their long necks,\r\ncarefully feeding the _Integral_ with the terrible explosive food\r\nwhich the motors need. I still see below on the river the blue veins\r\nand knots of water swollen by the wind.... Yet all this seems very\r\ndistant from me, foreign, flat,--like a draught on a sheet of paper.\r\nAnd it seems to me strange, when the flat, draught-like face of the\r\nSecond Builder, suddenly asks:\r\n\r\n\"Well, then. How much fuel for the motors shall we load on? If we\r\ncount on three, or say three and a half hours....\"\r\n\r\nI see before me, over a draught, my hand with the counter and the\r\nlogarithmic dial at the figure 15.\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen tons. But you'd better take ... yes, better take a\r\nthousand.\"\r\n\r\nI said that because I _know_ that tomorrow.... I noticed that my\r\nhands and the dial began to tremble.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand! What do you need such a lot for? That would last a\r\nweek! No, more than a week!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, nobody knows....\"\r\n\r\nI do know....\r\n\r\nThe wind whistled, the air seemed to be stuffed to the limit with\r\nsomething invisible. I had difficulty in breathing, difficulty in\r\nwalking, and with difficulty, slowly but without stopping for a\r\nsecond the hand of the Accumulating Tower was crawling, at the\r\nend of the avenue. The peak of the Tower reached into the very\r\nclouds;--dull, blue, groaning in a subdued way, sucking electricity\r\nfrom the clouds. The tubes of the Musical Tower resounded.\r\n\r\nAs always--four abreast. But the rows did not seem as firm as usual;\r\nthey were swinging, bending more and more, perhaps because of the\r\nwind. There! They seemed to have stumbled upon something at the\r\ncorner, and they drew back and stopped, congealed, a close mass, a\r\nclot, breathing rapidly; at once all had stretched their necks like\r\ngeese.\r\n\r\n\"Look! No look, look--there, quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"_They?_ Are those _they_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, never! Never! I'd rather put my head straight into the\r\nMachine....\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence! Are you crazy?\"\r\n\r\nOn the corner the doors of the auditorium were ajar, a heavy column\r\nof about fifty people--. The word \"people\" is not the right one.\r\nThese were heavy-wheeled automatons bound in iron and moved by an\r\ninvisible mechanism. Not people but a sort of human-like tractor.\r\nOver their heads, floating in the air--a white banner with a golden\r\nsun embroidered on it, and the rays of the sun: \"We are the first!\r\nWe have already been operated upon! Follow us, all of you!\"\r\n\r\nThey slowly, unhesitatingly mowed through the crowd, and it was\r\nclear that if they had had in their way a wall, a tree, a house,\r\nthey would have moved on with no more hesitation through wall, tree\r\nor house. In the middle of the avenue they fused and stretched out\r\ninto a chain, arm in arm, their faces turned towards us. And we,\r\na human clot, tense, the hair pricking our heads, we waited. Our\r\nnecks were stretched out goose-fashion. Clouds. The wind whistled.\r\nSuddenly the wings of the chain from right and left bent quickly\r\naround us, and faster, faster, like a heavy engine descending a\r\nhill, they closed the ring and pulled us toward the yawning doors\r\nand inside....\r\n\r\nSomebody's piercing cry: \"They are driving us in! Run!\"\r\n\r\nAll ran. Close to the wall there still was an open living gate of\r\nhuman beings. Everybody dashed through it, heads forward. Their\r\nheads became sharp wedges, so with their ribs, shoulders, hips....\r\nLike a stream of water compressed in a firehose they spurted out\r\nin the form of a fan,--and all around me stamping feet, raised\r\narms, unifs.... The double-curved S- with his transparent wing-ears\r\nappeared for a moment close before my eyes; he disappeared as\r\nsuddenly; I was alone among arms and legs appearing for a second and\r\ndisappearing. I was running....\r\n\r\nI dashed to the entrance of a house to stop for a breath, my back\r\nclose to the door,--and immediately, like a splinter borne by the\r\nwind, a human being was thrown towards me.\r\n\r\n\"All the while I ... I have been following you. I do not want ... do\r\nyou see? I do not want ... I am ready to....\"\r\n\r\nSmall round hands on my sleeves, round dark blue eyes--it was O-90.\r\nShe just slipped along my body like a unif which, its hanger broken,\r\nslips along the wall to fall upon the floor. Like a little bundle\r\nshe crumpled below me on the cold door-step, and I stood over her,\r\nstroking her head, her face,--my hands were wet. I felt as if I\r\nwere very big and she very small, a small part of myself. I felt\r\nsomething quite different from what I feel towards I-330. I think\r\nthat the ancients must have had similar feelings towards their\r\nprivate children.\r\n\r\nBelow, passing through her hands with which she was covering her\r\nface, a voice came to me:\r\n\r\n\"Every night I ... I cannot! If they cure me.... Every night I sit\r\nin the darkness alone and think of _him_, and of what he will look\r\nlike when I.... If cured I should have nothing to live with--do you\r\nunderstand me? You must ... you must....\"\r\n\r\nAn absurd feeling yet it was there; I really must! Absurd, because\r\nthis \"duty\" of mine was nothing but another crime. Absurd, because\r\nwhite and black cannot be one, duty and crime cannot coincide. Or\r\nperhaps there is no black and white in life, but everything depends\r\nupon the first logical premise? If the premise is that I unlawfully\r\ngave her a child....\r\n\r\n\"It is all right, but don't, only don't ...\" I said. \"Of course I\r\nunderstand.... I must take you to I-330, as I once offered to, so\r\nthat she....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" (This in a low voice, without uncovering her face.)\r\n\r\nI helped her rise. Silently we went along the darkening street, each\r\nbusy with his own thoughts, or perhaps with the same thought.... We\r\nwalked between silent leaden houses, through the tense, whipping\r\nbranches of the wind....\r\n\r\nThrough the whistling of the wind all at once I heard, as if\r\nsplashing through ditches, the familiar footsteps coming from some\r\nunseen point. At the corner I turned around, and among the clouds,\r\nflying upside-down reflected in the dim glass of the pavement I saw\r\nS-. Instantly my arms became foreign, swinging out of time, and\r\nI began to tell O-90 in a low voice that tomorrow, yes tomorrow,\r\nwas the day of the first flight of the _Integral_, and that it was\r\nto be something that never happened before in all history, great,\r\nmiraculous.\r\n\r\n\"Think of it! For the first time in life to find myself outside\r\nthe limits of our city and see--who knows what is beyond the Green\r\nWall?\"\r\n\r\nO-90 looked at me extremely surprised, her blue eyes trying to\r\npenetrate mine; she looked at my senselessly swinging arms. But\r\nI did not let her say a word,--I kept talking, talking.... And\r\nwithin me, apart from what I was saying and audible only to myself a\r\nthought was feverishly buzzing and knocking. \"Impossible! You must\r\nsomehow ... you must not lead _him_ to I-330!\"\r\n\r\nInstead of turning to the right I turned to the left. The bridge\r\nsubmissively bent its back in a slavish way to all three of us,\r\nto me, to O-, to him behind. Lights were falling from the houses\r\nacross the water, falling and breaking into thousands of sparks\r\nwhich danced feverishly, sprayed with the mad white foam of the\r\nwater. The wind was moaning like a tensely stretched string of a\r\ndouble-basso somewhere not far away. Through this basso, behind, all\r\nthe while....\r\n\r\nThe house where I live. At the entrance O- stopped and began:\r\n\r\n\"No! You promised, did you not, that....\"\r\n\r\nI did not let her finish. Hastily I pushed her through the entrance\r\nand we found ourselves in the lobby. At the controller's desk--the\r\nfamiliar, hanging, excitedly quivering cheeks, a group of Numbers\r\naround. They were quarreling about something, heads bending over the\r\nbanisters on the second floor; they were running downstairs one by\r\none. But about that later. I at once drew O-90 into the opposite,\r\nunoccupied corner and sat down with my back to the wall. I saw a\r\ndark large-headed shadow gliding back and forth over the sidewalk. I\r\ntook out my notebook. O-90 in her chair was slowly sinking as if she\r\nwere evaporating from under her unif, as if her body were thawing,\r\nas if only her empty unif were left, and empty eyes taking one into\r\nthe blue emptiness. In a tired voice:\r\n\r\n\"Why did you bring me here? You lied to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not so loud! Look here! Do you see? Through the wall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see a shadow.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is always following me.... I cannot.... Do you understand? I\r\ncannot therefore ... I am going to write a few words to I-330. You\r\ntake the note and go alone. I know he will remain here.\"\r\n\r\nHer body began again to take form and to move beneath the unif; on\r\nher face a faint sunrise, dawn. I put the note between her cold\r\nfingers, pressed her hand firmly and for the last time looked into\r\nher blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye. Perhaps some day....\" She freed her hand. Slightly\r\nbending over she slowly moved away, made two steps, turned around\r\nquickly and again we were side by side. Her lips were moving; with\r\nher lips and with her eyes she repeated some inaudible word. What an\r\nunbearable smile! What suffering!\r\n\r\nThen the bent-over human splinter went to the door; a bent-over\r\nlittle shadow beyond the wall; without turning around she went on\r\nfaster, still faster....\r\n\r\nI went to U-'s desk. With emotion filling up her indignant gills she\r\nsaid to me:\r\n\r\n\"They have all gone crazy! He, for instance, is trying to assure me\r\nthat he himself saw a naked man covered with hair near the Ancient\r\nHouse....\"\r\n\r\nA voice from the group of empty raised heads;\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I repeat it, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think of that? Oh, what a delirium!\" The\r\nword \"delirium\" came out of her mouth so full of conviction, so\r\nunbending, that I asked myself: \"Perhaps it really was nothing but\r\ndelirium, all that has been going on around me of late?\" I glanced\r\nat my hairy hand and I remembered: \"There are, undoubtedly, some\r\ndrops of that blood of the sun and woods in you. That is why perhaps\r\nyou....\" No, fortunately it was not delirium; or no, _un_fortunately\r\nit was not delirium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-THREE\r\n\r\nThis without a Synopsis, Hastily, the Last\r\n\r\n\r\n_The day._\r\n\r\nQuick, to the newspaper! perhaps there.... I read the paper with\r\nmy eyes (exactly; my eyes now are like a pen, or like a counting\r\nmachine which you hold and feel in your hands like a tool, something\r\nforeign, an instrument). In the newspaper on the first page, in\r\nlarge print:\r\n\r\n\"THE ENEMIES OF HAPPINESS ARE AWAKE! HOLD TO YOUR HAPPINESS WITH\r\nBOTH HANDS. TOMORROW ALL WORK WILL STOP AND ALL THE NUMBERS ARE TO\r\nCOME TO BE OPERATED UPON. THOSE WHO FAIL TO COME WILL BE SUBMITTED\r\nTO THE MACHINE OF THE WELL-DOER.\"\r\n\r\nTomorrow! How can there be, how can there be any tomorrow?\r\n\r\nFollowing my daily habit, I stretched out my arm (instrument!)\r\nto the bookshelf to put today's paper with the rest in a cover\r\nornamented with gold. While doing this: \"What for? What does it\r\nmatter? Never again shall I.... In this cover, never....\" And out of\r\nmy hands, down to the floor it fell.\r\n\r\nI stood looking all around, over all my room; hastily I was taking\r\naway, feverishly putting into some unseen valise everything I\r\nregretted leaving here: my desk, my books, my chair. Upon that chair\r\nsat I-330 that day; I was below on the floor.... My bed.... Then\r\nfor a minute or two I stood and waited for some miracle to happen;\r\nperhaps the telephone would ring, perhaps she would say that.... But\r\nno, no miracle....\r\n\r\nI am leaving, going into the unknown. These are my last lines.\r\nFarewell you, my unknown beloved ones, with whom I have lived\r\nthrough so many pages, before whom I have bared my diseased soul,\r\nmy whole self to the last broken little screw, to the last cracked\r\nspring.... I am going....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-FOUR\r\n\r\n  The Forgiven Ones\r\n  A Sunny Night\r\n  A Radio-Walkyrie\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, if only I actually had broken myself to pieces! If only I\r\nactually had found myself with her in some place beyond the Wall,\r\namong beasts showing their yellow tusks; if only I actually had\r\nnever returned here! It would be a thousand, a million times easier!\r\nBut now--what? Now to go and choke that--! But would it help? No,\r\nno, no! Take yourself in hand, D-503! Set into yourself the firm\r\nlogical hub; at least for a short while weigh heavily with all your\r\nmight on the lever, and like the ancient slave, turn the millstones\r\nof syllogisms until you have written down and understood everything\r\nthat happened....\r\n\r\nWhen I boarded the _Integral_, everybody was already there and\r\neverybody occupied his place; all the cells of the gigantic hive\r\nwere filled. Through the glass of the decks,--tiny, ant-like\r\npeople below, at the telegraph, dynamo, transformers, altimeters,\r\nventilators, indicators, motor, pumps, tubes.... In the saloon\r\npeople sitting over tables and instruments, probably those\r\ncommissioned by the Scientific Bureau. Near them the Second Builder\r\nand his two aides. All three had their heads down between their\r\nshoulders like turtles, their faces gray, autumnal, rayless.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, somewhat uncanny,\" replied one of them smiling a gray rayless\r\nsmile, \"Perhaps we shall have to land in some unknown place. And,\r\ngenerally speaking, nobody knows....\"\r\n\r\nI hardly could bear to look at them, when in an hour or so I was to\r\nthrow them out with my own hands, to cast them out from the cozy\r\nfigures of our Tables of Hours, forever to tear them away from\r\nthe mother's breast of the United State. They reminded me of the\r\ntragic figures of \"The Three Forgiven Ones\"--a story known to all\r\nof our school-children. It tells about three Numbers, who by way of\r\nexperiment were exempted for a whole month from any work.[3] \"Go\r\nwherever you will, do what you will,\" they were told. The unhappy\r\nthree wandered the whole time about the place of their usual work\r\nand gazed within with hungry eyes. They would stop on the plazas\r\nand for hours busy themselves repeating the motions which they were\r\nused to making during certain hours of the day; it became a bodily\r\nnecessity for them to do so. They would saw and plane the air; with\r\nunseen sledge-hammers they would bang upon unseen stakes. Finally,\r\non the tenth day they could bear it no longer; they took one another\r\nby the hand, entered the river, and to the accompaniment of the\r\nMarch they waded deeper and deeper until the water forever ended\r\ntheir sufferings.\r\n\r\n[3] It happened long ago, in the third century A. T. (After the\r\nTables).\r\n\r\nI repeat, it was hard for me to look at them, and I was anxious to\r\nleave them.\r\n\r\n\"I just want to take a glance into the engine-room, and then off!\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThey were asking me questions: What voltage should be used for the\r\ninitial spark, how much ballast water was needed in the tank aft.\r\nAs if a phonograph were somewhere within me, I was giving quick\r\nand precise answers but _I_, my inner self, was busy with its own\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nIn the narrow passage gray unifs were passing, gray faces and for a\r\nsecond, one face with its hair low over the forehead, eyes gazing\r\nfrom deep beneath it--it was _that same man_. I understood: _they_\r\nhad come and there was no escape from it for me; only minutes\r\nremained, a few dozens of minutes.... An infinitesimal, molecular\r\nquiver of my whole body. This did not cease to the very end,--it was\r\nas if an enormous motor were placed under the very foundation of my\r\nbody which was so light that the walls, partitions, cables, beams,\r\nlights--everything was quivering....\r\n\r\nI did not yet know whether _she_ was there. But I had no time....\r\nThey were calling me: quick! To the commander's bridge; time to go\r\n... where?\r\n\r\nGray, rayless faces. Below in the water--tense blue veins. Heavy,\r\ncast-iron patches of sky. It was so difficult to lift my cast-iron\r\nhand and take up the receiver of the commander's telephone!... \"Up!\r\nForty-five degrees!\"\r\n\r\nA heavy explosion--a jerk--a rabid greenish-white mountain of water\r\naft--the deck beneath my feet began to move, soft as rubber; and\r\neverything below, the whole life, forever.... For a second, falling\r\ndeeper and deeper into a sort of funnel, becoming more and more\r\ncompressed--the icy-blue relief-map of the City, the round bubbles\r\nof cupolas, the lonely leaden finger of the Accumulating Tower....\r\nThen instantaneously a cotton curtain of cloud.... We pierced it,\r\nand there was the sun and the blue sky! Seconds, minutes, miles--the\r\nblue was hardening, fast filling with darkness; like drops of cold\r\nsilver sweat appeared the stars....\r\n\r\nA sad, unbearably bright, black, starry, sunny night.... As if one\r\nhad become deaf, one still saw that the pipes were roaring, but\r\none only saw, dead silence all about. The sun was mute. It was\r\nnatural, of course. One might have expected it; we were beyond the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere. The transition was so quick, so sudden\r\nthat everyone became timid and silent. Yet I ... I thought I felt\r\neven easier under that fantastic, mute sun. I had bounded over the\r\ninevitable border, having left my body somewhere there below, and\r\nI was soaring bodiless to a new world, where everything was to be\r\ndifferent, upside down.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the same course!\" I shouted into the engine-room, or perhaps\r\nit was not I but a phonograph in me, and the same machine with a\r\nmechanical, hinge-like movement handed the commander's trumpet to\r\nthe Second Builder. All permeated by that most delicate, molecular\r\nquiver known only to me, I ran down the companionway, to seek....\r\n\r\nThe door of the saloon.... An hour later it was to latch and lock\r\nitself.... At the door stood an unfamiliar Number. He was small,\r\nwith a face like a hundred or a thousand others which are usually\r\nlost in a crowd, but his arms were exceptionally long,--they reached\r\ndown to the knees as though by mistake they had been taken from\r\nanother set of human organs and fastened to his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe long arm stretched out and barred the way.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you want to go?\"\r\n\r\nIt was clear that he was not aware I knew everything. All right!\r\nPerhaps it was necessary that it should be so. From above him, in a\r\ndeliberately significant tone I said:\r\n\r\n\"I am the Builder of the _Integral_ and I am directing the test\r\nflight. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nThe arm drew away.\r\n\r\nThe saloon. Heads covered with bristles, gray iron bristles, and\r\nyellow heads, and bald, ripe heads were bent over the instruments\r\nand maps. Swiftly, with a glance, I gathered them in with my\r\neyes, off I ran, back along the long passage, then through the\r\nhatch into the engine-room. There it was hot from the red tubes,\r\noverheated by the explosions; a constant roar,--the levers were\r\ndancing their desperate drunken dance, quivering ceaselessly with\r\na barely noticeable quiver; the arrows on the dials.... There! At\r\nlast! Near the tachometer, a notebook in his hand, was that man with\r\nthe low forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" I shouted straight into his ear (because of the roar), \"Is\r\nshe here? Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She? There at the radio.\"\r\n\r\nI dashed over there. There were three of them, all with receiving\r\nhelmets on. And she seemed a head taller than usual, wingy,\r\nsparkling, flying like an ancient walkyrie, and those bluish sparks\r\nfrom the radio seemed to emanate from her,--from her also that\r\nethereal, lightning-like odor of ozone.\r\n\r\n\"Someone--well, you for instance,\" I said to her, panting from\r\nhaving run, \"I must send a message down to earth, to the docks.\r\nCome, I shall dictate it to you.\"\r\n\r\nClose to the apparatus there was a small box-like cabin. We sat at\r\nthe table side by side. I found her hand and pressed it hard.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is going to happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Do you realize how wonderful it is? To fly without\r\nknowing where ... no matter where? It will soon be twelve o'clock\r\nand nobody knows what.... And when night.... Where shall you and I\r\nbe tonight? Perhaps somewhere on the grass, on dry leaves....\"\r\n\r\nBlue sparks emanated from her and the odor of lightning, and the\r\nvibration became more and more frequent within me.\r\n\r\n\"Write down,\" I said loudly, panting (from having run), \"Time:\r\neleven-twenty; speed 5800....\"\r\n\r\n\"Last night she came to me with your note. I know ... I know\r\neverything; don't talk.... But the child is yours. I sent her over;\r\nshe is already beyond the Wall. She will live....\"\r\n\r\nI was back on the commander's bridge, back in the delirious night\r\nwith its black, starry sky and its dazzling sun. The hands of\r\nthe clock on the table were slowly moving from minute to minute.\r\nEverything was permeated by a thin, hardly perceptible quivering\r\n(only I noticed it). For some reason a thought passed through\r\nmy head: it would be better if all this took place not here but\r\nsomewhere below, nearer to earth.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" I commanded.\r\n\r\nWe kept moving by inertia, but more and more slowly. Now the\r\n_Integral_ was caught for a second by an imperceptible little\r\nhair--for a second it hung motionless, then the little hair broke\r\nand the _Integral_ like a stone dashed downward with increasing\r\nspeed. That way in silence, minutes, tens of minutes passed. My\r\npulse was audible; the hand of the clock before my eyes came closer\r\nand closer to twelve. It was clear to me I was a stone; I-330 the\r\nearth; and the stone was under irresistible compulsion to fall\r\ndownward, to strike the earth and break into small particles. What\r\nif...? Already the hard blue smoke of the clouds appeared below....\r\nWhat if...? But the phonograph within me with a hinge-like motion\r\nand precision took the telephone and commanded: \"Low speed!\" The\r\nstone ceased falling. Only the four lower tubes were growling, two\r\nahead and two aft, only enough to hold the _Integral_ motionless,\r\nand the _Integral_, only slightly trembling, stopped in the air as\r\nif anchored, about one kilometer from the earth.\r\n\r\nEverybody came out on deck, (it was shortly before twelve, before\r\nthe sounding of the dinner-gong) and leaned over the glass railing;\r\nhastily, in huge gulps, they swallowed the unknown world which lay\r\nbelow, beyond the Green Wall. Amber, blue, green, the autumnal\r\nwoods, prairies, a lake. At the edge of a little blue saucer, some\r\nlone yellow debris, a threatening, dried-out yellow finger,--it must\r\nhave been the tower of an ancient \"church\" saved by a miracle....\r\n\r\n\"Look, there! Look! There to the right!\"\r\n\r\nThere (over the green desert) a brown blot was rapidly moving. I\r\nheld a telescope in my hands and automatically I brought it to my\r\neyes: the grass reaching their chests, a herd of brown horses was\r\ngalloping, and on their back--_they_, black, white, and dark....\r\n\r\nBehind me:\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, I saw a face!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go away! Tell it to someone else!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, look for yourself! Here is the telescope.\"\r\n\r\nThey had already disappeared. Endless green desert, and in\r\nthat desert, dominating it completely and dominating me, and\r\neverybody--the piercing vibrations of the gong; dinner time, one\r\nminute to twelve.\r\n\r\nFor a second the little world around me became incoherent,\r\ndispersed. Someone's brass badge fell to the floor. It mattered\r\nlittle. Soon it was under my heel. A voice: \"And I tell you, it was\r\na face!\" A black square, the open door of the main saloon. White\r\nteeth pressed together, smiling.... And at that moment, when the\r\nclock began slowly, holding its breath between beats, to strike,\r\nand when the front rows began to move towards the dining saloon,\r\nthe rectangle of the door was suddenly crossed by the two familiar,\r\nunnaturally long arms:\r\n\r\n\"STOP!\"\r\n\r\nSomeone's fingers sank piercing into my palm. It was I-330. She was\r\nbeside me.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it, do you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he not ... is he not?...\"\r\n\r\nHe was already lifted upon somebody's shoulders. Above a hundred\r\nother faces, his face like hundreds, like thousands of other faces\r\nyet unique among the rest....\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Guardians! You, to whom I talk, _they_ hear me,\r\nevery one of them hears me,--I talk to you: _we know_! We don't know\r\nyour numbers yet but we know everything else. The _Integral_ shall\r\nnot be yours! The test flight will be carried out to the end and you\r\nyourselves, you will not dare to make another move! You with your\r\nown hands will help to go on with the test and afterward ... well, I\r\nhave finished!\"\r\n\r\nSilence. The glass plates under my feet seemed soft, cotton-like.\r\nMy feet too,--soft, cotton-like. Beside me--she with a dead-white\r\nsmile, angry blue sparks. Through her teeth to me:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! It is your work! You did your 'duty'! Well....\" She tore her\r\nhand from mine; the walkyrie helmet with indignant wings was soon to\r\nbe seen some distance in front of me. I was alone, torpid, silent.\r\nLike everyone else I followed into the dining saloon.\r\n\r\nBut it was not I, not I! I told nobody, save these white, mute\r\npages.... I cried this to her within me, inaudibly, desperately,\r\nloudly. She was across the table, directly opposite me and not once\r\ndid she even touch me with her gaze. Beside her, someone's ripe,\r\nyellow, bald head. I heard (it was I-330's voice):\r\n\r\n\"'Nobility' of character! But my dear professor, even a superficial\r\netymological analysis of the word shows that it is a superstition, a\r\nremnant of the ancient feudal epoch. We....\"\r\n\r\nI felt I was growing pale,--and that they would soon notice it.\r\nBut the phonograph within me performed the prescribed fifty chewing\r\nmovements for every bite. I locked myself into myself as though\r\ninto an opaque house; I threw up a heap of rocks before my door and\r\nlowered the window-blinds....\r\n\r\nAfterward, again the telephone of the commander was in my hands\r\nand again we made the flight with icy, supreme anxiety through the\r\nclouds into the icy, starry, sunny night. Minutes, hours passed....\r\nApparently all that time the logical motor within me was working\r\nfeverishly at full speed. For suddenly somewhere at a distant point\r\nof the dark blue space I saw my desk, and the gill-like cheeks of U-\r\nover it and the forgotten pages of my records! It became clear to\r\nme; nobody but she ... everything was clear to me!\r\n\r\nIf only I could reach the radio-room soon ... wing-like helmets,\r\nthe odor of blue lightnings ... I remember telling her something in\r\na low voice and I remember how she looked _through_ me and how her\r\nvoice seemed to come from a distance:\r\n\r\n\"I am busy. I am receiving a message from below. You may dictate\r\nyours to her.\"\r\n\r\nThe small, box-like little cabin.... I thought for a second and then\r\ndictated in a firm voice:\r\n\r\n\"Time 14:40. Going down. Motors stopped. The end of all.\"\r\n\r\nThe commander's bridge. The machine-heart of the _Integral_ stopped;\r\nwe were falling; my heart could not catch up and would remain\r\nbehind and rise higher and higher into my throat.... Clouds.... And\r\nthen a distant green spot--everything green, more and more distinct,\r\nrunning like a storm towards us. \"Soon the end.\"\r\n\r\nThe porcelain-like white distorted face of the Second Builder!\r\nIt was he who struck me with all his strength; I hurt my head on\r\nsomething; and through the approaching darkness while falling I\r\nheard:\r\n\r\n\"Full speed--aft!\"\r\n\r\nA brusque jolt upward....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-FIVE\r\n\r\n  In a Ring\r\n  A Carrot\r\n  A Murder\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not sleep all night. The whole night but one thought.... As\r\na result of yesterday's mishap my head is tightly bandaged,--it\r\nseems to me not a bandage but a ring, a pitiless ring of glass-iron,\r\nriveted about my head. And I am busy with the same thought, always\r\nthe same thought in my riveted circle: to kill U-. To kill U-\r\nand then go to her and say: \"Now do you believe?\" What is most\r\ndisquieting is that to kill is dirty, primitive. To break her head\r\nwith something--the thought of it gives me a peculiar sensation of\r\nsomething disgustingly sweet in my mouth, and I am unable to swallow\r\nmy saliva; I am always spitting into my handkerchief, yet my mouth\r\nfeels dry.\r\n\r\nI had in my closet a heavy piston-rod which cracked during the\r\ncasting and which I brought home in order to find out the cause of\r\nthe cracking with a microscope. I made my manuscript into a tube\r\n(let her read me to the last letter!), pushed the broken piston into\r\nthat tube and went downstairs. The stairway seemed endless, the\r\nsteps disgustingly slippery, liquid. I had to wipe off moisture\r\nfrom my mouth very frequently. Downstairs ... my heart dropped. I\r\ntook out the piston and went to the controller's table, but she was\r\nnot there; instead an empty, icy desk with ink-blots. I remembered\r\nthat today all work was stopped; everybody was to go to be operated\r\nupon. Hence there was no need for her to stay here. There was nobody\r\nto be registered....\r\n\r\nThe street. It was windy. The sky seemed to be composed of soaring\r\npanels of cast-iron. And exactly as it seemed for one moment\r\nyesterday, the whole world was broken up into separate, sharp,\r\nindependent fragments, and each of these fragments was falling at\r\nfull speed; each would stop for a second, hang before me in the\r\nair and disappear without trace. It was as if the black, precise\r\nletters on this page should suddenly move apart and begin to jump\r\nhither and thither in fright, so that there was not a word on the\r\npage, only nonsensical \"ap,\" \"jum,\" \"wor.\" The crowd seemed just\r\nas nonsensical, dispersed (not in rows), going forward, backward,\r\ndiagonally, transversely....\r\n\r\nThen nobody. For a second while I was dashing at full speed,\r\nsuddenly stopping, I saw on the second floor in the glass cage\r\nhanging in the air,--a man and a woman--a kiss; she standing with\r\nher whole body bent backward brokenly: \"This is for the last time,\r\nforever....\"\r\n\r\nAt a corner a thorny, moving bush of heads. Above the heads,\r\nseparate, floating in the air, a banner: \"Down with the machines!\r\nDown with the Operation!\" And (distinct from my own self) I thought:\r\n\"Is it possible that each one of us bears such a pain, that it can\r\nbe removed only with his heart.... That something must be done to\r\neach one, before he....\" For a second everything disappeared for me\r\nfrom the world, except my beast-like hand with the heavy cast-iron\r\npackage it held....\r\n\r\nA boy appeared. He was running, a shadow under his lower lip. The\r\nlower lip turned out like the cuff of a rolled-up sleeve. His face\r\nwas distorted; he wept loudly; he was running away from somebody.\r\nStamping of feet was heard behind him....\r\n\r\nThe boy reminded me: \"U- must be in school. I must hurry!\" I ran\r\nto the nearest opening of the Underground Railway. At the entrance\r\nsomeone passed me and said, \"Not running. No trains today ...\r\nthere!\" I descended. A sort of general delirium was reigning. The\r\nglitter of cut-crystal suns; the platform packed closely with heads.\r\nAn empty, torpid train.\r\n\r\nIn the silence--a voice. I could not see her but I knew, I knew that\r\nintense, living, flexible, whip-like, flogging voice! I felt there\r\nthat sharp triangle of brows drawn to the temples....\r\n\r\n\"Let me! Let me reach her! I must!...\"\r\n\r\nSomeone's tentacles caught my arm, my shoulders. I was nailed. In\r\nthe silence I heard:\r\n\r\n\"No. Go up to them. There they will cure you; there they will\r\noverfeed you with that leavened happiness. Satiated, you will\r\nslumber peacefully, organized, keeping time and snoring sweetly. Is\r\nit possible that you do not yet hear that great symphony of snoring?\r\nFoolish people! Don't you realize that they want to liberate you\r\nfrom these gnawing, worm-like, torturing question marks? And you\r\nremain standing here and listening to me? Quick! Up! To the Great\r\nOperation! What is your concern, if I remain here alone? What does\r\nit matter to you if I want to struggle, hopelessly struggle? So much\r\nthe better! What does it matter to you that I do not want others\r\nto desire for me? I want to desire for myself. If I desire the\r\nimpossible....\"\r\n\r\nAnother voice, slow, heavy:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the impossible! Which means to run after your stupid fancies;\r\nthose fancies would whirl from under your very noses like a tail.\r\nNo, we shall catch that tail, and then....\"\r\n\r\n\"And then--swallow it and fall snoring; a new tail will become\r\nnecessary. They say the ancients had a certain animal which they\r\ncalled 'Ass.' In order to make it go forward they would attach a\r\ncarrot to a bow held in front of its nose, so that it could not\r\nreach it.... If it had caught and swallowed it....\"\r\n\r\nThe tentacles suddenly let me go; I threw myself towards the place\r\nshe was speaking from; but at that very moment everything was\r\nbrought to confusion. Shouts from behind: \"They are coming here!\r\nComing here!\" The lights twinkled and went out,--someone cut the\r\ncable,--and everything was like a lava of cries, groaning, heads,\r\nfingers....\r\n\r\nI do not know how long we were rolled about that way in the\r\nunderground tube. I only remember that steps were felt, dusk\r\nappeared, becoming brighter and brighter, and again we were in the\r\nstreet, dispersing fan-wise in different directions.\r\n\r\nAgain I was alone. Wind. Gray, low twilight crawling over my head.\r\nIn the damp glass of the sidewalk, somewhere very deep, there were\r\nlight topsy-turvy walls and figures moving along, feet upward. And\r\nthat terribly heavy package in my hands pulled me down into that\r\ndepth to the bottom.\r\n\r\nAt the desk again. U- was not yet there; her room was dark and\r\nempty. I went up to my room and turned on the light. My temples\r\ntightly bound by the iron ring were pulsating. I paced and paced,\r\nalways in the same circle: my table, the white package on the table,\r\nthe bed, my table, the white package on the table.... In the room\r\nto my left the curtains were lowered. To my right: the knotty bald\r\nhead over a book, the enormous parabolic forehead. Wrinkles on the\r\nforehead like a series of yellow, illegible lines. At times our eyes\r\nmet and then I felt that those lines were about me.\r\n\r\n... It happened at twenty-one o'clock exactly. U- came in on her\r\nown initiative. I remember that my breathing was so loud that I\r\ncould hear it and that I wanted to breathe less noisily but was\r\nunable to.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and arranged the fold of her unif on her knees. The\r\npinkish-brown gills were waving.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, is it true that you are wounded? I just learned about it,\r\nand at once I ran....\"\r\n\r\nThe piston was before me on the table. I jumped up, breathing even\r\nlouder. She heard, and stopped half-way through a word and rose.\r\nAlready I had located the place on her head; something disgustingly\r\nsweet was in my mouth.... My handkerchief! I could not find it. I\r\nspat on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe fellow with the yellow fixed wrinkles which think of me! It was\r\nnecessary that he should not see. It would be even more disgusting\r\nif he could.... I pressed the button. (I had no right to do that,\r\nbut who cared about rights then?) The curtains fell.\r\n\r\nEvidently she felt and understood what was coming for she rushed to\r\nthe door. But I was quicker than she and I locked the door with the\r\nkey, breathing loudly and not taking my eyes for a second away from\r\nthat place on her head....\r\n\r\n\"You ... you are mad! How dare you....\" She moved backward towards\r\nthe bed, put her trembling hands between her knees.... Like a tense\r\nspring, holding her firmly with my gaze, I slowly stretched out my\r\narm towards the table (only one arm could move), and I snatched the\r\npiston.\r\n\r\n\"I implore you! One day--only one day! Tomorrow I shall go and\r\nattend to the formalities....\"\r\n\r\nWhat was she talking about? I swung my arm.... And I consider I\r\nkilled her. Yes, you my unknown readers, you have the right to call\r\nme murderer. I know that I should have dealt the blow on her head\r\nhad she not screamed:\r\n\r\n\"For ... for the sake ... I agree.... I ... one moment....\" With\r\ntrembling hands she tore off her unif;--a large, yellow, drooping\r\nbody, she fell upon the bed....\r\n\r\nThen I understood; she thought that I pulled the curtains ... in\r\norder to ... that I wanted....\r\n\r\nThis was so unexpected and so stupid that I burst out laughing.\r\nImmediately the tense spring within me broke and my hand weakened\r\nand the piston fell to the floor.\r\n\r\nHere I learned from personal experience that laughter is the most\r\nterrible of weapons; you can kill anything with laughter, even\r\nmurder. I sat at my table and laughed desperately; I saw no way out\r\nof that absurd situation. I don't know what would have been the end\r\nif things had run their natural course, for suddenly a new factor in\r\nthe arithmetical chain: the telephone rang.\r\n\r\nI hurried, grasped the receiver. Perhaps she ... I heard an\r\nunfamiliar voice:\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nAnnoying, infinite buzzing. Heavy steps from afar, nearer and louder\r\nlike cast-iron, and....\r\n\r\n\"D-503? The Well-Doer speaking. Come at once to me.\"\r\n\r\nDing! He hung up the receiver. Ding! like a key in a keyhole.\r\n\r\nU- was still in bed, eyes closed, gills apart in the form of a\r\nsmile. I picked up her clothes, threw them on her and said through\r\nclenched teeth:\r\n\r\n\"Well. Quick! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her body on her elbow, her breasts hanging down to one\r\nside, eyes round. She became a figure of wax.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get dressed, that is what!\"\r\n\r\nFace distorted, she firmly snatched her clothes and said in a flat\r\nvoice, \"Turn away....\"\r\n\r\nI turned away, pressed my forehead against the glass. Light,\r\nfigures, sparks, were trembling in the black, wet mirror.... No,\r\nall this was I, myself,--within me.... What did he call me for?\r\nIs it possible that he knows already about her, about me, about\r\neverything?\r\n\r\nU-, already dressed, was at the door. I made a step toward her and\r\npressed her hand as hard as though I hoped to squeeze out of it drop\r\nby drop what I needed.\r\n\r\n\"Listen.... Her name, you know whom I am talking of,--did you report\r\nher name? No? Tell the truth, I must.... I care not what happens,\r\nbut tell the truth!\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"No? But why not, since you....\"\r\n\r\nHer lower lip turned out like the lip of that boy and her face ...\r\ntears were running down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Because I ... I was afraid that if I did you might ... you would\r\nstop lov-- Oh, I cannot, I could not!\"\r\n\r\nI understood. It was the truth. Absurd, ridiculous, human truth. I\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-SIX\r\n\r\n  Empty Pages\r\n  The Christian God\r\n  About My Mother\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very strange that a kind of empty white page should be left\r\nin my head. How I walked there, how I waited (I remember I had to\r\nwait), I know nothing about it; I remember not a sound, not a face,\r\nnot a gesture, as if all communicating wires between me and the\r\nworld were cut.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to, I found myself standing before Him; I feared to\r\nraise my eyes,--I saw only His enormous cast-iron hands upon His\r\nknees. Those hands weighed upon Him, bending His knees with their\r\nweight. He was slowly moving His fingers. His face was somewhere\r\nabove as if in fog. And, only because His voice came to my ear from\r\nsuch a height, it did not roar like thunder, it did not deafen me\r\nbut appeared to be an ordinary human voice.\r\n\r\n\"Then you too, you the Builder of the _Integral_! You, whose lot\r\nit was to become the greatest of all _conquistadores_! You whose\r\nname was to have been at the head of a glorious, new chapter of the\r\nhistory of the United State! You....\"\r\n\r\nBlood ran to my head, to my cheeks,--and here again a white page;\r\nonly the pulsation in my temples and the heavy voice from above;\r\nbut I remember not a word. Only when He became silent I came to\r\nand noticed how His hand moved heavily like a thousand pounds, and\r\ncrawled slowly,--a finger threatened me.\r\n\r\n\"Well! Why are you silent? Is it true, or not? Executioner? So!\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" I repeated submissively. And then I clearly heard every word\r\nof His.\r\n\r\n\"Well then? Do you think I am afraid of the word! Did you ever try\r\nto take off its shell and look into its inner meaning? I shall tell\r\nyou.... Remember a blue hill, a crowd, a cross? Some up on the hill,\r\nsprinkled with blood, are busy nailing a body to the cross; others\r\nbelow, sprinkled with tears, are gazing upward. Does it not seem to\r\nyou that the part which those above must play is the more difficult,\r\nthe most important part? If it were not for them, how could that\r\nmagnificent tragedy ever have been staged? True, they were hissed\r\nby the dark crowd but for that the author of the tragedy, God,\r\nshould have remunerated them the more liberally, should he not?\r\nAnd the Christian, most clement God himself, who burnt on a slow\r\nfire all the infidels, is he not an executioner? Was the number\r\nof those burned by the Christians less than the number of burned\r\nChristians? Yet (you must understand this!), yet this God was for\r\ncenturies glorified as the God of love! Absurd? Oh, no. Just the\r\ncontrary. It is rather a patent for the imperishable wisdom of man,\r\nwritten in blood. Even at the time when he still was wild and hairy\r\nman knew that real, algebraic love for humanity must inevitably be\r\ninhuman, and that the inevitable mark of truth is cruelty, just as\r\nthe inevitable mark of fire is its property of causing the sensation\r\nof burning. Could you show me a fire that would not hurt? Well,\r\nprove now your point! Proceed! Argue!\"\r\n\r\nHow could I argue? How could I argue when those thoughts were once\r\nmine, though I was never able to dress them in such a splendid,\r\ntempered armor. I remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"If your silence is intended to mean that you agree with me, then\r\nlet us talk as adults do after the children have gone to bed; let\r\nus talk to the logical end. I ask: what was it that man from his\r\ndiaper age dreamed of, tormented himself for, prayed for? He longed\r\nfor that day when someone would tell him what happiness is and then\r\nwould chain him to it. What else are we doing now? The ancient\r\ndream about a paradise.... Remember: there in paradise they know no\r\ndesires any more, no pity, no love; there they are all--blessed. An\r\noperation has been performed upon their centre of fancy; that is why\r\nthey are blessed, angels, servants of God.... And now, at the very\r\nmoment when we have caught up with that dream, when we hold it like\r\nthis\": (He clenched his hand so, that if he had held a stone in it\r\nsap would have run out!) \"At the moment when all that was left for\r\nus was to adorn our prize and distribute it amongst all in equal\r\npieces, at that very moment you, you....\"\r\n\r\nThe cast-iron roar was suddenly broken off. I was as red as a piece\r\nof iron on an anvil, under the moulding sledge-hammer. This seemed\r\nto have stopped for a second, hanging in air, and I waited, waited\r\n... until suddenly:\r\n\r\n\"How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just double the age, and as simple as at sixteen! Listen. Is it\r\npossible that it really never occurred to you that _they_ (we do\r\nnot yet know their names but I am certain you will disclose them to\r\nus), that _they_ were interested in you only as the Builder of the\r\n_Integral?_ only in order to be able through the use of you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't! Don't!\" I cried. But it was like protecting yourself with\r\nyour hands and crying to a bullet: you may still be hearing your\r\nown \"don't\" but the bullet meanwhile has burned you through, and\r\nwrithing with pain, you are prostrated on the ground.\r\n\r\nYes, yes; the Builder of the _Integral_.... Yes, yes.... At once\r\nthere came back to me the angry face of U- with twitching, brick-red\r\ngills, on that morning when both of them....\r\n\r\nI remember now, clearly, how I raised my eyes and laughed. A\r\nSocrates-like, bald-headed man was sitting before me; and small\r\ndrops of sweat dotted the bald surface of his cranium.\r\n\r\nHow simple, how magnificently trivial everything was! How simple!\r\nAlmost to the point of being ridiculous. Laughter was choking me and\r\nbursting forth in puffs; I covered my mouth with my hand and rushed\r\nwildly out....\r\n\r\nSteps. Wind. Damp, leaping fragments of lights and faces.... And\r\nwhile running: \"No! Only to see her! To see her once more!\"\r\n\r\nHere again, an empty white page. All I remember is feet; not people,\r\njust feet; hundreds of feet, confusedly stamping feet, falling\r\nfrom somewhere on the pavement; a heavy rain of feet.... And some\r\ncheerful, daring voice, and a shout that was probably for me: \"Hey,\r\nhey! Come here! Come along with us!\"\r\n\r\nAfterward--a deserted square heavily overloaded with tense wind. In\r\nthe middle of the square a dim, heavy threatening mass--the Machine\r\nof the Well-Doer; and a seemingly unexpected image arose within me\r\nin response to the sight of the Machine: a snow-white pillow and on\r\nthe pillow a head thrown back, and half-closed eyes and a sharp,\r\nsweet line of teeth.... All this seemed so absurdly, so terribly\r\nconnected with the Machine. I know _how_ this connection has come\r\nabout but I do not yet want to see it nor to say it aloud--I don't\r\nwant to! I do not!\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes, sat down on the steps which lead upwards to\r\nthe Machine. I must have been running for my face was wet. From\r\nsomewhere very far away cries were coming. But nobody heard them;\r\nnobody heard me crying: \"Save me from it--save me!\"\r\n\r\nIf only I had a mother as the ancients had,--my mother, _mine_, for\r\nwhom I should be not the Builder of the _Integral_ and not D-530,\r\nnot a molecule of the United State but merely a living human piece,\r\na piece of herself, a trampled, smothered, a cast-off piece.... And\r\nthough I were driving the nails into the cross or being nailed to\r\nit (perhaps it is the same), she would hear what no one else could\r\nhear; her old grown-together wrinkled lips....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-SEVEN\r\n\r\n  Infusorian\r\n  Doomsday\r\n  Her Room\r\n\r\n\r\nThis morning while we were in the refectory, my neighbor to my left\r\nwhispered to me in a frightened tone:\r\n\r\n\"But why don't you eat? Don't you see, they are looking at you!\"\r\n\r\nI had to pluck up all my strength to show a smile. I felt it--like a\r\ncrack in my face; I smiled and the borders of the crack drew apart\r\nwider and wider; it was quite painful.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was this: no sooner had I lifted the small cube of\r\npaste upon my fork, than my fork jerked from my hand and tinkled\r\nagainst the plate, and at once the tables, the walls, the plates,\r\nthe air even, trembled and rang; and outside too, an enormous, iron,\r\nround roar reaching the sky--floating over heads and houses it died\r\naway in the distance in small, hardly perceptible circles like those\r\nupon water.\r\n\r\nI saw faces instantaneously grow faded and bleached; I saw mouths\r\nfilled with food suddenly motionless and forks hanging in air. Then\r\neverything became confused, jumped off the centuries-old tracks,\r\neverybody jumped up from his place (without singing the Hymn!)\r\nand confusedly, in disorder, hastily finishing chewing, choking,\r\ngrasping one another.... They were asking: \"What? What happened?\r\nWhat?...\" And the disorderly fragments of the Machine which was once\r\nperfect and great, fell down in all directions,--down the elevators,\r\ndown the stairs.... Stamping of feet.... Pieces of words like pieces\r\nof torn letters carried by the wind....\r\n\r\nThe same outpour from the neighboring houses. A minute later the\r\navenue seemed like a drop of water under a microscope: the infusoria\r\nlocked up in the transparent, glass-like drop of water were tossing\r\naround, to the sides, up and down.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" Some one's triumphant voice. I saw the back of a neck\r\nand a finger pointing to the sky. I remember very distinctly a\r\nyellow-pinkish nail and under the nail a crescent crawling out as if\r\nfrom under the horizon. The finger was like a compass; all eyes were\r\nraised to the sky.\r\n\r\nThere, running away from an invisible pursuit, masses of cloud\r\nwere rushing upon each other; and colored by the clouds the aeros\r\nof the Guardians, with their tubes like antennae, were floating.\r\nAnd farther to the west--something like.... At first nobody could\r\nunderstand what it was, even I, who knew (unfortunately) more\r\nthan the others. It was like a great hive of black aeros swarming\r\nsomewhere at an extraordinary height--they looked like hardly\r\nnoticeable, swiftly moving points.... Nearer and nearer.... Hoarse,\r\nguttural sounds began to reach the earth and finally we saw _birds_\r\njust over our heads! They filled the sky with their sharp, black,\r\ndescending triangles. The stormy wind drove them down and they began\r\nto land on the cupolas, on the roofs, poles and balconies.\r\n\r\n\"Ah--ah!\" and the triumphant back of the neck turned, and I saw that\r\nman with the protruding forehead but it seemed that the title, so\r\nto speak, was all that was left of him: he seemed to have crawled\r\nout from under his forehead and on his face, around the eyes and\r\nlips, bunches of rays were growing. Through the noise of the wind\r\nand wings and cawing, he cried to me:\r\n\r\n\"Do you realize? Do you realize! They have blown up the Wall! The\r\nWall has been blown up! Do you _understand_?\"\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the background, figures with their heads drawn in\r\nwere hastily rushing by, and into the houses. In the middle of the\r\npavement a mass of those who had been already operated upon; they\r\nmoved towards the west....\r\n\r\n... Hairy bunches of rays around the lips and eyes.... I grasped his\r\nhands:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me. Where is she? Where is I-330? There? Beyond the Wall\r\nor...? I must.... Do you hear me? At once.... I cannot....\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" he shouted in a happy, drunken voice, showing strong yellow\r\nteeth, \"here in town, and she is acting! Oh, we are doing great\r\nwork!\"\r\n\r\nWho are those \"we\"? Who am I?\r\n\r\nThere were about fifty around him. Like him, they seemed to have\r\ncrawled out from under their foreheads. They were loud, cheerful,\r\nstrong-toothed, swallowing the stormy wind. With their simple, not\r\nat all terrible-looking electrocutors (where did they get them?)\r\nthey started to the west, towards the operated ones, encircling\r\nthem, keeping parallel to forty-eighth avenue....\r\n\r\nStumbling against the tightly-drawn ropes woven by the wind, I\r\nwas running to her. What for? I did not know. I was stumbling....\r\nEmpty streets.... The city seemed foreign, wild, filled with the\r\nceaseless, triumphant, hubbub of birds. It seemed like the end of\r\nthe world, _Doomsday_.\r\n\r\nThrough the glass of the walls in quite a few houses (this\r\ncut into my mind) I saw male and female Numbers in shameless\r\nembraces--without curtains lowered, without pink checks, in the\r\nmiddle of the day!...\r\n\r\nThe house--her house; the door ajar. The lobby, the control desk,\r\nall was empty. The elevator had stopped in the middle of its shaft.\r\nI ran panting up the endless stairs. The corridor. Like the spokes\r\nof a wheel figures on the doors dashed past my eyes; 320, 326,\r\n330,--I-330! Through the glass wall everything in her room was seen\r\nto be upside down, confused, creased. The table overturned, its legs\r\nin the air like a beast. The bed was absurdly placed away from the\r\nwall, obliquely. Strewn over the floor--fallen, trodden petals of\r\nthe pink checks.\r\n\r\nI bent over and picked up one, two, three of them; all bore the\r\nname D-503. I was on all of them, drops of myself, of my molten,\r\npoured-out self. And that was all--that was left....\r\n\r\nSomehow I felt they should not lie there on the floor and be trodden\r\nupon. I gathered a handful of them, put them on the table and\r\ncarefully smoothed them out, glanced at them and ... laughed aloud!\r\nI never knew it before but now I know, and you too, know, that\r\nlaughter may be of different colors. It is but a distant echo of an\r\nexplosion within us; it may be the echo of a holiday, red, blue and\r\ngolden fireworks, or at times it may represent pieces of human flesh\r\nexploded into the air....\r\n\r\nI noticed an unfamiliar name on some of the pink checks. I do not\r\nremember the figures but I do remember the letter--F. I brushed\r\nthe stubs from the table to the floor, stepped on them, on myself,\r\nstamped on them with my heels,--and went out....\r\n\r\nI sat in the corridor on the window-sill in front of her door and\r\nwaited long and stupidly. An old man appeared. His face was like\r\na pierced, empty bladder with folds; from beneath the puncture\r\nsomething transparent was still slowly dripping. Slowly, vaguely I\r\nrealized--tears. And only when the old man was quite far off I came\r\nto and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Please ... listen.... Do you know ... Number I-330?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man turned around, waved his hand in despair and stumbled\r\nfarther away....\r\n\r\nI returned home at dusk. On the west side the sky was twitching\r\nevery second in a pale blue electric convulsion:--a subdued, heavy\r\nroar was proceeding from that direction. The roofs were covered with\r\nblack charred sticks,--birds.\r\n\r\nI lay down; and instantly like a heavy beast sleep came and stifled\r\nme....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-EIGHT\r\n\r\nI Don't Know What Title--Perhaps the Whole Synopsis May Be Called\r\na Cast-off Cigarette-butt.\r\n\r\n\r\nI awoke. A bright glare painful to look at. I half closed my eyes.\r\nMy head seemed filled with some caustic blue smoke. Everything was\r\nenveloped in fog and through the fog:\r\n\r\n\"But I did not turn on the light ... then how is it....\"\r\n\r\nI jumped up. At the table, leaning her chin on her hand and smiling,\r\nwas I-330, looking at me.\r\n\r\nShe was at the very table at which I am now writing. Those ten or\r\nfifteen minutes are already behind me, cruelly twisted into a very\r\nfirm spring. Yet it seems to me that the door closed after her only\r\na second ago and that I could still overtake her and grasp her\r\nhand,--and that she might laugh out and say....\r\n\r\nI-330 was at the table. I rushed towards her.\r\n\r\n\"You? You! I have been.... I saw your room.... I thought you....\"\r\nBut midway I hurt myself upon the sharp, motionless spears of her\r\neyelashes and I stopped. I remembered: she looked at me in the same\r\nway before,--in the _Integral_. It was urgent to tell her everything\r\nin one second and in such a way that she should believe--or she\r\nwould never....\r\n\r\n\"Listen, I-330, I must.... I must ... everything! No, no, one\r\nmoment--let me have a glass of water first.\"\r\n\r\nMy mouth was as dry as though it were lined with blotting paper. I\r\npoured a glass of water but I could not.... I put the glass back\r\nupon the table, and with both hands firmly grasped the carafe.\r\n\r\nNow I noticed that the blue smoke was from a cigarette. She brought\r\nthe cigarette to her lips and with avidity she drew in and swallowed\r\nthe smoke as I did water; then she said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't. Be silent. Don't you see it matters little? I came anyway.\r\nThey are waiting for me below.... Do you want these minutes which\r\nare our last...?\"\r\n\r\nAbruptly she threw the cigarette on the floor and bent backwards\r\nover the side of the chair to reach the button in the wall (it was\r\nquite difficult to do so), and I remember how the chair swayed\r\nslightly, how two of its legs were lifted. Then the curtains fell.\r\n\r\nShe came close to me and embraced me. Her knees, through her dress,\r\nwere like a slow, gentle, warm, enveloping and permeating poison....\r\n\r\nSuddenly (it happens at times) you plunge into sweet, warm\r\nsleep--when all at once, as if something pricks you, you tremble and\r\nyour eyes are again widely open. So it was now; there on the floor\r\nin her room were the pink checks stamped with traces of footsteps,\r\none of them bore the letter F. and some figures.... Plus and minus\r\nfused within my mind into one lump.... I could not say even now what\r\nsort of a feeling it was but I crushed her so that she cried out\r\nwith pain....\r\n\r\nOne more minute out of these ten or fifteen; her head thrown back,\r\nlying on the bright white pillow, her eyes half closed, a sharp,\r\nsweet line of teeth.... And all this reminded me in an irresistible,\r\nabsurd, torturing way about something forbidden, something not\r\npermissible at that moment. More tenderly, more cruelly, I pressed\r\nher to myself, more bright grew the blue traces of my fingers....\r\n\r\nShe said, without opening her eyes (I noticed this), \"They say you\r\nwent to see the Well-Doer yesterday, is it true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThen her eyes opened widely and with delight I looked at her and saw\r\nthat her face grew quickly paler and paler, that it effaced itself,\r\ndisappearing,--only the eyes remained.\r\n\r\nI told her everything. Only for some reason, what I don't know--(no,\r\nit is not true, I know the reason) I was silent about one thing: His\r\nassertion at the end that they needed me only in order....\r\n\r\nLike the image on a photographic plate in a developing fluid, her\r\nface gradually reappeared; the cheeks, the white line of teeth, the\r\nlips. She stood up and went to the mirror-door of the closet. My\r\nmouth was dry again. I poured water but it was revolting to drink\r\nit; I put the glass back on the table and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did you come to see me because you wanted to inquire...?\"\r\n\r\nA sharp, mocking triangle of brows drawn to the temples looked at\r\nme from the mirror. She turned around to say something but said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary; I knew.\r\n\r\nTo bid her good-bye, I moved my foreign limbs, struck the chair with\r\nthem. It fell upside down, dead, like the table in her room. Her\r\nlips were cold ... just as cold was once the floor, here, near my\r\nbed....\r\n\r\nWhen she left I sat down on the floor, bent over the\r\ncigarette-butt....\r\n\r\nI cannot write any more--I no longer want to!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD THIRTY-NINE\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this was like the last crystal of salt thrown into a saturated\r\nsolution; quickly, needle-like crystals began to appear, to grow\r\nmore substantial and solid. It was clear to me; the decision was\r\nmade and tomorrow morning _I shall do it_! It amounts to suicide\r\nbut perhaps then I shall be re-born. For only what is killed can be\r\nre-born.\r\n\r\nEvery second the sky twitched in convulsion there in the west. My\r\nhead was burning and pulsating inside; I was up all night and I fell\r\nasleep only at about seven o'clock in the morning when the darkness\r\nof the night was already dispelled and becoming gray and when the\r\nroofs crowded with birds became visible....\r\n\r\nI woke up; ten o'clock. Evidently the bell did not ring today. On\r\nthe table--left from yesterday--there stood the glass of water.\r\nI gulped the water down with avidity and I ran; I had to do it\r\nquickly, as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe sky was deserted, blue, all eaten up by the storm. Sharp corners\r\nof shadows.... Everything seemed to be cut out of blue autumnal\r\nair--thin, dangerous to touch; it seemed so brittle, ready to\r\ndisperse into glass dust. Within me something similar; I ought not\r\nto think; it was dangerous to think, for....\r\n\r\nAnd I did not think, perhaps I did not even see properly; I\r\nonly registered impressions. There on the pavement, thrown from\r\nsomewhere, branches were strewn; their leaves were green, amber and\r\ncherry-red. Above, crossing each other, birds and aeros were tossing\r\nabout. Here below heads, open mouths, hands waving branches.... All\r\nthis must have been shouting, buzzing, chirping....\r\n\r\nThen--streets empty as if swept by a plague. I remember I stumbled\r\nover something disgustingly soft, yielding yet motionless. I bent\r\ndown--a corpse. It was lying flat, the legs apart. The face.... I\r\nrecognized the thick negro lips which even now seemed to sprinkle\r\nwith laughter. His eyes, firmly screwed in, laughed into my face.\r\nOne second.... I stepped over him and ran. I could no longer.... I\r\nhad to have everything done as soon as possible, or else I felt I\r\nwould break, I would break in two like an overloaded sail....\r\n\r\nLuckily it was not more than twenty steps away; I already saw the\r\nsign with the golden letters: \"The Bureau of Guardians.\" At the\r\ndoor I stopped for a moment to gulp down as much air as I could and\r\nstepped in.\r\n\r\nInside, in the corridor stood an endless chain of numbers, holding\r\nsmall sheets of paper and heavy note-books. They moved slowly,\r\nadvancing a step or two and stopping again. I began to be tossed\r\nabout along the chain, my head was breaking to pieces; I pulled\r\nthem by the sleeves, I implored them as a sick man implores to be\r\ngiven something that would even at the price of sharpest pain end\r\neverything, forever.\r\n\r\nA woman with a belt tightly clasped around her waist over the unif\r\nand with two distinctly protruding squatty hemispheres tossing about\r\nas if she had eyes on them, chuckled at me:\r\n\r\n\"He has a belly-ache! Show him to the room second door to the\r\nright!\"\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed, and because of that laughter something rose in my\r\nthroat; I felt I should either scream or ... or....\r\n\r\nSuddenly from behind some one touched my elbow. I turned around.\r\nTransparent wing-ears! But they were not pink as usual; they were\r\npurplish red; his Adam's apple was tossing about as though ready to\r\ntear the covering....\r\n\r\nQuickly boring into me: \"What are you here for?\"\r\n\r\nI seized him.\r\n\r\n\"Quickly! Please! Quickly! ... into your office.... I must tell\r\neverything ... right away.... I am glad that you.... It may be\r\nterrible that it should be you to whom.... But it is well, it is\r\nwell....\"\r\n\r\nHe too, knew _her_; this made it even more tormenting for me. But\r\nperhaps he too, would tremble when he should hear.... And we would\r\nboth be killing.... And I would not be alone at that, my supreme\r\nsecond....\r\n\r\nThe door closed with a slam. I remember a piece of paper was\r\ncaught beneath the door and it rustled on the floor when the\r\ndoor closed. And then a strange airless silence covered us as if\r\na glass bell were put over us. If only he had uttered a single,\r\nmost insignificant word, no matter what, I should have told him\r\neverything at once. But he was silent. So keyed up that I heard a\r\nnoise in my ears, I said without looking at him:\r\n\r\n\"I think I always hated her from the very beginning.... I\r\nstruggled.... Or, no, no, don't believe me; I could have but I did\r\nnot want to save myself; I wanted to perish; this was dearer to\r\nme than anything else ... and even now, even this minute, when I\r\nknow already everything.... Do you know that I was summoned to the\r\nWell-Doer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what he told me! Please realize that it was equivalent to ...\r\nit was as if some one should remove the floor from under you this\r\nminute, and you and all here on the desk, the papers, the ink ...\r\nthe ink would splash out and cover everything with blots....\"\r\n\r\n\"What else? What further? Hurry up, others are waiting!\"\r\n\r\nThen stumbling, muttering, I told him everything that is recorded\r\nin these pages.... About my real self, and about my hairy self, and\r\nabout my hands ... yes ... exactly that was the beginning. And\r\nhow I would not do my duty then, and how I lied to myself, and how\r\nshe obtained false certificates for me, and how I grew worse and\r\nworse, every day, and about the long corridors underground, and\r\nthere beyond the Wall....\r\n\r\nAll this I threw out in formless pieces and lumps. I would stutter\r\nand fail to find words. The lips double-curved in a smile would\r\nprompt me with the word I needed and I would nod gratefully: \"Yes,\r\nyes!\".... Suddenly, what was it? He was talking for me and I only\r\nlistened and nodded: \"Yes, yes,\" and then, \"Yes, exactly so, ...\r\nyes, yes....\"\r\n\r\nI felt cold around my mouth as though it were wet with ether, and I\r\nasked with difficulty:\r\n\r\n\"But how is it.... You could not learn anywhere....\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled a smile growing more and more curved; then:\r\n\r\n\"But I see that you do want to conceal from me something. For\r\nexample, you enumerated everything you saw beyond the Wall but you\r\nfailed to mention one thing. You deny it? But don't you remember\r\nthat once, just in passing, just for a second you saw me there? Yes,\r\nyes _me_!\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, like a flash of lightning, it became shamelessly clear to\r\nme: he--he too--. And all myself, my torment, all that I brought\r\nhere, crushed by the burden, plucking up my last strength as if\r\nperforming a great feat, all appeared to me only funny,--like the\r\nancient anecdote about Abraham and Isaac; Abraham all in a cold\r\nsweat, with the knife already raised over his son, over himself--and\r\nsuddenly a voice from above: \"Never mind.... I was only joking.\"\r\n\r\nWithout taking my eyes from the smile which grew more and more\r\ncurved, I put my hands on the edge of the desk and slowly, very\r\nslowly pushed myself with my chair away from him. Then instantly\r\ngathering myself into my own hands, I dashed madly out, past loud\r\nvoices, past steps and mouths....\r\n\r\nI do not remember how I got into one of the public rest-rooms at a\r\nstation of the Underground Railway. Above, everything was perishing;\r\nthe greatest civilization, the most rational in human history was\r\ncrumbling,--but here, by some irony everything remained as before,\r\nbeautiful. The walls shone; water murmured cosily and like the\r\nwater,--the unseen, transparent music.... Only think of it! All this\r\nis doomed; all this will be covered with grass, some day; only myths\r\nwill remain....\r\n\r\nI moaned aloud. At the same instant I felt someone gently patting\r\nmy knee. It was from the left; it was my neighbor who occupied a\r\nseat on my left,--an enormous forehead, a bald parabola, yellow\r\nunintelligible lines of wrinkles on his forehead, those lines about\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you. I understand completely,\" he said. \"Yet you must\r\ncalm yourself. You must. It will return. It will inevitably return.\r\nIt is only important that everybody should learn of my discovery.\r\nYou are the first to whom I talk about it. I have calculated that\r\nthere is no _infinity_! No!\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him wildly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I tell you so. There is no infinity. If the universe is\r\ninfinite, then the average density of matter must equal zero, but\r\nas it is not zero, we know, consequently the universe is finite; it\r\nis spherical in form and the square of its radius--R2--is equal\r\nto the average density multiplied by.... The only thing left is to\r\ncalculate the numerical coefficient and then.... Do you realize\r\nwhat it means? It means that everything is final, everything is\r\nsimple.... But you, my honored sir, you disturb me, you prevent my\r\nfinishing my calculations by your yelling!\"\r\n\r\nI do not know which shattered me more, his discovery, or his\r\npositiveness at that apocalyptic hour. I only then noticed that he\r\nhad a notebook in his hands and a logarithmic dial. I understood\r\nthen that even if everything was perishing it was my duty (before\r\nyou, my unknown and beloved) to leave these records in a finished\r\nform.\r\n\r\nI asked him to give me some paper, and here in the rest-room to the\r\naccompaniment of the quiet music, transparent like water, I wrote\r\ndown these last lines.\r\n\r\nI was about to put down a period as the ancients would put a cross\r\nover the caves into which they used to throw their dead, when all of\r\na sudden my pencil trembled and fell from between my fingers....\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" (I pulled my neighbor). \"Yes, listen, I say. There where\r\nyour finite universe ends, what is there? What?\"\r\n\r\nHe had no time to answer. From above, down the steps, stamping....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD FORTY\r\n\r\n  Facts\r\n  The Bell\r\n  I Am Certain\r\n\r\n\r\nDaylight. It is clear. The barometer--760 mm. It is possible that I,\r\nD-503, really wrote these--pages? Is it possible that I ever felt,\r\nor imagined I felt all this?\r\n\r\nThe handwriting is mine. And what follows is all in my handwriting.\r\nFortunately only the handwriting. No more delirium, no absurd\r\nmetaphors, no feelings,--only facts. For I am healthy, perfectly,\r\nabsolutely healthy.... I am smiling; I cannot help smiling; a\r\nsplinter has been taken out of my head and I feel so light, so\r\nempty! To be more exact, not empty, but there is nothing foreign,\r\nnothing that prevents me from smiling. (Smiling is the normal state\r\nfor a normal human being).\r\n\r\nThe facts are as follows: That evening my neighbor who discovered\r\nthe finiteness of the universe, and I, and all others who did not\r\nhave a certificate showing that we had been operated on, all of us\r\nwere taken to the nearest auditorium. (For some reason the number\r\nof the auditorium, 112, seemed familiar to me). There they tied\r\nus to the tables and performed the great operation. Next day, I,\r\nD-503, appeared before the Well-Doer and told him everything known\r\nto me about the enemies of happiness. Why before it seemed hard for\r\nme to go, I cannot understand. The only explanation seems to be my\r\nillness,--my soul.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, sitting at the same table with Him, with the\r\nWell-Doer, I saw for the first time in my life the famous Gas\r\nChamber. They brought in that woman. She was to testify in my\r\npresence. That woman remained stubbornly silent and smiling. I\r\nnoticed that she had sharp and very white teeth which were very\r\npretty.\r\n\r\nThen she was brought under the Bell. Her face became very white\r\nand as her eyes were large and dark,--all was very pretty. When\r\nthey began pumping the air from under the Bell she threw her head\r\nback and half closed her eyes; her lips were pressed together. This\r\nreminded me of something. She looked at me, holding the arms of the\r\nchair firmly. She continued to look until her eyes closed. Then she\r\nwas taken out and brought to by means of electrodes and again put\r\nunder the Bell. The procedure was repeated three times, yet she did\r\nnot utter a word.\r\n\r\nThe others who were brought in with that woman, proved to be more\r\nhonest; many of them began to speak after the first trial. Tomorrow\r\nthey will all ascend the steps to the Machine of the Well-Doer.\r\nNo postponement is possible for there still is chaos, groaning,\r\ncadavers, beasts in the western section, and to our regret there\r\nare still quantities of Numbers who betrayed Reason.\r\n\r\nBut on the transverse avenue Forty, we succeeded in establishing a\r\ntemporary Wall of high voltage waves. And I hope we win. More than\r\nthat; I am certain we shall win. For Reason must win.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nMany hyphenation inconsistencies have been regularized.
