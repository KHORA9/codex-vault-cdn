It came almost immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Cadet Corbett ready for testing,\" a voice crackled thinly over the\r\nloud-speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Proceed.\"\r\n\r\nSeated in front of the scanner screen on the control deck of the rocket\r\ncruiser _Polaris_, Captain Steve Strong replaced the microphone in its\r\nslot and watched a bulky figure in a space suit step out of the air lock\r\nand drift away from the side of the ship. Behind him, five boys, all\r\ndressed in the vivid blue uniforms of the Space Cadet Corps, strained\r\nforward to watch the lone figure adjust the nozzles of the jet unit on\r\nthe back of his space suit.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Tom!\" said the biggest of the five boys, his voice a low,\r\npowerful rumble as he rooted for his unit mate.\r\n\r\n\"If Tom makes this one,\" crowed the cadet next to him, a slender boy\r\nwith a thick shock of close-cropped blond hair, \"the _Polaris_ unit is\r\nhome free!\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the last test, Manning,\" replied one of the remaining three\r\ncadets, the insigne of the _Arcturus_ unit on the sleeve of his uniform.\r\n\"_If_ Corbett makes this one, you fellows deserve to win.\"\r\n\r\nAboard the rocket cruiser _Polaris_, blasting through the black void of\r\nspace two hundred miles above Earth, six Space Cadets and a Solar Guard\r\nofficer were conducting the final test for unit honors for the term. All\r\nother Academy units had been eliminated in open competition. Now, the\r\nresults of the individual space orientation test would decide whether\r\nthe three cadets of the _Arcturus_ unit or the three cadets of the\r\n_Polaris_ unit would win final top unit honors.\r\n\r\nRoger Manning and Astro kept their eyes glued to the telescanner screen,\r\nwatching their unit mate, Tom Corbett, drift slowly through space toward\r\nhis starting position. The young cadet's task was basically simple; with\r\nhis space helmet blacked out so that he could not see in any direction,\r\nhe was to make his way back to the ship from a point a mile away, guided\r\nonly by the audio orders from the examining officer aboard the ship. His\r\nscore was measured by the time elapsed, and the amount of corrections\r\nand orders given by the examining officer. It was an exercise designed\r\nto test a cadet's steadiness under emergency conditions of space.\r\n\r\nThe three members of the _Arcturus_ unit had completed their runs and\r\nhad returned to the ship in excellent time. Roger and Astro had also\r\ntaken their tests and now it depended on Tom. If he could return to the\r\n_Polaris_ in less than ten minutes, with no more than three corrections,\r\nthe _Polaris_ unit would be victorious.\r\n\r\nSeated directly in front of the scanner, Captain Steve Strong, the\r\nexamining officer, watched the space-suited figure dwindle to a mere\r\nspeck on the screen. As the regular skipper of the _Polaris_ crew, he\r\ncould not help secretly rooting for Tom, but he was determined to be\r\nfair, even to the extent of declaring the _Arcturus_ unit the winner,\r\nshould the decision be very close. He leaned forward to adjust the focus\r\non the scanner, bringing the drifting figure into a close-up view, and\r\nthen lifted the microphone to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by, Corbett!\" he called. \"You're getting close to range.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Tom. \"Standing by.\"\r\n\r\nBehind Strong, Roger and Astro looked at each other and turned back to\r\nthe screen. As one, they crossed the fingers of both hands.\r\n\r\n\"Ready, Corbett!\" called Strong. \"You'll be clocked from the second\r\nyou're on range. One hundred feet--seventy-five--fifty--twenty-five\r\n--ten--_time_!\"\r\n\r\nAs the signal echoed in his blacked-out space helmet, Tom jerked his\r\nbody around in a sudden violent move, and grasping the valve of the jet\r\nunit on his back, he opened it halfway. He waited, holding his breath,\r\nexpecting to hear Captain Strong correct his course. He counted to ten\r\nslowly, and when no correction came over the headphones, he opened the\r\nvalve wide and blindly shot through space.\r\n\r\nAboard the Polaris, Astro and Roger shouted with joy and Strong could\r\nnot repress a grin. The tiny figure on the scanner was hurtling straight\r\nfor the side of the _Polaris_!\r\n\r\nAs the image grew larger and larger, anxious eyes swiveled back and\r\nforth from the scanner screen to the steady sweeping hand of the\r\nchronometer. Roger bit his lip nervously, and Astro's hands trembled.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom reached a point five hundred feet away from the ship, Strong\r\nflipped open the audio circuit and issued his first order.\r\n\r\n\"Range five hundred feet,\" he called. \"Cut jets!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're already here, spaceboy!\" yelled Roger into the mike, leaning\r\nover Strong's shoulder. The captain silenced him with a glare. No one\r\ncould speak to the examinee but the testing officer.\r\n\r\nTom closed the valve of his jet unit and blindly jerked himself around\r\nagain to drift feet first toward the ship. Strong watched this approach\r\nclosely, silently admiring the effortless way the cadet handled himself\r\nin weightless space. When Tom was fifty feet away from the ship, and\r\nstill traveling quite fast, Strong gave the second order to break his\r\nspeed. Tom opened the valve again and felt the tug of the jets braking\r\nhis acceleration. He drifted slower and slower, and realizing that he\r\nwas close to the hull of the ship, he stretched his legs, striving to\r\nmake contact. Seconds later he felt a heavy thump at the soles of his\r\nfeet, and within the ship there was the muffled clank of metal boot\r\nweights hitting the metal skin of the hull.\r\n\r\n\"_Time!_\" roared Strong and glanced at the astral chronometer over his\r\nhead. The boys crowded around as the Solar Guard captain quickly\r\ncomputed Tom's score. \"Nine minutes, fifty-one seconds, and two\r\ncorrections,\" he announced, unable to keep the pride out of his voice.\r\n\r\n\"We win! We win!\" roared Roger. \"Term honors go to the _Polaris_!\"\r\n\r\nRoger turned around and began pounding Astro on the chest, and the giant\r\nVenusian picked him up and waltzed him around the deck. The three\r\nmembers of the _Arcturus_ unit waited until the first flush of victory\r\ndied away and then crowded around the two boys to congratulate them.\r\n\r\n\"Don't forget the cadet who did it,\" commented Strong dryly, and the\r\nfive cadets rushed below to the jet-boat deck to wait for Tom.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom emerged from the air lock a few moments later, Roger and Astro\r\nswarmed all over him, and another wild dance began. Finally, shaking\r\nfree of his well-meaning but violent unit mates, he grinned and gasped,\r\n\"Well, from that reception, I guess I did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spaceboy\"--Roger smiled--\"you made the _Arcturus_ unit look like three\r\nold men in a washtub counting toes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations, Corbett,\" said Tony Richards of the _Arcturus_ crew,\r\noffering his hand. \"That was really fast maneuvering out there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Tony.\" Tom grinned, running his hand through his brown curly\r\nhair. \"But I have to admit I was a little scared. Wow! What a creepy\r\nfeeling to know you're out in space alone and not able to see anything.\"\r\n\r\nTheir excitement was interrupted by Strong's voice over the ship's\r\nintercom. \"Stand by, all stations!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here we go!\" shouted Roger. \"Back to the Academy--and leave!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Yeeeeooooow!_\" Astro's bull-like roar echoed through the ship as the\r\ncadets hurried to their flight stations.\r\n\r\nAs command cadet of the _Polaris_, Tom climbed up to the control deck,\r\nand strapping himself into the command pilot's seat, prepared to get\r\nunder way. Astro, the power-deck cadet who could \"take apart a rocket\r\nengine and put it back together again with his thumbs,\" thundered below\r\nto the atomic rockets he loved more than anything else in the universe.\r\nRoger Manning, the third member of the famed _Polaris_ unit, raced up\r\nthe narrow ladder leading to the radar bridge to take command of\r\nastrogation and communications.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Strong and the members of the _Arcturus_ unit strapped\r\nthemselves into acceleration cushions, Tom conducted a routine check of\r\nthe many gauges on the great control panel before him. Satisfied, he\r\nflipped open the intercom and called, \"All stations, check in!\"\r\n\r\n\"Radar deck, aye!\" drawled Roger's lazy voice.\r\n\r\n\"Power deck, aye!\" rumbled Astro.\r\n\r\n\"Energize the cooling pumps!\" ordered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Cooling pumps, aye!\"\r\n\r\nThe whine of the mighty pumps was suddenly heard, moaning eerily\r\nthroughout the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Feed reactant!\"\r\n\r\nThe sharp hiss of fuel being forced into the rocket engines rose above\r\nthe whine of the pumps, and the ship trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by to blast,\" called Tom. \"Standard space speed!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the _Polaris_ shot toward Earth in a long, curving arc.\r\nMoments later, when the huge round ball of the mother planet loomed\r\nlarge on the scanner screen, Roger's voice reported over the intercom,\r\n\"Academy spaceport control gives us approach orbit 074 for touchdown on\r\nRamp Twelve, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"074 Ramp Twelve,\" repeated Tom. \"Got it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelve!\" roared Astro suddenly over the intercom. \"Couldn't you make it\r\ncloser to the Academy than that, Manning? We'll have to walk two miles\r\nto the nearest slidewalk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad, Astro,\" retorted Roger, \"but I guess if I had to carry around\r\nas much useless muscle and bone as you do, I'd complain too!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm just not as lucky as you, Manning,\" snapped Astro quickly. \"I don't\r\nhave all that space gas to float me around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knock it off, fellows,\" interjected Tom firmly. \"We're going into our\r\napproach.\"\r\n\r\nLying on his acceleration cushion, Strong looked over at Tony Richards\r\nof the _Arcturus_ unit and winked. Richards winked and smiled back.\r\n\"They never stop, do they, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"When they do,\" replied Strong, \"I'll send all three of them to sick bay\r\nfor examination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred thousand feet to Earth's surface,\" called Tom. \"Stand by\r\nfor landing operations.\"\r\n\r\nAs Tom adjusted the many controls on the complicated operations panel of\r\nthe ship, Roger and Astro followed his orders quickly and exactly. \"Cut\r\nmain drive rockets and give me one-half thrust on forward braking\r\nrockets!\" ordered Tom, his eyes glued to the altimeter.\r\n\r\nThe _Polaris_ shuddered under the sudden reverse in power, then began an\r\nupward curve, nose pointing back toward space. Tom barked another\r\ncommand. \"Braking rockets full! Stand by main drive rockets!\"\r\n\r\nThe sleek ship began to settle tailfirst toward its destination--Space\r\nAcademy, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of a great expanse of cleared land in the western part of\r\nthe North American continent, the cluster of buildings that marked Space\r\nAcademy gleamed brightly in the noon sun. Towering over the green grassy\r\nquadrangle of the Academy was the magnificent Tower of Galileo, built of\r\npure Titan crystal which gleamed like a gigantic diamond. With smaller\r\nbuildings, including the study halls, the nucleonics laboratory, the\r\ncadet dormitories, mess halls, recreation halls, all connected by\r\nrolling slidewalks--and to the north, the vast area of the spaceport\r\nwith its blast-pitted ramps--the Academy was the goal of every boy in\r\nthe year A.D. 2353, the age of the conquest of space.\r\n\r\nFounded over a hundred years before, Space Academy trained the youth of\r\nthe Solar Alliance for service in the Solar Guard, the powerful force\r\ncreated to protect the liberties of the planets. But from the beginning,\r\nAcademy standards were so high, requirements so strict, that not many\r\nmade it. Of the one thousand boys enrolled every year, it was expected\r\nthat only twenty-one of them would become officers, and of this group,\r\nonly seven would be command pilots. The great Solar Guard fleet that\r\npatrolled the space lanes across the millions of miles between the\r\nsatellites and planets possessed the finest, yet most complicated,\r\nequipment in the Alliance. To be an officer in the fleet required a\r\ncombination of skills and technical knowledge so demanding that eighty\r\nper cent of the Solar Guard officers retired at the age of forty.\r\n\r\nHigh over the spaceport, the three cadets of the _Polaris_ unit, happy\r\nover the prospect of a full month of freedom, concentrated on the task\r\nof landing the great ship on the Academy spaceport. Watching the\r\nteleceiver screen that gave him a view of the spaceport astern of the\r\nship, Tom called into the intercom, \"One thousand feet to touchdown. Cut\r\nbraking rockets. Main drive full!\"\r\n\r\nThe thunderous blast of the rockets was his answer, building up into\r\nroaring violence. Shuddering, the great cruiser eased to the ground foot\r\nby foot, perfectly balanced on the fiery exhaust from her main tubes.\r\n\r\nSeconds later the giant shock absorbers crunched on the ramp and Tom\r\nclosed the master switch cutting all power. He glanced at the astral\r\nchronometer over his head and then turned to speak into the audio log\r\nrecorder. \"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ completed space flight one-seven-six\r\nat 1301.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Strong stepped up to Tom and clapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\"Secure the _Polaris_, Tom, and tell Astro to get the reactant pile from\r\nthe firing chamber ready for dumping when the hot-soup wagon gets here.\"\r\nThe Solar Guard officer referred to the lead-lined jet sled that removed\r\nthe reactant piles from all ships that were to be laid up for longer\r\nthan three days. \"And you'd better get over to your dorm right away,\"\r\nStrong continued. \"You have to get ready for parade and full Corps\r\ndismissal.\"\r\n\r\nTom grinned. \"Yes, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're blasting off, sir,\" said Tony Richards, stepping forward with his\r\nunit mates. \"Congratulations again, Corbett. I still can't figure out\r\nhow you did it so quickly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Tony,\" replied Tom graciously. \"It was luck and the pressure of\r\ngood competition.\"\r\n\r\nRichards shook hands and then turned to Strong. \"Do I have your\r\npermission to leave the ship, sir?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Permission granted,\" replied Strong. \"And have a good leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe three _Arcturus_ cadets saluted and left the ship. A moment later\r\nRoger and Astro joined Strong and Tom on the control deck.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Strong, \"what nonsense have you three planned for your\r\nleave? Try and see Liddy Tamal. I hear she's making a new stereo about\r\nthe Solar Guard. You might be hired as technical assistants.\" He smiled.\r\nThe famous actress was a favorite of the cadets. Strong waited. \"Well,\r\nis it a secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was your idea, Astro,\" said Roger. \"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Tom. \"You got us into this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" mumbled Astro, turning red with embarrassment, \"we're going\r\nto Venus.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's so unusual about going to Venus?\" asked Strong.\r\n\r\n\"We're going hunting,\" replied Astro.\r\n\r\n\"Hunting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" gulped the big Venusian. \"For tyrannosaurus.\"\r\n\r\nStrong's jaw dropped and he sat down suddenly on the nearest\r\nacceleration cushion. \"I expected something a little strange from you\r\nthree whiz kids.\" He laughed. \"It would be impossible for you to go home\r\nand relax for a month. But this blasts me! Hunting for a tyrannosaurus!\r\nWhat are you going to do with it after you catch it?\" He paused and then\r\nadded, \"If you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat it,\" said Astro simply. \"Tyrannosaurus steak is delicious!\"\r\n\r\nStrong doubled with laughter at the seriousness of Astro's expression.\r\nThe giant Venusian continued doggedly, \"And besides, there's a bounty on\r\nthem. A thousand credits for every tyranno head brought in. They're\r\ndangerous and destroy a lot of crops.\"\r\n\r\nStrong straightened up. \"All right, all right! Go ahead! Have yourselves\r\na good time, but don't take any unnecessary chances. I like my cadets to\r\nhave all the arms and legs and heads they're supposed to have.\" He\r\npaused and glanced at his watch. \"You'd better get hopping. Astro, did\r\nyou get the pile ready for the soup wagon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Tom, secure the ship.\" He came to attention. \"Unit,\r\n_stand--to_!\"\r\n\r\nThe three cadets stiffened and saluted sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Unit dismissed!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Strong turned and left the ship.\r\n\r\nHurriedly, Tom, Roger, and Astro checked the great spaceship and fifteen\r\nminutes later were racing out of the main air lock. Hitching a ride on a\r\njet sled to the nearest slidewalk, they were soon being whisked along\r\ntoward their quarters. Already, cadet units were standing around in\r\nfresh blues waiting for the call for final dress parade.\r\n\r\nAt exactly fifteen hundred, the entire Cadet Corps stepped off with\r\nelectronic precision for the final drill of the term. By threes, each\r\nunit marching together, with the _Polaris_ unit walking behind the\r\nstandard bearers as honor unit, they passed the reviewing stand. Senior\r\nofficers of the Solar Guard, delegates from the Solar Alliance, and\r\nstaff officers of the Academy accepted their salute. Commander Walters\r\nstood stiffly in front of the stand, his heart filled with pride as he\r\nrecognized the honor unit. He had almost washed out the _Polaris_ unit\r\nin the beginning of their Academy training.\r\n\r\nMajor Lou Connel, Senior Line Officer of the Solar Guard, stepped\r\nforward when the cadets came to a stop and presented Tom, Roger, and\r\nAstro with the emblem of their achievement, a small gold pin in the\r\nshape of a rocket ship. He, too, had had his difficulties with the\r\n_Polaris_ unit, and while he had never been heard to compliment anyone\r\non anything, expecting nothing but the best all the time, he\r\nnevertheless congratulated them heartily as he gave them their hard-won\r\ntrophy.\r\n\r\nAfter several other awards had been presented, Commander Walters\r\naddressed the Cadet Corps, concluding with \"... each of you has had a\r\ntough year. But when you come back in four weeks, you'll think this past\r\nterm has been a picnic. And remember, wherever you go, whatever you do,\r\nyou're Space Cadets! Act like one! But above all, have a good time!\r\nSpaceman's luck!\"\r\n\r\nA cadet stepped forward quickly, turned to face the line of cadets, and\r\nheld up his hands. He brought them down quickly and words of the Academy\r\nsong thundered from a thousand voices.\r\n\r\n    \"_From the rocket fields of the Academy\r\n    To the far-flung stars of outer space,\r\n    We're Space Cadets training to be\r\n    Ready for dangers we may face.\r\n\r\n    Up in the sky, rocketing past,\r\n    Higher than high, faster than fast,\r\n    Out into space, into the sun,\r\n    Look at her go when we give her the gun.\r\n\r\n    We are Space Cadets, and we are proud to say\r\n    Our fight for right will never cease.\r\n    Like a cosmic ray, we light the way\r\n    To interplanet peace!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_Dis_-missed!\" roared Walters. Immediately the precise lines of cadets\r\nturned into a howling mob of eager boys, everyone seemingly running in a\r\ndifferent direction.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said Roger. \"I've got everything set! Let's get to the\r\nstation ahead of the mob.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about our gear?\" said Tom. \"We've got to get back to the\r\ndorm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had it sent down to the station last night. I got the monorail\r\ntickets to Atom City last week, and reserved seats on the _Venus Lark_\r\ntwo weeks ago! Come on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Only Roger could handle it so sweetly,\" sighed Astro. \"You know,\r\nhotshot, sometimes I think you're useful!\"\r\n\r\nThe three cadets turned and raced across the quadrangle for the nearest\r\nslidewalk that would take them to the Academy monorail station and the\r\nbeginning of their adventure in the jungles of Venus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The situation may be serious and it may not, but I don't want to take\r\nany chances.\"\r\n\r\nCommander Walters sat in his office, high up in the Tower of Galileo,\r\nwith department heads from the Academy and Solar Guard. Behind him, an\r\nentire wall made of clear crystal offered a breath-taking view of the\r\nAcademy grounds. Before him, their faces showing their concern over a\r\nreport Walters had just read, Captain Strong, Major Connel, Dr. Joan\r\nDale, and Professor Sykes waited for the commanding officer of the\r\nAcademy to continue.\r\n\r\n\"As you know,\" said Walters, \"the resolution passed by the Council in\r\nestablishing the Solar Guard specifically states that it shall be the\r\nduty of the Solar Guard to investigate and secure evidence for the Solar\r\nAlliance Council of any acts by any person, or group of persons,\r\nsuspected of overt action against the Solar Constitution or the\r\nUniversal Bill of Rights. Now, based on the report I've just read to\r\nyou, I would like an opinion from each of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose, Commander?\" asked Joan Dale, the young and pretty\r\nastrophysicist.\r\n\r\n\"To decide whether it would be advisable to have a full and open\r\ninvestigation of this information from the Solar Guard attaché on\r\nVenus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why waste time talking?\" snapped Professor Sykes, the chief of the\r\nnucleonics laboratory. \"Let's investigate. That report sounds serious.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Connel leveled a beady eye on the little gray-haired man.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Sykes, an investigation is serious. When it is based on a\r\nreport like this one, it is doubly serious, and needs straight and\r\ncareful thinking. We don't want to hurt innocent people.\"\r\n\r\nSykes shifted around in his chair and glared at the burly Solar Guard\r\nofficer. \"Don't try to tell me anything about straight thinking, Connel.\r\nI know more about the Solar Constitution and the rights of our citizens\r\nthan you'll know in ten thousand light years!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\" roared Connel. \"And with all your brains you'd probably find out\r\nthese people are nothing more than a harmless bunch of colonists out on\r\na picnic!\"\r\n\r\nThe professor shot out of his chair and waved an angry finger under\r\nConnel's nose. \"And that would be a lot more than I'm finding out right\r\nnow with that contraption of yours!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nConnel's face turned red. \"So that's how you feel about my invention!\"\r\nhe snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the way I feel about your invention!\" replied Sykes hotly.\r\n\"I know three cadets that could build that gadget in half the time it's\r\ntaken you just to figure out the theory!\"\r\n\r\nCommander Walters, Captain Strong, and Joan Dale were fighting to keep\r\nfrom laughing at the hot exchange between the two veteran spacemen.\r\n\r\n\"They sound like the _Polaris_ unit,\" Joan whispered to Strong.\r\n\r\nWalters stood up. \"Gentlemen! Please! We're here to discuss a report on\r\nthe activities of a secret organization on Venus. I will have to ask you\r\nto keep to the subject at hand. Dr. Dale, do you have any comments on\r\nthe report?\" He turned to the young physicist who was choking off a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Commander,\" she began, still smiling, \"the report is rather\r\nsketchy. I would like to see more information before any real decision\r\nis made.\"\r\n\r\nWalters turned to Strong. \"Steve?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Joan has the right idea, sir,\" he replied. \"While the report\r\nindicates that a group of people on Venus are meeting regularly and\r\nsecretly, and wearing some silly uniform, I think we need more\r\ninformation before ordering a full-scale investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's right, Commander,\" Connel broke in. \"You just can't walk into an\r\noutfit and demand a look at their records, books, and membership index,\r\nunless you're pretty sure you'll find something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send a man from here,\" Strong suggested. \"If you use anyone out of the\r\nVenus office, he might be recognized.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good idea,\" commented Sykes.\r\n\r\nJoan nodded. \"Sounds reasonable.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel about it, Connel?\" asked Walters.\r\n\r\nConnel, still furious over Sykes's comment on his spectrum recorder,\r\nshot an angry glance at the professor. \"I think it's fine,\" he said\r\nbluntly. \"Who're you going to send?\"\r\n\r\nWalters paused before answering. He glanced at Strong and then back at\r\nConnel. \"What about yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" continued Walters. \"You know as much about Venus as anyone,\r\nand you have a lot of friends there you can trust. Nose around a while,\r\nsee what you can learn, unofficially.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about my work on the spectrum recorder?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"That!\" snorted Sykes derisively. \"Huh, that can be completed any time\r\nyou want to listen to some plain facts about--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll never listen to anything you have to say, you dried-up old neutron\r\nchaser!\" blasted Connel.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" cackled Sykes. \"And it's the same bullheaded\r\nstubbornness that'll keep you from finishing that recorder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, gentlemen,\" said Walters firmly. \"I cannot allow personal\r\ndiscussions to interfere with the problem at hand. How about it, Connel?\r\nWill you go to Venus?\"\r\n\r\nLou Connel was the oldest line officer in the Solar Guard, having\r\nrecommended the slightly younger Walters for the post of commandant of\r\nSpace Academy and the Solar Guard so that he himself could escape a desk\r\njob and continue blasting through space where he had devoted his entire\r\nlife. While Walters had the authority to order him to accept the\r\nassignment, Connel knew that if he begged off because of his work on the\r\nrecorder, Walters would understand and offer the assignment to Strong.\r\nHe paused and then growled, \"When do I blast off?\"\r\n\r\nWalters smiled and answered, \"As soon as we contact Venus headquarters\r\nand tell them to expect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be better to let me go without any fanfare?\" mused the\r\nburly spaceman. \"I could just take a ship and act as though I'm on some\r\nkind of special detail. As a matter of fact, Higgleston at the Venusport\r\nlab has some information I could use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything Higgleston could tell you,\" interjected Sykes, \"I can tell\r\nyou! You're just too stubborn to listen to me.\"\r\n\r\nConnel opened his mouth to blast the professor in return, but he caught\r\na sharp look from Walters and he clamped his lips together tightly.\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's it, then,\" said Walters. \"Anyone have any other ideas?\"\r\nHe glanced around the room. \"Joan? Steve?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Dale and Captain Strong shook their heads silently. Strong was\r\ndisappointed that he had not been given the assignment on Venus. Four\r\nweeks at the deserted Academy would seem like living in a graveyard.\r\nWalters sensed his feelings, and smiling, he said, \"You've been going\r\nlike a hot rocket this past year, Steve. I have a specific assignment\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" Strong looked up eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to go to the Sweet Water Lakes around New Chicago--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"--go to my cabin--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"--_and go fishing_!\"\r\n\r\nStrong grinned. \"Thanks, skipper,\" he said quietly. \"I guess I could use\r\na little relaxation. I was almost tempted to join Corbett, Manning, and\r\nAstro. They're going hunting in the jungle belt of Venus for a\r\ntyrannosaurus!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blast my jets!\" roared Connel. \"Those boys haven't killed themselves in\r\nline of duty, so they go out and tangle with the biggest and most\r\ndangerous monster in the entire solar system!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Joan with a smile, \"I'll put my money on Astro against a\r\ntyranno any time, pound for pound!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" chimed in Sykes, and forgetting his argument with Connel,\r\nhe turned to the spaceman. \"Say, Lou,\" he said, \"when you get to Venus\r\ntell Higgy I said to show you that magnetic ionoscope he's rigging up.\r\nIt might give you some ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" replied Connel, also forgetting the hot exchange of a few\r\nminutes before. He stood up. \"I'll take the _Polaris_, Commander. She's\r\nthe fastest ship available with automatic controls for a solo hop.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's been stripped of her reactant pile, Major,\" said Strong. \"It'll\r\ntake a good eighteen hours to soup her up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take care of it,\" said Connel. \"Are there any specific orders,\r\nCommander?\"\r\n\r\n\"Use your own judgment, Lou,\" said Walters. \"You know what we want and\r\nhow far to go to get it. If you learn anything, we'll start a full-scale\r\ninvestigation. If not, we'll forget the whole matter and no one will get\r\nhurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Solar Guard won't get a reputation of being nosy,\" added\r\nStrong.\r\n\r\nConnel nodded. \"I'll take care of it.\" He shook hands all around, coming\r\nto Sykes last. \"Sorry I lost my temper, Professor,\" he said gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"Forget it, Major.\" Sykes smiled. He really admired the gruff spaceman.\r\n\r\nThe thick-set senior officer came to smart attention, saluted crisply,\r\nturned, and left the office. For the time being, the mysterious trouble\r\non Venus was his responsibility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Atom City express leaving on Track Four!\"\r\n\r\nA metallic voice boomed over the station loud-speaker, as last-minute\r\npassengers boarded the long line of gleaming white monorail cars,\r\nhanging from a single overhead steel rail. In the open doorway of one\r\nof the end cars, a conductor lifted his arm, then paused and waited\r\npatiently as three Space Cadets raced down the stairs and along the\r\nplatform in a headlong dash for the train. They piled inside, almost one\r\non top of the other.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for waiting, sir,\" gasped Tom Corbett.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Cadet,\" said the conductor. \"I couldn't let you waste your\r\nleave waiting for another train.\"\r\n\r\nThe elderly man flipped a switch in the narrow vestibule and the door\r\nclosed with a soft hiss of air. He inserted a light key into a near-by\r\nsocket and twisted it gently, completing a circuit that flashed the \"go\"\r\nlight in the engineer's cab. Almost immediately, the monorail train\r\neased forward, suspended on the overhead rail. By the time the last\r\nbuilding of Space Academy flashed past, the train was rolling along at\r\nfull speed on its dash across the plains to Atom City.\r\n\r\nThe ride to the great metropolis of the North American continent was\r\nfilled with excitement and anticipation for the three members of the\r\n_Polaris_ crew. The cars were crowded with cadets on leave, and while\r\nthere was a lot of joking and horseplay, the few civilian passengers\r\nwere impressed with the gentlemanly bearing of the young spacemen. Tom\r\nand Roger finally settled down to read the latest magazines supplied by\r\nthe monorail company. But Astro headed for the dining car where he\r\nattracted a great deal of attention by his order of a dozen eggs,\r\nfollowed by two orders of waffles and a full quart of milk. Finally,\r\nwhen the dining-car steward called a halt, because it was closing time,\r\nAstro made his way back to Tom and Roger with a plastic bag of French\r\nfried potatoes, and the three boys sat, munching them happily. The\r\ncountryside flashed by in a blur of summer color as the train roared on\r\nat a speed of two hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\nA few hours and four bags of potatoes later, Astro yawned and stretched\r\nhis enormous arms, nearly poking Roger in the eye.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, ya big ape!\" growled Roger. \"Watch the eye!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd never miss it, Manning,\" said Astro. \"Just use your radar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, I like this eye just the way it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're almost there,\" called Tom. He pointed out the crystal window and\r\nthey could see the high peaks of the Rocky Mountain range looming ahead.\r\n\"We cut through the new tunnel in those mountains and we'll be in Atom\r\nCity in ten minutes!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a bustle of activity around them as other cadets roused\r\nthemselves and collected their gear. Once again conversation became\r\nanimated and excited as the train neared its destination. Flashing into\r\nthe tunnel, the line of cars began to slow down, rocking gently.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better go right out to the spaceport,\" said Tom, pulling his gear\r\nout of the recessed rack under his seat. \"Our ship blasts off for Venus\r\nin less than a half-hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy, it'll be a pleasure to ride a spaceship without having to\r\nastrogate,\" said Roger. \"I'll just sit back and take it easy. Hope there\r\nare some good-looking space dolls aboard.\"\r\n\r\nTom turned to Astro. \"You know, Astro,\" he said seriously, \"it's a good\r\nthing we're along to take care of this Romeo. If he were alone, he'd\r\nwind up in another kind of hunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see how Manning's tactics work on a female dasypus\r\nnovemcinctur maximus,\" said Astro with a sly grin.\r\n\r\n\"A female what?\" yelled Roger.\r\n\r\n\"A giant armadillo, Roger,\" Tom explained, laughing. \"Very big and very\r\nmean when they don't like you. Don't forget, everything on Venus grows\r\nbig because of the lighter gravity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" drawled Roger, looking at Astro. \"Big and dumb!\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that again?\" bellowed the giant Venusian, reaching for the\r\nflip cadet. The next moment, Roger was struggling futilely, feet kicking\r\nwildly as Astro held him at arm's length six inches off the floor. The\r\ncadets in the car roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Atom City!\" a voice over the intercar communicator boomed and the boys\r\nlooked out the window to see the towering buildings of Atom City slowly\r\nslide by. The train had scarcely reached a full stop when the three\r\ncadets piled out of the door, raced up the slidestairs, and jumped into\r\na jet cab. Fifteen minutes later they marched up to one of the many\r\nticket counters of the Atom City Interplanetary Spaceport.\r\n\r\n\"Reservations for Cadets Corbett, Manning, and Astro on the _Venus\r\nLark_, please,\" announced Tom.\r\n\r\nThe girl behind the counter ran her finger down a passenger manifest,\r\nnodded, and then suddenly frowned. She turned back to Tom and said, \"I'm\r\nsorry, Cadet, but your reservations have been pre-empted by a priority\r\nlisting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Priority!\" roared Roger. \"But I made those reservations two weeks ago.\r\nIf there was a change, why didn't you tell us before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" said the girl patiently, \"but according to the\r\nmanifest, the priority call just came in a few hours ago. Someone\r\ncontacted Space Academy, but you had already left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, is there another ship for Venusport today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied and picked up another manifest. Glancing at it\r\nquickly, she shook her head. \"There are no open reservations,\" she said.\r\n\"I'm afraid the next flight for Venusport with open reservations isn't\r\nfor four days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blast my jets!\" growled Roger disgustedly. \"Four days!\" He sat down on\r\nhis gear and scowled. Astro leaned against the desk and stared gloomily\r\nat the floor. At that moment a young man with a thin face and a strained\r\nintense look pushed Tom to one side with a curt \"Excuse me!\" and stepped\r\nup to the desk.\r\n\r\n\"You're holding three reservations on the _Venus Lark_,\" he spoke\r\nquickly. \"Priority number four-seven-six, S.D.\"\r\n\r\nTom, Roger, and Astro looked at him closely. They saw him nervously pay\r\nfor his tickets and then walk away quickly without another look at the\r\nticket girl.\r\n\r\n\"Were those our seats, miss?\" asked Tom. The girl nodded.\r\n\r\nThe three cadets stared after the young man who had bumped them off\r\ntheir ship.\r\n\r\n\"The symbol S.D. on the priority stands for Solar Delegate,\" said Roger.\r\n\"Maybe he's a messenger.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man was joined by two other men also dressed in Venusian\r\nclothing, and after a few words, they all turned and stepped onto the\r\nslidewalk rolling out to the giant passenger ship preparing to blast\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"This is the most rocket-blasting bit of luck in the universe!\" growled\r\nRoger. \"Four days!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, Roger,\" said Tom. \"We can spend the four days in Atom City.\r\nMaybe Liddy Tamal is here. We can follow Captain Strong's suggestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even she doesn't make four days delay sound exciting,\" interrupted\r\nRoger. \"Come on. We might as well go back to town or we won't even get a\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up his gear and walked back to the jet cab-stand. Astro and\r\nTom followed the blond-haired cadet glumly.\r\n\r\nThe stand was empty, but a jet cab was just pulling up to the platform\r\nwith a passenger. As the boys walked over to wait at the door, it opened\r\nand a familiar figure in a black-and-gold uniform stepped out.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Strong!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Corbett!\" exclaimed Strong. \"What are you doing here? I thought you\r\nwere aboard the _Venus Lark_.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were bumped out of our reservation by an S.D. priority,\" said Astro.\r\n\r\n\"And we can't get out of here for another four days,\" added Roger\r\nglumly.\r\n\r\nStrong sympathized. \"That's rough, Astro.\" He looked at the three dour\r\nfaces and then said, \"Would you consider getting a free ride to Venus?\"\r\n\r\nThe three cadets looked up hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"Major Connel's taking the _Polaris_ to Venus to complete some work with\r\nProfessor Higgleston in the Venus lab,\" explained Strong. \"If you can\r\nget back to the Academy before he blasts off, he might give you a ride.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks!\" said Roger. \"I'd rather sit here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, Roger,\" said Tom. \"We're on leave, remember? And it's\r\nonly a short hop to Venus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, hotshot,\" added Astro. \"We'll get to Venus faster than the _Venus\r\nLark_, and save money besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" said Roger. \"I guess I can take him for a little while.\"\r\n\r\nStrong suppressed a smile. Roger's reluctance to go with Connel was well\r\nfounded. Any cadet within hailing distance of the hard-bitten spaceman\r\nwas likely to wind up with a bookful of demerits.\r\n\r\n\"Are you on an assignment, sir?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Vacation,\" said Strong. \"Four weeks of fishing at Commander Walters'\r\ncabin at Sweet Water Lakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you pass through New Chicago,\" said Tom, \"you would be welcome to\r\nstop in at my house. Mom and Dad would be mighty happy to meet you. And\r\nI think Billy, my kid brother, would flip a rocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Tom. I might do that if I have time.\" He looked at his\r\nwatch. \"You three had better hurry. I'd advise taking a jetcopter back\r\nto the Academy. You might not make it if you wait for a monorail.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do that, sir,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nThe three boys threw their gear into the waiting cab and piled in.\r\nStrong watched them roar away, frowning in thought. An S.D. priority,\r\nthe highest priority in space, was used only by special couriers on\r\nimportant missions for one of the delegates. He shrugged it off.\r\n\"Getting to be as suspicious as an old space hen,\" he said to himself.\r\n\"Fishing is what I need. A good fight with a trout instead of a space\r\nconspiracy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Blast off--minus--five--four--three--two--one--_zero_!\"\r\n\r\nAs the main drive rockets blasted into life, Tom fell back in his seat\r\nbefore the control panel of the _Polaris_ and felt the growing thrust as\r\nthe giant ship lifted off the ground, accelerating rapidly. He kept his\r\neyes on the teleceiver screen and saw Space Academy fall away behind\r\nthem. On the power deck Astro lay strapped in his acceleration cushion,\r\nhis outstretched hand on the emergency booster rocket switch should the\r\nmain rockets fail before the ship could reach the free fall of space. On\r\nthe radar bridge Roger watched the far-flung stars become brighter as\r\nthe rocket ship hurtled through the dulling layers of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ship reached weightless space, Tom flipped on the gravity\r\ngenerators and put the _Polaris_ on her course to Venus. Almost\r\nimmediately the intercom began to blast.\r\n\r\n\"Now hear this!\" Major Connel's voice roared. \"Corbett, Manning, and\r\nAstro! I don't want any of your space-blasted nonsense on this trip! Get\r\nthis ship to Venusport in the shortest possible time without burning out\r\nthe pump bearings. And, Manning--!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the blond-haired cadet.\r\n\r\n\"If I so much as hear one wisecrack between you and that overgrown\r\nrocket jockey, Astro, I'll log both of you twenty-five demerits!\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, sir,\" acknowledged Roger lazily. \"I rather appreciate\r\nyour relieving me of the necessity of speaking to that space ape!\"\r\n\r\nListening to their voices on the control deck, Tom grinned and waited\r\nexpectantly. He wasn't disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"Ape!\" came a bull-like roar from the power deck. \"Why, you skinny\r\nmoth-eaten piece of space junk--\"\r\n\r\n\"Cadet Astro!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" Astro was suddenly meek.\r\n\r\n\"If you say one more word, I'll bury you in demerits!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"No _buts_!\" roared Connel. \"And you, Manning--!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" chimed in Roger innocently.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your mouth shut!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Roger.\r\n\r\n\"Corbett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm putting you in charge of monitoring the intercom. If those two\r\nspace idiots start jabbering again, call me. That's an order! I'll be in\r\nmy quarters working.\" Connel switched off abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"You hear that, fellows?\" said Tom. \"Knock it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K., Tom,\" replied Roger, \"just keep him out of my sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That goes for me, too,\" added Astro. \"Ape! Just wait till I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Astro!\" Tom interrupted sharply.\r\n\r\n\"O.K., O.K.,\" groaned the big cadet.\r\n\r\nGlancing over the panel once more and satisfying himself that the ship\r\nwas functioning smoothly, Tom sighed and settled back in his seat,\r\nenjoying the temporary peace and solitude. It had been a tough year,\r\nfilled with intensive study in the quest for an officer's commission in\r\nthe Solar Guard. Space Academy was the finest school in the world, but\r\nit was also the toughest. The young cadet shook his head, remembering a\r\nsix-weeks' grind he, Roger, and Astro had gone through on a nuclear\r\nproject. Knowing how to operate an atomic rocket motor was one thing,\r\nbut understanding what went on inside the reactant pile was something\r\nelse entirely. Never had the three cadets worked harder, or more closely\r\ntogether. But Astro's thorough, practical knowledge of basic nucleonics,\r\ncombined with Roger's native wizardry at higher mathematics, and his own\r\nunderstanding of the theory, had enabled them to pull through with a\r\ngrade of seventy-two, the highest average ever made by a cadet unit not\r\nspecializing in physics.\r\n\r\nAs the ship rocketed smoothly through the airless void of space toward\r\nthe misty planet of Venus, Tom made another quick but thorough check of\r\nthe panel, and then returned to his reflections on the past term. It had\r\nbeen particularly difficult since they had missed many valuable hours of\r\nclassroom work and study because of their adventure on the new colony of\r\nRoald (as described in _The Space Pioneers_), but they had come through\r\nsomehow. He shook his head wondering how they had made it. Forty-two\r\nunits had washed out during the term. Instead of getting easier, the\r\ncourses of study were getting more difficult all the time, and in his\r\nspeech on the parade grounds, Commander Walters had promised--\r\n\r\n\"Emergency!\"\r\n\r\nRoger's voice over the intercom brought Tom out of his reverie sharply.\r\n\r\n\"All hands,\" continued the cadet on the radar bridge hurriedly, \"secure\r\nyour stations and get to the jet-boat deck on the double! Emergency!\"\r\n\r\nAs the sharp clang of the emergency alarm rang out, Tom did not stop to\r\nquestion Roger's sudden order. Neutralizing all controls, he leaped for\r\nthe hatch leading below. Taking the ladder four steps at a time, Tom saw\r\nMajor Connel tear out of his quarters. The elder spaceman dived for the\r\nladder himself, not stopping to ask questions. He was automatic in his\r\nreliance on the judgment of others. The few seconds spent in talk could\r\nmean the difference between life and death in space where you seldom got\r\na second chance.\r\n\r\nTom and Connel arrived on the jet-boat deck to find Astro already\r\npreparing the small space craft for launching. As they struggled into\r\nspace suits, Roger appeared. In answer to their questioning looks, he\r\nexplained laconically, \"Unidentifiable object attached to ship on fin\r\nparallel to steering vanes. Thought we'd better go outside first and\r\nexamine later.\"\r\n\r\nConnel nodded his mute agreement, and thirty seconds later the tiny jet\r\nboat was blasting out of the escape lock into space.\r\n\r\nCircling around the ship to the stern, the jet boat, under Major\r\nConnel's sure touch, stopped fifty feet from the still glowing, exhaust\r\ntubes. He and the three cadets stared out at a small metallic boxlike\r\nobject attached to the underside of the stabilizer fin.\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose it is?\" asked Astro.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied Roger, \"but it sure doesn't belong there. That's\r\nwhy I rang the emergency on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were absolutely right, Manning,\" asserted Connel. \"If it's\r\nharmless, we can always get back aboard and nothing's been lost except a\r\nlittle time.\" He rose from the pilot's seat and stepped toward the\r\nhatch. \"Come with me, Corbett. We'll have a look. And bring the\r\nradiation counter along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\"\r\n\r\nTom reached into a near-by locker, and pulling out a small, rectangular\r\nbox with a round hornlike grid in its face, plunged out of the hatch\r\nwith Major Connel and blasted across the fifty-foot gap to the\r\nstabilizer fin of the _Polaris_.\r\n\r\nConnel gestured toward the object on the fin. \"See if she's hot,\r\nCorbett.\"\r\n\r\nThe young cadet pressed a small button on the counter and turned the\r\nhorn toward the mysterious box. Immediately the needle on the dial above\r\nthe horn jumped from white to pink and finally red, quivering against\r\nthe stop pin.\r\n\r\n\"Hot!\" exclaimed Tom. \"She almost kicked the pin off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get off the ship!\" roared Connel. \"It's a fission bomb with a time\r\nfuse!\"\r\n\r\nTom dove at the box and tried to pull it off the stabilizer, but Major\r\nConnel grabbed him by the arm and wrenched him out into space.\r\n\r\n\"You space-blasted idiot!\" Connel growled. \"That thing's liable to go\r\noff any second! Get away from here!\"\r\n\r\nWith a mighty shove, the spaceman sent Tom flying out toward the jet\r\nboat and then jumped to safety himself. Within seconds he and the young\r\ncadet were aboard the jet boat again and, not stopping to answer Astro's\r\nor Roger's questions, he jammed his foot down hard on the acceleration\r\nlever, sending the tiny ship blasting away from the _Polaris_.\r\n\r\nNot until they were two miles away from the stricken rocket ship did\r\nConnel bring the craft to a stop. He turned and gazed helplessly at the\r\ngleaming hull of the _Polaris_.\r\n\r\n\"So they know,\" he said bitterly. \"They're trying to stop me from even\r\nreaching Venus.\"\r\n\r\nThe three cadets looked at each other and then at the burly spaceman,\r\nbewilderment in their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What's this all about, sir?\" Roger finally asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not at liberty to tell you, Manning,\" replied Connel. \"Though I\r\nwant to thank you for your quick thinking. How did you happen to\r\ndiscover the bomb?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was sighting on Regulus for a position check and Regulus was dead\r\nastern, so when I swung the periscope scanner around, I spotted that\r\nthing stuck to the fin. I didn't bother to think about it, I just\r\nyelled.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Glad you did,\" nodded Connel and turned to stare at the _Polaris_\r\nagain. \"Now I'm afraid we'll just have to wait until that bomb goes\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there anything we can do?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Not a blasted thing,\" replied Connel grimly. \"Thank the universe we\r\nshut off all power. If that baby had blown while the reactant was\r\nfeeding into the firing chambers, we'd have wound up a big splash of\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"This way,\" commented Astro sourly, \"it'll just blast a hole in the side\r\nof the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might be able to repair that,\" said Tom hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"There she goes!\" shouted Roger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nStaring out the windshield, they saw a sudden blinding flash of light\r\nappear over the stern section of the _Polaris_, a white-hot blaze of\r\nincandescence that made them flinch and crouch back.\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" exclaimed Connel.\r\n\r\nBefore their eyes they saw the stabilizer fin melt and curl under the\r\nintense heat of the bomb. There was no sound or shock wave in the vacuum\r\nof space, but they all shuddered as though an overwhelming force had\r\nswept over them. Within seconds the flash was gone and the _Polaris_ was\r\ndrifting in the cold blackness of space! The only outward damage visible\r\nwas the twisted stabilizer, but the boys realized that she must be a\r\nshambles within.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we'll have to wait a while before we go back aboard. There\r\nmight be radioactivity around the hull,\" Roger remarked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" said Tom. \"The _Polaris_ was still coasting when we\r\nleft her. We cut out the drive rockets, but we didn't brake her. She's\r\nprobably drifted away from the radioactivity already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Corbett's right,\" said Connel. \"A hot cloud would be a hundred miles\r\naway by now.\" He pressed down on the acceleration lever and the jet boat\r\neased toward the ship. Edging cautiously toward the stern of the\r\nspaceship, they saw the blasted section of the fin already cooling in\r\nthe intense cold of outer space.\r\n\r\n\"Think I'd better call a Solar Guard patrol ship, sir?\" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n\"Let's wait until we check the damage, Manning,\" replied Connel.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" chimed in Astro grimly, \"if I can help it, I'm going to bring\r\nthe _Polaris_ in.\" He paused and then added, \"If I have to carry her on\r\nmy back.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as a quick check with the radiation counter showed them that the\r\nhull was free of radioactivity, Major Connel and the three cadets\r\nre-entered the ship.\r\n\r\nWhile the lack of atmosphere outside had dissipated the full force of\r\nthe blast, the effect on the inside of the ship, where Earth's air\r\npressure was maintained, was devastating. Whole banks of delicate\r\nmachinery were torn from the walls and scattered over the decks. The\r\nprecision instruments of the inner hull showed no signs of leakage, and\r\nthe oxygen-circulating machinery could still function on an auxiliary\r\npower hookup.\r\n\r\nCompleting the quick survey of the ship, Major Connel realized that they\r\nwould never be able to continue their flight to Venus and instructed\r\nRoger to contact the nearest Solar Guard patrol ship to pick them up.\r\n\r\n\"The _Polaris_ will have to be left in space,\" continued Connel, \"and a\r\nmaintenance crew will be sent out to see if she can be repaired. If they\r\ndecide it isn't worth the labor, they'll junk her here in space.\"\r\n\r\nThe faces of the three cadets fell.\r\n\r\n\"But there's no real damage on her power deck, sir,\" said Astro. \"And\r\nthe hull is in good shape, except for the stabilizer fin and some of the\r\nstern plates. Why, sometimes a green Earthworm unit will crack a fin on\r\ntheir first touchdown.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the radar deck can be patched up easy, sir,\" spoke up Roger. \"With\r\nsome new tubes and a few rolls of wire I could have her back in shape in\r\nno time.\"\r\n\r\n\"That goes for the control deck, too!\" said Tom doggedly. Then, after a\r\nquick glance at his unit mates, he faced Connel squarely. \"I think it\r\ngoes without saying, sir, that we'd appreciate it very much if you could\r\nrecommend that she be restored instead of junked.\"\r\n\r\nConnel allowed himself a smile in the face of such obvious love for the\r\nship. \"You forget that to repair her out in space, the parts have to be\r\nhauled from Venus. But I'll see what I can do. Meantime, Roger, see if\r\nyou can't get that patrol ship to give us a lift to Venusport. Tell the\r\nC.O. I'm aboard and on urgent official business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" continued the spaceman, noticing the downcast looks of Tom and\r\nAstro, \"it wouldn't hurt if you two started repairing as much as you\r\ncan. So when the maintenance crew arrives, they won't find her in such a\r\nmess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" chorused the two cadets happily.\r\n\r\nConnel returned to his quarters and sat down heavily in the remains of\r\nhis bunk, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. Somehow, word had gotten out\r\nthat he was going to check on the secret organization on Venus and\r\nsomeone had made a bold and desperate attempt to stop him before he\r\ncould get started. It infuriated him to think that anyone would\r\ninterrupt official business. As far as Connel was concerned, nothing\r\ncame before official business. And he was doubly furious at the danger\r\nto the three cadets, who had innocently hitched a ride on what was\r\nalmost a death ship. Someone was going to pay, Connel vowed, clenching\r\nhis huge fists--and pay dearly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Yeeooowww!_\"\r\n\r\nRoaring with jubilation and jumping high in the air at every other step,\r\nAstro raced out of the gigantic maintenance hangar at the Venusport\r\nspaceport and charged at his two unit mates waiting on the concrete\r\napron.\r\n\r\n\"Everything's O.K.,\" he yelled, throwing his arms around them. \"The\r\n_Polaris_ is going to be brought in for full repairs! I just saw the\r\naudiograph report from the maintenance chief!\"\r\n\r\nTom and Roger broke into loud cheers and pounded each other on the back.\r\n\r\n\"Great Jupiter,\" gasped Roger, \"I feel as though I've been sitting up\r\nwith a sick friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your friend's going to make a full recovery,\" asserted Astro.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see Major Connel?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Astro. \"I think he had a lot to do with it. I saw him\r\ntalking to the head maintenance officer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now that we've sweated the old girl through the crisis,\" asserted\r\nRoger, \"how's about us concentrating on our vacation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Great,\" agreed Tom. \"This is your party, Astro. Lead the way.\"\r\n\r\nThe three cadets left the spaceport in a jet cab and rode happily into\r\nthe city of Venusport. As they slid along the superhighway toward the\r\nfirst and largest of the Venusian cities, Astro pointed out the sights.\r\nLike slim fingers of glass, the towering Titan crystal buildings of the\r\ncity arose before them, reaching above the misty atmosphere to catch the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n\"Where do we get our safari gear, Astro?\" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n\"In the secondhand shops along Spaceman's Row,\" replied the big\r\nVenusian. \"We can get good equipment down there at half the price.\"\r\n\r\nThe cab turned abruptly off the main highway and began twisting through\r\na section of the city shunned by the average Venusian citizen.\r\nSpaceman's Row had a long and unsavory history. For ten square blocks it\r\nwas the hide-out and refuge of the underworld of space. The grimy stores\r\nand shadowy buildings supplied the needs of the countless shadowy\r\nfigures who lived beyond the law and moved as silently as ghosts.\r\n\r\nLeaving the jet cab, the three cadets walked along the streets, past the\r\ncheaply decorated store fronts and dingy hallways, until they finally\r\ncame to a corner shop showing the universal symbol of the pawnshop:\r\nthree golden balls. Tom and Roger looked at Astro who nodded, and they\r\nstepped inside.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the shop was filthy. Rusted and worn space gear was\r\npiled in heaps along the walls and on dusty counters. An old-fashioned\r\nmultiple neon light fixture cast an eerie blue glow over everything.\r\nRoger grimaced as he looked around. \"Are you sure we're in the right\r\nplace, Astro?\"\r\n\r\nTom winked. Roger had a reputation for being fastidious.\r\n\r\n\"This is it,\" nodded Astro. \"I know the old geezer that runs this\r\nplace. Nice guy. Name's Spike.\" He turned to the back of the shop and\r\nbawled, \"Hey, Spike! Customers!\"\r\n\r\nOut of the gloomy darkness a figure emerged slowly. \"Yeah?\" The man\r\nstepped out into the pale light. He dragged one foot as he walked.\r\n\"Whaddaya want?\"\r\n\r\nAstro looked puzzled. \"Where's Spike?\" he asked. \"Doesn't Spike Freyer\r\nown this place?\"\r\n\r\n\"He died a couple months ago. I bought him out just before.\" The\r\ncrippled man eyed the three cadets warily. \"Wanna buy something?\"\r\n\r\nAstro looked shocked. \"Spike, dead? What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know,\" snarled the little man. \"I bought him out and he\r\ndied a few weeks later. Now, you wanna buy something or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're looking for jungle gear,\" said Tom, puzzled by the man's strange\r\nbelligerence.\r\n\r\n\"Jungle gear?\" the man's eyes widened. \"Going hunting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" supplied Roger. \"We need complete outfits for three. But you\r\ndon't look like you have them. Let's go, fellas.\" He turned toward the\r\ndoor, anxious to get out into the open air.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute! Just a minute, Cadet,\" said the proprietor eagerly.\r\n\"I've got some fine hunting gear here! A little used, but you won't mind\r\nthat! Save you at least half on anything you'd buy up in the city.\" He\r\nstarted toward the back of the store and then paused. \"Where you going\r\nhunting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"So I'll know what kind of gear you need. Light--heavy--kind of guns--\"\r\n\r\n\"Jungle belt in the Eastern Hemisphere,\" supplied Astro.\r\n\r\n\"Big game?\" asked the man.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Tyrannosaurus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tyranno, eh?\" nodded the little man. \"Well, now, you'll need heavy\r\nstuff for that. I'd say at least three heavy-duty paralo-ray pistols for\r\nside arms, and three shock rifles. Then you'll need camping equipment,\r\nsynthetics, and all the rest.\" He counted the items off on grubby little\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"Let's take a look at the blasters,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Right this way,\" said the man. He turned and limped to the rear of the\r\nshop, followed by the three cadets. Opening a large cabinet, he pulled\r\nout a heavy rifle, a shock gun that could knock out any living thing at\r\na range of a thousand yards, and stun the largest animal at twice the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\"This blaster will knock the scales off any tyranno that you hit,\" he\r\nsaid, handing the weapon over to Tom who expertly broke it down and\r\nexamined it.\r\n\r\nAs Tom checked the gun, the proprietor turned to the other cadets\r\ncasually.\r\n\r\n\"Why would three cadets want to go into that section of the jungle\r\nbelt?\"\r\n\r\n\"We just told you,\" said Roger. \"We're hunting tyranno.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, yes, of course.\" He turned away and pulled three heavy-duty\r\nparalo-ray pistols out of the cabinet. \"Now these ray guns are the\r\nfinest money can buy. Standard Solar Guard equipment....\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get them?\" demanded Roger sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know how it is, Cadet.\" The man laughed. \"One way or another,\r\nwe get a lot of gear. A man is discharged from the Solar Guard and he\r\ncan keep his equipment, then he gets hard up for a few credits and so he\r\ncomes to me.\"\r\n\r\nTom closed the shock rifle and turned to Astro. \"This gun is clean\r\nenough. Think it can stop a tyranno, Astro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said the big cadet confidently. \"Easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" announced Tom, turning back to the proprietor. \"Give us the rest\r\nof the stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"And watch your addition when you make out the bill,\" said Roger\r\nblandly. \"We can add, too.\"\r\n\r\nA half-hour later the three cadets stood in front of the shop with all\r\nthe gear they would need and hailed a jet cab. They stowed their newly\r\npurchased equipment inside and started to climb in as Astro announced,\r\n\"Spaceport, driver!\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\" Roger paused. \"Why back there?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you think we're going to get to the jungle belt?\" asked Astro.\r\n\"Walk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"We have to rent a jet launch,\" said Astro. \"Or try to buy a used one\r\nthat we can sell back again. Pile in, now!\"\r\n\r\nAs the cab shot away from the curb with the three cadets, the proprietor\r\nof the pawnshop stepped out of the doorway and watched it disappear, a\r\npuzzled frown on his face. Quickly he re-entered the shop, and limping\r\nto a small locker in the rear, opened it, exposing the screen of a\r\nteleceiver. He flipped on the switch, tuned it carefully, and in a\r\nmoment the screen glowed to life.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, this is the shop,\" called the little man. \"Lemme speak to Lactu!\r\nThis is urgent!\" As he waited he stared out through the dirty window to\r\nthe street where the cadets had been a moment before and he smiled\r\nthinly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArriving at the spaceport, Astro led his unit mates to a privately owned\r\nrepair hangar and dry dock where wealthier Venusian citizens kept their\r\nspace yachts, jet-powered craft, and small runabouts. Astro opened the\r\ndoor to the office with a bang, and a young girl, operating an automatic\r\ntypewriter, looked up.\r\n\r\n\"Astro!\" she cried. \"How wonderful to see you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hiya, Agnes,\" replied Astro shyly. The big cadet was well known and\r\nliked at the repair hangar. His early life had been spent in and around\r\nthe spaceport. First just listening to the stories of the older spacemen\r\nand running errands for them, then lending a helping hand wherever he\r\ncould, and finally becoming a rigger and mechanic. This all preceded his\r\nyears as an enlisted spaceman and his eventual appointment to Space\r\nAcademy. His big heart and honesty, his wild enthusiasm for any kind of\r\nrocket power had won him many friends.\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Keene around?\" asked Astro.\r\n\r\n\"He's with a customer right now,\" replied Agnes. \"He'll be out in a\r\nminute.\" Her eyes swept past Astro to Tom and Roger who were standing in\r\nthe doorway. \"Who are your friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, excuse me!\" mumbled Astro. \"These are my unit mates, Cadet Corbett\r\nand Cadet Manning.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Tom could acknowledge the introduction, Roger stepped in front of\r\nhim and sat on the edge of the desk. Looking into her eyes, he\r\nannounced, \"Tell you what, Astro, you and Tom go hunting. I've found all\r\nI could ever want to find right here. Tell me, my little space pet, are\r\nyou engaged for dinner tonight?\"\r\n\r\nAgnes looked back into his eyes innocently. \"As a matter of fact I am.\"\r\nThen, grinning mischievously, she added, \"But don't let that stop you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't let a tyranno stop me,\" bragged the blond-haired cadet.\r\n\"Tell me who your previous engagement is with and I'll get rid of him in\r\nnothing flat!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl giggled and looked past Roger. He turned to see a tall, solidly\r\nbuilt man in coveralls scowling at him.\r\n\r\n\"Friend of yours, Agnes?\" the newcomer asked.\r\n\r\n\"Friend of Astro's, Roy,\" said Agnes. \"Cadet Manning, I'd like you to\r\nmeet my brother, Roy Keene.\"\r\n\r\nRoger jumped up and stuck out his hand. \"Oh--er--ah--how do you do,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well, Cadet,\" replied Keene gruffly, but with a slight twinkle in\r\nhis eye. He turned to Astro and gripped the big cadet's hand solidly.\r\n\"Well, Astro, it's good to see you. How's everything going at Space\r\nAcademy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swell, sir,\" replied Astro, and after introducing Tom and bringing\r\nKeene up to date on his life history, he explained the purpose of their\r\nvisit. \"We're on summer leave, sir, and we'd like to go hunting\r\ntyrannosaurus. But what we need most right now is a jet boat. We'd like\r\nto rent one, or if you've got something cheap, we'd buy it.\"\r\n\r\nKeene rubbed his chin. \"I'm afraid I can't help you, Astro. There's\r\nnothing available in the shop right now. I'd lend you my Beetle, but one\r\nof the boys has it out on a three-day repair job.\"\r\n\r\nAstro's face fell. \"Oh, that's too bad.\" He turned to Tom and Roger.\r\n\"Well, we could drop in from a stratosphere cruiser and then work our\r\nway back to the nearest colony in three or four weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" exclaimed Keene. \"I've got an idea.\" He turned and\r\ncalled to a man standing on the other side of the hangar, studying a\r\nradar scanner for private yachts. \"Hey, Rex, mind coming over here a\r\nminute.\"\r\n\r\nThe man walked over. He was in his late thirties, tall and\r\nbroad-shouldered, his hair was almost snow-white, contrasting sharply\r\nwith his deeply tanned and handsome features.\r\n\r\n\"This is the _Polaris_ unit from Space Academy, Rex,\" said Keene. \"Boys,\r\nmeet Rex Sinclair.\" After the introductions were completed, Keene\r\nexplained the cadets' situation. Sinclair broke into a smile. \"It would\r\nbe a pleasure to have you three boys as my guests!\"\r\n\r\n\"Guests!\" exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\nSinclair nodded. \"I have a plantation right on the edge of the jungle\r\nbelt. Things get pretty dull down there in the middle of the summer. I'd\r\nbe honored if you'd use my home as a base of operations while you hunt\r\nfor your tyrannosaurus. As a matter of fact, you'd be helping me out.\r\nThose brutes destroy a lot of my crops and we have to go after them\r\nevery three or four years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thanks,\" said Tom, \"but we wouldn't want to impose. We'd be happy\r\nto pay you--\"\r\n\r\nSinclair held up his hand. \"Wouldn't think of it. Do you have your\r\ngear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Astro. \"Arms, synthetics, the works. Everything but\r\ntransportation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's sitting out on the spaceport. That black space yacht on\r\nRamp Three.\" Sinclair smiled. \"Get your gear aboard and make yourselves\r\nat home. I'll be ready to blast off in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nAstro turned to Keene. \"Thanks a lot, sir. It was swell of you to set us\r\nup this way.\"\r\n\r\nKeene slapped him on the shoulder. \"Go on. Have a good time.\"\r\n\r\nShaking hands all around and saying quick good-bys, the three boys\r\nhurried out to stow their gear aboard Sinclair's luxurious space yacht.\r\nWhile Roger and Tom relaxed in the comfortable main cabin, Astro hurried\r\nbelow to inspect the power deck.\r\n\r\nRoger laughed as the big cadet disappeared down the hatch. \"That guy\r\nwould rather play with a rocket tube than do anything else in the\r\nuniverse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tom. \"He's a real lucky guy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ever meet anyone that didn't love that big hick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" said Roger with a sly grin. \"And that goes for me too! But don't\r\nyou ever tell him!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMajor Connel had been waiting to see the Solar Alliance Delegate from\r\nVenus for three hours. And Major Connel didn't like to wait for anyone\r\nor anything. He had read every magazine in the lavish outer office atop\r\nthe Solar Guard Building in downtown Venusport, drunk ten glasses of\r\nwater, and was now wearing a path in the rug as he paced back and forth\r\nin front of the secretary who watched him shyly.\r\n\r\nThe buzzer on the desk finally broke the silence and the girl answered\r\nquickly as Connel stopped and glared at her expectantly. She listened\r\nfor a second, then replacing the receiver, turned to the seething Solar\r\nGuard officer and smiled sweetly. \"Delegate James will see you now,\r\nMajor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Connel gruffly, trying hard not to take his impatience\r\nout on the pretty girl. He stepped toward an apparently solid wall that\r\nsuddenly slid back as he passed a light beam and entered the spacious\r\noffice of E. Philips James, Venusian Delegate to the Grand Council of\r\nthe Solar Alliance.\r\n\r\nE. Philips James was a small man, with small hands that were moving\r\nnervously all the time. His head was a little too large for his narrow\r\nbody that was clothed in the latest fashion, and his tiny black mustache\r\nwas carefully trimmed. As Connel stalked into the room, James bounced\r\nout of his chair to meet him, smiling warmly.\r\n\r\n\"Major Connel! How delightful to see you again,\" he said, extending a\r\nperfumed hand.\r\n\r\n\"You could have seen me a lot sooner,\" growled Connel. \"I've been\r\nsitting outside for over three hours!\"\r\n\r\nJames lifted one eyebrow and sat down without making any comment. A true\r\ndiplomat, E. Philips James never said anything unless it was absolutely\r\nnecessary. And when he spoke, he never really said very much. He sat\r\nback and waited patiently for Connel to cool off and get to the point of\r\nhis call.\r\n\r\nIn typical fashion, Connel jumped to it without any idle conversational\r\nprologue. \"I'm here on a security assignment. I need confidential\r\ninformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just one moment, Major,\" said James. He flipped open his desk intercom\r\nand called to his secretary outside. \"Record this conversation, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Record!\" roared Connel. \"I just told you this was secret!\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be secret, Major,\" assured James softly. \"The record will go\r\ninto the confidential files of the Alliance for future reference. A\r\nprecaution, Major. Standard procedure. Please go on.\"\r\n\r\nConnel hesitated, and then, shrugging his shoulders, continued, \"I want\r\nto know everything you know about an organization here on Venus known as\r\nthe Venusian Nationalists.\"\r\n\r\nJames's expression changed slightly. \"Specific information, Major? Or\r\njust random bits of gossip?\"\r\n\r\n\"No rocket wash, Mr. James. Information. Everything you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why you've come to me,\" replied James, visibly annoyed at\r\nthe directness of the rough spaceman. \"I know really very little.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm working under direct orders of Commander Walters,\" said Connel\r\ngrimly, \"who is also a delegate to the Solar Council. His position as\r\nhead of the Solar Guard is equal to yours in every respect. This request\r\ncomes from his office, not out of my personal curiosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, of course, Major,\" replied James. \"Of course.\"\r\n\r\nThe delegate rose and walked over to the window, seemingly trying to\r\ncollect his thoughts. After a moment he turned back. \"Major, the\r\norganization you speak of is, so far as I know, an innocent group of\r\nVenusian farmers and frontier people who meet regularly to exchange\r\ninformation about crops, prices, and the latest farming methods. You\r\nsee, Major\"--James's voice took on a slightly singsong tone, as though\r\nhe were making a speech--\"Venus is a young planet, a vast new world,\r\nwith Venusport the only large metropolis and cultural center. Out in\r\nthe wilderness, there are great tracts of cultivated land that supply\r\nfood to the planets of the Solar Alliance and her satellites. We are\r\nbecoming the breadbasket of the universe, you might say.\" James smiled\r\nat Connel, who did not return the smile.\r\n\r\n\"Great distances separate these plantations,\" continued James. \"Life is\r\nhard and lonely for the Venusian plantation owner. The Venusian\r\nNationalists are, to my knowledge, no more than a group of landowners\r\nwho have gotten together and formed a club, a fraternity. It's true they\r\nspeak the Venusian dialect, these groups have taken names from the old\r\nVenusian explorers, but I hardly think it is worth while investigating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they have a headquarters?\" Connel asked. \"A central meeting place?\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as I know, they don't. But Al Sharkey, the owner of the largest\r\nplantation on Venus, is the president of the organization. He's a very\r\namiable fellow. Why don't you talk to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Al Sharkey, eh?\" Connel made a mental note of the name.\r\n\r\n\"And there's Rex Sinclair, a rather stubborn individualist who wrote to\r\nme recently complaining that he was being pressured into joining the\r\norganization.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of pressure?\" asked Connel sharply.\r\n\r\nJames held up his hand. \"Don't get me wrong, Major. There was no\r\nviolence.\" The delegate suddenly became very businesslike. \"I'm afraid\r\nthat's all the information I can give you, Major.\" He offered his hand.\r\n\"So nice to see you again. Please don't hesitate to call on me again for\r\nany assistance you feel we can give you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. James,\" said Connel gruffly and left the office, a frown\r\ncreasing his forehead. Being a straightforward person himself, Major\r\nConnel could not understand why anyone would hesitate about answering a\r\ndirect question. He didn't for a moment consider the delegate anything\r\nbut an intelligent man. It was the rocket wash that went with being a\r\ndiplomat that annoyed the ramrod spaceman. He shrugged it off. Perhaps\r\nhe would find out something from Al Sharkey or the other plantation\r\nowner, Rex Sinclair.\r\n\r\nWhen he crossed the slidewalk and waited at the curb for a jet cab,\r\nConnel suddenly paused and looked around. He felt a strange excitement\r\nin the air--a kind of tension. The faces of passing pedestrians seemed\r\nstrained, intense, their eyes were glowing, as though they all were in\r\non some huge secret. He saw groups of men and women sitting in open\r\nsidewalk cafés, leaning over the table to talk to each other, their\r\nvoices low and guarded. Connel shivered. He didn't like it. Something\r\nwas happening on Venus and he had to find out what it was before it was\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wow!\" exclaimed Roger.\r\n\r\n\"Jumping Jupiter!\" commented Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Blast my jets!\" roared Astro.\r\n\r\nRex Sinclair smiled as he maneuvered the sleek black space yacht in a\r\ntight circle a thousand feet above the Titan crystal roof of his\r\nluxurious home in the heart of the wild Venusian jungle.\r\n\r\n\"She's built out of Venusian teak,\" said Sinclair. \"Everything but the\r\nroof. I wanted to keep the feeling of the jungle around me, so I used\r\nthe trees right out of the jungle there.\" He pointed to the sea of dense\r\ntropical growth that surrounded the house and cleared land.\r\n\r\nThe ship nosed up for a thousand yards and then eased back, smoothly\r\nbraked, to a concrete ramp a thousand yards from the house. The\r\ntouchdown was as gentle as a falling leaf, and when Sinclair opened the\r\nair lock, a tall man in worn but clean fatigues was waiting for them.\r\n\r\n\"Howdy, Mr. Sinclair,\" he called, a smile on his lined, weather-beaten\r\nface. \"Have a good trip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine trip, George,\" replied Sinclair, climbing out of the ship. \"I want\r\nyou to meet some friends of mine. Space Cadets Tom Corbett, Roger\r\nManning, and Astro. They're going to stay with us during their summer\r\nleave while they hunt for tyranno. Boys, this is my foreman, George\r\nHill.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys shook hands with the thick-set, muscular man, who smiled\r\nbroadly. \"Glad to meet you, boys. Always wanted to talk to someone from\r\nthe Academy. Wanted to go there myself but couldn't pass the physical.\r\nBad eyes.\"\r\n\r\nReaching into the ship, he began lifting out their equipment. \"You chaps\r\ngo on up to the house now,\" he said. \"I'll take care of your gear.\"\r\n\r\nWith Sinclair leading the way, the boys slowly walked up a flagstone\r\npath toward the house, and they had their first chance to see a Venusian\r\nplantation home at close range.\r\n\r\nThe Sinclair house stood in the middle of a clearing more than five\r\nthousand yards square. At the edges, like a solid wall of green\r\nvegetation, the Venusian jungle rose more than two hundred feet. It was\r\nnoon and the heat was stifling. They were twenty-six million miles\r\ncloser to the sun, and on the equator of the misty planet. While Astro,\r\nGeorge, and Sinclair didn't seem to mind the temperature, Tom and Roger\r\nwere finding it unbearable.\r\n\r\n\"Can you imagine what it'll be like in the house with that crystal\r\nroof!\" whispered Roger.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet,\" replied Tom. \"But as soon as the sun drops out of the\r\nzenith, it should cool off some.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the group stepped up onto the porch, two house servants met them\r\nand took their gear. Then Sinclair and the foreman ushered the cadets\r\ninside. They were surprised to feel a distinct drop in temperature.\r\n\r\n\"Your cooling unit must be pretty large, Mr. Sinclair,\" commented Tom,\r\nlooking up at the crystal roof where the sun was clearly visible.\r\n\r\nSinclair smiled. \"That's special crystal, mined on Titan at a depth of\r\nten thousand feet. It's tinted, and shuts out the heat and glare of the\r\nsun.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge then left to lay out their gear for their first hunt the next\r\nmorning, and Sinclair took them on a tour of the house. They walked\r\nthrough long corridors looking into all the rooms, eventually winding up\r\nin the kitchen, and the three boys marveled at the simplicity yet\r\nabsolute perfection of the place. Every modern convenience was at hand\r\nfor the occupant's comfort. When the sun had dropped a little, they all\r\nput on sunglasses with glareproof eye shields and walked around the\r\nplantation. Sinclair showed them his prize-winning stock and the vast\r\nfields of crops. Aside from the main house, there were only four other\r\nbuildings in the clearing. They visited the smallest, a cowshed.\r\n\r\n\"Where do your field hands live, Mr. Sinclair?\" asked Tom, as they\r\nwalked through the modern, spotless, milking room.\r\n\r\n\"I don't have any,\" replied the planter. \"Do most of the work with\r\nmachinery, and George and the houseboys do what has to be done by hand.\"\r\n\r\nAs they left the shed and started back toward the main house they came\r\nabreast of a small wooden structure. Thinking they were headed there,\r\nRoger started to open the door.\r\n\r\n\"Close that door!\" snapped Sinclair. Roger jerked back. Astro and Tom\r\nlooked at the planter, startled by the sharpness in his voice.\r\n\r\nSinclair smiled and explained, \"We keep some experiments on different\r\nkinds of plants in there at special low temperatures. You might have let\r\nin hot air and ruined something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" said Roger. \"I didn't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget it,\" replied the planter. \"Well, let's get back to the house.\r\nWe're having an early dinner. You boys have to get started at four\r\no'clock in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four o'clock!\" exclaimed Roger.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"We have to go deep into the thicket,\" Astro explained, using the local\r\nterm for the jungle, \"so that at high noon we can make camp and take a\r\nbreak. You can't move out there at noon. It gets so hot you'd fall on\r\nyour face after fifteen minutes of fighting the creepers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything stops at noon,\" added Sinclair. \"Even the tyrannosaurus. You\r\nhave to do your traveling in the cool of the day, early and late. Six\r\nhours or so will take you far enough away from the plantation to find\r\ntracks, if there are any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Mr. Sinclair,\" asked Roger suddenly, \"is this the whole\r\nplantation?\" He spread his hands in a wide arc, taking in the clearing\r\nto the edge of the jungle.\r\n\r\nSinclair grinned. \"Roger, it'd take a man two weeks to go from one\r\ncorner of my property to another. This is just where I live. Three years\r\nago I had five hundred square miles under cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nBack in the house, they found George setting the table on the porch and\r\nhis wife busy in the kitchen. Mrs. Hill was a stout woman, with a\r\npleasant face and a ready smile. With very little ceremony, the cadets,\r\nSinclair, George, and his wife sat down to eat. The food was simple\r\nfare, but the sure touch of Mrs. Hill's cooking and the free use of\r\ndelicate Venusian jungle spices added exotic flavor, new but immensely\r\nsatisfying to the three hungry boys, a satisfaction they demonstrated by\r\ncleaning their plates quickly and coming back for second helpings.\r\nAstro, of course, was not happy until he had polished off his fourth\r\nround. Mrs. Hill beamed with pleasure at their unspoken compliment to\r\nher cooking.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, Mrs. Hill stacked the dishes and put them into a small\r\ncarrier concealed in the wall. Pressing a button, near the opening, she\r\nexplained, \"That dingus takes them to the sink, washes them, dries them,\r\nand puts everything in its right place. That's the kind of modern living\r\nI like!\"\r\n\r\nAs the sun dropped behind the wall of the jungle and the sky darkened,\r\nthey all relaxed. Sinclair and George smoked contentedly, Mrs. Hill\r\nbrought out some needle point, and the three cadets rested in\r\ncomfortable contour chairs. They chatted idly, stopping only to listen\r\nto the wild calls of birds and animals out in the jungle as George, or\r\nSinclair, identified them all. George told of his experiences on\r\ntyrannosaurus hunts, and Astro described his method of hunting as a boy.\r\n\r\n\"I was a big kid,\" he explained. \"And since the only way of earning a\r\nliving was by working, I found I could combine business with pleasure. I\r\nused to hitch rides over the belt and parachute in to hunt for baby\r\ntyrannos.\" He grinned and added, \"When I think back, I wonder how I ever\r\nstayed in one piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Land sakes!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hill. \"It's a wonder you weren't eaten\r\nalive! Those tyrannos are horrible things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was almost a meal once,\" confessed Astro sheepishly, and at the\r\nurging of the others he described the incident that had cured him of\r\nhunting alone in the jungles of Venus with only a low-powered shock\r\nblaster.\r\n\r\n\"If I didn't get it at the base of the brain where the nerve centers\r\naren't so well protected with the first shot, I was in trouble,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I took a lot of chances, but was careful not to tangle with a\r\nmama or papa tyrannosaurus. I'd stalk the young ones. I'd wait for him\r\nto feed and then let him have it. If I was lucky, I'd get him with one\r\nshot, but most of the time I'd just stun him and have to finish him off\r\nwith a second blast. Then I'd skin him, take the hams and shoulders, and\r\nget out of there fast before the wild dogs got wind of the blood. I'd\r\nusually hunt pretty close to a settlement where I could get the meat\r\nfrozen. After that, I'd just have to call a couple of the big\r\nrestaurants in Venusport and get the best price. I used to make as much\r\nas fifty credits on one kill.\"\r\n\r\n\"How would you get the meat to Venusport?\" asked Roger, who, for all his\r\nbraggadocio, was awed by his unit mate's calm bravery and skill as a\r\nhunter.\r\n\r\n\"The restaurant that bought it would send a jet boat out for it and I'd\r\nride back with it. After a while the restaurant owners got to know me\r\nand would give me regular orders. I was trying to fill a special order\r\non that last hunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Tom, equally impressed with Astro's life as a boy\r\nhunter.\r\n\r\n\"I had just about finished hunting in a section near a little settlement\r\non the other side of Venus,\" began the big cadet, \"but I thought there\r\nmight be one more five-hundred-pound baby around, so I dropped in.\"\r\nAstro paused and grinned. \"I didn't find a baby, I found his mother! She\r\nmust have weighed twenty-five or thirty tons. Biggest tyranno I've ever\r\nseen. She spotted me the same time I saw her and I didn't even stop to\r\nfire. I never could have dented her hide. I started running and she came\r\nafter me. I made it to a cave and went as far back inside as I could.\r\nShe stuck her head in after me, and by the craters of Luna, she was only\r\nabout three feet away, with me backed up against a wall. She tried to\r\nget farther in, opened her mouth, and snapped and roared like twenty\r\nrocket cruisers going off at once.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_She tried to get farther into the cave._\"]\r\n\r\nTom gulped and Roger's eyes widened.\r\n\r\n\"I figured there was only one thing to do,\" continued Astro. \"Use the\r\nblaster, even though it couldn't do much damage. I let her have one\r\nright in the eye!\" Astro shook his head and laughed. \"You should have\r\nseen her pull her head out of that cave! I couldn't sleep for months\r\nafter that. I used to dream that she was sticking her head in my window,\r\nalways getting closer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the blaster do any damage at all?\" asked Sinclair.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Astro. \"I was close enough for the heat charge from\r\nthe muzzle to get her on the side of the head. Nothing fatal, but she's\r\nprobably still out there in the jungle more ugly than ever with half a\r\nface.\"\r\n\r\nThe group fell silent, each thinking of how he would have reacted under\r\nsimilar conditions; each silently thankful that it hadn't happened to\r\nhim. Finally Mrs. Hill rose and said good night, and George excused\r\nhimself to take a last look at the stock. Remembering their early call\r\nfor the next morning, the cadets said good night to Sinclair and retired\r\nto their comfortable rooms. In bed at last, each boy stretched full\r\nlength on his bed and in no time was sound asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark, an hour and a half before the sun would burst over\r\nthe top of the jungle, when Sinclair went to the cadets' room to rouse\r\nthem. He found them already up and dressed in their jungle garb. Each\r\nboy was wearing skin-tight trousers and jerseys made of double strength\r\nspace-suit cloth and colored a dark moldy green. A hunter dressed in\r\nthis manner and standing still could not be seen at twenty paces. The\r\nsnug fit of the suit was protection against thorns and snags that could\r\nfind no hold on the hard, smooth-surfaced material.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearty breakfast the three cadets collected their gear, the\r\nparalo-ray pistols, the shock rifles, and the small shoulder packs of\r\nsynthetic food and camping equipment. Each boy also carried a two-foot\r\njungle knife with a compass inlaid in the handle. A helmet of clear\r\nplastic with a small mesh-covered opening in the face covered each boy's\r\nhead. Dressed as they were, they could walk through the worst part of\r\nthe jungles and not get so much as a scratch.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" commented Sinclair, looking them over, \"I guess you boys have\r\neverything. I'd hate to be the tyranno that crosses your path!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys grinned. \"Thanks for everything, sir,\" said Tom. \"You've been a\r\nlot of help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think nothing of it, Tom. Just bring back a pair of tyranno scalps!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are Mr. and Mrs. Hill?\" asked Astro. \"We'd like to say good-by to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"They left before you got up,\" replied Sinclair. \"They're taking a few\r\ndays off for a visit to Venusport.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys pulled on their jungle boots. Knee-length and paper-thin, they\r\nwere nonetheless unpenetrable even if the boys should step on one of the\r\nneedle-sharp ground thorns.\r\n\r\nThey waved a last good-by to their host, standing on the steps of the\r\nbig house, and moved across the clearing to the edge of the jungle wall.\r\n\r\nAs the cadets approached the thick tangle of vines, the calls and\r\nrustling noises from the many crawling things hidden in the forbidding\r\nthicket slowly died down. They walked along the edge of the tangle of\r\njungle creepers until they found an opening and stepped through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _They were completely surrounded by the jungle_]\r\n\r\nAfter walking only ten feet they were completely surrounded by the\r\njungle and could not even see the clearing they had just left. It was\r\ndark, the network of vines, the thick tree trunks and rank growing\r\nvegetation shutting out the sun, leaving the interior of the jungle\r\nstrangely plunged in gloom. Astro moved ahead, followed by Roger, with\r\nTom bringing up the rear. They followed the path they had entered, as\r\nfar as it went, and then began cutting their way through the underbrush,\r\nstopping only to cut notches in the trees to mark their passage.\r\n\r\nTheir long-bladed knives slicing through vines and brush easily, Tom,\r\nRoger, and Astro hacked their way deeper and deeper into the mysterious\r\nand suffocating green world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's the Sharkey place over there,\" mumbled Major Connel to\r\nhimself, banking his jet launch over the green jungles and pointing the\r\nspeedy little craft's nose toward the clearing in the distance. The\r\nSolar Guard officer wrenched the scout around violently in his approach.\r\nHe was still boiling over the Venusian Delegate's indifference toward\r\nhis mission.\r\n\r\nThe launch skimmed the jungle treetops and glided to a perfect stop near\r\nthe largest of a group of farm buildings. Cutting the motors, Connel sat\r\nand waited for someone to appear. He sat there for ten minutes but no\r\none came out to greet him. Finally he climbed out of the launch and\r\nstood by the hatch, peering intently at the buildings around him, his\r\neyes squinting against the glare of the fiery sun overhead. The\r\nplantation seemed deserted. Reaching back into the launch and pulling\r\nout a paralo-ray gun, he strapped its reassuring bulk to his side and\r\nstepped toward the building that was obviously the main house. Nothing\r\nelse moved in the hot noon sun.\r\n\r\nAs he strode purposefully toward the house, eyes alert for any sign of\r\nlife, he thought for a moment everyone might be taking a midday nap.\r\nMany of the Venusian colonists adapted the age-old custom of the tropics\r\nto escape the intense heat of midday. But he dismissed the thought\r\nimmediately, realizing that his approach in the jet would have awakened\r\nthe deepest of sleepers.\r\n\r\nEntering the house, he stopped in the spacious front hall and called:\r\n\r\n\"Hello! Anybody home? Halloo!\"\r\n\r\nThe only answer was the echo of his own voice, vibrating through the\r\nlarge rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Funny,\" muttered the spaceman. \"Why is this place deserted?\"\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly through the house, opening doors and looking into all\r\nthe rooms, searching the whole place thoroughly before returning to the\r\nclearing. Going to the nearest of the outbuildings, he opened one of the\r\nwide doors and stared into the gloomy interior. With his experienced eye\r\nhe saw immediately that the building had been used to house a large jet\r\ncraft. There was the slightly pungent odor of jet fuel, and on the floor\r\nthe tire marks of a dolly used to roll the craft out to the launching\r\nstrip. He followed the tracks outside and around to the side of the\r\nbuilding where he saw the dolly. It was empty.\r\n\r\nShaking his head grimly, Connel made a quick tour of the remaining\r\nbuildings. They were all deserted but the last one, which seemed to be\r\nbuilt a little more sturdily than the others. Unlike the others, it was\r\nlocked. He looked for a window and discovered that the walls were solid.\r\nThere were no openings except the locked door. He hesitated in front of\r\nthe door, looking down at the ground for a sign of what might have been\r\nstored in the building. The surrounding area revealed no tracks. He\r\npulled out a thick-bladed pocketknife and stepped to the lock, then\r\nsuddenly stopped and grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Great,\" he said to himself. \"A Solar Guard officer about to break into\r\nprivate property without a warrant. Fine thing to have known back at the\r\nAcademy!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly and strode back to the scout. Climbing into the\r\ncraft, he picked up the audioscriber microphone and recorded a brief\r\nmessage. Removing the threadlike tape from the machine, he returned to\r\nthe house and left it on the spool of the audioscribe-replay machine\r\nnear the front door.\r\n\r\nA few moments later the eerie silence of the Sharkey plantation was once\r\nagain shattered by the hissing roar of jets as the launch took off and\r\nclimbed rapidly over the jungle. Air-borne, Connel glanced briefly at a\r\nchart, changed course, and sent the launch hurtling at full speed across\r\nthe jungle toward the Sinclair plantation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"How far do you think we've come?\" asked Tom sleepily.\r\n\r\nAstro yawned and stretched before answering. \"I'd say about fifteen\r\nmiles, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems more like a hundred and fifteen,\" moaned Roger who was sprawled\r\non the ground. \"I ache all over. Start at the top of my head and work\r\ndown, and you won't find one square inch that isn't sore.\"\r\n\r\nTom grinned. He was tired himself, but the three-day march through the\r\njungle had been three of the most exciting days in his life. Coming from\r\na large city where he had to travel two hours by monorail to get to open\r\ngreen country, the curly-haired cadet found this passage through the\r\nwildest jungle in the solar system new and fascinating. He had seen\r\nflowers of every color in the spectrum, some as large as himself; giant\r\nshrubs with leaves so fine that they looked like spider webs; Venusian\r\nteakwood trees fifty to a hundred feet thick at the base with some\r\ntwisted into strange spirals as their trunks, shaded by another larger\r\ntree, sought a clear avenue to the sun. There were bushes that grew\r\nthorns three inches long, hard as steel and thin as needles; jungle\r\ncreepers, vines two and three feet thick, twisting around tree trunks\r\nand strangling them. He saw animals too, all double the size of anything\r\non Earth because of the lighter Venusian gravity; insects the size of\r\nrats, rats the size of dogs, and wild dogs the size of ponies. Up in the\r\ntrees, small anthropoids, cousins to the monkeys of Earth, scampered\r\nfrom limb to limb, screaming at the invaders of their jungle home.\r\nSmooth-furred animals that looked like deer, their horns curling\r\noverhead, scampered about the cadets like puppies, nuzzling them,\r\nnipping at their heels playfully, and barking as though in laughter when\r\nAstro roared at them for getting in the way.\r\n\r\nBut there were dangerous creatures in the jungle too; the beautiful but\r\ndeadly poisonous brush snakes that lurked unseen in the varicolored\r\nfoliage, striking out at anything that passed; animals resembling\r\nchipmunks with enlarged razor-sharp fangs, whose craving for raw meat\r\nwas so great that they would attack an animal ten times its size;\r\nlizards the size of elephants with scales like armor plate that rooted\r\nin swampy ground for their food, but which would attack any intruder,\r\ncharging with amazing speed, their three horns poised; and, finally,\r\nthere were the monsters of Venus--giant beasts whose weights were\r\nmeasured in tons, ruled over by the most horrible of them all--the\r\ntyrannosaurus.\r\n\r\nFights to death between the jungle creatures were common sights for the\r\nboys during their march. They saw a weird soundless fight between a\r\nforty-foot snake and a giant vulture with talons nearly two feet across\r\nand a beak resembling a mammoth nutcracker. The vulture won,\r\nmethodically cutting the reptile's body into sections, its beak slicing\r\nthrough the snake as easily as a knife going through butter.\r\n\r\nMore than once Astro spotted a dangerous creature, and telling Roger and\r\nTom to stand back, he would level his shock rifle and blast it.\r\n\r\nSo far they had seen nothing of their prey--the tyrannosaurus. Tracks\r\naround the steaming swamps were as close as they had come. Once, late in\r\nthe evening of the second day they caught a fleeting glimpse of a\r\nplant-eating brontosaurus lumbering through the brush.\r\n\r\nAll three of the boys had found it difficult to sleep in the jungle. The\r\nfirst two nights they had taken turns at staying on guard and tending\r\nthe campfire. Nothing had bothered them, and on the third night out,\r\nthey decided the fire would be enough to scare off the jungle animals.\r\nIt was risky, but the continual fight through the jungle underbrush had\r\ntired the three boys to the bone and the few hours they stood guard were\r\nsorely missed the next day, so they decided to chance it.\r\n\r\nRoger was already asleep. Astro had just finished checking his rifle to\r\nbe ready for instant fire, when Tom threw the last log on the campfire\r\nand crawled into his sleeping bag.\r\n\r\n\"Think it'll be all right, Astro?\" asked Tom. \"I'm not anxious to wake\r\nup inside one of these critter's stomachs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of them have never seen fire, Tom,\" Astro said reassuringly. \"It\r\nscares them. Besides, we're getting close to the big stuff now. You\r\nmight see a tyranno or a big bronto any time. And if they come along,\r\nyou'll hear 'em, believe me. They're about as quiet as a squadron of\r\ncruisers on battle emergency blasting off from the Academy in the middle\r\nof the night!\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" replied Tom. \"You're the hunter in this crew.\" Suddenly he\r\nlaughed. \"You know I really got a bang out of the way Roger jumped back\r\nfrom that waddling ground bird yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nAstro grinned. \"Yeah, the one thing in this place that's as ferocious as\r\na kitten and he pulls his ray gun like an ancient cowboy!\"\r\n\r\nA very tired voice spoke up from the other sleeping bag. \"Is that so!\r\nWell, when you two brave men came face to face with that baby lizard on\r\na tree root, you were ready to finish your leave in Atom City!\" Roger\r\nunzipped the end of the bag, stuck his blond head out, and gave his unit\r\nmates a sour look. \"Sack in, will you? Your rocket wash is keeping me\r\nawake!\"\r\n\r\nLaughing, Astro and Tom nodded good night to each other and closed their\r\nsleeping bags. The jungle was still, the only movement being the leaping\r\ntongues of flame from the campfire.\r\n\r\nAn hour later it began to rain, a light drizzle at first that increased\r\nuntil it reached the steady pounding of a tropical downpour. Tom awoke\r\nfirst, opening the flap of his sleeping bag only to get his face full of\r\nslimy water that spilled in. Spluttering and coughing he sat up and saw\r\nthat the campfire was out and the campsite was already six inches deep\r\nin water.\r\n\r\n\"Roger, Astro!\" he called and slapped the nearest sleeping bag. Astro\r\nopened the flap a little and peered out sleepily. Instantly he rolled\r\nout of the bag and jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Wake Roger up!\" he snapped. \"We've got to get out of here!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Roger mumbled through the bag, not opening it. \"Why\r\nthe excitement over a little rain?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fire's out, hotshot,\" said Astro. \"It's as dark as the inside of a\r\ncow's number-four belly. We've got to move!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Tom, not understanding the big cadet's sudden nervous\r\nexcitement. \"What's the matter with staying right where we are? Why go\r\ntrooping around in the dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't light a fire anywhere,\" added Roger, finally sticking his head\r\nout of his sleeping bag.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to get on high ground!\" said Astro, hurriedly packing the\r\ncamping equipment. \"We're in a hollow here. The rain really comes down\r\non Venus, and in another hour this place will be a pond!\"\r\n\r\nSensing the urgency in Astro's voice, Roger began packing up his\r\nequipment and in a few moments the three boys had their gear slung over\r\ntheir shoulders and were slogging through water already knee-deep.\r\n\r\n\"I still don't see why we have to go tracking through the jungle in the\r\nmiddle of the night,\" grumbled Roger. \"We could climb up a tree and wait\r\nout the storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd have to wait long after the rain stops,\" replied Astro. \"There is\r\none thing in this place nothing ever gets enough of, and that's water.\r\nAnimals know it and hang around all the water holes. If a small animal\r\ntries to get a drink, he more than likely winds up in something's\r\nstomach. When it rains like this, hollows fill up like the one we just\r\nleft, and everything within running, hopping, and crawling distance\r\nheads for it to get a bellyful of water. In another hour our camp will\r\nbe like something out of a nightmare, with every animal in the jungle\r\ncoming down for a drink and starting to fight one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if we stayed there--\" Roger stopped.\r\n\r\n\"We'd be in the middle of it,\" said Astro grimly. \"We wouldn't last two\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nWalking single file, with Astro in the lead, followed by Roger and then\r\nTom, they stumbled through the pitch-black darkness. Astro refused to\r\nshine a light, for fear of being attacked by a desperate animal, more\r\neager for water than afraid of the light. They carried their shock\r\nblasters cocked and ready to fire. The rain continued, increasing in\r\nfury until they were enveloped in a nearly solid wall of water. In a\r\nlittle while the floor of the jungle became one continuous mudhole, with\r\neach step taking them ankle-deep into the sucking mud. Their climb was\r\nuphill, and the water from above increased, washing down around them in\r\ntorrents. More than once one of the cadets fell, gasping for breath,\r\ninto the dirty water, only to be jerked back to more solid footing by\r\nthe other two. Stumbling, their hands groping wildly in the dark, they\r\npushed forward.\r\n\r\nThey were reaching higher ground when Astro stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" he whispered hoarsely.\r\n\r\nThe boys stood still, the rain pounding down on their plastic headgear,\r\nholding rifles ready and straining their ears for some sound other than\r\nthe drumming of rain.\r\n\r\n\"I don't hear anything,\" said Roger.\r\n\r\n\"_Shhh!_\" hissed Astro.\r\n\r\nThey waited, and then from a distance they heard the faint crashing of\r\nunderbrush. Gradually it became more distinct until there was no\r\nmistaking its source. A large monster was moving through the jungle near\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Tom, trying to keep his voice calm.\r\n\r\n\"A big one,\" said Astro. \"A real big one. And I think it's heading this\r\nway!\"\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" gasped Roger. \"What do we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We either run, or stay here and try to blast it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you say, Astro,\" said Roger. \"You're the boss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same here,\" said Tom. \"Call it.\"\r\n\r\nAstro did not answer right away. He strained his ears, listening to the\r\nmovements of the advancing monster, trying to ascertain the exact\r\ndirection the beast was taking. The noise became more violent, the\r\ncrashing more sharply defined as small trees were crushed to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"If only I knew exactly what it is!\" said Astro desperately. \"If it's a\r\ntyranno, it walks on its hind legs and has its head way up in the trees,\r\nand could pass within ten feet of us and not see us. But if it's a\r\nbronto, it has a long snakelike neck that he pokes all around and he\r\nwouldn't miss us at a hundred feet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Make up your mind quick, big boy,\" said Roger. \"If that thing gets any\r\ncloser, I'm opening up with this blaster. He might eat me, but I'll sure\r\nmake his teeth rattle first!\"\r\n\r\nThe ground began to shake as the approaching monster came nearer. Astro\r\nremained still, ears straining for some sound to indicate exactly what\r\nwas crashing down on them.\r\n\r\nAbove them, the shrill scream of an anthropoid suddenly pierced the dark\r\nnight as its tree home was sent crashing to the ground. There was a\r\ngrowing roar and the crashing stopped momentarily.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" said Astro tensely. \"That's a tyranno, but he's\r\ndown on all fours now, looking for that monkey! Keep together and make\r\nas little noise as you can. No talking. Keep your blasters and emergency\r\nlights ready. If he discovers us, you shine the light on his face Roger,\r\nand Tom and I will shoot. O.K.?\"\r\n\r\nTom and Roger agreed.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Astro, \"let's go--and spaceman's luck!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, Officer?\"\r\n\r\nConnel heaved his bulk out of the jet launch and looked hard at the man\r\nstanding in front of him. \"You Rex Sinclair?\"\r\n\r\nSinclair nodded. \"That's right.\"\r\n\r\nConnel offered his hand. \"Major Connel, Solar Guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad to meet you,\" replied the planter, gripping the spaceman's hand.\r\n\"Have something to cool you off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Connel. \"I can use it. Whew! Must be at least one twenty\r\nin the shade.\"\r\n\r\nSinclair chuckled. \"This way, Major.\"\r\n\r\nThey didn't say anything more until Connel was resting comfortably in a\r\ndeep chair, admiring the crystal roof of Sinclair's house. After a\r\npleasant exchange about crops and problems of farming on Venus, the\r\ngruff spaceman squared his back and stared straight at his host. \"Mr.\r\nJames, the Solar Delegate, told me you've resisted pressure to join the\r\nVenusian Nationalists.\"\r\n\r\nSinclair's expression changed slightly. His eyebrows lifting\r\nquizzically. \"Why--yes, that's true.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like you to tell me what you know about the organization.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" mused Sinclair. \"Is that an order?\" he added, chuckling.\r\n\r\n\"That's a request. I'd like to learn as much about the Nationalists as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\"\r\n\r\nConnel paused and then said casually, \"A spot check. The Solar Guard\r\nlikes to keep its eyes open for trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trouble?\" exclaimed Sinclair. \"You're not serious!\"\r\n\r\nConnel nodded his head. \"It's probably nothing but a club. However, I'd\r\nlike to get some facts on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you spoken to anyone else?\" asked Sinclair.\r\n\r\n\"I just came from the Sharkey plantation. It's deserted. Not a soul\r\naround. I'll drop back by there before I return to Venusport.\" Connel\r\npaused and looked squarely at Sinclair. \"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know much about them, Major,\" replied the planter. \"It always\r\nseemed to me nothing more than a group of planters getting together--\"\r\n\r\nConnel cut him off. \"Possibly, but why didn't you join?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't all your friends in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I just don't have time. I have a big place, and there's only\r\nme and my foreman and housekeeper now. All the field hands left some\r\ntime ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where'd they go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Venusport, I guess. Can't get people to farm these days.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mr. Sinclair,\" declared Connel, \"let's lay our cards on the\r\ntable. I know how you must feel talking about your friends, but this is\r\nreally important. Vitally important to every citizen in the Solar\r\nAlliance. Suppose the Nationalists were really a tight organization with\r\na purpose--a purpose of making Venus independent of the Solar Alliance.\r\nIf they succeeded, if Venus did break away, Mercury might follow, then\r\nMars--the whole system fall apart--break up into independent states. And\r\nwhen that happens, there's trouble--customs barriers, jealousies,\r\nindividual armies and navies, and then, ultimately, a space war. It's\r\nmore than just friendship, Sinclair, it's the smallest crack in the\r\nsolid front of the Solar Alliance, but it's a crack that _can_ be opened\r\nfurther if we don't stop it now.\"\r\n\r\nSinclair was impressed. \"Very well, Major, I'll tell you everything I\r\nknow about them. And you're right, it is hard to talk about your\r\nfriends. I've grown up here in the Venusian jungle. I helped my father\r\nclear this land where the house is built. Most of the men in the\r\nNationalists are friends of mine, but\"--he sighed--\"you're right, I\r\ncan't allow this to happen to the Solar Alliance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow what to happen?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"Just what you said, about Venus becoming an independent state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all you know,\" said Connel.\r\n\r\n\"The group began to form about three years ago. Al Sharkey came over\r\nhere one night and said a group of the planters were getting together\r\nevery so often to exchange information about crops and farming\r\nconditions. I went a few times, we all did, on this part of Venus. At\r\nfirst it was fun. We even had picnics and barn dances every three or\r\nfour weeks. Then one night someone suggested we come dressed in old\r\ncostumes--the type worn by our forefathers who founded Venus.\"\r\n\r\nConnel nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Well, one thing led to another,\" continued Sinclair. \"They started\r\ntalking about the great history of our planet, and complaining about\r\npaying taxes to support the Solar Alliance. Instead of opening up new\r\ncolonies like the one out on Pluto, we should develop our own planet.\r\nWe stopped dancing, the women stopped coming, and then one night we\r\nelected a president. Al Sharkey. The first thing he did was order all\r\nmembers to attend meetings in the dress of our forefathers. He gave the\r\norganization a name, the Venusian Nationalists. Right after that, I\r\nstopped going. I got tired of listening to speeches about the wonderful\r\nplanet we live on, and how terrible it was to be governed by men on\r\nEarth, millions of miles away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't they consider that they had equal representation in the Solar\r\nAlliance Chamber?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"No, Major. There wasn't anything you could say to any of them. If you\r\ntried to reason with them, they called you a--a--\" Sinclair stopped and\r\nturned away.\r\n\r\n\"What did they call you?\" demanded Connel, getting madder by the minute.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone that disagreed with them was called an Earthling.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you disagreed?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"I quit,\" said Sinclair stoutly. \"And right after that, I started losing\r\nlivestock. I found them dead in the pens, poisoned. And some of my crops\r\nwere burned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you protest to the Solar Guard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, but there wasn't any proof any one of my neighbors had done\r\nit. They don't bother me any more, but they don't speak to me either.\r\nIt's as though I had a horrible disease. There hasn't been a guest in\r\nthis house in nearly two years. Three space cadets are the first\r\nvisitors here since I quit the organization.\"\r\n\r\n\"Space Cadets?\" Connel looked at the planter quizzically.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, nice young chaps. Corbett, Manning, and a big fellow named Astro.\r\nThey're out in the jungle now hunting for tyrannosaurus. I met them\r\nthrough a friend in Venusport and invited them to use my house as a base\r\nof operations. Do you know them?\"\r\n\r\nConnel nodded. \"Very well. Finest cadet unit at the Academy. How long\r\nhave they been in the jungle?\"\r\n\r\n\"About four and a half days now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hope they get themselves a tyranno. But at the same time\"--Connel\r\ncouldn't help chuckling--\"if they do, Space Academy will never hear the\r\nend of it!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the hot wilting silence around the house was shattered by a\r\nthunderous roar. Connel jumped up, followed Sinclair to the window, and\r\nstared out over the clearing. They saw what appeared to be a\r\nwell-organized squadron of jet boats come in for a landing with near\r\nmilitary precision. The doors opened quickly and men poured out onto the\r\ndusty field. They were dressed alike in coveralls with short\r\nquarter-length space boots and round plastic crash helmets. Each man\r\ncarried a paralo-ray gun strapped to his hips. The uniforms were a\r\nbrilliant green, with a white band across the chest. The men formed\r\nranks, waited for a command from a man dressed in darker green, and then\r\nmarched up toward the house.\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" roared Connel. \"Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Nationalists!\" cried Sinclair. \"They threatened to burn down my\r\nhouse and destroy my farm if I wrote that letter to the delegate.\r\nThey've come to carry out their threat!\"\r\n\r\nConnel pulled the paralo-ray gun from his hip and gripped it firmly. \"Do\r\nyou want those men in your house?\" he asked Sinclair.\r\n\r\n\"No--no, of course not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have Solar Guard protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"How--?\" Sinclair asked. \"There are no Solar Guardsmen around here!\"\r\n\r\n\"What in blazes do you think I am, man!\" roared Connel as he lunged for\r\nthe door and stepped out onto the porch. The men were within a hundred\r\nfeet of the porch when they saw Connel. The Solar Guard officer spread\r\nhis legs and stuck out his jaw, his paralo-ray gun leveled. \"The first\r\none of you tin soldiers that puts a foot on these steps gets frozen\r\nstiffer than a snowball on Pluto! Now stand where you are, state your\r\nbusiness, and then _blast off_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" The leader of the column of men held up his hand. Connel saw\r\nthat the plastic helmets were frosted over, except for a clear band\r\nacross the eye level. All of the faces were hidden. The leader stepped\r\nforward, his hand on his paralo-ray gun. \"Greetings, Major Connel.\"\r\n\r\nConnel snorted. \"If you'd take off that Halloween mask, I might know who\r\nI'm talking to!\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Hilmarc.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hilmarc?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I am the leader of this detachment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leader, huh?\" grunted Connel. \"Leader of what? A bunch of little tin\r\nsoldiers?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see, Major.\" Hilmarc's voice was low and threatening.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to count to five,\" announced Connel grimly, lifting his\r\nparalo-ray gun, \"and if you and your playmates aren't back in your\r\nships, I start blasting.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be unwise,\" replied Hilmarc. \"Your one gun against all of\r\nours.\"\r\n\r\nConnel grinned. \"I know. It's going to be a whale of a fight, isn't it?\"\r\nThen, without pause, he shouted, \"_One--two--three--four--five!_\"\r\n\r\nHe opened fire, squeezing the trigger rapidly. The first row of\r\ngreen-clad men were immediately frozen. Dropping to one knee, the\r\nspaceman again opened fire, and men in the second row stiffened as they\r\ntried to return the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Fire! Cut him down!\" roared Hilmarc frantically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe men broke ranks and the area in front of Sinclair's house crackled\r\nwith paralo-ray gunfire. Darting behind a chair, Connel dropped to the\r\nfloor, his gun growing hot under the continuous discharge of paralyzing\r\nenergy. In a matter of moments the Solar Guard officer had frozen nearly\r\nhalf of the attacking troop, their bodies scattered in various\r\npositions. Suddenly his gun spit fire and began to smoke. The energy\r\ncharge was exhausted. Connel jumped to his feet and snapped to\r\nattention. He knew from experience that if being hit was inevitable, the\r\nbest way to receive the charge was by standing at attention, taking the\r\nstrain off the heart. He faced the clearing and a dozen shots of\r\nparalyzing energy hit him simultaneously. He became rigid and the short\r\nfurious battle was over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne of the green-clad men released Hilmarc from the effects of Connel's\r\nninth shot and he stepped forward to stare straight into Connel's eyes.\r\n\"I know you can hear me, Major. I want to compliment you on your\r\nshooting. But your brave resistance now is as futile as the resistance\r\nof the entire Solar Guard in the near future.\" Hilmarc smiled\r\narrogantly and stepped back. \"Now, if you'll excuse me, I will attend to\r\nthe business I came here for--to take care of a weakling and an\r\ninformer!\" He turned and shouted to his men. \"You have your orders! Get\r\nSinclair and then burn everything in sight.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Astro, Tom,\" gasped Roger. \"I--I can't go on.\"\r\n\r\nThe blond-haired cadet fell headlong to the ground, almost burying\r\nhimself in the mud. Tom and Astro turned without a word, and gripping\r\nRoger under each arm, helped him to his feet. Behind them, the thunder\r\nof the stalking tyrannosaurus came closer, and they forced themselves to\r\ngreater effort. For two days they had been running before the monster.\r\nIt was a wild flight through a wild jungle that offered them little\r\nprotection. And while their fears were centered on the brute behind\r\nthem, their sleepy, weary eyes sought out other dangers that lay ahead.\r\nMore than once they stopped to blast a hungry, frightened beast that\r\nbarred their path, leaving it for the tyrannosaurus and giving\r\nthemselves a momentary respite in their flight.\r\n\r\nAstro led the way, tirelessly slashing at the vines and creepers with\r\nhis jungle knife, opening the path for Roger and Tom. The Venusian cadet\r\nwas sure that they were near the clearing around the Sinclair\r\nplantation. Since early morning he had seen the trail markers they had\r\nleft when they started into the jungle. The cadets knew that if they\r\ndidn't reach the clearing soon they would have to stand and fight the\r\nterrible thing that trailed them. During the first wild night, they had\r\nstumbled into a sinkhole, and as Tom wallowed helplessly in the\r\nclinging, suffocating mud, Astro and Roger stood and fought the giant\r\nbeast. The shock rifles cracked against the armorlike hide of the\r\nmonster, momentarily stunning him, but in the darkness and rain, they\r\nwere unable to get a clear head shot. When Tom finally pulled himself\r\nout of the mudhole, they struggled onward through the jungle, with only\r\none shot left in each blaster.\r\n\r\n\"How much farther, Astro?\" asked Tom, his voice weak with fatigue. \"I'm\r\nstarting to fold too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not too far now, Tom,\" the big cadet assured him. \"We should be hitting\r\nthe clearing soon now.\" He turned and looked back. \"If we could only get\r\na clear shot at that brute's head!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang on, Roger,\" said Tom. \"Just a little more now.\"\r\n\r\nRoger didn't answer, merely bobbing his head in acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nBehind them, the crashing thunderous steps seemed to be getting closer\r\nand Astro drove himself harder, slashing at the vines and tangled\r\nunderbrush, sometimes just bursting through by sheer driving strength.\r\nBut the heavy-footed creature still stalked them ponderously.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Astro stopped and sniffed the air. \"Smoke!\" he cried. \"We're\r\nalmost there!\"\r\n\r\nTom and Roger smiled wanly and they pushed on. A moment later the giant\r\ncadet pointed through the underbrush. \"There! I see the clearing!\r\nAnd--by the stars--there's a fire! The house is burning!\"\r\n\r\nForgetting the danger behind them, the three boys raced toward the\r\nclearing. Just before they emerged from the jungle, they stopped and\r\nstood openmouthed with astonishment, staring at the scene before them.\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" gasped Astro. \"Look!\"\r\n\r\nThe outbuildings of the plantation were burning furiously, sending up\r\nthick columns of smoke. The wind blew the dense fumes toward them and\r\nthey began to cough and gag. Through the smoke they saw a strange array\r\nof jet craft in the clearing. Then suddenly their attention was jerked\r\nback to another danger. The tyrannosaurus was nearly upon them.\r\n\r\n\"Run!\" roared Astro. He broke for the clearing, followed by Roger and\r\nTom. Once in the open, the boys ran several hundred yards to the nearest\r\njet craft, and safely in the hatch, turned to see the monster come to\r\nthe edge of the clearing and stop. They saw the brute clearly for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\nIt stood up on its hind legs, standing almost a hundred feet high. It\r\nmoved its flat, triangular-shaped head in a slow arc, peering out over\r\nthe clearing. The smoke billowed around it. It snorted several times in\r\nfear and anger. Astro looked at it, wide-eyed, and finally spoke in awed\r\ntones. \"By the rings of Saturn, it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is what?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"The same tyranno I blasted when I was a kid, the one that trapped me in\r\nthe cave!\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" snorted Roger. \"How can you tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"There on the head, the scars--and that eye. That's the mark of a\r\nblaster!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be a rocket-headed Earthworm!\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nThe smoke thickened at the moment, and when it cleared again, the great\r\nbeast was gone. \"I guess the smoke chased him away,\" said Astro.\r\n\"Smoke!\" He whirled around. With the threat of the tyrannosaurus gone,\r\nthey could face the strange happenings around the clearing.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said Tom. He started for the burning buildings in back of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment a group of the green-clad men came around the side\r\nof the house. Astro grabbed Tom by the arm and pulled him back.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on here? All these ships, buildings burning, and those men\r\ndressed in green. What is it?\"\r\n\r\nThe three boys huddled behind the jet and studied the scene.\r\n\r\n\"I don't get it,\" said Tom. \"Who are those men? They almost look as if\r\nthey're soldiers of some kind, but I don't recognize the uniform.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's the fire department,\" suggested Roger.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" roared Tom suddenly. \"There on the porch! Major\r\nConnel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Omigosh!\" said Astro. \"It is, but what's the matter with him? Why is he\r\nstanding there like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's been paralo-rayed!\" exclaimed Roger. \"See how still he is!\r\nWhatever these jokers in uniforms are, they're not friendly!\" He raised\r\nhis shock rifle. \"This last shot in my blaster should--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, Roger,\" said Tom, \"don't go off half-cocked. We can't do\r\nmuch with just three shots. We'd better take over one of these ships.\r\nThere must be guns aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Astro. \"How about that big one over there?\" He pointed to\r\nthe largest of the assembled crafts.\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" said Tom. \"Sneak around this side and make a dash for it.\"\r\n\r\nGripping their rifles, they slipped around the stern of the small ship,\r\nand keeping a wary eye on the milling men around the front of the\r\nbuilding, they dashed toward the bigger ship.\r\n\r\nOn the porch of the main house, Major Connel, every muscle in his body\r\nparalyzed, saw the three cadets dart across the field and his heart\r\nskipped a beat. Immediately before him, two of the green-clad men were\r\nholding Sinclair while Hilmarc addressed him arrogantly.\r\n\r\n\"This is just the beginning, Sinclair. Don't try to cross us again.\r\nNeither you nor anyone else can stop us!\" He whirled around and faced\r\nConnel. \"And as for you and your Solar Guard, Major Connel, you can\r\ntell them--\"\r\n\r\nHilmarc's tirade was suddenly interrupted by a shrill whistle and the\r\nglare of a red flare overhead. There was a chorus of shouts as the men\r\nducked for cover.\r\n\r\nA voice, Connel recognized as Tom's, boomed out over the loud-speaker of\r\nthe large jet ship near the edge of the clearing. \"Now hear this! You\r\nare covered by an atomic mortar. Drop your guns and raise your hands!\"\r\n\r\nThe men stared at the ship, confused, but Hilmarc issued a curt command.\r\n\"Return to the ships!\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but he'll blast us,\" whined one of the men. \"He'll kill us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fool!\" roared Hilmarc. \"It must be a friend of Connel's or\r\nSinclair's. He won't dare fire an atomic shell near this house, for fear\r\nof killing his friends! Now get aboard your ships and blast off!\"\r\n\r\nFrom their ship, Tom, Roger, and Astro saw the men scatter across the\r\nfield, and realizing their bluff had failed, they opened fire with the\r\nparalo-ray guns. But their range was too far. In a few moments the\r\nclearing around the Sinclair home was alive with the coughing roar of\r\nthe jets blasting off.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone, Sinclair snatched up an abandoned ray gun\r\nand released the major from the charge. Connel immediately jumped for\r\nanother gun. But then, as the jets started to take off, he saw that it\r\nwould be useless to pursue the invaders. Thankful that the cadets had\r\narrived in time, he trotted across the clearing to meet them as they\r\nclimbed wearily from the remaining jet ship.\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" he roared good-naturedly, \"you three\r\nspace-brained idiots had me scared! I thought you would really let go\r\nwith that mortar!\"\r\n\r\nTom and Roger grinned, relieved to find the spaceman unhurt, while\r\nAstro looked off at the disappearing fleet of ships.\r\n\r\n\"What's happened, sir?\" asked Tom. \"What's it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't time to explain now,\" said Connel. \"I just want you three to\r\nknow you got back here in time to save the rest of this man's property.\"\r\nHe turned toward Sinclair, who was just approaching. \"Did you recognize\r\nany of them?\" he asked the planter.\r\n\r\nSinclair shook his head. \"I thought I did--by their voices, I mean. But\r\nI couldn't see anyone through that frosted headgear they were wearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they left a ship. We'll find out who that belongs to,\" said\r\nConnel. \"All right, Corbett, Manning, Astro. Stand by to blast off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blast off?\" exclaimed Roger. \"But we're on leave, sir!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Not any more, you're not!\" snapped Connel. \"You're recalled as of now!\r\nGet this ship ready to blast off for Venusport in five minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure they went south, Astro?\"\r\n\r\nMajor Connel was examining a map of the Southern Hemisphere of Venus.\r\nThe three cadets were grouped around him in the small control room of\r\nthe jet ship.\r\n\r\n\"I think so, sir,\" replied Astro. \"I watched them circle and then climb.\r\nThere would be no reason to climb unless they were going over the\r\nmountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, Tom?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir. The map doesn't show anything but jungle for about a\r\nthousand square miles. Unless there's a secret base somewhere between\r\nhere and there\"--he placed his fingers on the map where the Sharkey and\r\nSinclair plantations were marked--\"I don't see where they could have\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that must be the answer, then,\" sighed the gruff spaceman. \"Our\r\nalert to the patrol ships in this area narrows it down. Nothing was\r\nspotted in the air. And they couldn't have blasted off into space. All\r\ntheir ships were low-flying stuff.\"\r\n\r\nBlasting off from the Sinclair plantation immediately, the three cadets\r\nand the major had hoped to find the operations base of the green-clad\r\ninvaders, but the ships had disappeared. The ship they had captured\r\nproved to be a freighter with no name and all identifying marks removed.\r\nThey had asked the Solar Guard ship registry in Venusport to check on\r\nthe vessel's title but so far had received no answer.\r\n\r\nNow blasting back to Venusport at full speed, Connel told the boys the\r\nreal nature of his mission to Venus. The boys were shocked, unable to\r\nbelieve that anyone, or any group of persons, would dare to buck the\r\nauthority of the Solar Guard. Yet they had seen with their own eyes a\r\ndemonstration of the strength of the Nationalists. Roger had sent a\r\ntop-secret teleceiver message to Commander Walters at Space Academy,\r\nrequesting an immediate conference with Connel, and had received\r\nconfirmation within a half-hour.\r\n\r\n\"I think Captain Strong will be along too,\" said Roger to Tom after\r\nConnel had retired to a compartment with a recorder to transcribe a\r\nreport of the affair at Sinclair's. \"The message said we were to prepare\r\na full report for consideration by Commander Walters, Professor Sykes,\r\nand Captain Strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy,\" said the curly-haired cadet, \"this thing is too big for me to\r\nswallow. Imagine a bunch of dopes dressing up in uniforms and burning a\r\nguy's buildings because he wrote a letter to his delegate!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd hate to be a member of that organization when Commander Walters\r\ngets through with them,\" said Roger in a slow drawl. \"And particularly\r\nthe guy that ordered Connel blasted with that ray gun. Ten shots at\r\nonce! Wow! That guy must have nerves made of steel!\"\r\n\r\nWithin an hour the jet freighter was circling Venusport and was given\r\npriority clearance for an immediate landing. Immediately upon landing,\r\nthe ship swarmed with Solar Guardsmen, grim-faced men assigned to guard\r\nit, while technicians checked the ship for identification. The three\r\nboys were still wearing the jungle garb when they presented themselves\r\nto Major Connel with the request for a little sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Take an aspirin!\" roared Connel. \"We've got important work to do!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir,\" said Roger, his eyes half-closed, \"we're dead on our feet!\r\nWe've been out in the jungle for three days and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Manning,\" interrupted the spaceman, \"everything you saw during that\r\nbusiness back at Sinclair's might be valuable. I'm sorry, but I'll have\r\nto insist that you talk to the Solar Guard security officers first. As\r\ntired as you are, you might forget something after a heavy sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThere was little else the boys could do but follow the burly officer out\r\nof the ship to a well-guarded jet cab which took them through the\r\nstreets of Venusport to the Solar Guard headquarters.\r\n\r\nThey rode the elevator to the conference room in silence, each boy\r\nfeeling at any moment that he would collapse from exhaustion. In the\r\nlong corridor they passed tough-looking enlisted guardsmen who were\r\nheavily armed, and before being allowed into the conference room, they\r\nwere scrutinized by a burly officer. Finally inside, they were allowed\r\nto sit down in soft chairs and were given hot cups of tea to drink while\r\nprecise, careful interrogators took down the story of their first\r\nmeeting with the Venusian Nationalists. They were forced to repeat\r\ndetails many times, in the hope that something new might be added.\r\nGroggy after nearly two hours of this, the boys felt sure that the time\r\nhad come for them to be allowed to get some sleep, but after the last\r\nquestion from the interrogators, they were ushered into the presence of\r\nCommander Walters, Major Connel, Professor Sykes, Captain Strong, and\r\nseveral recording secretaries. Before the conference began, Delegate E.\r\nPhilips James arrived with his personal secretary. He offered his\r\nexcuses for being late and took his place at the long table. Tom shot a\r\nglance at the secretary. The man looked vaguely familiar to him. The\r\ncadet tried to place him, but he was so tired that he could not think.\r\n\r\n\"Major Connel,\" began Commander Walters abruptly, \"what do you consider\r\nthe best possible move for the Solar Guard to make? Under the present\r\ncircumstances, do you think we should undertake a full-scale\r\ninvestigation? We talked to Al Sharkey, and while he admits being head\r\nof an organization known as the Venusian Nationalists, he denies any\r\nknowledge of any attack on Sinclair such as you describe. And he claims\r\nto have been in Venusport when the incident happened.\"\r\n\r\nConnel thought a moment. \"I don't know about Sharkey, but I don't think\r\na public investigation should be made yet. I think it would arouse a lot\r\nof speculation and achieve no results.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think we should move against them merely on the basis of this\r\nencounter at the Sinclair plantation,\" asked E. Philips James in his\r\nsmoothest manner.\r\n\r\nConnel shook his head. \"I think our best bet is to locate their base. If\r\nwe can nail them with solid evidence, we'll have a good case to present\r\nbefore the Grand Council of the Solar Alliance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, Major.\" James smiled. Behind him, his secretary was\r\nbusy transcribing the conversational exchange on his audioscriber.\r\n\r\n\"What would you require to locate the base?\" asked Walters.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't worked out the details yet,\" said Connel, \"but a small\r\nexpedition into the jungle would be better than sending a regiment of\r\nguardsmen, or a fleet of ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any idea where the base might be?\" Sykes suddenly spoke up.\r\n\"Most of those men were supposed to be planters who know the jungle\r\nwell. Isn't it possible that they might have their base well hidden and\r\na small party, such as you suggest, could cover too little ground?\"\r\n\r\nConnel turned to Astro. \"Astro, do you know that section of the belt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Astro. \"I hunted all over that area when I was a\r\nboy.\" The big cadet went on to explain how he had become so familiar\r\nwith the jungle, and described briefly their experience with the\r\ntyrannosaurus. All of the men at the table were impressed by his\r\nknowledge of jungle lore.\r\n\r\n\"I gather you plan to take these cadets on your expedition, Major,\"\r\ncommented James.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do. They work well together and have already been in the\r\njungle,\" answered Connel.\r\n\r\n\"What do you three boys think of the idea?\" asked Walters. \"I don't have\r\nto remind you that you'll be up against two kinds of danger: the jungle\r\nitself, and the Nationalists.\"\r\n\r\n\"We understand, sir,\" replied Tom, without even waiting for his unit\r\nmates' quick nods.\r\n\r\n\"There's another factor,\" Captain Strong broke in. \"You'll be giving up\r\nyour leave. There won't be any extra time off. Should this mission be\r\ncompleted before the next term at the Academy begins, fine. But if not,\r\nyou'll have to return to work immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"We understand that too, sir,\" said Tom. \"We're willing to do anything\r\nwe can. And if I might offer a personal opinion\"--he glanced at Astro\r\nand Roger--\"I think the _Polaris_ unit appreciates the seriousness of\r\nthe situation and we agree with the major. A small party, especially\r\nours, since we're already established as hunters, would be less suspect\r\nthan a larger one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we all agree that the _Polaris_ unit is qualified for the\r\nmission, Corbett,\" said Walters, who saw through Tom's eagerness to be\r\nassigned to go with the major.\r\n\r\nThe meeting broke up soon afterward. Connel remained with Strong and\r\nWalters to work out the details of the mission and to draft a top-secret\r\nreport to the Grand Council of the Solar Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe three weary cadets were quartered in the finest hotel in Venusport\r\nand had just stumbled into bed when the room teleceiver signal buzzed.\r\nTom shuffled over to the screen near the table where the remains of a\r\nhuge supper gave mute evidence of their hunger. Switching on the\r\nmachine, he saw Strong's face come into focus.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you boys aren't too comfortable,\" announced Strong. \"I'm afraid\r\nthe sleep you're so hungry for will have to wait. This is an emergency!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" groaned Roger. \"I can't understand why emergencies come up\r\nevery time I try to pound the pillow!\"\r\n\r\nAstro fell back onto his bed with the look of a martyred saint and\r\ngroaned.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, sir?\" asked Tom, who was as tired as the others.\r\nNonetheless he felt the urgency in Strong's voice.\r\n\r\n\"You blast off in half an hour,\" said the Solar Guard captain. \"The\r\n_Polaris_ has been refitted and you're to check her over before\r\nreturning to Sinclair's. Everything has been prepared for you. Get\r\ndressed and you'll find a jet cab waiting for you in front of the hotel.\r\nI had hoped to see you again before you left, but I've been ordered\r\nback to the Academy with Commander Walters. We've got to report to the\r\nSolar Council, personally.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K., sir,\" said Tom, then smiled and added, \"We're sorry your fishing\r\nwas interrupted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't catching anything, anyway.\" Strong laughed. \"I've got to go.\r\nSee you back at the Academy. Spaceman's luck!\"\r\n\r\n\"Same to you, sir,\" replied Tom. The screen blurred and the image faded\r\nas the connection was broken. Tom turned to face his sleepy-eyed unit\r\nmates. \"Well, I guess we'd better take another aspirin. It looks like a\r\nhard night!\"\r\n\r\nHastily donning fresh jungle gear supplied the night before in\r\nanticipation of the mission, the three cadets trouped wearily out of\r\ntheir rooms and rode down to the lobby in the vacuum elevator. They\r\nwalked across the deserted lobby as though in a trance and outside to\r\nthe quiet street. A jet cab stood at the curb, the driver watching them.\r\nHe whistled sharply and waved at them. \"Hey, cadets! Over here!\"\r\n\r\nStill in a fog, the three cadets climbed into the back seat, flopping\r\ninto the soft cushions with audible groans as the cab shot away from the\r\nhotel and sped into the main highway which led to the spaceport.\r\n\r\nThe traffic was light and the cab zoomed along at a smooth, fast clip,\r\nlulling the boys into a fitful doze. But they were rudely awakened when\r\nthe car spun into a small country lane and the driver slammed on the\r\nbrakes. He whirled around and grinned at them over a paralo-ray pistol.\r\n\"Sorry, boys, the ride ends here. Now climb out and start stripping.\"\r\n\r\nThe three sleepy cadets came alive instantly. Without a word they moved\r\nin three different directions simultaneously. Tom dived for one door,\r\nAstro the other, while Roger flopped to the floor. The driver fired,\r\nmissing all of them, and before he could fire again he was jerked out\r\nof his seat and held in a viselike grip by Astro. Tom quickly wrenched\r\nthe paralo-ray gun from his hand.\r\n\r\n\"All right, you little space crawler,\" growled Astro, \"start talking!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy, Astro,\" said Tom. \"How do you expect him to talk when\r\nyou've got him around the Adam's apple!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, you big ape,\" said Roger in a slow drawl. \"Find out what he has\r\nto say before you twist his head off!\"\r\n\r\nAstro released the man, pushing him against the cab door and pinning him\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's have it,\" he growled. \"What's this all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean any harm,\" whined the cab driver. \"A guy calls me and\r\nsays for me to meet three Space Cadets.\"\r\n\r\n\"What guy?\" snapped Tom.\r\n\r\n\"A guy I once knew when I was working the fields in the jungle belt. I\r\nworked on a plantation as a digger.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's his name?\" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know his name. He's just a guy. He calls me and says it's worth\r\na hundred credits to pick up three Space Cadets from the hotel and hold\r\n'em for an hour. I figured the best way to hold you would be to make you\r\ntake your clothes off.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he look like?\" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n\"A little guy, with a bald head and a limp. That's all I know--honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"A limp, eh?\" asked Tom. \"A little fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"How little?\" asked Astro, getting the drift of Tom's question.\r\n\r\n\"Real little. About five feet maybe, not much more'n that!\"\r\n\r\nThe three boys looked at each other and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"The guy we bought our jungle gear from in the pawnshop!\" exclaimed\r\nAstro.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Tom. \"It sure sounds like him. But why would he want to\r\nstop us? And more important, who told him that Captain Strong was\r\nsending a cab for us?\"\r\n\r\nThey turned back to the cab driver for further explanation, but the man\r\nwas now actually crying with fright.\r\n\r\n\"We won't get anything more out of this little creep,\" said Astro.\r\n\"Let's just turn him over to the Solar Guard at the spaceport. They'll\r\nknow how to handle him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Tom agreed. \"We've lost enough time as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no--please!\" moaned the cabman. \"Lemme go! Take the cab. Drive it\r\nto the spaceport and just leave it, but please don't turn me over to\r\nthe Solar Guard. If I'm seen with them, I'll be--\" Suddenly the man\r\ndarted to one side, eluded Astro's lunge, and scampered away. In a\r\nmoment he was swallowed up in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Boy,\" breathed Astro, \"he was sure scared of something!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tom. \"And I'm beginning to get a little scared myself!\"\r\n\r\nThe cadets climbed into the cab and roared off toward the spaceport,\r\neach boy with the feeling that he was sitting on a smoldering volcano\r\nthat was suddenly starting to erupt around him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to Solar Guard Venusport! Request emergency\r\nrelay circuit to Commander Walters en route Earth!\"\r\n\r\nOn the radar bridge of the _Polaris_, Roger Manning spoke quickly into\r\nthe teleceiver microphone. Just a few minutes before the giant spaceship\r\nhad blasted off from Venusport, heading for the Sinclair plantation,\r\nMajor Connel had ordered Roger to get in touch with Walters to report\r\nthe latest security leak. On the control deck the major paced back and\r\nforth restlessly as Tom guided the _Polaris_ on its short flight.\r\n\r\n\"I'll find the spy in the Solar Guard if I have to tear Venusport apart\r\npiece by piece!\" fumed Connel.\r\n\r\n\"What about that jet freighter we took away from the Nationalists, sir?\"\r\nasked Tom. \"Did you ever find out where it came from?\"\r\n\r\nConnel nodded. \"It was an old bucket on the Southern Colonial run. She\r\nwas reported lost last year. Somehow those jokers got hold of her and\r\narmed her to the teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think maybe the crew could have mutinied, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's highly possible, Corbett,\" answered Connel, and glanced around.\r\n\"If they have any other ships of that size, the _Polaris_ will be able\r\nto handle them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" Tom smiled. \"The repair crew did a good job on her.\" The\r\ncadet paused. \"Do you suppose one of the Nationalists planted that bomb\r\non her fin?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it,\" replied Connel. \"And it seems to tie in with a rather\r\nstrange thing that happened in the Venusian Delegate's office the day\r\nbefore it happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that, sir?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Three priority orders for seats aboard a Venusport--Atom City express\r\nwere stolen. Before a check could be made, the ship had made its run and\r\nthe people using the priorities were gone. They must have been the ones\r\nthat bumped you off your seats.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you think that ties in with the bomb on the _Polaris_, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're trying to figure that out now,\" said Connel. \"If only we knew\r\nwhat they looked like it would help. The girl at the ticket office\r\ndoesn't remember them and neither does the ship's stewardess.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we saw them, sir!\" exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n\"You what!\" roared Connel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. We were standing there at the ticket counter when they called\r\nfor their tickets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you'd recognize them again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say!\" asserted Tom. \"And I'm sure Astro and Roger would, too. We\r\nwere so mad, we could have blasted them on the spot.\"\r\n\r\nConnel turned to the intercom and shouted, \"Manning, haven't you got\r\nthat circuit through yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Working on it, sir.\" Roger's voice was smooth and unruffled over the\r\nintercom. \"I'm in contact with the commander's ship now. They're calling\r\nhim to the radar bridge now.\"\r\n\r\nTom suddenly jumped out of his seat as though stung. \"Say! I saw one of\r\nthe fellows again too!\"\r\n\r\nConnel whirled quickly to face the young cadet. \"Where?\" he demanded.\r\n\"Where did you see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I'm trying to remember.\" Tom began pacing the deck, snapping his\r\nfingers impatiently. \"It was sometime during the past few days--I know\r\nit was!\"\r\n\r\n\"In Venusport?\" demanded Connel, following Tom around the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"Before or after your trip into the jungle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uhh--before, I think,\" Tom replied hesitantly. \"No. No. It was after we\r\ncame back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, out with it, Corbett!\" exploded the major. \"When? Where? You\r\ndidn't do that much visiting! You were too tired to move!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it, sir,\" said Tom, shaking his head. \"I was so tired\r\neverything was a blur. Faces are all mixed up. I--I--\" The boy stopped\r\nand put his hands to his head as though trying to squeeze the one vital\r\nface out of his hazy memory.\r\n\r\nConnel kept after him like a hungry, stalking animal. \"Where, Corbett?\r\nWhen?\" he shouted. \"You've got to remember. This is important! Think,\r\nblast you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm trying, sir,\" replied the cadet. \"But it just won't come to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe buzz of the intercom suddenly sounded and Connel reluctantly left\r\nTom to answer it. Roger's voice crackled over the speaker. \"I have\r\nCommander Walters now, sir. Feeding him down to the control-deck\r\nteleceiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right,\" replied Connel and turned to Tom. \"Come on, Corbett. I\r\nwant you to report to the commander personally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom, walking slowly to the teleceiver. \"I'm sorry I\r\ncan't remember where I saw that man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget it,\" Connel said gruffly. \"It'll come to you again sometime.\" He\r\npaused and then added as gently as he could, \"Sorry I blasted you like\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Commander Walters' face appeared on the teleceiver screen, Connel\r\nreported the incident of the cab driver and the news that Tom, Roger,\r\nand Astro had seen the three men who had taken the priorities on the\r\n_Venus Lark_.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute,\" said Walters. \"I'll have a recorder take down the\r\ndescriptions.\"\r\n\r\nConnel motioned to Tom, who stepped before the screen. When he saw\r\nWalters nod, he gave a complete description of the three men he had seen\r\nin the Atom City spaceport.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see, now,\" said Walters, after Tom had concluded his report. \"The\r\nman who asked for the tickets was young, about twenty-two, dressed in\r\nVenusian clothing, dark, six feet tall, weighed about one hundred and\r\nfifty pounds. Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom.\r\n\r\nConnel suddenly stepped before the screen to interject, \"And Corbett saw\r\nhim in Venusport again sometime during the last two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really? Where?\"\r\n\r\nConnel glanced at Tom and then replied hurriedly, \"Well, he can't be\r\nsure, sir. We rushed him around pretty fast and he saw a lot of people.\r\nBut at least we know he's in Venusport somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" nodded Walters. \"That's something to work on, at least. And you\r\nhave nothing more to add to the descriptions of the other two, Corbett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not anything particular, sir,\" said Tom. \"They were dressed in\r\nVenusian-type clothes also, but we didn't get a close look at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Walters. \"Proceed with your mission, Major. I'll have\r\nan alert sent out for the cab driver, and I'll have the owner of the\r\npawnshop picked up. There must be someone on the Solar Delegate's staff\r\nwho stole those priorities. We'll start searching there first, and if we\r\ncome up with anyone who can't explain his absence from Venusport at the\r\ntime the priorities were used, and fits Corbett's description, we'll\r\ncontact you. End transmission!\"\r\n\r\n\"End transmission!\" repeated Connel. The screen blanked out and Roger's\r\nvoice came over the intercom immediately. \"We'll be over Sinclair's in\r\nthree minutes,\" he called. \"Stand by.\"\r\n\r\nTom turned to the controls and in exactly two minutes and fifty seconds\r\nthe clearing surrounding Sinclair's home and the burned outbuildings\r\ncame into view. Working effortlessly, with almost casual teamwork, the\r\nthree cadets brought the giant spaceship to rest in the middle of the\r\nclearing. As the power was cut, the cadets saw George and Mrs. Hill\r\njumping into a jet car and speeding out to greet them.\r\n\r\nAfter Tom introduced Connel to the couple, the major questioned them\r\nclosely about their absence during the attack by the shock troops.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sinclair often gives us time off for a trip into Venusport,\"\r\nexplained Hill. \"It gets pretty lonely out here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Sinclair in now?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"No, he isn't,\" replied the plantation foreman. \"He's on his weekly trip\r\naround the outer fields. I don't expect him back for another day or\r\ntwo.\"\r\n\r\n\"For goodness sakes,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hill, \"you can ask your questions\r\njust as easily and a darn sight more comfortably in the house! Come on.\r\nLet's get out of the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe small group climbed into the jet car and roared off across the\r\nclearing toward the house. The lone building left standing by the\r\nNationalists looked strange amid the charred ruins of the other\r\nbuildings. In the house, the three cadets busied themselves with\r\nhome-baked apple pie which the housekeeper had brought out, while Connel\r\nwas telling George of the attack on the plantation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I've known about them all along, of course,\" said the foreman. \"But I\r\nnever paid any attention to them. I just quit, like Mr. Sinclair, when\r\nthey started all that tomfoolery about wearing uniforms and stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Connel, accepting a wedge of pie at Mrs. Hill's insistence,\r\n\"now they've made the wrong move. Burning Sinclair's property and\r\nattacking an officer of the Solar Guard is going too far.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" asked George.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not at liberty to say, Mr. Hill,\" replied Connel. \"But I can tell\r\nyou this. When any person, or group of persons, tries to dictate to the\r\nAlliance, the Solar Guard steps in and puts a stop to it!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the silence of the jungle clearing was shattered by the roar of\r\na single jet craft coming in for a landing. Without looking out the\r\nwindow, George smiled and said, \"There's Mr. Sinclair now! I know the\r\nsound of his jets.\"\r\n\r\nThe group crowded out onto the front porch while George took the jet car\r\nand drove off to pick up his employer. A few moments later Sinclair was\r\nseated before Connel, wiping his sweating brow and accepting a cool\r\ndrink from Mrs. Hill.\r\n\r\n\"I was on my way to the north boundary when I saw your ship landing,\"\r\nexplained Sinclair. \"At first I thought it might be those devils coming\r\nback, but then I saw the Solar Guard insigne on the ship and figured it\r\nmight be you.\" He looked at Connel closely. \"Anything new, Major?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" replied Connel. \"But you can rest assured that you won't be\r\nbothered by them again.\"\r\n\r\nSinclair paused, eying the major speculatively. \"You know, as soon as\r\nyou left, I went over to talk to Al Sharkey. I was plenty mad and really\r\nblasted him, but he swears that he was in Venusport at the time and\r\ndoesn't know a thing about the raid.\"\r\n\r\nConnel nodded. \"That's true. We checked on him. But while he might not\r\nhave been in on the raid itself, there's nothing that says he didn't\r\norder it done!\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it,\" said Sinclair, with a queer apologetic note in his voice.\r\n\"I'm inclined to believe that it was nothing more than a bunch of the\r\nyounger, more hotheaded kids in the organization. As a matter of fact,\r\nSharkey told me he was quitting as president. Seems you fellows in\r\nVenusport scared him plenty. Not only that, but I heard him calling up\r\nthe other planters telling them what happened and every one of them is\r\nchipping in to rebuild my plantation.\"\r\n\r\nConnel looked at the planter steely-eyed. \"So you think it was done by a\r\nbunch of kids, huh?\"\r\n\r\nSinclair nodded. \"Wouldn't be surprised if they're not scared too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are entitled to your opinion, Mr. Sinclair. And if the other\r\nplanters are going to rebuild your buildings, that's fine and charitable\r\nof them.\" Suddenly Connel's voice became harsh. \"That does not, however,\r\nerase the fact that a group of uniformed men, armed with paralo-ray guns\r\nand with ships equipped with blasters, attacked you! Atomic blasters,\r\nMr. Sinclair, are not bought at the local credit exchange. They are made\r\nexclusively for the Solar Guard! That bunch of hotheaded kids, as you\r\ncall them, are capable of attacking any community--even ships of the\r\nSolar Guard itself! That is a threat to the peace of the solar system\r\nand must be stopped!\"\r\n\r\nSinclair nodded quickly. \"Oh, I agree, Major, I agree. I'm just saying\r\nthat--\"\r\n\r\nConnel stopped him. \"I understand, Mr. Sinclair. You're a peaceful man\r\nand want to keep your life peaceful. But my job is to ensure that peace.\r\nAs long as a group of militant toughs like we had here are on the loose,\r\nyou won't have peace. You'll have pieces!\"\r\n\r\nTom, Roger, and Astro, sitting quietly and listening, felt like standing\r\nup and cheering as the major finished.\r\n\r\n\"I know you can't tell me what you're going to do, Major Connel,\" said\r\nthe planter, \"but I hope that you'll allow me to help in any way I can.\"\r\n\r\nConnel hesitated before answering. \"Thank you, Mr. Sinclair. But I'm not\r\nhere officially now.\" And then he added, \"Nor in regard to the\r\nNationalists.\"\r\n\r\nSinclair's eyes lit up slightly. \"Oh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. As you know, the cadets had quite a time with a tyrannosaurus. They\r\nwounded it and it might still be dangerous. That is, more dangerous than\r\nnormally. I've got orders to track him down and finish him off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you said you were going to put a stop to this business\r\nwith the Nationalists,\" said the planter.\r\n\r\n\"I said the Solar Guard would, Sinclair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" mumbled Sinclair, \"the Solar Guard. Of course.\"\r\n\r\nConnel got up abruptly. \"I would appreciate it if you would look after\r\nour ship, though,\" he said. \"I don't think we'll be longer than a week.\r\nShouldn't be hard to track a tyrannosaurus, especially if it's wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you have all the equipment you need,\" said Sinclair.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" replied Connel. Then, thanking Mrs. Hill for the\r\nrefreshments, the burly spaceman and the three cadets said good-by and\r\nleft the house.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, ready to strike off into the jungle, the Solar Guard\r\nofficer took four of the latest model shock rifles out of the arms\r\nlocker of the _Polaris_ and gave one to each boy with extra ammunition.\r\n\"Never go after a giant with a popgun,\" he said. \"It's a wonder you\r\ndidn't kill yourselves with those old blasters you used, let alone kill\r\na tyranno.\"\r\n\r\nThe three cadets examined the rifles closely and with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"These are the latest Solar Guard issue,\" said Connel. \"When you pull\r\nthat trigger, you release a force three times greater than anything put\r\ninto a rifle before.\"\r\n\r\nThen, checking the _Polaris_ and cutting all power, Connel removed the\r\nmaster switch and hid it. \"That's so no one will get any bright ideas\r\nwhile we're gone,\" he explained as the boys watched curiously.\r\n\r\n\"You think someone might try to steal her, sir?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"You never can tell, Corbett,\" answered Connel noncommittally.\r\n\r\nOnce again the three boys moved across the clearing toward the jungle\r\nwall. Astro took the lead as before, followed by Roger and Tom, and\r\nConnel brought up the rear. They moved directly to the spot where they\r\nhad last seen the tyrannosaurus, found the trampled underbrush and\r\nmassive tracks, and moved purposefully into the dank, suffocating green\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe trail was plain to see. Where the boys once had to hack their way\r\nthrough the thick underbrush, the monster had created a path for them.\r\nThe three cadets felt better about being back in the jungle with more\r\nreliable equipment and joked about what they would do to the\r\ntyrannosaurus when they saw it again.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were supposed to be the home-grown Venusian hick that\r\ncould manage in the jungle like that fairy-tale character, Tarzan,\"\r\nRoger teased Astro.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, you sleepwalking space Romeo,\" growled Astro, \"I know more\r\nabout this jungle than you could learn in ten years. And I'm not foolish\r\nenough to battle with a tyranno with the odds on his side. I ran for a\r\ngood reason!\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy, did you run!\" taunted Roger. \"You were as fast as the _Polaris_ on\r\nemergency thrust!\"\r\n\r\n\"Knock off that rocket wash!\" roared Connel. \"The Nationalists might\r\nhave security patrols in this area. They could hear you talking and\r\nblast you before you could bat an eyelash! Now keep quiet and stay\r\nalert!\"\r\n\r\nThe three cadets quieted down after that, walking carefully, stepping\r\naround dead brush that might betray their presence. After working their\r\nway along the tyrannosaurus's trail for several hours, Connel called a\r\nhalt, and after a quick look at his compass, motioned for them to cut\r\naway from the monster's tracks.\r\n\r\n\"We'll start working around in a circle,\" he said. \"One day east, one\r\nsouth, west, and north. Then we'll move in closer to the heart of the\r\ncircle, and repeat the same procedure. That should cover a lot of ground\r\nin eight days. If anything's moving around out here, besides what should\r\nbe here, we'll find it. From now on, we'll have a scout. Astro, you know\r\nthe jungle, you take the point, about five hundred yards ahead. If you\r\nsee anything, signs of a patrol or any danger from the jungle, fall back\r\nand report. Don't try to do anything yourself. Four guns in a good\r\nposition are better than one popping off by itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Astro. With a quick nod to Tom and Roger, he moved\r\noff through the jungle. In ten feet he was invisible. In thirty seconds\r\nhis footsteps were lost in the thousands of jungle sounds around them.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take the lead now,\" said Connel. \"Corbett, you bring up the rear.\r\nAll right, move out!\"\r\n\r\nFrom above, in the leafy roof covering the jungle; from the side, in the\r\nthick tangle of vines; and from below, in the thorny underbrush, the\r\neyes of living things, jungle things, followed the movements of the\r\nthree spacemen, perhaps wondering if these new beasts were a threat to\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hal-loo-ooo!\"\r\n\r\nAstro's voice boomed out over the tops of the trees, where the birds\r\nfluttered in sudden fright. It echoed through the darkness around him,\r\nwhere smaller creatures crawled and slithered into the protection of\r\ntheir holes. The voice of the big cadet was loud, but it was not loud\r\nenough for his mates to hear.\r\n\r\nAstro was lost.\r\n\r\nHe couldn't understand how it had happened. Over and over during the\r\npast six hours he had retraced his steps mentally, trying to visualize\r\nthe trail, trying to locate the telltale marks he had made with his\r\njungle knife, and so find Major Connel, Tom, and Roger. It was dark now\r\nand the big cadet had to face the dangerous jungle alone. He laughed\r\nironically. Connel had given him the point because he knew the jungle!\r\nAnd now he was lost.\r\n\r\nAstro was a little frightened too. It was his frank realization of\r\ntrouble that made him afraid. He knew what was in the jungle, and though\r\nhe had been there alone before, he had never been in it as deeply as\r\nthis, nor had he ever been lost in the nightmarish place after sundown.\r\n\r\nWhile he was desperately anxious to find his unit mates, he had not\r\nfired his rifle. The threat of exposing his position to a possible\r\nNationalist patrol prevented him from signaling with the blaster or even\r\nfrom building a fire. During the last hours of the day, when the\r\nsuspicion that he was lost became a concrete fact, the big cadet had\r\nbeen reluctant even to yell. Now, with pitch-black night closing around\r\nhim, he dared to call, hoping it would be heard and recognized by his\r\nfriends, or if not, considered the howl of a jungle beast by an enemy\r\npatrol should one be near.\r\n\r\nHe stood with his back against the rough bark of a teakwood tree to\r\nprotect his rear and to face out toward the pitch-black night. More than\r\nonce the big cadet felt the sudden ripple of a crawling thing moving\r\naround him, across his toes or down the tree trunk. There was a sudden\r\nthrashing in the underbrush near by and he brought the shock rifle up\r\nquickly, ears tuned for the growl, or scream, or hiss of an attacking\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nThe luminous dial of his watch showed it to be three thirty in the\r\nmorning, two and a half hours to go before the sun would drive the\r\nfearful darkness away. He had been calling every five minutes. And every\r\ntime he shouted, the movements in the darkness around him increased.\r\n\r\n\"Hal-loo-ooo!\"\r\n\r\nHe waited, turning his head from one side to the other, intent on the\r\nsounds that came from a distance; the answering call of the waddling\r\nground bird that had confused him at first until he recognized it; the\r\nshrill scream of the tiny swamp hog; the distant chattering of the\r\nmonkeylike creatures in the treetops. But there was no sound from a\r\nhuman throat.\r\n\r\nAstro called again and again. The seconds dragged by into minutes, the\r\nminutes into an hour, and then two hours, and finally, as every muscle\r\nin his body ached from standing backed up to the tree all night and\r\nholding his rifle on alert, the gray murky dawn broke over the jungle\r\nand he began to see the green of the jungle around him. When the sun at\r\nlast broke over the Venusian horizon, the night's frost on the leaves\r\nand bushes danced and glittered like jewels.\r\n\r\nHe washed his face in a near-by pool, careful not to drink any of the\r\nwater. He opened a can of synthetic food, and after eating his fill,\r\ncleared away the brush down to the naked black soil and banking it high\r\non all sides he stretched full length on the ground. He dared not sleep.\r\nHungry animals were moving about freely now. A paralo-ray gun and the\r\nrifle, both cocked and ready to fire, were held in his hands. He relaxed\r\nas completely as he could, idly watching the mother of a brood of the\r\nanthropoids scamper through the branches of the trees overhead, bringing\r\nher squalling young their breakfast. An hour later, refreshed, he\r\nstarted through the jungle again, eyes open for signs of recent\r\nactivity, human activity, for the big cadet wanted to return to his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nStopping occasionally to climb a tree, Astro searched the sky above the\r\ntreetops for smoke that would mark a campsite. He felt that sure if\r\nthere was any, he would find Roger, Tom, and Connel, since a Nationalist\r\npatrol wouldn't advertise its presence in the jungle. But there were no\r\nsmoke signs. The top of the jungle stretched green and still as far as\r\nhe could see, steaming under the burning rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nAstro knew that it would be impossible to spend another night like the\r\nfirst in the jungle, so after searching through the forest until three\r\nin the afternoon, he stopped, opened another can of synthetic food, and\r\nate. He was used to being alone now. The first wave of fear had left\r\nhim and he was beginning to remember things he knew as a young boy;\r\njungle signs that warned him of dangers, the quick identification of the\r\nanimal cries, and the knowledge of the habits of the jungle creatures.\r\n\r\nAfter eating, he took his jungle knife and hacked at a long, tough vine,\r\nyanking it down from its lofty tangle. He started weaving it into a\r\ntight oblong basket and two hours later, just before the sun dropped\r\ninto the jungle for the night, he was finished. He had a seven-foot bag\r\nwoven tightly and pulled together with a small opening at one end. Just\r\nbefore the sky darkened, the big cadet crawled into this makeshift\r\nsleeping bag, pulled the opening closed with a tight draw cord, and in\r\nthirty seconds was asleep. Nothing would be able to bite through the\r\ntough vine matting, and the chances of a larger beast accidentally\r\nstepping on him were small. Nevertheless, Astro had pulled the bag close\r\nto a huge tree and placed it deep between the swollen roots.\r\n\r\nHe awoke with a start. The ground was shaking violently. He was sweating\r\nprofusely and judged that it must be late in the morning with the sun\r\nbeating directly on him. Carefully he opened the end of the makeshift\r\nsleeping bag and peered out. He gasped and reached for his shock rifle,\r\nbringing it up into firing position. The sight that confronted him was\r\nat once horrifying and fascinating. A hundred yards away, a giant snake,\r\neasily a hundred feet long and five feet thick, was wrapped around a\r\nraging tyrannosaurus. The monsters were in a fight to death. Astro\r\nshuddered and pulled back into the bag, keeping the blaster aimed at the\r\ntwo struggling beasts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Astro kept his blaster aimed at the monsters_]\r\n\r\nThe big cadet deduced that the snake must have been surprised in its\r\nfeeding by the tyrannosaurus, and was trying to defend itself. There\r\nwasn't a living thing in the jungle that would deliberately attack a\r\ntyrannosaurus. Only man, with his intelligence and deadly weapons,\r\ncould win over the brute force and cunning of the jungle giant. And even\r\nthat had failed with this monster. Astro quickly saw it was the same\r\nbeast that had chased the three cadets out of the jungle!\r\n\r\nWith three coils wrapped around the tyrannosaurus's body, the snake was\r\ntrying to wrap a fourth around its neck and strangle it, but the monster\r\nwas too wily. Rearing back, it suddenly fell to the ground, its weight\r\ncrushing the three coils around its middle. The snake jerked\r\nspasmodically, stunned, as the tyrannosaurus scrambled up again. The\r\nground trembled and branches were ripped from near-by trees. All around\r\nthe jungle had been leveled. Everything fell before the thrashing\r\nmonsters.\r\n\r\nRecovering, the snake's head darted in again, trying to circle the\r\ntyrannosaurus's head and complete the last and fatal coil, but the giant\r\nbeast lunged, its massive jaws snapping, and the snake drew back.\r\nSuddenly its tail lashed out and circled the left legs of the\r\ntyrannosaurus. Astro could see the beast straining against the sudden\r\npressure, at the same time alert for the swooping head of the snake. The\r\npressure on the leg was too great, and the beast fell to the ground,\r\ngiving the snake a momentary advantage. Its head darted in again, but\r\nthe tyrannosaurus drew its head into its narrow shoulders, then shot out\r\nagain as the snake missed. Astro saw the snake quiver and jerk back as\r\nthe tyrannosaurus clamped its jaws closed and bit a chunk out of the\r\ngreen, scaly body.\r\n\r\nThe snake had enough. It wanted to get away, to slip to the top of the\r\ntallest tree in the forest, out of reach of the tyrannosaurus, and wait\r\nfor the wound to heal or for death to come. It unwound in a maddened\r\nconvulsive movement and slithered toward the tree where Astro lay. But\r\nthe monster was after it, immediately grabbing it by the tail and\r\njerking it back. The snake was forced to turn and fight back.\r\n\r\nAstro knew that if the snake could get away it would head for the\r\nteakwood above his head, the highest tree around, and the tyrannosaurus\r\nwould stamp the ground around its base into powder. He had to move!\r\n\r\nA hundred feet to the left was a wild thicket of ground thorns, their\r\nneedlelike tips bristling. Even the snake would stay away from them. It\r\nwas his only chance should the snake get loose from the tyrannosaurus\r\nagain. Making up his mind quickly, the cadet opened the end of the\r\nsleeping bag and shoved his weapons out before him. Then hugging the\r\nground, he dashed across the clearing. This gave the tyrannosaurus its\r\nfinal advantage. The snake pulled back, momentarily attracted by Astro's\r\nmove, and the tyrannosaurus struck, catching the snake just behind the\r\nhead in a grip of death.\r\n\r\nThe thorns ripped at Astro's tight-fitting jungle dress, tearing into\r\nhis flesh as he dove into the thicket. But once inside the cadet lay\r\nstill, pointing his rifle at the tyrannosaurus who was methodically\r\nfinishing off the giant snake. In a few seconds the snake was dead and\r\nthe tyrannosaurus began to feast.\r\n\r\nAstro stayed in the thicket, watching the monster devour nearly all of\r\nthe dead reptile foe and then rise up and move off through the jungle.\r\nAstro knew that in no time the scavengers of the jungle would be\r\nswarming over the remains of the snake. Once again he had to move.\r\n\r\nGetting out of the thicket was painful. From every direction the thorns\r\njabbed at him, and but for the toughness of his jungle suit, Astro would\r\nhave been ripped to shreds. After easing his way back into the\r\nclearing, the cadet pulled out the remains of his jungle pack. He then\r\nsaw that his suit was torn to ribbons, and the many slashes on his chest\r\nand arms were bleeding profusely. The scent of the blood would attract\r\nthe carnivorous creatures, so he stripped off the bloody jungle suit,\r\ndropping it back in the thicket, and hurried away. A short time later he\r\ncame to a water hole where he sponged himself off and applied medication\r\nfrom his emergency kit to the scratches. Finished, he took stock. The\r\nnight's sleep had refreshed him, and except for the loss of his\r\nprotective clothing, he was in good shape. He shouldered the pack,\r\nstrapped the paralo-ray gun to his hips, and gripping the rifle tightly,\r\nhe moved off through the jungle once more. He decided to follow the\r\ntyrannosaurus. The beast would leave a path for him, saving him the\r\neffort of hacking his way through the vines and creepers, and should an\r\nenemy patrol be out, it would stay away from the tyrannosaurus. Finally,\r\nhe knew Tom, Roger, and Connel would go after the beast if they saw it.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone down on the half-naked giant moving through the jungle, a\r\nnew white-skinned animal who was braver than the rest, a creature who\r\ndared to trail the king of the jungle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It's all my fault!\" said Connel disgustedly. \"I should have been able\r\nto read his trail signs.\"\r\n\r\nTom did not answer. He pulled the straps of his jungle pack tighter and\r\nslung it over his shoulder. Roger stood to one side, watching Major\r\nConnel. Both boys sensed what was coming.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is the last day we can spend searching for him,\" said\r\nConnel. \"We've already lost two days.\"\r\n\r\nRoger glanced at Tom and said casually, \"It wouldn't hurt to keep our\r\neyes open for signs of him, would it, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now listen, boys,\" said Connel firmly, \"I know how you feel about\r\nAstro. I have to admit I have a liking for the lad myself. But we've\r\nbeen sent out here to locate the base of operations of the Nationalists.\r\nThe best way to do that is to work around the jungle in a given area. We\r\nhaven't done that so far. We've put all our time and effort into a\r\nrandom search for Astro. We can't signal him, build a fire, shoot off a\r\nblaster--or use any of the simple communication devices. We have to work\r\nunder cover, for fear of giving away our presence here in the jungle.\"\r\nHe slung his gear over his shoulder and added, \"We'll continue our\r\nsearch for Astro until noon and then we simply will have to abandon it.\r\nAnd stop worrying about him. He's a big strong lad and he's been in this\r\njungle alone before. I have every confidence that he can make his way\r\nback to Sinclair's plantation safely.\"\r\n\r\nThe Solar Guard officer paused and looked at the two downcast cadets\r\nbefore him. \"None of that sulking business!\" he growled. \"You're cadets\r\non an urgent mission. Now move out. I'll take the point first and you\r\nbring up the rear, Corbett.\" Without another word, the burly spaceman\r\nturned and moved off through the jungle.\r\n\r\nRoger hung back to talk to Tom. \"What do you think, Tom?\"\r\n\r\nTom shook his head before answering. \"He's right, Roger. We're on a job.\r\nIt's the same here in the jungle as it is in space. We know that\r\nsomething is liable to happen to any one of us at any time. And the\r\nmission always comes first.\"\r\n\r\nRoger nodded. \"Sure, that's the way it is in the book. But this is\r\nreal. That big hick might be hurt--or trapped. Maybe he needs our help!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know how you feel, Roger,\" replied Tom. \"I want to take off and hunt\r\nfor Astro myself, but Connel needs us. Don't forget that bunch of guys\r\nin uniforms back at Sinclair's. Commander Walters and the others don't\r\nhold conferences like that one back in Venusport for the fun of it. This\r\nis serious.\"\r\n\r\nRoger shrugged and started off after Connel, Tom following slowly\r\nbehind. Their march through the jungle was made in silence, each hoping\r\nfor a miracle. But as the sun grew higher and the deadline hour of noon\r\napproached, they steeled themselves to the fact that they might never\r\nsee the Venusian cadet again. A short time later, when Tom was taking\r\nhis turn at cutting the trail through the brush, he broke through into a\r\nclearing. He stopped and called out, \"Major! Roger! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nConnel and the blond-haired cadet rushed forward, stopping beside Tom to\r\nstare in amazement. Before them, a large area of the jungle was pounded\r\ndown and lying amidst the tangle of giant creepers and uprooted bushes\r\nwas the remains of a giant snake.\r\n\r\n\"By the rings of Saturn!\" gasped Connel, walking forward to inspect the\r\nclearing. Tom and Roger followed, breaking to the side, their rifles at\r\nready. The two boys had become jungle-wise quickly and knew that death\r\nlurked behind the wall of green surrounding the cleared area.\r\n\r\n\"It must have been some fight!\" Connel pointed to the tracks of the\r\ntyrannosaurus. \"The tyranno must have stumbled on the snake while it was\r\nfeeding,\" said Connel. \"Otherwise it would have lit out for that tree\r\nover there.\" He pointed to the giant teakwood that Astro had slept\r\nunder. The three spacemen saw the makeshift sleeping bag at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Major! Look!\" cried Tom and raced to the base of the tree.\r\n\r\n\"It's Astro's, all right,\" said Connel, examining the woven bag. \"I\r\nwonder if he was here when those two things were going after each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger in a choked whisper, \"he was.\" He pointed to the\r\nragged remains of Astro's jungle suit dangling on the near-by thornbush.\r\nThe blood was stiff on the material.\r\n\r\nThe three Earthmen stared at the suit, each too horrified to speak.\r\n\r\nConnel's face was set in hard lines as he finally found his voice and\r\ngrowled, \"Our search is over. Let's get back to our job.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until late the same afternoon that Astro, following the trail\r\nof the tyrannosaurus, realized that the giant beast was seriously hurt.\r\nAt first the traces of blood on the ground and underbrush were slight,\r\nbut gradually the blood spots became more profuse and the trail was\r\ncovered with huge blotches of red. The Venusian cadet grew more\r\ncautious. The tyrannosaurus would be ten times as dangerous now. And it\r\nmight be close by, lying in the jungle, licking its wounds.\r\n\r\nAs the sun began to sink in the western Venusian sky, Astro began to\r\nthink about the coming night. He would have to hole up. He couldn't\r\nchance stumbling into the beast in the dark. But it would also mean\r\ntaking time to make another sleeping bag. Suddenly he saw a movement in\r\nthe brush to his left. He dropped to the ground and aimed the shock\r\nrifle in that direction, eyes probing the green tangle for further\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\"Make one move and you'll die!\" a harsh voice cut through the jungle.\r\nAstro remained still, his eyes darting to left and right, trying to\r\nlocate the owner of the voice.\r\n\r\n\"Throw down your gun and stand up with your hands over your head!\" came\r\nanother voice, this one immediately behind him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _His eyes probed the jungle for further movement_]\r\n\r\nA patrol! Astro swore at himself for blindly walking into a trap and\r\ndropped his gun. He stood up and raised his hands over his head, turning\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't turn around! Stand still!\"\r\n\r\nAstro stopped.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the rustle of movement in the underbrush behind him and\r\nthen someone called, \"Circle around to the right. Spread out and see if\r\nthere are any others!\"\r\n\r\nOff to the side, he could hear the crashing of footsteps moving away in\r\nthe jungle.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" continued the unknown voice, \"drop that paralo-ray pistol\r\nto the ground. But no smart tricks. We can see you and you can't see us,\r\nso take it easy and do as we say.\"\r\n\r\nAstro lowered his hands and unbuckled the gun belt, letting it fall to\r\nthe ground. There was a sudden burst of movement behind him and powerful\r\narms gripped his wrists. Within seconds his hands were tied quickly and\r\nexpertly, and he was spun around to face his captors.\r\n\r\nThere were ten men, all dressed in the same green uniforms and plastic\r\nheadgear he had seen at the Sinclair plantation. They stood in a\r\nsemicircle around him, their guns leveled at his naked chest. The leader\r\nof the party nudged the nearest man and commented, \"Never thought I'd\r\nsee any animal like this in the jungle!\" The other men laughed\r\nappreciatively.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" the leader demanded. \"What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Astro,\" replied the big cadet boldly. \"I'm a Space Cadet,\r\n_Polaris_ unit, Space Academy, U.S.A. I'm here in the jungle with the\r\nrest of my unit hunting tyrannosaurus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tyranno, eh?\" queried the man. \"How long have you been trailing this\r\none?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just today. I saw him fight a big snake and lost my jungle gear in a\r\nthicket where I was hiding. I was separated from my space buddies two\r\ndays ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, Helia,\" suddenly called one of the other men, \"he sounds like a\r\nVenusian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that true?\" asked the leader. \"Are you from Venus?\"\r\n\r\nAstro nodded. \"Venusport.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why are you in Space Academy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to be a spaceman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you go to school on Venus, instead of Earth. We have good\r\nspace schools here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want a commission in the Solar Guard. You can only get that through\r\nthe Academy,\" replied Astro stoutly.\r\n\r\n\"Solar Guard!\" snorted the leader, and then turned to the nearest man,\r\nspeaking rapidly in a strange tongue.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the language confused Astro, then he recognized it as the\r\nancient Venusian dialect. He understood it and started to answer, but\r\nthen, on second thought, he decided not to reveal his knowledge of the\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe leader turned back to Astro and asked a question.\r\n\r\nAstro shook his head and said, \"If you're talking to me, you have to\r\nspeak English. I know that's the Venusian dialect you're speaking, but I\r\nnever learned it.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader's fist shot out and crashed against Astro's jaw. The big\r\ncadet rocked back with the punch and then he lunged forward, straining\r\nagainst his bonds.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you--!\" he exploded angrily.\r\n\r\n\"That was for not being a true Venusian!\" snapped the leader. \"Every son\r\nof Venus should understand his mother tongue!\"\r\n\r\nAstro bit his lip and fell silent.\r\n\r\nThe leader turned away, and shouting a command, started off through the\r\njungle. Astro knew that the patrol had been ordered to move out, but he\r\nstood still, waiting for them to push him. They did. A hard jab in his\r\nnaked side with the butt of a gun sent him stumbling forward in the\r\ncenter of the patrol.\r\n\r\nWell, there was one consolation, he thought grimly. At least he wouldn't\r\nhave to spend the night out in the jungle alone again!\r\n\r\nAstro had expected a long march, but to his surprise, he was pushed\r\nalong a well-worn jungle trail for only three hundred yards in from the\r\ntyrannosaurus's track. Finally they stopped before a huge teakwood tree.\r\nThe leader pounded his rifle butt on the trunk three times.\r\n\r\nMystified, Astro watched a small section of the trunk open to reveal a\r\nmodern vacuum-tube elevator shaft. He was pushed inside with the men of\r\nthe patrol and the tree-trunk door was closed. The leader pushed a lever\r\nand the car dropped so suddenly that Astro nearly lost his balance. He\r\njudged that they must have fallen two hundred feet when the car stopped\r\nand another door opened. He was pushed out into a high-vaulted tunnel\r\nwith cement walls.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up!\" snapped the leader.\r\n\r\nThe big cadet moved along the tunnel, followed by the patrol, turning\r\nfrom one tunnel into another, all of them slanting downhill. Astro\r\nguessed that he was being taken to some subterranean cave. He asked his\r\ncaptors where they were taking him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk!\" snapped one of the men at his side.\r\n\r\n\"This jungle will be swarming with Solar Guardsmen once they discover\r\nI'm lost,\" said Astro. \"Who are you and what are you holding me prisoner\r\nfor?\" The big cadet decided it would be better to feign ignorance of the\r\nexistence of the rebel organization.\r\n\r\n\"Let the Solar Guard come!\" snapped the leader. \"They'll find something\r\nthey never expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you want with _me_?\" asked the cadet.\r\n\r\n\"You'll know soon enough!\"\r\n\r\nThey had been walking for nearly an hour and the tunnels still slanted\r\ndownward but more sharply now. Turning into a much larger tunnel than\r\nany of the rest, Astro noticed a huge door on one side. Through its\r\ncrystal-covered ports he saw racks of illegal heat blasters and\r\nparalo-ray guns. A man stepped out of the door, and raising his hand in\r\na form of salute, called out a few words in the Venusian tongue. Astro\r\nrecognized it as a greeting, \"Long live Venusians!\" and suppressed a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the men of the patrol handed over their rifles and ray guns,\r\nwhile the man in the armory checked off their names. Then they all\r\nremoved their knee-length jungle boots and traded their plastic helmets\r\nfor others of the same design but of a lighter material. Each man turned\r\nhis back while switching helmets, obviously to avoid being recognized by\r\nany of the others, since the new helmet was also frosted except for a\r\nslit at eye level. Wearing the lighter headgear and common street shoes,\r\nthe men continued their march through the tunnel. They passed into a\r\nstill larger tunnel, and for the first time, Astro could see daylight.\r\nAs they drew nearer to the mouth of the tunnel, the cadet could see\r\noutside, and the scene before him made him gasp for breath.\r\n\r\nA full twenty miles long and fifteen miles wide, a canyon stretched\r\nbefore him. And it seemed to the big cadet that every square inch of the\r\ncanyon floor was occupied by buildings and spaceships. Hundreds of\r\ngreen-clad men were moving around the ships and buildings.\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" gasped Astro as the patrol paused in the mouth\r\nof the tunnel. \"What--what is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first city of Venus. True Venus. Built by Venusians with Venusian\r\nmaterials only!\" said the leader proudly. \"There's the answer to your\r\nSolar Guard!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand,\" said Astro. \"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see.\" The man chuckled. \"You'll see. Move on!\"\r\n\r\nAs they trooped out of the tunnel and down into the canyon they passed\r\ngroups of men working on the many ships. The cadet recognized what they\r\nwere doing at once. The unmistakable outlines of gun ports were being\r\ncut into the sides of several bulky space freighters. Elsewhere, the\r\nsteady pounding of metal and grinding of machinery told the cadet that\r\nmachine shops were going at full blast. He noticed a difference between\r\nthe men of the patrol and the workers. Neither spoke to the other. In\r\nfact, Astro saw that it was rarely that a worker even glanced at them as\r\nthey passed by.\r\n\r\nUp ahead, Astro saw a huge building, wide and sprawling but only a few\r\nstories high. It was nearly dark now and lights began to wink on in the\r\nmany windows. He guessed that he was being taken to the building and was\r\nnot surprised when the leader pulled him by the arm, guiding him toward\r\na small side door. There was a curious look about the building and the\r\ncadet couldn't figure out what it was. Glancing quickly at the wall as\r\nhe passed through the door, he nearly burst out laughing. The building\r\nwas made of wood! He guessed that the rebels were using materials at\r\nhand rather than importing anything from outside planets. And since\r\nVenus was largely a planet of jungles and vegetation, with few large\r\nmineral deposits, wood would be the easiest thing to use.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the building was handsomely decorated and designed. He saw\r\nwalls covered with carvings, depicting old legends about the first\r\ncolonists. He shook his head. \"Boy,\" he thought, \"they sure go for the\r\nVenusian stuff in a big way!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" snapped the leader. \"Stop here!\"\r\n\r\nAstro stood before a huge double door that had been polished to a\r\nbrilliant luster. The cadet waited for the leader to enter, but the\r\nNationalist stood perfectly still, eyes straight ahead. Suddenly the\r\ndoors swung open, revealing a huge chamber, at least a hundred and fifty\r\nfeet long. At the far end a man dressed in white with a green band\r\nacross his chest sat in a beautifully carved chair. Arrayed on either\r\nside of him were fifty or more men dressed in various shades of green.\r\nThe man in white lifted his hand and the patrol leader stepped forward,\r\npushing Astro before him. They walked across the polished floor and\r\nstopped ten feet away from the man in white, the patrol leader bowing\r\ndeeply. Astro glanced at the men standing at either side of the man in\r\nwhite. The bulge of paralo-ray pistols was plainly visible beneath their\r\nflowing robes.\r\n\r\nThe man in white lifted his hand in the salute Astro had seen before.\r\nThen the patrol leader straightened up and began to speak rapidly in the\r\nVenusian dialect. Translating easily, Astro heard him report his\r\ncapture. When he concluded, the man in white looked at Astro closely and\r\nspoke three words. Astro shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"He does not speak our mother tongue, Lactu,\" volunteered the patrol\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nThe man in white nodded. \"How is it,\" he said in English, \"that you are\r\na native-born Venusian and do not speak the language of your planet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was an orphan. I had very little formal education,\" said Astro. \"And\r\nas long as we're asking questions around here, how about my asking a\r\nfew? Who in space are you? What's the idea of holding me a prisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"One question at a time, please, brother Venusian,\" said the man in\r\nwhite. \"And when you address me, my name is Lactu.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lactu what?\" asked Astro belligerently.\r\n\r\n\"Your own name should tell you that we on Venus only have one name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that rocket wash!\" barked Astro. \"When do I get out of\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will never leave here as you came,\" said Lactu quietly.\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" demanded the cadet.\r\n\r\n\"You have discovered the existence of our base. Ordinarily you would\r\nhave been burned to a crisp and left in the jungle. Fortunately, you are\r\na Venusian by birth, and therefore have the right to join our\r\norganization.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means,\" said Lactu, \"that you will take an oath to fight until death\r\nif necessary to free the planet Venus and the Venusian citizens from the\r\nslavery of the Solar Alliance and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Awright, buster!\" roared Astro. \"I've had enough of that rocket wash! I\r\ntook an oath of allegiance to the Solar Guard and the Solar Alliance, to\r\nuphold the cause of peace throughout the universe and defend the\r\nliberties of the planets. Your idea is to destroy peace and make slaves\r\nout of the people of Venus--like these dummies you've got here!\" Astro\r\ngestured contemptuously at the men standing on both sides of Lactu. \"I\r\ndon't want any part of you, so start blasting!\" continued the big cadet,\r\nhis voice booming out in the big room. \"But make it good, 'cause I'm\r\ntough!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur among the men and several put their hands on the\r\nbutts of their paralo-ray guns. Even the calm expression in Lactu's eyes\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n\"You are not afraid of us, are you?\" he asked in a low, almost surprised\r\ntone of voice.\r\n\r\n\"You, nor anything that crawls in the jungle like you!\" shouted Astro.\r\n\"If you're not happy with the way things are run on Venus, why don't\r\nyou take your beef to the Solar Alliance?\"\r\n\r\n\"We prefer to do it our way!\" snapped one of the men near Lactu. \"And as\r\nfor you, a few lashes with a Venusian wet whip will teach you to keep a\r\ncivil tongue!\"\r\n\r\nAstro turned around slowly, looking at each of the men individually. \"I\r\npromise you,\" he said slowly, \"the first man who lays a whip on me will\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who, pray, will do the killing?\" snorted a short, stout figure in\r\nthe darkest of the green uniforms. \"You? Hardly!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it isn't me\"--Astro turned to face the man--\"it will be any one of a\r\nthousand Space Cadets.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a lot of confidence in yourself and your friends,\" said Lactu.\r\n\"Death apparently doesn't frighten you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more than it does any man of honor,\" said the cadet. \"I've faced\r\ndeath before. As for my friends\"--Astro shrugged and grinned--\"touch me\r\nand wait for what happens. And by the stars, mister, you can depend on\r\nit happening!\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough of this, Lactu!\" said a man near the end of the group. \"We have\r\nimportant business to conduct. Take this foolish boy out and do away\r\nwith him!\"\r\n\r\nLactu waved his hand gently. \"Observe, gentlemen, here is the true\r\nspirit of Venus. This boy is not an Earthman, nor a Martian. He is a\r\nVenusian--a proud Venusian who has drifted with the tides of space and\r\ntaken life where he found it. Tell me honestly, gentlemen, what would\r\nyou have thought of Astro, a Venusian, if he had acted any differently\r\nthan he has? If he had taken an oath he does not believe and groveled at\r\nour feet? No, gentlemen, to kill this proud, freeborn Venusian would be\r\na crime. Tell me, Astro, do you have any skills?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can handle nuclear materials in any form.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are wasting time, Lactu!\" exclaimed one of the men suddenly. \"Settle\r\nwith this upstart later. Now let us take a vote on the issue before us.\r\nThe ship is waiting to blast off for Mercury. Do we ask for her\r\nassistance, or not?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a loud murmur among the assembled men, and Lactu held up his\r\nhand. \"Very well, we will vote. All in favor of asking the people of\r\nMercury to join our movement against the Alliance will say aye!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" chorused the men.\r\n\r\n\"Against?\"\r\n\r\nLactu looked around, but there was no reply.\r\n\r\nLactu turned back to Astro. \"Well, Venusian, this is your last chance to\r\njoin forces with us and to fight for your mother planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go blast your jets!\" snapped Astro. Immediately Lactu's eyes became\r\nhard steely points.\r\n\r\n\"That was your last chance!\" he said. \"Take him out and kill him!\"\r\n\r\nThe door suddenly burst open and a green-clad trooper raced across the\r\nbare floor, bowing hastily before Lactu. \"Forgive this interruption,\r\nLactu,\" he said breathlessly. \"There are men in the jungle headed for\r\nthe canyon rim. Three of them!\"\r\n\r\nLactu turned to Astro. \"Your friends, no doubt!\" He snapped an order.\r\n\"Capture them and bring them to me. And as for you, Astro, we are in\r\nneed of capable men to build war heads for our space torpedoes. To\r\nensure the safety of your friends, I would advise your working for us.\r\nIf not, your friends will die before another night falls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Tom,\" said Major Connel. \"They must be around here\r\nsomewhere. Start looking. If they're not here, it may mean he's still\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Tom who had thought of looking for Astro's weapons. Refusing to\r\nbelieve that his unit mate had been killed, the curly-haired cadet was\r\nexamining the torn jungle suit when the idea occurred to him.\r\n\r\nQuickly Roger, Connel, and Tom spread out over the trampled area,\r\nsearching the underbrush for Astro's paralo-ray pistol or shock rifle.\r\nConnel examined the underbrush and vines closely for scorch marks made\r\nby the blaster. Finding none, he rejoined the boys.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, sir,\" replied Roger.\r\n\r\n\"Can't find them, Major,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nConnel smacked his fists together and spoke excitedly. \"I'm sure Astro\r\nwouldn't be caught unawares by a couple of things like a snake or a\r\ntyrannosaurus without putting up a fight. If he was attacked suddenly,\r\nhe would have fired at least one shot, and if it went wild, it would\r\nhave burned the vines and brush around here. You didn't find his\r\nweapons, and there are no scorched areas. I'll stake my life on it,\r\nAstro's alive!\"\r\n\r\nRoger's and Tom's faces brightened. They knew Connel had no proof, but\r\nthey were willing to believe anything that would keep their hopes for\r\ntheir giant unit mate alive.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Connel, \"assuming he is not dead, and that he is somewhere\r\nin the jungle, we have to figure out what he would do.\"\r\n\r\nRoger was thoughtful a moment. \"How long would he last without his\r\njungle suit, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\nTom's eyes lit up. \"If he's alive, sir, then he's probably following a\r\npath or trail that would keep him away from heavy underbrush,\" he said.\r\n\r\nConnel thought a moment. \"There's only one trail away from here.\" He\r\nturned and pointed to the trail made by the tyrannosaurus. \"That one.\"\r\n\r\nThe three spacemen stared at the wide path left by the huge beast.\r\nConnel hesitated. \"It's due north,\" he said finally. \"We've come a full\r\nday west and should be making a turn north. We'll follow the\r\ntyrannosaurus's trail for a full day.\"\r\n\r\nRoger and Tom grinned. They knew Connel was making every effort to find\r\nAstro, while still keeping his mission in mind.\r\n\r\nThe three spacemen moved along the trail quickly, eyes alert for any\r\nsign Astro might have left. Connel saw the great bloodstains left by the\r\ntyrannosaurus and cautioned the two cadets. \"This tyranno is wounded\r\npretty badly. It might be heading back for its lair, but it might not\r\nmake it, and stop along the way. Be careful and keep your eyes open for\r\nany sign that he might have--\"\r\n\r\nConnel was stopped by Tom's sudden cry. \"Major! Look!\"\r\n\r\nConnel turned and stared. A thousand yards ahead of them on the broken\r\ntrail they saw the monstrous bulk of a tyrannosaurus emerge from the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" breathed Connel, \"that's the one!\"\r\n\r\nThe great beast spotted the three Earthmen at the same instant. It\r\nraised itself on its hind legs, and shaking its massive head in anger,\r\nstarted to charge down its own trail toward them.\r\n\r\n\"Disperse!\" cried Connel. \"Take cover!\"\r\n\r\nTom and Roger darted to one side of the trail while Connel dived for the\r\nother. Taking cover behind a tree, the boys turned and pointed their\r\nrifles down the trail. They saw that the tyrannosaurus had already\r\ncovered half the distance between them.\r\n\r\n\"Aim for the legs!\" shouted Connel, from his place of concealment.\r\n\"Don't try for a head shot! He's moving too fast! Give it to him in the\r\nlegs. Try to cut him down!\"\r\n\r\nRoger and Tom lay flat on the ground and trained their rifles on the\r\napproaching beast.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take the right leg,\" said Roger. \"You take the left, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"On target!\" replied Tom, squinting through the sight.\r\n\r\n\"Ready!\" Connel's voice roared across the trail.\r\n\r\nOnly a hundred and fifty feet away the tyrannosaurus, hearing Connel's\r\nvoice, suddenly stopped. Its head weaved back and forth as though it\r\nsuspected a trap.\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" roared Connel.\r\n\r\nTom and Roger fired together, but at the same moment the monster lunged\r\ntoward Connel's position. Both shots missed, the energy charges merely\r\nscorching its sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe tyrannosaurus roared with anger and turned toward the boys, head\r\ndown and the claws of its short forelegs extended.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Connel opened fire, aiming for the monster's vulnerable\r\nneck. But it was well protected behind its shoulders and the spaceman\r\nonly succeeded in drawing the beast's attention back to himself.\r\n\r\nAt this instant Tom and Roger opened fire again, sending violent shock\r\ncharges into the beast's hide. Caught in the withering cross fire, it\r\nturned blindly on the boys and charged at them. The two cadets fired\r\ncoolly, rapidly, unable to miss the great bulk. The air became acrid\r\nwith the sharp odor of ionized air. Maddened now beyond the limits of\r\nits endurance, hit at least twenty times and wild with pain, the great\r\nking of the Venusian jungle bore down on the two cadets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRoger and Tom saw that their fire was not going to stop the\r\ntyrannosaurus's charge. They were pouring a nearly steady stream of fire\r\ninto the monster now, while on the other side of the trail Connel was\r\ndoing the same, raking the monstrous hulk from the forelegs to the\r\nhindquarters.\r\n\r\nThe boys jumped back, Tom still facing the beast and firing his rifle\r\nfrom the waist. But Roger stumbled in the tangle of the underbrush and\r\nfell backward, dropping his rifle. The beast's head swooped low, jaws\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nSeeing Roger's danger, Tom jumped downward again without hesitation and\r\nfired point-blank at the beast's scaly head, only ten feet away.\r\n\r\nThe monster roared in sudden agony and pulled back, jerking his head up\r\nagainst a thick branch of the tree overhead. The limb tore loose under\r\nthe impact and fell crashing to the ground on top of Roger.\r\n\r\nFrom behind, Connel stepped closer to the tyrannosaurus and fired from a\r\ntwenty-five-foot range. It wavered and stumbled back, obviously mortally\r\nwounded. From both sides Tom and Connel poured their weapons' power into\r\nthe giant beast. Blinded, near death, the monster wavered uncertainly.\r\nBellowing in fear and pain, it turned and lumbered back down the trail.\r\n\r\nConnel and Tom watched it until they were certain it could not attack\r\nthem without warning again, and then they hurried to Roger. The heavy\r\ntree limb had landed across his back, pinning him to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Roger!\" yelled Tom. \"Roger, are you all right?\"\r\n\r\nThe blond-haired cadet didn't answer. Grabbing a stout branch lying on\r\nthe ground near by, Connel and Tom worked it beneath the limb which lay\r\nacross Roger's body and pried it up.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it,\" said Connel, holding the weight of the limb on his\r\nshoulder. \"Pull him out!\"\r\n\r\nTom quickly pulled the unconscious cadet clear and laid him on the\r\nground. Dropping the limb, Connel bent down to examine the boy. He ran\r\nhis fingers along Roger's spine, feeling the bones one by one through\r\nthe skin-tight jungle suit. Finally he straightened and shook his head.\r\n\"I can't tell anything,\" he said. \"We'll have to take him back to\r\nSinclair's right away.\" He stood up. \"I'll make a stretcher for him.\r\nMeanwhile, you go after that tyranno and finish him off. He's pretty\r\nfar gone, but you never can tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Tom. He picked up his rifle and reloaded it,\r\nchecking it carefully. He repeated the precaution with Roger's blaster.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up,\" urged Connel, already reaching for a suitable branch. \"Time\r\nmeans everything now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be right back, sir,\" replied Tom. And as he walked away, he looked back\r\nat the unconscious form of his unit mate. He could not help reflecting\r\non the bitter fact that already two members of the expedition were in\r\ndanger, and they were no closer to their goal of finding the\r\nNationalists' hidden base.\r\n\r\nMoving carefully, one of the two rifles slung over his shoulder, the\r\nother in his hand ready for use, Tom followed the trail of the\r\ntyrannosaurus. Two thousand yards farther along he saw a place where the\r\nmonster had fallen and then struggled back to its feet to stagger on.\r\nRounding a turn in the trail, Tom stopped abruptly. Before him, not a\r\nhundred feet away, the beast lay sprawled on the ground. The area all\r\naround was devoid of any vegetation. It was trampled down to the black\r\nsoil. Tom deduced that it was the beast's lair. He pressed forward\r\ncautiously until he was a scant thirty feet away, and crouched between\r\nthe roots of a huge tree where he would be protected should the monster\r\nbe able to rise and fight again.\r\n\r\nSighting carefully on the base of the monster's neck, he squeezed the\r\ntrigger of the shock rifle. A full energy charge hit the tyrannosaurus\r\nin its most vulnerable spot. It jerked under the sudden blast,\r\ninvoluntarily tried to rise to its feet, and then fell back, the ground\r\nshaking under the impact of its thirty tons. Then, after one convulsive\r\nkick with its hind legs that uprooted a near-by tree, the beast\r\nstiffened and lay still.\r\n\r\nTom waited, watching the beast for signs of life. After five minutes he\r\nstepped forward cautiously, his rifle ready. He circled the\r\ntyrannosaurus slowly. The great bulk towered above him, and the cadet's\r\neyes widened in amazement at the size of the fallen giant. Stopping at\r\nits head, which was as wide as he was tall, Tom looked at the jaws and\r\nteeth that had torn so many foes into bloody bits, and shook his head.\r\nHe had come to the jungle to kill just such a beast. But with Astro\r\nmissing and Roger unconscious the thrill of victory was somehow missing.\r\nHe turned and headed back down the trail.\r\n\r\nConnel had finished the litter by the time Tom returned, and the officer\r\nwas leaning over the blond-haired cadet, examining his back again.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better move out right away, Tom,\" said Connel. \"I still can't tell\r\nwhat's wrong. It may be serious, and then it may be nothing more than\r\njust shock. But we can't take a chance.\"\r\n\r\nTom nodded. \"Very well, sir.\" He adjusted his shoulder pack, slung both\r\nrifles over his shoulder, and started to pick up his end of the litter\r\nwhen suddenly the jungle silence was shattered by a deafening roar.\r\nConnel jumped to his feet!\r\n\r\n\"Corbett!\" he cried. \"That's a rocket ship blasting off!\"\r\n\r\n\"It sure sounded like it, sir,\" replied Tom.\r\n\r\n\"And I'll stake my life it's not more than a half mile away!\"\r\n\r\nThe two men jumped out into the trail and scanned the sky. The\r\nunmistakable roar of a spaceship echoed through the jungle. The ship was\r\naccelerating, and the reverberations of the rocket exhaust rolled over\r\nthe treetops. Suddenly a flash of gleaming metal streaked across the sky\r\nand Connel roared.\r\n\r\n\"We've found it, Corbett!\" He slapped the cadet on the back. \"The\r\nNationalists' base! We've found it!\"\r\n\r\nTom nodded, a half-smile on his face. \"We sure have, Major.\" He\r\nhesitated a moment. \"You know, sir, if Roger is really badly hurt we\r\nmight not make it back to Sinclair's in time, so--\" He stopped.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you're thinking, Tom,\" said the officer, \"and I agree. But\r\none of us has to go back with the information.\"\r\n\r\n\"You go, sir,\" said Tom. \"I'll take Roger and--\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't carry him alone--\"\r\n\r\n\"I can make it somehow,\" protested Tom.\r\n\r\nConnel shook his head. \"I'll help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, you're going to allow yourself to be captured too?\"\r\nspluttered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite.\" Connel smiled. \"But a good intelligence agent gets as much\r\ninformation as he can. And he gets correct information! I'll help you\r\nget him to the base and you can take him on in for medical attention.\r\nI'll get back to Sinclair's later.\"\r\n\r\nTom tried to protest, but the burly spaceman had turned away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Stand where you are!\"\r\n\r\nTom and Major Connel stiffened and looked around, the unconscious form\r\nof Roger stretched between them on the litter. From the jungle around\r\nthem, green-clad Nationalists suddenly emerged, brandishing their guns.\r\n\r\n\"Put Roger down,\" muttered Connel quietly. \"Don't try anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Tom, and they lowered the litter to the ground\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\"Raise your hands!\" came the second command from a man who appeared\r\ndirectly in front of them.\r\n\r\nStanding squarely in front of them, the little man said something in the\r\nVenusian dialect and waited, but Connel and Tom remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you don't speak the Venusian tongue,\" he sneered. \"So I'll have\r\nto use the disgusting language of Earth!\" He looked down at the\r\nunconscious form of Roger. \"What happened to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was injured in a fight with a tyrannosaurus,\" replied Connel. \"May I\r\nremind you that you and these men are holding guns on an officer of the\r\nSolar Guard. Such a crime is punishable by two years on a prison\r\nasteroid!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be the one to go to prison, my stout friend!\" The man laughed.\r\n\"A little work in the shops will take some of that waistline off you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you taking us prisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\" Connel seemed to consider for a moment. \"Who are you?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"I am Drifi, squad officer of the jungle patrol.\"\r\n\r\n\"Connel, Senior Officer, Solar Guard,\" acknowledged Connel. \"If we are\r\nbeing held prisoner, I wish to make a request.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prisoners don't make requests,\" said Drifi, and then added\r\nsuspiciously, \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"See that this man\"--Connel indicated Roger--\"is given medical attention\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\nDrifi eyed the major cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"I make this request as one officer to another,\" said Connel. \"A point\r\nof honor between opponents.\"\r\n\r\nDrifi's eyes gleamed visibly at the word _officer_, and Tom almost\r\ngrinned at Connel's subtle flattery.\r\n\r\n\"You--and you,\" snapped Drifi at the green-clad men around them, \"see\r\nthat this man is taken to the medical center immediately!\" Two men\r\njumped to pick up the litter.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Connel. \"Now will you be so kind as to tell me what\r\nthis is all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll find out soon enough. We have a special way of treating spies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spies!\" roared Connel. The officer sounded so indignant that Tom was\r\nalmost fooled by his tone. \"We're hunters! One of our party is lost here\r\nin the jungle. We were searching for him when we were attacked by a\r\ntyrannosaurus. During the fight, this man was injured. We're not spies!\"\r\n\r\nDrifi shrugged his shoulders, and barking a command to his men, turned\r\ninto the jungle. Connel and Tom were forced to follow.\r\n\r\nThey were taken to the giant teakwood that Astro had seen, and Tom and\r\nConnel watched silently as the door opened, revealing the vacuum tube.\r\nThe men crowded into the car and it dropped to the lower level.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same twisting turns in the tunnels, Tom and Connel were\r\nbrought to the armory and saw the men surrender their weapons and change\r\ntheir helmets and shoes. They tried desperately to get a look at the\r\nfaces of the men around them while the headgear was being changed, but,\r\nas before, the men were careful to keep their faces averted.\r\n\r\nContinuing down the tunnel, Connel tried to speak to Drifi again. \"I\r\nwould appreciate it greatly, sir,\" he said in his most formal military\r\nmanner, \"if you could give me any news about the other man of our party.\r\nHave you seen him?\"\r\n\r\nDrifi did not answer. He marched stiffly ahead, not even bothering to\r\nlook at Connel.\r\n\r\nAs they neared the exit, Connel drifted imperceptibly closer to Tom and\r\nwhispered out of the side of his mouth, \"Keep your eyes open for ships.\r\nCount as many as you can. How many are armed, their size, and so on.\r\nLook for ammunition dumps. Check radar and communications installations.\r\nGet as much information as you can, in case only one of us can escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" whispered Tom. \"Do you think they might have Astro?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a good guess. We were following the tyrannosaurus's trail when\r\nthey caught us, and I'm pretty sure Astro had been doing the same\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop that talking!\" snapped Drifi, suddenly whirling on them. \"You,\" he\r\nshouted at one of the guards, \"get up here and keep them apart!\"\r\n\r\nA guard stepped quickly between Tom and Connel, and the conversation\r\nended.\r\n\r\nAt the exit Connel and Tom stopped involuntarily at the sight before\r\nthem. Astro had entered the canyon near twilight, but the two spacemen\r\ngot a view of the Nationalists' base under the full noon sun. Connel\r\ngasped and muttered a space oath. Tom turned halfway to his superior and\r\nwas starting to speak when both were shoved rudely ahead. \"Keep moving,\"\r\na guard growled.\r\n\r\nAs they walked, their eyes flicked over the canyon, alert for details.\r\nTom counted the ships arrayed neatly on the spaceport some distance\r\naway, then counted others outside repair shops with men scurrying over\r\nthem like so many ants. Near the center of the canyon the bare trunk of\r\na giant teakwood soared skyward, a gigantic communications tower. Tom\r\nscanned the revolving antenna, and from its shape and size deduced the\r\npower and type of radar being used at the base. He admitted to himself\r\nthat the Nationalists had the latest and best. Connel was busy too,\r\nnoting buildings of identical design scattered around the canyon floor\r\nthat were too small to be spaceship hangars or storage depots. He\r\nguessed that they were housings for vacuum-tube elevator shafts that led\r\nto underground caves.\r\n\r\nThe canyon echoed with the splutter of arc welders, the slow banging of\r\niron workers, the cough and hissing of jet sleds, the roar of activity\r\nthat meant deadly danger to the Solar Alliance. Connel noticed as he\r\nmoved across the canyon floor that the workers were in good spirits. The\r\nmorale of the rebels, thought the space officer, was good! Too good!\r\n\r\nAt a momentary halt in their march, when Drifi stopped to speak with a\r\nsentry, Tom and Connel found an opportunity to speak again.\r\n\r\n\"I've counted a dozen big converted freighters on the blast ramps, sir,\"\r\nwhispered Tom hurriedly. \"Three more being repaired, nearly finished,\r\nand there are about fifty smaller ships, all heavily armed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That checks with my count, Tom,\" replied Connel hurriedly. \"What do you\r\nmake of the radar?\"\r\n\r\n\"At least as good as we have!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so, too! If a Solar Guard squadron tried to attack this base\r\nnow, they'd be spotted and blasted out of space!\"\r\n\r\n\"What about stores, sir?\" asked Tom. \"I didn't see anything like a\r\nsupply depot.\"\r\n\r\nConnel told him of the small buildings which he believed housed the\r\nelevator shafts to underground storerooms. \"Only one thing is missing!\"\r\nhe concluded.\r\n\r\n\"What's that, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"The nuclear chambers where they produce ammunition for their fleet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be underground too, sir,\" said Tom. \"There isn't a building in\r\nthe canyon that's made of concrete and steel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. Either that, or it's back up there in the cliffs in one of those\r\ntunnels!\" The officer snorted. \"By the stars, Corbett, this place is an\r\natom bomb ready to go off in the lap of the Solar Alliance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we going to do, sir?\" asked Tom. \"So far, it looks as if it's\r\ngoing to be tough to get out again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to wait for a break, Tom,\" sighed Connel.\r\n\r\n\"I hope they've taken good care of Roger,\" said the cadet in a low\r\nvoice. \"And I hope they've got Astro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Watch it,\" warned Connel. \"Drifi's coming back. Remember, if we're\r\nseparated and you do manage to escape, get back to Sinclair's. Contact\r\nCommander Walters and tell him everything that's happened. The code\r\nname for direct emergency contact through Solar Guard communications\r\ncenter in Venusport is Juggernaut!\"\r\n\r\n\"Juggernaut!\" repeated Tom in a whisper. \"Very well, sir. But I sure\r\nhope we aren't separated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well have to take what comes. _Sh!_ Here he comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, let's go,\" said the patrol leader.\r\n\r\nThey continued across the canyon until they reached a four-story wooden\r\nstructure without windows. Drifi opened a small door and motioned them\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" Connel demanded.\r\n\r\n\"This is where you'll stay until Lactu sends for you. Right now, he is\r\nin conference with the Division Leaders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Divisions of what? Ships? Men?\" asked Connel offhandedly, trying not to\r\nshow any more than idle curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"You'll find out when the Solar Guard comes looking for a fight,\" said\r\nDrifi. \"Now get in there!\"\r\n\r\nTom and Connel were shoved inside and the door closed behind them. It\r\nwas pitch black, and they couldn't see an inch in front of their faces.\r\nBut both Tom and Connel knew instantly that they were not alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Come on. Gimme that wrench!\" barked Astro. The little man beside him\r\nhanded up the wrench and leaned over the side of the engine casing to\r\nwatch Astro pull the nut tight. \"Now get over there and throw on the\r\nswitch,\" snapped the big cadet.\r\n\r\nThe little man scurried over to one side of the vast machine shop and\r\nflipped on the wall switch. There was an audible hum of power and then\r\nslowly the machine Astro had just worked on began to speed up, soon\r\nrevving up to ten thousand revolutions per minute.\r\n\r\n\"Is it fixed?\" demanded the shop foreman, coming up beside Astro.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, she's fixed. But I don't work on another job until you give me\r\nanother helper. That asteroid head you gave me doesn't know a--\" Astro\r\nstopped. Something out beyond the double doors caught his eye. It was\r\nthe sight of Tom and Connel entering the wooden building.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with him?\" demanded the foreman.\r\n\r\n\"Huh? What? Oh--ah--well, he's O.K., I guess,\" Astro stammered. \"It's\r\njust that he's a little green, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, get to work on that heater in chamber number one. It's burned a\r\nbearing. Change it, and hurry up about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure--sure!\" The big cadet grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Say, what's the matter with you?\" asked the foreman, staring at him\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"I'm O.K.,\" replied Astro quickly.\r\n\r\nThe foreman continued to stare at Astro as the big cadet turned to his\r\nassistant nonchalantly. \"Come on, genius, get that box of tools over to\r\nthe heater!\" he shouted. As he turned away, the foreman nodded to the\r\ngreen-clad guard, who followed closely behind Astro, his hand on the\r\nbutt of his paralo-ray gun.\r\n\r\nSeeing the little assistant struggling with the heavy box, Astro stopped\r\nand picked it out of his arms with one hand. Grinning, he held it\r\nstraight out and then slowly brought it around in a complete circle over\r\nhis head, still holding it with only one hand. The guard's eyes widened\r\nbehind his plastic helmet at this show of strength.\r\n\r\n\"You're very strong, Astro,\" he said, \"but you are altogether too\r\ncontemptuous of a fellow Venusian.\" He nodded to the small assistant.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said Astro. His grin hardened and he leaned forward\r\nslightly, balancing on the balls of his feet. \"That goes for you and\r\nevery other green space monkey in this place. Drop that ray gun and I'll\r\ntie you up in a knot!\"\r\n\r\nFrightened, the guard pulled the paralo-ray gun out of its holster, but\r\nAstro quickly stepped in and sank his fist deep into the guard's\r\nstomach. The man dropped like a stone. Astro grinned and turned his back\r\nto walk toward the heater. He heard the other workers begin to chatter\r\nexcitedly, but he didn't pay any attention to them.\r\n\r\n\"Astro! Astro!\" His little assistant ran up beside him. \"You hit a\r\ndivision guard!\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, huh?\" replied the big cadet in an innocent tone. \"What kind of a\r\ndivision?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know? Venus has been divided into areas called divisions.\r\nEach division has a chief, and every Venusian citizen in that division\r\nis under his personal jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" said Astro vaguely. He climbed up on to the machine and began\r\ntaking off the outer casing.\r\n\r\n\"The best men in the division are made the Division Chief's personal\r\nguards.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happens to the second and third and fourth best men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're given jobs here according to their knowledge and\r\ncapacities.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was your job before you came here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a field worker on my chief's plantation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you join?\" asked Astro. \"Did you think it better to have\r\nVenusians ruling Venus, instead of belonging to the Solar Alliance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think about it at all,\" admitted the little man. \"Besides, I\r\ndidn't join. I was recruited. My chief just put me on a ship and here I\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think of it, now that you're here?\" asked Astro. He\r\nbegan running his fingers along a few of the valves, apparently paying\r\nno attention to the guard who was just now staggering to his feet.\r\n\r\nThe little assistant paused and considered Astro's question. Finally he\r\nreplied weakly, \"I don't know. It's all right, I guess. It's better here\r\nin the shops than in the caves where the others go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Others? What others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those that don't like it,\" replied the man. \"They're sent to the\r\ncaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"What caves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up in the cliff. The tunnels--\" He suddenly stopped when an angry shout\r\nechoed in the machine shop. The guard Astro had hit rushed up. He turned\r\nto several workmen near by. \"Take this blabbering idiot to the caves!\"\r\nhe ordered angrily.\r\n\r\nAstro slowly climbed down from the machine and faced the guard\r\nmenacingly. As the guard's finger tightened on the trigger of his\r\nparalo-ray gun, the foreman suddenly rushed up and knocked the gun out\r\nof his hand. \"You fool! You stiffen this man and we'll be held up in\r\nproduction for hours!\"\r\n\r\n\"So what!\" sneered the guard.\r\n\r\n\"Lactu and your Division Chief will tell you so what!\" barked the\r\nforeman. He turned to Astro. \"And as for you, if you try anything like\r\nthat again, I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't do a thing,\" said Astro casually. \"I'm the best man you've\r\ngot and you know it. Lactu knows it too. So don't threaten me and keep\r\nthese green space jerks away from me! I'll fix your machines, because I\r\nwant to, not because you can make me!\"\r\n\r\nThe foreman eyed the big cadet curiously. \"Because you want to? You've\r\nchanged your tune since you first came here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Astro. \"Maybe I like what I see around here. It all\r\ndepends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, make up your mind later,\" barked the foreman. \"Now get that\r\nmachine fixed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said Astro simply, turning back to the machine and starting to\r\nwhistle. Strangely enough, he was happy. He was a prisoner, but he felt\r\nbetter than he had in days. Just knowing that Tom and Major Connel were\r\nright across the canyon gave him a surge of confidence. Working over the\r\nmachine quickly, surely, the big cadet began to formulate a plan. Now\r\nwas the time! They were together again. Now was the time to escape!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Put your back against the door, Tom!\" snapped Connel. \"Quickly!\"\r\n\r\nTom felt the powerful grip of the Solar Guard officer's fingers on his\r\narm as he was pulled backward. He closed his eyes, then opened them,\r\nhoping to pierce the darkness, but he saw nothing. Beside him, he could\r\nsense the tenseness in Connel's body.\r\n\r\nThere was a rustle of movement to the right of them.\r\n\r\n\"Careful, Tom,\" cautioned Connel. \"To your right!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear it, sir,\" said Tom, turning toward the noise and bracing\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Connel,\" the burly spaceman suddenly spoke up in loud tones.\r\n\"I'm an official in the Solar Guard! Whoever you are, speak up! Identify\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence and then a voice spoke harshly in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\"How do we know you're a Solar Guard officer? How do we know you're not\r\na spy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any kind of light?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have a light. But we are not going to give away our positions.\r\nWe know how to move in here. You don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you expect me to prove it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The burden of proof lies with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard of me?\" asked Connel after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"We know there is an officer in the Solar Guard named Connel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am that officer,\" asserted Connel. \"I was sent into the jungle to\r\nfind this base, but one of our party was injured and we were captured by\r\na patrol.\"\r\n\r\nTom and Connel heard voices whispering in the darkness and then a loud\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"Lie down on the floor, both of you!\"\r\n\r\nThe two spacemen hesitated and then got down flat on their backs.\r\n\r\n\"Close your eyes and lie still. One of us here knows what Connel looks\r\nlike. I hope for your sake that you're telling the truth. If you're\r\nnot--\" The voice stopped but the threat was plain.\r\n\r\n\"Do as they say, Tom,\" said Connel.\r\n\r\nThe cadet closed his eyes and he heard the shuffle of feet around them.\r\nSuddenly there was a flash of light on his face but he kept his eyes\r\ntightly closed. The light moved away, but he could tell that it was\r\nstill burning.\r\n\r\n\"It's Connel, I think,\" said a high-pitched voice directly over them.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty sure. I met him once in Atom City at a scientific meeting. He\r\nwas making a speech with a Professor Sykes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said Connel, hearing the remark. \"I was there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember meeting a man from Venus wearing a long red robe?\"\r\nasked the high-pitched voice.\r\n\r\nConnel hesitated. \"No,\" he said. \"I only remember talking to three men.\r\nTwo were from Venus and one was from Mars. But neither of the two from\r\nVenus wore a red robe. They wore purple--\"\r\n\r\n\"He's right,\" acknowledged the voice. \"This is Connel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open your eyes,\" said the first voice.\r\n\r\nConnel and Tom opened their eyes and in the light of a small hand torch\r\nthey saw two gaunt faces before them. The tallest of the men stuck out a\r\nbony hand. \"My name is Carson.\" They recognized his voice as the one\r\nthat had spoken first. \"And this is Bill Jensen,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"This is Tom Corbett, Space Cadet,\" said Connel. He glanced around the\r\nroom, and in the weak reflected light of the torch, saw almost fifty men\r\ncrouched against the walls, each of them holding a crude weapon.\r\n\r\n\"You'll understand our caution, Major,\" said Carson. \"Once before we had\r\na plan to escape and a spy was sent in. As you see, we didn't escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither did the spy,\" commented Jensen grimly.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been here?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"The oldest prisoner has been here for three years,\" replied Carson. And\r\nas the other men began to gather around them, Connel and Tom saw that\r\nthey were hardly more than walking skeletons. Their cheeks were hollow,\r\neyes sunk in their sockets, and they wore little more than rags.\r\n\r\n\"And there's no way to escape?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Three guards with blasters are stationed on the other side of that\r\ndoor,\" said Carson. \"There is no other entrance or exit. We tried a\r\ntunnel, but it caved in and after that they put in a wooden floor.\" He\r\nstamped on it. \"Teak. Hard as steel. We couldn't cut through.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why are you being held prisoners?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"All of us joined the Nationalists believing it was just a sort of\r\ngood-neighbor club, where we could get together and exchange ideas for\r\nour own improvement. And when we found out what Lactu and the Division\r\nChiefs were really up to, we tried to quit. As you see, we couldn't. We\r\nknew too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blasted rebels!\" muttered Connel. \"The Solar Guard will cool them off!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid it's too late,\" said Carson. \"They're preparing to strike\r\nnow. I've been expecting it for some time. They have enough ships and\r\narms to wipe out the entire Solar Guard garrison here on Venus in one\r\nattack!\" He shook his head. \"After that, with Solar Guard ships and\r\ncomplete control of the planet--\" He paused and sighed. \"It will mean a\r\nlong, bloody space war.\"\r\n\r\nTom and Connel plied the prisoners with questions and soon began to get\r\na complete picture of the scope of the Nationalist movement.\r\n\r\n\"Lactu and his commanders should be sent to a prison asteroid for life,\"\r\nsaid Carson, \"for what they have done to former Nationalists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hundreds of unsuspecting Venusians have been brought here under the\r\nguise of helping to free Venus. But when they come and recognize what\r\nLactu really intends to do, they want to quit. But it's too late, and\r\nthey're sent to the caves.\"\r\n\r\nTom looked at the gaunt man fearfully. There was something in his voice\r\nthat sent a chill down his spine.\r\n\r\n\"They are driven like cattle into the canyon walls,\" continued Carson.\r\n\"There they are forced to dig the huge underground vaults for storage\r\ndumps. They are beaten and whipped and starved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why aren't you in the caves then?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"Some of us were,\" replied Carson. \"But each of us here owns land and it\r\nis necessary to keep us alive to send back directives to our bankers and\r\nforemen to give aid in one form or another to Sharkey and the Division\r\nChiefs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Connel. \"If you were to die, then your property would be\r\nout of their reach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Carson.\r\n\r\n\"Is Sharkey the real leader of the movement?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe so. But then, no one knows. That's the idea of the\r\nfrosted helmets. If you don't know who a man is, you can liquidate him\r\nwithout conscience. He may be your closest friend, but you would never\r\nknow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The blasted space crawlers!\" growled Connel. \"Well, they'll pay!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a plan?\" asked Carson eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Connel slowly, \"but at least we all have more of a chance\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" asked Carson.\r\n\r\n\"The Solar Guard sent us here to find this base. If we don't return, or\r\nsend some sort of message back within a reasonable time, this jungle\r\nwill be swarming with guardsmen!\"\r\n\r\nCarson looked a little disappointed. \"We shall see,\" he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were three things on Astro's mind as twilight darkened into night\r\nover the canyon. One, he had to find out why Roger wasn't with Tom and\r\nConnel when they were taken into the building; two, he had to figure out\r\na way to contact Tom and Connel; and finally, he had to escape himself,\r\nor help Tom and Connel escape.\r\n\r\nThe big cadet finished the last job in the machine shop. It had taken\r\nvery little time, but the big cadet had lingered over it, trying to find\r\nanswers to his three problems. Around him, the workers were leaving\r\ntheir benches and lathes, to be replaced by still others. A twelve-hour\r\nshift was being used by the Nationalists in their frantic preparations\r\nfor an attack on the Venusport garrison of the Solar Guard. Astro\r\nfinally dropped the last wrench into the tool kit and straightened up.\r\nHe stretched leisurely and glanced over at his guard. The man was still\r\nrubbing his stomach where Astro had hit him, and he watched the big\r\ncadet with a murderous gleam in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"All finished,\" said Astro. \"Where and when do I eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had my way, you wouldn't,\" sneered the guard.\r\n\r\n\"Either I knock off and eat,\" said Astro confidently, \"or I call the\r\nforeman and you talk to Lactu.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feeling pretty big, aren't you?\" growled the guard. \"I haven't\r\nforgotten that punch in the stomach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I hardly touched you,\" said Astro in mock surprise.\r\n\r\nThe guard glared at him, muttered an oath, and turned away. Astro could\r\nsee that he was boiling, almost out of his mind with helpless,\r\nfrustrated anger, and suddenly the young cadet realized how he would be\r\nable to move about the base freely. Grinning, he walked arrogantly in\r\nfront of the guard and out of the shop into the dark Venusian night. It\r\nwas very warm and many of the workers had stripped down to their\r\ntrousers. He passed the open doorway of a large tool shop and glanced\r\ninside. It was empty. The men had apparently gone to eat. He suddenly\r\nstopped, turned to the guard, and growled, \"If you want to settle our\r\ndifferences now, we can step inside.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard hesitated and glared at Astro. \"When I settle with you, big\r\nboy, you'll know about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with right now?\" asked Astro. \"Yellow?\" He turned and\r\nwalked into the tool shop without looking back. The guard rushed after\r\nhim. But the big cadet had carefully gauged the distance between them,\r\nand when he heard the rushing steps of the guard immediately behind him,\r\nhe suddenly spun around, swinging a roundhouse right, catching the guard\r\nin the pit of the stomach again. The man stopped dead in his tracks. His\r\neyes bulged and glazed, and he dropped to the floor like a stone. Astro\r\npulled the man to the corner of the empty shop, removed the plastic\r\nhelmet, and then tied and gagged him. He pulled the helmet over his own\r\nhead, nearly tearing one ear off, grabbed the gun and stepped back\r\noutside. He stood in front of the door and glanced up and down the area\r\nbetween the buildings. Fifty feet away a group of men were working over\r\na tube casing, but they didn't even look up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nStaying in the shadows, he walked down the lane, moving carefully. The\r\nplastic helmet would keep him from being recognized right away, but to\r\ncomplete his plan, he needed one of the green uniforms of the guards.\r\n\r\nDeciding it would be too risky to walk around the base, he crouched\r\nbehind a huge crate of machinery at the head of the lane. Sentries were\r\nconstantly patrolling the area and he was certain that one would pass by\r\nsoon. He only hoped the man would be big enough. Fifteen minutes later\r\nthe cadet heard footsteps in a slow measured tread. He peered around the\r\nedge of the crate and silently breathed a thankful prayer. It was a\r\ngreen-clad guard, and luckily, almost as big as he was.\r\n\r\nCrouching in the shadow of the crate, Astro tensed for the attack. It\r\nhad to be quick and it had to be silent. He couldn't club the guard\r\nbecause of his helmet. He would have to get him around the throat to\r\nchoke off any outcry.\r\n\r\nThe slow steps came nearer and the big cadet raised himself on the balls\r\nof his feet, ready to spring. When the guard's shadow fell across him,\r\nAstro leaped forward like a striking tiger.\r\n\r\nThe guard didn't have a chance. Astro's arm coiled around his throat and\r\nthe cry of alarm that welled up within him died down in a choking gasp.\r\nWithin seconds he was unconscious and the big cadet had dragged him\r\nbehind the crate. He stripped him of his uniform, bound and gagged him\r\nwith his own rags, and crammed him into the crate. Then, protected by\r\nthe helmet and green uniform and carrying the blaster, the cadet stepped\r\nout confidently and strode down the lane.\r\n\r\nHe went directly to the building he had seen Tom and Connel enter, and\r\nwalked boldly up to the guard lounging in front of the door.\r\n\r\n\"You're relieved,\" said Astro in the Venusian dialect. \"They want you up\r\nin the caves.\" The cadet had no idea where the caves were, but he knew\r\nthat they couldn't be near by and it would be some time before an alarm\r\ncould be sounded.\r\n\r\n\"The caves?\" asked the guard. \"Who said so?\"\r\n\r\n\"The chief. He wants you to identify somebody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? Identify someone? I don't understand.\" The guard was puzzled. \"What\r\nsection of the caves?\"\r\n\r\n\"The new section,\" said Astro quickly, figuring there must be a new and\r\nan old section because he had heard a guard refer to the old one.\r\n\r\n\"Up by the jungle tunnels?\"\r\n\r\nAstro nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Must be more of those Solar Guardsmen,\" said the guard, relaxing. \"We\r\nhave two of them in here, another in the hospital, and one of them\r\nworking in the machine shop.\"\r\n\r\nHospital! Astro gulped. That would be Roger. But he dared not ask too\r\nmany questions. \"What's going to happen to them?\" he asked casually.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said the guard, \"but I wish we'd hurry up and attack\r\nVenusport. I'm getting tired of living out here in the jungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too,\" said Astro. \"Well, you'd better get going.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard nodded and started to walk away. Suddenly Astro stiffened. Two\r\nother guards were rounding the corner of the building. He called to the\r\ndeparting guard quickly. \"Who's on duty with you tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maron and Teril,\" replied the guard, and then strode off into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\"So long,\" said Astro, turning to face the two men walking toward him.\r\nHe would have to get rid of them.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Maron, Teril,\" he called casually. \"Everything quiet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the shorter of the two, as they stopped in front of\r\nAstro, \"no trouble tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's trouble now!\" growled Astro. He brought up the blaster\r\nand cocked it. \"Make one wrong move, and you're dead little space birds!\r\nGet over there and open that door!\"\r\n\r\nStunned, both men turned to the door without a protest and Astro took\r\ntheir guns. \"Open up!\" he growled.\r\n\r\nThe men slid the heavy bar back and pushed the door open.\r\n\r\n\"Get inside!\" ordered Astro. The two men stumbled inside. Astro stepped\r\nto the door. \"Tom! Major!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a cry of joy from the blackness within and Astro recognized\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\"Astro!\" roared Connel, rushing up. \"What in the stars--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't talk now,\" said Astro. \"Here. Take these blasters and then tie\r\nthese two up. Close the door, but leave it open a crack. We can talk\r\nwhile I stay outside and keep watch. If there isn't a guard out here, it\r\nmight mean trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said Connel. He took the blasters, tossing one over to Tom.\r\n\"Blast it, I never felt anything so good in my life!\" He closed the\r\ndoor, leaving it open an inch.\r\n\r\n\"Why is Roger in the hospital?\" asked Astro quickly.\r\n\r\nConnel told him of the fight with the tyrannosaurus and Roger's injury,\r\nending with their capture by the patrol.\r\n\r\n\"You know what's going on here, Major?\" asked Astro.\r\n\r\n\"I sure do,\" said Connel. \"And the sooner we blast them, the happier\r\nI'll be.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of us will have to escape and get back to the _Polaris_ to contact\r\nCommander Walters,\" said Astro. \"But they've got radar here as good as\r\nours. That has to be put out of commission or they can blast any\r\nattacking fleet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" said Connel grimly, and turned back into the room.\r\n\"Tom!\" he called.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom, coming up to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Since Astro and I speak Venusian--\" said Connel, and then added when\r\nTom gasped, \"Yes, I speak it fluently, but I kept it a secret. That\r\nmeans you're the one to go. Astro and I will have more of a chance here.\r\nYou escape and return to the _Polaris_. Contact Commander Walters. Tell\r\nhim everything that's happened. We'll give you thirty-six hours to make\r\nit. At exactly noon, day after tomorrow, we'll knock out their radar.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how, sir?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. We'll figure out something. Just get back to the _Polaris_\r\nand tell the Solar Guard to attack at noon, day after tomorrow. If you\r\ndon't and the fleet attacks earlier, or later, they'll be wiped out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about you, sir?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"If you get back in time, we'll be all right. If not, then this is\r\ngood-by. We'll hold out as long as we can, but that can't be forever.\r\nWe're fighting smart, determined men, Tom. And it's a fight to the\r\nfinish. Now hurry up and get into one of those uniforms.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Tom turned back inside to put on the uniform, Connel returned to\r\nAstro outside the door. \"Think we can do it, Astro?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why not, sir,\" replied the big cadet.\r\n\r\nA moment later Tom returned, dressed in one of the guard's green uniform\r\nand wearing a helmet. Carson was with him, similarly clad. \"Astro better\r\nshow me the way out of the base,\" said Tom. \"Carson will stand guard\r\nuntil he gets back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good idea,\" said Connel. Tom and Carson slipped out the door.\r\n\r\n\"All set, Astro?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, there's only one thing wrong,\" replied the big cadet.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know the way out of the base.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you the way out of the base.\"\r\n\r\nAdjusting the plastic helmet over his head, Carson stepped up close to\r\nAstro and Tom and spoke confidently. \"It's very simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I thought we'd have to go fumbling around.\"\r\n\r\nCarson pointed through the darkness. \"Follow this lane straight down\r\nuntil you come to a large repair lock. There's a space freighter on the\r\nmaintenance cradle outside. You can't miss it. Turn left and follow a\r\ntrail to the base of the canyon wall. There are jungle creepers and\r\nvines growing up the side and you can climb them easily.\"\r\n\r\nTom nodded and repeated the directions, then turned to Astro. \"Maybe\r\nyou'd better stay here, Astro. I can make it alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Connel spoke sharply from the doorway. \"Astro speaks Venusian. If\r\nyou're stopped, he can speak for you. You'd give yourself away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Tom. \"I guess that is best. Ready to go, Astro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready,\" replied the big cadet.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Major,\" said Tom, reaching into the doorway to shake hands\r\nwith Connel. \"I'll try my best.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a matter of life and death, Tom.\" Connel's voice was low and\r\nhusky. \"Not our lives, or the lives of a few people, but the life and\r\ndeath of the Solar Alliance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, sir.\" Tom turned to Astro and the two cadets marched off\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThey had no difficulty finding the giant ship on the cradles outside the\r\nrepair shop and quickly turned toward the base of the cliff. Twenty\r\nminutes later they had left the center of activity and were close to the\r\ncanyon wall. They were congratulating themselves on their luck in not\r\nbeing stopped or questioned when suddenly they saw a guard ahead of them\r\non sentry duty.\r\n\r\n\"Ill take care of him,\" whispered Astro. \"You hide here in the shadows,\r\nand when I whistle, you start climbing. Then I'll cover you from there\r\nuntil you get to the top. Got it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" The two cadets shook hands briefly. Each knew that there was no\r\nneed to speak of their feelings. \"Take care of Roger,\" said Tom. \"We\r\ndon't know how badly he's been injured.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see to him,\" said Astro. \"Watch me now and wait for my whistle.\"\r\nHe turned away and then paused to call back softly, \"Spaceman's luck,\r\nTom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same to you, Astro,\" replied Tom, and then crouched tensely in the\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nThe big cadet walked casually toward the sentry, who spotted him\r\nimmediately and brought his gun up sharply, calling a challenge in the\r\nVenusian tongue.\r\n\r\n\"A friend,\" replied Astro in the same dialect.\r\n\r\nThe sentry lowered the gun slightly. \"What are you doing out here?\" he\r\nasked suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Just taking a walk,\" said Astro. \"Looking for something.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked the sentry.\r\n\r\n\"Trying to make a connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"A connection? What kind of connection?\"\r\n\r\n\"This kind!\" said Astro suddenly, chopping the side of his hand down on\r\nthe sentry's neck, between the helmet and his uniform collar.\r\n\r\nThe sentry fell to the ground like a poleaxed steer and lay still. Astro\r\ngrinned, then turned and went whistling off into the darkness. Twenty\r\nfeet away Tom heard the signal and hurried to the base of the cliff. He\r\ngrabbed a thick vine and pulled himself upward, hand over hand. Halfway\r\nup he found a small ledge and stopped to rest. Below him, he could see\r\nAstro hurrying back toward the center of the base. The dim lights and\r\nthe distant hum of activity assured him that so far his escape was\r\nunnoticed. He resumed his climb, and fifteen minutes later the\r\ncurly-haired cadet stood on the canyon rim. After another short rest he\r\nturned and plunged into the jungle.\r\n\r\nTom knew that as long as he kept the planet of Earth over his right\r\nshoulder, while keeping the distant star of Regulus ahead of him, he was\r\ntraveling in the right direction to Sinclair's plantation. He stopped to\r\ncheck his bearings often, occasionally having to climb a tree to see\r\nover the top of the jungle. He ignored the threat of an attack by a\r\njungle beast. For some reason it did not present the danger it had when\r\nhe had first entered the jungle, seemingly years before. Under pressure,\r\nthe cadet had become skilled in jungle lore and moved with amazing\r\nspeed. He kept the blaster ready to fire at the slightest movement, but\r\nfortunately during the first night he encountered nothing more dangerous\r\nthan a few furry deerlike animals that scampered behind him off the\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\nMorning broke across the jungle in a sudden burst of sunlight. The air\r\nwas clear and surprisingly cool, and Tom felt that he could make the\r\nSinclair plantation by nightfall if he continued pushing full speed\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nHe stopped once for a quick meal of the last of the synthetics that he\r\nhad stuffed in his pocket from his shoulder pack, and then continued in\r\na steady, ground-eating pace through the jungle. Late in the afternoon\r\nhe began to recognize signs of recent trail blazing, and once he cut\r\nacross the path Astro had made. He wondered if the trail was one Astro\r\nhad cut while he was lost, or previously. He finally decided to go ahead\r\non his own, since he had managed to come this far without the aid of any\r\nguide markers.\r\n\r\nAs the darkening shadows of night began to spread over the jungle the\r\nyoung cadet began to worry. He had been allowed thirty-six hours to make\r\nit back to the _Polaris_, communicate with Commander Walters, and tell\r\nhim the position of the base, and Tom had to allow time for the Solar\r\nGuard fleet to assemble and blast off, so that it would arrive at the\r\nbase at exactly noon on the next day. He had to reach the Sinclair\r\nplantation before nightfall or the fleet would never make it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly to his left he heard a noisy crashing of underbrush and the\r\nroar of a large beast. Tom hesitated. He could hide; he could fight; or\r\nhe could break to his right and try to escape. The beast growled\r\nmenacingly. It had picked up his scent. Tom was sure it was a large\r\nbeast on the prowl for food, and he decided that he could not waste time\r\nhiding, or risk being injured in a battle with the jungle prowler. He\r\nquickly broke to his right and raced through the jungle. Behind him, the\r\nbeast picked up the chase, the ground trembling with its approach. It\r\nbegan to gain on him. Tom was suddenly conscious of having lost his\r\nbearings. He might be running away from the clearing!\r\n\r\nStill he ran on, legs aching and lungs burning. He charged through the\r\nunderbrush that threatened any moment to trip him. When he was almost at\r\nthe point of complete exhaustion, and ready to turn and face the beast\r\nbehind him, he saw something that renewed his spirit and sent new\r\nstrength through his body. Ahead through the vines and creepers, the\r\nslender nose of the _Polaris_ was outlined against the twilight sky.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the beast behind him, he plunged through the last few feet\r\nof jungle undergrowth and raced into the clearing around the Sinclair\r\nhome. Behind him, the beast suddenly stopped growling, and when Tom\r\nreached the air lock of the _Polaris_, he saw that the beast had turned\r\nback, reluctant to come out of the protection of the jungle.\r\n\r\nTom pulled the air-lock port open and was about to step inside when he\r\nheard a harsh voice coming from the shadow of the port stabilizer.\r\n\r\n\"Just stop right where you are!\"\r\n\r\nTom jerked around. Rex Sinclair stepped out of the shadow, a paralo-ray\r\ngun in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sinclair!\" cried Tom, suddenly relieved. \"Boy, am I glad to see\r\nyou!\" He jumped to the ground. \"Don't you recognize me? Cadet Corbett!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"Mr. Sinclair!\" cried Tom, suddenly relieved_]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I recognize you,\" snarled Sinclair. \"Get away from that air lock\r\nor I'll blast you!\"\r\n\r\nTom's face expressed the confusion he felt. \"But, Mr. Sinclair, you're\r\nmaking a mistake. I've got to get aboard and warn--\" He stopped. \"What's\r\nthe idea of holding a paralo ray on me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not warning anybody!\" Sinclair waved the gun menacingly. \"Now\r\nget over to the house and walk slowly with your hands in the air or I'll\r\nfreeze you solid!\"\r\n\r\nStunned by this sudden turn of events, Tom turned away from the air\r\nlock. \"So you're one of them, too,\" said Tom. \"No wonder we were caught\r\nin the jungle. You knew we were looking for the base.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" snapped Sinclair. \"Get into the house and make it\r\nquick!\"\r\n\r\nThe young cadet walked slowly toward the house. He saw the charred\r\nremains of the burned outbuildings and nodded. \"So it was all an act,\r\neh? You had your buildings burned to throw us off the track. Small price\r\nto pay to remain in the confidence of the Solar Guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" growled Sinclair.\r\n\r\n\"You might be able to shut me up, but it'll take a lot more than a bunch\r\nof rabble rousers to shut up the Solar Guard!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see,\" snapped Sinclair.\r\n\r\nThey reached the house and Tom climbed the steps slowly, hoping the\r\nplanter would come close enough for a sudden attack, but he was too\r\ncareful. They moved into the living room and Tom stopped in surprise.\r\nGeorge Hill and his wife were tied hand and foot to two straight-backed\r\nchairs.\r\n\r\nTom gasped. \"George! Mrs. Hill!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Hill strained against his bonds and mumbled something through the\r\ngag in his mouth, but Tom couldn't understand what he was trying to say.\r\nMrs. Hill just looked at the planter with wide, frightened eyes. The\r\ncadet whirled around angrily. \"Why, you dirty little space rat!\"\r\n\r\nSinclair didn't hesitate. He squeezed the trigger of his paralo-ray gun\r\nand Tom stiffened into rigidity.\r\n\r\nThe planter dropped the ray gun into a chair and leisurely began to tie\r\nthe hands and feet of the immobilized cadet.\r\n\r\n\"Since you can hear me, Corbett,\" said Sinclair, \"and since you are\r\npowerless to do anything about what I'm about to tell you, I'm going to\r\ngive you a full explanation. I owe it to you. You've really worked for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nUnable to move a muscle, Tom nevertheless could hear the planter\r\nclearly. He mentally chided himself at his stupidity in allowing himself\r\nto be captured so easily.\r\n\r\nSinclair continued, \"My original invitation to you and your friends, to\r\nuse my home as a base for your hunting operations was sincere. I had no\r\nidea you were in any way connected with the investigation the Solar\r\nGuard was planning to make into the Nationalist movement.\"\r\n\r\nTom was completely bound now, and the planter stepped back, picked up\r\nthe ray gun, and flipping on the neutralizer, released the cadet from\r\nthe effects of the ray charge. Tom shuddered involuntarily, his nerves\r\nand muscles quivering as life suddenly flowed into them again. He\r\ntwisted at the bonds on his wrists, and to his amazement found them\r\nslightly loose. He was sure he could work his hands free, but decided to\r\nwait for a better opportunity. He glanced at the clock on the wall near\r\nby and saw that it was nine in the evening. Only fifteen hours before\r\nthe Solar Guard must attack!\r\n\r\nSinclair sat down casually in a chair and faced the cadet. George and\r\nMrs. Hill had stopped struggling and were watching their employer.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about the bomb we found on the _Polaris_ on our\r\ntrip to Venus?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I planned that little surprise myself, Corbett,\" said Sinclair.\r\n\"Unfortunately our agents on Earth bungled it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that was pretty stupid. There would have been another\r\nman sent in Major Connel's place, and we were warned that something big\r\nwas in the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, quite so, Corbett,\" said Sinclair. \"But the destruction of the\r\n_Polaris_ would have caused no end of speculation. There would have been\r\nan investigation which would have temporarily removed the spotlight from\r\nthe Nationalist movement. That would have given us ample time to\r\ncomplete our preparations for the attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you knew,\" said Tom bitterly, \"when Major Connel, Roger, Astro,\r\nand I left here that we were going to be captured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was one of the details of the final plan. Personally, I\r\nhoped that you and your nosy major would meet a more dramatic and\r\npermanent end in the jungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Tom, glancing at George and\r\nhis wife. \"And what do Mr. and Mrs. Hill have to do with your scheme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately they discovered who I am, and of course had to be taken\r\ncare of. As to your eventual disposition, I haven't had time to think\r\nabout that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'd better start thinking,\" said Tom. \"And you'd better do a\r\ngood job when you attack the Solar Guard. Perhaps you don't know it,\r\nSinclair, but the whole pattern of the Solar Guard is one of defense. We\r\ndo not invite attack, but are prepared for it. And we have the power to\r\ncounterattack!\"\r\n\r\n\"When we get through with your Solar Guard, Corbett,\" sneered Sinclair,\r\n\"there won't be anything left but smoldering heaps of junk and the dead\r\nbodies of stupid men!\"\r\n\r\nThe buzz of a teleceiver suddenly sounded in another part of the house\r\nand Sinclair left the room quickly. When he was sure the planter was out\r\nof earshot, Tom turned to George and whispered, \"I think I can work my\r\nhands loose. Where can I find a ray gun?\" George began to mumble\r\nfrantically but Tom couldn't understand him, and the sound of returning\r\nfootsteps silenced Hill. The planter strode back into the room,\r\nhurriedly putting on the green uniform of the Nationalists. \"I've just\r\nreceived word of a speed-up in the preparations for our attack,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Soon, Corbett--soon you will see what will happen to the Solar\r\nGuard!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Bring that dirty little space crawler in here!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Strong had never seen Commander Walters so angry. The cords\r\nstood out in his neck and his face was red with fury as he paced up and\r\ndown the Solar Guard office in Venusport. \"A spy,\" he roared. \"A spy\r\nright in the heart of our organization!\" He shook his head.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and two burly Solar Guardsmen entered, saluted, and\r\nturned to flank the doorway, hands on their paralo-ray pistols. The\r\nprivate secretary of E. Philips James shuffled in slowly, followed by\r\ntwo more guards. Walters stepped up to the thin, intense young man and\r\nglared at him. \"If I had my way, I'd send you out to the deepest part of\r\nspace and leave you there!\"\r\n\r\nThe man bit his lip but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your secret base?\" demanded Walters.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied the secretary nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you to intercept this message from Mercury?\" Walters tapped a\r\npaper on his desk. \"Who gave you your orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"I receive orders on an audioceiver in my home,\" answered the man, a\r\nslight quaver in his voice. \"I have never seen my superior.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you followed the Nationalist movement blindly, doing whatever they\r\ntold you, without question, is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _sir_!\" roared Walters.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" corrected the secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you to forge those orders for priority seats on the _Venus\r\nLark_?\"\r\n\r\n\"My superior,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know Major Connel was coming here to investigate the\r\nNationalists?\"\r\n\r\n\"I read the decoded message sent to the Solar Delegate, Mr. James.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you to send men to bomb the _Polaris_?\"\r\n\r\n\"My superior,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"Your superior--your superior!\" Walters' voice was edged with contempt.\r\n\"What else has your superior told you to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great many things,\" said the young man simply.\r\n\r\nWalters studied the thin face and then turned to Captain Strong.\r\n\"There's only one thing to do, Steve. There's no telling how many of\r\nthese rats are inside our organization. Relieve every civilian in any\r\nposition of trust and put in our own man. I'll make a public teleceiver\r\nbroadcast in half an hour. I'm declaring martial law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Strong grimly.\r\n\r\n\"If you hadn't been in the code room when this message from Mercury came\r\nin, we would never have known the Nationalists were trying to get the\r\nMercurians to join them in their attack on us until it was too late.\r\nIt's the only break we've had, so far, learning that the Mercurians are\r\nstill decent, loyal Solar citizens. I hate to think of what would have\r\nhappened if they hadn't warned us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He very nearly got away with it, sir,\" said Strong. \"If I hadn't heard\r\nthe signal for a top-secret message come through on the coding machine,\r\nI never would have suspected him. He tried to hide it in his tunic. He\r\nalso confessed to trying to kidnap the cadets when he heard me tell them\r\nthat a cab would be waiting for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we know now,\" said Walters. He turned to one of the guardsmen.\r\n\"Sergeant, I'm holding you personally responsible for this man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the guard, stepping toward the secretary, but\r\nWalters stopped him and addressed the man.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you one last chance to tell me where your base is and how\r\nmany ships you have,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe secretary looked down at his feet and mumbled, \"I don't know where\r\nthe base is, and I don't know how many ships there are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what does this list we found in your tunic mean?\" snapped Strong.\r\n\"These are the names of ships that have been lost in space.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. That list was sent to me over the audioceiver by my\r\nsuperior. I was to relay it to Mercury should they accept our proposal\r\nto join forces against--\" He stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Get him out of my sight!\" barked Walters.\r\n\r\nThe guards closed in around the little man and he slowly shuffled out of\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how many more there are like him in our organization, Steve?\"\r\nThe commander had turned to the window and was staring out blindly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir,\" replied Strong. \"But I think we'd better be\r\nprepared for trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Walters, turning to the Solar Guard captain. \"What do you\r\nsuggest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since we don't know how many ships they have, where their base is, or\r\nwhen they plan to attack, I suggest putting the Venus squadrons in\r\ndefense pattern A. Meanwhile, call in three additional squadrons from\r\nMars, Earth, and Luna. That way, we can at least be assured of an even\r\nfight.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we don't know if they'll attack here on Venus. Suppose we weaken\r\nEarth's fleet and they attack there?\" Walters paused, looking troubled.\r\nThen he sighed. \"I guess you're right. Put the plan into effect\r\nimmediately. It's the only thing we can do.\"\r\n\r\nAt exactly midnight every teleceiver on Venus was suddenly blacked out\r\nfor a moment and then came into focus again to reveal the grim features\r\nof Commander Walters.\r\n\r\nIn homes, restaurants, theaters, arriving and departing space liners, in\r\nevery public and private gathering place, the citizens of Venus heard\r\nthe announcement.\r\n\r\n\"As commander in chief of the Solar Guard, I hereby place the entire\r\nplanet of Venus under martial law. All public laws are suspended until\r\nfurther notice. All public officials are hereby relieved of their\r\nauthority. A ten P.M. until six A.M. curfew will go into effect\r\nimmediately. Anyone caught on the streets between these hours will be\r\narrested. An attack is expected on the city of Venusport, as well as\r\nother Venusian cities, momentarily. Follow established routine for such\r\nan occurrence. Obey officers and enlisted men of the Solar Guard who are\r\nhere on Venus to protect you and your property. That is all!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the living room of Sinclair's house Tom waited impatiently for the\r\nsound of Sinclair's yacht taking off before attempting to free himself\r\nfrom the rope on his wrists. But when a half-hour had passed with no\r\nsound from outside, he decided not to waste any more time.\r\n\r\nRelaxing completely, the curly-haired cadet began working his wrists\r\nback and forth in the loop of rope. It was slow, painful work, and in no\r\ntime the skin was rubbed raw. George and Mrs. Hill watched him,\r\nwide-eyed. They saw the skin of his wrists gradually turn pink, then\r\nred, as the cadet pulled and pushed at the rope. A half-hour had passed\r\nbefore he felt the rope slipping down over the widest part of his hand.\r\nSlowly, so as not to lose the precious advantage, he pulled with all his\r\nstrength, unmindful of the pain. He heard a sharp gasp from Mrs. Hill\r\nand then felt the rope become damp. His wrists were bleeding. But at the\r\nsame time he felt the rope slipping over his hands. He gave a quick tug\r\nand the rope slipped off and dropped to the floor, a bloody tangle. He\r\nspun around and untied the foreman and his wife quickly, removing the\r\ngags from their mouths gently.\r\n\r\n\"Your wrists!\" cried Mrs. Hill.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about them, ma'am,\" said Tom. He looked at Hill. \"How long\r\nhave you been tied up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just about an hour before you came,\" answered the foreman. \"I found\r\nSinclair in front of a teleceiver in his room. It's in a secret panel\r\nand I didn't know it was there. I waited and heard him talking to\r\nsomeone in Venusian. But he spotted me and pulled a ray gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where he's gone?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I sure wish I did!\" said the burly foreman stoutly. \"I have\r\nsomething to settle with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll have to wait until the Solar Guard is finished with him. Come\r\non!\" Tom started toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Hill.\r\n\r\n\"To the _Polaris_! I've got to warn the Solar Guard of their plans.\r\nThey're going to attack the Venusport garrison and take over Venus!\"\r\n\r\n\"By the stars!\" gasped Mrs. Hill. \"Here I've been feeding that man all\r\nthese years and didn't know I was contributing to a revolution!\"\r\n\r\nTom was out of the door and running toward the _Polaris_ before she had\r\nfinished talking. George followed right behind him.\r\n\r\nAs the cadet raced across the dark clearing one hope filled his\r\nmind--that the _Polaris_ would be in the same condition in which they\r\nhad left it.\r\n\r\nThe port was still open where Sinclair had caught him and he climbed\r\ninside the giant ship quickly. As soon as he entered, he snapped on the\r\nemergency lights and searched the ship carefully. After examining every\r\ncompartment, and satisfied that there was no one aboard, he made his way\r\nback to the radar bridge. There, he saw immediately why Sinclair had\r\nfelt free to leave the ship. All radar and communications equipment had\r\nbeen completely smashed.\r\n\r\nThe young cadet returned to the control deck and called down to George\r\nHill, waiting in the air lock. \"George! Get Mrs. Hill aboard quickly.\r\nWe're blasting off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blasting off?\" the foreman called back. \"But I thought you were going\r\nto contact Venusport!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" replied Tom. \"Sinclair has smashed the communications and the\r\nradar. We'll have to take our information to Venusport in person. I only\r\nhope he's left the rockets and atomic motors alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about using the teleceiver in the house?\" asked the foreman,\r\nclimbing up to the control deck.\r\n\r\n\"Can't take a chance,\" said Tom. \"This is top secret. They might have\r\nthe teleceiver tapped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know how to handle this ship alone?\" asked George, glancing\r\naround at the great control board. \"I don't know anything about a ship\r\nthis size.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can handle it,\" said Tom. \"Get Mrs. Hill aboard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, Tommy,\" said Mrs. Hill, climbing up into the control deck.\r\n\"I have some bandages and salve for your wrists.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no time, Mrs. Hill,\" said Tom. \"We've got to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" she interrupted firmly. \"You just give me your hands. It'll\r\ntake only a minute!\"\r\n\r\nTom reluctantly held out his wrists and Mrs. Hill expertly applied the\r\nsalve and bandaged the cadet's raw wrists. Admittedly feeling better,\r\nTom turned to the master switch and found it missing. For a second panic\r\nseized him, until he remembered that Major Connel had hidden it. He felt\r\nunder the pilot's chair and breathed easier, pulling out the vital\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\"Better get into acceleration chairs,\" said Tom, strapping himself into\r\nhis seat. \"This might be a rough take-off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Watch yourself, Tom,\" cautioned George. \"We aren't afraid for\r\nourselves, but you've got to get to Venusport!\"\r\n\r\n\"If he's left the power deck alone, everything will be O.K.\"\r\n\r\nThe young cadet stretched out a trembling hand and switched on the\r\nautomatic firing control. Then, crossing his fingers, he flipped on the\r\nmain generator and breathed easier as the steady hum surged through the\r\nship. He thought briefly of Astro and Roger, wishing his two unit mates\r\nwere at their stations, and then switched on the power feed to the\r\nenergizing pumps. There was a second's wait as the pressure began to\r\nbuild, and he watched the indicator over his head on the control panel\r\ncarefully. When it had reached the proper level, he switched in the\r\nreactant feed, giving it full D-12 rate. He glanced at the astral\r\nchronometer over his head automatically and noted the time.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by!\" he called. \"Blast off minus five--four--three--two--one\r\n--_zero_!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw the master switch and a roaring burst of power poured into\r\nthe main tubes. The ship bucked slightly, raised itself from the\r\nground slowly, and then suddenly shot upward. In less than a minute\r\nthe _Polaris_ had cleared atmosphere and Tom turned on the\r\nartificial-gravity generators. He made a quick computation on the\r\nplanetary calculator, fired the port steering rockets, and sent the\r\nship in a long arching course for Venusport. Then, unstrapping himself,\r\nhe turned to see how Mr. and Mrs. Hill had taken the blast-off.\r\n\r\nThe foreman and his wife were shaking their heads, still in acceleration\r\nshock, and Tom helped them out of their cushions.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my! Do you boys have to go through this all the time?\" Mrs. Hill\r\nasked. \"It's a wonder to me how a human body can take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel pretty much the same way,\" muttered George.\r\n\r\n\"A cup of hot tea will fix you up fine,\" Tom reassured them, and leaving\r\nthe ship on automatic control, he went into the small galley off the\r\ncontrol deck and brewed three cups of tea. In a few moments the elderly\r\ncouple felt better, and Tom told them of the Nationalists' base and\r\nConnel's plan to wreck the radar station at noon the next day. Both Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Hill were shocked at the scope of the Nationalists' plan.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they bit off more than they could chew when they decided to buck\r\nthe Solar Guard,\" asserted Tom. \"When Commander Walters gets finished\r\nwith them, Sinclair and the rest won't have anything left but memories!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me something, Tom,\" said George, looking at the control panel\r\nthoughtfully. \"Have you figured out how you're going to land this ship\r\nalone and with no radar?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to use the seat of my pants.\" Tom smiled, and turned back to\r\nhis seat. George and his wife looked at each other and quickly strapped\r\nthemselves into their acceleration cushions.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Tom began braking the ship with the nose rockets. It\r\nmade a slow-climbing arc over the spaceport and then settled slowly,\r\ntailfirst. The stern teleceiver was out of order, and the young cadet\r\nhad to rely entirely on \"feel,\" to get the _Polaris_ in safely. He had\r\ncalculated his rate of fall, the gravity of Venus, and the power of the\r\nrockets, and was dropping at a predetermined rate. At the critical point\r\nhe increased power on the drive rockets, continuing to fall slowly until\r\nhe felt the jarring bump of the directional fins touching the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Touchdown!\" he roared triumphantly.\r\n\r\nHe closed the master switch and turned to look at the smiling faces of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hill.\r\n\r\n\"That was fine, Tom,\" said George, \"but I don't want to do it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a scaredy cat, George Hill!\" taunted Mrs. Hill. \"Tom handles\r\nthis ship as if he were born on it.\"\r\n\r\nTom grinned. \"We'd better hurry up. There must be something going on.\r\nThere aren't any lights on here at the spaceport and all the\r\nadministration buildings are dark.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the air lock and swung it open, jumping lightly to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" growled a rough voice. \"Get your hands in the air and stay right\r\nwhere you are!\"\r\n\r\nPuzzled, Tom did as he was told, announcing, \"I'm Space Cadet Tom\r\nCorbett, _Polaris_ unit. I request immediate transportation to Commander\r\nWalters. I have important information for him.\"\r\n\r\nHe was momentarily blinded by the glare of a ring of lights around him,\r\nand when he finally could see, he found himself in the middle of a squad\r\nof Solar Guardsmen in battle dress.\r\n\r\n\"What's the password?\" asked a tough sergeant whose shock rifle was\r\naimed right at Tom's midsection.\r\n\r\n\"Juggernaut!\" replied Tom quietly.\r\n\r\nThe word sent the sergeant into a frenzy of action. \"Peters, Smith, get\r\nthe jet car around here!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's up, Sergeant?\" asked Tom. \"Why is everything so dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"Martial law!\" replied the guardsman. \"Curfew from ten until six.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" gasped Tom. \"It looks as if I just made it!\"\r\n\r\nAs George and Mrs. Hill climbed out of the air lock, a jet car raced up\r\nand skidded to a stop in front of them. A moment later Tom and the\r\ncouple, accompanied by two of the guardsmen, were speeding through the\r\ndark and empty streets of Venusport. The car was stopped once at a\r\nmid-town check point, and Tom had to repeat the password. They picked up\r\nanother jet car, full of guardsmen as escorts, and with the echo of the\r\nexhausts roaring in the empty avenues, they sped to central Solar Guard\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nTom had never seen so many enlisted guardsmen in one spot before except\r\non a parade ground. And he noted with a tinge of excitement that each\r\nman was in battle dress. Arriving at headquarters, they were whisked to\r\nthe top floor of the building and ushered into Commander Walters'\r\noffice. The commander smiled broadly as the young cadet stepped to the\r\nfront of his desk and saluted smartly.\r\n\r\n\"Cadet Corbett reporting, sir,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the office was filled with men; E. Philips James, the Solar\r\nDelegate, Captain Strong, fleet commanders, and officers of the line.\r\n\r\n\"Make your report, Cadet Corbett,\" said Walters.\r\n\r\nTom spoke quickly and precisely, giving full details on the location of\r\nthe base, the approximate number of fighting ships, the armament of\r\neach, the location of supply dumps, and finally of Major Connel's plan\r\nto sabotage the radar at noon the following day. Then, one by one, each\r\nofficial asked him questions pertinent to their tasks. Fleet commanders\r\nasked about the ships' speed, size, armor; Strong inquired about the\r\nstores and supporting lines of supply; Walters asked for the names of\r\nall people connected with the movement. All of these questions Tom\r\nanswered as well as he could.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Walters, \"thanks to Corbett and the others on\r\nthis mission, we have all the information we need to counter the\r\nNationalists. I propose to follow Major Connel's plan and attack the\r\nbase at noon tomorrow. Squadrons A and B will approach from the south\r\nand east at exactly noon. Squadrons C, D, and E will come in from the\r\nnorth and west as a second wave at 1202. The rest of the fleet will go\r\nin from above at 1205. Supporting squadrons are now on their way from\r\nEarth and Mars. Blast off at six hundred hours. Spaceman's luck!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good work, Tom,\" said Strong, when the conference broke up.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"But I can't help worrying about Roger and Astro\r\nand Major Connel. What's going to happen to them, sir?\"\r\n\r\nStrong hesitated. \"I don't know, Tom. I really don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What time is it, Astro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly eleven o'clock, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"All set?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what to do. Move out!\"\r\n\r\nAstro and Major Connel were crouched behind a pile of fuel drums piled\r\nnear the communications and radar building in the heart of the\r\nNationalists' base. Above them, the gigantic tree used as the radar\r\ntower rose straight into the Venusian morning sky.\r\n\r\nAfter helping Tom to escape, Astro had returned to the prison building\r\nfor Connel and was surprised to find the place surrounded by green-clad\r\nNationalist guards. Rather than attempt to release Connel then, Astro\r\nhid and waited for the time set to wreck the radar communications of the\r\nenemy. During the second day, he had successfully eluded the many\r\npatrols looking for him. Once from a hiding place he overheard one of\r\nthe men mention Connel. He took a daring chance and approached the\r\npatrol openly. Speaking the Venusian dialect, he learned that Connel had\r\nescaped. That news sent the cadet on a different game of hide-and-seek\r\nas he prowled around the base searching for the Solar Guard officer. He\r\nhad found him hiding near the radar tower, and they spent the night\r\nclose to the communications building waiting for the time to strike.\r\n\r\nTheir plan was simple. Astro would enter the building from the front,\r\nwhile Connel would enter from the rear. Astro would draw attention to\r\nhimself, and while the guards inside the building were busy dealing with\r\nhim, Connel would come upon them from behind, knock them out of action,\r\nand then destroy the radar equipment.\r\n\r\nThe two spacemen gave no thought to their own safety. They were\r\nconcerned only with accomplishing their objective. Having no way of\r\nknowing whether Tom had made it back to Venusport or whether their\r\ndestruction of the communications center would be of any value, they\r\nnevertheless had to proceed on the assumption that Tom had gotten\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nAstro crawled behind the drums and stopped twenty feet from the door to\r\nwait for several Nationalist officers to leave. They finally got into a\r\njet car and roared away. Astro nodded to the major waiting to edge\r\naround to the rear and then headed for the main entrance.\r\n\r\nConnel saw Astro making his way to the front door and hurried around to\r\ncomplete his part of the mission. He waited exactly three minutes,\r\ngripped his shock rifle firmly, and then crossed over to the rear of the\r\nbuilding and stepped inside.\r\n\r\nOnce inside, the major found it difficult to keep from bursting into\r\nlaughter. The large ground-floor room was a frenzy of brawling, yelling,\r\nshouting Nationalist guards trying to capture the giant cadet. Astro was\r\nstanding in the middle of the floor, swinging his great hamlike fists\r\nmethodically, mowing down the guards like tenpins. Two of them were on\r\nhis back, trying to choke him, while others crowded in from all sides.\r\nBut they could not bring the cadet down. Astro saw Connel, shook\r\nhimself, and stood free.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back!\" roared Connel. \"The first one of you green monkeys that\r\nmakes a move will have his teeth knocked out! Now line up over there\r\nagainst the wall--and I mean fast!\"\r\n\r\nThe sudden attack from the rear startled the Nationalist guards, and\r\nthey milled around in confusion. There was no confusion, however, when\r\nConnel fired a blast over their heads. Astro grabbed a paralo-ray gun\r\nand opened up on the guards. A second later the squad of Nationalists\r\nwere frozen in their tracks.\r\n\r\nOnce the men were no further danger to them, Connel and Astro locked the\r\nfront and rear doors and then raced up the stairs that led to the main\r\nradar and communications rooms on the second floor.\r\n\r\n\"You start at that end of the hall, I'll start here!\" shouted Connel.\r\n\"Smash everything you see!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\" Astro waved his hand and charged down the hall. He\r\nexploded into a room, firing rapidly, and an electronics engineer froze\r\nin a startled pose in front of his worktable. The big cadet gleefully\r\nswung a heavy chair across the table of delicate electronic instruments,\r\nand smashed shelves of vital parts, pausing only long enough to see if\r\nhe had left anything unbroken. He rushed out into the hall again. At the\r\nother end he heard Connel in action in another room. Astro grinned. It\r\nsounded as if the major was having a good time. \"Well,\" thought the big\r\ncadet, \"I'm not having such a bad time myself!\"\r\n\r\nThe next room he invaded contained the radar-control panel, and the big\r\ncadet howled with glee as he smashed the butt of his paralo-ray gun into\r\nthe delicate vacuum tubes, and ripped wires and circuits loose.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stopped, conscious of someone behind him. He spun around,\r\nfinger starting to squeeze the trigger of his gun, and then caught\r\nhimself just in time. Major Connel was leaning against the doorjamb, a\r\nwide grin on his face.\r\n\r\n\"How're you doing?\" he drawled.\r\n\r\n\"Not bad,\" said Astro casually. \"Be a lot of work here, fixing these\r\nthings, eh?\" He grinned.\r\n\r\n\"What time is it?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\nAstro looked at his watch. \"Twenty to twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better clear out of here and head for the jungle.\"\r\n\r\nAstro hesitated. \"You know, sir, I've been thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have an idea, spill it,\" said the major.\r\n\r\n\"How about releasing the prisoners, taking over a ship, and blasting\r\noff?\"\r\n\r\n\"And have the Solar Guard fleet blast us out of the skies? No, sir! Come\r\non, we've got to get moving!\"\r\n\r\n\"We could still try to release Carson and the others,\" said Astro\r\nstoutly.\r\n\r\n\"We can try all right, but I don't think we'll be very successful.\"\r\n\r\nThe two spacemen returned to the first floor of the building and headed\r\nfor the rear door without so much as a look at the line of frozen guards\r\nalong the wall. Once outside, they skirted the edge of the building,\r\nstaying close to the hedge, and then struck out boldly across the canyon\r\nfloor toward the prison building. They were surprised to see that their\r\nsmashing attack had gone unnoticed, and Connel reasoned that the\r\nconstant roar of activity in the canyon had covered the sounds of their\r\nraid.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to hurry, sir,\" said Astro as they turned into the lane\r\nleading to the prison. \"Ten minutes to twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no good, Astro,\" said Connel, suddenly pulling the cadet back and\r\npointing to the building. \"Look at all the guards--at least a dozen of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nAstro waited a second before saying grimly, \"We could try, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a pigheaded idiot!\" roared Connel. \"Nothing will happen to\r\nthose men now, and in five minutes there'll be so much confusion around\r\nhere that we'll be able to walk over and open the door without firing a\r\nshot!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was an explosive roar behind them and they spun around.\r\nOn the opposite side of the canyon three rocket ships were hurtling\r\nspaceward.\r\n\r\n\"They must have spotted our fleet coming in,\" said Connel, a puzzled\r\nfrown on his face.\r\n\r\n\"But how could they?\" asked Astro. \"We knocked out their radar!\"\r\n\r\nConnel slammed his fist into the palm of his hand. \"By the stars, Astro,\r\nwe forgot about their monitoring spaceship above the tower! When we\r\nknocked out the main station here in the canyon, it took over and warned\r\nthe base of the attack!\"\r\n\r\nFrom all sides the canyon reverberated with the roaring blasts of the\r\nNationalist fleet blasting off. Around them, the green-clad rebels were\r\nrunning to their defense posts. Officers shouted frantic orders and\r\nworkers dropped tools to pick up guns. The building that held Carson and\r\nthe other planters was suddenly left alone as the guards hurried to\r\nships and battle stations.\r\n\r\nConnel counted the number of ships blasting off and smiled. \"They don't\r\nstand a chance! They're sending up only two heavy cruisers, four\r\ndestroyers, and about twenty scouts. The Solar Guard fleet will blast\r\nthem into space dust.\"\r\n\r\nAstro jumped up and started to run.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Astro! Where are you going?\" shouted Connel.\r\n\r\n\"To find Roger!\" Astro shouted in reply. \"I'll meet you back here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" shouted Connel, settling back into concealment. There was no\r\nneed to release the planters in the guardhouse now. Connel was satisfied\r\nthat in a few moments the rebellion against the Solar Alliance would be\r\ndefeated. He smiled in prospect of seeing a good fight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Bandit at three o'clock--range twenty miles!\" Aboard the command ship\r\nof the first group of attacking Solar Guard squadrons, Captain Strong\r\nstood in the middle of the control deck and watched the outline of an\r\napproaching Nationalist cruiser on the radar scanner. The voice of the\r\nrange finder droned over the ship's intercom.\r\n\r\n\"Change course three degrees starboard, one degree down on ecliptic\r\nplane,\" ordered Strong calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Tom at the controls.\r\n\r\n\"Main battery, stand by to fire.\" Strong watched the enemy ship closely.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye!\" came the answer over the intercom.\r\n\r\n\"Approaching target!\" called the range finder. \"Closing to fifty\r\nthousand yards--forty thousand--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pleiades_ and _Regulus_,\" Strong called the other two ships of his\r\nsquadron. \"Cut in on port and starboard flanks. Squadron B, stand by!\"\r\n\r\nAbrupt acknowledgment came over the audioceiver as the cruisers deployed\r\nfor the attack.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-three thousand yards, holding course.\" The range-finder's voice\r\nwas a steady monotone.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by to fire!\" snapped Strong.\r\n\r\n\"Two bandits at nine o'clock on level plane of ecliptic!\" came the\r\nwarning from the radar bridge.\r\n\r\nBefore Strong could issue an order countering the enemy move, the voice\r\nof the commander of the _Pleiades_ came in over the audioceiver, \"Our\r\nmeat, Strong, you take care of the big baby!\"\r\n\r\nOn the scanner screen Strong saw the trails of two space torpedoes erupt\r\nfrom the side of the _Pleiades_, followed immediately by two more from\r\nits flanking ship, the _Regulus_. The four missiles hurtled toward the\r\ntwo enemy destroyers, and a second later two brilliant flashes of light\r\nappeared on the scanner. Direct hits on the two destroyers!\r\n\r\n\"Range--ten thousand feet,\" came the calm voice over the intercom,\r\nreminding Strong of the enemy cruiser.\r\n\r\n\"Arm war heads!\" snapped Strong over the intercom, and, on the gun deck,\r\nmen twirled the delicate fuses on the noses of the space torpedoes and\r\nstepped back.\r\n\r\n\"On target!\" called the range finder.\r\n\r\n\"Full salvo--fire!\" called Strong, and turned to Tom quickly.\r\n\"Ninety-degree turn--five degrees up!\"\r\n\r\nThe Solar Guard cruiser quivered under the recoil of the salvo and then\r\nbucked under the sudden change of course to elude the torpedoes fired by\r\nthe enemy a split second later.\r\n\r\nAs the Solar Guard cruiser roared up in a long arc, eluding the enemy\r\ntorpedoes, the Nationalist ship maneuvered frantically to evade the\r\nsalvo of war heads, but Strong had fired a deadly pattern. In a few\r\nseconds the enemy ship was reduced to space junk.\r\n\r\nConcentrating on the control panel, Tom had been too busy maneuvering\r\nthe giant ship to see the entire engagement, but he heard the loud\r\nexulting cries of the gun crew over the intercom. He looked up at\r\nStrong, and the Solar Guard captain winked. \"One down!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here come squadrons C, D, and E, sir,\" said Tom, indicating the radar.\r\n\"Right on time.\" He glanced at the astral chronometer over his head.\r\n\"Two minutes after twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't look as if we'll need them, Tom,\" said Strong. \"The\r\nNationalists got only two cruisers and four destroyers off the ground.\r\nWe've already knocked out one of their cruisers and two destroyers, and\r\nSquadron B is taking on the second cruiser and its destroyer escorts\r\nnow!\" He turned to the radar scanner and saw the white evenly spaced\r\nblips that represented Squadron B enveloping the three enemy ships. The\r\nbulky converted cruiser was maneuvering frantically to get away. But\r\nthere was no escape. In a perfectly co-ordinated action the Solar Guard\r\nships fired their space torpedoes simultaneously. The three Nationalist\r\nships exploded in a deadly flash of fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me that's all they've got!\" exclaimed Strong. \"Why, we\r\nstill have the rest of the fleet coming in at 1205!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tom froze in his seat. Before him on the radar scanner he saw a\r\nnew cluster of white blips, seemingly coming from nowhere. They were\r\nenemy ships, hurtling spaceward to meet the Solar Guard fleet. \"Captain\r\nStrong! Look! More of them. From secret ramps in the jungle!\"\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" roared the Solar Guard captain. \"Attention!\r\nAttention! All ships--all ships!\" he called into the fleet intercom.\r\n\"This is Strong aboard command ship. Bandit formation closing fast.\r\nRegroup! Take tight defensive pattern!\"\r\n\r\nAs the Solar Guard squadrons deployed to meet this new attack, Tom felt\r\na chill run down his spine. The mass of ships blasting to meet them\r\noutnumbered them by almost three to one. And there were more ships\r\nblasting off from the secret ramps in the jungle! He had led the Solar\r\nGuard into a trap!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fire at will! Fire at will!\"\r\n\r\nAboard the command ship, Captain Strong roared the order to the rest of\r\nthe fleet, and the individual ship commanders of the Solar Guard vessels\r\nbroke formation and rocketed into the mass of Nationalist ships, firing\r\nsalvo after salvo of space torpedoes. But it was a losing battle. Time\r\nand again, Strong and Tom saw Solar Guard ships hemmed in by three and\r\nfour Nationalists' vessels, then blasted into oblivion.\r\n\r\nStrong had ordered Tom to maneuver the command ship at will, seeking\r\ntargets, yet still keeping from being a target, and the young cadet had\r\nguided the powerful ship through a series of maneuvers that had even\r\nsurprised the experienced Solar Guard officer.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the rest of the fleet?\" roared Strong. \"Why aren't they here\r\nyet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir,\" replied Tom, \"but if they don't show up soon, there\r\nwon't be much left to save!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bandits dead ahead,\" droned the voice from the radar bridge calmly,\r\n\"trying to envelop us.\"\r\n\r\nTom's hand shot out for the intercom to relay orders to the power deck\r\nand glanced quickly at the scanner. He almost cheered. \"Steve--I mean,\r\nCaptain Strong. The rest of the fleet! It's coming in! Attacking from\r\ntop-side!\"\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna, you're right!\" yelled the young Solar Guard\r\ncaptain, as he saw the white blips on the scanner screen. \"O.K., it's\r\ntime to stop running and fight!\"\r\n\r\nThe Solar Guard reinforcements swooped down on the fighting ships with\r\ndazzling speed, and the sky over the jungle belt of Venus base was so\r\nthick with zooming, firing, maneuvering ships that observers on the\r\nground couldn't tell one ship from another. For an hour the battle\r\nraged. During the seesawing back and forth it seemed as if all ships\r\nmust be blasted into space junk. Finally the superior maneuvering and\r\nover-all spacemanship of the Solar Guard vessels began to count heavily,\r\nand the Nationalist ships began to plunge into the jungle or drift\r\nhelplessly out into space. Reforming, the Solar Guard ships encircled\r\nthe enemy in a deadly englobement pattern, and wheeling in great\r\nco-ordinated arcs through space, sent combined volleys of torpedoes\r\ncrashing into the enemy ships. The space battle was over, a complete\r\nSolar Guard victory.\r\n\r\nStrong called to the remaining ships of his fleet, \"Take formation K.\r\nLand and attack the enemy base according to prearranged order. The enemy\r\nfleet is destroyed, but we still have a big job to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happens now, sir?\" asked Tom, relaxing for the first time since\r\nthe space battle had begun.\r\n\r\n\"We try to destroy their base and put an end to this rebellion as\r\nquickly as possible,\" replied Strong coldly.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the ships of the Solar Guard fleet landed around the rim of\r\nthe canyon base. Troop carriers, that had stood off while the space\r\nbattle raged, disgorged hundreds of tough Solar Guard Marines, each\r\ncarrying shock rifles, paralo-ray pistols, and small narco grenades\r\nthat would put an enemy to sleep in five seconds. A half-hour later,\r\nafter the last Nationalist ship had been blasted out of the skies, the\r\nrim of the canyon was alive with Solar Guardsmen waiting to go into\r\naction. Many had comrades in the Solar Guard ships lost in the space\r\nfight and they were eager to avenge their friends.\r\n\r\n\"How many ships did we lose, sir?\" asked Tom, after the squadron\r\ncommanders had made their reports to Captain Strong.\r\n\r\n\"Forty,\" said Strong grimly. \"But the entire Nationalist fleet was wiped\r\nout. Thank the universe that their radar was knocked out, or we would\r\nhave been completely wiped out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank Astro and Major Connel for that, sir,\" said Tom with the first\r\nsmile on his face in days. \"I knew none of those green jokers could stop\r\nthose two!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to report to Commander Walters and the Solar Alliance, Tom.\r\nYou take a squad of men and move out. Your job is to find Astro, Roger,\r\nand Major Connel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir!\" said Tom happily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDown in the canyon, Major Connel had waited as long as he dared for\r\nAstro to return with news of Roger. From his position, the tough\r\nspaceman could not tell how the gigantic space battle had ended until he\r\nsaw the Solar Guard troop carriers land on the rim of the canyon above.\r\nSatisfied, he decided that it was time to move.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Solar Guard troops landed on the rim of the canyon_]\r\n\r\nHe stood up, careful not to expose himself, since fighting had broken\r\nout among the workers. Every street, shop, and corner would bring\r\ndangers, and having stayed alive this far, Connel wanted to reach the\r\nSolar Guard forces and continue the fight alongside his friends. Astro\r\nwas nowhere in sight when the major moved cautiously down a side\r\nalley, and he was beginning to think that Astro had not escaped from the\r\nbase with Roger, when he saw the big cadet suddenly appear around a\r\ncorner running as hard as he could. A few seconds later three green-clad\r\nNationalist guards rounded the corner and pounded after him.\r\n\r\nAstro saw Connel and ducked behind an overturned jet car, yelling, \"I'm\r\nunarmed! Nail them, Major!\"\r\n\r\nIn a flash Connel dropped to the pavement, and firing from a kneeling\r\nposition, cut the Nationalists down expertly. When the last of the enemy\r\nwas frozen, Connel rushed to Astro's side.\r\n\r\n\"What about Roger?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't reach him,\" replied Astro. \"The sick bay's in the main\r\nadministration building and that's so well guarded it would take a full\r\ncompany to break in.\"\r\n\r\nConnel nodded grimly. \"Well, the best thing for us to do is get more men\r\nand then tackle it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Astro. \"I think we'd better head for the canyon walls\r\non the west. The Marines are pouring down that side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" grunted the major, and led the way down the narrow lane. But\r\nwhen they reached the open area beyond the repair shops they saw that\r\nthe Nationalist guards had thrown up barriers in the streets and were\r\npreparing defenses against frontal assault.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we'd better stay where we are, sir,\" the big cadet said, after\r\nscanning the Nationalist defenses. \"We'd never be able to get through\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ummmh,\" mused Connel. \"You're right. Maybe we can be of more use\r\nstriking behind the lines.\"\r\n\r\nAstro grinned. \"That's just what I was thinking, sir.\" He pointed to a\r\nnear-by barrier set up in the middle of the street. \"We could pick off\r\nthe men behind that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" roared Connel. Behind them, five Nationalist guards had\r\nsuddenly appeared. But they were more surprised than Astro and Connel,\r\nand the big cadet took advantage of it by charging right into them.\r\n\r\nIt was a short but vicious fight. There was no time to aim or fire a\r\nparalo-ray gun. It was a matter of bare knuckles and feet and knees and\r\nshoulders. One by one, the green-clad men were laid low, and finally,\r\nConnel, out of breath, turned to grin at Astro.\r\n\r\n\"Feel better,\" he gasped, \"than I've felt in weeks!\"\r\n\r\nAstro grinned. One of Connel's front teeth was missing. Astro leaned\r\nagainst the wall and pointed to the canyon wall where the columns of\r\nSolar Guard Marines were making their way down into the base under heavy\r\ncovering fire from above. \"Won't be long now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said Connel. \"They'll probably send scouts out ahead of those\r\ncolumns and we can make contact with them over there.\" He pointed toward\r\na high tangle of barbed wire set up in the middle of the near-by street.\r\nAstro nodded, and exchanging his broken ray gun for one belonging to a\r\nfallen Nationalist, raced to the edge of the barrier with the major.\r\nThey crouched and waited for the first contact by the Marines.\r\n\r\n\"They shouldn't be too long now,\" said Connel.\r\n\r\n\"No more than a minute, sir,\" said Astro, pointing to a running figure\r\ndarting from one protective position to another.\r\n\r\n\"You, there!\" shouted a familiar voice. \"Behind that barrier!\"\r\n\r\nAstro glanced at Connel. \"Major, that sounds like--!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come out with your hands in the air and nothing will happen to you!\"\r\nthe voice called again.\r\n\r\n\"By the stars, you're right!\" yelled Connel. \"It's Corbett!\"\r\n\r\nAstro jumped up and yelled, \"Tom! Tom! You big space-brained jerk! It's\r\nme, Astro!\"\r\n\r\nBehind the corner of a house, Tom peered cautiously around the edge and\r\nsaw the big cadet scramble over the tangle of barbed wire with Connel\r\nright behind him. Tom held up his hand for the squad in back of him to\r\nhold their fire and stepped out to meet his friends. \"Major! Astro!\"\r\n\r\nThe three spacemen pounded each other on the back while the patrol of\r\nMarines watched, grinning. \"Where's Roger?\" asked Tom finally.\r\n\r\nAstro quickly told him of the heavily guarded administration building.\r\n\r\n\"Is he all right?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"No one knows,\" replied Connel. \"We haven't been able to get any news of\r\nhim at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going after him,\" said Tom, his jaw set. \"No telling what they'll\r\ntry to do with him when they see their goose is cooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with you,\" said Astro.\r\n\r\n\"No, you stay here with Major Connel,\" said Tom. \"I think it would be\r\nbetter if just one tried it, with the rest creating a diversion on the\r\nother side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good idea,\" said Connel. He turned to the rest of the patrol. \"Men,\r\nthere's an injured Space Cadet in the sick bay of the main building.\r\nHe's the third member of the _Polaris_ unit and has contributed as much\r\nto victory in this battle as any of us. We've got to get him out of the\r\nhands of the Nationalists before something happens to him. Are you\r\nwilling to try?\"\r\n\r\nThe Marines agreed without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Connel, \"here's what we'll do.\" Quickly the major\r\noutlined a plan whereby Tom would sneak through the lines of the\r\nNationalists around the administration building, while the rest of them\r\ncreated a diversionary move. It was a daring plan that would require\r\nsplit-second timing. When they were all agreed as to what they would do\r\nand the time of the operation was set, they moved off toward the\r\nadministration building. The rebellion was over, defeated. Yet the\r\nNationalist leaders were still alive. They were desperate men and Roger\r\nwas in their hands. His life meant more to Tom Corbett and Astro than\r\nthe smashing victory of the Solar Guard, and they were prepared to give\r\ntheir own lives to save his.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ready?\" asked Connel.\r\n\r\n\"All set, sir,\" replied Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, we'll open up in exactly five minutes and we'll continue to\r\nattack for another seven minutes. That's all the time you have to get\r\ninside, find Roger, and get out again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, sir,\" replied Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Move out,\" said Connel, \"and spaceman's luck!\"\r\n\r\nWith a last quick glance at Astro who gave him a reassuring nod, Tom\r\ndropped to his knees and crawled out from behind their hidden position.\r\nDropping flat on his stomach, he inched forward toward the\r\nadministration building. All around him ray guns and blasters were\r\nfiring with regularity as the columns of Marines advanced from all sides\r\nof the canyon toward the center, mopping up everything in front of them.\r\nThe roof of the administration building seemed a solid sheet of fire as\r\nthe Nationalist leaders fought back desperately.\r\n\r\nHe reached the side of the building that was windowless, and scrambled\r\ntoward the back door without interference. There he saw five green-clad\r\nmen, crouched behind sandbags, protecting the rear entrance. Glancing at\r\nhis watch he saw the sweeping hand tick off the last few seconds of his\r\nallotted time. At the exact instant it hit the five-minute mark, there\r\nwas a sudden burst of activity at the front of the building. Connel and\r\nthe Marine patrol had opened fire in a mock attack. The men guarding the\r\nrear left their barricade and raced into the building to meet the new\r\nassault.\r\n\r\nWithout a second's hesitation, Tom jumped toward the door. He reached\r\nup, found it unlocked, and then with his ray gun ready, kicked the door\r\nopen. He rushed in and dived to the floor, ray gun in his hand, ready to\r\nfreeze anything or anyone in sight.\r\n\r\nThe hall was empty. In the front, the firing continued and the halls of\r\nthe building echoed loudly with the frantic commands of the defenders.\r\nGliding along the near wall, Tom moved slowly forward. Before him, a\r\ndoor was ajar and he eased toward it. On tiptoe the curly-haired cadet\r\ninched around the edge of the door and glanced inside. He saw a\r\nNationalist guard on his hands and knees loading empty shock rifles. Tom\r\nquickly stepped inside and jammed his gun in the man's back. \"Freeze!\"\r\nhe said between his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe trooper tensed, then relaxed, and slowly raised his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the sick bay?\" demanded Tom.\r\n\r\n\"On the second floor, at the end of the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that where you're keeping Cadet Manning?\" demanded Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the man. \"He's--\"\r\n\r\nTom fired before the trooper could finish. It was rough, but he knew he\r\nhad to act swiftly if he was to help Roger. The trooper was frozen in\r\nhis kneeling position, and Tom scooped up a loaded shock rifle before\r\nslipping back into the hall. It was still empty. The firing outside\r\nseemed to be increasing.\r\n\r\nHe located the stairs, and after a quick but careful check, started up,\r\nheart pounding, guns ready. On the second floor he glanced up and down\r\nthe hall, and jumped back into the stair well quickly. Firing from an\r\nopen window, three troopers were between him and the only door at the\r\nend of the hall. Not sure if Roger was in that room or not, Tom had to\r\nmake sure by looking. And the only way he could do that was to eliminate\r\nthe men in his way. He dropped to one knee and took careful aim with the\r\nray pistol. It would be tricky at such long range, but should the\r\nparalo-ray fail, the cadet was prepared to use the shock rifle. He\r\nfired, and for a breathless second waited for the effects of the ray on\r\nthe troopers. Then he saw the men go rigid and he smiled. Three hundred\r\nfeet with a ray pistol was very fancy shooting!\r\n\r\nHe raced for the door. As he entered the room, he saw a figure stretched\r\nout on the floor. He stopped still, cold fear clutching at his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Roger!\" he called. The blond-haired cadet didn't move. Tom jumped to\r\nhis unit mate's side and dropped to one knee beside him. It was dark in\r\nthe room and he couldn't see very well, but there was no need for light\r\nwhen he felt Roger's pulse.\r\n\r\n\"Frozen, by the stars!\" he exclaimed. He stepped back, flipped the\r\nneutralizer switch on his ray gun, and fired a short burst. Almost\r\nimmediately Roger groaned, blinked his eyes, and sat up.\r\n\r\n\"Roger! Are you all right?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--sure. I'm O.K.,\" mumbled his unit mate. \"Those dirty space rats.\r\nThey didn't know what to do with me when the Marines landed, so they\r\nfroze me. They were scared to kill me. Afraid of reprisals.\"\r\n\r\n\"They sure used their heads that time,\" said Tom with a grin. \"How's\r\nyour back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. I just wrenched it a little. It's better now. But never mind me.\r\nWhat's going on? Where's Astro and Major Connel? And how did you get\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nTom gave him a quick run-down on everything that had happened,\r\nconcluding with, \"Major Connel and Astro, with a patrol of Solar Guard\r\nMarines, are outside now drawing the Nationalist fire. Time's running\r\nout on us fast. Think you can walk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Spaceboy,\" replied Roger, \"to get out of this place I'd crawl on my\r\nhands and knees!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come on!\" Tom gave the shock rifle to his unit mate and stepped\r\nback into the hall. It was quiet. Tom waved at Roger to follow and\r\nslipped down the hall toward the stairs. Outside, the Marine patrol\r\ncontinued firing, never letting up for a second. The two boys reached\r\nthe stairs and had started down when Tom grabbed Roger by the arm.\r\n\"There's someone moving around down there!\"\r\n\r\nThey hugged the wall and held their breath. Tom glanced at his watch.\r\nOnly forty-five seconds to go before the Marines would stop firing and\r\nretire. They had to get out of the building!\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to take a chance, Roger,\" murmured Tom. \"We'll try to rush\r\nthem and fight our way out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother!\" said a harsh voice behind them. The two cadets spun\r\naround and looked back toward the second floor. Standing at the top of\r\nthe stairs, Rex Sinclair scowled down at them, ray guns in each hand,\r\nleveled at the two cadets.\r\n\r\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" cried Roger. \"You!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's one of the things I forgot to tell you, Roger,\" said Tom wryly.\r\n\"Sinclair belongs to this outfit too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Belongs!\" roared Roger. \"Look at that white uniform he's wearing! This\r\nyellow rat is Lactu, the head of the whole Nationalist movement!\"\r\n\r\nTom gaped at the white-clad figure at the head of the stairs. \"The\r\nleader!\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, Corbett,\" replied Sinclair quietly. \"And if it hadn't been\r\nfor three nosy cadets, I would have been the leader of the whole planet.\r\nBut it's finished now. All that is left for me is escape. And you two\r\nare going to help me do just that!\"\r\n\r\nRoger suddenly dropped to one knee and leveled the blaster. But the\r\nNationalist leader was too quick. His paralo-ray crackled and Roger was\r\nfrozen solid.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you--!\" roared Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Drop your gun, Corbett,\" warned Sinclair, \"and take that blaster away\r\nfrom him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get you, Sinclair,\" said Tom through clenched teeth, \"and when I\r\ndo--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop the talk and get busy!\" snapped Sinclair.\r\n\r\nTom took the blaster out of Roger's paralyzed hands and dropped it on\r\nthe floor. Still holding one ray gun on Tom, Sinclair flipped on the\r\nneutralizer of the other gun and released Roger again.\r\n\r\n\"Now get moving down those stairs!\" ordered Sinclair. \"One more funny\r\nmove out of either of you and I'll do more than just freeze you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n\"As I said, you are going to help me escape. This time the Solar Guard\r\nhas won. But there are other planets, other people who need strong\r\nleadership and who like to put on uniforms and play soldier. People will\r\nalways find reason to rebel against authority, and I will be there to\r\nchannel their frustrations into my own plans. Perhaps it will be Mars.\r\nOr Ganymede. Or even Titan. Another name, another plan, and once again\r\nthe Solar Guard will have to fight me. Only next time, I assure you, it\r\nis I who will win!\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be any next time,\" growled Roger. \"You're washed up now.\r\nThis base is swarming with Marines. How do you think you're going to get\r\nout of here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see, my friend. You shall see!\"\r\n\r\nSinclair motioned them toward a door on the ground floor. \"Open it!\"\r\ndemanded Sinclair. Tom opened it and stepped inside. It was a cleaner's\r\ncloset, crammed with old-fashioned mops and pails and dirty rags.\r\nSinclair pushed Roger inside and was about to follow when several\r\ngreen-clad guards came running down the hall toward them.\r\n\r\n\"Lactu! Lactu!\" they shouted frantically. \"They're pouring into the\r\nbase! The Solar Guard--they've got us surrounded!\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep fighting!\" snapped Sinclair. \"Don't surrender! Inflict as much\r\ndamage as possible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where--where are you going?\" asked one of the men, looking at the\r\ncloset speculatively.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind me!\" barked Sinclair. \"Do as I tell you. Fight back!\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks like we're losing a leader,\" observed another of the men\r\nslowly. \"You wouldn't be running out on us, would you, Lactu?\"\r\n\r\nSinclair fired three quick blasts from the ray guns, freezing the men\r\nsolid, and then turned back to Tom and Roger. \"Stay in that closet and\r\ndo as I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nInside the closet, Sinclair kicked a pail out of the way and barked,\r\n\"Remove the loose plank in the floor and drop it on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nTom felt around until he found the loose board and lifted it up.\r\n\r\n\"What's down there?\" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see,\" said Sinclair. \"Now step back, both of you!\"\r\n\r\nTom and Roger backed up and watched while Sinclair bent over the hole\r\nin the floor. He felt around inside with one hand and appeared to turn\r\nsomething. Suddenly the wall opposite the two cadets slid back to reveal\r\na narrow flight of stairs leading down. Sinclair motioned with his gun\r\nagain. \"Get going, both of you.\"\r\n\r\nTom stepped forward, followed by Roger, and they started down the\r\nstairs. At the bottom they found themselves in a narrow tunnel about\r\nfour hundred feet underground. The floor of the tunnel slanted downward\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"At the end of this tunnel,\" announced Sinclair, \"is a clearing and in\r\nthat clearing is a spaceship. It is nearly three miles from the canyon.\r\nBy the time the Solar Guard learns of my absence, we shall be lost in\r\nspace.\"\r\n\r\n\"We?\" asked Tom. \"You're taking us with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But of course,\" said Sinclair. \"How else would I assure myself that\r\nthe Solar Guard will not harm me unless I take two of their most honored\r\nSpace Cadets with me?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It's been fifteen minutes,\" announced Connel, \"and they haven't come\r\nout yet. There's only one thing to do. Take that building and find out\r\nwhat's happened.\"\r\n\r\nThe major was crouched behind a wrecked jet car, staring at the\r\nadministration building.\r\n\r\n\"I can get that Marine captain over to our left to co-ordinate an attack\r\nwith us, sir,\" suggested Astro.\r\n\r\n\"It's risky,\" said Connel. \"They still have a lot of men in there. But\r\nif we wait for another column to reach us, it might be too late. All\r\nright, Astro, tell him we're attacking in ten minutes and ask him to\r\ngive us all the help he can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Astro, and flopped to the ground to worm his way\r\ntoward the head of the Marine column on the left.\r\n\r\nIt took the cadet nearly five minutes to cover the hundred yards between\r\nthe two Solar Guard positions. Several times the firing became so heavy\r\nthat the cadet was forced to remain still on the ground while rifle and\r\nray-gun fire crackled over his head. He made it finally, several Marines\r\ncoming out to help him over the top of the barrier. Gasping for breath,\r\nthe big cadet asked to see the commanding officer.\r\n\r\nA grimy, tired-looking officer turned and walked over to the cadet.\r\n\r\n\"Astro!\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Strong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's Tom and Roger and Major Connel?\" demanded Strong.\r\n\r\nAstro told the captain of Tom's attempt to save Roger and that nothing\r\nhad been heard from him since. \"Major Connel wants us to attack\r\ntogether,\" Astro continued. \"He's jumping off in four minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" snapped Strong. He turned to a young Solar Guard officer\r\nwaiting respectfully near by. \"You take them in, Ferris. Full frontal\r\nattack. Don't use blasters unless you have to. Take as many prisoners as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go back to the other position with Cadet Astro. Start your attack\r\nas soon as you see Major Connel and his men go in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got it, sir,\" said the lieutenant.\r\n\r\nStrong and Astro made their way back to Connel's position quickly, and\r\nafter a brief but hearty handclasp, the two officers began plotting the\r\nlast assault against the Nationalists' stronghold. While other Marine\r\ncolumns were wiping up small groups of rebels fighting from disabled\r\nspaceships, repair shops, and other buildings, Strong's column had been\r\ndriving straight for the heart of the base. The administration building\r\nwas the last barrier between them and complete victory over the rebels.\r\n\r\nStrong and Connel spoke briefly of Tom and Roger, neither wanting to\r\nvoice his inner fears in front of Astro. The Nationalists previously had\r\nshown little regard for human life. Now, with their backs to the wall,\r\nConnel and Strong knew that if Tom and Roger were captured, they might\r\nbe used as hostages to ensure safe passage for some of the rebels.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" said Connel finally. \"Tom and Roger will be expecting us.\"\r\nHe forced himself to grin at Astro, but the giant cadet turned and faced\r\nthe building grimly. Connel lifted his hand, took a last look up and\r\ndown the line of waiting Marines, then brought his hand down quickly.\r\n\"Over the top. Spaceman's luck!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe Marines vaulted over the top of their defense position and charged\r\nmadly toward the building, all guns blazing. The Nationalists returned\r\nthe fire, and for the first few seconds it seemed that the world had\r\nsuddenly gone mad. Strong found himself shouting, running, and firing in\r\na red haze. Astro was roaring at the top of his lungs, and Connel just\r\ncharged ahead blindly. Marines began to drop on all sides, cut down by\r\nthe withering fire. Then, when it appeared that they would have to fall\r\nback, the main column, led by the Solar Guard lieutenant, broke through\r\nthe last barricade and swarmed into the building.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the battle was over. The last remnants of the\r\nNationalists had been defeated and the green-clad troopers were herded\r\ninto the streets like cattle. Strong and Connel, followed by Astro,\r\ncharged through the building like wild bulls searching for Tom and\r\nRoger.\r\n\r\n\"No sign of them,\" said Strong finally. \"They must have slipped out\r\nsomehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" roared Connel. \"They've been taken out of here as hostages. I'll\r\nbet my life on that. There must be a secret way out of here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said Strong. \"Let's find it.\" Suddenly he stopped. \"Look!\r\nThose three troopers outside that door! They're frozen! Let's have a\r\nlook there first!\"\r\n\r\nThey rushed over to the closet where the three Nationalists had been\r\nfrozen by Sinclair.\r\n\r\nStrong stopped and gasped. \"By the craters of Luna, it's Sharkey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sharkey? Who's that?\" asked Astro.\r\n\r\n\"Supposed to be the leader of the Nationalists,\" said Connel.\r\n\r\nStrong quickly released Sharkey from the paralo-ray effects and the man\r\nshuddered so violently from the reaction that Astro had to grab him to\r\nkeep him from falling down.\r\n\r\n\"Where are Corbett and Manning?\" demanded Connel.\r\n\r\n\"Lactu ... he took them both in there ... through a secret passageway.\"\r\nSharkey pointed to the closet with a trembling finger.\r\n\r\nStrong jumped for the closet door and jerked it open. He saw the open\r\nwall and the stairs leading down. \"Come on! This way!\"\r\n\r\nConnel ran wildly into the closet, followed by Astro. Suddenly the big\r\ncadet stopped, turned, and fired point-blank at the figurehead of the\r\nNationalist rebellion. Sharkey once again grew rigid.\r\n\r\nThe two Solar Guard officers raced down the stairs into the tunnel and\r\nran headlong through the darkness. Time was precious now. The lives of\r\nTom and Roger might be lost by a wasted second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What's that noise, Tom?\"\r\n\r\nThe two cadets were walking through the tunnel when they heard the\r\nstrange booming roar. Behind them, Sinclair overheard Roger's whispered\r\nquestion and laughed. \"That is the sound of the slaves being fed their\r\nlunch. They do not know yet that there has been a battle and soon\r\nthey'll be free!\"\r\n\r\n\"Slaves!\" gasped Roger. \"What kind of slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see. Keep going!\" Sinclair prodded the cadets with his ray\r\ngun. The tunnel had grown larger and the downward slant of the floor\r\nlessened as they pressed forward. The noise ahead of them grew louder\r\nand stronger and now they could distinguish occasional words above the\r\ndin.\r\n\r\n\"We must pass through the big vault where the slaves are working,\" said\r\nSinclair. \"I would advise you to keep your mouths shut and do as I say!\"\r\n\r\nNeither Tom nor Roger answered, keeping their eyes straight ahead.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel suddenly cut sharply to the right and they could see a blaze\r\nof light in front of them. The two boys stopped involuntarily, and then\r\nwere nudged forward by Sinclair's guns. Before them was a huge cavern\r\nnearly a thousand yards high and three thousand yards across,\r\nilluminated by hundreds of torches. Along one side of the cave a line of\r\nmen were waiting to have battered tin plates filled from a huge pot at\r\nthe head of the line. The men were in rags, and every one of them was\r\nhardly more than skin and bones. At strategic places around the cavern,\r\nNationalist guards kept their guns trained and ready to fire. They\r\nbrought up their guns quickly as Tom and Roger entered, and then lowered\r\nthem again as Sinclair appeared. Every eye turned to the Nationalist\r\nleader as he marched across the floor of the cave, Tom and Roger walking\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Sinclair, \"these wretched fools thought my organization\r\nwas a utopia until they learned that I was no better for them than the\r\nSolar Guard. Unfortunately they learned too late and were sent here to\r\ndig underground pits for my spaceships and storage dumps.\"\r\n\r\nThe small column of three marched across the floor of the cave toward\r\nanother small tunnel on the opposite side. The slaves were absolutely\r\nstill, and the guards smiled a greeting at their leader when he passed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSinclair ignored them all. \"Beyond that tunnel,\" he continued, pointing\r\nto the small opening ahead of them, \"there is a spaceship. We will board\r\nthat ship and blast off. The three of us. Where we will go, I haven't\r\ndecided yet. Perhaps a long trip into deep space until the Solar Guard\r\nhas forgotten about you and me and the Nationalists. Then we will\r\nreturn, as I said before, to Mars, or perhaps Ganymede, and I will start\r\nall over again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're mad!\" said Tom through clenched teeth. \"Crazy as a space bug!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see, Corbett. We shall see!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Roger broke away and raced toward the mass of slaves. He\r\nshouted wildly, \"Get the guards! The Nationalists are beaten! The base\r\nin the canyon has been destroyed! Hurry! Rebel!\"\r\n\r\nThe emaciated men milled around the cadet, all asking questions at once.\r\n\r\nSinclair signaled to the guards. \"Shoot him down!\" Four guards took\r\ncareful aim.\r\n\r\n\"Roger! Look out!\" warned Tom.\r\n\r\nRoger whirled around in time to see the guards about to fire. He dived\r\nfor a mound of dirt and hid behind it. The energy shock waves licked at\r\nthe sand where he had stood a second before. Roger got up and ran for\r\nbetter cover, the guards continuing to fire at him. Then, around the\r\ncadet, the slave workers began to come alive. Some hurled stones at the\r\nguards, others began climbing up the sides to the ledges where the\r\nguards stood. Taking in the situation at a glance, Sinclair shoved the\r\nray gun in Tom's back and snarled, \"Get going!\"\r\n\r\nThe young cadet had no alternative. He turned and marched hurriedly\r\nacross the floor toward the small tunnel ahead of him. Several slave\r\nworkers tried to attack Sinclair, but in their weakened condition, they\r\nwere no match for the alert Nationalist leader who froze them instantly\r\nwith his paralo-ray gun.\r\n\r\nRoger saw Tom heading for the tunnel and made a sudden dash for\r\nSinclair. But the rebel leader heard the pounding of footsteps and\r\nturned to fire at Roger as the cadet sailed through the air in a flying\r\ntackle. The jolting ray hit him squarely and he landed on the ground\r\nwith a thud a few feet from Sinclair, completely immobilized again.\r\n\r\nTom tried to seize the momentary advantage, but once again Sinclair was\r\nquicker and forced Tom back into the small opening of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nAround them, the slave workers were being whipped into a frenzy after\r\nmonths of stored-up hatred for their guards. Hundreds of them were\r\nclimbing up toward the guards' posts, unmindful of the deadly fire\r\npouring down on them.\r\n\r\n\"Get in there quick!\" demanded Sinclair. He shoved Tom through the small\r\nopening, and after a quick glance over his shoulder at the surging\r\nslaves, followed the cadet.\r\n\r\nSinclair flashed a light ahead of them and Tom saw the reflection of a\r\nbright surface. In the distance he recognized the outlines of a\r\nspaceship.\r\n\r\n\"Keep moving!\" ordered Sinclair. \"You're my protection in getting out of\r\nhere, and if I have to freeze you and carry you aboard, that's just what\r\nI'll do! Now get moving!\"\r\n\r\nTom walked to the air lock of the ship, Sinclair right in back of him.\r\nThe rebel leader pressed an outside button in the ship's stabilizer fin\r\nand the port swung open slowly. \"Get in!\" growled Sinclair.\r\n\r\nTom stepped into the ship and waited. Sinclair climbed in in back of him\r\nand closed the air lock.\r\n\r\n\"Through that hatch,\" said Sinclair, motioning toward the iron ladder,\r\n\"and keep your hands in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you think you're going to get through the Solar Guard fleet\r\nthat's standing off above the canyon?\" asked Tom casually. \"As soon as\r\nthey see this ship blast off, you'll have a hundred atomic war heads\r\nblasting after you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as long as I have you!\" sneered Sinclair. \"You're my protection!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wrong,\" said Tom. \"They'll open fire, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the chance I've got to take,\" said Sinclair. \"Now climb up to\r\nthe control deck and get on the audioceiver. You're going to tell them\r\nyou're aboard!\"\r\n\r\nTom walked ahead of the rebel leader toward the control deck, his mind\r\nracing. He knew that Sinclair was going through with his plan and he\r\nalso knew that the Solar Guard would not pay any attention to anything\r\nhe had to say. If, after three warnings, Sinclair didn't brake jets and\r\nbring his ship to a stop, he would be blasted out of space. He had to do\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the communicator?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Over by the radar scanner.\" Sinclair eyed him suspiciously. \"Remember,\r\nCorbett, your life depends on this as much as mine. If you don't\r\nconvince them you're worth saving by letting me get away, you're a dead\r\npigeon!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't have to tell me,\" said Tom. \"I know when I'm licked.\"\r\n\r\nSinclair took his position in the pilot's chair, facing the control\r\npanel. For a brief moment his back was to Tom as he bent over to turn on\r\nthe generators. Tom took a deep breath and lurched across the deck. But\r\nSinclair turned and saw him coming, and jerked up the ray gun. He wasn't\r\nable to get clear in time. Tom's fingers circled the barrel of the gun\r\nas Sinclair fired. The barrel grew hot as Sinclair fired repeatedly.\r\nTom's fingers were beginning to blister under the intense heat, but he\r\nheld on. With his other hand he reached up for the rebel's throat.\r\nSinclair grabbed his wrist and, locked together, they rolled around on\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sinclair wasn't able to get clear in time_]\r\n\r\nSinclair continued to fire the ray gun and Tom's fingers were burning\r\nwith pain from the heat. Suddenly the cadet let go the gun, spun around,\r\nand jerked Sinclair off balance. He swung his free hand as hard as he\r\ncould into the rebel's stomach. Sinclair doubled over and staggered\r\nback, dropping the gun. Tom was on top of him like a shot, pounding\r\nstraight, jolting rights and lefts to the man's head and stomach. But\r\nSinclair was tough. He twisted around, and quick as a cat, jumped to his\r\nfeet. Then, stepping in, he rapped a solid right to Tom's jaw. The cadet\r\nreeled back, nearly falling to the deck. Sinclair was in on top of him\r\nin a flash, pounding his head and body with vicious smashing blows.\r\n\r\nTom fell to the floor under the savagery of the rebel leader's attack.\r\nSinclair lifted his foot to kick the cadet as Tom's fingers tightened\r\naround the barrel of the discarded ray gun. He brought it up sharply\r\nagainst the planter's shin and he staggered back in pain. Tom took\r\ncareful aim. He fired the gun. Nothing happened. The gun was empty.\r\n\r\nSinclair rushed the cadet again, but Tom stepped aside and swung the\r\nheavy gun with all his might. The metal smashed against Sinclair's head\r\nand he sank to the deck, out cold.\r\n\r\nThe last rebel of Venus had been defeated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We found Roger trying to keep the slaves away from the guards,\" said\r\nStrong. \"They were ready to tear them apart!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say that I blame them,\" snorted Connel. \"Some of those poor\r\ndevils had been working in the caves for three years!\"\r\n\r\nTom, Roger, and Astro sat sprawled in chairs in one of the offices of\r\nthe Nationalist headquarters listening to Strong and Major Connel sum up\r\nthe day's battle. The entire army of Nationalist guards, Division\r\nChiefs, and workers had been rounded up and put aboard the troop\r\ncarriers to be taken to a prison asteroid. Each individual rebel would\r\nbe dealt with under special court proceedings to be established by Solar\r\nAlliance decree later.\r\n\r\n\"There are still some things I don't understand,\" said Astro. \"How did\r\nthey know you were going to investigate them in the first place?\"\r\n\r\n\"After our meeting with Commander Walters,\" said Connel, \"we sent a\r\nspecial coded message to the Solar Alliance Delegate here on Venus. His\r\nsecretary intercepted the message, used stolen priorities for himself\r\nand two assistants to get to Earth and back on an express space liner\r\nwithout being missed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The secretary!\" shouted Tom. \"That's the same fellow I saw in Atom City\r\nwhen we were bumped out of our seats on the _Venus Lark_!\"\r\n\r\nRoger looked up at Tom with a scowl. \"A fine time to remember!\"\r\n\r\nStrong grinned. \"We discovered him, Tom, when that attempt was made to\r\nkidnap you by the cab driver. We also picked up the owner of the\r\npawnshop.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most amazing thing about this space joker, Sinclair,\" commented\r\nConnel, \"was the way he had everyone fooled. I couldn't figure out how\r\nhe was able to get around so quickly until I learned about those\r\nbuildings.\"\r\n\r\n\"What buildings?\" asked Tom, suddenly remembering how the rebel leader\r\nhad disappeared so quickly and quietly when he was being held captive\r\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Hill in the Sinclair home.\r\n\r\n\"Every one of the important members of the organization, the Division\r\nChiefs, they called themselves, had a small shack on his property near\r\nthe edge of the jungle. It was nothing more than a covering for a shaft\r\nthat led to a tunnel, which, in turn, led to other tunnels under the\r\njungle and eventually connected with one leading right into the base.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" said Astro, \"they have underground tunnels all through the\r\njungle?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" asserted Connel. \"If they had been prepared for our\r\nattack, they could have beaten the pants off us. Not only in space, but\r\non the ground. They could have run circles around us in those tunnels. I\r\ngot suspicious when I found a hut at the Sharkey place with no windows\r\nin it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, remember the time Sinclair barked at me for going near that shack\r\non his place when we first arrived?\" said Roger.\r\n\r\nConnel grinned. \"I'll bet you a plugged credit that if you had opened\r\nthat door you'd have been frozen stiffer than a snowman on Pluto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyhow,\" said Tom happily, \"we got what we came after.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" asked Strong.\r\n\r\n\"A tyrannosaurus!\" replied the curly-haired cadet.\r\n\r\n\"And that's another thing,\" said Connel. \"That tyrannosaurus we killed\r\nwas a pet of the Nationalists. I don't mean a household pet, but it\r\nfitted into their plans nicely. The tyranno's lair was near the top of\r\nthat canyon. Any time a stray hunter came along, the tyrannosaurus would\r\nscare him away. So when you three came along and said you were\r\ndeliberately hunting for a tyrannosaurus, they got worried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worried?\" asked Roger. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"They thought you were actually hunting or investigating them, and when\r\nI started nosing around, they were sure. That's why Sinclair ordered his\r\nboys to burn down his plantation--to try to throw us off the track. So\r\nyou see,\" Connel concluded, \"your summer leave really started the ball\r\nrolling against them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Summer leave!\" shouted Roger. \"What day is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The twenty-ninth of August,\" replied Strong.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" moaned the blond-haired cadet. \"We start back to class in\r\nthree days!\"\r\n\r\n\"Three days!\" roared Astro. \"But--but it'll take three days to write up\r\nour reports of everything that's happened! We won't have any time for\r\nfun!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fun!\" snorted Connel. \"Fun is for little boys. You three space-brained,\r\nrocket-headed idiots are spacemen!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    |                      Transcriber's Note                      |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    | One instance of \"nearby\" was changed to \"near-by\" to conform |\r\n    |        with the hyphenation in the rest of the text.         |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    |             The following typos were corrected:              |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    |                    Get         \"Get                          |\r\n    |                    it          It                            |\r\n    |                    get's       gets                          |\r\n    |                    surpressed  suppressed                    |\r\n    |                    order       ordered                       |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------------------+",
