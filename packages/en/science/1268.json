The sea is below the\r\ncar! It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!” “Overboard with every\r\nweight! ... everything!”\r\n\r\nSuch were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air,\r\nabove the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four o’clock in the\r\nevening of the 23rd of March, 1865.\r\n\r\nFew can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast,\r\nin the middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest raged without\r\nintermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were\r\nterrible in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a distance of eighteen\r\nhundred miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the\r\nthirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel. Towns were\r\noverthrown, forests uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of\r\nwater which were precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which\r\nthe published accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled\r\nby waterspouts which destroyed everything they passed over, several\r\nthousand people crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces\r\nof its fury, left by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters\r\nthose which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the 25th\r\nof October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.\r\n\r\nBut while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a\r\ndrama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a\r\nwaterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of\r\nair and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning\r\nround and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.\r\n\r\nBeneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five\r\npassengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled\r\nwith spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWhence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From\r\nwhat part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started\r\nduring the storm. But the storm had raged five days already, and the\r\nfirst symptoms were manifested on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that\r\nthe balloon came from a great distance, for it could not have traveled\r\nless than two thousand miles in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAt any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance,\r\ncould not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed\r\nsince their departure. It was a remarkable fact that, although in the\r\nvery midst of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it. They\r\nwere thrown about and whirled round and round without feeling the\r\nrotation in the slightest degree, or being sensible that they were\r\nremoved from a horizontal position.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered\r\nbeneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density\r\nof the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or\r\nnight. No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring\r\nof the ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while\r\nsuspended in those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone had\r\ninformed them of the dangers which they ran from the waves. However,\r\nthe balloon, lightened of heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and\r\nprovisions, had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a\r\nheight of 4,500 feet. The voyagers, after having discovered that the sea\r\nextended beneath them, and thinking the dangers above less dreadful than\r\nthose below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful\r\narticles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life\r\nof their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss.\r\n\r\nThe night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to\r\nless energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest\r\nbegan to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March,\r\nit showed symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had\r\nrisen into the more lofty regions of the air. In a few hours the wind\r\nhad changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate\r\nof the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half. It\r\nwas still what sailors call “a close-reefed topsail breeze,” but the\r\ncommotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished.\r\n\r\nTowards eleven o’clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly\r\nclearer. The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt\r\nafter the passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone\r\nfarther to the west. It appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have\r\npassed away in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to\r\nthe typhoons of the Indian Ocean?\r\n\r\nBut at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again\r\nslowly descending with a regular movement. It appeared as if it were,\r\nlittle by little, collapsing, and that its case was lengthening and\r\nextending, passing from a spherical to an oval form. Towards midday the\r\nballoon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet. It\r\ncontained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity, it\r\ncould maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a\r\ngreat altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position.\r\n\r\nPerceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles\r\nwhich still weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept,\r\neverything, even to their pocket-knives, and one of them, having hoisted\r\nhimself on to the circles which united the cords of the net, tried to\r\nsecure more firmly the lower point of the balloon.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and\r\nthat the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions.\r\nThey must infallibly perish!\r\n\r\nThere was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them.\r\nThe watery expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid\r\nsurface upon which their anchor could hold.\r\n\r\nIt was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous\r\nviolence! It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those\r\nwhose gaze, from their commanding position, extended over a radius of\r\nforty miles. The vast liquid plain, lashed without mercy by the storm,\r\nappeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers, whose white and\r\ndisheveled crests were streaming in the wind. No land was in sight, not\r\na solitary ship could be seen. It was necessary at any cost to arrest\r\ntheir downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in\r\nthe waves. The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work.\r\nBut, notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the\r\nsame time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the direction of\r\nthe wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the southwest.\r\n\r\nFrightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men. They were\r\nevidently no longer masters of the machine. All their attempts were\r\nuseless. The case of the balloon collapsed more and more. The gas\r\nescaped without any possibility of retaining it. Their descent was\r\nvisibly accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within 600 feet\r\nof the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a\r\nlarge rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the articles which\r\nit contained, the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension\r\nin the air for a few hours. But the inevitable catastrophe could only\r\nbe retarded, and if land did not appear before night, voyagers, car, and\r\nballoon must to a certainty vanish beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nThey now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were truly\r\ndauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a single\r\nmurmur escaped from their lips. They were determined to struggle to the\r\nlast minute, to do anything to retard their fall. The car was only a\r\nsort of willow basket, unable to float, and there was not the slightest\r\npossibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nTwo more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was\r\ninaccessible to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not\r\nless determined. “Is everything thrown out?” “No, here are still 2,000\r\ndollars in gold.” A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea. “Does\r\nthe balloon rise?” “A little, but it will not be long before it falls\r\nagain.” “What still remains to be thrown out?” “Nothing.” “Yes! the\r\ncar!” “Let us catch hold of the net, and into the sea with the car.”\r\n\r\nThis was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon.\r\nThe ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall,\r\nmounted 2,000 feet. The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the\r\nnet, and clung to the meshes, gazing at the abyss.\r\n\r\nThe delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is sufficient to\r\nthrow out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical\r\nposition. The apparatus in the air is like a balance of mathematical\r\nprecision. It can be thus easily understood that when it is lightened of\r\nany considerable weight its movement will be impetuous and sudden. So\r\nit happened on this occasion. But after being suspended for an instant\r\naloft, the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent\r\nwhich it was impossible to repair.\r\n\r\nThe men had done all that men could do. No human efforts could save them\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThey must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA loud barking was heard. A dog accompanied the voyagers, and was held\r\npressed close to his master in the meshes of the net.\r\n\r\n“Top has seen something,” cried one of the men. Then immediately a loud\r\nvoice shouted,--\r\n\r\n“Land! land!” The balloon, which the wind still drove towards the\r\nsouthwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance, which might\r\nbe reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in\r\nfact, appeared in that direction. But this land was still thirty miles\r\noff. It would not take less than an hour to get to it, and then there\r\nwas the chance of falling to leeward.\r\n\r\nAn hour! Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid\r\nit yet retained?\r\n\r\nSuch was the terrible question! The voyagers could distinctly see that\r\nsolid spot which they must reach at any cost. They were ignorant of what\r\nit was, whether an island or a continent, for they did not know to what\r\npart of the world the hurricane had driven them. But they must reach\r\nthis land, whether inhabited or desolate, whether hospitable or not.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself! Several\r\ntimes already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom\r\nof the net, making it still heavier, and the balloon only half rose,\r\nlike a bird with a wounded wing. Half an hour later the land was not\r\nmore than a mile off, but the balloon, exhausted, flabby, hanging in\r\ngreat folds, had gas in its upper part alone. The voyagers, clinging to\r\nthe net, were still too heavy for it, and soon, half plunged into the\r\nsea, they were beaten by the furious waves. The balloon-case bulged out\r\nagain, and the wind, taking it, drove it along like a vessel. Might it\r\nnot possibly thus reach the land?\r\n\r\nBut, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from four pairs\r\nof lungs at once. The balloon, which had appeared as if it would never\r\nagain rise, suddenly made an unexpected bound, after having been struck\r\nby a tremendous sea. As if it had been at that instant relieved of a new\r\npart of its weight, it mounted to a height of 1,500 feet, and here it\r\nmet a current of wind, which instead of taking it directly to the coast,\r\ncarried it in a nearly parallel direction.\r\n\r\nAt last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally fell on\r\na sandy beach, out of the reach of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves from\r\nthe meshes of the net. The balloon, relieved of their weight, was taken\r\nby the wind, and like a wounded bird which revives for an instant,\r\ndisappeared into space.\r\n\r\nBut the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the balloon\r\nonly left four on the shore.\r\n\r\nThe missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea, which had\r\njust struck the net, and it was owing to this circumstance that the\r\nlightened balloon rose the last time, and then soon after reached the\r\nland. Scarcely had the four castaways set foot on firm ground, than they\r\nall, thinking of the absent one, simultaneously exclaimed, “Perhaps he\r\nwill try to swim to land! Let us save him! let us save him!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nThose whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were neither\r\naeronauts by profession nor amateurs. They were prisoners of war whose\r\nboldness had induced them to escape in this extraordinary manner.\r\n\r\nA hundred times they had almost perished! A hundred times had they\r\nalmost fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean. But\r\nHeaven had reserved them for a strange destiny, and after having, on the\r\n20th of March, escaped from Richmond, besieged by the troops of General\r\nUlysses Grant, they found themselves seven thousand miles from the\r\ncapital of Virginia, which was the principal stronghold of the South,\r\nduring the terrible War of Secession. Their aerial voyage had lasted\r\nfive days.\r\n\r\nThe curious circumstances which led to the escape of the prisoners were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThat same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the coups\r\nde main by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to possess\r\nhimself of Richmond, several of his officers fell into the power of the\r\nenemy and were detained in the town. One of the most distinguished was\r\nCaptain Cyrus Harding. He was a native of Massachusetts, a first-class\r\nengineer, to whom the government had confided, during the war, the\r\ndirection of the railways, which were so important at that time. A\r\ntrue Northerner, thin, bony, lean, about forty-five years of age; his\r\nclose-cut hair and his beard, of which he only kept a thick mustache,\r\nwere already getting gray. He had one-of those finely-developed heads\r\nwhich appear made to be struck on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious\r\nmouth, the physiognomy of a clever man of the military school. He was\r\none of those engineers who began by handling the hammer and pickaxe,\r\nlike generals who first act as common soldiers. Besides mental power, he\r\nalso possessed great manual dexterity. His muscles exhibited remarkable\r\nproofs of tenacity. A man of action as well as a man of thought, all he\r\ndid was without effort to one of his vigorous and sanguine temperament.\r\nLearned, clear-headed, and practical, he fulfilled in all\r\nemergencies those three conditions which united ought to insure human\r\nsuccess--activity of mind and body, impetuous wishes, and powerful will.\r\nHe might have taken for his motto that of William of Orange in the 17th\r\ncentury: “I can undertake and persevere even without hope of success.”\r\n Cyrus Harding was courage personified. He had been in all the battles of\r\nthat war. After having begun as a volunteer at Illinois, under Ulysses\r\nGrant, he fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg Landing, at the siege of\r\nCorinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga, the Wilderness, on the\r\nPotomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy of the general who\r\nsaid, “I never count my dead!” And hundreds of times Captain Harding had\r\nalmost been among those who were not counted by the terrible Grant; but\r\nin these combats where he never spared himself, fortune favored him till\r\nthe moment when he was wounded and taken prisoner on the field of battle\r\nnear Richmond. At the same time and on the same day another important\r\npersonage fell into the hands of the Southerners. This was no other than\r\nGideon Spilett, a reporter for the New York Herald, who had been ordered\r\nto follow the changes of the war in the midst of the Northern armies.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American\r\nchroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain\r\nexact information, and transmit it to their journal in the shortest\r\npossible time. The newspapers of the Union, such as the New York Herald,\r\nare genuine powers, and their reporters are men to be reckoned with.\r\nGideon Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters: a man of great\r\nmerit, energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas, having\r\ntraveled over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in\r\ncouncil, resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor\r\ndanger, when in pursuit of information, for himself first, and then for\r\nhis journal, a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious\r\nsubjects, of the unpublished, of the unknown, and of the impossible. He\r\nwas one of those intrepid observers who write under fire, “reporting”\r\n among bullets, and to whom every danger is welcome.\r\n\r\nHe also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver in one\r\nhand, note-book in the other; grape-shot never made his pencil tremble.\r\nHe did not fatigue the wires with incessant telegrams, like those who\r\nspeak when they have nothing to say, but each of his notes, short,\r\ndecisive, and clear, threw light on some important point. Besides, he\r\nwas not wanting in humor. It was he who, after the affair of the Black\r\nRiver, determined at any cost to keep his place at the wicket of the\r\ntelegraph office, and after having announced to his journal the result\r\nof the battle, telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the\r\nBible. It cost the New York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New\r\nYork Herald published the first intelligence.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett was tall. He was rather more than forty years of age.\r\nLight whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye was steady,\r\nlively, rapid in its changes. It was the eye of a man accustomed to take\r\nin at a glance all the details of a scene. Well built, he was inured to\r\nall climates, like a bar of steel hardened in cold water.\r\n\r\nFor ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New York\r\nHerald, which he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he was as\r\nskilful in the use of the pencil as of the pen. When he was captured,\r\nhe was in the act of making a description and sketch of the battle. The\r\nlast words in his note-book were these: “A Southern rifleman has just\r\ntaken aim at me, but--” The Southerner notwithstanding missed Gideon\r\nSpilett, who, with his usual fortune, came out of this affair without a\r\nscratch.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other except\r\nby reputation, had both been carried to Richmond. The engineer’s\r\nwounds rapidly healed, and it was during his convalescence that he made\r\nacquaintance with the reporter. The two men then learned to appreciate\r\neach other. Soon their common aim had but one object, that of escaping,\r\nrejoining Grant’s army, and fighting together in the ranks of the\r\nFederals.\r\n\r\nThe two Americans had from the first determined to seize every chance;\r\nbut although they were allowed to wander at liberty in the town,\r\nRichmond was so strictly guarded, that escape appeared impossible. In\r\nthe meanwhile Captain Harding was rejoined by a servant who was devoted\r\nto him in life and in death. This intrepid fellow was a Negro born on\r\nthe engineer’s estate, of a slave father and mother, but to whom Cyrus,\r\nwho was an Abolitionist from conviction and heart, had long since given\r\nhis freedom. The once slave, though free, would not leave his master. He\r\nwould have died for him. He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active,\r\nclever, intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry,\r\nobliging, and honest. His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only answered\r\nto the familiar abbreviation of Neb.\r\n\r\nWhen Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left\r\nMassachusetts without hesitating an instant, arrived before Richmond,\r\nand by dint of stratagem and shrewdness, after having risked his life\r\ntwenty times over, managed to penetrate into the besieged town. The\r\npleasure of Harding on seeing his servant, and the joy of Neb at finding\r\nhis master, can scarcely be described.\r\n\r\nBut though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it was quite\r\nanother thing to get out again, for the Northern prisoners were very\r\nstrictly watched. Some extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the\r\nattempt with any chance of success, and this opportunity not only did\r\nnot present itself, but was very difficult to find.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations. The victory of\r\nPetersburg had been very dearly bought. His forces, united to those of\r\nButler, had as yet been unsuccessful before Richmond, and nothing gave\r\nthe prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance.\r\n\r\nThe reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single\r\nincident worthy of note, could stand it no longer. His usually active\r\nmind was occupied with one sole thought--how he might get out of\r\nRichmond at any cost. Several times had he even made the attempt,\r\nbut was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle. However, the siege\r\ncontinued; and if the prisoners were anxious to escape and join Grant’s\r\narmy, certain of the besieged were no less anxious to join the Southern\r\nforces. Among them was one Jonathan Forster, a determined Southerner.\r\nThe truth was, that if the prisoners of the Secessionists could not\r\nleave the town, neither could the Secessionists themselves while the\r\nNorthern army invested it. The Governor of Richmond for a long time had\r\nbeen unable to communicate with General Lee, and he very much wished to\r\nmake known to him the situation of the town, so as to hasten the march\r\nof the army to their relief. Thus Jonathan Forster accordingly conceived\r\nthe idea of rising in a balloon, so as to pass over the besieging lines,\r\nand in that way reach the Secessionist camp.\r\n\r\nThe Governor authorized the attempt. A balloon was manufactured and\r\nplaced at the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by five\r\nother persons. They were furnished with arms in case they might have\r\nto defend themselves when they alighted, and provisions in the event of\r\ntheir aerial voyage being prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March. It should\r\nbe effected during the night, with a northwest wind of moderate force,\r\nand the aeronauts calculated that they would reach General Lee’s camp in\r\na few hours.\r\n\r\nBut this northwest wind was not a simple breeze. From the 18th it was\r\nevident that it was changing to a hurricane. The tempest soon became\r\nsuch that Forster’s departure was deferred, for it was impossible to\r\nrisk the balloon and those whom it carried in the midst of the furious\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nThe balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready to\r\ndepart on the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be supposed, the\r\nimpatience among the besieged to see the storm moderate was very great.\r\n\r\nThe 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the\r\nweather. There was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon fastened\r\nto the ground, as the squalls dashed it furiously about.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm blew with\r\nredoubled force. The departure of the balloon was impossible.\r\n\r\nOn that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of the\r\nstreets of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least know. This\r\nwas a sailor named Pencroft, a man of about thirty-five or forty years\r\nof age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of\r\nbright sparkling eyes and a remarkably good physiognomy. Pencroft was an\r\nAmerican from the North, who had sailed all the ocean over, and who had\r\ngone through every possible and almost impossible adventure that a being\r\nwith two feet and no wings would encounter. It is needless to say that\r\nhe was a bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished\r\nat nothing. Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond\r\non business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a\r\nformer captain, an orphan, whom he loved as if he had been his\r\nown child. Not having been able to leave the town before the first\r\noperations of the siege, he found himself shut up, to his great disgust;\r\nbut, not accustomed to succumb to difficulties, he resolved to escape by\r\nsome means or other. He knew the engineer-officer by reputation; he knew\r\nwith what impatience that determined man chafed under his restraint. On\r\nthis day he did not, therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without\r\ncircumlocution, “Have you had enough of Richmond, captain?”\r\n\r\nThe engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added, in a\r\nlow voice,--\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding, will you try to escape?”\r\n\r\n“When?” asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this\r\nquestion was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet examined\r\nthe stranger who addressed him. But after having with a penetrating\r\neye observed the open face of the sailor, he was convinced that he had\r\nbefore him an honest man.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked briefly.\r\n\r\nPencroft made himself known.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Harding, “and in what way do you propose to escape?”\r\n\r\n“By that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and which looks\r\nto me as if it was waiting on purpose for us--”\r\n\r\nThere was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence. The\r\nengineer understood him at once. He seized Pencroft by the arm, and\r\ndragged him to his house. There the sailor developed his project, which\r\nwas indeed extremely simple. They risked nothing but their lives in its\r\nexecution. The hurricane was in all its violence, it is true, but so\r\nclever and daring an engineer as Cyrus Harding knew perfectly well how\r\nto manage a balloon. Had he himself been as well acquainted with the art\r\nof sailing in the air as he was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft\r\nwould not have hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend\r\nHerbert with him; for, accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the\r\nocean, he was not to be hindered on account of the hurricane.\r\n\r\nCaptain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a word,\r\nbut his eyes shone with satisfaction. Here was the long-sought-for\r\nopportunity--he was not a man to let it pass. The plan was feasible,\r\nthough, it must be confessed, dangerous in the extreme. In the night,\r\nin spite of their guards, they might approach the balloon, slip into the\r\ncar, and then cut the cords which held it. There was no doubt that they\r\nmight be killed, but on the other hand they might succeed, and without\r\nthis storm!--Without this storm the balloon would have started already\r\nand the looked-for opportunity would not have then presented itself.\r\n\r\n“I am not alone!” said Harding at last.\r\n\r\n“How many people do you wish to bring with you?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Two; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb.”\r\n\r\n“That will be three,” replied Pencroft; “and with Herbert and me five.\r\nBut the balloon will hold six--”\r\n\r\n“That will be enough, we will go,” answered Harding in a firm voice.\r\n\r\nThis “we” included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well knew,\r\nwas not a man to draw back, and when the project was communicated to him\r\nhe approved of it unreservedly. What astonished him was, that so simple\r\nan idea had not occurred to him before. As to Neb, he followed his\r\nmaster wherever his master wished to go.\r\n\r\n“This evening, then,” said Pencroft, “we will all meet out there.”\r\n\r\n“This evening, at ten o’clock,” replied Captain Harding; “and Heaven\r\ngrant that the storm does not abate before our departure.”\r\n\r\nPencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his lodging,\r\nwhere young Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy knew of the\r\nsailor’s plan, and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result\r\nof the proposal being made to the engineer. Thus five determined\r\npersons were about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous\r\nelements!\r\n\r\nNo! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor his\r\ncompanions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.\r\n\r\nIt would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one thing; it\r\nwas that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about by the\r\nwind, would be torn into shreds. For several hours he roamed round the\r\nnearly-deserted square, surveying the apparatus. Pencroft did the same\r\non his side, his hands in his pockets, yawning now and then like a man\r\nwho did not know how to kill the time, but really dreading, like\r\nhis friend, either the escape or destruction of the balloon. Evening\r\narrived. The night was dark in the extreme. Thick mists passed like\r\nclouds close to the ground. Rain fell mingled with snow, it was very\r\ncold. A mist hung over Richmond. It seemed as if the violent storm had\r\nproduced a truce between the besiegers and the besieged, and that the\r\ncannon were silenced by the louder detonations of the storm. The streets\r\nof the town were deserted. It had not even appeared necessary in that\r\nhorrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of which\r\nplunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of the prisoners,\r\nbut what might possibly be the termination of the hazardous voyage they\r\ncontemplated in the midst of the furious elements?--\r\n\r\n“Dirty weather!” exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on his head\r\nwith a blow of his fist; “but pshaw, we shall succeed all the same!”\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine, Harding and his companions glided from different\r\ndirections into the square, which the gas-lamps, extinguished by the\r\nwind, had left in total obscurity. Even the enormous balloon, almost\r\nbeaten to the ground, could not be seen. Independently of the sacks of\r\nballast, to which the cords of the net were fastened, the car was\r\nheld by a strong cable passed through a ring in the pavement. The five\r\nprisoners met by the car. They had not been perceived, and such was the\r\ndarkness that they could not even see each other.\r\n\r\nWithout speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their\r\nplaces in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer’s order detached\r\nsuccessively the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few minutes only,\r\nand the sailor rejoined his companions.\r\n\r\nThe balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer had\r\nnothing to do but to give the word.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was Top,\r\na favorite of the engineer. The faithful creature, having broken his\r\nchain, had followed his master. He, however, fearing that its additional\r\nweight might impede their ascent, wished to send away the animal.\r\n\r\n“One more will make but little difference, poor beast!” exclaimed\r\nPencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke letting go the\r\ncable; the balloon ascending in an oblique direction, disappeared, after\r\nhaving dashed the car against two chimneys, which it threw down as it\r\nswept by them.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to the\r\nvoyagers. During the night the engineer could not dream of descending,\r\nand when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below was intercepted by\r\nfog.\r\n\r\nFive days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see the\r\nwide extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the maddest\r\nfury by the gale.\r\n\r\nOur readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals\r\nwho set out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of\r\nMarch. Five days afterwards four of them were thrown on a desert coast,\r\nseven thousand miles from their country! But one of their number was\r\nmissing, the man who was to be their guide, their leading spirit, the\r\nengineer, Captain Harding! The instant they had recovered their feet,\r\nthey all hurried to the beach in the hopes of rendering him assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nThe engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been carried\r\noff by a wave. His dog also had disappeared. The faithful animal\r\nhad voluntarily leaped out to help his master. “Forward,” cried the\r\nreporter; and all four, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb, forgetting\r\ntheir fatigue, began their search. Poor Neb shed bitter tears, giving\r\nway to despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nOnly two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding disappeared\r\nto the moment when his companions set foot on the ground. They had hopes\r\ntherefore of arriving in time to save him. “Let us look for him! let us\r\nlook for him!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Neb,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and we will find him too!”\r\n\r\n“Living, I trust!”\r\n\r\n“Still living!”\r\n\r\n“Can he swim?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Neb, “and besides, Top is there.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his head.\r\n\r\nThe engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and nearly half\r\na mile from the place where the castaways had landed. The nearest point\r\nof the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off.\r\n\r\nIt was then nearly six o’clock. A thick fog made the night very dark.\r\nThe castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had\r\nthrown them, an unknown region, the geographical situation of which they\r\ncould not even guess. They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with\r\nstones, which appeared destitute of any sort of vegetation. The ground,\r\nvery unequal and rough, was in some places perfectly riddled with holes,\r\nmaking walking extremely painful. From these holes escaped every minute\r\ngreat birds of clumsy flight, which flew in all directions. Others, more\r\nactive, rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads. The sailor\r\nthought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose\r\nabove the roaring of the sea.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for\r\nsome response from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had\r\nlanded, and they had been near to the place, they would have heard the\r\nbarking of the dog Top, even should Harding himself have been unable to\r\ngive any sign of existence. They stopped to listen, but no sound arose\r\nabove the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf. The little\r\nband then continued their march forward, searching into every hollow of\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nAfter walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were suddenly\r\nbrought to a standstill by the sight of foaming billows close to\r\ntheir feet. The solid ground ended here. They found themselves at the\r\nextremity of a sharp point on which the sea broke furiously.\r\n\r\n“It is a promontory,” said the sailor; “we must retrace our steps,\r\nholding towards the right, and we shall thus gain the mainland.”\r\n\r\n“But if he is there,” said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose waves shone\r\nof a snowy white in the darkness. “Well, let us call again,” and all\r\nuniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout, but there came no\r\nreply. They waited for a lull, then began again; still no reply.\r\n\r\nThe castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side of the\r\npromontory, over a soil equally sandy and rugged. However, Pencroft\r\nobserved that the shore was more equal, that the ground rose, and he\r\ndeclared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill, whose massive\r\nfront he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the\r\nmist. The birds were less numerous on this part of the shore; the sea\r\nwas also less tumultuous, and they observed that the agitation of the\r\nwaves was diminished. The noise of the surf was scarcely heard. This\r\nside of the promontory evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the\r\nsharp point sheltered from the breakers of the open sea. But to follow\r\nthis direction was to go south, exactly opposite to that part of the\r\ncoast where Harding might have landed. After a walk of a mile and a\r\nhalf, the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to\r\nthe north. This promontory, of which they had turned the point, must\r\nbe attached to the mainland. The castaways, although their strength\r\nwas nearly exhausted, still marched courageously forward, hoping every\r\nmoment to meet with a sudden angle which would set them in the first\r\ndirection. What was their disappointment, when, after trudging nearly\r\ntwo miles, having reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks,\r\nthey found themselves again stopped by the sea.\r\n\r\n“We are on an islet,” said Pencroft, “and we have surveyed it from one\r\nextremity to the other.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent, not\r\neven on an island, but on an islet which was not more than two miles in\r\nlength, with even a less breadth.\r\n\r\nWas this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea-birds, strewn with\r\nstones and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more important\r\narchipelago? It was impossible to say. When the voyagers from their car\r\nsaw the land through the mist, they had not been able to reconnoiter\r\nit sufficiently. However, Pencroft, accustomed with his sailor eyes\r\nto piece through the gloom, was almost certain that he could clearly\r\ndistinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated\r\ncoast. But they could not in the dark determine whether it was a single\r\nisland, or connected with others. They could not leave it either, as the\r\nsea surrounded them; they must therefore put off till the next day their\r\nsearch for the engineer, from whom, alas! not a single cry had reached\r\nthem to show that he was still in existence.\r\n\r\n“The silence of our friend proves nothing,” said the reporter. “Perhaps\r\nhe has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply directly, so we will\r\nnot despair.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet,\r\nwhich would serve as a signal to the engineer. But they searched in vain\r\nfor wood or dry brambles; nothing but sand and stones were to be found.\r\nThe grief of Neb and his companions, who were all strongly attached to\r\nthe intrepid Harding, can be better pictured than described. It was too\r\nevident that they were powerless to help him. They must wait with what\r\npatience they could for daylight. Either the engineer had been able to\r\nsave himself, and had already found a refuge on some point of the coast,\r\nor he was lost for ever! The long and painful hours passed by. The cold\r\nwas intense. The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely perceived\r\nit. They did not even think of taking a minute’s rest. Forgetting\r\neverything but their chief, hoping or wishing to hope on, they continued\r\nto walk up and down on this sterile spot, always returning to its\r\nnorthern point, where they could approach nearest to the scene of the\r\ncatastrophe. They listened, they called, and then uniting their voices,\r\nthey endeavored to raise even a louder shout than before, which would\r\nbe transmitted to a great distance. The wind had now fallen almost to\r\na calm, and the noise of the sea began also to subside. One of Neb’s\r\nshouts even appeared to produce an echo. Herbert directed Pencroft’s\r\nattention to it, adding, “That proves that there is a coast to the west,\r\nat no great distance.” The sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not\r\ndeceive him. If he had discovered land, however indistinct it might\r\nappear, land was sure to be there. But that distant echo was the only\r\nresponse produced by Neb’s shouts, while a heavy gloom hung over all the\r\npart east of the island.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the sky was clearing little by little. Towards midnight the\r\nstars shone out, and if the engineer had been there with his companions\r\nhe would have remarked that these stars did not belong to the Northern\r\nHemisphere. The Polar Star was not visible, the constellations were not\r\nthose which they had been accustomed to see in the United States; the\r\nSouthern Cross glittered brightly in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe night passed away. Towards five o’clock in the morning of the 25th\r\nof March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still remained dark,\r\nbut with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so that the eye could\r\nscarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood. At\r\nlength the fog gradually unrolled itself in great heavily moving waves.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could distinguish\r\nnothing around them. While the gaze of the reporter and Neb were cast\r\nupon the ocean, the sailor and Herbert looked eagerly for the coast\r\nin the west. But not a speck of land was visible. “Never mind,” said\r\nPencroft, “though I do not see the land, I feel it... it is there...\r\nthere... as sure as the fact that we are no longer at Richmond.” But the\r\nfog was not long in rising. It was only a fine-weather mist. A hot\r\nsun soon penetrated to the surface of the island. About half-past\r\nsix, three-quarters of an hour after sunrise, the mist became more\r\ntransparent. It grew thicker above, but cleared away below. Soon the\r\nisle appeared as if it had descended from a cloud, then the sea showed\r\nitself around them, spreading far away towards the east, but bounded on\r\nthe west by an abrupt and precipitous coast.\r\n\r\nYes! the land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally\r\ninsured. The islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half\r\na mile in breadth, through which rushed an extremely rapid current.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his heart,\r\nimmediately threw himself into the current, without consulting his\r\ncompanions, without saying a single word. It was Neb. He was in haste\r\nto be on the other side, and to climb towards the north. It had been\r\nimpossible to hold him back. Pencroft called him in vain. The reporter\r\nprepared to follow him, but Pencroft stopped him. “Do you want to cross\r\nthe channel?” he asked. “Yes,” replied Spilett. “All right!” said the\r\nseaman; “wait a bit; Neb is well able to carry help to his master. If we\r\nventure into the channel, we risk being carried into the open sea by\r\nthe current, which is running very strong; but, if I’m not wrong, it is\r\nebbing. See, the tide is going down over the sand. Let us have patience,\r\nand at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage.” “You\r\nare right,” replied the reporter, “we will not separate more than we can\r\nhelp.”\r\n\r\nDuring this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the current. He\r\nwas crossing in an oblique direction. His black shoulders could be seen\r\nemerging at each stroke. He was carried down very quickly, but he also\r\nmade way towards the shore. It took more than half an hour to cross from\r\nthe islet to the land, and he reached the shore several hundred feet\r\nfrom the place which was opposite to the point from which he had\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nLanding at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself\r\nvigorously; and then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind\r\na rocky point, which projected to nearly the height of the northern\r\nextremity of the islet.\r\n\r\nNeb’s companions had watched his daring attempt with painful anxiety,\r\nand when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention on the land\r\nwhere their hope of safety lay, while eating some shell-fish with which\r\nthe sand was strewn. It was a wretched repast, but still it was better\r\nthan nothing. The opposite coast formed one vast bay, terminating on the\r\nsouth by a very sharp point, which was destitute of all vegetation,\r\nand was of a very wild aspect. This point abutted on the shore in a\r\ngrotesque outline of high granite rocks. Towards the north, on the\r\ncontrary, the bay widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending\r\nfrom the southwest to the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape.\r\nThe distance between these two extremities, which made the bow of the\r\nbay, was about eight miles. Half a mile from the shore rose the islet,\r\nwhich somewhat resembled the carcass of a gigantic whale. Its extreme\r\nbreadth was not more than a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nOpposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered with\r\nblack stones, which were now appearing little by little above the\r\nretreating tide. The second level was separated by a perpendicular\r\ngranite cliff, terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of\r\nat least 300 feet. It continued thus for a length of three miles, ending\r\nsuddenly on the right with a precipice which looked as if cut by the\r\nhand of man. On the left, above the promontory, this irregular and\r\njagged cliff descended by a long slope of conglomerated rocks till it\r\nmingled with the ground of the southern point. On the upper plateau of\r\nthe coast not a tree appeared. It was a flat tableland like that above\r\nCape Town at the Cape of Good Hope, but of reduced proportions; at least\r\nso it appeared seen from the islet. However, verdure was not wanting to\r\nthe right beyond the precipice. They could easily distinguish a confused\r\nmass of great trees, which extended beyond the limits of their view.\r\nThis verdure relieved the eye, so long wearied by the continued ranges\r\nof granite. Lastly, beyond and above the plateau, in a northwesterly\r\ndirection and at a distance of at least seven miles, glittered a white\r\nsummit which reflected the sun’s rays. It was that of a lofty mountain,\r\ncapped with snow.\r\n\r\nThe question could not at present be decided whether this land formed\r\nan island, or whether it belonged to a continent. But on beholding\r\nthe convulsed masses heaped up on the left, no geologist would have\r\nhesitated to give them a volcanic origin, for they were unquestionably\r\nthe work of subterranean convulsions.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this land, on\r\nwhich they might perhaps have to live many long years; on which indeed\r\nthey might even die, should it be out of the usual track of vessels, as\r\nwas likely to be the case.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked Herbert, “what do you say, Pencroft?”\r\n\r\n“There is some good and some bad, as in everything,” replied the sailor.\r\n“We shall see. But now the ebb is evidently making. In three hours we\r\nwill attempt the passage, and once on the other side, we will try to get\r\nout of this scrape, and I hope may find the captain.” Pencroft was not\r\nwrong in his anticipations. Three hours later at low tide, the greater\r\npart of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered. Between\r\nthe islet and the coast there only remained a narrow channel which would\r\nno doubt be easy to cross.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o’clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped themselves\r\nof their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their heads, and\r\nthen ventured into the water, which was not more than five feet deep.\r\nHerbert, for whom it was too deep, swam like a fish, and got through\r\ncapitally. All three arrived without difficulty on the opposite shore.\r\nQuickly drying themselves in the sun, they put on their clothes, which\r\nthey had preserved from contact with the water, and sat down to take\r\ncounsel together what to do next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nAll at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that he would\r\nrejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in the direction\r\nwhich the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before. Anxiety hastened\r\nhis steps, for he longed to obtain news of his friend, and he soon\r\ndisappeared round an angle of the cliff. Herbert wished to accompany\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Stop here, my boy,” said the sailor; “we have to prepare an encampment,\r\nand to try and find rather better grub than these shell-fish. Our\r\nfriends will want something when they come back. There is work for\r\neverybody.”\r\n\r\n“I am ready,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the sailor; “that will do. We must set about it\r\nregularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must have\r\nshelter, fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs in nests;\r\nwe have only to find a house.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” returned Herbert, “I will look for a cave among the rocks,\r\nand I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Pencroft; “go on, my boy.”\r\n\r\nThey both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach, far\r\nfrom which the tide had now retreated; but instead of going towards the\r\nnorth, they went southward. Pencroft had remarked, several hundred feet\r\nfrom the place at which they landed, a narrow cutting, out of which\r\nhe thought a river or stream might issue. Now, on the one hand it was\r\nimportant to settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good stream\r\nof water, and on the other it was possible that the current had thrown\r\nCyrus Harding on the shore there.\r\n\r\nThe cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet, but\r\nthe mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base, scarcely washed\r\nby the sea, it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as\r\na dwelling. It was a perpendicular wall of very hard granite, which even\r\nthe waves had not worn away. Towards the summit fluttered myriads of\r\nsea-fowl, and especially those of the web-footed species with long,\r\nflat, pointed beaks--a clamorous tribe, bold in the presence of man,\r\nwho probably for the first time thus invaded their domains. Pencroft\r\nrecognized the skua and other gulls among them, the voracious little\r\nsea-mew, which in great numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite.\r\nA shot fired among this swarm would have killed a great number, but to\r\nfire a shot a gun was needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one;\r\nbesides this, gulls and sea-mews are scarcely eatable, and even their\r\neggs have a detestable taste. However, Herbert, who had gone forward\r\na little more to the left, soon came upon rocks covered with sea-weed,\r\nwhich, some hours later, would be hidden by the high tide. On these\r\nrocks, in the midst of slippery wrack, abounded bivalve shell-fish, not\r\nto be despised by starving people. Herbert called Pencroft, who ran up\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n“Here are mussels!” cried the sailor; “these will do instead of eggs!”\r\n\r\n“They are not mussels,” replied Herbert, who was attentively examining\r\nthe molluscs attached to the rocks; “they are lithodomes.”\r\n\r\n“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly so.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us eat some lithodomes.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in natural\r\nhistory, and always had had quite a passion for the science. His father\r\nhad encouraged him in it, by letting him attend the lectures of the best\r\nprofessors in Boston, who were very fond of the intelligent, industrious\r\nlad. And his turn for natural history was, more than once in the course\r\nof time, of great use, and he was not mistaken in this instance. These\r\nlithodomes were oblong shells, suspended in clusters and adhering\r\nvery tightly to the rocks. They belong to that species of molluscous\r\nperforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is\r\nrounded at both ends, a feature which is not remarked in the common\r\nmussel.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which were\r\nthen half opened to the sun. They ate them as oysters, and as they had\r\na strong peppery taste, they were palatable without condiments of any\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nTheir hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their thirst, which\r\nincreased after eating these naturally-spiced molluscs. They had then to\r\nfind fresh water, and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such\r\na capriciously uneven region. Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken\r\nthe precaution of collecting an ample supply of lithodomes, with which\r\nthey filled their pockets and handkerchiefs, regained the foot of the\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through which, as\r\nPencroft had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether fresh or not was to\r\nbe ascertained. At this place the wall appeared to have been separated\r\nby some violent subterranean force. At its base was hollowed out a\r\nlittle creek, the farthest part of which formed a tolerably sharp angle.\r\nThe watercourse at that part measured one hundred feet in breadth, and\r\nits two banks on each side were scarcely twenty feet high. The river\r\nbecame strong almost directly between the two walls of granite, which\r\nbegan to sink above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared\r\nbeneath a wood of stunted trees half a mile off.\r\n\r\n“Here is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!” said Pencroft.\r\n“Well, Herbert, now we only want the house.”\r\n\r\nThe water of the river was limpid. The sailor ascertained that at this\r\ntime--that is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods did not reach\r\nit--it was sweet. This important point established, Herbert looked for\r\nsome cavity which would serve them as a retreat, but in vain; everywhere\r\nthe wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high\r\ntide, the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto, but a pile\r\nof enormous rocks, such as are often met with in granite countries and\r\nwhich bear the name of “Chimneys.”\r\n\r\nPencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by sandy\r\npassages in which light was not wanting, for it entered through the\r\nopenings which were left between the blocks, of which some were only\r\nsustained by a miracle of equilibrium; but with the light came also\r\nair--a regular corridor-gale--and with the wind the sharp cold from the\r\nexterior. However, the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of\r\nthe openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys could be\r\nrendered habitable. Their geometrical plan represented the typographical\r\nsign “&,” which signifies “et cetera” abridged, but by isolating the\r\nupper mouth of the sign, through which the south and west winds blew so\r\nstrongly, they could succeed in making the lower part of use.\r\n\r\n“Here’s our work,” said Pencroft, “and if we ever see Captain Harding\r\nagain, he will know how to make something of this labyrinth.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see him again, Pencroft,” cried Herbert, “and when he returns\r\nhe must find a tolerable dwelling here. It will be so, if we can make a\r\nfireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke.”\r\n\r\n“So we can, my boy,” replied the sailor, “and these Chimneys will serve\r\nour turn. Let us set to work, but first come and get a store of fuel. I\r\nthink some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings,\r\nthrough which the wind shrieks like so many fiends.”\r\n\r\nHerbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle, they\r\nbegan to climb the left bank of the river. The current here was quite\r\nrapid, and drifted down some dead wood. The rising tide--and it could\r\nalready be perceived--must drive it back with force to a considerable\r\ndistance. The sailor then thought that they could utilize this ebb and\r\nflow for the transport of heavy objects.\r\n\r\nAfter having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the boy\r\narrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left.\r\nFrom this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent\r\ntrees. These trees still retained their verdure, notwithstanding the\r\nadvanced season, for they belonged to the family of “coniferae,” which\r\nis spread over all the regions of the globe, from northern climates to\r\nthe tropics. The young naturalist recognized especially the “deedara,”\r\n which are very numerous in the Himalayan zone, and which spread around\r\nthem a most agreeable odor. Between these beautiful trees sprang up\r\nclusters of firs, whose opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around.\r\nAmong the long grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry\r\nbranches which crackled like fireworks.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy,” said he to Herbert, “if I don’t know the name of these\r\ntrees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them ‘burning wood,’ and\r\njust now that’s the chief thing we want.”\r\n\r\n“Let us get a supply,” replied Herbert, who immediately set to work.\r\n\r\nThe collection was easily made. It was not even necessary to lop the\r\ntrees, for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet;\r\nbut if fuel was not wanting, the means of transporting it was not yet\r\nfound. The wood, being very dry, would burn rapidly; it was therefore\r\nnecessary to carry to the Chimneys a considerable quantity, and the\r\nloads of two men would not be sufficient. Herbert remarked this.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy,” replied the sailor, “there must be some way of carrying\r\nthis wood; there is always a way of doing everything. If we had a cart\r\nor a boat, it would be easy enough.”\r\n\r\n“But we have the river,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Right,” replied Pencroft; “the river will be to us like a road which\r\ncarries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Only,” observed Herbert, “at this moment our road is going the wrong\r\nway, for the tide is rising!”\r\n\r\n“We shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs,” replied the sailor,\r\n“and then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the Chimneys. Let us get\r\nthe raft ready.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the river.\r\nThey both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a load of wood\r\nbound in fagots. They found on the bank also a great quantity of dead\r\nbranches in the midst of grass, among which the foot of man had probably\r\nnever before trod. Pencroft began directly to make his raft. In a kind\r\nof little bay, created by a point of the shore which broke the current,\r\nthe sailor and the lad placed some good-sized pieces of wood, which\r\nthey had fastened together with dry creepers. A raft was thus formed, on\r\nwhich they stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have\r\nloaded at least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the\r\nraft moored to the bank, awaited the turning of the tide.\r\n\r\nThere were still several hours to be occupied, and with one consent\r\nPencroft and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so as to have a\r\nmore extended view of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nExactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river, the wall,\r\nterminated by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle slope to the edge\r\nof the forest. It was a natural staircase. Herbert and the sailor began\r\ntheir ascent; thanks to the vigor of their muscles they reached the\r\nsummit in a few minutes; and proceeded to the point above the mouth of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nOn attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which not long\r\nbefore they had traversed in such a terrible condition. They observed,\r\nwith emotion, all that part to the north of the coast on which the\r\ncatastrophe had taken place. It was there that Cyrus Harding had\r\ndisappeared. They looked to see if some portion of their balloon, to\r\nwhich a man might possibly cling, yet existed. Nothing! The sea was but\r\none vast watery desert. As to the coast, it was solitary also. Neither\r\nthe reporter nor Neb could be anywhere seen. But it was possible that at\r\nthis time they were both too far away to be perceived.\r\n\r\n“Something tells me,” cried Herbert, “that a man as energetic as Captain\r\nHarding would not let himself be drowned like other people. He must have\r\nreached some point of the shore; don’t you think so, Pencroft?”\r\n\r\nThe sailor shook his head sadly. He little expected ever to see Cyrus\r\nHarding again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert: “Doubtless,\r\ndoubtless,” said he; “our engineer is a man who would get out of a\r\nscrape to which any one else would yield.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he examined the coast with great attention. Stretched\r\nout below them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right of the river’s\r\nmouth by lines of breakers. The rocks which were visible appeared like\r\namphibious monsters reposing in the surf. Beyond the reef, the sea\r\nsparkled beneath the sun’s rays. To the south a sharp point closed the\r\nhorizon, and it could not be seen if the land was prolonged in that\r\ndirection, or if it ran southeast and southwest, which would have made\r\nthis coast a very long peninsula. At the northern extremity of the bay\r\nthe outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider\r\ncurve. There the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great\r\nbanks of sand, which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then\r\nreturned towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the\r\nsnow-topped mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven miles.\r\nFrom its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread\r\nvast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the\r\npresence of evergreen trees. Then, from the edge of this forest to the\r\nshore extended a plain, scattered irregularly with groups of trees. Here\r\nand there on the left sparkled through glades the waters of the little\r\nriver; they could trace its winding course back towards the spurs of the\r\nmountain, among which it seemed to spring. At the point where the sailor\r\nhad left his raft of wood, it began to run between the two high granite\r\nwalls; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt, on\r\nthe right bank, on the contrary, it sank gradually, the massive sides\r\nchanged to isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the stones to shingle\r\nrunning to the extremity of the point.\r\n\r\n“Are we on an island?” murmured the sailor.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, it seems to be big enough,” replied the lad.\r\n\r\n“An island, ever so big, is an island all the same!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\nBut this important question could not yet be answered. A more perfect\r\nsurvey had to be made to settle the point. As to the land itself, island\r\nor continent, it appeared fertile, agreeable in its aspect, and varied\r\nin its productions.\r\n\r\n“This is satisfactory,” observed Pencroft; “and in our misfortune, we\r\nmust thank Providence for it.”\r\n\r\n“God be praised!” responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of\r\ngratitude to the Author of all things.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which\r\nthey had been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an\r\ninspection what the future had in store for them.\r\n\r\nThey then returned, following the southern crest of the granite\r\nplatform, bordered by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most\r\nwhimsical shapes. Some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the\r\nholes of the stone; Herbert, jumping over the rocks, startled a whole\r\nflock of these winged creatures.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried he, “those are not gulls nor sea-mews!”\r\n\r\n“What are they then?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, one would say they were pigeons!”\r\n\r\n“Just so, but these are wild or rock pigeons. I recognize them by\r\nthe double band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by their\r\nslate-colored plumage. But if the rock-pigeon is good to eat, its eggs\r\nmust be excellent, and we will soon see how many they may have left in\r\ntheir nests!”\r\n\r\n“We will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape of an\r\nomelet!” replied Pencroft merrily.\r\n\r\n“But what will you make your omelet in?” asked Herbert; “in your hat?”\r\n\r\n“Well!” replied the sailor, “I am not quite conjuror enough for that;\r\nwe must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will undertake to\r\ndespatch the hardest!”\r\n\r\nPencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the granite,\r\nand they really found eggs in some of the hollows. A few dozen being\r\ncollected, were packed in the sailor’s handkerchief, and as the time\r\nwhen the tide would be full was approaching, Pencroft and Herbert began\r\nto redescend towards the watercourse. When they arrived there, it was\r\nan hour after midday. The tide had already turned. They must now avail\r\nthemselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth. Pencroft did not\r\nintend to let the raft go away in the current without guidance, neither\r\ndid he mean to embark on it himself to steer it. But a sailor is never\r\nat a loss when there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft\r\nrapidly twisted a cord, a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers. This\r\nvegetable cable was fastened to the after-part of the raft, and the\r\nsailor held it in his hand while Herbert, pushing off the raft with\r\na long pole, kept it in the current. This succeeded capitally. The\r\nenormous load of wood drifted down the current. The bank was very\r\nequal; there was no fear that the raft would run aground, and before\r\ntwo o’clock they arrived at the river’s mouth, a few paces from the\r\nChimneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nPencroft’s first care, after unloading the raft, was to render the cave\r\nhabitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty. Sand,\r\nstones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the galleries open to the\r\nsouth winds. One narrow and winding opening at the side was kept, to\r\nlead out the smoke and to make the fire draw. The cave was thus divided\r\ninto three or four rooms, if such dark dens with which a donkey would\r\nscarcely have been contented deserved the name. But they were dry, and\r\nthere was space to stand upright, at least in the principal room, which\r\noccupied the center. The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking\r\nall in all they were well pleased with it for want of a better.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working, “our\r\ncompanions have found a superior place to ours.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” replied the seaman; “but, as we don’t know, we must work\r\nall the same. Better to have two strings to one’s bow than no string at\r\nall!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Herbert, “how jolly it will be if they were to find\r\nCaptain Harding and were to bring him back with them!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed!” said Pencroft, “that was a man of the right sort.”\r\n\r\n“Was!” exclaimed Herbert, “do you despair of ever seeing him again?”\r\n\r\n“God forbid!” replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and Pencroft\r\ndeclared himself very well satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he, “our friends can come back when they like. They will\r\nfind a good enough shelter.”\r\n\r\nThey now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper--an easy\r\ntask. Large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of the\r\nnarrow passage which had been kept. This, if the smoke did not take\r\nthe heat out with it, would be enough to maintain an equal temperature\r\ninside. Their wood was stowed away in one of the rooms, and the sailor\r\nlaid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood. The seaman was busy with\r\nthis, when Herbert asked him if he had any matches.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Pencroft, “and I may say happily, for without\r\nmatches or tinder we should be in a fix.”\r\n\r\n“Still we might get fire as the savages do,” replied Herbert, “by\r\nrubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other.”\r\n\r\n“All right; try, my boy, and let’s see if you can do anything besides\r\nexercising your arms.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s a very simple proceeding, and much used in the islands of\r\nthe Pacific.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t deny it,” replied Pencroft, “but the savages must know how to\r\ndo it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have tried to\r\nget fire in that way, but I could never manage it. I must say I prefer\r\nmatches. By the bye, where are my matches?”\r\n\r\nPencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always there,\r\nfor he was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he rummaged the\r\npockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could nowhere discover\r\nthe box.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a go!” said he, looking at Herbert. “The box must have\r\nfallen out of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must have\r\nsomething--a tinder-box--anything that can possibly make fire!”\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor rushed out, followed by the boy. On the sand, among the\r\nrocks, near the river’s bank, they both searched carefully, but in vain.\r\nThe box was of copper, and therefore would have been easily seen.\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” asked Herbert, “didn’t you throw it out of the car?”\r\n\r\n“I knew better than that,” replied the sailor; “but such a small article\r\ncould easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone through. I\r\nwould rather even have lost my pipe! Confound the box! Where can it be?”\r\n\r\n“Look here, the tide is going down,” said Herbert; “let’s run to the\r\nplace where we landed.”\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the waves\r\nhad rolled about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was as well\r\nto try. Herbert and Pencroft walked rapidly to the point where they had\r\nlanded the day before, about two hundred feet from the cave. They hunted\r\nthere, among the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks, but found nothing.\r\nIf the box had fallen at this place it must have been swept away by the\r\nwaves. As the sea went down, they searched every little crevice with\r\nno result. It was a grave loss in their circumstances, and for the\r\ntime irreparable. Pencroft could not hide his vexation; he looked very\r\nanxious, but said not a word. Herbert tried to console him by observing,\r\nthat if they had found the matches, they would, very likely, have been\r\nwetted by the sea and useless.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy,” replied the sailor; “they were in a copper box which shut\r\nvery tightly; and now what are we to do?”\r\n\r\n“We shall certainly find some way of making a fire,” said Herbert.\r\n“Captain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft; “but in the meantime we are without fire, and\r\nour companions will find but a sorry repast on their return.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Herbert quickly, “do you think it possible that they have no\r\ntinder or matches?”\r\n\r\n“I doubt it,” replied the sailor, shaking his head, “for neither Neb nor\r\nCaptain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would rather keep\r\nhis note-book than his match-box.”\r\n\r\nHerbert did not reply. The loss of the box was certainly to be\r\nregretted, but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way or\r\nother. Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he was not\r\na man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance. At any rate,\r\nthere was only one thing to be done--to await the return of Neb and the\r\nreporter; but they must give up the feast of hard eggs which they had\r\nmeant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh was not an agreeable prospect\r\neither for themselves or for the others.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the event of\r\nfire being positively unattainable, collected some more shell-fish, and\r\nthen silently retraced their steps to their dwelling.\r\n\r\nPencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his box. He\r\neven climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth to the angle\r\nwhere the raft had been moored. He returned to the plateau, went over it\r\nin every direction, searched among the high grass on the border of the\r\nforest, all in vain.\r\n\r\nIt was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the cave.\r\nIt is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages were\r\nransacked before they were obliged to give it up in despair. Towards\r\nsix o’clock, when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the\r\nwest, Herbert, who was walking up and down on the strand, signalized the\r\nreturn of Neb and Spilett.\r\n\r\nThey were returning alone!... The boy’s heart sank; the sailor had not\r\nbeen deceived in his forebodings; the engineer, Cyrus Harding, had not\r\nbeen found!\r\n\r\nThe reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying\r\nanything. Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not strength\r\nto utter a word.\r\n\r\nAs to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears which he\r\ncould not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope.\r\n\r\nThe reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to\r\nrecover Cyrus Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a distance\r\nof eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon\r\nhad fallen the last time but one, a fall which was followed by the\r\ndisappearance of the engineer and the dog Top. The shore was solitary;\r\nnot a vestige of a mark. Not even a pebble recently displaced; not a\r\ntrace on the sand; not a human footstep on all that part of the beach.\r\nIt was clear that that portion of the shore had never been visited by\r\na human being. The sea was as deserted as the land, and it was there,\r\na few hundred feet from the coast, that the engineer must have found a\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nAs Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a voice which\r\nshowed how hope struggled within him, “No! he is not dead! he can’t be\r\ndead! It might happen to any one else, but never to him! He could get\r\nout of anything!” Then his strength forsaking him, “Oh! I can do no\r\nmore!” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Neb,” said Herbert, running to him, “we will find him! God will give\r\nhim back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you must eat\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of shell-fish, which\r\nwas indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb had not eaten anything\r\nfor several hours, but he refused them. He could not, would not live\r\nwithout his master.\r\n\r\nAs to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid himself\r\ndown on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak, but calm.\r\nHerbert went up to him, and taking his hand, “Sir,” said he, “we\r\nhave found a shelter which will be better than lying here. Night is\r\nadvancing. Come and rest! To-morrow we will search farther.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the cave. On\r\nthe way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if by chance he\r\nhappened to have a match or two.\r\n\r\nThe reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing said, “I\r\nhad some, but I must have thrown them away.”\r\n\r\nThe seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the same\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” exclaimed the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe reporter heard him and seizing his arm, “Have you no matches?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Not one, and no fire in consequence.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Neb, “if my master was here, he would know what to do!”\r\n\r\nThe four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each other.\r\nHerbert was the first to break the silence by saying, “Mr. Spilett,\r\nyou are a smoker and always have matches about you; perhaps you haven’t\r\nlooked well, try again, a single match will be enough!”\r\n\r\nThe reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers, waistcoat, and\r\ngreat-coat, and at last to Pencroft’s great joy, no less to his extreme\r\nsurprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood entangled in the lining of his\r\nwaistcoat. He seized it with his fingers through the stuff, but he could\r\nnot get it out. If this was a match and a single one, it was of great\r\nimportance not to rub off the phosphorus.\r\n\r\n“Will you let me try?” said the boy, and very cleverly, without breaking\r\nit, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious little bit of wood\r\nwhich was of such great importance to these poor men. It was unused.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft; “it is as good as having a whole cargo!” He\r\ntook the match, and, followed by his companions, entered the cave.\r\n\r\nThis small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited country are\r\nwasted with indifference and are of no value, must here be used with the\r\ngreatest caution.\r\n\r\nThe sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, “We must\r\nhave some paper,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Here,” replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his\r\nnote-book.\r\n\r\nPencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him, and\r\nknelt down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry\r\nmoss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the\r\nair could easily circulate, and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire.\r\n\r\nPencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a cone, as\r\nsmokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss. Taking a\r\nsmall, rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a beating heart,\r\nholding his breath, he gently rubbed the match. The first attempt did\r\nnot produce any effect. Pencroft had not struck hard enough, fearing to\r\nrub off the phosphorus.\r\n\r\n“No, I can’t do it,” said he, “my hand trembles, the match has missed\r\nfire; I cannot, I will not!” and rising, he told Herbert to take his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nCertainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous. Prometheus\r\ngoing to steal the fire from heaven could not have been more anxious. He\r\ndid not hesitate, however, but struck the match directly.\r\n\r\nA little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up, making\r\na choking smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to augment the\r\nflame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which in a few seconds\r\ntoo caught fire, and then the moss.\r\n\r\nA minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame, assisted\r\nby the vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the midst of the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n“At last!” cried Pencroft, getting up; “I was never so nervous before in\r\nall my life!”\r\n\r\nThe flat stones made a capital fireplace. The smoke went quite easily\r\nout at the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an agreeable warmth was\r\nnot long in being felt.\r\n\r\nThey must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and always to\r\nkeep some embers alight. It only needed care and attention, as they had\r\nplenty of wood and could renew their store at any time.\r\n\r\nPencroft’s first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more\r\nnourishing supper than a dish of shell-fish. Two dozen eggs were\r\nbrought by Herbert. The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched these\r\npreparations without saying anything. A threefold thought weighed on his\r\nmind. Was Cyrus still alive? If he was alive, where was he? If he had\r\nsurvived from his fall, how was it that he had not found some means of\r\nmaking known his existence? As to Neb, he was roaming about the shore.\r\nHe was like a body without a soul.\r\n\r\nPencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had no\r\nchoice, and was obliged to content himself with roasting them under\r\nthe hot cinders. In a few minutes the cooking was done, and the seaman\r\ninvited the reporter to take his share of the supper. Such was the\r\nfirst repast of the castaways on this unknown coast. The hard eggs\r\nwere excellent, and as eggs contain everything indispensable to man’s\r\nnourishment, these poor people thought themselves well off, and were\r\nmuch strengthened by them. Oh! if only one of them had not been missing\r\nat this meal! If the five prisoners who escaped from Richmond had been\r\nall there, under the piled-up rocks, before this clear, crackling fire\r\non the dry sand, what thanksgiving must they have rendered to Heaven!\r\nBut the most ingenious, the most learned, he who was their unquestioned\r\nchief, Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing, and his body had not even\r\nobtained a burial-place.\r\n\r\nThus passed the 25th of March. Night had come on. Outside could be heard\r\nthe howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking\r\non the shore. The waves rolled the shingle backwards and forwards with a\r\ndeafening noise.\r\n\r\nThe reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly noted down\r\nthe occurrences of the day; the first appearance of this new land, the\r\nloss of their leader, the exploration of the coast, the incident of the\r\nmatches, etc.; and then overcome by fatigue, he managed to forget his\r\nsorrows in sleep. Herbert went to sleep directly. As to the sailor, he\r\npassed the night with one eye on the fire, on which he did not\r\nspare fuel. But one of the castaways did not sleep in the cave. The\r\ninconsolable, despairing Neb, notwithstanding all that his companions\r\ncould say to induce him to take some rest, wandered all night long on\r\nthe shore calling on his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nThe inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the\r\nclouds, thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited, was soon\r\nmade out. They had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at\r\nthe time of the catastrophe. We must mention, however, a note-book and\r\na watch which Gideon Spilett had kept, doubtless by inadvertence, not a\r\nweapon, not a tool, not even a pocket-knife; for while in the car they\r\nhad thrown out everything to lighten the balloon. The imaginary heroes\r\nof Daniel Defoe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal shipwrecked\r\non Juan Fernandez and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never in\r\nsuch absolute destitution. Either they had abundant resources from their\r\nstranded vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some\r\nthings were thrown up on the coast which supplied them with all the\r\nfirst necessities of life. But here, not any instrument whatever, not a\r\nutensil. From nothing they must supply themselves with everything.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer could\r\nhave brought his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their\r\nsituation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost. Alas! they must\r\nhope no longer again to see Cyrus Harding. The castaways could expect\r\nnothing but from themselves and from that Providence which never\r\nabandons those whose faith is sincere.\r\n\r\nBut ought they to establish themselves on this part of the coast,\r\nwithout trying to know to what continent it belonged, if it was\r\ninhabited, or if they were on the shore of a desert island?\r\n\r\nIt was an important question, and should be solved with the shortest\r\npossible delay. From its answer they would know what measures to take.\r\nHowever, according to Pencroft’s advice, it appeared best to wait a few\r\ndays before commencing an exploration. They must, in fact, prepare some\r\nprovisions and procure more strengthening food than eggs and molluscs.\r\nThe explorers, before undertaking new fatigues, must first of all\r\nrecruit their strength.\r\n\r\nThe Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present. The fire was\r\nlighted, and it was easy to preserve some embers. There were plenty of\r\nshell-fish and eggs among the rocks and on the beach. It would be easy\r\nto kill a few of the pigeons which were flying by hundreds about the\r\nsummit of the plateau, either with sticks or stones. Perhaps the trees\r\nof the neighboring forest would supply them with eatable fruit. Lastly,\r\nthe sweet water was there.\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain at the\r\nChimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along\r\nthe shore or into the interior of the country. This plan suited Neb\r\nparticularly. As obstinate in his ideas as in his presentiments, he\r\nwas in no haste to abandon this part of the coast, the scene of the\r\ncatastrophe. He did not, he would not believe in the loss of Cyrus\r\nHarding. No, it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended\r\nin this vulgar fashion, carried away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a\r\nfew hundred feet from a shore. As long as the waves had not cast up the\r\nbody of the engineer, as long as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes,\r\ntouched with his hands the corpse of his master, he would not believe\r\nin his death! And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his\r\ndetermined heart. An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be\r\nrespected, and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy. As for him,\r\nhe hoped no longer, but there was no use in arguing with Neb. He was\r\nlike the dog who will not leave the place where his master is buried,\r\nand his grief was such that most probably he would not survive him.\r\n\r\nThis same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set out on\r\nthe shore in a northerly direction, and he had returned to the spot\r\nwhere the sea, no doubt, had closed over the unfortunate Harding.\r\n\r\nThat day’s breakfast was composed solely of pigeon’s eggs and\r\nlithodomes. Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in the\r\nhollows of the rocks, and this mineral was very welcome.\r\n\r\nThe repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to accompany\r\nHerbert and himself to the forest, where they were going to try to\r\nhunt. But on consideration, it was thought necessary that someone should\r\nremain to keep in the fire, and to be at hand in the highly improbable\r\nevent of Neb requiring aid. The reporter accordingly remained behind.\r\n\r\n“To the chase, Herbert,” said the sailor. “We shall find ammunition\r\non our way, and cut our weapons in the forest.” But at the moment of\r\nstarting, Herbert observed, that since they had no tinder, it would\r\nperhaps be prudent to replace it by another substance.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Burnt linen,” replied the boy. “That could in case of need serve for\r\ntinder.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor thought it very sensible advice. Only it had the\r\ninconvenience of necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief.\r\nNotwithstanding, the thing was well worth while trying, and a part of\r\nPencroft’s large checked handkerchief was soon reduced to the state of\r\na half-burnt rag. This inflammable material was placed in the central\r\nchamber at the bottom of a little cavity in the rock, sheltered from all\r\nwind and damp.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o’clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and the\r\nbreeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of\r\nthe Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at\r\nthat place, curled round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nArrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout\r\nbranches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert\r\nrubbed smooth on a rock. Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!\r\n\r\nThe two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the bank.\r\nFrom the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river\r\nnarrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks, over\r\nwhich the trees formed a double arch. Pencroft, lest they should lose\r\nthemselves, resolved to follow the course of the stream, which would\r\nalways lead them back to the point from which they started. But the bank\r\nwas not without some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the trees\r\nbent level with the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had\r\nto break down with their sticks. Herbert often glided among the\r\nbroken stumps with the agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the\r\nunderwood. But Pencroft called him back directly, begging him not to\r\nwander away. Meanwhile, the sailor attentively observed the disposition\r\nand nature of the surrounding country. On the left bank, the ground,\r\nwhich was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior. It\r\nlooked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless reached\r\nthe river by some underground drain. Sometimes a stream ran through the\r\nunderwood, which they crossed without difficulty. The opposite shore\r\nappeared to be more uneven, and the valley of which the river occupied\r\nthe bottom was more clearly visible. The hill, covered with trees\r\ndisposed in terraces, intercepted the view. On the right bank walking\r\nwould have been difficult, for the declivities fell suddenly, and the\r\ntrees bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of\r\ntheir roots.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already\r\nsurveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft only saw\r\ntraces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not\r\nrecognize the species. In all probability, and such was also Herbert’s\r\nopinion, some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless\r\nwould give them some trouble; but nowhere did they observe the mark of\r\nan axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a\r\nhuman foot. On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on\r\nany land in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps\r\nmore to be feared than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little,\r\nfor the difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and\r\nafter walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile.\r\nAs yet the hunt had not been successful. However, some birds sang\r\nand fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had\r\ninspired them with an instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert described,\r\nin a marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely\r\nresembling the king-fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a\r\nmetallic brilliancy.\r\n\r\n“That must be a jacamar,” said Herbert, trying to get nearer.\r\n\r\n“This will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar,” replied the sailor,\r\n“if that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!”\r\n\r\nJust then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the creature on\r\nthe wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the jacamar ran off and\r\ndisappeared in an instant.\r\n\r\n“How clumsy I am!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“No, no, my boy!” replied the sailor. “The blow was well aimed; many a\r\none would have missed it altogether! Come, don’t be vexed with yourself.\r\nWe shall catch it another day!”\r\n\r\nAs the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more scattered, many\r\nbeing magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit. Pencroft searched in\r\nvain for some of those precious palm-trees which are employed in so many\r\nways in domestic life, and which have been found as far as the fortieth\r\nparallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in\r\nthe Southern Hemisphere. But this forest was only composed of coniferae,\r\nsuch as deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine,\r\nsimilar to those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and\r\nsplendid firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty plumage,\r\nwith long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the branches\r\nstrewing their feathers, which covered the ground as with fine down.\r\nHerbert picked up a few of these feathers, and after having examined\r\nthem,--\r\n\r\n“These are couroucous,” said he.\r\n\r\n“I should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl,” replied Pencroft, “still,\r\nif they are good to eat--”\r\n\r\n“They are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,” replied\r\nHerbert. “Besides, if I don’t mistake, it is easy to approach and kill\r\nthem with a stick.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the foot\r\nof a tree, whose lower branches were covered with little birds. The\r\ncouroucous were waiting the passage of insects which served for their\r\nnourishment. Their feathery feet could be seen clasping the slender\r\ntwigs which supported them.\r\n\r\nThe hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they mowed\r\ndown whole rows of these couroucous, who never thought of flying away,\r\nand stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off. A hundred were\r\nalready heaped on the ground, before the others made up their minds to\r\nfly.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroft, “here is game, which is quite within the reach of\r\nhunters like us. We have only to put out our hands and take it!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs,\r\nthey then continued their exploration. The stream here made a bend\r\ntowards the south, but this detour was probably not prolonged for the\r\nriver must have its source in the mountain, and be supplied by the\r\nmelting of the snow which covered the sides of the central cone.\r\n\r\nThe particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to\r\nprocure the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of\r\nthe Chimneys. It must be acknowledged that as yet this object had not\r\nbeen attained. So the sailor actively pursued his researches, though he\r\nexclaimed, when some animal which he had not even time to recognize\r\nfled into the long grass, “If only we had had the dog Top!” But Top had\r\ndisappeared at the same time as his master, and had probably perished\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nTowards three o’clock new flocks of birds were seen through certain\r\ntrees, at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those of the\r\njuniper-tree among others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded\r\nthrough the forest. This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game\r\nbird called grouse in the United States. They soon saw several couples,\r\nwhose plumage was rich chestnut-brown mottled with dark brown, and tail\r\nof the same color. Herbert recognized the males by the two wing-like\r\nappendages raised on the neck. Pencroft determined to get hold of at\r\nleast one of these gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose\r\nflesh is better than that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they\r\nwould not allow themselves to be approached. After several fruitless\r\nattempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor\r\nsaid to the lad,--\r\n\r\n“Decidedly, since we can’t kill them on the wing, we must try to take\r\nthem with a line.”\r\n\r\n“Like a fish?” cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal.\r\n\r\n“Like a fish,” replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had found\r\namong the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four\r\neggs. He took great care not to touch these nests, to which their\r\nproprietors would not fail to return. It was around these that he\r\nmeant to stretch his lines, not snares, but real fishing-lines. He took\r\nHerbert to some distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular\r\napparatus with all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would\r\nhave used. Herbert watched the work with great interest, though rather\r\ndoubting its success. The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened\r\none to the other, of the length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong\r\nthorns, the points bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia\r\nbush) were fastened to the ends of the creepers, by way of hooks. Large\r\nred worms, which were crawling on the ground, furnished bait.\r\n\r\nThis done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself\r\nskillfully, placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse\r\nnests; then he returned, took the other ends and hid with Herbert behind\r\na large tree. There they both waited patiently; though, it must be\r\nsaid, that Herbert did not reckon much on the success of the inventive\r\nPencroft.\r\n\r\nA whole half-hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised, several\r\ncouple of grouse returned to their nests. They walked along, pecking the\r\nground, and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters,\r\nwho, besides, had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the\r\ngallinaceae.\r\n\r\nThe lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his breath, and\r\nPencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips advanced, as if\r\nabout to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely breathed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any notice\r\nof them. Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait as if the\r\nworms had been still alive.\r\n\r\nThe sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the\r\nfisherman, for he does not see his prey coming through the water. The\r\njerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the\r\nhooks with their beaks. Three voracious grouse swallowed at the same\r\nmoment bait and hook. Suddenly with a smart jerk, Pencroft “struck” his\r\nline, and a flapping of wings showed that the birds were taken.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made himself\r\nmaster in an instant.\r\n\r\nHerbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had ever seen\r\nbirds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly confessed that it was\r\nnot his first attempt, and that besides he could not claim the merit of\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n“And at any rate,” added he, “situated as we are, we must hope to hit\r\nupon many other contrivances.”\r\n\r\nThe grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted at not\r\nhaving to appear before their companions with empty hands, and observing\r\nthat the day had begun to decline, judged it best to return to their\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nThe direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had only\r\nto follow, and, towards six o’clock, tired enough with their excursion,\r\nHerbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett was standing motionless on the shore, his arms crossed,\r\ngazing over the sea, the horizon of which was lost towards the east in\r\na thick black cloud which was spreading rapidly towards the zenith.\r\nThe wind was already strong, and increased with the decline of day.\r\nThe whole sky was of a threatening aspect, and the first symptoms of a\r\nviolent storm were clearly visible.\r\n\r\nHerbert entered the Chimneys, and Pencroft went towards the reporter.\r\nThe latter, deeply absorbed, did not see him approach.\r\n\r\n“We are going to have a dirty night, Mr. Spilett!” said the sailor:\r\n“Petrels delight in wind and rain.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter, turning at the moment, saw Pencroft, and his first words\r\nwere,--\r\n\r\n“At what distance from the coast would you say the car was, when the\r\nwaves carried off our companion?”\r\n\r\nThe sailor had not expected this question. He reflected an instant and\r\nreplied,--\r\n\r\n“Two cables lengths at the most.”\r\n\r\n“But what is a cable’s length?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“About a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the reporter, “Cyrus Harding must have disappeared twelve\r\nhundred feet at the most from the shore?”\r\n\r\n“About that,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“And his dog also?”\r\n\r\n“Also.”\r\n\r\n“What astonishes me,” rejoined the reporter, “while admitting that our\r\ncompanion has perished, is that Top has also met his death, and that\r\nneither the body of the dog nor of his master has been cast on the\r\nshore!”\r\n\r\n“It is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea,” replied the sailor.\r\n“Besides, it is possible that currents have carried them farther down\r\nthe coast.”\r\n\r\n“Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?”\r\n again asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“That is my opinion.”\r\n\r\n“My own opinion,” said Gideon Spilett, “with due deference to your\r\nexperience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the absolute\r\ndisappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is something\r\nunaccountable and unlikely.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett,” replied Pencroft;\r\n“unhappily, my mind is made up on this point.” Having said this, the\r\nsailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the hearth.\r\nHerbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the flame cast a\r\nbright light into the darkest parts of the passage.\r\n\r\nPencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared best to\r\nintroduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all needed to get\r\nup their strength. The strings of couroucous were kept for the next day,\r\nbut they plucked a couple of grouse, which were soon spitted on a stick,\r\nand roasting before a blazing fire.\r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged absence of\r\nthe Negro made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared that he had met\r\nwith an accident on this unknown land, or that the unhappy fellow had\r\nbeen driven to some act of despair. But Herbert drew very different\r\nconclusions from this absence. According to him, Neb’s delay was caused\r\nby some new circumstances which had induced him to prolong his search.\r\nAlso, everything new must be to the advantage of Cyrus Harding. Why had\r\nNeb not returned unless hope still detained him? Perhaps he had found\r\nsome mark, a footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path.\r\nPerhaps he was at this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was\r\nnear his master.\r\n\r\nThus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him talk. The\r\nreporter alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft thought most\r\nprobable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther\r\nthan the day before, and that he had not as yet had time to return.\r\n\r\nHerbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times\r\nmanifested an intention to go to meet Neb. But Pencroft assured him\r\nthat that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and deplorable\r\nweather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it would be much\r\nbetter to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance by the next day,\r\nPencroft would not hesitate to join him in his search.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett approved of the sailor’s opinion that it was best not to\r\ndivide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but two large\r\ntears fell from his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy.\r\n\r\nBad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed over\r\nthe coast. The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain was\r\ndashed by the storm into particles like dust. Ragged masses of vapor\r\ndrove along the beach, on which the tormented shingles sounded as if\r\npoured out in cart-loads, while the sand raised by the wind added as\r\nit were mineral dust to that which was liquid, and rendered the united\r\nattack insupportable. Between the river’s mouth and the end of the\r\ncliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the\r\nwater which ran through the narrow valley. The smoke from the fireplace\r\nwas also driven back through the opening, filling the passages and\r\nrendering them uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die away,\r\nand only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt that the\r\nfrightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he must have\r\ntaken refuge in some cave, to await the end of the storm or at least the\r\nreturn of day. As to going to meet him, or attempting to find him, it\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\nThe game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was excellent,\r\nand Pencroft and Herbert, whose long excursion had rendered them very\r\nhungry, devoured it with infinite satisfaction.\r\n\r\nTheir meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had rested\r\nthe preceding night, and Herbert was not long in going to sleep near the\r\nsailor, who had stretched himself beside the fireplace.\r\n\r\nOutside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in strength,\r\nuntil it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from Richmond\r\nto this land in the Pacific. The tempests which are frequent during the\r\nseasons of the equinox, and which are so prolific in catastrophes, are\r\nabove all terrible over this immense ocean, which opposes no obstacle to\r\ntheir fury. No description can give an idea of the terrific violence of\r\nthe gale as it beat upon the unprotected coast.\r\n\r\nHappily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid. It was\r\ncomposed of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which, insecurely\r\nbalanced, seemed to tremble on their foundations, and Pencroft could\r\nfeel rapid quiverings under his head as it rested on the rock. But he\r\nrepeated to himself, and rightly, that there was nothing to fear, and\r\nthat their retreat would not give way. However he heard the noise of\r\nstones torn from the summit of the plateau by the wind, falling down on\r\nto the beach. A few even rolled on to the upper part of the Chimneys,\r\nor flew off in fragments when they were projected perpendicularly. Twice\r\nthe sailor rose and intrenched himself at the opening of the passage, so\r\nas to take a look in safety at the outside. But there was nothing to be\r\nfeared from these showers, which were not considerable, and he returned\r\nto his couch before the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath the\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest,\r\nthe thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly. Sleep at last\r\ntook possession of Pencroft, whom a seafaring life had habituated to\r\nanything. Gideon Spilett alone was kept awake by anxiety. He reproached\r\nhimself with not having accompanied Neb. It was evident that he had not\r\nabandoned all hope. The presentiments which had troubled Herbert did not\r\ncease to agitate him also. His thoughts were concentrated on Neb. Why\r\nhad Neb not returned? He tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely\r\ngiving a thought to the struggle of the elements. Now and then, his\r\neyes, heavy with fatigue, closed for an instant, but some sudden thought\r\nreopened them almost immediately.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from morning,\r\nwhen Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously shaken.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” he cried, rousing himself, and collecting his ideas\r\nwith the promptitude usual to seamen.\r\n\r\nThe reporter was leaning over him, and saying,--\r\n\r\n“Listen, Pencroft, listen!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond those\r\ncaused by the storm.\r\n\r\n“It is the wind,” said he.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Gideon Spilett, listening again, “I thought I heard--”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“The barking of a dog!”\r\n\r\n“A dog!” cried Pencroft, springing up.\r\n\r\n“Yes--barking--”\r\n\r\n“It’s not possible!” replied the sailor. “And besides, how, in the\r\nroaring of the storm--”\r\n\r\n“Stop--listen--” said the reporter.\r\n\r\nPencroft listened more attentively, and really thought he heard, during\r\na lull, distant barking.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said the reporter, pressing the sailor’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes--yes!” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“It is Top! It is Top!” cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all three\r\nrushed towards the opening of the Chimneys. They had great difficulty in\r\ngetting out. The wind drove them back. But at last they succeeded, and\r\ncould only remain standing by leaning against the rocks. They looked\r\nabout, but could not speak. The darkness was intense. The sea, the sky,\r\nthe land were all mingled in one black mass. Not a speck of light was\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThe reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes,\r\noverwhelmed by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand.\r\n\r\nThen, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking, which they\r\nfound must be at some distance.\r\n\r\nIt could only be Top! But was he alone or accompanied? He was most\r\nprobably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made\r\nhis way more directly towards the Chimneys. The sailor squeezed the\r\nreporter’s hand, for he could not make himself heard, in a way which\r\nsignified “Wait!” then he reentered the passage.\r\n\r\nAn instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the\r\ndarkness, whistling shrilly.\r\n\r\nIt appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking\r\nimmediately came nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage.\r\nPencroft, Herbert, and Spilett entered after him.\r\n\r\nAn armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers. The passage was lighted\r\nup with a bright flame.\r\n\r\n“It is Top!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, who derived from these\r\ntwo races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which\r\nare the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs. It was the dog of the\r\nengineer, Cyrus Harding. But he was alone! Neither Neb nor his master\r\naccompanied him!\r\n\r\nHow was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the Chimneys,\r\nwhich he did not know? It appeared inexplicable, above all, in the\r\nmidst of this black night and in such a tempest! But what was still more\r\ninexplicable was, that Top was neither tired, nor exhausted, nor even\r\nsoiled with mud or sand!--Herbert had drawn him towards him, and was\r\npatting his head, the dog rubbing his neck against the lad’s hands.\r\n\r\n“If the dog is found, the master will be found also!” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“God grant it!” responded Herbert. “Let us set off! Top will guide us!”\r\n\r\nPencroft did not make any objection. He felt that Top’s arrival\r\ncontradicted his conjectures. “Come along then!” said he.\r\n\r\nPencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth. He placed a few\r\npieces of wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until their return.\r\nThen, preceded by the dog, who seemed to invite them by short barks to\r\ncome with him, and followed by the reporter and the boy, he dashed out,\r\nafter having put up in his handkerchief the remains of the supper.\r\n\r\nThe storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its height. Not a\r\nsingle ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds. To follow\r\na straight course was difficult. It was best to rely on Top’s instinct.\r\nThey did so. The reporter and Herbert walked behind the dog, and the\r\nsailor brought up the rear. It was impossible to exchange a word. The\r\nrain was not very heavy, but the wind was terrific.\r\n\r\nHowever, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two companions. The\r\nwind being southeast, consequently blew on their backs. The clouds of\r\nsand, which otherwise would have been insupportable, from being received\r\nbehind, did not in consequence impede their progress. In short, they\r\nsometimes went faster than they liked, and had some difficulty in\r\nkeeping their feet; but hope gave them strength, for it was not at\r\nrandom that they made their way along the shore. They had no doubt that\r\nNeb had found his master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog.\r\nBut was the engineer living, or had Neb only sent for his companions\r\nthat they might render the last duties to the corpse of the unfortunate\r\nHarding?\r\n\r\nAfter having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and Pencroft\r\nprudently stepped aside to stop and take breath. The turn of the rocks\r\nsheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe after this walk or\r\nrather run of a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nThey could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having\r\npronounced the name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks, as\r\nmuch as to say that his master was saved.\r\n\r\n“Saved, isn’t he?” repeated Herbert; “saved, Top?”\r\n\r\nAnd the dog barked in reply.\r\n\r\nThey once more set out. The tide began to rise, and urged by the wind it\r\nthreatened to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide. Great billows\r\nthundered against the reef with such violence that they probably passed\r\nentirely over the islet, then quite invisible. The mole no longer\r\nprotected the coast, which was directly exposed to the attacks of the\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the wind\r\nstruck them again with renewed fury. Though bent under the gale they\r\nwalked very quickly, following Top, who did not hesitate as to what\r\ndirection to take.\r\n\r\nThey ascended towards the north, having on their left an interminable\r\nextent of billows, which broke with a deafening noise, and on their\r\nright a dark country, the aspect of which it was impossible to guess.\r\nBut they felt that it was comparatively flat, for the wind passed\r\ncompletely over them, without being driven back as it was when it came\r\nin contact with the cliff.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had cleared\r\nabout five miles. The clouds were slightly raised, and the wind, though\r\nless damp, was very sharp and cold. Insufficiently protected by their\r\nclothing, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett suffered cruelly, but not\r\na complaint escaped their lips. They were determined to follow Top,\r\nwherever the intelligent animal wished to lead them.\r\n\r\nTowards five o’clock day began to break. At the zenith, where the fog\r\nwas less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an opaque belt, a\r\nluminous line clearly traced the horizon. The crests of the billows were\r\ntipped with a wild light, and the foam regained its whiteness. At the\r\nsame time on the left the hilly parts of the coast could be seen, though\r\nvery indistinctly.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock day had broken. The clouds rapidly lifted. The seaman and\r\nhis companions were then about six miles from the Chimneys. They were\r\nfollowing a very flat shore bounded by a reef of rocks, whose heads\r\nscarcely emerged from the sea, for they were in deep water. On the left,\r\nthe country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs, bristling\r\nwith thistles. There was no cliff, and the shore offered no resistance\r\nto the ocean but a chain of irregular hillocks. Here and there grew two\r\nor three trees, inclined towards the west, their branches projecting in\r\nthat direction. Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Top became very excited. He ran forward, then returned,\r\nand seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps. The dog then left the\r\nbeach, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without showing the least\r\nhesitation, went straight in among the downs. They followed him. The\r\ncountry appeared an absolute desert. Not a living creature was to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of hillocks\r\nand even of hills, very irregularly distributed. They resembled a\r\nSwitzerland modeled in sand, and only an amazing instinct could have\r\npossibly recognized the way.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his two\r\ncompanions arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the back of\r\na high mound. There Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear bark. Spilett,\r\nHerbert, and Pencroft dashed into the cave.\r\n\r\nNeb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of grass.\r\n\r\nThe body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n\r\nNeb did not move. Pencroft only uttered one word.\r\n\r\n“Living?” he cried.\r\n\r\nNeb did not reply. Spilett and the sailor turned pale. Herbert clasped\r\nhis hands, and remained motionless. The poor Negro, absorbed in his\r\ngrief, evidently had neither seen his companions nor heard the sailor\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThe reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear\r\nto the engineer’s chest, having first torn open his clothes.\r\n\r\nA minute--an age!--passed, during which he endeavored to catch the\r\nfaintest throb of the heart.\r\n\r\nNeb had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing. Despair had\r\ncompletely changed his countenance. He could scarcely be recognized,\r\nexhausted with fatigue, broken with grief. He believed his master was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive examination.\r\n\r\n“He lives!” said he.\r\n\r\nPencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a\r\nthrobbing, and even felt a slight breath on his cheek.\r\n\r\nHerbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water. He found,\r\na hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have been greatly\r\nincreased by the rains, and which filtered through the sand; but nothing\r\nin which to put the water, not even a shell among the downs. The lad was\r\nobliged to content himself with dipping his handkerchief in the stream,\r\nand with it hastened back to the grotto.\r\n\r\nHappily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who only\r\nwished to wet the engineer’s lips. The cold water produced an almost\r\nimmediate effect. His chest heaved and he seemed to try to speak.\r\n\r\n“We will save him!” exclaimed the reporter.\r\n\r\nAt these words hope revived in Neb’s heart. He undressed his master\r\nto see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to be found,\r\neither on the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising, as he must\r\nhave been dashed against the rocks; even the hands were uninjured, and\r\nit was difficult to explain how the engineer showed no traces of the\r\nefforts which he must have made to get out of reach of the breakers.\r\n\r\nBut the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to speak he\r\nwould say what had happened. For the present the question was, how to\r\nrecall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing would bring this\r\nabout; so they set to work with the sailor’s jersey.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm slightly\r\nand began to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from exhaustion,\r\nand certainly, had not the reporter and his companions arrived, it would\r\nhave been all over with Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“You thought your master was dead, didn’t you?” said the seaman to Neb.\r\n\r\n“Yes! quite dead!” replied Neb, “and if Top had not found you, and\r\nbrought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have lain\r\ndown on his grave to die!”\r\n\r\nIt had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!\r\n\r\nNeb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after having\r\nleft the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in a northerly\r\ndirection, and had reached that part of the shore which he had already\r\nvisited.\r\n\r\nThere, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the beach,\r\namong the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to guide him. He\r\nexamined particularly that part of the beach which was not covered by\r\nthe high tide, for near the sea the water would have obliterated all\r\nmarks. Neb did not expect to find his master living. It was for a corpse\r\nthat he searched, a corpse which he wished to bury with his own hands!\r\n\r\nHe sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have been\r\nvisited by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea had not\r\nreached, and which might be met with by millions above high-water mark,\r\nwere untouched. Not a shell was broken.\r\n\r\nNeb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was\r\npossible that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant point.\r\nWhen a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it rarely\r\nhappens that the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later. This Neb\r\nknew, and he wished to see his master again for the last time.\r\n\r\n“I went along the coast for another two miles, carefully examining\r\nthe beach, both at high and low water, and I had despaired of finding\r\nanything, when yesterday, above five in the evening, I saw footprints on\r\nthe sand.”\r\n\r\n“Footprints?” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” replied Neb.\r\n\r\n“Did these footprints begin at the water’s edge?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Neb, “only above high-water mark, for the others must have\r\nbeen washed out by the tide.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, Neb,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“I went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very clear\r\nand went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of a mile,\r\nrunning, but taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes after, as\r\nit was getting dark, I heard the barking of a dog. It was Top, and Top\r\nbrought me here, to my master!”\r\n\r\nNeb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the\r\ninanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life.\r\nNow that he had found him dead he longed for him to be alive. All his\r\nefforts were useless! Nothing remained to be done but to render the last\r\nduties to the one whom he had loved so much! Neb then thought of his\r\ncompanions. They, no doubt, would wish to see the unfortunate man again.\r\nTop was there. Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal?\r\nNeb several times pronounced the name of the reporter, the one among his\r\ncompanions whom Top knew best.\r\n\r\nThen he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the direction\r\nindicated to him.\r\n\r\nWe have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked upon\r\nalmost as supernatural, Top had found them.\r\n\r\nNeb’s companions had listened with great attention to this account.\r\n\r\nIt was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the efforts which\r\nhe must have made to escape from the waves by crossing the rocks, had\r\nnot received even a scratch. And what could not be explained either was\r\nhow the engineer had managed to get to this cave in the downs, more than\r\na mile from the shore.\r\n\r\n“So, Neb,” said the reporter, “it was not you who brought your master to\r\nthis place.”\r\n\r\n“No, it was not I,” replied the Negro.\r\n\r\n“It’s very clear that the captain came here by himself,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“It is clear in reality,” observed Spilett, “but it is not credible!”\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer’s\r\nown lips, and they must wait for that till speech returned. Rubbing had\r\nre-established the circulation of the blood. Cyrus Harding moved his arm\r\nagain, then his head, and a few incomprehensible words escaped him.\r\n\r\nNeb, who was bending over him, spoke, but the engineer did not appear\r\nto hear, and his eyes remained closed. Life was only exhibited in him by\r\nmovement, his senses had not as yet been restored.\r\n\r\nPencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of\r\nprocuring it, for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the burnt\r\nlinen, which would easily have ignited from the sparks produced by\r\nstriking together two flints. As to the engineer’s pockets, they were\r\nentirely empty, except that of his waistcoat, which contained his watch.\r\nIt was necessary to carry Harding to the Chimneys, and that as soon as\r\npossible. This was the opinion of all.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back\r\nto consciousness sooner than they could have expected. The water with\r\nwhich they wetted his lips revived him gradually. Pencroft also thought\r\nof mixing with the water some moisture from the titra’s flesh which\r\nhe had brought. Herbert ran to the beach and returned with two large\r\nbivalve shells. The sailor concocted something which he introduced\r\nbetween the lips of the engineer, who eagerly drinking it opened his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nNeb and the reporter were leaning over him.\r\n\r\n“My master! my master!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\nThe engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his other\r\ntwo companions, and his hand slightly pressed theirs.\r\n\r\nA few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were, even\r\nthen, troubling his brain. This time he was understood. Undoubtedly they\r\nwere the same words he had before attempted to utter.\r\n\r\n“Island or continent?” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Bother the continent,” cried Pencroft hastily; “there is time enough\r\nto see about that, captain! we don’t care for anything, provided you are\r\nliving.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer nodded faintly, and then appeared to sleep.\r\n\r\nThey respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to make\r\narrangements for transporting Harding to a more comfortable place. Neb,\r\nHerbert, and Pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards\r\na high mound crowned with a few distorted trees. On the way the sailor\r\ncould not help repeating,--\r\n\r\n“Island or continent! To think of that, when at one’s last gasp! What a\r\nman!”\r\n\r\nArrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two companions\r\nset to work, with no other tools than their hands, to despoil of its\r\nprincipal branches a rather sickly tree, a sort of marine fir; with\r\nthese branches they made a litter, on which, covered with grass and\r\nleaves, they could carry the engineer.\r\n\r\nThis occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o’clock when\r\nthey returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left.\r\n\r\nThe engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the\r\ndrowsiness, in which they had found him. The color was returning to his\r\ncheeks, which till now had been as pale as death. He raised himself a\r\nlittle, looked around him, and appeared to ask where he was.\r\n\r\n“Can you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“It’s my opinion,” said the sailor, “that Captain Harding will be\r\nable to listen to you still better, if he will have some more grouse\r\njelly,--for we have grouse, captain,” added he, presenting him with a\r\nlittle of this jelly, to which he this time added some of the flesh.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was divided\r\namong his companions, who found it but a meager breakfast, for they were\r\nsuffering extremely from hunger.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said the sailor, “there is plenty of food at the Chimneys, for\r\nyou must know, captain, that down there, in the south, we have a house,\r\nwith rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the pantry, several dozen of\r\nbirds, which our Herbert calls couroucous. Your litter is ready, and as\r\nsoon as you feel strong enough we will carry you home.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my friend,” replied the engineer; “wait another hour or two,\r\nand then we will set out. And now speak, Spilett.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter then told him all that had occurred. He recounted all the\r\nevents with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of the balloon,\r\nthe landing on this unknown land, which appeared a desert (whatever it\r\nwas, whether island or continent), the discovery of the Chimneys,\r\nthe search for him, not forgetting of course Neb’s devotion, the\r\nintelligence exhibited by the faithful Top, as well as many other\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, “you did not, then, pick\r\nme up on the beach?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\n“And did you not bring me to this cave?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“At what distance is this cave from the sea?”\r\n\r\n“About a mile,” replied Pencroft; “and if you are astonished, captain,\r\nwe are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this place!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and who took\r\ngreat interest in these details, “indeed it is very singular!”\r\n\r\n“But,” resumed the sailor, “can you tell us what happened after you were\r\ncarried off by the sea?”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding considered. He knew very little. The wave had torn him\r\nfrom the balloon net. He sank at first several fathoms. On returning\r\nto the surface, in the half light, he felt a living creature struggling\r\nnear him. It was Top, who had sprung to his help. He saw nothing of the\r\nballoon, which, lightened both of his weight and that of the dog, had\r\ndarted away like an arrow.\r\n\r\nThere he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which could\r\nnot be less than half a mile from the shore. He attempted to struggle\r\nagainst the billows by swimming vigorously. Top held him up by his\r\nclothes; but a strong current seized him and drove him towards the\r\nnorth, and after half an hour of exertion, he sank, dragging Top\r\nwith him into the depths. From that moment to the moment in which he\r\nrecovered to find himself in the arms of his friends he remembered\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“However,” remarked Pencroft, “you must have been thrown on to the\r\nbeach, and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb found your\r\nfootmarks!”\r\n\r\n“Yes... of course,” replied the engineer, thoughtfully; “and you found\r\nno traces of human beings on this coast?”\r\n\r\n“Not a trace,” replied the reporter; “besides, if by chance you had met\r\nwith some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why should he have\r\nabandoned you after having saved you from the waves?”\r\n\r\n“You are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb,” added the engineer,\r\nturning to his servant, “it was not you who... you can’t have had a\r\nmoment of unconsciousness... during which no, that’s absurd.... Do any\r\nof the footsteps still remain?” asked Harding.\r\n\r\n“Yes, master,” replied Neb; “here, at the entrance, at the back of\r\nthe mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind. The storm has\r\ndestroyed the others.”\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” said Cyrus Harding, “will you take my shoe and see if it\r\nfits exactly to the footprints?”\r\n\r\nThe sailor did as the engineer requested. While he and Herbert, guided\r\nby Neb, went to the place where the footprints were to be found, Cyrus\r\nremarked to the reporter,--\r\n\r\n“It is a most extraordinary thing!”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly inexplicable!” replied Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“But do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will talk about\r\nit by-and-by.”\r\n\r\nA moment after the others entered.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it. The engineer’s shoe fitted exactly to the\r\nfootmarks. It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them on the sand.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he, “I must have experienced this unconsciousness which I\r\nattributed to Neb. I must have walked like a somnambulist, without any\r\nknowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me here, after having\r\ndragged me from the waves... Come, Top! Come, old dog!”\r\n\r\nThe magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and caresses were\r\nlavished on him. It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting\r\nfor the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of\r\nthe affair.\r\n\r\nTowards twelve o’clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if they could\r\nnow remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an effort which\r\nexhibited the most energetic will, got up. But he was obliged to lean on\r\nthe sailor, or he would have fallen.\r\n\r\n“Well done!” cried Pencroft; “bring the captain’s litter.”\r\n\r\nThe litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with\r\nleaves and long grass. Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft, having\r\ntaken his place at one end and Neb at the other, they started towards\r\nthe coast. There was a distance of eight miles to be accomplished; but,\r\nas they could not go fast, and it would perhaps be necessary to stop\r\nfrequently, they reckoned that it would take at least six hours to reach\r\nthe Chimneys. The wind was still strong, but fortunately it did not\r\nrain. Although lying down, the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed\r\nthe coast, particularly inland. He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no\r\ndoubt, the appearance of the country, with its inequalities of ground,\r\nits forests, its various productions, were impressed on his mind.\r\nHowever, after traveling for two hours, fatigue overcame him, and he\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nAt half-past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and a short\r\ntime after at the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThey stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus Harding was\r\nsleeping profoundly, and did not awake.\r\n\r\nPencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm had\r\nquite altered the aspect of the place. Important changes had occurred;\r\ngreat blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also covered with a\r\nthick carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack. Evidently the sea, passing\r\nover the islet, had been carried right up to the foot of the enormous\r\ncurtain of granite. The soil in front of the cave had been torn away\r\nby the violence of the waves. A horrid presentiment flashed across\r\nPencroft’s mind. He rushed into the passage, but returned almost\r\nimmediately, and stood motionless, staring at his companions.... The\r\nfire was out; the drowned cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt\r\nlinen, which was to have served as tinder, had disappeared! The sea had\r\npenetrated to the end of the passages, and everything was overthrown and\r\ndestroyed in the interior of the Chimneys!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nIn a few words, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb were made acquainted\r\nwith what had happened. This accident, which appeared so very serious\r\nto Pencroft, produced different effects on the companions of the honest\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\nNeb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or\r\nrather, did not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying.\r\n\r\nHerbert shared in some degree the sailor’s feelings.\r\n\r\nAs to the reporter, he simply replied,--\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Pencroft, it’s perfectly indifferent to me!”\r\n\r\n“But, I repeat, that we haven’t any fire!”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!”\r\n\r\n“Nor any means of relighting it!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“But I say, Mr. Spilett--”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t Cyrus here?” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Is not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making fire\r\nfor us!”\r\n\r\n“With what?”\r\n\r\n“With nothing.”\r\n\r\nWhat had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the bottom of\r\nhis heart he shared the confidence which his companions had in Cyrus\r\nHarding. The engineer was to them a microcosm, a compound of every\r\nscience, a possessor of all human knowledge. It was better to be with\r\nCyrus in a desert island, than without him in the most flourishing town\r\nin the United States. With him they could want nothing; with him they\r\nwould never despair. If these brave men had been told that a volcanic\r\neruption would destroy the land, that this land would be engulfed in the\r\ndepths of the Pacific, they would have imperturbably replied,--\r\n\r\n“Cyrus is here!”\r\n\r\nWhile in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed into\r\nunconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been subjected during\r\nhis journey had brought on, so that they could not now appeal to his\r\ningenuity. The supper must necessarily be very meager. In fact, all the\r\ngrouse flesh had been consumed, and there no longer existed any means of\r\ncooking more game. Besides, the couroucous which had been reserved had\r\ndisappeared. They must consider what was to be done.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central passage. There\r\nthey managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained\r\nalmost dry. The deep sleep which had overpowered him would no doubt be\r\nmore beneficial to him than any nourishment.\r\n\r\nNight had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified when the\r\nwind shifted to the northwest, again became extremely cold. Also, the\r\nsea having destroyed the partitions which Pencroft had put up in certain\r\nplaces in the passages, the Chimneys, on account of the draughts, had\r\nbecome scarcely habitable. The engineer’s condition would, therefore,\r\nhave been bad enough, if his companions had not carefully covered him\r\nwith their coats and waistcoats.\r\n\r\nSupper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable\r\nlithodomes, of which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply on the\r\nbeach. However, to these molluscs, the lad added some edible sea-weed,\r\nwhich he gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only washed by the sea\r\nat the time of high tides. This sea-weed, which belongs to the order\r\nof Fucacae, of the genus Sargassum, produces, when dry, a gelatinous\r\nmatter, rich and nutritious. The reporter and his companions, after\r\nhaving eaten a quantity of lithodomes, sucked the sargassum, of which\r\nthe taste was very tolerable. It is used in parts of the East very\r\nconsiderably by the natives. “Never mind!” said the sailor, “the captain\r\nwill help us soon.” Meanwhile the cold became very severe, and unhappily\r\nthey had no means of defending themselves from it.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to procure fire.\r\nNeb helped him in this work. He found some dry moss, and by striking\r\ntogether two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being\r\ninflammable enough, did not take fire, for the sparks were really only\r\nincandescent, and not at all of the same consistency as those which\r\nare emitted from flint when struck in the same manner. The experiment,\r\ntherefore, did not succeed.\r\n\r\nPencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then tried\r\nrubbing two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do. Certainly, the\r\nmovement which he and Neb exhibited, if it had been transformed into\r\nheat, according to the new theory, would have been enough to heat the\r\nboiler of a steamer! It came to nothing. The bits of wood became hot, to\r\nbe sure, but much less so than the operators themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of\r\nperspiration, threw down the pieces of wood in disgust.\r\n\r\n“I can never be made to believe that savages light their fires in this\r\nway, let them say what they will,” he exclaimed. “I could sooner light\r\nmy arms by rubbing them against each other!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding. Savages often kindle\r\nwood by means of rapid rubbing. But every sort of wood does not answer\r\nfor the purpose, and besides, there is “the knack,” following the usual\r\nexpression, and it is probable that Pencroft had not “the knack.”\r\n\r\nPencroft’s ill humor did not last long. Herbert had taken the bits of\r\nwood which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to rub them.\r\nThe hardy sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the\r\nefforts of the lad to succeed where he had failed.\r\n\r\n“Rub, my boy, rub!” said he.\r\n\r\n“I am rubbing,” replied Herbert, laughing, “but I don’t pretend to do\r\nanything else but warm myself instead of shivering, and soon I shall be\r\nas hot as you are, my good Pencroft!”\r\n\r\nThis soon happened. However, they were obliged to give up, for this\r\nnight at least, the attempt to procure fire. Gideon Spilett repeated,\r\nfor the twentieth time, that Cyrus Harding would not have been troubled\r\nfor so small a difficulty. And, in the meantime, he stretched himself in\r\none of the passages on his bed of sand. Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft did\r\nthe same, while Top slept at his master’s feet.\r\n\r\nNext day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about eight in the\r\nmorning, he saw his companions around him watching his sleep, and, as on\r\nthe day before, his first words were:--\r\n\r\n“Island or continent?” This was his uppermost thought.\r\n\r\n“Well!” replied Pencroft, “we don’t know anything about it, captain!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know yet?”\r\n\r\n“But we shall know,” rejoined Pencroft, “when you have guided us into\r\nthe country.”\r\n\r\n“I think I am able to try it,” replied the engineer, who, without much\r\neffort, rose and stood upright.\r\n\r\n“That’s capital!” cried the sailor.\r\n\r\n“I feel dreadfully weak,” replied Harding. “Give me something to eat, my\r\nfriends, and it will soon go off. You have fire, haven’t you?”\r\n\r\nThis question was not immediately replied to. But, in a few seconds--\r\n\r\n“Alas! we have no fire,” said Pencroft, “or rather, captain, we have it\r\nno longer!”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor recounted all that had passed the day before. He amused\r\nthe engineer by the history of the single match, then his abortive\r\nattempt to procure fire in the savages’ way.\r\n\r\n“We shall consider,” replied the engineer, “and if we do not find some\r\nsubstance similar to tinder--”\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Well, we will make matches.\r\n\r\n“Chemicals?”\r\n\r\n“Chemicals!”\r\n\r\n“It is not more difficult than that,” cried the reporter, striking the\r\nsailor on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe latter did not think it so simple, but he did not protest. All went\r\nout. The weather had become very fine. The sun was rising from the sea’s\r\nhorizon, and touched with golden spangles the prismatic rugosities of\r\nthe huge precipice.\r\n\r\nHaving thrown a rapid glance around him, the engineer seated himself on\r\na block of stone. Herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell-fish and\r\nsargassum, saying,--\r\n\r\n“It is all that we have, Captain Harding.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my boy,” replied Harding; “it will do--for this morning at\r\nleast.”\r\n\r\nHe ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with a little\r\nfresh water, drawn from the river in an immense shell.\r\n\r\nHis companions looked at him without speaking. Then, feeling somewhat\r\nrefreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,--\r\n\r\n“So, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an\r\nisland, or on a continent?”\r\n\r\n“No, captain,” replied the boy.\r\n\r\n“We shall know to-morrow,” said the engineer; “till then, there is\r\nnothing to be done.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Fire,” said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea.\r\n\r\n“We will make it, Pencroft,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\n“While you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a\r\nmountain which commands the country?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Spilett, “a mountain which must be rather high--”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the engineer, “we will climb to the summit to-morrow,\r\nand then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent. Till\r\nthen, I repeat, there is nothing to be done.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, fire!” said the obstinate sailor again.\r\n\r\n“But he will make us a fire!” replied Gideon Spilett, “only have a\r\nlittle patience, Pencroft!”\r\n\r\nThe seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, “If it\r\ndepended upon you to do it, we wouldn’t taste roast meat very soon”; but\r\nhe was silent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply. He appeared to be very\r\nlittle troubled by the question of fire. For a few minutes he remained\r\nabsorbed in thought; then again speaking,--\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said he, “our situation is, perhaps, deplorable; but, at\r\nany rate, it is very plain. Either we are on a continent, and then, at\r\nthe expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach some inhabited\r\nplace, or we are on an island. In the latter case, if the island is\r\ninhabited, we will try to get out of the scrape with the help of its\r\ninhabitants; if it is desert, we will try to get out of the scrape by\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, nothing could be plainer,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“But, whether it is an island or a continent,” asked Gideon Spilett,\r\n“whereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say exactly,” replied the engineer, “but I presume it is\r\nsome land in the Pacific. In fact, when we left Richmond, the wind was\r\nblowing from the northeast, and its very violence greatly proves that\r\nit could not have varied. If the direction has been maintained from\r\nthe northeast to the southwest, we have traversed the States of North\r\nCarolina, of South Carolina, of Georgia, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico,\r\nitself, in its narrow part, then a part of the Pacific Ocean. I cannot\r\nestimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven\r\nthousand miles, and, even supposing that the wind had varied half a\r\nquarter, it must have brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava,\r\neither on the Pomotous, or even, if it had a greater strength than I\r\nsuppose, to the land of New Zealand. If the last hypothesis is correct,\r\nit will be easy enough to get home again. English or Maoris, we shall\r\nalways find some one to whom we can speak. If, on the contrary, this is\r\nthe coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago, perhaps we shall\r\nbe able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that peak which overlooks\r\nthe country, and then we shall see how best to establish ourselves here\r\nas if we are never to go away.”\r\n\r\n“Never?” cried the reporter. “You say ‘Never,’ my dear Cyrus?”\r\n\r\n“Better to put things at the worst at first,” replied the engineer, “and\r\nreserve the best for a surprise.”\r\n\r\n“Well said,” remarked Pencroft. “It is to be hoped, too, that this\r\nisland, if it be one, is not situated just out of the course of ships;\r\nthat would be really unlucky!”\r\n\r\n“We shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first made the\r\nascent of the mountain,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But to-morrow, captain,” asked Herbert, “shall you be in a state to\r\nbear the fatigue of the ascent?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” replied the engineer, “provided you and Pencroft, my boy,\r\nshow yourselves quick and clever hunters.”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said the sailor, “since you are speaking of game, if on my\r\nreturn, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing it back--”\r\n\r\n“Bring it back all the same, Pencroft,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\nIt was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to pass the\r\nday at the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the upper plateau.\r\nNeb, Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the forest, renew their\r\nstore of wood, and lay violent hands on every creature, feathered or\r\nhairy, which might come within their reach.\r\n\r\nThey set out accordingly about ten o’clock in the morning, Herbert\r\nconfident, Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,--\r\n\r\n“If, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe that\r\nthe thunder itself came to light it.” All three climbed the bank; and\r\narrived at the angle made by the river, the sailor, stopping, said to\r\nhis two companions,--\r\n\r\n“Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men?”\r\n\r\n“Hunters,” replied Herbert. “There is Top already in quest.”\r\n\r\n“We will hunt, then,” said the sailor, “and afterwards we can come back\r\nand collect our wood.”\r\n\r\nThis agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn three\r\nsticks from the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was bounding\r\nabout among the long grass.\r\n\r\nThis time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the river,\r\nplunged straight into the heart of the forest. There were still the\r\nsame trees, belonging, for the most part, to the pine family. In\r\ncertain places, less crowded, growing in clumps, these pines exhibited\r\nconsiderable dimensions, and appeared to indicate, by their development,\r\nthat the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had\r\nsupposed. Glades, bristling with stumps worn away by time, were covered\r\nwith dry wood, which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel. Then,\r\nthe glade passed, the underwood thickened again, and became almost\r\nimpenetrable.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of trees,\r\nwithout any beaten track. So the sailor from time to time broke off\r\nbranches which might be easily recognized. But, perhaps, he was wrong\r\nnot to follow the watercourse, as he and Herbert had done on their first\r\nexcursion, for after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself.\r\nTop, running under the branches, only roused birds which could not be\r\napproached. Even the couroucous were invisible, and it was probable that\r\nthe sailor would be obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest,\r\nin which he had so happily performed his grouse fishing.\r\n\r\n“Well, Pencroft,” said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, “if this is\r\nall the game which you promised to bring back to my master, it won’t\r\nneed a large fire to roast it!”\r\n\r\n“Have patience,” replied the sailor, “it isn’t the game which will be\r\nwanting on our return.”\r\n\r\n“Have you not confidence in Captain Harding?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But you don’t believe that he will make fire?”\r\n\r\n“I shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the fireplace.”\r\n\r\n“It will blaze, since my master has said so.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its course above\r\nthe horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued, and was usefully\r\nmarked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree whose fruit was\r\nedible. This was the stone-pine, which produces an excellent almond,\r\nvery much esteemed in the temperate regions of America and Europe. These\r\nalmonds were in a perfect state of maturity, and Herbert described them\r\nto his companions, who feasted on them.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Pencroft, “sea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels for meat,\r\nand almonds for dessert, that’s certainly a good dinner for those who\r\nhave not a single match in their pocket!”\r\n\r\n“We mustn’t complain,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I am not complaining, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “only I repeat, that\r\nmeat is a little too much economized in this sort of meal.”\r\n\r\n“Top has found something!” cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket, in the\r\nmidst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top’s barking were\r\nmingled curious gruntings.\r\n\r\nThe sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there this\r\nwas not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but rather, how\r\nthey were to get hold of it.\r\n\r\nThe hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top engaged\r\nin a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear. This\r\nquadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long, of a\r\nblackish brown color, lighter below, having hard scanty hair; its toes,\r\nthen strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be united by a membrane.\r\nHerbert recognized in this animal the capybara, that is to say, one of\r\nthe largest members of the rodent order.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It stupidly\r\nrolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat. Perhaps it saw men\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\nHowever, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just going to\r\nfell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top’s teeth, by which\r\nit was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a vigorous grunt, rushed\r\nupon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and disappeared in the wood.\r\n\r\n“The rascal!” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAll three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they joined\r\nhim the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large pond shaded\r\nby venerable pines.\r\n\r\nNeb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into the\r\nwater, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n“Let us wait,” said the boy, “for he will soon come to the surface to\r\nbreathe.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t he drown?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Herbert, “since he has webbed feet, and is almost an\r\namphibious animal. But watch him.”\r\n\r\nTop remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went to\r\ndifferent parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the\r\ncapybara, which the dog was looking for beneath the water.\r\n\r\nHerbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal appeared on the\r\nsurface of the water. Top was upon it in a bound, and kept it from\r\nplunging again. An instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was\r\nkilled by a blow from Neb’s stick.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of triumph.\r\n\r\n“Give me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the bones!”\r\n\r\nPencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by the\r\nheight of the sun that it was about two o’clock, he gave the signal to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nTop’s instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the intelligent\r\nanimal, were enabled to discover the road by which they had come. Half\r\nan hour later they arrived at the river.\r\n\r\nPencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though if\r\nthere was no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft following the\r\ncurrent, they returned towards the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nBut the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and again\r\nuttering a tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of the cliff,--\r\n\r\n“Herbert! Neb! Look!” he shouted.\r\n\r\nSmoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the three hunters were before a crackling fire. The\r\ncaptain and the reporter were there. Pencroft looked from one to the\r\nother, his capybara in his hand, without saying a word.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, my brave fellow,” cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Fire, real fire, which will roast this splendid pig perfectly, and we\r\nwill have a feast presently!”\r\n\r\n“But who lighted it?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“The sun!”\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett was quite right in his reply. It was the sun which\r\nhad furnished the heat which so astonished Pencroft. The sailor could\r\nscarcely believe his eyes, and he was so amazed that he did not think of\r\nquestioning the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Had you a burning-glass, sir?” asked Herbert of Harding.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy,” replied he, “but I made one.”\r\n\r\nAnd he showed the apparatus which served for a burning-glass. It was\r\nsimply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter’s\r\nwatches. Having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive\r\nby means of a little clay, he thus fabricated a regular burning-glass,\r\nwhich, concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss, soon caused\r\nit to blaze.\r\n\r\nThe sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the engineer\r\nwithout saying a word, only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if\r\nCyrus Harding was not a magician, he was certainly no ordinary man. At\r\nlast speech returned to him, and he cried,--\r\n\r\n“Note that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!”\r\n\r\n“It is noted,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\nThen, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the capybara,\r\nproperly cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling-pig before a clear,\r\ncrackling fire.\r\n\r\nThe Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because the\r\npassages were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of wood and\r\nmud had been re-established.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their\r\nday well. Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his strength, and\r\nhad proved it by climbing to the upper plateau. From this point his eye,\r\naccustomed to estimate heights and distances, was fixed for a long time\r\non the cone, the summit of which he wished to reach the next day. The\r\nmountain, situated about six miles to the northwest, appeared to him to\r\nmeasure 3,500 feet above the level of the sea. Consequently the gaze of\r\nan observer posted on its summit would extend over a radius of at least\r\nfifty miles. Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve\r\nthe question of “island or continent,” to which he attached so much\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThey supped capitally. The flesh of the capybara was declared excellent.\r\nThe sargassum and the almonds of the stone-pine completed the repast,\r\nduring which the engineer spoke little. He was preoccupied with projects\r\nfor the next day.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would be best\r\nto do; but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical mind, only\r\nshook his head without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” he repeated, “we shall know what we have to depend upon,\r\nand we will act accordingly.”\r\n\r\nThe meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and\r\nthe inhabitants of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, were soon\r\nburied in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nNo incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the 29th\r\nof March, fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the excursion\r\nwhich must determine their fate.\r\n\r\nAll was ready for the start. The remains of the capybara would be enough\r\nto sustain Harding and his companions for at least twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nBesides, they hoped to find more food on the way. As the glasses had\r\nbeen returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter, Pencroft\r\nburned a little linen to serve as tinder. As to flint, that would not be\r\nwanting in these regions of Plutonic origin. It was half-past seven in\r\nthe morning when the explorers, armed with sticks, left the Chimneys.\r\nFollowing Pencroft’s advice, it appeared best to take the road already\r\ntraversed through the forest, and to return by another route. It was\r\nalso the most direct way to reach the mountain. They turned the south\r\nangle and followed the left bank of the river, which was abandoned at\r\nthe point where it formed an elbow towards the southwest. The path,\r\nalready trodden under the evergreen trees, was found, and at nine\r\no’clock Cyrus Harding and his companions had reached the western border\r\nof the forest. The ground, till then, very little undulated, boggy at\r\nfirst, dry and sandy afterwards, had a gentle slope, which ascended from\r\nthe shore towards the interior of the country. A few very timid animals\r\nwere seen under the forest-trees. Top quickly started them, but his\r\nmaster soon called him back, for the time had not come to commence\r\nhunting; that would be attended to later. The engineer was not a man who\r\nwould allow himself to be diverted from his fixed idea. It might even\r\nhave been said that he did not observe the country at all, either in\r\nits configuration or in its natural productions, his great aim being\r\nto climb the mountain before him, and therefore straight towards it he\r\nwent. At ten o’clock a halt of a few minutes was made. On leaving\r\nthe forest, the mountain system of the country appeared before the\r\nexplorers. The mountain was composed of two cones; the first, truncated\r\nat a height of about two thousand five hundred feet, was sustained by\r\nbuttresses, which appeared to branch out like the talons of an immense\r\nclaw set on the ground. Between these were narrow valleys, bristling\r\nwith trees, the last clumps of which rose to the top of the lowest cone.\r\nThere appeared to be less vegetation on that side of the mountain which\r\nwas exposed to the northeast, and deep fissures could be seen which, no\r\ndoubt, were watercourses.\r\n\r\nOn the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed a little\r\non one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear. A Scotchman\r\nwould have said, “His bonnet was a thocht ajee.” It appeared formed of\r\nbare earth, here and there pierced by reddish rocks.\r\n\r\nThey wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the ridge of\r\nthe spurs seemed to be the best way by which to gain it.\r\n\r\n“We are on volcanic ground,” Cyrus Harding had said, and his companions\r\nfollowing him began to ascend by degrees on the back of a spur, which,\r\nby a winding and consequently more accessible path, joined the first\r\nplateau.\r\n\r\nThe ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force. Here and\r\nthere stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and pumice-stone, were met\r\nwith. In isolated groups rose fir-trees, which, some hundred feet\r\nlower, at the bottom of the narrow gorges, formed massive shades almost\r\nimpenetrable to the sun’s rays.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the footprints\r\nwhich indicated the recent passage of large animals.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in\r\nIndia, and the lion in Africa, “we shall soon learn how successfully to\r\nencounter them. But in the meantime we must be upon our guard!”\r\n\r\nThey ascended but slowly.\r\n\r\nThe distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not be\r\nsurmounted directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground suddenly fell,\r\nand they found themselves on the edge of a deep chasm which they had to\r\ngo round. Thus, in retracing their steps so as to find some practicable\r\npath, much time was employed and fatigue undergone for nothing. At\r\ntwelve o’clock, when the small band of adventurers halted for breakfast\r\nat the foot of a large group of firs, near a little stream which fell in\r\ncascades, they found themselves still half way from the first plateau,\r\nwhich most probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this\r\npoint the view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high\r\npromontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it. On\r\nthe left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on the\r\nnorthwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut short\r\nby the ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a powerful\r\nsupport of the central cone.\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more towards the\r\nsouthwest and again entered among thick bushes. There under the shade\r\nof the trees fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the\r\npheasant species. They were tragopans, ornamented by a pendant skin\r\nwhich hangs over their throats, and by two small, round horns, planted\r\nbehind the eyes. Among these birds, which were about the size of a fowl,\r\nthe female was uniformly brown, while the male was gorgeous in his\r\nred plumage, decorated with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone\r\ncleverly and vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which\r\nPencroft, made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by resting on\r\neach other’s shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep\r\nacclivity and reached a level place, with very few trees, where the soil\r\nappeared volcanic. It was necessary to ascend by zigzags to make\r\nthe slope more easy, for it was very steep, and the footing being\r\nexceedingly precarious required the greatest caution. Neb and Herbert\r\ntook the lead, Pencroft the rear, the captain and the reporter between\r\nthem. The animals which frequented these heights--and there were\r\nnumerous traces of them--must necessarily belong to those races of sure\r\nfoot and supple spine, chamois or goat. Several were seen, but this\r\nwas not the name Pencroft gave them, for all of a sudden--“Sheep!” he\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\nAll stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a large size,\r\nwith strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point, with a\r\nwoolly fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color.\r\n\r\nThey were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the\r\nmountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave the\r\nname of the musmon.\r\n\r\n“Have they legs and chops?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, they are sheep!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\nThe animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with an\r\nastonished eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time. Then\r\ntheir fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over the rocks.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, till we meet again,” cried Pencroft, as he watched them, in\r\nsuch a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb\r\ncould not help laughing.\r\n\r\nThe ascent was continued. Here and there were traces of lava. Sulphur\r\nsprings sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go round them. In\r\nsome places the sulphur had formed crystals among other substances, such\r\nas whitish cinders made of an infinity of little feldspar crystals.\r\n\r\nIn approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the lower\r\ncone, the difficulties of the ascent were very great. Towards four\r\no’clock the extreme zone of the trees had been passed. There only\r\nremained here and there a few twisted, stunted pines, which must have\r\nhad a hard life in resisting at this altitude the high winds from the\r\nopen sea. Happily for the engineer and his companions the weather was\r\nbeautiful, the atmosphere tranquil; for a high breeze at an elevation of\r\nthree thousand feet would have hindered their proceedings. The purity\r\nof the sky at the zenith was felt through the transparent air. A perfect\r\ncalm reigned around them. They could not see the sun, then hid by the\r\nvast screen of the upper cone, which masked the half-horizon of the\r\nwest, and whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as\r\nthe radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course. Vapor--mist rather than\r\nclouds--began to appear in the east, and assume all the prismatic colors\r\nunder the influence of the solar rays.\r\n\r\nFive hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau, which\r\nthey wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the\r\nnight, but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles\r\nby the zigzags which they had to describe. The soil, as it were, slid\r\nunder their feet.\r\n\r\nThe slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the\r\nstones worn by the air did not give a sufficient support. Evening\r\ncame on by degrees, and it was almost night when Cyrus Harding and his\r\ncompanions, much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours, arrived at\r\nthe plateau of the first cone. It was then necessary to prepare an\r\nencampment, and to restore their strength by eating first and sleeping\r\nafterwards. This second stage of the mountain rose on a base of rocks,\r\namong which it would be easy to find a retreat. Fuel was not abundant.\r\nHowever, a fire could be made by means of the moss and dry brushwood,\r\nwhich covered certain parts of the plateau. While the sailor was\r\npreparing his hearth with stones which he put to this use, Neb and\r\nHerbert occupied themselves with getting a supply of fuel. They soon\r\nreturned with a load of brushwood. The steel was struck, the burnt linen\r\ncaught the sparks of flint, and, under Neb’s breath, a crackling fire\r\nshowed itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks. Their\r\nobject in lighting a fire was only to enable them to withstand the cold\r\ntemperature of the night, as it was not employed in cooking the bird,\r\nwhich Neb kept for the next day. The remains of the capybara and\r\nsome dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their supper. It was not\r\nhalf-past six when all was finished.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large\r\ncircular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain. Before\r\ntaking any rest, he wished to know if it was possible to get round the\r\nbase of the cone in the case of its sides being too steep and its summit\r\nbeing inaccessible. This question preoccupied him, for it was possible\r\nthat from the way the hat inclined, that is to say, towards the north,\r\nthe plateau was not practicable. Also, if the summit of the mountain\r\ncould not be reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could not\r\nget round the base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the\r\nwestern part of the country, and their object in making the ascent would\r\nin part be altogether unattained.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving Pencroft and\r\nNeb to arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note the incidents of the\r\nday, began to follow the edge of the plateau, going towards the north.\r\nHerbert accompanied him.\r\n\r\nThe night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet deep. Cyrus\r\nHarding and the boy walked near each other, without speaking. In\r\nsome places the plateau opened before them, and they passed without\r\nhindrance. In others, obstructed by rocks, there was only a narrow path,\r\nin which two persons could not walk abreast. After a walk of twenty\r\nminutes, Cyrus Harding and Herbert were obliged to stop. From this point\r\nthe slope of the two cones became one. No shoulder here separated the\r\ntwo parts of the mountain. The slope, being inclined almost seventy\r\ndegrees, the path became impracticable.\r\n\r\nBut if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts of\r\nfollowing a circular direction, in return an opportunity was given for\r\nascending the cone.\r\n\r\nIn fact, before them opened a deep hollow. It was the rugged mouth\r\nof the crater, by which the eruptive liquid matter had escaped at\r\nthe periods when the volcano was still in activity. Hardened lava and\r\ncrusted scoria formed a sort of natural staircase of large steps, which\r\nwould greatly facilitate the ascent to the summit of the mountain.\r\n\r\nHarding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating, followed\r\nby the lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nThere was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome. Would the\r\ninterior acclivities of the crater be practicable? It would soon be\r\nseen. The persevering engineer resolved to continue his ascent until\r\nhe was stopped. Happily these acclivities wound up the interior of the\r\nvolcano and favored their ascent.\r\n\r\nAs to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was completely\r\nextinct. No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame could be seen in\r\nthe dark hollows; not a roar, not a mutter, no trembling even issued\r\nfrom this black well, which perhaps reached far into the bowels of the\r\nearth. The atmosphere inside the crater was filled with no sulphurous\r\nvapor. It was more than the sleep of a volcano; it was its complete\r\nextinction. Cyrus Harding’s attempt would succeed.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior,\r\nsaw the crater widen above their heads. The radius of this circular\r\nportion of the sky, framed by the edge of the cone, increased obviously.\r\nAt each step, as it were, that the explorers made, fresh stars entered\r\nthe field of their vision. The magnificent constellations of the\r\nsouthern sky shone resplendently. At the zenith glittered the splendid\r\nAntares in the Scorpion, and not far was Alpha Centauri, which is\r\nbelieved to be the nearest star to the terrestrial globe. Then, as the\r\ncrater widened, appeared Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle,\r\nand lastly, nearly at the Antarctic Pole, the glittering Southern Cross,\r\nwhich replaces the Polar Star of the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eight o’clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set foot on\r\nthe highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the cone.\r\n\r\nIt was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over a\r\nradius of two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it\r\nconnected in the west with some continent of the Pacific? It could not\r\nyet be made out. Towards the west, a cloudy belt, clearly visible at the\r\nhorizon, increased the gloom, and the eye could not discover if the sky\r\nand water were blended together in the same circular line.\r\n\r\nBut at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared, which\r\ndescended slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the zenith.\r\n\r\nIt was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing; but its\r\nlight was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line, then detached\r\nfrom the cloud, and the engineer could see its reflection trembling for\r\nan instant on a liquid surface. Cyrus Harding seized the lad’s hand, and\r\nin a grave voice,--\r\n\r\n“An island!” said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent disappeared\r\nbeneath the waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the\r\nencampment. The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon\r\nwhich fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next day they\r\nwould consult. Then each settled himself as well as he could to sleep,\r\nand in that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand five hundred feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, through a peaceful night, the islanders\r\nenjoyed profound repose.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which\r\nconsisted solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb\r\nagain to the summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to survey\r\nthe island upon which he and his companions were imprisoned for life\r\nperhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance from any\r\nland, or if it was out of the course of vessels which visited the\r\narchipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean. This time his companions followed\r\nhim in the new exploration. They also wished to see the island, on the\r\nproductions of which they must depend for the supply of all their wants.\r\n\r\nIt was about seven o’clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert,\r\nPencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment. No one\r\nappeared to be anxious about their situation. They had faith in\r\nthemselves, doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of this\r\nfaith was not the same with Harding as with his companions. The engineer\r\nhad confidence, because he felt capable of extorting from this wild\r\ncountry everything necessary for the life of himself and his companions;\r\nthe latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them.\r\nPencroft especially, since the incident of the relighted fire, would\r\nnot have despaired for an instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the\r\nengineer was with him on the rock.\r\n\r\n“Pshaw,” said he, “we left Richmond without permission from the\r\nauthorities! It will be hard if we don’t manage to get away some day or\r\nother from a place where certainly no one will detain us!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They went\r\nround the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the mouth of\r\nthe enormous chasm. The weather was magnificent. The sun rose in a pure\r\nsky and flooded with his rays all the eastern side of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made it out to\r\nbe in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening,\r\nto a height of a thousand feet above the plateau. Below the chasm, large\r\nthick streaks of lava wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus\r\nmarked the course of the eruptive matter to the lower valleys which\r\nfurrowed the northern part of the island.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five\r\nto forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent.\r\nTraces of very ancient lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed\r\nthe summit of the cone, before this lateral chasm had opened a new way\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nAs to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the\r\nsubterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated\r\nwith the eye, for it was lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt as to\r\nthe complete extinction of the volcano.\r\n\r\nBefore eight o’clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the\r\nsummit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n“The sea, the sea everywhere!” they cried, as if their lips could not\r\nrestrain the words which made islanders of them.\r\n\r\nThe sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around\r\nthem! Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus\r\nHarding had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island shore,\r\nwhich he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before.\r\nBut nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that is to\r\nsay over a radius of more than fifty miles. No land in sight. Not a\r\nsail. Over all this immense space the ocean alone was visible--the\r\nisland occupied the center of a circumference which appeared to be\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for\r\nsome minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme\r\nlimits. Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw\r\nnothing; and certainly if there had been land at the horizon, if it\r\nappeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor would undoubtedly\r\nhave found it out, for nature had placed regular telescopes under his\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\nFrom the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded\r\nentirely, and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n“About what size is this island?”\r\n\r\nTruly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the\r\nperimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which\r\nhe was placed; then,--\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said he, “I do not think I am mistaken in giving to the\r\nshore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles.”\r\n\r\n“And consequently an area?”\r\n\r\n“That is difficult to estimate,” replied the engineer, “for it is so\r\nuneven.”\r\n\r\nIf Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had\r\nalmost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at\r\nthe same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories,\r\npoints, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the eye, and when\r\nGideon Spilett, on the engineer’s advice, had drawn the outline, they\r\nfound that it resembled some fantastic animal, a monstrous leviathan,\r\nwhich lay sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThis was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of\r\nconsequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately\r\ndrawn by the reporter.\r\n\r\nThe east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a\r\nwide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high\r\npoint from Pencroft on his first exploration. At the northeast two other\r\ncapes closed the bay, and between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked\r\nlike the half-open jaws of a formidable dog-fish.\r\n\r\nFrom the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like\r\nthe flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of\r\nprotuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part of the\r\nisland, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken\r\nat two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in\r\na long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.\r\n\r\nThis tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty\r\nmiles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island,\r\nalready mentioned; it curled round, making an open roadstead, which\r\nmarked out the lower shore of this strangely-formed land.\r\n\r\nAt the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek\r\non the western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island\r\nonly measured ten miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the\r\nnortheast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest, was not less\r\nthan thirty miles.\r\n\r\nAs to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very\r\nwoody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and\r\narid and sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano and the east\r\ncoast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised to see a\r\nlake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which they had not\r\nsuspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to be on the same\r\nlevel as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer explained to his\r\ncompanions that the altitude of this little sheet of water must be about\r\nthree hundred feet, because the plateau, which was its basin, was but a\r\nprolongation of the coast.\r\n\r\n“Is it a freshwater lake?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied the engineer, “for it must be fed by the water\r\nwhich flows from the mountain.”\r\n\r\n“I see a little river which runs into it,” said Herbert, pointing out a\r\nnarrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Harding; “and since this stream feeds the lake, most\r\nprobably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the\r\nsurplus water escapes. We shall see that on our return.”\r\n\r\nThis little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned\r\nconstituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to the\r\neyes of the explorers. However, it was possible that under the masses of\r\ntrees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an immense forest,\r\nother rivers ran towards the sea. It might even be inferred that such\r\nwas the case, so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent\r\nspecimens of the flora of the temperate zones. There was no indication\r\nof running water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant\r\nwater among the marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition\r\nto the downs, sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the\r\nluxuriant vegetation of the rest of the island.\r\n\r\nThe volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary,\r\nin the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two\r\nzones. At the southwest, at the south, and the southeast, the first part\r\nof the spurs were hidden under masses of verdure. At the north, on the\r\ncontrary, one could follow their ramifications, which died away on the\r\nsandy plains. It was on this side that, at the time when the mountain\r\nwas in a state of eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and\r\na large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the\r\nnortheastern gulf.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the\r\nmountain. The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in\r\nrelief with different tints, green for the forests, yellow for the\r\nsand, blue for the water. They viewed it in its tout-ensemble, nothing\r\nremained concealed but the ground hidden by verdure, the hollows of the\r\nvalleys, and the interior of the volcanic chasms.\r\n\r\nOne important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have\r\na great effect upon the future of the castaways.\r\n\r\nWas the island inhabited?\r\n\r\nIt was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close\r\nexamination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative.\r\n\r\nNowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group of\r\nhuts, not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke curling\r\nin the air betrayed the presence of man. It is true, a distance of\r\nnearly thirty miles separated the observers from the extreme points,\r\nthat is, of the tail which extended to the southwest, and it would have\r\nbeen difficult, even to Pencroft’s eyes, to discover a habitation there.\r\nNeither could the curtain of verdure, which covered three-quarters\r\nof the island, be raised to see if it did not shelter some straggling\r\nvillage. But in general the islanders live on the shores of the narrow\r\nspaces which emerge above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore\r\nappeared to be an absolute desert.\r\n\r\nUntil a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island\r\nwas uninhabited. But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by\r\nthe natives of neighboring islands? It was difficult to reply to this\r\nquestion. No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles. But fifty\r\nmiles could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by the large\r\nPolynesian canoes. Everything depended on the position of the island,\r\nof its isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes.\r\nWould Cyrus Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude\r\nwithout instruments? It would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it\r\nwas best to take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its\r\nfeatures made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems\r\nascertained. The disposition of the forests and plains had been marked\r\nin a general way on the reporter’s plan. They had now only to descend\r\nthe mountain slopes again, and explore the soil, in the triple point of\r\nview, of its mineral, vegetable, and animal resources.\r\n\r\nBut before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding\r\nsaid to them in a calm, grave voice,--\r\n\r\n“Here, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of\r\nthe Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a long time,\r\nperhaps. Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes\r\nby chance. I say by chance, because this is an unimportant island; there\r\nis not even a port in which ships could anchor, and it is to be feared\r\nthat it is situated out of the route usually followed, that is to say,\r\ntoo much to the south for the ships which frequent the archipelagoes of\r\nthe Pacific, and too much to the north for those which go to Australia\r\nby doubling Cape Horn. I wish to hide nothing of our position from\r\nyou--”\r\n\r\n“And you are right, my dear Cyrus,” replied the reporter, with\r\nanimation. “You have to deal with men. They have confidence in you, and\r\nyou can depend upon them. Is it not so, my friends?”\r\n\r\n“I will obey you in everything, captain,” said Herbert, seizing the\r\nengineer’s hand.\r\n\r\n“My master always, and everywhere!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“As for me,” said the sailor, “if I ever grumble at work, my name’s not\r\nJack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little America\r\nof this island! We will build towns, we will establish railways, start\r\ntelegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in\r\norder and quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of\r\nthe Union. Only, I ask one thing.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“It is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists,\r\nwho have come here to settle.” Harding could not help smiling, and the\r\nsailor’s idea was adopted. He then thanked his companions, and added,\r\nthat he would rely on their energy and on the aid of Heaven.\r\n\r\n“Well, now let us set off to the Chimneys!” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“One minute, my friends,” said the engineer. “It seems to me it would\r\nbe a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes,\r\npromontories, and watercourses, which we can see.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said the reporter. “In the future, that will simplify the\r\ninstructions which we shall have to give and follow.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said the sailor, “already it is something to be able to say\r\nwhere one is going, and where one has come from. At least, it looks like\r\nsomewhere.”\r\n\r\n“The Chimneys, for example,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Exactly!” replied Pencroft. “That name was the most convenient, and it\r\ncame to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for\r\nour first encampment, captain?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it.”\r\n\r\n“Good! as for the others, that will be easy,” returned the sailor, who\r\nwas in high spirits. “Let us give them names, as the Robinsons did,\r\nwhose story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point,\r\nCape Disappointment!”\r\n\r\n“Or, rather, the names of Captain Harding,” said Herbert, “of Mr.\r\nSpilett, of Neb!--”\r\n\r\n“My name!” cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” replied Pencroft. “Port Neb, that would do very well! And\r\nCape Gideon--”\r\n\r\n“I should prefer borrowing names from our country,” said the reporter,\r\n“which would remind us of America.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for the principal ones,” then said Cyrus Harding; “for those of\r\nthe bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to that vast bay\r\non the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on\r\nthe south, Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing,\r\nthat of Mount Franklin; to that lake which is extended under our eyes,\r\nthat of Lake Grant; nothing could be better, my friends. These names\r\nwill recall our country, and those of the great citizens who have\r\nhonored it; but for the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we\r\nperceive from the top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which\r\nwill recall their particular shape. They will impress themselves better\r\non our memory, and at the same time will be more practical. The shape of\r\nthe island is so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine\r\nwhat it resembles. As to the streams which we do not know as yet, in\r\ndifferent parts of the forest which we shall explore later, the creeks\r\nwhich afterwards will be discovered, we can christen them as we find\r\nthem. What do you think, my friends?”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions. The\r\nisland was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to\r\ngive names to all its angles and points. Gideon Spilett would write\r\nthem down, and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be\r\ndefinitely adopted. First, they named the two bays and the mountain,\r\nUnion Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the engineer had\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the reporter, “to this peninsula at the southwest of the\r\nisland, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of\r\nReptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a\r\nreptile’s tail.”\r\n\r\n“Adopted,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island, “let\r\nus call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark\r\nGulf.”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” cried Pencroft, “and we can complete the resemblance by\r\nnaming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape.”\r\n\r\n“But there are two capes,” observed the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Pencroft, “we can have North Mandible Cape and South\r\nMandible Cape.”\r\n\r\n“They are inscribed,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to\r\nbe named,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“That is, the extremity of Union Bay?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Claw Cape,” cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to some\r\npart of his domain.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like\r\nthe powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly-shaped\r\nisland represented.\r\n\r\nPencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their\r\nimaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers with\r\ndrinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the name of\r\nthe Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet upon which the\r\ncastaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island; to the plateau\r\nwhich crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and from\r\nwhence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of\r\nProspect Heights.\r\n\r\nLastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine\r\nPeninsula were named the forests of the Far West.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was\r\nthus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made fresh\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nAs to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by\r\nthe height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect\r\nHeights to the east. But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the\r\nrising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this\r\nrising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly,\r\nfor, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the\r\nsun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and\r\nnot in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those\r\nplaces situated in the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nEverything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount\r\nFranklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,--\r\n\r\n“Well! we are preciously stupid!”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen to\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\n“Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!”\r\n\r\nHerbert was going to propose to give it the engineer’s name and all his\r\ncompanions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,--\r\n\r\n“Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now\r\nstruggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let us call it\r\nLincoln Island!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.\r\n\r\nAnd that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their\r\nabsent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with\r\nblood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be subdued, and\r\nthat the cause of the North, the cause of justice, would triumph, thanks\r\nto Grant, thanks to Lincoln!\r\n\r\nNow this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that sixteen\r\ndays afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and\r\nthat on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nThey now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the crater,\r\nthey went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous\r\nnight. Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and the watches of\r\nthe reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour.\r\n\r\nThat of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as he had\r\nbeen thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves. It was an\r\ninstrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the\r\nreporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day.\r\n\r\nAs to the engineer’s watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time\r\nwhich he had passed on the downs.\r\n\r\nThe engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun\r\nthat it must be about nine o’clock in the morning, he put his watch at\r\nthat hour.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time, have you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cyrus.”\r\n\r\n“Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is\r\nalmost that of Washington?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up very,\r\nexactly, but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to us.\r\n\r\n“What will be the good of that?” thought the sailor.\r\n\r\nThey ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was\r\ntotally exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply\r\nthemselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very much to his taste,\r\nwould know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood. Moreover,\r\nthe sailor thought of simply asking the engineer to manufacture some\r\npowder and one or two fowling-pieces; he supposed there would be no\r\ndifficulty in that.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return\r\nto the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so\r\nmagnificently framed in trees. They therefore followed the crest of one\r\nof the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably\r\nhad its source. In talking, the settlers already employed the names\r\nwhich they had just chosen, which singularly facilitated the exchange\r\nof their ideas. Herbert and Pencroft--the one young and the other very\r\nboyish--were enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,\r\n\r\n“Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to lose\r\nourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or\r\nwhether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be\r\ncertain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!”\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers\r\nshould not stray away from each other. It was very certain that the\r\nthick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it\r\nwas prudent to be on their guard. In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb\r\nwalked first, preceded by Top, who poked his nose into every bush. The\r\nreporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett ready to note\r\nevery incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping\r\naside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance,\r\nwhich he put into his pocket, without making any remark.\r\n\r\n“What can he be picking up?” muttered Pencroft. “I have looked in vain\r\nfor anything that’s worth the trouble of stooping for.”\r\n\r\nTowards ten o’clock the little band descended the last declivities of\r\nMount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and\r\ntrees. They were walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a\r\nplain of nearly a mile long, which extended to the edge of the wood.\r\nGreat blocks of that basalt, which, according to Bischof, takes three\r\nhundred and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the plain, very\r\nconfused in some places. However, there were here no traces of lava,\r\nwhich was spread more particularly over the northern slopes.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the\r\ncreek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the\r\nplain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb and the\r\nsailor were hiding behind the rocks.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, my boy?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Smoke,” replied Herbert. “We have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred\r\npaces from us.”\r\n\r\n“Men in this place?” cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n“We must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to\r\ndeal,” replied Cyrus Harding. “I trust that there are no natives on this\r\nisland; I dread them more than anything else. Where is Top?”\r\n\r\n“Top is on before.”\r\n\r\n“And he doesn’t bark?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“That is strange. However, we must try to call him back.”\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined\r\ntheir two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the\r\nheaps of basalt.\r\n\r\nFrom thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nTop was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter,\r\nsigning to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the\r\nrocks. The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the result of this\r\nexploration, when a shout from the engineer made them hasten forward.\r\nThey soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable odor\r\nwhich impregnated the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what\r\nthe smoke was which at first, not without cause, had startled him.\r\n\r\n“This fire,” said he, “or rather, this smoke is produced by nature alone.\r\nThere is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats.”\r\n\r\n“Captain!” cried Pencroft. “What a pity that I haven’t got a cold!”\r\n\r\nThe settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the\r\nsmoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly\r\nbetween the rocks, and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid\r\nodor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the air.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch.\r\nHe tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its temperature, that he\r\nestimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. Herbert having asked on\r\nwhat he based this calculation,--\r\n\r\n“Its quite simple, my boy,” said he, “for, in plunging my hand into the\r\nwater, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold. Therefore it has the\r\nsame temperature as the human body, which is about ninety-five degrees.”\r\n\r\nThe sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they\r\nproceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began some\r\nhundred paces off.\r\n\r\nThere, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear\r\nand limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed\r\nthe presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the name of Red Creek\r\nwas immediately given to the watercourse.\r\n\r\nIt was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain\r\nwater, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over\r\nthe sand, there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade,\r\nran towards the lake, over a distance of a mile and a half, its breadth\r\nvarying from thirty to forty feet. Its waters were sweet, and it was\r\nsupposed that those of the lake were so also. A fortunate circumstance,\r\nin the event of their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling\r\nthan the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nAs to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of\r\nthe creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound\r\nin the temperate zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those\r\nconiferae observed in that portion of the island already explored\r\nto some miles from Prospect Heights. At this time of the year, the\r\ncommencement of the month of April, which represents the month of\r\nOctober, in this hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they\r\nwere still in full leaf. They consisted principally of casuarinas and\r\neucalypti, some of which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to\r\nthe manna of the East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping\r\nbanks, which were also covered with the high grass called “tussac” in\r\nNew Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the\r\nPacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude, doubtless,\r\nbeing too low.\r\n\r\n“What a pity!” said Herbert, “such a useful tree, and which has such\r\nbeautiful nuts!”\r\n\r\nAs to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti\r\nand casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings.\r\nBlack, white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors,\r\nkingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red, blue lories,\r\nand various other birds appeared on all sides, as through a prism,\r\nfluttering about and producing a deafening clamor. Suddenly, a strange\r\nconcert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket. The\r\nsettlers heard successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds,\r\nand a sort of clacking which they might have believed to have escaped\r\nfrom the lips of a native. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush,\r\nforgetting even the most elementary principles of prudence. Happily,\r\nthey found there, neither a formidable wild beast nor a dangerous\r\nnative, but merely half a dozen mocking and singing birds, known as\r\nmountain pheasants. A few skillful blows from a stick soon put an end to\r\ntheir concert, and procured excellent food for the evening’s dinner.\r\n\r\nHerbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings,\r\nsome superbly crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at\r\nPort-Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and\r\nmagpies which flew away in flocks.\r\n\r\nA charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these\r\nbirds, but the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and\r\nthese primitive weapons proved very insufficient.\r\n\r\nTheir insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of\r\nquadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular\r\nflying mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a\r\nheight, that one would have thought that they passed from one tree to\r\nanother like squirrels.\r\n\r\n“Kangaroos!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Stewed,” replied the reporter, “their flesh is equal to the best\r\nvenison!--”\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor,\r\nfollowed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks. Cyrus\r\nHarding called them back in vain. But it was in vain too for the hunters\r\nto pursue such agile game, which went bounding away like balls. After a\r\nchase of five minutes, they lost their breath, and at the same time all\r\nsight of the creatures, which disappeared in the wood. Top was not more\r\nsuccessful than his masters.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had\r\nrejoined them, “Captain, you see quite well we can’t get on unless we\r\nmake a few guns. Will that be possible?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” replied the engineer, “but we will begin by first\r\nmanufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don’t doubt that you will\r\nbecome as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters.”\r\n\r\n“Bows and arrows!” said Pencroft scornfully. “That’s all very well for\r\nchildren!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be proud, friend Pencroft,” replied the reporter. “Bows and\r\narrows were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with blood.\r\nPowder is but a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the human\r\nrace--unhappily.”\r\n\r\n“Faith, that’s true, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “and I always\r\nspeak too quickly. You must excuse me!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural History,\r\nreverted to the kangaroos, saying,--\r\n\r\n“Besides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most\r\ndifficult to catch. They were giants with long gray fur; but if I am not\r\nmistaken, there exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos, and rat\r\nkangaroos, which are more easy to get hold of. It is reckoned that there\r\nare about a dozen species.”\r\n\r\n“Herbert,” replied the sailor sententiously, “there is only one species\r\nof kangaroos to me, that is ‘kangaroo on the spit,’ and it’s just the\r\none we haven’t got this evening!”\r\n\r\nThey could not help laughing at Master Pencroft’s new classification.\r\nThe honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to\r\nthe singing pheasants, but fortune once more showed itself obliging to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and ferreted\r\neverywhere with an instinct doubled by a ferocious appetite. It was even\r\nprobable that if some piece of game did fall into his clutches, none\r\nwould be left for the hunters, if Top was hunting on his own account;\r\nbut Neb watched him and he did well.\r\n\r\nTowards three o’clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and gruntings\r\nshowed that he was engaged in a struggle with some animal. Neb rushed\r\nafter him, and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a quadruped, which ten\r\nseconds later would have been past recognizing in Top’s stomach. But\r\nfortunately the dog had fallen upon a brood, and besides the victim he\r\nwas devouring, two other rodents--the animals in question belonged to\r\nthat order--lay strangled on the turf.\r\n\r\nNeb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand.\r\nTheir size exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow, mingled\r\nwith green spots, and they had the merest rudiments of tails.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of these\r\nrodents. They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger than their\r\ncongeners of tropical countries, regular American rabbits, with long\r\nears, jaws armed on each side with five molars, which distinguish the\r\nagouti.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft, “the roast has arrived! and now we can go\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nThe walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed. The limpid waters of\r\nthe Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuarinas, banksias, and gigantic\r\ngum-trees. Superb lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet. Other\r\narborescent species, unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the\r\nstream, which could be heard murmuring beneath the bowers of verdure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed that\r\nthey would soon reach its mouth. In fact, on emerging from beneath a\r\nthick clump of beautiful trees, it suddenly appeared before their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant. The place\r\nwas well worth looking at. This extent of water, of a circumference of\r\nnearly seven miles and an area of two hundred and fifty acres, reposed\r\nin a border of diversified trees. Towards the east, through a curtain\r\nof verdure, picturesquely raised in some places, sparkled an horizon of\r\nsea. The lake was curved at the north, which contrasted with the sharp\r\noutline of its lower part. Numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores\r\nof this little Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American\r\nnamesake were represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some\r\nhundred feet from the southern shore. There lived in harmony several\r\ncouples of kingfishers perched on a stone, grave, motionless, watching\r\nfor fish, then darting down, they plunged in with a sharp cry, and\r\nreappeared with their prey in their beaks. On the shores and on the\r\nislets, strutted wild ducks, pelicans, water-hens, red-beaks, philedons,\r\nfurnished with a tongue like a brush, and one or two specimens of the\r\nsplendid menura, the tail of which expands gracefully like a lyre.\r\n\r\nAs to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark, and from\r\ncertain bubblings, and the concentric circles which crossed each other\r\non the surface, it could not be doubted that it abounded in fish.\r\n\r\n“This lake is really beautiful!” said Gideon Spilett. “We could live on\r\nits borders!”\r\n\r\n“We will live there!” replied Harding.\r\n\r\nThe settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest way,\r\ndescended towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of\r\nthe lake’s bank. It was not without difficulty that they broke a path\r\nthrough the thickets and brushwood which had never been put aside by the\r\nhand of men, and they thus went towards the shore, so as to arrive at\r\nthe north of Prospect Heights. Two miles were cleared in this direction,\r\nand then, after they had passed the last curtain of trees, appeared the\r\nplateau, carpeted with thick turf, and beyond that the infinite sea.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely\r\nfor the space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow formed by\r\nthe first detour of the Mercy. But the engineer desired to know how\r\nand where the overplus of the water from the lake escaped, and the\r\nexploration was prolonged under the trees for a mile and a half towards\r\nthe north. It was most probable that an overfall existed somewhere, and\r\ndoubtless through a cleft in the granite. This lake was only, in short,\r\nan immense center basin, which was filled by degrees by the creek, and\r\nits waters must necessarily pass to the sea by some fall. If it was so,\r\nthe engineer thought that it might perhaps be possible to utilize this\r\nfall and borrow its power, actually lost without profit to any one.\r\nThey continued then to follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing the\r\nplateau; but, after having gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus Harding\r\nhad not been able to discover the overfall, which, however, must exist\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nIt was then half-past four. In order to prepare for dinner it was\r\nnecessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling. The little\r\nband retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left bank of the Mercy,\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the functions of\r\ncooks naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of Negro, to the\r\nother in that of sailor, quickly prepared some broiled agouti, to which\r\nthey did great justice.\r\n\r\nThe repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was about\r\nto give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his pocket little\r\nspecimens of different sorts of minerals, and just said,--\r\n\r\n“My friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay, this is\r\nlime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is our business\r\nto make a right use of them. To-morrow we will commence operations.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\n“Well, captain, where are we going to begin?” asked Pencroft next\r\nmorning of the engineer.\r\n\r\n“At the beginning,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin “at the very\r\nbeginning.” They did not possess even the tools necessary for making\r\ntools, and they were not even in the condition of nature, who, “having\r\ntime, husbands her strength.” They had no time, since they had to\r\nprovide for the immediate wants of their existence, and though,\r\nprofiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to invent, still they\r\nhad everything to make; their iron and their steel were as yet only in\r\nthe state of minerals, their earthenware in the state of clay, their\r\nlinen and their clothes in the state of textile material.\r\n\r\nIt must be said, however, that the settlers were “men” in the complete\r\nand higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could not have been\r\nseconded by more intelligent companions, nor with more devotion and\r\nzeal. He had tried them. He knew their abilities.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything so as to\r\nbe able to speak of everything, would contribute largely with his head\r\nand hands to the colonization of the island. He would not draw back from\r\nany task: a determined sportsman, he would make a business of what till\r\nthen had only been a pleasure to him.\r\n\r\nHerbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the natural\r\nsciences, would render greater service to the common cause.\r\n\r\nNeb was devotion personified. Clever, intelligent, indefatigable,\r\nrobust, with iron health, he knew a little about the work of the forge,\r\nand could not fail to be very useful in the colony.\r\n\r\nAs to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the\r\ndockyards in Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the state,\r\ngardener, cultivator, during his holidays, etc., and like all seamen,\r\nfit for anything, he knew how to do everything.\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to\r\nstruggle against fate, more certain to triumph over it.\r\n\r\n“At the beginning,” Cyrus Harding had said. Now this beginning of which\r\nthe engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would\r\nserve to transform the natural substances. The part which heat plays in\r\nthese transformations is known. Now fuel, wood or coal, was ready for\r\nimmediate use, an oven must be built to use it.\r\n\r\n“What is this oven for?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“To make the pottery which we have need of,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\n“And of what shall we make the oven?”\r\n\r\n“With bricks.”\r\n\r\n“And the bricks?”\r\n\r\n“With clay. Let us start, my friends. To save trouble, we will establish\r\nour manufactory at the place of production. Neb will bring provisions,\r\nand there will be no lack of fire to cook the food.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the reporter; “but if there is a lack of food for want of\r\ninstruments for the chase?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, if we only had a knife!” cried the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Well! I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could be\r\nplenty of game in the larder!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a knife, a sharp blade.” said the engineer, as if he was speaking\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nAt this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on the\r\nshore. Suddenly Harding’s face became animated.\r\n\r\n“Top, here,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe dog came at his master’s call. The latter took Top’s head between\r\nhis hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his\r\nneck, he broke it in two, saying,--\r\n\r\n“There are two knives, Pencroft!”\r\n\r\nTwo hurrahs from the sailor was the reply. Top’s collar was made of a\r\nthin piece of tempered steel. They had only to sharpen it on a piece of\r\nsandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone. Now sandstone was\r\nabundant on the beach, and two hours after the stock of tools in the\r\ncolony consisted of two sharp blades, which were easily fixed in solid\r\nhandles.\r\n\r\nThe production of these their first tools was hailed as a triumph. It\r\nwas indeed a valuable result of their labor, and a very opportune one.\r\nThey set out.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western shore of\r\nthe lake, where the day before he had noticed the clayey ground of which\r\nhe possessed a specimen. They therefore followed the bank of the Mercy,\r\ntraversed Prospect Heights, and after a walk of five miles or more they\r\nreached a glade, situated two hundred feet from Lake Grant.\r\n\r\nOn the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which the\r\nIndians of South America employ for making their bows. It was the\r\ncrejimba, of the palm family, which does not bear edible fruit. Long\r\nstraight branches were cut, the leaves stripped off; it was shaped,\r\nstronger in the middle, more slender at the extremities, and nothing\r\nremained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the bow-string.\r\nThis was the “hibiscus heterophyllus,” which furnishes fibers of such\r\nremarkable tenacity that they have been compared to the tendons of\r\nanimals. Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable strength, for which he\r\nonly wanted arrows. These were easily made with straight stiff branches,\r\nwithout knots, but the points with which they must be armed, that is\r\nto say, a substance to serve in lieu of iron, could not be met with so\r\neasily. But Pencroft said, that having done his part of the work, chance\r\nwould do the rest.\r\n\r\nThe settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the day\r\nbefore. Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making\r\nbricks and tiles, it was very useful for the work in question. There was\r\nno great difficulty in it. It was enough to scour the clay with sand,\r\nthen to mold the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire.\r\n\r\nGenerally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented himself\r\nwith making them by hand. All that day and the day following were\r\nemployed in this work. The clay, soaked in water, was mixed by the feet\r\nand hands of the manipulators, and then divided into pieces of equal\r\nsize. A practiced workman can make, without a machine, about ten\r\nthousand bricks in twelve hours; but in their two days work the five\r\nbrickmakers on Lincoln Island had not made more than three thousand,\r\nwhich were ranged near each other, until the time when their complete\r\ndesiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven, that is\r\nto say, in three or four days.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in fixing\r\nthe orientation of the island, or, in other words, the precise spot\r\nwhere the sun rose. The day before he had noted exactly the hour when\r\nthe sun disappeared beneath the horizon, making allowance for the\r\nrefraction. This morning he noted, no less exactly, the hour at which\r\nit reappeared. Between this setting and rising twelve hours, twenty-four\r\nminutes passed. Then, six hours, twelve minutes after its rising, the\r\nsun on this day would exactly pass the meridian and the point of the sky\r\nwhich it occupied at this moment would be the north. At the said hour,\r\nCyrus marked this point, and putting in a line with the sun two trees\r\nwhich would serve him for marks, he thus obtained an invariable meridian\r\nfor his ulterior operations.\r\n\r\nThe settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in\r\ncollecting fuel. Branches were cut all round the glade, and they picked\r\nup all the fallen wood under the trees. They were also able to hunt with\r\ngreater success, since Pencroft now possessed some dozen arrows armed\r\nwith sharp points. It was Top who had furnished these points, by bringing\r\nin a porcupine, rather inferior eating, but of great value, thanks to\r\nthe quills with which it bristled. These quills were fixed firmly at the\r\nends of the arrows, the flight of which was made more certain by some\r\ncockatoos’ feathers. The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful\r\narchers. Game of all sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys,\r\ncapybaras, pigeons, agouties, grouse, etc. The greater part of these\r\nanimals were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the\r\nMercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance of\r\nthe bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nThis game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara hams, by\r\nsmoking them above a fire of green wood, after having perfumed them with\r\nsweet-smelling leaves. However, this food, although very strengthening,\r\nwas always roast upon roast, and the party would have been delighted\r\nto hear some soup bubbling on the hearth, but they must wait till a pot\r\ncould be made, and, consequently, till the oven was built.\r\n\r\nDuring these excursions, which were not extended far from the\r\nbrick-field, the hunters could discern the recent passage of animals of\r\na large size, armed with powerful claws, but they could not recognize\r\nthe species. Cyrus Harding advised them to be very careful, as the\r\nforest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts.\r\n\r\nAnd he did right. Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an\r\nanimal which resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not attack\r\nthem, or they might not have escaped without a severe wound. As soon\r\nas he could get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of the guns which\r\nPencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make desperate war\r\nagainst the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island.\r\n\r\nThe Chimneys during these few days was not made more comfortable, for\r\nthe engineer hoped to discover, or build if necessary, a more convenient\r\ndwelling. They contented themselves with spreading moss and dry leaves\r\non the sand of the passages, and on these primitive couches the tired\r\nworkers slept soundly.\r\n\r\nThey also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island, and from\r\nthat time kept a regular account. The 5th of April, which was Wednesday,\r\nwas twelve days from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions were\r\ncollected in the glade, at the place where they were going to perform\r\nthe operation of baking the bricks. Naturally this had to be in the open\r\nair, and not in a kiln, or rather, the agglomeration of bricks made an\r\nenormous kiln, which would bake itself. The fuel, made of well-prepared\r\nfagots, was laid on the ground and surrounded with several rows of dried\r\nbricks, which soon formed an enormous cube, to the exterior of which\r\nthey contrived air-holes. The work lasted all day, and it was not till\r\nthe evening that they set fire to the fagots. No one slept that night,\r\nall watching carefully to keep up the fire.\r\n\r\nThe operation lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly. It then\r\nbecame necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and during this time\r\nNeb and Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding, brought, on a hurdle made of\r\ninterlaced branches, loads of carbonate of lime and common stones,\r\nwhich were very abundant, to the north of the lake. These stones, when\r\ndecomposed by heat, made a very strong quicklime, greatly increased by\r\nslacking, at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination\r\nof chalk or marble. Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar.\r\n\r\nThe result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of April,\r\nthe engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some\r\nthousands of bricks.\r\n\r\nWithout losing an instant, therefore, they began the construction of\r\na kiln to bake the pottery, which was indispensable for their domestic\r\nuse. They succeeded without much difficulty. Five days after, the kiln\r\nwas supplied with coal, which the engineer had discovered lying open to\r\nthe sky towards the mouth of the Red Creek, and the first smoke escaped\r\nfrom a chimney twenty feet high. The glade was transformed into a\r\nmanufactory, and Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this\r\nkiln would issue all the products of modern industry.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a common\r\npottery in which to cook their food. The chief material was clay, to\r\nwhich Harding added a little lime and quartz. This paste made regular\r\n“pipe-clay,” with which they manufactured bowls, cups molded on stones\r\nof a proper size, great jars and pots to hold water, etc. The shape of\r\nthese objects was clumsy and defective, but after they had been baked\r\nin a high temperature, the kitchen of the Chimneys was provided with a\r\nnumber of utensils, as precious to the settlers as the most beautifully\r\nenameled china. We must mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know if\r\nthe clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe-clay, made some\r\nlarge pipes, which he thought charming, but for which, alas! he had no\r\ntobacco, and that was a great privation to Pencroft. “But tobacco\r\nwill come, like everything else!” he repeated, in a burst of absolute\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThis work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well employed.\r\nThe settlers, having become potters, made nothing but pottery. When\r\nit suited Cyrus Harding to change them into smiths, they would become\r\nsmiths. But the next day being Sunday, and also Easter Sunday, all\r\nagreed to sanctify the day by rest. These Americans were religious men,\r\nscrupulous observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their situation\r\ncould not but develop sentiments of confidence towards the Author of all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the Chimneys,\r\ncarrying with them the pottery, the furnace being extinguished until\r\nthey could put it to a new use. Their return was marked by a fortunate\r\nincident; the engineer discovered a substance which replaced tinder.\r\nIt is known that a spongy, velvety flesh is procured from a certain\r\nmushroom of the genus polyporous. Properly prepared, it is extremely\r\ninflammable, especially when it has been previously saturated with\r\ngunpowder, or boiled in a solution of nitrate or chlorate of potash.\r\nBut, till then, they had not found any of these polypores or even any of\r\nthe morels which could replace them. On this day, the engineer, seeing\r\na plant belonging to the wormwood genus, the principal species of which\r\nare absinthe, balm-mint, tarragon, etc., gathered several tufts, and,\r\npresenting them to the sailor, said,--\r\n\r\n“Here, Pencroft, this will please you.”\r\n\r\nPencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long silky hair,\r\nthe leaves being clothed with soft down.\r\n\r\n“What’s that, captain?” asked Pencroft. “Is it tobacco?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Harding, “it is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the learned,\r\nbut to us it will be tinder.”\r\n\r\nWhen the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very\r\ninflammable substance, especially afterwards when the engineer had\r\nimpregnated it with nitrate of potash, of which the island possessed\r\nseveral beds, and which is in truth saltpeter.\r\n\r\nThe colonists had a good supper that evening. Neb prepared some agouti\r\nsoup, a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled tubercules of\r\nthe “caladium macrorhizum,” an herbaceous plant of the arum family.\r\nThey had an excellent taste, and were very nutritious, being something\r\nsimilar to the substance which is sold in England under the name of\r\n“Portland sago”; they were also a good substitute for bread, which the\r\nsettlers in Lincoln Island did not yet possess.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his companions\r\nwent to take the air on the beach. It was eight o’clock in the evening;\r\nthe night was magnificent. The moon, which had been full five days\r\nbefore, had not yet risen, but the horizon was already silvered by those\r\nsoft, pale shades which might be called the dawn of the moon. At the\r\nsouthern zenith glittered the circumpolar constellations, and above all\r\nthe Southern Cross, which some days before the engineer had greeted on\r\nthe summit of Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation, which\r\nhas at its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude, at\r\nits left arm a star of the second, and at its right arm a star of the\r\nthird magnitude.\r\n\r\nThen, after some minutes thought--\r\n\r\n“Herbert,” he asked of the lad, “is not this the 15th of April?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, captain,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four days in\r\nthe year in which the real time is identical with average time; that\r\nis to say, my boy, that to-morrow, to within some seconds, the sun will\r\npass the meridian just at midday by the clocks. If the weather is fine\r\nI think that I shall obtain the longitude of the island with an\r\napproximation of some degrees.”\r\n\r\n“Without instruments, without sextant?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the engineer. “Also, since the night is clear, I will\r\ntry, this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating the\r\nheight of the Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole above the\r\nhorizon. You understand, my friends, that before undertaking the work\r\nof installation in earnest it is not enough to have found out that this\r\nland is an island; we must, as nearly as possible, know at what distance\r\nit is situated, either from the American continent or Australia, or from\r\nthe principal archipelagoes of the Pacific.”\r\n\r\n“In fact,” said the reporter, “instead of building a house it would\r\nbe more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not more than a\r\nhundred miles from an inhabited coast.”\r\n\r\n“That is why,” returned Harding, “I am going to try this evening to\r\ncalculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to-morrow, at midday, I\r\nwill try to calculate the longitude.”\r\n\r\nIf the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which the\r\nangular distance of objects can be measured with great precision, there\r\nwould have been no difficulty in the operation. This evening by the\r\nheight of the pole, the next day by the passing of the sun at the\r\nmeridian, he would obtain the position of the island. But as they had\r\nnot one he would have to supply the deficiency.\r\n\r\nHarding then entered the Chimneys. By the light of the fire he cut two\r\nlittle flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so as to form\r\na pair of compasses, whose legs could separate or come together. The\r\nfastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which was found in the\r\nwood pile. This instrument finished, the engineer returned to the beach,\r\nbut as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a\r\nclear horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and as Claw Cape hid the southern\r\nhorizon, he was obliged to look for a more suitable station. The best\r\nwould evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south; but\r\nthe Mercy would have to be crossed, and that was a difficulty. Harding\r\nresolved, in consequence, to make his observation from Prospect Heights,\r\ntaking into consideration its height above the level of the sea--a\r\nheight which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process of\r\nelementary geometry.\r\n\r\nThe settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left bank of\r\nthe Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and\r\nsoutheast, that is, above the curiously-shaped rocks which bordered the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThis part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank, which\r\nsloped away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the southern side of\r\nthe island. No obstacle intercepted their gaze, which swept the horizon\r\nin a semi-circle from the cape to Reptile End. To the south the horizon,\r\nlighted by the first rays of the moon, was very clearly defined against\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an\r\ninverted position, the star Alpha marking its base, which is nearer to\r\nthe southern pole.\r\n\r\nThis constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole as the\r\nPolar Star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about twenty-seven\r\ndegrees from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made allowance for\r\nit in his calculation. He took care also to observe the moment when it\r\npassed the meridian below the pole, which would simplify the operation.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon, the\r\nother to Alpha, and the space between the two legs gave him the angular\r\ndistance which separated Alpha from the horizon. In order to fix the\r\nangle obtained, he fastened with thorns the two pieces of wood on a\r\nthird placed transversely, so that their separation should be properly\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThat done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the\r\nobservation to the level of the sea, taking into consideration the\r\ndepression of the horizon, which would necessitate measuring the height\r\nof the cliff. The value of this angle would give the height of Alpha,\r\nand consequently that of the pole above the horizon, that is to say, the\r\nlatitude of the island, since the latitude of a point of the globe is\r\nalways equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point.\r\n\r\nThe calculations were left for the next day, and at ten o’clock every\r\none was sleeping soundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers issued\r\nfrom the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their linen. The\r\nengineer intended to manufacture soap as soon as he could procure the\r\nnecessary materials--soda or potash, fat or oil. The important question\r\nof renewing their wardrobe would be treated of in the proper time and\r\nplace. At any rate their clothes would last at least six months longer,\r\nfor they were strong, and could resist the wear of manual labor. But\r\nall would depend on the situation of the island with regard to inhabited\r\nland. This would be settled to-day if the weather permitted.\r\n\r\nThe sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent day, one\r\nof those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the\r\nwarm season.\r\n\r\nIt was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before\r\nby measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n“Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used\r\nyesterday?” said Herbert to the engineer.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy,” replied the latter, “we are going to proceed differently,\r\nbut in as precise a way.”\r\n\r\nHerbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the engineer to\r\nthe beach. Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter remained behind and occupied\r\nthemselves in different ways.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding had provided himself with a straight stick, twelve feet\r\nlong, which he had measured as exactly as possible by comparing it with\r\nhis own height, which he knew to a hair. Herbert carried a plumb-line\r\nwhich Harding had given him, that is to say, a simple stone fastened\r\nto the end of a flexible fiber. Having reached a spot about twenty feet\r\nfrom the edge of the beach, and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff,\r\nwhich rose perpendicularly, Harding thrust the pole two feet into\r\nthe sand, and wedging it up carefully, he managed, by means of the\r\nplumb-line, to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat done, he retired the necessary distance, when, lying on the sand,\r\nhis eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of\r\nthe cliff. He carefully marked the place with a little stick.\r\n\r\nThen addressing Herbert--“Do you know the first principles of geometry?”\r\n he asked.\r\n\r\n“Slightly, captain,” replied Herbert, who did not wish to put himself\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n“You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Herbert; “their homologous sides are proportional.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy, I have just constructed two similar right-angled\r\ntriangles; the first, the smallest, has for its sides the perpendicular\r\npole, the distance which separates the little stick from the foot of the\r\npole and my visual ray for hypothenuse; the second has for its sides\r\nthe perpendicular cliff, the height of which we wish to measure, the\r\ndistance which separates the little stick from the bottom of the\r\ncliff, and my visual ray also forms its hypothenuse, which proves to be\r\nprolongation of that of the first triangle.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, captain, I understand!” cried Herbert. “As the distance from the\r\nstick to the pole is to the distance from the stick to the base of the\r\ncliff, so is the height of the pole to the height of the cliff.”\r\n\r\n“Just so, Herbert,” replied the engineer; “and when we have measured the\r\ntwo first distances, knowing the height of the pole, we shall only have\r\na sum in proportion to do, which will give us the height of the cliff,\r\nand will save us the trouble of measuring it directly.”\r\n\r\nThe two horizontal distances were found out by means of the pole, whose\r\nlength above the sand was exactly ten feet.\r\n\r\nThe first distance was fifteen feet between the stick and the place\r\nwhere the pole was thrust into the sand.\r\n\r\nThe second distance between the stick and the bottom of the cliff was\r\nfive hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThese measurements finished, Cyrus Harding and the lad returned to the\r\nChimneys.\r\n\r\nThe engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back from one\r\nof his previous excursions, a sort of slate, on which it was easy\r\nto trace figures with a sharp shell. He then proved the following\r\nproportions:--\r\n\r\n\r\n          15:500::10:x\r\n\r\n         500 x 10 = 5000\r\n\r\n        5000 / 15 = 333.3\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding then took the instrument which he had made the evening\r\nbefore, the space between its two legs giving the angular distance\r\nbetween the star Alpha and the horizon. He measured, very exactly, the\r\nopening of this angle on a circumference which he divided into 360 equal\r\nparts. Now, this angle by adding to it the twenty-seven degrees which\r\nseparated Alpha from the antarctic pole, and by reducing to the level of\r\nthe sea the height of the cliff on which the observation had been made,\r\nwas found to be fifty-three degrees. These fifty-three degrees being\r\nsubtracted from ninety degrees--the distance from the pole to the\r\nequator--there remained thirty-seven degrees. Cyrus Harding concluded,\r\ntherefore, that Lincoln Island was situated on the thirty-seventh degree\r\nof the southern latitude, or taking into consideration through the\r\nimperfection of the performance, an error of five degrees, that it must\r\nbe situated between the thirty-fifth and the fortieth parallel.\r\n\r\nThere was only the longitude to be obtained, and the position of the\r\nisland would be determined, The engineer hoped to attempt this the same\r\nday, at twelve o’clock, at which moment the sun would pass the meridian.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that Sunday should be spent in a walk, or rather an\r\nexploring expedition, to that side of the island between the north of\r\nthe lake and Shark Gulf, and if there was time they would push their\r\ndiscoveries to the northern side of Cape South Mandible. They would\r\nbreakfast on the downs, and not return till evening.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight the little band was following the edge of the\r\nchannel. On the other side, on Safety Islet, numerous birds were gravely\r\nstrutting. They were divers, easily recognized by their cry, which much\r\nresembles the braying of a donkey. Pencroft only considered them in\r\nan eatable point of view, and learnt with some satisfaction that their\r\nflesh, though blackish, is not bad food.\r\n\r\nGreat amphibious creatures could also be seen crawling on the sand;\r\nseals, doubtless, who appeared to have chosen the islet for a place of\r\nrefuge. It was impossible to think of those animals in an alimentary\r\npoint of view, for their oily flesh is detestable; however, Cyrus\r\nHarding observed them attentively, and without making known his idea, he\r\nannounced to his companions that very soon they would pay a visit to the\r\nislet. The beach was strewn with innumerable shells, some of which would\r\nhave rejoiced the heart of a conchologist; there were, among others, the\r\nphasianella, the terebratual, etc. But what would be of more use, was\r\nthe discovery, by Neb, at low tide, of a large oysterbed among the\r\nrocks, nearly five miles from the Chimneys.\r\n\r\n“Neb will not have lost his day,” cried Pencroft, looking at the\r\nspacious oyster-bed.\r\n\r\n“It is really a fortunate discovery,” said the reporter, “and as it is\r\nsaid that each oyster produces yearly from fifty to sixty thousand eggs,\r\nwe shall have an inexhaustible supply there.”\r\n\r\n“Only I believe that the oyster is not very nourishing,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Harding. “The oyster contains very little nitrogen, and\r\nif a man lived exclusively on them, he would have to eat not less than\r\nfifteen to sixteen dozen a day.”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” replied Pencroft. “We might swallow dozens and dozens without\r\nexhausting the bed. Shall we take some for breakfast?”\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting for a reply to this proposal, knowing that it would\r\nbe approved of, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of the molluscs.\r\nThey put them in a sort of net of hibiscus fiber, which Neb had\r\nmanufactured, and which already contained food; they then continued to\r\nclimb the coast between the downs and the sea.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Harding consulted his watch, so as to be prepared in\r\ntime for the solar observation, which had to be made exactly at midday.\r\n\r\nAll that part of the island was very barren as far as the point\r\nwhich closed Union Bay, and which had received the name of Cape South\r\nMandible. Nothing could be seen there but sand and shells, mingled with\r\ndebris of lava. A few sea-birds frequented this desolate coast, gulls,\r\ngreat albatrosses, as well as wild duck, for which Pencroft had a great\r\nfancy. He tried to knock some over with an arrow, but without result,\r\nfor they seldom perched, and he could not hit them on the wing.\r\n\r\nThis led the sailor to repeat to the engineer,--\r\n\r\n“You see, captain, so long as we have not one or two fowling-pieces, we\r\nshall never get anything!”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, Pencroft,” replied the reporter, “but it depends on you.\r\nProcure us some iron for the barrels, steel for the hammers, saltpeter.\r\ncoal and sulphur for powder, mercury and nitric acid for the fulminate,\r\nand lead for the shot, and the captain will make us first-rate guns.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied the engineer, “we might, no doubt, find all these\r\nsubstances on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument, and needs\r\nvery particular tools. However, we shall see later!”\r\n\r\n“Why,” cried Pencroft, “were we obliged to throw overboard all the\r\nweapons we had with us in the car, all our implements, even our\r\npocket-knives?”\r\n\r\n“But if we had not thrown them away, Pencroft, the balloon would have\r\nthrown us to the bottom of the sea!” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“What you say is true, my boy,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\nThen passing to another idea,--“Think,” said he, “how astounded Jonathan\r\nForster and his companions must have been when, next morning, they found\r\nthe place empty, and the machine flown away!”\r\n\r\n“I am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought,”\r\n said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“It was all my idea, that!” said Pencroft, with a satisfied air.\r\n\r\n“A splendid idea, Pencroft!” replied Gideon Spilett, laughing, “and\r\nwhich has placed us where we are.”\r\n\r\n“I would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,” cried the\r\nsailor, “especially since the captain has been kind enough to come and\r\njoin us again.”\r\n\r\n“So would I, truly!” replied the reporter. “Besides, what do we want?\r\nNothing.”\r\n\r\n“If that is not--everything!” replied Pencroft, laughing and shrugging\r\nhis shoulders. “But, some day or other, we shall find means of going\r\naway!”\r\n\r\n“Sooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends,” remarked the engineer,\r\n“if Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an inhabited island,\r\nor from a continent. We shall know in an hour. I have not a map of the\r\nPacific, but my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of\r\nits southern part. The latitude which I obtained yesterday placed New\r\nZealand to the west of Lincoln Island, and the coast of Chile to the\r\neast. But between these two countries, there is a distance of at least\r\nsix thousand miles. It has, therefore, to be determined what point in\r\nthis great space the island occupies, and this the longitude will give\r\nus presently, with a sufficient approximation, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“Is not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us in\r\nlatitude?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the engineer, “but the distance which separates us from\r\nit is more than twelve hundred miles.”\r\n\r\n“And that way?” asked Neb, who followed the conversation with extreme\r\ninterest, pointing to the south.\r\n\r\n“That way, nothing,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, indeed,” added the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Well, Cyrus,” asked the reporter, “if Lincoln Island is not more than\r\ntwo or three thousand miles from New Zealand or Chile?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the engineer, “instead of building a house we will build\r\na boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in command--”\r\n\r\n“Well then,” cried the sailor, “I am quite ready to be captain--as soon\r\nas you can make a craft that’s able to keep at sea!”\r\n\r\n“We shall do it, if it is necessary,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nBut while these men, who really hesitated at nothing, were talking,\r\nthe hour approached at which the observation was to be made. What Cyrus\r\nHarding was to do to ascertain the passage of the sun at the meridian of\r\nthe island, without an instrument of any sort, Herbert could not guess.\r\n\r\nThe observers were then about six miles from the Chimneys, not far from\r\nthat part of the downs in which the engineer had been found after his\r\nenigmatical preservation. They halted at this place and prepared for\r\nbreakfast, for it was half-past eleven. Herbert went for some fresh\r\nwater from a stream which ran near, and brought it back in a jug, which\r\nNeb had provided.\r\n\r\nDuring these preparations Harding arranged everything for his\r\nastronomical observation. He chose a clear place on the shore, which\r\nthe ebbing tide had left perfectly level. This bed of fine sand was as\r\nsmooth as ice, not a grain out of place. It was of little importance\r\nwhether it was horizontal or not, and it did not matter much whether the\r\nstick six feet high, which was planted there, rose perpendicularly. On\r\nthe contrary, the engineer inclined it towards the south, that is to\r\nsay, in the direction of the coast opposite to the sun, for it must\r\nnot be forgotten that the settlers in Lincoln Island, as the island was\r\nsituated in the Southern Hemisphere, saw the radiant planet describe its\r\ndiurnal arc above the northern, and not above the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nHerbert now understood how the engineer was going to proceed to\r\nascertain the culmination of the sun, that is to say its passing the\r\nmeridian of the island or, in other words, determine due south. It was\r\nby means of the shadow cast on the sand by the stick, a way which, for\r\nwant of an instrument, would give him a suitable approach to the result\r\nwhich he wished to obtain.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of length\r\nwould be exactly twelve o’clock, and it would be enough to watch the\r\nextremity of the shadow, so as to ascertain the instant when, after\r\nhaving successively diminished, it began to lengthen. By inclining his\r\nstick to the side opposite to the sun, Cyrus Harding made the shadow\r\nlonger, and consequently its modifications would be more easily\r\nascertained. In fact, the longer the needle of a dial is, the more\r\neasily can the movement of its point be followed. The shadow of the\r\nstick was nothing but the needle of a dial. The moment had come, and\r\nCyrus Harding knelt on the sand, and with little wooden pegs, which he\r\nstuck into the sand, he began to mark the successive diminutions of the\r\nstick’s shadow. His companions, bending over him, watched the operation\r\nwith extreme interest. The reporter held his chronometer in his hand,\r\nready to tell the hour which it marked when the shadow would be at its\r\nshortest. Moreover, as Cyrus Harding was working on the 16th of April,\r\nthe day on which the true and the average time are identical, the hour\r\ngiven by Gideon Spilett would be the true hour then at Washington, which\r\nwould simplify the calculation. Meanwhile as the sun slowly advanced,\r\nthe shadow slowly diminished, and when it appeared to Cyrus Harding that\r\nit was beginning to increase, he asked, “What o’clock is it?”\r\n\r\n“One minute past five,” replied Gideon Spilett directly. They had now\r\nonly to calculate the operation. Nothing could be easier. It could be\r\nseen that there existed, in round numbers, a difference of five hours\r\nbetween the meridian of Washington and that of Lincoln Island, that is\r\nto say, it was midday in Lincoln Island when it was already five o’clock\r\nin the evening in Washington. Now the sun, in its apparent movement\r\nround the earth, traverses one degree in four minutes, or fifteen\r\ndegrees an hour. Fifteen degrees multiplied by five hours give\r\nseventy-five degrees.\r\n\r\nThen, since Washington is 77deg 3’ 11” as much as to say seventy-seven\r\ndegrees counted from the meridian of Greenwich which the Americans\r\ntake for their starting-point for longitudes concurrently with the\r\nEnglish--it followed that the island must be situated seventy-seven and\r\nseventy-five degrees west of the meridian of Greenwich, that is to say,\r\non the hundred and fifty-second degree of west longitude.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding announced this result to his companions, and taking into\r\nconsideration errors of observation, as he had done for the latitude, he\r\nbelieved he could positively affirm that the position of Lincoln Island\r\nwas between the thirty-fifth and the thirty-seventh parallel, and\r\nbetween the hundred and fiftieth and the hundred and fifty-fifth\r\nmeridian to the west of the meridian of Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThe possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was,\r\nit may be seen, of five degrees on both sides, which, at sixty miles\r\nto a degree, would give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and\r\nlongitude for the exact position.\r\n\r\nBut this error would not influence the determination which it was\r\nnecessary to take. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was at such a\r\ndistance from every country or island that it would be too hazardous to\r\nattempt to reach one in a frail boat.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred miles from\r\nTahiti and the islands of the archipelago of the Pomoutous, more than\r\neighteen hundred miles from New Zealand, and more than four thousand\r\nfive hundred miles from the American coast!\r\n\r\nAnd when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not remember in\r\nany way that such an island occupied, in that part of the Pacific, the\r\nsituation assigned to Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 17th of April, the sailor’s first words were addressed\r\nto Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” he asked, “what shall we do to-day?”\r\n\r\n“What the captain pleases,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\nTill then the engineer’s companions had been brickmakers and potters,\r\nnow they were to become metallurgists.\r\n\r\nThe day before, after breakfast, they had explored as far as the point\r\nof Mandible Cape, seven miles distant from the Chimneys. There, the long\r\nseries of downs ended, and the soil had a volcanic appearance. There\r\nwere no longer high cliffs as at Prospect Heights, but a strange and\r\ncapricious border which surrounded the narrow gulf between the two\r\ncapes, formed of mineral matter, thrown up by the volcano. Arrived at\r\nthis point the settlers retraced their steps, and at nightfall entered\r\nthe Chimneys; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing\r\nwhether they could think of leaving Lincoln Island or not was definitely\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThe twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the Pomoutous\r\nIsland was a considerable distance. A boat could not cross it,\r\nespecially at the approach of the bad season. Pencroft had expressly\r\ndeclared this. Now, to construct a simple boat even with the necessary\r\ntools, was a difficult work, and the colonists not having tools they\r\nmust begin by making hammers, axes, adzes, saws, augers, planes, etc.,\r\nwhich would take some time. It was decided, therefore, that they\r\nwould winter at Lincoln Island, and that they would look for a more\r\ncomfortable dwelling than the Chimneys, in which to pass the winter\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nBefore anything else could be done it was necessary to make the iron\r\nore, of which the engineer had observed some traces in the northwest\r\npart of the island, fit for use by converting it either into iron or\r\ninto steel.\r\n\r\nMetals are not generally found in the ground in a pure state. For the\r\nmost part they are combined with oxygen or sulphur. Such was the case\r\nwith the two specimens which Cyrus Harding had brought back, one of\r\nmagnetic iron, not carbonated, the other a pyrite, also called sulphuret\r\nof iron. It was, therefore the first, the oxide of iron, which they must\r\nreduce with coal, that is to say, get rid of the oxygen, to obtain it in\r\na pure state. This reduction is made by subjecting the ore with coal to\r\na high temperature, either by the rapid and easy Catalan method,\r\nwhich has the advantage of transforming the ore into iron in a single\r\noperation, or by the blast furnace, which first smelts the ore, then\r\nchanges it into iron, by carrying away the three to four per cent. of\r\ncoal, which is combined with it.\r\n\r\nNow Cyrus Harding wanted iron, and he wished to obtain it as soon as\r\npossible. The ore which he had picked up was in itself very pure and\r\nrich. It was the oxydulous iron, which is found in confused masses of a\r\ndeep gray color; it gives a black dust, crystallized in the form of the\r\nregular octahedron. Native lodestones consist of this ore, and iron\r\nof the first quality is made in Europe from that with which Sweden and\r\nNorway are so abundantly supplied. Not far from this vein was the vein\r\nof coal already made use of by the settlers. The ingredients for the\r\nmanufacture being close together would greatly facilitate the treatment\r\nof the ore. This is the cause of the wealth of the mines in Great\r\nBritain, where the coal aids the manufacture of the metal extracted from\r\nthe same soil at the same time as itself.\r\n\r\n“Then, captain,” said Pencroft, “we are going to work iron ore?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend,” replied the engineer, “and for that--something which\r\nwill please you--we must begin by having a seal hunt on the islet.”\r\n\r\n“A seal hunt!” cried the sailor, turning towards Gideon Spilett. “Are\r\nseals needed to make iron?”\r\n\r\n“Since Cyrus has said so!” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\nBut the engineer had already left the Chimneys, and Pencroft prepared\r\nfor the seal hunt, without having received any other explanation.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb, and the sailor were\r\nsoon collected on the shore, at a place where the channel left a ford\r\npassable at low tide. The hunters could therefore traverse it without\r\ngetting wet higher than the knee.\r\n\r\nHarding then put his foot on the islet for the first, and his companions\r\nfor the second time.\r\n\r\nOn their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at them.\r\nThe hunters, armed with sticks, could have killed them easily, but they\r\nwere not guilty of such useless massacre, as it was important not to\r\nfrighten the seals, who were lying on the sand several cable lengths\r\noff. They also respected certain innocent-looking birds, whose wings\r\nwere reduced to the state of stumps, spread out like fins, ornamented\r\nwith feathers of a scaly appearance. The settlers, therefore, prudently\r\nadvanced towards the north point, walking over ground riddled with\r\nlittle holes, which formed nests for the sea-birds. Towards the\r\nextremity of the islet appeared great black heads floating just above\r\nthe water, having exactly the appearance of rocks in motion.\r\n\r\nThese were the seals which were to be captured. It was necessary,\r\nhowever, first to allow them to land, for with their close, short\r\nhair, and their fusiform conformation, being excellent swimmers, it is\r\ndifficult to catch them in the sea, while on land their short, webbed\r\nfeet prevent their having more than a slow, waddling movement.\r\n\r\nPencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised waiting till\r\nthey were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before long, would send\r\nthem to sleep. They must then manage to cut off their retreat and knock\r\nthem on the head.\r\n\r\nThe hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks, waited\r\nsilently.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand. They could\r\ncount half a dozen. Pencroft and Herbert then went round the point of\r\nthe islet, so as to take them in the rear, and cut off their retreat.\r\nDuring this time Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Neb, crawling behind the\r\nrocks, glided towards the future scene of combat.\r\n\r\nAll at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared. Pencroft shouted.\r\nThe engineer and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and\r\nthe seals. Two of the animals soon lay dead on the sand, but the rest\r\nregained the sea in safety.\r\n\r\n“Here are the seals required, captain!” said the sailor, advancing\r\ntowards the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Capital,” replied Harding. “We will make bellows of them!”\r\n\r\n“Bellows!” cried Pencroft. “Well! these are lucky seals!”\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, a blowing-machine, necessary for the treatment of\r\nthe ore that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins of the\r\namphibious creatures. They were of a medium size, for their length did\r\nnot exceed six feet. They resembled a dog about the head.\r\n\r\nAs it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both the\r\nanimals, Neb and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot, while Cyrus\r\nHarding and the reporter continued to explore the islet.\r\n\r\nThe sailor and the Negro cleverly performed the operation, and three\r\nhours afterwards Cyrus Harding had at his disposal two seals’ skins,\r\nwhich he intended to use in this state, without subjecting them to any\r\ntanning process.\r\n\r\nThe settlers waited till the tide was again low, and crossing the\r\nchannel they entered the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe skins had then to be stretched on a frame of wood and sewn by means\r\nof fibers so as to preserve the air without allowing too much to escape.\r\nCyrus Harding had nothing but the two steel blades from Top’s collar,\r\nand yet he was so clever, and his companions aided him with so much\r\nintelligence, that three days afterwards the little colony’s stock of\r\ntools was augmented by a blowing-machine, destined to inject the air\r\ninto the midst of the ore when it should be subjected to heat--an\r\nindispensable condition to the success of the operation.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th of April began the “metallic period,” as the\r\nreporter called it in his notes. The engineer had decided, as has been\r\nsaid, to operate near the veins both of coal and ore. Now, according to\r\nhis observations, these veins were situated at the foot of the northeast\r\nspurs of Mount Franklin, that is to say, a distance of six miles from\r\ntheir home. It was impossible, therefore, to return every day to the\r\nChimneys, and it was agreed that the little colony should camp under a\r\nhut of branches, so that the important operation could be followed night\r\nand day.\r\n\r\nThis settled, they set out in the morning. Neb and Pencroft dragged the\r\nbellows on a hurdle; also a quantity of vegetables and animals, which\r\nthey besides could renew on the way.\r\n\r\nThe road led through Jacamar Wood, which they traversed obliquely from\r\nsoutheast to northwest, and in the thickest part. It was necessary to\r\nbeat a path, which would in the future form the most direct road to\r\nProspect Heights and Mount Franklin. The trees, belonging to the species\r\nalready discovered, were magnificent. Herbert found some new ones, among\r\nothers some which Pencroft called “sham leeks”; for, in spite of their\r\nsize, they were of the same liliaceous family as the onion, chive,\r\nshallot, or asparagus. These trees produce ligneous roots which, when\r\ncooked, are excellent; from them, by fermentation, a very agreeable\r\nliquor is made. They therefore made a good store of the roots.\r\n\r\nThe journey through the wood was long; it lasted the whole day, and so\r\nallowed plenty of time for examining the flora and fauna. Top, who\r\ntook special charge of the fauna, ran through the grass and brushwood,\r\nputting up all sorts of game. Herbert and Gideon Spilett killed two\r\nkangaroos with bows and arrows, and also an animal which strongly\r\nresembled both a hedgehog and an ant-eater. It was like the first\r\nbecause it rolled itself into a ball, and bristled with spines, and the\r\nsecond because it had sharp claws, a long slender snout which terminated\r\nin a bird’s beak, and an extendible tongue, covered with little thorns\r\nwhich served to hold the insects.\r\n\r\n“And when it is in the pot,” asked Pencroft naturally, “what will it be\r\nlike?”\r\n\r\n“An excellent piece of beef,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“We will not ask more from it,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\nDuring this excursion they saw several wild boars, which however, did\r\nnot offer to attack the little band, and it appeared as if they would\r\nnot meet with any dangerous beasts; when, in a thick part of the wood,\r\nthe reporter thought he saw, some paces from him, among the lower\r\nbranches of a tree, an animal which he took for a bear, and which he\r\nvery tranquilly began to draw. Happily for Gideon Spilett, the animal in\r\nquestion did not belong to the redoubtable family of the plantigrades.\r\nIt was only a koala, better known under the name of the sloth, being\r\nabout the size of a large dog, and having stiff hair of a dirty color,\r\nthe paws armed with strong claws, which enabled it to climb trees and\r\nfeed on the leaves. Having identified the animal, which they did not\r\ndisturb, Gideon Spilett erased “bear” from the title of his sketch,\r\nputting koala in its place, and the journey was resumed.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock in the evening, Cyrus Harding gave the signal to halt.\r\nThey were now outside the forest, at the beginning of the powerful spurs\r\nwhich supported Mount Franklin towards the west. At a distance of some\r\nhundred feet flowed the Red Creek, and consequently plenty of fresh\r\nwater was within their reach.\r\n\r\nThe camp was soon organized. In less than an hour, on the edge of the\r\nforest, among the trees, a hut of branches interlaced with creepers,\r\nand pasted over with clay, offered a tolerable shelter. Their geological\r\nresearches were put off till the next day. Supper was prepared, a good\r\nfire blazed before the hut, the roast turned, and at eight o’clock,\r\nwhile one of the settlers watched to keep up the fire, in case any wild\r\nbeasts should prowl in the neighborhood, the others slept soundly.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Harding accompanied by Herbert,\r\nwent to look for the soil of ancient formation, on which he had already\r\ndiscovered a specimen of ore. They found the vein above ground, near the\r\nsource of the creek, at the foot of one of the northeastern spurs. This\r\nore, very rich in iron, enclosed in its fusible veinstone, was perfectly\r\nsuited to the mode of reduction which the engineer intended to employ;\r\nthat is, the Catalan method, but simplified, as it is used in\r\nCorsica. In fact, the Catalan method, properly so called, requires the\r\nconstruction of kilns and crucibles, in which the ore and the coal,\r\nplaced in alternate layers, are transformed and reduced, But Cyrus\r\nHarding intended to economize these constructions, and wished simply to\r\nform, with the ore and the coal, a cubic mass, to the center of which he\r\nwould direct the wind from his bellows. Doubtless, it was the proceeding\r\nemployed by Tubalcain, and the first metallurgists of the inhabited\r\nworld. Now that which had succeeded with the grandson of Adam, and which\r\nstill yielded good results in countries rich in ore and fuel, could not\r\nbut succeed with the settlers in Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nThe coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on the\r\nsurface of the ground. They first broke the ore into little pieces,\r\nand cleansed them with the hand from the impurities which soiled their\r\nsurface. Then coal and ore were arranged in heaps and in successive\r\nlayers, as the charcoal-burner does with the wood which he wishes to\r\ncarbonize. In this way, under the influence of the air projected by the\r\nblowing-machine, the coal would be transformed into carbonic acid, then\r\ninto oxide of carbon, its use being to reduce the oxide of iron, that is\r\nto say, to rid it of the oxygen.\r\n\r\nThus the engineer proceeded. The bellows of sealskin, furnished at its\r\nextremity with a nozzle of clay, which had been previously fabricated\r\nin the pottery kiln, was established near the heap of ore. Using the\r\nmechanism which consisted of a frame, cords of fiber and counterpoise,\r\nhe threw into the mass an abundance of air, which by raising the\r\ntemperature also concurred with the chemical transformation to produce\r\nin time pure iron.\r\n\r\nThe operation was difficult. All the patience, all the ingenuity of the\r\nsettlers was needed; but at last it succeeded, and the result was a lump\r\nof iron, reduced to a spongy state, which it was necessary to shingle\r\nand fagot, that is to say, to forge so as to expel from it the liquefied\r\nveinstone. These amateur smiths had, of course, no hammer; but they were\r\nin no worse a situation than the first metallurgist, and therefore did\r\nwhat, no doubt, he had to do.\r\n\r\nA handle was fixed to the first lump, and was used as a hammer to forge\r\nthe second on a granite anvil, and thus they obtained a coarse but\r\nuseful metal. At length, after many trials and much fatigue, on the 25th\r\nof April several bars of iron were forged, and transformed into tools,\r\ncrowbars, pincers, pickaxes, spades, etc., which Pencroft and Neb\r\ndeclared to be real jewels. But the metal was not yet in its most\r\nserviceable state, that is, of steel. Now steel is a combination of iron\r\nand coal, which is extracted, either from the liquid ore, by taking from\r\nit the excess of coal, or from the iron by adding to it the coal which\r\nwas wanting. The first, obtained by the decarburation of the metal,\r\ngives natural or puddled steel; the second, produced by the carburation\r\nof the iron, gives steel of cementation.\r\n\r\nIt was the last which Cyrus Harding intended to forge, as he possessed\r\niron in a pure state. He succeeded by heating the metal with powdered\r\ncoal in a crucible which had previously been manufactured from clay\r\nsuitable for the purpose.\r\n\r\nHe then worked this steel, which is malleable both when hot or cold,\r\nwith the hammer. Neb and Pencroft, cleverly directed, made hatchets,\r\nwhich, heated red-hot, and plunged suddenly into cold water, acquired an\r\nexcellent temper.\r\n\r\nOther instruments, of course roughly fashioned, were also manufactured;\r\nblades for planes, axes, hatchets, pieces of steel to be transformed\r\ninto saws, chisels; then iron for spades, pickaxes, hammers, nails,\r\netc. At last, on the 5th of May, the metallic period ended, the smiths\r\nreturned to the Chimneys, and new work would soon authorize them to take\r\na fresh title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nIt was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of November in\r\nthe countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had been obscured for\r\nsome days, and it was of importance to make preparations for the winter.\r\nHowever, the temperature was not as yet much lower, and a centigrade\r\nthermometer, transported to Lincoln Island, would still have marked an\r\naverage of ten to twelve degrees above zero. This was not surprising,\r\nsince Lincoln Island, probably situated between the thirty-fifth and\r\nfortieth parallel, would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to\r\nthe same climate as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as\r\nGreece and Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless\r\nwould Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was\r\nadvisable to provide against it.\r\n\r\nIn any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season would\r\nbegin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of the\r\nelements, in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and probably\r\nterrible. The question of a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys\r\nmust therefore be seriously considered and promptly resolved on.\r\n\r\nPencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which he\r\nhad discovered, but he well understood that another must be found. The\r\nChimneys had been already visited by the sea, under circumstances\r\nwhich are known, and it would not do to be exposed again to a similar\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of these things\r\nwith his companions, “we have some precautions to take.”\r\n\r\n“Why? The island is not inhabited,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“That is probable,” replied the engineer, “although we have not yet\r\nexplored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear that\r\ndangerous animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against a\r\npossible attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every night,\r\nor to keep up a fire. And then, my friends, we must foresee everything.\r\nWe are here in a part of the Pacific often frequented by Malay\r\npirates--”\r\n\r\n“What!” said Herbert, “at such a distance from land?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer. “These pirates are bold sailors as\r\nwell as formidable enemies, and we must take measures accordingly.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Pencroft, “we will fortify ourselves against savages\r\nwith two legs as well as against savages with four. But, captain, will\r\nit not be best to explore every part of the island before undertaking\r\nanything else?”\r\n\r\n“That would be best,” added Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Who knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns\r\nwhich we have searched for in vain here?”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” replied the engineer, “but you forget, my friends, that\r\nit will be necessary to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a\r\nwatercourse, and that, from the summit of Mount Franklin, we could not\r\nsee towards the west, either stream or river. Here, on the contrary, we\r\nare placed between the Mercy and Lake Grant, an advantage which must not\r\nbe neglected. And, besides, this side, looking towards the east, is not\r\nexposed as the other is to the trade-winds, which in this hemisphere\r\nblow from the northwest.”\r\n\r\n“Then, captain,” replied the sailor, “let us build a house on the edge\r\nof the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now. After having been\r\nbrickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we shall surely know how to\r\nbe masons!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must consider\r\nthe matter thoroughly. A natural dwelling would spare us much work,\r\nand would be a surer retreat, for it would be as well defended against\r\nenemies from the interior as those from outside.”\r\n\r\n“That is true, Cyrus,” replied the reporter, “but we have already\r\nexamined all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole, not a\r\ncranny!”\r\n\r\n“No, not one!” added Pencroft. “Ah, if we were able to dig out a\r\ndwelling in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the reach\r\nof harm, that would be capital! I can see that on the front which looks\r\nseaward, five or six rooms--”\r\n\r\n“With windows to light them!” said Herbert, laughing.\r\n\r\n“And a staircase to climb up to them!” added Neb.\r\n\r\n“You are laughing,” cried the sailor, “and why? What is there impossible\r\nin what I propose? Haven’t we got pickaxes and spades? Won’t Captain\r\nHarding be able to make powder to blow up the mine? Isn’t it true,\r\ncaptain, that you will make powder the very day we want it?”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing his\r\nfanciful projects. To attack this mass of granite, even by a mine, was\r\nHerculean work, and it was really vexing that nature could not help them\r\nat their need. But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by\r\nproposing to examine the cliff more attentively, from the mouth of the\r\nriver to the angle which terminated it on the north.\r\n\r\nThey went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with extreme\r\ncare, over an extent of nearly two miles. But in no place in the bare,\r\nstraight cliff, could any cavity be found. The nests of the rock pigeons\r\nwhich fluttered at its summit were only, in reality, holes bored at the\r\nvery top, and on the irregular edge of the granite.\r\n\r\nIt was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff, either\r\nwith pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient excavation, it\r\nwas not to be thought of. It so happened that, on all this part of the\r\nshore, Pencroft had discovered the only habitable shelter, that is to\r\nsay, the Chimneys, which now had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the north angle\r\nof the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which died away on the\r\nshore. From this place, to its extreme limit in the west, it only formed\r\na sort of declivity, a thick mass of stones, earth, and sand, bound\r\ntogether by plants, bushes, and grass inclined at an angle of only\r\nforty-five degrees. Clumps of trees grew on these slopes, which were\r\nalso carpeted with thick grass. But the vegetation did not extend\r\nfar, and a long, sandy plain, which began at the foot of these slopes,\r\nreached to the beach.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of the lake\r\nmust overflow on this side. The excess of water furnished by the Red\r\nCreek must also escape by some channel or other. Now the engineer had\r\nnot yet found this channel on any part of the shore already explored,\r\nthat is to say, from the mouth of the stream on the west of Prospect\r\nHeights.\r\n\r\nThe engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope, and to\r\nreturn to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the northern\r\nand eastern shores of the lake. The proposal was accepted, and in a few\r\nminutes Herbert and Neb were on the upper plateau. Cyrus Harding, Gideon\r\nSpilett, and Pencroft followed with more sedate steps.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays\r\nof the sun. In this direction the country was charming. The eye feasted\r\non the groups of trees. Some old trunks, bent with age, showed black\r\nagainst the verdant grass which covered the ground. Crowds of brilliant\r\ncockatoos screamed among the branches, moving prisms, hopping from one\r\nbough to another.\r\n\r\nThe settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the lake,\r\nmade a circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join the mouth\r\nof the creek on its left bank. It was a detour of more than a mile and a\r\nhalf. Walking was easy, for the trees widely spread, left a considerable\r\nspace between them. The fertile zone evidently stopped at this point,\r\nand vegetation would be less vigorous in the part between the course of\r\nthe Creek and the Mercy.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground with great\r\ncare. Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points were their only\r\nweapons. However, no wild beast showed itself, and it was probable that\r\nthese animals frequented rather the thick forests in the south; but the\r\nsettlers had the disagreeable surprise of seeing Top stop before a snake\r\nof great size, measuring from fourteen to fifteen feet in length. Neb\r\nkilled it by a blow from his stick. Cyrus Harding examined the reptile,\r\nand declared it not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond\r\nserpents which the natives of New South Wales rear. But it was possible\r\nthat others existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with\r\nforked tails, which rise up under the feet, or those winged snakes,\r\nfurnished with two ears, which enable them to proceed with great\r\nrapidity. Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile chase\r\nwith such eagerness, that they feared for his safety. His master called\r\nhim back directly.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into the lake,\r\nwas soon reached. The explorers recognized on the opposite shore the\r\npoint which they had visited on their descent from Mount Franklin. Cyrus\r\nHarding ascertained that the flow of water into it from the creek was\r\nconsiderable. Nature must therefore have provided some place for the\r\nescape of the overplus. This doubtless formed a fall, which, if it could\r\nbe discovered, would be of great use.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each other,\r\nbegan to skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep. The water\r\nappeared to be full of fish, and Pencroft resolved to make some\r\nfishing-rods, so as to try and catch some.\r\n\r\nThe northeast point was first to be doubled. It might have been supposed\r\nthat the discharge of water was at this place, for the extremity of the\r\nlake was almost on a level with the edge of the plateau. But no signs of\r\nthis were discovered, and the colonists continued to explore the bank,\r\nwhich, after a slight bend, descended parallel to the shore.\r\n\r\nOn this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees, here and\r\nthere, added to the picturesqueness of the country. Lake Grant was\r\nviewed from thence in all its extent, and no breath disturbed the\r\nsurface of its waters. Top, in beating the bushes, put up flocks of\r\nbirds of different kinds, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert saluted with\r\narrows. One was hit by the lad, and fell into some marshy grass. Top\r\nrushed forward, and brought a beautiful swimming bird, of a slate color,\r\nshort beak, very developed frontal plate, and wings edged with white. It\r\nwas a “coot,” the size of a large partridge, belonging to the group of\r\nmacrodactyls which form the transition between the order of wading birds\r\nand that of palmipeds. Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from\r\npleasant. But Top was not so particular in these things as his masters,\r\nand it was agreed that the coot should be for his supper.\r\n\r\nThe settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake, and they\r\nwould not be long in reaching the part which they already knew.\r\nThe engineer was much surprised at not seeing any indication of the\r\ndischarge of water. The reporter and the sailor talked with him, and he\r\ncould not conceal his astonishment.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave signs of\r\nagitation. The intelligent animal went backwards and forwards on the\r\nshore, stopped suddenly, and looked at the water, one paw raised, as if\r\nhe was pointing at some invisible game; then he barked furiously, and\r\nwas suddenly silent.\r\n\r\nNeither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any attention\r\nto Top’s behavior; but the dog’s barking soon became so frequent that\r\nthe engineer noticed it.\r\n\r\n“What is there, Top?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy, and then\r\nrushed again towards the bank. Then, all at once, he plunged into the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n“Here, Top!” cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to venture\r\ninto the treacherous water.\r\n\r\n“What’s happening down there?” asked Pencroft, examining the surface of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\n“Top smells some amphibious creature,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“An alligator, perhaps,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” replied Harding. “Alligators are only met with in\r\nregions less elevated in latitude.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Top had returned at his master’s call, and had regained the\r\nshore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in among the tall grass,\r\nand guided by instinct, he appeared to follow some invisible being which\r\nwas slipping along under the surface of the water. However the water\r\nwas calm; not a ripple disturbed its surface. Several times the settlers\r\nstopped on the bank, and observed it attentively. Nothing appeared.\r\nThere was some mystery there.\r\n\r\nThe engineer was puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Let us pursue this exploration to the end,” said he.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle of the\r\nlake, on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of the banks of\r\nthe lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer had not been able\r\nto discover how and where the waters were discharged. “There is no doubt\r\nthis overflow exists,” he repeated, “and since it is not visible it must\r\ngo through the granite cliff at the west!”\r\n\r\n“But what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear Cyrus?”\r\n asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Considerable importance,” replied the engineer; “for if it flows\r\nthrough the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it would be easy\r\nto render habitable after turning away the water.”\r\n\r\n“But is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at the\r\nbottom of the lake,” said Herbert, “and that it reaches the sea by some\r\nsubterranean passage?”\r\n\r\n“That might be,” replied the engineer, “and should it be so we shall be\r\nobliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not done it for\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to\r\nthe Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation. He barked with fury,\r\nand before his master could restrain him, he had plunged a second time\r\ninto the lake.\r\n\r\nAll ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty feet off,\r\nand Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head emerged from the\r\nwater, which did not appear to be deep in that place.\r\n\r\nHerbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which the\r\ntapering head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky mustaches,\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n“A lamantin!” he cried.\r\n\r\nIt was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of\r\ncetaceans, which bear the name of the “dugong,” for its nostrils were\r\nopen at the upper part of its snout. The enormous animal rushed on the\r\ndog, who tried to escape by returning towards the shore. His master\r\ncould do nothing to save him, and before Gideon Spilett or Herbert\r\nthought of bending their bows, Top, seized by the dugong, had\r\ndisappeared beneath the water.\r\n\r\nNeb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top’s help, and\r\nattack the dangerous animal in its own element.\r\n\r\n“No, Neb,” said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an inexplicable\r\nstruggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly resist; and\r\njudging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also a terrible\r\nstruggle, and could not but terminate in the death of the dog! But\r\nsuddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared. Thrown in\r\nthe air by some unknown power, he rose ten feet above the surface of the\r\nlake, fell again into the midst of the agitated waters, and then soon\r\ngained the shore, without any severe wounds, miraculously saved.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What was not\r\nless inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to be going on.\r\nDoubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful animal, after having\r\nreleased the dog, was fighting on its own account. But it did not last\r\nlong. The water became red with blood, and the body of the dugong,\r\nemerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around, soon stranded on\r\na little beach at the south angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards\r\nit. The dugong was dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen\r\nfeet long, and must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At\r\nits neck was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp\r\nblade.\r\n\r\nWhat could the amphibious creature have been, who, by this terrible\r\nblow had destroyed the formidable dugong? No one could tell, and much\r\ninterested in this incident, Harding and his companions returned to the\r\nChimneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 7th of May, Harding and Gideon Spilett, leaving Neb to\r\nprepare breakfast, climbed Prospect Heights, while Herbert and Pencroft\r\nascended by the river, to renew their store of wood.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on which the\r\ndugong had been stranded. Already flocks of birds had attacked the mass\r\nof flesh, and had to be driven away with stones, for Cyrus wished to\r\nkeep the fat for the use of the colony. As to the animal’s flesh\r\nit would furnish excellent food, for in the islands of the Malay\r\nArchipelago and elsewhere, it is especially reserved for the table of\r\nthe native princes. But that was Neb’s affair.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Cyrus Harding had other thoughts. He was much interested\r\nin the incident of the day before. He wished to penetrate the mystery\r\nof that submarine combat, and to ascertain what monster could have given\r\nthe dugong so strange a wound. He remained at the edge of the lake,\r\nlooking, observing; but nothing appeared under the tranquil waters,\r\nwhich sparkled in the first rays of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nAt the beach, on which lay the body of the dugong, the water was\r\ntolerably shallow, but from this point the bottom of the lake sloped\r\ngradually, and it was probable that the depth was considerable in the\r\ncenter. The lake might be considered as a large center basin, which was\r\nfilled by the water from the Red Creek.\r\n\r\n“Well, Cyrus,” said the reporter, “there seems to be nothing suspicious\r\nin this water.”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear Spilett,” replied the engineer, “and I really do not know\r\nhow to account for the incident of yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“I acknowledge,” returned Spilett, “that the wound given this creature\r\nis, at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either how Top was\r\nso vigorously cast up out of the water. One could have thought that a\r\npowerful arm hurled him up, and that the same arm with a dagger killed\r\nthe dugong!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the engineer, who had become thoughtful; “there is\r\nsomething there that I cannot understand. But do you better understand\r\neither, my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved myself--how I was drawn\r\nfrom the waves, and carried to the downs? No! Is it not true? Now, I\r\nfeel sure that there is some mystery there, which, doubtless, we shall\r\ndiscover some day. Let us observe, but do not dwell on these singular\r\nincidents before our companions. Let us keep our remarks to ourselves,\r\nand continue our work.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the engineer had not as yet been able to\r\ndiscover the place where the surplus water escaped, but he knew it must\r\nexist somewhere. He was much surprised to see a strong current at this\r\nplace. By throwing in some bits of wood he found that it set towards the\r\nsouthern angle. He followed the current, and arrived at the south point\r\nof the lake.\r\n\r\nThere was there a sort of depression in the water, as if it was suddenly\r\nlost in some fissure in the ground.\r\n\r\nHarding listened; placing his ear to the level of the lake, he very\r\ndistinctly heard the noise of a subterranean fall.\r\n\r\n“There,” said he, rising, “is the discharge of the water; there,\r\ndoubtless, by a passage in the granite cliff, it joins the sea, through\r\ncavities which we can use to our profit. Well, I can find it!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer cut a long branch, stripped it of its leaves, and plunging\r\nit into the angle between the two banks, he found that there was a large\r\nhole one foot only beneath the surface of the water. This hole was the\r\nopening so long looked for in vain, and the force of the current was\r\nsuch that the branch was torn from the engineer’s hands and disappeared.\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt about it now,” repeated Harding. “There is the\r\noutlet, and I will lay it open to view!”\r\n\r\n“How?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“By lowering the level of the water of the lake three feet.”\r\n\r\n“And how will you lower the level?”\r\n\r\n“By opening another outlet larger than this.”\r\n\r\n“At what place, Cyrus?”\r\n\r\n“At the part of the bank nearest the coast.”\r\n\r\n“But it is a mass of granite!” observed Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Cyrus Harding, “I will blow up the granite, and the\r\nwater escaping, will subside, so as to lay bare this opening--”\r\n\r\n“And make a waterfall, by falling on to the beach,” added the reporter.\r\n\r\n“A fall that we shall make use of!” replied Cyrus. “Come, come!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer hurried away his companion, whose confidence in Harding was\r\nsuch that he did not doubt the enterprise would succeed. And yet, how\r\nwas this granite wall to be opened without powder, and with imperfect\r\ninstruments? Was not this work upon which the engineer was so bent above\r\ntheir strength?\r\n\r\nWhen Harding and the reporter entered the Chimneys, they found Herbert\r\nand Pencroft unloading their raft of wood.\r\n\r\n“The woodmen have just finished, captain.” said the sailor, laughing,\r\n“and when you want masons--”\r\n\r\n“Masons,--no, but chemists,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added the reporter, “we are going to blow up the island--”\r\n\r\n“Blow up the island?” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Part of it, at least,” replied Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, my friends,” said the engineer. And he made known to them\r\nthe result of his observations.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, a cavity, more or less considerable, must exist in\r\nthe mass of granite which supported Prospect Heights, and he intended\r\nto penetrate into it. To do this, the opening through which the water\r\nrushed must first be cleared, and the level lowered by making a larger\r\noutlet. Therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured, which\r\nwould make a deep trench in some other part of the shore. This was what\r\nHarding was going to attempt with the minerals which nature placed at\r\nhis disposal.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to say with what enthusiasm all, especially Pencroft,\r\nreceived this project. To employ great means, open the granite, create a\r\ncascade, that suited the sailor. And he would just as soon be a chemist\r\nas a mason or bootmaker, since the engineer wanted chemicals. He would\r\nbe all that they liked, “even a professor of dancing and deportment,”\r\n said he to Neb, if that was ever necessary.\r\n\r\nNeb and Pencroft were first of all told to extract the grease from the\r\ndugong, and to keep the flesh, which was destined for food. Such perfect\r\nconfidence had they in the engineer, that they set out directly,\r\nwithout even asking a question. A few minutes after them, Cyrus Harding,\r\nHerbert, and Gideon Spilett, dragging the hurdle, went towards the vein\r\nof coals, where those shistose pyrites abound which are met with in the\r\nmost recent transition soil, and of which Harding had already found a\r\nspecimen. All the day being employed in carrying a quantity of these\r\nstones to the Chimneys, by evening they had several tons.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations.\r\nThese shistose pyrites being composed principally of coal, flint,\r\nalumina, and sulphuret of iron--the latter in excess--it was necessary\r\nto separate the sulphuret of iron, and transform it into sulphate as\r\nrapidly as possible. The sulphate obtained, the sulphuric acid could\r\nthen be extracted.\r\n\r\nThis was the object to be attained. Sulphuric acid is one of the agents\r\nthe most frequently employed, and the manufacturing importance of a\r\nnation can be measured by the consumption which is made of it. This acid\r\nwould later be of great use to the settlers, in the manufacturing of\r\ncandles, tanning skins, etc., but this time the engineer reserved it for\r\nanother use.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding chose, behind the Chimneys, a site where the ground\r\nwas perfectly level. On this ground he placed a layer of branches and\r\nchopped wood, on which were piled some pieces of shistose pyrites,\r\nbuttressed one against the other, the whole being covered with a thin\r\nlayer of pyrites, previously reduced to the size of a nut.\r\n\r\nThis done, they set fire to the wood, the heat was communicated to the\r\nshist, which soon kindled, since it contains coal and sulphur. Then new\r\nlayers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense\r\nheap, the exterior of which was covered with earth and grass, several\r\nair-holes being left, as if it was a stack of wood which was to be\r\ncarbonized to make charcoal.\r\n\r\nThey then left the transformation to complete itself, and it would\r\nnot take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be\r\nchanged to sulphate of iron and the alumina into sulphate of alumina,\r\ntwo equally soluble substances, the others, flint, burnt coal, and\r\ncinders, not being so.\r\n\r\nWhile this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded with\r\nother operations, which were pursued with more than zeal,--it was\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\nNeb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and placed it\r\nin large earthen pots. It was then necessary to separate the glycerine\r\nfrom the fat by saponifying it. Now, to obtain this result, it had to\r\nbe treated either with soda or lime. In fact, one or other of these\r\nsubstances, after having attacked the fat, would form a soap by\r\nseparating the glycerine, and it was just this glycerine which the\r\nengineer wished to obtain. There was no want of lime, only treatment by\r\nlime would give calcareous soap, insoluble, and consequently useless,\r\nwhile treatment by soda would furnish, on the contrary, a soluble soap,\r\nwhich could be put to domestic use. Now, a practical man, like Cyrus\r\nHarding, would rather try to obtain soda. Was this difficult? No; for\r\nmarine plants abounded on the shore, glass-wort, ficoides, and all\r\nthose fucaceae which form wrack. A large quantity of these plants\r\nwas collected, first dried, then burnt in holes in the open air. The\r\ncombustion of these plants was kept up for several days, and the result\r\nwas a compact gray mass, which has been long known under the name of\r\n“natural soda.”\r\n\r\nThis obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which gave both a\r\nsoluble soap and that neutral substance, glycerine.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his future\r\npreparation, another substance, nitrate of potash, which is better known\r\nunder the name of salt niter, or of saltpeter.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating the\r\ncarbonate of potash, which would be easily extracted from the cinders of\r\nthe vegetables, by azotic acid. But this acid was wanting, and he would\r\nhave been in some difficulty, if nature had not happily furnished the\r\nsaltpeter, without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it\r\nup. Herbert found a vein of it at the foot of Mount Franklin, and they\r\nhad nothing to do but purify this salt.\r\n\r\nThese different works lasted a week. They were finished before\r\nthe transformation of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been\r\naccomplished. During the following days the settlers had time to\r\nconstruct a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement, to serve for\r\nthe distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been obtained. All\r\nthis was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at the time when the\r\nchemical transformation terminated. Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and\r\nPencroft, skillfully directed by the engineer, had become most clever\r\nworkmen. Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and\r\nwho teaches the best.\r\n\r\nWhen the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the result\r\nof the operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate of alumina,\r\nflint, remains of coal, and cinders was placed in a basinful of water.\r\nThey stirred this mixture, let it settle, then decanted it, and obtained\r\na clear liquid containing in solution sulphate of iron and sulphate of\r\nalumina, the other matters remaining solid, since they are insoluble.\r\nLastly, this liquid being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate of\r\niron were deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the\r\nsulphate of alumina, was thrown away.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these sulphate\r\nof iron crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be extracted. The\r\nmaking of sulphuric acid is a very expensive manufacture. Considerable\r\nworks are necessary--a special set of tools, an apparatus of\r\nplatina, leaden chambers, unassailable by the acid, and in which the\r\ntransformation is performed, etc. The engineer had none of these at his\r\ndisposal, but he knew that, in Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is\r\nmanufactured by very simple means, which have also the advantage of\r\nproducing it to a superior degree of concentration. It is thus that the\r\nacid known under the name of Nordhausen acid is made.\r\n\r\nTo obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation to make,\r\nto calcine the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase, so that the\r\nsulphuric acid should distil in vapor, which vapor, by condensation,\r\nwould produce the acid.\r\n\r\nThe crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace would\r\ndistil the sulphuric acid. The operation was successfully completed, and\r\non the 20th of May, twelve days after commencing it, the engineer\r\nwas the possessor of the agent which later he hoped to use in so many\r\ndifferent ways.\r\n\r\nNow, why did he wish for this agent? Simply to produce azotic acid;\r\nand that was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric acid, gives\r\nazotic, or nitric, acid by distillation.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid? His\r\ncompanions were still ignorant of this, for he had not informed them of\r\nthe result at which he aimed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and by a\r\nlast operation he would procure the substance which had given so much\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nTaking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had been\r\npreviously concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the water-bath, and\r\nhe obtained, without even employing a refrigerant mixture, several pints\r\nof an oily yellow mixture.\r\n\r\nThis last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired place, at\r\na distance from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of an explosion,\r\nand when he showed a bottle of this liquid to his friends, he contented\r\nhimself with saying,--\r\n\r\n“Here is nitro-glycerine!”\r\n\r\nIt was really this terrible production, of which the explosive power is\r\nperhaps tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has already caused so\r\nmany accidents. However, since a way has been found to transform it into\r\ndynamite, that is to say, to mix with it some solid substance, clay or\r\nsugar, porous enough to hold it, the dangerous liquid has been used\r\nwith some security. But dynamite was not yet known at the time when the\r\nsettlers worked on Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n“And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?” said\r\nPencroft incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend,” replied the engineer, “and this nitro-glycerine will\r\nproduce so much the more effect, as the granite is extremely hard, and\r\nwill oppose a greater resistance to the explosion.”\r\n\r\n“And when shall we see this, captain?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, as soon as we have dug a hole for the mine, replied the\r\nengineer.”\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners went to the point\r\nwhich formed the eastern shore of Lake Grant, and was only five hundred\r\nfeet from the coast. At this place, the plateau inclined downwards from\r\nthe waters, which were only restrained by their granite case. Therefore,\r\nif this case was broken, the water would escape by the opening and form\r\na stream, which, flowing over the inclined surface of the plateau,\r\nwould rush on to the beach. Consequently, the level of the lake would\r\nbe greatly lowered, and the opening where the water escaped would be\r\nexposed, which was their final aim.\r\n\r\nUnder the engineer’s directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe, which\r\nhe handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite. The hole was\r\nmade on the point of the shore, slanting, so that it should meet a\r\nmuch lower level than that of the water of the lake. In this way the\r\nexplosive force, by scattering the rock, would open a large place for\r\nthe water to rush out.\r\n\r\nThe work took some time, for the engineer, wishing to produce a great\r\neffect, intended to devote not less than seven quarts of nitro-glycerine\r\nto the operation. But Pencroft, relieved by Neb, did so well, that\r\ntowards four o’clock in the evening, the mine was finished.\r\n\r\nNow the question of setting fire to the explosive substance was raised.\r\nGenerally, nitro-glycerine is ignited by caps of fulminate, which in\r\nbursting cause the explosion. A shock is therefore needed to produce\r\nthe explosion, for, simply lighted, this substance would burn without\r\nexploding.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding could certainly have fabricated a percussion cap. In\r\ndefault of fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance similar to\r\nguncotton, since he had azotic acid at his disposal. This substance,\r\npressed in a cartridge, and introduced among the nitro-glycerine, would\r\nburst by means of a fuse, and cause the explosion.\r\n\r\nBut Cyrus Harding knew that nitro-glycerine would explode by a shock.\r\nHe resolved to employ this means, and try another way, if this did not\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the blow of a hammer on a few drops of nitro-glycerine, spread\r\nout on a hard surface, was enough to create an explosion. But the\r\noperator could not be there to give the blow, without becoming a victim\r\nto the operation. Harding, therefore, thought of suspending a mass of\r\niron, weighing several pounds, by means of a fiber, to an upright just\r\nabove the mine. Another long fiber, previously impregnated with sulphur,\r\nwas attached to the middle of the first, by one end, while the other lay\r\non the ground several feet distant from the mine. The second fiber being\r\nset on fire, it would burn till it reached the first. This catching\r\nfire in its turn, would break, and the mass of iron would fall on the\r\nnitro-glycerine. This apparatus being then arranged, the engineer, after\r\nhaving sent his companions to a distance, filled the hole, so that the\r\nnitro-glycerine was on a level with the opening; then he threw a few\r\ndrops of it on the surface of the rock, above which the mass of iron was\r\nalready suspended.\r\n\r\nThis done, Harding lit the end of the sulphured fiber, and leaving the\r\nplace, he returned with his companions to the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe fiber was intended to burn five and twenty minutes, and, in fact,\r\nfive and twenty minutes afterwards a most tremendous explosion was\r\nheard. The island appeared to tremble to its very foundation. Stones\r\nwere projected in the air as if by the eruption of a volcano. The shock\r\nproduced by the displacing of the air was such, that the rocks of the\r\nChimneys shook. The settlers, although they were more than two miles\r\nfrom the mine, were thrown on the ground.\r\n\r\nThey rose, climbed the plateau, and ran towards the place where the bank\r\nof the lake must have been shattered by the explosion.\r\n\r\nA cheer escaped them! A large rent was seen in the granite! A rapid\r\nstream of water rushed foaming across the plateau and dashed down a\r\nheight of three hundred feet on to the beach!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding’s project had succeeded, but, according to his usual\r\nhabit he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed look, he\r\nremained motionless. Herbert was in ecstasies, Neb bounded with joy,\r\nPencroft nodded his great head, murmuring these words,--\r\n\r\n“Come, our engineer gets on capitally!”\r\n\r\nThe nitro-glycerine had indeed acted powerfully. The opening which it\r\nhad made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through\r\nthis new outlet was at least treble that which before passed through the\r\nold one. The result was, that a short time after the operation the level\r\nof the lake would be lowered two feet, or more.\r\n\r\nThe settlers went to the Chimneys to take some pickaxes, iron-tipped\r\nspears, string made of fibers, flint and steel; they then returned to\r\nthe plateau, Top accompanying them.\r\n\r\nOn the way the sailor could not help saying to the engineer,--\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think, captain, that by means of that charming liquid you\r\nhave made, one could blow up the whole of our island?”\r\n\r\n“Without any doubt, the island, continents, and the world itself,”\r\n replied the engineer. “It is only a question of quantity.”\r\n\r\n“Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading firearms?”\r\n asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would be easy\r\nto make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have azotic acid,\r\nsaltpeter, sulphur, and coal. Unhappily, it is the guns which we have\r\nnot got.\r\n\r\n“Oh, captain,” replied the sailor, “with a little determination--”\r\n\r\nPencroft had erased the word “impossible” from the dictionary of Lincoln\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went immediately\r\ntowards that point of the lake near which was the old opening now\r\nuncovered. This outlet had now become practicable, since the water no\r\nlonger rushed through it, and it would doubtless be easy to explore the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake,\r\nand a glance showed them that the object had been attained.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of the\r\nwater, appeared the long-looked-for opening. A narrow ridge, left bare\r\nby the retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it. This orifice\r\nwas nearly twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in height. It was like\r\nthe mouth of a drain at the edge of the pavement, and therefore did\r\nnot offer an easy passage to the settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking\r\ntheir pickaxes, soon made it of a suitable height.\r\n\r\nThe engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the opening,\r\nin its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than from thirty to\r\nthirty-five degrees. It was therefore practicable, and, provided that\r\nthe declivity did not increase, it would be easy to descend even to the\r\nlevel of the sea. If then, as was probable, some vast cavity existed in\r\nthe interior of the granite, it might, perhaps, be of great use.\r\n\r\n“Well, captain, what are we stopping for?” asked the sailor, impatient\r\nto enter the narrow passage. “You see Top has got before us!”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied the engineer. “But we must see our way. Neb, go and\r\ncut some resinous branches.”\r\n\r\nNeb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines and other\r\ngreen trees, and soon returned with some branches, which they made\r\ninto torches. The torches were lighted with flint and steel, and Cyrus\r\nHarding leading, the settlers ventured into the dark passage, which the\r\noverplus of the lake had formerly filled.\r\n\r\nContrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the passage\r\nincreased as the explorers proceeded, so that they very soon were able\r\nto stand upright. The granite, worn by the water for an infinite time,\r\nwas very slippery, and falls were to be dreaded. But the settlers were\r\nall attached to each other by a cord, as is frequently done in ascending\r\nmountains. Happily some projections of the granite, forming regular\r\nsteps, made the descent less perilous. Drops, still hanging from the\r\nrocks, shone here and there under the light of the torches, and\r\nthe explorers guessed that the sides were clothed with innumerable\r\nstalactites. The engineer examined this black granite. There was not a\r\nstratum, not a break in it. The mass was compact, and of an extremely\r\nclose grain. The passage dated, then, from the very origin of the\r\nisland. It was not the water which little by little had hollowed it.\r\nPluto and not Neptune had bored it with his own hand, and on the wall\r\ntraces of an eruptive work could be distinguished, which all the washing\r\nof the water had not been able totally to efface.\r\n\r\nThe settlers descended very slowly. They could not but feel a certain\r\nawe, in this venturing into these unknown depths, for the first time\r\nvisited by human beings. They did not speak, but they thought; and\r\nthe thought came to more than one, that some polypus or other\r\ngigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities, which were in\r\ncommunication with the sea. However, Top kept at the head of the little\r\nband, and they could rely on the sagacity of the dog, who would not fail\r\nto give the alarm if there was any need for it.\r\n\r\nAfter having descended about a hundred feet, following a winding road,\r\nHarding who was walking on before, stopped, and his companions came up\r\nwith him. The place where they had halted was wider, so as to form a\r\ncavern of moderate dimensions. Drops of water fell from the vault, but\r\nthat did not prove that they oozed through the rock. They were simply\r\nthe last traces left by the torrent which had so long thundered through\r\nthis cavity, and the air there was pure though slightly damp, but\r\nproducing no mephitic exhalation.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear Cyrus,” said Gideon Spilett, “here is a very secure\r\nretreat, well hid in the depths of the rock, but it is, however,\r\nuninhabitable.”\r\n\r\n“Why uninhabitable?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Because it is too small and too dark.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light\r\nand air?” replied Pencroft, who now thought nothing impossible.\r\n\r\n“Let us go on with our exploration,” said Cyrus Harding. “Perhaps lower\r\ndown, nature will have spared us this labor.”\r\n\r\n“We have only gone a third of the way,” observed Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Nearly a third,” replied Harding, “for we have descended a hundred feet\r\nfrom the opening, and it is not impossible that a hundred feet farther\r\ndown--”\r\n\r\n“Where is Top?” asked Neb, interrupting his master.\r\n\r\nThey searched the cavern, but the dog was not there.\r\n\r\n“Most likely he has gone on,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Let us join him,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\nThe descent was continued. The engineer carefully observed all the\r\ndeviations of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours, he\r\ncould easily have given an account of its general direction, which went\r\ntowards the sea.\r\n\r\nThe settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their attention was\r\nattracted by distant sounds which came up from the depths. They stopped\r\nand listened. These sounds, carried through the passage as through an\r\nacoustic tube, came clearly to the ear.\r\n\r\n“That is Top barking!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “and our brave dog is barking furiously!”\r\n\r\n“We have our iron-tipped spears,” said Cyrus Harding. “Keep on your\r\nguard, and forward!”\r\n\r\n“It is becoming more and more interesting,” murmured Gideon Spilett in\r\nthe sailor’s ear, who nodded. Harding and his companions rushed to the\r\nhelp of their dog. Top’s barking became more and more perceptible,\r\nand it seemed strangely fierce. Was he engaged in a struggle with some\r\nanimal whose retreat he had disturbed? Without thinking of the danger\r\nto which they might be exposed, the explorers were now impelled by an\r\nirresistible curiosity, and in a few minutes, sixteen feet lower they\r\nrejoined Top.\r\n\r\nThere the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern.\r\n\r\nTop was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously. Pencroft and\r\nNeb, waving their torches, threw the light into every crevice; and\r\nat the same time, Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, their spears\r\nraised, were ready for any emergency which might arise. The enormous\r\ncavern was empty. The settlers explored it in every direction. There was\r\nnothing there, not an animal, not a human being; and yet Top continued\r\nto bark. Neither caresses nor threats could make him be silent.\r\n\r\n“There must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the lake\r\nreached the sea,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” replied Pencroft, “and we must take care not to tumble into\r\na hole.”\r\n\r\n“Go, Top, go!” cried Harding.\r\n\r\nThe dog, excited by his master’s words, ran towards the extremity of the\r\ncavern, and there redoubled his barking.\r\n\r\nThey followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived the mouth\r\nof a regular well in the granite. It was by this that the water escaped;\r\nand this time it was not an oblique and practicable passage, but a\r\nperpendicular well, into which it was impossible to venture.\r\n\r\nThe torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen. Harding\r\ntook a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss. The blazing resin,\r\nwhose illuminating power increased still more by the rapidity of its\r\nfall, lighted up the interior of the well, but yet nothing appeared. The\r\nflame then went out with a slight hiss, which showed that it had reached\r\nthe water, that is to say, the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was able to\r\ncalculate the depth of the well, which was found to be about ninety\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\n“Here is our dwelling,” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“But it was occupied by some creature,” replied Gideon Spilett, whose\r\ncuriosity was not yet satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Well, the creature, amphibious or otherwise, has made off through this\r\nopening,” replied the engineer, “and has left the place for us.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” added the sailor, “I should like very much to be Top just\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, for he doesn’t bark for nothing!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding looked at his dog, and those of his companions who were\r\nnear him might have heard him murmur these words,--\r\n\r\n“Yes, I believe that Top knows more than we do about a great many\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nHowever, the wishes of the settlers were for the most part satisfied.\r\nChance, aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader, had done them\r\ngreat service. They had now at their disposal a vast cavern, the size\r\nof which could not be properly calculated by the feeble light of their\r\ntorches, but it would certainly be easy to divide it into rooms, by\r\nmeans of brick partitions, or to use it, if not as a house, at least as\r\na spacious apartment. The water which had left it could not return. The\r\nplace was free.\r\n\r\nTwo difficulties remained; firstly, the possibility of lighting this\r\nexcavation in the midst of solid rock; secondly, the necessity of\r\nrendering the means of access more easy. It was useless to think of\r\nlighting it from above, because of the enormous thickness of the granite\r\nwhich composed the ceiling; but perhaps the outer wall next the sea\r\nmight be pierced. Cyrus Harding, during the descent, had roughly\r\ncalculated its obliqueness, and consequently the length of the passage,\r\nand was therefore led to believe that the outer wall could not be very\r\nthick. If light was thus obtained, so would a means of access, for\r\nit would be as easy to pierce a door as windows, and to establish an\r\nexterior ladder.\r\n\r\nHarding made known his ideas to his companions.\r\n\r\n“Then, captain, let us set to work!” replied Pencroft. “I have my\r\npickaxe, and I shall soon make my way through this wall. Where shall I\r\nstrike?”\r\n\r\n“Here,” replied the engineer, showing the sturdy sailor a considerable\r\nrecess in the side, which would much diminish the thickness.\r\n\r\nPencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of the\r\ntorches, he made the splinters fly around him. Neb relieved him, then\r\nSpilett took Neb’s place.\r\n\r\nThis work had lasted two hours, and they began to fear that at this spot\r\nthe wall would not yield to the pickaxe, when at a last blow given by\r\nGideon Spilett, the instrument, passing through the rock, fell outside.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! hurrah!” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\nThe wall only measured there three feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nHarding applied his eye to the aperture, which overlooked the ground\r\nfrom a height of eighty feet. Before him was extended the sea-coast, the\r\nislet, and beyond the open sea.\r\n\r\nFloods of light entered by this hole, inundating the splendid cavern and\r\nproducing a magic effect! On its left side it did not measure more than\r\nthirty feet in height and breadth, but on the right it was enormous, and\r\nits vaulted roof rose to a height of more than eighty feet.\r\n\r\nIn some places granite pillars, irregularly disposed, supported the\r\nvaulted roof, as those in the nave of a cathedral, here forming lateral\r\npiers, there elliptical arches, adorned with pointed moldings, losing\r\nthemselves in dark bays, amid the fantastic arches of which glimpses\r\ncould be caught in the shade, covered with a profusion of projections\r\nformed like so many pendants. This cavern was a picturesque mixture of\r\nall the styles of Byzantine, Roman, or Gothic architecture ever produced\r\nby the hand of man. And yet this was only the work of nature. She alone\r\nhad hollowed this fairy Alhambra in a mass of granite.\r\n\r\nThe settlers were overwhelmed with admiration. Where they had only\r\nexpected to find a narrow cavity, they had found a sort of marvelous\r\npalace, and Neb had taken off his hat, as if he had been transported\r\ninto a temple!\r\n\r\nCries of admiration issued from every mouth. Hurrahs resounded, and the\r\necho was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my friends!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding, “when we have lighted the\r\ninterior of this place, and have arranged our rooms and storehouses in\r\nthe left part, we shall still have this splendid cavern, which we will\r\nmake our study and our museum!”\r\n\r\n“And we will call it?--” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Granite House,” replied Harding; a name which his companions again\r\nsaluted with a cheer.\r\n\r\nThe torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged to return\r\nby the passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was decided to put\r\noff the work necessary for the arrangement of their new dwelling till\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nBefore departing, Cyrus Harding leaned once more over the dark well,\r\nwhich descended perpendicularly to the level of the sea. He listened\r\nattentively. No noise was heard, not even that of the water, which the\r\nundulations of the surge must sometimes agitate in its depths. A flaming\r\nbranch was again thrown in. The sides of the well were lighted up for an\r\ninstant, but as at the first time, nothing suspicious was seen.\r\n\r\nIf some marine monster had been surprised unawares by the retreat of the\r\nwater, he would by this time have regained the sea by the subterranean\r\npassage, before the new opening had been offered to him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the engineer was standing motionless, his eyes fixed on the\r\ngulf, without uttering a word.\r\n\r\nThe sailor approached him, and touching his arm, “Captain!” said he.\r\n\r\n“What do you want, my friend?” asked the engineer, as if he had returned\r\nfrom the land of dreams.\r\n\r\n“The torches will soon go out.”\r\n\r\n“Forward!” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nThe little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark\r\npassage. Top closed the rear, still growling every now and then. The\r\nascent was painful enough. The settlers rested a few minutes in the\r\nupper grotto, which made a sort of landing-place halfway up the long\r\ngranite staircase. Then they began to climb again.\r\n\r\nSoon fresher air was felt. The drops of water, dried by evaporation, no\r\nlonger sparkled on the walls. The flaring torches began to grow dim. The\r\none which Neb carried went out, and if they did not wish to find their\r\nway in the dark, they must hasten.\r\n\r\nThis was done, and a little before four o’clock, at the moment when the\r\nsailor’s torch went out in its turn, Cyrus Harding and his companions\r\npassed out of the passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 22nd of May, the arrangement of their new dwelling\r\nwas commenced. In fact, the settlers longed to exchange the insufficient\r\nshelter of the Chimneys for this large and healthy retreat, in the midst\r\nof solid rock, and sheltered from the water both of the sea and sky.\r\nTheir former dwelling was not, however, to be entirely abandoned, for\r\nthe engineer intended to make a manufactory of it for important works.\r\nCyrus Harding’s first care was to find out the position of the front of\r\nGranite House from the outside. He went to the beach, and as the\r\npickaxe when it escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen\r\nperpendicularly to the foot of the cliff, the finding it would be\r\nsufficient to show the place where the hole had been pierced in the\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nThe pickaxe was easily found, and the hole could be seen in a\r\nperpendicular line above the spot where it was stuck in the sand. Some\r\nrock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow opening; they\r\nevidently thought that Granite House had been discovered on purpose for\r\nthem. It was the engineer’s intention to divide the right portion of the\r\ncavern into several rooms, preceded by an entrance passage, and to light\r\nit by means of five windows and a door, pierced in the front. Pencroft\r\nwas much pleased with the five windows, but he could not understand the\r\nuse of the door, since the passage offered a natural staircase, through\r\nwhich it would always be easy to enter Granite House.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” replied Harding, “if it is easy for us to reach our\r\ndwelling by this passage, it will be equally easy for others besides\r\nus. I mean, on the contrary, to block up that opening, to seal it\r\nhermetically, and, if it is necessary, to completely hide the entrance\r\nby making a dam, and thus causing the water of the lake to rise.”\r\n\r\n“And how shall we get in?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“By an outside ladder,” replied Cyrus Harding, “a rope ladder, which,\r\nonce drawn up, will render access to our dwelling impossible.”\r\n\r\n“But why so many precautions?” asked Pencroft. “As yet we have seen no\r\ndangerous animals. As to our island being inhabited by natives, I don’t\r\nbelieve it!”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure of that, Pencroft?” asked the engineer, looking at\r\nthe sailor.\r\n\r\n“Of course we shall not be quite sure, till we have explored it in every\r\ndirection,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Harding, “for we know only a small portion of it as yet. But\r\nat any rate, if we have no enemies in the interior, they may come from\r\nthe exterior, for parts of the Pacific are very dangerous. We must be\r\nprovided against every contingency.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding spoke wisely; and without making any further objection,\r\nPencroft prepared to execute his orders.\r\n\r\nThe front of Granite House was then to be lighted by five windows and a\r\ndoor, besides a large bay window and some smaller oval ones, which would\r\nadmit plenty of light to enter into the marvelous nave which was to be\r\ntheir chief room. This facade, situated at a height of eighty feet above\r\nthe ground, was exposed to the east, and the rising sun saluted it with\r\nits first rays. It was found to be just at that part of the cliff which\r\nwas between the projection at the mouth of the Mercy and a perpendicular\r\nline traced above the heap of rocks which formed the Chimneys. Thus\r\nthe winds from the northeast would only strike it obliquely, for it was\r\nprotected by the projection. Besides, until the window-frames were made,\r\nthe engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters, which\r\nwould prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which could be\r\nconcealed in need.\r\n\r\nThe first work was to make the openings. This would have taken too long\r\nwith the pickaxe alone, and it is known that Harding was an ingenious\r\nman. He had still a quantity of nitro-glycerine at his disposal, and he\r\nemployed it usefully. By means of this explosive substance the rock was\r\nbroken open at the very places chosen by the engineer. Then, with the\r\npickaxe and spade, the windows and doors were properly shaped, the\r\njagged edges were smoothed off, and a few days after the beginning of\r\nthe work, Granite House was abundantly lighted by the rising sun,\r\nwhose rays penetrated into its most secret recesses. Following the\r\nplan proposed by Cyrus Harding, the space was to be divided into five\r\ncompartments looking out on the sea; to the right, an entry with a\r\ndoor, which would meet the ladder; then a kitchen, thirty feet long; a\r\ndining-room, measuring forty feet; a sleeping-room, of equal size; and\r\nlastly, a “Visitor’s room,” petitioned for by Pencroft, and which was\r\nnext to the great hall. These rooms, or rather this suite of rooms,\r\nwould not occupy all the depth of the cave. There would be also a\r\ncorridor and a storehouse, in which their tools, provisions, and stores\r\nwould be kept. All the productions of the island, the flora as well as\r\nthe fauna, were to be there in the best possible state of preservation,\r\nand completely sheltered from the damp. There was no want of space, so\r\nthat each object could be methodically arranged. Besides, the colonists\r\nhad still at their disposal the little grotto above the great cavern,\r\nwhich was like the garret of the new dwelling.\r\n\r\nThis plan settled, it had only to be put into execution. The miners\r\nbecame brickmakers again, then the bricks were brought to the foot of\r\nGranite House. Till then, Harding and his companions had only entered\r\nthe cavern by the long passage. This mode of communication obliged them\r\nfirst to climb Prospect Heights, making a detour by the river’s bank,\r\nand then to descend two hundred feet through the passage, having to\r\nclimb as far when they wished to return to the plateau. This was a great\r\nloss of time, and was also very fatiguing. Cyrus Harding, therefore,\r\nresolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of\r\na strong rope ladder, which, once raised, would render Granite House\r\ncompletely inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThis ladder was manufactured with extreme care, and its uprights, formed\r\nof the twisted fibers of a species of cane, had the strength of a thick\r\ncable. As to the rounds, they were made of a sort of red cedar, with\r\nlight, strong branches; and this apparatus was wrought by the masterly\r\nhand of Pencroft.\r\n\r\nOther ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane with a\r\ntackle was fixed at the door. In this way bricks could easily be\r\nraised into Granite House. The transport of the materials being thus\r\nsimplified, the arrangement of the interior could begin immediately.\r\nThere was no want of lime, and some thousands of bricks were there\r\nready to be used. The framework of the partitions was soon raised, very\r\nroughly at first, and in a short time, the cave was divided into rooms\r\nand storehouses, according to the plan agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThese different works progressed rapidly under the direction of the\r\nengineer, who himself handled the hammer and the trowel. No labor came\r\namiss to Cyrus Harding, who thus set an example to his intelligent and\r\nzealous companions. They worked with confidence, even gaily, Pencroft\r\nalways having some joke to crack, sometimes carpenter, sometimes\r\nrope-maker, sometimes mason, while he communicated his good humor to\r\nall the members of their little world. His faith in the engineer\r\nwas complete; nothing could disturb it. He believed him capable of\r\nundertaking anything and succeeding in everything. The question of boots\r\nand clothes--assuredly a serious question,--that of light during the\r\nwinter months, utilizing the fertile parts of the island, transforming\r\nthe wild flora into cultivated flora, it all appeared easy to him; Cyrus\r\nHarding helping, everything would be done in time. He dreamed of canals\r\nfacilitating the transport of the riches of the ground; workings\r\nof quarries and mines; machines for every industrial manufacture;\r\nrailroads; yes, railroads! of which a network would certainly one day\r\ncover Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nThe engineer let Pencroft talk. He did not put down the aspirations of\r\nthis brave heart. He knew how communicable confidence is; he even smiled\r\nto hear him speak, and said nothing of the uneasiness for the future\r\nwhich he felt. In fact, in that part of the Pacific, out of the course\r\nof vessels, it was to be feared that no help would ever come to them. It\r\nwas on themselves, on themselves alone, that the settlers must depend,\r\nfor the distance of Lincoln Island from all other land was such, that\r\nto hazard themselves in a boat, of a necessarily inferior construction,\r\nwould be a serious and perilous thing.\r\n\r\n“But,” as the sailor said, “they quite took the wind out of the sails of\r\nthe Robinsons, for whom everything was done by a miracle.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, they were energetic; an energetic man will succeed where an\r\nindolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish.\r\n\r\nHerbert distinguished himself in these works. He was intelligent and\r\nactive; understanding quickly, he performed well; and Cyrus Harding\r\nbecame more and more attached to the boy. Herbert had a lively and\r\nreverent love for the engineer. Pencroft saw the close sympathy which\r\nexisted between the two, but he was not in the least jealous. Neb\r\nwas Neb: he was what he would be always, courage, zeal, devotion,\r\nself-denial personified. He had the same faith in his master that\r\nPencroft had, but he showed it less vehemently. When the sailor was\r\nenthusiastic, Neb always looked as if he would say, “Nothing could be\r\nmore natural.” Pencroft and he were great friends.\r\n\r\nAs to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work, and was not less\r\nskilful in it than his companions, which always rather astonished\r\nthe sailor. A “journalist,” clever, not only in understanding, but in\r\nperforming everything.\r\n\r\nThe ladder was finally fixed on the 28th of May. There were not less\r\nthan a hundred rounds in this perpendicular height of eighty feet.\r\nHarding had been able, fortunately, to divide it in two parts, profiting\r\nby an overhanging of the cliff which made a projection forty feet above\r\nthe ground. This projection, carefully leveled by the pickaxe, made a\r\nsort of platform, to which they fixed the first ladder, of which the\r\noscillation was thus diminished one-half, and a rope permitted it to be\r\nraised to the level of Granite House. As to the second ladder, it was\r\nsecured both at its lower part, which rested on the projection, and at\r\nits upper end, which was fastened to the door. In short the ascent had\r\nbeen made much easier. Besides, Cyrus Harding hoped later to establish\r\nan hydraulic apparatus, which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time,\r\nfor the inhabitants of Granite House.\r\n\r\nThe settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder. They were\r\nlight and active, and Pencroft, as a sailor, accustomed to run up\r\nthe masts and shrouds, was able to give them lessons. But it was also\r\nnecessary to give them to Top. The poor dog, with his four paws, was\r\nnot formed for this sort of exercise. But Pencroft was such a zealous\r\nmaster, that Top ended by properly performing his ascents, and soon\r\nmounted the ladder as readily as his brethren in the circus. It need not\r\nbe said that the sailor was proud of his pupil. However, more than once\r\nPencroft hoisted him on his back, which Top never complained of.\r\n\r\nIt must be mentioned here, that during these works, which were actively\r\nconducted, for the bad season was approaching, the alimentary question\r\nwas not neglected. Every day, the reporter and Herbert, who had been\r\nvoted purveyors to the colony, devoted some hours to the chase. As yet,\r\nthey only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on the left of the river, because, for\r\nwant of a bridge or boat, the Mercy had not yet been crossed. All the\r\nimmense woods, to which the name of the Forests of the Far West had been\r\ngiven, were not explored. They reserved this important excursion for the\r\nfirst fine days of the next spring. But Jacamar Wood was full of game;\r\nkangaroos and boars abounded, and the hunters’ iron-tipped spears and\r\nbows and arrows did wonders. Besides, Herbert discovered towards the\r\nsouthwest point of the lagoon a natural warren, a slightly damp meadow,\r\ncovered with willows and aromatic herbs which scented the air, such\r\nas thyme, basil, savory, all the sweet-scented species of the labiated\r\nplants, which the rabbits appeared to be particularly fond of.\r\n\r\nOn the reporter observing that since the table was spread for the\r\nrabbits, it was strange that the rabbits themselves should be wanting,\r\nthe two sportsmen carefully explored the warren. At any rate, it\r\nproduced an abundance of useful plants, and a naturalist would have had\r\na good opportunity of studying many specimens of the vegetable kingdom.\r\nHerbert gathered several shoots of the basil, rosemary, balm, betony,\r\netc., which possess different medicinal properties, some pectoral,\r\nastringent, febrifuge, others anti-spasmodic, or anti-rheumatic. When,\r\nafterwards, Pencroft asked the use of this collection of herbs,--\r\n\r\n“For medicine,” replied the lad, “to treat us when we are ill.”\r\n\r\n“Why should we be ill, since there are no doctors in the island?” asked\r\nPencroft quite seriously.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply to be made to that, but the lad went on with his\r\ncollection all the same, and it was well received at Granite House.\r\nBesides these medicinal herbs, he added a plant known in North America\r\nas “Oswego tea,” which made an excellent beverage.\r\n\r\nAt last, by searching thoroughly, the hunters arrived at the real site\r\nof the warren. There the ground was perforated like a sieve.\r\n\r\n“Here are the burrows!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the reporter, “so I see.”\r\n\r\n“But are they inhabited?”\r\n\r\n“That is the question.”\r\n\r\nThis was soon answered. Almost immediately, hundreds of little animals,\r\nsimilar to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such rapidity that\r\neven Top could not overtake them. Hunters and dog ran in vain; these\r\nrodents escaped them easily. But the reporter resolved not to leave the\r\nplace, until he had captured at least half-a-dozen of the quadrupeds.\r\nHe wished to stock their larder first, and domesticate those which they\r\nmight take later. It would not have been difficult to do this, with a\r\nfew snares stretched at the openings of the burrows. But at this moment\r\nthey had neither snares, nor anything to make them of. They must,\r\ntherefore, be satisfied with visiting each hole, and rummaging in it\r\nwith a stick, hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in\r\nany other way.\r\n\r\nAt last, after half an hour, four rodents were taken in their holes.\r\nThey were similar to their European brethren, and are commonly known by\r\nthe name of American rabbits.\r\n\r\nThis produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and figured\r\nat the evening repast. The tenants of the warren were not at all to be\r\ndespised, for they were delicious. It was a valuable resource of the\r\ncolony, and it appeared to be inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of May the partitions were finished. The rooms had now only\r\nto be furnished, and this would be work for the long winter days. A\r\nchimney was established in the first room, which served as a kitchen.\r\nThe pipe destined to conduct the smoke outside gave some trouble to\r\nthese amateur bricklayers. It appeared simplest to Harding to make it of\r\nbrick clay; as creating an outlet for it to the upper plateau was not to\r\nbe thought of, a hole was pierced in the granite above the window of\r\nthe kitchen, and the pipe met it like that of an iron stove. Perhaps\r\nthe winds which blew directly against the facade would make the chimney\r\nsmoke, but these winds were rare, and besides, Master Neb, the cook, was\r\nnot so very particular about that.\r\n\r\nWhen these interior arrangements were finished, the engineer occupied\r\nhimself in blocking up the outlet by the lake, so as to prevent any\r\naccess by that way. Masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and\r\nstrongly cemented together. Cyrus Harding did not yet realize his plan\r\nof drowning this opening under the waters of the lake, by restoring\r\nthem to their former level by means of a dam. He contented himself with\r\nhiding the obstruction with grass and shrubs, which were planted in the\r\ninterstices of the rocks, and which next spring would sprout thickly.\r\nHowever, he used the waterfall so as to lead a small stream of fresh\r\nwater to the new dwelling. A little trench, made below their level,\r\nproduced this result; and this derivation from a pure and inexhaustible\r\nsource yielded twenty-five or thirty gallons a day. There would never be\r\nany want of water at Granite House. At last all was finished, and it was\r\ntime, for the bad season was near. Thick shutters closed the windows of\r\nthe facade, until the engineer had time to make glass.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky projections\r\naround the windows plants of different kinds, as well as long streaming\r\ngrass, so that the openings were picturesquely framed in green, which\r\nhad a pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this solid, healthy, and secure dwelling, could not\r\nbut be charmed with their work. The view from the windows extended over\r\na boundless horizon, which was closed by the two Mandible Capes on the\r\nnorth, and Claw Cape on the south. All Union Bay was spread before them.\r\nYes, our brave settlers had reason to be satisfied, and Pencroft was\r\nlavish in his praise of what he humorously called, “his apartments on\r\nthe fifth floor above the ground!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20\r\n\r\nThe winter season set in with the month of June, which corresponds with\r\nthe month of December in the Northern Hemisphere. It began with showers\r\nand squalls, which succeeded each other without intermission. The\r\ntenants of Granite House could appreciate the advantages of a dwelling\r\nwhich sheltered them from the inclement weather. The Chimneys would have\r\nbeen quite insufficient to protect them against the rigor of winter, and\r\nit was to be feared that the high tides would make another irruption.\r\nCyrus Harding had taken precautions against this contingency, so as\r\nto preserve as much as possible the forge and furnace which were\r\nestablished there.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the month of June the time was employed in different\r\noccupations, which excluded neither hunting nor fishing, the larder\r\nbeing, therefore, abundantly supplied. Pencroft, so soon as he had\r\nleisure, proposed to set some traps, from which he expected great\r\nresults. He soon made some snares with creepers, by the aid of which the\r\nwarren henceforth every day furnished its quota of rodents. Neb employed\r\nnearly all his time in salting or smoking meat, which insured their\r\nalways having plenty of provisions. The question of clothes was now\r\nseriously discussed, the settlers having no other garments than those\r\nthey wore when the balloon threw them on the island. These clothes were\r\nwarm and good; they had taken great care of them as well as of their\r\nlinen, and they were perfectly whole, but they would soon need to be\r\nreplaced. Moreover, if the winter was severe, the settlers would suffer\r\ngreatly from cold.\r\n\r\nOn this subject the ingenuity of Harding was at fault. They must provide\r\nfor their most pressing wants, settle their dwelling, and lay in a\r\nstore of food; thus the cold might come upon them before the question\r\nof clothes had been settled. They must therefore make up their minds to\r\npass this first winter without additional clothing. When the fine season\r\ncame round again, they would regularly hunt those musmons which had been\r\nseen on the expedition to Mount Franklin, and the wool once collected,\r\nthe engineer would know how to make it into strong warm stuff.... How?\r\nHe would consider.\r\n\r\n“Well, we are free to roast ourselves at Granite House!” said Pencroft.\r\n“There are heaps of fuel, and no reason for sparing it.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” added Gideon Spilett, “Lincoln Island is not situated under\r\na very high latitude, and probably the winters here are not severe. Did\r\nyou not say, Cyrus, that this thirty-fifth parallel corresponded to that\r\nof Spain in the other hemisphere?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” replied the engineer, “but some winters in Spain are very\r\ncold! No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island is just as\r\nrigorously tried. However, it is an island, and as such, I hope that\r\nthe temperature will be more moderate.”\r\n\r\n“Why, captain?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Because the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense reservoir, in\r\nwhich is stored the heat of the summer. When winter comes, it restores\r\nthis heat, which insures for the regions near the ocean a medium\r\ntemperature, less high in summer, but less low in winter.”\r\n\r\n“We shall prove that,” replied Pencroft. “But I don’t want to bother\r\nmyself about whether it will be cold or not. One thing is certain, that\r\nis that the days are already short, and the evenings long. Suppose we\r\ntalk about the question of light.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is easier,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\n“To talk about?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“To settle.”\r\n\r\n“And when shall we begin?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, by having a seal hunt.”\r\n\r\n“To make candles?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the engineer’s project; and it was quite feasible, since he had\r\nlime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the islet would furnish\r\nthe fat necessary for the manufacture.\r\n\r\nThey were now at the 4th of June. It was Whit Sunday and they agreed to\r\nobserve this feast. All work was suspended, and prayers were offered\r\nto Heaven. But these prayers were now thanksgivings. The settlers in\r\nLincoln Island were no longer the miserable castaways thrown on the\r\nislet. They asked for nothing more--they gave thanks. The next day, the\r\n5th of June, in rather uncertain weather, they set out for the islet.\r\nThey had to profit by the low tide to cross the Channel, and it was\r\nagreed that they would construct, for this purpose, as well as they\r\ncould, a boat which would render communication so much easier, and\r\nwould also permit them to ascend the Mercy, at the time of their grand\r\nexploration of the southwest of the island, which was put off till the\r\nfirst fine days.\r\n\r\nThe seals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their iron-tipped\r\nspears, easily killed half-a-dozen. Neb and Pencroft skinned them, and\r\nonly brought back to Granite House their fat and skin, this skin being\r\nintended for the manufacture of boots.\r\n\r\nThe result of the hunt was this: nearly three hundred pounds of fat, all\r\nto be employed in the fabrication of candles.\r\n\r\nThe operation was extremely simple, and if it did not yield absolutely\r\nperfect results, they were at least very useful. Cyrus Harding would\r\nonly have had at his disposal sulphuric acid, but by heating this acid\r\nwith the neutral fatty bodies he could separate the glycerine; then from\r\nthis new combination, he easily separated the olein, the margarin, and\r\nthe stearin, by employing boiling water. But to simplify the operation,\r\nhe preferred to saponify the fat by means of lime. By this he obtained a\r\ncalcareous soap, easy to decompose by sulphuric acid, which precipitated\r\nthe lime into the state of sulphate, and liberated the fatty acids.\r\n\r\nFrom these three acids-oleic, margaric, and stearic-the first, being\r\nliquid, was driven out by a sufficient pressure. As to the two others,\r\nthey formed the very substance of which the candles were to be molded.\r\n\r\nThis operation did not last more than four and twenty hours. The wicks,\r\nafter several trials, were made of vegetable fibers, and dipped in the\r\nliquefied substance, they formed regular stearic candles, molded by the\r\nhand, which only wanted whiteness and polish. They would not doubtless\r\nhave the advantages of the wicks which are impregnated with boracic\r\nacid, and which vitrify as they burn and are entirely consumed, but\r\nCyrus Harding having manufactured a beautiful pair of snuffers, these\r\ncandles would be greatly appreciated during the long evenings in Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nDuring this month there was no want of work in the interior of their new\r\ndwelling. The joiners had plenty to do. They improved their tools, which\r\nwere very rough, and added others also.\r\n\r\nScissors were made among other things, and the settlers were at last\r\nable to cut their hair, and also to shave, or at least trim their\r\nbeards. Herbert had none, Neb but little, but their companions were\r\nbristling in a way which justified the making of the said scissors.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble, but at last an\r\ninstrument was obtained which, when vigorously handled, could divide the\r\nligneous fibers of the wood. They then made tables, seats, cupboards,\r\nto furnish the principal rooms, and bedsteads, of which all the bedding\r\nconsisted of grass mattresses. The kitchen, with its shelves, on which\r\nrested the cooking utensils, its brick stove, looked very well, and Neb\r\nworked away there as earnestly as if he was in a chemist’s laboratory.\r\n\r\nBut the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters. In fact, the\r\nwaterfall created by the explosion rendered the construction of two\r\nbridges necessary, one on Prospect Heights, the other on the shore. Now\r\nthe plateau and the shore were transversely divided by a watercourse,\r\nwhich had to be crossed to reach the northern part of the island. To\r\navoid it the colonists had been obliged to make a considerable detour,\r\nby climbing up to the source of the Red Creek. The simplest thing was to\r\nestablish on the plateau, and on the shore, two bridges from twenty to\r\nfive and twenty feet in length. All the carpenter’s work that was needed\r\nwas to clear some trees of their branches: this was a business of some\r\ndays. Directly the bridges were established, Neb and Pencroft profited\r\nby them to go to the oyster-bed which had been discovered near the\r\ndowns. They dragged with them a sort of rough cart, which replaced the\r\nformer inconvenient hurdle, and brought back some thousands of oysters,\r\nwhich soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth of\r\nthe Mercy. These molluscs were of excellent quality, and the colonists\r\nconsumed some daily.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that Lincoln Island, although its inhabitants had as\r\nyet only explored a small portion of it, already contributed to almost\r\nall their wants. It was probable that if they hunted into its most\r\nsecret recesses, in all the wooded part between the Mercy and Reptile\r\nPoint, they would find new treasures.\r\n\r\nThe settlers in Lincoln Island had still one privation. There was no\r\nwant of meat, nor of vegetable products; those ligneous roots which\r\nthey had found, when subjected to fermentation, gave them an acid drink,\r\nwhich was preferable to cold water; they also made sugar, without canes\r\nor beet-roots, by collecting the liquor which distils from the “acer\r\nsaceharinum,” a sort of maple-tree, which flourishes in all the temperate\r\nzones, and of which the island possessed a great number; they made\r\na very agreeable tea by employing the herbs brought from the warren;\r\nlastly, they had an abundance of salt, the only mineral which is used in\r\nfood... but bread was wanting.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some equivalent,\r\nit was possible that they might find the sago or the breadfruit tree\r\namong the forests of the south, but they had not as yet met with these\r\nprecious trees. However, Providence came directly to their aid, in an\r\ninfinitesimal proportion it is true, but Cyrus Harding, with all his\r\nintelligence, all his ingenuity, would never have been able to produce\r\nthat which, by the greatest chance, Herbert one day found in the lining\r\nof his waistcoat, which he was occupied in setting to rights.\r\n\r\nOn this day, as it was raining in torrents, the settlers were assembled\r\nin the great hall in Granite House, when the lad cried out all at\r\nonce,--\r\n\r\n“Look here, captain--A grain of corn!”\r\n\r\nAnd he showed his companions a grain--a single grain--which from a hole\r\nin his pocket had got into the lining of his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nThe presence of this grain was explained by the fact that Herbert, when\r\nat Richmond, used to feed some pigeons, of which Pencroft had made him a\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n“A grain of corn?” said the engineer quickly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, captain; but one, only one!”\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy,” said Pencroft, laughing, “we’re getting on capitally,\r\nupon my word! What shall we make with one grain of corn?”\r\n\r\n“We will make bread of it,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Bread, cakes, tarts!” replied the sailor. “Come, the bread that this\r\ngrain of corn will make won’t choke us very soon!”\r\n\r\nHerbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was going to\r\nthrow away the grain in question; but Harding took it, examined it,\r\nfound that it was in good condition, and looking the sailor full in the\r\nface--“Pencroft,” he asked quietly, “do you know how many ears one grain\r\nof corn can produce?”\r\n\r\n“One, I suppose!” replied the sailor, surprised at the question.\r\n\r\n“Ten, Pencroft! And do you know how many grains one ear bears?”\r\n\r\n“No, upon my word.”\r\n\r\n“About eighty!” said Cyrus Harding. “Then, if we plant this grain, at\r\nthe first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which at the second\r\nwill produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the third, five hundred\r\nand twelve millions; at the fourth, more than four hundred thousands of\r\nmillions! There is the proportion.”\r\n\r\nHarding’s companions listened without answering. These numbers\r\nastonished them. They were exact, however.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friends,” continued the engineer, “such are the arithmetical\r\nprogressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this multiplication\r\nof the grain of corn, of which the ear only bears eight hundred grains,\r\ncompared to the poppy-plant, which bears thirty-two thousand seeds; to\r\nthe tobacco-plant, which produces three hundred and sixty thousand? In\r\na few years, without the numerous causes of destruction, which arrests\r\ntheir fecundity, these plants would overrun the earth.”\r\n\r\nBut the engineer had not finished his lecture.\r\n\r\n“And now, Pencroft,” he continued, “do you know how many bushels four\r\nhundred thousand millions of grains would make?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the sailor; “but what I do know is, that I am nothing\r\nbetter than a fool!”\r\n\r\n“Well, they would make more than three millions, at a hundred and thirty\r\nthousand a bushel, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“Three millions!” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Three millions.”\r\n\r\n“In four years?”\r\n\r\n“In four years,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and even in two years, if, as I\r\nhope, in this latitude we can obtain two crops a year.”\r\n\r\nAt that, according to his usual custom, Pencroft could not reply\r\notherwise than by a tremendous hurrah.\r\n\r\n“So, Herbert,” added the engineer, “you have made a discovery of great\r\nimportance to us. Everything, my friends, everything can serve us in the\r\ncondition in which we are. Do not forget that, I beg of you.”\r\n\r\n“No, captain, no, we shan’t forget it,” replied Pencroft; “and if ever\r\nI find one of those tobacco-seeds, which multiply by three hundred and\r\nsixty thousand, I assure you I won’t throw it away! And now, what must\r\nwe do?”\r\n\r\n“We must plant this grain,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Gideon Spilett, “and with every possible care, for it bears\r\nin itself our future harvests.”\r\n\r\n“Provided it grows!” cried the sailor.\r\n\r\n“It will grow,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nThis was the 20th of June. The time was then propitious for sowing this\r\nsingle precious grain of corn. It was first proposed to plant it in\r\na pot, but upon reflection it was decided to leave it to nature, and\r\nconfide it to the earth. This was done that very day, and it is needless\r\nto add, that every precaution was taken that the experiment might\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThe weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height above\r\nGranite House. There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well sheltered\r\nfrom the wind, and exposed to all the heat of the midday sun. The place\r\nwas cleared, carefully weeded, and searched for insects and worms;\r\nthen a bed of good earth, improved with a little lime, was made; it was\r\nsurrounded by a railing; and the grain was buried in the damp earth.\r\n\r\nDid it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some\r\nedifice? It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only\r\nmatch, and all the anxiety of the operation. But this time the thing\r\nwas more serious. In fact, the castaways would have been always able\r\nto procure fire, in some mode or other, but no human power could supply\r\nanother grain of corn, if unfortunately this should be lost!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 21\r\n\r\nFrom this time Pencroft did not let a single day pass without going to\r\nvisit what he gravely called his “corn-field.” And woe to the insects\r\nwhich dared to venture there! No mercy was shown them.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the weather\r\nbecame decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit thermometer\r\nwould certainly have announced only twenty degrees above zero, that is\r\nconsiderably below the freezing-point. The next day, the 30th of June,\r\nthe day which corresponds to the 31st of December in the northern year,\r\nwas a Friday. Neb remarked that the year finished on a bad day, but\r\nPencroft replied that naturally the next would begin on a good one,\r\nwhich was better.\r\n\r\nAt any rate it commenced by very severe cold. Ice accumulated at the\r\nmouth of the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole expanse of the\r\nlake was frozen.\r\n\r\nThe settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood.\r\nPencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen, but had\r\nbrought enormous rafts of wood to their destination. The current was\r\nan indefatigable moving power, and it was employed in conveying the\r\nfloating wood to the moment when the frost enchained it. To the fuel\r\nwhich was so abundantly supplied by the forest, they added several\r\ncartloads of coal, which had to be brought from the foot of the spurs of\r\nMount Franklin. The powerful heat of the coal was greatly appreciated in\r\nthe low temperature, which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of\r\nFahrenheit, that is, thirteen degrees below zero. A second fireplace had\r\nbeen established in the dining-room, where they all worked together at\r\ntheir different avocations. During this period of cold, Cyrus Harding\r\nhad great cause to congratulate himself on having brought to Granite\r\nHouse the little stream of water from Lake Grant. Taken below the frozen\r\nsurface, and conducted through the passage, it preserved its fluidity,\r\nand arrived at an interior reservoir which had been hollowed out at the\r\nback part of the storeroom, while the overflow ran through the well to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists, clothed\r\nas warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the exploration of\r\nthat part of the island between the Mercy and Claw Cape. It was a wide\r\nextent of marshy land, and they would probably find good sport, for\r\nwater-birds ought to swarm there.\r\n\r\nThey reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go there,\r\nand as much to return, so that the whole of the day would be occupied.\r\nAs an unknown part of the island was about to be explored, the whole\r\ncolony took part in the expedition. Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at\r\nsix o’clock in the morning, when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding,\r\nGideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, armed with spears, snares,\r\nbows and arrows, and provided with provisions, left Granite House,\r\npreceded by Top, who bounded before them.\r\n\r\nTheir shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then covered\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“But,” as the engineer justly observed, “that could not take the place\r\nof a regular bridge!” So, the construction of a regular bridge was noted\r\nin the list of future works.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the right bank\r\nof the Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those gigantic and superb\r\nconiferae now sprinkled over with snow.\r\n\r\nBut they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole family of\r\nquadrupeds, who had made a home there, disturbed by Top, rushed forth\r\ninto the open country.\r\n\r\n“Ah! I should say those are foxes!” cried Herbert, when he saw the troop\r\nrapidly decamping.\r\n\r\nThey were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of\r\nbarking, at which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he stopped\r\nshort in the chase, and gave the swift animals time to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural History.\r\nBut, by their barking, these foxes, with reddish-gray hair, black tails\r\nterminating in a white tuft, had betrayed their origin. So Herbert\r\nwas able, without hesitating, to give them their real name of “Arctic\r\nfoxes.” They are frequently met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands,\r\nand in all parts of America traversed by the thirtieth and fortieth\r\nparallels. Herbert much regretted that Top had not been able to catch\r\none of these carnivora.\r\n\r\n“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft, who only regarded the\r\nrepresentatives of the fauna in the island from one special point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Herbert; “but zoologists have not yet found out if the\r\neye of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is correct to\r\nclass them in the genus dog, properly so called.”\r\n\r\nHarding could not help smiling on hearing the lad’s reflection, which\r\nshowed a thoughtful mind. As to the sailor, from the moment when he\r\nfound that the foxes were not classed in the genus eatable, they were\r\nnothing to him. However, when a poultry-yard was established at Granite\r\nHouse, he observed that it would be best to take some precautions\r\nagainst a probable visit from these four-legged plunderers, and no one\r\ndisputed this.\r\n\r\nAfter having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach washed by\r\nthe open sea. It was then eight o’clock in the morning. The sky was very\r\nclear, as it often is after prolonged cold; but warmed by their walk,\r\nneither Harding nor his companions felt the sharpness of the atmosphere\r\ntoo severely. Besides there was no wind, which made it much more\r\nbearable. A brilliant sun, but without any calorific action, was just\r\nissuing from the ocean. The sea was as tranquil and blue as that of a\r\nMediterranean gulf, when the sky is clear. Claw Cape, bent in the form\r\nof a yataghan, tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast. To\r\nthe left the edge of the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point.\r\nCertainly, in this part of Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the\r\nopen sea, not even a sandbank, ships beaten by the east winds would\r\nhave found no shelter. They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea, in\r\nwhich no shallows troubled the waters, by its uniform color, which was\r\nstained by no yellow shades, by the absence of even a reef, that the\r\ncoast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss. Behind in\r\nthe west, but at a distance of four miles, rose the first trees of the\r\nforests of the Far West. They might have believed themselves to be on\r\nthe desolate coast of some island in the Antarctic regions which the ice\r\nhad invaded. The colonists halted at this place for breakfast. A fire of\r\nbrushwood and dried seaweed was lighted, and Neb prepared the breakfast\r\nof cold meat, to which he added some cups of Oswego tea.\r\n\r\nWhile eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln Island was\r\nvery sterile, and contrasted with all the western part. The reporter\r\nwas thus led to observe that if chance had thrown them at first on the\r\nshore, they would have had but a deplorable idea of their future domain.\r\n\r\n“I believe that we should not have been able to reach it,” replied the\r\nengineer, “for the sea is deep, and there is not a rock on which we\r\ncould have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at least, there were\r\nsandbanks, an islet, which multiplied our chances of safety. Here,\r\nnothing but the depths!”\r\n\r\n“It is singular enough,” remarked Spilett, “that this comparatively\r\nsmall island should present such varied ground. This diversity of\r\naspect, logically only belongs to continents of a certain extent. One\r\nwould really say, that the western part of Lincoln Island, so rich and\r\nso fertile, is washed by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that\r\nits shores to the north and the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, my dear Spilett,” replied Cyrus Harding, “I have also\r\nobserved this. I think the form and also the nature of this island\r\nstrange. It is a summary of all the aspects which a continent presents,\r\nand I should not be surprised if it was a continent formerly.”\r\n\r\n“What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” replied Cyrus Harding. “Why should not Australia, New\r\nIreland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific, have\r\nonce formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe or Asia,\r\nas Africa or the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite possible that all\r\nthese islands, emerging from this vast ocean, are but the summits of\r\na continent, now submerged, but which was above the waters at a\r\nprehistoric period.”\r\n\r\n“As the Atlantis was formerly,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy... if, however, it existed.”\r\n\r\n“And would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?” asked\r\nPencroft.\r\n\r\n“It is probable,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and that would sufficiently,\r\nexplain the variety of productions which are seen on its surface.”\r\n\r\n“And the great number of animals which still inhabit it,” added Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer, “and you furnish me with an\r\nargument to support my theory. It is certain, after what we have seen,\r\nthat animals are numerous in this island, and what is more strange, that\r\nthe species are extremely varied. There is a reason for that, and to\r\nme it is that Lincoln Island may have formerly been a part of some vast\r\ncontinent which had gradually sunk below the Pacific.”\r\n\r\n“Then, some fine day,” said Pencroft, who did not appear to be entirely\r\nconvinced, “the rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its\r\nturn, and there will be nothing between America and Asia.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Harding, “there will be new continents which millions and\r\nmillions of animalculae are building at this moment.”\r\n\r\n“And what are these masons?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Coral insects,” replied Cyrus Harding. “By constant work they made the\r\nisland of Clermont-Tonnerre, and numerous other coral islands in the\r\nPacific Ocean. Forty-seven millions of these insects are needed to weigh\r\na grain, and yet, with the sea-salt they absorb, the solid elements of\r\nwater which they assimilate, these animalculae produce limestone, and\r\nthis limestone forms enormous submarine erections, of which the hardness\r\nand solidity equal granite. Formerly, at the first periods of creation,\r\nnature employing fire, heaved up the land, but now she entrusts to these\r\nmicroscopic creatures the task of replacing this agent, of which\r\nthe dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently\r\ndiminished--which is proved by the number of volcanoes on the surface of\r\nthe earth, now actually extinct. And I believe that centuries succeeding\r\nto centuries, and insects to insects, this Pacific may one day be\r\nchanged into a vast continent, which new generations will inhabit and\r\ncivilize in their turn.”\r\n\r\n“That will take a long time,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Nature has time for it,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But what would be the use of new continents?” asked Herbert. “It\r\nappears to me that the present extent of habitable countries is\r\nsufficient for humanity. Yet nature does nothing uselessly.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing uselessly, certainly,” replied the engineer, “but this is\r\nhow the necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly on the\r\ntropical zone occupied by the coral islands, may be explained. At least\r\nto me this explanation appears plausible.”\r\n\r\n“We are listening, captain,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“This is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our globe\r\nwill end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no longer be\r\npossible, because of the intense cold to which it will be subjected.\r\nWhat they are not agreed upon, is the cause of this cold. Some think\r\nthat it will arise from the falling of the temperature, which the\r\nsun will experience after millions of years; others, from the gradual\r\nextinction of the fires in the interior of our globe, which have a\r\ngreater influence on it than is generally supposed. I hold to this last\r\nhypothesis, grounding it on the fact that the moon is really a cold\r\nstar, which is no longer habitable, although the sun continues to throw\r\non its surface the same amount of heat. If, then, the moon has become\r\ncold, it is because the interior fires to which, as do all the stars of\r\nthe stellar world, it owes its origin, are completely extinct. Lastly,\r\nwhatever may be the cause, our globe will become cold some day, but this\r\ncold will only operate gradually. What will happen, then? The temperate\r\nzones, at a more or less distant period, will not be more habitable than\r\nthe polar regions now are. Then the population of men, as well as the\r\nanimals, will flow towards the latitudes which are more directly under\r\nthe solar influence. An immense emigration will take place. Europe,\r\nCentral Asia, North America, will gradually be abandoned, as well as\r\nAustralasia and the lower parts of South America. The vegetation will\r\nfollow the human emigration. The flora will retreat towards the Equator\r\nat the same time as the fauna. The central parts of South America and\r\nAfrica will be the continents chiefly inhabited. The Laplanders and the\r\nSamoides will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean. Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions\r\nwill not be too small, to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity? Now,\r\nmay not provident nature, so as to give refuge to all the vegetable\r\nand animal emigration, be at present laying the foundation of a new\r\ncontinent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted these\r\ninsects with the construction of it? I have often thought of all these\r\nthings, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect of our\r\nglobe will some day be completely changed; that by the raising of new\r\ncontinents the sea will cover the old, and that, in future ages,\r\na Columbus will go to discover the islands of Chimborazo, of the\r\nHimalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America, Asia,\r\nand Europe. Then these new continents will become, in their turn,\r\nuninhabitable; heat will die away, as does the heat from a body when\r\nthe soul has left it; and life will disappear from the globe, if not for\r\never, at least for a period. Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest--will\r\nbe left to death--to revive some day under superior conditions! But\r\nall that, my friends, is the secret of the Author of all things; and\r\nbeginning by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be\r\ncarried too far, in investigating the secrets of the future.\r\n\r\n“My dear Cyrus,” replied Spilett, “these theories are prophecies to me,\r\nand they will be accomplished some day.”\r\n\r\n“That is the secret of God,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“All that is well and good,” then said Pencroft, who had listened with\r\nall his might, “but will you tell me, captain, if Lincoln Island has\r\nbeen made by your insects?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Harding; “it is of a purely volcanic origin.”\r\n\r\n“Then it will disappear some day?”\r\n\r\n“That is probable.”\r\n\r\n“I hope we won’t be here then.”\r\n\r\n“No, don’t be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we have no\r\nwish to die here, and hope to get away some time.”\r\n\r\n“In the meantime,” replied Gideon Spilett, “let us establish ourselves\r\nhere as if forever. There is no use in doing things by halves.”\r\n\r\nThis ended the conversation. Breakfast was finished, the exploration was\r\ncontinued, and the settlers arrived at the border of the marshy\r\nregion. It was a marsh of which the extent, to the rounded coast which\r\nterminated the island at the southeast, was about twenty square miles.\r\nThe soil was formed of clayey flint-earth, mingled with vegetable\r\nmatter, such as the remains of rushes, reeds, grass, etc. Here and there\r\nbeds of grass, thick as a carpet, covered it. In many places icy pools\r\nsparkled in the sun. Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden\r\nswelling, could supply these ponds. They therefore naturally concluded\r\nthat the marsh was fed by the infiltrations of the soil and it was\r\nreally so. It was also to be feared that during the heat miasmas would\r\narise, which might produce fevers.\r\n\r\nAbove the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water,\r\nfluttered numbers of birds. Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in\r\nflocks, and those fearless birds allowed themselves to be easily\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nOne shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen of the\r\nbirds, they were so close together. The explorers were, however, obliged\r\nto content themselves with bows and arrows. The result was less, but the\r\nsilent arrow had the advantage of not frightening the birds, while the\r\nnoise of firearms would have dispersed them to all parts of the marsh.\r\nThe hunters were satisfied, for this time, with a dozen ducks, which had\r\nwhite bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black, white,\r\nand red, and flattened beak. Herbert called them tadorns. Top helped in\r\nthe capture of these birds, whose name was given to this marshy part of\r\nthe island. The settlers had here an abundant reserve of aquatic game.\r\nAt some future time they meant to explore it more carefully, and it was\r\nprobable that some of the birds there might be domesticated, or at least\r\nbrought to the shores of the lake, so that they would be more within\r\ntheir reach.\r\n\r\nAbout five o’clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his companions\r\nretraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing Tadorn’s Fens, and\r\ncrossed the Mercy on the ice-bridge.\r\n\r\nAt eight in the evening they all entered Granite House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 22\r\n\r\nThis intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without, however,\r\npassing the degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned. When the atmosphere\r\nwas calm, the low temperature was easily borne, but when the wind blew,\r\nthe poor settlers, insufficiently clothed, felt it severely. Pencroft\r\nregretted that Lincoln Island was not the home of a few families of\r\nbears rather than of so many foxes and seals.\r\n\r\n“Bears,” said he, “are generally very well dressed, and I ask no more\r\nthan to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have on their\r\nbacks.”\r\n\r\n“But,” replied Neb, laughing, “perhaps the bears would not consent to\r\ngive you their cloaks, Pencroft. These beasts are not St. Martins.”\r\n\r\n“We would make them do it, Neb, we would make them,” replied Pencroft,\r\nin quite an authoritative tone.\r\n\r\nBut these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or at any\r\nrate they had not yet shown themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied\r\nthemselves with making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nAccording to the sailor, any animal, whatever it was, would be a lawful\r\nprize, and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the new snares\r\nwould be well received at Granite House.\r\n\r\nThe traps were besides extremely simple; being pits dug in the ground,\r\na platform of branches and grass above, which concealed the opening, and\r\nat the bottom some bait, the scent of which would attract animals. It\r\nmust be mentioned also, that they had not been dug at random, but\r\nat certain places where numerous footprints showed that quadrupeds\r\nfrequented the ground. They were visited every day, and at three\r\ndifferent times, during the first days, specimens of those Antarctic\r\nfoxes which they had already seen on the right bank of the Mercy were\r\nfound in them.\r\n\r\n“Why, there are nothing but foxes in this country!” cried Pencroft, when\r\nfor the third time he drew one of the animals out of the pit. Looking at\r\nit in great disgust, he added, “beasts which are good for nothing!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Gideon Spilett, “they are good for something!”\r\n\r\n“And what is that?”\r\n\r\n“To make bait to attract other creatures!”\r\n\r\nThe reporter was right, and the traps were henceforward baited with the\r\nfoxes carcasses.\r\n\r\nThe sailor had also made snares from the long tough fibers of a certain\r\nplant, and they were even more successful than the traps. Rarely a day\r\npassed without some rabbits from the warren being caught. It was always\r\nrabbit, but Neb knew how to vary his sauces and the settlers did not\r\nthink of complaining.\r\n\r\nHowever, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps supplied\r\nthe hunters with other animals more useful than foxes, namely, several\r\nof those small wild boars which had already been seen to the north of\r\nthe lake. Pencroft had no need to ask if these beasts were eatable. He\r\ncould see that by their resemblance to the pig of America and Europe.\r\n\r\n“But these are not pigs,” said Herbert to him, “I warn you of that,\r\nPencroft.”\r\n\r\n“My boy,” replied the sailor, bending over the trap and drawing out one\r\nof these representatives of the family of sus by the little appendage\r\nwhich served it as a tail. “Let me believe that these are pigs.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because that pleases me!”\r\n\r\n“Are you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?”\r\n\r\n“I am very fond of pig,” replied the sailor, “particularly of its feet,\r\nand if it had eight instead of four, I should like it twice as much!”\r\n\r\nAs to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to one of\r\nthe four species which are included in the family, and they were also of\r\nthe species of Tajacu, recognizable by their deep color and the absence\r\nof those long teeth with which the mouths of their congeners are armed.\r\nThese peccaries generally live in herds, and it was probable that they\r\nabounded in the woody parts of the island.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft did not\r\nask more from them.\r\n\r\nTowards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was suddenly\r\nmoderated by the wind shifting to the northwest. The temperature rose\r\nsome degrees, and the accumulated vapor in the air was not long in\r\nresolving into snow. All the island was covered with a sheet of white,\r\nand showed itself to its inhabitants under a new aspect. The snow fell\r\nabundantly for several days, and it soon reached a thickness of two\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of Granite\r\nHouse the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs. In some\r\nplaces, the wind, eddying round the corners, formed the snow into tall\r\nwhirling columns, resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their\r\nbase, and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun. However, the\r\nstorm, coming from the northwest, blew across the island, and the\r\nposition of Granite House preserved it from a direct attack.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of this snow-storm, as terrible as if it had been\r\nproduced in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions\r\ncould, notwithstanding their wish for it, venture forth, and they\r\nremained shut up for five days, from the 20th to the 25th of August.\r\nThey could hear the tempest raging in Jacamar Wood, which would surely\r\nsuffer from it. Many of the trees would no doubt be torn up by the\r\nroots, but Pencroft consoled himself by thinking that he would not have\r\nthe trouble of cutting them down.\r\n\r\n“The wind is turning woodman, let it alone,” he repeated.\r\n\r\nBesides, there was no way of stopping it, if they had wished to do so.\r\n\r\nHow grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to Heaven for\r\nhaving prepared for them this solid and immovable retreat! Cyrus Harding\r\nhad also his legitimate share of thanks, but after all, it was Nature\r\nwho had hollowed out this vast cavern, and he had only discovered it.\r\nThere all were in safety, and the tempest could not reach them. If\r\nthey had constructed a house of bricks and wood on Prospect Heights,\r\nit certainly would not have resisted the fury of this storm. As to\r\nthe Chimneys, it must have been absolutely uninhabitable, for the sea,\r\npassing over the islet, would beat furiously against it. But here, in\r\nGranite House, in the middle of a solid mass, over which neither the sea\r\nnor air had any influence, there was nothing to fear.\r\n\r\nDuring these days of seclusion the settlers did not remain inactive.\r\n\r\nThere was no want of wood, cut up into planks, in the storeroom, and\r\nlittle by little they completed their furnishing; constructing the\r\nmost solid of tables and chairs, for material was not spared. Neb and\r\nPencroft were very proud of this rather heavy furniture, which they\r\nwould not have changed on any account.\r\n\r\nThen the carpenters became basket-makers, and they did not succeed badly\r\nin this new manufacture. At the point of the lake which projected to the\r\nnorth, they had discovered an osier-bed in which grew a large number\r\nof purple osiers. Before the rainy season, Pencroft and Herbert had cut\r\ndown these useful shrubs, and their branches, well prepared, could now\r\nbe effectively employed. The first attempts were somewhat crude, but\r\nin consequence of the cleverness and intelligence of the workmen,\r\nby consulting, and recalling the models which they had seen, and by\r\nemulating each other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased\r\nby several baskets of different sizes. The storeroom was provided with\r\nthem, and in special baskets Neb placed his collection of rhizomes,\r\nstone-pine almonds, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again.\r\nThe temperature fell a little, and the tempest abated. The colonists\r\nsallied out directly. There was certainly two feet of snow on the shore,\r\nbut they were able to walk without much difficulty on the hardened\r\nsurface. Cyrus Harding and his companions climbed Prospect Heights.\r\n\r\nWhat a change! The woods, which they had left green, especially in the\r\npart at which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a uniform\r\ncolor. All was white, from the summit of Mount Franklin to the shore,\r\nthe forests, the plains, the lake, the river. The waters of the Mercy\r\nflowed under a roof of ice, which, at each rising and ebbing of the\r\ntide, broke up with loud crashes. Numerous birds fluttered over the\r\nfrozen surface of the lake. Ducks and snipe, teal and guillemots were\r\nassembled in thousands. The rocks among which the cascade flowed were\r\nbristling with icicles. One might have said that the water escaped by a\r\nmonstrous gargoyle, shaped with all the imagination of an artist of the\r\nRenaissance. As to the damage caused by the storm in the forest, that\r\ncould not as yet be ascertained; they would have to wait till the snowy\r\ncovering was dissipated.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert did not miss this opportunity of\r\ngoing to visit their traps. They did not find them easily, under the\r\nsnow with which they were covered. They had also to be careful not to\r\nfall into one or other of them, which would have been both dangerous and\r\nhumiliating; to be taken in their own snares! But happily they avoided\r\nthis unpleasantness, and found their traps perfectly intact. No animal\r\nhad fallen into them, and yet the footprints in the neighborhood were\r\nvery numerous, among others, certain very clear marks of claws. Herbert\r\ndid not hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had\r\npassed there, which justified the engineer’s opinion that dangerous\r\nbeasts existed in Lincoln Island. These animals doubtless generally\r\nlived in the forests of the Far West, but pressed by hunger, they had\r\nventured as far as Prospect Heights. Perhaps they had smelled out the\r\ninhabitants of Granite House. “Now, what are these feline creatures?”\r\n asked Pencroft. “They are tigers,” replied Herbert. “I thought those\r\nbeasts were only found in hot countries?”\r\n\r\n“On the new continent,” replied the lad, “they are found from Mexico to\r\nthe Pampas of Buenos Aires. Now, as Lincoln Island is nearly under the\r\nsame latitude as the provinces of La Plata, it is not surprising that\r\ntigers are to be met with in it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we must look out for them,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\nHowever, the snow soon disappeared, quickly dissolving under the\r\ninfluence of the rising temperature. Rain fell, and the sheet of white\r\nsoon vanished. Notwithstanding the bad weather, the settlers renewed\r\ntheir stores of different things, stone-pine almonds, rhizomes, syrup\r\nfrom the maple-tree, for the vegetable part; rabbits from the warren,\r\nagouties, and kangaroos for the animal part. This necessitated several\r\nexcursions into the forest, and they found that a great number of trees\r\nhad been blown down by the last hurricane. Pencroft and Neb also pushed\r\nwith the cart as far as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons\r\nof fuel. They saw in passing that the pottery kiln had been severely\r\ndamaged by the wind, at least six feet of it having been blown off.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as the coal, the store of wood was renewed at Granite\r\nHouse, and they profited by the current of the Mercy having again become\r\nfree, to float down several rafts. They could see that the cold period\r\nwas not ended.\r\n\r\nA visit was also paid to the Chimneys, and the settlers could not but\r\ncongratulate themselves on not having been living there during the\r\nhurricane. The sea had left unquestionable traces of its ravages.\r\nSweeping over the islet, it had furiously assailed the passages, half\r\nfilling them with sand, while thick beds of seaweed covered the rocks.\r\nWhile Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft hunted or collected wood, Cyrus Harding\r\nand Gideon Spilett busied themselves in putting the Chimneys to rights,\r\nand they found the forge and the bellows almost unhurt, protected as\r\nthey had been from the first by the heaps of sand.\r\n\r\nThe store of fuel had not been made uselessly. The settlers had not done\r\nwith the rigorous cold. It is known that, in the Northern Hemisphere,\r\nthe month of February is principally distinguished by rapid fallings of\r\nthe temperature. It is the same in the Southern Hemisphere, and the end\r\nof the month of August, which is the February of North America, does not\r\nescape this climatic law.\r\n\r\nAbout the 25th, after another change from snow to rain, the wind shifted\r\nto the southeast, and the cold became, suddenly, very severe. According\r\nto the engineer’s calculation, the mercurial column of a Fahrenheit\r\nthermometer would not have marked less than eight degrees below zero,\r\nand this intense cold, rendered still more painful by a sharp gale,\r\nlasted for several days. The colonists were again shut up in Granite\r\nHouse, and as it was necessary to hermetically seal all the openings\r\nof the facade, only leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air, the\r\nconsumption of candles was considerable. To economize them, the cavern\r\nwas often only lighted by the blazing hearths, on which fuel was not\r\nspared. Several times, one or other of the settlers descended to the\r\nbeach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide, but\r\nthey soon climbed up again to Granite House, and it was not without pain\r\nand difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder.\r\nIn consequence of the intense cold, their fingers felt as if burned when\r\nthey touched the rounds. To occupy the leisure hours, which the tenants\r\nof Granite House now had at their disposal, Cyrus Harding undertook an\r\noperation which could be performed indoors.\r\n\r\nWe know that the settlers had no other sugar at their disposal than\r\nthe liquid substance which they drew from the maple, by making deep\r\nincisions in the tree. They contented themselves with collecting this\r\nliquor in jars and employing it in this state for different culinary\r\npurposes, and the more so, as on growing old, this liquid began to\r\nbecome white and to be of a syrupy consistence.\r\n\r\nBut there was something better to be made of it, and one day Cyrus\r\nHarding announced that they were going to turn into refiners.\r\n\r\n“Refiners!” replied Pencroft. “That is rather a warm trade, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Very warm,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Then it will be seasonable!” said the sailor.\r\n\r\nThis word refining need not awake in the mind thoughts of an elaborate\r\nmanufactory with apparatus and numerous workmen. No! to crystallize this\r\nliquor, only an extremely easy operation is required. Placed on the fire\r\nin large earthen pots, it was simply subjected to evaporation, and\r\nsoon a scum arose to its surface. As soon as this began to thicken,\r\nNeb carefully removed it with a wooden spatula; this accelerated the\r\nevaporation, and at the same time prevented it from contracting an\r\nempyreumatic flavor.\r\n\r\nAfter boiling for several hours on a hot fire, which did as much good to\r\nthe operators as the substance operated upon, the latter was transformed\r\ninto a thick syrup. This syrup was poured into clay molds, previously\r\nfabricated in the kitchen stove, and to which they had given various\r\nshapes. The next day this syrup had become cold, and formed cakes\r\nand tablets. This was sugar of rather a reddish color, but nearly\r\ntransparent and of a delicious taste.\r\n\r\nThe cold continued to the middle of September, and the prisoners in\r\nGranite House began to find their captivity rather tedious. Nearly every\r\nday they attempted sorties which they could not prolong. They constantly\r\nworked at the improvement of their dwelling. They talked while working.\r\nHarding instructed his companions in many things, principally explaining\r\nto them the practical applications of science. The colonists had no\r\nlibrary at their disposal; but the engineer was a book which was always\r\nat hand, always open at the page which one wanted, a book which answered\r\nall their questions, and which they often consulted. The time thus\r\npassed away pleasantly, these brave men not appearing to have any fears\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, all were anxious to see, if not the fine season, at least the\r\ncessation of the insupportable cold. If only they had been clothed in a\r\nway to meet it, how many excursions they would have attempted, either to\r\nthe downs or to Tadorn’s Fens! Game would have been easily approached,\r\nand the chase would certainly have been most productive. But Cyrus\r\nHarding considered it of importance that no one should injure his\r\nhealth, for he had need of all his hands, and his advice was followed.\r\n\r\nBut it must be said, that the one who was most impatient of this\r\nimprisonment, after Pencroft perhaps, was Top. The faithful dog found\r\nGranite House very narrow. He ran backwards and forwards from one\r\nroom to another, showing in his way how weary he was of being shut\r\nup. Harding often remarked that when he approached the dark well which\r\ncommunicated with the sea, and of which the orifice opened at the back\r\nof the storeroom, Top uttered singular growlings. He ran round and round\r\nthis hole, which had been covered with a wooden lid. Sometimes even he\r\ntried to put his paws under the lid, as if he wished to raise it.\r\nHe then yelped in a peculiar way, which showed at once anger and\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe engineer observed this maneuver several times.\r\n\r\nWhat could there be in this abyss to make such an impression on the\r\nintelligent animal? The well led to the sea, that was certain. Could\r\nnarrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?\r\nDid some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom\r\nof this well? The engineer did not know what to think, and could not\r\nrefrain from dreaming of many strange improbabilities. Accustomed to go\r\nfar into the regions of scientific reality, he would not allow\r\nhimself to be drawn into the regions of the strange and almost of the\r\nsupernatural; but yet how to explain why Top, one of those sensible dogs\r\nwho never waste their time in barking at the moon, should persist in\r\ntrying with scent and hearing to fathom this abyss, if there was nothing\r\nthere to cause his uneasiness? Top’s conduct puzzled Cyrus Harding even\r\nmore than he cared to acknowledge to himself.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the engineer only communicated his impressions to Gideon\r\nSpilett, for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the\r\nsuspicions which arose from what perhaps was only Top’s fancy.\r\n\r\nAt last the cold ceased. There had been rain, squalls mingled with snow,\r\nhailstorms, gusts of wind, but these inclemencies did not last. The ice\r\nmelted, the snow disappeared; the shore, the plateau, the banks of\r\nthe Mercy, the forest, again became practicable. This return of spring\r\ndelighted the tenants of Granite House, and they soon only passed in it\r\nthe hours necessary for eating and sleeping.\r\n\r\nThey hunted much in the second part of September, which led Pencroft to\r\nagain entreat for the firearms, which he asserted had been promised by\r\nCyrus Harding. The latter, knowing well that without special tools it\r\nwould be nearly impossible for him to manufacture a gun which would be\r\nof any use, still drew back and put off the operation to some future\r\ntime, observing in his usual dry way, that Herbert and Spilett had\r\nbecome very skilful archers, so that many sorts of excellent animals,\r\nagouties, kangaroos, capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, snipes,\r\nin short, game both with fur and feathers, fell victims to their arrows,\r\nand that, consequently, they could wait. But the obstinate sailor would\r\nlisten to nothing of this, and he would give the engineer no peace till\r\nhe promised to satisfy his desire. Gideon Spilett, however, supported\r\nPencroft.\r\n\r\n“If, which may be doubted,” said he, “the island is inhabited by wild\r\nbeasts, we must think how to fight with and exterminate them. A time may\r\ncome when this will be our first duty.”\r\n\r\nBut at this period, it was not the question of firearms which occupied\r\nHarding, but that of clothes. Those which the settlers wore had passed\r\nthis winter, but they would not last until next winter. Skins of\r\ncarnivora or the wool of ruminants must be procured at any price, and\r\nsince there were plenty of musmons, it was agreed to consult on the\r\nmeans of forming a flock which might be brought up for the use of the\r\ncolony. An enclosure for the domestic animals, a poultry-yard for the\r\nbirds, in a word to establish a sort of farm in the island, such were\r\nthe two important projects for the fine season.\r\n\r\nIn consequence and in view of these future establishments, it became\r\nof much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown\r\nparts of Lincoln Island, that is to say, through that thick forest which\r\nextended on the right bank of the Mercy, from its mouth to the extremity\r\nof the Serpentine Peninsula, as well as on the whole of its western\r\nside. But this needed settled weather, and a month must pass before this\r\nexploration could be profitably undertaken.\r\n\r\nThey therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident occurred\r\nwhich increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nIt was the 24th of October. On this day, Pencroft had gone to visit his\r\ntraps, which he always kept properly baited. In one of them he found\r\nthree animals which would be very welcome for the larder. They were a\r\nfemale peccary and her two young ones.\r\n\r\nPencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his capture,\r\nand, as usual, he made a great show of his game.\r\n\r\n“Come, we shall have a grand feast, captain!” he exclaimed. “And you\r\ntoo, Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!”\r\n\r\n“I shall be very happy,” replied the reporter; “but what is it that I am\r\ngoing to eat?”\r\n\r\n“Suckling-pig.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed, suckling-pig, Pencroft? To hear you, I thought that you\r\nwere bringing back a young partridge stuffed with truffles!”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Pencroft. “Do you mean to say that you turn up your nose\r\nat suckling-pig?’\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm; “provided\r\none doesn’t eat too much.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right, that’s right,” returned the sailor, who was not pleased\r\nwhenever he heard his chase made light of. “You like to make objections.\r\nSeven months ago, when we landed on the island, you would have been only\r\ntoo glad to have met with such game!”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” replied the reporter, “man is never perfect, nor\r\ncontented.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Pencroft, “I hope that Neb will distinguish himself. Look\r\nhere! These two little peccaries are not more than three months old!\r\nThey will be as tender as quails! Come along, Neb, come! I will look\r\nafter the cooking myself.”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor, followed by Neb, entered the kitchen, where they were\r\nsoon absorbed in their culinary labors.\r\n\r\nThey were allowed to do it in their own way. Neb, therefore, prepared\r\na magnificent repast--the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, a smoked\r\nham, stone-pine almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all the best that they\r\nhad, but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory\r\npeccaries.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House.\r\nThe kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it excellent.\r\n\r\nTo the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on carving\r\nhimself, and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nThese suckling-pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was devouring\r\nhis share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an oath escaped\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“The matter? the matter is that I have just broken a tooth!” replied the\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n“What, are there pebbles in your peccaries?” said Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” replied Pencroft, drawing from his lips the object which\r\nhad cost him a grinder--!\r\n\r\nIt was not a pebble--it was a leaden bullet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2\r\n\r\nABANDONED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nIt was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been\r\nthrown on Lincoln Island. During that time, notwithstanding the\r\nresearches they had made, no human being had been discovered. No smoke\r\neven had betrayed the presence of man on the surface of the island. No\r\nvestiges of his handiwork showed that either at an early or at a late\r\nperiod had man lived there. Not only did it now appear to be uninhabited\r\nby any but themselves, but the colonists were compelled to believe that\r\nit never had been inhabited. And now, all this scaffolding of reasonings\r\nfell before a simple ball of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive\r\nrodent! In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who\r\nbut a human being could have used such a weapon?\r\n\r\nWhen Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions looked\r\nat it with intense astonishment. All the consequences likely to result\r\nfrom this incident, notwithstanding its apparent insignificance,\r\nimmediately took possession of their minds. The sudden apparition of a\r\nsupernatural being could not have startled them more completely.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the suggestions\r\nwhich this fact, at once surprising and unexpected, could not fail to\r\nraise in his mind. He took the bullet, turned it over and over, rolled\r\nit between his finger and thumb; then, turning to Pencroft, he asked,--\r\n\r\n“Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than\r\nthree months old?”\r\n\r\n“Not more, captain,” replied Pencroft. “It was still sucking its mother\r\nwhen I found it in the trap.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the engineer, “that proves that within three months a\r\ngun-shot was fired in Lincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“And that a bullet,” added Gideon Spilett, “wounded, though not\r\nmortally, this little animal.”\r\n\r\n“That is unquestionable,” said Cyrus Harding, “and these are the\r\ndeductions which must be drawn from this incident: that the island was\r\ninhabited before our arrival, or that men have landed here within three\r\nmonths. Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by\r\ndisembarking on the shore or by being wrecked? This point can only be\r\ncleared up later. As to what they were, Europeans or Malays, enemies or\r\nfriends of our race, we cannot possibly guess; and if they still inhabit\r\nthe island, or if they have left it, we know not. But these questions\r\nare of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled.”\r\n\r\n“No! a hundred times no! a thousand times no!” cried the sailor,\r\nspringing up from the table. “There are no other men than ourselves on\r\nLincoln Island! By my faith! The island isn’t large and if it had been\r\ninhabited, we should have seen some of the inhabitants long before\r\nthis!”\r\n\r\n“In fact, the contrary would be very astonishing,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“But it would be much more astonishing, I should think,” observed the\r\nreporter, “if this peccary had been born with a bullet in its inside!”\r\n\r\n“At least,” said Neb seriously, “if Pencroft has not had--”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Neb,” burst out Pencroft. “Do you think I could have a\r\nbullet in my jaw for five or six months without finding it out?\r\nWhere could it be hidden?” he asked, opening his mouth to show the\r\ntwo-and-thirty teeth with which it was furnished. “Look well, Neb, and\r\nif you find one hollow tooth in this set, I will let you pull out half a\r\ndozen!”\r\n\r\n“Neb’s supposition is certainly inadmissible,” replied Harding, who,\r\nnotwithstanding the gravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile.\r\n“It is certain that a gun has been fired in the island, within three\r\nmonths at most. But I am inclined to think that the people who landed\r\non this coast were only here a very short time ago, or that they just\r\ntouched here; for if, when we surveyed the island from the summit of\r\nMount Franklin, it had been inhabited, we should have seen them or we\r\nshould have been seen ourselves. It is therefore, probable that within\r\nonly a few weeks castaways have been thrown by a storm on some part of\r\nthe coast. However that may be, it is of consequence to us to have this\r\npoint settled.”\r\n\r\n“I think that we should act with caution,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Such is my advice,” replied Cyrus Harding, “for it is to be feared that\r\nMalay pirates have landed on the island!”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” asked the sailor, “would it not be a good plan, before\r\nsetting out, to build a canoe in which we could either ascend the\r\nriver, or, if we liked, coast round the inland? It will not do to be\r\nunprovided.”\r\n\r\n“Your idea is good, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “but we cannot wait\r\nfor that. It would take at least a month to build a boat.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a real boat,” replied the sailor; “but we do not want one for a\r\nsea voyage, and in five days at the most, I will undertake to construct\r\na canoe fit to navigate the Mercy.”\r\n\r\n“Five days,” cried Neb, “to build a boat?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Neb; a boat in the Indian fashion.”\r\n\r\n“Of wood?” asked the Negro, looking still unconvinced.\r\n\r\n“Of wood,” replied Pencroft, “or rather of bark. I repeat, captain, that\r\nin five days the work will be finished!”\r\n\r\n“In five days, then, be it,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But till that time we must be very watchful,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Very watchful indeed, my friends,” replied Harding; “and I beg you to\r\nconfine your hunting excursions to the neighborhood of Granite House.”\r\n\r\nThe dinner ended less gaily than Pencroft had hoped.\r\n\r\nSo, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than the\r\nsettlers. Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it was\r\nhereafter an unquestionable fact, and such a discovery could not but\r\ncause great uneasiness among the colonists.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed long about\r\nthe matter. They asked themselves if by chance this incident might not\r\nhave some connection with the inexplicable way in which the engineer had\r\nbeen saved, and the other peculiar circumstances which had struck them\r\nat different times. However, Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the\r\npros and cons of the question, ended by saying,--\r\n\r\n“In short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear Spilett?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cyrus.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we\r\nshall find nothing.”\r\n\r\nThe next day Pencroft set to work. He did not mean to build a boat with\r\nboards and planking, but simply a flat-bottomed canoe, which would be\r\nwell suited for navigating the Mercy--above all, for approaching its\r\nsource, where the water would naturally be shallow. Pieces of bark,\r\nfastened one to the other, would form a light boat; and in case of\r\nnatural obstacles, which would render a portage necessary, it would be\r\neasily carried. Pencroft intended to secure the pieces of bark by means\r\nof nails, to insure the canoe being water-tight.\r\n\r\nIt was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a strong\r\nand supple bark for the work. Now the last storm had brought down a\r\nnumber of large birch-trees, the bark of which would be perfectly suited\r\nfor their purpose. Some of these trees lay on the ground, and they had\r\nonly to be barked, which was the most difficult thing of all, owing to\r\nthe imperfect tools which the settlers possessed. However, they overcame\r\nall difficulties.\r\n\r\nWhile the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied himself\r\nwithout losing an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not idle.\r\n\r\nThey were made purveyors to the colony. The reporter could not but\r\nadmire the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the bow and\r\nspear. Herbert also showed great courage and much of that presence of\r\nmind which may justly be called “the reasoning of bravery.” These two\r\ncompanions of the chase, remembering Cyrus Harding’s recommendations,\r\ndid not go beyond a radius of two miles round Granite House; but\r\nthe borders of the forest furnished a sufficient tribute of agoutis,\r\ncapybaras, kangaroos, peccaries, etc.; and if the result from the traps\r\nwas less than during the cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed\r\nquota, which might have fed all the colony in Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nOften during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon Spilett on the\r\nincident of the bullet, and the deductions which the engineer drew from\r\nit, and one day--it was the 26th of October--he said--“But, Mr. Spilett,\r\ndo you not think it very extraordinary that, if any castaways have\r\nlanded on the island, they have not yet shown themselves near Granite\r\nHouse?”\r\n\r\n“Very astonishing if they are still here,” replied the reporter, “but\r\nnot astonishing at all if they are here no longer!”\r\n\r\n“So you think that these people have already quitted the island?”\r\n returned Herbert.\r\n\r\n“It is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was prolonged, and\r\nabove all, if they were still here, some accident would have at last\r\nbetrayed their presence.”\r\n\r\n“But if they were able to go away,” observed the lad, “they could not\r\nhave been castaways.”\r\n\r\n“No, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called provisional\r\ncastaways. It is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the\r\nisland without destroying their vessel, and that, the storm over, they\r\nwent away again.”\r\n\r\n“I must acknowledge one thing,” said Herbert, “it is that Captain\r\nHarding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of human beings\r\non our island.”\r\n\r\n“In short,” responded the reporter, “there are only Malays who frequent\r\nthese seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is best to avoid.”\r\n\r\n“It is not impossible, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert, “that some day or\r\nother we may find traces of their landing.”\r\n\r\n“I do not say no, my boy. A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire, would\r\nput us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our next\r\nexpedition.”\r\n\r\nThe day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of the\r\nforest near the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees. There, among\r\nothers, rose, to a height of nearly 200 feet above the ground, some of\r\nthose superb coniferae, to which, in New Zealand, the natives give the\r\nname of Kauris.\r\n\r\n“I have an idea, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert. “If I were to climb to the\r\ntop of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for an immense\r\ndistance round.”\r\n\r\n“The idea is good,” replied the reporter; “but could you climb to the\r\ntop of those giants?”\r\n\r\n“I can at least try,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\nThe light and active boy then sprang on the first branches, the\r\narrangement of which made the ascent of the kauri easy, and in a few\r\nminutes he arrived at the summit, which emerged from the immense plain\r\nof verdure.\r\n\r\nFrom this elevated situation his gaze extended over all the southern\r\nportion of the island, from Claw Cape on the southeast, to Reptile End\r\non the southwest. To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, which concealed\r\na great part of the horizon.\r\n\r\nBut Herbert, from the height of his observatory, could examine all the\r\nyet unknown portion of the island, which might have given shelter to the\r\nstrangers whose presence they suspected.\r\n\r\nThe lad looked attentively. There was nothing in sight on the sea, not\r\na sail, neither on the horizon nor near the island. However, as the bank\r\nof trees hid the shore, it was possible that a vessel, especially if\r\ndeprived of her masts, might lie close to the land and thus be invisible\r\nto Herbert.\r\n\r\nNeither in the forests of the Far West was anything to be seen. The wood\r\nformed an impenetrable screen, measuring several square miles, without a\r\nbreak or an opening. It was impossible even to follow the course of the\r\nMercy, or to ascertain in what part of the mountain it took its source.\r\nPerhaps other creeks also ran towards the west, but they could not be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nBut at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped Herbert’s sight\r\ncould he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the faintest trace of which\r\nwould be easily discernible in the pure atmosphere?\r\n\r\nFor an instant Herbert thought he could perceive a slight smoke in the\r\nwest, but a more attentive examination showed that he was mistaken. He\r\nstrained his eyes in every direction, and his sight was excellent. No,\r\ndecidedly there was nothing there.\r\n\r\nHerbert descended to the foot of the kauri, and the two sportsmen\r\nreturned to Granite House. There Cyrus Harding listened to the lad’s\r\naccount, shook his head and said nothing. It was very evident that\r\nno decided opinion could be pronounced on this question until after a\r\ncomplete exploration of the island.\r\n\r\nTwo days after--the 28th of October--another incident occurred, for\r\nwhich an explanation was again required.\r\n\r\nWhile strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite House,\r\nHerbert and Neb were fortunate enough to capture a magnificent specimen\r\nof the order of chelonia. It was a turtle of the species Midas, the\r\nedible green turtle, so called from the color both of its shell and fat.\r\n\r\nHerbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the rocks\r\nto reach the sea.\r\n\r\n“Help, Neb, help!” he cried.\r\n\r\nNeb ran up.\r\n\r\n“What a fine animal!” said Neb; “but how are we to catch it?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is easier, Neb,” replied Herbert. “We have only to turn the\r\nturtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away. Take your spear and\r\ndo as I do.”\r\n\r\nThe reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace and\r\nplastron. They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was motionless as\r\na rock.\r\n\r\nHerbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal, and by\r\ntheir united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back.\r\nThe turtle, which was three feet in length, would have weighed at least\r\nfour hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n“Capital!” cried Neb; “this is something which will rejoice friend\r\nPencroft’s heart.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be rejoiced,\r\nfor the flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack-grass, is extremely\r\nsavory. At this moment the creature’s head could be seen, which was\r\nsmall, flat, but widened behind by the large temporal fossae hidden\r\nunder the long roof.\r\n\r\n“And now, what shall we do with our prize?” said Neb. “We can’t drag it\r\nto Granite House!”\r\n\r\n“Leave it here, since it cannot turn over,” replied Herbert, “and we\r\nwill come back with the cart to fetch it.”\r\n\r\n“That is the best plan.”\r\n\r\nHowever, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which Neb\r\ndeemed superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones; after\r\nwhich the two hunters returned to Granite House, following the beach,\r\nwhich the tide had left uncovered. Herbert, wishing to surprise\r\nPencroft, said nothing about the “superb specimen of a chelonian” which\r\nthey had turned over on the sand; but, two hours later, he and Neb\r\nreturned with the cart to the place where they had left it. The “superb\r\nspecimen of a chelonian” was no longer there!\r\n\r\nNeb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared about them.\r\nIt was just at this spot that the turtle had been left. The lad even\r\nfound the stones which he had used, and therefore he was certain of not\r\nbeing mistaken.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Neb, “these beasts can turn themselves over, then?’’\r\n\r\n“It appears so,” replied Herbert, who could not understand it at all,\r\nand was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand.\r\n\r\n“Well, Pencroft will be disgusted!”\r\n\r\n“And Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this\r\ndisappearance,” thought Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Neb, who wished to hide his ill-luck, “we won’t speak\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\nAnd the two, taking the cart, which there was now no use for, returned\r\nto Granite House.\r\n\r\nArrived at the dockyard, where the engineer and the sailor were working\r\ntogether, Herbert recounted what had happened.\r\n\r\n“Oh! the stupids!” cried the sailor, “to have let at least fifty meals\r\nescape!”\r\n\r\n“But, Pencroft,” replied Neb, “it wasn’t our fault that the beast got\r\naway; as I tell you, we had turned it over on its back!”\r\n\r\n“Then you didn’t turn it over enough!” returned the obstinate sailor.\r\n\r\n“Not enough!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\nAnd he told how he had taken care to wedge up the turtle with stones.\r\n\r\n“It is a miracle, then!” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“I thought, captain,” said Herbert, “that turtles, once placed on their\r\nbacks, could not regain their feet, especially when they are of a large\r\nsize?’\r\n\r\n“That is true, my boy,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Then how did it manage?”\r\n\r\n“At what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle?” asked\r\nthe engineer, who, having suspended his work, was reflecting on this\r\nincident.\r\n\r\n“Fifteen feet at the most,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“And the tide was low at the time?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, captain.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the engineer, “what the turtle could not do on the sand\r\nit might have been able to do in the water. It turned over when the tide\r\novertook it, and then quietly returned to the deep sea.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! what stupids we were!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“That is precisely what I had the honor of telling you before!” returned\r\nthe sailor.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding had given this explanation, which, no doubt, was\r\nadmissible. But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this\r\nexplanation? It cannot be said that he was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of October the bark canoe was entirely finished. Pencroft\r\nhad kept his promise, and a light boat, the shell of which was joined\r\ntogether by the flexible twigs of the crejimba, had been constructed in\r\nfive days. A seat in the stern, a second seat in the middle to preserve\r\nthe equilibrium, a third seat in the bows, rowlocks for the two oars, a\r\nscull to steer with, completed the little craft, which was twelve feet\r\nlong, and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds. The operation of\r\nlaunching it was extremely simple. The canoe was carried to the beach\r\nand laid on the sand before Granite House, and the rising tide floated\r\nit. Pencroft, who leaped in directly, maneuvered it with the scull and\r\ndeclared it to be just the thing for the purpose to which they wished to\r\nput it.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate thus his\r\nown triumph. “With this we could go round--”\r\n\r\n“The world?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No, the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast and a sail, which the\r\ncaptain will make for us some day, and we shall go splendidly! Well,\r\ncaptain--and you, Mr. Spilett; and you, Herbert; and you, Neb--aren’t\r\nyou coming to try our new vessel? Come along! we must see if it will\r\ncarry all five of us!”\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a trial which ought to be made. Pencroft soon brought\r\nthe canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks, and it was\r\nagreed that they should make a trial of the boat that day by following\r\nthe shore as far as the first point at which the rocks of the south\r\nended.\r\n\r\nAs they embarked, Neb cried,--\r\n\r\n“But your boat leaks rather, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“That’s nothing, Neb,” replied the sailor; “the wood will get seasoned.\r\nIn two days there won’t be a single leak, and our boat will have no more\r\nwater in her than there is in the stomach of a drunkard. Jump in!”\r\n\r\nThey were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off. The weather was\r\nmagnificent, the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within\r\nthe narrow limits of a lake. Thus the boat could proceed with as much\r\nsecurity as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nNeb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft remained in\r\nthe stern in order to use the scull.\r\n\r\nThe sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the southern\r\npoint of the islet. A light breeze blew from the south. No roughness was\r\nfound either in the channel or the green sea. A long swell, which the\r\ncanoe scarcely felt, as it was heavily laden, rolled regularly over the\r\nsurface of the water. They pulled out about half a mile distant from the\r\nshore, that they might have a good view of Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\nPencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river. The boat\r\nthen skirted the shore, which, extending to the extreme point, hid all\r\nTadorn’s Fens.\r\n\r\nThis point, of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of\r\nthe coast, was nearly three miles from the Mercy. The settlers resolved\r\nto go to its extremity, and only go beyond it as much as was necessary\r\nto take a rapid survey of the coast as far as Claw Cape.\r\n\r\nThe canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks\r\nwhich fringed it, and which the rising tide began to cover. The cliff\r\ngradually sloped away from the mouth of the river to the point. This was\r\nformed of granite rocks, capriciously distributed, very different from\r\nthe cliff at Prospect Heights, and of an extremely wild aspect. It might\r\nhave been said that an immense cartload of rocks had been emptied out\r\nthere. There was no vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected\r\ntwo miles from the forest, and it thus represented a giant’s arm\r\nstretched out from a leafy sleeve.\r\n\r\nThe canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without difficulty. Gideon\r\nSpilett, pencil in one hand and notebook in the other, sketched the\r\ncoast in bold strokes. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while\r\nexamining this part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in\r\nproportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible\r\nCapes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely.\r\n\r\nAs to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by the\r\nmistrust which his look expressed, it appeared that he was examining\r\nsome strange country.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, after a voyage of three-quarters of an hour, the\r\ncanoe reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was preparing to\r\nreturn, when Herbert, rising, pointed to a black object, saying,--\r\n\r\n“What do I see down there on the beach?”\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned towards the point indicated.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the reporter, “there is something. It looks like part of a\r\nwreck half buried in the sand.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Pencroft, “I see what it is!”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Barrels, barrels, which perhaps are full,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Pull to the shore, Pencroft!” said Cyrus.\r\n\r\nA few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek, and its\r\npassengers leaped on shore.\r\n\r\nPencroft was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried in the\r\nsand, but still firmly attached to a large chest, which, sustained by\r\nthem, had floated to the moment when it stranded on the beach.\r\n\r\n“There has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island,” said\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“Evidently,” replied Spilett.\r\n\r\n“But what’s in this chest?” cried Pencroft, with very natural\r\nimpatience. “What’s in this chest? It is shut up, and nothing to open it\r\nwith! Well, perhaps a stone--”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one of the\r\nsides of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand.\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” said he, “can you restrain your impatience for one hour\r\nonly?”\r\n\r\n“But, captain, just think! Perhaps there is everything we want in\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n“We shall find that out, Pencroft,” replied the engineer; “but trust\r\nto me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us. We must\r\nconvey it to Granite House, where we can open it easily, and without\r\nbreaking it. It is quite prepared for a voyage; and since it has floated\r\nhere, it may just as well float to the mouth of the river.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s advice was good. In fact, the canoe probably would not\r\nhave been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest,\r\nwhich doubtless was heavy, since two empty barrels were required to buoy\r\nit up. It was, therefore, much better to tow it to the beach at Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nAnd now, whence had this chest come? That was the important question.\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions looked attentively around them, and\r\nexamined the shore for several hundred steps. No other articles or\r\npieces of wreck could be found. Herbert and Neb climbed a high rock\r\nto survey the sea, but there was nothing in sight--neither a dismasted\r\nvessel nor a ship under sail.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps this\r\nincident was connected with that of the bullet? Perhaps strangers had\r\nlanded on another part of the island? Perhaps they were still there?\r\nBut the thought which came naturally to the settlers was, that these\r\nstrangers could not be Malay pirates, for the chest was evidently of\r\nAmerican or European make.\r\n\r\nAll the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually large\r\nsize. It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered with\r\na thick hide, which was secured by copper nails. The two great barrels,\r\nhermetically sealed, but which sounded hollow and empty, were fastened\r\nto its sides by strong ropes, knotted with a skill which Pencroft\r\ndirectly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit. It appeared to be in a\r\nperfect state of preservation, which was explained by the fact that it\r\nhad stranded on a sandy beach, and not among rocks. They had no doubt\r\nwhatever, on examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the\r\nwater, and that its arrival on this coast was recent. The water did\r\nnot appear to have penetrated to the inside, and the articles which it\r\ncontained were no doubt uninjured.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some\r\ndismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the hope\r\nthat it would reach the land, where they might afterwards find it,\r\nthe passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means of this\r\nfloating apparatus.\r\n\r\n“We will tow this chest to Granite House,” said the engineer, “where we\r\ncan make an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the\r\nsurvivors from the supposed wreck, we can return it to those to whom it\r\nbelongs. If we find no one--”\r\n\r\n“We will keep it for ourselves!” cried Pencroft. “But what in the world\r\ncan there be in it?”\r\n\r\nThe sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide would\r\nevidently float it. One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was\r\npartly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with\r\nthe canoe. Pencroft and Neb then dug away the sand with their oars, so\r\nas to facilitate the moving of the chest, towing which the boat soon\r\nbegan to double the point, to which the name of Flotsam Point was given.\r\n\r\nThe chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to keep\r\nit above water. The sailor also feared every instant that it would get\r\nloose and sink to the bottom of the sea. But happily his fears were not\r\nrealized, and an hour and a half after they set out--all that time had\r\nbeen taken up in going a distance of three miles--the boat touched the\r\nbeach below Granite House.\r\n\r\nCanoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the tide was\r\nthen going out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb, hurrying home,\r\nbrought back some tools with which to open the chest in such a way that\r\nit might be injured as little as possible, and they proceeded to its\r\ninventory. Pencroft did not try to hide that he was greatly excited.\r\n\r\nThe sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in good\r\ncondition, would of course be of use. Then the locks were forced with a\r\ncold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back. A second casing of zinc\r\nlined the interior of the chest, which had been evidently arranged\r\nthat the articles which it enclosed might under any circumstances be\r\nsheltered from damp.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Neb, “suppose it’s jam!\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\n“If only there was--” said the sailor in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Neb, who overheard him.\r\n\r\n“Nothing!”\r\n\r\nThe covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides of the\r\nchest, and by degrees numerous articles of very varied character were\r\nproduced and strewn about on the sand. At each new object Pencroft\r\nuttered fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced up and\r\ndown. There were books which made Herbert wild with joy, and cooking\r\nutensils which Neb covered with kisses!\r\n\r\nIn short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied, for this\r\nchest contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, books; and this\r\nis the exact list of them as stated in Gideon Spilett’s note-book:\r\n--Tools:--3 knives with several blades, 2 woodmen’s axes, 2 carpenter’s\r\nhatchets, 3 planes, 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6 chisels, 2 files,\r\n3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of\r\ndifferent sizes, 2 boxes of needles.\r\n\r\nWeapons:--2 flint-lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2 breach-loader\r\ncarbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels of powder, each\r\ncontaining twenty-five pounds; 12 boxes of percussion caps.\r\n\r\nInstruments:--1 sextant, 1 double opera-glass, 1 telescope, 1 box of\r\nmathematical instruments, 1 mariner’s compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer,\r\n1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus,\r\nobject-glass, plates, chemicals, etc.\r\n\r\nClothes:--2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but\r\nevidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.\r\n\r\nUtensils:--1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal\r\nplates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives.\r\n\r\nBooks:--1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different Polynesian\r\nidioms, 1 dictionary of natural science, in six volumes; 3 reams of\r\nwhite paper, 2 books with blank pages.\r\n\r\n“It must be allowed,” said the reporter, after the inventory had been\r\nmade, “that the owner of this chest was a practical man! Tools, weapons,\r\ninstruments, clothes, utensils, books--nothing is wanting! It might\r\nreally be said that he expected to be wrecked, and had prepared for it\r\nbeforehand.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is wanting, indeed,” murmured Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“And for a certainty,” added Herbert, “the vessel which carried this\r\nchest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!”\r\n\r\n“Unless,” said Pencroft, “the owner had been taken prisoner by\r\npirates--”\r\n\r\n“That is not admissible,” replied the reporter. “It is more probable\r\nthat an American or European vessel has been driven into this quarter,\r\nand that her passengers, wishing to save necessaries at least, prepared\r\nthis chest and threw it overboard.”\r\n\r\n“Is that your opinion, captain?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer, “that may have been the case. It\r\nis possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a wreck, they\r\ncollected into this chest different articles of the greatest use in\r\nhopes of finding it again on the coast--”\r\n\r\n“Even the photographic box!” exclaimed the sailor incredulously.\r\n\r\n“As to that apparatus,” replied Harding, “I do not quite see the use of\r\nit; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant ammunition\r\nwould have been more valuable to us as well as to any other castaways!”\r\n\r\n“But isn’t there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools, or\r\nbooks, which would tell us something about them?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\nThat might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined,\r\nespecially the books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons nor\r\nthe instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of the\r\nmaker; they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not appear to\r\nhave been used. The same peculiarity marked the tools and utensils; all\r\nwere new, which proved that the articles had not been taken by chance\r\nand thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary, that the choice of\r\nthings had been well considered and arranged with care. This was also\r\nindicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from\r\ndamp, and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste.\r\n\r\nAs to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms, both\r\nwere English; but they neither bore the name of the publisher nor the\r\ndate of publication.\r\n\r\nThe same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto, remarkable from a\r\ntypographic point of view, and which appeared to have been often used.\r\n\r\nThe atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every country in\r\nthe world, and several planispheres arranged upon Mercator’s projection,\r\nand of which the nomenclature was in French--but which also bore neither\r\ndate nor name of publisher.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by which\r\nthey could be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to show the\r\nnationality of the vessel which must have recently passed these shores.\r\n\r\nBut, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure to the\r\nsettlers on Lincoln Island. Till then, by making use of the productions\r\nof nature, they had created everything for themselves, and, thanks to\r\ntheir intelligence, they had managed without difficulty. But did it not\r\nappear as if Providence had wished to reward them by sending them these\r\nproductions of human industry? Their thanks rose unanimously to Heaven.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft. It\r\nappeared that the chest did not contain something which he evidently\r\nheld in great esteem, for in proportion as they approached the bottom\r\nof the box, his hurrahs diminished in heartiness, and, the inventory\r\nfinished, he was heard to mutter these words:--“That’s all very fine,\r\nbut you can see that there is nothing for me in that box!”\r\n\r\nThis led Neb to say,--\r\n\r\n“Why, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?”\r\n\r\n“Half a pound of tobacco,” replied Pencroft seriously, “and nothing\r\nwould have been wanting to complete my happiness!”\r\n\r\nNo one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor’s.\r\n\r\nBut the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was now more\r\nthan ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly. It was therefore\r\nagreed that the next morning at break of day, they should set out, by\r\nascending the Mercy so as to reach the western shore. If any castaways\r\nhad landed on the coast, it was to be feared they were without\r\nresources, and it was therefore the more necessary to carry help to them\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the different articles were carried to Granite House,\r\nwhere they were methodically arranged in the great hall. This day--the\r\n29th of October--happened to be a Sunday, and, before going to bed,\r\nHerbert asked the engineer if he would not read them something from the\r\nGospel.\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nHe took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when Pencroft\r\nstopped him, saying,--“Captain, I am superstitious. Open at random\r\nand read the first verse which, your eye falls upon. We will see if it\r\napplies to our situation.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding smiled at the sailor’s idea, and, yielding to his wish, he\r\nopened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker.\r\n\r\nImmediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with a\r\npencil, was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh chapter of\r\nthe Gospel of St. Matthew. He read the verse, which was this:--\r\n\r\n“For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the proposed\r\nexploring expedition, which recent events had rendered so necessary. In\r\nfact, things had so come about that the settlers in Lincoln Island no\r\nlonger needed help for themselves, but were even able to carry it to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far as\r\nthe river was navigable. A great part of the distance would thus be\r\ntraversed without fatigue, and the explorers could transport their\r\nprovisions and arms to an advanced point in the west of the island.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to think not only of the things which they should take\r\nwith them, but also of those which they might have by chance to bring\r\nback to Granite House. If there had been a wreck on the coast, as was\r\nsupposed, there would be many things cast up, which would be lawfully\r\ntheir prizes. In the event of this, the cart would have been of more use\r\nthan the light canoe, but it was heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore\r\nmore difficult to use; this led Pencroft to express his regret that the\r\nchest had not contained, besides “his halfpound of tobacco,” a pair\r\nof strong New Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the\r\ncolony!\r\n\r\nThe provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a store\r\nof meat and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough to sustain\r\nthem for three days, the time which Harding assigned for the expedition.\r\nThey hoped besides to supply themselves on the road, and Neb took care\r\nnot to forget the portable stove.\r\n\r\nThe only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen’s axes, which\r\nthey could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as also the\r\ninstruments, the telescope and pocket-compass.\r\n\r\nFor weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were likely\r\nto be more useful to them than the percussion fowling-pieces, the first\r\nonly requiring flints which could be easily replaced, and the latter\r\nneeding fulminating caps, a frequent use of which would soon exhaust\r\ntheir limited stock. However, they took also one of the carbines and\r\nsome cartridges. As to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds\r\nin the barrel, a small supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer\r\nhoped to manufacture an explosive substance which would allow them to\r\nhusband it. To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well sheathed\r\nin leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture into the vast\r\nforest with some chance of success.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus armed, were\r\nat the summit of their happiness, although Cyrus Harding made them\r\npromise not to fire a shot unless it was necessary.\r\n\r\nAt six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had\r\nembarked, including Top, and they proceeded to the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nThe tide had begun to come up half an hour before. For several hours,\r\ntherefore, there would be a current, which it was well to profit by, for\r\nlater the ebb would make it difficult to ascend the river. The tide was\r\nalready strong, for in three days the moon would be full, and it was\r\nenough to keep the boat in the center of the current, where it floated\r\nswiftly along between the high banks without its being necessary\r\nto increase its speed by the aid of the oars. In a few minutes the\r\nexplorers arrived at the angle formed by the Mercy and exactly at the\r\nplace where, seven months before, Pencroft had made his first raft of\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nAfter this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of\r\ngreat evergreen firs.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the banks was magnificent. Cyrus Harding and his\r\ncompanions could not but admire the lovely effects so easily produced\r\nby nature with water and trees. As they advanced the forest element\r\ndiminished. On the right bank of the river grew magnificent specimens of\r\nthe ulmaceae tribe, the precious elm, so valuable to builders, and which\r\nwithstands well the action of water. Then there were numerous groups\r\nbelonging to the same family, among others one in particular, the fruit\r\nof which produces a very useful oil. Further on, Herbert remarked the\r\nlardizabala, a twining shrub which, when bruised in water, furnishes\r\nexcellent cordage; and two or three ebony trees of a beautiful black,\r\ncrossed with capricious veins.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy, the\r\ncanoe was stopped, when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft, their\r\nguns in their hands, and preceded by Top, jumped on shore. Without\r\nexpecting game, some useful plant might be met with, and the young\r\nnaturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach,\r\nbelonging to the order of chenopodiaceae, and numerous specimens of\r\ncruciferae, belonging to the cabbage tribe, which it would certainly be\r\npossible to cultivate by transplanting. There were cresses, horseradish,\r\nturnips, and lastly, little branching hairy stalks, scarcely more than\r\nthree feet high, which produced brownish grains.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what this plant is?” asked Herbert of the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Tobacco!” cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his favorite\r\nplant except in the bowl of his pipe.\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft,” replied Herbert; “this is not tobacco, it is mustard.”\r\n\r\n“Mustard be hanged!” returned the sailor; “but if by chance you happen\r\nto come across a tobacco-plant, my boy, pray don’t scorn that!”\r\n\r\n“We shall find it some day!” said Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Well!” exclaimed Pencroft, “when that day comes, I do not know what\r\nmore will be wanting in our island!”\r\n\r\nThese different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were carried\r\nto the canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in thought.\r\n\r\nThe reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently\r\ndisembarked, sometimes on the right bank, sometimes on the left bank of\r\nthe Mercy.\r\n\r\nThe latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The engineer\r\nascertained by consulting his pocket-compass that the direction of the\r\nriver from the first turn was obviously southwest and northeast, and\r\nnearly straight for a length of about three miles. But it was to be\r\nsupposed that this direction changed beyond that point, and that the\r\nMercy continued to the north-west, towards the spurs of Mount Franklin,\r\namong which the river rose.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get hold\r\nof two couples of living gallinaceae. They were birds with long, thin\r\nbeaks, lengthened necks, short wings, and without any appearance of\r\na tail. Herbert rightly gave them the name of tinamous, and it\r\nwas resolved that they should be the first tenants of their future\r\npoultry-yard.\r\n\r\nBut till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report which awoke\r\nthe echoes of the forest of the Far West was provoked by the appearance\r\nof a beautiful bird, resembling the kingfisher.\r\n\r\n“I recognize him!” cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went off\r\nby itself.\r\n\r\n“What do you recognize?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“The bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from which we\r\ngave the name to that part of the forest.”\r\n\r\n“A jacamar!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a metallic\r\nluster. A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried it to the\r\ncanoe. At the same time half a dozen lories were brought down. The lory\r\nis of the size of a pigeon, the plumage dashed with green, part of\r\nthe wings crimson, and its crest bordered with white. To the young boy\r\nbelonged the honor of this shot, and he was proud enough of it. Lories\r\nare better food than the jacamar, the flesh of which is rather tough,\r\nbut it was difficult to persuade Pencroft that he had not killed the\r\nking of eatable birds. It was ten o’clock in the morning when the canoe\r\nreached a second angle of the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth.\r\nHere a halt was made for breakfast under the shade of some splendid\r\ntrees. The river still measured from sixty to seventy feet in breadth,\r\nand its bed from five to six feet in depth. The engineer had observed\r\nthat it was increased by numerous affluents, but they were unnavigable,\r\nbeing simply little streams. As to the forest, including Jacamar Wood,\r\nas well as the forests of the Far West, it extended as far as the eye\r\ncould reach. In no place, either in the depths of the forests or under\r\nthe trees on the banks of the Mercy, was the presence of man revealed.\r\nThe explorers could not discover one suspicious trace. It was evident\r\nthat the woodman’s axe had never touched these trees, that the pioneer’s\r\nknife had never severed the creepers hanging from one trunk to another\r\nin the midst of tangled brushwood and long grass. If castaways had\r\nlanded on the island, they could not have yet quitted the shore, and it\r\nwas not in the woods that the survivors of the supposed shipwreck should\r\nbe sought.\r\n\r\nThe engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the western\r\ncoast of Lincoln Island, which was at least five miles distant according\r\nto his estimation.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not towards\r\nthe shore, but rather towards Mount Franklin, it was decided that they\r\nshould use the boat as long as there was enough water under its keel\r\nto float it. It was both fatigue spared and time gained, for they would\r\nhave been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes.\r\nBut soon the flow completely failed them, either the tide was going\r\ndown, and it was about the hour, or it could no longer be felt at this\r\ndistance from the mouth of the Mercy. They had therefore to make use of\r\nthe oars. Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the scull.\r\nThe forest soon became less dense, the trees grew further apart and\r\noften quite isolated. But the further they were from each other the more\r\nmagnificent they appeared, profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air\r\nwhich circulated around them.\r\n\r\nWhat splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude! Certainly\r\ntheir presence would have been enough for a botanist to name without\r\nhesitation the parallel which traversed Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n“Eucalypti!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\nThey were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the\r\nextratropical zone, the congeners of the Australian and New Zealand\r\neucalyptus, both situated under the same latitude as Lincoln Island.\r\nSome rose to a height of two hundred feet. Their trunks at the base\r\nmeasured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark was covered by a\r\nnetwork of farrows containing a red, sweet-smelling gum. Nothing is more\r\nwonderful or more singular than those enormous specimens of the order of\r\nthe myrtaceae, with their leaves placed vertically and not horizontally,\r\nso that an edge and not a surface looks upwards, the effect being that\r\nthe sun’s rays penetrate more freely among the trees.\r\n\r\nThe ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass, and\r\nfrom the bushes escaped flights of little birds, which glittered in the\r\nsunlight like winged rubies.\r\n\r\n“These are something like trees!” cried Neb; “but are they good for\r\nanything?”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” replied Pencroft. “Of course there are vegetable giants as well\r\nas human giants, and they are no good, except to show themselves at\r\nfairs!”\r\n\r\n“I think that you are mistaken, Pencroft,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and\r\nthat the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously\r\nemployed in cabinet-making.”\r\n\r\n“And I may add,” said Herbert, “that the eucalyptus belongs to a family\r\nwhich comprises many useful members; the guava-tree, from whose fruit\r\nguava jelly is made; the clove-tree, which produces the spice; the\r\npomegranate-tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia Cauliflora,\r\nthe fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle,\r\nwhich contains an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle,\r\nof which the bark forms an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from\r\nwhence comes Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle, from whose buds and\r\nberries spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields\r\na sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is\r\ntransformed into beer by fermentation; in short, all those trees known\r\nunder the name of gum-trees or iron-bark trees in Australia, belong\r\nto this family of the myrtaceae, which contains forty-six genera and\r\nthirteen hundred species!”\r\n\r\nThe lad was allowed to run on, and he delivered his little botanical\r\nlecture with great animation. Cyrus Harding listened smiling, and\r\nPencroft with an indescribable feeling of pride.\r\n\r\n“Very good, Herbert,” replied Pencroft, “but I could swear that all\r\nthose useful specimens you have just told us about are none of them\r\ngiants like these!”\r\n\r\n“That is true, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“That supports what I said,” returned the sailor, “namely, that these\r\ngiants are good for nothing!”\r\n\r\n“There you are wrong, Pencroft,” said the engineer; “these gigantic\r\neucalypti, which shelter us, are good for something.”\r\n\r\n“And what is that?”\r\n\r\n“To render the countries which they inhabit healthy. Do you know what\r\nthey are called in Australia and New Zealand?”\r\n\r\n“No, captain.”\r\n\r\n“They are called ‘fever trees.’”\r\n\r\n“Because they give fevers?”\r\n\r\n“No, because they prevent them!”\r\n\r\n“Good. I must note that,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Note it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the presence\r\nof the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas. This natural antidote\r\nhas been tried in certain countries in the middle of Europe and the\r\nnorth of Africa where the soil was absolutely unhealthy, and the\r\nsanitary condition of the inhabitants has been gradually ameliorated. No\r\nmore intermittent fevers prevail in the regions now covered with forests\r\nof the myrtaceae. This fact is now beyond doubt, and it is a happy\r\ncircumstance for us settlers in Lincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! what an island! What a blessed island!” cried Pencroft. “I tell\r\nyou, it wants nothing--unless it is--”\r\n\r\n“That will come, Pencroft, that will be found,” replied the engineer;\r\n“but now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river\r\nwill carry our boat!”\r\n\r\nThe exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the\r\nmidst of country covered with eucalypti, which predominated in the woods\r\nof this portion of the island. The space which they occupied extended as\r\nfar as the eye could reach on each side of the Mercy, which wound along\r\nbetween high green banks. The bed was often obstructed by long weeds,\r\nand even by pointed rocks, which rendered the navigation very difficult.\r\nThe action of the oars was prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to push\r\nwith a pole. They found also that the water was becoming shallower\r\nand shallower, and that the canoe must soon stop. The sun was already\r\nsinking towards the horizon, and the trees threw long shadows on the\r\nground. Cyrus Harding, seeing that he could not hope to reach the\r\nwestern coast of the island in one journey, resolved to camp at the\r\nplace where any further navigation was prevented by want of water. He\r\ncalculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast, and\r\nthis distance was too great for them to attempt during the night in the\r\nmidst of unknown woods.\r\n\r\nThe boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually became\r\nthicker again, and appeared also to have more inhabitants; for if the\r\neyes of the sailor did not deceive him, he thought he saw bands of\r\nmonkeys springing among the trees. Sometimes even two or three of these\r\nanimals stopped at a little distance from the canoe and gazed at the\r\nsettlers without manifesting any terror, as if, seeing men for the first\r\ntime, they had not yet learned to fear them. It would have been easy\r\nto bring down one of these quadramani with a gunshot, and Pencroft was\r\ngreatly tempted to fire, but Harding opposed so useless a massacre.\r\nThis was prudent, for the monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very\r\npowerful and extremely active, it was useless to provoke an unnecessary\r\naggression, and the creatures might, ignorant of the power of the\r\nexplorers’ firearms, have attacked them. It is true that the sailor\r\nconsidered the monkeys from a purely alimentary point of view, for those\r\nanimals which are herbivorous make very excellent game; but since they\r\nhad an abundant supply of provisions, it was a pity to waste their\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nTowards four o’clock, the navigation of the Mercy became exceedingly\r\ndifficult, for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks.\r\nThe banks rose higher and higher, and already they were approaching the\r\nspurs of Mount Franklin. The source could not be far off, since it was\r\nfed by the water from the southern slopes of the mountain.\r\n\r\n“In a quarter of an hour,” said the sailor, “we shall be obliged to\r\nstop, captain.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our encampment for\r\nthe night.”\r\n\r\n“At what distance are we from Granite House?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“About seven miles,” replied the engineer, “taking into calculation,\r\nhowever, the detours of the river, which has carried us to the\r\nnorthwest.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we go on?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, as long as we can,” replied Cyrus Harding. “To-morrow, at break of\r\nday, we will leave the canoe, and in two hours I hope we shall cross the\r\ndistance which separates us from the coast, and then we shall have the\r\nwhole day in which to explore the shore.”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead!” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\nBut soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which was\r\nnow not more than twenty feet in breadth. The trees met like a bower\r\noverhead, and caused a half-darkness. They also heard the noise of a\r\nwaterfall, which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a\r\nnatural barrier.\r\n\r\nPresently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared through\r\nthe trees. The canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few minutes it\r\nwas moored to a trunk near the right bank.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly five o’clock. The last rays of the sun gleamed through\r\nthe thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall, making the spray\r\nsparkle with all the colors of the rainbow. Beyond that, the Mercy was\r\nlost in the bushwood, where it was fed from some hidden source. The\r\ndifferent streams which flowed into it increased it to a regular river\r\nfurther down, but here it was simply a shallow, limpid brook.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming. The colonists\r\ndisembarked, and a fire was soon lighted under a clump of trees, among\r\nthe branches of which Cyrus Harding and his companions could, if it was\r\nnecessary, take refuge for the night.\r\n\r\nSupper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there\r\nwas only sleeping to think of. But, as roarings of rather a suspicious\r\nnature had been heard during the evening, a good fire was made up for\r\nthe night, so as to protect the sleepers with its crackling flames. Neb\r\nand Pencroft also watched by turns, and did not spare fuel. They thought\r\nthey saw the dark forms of some wild animals prowling round the camp\r\namong the bushes, but the night passed without incident, and the next\r\nday, the 31st of October, at five o’clock in the morning, all were on\r\nfoot, ready for a start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nIt was six o’ clock in the morning when the settlers, after a hasty\r\nbreakfast, set out to reach by the shortest way, the western coast of\r\nthe island. And how long would it take to do this? Cyrus Harding\r\nhad said two hours, but of course that depended on the nature of the\r\nobstacles they might meet with. As it was probable that they would have\r\nto cut a path through the grass, shrubs, and creepers, they marched axe\r\nin hand, and with guns also ready, wisely taking warning from the cries\r\nof the wild beasts heard in the night.\r\n\r\nThe exact position of the encampment could be determined by the bearing\r\nof Mount Franklin, and as the volcano arose in the north at a distance\r\nof less than three miles, they had only to go straight towards the\r\nsouthwest to reach the western coast. They set out, having first\r\ncarefully secured the canoe. Pencroft and Neb carried sufficient\r\nprovision for the little band for at least two days. It would not thus\r\nbe necessary to hunt. The engineer advised his companions to refrain\r\nfrom firing, that their presence might not be betrayed to any one near\r\nthe shore. The first hatchet blows were given among the brushwood in the\r\nmidst of some mastic-trees, a little above the cascade; and his compass\r\nin his hand, Cyrus Harding led the way.\r\n\r\nThe forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had\r\nalready been met with near the lake and on Prospect Heights. There\r\nwere deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, gum trees, eucalypti, hibiscus,\r\ncedars, and other trees, generally of a moderate size, for their number\r\nprevented their growth.\r\n\r\nSince their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes which\r\nconstituted the mountain system of the island, on to a dry soil, but the\r\nluxuriant vegetation of which indicated it to be watered either by some\r\nsubterranean marsh or by some stream. However, Cyrus Harding did not\r\nremember having seen, at the time of his excursion to the crater, any\r\nother watercourses but the Red Creek and the Mercy.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous troops of\r\nmonkeys who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of men, whose\r\nappearance was so new to them. Gideon Spilett jokingly asked whether\r\nthese active and merry quadrupeds did not consider him and his\r\ncompanions as degenerate brothers.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly, pedestrians, hindered at each step by bushes, caught by\r\ncreepers, barred by trunks of trees, did not shine beside those supple\r\nanimals, who, bounding from branch to branch, were hindered by nothing\r\non their course. The monkeys were numerous, but happily they did not\r\nmanifest any hostile disposition.\r\n\r\nSeveral pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen, also two\r\nor three koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a shot.\r\n\r\n“But,” said he, “you may jump and play just now; we shall have one or\r\ntwo words to say to you on our way back!”\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown\r\nstream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed\r\nfoaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted its course. This creek\r\nwas deep and clear, but it was absolutely unnavigable.\r\n\r\n“We are cut off!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Herbert, “it is only a stream, and we can easily swim\r\nover.”\r\n\r\n“What would be the use of that?” returned Harding. “This creek evidently\r\nruns to the sea. Let us remain on this side and follow the bank, and\r\nI shall be much astonished if it does not lead us very quickly to the\r\ncoast. Forward!”\r\n\r\n“One minute,” said the reporter. “The name of this creek, my friends? Do\r\nnot let us leave our geography incomplete.”\r\n\r\n“All right!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Name it, my boy,” said the engineer, addressing the lad.\r\n\r\n“Will it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its mouth?”\r\n answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied Cyrus Harding. “Let us follow it as fast as we can\r\nwithout stopping.”\r\n\r\n“Still another minute!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Though hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,” said the\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n“We have no time to lose,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Oh! five minutes!” replied Pencroft, “I only ask for five minutes to\r\nuse in the interest of our breakfast!”\r\n\r\nAnd Pencroft, lying down on the bank, plunged his arm into the water,\r\nand soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stones.\r\n\r\n“These will be good!” cried Neb, going to the sailor’s aid.\r\n\r\n“As I said, there is everything in this island, except tobacco!”\r\n muttered Pencroft with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThe fishing did not take five minutes, for the crayfish were swarming in\r\nthe creek. A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose shells were of a\r\ncobalt blue. The settlers then pushed on.\r\n\r\nThey advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than\r\nin the forest. From time to time they came upon the traces of animals of\r\na large size who had come to quench their thirst at the stream, but none\r\nwere actually seen, and it was evidently not in this part of the forest\r\nthat the peccary had received the bullet which had cost Pencroft a\r\ngrinder.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, considering the rapid current, Harding was led to\r\nsuppose that he and his companions were much farther from the western\r\ncoast than they had at first supposed. In fact, at this hour, the rising\r\ntide would have turned back the current of the creek, if its mouth had\r\nonly been a few miles distant. Now, this effect was not produced, and\r\nthe water pursued its natural course. The engineer was much astonished\r\nat this, and frequently consulted his compass, to assure himself that\r\nsome turn of the river was not leading them again into the Far West.\r\n\r\nHowever, the creek gradually widened and its waters became less\r\ntumultuous. The trees on the right bank were as close together as on the\r\nleft bank, and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them;\r\nbut these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited, for Top did not\r\nbark, and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the\r\npresence of any stranger in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten, to the great surprise of Cyrus Harding, Herbert, who\r\nwas a little in front, suddenly stopped and exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“The sea!”\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more, the whole western shore of the island lay\r\nextended before the eyes of the settlers.\r\n\r\nBut what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon which\r\nchance had first thrown them. No granite cliff, no rocks, not even a\r\nsandy beach. The forest reached the shore, and the tall trees bending\r\nover the water were beaten by the waves. It was not such a shore as is\r\nusually formed by nature, either by extending a vast carpet of sand,\r\nor by grouping masses of rock, but a beautiful border consisting of the\r\nmost splendid trees. The bank was raised a little above the level of the\r\nsea, and on this luxuriant soil, supported by a granite base, the fine\r\nforest trees seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor,\r\nwhich would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing-boats. It\r\nserved as a neck to the new creek, of which the curious thing was that\r\nits waters, instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope, fell from a\r\nheight of more than forty feet, which explained why the rising tide was\r\nnot felt up the stream. In fact, the tides of the Pacific, even at\r\ntheir maximum elevation, could never reach the level of the river, and,\r\ndoubtless, millions of years would pass before the water would have worn\r\naway the granite and hollowed a practicable mouth.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this\r\nstream. Beyond, towards the north, the forest border was prolonged for\r\na space of nearly two miles; then the trees became scarcer, and beyond\r\nthat again the picturesque heights described a nearly straight line,\r\nwhich ran north and south. On the contrary, all the part of the shore\r\nbetween Falls River and Reptile End was a mass of wood, magnificent\r\ntrees, some straight, others bent, so that the long sea-swell bathed\r\ntheir roots. Now, it was this coast, that is, all the Serpentine\r\nPeninsula, that was to be explored, for this part of the shore offered\r\na refuge to castaways, which the other wild and barren side must have\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThe weather was fine and clear, and from a height of a hillock on which\r\nNeb and Pencroft had arranged breakfast, a wide view was obtained. There\r\nwas, however, not a sail in sight; nothing could be seen along the shore\r\nas far as the eye could reach. But the engineer would take nothing for\r\ngranted until he had explored the coast to the very extremity of the\r\nSerpentine Peninsula.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was soon despatched, and at half-past eleven the captain gave\r\nthe signal for departure. Instead of proceeding over the summit of a\r\ncliff or along a sandy beach, the settlers were obliged to remain under\r\ncover of the trees so that they might continue on the shore.\r\n\r\nThe distance which separated Falls River from Reptile End was about\r\ntwelve miles. It would have taken the settlers four hours to do this,\r\non a clear ground and without hurrying themselves; but as it was they\r\nneeded double the time, for what with trees to go round, bushes to cut\r\ndown, and creepers to chop away, they were impeded at every step, these\r\nobstacles greatly lengthening their journey.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, nothing to show that a shipwreck had taken place\r\nrecently. It is true that, as Gideon Spilett observed, any remains of\r\nit might have drifted out to sea, and they must not take it for granted\r\nthat because they could find no traces of it, a ship had not been\r\ncastaway on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe reporter’s argument was just, and besides, the incident of the\r\nbullet proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln Island within\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\nIt was already five o’clock, and there were still two miles between the\r\nsettlers and the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula. It was evident\r\nthat after having reached Reptile End, Harding and his companions would\r\nnot have time to return before dark to their encampment near the source\r\nof the Mercy. It would therefore be necessary to pass the night on the\r\npromontory. But they had no lack of provisions, which was lucky, for\r\nthere were no animals on the shore, though birds, on the contrary,\r\nabound--jacamars, couroucous, tragopans, grouse, lories, parrots,\r\ncockatoos, pheasants, pigeons, and a hundred others. There was not\r\na tree without a nest, and not a nest which was not full of flapping\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nTowards seven o’clock the weary explorers arrived at Reptile End. Here\r\nthe seaside forest ended, and the shore resumed the customary appearance\r\nof a coast, with rocks, reefs, and sands. It was possible that something\r\nmight be found here, but darkness came on, and the further exploration\r\nhad to be put off to the next day.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Herbert hastened on to find a suitable place for their\r\ncamp. Among the last trees of the forest of the Far West, the boy found\r\nseveral thick clumps of bamboos.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said he; “this is a valuable discovery.”\r\n\r\n“Valuable?” returned Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Herbert. “I may say, Pencroft, that the bark of the\r\nbamboo, cut into flexible laths, is used for making baskets; that this\r\nbark, mashed into a paste, is used for the manufacture of Chinese paper;\r\nthat the stalks furnish, according to their size, canes and pipes\r\nand are used for conducting water; that large bamboos make excellent\r\nmaterial for building, being light and strong, and being never attacked\r\nby insects. I will add that by sawing the bamboo in two at the joint,\r\nkeeping for the bottom the part of the transverse film which forms\r\nthe joint, useful cups are obtained, which are much in use among the\r\nChinese. No! you don’t care for that. But--”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“But I can tell you, if you are ignorant of it, that in India these\r\nbamboos are eaten like asparagus.”\r\n\r\n“Asparagus thirty feet high!” exclaimed the sailor. “And are they good?”\r\n\r\n“Excellent,” replied Herbert. “Only it is not the stems of thirty feet\r\nhigh which are eaten, but the young shoots.”\r\n\r\n“Perfect, my boy, perfect!” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“I will also add that the pith of the young stalks, preserved in\r\nvinegar, makes a good pickle.”\r\n\r\n“Better and better, Herbert!”\r\n\r\n“And lastly, that the bamboos exude a sweet liquor which can be made\r\ninto a very agreeable drink.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“That is all!”\r\n\r\n“And they don’t happen to do for smoking?”\r\n\r\n“No, my poor Pencroft.”\r\n\r\nHerbert and the sailor had not to look long for a place in which to pass\r\nthe night. The rocks, which must have been violently beaten by the\r\nsea under the influence of the winds of the southwest, presented many\r\ncavities in which shelter could be found against the night air. But just\r\nas they were about to enter one of these caves a loud roaring arrested\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Back!” cried Pencroft. “Our guns are only loaded with small shot, and\r\nbeasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more for it than for\r\ngrains of salt!” And the sailor, seizing Herbert by the arm, dragged\r\nhim behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the\r\nentrance of the cavern.\r\n\r\nIt was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic congeners, that\r\nis to say, it measured five feet from the extremity of its head to the\r\nbeginning of its tail. The yellow color of its hair was relieved by\r\nstreaks and regular oblong spots of black, which contrasted with the\r\nwhite of its chest. Herbert recognized it as the ferocious rival of\r\nthe tiger, as formidable as the puma, which is the rival of the largest\r\nwolf!\r\n\r\nThe jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his hair\r\nbristling as if this was not the first time he had scented men.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert, thinking\r\nthat he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards him, when\r\nGideon Spilett signed to him to remain where he was. This was not his\r\nfirst tiger, and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained\r\nmotionless, his gun to his shoulder, without moving a muscle. The jaguar\r\ncollected itself for a spring, but at that moment a shot struck it in\r\nthe eyes, and it fell dead.\r\n\r\nHerbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar. Neb and Harding also ran\r\nup, and they remained for some instants contemplating the animal as it\r\nlay stretched on the ground, thinking that its magnificent skin would be\r\na great ornament to the hall at Granite House.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!” cried Herbert, in a fit of\r\nvery natural enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy,” replied the reporter, “you could have done the same.”\r\n\r\n“I! with such coolness!--”\r\n\r\n“Imagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare, and you\r\nwould fire as quietly as possible.”\r\n\r\n“That is,” rejoined Pencroft, “that it is not more dangerous than a\r\nhare!”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Gideon Spilett, “since the jaguar has left its abode, I\r\ndo not see, my friends, why we should not take possession of it for the\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“But others may come,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“It will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern,” said\r\nthe reporter, “and no wild beasts will dare to cross the threshold.”\r\n\r\n“Into the jaguar’s house, then!” replied the sailor, dragging after him\r\nthe body of the animal.\r\n\r\nWhile Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an abundant\r\nsupply of dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up at the cave.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity, which he\r\nmingled with the other fuel.\r\n\r\nThis done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was strewn with\r\nbones, the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a sudden attack, they\r\nhad supper, and then just before they lay down to rest, the heap of wood\r\npiled at the entrance was set fire to. Immediately, a regular explosion,\r\nor rather a series of reports, broke the silence! The noise was caused\r\nby the bamboos, which, as the flames reached them, exploded like\r\nfireworks. The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nIt was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud\r\nexplosions, for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have employed it\r\nfor many centuries to drive away from their encampments the formidable\r\nwild beasts of Central Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions slept like innocent marmots in the cave\r\nwhich the jaguar had so politely left at their disposal.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise all were on the shore at the extremity of the promontory, and\r\ntheir gaze was directed towards the horizon, of which two-thirds of\r\nthe circumference were visible. For the last time the engineer could\r\nascertain that not a sail nor the wreck of a ship was on the sea, and\r\neven with the telescope nothing suspicious could be discovered.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing either on the shore, at least, in the straight line\r\nof three miles which formed the south side of the promontory, for\r\nbeyond that, rising ground had the rest of the coast, and even from the\r\nextremity of the Serpentine Peninsula Claw Cape could not be seen.\r\n\r\nThe southern coast of the island still remained to be explored. Now\r\nshould they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?\r\n\r\nThis was not included in their first plan. In fact, when the boat was\r\nabandoned at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed that after\r\nhaving surveyed the west coast, they should go back to it, and return to\r\nGranite House by the Mercy. Harding then thought that the western coast\r\nwould have offered refuge, either to a ship in distress, or to a vessel\r\nin her regular course; but now, as he saw that this coast presented no\r\ngood anchorage, he wished to seek on the south what they had not been\r\nable to find on the west.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett proposed to continue the exploration, that the question\r\nof the supposed wreck might be completely settled, and he asked at what\r\ndistance Claw Cape might be from the extremity of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n“About thirty miles,” replied the engineer, “if we take into\r\nconsideration the curvings of the coast.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thirty miles!” returned Spilett. “That would be a long day’s march.\r\nNevertheless, I think that we should return to Granite House by the\r\nsouth coast.”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Herbert, “from Claw Cape to Granite House there must be\r\nat least another ten miles.\r\n\r\n“Make it forty miles in all,” replied the engineer, “and do not hesitate\r\nto do it. At least we should survey the unknown shore, and then we shall\r\nnot have to begin the exploration again.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said Pencroft. “But the boat?”\r\n\r\n“The boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of the\r\nMercy,” replied Gideon Spilett; “it may just as well stay there two\r\ndays! As yet, we have had no reason to think that the island is infested\r\nby thieves!”\r\n\r\n“Yet,” said the sailor, “when I remember the history of the turtle, I am\r\nfar from confident of that.”\r\n\r\n“The turtle! the turtle!” replied the reporter. “Don’t you know that the\r\nsea turned it over?”\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” murmured the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But,--” said Neb.\r\n\r\nNeb had evidently something to say, for he opened his mouth to speak and\r\nyet said nothing.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to say, Neb?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“If we return by the shore to Claw Cape,” replied Neb, “after having\r\ndoubled the Cape, we shall be stopped--”\r\n\r\n“By the Mercy! of course,” replied Herbert, “and we shall have neither\r\nbridge nor boat by which to cross.”\r\n\r\n“But, captain,” added Pencroft, “with a few floating trunks we shall\r\nhave no difficulty in crossing the river.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Spilett, “it will be useful to construct a bridge if\r\nwe wish to have an easy access to the Far West!”\r\n\r\n“A bridge!” cried Pencroft. “Well, is not the captain the best engineer\r\nin his profession? He will make us a bridge when we want one. As to\r\ntransporting you this evening to the other side of the Mercy, and that\r\nwithout wetting one thread of your clothes, I will take care of that. We\r\nhave provisions for another day, and besides we can get plenty of game.\r\nForward!”\r\n\r\nThe reporter’s proposal, so strongly seconded by the sailor, received\r\ngeneral approbation, for each wished to have their doubts set at rest,\r\nand by returning by Claw Cape the exploration would be ended. But there\r\nwas not an hour to lose, for forty miles was a long march, and they\r\ncould not hope to reach Granite House before night.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock in the morning the little band set out. As a precaution\r\nthe guns were loaded with ball, and Top, who led the van, received\r\norders to beat about the edge of the forest.\r\n\r\nFrom the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the\r\npeninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which\r\nwas rapidly passed over, without even the most minute investigations\r\nbringing to light the least trace of any old or recent landings; no\r\ndebris, no mark of an encampment, no cinders of a fire, nor even a\r\nfootprint!\r\n\r\nFrom the point of the peninsula on which the settlers now were their\r\ngaze could extend along the southwest. Twenty-five miles off the coast\r\nterminated in the Claw Cape, which loomed dimly through the morning\r\nmists, and which, by the phenomenon of the mirage, appeared as if\r\nsuspended between land and water.\r\n\r\nBetween the place occupied by the colonists and the other side of the\r\nimmense bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of low land,\r\nbordered in the background by trees; then the shore became more\r\nirregular, projecting sharp points into the sea, and finally ended in\r\nthe black rocks which, accumulated in picturesque disorder, formed Claw\r\nCape.\r\n\r\nSuch was the development of this part of the island, which the settlers\r\ntook in at a glance, while stopping for an instant.\r\n\r\n“If a vessel ran in here,” said Pencroft, “she would certainly be lost.\r\nSandbanks and reefs everywhere! Bad quarters!”\r\n\r\n“But at least something would be left of the ship,” observed the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\n“There might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the sands,”\r\n replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for they\r\nswallow up everything that is thrown on them. In a few days the hull of\r\na ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely in there!”\r\n\r\n“So, Pencroft,” asked the engineer, “if a ship has been wrecked on\r\nthese banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of her\r\nremaining?”\r\n\r\n“No, captain, with the aid of time and tempest. However, it would be\r\nsurprising, even in this case, that some of the masts or spars should\r\nnot have been thrown on the beach, out of reach of the waves.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go on with our search, then,” returned Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock the colonists arrived at the other side of Washington\r\nBay, they having now gone a distance of twenty miles.\r\n\r\nThey then halted for breakfast.\r\n\r\nHere began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and\r\nsandbanks. The long sea-swell could be seen breaking over the rocks in\r\nthe bay, forming a foamy fringe. From this point to Claw Cape the beach\r\nwas very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs.\r\n\r\nWalking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks which\r\nencumbered the beach. The granite cliff also gradually increased in\r\nheight, and only the green tops of the trees which crowned it could be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour’s rest, the settlers resumed their journey, and not\r\na spot among the rocks was left unexamined. Pencroft and Neb even rushed\r\ninto the surf whenever any object attracted their attention. But they\r\nfound nothing, some curious formations of the rocks having deceived\r\nthem. They ascertained, however, that eatable shellfish abounded there,\r\nbut these could not be of any great advantage to them until some easy\r\nmeans of communication had been established between the two banks of the\r\nMercy, and until the means of transport had been perfected.\r\n\r\nNothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be\r\nfound on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such as the hull\r\nof a ship, would have been seen directly, or any of her masts and spars\r\nwould have been washed on shore, just as the chest had been, which was\r\nfound twenty miles from here. But there was nothing.\r\n\r\nTowards three o’clock Harding and his companions arrived at a snug\r\nlittle creek. It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from the sea,\r\nand was entered by a narrow channel.\r\n\r\nAt the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the\r\nrocky border, and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to an upper\r\nplateau, which might be situated at least ten miles from Claw Cape, and\r\nconsequently four miles in a straight line from Prospect Heights. Gideon\r\nSpilett proposed to his companions that they should make a halt here.\r\nThey agreed readily, for their walk had sharpened their appetites;\r\nand although it was not their usual dinner-hour, no one refused to\r\nstrengthen himself with a piece of venison. This luncheon would sustain\r\nthem until their supper, which they intended to take at Granite House.\r\nIn a few minutes the settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea-pines,\r\nwere devouring the provisions which Neb produced from his bag.\r\n\r\nThis spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of the\r\nsea. The view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended in Union\r\nBay. Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible, and could not\r\nbe from thence, for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed\r\nthe northern horizon.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea which\r\nthe explorers could survey, and though the engineer swept the horizon\r\nwith his glass, no vessel could be found.\r\n\r\nThe shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the\r\nwater to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Gideon Spilett, “it seems we must make up our minds to\r\nconsole ourselves with thinking that no one will come to dispute with us\r\nthe possession of Lincoln Island!”\r\n\r\n“But the bullet,” cried Herbert. “That was not imaginary, I suppose!”\r\n\r\n“Hang it, no!” exclaimed Pencroft, thinking of his absent tooth.\r\n\r\n“Then what conclusion may be drawn?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“This,” replied the engineer, “that three months or more ago, a vessel,\r\neither voluntarily or not, came here.”\r\n\r\n“What! then you admit, Cyrus, that she was swallowed up without leaving\r\nany trace?” cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear Spilett; but you see that if it is certain that a human\r\nbeing set foot on the island, it appears no less certain that he has now\r\nleft it.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if I understand you right, captain,” said Herbert, “the vessel\r\nhas left again?”\r\n\r\n“Evidently.”\r\n\r\n“And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?” said Neb.\r\n\r\n“I fear so.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it can’t be\r\nhelped,” said Pencroft, who felt home-sickness for Granite House.\r\n\r\nBut just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and the dog\r\nissued from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled with mud.\r\n\r\nNeb seized it. It was a piece of strong cloth!\r\n\r\nTop still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite his\r\nmaster to follow him into the forest.\r\n\r\n“Now there’s something to explain the bullet!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“A castaway!” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Wounded, perhaps!” said Neb.\r\n\r\n“Or dead!” added the reporter.\r\n\r\nAll ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the forest.\r\nHarding and his companions made ready their firearms, in case of an\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThey advanced some way into the wood, but to their great disappointment,\r\nthey as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way.\r\nShrubs and creepers were uninjured, and they had even to cut them away\r\nwith the axe, as they had done in the deepest recesses of the forest.\r\nIt was difficult to fancy that any human creature had ever passed there,\r\nbut yet Top went backward and forward, not like a dog who searches at\r\nrandom, but like a dog being endowed with a mind, who is following up an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nIn about seven or eight minutes Top stopped in a glade surrounded with\r\ntall trees. The settlers gazed around them, but saw nothing, neither\r\nunder the bushes nor among the trees.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Top?” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nTop barked louder, bounding about at the foot of a gigantic pine. All at\r\nonce Pencroft shouted,--“Ho, splendid! capital!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“We have been looking for a wreck at sea or on land!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well; and here we’ve found one in the air!”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor pointed to a great white rag, caught in the top of the\r\npine, a fallen scrap of which the dog had brought to them.\r\n\r\n“But that is not a wreck!” cried Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon!” returned Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Why? is it--?”\r\n\r\n“It is all that remains of our airy boat, of our balloon, which has been\r\ncaught up aloft there, at the top of that tree!”\r\n\r\nPencroft was not mistaken, and he gave vent to his feelings in a\r\ntremendous hurrah, adding,--\r\n\r\n“There is good cloth! There is what will furnish us with linen for\r\nyears. There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts! Ha, ha, Mr.\r\nSpilett, what do you say to an island where shirts grow on the trees?”\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a lucky circumstance for the settlers in Lincoln Island\r\nthat the balloon, after having made its last bound into the air, had\r\nfallen on the island and thus given them the opportunity of finding it\r\nagain, whether they kept the case under its present form, or whether\r\nthey wished to attempt another escape by it, or whether they usefully\r\nemployed the several hundred yards of cotton, which was of fine quality.\r\nPencroft’s joy was therefore shared by all.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from\r\nthe tree, to place it in security, and this was no slight task. Neb,\r\nHerbert, and the sailor, climbing to the summit of the tree, used all\r\ntheir skill to disengage the now reduced balloon.\r\n\r\nThe operation lasted two hours, and then not only the case, with its\r\nvalve, its springs, its brasswork, lay on the ground, but the net, that\r\nis to say a considerable quantity of ropes and cordage, and the\r\ncircle and the anchor. The case, except for the fracture, was in good\r\ncondition, only the lower portion being torn.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortune which had fallen from the sky.\r\n\r\n“All the same, captain,” said the sailor, “if we ever decide to leave\r\nthe island, it won’t be in a balloon, will it? These airboats won’t go\r\nwhere we want them to go, and we have had some experience in that way!\r\nLook here, we will build a craft of some twenty tons, and then we can\r\nmake a main-sail, a foresail, and a jib out of that cloth. As to the\r\nrest of it, that will help to dress us.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding; “we shall see.”\r\n\r\n“In the meantime, we must put it in a safe place,” said Neb.\r\n\r\nThey certainly could not think of carrying this load of cloth,\r\nropes, and cordage, to Granite House, for the weight of it was very\r\nconsiderable, and while waiting for a suitable vehicle in which to\r\nconvey it, it was of importance that this treasure should not be left\r\nlonger exposed to the mercies of the first storm. The settlers, uniting\r\ntheir efforts, managed to drag it as far as the shore, where they\r\ndiscovered a large rocky cavity, which owing to its position could not\r\nbe visited either by the wind or rain.\r\n\r\n“We needed a locker, and now we have one,” said Pencroft; “but as we\r\ncannot lock it up, it will be prudent to hide the opening. I don’t mean\r\nfrom two-legged thieves, but from those with four paws!”\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock, all was stowed away, and after having given the creek\r\nthe very suitable name of “Port Balloon,” the settlers pursued their\r\nway along Claw Cape. Pencroft and the engineer talked of the different\r\nprojects which it was agreed to put into execution with the briefest\r\npossible delay. It was necessary first of all to throw a bridge over the\r\nMercy, so as to establish an easy communication with the south of the\r\nisland; then the cart must be taken to bring back the balloon, for the\r\ncanoe alone could not carry it, then they would build a decked boat, and\r\nPencroft would rig it as a cutter, and they would be able to undertake\r\nvoyages of circumnavigation round the island, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile night came on, and it was already dark when the\r\nsettlers reached Flotsam Point, where they had found the precious chest.\r\n\r\nThe distance between Flotsam Point and Granite House was another four\r\nmiles, and it was midnight when, after having followed the shore to the\r\nmouth of the Mercy, the settlers arrived at the first angle formed by\r\nthe Mercy.\r\n\r\nThere the river was eighty feet in breadth, which was awkward to cross,\r\nbut as Pencroft had taken upon himself to conquer this difficulty, he\r\nwas compelled to do it. The settlers certainly had reason to be pretty\r\ntired. The journey had been long, and the task of getting down the\r\nballoon had not rested either their arms or legs. They were anxious\r\nto reach Granite House to eat and sleep, and if the bridge had been\r\nconstructed, in a quarter of an hour they would have been at home.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark. Pencroft prepared to keep his promise by\r\nconstructing a sort of raft, on which to make the passage of the Mercy.\r\nHe and Neb, armed with axes, chose two trees near the water, and began\r\nto attack them at the base.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Spilett, seated on the bank, waited till their\r\ncompanions were ready for their help, while Herbert roamed about, though\r\nwithout going to any distance. All at once, the lad, who had strolled by\r\nthe river, came running back, and, pointing up the Mercy, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“What is floating there?”\r\n\r\nPencroft stopped working, and seeing an indistinct object moving through\r\nthe gloom,--\r\n\r\n“A canoe!” cried he.\r\n\r\nAll approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat floating down\r\nthe current.\r\n\r\n“Boat ahoy!” shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps it would\r\nbe best to keep silence.\r\n\r\nNo reply. The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more than twelve\r\nfeet off, when the sailor exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“But it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and floated down\r\nthe current. I must say she has arrived very opportunely.”\r\n\r\n“Our boat?” murmured the engineer.\r\n\r\nPencroft was right. It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope had\r\nundoubtedly broken, and which had come alone from the sources of the\r\nMercy. It was very important to seize it before the rapid current should\r\nhave swept it away out of the mouth of the river, but Neb and Pencroft\r\ncleverly managed this by means of a long pole.\r\n\r\nThe canoe touched the shore. The engineer leaped in first, and found,\r\non examining the rope, that it had been really worn through by rubbing\r\nagainst the rocks.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the reporter to him, in a low voice, “this is a strange\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“Strange indeed!” returned Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nStrange or not, it was very fortunate. Herbert, the reporter, Neb, and\r\nPencroft, embarked in turn. There was no doubt about the rope having\r\nbeen worn through, but the astonishing part of the affair was, that the\r\nboat should arrive just at the moment when the settlers were there to\r\nseize it on its way, for a quarter of an hour earlier or later it would\r\nhave been lost in the sea.\r\n\r\nIf they had been living in the time of genii, this incident would\r\nhave given them the right to think that the island was haunted by some\r\nsupernatural being, who used his power in the service of the castaways!\r\n\r\nA few strokes of the oar brought the settlers to the mouth of the\r\nMercy. The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the Chimneys, and all\r\nproceeded towards the ladder of Granite House.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment, Top barked angrily, and Neb, who was looking for the\r\nfirst steps, uttered a cry.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer a ladder!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding stood still, without saying a word. His companions\r\nsearched in the darkness on the wall, in case the wind should have\r\nmoved the ladder, and on the ground, thinking that it might have fallen\r\ndown.... But the ladder had quite disappeared. As to ascertaining if\r\na squall had blown it on the landing-place, half way up, that was\r\nimpossible in the dark.\r\n\r\n“If it is a joke,” cried Pencroft, “it is a very stupid one! To come\r\nhome and find no staircase to go up to your room by--that’s nothing for\r\nweary men to laugh at.”\r\n\r\nNeb could do nothing but cry out “Oh! oh! oh!”\r\n\r\n“I begin to think that very curious things happen in Lincoln Island!”\r\n said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Curious?” replied Gideon Spilett, “not at all, Pencroft, nothing can be\r\nmore natural. Some one has come during our absence, taken possession of\r\nour dwelling and drawn up the ladder.”\r\n\r\n“Some one,” cried the sailor. “But who?”\r\n\r\n“Who but the hunter who fired the bullet?” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Well, if there is any one up there,” replied Pencroft, who began to\r\nlose patience, “I will give them a hail, and they must answer.”\r\n\r\nAnd in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged “Halloo!” which\r\nwas echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks.\r\n\r\nThe settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling\r\nlaugh, of which they could not guess the origin. But no voice replied to\r\nPencroft, who in vain repeated his vigorous shouts.\r\n\r\nThere was something indeed in this to astonish the most apathetic\r\nof men, and the settlers were not men of that description. In their\r\nsituation every incident had its importance, and, certainly, during the\r\nseven months which they had spent on the island, they had not before met\r\nwith anything of so surprising a character.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity of the\r\nevent, they remained below Granite House, not knowing what to think,\r\nnot knowing what to do, questioning each other without any hope of\r\na satisfactory reply, every one starting some supposition each more\r\nunlikely than the last. Neb bewailed himself, much disappointed at not\r\nbeing able to get into his kitchen, for the provisions which they\r\nhad had on their expedition were exhausted, and they had no means of\r\nrenewing them.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” at last said Cyrus Harding, “there is only one thing to be\r\ndone at present; wait for day, and then act according to circumstances.\r\nBut let us go to the Chimneys. There we shall be under shelter, and if\r\nwe cannot eat, we can at least sleep.”\r\n\r\n“But who is it that has played us this cool trick?” again asked\r\nPencroft, unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot.\r\n\r\nWhoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer\r\nproposed, to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day. In the meanwhile\r\nTop was ordered to mount guard below the windows of Granite House, and\r\nwhen Top received an order he obeyed it without any questioning. The\r\nbrave dog therefore remained at the foot of the cliff while his master\r\nwith his companions sought a refuge among the rocks.\r\n\r\nTo say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept well on\r\nthe sandy floor of the Chimneys would not be true. It was not only that\r\nthey were extremely anxious to find out the cause of what had happened,\r\nwhether it was the result of an accident which would be discovered at\r\nthe return of day, or whether on the contrary it was the work of a human\r\nbeing; but they also had very uncomfortable beds. That could not be\r\nhelped, however, for in some way or other at that moment their dwelling\r\nwas occupied, and they could not possibly enter it.\r\n\r\nNow Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their warehouse.\r\nThere were all the stores belonging to the colony, weapons, instruments,\r\ntools, ammunition, provisions, etc. To think that all that might be\r\npillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over\r\nagain, fresh weapons and tools to make, was a serious matter. Their\r\nuneasiness led one or other of them also to go out every few minutes to\r\nsee if Top was keeping good watch. Cyrus Harding alone waited with his\r\nhabitual patience, although his strong mind was exasperated at being\r\nconfronted with such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at\r\nhimself for allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name, to\r\ngain an influence over him. Gideon Spilett shared his feelings in this\r\nrespect, and the two conversed together in whispers of the inexplicable\r\ncircumstance which baffled even their intelligence and experience.\r\n\r\n“It is a joke,” said Pencroft; “it is a trick some one has played us.\r\nWell, I don’t like such jokes, and the joker had better look out for\r\nhimself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell him.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the colonists,\r\nsuitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite House. The rising\r\nsun now shone on the cliff and they could see the windows, the shutters\r\nof which were closed, through the curtains of foliage.\r\n\r\nAll here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw\r\nthat the door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nSome one had entered Granite House--there could be no more doubt about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThe upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the landing,\r\nwas in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to\r\nthe threshold. It was evident that the intruders had wished to guard\r\nthemselves against a surprise.\r\n\r\nPencroft hailed again.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n“The beggars,” exclaimed the sailor. “There they are sleeping quietly\r\nas if they were in their own house. Hallo there, you pirates, brigands,\r\nrobbers, sons of John Bull!”\r\n\r\nWhen Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of “son of\r\nJohn Bull,” he considered he had reached the last limits of insult.\r\n\r\nThe sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of Granite House\r\nbecame illuminated by its rays; but in the interior as well as on the\r\nexterior all was quiet and calm.\r\n\r\nThe settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and yet the\r\nposition of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was; it was also\r\ncertain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not been able\r\nto escape. But how were they to be got at?\r\n\r\nHerbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and shooting the\r\narrow so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder\r\nwhich hung from the threshold. By means of the cord they would then\r\nbe able to draw down the ladder to the ground, and so re-establish the\r\ncommunication between the beach and Granite House. There was evidently\r\nnothing else to be done, and, with a little skill, this method might\r\nsucceed. Very fortunately bows and arrows had been left at the Chimneys,\r\nwhere they also found a quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft\r\nfastened this to a well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his\r\nbow, took a careful aim for the lower part of the ladder.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so as to see\r\nif anything appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted his gun to his\r\nshoulder and covered the door.\r\n\r\nThe bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and passed\r\nbetween the two last rounds.\r\n\r\nThe operation had succeeded.\r\n\r\nHerbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that moment when\r\nhe gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm, thrust suddenly out\r\nbetween the wall and the door, grasped it and dragged it inside Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n“The rascals!” shouted the sailor. “If a ball can do anything for you,\r\nyou shall not have long to wait for it.\r\n\r\n“But who was it?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Who was it? Didn’t you see?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“It was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a gorilla, a\r\nsagoin. Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who climbed up the\r\nladder during our absence.”\r\n\r\nAnd, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor’s\r\nwords, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows,\r\nfrom which they had pushed back the shutters, and saluted the real\r\nproprietors of the place with a thousand hideous grimaces.\r\n\r\n“I knew that it was only a joke,” cried Pencroft; “but one of the jokers\r\nshall pay the penalty for the rest.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at one of the\r\nmonkeys and fired. All disappeared, except one who fell mortally wounded\r\non the beach. This monkey, which was of a large size, evidently belonged\r\nto the first order of the quadrumana. Whether this was a chimpanzee, an\r\norangoutang, or a gorilla, he took rank among the anthropoid apes, who\r\nare so called from their resemblance to the human race. However, Herbert\r\ndeclared it to be an orangoutang.\r\n\r\n“What a magnificent beast!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“Magnificent, if you like,” replied Pencroft; “but still I do not see\r\nhow we are to get into our house.”\r\n\r\n“Herbert is a good marksman,” said the reporter, “and his bow is here.\r\nHe can try again.”\r\n\r\n“Why, these apes are so cunning,” returned Pencroft; “they won’t show\r\nthemselves again at the windows and so we can’t kill them; and when I\r\nthink of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse--”\r\n\r\n“Have patience,” replied Harding; “these creatures cannot keep us long\r\nat bay.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here,” replied the\r\nsailor. “And now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows\r\nare up there?”\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making\r\nanother attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder\r\nhad been drawn again into the door, and when another pull was given, the\r\nline broke and the ladder remained firm. The case was really perplexing.\r\nPencroft stormed. There was a comic side to the situation, but he did\r\nnot think it funny at all. It was certain that the settlers would end by\r\nreinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders,\r\nbut when and how? this is what they were not able to say.\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show\r\nthemselves, but they were still there, and three or four times a nose or\r\na paw was poked out at the door or windows, and was immediately saluted\r\nby a gun-shot.\r\n\r\n“Let us hide ourselves,” at last said the engineer. “Perhaps the apes\r\nwill think we have gone quite away and will show themselves again. Let\r\nSpilett and Herbert conceal themselves behind those rocks and fire on\r\nall that may appear.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and the lad,\r\nthe best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a good position,\r\nbut out of the monkeys’ sight, Neb, Pencroft, and Cyrus climbed the\r\nplateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game, for it was\r\nnow time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons, which they\r\nroasted as well as they could. Not an ape had appeared. Gideon Spilett\r\nand Herbert went to take their share of the breakfast, leaving Top to\r\nwatch under the windows. They then, having eaten, returned to their\r\npost.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, their situation was in no degree improved. The\r\nquadrumana gave no sign of existence, and it might have been supposed\r\nthat they had disappeared; but what seemed more probable was that,\r\nterrified by the death of one of their companions, and frightened by the\r\nnoise of the firearms, they had retreated to the back part of the house\r\nor probably even into the store-room. And when they thought of\r\nthe valuables which this storeroom contained, the patience so much\r\nrecommended by the engineer, fast changed into great irritation, and\r\nthere certainly was room for it.\r\n\r\n“Decidedly it is too bad,” said the reporter; “and the worst of it is,\r\nthere is no way of putting an end to it.”\r\n\r\n“But we must drive these vagabonds out somehow,” cried the sailor.\r\n“We could soon get the better of them, even if there are twenty of the\r\nrascals; but for that, we must meet them hand to hand. Come now, is\r\nthere no way of getting at them?”\r\n\r\n“Let us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the lake,”\r\n replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” shouted the sailor, “and I never thought of that.”\r\n\r\nThis was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into Granite\r\nHouse so as to fight with and drive out the intruders. The opening was,\r\nit is true, closed up with a wall of cemented stones, which it would be\r\nnecessary to sacrifice, but that could easily be rebuilt. Fortunately,\r\nCyrus Harding had not as yet effected his project of hiding this opening\r\nby raising the waters of the lake, for the operation would then have\r\ntaken some time.\r\n\r\nIt was already past twelve o’clock, when the colonists, well armed and\r\nprovided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed beneath the\r\nwindows of Granite House, after telling Top to remain at his post, and\r\nbegan to ascend the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect\r\nHeights.\r\n\r\nBut they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they heard the\r\ndog barking furiously.\r\n\r\nAnd all rushed down the bank again.\r\n\r\nArrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had changed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown cause,\r\nwere trying to escape. Two or three ran and clambered from one window\r\nto another with the agility of acrobats. They were not even trying to\r\nreplace the ladder, by which it would have been easy to descend; perhaps\r\nin their terror they had forgotten this way of escape. The colonists,\r\nnow being able to take aim without difficulty, fired. Some, wounded or\r\nkilled, fell back into the rooms, uttering piercing cries. The rest,\r\nthrowing themselves out, were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a\r\nfew minutes, so far as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in\r\nGranite House.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold, then\r\nunroll and fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” cried the sailor, “this is queer!”\r\n\r\n“Very strange!” murmured the engineer, leaping first up the ladder.\r\n\r\n“Take care, captain!” cried Pencroft, “perhaps there are still some of\r\nthese rascals.\r\n\r\n“We shall soon see,” replied the engineer, without stopping however.\r\n\r\nAll his companions followed him, and in a minute they had arrived at the\r\nthreshold. They searched everywhere. There was no one in the rooms nor\r\nin the storehouse, which had been respected by the band of quadrumana.\r\n\r\n“Well now, and the ladder,” cried the sailor; “who can the gentleman\r\nhave been who sent us that down?”\r\n\r\nBut at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had hidden\r\nhimself in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by Neb.\r\n\r\n“Ah, the robber!” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAnd hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the animal, when\r\nCyrus Harding seized his arm, saying,--\r\n\r\n“Spare him, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon this rascal?”\r\n\r\n“Yes! it was he who threw us the ladder!”\r\n\r\nAnd the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was\r\ndifficult to know whether he spoke seriously or not.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended himself\r\ngallantly, but was soon overpowered and bound.\r\n\r\n“There!” said Pencroft. “And what shall we make of him, now we’ve got\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“A servant!” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\nThe lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this intelligent\r\nrace could be turned to account.\r\n\r\nThe settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively. He\r\nbelonged to the family of anthropoid apes, of which the facial angle is\r\nnot much inferior to that of the Australians and Hottentots. It was an\r\norangoutang, and as such, had neither the ferocity of the gorilla, nor\r\nthe stupidity of the baboon. It is to this family of the anthropoid apes\r\nthat so many characteristics belong which prove them to be possessed\r\nof an almost human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait at\r\ntable, sweep rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork,\r\nand spoon properly, and even drink wine... doing everything as well as\r\nthe best servant that ever walked upon two legs. Buffon possessed one\r\nof these apes, who served him for a long time as a faithful and zealous\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nThe one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a great\r\nfellow, six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a broad\r\nchest, head of a moderate size, the facial angle reaching sixty-five\r\ndegrees, round skull, projecting nose, skin covered with soft glossy\r\nhair, in short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids. His eyes, rather\r\nsmaller than human eyes, sparkled with intelligence; his white teeth\r\nglittered under his mustache, and he wore a little curly brown beard.\r\n\r\n“A handsome fellow!” said Pencroft; “if we only knew his language, we\r\ncould talk to him.”\r\n\r\n“But, master,” said Neb, “are you serious? Are we going to take him as a\r\nservant?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Neb,” replied the engineer, smiling. “But you must not be\r\njealous.”\r\n\r\n“And I hope he will make an excellent servant,” added Herbert. “He\r\nappears young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be obliged\r\nto use force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is sometimes done. He\r\nwill soon grow fond of his masters if they are kind to him.”\r\n\r\n“And they will be,” replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his rancor\r\nagainst “the jokers.”\r\n\r\nThen, approaching the orang,--\r\n\r\n“Well, old boy!” he asked, “how are you?”\r\n\r\nThe orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger.\r\n\r\n“You wish to join the colony?” again asked the sailor. “You are going to\r\nenter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?”\r\n\r\nAnother respondent grunt was uttered by the ape.\r\n\r\n“And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?”\r\n\r\nThird affirmative grunt.\r\n\r\n“This conversation is slightly monotonous,” observed Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“So much the better,” replied Pencroft; “the best servants are those who\r\ntalk the least. And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy? We will give\r\nyou no wages at first, but we will double them afterwards if we are\r\npleased with you.”\r\n\r\nThus the colony was increased by a new member. As to his name the sailor\r\nbegged that in memory of another ape which he had known, he might be\r\ncalled Jupiter, and Jup for short.\r\n\r\nAnd so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nThe settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling, without\r\nhaving been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and were therefore\r\nspared the trouble of mason’s work. It was certainly lucky, that at the\r\nmoment they were about to set out to do so, the apes had been seized\r\nwith that terror, no less sudden than inexplicable, which had driven\r\nthem out of Granite House. Had the animals discovered that they\r\nwere about to be attacked from another direction? This was the only\r\nexplanation of their sudden retreat.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the wood, where\r\nthey were buried; then the settlers busied themselves in repairing the\r\ndisorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not damage, for although\r\nthey had turned everything in the rooms topsy-turvy, yet they had broken\r\nnothing. Neb relighted his stove, and the stores in the larder furnished\r\na substantial repast, to which all did ample justice.\r\n\r\nJup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine almonds\r\nand rhizome roots, with which he was abundantly supplied. Pencroft had\r\nunfastened his arms, but judged it best to have his legs tied until they\r\nwere more sure of his submission.\r\n\r\nThen, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated round\r\ntheir table, discussed those plans, the execution of which was most\r\npressing. The most important and most urgent was the establishment of a\r\nbridge over the Mercy, so as to form a communication with the southern\r\npart of the island and Granite House; then the making of an enclosure\r\nfor the musmons or other woolly animals which they wished to capture.\r\n\r\nThese two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to their\r\nclothing, which was now serious. The bridge would render easy the\r\ntransport of the balloon case, which would furnish them with linen, and\r\nthe inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which would supply\r\nthem with winter clothes.\r\n\r\nAs to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding’s intention to establish it at\r\nthe sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants would find fresh and\r\nabundant pasture. The road between Prospect Heights and the sources of\r\nthe stream was already partly beaten, and with a better cart than the\r\nfirst, the material could be easily conveyed to the spot, especially if\r\nthey could manage to capture some animals to draw it.\r\n\r\nBut though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far\r\nfrom Granite House, it would not be the same with the poultry-yard, to\r\nwhich Neb called the attention of the colonists. It was indeed necessary\r\nthat the birds should be close within reach of the cook, and no place\r\nappeared more favorable for the establishment of the said poultry-yard\r\nthan that portion of the banks of the lake which was close to the old\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nWater-birds would prosper there as well as others, and the couple\r\nof tinamous taken in their last excursion would be the first to be\r\ndomesticated.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 3rd of November, the new works were begun by the\r\nconstruction of the bridge, and all hands were required for this\r\nimportant task. Saws, hatchets, and hammers were shouldered by the\r\nsettlers, who, now transformed into carpenters, descended to the shore.\r\n\r\nThere Pencroft observed,--\r\n\r\n“Suppose, that during our absence, Master Jup takes it into his head to\r\ndraw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“Let us tie its lower end down firmly,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nThis was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand. Then\r\nthe settlers, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, soon arrived at the\r\nangle formed by the river.\r\n\r\nThere they halted, in order to ascertain if the bridge could be thrown\r\nacross. The place appeared suitable.\r\n\r\nIn fact, from this spot, to Port Balloon, discovered the day before on\r\nthe southern coast, there was only a distance of three miles and a\r\nhalf, and from the bridge to the Port, it would be easy to make a good\r\ncart-road which would render the communication between Granite House and\r\nthe south of the island extremely easy.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely\r\nisolating Prospect Heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of\r\nquadrupeds and quadrumana. In this way, Granite House, the Chimneys, the\r\npoultry-yard, and all the upper part of the plateau which was to be used\r\nfor cultivation, would be protected against the depredations of animals.\r\nNothing could be easier than to execute this project, and this is how\r\nthe engineer intended to set to work.\r\n\r\nThe plateau was already defended on three sides by water-courses, either\r\nartificial or natural. On the northwest, by the shores of Lake Grant,\r\nfrom the entrance of the passage to the breach made in the banks of the\r\nlake for the escape of the water.\r\n\r\nOn the north, from this breach to the sea, by the new water-course which\r\nhad hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore, above\r\nand below the fall, and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek\r\na little deeper to make it impracticable for animals, on all the eastern\r\nborder by the sea itself, from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the\r\nmouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nLastly, on the south, from the mouth to the turn of the Mercy where the\r\nbridge was to be established.\r\n\r\nThe western border of the plateau now remained between the turn of the\r\nriver and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of about a mile,\r\nwhich was open to all comers. But nothing could be easier than to dig a\r\nbroad deep ditch, which could be filled from the lake, and the overflow\r\nof which would throw itself by a rapid fall into the bed of the Mercy.\r\nThe level of the lake would, no doubt, be somewhat lowered by this fresh\r\ndischarge of its waters, but Cyrus Harding had ascertained that the\r\nvolume of water in the Red Creek was considerable enough to allow of the\r\nexecution of this project.\r\n\r\n“So then,” added the engineer, “Prospect Heights will become a regular\r\nisland, being surrounded with water on all sides, and only communicating\r\nwith the rest of our domain by the bridge which we are about to throw\r\nacross the Mercy, the two little bridges already established above and\r\nbelow the fall; and, lastly, two other little bridges which must be\r\nconstructed, one over the canal which I propose to dig, the other across\r\nto the left bank of the Mercy. Now, if these bridges can be raised at\r\nwill, Prospect Heights will be guarded from any surprise.”\r\n\r\nThe bridge was the most urgent work. Trees were selected, cut down,\r\nstripped of their branches, and cut into beams, joists, and planks. The\r\nend of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the Mercy was to be\r\nfirm, but the other end on the left bank was to be movable, so that it\r\nmight be raised by means of a counterpoise, as some canal bridges are\r\nmanaged.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a considerable work, and though it was skillfully\r\nconducted, it took some time, for the Mercy at this place was eighty\r\nfeet wide. It was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of\r\nthe river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a\r\npile-driver to act on the tops of these piles, which would thus form two\r\narches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads.\r\n\r\nHappily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood, nor\r\nof iron-work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who had a\r\nmarvelous knowledge of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his companions,\r\nwho in seven months had necessarily acquired great skill in the use of\r\ntheir tools; and it must be said that not the least skilful was Gideon\r\nSpilett, who in dexterity almost equaled the sailor himself. “Who would\r\never have expected so much from a newspaper man!” thought Pencroft.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Mercy bridge lasted three weeks of regular\r\nhard work. They even breakfasted on the scene of their labors, and the\r\nweather being magnificent, they only returned to Granite House to sleep.\r\n\r\nDuring this period it may be stated that Master Jup grew more accustomed\r\nto his new masters, whose movements he always watched with very\r\ninquisitive eyes. However, as a precautionary measure, Pencroft did not\r\nas yet allow him complete liberty, rightly wishing to wait until the\r\nlimits of the plateau should be settled by the projected works. Top\r\nand Jup were good friends and played willingly together, but Jup did\r\neverything solemnly.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November the bridge was finished. The movable part,\r\nbalanced by the counterpoise, swung easily, and only a slight effort was\r\nneeded to raise it; between its hinge and the last cross-bar on which\r\nit rested when closed, there existed a space of twenty feet, which was\r\nsufficiently wide to prevent any animals from crossing.\r\n\r\nThe settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon-case, which they\r\nwere anxious to place in perfect security; but to bring it, it would be\r\nnecessary to take a cart to Port Balloon, and consequently, necessary to\r\nbeat a road through the dense forests of the Far West. This would take\r\nsome time. Also, Neb and Pencroft having gone to examine into the state\r\nof things at Port Balloon, and reported that the stock of cloth would\r\nsuffer no damage in the grotto where it was stored, it was decided that\r\nthe work at Prospect Heights should not be discontinued.\r\n\r\n“That,” observed Pencroft, “will enable us to establish our poultry-yard\r\nunder better conditions, since we need have no fear of visits from foxes\r\nnor the attacks of other beasts.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” added Neb, “we can clear the plateau, and transplant wild plants\r\nto it.”\r\n\r\n“And prepare our second corn-field!” cried the sailor with a triumphant\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the first corn-field sown with a single grain had prospered\r\nadmirably, thanks to Pencroft’s care. It had produced the ten ears\r\nforetold by the engineer, and each ear containing eighty grains, the\r\ncolony found itself in possession of eight hundred grains, in six\r\nmonths, which promised a double harvest each year.\r\n\r\nThese eight hundred grains, except fifty, which were prudently reserved,\r\nwere to be sown in a new field, but with no less care than was bestowed\r\non the single grain.\r\n\r\nThe field was prepared, then surrounded with a strong palisade, high and\r\npointed, which quadrupeds would have found difficulty in leaping. As to\r\nbirds, some scarecrows, due to Pencroft’s ingenious brain, were enough\r\nto frighten them. The seven hundred and fifty grains deposited in very\r\nregular furrows were then left for nature to do the rest.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of November, Cyrus Harding began to plan the canal which was\r\nto close the plateau on the west, from the south angle of Lake Grant to\r\nthe angle of the Mercy. There was there two or three feet of vegetable\r\nearth, and below that granite. It was therefore necessary to manufacture\r\nsome more nitro-glycerine, and the nitro-glycerine did its accustomed\r\nwork. In less than a fortnight a ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep,\r\nwas dug out in the hard ground of the plateau. A new trench was made by\r\nthe same means in the rocky border of the lake, forming a small stream,\r\nto which they gave the name of Creek Glycerine, and which was thus an\r\naffluent of the Mercy. As the engineer had predicted, the level of the\r\nlake was lowered, though very slightly. To complete the enclosure the\r\nbed of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand\r\nsupported by means of stakes.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the first fortnight of December these works were finished,\r\nand Prospect Heights--that is to say, a sort of irregular pentagon,\r\nhaving a perimeter of nearly four miles, surrounded by a liquid\r\nbelt--was completely protected from depredators of every description.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of December, the heat was very great. In spite of it,\r\nhowever, the settlers continued their work, and as they were anxious to\r\npossess a poultry-yard they forthwith commenced it.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to say that since the enclosing of the plateau had been\r\ncompleted, Master Jup had been set at liberty. He did not leave his\r\nmasters, and evinced no wish to escape. He was a gentle animal, though\r\nvery powerful and wonderfully active. He was already taught to make\r\nhimself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones\r\nwhich were extracted from the bed of Creek Glycerine.\r\n\r\nThe poultry-yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards, on the\r\nsoutheastern bank of the lake. It was surrounded by a palisade, and\r\nin it were constructed various shelters for the birds which were to\r\npopulate it. These were simply built of branches and divided into\r\ncompartments, made ready for the expected guests.\r\n\r\nThe first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a number\r\nof young ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks, accustomed to\r\nthe borders of the lake. Some belonged to the Chinese species, of which\r\nthe wings open like a fan, and which by the brilliancy of their plumage\r\nrival the golden pheasants. A few days afterwards, Herbert snared a\r\ncouple of gallinaceae, with spreading tails composed of long feathers,\r\nmagnificent alectors, which soon became tame. As to pelicans,\r\nkingfishers, water-hens, they came of themselves to the shores of the\r\npoultry-yard, and this little community, after some disputes, cooing,\r\nscreaming, clucking, ended by settling down peacefully, and increased in\r\nencouraging proportion for the future use of the colony.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established a\r\npigeon-house in a corner of the poultry-yard. There he lodged a dozen\r\nof those pigeons which frequented the rocks of the plateau. These birds\r\nsoon became accustomed to returning every evening to their new dwelling,\r\nand showed more disposition to domesticate themselves than their\r\ncongeners, the wood-pigeons.\r\n\r\nLastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use, by\r\ncutting it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to keeping it in\r\nits present form, and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas,\r\nabove a sea of the limits of which they had no idea, it was not to be\r\nthought of.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the colonists\r\nemployed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more\r\nmanageable. But though they had a vehicle, the moving power was yet to\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nBut did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the\r\nplace of the horse, ass, or ox? That was the question.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Pencroft, “a beast of burden would be very useful to\r\nus until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an engine, for some\r\nday we shall have a railroad from Granite House to Port Balloon, with a\r\nbranch line to Mount Franklin!”\r\n\r\nOne day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting and\r\nbarking, each apparently trying to see who could make the most noise.\r\nThe settlers, who were busy at the Chimneys, ran, fearing some vexatious\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nWhat did they see? Two fine animals of a large size that had imprudently\r\nventured on the plateau, when the bridges were open. One would have said\r\nthey were horses, or at least donkeys, male and female, of a fine shape,\r\ndove-colored, the legs and tail white, striped with black on the head\r\nand neck. They advanced quietly without showing any uneasiness, and\r\ngazed at the men, in whom they could not as yet recognize their future\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n“These are onagers!” cried Herbert, “animals something between the zebra\r\nand the quagga!”\r\n\r\n“Why not donkeys?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Because they have not long ears, and their shape is more graceful!”\r\n\r\n“Donkeys or horses,” interrupted Pencroft, “they are ‘moving powers,’ as\r\nthe captain would say, and as such must be captured!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the grass\r\nto the bridge over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the onagers were\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nNow, should they seize them with violence and master them by force? No.\r\nIt was decided that for a few days they should be allowed to roam\r\nfreely about the plateau, where there was an abundance of grass, and the\r\nengineer immediately began to prepare a stable near the poultry-yard,\r\nin which the onagers might find food, with a good litter, and shelter\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nThis done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were left\r\nentirely free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them so as to\r\nterrify them. Several times, however, the onagers appeared to wish to\r\nleave the plateau, too confined for animals accustomed to the plains\r\nand forests. They were then seen following the water-barrier which\r\neverywhere presented itself before them, uttering short neighs, then\r\ngalloping through the grass, and becoming calmer, they would remain\r\nentire hours gazing at the woods, from which they were cut off for ever!\r\n\r\nIn the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured, and\r\nsome days after the capture of the onagers, not only the cart was ready,\r\nbut a straight road, or rather a cutting, had been made through the\r\nforests of the Far West, from the angle of the Mercy to Port Balloon.\r\nThe cart might then be driven there, and towards the end of December\r\nthey tried the onagers for the first time.\r\n\r\nPencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of his hand,\r\nand they allowed him to approach without making any difficulty, but once\r\nharnessed they reared and could with difficulty be held in. However, it\r\nwas not long before they submitted to this new service, for the onager,\r\nbeing less refractory than the zebra, is frequently put in harness\r\nin the mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and it has even been\r\nacclimatized in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness.\r\n\r\nOn this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the animals’\r\nheads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port Balloon.\r\n\r\nOf course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the vehicle\r\narrived without any accident, and was soon loaded with the case and\r\nrigging of the balloon.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock that evening the cart, after passing over the Mercy\r\nbridge, descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on the beach.\r\nThe onagers being unharnessed, were thence led to their stable, and\r\nPencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his feelings in a deep sigh\r\nof satisfaction that awoke all the echoes of Granite House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nThe first week of January was devoted to the manufacture of the linen\r\ngarments required by the colony. The needles found in the box were used\r\nby sturdy if not delicate fingers, and we may be sure that what was sewn\r\nwas sewn firmly.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of thread, thanks to Cyrus Harding’s idea of\r\nre-employing that which had been already used in the covering of the\r\nballoon. This with admirable patience was all unpicked by Gideon Spilett\r\nand Herbert, for Pencroft had been obliged to give this work up, as it\r\nirritated him beyond measure; but he had no equal in the sewing part\r\nof the business. Indeed, everybody knows that sailors have a remarkable\r\naptitude for tailoring.\r\n\r\nThe cloth of which the balloon-case was made was then cleaned by means\r\nof soda and potash, obtained by the incineration of plants, in such a\r\nway that the cotton, having got rid of the varnish, resumed its natural\r\nsoftness and elasticity; then, exposed to the action of the atmosphere,\r\nit soon became perfectly white. Some dozen shirts and sock--the latter\r\nnot knitted, of course, but made of cotton--were thus manufactured. What\r\na comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves again in clean\r\nlinen, which was doubtless rather rough, but they were not troubled\r\nabout that! and then to go to sleep between sheets, which made the\r\ncouches at Granite House into quite comfortable beds!\r\n\r\nIt was about this time also that they made boots of seal-leather, which\r\nwere greatly needed to replace the shoes and boots brought from America.\r\nWe may be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched\r\nthe feet of the wearers.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great, but\r\nthe hunting in the forests did not stand still. Agouties, peccaries,\r\ncapybaras, kangaroos, game of all sorts, actually swarmed there, and\r\nSpilett and Herbert were too good marksmen ever to throw away their shot\r\nuselessly.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition, and he\r\ntook measures to replace the powder and shot which had been found in\r\nthe box, and which he wished to reserve for the future. How did he know\r\nwhere chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the\r\nevent of their leaving their domain? They should, then, prepare for the\r\nunknown future by husbanding their ammunition and by substituting for it\r\nsome easily renewable substance.\r\n\r\nTo replace lead, of which Harding had found no traces in the island, he\r\nemployed granulated iron, which was easy to manufacture. These bullets,\r\nnot having the weight of leaden bullets, were made larger, and each\r\ncharge contained less, but the skill of the sportsmen made up this\r\ndeficiency. As to powder, Cyrus Harding would have been able to make\r\nthat also, for he had at his disposal saltpeter, sulphur, and coal; but\r\nthis preparation requires extreme care, and without special tools it is\r\ndifficult to produce it of a good quality. Harding preferred, therefore,\r\nto manufacture pyroxyle, that is to say gun-cotton, a substance in which\r\ncotton is not indispensable, as the elementary tissue of vegetables may\r\nbe used, and this is found in an almost pure state, not only in cotton,\r\nbut in the textile fiber of hemp and flax, in paper, the pith of the\r\nelder, etc. Now, the elder abounded in the island towards the mouth of\r\nRed Creek, and the colonists had already made coffee of the berries of\r\nthese shrubs, which belong to the family of the caprifoliaceae.\r\n\r\nThe only thing to be collected, therefore, was elder-pith, for as to the\r\nother substance necessary for the manufacture of pyroxyle, it was only\r\nfuming azotic acid. Now, Harding having sulphuric acid at his disposal,\r\nhad already been easily able to produce azotic acid by attacking the\r\nsaltpeter with which nature supplied him. He accordingly resolved to\r\nmanufacture and employ pyroxyle, although it has some inconveniences,\r\nthat is to say, a great inequality of effect, an excessive\r\ninflammability, since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy\r\ndegrees instead of two hundred and forty, and lastly, an instantaneous\r\ndeflagration which might damage the firearms. On the other hand, the\r\nadvantages of pyroxyle consist in this, that it is not injured by damp,\r\nthat it does not make the gun-barrels dirty, and that its force is four\r\ntimes that of ordinary powder.\r\n\r\nTo make pyroxyle, the cotton must be immersed in the fuming azotic acid\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, then washed in cold water and dried. Nothing\r\ncould be more simple.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding had only at his disposal the ordinary azotic acid and not\r\nthe fuming or monohydrate azotic acid, that is to say, acid which emits\r\nwhite vapors when it comes in contact with damp air; but by substituting\r\nfor the latter ordinary azotic acid, mixed, in the proportion of from\r\nthree to five volumes of concentrated sulphuric acid, the engineer\r\nobtained the same result. The sportsmen of the island therefore soon\r\nhad a perfectly prepared substance, which, employed discreetly, produced\r\nadmirable results.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the settlers cleared three acres of the plateau, and\r\nthe rest was preserved in a wild state, for the benefit of the onagers.\r\nSeveral excursions were made into the Jacamar Wood and the forests of\r\nthe Far West, and they brought back from thence a large collection of\r\nwild vegetables, spinach, cress, radishes, and turnips, which careful\r\nculture would soon improve, and which would temper the regimen on which\r\nthe settlers had till then subsisted. Supplies of wood and coal were\r\nalso carted. Each excursion was at the same time a means of improving\r\nthe roads, which gradually became smoother under the wheels of the cart.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-warren still continued to supply the larder of Granite House.\r\nAs fortunately it was situated on the other side of Creek Glycerine,\r\nits inhabitants could not reach the plateau nor ravage the newly-made\r\nplantation. The oyster-bed among the rocks was frequently renewed and\r\nfurnished excellent molluscs. Besides that, the fishing, either in\r\nthe lake or the Mercy, was very profitable, for Pencroft had made some\r\nlines, armed with iron hooks, with which they frequently caught fine\r\ntrout, and a species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with\r\nyellow, and which were also extremely savory. Master Neb, who was\r\nskilled in the culinary art, knew how to vary agreeably the bill of\r\nfare. Bread alone was wanting at the table of the settlers, and as has\r\nbeen said, they felt this privation greatly.\r\n\r\nThe settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores of\r\nCape Mandible. At this place the beach was covered with little mounds,\r\nconcealing perfectly spherical turtles’ eggs, with white hard shells,\r\nthe albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds’ eggs. They\r\nwere hatched by the sun, and their number was naturally considerable, as\r\neach turtle can lay annually two hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\n“A regular egg-field,” observed Gideon Spilett, “and we have nothing to\r\ndo but to pick them up.”\r\n\r\nBut not being contented with simply the produce, they made chase after\r\nthe producers, the result of which was that they were able to bring back\r\nto Granite House a dozen of these chelonians, which were really valuable\r\nfrom an alimentary point of view. The turtle soup, flavored with\r\naromatic herbs, often gained well-merited praises for its preparer, Neb.\r\n\r\nWe must here mention another fortunate circumstance by which new stores\r\nfor the winter were laid in. Shoals of salmon entered the Mercy, and\r\nascended the country for several miles. It was the time at which the\r\nfemales, going to find suitable places in which to spawn, precede the\r\nmales and make a great noise through the fresh water. A thousand of\r\nthese fish, which measured about two feet and a half in length, came up\r\nthe river, and a large quantity were retained by fixing dams across\r\nthe stream. More than a hundred were thus taken, which were salted and\r\nstored for the time when winter, freezing up the streams, would render\r\nfishing impracticable. By this time the intelligent Jup was raised\r\nto the duty of valet. He had been dressed in a jacket, white linen\r\nbreeches, and an apron, the pockets of which were his delight. The\r\nclever orang had been marvelously trained by Neb, and any one would have\r\nsaid that the Negro and the ape understood each other when they talked\r\ntogether. Jup had besides a real affection for Neb, and Neb returned\r\nit. When his services were not required, either for carrying wood or for\r\nclimbing to the top of some tree, Jup passed the greatest part of his\r\ntime in the kitchen, where he endeavored to imitate Neb in all that he\r\nsaw him do. The black showed the greatest patience and even extreme\r\nzeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil exhibited remarkable\r\nintelligence in profiting by the lessons he received from his master.\r\n\r\nJudge then of the pleasure Master Jup gave to the inhabitants of Granite\r\nHouse when, without their having had any idea of it, he appeared one\r\nday, napkin on his arm, ready to wait at table. Quick, attentive, he\r\nacquitted himself perfectly, changing the plates, bringing dishes,\r\npouring out water, all with a gravity which gave intense amusement to\r\nthe settlers, and which enraptured Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Jup, some soup!”\r\n\r\n“Jup, a little agouti!”\r\n\r\n“Jup, a plate!”\r\n\r\n“Jup! Good Jup! Honest Jup!”\r\n\r\nNothing was heard but that, and Jup without ever being disconcerted,\r\nreplied to every one, watched for everything, and he shook his head in a\r\nknowing way when Pencroft, referring to his joke of the first day, said\r\nto him,--\r\n\r\n“Decidedly, Jup, your wages must be doubled.”\r\n\r\nIt is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly domesticated at\r\nGranite House, and that he often accompanied his masters to the forest\r\nwithout showing any wish to leave them. It was most amusing to see him\r\nwalking with a stick which Pencroft had given him, and which he carried\r\non his shoulder like a gun. If they wished to gather some fruit from\r\nthe summit of a tree, how quickly he climbed for it. If the wheel of the\r\ncart stuck in the mud, with what energy did Jup with a single heave of\r\nhis shoulder put it right again.\r\n\r\n“What a jolly fellow he is!” cried Pencroft often. “If he was as\r\nmischievous as he is good, there would be no doing anything with him!”\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of January the colonists began their labors in\r\nthe center of the island. It had been decided that a corral should be\r\nestablished near the sources of the Red Creek, at the foot of Mount\r\nFranklin, destined to contain the ruminants, whose presence would have\r\nbeen troublesome at Granite House, and especially for the musmons, who\r\nwere to supply the wool for the settlers’ winter garments.\r\n\r\nEach morning, the colony, sometimes entire, but more often represented\r\nonly by Harding, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the sources of the\r\nCreek, a distance of not more than five miles, by the newly beaten road\r\nto which the name of Corral Road had been given.\r\n\r\nThere a site was chosen, at the back of the southern ridge of the\r\nmountain. It was a meadow land, dotted here and there with clumps of\r\ntrees, and watered by a little stream, which sprung from the slopes\r\nwhich closed it in on one side. The grass was fresh, and it was not\r\ntoo much shaded by the trees which grew about it. This meadow was to\r\nbe surrounded by a palisade, high enough to prevent even the most agile\r\nanimals from leaping over. This enclosure would be large enough to\r\ncontain a hundred musmons and wild goats, with all the young ones they\r\nmight produce.\r\n\r\nThe perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer, and\r\nthey would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the\r\nconstruction of the palisade, but as the opening up of the road had\r\nalready necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number, those were\r\nbrought and supplied a hundred stakes, which were firmly fixed in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this corral did not take less than three weeks,\r\nfor besides the palisade, Cyrus Harding built large sheds, in which the\r\nanimals could take shelter. These buildings had also to be made very\r\nstrong, for musmons are powerful animals, and their first fury was to be\r\nfeared. The stakes, sharpened at their upper end and hardened by fire,\r\nhad been fixed by means of cross-bars, and at regular distances props\r\nassured the solidity of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe corral finished, a raid had to be made on the pastures frequented\r\nby the ruminants. This was done on the 7th of February, on a beautiful\r\nsummer’s day, and every one took part in it. The onagers, already well\r\ntrained, were ridden by Spilett and Herbert, and were of great use.\r\n\r\nThe maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats, and\r\ngradually narrowing the circle around them. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft,\r\nNeb, and Jup, posted themselves in different parts of the wood, while\r\nthe two cavaliers and Top galloped in a radius of half a mile round the\r\ncorral.\r\n\r\nThe musmons were very numerous in this part of the island. These fine\r\nanimals were as large as deer; their horns were stronger than those of\r\nthe ram, and their gray-colored fleece was mixed with long hair.\r\n\r\nThis hunting day was very fatiguing. Such going and coming, and running\r\nand riding and shouting! Of a hundred musmons which had been surrounded,\r\nmore than two-thirds escaped, but at last, thirty of these animals and\r\nten wild goats were gradually driven back towards the corral, the open\r\ndoor of which appearing to offer a means of escape, they rushed in and\r\nwere prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn short, the result was satisfactory, and the settlers had no reason to\r\ncomplain. There was no doubt that the flock would prosper, and that at\r\nno distant time not only wool but hides would be abundant.\r\n\r\nThat evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite exhausted.\r\nHowever, notwithstanding their fatigue, they returned the next day\r\nto visit the corral. The prisoners had been trying to overthrow the\r\npalisade, but of course had not succeeded, and were not long in becoming\r\nmore tranquil.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of February, no event of any importance occurred. The\r\ndaily labors were pursued methodically, and, as well as improving the\r\nroads to the corral and to Port Balloon, a third was commenced, which,\r\nstarting from the enclosure, proceeded towards the western coast. The\r\nyet unknown portion of Lincoln Island was that of the wood-covered\r\nSerpentine Peninsula, which sheltered the wild beasts, from which Gideon\r\nSpilett was so anxious to clear their domain.\r\n\r\nBefore the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was given\r\nto the cultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted from\r\nthe forest to Prospect Heights. Herbert never returned from an excursion\r\nwithout bringing home some useful vegetable. One day, it was some\r\nspecimens of the chicory tribe, the seeds of which by pressure yield an\r\nexcellent oil; another, it was some common sorrel, whose antiscorbutic\r\nqualities were not to be despised; then, some of those precious tubers,\r\nwhich have at all times been cultivated in South America, potatoes, of\r\nwhich more than two hundred species are now known. The kitchen garden,\r\nnow well stocked and carefully defended from the birds, was divided\r\ninto small beds, where grew lettuces, kidney potatoes, sorrel, turnips,\r\nradishes, and other coneiferae. The soil on the plateau was particularly\r\nfertile, and it was hoped that the harvests would be abundant.\r\n\r\nThey had also a variety of different beverages, and so long as they did\r\nnot demand wine, the most hard to please would have had no reason to\r\ncomplain. To the Oswego tea, and the fermented liquor extracted from the\r\nroots of the dragonnier, Harding had added a regular beer, made from\r\nthe young shoots of the spruce-fir, which, after having been boiled\r\nand fermented, made that agreeable drink called by the Anglo-Americans\r\nspring-beer.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the summer, the poultry-yard was possessed of\r\na couple of fine bustards, which belonged to the houbara species,\r\ncharacterized by a sort of feathery mantle; a dozen shovelers, whose\r\nupper mandible was prolonged on each side by a membraneous appendage;\r\nand also some magnificent cocks, similar to the Mozambique cocks,\r\nthe comb, caruncle, and epidermis being black. So far, everything had\r\nsucceeded, thanks to the activity of these courageous and intelligent\r\nmen. Nature did much for them, doubtless; but faithful to the great\r\nprecept, they made a right use of what a bountiful Providence gave them.\r\n\r\nAfter the heat of these warm summer days, in the evening when their work\r\nwas finished and the sea-breeze began to blow, they liked to sit on the\r\nedge of Prospect Heights, in a sort of veranda, covered with creepers,\r\nwhich Neb had made with his own hands. There they talked, they\r\ninstructed each other, they made plans, and the rough good-humor of\r\nthe sailor always amused this little world, in which the most perfect\r\nharmony had never ceased to reign.\r\n\r\nThey often spoke of their country, of their dear and great America. What\r\nwas the result of the War of Secession? It could not have been greatly\r\nprolonged. Richmond had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of General\r\nGrant. The taking of the capital of the Confederates must have been the\r\nlast action of this terrible struggle. Now the North had triumphed in\r\nthe good cause, how welcome would have been a newspaper to the exiles in\r\nLincoln Island! For eleven months all communication between them and the\r\nrest of their fellow-creatures had been interrupted, and in a short time\r\nthe 24th of March would arrive, the anniversary of the day on which\r\nthe balloon had thrown them on this unknown coast. They were then mere\r\ncastaways, not even knowing how they should preserve their miserable\r\nlives from the fury of the elements! And now, thanks to the knowledge of\r\ntheir captain, and their own intelligence, they were regular colonists,\r\nfurnished with arms, tools, and instruments; they had been able to turn\r\nto their profit the animals, plants, and minerals of the island, that is\r\nto say, the three kingdoms of Nature.\r\n\r\nYes; they often talked of all these things and formed still more plans.\r\n\r\nAs to Cyrus Harding he was for the most part silent, and listened to\r\nhis companions more often than he spoke to them. Sometimes he smiled\r\nat Herbert’s ideas or Pencroft’s nonsense, but always and everywhere he\r\npondered over those inexplicable facts, that strange enigma, of which\r\nthe secret still escaped him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nThe weather changed during the first week of March. There had been a\r\nfull moon at the commencement of the month, and the heat was excessive.\r\nThe atmosphere was felt to be full of electricity, and a period of some\r\nlength of tempestuous weather was to be feared.\r\n\r\nIndeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew from the\r\neast, and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House like\r\nvolleys of grape-shot. The door and windows were immediately closed,\r\nor everything in the rooms would have been drenched. On seeing these\r\nhailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon’s egg, Pencroft’s\r\nfirst thought was that his cornfield was in serious danger.\r\n\r\nHe directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were already\r\nappearing, and by means of a great cloth, he managed to protect his\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThis bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder rolled\r\nwithout cessation in the depths of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors, profited\r\nby the bad weather to work at the interior of Granite House, the\r\narrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day. The\r\nengineer made a turning-lathe, with which he turned several articles\r\nboth for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly buttons, the want of\r\nwhich was greatly felt. A gunrack had been made for the firearms, which\r\nwere kept with extreme care, and neither tables nor cupboards were left\r\nincomplete. They sawed, they planed, they filed, they turned; and during\r\nthe whole of this bad season, nothing was heard but the grinding\r\nof tools or the humming of the turning-lathe which responded to the\r\ngrowling of the thunder.\r\n\r\nMaster Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the back,\r\nnear the storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good\r\nlitter, which perfectly suited his taste.\r\n\r\n“With good old Jup there is never any quarreling,” often repeated\r\nPencroft, “never any improper reply. What a servant, Neb, what a\r\nservant!”\r\n\r\nOf course Jup was now well used to service. He brushed their clothes,\r\nhe turned the spit, he waited at table, he swept the rooms, he gathered\r\nwood, and he performed another admirable piece of service which\r\ndelighted Pencroft--he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck\r\nup the worthy sailor in his bed.\r\n\r\nAs to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana,\r\nquadrumana or quadrupeds, it left nothing to be desired. With their life\r\nin the open air, on this salubrious soil, under that temperate zone,\r\nworking both with head and hands, they could not suppose that illness\r\nwould ever attack them.\r\n\r\nAll were indeed wonderfully well. Herbert had already grown two inches\r\nin the year. His figure was forming and becoming more manly, and he\r\npromised to be an accomplished man, physically as well as morally.\r\nBesides he improved himself during the leisure hours which manual\r\noccupations left to him; he read the books found in the case; and after\r\nthe practical lessons which were taught by the very necessity of their\r\nposition, he found in the engineer for science, and the reporter for\r\nlanguages, masters who were delighted to complete his education.\r\n\r\nThe tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained covered\r\nwith clouds during the whole of this last summer month. The atmosphere,\r\nviolently agitated by the electric commotions, could not recover its\r\nformer purity, and there was almost invariably rain and fog, except for\r\nthree or four fine days on which several excursions were made. About\r\nthis time the female onager gave birth to a young one which belonged to\r\nthe same sex as its mother, and which throve capitally. In the corral,\r\nthe flock of musmons had also increased, and several lambs already\r\nbleated in the sheds, to the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who had\r\neach their favorite among these newcomers. An attempt was also made\r\nfor the domestication of the peccaries, which succeeded well. A sty was\r\nconstructed under the poultry-yard, and soon contained several young\r\nones in the way to become civilized, that is to say, to become fat\r\nunder Neb’s care. Master Jup, entrusted with carrying them their\r\ndaily nourishment, leavings from the kitchen, etc., acquitted himself\r\nconscientiously of his task. He sometimes amused himself at the expense\r\nof his little pensioners by tweaking their tails; but this was mischief,\r\nand not wickedness, for these little twisted tails amused him like a\r\nplaything, and his instinct was that of a child. One day in this month\r\nof March, Pencroft, talking to the engineer, reminded Cyrus Harding of a\r\npromise which the latter had not as yet had time to fulfil.\r\n\r\n“You once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long\r\nladders at Granite House, captain,” said he; “won’t you make it some\r\nday?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, captain. After we have given ourselves necessaries, let us\r\nthink a little of luxury. For us it may be luxury, if you like, but\r\nfor things it is necessary. It isn’t very convenient to climb up a long\r\nladder when one is heavily loaded.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Pencroft, we will try to please you,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“But you have no machine at your disposal.”\r\n\r\n“We will make one.”\r\n\r\n“A steam machine?”\r\n\r\n“No, a water machine.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural force\r\nat the disposal of the engineer which could be used without great\r\ndifficulty. For this, it was enough to augment the flow of the little\r\nstream which supplied the interior of Granite House with water. The\r\nopening among the stones and grass was then increased, thus producing\r\na strong fall at the bottom of the passage, the overflow from which\r\nescaped by the inner well. Below this fall the engineer fixed a cylinder\r\nwith paddles, which was joined on the exterior with a strong cable\r\nrolled on a wheel, supporting a basket. In this way, by means of a long\r\nrope reaching to the ground, which enabled them to regulate the motive\r\npower, they could rise in the basket to the door of Granite House.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first time, and\r\ngave universal satisfaction. Henceforward all the loads, wood, coal,\r\nprovisions, and even the settlers themselves, were hoisted by this\r\nsimple system, which replaced the primitive ladder, and, as may be\r\nsupposed, no one thought of regretting the change. Top particularly was\r\nenchanted with this improvement, for he had not, and never could have\r\npossessed Master Jup’s skill in climbing ladders, and often it was on\r\nNeb’s back, or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to\r\nmake the ascent to Granite House. About this time, too, Cyrus Harding\r\nattempted to manufacture glass, and he at first put the old pottery-kiln\r\nto this new use. There were some difficulties to be encountered; but,\r\nafter several fruitless attempts, he succeeded in setting up a glass\r\nmanufactory, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert, his usual assistants, did\r\nnot leave for several days. As to the substances used in the composition\r\nof glass, they are simply sand, chalk, and soda, either carbonate or\r\nsulphate. Now the beach supplied sand, lime supplied chalk, sea-weeds\r\nsupplied soda, pyrites supplied sulphuric acid, and the ground supplied\r\ncoal to heat the kiln to the wished-for temperature. Cyrus Harding thus\r\nsoon had everything ready for setting to work.\r\n\r\nThe tool, the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty, was\r\nthe pipe of the glass-maker, an iron tube, five or six feet long, which\r\ncollects on one end the material in a state of fusion. But by means of\r\na long, thin piece of iron rolled up like the barrel of a gun, Pencroft\r\nsucceeded in making a tube soon ready for use.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of March the tube was heated. A hundred parts of sand,\r\nthirty-five of chalk, forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with two or three\r\nparts of powdered coal, composed the substance, which was placed in\r\ncrucibles. When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a\r\nliquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding collected with the tube\r\na quantity of the paste: he turned it about on a metal plate, previously\r\narranged, so as to give it a form suitable for blowing, then he passed\r\nthe tube to Herbert, telling him to blow at the other extremity.\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well into the\r\ntube-taking care to twirl it round at the same time--that his breath\r\ndilated the glassy mass. Other quantities of the substance in a state\r\nof fusion were added to the first, and in a short time the result was a\r\nbubble which measured a foot in diameter. Harding then took the tube\r\nout of Herbert’s hands, and, giving it a pendulous motion, he ended by\r\nlengthening the malleable bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic shape.\r\n\r\nThe blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two\r\nhemispheric caps, which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron\r\ndipped in cold water; then, by the same proceeding, this cylinder was\r\ncut lengthways, and after having been rendered malleable by a second\r\nheating, it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller.\r\n\r\nThe first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to perform this\r\noperation fifty times to have fifty panes. The windows at Granite House\r\nwere soon furnished with panes; not very white, perhaps, but still\r\nsufficiently transparent.\r\n\r\nAs to bottles and tumblers, that was only play. They were satisfied with\r\nthem, besides, just as they came from the end of the tube. Pencroft had\r\nasked to be allowed to “blow” in his turn, and it was great fun for\r\nhim; but he blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous\r\nshapes, which he admired immensely.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered the forest\r\nof the Far West, on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as usual, the\r\nlad was asking a thousand questions of the engineer, who answered them\r\nheartily. Now, as Harding was not a sportsman, and as, on the other\r\nside, Herbert was talking chemistry and natural philosophy, numbers of\r\nkangaroos, capybaras, and agouties came within range, which, however,\r\nescaped the lad’s gun; the consequence was that the day was already\r\nadvanced, and the two hunters were in danger of having made a\r\nuseless excursion, when Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy,\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Oh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?” and he pointed to a shrub,\r\nrather than a tree, for it was composed of a single stem, covered with a\r\nscaly bark, which bore leaves streaked with little parallel veins.\r\n\r\n“And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?” asked Harding.\r\n\r\n“It is a ‘cycas revoluta,’ of which I have a picture in our dictionary\r\nof Natural History!” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“But I can’t see any fruit on this shrub!” observed his companion.\r\n\r\n“No, captain,” replied Herbert; “but its stem contains a flour with\r\nwhich nature has provided us all ready ground.”\r\n\r\n“It is, then, the bread-tree?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the bread-tree.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy,” replied the engineer, “this is a valuable discovery,\r\nsince our wheat harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you are not\r\nmistaken!”\r\n\r\nHerbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which was\r\ncomposed of a glandulous tissue, containing a quantity of floury pith,\r\ntraversed with woody fiber, separated by rings of the same substance,\r\narranged concentrically. With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous\r\njuice of disagreeable flavor, but which it would be easy to get rid of\r\nby pressure. This cellular substance was regular flour of a superior\r\nquality, extremely nourishing; its exportation was formerly forbidden by\r\nthe Japanese laws.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of the Far\r\nWest where the cycas grew, took their bearings, and returned to Granite\r\nHouse, where they made known their discovery.\r\n\r\nThe next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to Granite\r\nHouse with an ample supply of cycas stems. The engineer constructed a\r\npress, with which to extract the mucilaginous juice mingled with the\r\nfecula, and he obtained a large quantity of flour, which Neb soon\r\ntransformed into cakes and puddings. This was not quite real wheaten\r\nbread, but it was very like it.\r\n\r\nNow, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished\r\ndaily the milk necessary to the colony. The cart, or rather a sort of\r\nlight carriole which had replaced it, made frequent journeys to the\r\ncorral, and when it was Pencroft’s turn to go he took Jup, and let him\r\ndrive, and Jup, cracking his whip, acquitted himself with his customary\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nEverything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House, and\r\ncertainly the settlers, if it had not been that they were so far from\r\ntheir native land, had no reason to complain. They were so well suited\r\nto this life, and were, besides, so accustomed to the island, that they\r\ncould not have left its hospitable soil without regret!\r\n\r\nAnd yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the heart of\r\nman, that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island, the\r\ncolonists would have made signals, would have attracted her attention,\r\nand would have departed!\r\n\r\nIt was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and his\r\ncompanions sanctified by rest and prayer. The day was fine, such as an\r\nOctober day in the Northern Hemisphere might be.\r\n\r\nAll, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the veranda\r\non the edge of Prospect Heights, and they were watching the\r\ndarkness creeping up from the horizon. Some cups of the infusion of\r\nelder-berries, which took the place of coffee, had been served by Neb.\r\nThey were speaking of the island and of its isolated situation in the\r\nPacific, which led Gideon Spilett to say,--\r\n\r\n“My dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant found in\r\nthe case, again taken the position of our island?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument,\r\nwhich is more perfect than that which you before used.”\r\n\r\n“What is the good?” said Pencroft. “The island is quite comfortable\r\nwhere it is!”\r\n\r\n“Well, who knows,” returned the reporter, “who knows but that we may be\r\nmuch nearer inhabited land than we think?”\r\n\r\n“We shall know to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and if it had not\r\nbeen for the occupations which left me no leisure, we should have known\r\nit already.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Pencroft. “The captain is too good an observer to be\r\nmistaken, and, if it has not moved from its place, the island is just\r\nwhere he put it.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see.”\r\n\r\nOn the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the engineer made\r\nthe necessary observations to verify the position which he had\r\nalready obtained, and this was the result of his operation. His first\r\nobservation had given him the situation of Lincoln Island,--\r\n\r\n\r\nIn west longitude: from 150deg. to 155deg.;\r\n\r\nIn south latitude: from 30deg. to 35deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second gave exactly:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn longitude: 150deg. 30’\r\n\r\nIn south latitude: 34deg. 57’\r\n\r\nSo then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus\r\nHarding had operated with so much skill that his error did not exceed\r\nfive degrees.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Gideon Spilett, “since we possess an atlas as well as a\r\nsextant, let us see, my dear Cyrus, the exact position which Lincoln\r\nIsland occupies in the Pacific.”\r\n\r\nHerbert fetched the atlas, and the map of the Pacific was opened, and\r\nthe engineer, compass in hand, prepared to determine their position.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the compasses stopped, and he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n“But an island exists in this part of the Pacific already!”\r\n\r\n“An island?” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“An important island?”\r\n\r\n“No, an islet lost in the Pacific, and which perhaps has never been\r\nvisited.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we will visit it,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“We?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, captain. We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to\r\nsteer her. At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?”\r\n\r\n“About a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\n“A hundred and fifty miles! And what’s that?” returned Pencroft. “In\r\nforty-eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!”\r\n\r\nAnd, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed\r\nin time to be launched towards the month of next October, on the return\r\nof the fine season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nWhen Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace till it\r\nwas executed. Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a boat of a\r\ncertain size was necessary for this voyage, he determined to build one.\r\n\r\nWhat wood should he employ? Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the\r\nisland? They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but which\r\nstands water as well as the elm.\r\n\r\nThese details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season would\r\nnot return before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft should work\r\nalone at the boat. Gideon Spilett and Herbert were to continue to\r\nhunt, and neither Neb nor Master Jup, his assistant, were to leave the\r\ndomestic duties which had devolved upon them.\r\n\r\nDirectly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of their\r\nbranches, and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have been able\r\nto do it. A week after, in the recess between the Chimneys and the\r\ncliff, a dockyard was prepared, and a keel five-and-thirty feet long,\r\nfurnished with a stern-post at the stern and a stem at the bows, lay\r\nalong the sand.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade. He knew as\r\nmuch about ship-building as about nearly everything else, and he had\r\nat first drawn the model of his ship on paper. Besides, he was ably\r\nseconded by Pencroft, who, having worked for several years in a dockyard\r\nin Brooklyn, knew the practical part of the trade. It was not until\r\nafter careful calculation and deep thought that the timbers were laid on\r\nthe keel.\r\n\r\nPencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his new\r\nenterprise, and would not leave his work for an instant.\r\n\r\nA single thing had the honor of drawing him, but for one day only, from\r\nhis dockyard. This was the second wheat-harvest, which was gathered in\r\non the 15th of April. It was as much a success as the first, and yielded\r\nthe number of grains which had been predicted.\r\n\r\n“Five bushels, captain,” said Pencroft, after having scrupulously\r\nmeasured his treasure.\r\n\r\n“Five bushels,” replied the engineer; “and a hundred and thirty thousand\r\ngrains a bushel will make six hundred and fifty thousand grains.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we will sow them all this time,” said the sailor, “except a\r\nlittle in reserve.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pencroft, and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield, we\r\nshall have four thousand bushels.”\r\n\r\n“And shall we eat bread?”\r\n\r\n“We shall eat bread.”\r\n\r\n“But we must have a mill.\r\n\r\n“We will make one.”\r\n\r\nThe third corn-field was very much larger than the two first, and the\r\nsoil, prepared with extreme care, received the precious seed. That done,\r\nPencroft returned to his work.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood, and\r\nthey ventured deep into the still unknown parts of the Far West, their\r\nguns loaded with ball, ready for any dangerous emergency. It was a vast\r\nthicket of magnificent trees, crowded together as if pressed for room.\r\nThe exploration of these dense masses of wood was difficult in\r\nthe extreme, and the reporter never ventured there without the\r\npocket-compass, for the sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage\r\nand it would have been very difficult for them to retrace their way.\r\nIt naturally happened that game was more rare in those situations where\r\nthere was hardly sufficient room to move; two or three large herbivorous\r\nanimals were however killed during the last fortnight of April. These\r\nwere koalas, specimens of which the settlers had already seen to the\r\nnorth of the lake, and which stupidly allowed themselves to be killed\r\namong the thick branches of the trees in which they took refuge. Their\r\nskins were brought back to Granite House, and there, by the help of\r\nsulphuric acid, they were subjected to a sort of tanning process which\r\nrendered them capable of being used.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the Far\r\nWest, when the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived in\r\na sort of clearing, into which the trees more sparsely scattered had\r\npermitted a few rays to penetrate. Gideon Spilett was at first surprised\r\nat the odor which exhaled from certain plants with straight stalks,\r\nround and branchy, bearing grape-like clusters of flowers and very small\r\nberries. The reporter broke off one or two of these stalks and returned\r\nto the lad, to whom he said,--\r\n\r\n“What can this be, Herbert?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert, “this is a treasure which will secure\r\nyou Pencroft’s gratitude forever.”\r\n\r\n“Is it tobacco?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none the less\r\ntobacco!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, good old Pencroft! Won’t he be pleased! But we must not let him\r\nsmoke it all, he must give us our share.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! an idea occurs to me, Mr. Spilett,” replied Herbert. “Don’t let us\r\nsay anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves, and one fine\r\nday we will present him with a pipe already filled!”\r\n\r\n“All right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will have\r\nnothing left to wish for in this world.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious plant, and\r\nthen returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it in with as much\r\nprecaution as if Pencroft had been the most vigilant and severe of\r\ncustom-house officers.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor\r\nsuspected nothing during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long,\r\nwhich was required in order to dry the small leaves, chop them up, and\r\nsubject them to a certain torrefaction on hot stones. This took two\r\nmonths; but all these manipulations were successfully carried on unknown\r\nto Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his boat, he only\r\nreturned to Granite House at the hour of rest.\r\n\r\nFor some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three miles\r\nout in the open sea swimming around Lincoln Island. This was a whale\r\nof the largest size, which apparently belonged to the southern species,\r\ncalled the “Cape Whale.”\r\n\r\n“What a lucky chance it would be if we could capture it!” cried the\r\nsailor. “Ah! if we only had a proper boat and a good harpoon, I would\r\nsay ‘After the beast,’ for he would be well worth the trouble of\r\ncatching!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Pencroft,” observed Harding, “I should much like to watch you\r\nhandling a harpoon. It would be very interesting.”\r\n\r\n“I am astonished,” said the reporter, “to see a whale in this\r\ncomparatively high latitude.”\r\n\r\n“Why so, Mr. Spilett?” replied Herbert. “We are exactly in that part of\r\nthe Pacific which English and American whalemen call the whale field,\r\nand it is here, between New Zealand and South America, that the whales\r\nof the Southern Hemisphere are met with in the greatest numbers.”\r\n\r\nAnd Pencroft returned to his work, not without uttering a sigh of\r\nregret, for every sailor is a born fisherman, and if the pleasure of\r\nfishing is in exact proportion to the size of the animal, one can judge\r\nhow a whaler feels in sight of a whale. And if this had only been for\r\npleasure! But they could not help feeling how valuable such a prize\r\nwould have been to the colony, for the oil, fat, and bones would have\r\nbeen put to many uses.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that this whale appeared to have no wish to leave the\r\nwaters of the island. Therefore, whether from the windows of Granite\r\nHouse, or from Prospect Heights, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, when they\r\nwere not hunting, or Neb, unless presiding over his fires, never left\r\nthe telescope, but watched all the animal’s movements. The cetacean,\r\nhaving entered far into Union Bay, made rapid furrows across it from\r\nMandible Cape to Claw Cape, propelled by its enormously powerful flukes,\r\non which it supported itself, and making its way through the water\r\nat the rate little short of twelve knots. Sometimes also it\r\napproached so near to the island that it could be clearly distinguished.\r\nIt was the southern whale, which is completely black, the head being\r\nmore depressed than that of the northern whale.\r\n\r\nThey could also see it throwing up from its air-holes to a great\r\nheight a cloud of vapor, or of water, for, strange as it may appear,\r\nnaturalists and whalers are not agreed on this subject. Is it air or is\r\nit water which is thus driven out? It is generally admitted to be vapor,\r\nwhich, condensing suddenly by contact with the cold air, falls again as\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nHowever, the presence of this mammifer preoccupied the colonists. It\r\nirritated Pencroft especially, as he could think of nothing else while\r\nat work. He ended by longing for it, like a child for a thing which it\r\nhas been denied. At night he talked about it in his sleep, and certainly\r\nif he had had the means of attacking it, if the sloop had been in a fit\r\nstate to put to sea, he would not have hesitated to set out in pursuit.\r\n\r\nBut what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did for them,\r\nand on the 3rd of May shouts from Neb, who had stationed himself at the\r\nkitchen window, announced that the whale was stranded on the beach of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nHerbert and Gideon Spilett, who were just about to set out hunting,\r\nleft their guns, Pencroft threw down his ax, and Harding and Neb joining\r\ntheir companions, all rushed towards the scene of action.\r\n\r\nThe stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point, three miles\r\nfrom Granite House, and at high tide. It was therefore probable that the\r\ncetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily; at any rate it\r\nwas best to hasten, so as to cut off its retreat if necessary. They ran\r\nwith pick-axes and iron-tipped poles in their hands, passed over the\r\nMercy bridge, descended the right bank of the river, along the beach,\r\nand in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous\r\nanimal, above which flocks of birds already hovered.\r\n\r\n“What a monster!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\nAnd the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale, eighty\r\nfeet long, a giant of the species, probably not weighing less than a\r\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds!\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor attempt by\r\nstruggling to regain the water while the tide was still high.\r\n\r\nIt was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left side.\r\n\r\n“There are whalers in these quarters, then?” said Gideon Spilett\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn’t prove anything!” replied Pencroft.\r\n“Whales have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in\r\nthe side, and this one might even have been struck in the north of the\r\nAtlantic and come to die in the south of the Pacific, and it would be\r\nnothing astonishing.”\r\n\r\nPencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal’s side, read this\r\ninscription on it:\r\n\r\n\r\n           MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD\r\n\r\n\r\n“A vessel from the Vineyard! A ship from my country!” he cried. “The\r\n‘Maria Stella!’ A fine whaler, ‘pon my word; I know her well! Oh, my\r\nfriends, a vessel from the Vineyard!--a whaler from the Vineyard!”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor brandishing the harpoon, repeated, not without emotion,\r\nthe name which he loved so well--the name of his birthplace.\r\n\r\nBut as it could not be expected that the “Maria Stella” would come to\r\nreclaim the animal harpooned by her, they resolved to begin cutting it\r\nup before decomposition should commence. The birds, who had watched\r\nthis rich prey for several days, had determined to take possession of it\r\nwithout further delay, and it was necessary to drive them off by firing\r\nat them repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThe whale was a female, and a large quantity of milk was taken from it,\r\nwhich, according to the opinion of the naturalist Duffenbach, might pass\r\nfor cow’s milk, and, indeed, it differs from it neither in taste, color,\r\nnor density.\r\n\r\nPencroft had formerly served on board a whaling-ship, and he could\r\nmethodically direct the operation of cutting up, a sufficiently\r\ndisagreeable operation lasting three days, but from which the settlers\r\ndid not flinch, not even Gideon Spilett, who, as the sailor said, would\r\nend by making a “real good castaway.”\r\n\r\nThe blubber, cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness,\r\nthen divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each,\r\nwas melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot, for they did\r\nnot wish to taint the environs of Granite House, and in this fusion it\r\nlost nearly a third of its weight.\r\n\r\nBut there was an immense quantity of it; the tongue alone yielded six\r\nthousand pounds of oil, and the lower lip four thousand. Then, besides\r\nthe fat, which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and\r\nglycerine, there were still the bones, for which a use could doubtless\r\nbe found, although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at\r\nGranite House. The upper part of the mouth of the cetacean was, indeed,\r\nprovided on both sides with eight hundred horny blades, very elastic,\r\nof a fibrous texture, and fringed at the edge like great combs, at which\r\nthe teeth, six feet long, served to retain the thousands of animalculae,\r\nlittle fish, and molluscs, on which the whale fed.\r\n\r\nThe operation finished, to the great satisfaction of the operators, the\r\nremains of the animal were left to the birds, who would soon make every\r\nvestige of it disappear, and their usual daily occupations were resumed\r\nby the inmates of Granite House.\r\n\r\nHowever, before returning to the dockyard, Cyrus Harding conceived\r\nthe idea of fabricating certain machines, which greatly excited the\r\ncuriosity of his companions. He took a dozen of the whale’s bones, cut\r\nthem into six equal parts, and sharpened their ends.\r\n\r\n“This machine is not my own invention, and it is frequently employed\r\nby the Aleutian hunters in Russian America. You see these bones, my\r\nfriends; well, when it freezes, I will bend them, and then wet them\r\nwith water till they are entirely covered with ice, which will keep them\r\nbent, and I will strew them on the snow, having previously covered them\r\nwith fat. Now, what will happen if a hungry animal swallows one of these\r\nbaits? Why, the heat of his stomach will melt the ice, and the bone,\r\nspringing straight, will pierce him with its sharp points.”\r\n\r\n“Well! I do call that ingenious!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“And it will spare the powder and shot,” rejoined Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“That will be better than traps!” added Neb.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the boat-building progressed, and towards the end of\r\nthe month half the planking was completed. It could already be seen that\r\nher shape was excellent, and that she would sail well.\r\n\r\nPencroft worked with unparalleled ardor, and only a sturdy frame could\r\nhave borne such fatigue; but his companions were preparing in secret a\r\nreward for his labors, and on the 31st of May he was to meet with one of\r\nthe greatest joys of his life.\r\n\r\nOn that day, after dinner, just as he was about to leave the table,\r\nPencroft felt a hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was the hand of Gideon Spilett, who said,--\r\n\r\n“One moment, Master Pencroft, you mustn’t sneak off like that! You’ve\r\nforgotten your dessert.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “I am going back to my\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“Well, a cup of coffee, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing more.”\r\n\r\n“A pipe, then?”\r\n\r\nPencroft jumped up, and his great good-natured face grew pale when he\r\nsaw the reporter presenting him with a ready-filled pipe, and Herbert\r\nwith a glowing coal.\r\n\r\nThe sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word; so,\r\nseizing the pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the coal,\r\nhe drew five or six great whiffs. A fragrant blue cloud soon arose, and\r\nfrom its depths a voice was heard repeating excitedly,--\r\n\r\n“Tobacco! real tobacco!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pencroft,” returned Cyrus Harding, “and very good tobacco too!”\r\n\r\n“O, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!” cried the sailor.\r\n“Nothing more is now wanting to our island.”\r\n\r\nAnd Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked.\r\n\r\n“And who made this discovery?” he asked at length. “You, Herbert, no\r\ndoubt?”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Spilett!” exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and clasping\r\nhim to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never felt anything\r\nlike it before.\r\n\r\n“Oh Pencroft,” said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, “a truce for\r\none moment. You must share your gratitude with Herbert, who recognized\r\nthe plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with Neb, who took a great\r\ndeal of trouble to keep our secret.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my friends, I will repay you some day,” replied the sailor. “Now\r\nwe are friends for life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nWinter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of the\r\nnorthern zones, and the great business was the making of warm and solid\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nThe musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and this\r\nprecious textile material was now to be transformed into stuff.\r\n\r\nOf course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders,\r\ncombers, polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor self-acting\r\nmachine to spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was obliged to proceed\r\nin a simpler way, so as to do without spinning and weaving. And indeed\r\nhe proposed to make use of the property which the filaments of wool\r\npossess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together, and of\r\nmanufacturing by this simple process the material called felt. This felt\r\ncould then be obtained by a simple operation which, if it diminished\r\nthe flexibility of the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in\r\nproportion. Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very\r\nshort hairs, and was in a good condition to be felted.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who was once\r\nmore obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary operations,\r\nthe subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance\r\nwith which it is impregnated, and which is called grease. This cleaning\r\nwas done in vats filled with water, which was maintained at the\r\ntemperature of seventy degrees, and in which the wool was soaked for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda,\r\nand, when sufficiently dried by pressure, it was in a state to be\r\ncompressed, that is to say, to produce a solid material, rough, no\r\ndoubt, and such as would have no value in a manufacturing center of\r\nEurope or America, but which would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln\r\nIsland markets.\r\n\r\nThis sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times,\r\nand, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process\r\nwhich Harding was now about to employ. Where Harding’s engineering\r\nqualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine\r\nfor pressing the wool; for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit\r\nthe mechanical force, hitherto unused, which the waterfall on the beach\r\npossessed to move a fulling-mill.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in troughs, and\r\nupon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was the machine in\r\nquestion, and such it had been for centuries until the time when the\r\nmallets were replaced by cylinders of compression, and the material was\r\nno longer subjected to beating, but to regular rolling.\r\n\r\nThe operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete success.\r\nThe wool, previously impregnated with a solution of soap, intended on\r\nthe one hand to facilitate the interlacing, the compression, and the\r\nsoftening of the wool, and on the other to prevent its diminution by\r\nthe beating, issued from the mill in the shape of thick felt cloth. The\r\nroughnesses with which the staple of wool is naturally filled were so\r\nthoroughly entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed\r\nequally suitable either for garments or bedclothes. It was certainly\r\nneither merino, muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor\r\nflannel. It was “Lincolnian felt,” and Lincoln Island possessed yet\r\nanother manufacture. The colonists had now warm garments and thick\r\nbedclothes, and they could without fear await the approach of the winter\r\nof 1866-67.\r\n\r\nThe severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to his\r\ngreat regret, Pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat-building, which\r\nhe hoped to finish in time for next spring.\r\n\r\nThe sailor’s great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor\r\nIsland, although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply for\r\ncuriosity’s sake, for there was evidently nothing to be found on this\r\ndesert and almost arid rock. A voyage of a hundred and fifty miles in a\r\ncomparatively small vessel, over unknown seas, could not but cause him\r\nsome anxiety. Suppose that their vessel, once out at sea, should be\r\nunable to reach Tabor Island, and could not return to Lincoln Island,\r\nwhat would become of her in the midst of the Pacific, so fruitful of\r\ndisasters?\r\n\r\nHarding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he found him\r\nstrangely bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which determination he\r\nhimself could give no sufficient reason.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the engineer one day to him, “I must observe, my friend,\r\nthat after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after\r\nhaving spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged\r\nto forsake it, you are the first to wish to leave it.”\r\n\r\n“Only to leave it for a few days,” replied Pencroft, “only for a few\r\ndays, captain. Time to go and come back, and see what that islet is\r\nlike!”\r\n\r\n“But it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“I know that beforehand.”\r\n\r\n“Then why venture there?”\r\n\r\n“To know what is going on in Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“But nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there.”\r\n\r\n“Who knows?”\r\n\r\n“And if you are caught in a hurricane?”\r\n\r\n“There is no fear of that in the fine season,” replied Pencroft.\r\n“But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your\r\npermission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage.”\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor’s\r\nshoulder, “if any misfortune happens to you, or to this lad, whom\r\nchance has made our child, do you think we could ever cease to blame\r\nourselves?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding,” replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence, “we\r\nshall not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further of this\r\nvoyage, when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when you have seen\r\nour tight-rigged little craft, when you have observed how she behaves at\r\nsea, when we sail round our island, for we will do so together--I fancy,\r\nI say, that you will no longer hesitate to let me go. I don’t conceal\r\nfrom you that your boat will be a masterpiece.”\r\n\r\n“Say ‘our’ boat, at least, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, disarmed for\r\nthe moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed later on, without\r\nconvincing either the sailor or the engineer.\r\n\r\nThe first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The corral had\r\npreviously been largely supplied with stores, so that daily visits to\r\nit were not requisite; but it was decided that more than a week should\r\nnever be allowed to pass without someone going to it.\r\n\r\nTraps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding were\r\ntried. The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and covered\r\nwith a thick outer layer of fat, were placed on the border of the forest\r\nat a spot where animals usually passed on their way to the lake.\r\n\r\nTo the engineer’s great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the\r\nAleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a few wild\r\nboars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the animals being\r\nfound dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent bones.\r\n\r\nAn incident must here be related, not only as interesting in itself, but\r\nbecause it was the first attempt made by the colonists to communicate\r\nwith the rest of mankind.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into\r\nthe sea a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents might perhaps\r\ncarry to an inhabited coast, or to confide it to pigeons.\r\n\r\nBut how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or bottles could\r\ncross the distance of twelve hundred miles which separated the island\r\nfrom any inhabited land? It would have been pure folly.\r\n\r\nBut on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without\r\ndifficulty, of an albatross, which a shot from Herbert’s gun had\r\nslightly wounded in the foot. It was a magnificent bird, measuring ten\r\nfeet from wing to wing, and which could traverse seas as wide as the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nHerbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound would\r\nsoon heal, and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett explained to\r\nhim that they should not neglect this opportunity of attempting to\r\ncommunicate by this messenger with the lands of the Pacific; for if the\r\nalbatross had come from some inhabited region, there was no doubt but\r\nthat it would return there so soon as it was set free.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist sometimes\r\ncame to the surface, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending\r\nforth to take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures\r\nof the settlers in Lincoln Island. What a success for the authorized\r\nreporter of the New York Herald, and for the number which should contain\r\nthe article, if it should ever reach the address of its editor, the\r\nHonorable James Bennett!\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was placed in a\r\nstrong waterproof bag, with an earnest request to whoever might find it\r\nto forward it to the office of the New York Herald. This little bag was\r\nfastened to the neck of the albatross, and not to its foot, for these\r\nbirds are in the habit of resting on the surface of the sea; then\r\nliberty was given to this swift courier of the air, and it was not\r\nwithout some emotion that the colonists watched it disappear in the\r\nmisty west.\r\n\r\n“Where is he going to?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Towards New Zealand,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“A good voyage to you,” shouted the sailor, who himself did not expect\r\nany great result from this mode of correspondence.\r\n\r\nWith the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of Granite House,\r\nmending clothes and different occupations, among others making the sails\r\nfor their vessel, which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon-case.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no lack of\r\neither wood or coal. Cyrus Harding had established a second fireplace in\r\nthe dining-room, and there the long winter evenings were spent. Talking\r\nwhile they worked, reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed\r\nwith profit to all.\r\n\r\nIt was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well lighted\r\nwith candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner, elderberry\r\ncoffee smoking in the cups, the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke,\r\nthey could hear the storm howling without. Their comfort would have been\r\ncomplete, if complete comfort could ever exist for those who are far\r\nfrom their fellow-creatures, and without any means of communication with\r\nthem. They often talked of their country, of the friends whom they had\r\nleft, of the grandeur of the American Republic, whose influence could\r\nnot but increase; and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the\r\naffairs of the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals,\r\nhis views, and his prognostics.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that Spilett was led to say--\r\n\r\n“But now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial movement\r\nto which you predict a continual advance, does it not run the danger of\r\nbeing sooner or later completely stopped?”\r\n\r\n“Stopped! And by what?”\r\n\r\n“By the want of coal, which may justly be called the most precious of\r\nminerals.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the most precious indeed,” replied the engineer; “and it would\r\nseem that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the diamond,\r\nwhich is simply pure carbon crystallized.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean to say, captain,” interrupted Pencroft, “that we burn\r\ndiamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?”\r\n\r\n“No, my friend,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\n“However,” resumed Gideon Spilett, “you do not deny that some day the\r\ncoal will be entirely consumed?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred\r\nthousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of\r\nhundredweights have not nearly exhausted them.”\r\n\r\n“With the increasing consumption of coal,” replied Gideon Spilett, “it\r\ncan be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two\r\nhundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon worked more\r\nthoroughly with new machines, the American and Australian mines will for\r\na long time yet provide for the consumption in trade.”\r\n\r\n“For how long a time?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years.”\r\n\r\n“That is reassuring for us, but a bad look-out for our\r\ngreat-grandchildren!” observed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“They will discover something else,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“It is to be hoped so,” answered Spilett, “for without coal there would\r\nbe no machinery, and without machinery there would be no railways, no\r\nsteamers, no manufactories, nothing of that which is indispensable to\r\nmodern civilization!”\r\n\r\n“But what will they find?” asked Pencroft. “Can you guess, captain?”\r\n\r\n“Nearly, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“And what will they burn instead of coal?”\r\n\r\n“Water,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\n“Water!” cried Pencroft, “water as fuel for steamers and engines! water\r\nto heat water!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements,” replied Cyrus\r\nHarding, “and decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which will then have\r\nbecome a powerful and manageable force, for all great discoveries, by\r\nsome inexplicable laws, appear to agree and become complete at the same\r\ntime. Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed\r\nas fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or\r\ntogether, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of\r\nan intensity of which coal is not capable. Some day the coalrooms of\r\nsteamers and the tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored\r\nwith these two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with\r\nenormous calorific power. There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long\r\nas the earth is inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants,\r\nand there will be no want of either light or heat as long as the\r\nproductions of the vegetable, mineral or animal kingdoms do not fail us.\r\nI believe, then, that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall\r\nheat and warm ourselves with water. Water will be the coal of the\r\nfuture.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to see that,” observed the sailor.\r\n\r\n“You were born too soon, Pencroft,” returned Neb, who only took part in\r\nthe discussion by these words.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not Neb’s speech which interrupted the conversation, but\r\nTop’s barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which\r\nhad before perplexed the engineer. At the same time Top began to run\r\nround the mouth of the well, which opened at the extremity of the\r\ninterior passage.\r\n\r\n“What can Top be barking in that way for?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“And Jup be growling like that?” added Herbert.\r\n\r\nIn fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of agitation,\r\nand, singular to say, the two animals appeared more uneasy than angry.\r\n\r\n“It is evident,” said Gideon Spilett, “that this well is in direct\r\ncommunication with the sea, and that some marine animal comes from time\r\nto time to breathe at the bottom.”\r\n\r\n“That’s evident,” replied the sailor, “and there can be no other\r\nexplanation to give. Quiet there, Top!” added Pencroft, turning to the\r\ndog, “and you, Jup, be off to your room!”\r\n\r\nThe ape and the dog were silent. Jup went off to bed, but Top remained\r\nin the room, and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the\r\nrest of the evening. There was no further talk on the subject, but the\r\nincident, however, clouded the brow of the engineer.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and\r\nfrost. The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter,\r\nand its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit. But although\r\nthis winter was less cold, it was more troubled by storms and squalls;\r\nthe sea besides often endangered the safety of the Chimneys. At times\r\nit almost seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows\r\nwhich thundered against the wall of Granite House.\r\n\r\nWhen the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge watery\r\nmasses breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but admire the\r\nmagnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury. The waves\r\nrebounded in dazzling foam, the beach entirely disapppearing under the\r\nraging flood, and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself, the\r\nspray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nDuring these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out,\r\nowing to the frequently falling trees; however, the colonists never\r\nallowed a week to pass without having paid a visit to the corral.\r\nHappily, this enclosure, sheltered by the southeastern spur of Mount\r\nFranklin, did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes,\r\nwhich spared its trees, sheds, and palisades; but the poultry-yard on\r\nProspect Heights, being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the\r\neast, suffered considerable damage. The pigeon-house was twice unroofed\r\nand the paling blown down. All this required to be remade more solidly\r\nthan before, for, as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in\r\none of the most dangerous parts of the Pacific. It really appeared as if\r\nit formed the central point of vast cyclones, which beat it perpetually\r\nas the whip does the top, only here it was the top which was motionless\r\nand the whip which moved. During the first week of the month of August\r\nthe weather became more moderate, and the atmosphere recovered the calm\r\nwhich it appeared to have lost forever. With the calm the cold again\r\nbecame intense, and the thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit,\r\nbelow zero.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several\r\ndays was made into the southeastern part of the island, towards Tadorn\r\nMarsh. The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their\r\nwinter quarters there. Wild duck, snipe, teal and grebe abounded there,\r\nand it was agreed that a day should be devoted to an expedition against\r\nthese birds.\r\n\r\nNot only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part\r\nin this excursion. Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some work as an excuse,\r\ndid not join them, but remained at Granite House.\r\n\r\nThe hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order to\r\nreach the marsh, after having promised to be back by the evening. Top\r\nand Jup accompanied them. As soon as they had passed over the Mercy\r\nBridge, the engineer raised it and returned, intending to put into\r\nexecution a project for the performance of which he wished to be alone.\r\n\r\nNow this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the mouth\r\nof which was on a level with the passage of Granite House, and which\r\ncommunicated with the sea, since it formerly supplied a way to the\r\nwaters of the lake.\r\n\r\nWhy did Top so often run round this opening? Why did he utter such\r\nstrange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this\r\nwell? Why did Jup join Top in a sort of common anxiety? Had this well\r\nbranches besides the communication with the sea? Did it spread towards\r\nother parts of the island? This is what Cyrus Harding wished to know. He\r\nhad resolved, therefore, to attempt the exploration of the well during\r\nthe absence of his companions, and an opportunity for doing so had now\r\npresented itself.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing the rope\r\nladder which had not been used since the establishment of the lift. The\r\nengineer drew the ladder to the hole, the diameter of which measured\r\nnearly six feet, and allowed it to unroll itself after having securely\r\nfastened its upper extremity. Then, having lighted a lantern, taken a\r\nrevolver, and placed a cutlass in his belt, he began the descent.\r\n\r\nThe sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out here and\r\nthere, and by means of these points it would have been quite possible\r\nfor an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well.\r\n\r\nThe engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined these\r\npoints by the light of his lantern, he could find no impression, no\r\nfracture which could give any reason to suppose that they had either\r\nrecently or at any former time been used as a staircase. Cyrus Harding\r\ndescended deeper, throwing the light of his lantern on all sides.\r\n\r\nHe saw nothing suspicious.\r\n\r\nWhen the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the water,\r\nwhich was then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in any other\r\npart of the well, did any passage open, which could lead to the interior\r\nof the cliff. The wall which Harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass\r\nsounded solid. It was compact granite, through which no living being\r\ncould force a way. To arrive at the bottom of the well and then climb\r\nup to its mouth it was necessary to pass through the channel under the\r\nrocky subsoil of the beach, which placed it in communication with the\r\nsea, and this was only possible for marine animals. As to the question\r\nof knowing where this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at\r\nwhat depth beneath the water, it could not be answered.\r\n\r\nThen Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew up the\r\nladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the\r\ndiningroom, saying to himself,--\r\n\r\n“I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nIn the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and\r\nbeing literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men\r\ncould possibly carry. Top wore a necklace of teal and Jup wreaths of\r\nsnipe round his body.\r\n\r\n“Here, master,” cried Neb; “here’s something to employ our time!\r\nPreserved and made into pies we shall have a welcome store! But I must\r\nhave some one to help me. I count on you, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“No, Neb,” replied the sailor; “I have the rigging of the vessel to\r\nfinish and to look after, and you will have to do without me.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Mr. Herbert?”\r\n\r\n“I must go to the corral to-morrow, Neb,” replied the lad.\r\n\r\n“It will be you then, Mr. Spilett, who will help me?”\r\n\r\n“To oblige you, Neb, I will,” replied the reporter; “but I warn you that\r\nif you disclose your recipes to me, I shall publish them.”\r\n\r\n“Whenever you like, Mr. Spilett,” replied Neb; “whenever you like.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb’s assistant and was\r\ninstalled in his culinary laboratory. The engineer had previously made\r\nknown to him the result of the exploration which he had made the day\r\nbefore, and on this point the reporter shared Harding’s opinion, that\r\nalthough he had found nothing, a secret still remained to be discovered!\r\n\r\nThe frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave\r\nGranite House unless to look after the poultry-yard. The dwelling\r\nwas filled with appetizing odors, which were emitted from the learned\r\nmanipulation of Neb and the reporter. But all the results of the chase\r\nwere not made into preserved provisions; and as the game kept perfectly\r\nin the intense cold, wild duck and other fowl were eaten fresh, and\r\ndeclared superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world.\r\n\r\nDuring this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the\r\nsailmaker’s needle with much skill, worked with such energy that the\r\nsails of the vessel were finished. There was no want of cordage. Thanks\r\nto the rigging which had been discovered with the case of the balloon,\r\nthe ropes and cables from the net were all of good quality, and the\r\nsailor turned them all to account. To the sails were attached strong\r\nbolt ropes, and there still remained enough from which to make the\r\nhalyards, shrouds, and sheets, etc. The blocks were manufactured by\r\nCyrus Harding under Pencroft’s directions by means of the turning lathe.\r\nIt therefore happened that the rigging was entirely prepared before the\r\nvessel was finished. Pencroft also manufactured a flag, that flag so\r\ndear to every true American, containing the stars and stripes of their\r\nglorious Union. The colors for it were supplied from certain plants\r\nused in dyeing, and which were very abundant in the island; only to the\r\nthirty-seven stars, representing the thirty-seven States of the Union,\r\nwhich shine on the American flag, the sailor added a thirty-eighth, the\r\nstar of “the State of Lincoln,” for he considered his island as already\r\nunited to the great republic. “And,” said he, “it is so already in\r\nheart, if not in deed!”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of Granite\r\nHouse, and the settlers saluted it with three cheers.\r\n\r\nThe cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this\r\nsecond winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when on the\r\nnight of the 11th of August, the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced\r\nwith complete destruction.\r\n\r\nAfter a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when towards four\r\no’clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by Top’s barking.\r\n\r\nThe dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well, but at\r\nthe threshold of the door, at which he was scratching as if he wished to\r\nburst it open. Jup was also uttering piercing cries.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Top!” cried Neb, who was the first awake. But the dog continued\r\nto bark more furiously than ever.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter now?” asked Harding.\r\n\r\nAnd all dressing in haste rushed to the windows, which they opened.\r\n\r\nBeneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the\r\ndim light. The settlers could see nothing, but they heard a singular\r\nyelping noise away in the darkness. It was evident that the beach had\r\nbeen invaded by a number of animals which could not be seen.\r\n\r\n“What are they?” cried Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Wolves, jaguars, or apes?” replied Neb.\r\n\r\n“They have nearly reached the plateau,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“And our poultry-yard,” exclaimed Herbert, “and our garden!”\r\n\r\n“Where can they have crossed?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“They must have crossed the bridge on the shore,” replied the engineer,\r\n“which one of us must have forgotten to close.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Spilett, “I remember having left it open.”\r\n\r\n“A fine job you have made of it, Mr. Spilett,” cried the sailor.\r\n\r\n“What is done cannot be undone,” replied Cyrus Harding. “We must consult\r\nwhat it will now be best to do.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged between\r\nHarding and his companions. It was certain that the bridge had been\r\ncrossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and that whatever\r\nthey might be they could by ascending the left bank of the Mercy reach\r\nProspect Heights. They must therefore be advanced against quickly and\r\nfought with if necessary.\r\n\r\n“But what are these beasts?” was asked a second time, as the yelpings\r\nwere again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made Herbert\r\nstart, and he remembered having heard them before during his first visit\r\nto the sources of the Red Creek.\r\n\r\n“They are colpeo foxes!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Forward!” shouted the sailor.\r\n\r\nAnd all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and revolvers, threw\r\nthemselves into the lift and soon set foot on the shore.\r\n\r\nColpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and irritated by\r\nhunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to throw themselves\r\ninto the midst of the troop, and their first shots vividly lighting up\r\nthe darkness made their assailants draw back.\r\n\r\nThe chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the\r\nplateau, for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been at\r\ntheir mercy, and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would inevitably\r\nbe the result, especially with regard to the corn-field. But as the\r\ninvasion of the plateau could only be made by the left bank of the\r\nMercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank\r\nbetween the river and the cliff of granite.\r\n\r\nThis was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding’s orders, they reached the\r\nspot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed fiercely through\r\nthe gloom. Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft and Neb posted\r\nthemselves in impregnable line. Top, his formidable jaws open, preceded\r\nthe colonists, and he was followed by Jup, armed with a knotty cudgel,\r\nwhich he brandished like a club.\r\n\r\nThe night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from the\r\nrevolvers as each person fired that they could see their assailants, who\r\nwere at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes were glowing like hot\r\ncoals.\r\n\r\n“They must not pass!” shouted Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“They shall not pass!” returned the engineer.\r\n\r\nBut if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it.\r\nThose in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was an\r\nincessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets. Several colpeos already\r\nlay dead on the ground, but their number did not appear to diminish,\r\nand it might have been supposed that reinforcements were continually\r\narriving over the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not without\r\nreceiving some wounds, though happily very slight ones. Herbert had,\r\nwith a shot from his revolver, rescued Neb, on whose back a colpeo had\r\nsprung like a tiger cat. Top fought with actual fury, flying at the\r\nthroats of the foxes and strangling them instantaneously. Jup wielded\r\nhis weapon valiantly, and it was in vain that they endeavored to keep\r\nhim in the rear. Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to\r\npierce the obscurity, he was always in the thick of the fight uttering\r\nfrom time to time--a sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of\r\ngreat rejoicing.\r\n\r\nAt one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a revolver\r\nhe was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with whom he was\r\ncoping with great coolness.\r\n\r\nHowever, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the side\r\nof the settlers, but not until they had fought for two long hours! The\r\nfirst signs of the approach of day doubtless determined the retreat of\r\ntheir assailants, who scampered away towards the North, passing over the\r\nbridge, which Neb ran immediately to raise. When day had sufficiently\r\nlighted up the field of battle, the settlers counted as many as fifty\r\ndead bodies scattered about on the shore.\r\n\r\n“And Jup!” cried Pencroft; “where is Jup?” Jup had disappeared. His\r\nfriend Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply to his\r\nfriend’s call.\r\n\r\nEveryone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found\r\namong the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the\r\nsnow with their blood. Jup was found in the midst of a heap of colpeos\r\nwhose broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that they had to do with the\r\nterrible club of the intrepid animal.\r\n\r\nPoor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel, but\r\ndeprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and his chest\r\nwas covered with severe wounds.\r\n\r\n“He is living,” cried Neb, who was bending over him.\r\n\r\n“And we will save him,” replied the sailor. “We will nurse him as if he\r\nwas one of ourselves.”\r\n\r\nIt appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on Pencroft’s\r\nshoulder as if to thank him. The sailor was wounded himself, but his\r\nwound was insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to\r\ntheir firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants\r\nat a distance. It was therefore only the orang whose condition was\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nJup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and only a\r\nslight moan now and then escaped his lips. He was gently drawn up to\r\nGranite House. There he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the\r\nbeds, and his wounds were bathed with the greatest care. It did not\r\nappear that any vital part had been reached, but Jup was very weak from\r\nloss of blood, and a high fever soon set in after his wounds had been\r\ndressed. He was laid down, strict diet was imposed, “just like a real\r\nperson,” as Neb said, and they made him swallow several cups of\r\na cooling drink, for which the ingredients were supplied from the\r\nvegetable medicine chest of Granite House. Jup was at first restless,\r\nbut his breathing gradually became more regular, and he was left\r\nsleeping quietly. From time to time Top, walking on tip-toe, as one\r\nmight say, came to visit his friend, and seemed to approve of all the\r\ncare that had been taken of him. One of Jup’s hands hung over the side\r\nof his bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air.\r\n\r\nThey employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to the\r\nforest of the Far West, and there buried deep.\r\n\r\nThis attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was a\r\nlesson to the settlers, who from this time never went to bed until one\r\nof their number had made sure that all the bridges were raised, and that\r\nno invasion was possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for several\r\ndays, began to recover. His constitution brought him through, the fever\r\ngradually subsided, and Gideon Spilett, who was a bit of a doctor,\r\npronounced him quite out of danger. On the 16th of August, Jup began to\r\neat. Neb made him nice little sweet dishes, which the invalid devoured\r\nwith great relish, for if he had a pet failing it was that of being\r\nsomewhat of a gourmand, and Neb had never done anything to cure him of\r\nthis fault.\r\n\r\n“What would you have?” said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes\r\nexpostulated with him for spoiling the ape. “Poor Jup has no other\r\npleasure than that of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able to\r\nreward his services in this way!”\r\n\r\nTen days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master Jup\r\narose. His wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would not\r\nbe long in regaining his usual strength and agility. Like all\r\nconvalescents, he was tremendously hungry, and the reporter allowed him\r\nto eat as much as he liked, for he trusted to that instinct, which\r\nis too often wanting in reasoning beings, to keep the orang from any\r\nexcess. Neb was delighted to see his pupil’s appetite returning.\r\n\r\n“Eat away, my Jup,” said he, “and don’t spare anything; you have shed\r\nyour blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you strong\r\nagain!”\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of August Neb’s voice was heard calling to his companions.\r\n\r\n“Captain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!”\r\n\r\nThe colonists, who were together in the dining-room, rose at Neb’s call,\r\nwho was then in Jup’s room.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Look,” replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they see?\r\nMaster Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged like a Turk\r\nat the entrance to Granite House!\r\n\r\n“My pipe,” cried Pencroft. “He has taken my pipe! Hello, my honest Jup,\r\nI make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke away!”\r\n\r\nAnd Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him\r\ngreat satisfaction. Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this\r\nincident, and he cited several examples of tame apes, to whom the use of\r\ntobacco had become quite familiar.\r\n\r\nBut from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor’s\r\nex-pipe, which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco. He filled\r\nit himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be\r\nthe happiest of quadrumana. It may readily be understood that this\r\nsimilarity of tastes of Jup and Pencroft served to tighten the bonds of\r\nfriendship which already existed between the honest ape and the worthy\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he is really a man,” said Pencroft sometimes to Neb. “Should\r\nyou be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some day?”\r\n\r\n“My word, no,” replied Neb. “What astonishes me is that he hasn’t spoken\r\nto us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!”\r\n\r\n“It would amuse me all the same,” resumed the sailor, “if some fine day\r\nhe said to me, ‘Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Neb, “what a pity he was born dumb!”\r\n\r\nWith the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again\r\neagerly commenced. The building of the vessel advanced rapidly, she was\r\nalready completely decked over, and all the inside parts of the hull\r\nwere firmly united with ribs bent by means of steam, which answered all\r\nthe purposes of a mold.\r\n\r\nAs there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer to give\r\na double lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the vessel.\r\n\r\nHarding, not knowing what the future might have in store for them,\r\napproved the sailor’s idea of making the craft as strong as possible.\r\nThe interior and deck of the vessel was entirely finished towards the\r\n15th of September. For calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed,\r\nwhich was hammered in between the planks; then these seams were covered\r\nwith boiling tar, which was obtained in great abundance from the pines\r\nin the forest.\r\n\r\nThe management of the vessel was very simple. She had from the first\r\nbeen ballasted with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a bed of lime,\r\ntwelve thousand pounds of which they stowed away.\r\n\r\nA deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was divided into\r\ntwo cabins; two benches extended along them and served also as lockers.\r\nThe foot of the mast supported the partition which separated the two\r\ncabins, which were reached by two hatchways let into the deck.\r\n\r\nPencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast. He\r\nchose a straight young fir, with no knots, and which he had only to\r\nsquare at the step, and round off at the top. The ironwork of the mast,\r\nthe rudder and the hull had been roughly but strongly forged at the\r\nChimneys. Lastly, yards, masts, boom, spars, oars, etc., were all\r\nfurnished by the first week in October, and it was agreed that a trial\r\ntrip should be taken round the island, so as to ascertain how the vessel\r\nwould behave at sea, and how far they might depend upon her.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the necessary works had not been neglected.\r\nThe corral was enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had been\r\nincreased by a number of young ones, who had to be housed and fed. The\r\ncolonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed, the warren, the coal\r\nand iron mines, and to the till then unexplored districts of the Far\r\nWest forest, which abounded in game. Certain indigenous plants were\r\ndiscovered, and those fit for immediate use contributed to vary the\r\nvegetable stores of Granite House.\r\n\r\nThey were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the Cape, with\r\neatable fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October the vessel was launched. Pencroft was radiant\r\nwith joy, the operation was perfectly successful; the boat completely\r\nrigged, having been pushed on rollers to the water’s edge, was floated\r\nby the rising tide, amid the cheers of the colonists, particularly of\r\nPencroft, who showed no modesty on this occasion. Besides his importance\r\nwas to last beyond the finishing of the vessel, since, after having\r\nbuilt her, he was to command her. The grade of captain was bestowed upon\r\nhim with the approbation of all. To satisfy Captain Pencroft, it was now\r\nnecessary to give a name to the vessel, and, after many propositions had\r\nbeen discussed, the votes were all in favor of the “Bonadventure.” As\r\nsoon as the “Bonadventure” had been lifted by the rising tide, it was\r\nseen that she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated.\r\nHowever, the trial trip was to be made that very day, by an excursion\r\noff the coast. The weather was fine, the breeze fresh, and the sea\r\nsmooth, especially towards the south coast, for the wind was blowing\r\nfrom the northwest.\r\n\r\n“All hands on board,” shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first\r\nnecessary, and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in the\r\nevent of their excursion being prolonged until the evening.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model of which\r\nhad originated with him, although on the sailor’s advice he had altered\r\nsome parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft’s confidence in her,\r\nand as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to Tabor Island,\r\nHarding hoped he had given it up. He would have indeed great reluctance\r\nin letting two or three of his companions venture so far in so small a\r\nboat, which was not of more than fifteen tons’ burden.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and Herbert\r\nweighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the\r\nMercy. The sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag floated from the\r\nmasthead, and the “Bonadventure,” steered by Pencroft, stood out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus showed her\r\nowners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a remarkably fast\r\npair of heels, according to Pencroft’s mode of speaking. After having\r\ndoubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the captain kept her close hauled,\r\nso as to sail along the southern coast of the island, when it was found\r\nshe sailed admirably within five points of the wind. All hands were\r\nenchanted, they had a good vessel, which, in case of need, would be\r\nof great service to them, and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the\r\nvoyage promised to be charming.\r\n\r\nPencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across from Port\r\nBalloon. The island then appeared in all its extent and under a new\r\naspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw Cape to Reptile\r\nEnd, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with the young foliage\r\nof other trees and overlooked the whole, and Mount Franklin whose lofty\r\nhead was still whitened with snow.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful it is!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, our island is beautiful and good,” replied Pencroft. “I love it as\r\nI loved my poor mother. It received us poor and destitute, and now what\r\nis wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied Neb; “nothing, captain.”\r\n\r\nAnd the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of their\r\nisland!\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast, sketched\r\nthe panorama which was developed before his eyes.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.\r\n\r\n“Well, Captain Harding,” asked Pencroft, “what do you think of our\r\nvessel?”\r\n\r\n“She appears to behave well,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Good! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some\r\nextent?”\r\n\r\n“What voyage, Pencroft?”\r\n\r\n“One to Tabor Island, for instance.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” replied Harding, “I think that in any pressing emergency\r\nwe need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the ‘Bonadventure’ even for\r\na longer voyage; but you know I should see you set off to Tabor Island\r\nwith great uneasiness, since nothing obliges you to go there.”\r\n\r\n“One likes to know one’s neighbors,” returned the sailor, who was\r\nobstinate in his idea. “Tabor Island is our neighbor, and the only one!\r\nPoliteness requires us to go at least to pay a visit.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove,” said Spilett, “our friend Pencroft has become very particular\r\nabout the proprieties all at once!”\r\n\r\n“I am not particular about anything at all,” retorted the sailor, who\r\nwas rather vexed by the engineer’s opposition, but who did not wish to\r\ncause him anxiety.\r\n\r\n“Consider, Pencroft,” resumed Harding, “you cannot go alone to Tabor\r\nIsland.”\r\n\r\n“One companion will be enough for me.”\r\n\r\n“Even so,” replied the engineer, “you will risk depriving the colony of\r\nLincoln Island of two settlers out of five.”\r\n\r\n“Out of six,” answered Pencroft; “you forget Jup.”\r\n\r\n“Out of seven,” added Neb; “Top is quite worth another.”\r\n\r\n“There is no risk at all in it, captain,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“That is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose ourselves\r\nuselessly.”\r\n\r\nThe obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation drop, quite\r\ndetermined to resume it again. But he did not suspect that an incident\r\nwould come to his aid and change into an act of humanity that which was\r\nat first only a doubtful whim.\r\n\r\nAfter standing off the shore the “Bonadventure” again approached it\r\nin the direction of Port Balloon. It was important to ascertain the\r\nchannels between the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be laid down\r\nsince this little creek was to be the harbor.\r\n\r\nThey were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was necessary\r\nto tack to beat against the wind. The “Bonadventure” was then going at a\r\nvery moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land,\r\nscarcely swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only\r\nrippled now and then by passing gusts.\r\n\r\nHerbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate the\r\ncourse to be followed among the channels, when all at once he shouted,--\r\n\r\n“Luff, Pencroft, luff!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter,” replied the sailor; “a rock?”\r\n\r\n“No--wait,” said Herbert; “I don’t quite see. Luff again--right--now.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into the\r\nwater, and pulled it out, exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n“A bottle!”\r\n\r\nHe held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a few\r\ncables’ length from the shore.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding took the bottle. Without uttering a single word he drew\r\nthe cork, and took from it a damp paper, on which were written these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n“Castaway.... Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11’ S. lat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\n“A castaway!” exclaimed Pencroft; “left on this Tabor Island not two\r\nhundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won’t now oppose my\r\ngoing.”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding; “and you shall set out as soon as\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from\r\nthe bottle. He contemplated it for some instants, then resumed,\r\n\r\n“From this document, my friends, from the way in which it is worded,\r\nwe may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor Island is a man\r\npossessing a considerable knowledge of navigation, since he gives the\r\nlatitude and longitude of the island exactly as we ourselves found it,\r\nand to a second of approximation; secondly, that he is either English or\r\nAmerican, as the document is written in the English language.”\r\n\r\n“That is perfectly logical,” answered Spilett; “and the presence of this\r\ncastaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of our island.\r\nThere must have been a wreck, since there is a castaway. As to the\r\nlatter, whoever he may be, it is lucky for him that Pencroft thought of\r\nbuilding this boat and of trying her this very day, for a day later and\r\nthis bottle might have been broken on the rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Herbert, “it is a fortunate chance that the\r\n‘Bonadventure’ passed exactly where the bottle was still floating!”\r\n\r\n“Does not this appear strange to you?” asked Harding of Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“It appears fortunate, that’s all,” answered the sailor. “Do you see\r\nanything extraordinary in it, captain? The bottle must go somewhere, and\r\nwhy not here as well as anywhere else?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right, Pencroft,” replied the engineer; “and yet--”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Herbert, “there’s nothing to prove that this bottle has\r\nbeen floating long in the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and the document appears even to\r\nhave been recently written. What do you think about it, Cyrus?”\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive. He had put\r\nthe vessel about, and the “Bonadventure,” all sails set, was running\r\nrapidly towards Claw Cape.\r\n\r\nEvery one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island. Should they\r\nbe in time to save him? This was a great event in the life of the\r\ncolonists! They themselves were but castaways, but it was to be feared\r\nthat another might not have been so fortunate, and their duty was to go\r\nto his succor.\r\n\r\nClaw Cape was doubled, and about four o’clock the “Bonadventure” dropped\r\nher anchor at the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nThat same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were made.\r\nIt appeared best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to work the\r\nvessel, should undertake the voyage alone. By setting out the next day,\r\nthe 10th of October, they would arrive on the 13th, for with the present\r\nwind it would not take more than forty-eight hours to make this passage\r\nof a hundred and fifty miles. One day in the island, three or four to\r\nreturn, they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again\r\nreach Lincoln Island. The weather was fine, the barometer was rising,\r\nthe wind appeared settled, everything then was in favor of these brave\r\nmen whom an act of humanity was taking far from their island.\r\n\r\nThus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon Spilett\r\nshould remain at Granite House, but an objection was raised, and\r\nSpilett, who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the New York\r\nHerald, having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose\r\nsuch an opportunity, he was admitted to take a part in the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe evening was occupied in transporting on board the “Bonadventure,”\r\n articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a compass, provisions\r\nfor a week; this being rapidly done, the colonists ascended to Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at five o’clock in the morning, the farewells were said,\r\nnot without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting sail made\r\ntowards Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to proceed to the\r\nsouthwest.\r\n\r\nThe “Bonadventure” was already a quarter of a mile from the coast when\r\nthe passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House two men waving\r\ntheir farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and Neb.\r\n\r\n“Our friends,” exclaimed Spilett, “this is our first separation in\r\nfifteen months.”\r\n\r\nPencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite House\r\nsoon disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the day the “Bonadventure” was still in sight\r\nof the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared just like\r\na green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the center. The heights,\r\ndiminished by distance, did not present an appearance likely to tempt\r\nvessels to touch there. Reptile End was passed in about an hour, though\r\nat a distance of about ten miles.\r\n\r\nAt this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish anything of\r\nthe Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges of Mount Franklin,\r\nand three hours after the last of Lincoln Island sank below the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe “Bonadventure” behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves she\r\nproceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the foresail, and\r\nsteering by the compass followed a rectilinear direction. From time to\r\ntime Herbert relieved him at the helm, and the lad’s hand was so firm\r\nthat the sailor had not a point to find fault with.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the other, if\r\nwanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain Pencroft was perfectly\r\nsatisfied with his crew.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its first\r\nquarter until the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set again. The\r\nnight was dark but starry, and the next day again promised to be fine.\r\n\r\nPencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be caught by\r\na sudden gust while carrying too much canvas; it was perhaps an\r\nunnecessary precaution on such a calm night, but Pencroft was a prudent\r\nsailor and cannot be blamed for it.\r\n\r\nThe reporter slept part of the night. Pencroft and Herbert took turns\r\nfor a spell of two hours each at the helm. The sailor trusted Herbert as\r\nhe would himself, and his confidence was justified by the coolness and\r\njudgment of the lad. Pencroft gave him his directions as a commander to\r\nhis steersman, and Herbert never allowed the “Bonadventure” to swerve\r\neven a point. The night passed quickly, as did the day of the 12th of\r\nOctober. A south-easterly direction was strictly maintained. Unless the\r\n“Bonadventure” fell in with some unknown current she would come exactly\r\nwithin sight of Tabor Island.\r\n\r\nAs to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was absolutely\r\ndeserted. Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird passed within\r\ngunshot, and Gideon Spilett wondered if it was to one of them that he\r\nhad confided his last letter addressed to the New York Herald. These\r\nbirds were the only beings that appeared to frequent this part of the\r\nocean between Tabor and Lincoln Islands.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” observed Herbert, “this is the time that whalers usually\r\nproceed towards the southern part of the Pacific. Indeed I do not think\r\nthere could be a more deserted sea than this.”\r\n\r\n“It is not quite so deserted as all that,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“We are on it. Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?”\r\n\r\nAnd Pencroft laughed at his joke.\r\n\r\nBy the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that the\r\n“Bonadventure” had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles\r\nsince her departure from Lincoln Island, that is to say in thirty-six\r\nhours, which would give her a speed of between three and four knots.\r\nThe breeze was very slight and might soon drop altogether.\r\nHowever, it was hoped that the next morning by break of day, if the\r\ncalculation had been correct and the course true, they would sight Tabor\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nNeither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night. In the\r\nexpectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion.\r\nThere was so much uncertainty in their enterprise! Were they near Tabor\r\nIsland? Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor\r\nthey had come? Who was this man? Would not his presence disturb the\r\nlittle colony till then so united? Besides, would he be content to\r\nexchange his prison for another? All these questions, which would no\r\ndoubt be answered the next day, kept them in suspense, and at the dawn\r\nof day they all fixed their gaze on the western horizon.\r\n\r\n“Land!” shouted Pencroft at about six o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nAnd it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was\r\nevident that land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of\r\nthe “Bonadventure.” In a few hours they would land on the beach of the\r\nisland!\r\n\r\nThe low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea, was not\r\nmore than fifteen miles distant.\r\n\r\nThe head of the “Bonadventure,” which was a little to the south of the\r\nisland, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted in the east,\r\nits rays fell upon one or two headlands.\r\n\r\n“This is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,” observed\r\nHerbert, “and is probably due like ours to some submarine convulsion.”\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock the “Bonadventure” was not more than two miles off,\r\nand Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to land,\r\nproceeded very cautiously through the unknown waters. The whole of the\r\nisland could now be surveyed, and on it could be seen groups of gum\r\nand other large trees, of the same species as those growing on Lincoln\r\nIsland. But the astonishing thing was that no smoke arose to show that\r\nthe island was inhabited, no signal whatever appeared on the shore!\r\n\r\nAnd yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and this\r\ncastaway should have been on the watch.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the “Bonadventure” entered the winding channels among\r\nthe reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme care. He had\r\nput Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows, inspecting the\r\nwater, while he held the halliard in his hand, ready to lower the sail\r\nat a moment’s notice. Gideon Spilett with his glass eagerly scanned the\r\nshore, though without perceiving anything.\r\n\r\nHowever, at about twelve o’clock the keel of the “Bonadventure” grated\r\non the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew of\r\nthe little vessel landed.\r\n\r\nAnd there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island, since\r\naccording to the most recent charts there was no island in this part of\r\nthe Pacific between New Zealand and the American Coast.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no danger of\r\nher being carried away by the receding tide; then Pencroft and his\r\ncompanions, well armed, ascended the shore, so as to gain an elevation\r\nof about two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet which rose at a\r\ndistance of half a mile.\r\n\r\n“From the summit of that hill,” said Spilett, “we can no doubt obtain a\r\ncomplete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate our search.”\r\n\r\n“So as to do here,” replied Herbert, “that which Captain Harding did the\r\nvery first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount Franklin.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so,” answered the reporter, “and it is the best plan.”\r\n\r\nWhile thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing\r\nwhich terminated at the foot of the hill. Flocks of rock-pigeons and\r\nsea-swallows, similar to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered around them.\r\nUnder the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the\r\nbushes rustling and see the grass waving, which indicated the presence\r\nof timid animals, but still nothing to show that the island was\r\ninhabited.\r\n\r\nArrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed\r\nit in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon.\r\n\r\nThey were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles in\r\ncircumference, its shape not much bordered by capes or promontories,\r\nbays or creeks, being a lengthened oval. All around, the lonely sea\r\nextended to the limits of the horizon. No land nor even a sail was in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThis woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island,\r\narid and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other. On the\r\ncontrary this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or\r\nthree hills of no great height. Obliquely to the oval of the island ran\r\na stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a\r\nnarrow mouth.\r\n\r\n“The domain is limited,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” rejoined Pencroft: “It would have been too small for us.”\r\n\r\n“And moreover,” said the reporter, “it appears to be uninhabited.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” answered Herbert, “nothing here betrays the presence of man.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go down,” said Pencroft, “and search.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the place\r\nwhere they had left the “Bonadventure.”\r\n\r\nThey had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before\r\nexploring the interior; so that not a spot should escape their\r\ninvestigations. The beach was easy to follow, and only in some places\r\nwas their way barred by large rocks, which, however, they easily passed\r\nround. The explorers proceeded towards the south, disturbing numerous\r\nflocks of sea-birds and herds of seals, which threw themselves into the\r\nsea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance.\r\n\r\n“Those beasts yonder,” observed the reporter, “do not see men for the\r\nfirst time. They fear them, therefore they must know them.”\r\n\r\nAn hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the\r\nislet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the north along\r\nthe western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks, the background\r\nbordered with thick woods.\r\n\r\nThere was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print of a\r\nhuman foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours’ walking\r\nhad been gone completely round.\r\n\r\nIt was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were compelled to\r\nbelieve that Tabor Island was not or was no longer inhabited. Perhaps,\r\nafter all the document was already several months or several years old,\r\nand it was possible in this case, either that the castaway had been\r\nenabled to return to his country, or that he had died of misery.\r\n\r\nPencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable\r\nconjectures, dined rapidly on board the “Bonadventure” so as to be\r\nable to continue their excursion until nightfall. This was done at five\r\no’clock in the evening, at which hour they entered the wood.\r\n\r\nNumerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one might\r\nsay, only goats and pigs, which were obviously European species.\r\n\r\nDoubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they had\r\nrapidly increased. Herbert resolved to catch one or two living, and take\r\nthem back to Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited\r\nthis islet, and this became still more evident when paths appeared\r\ntrodden through the forest, felled trees, and everywhere traces of the\r\nhand of man; but the trees were becoming rotten, and had been felled\r\nmany years ago; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss, and the\r\ngrass grew long and thick on the paths, so that it was difficult to find\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Gideon Spilett, “this not only proves that men have\r\nlanded on the island, but also that they lived on it for some time. Now,\r\nwho were these men? How many of them remain?”\r\n\r\n“The document,” said Herbert, “only spoke of one castaway.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if he is still on the island,” replied Pencroft, “it is\r\nimpossible but that we shall find him.”\r\n\r\nThe exploration was continued. The sailor and his companions naturally\r\nfollowed the route which cut diagonally across the island, and they were\r\nthus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea.\r\n\r\nIf the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand, showed\r\nincontestably that men had already visited the island, several specimens\r\nof the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less. In some places, in the\r\nmidst of clearings, it was evident that the soil had been planted with\r\nculinary plants, at probably the same distant period.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was Herbert’s joy, when he recognized potatoes, chicory,\r\nsorrel, carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was sufficient to\r\ncollect the seed to enrich the soil of Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n“Capital, jolly!” exclaimed Pencroft. “That will suit Neb as well as us.\r\nEven if we do not find the castaway, at least our voyage will not have\r\nbeen useless, and God will have rewarded us.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but to see the state in which we\r\nfind these plantations, it is to be feared that the island has not been\r\ninhabited for some time.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” answered Herbert, “an inhabitant, whoever he was, could not\r\nhave neglected such an important culture!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Pencroft, “the castaway has gone.”\r\n\r\n“We must suppose so.”\r\n\r\n“It must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date?”\r\n\r\n“Evidently.”\r\n\r\n“And that the bottle only arrived at Lincoln Island after having floated\r\nin the sea a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” returned Pencroft. “But night is coming on,” added he, “and I\r\nthink that it will be best to give up the search for the present.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go on board, and to-morrow we will begin again,” said the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\nThis was the wisest course, and it was about to be followed when\r\nHerbert, pointing to a confused mass among the trees, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“A hut!”\r\n\r\nAll three immediately ran towards the dwelling. In the twilight it was\r\njust possible to see that it was built of planks and covered with a\r\nthick tarpaulin.\r\n\r\nThe half-closed door was pushed open by Pencroft, who entered with a\r\nrapid step.\r\n\r\nThe hut was empty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nPencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett remained silent in the midst of\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\nPencroft shouted loudly.\r\n\r\nNo reply was made.\r\n\r\nThe sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig. This lighted for\r\na minute a small room, which appeared perfectly empty. At the back was\r\na rude fireplace, with a few cold cinders, supporting an armful of dry\r\nwood. Pencroft threw the blazing twig on it, the wood crackled and gave\r\nforth a bright light.\r\n\r\nThe sailor and his two companions then perceived a disordered bed, of\r\nwhich the damp and yellow coverlets proved that it had not been used for\r\na long time. In the corner of the fireplace were two kettles, covered\r\nwith rust, and an overthrown pot. A cupboard, with a few moldy sailor’s\r\nclothes; on the table a tin plate and a Bible, eaten away by damp; in a\r\ncorner a few tools, a spade, pickaxe, two fowling-pieces, one of which\r\nwas broken; on a plank, forming a shelf, stood a barrel of powder, still\r\nuntouched, a barrel of shot, and several boxes of caps, all thickly\r\ncovered with dust, accumulated, perhaps, by many long years.\r\n\r\n“There is no one here,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“No one,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“It is a long time since this room has been inhabited,” observed\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a very long time!” answered the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Spilett,” then said Pencroft, “instead of returning on board, I\r\nthink that it would be well to pass the night in this hut.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Pencroft,” answered Gideon Spilett, “and if its owner\r\nreturns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place taken\r\npossession of.”\r\n\r\n“He will not return,” said the sailor, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“You think that he has quitted the island?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and\r\nhis tools,” replied Pencroft. “You know the value which castaways set\r\non such articles as these the last remains of a wreck. No! no!” repeated\r\nthe sailor, in a tone of conviction; “no, he has not left the island! If\r\nhe had escaped in a boat made by himself, he would still less have left\r\nthese indispensable and necessary articles. No! he is on the island!”\r\n\r\n“Living?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Living or dead. But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried himself,\r\nand so we shall at least find his remains!”\r\n\r\nIt was then agreed that the night should be passed in the deserted\r\ndwelling, and a store of wood found in a corner was sufficient to warm\r\nit. The door closed, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett remained there,\r\nseated on a bench, talking little but wondering much. They were in a\r\nframe of mind to imagine anything or expect anything. They listened\r\neagerly for sounds outside. The door might have opened suddenly, and\r\na man presented himself to them without their being in the least\r\nsurprised, notwithstanding all that the hut revealed of abandonment,\r\nand they had their hands ready to press the hands of this man, this\r\ncastaway, this unknown friend, for whom friends were waiting.\r\n\r\nBut no voice was heard, the door did not open. The hours thus passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHow long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions! Herbert\r\nalone slept for two hours, for at his age sleep is a necessity. They\r\nwere all three anxious to continue their exploration of the day before,\r\nand to search the most secret recesses of the islet! The inferences\r\ndeduced by Pencroft were perfectly reasonable, and it was nearly certain\r\nthat, as the hut was deserted, and the tools, utensils, and weapons were\r\nstill there, the owner had succumbed. It was agreed, therefore, that\r\nthey should search for his remains, and give them at least Christian\r\nburial.\r\n\r\nDay dawned; Pencroft and his companions immediately proceeded to survey\r\nthe dwelling. It had certainly been built in a favorable situation,\r\nat the back of a little hill, sheltered by five or six magnificent\r\ngum-trees. Before its front and through the trees the axe had prepared\r\na wide clearing, which allowed the view to extend to the sea. Beyond a\r\nlawn, surrounded by a wooden fence falling to pieces, was the shore, on\r\nthe left of which was the mouth of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe hut had been built of planks, and it was easy to see that these\r\nplanks had been obtained from the hull or deck of a ship. It was\r\nprobable that a disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of the\r\nisland, that one at least of the crew had been saved, and that by means\r\nof the wreck this man, having tools at his disposal, had built the\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nAnd this became still more evident when Gideon Spilett, after having\r\nwalked around the hut, saw on a plank, probably one of those which\r\nhad formed the armor of the wrecked vessel, these letters already half\r\neffaced:\r\n\r\n\r\n              BR--TAN--A\r\n\r\n\r\n“Britannia,” exclaimed Pencroft, whom the reporter had called; “it is\r\na common name for ships, and I could not say if she was English or\r\nAmerican!”\r\n\r\n“It matters very little, Pencroft!”\r\n\r\n“Very little indeed,” answered the sailor, “and we will save the\r\nsurvivor of her crew if he is still living, to whatever country he may\r\nbelong. But before beginning our search again let us go on board the\r\n‘Bonadventure’.”\r\n\r\nA sort of uneasiness had seized Pencroft upon the subject of his vessel.\r\nShould the island be inhabited after all, and should some one have taken\r\npossession of her? But he shrugged his shoulders at such an unreasonable\r\nsupposition. At any rate the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on\r\nboard. The road already trodden was not long, scarcely a mile. They set\r\nout on their walk, gazing into the wood and thickets through which goats\r\nand pigs fled in hundreds.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions reached\r\nthe western coast of the island, and saw the “Bonadventure” held fast by\r\nher anchor, which was buried deep in the sand.\r\n\r\nPencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction. After all this\r\nvessel was his child, and it is the right of fathers to be often uneasy\r\nwhen there is no occasion for it.\r\n\r\nThey returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be necessary\r\nto dine until very late; then the repast being ended, the exploration\r\nwas continued and conducted with the most minute care. Indeed, it was\r\nvery probable that the only inhabitant of the island had perished. It\r\nwas therefore more for the traces of a dead than of a living man that\r\nPencroft and his companions searched. But their searches were vain, and\r\nduring the half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets\r\nof trees which covered the islet. There was then scarcely any doubt\r\nthat, if the castaway was dead, no trace of his body now remained, but\r\nthat some wild beast had probably devoured it to the last bone.\r\n\r\n“We will set off to-morrow at daybreak,” said Pencroft to his two\r\ncompanions, as about two o’clock they were resting for a few minutes\r\nunder the shade of a clump of firs.\r\n\r\n“I should think that we might without scruple take the utensils which\r\nbelonged to the castaway,” added Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I think so, too,” returned Gideon Spilett, “and these arms and tools\r\nwill make up the stores of Granite House. The supply of powder and shot\r\nis also most important.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “but we must not forget to capture a couple or\r\ntwo of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is destitute.”\r\n\r\n“Nor to gather those seeds,” added Herbert, “which will give us all the\r\nvegetables of the Old and the New Worlds.”\r\n\r\n“Then perhaps it would be best,” said the reporter, “to remain a day\r\nlonger on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful to us.”\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Spilett,” answered Pencroft, “I will ask you to set off\r\nto-morrow at daybreak. The wind seems to me to be likely to shift to the\r\nwest, and after having had a fair wind for coming we shall have a fair\r\nwind for going back.”\r\n\r\n“Then do not let us lose time,” said Herbert, rising.\r\n\r\n“We won’t waste time,” returned Pencroft. “You, Herbert, go and gather\r\nthe seeds, which you know better than we do. While you do that, Mr.\r\nSpilett and I will go and have a pig hunt, and even without Top I hope\r\nwe shall manage to catch a few!”\r\n\r\nHerbert accordingly took the path which led towards the cultivated part\r\nof the islet, while the sailor and the reporter entered the forest.\r\n\r\nMany specimens of the porcine race fled before them, and these animals,\r\nwhich were singularly active, did not appear to be in a humor to allow\r\nthemselves to be approached.\r\n\r\nHowever, after an hour’s chase, the hunters had just managed to get hold\r\nof a couple lying in a thicket, when cries were heard resounding from\r\nthe north part of the island, With the cries were mingled terrible\r\nyells, in which there was nothing human.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Gideon Spilett were at once on their feet, and the pigs\r\nby this movement began to run away, at the moment when the sailor was\r\ngetting ready the rope to bind them.\r\n\r\n“That’s Herbert’s voice,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Run!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the\r\nspot from whence the cries proceeded.\r\n\r\nThey did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a clearing they\r\nsaw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being,\r\napparently a gigantic ape, who was about to do him some great harm.\r\n\r\nTo rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn, snatch\r\nHerbert from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a minute for\r\nPencroft and Gideon Spilett. The sailor was of Herculean strength, the\r\nreporter also very powerful, and in spite of the monster’s resistance he\r\nwas firmly tied so that he could not even move.\r\n\r\n“You are not hurt, Herbert?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No, no!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if this ape had wounded him!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“But he is not an ape,” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\nAt these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the singular being\r\nwho lay on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it was a human being,\r\na man. But what a man! A savage in all the horrible acceptation of the\r\nword, and so much the more frightful that he seemed fallen to the lowest\r\ndegree of brutishness!\r\n\r\nShaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body almost\r\nnaked except a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous hands with\r\nimmensely long nails, skin the color of mahogany, feet as hard as if\r\nmade of horn, such was the miserable creature who yet had a claim to be\r\ncalled a man. But it might justly be asked if there were yet a soul in\r\nthis body, or if the brute instinct alone survived in it!\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?”\r\n said Pencroft to the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Alas! there is no doubt about it,” replied Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Then this must be the castaway?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but the unfortunate man has no longer\r\nanything human about him!”\r\n\r\nThe reporter spoke the truth. It was evident that if the castaway had\r\never been a civilized being, solitude had made him a savage, or worse,\r\nperhaps a regular man of the woods. Hoarse sounds issued from his throat\r\nbetween his teeth, which were sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to\r\ntear raw flesh.\r\n\r\nMemory must have deserted him long before, and for a long time also he\r\nhad forgotten how to use his gun and tools, and he no longer knew how to\r\nmake a fire! It could be seen that he was active and powerful, but the\r\nphysical qualities had been developed in him to the injury of the moral\r\nqualities. Gideon Spilett spoke to him. He did not appear to understand\r\nor even to hear. And yet on looking into his eyes, the reporter thought\r\nhe could see that all reason was not extinguished in him. However, the\r\nprisoner did not struggle, nor even attempt to break his bonds. Was he\r\noverwhelmed by the presence of men whose fellow he had once been? Had he\r\nfound in some corner of his brain a fleeting remembrance which recalled\r\nhim to humanity? If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?\r\nThey could not tell, but they did not make the experiment; and after\r\ngazing attentively at the miserable creature,--\r\n\r\n“Whoever he may be,” remarked Gideon Spilett, “whoever he may have\r\nbeen, and whatever he may become, it is our duty to take him with us to\r\nLincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes!” replied Herbert, “and perhaps with care we may arouse in him\r\nsome gleam of intelligence.”\r\n\r\n“The soul does not die,” said the reporter, “and it would be a great\r\nsatisfaction to rescue one of God’s creatures from brutishness.”\r\n\r\nPencroft shook his head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“We must try at any rate,” returned the reporter; “humanity commands\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nIt was indeed their duty as Christians and civilized beings. All three\r\nfelt this, and they well knew that Cyrus Harding would approve of their\r\nacting thus.\r\n\r\n“Shall we leave him bound?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Let us try,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\nThe cords which shackled the prisoner’s feet were cut off, but his arms\r\nremained securely fastened. He got up by himself and did not manifest\r\nany desire to run away. His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the\r\nthree men, who walked near him, but nothing denoted that he recollected\r\nbeing their fellow, or at least having been so. A continual hissing\r\nsound issued from his lips, his aspect was wild, but he did not attempt\r\nto resist.\r\n\r\nBy the reporter’s advice the unfortunate man was taken to the hut.\r\nPerhaps the sight of the things that belonged to him would make some\r\nimpression on him! Perhaps a spark would be sufficient to revive his\r\nobscured intellect, to rekindle his dulled soul. The dwelling was\r\nnot far off. In a few minutes they arrived there, but the prisoner\r\nremembered nothing, and it appeared that he had lost consciousness of\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nWhat could they think of the degree of brutishness into which this\r\nmiserable being had fallen, unless that his imprisonment on the islet\r\ndated from a very distant period and after having arrived there a\r\nrational being solitude had reduced him to this condition.\r\n\r\nThe reporter then thought that perhaps the sight of fire would have\r\nsome effect on him, and in a moment one of those beautiful flames, that\r\nattract even animals, blazed up on the hearth. The sight of the flame\r\nseemed at first to fix the attention of the unhappy object, but soon\r\nhe turned away and the look of intelligence faded. Evidently there was\r\nnothing to be done, for the time at least, but to take him on board\r\nthe “Bonadventure.” This was done, and he remained there in Pencroft’s\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nHerbert and Spilett returned to finish their work; and some hours after\r\nthey came back to the shore, carrying the utensils and guns, a store of\r\nvegetables, of seeds, some game, and two couple of pigs.\r\n\r\nAll was embarked, and the “Bonadventure” was ready to weigh anchor and\r\nsail with the morning tide.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner had been placed in the fore-cabin, where he remained quiet,\r\nsilent, apparently deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nPencroft offered him something to eat, but he pushed away the cooked\r\nmeat that was presented to him and which doubtless did not suit him. But\r\non the sailor showing him one of the ducks which Herbert had killed, he\r\npounced on it like a wild beast, and devoured it greedily.\r\n\r\n“You think that he will recover his senses?” asked Pencroft. “It is\r\nnot impossible that our care will have an effect upon him, for it is\r\nsolitude that has made him what he is, and from this time forward he\r\nwill be no longer alone.”\r\n\r\n“The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time,”\r\n said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” answered Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“About what age is he?” asked the lad.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to say,” replied the reporter, “for it is impossible to\r\nsee his features under the thick beard which covers his face, but he is\r\nno longer young, and I suppose he might be about fifty.”\r\n\r\n“Have you noticed, Mr. Spilett, how deeply sunk his eyes are?” asked\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Herbert, but I must add that they are more human than one could\r\nexpect from his appearance.”\r\n\r\n“However, we shall see,” replied Pencroft, “and I am anxious to know\r\nwhat opinion Captain Harding will have of our savage. We went to look\r\nfor a human creature, and we are bringing back a monster! After all, we\r\ndid what we could.”\r\n\r\nThe night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could not be\r\nknown, but at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did not\r\nmove. He was like a wild animal, which appears stunned at first by its\r\ncapture, and becomes wild again afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the next morning, the 15th of October, the change of weather\r\npredicted by Pencroft occurred. The wind having shifted to the northwest\r\nfavored the return of the “Bonadventure,” but at the same time it\r\nfreshened, which might render navigation more difficult.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock in the morning the anchor was weighed. Pencroft took a\r\nreef in the mainsail, and steered towards the north-east, so as to sail\r\nstraight for Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident. The prisoner\r\nremained quiet in the fore-cabin, and as he had been a sailor it\r\nappeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary\r\nreaction. Did some recollection of his former calling return to him?\r\nHowever that might be, he remained tranquil, astonished rather than\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\nThe next day the wind increased, blowing more from the north,\r\nconsequently in a less favorable direction for the “Bonadventure.”\r\n Pencroft was soon obliged to sail close-hauled, and without saying\r\nanything about it he began to be uneasy at the state of the sea, which\r\nfrequently broke over the bows. Certainly, if the wind did not moderate,\r\nit would take a longer time to reach Lincoln Island than it had taken to\r\nmake Tabor Island.\r\n\r\nIndeed, on the morning of the 17th, the “Bonadventure” had been\r\nforty-eight hours at sea, and nothing showed that she was near the\r\nisland. It was impossible, besides, to estimate the distance traversed,\r\nor to trust to the reckoning for the direction, as the speed had been\r\nvery irregular.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours after there was yet no land in sight. The wind was\r\nright ahead and the sea very heavy. The sails were close-reefed, and\r\nthey tacked frequently. On the 18th, a wave swept completely over the\r\n“Bonadventure”; and if the crew had not taken the precaution of lashing\r\nthemselves to the deck, they would have been carried away.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Pencroft and his companions, who were occupied with\r\nloosing themselves, received unexpected aid from the prisoner, who\r\nemerged from the hatchway as if his sailor’s instinct had suddenly\r\nreturned, broke a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so as to let\r\nthe water which filled the deck escape. Then the vessel being clear, he\r\ndescended to his cabin without having uttered a word. Pencroft, Gideon\r\nSpilett, and Herbert, greatly astonished, let him proceed.\r\n\r\nTheir situation was truly serious, and the sailor had reason to fear\r\nthat he was lost on the wide sea without any possibility of recovering\r\nhis course.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark and cold. However, about eleven o’clock, the wind\r\nfell, the sea went down, and the speed of the vessel, as she labored\r\nless, greatly increased.\r\n\r\nNeither Pencroft, Spilett, nor Herbert thought of taking an hour’s\r\nsleep. They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island could not\r\nbe far distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the “Bonadventure,”\r\n carried away by currents, had drifted so much that it would be\r\nimpossible to rectify her course. Pencroft, uneasy to the last degree,\r\nyet did not despair, for he had a gallant heart, and grasping the tiller\r\nhe anxiously endeavored to pierce the darkness which surrounded them.\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock in the morning he started forward,--\r\n\r\n“A light! a light!” he shouted.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the northeast. Lincoln\r\nIsland was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus Harding,\r\nshowed them the course to be followed. Pencroft, who was bearing too\r\nmuch to the north, altered his course and steered towards the fire,\r\nwhich burned brightly above the horizon like a star of the first\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 20th of October, at seven o’clock in the morning,\r\nafter a voyage of four days, the “Bonadventure” gently glided up to the\r\nbeach at the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad weather and\r\nthe prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed at daybreak to\r\nthe plateau of Prospect Heights, and they had at last caught sight of\r\nthe vessel which had been so long in returning.\r\n\r\n“God be praised! there they are!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nAs to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round, clapping his\r\nhands and shouting, “Oh! my master!” A more touching pantomime than the\r\nfinest discourse.\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s first idea, on counting the people on the deck of the\r\n“Bonadventure,” was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of Tabor\r\nIsland, or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused to leave his\r\nisland and change one prison for another.\r\n\r\nIndeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the deck of\r\nthe “Bonadventure.”\r\n\r\nThe moment the vessel touched, the engineer and Neb were waiting on\r\nthe beach, and before the passengers had time to leap on to the sand,\r\nHarding said: “We have been very uneasy at your delay, my friends! Did\r\nyou meet with any accident?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Gideon Spilett; “on the contrary, everything went\r\nwonderfully well. We will tell you all about it.”\r\n\r\n“However,” returned the engineer, “your search has been unsuccessful,\r\nsince you are only three, just as you went!”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, captain,” replied the sailor, “we are four.”\r\n\r\n“You have found the castaway?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you have brought him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Living?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where is he? Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“He is,” replied the reporter, “or rather he was a man! There, Cyrus,\r\nthat is all we can tell you!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage,\r\nand under what conditions the search had been conducted; how the only\r\ndwelling in the island had long been abandoned; how at last a castaway\r\nhad been captured, who appeared no longer to belong to the human\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n“And that’s just the point,” added Pencroft, “I don’t know if we have\r\ndone right to bring him here.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly you have, Pencroft,” replied the engineer quickly.\r\n\r\n“But the wretched creature has no sense!”\r\n\r\n“That is possible at present,” replied Cyrus Harding, “but only a few\r\nmonths ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me. And who\r\nknows what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on\r\nthis island? It is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it\r\nmust be believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason, since you\r\nhave found this poor creature in such a state!”\r\n\r\n“But, captain,” asked Herbert, “what leads you to think that the\r\nbrutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months back?”\r\n\r\n“Because the document we found had been recently written,” answered the\r\nengineer, “and the castaway alone can have written it.”\r\n\r\n“Always supposing,” observed Gideon Spilett, “that it had not been\r\nwritten by a companion of this man, since dead.”\r\n\r\n“That is impossible, my dear Spilett.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Because the document would then have spoken of two castaways,” replied\r\nHarding, “and it mentioned only one.”\r\n\r\nHerbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage, and\r\ndwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner’s\r\nmind, when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n“Well, Herbert,” replied the engineer, “you are right to attach great\r\nimportance to this fact. The unfortunate man cannot be incurable, and\r\ndespair has made him what he is; but here he will find his fellow-men,\r\nand since there is still a soul in him, this soul we shall save!”\r\n\r\nThe castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer and\r\nthe great astonishment of Neb, was then brought from the cabin which he\r\noccupied in the fore part of the “Bonadventure”; when once on land he\r\nmanifested a wish to run away.\r\n\r\nBut Cyrus Harding approaching, placed his hand on his shoulder with a\r\ngesture full of authority, and looked at him with infinite tenderness.\r\nImmediately the unhappy man, submitting to a superior will, gradually\r\nbecame calm, his eyes fell, his head bent, and he made no more\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” murmured the engineer.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding had attentively observed him. To judge by his appearance\r\nthis miserable being had no longer anything human about him, and\r\nyet Harding, as had the reporter already, observed in his look an\r\nindefinable trace of intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger as he was\r\nthenceforth termed by his companions, should live in one of the rooms\r\nof Granite House, from which, however, he could not escape. He was led\r\nthere without difficulty, and with careful attention, it might, perhaps,\r\nbe hoped that some day he would be a companion to the settlers in\r\nLincoln Island.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, during breakfast, which Neb had hastened to prepare,\r\nas the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft were dying of hunger, heard in\r\ndetail all the incidents which had marked the voyage of exploration to\r\nthe islet. He agreed with his friends on this point, that the stranger\r\nmust be either English or American, the name Britannia leading them\r\nto suppose this, and, besides, through the bushy beard, and under\r\nthe shaggy, matted hair, the engineer thought he could recognize the\r\ncharacteristic features of the Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\n“But, by the bye,” said Gideon Spilett, addressing Herbert, “you never\r\ntold us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that you\r\nwould have been strangled, if we had not happened to come up in time to\r\nhelp you!”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” answered Herbert, “it is rather difficult to say how it\r\nhappened. I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants, when I heard\r\na noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree. I scarcely\r\nhad time to look round. This unfortunate man, who was without doubt\r\nconcealed in a tree, rushed upon me in less time than I take to tell you\r\nabout it, and unless Mr. Spilett and Pencroft--”\r\n\r\n“My boy!” said Cyrus Harding, “you ran a great danger, but, perhaps,\r\nwithout that, the poor creature would have still hidden himself from\r\nyour search, and we should not have had a new companion.”\r\n\r\n“You hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?” asked the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House and\r\nreturned to the beach. They there occupied themselves in unloading the\r\n“Bonadventure,” and the engineer, having examined the arms and tools,\r\nsaw nothing which could help them to establish the identity of the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThe capture of pigs, made on the islet, was looked upon as being very\r\nprofitable to Lincoln Island, and the animals were led to the sty, where\r\nthey soon became at home.\r\n\r\nThe two barrels, containing the powder and shot, as well as the box\r\nof caps, were very welcome. It was agreed to establish a small\r\npowder-magazine, either outside Granite House or in the Upper Cavern,\r\nwhere there would be no fear of explosion. However, the use of pyroxyle\r\nwas to be continued, for this substance giving excellent results, there\r\nwas no reason for substituting ordinary powder.\r\n\r\nWhen the unloading of the vessel was finished,--\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Pencroft, “I think it would be prudent to put our\r\n‘Bonadventure’ in a safe place.”\r\n\r\n“Is she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?” asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“No, captain,” replied the sailor. “Half of the time she is stranded on\r\nthe sand, and that works her. She is a famous craft, you see, and she\r\nbehaved admirably during the squall which struck us on our return.”\r\n\r\n“Could she not float in the river?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there, and in the\r\neast winds, I think that the ‘Bonadventure’ would suffer much from the\r\nsurf.”\r\n\r\n“Well, where would you put her, Pencroft?”\r\n\r\n“In Port Balloon,” replied the sailor. “That little creek, shut in by\r\nrocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not rather far?”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and we have a\r\nfine straight road to take us there!”\r\n\r\n“Do it then, Pencroft, and take your ‘Bonadventure’ there,” replied\r\nthe engineer, “and yet I would rather have her under our more immediate\r\nprotection. When we have time, we must make a little harbor for her.”\r\n\r\n“Famous!” exclaimed Pencroft. “A harbor with a lighthouse, a pier, and\r\ndock! Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes easy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my brave Pencroft,” answered the engineer, “but on condition,\r\nhowever, that you help me, for you do as much as three men in all our\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\nHerbert and the sailor then re-embarked on board the “Bonadventure,”\r\n the anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the wind drove her rapidly\r\ntowards Claw Cape. Two hours after, she was reposing on the tranquil\r\nwaters of Port Balloon.\r\n\r\nDuring the first days passed by the stranger in Granite House, had he\r\nalready given them reason to think that his savage nature was becoming\r\ntamed? Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind? In\r\nshort, was the soul returning to the body?\r\n\r\nYes, to a certainty, and to such a degree, that Cyrus Harding and the\r\nreporter wondered if the reason of the unfortunate man had ever been\r\ntotally extinguished. At first, accustomed to the open air, to the\r\nunrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on Tabor Island, the stranger\r\nmanifested a sullen fury, and it was feared that he might throw\r\nhimself onto the beach, out of one of the windows of Granite House.\r\nBut gradually he became calmer, and more freedom was allowed to his\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThey had reason to hope, and to hope much. Already, forgetting his\r\ncarnivorous instincts, the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment\r\nthan that on which he fed on the islet, and cooked meat did not produce\r\nin him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had showed on board\r\nthe “Bonadventure.” Cyrus Harding had profited by a moment when he was\r\nsleeping, to cut his hair and matted beard, which formed a sort of\r\nmane and gave him such a savage aspect. He had also been clothed more\r\nsuitably, after having got rid of the rag which covered him. The result\r\nwas that, thanks to these attentions, the stranger resumed a more\r\nhuman appearance, and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder.\r\nCertainly, when formerly lighted up by intelligence, this man’s face\r\nmust have had a sort of beauty.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Harding imposed on himself the task of passing some hours\r\nin his company. He came and worked near him, and occupied himself in\r\ndifferent things, so as to fix his attention. A spark, indeed, would be\r\nsufficient to reillumine that soul, a recollection crossing that brain\r\nto recall reason. That had been seen, during the storm, on board the\r\n“Bonadventure!” The engineer did not neglect either to speak aloud, so\r\nas to penetrate at the same time by the organs of hearing and sight the\r\ndepths of that torpid intelligence. Sometimes one of his companions,\r\nsometimes another, sometimes all joined him. They spoke most often of\r\nthings belonging to the navy, which must interest a sailor.\r\n\r\nAt times, the stranger gave some slight attention to what was said,\r\nand the settlers were soon convinced that he partly understood them.\r\nSometimes the expression of his countenance was deeply sorrowful, a\r\nproof that he suffered mentally, for his face could not be mistaken;\r\nbut he did not speak, although at different times, however, they almost\r\nthought that words were about to issue from his lips. At all events, the\r\npoor creature was quite quiet and sad!\r\n\r\nBut was not his calm only apparent? Was not his sadness only the result\r\nof his seclusion? Nothing could yet be ascertained. Seeing only certain\r\nobjects and in a limited space, always in contact with the colonists,\r\nto whom he would soon become accustomed, having no desires to satisfy,\r\nbetter fed, better clothed, it was natural that his physical nature\r\nshould gradually improve; but was he penetrated with the sense of a new\r\nlife? or rather, to employ a word which would be exactly applicable\r\nto him, was he not becoming tamed, like an animal in company with his\r\nmaster? This was an important question, which Cyrus Harding was anxious\r\nto answer, and yet he did not wish to treat his invalid roughly! Would\r\nhe ever be a convalescent?\r\n\r\nHow the engineer observed him every moment! How he was on the watch for\r\nhis soul, if one may use the expression! How he was ready to grasp it!\r\nThe settlers followed with real sympathy all the phases of the cure\r\nundertaken by Harding. They aided him also in this work of humanity, and\r\nall, except perhaps the incredulous Pencroft, soon shared both his hope\r\nand his faith.\r\n\r\nThe calm of the stranger was deep, as has been said, and he even showed\r\na sort of attachment for the engineer, whose influence he evidently\r\nfelt. Cyrus Harding resolved then to try him, by transporting him\r\nto another scene, from that ocean which formerly his eyes had been\r\naccustomed to contemplate, to the border of the forest, which might\r\nperhaps recall those where so many years of his life had been passed!\r\n\r\n“But,” said Gideon Spilett, “can we hope that he will not escape, if\r\nonce set at liberty?”\r\n\r\n“The experiment must be tried,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Pencroft. “When that fellow is outside, and feels the fresh\r\nair, he will be off as fast as his legs can carry him!”\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” returned Harding.\r\n\r\n“Let us try,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“We will try,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\nThis was on the 30th of October, and consequently the castaway of Tabor\r\nIsland had been a prisoner in Granite House for nine days. It was\r\nwarm, and a bright sun darted its rays on the island. Cyrus Harding and\r\nPencroft went to the room occupied by the stranger, who was found lying\r\nnear the window and gazing at the sky.\r\n\r\n“Come, my friend,” said the engineer to him.\r\n\r\nThe stranger rose immediately. His eyes were fixed on Cyrus Harding, and\r\nhe followed him, while the sailor marched behind them, little confident\r\nas to the result of the experiment.\r\n\r\nArrived at the door, Harding and Pencroft made him take his place in\r\nthe lift, while Neb, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett waited for them before\r\nGranite House. The lift descended, and in a few moments all were united\r\non the beach.\r\n\r\nThe settlers went a short distance from the stranger, so as to leave him\r\nat liberty.\r\n\r\nHe then made a few steps toward the sea, and his look brightened with\r\nextreme animation, but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape.\r\nHe was gazing at the little waves which, broken by the islet, rippled on\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\n“This is only the sea,” observed Gideon Spilett, “and possibly it does\r\nnot inspire him with any wish to escape!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Harding, “we must take him to the plateau, on the border\r\nof the forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, he could not run away,” said Neb, “since the bridge is\r\nraised.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Pencroft, “that isn’t a man to be troubled by a stream like\r\nCreek Glycerine! He could cross it directly, at a single bound!”\r\n\r\n“We shall soon see,” Harding contented himself with replying, his eyes\r\nnot quitting those of his patient.\r\n\r\nThe latter was then led towards the mouth of the Mercy, and all climbing\r\nthe left bank of the river, reached Prospect Heights.\r\n\r\nArrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the\r\nforest, their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the stranger\r\nappeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the\r\natmosphere, and a long sigh escaped from his chest.\r\n\r\nThe settlers kept behind him, ready to seize him if he made any movement\r\nto escape!\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the poor creature was on the point of springing into the\r\ncreek which separated him from the forest, and his legs were bent for an\r\ninstant as if for a spring, but almost immediately he stepped back, half\r\nsank down, and a large tear fell from his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding, “you have become a man again, for you can\r\nweep!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nYes! the unfortunate man had wept! Some recollection doubtless had\r\nflashed across his brain, and to use Cyrus Harding’s expression, by\r\nthose tears he was once more a man.\r\n\r\nThe colonists left him for some time on the plateau, and withdrew\r\nthemselves to a short distance, so that he might feel himself free; but\r\nhe did not think of profiting by this liberty, and Harding soon brought\r\nhim back to Granite House. Two days after this occurrence, the stranger\r\nappeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life. He\r\nevidently heard and understood, but no less evidently was he strangely\r\ndetermined not to speak to the colonists; for one evening, Pencroft,\r\nlistening at the door of his room, heard these words escape from his\r\nlips:--\r\n\r\n“No! here! I! never!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor reported these words to his companions.\r\n\r\n“There is some painful mystery there!” said Harding.\r\n\r\nThe stranger had begun to use the laboring tools, and he worked in the\r\ngarden. When he stopped in his work, as was often the case, he remained\r\nretired within himself, but on the engineer’s recommendation, they\r\nrespected the reserve which he apparently wished to keep. If one of the\r\nsettlers approached him, he drew back, and his chest heaved with sobs,\r\nas if overburdened!\r\n\r\nWas it remorse that overwhelmed him thus? They were compelled to believe\r\nso, and Gideon Spilett could not help one day making this observation,--\r\n\r\n“If he does not speak it is because he has, I fear, things too serious\r\nto be told!”\r\n\r\nThey must be patient and wait.\r\n\r\nA few days later, on the 3rd of November, the stranger, working on the\r\nplateau, had stopped, letting his spade drop to the ground, and Harding,\r\nwho was observing him from a little distance, saw that tears were again\r\nflowing from his eyes. A sort of irresistible pity led him towards the\r\nunfortunate man, and he touched his arm lightly.\r\n\r\n“My friend!” said he.\r\n\r\nThe stranger tried to avoid his look, and Cyrus Harding having\r\nendeavored to take his hand, he drew back quickly.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Harding in a firmer voice, “look at me, I wish it!”\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked at the engineer, and seemed to be under his power,\r\nas a subject under the influence of a mesmerist. He wished to run away.\r\nBut then his countenance suddenly underwent a transformation. His eyes\r\nflashed. Words struggled to escape from his lips. He could no longer\r\ncontain himself! At last he folded his arms; then, in a hollow\r\nvoice,--“Who are you?” he asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Castaways, like you,” replied the engineer, whose emotion was deep. “We\r\nhave brought you here, among your fellow-men.”\r\n\r\n“My fellow-men!.... I have none!”\r\n\r\n“You are in the midst of friends.”\r\n\r\n“Friends!--for me! friends!” exclaimed the stranger, hiding his face in\r\nhis hands. “No--never--leave me! leave me!”\r\n\r\nThen he rushed to the side of the plateau which overlooked the sea, and\r\nremained there a long time motionless.\r\n\r\nHarding rejoined his companions and related to them what had just\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n“Yes! there is some mystery in that man’s life,” said Gideon Spilett,\r\n“and it appears as if he had only re-entered society by the path of\r\nremorse.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what sort of a man we have brought here,” said the sailor.\r\n“He has secrets--”\r\n\r\n“Which we will respect,” interrupted Cyrus Harding quickly. “If he has\r\ncommitted any crime, he has most fearfully expiated it, and in our eyes\r\nhe is absolved.”\r\n\r\nFor two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore, evidently under\r\nthe influence of recollections which recalled all his past life--a\r\nmelancholy life doubtless--and the colonists, without losing sight of\r\nhim, did not attempt to disturb his solitude. However, after two hours,\r\nappearing to have formed a resolution, he came to find Cyrus Harding.\r\nHis eyes were red with the tears he had shed, but he wept no longer.\r\nHis countenance expressed deep humility. He appeared anxious, timorous,\r\nashamed, and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he to Harding, “your companions and you, are you English?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the engineer, “we are Americans.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the stranger, and he murmured, “I prefer that!”\r\n\r\n“And you, my friend?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“English,” replied he hastily.\r\n\r\nAnd as if these few words had been difficult to say, he retreated to the\r\nbeach, where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of\r\nthe Mercy, in a state of extreme agitation.\r\n\r\nThen, passing one moment close to Herbert, he stopped and in a stifled\r\nvoice,--\r\n\r\n“What month?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“December,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“What year?”\r\n\r\n“1866.”\r\n\r\n“Twelve years! twelve years!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThen he left him abruptly.\r\n\r\nHerbert reported to the colonists the questions and answers which had\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\n“This unfortunate man,” observed Gideon Spilett, “was no longer\r\nacquainted with either months or years!”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” added Herbert, “and he had been twelve years already on the islet\r\nwhen we found him there!”\r\n\r\n“Twelve years!” rejoined Harding. “Ah! twelve years of solitude, after a\r\nwicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man’s reason!”\r\n\r\n“I am induced to think,” said Pencroft, “that this man was not wrecked\r\non Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he was left\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“You must be right, Pencroft,” replied the reporter, “and if it is so\r\nit is not impossible that those who left him on the island may return to\r\nfetch him some day!”\r\n\r\n“And they will no longer find him,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“But then,” added Pencroft, “they must return, and--”\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, “do not let us discuss this question\r\nuntil we know more about it. I believe that the unhappy man has\r\nsuffered, that he has severely expiated his faults, whatever they may\r\nhave been, and that the wish to unburden himself stifles him. Do not let\r\nus press him to tell us his history! He will tell it to us doubtless,\r\nand when we know it, we shall see what course it will be best to follow.\r\nHe alone besides can tell us, if he has more than a hope, a certainty,\r\nof returning some day to his country, but I doubt it!”\r\n\r\n“And why?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Because that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered at a\r\ncertain time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance and would\r\nnot have thrown this document into the sea. No, it is more probable that\r\nhe was condemned to die on that islet, and that he never expected to see\r\nhis fellow-creatures again!”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed the sailor, “there is one thing which I cannot explain.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“If this man had been left for twelve years on Tabor Island, one may\r\nwell suppose that he had been several years already in the wild state in\r\nwhich we found him!”\r\n\r\n“That is probable,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“It must then be many years since he wrote that document!”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” and yet the document appears to have been recently written!\r\n\r\n“Besides, how do you know that the bottle which enclosed the document\r\nmay not have taken several years to come from Tabor Island to Lincoln\r\nIsland?”\r\n\r\n“That is not absolutely impossible,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Pencroft, “for it was still floating. We could not even\r\nsuppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on the shore, it\r\nwould have been swept off by the sea, for the south coast is all rocks,\r\nand it would certainly have been smashed to pieces there!”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“And then,” continued the sailor, “if the document was several years\r\nold, if it had been shut up in that bottle for several years, it would\r\nhave been injured by damp. Now, there is nothing of the kind, and it was\r\nfound in a perfect state of preservation.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor’s reasoning was very just, and pointed out an\r\nincomprehensible fact, for the document appeared to have been recently\r\nwritten, when the colonists found it in the bottle. Moreover, it gave\r\nthe latitude and longitude of Tabor Island correctly, which implied that\r\nits author had a more complete knowledge of hydrography than could be\r\nexpected of a common sailor.\r\n\r\n“There is in this, again, something unaccountable,” said the engineer,\r\n“but we will not urge our companion to speak. When he likes, my\r\nfriends, then we shall be ready to hear him!”\r\n\r\nDuring the following days the stranger did not speak a word, and did not\r\nonce leave the precincts of the plateau. He worked away, without losing\r\na moment, without taking a minute’s rest, but always in a retired place.\r\nAt meal times he never came to Granite House, although invited several\r\ntimes to do so, but contented himself with eating a few raw vegetables.\r\nAt nightfall he did not return to the room assigned to him, but remained\r\nunder some clump of trees, or when the weather was bad crouched in some\r\ncleft of the rocks. Thus he lived in the same manner as when he had no\r\nother shelter than the forests of Tabor Island, and as all persuasion\r\nto induce him to improve his life was in vain, the colonists\r\nwaited patiently. And the time was near, when, as it seemed, almost\r\ninvoluntarily urged by his conscience, a terrible confession escaped\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, about eight o’clock in the evening, as night\r\nwas coming on, the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the settlers,\r\nwho were assembled under the veranda. His eyes burned strangely, and he\r\nhad quite resumed the wild aspect of his worst days.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions were astounded on seeing that, overcome\r\nby some terrible emotion, his teeth chattered like those of a person\r\nin a fever. What was the matter with him? Was the sight of his\r\nfellow-creatures insupportable to him? Was he weary of this return to a\r\ncivilized mode of existence? Was he pining for his former savage\r\nlife? It appeared so, as soon he was heard to express himself in these\r\nincoherent sentences:--\r\n\r\n“Why am I here?.... By what right have you dragged me from my islet?....\r\nDo you think there could be any tie between you and me?.... Do you know\r\nwho I am--what I have done--why I was there--alone? And who told\r\nyou that I was not abandoned there--that I was not condemned to die\r\nthere?.... Do you know my past?.... How do you know that I have not\r\nstolen, murdered--that I am not a wretch--an accursed being--only fit to\r\nlive like a wild beast, far from all--speak--do you know it?”\r\n\r\nThe colonists listened without interrupting the miserable creature, from\r\nwhom these broken confessions escaped, as it were, in spite of himself.\r\nHarding wishing to calm him, approached him, but he hastily drew back.\r\n\r\n“No! no!” he exclaimed; “one word only--am I free?”\r\n\r\n“You are free,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, then!” he cried, and fled like a madman.\r\n\r\nNeb, Pencroft, and Herbert ran also towards the edge of the wood--but\r\nthey returned alone.\r\n\r\n“We must let him alone!” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“He will never come back!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“He will come back,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\nMany days passed; but Harding--was it a sort of\r\npresentiment?--persisted in the fixed idea that sooner or later the\r\nunhappy man would return.\r\n\r\n“It is the last revolt of his wild nature,” said he, “which remorse has\r\ntouched, and which renewed solitude will terrify.”\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, works of all sorts were continued, as well on Prospect\r\nHeights as at the corral, where Harding intended to build a farm. It is\r\nunnecessary to say that the seeds collected by Herbert on Tabor\r\nIsland had been carefully sown. The plateau thus formed one immense\r\nkitchen-garden, well laid out and carefully tended, so that the arms of\r\nthe settlers were never in want of work. There was always something to\r\nbe done. As the esculents increased in number, it became necessary to\r\nenlarge the simple beds, which threatened to grow into regular fields\r\nand replace the meadows. But grass abounded in other parts of the\r\nisland, and there was no fear of the onagers being obliged to go on\r\nshort allowance. It was well worth while, besides, to turn Prospect\r\nHeights into a kitchen-garden, defended by its deep belt of creeks, and\r\nto remove them to the meadows, which had no need of protection against\r\nthe depredations of quadrumana and quadrapeds.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of November, the third harvest was gathered in. How\r\nwonderfully had the field increased in extent, since eighteen months\r\nago, when the first grain of wheat was sown! The second crop of six\r\nhundred thousand grains produced this time four thousand bushels, or\r\nfive hundred millions of grains!\r\n\r\nThe colony was rich in corn, for ten bushels alone were sufficient for\r\nsowing every year to produce an ample crop for the food both of men and\r\nbeasts. The harvest was completed, and the last fortnight of the month\r\nof November was devoted to the work of converting it into food for man.\r\nIn fact, they had corn, but not flour, and the establishment of a mill\r\nwas necessary. Cyrus Harding could have utilized the second fall which\r\nflowed into the Mercy to establish his motive power, the first\r\nbeing already occupied with moving the felting mill, but, after some\r\nconsultation, it was decided that a simple windmill should be built on\r\nProspect Heights. The building of this presented no more difficulty than\r\nthe building of the former, and it was moreover certain that there would\r\nbe no want of wind on the plateau, exposed as it was to the sea breezes.\r\n\r\n“Not to mention,” said Pencroft, “that the windmill will be more lively\r\nand will have a good effect in the landscape!”\r\n\r\nThey set to work by choosing timber for the frame and machinery of the\r\nmill. Some large stones, found at the north of the lake, could be easily\r\ntransformed into millstones, and as to the sails, the inexhaustible case\r\nof the balloon furnished the necessary material.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding made his model, and the site of the mill was chosen a\r\nlittle to the right of the poultry-yard, near the shore of the lake. The\r\nframe was to rest on a pivot supported with strong timbers, so that it\r\ncould turn with all the machinery it contained according as the wind\r\nrequired it. The work advanced rapidly. Neb and Pencroft had become\r\nvery skilful carpenters, and had nothing to do but to copy the models\r\nprovided by the engineer.\r\n\r\nSoon a sort of cylindrical box, in shape like a pepper-pot, with a\r\npointed roof, rose on the spot chosen. The four frames which formed the\r\nsails had been firmly fixed in the center beam, so as to form a certain\r\nangle with it, and secured with iron clamps. As to the different\r\nparts of the internal mechanism, the box destined to contain the two\r\nmillstones, the fixed stone and the moving stone, the hopper, a sort of\r\nlarge square trough, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, which would\r\nallow the grain to fall on the stones, the oscillating spout intended to\r\nregulate the passing of the grain, and lastly the bolting machine, which\r\nby the operation of sifting, separates the bran from the flour,\r\nwere made without difficulty. The tools were good, and the work not\r\ndifficult, for in reality, the machinery of a mill is very simple. This\r\nwas only a question of time.\r\n\r\nEvery one had worked at the construction of the mill, and on the 1st\r\nof December it was finished. As usual, Pencroft was delighted with his\r\nwork, and had no doubt that the apparatus was perfect.\r\n\r\n“Now for a good wind,” said he, “and we shall grind our first harvest\r\nsplendidly!”\r\n\r\n“A good wind, certainly,” answered the engineer, “but not too much,\r\nPencroft.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! our mill would only go the faster!”\r\n\r\n“There is no need for it to go so very fast,” replied Cyrus Harding. “It\r\nis known by experience that the greatest quantity of work is performed\r\nby a mill when the number of turns made by the sails in a minute is six\r\ntimes the number of feet traversed by the wind in a second. A moderate\r\nbreeze, which passes over twenty-four feet to the second, will give\r\nsixteen turns to the sails during a minute, and there is no need of\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly!” cried Herbert, “a fine breeze is blowing from the northeast,\r\nwhich will soon do our business for us.”\r\n\r\nThere was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill, for the\r\nsettlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in Lincoln Island.\r\nOn this morning two or three bushels of wheat were ground, and the next\r\nday at breakfast a magnificent loaf, a little heavy perhaps, although\r\nraised with yeast, appeared on the table at Granite House. Every one\r\nmunched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily understood.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared. Several times Gideon\r\nSpilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite\r\nHouse, without meeting or finding any trace of him. They became\r\nseriously uneasy at this prolonged absence. Certainly, the former\r\nsavage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest,\r\nabounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his\r\nhabits, and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts?\r\nHowever, Harding, by a sort of presentiment, doubtless, always persisted\r\nin saying that the fugitive would return.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he will return!” he repeated with a confidence which his\r\ncompanions could not share. “When this unfortunate man was on Tabor\r\nIsland, he knew himself to be alone! Here, he knows that fellow-men are\r\nawaiting him! Since he has partially spoken of his past life, the poor\r\npenitent will return to tell the whole, and from that day he will belong\r\nto us!”\r\n\r\nThe event justified Cyrus Harding’s predictions. On the 3rd of December,\r\nHerbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the southern bank of the\r\nlake. He was unarmed, and till then had never taken any precautions for\r\ndefense, as dangerous animals had not shown themselves on that part of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry-yard, while\r\nHarding and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in making soda,\r\nthe store of soap being exhausted.\r\n\r\nSuddenly cries resounded,--\r\n\r\n“Help! help!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance, had not\r\nbeen able to hear the shouts. Pencroft and Neb, leaving the poultry-yard\r\nin all haste, rushed towards the lake.\r\n\r\nBut before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no one had\r\nsuspected, crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the plateau from the\r\nforest, and bounded up the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nHerbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to the\r\none which had been killed on Reptile End. Suddenly surprised, he was\r\nstanding with his back against a tree, while the animal gathering itself\r\ntogether was about to spring.\r\n\r\nBut the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on the\r\nformidable animal, who turned to meet this new adversary.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was short. The stranger possessed immense strength and\r\nactivity. He seized the jaguar’s throat with one powerful hand, holding\r\nit as in a vise, without heeding the beast’s claws which tore his flesh,\r\nand with the other he plunged his knife into its heart.\r\n\r\nThe jaguar fell. The stranger kicked away the body, and was about to\r\nfly at the moment when the settlers arrived on the field of battle, but\r\nHerbert, clinging to him, cried,--\r\n\r\n“No, no! you shall not go!”\r\n\r\nHarding advanced towards the stranger, who frowned when he saw him\r\napproaching. The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt,\r\nbut he took no notice of it.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Cyrus Harding, “we have just contracted a debt of\r\ngratitude to you. To save our boy you have risked your life!”\r\n\r\n“My life!” murmured the stranger. “What is that worth? Less than\r\nnothing!”\r\n\r\n“You are wounded?”\r\n\r\n“It is no matter.”\r\n\r\n“Will you give me your hand?”\r\n\r\nAnd as Herbert endeavored to seize the hand which had just saved him,\r\nthe stranger folded his arms, his chest heaved, his look darkened, and\r\nhe appeared to wish to escape, but making a violent effort over himself,\r\nand in an abrupt tone,--\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked, “and what do you claim to be to me?”\r\n\r\nIt was the colonists’ history which he thus demanded, and for the first\r\ntime. Perhaps this history recounted, he would tell his own.\r\n\r\nIn a few words Harding related all that had happened since their\r\ndeparture from Richmond; how they had managed, and what resources they\r\nnow had at their disposal.\r\n\r\nThe stranger listened with extreme attention.\r\n\r\nThen the engineer told who they all were, Gideon Spilett, Herbert,\r\nPencroft, Neb, himself, and, he added, that the greatest happiness they\r\nhad felt since their arrival in Lincoln Island was on the return of the\r\nvessel from Tabor Island, when they had been able to include among them\r\na new companion.\r\n\r\nAt these words the stranger’s face flushed, his head sunk on his breast,\r\nand confusion was depicted on his countenance.\r\n\r\n“And now that you know us,” added Cyrus Harding, “will you give us your\r\nhand?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the stranger in a hoarse voice; “no! You are honest men!\r\nAnd I--”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\nThese last words justified the colonists’ presentiment. There had been\r\nsome mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men, but from which\r\nhis conscience had not yet absolved him. At any rate the guilty man felt\r\nremorse, he repented, and his new friends would have cordially pressed\r\nthe hand which they sought; but he did not feel himself worthy to extend\r\nit to honest men! However, after the scene with the jaguar, he did not\r\nreturn to the forest, and from that day did not go beyond the enclosure\r\nof Granite House.\r\n\r\nWhat was the mystery of his life? Would the stranger one day speak of\r\nit? Time alone could show. At any rate, it was agreed that his secret\r\nshould never be asked from him, and that they would live with him as if\r\nthey suspected nothing.\r\n\r\nFor some days their life continued as before. Cyrus Harding and Gideon\r\nSpilett worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes experimentalists.\r\nThe reporter never left the engineer except to hunt with Herbert, for\r\nit would not have been prudent to allow the lad to ramble alone in the\r\nforest; and it was very necessary to be on their guard. As to Neb\r\nand Pencroft, one day at the stables and poultry-yard, another at the\r\ncorral, without reckoning work in Granite House, they were never in want\r\nof employment.\r\n\r\nThe stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life, never\r\nappearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau, never\r\nmingling with his companions. It really seemed as if the society of\r\nthose who had saved him was insupportable to him!\r\n\r\n“But then,” observed Pencroft, “why did he entreat the help of his\r\nfellow-creatures? Why did he throw that paper into the sea?”\r\n\r\n“He will tell us why,” invariably replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps sooner than you think, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the day of confession was near.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House,\r\nHarding saw the stranger approaching, who, in a calm voice and humble\r\ntone, said to him: “Sir, I have a request to make of you.”\r\n\r\n“Speak,” answered the engineer, “but first let me ask you a question.”\r\n\r\nAt these words the stranger reddened, and was on the point of\r\nwithdrawing. Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in the mind of\r\nthe guilty man, who doubtless feared that the engineer would interrogate\r\nhim on his past life.\r\n\r\nHarding held him back.\r\n\r\n“Comrade,” said he, “we are not only your companions but your friends. I\r\nwish you to believe that, and now I will listen to you.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger pressed his hand over his eyes. He was seized with a\r\nsort of trembling, and remained a few moments without being able to\r\narticulate a word.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he at last, “I have come to beg you to grant me a favor.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“You have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your domesticated\r\nanimals. These animals need to be taken care of. Will you allow me to\r\nlive there with them?”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments with a\r\nfeeling of deep commiseration; then,--\r\n\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said he, “the corral has only stables hardly fit for\r\nanimals.”\r\n\r\n“It will be good enough for me, sir.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” answered Harding, “we will not constrain you in anything.\r\nYou wish to live at the corral, so be it. You will, however, be always\r\nwelcome at Granite House. But since you wish to live at the corral\r\nwe will make the necessary arrangements for your being comfortably\r\nestablished there.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind that, I shall do very well.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” answered Harding, who always intentionally made use of this\r\ncordial appellation, “you must let us judge what it will be best to do\r\nin this respect.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” replied the stranger as he withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had\r\nbeen made to him, and it was agreed that they should build a wooden\r\nhouse at the corral, which they would make as comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\nThat very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the necessary\r\ntools, and a week had not passed before the house was ready to receive\r\nits tenant. It was built about twenty feet from the sheds, and from\r\nthere it was easy to overlook the flock of sheep, which then numbered\r\nmore than eighty. Some furniture, a bed, table, bench, cupboard, and\r\nchest were manufactured, and a gun, ammunition, and tools were carried\r\nto the corral.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, however, had seen nothing of his new dwelling, and he\r\nhad allowed the settlers to work there without him, while he occupied\r\nhimself on the plateau, wishing, doubtless, to put the finishing stroke\r\nto his work. Indeed, thanks to him, all the ground was dug up and ready\r\nto be sowed when the time came.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral\r\nwere completed. The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling\r\nwas ready to receive him, and the latter replied that he would go and\r\nsleep there that very evening.\r\n\r\nOn this evening the colonists were gathered in the diningroom of Granite\r\nHouse. It was then eight o’clock, the hour at which their companion was\r\nto leave them. Not wishing to trouble him by their presence, and thus\r\nimposing on him the necessity of saying farewells which might perhaps be\r\npainful to him, they had left him alone and ascended to Granite House.\r\n\r\nNow, they had been talking in the room for a few minutes, when a light\r\nknock was heard at the door. Almost immediately the stranger entered,\r\nand without any preamble,--\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “before I leave you, it is right that you should\r\nknow my history. I will tell it you.”\r\n\r\nThese simple words profoundly impressed Cyrus Harding and his\r\ncompanions. The engineer rose.\r\n\r\n“We ask you nothing, my friend,” said he; “it is your right to be\r\nsilent.”\r\n\r\n“It is my duty to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, then.”\r\n\r\n“No, I will stand.”\r\n\r\n“We are ready to hear you,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\nThe stranger remained standing in a corner of the room, a little in the\r\nshade. He was bareheaded, his arms folded across his chest, and it\r\nwas in this posture that in a hoarse voice, speaking like some one\r\nwho obliges himself to speak, he gave the following recital, which his\r\nauditors did not once interrupt:--\r\n\r\n“On the 20th of December, 1854, a steam-yacht, belonging to a Scotch\r\nnobleman, Lord Glenarvan, anchored off Cape Bernouilli, on the western\r\ncoast of Australia, in the thirty-seventh parallel. On board this yacht\r\nwere Lord Glenarvan and his wife, a major in the English army, a French\r\ngeographer, a young girl, and a young boy. These two last were the\r\nchildren of Captain Grant, whose ship, the ‘Britannia,’ had been lost,\r\ncrew and cargo, a year before. The ‘Duncan’ was commanded by Captain\r\nJohn Mangles, and manned by a crew of fifteen men.\r\n\r\n“This is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of\r\nAustralia. Six months before, a bottle, enclosing a document written in\r\nEnglish, German, and French, had been found in the Irish Sea, and picked\r\nup by the ‘Duncan.’ This document stated in substance that there still\r\nexisted three survivors from the wreck of the ‘Britannia,’ that these\r\nsurvivors were Captain Grant and two of his men, and that they had found\r\nrefuge on some land, of which the document gave the latitude, but of\r\nwhich the longitude, effaced by the sea, was no longer legible.\r\n\r\n“This latitude was 37deg 11’ south; therefore, the longitude being\r\nunknown, if they followed the thirty-seventh parallel over continents\r\nand seas, they would be certain to reach the spot inhabited by Captain\r\nGrant and his two companions. The English Admiralty having hesitated to\r\nundertake this search, Lord Glenarvan resolved to attempt everything to\r\nfind the captain. He communicated with Mary and Robert Grant, who joined\r\nhim. The ‘Duncan’ yacht was equipped for the distant voyage, in which\r\nthe nobleman’s family and the captain’s children wished to take part,\r\nand the ‘Duncan,’ leaving Glasgow, proceeded towards the Atlantic,\r\npassed through the Straits of Magellan, and ascended the Pacific as\r\nfar as Patagonia, where, according to a previous interpretation of the\r\ndocument, they supposed that Captain Grant was a prisoner among the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Duncan’ disembarked her passengers on the western coast of\r\nPatagonia, and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at\r\nCape Corrientes. Lord Glenarvan traversed Patagonia, following the\r\nthirty-seventh parallel, and having found no trace of the captain, he\r\nre-embarked on the 13th of November, so as to pursue his search through\r\nthe Ocean.\r\n\r\n“After having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan d’Acunha and\r\nAmsterdam, situated in her course, the ‘Duncan,’ as I have said, arrived\r\nat Cape Bernouilli, on the Australian coast, on the 20th of December,\r\n1854.\r\n\r\n“It was Lord Glenarvan’s intention to traverse Australia as he had\r\ntraversed America, and he disembarked. A few miles from the coast was\r\nestablished a farm, belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to\r\nthe travelers. Lord Glenarvan made known to the Irishman the cause\r\nwhich had brought him to these parts, and asked if he knew whether a\r\nthree-masted English vessel, the ‘Britannia,’ had been lost less than\r\ntwo years before on the west coast of Australia.\r\n\r\n“The Irishman had never heard of this wreck, but, to the great surprise\r\nof the bystanders, one of his servants came forward and said,--\r\n\r\n“‘My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is still living, he is\r\nliving on the Australian shores.’\r\n\r\n“‘Who are you?’ asked Lord Glenarvan.\r\n\r\n“‘A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,’ replied the man; ‘I am one of\r\nCaptain Grant’s crew--one of the castaways of the “Britannia.’”\r\n\r\n“This man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the boatswain’s mate of\r\nthe ‘Britannia,’ as his papers showed. But, separated from Captain Grant\r\nat the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he had till then\r\nbelieved that the captain with all his crew had perished, and that he,\r\nAyrton, was the sole survivor of the ‘Britannia.’\r\n\r\n“‘Only,’ he added, ‘it was not on the west coast, but on the east coast\r\nof Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain Grant is still\r\nliving, as his document indicates, he is a prisoner among the natives,\r\nand it is on the other coast that he must be looked for.’\r\n\r\n“This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his words\r\ncould not be doubted. The Irishman, in whose service he had been for\r\nmore than a year, answered for his trustworthiness. Lord Glenarvan,\r\ntherefore, believed in the fidelity of this man and, by his advice,\r\nresolved to cross Australia, following the thirty-seventh parallel. Lord\r\nGlenarvan, his wife, the two children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain\r\nMangles, and a few sailors composed the little band under the command\r\nof Ayrton, while the ‘Duncan,’ under charge of the mate, Tom Austin,\r\nproceeded to Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan’s instructions.\r\n\r\n“They set out on the 23rd of December, 1854.\r\n\r\n“It is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed, the\r\nboatswain’s mate of the ‘Britannia,’ but, after some dispute with his\r\ncaptain, he endeavored to incite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship,\r\nand Captain Grant had landed him, on the 8th of April, 1852, on the\r\nwest coast of Australia, and then sailed, leaving him there, as was only\r\njust.\r\n\r\n“Therefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the\r\n‘Britannia’; he had just heard of it from Glenarvan’s account. Since his\r\nabandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of\r\nthe escaped convicts; and if he boldly maintained that the wreck had\r\ntaken place on the east coast, and led Lord Glenarvan to proceed in that\r\ndirection, it was that he hoped to separate him from his ship, seize the\r\n‘Duncan,’ and make the yacht a pirate in the Pacific.”\r\n\r\nHere the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but he\r\ncontinued,--\r\n\r\n“The expedition set out and proceeded across Australia. It was\r\ninevitably unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be\r\ncalled, guided it, sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his band of\r\nconvicts, who had been told what they had to do.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, the ‘Duncan’ had been sent to Melbourne for repairs. It was\r\nnecessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave Melbourne\r\nand go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be easy to seize\r\nher. After having led the expedition near enough to the coast, in the\r\nmidst of vast forests with no resources, Ayrton obtained a letter, which\r\nhe was charged to carry to the mate of the ‘Duncan’--a letter which\r\nordered the yacht to repair immediately to the east coast, to Twofold\r\nBay, that is to say a few days’ journey from the place where the\r\nexpedition had stopped. It was there that Ayrton had agreed to meet his\r\naccomplices, and two days after gaining possession of the letter, he\r\narrived at Melbourne.\r\n\r\n“So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design. He would be able\r\nto take the ‘Duncan’ into Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the\r\nconvicts to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would become\r\nmaster of the seas. But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of\r\nthese terrible projects.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton, arrived at Melbourne, delivered the letter to the mate, Tom\r\nAustin, who read it and immediately set sail, but judge of Ayrton’s rage\r\nand disappointment, when the next day he found that the mate was taking\r\nthe vessel, not to the east coast of Australia, to Twofold Bay, but to\r\nthe east coast of New Zealand. He wished to stop him, but Austin showed\r\nhim the letter!... And indeed, by a providential error of the French\r\ngeographer, who had written the letter, the east coast of New Zealand\r\nwas mentioned as the place of destination.\r\n\r\n“All Ayrton’s plans were frustrated! He became outrageous. They put him\r\nin irons. He was then taken to the coast of New Zealand, not knowing\r\nwhat would become of his accomplices, or what would become of Lord\r\nGlenarvan.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Duncan’ cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March. On\r\nthat day Ayrton heard the report of guns. The guns on the ‘Duncan’ were\r\nbeing fired, and soon Lord Glenarvan and his companions came on board.\r\n\r\n“This is what had happened.\r\n\r\n“After a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had\r\naccomplished his journey, and arrived on the east coast of Australia, at\r\nTwofold Bay. ‘No “Duncan!”’ He telegraphed to Melbourne. They answered,\r\n“Duncan” sailed on the 18th instant. Destination unknown.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Glenarvan could only arrive at one conclusion; that his honest\r\nyacht had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a pirate\r\nvessel!\r\n\r\n“However, Lord Glenarvan would not give up. He was a bold and generous\r\nman. He embarked in a merchant vessel, sailed to the west coast of New\r\nZealand, traversed it along the thirty-seventh parallel, without\r\nfinding any trace of Captain Grant; but on the other side, to his\r\ngreat surprise, and by the will of Heaven, he found the ‘Duncan,’ under\r\ncommand of the mate, who had been waiting for him for five weeks!\r\n\r\n“This was on the 3rd of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was now on board the\r\n‘Duncan,’ but Ayrton was there also. He appeared before the nobleman,\r\nwho wished to extract from him all that the villain knew about Captain\r\nGrant. Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan then told him, that at\r\nthe first port they put into, he would be delivered up to the English\r\nauthorities. Ayrton remained mute.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Duncan’ continued her voyage along the thirty-seventh parallel.\r\nIn the meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to vanquish the resistance of\r\nthe ruffian.\r\n\r\n“At last, her influence prevailed, and Ayrton, in exchange for what he\r\ncould tell, proposed that Lord Glenarvan should leave him on some island\r\nin the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English authorities.\r\nLord Glenarvan, resolving to do anything to obtain information about\r\nCaptain Grant, consented.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he knew\r\nnothing from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on the\r\nAustralian coast.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had given. The\r\n‘Duncan’ continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor Island. It was there\r\nthat Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there also that, by a\r\nveritable miracle, they found Captain Grant and two men, exactly on the\r\nthirty-seventh parallel.\r\n\r\n“The convict, then, went to take their place on this desert islet, and\r\nat the moment he left the yacht these words were pronounced by Lord\r\nGlenarvan:--\r\n\r\n“‘Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any possible\r\ncommunication with your fellow-creatures. You cannot escape from this\r\nislet on which the ‘Duncan’ leaves you. You will be alone, under the eye\r\nof a God who reads the depths of the heart, but you will be neither\r\nlost nor forgotten, as was Captain Grant. Unworthy as you are to be\r\nremembered by men, men will remember you. I know where you are Ayrton,\r\nand I know where to find you. I will never forget it!\r\n\r\n“And the ‘Duncan,’ making sail, soon disappeared. This was 18th of\r\nMarch, 1855.\r\n\r\n     (The events which have just been briefly related are taken\r\n     from a work which some of our readers have no doubt read,\r\n     and which is entitled, “Captain Grant’s children.” They will\r\n     remark on this occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy\r\n     in the dates; but later again, they will understand why the\r\n     real dates were not at first given.)\r\n\r\n“Ayrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition, weapons,\r\ntools, or seeds.\r\n\r\n“At his, the convict’s disposal, was the house built by honest Captain\r\nGrant. He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he\r\nhad committed.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was very\r\nmiserable! He said to himself, that if men came some day to take\r\nhim from that islet, he must be worthy to return among them! How he\r\nsuffered, that wretched man! How he labored to recover himself by work!\r\nHow he prayed to be reformed by prayer! For two years, three years, this\r\nwent on, but Ayrton, humbled by solitude, always looking for some ship\r\nto appear on the horizon, asking himself if the time of expiation would\r\nsoon be complete, suffered as none other suffered! Oh! how dreadful was\r\nthis solitude, to a heart tormented by remorse!\r\n\r\n“But doubtless Heaven had not sufficiently punished this unhappy man,\r\nfor he felt that he was gradually becoming a savage! He felt that\r\nbrutishness was gradually gaining on him!\r\n\r\n“He could not say if it was after two or three years of solitude, but at\r\nlast he became the miserable creature you found!\r\n\r\n“I have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce, and I,\r\nare the same.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions rose at the end of this account. It\r\nis impossible to say how much they were moved! What misery, grief, and\r\ndespair lay revealed before them!\r\n\r\n“Ayrton,” said Harding, rising, “you have been a great criminal, but\r\nHeaven must certainly think that you have expiated your crimes! That\r\nhas been proved by your having been brought again among your\r\nfellow-creatures. Ayrton, you are forgiven! And now you will be our\r\ncompanion?”\r\n\r\nAyrton drew back.\r\n\r\n“Here is my hand!” said the engineer.\r\n\r\nAyrton grasped the hand which Harding extended to him, and great tears\r\nfell from his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Will you live with us?” asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding, leave me some time longer,” replied Ayrton, “leave me\r\nalone in the hut in the corral!”\r\n\r\n“As you like, Ayrton,” answered Cyrus Harding. Ayrton was going to\r\nwithdraw, when the engineer addressed one more question to him:--\r\n\r\n“One word more, my friend. Since it was your intention to live alone,\r\nwhy did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?”\r\n\r\n“A document?” repeated Ayrton, who did not appear to know what he meant.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the document which we found enclosed in a bottle, giving us the\r\nexact position of Tabor Island!”\r\n\r\nAyrton passed his hand over his brow, then after having thought, “I\r\nnever threw any document into the sea!” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Never?” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\nAnd Ayrton, bowing, reached the door and departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\n“Poor man!” said Herbert, who had rushed to the door, but returned,\r\nhaving seen Ayrton slide down the rope on the lift and disappear in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n“He will come back,” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Come, now, captain,” exclaimed Pencroft, “what does that mean? What!\r\nwasn’t it Ayrton who threw that bottle into the sea? Who was it then?”\r\n\r\nCertainly, if ever a question was necessary to be made, it was that one!\r\n\r\n“It was he,” answered Neb, “only the unhappy man was half-mad.”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Herbert, “and he was no longer conscious of what he was\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\n“It can only be explained in that way, my friends,” replied Harding\r\nquickly, “and I understand now how Ayrton was able to point out exactly\r\nthe situation of Tabor Island, since the events which had preceded his\r\nbeing left on the island had made it known to him.”\r\n\r\n“However,” observed Pencroft, “if he was not yet a brute when he wrote\r\nthat document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight years ago,\r\nhow is it that the paper has not been injured by damp?”\r\n\r\n“That proves,” answered Cyrus Harding, “that Ayrton was deprived of\r\nintelligence at a more recent time than he thinks.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it must be so,” replied Pencroft, “without that the fact\r\nwould be unaccountable.”\r\n\r\n“Unaccountable indeed,” answered the engineer, who did not appear\r\ndesirous to prolong the conversation.\r\n\r\n“But has Ayrton told the truth?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the reporter. “The story which he has told is true in\r\nevery point. I remember quite well the account in the newspapers of the\r\nyacht expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan, and its result.”\r\n\r\n“Ayrton has told the truth,” added Harding. “Do not doubt it, Pencroft,\r\nfor it was painful to him. People tell the truth when they accuse\r\nthemselves like that!”\r\n\r\nThe next day--the 21st of December--the colonists descended to the\r\nbeach, and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton. He\r\nhad reached his house in the corral during the night and the settlers\r\njudged it best not to agitate him by their presence. Time would\r\ndoubtless perform what sympathy had been unable to accomplish.\r\n\r\nHerbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations. On this\r\nday the same work brought Harding and the reporter to the workshop at\r\nthe Chimneys.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my dear Cyrus,” said Gideon Spilett, “that the explanation\r\nyou gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied me at\r\nall! How can it be supposed that the unfortunate man was able to write\r\nthat document and throw the bottle into the sea without having the\r\nslightest recollection of it?”\r\n\r\n“Nor was it he who threw it in, my dear Spilett.”\r\n\r\n“You think then--”\r\n\r\n“I think nothing, I know nothing!” interrupted Cyrus Harding. “I am\r\ncontent to rank this incident among those which I have not been able to\r\nexplain to this day!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Cyrus,” said Spilett, “these things are incredible! Your\r\nrescue, the case stranded on the sand, Top’s adventure, and lastly this\r\nbottle... Shall we never have the answer to these enigmas?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” replied the engineer quickly, “yes, even if I have to penetrate\r\ninto the bowels of this island!”\r\n\r\n“Chance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery!”\r\n\r\n“Chance! Spilett! I do not believe in chance, any more than I believe in\r\nmysteries in this world. There is a reason for everything unaccountable\r\nwhich has happened here, and that reason I shall discover. But in the\r\nmeantime we must work and observe.”\r\n\r\nThe month of January arrived. The year 1867 commenced. The summer\r\noccupations were assiduously continued. During the days which followed,\r\nHerbert and Spilett having gone in the direction of the corral,\r\nascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of the habitation which\r\nhad been prepared for him. He busied himself with the numerous flock\r\nconfided to his care, and spared his companions the trouble of coming\r\nevery two or three days to visit the corral. Nevertheless, in order not\r\nto leave Ayrton in solitude for too long a time, the settlers often paid\r\nhim a visit.\r\n\r\nIt was not unimportant either, in consequence of some suspicions\r\nentertained by the engineer and Gideon Spilett, that this part of\r\nthe island should be subject to a surveillance of some sort, and that\r\nAyrton, if any incident occurred unexpectedly, should not neglect to\r\ninform the inhabitants of Granite House of it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it might happen that something would occur which it would\r\nbe necessary to bring rapidly to the engineer’s knowledge. Independently\r\nof facts bearing on the mystery of Lincoln Island, many others\r\nmight happen, which would call for the prompt interference of the\r\ncolonists,--such as the sighting of a vessel, a wreck on the western\r\ncoast, the possible arrival of pirates, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore Cyrus Harding resolved to put the corral in instantaneous\r\ncommunication with Granite House.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 10th of January that he made known his project to his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n“Why! how are you going to manage that, captain?” asked Pencroft. “Do\r\nyou by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Electric?” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Electric,” replied Cyrus Harding. “We have all the necessary materials\r\nfor making a battery, and the most difficult thing will be to stretch\r\nthe wires, but by means of a drawplate I think we shall manage it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, after that,” returned the sailor, “I shall never despair of\r\nseeing ourselves some day rolling along on a railway!”\r\n\r\nThey then set to work, beginning with the most difficult thing, for, if\r\nthey failed in that, it would be useless to manufacture the battery and\r\nother accessories.\r\n\r\nThe iron of Lincoln Island, as has been said, was of excellent quality,\r\nand consequently very fit for being drawn out. Harding commenced by\r\nmanufacturing a drawplate, that is to say, a plate of steel, pierced\r\nwith conical holes of different sizes, which would successively bring\r\nthe wire to the wished-for tenacity. This piece of steel, after having\r\nbeen tempered, was fixed in as firm a way as possible in a solid\r\nframework planted in the ground, only a few feet from the great fall,\r\nthe motive power of which the engineer intended to utilize. In fact as\r\nthe fulling-mill was there, although not then in use, its beam moved\r\nwith extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it\r\nround itself. It was a delicate operation, and required much care. The\r\niron, prepared previously in long thin rods, the ends of which were\r\nsharpened with the file, having been introduced into the largest hole of\r\nthe drawplate, was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself,\r\nto a length of twenty-five or thirty feet, then unrolled, and the same\r\noperation was performed successively through the holes of a less size.\r\nFinally, the engineer obtained wires from forty to fifty feet long,\r\nwhich could be easily fastened together and stretched over the distance\r\nof five miles, which separated the corral from the bounds of Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIt did not take more than a few days to perform this work, and indeed\r\nas soon as the machine had been commenced, Cyrus Harding left his\r\ncompanions to follow the trade of wiredrawers, and occupied himself with\r\nmanufacturing his battery.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to obtain a battery with a constant current. It is\r\nknown that the elements of modern batteries are generally composed of\r\nretort coal, zinc, and copper. Copper was absolutely wanting to the\r\nengineer, who, notwithstanding all his researches, had never been able\r\nto find any trace of it in Lincoln Island, and was therefore obliged to\r\ndo without it. Retort coal, that is to say, the hard graphite which\r\nis found in the retorts of gas manufactories, after the coal has\r\nbeen dehydrogenized, could have been obtained, but it would have been\r\nnecessary to establish a special apparatus, involving great labor. As\r\nto zinc, it may be remembered that the case found at Flotsam Point was\r\nlined with this metal, which could not be better utilized than for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, after mature consideration, decided to manufacture a\r\nvery simple battery, resembling as nearly as possible that invented\r\nby Becquerel in 1820, and in which zinc only is employed. The other\r\nsubstances, azotic acid and potash, were all at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the battery was composed was as follows, and the\r\nresults were to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash on each\r\nother. A number of glass bottles were made and filled with azotic acid.\r\nThe engineer corked them by means of a stopper through which passed a\r\nglass tube, bored at its lower extremity, and intended to be plunged\r\ninto the acid by means of a clay stopper secured by a rag. Into this\r\ntube, through its upper extremity, he poured a solution of potash,\r\npreviously obtained by burning and reducing to ashes various plants,\r\nand in this way the acid and potash could act on each other through the\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding then took two slips of zinc, one of which was plunged\r\ninto azotic acid, the other into a solution of potash. A current was\r\nimmediately produced, which was transmitted from the slip of zinc in the\r\nbottle to that in the tube, and the two slips having been connected by a\r\nmetallic wire the slip in the tube became the positive pole, and that in\r\nthe bottle the negative pole of the apparatus. Each bottle, therefore,\r\nproduced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all\r\nthe phenomena of the electric telegraph. Such was the ingenious and very\r\nsimple apparatus constructed by Cyrus Harding, an apparatus which would\r\nallow them to establish a telegraphic communication between Granite\r\nHouse and the corral.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of February was commenced the planting along the road to\r\nthe corral, of posts furnished with glass insulators, and intended to\r\nsupport the wire. A few days after, the wire was extended, ready to\r\nproduce the electric current at a rate of twenty thousand miles a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nTwo batteries had been manufactured, one for Granite House, the other\r\nfor the corral; for if it was necessary the corral should be able to\r\ncommunicate with Granite House it might also be useful that Granite\r\nHouse should be able to communicate with the corral.\r\n\r\nAs to the receiver and manipulator, they were very simple. At the two\r\nstations the wire was wound round a magnet, that is to say, round a\r\npiece of soft iron surrounded with a wire. The communication was thus\r\nestablished between the two poles; the current, starting from the\r\npositive pole, traversed the wire, passed through the magnet which was\r\ntemporarily magnetized, and returned through the earth to the negative\r\npole. If the current was interrupted, the magnet immediately became\r\nunmagnetized. It was sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the\r\nmagnet, which, attracted during the passage of the current, would fall\r\nback when the current was interrupted. This movement of the plate thus\r\nobtained, Harding could easily fasten to it a needle arranged on a dial,\r\nbearing the letters of the alphabet, and in this way communicate from\r\none station to the other.\r\n\r\nAll was completely arranged by the 12th of February. On this day,\r\nHarding, having sent the current through the wire, asked if all\r\nwas going on well at the corral, and received in a few moments a\r\nsatisfactory reply from Ayrton. Pencroft was wild with joy, and every\r\nmorning and evening he sent a telegram to the corral, which always\r\nreceived an answer.\r\n\r\nThis mode of communication presented two very real advantages: firstly,\r\nbecause it enabled them to ascertain that Ayrton was at the corral; and\r\nsecondly, that he was thus not left completely isolated. Besides, Cyrus\r\nHarding never allowed a week to pass without going to see him, and\r\nAyrton came from time to time to Granite House, where he always found a\r\ncordial welcome.\r\n\r\nThe fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work. The\r\nresources of the colony, particularly in vegetables and corn, increased\r\nfrom day to day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island had succeeded\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nThe plateau of Prospect Heights presented an encouraging aspect. The\r\nfourth harvest had been admirable and it may be supposed that no one\r\nthought of counting whether the four hundred thousand millions of grains\r\nduly appeared in the crop. However, Pencroft had thought of doing so,\r\nbut Cyrus Harding having told him that even if he managed to count three\r\nhundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an hour, it would take him\r\nnearly five thousand five-hundred years to finish his task, the honest\r\nsailor considered it best to give up the idea.\r\n\r\nThe weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day time, but\r\nin the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and\r\nprocured cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite House. There were,\r\nhowever, a few storms, which, although they were not of long duration,\r\nswept over Lincoln Island with extraordinary fury. The lightning blazed\r\nand the thunder continued to roll for some hours.\r\n\r\nAt this period the little colony was extremely prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe tenants of the poultry-yard swarmed, and they lived on the surplus,\r\nbut it became necessary to reduce the population to a more moderate\r\nnumber. The pigs had already produced young, and it may be understood\r\nthat their care for these animals absorbed a great part of Neb and\r\nPencroft’s time. The onagers, who had two pretty colts, were most often\r\nmounted by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, who had become an excellent rider\r\nunder the reporter’s instruction, and they also harnessed them to the\r\ncart either for carrying wood and coal to Granite House, or different\r\nmineral productions required by the engineer.\r\n\r\nSeveral expeditions were made about this time into the depths of the Far\r\nWest Forests. The explorers could venture there without having anything\r\nto fear from the heat, for the sun’s rays scarcely penetrated through\r\nthe thick foliage spreading above their heads. They thus visited all the\r\nleft bank of the Mercy, along which ran the road from the corral to the\r\nmouth of Falls River.\r\n\r\nBut in these excursions the settlers took care to be well armed, for\r\nthey met with savage wild boars, with which they often had a tussle.\r\nThey also, during this season, made fierce war against the jaguars.\r\nGideon Spilett had vowed a special hatred against them, and his pupil\r\nHerbert seconded him well. Armed as they were, they no longer feared\r\nto meet one of those beasts. Herbert’s courage was superb, and the\r\nreporter’s sang-froid astonishing. Already twenty magnificent skins\r\nornamented the dining-room of Granite House, and if this continued, the\r\njaguar race would soon be extinct in the island, the object aimed at by\r\nthe hunters.\r\n\r\nThe engineer sometimes took part in the expeditions made to the unknown\r\nparts of the island, which he surveyed with great attention. It was for\r\nother traces than those of animals that he searched the thickets of the\r\nvast forest, but nothing suspicious ever appeared. Neither Top nor Jup,\r\nwho accompanied him, ever betrayed by their behavior that there was\r\nanything strange there, and yet more than once again the dog barked at\r\nthe mouth of the well, which the engineer had before explored without\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAt this time Gideon Spilett, aided by Herbert, took several views of\r\nthe most picturesque parts of the island, by means of the photographic\r\napparatus found in the cases, and of which they had not as yet made any\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, provided with a powerful object-glass, was very\r\ncomplete. Substances necessary for the photographic reproduction,\r\ncollodion for preparing the glass plate, nitrate of silver to render it\r\nsensitive, hyposulfate of soda to fix the prints obtained, chloride of\r\nammonium in which to soak the paper destined to give the positive proof,\r\nacetate of soda and chloride of gold in which to immerse the paper,\r\nnothing was wanting. Even the papers were there, all prepared,\r\nand before laying in the printing-frame upon the negatives, it was\r\nsufficient to soak them for a few minutes in the solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThe reporter and his assistant became in a short time very skilful\r\noperators, and they obtained fine views of the country, such as the\r\nisland, taken from Prospect Heights with Mount Franklin in the distance,\r\nthe mouth of the Mercy, so picturesquely framed in high rocks, the glade\r\nand the corral, with the spurs of the mountain in the background, the\r\ncurious development of Claw Cape, Flotsam Point, etc.\r\n\r\nNor did the photographers forget to take the portraits of all the\r\ninhabitants of the island, leaving out no one.\r\n\r\n“It multiplies us,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor was enchanted to see his own countenance, faithfully\r\nreproduced, ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stopped\r\nas willingly before this exhibition as he would have done before the\r\nrichest shop-windows in Broadway.\r\n\r\nBut it must be acknowledged that the most successful portrait was\r\nincontestably that of Master Jup. Master Jup had sat with a gravity not\r\nto be described, and his portrait was lifelike!\r\n\r\n“He looks as if he was just going to grin!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAnd if Master Jup had not been satisfied, he would have been very\r\ndifficult to please; but he was quite contented and contemplated his own\r\ncountenance with a sentimental air which expressed some small amount of\r\nconceit.\r\n\r\nThe summer heat ended with the month of March. The weather was sometimes\r\nrainy, but still warm. The month of March, which corresponds to the\r\nSeptember of northern latitudes, was not so fine as might have been\r\nhoped. Perhaps it announced an early and rigorous winter.\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed one morning--the 21 st--that the first snow\r\nhad already made its appearance. In fact Herbert looking early from one\r\nof the windows of Granite House, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Hallo! the islet is covered with snow!”\r\n\r\n“Snow at this time?” answered the reporter, joining the boy.\r\n\r\nTheir companions were soon beside them, but could only ascertain one\r\nthing, that not only the islet but all the beach below Granite House was\r\ncovered with one uniform sheet of white.\r\n\r\n“It must be snow!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Or rather it’s very like it!” replied Neb.\r\n\r\n“But the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees!” observed Gideon\r\nSpilett.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying anything, for\r\nhe really did not know how to explain this phenomenon, at this time of\r\nyear and in such a temperature.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” exclaimed Pencroft, “all our plants will be frozen!”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the nimble\r\nJup, who slid down to the sand.\r\n\r\nBut the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet arose and\r\ndispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the\r\nsun was obscured for some minutes.\r\n\r\n“Birds!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\nThey were indeed swarms of sea-birds, with dazzling white plumage.\r\nThey had perched by thousands on the islet and on the shore, and they\r\ndisappeared in the distance, leaving the colonists amazed as if they\r\nhad been present at some transformation scene, in which summer succeeded\r\nwinter at the touch of a fairy’s wand. Unfortunately the change had been\r\nso sudden, that neither the reporter nor the lad had been able to bring\r\ndown one of these birds, of which they could not recognize the species.\r\n\r\nA few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two years\r\nbefore, the castaways from the air had been thrown upon Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19\r\n\r\nTwo years already! and for two years the colonists had had no\r\ncommunication with their fellow-creatures! They were without news from\r\nthe civilized world, lost on this island, as completely as if they had\r\nbeen on the most minute star of the celestial hemisphere!\r\n\r\nWhat was now happening in their country? The picture of their native\r\nland was always before their eyes, the land torn by civil war at the\r\ntime they left it, and which the Southern rebellion was perhaps still\r\nstaining with blood! It was a great sorrow to them, and they often\r\ntalked together of these things, without ever doubting however that\r\nthe cause of the North must triumph, for the honor of the American\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the island;\r\nor, at least, not a sail had been seen. It was evident that Lincoln\r\nIsland was out of the usual track, and also that it was unknown,--as was\r\nbesides proved by the maps,--for though there was no port, vessels might\r\nhave visited it for the purpose of renewing their store of water. But\r\nthe surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could reach, and\r\nthe colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land.\r\n\r\nHowever, one chance of rescue existed, and this chance was discussed\r\none day on the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered\r\ntogether in the dining-room of Granite House.\r\n\r\nThey had been talking of America, of their native country, which they\r\nhad so little hope of ever seeing again.\r\n\r\n“Decidedly we have only one way,” said Spilett, “one single way for\r\nleaving Lincoln Island, and that is, to build a vessel large enough to\r\nsail several hundred miles. It appears to me, that when one has built a\r\nboat it is just as easy to build a ship!”\r\n\r\n“And in which we might go to the Pomoutous,” added Herbert, “just as\r\neasily as we went to Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“I do not say no,” replied Pencroft, who had always the casting vote\r\nin maritime questions; “I do not say no, although it is not exactly the\r\nsame thing to make a long as a short voyage! If our little craft had\r\nbeen caught in any heavy gale of wind during the voyage to Tabor Island,\r\nwe should have known that land was at no great distance either way; but\r\ntwelve hundred miles is a pretty long way, and the nearest land is at\r\nleast that distance!”\r\n\r\n“Would you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?” asked\r\nthe reporter.\r\n\r\n“I will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett,” answered the\r\nsailor, “and you know well that I am not a man to flinch!”\r\n\r\n“Remember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us now,”\r\n remarked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Who is that?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton.”\r\n\r\n“If he will consent to come,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” returned the reporter; “do you think that if Lord\r\nGlenarvan’s yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still\r\nliving there, Ayrton would have refused to depart?”\r\n\r\n“You forget, my friends,” then said Cyrus Harding, “that Ayrton was not\r\nin possession of his reason during the last years of his stay there. But\r\nthat is not the question. The point is to know if we may count among\r\nour chances of being rescued, the return of the Scotch vessel. Now,\r\nLord Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would return to take him off from\r\nTabor Island when he considered that his crimes were expiated, and I\r\nbelieve that he will return.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the reporter, “and I will add that he will return soon, for\r\nit is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” answered Pencroft, “I agree with you that the nobleman will\r\nreturn, and soon too. But where will he touch? At Tabor Island, and not\r\nat Lincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“That is the more certain,” replied Herbert, “as Lincoln Island is not\r\neven marked on the map.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore, my friends,” said the engineer, “we ought to take the\r\nnecessary precautions for making our presence and that of Ayrton on\r\nLincoln Island known at Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered the reporter, “and nothing is easier than to place\r\nin the hut, which was Captain Grant’s and Ayrton’s dwelling, a notice\r\nwhich Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help finding, giving the\r\nposition of our island.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pity,” remarked the sailor, “that we forgot to take that\r\nprecaution on our first visit to Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“And why should we have done it?” asked Herbert. “At that time we did\r\nnot know Ayrton’s history; we did not know that any one was likely to\r\ncome some day to fetch him, and when we did know his history, the season\r\nwas too advanced to allow us to return then to Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Harding, “it was too late, and we must put off the voyage\r\nuntil next spring.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“That is not probable,” replied the engineer, “for Lord Glenarvan would\r\nnot choose the winter season to venture into these seas. Either he has\r\nalready returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton has been with us, that is\r\nto say, during the last five months and has left again; or he will not\r\ncome till later, and it will be time enough in the first fine October\r\ndays to go to Tabor Island, and leave a notice there.”\r\n\r\n“We must allow,” said Neb, “that it will be very unfortunate if the\r\n‘Duncan’ has returned to these parts only a few months ago!”\r\n\r\n“I hope that it is not so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and that Heaven has\r\nnot deprived us of the best chance which remains to us.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” observed the reporter, “that at any rate we shall know what\r\nwe have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island, for if the yacht\r\nhas returned there, they will necessarily have left some traces of their\r\nvisit.”\r\n\r\n“That is evident,” answered the engineer. “So then, my friends, since\r\nwe have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait patiently,\r\nand if it is taken from us we shall see what will be best to do.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” remarked Pencroft, “it is well understood that if we\r\ndo leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were uncomfortable\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “it will be because we are far\r\nfrom all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his friends,\r\nhis native land!”\r\n\r\nMatters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large enough to\r\nsail either to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New Zealand in\r\nthe west, was no longer talked of, and they busied themselves in their\r\naccustomed occupations, with a view to wintering a third time in Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on, their\r\nlittle vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the island.\r\nA complete survey of the coast had not yet been made, and the colonists\r\nhad but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north, from the\r\nmouth of Falls River to the Mandible Capes, as well as of the narrow bay\r\nbetween them, which opened like a shark’s jaws.\r\n\r\nThe plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus Harding\r\nfully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this part of his\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nThe weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by sudden\r\nmovements, and they could therefore count on tolerable weather. However,\r\nduring the first week of April, after a sudden barometrical fall, a\r\nrenewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of wind, lasting five or six\r\ndays; then the needle of the instrument remained stationary at a\r\nheight of twenty-nine inches and nine-tenths, and the weather appeared\r\npropitious for an excursion.\r\n\r\nThe departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the “Bonadventure,”\r\n anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a voyage which might be of\r\nsome duration.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and proposed\r\nthat he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to remain on\r\nshore, it was decided that he should come to Granite House during the\r\nabsence of his companions. Master Jup was ordered to keep him company,\r\nand made no remonstrance.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th of April all the colonists, including Top,\r\nembarked. A fine breeze blew from the south-west, and the “Bonadventure”\r\n tacked on leaving Port Balloon so as to reach Reptile End. Of the ninety\r\nmiles which the perimeter of the island measured, twenty included the\r\nsouth coast between the port and the promontory. The wind being right\r\nahead it was necessary to hug the shore.\r\n\r\nIt took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on leaving\r\nport had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for\r\nsix hours against the flood. It was nightfall before the promontory was\r\ndoubled.\r\n\r\nThe sailor then proposed to the engineer that they should continue\r\nsailing slowly with two reefs in the sail. But Harding preferred to\r\nanchor a few cable-lengths from the shore, so as to survey that part of\r\nthe coast during the day. It was agreed also that as they were anxious\r\nfor a minute exploration of the coast they should not sail during the\r\nnight, but would always, when the weather permitted it, be at anchor\r\nnear the shore.\r\n\r\nThe night was passed under the promontory, and the wind having fallen,\r\nnothing disturbed the silence. The passengers, with the exception of the\r\nsailor, scarcely slept as well on board the “Bonadventure” as they would\r\nhave done in their rooms at Granite House, but they did sleep however.\r\nPencroft set sail at break of day, and by going on the larboard tack\r\nthey could keep close to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast, since they had already\r\nexplored it on foot, and yet it again excited their admiration. They\r\ncoasted along as close in as possible, so as to notice everything,\r\navoiding always the trunks of trees which floated here and there.\r\nSeveral times also they anchored, and Gideon Spilett took photographs of\r\nthe superb scenery.\r\n\r\nAbout noon the “Bonadventure” arrived at the mouth of Falls River.\r\nBeyond, on the left bank, a few scattered trees appeared, and three\r\nmiles further even these dwindled into solitary groups among the western\r\nspurs of the mountain, whose arid ridge sloped down to the shore.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast between the northern and southern part of the coast!\r\nIn proportion as one was woody and fertile so was the other rugged and\r\nbarren! It might have been designated as one of those iron coasts, as\r\nthey are called in some countries, and its wild confusion appeared to\r\nindicate that a sudden crystallization had been produced in the yet\r\nliquid basalt of some distant geological sea. These stupendous masses\r\nwould have terrified the settlers if they had been cast at first on\r\nthis part of the island! They had not been able to perceive the sinister\r\naspect of this shore from the summit of Mount Franklin, for they\r\noverlooked it from too great a height, but viewed from the sea it\r\npresented a wild appearance which could not perhaps be equaled in any\r\ncorner of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe “Bonadventure” sailed along this coast for the distance of half a\r\nmile. It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes,\r\nfrom twenty to three hundred feet in height, and of all shapes, round\r\nlike towers, prismatic like steeples, pyramidal like obelisks, conical\r\nlike factory chimneys. An iceberg of the Polar seas could not have been\r\nmore capricious in its terrible sublimity! Here, bridges were thrown\r\nfrom one rock to another; there, arches like those of a wave, into the\r\ndepths of which the eye could not penetrate; in one place, large vaulted\r\nexcavations presented a monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of\r\ncolumns, spires, and arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever\r\npossessed. Every caprice of nature, still more varied than those of the\r\nimagination, appeared on this grand coast, which extended over a length\r\nof eight or nine miles.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions gazed, with a feeling of surprise\r\nbordering on stupefaction. But, although they remained silent, Top,\r\nnot being troubled with feelings of this sort, uttered barks which were\r\nrepeated by the thousand echoes of the basaltic cliff. The engineer\r\neven observed that these barks had something strange in them, like those\r\nwhich the dog had uttered at the mouth of the well in Granite House.\r\n\r\n“Let us go close in,” said he.\r\n\r\nAnd the “Bonadventure” sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore.\r\nPerhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed\r\nthere? But Harding saw nothing, not a cavern, not a cleft which could\r\nserve as a retreat to any being whatever, for the foot of the cliff was\r\nwashed by the surf. Soon Top’s barks ceased, and the vessel continued\r\nher course at a few cables-length from the coast.\r\n\r\nIn the northwest part of the island the shore became again flat and\r\nsandy. A few trees here and there rose above a low, marshy ground, which\r\nthe colonists had already surveyed, and in violent contrast to the other\r\ndesert shore, life was again manifested by the presence of myriads of\r\nwater-fowl. That evening the “Bonadventure” anchored in a small bay\r\nto the north of the island, near the land, such was the depth of water\r\nthere. The night passed quietly, for the breeze died away with the last\r\nlight of day, and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn.\r\n\r\nAs it was easy to land, the usual hunters of the colony, that is to say,\r\nHerbert and Gideon Spilett, went for a ramble of two hours or so, and\r\nreturned with several strings of wild duck and snipe. Top had\r\ndone wonders, and not a bird had been lost, thanks to his zeal and\r\ncleverness.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock in the morning the “Bonadventure” set sail, and ran\r\nrapidly towards North Mandible Cape, for the wind was right astern and\r\nfreshening rapidly.\r\n\r\n“However,” observed Pencroft, “I should not be surprised if a gale came\r\nup from the west. Yesterday the sun set in a very red-looking horizon,\r\nand now, this morning, those mares-tails don’t forbode anything good.”\r\n\r\nThese mares-tails are cirrus clouds, scattered in the zenith, their\r\nheight from the sea being less than five thousand feet. They look like\r\nlight pieces of cotton wool, and their presence usually announces some\r\nsudden change in the weather.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Harding, “let us carry as much sail as possible, and run\r\nfor shelter into Shark Gulf. I think that the ‘Bonadventure’ will be\r\nsafe there.”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” replied Pencroft, “and besides, the north coast is merely\r\nsand, very uninteresting to look at.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not be sorry,” resumed the engineer, “to pass not only to-night\r\nbut to-morrow in that bay, which is worth being carefully explored.”\r\n\r\n“I think that we shall be obliged to do so, whether we like it or not,”\r\n answered Pencroft, “for the sky looks very threatening towards the west.\r\nDirty weather is coming on!”\r\n\r\n“At any rate we have a favorable wind for reaching Cape Mandible,”\r\n observed the reporter.\r\n\r\n“A very fine wind,” replied the sailor; “but we must tack to enter the\r\ngulf, and I should like to see my way clear in these unknown quarters.”\r\n\r\n“Quarters which appear to be filled with rocks,” added Herbert, “if we\r\njudge by what we saw on the south coast of Shark Gulf.”\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” said Cyrus Harding, “do as you think best, we will leave it\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t make your mind uneasy, captain,” replied the sailor, “I shall not\r\nexpose myself needlessly! I would rather a knife were run into my ribs\r\nthan a sharp rock into those of my ‘Bonadventure!’”\r\n\r\nThat which Pencroft called ribs was the part of his vessel under water,\r\nand he valued it more than his own skin.\r\n\r\n“What o’clock is it?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Ten o’clock,” replied Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“And what distance is it to the Cape, captain?”\r\n\r\n“About fifteen miles,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“That’s a matter of two hours and a half,” said the sailor, “and we\r\nshall be off the Cape between twelve and one o’clock. Unluckily, the\r\ntide will be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of the gulf.\r\nI am afraid that it will be very difficult to get in, having both wind\r\nand tide against us.”\r\n\r\n“And the more so that it is a full moon to-day,” remarked Herbert, “and\r\nthese April tides are very strong.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Pencroft,” asked Harding, “can you not anchor off the Cape?”\r\n\r\n“Anchor near land, with bad weather coming on!” exclaimed the sailor.\r\n“What are you thinking of, captain? We should run aground, of a\r\ncertainty!”\r\n\r\n“What will you do then?”\r\n\r\n“I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to say, till\r\nabout seven in the evening, and if there is still light enough I will\r\ntry to enter the gulf; if not, we must stand off and on during the\r\nnight, and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise.”\r\n\r\n“As I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you,” answered Harding.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Pencroft, “if there was only a lighthouse on the coast, it\r\nwould be much more convenient for sailors.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Herbert, “and this time we shall have no obliging\r\nengineer to light a fire to guide us into port!”\r\n\r\n“Why, indeed, my dear Cyrus,” said Spilett, “we have never thanked you;\r\nbut frankly, without that fire we should never have been able--”\r\n\r\n“A fire?” asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter’s words.\r\n\r\n“We mean, captain,” answered Pencroft, “that on board the ‘Bonadventure’\r\nwe were very anxious during the few hours before our return, and we\r\nshould have passed to windward of the island, if it had not been for the\r\nprecaution you took of lighting a fire the night of the 19th of October,\r\non Prospect Heights.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes! That was a lucky idea of mine!” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“And this time,” continued the sailor, “unless the idea occurs to\r\nAyrton, there will be no one to do us that little service!”\r\n\r\n“No! No one!” answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after, finding himself alone in the bows of the vessel,\r\nwith the reporter, the engineer bent down and whispered,--\r\n\r\n“If there is one thing certain in this world, Spilett, it is that I\r\nnever lighted any fire during the night of the 19th of October, neither\r\non Prospect Heights nor on any other part of the island!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20\r\n\r\nThings happened as Pencroft had predicted, he being seldom mistaken in\r\nhis prognostications. The wind rose, and from a fresh breeze it soon\r\nincreased to a regular gale; that is to say, it acquired a speed of from\r\nforty to forty-five miles an hour, before which a ship in the open sea\r\nwould have run under close-reefed topsails. Now, as it was nearly six\r\no’clock when the “Bonadventure” reached the gulf, and as at that\r\nmoment the tide turned, it was impossible to enter. They were therefore\r\ncompelled to stand off, for even if he had wished to do so, Pencroft\r\ncould not have gained the mouth of the Mercy. Hoisting the jib to the\r\nmainmast by way of a storm-sail, he hove to, putting the head of the\r\nvessel towards the land.\r\n\r\nFortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being sheltered by\r\nthe land, did not run very high. They had then little to fear from\r\nthe waves, which always endanger small craft. The “Bonadventure” would\r\ndoubtlessly not have capsized, for she was well ballasted, but enormous\r\nmasses of water falling on the deck might injure her if her timbers\r\ncould not sustain them. Pencroft, as a good sailor, was prepared\r\nfor anything. Certainly, he had great confidence in his vessel, but\r\nnevertheless he awaited the return of day with some anxiety.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett had no opportunity\r\nfor talking together, and yet the words pronounced in the reporter’s\r\near by the engineer were well worth being discussed, together with the\r\nmysterious influence which appeared to reign over Lincoln Island. Gideon\r\nSpilett did not cease from pondering over this new and inexplicable\r\nincident, the appearance of a fire on the coast of the island. The fire\r\nhad actually been seen! His companions, Herbert and Pencroft, had seen\r\nit with him! The fire had served to signalize the position of the island\r\nduring that dark night, and they had not doubted that it was lighted by\r\nthe engineer’s hand; and here was Cyrus Harding expressly declaring that\r\nhe had never done anything of the sort! Spilett resolved to recur to\r\nthis incident as soon as the “Bonadventure” returned, and to urge Cyrus\r\nHarding to acquaint their companions with these strange facts. Perhaps\r\nit would be decided to make in common a complete investigation of every\r\npart of Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nHowever that might be, on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet\r\nunknown shores, which formed the entrance to the gulf, and the little\r\nvessel stood off during the night.\r\n\r\nWhen the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon, the\r\nwind, which had slightly fallen, shifted two points, and enabled\r\nPencroft to enter the narrow gulf with greater ease. Towards seven\r\no’clock in the morning, the “Bonadventure,” weathering the North\r\nMandible Cape, entered the strait and glided on to the waters, so\r\nstrangely enclosed in the frame of lava.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroft, “this bay would make admirable roads, in which a\r\nwhole fleet could lie at their ease!”\r\n\r\n“What is especially curious,” observed Harding, “is that the gulf\r\nhas been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the volcano, and\r\naccumulated by successive eruptions. The result is that the gulf is\r\ncompletely sheltered on all sides, and I believe that even in the\r\nstormiest weather, the sea here must be as calm as a lake.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” returned the sailor, “since the wind has only that narrow\r\nentrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides, the north\r\ncape protects that of the south in a way which would make the entrance\r\nof gusts very difficult. I declare our ‘Bonadventure’ could stay here\r\nfrom one end of the year to the other, without even dragging at her\r\nanchor!”\r\n\r\n“It is rather large for her!” observed the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Well! Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “I agree that it is too large\r\nfor the ‘Bonadventure,’ but if the fleets of the Union were in want of a\r\nharbor in the Pacific, I don’t think they would ever find a better place\r\nthan this!”\r\n\r\n“We are in the shark’s mouth,” remarked Neb, alluding to the form of the\r\ngulf.\r\n\r\n“Right into its mouth, my honest Neb!” replied Herbert, “but you are not\r\nafraid that it will shut upon us, are you?”\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Herbert,” answered Neb, “and yet this gulf here doesn’t please\r\nme much! It has a wicked look!”\r\n\r\n“Hallo!” cried Pencroft, “here is Neb turning up his nose at my gulf,\r\njust as I was thinking of presenting it to America!”\r\n\r\n“But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?” asked the engineer, “for a\r\ndepth sufficient for the keel of the ‘Bonadventure’ would not be enough\r\nfor those of our iron-clads.”\r\n\r\n“That is easily found out,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a\r\nlead-line, and to which was fastened a lump of iron. This cord measured\r\nnearly fifty fathoms, and its entire length was unrolled without finding\r\nany bottom.\r\n\r\n“There,” exclaimed Pencroft, “our iron-clads can come here after all!\r\nThey would not run aground!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Gideon Spilett, “this gulf is a regular abyss, but,\r\ntaking into consideration the volcanic origin of the island, it is not\r\nastonishing that the sea should offer similar depressions.”\r\n\r\n“One would say too,” observed Herbert, “that these cliffs were perfectly\r\nperpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even with a line five\r\nor six times longer, Pencroft would not find bottom.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very well,” then said the reporter, “but I must point out\r\nto Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very important respect!”\r\n\r\n“And what is that, Mr. Spilett?”\r\n\r\n“An opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the interior of\r\nthe island. I do not see a spot on which we could land.” And, in\r\nfact, the steep lava cliffs did not afford a single place suitable for\r\nlanding. They formed an insuperable barrier, recalling, but with more\r\nwildness, the fiords of Norway. The “Bonadventure,” coasting as close\r\nas possible along the cliffs, did not discover even a projection which\r\nwould allow the passengers to leave the deck.\r\n\r\nPencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they\r\ncould soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and then, as\r\nthere was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf, he steered his\r\nvessel towards the strait and passed out at about two o’clock in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Neb, uttering a sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOne might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his ease in\r\nthose enormous jaws.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was not more\r\nthan eight miles. The head of the “Bonadventure” was put towards Granite\r\nHouse, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran rapidly along the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nTo the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand dunes,\r\namong which the engineer had been so singularly recovered, and which\r\nseabirds frequented in thousands.\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on his\r\nleft, entered the channel which separated it from the coast, and at five\r\no’clock the anchor of the “Bonadventure” was buried in the sand at the\r\nmouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nThe colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling. Ayrton\r\nwas waiting for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to meet them,\r\ngiving vent to deep grunts of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nA complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been made,\r\nand no suspicious appearances had been observed. If any mysterious being\r\nresided on it, it could only be under cover of the impenetrable forest\r\nof the Serpentine Peninsula, to which the colonists had not yet directed\r\ntheir investigations.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it was\r\nagreed that they should direct the attention of their companions to the\r\nstrange character of certain incidents which had occurred on the island,\r\nand of which the last was the most unaccountable.\r\n\r\nHowever, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been kindled on\r\nthe shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from repeating for the\r\ntwentieth time to the reporter,--\r\n\r\n“But are you quite sure of having seen it? Was it not a partial eruption\r\nof the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?”\r\n\r\n“No, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “it was certainly a fire lighted by\r\nthe hand of man. Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert. They saw it as\r\nI saw it myself, and they will confirm my words.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of April, in\r\nthe evening, when the settlers were all collected on Prospect Heights,\r\nCyrus Harding began by saying,--\r\n\r\n“My friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to certain\r\nincidents which have occurred in the island, on the subject of which I\r\nshall be happy to have your advice. These incidents are, so to speak,\r\nsupernatural--”\r\n\r\n“Supernatural!” exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke from\r\nhis mouth. “Can it be possible that our island is supernatural?”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly,” replied the engineer;\r\n“unless you can explain that which Spilett and I have until now failed\r\nto understand.”\r\n\r\n“Speak away, captain,” answered the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Well, have you understood,” then said the engineer, “how was it that\r\nafter falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile into the\r\ninterior of the island, and that, without my having any consciousness of\r\nmy removal there?”\r\n\r\n“Unless, being unconscious--” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“That is not admissible,” replied the engineer. “But to continue. Have\r\nyou understood how Top was able to discover your retreat five miles from\r\nthe cave in which I was lying?”\r\n\r\n“The dog’s instinct--” observed Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Singular instinct!” returned the reporter, “since notwithstanding the\r\nstorm of rain and wind which was raging during that night, Top arrived\r\nat the Chimneys, dry and without a speck of mud!”\r\n\r\n“Let us continue,” resumed the engineer. “Have you understood how our\r\ndog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his\r\nstruggle with the dugong?”\r\n\r\n“No! I confess, not at all,” replied Pencroft, “and the wound which the\r\ndugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been made with a\r\nsharp instrument; that can’t be understood, either.”\r\n\r\n“Let us continue again,” said Harding. “Have you understood, my friends,\r\nhow that bullet got into the body of the young peccary; how that case\r\nhappened to be so fortunately stranded, without there being any trace\r\nof a wreck; how that bottle containing the document presented itself\r\nso opportunely, during our first sea-excursion; how our canoe, having\r\nbroken its moorings, floated down the current of the Mercy and rejoined\r\nus at the very moment we needed it; how after the ape invasion the\r\nladder was so obligingly thrown down from Granite House; and lastly, how\r\nthe document, which Ayrton asserts was never written by him, fell into\r\nour hands?”\r\n\r\nAs Cyrus Harding thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the singular\r\nincidents which had occurred in the island, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft\r\nstared at each other, not knowing what to reply, for this succession of\r\nincidents, grouped thus for the first time, could not but excite their\r\nsurprise to the highest degree.\r\n\r\n“‘Pon my word,” said Pencroft at last, “you are right, captain, and it\r\nis difficult to explain all these things!”\r\n\r\n“Well, my friends,” resumed the engineer, “a last fact has just been\r\nadded to these, and it is no less incomprehensible than the others!”\r\n\r\n“What is it, captain?” asked Herbert quickly.\r\n\r\n“When you were returning from Tabor Island, Pencroft,” continued the\r\nengineer, “you said that a fire appeared on Lincoln Island?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered the sailor.\r\n\r\n“And you are quite certain of having seen this fire?”\r\n\r\n“As sure as I see you now.”\r\n\r\n“You also, Herbert?”\r\n\r\n“Why, captain,” cried Herbert, “that fire was blazing like a star of the\r\nfirst magnitude!”\r\n\r\n“But was it not a star?” urged the engineer.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Pencroft, “for the sky was covered with thick clouds, and\r\nat any rate a star would not have been so low on the horizon. But Mr.\r\nSpilett saw it as well as we, and he will confirm our words.”\r\n\r\n“I will add,” said the reporter, “that the fire was very bright, and\r\nthat it shot up like a sheet of lightning.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes! exactly,” added Herbert, “and it was certainly placed on the\r\nheights of Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my friends,” replied Cyrus Harding, “during the night of the 19th\r\nof October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the coast.”\r\n\r\n“You did not!” exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his astonishment,\r\nnot being able to finish his sentence.\r\n\r\n“We did not leave Granite House,” answered Cyrus Harding, “and if a fire\r\nappeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand than ours!”\r\n\r\nPencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied. No illusion could be\r\npossible, and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the\r\n19th of October. Yes! they had to acknowledge it, a mystery existed! An\r\ninexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the colonists, but very\r\nirritating to their curiosity, was executed always in the nick of time\r\non Lincoln Island. Could there be some being hidden in its profoundest\r\nrecesses? It was necessary at any cost to ascertain this.\r\n\r\nHarding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of Top and\r\nJup when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which placed Granite\r\nHouse in communication with the sea, and he told them that he had\r\nexplored the well, without discovering anything suspicious. The final\r\nresolve taken, in consequence of this conversation, by all the members\r\nof the colony, was that as soon as the fine season returned they would\r\nthoroughly search the whole of the island.\r\n\r\nBut from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious. He felt as if the\r\nisland which he had made his own personal property belonged to him\r\nentirely no longer, and that he shared it with another master, to\r\nwhom, willing or not, he felt subject. Neb and he often talked of those\r\nunaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining them to the\r\nmarvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln Island was under the\r\ndominion of some supernatural power.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May, the\r\nNovember of the northern zones. It appeared that the winter would\r\nbe severe and forward. The preparations for the winter season were\r\ntherefore commenced without delay.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the colonists were well prepared to meet the winter,\r\nhowever hard it might be. They had plenty of felt clothing, and the\r\nmusmons, very numerous by this time, had furnished an abundance of wool\r\nnecessary for the manufacture of this warm material.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that Ayrton had been provided with this\r\ncomfortable clothing. Cyrus Harding proposed that he should come to\r\nspend the bad season with them in Granite House, where he would be\r\nbetter lodged than at the corral, and Ayrton promised to do so, as soon\r\nas the last work at the corral was finished. He did this towards the\r\nmiddle of April. From that time Ayrton shared the common life, and made\r\nhimself useful on all occasions; but still humble and sad, he never took\r\npart in the pleasures of his companions.\r\n\r\nFor the greater part of this, the third winter which the settlers passed\r\nin Lincoln Island, they were confined to Granite House. There were many\r\nviolent storms and frightful tempests, which appeared to shake the rocks\r\nto their very foundations. Immense waves threatened to overwhelm the\r\nisland, and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have\r\nbeen dashed to pieces. Twice, during one of these hurricanes, the Mercy\r\nswelled to such a degree as to give reason to fear that the bridges\r\nwould be swept away, and it was necessary to strengthen those on the\r\nshore, which disappeared under the foaming waters, when the sea beat\r\nagainst the beach.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that such storms, comparable to water-spouts in\r\nwhich were mingled rain and snow, would cause great havoc on the\r\nplateau of Prospect Heights. The mill and the poultry-yard particularly\r\nsuffered. The colonists were often obliged to make immediate repairs,\r\nwithout which the safety of the birds would have been seriously\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nDuring the worst weather, several jaguars and troops of quadrumana\r\nventured to the edge of the plateau, and it was always to be feared that\r\nthe most active and audacious would, urged by hunger, manage to cross\r\nthe stream, which besides, when frozen, offered them an easy passage.\r\nPlantations and domestic animals would then have been infallibly\r\ndestroyed, without a constant watch, and it was often necessary to\r\nmake use of the guns to keep those dangerous visitors at a respectful\r\ndistance. Occupation was not wanting to the colonists, for without\r\nreckoning their out-door cares, they had always a thousand plans for the\r\nfitting up of Granite House.\r\n\r\nThey had also some fine sporting excursions, which were made during the\r\nfrost in the vast Tadorn Marsh. Gideon Spilett and Herbert, aided by\r\nJup and Top, did not miss a shot in the midst of myriads of wild-duck,\r\nsnipe, teal, and others. The access to these hunting-grounds was easy;\r\nbesides, whether they reached them by the road to Port Balloon, after\r\nhaving passed the Mercy Bridge, or by turning the rocks from Flotsam\r\nPoint, the hunters were never distant from Granite House more than two\r\nor three miles.\r\n\r\nThus passed the four winter months, which were really rigorous, that is\r\nto say, June, July, August, and September. But, in short, Granite House\r\ndid not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather, and it was\r\nthe same with the corral, which, less exposed than the plateau, and\r\nsheltered partly by Mount Franklin, only received the remains of the\r\nhurricanes, already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the\r\nshore. The damages there were consequently of small importance, and the\r\nactivity and skill of Ayrton promptly repaired them, when some time in\r\nOctober he returned to pass a few days in the corral.\r\n\r\nDuring this winter, no fresh inexplicable incident occurred. Nothing\r\nstrange happened, although Pencroft and Neb were on the watch for the\r\nmost insignificant facts to which they attached any mysterious cause.\r\nTop and Jup themselves no longer growled round the well or gave any\r\nsigns of uneasiness. It appeared, therefore, as if the series of\r\nsupernatural incidents was interrupted, although they often talked of\r\nthem during the evenings in Granite House, and they remained thoroughly\r\nresolved that the island should be searched, even in those parts the\r\nmost difficult to explore. But an event of the highest importance, and\r\nof which the consequences might be terrible, momentarily diverted from\r\ntheir projects Cyrus Harding and his companions.\r\n\r\nIt was the month of October. The fine season was swiftly returning.\r\nNature was reviving; and among the evergreen foliage of the coniferae\r\nwhich formed the border of the wood, already appeared the young leaves\r\nof the banksias, deodars, and other trees.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that Gideon Spilett and Herbert had, at different\r\ntimes, taken photographic views of Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nNow, on the 17th of this month of October, towards three o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon, Herbert, enticed by the charms of the sky, thought of\r\nreproducing Union Bay, which was opposite to Prospect Heights, from Cape\r\nMandible to Claw Cape.\r\n\r\nThe horizon was beautifully clear, and the sea, undulating under a soft\r\nbreeze, was as calm as the waters of a lake, sparkling here and there\r\nunder the sun’s rays.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining-room\r\nat Granite House, and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay.\r\nHerbert proceeded as he was accustomed to do, and the negative obtained,\r\nhe went away to fix it by means of the chemicals deposited in a dark\r\nnook of Granite House.\r\n\r\nReturning to the bright light, and examining it well, Herbert perceived\r\non his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon.\r\nHe endeavored to make it disappear by reiterated washing, but could not\r\naccomplish it.\r\n\r\n“It is a flaw in the glass,” he thought.\r\n\r\nAnd then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong\r\nmagnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes.\r\n\r\nBut he had scarcely looked at it, when he uttered a cry, and the glass\r\nalmost fell from his hands.\r\n\r\nImmediately running to the room in which Cyrus Harding then was, he\r\nextended the negative and magnifier towards the engineer, pointing out\r\nthe little spot.\r\n\r\nHarding examined it; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the window.\r\n\r\nThe telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last stopped on\r\nthe looked-for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it, pronounced one word\r\nonly,--\r\n\r\n“A vessel!”\r\n\r\nAnd in fact a vessel was in sight, off Lincoln Island!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 3\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nIt was now two years and a half since the castaways from the balloon had\r\nbeen thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period there had been no\r\ncommunication between them and their fellow-creatures. Once the reporter\r\nhad attempted to communicate with the inhabited world by confiding to\r\na bird a letter which contained the secret of their situation, but that\r\nwas a chance on which it was impossible to reckon seriously. Ayrton,\r\nalone, under the circumstances which have been related, had come to\r\njoin the little colony. Now, suddenly, on this day, the 17th of October,\r\nother men had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island, on that\r\ndeserted sea!\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt about it! A vessel was there! But would she\r\npass on, or would she put into port? In a few hours the colonists would\r\ndefinitely know what to expect.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon Spilett,\r\nPencroft, and Neb into the dining-room of Granite House, told them\r\nwhat had happened. Pencroft, seizing the telescope, rapidly swept the\r\nhorizon, and stopping on the indicated point, that is to say, on\r\nthat which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic\r\nnegative,--\r\n\r\n“I’m blessed but it is really a vessel!” he exclaimed, in a voice which\r\ndid not express any great amount of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Is she coming here?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Impossible to say anything yet,” answered Pencroft, “for her rigging\r\nalone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can be seen.”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done?” asked the lad.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” replied Harding.\r\n\r\nAnd for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given up to\r\nall the thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the hopes, which\r\nwere aroused by this incident--the most important which had occurred\r\nsince their arrival in Lincoln Island. Certainly, the colonists were not\r\nin the situation of castaways abandoned on a sterile islet, constantly\r\ncontending against a cruel nature for their miserable existence, and\r\nincessantly tormented by the longing to return to inhabited countries.\r\nPencroft and Neb, especially, who felt themselves at once so happy and\r\nso rich, would not have left their island without regret. They were\r\naccustomed, besides, to this new life in the midst of the domain which\r\ntheir intelligence had as it were civilized. But at any rate this ship\r\nbrought news from the world, perhaps even from their native land. It was\r\nbringing fellow-creatures to them, and it may be conceived how deeply\r\ntheir hearts were moved at the sight!\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at the\r\nwindow. From thence he very attentively examined the vessel, which was\r\nat a distance of twenty miles to the east. The colonists had as yet,\r\ntherefore, no means of signalizing their presence. A flag would not have\r\nbeen perceived; a gun would not have been heard; a fire would not have\r\nbeen visible. However, it was certain that the island, overtopped by\r\nMount Franklin, could not escape the notice of the vessel’s lookout. But\r\nwhy was the ship coming there? Was it simple chance which brought it to\r\nthat part of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor\r\nIsland, which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels\r\nfrom the Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the\r\nAmerican coast? To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply\r\nwas suddenly made by Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Can it be the ‘Duncan’?” he cried.\r\n\r\nThe “Duncan,” as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan’s yacht, which had\r\nleft Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there someday to fetch\r\nhim. Now, the islet was not so far distant from Lincoln Island, but\r\nthat a vessel, standing for the one, could pass in sight of the other. A\r\nhundred and fifty miles only separated them in longitude, and seventy in\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\n“We must tell Ayrton,” said Gideon Spilett, “and send for him\r\nimmediately. He alone can say if it is the ‘Duncan.’”\r\n\r\nThis was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic\r\napparatus which placed the corral in communication with Granite House,\r\nsent this telegram:--“Come with all possible speed.”\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the bell sounded.\r\n\r\n“I am coming,” replied Ayrton.\r\n\r\nThen the settlers continued to watch the vessel.\r\n\r\n“If it is the ‘Duncan,’” said Herbert, “Ayrton will recognize her\r\nwithout difficulty, since he sailed on board her for some time.”\r\n\r\n“And if he recognizes her,” added Pencroft, “it will agitate him\r\nexceedingly!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Cyrus Harding; “but now Ayrton is worthy to return on\r\nboard the ‘Duncan,’ and pray Heaven that it is indeed Lord Glenarvan’s\r\nyacht, for I should be suspicious of any other vessel. These are\r\nill-famed seas, and I have always feared a visit from Malay pirates to\r\nour island.”\r\n\r\n“We could defend it,’, cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“No doubt, my boy,” answered the engineer smiling, “but it would be\r\nbetter not to have to defend it.”\r\n\r\n“A useless observation,” said Spilett. “Lincoln Island is unknown to\r\nnavigators, since it is not marked even on the most recent maps. Do\r\nyou think, Cyrus, that that is a sufficient motive for a ship, finding\r\nherself unexpectedly in sight of new land, to try and visit rather than\r\navoid it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“I think so too,” added the engineer. “It may even be said that it is\r\nthe duty of a captain to come and survey any land or island not yet\r\nknown, and Lincoln Island is in this position.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroft, “suppose this vessel comes and anchors there a\r\nfew cables-lengths from our island, what shall we do?”\r\n\r\nThis sudden question remained at first without any reply. But Cyrus\r\nHarding, after some moments’ thought, replied in the calm tone which was\r\nusual to him,--\r\n\r\n“What we shall do, my friends? What we ought to do is this:--we will\r\ncommunicate with the ship, we will take our passage on board her, and we\r\nwill leave our island, after having taken possession of it in the name\r\nof the United States. Then we will return with any who may wish to\r\nfollow us to colonize it definitely, and endow the American Republic\r\nwith a useful station in this part of the Pacific Ocean!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” exclaimed Pencroft, “and that will be no small present\r\nwhich we shall make to our country! The colonization is already almost\r\nfinished; names are given to every part of the island; there is\r\na natural port, fresh water, roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and\r\nmanufactories; and there will be nothing to be done but to inscribe\r\nLincoln Island on the maps!”\r\n\r\n“But if anyone seizes it in our absence?” observed Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Hang it!” cried the sailor. “I would rather remain all alone to guard\r\nit: and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn’t steal it from him, like a\r\nwatch from the pocket of a swell!”\r\n\r\nFor an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the\r\nvessel was or was not standing towards Lincoln Island. She was\r\nnearer, but in what direction was she sailing? This Pencroft could not\r\ndetermine. However, as the wind was blowing from the northeast, in all\r\nprobability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack. Besides, the\r\nwind was favorable for bringing her towards the island, and, the sea\r\nbeing calm, she would not be afraid to approach although the shallows\r\nwere not marked on the chart.\r\n\r\nTowards four o’clock--an hour after he had been sent for--Ayrton arrived\r\nat Granite House. He entered the dining-room saying,--\r\n\r\n“At your service, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and, leading\r\nhim to the window,--\r\n\r\n“Ayrton,” said he, “we have begged you to come here for an important\r\nreason. A ship is in sight of the island.”\r\n\r\nAyrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became dim;\r\nthen, leaning out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but could see\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“Take this telescope,” said Spilett, “and look carefully, Ayrton, for\r\nit is possible that this ship may be the ‘Duncan’ come to these seas for\r\nthe purpose of taking you home again.”\r\n\r\n“The ‘Duncan!’” murmured Ayrton. “Already?” This last word escaped\r\nAyrton’s lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped upon his hands.\r\n\r\nDid not twelve years’ solitude on a desert island appear to him a\r\nsufficient expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned,\r\neither in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?\r\n\r\n“No,” said he, “no! it cannot be the ‘Duncan’!”\r\n\r\n“Look, Ayrton,” then said the engineer, “for it is necessary that we\r\nshould know beforehand what to expect.”\r\n\r\nAyrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated. During\r\nsome minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without uttering a\r\nword. Then,--\r\n\r\n“It is indeed a vessel,” said he, “but I do not think she is the\r\n‘Duncan.’”\r\n\r\n“Why do you not think so?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Because the ‘Duncan’ is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive any trace\r\nof smoke either above or near that vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she is simply sailing,” observed Pencroft. “The wind is\r\nfavorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she may\r\nbe anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft,” answered Ayrton,\r\n“and that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must wait until she\r\nis nearer, and then we shall soon know what to expect.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained silent.\r\nThe colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton took no\r\npart in the conversation. All were in such a mood that they found it\r\nimpossible to continue their work. Gideon Spilett and Pencroft were\r\nparticularly nervous, going, coming, not able to remain still in one\r\nplace. Herbert felt more curiosity. Neb alone maintained his usual\r\ncalm manner. Was not his country that where his master was? As to the\r\nengineer, he remained plunged in deep thought, and in his heart feared\r\nrather than desired the arrival of the ship. In the meanwhile, the\r\nvessel was a little nearer the island. With the aid of the glass, it was\r\nascertained that she was a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, which\r\nare generally used by the pirates of the Pacific. It was, therefore,\r\nreasonable to believe that the engineer’s apprehensions would not be\r\njustified, and that the presence of this vessel in the vicinity of the\r\nisland was fraught with no danger.\r\n\r\nPencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to affirm that\r\nthe vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was standing obliquely\r\ntowards the coast, on the starboard tack, under her topsails and\r\ntop-gallant-sails. This was confirmed by Ayrton. But by continuing in\r\nthis direction she must soon disappear behind Claw Cape, as the wind\r\nwas from the southwest, and to watch her it would be then necessary\r\nto ascend the height of Washington Bay, near Port Balloon--a provoking\r\ncircumstance, for it was already five o’clock in the evening, and the\r\ntwilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do when night comes on?” asked Gideon Spilett. “Shall we\r\nlight a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?”\r\n\r\nThis was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer still\r\nretained some of his presentiments, it was answered in the affirmative.\r\nDuring the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever, and, this\r\nship gone, would another ever return to the waters of Lincoln Island?\r\nWho could foresee what the future would then have in store for the\r\ncolonists?\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the reporter, “we ought to make known to that vessel,\r\nwhoever she may be, that the island is inhabited. To neglect the\r\nopportunity which is offered to us might be to create everlasting\r\nregrets.”\r\n\r\nIt was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port\r\nBalloon, and that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense\r\nfire, the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of the\r\nbrig.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to leave\r\nGranite House, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and stood\r\ndirectly for Union Bay. The brig was a good sailer, for she approached\r\nrapidly. Neb and Pencroft put off their departure, therefore, and the\r\nglass was put into Ayrton’s hands, that he might ascertain for certain\r\nwhether the ship was or was not the “Duncan.” The Scotch yacht was also\r\nrigged as a brig. The question was, whether a chimney could be discerned\r\nbetween the two masts of the vessel, which was now at a distance of only\r\nfive miles.\r\n\r\nThe horizon was still very clear. The examination was easy, and Ayrton\r\nsoon let the glass fall again, saying--\r\n\r\n“It is not the ‘Duncan’! It could not be!”\r\n\r\nPencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and\r\ncould see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden,\r\nwonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably built, and must be a very\r\nrapid sailer. But to what nation did she belong? That was difficult to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” added the sailor, “a flag is floating from her peak, but I\r\ncannot distinguish the colors of it.”\r\n\r\n“In half an hour we shall be certain about that,” answered the reporter.\r\n“Besides, it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this\r\nship is to land, and, consequently, if not today, to-morrow at the\r\nlatest, we shall make his acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind!” said Pencroft. “It is best to know whom we have to deal\r\nwith, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow’s colors!”\r\n\r\nAnd, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass. The day began\r\nto fade, and with the day the breeze fell also. The brig’s ensign hung\r\nin folds, and it became more and more difficult to observe it.\r\n\r\n“It is not the American flag,” said Pencroft from time to time, “nor the\r\nEnglish, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the French or German\r\ncolors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow of Spain. One would\r\nsay it was all one color. Let’s see: in these seas, what do we generally\r\nmeet with? The Chilean flag?--but that is tri-color. Brazilian?--it is\r\ngreen. Japanese?--it is yellow and black, while this--”\r\n\r\nAt that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag. Ayrton seizing the\r\ntelescope which the sailor had put down, put it to his eye, and in a\r\nhoarse voice,--\r\n\r\n“The black flag!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the brig,\r\nand they had now good reason for considering her to be a suspicious\r\nvessel!\r\n\r\nHad the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments? Was this a\r\npirate vessel? Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the Malay proas\r\nwhich still infest it? For what had she come to look at the shores of\r\nLincoln Island? Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become\r\na magazine for stolen cargoes? Had she come to find on the coast a\r\nsheltered port for the winter months? Was the settlers’ honest domain\r\ndestined to be transformed into an infamous refuge--the headquarters of\r\nthe piracy of the Pacific?\r\n\r\nAll these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the colonists’\r\nimaginations. There was no doubt, besides, of the signification which\r\nmust be attached to the color of the hoisted flag. It was that of\r\npirates! It was that which the “Duncan” would have carried, had the\r\nconvicts succeeded in their criminal design! No time was lost before\r\ndiscussing it.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, “perhaps this vessel only wishes to\r\nsurvey the coast of the island. Perhaps her crew will not land. There is\r\na chance of it. However that may be, we ought to do everything we can to\r\nhide our presence here. The windmill on Prospect Heights is too easily\r\nseen. Let Ayrton and Neb go and take down the sails. We must also\r\nconceal the windows of Granite House with thick branches. All the fires\r\nmust be extinguished, so that nothing may betray the presence of men on\r\nthe island.”\r\n\r\n“And our vessel?” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” answered Pencroft, “she is sheltered in Port Balloon, and I defy\r\nany of those rascals there to find her!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s orders were immediately executed. Neb and Ayrton\r\nascended the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal\r\nany indication of a settlement. While they were thus occupied, their\r\ncompanions went to the border of Jacamar Wood, and brought back a large\r\nquantity of branches and creepers, which would at some distance appear\r\nas natural foliage, and thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff.\r\nAt the same time, the ammunition and guns were placed ready so as to be\r\nat hand in case of an unexpected attack.\r\n\r\nWhen all these precautions had been taken,--\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion, “if the\r\nwretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend it--shall we\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cyrus,” replied the reporter, “and if necessary we will die to\r\ndefend it!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it warmly.\r\nAyrton remained in his corner, not joining the colonists. Perhaps he,\r\nthe former convict, still felt himself unworthy to do so!\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton’s mind, and going to\r\nhim--\r\n\r\n“And you, Ayrton,” he asked, “what will you do?”\r\n\r\n“My duty,” answered Ayrton.\r\n\r\nHe then took up his station near the window and gazed through the\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\nIt was now half-past seven. The sun had disappeared twenty minutes ago\r\nbehind Granite House. Consequently the Eastern horizon was becoming\r\nobscured. In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards Union\r\nBay. She was now not more than two miles off, and exactly opposite the\r\nplateau of Prospect Heights, for after having tacked off Claw Cape, she\r\nhad drifted towards the north in the current of the rising tide. One\r\nmight have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast\r\nbay, for a straight line drawn from Claw Cape to Cape Mandible would\r\nhave rested on her starboard quarter.\r\n\r\nWas the brig about to penetrate far into the bay? That was the first\r\nquestion. When once in the bay, would she anchor there? That was the\r\nsecond. Would she not content herself with only surveying the coast, and\r\nstand out to sea again without landing her crew? They would know this in\r\nan hour. The colonists could do nothing but wait.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black flag\r\nwithout deep anxiety. Was it not a direct menace against the work which\r\nhe and his companions had till now conducted so successfully? Had these\r\npirates--for the sailors of the brig could be nothing else--already\r\nvisited the island, since on approaching it they had hoisted their\r\ncolors. Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable\r\npeculiarities might be explained in this way? Did there exist in the as\r\nyet unexplored parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication\r\nwith them?\r\n\r\nTo all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding knew not\r\nwhat to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony could not but\r\nbe seriously threatened by the arrival of the brig.\r\n\r\nHowever, he and his companions were determined to fight to the last\r\ngasp. It would have been very important to know if the pirates\r\nwere numerous and better armed than the colonists. But how was this\r\ninformation to be obtained?\r\n\r\nNight fell. The new moon had disappeared. Profound darkness enveloped\r\nthe island and the sea. No light could pierce through the heavy piles\r\nof clouds on the horizon. The wind had died away completely with the\r\ntwilight. Not a leaf rustled on the trees, not a ripple murmured on\r\nthe shore. Nothing could be seen of the ship, all her lights being\r\nextinguished, and if she was still in sight of the island, her\r\nwhereabouts could not be discovered.\r\n\r\n“Well! who knows?” said Pencroft. “Perhaps that cursed craft will stand\r\noff during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak.”\r\n\r\nAs if in reply to the sailor’s observation, a bright light flashed in\r\nthe darkness, and a cannon-shot was heard.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was still there and had guns on board.\r\n\r\nSix seconds elapsed between the flash and the report.\r\n\r\nTherefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the chains were heard rattling through the\r\nhawse-holes.\r\n\r\nThe vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any doubt as to the pirates’ intentions. They had\r\ndropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it was evident\r\nthat the next day by means of their boats they purposed to land on the\r\nbeach!\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but, determined\r\nthough they were, they must not forget to be prudent. Perhaps their\r\npresence might still be concealed in the event of the pirates contenting\r\nthemselves with landing on the shore without examining the interior of\r\nthe island. It might be, indeed, that their only intention was to obtain\r\nfresh water from the Mercy, and it was not impossible that the bridge,\r\nthrown across a mile and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory at\r\nthe Chimneys might escape their notice.\r\n\r\nBut why was that flag hoisted at the brig’s peak? What was that shot\r\nfired for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of\r\ntaking possession. Harding knew now that the vessel was well armed. And\r\nwhat had the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the pirates’ guns?\r\nA few muskets only.\r\n\r\n“However,” observed Cyrus Harding, “here we are in an impregnable\r\nposition. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the outlet, now that it\r\nis hidden under reeds and grass, and consequently it would be impossible\r\nfor them to penetrate into Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all, everything!”\r\n exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. “They may spoil everything,\r\ndestroy everything in a few hours!”\r\n\r\n“Everything, Pencroft,” answered Harding, “and we have no means of\r\npreventing them.”\r\n\r\n“Are they numerous? that is the question,” said the reporter. “If they\r\nare not more than a dozen, we shall be able to stop them, but forty,\r\nfifty, more perhaps!”\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding,” then said Ayrton, advancing towards the engineer,\r\n“will you give me leave?”\r\n\r\n“For what, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“To go to that vessel to find out the strength of her crew.”\r\n\r\n“But Ayrton--” answered the engineer, hesitating, “you will risk your\r\nlife--”\r\n\r\n“Why not, sir?”\r\n\r\n“That is more than your duty.”\r\n\r\n“I have more than my duty to do,” replied Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“Will you go to the ship in the boat?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, but I will swim. A boat would be seen where a man may glide\r\nbetween wind and water.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know that the brig is a mile and a quarter from the shore?” said\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“I am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you it is risking your life,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“That is no matter,” answered Ayrton. “Captain Harding, I ask this as a\r\nfavor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes!”\r\n\r\n“Go, Ayrton,” replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal would\r\nhave deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest man.\r\n\r\n“I will accompany you,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“You mistrust me!” said Ayrton quickly.\r\n\r\nThen more humbly,--\r\n\r\n“Alas!”\r\n\r\n“No! no!” exclaimed Harding with animation, “no, Ayrton, Pencroft does\r\nnot mistrust you. You interpret his words wrongly.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” returned the sailor, “I only propose to accompany Ayrton as\r\nfar as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely possible, that one\r\nof these villains has landed, and in that case two men will not be too\r\nmany to hinder him from giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the\r\nislet, and he shall go alone to the vessel, since he has proposed to do\r\nso.” These things agreed to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure.\r\nHis plan was bold, but it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the\r\nnight. Once arrived at the vessel’s side, Ayrton, holding on to the main\r\nchains, might reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions\r\nof the pirates.\r\n\r\nAyrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the\r\nbeach. Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as to suffer\r\nless from the temperature of the water, which was still cold. He might,\r\nindeed, be obliged to remain in it for several hours.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat, moored\r\na few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and by the time\r\nthey returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was thrown over his\r\nshoulders, and the settlers all came round him to press his hand.\r\n\r\nAyrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared\r\nin the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite\r\nshore of the islet. This was not done without precaution, for fear lest\r\nthe pirates might be roaming about there. But after a careful survey,\r\nit was evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton then, followed by\r\nPencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the\r\nholes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea,\r\nand swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights\r\nhad recently appeared, showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft,\r\nhe crouched down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke, glided\r\nthrough the sheet of water without producing the slightest ripple. His\r\nhead just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of\r\nthe brig, from which the lights were reflected in the water. He thought\r\nonly of the duty which he had promised to accomplish, and nothing of the\r\ndanger which he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea, often\r\nfrequented by sharks. The current bore him along and he rapidly receded\r\nfrom the shore.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen or\r\nheard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains. He took\r\nbreath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of\r\nthe cutwater. There were drying several pairs of sailors’ trousers. He\r\nput on a pair. Then settling himself firmly, he listened. They were not\r\nsleeping on board the brig. On the contrary, they were talking, singing,\r\nlaughing. And these were the sentences, accompanied with oaths, which\r\nprincipally struck Ayrton:--\r\n\r\n“Our brig is a famous acquisition.”\r\n\r\n“She sails well, and merits her name of the ‘Speedy.’”\r\n\r\n“She would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of heels.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for her captain!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Bob Harvey!”\r\n\r\nWhat Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be\r\nunderstood when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he recognized one\r\nof his old Australian companions, a daring sailor, who had continued his\r\ncriminal career. Bob Harvey had seized, on the shores of Norfolk Island\r\nthis brig, which was loaded with arms, ammunition, utensils, and tools\r\nof all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands. All his gang had\r\ngone on board, and pirates after having been convicts, these wretches,\r\nmore ferocious than the Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific,\r\ndestroying vessels, and massacring their crews.\r\n\r\nThe convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply\r\nat the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered. The actual crew\r\nof the “Speedy” was composed solely of English prisoners, escaped from\r\nNorfolk Island.\r\n\r\nHere it may be well to explain what this island was. In 29deg 2’ south\r\nlatitude, and 165deg 42’ east longitude, to the east of Australia, is\r\nfound a little island, six miles in circumference, overlooked by Mount\r\nPitt, which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nThis is Norfolk Island, once the seat of an establishment in which were\r\nlodged the most intractable convicts from the English penitentiaries.\r\nThey numbered 500, under an iron discipline, threatened with terrible\r\npunishments, and were guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150 employed\r\nunder the orders of the governor. It would be difficult to imagine\r\na collection of greater ruffians. Sometimes,--although very\r\nrarely,--notwithstanding the extreme surveillance of which they were\r\nthe object, many managed to escape, and seizing vessels which they\r\nsurprised, they infested the Polynesian Archipelagoes.\r\n\r\nThus had Bob Harvey and his companions done. Thus had Ayrton formerly\r\nwished to do. Bob Harvey had seized the brig “Speedy,” anchored in sight\r\nof Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred; and for a year this ship\r\nhad scoured the Pacific, under the command of Harvey, now a pirate, and\r\nwell known to Ayrton!\r\n\r\nThe convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop; but a\r\nfew, stretched on the deck, were talking loudly.\r\n\r\nThe conversation still continued amid shouts and libations. Ayrton\r\nlearned that chance alone had brought the “Speedy” in sight of Lincoln\r\nIsland; Bob Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as Cyrus Harding\r\nhad conjectured, finding this unknown land in his course, its position\r\nbeing marked on no chart, he had formed the project of visiting it, and,\r\nif he found it suitable, of making it the brig’s headquarters.\r\n\r\nAs to the black flag hoisted at the “Speedy’s” peak, and the gun which\r\nhad been fired, in imitation of men-of-war when they lower their\r\ncolors, it was pure piratical bravado. It was in no way a signal, and no\r\ncommunication yet existed between the convicts and Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nThe settlers’ domain was now menaced with terrible danger. Evidently\r\nthe island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so\r\nincreased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by\r\nGranite House, could not but be convenient for the convicts; in their\r\nhands it would become an excellent place of refuge, and, being unknown,\r\nit would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity and security.\r\nEvidently, also, the lives of the settlers would not be respected, and\r\nBob Harvey and his accomplices’ first care would be to massacre them\r\nwithout mercy. Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the\r\nchoice of flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts\r\nintended to reside there, and since, in the event of the “Speedy”\r\n departing on an expedition, it was probable that some of the crew would\r\nremain on shore, so as to settle themselves there. Therefore, it\r\nwould be necessary to fight, to destroy every one of these scoundrels,\r\nunworthy of pity, and against whom any means would be right. So thought\r\nAyrton, and he well knew that Cyrus Harding would be of his way of\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nBut was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible? That would\r\ndepend on the equipment of the brig, and the number of men which she\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nThis Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after his\r\narrival the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large number\r\nof the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep, Ayrton did not\r\nhesitate to venture onto the “Speedy’s” deck, which the extinguished\r\nlanterns now left in total darkness. He hoisted himself onto the\r\ncutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle. Then, gliding\r\namong the convicts stretched here and there, he made the round of the\r\nship, and found that the “Speedy” carried four guns, which would throw\r\nshot of from eight to ten pounds in weight. He found also, on touching\r\nthem that these guns were breech-loaders. They were therefore, of modern\r\nmake, easily used, and of terrible effect.\r\n\r\nAs to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but\r\nit was to be supposed that more were sleeping down below. Besides, by\r\nlistening to them, Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on\r\nboard. That was a large number for the six settlers of Lincoln Island to\r\ncontend with! But now, thanks to Ayrton’s devotion, Cyrus Harding would\r\nnot be surprised, he would know the strength of his adversaries, and\r\nwould make his arrangements accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and render to his\r\ncompanions an account of the mission with which he had charged himself,\r\nand he prepared to regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let\r\nhimself down into the water. But to this man, whose wish was, as he had\r\nsaid, to do more than his duty, there came an heroic thought. This was\r\nto sacrifice his own life, but save the island and the colonists. Cyrus\r\nHarding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who,\r\neither by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving\r\nout the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he\r\nthought of his preservers--those who had made him again a man, and an\r\nhonest mm, those to whom he owed all--murdered without pity, their works\r\ndestroyed, their island turned into a pirates’ den! He said to himself\r\nthat he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many disasters, since his\r\nold companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized his own plans, and a\r\nfeeling of horror took possession of him. Then he was seized with an\r\nirresistible desire to blow up the brig and with her, all whom she had\r\non board. He would perish in the explosion, but he would have done his\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nAyrton did not hesitate. To reach the powder-room, which is always\r\nsituated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy. There would be no want\r\nof powder in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be\r\nenough to destroy it in an instant.\r\n\r\nAyrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with numerous\r\nsleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A lantern was lighted\r\nat the foot of the mainmast, round which was hung a gun-rack, furnished\r\nwith weapons of all sorts.\r\n\r\nAyrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that it was\r\nloaded and primed. Nothing more was needed to accomplish the work of\r\ndestruction. He then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the\r\nbrig’s poop at the powder-magazine.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without\r\nstumbling over some half-sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths and\r\nkicks. Ayrton was, therefore, more than once obliged to halt. But at\r\nlast he arrived at the partition dividing the aftercabin, and found the\r\ndoor opening into the magazine itself.\r\n\r\nAyrton, compelled to force it open, set to work. It was a difficult\r\noperation to perform without noise, for he had to break a padlock. But\r\nunder his vigorous hand, the padlock broke, and the door was open.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” asked a tall man, in a harsh voice, who,\r\nstanding in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern in Ayrton’s\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAyrton drew back. In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had recognized\r\nhis former accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have known him, as he\r\nmust have thought Ayrton long since dead.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the\r\nwaistband.\r\n\r\nBut Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp and\r\nattempted to rush into the magazine. A shot fired into the midst of the\r\npowder-casks, and all would be over!\r\n\r\n“Help, lads!” shouted Bob Harvey.\r\n\r\nAt his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing on\r\nAyrton, endeavored to throw him down. He soon extricated himself from\r\ntheir grasp. He fired his revolver, and two of the convicts fell, but\r\na blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nAyrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project.\r\nBob Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder-magazine, and a movement\r\non the deck indicated a general awakening of the pirates. Ayrton must\r\nreserve himself to fight at the side of Cyrus Harding. There was nothing\r\nfor him but flight!\r\n\r\nBut was flight still possible? It was doubtful, yet Ayrton resolved to\r\ndare everything in order to rejoin his companions.\r\n\r\nFour barrels of the revolver were still undischarged. Two were\r\nfired--one, aimed at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate\r\nonly slightly, and Ayrton, profiting by the momentary retreat of his\r\nadversaries, rushed towards the companion-ladder to gain the deck.\r\nPassing before the lantern, he smashed it with a blow from the butt of\r\nhis revolver. A profound darkness ensued, which favored his flight. Two\r\nor three pirates, awakened by the noise, were descending the ladder at\r\nthe same moment.\r\n\r\nA fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back, not\r\nunderstanding what was going on. Ayrton was on deck in two bounds, and\r\nthree seconds later, having discharged his last barrel in the face of\r\na pirate who was about to seize him by the throat, he leaped over the\r\nbulwarks into the sea.\r\n\r\nAyrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing around him\r\nlike hail.\r\n\r\nWhat were Pencroft’s feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet! What\r\nwere those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb, crouched in the\r\nChimneys, when they heard the reports on board the brig! They rushed out\r\non to the beach, and, their guns shouldered, they stood ready to repel\r\nany attack.\r\n\r\nThey had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the pirates,\r\nhad been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit by the night\r\nto make a descent on the island!\r\n\r\nHalf an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had ceased, and\r\nyet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the islet invaded?\r\nOught they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and Pencroft? But how? The\r\ntide being high at that time, rendered the channel impassable. The boat\r\nwas not there! We may imagine the horrible anxiety which took possession\r\nof Harding and his companions!\r\n\r\nAt last, towards half-past twelve, a boat, carrying two men, touched the\r\nbeach. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and Pencroft,\r\nsafe and sound, whom their friends received with open arms.\r\n\r\nAll immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton recounted all\r\nthat had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the brig, which he had\r\nattempted to put into execution.\r\n\r\nAll hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them that\r\ntheir situation was serious. The pirates had been alarmed. They knew\r\nthat Lincoln Island was inhabited. They would land upon it in numbers\r\nand well armed. They would respect nothing. Should the settlers fall\r\ninto their hands, they must expect no mercy!\r\n\r\n“Well, we shall know how to die!” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Let us go in and watch,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Have we any chance of escape, captain?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“Hum! six against fifty!”\r\n\r\n“Yes! six! without counting--”\r\n\r\n“Who?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\nCyrus did not reply, but pointed upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nThe night passed without incident. The colonists were on the qui vive,\r\nand did not leave their post at the Chimneys. The pirates, on their\r\nside, did not appear to have made any attempt to land. Since the last\r\nshots fired at Ayrton not a report, not even a sound, had betrayed the\r\npresence of the brig in the neighborhood of the island. It might have\r\nbeen fancied that she had weighed anchor, thinking that she had to deal\r\nwith her match, and had left the coast.\r\n\r\nBut it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the settlers could\r\nsee a confused mass through the morning mist. It was the “Speedy.”\r\n\r\n“These, my friends,” said the engineer, “are the arrangements which\r\nappear to me best to make before the fog completely clears away. It\r\nhides us from the eyes of the pirates, and we can act without attracting\r\ntheir attention. The most important thing is, that the convicts\r\nshould believe that the inhabitants of the island are numerous, and\r\nconsequently capable of resisting them. I therefore propose that we\r\ndivide into three parties. The first of which shall be posted at the\r\nChimneys, the second at the mouth of the Mercy. As to the third, I think\r\nit would be best to place it on the islet, so as to prevent, or at all\r\nevents delay, any attempt at landing. We have the use of two rifles and\r\nfour muskets. Each of us will be armed, and, as we are amply provided\r\nwith powder and shot, we need not spare our fire. We have nothing to\r\nfear from the muskets nor even from the guns of the brig. What can they\r\ndo against these rocks? And, as we shall not fire from the windows of\r\nGranite House, the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage\r\nby throwing shell against it. What is to be feared is, the necessity of\r\nmeeting hand-to-hand, since the convicts have numbers on their side. We\r\nmust therefore try to prevent them from landing, but without discovering\r\nourselves. Therefore, do not economize the ammunition. Fire often, but\r\nwith a sure aim. We have each eight or ten enemies to kill, and they\r\nmust be killed!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although he spoke\r\nin the calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing a piece\r\nof work and not ordering a battle. His companions approved these\r\narrangements without even uttering a word. There was nothing more to be\r\ndone but for each to take his place before the fog should be completely\r\ndissipated. Neb and Pencroft immediately ascended to Granite House and\r\nbrought back a sufficient quantity of ammunition. Gideon Spilett and\r\nAyrton, both very good marksmen, were armed with the two rifles,\r\nwhich carried nearly a mile. The four other muskets were divided among\r\nHarding, Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert.\r\n\r\nThe posts were arranged in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys, thus\r\ncommanding the shore to the foot of Granite House.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of the\r\nMercy, from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to prevent any\r\none from crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nAs to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and prepared to\r\ncross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet.\r\nIn this way, shots being fired from four different points at once,\r\nthe convicts would be led to believe that the island was both largely\r\npeopled and strongly defended.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a landing being effected without their having been able\r\nto prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the point of being\r\ncut off by the brig’s boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were to return in their\r\nboat to the shore and proceed towards the threatened spot.\r\n\r\nBefore starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the last time\r\nwrung each other’s hands.\r\n\r\nPencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to suppress his\r\nemotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then they separated.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb\r\non the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later\r\nAyrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty crossed the channel,\r\ndisembarked on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its\r\neastern shore.\r\n\r\nNone of them could have been seen, for they themselves could scarcely\r\ndistinguish the brig in the fog.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past six in the morning.\r\n\r\nSoon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig issued\r\nfrom the vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of\r\nthe sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly dispelled the mist.\r\n\r\nThe “Speedy” now appeared in full view, with a spring on her cable, her\r\nhead to the north, presenting her larboard side to the island. Just as\r\nHarding had calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nThe sinister black flag floated from the peak.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns on board\r\nwere pointed at the island. They were evidently ready to fire at a\r\nmoment’s notice.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the “Speedy” remained silent. About thirty pirates\r\ncould be seen moving on the deck. A few more on the poop; two others\r\nposted in the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were attentively\r\nsurveying the island.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to give an\r\naccount of what had happened during the night on board the brig. Had\r\nthis half-naked man, who had forced the door of the powder-magazine, and\r\nwith whom they had struggled, who had six times discharged his revolver\r\nat them, who had killed one and wounded two others, escaped their shot?\r\nHad he been able to swim to shore? Whence did he come? What had been his\r\nobject? Had his design really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey\r\nhad thought? All this must be confused enough to the convicts’ minds.\r\nBut what they could no longer doubt was that the unknown island before\r\nwhich the “Speedy” had cast anchor was inhabited, and that there was,\r\nperhaps, a numerous colony ready to defend it. And yet no one was to be\r\nseen, neither on the shore, nor on the heights. The beach appeared to be\r\nabsolutely deserted. At any rate, there was no trace of dwellings. Had\r\nthe inhabitants fled into the interior? Thus probably the pirate captain\r\nreasoned, and doubtless, like a prudent man, he wished to reconnoiter\r\nthe locality before he allowed his men to venture there.\r\n\r\nDuring an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing could be\r\nobserved on board the brig. Evidently Bob Harvey was hesitating. Even\r\nwith his strongest telescopes he could not have perceived one of the\r\nsettlers crouched among the rocks. It was not even probable that his\r\nattention had been awakened by the screen of green branches and creepers\r\nhiding the windows of Granite House, and showing rather conspicuously on\r\nthe bare rock. Indeed, how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed\r\nout, at that height, in the solid granite? From Claw Cape to the\r\nMandible Capes, in all the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to\r\nlead him to suppose that the island was or could be inhabited.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on board\r\nthe “Speedy.” A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into her. They\r\nwere armed with muskets; one took the yoke-lines, four others the oars,\r\nand the two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to fire, reconnoitered\r\nthe island. Their object was no doubt to make an examination but not to\r\nland, for in the latter case they would have come in larger numbers. The\r\npirates from their look-out could have seen that the coast was sheltered\r\nby an islet, separated from it by a channel half a mile in width.\r\nHowever, it was soon evident to Cyrus Harding, on observing the\r\ndirection followed by the boat, that they would not attempt to penetrate\r\ninto the channel, but would land on the islet.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock, saw them\r\ncoming directly towards them, and waited till they were within range.\r\n\r\nThe boat advanced with extreme caution. The oars only dipped into the\r\nwater at long intervals. It could now be seen that one of the convicts\r\nheld a lead-line in his hand, and that he wished to fathom the depth of\r\nthe channel hollowed out by the current of the Mercy. This showed that\r\nit was Bob Harvey’s intention to bring his brig as near as possible\r\nto the coast. About thirty pirates, scattered in the rigging, followed\r\nevery movement of the boat, and took the bearings of certain landmarks\r\nwhich would allow them to approach without danger. The boat was not more\r\nthan two cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped. The man at the\r\ntiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land.\r\n\r\nAt that moment two shots were heard. Smoke curled up from among the\r\nrocks of the islet. The man at the helm and the man with the lead-line\r\nfell backwards into the boat. Ayrton’s and Pencroft’s balls had struck\r\nthem both at the same moment.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke issued\r\nfrom the brig’s side, and a ball, striking the summit of the rock which\r\nsheltered Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters, but the two\r\nmarksmen remained unhurt.\r\n\r\nHorrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately continued\r\nits way. The man who had been at the tiller was replaced by one of his\r\ncomrades, and the oars were rapidly plunged into the water. However,\r\ninstead of returning on board as might have been expected, the boat\r\ncoasted along the islet, so as to round its southern point. The pirates\r\npulled vigorously at their oars that they might get out of range of the\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\nThey advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the\r\nshore terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a\r\nsemicircular line, still protected by the brig’s guns, they proceeded\r\ntowards the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nTheir evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and cut off\r\nthe colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that whatever their\r\nnumber might be, being placed between the fire from the boat and the\r\nfire from the brig, they would find themselves in a very disadvantageous\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction.\r\nAbsolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on the water.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of being\r\ncut off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish to show\r\nthemselves as yet to their assailants, and expose themselves to the\r\n“Speedy’s” guns, and that they relied on Neb and Gideon Spilett,\r\nwatching at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus Harding and Herbert, in\r\nambush among the rocks at the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was less than\r\ntwo cables-lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was beginning to rise with\r\nits accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the\r\npirates were drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard\r\nrowing that they were able to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as\r\nthey were passing within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls\r\nsaluted them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of\r\nthe boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim.\r\n\r\nThe brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by the\r\nsmoke, but without any other result than that of splintering the rock.\r\n\r\nThe boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the current,\r\nit shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow, passed before\r\nHarding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within range, withheld their\r\nfire, then, rounding the northern point of the islet with the two\r\nremaining oars, they pulled towards the brig.\r\n\r\nHitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their adversaries\r\nhad certainly had the worst of it. The latter already counted four men\r\nseriously wounded if not dead; they, on the contrary, unwounded, had not\r\nmissed a shot. If the pirates continued to attack them in this way, if\r\nthey renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat, they could be\r\ndestroyed one by one.\r\n\r\nIt was now seen how advantageous the engineer’s arrangements had\r\nbeen. The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and\r\nwell-armed adversaries, whom they could not easily get the better of.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the current,\r\ncould get alongside the “Speedy.” Frightful cries were heard when they\r\nreturned on board with the wounded, and two or three guns were fired\r\nwith no results.\r\n\r\nBut now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and possibly\r\nby the effect of the evening’s potations, threw themselves into the\r\nboat. A second boat was also lowered, in which eight men took their\r\nplaces, and while the first pulled straight for the islet, to dislodge\r\nthe colonists from thence the second maneuvered so as to force the\r\nentrance of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nThe situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft and\r\nAyrton, and they saw that they must regain the mainland.\r\n\r\nHowever, they waited till the first boat was within range, when two\r\nwell-directed balls threw its crew into disorder. Then, Pencroft and\r\nAyrton, abandoning their posts, under fire from the dozen muskets, ran\r\nacross the islet at full speed, jumped into their boat, crossed the\r\nchannel at the moment the second boat reached the southern end, and ran\r\nto hide themselves in the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the islet\r\nwas overrun with pirates in every direction. Almost at the same moment,\r\nfresh reports resounded from the Mercy station, to which the second boat\r\nwas rapidly approaching. Two, out of the eight men who manned her,\r\nwere mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett and Neb, and the boat herself,\r\ncarried irresistibly onto the reefs, was stove in at the mouth of the\r\nMercy. But the six survivors, holding their muskets above their heads to\r\npreserve them from contact with the water, managed to land on the right\r\nbank of the river. Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the\r\nambush there, they fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range\r\nof the balls.\r\n\r\nThe actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen convicts,\r\nof whom some were no doubt wounded, but who had still a boat at their\r\ndisposal; on the island were six, but who could not by any possibility\r\nreach Granite House, as they could not cross the river, all the bridges\r\nbeing raised.\r\n\r\n“Hallo,” exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys, “hallo,\r\ncaptain! What do you think of it, now?”\r\n\r\n“I think,” answered the engineer, “that the combat will now take a new\r\nform, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as\r\nto remain in a position so unfavorable for them!”\r\n\r\n“They won’t cross the channel,” said the sailor. “Ayrton and Mr.\r\nSpilett’s rifles are there to prevent them. You know that they carry\r\nmore than a mile!”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” replied Herbert; “but what can two rifles do against the\r\nbrig’s guns?”\r\n\r\n“Well, the brig isn’t in the channel yet, I fancy!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“But suppose she does come there?” said Harding.\r\n\r\n“That’s impossible, for she would risk running aground and being lost!”\r\n\r\n“It is possible,” said Ayrton. “The convicts might profit by the high\r\ntide to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low tide, it\r\nis true; but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts would be no\r\nlonger tenable.”\r\n\r\n“Confound them!” exclaimed Pencroft, “it really seems as if the\r\nblackguards were preparing to weigh anchor.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!” observed\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“We must wait!” answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“But Mr. Spilett and Neb?” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“They will know when it is best to rejoin us. Be ready, Ayrton. It is\r\nyours and Spilett’s rifles which must speak now.”\r\n\r\nIt was only too true. The “Speedy” was beginning to weigh her anchor,\r\nand her intention was evidently to approach the islet. The tide would\r\nbe rising for an hour and a half, and the ebb current being already\r\nweakened, it would be easy for the brig to advance. But as to entering\r\nthe channel, Pencroft, contrary to Ayrton’s opinion, could not believe\r\nthat she would dare to attempt it.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually\r\nadvanced to the opposite shore, and were now only separated from the\r\nmainland by the channel.\r\n\r\nBeing armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the settlers,\r\nin ambush at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy; but, not knowing\r\nthe latter to be supplied with long-range rifles, they on their side did\r\nnot believe themselves to be exposed. Quite uncovered, therefore, they\r\nsurveyed the islet, and examined the shore.\r\n\r\nTheir illusion was of short duration. Ayrton’s and Gideon Spilett’s\r\nrifles then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable\r\nintelligence to two of the convicts, for they fell backwards.\r\n\r\nThen there was a general helter-skelter. The ten others, not even\r\nstopping to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to the other\r\nside of the islet, tumbled into the boat which had brought them, and\r\npulled away with all their strength.\r\n\r\n“Eight less!” exclaimed Pencroft. “Really, one would have thought that\r\nMr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire together!”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, “this is becoming more\r\nserious. The brig is making sail!”\r\n\r\n“The anchor is weighed!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and she is already moving.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass. The\r\n“Speedy” was at first held by her anchor; then, when that had been\r\nraised, she began to drift towards the shore. The wind was blowing\r\nfrom the sea; the jib and the foretopsail were hoisted, and the vessel\r\ngradually approached the island.\r\n\r\nFrom the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched her\r\nwithout giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion. What\r\ncould be more terrible for the colonists than to be exposed, at a short\r\ndistance, to the brig’s guns, without being able to reply with any\r\neffect? How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would\r\nbe possible to do. Before long, he would be called upon for his\r\ndetermination. But what was it to be? To shut themselves up in Granite\r\nHouse, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for months even,\r\nsince they had an abundance of provisions? So far good! But after that?\r\nThe pirates would not the less be masters of the island, which they\r\nwould ravage at their pleasure, and in time, they would end by having\r\ntheir revenge on the prisoners in Granite House.\r\n\r\nHowever, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after all,\r\nwould not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would keep\r\noutside the islet. He would be still separated from the coast by half a\r\nmile, and at that distance his shot could not be very destructive.\r\n\r\n“Never!” repeated Pencroft, “Bob Harvey will never, if he is a good\r\nseaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk the brig,\r\nif the sea got up ever so little! And what would become of him without\r\nhis vessel?”\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be seen\r\nthat she was endeavoring to make the lower end. The breeze was light,\r\nand as the current had then lost much of its force, Bob Harvey had\r\nabsolute command over his vessel.\r\n\r\nThe route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to\r\nreconnoiter the channel, and she boldly entered it.\r\n\r\nThe pirate’s design was now only too evident; he wished to bring her\r\nbroadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with shell and\r\nball to the shot which had till then decimated her crew.\r\n\r\nSoon the “Speedy” reached the point of the islet; she rounded it with\r\nease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the wind, stood\r\nacross the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\n“The scoundrels! they are coming!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert, were\r\nrejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\nThe reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at\r\nthe Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they\r\nhad acted wisely. It was better that the colonists should be together at\r\nthe moment when they were about to engage in a decisive action. Gideon\r\nSpilett and Neb had arrived by dodging behind the rocks, though not\r\nwithout attracting a shower of bullets, which had not, however, reached\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Spilett! Neb!” cried the engineer. “You are not wounded?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the reporter, “a few bruises only from the ricochet! But\r\nthat cursed brig has entered the channel!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “and in ten minutes she will have anchored\r\nbefore Granite House!”\r\n\r\n“Have you formed any plan, Cyrus?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“We must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time, and the\r\nconvicts cannot see us.”\r\n\r\n“That is, my opinion, too,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but once shut up--”\r\n\r\n“We must be guided by circumstances,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Let us be off, then, and make haste!” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Would you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain here?”\r\n asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“What would be the use of that, Pencroft?” replied Harding. “No. We will\r\nnot separate!”\r\n\r\nThere was not a moment to be lost. The colonists left the Chimneys. A\r\nbend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig,\r\nbut two or three reports, and the crash of bullets on the rock, told\r\nthem that the “Speedy” was at no great distance.\r\n\r\nTo spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of Granite\r\nHouse, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening before, to\r\nrush into the large room, was the work of a minute only.\r\n\r\nIt was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could see the\r\n“Speedy,” surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel. The firing was\r\nincessant, and shot from the four guns struck blindly, both on the Mercy\r\npost, although it was not occupied, and on the Chimneys. The rocks were\r\nsplintered, and cheers accompanied each discharge. However, they\r\nwere hoping that Granite House would be spared, thanks to Harding’s\r\nprecaution of concealing the windows when a shot, piercing the door,\r\npenetrated into the passage.\r\n\r\n“We are discovered!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\nThe colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain that Bob\r\nHarvey had thought proper to send a ball through the suspected foliage\r\nwhich concealed that part of the cliff. Soon he redoubled his attack,\r\nwhen another ball having torn away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping\r\naperture in the granite.\r\n\r\nThe colonists’ situation was desperate. Their retreat was discovered.\r\nThey could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles, nor protect the\r\nstone, which flew in splinters around them. There was nothing to be\r\ndone but to take refuge in the upper passage of Granite House, and leave\r\ntheir dwelling to be devastated, when a deep roar was heard, followed by\r\nfrightful cries!\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the windows--\r\n\r\nThe brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout, had just split\r\nin two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her\r\ncriminal crew!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n“She has blown up!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes! blown up, just as if Ayrton had set fire to the powder!” returned\r\nPencroft, throwing himself into the lift together with Neb and the lad.\r\n\r\n“But what has happened?” asked Gideon Spilett, quite stunned by this\r\nunexpected catastrophe.\r\n\r\n“Oh! this time, we shall know--” answered the engineer quickly.\r\n\r\n“What shall we know?--”\r\n\r\n“Later! later! Come, Spilett. The main point is that these pirates have\r\nbeen exterminated!”\r\n\r\nAnd Cyrus Harding, hurrying away the reporter and Ayrton, joined\r\nPencroft, Neb, and Herbert on the beach.\r\n\r\nNothing could be seen of the brig, not even her masts. After having been\r\nraised by the water-spout, she had fallen on her side, and had sunk in\r\nthat position, doubtless in consequence of some enormous leak. But as\r\nin that place the channel was not more than twenty feet in depth, it\r\nwas certain that the sides of the submerged brig would reappear at low\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water, a raft\r\ncould be seen consisting of spare spars, coops of poultry with their\r\noccupants still living, boxes and barrels, which gradually came to the\r\nsurface, after having escaped through the hatchways, but no pieces of\r\nthe wreck appeared, neither planks from the deck, nor timber from the\r\nhull,--which rendered the sudden disappearance of the “Speedy” perfectly\r\ninexplicable.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two masts, which had been broken and escaped from the\r\nshrouds and stays came up, and with their sails, some furled and the\r\nothers spread. But it was not necessary to wait for the tide to bring\r\nup these riches, and Ayrton and Pencroft jumped into the boat with the\r\nintention of towing the pieces of wreck either to the beach or to the\r\nislet. But just as they were shoving off, an observation from Gideon\r\nSpilett arrested them.\r\n\r\n“What about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the\r\nMercy?” said he.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it would not do to forget that the six men whose boat had gone\r\nto pieces on the rocks had landed at Flotsam Point.\r\n\r\nThey looked in that direction. None of the fugitives were visible. It\r\nwas probable that, having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel,\r\nthey had fled into the interior of the island.\r\n\r\n“We will deal with them later,” said Harding. “As they are armed, they\r\nwill still be dangerous; but as it is six against six, the chances are\r\nequal. To the most pressing business first.”\r\n\r\nAyrton and Pencroft pulled vigorously towards the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe sea was calm and the tide very high, as there had been a new moon\r\nbut two days before. A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull\r\nof the brig could emerge from the water of the channel.\r\n\r\nAyrton and Pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by means of\r\nropes, the ends of which were carried to the beach. There, by the united\r\nefforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up. Then the\r\nboat picked up all that was floating, coops, barrels, and boxes, which\r\nwere immediately carried to the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nSeveral bodies floated also. Among them, Ayrton recognized that of\r\nBob Harvey, which he pointed out to his companion, saying with some\r\nemotion,--\r\n\r\n“That is what I have been, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“But what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!” returned the sailor warmly.\r\n\r\nIt was singular enough that so few bodies floated. Only five or six were\r\ncounted, which were already being carried by the current towards the\r\nopen sea. Very probably the convicts had not had time to escape, and\r\nthe ship lying over on her side, the greater number of them had remained\r\nbelow. Now the current, by carrying the bodies of these miserable men\r\nout to sea, would spare the colonists the sad task of burying them in\r\nsome corner of their island.\r\n\r\nFor two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely occupied\r\nin hauling up the spars on to the sand, and then in spreading the sails\r\nwhich were perfectly uninjured, to dry. They spoke little, for they were\r\nabsorbed in their work, but what thoughts occupied their minds!\r\n\r\nThe possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained, was\r\na perfect mine of wealth. In fact, a ship is like a little world in\r\nminiature, and the stores of the colony would be increased by a large\r\nnumber of useful articles. It would be, on a large scale, equivalent to\r\nthe chest found at Flotsam Point.\r\n\r\n“And besides,” thought Pencroft, “why should it be impossible to refloat\r\nthe brig? If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a vessel from\r\nthree to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship compared to our\r\n‘Bonadventure’! And we could go a long distance in her! We could go\r\nanywhere we liked! Captain Harding, Ayrton and I must examine her! She\r\nwould be well worth the trouble!”\r\n\r\nIn fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists’ chances\r\nof returning to their native land were singularly increased. But, to\r\ndecide this important question, it was necessary to wait until the tide\r\nwas quite low, so that every part of the brig’s hull might be examined.\r\n\r\nWhen their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding and his\r\ncompanions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast. They were almost\r\nfamished; fortunately, the larder was not far off, and Neb was noted\r\nfor being an expeditious cook. They breakfasted, therefore, near the\r\nChimneys, and during their repast, as may be supposed, nothing was\r\ntalked of but the event which had so miraculously saved the colony.\r\n\r\n“Miraculous is the word,” repeated Pencroft, “for it must be\r\nacknowledged that those rascals blew up just at the right moment!\r\nGranite House was beginning to be uncomfortable as a habitation!”\r\n\r\n“And can you guess, Pencroft,” asked the reporter, “how it happened, or\r\nwhat can have occasioned the explosion?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple,” answered Pencroft. “A convict\r\nvessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war! Convicts are not sailors.\r\nOf course the powder-magazine was open, and as they were firing\r\nincessantly, some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel!”\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding,” said Herbert, “what astonishes me is that the\r\nexplosion has not produced more effect. The report was not loud, and\r\nbesides there are so few planks and timbers torn out. It seems as if the\r\nship had rather foundered than blown up.”\r\n\r\n“Does that astonish you, my boy?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Yes, captain.”\r\n\r\n“And it astonishes me also, Herbert,” replied he, “but when we visit the\r\nhull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Why, captain,” said Pencroft, “you don’t suppose that the ‘Speedy’\r\nsimply foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock?”\r\n\r\n“Why not,” observed Neb, “if there are rocks in the channel?”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Neb,” answered Pencroft, “you did not look at the right\r\nmoment. An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well,\r\nrose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side. Now, if\r\nshe had only struck, she would have sunk quietly and gone to the bottom\r\nlike an honest vessel.”\r\n\r\n“It was just because she was not an honest vessel!” returned Neb.\r\n\r\n“Well, we shall soon see, Pencroft,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“We shall soon see,” rejoined the sailor, “but I would wager my\r\nhead there are no rocks in the channel. Look here, captain, to speak\r\ncandidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the\r\noccurrence?”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding did not answer.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Gideon Spilett, “whether rock or explosion, you will\r\nagree, Pencroft, that it occurred just in the nick of time!”\r\n\r\n“Yes! yes!” replied the sailor, “but that is not the question. I ask\r\nCaptain Harding if he sees anything supernatural in all this.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say, Pencroft,” said the engineer. “That is all the answer I\r\ncan make.”\r\n\r\nA reply which did not satisfy Pencroft at all. He stuck to “an\r\nexplosion,” and did not wish to give it up. He would never consent\r\nto admit that in that channel, with its fine sandy bed, just like\r\nthe beach, which he had often crossed at low water, there could be an\r\nunknown rock.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, at the time the brig foundered, it was high water, that is\r\nto say, there was enough water to carry the vessel clear over any rocks\r\nwhich would not be uncovered at low tide. Therefore, there could not\r\nhave been a collision. Therefore, the vessel had not struck. So she had\r\nblown up.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be confessed that the sailor’s arguments were reasonable.\r\n\r\nTowards half-past one, the colonists embarked in the boat to visit the\r\nwreck. It was to be regretted that the brig’s two boats had not been\r\nsaved; but one, as has been said, had gone to pieces at the mouth of the\r\nMercy, and was absolutely useless; the other had disappeared when the\r\nbrig went down, and had not again been seen, having doubtless been\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\nThe hull of the “Speedy” was just beginning to issue from the water.\r\nThe brig was lying right over on her side, for her masts being broken,\r\npressed down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock, the\r\nkeel was visible along her whole length. She had been regularly turned\r\nover by the inexplicable but frightful submarine action, which had been\r\nat the same time manifested by an enormous water-spout.\r\n\r\nThe settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide went\r\ndown, they could ascertain, if not the cause which had occasioned the\r\ncatastrophe, at least the effect produced.\r\n\r\nTowards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet from\r\nthe beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig were frightfully torn.\r\nOver a length of at least twenty feet there opened two large leaks,\r\nwhich would be impossible to stop up. Not only had the copper sheathing\r\nand the planks disappeared, reduced, no doubt, to powder, but also the\r\nribs, the iron bolts, and treenails which united them. From the entire\r\nlength of the hull to the stern the false keel had been separated with\r\nan unaccountable violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in\r\nseveral places, was split in all its length.\r\n\r\n“I’ve a notion!” exclaimed Pencroft, “that this vessel will be difficult\r\nto get afloat again.”\r\n\r\n“It will be impossible,” said Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, “the explosion,\r\nif there has been one, has produced singular effects! It has split the\r\nlower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and topsides!\r\nThese great rents appear rather to have been made by a rock than by the\r\nexplosion of a powder-magazine.”\r\n\r\n“There is not a rock in the channel!” answered the sailor. “I will admit\r\nanything you like, except the rock.”\r\n\r\n“Let us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig,” said the\r\nengineer; “perhaps we shall then know what to think of the cause of her\r\ndestruction.”\r\n\r\nThis was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides, to\r\ntake an inventory of all the treasures on board, and to arrange their\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nAccess to the interior of the brig was now easy. The tide was still\r\ngoing down and the deck was practicable. The ballast, composed of heavy\r\nmasses of iron, had broken through in several places. The noise of the\r\nsea could be heard as it rushed out at the holes in the hull.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced along the\r\nshattered deck. Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as they had\r\nbeen but a very short time in the water, their contents were perhaps\r\nuninjured.\r\n\r\nThey then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety. The\r\nwater would not return for several hours, and these hours must be\r\nemployed in the most profitable way. Ayrton and Pencroft had, at the\r\nentrance made in the hull, discovered tackle, which would serve to hoist\r\nup the barrels and chests. The boat received them and transported them\r\nto the shore. They took the articles as they came, intending to sort\r\nthem afterwards.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the settlers saw at once, with extreme satisfaction, that\r\nthe brig possessed a very varied cargo--an assortment of all sorts of\r\narticles, utensils, manufactured goods, and tools--such as the ships\r\nwhich make the great coasting-trade of Polynesia are usually laden with.\r\nIt was probable that they would find a little of everything, and they\r\nagreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of Lincoln\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nHowever--and Cyrus Harding observed it in silent astonishment--not only,\r\nas has been said, had the hull of the brig enormously suffered from the\r\nshock, whatever it was, that had occasioned the catastrophe, but the\r\ninterior arrangements had been destroyed, especially towards the bows.\r\nPartitions and stanchions were smashed, as if some tremendous shell had\r\nburst in the interior of the brig. The colonists could easily go fore\r\nand aft, after having removed the cases as they were extricated. They\r\nwere not heavy bales, which would have been difficult to remove,\r\nbut simple packages, of which the stowage, besides, was no longer\r\nrecognizable.\r\n\r\nThe colonists then reached the stern of the brig--the part formerly\r\nsurmounted by the poop. It was there that, following Ayrton’s\r\ndirections, they must look for the powder-magazine. Cyrus Harding\r\nthought that it had not exploded; that it was possible some barrels\r\nmight be saved, and that the powder, which is usually enclosed in metal\r\ncoverings might not have suffered from contact with the water.\r\n\r\nThis, in fact, was just what had happened. They extricated from among\r\na large number of shot twenty barrels, the insides of which were lined\r\nwith copper. Pencroft was convinced by the evidence of his own eyes that\r\nthe destruction of the “Speedy” could not be attributed to an explosion.\r\nThat part of the hull in which the magazine was situated was, moreover,\r\nthat which had suffered least.\r\n\r\n“It may be so,” said the obstinate sailor; “but as to a rock, there is\r\nnot one in the channel!”\r\n\r\n“Then, how did it happen?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered Pencroft, “Captain Harding doesn’t know, and\r\nnobody knows or ever will know!”\r\n\r\nSeveral hours had passed during these researches, and the tide began to\r\nflow. Work must be suspended for the present. There was no fear of the\r\nbrig being carried away by the sea, for she was already fixed as firmly\r\nas if moored by her anchors.\r\n\r\nThey could, therefore, without inconvenience, wait until the next day to\r\nresume operations; but, as to the vessel itself, she was doomed, and it\r\nwould be best to hasten to save the remains of her hull, as she would\r\nnot be long in disappearing in the quicksands of the channel.\r\n\r\nIt was now five o’clock in the evening. It had been a hard day’s work\r\nfor the men. They ate with good appetite, and notwithstanding their\r\nfatigue, they could not resist, after dinner, their desire of inspecting\r\nthe cases which composed the cargo of the “Speedy.”\r\n\r\nMost of them contained clothes, which, as may be believed, was well\r\nreceived. There were enough to clothe a whole colony--linen for every\r\none’s use, shoes for every one’s feet.\r\n\r\n“We are too rich!” exclaimed Pencroft, “But what are we going to do with\r\nall this?”\r\n\r\nAnd every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he\r\ncaught sight of the barrels of gunpowder, firearms and sidearms,\r\nballs of cotton, implements of husbandry, carpenter’s, joiner’s, and\r\nblacksmith’s tools, and boxes of all kinds of seeds, not in the least\r\ninjured by their short sojourn in the water. Ah, two years before,\r\nhow these things would have been prized! And now, even though the\r\nindustrious colonists had provided themselves with tools, these\r\ntreasures would find their use.\r\n\r\nThere was no want of space in the store-rooms of Granite House, but that\r\ndaytime would not allow them to stow away the whole. It would not do\r\nalso to forget that the six survivors of the “Speedy’s” crew had landed\r\non the island, for they were in all probability scoundrels of the\r\ndeepest dye, and it was necessary that the colonists should be on their\r\nguard against them. Although the bridges over the Mercy were raised,\r\nthe convicts would not be stopped by a river or a stream and, rendered\r\ndesperate, these wretches would be capable of anything.\r\n\r\nThey would see later what plan it would be best to follow; but in the\r\nmeantime it was necessary to mount guard over cases and packages heaped\r\nup near the Chimneys, and thus the settlers employed themselves in turn\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nThe morning came, however, without the convicts having attempted any\r\nattack. Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite House, would\r\nhave quickly given the alarm. The three following days--the 19th, 20th,\r\nand 21st of October--were employed in saving everything of value, or of\r\nany use whatever, either from the cargo or rigging of the brig. At low\r\ntide they overhauled the hold--at high tide they stowed away the rescued\r\narticles. A great part of the copper sheathing had been torn from the\r\nhull, which every day sank lower. But before the sand had swallowed the\r\nheavy things which had fallen through the bottom, Ayrton and Pencroft,\r\ndiving to the bed of the channel, recovered the chains and anchors of\r\nthe brig, the iron of her ballast, and even four guns, which, floated by\r\nmeans of empty casks, were brought to shore.\r\n\r\nIt may be seen that the arsenal of the colony had gained by the\r\nwreck, as well as the storerooms of Granite House. Pencroft, always\r\nenthusiastic in his projects, already spoke of constructing a battery\r\nto command the channel and the mouth of the river. With four guns,\r\nhe engaged to prevent any fleet, “however powerful it might be,” from\r\nventuring into the waters of Lincoln Island!\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, when nothing remained of the brig but a useless hulk,\r\nbad weather came on, which soon finished her. Cyrus Harding had intended\r\nto blow her up, so as to collect the remains on the shore, but a strong\r\ngale from the northeast and a heavy sea compelled him to economize his\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nIn fact, on the night of the 23rd, the hull entirely broke up, and some\r\nof the wreck was cast up on the beach.\r\n\r\nAs to the papers on board, it is useless to say that, although he\r\ncarefully searched the lockers of the poop, Harding did not discover\r\nany trace of them. The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that\r\nconcerned either the captain or the owners of the “Speedy,” and, as the\r\nname of her port was not painted on her counter, there was nothing which\r\nwould tell them her nationality. However, by the shape of her boats\r\nAyrton and Pencroft believed that the brig was of English build.\r\n\r\nA week after the castrophe--or, rather, after the fortunate, though\r\ninexplicable, event to which the colony owed its preservation--nothing\r\nmore could be seen of the vessel, even at low tide. The wreck had\r\ndisappeared, and Granite House was enriched by nearly all it had\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nHowever, the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would\r\ndoubtless never have been cleared away if, on the 30th of November, Neb,\r\nstrolling on the beach, had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder,\r\nbearing traces of explosion. The edges of this cylinder were twisted and\r\nbroken, as if they had been subjected to the action of some explosive\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nNeb brought this piece of metal to his master, who was then occupied\r\nwith his companions in the workshop of the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding examined the cylinder attentively, then, turning to\r\nPencroft,--\r\n\r\n“You persist, my friend,” said he, “in maintaining that the ‘Speedy’ was\r\nnot lost in consequence of a collision?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, captain,” answered the sailor. “You know as well as I do that\r\nthere are no rocks in the channel.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?” said the engineer,\r\nshowing the broken cylinder.\r\n\r\n“What, that bit of pipe!” exclaimed Pencroft in a tone of perfect\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” resumed Harding, “you remember that before she foundered\r\nthe brig rose on the summit of a regular waterspout?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, captain,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout? It was\r\nthis,” said the engineer, holding up the broken tube.\r\n\r\n“That?” returned Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Yes! This cylinder is all that remains of a torpedo!”\r\n\r\n“A torpedo!” exclaimed the engineer’s companions.\r\n\r\n“And who put the torpedo there?” demanded Pencroft, who did not like to\r\nyield.\r\n\r\n“All that I can tell you is, that it was not I,” answered Cyrus Harding;\r\n“but it was there, and you have been able to judge of its incomparable\r\npower!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nSo, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo.\r\nCyrus Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of the Union,\r\nhe had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction. It\r\nwas under the action of this cylinder, charged with some explosive\r\nsubstance, nitro-glycerine, picrate, or some other material of the same\r\nnature, that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome, the\r\nbottom of the brig crushed in, and she had sunk instantly, the damage\r\ndone to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat\r\nher. The “Speedy” had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would\r\nhave destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing-boat!\r\n\r\nYes! all was explained, everything--except the presence of the torpedo\r\nin the waters of the channel!\r\n\r\n“My friends, then,” said Cyrus Harding, “we can no longer be in doubt\r\nas to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps,\r\nabandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be\r\nacquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these\r\ntwo years. Who this beneficent stranger is, whose intervention has, so\r\nfortunately for us, been manifested on many occasions, I cannot imagine.\r\nWhat his object can be in acting thus, in concealing himself after\r\nrendering us so many services, I cannot understand: But his services are\r\nnot the less real, and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of\r\nprodigious power, could render them. Ayrton is indebted to him as much\r\nas we are, for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after\r\nthe fall from the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document,\r\nwho placed the bottle in the channel, and who has made known to us the\r\nsituation of our companion. I will add that it was he who guided that\r\nchest, provided with everything we wanted, and stranded it on Flotsam\r\nPoint; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the\r\nisland, which permitted you to land; that it was he who fired that\r\nbullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was he who plunged that\r\ntorpedo into the channel, which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all\r\nthose inexplicable events, for which we could not assign a reason, are\r\ndue to this mysterious being. Therefore, whoever he may be, whether\r\nshipwrecked, or exiled on our island, we shall be ungrateful, if we\r\nthink ourselves freed from gratitude towards him. We have contracted a\r\ndebt, and I hope that we shall one day pay it.”\r\n\r\n“You are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus,” replied Gideon Spilett.\r\n“Yes, there is an almost all-powerful being, hidden in some part of the\r\nisland, and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony.\r\nI will add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which\r\nborder on the supernatural, if in the events of practical life the\r\nsupernatural were recognizable. Is it he who is in secret communication\r\nwith us by the well in Granite House, and has he thus a knowledge of all\r\nour plans? Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her\r\nfirst cruise? Was it he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed the\r\ndugong? Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from\r\nthe waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not\r\nhave been able to act? If it was he, he possesses a power which renders\r\nhim master of the elements.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter’s reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be so.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” rejoined Cyrus Harding, “if the intervention of a human being is\r\nnot more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means\r\nof action beyond those possessed by humanity. There is a mystery still,\r\nbut if we discover the man, the mystery will be discovered also. The\r\nquestion, then, is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous\r\nbeing, or ought we to do everything to find him out? What is your\r\nopinion on the matter?”\r\n\r\n“My opinion,” said Pencroft, “is that, whoever he may be, he is a brave\r\nman, and he has my esteem!”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” answered Harding, “but that is not an answer, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“Master,” then said Neb, “my idea is, that we may search as long as we\r\nlike for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that we shall\r\nnot discover him till he pleases.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not bad, what you say, Neb,” observed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“I am of Neb’s opinion,” said Gideon Spilett, “but that is no reason for\r\nnot attempting the adventure. Whether we find this mysterious being or\r\nnot, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him.”\r\n\r\n“And you, my boy, give us your opinion,” said the engineer, turning to\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, “how I should\r\nlike to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now saved us!”\r\n\r\n“Of course, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “so would I and all of us. I am\r\nnot inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see this individual\r\nface to face! It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall, strong,\r\nwith a splendid beard, radiant hair, and that he must be seated on\r\nclouds, a great ball in his hands!”\r\n\r\n“But, Pencroft,” answered Spilett, “you are describing a picture of the\r\nCreator.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “but that is how I imagine\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\n“And you, Ayrton?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, “I can give you no better advice in\r\nthis matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish me to join you\r\nin your researches, I am ready to follow you.\r\n\r\n“I thank you, Ayrton,” answered Cyrus Harding, “but I should like a more\r\ndirect answer to the question I put to you. You are our companion; you\r\nhave already endangered your life several times for us, and you, as\r\nwell as the rest, ought to be consulted in the matter of any important\r\ndecision. Speak, therefore.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, “I think that we ought to do\r\neverything to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is alone.\r\nPerhaps he is suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be renewed. I, too,\r\nas you said, have a debt of gratitude to pay him. It was he, it could be\r\nonly he who must have come to Tabor Island, who found there the wretch\r\nyou knew, and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man\r\nthere to be saved. Therefore it is, thanks to him, that I have become a\r\nman again. No, I will never forget him!”\r\n\r\n“That is settled, then,” said Cyrus Harding. “We will begin our\r\nresearches as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the island\r\nunexplored. We will search into its most secret recesses, and will\r\nhope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our\r\nintentions!”\r\n\r\nFor several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and\r\nthe harvest. Before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown\r\nparts of the island into execution, they wished to get all possible work\r\nfinished. It was also the time for collecting the various vegetables\r\nfrom the Tabor Island plants. All was stowed away, and happily there was\r\nno want of room in Granite House, in which they might have housed all\r\nthe treasures of the island. The products of the colony were there,\r\nmethodically arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed,\r\nsheltered as much from animals as from man.\r\n\r\nThere was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite.\r\nMany natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged\r\neither by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus became a general\r\nwarehouse, containing all the provisions, arms, tools, and spare\r\nutensils--in a word, all the stores of the colony.\r\n\r\nAs to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces of\r\nordnance, which, at Pencroft’s entreaty, were hoisted by means of tackle\r\nand pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were made between\r\nthe windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen\r\nthrough the granite cliff. From this height they commanded all Union\r\nBay. It was like a little Gibraltar, and any vessel anchored off the\r\nislet would inevitably be exposed to the fire of this aerial battery.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November, “now that\r\nour fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing if we tried\r\nthe range of our guns.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that is useful?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“It is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are we to\r\nknow to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we\r\nare provided?”\r\n\r\n“Try them, Pencroft,” replied the engineer. “However, I think that in\r\nmaking the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder,\r\nthe supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle\r\nwhich will never fail us.”\r\n\r\n“Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?” asked the reporter,\r\nwho was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n“I believe so. However,” added the engineer, “we will be prudent.” The\r\nengineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make.\r\nMade of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they ought consequently to be\r\nable to bear a considerable charge, and also have an enormous range.\r\nIn fact, as regards practical effect, the transit described by the ball\r\nought to be as extended as possible, and this tension could only be\r\nobtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with\r\na very great initial velocity.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Harding to his companions, “the initial velocity is in\r\nproportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of\r\nthese pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the highest\r\npossible power of resistance, and steel is incontestably that metal of\r\nall others which resists the best. I have, therefore, reason to believe\r\nthat our guns will bear without risk the expansion of the pyroxyle gas,\r\nand will give excellent results.”\r\n\r\n“We shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them!”\r\n answered Pencroft.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order.\r\nSince they had been taken from the water, the sailor had bestowed great\r\ncare upon them. How many hours he had spent, in rubbing, greasing, and\r\npolishing them, and in cleaning the mechanism! And now the pieces were\r\nas brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the United States\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nOn this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the colony,\r\nincluding Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were successively tried.\r\nThey were charged with pyroxyle, taking into consideration its explosive\r\npower, which, as has been said, is four times that of ordinary powder:\r\nthe projectile to be fired was cylindroconic.\r\n\r\nPencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to fire.\r\n\r\nAt Harding’s signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet,\r\nfell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with\r\nexactitude.\r\n\r\nThe second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and\r\nthe shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House,\r\nmade it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and\r\nfired it, and very proud he was of his first shot. Pencroft only was\r\nprouder than he! Such a shot, the honor of which belonged to his dear\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nThe third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side\r\nof Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having\r\nricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly increased the charge, so\r\nas to try its extreme range. Then, all standing aside for fear of its\r\nbursting, the match was lighted by means of a long cord.\r\n\r\nA tremendous report was heard, but the piece had held good, and the\r\ncolonists rushing to the windows, saw the shot graze the rocks of\r\nMandible Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and disappear in\r\nShark Gulf.\r\n\r\n“Well, captain,” exclaimed Pencroft, whose cheers might have rivaled the\r\nreports themselves, “what do you say of our battery? All the pirates in\r\nthe Pacific have only to present themselves before Granite House! Not\r\none can land there now without our permission!”\r\n\r\n“Believe me, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “it would be better not to\r\nhave to make the experiment.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the sailor, “what ought to be done with regard to those\r\nsix villains who are roaming about the island? Are we to leave them\r\nto overrun our forests, our fields, our plantations? These pirates are\r\nregular jaguars, and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat\r\nthem as such! What do you think, Ayrton?” added Pencroft, turning to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nAyrton hesitated at first to reply, and Cyrus Harding regretted that\r\nPencroft had so thoughtlessly put this question. And he was much moved\r\nwhen Ayrton replied in a humble tone,--\r\n\r\n“I have been one of those jaguars, Mr. Pencroft. I have no right to\r\nspeak.”\r\n\r\nAnd with a slow step he walked away.\r\n\r\nPencroft understood.\r\n\r\n“What a brute I am!” he exclaimed. “Poor Ayrton! He has as much right to\r\nspeak here as any one!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Gideon Spilett, “but his reserve does him honor, and it is\r\nright to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Mr. Spilett,” answered the sailor, “and there is no fear of\r\nmy doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than cause Ayrton\r\nany pain! But to return to the question. It seems to me that these\r\nruffians have no right to any pity, and that we ought to rid the island\r\nof them as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Is that your opinion, Pencroft?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Quite my opinion.”\r\n\r\n“And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had\r\ncommitted some fresh act of hostility against us?”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t what they have done already enough?” asked Pencroft, who did not\r\nunderstand these scruples.\r\n\r\n“They may adopt other sentiments!” said Harding, “and perhaps repent.”\r\n\r\n“They repent!” exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Pencroft, think of Ayrton!” said Herbert, taking the sailor’s hand. “He\r\nbecame an honest man again!”\r\n\r\nPencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had never\r\nthought of his proposal being met with any objection. His rough nature\r\ncould not allow that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who\r\nhad landed on the island with Bob Harvey’s accomplices, the murderers of\r\nthe crew of the “Speedy,” and he looked upon them as wild beasts which\r\nought to be destroyed without delay and without remorse.\r\n\r\n“Come!” said be. “Everybody is against me! You wish to be generous to\r\nthose villains! Very well; I hope we mayn’t repent it!”\r\n\r\n“What danger shall we run,” said Herbert, “if we take care to be always\r\non our guard?”\r\n\r\n“Hum!” observed the reporter, who had not given any decided opinion.\r\n“They are six and well armed. If they each lay hid in a corner, and each\r\nfired at one of us, they would soon be masters of the colony!”\r\n\r\n“Why have they not done so?” said Herbert. “No doubt because it was not\r\ntheir interest to do it. Besides, we are six also.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have convinced.\r\n“Let us leave these good people to do what they like, and don’t think\r\nanything more about them!”\r\n\r\n“Come, Pencroft,” said Neb, “don’t make yourself out so bad as all that!\r\nSuppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you, within good\r\nrange of your guns, you would not fire.”\r\n\r\n“I would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb,” replied Pencroft\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” said the engineer, “you have always shown much deference to\r\nmy advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?”\r\n\r\n“I will do as you please, Captain Harding,” answered the sailor, who was\r\nnot at all convinced.\r\n\r\n“Very well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are attacked\r\nfirst.”\r\n\r\nThus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon, although\r\nPencroft augured nothing good from it. They were not to attack them, but\r\nwere to be on their guard. After all, the island was large and fertile.\r\nIf any sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts,\r\nthese wretches might perhaps be reclaimed. Was it not their interest in\r\nthe situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life? At\r\nany rate, for humanity’s sake alone, it would be right to wait. The\r\ncolonists would no longer as before, be able to go and come without\r\nfear. Hitherto they had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six\r\nconvicts of the worst description, perhaps, were roaming over their\r\nisland. It was serious, certainly, and to less brave men, it would have\r\nbeen security lost! No matter! At present, the colonists had reason on\r\ntheir side against Pencroft. Would they be right in the future? That\r\nremained to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nHowever, the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete\r\nexploration of the island which had been decided upon, and which would\r\nhave two objects: to discover the mysterious being whose existence was\r\nnow indisputable, and at the same time to find out what had become of\r\nthe pirates, what retreat they had chosen, what sort of life they were\r\nleading, and what was to be feared from them. Cyrus Harding wished\r\nto set out without delay; but as the expedition would be of some days\r\nduration, it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and\r\ntools in order to facilitate the organization of the encampments. One\r\nof the onagers, however, having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed\r\nat present, and a few days’ rest was necessary. The departure was,\r\ntherefore, put off for a week, until the 20th of November. The month\r\nof November in this latitude corresponds to the month of May in the\r\nnorthern zones. It was, therefore, the fine season. The sun was entering\r\nthe tropic of Capricorn, and gave the longest days in the year. The time\r\nwas, therefore, very favorable for the projected expedition, which,\r\nif it did not accomplish its principal object, would at any rate be\r\nfruitful in discoveries, especially of natural productions, since\r\nHarding proposed to explore those dense forests of the Far West, which\r\nstretched to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.\r\n\r\nDuring the nine days which preceded their departure, it was agreed that\r\nthe work on Prospect Heights should be finished off.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral, where the\r\ndomesticated animals required his care. It was decided that he should\r\nspend two days there, and return to Granite House after having liberally\r\nsupplied the stables.\r\n\r\nAs he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one\r\nof them to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than\r\nformerly. Ayrton replied that this was unnecessary, as he was enough\r\nfor the work, and that besides he apprehended no danger. If anything\r\noccurred at the corral, or in the neighborhood, he could instantly warn\r\nthe colonists by sending a telegram to Granite House.\r\n\r\nAyrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one onager,\r\nand two hours after, the electric wire announced that he had found all\r\nin order at the corral.\r\n\r\nDuring these two days Harding busied himself in executing a project\r\nwhich would completely guard Granite House against any surprise. It was\r\nnecessary to completely conceal the opening of the old outlet, which\r\nwas already walled up and partly hidden under grass and plants, at the\r\nsouthern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing was easier, since if the level\r\nof the lake was raised two or three feet, the opening would be quite\r\nbeneath it. Now, to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at\r\nthe two openings made by the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine\r\nand Falls River.\r\n\r\nThe colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides did not\r\nexceed eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly erected by\r\nmeans of well-cemented blocks of stone.\r\n\r\nThis work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that at that\r\npart of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage through which the\r\noverflow of the lake formerly escaped.\r\n\r\nOf course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite House and\r\nworked the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the water could not\r\nfail. The lift once raised, this sure and comfortable retreat would be\r\nsafe from any surprise.\r\n\r\nThis work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and\r\nHerbert found time to make an expedition to Port Balloon, The sailor was\r\nvery anxious to know if the little creek in which the “Bonadventure” was\r\nmoored, had been visited by the convicts.\r\n\r\n“These gentlemen,” he observed, “landed on the south coast, and if they\r\nfollowed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have discovered the\r\nlittle harbor, and in that case, I wouldn’t give half-a-dollar for our\r\n‘Bonadventure.’”\r\n\r\nPencroft’s apprehensions were not without foundation, and a visit\r\nto Port Balloon appeared to be very desirable. The sailor and his\r\ncompanions set off on the 10th of November, after dinner, well armed.\r\nPencroft, ostentatiously slipping two bullets into each barrel of his\r\nrifle, shook his head in a way which betokened nothing good to any one\r\nwho approached too near him, whether “man or beast,” as he said. Gideon\r\nSpilett and Herbert also took their guns, and about three o’clock all\r\nthree left Granite House.\r\n\r\nNeb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they had\r\ncrossed, he raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot should\r\nannounce the colonists’ return, and that at the signal Neb should return\r\nand reestablish the communication between the two banks of the river.\r\n\r\nThe little band advanced directly along the road which led to the\r\nsouthern coast of the island. This was only a distance of three miles\r\nand a half, but Gideon Spilett and his companions took two hours to\r\ntraverse it. They examined all the border of the road, the thick forest,\r\nas well as Tabor Marsh. They found no trace of the fugitives who, no\r\ndoubt, not having yet discovered the number of the colonists, or the\r\nmeans of defense which they had at their disposal, had gained the less\r\naccessible parts of the island.\r\n\r\nArrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that\r\nthe “Bonadventure” was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek. However,\r\nPort Balloon was so well hidden among high rocks, that it could scarcely\r\nbe discovered either from the land or the sea.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Pencroft, “the blackguards have not been there yet. Long\r\ngrass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in the Far\r\nWest.”\r\n\r\n“And it’s very lucky, for if they had found the ‘Bonadventure’,” added\r\nHerbert, “they would have gone off in her, and we should have been\r\nprevented from returning to Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” remarked the reporter, “it will be important to take a\r\ndocument there which will make known the situation of Lincoln Island,\r\nand Ayrton’s new residence, in case the Scotch yacht returns to fetch\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the ‘Bonadventure’ is always there, Mr. Spilett,” answered the\r\nsailor. “She and her crew are ready to start at a moment’s notice!”\r\n\r\n“I think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our\r\nexploration of the island is finished. It is possible after all that the\r\nstranger, if we manage to find him, may know as much about Tabor Island\r\nas about Lincoln Island. Do not forget that he is certainly the author\r\nof the document, and he may, perhaps, know how far we may count on the\r\nreturn of the yacht!”\r\n\r\n“But!” exclaimed Pencroft, “who in the world can he be? The fellow knows\r\nus and we know nothing about him! If he is a simple castaway, why should\r\nhe conceal himself! We are honest men, I suppose, and the society of\r\nhonest men isn’t unpleasant to any one. Did he come here voluntarily?\r\nCan he leave the island if he likes? Is he here still? Will he remain\r\nany longer?”\r\n\r\nChatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on board and\r\nlooked about the deck of the “Bonadventure.” All at once, the sailor\r\nhaving examined the bitts to which the cable of the anchor was\r\nsecured,--\r\n\r\n“Hallo,” he cried, “this is queer!”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Pencroft?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“The matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!”\r\n\r\nAnd Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt itself.\r\n\r\n“What, it was not you?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No! I can swear to it. This is a reef knot, and I always make a running\r\nbowline.”\r\n\r\n“You must be mistaken, Pencroft.”\r\n\r\n“I am not mistaken!” declared the sailor. “My hand does it so naturally,\r\nand one’s hand is never mistaken!”\r\n\r\n“Then can the convicts have been on board?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I know nothing about that,” answered Pencroft, “but what is certain,\r\nis that some one has weighed the ‘Bonadventure’s’ anchor and dropped it\r\nagain! And look here, here is another proof! The cable of the anchor has\r\nbeen run out, and its service is no longer at the hawse-hole. I repeat\r\nthat some one has been using our vessel!”\r\n\r\n“But if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or\r\nrather gone off with her.”\r\n\r\n“Gone off! where to--to Tabor Island?” replied Pencroft. “Do you think,\r\nthey would risk themselves in a boat of such small tonnage?”\r\n\r\n“We must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet,” rejoined the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\n“However that may be,” said the sailor, “as sure as my name is\r\nBonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our ‘Bonadventure’ has sailed\r\nwithout us!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert could\r\ndispute his statement. It was evident that the vessel had been moved,\r\nmore or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon. As to the\r\nsailor, he had not the slightest doubt that the anchor had been raised\r\nand then dropped again. Now, what was the use of these two maneuvers,\r\nunless the vessel had been employed in some expedition?\r\n\r\n“But how was it we did not see the ‘Bonadventure’ pass in the sight of\r\nthe island?” observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward\r\nevery possible objection.\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “they would only have to start\r\nin the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of sight of the\r\nisland in two hours.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” resumed Gideon Spilett, “I ask again, what object could the\r\nconvicts have had in using the ‘Bonadventure,’ and why, after they had\r\nmade use of her, should they have brought her back to port?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “we must put that among the\r\nunaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The chief\r\nthing is that the ‘Bonadventure’ was there, and she is there now. Only,\r\nunfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time, we shall very\r\nlikely not find her again in her place!”\r\n\r\n“Then, Pencroft,” said Herbert, “would it not be wisest to bring the\r\n‘Bonadventure’ off to Granite House?”\r\n\r\n“Yes and no,” answered Pencroft, “or rather no. The mouth of the Mercy\r\nis a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there.”\r\n\r\n“But by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the Chimneys?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps yes,” replied Pencroft. “At any rate, since we must leave\r\nGranite House for a long expedition, I think the ‘Bonadventure’ will be\r\nsafer here during our absence, and we shall do best to leave her here\r\nuntil the island is rid of these blackguards.”\r\n\r\n“That is exactly my opinion,” said the reporter. “At any rate in the\r\nevent of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would be at\r\nthe mouth of the Mercy.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose the convicts pay her another visit,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “not finding her here, they would not\r\nbe long in finding her on the sands of Granite House, and, during our\r\nabsence, nothing could hinder them from seizing her! I agree, therefore,\r\nwith Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in Port Balloon. But, if on our\r\nreturn we have not rid the island of those rascals, it will be prudent\r\nto bring our boat to Granite House, until the time when we need not fear\r\nany unpleasant visits.”\r\n\r\n“That’s settled. Let us be off,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\nPencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to Granite House,\r\ntold the engineer all that had passed, and the latter approved of their\r\narrangements both for the present and the future. He also promised the\r\nsailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the\r\nislet and the coast, so as to ascertain if it would not be possible\r\nto make an artificial harbor there by means of dams. In this way, the\r\n“Bonadventure” would be always within reach, under the eyes of the\r\ncolonists, and if necessary, under lock and key.\r\n\r\nThat evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to bring from\r\nthe corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize to the\r\nplateau. Singularly enough, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of\r\nthe despatch, as he was accustomed to do. This could not but astonish\r\nthe engineer. But it might be that Ayrton was not at that moment in the\r\ncorral, or even that he was on his way back to Granite House. In fact,\r\ntwo days had already passed since his departure, and it had been decided\r\nthat on the evening of the 10th or at the latest the morning of the\r\n11th, he should return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to\r\nappear on Prospect Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge\r\nso as to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It was,\r\ntherefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an immediate\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nThe bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute.\r\n\r\nThe colonists’ uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was Ayrton no\r\nlonger at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no longer control\r\nover his movements? Could they go to the corral in this dark night?\r\n\r\nThey consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Herbert, “perhaps some accident has happened to the\r\ntelegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Wait till to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding. “It is possible, indeed,\r\nthat Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we have not\r\nreceived his.”\r\n\r\nThey waited, of course not without some anxiety.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the electric\r\ncurrent along the wire and received no reply.\r\n\r\nHe tried again: the same result.\r\n\r\n“Off to the corral,” said he.\r\n\r\n“And well armed!” added Pencroft.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left alone\r\nand that Neb should remain there. After having accompanied his friends\r\nto Creek Glycerine, he raised the bridge; and waiting behind a tree he\r\nwatched for the return of either his companions or Ayrton.\r\n\r\nIn the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting to\r\nforce the passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on them,\r\nand as a last resource he was to take refuge in Granite House, where,\r\nthe lift once raised, he would be in safety.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to repair\r\nto the corral, and if they did not find Ayrton, search the neighboring\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions\r\nhad passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself behind a small mound\r\ncrowned by several dragon trees, on the left bank of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights,\r\nimmediately took the road to the corral. They shouldered their guns,\r\nready to fire on the slightest hostile demonstration. The two rifles and\r\nthe two guns had been loaded with ball.\r\n\r\nThe wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have\r\nconcealed the convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been\r\nreally formidable.\r\n\r\nThe colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them,\r\nsometimes running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the wood,\r\nbut always quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual. And\r\nthey could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be\r\nsurprised, but would bark at the least appearance of danger.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which\r\nconnected the corral with Granite House. After walking for nearly two\r\nmiles, they had not as yet discovered any explanation of the difficulty.\r\nThe posts were in good order, the wire regularly extended. However, at\r\nthat moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack,\r\nand on arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped,\r\nexclaiming,--\r\n\r\n“The wire is broken!”\r\n\r\nHis companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad\r\nwas standing. The post was rooted up and lying across the path. The\r\nunexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was evident\r\nthat the despatches from Granite House had not been received at the\r\ncorral, nor those from the corral at Granite House.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t the wind that blew down this post,” observed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Gideon Spilett. “The earth has been dug up round its foot,\r\nand it has been torn up by the hand of man.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, the wire is broken,” added Herbert, showing that the wire had\r\nbeen snapped.\r\n\r\n“Is the fracture recent?” asked Harding.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Herbert, “it has certainly been done quite lately.”\r\n\r\n“To the corral! to the corral!” exclaimed the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were now half way between Granite House and the corral,\r\nhaving still two miles and a half to go. They pressed forward with\r\nredoubled speed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had occurred in\r\nthe corral. No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not\r\narrived, but this was not the reason why his companions were so uneasy,\r\nfor, a more unaccountable circumstance, Ayrton, who had promised to\r\nreturn the evening before, had not reappeared. In short, it was not\r\nwithout a motive that all communication had been stopped between the\r\ncorral and Granite House, and who but the convicts could have any\r\ninterest in interrupting this communication?\r\n\r\nThe settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety. They were\r\nsincerely attached to their new companion. Were they to find him struck\r\ndown by the hands of those of whom he was formerly the leader?\r\n\r\nSoon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side of the\r\nlittle stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered the meadows\r\nof the corral. They then moderated their pace so that they should not\r\nbe out of breath at the moment when a struggle might be necessary. Their\r\nguns were in their hands ready cocked. The forest was watched on every\r\nside. Top uttered sullen groans which were rather ominous.\r\n\r\nAt last the palisade appeared through the trees. No trace of any damage\r\ncould be seen. The gate was shut as usual. Deep silence reigned in the\r\ncorral. Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor Ayrton’s voice\r\ncould be heard.\r\n\r\n“Let us enter,” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nAnd the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch about\r\ntwenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment’s notice.\r\n\r\nHarding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push it\r\nback, when Top barked loudly. A report sounded and was responded to by a\r\ncry of pain.\r\n\r\nHerbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Herbert’s cry, Pencroft, letting his gun fall, rushed towards him.\r\n\r\n“They have killed him!” he cried. “My boy! They have killed him!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ran to Herbert.\r\n\r\nThe reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad’s heart was still\r\nbeating.\r\n\r\n“He lives,” said he, “but he must be carried--”\r\n\r\n“To Granite House? that is impossible!” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Into the corral, then!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“In a moment,” said Harding.\r\n\r\nAnd he ran round the left corner of the palisade. There he found a\r\nconvict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. In a few\r\nseconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he fell,\r\nstruck to the heart by Harding’s dagger, more sure even than his gun.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over\r\nthe palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down the props which\r\nsupported the inner door, ran into the empty house, and soon, poor\r\nHerbert was lying on Ayrton’s bed. In a few moments, Harding was by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nOn seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor’s grief was terrible.\r\n\r\nHe sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the wall.\r\n\r\nNeither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They themselves\r\nwere choked with emotion. They could not speak.\r\n\r\nHowever, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death the\r\npoor boy who was suffering beneath their eyes. Gideon Spilett had not\r\npassed through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered\r\nwithout acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine. He knew a little\r\nof everything, and several times he had been obliged to attend to wounds\r\nproduced either by a sword-bayonet or shot. Assisted by Cyrus Harding,\r\nhe proceeded to render the aid Herbert required.\r\n\r\nThe reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in which\r\nHerbert lay, a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to the shock,\r\nthe ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to produce a violent\r\nconcussion.\r\n\r\nHerbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett only felt\r\nit beat at long intervals, as if it was on the point of stopping.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms were very serious.\r\n\r\nHerbert’s chest was laid bare, and the blood having been stanched with\r\nhandkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water.\r\n\r\nThe contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,--an oval below the\r\nchest between the third and fourth ribs. It was there that Herbert had\r\nbeen hit by the bullet.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over; as they\r\ndid so, he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his\r\nlast sigh.\r\n\r\nHerberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound, by\r\nwhich the ball had immediately escaped.\r\n\r\n“God be praised!” said the reporter, “the ball is not in the body, and\r\nwe shall not have to extract it.”\r\n\r\n“But the heart?” asked Harding.\r\n\r\n“The heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would be dead!”\r\n\r\n“Dead!” exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan.\r\n\r\nThe sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter.\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding, “no! He is not dead. His pulse\r\nstill beats. He has even uttered a moan. But for your boy’s sake, calm\r\nyourself. We have need of all our self-possession.”\r\n\r\n“Do not make us lose it, my friend.”\r\n\r\nPencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears rolled down\r\nhis cheeks.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his ideas, and\r\nproceed methodically. After his examination he had no doubt that the\r\nball, entering in front, between the seventh and eighth ribs, had issued\r\nbehind between the third and fourth. But what mischief had the ball\r\ncommitted in its passage? What important organs had been reached? A\r\nprofessional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at\r\nonce, and still more so the reporter.\r\n\r\nHowever, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to prevent the\r\ninflammatory strangulation of the injured parts, then to contend with\r\nthe local inflammation and fever which would result from the wound,\r\nperhaps mortal! Now, what styptics, what antiphlogistics ought to be\r\nemployed? By what means could inflammation be prevented?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds should\r\nbe dressed without delay. It did not appear necessary to Gideon Spilett\r\nthat a fresh flow of blood should be caused by bathing them in tepid\r\nwater, and compressing their lips. The hemorrhage had been very\r\nabundant, and Herbert was already too much enfeebled by the loss of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds\r\nwith cold water.\r\n\r\nHerbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“He must not be moved.” said Gideon Spilett. “He is in the most\r\nfavorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to suppurate\r\neasily, and absolute rest is necessary.”\r\n\r\n“What! can’t we carry him to Granite House?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\n“I’ll pay the villains off!” cried the sailor, shaking his fist in a\r\nmenacing manner.\r\n\r\n“Pencroft!” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy. Herbert\r\nwas still so frightfully pale, that the reporter felt anxious.\r\n\r\n“Cyrus,” said he, “I am not a surgeon. I am in terrible perplexity. You\r\nmust aid me with your advice, your experience!”\r\n\r\n“Take courage, my friend,” answered the engineer, pressing the\r\nreporter’s hand. “Judge coolly. Think only of this: Herbert must be\r\nsaved!”\r\n\r\nThese words restored to Gideon Spilett that self-possession which he had\r\nlost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility.\r\nHe seated himself close to the bed. Cyrus Harding stood near. Pencroft\r\nhad torn up his shirt, and was mechanically making lint.\r\n\r\nSpilett then explained to Cyrus Harding that he thought he ought first\r\nof all to stop the hemorrhage, but not close the two wounds, or cause\r\ntheir immediate cicatrization, for there had been internal perforation,\r\nand the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest.\r\n\r\nHarding approved entirely, and it was decided that the two wounds should\r\nbe dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation.\r\n\r\nAnd now did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against\r\nthe inflammation which might occur?\r\n\r\nYes. They had one, for nature had generously lavished it. They had cold\r\nwater, that is to say, the most powerful sedative that can be employed\r\nagainst inflammation of wounds, the most efficacious therapeutic agent\r\nin grave cases, and the one which is now adopted by all physicians.\r\nCold water has, moreover, the advantage of leaving the wound in absolute\r\nrest, and preserving it from all premature dressing, a considerable\r\nadvantage, since it has been found by experience that contact with the\r\nair is dangerous during the first days.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett and Cyrus Harding reasoned thus with their simple good\r\nsense, and they acted as the best surgeon would have done. Compresses\r\nof linen were applied to poor Herbert’s two wounds, and were kept\r\nconstantly wet with cold water.\r\n\r\nThe sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut, which was not wanting\r\nin things necessary for life. Maple sugar, medicinal plants, the same\r\nwhich the lad had gathered on the banks of Lake Grant, enabled them to\r\nmake some refreshing drinks, which they gave him without his taking any\r\nnotice of it. His fever was extremely high, and all that day and night\r\npassed without his becoming conscious.\r\n\r\nHerbert’s life hung on a thread, and this thread might break at any\r\nmoment. The next day, the 12th of November, the hopes of Harding and his\r\ncompanions slightly revived. Herbert had come out of his long stupor.\r\nHe opened his eyes, he recognized Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and\r\nPencroft. He uttered two or three words. He did not know what had\r\nhappened. They told him, and Spilett begged him to remain perfectly\r\nstill, telling him that his life was not in danger, and that his wounds\r\nwould heal in a few days. However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all,\r\nand the cold water with which they were constantly bathed, prevented any\r\ninflammation of the wounds. The suppuration was established in a regular\r\nway, the fever did not increase, and it might now be hoped that this\r\nterrible wound would not involve any catastrophe. Pencroft felt the\r\nswelling of his heart gradually subside. He was like a sister of mercy,\r\nlike a mother by the bed of her child.\r\n\r\nHerbert dozed again, but his sleep appeared more natural.\r\n\r\n“Tell me again that you hope, Mr. Spilett,” said Pencroft. “Tell me\r\nagain that you will save Herbert!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we will save him!” replied the reporter. “The wound is serious,\r\nand, perhaps, even the ball has traversed the lungs, but the perforation\r\nof this organ is not fatal.”\r\n\r\n“God bless you!” answered Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAs may be believed, during the four-and-twenty hours they had been in\r\nthe corral, the colonists had no other thought than that of nursing\r\nHerbert. They did not think either of the danger which threatened them\r\nshould the convicts return, or of the precautions to be taken for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nBut on this day, while Pencroft watched by the sick-bed, Cyrus Harding\r\nand the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do.\r\n\r\nFirst of all they examined the corral. There was not a trace of Ayrton.\r\nHad the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices? Had he\r\nresisted, and been overcome in the struggle? This last supposition was\r\nonly too probable. Gideon Spilett, at the moment he scaled the palisade,\r\nhad clearly seen some one of the convicts running along the southern\r\nspur of Mount Franklin, towards whom Top had sprung. It was one of those\r\nwhose object had been so completely defeated by the rocks at the mouth\r\nof the Mercy. Besides, the one killed by Harding, and whose body was\r\nfound outside the enclosure, of course belonged to Bob Harvey’s crew.\r\n\r\nAs to the corral, it had not suffered any damage. The gates were closed,\r\nand the animals had not been able to disperse in the forest. Nor could\r\nthey see traces of any struggle, any devastation, either in the hut,\r\nor in the palisade. The ammunition only, with which Ayrton had been\r\nsupplied, had disappeared with him.\r\n\r\n“The unhappy man has been surprised,” said Harding, “and as he was a man\r\nto defend himself, he must have been overpowered.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is to be feared!” said the reporter. “Then, doubtless, the\r\nconvicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of\r\neverything, and only fled when they saw us coming. It is very evident,\r\ntoo, that at this moment Ayrton, whether living or dead, is not here!”\r\n\r\n“We shall have to beat the forest,” said the engineer, “and rid the\r\nisland of these wretches. Pencroft’s presentiments were not mistaken,\r\nwhen he wished to hunt them as wild beasts. That would have spared us\r\nall these misfortunes!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the reporter, “but now we have the right to be\r\nmerciless!”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said the engineer, “we are obliged to wait some time,\r\nand to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert without danger to\r\nGranite House.”\r\n\r\n“But Neb?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Neb is in safety.”\r\n\r\n“But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?”\r\n\r\n“He must not come!” returned Cyrus Harding quickly. “He would be\r\nmurdered on the road!”\r\n\r\n“It is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin us!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned! But that is\r\nimpossible now! As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone, we could\r\nnot do it! Well, I will go alone to Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “you must not expose yourself!\r\nYour courage would be of no avail. The villains are evidently watching\r\nthe corral, they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it, and if\r\nyou go we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one!”\r\n\r\n“But Neb?” repeated the engineer. “It is now four-and-twenty hours since\r\nhe has had any news of us! He will be sure to come!”\r\n\r\n“And as he will be less on his guard than we should be ourselves,” added\r\nSpilett, “he will be killed!”\r\n\r\n“Is there really no way of warning him?”\r\n\r\nWhile the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going backwards\r\nand forwards seemed to say,--\r\n\r\n“Am not I here?”\r\n\r\n“Top!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nThe animal sprang at his master’s call.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Top will go,” said the reporter, who had understood the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Top can go where we cannot! He will carry to Granite House the news of\r\nthe corral, and he will bring back to us that from Granite House!”\r\n\r\n“Quick!” said Harding. “Quick!”\r\n\r\nSpilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note-book, and wrote these words:--\r\n\r\n“Herbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave\r\nGranite House. Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood? Reply by\r\nTop.”\r\n\r\nThis laconic note contained all that Neb ought to know, and at the same\r\ntime asked all that the colonists wished to know. It was folded and\r\nfastened to Top’s collar in a conspicuous position.\r\n\r\n“Top, my dog,” said the engineer, caressing the animal, “Neb, Top! Neb!\r\nGo, go!”\r\n\r\nTop bounded at these words. He understood, he knew what was expected of\r\nhim. The road to the corral was familiar to him. In less than an hour he\r\ncould clear it, and it might be hoped that where neither Cyrus Harding\r\nnor the reporter could have ventured without danger, Top, running among\r\nthe grass or in the wood, would pass unperceived.\r\n\r\nThe engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it.\r\n\r\n“Neb, Top! Neb!” repeated the engineer, again pointing in the direction\r\nof Granite House.\r\n\r\nTop sprang forwards, then almost immediately disappeared.\r\n\r\n“He will get there!” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and he will come back, the faithful animal!”\r\n\r\n“What o’clock is it?” asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Ten.”\r\n\r\n“In an hour he may be here. We will watch for his return.”\r\n\r\nThe gate of the corral was closed. The engineer and the reporter\r\nre-entered the house. Herbert was still in a sleep. Pencroft kept the\r\ncompresses always wet. Spilett, seeing there was nothing he could do\r\nat that moment, busied himself in preparing some nourishment, while\r\nattentively watching that part of the enclosure against the hill, at\r\nwhich an attack might be expected.\r\n\r\nThe settlers awaited Top’s return with much anxiety. A little before\r\neleven o’clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in hand, were\r\nbehind the gate, ready to open it at the first bark of their dog.\r\n\r\nThey did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite House, Neb\r\nwould have sent him back immediately.\r\n\r\nThey had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report was heard,\r\nfollowed by repeated barks.\r\n\r\nThe engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the\r\nwood, he fired in that direction.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was quickly\r\nshut.\r\n\r\n“Top, Top!” exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog’s great honest head\r\nbetween his hands.\r\n\r\nA note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these words,\r\ntraced in Neb’s large writing:--“No pirates in the neighborhood of\r\nGranite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr. Herbert!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nSo the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and determined to\r\nkill the settlers one after the other. There was nothing to be done but\r\nto treat them as wild beasts. But great precautions must be taken, for\r\njust now the wretches had the advantage on their side, seeing, and not\r\nbeing seen, being able to surprise by the suddenness of their attack,\r\nyet not to be surprised themselves. Harding made arrangements,\r\ntherefore, for living in the corral, of which the provisions would last\r\nfor a tolerable length of time. Ayrton’s house had been provided with\r\nall that was necessary for existence, and the convicts, scared by\r\nthe arrival of the settlers, had not had time to pillage it. It was\r\nprobable, as Gideon Spilett observed, that things had occurred as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the southern\r\nshore, and after having traversed the double shore of the Serpentine\r\nPeninsula, not being inclined to venture into the Far West woods, they\r\nhad reached the mouth of Falls River. From this point, by following the\r\nright bank of the watercourse, they would arrive at the spurs of Mount\r\nFranklin, among which they would naturally seek a retreat, and they\r\ncould not have been long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited.\r\nThere they had regularly installed themselves, awaiting the moment\r\nto put their abominable schemes into execution. Ayrton’s arrival had\r\nsurprised them, but they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man,\r\nand--the rest may be easily imagined!\r\n\r\nNow, the convicts,--reduced to five, it is true, but well armed,--were\r\nroaming the woods, and to venture there was to expose themselves to\r\ntheir attacks, which could be neither guarded against nor prevented.\r\n\r\n“Wait! There is nothing else to be done!” repeated Cyrus Harding. “When\r\nHerbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and\r\nhave satisfaction of these convicts. That will be the object of our\r\ngrand expedition at the same time--”\r\n\r\n“As the search for our mysterious protector,” added Gideon Spilett,\r\nfinishing the engineer’s sentence. “And it must be acknowledged, my dear\r\nCyrus, that this time his protection was wanting at the very moment when\r\nit was most necessary to us!”\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“That we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett,\r\nand that his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of\r\nexercising itself. But that is not the question now. Herbert’s life\r\nbefore everything.”\r\n\r\nThis was the colonists’ saddest thought. Several days passed, and the\r\npoor boy’s state was happily no worse. Cold water, always kept at a\r\nsuitable temperature, had completely prevented the inflammation of the\r\nwounds. It even seemed to the reporter that this water, being slightly\r\nsulphurous,--which was explained by the neighborhood of the volcano,\r\nhad a more direct action on the healing. The suppuration was much\r\nless abundant, and thanks to the incessant care by which he was\r\nsurrounded!--Herbert returned to life, and his fever abated. He was\r\nbesides subjected to a severe diet, and consequently his weakness was\r\nand would be extreme; but there was no want of refreshing drinks, and\r\nabsolute rest was of the greatest benefit to him. Cyrus Harding, Gideon\r\nSpilett, and Pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the lad’s\r\nwounds. All the linen in the house had been sacrificed. Herbert’s\r\nwounds, covered with compresses and lint, were pressed neither too much\r\nnor too little, so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting any\r\ninflammatory reaction. The reporter used extreme care in the dressing,\r\nknowing well the importance of it, and repeating to his companions that\r\nwhich most surgeons willingly admit, that it is perhaps rarer to see a\r\ndressing well done than an operation well performed.\r\n\r\nIn ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably better.\r\nHe had begun to take some nourishment.\r\n\r\nThe color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes smiled at\r\nhis nurses. He talked a little, notwithstanding Pencroft’s efforts, who\r\ntalked incessantly to prevent him from beginning to speak, and told him\r\nthe most improbable stories. Herbert had questioned him on the subject\r\nof Ayrton, whom he was astonished not to see near him, thinking that\r\nhe was at the corral. But the sailor, not wishing to distress Herbert,\r\ncontented himself by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb, so as to\r\ndefend Granite House.\r\n\r\n“Humph!” said Pencroft, “these pirates! they are gentlemen who have\r\nno right to any consideration! And the captain wanted to win them by\r\nkindness! I’ll send them some kindness, but in the shape of a good\r\nbullet!”\r\n\r\n“And have they not been seen again?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy,” answered the sailor, “but we shall find them, and when\r\nyou are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from behind will\r\ndare to meet us face to face!”\r\n\r\n“I am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!”\r\n\r\n“Well! your strength will return gradually! What’s a ball through the\r\nchest? Nothing but a joke! I’ve seen many, and I don’t think much of\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\nAt last things appeared to be going on well, and if no complication\r\noccurred, Herbert’s recovery might be regarded as certain. But what\r\nwould have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been\r\naggravated,--if, for example, the ball had remained in his body, if his\r\narm or his leg had had to be amputated?\r\n\r\n“No,” said Spilett more than once, “I have never thought of such a\r\ncontingency without shuddering!”\r\n\r\n“And yet, if it had been necessary to operate,” said Harding one day to\r\nhim, “you would not have hesitated?”\r\n\r\n“No, Cyrus!” said Gideon Spilett, “but thank God that we have been\r\nspared this complication!”\r\n\r\nAs in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to the logic\r\nof that simple good sense of which they had made use so often, and once\r\nmore, thanks to their general knowledge, it had succeeded! But might not\r\na time come when all their science would be at fault? They were alone\r\non the island. Now, men in all states of society are necessary to each\r\nother. Cyrus Harding knew this well, and sometimes he asked if some\r\ncircumstance might not occur which they would be powerless to surmount.\r\nIt appeared to him besides, that he and his companions, till then so\r\nfortunate, had entered into an unlucky period. During the two years and\r\na half which had elapsed since their escape from Richmond, it might\r\nbe said that they had had everything their own way. The island had\r\nabundantly supplied them with minerals, vegetables, animals, and as\r\nNature had constantly loaded them, their science had known how to take\r\nadvantage of what she offered them.\r\n\r\nThe wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete. Moreover, in certain\r\noccurrences an inexplicable influence had come to their aid!... But all\r\nthat could only be for a time.\r\n\r\nIn short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against them.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the convicts’ ship had appeared in the waters of the island,\r\nand if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six of\r\nthem, at least, had escaped the catastrophe. They had disembarked on the\r\nisland, and it was almost impossible to get at the five who survived.\r\nAyrton had no doubt been murdered by these wretches, who possessed\r\nfirearms, and at the first use that they had made of them, Herbert had\r\nfallen, wounded almost mortally. Were these the first blows aimed by\r\nadverse fortune at the colonists? This was often asked by Harding. This\r\nwas often repeated by the reporter; and it appeared to him also that the\r\nintervention, so strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served\r\nthem so well, had now failed them. Had this mysterious being, whatever\r\nhe was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island? Had\r\nhe in his turn succumbed?\r\n\r\nNo reply was possible to these questions. But it must not be imagined\r\nthat because Harding and his companions spoke of these things, they were\r\nmen to despair. Far from that. They looked their situation in the face,\r\nthey analyzed the chances, they prepared themselves for any event, they\r\nstood firm and straight before the future, and if adversity was at last\r\nto strike them, it would find in them men prepared to struggle against\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nThe convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing. One\r\nthing only was now to be desired, that his state would allow him to be\r\nbrought to Granite House. However well built and supplied the corral\r\nhouse was, it could not be so comfortable as the healthy granite\r\ndwelling. Besides, it did not offer the same security, and its tenants,\r\nnotwithstanding their watchfulness, were here always in fear of some\r\nshot from the convicts. There, on the contrary, in the middle of that\r\nimpregnable and inaccessible cliff, they would have nothing to fear, and\r\nany attack on their persons would certainly fail. They therefore waited\r\nimpatiently for the moment when Herbert might be moved without danger\r\nfrom his wound, and they were determined to make this move, although the\r\ncommunication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.\r\n\r\nThey had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account. The\r\ncourageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite House, would\r\nnot allow himself to be surprised. Top had not been sent again to him,\r\nas it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which\r\nmight deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary.\r\n\r\nThey waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be reunited at\r\nGranite House. It pained the engineer to see his forces divided, for it\r\ngave great advantage to the pirates. Since Ayrton’s disappearance they\r\nwere only four against five, for Herbert could not yet be counted, and\r\nthis was not the least care of the brave boy, who well understood the\r\ntrouble of which he was the cause.\r\n\r\nThe question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to act\r\nagainst the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of November\r\nby Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a moment when Herbert\r\nwas asleep and could not hear them.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb and of the\r\nimpossibility of communicating with him, “I think,--like you, that to\r\nventure on the road to the corral would be to risk receiving a gunshot\r\nwithout being able to return it. But do you not think that the best\r\nthing to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?”\r\n\r\n“That is just what I was thinking,” answered Pencroft. “I believe we’re\r\nnot fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding\r\napproves, I’m ready to dash into the forest! Why, hang it, one man is\r\nequal to another!”\r\n\r\n“But is he equal to five?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“I will join Pencroft,” said the reporter, “and both of us, well-armed\r\nand accompanied by Top--”\r\n\r\n“My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft,” answered Harding, “let us reason\r\ncoolly. If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island, if we knew\r\nthat spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would undertake a direct\r\nattack; but is there not occasion to fear, on the contrary, that they\r\nare sure to fire the first shot?”\r\n\r\n“Well, captain,” cried Pencroft, “a bullet does not always reach its\r\nmark.”\r\n\r\n“That which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft,” replied the\r\nengineer. “Besides, observe that if both of you left the corral I should\r\nremain here alone to defend it. Do you imagine that the convicts will\r\nnot see you leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest,\r\nand that they will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there\r\nis no one here but a wounded boy and a man?”\r\n\r\n“You are right, captain,” replied Pencroft, his chest swelling with\r\nsullen anger. “You are right; they will do all they can to retake the\r\ncorral, which they know to be well stored; and alone you could not hold\r\nit against them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if we were only at Granite House!”\r\n\r\n“If we were at Granite House,” answered the engineer, “the case would be\r\nvery different. There I should not be afraid to leave Herbert with one,\r\nwhile the other three went to search the forests of the island. But we\r\nare at the corral, and it is best to stay here until we can leave it\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding’s reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions\r\nunderstood it well.\r\n\r\n“If only Ayrton was still one of us!” said Gideon Spilett. “Poor fellow!\r\nhis return to social life will have been but of short duration.”\r\n\r\n“If he is dead,” added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone.\r\n\r\n“Do you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared him?” asked\r\nGideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if they had any interest in doing so.”\r\n\r\n“What! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions, forgetting\r\nall that he owes us--”\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” answered the sailor, who did not hazard this shameful\r\nsupposition without hesitating.\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” said Harding, taking the sailor’s arm, “that is a wicked\r\nidea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking\r\nthus. I will answer for Ayrton’s fidelity.”\r\n\r\n“And I also,” added the reporter quickly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, captain, I was wrong,” replied Pencroft; “it was a wicked\r\nidea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it. But what can I do? I’m\r\nnot in my senses. This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly,\r\nand I have never felt so excited as I do now.\r\n\r\n“Be patient, Pencroft,” replied the engineer. “How long will it be, my\r\ndear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to Granite House?”\r\n\r\n“That is difficult to say, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “for any\r\nimprudence might involve terrible consequences. But his convalescence\r\nis progressing, and if he continues to gain strength, in eight days from\r\nnow--well, we shall see.”\r\n\r\nEight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until the\r\nfirst days of December. At this time two months of spring had already\r\npassed. The weather was fine, and the heat began to be great. The\r\nforests of the island were in full leaf, and the time was approaching\r\nwhen the usual crops ought to be gathered. The return to the plateau of\r\nProspect Heights would, therefore, be followed by extensive agricultural\r\nlabors, interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island.\r\n\r\nIt can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this seclusion in\r\nthe corral must have been to the colonists.\r\n\r\nBut if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not do so\r\nwithout impatience.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made the\r\ntour of the palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun\r\ncocked, was ready for any emergency.\r\n\r\nHe met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His dog\r\nwould have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might\r\nbe concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment at least, and\r\nthat the convicts were occupied in another part of the island.\r\n\r\nHowever, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon Spilett,\r\nwho had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods, towards the south\r\nof the mountain, remarked that Top scented something. The dog had no\r\nlonger his unconcerned manner; he went backwards and forwards, ferreting\r\namong the grass and bushes as if his smell had revealed some suspicious\r\nobject to him.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his voice,\r\nwhile keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and sheltering\r\nhimself behind the trees. It was not probable that Top scented the\r\npresence of man, for in that case, he would have announced it by\r\nhalf-uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now, as he did not growl, it was\r\nbecause danger was neither near nor approaching.\r\n\r\nNearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter following\r\nhim prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a thick bush,\r\nand drew out a rag.\r\n\r\nIt was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett immediately\r\nbrought back to the corral. There it was examined by the colonists,\r\nwho found that it was a fragment of Ayrton’s waistcoat, a piece of that\r\nfelt, manufactured solely by the Granite House factory.\r\n\r\n“You see, Pencroft,” observed Harding, “there has been resistance on the\r\npart of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have dragged him away in\r\nspite of himself! Do you still doubt his honesty?”\r\n\r\n“No, captain,” answered the sailor, “and I repented of my suspicion a\r\nlong time ago! But it seems to me that something may be learned from the\r\nincident.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“It is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they dragged him\r\naway living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps, he is still\r\nliving!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, indeed,” replied the engineer, who remained thoughtful.\r\n\r\nThis was a hope, to which Ayrton’s companions could still hold. Indeed,\r\nthey had before believed that, surprised in the corral, Ayrton had\r\nfallen by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the convicts had not\r\nkilled him at first, if they had brought him living to another part of\r\nthe island, might it not be admitted that he was still their prisoner?\r\nPerhaps, even, one of them had found in Ayrton his old Australian\r\ncompanion Ben Joyce, the chief of the escaped convicts. And who knows\r\nbut that they had conceived the impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton\r\nto themselves? He would have been very useful to them, if they had been\r\nable to make him turn traitor!\r\n\r\nThis incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the corral, and\r\nit no longer appeared impossible that they should find Ayrton again.\r\nOn his side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would no doubt do all\r\nhe could to escape from the hands of the villains, and this would be a\r\npowerful aid to the settlers!\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” observed Gideon Spilett, “if happily Ayrton did manage to\r\nescape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he could not know\r\nof the attempted assassination of which Herbert has been a victim, and\r\nconsequently would never think of our being imprisoned in the corral.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!” cried Pencroft, “and\r\nthat we were there, too! For, although the rascals can do nothing to our\r\nhouse, they may plunder the plateau, our plantations, our poultry-yard!”\r\n\r\nPencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his crops.\r\nBut it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any to return\r\nto Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of the settlers\r\nwas needed there. And it was he who was keeping them at the corral!\r\nTherefore, one idea occupied his mind--to leave the corral, and when!\r\nHe believed he could bear removal to Granite House. He was sure his\r\nstrength would return more quickly in his room, with the air and sight\r\nof the sea!\r\n\r\nSeveral times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with\r\ngood reason, that Herbert’s wounds, half healed, might reopen on the\r\nway, did not give the order to start.\r\n\r\nHowever, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and his\r\ntwo friends to yield to the lad’s wish, and God alone knew that this\r\ndetermination might cause them grief and remorse.\r\n\r\nIt was the 29th of November, seven o’clock in the evening. The three\r\nsettlers were talking in Herbert’s room, when they heard Top utter quick\r\nbarks.\r\n\r\nHarding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the\r\nhouse. Top, at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking, but it\r\nwas with pleasure, not anger.\r\n\r\n“Some one is coming.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“It is not an enemy!”\r\n\r\n“Neb, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Or Ayrton?”\r\n\r\nThese words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two\r\ncompanions when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on the ground\r\ninside the corral.\r\n\r\nIt was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a most\r\ncordial reception.\r\n\r\n“Jup!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Neb has sent him to us,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Then,” replied the engineer, “he must have some note on him.”\r\n\r\nPencroft rushed up to the orang. Certainly if Neb had any important\r\nmatter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or\r\nmore rapid messenger, who could pass where neither the colonists could,\r\nnor even Top himself.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding was not mistaken. At Jup’s neck hung a small bag, and in\r\nthis bag was found a little note traced by Neb’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe despair of Harding and his companions may be imagined when they read\r\nthese words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“Friday, six o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n“Plateau invaded by convicts.\r\n\r\n                             “Neb.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThey gazed at each other without uttering a word, then they re-entered\r\nthe house. What were they to do? The convicts on Prospect Heights! that\r\nwas disaster, devastation, ruin.\r\n\r\nHerbert, on seeing the engineer, the reporter, and Pencroft re-enter,\r\nguessed that their situation was aggravated, and when he saw Jup, he no\r\nlonger doubted that some misfortune menaced Granite House.\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding,” said he, “I must go; I can bear the journey. I must\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett approached Herbert; then, having looked at him,--\r\n\r\n“Let us go, then!” said he.\r\n\r\nThe question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be carried on a\r\nlitter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the corral. The motion\r\nof the litter would have been more easy for the wounded lad, but it\r\nwould have necessitated two bearers, that is to say, there would have\r\nbeen two guns less for defense if an attack was made on the road. Would\r\nthey not, on the contrary, by employing the cart leave every arm free?\r\nWas it impossible to place the mattress on which Herbert was lying in\r\nit, and to advance with so much care that any jolt should be avoided? It\r\ncould be done.\r\n\r\nThe cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus Harding and\r\nthe reporter raised Herbert’s mattress and placed it on the bottom of\r\nthe cart. The weather was fine. The sun’s bright rays glanced through\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n“Are the guns ready?” asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nThey were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a double-barreled\r\ngun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had nothing to do but start.\r\n\r\n“Are you comfortable, Herbert?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Ah, captain,” replied the lad, “don’t be uneasy, I shall not die on the\r\nroad!”\r\n\r\nWhile speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had called up\r\nall his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had collected his\r\nfailing strength.\r\n\r\nThe engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated to\r\ngive the signal for departure; but that would have driven Herbert to\r\ndespair--killed him perhaps.\r\n\r\n“Forward!” said Harding.\r\n\r\nThe gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to be\r\nsilent, ran in advance. The cart came out, the gate was reclosed, and\r\nthe onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow pace.\r\n\r\nCertainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different road than\r\nthat which led straight from the corral to Granite House, but the cart\r\nwould have met with great difficulties in moving under the trees. It was\r\nnecessary, therefore, to follow this way, although it was well known to\r\nthe convicts.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the cart,\r\nready to answer to any attack. However, it was not probable that the\r\nconvicts would have yet left the plateau of Prospect Heights.\r\n\r\nNeb’s note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts\r\nhad shown themselves there. Now, this note was dated six o’clock in\r\nthe morning, and the active orang, accustomed to come frequently to the\r\ncorral, had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five\r\nmiles which separated it from Granite House. They would, therefore, be\r\nsafe at that time, and if there was any occasion for firing, it would\r\nprobably not be until they were in the neighborhood of Granite House.\r\nHowever, the colonists kept a strict watch. Top and Jup, the latter\r\narmed with his club, sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at\r\nthe sides of the road, signalized no danger.\r\n\r\nThe cart advanced slowly under Pencroft’s guidance. It had left the\r\ncorral at half-past seven. An hour after, four out of the five miles\r\nhad been cleared, without any incident having occurred. The road was\r\nas deserted as all that part of the Jacamar Wood which lay between the\r\nMercy and the lake. There was no occasion for any warning. The wood\r\nappeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThey approached the plateau. Another mile and they would see the bridge\r\nover Creek Glycerine. Cyrus Harding expected to find it in its place;\r\nsupposing that the convicts would have crossed it, and that, after\r\nhaving passed one of the streams which enclosed the plateau, they\r\nwould have taken the precaution to lower it again, so as to keep open a\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nAt length an opening in the trees allowed the sea-horizon to be seen.\r\nBut the cart continued its progress, for not one of its defenders\r\nthought of abandoning it.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse voice,--\r\n\r\n“Oh! the villains!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds, and the\r\nbuildings at the poultry-yard.\r\n\r\nA man was moving about in the midst of the smoke. It was Neb.\r\n\r\nHis companions uttered a shout. He heard, and ran to meet them.\r\n\r\nThe convicts had left the plateau nearly half-an-hour before, having\r\ndevastated it!\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Herbert?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett returned to the cart.\r\n\r\nHerbert had lost consciousness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nOf the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins\r\nwith which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer.\r\nHerbert’s critical state outweighed all other considerations. Would the\r\nremoval prove fatal to him by causing some internal injury? The reporter\r\ncould not affirm it, but he and his companions almost despaired of\r\nthe result. The cart was brought to the bend of the river. There some\r\nbranches, disposed as a liner, received the mattress on which lay the\r\nunconscious Herbert. Ten minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and\r\nPencroft were at the foot of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart\r\non to the plateau of Prospect Heights. The lift was put in motion, and\r\nHerbert was soon stretched on his bed in Granite House.\r\n\r\nWhat cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life! He smiled for\r\na moment on finding himself in his room, but could scarcely even murmur\r\na few words, so great was his weakness. Gideon Spilett examined his\r\nwounds. He feared to find them reopened, having been imperfectly healed.\r\nThere was nothing of the sort. From whence, then, came this prostration?\r\nwhy was Herbert so much worse? The lad then fell into a kind of feverish\r\nsleep, and the reporter and Pencroft remained near the bed. During this\r\ntime, Harding told Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb\r\nrecounted to his master the events of which the plateau had just been\r\nthe theater.\r\n\r\nIt was only during the preceding night that the convicts had appeared on\r\nthe edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek Glycerine. Neb, who\r\nwas watching near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of\r\nthe pirates, who was about to cross the stream; but in the darkness he\r\ncould not tell whether the man had been hit or not. At any rate, it was\r\nnot enough to frighten away the band, and Neb had only just time to get\r\nup to Granite House, where at least he was in safety.\r\n\r\nBut what was he to do there? How prevent the devastations with which the\r\nconvicts threatened the plateau? Had Neb any means by which to warn\r\nhis master? And, besides, in what situation were the inhabitants of the\r\ncorral themselves? Cyrus Harding and his companions had left on the 11th\r\nof November, and it was now the 29th. It was, therefore, nineteen days\r\nsince Neb had had other news than that brought by Top--disastrous news:\r\nAyrton disappeared, Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter,\r\nand sailor, as it were, imprisoned in the corral!\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do? asked poor Neb. Personally he had nothing to\r\nfear, for the convicts could not reach him in Granite House. But the\r\nbuildings, the plantations, all their arrangements at the mercy of the\r\npirates! Would it not be best to let Cyrus Harding judge of what he\r\nought to do, and to warn him, at least, of the danger which threatened\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nNeb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him. He knew\r\nthe orang’s great intelligence, which had been often put to the proof.\r\nJup understood the word corral, which had been frequently pronounced\r\nbefore him, and it may be remembered, too, that he had often driven\r\nthe cart thither in company with Pencroft. Day had not yet dawned. The\r\nactive orang would know how to pass unperceived through the woods, of\r\nwhich the convicts, besides, would think he was a native.\r\n\r\nNeb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup’s neck, he\r\nbrought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a\r\nlong cord to the ground; then, several times he repeated these words,--\r\n\r\n“Jup Jup! corral, corral!”\r\n\r\nThe creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down the beach,\r\nand disappeared in the darkness without the convicts’ attention having\r\nbeen in the least excited.\r\n\r\n“You did well, Neb,” said Harding, “but perhaps in not warning us you\r\nwould have done still better!”\r\n\r\nAnd, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose recovery\r\nthe removal had so seriously checked.\r\n\r\nNeb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on the\r\nbeach. Not knowing the number of the island’s inhabitants, they might\r\nsuppose that Granite House was defended by a large party. They must have\r\nremembered that during the attack by the brig numerous shot had been\r\nfired both from the lower and upper rocks, and no doubt they did not\r\nwish to expose themselves. But the plateau of Prospect Heights was\r\nopen to them, and not covered by the fire of Granite House. They gave\r\nthemselves up, therefore, to their instinct of destruction,--plundering,\r\nburning, devastating everything,--and only retiring half an hour before\r\nthe arrival of the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the\r\ncorral.\r\n\r\nOn their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the risk\r\nof being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire which was\r\nconsuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had struggled, though\r\nin vain, against it until the cart appeared at the edge of the wood.\r\n\r\nSuch had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts\r\nconstituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln\r\nIsland, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nSpilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft, while\r\nCyrus Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for himself of the\r\nextent of the disaster.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot of\r\nGranite House. The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case not\r\nhave escaped destruction. But after all, this evil would have been more\r\neasily reparable than the ruins accumulated on the plateau of Prospect\r\nHeights. Harding and Neb proceeded towards the Mercy, and ascended its\r\nleft bank without meeting with any trace of the convicts; nor on the\r\nother side of the river, in the depths of the wood, could they perceive\r\nany suspicious indications.\r\n\r\nBesides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the\r\nconvicts knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by having\r\nseen them pass on the road from the corral, or, after the devastation of\r\nthe plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood, following the course\r\nof the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their return.\r\n\r\nIn the former case, they must have returned towards the corral, now\r\nwithout defenders, and which contained valuable stores.\r\n\r\nIn the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and would wait\r\non opportunity to recommence the attack.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise to clear\r\nthe island was now rendered difficult by reason of Herbert’s condition.\r\nIndeed, their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with\r\nthe convicts, and just now no one could leave Granite House.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned\r\neverywhere. The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat, which\r\nwere nearly full-grown, lay on the ground. The other plantations had not\r\nsuffered less.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen-garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House possessed a\r\nstore of seed which would enable them to repair these misfortunes.\r\n\r\nAs to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable,\r\nthe fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures roamed over the\r\nplateau. The birds, which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters\r\nof the lake, had already returned to their accustomed spot, and were\r\ndabbling on the banks. Everything would have to be reconstructed.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding’s face, which was paler than usual, expressed an internal\r\nanger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not utter a word.\r\nOnce more he looked at his devastated fields, and at the smoke which\r\nstill rose from the ruins, then he returned to Granite House.\r\n\r\nThe following days were the saddest of any that the colonists had passed\r\non the island! Herbert’s weakness visibly increased. It appeared that\r\na more serious malady, the consequence of the profound physiological\r\ndisturbance he had gone through, threatened to declare itself, and\r\nGideon Spilett feared such an aggravation of his condition that he would\r\nbe powerless to fight against it!\r\n\r\nIn fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of drowsiness,\r\nand symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves. Refreshing drinks\r\nwere the only remedies at the colonists’ disposal. The fever was not\r\nas yet very high, but it soon appeared that it would probably recur at\r\nregular intervals. Gideon Spilett first recognized this on the 6th of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nThe poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely\r\npale, was at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations, and\r\ntremblings. His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his thirst\r\nintense. To this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became flushed; his\r\nskin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse perspiration broke out\r\nafter which the fever seemed to diminish. The attack had lasted nearly\r\nfive hours.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too certain, was\r\nnow seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever must be cured at any\r\ncost before it should assume a more serious aspect.\r\n\r\n“And in order to cure it,” said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, “we need a\r\nfebrifuge.”\r\n\r\n“A febrifuge--” answered the engineer. “We have neither Peruvian bark,\r\nnor sulphate of quinine.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Gideon Spilett, “but there are willows on the border of\r\nthe lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be a\r\nsubstitute for quinine.”\r\n\r\n“Let us try it without losing a moment,” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a\r\nsuccedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the horse-chestnut\r\ntree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc. It was evidently\r\nnecessary to make trial of this substance, although not so valuable as\r\nPeruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural state, since they had no\r\nmeans for extracting its essence.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black\r\nwillow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite House, and\r\nreduced them to a powder, which was administered that same evening to\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\nThe night passed without any important change. Herbert was somewhat\r\ndelirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not\r\nreturn either during the following day.\r\n\r\nPencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It might be\r\nthat the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it would return\r\nnext day. Therefore, he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety.\r\n\r\nIt might have been remarked besides that during this period Herbert\r\nremained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy. Another symptom\r\nalarmed the reporter to the highest degree. Herbert’s liver became\r\ncongested, and soon a more intense delirium showed that his brain was\r\nalso affected.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took the\r\nengineer aside.\r\n\r\n“It is a malignant fever,” said he.\r\n\r\n“A malignant fever!” cried Harding. “You are mistaken, Spilett. A\r\nmalignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ must\r\npreviously have existed.”\r\n\r\n“I am not mistaken,” replied the reporter. “Herbert no doubt contracted\r\nthe germ of this fever in the marshes of the island. He has already had\r\none attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent\r\na third, he is lost.”\r\n\r\n“But the willow bark?”\r\n\r\n“That is insufficient,” answered the reporter, “and the third attack of\r\na malignant fever, which is not arrested by means of quinine, is always\r\nfatal.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, Pencroft heard nothing of this conversation or he would\r\nhave gone mad.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined what anxiety the engineer and the reporter suffered\r\nduring the day of the 7th of December and the following night.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the day the second attack came on. The crisis was\r\nterrible. Herbert felt himself sinking. He stretched his arms towards\r\nCyrus Harding, towards Spilett, towards Pencroft. He was so young to\r\ndie! The scene was heart-rending. They were obliged to send Pencroft\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe fit lasted five hours. It was evident that Herbert could not survive\r\na third.\r\n\r\nThe night was frightful. In his delirium Herbert uttered words which\r\nwent to the hearts of his companions. He struggled with the convicts,\r\nhe called to Ayrton, he poured forth entreaties to that mysterious\r\nbeing,--that powerful unknown protector,--whose image was stamped upon\r\nhis mind; then he again fell into a deep exhaustion which completely\r\nprostrated him. Several times Gideon Spilett thought that the poor boy\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting\r\nfits. Herbert’s thin hands clutched the sheets. They had administered\r\nfurther doses of pounded bark, but the reporter expected no result from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“If before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic\r\nfebrifuge,” said the reporter, “Herbert will be dead.”\r\n\r\nNight arrived--the last night, it was too much to be feared, of the\r\ngood, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years, and who\r\nwas loved by all as their own child. The only remedy which existed\r\nagainst this terrible malignant fever, the only specific which could\r\novercome it, was not to be found in Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a more\r\nviolent delirium. His liver was fearfully congested, his brain affected,\r\nand already it was impossible for him to recognize any one.\r\n\r\nWould he live until the next day, until that third attack which\r\nmust infallibly carry him off? It was not probable. His strength was\r\nexhausted, and in the intervals of fever he lay as one dead.\r\n\r\nTowards three o’clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing cry.\r\nHe seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion. Neb, who was near him,\r\nterrified, ran into the next room where his companions were watching.\r\n\r\nTop, at that moment, barked in a strange manner.\r\n\r\nAll rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy, who was\r\nendeavoring to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett, taking his\r\narm, felt his pulse gradually quicken.\r\n\r\nIt was five in the morning. The rays of the rising sun began to shine in\r\nat the windows of Granite House. It promised to be a fine day, and this\r\nday was to be poor Herbert’s last!\r\n\r\nA ray glanced on the table placed near the bed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table.\r\n\r\nOn it lay a little oblong box, of which the cover bore these\r\nwords:--“SULPHATE OF QUININE.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly two\r\nhundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he carried to\r\nhis lips. The extreme bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt;\r\nit was certainly the precious extract of quinine, that pre-eminent\r\nantifebrile.\r\n\r\nThis powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How it came\r\nthere might be discussed later.\r\n\r\n“Some coffee!” said Spilett.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon Spilett\r\nthrew into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in\r\nmaking Herbert drink the mixture.\r\n\r\nThere was still time, for the third attack of the malignant fever had\r\nnot yet shown itself. How they longed to be able to add that it would\r\nnot return!\r\n\r\nBesides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived. The\r\nmysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical moment,\r\nwhen they had despaired of it.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours Herbert was much calmer. The colonists could now discuss\r\nthis incident. The intervention of the stranger was more evident than\r\never. But how had he been able to penetrate during the night into\r\nGranite House? It was inexplicable, and, in truth, the proceedings of\r\nthe genius of the island were not less mysterious than was that genius\r\nhimself. During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to\r\nHerbert every three hours.\r\n\r\nThe next day some improvement in Herbert’s condition was apparent.\r\nCertainly, he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers being subject\r\nto frequent and dangerous relapses, but the most assiduous care was\r\nbestowed on him. And besides, the specific was at hand; nor, doubtless,\r\nwas he who had brought it far distant! And the hearts of all were\r\nanimated by returning hope.\r\n\r\nThis hope was not disappointed. Ten days after, on the 20th of December,\r\nHerbert’s convalescence commenced.\r\n\r\nHe was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him, but no\r\naccess of fever supervened. And then, the poor boy submitted with such\r\ndocility to all the prescriptions ordered him! He longed so to get well!\r\n\r\nPencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of an abyss.\r\nFits of joy approaching delirium seized him. When the time for the third\r\nattack had passed by, he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace.\r\nSince then, he always called him Dr. Spilett.\r\n\r\nThe real doctor, however, remained undiscovered.\r\n\r\n“We will find him!” repeated the sailor.\r\n\r\nCertainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too\r\nenergetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft!\r\n\r\nThe month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during which\r\nthe colonists of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely tried.\r\nThey commenced the year 1868 with magnificent weather, great heat, and\r\na tropical temperature, delightfully cooled by the sea-breeze. Herbert’s\r\nrecovery progressed, and from his bed, placed near one of the windows of\r\nGranite House, he could inhale the fresh air, charged with ozone, which\r\ncould not fail to restore his health. His appetite returned, and what\r\nnumberless delicate, savory little dishes Neb prepared for him!\r\n\r\n“It is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity\r\nof Granite House. There was no news of Ayrton, and though the engineer\r\nand Herbert still had some hopes of finding him again, their companions\r\ndid not doubt but that the unfortunate man had perished. However, this\r\nuncertainty could not last, and when once the lad should have recovered,\r\nthe expedition, the result of which must be so important, would be\r\nundertaken. But they would have to wait a month, perhaps, for all\r\nthe strength of the colony must be put into requisition to obtain\r\nsatisfaction from the convicts.\r\n\r\nHowever, Herbert’s convalescence progressed rapidly. The congestion of\r\nthe liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be considered completely\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of January, important work was done on the plateau\r\nof Prospect Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as much as was\r\npossible from the devastated crops, either of corn or vegetables. The\r\ngrain and the plants were gathered, so as to provide a new harvest for\r\nthe approaching half-season. With regard to rebuilding the poultry-yard,\r\nwall, or stables, Cyrus Harding preferred to wait. While he and his\r\ncompanions were in pursuit of the convicts, the latter might very\r\nprobably pay another visit to the plateau, and it would be useless to\r\ngive them an opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction. When\r\nthe island should be cleared of these miscreants, they would set about\r\nrebuilding. The young convalescent began to get up in the second week of\r\nJanuary, at first for one hour a day, then two, then three. His strength\r\nvisibly returned, so vigorous was his constitution. He was now eighteen\r\nyears of age. He was tall, and promised to become a man of noble and\r\ncommanding presence. From this time his recovery, while still requiring\r\ncare,--and Dr. Spilett was very strict,--made rapid progress. Towards\r\nthe end of the month, Herbert was already walking about on Prospect\r\nHeights, and the beach.\r\n\r\nHe derived, from several sea-baths, which he took in company with\r\nPencroft and Neb, the greatest possible benefit. Cyrus Harding thought\r\nhe might now settle the day for their departure, for which the 15th of\r\nFebruary was fixed. The nights, very clear at this time of year, would\r\nbe favorable to the researches they intended to make all over the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe necessary preparations for this exploration were now commenced, and\r\nwere important, for the colonists had sworn not to return to Granite\r\nHouse until their twofold object had been achieved; on the one hand, to\r\nexterminate the convicts, and rescue Ayrton, if he was still living; on\r\nthe other, to discover who it was that presided so effectually over the\r\nfortunes of the colony.\r\n\r\nOf Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern coast\r\nfrom Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn Marsh, the\r\nneighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the road to the corral\r\nand the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and lastly, the\r\nspurs of Mount Franklin, among which the corral had been established.\r\n\r\nThey had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore\r\nof Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy\r\nborder of the west coast, and the interminable downs, ending at the open\r\nmouth of Shark Gulf. But they had in no way surveyed the woods which\r\ncovered the Serpentine Peninsula, all to the right of the Mercy, the\r\nleft bank of Falls River, and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which\r\nsupported three quarters of the base of Mount Franklin, to the east, the\r\nnorth, and the west, and where doubtless many secret retreats existed.\r\nConsequently, many millions of acres of the island had still escaped\r\ntheir investigations.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried through\r\nthe Far West, so as to include all that region situated on the right of\r\nthe Mercy.\r\n\r\nIt might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the corral,\r\nwhere it might be supposed that the convicts had again taken refuge,\r\neither to pillage or to establish themselves there. But either the\r\ndevastation of the corral would have been an accomplished fact by\r\nthis time, and it would be too late to prevent it, or it had been the\r\nconvicts’ interest to entrench themselves there, and there would be\r\nstill time to go and turn them out on their return.\r\n\r\nTherefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to, and the\r\nsettlers resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile End. They would\r\nmake their way with their hatchets, and thus lay the first draft of a\r\nroad which would place Granite House in communication with the end of\r\nthe peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles.\r\n\r\nThe cart was in good condition. The onagers, well rested, could go a\r\nlong journey. Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various\r\nutensils were packed in the cart, as also weapons and ammunition,\r\ncarefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of Granite House. But it\r\nwas necessary to remember that the convicts were, perhaps, roaming about\r\nthe woods, and that in the midst of these thick forests a shot might\r\nquickly be fired and received. It was therefore resolved that the little\r\nband of settlers should remain together and not separate under any\r\npretext whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House. Top\r\nand Jup themselves were to accompany the expedition; the inaccessible\r\ndwelling needed no guard. The 14th of February, eve of the departure,\r\nwas consecrated entirely to repose, and--thanksgiving addressed by the\r\ncolonists to the Creator. A place in the cart was reserved for Herbert,\r\nwho, though thoroughly convalescent, was still a little weak. The next\r\nmorning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to\r\nprotect Granite House from any invasion. The ladders, which were\r\nformerly used for the ascent, were brought to the Chimneys and buried\r\ndeep in the sand, so that they might be available on the return of the\r\ncolonists, for the machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces, and\r\nnothing of the apparatus remained. Pencroft stayed the last in Granite\r\nHouse in order to finish this work, and he then lowered himself down\r\nby means of a double rope held below, and which, when once hauled down,\r\nleft no communication between the upper landing and the beach.\r\n\r\nThe weather was magnificent.\r\n\r\n“We shall have a warm day of it,” said the reporter, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Pooh! Dr. Spilett,” answered Pencroft, “we shall walk under the shade\r\nof the trees and shan’t even see the sun!”\r\n\r\n“Forward!” said the engineer.\r\n\r\nThe cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys. The reporter\r\nmade Herbert take his place in it during the first hours at least of the\r\njourney, and the lad was obliged to submit to his doctor’s orders.\r\n\r\nNeb placed himself at the onagers’ heads. Cyrus Harding, the reporter,\r\nand the sailor, walked in front. Top bounded joyfully along. Herbert\r\noffered a seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted it without ceremony.\r\nThe moment for departure had arrived, and the little band set out.\r\n\r\nThe cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then, having\r\nascended the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at the other side\r\nof which commenced the road to Port Balloon, and there the explorers,\r\nleaving this road on their left, entered the cover of the immense woods\r\nwhich formed the region of the Far West.\r\n\r\nFor the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the cart to\r\npass with ease; from time to time it became necessary to cut away a few\r\ncreepers and bushes, but no serious obstacle impeded the progress of the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nThe thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the ground.\r\nDeodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum-trees, dragon-trees,\r\nand other well-known species, succeeded each other far as the eye could\r\nreach. The feathered tribes of the island were all represented--grouse,\r\njacamars, pheasants, lories, as well as the chattering cockatoos,\r\nparrots, and paroquets. Agouties, kangaroos, and capybaras fled swiftly\r\nat their approach; and all this reminded the settlers of the first\r\nexcursions they had made on their arrival at the island.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” observed Cyrus Harding, “I notice that these creatures,\r\nboth birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly. These woods\r\nhave, therefore, been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall\r\ncertainly find some traces of them.”\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces, more or\r\nless recent, of the passage of a band of men--here branches broken off\r\nthe trees, perhaps to mark out the way; there the ashes of a fire, and\r\nfootprints in clayey spots; but nothing which appeared to belong to a\r\nsettled encampment.\r\n\r\nThe engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from hunting. The\r\nreports of the firearms might give the alarm to the convicts, who\r\nwere, perhaps, roaming through the forest. Moreover, the hunters would\r\nnecessarily ramble some distance from the cart, which it was dangerous\r\nto leave unguarded.\r\n\r\nIn the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite House,\r\ntheir progress became much more difficult. In order to make their way\r\nthrough some thickets, they were obliged to cut down trees. Before\r\nentering such places Harding was careful to send in Top and Jup, who\r\nfaithfully accomplished their commission, and when the dog and orang\r\nreturned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to\r\nfear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal\r\nkingdom, whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level. On the\r\nevening of the first day the colonists encamped about nine miles from\r\nGranite House, on the border of a little stream falling into the Mercy,\r\nand of the existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it\r\nevidently, however, belonged to the hydiographical system to which the\r\nsoil owed its astonishing fertility. The settlers made a hearty meal,\r\nfor their appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken that\r\nthe night might be passed in safety. If the engineer had had only to\r\ndeal with wild beasts, jaguars or others, he would have simply lighted\r\nfires all around his camp, which would have sufficed for its defense;\r\nbut the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames,\r\nand it was, therefore, better to be surrounded by the profound darkness\r\nof night.\r\n\r\nThe watch was, however, carefully organized. Two of the settlers were\r\nto watch together, and every two hours it was agreed that they should\r\nbe relieved by their comrades. And so, notwithstanding his wish to the\r\ncontrary, Herbert was exempted from guard. Pencroft and Gideon Spilett\r\nin one party, the engineer and Neb in another, mounted guard in turns\r\nover the camp.\r\n\r\nThe night, however, was but of few hours. The darkness was due rather to\r\nthe thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun.\r\nThe silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the\r\nchattering of the monkeys, the latter appearing to particularly irritate\r\nMaster Jup. The night passed without incident, and on the next day, the\r\n15th of February, the journey through the forest, tedious rather than\r\ndifficult, was continued. This day they could not accomplish more than\r\nsix miles, for every moment they were obliged to cut a road with their\r\nhatchets.\r\n\r\nLike true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful\r\ntrees, which would besides have cost immense labor to fell, and the\r\nsmall ones only were sacrificed, but the result was that the road took a\r\nvery winding direction, and lengthened itself by numerous detours.\r\n\r\nDuring the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not before met\r\nwith in the island, such as the tree-fern, with its leaves spread out\r\nlike the waters of a fountain, locust-trees, on the long pods of\r\nwhich the onagers browsed greedily, and which supplied a sweet pulp\r\nof excellent flavor. There, too, the colonists again found groups of\r\nmagnificent kauries, their cylindrical trunks, crowded with a cone\r\nof verdure, rising to a height of two hundred feet. These were the\r\ntree-kings of New Zealand, as celebrated as the cedars of Lebanon.\r\n\r\nAs to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already known to\r\nthe hunters. Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get near them, a\r\ncouple of those large birds peculiar to Australia, a sort of cassowary,\r\ncalled emu, five feet in height, and with brown plumage, which belong\r\nto the tribe of waders. Top darted after them as fast as his four legs\r\ncould carry him, but the emus distanced him with ease, so prodigious was\r\ntheir speed.\r\n\r\nAs to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were discovered. Some\r\nfootprints found near an apparently recently extinguished fire were\r\nattentively examined by the settlers. By measuring them one after the\r\nother, according to their length and breadth, the marks of five men’s\r\nfeet were easily distinguished. The five convicts had evidently\r\ncamped on this spot; but,--and this was the object of so minute an\r\nexamination,--a sixth footprint could not be discovered, which in that\r\ncase would have been that of Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton was not with them!” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Pencroft, “and if he was not with them, it was because\r\nthe wretches had already murdered him! but then these rascals have not a\r\nden to which they may be tracked like tigers!”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the reporter, “it is more probable that they wander at\r\nrandom, and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they\r\nwill be masters of the island!”\r\n\r\n“The masters of the island!” exclaimed the sailor; “the masters of the\r\nisland!...” he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his throat was\r\nseized in an iron grasp. Then in a calmer tone, “Do you know, Captain\r\nHarding,” said he, “what the ball is which I have rammed into my gun?”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft!”\r\n\r\n“It is the ball that went through Herbert’s chest, and I promise you it\r\nwon’t miss its mark!”\r\n\r\nBut this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life, and from\r\nthe examination of the footprints left in the ground, they must, alas!\r\nconclude that all hopes of ever seeing him again must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThat evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House, and Cyrus\r\nHarding calculated that they could not be more than five miles from\r\nReptile Point.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached, and\r\nthe whole length of the forest had been traversed; but there was nothing\r\nto indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge, nor\r\nthat, no less secret, which sheltered the mysterious unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the exploration\r\nof all that wooded region forming the shore from Reptile End to Falls\r\nRiver. The colonists were able to search this forest thoroughly, for, as\r\nit was comprised between the two shores of the Serpentine Peninsula, it\r\nwas only from three to four miles in breadth. The trees, both by their\r\nheight and their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of\r\nthe soil, more astonishing here than in any other part of the island.\r\nOne might have said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or\r\nAfrica had been transported into this temperate zone. This led them to\r\nconclude that the superb vegetation found a heat in this soil, damp in\r\nits upper layer, but warmed in the interior by volcanic fires, which\r\ncould not belong to a temperate climate. The most frequently occurring\r\ntrees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic dimensions.\r\n\r\nBut the colonists’ object was not simply to admire the magnificent\r\nvegetation. They knew already that in this respect Lincoln Island would\r\nhave been worthy to take the first rank in the Canary group, to which\r\nthe first name given was that of the Happy Isles. Now, alas! their\r\nisland no longer belonged to them entirely; others had taken possession\r\nof it, miscreants polluted its shores, and they must be destroyed to the\r\nlast man.\r\n\r\nNo traces were found on the western coast, although they were carefully\r\nsought for. No more footprints, no more broken branches, no more\r\ndeserted camps.\r\n\r\n“This does not surprise me,” said Cyrus Harding to his companions.\r\n“The convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of Flotsam\r\nPoint, and they immediately plunged into the Far West forests, after\r\ncrossing Tadorn Marsh. They then followed almost the same route that we\r\ntook on leaving Granite House. This explains the traces we found in the\r\nwood. But, arriving on the shore, the convicts saw at once that they\r\nwould discover no suitable retreat there, and it was then that, going\r\nnorthwards again, they came upon the corral.”\r\n\r\n“Where they have perhaps returned,” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” answered the engineer, “for they would naturally\r\nsuppose that our researches would be in that direction. The corral is\r\nonly a storehouse to them, and not a definitive encampment.”\r\n\r\n“I am of Cyrus’ opinion,” said the reporter, “and I think that it is\r\namong the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made their\r\nlair.”\r\n\r\n“Then, captain, straight to the corral!” cried Pencroft. “We must finish\r\nthem off, and till now we have only lost time!”\r\n\r\n“No, my friend,” replied the engineer; “you forget that we have a reason\r\nfor wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not contain some\r\nhabitation. Our exploration has a double object, Pencroft. If, on the\r\none hand, we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of\r\ngratitude to perform.”\r\n\r\n“That was well said, captain,” replied the sailor, “but, all the same,\r\nit is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until he pleases.”\r\n\r\nAnd truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was probable\r\nthat the stranger’s retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself.\r\n\r\nThat evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The camp was\r\norganized as usual, and the customary precautions were taken for the\r\nnight. Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before\r\nhis illness, derived great benefit from this life in the open air,\r\nbetween the sea breezes and the vivifying air from the forests. His\r\nplace was no longer in the cart, but at the head of the troop.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the shore,\r\nwhere, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so picturesquely\r\npiled up, ascended the river by its left bank. The road had been already\r\npartly cleared in their former excursions made from the corral to the\r\nwest coast. The settlers were now about six miles from Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s plan was this:--To minutely survey the valley forming\r\nthe bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the neighborhood of the\r\ncorral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it by force; if it was not,\r\nto entrench themselves there and make it the center of the operations\r\nwhich had for their object the exploration of Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\nThis plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they were\r\nimpatient to regain entire possession of their island.\r\n\r\nThey made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the\r\nlargest spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the river’s bank,\r\nbecame rare on the upper slopes of the mountain. The ground was hilly\r\nand rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over which they did not\r\nventure without extreme precaution. Top and Jup skirmished on the\r\nflanks, springing right and left through the thick brushwood, and\r\nemulating each other in intelligence and activity. But nothing showed\r\nthat the banks of the stream had been recently frequented--nothing\r\nannounced either the presence or the proximity of the convicts. Towards\r\nfive in the evening the cart stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade.\r\nA semicircular screen of trees still hid it.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to ascertain if it\r\nwas occupied. To go there openly, in broad daylight, when the convicts\r\nwere probably in ambush, would be to expose themselves, as poor Herbert\r\nhad done, to the firearms of the ruffians. It was better, then, to wait\r\nuntil night came on.\r\n\r\nHowever, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the\r\napproaches to the corral, and Pencroft, who was quite out of patience,\r\nvolunteered to accompany him.\r\n\r\n“No, my friends,” said the engineer, “wait till night. I will not allow\r\none of you to expose himself in open day.”\r\n\r\n“But, captain--” answered the sailor, little disposed to obey.\r\n\r\n“I beg of you, Pencroft,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Very well!” replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another way, by\r\nbestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThe colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully watched\r\nthe neighboring parts of the forest.\r\n\r\nThree hours passed thus. The wind had fallen, and absolute silence\r\nreigned under the great trees. The snapping of the smallest twig, a\r\nfootstep on the dry leaves, the gliding of a body among the grass, would\r\nhave been heard without difficulty. All was quiet. Besides, Top, lying\r\non the grass, his head stretched out on his paws, gave no sign of\r\nuneasiness. At eight o’clock the day appeared far enough advanced for\r\nthe reconnaissance to be made under favorable conditions. Gideon Spilett\r\ndeclared himself ready to set out accompanied by Pencroft. Cyrus Harding\r\nconsented. Top and Jup were to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and\r\nNeb, for a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm.\r\n\r\n“Do not be imprudent,” said Harding to the reporter and Pencroft, “you\r\nhave not to gain possession of the corral, but only to find out whether\r\nit is occupied or not.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” answered Pencroft.\r\n\r\nAnd the two departed.\r\n\r\nUnder the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the obscurity\r\nrendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty\r\nfeet. The reporter and Pencroft, halting at any suspicious sound,\r\nadvanced with great caution.\r\n\r\nThey walked a little distance apart from each other so as to offer a\r\nless mark for a shot. And, to tell the truth, they expected every moment\r\nto hear a report. Five minutes after leaving the cart, Gideon Spilett\r\nand Pencroft arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond\r\nwhich rose the palisade.\r\n\r\nThey stopped. A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of\r\ntrees. Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral, which appeared\r\nto be closed. This thirty feet, which it was necessary to cross from\r\nthe wood to the palisade, constituted the dangerous zone, to borrow\r\na ballistic term: in fact, one or more bullets fired from behind the\r\npalisade might knock over any one who ventured on to this zone. Gideon\r\nSpilett and the sailor were not men to draw back, but they knew that\r\nany imprudence on their part, of which they would be the first victims,\r\nwould fall afterwards on their companions. If they themselves were\r\nkilled, what would become of Harding, Neb, and Herbert?\r\n\r\nBut Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral where he\r\nsupposed the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press forward, when\r\nthe reporter held him back with a grasp of iron.\r\n\r\n“In a few minutes it will be quite dark,” whispered Spilett in the\r\nsailor’s ear, “then will be the time to act.”\r\n\r\nPencroft, convulsively clasping the butt-end of his gun, restrained his\r\nenergies, and waited, swearing to himself.\r\n\r\nSoon the last of the twilight faded away. Darkness, which seemed as if\r\nit issued from the dense forest, covered the clearing. Mount Franklin\r\nrose like an enormous screen before the western horizon, and night\r\nspread rapidly over all, as it does in regions of low latitudes. Now was\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nThe reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge of the\r\nwood, had not once lost sight of the palisade. The corral appeared to\r\nbe absolutely deserted. The top of the palisade formed a line, a\r\nlittle darker than the surrounding shadow, and nothing disturbed its\r\ndistinctness. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have\r\nposted one of their number to guard against any surprise.\r\n\r\nSpilett grasped his companion’s hand, and both crept towards the corral,\r\ntheir guns ready to fire.\r\n\r\nThey reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by a single\r\nray of light.\r\n\r\nPencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and he had\r\nsupposed, was closed. However, the sailor was able to ascertain that the\r\nouter bars had not been put up. It might, then, be concluded that the\r\nconvicts were there in the corral, and that very probably they had\r\nfastened the gate in such a way that it could not be forced open.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett and Pencroft listened.\r\n\r\nNot a sound could be heard inside the palisade. The musmons and the\r\ngoats, sleeping no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the calm of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves whether\r\nthey had not better scale the palisades and penetrate into the corral.\r\nThis would have been contrary to Cyrus Harding’s instructions.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also fail.\r\nNow, if the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew nothing of\r\nthe expedition against them, if, lastly, there now existed a chance\r\nof surprising them, ought this chance to be lost by inconsiderately\r\nattempting to cross the palisades?\r\n\r\nThis was not the reporter’s opinion. He thought it better to wait until\r\nall the settlers were collected together before attempting to penetrate\r\ninto the corral. One thing was certain, that it was possible to reach\r\nthe palisade without being seen, and also that it did not appear to be\r\nguarded. This point settled, there was nothing to be done but to return\r\nto the cart, where they would consult.\r\n\r\nPencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the\r\nreporter without making any objection when the latter turned back to the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, after a little thought, “I now have reason to believe\r\nthat the convicts are not in the corral.”\r\n\r\n“We shall soon know,” said Pencroft, “when we have scaled the palisade.”\r\n\r\n“To the corral, my friends!” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Shall we leave the cart in the wood?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the engineer, “it is our wagon of ammunition and\r\nprovisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an entrenchment.”\r\n\r\n“Forward, then!” said Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\nThe cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly towards the\r\npalisade. The darkness was now profound, the silence as complete as\r\nwhen Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground. The thick grass\r\ncompletely muffled their footsteps. The colonists held themselves ready\r\nto fire. Jup, at Pencroft’s orders, kept behind. Neb led Top in a leash,\r\nto prevent him from bounding forward.\r\n\r\nThe clearing soon came in sight. It was deserted. Without hesitating,\r\nthe little band moved towards the palisade. In a short space of time the\r\ndangerous zone was passed. Neb remained at the onagers’ heads to hold\r\nthem. The engineer, the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to\r\nthe door, in order to ascertain if it was barricaded inside. It was\r\nopen!\r\n\r\n“What do you say now?” asked the engineer, turning to the sailor and\r\nSpilett.\r\n\r\nBoth were stupefied.\r\n\r\n“I can swear,” said Pencroft, “that this gate was shut just now!”\r\n\r\nThe colonists now hesitated. Were the convicts in the corral when\r\nPencroft and the reporter made their reconnaissance? It could not be\r\ndoubted, as the gate then closed could only have been opened by them.\r\nWere they still there, or had one of their number just gone out?\r\n\r\nAll these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of\r\nthe colonists, but how could they be answered?\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the\r\nenclosure, drew back hurriedly, and seized Harding’s hand.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“A light!”\r\n\r\n“In the house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\nAll five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them, they saw\r\nglimmering a feeble light. Cyrus Harding made up his mind rapidly. “It\r\nis our only chance,” said he to his companions, “of finding the convicts\r\ncollected in this house, suspecting nothing! They are in our power!\r\nForward!” The colonists crossed through the enclosure, holding their\r\nguns ready in their hands. The cart had been left outside under the\r\ncharge of Jup and Top, who had been prudently tied to it.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert and Neb\r\non the other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the absolutely dark\r\nand deserted corral.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they were near the closed door of the house.\r\n\r\nHarding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the window,\r\nthen feebly lighted by the inner light.\r\n\r\nHe gazed into the apartment.\r\n\r\nOn the table burned a lantern. Near the table was the bed formerly used\r\nby Ayrton.\r\n\r\nOn the bed lay the body of a man.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,--“Ayrton!” he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nImmediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists\r\nrushed into the room.\r\n\r\nAyrton appeared to be asleep. His countenance showed that he had long\r\nand cruelly suffered. On his wrists and ankles could be seen great\r\nbruises.\r\n\r\nHarding bent over him.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton!” cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he had\r\njust found again under such unexpected circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at Harding, then\r\nat the others,--\r\n\r\n“You!” he cried, “you?”\r\n\r\n“Ayrton! Ayrton!” repeated Harding.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?”\r\n\r\n“In the house in the corral!”\r\n\r\n“Alone?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“But they will come back!” cried Ayrton. “Defend yourselves! defend\r\nyourselves!”\r\n\r\nAnd he fell back exhausted.\r\n\r\n“Spilett,” exclaimed the engineer, “we may be attacked at any moment.\r\nBring the cart into the corral. Then, barricade the door, and all come\r\nback here.”\r\n\r\nPencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the engineer’s\r\norders. There was not a moment to be lost. Perhaps even now the cart was\r\nin the hands of the convicts!\r\n\r\nIn a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral\r\nand reached the gate of the palisade behind which Top was heard growling\r\nsullenly.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to fire.\r\nHerbert was at his side. Both surveyed the crest of the spur overlooking\r\nthe corral. If the convicts were lying in ambush there, they might knock\r\nthe settlers over one after the other.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of\r\nthe forest, and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the\r\nenclosure. The corral, with its clumps of trees, the little stream which\r\nwatered it, its wide carpet of grass, was suddenly illuminated. From\r\nthe side of the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade stood\r\nout white in the moonlight. On the opposite side towards the door, the\r\nenclosure remained dark. A black mass soon appeared. This was the cart\r\nentering the circle of light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise\r\nmade by the door, as his companions shut it and fastened the interior\r\nbars.\r\n\r\nBut, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark furiously and\r\nrush to the back of the corral, to the right of the house.\r\n\r\n“Be ready to fire, my friends!” cried Harding.\r\n\r\nThe colonists raised their pieces and waited the moment to fire.\r\n\r\nTop still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered shrill\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nThe colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the little\r\nstream, shaded by large trees. And there, in the bright moonlight, what\r\ndid they see? Five corpses, stretched on the bank!\r\n\r\nThey were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had landed\r\non Lincoln Island!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\nHow had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton? No, for\r\na moment before he was dreading their return.\r\n\r\nBut Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer\r\npossible to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had again\r\nbecome unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the bed.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the\r\ninfluence of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving\r\nAyrton’s house, or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the\r\nconvicts. It was very probable that Ayrton would not be able to throw\r\nany light on the circumstances under which the bodies had been found,\r\nsince he himself was not aware that he was in the corral. But at any\r\nrate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken\r\nplace before this terrible execution. The next day Ayrton awoke from his\r\ntorpor, and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt,\r\non seeing him again, almost safe and sound, after a hundred and four\r\ndays separation.\r\n\r\nAyrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at least, as\r\nmuch as he knew.\r\n\r\nThe day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last November,\r\nat nightfall, he was surprised by the convicts, who had scaled the\r\npalisade. They bound and gagged him; then he was led to a dark cavern,\r\nat the foot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had taken refuge.\r\n\r\nHis death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts were\r\nabout to kill him, when one of them recognized him and called him by\r\nthe name which he bore in Australia. The wretches had no scruples as to\r\nmurdering Ayrton! They spared Ben Joyce!\r\n\r\nBut from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of his\r\nformer accomplices. They wished him to join them again, and relied upon\r\nhis aid to enable them to gain possession of Granite House, to penetrate\r\ninto that hitherto inaccessible dwelling, and to become masters of the\r\nisland, after murdering the colonists!\r\n\r\nAyrton remained firm. The once convict, now repentant and pardoned,\r\nwould rather die than betray his companions. Ayrton--bound, gagged, and\r\nclosely watched--lived in this cave for four months.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after\r\ntheir arrival in the island, and since then they had subsisted on\r\nAyrton’s stores, but did not live at the corral.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the\r\ncolonists’ arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned, boasting\r\nof having killed one of the inhabitants of the island; but he returned\r\nalone. His companion, as is known, fell by Cyrus Harding’s dagger.\r\n\r\nAyrton’s anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the news of\r\nHerbert’s death. The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed,\r\nat the mercy of the convicts. After this event, and during all the\r\ntime that the colonists, detained by Herbert’s illness, remained in the\r\ncorral, the pirates did not leave their cavern, and even after they had\r\npillaged the plateau of Prospect Heights, they did not think it prudent\r\nto abandon it.\r\n\r\nThe ill-treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled. His hands and\r\nfeet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound him day and\r\nnight. Every moment he expected to be put to death, nor did it appear\r\npossible that he could escape.\r\n\r\nMatters remained thus until the third week of February. The convicts,\r\nstill watching for a favorable opportunity, rarely quitted their\r\nretreat, and only made a few hunting excursions, either to the interior\r\nof the island, or the south coast.\r\n\r\nAyrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all hope\r\nof ever seeing them again. At last, the unfortunate man, weakened\r\nby ill-treatment, fell into a prostration so profound that sight and\r\nhearing failed him. From that moment, that is to say, since the last two\r\ndays, he could give no information whatever of what had occurred.\r\n\r\n“But, Captain Harding,” he added, “since I was imprisoned in that\r\ncavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?”\r\n\r\n“How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the\r\nenclosure?” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding his\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nHis companions supported him. He wished to get up, and with their\r\nassistance he did so. They then proceeded together towards the little\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nIt was now broad daylight.\r\n\r\nThere, on the bank, in the position in which they had been stricken\r\nby death in its most instantaneous form, lay the corpses of the five\r\nconvicts!\r\n\r\nAyrton was astounded. Harding and his companions looked at him without\r\nuttering a word. On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroft examined\r\nthe bodies, already stiffened by the cold.\r\n\r\nThey bore no apparent trace of any wound.\r\n\r\nOnly, after carefully examining them, Pencroft found on the forehead of\r\none, on the chest of another, on the back of this one, on the shoulder\r\nof that, a little red spot, a sort of scarcely visible bruise, the cause\r\nof which it was impossible to conjecture.\r\n\r\n“It is there that they have been struck!” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“But with what weapon?” cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n“A weapon, lightning-like in its effects, and of which we have not the\r\nsecret!”\r\n\r\n“And who has struck the blow?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“The avenging power of the island,” replied Harding, “he who brought you\r\nhere, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested itself, who does\r\nfor us all that which we cannot do for ourselves, and who, his will\r\naccomplished, conceals himself from us.”\r\n\r\n“Let us make search for him, then!” exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we will search for him,” answered Harding, “but we shall not\r\ndiscover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until he pleases\r\nto call us to him!”\r\n\r\nThis invisible protection, which rendered their own action unavailing,\r\nboth irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative inferiority which\r\nit proved was of a nature to wound a haughty spirit. A generosity\r\nevinced in such a manner as to elude all tokens of gratitude, implied a\r\nsort of disdain for those on whom the obligation was conferred, which in\r\nCyrus Harding’s eyes marred, in some degree, the worth of the benefit.\r\n\r\n“Let us search,” he resumed, “and God grant that we may some day be\r\npermitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to deal\r\nwith ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay him, by\r\nrendering him in our turn, although at the price of our lives, some\r\nsignal service!”\r\n\r\nFrom this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island were\r\nsolely occupied with the intended search. Everything incited them to\r\ndiscover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would only be the\r\nname of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in some degree\r\nsuperhuman power.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their\r\ninfluence soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy. Neb\r\nand Pencroft carried the corpses of the convicts into the forest, some\r\ndistance from the corral, and buried them deep in the ground.\r\n\r\nAyrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during\r\nhis seclusion. He learned Herbert’s adventures, and through what various\r\ntrials the colonists had passed. As to the settlers, they had despaired\r\nof ever seeing Ayrton again, and had been convinced that the convicts\r\nhad ruthlessly murdered him.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, “a duty remains\r\nfor us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but although the\r\nconvicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing to ourselves that\r\nwe are once more masters of the island.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” answered Gideon Spilett, “let us search all this labyrinth of\r\nthe spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a hollow, not a hole\r\nunexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a\r\nmystery, it is I who now speak to you, my friends!”\r\n\r\n“And we will not return to Granite House until we have found our\r\nbenefactor,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the engineer, “we will do all that it is humanly possible to\r\ndo, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself permits us.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we stay at the corral?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“We shall stay here,” answered Harding. “Provisions are abundant, and we\r\nare here in the very center of the circle we have to explore. Besides,\r\nif necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” answered the sailor. “Only I have a remark to make.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Here is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that we have\r\na voyage to make.”\r\n\r\n“A voyage?” said Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Yes, to Tabor Island,” answered Pencroft. “It is necessary to carry a\r\nnotice there to point out the position of our island and say that Ayrton\r\nis here in case the Scotch yacht should come to take him off. Who knows\r\nif it is not already too late?”\r\n\r\n“But, Pencroft,” asked Ayrton, “how do you intend to make this voyage?”\r\n\r\n“In the ‘Bonadventure.’”\r\n\r\n“The ‘Bonadventure!’” exclaimed Ayrton. “She no longer exists.”\r\n\r\n“My ‘Bonadventure’ exists no longer!” shouted Pencroft, bounding from\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Ayrton. “The convicts discovered her in her little harbor\r\nonly eight days ago, they put to sea in her--”\r\n\r\n“And?” said Pencroft, his heart beating.\r\n\r\n“And not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks, and the\r\nvessel went to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!” exclaimed\r\nPencroft.\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” said Herbert, taking the sailor’s hand, “we will build\r\nanother ‘Bonadventure’--a larger one. We have all the ironwork--all the\r\nrigging of the brig at our disposal.”\r\n\r\n“But do you know,” returned Pencroft, “that it will take at least five\r\nor six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty tons?”\r\n\r\n“We can take our time,” said the reporter, “and we must give up the\r\nvoyage to Tabor Island for this year.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my ‘Bonadventure!’ my poor ‘Bonadventure!’” cried Pencroft, almost\r\nbroken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so\r\nproud.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the “Bonadventure” was certainly a thing to be lamented by\r\nthe colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should be repaired\r\nas soon as possible. This settled, they now occupied themselves with\r\nbringing their researches to bear on the most secret parts of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of February, and\r\nlasted an entire week. The base of the mountain, with its spurs and\r\ntheir numberless ramifications, formed a labyrinth of valleys and\r\nelevations. It was evident that there, in the depths of these narrow\r\ngorges, perhaps even in the interior of Mount Franklin itself, was the\r\nproper place to pursue their researches. No part of the island could\r\nhave been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to\r\nremain unknown. But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that\r\nCyrus Harding was obliged to conduct the exploration in a strictly\r\nmethodical manner.\r\n\r\nThe colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the\r\nvolcano, and which first received the waters of Falls River. There\r\nAyrton showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken refuge, and\r\nin which he had been imprisoned until his removal to the corral. This\r\ncavern was just as Ayrton had left it. They found there a considerable\r\nquantity of ammunition and provisions, conveyed thither by the convicts\r\nin order to form a reserve.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and\r\nother trees, was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of the\r\nsouthwestern spur, the colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the\r\npicturesque columns of basalt on the coast. Here the trees were fewer.\r\nStones took the place of grass. Goats and musmons gambolled among the\r\nrocks. Here began the barren part of the island. It could already be\r\nseen that, of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of Mount\r\nFranklin, three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the\r\ncorral, which bordered on the west on the Falls River valley, and on the\r\neast on the Red Creek valley. These two streams, which lower down became\r\nrivers by the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the\r\nsprings of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern\r\npart. As to the Mercy, it was more directly fed from ample springs\r\nconcealed under the cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by springs of\r\nthis nature, spreading in a thousand streamlets, that the soil of the\r\nSerpentine Peninsula was watered.\r\n\r\nNow, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have served as a\r\nretreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary\r\nfor life. But the settlers had already explored them, and in no part had\r\nthey discovered the presence of man.\r\n\r\nWas it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst of the\r\npiles of rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the streams of\r\nlava, that this dwelling and its occupant would be found?\r\n\r\nThe northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed solely of\r\ntwo valleys, wide, not very deep, without any appearance of vegetation,\r\nstrewn with masses of rock, paved with lava, and varied with great\r\nblocks of mineral. This region required a long and careful exploration.\r\nIt contained a thousand cavities, comfortless no doubt, but perfectly\r\nconcealed and difficult of access.\r\n\r\nThe colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the volcanic\r\nperiod, still black from the passage of the fire, and penetrated into\r\nthe depths of the mountain. They traversed these somber galleries,\r\nwaving lighted torches; they examined the smallest excavations; they\r\nsounded the shallowest depths, but all was dark and silent. It did\r\nnot appear that the foot of man had ever before trodden these ancient\r\npassages, or that his arm had ever displaced one of these blocks, which\r\nremained as the volcano had cast them up above the waters, at the time\r\nof the submersion of the island.\r\n\r\nHowever, although these passages appeared to be absolutely deserted, and\r\nthe obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged to confess that\r\nabsolute silence did not reign there.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending several\r\nhundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear\r\na deep rumbling noise, increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant\r\nmutterings, which indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires.\r\nSeveral times both listened, and they agreed that some chemical process\r\nwas taking place in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\n“Then the volcano is not totally extinct?” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“It is possible that since our exploration of the crater,” replied Cyrus\r\nHarding, “some change has occurred. Any volcano, although considered\r\nextinct, may evidently again burst forth.”\r\n\r\n“But if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred,” asked Spilett, “would\r\nthere not be some danger to Lincoln Island?”\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” answered the reporter. “The crater, that is to\r\nsay, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and lava, would\r\nescape, as it did formerly, by this customary outlet.”\r\n\r\n“Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts\r\nof the island!”\r\n\r\n“And why, my dear Spilett,” answered Cyrus Harding, “should it not\r\nfollow the road naturally traced out for it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, volcanoes are capricious,” returned the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Notice,” answered the engineer, “that the inclination of Mount Franklin\r\nfavors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are exploring just\r\nnow. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be necessary to change\r\nthe mountain’s center of gravity.”\r\n\r\n“But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,” observed\r\nGideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Always,” replied the engineer, “especially when the subterranean forces\r\nbegin to awake, as they risk meeting with some obstruction, after a long\r\nrest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing\r\nfor us, and it would be better that the volcano should not have the\r\nslightest desire to wake up. But we could not prevent it, could we? At\r\nany rate, even if it should occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would\r\nbe seriously threatened. Between them and the mountain, the ground\r\nis considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course\r\ntowards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring\r\nparts of Shark Gulf.”\r\n\r\n“We have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to indicate\r\nan approaching eruption,” said Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Harding, “not a vapor escapes from the crater, for it\r\nwas only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit. But it\r\nis probable that at the lower part of the chimney, time may have\r\naccumulated rocks, cinders, hardened lava, and that this valve of which\r\nI spoke, may at any time become overcharged. But at the first serious\r\neffort, every obstacle will disappear, and you may be certain, my dear\r\nSpilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler, nor the\r\nvolcano, which is the chimney, will burst under the pressure of gas.\r\nNevertheless, I repeat, it would be better that there should not be an\r\neruption.”\r\n\r\n“And yet we are not mistaken,” remarked the reporter. “Mutterings can be\r\ndistinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano!”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said the engineer, again listening attentively. “There\r\ncan be no doubt of it. A commotion is going on there, of which we can\r\nneither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their companions, to\r\nwhom they made known the state of affairs.\r\n\r\n“Very well!” cried Pencroft, “The volcano wants to play his pranks! Let\r\nhim try, if he likes! He will find his master!”\r\n\r\n“Who?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Our good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth for him,\r\nif he so much as pretends to open it!”\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, the sailor’s confidence in the tutelary deity of his\r\nisland was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power, manifested until\r\nnow in so many inexplicable ways, appeared to be unlimited; but also it\r\nknew how to escape the colonists’ most minute researches, for, in\r\nspite of all their efforts, in spite of the more than zeal,--the\r\nobstinacy,--with which they carried on their exploration, the retreat of\r\nthe mysterious being could not be discovered.\r\n\r\nFrom the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was\r\nextended to all the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most secret\r\nnooks were explored. The colonists even went the length of tapping every\r\nrock. The search was extended to the extreme verge of the mountain. It\r\nwas explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating\r\nthe first row of rocks, then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat, at\r\nthe bottom of which opened the crater.\r\n\r\nThey did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose depths\r\nthe rumbling could be distinctly heard. However, no sign of smoke or\r\nvapor, no heating of the rock, indicated an approaching eruption.\r\nBut neither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the\r\ncolonists find any traces of him of whom they were in search.\r\n\r\nTheir investigations were then directed to the downs. They carefully\r\nexamined the high lava-cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base to the crest,\r\nalthough it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf.\r\nNo one!--nothing!\r\n\r\nIndeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue uselessly\r\nexpended, so much energy producing no results, that somewhat of anger\r\nmingled with the discomfiture of Cyrus Harding and his companions.\r\n\r\nIt was now time to think of returning, for these researches could not be\r\nprolonged indefinitely. The colonists were certainly right in believing\r\nthat the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island,\r\nand the wildest fancies haunted their excited imaginations. Pencroft\r\nand Neb, particularly, were not contented with the mystery, but allowed\r\ntheir imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House, and by\r\nmeans of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the threshold of the\r\ndoor, they re-established communication between their habitation and the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nA month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third\r\nanniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nThree years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners from\r\nRichmond, and how often during those three years had they spoken of\r\ntheir country, always present in their thoughts!\r\n\r\nThey had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them it\r\nappeared impossible that the just cause of the North had not triumphed.\r\nBut what had been the incidents of this terrible war? How much blood had\r\nit not cost? How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?\r\nThey often spoke of these things, without as yet being able to foresee\r\nthe day when they would be permitted once more to see their country.\r\nTo return thither, were it but for a few days, to renew the social link\r\nwith the inhabited world, to establish a communication between their\r\nnative land and their island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the\r\nbest, portion of their existence in this colony, founded by them,\r\nand which would then be dependent on their country, was this a dream\r\nimpossible to realize?\r\n\r\nThere were only two ways of accomplishing it--either a ship must appear\r\noff Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a vessel\r\nstrong enough to sail to the nearest land.\r\n\r\n“Unless,” said Pencroft, “our good genius, himself provides us with the\r\nmeans of returning to our country.”\r\n\r\nAnd, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of 300 tons\r\nwas waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon, they would not\r\neven have made a gesture of surprise. In their state of mind nothing\r\nappeared improbable.\r\n\r\nBut Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine themselves to\r\nfact, and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel--a\r\nreally urgent work, since it was for the purpose of depositing, as\r\nsoon as possible, at Tabor Island a document indicating Ayrton’s new\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nAs the “Bonadventure” no longer existed, six months at least would\r\nbe required for the construction of a new vessel. Now winter was\r\napproaching, and the voyage would not be made before the following\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n“We have time to get everything ready for the fine season,” remarked\r\nthe engineer, who was consulting with Pencroft about these matters. “I\r\nthink, therefore, my friend, that since we have to rebuild our vessel\r\nit will be best to give her larger dimensions. The arrival of the Scotch\r\nyacht at Tabor Island is very uncertain. It may even be that, having\r\narrived several months ago, she has again sailed after having vainly\r\nsearched for some trace of Ayrton. Will it not then be best to build\r\na ship which, if necessary, could take us either to the Polynesian\r\nArchipelago or to New Zealand? What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I think, captain,” answered the sailor; “I think that you are as\r\ncapable of building a large vessel as a small one. Neither the wood nor\r\nthe tools are wanting. It is only a question of time.”\r\n\r\n“And how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to\r\n300 tons?” asked Harding.\r\n\r\n“Seven or eight months at least,” replied Pencroft. “But it must not be\r\nforgotten that winter is drawing near, and that in severe frost wood is\r\ndifficult to work. We must calculate on several weeks delay, and if our\r\nvessel is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Cyrus Harding, “that will be exactly the most favorable\r\ntime for undertaking a voyage of any importance, either to Tabor Island\r\nor to a more distant land.”\r\n\r\n“So it will, captain,” answered the sailor. “Make out your plans then;\r\nthe workmen are ready, and I imagine that Ayrton can lend us a good\r\nhelping hand.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists, having been consulted, approved the engineer’s plan,\r\nand it was, indeed, the best thing to be done. It is true that the\r\nconstruction of a ship of from two to three hundred tons would be great\r\nlabor, but the colonists had confidence in themselves, justified by\r\ntheir previous success.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and\r\nmaking the model. During this time his companions employed themselves in\r\nfelling and carting trees to furnish the ribs, timbers, and planks.\r\nThe forest of the Far West supplied the best oaks and elms. They took\r\nadvantage of the opening already made on their last excursion to form a\r\npracticable road, which they named the Far West Road, and the trees were\r\ncarried to the Chimneys, where the dockyard was established. As to\r\nthe road in question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction\r\nsomewhat capricious, but at the same time it facilitated the access to a\r\nlarge part of the Serpentine Peninsula.\r\n\r\nIt was important that the trees should be quickly felled and cut up, for\r\nthey could not be used while yet green, and some time was necessary to\r\nallow them to get seasoned. The carpenters, therefore, worked vigorously\r\nduring the month of April, which was troubled only by a few equinoctial\r\ngales of some violence. Master Jup aided them dexterously, either by\r\nclimbing to the top of a tree to fasten the ropes or by lending his\r\nstout shoulders to carry the lopped trunks.\r\n\r\nAll this timber was piled up under a large shed, built near the\r\nChimneys, and there awaited the time for use.\r\n\r\nThe month of April was tolerably fine, as October often is in the\r\nnorthern zone. At the same time other work was actively continued, and\r\nsoon all trace of devastation disappeared from the plateau of\r\nProspect Heights. The mill was rebuilt, and new buildings rose in the\r\npoultry-yard. It had appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions,\r\nfor the feathered population had increased considerably. The stable\r\nnow contained five onagers, four of which were well broken, and allowed\r\nthemselves to be either driven or ridden, and a little colt. The colony\r\nnow possessed a plow, to which the onagers were yoked like regular\r\nYorkshire or Kentucky oxen. The colonists divided their work, and their\r\narms never tired. Then who could have enjoyed better health than these\r\nworkers, and what good humor enlivened the evenings in Granite House as\r\nthey formed a thousand plans for the future!\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course Ayrton shared the common lot in every respect,\r\nand there was no longer any talk of his going to live at the corral.\r\nNevertheless he was still sad and reserved, and joined more in the work\r\nthan in the pleasures of his companions. But he was a valuable workman\r\nat need--strong, skilful, ingenious, intelligent. He was esteemed and\r\nloved by all, and he could not be ignorant of it.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned. Every other day one of\r\nthe settlers, driving the cart or mounted on an onager, went to look\r\nafter the flock of musmons and goats and bring back the supply of\r\nmilk required by Neb. These excursions at the same time afforded\r\nopportunities for hunting. Therefore Herbert and Gideon Spilett, with\r\nTop in front, traversed more often than their companions the road to\r\nthe corral, and with the capital guns which they carried, capybaras,\r\nagouties, kangaroos, and wild pigs for large game, ducks, grouse,\r\njacamars, and snipe for small game, were never wanting in the house.\r\nThe produce of the warren, of the oyster-bed, several turtles which were\r\ntaken, excellent salmon which came up the Mercy, vegetables from the\r\nplateau, wild fruit from the forest, were riches upon riches, and Neb,\r\nthe head cook, could scarcely by himself store them away.\r\n\r\nThe telegraphic wire between the corral and Granite House had of course\r\nbeen repaired, and it was worked whenever one or other of the settlers\r\nwas at the corral and found it necessary to spend the night there.\r\nBesides, the island was safe now and no attacks were to be feared, at\r\nany rate from men.\r\n\r\nHowever, that which had happened might happen again. A descent of\r\npirates, or even of escaped convicts, was always to be feared. It was\r\npossible that companions or accomplices of Bob Harvey had been in the\r\nsecret of his plans, and might be tempted to imitate him. The colonists,\r\ntherefore, were careful to observe the sea around the island, and every\r\nday their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by Union and Washington\r\nBays. When they went to the corral they examined the sea to the west\r\nwith no less attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended\r\nover a large section of the western horizon.\r\n\r\nNothing suspicious was discerned, but still it was necessary for them to\r\nbe on their guard.\r\n\r\nThe engineer one evening imparted to his friends a plan which he had\r\nconceived for fortifying the corral. It appeared prudent to him to\r\nheighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse, which,\r\nif necessary, the settlers could hold against the enemy. Granite House\r\nmight, by its very position, be considered impregnable; therefore the\r\ncorral with its buildings, its stores, and the animals it contained,\r\nwould always be the object of pirates, whoever they were, who might land\r\non the island, and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves\r\nup there they ought also to be able to defend themselves without any\r\ndisadvantage. This was a project which might be left for consideration,\r\nand they were, besides, obliged to put off its execution until the next\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nAbout the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel lay along the dockyard,\r\nand soon the stem and stern-post, mortised at each of its extremities,\r\nrose almost perpendicularly. The keel, of good oak, measured 110 feet\r\nin length, this allowing a width of five-and-twenty feet to the midship\r\nbeam. But this was all the carpenters could do before the arrival of the\r\nfrosts and bad weather. During the following week they fixed the first\r\nof the stern timbers, but were then obliged to suspend work.\r\n\r\nDuring the last days of the month the weather was extremely bad. The\r\nwind blew from the east, sometimes with the violence of a tempest. The\r\nengineer was somewhat uneasy on account of the dockyard shed--which\r\nbesides, he could not have established in any other place near to\r\nGranite House--for the islet only imperfectly sheltered the shore from\r\nthe fury of the open sea, and in great storms the waves beat against the\r\nvery foot of the granite cliff.\r\n\r\nBut, very fortunately, these fears were not realized. The wind shifted\r\nto the southeast, and there the beach of Granite House was completely\r\ncovered by Flotsam Point.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Ayrton, the most zealous workmen at the new vessel, pursued\r\ntheir labor as long as they could. They were not men to mind the wind\r\ntearing at their hair, nor the rain wetting them to the skin, and a blow\r\nfrom a hammer is worth just as much in bad as in fine weather. But when\r\na severe frost succeeded this wet period, the wood, its fibers acquiring\r\nthe hardness of iron, became extremely difficult to work, and about the\r\n10th of June shipbuilding was obliged to be entirely discontinued.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe\r\nwas the temperature during the winters of Lincoln Island. The cold was\r\ncomparable to that experienced in the States of New England, situated at\r\nalmost the same distance from the equator. In the northern hemisphere,\r\nor at any rate in the part occupied by British America and the north of\r\nthe United States, this phenomenon is explained by the flat conformation\r\nof the territories bordering on the pole, and on which there is no\r\nintumescence of the soil to oppose any obstacle to the north winds;\r\nhere, in Lincoln Island, this explanation would not suffice.\r\n\r\n“It has even been observed,” remarked Harding one day to his companions,\r\n“that in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions are less tried by\r\nthe cold than inland countries. I have often heard it asserted that the\r\nwinters of Lombardy, for example, are not less rigorous than those of\r\nScotland, which results from the sea restoring during the winter the\r\nheat which it received during the summer. Islands are, therefore, in a\r\nbetter situation for benefiting by this restitution.”\r\n\r\n“But then, Captain Harding,” asked Herbert, “why does Lincoln Island\r\nappear to escape the common law?”\r\n\r\n“That is difficult to explain,” answered the engineer. “However, I\r\nshould be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results from the\r\nsituation of the island in the Southern Hemisphere, which, as you know,\r\nmy boy, is colder than the Northern Hemisphere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Herbert, “and icebergs are met with in lower latitudes in\r\nthe south than in the north of the Pacific.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” remarked Pencroft, “and when I have been serving on\r\nboard whalers I have seen icebergs off Cape Horn.”\r\n\r\n“The severe cold experienced in Lincoln Island,” said Gideon Spilett,\r\n“may then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs\r\ncomparatively near to Lincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“Your opinion is very admissible indeed, my dear Spilett,” answered\r\nCyrus Harding, “and it is evidently to the proximity of icebergs that\r\nwe owe our rigorous winters. I would draw your attention also to an\r\nentirely physical cause, which renders the Southern colder than the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere. In fact, since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere\r\nduring the summer, it is necessarily more distant during the winter.\r\nThis explains then the excess of temperature in the two seasons, for, if\r\nwe find the winters very cold in Lincoln Island, we must not forget that\r\nthe summers here, on the contrary, are very hot.”\r\n\r\n“But why, if you please, captain,” asked Pencroft, knitting his brows,\r\n“why should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided? It isn’t\r\njust, that!”\r\n\r\n“Friend Pencroft,” answered the engineer, laughing, “whether just\r\nor not, we must submit to it, and here lies the reason for this\r\npeculiarity. The earth does not describe a circle around the sun, but\r\nan ellipse, as it must by the laws of rational mechanics. Now, the earth\r\noccupies one of the foci of the ellipse, and so at one point in its\r\ncourse is at its apogee, that is, at its farthest from the sun, and\r\nat another point it is at its perigee, or nearest to the sun. Now it\r\nhappens that it is during the winter of the southern countries that\r\nit is at its most distant point from the sun, and consequently, in a\r\nsituation for those regions to feel the greatest cold. Nothing can be\r\ndone to prevent that, and men, Pencroft, however learned they may be,\r\ncan never change anything of the cosmographical order established by God\r\nHimself.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” added Pencroft, “the world is very learned. What a big book,\r\ncaptain, might be made with all that is known!”\r\n\r\n“And what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!” answered\r\nHarding.\r\n\r\nAt last, for one reason or another, the month of June brought the cold\r\nwith its accustomed intensity, and the settlers were often confined to\r\nGranite House. Ah! how wearisome this imprisonment was to them, and more\r\nparticularly to Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said he to Neb one day, “I would give you by notarial\r\ndeed all the estates which will come to me some day, if you were a good\r\nenough fellow to go, no matter where, and subscribe to some newspaper\r\nfor me! Decidedly the thing that is most essential to my happiness is\r\nthe knowing every morning what has happened the day before in other\r\nplaces than this!”\r\n\r\nNeb began to laugh.\r\n\r\n“‘Pon my word,” he replied, “the only thing I think about is my daily\r\nwork!”\r\n\r\nThe truth was that indoors as well as out there was no want of work.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Lincoln Island was now at its highest point of prosperity,\r\nachieved by three years of continued hard work. The destruction of the\r\nbrig had been a new source of riches. Without speaking of the complete\r\nrig which would serve for the vessel now on the stocks, utensils and\r\ntools of all sorts, weapons and ammunition, clothes and instruments,\r\nwere now piled in the storerooms of Granite House. It had not even\r\nbeen necessary to resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt\r\nmaterials. Though the colonists had suffered from cold during their\r\nfirst winter, the bad season might now come without their having any\r\nreason to dread its severity. Linen was plentiful also, and besides,\r\nthey kept it with extreme care. From chloride of sodium, which is\r\nnothing else than sea salt, Cyrus Harding easily extracted the soda and\r\nchlorine. The soda, which it was easy to change into carbonate of soda,\r\nand the chlorine, of which he made chloride of lime, were employed for\r\nvarious domestic purposes, and especially in bleaching linen. Besides,\r\nthey did not wash more than four times a year, as was done by families\r\nin the olden times, and it may be added, that Pencroft and Gideon\r\nSpilett, while waiting for the postman to bring him his newspaper,\r\ndistinguished themselves as washermen.\r\n\r\nSo passed the winter months, June, July, and August. They were severe,\r\nand the average observations of the thermometer did not give more than\r\neight degrees of Fahrenheit. It was therefore lower in temperature than\r\nthe preceding winter. But then, what splendid fires blazed continually\r\non the hearths of Granite House, the smoke marking the granite wall with\r\nlong, zebra-like streaks! Fuel was not spared, as it grew naturally a\r\nfew steps from them. Besides, the chips of the wood destined for the\r\nconstruction of the ship enabled them to economize the coal, which\r\nrequired more trouble to transport.\r\n\r\nMen and animals were all well. Master Jup was a little chilly, it must\r\nbe confessed. This was perhaps his only weakness, and it was necessary\r\nto make him a well-padded dressing-gown. But what a servant he was,\r\nclever, zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet, not talkative, and\r\nhe might have been with reason proposed as a model for all his biped\r\nbrothers in the Old and New Worlds!\r\n\r\n“As for that,” said Pencroft, “when one has four hands at one’s service,\r\nof course one’s work ought to be done so much the better!”\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the intelligent creature did it well.\r\n\r\nDuring the seven months which had passed since the last researches made\r\nround the mountain, and during the month of September, which brought\r\nback fine weather, nothing was heard of the genius of the island. His\r\npower was not manifested in any way. It is true that it would have\r\nbeen superfluous, for no incident occurred to put the colonists to any\r\npainful trial.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding even observed that if by chance the communication between\r\nthe unknown and the tenants of Granite House had ever been established\r\nthrough the granite, and if Top’s instinct had as it were felt it, there\r\nwas no further sign of it during this period. The dog’s growling\r\nhad entirely ceased, as well as the uneasiness of the orang. The two\r\nfriends--for they were such--no longer prowled round the opening of the\r\ninner well, nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from\r\nthe first the engineer had noticed. But could he be sure that this was\r\nall that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never\r\narrive at a solution? Could he be certain that some conjuncture would\r\nnot occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene? who\r\ncould tell what the future might have in reserve?\r\n\r\nAt last the winter was ended, but an event, the consequences of which\r\nmight be serious occurred in the first days of the returning spring.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September, Cyrus Harding, having observed the crater, saw\r\nsmoke curling round the summit of the mountain, its first vapors rising\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nThe colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed in\r\nsilence at the summit of Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral layer\r\nheaped at the bottom of the crater. But would the subterranean fires\r\nprovoke any violent eruption? This was an event which could not be\r\nforeseen. However, even while admitting the possibility of an eruption,\r\nit was not probable that the whole of Lincoln Island would suffer from\r\nit. The flow of volcanic matter is not always disastrous, and the island\r\nhad already undergone this trial, as was shown by the streams of lava\r\nhardened on the northern slopes of the mountain. Besides, from the shape\r\nof the crater--the opening broken in the upper edge--the matter would be\r\nthrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island.\r\n\r\nHowever, the past did not necessarily answer for the future. Often, at\r\nthe summit of volcanoes, the old craters close and new ones open.\r\nThis had occurred in the two hemispheres--at Etna, Popocatepetl, at\r\nOrizabaand on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared.\r\nIn fact, an earthquake--a phenomenon which often accompanies volcanic\r\neruption--is enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain,\r\nand to open new outlets for the burning lava.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and, without\r\nexaggerating the state of things, he told them all the pros and cons.\r\nAfter all, they could not prevent it. It did not appear likely that\r\nGranite House would be threatened unless the ground was shaken by an\r\nearthquake. But the corral would be in great danger should a new crater\r\nopen in the southern side of Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\nFrom that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain,\r\nand it could even be perceived that it increased in height and\r\nthickness, without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes. The\r\nphenomenon was still concentrated in the lower part of the central\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the fine days work had been continued. The building of the\r\nvessel was hastened as much as possible, and, by means of the waterfall\r\non the shore, Cyrus Harding managed to establish an hydraulic sawmill,\r\nwhich rapidly cut up the trunks of trees into planks and joists. The\r\nmechanism of this apparatus was as simple as those used in the rustic\r\nsawmills of Norway. A first horizontal movement to move the piece of\r\nwood, a second vertical movement to move the saw--this was all that was\r\nwanted; and the engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders,\r\nand pulleys properly arranged. Towards the end of the month of September\r\nthe skeleton of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay\r\nin the dockyard. The ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all the\r\ntimbers having been sustained by a provisional band, the shape of the\r\nvessel could already be seen. The schooner, sharp in the bows, very\r\nslender in the after-part, would evidently be suitable for a long\r\nvoyage, if wanted; but laying the planking would still take a\r\nconsiderable time. Very fortunately, the iron work of the pirate brig\r\nhad been saved after the explosion. From the planks and injured ribs\r\nPencroft and Ayrton had extracted the bolts and a large quantity\r\nof copper nails. It was so much work saved for the smiths, but the\r\ncarpenters had much to do.\r\n\r\nShipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the haymaking,\r\nand the gathering in of the different crops on the plateau. This work\r\nfinished, every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner. When night\r\ncame the workmen were really quite exhausted. So as not to lose any\r\ntime they had changed the hours for their meals; they dined at twelve\r\no’clock, and only had their supper when daylight failed them. They then\r\nascended to Granite House, when they were always ready to go to bed.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some interesting\r\nsubject the hour for sleep was delayed for a time. The colonists then\r\nspoke of the future, and talked willingly of the changes which a voyage\r\nin the schooner to inhabited lands would make in their situation.\r\nBut always, in the midst of these plans, prevailed the thought of a\r\nsubsequent return to Lincoln Island. Never would they abandon this\r\ncolony, founded with so much labor and with such success, and to which\r\na communication with America would afford a fresh impetus. Pencroft and\r\nNeb especially hoped to end their days there.\r\n\r\n“Herbert,” said the sailor, “you will never abandon Lincoln Island?”\r\n\r\n“Never, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to stay\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“That was made up long ago, my boy,” answered Pencroft. “I shall expect\r\nyou. You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall make jolly\r\nchaps of your youngsters!”\r\n\r\n“That’s agreed,” replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“And you, Captain Harding,” resumed Pencroft enthusiastically, “you will\r\nbe still the governor of the island! Ah, how many inhabitants could it\r\nsupport? Ten thousand at least!”\r\n\r\nThey talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at last the\r\nreporter actually started a newspaper--the New Lincoln Herald!\r\n\r\nSo is man’s heart. The desire to perform a work which will endure, which\r\nwill survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living\r\ncreatures here below. It is this which has established his dominion, and\r\nthis it is which justifies it, over all the world.\r\n\r\nAfter that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their little\r\ndream of the future.\r\n\r\nAyrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord Glenarvan\r\nagain and show himself to all restored.\r\n\r\nOne evening, on the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged\r\nlater than usual. It was nine o’clock. Already, long badly concealed\r\nyawns gave warning of the hour of rest, and Pencroft was proceeding\r\ntowards his bed, when the electric bell, placed in the dining-room,\r\nsuddenly rang.\r\n\r\nAll were there, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Ayrton,\r\nPencroft, Neb. Therefore none of the colonists were at the corral.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding rose. His companions stared at each other, scarcely\r\nbelieving their ears.\r\n\r\n“What does that mean?” cried Neb. “Was it the devil who rang it?”\r\n\r\nNo one answered.\r\n\r\n“The weather is stormy,” observed Herbert. “Might not its influence of\r\nelectricity--”\r\n\r\nHerbert did not finish his phrase. The engineer, towards whom all eyes\r\nwere turned, shook his head negatively.\r\n\r\n“We must wait,” said Gideon Spilett. “If it is a signal, whoever it may\r\nbe who has made it, he will renew it.”\r\n\r\n“But who do you think it is?” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“Who?” answered Pencroft, “but he--”\r\n\r\nThe sailor’s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell.\r\n\r\nHarding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the corral:--\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”\r\n\r\nA few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial, gave this\r\nreply to the tenants of Granite House:--\r\n\r\n“Come to the corral immediately.”\r\n\r\n“At last!” exclaimed Harding.\r\n\r\nYes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The colonists’\r\nfatigue had disappeared before the tremendous interest which was about\r\nto urge them to the corral, and all wish for rest had ceased. Without\r\nhaving uttered a word, in a few moments they had left Granite House,\r\nand were standing on the beach. Jup and Top alone were left behind. They\r\ncould do without them.\r\n\r\nThe night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same time as\r\nthe sun. As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds formed a lowering\r\nand heavy vault, preventing any star rays. A few lightning flashes,\r\nreflections from a distant storm, illuminated the horizon.\r\n\r\nIt was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the\r\nisland itself. The night was very threatening.\r\n\r\nBut however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them from\r\nfinding the familiar road to the corral.\r\n\r\nThey ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau, passed\r\nthe bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the forest.\r\n\r\nThey walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions. There was\r\nno doubt but that they were now going to learn the long-searched-for\r\nanswer to the enigma, the name of that mysterious being, so deeply\r\nconcerned in their life, so generous in his influence, so powerful\r\nin his action! Must not this stranger have indeed mingled with their\r\nexistence, have known the smallest details, have heard all that was said\r\nin Granite House, to have been able always to act in the very nick of\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nEvery one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward. Under the\r\narch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road\r\ncould not be seen. Not a sound in the forest. Both animals and birds,\r\ninfluenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained motionless\r\nand silent. Not a breath disturbed the leaves. The footsteps of the\r\ncolonists alone resounded on the hardened ground.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of an hour the silence was only interrupted by\r\nthis remark from Pencroft:--\r\n\r\n“We ought to have brought a torch.”\r\n\r\nAnd by this reply from the engineer:--\r\n\r\n“We shall find one at the corral.”\r\n\r\nHarding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past\r\nnine. At forty-seven minutes past nine they had traversed three out of\r\nthe five miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral.\r\n\r\nAt that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined\r\nthe dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them. Evidently\r\nthe storm would not be long in bursting forth.\r\n\r\nThe flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant thunder\r\ngrowled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.\r\n\r\nThe colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some\r\nirresistible force.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they\r\nreached the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury.\r\n\r\nIn a minute the corral was crossed, and Harding stood before the hut.\r\n\r\nProbably the house was occupied by the stranger, since it was from\r\nthence that the telegram had been sent. However, no light shone through\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nThe engineer knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding opened the door, and the settlers entered the room, which\r\nwas perfectly dark. A light was struck by Neb, and in a few moments the\r\nlantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room.\r\n\r\nThere was no one there. Everything was in the state in which it had been\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n“Have we been deceived by an illusion?” murmured Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nNo! that was not possible! The telegram had clearly said,--\r\n\r\n“Come to the corral immediately.”\r\n\r\nThey approached the table specially devoted to the use of the wire.\r\nEverything was in order--the pile on the box containing it, as well as\r\nall the apparatus.\r\n\r\n“Who came here the last time?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“I did, captain,” answered Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“And that was--”\r\n\r\n“Four days ago.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! a note!” cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table.\r\n\r\nOn this paper were written these words in English:--\r\n\r\n“Follow the new wire.”\r\n\r\n“Forward!” cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had not been\r\nsent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat, communicating\r\ndirectly with Granite House by means of a supplementary wire joined to\r\nthe old one.\r\n\r\nNeb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral. The storm\r\nthen burst forth with tremendous violence. The interval between each\r\nlightning-flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly. The summit\r\nof the volcano, with its plume of vapor, could be seen by occasional\r\nflashes.\r\n\r\nThere was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral between\r\nthe house and the palisade; but the engineer, running straight to the\r\nfirst post, saw by the light of a flash a new wire hanging from the\r\nisolator to the ground.\r\n\r\n“There it is!” said he.\r\n\r\nThis wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an isolating\r\nsubstance like a submarine cable, so as to assure the free transmission\r\nof the current. It appeared to pass through the wood and the southern\r\nspurs of the mountain, and consequently it ran towards the west.\r\n\r\n“Follow it!” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nAnd the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the wire.\r\n\r\nThe thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could\r\nbe heard. However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to get\r\nforward as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between\r\nthe corral valley and that of Falls River, which they crossed at its\r\nnarrowest part. The wire, sometimes stretched over the lower branches\r\nof the trees, sometimes lying on the ground, guided them surely. The\r\nengineer had supposed that the wire would perhaps stop at the bottom of\r\nthe valley, and that the stranger’s retreat would be there.\r\n\r\nNothing of the sort. They were obliged to ascend the south-western spur,\r\nand re-descend on that arid plateau terminated by the strangely-wild\r\nbasalt cliff. From time to time one of the colonists stooped down and\r\nfelt for the wire with his hands; but there was now no doubt that the\r\nwire was running directly towards the sea. There, to a certainty, in the\r\ndepths of those rocks, was the dwelling so long sought for in vain.\r\n\r\nThe sky was literally on fire. Flash succeeded flash. Several struck the\r\nsummit of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke. It appeared there\r\nas if the mountain was vomiting flame. At a few minutes to eleven the\r\ncolonists arrived on the high cliff overlooking the ocean to the west.\r\nThe wind had risen. The surf roared 500 feet below.\r\n\r\nHarding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the corral.\r\n\r\nAt this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the steep side\r\nof a narrow ravine. The settlers followed it at the risk of occasioning\r\na fall of the slightly-balanced rocks, and being dashed into the sea.\r\nThe descent was extremely perilous, but they did not think of the\r\ndanger; they were no longer masters of themselves, and an irresistible\r\nattraction drew them towards this mysterious place as the magnet draws\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even in\r\nbroad daylight would have been considered impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed\r\nthrough the gleams of light. Harding was first--Ayrton last. On they\r\nwent, step by step. Now they slid over the slippery rock; then they\r\nstruggled to their feet and scrambled on.\r\n\r\nAt last the wire touched the rocks on the beach. The colonists had\r\nreached the bottom of the basalt cliff.\r\n\r\nThere appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with\r\nthe sea. The settlers followed the wire along it. They had not gone a\r\nhundred paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nHis companions were stupefied.\r\n\r\nA cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them! Must\r\nthey then plunge beneath the water and seek there for some submarine\r\ncavern? In their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it.\r\n\r\nThe engineer stopped them.\r\n\r\nHe led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there--\r\n\r\n“We must wait,” said he. “The tide is high. At low water the way will be\r\nopen.”\r\n\r\n“But what can make you think-” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“He would not have called us if the means had been wanting to enable us\r\nto reach him!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that no\r\nobjection was raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was quite\r\npossible that an opening, practicable at low water, though hidden now by\r\nthe high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.\r\n\r\nThere was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently crouching\r\nin a deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The thunder was\r\nre-echoed among the rocks with a grand sonorousness.\r\n\r\nThe colonists’ emotion was great. A thousand strange and extraordinary\r\nideas crossed their brains, and they expected some grand and superhuman\r\napparition, which alone could come up to the notion they had formed of\r\nthe mysterious genius of the island.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the beach to\r\nreconnoiter.\r\n\r\nThe engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense excavation\r\ncould be seen under the water. There the wire, bending at a right angle,\r\nentered the yawning gulf.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,--\r\n\r\n“In an hour the opening will be practicable.”\r\n\r\n“It is there, then?” said Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Did you doubt it?” returned Harding.\r\n\r\n“But this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,”\r\n observed Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Either the cavern will be completely dry,” replied Harding, “and in\r\nthat case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be dry, and some\r\nmeans of transport will be put at our disposal.”\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. All climbed down through the rain to the level of the\r\nsea. There was now eight feet of the opening above the water. It was\r\nlike the arch of a bridge, under which rushed the foaming water.\r\n\r\nLeaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the\r\nwater. He drew it towards him. It was a boat, moored to some interior\r\nprojection of the cave. This boat was iron-plated. Two oars lay at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n“Jump in!” said Harding.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the settlers were in the boat. Neb and Ayrton took the\r\noars, Pencroft the rudder. Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the lantern,\r\nlighted the way.\r\n\r\nThe elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed, suddenly\r\nrose; but the darkness was too deep, and the light of the lantern too\r\nslight, for either the extent, length, height, or depth of the cave to\r\nbe ascertained. Solemn silence reigned in this basaltic cavern. Not a\r\nsound could penetrate into it, even the thunder peals could not pierce\r\nits thick sides.\r\n\r\nSuch immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural crypts\r\ndating from the geological epoch of the globe. Some are filled by the\r\nsea; others contain entire lakes in their sides. Such is Fingal’s Cave,\r\nin the island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides; such are the caves of\r\nMorgat, in the bay of Douarnenez, in Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio,\r\nin Corsica, those of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such are the immense Mammoth\r\ncaverns in Kentucky, 500 feet in height, and more than twenty miles in\r\nlength! In many parts of the globe, nature has excavated these caverns,\r\nand preserved them for the admiration of man.\r\n\r\nDid the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the\r\ncenter of the island? For a quarter of an hour the boat had been\r\nadvancing, making detours, indicated to Pencroft by the engineer in\r\nshort sentences, when all at once,--\r\n\r\n“More to the right!” he commanded.\r\n\r\nThe boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall. The\r\nengineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side.\r\n\r\nThe wire was there fastened to the rock.\r\n\r\n“Forward!” said Harding.\r\n\r\nAnd the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards.\r\n\r\nOn they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of\r\nhalf-a-mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when\r\nHarding’s voice was again heard.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” said he.\r\n\r\nThe boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light\r\nilluminating the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of the\r\nisland, of which nothing had ever led them to suspect the existence.\r\n\r\nAt a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported on basalt\r\nshafts. Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on the columns\r\nerected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of the formation of\r\nthe globe. The basalt pillars, fitted one into the other, measured\r\nfrom forty to fifty feet in height, and the water, calm in spite of the\r\ntumult outside, washed their base. The brilliant focus of light, pointed\r\nout by the engineer, touched every point of rocks, and flooded the walls\r\nwith light.\r\n\r\nBy reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so that the\r\nboat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones. They could\r\nnot be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing\r\nnucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles, all the\r\nprojections of the cavern. This light proceeded from an electric source,\r\nand its white color betrayed its origin. It was the sun of this cave,\r\nand it filled it entirely.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the water,\r\ncausing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged forward towards\r\nthe light, which was now not more than half a cable’s length distant.\r\n\r\nAt this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly 350\r\nfeet, and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous basaltic\r\nwall, blocking up any issue on that side. The cavern widened here\r\nconsiderably, the sea forming a little lake. But the roof, the side\r\nwalls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks, were flooded with\r\nthe electric fluid, so that the brilliancy belonged to them, and as if\r\nthe light issued from them.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on the\r\nsurface of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which issued\r\nfrom it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a white heat.\r\nThis apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale, was about 250\r\nfeet long, and rose about ten or twelve above the water.\r\n\r\nThe boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the bows. He\r\ngazed, a prey to violent excitement. Then, all at once, seizing the\r\nreporter’s arm,--\r\n\r\n“It is he! It can only be he!” he cried, “he!--”\r\n\r\nThen, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon Spilett\r\nalone could hear.\r\n\r\nThe reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful effect\r\nupon him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,--\r\n\r\n“He! an outlawed man!”\r\n\r\n“He!” said Harding.\r\n\r\nAt the engineer’s command the boat approached this singular floating\r\napparatus. The boat touched the left side, from which escaped a ray of\r\nlight through a thick glass.\r\n\r\nHarding and his companions mounted on the platform. An open hatchway was\r\nthere. All darted down the opening.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity. At the\r\nend of this deck was a door, which Harding opened.\r\n\r\nA richly-ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists, was joined\r\nto a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the library a large door, also shut, was opened by the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nAn immense saloon--a sort of museum, in which were heaped up, with\r\nall the treasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of\r\nindustry--appeared before the eyes of the colonists, who almost thought\r\nthemselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment.\r\n\r\nStretched on a rich sofa they saw a man, who did not appear to notice\r\ntheir presence.\r\n\r\nThen Harding raised his voice, and to the extreme surprise of his\r\ncompanions, he uttered these words,--\r\n\r\n“Captain Nemo, you asked for us! We are here.--”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nAt these words the reclining figure rose, and the electric light fell\r\nupon his countenance; a magnificent head, the forehead high, the glance\r\ncommanding, beard white, hair abundant and falling over the shoulders.\r\n\r\nHis hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just\r\nrisen. He appeared perfectly calm. It was evident that his strength had\r\nbeen gradually undermined by illness, but his voice seemed yet powerful,\r\nas he said in English, and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise,--\r\n\r\n“Sir, I have no name.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, I know you!” replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer, as though he\r\nwere about to annihilate him.\r\n\r\nThen, falling back amid the pillows of the divan,--\r\n\r\n“After all, what matters now?” he murmured; “I am dying!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his\r\nhand--it was of a feverish heat. Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb\r\nstood respectfully apart in an angle of the magnificent saloon, whose\r\natmosphere was saturated with the electric fluid.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the engineer and\r\nthe reporter to be seated.\r\n\r\nAll regarded him with profound emotion. Before them they beheld that\r\nbeing whom they had styled the “genius of the island,” the powerful\r\nprotector whose intervention, in so many circumstances, had been so\r\nefficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed such a debt of gratitude!\r\nTheir eyes beheld a man only, and a man at the point of death, where\r\nPencroft and Neb had expected to find an almost supernatural being!\r\n\r\nBut how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain Nemo? why\r\nhad the latter so suddenly risen on hearing this name uttered, a name\r\nwhich he had believed known to none?--\r\n\r\nThe captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning on his\r\narm, he regarded the engineer, seated near him.\r\n\r\n“You know the name I formerly bore, sir?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I do,” answered Cyrus Harding, “and also that of this wonderful\r\nsubmarine vessel--”\r\n\r\n“The ‘Nautilus’?” said the captain, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Nautilus.’”\r\n\r\n“But do you--do you know who I am?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“It is nevertheless many years since I have held any communication with\r\nthe inhabited world; three long years have I passed in the depth of\r\nthe sea, the only place where I have found liberty! Who then can have\r\nbetrayed my secret?”\r\n\r\n“A man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who,\r\nconsequently, cannot be accused of treachery.”\r\n\r\n“The Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen years\r\nsince?”\r\n\r\n“The same.”\r\n\r\n“He and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the\r\nmidst of which the ‘Nautilus’ was struggling?”\r\n\r\n“They escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of ‘Twenty\r\nThousand Leagues Under the Sea,’ which contains your history.”\r\n\r\n“The history of a few months only of my life!” interrupted the captain\r\nimpetuously.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” answered Cyrus Harding, “but a few months of that strange\r\nlife have sufficed to make you known.”\r\n\r\n“As a great criminal, doubtless!” said Captain Nemo, a haughty smile\r\ncurling his lips. “Yes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against humanity!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer was silent.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir?”\r\n\r\n“It is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo,” answered Cyrus Harding,\r\n“at any rate as regards your past life. I am, with the rest of the\r\nworld, ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange\r\nmode of existence, and I cannot judge of effects without knowing their\r\ncauses; but what I do know is, that a beneficent hand has constantly\r\nprotected us since our arrival on Lincoln Island, that we all owe our\r\nlives to a good, generous, and powerful being, and that this being so\r\npowerful, good and generous, Captain Nemo, is yourself!”\r\n\r\n“It is I,” answered the captain simply.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn near, and\r\nthe gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express\r\nitself in their gestures and words.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which betrayed more\r\nemotion than he doubtless intended to show.\r\n\r\n“Wait till you have heard all,” he said.\r\n\r\nAnd the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHis narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his whole\r\nremaining energy to arrive at the end. He was evidently contending\r\nagainst extreme weakness. Several times Cyrus Harding entreated him to\r\nrepose for a while, but he shook his head as a man to whom the morrow\r\nmay never come, and when the reporter offered his assistance,--\r\n\r\n“It is useless,” he said; “my hours are numbered.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of the\r\nthen independent territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him, when ten\r\nyears of age, to Europe, in order that he might receive an education\r\nin all respects complete, and in the hopes that by his talents and\r\nknowledge he might one day take a leading part in raising his long\r\ndegraded and heathen country to a level with the nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar, endowed by\r\nNature with her richest gifts of intellect, accumulated knowledge of\r\nevery kind, and in science, literature, and art his researches were\r\nextensive and profound.\r\n\r\nHe traveled over the whole of Europe. His rank and fortune caused him to\r\nbe everywhere sought after; but the pleasures of the world had for him\r\nno attractions. Though young and possessed of every personal advantage,\r\nhe was ever grave--somber even--devoured by an unquenchable thirst for\r\nknowledge, and cherishing in the recesses of his heart the hope that\r\nhe might become a great and powerful ruler of a free and enlightened\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nStill, for long the love of science triumphed over all other feelings.\r\nHe became an artist deeply impressed by the marvels of art, a\r\nphilosopher to whom no one of the higher sciences was unknown, a\r\nstatesman versed in the policy of European courts. To the eyes of those\r\nwho observed him superficially he might have passed for one of those\r\ncosmopolitans, curious of knowledge, but disdaining action; one of those\r\nopulent travelers, haughty and cynical, who move incessantly from place\r\nto place, and are of no country.\r\n\r\nThe history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under the title\r\nof “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.” Here, therefore, will apply\r\nthe observation already made as to the adventures of Ayrton with regard\r\nto the discrepancy of dates. Readers should therefore refer to the note\r\nalready published on this point.\r\n\r\nThis artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still cherishing\r\nthe hope instilled into him from his earliest days.\r\n\r\nPrince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a\r\nnoble Indian lady, who was imbued with an ambition not less ardent than\r\nthat by which he was inspired. Two children were born to them, whom they\r\ntenderly loved. But domestic happiness did not prevent him from seeking\r\nto carry out the object at which he aimed. He waited an opportunity. At\r\nlength, as he vainly fancied, it presented itself.\r\n\r\nInstigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and more\r\nunscrupulous than he was, the people of India were persuaded that they\r\nmight successfully rise against their English rulers, who had brought\r\nthem out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and misery, and had\r\nestablished peace and prosperity in their country. Their ignorance and\r\ngross superstition made them the facile tools of their designing chiefs.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out. Prince Dakkar, under the\r\nbelief that he should thereby have the opportunity of attaining the\r\nobject of his long-cherished ambition, was easily drawn into it. He\r\nforthwith devoted his talents and wealth to the service of this cause.\r\nHe aided it in person; he fought in the front ranks; he risked his life\r\nequally with the humblest of the wretched and misguided fanatics; he was\r\nten times wounded in twenty engagements, seeking death but finding it\r\nnot, but at length the sanguinary rebels were utterly defeated, and the\r\natrocious mutiny was brought to an end.\r\n\r\nNever before had the British power in India been exposed to such danger,\r\nand if, as they had hoped, the sepoys had received assistance from\r\nwithout, the influence and supremacy in Asia of the United Kingdom would\r\nhave been a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known. He had fought\r\nopenly and without concealment. A price was set upon his head, but he\r\nmanaged to escape from his pursuers.\r\n\r\nCivilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards.\r\nThe sepoys were vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of old fell again\r\nunder the rule of England.\r\n\r\nPrince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to the\r\nmountain fastnesses of Bundelkund. There, alone in the world, overcome\r\nby disappointment at the destruction of all his vain hopes, a prey\r\nto profound disgust for all human beings, filled with hatred of the\r\ncivilized world, he realized the wreck of his fortune, assembled some\r\nscore of his most faithful companions, and one day disappeared, leaving\r\nno trace behind.\r\n\r\nWhere, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited\r\nearth? Under the waves, in the depths of the ocean, where none could\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe warrior became the man of science. Upon a deserted island of the\r\nPacific he established his dockyard, and there a submarine vessel was\r\nconstructed from his designs. By methods which will at some future\r\nday be revealed he had rendered subservient the illimitable forces of\r\nelectricity, which, extracted from inexhaustible sources, was employed\r\nfor all the requirements of his floating equipage, as a moving,\r\nlighting, and heating agent. The sea, with its countless treasures, its\r\nmyriads of fish, its numberless wrecks, its enormous mammalia, and not\r\nonly all that nature supplied, but also all that man had lost in its\r\ndepths, sufficed for every want of the prince and his crew--and thus was\r\nhis most ardent desire accomplished, never again to hold communication\r\nwith the earth. He named his submarine vessel the “Nautilus,” called\r\nhimself simply Captain Nemo, and disappeared beneath the seas.\r\n\r\nDuring many years this strange being visited every ocean, from pole to\r\npole. Outcast of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered\r\nincalculable treasures. The millions lost in the Bay of Vigo, in 1702,\r\nby the galleons of Spain, furnished him with a mine of inexhaustible\r\nriches which he devoted always, anonymously, in favor of those nations\r\nwho fought for the independence of their country.\r\n\r\n  (This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were, in\r\n   fact, largely assisted by Captain Nemo.)\r\n\r\nFor long, however, he had held no communication with his\r\nfellow-creatures, when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866,\r\nthree men were cast on board his vessel. They were a French professor,\r\nhis servant, and a Canadian fisherman. These three men had been hurled\r\noverboard by a collision which had taken place between the “Nautilus”\r\n and the United States frigate “Abraham Lincoln,” which had chased her.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo learned from this professor that the “Nautilus,” taken now\r\nfor a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel\r\ncarrying a crew of pirates, was sought for in every sea.\r\n\r\nHe might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance\r\nhad brought them in contact with his mysterious existence. Instead of\r\ndoing this he kept them prisoners, and during seven months they were\r\nenabled to behold all the wonders of a voyage of twenty thousand leagues\r\nunder the sea.\r\n\r\nOne day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of\r\nthe past history of Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping in one of the\r\n“Nautilus’s” boats. But as at this time the “Nautilus” was drawn into\r\nthe vortex of the maelstrom, off the coast of Norway, the captain\r\nnaturally believed that the fugitives, engulfed in that frightful\r\nwhirlpool, found their death at the bottom of the abyss. He was unaware\r\nthat the Frenchman and his two companions had been miraculously cast\r\non shore, that the fishermen of the Lofoten Islands had rendered\r\nthem assistance, and that the professor, on his return to France, had\r\npublished that work in which seven months of the strange and eventful\r\nnavigation of the “Nautilus” were narrated and exposed to the curiosity\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus,\r\ntraversing every sea. But one by one his companions died, and found\r\ntheir last resting-place in their cemetery of coral, in the bed of the\r\nPacific. At last Captain Nemo remained the solitary survivor of all\r\nthose who had taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nHe was now sixty years of age. Although alone, he succeeded in\r\nnavigating the “Nautilus” towards one of those submarine caverns which\r\nhad sometimes served him as a harbor.\r\n\r\nOne of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at this\r\nmoment furnished an asylum to the “Nautilus.”\r\n\r\nThe captain had now remained there six years, navigating the ocean no\r\nlonger, but awaiting death, and that moment when he should rejoin his\r\nformer companions, when by chance he observed the descent of the balloon\r\nwhich carried the prisoners of the Confederates. Clad in his diving\r\ndress he was walking beneath the water at a few cables’ length from the\r\nshore of the island, when the engineer had been thrown into the sea.\r\nMoved by a feeling of compassion the captain saved Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five castaways;\r\nbut his harbor refuge was closed, for in consequence of an elevation of\r\nthe basalt, produced by the influence of volcanic action, he could\r\nno longer pass through the entrance of the vault. Though there was\r\nsufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar,\r\nthere was not enough for the “Nautilus,” whose draught of water was\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain. He observed these men\r\nthrown without resources upon a desert island, but had no wish to be\r\nhimself discovered by them. By degrees he became interested in their\r\nefforts when he saw them honest, energetic, and bound to each other by\r\nthe ties of friendship. As if despite his wishes, he penetrated all the\r\nsecrets of their existence. By means of the diving dress he could easily\r\nreach the well in the interior of Granite House, and climbing by the\r\nprojections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they\r\nrecounted the past, and studied the present and future. He learned from\r\nthem the tremendous conflict of America with America itself, for the\r\nabolition of slavery. Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile Captain\r\nNemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding. It was he also who had brought\r\nback the dog to the Chimneys, who rescued Top from the waters of the\r\nlake, who caused to fall at Flotsam Point the case containing so many\r\nthings useful to the colonists, who conveyed the canoe back into the\r\nstream of the Mercy, who cast the cord from the top of Granite House at\r\nthe time of the attack by the baboons, who made known the presence\r\nof Ayrton upon Tabor Island, by means of the document enclosed in the\r\nbottle, who caused the explosion of the brig by the shock of a torpedo\r\nplaced at the bottom of the canal, who saved Herbert from certain death\r\nby bringing the sulphate of quinine; and finally, it was he who had\r\nkilled the convicts with the electric balls, of which he possessed the\r\nsecret, and which he employed in the chase of submarine creatures. Thus\r\nwere explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences, and which\r\nall proved the generosity and power of the captain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his proteges\r\nstill further. There yet remained much useful advice to give them, and,\r\nhis heart being softened by the approach of death, he invited, as we are\r\naware, the colonists of Granite House to visit the “Nautilus,” by means\r\nof a wire which connected it with the corral. Possibly he would not\r\nhave done this had he been aware that Cyrus Harding was sufficiently\r\nacquainted with his history to address him by the name of Nemo.\r\n\r\nThe captain concluded the narrative of his life. Cyrus Harding then\r\nspoke; he recalled all the incidents which had exercised so beneficent\r\nan influence upon the colony, and in the names of his companions and\r\nhimself thanked the generous being to whom they owed so much.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be absorbed\r\nby one idea, and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,--\r\n\r\n“Now, sir,” said he, “now that you know my history, your judgment!”\r\n\r\nIn saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important incident\r\nwitnessed by the three strangers thrown on board his vessel, and which\r\nthe French professor had related in his work, causing a profound and\r\nterrible sensation. Some days previous to the flight of the professor\r\nand his two companions, the “Nautilus,” being chased by a frigate in the\r\nnorth of the Atlantic had hurled herself as a ram upon this frigate, and\r\nsunk her without mercy.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding understood the captain’s allusion, and was silent.\r\n\r\n“It was an enemy’s frigate,” exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed for\r\nan instant into the Prince Dakkar, “an enemy’s frigate! It was she who\r\nattacked me--I was in a narrow and shallow bay--the frigate barred my\r\nway--and I sank her!”\r\n\r\nA few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,--\r\n\r\n“What think you of my life, gentlemen?”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and replied\r\ngravely, “Sir, your error was in supposing that the past can be\r\nresuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress. It is one\r\nof those errors which some admire, others blame; which God alone can\r\njudge. He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be\r\nright may be an enemy, but retains our esteem. Your error is one that\r\nwe may admire, and your name has nothing to fear from the judgment of\r\nhistory, which does not condemn heroic folly, but its results.”\r\n\r\nThe old man’s breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to\r\nheaven,--\r\n\r\n“Was I wrong, or in the right?” he murmured.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding replied, “All great actions return to God, from whom they\r\nare derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn\r\nyour loss.”\r\n\r\nHerbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and kissed\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nA tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man. “My child,” he said, “may\r\nGod bless you!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\nDay had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the\r\ncavern. It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the sea. But the\r\nartificial light, which escaped in long streams from the skylights of\r\nthe “Nautilus” was as vivid as before, and the sheet of water shone\r\naround the floating vessel.\r\n\r\nAn extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen back\r\nupon the divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to Granite\r\nHouse, for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those\r\nmarvels of the “Nautilus” which millions could not have purchased, and\r\nto wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching.\r\n\r\nDuring a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost\r\nunconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed\r\nthe condition of the dying man. It was apparent that his strength was\r\ngradually diminishing. That frame, once so robust, was now but the\r\nfragile tenement of a departing soul. All of life was concentrated in\r\nthe heart and head.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible to\r\nrender any aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved, be\r\nprolonged for some days? He himself had said that no remedy could\r\navail, and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had for him no\r\nterrors.\r\n\r\n“We can do nothing,” said Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“But of what is he dying?” asked Pencroft.\r\n\r\n“Life is simply fading out,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said the sailor, “if we move him into the open air, and\r\nthe light of the sun, he might perhaps recover.”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroft,” answered the engineer, “it is useless to attempt it.\r\nBesides, Captain Nemo would never consent to leave his vessel. He\r\nhas lived for a dozen years on board the ‘Nautilus,’ and on board the\r\n‘Nautilus’ he desires to die.”\r\n\r\nWithout doubt Captain Nemo heard Cyrus Harding’s reply, for he raised\r\nhimself slightly, and in a voice more feeble, but always intelligible,--\r\n\r\n“You are right, sir,” he said. “I shall die here--it is my wish; and\r\ntherefore I have a request to make of you.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions had drawn near the divan, and now\r\narranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThey saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon, lighted\r\nby the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous\r\nceiling. He surveyed, one after the other, the pictures hanging from\r\nthe splendid tapestries of the partitions, the chef-d’oeuvres of the\r\nItalian, Flemish, French, and Spanish masters; the statues of marble and\r\nbronze on their pedestals; the magnificent organ, leaning against the\r\nafter-partition; the aquarium, in which bloomed the most wonderful\r\nproductions of the sea--marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls\r\nof inestimable value; and, finally, his eyes rested on this device,\r\ninscribed over the pediment of the museum--the motto of the “Nautilus”--\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mobilis in mobile.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHis glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces\r\nof art and of nature, to which he had limited his horizon during a\r\nsojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding respected the captain’s silence, and waited till he should\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes, during which, doubtless, he passed in review his\r\nwhole life, Captain Nemo turned to the colonists and said,\r\n\r\n“You consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to me?”\r\n\r\n“Captain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong yours.”\r\n\r\n“Promise, then,” continued Captain Nemo, “to carry out my last wishes,\r\nand I shall be repaid for all I have done for you.”\r\n\r\n“We promise,” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nAnd by this promise he bound both himself and his companions.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” resumed the captain, “to-morrow I shall be dead.”\r\n\r\nHerbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the captain\r\narrested him.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the ‘Nautilus.’\r\nIt is my grave! All my friends repose in the depths of the ocean; their\r\nresting-place shall be mine.”\r\n\r\nThese words were received with profound silence.\r\n\r\n“Pay attention to my wishes,” he continued. “The ‘Nautilus’ is\r\nimprisoned in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up; but,\r\nalthough egress is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in the\r\nabyss, and there bury my remains.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding,” continued the captain,\r\n“yourself and companions will leave the ‘Nautilus,’ for all the\r\ntreasures it contains must perish with me. One token alone will remain\r\nwith you of Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now acquainted.\r\nThat coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions,\r\nmost of them mementoes of the time when, husband and father, I thought\r\nhappiness possible for me, and a collection of pearls gathered by my\r\nfriends and myself in the depths of the ocean. Of this treasure at a\r\nfuture day, you may make good use. In the hands of such men as yourself\r\nand your comrades, Captain Harding, money will never be a source of\r\ndanger. From on high I shall still participate in your enterprises, and\r\nI fear not but that they will prosper.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments’ repose, necessitated by his extreme weakness,\r\nCaptain Nemo continued,--\r\n\r\n“To-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon, of which\r\nyou will close the door; then you will ascend on to the deck of the\r\n‘Nautilus,’ and you will lower the mainhatch so as entirely to close the\r\nvessel.”\r\n\r\n“It shall be done, captain,” answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Good. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you hither; but,\r\nbefore leaving the ‘Nautilus,’ go to the stern and there open two large\r\nstop-cocks which you will find upon the water-line. The water will\r\npenetrate into the reservoirs, and the ‘Nautilus’ will gradually sink\r\nbeneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss.”\r\n\r\nAnd comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain added,--\r\n\r\n“Fear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!”\r\n\r\nNeither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any\r\nobservation to Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and they\r\nhad nothing to do but to conform to them.\r\n\r\n“I have your promise, gentlemen?” added Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\n“You have, captain,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\nThe captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them to leave\r\nhim for some hours. Gideon Spilett wished to remain near him, in the\r\nevent of a crisis coming on, but the dying man refused, saying, “I shall\r\nlive until to-morrow, sir.”\r\n\r\nAll left the saloon, passed through the library and the dining-room, and\r\narrived forward, in the machine-room where the electrical apparatus was\r\nestablished, which supplied not only heat and light, but the mechanical\r\npower of the “Nautilus.”\r\n\r\nThe “Nautilus” was a masterpiece containing masterpieces within itself,\r\nand the engineer was struck with astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above\r\nthe water. There they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering, which\r\nprotected a kind of large eye, from which flashed forth light. Behind\r\nthis eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder, and\r\nin which was stationed the helmsman, when he navigated the “Nautilus”\r\n over the bed of the ocean, which the electric rays would evidently light\r\nup to a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for they\r\nwere vividly impressed by what they had just seen and heard, and their\r\nhearts were deeply touched by the thought that he whose arm had so often\r\naided them, the protector whom they had known but a few hours, was at\r\nthe point of death.\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events\r\nof this, so to speak, extra-human existence, the character of Prince\r\nDakkar would ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never\r\nefface.\r\n\r\n“What a man!” said Pencroft. “Is it possible that he can have lived at\r\nthe bottom of the sea? And it seems to me that perhaps he has not found\r\npeace there any more than elsewhere!”\r\n\r\n“The ‘Nautilus,’” observed Ayrton, “might have enabled us to leave\r\nLincoln Island and reach some inhabited country.”\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!” exclaimed Pencroft, “I for one would never risk myself\r\nin such a craft. To sail on the seas, good, but under the seas, never!”\r\n\r\n“I believe, Pencroft,” answered the reporter, “that the navigation of a\r\nsubmarine vessel such as the ‘Nautilus’ ought to be very easy, and that\r\nwe should soon become accustomed to it. There would be no storms, no\r\nlee-shore to fear. At some feet beneath the surface the waters of the\r\nocean are as calm as those of a lake.”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” replied the sailor, “but I prefer a gale of wind on\r\nboard a well-found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea, and not\r\nbeneath it.”\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said the engineer, “it is useless, at any rate as regards\r\nthe ‘Nautilus,’ to discuss the question of submarine vessels. The\r\n‘Nautilus’ is not ours, and we have not the right to dispose of it.\r\nMoreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it. Independently of\r\nthe fact that it would be impossible to get it out of this cavern, whose\r\nentrance is now closed by the uprising of the basaltic rocks, Captain\r\nNemo’s wish is that it shall be buried with him. His wish is our law,\r\nand we will fulfil it.”\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his\r\ncompanions again descended to the interior of the “Nautilus.” There they\r\ntook some refreshment and returned to the saloon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had\r\novercome him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint smile\r\neven curled his lips.\r\n\r\nThe colonists drew around him.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said the captain, “you are brave and honest men. You\r\nhave devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I observed\r\nyour conduct. I have esteemed you--I esteem you still! Your hand, Mr.\r\nHarding.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n“It is well!” he murmured.\r\n\r\nHe resumed,--\r\n\r\n“But enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves, and this\r\nLincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now desire to\r\nleave it?”\r\n\r\n“To return, captain!” answered Pencroft quickly.\r\n\r\n“To return, Pencroft?” said the captain, with a smile. “I know, it is\r\ntrue, your love for this island. You have helped to make it what it now\r\nis, and it seems to you a paradise!”\r\n\r\n“Our project, captain,” interposed Cyrus Harding, “is to annex it to the\r\nUnited States, and to establish for our shipping a port so fortunately\r\nsituated in this part of the Pacific.”\r\n\r\n“Your thoughts are with your country, gentlemen,” continued the captain;\r\n“your toils are for her prosperity and glory. You are right. One’s\r\nnative land!--there should one live! there die! And I die far from all I\r\nloved!”\r\n\r\n“You have some last wish to transmit,” said the engineer with emotion,\r\n“some souvenir to send to those friends you have left in the mountains\r\nof India?”\r\n\r\n“No, Captain Harding; no friends remain to me! I am the last of my race,\r\nand to all whom I have known I have long been as are the dead.--But\r\nto return to yourselves. Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and\r\nbeyond human endurance. I die of having thought it possible to live\r\nalone! You should, therefore, dare all in the attempt to leave Lincoln\r\nIsland, and see once more the land of your birth. I am aware that those\r\nwretches have destroyed the vessel you have built.”\r\n\r\n“We propose to construct a vessel,” said Gideon Spilett, “sufficiently\r\nlarge to convey us to the nearest land; but if we should succeed, sooner\r\nor later we shall return to Lincoln Island. We are attached to it by too\r\nmany recollections ever to forget it.”\r\n\r\n“It is here that we have known Captain Nemo,” said Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“It is here only that we can make our home!” added Herbert.\r\n\r\n“And here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity, if--” replied the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, and, instead of completing the sentence, said\r\nsimply,--\r\n\r\n“Mr. Harding, I wish to speak with you--alone!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s companions, respecting the wish, retired.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain Nemo, and\r\nsoon recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them of the private\r\nmatters which the dying man had confided to him.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was evident\r\nthat he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which had lost the\r\npower of reaction against his physical weakness.\r\n\r\nThe day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the “Nautilus”\r\n for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible to distinguish\r\nit from day in the cavern.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His noble\r\nfeatures, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly calm. Inaudible\r\nwords escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing upon various incidents\r\nof his checkered career. Life was evidently ebbing slowly and his\r\nextremities were already cold.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him, and\r\nsmiled on them with that last smile which continues after death.\r\n\r\nAt length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme effort\r\nsucceeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if wishing in that\r\nattitude to compose himself for death.\r\n\r\nBy one o’clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying light\r\ngleamed in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the words, “God\r\nand my country!” he quietly expired.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the\r\nPrince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\nHerbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton’s eyes. Neb\r\nwas on his knees by the reporter’s side, motionless as a statue.\r\n\r\nThen Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the dead,\r\nsaid solemnly, “May his soul be with God!” Turning to his friends, he\r\nadded, “Let us pray for him whom we have lost!”\r\n\r\n\r\nSome hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain\r\nby carrying out his dying wishes.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions quitted the “Nautilus,” taking with\r\nthem the only memento left them by their benefactor, the coffer which\r\ncontained wealth amounting to millions.\r\n\r\nThe marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully\r\nclosed. The iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in\r\nsuch a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from penetrating to the\r\ninterior of the “Nautilus.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to the\r\nside of the submarine vessel.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the water-line,\r\nwere two large stop-cocks communicating with the reservoirs employed in\r\nthe submersion of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the “Nautilus,”\r\n slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the lake.\r\n\r\nBut the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves.\r\nThe powerful light it gave forth lighted up the translucent water, while\r\nthe cavern became gradually obscure. At length this vast effusion of\r\nelectric light faded away, and soon after the “Nautilus,” now the tomb\r\nof Captain Nemo, reposed in its ocean bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\n\r\nAt break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the\r\ncavern, to which they gave the name of “Dakkar Grotto,” in memory of\r\nCaptain Nemo. It was now low-water, and they passed without difficulty\r\nunder the arcade, washed on the right by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As\r\nadditional precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a little\r\nbeach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a spot where it\r\ncould run no risk of harm.\r\n\r\nThe storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings of the\r\nthunder died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the sky was yet\r\nobscured by clouds. On the whole, this month of October, the first of\r\nthe southern spring, was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens, and the\r\nwind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another,\r\nwhich rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had taken\r\nthe road to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were careful to\r\npreserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the\r\ncorral and the grotto, and which might at a future time be of service.\r\n\r\nThe colonists spoke but little on the road. The various incidents of the\r\nnight of October 15th had left a profound impression on their minds. The\r\nunknown being whose influence had so effectually protected them, the\r\nman whom their imagination had endowed with supernatural powers, Captain\r\nNemo, was no more. His “Nautilus” and he were buried in the depths of\r\nthe abyss. To each one of them their existence seemed even more isolated\r\nthan before. They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of\r\nthat power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus\r\nHarding, could not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a\r\nprofound silence during their journey to the corral.\r\n\r\nTowards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite House.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be\r\nactively pushed forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted his\r\ntime and labor to this object. It was impossible to divine what future\r\nlay before them. Evidently the advantage to the colonists would be great\r\nof having at their disposal a substantial vessel, capable of keeping the\r\nsea even in heavy weather, and large enough to attempt, in case of\r\nneed, a voyage of some duration. Even if, when their vessel should be\r\ncompleted, the colonists should not resolve to leave Lincoln Island as\r\nyet, in order to gain either one of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the\r\nPacific or the shores of New Zealand, they might at least, sooner or\r\nlater, proceed to Tabor Island, to leave there the notice relating to\r\nAyrton. This was a precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility\r\nof the Scotch yacht reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest\r\nimportance that nothing should be neglected on this point.\r\n\r\nThe works were then resumed. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Ayrton,\r\nassisted by Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when unavoidably\r\ncalled off by other necessary occupations, worked without cessation. It\r\nwas important that the new vessel should be ready in five months--that\r\nis to say, by the beginning of March--if they wished to visit Tabor\r\nIsland before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage impracticable.\r\nTherefore the carpenters lost not a moment. Moreover, it was unnecessary\r\nto manufacture rigging, that of the “Speedy” having been saved entire,\r\nso that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed.\r\n\r\nThe end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important labors,\r\nto the exclusion of almost all others. At the expiration of two months\r\nand a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted. It\r\nwas already evident that the plans made by Cyrus Harding were admirable,\r\nand that the vessel would behave well at sea.\r\n\r\nPencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even grumble\r\nwhen one or the other abandoned the carpenter’s axe for the gun of the\r\nhunter. It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite\r\nHouse, in view of the approaching winter. But this did not satisfy\r\nPencroft. The brave, honest sailor was not content when the workmen were\r\nnot at the dockyard. When this happened he grumbled vigorously, and, by\r\nway of venting his feelings, did the work of six men.\r\n\r\nThe weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season.\r\nFor some days the heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, saturated\r\nwith electricity, was only cleared by violent storms. It was rarely that\r\nthe distant growling of the thunder could not be heard, like a low but\r\nincessant murmur, such as is produced in the equatorial regions of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme violence,\r\nand the thunder burst several times over the island. Large trees were\r\nstruck by the electric fluid and shattered, and among others one of\r\nthose gigantic nettle-trees which had shaded the poultry-yard at the\r\nsouthern extremity of the lake. Had this meteor any relation to the\r\nphenomena going on in the bowels of the earth? Was there any connection\r\nbetween the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the\r\nearth? Cyrus Harding was inclined to think that such was the case, for\r\nthe development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at daybreak\r\nto the plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the onagers,\r\nperceived an enormous hat-shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nHerbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined him in\r\nwatching the summit of Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Pencroft, “those are not vapors this time! It seems to\r\nme that the giant is not content with breathing; he must smoke!”\r\n\r\nThis figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed the\r\nchanges going on at the mouth of the volcano. Already for three months\r\nhad the crater emitted vapors more or less dense, but which were as yet\r\nproduced only by an internal ebullition of mineral substances. But\r\nnow the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke, rising in the form of a\r\ngrayish column, more than three hundred feet in width at its base, and\r\nwhich spread like an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight\r\nhundred feet above the summit of the mountain.\r\n\r\n“The fire is in the chimney,” observed Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“And we can’t put it out!” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“The volcano ought to be swept,” observed Neb, who spoke as if perfectly\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n“Well said, Neb!” cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; “and you’ll\r\nundertake the job, no doubt?”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount\r\nFranklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant\r\nmuttering. Then, turning towards his companions, from whom he had gone\r\nsomewhat apart, he said,--\r\n\r\n“The truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves that an\r\nimportant change is going forward. The volcanic substances are no longer\r\nin a state of ebullition, they have caught fire, and we are undoubtedly\r\nmenaced by an approaching eruption.”\r\n\r\n“Well, captain,” said Pencroft, “we shall witness the eruption; and if\r\nit is a good one, we’ll applaud it. I don’t see that we need concern\r\nourselves further about the matter.”\r\n\r\n“It may be so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “for the ancient track of\r\nthe lava is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto\r\noverflowed towards the north. And yet--”\r\n\r\n“And yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it might be\r\nbetter it should not take place,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” answered the sailor. “Perhaps there may be some valuable\r\nsubstance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and which we may\r\nturn to good account!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good\r\nfrom the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden. He did not\r\nregard so lightly as Pencroft the results of an eruption. If the lava,\r\nin consequence of the position of the crater, did not directly menace\r\nthe wooded and cultivated parts of the island, other complications might\r\npresent themselves. In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied\r\nby earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed of\r\nsubstances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on\r\nthe north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could\r\nnot be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk\r\nof disintegration. Although, therefore, the spreading of the volcanic\r\nmatter might not constitute a serious danger, any movement of the\r\nterrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail the\r\ngravest consequences.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place his ear\r\nto the ground, “it seems to me that I can hear a dull, rumbling sound,\r\nlike that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were convinced\r\nthat Ayrton was not mistaken. The rumbling was mingled with a\r\nsubterranean roar, which formed a sort of rinforzando, and died slowly\r\naway, as if some violent storm had passed through the profundities of\r\nthe globe. But no explosion properly so termed, could be heard. It might\r\ntherefore be concluded that the vapors and smoke found a free passage\r\nthrough the central shaft; and that the safety-valve being sufficiently\r\nlarge, no convulsion would be produced, no explosion was to be\r\napprehended.\r\n\r\n“Well, then!” said Pencroft, “are we not going back to work? Let Mount\r\nFranklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame as much as\r\nit pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle! Come, Ayrton, Neb,\r\nHerbert, Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one of us must turn to at\r\nour work to-day! We are going to place the keelson, and a dozen pair\r\nof hands would not be too many. Before two months I want our new\r\n‘Bonadventure’--for we shall keep the old name, shall we not?--to float\r\non the waters of Port Balloon! Therefore there is not an hour to lose!”\r\n\r\nAll the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by Pencroft,\r\ndescended to the dockyard, and proceeded to place the keelson, a thick\r\nmass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly\r\nthe timbers of the hull. It was an arduous undertaking, in which all\r\ntook part.\r\n\r\nThey continued their labors during the whole of this day, the 3rd of\r\nJanuary, without thinking further of the volcano, which could not,\r\nbesides, be seen from the shore of Granite House. But once or twice,\r\nlarge shadows, veiling the sun, which described its diurnal arc through\r\nan extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick cloud of smoke passed\r\nbetween its disc and the island. The wind, blowing on the shore, carried\r\nall these vapors to the westward. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett\r\nremarked these somber appearances, and from time to time discussed\r\nthe evident progress of the volcanic phenomena, but their work went\r\non without interruption. It was, besides, of the first importance from\r\nevery point of view, that the vessel should be finished with the least\r\npossible delay. In presence of the eventualities which might arise,\r\nthe safety of the colonists would be to a great extent secured by their\r\nship. Who could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge?\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert\r\nagain ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. It was already dark, and\r\nthe obscurity would permit them to ascertain if flames or incandescent\r\nmatter thrown up by the volcano were mingled with the vapor and smoke\r\naccumulated at the mouth of the crater.\r\n\r\n“The crater is on fire!” said Herbert, who, more active than his\r\ncompanion, first reached the plateau.\r\n\r\nMount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a gigantic\r\ntorch, around the summit of which turned fuliginous flames. So much\r\nsmoke, and possibly scoriae and cinders were mingled with them, that\r\ntheir light gleamed but faintly amid the gloom of the night. But a kind\r\nof lurid brilliancy spread over the island, against which stood out\r\nconfusedly the wooded masses of the heights. Immense whirlwinds of vapor\r\nobscured the sky, through which glimmered a few stars.\r\n\r\n“The change is rapid!” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“That is not surprising,” answered the reporter. “The reawakening of the\r\nvolcano already dates back some time. You may remember, Cyrus, that\r\nthe first vapors appeared about the time we searched the sides of the\r\nmountain to discover Captain Nemo’s retreat. It was, if I mistake not,\r\nabout the 15th of October.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Herbert, “two months and a half ago!”\r\n\r\n“The subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten weeks,”\r\n resumed Gideon Spilett, “and it is not to be wondered at that they now\r\nbreak out with such violence!”\r\n\r\n“Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?” asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but there is a great difference between\r\nthat and an earthquake.”\r\n\r\n“I do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,” answered Cyrus\r\nHarding, “may God preserve us from that! No; these vibrations are due to\r\nthe effervescence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is\r\nsimply the shell of a boiler, and you know that such a shell, under the\r\npressure of steam, vibrates like a sonorous plate. It is this effect\r\nwhich is being produced at this moment.”\r\n\r\n“What magnificent flames!” exclaimed Herbert.\r\n\r\nAt this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater,\r\nthe brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors. Thousands\r\nof luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various\r\ndirections. Some, extending beyond the dome of smoke, dissipated\r\nit, leaving behind an incandescent powder. This was accompanied\r\nby successive explosions, resembling the discharge of a battery of\r\nmachine-guns.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour on the\r\nplateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach, and returned\r\nto Granite House. The engineer was thoughtful and preoccupied, so much\r\nso, indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he apprehended any immediate\r\ndanger, of which the eruption might directly or indirectly be the cause.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and no,” answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” continued the reporter, “would not the greatest\r\nmisfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would\r\noverturn the island? Now, I do not suppose that this is to be feared,\r\nsince the vapors and lava have found a free outlet.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and I do not fear an earthquake in the\r\nsense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil\r\nprovoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But other causes may\r\nproduce great disasters.”\r\n\r\n“How so, my dear Cyrus?’\r\n\r\n“I am not certain. I must consider. I must visit the mountain. In a few\r\ndays I shall learn more on this point.”\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the explosions of\r\nthe volcano, whose intensity increased, and which were repeated by the\r\nechoes of the island, the inhabitants of Granite House were sleeping\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nThree days passed by--the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January. The construction\r\nof the vessel was diligently continued, and without offering further\r\nexplanations the engineer pushed forward the work with all his energy.\r\nMount Franklin was now hooded by a somber cloud of sinister aspect, and,\r\namid the flames, vomiting forth incandescent rocks, some of which fell\r\nback into the crater itself. This caused Pencroft, who would only look\r\nat the matter in the light of a joke, to exclaim,--\r\n\r\n“Ah! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a conjurer.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss, and\r\nit did not seem that the lava, though swollen by the internal pressure,\r\nhad yet risen to the orifice of the crater. At any rate, the opening on\r\nthe northeast, which was partly visible, poured out no torrent upon the\r\nnorthern slope of the mountain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the vessel, other\r\nduties demanded the presence of the colonists on various portions of the\r\nisland. Before everything it was necessary to go to the corral, where\r\nthe flocks of musmons and goats were enclosed, and replenish the\r\nprovision of forage for those animals. It was accordingly arranged that\r\nAyrton should proceed thither the next day, the 7th of January; and as\r\nhe was sufficient for the task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft and\r\nthe rest were somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton--\r\n\r\n“As you are going to-morrow to the corral I will accompany you.”\r\n\r\n“But, Captain Harding,” exclaimed the sailor, “our working days will not\r\nbe many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands short!”\r\n\r\n“We shall return to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding, “but it is necessary\r\nthat I should go to the corral. I must learn how the eruption is\r\nprogressing.”\r\n\r\n“The eruption! always the eruption!” answered Pencroft, with an air of\r\ndiscontent. “An important thing, truly, this eruption! I trouble myself\r\nvery little about it.”\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the sailor’s opinion, the expedition projected by the\r\nengineer was settled for the next day. Herbert wished to accompany Cyrus\r\nHarding, but he would not vex Pencroft by his absence.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the cart drawn\r\nby two onagers, took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot.\r\n\r\nAbove the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater of Mount\r\nFranklin incessantly added fuliginous matter. These clouds, which rolled\r\nheavily in the air, were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances.\r\nIt was not alone from the volcano that they derived their strange\r\nopacity and weight. Scoriae, in a state of dust, like powdered\r\npumice-stone, and grayish ashes as small as the finest feculae, were\r\nheld in suspension in the midst of their thick folds. These ashes are so\r\nfine that they have been observed in the air for whole months. After\r\nthe eruption of 1783 in Iceland for upwards of a year the atmosphere was\r\nthus charged with volcanic dust through which the rays of the sun were\r\nonly with difficulty discernible.\r\n\r\nBut more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened on the\r\npresent occasion. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely reached the\r\ncorral when a sort of black snow like fine gunpowder fell, and instantly\r\nchanged the appearance of the soil. Trees, meadows, all disappeared\r\nbeneath a covering several inches in depth. But, very fortunately,\r\nthe wind blew from the northeast, and the greater part of the cloud\r\ndissolved itself over the sea.\r\n\r\n“This is very singular, Captain Harding,” said Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“It is very serious,” replied the engineer. “This powdered pumice-stone,\r\nall this mineral dust, proves how grave is the convulsion going forward\r\nin the lower depths of the volcano.”\r\n\r\n“But can nothing be done?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon. Do you,\r\ntherefore, Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the\r\ncorral. In the meantime I will ascend just beyond the source of Red\r\nCreek and examine the condition of the mountain upon its northern\r\naspect. Then--”\r\n\r\n“Well, Captain Harding?”\r\n\r\n“Then we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto. I wish to inspect it. At any\r\nrate I will come back for you in two hours.”\r\n\r\nAyrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting the\r\nengineer’s return, busied himself with the musmons and goats which\r\nseemed to feel a certain uneasiness in presence of these first signs of\r\nan eruption.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur, passed\r\nRed Creek, and arrived at the spot where he and his companions had\r\ndiscovered a sulphurous spring at the time of their first exploration.\r\n\r\nHow changed was everything! Instead of a single column of smoke he\r\ncounted thirteen, forced through the soil as if violently propelled by\r\nsome piston. It was evident that the crust of the earth was subjected\r\nin this part of the globe to a frightful pressure. The atmosphere was\r\nsaturated with gases and carbonic acid, mingled with aqueous vapors.\r\nCyrus Harding felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn,\r\nand which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time,\r\ntremble beneath him, but he could discover no traces of fresh lava.\r\n\r\nThe engineer became more assured of this when he observed all the\r\nnorthern part of Mount Franklin. Pillars of smoke and flame escaped from\r\nthe crater; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground; but no current of\r\nlava burst from the mouth of the volcano, which proved that the volcanic\r\nmatter had not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the\r\ncentral shaft.\r\n\r\n“But I would prefer that it were so,” said Cyrus Harding to himself. “At\r\nany rate, I should then know that the lava had followed its accustomed\r\ntrack. Who can say that it may not take a new course? But the danger\r\ndoes not consist in that! Captain Nemo foresaw it clearly! No, the\r\ndanger does not lie there!”\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose prolongation\r\nenclosed the narrow Shark Gulf. He could now sufficiently examine on\r\nthis side the ancient channels of the lava. There was no doubt in his\r\nmind that the most recent eruption had occurred at a far-distant epoch.\r\n\r\nHe then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the\r\nsubterranean mutterings which rolled like long-continued thunder,\r\ninterrupted by deafening explosions. At nine in the morning he reached\r\nthe corral.\r\n\r\nAyrton awaited him.\r\n\r\n“The animals are cared for, Captain Harding,” said Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“Good, Ayrton.”\r\n\r\n“They seem uneasy, Captain Harding.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never deceived.”\r\n\r\n“Are you ready?”\r\n\r\n“Take a lamp, Ayrton,” answered the engineer; “we will start at once.”\r\n\r\nAyrton did as desired. The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the corral.\r\nThe gate was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding, preceding\r\nAyrton, took the narrow path which led westward to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter fallen\r\nfrom the cloud. No quadruped appeared in the woods. Even the birds had\r\nfled. Sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of ashes, and the\r\ntwo colonists, enveloped in a whirlwind of dust, lost sight of each\r\nother. They were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with\r\nhandkerchiefs, for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these impediments,\r\nto make rapid progress. Moreover, the atmosphere was close, as if the\r\noxygen had been partly burned up, and had become unfit for respiration.\r\nAt every hundred paces they were obliged to stop to take breath. It was\r\ntherefore past ten o’clock when the engineer and his companion reached\r\nthe crest of the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which\r\ncomposed the northwest coast of the island.\r\n\r\nAyrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity,\r\nfollowing almost step for step the difficult path which, during that\r\nstormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto. In open day the descent was\r\nless perilous, and, besides, the bed of ashes which covered the polished\r\nsurface of the rock enabled them to make their footing more secure.\r\n\r\nThe ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height, was soon\r\nreached. Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation gradually sloped\r\ntowards the level of the sea. Although the tide was at present low, no\r\nbeach could be seen, and the waves, thickened by the volcanic dust, beat\r\nupon the basaltic rocks.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance to Dakkar\r\nGrotto, and paused for a moment at the last rock before it.\r\n\r\n“The iron boat should be there,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“It is here, Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, drawing towards him the\r\nfragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the vault.\r\n\r\n“On board, Ayrton!”\r\n\r\nThe two colonists stepped into the boat. A slight undulation of the\r\nwaves carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and there\r\nAyrton, with the aid of flint and steel, lighted the lamp. He then took\r\nthe oars, and the lamp having been placed in the bow of the boat, so\r\nthat its rays fell before them, Cyrus Harding took the helm and steered\r\nthrough the shades of the grotto.\r\n\r\nThe “Nautilus” was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its\r\nelectric light. Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but no ray\r\nescaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was\r\nmortal of Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\nThe light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless enabled\r\nthe engineer to advance slowly, following the wall of the cavern. A\r\ndeathlike silence reigned under the vaulted roof, or at least in the\r\nanterior portion, for soon Cyrus Harding distinctly heard the rumbling\r\nwhich proceeded from the bowels of the mountain.\r\n\r\n“That comes from the volcano,” he said.\r\n\r\nBesides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon\r\nbetrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were\r\nalmost suffocated by sulphurous vapors.\r\n\r\n“This is what Captain Nemo feared,” murmured Cyrus Harding, changing\r\ncountenance. “We must go to the end, notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\n“Forward!” replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the boat\r\ntowards the head of the cavern.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the boat\r\nreached the extreme end.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon the\r\nwalls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the\r\nvolcano. What was the thickness of this wall? It might be ten feet or a\r\nhundred feet--it was impossible to say. But the subterranean sounds were\r\ntoo perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, after having explored the wall at a certain height\r\nhorizontally, fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again surveyed\r\nthe basaltic wall at a greater elevation.\r\n\r\nThere, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a pungent\r\nvapor, which infected the atmosphere of the cavern. The wall was broken\r\nby large cracks, some of which extended to within two or three feet of\r\nthe water’s edge.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding thought for a brief space. Then he said in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n“Yes! the captain was right! The danger lies there, and a terrible\r\ndanger!”\r\n\r\nAyrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding, resumed the\r\noars, and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of\r\nDakkar Grotto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 8th day of January, after a day and night passed\r\nat the corral, where they left all in order, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton\r\narrived at Granite House.\r\n\r\nThe engineer immediately called his companions together, and informed\r\nthem of the imminent danger which threatened Lincoln Island, and from\r\nwhich no human power could deliver them.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” he said, and his voice betrayed the depth of his emotion,\r\n“our island is not among those which will endure while this earth\r\nendures. It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction, the cause of\r\nwhich it bears within itself, and from which nothing can save it.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists looked at each other, then at the engineer. They did not\r\nclearly comprehend him.\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself, Cyrus!” said Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“I will do so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “or rather I will simply\r\nafford you the explanation which, during our few minutes of private\r\nconversation, was given me by Captain Nemo.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Nemo!” exclaimed the colonists.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before his\r\ndeath!”\r\n\r\n“The last service!” exclaimed Pencroft, “the last service! You will see\r\nthat though he is dead he will render us others yet!”\r\n\r\n“But what did the captain say?” inquired the reporter.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you, my friends,” said the engineer. “Lincoln Island does\r\nnot resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a fact of which\r\nCaptain Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or later bring about the\r\nsubversion of its foundation.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Lincoln Island, it can’t be!” cried Pencroft, who, in spite\r\nof the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a gesture of\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Pencroft,” resumed the engineer, “I will tell you what Captain\r\nNemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed yesterday, during\r\nthe exploration of Dakkar Grotto.\r\n\r\n“This cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano, and is\r\nonly separated from its central shaft by the wall which terminates it.\r\nNow, this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow\r\nthe sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to\r\nescape.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal pressure\r\nfrom within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving way and that\r\nafter a longer or shorter period it will afford a passage to the waters\r\nof the lake which fill the cavern.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. “The sea will\r\nextinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the matter!”\r\n\r\n“Not so!” said Cyrus Harding, “should a day arrive when the sea, rushing\r\nthrough the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central shaft into the\r\ninterior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln Island will that day\r\nbe blown into the air--just as would happen to the island of Sicily were\r\nthe Mediterranean to precipitate itself into Mount Etna.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists made no answer to these significant words of the engineer.\r\nThey now understood the danger by which they were menaced.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that Cyrus Harding had in no way exaggerated the danger\r\nto be apprehended. Many persons have formed an idea that it would be\r\npossible to extinguish volcanoes, which are almost always situated on\r\nthe shores of a sea or lake, by opening a passage for the admission of\r\nthe water. But they are not aware that this would be to incur the risk\r\nof blowing up a portion of the globe, like a boiler whose steam is\r\nsuddenly expanded by intense heat. The water, rushing into a cavity\r\nwhose temperature might be estimated at thousands of degrees, would\r\nbe converted into steam with a sudden energy which no enclosure could\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nIt was not therefore doubtful that the island, menaced by a frightful\r\nand approaching convulsion, would endure only so long as the wall\r\nof Dakkar Grotto itself should endure. It was not even a question of\r\nmonths, nor of weeks, but of days; it might be of hours.\r\n\r\nThe first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound\r\nsorrow. They thought not so much of the peril which menaced themselves\r\npersonally, but of the destruction of the island which had sheltered\r\nthem, which they had cultivated, which they loved so well, and had hoped\r\nto render so flourishing. So much effort ineffectually expended, so much\r\nlabor lost.\r\n\r\nPencroft could not prevent a large tear from rolling down his cheek, nor\r\ndid he attempt to conceal it.\r\n\r\nSome further conversation now took place. The chances yet in favor of\r\nthe colonists were discussed; but finally it was agreed that there was\r\nnot an hour to be lost, that the building and fitting of the vessel\r\nshould be pushed forward with their utmost energy, and that this was the\r\nsole chance of safety for the inhabitants of Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nAll hands, therefore, set to work on the vessel. What could it avail\r\nto sow, to reap, to hunt, to increase the stores of Granite House?\r\nThe contents of the storehouse and outbuildings contained more than\r\nsufficient to provide the ship for a voyage, however long might be its\r\nduration. But it was imperative that the ship should be ready to receive\r\nthem before the inevitable catastrophe should arrive.\r\n\r\nTheir labors were now carried on with feverish ardor. By the 23rd of\r\nJanuary the vessel was half-decked over. Up to this time no change had\r\ntaken place on the summit of the volcano. Vapor and smoke mingled with\r\nflames and incandescent stones were thrown up from the crater. But\r\nduring the night of the 23rd, in consequence of the lava attaining the\r\nlevel of the first stratum of the volcano, the hat-shaped cone which\r\nformed over the latter disappeared. A frightful sound was heard. The\r\ncolonists at first thought the island was rent asunder, and rushed out\r\nof Granite House.\r\n\r\nThis occurred about two o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe sky appeared on fire. The superior cone, a mass of rock a thousand\r\nfeet in height, and weighing thousands of millions of pounds, had\r\nbeen thrown down upon the island, making it tremble to its foundation.\r\nFortunately, this cone inclined to the north, and had fallen upon the\r\nplain of sand and tufa stretching between the volcano and the sea. The\r\naperture of the crater being thus enlarged projected towards the sky a\r\nglare so intense that by the simple effect of reflection the atmosphere\r\nappeared red-hot. At the same time a torrent of lava, bursting from the\r\nnew summit, poured out in long cascades, like water escaping from a vase\r\ntoo full, and a thousand tongues of fire crept over the sides of the\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\n“The corral! the corral!” exclaimed Ayrton.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, towards the corral that the lava was rushing as the\r\nnew crater faced the east, and consequently the fertile portions of the\r\nisland, the springs of Red Creek and Jacamar Wood, were menaced with\r\ninstant destruction.\r\n\r\nAt Ayrton’s cry the colonists rushed to the onagers’ stables. The cart\r\nwas at once harnessed. All were possessed by the same thought--to hasten\r\nto the corral and set at liberty the animals it enclosed.\r\n\r\nBefore three in the morning they arrived at the corral. The cries of the\r\nterrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them.\r\nAlready a torrent of burning matter and liquefied minerals fell from\r\nthe side of the mountain upon the meadows as far as the side of the\r\npalisade. The gate was burst open by Ayrton, and the animals, bewildered\r\nwith terror, fled in all directions.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral, converting into\r\nvapor the water of the little rivulet which ran through it, burning up\r\nthe house like dry grass, and leaving not even a post of the palisade to\r\nmark the spot where the corral once stood.\r\n\r\nTo contend against this disaster would have been folly--nay, madness. In\r\npresence of Nature’s grand convulsions man is powerless.\r\n\r\nIt was now daylight--the 24th of January. Cyrus Harding and his\r\ncompanions, before returning to Granite House, desired to ascertain the\r\nprobable direction this inundation of lava was about to take. The soil\r\nsloped gradually from Mount Franklin to the east coast, and it was to be\r\nfeared that, in spite of the thick Jacamar Wood, the torrent would reach\r\nthe plateau of Prospect Heights.\r\n\r\n“The lake will cover us,” said Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“I hope so!” was Cyrus Harding’s only reply.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the\r\nsuperior cone of Mount Franklin had fallen, but the lava arrested their\r\nprogress. It had followed, on one side, the valley of Red Creek, and\r\non the other that of Falls River, evaporating those watercourses in its\r\npassage. There was no possibility of crossing the torrent of lava;\r\non the contrary, the colonists were obliged to retreat before it. The\r\nvolcano, without its crown, was no longer recognizable, terminated as it\r\nwas by a sort of flat table which replaced the ancient crater. From two\r\nopenings in its southern and eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava\r\npoured forth, thus forming two distinct streams. Above the new crater a\r\ncloud of smoke and ashes, mingled with those of the atmosphere, massed\r\nover the island. Loud peals of thunder broke, and could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished from the rumblings of the mountain, whose mouth vomited\r\nforth ignited rocks, which, hurled to more than a thousand feet, burst\r\nin the air like shells. Flashes of lightning rivaled in intensity the\r\nvolcano’s eruption.\r\n\r\nTowards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable by the\r\ncolonists, who accordingly took shelter in the borders of Jacamar Wood.\r\nNot only did the projectiles begin to rain around them, but the lava,\r\noverflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to cut off the road to the\r\ncorral. The nearest rows of trees caught fire, and their sap, suddenly\r\ntransformed into vapor, caused them to explode with loud reports, while\r\nothers, less moist, remained unhurt in the midst of the inundation.\r\n\r\nThe colonists had again taken the road to the corral. They proceeded but\r\nslowly, frequently looking back; but, in consequence of the inclination\r\nof the soil, the lava gained rapidly in the east, and as its lower waves\r\nbecame solidified others, at boiling heat, covered them immediately.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more and\r\nmore menacing. All this portion of the forest was on fire, and enormous\r\nwreaths of smoke rolled over the trees, whose trunks were already\r\nconsumed by the lava.\r\n\r\nThe colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the mouth of\r\nRed Creek. A question of life or death was now to be decided.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important crises, and\r\naware that he was addressing men capable of hearing the truth, whatever\r\nit might be, then said,--\r\n\r\n“Either the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a part of\r\nthe island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the stream will\r\noverrun the forests of the Far West, and not a tree or plant will\r\nremain on the surface of the soil. We shall have no prospect but that\r\nof starvation upon these barren rocks--a death which will probably be\r\nanticipated by the explosion of the island.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping his\r\nfoot, “what’s the use of working any longer on the vessel?”\r\n\r\n“Pencroft,” answered Cyrus Harding, “we must do our duty to the last!”\r\n\r\nAt this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage through\r\nthe noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the borders of the\r\nlake. At this point there was an elevation of the soil which, had it\r\nbeen greater, might have sufficed to arrest the torrent.\r\n\r\n“To work!” cried Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s thought was at once understood. It might be possible to\r\ndam, as it were, the torrent, and thus compel it to pour itself into the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nThe colonists hastened to the dockyard. They returned with shovels,\r\npicks, axes, and by means of banking the earth with the aid of fallen\r\ntrees they succeeded in a few hours in raising an embankment three feet\r\nhigh and some hundreds of paces in length. It seemed to them, when\r\nthey had finished, as if they had scarcely been working more than a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nIt was not a moment too soon. The liquefied substances soon after\r\nreached the bottom of the barrier. The stream of lava swelled like a\r\nriver about to overflow its banks, and threatened to demolish the sole\r\nobstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole Far West. But\r\nthe dam held firm, and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent\r\nprecipitated itself into Grant Lake from a height of twenty feet.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, without moving or uttering a word, breathlessly regarded\r\nthis strife of the two elements.\r\n\r\nWhat a spectacle was this conflict between water and fire! What pen\r\ncould describe the marvelous horror of this scene--what pencil could\r\ndepict it? The water hissed as it evaporated by contact with the boiling\r\nlava. The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable height, as if\r\nthe valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened. But, however\r\nconsiderable might be the volume of water contained in the lake, it must\r\neventually be absorbed, because it was not replenished, while the stream\r\nof lava, fed from an inexhaustible source, rolled on without ceasing new\r\nwaves of incandescent matter.\r\n\r\nThe first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately solidified\r\nand accumulated so as speedily to emerge from it. Upon their surface\r\nfell other waves, which in their turn became stone, but a step\r\nnearer the center of the lake. In this manner was formed a pier which\r\nthreatened to gradually fill up the lake, which could not overflow, the\r\nwater displaced by the lava being evaporated. The hissing of the water\r\nrent the air with a deafening sound, and the vapor, blown by the wind,\r\nfell in rain upon the sea. The pier became longer and longer, and the\r\nblocks of lava piled themselves one on another. Where formerly stretched\r\nthe calm waters of the lake now appeared an enormous mass of smoking\r\nrocks, as if an upheaving of the soil had formed immense shoals. Imagine\r\nthe waters of the lake aroused by a hurricane, then suddenly solidified\r\nby an intense frost, and some conception may be formed of the aspect of\r\nthe lake three hours after the eruption of this irresistible torrent of\r\nlava.\r\n\r\nThis time water would be vanquished by fire.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the\r\neffusion of lava should have been in the direction of Lake Grant. They\r\nhad before them some days’ respite. The plateau of Prospect Heights,\r\nGranite House, and the dockyard were for the moment preserved. And these\r\nfew days it was necessary to employ in planking and carefully calking\r\nthe vessel, and launching her. The colonists would then take refuge on\r\nboard the vessel, content to rig her after she should be afloat on the\r\nwaters. With the danger of an explosion which threatened to destroy the\r\nisland there could be no security on shore. The walls of Granite House,\r\nonce so sure a retreat, might at any moment fall in upon them.\r\n\r\nDuring the six following days, from the 25th to the 30th of January, the\r\ncolonists accomplished as much of the construction of their vessel as\r\ntwenty men could have done. They hardly allowed themselves a moment’s\r\nrepose, and the glare of the flames which shot from the crater enabled\r\nthem to work night and day. The flow of lava continued, but perhaps\r\nless abundantly. This was fortunate, for Lake Grant was almost entirely\r\nchoked up, and if more lava should accumulate it would inevitably spread\r\nover the plateau of Prospect Heights, and thence upon the beach.\r\n\r\nBut if the island was thus partially protected on this side, it was not\r\nso with the western part.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the second stream of lava, which had followed the valley of\r\nFalls River, a valley of great extent, the land on both sides of the\r\ncreek being flat, met with no obstacle. The burning liquid had then\r\nspread through the forest of the Far West. At this period of the year,\r\nwhen the trees were dried up by a tropical heat, the forest caught fire\r\ninstantaneously, in such a manner that the conflagration extended itself\r\nboth by the trunks of the trees and by their higher branches, whose\r\ninterlacement favored its progress. It even appeared that the current\r\nof flame spread more rapidly among the summits of the trees than the\r\ncurrent of lava at their bases.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the wild animals, jaguars, wild boars, capybaras,\r\nkoalas, and game of every kind, mad with terror, had fled to the banks\r\nof the Mercy and to the Tadorn Marsh, beyond the road to Port Balloon.\r\nBut the colonists were too much occupied with their task to pay any\r\nattention to even the most formidable of these animals. They had\r\nabandoned Granite House, and would not even take shelter at the\r\nChimneys, but encamped under a tent, near the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nEach day Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ascended the plateau of\r\nProspect Heights. Sometimes Herbert accompanied them, but never\r\nPencroft, who could not bear to look upon the prospect of the island now\r\nso utterly devastated.\r\n\r\nIt was, in truth, a heart-rending spectacle. All the wooded part of the\r\nisland was now completely bare. One single clump of green trees raised\r\ntheir heads at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula. Here and there\r\nwere a few grotesque blackened and branchless stumps. The side of the\r\ndevastated forest was even more barren than Tadorn Marsh. The eruption\r\nof lava had been complete. Where formerly sprang up that charming\r\nverdure, the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of volcanic tufa.\r\nIn the valleys of the Falls and Mercy rivers no drop of water now\r\nflowed towards the sea, and should Lake Grant be entirely dried up,\r\nthe colonists would have no means of quenching their thirst. But,\r\nfortunately the lava had spared the southern corner of the lake,\r\ncontaining all that remained of the drinking water of the island.\r\nTowards the northwest stood out the rugged and well-defined outlines of\r\nthe sides of the volcano, like a gigantic claw hovering over the island.\r\nWhat a sad and fearful sight, and how painful to the colonists, who,\r\nfrom a fertile domain covered with forests, irrigated by watercourses,\r\nand enriched by the produce of their toils, found themselves, as it\r\nwere, transported to a desolate rock, upon which, but for their reserves\r\nof provisions, they could not even gather the means of subsistence!\r\n\r\n“It is enough to break one’s heart!” said Gideon Spilett, one day.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Spilett,” answered the engineer. “May God grant us the time to\r\ncomplete this vessel, now our sole refuge!”\r\n\r\n“Do not you think, Cyrus, that the violence of the eruption has somewhat\r\nlessened? The volcano still vomits forth lava, but somewhat less\r\nabundantly, if I mistake not.”\r\n\r\n“It matters little,” answered Cyrus Harding. “The fire is still burning\r\nin the interior of the mountain, and the sea may break in at any moment.\r\nWe are in the condition of passengers whose ship is devoured by a\r\nconflagration which they cannot extinguish, and who know that sooner or\r\nlater the flames must reach the powder-magazine. To work, Spilett, to\r\nwork, and let us not lose an hour!”\r\n\r\nDuring eight days more, that is to say until the 7th of February,\r\nthe lava continued to flow, but the eruption was confined within the\r\nprevious limits. Cyrus Harding feared above all lest the liquefied\r\nmatter should overflow the shore, for in that event the dockyard could\r\nnot escape. Moreover, about this time the colonists felt in the frame of\r\nthe island vibrations which alarmed them to the highest degree.\r\n\r\nIt was the 20th of February. Yet another month must elapse before the\r\nvessel would be ready for sea. Would the island hold together till then?\r\nThe intention of Pencroft and Cyrus Harding was to launch the vessel\r\nas soon as the hull should be complete. The deck, the upperworks, the\r\ninterior woodwork and the rigging might be finished afterwards, but the\r\nessential point was that the colonists should have an assured refuge\r\naway from the island. Perhaps it might be even better to conduct the\r\nvessel to Port Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the\r\ncenter of eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and\r\nthe wall of granite, it would run the risk of being crushed in the event\r\nof any convulsion. All the exertions of the voyagers were therefore\r\nconcentrated upon the completion of the hull.\r\n\r\nThus the 3rd of March arrived, and they might calculate upon launching\r\nthe vessel in ten days.\r\n\r\nHope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this fourth\r\nyear of their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many trials. Even\r\nPencroft lost in some measure the somber taciturnity occasioned by\r\nthe devastation and ruin of his domain. His hopes, it is true, were\r\nconcentrated upon his vessel.\r\n\r\n“We shall finish it,” he said to the engineer, “we shall finish it,\r\ncaptain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the equinox\r\nwill soon be here. Well, if necessary, we must put in to Tabor island\r\nto spend the winter. But think of Tabor island after Lincoln Island. Ah,\r\nhow unfortunate! Who could have believed it possible?”\r\n\r\n“Let us get on,” was the engineer’s invariable reply.\r\n\r\nAnd they worked away without losing a moment.\r\n\r\n“Master,” asked Neb, a few days later, “do you think all this could have\r\nhappened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Neb,” answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n\r\n“I, for one, don’t believe it!” whispered Pencroft to Neb.\r\n\r\n“Nor I!” answered Neb seriously.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week of March appearances again became menacing.\r\nThousands of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava, fell like rain\r\nupon the island. The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed\r\nthe back of the volcano. The torrent flowed along the surface of the\r\nhardened tufa, and destroyed the few meager skeletons of trees which had\r\nwithstood the first eruption. The stream, flowing this time towards the\r\nsouthwest shore of Lake Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine, and\r\ninvaded the plateau of Prospect Heights. This last blow to the work of\r\nthe colonists was terrible. The mill, the buildings of the inner court,\r\nthe stables, were all destroyed. The affrighted poultry fled in all\r\ndirections. Top and Jup showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their\r\ninstinct warned them of an impending catastrophe. A large number of the\r\nanimals of the island had perished in the first eruption. Those which\r\nsurvived found no refuge but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to which the\r\nplateau of Prospect Heights afforded asylum. But even this last retreat\r\nwas now closed to them, and the lava-torrent, flowing over the edge of\r\nthe granite wall, began to pour down upon the beach its cataracts of\r\nfire. The sublime horror of this spectacle passed all description.\r\nDuring the night it could only be compared to a Niagara of molten fluid,\r\nwith its incandescent vapors above and its boiling masses below.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and although the\r\nupper seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they decided to launch\r\nher at once.\r\n\r\nPencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary preparations for\r\nthe launching, which was to take place the morning of the next day, the\r\n9th of March.\r\n\r\nBut during the night of the 8th an enormous column of vapor escaping\r\nfrom the crater rose with frightful explosions to a height of more than\r\nthree thousand feet. The wall of Dakkar Grotto had evidently given way\r\nunder the pressure of gases, and the sea, rushing through the central\r\nshaft into the igneous gulf, was at once converted into vapor. But\r\nthe crater could not afford a sufficient outlet for this vapor. An\r\nexplosion, which might have been heard at a distance of a hundred miles,\r\nshook the air. Fragments of mountains fell into the Pacific, and, in a\r\nfew minutes, the ocean rolled over the spot where Lincoln island once\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20\r\n\r\nAn isolated rock, thirty feet in length, twenty in breadth, scarcely ten\r\nfrom the water’s edge, such was the only solid point which the waves of\r\nthe Pacific had not engulfed.\r\n\r\nIt was all that remained of the structure of Granite House! The wall had\r\nfallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments, and a few of the\r\nrocks of the large room were piled one above another to form this point.\r\nAll around had disappeared in the abyss; the inferior cone of Mount\r\nFranklin, rent asunder by the explosion; the lava jaws of Shark Gulf,\r\nthe plateau of Prospect Heights, Safety Islet, the granite rocks of Port\r\nBalloon, the basalts of Dakkar Grotto, the long Serpentine Peninsula, so\r\ndistant nevertheless from the center of the eruption. All that could\r\nnow be seen of Lincoln Island was the narrow rock which now served as a\r\nrefuge to the six colonists and their dog Top.\r\n\r\nThe animals had also perished in the catastrophe; the birds, as well\r\nas those representing the fauna of the island--all either crushed or\r\ndrowned, and the unfortunate Jup himself had, alas! found his death in\r\nsome crevice of the soil.\r\n\r\nIf Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton\r\nhad survived, it was because, assembled under their tent, they had been\r\nhurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island\r\nrained down on every side.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the surface they could only perceive, at half a\r\ncable’s length, this mass of rocks, towards which they swam and on which\r\nthey found footing.\r\n\r\nOn this barren rock they had now existed for nine days. A few provisions\r\ntaken from the magazine of Granite House before the catastrophe, a\r\nlittle fresh water from the rain which had fallen in a hollow of the\r\nrock, was all that the unfortunate colonists possessed. Their last hope,\r\nthe vessel, had been shattered to pieces. They had no means of quitting\r\nthe reef; no fire, nor any means of obtaining it. It seemed that they\r\nmust inevitably perish.\r\n\r\nThis day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for two\r\ndays, although they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries\r\nof life. All their science and intelligence could avail them nothing in\r\ntheir present position. They were in the hand of God.\r\n\r\nCyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and Pencroft, a\r\nprey to sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock. Herbert did not\r\nfor a moment quit the engineer’s side, as if demanding from him that\r\nassistance he had no power to give. Neb and Ayrton were resigned to\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\n“Ah, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!” often repeated Pencroft.\r\n“If we had but a walnut-shell to take us to Tabor Island! But we have\r\nnothing, nothing!”\r\n\r\n“Captain Nemo did right to die,” said Neb.\r\n\r\nDuring the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate\r\ncompanions husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care, eating\r\nonly what would prevent them from dying of starvation. Their weakness\r\nwas extreme. Herbert and Neb began to show symptoms of delirium.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the\r\nshadow of a hope? No! What was their sole remaining chance? That a\r\nvessel should appear in sight of the rock? But they knew only too well\r\nfrom experience that no ships ever visited this part of the Pacific.\r\nCould they calculate that, by a truly providential coincidence, the\r\nScotch yacht would arrive precisely at this time in search of Ayrton\r\nat Tabor Island? It was scarcely probable; and, besides, supposing\r\nshe should come there, as the colonists had not been able to deposit\r\na notice pointing out Ayrton’s change of abode, the commander of the\r\nyacht, after having explored Tabor Island without results, would again\r\nset sail and return to lower latitudes.\r\n\r\nNo! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible death,\r\ndeath from hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this rock.\r\n\r\nAlready they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no longer\r\nconscious of what passed around them. Ayrton alone, by a supreme effort,\r\nfrom time to time raised his head, and cast a despairing glance over the\r\ndesert ocean.\r\n\r\nBut on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton’s arms were extended\r\ntoward a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first on his knees,\r\nthen upright, and his hand seemed to make a signal.\r\n\r\nA sail was in sight off the rock. She was evidently not without an\r\nobject. The reef was the mark for which she was making in a direct line,\r\nunder all steam, and the unfortunate colonists might have made her out\r\nsome hours before if they had had the strength to watch the horizon.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Duncan’!” murmured Ayrton--and fell back without sign of life.\r\n\r\nWhen Cyrus Harding and his companions recovered consciousness, thanks to\r\nthe attention lavished upon them, they found themselves in the cabin of\r\na steamer, without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death.\r\n\r\nA word from Ayrton explained everything.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Duncan’!” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Duncan’!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding. And raising his hand to Heaven,\r\nhe said, “Oh! Almighty God! mercifully hast Thou preserved us!”\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, the “Duncan,” Lord Glenarvan’s yacht, now commanded by\r\nRobert, son of Captain Grant, who had been despatched to Tabor Island to\r\nfind Ayrton, and bring him back to his native land after twelve years of\r\nexpiation.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were not only saved, but already on the way to their\r\nnative country.\r\n\r\n“Captain Grant,” asked Cyrus Harding, “who can have suggested to you the\r\nidea, after having left Tabor Island, where you did not find Ayrton, of\r\ncoming a hundred miles farther northeast?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Harding,” replied Robert Grant, “it was in order to find, not\r\nonly Ayrton, but yourself and your companions.”\r\n\r\n“My companions and myself?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, at Lincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“At Lincoln Island!” exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb,\r\nand Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished.\r\n\r\n“How could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?” inquired\r\nCyrus Harding, “it is not even named in the charts.”\r\n\r\n“I knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island,” answered\r\nRobert Grant.\r\n\r\n“A document!” cried Gideon Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Without doubt, and here it is,” answered Robert Grant, producing a\r\npaper which indicated the longitude and latitude of Lincoln Island, “the\r\npresent residence of Ayrton and five American colonists.”\r\n\r\n“It is Captain Nemo!” cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the notice,\r\nand recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of the paper\r\nfound at the corral.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Pencroft, “it was then he who took our ‘Bonadventure’ and\r\nhazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!”\r\n\r\n“In order to leave this notice,” added Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I was then right in saying,” exclaimed the sailor, “that even after his\r\ndeath the captain would render us a last service.”\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest emotion,\r\n“may the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain Nemo, our\r\nbenefactor.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus Harding,\r\nand murmured the name of Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\nThen Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, “Where should this\r\ncoffer be deposited?”\r\n\r\nIt was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his life, at\r\nthe very instant that the island had been engulfed, and which he now\r\nfaithfully handed to the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton! Ayrton!” said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched. Then, addressing\r\nRobert Grant, “Sir,” he added, “you left behind you a criminal; you find\r\nin his place a man who has become honest by penitence, and whose hand I\r\nam proud to clasp in mine.”\r\n\r\nRobert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of Captain\r\nNemo and the colonists of Lincoln Island. Then, observation being taken\r\nof what remained of this shoal, which must henceforward figure on the\r\ncharts of the Pacific, the order was given to make all sail.\r\n\r\nA few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and found their\r\ncountry once more at peace after the terrible conflict in which right\r\nand justice had triumphed.\r\n\r\nOf the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to the\r\ncolonists of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in the\r\npurchase of a vast territory in the State of Iowa. One pearl alone, the\r\nfinest, was reserved from the treasure and sent to Lady Glenarvan in the\r\nname of the castaways restored to their country by the “Duncan.”\r\n\r\nThere, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is to say,\r\nto wealth and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped to offer the\r\nhospitality of Lincoln Island. There was founded a vast colony to\r\nwhich they gave the name of that island sunk beneath the waters of the\r\nPacific. A river there was called the Mercy, a mountain took the name\r\nof Mount Franklin, a small lake was named Lake Grant, and the forests\r\nbecame the forests of the Far West. It might have been an island on\r\nterra firma.\r\n\r\nThere, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions,\r\neverything prospered. Not one of the former colonists of Lincoln Island\r\nwas absent, for they had sworn to live always together. Neb was with his\r\nmaster; Ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft\r\nwas more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor; Herbert, who completed\r\nhis studies under the superintendence of Cyrus Harding, and Gideon\r\nSpilett, who founded the New Lincoln Herald, the best-informed journal\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThere Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals visits from\r\nLord and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his wife, the sister\r\nof Robert Grant, Robert Grant himself, Major McNab, and all those who\r\nhad taken part in the history both of Captain Grant and Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\nThere, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as they had\r\nbeen in the past; but never could they forget that island upon which\r\nthey had arrived poor and friendless, that island which, during four\r\nyears had supplied all their wants, and of which there remained but a\r\nfragment of granite washed by the waves of the Pacific, the tomb of him\r\nwho had borne the name of Captain Nemo.",
