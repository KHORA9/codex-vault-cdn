He lived with his father and\r\nmother in a cottage built on a mountain, and he worked with his father\r\ninside the mountain.\r\n\r\nA mountain is a strange and awful thing.  In old times, without knowing\r\nso much of their strangeness and awfulness as we do, people were yet\r\nmore afraid of mountains.  But then somehow they had not come to see\r\nhow beautiful they are as well as awful, and they hated them--and what\r\npeople hate they must fear.  Now that we have learned to look at them\r\nwith admiration, perhaps we do not feel quite awe enough of them.  To\r\nme they are beautiful terrors.\r\n\r\nI will try to tell you what they are.  They are portions of the heart\r\nof the earth that have escaped from the dungeon down below, and rushed\r\nup and out.  For the heart of the earth is a great wallowing mass, not\r\nof blood, as in the hearts of men and animals, but of glowing hot,\r\nmelted metals and stones.  And as our hearts keep us alive, so that\r\ngreat lump of heat keeps the earth alive: it is a huge power of buried\r\nsunlight--that is what it is.\r\n\r\nNow think: out of that cauldron, where all the bubbles would be as big\r\nas the Alps if it could get room for its boiling, certain bubbles have\r\nbubbled out and escaped--up and away, and there they stand in the cool,\r\ncold sky--mountains.  Think of the change, and you will no more wonder\r\nthat there should be something awful about the very look of a mountain:\r\nfrom the darkness--for where the light has nothing to shine upon, much\r\nthe same as darkness--from the heat, from the endless tumult of boiling\r\nunrest--up, with a sudden heavenward shoot, into the wind, and the\r\ncold, and the starshine, and a cloak of snow that lies like ermine\r\nabove the blue-green mail of the glaciers; and the great sun, their\r\ngrandfather, up there in the sky; and their little old cold aunt, the\r\nmoon, that comes wandering about the house at night; and everlasting\r\nstillness, except for the wind that turns the rocks and caverns into a\r\nroaring organ for the young archangels that are studying how to let out\r\nthe pent-up praises of their hearts, and the molten music of the\r\nstreams, rushing ever from the bosoms of the glaciers fresh born.\r\n\r\nThink, too, of the change in their own substance--no longer molten and\r\nsoft, heaving and glowing, but hard and shining and cold. Think of the\r\ncreatures scampering over and burrowing in it, and the birds building\r\ntheir nests upon it, and the trees growing out of its sides, like hair\r\nto clothe it, and the lovely grass in the valleys, and the gracious\r\nflowers even at the very edge of its armour of ice, like the rich\r\nembroidery of the garment below, and the rivers galloping down the\r\nvalleys in a tumult of white and green!  And along with all these,\r\nthink of the terrible precipices down which the traveller may fall and\r\nbe lost, and the frightful gulfs of blue air cracked in the glaciers,\r\nand the dark profound lakes, covered like little arctic oceans with\r\nfloating lumps of ice.\r\n\r\nAll this outside the mountain!  But the inside, who shall tell what\r\nlies there?  Caverns of awfullest solitude, their walls miles thick,\r\nsparkling with ores of gold or silver, copper or iron, tin or mercury,\r\nstudded perhaps with precious stones--perhaps a brook, with eyeless\r\nfish in it, running, running ceaselessly, cold and babbling, through\r\nbanks crusted with carbuncles and golden topazes, or over a gravel of\r\nwhich some of the stones arc rubies and emeralds, perhaps diamonds and\r\nsapphires--who can tell?--and whoever can't tell is free to think--all\r\nwaiting to flash, waiting for millions of ages--ever since the earth\r\nflew off from the sun, a great blot of fire, and began to cool.\r\n\r\nThen there are caverns full of water, numbingly cold, fiercely\r\nhot--hotter than any boiling water.  From some of these the water\r\ncannot get out, and from others it runs in channels as the blood in the\r\nbody: little veins bring it down from the ice above into the great\r\ncaverns of the mountain's heart, whence the arteries let it out again,\r\ngushing in pipes and clefts and ducts of all shapes and kinds, through\r\nand through its bulk, until it springs newborn to the light, and rushes\r\ndown the Mountainside in torrents, and down the valleys in\r\nrivers--down, down, rejoicing, to the mighty lungs of the world, that\r\nis the sea, where it is tossed in storms and cyclones, heaved up in\r\nbillows, twisted in waterspouts, dashed to mist upon rocks, beaten by\r\nmillions of tails, and breathed by millions of gills, whence at last,\r\nmelted into vapour by the sun, it is lifted up pure into the air, and\r\nborne by the servant winds back to the mountaintops and the snow, the\r\nsolid ice, and the molten stream.\r\n\r\nWell, when the heart of the earth has thus come rushing up among her\r\nchildren, bringing with it gifts of all that she possesses, then\r\nstraightway into it rush her children to see what they can find there.\r\nWith pickaxe and spade and crowbar, with boring chisel and blasting\r\npowder, they force their way back: is it to search for what toys they\r\nmay have left in their long-forgotten nurseries? Hence the mountains\r\nthat lift their heads into the clear air, and are dotted over with the\r\ndwellings of men, are tunnelled and bored in the darkness of their\r\nbosoms by the dwellers in the houses which they hold up to the sun and\r\nair.\r\n\r\nCurdie and his father were of these: their business was to bring to\r\nlight hidden things; they sought silver in the rock and found it, and\r\ncarried it out.  Of the many other precious things in their mountain\r\nthey knew little or nothing.  Silver ore was what they were sent to\r\nfind, and in darkness and danger they found it.  But oh, how sweet was\r\nthe air on the mountain face when they came out at sunset to go home to\r\nwife and mother!  They did breathe deep then!\r\n\r\nThe mines belonged to the king of the country, and the miners were his\r\nservants, working under his overseers and officers.  He was a real\r\nking--that is, one who ruled for the good of his people and not to\r\nplease himself, and he wanted the silver not to buy rich things for\r\nhimself, but to help him to govern the country, and pay the ones that\r\ndefended it from certain troublesome neighbours, and the judges whom he\r\nset to portion out righteousness among the people, that so they might\r\nlearn it themselves, and come to do without judges at all.  Nothing\r\nthat could be got from the heart of the earth could have been put to\r\nbetter purposes than the silver the king's miners got for him.  There\r\nwere people in the country who, when it came into their hands, degraded\r\nit by locking it up in a chest, and then it grew diseased and was\r\ncalled mammon, and bred all sorts of quarrels; but when first it left\r\nthe king's hands it never made any but friends, and the air of the\r\nworld kept it clean.\r\n\r\nAbout a year before this story began, a series of very remarkable\r\nevents had just ended.  I will narrate as much of them as will serve to\r\nshow the tops of the roots of my tree.\r\n\r\nUpon the mountain, on one of its many claws, stood a grand old house,\r\nhalf farmhouse, half castle, belonging to the king; and there his only\r\nchild, the Princess Irene, had been brought up till she was nearly nine\r\nyears old, and would doubtless have continued much longer, but for the\r\nstrange events to which I have referred.\r\n\r\nAt that time the hollow places of the mountain were inhabited by\r\ncreatures called goblins, who for various reasons and in various ways\r\nmade themselves troublesome to all, but to the little princess\r\ndangerous.  Mainly by the watchful devotion and energy of Curdie,\r\nhowever, their designs had been utterly defeated, and made to recoil\r\nupon themselves to their own destruction, so that now there were very\r\nfew of them left alive, and the miners did not believe there was a\r\nsingle goblin remaining in the whole inside of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe king had been so pleased with the boy--then approaching thirteen\r\nyears of age--that when he carried away his daughter he asked him to\r\naccompany them; but he was still better pleased with him when he found\r\nthat he preferred staying with his father and mother.  He was a right\r\ngood king and knew that the love of a boy who would not leave his\r\nfather and mother to be made a great man was worth ten thousand offers\r\nto die for his sake, and would prove so when the right time came.  As\r\nfor his father and mother, they would have given him up without a\r\ngrumble, for they were just as good as the king, and he and they\r\nunderstood each other perfectly; but in this matter, not seeing that he\r\ncould do anything for the king which one of his numerous attendants\r\ncould not do as well, Curdie felt that it was for him to decide.  So\r\nthe king took a kind farewell of them all and rode away, with his\r\ndaughter on his horse before him.\r\n\r\nA gloom fell upon the mountain and the miners when she was gone, and\r\nCurdie did not whistle for a whole week.  As for his verses, there was\r\nno occasion to make any now.  He had made them only to drive away the\r\ngoblins, and they were all gone--a good riddance--only the princess was\r\ngone too!  He would rather have had things as they were, except for the\r\nprincess's sake.  But whoever is diligent will soon be cheerful, and\r\nthough the miners missed the household of the castle, they yet managed\r\nto get on without them. Peter and his wife, however, were troubled with\r\nthe fancy that they had stood in the way of their boy's good fortune.\r\nIt would have been such a fine thing for him and them, too, they\r\nthought, if he had ridden with the good king's train.  How beautiful he\r\nlooked, they said, when he rode the king's own horse through the river\r\nthat the goblins had sent out of the hill!  He might soon have been a\r\ncaptain, they did believe!  The good, kind people did not reflect that\r\nthe road to the next duty is the only straight one, or that, for their\r\nfancied good, we should never wish our children or friends to do what\r\nwe would not do ourselves if we were in their position.  We must accept\r\nrighteous sacrifices as well as make them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nThe White Pigeon\r\n\r\nWhen in the winter they had had their supper and sat about the fire, or\r\nwhen in the summer they lay on the border of the rock-margined stream\r\nthat ran through their little meadow close by the door of their\r\ncottage, issuing from the far-up whiteness often folded in clouds,\r\nCurdie's mother would not seldom lead the conversation to one peculiar\r\npersonage said and believed to have been much concerned in the late\r\nissue of events.\r\n\r\nThat personage was the great-great-grandmother of the princess, of whom\r\nthe princess had often talked, but whom neither Curdie nor his mother\r\nhad ever seen.  Curdie could indeed remember, although already it\r\nlooked more like a dream than he could account for if it had really\r\ntaken place, how the princess had once led him up many stairs to what\r\nshe called a beautiful room in the top of the tower, where she went\r\nthrough all the--what should he call it?--the behaviour of presenting\r\nhim to her grandmother, talking now to her and now to him, while all\r\nthe time he saw nothing but a bare garret, a heap of musty straw, a\r\nsunbeam, and a withered apple. Lady, he would have declared before the\r\nking himself, young or old, there was none, except the princess\r\nherself, who was certainly vexed that he could not see what she at\r\nleast believed she saw.\r\n\r\nAs for his mother, she had once seen, long before Curdie was born, a\r\ncertain mysterious light of the same description as one Irene spoke of,\r\ncalling it her grandmother's moon; and Curdie himself had seen this\r\nsame light, shining from above the castle, just as the king and\r\nprincess were taking their leave.  Since that time neither had seen or\r\nheard anything that could be supposed connected with her.  Strangely\r\nenough, however, nobody had seen her go away.  If she was such an old\r\nlady, she could hardly be supposed to have set out alone and on foot\r\nwhen all the house was asleep.  Still, away she must have gone, for, of\r\ncourse, if she was so powerful, she would always be about the princess\r\nto take care of her.\r\n\r\nBut as Curdie grew older, he doubted more and more whether Irene had\r\nnot been talking of some dream she had taken for reality: he had heard\r\nit said that children could not always distinguish betwixt dreams and\r\nactual events.  At the same time there was his mother's testimony: what\r\nwas he to do with that?  His mother, through whom he had learned\r\neverything, could hardly be imagined by her own dutiful son to have\r\nmistaken a dream for a fact of the waking world.\r\n\r\nSo he rather shrank from thinking about it, and the less he thought\r\nabout it, the less he was inclined to believe it when he did think\r\nabout it, and therefore, of course, the less inclined to talk about it\r\nto his father and mother; for although his father was one of those men\r\nwho for one word they say think twenty thoughts, Curdie was well\r\nassured that he would rather doubt his own eyes than his wife's\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nThere were no others to whom he could have talked about it.  The miners\r\nwere a mingled company--some good, some not so good, some rather\r\nbad--none of them so bad or so good as they might have been; Curdie\r\nliked most of them, and was a favourite with all; but they knew very\r\nlittle about the upper world, and what might or might not take place\r\nthere.  They knew silver from copper ore; they understood the\r\nunderground ways of things, and they could look very wise with their\r\nlanterns in their hands searching after this or that sign of ore, or\r\nfor some mark to guide their way in the hollows of the earth; but as to\r\ngreat-great-grandmothers, they would have mocked Curdie all the rest of\r\nhis life for the absurdity of not being absolutely certain that the\r\nsolemn belief of his father and mother was nothing but ridiculous\r\nnonsense.  Why, to them the very word 'great-great-grandmother' would\r\nhave been a week's laughter!  I am not sure that they were able quite\r\nto believe there were such persons as great-great-grandmothers; they\r\nhad never seen one.  They were not companions to give the best of help\r\ntoward progress, and as Curdie grew, he grew at this time faster in\r\nbody than in mind--with the usual consequence, that he was getting\r\nrather stupid--one of the chief signs of which was that he believed\r\nless and less in things he had never seen.  At the same time I do not\r\nthink he was ever so stupid as to imagine that this was a sign of\r\nsuperior faculty and strength of mind.  Still, he was becoming more and\r\nmore a miner, and less and less a man of the upper world where the wind\r\nblew.  On his way to and from the mine he took less and less notice of\r\nbees and butterflies, moths and dragonflies, the flowers and the brooks\r\nand the clouds.  He was gradually changing into a commonplace man.\r\n\r\nThere is this difference between the growth of some human beings and\r\nthat of others: in the one case it is a continuous dying, in the other\r\na continuous resurrection.  One of the latter sort comes at length to\r\nknow at once whether a thing is true the moment it comes before him;\r\none of the former class grows more and more afraid of being taken in,\r\nso afraid of it that he takes himself in altogether, and comes at\r\nlength to believe in nothing but his dinner: to be sure of a thing with\r\nhim is to have it between his teeth.\r\n\r\nCurdie was not in a very good way, then, at that time.  His father and\r\nmother had, it is true, no fault to find with him and yet--and\r\nyet--neither of them was ready to sing when the thought of him came up.\r\nThere must be something wrong when a mother catches herself sighing\r\nover the time when her boy was in petticoats, or a father looks sad\r\nwhen he thinks how he used to carry him on his shoulder.  The boy\r\nshould enclose and keep, as his life, the old child at the heart of\r\nhim, and never let it go.  He must still, to be a right man, be his\r\nmother's darling, and more, his father's pride, and more.  The child is\r\nnot meant to die, but to be forever fresh born.\r\n\r\nCurdie had made himself a bow and some arrows, and was teaching himself\r\nto shoot with them.  One evening in the early summer, as he was walking\r\nhome from the mine with them in his hand, a light flashed across his\r\neyes.  He looked, and there was a snow-white pigeon settling on a rock\r\nin front of him, in the red light of the level sun.  There it fell at\r\nonce to work with one of its wings, in which a feather or two had got\r\nsome sprays twisted, causing a certain roughness unpleasant to the\r\nfastidious creature of the air.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a lovely being, and Curdie thought how happy it must be\r\nflitting through the air with a flash--a live bolt of light. For a\r\nmoment he became so one with the bird that he seemed to feel both its\r\nbill and its feathers, as the one adjusted the other to fly again, and\r\nhis heart swelled with the pleasure of its involuntary sympathy.\r\nAnother moment and it would have been aloft in the waves of rosy\r\nlight--it was just bending its little legs to spring: that moment it\r\nfell on the path broken-winged and bleeding from Curdie's cruel arrow.\r\n\r\nWith a gush of pride at his skill, and pleasure at his success, he ran\r\nto pick up his prey.  I must say for him he picked it up\r\ngently--perhaps it was the beginning of his repentance.  But when he\r\nhad the white thing in his hands its whiteness stained with another red\r\nthan that of the sunset flood in which it had been revelling--ah God!\r\nwho knows the joy of a bird, the ecstasy of a creature that has neither\r\nstorehouse nor barn!--when he held it, I say, in his victorious hands,\r\nthe winged thing looked up in his face--and with such eyes!--asking\r\nwhat was the matter, and where the red sun had gone, and the clouds,\r\nand the wind of its flight.  Then they closed, but to open again\r\npresently, with the same questions in them.\r\n\r\nAnd as they closed and opened, their look was fixed on his.  It did not\r\nonce flutter or try to get away; it only throbbed and bled and looked\r\nat him.  Curdie's heart began to grow very large in his bosom.  What\r\ncould it mean?  It was nothing but a pigeon, and why should he not kill\r\na pigeon?  But the fact was that not till this very moment had he ever\r\nknown what a pigeon was.  A good many discoveries of a similar kind\r\nhave to be made by most of us.  Once more it opened its eyes--then\r\nclosed them again, and its throbbing ceased.  Curdie gave a sob: its\r\nlast look reminded him of the princess--he did not know why.  He\r\nremembered how hard he had laboured to set her beyond danger, and yet\r\nwhat dangers she had had to encounter for his sake: they had been\r\nsaviours to each other--and what had he done now?  He had stopped\r\nsaving, and had begun killing!  What had he been sent into the world\r\nfor?  Surely not to be a death to its joy and loveliness.  He had done\r\nthe thing that was contrary to gladness; he was a destroyer!  He was\r\nnot the Curdie he had been meant to be!\r\n\r\nThen the underground waters gushed from the boy's heart.  And with the\r\ntears came the remembrance that a white pigeon, just before the\r\nprincess went away with her father, came from somewhere--yes, from the\r\ngrandmother's lamp, and flew round the king and Irene and himself, and\r\nthen flew away: this might be that very pigeon! Horrible to think!  And\r\nif it wasn't, yet it was a white pigeon, the same as this.  And if she\r\nkept a great Many pigeons--and white ones, as Irene had told him, then\r\nwhose pigeon could he have killed but the grand old princess's?\r\n\r\nSuddenly everything round about him seemed against him.  The red sunset\r\nstung him; the rocks frowned at him; the sweet wind that had been\r\nlaving his face as he walked up the hill dropped--as if he wasn't fit\r\nto be kissed any more.  Was the whole world going to cast him out?\r\nWould he have to stand there forever, not knowing what to do, with the\r\ndead pigeon in his hand?  Things looked bad indeed.  Was the whole\r\nworld going to make a work about a pigeon--a white pigeon?  The sun\r\nwent down.  Great clouds gathered over the west, and shortened the\r\ntwilight.  The wind gave a howl, and then lay down again.  The clouds\r\ngathered thicker.  Then came a rumbling.  He thought it was thunder.\r\nIt was a rock that fell inside the mountain.  A goat ran past him down\r\nthe hill, followed by a dog sent to fetch him home.  He thought they\r\nwere goblin creatures, and trembled.  He used to despise them.  And\r\nstill he held the dead pigeon tenderly in his hand.\r\n\r\nIt grew darker and darker.  An evil something began to move in his\r\nheart.  'What a fool I am!' he said to himself.  Then he grew angry,\r\nand was just going to throw the bird from him and whistle, when a\r\nbrightness shone all round him.  He lifted his eyes, and saw a great\r\nglobe of light--like silver at the hottest heat: he had once seen\r\nsilver run from the furnace.  It shone from somewhere above the roofs\r\nof the castle: it must be the great old princess's moon!  How could she\r\nbe there?  Of course she was not there!  He had asked the whole\r\nhousehold, and nobody knew anything about her or her globe either.  It\r\ncouldn't be!  And yet what did that signify, when there was the white\r\nglobe shining, and here was the dead white bird in his hand?  That\r\nmoment the pigeon gave a little flutter.  'It's not dead!' cried\r\nCurdie, almost with a shriek.  The same instant he was running full\r\nspeed toward the castle, never letting his heels down, lest he should\r\nshake the poor, wounded bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nThe Mistress of the Silver Moon\r\n\r\nWhen Curdie reached the castle, and ran into the little garden in front\r\nof it, there stood the door wide open.  This was as he had hoped, for\r\nwhat could he have said if he had had to knock at it? Those whose\r\nbusiness it is to open doors, so often mistake and shut them!  But the\r\nwoman now in charge often puzzled herself greatly to account for the\r\nstrange fact that however often she shut the door, which, like the\r\nrest, she took a great deal of unnecessary trouble to do, she was\r\ncertain, the next time she went to it, to find it open.  I speak now of\r\nthe great front door, of course: the back door she as persistently kept\r\nwide: if people could only go in by that, she said, she would then know\r\nwhat sort they were, and what they wanted.  But she would neither have\r\nknown what sort Curdie was, nor what he wanted, and would assuredly\r\nhave denied him admittance, for she knew nothing of who was in the\r\ntower.  So the front door was left open for him, and in he walked.\r\n\r\nBut where to go next he could not tell.  It was not quite dark: a dull,\r\nshineless twilight filled the place.  All he knew was that he must go\r\nup, and that proved enough for the present, for there he saw the great\r\nstaircase rising before him.  When he reached the top of it, he knew\r\nthere must be more stairs yet, for he could not be near the top of the\r\ntower.  Indeed by the situation of the stairs, he must be a good way\r\nfrom the tower itself.  But those who work well in the depths more\r\neasily understand the heights, for indeed in their true nature they are\r\none and the same; miners are in mountains; and Curdie, from knowing the\r\nways of the king's mines, and being able to calculate his whereabouts\r\nin them, was now able to find his way about the king's house.  He knew\r\nits outside perfectly, and now his business was to get his notion of\r\nthe inside right with the outside.\r\n\r\nSo he shut his eyes and made a picture of the outside of it in his\r\nmind.  Then he came in at the door of the picture, and yet kept the\r\npicture before him all the time--for you can do that kind of thing in\r\nyour mind--and took every turn of the stair over again, always watching\r\nto remember, every time he turned his face, how the tower lay, and then\r\nwhen he came to himself at the top where he stood, he knew exactly\r\nwhere it was, and walked at once in the right direction.\r\n\r\nOn his way, however, he came to another stair, and up that he went, of\r\ncourse, watching still at every turn how the tower must lie.  At the\r\ntop of this stair was yet another--they were the stairs up which the\r\nprincess ran when first, without knowing it, she was on her way to find\r\nher great-great-grandmother.  At the top of the second stair he could\r\ngo no farther, and must therefore set out again to find the tower,\r\nwhich, as it rose far above the rest of the house, must have the last\r\nof its stairs inside itself.\r\n\r\nHaving watched every turn to the very last, he still knew quite well in\r\nwhat direction he must go to find it, so he left the stair and went\r\ndown a passage that led, if not exactly toward it, yet nearer it.  This\r\npassage was rather dark, for it was very long, with only one window at\r\nthe end, and although there were doors on both sides of it, they were\r\nall shut.  At the distant window glimmered the chill east, with a few\r\nfeeble stars in it, and its like was dreary and old, growing brown, and\r\nlooking as if it were thinking about the day that was just gone.\r\nPresently he turned into another passage, which also had a window at\r\nthe end of it; and in at that window shone all that was left of the\r\nsunset, just a few ashes, with here and there a little touch of warmth:\r\nit was nearly as sad as the east, only there was one difference--it was\r\nvery plainly thinking of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBut at present Curdie had nothing to do with today or tomorrow; his\r\nbusiness was with the bird, and the tower where dwelt the grand old\r\nprincess to whom it belonged.  So he kept on his way, still eastward,\r\nand came to yet another passage, which brought him to a door.  He was\r\nafraid to open it without first knocking.  He knocked, but heard no\r\nanswer.  He was answered nevertheless; for the door gently opened, and\r\nthere was a narrow stair--and so steep that, big lad as he was, he,\r\ntoo, like the Princess Irene before him, found his hands needful for\r\nthe climbing.  And it was a long climb, but he reached the top at\r\nlast--a little landing, with a door in front and one on each side.\r\nWhich should he knock at?\r\n\r\nAs he hesitated, he heard the noise of a spinning wheel.  He knew it at\r\nonce, because his mother's spinning wheel had been his governess long\r\nago, and still taught him things.  It was the spinning wheel that first\r\ntaught him to make verses, and to sing, and to think whether all was\r\nright inside him; or at least it had helped him in all these things.\r\nHence it was no wonder he should know a spinning wheel when he heard it\r\nsing--even although as the bird of paradise to other birds was the song\r\nof that wheel to the song of his mother's.\r\n\r\nHe stood listening, so entranced that he forgot to knock, and the wheel\r\nwent on and on, spinning in his brain songs and tales and rhymes, till\r\nhe was almost asleep as well as dreaming, for sleep does not always\r\ncome first.  But suddenly came the thought of the poor bird, which had\r\nbeen lying motionless in his hand all the time, and that woke him up,\r\nand at once he knocked.\r\n\r\n'Come in, Curdie,' said a voice.\r\n\r\nCurdie shook.  It was getting rather awful.  The heart that had never\r\nmuch heeded an army of goblins trembled at the soft word of invitation.\r\nBut then there was the red-spotted white thing in his hand!  He dared\r\nnot hesitate, though.  Gently he opened the door through which the\r\nsound came, and what did he see?  Nothing at first--except indeed a\r\ngreat sloping shaft of moonlight that came in at a high window, and\r\nrested on the floor.  He stood and stared at it, forgetting to shut the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n'Why don't you come in, Curdie?' said the voice.  'Did you never see\r\nmoonlight before?'\r\n\r\n'Never without a moon,' answered Curdie, in a trembling tone, but\r\ngathering courage.\r\n\r\n'Certainly not,' returned the voice, which was thin and quavering: 'I\r\nnever saw moonlight without a moon.'\r\n\r\n'But there's no moon outside,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Ah! but you're inside now,' said the voice.\r\n\r\nThe answer did not satisfy Curdie; but the voice went on.\r\n\r\n'There are more moons than you know of, Curdie.  Where there is one sun\r\nthere are many moons--and of many sorts.  Come in and look out of my\r\nwindow, and you will soon satisfy yourself that there is a moon looking\r\nin at it.'\r\n\r\nThe gentleness of the voice made Curdie remember his manners.  He shut\r\nthe door, and drew a step or two nearer to the moonlight.\r\n\r\nAll the time the sound of the spinning had been going on and on, and\r\nCurdie now caught sight of the wheel.  Oh, it was such a thin, delicate\r\nthing--reminding him of a spider's web in a hedge.  It stood in the\r\nmiddle of the moonlight, and it seemed as if the moonlight had nearly\r\nmelted it away.  A step nearer, he saw, with a start, two little hands\r\nat work with it.  And then at last, in the shadow on the other side of\r\nthe moonlight which came like silver between, he saw the form to which\r\nthe hands belonged: a small withered creature, so old that no age would\r\nhave seemed too great to write under her picture, seated on a stool\r\nbeyond the spinning wheel, which looked very large beside her, but, as\r\nI said, very thin, like a long-legged spider holding up its own web,\r\nwhich was the round wheel itself She sat crumpled together, a filmy\r\nthing that it seemed a puff would blow away, more like the body of a\r\nfly the big spider had sucked empty and left hanging in his web, than\r\nanything else I can think of.\r\n\r\nWhen Curdie saw her, he stood still again, a good deal in wonder, a\r\nvery little in reverence, a little in doubt, and, I must add, a little\r\nin amusement at the odd look of the old marvel.  Her grey hair mixed\r\nwith the moonlight so that he could not tell where the one began and\r\nthe other ended.  Her crooked back bent forward over her chest, her\r\nshoulders nearly swallowed up her head between them, and her two little\r\nhands were just like the grey claws of a hen, scratching at the thread,\r\nwhich to Curdie was of course invisible across the moonlight.  Indeed\r\nCurdie laughed within himself, just a little, at the sight; and when he\r\nthought of how the princess used to talk about her huge, great, old\r\ngrandmother, he laughed more.  But that moment the little lady leaned\r\nforward into the moonlight, and Curdie caught a glimpse of her eyes,\r\nand all the laugh went out of him.\r\n\r\n'What do you come here for, Curdie?' she said, as gently as before.\r\n\r\nThen Curdie remembered that he stood there as a culprit, and worst of\r\nall, as one who had his confession yet to make.  There was no time to\r\nhesitate over it.\r\n\r\n'Oh, ma'am!  See here,' he said, and advanced a step or two, holding\r\nout the pigeon.\r\n\r\n'What have you got there?' she asked.\r\n\r\nAgain Curdie advanced a few steps, and held out his hand with the\r\npigeon, that she might see what it was, into the moonlight.  The moment\r\nthe rays fell upon it the pigeon gave a faint flutter.  The old lady\r\nput out her old hands and took it, and held it to her bosom, and rocked\r\nit, murmuring over it as if it were a sick baby.\r\n\r\nWhen Curdie saw how distressed she was he grew sorrier still, and said:\r\n\r\n'I didn't mean to do any harm, ma'am.  I didn't think of its being\r\nyours.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, Curdie!  If it weren't mine, what would become of it now?' she\r\nreturned.  'You say you didn't mean any harm: did you mean any good,\r\nCurdie?'\r\n\r\n'No,' answered Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Remember, then, that whoever does not mean good is always in danger of\r\nharm.  But I try to give everybody fair play; and those that are in the\r\nwrong are in far more need of it always than those who are in the\r\nright: they can afford to do without it.  Therefore I say for you that\r\nwhen you shot that arrow you did not know what a pigeon is.  Now that\r\nyou do know, you are sorry.  It is very dangerous to do things you\r\ndon't know about.'\r\n\r\n'But, please, ma'am--I don't mean to be rude or to contradict you,'\r\nsaid Curdie, 'but if a body was never to do anything but what he knew\r\nto be good, he would have to live half his time doing nothing.'\r\n\r\n'There you are much mistaken,' said the old quavering voice.  'How\r\nlittle you must have thought!  Why, you don't seem even to know the\r\ngood of the things you are constantly doing.  Now don't mistake me. I\r\ndon't mean you are good for doing them.  It is a good thing to eat your\r\nbreakfast, but you don't fancy it's very good of you to do it.  The\r\nthing is good, not you.'\r\n\r\nCurdie laughed.\r\n\r\n'There are a great many more good things than bad things to do. Now\r\ntell me what bad thing you have done today besides this sore hurt to my\r\nlittle white friend.'\r\n\r\nWhile she talked Curdie had sunk into a sort of reverie, in which he\r\nhardly knew whether it was the old lady or his own heart that spoke.\r\nAnd when she asked him that question, he was at first much inclined to\r\nconsider himself a very good fellow on the whole.  'I really don't\r\nthink I did anything else that was very bad all day,' he said to\r\nhimself.  But at the same time he could not honestly feel that he was\r\nworth standing up for.  All at once a light seemed to break in upon his\r\nmind, and he woke up and there was the withered little atomy of the old\r\nlady on the other side of the moonlight, and there was the spinning\r\nwheel singing on and on in the middle of it!\r\n\r\n'I know now, ma'am; I understand now,' he said.  'Thank you, ma'am, for\r\nspinning it into me with your wheel.  I see now that I have been doing\r\nwrong the whole day, and such a many days besides! Indeed, I don't know\r\nwhen I ever did right, and yet it seems as if I had done right some\r\ntime and had forgotten how.  When I killed your bird I did not know I\r\nwas doing wrong, just because I was always doing wrong, and the wrong\r\nhad soaked all through me.'\r\n\r\n'What wrong were you doing all day, Curdie?  It is better to come to\r\nthe point, you know,' said the old lady, and her voice was gentler even\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n'I was doing the wrong of never wanting or trying to be better. And now\r\nI see that I have been letting things go as they would for a long time.\r\nWhatever came into my head I did, and whatever didn't come into my head\r\nI didn't do.  I never sent anything away, and never looked out for\r\nanything to come.  I haven't been attending to my mother--or my father\r\neither.  And now I think of it, I know I have often seen them looking\r\ntroubled, and I have never asked them what was the matter.  And now I\r\nsee, too, that I did not ask because I suspected it had something to do\r\nwith me and my behaviour, and didn't want to hear the truth.  And I\r\nknow I have been grumbling at my work, and doing a hundred other things\r\nthat are wrong.'\r\n\r\n'You have got it, Curdie,' said the old lady, in a voice that sounded\r\nalmost as if she had been crying.  'When people don't care to be better\r\nthey must be doing everything wrong.  I am so glad you shot my bird!'\r\n\r\n'Ma'am!' exclaimed Curdie.  'How can you be?'\r\n\r\n'Because it has brought you to see what sort you were when you did it,\r\nand what sort you will grow to be again, only worse, if you don't mind.\r\nNow that you are sorry, my poor bird will be better. Look up, my dovey.'\r\n\r\nThe pigeon gave a flutter, and spread out one of its red-spotted wings\r\nacross the old woman's bosom.\r\n\r\n'I will mend the little angel,' she said, 'and in a week or two it will\r\nbe flying again.  So you may ease your heart about the pigeon.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, thank you!  Thank you!' cried Curdie.  'I don't know how to thank\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'Then I will tell you.  There is only one way I care for.  Do better,\r\nand grow better, and be better.  And never kill anything without a good\r\nreason for it.'\r\n\r\n'Ma'am, I will go and fetch my bow and arrows, and you shall burn them\r\nyourself.'\r\n\r\n'I have no fire that would burn your bow and arrows, Curdie.'\r\n\r\n'Then I promise you to burn them all under my mother's porridge pot\r\ntomorrow morning.'\r\n\r\n'No, no, Curdie.  Keep them, and practice with them every day, and grow\r\na good shot.  There are plenty of bad things that want killing, and a\r\nday will come when they will prove useful.  But I must see first\r\nwhether you will do as I tell you.'\r\n\r\n'That I will!' said Curdie.  'What is it, ma'am?'\r\n\r\n'Only something not to do,' answered the old lady; 'if you should hear\r\nanyone speak about me, never to laugh or make fun of me.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, ma'am!' exclaimed Curdie, shocked that she should think such a\r\nrequest needful.\r\n\r\n'Stop, stop,' she went on.  'People hereabout sometimes tell very odd\r\nand in fact ridiculous stories of an old woman who watches what is\r\ngoing on, and occasionally interferes.  They mean me, though what they\r\nsay is often great nonsense.  Now what I want of you is not to laugh,\r\nor side with them in any way; because they will take that to mean that\r\nyou don't believe there is any such person a bit more than they do.\r\nNow that would not be the case--would it, Curdie?'\r\n\r\n'No, indeed, ma'am.  I've seen you.'\r\n\r\nThe old woman smiled very oddly.\r\n\r\n'Yes, you've seen me,' she said.  'But mind,' she continued, 'I don't\r\nwant you to say anything--only to hold your tongue, and not seem to\r\nside with them.'\r\n\r\n'That will be easy,'said Curdie,'now that I've seen you with my very\r\nown eyes, ma'am.'\r\n\r\n'Not so easy as you think, perhaps,' said the old lady, with another\r\ncurious smile.  'I want to be your friend,' she added after a little\r\npause, 'but I don't quite know yet whether you will let me.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed I will, ma'am,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'That is for me to find out,' she rejoined, with yet another strange\r\nsmile.  'In the meantime all I can say is, come to me again when you\r\nfind yourself in any trouble, and I will see what I can do for\r\nyou--only the canning depends on yourself.  I am greatly pleased with\r\nyou for bringing me my pigeon, doing your best to set right what you\r\nhad set wrong.'\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she held out her hand to him, and when he took it she made\r\nuse of his to help herself up from her stool, and--when or how it came\r\nabout, Curdie could not tell--the same instant she stood before him a\r\ntall, strong woman--plainly very old, but as grand as she was old, and\r\nonly rather severe-looking.  Every trace of the decrepitude and\r\nwitheredness she showed as she hovered like a film about her wheel, had\r\nvanished.  Her hair was very white, but it hung about her head in great\r\nplenty, and shone like silver in the moonlight.  Straight as a pillar\r\nshe stood before the astonished boy, and the wounded bird had now\r\nspread out both its wings across her bosom, like some great mystical\r\nornament of frosted silver.\r\n\r\n'Oh, now I can never forget you!' cried Curdie.  'I see now what you\r\nreally are!'\r\n\r\n'Did I not tell you the truth when I sat at my wheel?' said the old\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n'Yes, ma'am,' answered Curdie.\r\n\r\n'I can do no more than tell you the truth now,' she rejoined.  'It is a\r\nbad thing indeed to forget one who has told us the truth.  Now go.'\r\n\r\nCurdie obeyed, and took a few steps toward the door.  'Please,\r\nma'am--what am I to call you?' he was going to say; but when he turned\r\nto speak, he saw nobody.  Whether she was there or not he could not\r\ntell, however, for the moonlight had vanished, and the room was utterly\r\ndark.  A great fear, such as he had never before known, came upon him,\r\nand almost overwhelmed him.  He groped his way to the door, and crawled\r\ndown the stair--in doubt and anxiety as to how he should find his way\r\nout of the house in the dark.  And the stair seemed ever so much longer\r\nthan when he came up.  Nor was that any wonder, for down and down he\r\nwent, until at length his foot struck a door, and when he rose and\r\nopened it, he found himself under the starry, moonless sky at the foot\r\nof the tower.\r\n\r\nHe soon discovered the way out of the garden, with which he had some\r\nacquaintance already, and in a few minutes was climbing the mountain\r\nwith a solemn and cheerful heart.  It was rather dark, but he knew the\r\nway well.  As he passed the rock from which the poor pigeon fell\r\nwounded with his arrow, a great joy filled his heart at the thought\r\nthat he was delivered from the blood of the little bird, and he ran the\r\nnext hundred yards at full speed up the hill. Some dark shadows passed\r\nhim: he did not even care to think what they were, but let them run.\r\nWhen he reached home, he found his father and mother waiting supper for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\nCurdie's Father and Mother\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the fathers and mothers are quick to read their children's\r\nlooks, and when Curdie entered the cottage, his parents saw at once\r\nthat something unusual had taken place.  When he said to his mother, 'I\r\nbeg your pardon for being so late,' there was something in the tone\r\nbeyond the politeness that went to her heart, for it seemed to come\r\nfrom the place where all lovely things were born before they began to\r\ngrow in this world.  When he set his father's chair to the table, an\r\nattention he had not shown him for a long time, Peter thanked him with\r\nmore gratitude than the boy had ever yet felt in all his life.  It was\r\na small thing to do for the man who had been serving him since ever he\r\nwas born, but I suspect there is nothing a man can be so grateful for\r\nas that to which he has the most right.\r\n\r\nThere was a change upon Curdie, and father and mother felt there must\r\nbe something to account for it, and therefore were pretty sure he had\r\nsomething to tell them.  For when a child's heart is all right, it is\r\nnot likely he will want to keep anything from his parents.  But the\r\nstory of the evening was too solemn for Curdie to come out with all at\r\nonce.  He must wait until they had had their porridge, and the affairs\r\nof this world were over for the day.\r\n\r\nBut when they were seated on the grassy bank of the brook that went so\r\nsweetly blundering over the great stones of its rocky channel, for the\r\nwhole meadow lay on the top of a huge rock, then he felt that the right\r\nhour had come for sharing with them the wonderful things that had come\r\nto him.  It was perhaps the loveliest of all hours in the year.  The\r\nsummer was young and soft, and this was the warmest evening they had\r\nyet had--dusky, dark even below, while above, the stars were bright and\r\nlarge and sharp in the blackest blue sky.  The night came close around\r\nthem, clasping them in one universal arm of love, and although it\r\nneither spoke nor smiled, seemed all eye and ear, seemed to see and\r\nhear and know everything they said and did.  It is a way the night has\r\nsometimes, and there is a reason for it.  The only sound was that of\r\nthe brook, for there was no wind, and no trees for it to make its music\r\nupon if there had been, for the cottage was high up on the mountain, on\r\na great shoulder of stone where trees would not grow.\r\n\r\nThere, to the accompaniment of the water, as it hurried down to the\r\nvalley and the sea, talking busily of a thousand true things which it\r\ncould not understand, Curdie told his tale, outside and in, to his\r\nfather and mother.  What a world had slipped in between the mouth of\r\nthe mine and his mother's cottage!  Neither of them said a word until\r\nhe had ended.\r\n\r\n'Now what am I to make of it, Mother? it's so strange!' he said, and\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n'It's easy enough to see what Curdie has got to make of it, isn't it,\r\nPeter?' said the good woman, turning her face toward all she could see\r\nof her husband's.\r\n\r\n'It seems so to me,' answered Peter, with a smile which only the night\r\nsaw, but his wife felt in the tone of his words.  They were the\r\nhappiest couple in that country, because they always understood each\r\nother, and that was because they always meant the same thing, and that\r\nwas because they always loved what was fair and true and right better,\r\nnot than anything else, but than everything else put together.\r\n\r\n'Then will you tell Curdie?' said she.\r\n\r\n'You can talk best, Joan,' said he.  'You tell him, and I will\r\nlisten--and learn how to say what I think,' he added.\r\n\r\n'I,' said Curdie, 'don't know what to think.'\r\n\r\n'It does not matter so much,' said his mother.  'If only you know what\r\nto make of a thing, you'll know soon enough what to think of it.  Now I\r\nneedn't tell you, surely, Curdie, what you've got to do with this?'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you mean, Mother,' answered Curdie, 'that I must do as the\r\nold lady told me?'\r\n\r\n'That is what I mean: what else could it be?  Am I not right, Peter?'\r\n\r\n'Quite right, Joan,' answered Peter, 'so far as my judgement goes. It\r\nis a very strange story, but you see the question is not about\r\nbelieving it, for Curdie knows what came to him.'\r\n\r\n'And you remember, Curdie,' said his mother, 'that when the princess\r\ntook you up that tower once before, and there talked to her\r\ngreat-great-grandmother, you came home quite angry with her, and said\r\nthere was nothing in the place but an old tub, a heap of straw--oh, I\r\nremember your inventory quite well!--an old tub, a heap of straw, a\r\nwithered apple, and a sunbeam.  According to your eyes, that was all\r\nthere was in the great, old, musty garret.  But now you have had a\r\nglimpse of the old princess herself!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Mother, I did see her--or if I didn't--' said Curdie very\r\nthoughtfully--then began again.  'The hardest thing to believe, though\r\nI saw it with my own eyes, was when the thin, filmy creature that\r\nseemed almost to float about in the moonlight like a bit of the silver\r\npaper they put over pictures, or like a handkerchief made of spider\r\nthreads, took my hand, and rose up.  She was taller and stronger than\r\nyou, Mother, ever so much!--at least, she looked so.'\r\n\r\n'And most certainly was so, Curdie, if she looked so,' said Mrs\r\nPeterson.\r\n\r\n'Well, I confess,' returned her son, 'that one thing, if there were no\r\nother, would make me doubt whether I was not dreaming, after all, wide\r\nawake though I fancied myself to be.'\r\n\r\n'Of course,' answered his mother, 'it is not for me to say whether you\r\nwere dreaming or not if you are doubtful of it yourself; but it doesn't\r\nmake me think I am dreaming when in the summer I hold in my hand the\r\nbunch of sweet peas that make my heart glad with their colour and\r\nscent, and remember the dry, withered-looking little thing I dibbled\r\ninto the hole in the same spot in the spring.  I only think how\r\nwonderful and lovely it all is.  It seems just as full of reason as it\r\nis of wonder.  How it is done I can't tell, only there it is!  And\r\nthere is this in it, too, Curdie--of which you would not be so ready to\r\nthink--that when you come home to your father and mother, and they find\r\nyou behaving more like a dear, good son than you have behaved for a\r\nlong time, they at least are not likely to think you were only\r\ndreaming.'\r\n\r\n'Still,' said Curdie, looking a little ashamed, 'I might have dreamed\r\nmy duty.'\r\n\r\n'Then dream often, my son; for there must then be more truth in your\r\ndreams than in your waking thoughts.  But however any of these things\r\nmay be, this one point remains certain: there can be no harm in doing\r\nas she told you.  And, indeed, until you are sure there is no such\r\nperson, you are bound to do it, for you promised.'\r\n\r\n'It seems to me,' said his father, 'that if a lady comes to you in a\r\ndream, Curdie, and tells you not to talk about her when you wake, the\r\nleast you can do is to hold your tongue.'\r\n\r\n'True, Father!  Yes, Mother, I'll do it,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\nThen they went to bed, and sleep, which is the night of the soul, next\r\ntook them in its arms and made them well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\nThe Miners\r\n\r\nIt much increased Curdie's feeling of the strangeness of the whole\r\naffair, that, the next morning, when they were at work in the mine, the\r\nparty of which he and his father were two, just as if they had known\r\nwhat had happened to him the night before, began talking about all\r\nmanner of wonderful tales that were abroad in the country, chiefly, of\r\ncourse, those connected with the mines, and the mountains in which they\r\nlay.  Their wives and mothers and grandmothers were their chief\r\nauthorities.  For when they sat by their firesides they heard their\r\nwives telling their children the selfsame tales, with little\r\ndifferences, and here and there one they had not heard before, which\r\nthey had heard their mothers and grandmothers tell in one or other of\r\nthe same cottages.\r\n\r\nAt length they came to speak of a certain strange being they called Old\r\nMother Wotherwop.  Some said their wives had seen her.  It appeared as\r\nthey talked that not one had seen her more than once. Some of their\r\nmothers and grandmothers, however, had seen her also, and they all had\r\ntold them tales about her when they were children. They said she could\r\ntake any shape she liked, but that in reality she was a withered old\r\nwoman, so old and so withered that she was as thin as a sieve with a\r\nlamp behind it; that she was never seen except at night, and when\r\nsomething terrible had taken place, or was going to take place--such as\r\nthe falling in of the roof of a mine, or the breaking out of water in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShe had more than once been seen--it was always at night--beside some\r\nwell, sitting on the brink of it, and leaning over and stirring it with\r\nher forefinger, which was six times as long as any of the rest.  And\r\nwhoever for months after drank of that well was sure to be ill.  To\r\nthis, one of them, however, added that he remembered his mother saying\r\nthat whoever in bad health drank of the well was sure to get better.\r\nBut the majority agreed that the former was the right version of the\r\nstory--for was she not a witch, an old hating witch, whose delight was\r\nto do mischief?  One said he had heard that she took the shape of a\r\nyoung woman sometimes, as beautiful as an angel, and then was most\r\ndangerous of all, for she struck every man who looked upon her\r\nstone-blind.\r\n\r\nPeter ventured the question whether she might not as likely be an angel\r\nthat took the form of an old woman, as an old woman that took the form\r\nof an angel.  But nobody except Curdie, who was holding his peace with\r\nall his might, saw any sense in the question.  They said an old woman\r\nmight be very glad to make herself look like a young one, but who ever\r\nheard of a young and beautiful one making herself look old and ugly?\r\n\r\nPeter asked why they were so much more ready to believe the bad that\r\nwas said of her than the good.  They answered, because she was bad.  He\r\nasked why they believed her to be bad, and they answered, because she\r\ndid bad things.  When he asked how they knew that, they said, because\r\nshe was a bad creature.  Even if they didn't know it, they said, a\r\nwoman like that was so much more likely to be bad than good.  Why did\r\nshe go about at night?  Why did she appear only now and then, and on\r\nsuch occasions?  One went on to tell how one night when his grandfather\r\nhad been having a jolly time of it with his friends in the market town,\r\nshe had served him so upon his way home that the poor man never drank a\r\ndrop of anything stronger than water after it to the day of his death.\r\nShe dragged him into a bog, and tumbled him up and down in it till he\r\nwas nearly dead.\r\n\r\n'I suppose that was her way of teaching him what a good thing water\r\nwas,' said Peter; but the man, who liked strong drink, did not see the\r\njoke.\r\n\r\n'They do say,' said another, 'that she has lived in the old house over\r\nthere ever since the little princess left it.  They say too that the\r\nhousekeeper knows all about it, and is hand and glove with the old\r\nwitch.  I don't doubt they have many a nice airing together on\r\nbroomsticks.  But I don't doubt either it's all nonsense, and there's\r\nno such person at all.'\r\n\r\n'When our cow died,' said another, 'she was seen going round and round\r\nthe cowhouse the same night.  To be sure she left a fine calf behind\r\nher--I mean the cow did, not the witch.  I wonder she didn't kill that,\r\ntoo, for she'll be a far finer cow than ever her mother was.'\r\n\r\n'My old woman came upon her one night, not long before the water broke\r\nout in the mine, sitting on a stone on the hillside with a whole\r\ncongregation of cobs about her.  When they saw my wife they all\r\nscampered off as fast as they could run, and where the witch was\r\nsitting there was nothing to be seen but a withered bracken bush.  I\r\nmade no doubt myself she was putting them up to it.'\r\n\r\nAnd so they went on with one foolish tale after another, while Peter\r\nput in a word now and then, and Curdie diligently held his peace.  But\r\nhis silence at last drew attention upon it, and one of them said:\r\n\r\n'Come, young Curdie, what are you thinking of?'\r\n\r\n'How do you know I'm thinking of anything?' asked Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Because you're not saying anything.'\r\n\r\n'Does it follow then that, as you are saying so much, you're not\r\nthinking at all?' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'I know what he's thinking,' said one who had not yet spoken; 'he's\r\nthinking what a set of fools you are to talk such rubbish; as if ever\r\nthere was or could be such an old woman as you say!  I'm sure Curdie\r\nknows better than all that comes to.'\r\n\r\n'I think,' said Curdie, 'it would be better that he who says anything\r\nabout her should be quite sure it is true, lest she should hear him,\r\nand not like to be slandered.'\r\n\r\n'But would she like it any better if it were true?' said the same man.\r\n'If she is What they say--I don't know--but I never knew a man that\r\nwouldn't go in a rage to be called the very thing he was.'\r\n\r\n'If bad things were true of her, and I knew it,' said Curdie, 'I would\r\nnot hesitate to say them, for I will never give in to being afraid of\r\nanything that's bad.  I suspect that the things they tell, however, if\r\nwe knew all about them, would turn out to have nothing but good in\r\nthem; and I won't say a word more for fear I should say something that\r\nmightn't be to her mind.'\r\n\r\nThey all burst into a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n'Hear the parson!' they cried.  'He believes in the witch!  Ha! ha!'\r\n\r\n'He's afraid of her!'\r\n\r\n'And says all she does is good!'\r\n\r\n'He wants to make friends with her, that she may help him to find the\r\nsilver ore.'\r\n\r\n'Give me my own eyes and a good divining rod before all the witches in\r\nthe world!  And so I'd advise you too, Master Curdie; that is, when\r\nyour eyes have grown to be worth anything, and you have learned to cut\r\nthe hazel fork.'\r\n\r\nThus they all mocked and jeered at him, but he did his best to keep his\r\ntemper and go quietly on with his work.  He got as close to his father\r\nas he could, however, for that helped him to bear it.  As soon as they\r\nwere tired of laughing and mocking, Curdie was friendly with them, and\r\nlong before their midday meal all between them was as it had been.\r\n\r\nBut when the evening came, Peter and Curdie felt that they would rather\r\nwalk home together without other company, and therefore lingered behind\r\nwhen the rest of the men left the mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\nThe Emerald\r\n\r\nFather and son had seated themselves on a projecting piece of rock at a\r\ncorner where three galleries met--the one they had come along from\r\ntheir work, one to the right leading out of the mountain, and the other\r\nto the left leading far into a portion of it which had been long\r\ndisused.  Since the inundation caused by the goblins, it had indeed\r\nbeen rendered impassable by the settlement of a quantity of the water,\r\nforming a small but very deep lake, in a part where there was a\r\nconsiderable descent.\r\n\r\nThey had just risen and were turning to the right, when a gleam caught\r\ntheir eyes, and made them look along the whole gallery.  Far up they\r\nsaw a pale green light, whence issuing they could not tell, about\r\nhalfway between floor and roof of the passage.  They saw nothing but\r\nthe light, which was like a large star, with a point of darker colour\r\nyet brighter radiance in the heart of it, whence the rest of the light\r\nshot out in rays that faded toward the ends until they vanished.  It\r\nshed hardly any light around it, although in itself it was so bright as\r\nto sting the eyes that beheld it. Wonderful stories had from ages gone\r\nbeen current in the mines about certain magic gems which gave out light\r\nof themselves, and this light looked just like what might be supposed\r\nto shoot from the heart of such a gem.\r\n\r\nThey went up the old gallery to find out what it could be.  To their\r\nsurprise they found, however, that, after going some distance, they\r\nwere no nearer to it, so far as they could judge, than when they\r\nstarted.  It did not seem to move, and yet they moving did not approach\r\nit.  Still they persevered, for it was far too wonderful a thing to\r\nlose sight of, so long as they could keep it.  At length they drew near\r\nthe hollow where the water lay, and still were no nearer the light.\r\nWhere they expected to be stopped by the water, however, water was\r\nnone: something had taken place in some part of the mine that had\r\ndrained it off, and the gallery lay open as in former times.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to their surprise, the light, instead of being in front of\r\nthem, was shining at the same distance to the right, where they did not\r\nknow there was any passage at all.  Then they discovered, by the light\r\nof the lanterns they carried, that there the water had broken through,\r\nand made an entrance to a part of the mountain of which Peter knew\r\nnothing.  But they were hardly well into it, still following the light,\r\nbefore Curdie thought he recognized some of the passages he had so\r\noften gone through when he was watching the goblins.\r\n\r\nAfter they had advanced a long way, with many turnings, now to the\r\nright, now to the left, all at once their eyes seemed to come suddenly\r\nto themselves, and they became aware that the light which they had\r\ntaken to be a great way from them was in reality almost within reach of\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nThe same instant it began to grow larger and thinner, the point of\r\nlight grew dim as it spread, the greenness melted away, and in a moment\r\nor two, instead of the star, a dark, dark and yet luminous face was\r\nlooking at them with living eyes.  And Curdie felt a great awe swell up\r\nin his heart, for he thought he had seen those eyes before.\r\n\r\n'I see you know me, Curdie,' said a voice.\r\n\r\n'If your eyes are you, ma'am, then I know you,' said Curdie.  'But I\r\nnever saw your face before.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you have seen it, Curdie,' said the voice.  And with that the\r\ndarkness of its complexion melted away, and down from the face dawned\r\nout the form that belonged to it, until at last Curdie and his father\r\nbeheld a lady, beautiful exceedingly, dressed in something pale green,\r\nlike velvet, over which her hair fell in cataracts of a rich golden\r\ncolour.  It looked as if it were pouring down from her head, and, like\r\nthe water of the Dustbrook, vanishing in a golden vapour ere it reached\r\nthe floor.  It came flowing from under the edge of a coronet of gold,\r\nset with alternated pearls and emeralds.  In front of the crown was a\r\ngreat emerald, which looked somehow as if out of it had come the light\r\nthey had followed. There was no ornament else about her, except on her\r\nslippers, which were one mass of gleaming emeralds, of various shades\r\nof green, all mingling lovelily like the waving of grass in the wind\r\nand sun. She looked about five-and-twenty years old.  And for all the\r\ndifference, Curdie knew somehow or other, he could not have told how,\r\nthat the face before him was that of the old princess, Irene's\r\ngreat-great-grandmother.\r\n\r\nBy this time all around them had grown light, and now first they could\r\nsee where they were.  They stood in a great splendid cavern, which\r\nCurdie recognized as that in which the goblins held their state\r\nassemblies.  But, strange to tell, the light by which they saw came\r\nstreaming, sparkling, and shooting from stones of many colours in the\r\nsides and roof and floor of the cavern--stones of all the colours of\r\nthe rainbow, and many more.  It was a glorious sight--the whole rugged\r\nplace flashing with colours--in one spot a great light of deep\r\ncarbuncular red, in another of sapphirine blue, in another of topaz\r\nyellow; while here and there were groups of stones of all hues and\r\nsizes, and again nebulous spaces of thousands of tiniest spots of\r\nbrilliancy of every conceivable shade.  Sometimes the colours ran\r\ntogether, and made a little river or lake of lambent, interfusing, and\r\nchanging tints, which, by their variegation, seemed to imitate the\r\nflowing of water, or waves made by the wind.\r\n\r\nCurdie would have gazed entranced, but that all the beauty of the\r\ncavern, yes, of all he knew of the whole creation, seemed gathered in\r\none centre of harmony and loveliness in the person of the ancient lady\r\nwho stood before him in the very summer of beauty and strength.\r\nTurning from the first glance at the circuadjacent splendour, it\r\ndwindled into nothing as he looked again at the lady. Nothing flashed\r\nor glowed or shone about her, and yet it was with a prevision of the\r\ntruth that he said,\r\n\r\n'I was here once before, ma'am.'\r\n\r\n'I know that, Curdie,' she replied.\r\n\r\n'The place was full of torches, and the walls gleamed, but nothing as\r\nthey do now, and there is no light in the place.'\r\n\r\n'You want to know where the light comes from?' she said, smiling.\r\n\r\n'Yes, ma'am.'\r\n\r\n'Then see: I will go out of the cavern.  Do not be afraid, but watch.'\r\n\r\nShe went slowly out.  The moment she turned her back to go, the light\r\nbegan to pale and fade; the moment she was out of their sight the place\r\nwas black as night, save that now the smoky yellow-red of their lamps,\r\nwhich they thought had gone out long ago, cast a dusky glimmer around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\nWhat Is in a Name?\r\n\r\nFor a time that seemed to them long, the two men stood waiting, while\r\nstill the Mother of Light did not return.  So long was she absent that\r\nthey began to grow anxious: how were they to find their way from the\r\nnatural hollows of the mountain crossed by goblin paths, if their lamps\r\nshould go out?  To spend the night there would mean to sit and wait\r\nuntil an earthquake rent the mountain, or the earth herself fell back\r\ninto the smelting furnace of the sun whence she had issued--for it was\r\nall night and no faintest dawn in the bosom of the world.\r\n\r\nSo long did they wait unrevisited, that, had there not been two of\r\nthem, either would at length have concluded the vision a home-born\r\nproduct of his own seething brain.  And their lamps were going out, for\r\nthey grew redder and smokier!  But they did not lose courage, for there\r\nis a kind of capillary attraction in the facing of two souls, that\r\nlifts faith quite beyond the level to which either could raise it\r\nalone: they knew that they had seen the lady of emeralds, and it was to\r\ngive them their own desire that she had gone from them, and neither\r\nwould yield for a moment to the half doubts and half dreads that awoke\r\nin his heart.\r\n\r\nAnd still she who with her absence darkened their air did not return.\r\nThey grew weary, and sat down on the rocky floor, for wait they\r\nwould--indeed, wait they must.  Each set his lamp by his knee, and\r\nwatched it die.  Slowly it sank, dulled, looked lazy and stupid.  But\r\never as it sank and dulled, the image in his mind of the Lady of Light\r\ngrew stronger and clearer.  Together the two lamps panted and\r\nshuddered.  First one, then the other went out, leaving for a moment a\r\ngreat, red, evil-smelling snuff.  Then all was the blackness of\r\ndarkness up to their very hearts and everywhere around them.  Was it?\r\nNo.  Far away--it looked miles away--shone one minute faint point of\r\ngreen light--where, who could tell?  They only knew that it shone.  It\r\ngrew larger, and seemed to draw nearer, until at last, as they watched\r\nwith speechless delight and expectation, it seemed once more within\r\nreach of an outstretched hand.  Then it spread and melted away as\r\nbefore, and there were eyes--and a face--and a lovely form--and lo! the\r\nwhole cavern blazing with lights innumerable, and gorgeous, yet soft\r\nand interfused--so blended, indeed, that the eye had to search and see\r\nin order to separate distinct spots of special colour.\r\n\r\nThe moment they saw the speck in the vast distance they had risen and\r\nstood on their feet.  When it came nearer they bowed their heads.  Yet\r\nnow they looked with fearless eyes, for the woman that was old yet\r\nyoung was a joy to see, and filled their hearts with reverent delight.\r\nShe turned first to Peter.\r\n\r\n'I have known you long,' she said.  'I have met you going to and from\r\nthe mine, and seen you working in it for the last forty years.'\r\n\r\n'How should it be, madam, that a grand lady like you should take notice\r\nof a poor man like me?' said Peter, humbly, but more foolishly than he\r\ncould then have understood.\r\n\r\n'I am poor as well as rich,' said she.  'I, too, work for my bread, and\r\nI show myself no favour when I pay myself my own wages.  Last night\r\nwhen you sat by the brook, and Curdie told you about my pigeon, and my\r\nspinning, and wondered whether he could believe that he had actually\r\nseen me, I heard what you said to each other.  I am always about, as\r\nthe miners said the other night when they talked of me as Old Mother\r\nWotherwop.'\r\n\r\nThe lovely lady laughed, and her laugh was a lightning of delight in\r\ntheir souls.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she went on, 'you have got to thank me that you are so poor,\r\nPeter.  I have seen to that, and it has done well for both you and me,\r\nmy friend.  Things come to the poor that can't get in at the door of\r\nthe rich.  Their money somehow blocks it up.  It is a great privilege\r\nto be poor, Peter--one that no man ever coveted, and but a very few\r\nhave sought to retain, but one that yet many have learned to prize.\r\nYou must not mistake, however, and imagine it a virtue; it is but a\r\nprivilege, and one also that, like other privileges, may be terribly\r\nmisused.  Had you been rich, my Peter, you would not have been so good\r\nas some rich men I know.  And now I am going to tell you what no one\r\nknows but myself: you, Peter, and your wife both have the blood of the\r\nroyal family in your veins.  I have been trying to cultivate your\r\nfamily tree, every branch of which is known to me, and I expect Curdie\r\nto turn out a blossom on it.  Therefore I have been training him for a\r\nwork that must soon be done.  I was near losing him, and had to send my\r\npigeon.  Had he not shot it, that would have been better; but he\r\nrepented, and that shall be as good in the end.'\r\n\r\nShe turned to Curdie and smiled.\r\n\r\n'Ma'am,' said Curdie, 'may I ask questions?'\r\n\r\n'Why not, Curdie?'\r\n\r\n'Because I have been told, ma'am, that nobody must ask the king\r\nquestions.'\r\n\r\n'The king never made that law,' she answered, with some displeasure.\r\n'You may ask me as many as you please--that is, so long as they are\r\nsensible.  Only I may take a few thousand years to answer some of them.\r\nBut that's nothing.  Of all things time is the cheapest.'\r\n\r\n'Then would you mind telling me now, ma'am, for I feel very confused\r\nabout it--are you the Lady of the Silver Moon?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Curdie; you may call me that if you like.  What it means is true.'\r\n\r\n'And now I see you dark, and clothed in green, and the mother of all\r\nthe light that dwells in the stones of the earth!  And up there they\r\ncall you Old Mother Wotherwop!  And the Princess Irene told me you were\r\nher great-great-grandmother!  And you spin the spider threads, and take\r\ncare of a whole people of pigeons; and you are worn to a pale shadow\r\nwith old age; and are as young as anybody can be, not to be too young;\r\nand as strong, I do believe, as I am.'\r\n\r\nThe lady stooped toward a large green stone bedded in the rock of the\r\nfloor, and looking like a well of grassy light in it.  She laid hold of\r\nit with her fingers, broke it out, and gave it to Peter. 'There!' cried\r\nCurdie.  'I told you so.  Twenty men could not have done that.  And\r\nyour fingers are white and smooth as any lady's in the land.  I don't\r\nknow what to make of it.'\r\n\r\n'I could give you twenty names more to call me, Curdie, and not one of\r\nthem would be a false one.  What does it matter how many names if the\r\nperson is one?'\r\n\r\n'Ah!  But it is not names only, ma'am.  Look at what you were like last\r\nnight, and what I see you now!'\r\n\r\n'Shapes are only dresses, Curdie, and dresses are only names.  That\r\nwhich is inside is the same all the time.'\r\n\r\n'But then how can all the shapes speak the truth?'\r\n\r\n'It would want thousands more to speak the truth, Curdie; and then they\r\ncould not.  But there is a point I must not let you mistake about.  It\r\nis one thing the shape I choose to put on, and quite another the shape\r\nthat foolish talk and nursery tale may please to put upon me.  Also, it\r\nis one thing what you or your father may think about me, and quite\r\nanother what a foolish or bad man may see in me.  For instance, if a\r\nthief were to come in here just now, he would think he saw the demon of\r\nthe mine, all in green flames, come to protect her treasure, and would\r\nrun like a hunted wild goat.  I should be all the same, but his evil\r\neyes would see me as I was not.'\r\n\r\n'I think I understand,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Peter,' said the lady, turning then to him, 'you will have to give up\r\nCurdie for a little while.'\r\n\r\n'So long as he loves us, ma'am, that will not matter--much.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! you are right there, my friend,' said the beautiful princess. And\r\nas she said it she put out her hand, and took the hard, horny hand of\r\nthe miner in it, and held it for a moment lovingly.\r\n\r\n'I need say no more,' she added, 'for we understand each other--you and\r\nI, Peter.'\r\n\r\nThe tears came into Peter's eyes.  He bowed his head in thankfulness,\r\nand his heart was much too full to speak.\r\n\r\nThen the great old, young, beautiful princess turned to Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Now, Curdie, are you ready?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, ma'am,' answered Curdie.\r\n\r\n'You do not know what for.'\r\n\r\n'You do, ma'am.  That is enough.'\r\n\r\n'You could not have given me a better answer, or done more to prepare\r\nyourself, Curdie,' she returned, with one of her radiant smiles.  'Do\r\nyou think you will know me again?'\r\n\r\n'I think so.  But how can I tell what you may look like next?'\r\n\r\n'Ah, that indeed!  How can you tell?  Or how could I expect you should?\r\nBut those who know me well, know me whatever new dress or shape or name\r\nI may be in; and by and by you will have learned to do so too.'\r\n\r\n'But if you want me to know you again, ma'am, for certain sure,' said\r\nCurdie, 'could you not give me some sign, or tell me something about\r\nyou that never changes--or some other way to know you, or thing to know\r\nyou by?'\r\n\r\n'No, Curdie; that would be to keep you from knowing me.  You must know\r\nme in quite another way from that.  It would not be the least use to\r\nyou or me either if I were to make you know me in that way. It would be\r\nbut to know the sign of Me--not to know me myself.  It would be no\r\nbetter than if I were to take this emerald out of my crown and give it\r\nto you to take home with you, and you were to call it me, and talk to\r\nit as if it heard and saw and loved you. Much good that would do you,\r\nCurdie!  No; you must do what you can to know me, and if you do, you\r\nwill.  You shall see me again in very different circumstances from\r\nthese, and, I will tell you so much, it may be in a very different\r\nshape.  But come now, I will lead you out of this cavern; my good Joan\r\nwill be getting too anxious about you.  One word more: you will allow\r\nthat the men knew little what they were talking about this morning,\r\nwhen they told all those tales of Old Mother Wotherwop; but did it\r\noccur to you to think how it was they fell to talking about me at all?\r\nIt was because I came to them; I was beside them all the time they were\r\ntalking about me, though they were far enough from knowing it, and had\r\nvery little besides foolishness to say.'\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she turned and led the way from the cavern, which, as if a\r\ndoor had been closed, sank into absolute blackness behind them.  And\r\nnow they saw nothing more of the lady except the green star, which\r\nagain seemed a good distance in front of them, and to which they came\r\nno nearer, although following it at a quick pace through the mountain.\r\nSuch was their confidence in her guidance, however, and so fearless\r\nwere they in consequence, that they felt their way neither with hand\r\nnor foot, but walked straight on through the pitch-dark galleries.\r\nWhen at length the night of the upper world looked in at the mouth of\r\nthe mine, the green light seemed to lose its way among the stars, and\r\nthey saw it no more.\r\n\r\nOut they came into the cool, blessed night.  It was very late, and only\r\nstarlight.  To their surprise, three paces away they saw, seated upon a\r\nstone, an old country-woman, in a cloak which they took for black.\r\nWhen they came close up to it, they saw it was red.\r\n\r\n'Good evening!' said Peter.\r\n\r\n'Good evening!' returned the old woman, in a voice as old as herself.\r\n\r\nBut Curdie took off his cap and said:\r\n\r\n'I am your servant, Princess.'\r\n\r\nThe old woman replied:\r\n\r\n'Come to me in the dove tower tomorrow night, Curdie--alone.'\r\n\r\n'I will, ma'am,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\nSo they parted, and father and son went home to wife and mother--two\r\npersons in one rich, happy woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\nCurdie's Mission\r\n\r\nThe next night Curdie went home from the mine a little earlier than\r\nusual, to make himself tidy before going to the dove tower.  The\r\nprincess had not appointed an exact time for him to be there; he would\r\ngo as near the time he had gone first as he could.  On his way to the\r\nbottom of the hill, he met his father coming up.  The sun was then\r\ndown, and the warm first of the twilight filled the evening.  He came\r\nrather wearily up the hill: the road, he thought, must have grown\r\nsteeper in parts since he was Curdie's age.  His back was to the light\r\nof the sunset, which closed him all round in a beautiful setting, and\r\nCurdie thought what a grand-looking man his father was, even when he\r\nwas tired.  It is greed and laziness and selfishness, not hunger or\r\nweariness or cold, that take the dignity out of a man, and make him\r\nlook mean.\r\n\r\n'Ah, Curdie!  There you are!' he said, seeing his son come bounding\r\nalong as if it were morning with him and not evening.\r\n\r\n'You look tired, Father,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Yes, my boy.  I'm not so young as you.'\r\n\r\n'Nor so old as the princess,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Tell me this,' said Peter, 'why do people talk about going downhill\r\nwhen they begin to get old?  It seems to me that then first they begin\r\nto go uphill.'\r\n\r\n'You looked to me, Father, when I caught sight of you, as if you had\r\nbeen climbing the hill all your life, and were soon to get to the top.'\r\n\r\n'Nobody can tell when that will be,' returned Peter.  'We're so ready\r\nto think we're just at the top when it lies miles away.  But I must not\r\nkeep you, my boy, for you are wanted; and we shall be anxious to know\r\nwhat the princess says to you--that is, if she will allow you to tell\r\nus.'\r\n\r\n'I think she will, for she knows there is nobody more to be trusted\r\nthan my father and mother,' said Curdie, with pride.\r\n\r\nAnd away he shot, and ran, and jumped, and seemed almost to fly down\r\nthe long, winding, steep path, until he came to the gate of the king's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThere he met an unexpected obstruction: in the open door stood the\r\nhousekeeper, and she seemed to broaden herself out until she almost\r\nfilled the doorway.\r\n\r\n'So!' she said, 'it's you, is it, young man?  You are the person that\r\ncomes in and goes out when he pleases, and keeps running up and down my\r\nstairs without ever saying by your leave, or even wiping his shoes, and\r\nalways leaves the door open!  Don't you know this is my house?'\r\n\r\n'No, I do not,' returned Curdie respectfully.  'You forget, ma'am, that\r\nit is the king's house.'\r\n\r\n'That is all the same.  The king left it to me to take care of--and\r\nthat you shall know!'\r\n\r\n'Is the king dead, ma'am, that he has left it to you?' asked Curdie,\r\nhalf in doubt from the self-assertion of the woman.\r\n\r\n'Insolent fellow!' exclaimed the housekeeper.  'Don't you see by my\r\ndress that I am in the king's service?'\r\n\r\n'And am I not one of his miners?'\r\n\r\n'Ah! that goes for nothing.  I am one of his household.  You are an\r\nout-of-doors labourer.  You are a nobody.  You carry a pickaxe.  I\r\ncarry the keys at my girdle.  See!'\r\n\r\n'But you must not call one a nobody to whom the king has spoken,' said\r\nCurdie.\r\n\r\n'Go along with you!' cried the housekeeper, and would have shut the\r\ndoor in his face, had she not been afraid that when she stepped back he\r\nwould step in ere she could get it in motion, for it was very heavy and\r\nalways seemed unwilling to shut.  Curdie came a pace nearer.  She\r\nlifted the great house key from her side, and threatened to strike him\r\ndown with it, calling aloud on Mar and Whelk and Plout, the menservants\r\nunder her, to come and help her. Ere one of them could answer, however,\r\nshe gave a great shriek and turned and fled, leaving the door wide open.\r\n\r\nCurdie looked behind him, and saw an animal whose gruesome oddity even\r\nhe, who knew so many of the strange creatures, two of which were never\r\nthe same, that used to live inside the mountain with their masters the\r\ngoblins, had never seen equalled.  Its eyes were flaming with anger,\r\nbut it seemed to be at the housekeeper, for it came cowering and\r\ncreeping up and laid its head on the ground at Curdie's feet.  Curdie\r\nhardly waited to look at it, however, but ran into the house, eager to\r\nget up the stairs before any of the men should come to annoy--he had no\r\nfear of their preventing him. Without halt or hindrance, though the\r\npassages were nearly dark, he reached the door of the princess's\r\nworkroom, and knocked.\r\n\r\n'Come in,' said the voice of the princess.\r\n\r\nCurdie opened the door--but, to his astonishment, saw no room there.\r\nCould he have opened a wrong door?  There was the great sky, and the\r\nstars, and beneath he could see nothing only darkness! But what was\r\nthat in the sky, straight in front of him?  A great wheel of fire,\r\nturning and turning, and flashing out blue lights!\r\n\r\n'Come in, Curdie,' said the voice again.\r\n\r\n'I would at once, ma'am,' said Curdie, 'if I were sure I was standing\r\nat your door.'\r\n\r\n'Why should you doubt it, Curdie?'\r\n\r\n'Because I see neither walls nor floor, only darkness and the great\r\nsky.'\r\n\r\n'That is all right, Curdie.  Come in.'\r\n\r\nCurdie stepped forward at once.  He was indeed, for the very crumb of a\r\nmoment, tempted to feel before him with his foot; but he saw that would\r\nbe to distrust the princess, and a greater rudeness he could not offer\r\nher.  So he stepped straight in--I will not say without a little\r\ntremble at the thought of finding no floor beneath his foot.  But that\r\nwhich had need of the floor found it, and his foot was satisfied.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was he in than he saw that the great revolving wheel in the\r\nsky was the princess's spinning wheel, near the other end of the room,\r\nturning very fast.  He could see no sky or stars any more, but the\r\nwheel was flashing out blue--oh, such lovely sky-blue light!--and\r\nbehind it of course sat the princess, but whether an old woman as thin\r\nas a skeleton leaf, or a glorious lady as young as perfection, he could\r\nnot tell for the turning and flashing of the wheel.\r\n\r\n'Listen to the wheel,' said the voice which had already grown dear to\r\nCurdie: its very tone was precious like a jewel, not as a jewel, for no\r\njewel could compare with it in preciousness.\r\n\r\nAnd Curdie listened and listened.\r\n\r\n'What is it saying?' asked the voice.\r\n\r\n'It is singing,' answered Curdie.\r\n\r\n'What is it singing?'\r\n\r\nCurdie tried to make out, but thought he could not; for no sooner had\r\nhe got hold of something than it vanished again.\r\n\r\nYet he listened, and listened, entranced with delight.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, Curdie, said the voice.\r\n\r\n'Ma'am,' said Curdie, 'I did try hard for a while, but I could not make\r\nanything of it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, you did, and you have been telling it to me!  Shall I tell you\r\nagain what I told my wheel, and my wheel told you, and you have just\r\ntold me without knowing it?'\r\n\r\n'Please, ma'am.'\r\n\r\nThen the lady began to sing, and her wheel spun an accompaniment to her\r\nsong, and the music of the wheel was like the music of an Aeolian harp\r\nblown upon by the wind that bloweth where it listeth. Oh, the sweet\r\nsounds of that spinning wheel!  Now they were gold, now silver, now\r\ngrass, now palm trees, now ancient cities, now rubies, now mountain\r\nbrooks, now peacock's feathers, now clouds, now snowdrops, and now\r\nmid-sea islands.  But for the voice that sang through it all, about\r\nthat I have no words to tell.  It would make you weep if I were able to\r\ntell you what that was like, it was so beautiful and true and lovely.\r\nBut this is something like the words of its song:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The stars are spinning their threads,\r\n  And the clouds are the dust that flies,\r\n  And the suns are weaving them up\r\n  For the time when the sleepers shall rise.\r\n\r\n  The ocean in music rolls,\r\n  And gems are turning to eyes,\r\n  And the trees are gathering souls\r\n  For the day when the sleepers shall rise.\r\n\r\n  The weepers are learning to smile,\r\n  And laughter to glean the sighs;\r\n  Burn and bury the care and guile,\r\n  For the day when the sleepers shall rise.\r\n\r\n  Oh, the dews and the moths and the daisy red,\r\n  The larks and the glimmers and flows!\r\n  The lilies and sparrows and daily bread,\r\n  And the something that nobody knows!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe princess stopped, her wheel stopped, and she laughed.  And her\r\nlaugh was sweeter than song and wheel; sweeter than running brook and\r\nsilver bell; sweeter than joy itself, for the heart of the laugh was\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n'Come now, Curdie, to this side of my wheel, and you will find me,' she\r\nsaid; and her laugh seemed sounding on still in the words, as if they\r\nwere made of breath that had laughed.\r\n\r\nCurdie obeyed, and passed the wheel, and there she stood to receive\r\nhim!--fairer than when he saw her last, a little younger still, and\r\ndressed not in green and emeralds, but in pale blue, with a coronet of\r\nsilver set with pearls, and slippers covered with opals that gleamed\r\nevery colour of the rainbow.  It was some time before Curdie could take\r\nhis eyes from the marvel of her loveliness. Fearing at last that he was\r\nrude, he turned them away; and, behold, he was in a room that was for\r\nbeauty marvellous!  The lofty ceiling was all a golden vine, Whose\r\ngreat clusters of carbuncles, rubies, and chrysoberyls hung down like\r\nthe bosses of groined arches, and in its centre hung the most glorious\r\nlamp that human eyes ever saw--the Silver Moon itself, a globe of\r\nsilver, as it seemed, with a heart of light so wondrous potent that it\r\nrendered the mass translucent, and altogether radiant.\r\n\r\nThe room was so large that, looking back, he could scarcely see the end\r\nat which he entered; but the other was only a few yards from him--and\r\nthere he saw another wonder: on a huge hearth a great fire was burning,\r\nand the fire was a huge heap of roses, and yet it was fire.  The smell\r\nof the roses filled the air, and the heat of the flames of them glowed\r\nupon his face.  He turned an inquiring look upon the lady, and saw that\r\nshe was now seated in an ancient chair, the legs of which were crusted\r\nwith gems, but the upper part like a nest of daisies and moss and green\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n'Curdie,' she said in answer to his eyes, 'you have stood more than one\r\ntrial already, and have stood them well: now I am going to put you to a\r\nharder.  Do you think you are prepared for it?'\r\n\r\n'How can I tell, ma'am,' he returned, 'seeing I do not know what it is,\r\nor what preparation it needs?  Judge me yourself, ma'am.'\r\n\r\n'It needs only trust and obedience,' answered the lady.\r\n\r\n'I dare not say anything, ma'am.  If you think me fit, command me.'\r\n\r\n'It will hurt you terribly, Curdie, but that will be all; no real hurt\r\nbut much good will come to you from it.'\r\n\r\nCurdie made no answer but stood gazing with parted lips in the lady's\r\nface.\r\n\r\n'Go and thrust both your hands into that fire,' she said quickly,\r\nalmost hurriedly.\r\n\r\nCurdie dared not stop to think.  It was much too terrible to think\r\nabout.  He rushed to the fire, and thrust both of his hands right into\r\nthe middle of the heap of flaming roses, and his arms halfway up to the\r\nelbows.  And it did hurt!  But he did not draw them back. He held the\r\npain as if it were a thing that would kill him if he let it go--as\r\nindeed it would have done.  He was in terrible fear lest it should\r\nconquer him.\r\n\r\nBut when it had risen to the pitch that he thought he could bear it no\r\nlonger, it began to fall again, and went on growing less and less until\r\nby contrast with its former severity it had become rather pleasant.  At\r\nlast it ceased altogether, and Curdie thought his hands must be burned\r\nto cinders if not ashes, for he did not feel them at all.  The princess\r\ntold him to take them out and look at them.  He did so, and found that\r\nall that was gone of them was the rough, hard skin; they were white and\r\nsmooth like the princess's.\r\n\r\n'Come to me,' she said.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed and saw, to his surprise, that her face looked as if she had\r\nbeen weeping.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Princess!  What is the matter?' he cried.  'Did I make a noise and\r\nvex you?'\r\n\r\n'No, Curdie, she answered; 'but it was very bad.'\r\n\r\n'Did you feel it too then?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I did.  But now it is over, and all is well.  Would you like\r\nto know why I made You put your hands in the fire?' Curdie looked at\r\nthem again--then said:\r\n\r\n'To take the marks of the work off them and make them fit for the\r\nking's court, I suppose.'\r\n\r\n'No, Curdie,' answered the princess, shaking her head, for she was not\r\npleased with the answer.  'It would be a poor way of making your hands\r\nfit for the king's court to take off them signs of his service.  There\r\nis a far greater difference on them than that.  Do you feel none?'\r\n\r\n'No, ma'am.'\r\n\r\n'You will, though, by and by, when the time comes.  But perhaps even\r\nthen you might not know what had been given you, therefore I will tell\r\nyou.  Have you ever heard what some philosophers say--that men were all\r\nanimals once?'\r\n\r\n'No, ma'am.'\r\n\r\n'It is of no consequence.  But there is another thing that is of the\r\ngreatest consequence--this: that all men, if they do not take care, go\r\ndown the hill to the animals' country; that many men are actually, all\r\ntheir lives, going to be beasts.  People knew it once, but it is long\r\nsince they forgot it.'\r\n\r\n'I am not surprised to hear it, ma'am, when I think of some of our\r\nminers.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!  But you must beware, Curdie, how you say of this man or that man\r\nthat he is travelling beastward.  There are not nearly so many going\r\nthat way as at first sight you might think.  When you met your father\r\non the hill tonight, you stood and spoke together on the same spot; and\r\nalthough one of you was going up and the other coming down, at a little\r\ndistance no one could have told which was bound in the one direction\r\nand which in the other.  Just so two people may be at the same spot in\r\nmanners and behaviour, and yet one may be getting better and the other\r\nworse, which is just the greatest of all differences that could\r\npossibly exist between them.'\r\n\r\n'But ma'am,' said Curdie, 'where is the good of knowing that there is\r\nsuch a difference, if you can never know where it is?'\r\n\r\n'Now, Curdie, you must mind exactly what words I use, because although\r\nthe right words cannot do exactly what I want them to do, the wrong\r\nwords will certainly do what I do not want them to do. I did not say\r\nyou can never know.  When there is a necessity for your knowing, when\r\nyou have to do important business with this or that man, there is\r\nalways a way of knowing enough to keep you from any great blunder.  And\r\nas you will have important business to do by and by, and that with\r\npeople of whom you yet know nothing, it will be necessary that you\r\nshould have some better means than usual of learning the nature of them.\r\n\r\n'Now listen.  Since it is always what they do, whether in their minds\r\nor their bodies, that makes men go down to be less than men, that is,\r\nbeasts, the change always comes first in their hands--and first of all\r\nin the inside hands, to which the outside ones are but as the gloves.\r\nThey do not know it of course; for a beast does not know that he is a\r\nbeast, and the nearer a man gets to being a beast the less he knows it.\r\nNeither can their best friends, or their worst enemies indeed, see any\r\ndifference in their hands, for they see only the living gloves of them.\r\nBut there are not a few who feel a vague something repulsive in the\r\nhand of a man who is growing a beast.\r\n\r\n'Now here is what the rose-fire has done for you: it has made your\r\nhands so knowing and wise, it has brought your real hands so near the\r\noutside of your flesh gloves, that you will henceforth be able to know\r\nat once the hand of a man who is growing into a beast; nay, more--you\r\nwill at once feel the foot of the beast he is growing, just as if there\r\nwere no glove made like a man's hand between you and it.\r\n\r\n'Hence of course it follows that you will be able often, and with\r\nfurther education in zoology, will be able always to tell, not only\r\nwhen a man is growing a beast, but what beast he is growing to, for you\r\nwill know the foot--what it is and what beast's it is. According, then,\r\nto your knowledge of that beast will be your knowledge of the man you\r\nhave to do with.  Only there is one beautiful and awful thing about it,\r\nthat if any one gifted with this perception once uses it for his own\r\nends, it is taken from him, and then, not knowing that it is gone, he\r\nis in a far worse condition than before, for he trusts to what he has\r\nnot got.'\r\n\r\n'How dreadful!' Said Curdie.  'I must mind what I am about.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, indeed, Curdie.'\r\n\r\n'But may not one sometimes make a mistake without being able to help\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.  But so long as he is not after his own ends, he will never make\r\na serious mistake.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you want me, ma'am, to warn every one whose hand tells me\r\nthat he is growing a beast--because, as you say, he does not know it\r\nhimself.'\r\n\r\nThe princess smiled.\r\n\r\n'Much good that would do, Curdie!  I don't say there are no cases in\r\nwhich it would be of use, but they are very rare and peculiar cases,\r\nand if such come you will know them.  To such a person there is in\r\ngeneral no insult like the truth.  He cannot endure it, not because he\r\nis growing a beast, but because he is ceasing to be a man.  It is the\r\ndying man in him that it makes uncomfortable, and he trots, or creeps,\r\nor swims, or flutters out of its way--calls it a foolish feeling, a\r\nwhim, an old wives' fable, a bit of priests' humbug, an effete\r\nsuperstition, and so on.'\r\n\r\n'And is there no hope for him?  Can nothing be done?  It's so awful to\r\nthink of going down, down, down like that!'\r\n\r\n'Even when it's with his own will?'\r\n\r\n'That's what seems to me to make it worst of all,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'You are right,' answered the princess, nodding her head; 'but there is\r\nthis amount of excuse to make for all such, remember--that they do not\r\nknow what or how horrid their coming fate is. Many a lady, so delicate\r\nand nice that she can bear nothing coarser than the finest linen to\r\ntouch her body, if she had a mirror that could show her the animal she\r\nis growing to, as it lies waiting within the fair skin and the fine\r\nlinen and the silk and the jewels, would receive a shock that might\r\npossibly wake her up.'\r\n\r\n'Why then, ma'am, shouldn't she have it?'\r\n\r\nThe princess held her peace.\r\n\r\n'Come here, Lina,' she said after a long pause.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere behind Curdie, crept forward the same hideous animal\r\nwhich had fawned at his feet at the door, and which, without his\r\nknowing it, had followed him every step up the dove tower.  She ran to\r\nthe princess, and lay down flat at her feet, looking up at her with an\r\nexpression so pitiful that in Curdie's heart it overcame all the\r\nludicrousness of her horrible mass of incongruities.  She had a very\r\nshort body, and very long legs made like an elephant's, so that in\r\nlying down she kneeled with both pairs.  Her tail, which dragged on the\r\nfloor behind her, was twice as long and quite as thick as her body.\r\nHer head was something between that of a polar bear and a snake.  Her\r\neyes were dark green, with a yellow light in them.  Her under teeth\r\ncame up like a fringe of icicles, only very white, outside of her upper\r\nlip.  Her throat looked as if the hair had been plucked off.  It showed\r\na skin white and smooth.\r\n\r\n'Give Curdie a paw, Lina,' said the princess.\r\n\r\nThe creature rose, and, lifting a long foreleg, held up a great doglike\r\npaw to Curdie.  He took it gently.  But what a shudder, as of terrified\r\ndelight, ran through him, when, instead of the paw of a dog, such as it\r\nseemed to his eyes, he clasped in his great mining fist the soft, neat\r\nlittle hand of a child!  He took it in both of his, and held it as if\r\nhe could not let it go.  The green eyes stared at him with their yellow\r\nlight, and the mouth was turned up toward him with its constant half\r\ngrin; but here was the child's hand!  If he could but pull the child\r\nout of the beast! His eyes sought the princess.  She was watching him\r\nwith evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n'Ma'am, here is a child's hand!' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Your gift does more for you than it promised.  It is yet better to\r\nperceive a hidden good than a hidden evil.'\r\n\r\n'But,' began Curdie.\r\n\r\n'I am not going to answer any more questions this evening,' interrupted\r\nthe princess.  'You have not half got to the bottom of the answers I\r\nhave already given you.  That paw in your hand now might almost teach\r\nyou the whole science of natural history--the heavenly sort, I mean.'\r\n\r\n'I will think,' said Curdie.  'But oh! please! one word more: may I\r\ntell my father and mother all about it?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly--though perhaps now it may be their turn to find it a little\r\ndifficult to believe that things went just as you must tell them.'\r\n\r\n'They shall see that I believe it all this time,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Tell them that tomorrow morning you must set out for the court--not\r\nlike a great man, but just as poor as you are.  They had better not\r\nspeak about it.  Tell them also that it will be a long time before they\r\nhear of you again, but they must not lose heart.  And tell your father\r\nto lay that stone I gave him at night in a safe place--not because of\r\nthe greatness of its price, although it is such an emerald as no prince\r\nhas in his crown, but because it will be a news-bearer between you and\r\nhim.  As often as he gets at all anxious about you, he must take it and\r\nlay it in the fire, and leave it there when he goes to bed.  In the\r\nmorning he must find it in the ashes, and if it be as green as ever,\r\nthen all goes well with you; if it have lost colour, things go ill with\r\nyou; but if it be very pale indeed, then you are in great danger, and\r\nhe must come to me.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, ma'am,' said Curdie.  'Please, am I to go now?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' answered the princess, and held out her hand to him.\r\n\r\nCurdie took it, trembling with joy.  It was a very beautiful hand--not\r\nsmall, very smooth, but not very soft--and just the same to his\r\nfire-taught touch that it was to his eyes.  He would have stood there\r\nall night holding it if she had not gently withdrawn it.\r\n\r\n'I will provide you a servant,' she said, 'for your journey and to wait\r\nupon you afterward.'\r\n\r\n'But where am I to go, ma'am, and what am I to do?  You have given me\r\nno message to carry, neither have you said what I am wanted for. I go\r\nwithout a notion whether I am to walk this way or that, or what I am to\r\ndo when I get I don't know where.'\r\n\r\n'Curdie!' said the princess, and there was a tone of reminder in his\r\nown name as she spoke it, 'did I not tell you to tell your father and\r\nmother that you were to set out for the court?  And you know that lies\r\nto the north.  You must learn to use far less direct directions than\r\nthat.  You must not be like a dull servant that needs to be told again\r\nand again before he will understand.  You have orders enough to start\r\nwith, and you will find, as you go on, and as you need to know, what\r\nyou have to do.  But I warn you that perhaps it will not look the least\r\nlike what you may have been fancying I should require of you.  I have\r\none idea of you and your work, and you have another.  I do not blame\r\nyou for that--you cannot help it yet; but you must be ready to let my\r\nidea, which sets you working, set your idea right.  Be true and honest\r\nand fearless, and all shall go well with you and your work, and all\r\nwith whom your work lies, and so with your parents--and me too,\r\nCurdie,' she added after a little pause.\r\n\r\nThe young miner bowed his head low, patted the strange head that lay at\r\nthe princess's feet, and turned away.  As soon as he passed the\r\nspinning wheel, which looked, in the midst of the glorious room, just\r\nlike any wheel you might find in a country cottage--old and worn and\r\ndingy and dusty--the splendour of the place vanished, and he saw but\r\nthe big bare room he seemed at first to have entered, with the\r\nmoon--the princess's moon no doubt--shining in at one of the windows\r\nupon the spinning wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\nHands\r\n\r\nCurdie went home, pondering much, and told everything to his father and\r\nmother.  As the old princess had said, it was now their turn to find\r\nwhat they heard hard to believe.  If they had not been able to trust\r\nCurdie himself, they would have refused to believe more than the half\r\nof what he reported, then they would have refused that half too, and at\r\nlast would most likely for a time have disbelieved in the very\r\nexistence of the princess, what evidence their own senses had given\r\nthem notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nFor he had nothing conclusive to show in proof of what he told them.\r\nWhen he held out his hands to them, his mother said they looked as if\r\nhe had been washing them with soft soap, only they did smell of\r\nsomething nicer than that, and she must allow it was more like roses\r\nthan anything else she knew.  His father could not see any difference\r\nupon his hands, but then it was night, he said, and their poor little\r\nlamp was not enough for his old eyes.  As to the feel of them, each of\r\nhis own hands, he said, was hard and horny enough for two, and it must\r\nbe the fault of the dullness of his own thick skin that he felt no\r\nchange on Curdie's palms.\r\n\r\n'Here, Curdie,' said his mother, 'try my hand, and see what beast's paw\r\nlies inside it.'\r\n\r\n'No, Mother,' answered Curdie, half beseeching, half indignant, 'I will\r\nnot insult my new gift by making pretence to try it.  That would be\r\nmockery.  There is no hand within yours but the hand of a true woman,\r\nmy mother.'\r\n\r\n'I should like you just to take hold of my hand though,' said his\r\nmother.  'You are my son, and may know all the bad there is in me.'\r\n\r\nThen at once Curdie took her hand in his.  And when he had it, he kept\r\nit, stroking it gently with his other hand.\r\n\r\n'Mother,' he said at length, 'your hand feels just like that of the\r\nprincess.'\r\n\r\n'What!  My horny, cracked, rheumatic old hand, with its big joints, and\r\nits short nails all worn down to the quick with hard work--like the\r\nhand of the beautiful princess!  Why, my child, you will make me fancy\r\nyour fingers have grown very dull indeed, instead of sharp and\r\ndelicate, if you talk such nonsense.  Mine is such an ugly hand I\r\nshould be ashamed to show it to any but one that loved me.  But love\r\nmakes all safe--doesn't it, Curdie?'\r\n\r\n'Well, Mother, all I can say is that I don't feel a roughness, or a\r\ncrack, or a big joint, or a short nail.  Your hand feels just and\r\nexactly, as near as I can recollect, and it's not more than two hours\r\nsince I had it in mine--well, I will say, very like indeed to that of\r\nthe old princess.'\r\n\r\n'Go away, you flatterer,' said his mother, with a smile that showed how\r\nshe prized the love that lay beneath what she took for its hyperbole.\r\nThe praise even which one cannot accept is sweet from a true mouth.\r\n'If that is all your new gift can do, it won't make a warlock of you,'\r\nshe added.\r\n\r\n'Mother, it tells me nothing but the truth,' insisted Curdie, 'however\r\nunlike the truth it may seem.  It wants no gift to tell what anybody's\r\noutside hands are like.  But by it I know your inside hands are like\r\nthe princess's.'\r\n\r\n'And I am sure the boy speaks true,' said Peter.  'He only says about\r\nyour hand what I have known ever so long about yourself, Joan.  Curdie,\r\nyour mother's foot is as pretty a foot as any lady's in the land, and\r\nwhere her hand is not so pretty it comes of killing its beauty for you\r\nand me, my boy.  And I can tell you more, Curdie.  I don't know much\r\nabout ladies and gentlemen, but I am sure your inside mother must be a\r\nlady, as her hand tells you, and I will try to say how I know it.  This\r\nis how: when I forget myself looking at her as she goes about her\r\nwork--and that happens often as I grow older--I fancy for a moment or\r\ntwo that I am a gentleman; and when I wake up from my little dream, it\r\nis only to feel the more strongly that I must do everything as a\r\ngentleman should.  I will try to tell you what I mean, Curdie.  If a\r\ngentleman--I mean a real gentleman, not a pretended one, of which sort\r\nthey say there are a many above ground--if a real gentleman were to\r\nlose all his money and come down to work in the mines to get bread for\r\nhis family--do you think, Curdie, he would work like the lazy ones?\r\nWould he try to do as little as he could for his wages?  I know the\r\nsort of the true gentleman pretty near as well as he does himself.  And\r\nmy wife, that's your mother, Curdie, she's a true lady, you may take my\r\nword for it, for it's she that makes me want to be a true gentleman.\r\nWife, the boy is in the right about your hand.'\r\n\r\n'Now, Father, let me feel yours,' said Curdie, daring a little more.\r\n\r\n'No, no, my boy,' answered Peter.  'I don't want to hear anything about\r\nmy hand or my head or my heart.  I am what I am, and I hope growing\r\nbetter, and that's enough.  No, you shan't feel my hand. You must go to\r\nbed, for you must start with the sun.'\r\n\r\nIt was not as if Curdie had been leaving them to go to prison, or to\r\nmake a fortune, and although they were sorry enough to lose him, they\r\nwere not in the least heartbroken or even troubled at his going.\r\n\r\nAs the princess had said he was to go like the poor man he was, Curdie\r\ncame down in the morning from his little loft dressed in his working\r\nclothes.  His mother, who was busy getting his breakfast for him, while\r\nhis father sat reading to her out of an old book, would have had him\r\nput on his holiday garments, which, she said, would look poor enough\r\namong the fine ladies and gentlemen he was going to.  But Curdie said\r\nhe did not know that he was going among ladies and gentlemen, and that\r\nas work was better than play, his workday clothes must on the whole be\r\nbetter than his playday Clothes; and as his father accepted the\r\nargument, his mother gave in.  When he had eaten his breakfast, she\r\ntook a pouch made of goatskin, with the long hair on it, filled it with\r\nbread and cheese, and hung it over his shoulder.  Then his father gave\r\nhim a stick he had cut for him in the wood, and he bade them good-bye\r\nrather hurriedly, for he was afraid of breaking down.  As he went out\r\nhe caught up his mattock and took it with him.  It had on the one side\r\na pointed curve of strong steel for loosening the earth and the ore,\r\nand on the other a steel hammer for breaking the stones and rocks.\r\nJust as he crossed the threshold the sun showed the first segment of\r\nhis disc above the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\nThe Heath\r\n\r\nHe had to go to the bottom of the hill to get into a country he could\r\ncross, for the mountains to the north were full of precipices, and it\r\nwould have been losing time to go that way.  Not until he had reached\r\nthe king's house was it any use to turn northwards.  Many a look did he\r\nraise, as he passed it, to the dove tower, and as long as it was in\r\nsight, but he saw nothing of the lady of the pigeons.\r\n\r\nOn and on he fared, and came in a few hours to a country where there\r\nwere no mountains more--only hills, with great stretches of desolate\r\nheath.  Here and there was a village, but that brought him little\r\npleasure, for the people were rougher and worse mannered than those in\r\nthe mountains, and as he passed through, the children came behind and\r\nmocked him.\r\n\r\n'There's a monkey running away from the mines!' they cried. Sometimes\r\ntheir parents came out and encouraged them.\r\n\r\n'He doesn't want to find gold for the king any longer--the lazybones!'\r\nthey would say.  'He'll be well taxed down here though, and he won't\r\nlike that either.'\r\n\r\nBut it was little to Curdie that men who did not know what he was about\r\nshould not approve of his proceedings.  He gave them a merry answer now\r\nand then, and held diligently on his way.  When they got so rude as\r\nnearly to make him angry, he would treat them as he used to treat the\r\ngoblins, and sing his own songs to keep out their foolish noises.  Once\r\na child fell as he turned to run away after throwing a stone at him.\r\nHe picked him up, kissed him, and carried him to his mother.  The woman\r\nhad run out in terror when she saw the strange miner about, as she\r\nthought, to take vengeance on her boy.  When he put him in her arms,\r\nshe blessed him, and Curdie went on his way rejoicing.\r\n\r\nAnd so the day went on, and the evening came, and in the middle of a\r\ngreat desolate heath he began to feel tired, and sat down under an\r\nancient hawthorn, through which every now and then a lone wind that\r\nseemed to come from nowhere and to go nowhither sighed and hissed.  It\r\nwas very old and distorted.  There was not another tree for miles all\r\naround.  It seemed to have lived so long, and to have been so torn and\r\ntossed by the tempests on that moor, that it had at last gathered a\r\nwind of its own, which got up now and then, tumbled itself about, and\r\nlay down again.\r\n\r\nCurdie had been so eager to get on that he had eaten nothing since his\r\nbreakfast.  But he had had plenty of water, for Many little streams had\r\ncrossed his path.  He now opened the wallet his mother had given him,\r\nand began to eat his supper.  The sun was setting. A few clouds had\r\ngathered about the west, but there was not a single cloud anywhere else\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nNow Curdie did not know that this was a part of the country very hard\r\nto get through.  Nobody lived there, though many had tried to build in\r\nit.  Some died very soon.  Some rushed out of it.  Those who stayed\r\nlongest went raving mad, and died a terrible death. Such as walked\r\nstraight on, and did not spend a night there, got through well and were\r\nnothing the worse.  But those who slept even a single night in it were\r\nsure to meet with something they could never forget, and which often\r\nleft a mark everybody could read. And that old hawthorn Might have been\r\nenough for a warning--it looked so like a human being dried up and\r\ndistorted with age and suffering, with cares instead of loves, and\r\nthings instead of thoughts.  Both it and the heath around it, which\r\nstretched on all sides as far as he could see, were so withered that it\r\nwas impossible to say whether they were alive or not.\r\n\r\nAnd while Curdie ate there came a change.  Clouds had gathered over his\r\nhead, and seemed drifting about in every direction, as if not\r\n'shepherded by the slow, unwilling wind,' but hunted in all directions\r\nby wolfish flaws across the plains of the sky.  The sun was going down\r\nin a storm of lurid crimson, and out of the west came a wind that felt\r\nred and hot the one moment, and cold and pale the other.  And very\r\nstrangely it sang in the dreary old hawthorn tree, and very cheerily it\r\nblew about Curdie, now making him creep close up to the tree for\r\nshelter from its shivery cold, now fan himself with his cap, it was so\r\nsultry and stifling.  It seemed to come from the deathbed of the sun,\r\ndying in fever and ague.\r\n\r\nAnd as he gazed at the sun, now on the verge of the horizon, very large\r\nand very red and very dull--for though the clouds had broken away a\r\ndusty fog was spread all over the disc--Curdie saw something strange\r\nappear against it, moving about like a fly over its burning face.  This\r\nlooked as if it were coming out of the sun's furnace heart, and was a\r\nliving creature of some kind surely; but its shape was very uncertain,\r\nbecause the dazzle of the light all around melted the outlines.\r\n\r\nIt was growing larger, it must be approaching!  It grew so rapidly that\r\nby the time the sun was half down its head reached the top of the arch,\r\nand presently nothing but its legs were to be seen, crossing and\r\nrecrossing the face of the vanishing disc.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun was down he could see nothing of it more, but in a moment\r\nhe heard its feet galloping over the dry crackling heather, and seeming\r\nto come straight for him.  He stood up, lifted his pickaxes and threw\r\nthe hammer end over his shoulder: he was going to have a fight for his\r\nlife!  And now it appeared again, vague, yet very awful, in the dim\r\ntwilight the sun had left behind.  But just before it reached him, down\r\nfrom its four long legs it dropped flat on the ground, and came\r\ncrawling towards him, wagging a huge tail as it came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\nLina\r\n\r\nIt was Lina.  All at once Curdie recognized her--the frightful creature\r\nhe had seen at the princess's.  He dropped his pickaxes and held out\r\nhis hand.  She crept nearer and nearer, and laid her chin in his palm,\r\nand he patted her ugly head.  Then she crept away behind the tree, and\r\nlay down, panting hard.\r\n\r\nCurdie did not much like the idea of her being behind him. Horrible as\r\nshe was to look at, she seemed to his mind more horrible when he was\r\nnot looking at her.  But he remembered the child's hand, and never\r\nthought of driving her away.  Now and then he gave a glance behind him,\r\nand there she lay flat, with her eyes closed and her terrible teeth\r\ngleaming between her two huge forepaws.\r\n\r\nAfter his supper and his long day's journey it was no wonder Curdie\r\nshould now be sleepy.  Since the sun set the air had been warm and\r\npleasant.  He lay down under the tree, closed his eyes, and thought to\r\nsleep.  He found himself mistaken, however.  But although he could not\r\nsleep, he was yet aware of resting delightfully.\r\n\r\nPresently he heard a sweet sound of singing somewhere, such as he had\r\nnever heard before--a singing as of curious birds far off, which drew\r\nnearer and nearer.  At length he heard their wings, and, opening his\r\neyes, saw a number of very large birds, as it seemed, alighting around\r\nhim, still singing.  It was strange to hear song from the throats of\r\nsuch big birds.\r\n\r\nAnd still singing, with large and round but not the less birdlike\r\nvoices, they began to weave a strange dance about him, moving their\r\nwings in time with their legs.  But the dance seemed somehow to be\r\ntroubled and broken, and to return upon itself in an eddy, in place of\r\nsweeping smoothly on.\r\n\r\nAnd he soon learned, in the low short growls behind him, the cause of\r\nthe imperfection: they wanted to dance all round the tree, but Lina\r\nwould not permit them to come on her side.\r\n\r\nNow curdie liked the birds, and did not altogether like Lina.  But\r\nneither, nor both together, made a reason for driving away the\r\nprincess's creature.  Doubtless she had been the goblins' creature, but\r\nthe last time he saw her was in the king's house and the dove tower,\r\nand at the old princess's feet.  So he left her to do as she would, and\r\nthe dance of the birds continued only a semicircle, troubled at the\r\nedges, and returning upon itself.\r\n\r\nBut their song and their motions, nevertheless, and the waving of their\r\nwings, began at length to make him very sleepy.  All the time he had\r\nkept doubting whether they could really be birds, and the sleepier he\r\ngot, the more he imagined them something else, but he suspected no harm.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, just as he was sinking beneath the waves of slumber, he awoke\r\nin fierce pain.  The birds were upon him--all over him--and had begun\r\nto tear him with beaks and claws.  He had but time, however, to feel\r\nthat he could not move under their weight, when they set up a hideous\r\nscreaming, and scattered like a cloud.  Lina was among them, snapping\r\nand striking with her paws, while her tail knocked them over and over.\r\nBut they flew up, gathered, and descended on her in a swarm, perching\r\nupon every part of her body, so that he could see only a huge misshapen\r\nmass, which seemed to go rolling away into the darkness.  He got up and\r\ntried to follow, but could see nothing, and after wandering about\r\nhither and thither for some time, found himself again beside the\r\nhawthorn.  He feared greatly that the birds had been too much for Lina,\r\nand had torn her to pieces.  In a little while, however, she came\r\nlimping back, and lay down in her old place.  Curdie also lay down,\r\nbut, from the pain of his wounds, there was no sleep for him.  When the\r\nlight came he found his clothes a good deal torn and his skin as well,\r\nbut gladly wondered why the wicked birds had not at once attacked his\r\neyes.  Then he turned, looking for Lina.  She rose and crept to him.\r\nBut she was in far worse plight than he--plucked and gashed and torn\r\nwith the beaks and claws of the birds, especially about the bare part\r\nof her neck, so that she was pitiful to see.  And those worst wounds\r\nshe could not reach to lick.\r\n\r\n'Poor Lina!' said Curdie, 'you got all those helping me.'\r\n\r\nShe wagged her tail, and made it clear she understood him.  Then it\r\nflashed upon Curdie's mind that perhaps this was the companion the\r\nprincess had promised him.  For the princess did so many things\r\ndifferently from what anybody looked for!  Lina was no beauty\r\ncertainly, but already, the first night, she had saved his life.\r\n\r\n'Come along, Lina,' he said, 'we want water.'\r\n\r\nShe put her nose to the earth, and after snuffing for a moment, darted\r\noff in a straight line.  Curdie followed.  The ground was so uneven,\r\nthat after losing sight of her many times, at last he seemed to have\r\nlost her altogether.  In a few minutes, however, he came upon her\r\nwaiting for him.  Instantly she darted off again. After he had lost and\r\nfound her again many times, he found her the last time lying beside a\r\ngreat stone.  As soon as he came up she began scratching at it with her\r\npaws.  When he had raised it an inch or two, she shoved in first her\r\nnose and then her teeth, and lifted with all the might of her neck.\r\n\r\nWhen at length between them they got it up, there was a beautiful\r\nlittle well.  He filled his cap with the clearest and sweetest water,\r\nand drank.  Then he gave to Lina, and she drank plentifully. Next he\r\nwashed her wounds very carefully.  And as he did so, he noted how much\r\nthe bareness of her neck added to the strange repulsiveness of her\r\nappearance.  Then he bethought him of the goatskin wallet his mother\r\nhad given him, and taking it from his shoulders, tried whether it would\r\ndo to make a collar of for the poor animal.  He found there was just\r\nenough, and the hair so similar in colour to Lina's, that no one could\r\nsuspect it of having grown somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe took his knife, ripped up the seams of the wallet, and began trying\r\nthe skin to her neck.  It was plain she understood perfectly what he\r\nwished, for she endeavoured to hold her neck conveniently, turning it\r\nthis way and that while he contrived, with his rather scanty material,\r\nto make the collar fit.  As his mother had taken care to provide him\r\nwith needles and thread, he soon had a nice gorget ready for her.  He\r\nlaced it on with one of his boot laces, which its long hair covered.\r\nPoor Lina looked much better in it. Nor could any one have called it a\r\npiece of finery.  If ever green eyes with a yellow light in them looked\r\ngrateful, hers did.\r\n\r\nAs they had no longer any bag to carry them in, Curdie and Lina now ate\r\nwhat was left of the provisions.  Then they set out again upon their\r\njourney.  For seven days it lasted.  They met with various adventures,\r\nand in all of them Lina proved so helpful, and so ready to risk her\r\nlife for the sake of her companion, that Curdie grew not merely very\r\nfond but very trustful of her; and her ugliness, which at first only\r\nmoved his pity, now actually increased his affection for her.  One day,\r\nlooking at her stretched on the grass before him, he said:\r\n\r\n'Oh, Lina!  If the princess would but burn you in her fire of roses!'\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, gave a mournful whine like a dog, and laid her\r\nhead on his feet.  What or how much he could not tell, but clearly she\r\nhad gathered something from his words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\nMore Creatures\r\n\r\nOne day from morning till night they had been passing through a forest.\r\nAs soon as the sun was down Curdie began to be aware that there were\r\nmore in it than themselves.  First he saw only the swift rush of a\r\nfigure across the trees at some distance.  Then he saw another and then\r\nanother at shorter intervals.  Then he saw others both farther off and\r\nnearer.  At last, missing Lina and looking about after her, he saw an\r\nappearance as marvellous as herself steal up to her, and begin\r\nconversing with her after some beast fashion which evidently she\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nPresently what seemed a quarrel arose between them, and stranger noises\r\nfollowed, mingled with growling.  At length it came to a fight, which\r\nhad not lasted long, however, before the creature of the wood threw\r\nitself upon its back, and held up its paws to Lina. She instantly\r\nwalked on, and the creature got up and followed her. They had not gone\r\nfar before another strange animal appeared, approaching Lina, when\r\nprecisely the same thing was repeated, the vanquished animal rising and\r\nfollowing with the former.  Again, and yet again, and again, a fresh\r\nanimal came up, seemed to be reasoned and certainly was fought with and\r\novercome by Lina, until at last, before they were out of the wood, she\r\nwas followed by forty-nine of the most grotesquely ugly, the most\r\nextravagantly abnormal animals imagination can conceive.  To describe\r\nthem were a hopeless task.\r\n\r\nI knew a boy who used to make animals out of heather roots. Wherever he\r\ncould find four legs, he was pretty sure to find a head and a tail.\r\nHis beasts were a most comic menagerie, and right fruitful of laughter.\r\nBut they were not so grotesque and extravagant as Lina and her\r\nfollowers.  One of them, for instance, was like a boa constrictor\r\nwalking on four little stumpy legs near its tail.  About the same\r\ndistance from its head were two little wings, which it was forever\r\nfluttering as if trying to fly with them.  Curdie thought it fancied it\r\ndid fly with them, when it was merely plodding on busily with its four\r\nlittle stumps.  How it managed to keep up he could not think, till once\r\nwhen he missed it from the group: the same moment he caught sight of\r\nsomething at a distance plunging at an awful serpentine rate through\r\nthe trees, and presently, from behind a huge ash, this same creature\r\nfell again into the group, quietly waddling along on its four stumps.\r\n\r\nWatching it after this, he saw that, when it was not able to keep up\r\nany longer, and they had all got a little space ahead, it shot into the\r\nwood away from the route, and made a great round, serpentine alone in\r\nhuge billows of motion, devouring the ground, undulating awfully,\r\ngalloping as if it were all legs together, and its four stumps nowhere.\r\nIn this mad fashion it shot ahead, and, a few minutes after, toddled in\r\nagain among the rest, walking peacefully and somewhat painfully on its\r\nfew fours.\r\n\r\nFrom the time it takes to describe one of them it will be readily seen\r\nthat it would hardly do to attempt a description of each of the\r\nforty-nine.  They were not a goodly company, but well worth\r\ncontemplating, nevertheless; and Curdie had been too long used to the\r\ngoblins' creatures in the mines and on the mountain, to feel the least\r\nuncomfortable at being followed by such a herd.  On the contrary, the\r\nmarvellous vagaries of shape they manifested amused him greatly, and\r\nshortened the journey much.\r\n\r\nBefore they were all gathered, however, it had got so dark that he\r\ncould see some of them only a part at a time, and every now and then,\r\nas the company wandered on, he would be startled by some extraordinary\r\nlimb or feature, undreamed of by him before, thrusting itself out of\r\nthe darkness into the range of his ken. Probably there were some of his\r\nold acquaintances among them, although such had been the conditions of\r\nsemi-darkness, in which alone he had ever seen any of them, that it was\r\nnot like he would be able to identify any of them.\r\n\r\nOn they marched solemnly, almost in silence, for either with feet or\r\nvoice the creatures seldom made any noise.  By the time they reached\r\nthe outside of the wood it was morning twilight.  Into the open trooped\r\nthe strange torrent of deformity, each one following Lina.  Suddenly\r\nshe stopped, turned towards them, and said something which they\r\nunderstood, although to Curdie's ear the sounds she made seemed to have\r\nno articulation.  Instantly they all turned, and vanished in the\r\nforest, and Lina alone came trotting lithely and clumsily after her\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13\r\n\r\nThe Baker's Wife\r\n\r\nThey were now passing through a lovely country of hill and dale and\r\nrushing stream.  The hills were abrupt, with broken chasms for\r\nwatercourses, and deep little valleys full of trees.  But now and then\r\nthey came to a larger valley, with a fine river, whose level banks and\r\nthe adjacent meadows were dotted all over with red and white kine,\r\nwhile on the fields above, that sloped a little to the foot of the\r\nhills, grew oats and barley and wheat, and on the sides of the hills\r\nthemselves vines hung and chestnuts rose.\r\n\r\nThey came at last to a broad, beautiful river, up which they must go to\r\narrive at the city of Gwyntystorm, where the king had his court.  As\r\nthey went the valley narrowed, and then the river, but still it was\r\nwide enough for large boats.  After this, while the river kept its\r\nsize, the banks narrowed, until there was only room for a road between\r\nthe river and the great Cliffs that overhung it. At last river and road\r\ntook a sudden turn, and lo! a great rock in the river, which dividing\r\nflowed around it, and on the top of the rock the city, with lofty walls\r\nand towers and battlements, and above the city the palace of the king,\r\nbuilt like a strong castle. But the fortifications had long been\r\nneglected, for the whole country was now under one king, and all men\r\nsaid there was no more need for weapons or walls.  No man pretended to\r\nlove his neighbour, but every one said he knew that peace and quiet\r\nbehaviour was the best thing for himself, and that, he said, was quite\r\nas useful, and a great deal more reasonable.  The city was prosperous\r\nand rich, and if everybody was not comfortable, everybody else said he\r\nought to be.\r\n\r\nWhen Curdie got up opposite the mighty rock, which sparkled all over\r\nwith crystals, he found a narrow bridge, defended by gates and\r\nportcullis and towers with loopholes.  But the gates stood wide open,\r\nand were dropping from their great hinges; the portcullis was eaten\r\naway with rust, and clung to the grooves evidently immovable; while the\r\nloopholed towers had neither floor nor roof, and their tops were fast\r\nfilling up their interiors.  Curdie thought it a pity, if only for\r\ntheir old story, that they should be thus neglected.  But everybody in\r\nthe city regarded these signs of decay as the best proof of the\r\nprosperity of the place.  Commerce and self-interest, they said, had\r\ngot the better of violence, and the troubles of the past were whelmed\r\nin the riches that flowed in at their open gates.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was one sect of philosophers in it which taught that it\r\nwould be better to forget all the past history of the city, were it not\r\nthat its former imperfections taught its present inhabitants how\r\nsuperior they and their times were, and enabled them to glory over\r\ntheir ancestors.  There were even certain quacks in the city who\r\nadvertised pills for enabling people to think well of themselves, and\r\nsome few bought of them, but most laughed, and said, with evident\r\ntruth, that they did not require them.  Indeed, the general theme of\r\ndiscourse when they met was, how much wiser they were than their\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\nCurdie crossed the river, and began to ascend the winding road that led\r\nup to the city.  They met a good many idlers, and all stared at them.\r\nIt was no wonder they should stare, but there was an unfriendliness in\r\ntheir looks which Curdie did not like.  No one, however, offered them\r\nany molestation: Lina did not invite liberties.  After a long ascent,\r\nthey reached the principal gate of the city and entered.\r\n\r\nThe street was very steep, ascending toward the palace, which rose in\r\ngreat strength above all the houses.  Just as they entered, a baker,\r\nwhose shop was a few doors inside the gate, came out in his white\r\napron, and ran to the shop of his friend, the barber, on the opposite\r\nside of the way.  But as he ran he stumbled and fell heavily.  Curdie\r\nhastened to help him up, and found he had bruised his forehead badly.\r\nHe swore grievously at the stone for tripping him up, declaring it was\r\nthe third time he had fallen over it within the last month; and saying\r\nwhat was the king about that he allowed such a stone to stick up\r\nforever on the main street of his royal residence of Gwyntystorm!  What\r\nwas a king for if he would not take care of his people's heads!  And he\r\nstroked his forehead tenderly.\r\n\r\n'Was it your head or your feet that ought to bear the blame of your\r\nfall?' asked Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Why, you booby of a miner!  My feet, of course,' answered the baker.\r\n\r\n'Nay, then,' said Curdie, 'the king can't be to blame.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I see!' said the baker.  'You're laying a trap for me.  Of course,\r\nif you come to that, it was my head that ought to have looked after my\r\nfeet.  But it is the king's part to look after us all, and have his\r\nstreets smooth.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't see, said Curdie, 'why the king should take care of the\r\nbaker, when the baker's head won't take care of the baker's feet.'\r\n\r\n'Who are you to make game of the king's baker?' cried the man in a rage.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of answering, Curdie went up to the bump on the street\r\nwhich had repeated itself on the baker's head, and turning the hammer\r\nend of his mattock, struck it such a blow that it flew wide in pieces.\r\nBlow after blow he struck until he had levelled it with the street.\r\n\r\nBut out flew the barber upon him in a rage. 'What do you break my\r\nwindow for, you rascal, with your pickaxe?'\r\n\r\n'I am very sorry,' said Curdie.  'It must have been a bit of stone that\r\nflew from my mattock.  I couldn't help it, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Couldn't help it!  A fine story!  What do you go breaking the rock\r\nfor--the very rock upon which the city stands?'\r\n\r\n'Look at your friend's forehead,' said Curdie.  'See what a lump he has\r\ngot on it with falling over that same stone.'\r\n\r\n'What's that to my window?' cried the barber.  'His forehead can mend\r\nitself; my poor window can't.'\r\n\r\n'But he's the king's baker,' said Curdie, more and more surprised at\r\nthe man's anger.\r\n\r\n'What's that to me?  This is a free city.  Every man here takes care of\r\nhimself, and the king takes care of us all.  I'll have the price of my\r\nwindow out of you, or the exchequer shall pay for it.'\r\n\r\nSomething caught Curdie's eye.  He stooped, picked up a piece of the\r\nstone he had just broken, and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you are going to break another of my windows with that\r\nstone!' said the barber.\r\n\r\n'Oh no,' said Curdie.  'I didn't mean to break your window, and I\r\ncertainly won't break another.'\r\n\r\n'Give me that stone,' said the barber.\r\n\r\nCurdie gave it him, and the barber threw it over the city wall.\r\n\r\n'I thought you wanted the stone,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'No, you fool!' answered the barber.  'What should I want with a stone?'\r\n\r\nCurdie stooped and picked up another.\r\n\r\n'Give me that stone,' said the barber.\r\n\r\n'No,' answered Curdie.  'You have just told me YOU don't want a stone,\r\nand I do.'\r\n\r\nThe barber took Curdie by the collar.\r\n\r\n'Come, now!  You pay me for that window.'\r\n\r\n'How much?' asked Curdie.\r\n\r\nThe barber said, 'A crown.'  But the baker, annoyed at the\r\nheartlessness of the barber, in thinking more of his broken window than\r\nthe bump on his friend's forehead, interfered.\r\n\r\n'No, no,' he said to Curdie; 'don't you pay any such sum.  A little\r\npane like that cost only a quarter.'\r\n\r\n'Well, to be certain,' said Curdie, 'I'll give a half.'  For he doubted\r\nthe baker as well as the barber.  'Perhaps one day, if he finds he has\r\nasked too much, he will bring me the difference.'\r\n\r\n'Ha! ha!' laughed the barber.  'A fool and his money are soon parted.'\r\n\r\nBut as he took the coin from Curdie's hand he grasped it in affected\r\nreconciliation and real satisfaction.  In Curdie's, his was the cold\r\nsmooth leathery palm of a monkey.  He looked up, almost expecting to\r\nsee him pop the money in his cheek; but he had not yet got so far as\r\nthat, though he was well on the road to it: then he would have no other\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n'I'm glad that stone is gone, anyhow,' said the baker.  'It was the\r\nbane of my life.  I had no idea how easy it was to remove it.  Give me\r\nyour pickaxes young miner, and I will show you how a baker can make the\r\nstones fly.'\r\n\r\nHe caught the tool out of Curdie's hand, and flew at one of the\r\nfoundation stones of the gateway.  But he jarred his arm terribly,\r\nscarcely chipped the stone, dropped the mattock with a cry of pain, and\r\nran into his own shop.  Curdie picked up his implement, and, looking\r\nafter the baker, saw bread in the window, and followed him in.  But the\r\nbaker, ashamed of himself, and thinking he was coming to laugh at him,\r\npopped out of the back door, and when Curdie entered, the baker's wife\r\ncame from the bakehouse to serve him. Curdie requested to know the\r\nprice of a certain good-sized loaf.\r\n\r\nNow the baker's wife had been watching what had passed since first her\r\nhusband ran out of the shop, and she liked the look of Curdie. Also she\r\nwas more honest than her husband.  Casting a glance to the back door,\r\nshe replied:\r\n\r\n'That is not the best bread.  I will sell you a loaf of what we bake\r\nfor ourselves.'  And when she had spoken she laid a finger on her lips.\r\n'Take care of yourself in this place, MY son,' she added.  'They do not\r\nlove strangers.  I was once a stranger here, and I know what I say.'\r\nThen fancying she heard her husband, 'That is a strange animal you\r\nhave,' she said, in a louder voice.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' answered Curdie.  'She is no beauty, but she is very good, and\r\nwe love each other.  Don't we, Lina?'\r\n\r\nLina looked up and whined.  Curdie threw her the half of his loaf,\r\nwhich she ate, while her master and the baker's wife talked a little.\r\nThen the baker's wife gave them some water, and Curdie having paid for\r\nhis loaf, he and Lina went up the street together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14\r\n\r\nThe Dogs of Gwyntystorm\r\n\r\nThe steep street led them straight up to a large market place with\r\nbutchers' shops, about which were many dogs.  The moment they caught\r\nsight of Lina, one and all they came rushing down upon her, giving her\r\nno chance of explaining herself.  When Curdie saw the dogs coming he\r\nheaved up his mattock over his shoulder, and was ready, if they would\r\nhave it so.  Seeing him thus prepared to defend his follower, a great\r\nugly bulldog flew at him.  With the first blow Curdie struck him\r\nthrough the brain and the brute fell dead at his feet.  But he could\r\nnot at once recover his weapon, which stuck in the skull of his foe,\r\nand a huge mastiff, seeing him thus hampered, flew at him next.\r\n\r\nNow Lina, who had shown herself so brave upon the road thither, had\r\ngrown shy upon entering the city, and kept always at Curdie's heel. But\r\nit was her turn now.  The moment she saw her master in danger she\r\nseemed to go mad with rage.  As the mastiff jumped at Curdie's throat,\r\nLina flew at him, seized him with her tremendous jaws, gave one roaring\r\ngrind, and he lay beside the bulldog with his neck broken.  They were\r\nthe best dogs in the market, after the judgement of the butchers of\r\nGwyntystorm.  Down came their masters, knives in hand.\r\n\r\nCurdie drew himself up fearlessly, mattock on shoulder, and awaited\r\ntheir coming, while at his heel his awful attendant showed not only her\r\noutside fringe of icicle teeth, but a double row of right serviceable\r\nfangs she wore inside her mouth, and her green eyes flashed yellow as\r\ngold.  The butchers, not liking the look of either of them or of the\r\ndogs at their feet, drew back, and began to remonstrate in the manner\r\nof outraged men.\r\n\r\n'Stranger,' said the first, 'that bulldog is mine.'\r\n\r\n'Take him, then,' said Curdie, indignant.\r\n\r\n'You've killed him!'\r\n\r\n'Yes--else he would have killed me.'\r\n\r\n'That's no business of mine.'\r\n\r\n'No?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'That makes it the more mine, then.'\r\n\r\n'This sort of thing won't do, you know,' said the other butcher.\r\n\r\n'That's true,' said Curdie. 'That's my mastiff,' said the butcher.\r\n\r\n'And as he ought to be,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Your brute shall be burned alive for it,' said the butcher.\r\n\r\n'Not yet,' answered Curdie.  'We have done no wrong.  We were walking\r\nquietly up your street when your dogs flew at us.  If you don't teach\r\nyour dogs how to treat strangers, you must take the consequences.'\r\n\r\n'They treat them quite properly,' said the butcher.  'What right has\r\nany one to bring an abomination like that into our city?  The horror is\r\nenough to make an idiot of every child in the place.'\r\n\r\n'We are both subjects of the king, and my poor animal can't help her\r\nlooks.  How would you like to be served like that because you were\r\nugly?  She's not a bit fonder of her looks than you are--only what can\r\nshe do to change them?'\r\n\r\n'I'll do to change them,' said the fellow.\r\n\r\nThereupon the butchers brandished their long knives and advanced,\r\nkeeping their eyes upon Lina.\r\n\r\n'Don't be afraid, Lina,' cried Curdie.  'I'll kill one--you kill the\r\nother.'\r\n\r\nLina gave a howl that might have terrified an army, and crouched ready\r\nto spring.  The butchers turned and ran.\r\n\r\nBy this time a great crowd had gathered behind the butchers, and in it\r\na number of boys returning from school who began to stone the\r\nstrangers.  It was a way they had with man or beast they did not expect\r\nto make anything by.  One of the stones struck Lina; she caught it in\r\nher teeth and crunched it so that it fell in gravel from her mouth.\r\nSome of the foremost of the crowd saw this, and it terrified them.\r\nThey drew back; the rest took fright from their retreat; the panic\r\nspread; and at last the crowd scattered in all directions.  They ran,\r\nand cried out, and said the devil and his dam were come to Gwyntystorm.\r\nSo Curdie and Lina were left standing unmolested in the market place.\r\nBut the terror of them spread throughout the city, and everybody began\r\nto shut and lock his door so that by the time the setting sun shone\r\ndown the street, there was not a shop left open, for fear of the devil\r\nand his horrible dam.  But all the upper windows within sight of them\r\nwere crowded with heads watching them where they stood lonely in the\r\ndeserted market place.\r\n\r\nCurdie looked carefully all round, but could not see one open door. He\r\ncaught sight of the sign of an inn, however, and laying down his\r\nmattock, and telling Lina to take care of it, walked up to the door of\r\nit and knocked.  But the people in the house, instead of opening the\r\ndoor, threw things at him from the windows.  They would not listen to a\r\nword he said, but sent him back to Lina with the blood running down his\r\nface.  When Lina saw that she leaped up in a fury and was rushing at\r\nthe house, into which she would certainly have broken; but Curdie\r\ncalled her, and made her lie down beside him while he bethought him\r\nwhat next he should do.\r\n\r\n'Lina,' he said, 'the people keep their gates open, but their houses\r\nand their hearts shut.'\r\n\r\nAs if she knew it was her presence that had brought this trouble upon\r\nhim, she rose and went round and round him, purring like a tigress, and\r\nrubbing herself against his legs.\r\n\r\nNow there was one little thatched house that stood squeezed in between\r\ntwo tall gables, and the sides of the two great houses shot out\r\nprojecting windows that nearly met across the roof of the little one,\r\nso that it lay in the street like a doll's house.  In this house lived\r\na poor old woman, with a grandchild.  And because she never gossiped or\r\nquarrelled, or chaffered in the market, but went without what she could\r\nnot afford, the people called her a witch, and would have done her many\r\nan ill turn if they had not been afraid of her.\r\n\r\nNow while Curdie was looking in another direction the door opened, and\r\nout came a little dark-haired, black-eyed, gypsy-looking child, and\r\ntoddled across the market place toward the outcasts.  The moment they\r\nsaw her coming, Lina lay down flat on the road, and with her two huge\r\nforepaws covered her mouth, while Curdie went to meet her, holding out\r\nhis arms.  The little one came straight to him, and held up her mouth\r\nto be kissed.  Then she took him by the hand, and drew him toward the\r\nhouse, and Curdie yielded to the silent invitation.\r\n\r\nBut when Lina rose to follow, the child shrank from her, frightened a\r\nlittle.  Curdie took her up, and holding her on one arm, patted Lina\r\nwith the other hand.  Then the child wanted also to pat doggy, as she\r\ncalled her by a right bountiful stretch of courtesy, and having once\r\npatted her, nothing would serve but Curdie must let her have a ride on\r\ndoggy.  So he set her on Lina's back, holding her hand, and she rode\r\nhome in merry triumph, all unconscious of the hundreds of eyes staring\r\nat her foolhardiness from the windows about the market place, or the\r\nmurmur of deep disapproval that rose from as many lips.\r\n\r\nAt the door stood the grandmother to receive them.  She caught the\r\nchild to her bosom with delight at her courage, welcomed Curdie, and\r\nshowed no dread of Lina.  Many were the significant nods exchanged, and\r\nmany a one said to another that the devil and the witch were old\r\nfriends.  But the woman was only a wise woman, who, having seen how\r\nCurdie and Lina behaved to each other, judged from that what sort they\r\nwere, and so made them welcome to her house. She was not like her\r\nfellow townspeople, for that they were strangers recommended them to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe moment her door was shut the other doors began to open, and soon\r\nthere appeared little groups here and there about a threshold, while a\r\nfew of the more courageous ventured out upon the square--all ready to\r\nmake for their houses again, however, upon the least sign of movement\r\nin the little thatched one.\r\n\r\nThe baker and the barber had joined one of these groups, and were\r\nbusily wagging their tongues against Curdie and his horrible beast.\r\n\r\n'He can't be honest,' said the barber; 'for he paid me double the worth\r\nof the pane he broke in my window.'\r\n\r\nAnd then he told them how Curdie broke his window by breaking a stone\r\nin the street with his hammer.  There the baker struck in.\r\n\r\n'Now that was the stone,' said he, 'over which I had fallen three times\r\nwithin the last month: could it be by fair means he broke that to\r\npieces at the first blow?  Just to make up my mind on that point I\r\ntried his own hammer against a stone in the gate; it nearly broke both\r\nmy arms, and loosened half the teeth in my head!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15\r\n\r\nDerba and Barbara\r\n\r\nMeantime the wanderers were hospitably entertained by the old woman and\r\nher grandchild and they were all very comfortable and happy together.\r\nLittle Barbara sat upon Curdie's knee, and he told her stories about\r\nthe mines and his adventures in them.  But he never mentioned the king\r\nor the princess, for all that story was hard to believe.  And he told\r\nher about his mother and father, and how good they were.  And Derba sat\r\nand listened.  At last little Barbara fell asleep in Curdie's arms, and\r\nher grandmother carried her to bed.\r\n\r\nIt was a poor little house, and Derba gave up her own room to Curdie\r\nbecause he was honest and talked wisely.  Curdie saw how it was, and\r\nbegged her to allow him to lie on the floor, but she would not hear of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the night he was waked by Lina pulling at him.  As soon as he spoke\r\nto her she ceased, and Curdie, listening, thought he heard someone\r\ntrying to get in.  He rose, took his mattock, and went about the house,\r\nlistening and watching; but although he heard noises now at one place\r\nnow at another, he could not think what they meant for no one appeared.\r\nCertainly, considering how she had frightened them all in the day, it\r\nwas not likely any one would attack Lina at night.  By and by the\r\nnoises ceased, and Curdie went back to his bed, and slept undisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, however, Derba came to him in great agitation, and said\r\nthey had fastened up the door, so that she could not get out. Curdie\r\nrose immediately and went with her: they found that not only the door,\r\nbut every window in the house was so secured on the outside that it was\r\nimpossible to open one of them without using great force.  Poor Derba\r\nlooked anxiously in Curdie's face.  He broke out laughing.\r\n\r\n'They are much mistaken,' he said, 'if they fancy they could keep Lina\r\nand a miner in any house in Gwyntystorm--even if they built up doors\r\nand windows.'\r\n\r\nWith that he shouldered his mattock.  But Derba begged him not to make\r\na hole in her house just yet.  She had plenty for breakfast, she said,\r\nand before it was time for dinner they would know what the people meant\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed they did.  For within an hour appeared one of the chief\r\nmagistrates of the city, accompanied by a score of soldiers with drawn\r\nswords, and followed by a great multitude of people, requiring the\r\nminer and his brute to yield themselves, the one that he might be tried\r\nfor the disturbance he had occasioned and the injury he had committed,\r\nthe other that she might be roasted alive for her part in killing two\r\nvaluable and harmless animals belonging to worthy citizens.  The\r\nsummons was preceded and followed by flourish of trumpet, and was read\r\nwith every formality by the city marshal himself.\r\n\r\nThe moment he ended, Lina ran into the little passage, and stood\r\nopposite the door.\r\n\r\n'I surrender,' cried Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Then tie up your brute, and give her here.'\r\n\r\n'No, no,' cried Curdie through the door.  'I surrender; but I'm not\r\ngoing to do your hangman's work.  If you want MY dog, you must take\r\nher.'\r\n\r\n'Then we shall set the house on fire, and burn witch and all.'\r\n\r\n'It will go hard with us but we shall kill a few dozen of you first,'\r\ncried Curdie.  'We're not the least afraid of you.'  With that Curdie\r\nturned to Derba, and said:\r\n\r\n'Don't be frightened.  I have a strong feeling that all will be well.\r\nSurely no trouble will come to you for being good to strangers.'\r\n\r\n'But the poor dog!' said Derba.\r\n\r\nNow Curdie and Lina understood each other more than a little by this\r\ntime, and not only had he seen that she understood the proclamation,\r\nbut when she looked up at him after it was read, it was with such a\r\ngrin, and such a yellow flash, that he saw also she was determined to\r\ntake care of herself.\r\n\r\n'The dog will probably give you reason to think a little more of her\r\nere long,' he answered.  'But now,' he went on, 'I fear I must hurt\r\nyour house a little.  I have great confidence, however, that I shall be\r\nable to make up to you for it one day.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind the house, if only you can get safe off,' she answered. 'I\r\ndon't think they will hurt this precious lamb,' she added, clasping\r\nlittle Barbara to her bosom.  'For myself, it is all one; I am ready\r\nfor anything.'\r\n\r\n'It is but a little hole for Lina I want to make,' said Curdie. 'She\r\ncan creep through a much smaller one than you would think.'\r\n\r\nAgain he took his mattock, and went to the back wall.\r\n\r\n'They won't burn the house,' he said to himself.  'There is too good a\r\none on each side of it.'\r\n\r\nThe tumult had kept increasing every moment, and the city marshal had\r\nbeen shouting, but Curdie had not listened to him.  When now they heard\r\nthe blows of his mattock, there went up a great cry, and the people\r\ntaunted the soldiers that they were afraid of a dog and his miner.  The\r\nsoldiers therefore made a rush at the door, and cut its fastenings.\r\n\r\nThe moment they opened it, out leaped Lina, with a roar so unnaturally\r\nhorrible that the sword arms of the soldiers dropped by their sides,\r\nparalysed with the terror of that cry; the crowd fled in every\r\ndirection, shrieking and yelling with mortal dismay; and without even\r\nknocking down with her tail, not to say biting a man of them with her\r\npulverizing jaws, Lina vanished--no one knew whither, for not one of\r\nthe crowd had had courage to look upon her.\r\n\r\nThe moment she was gone, Curdie advanced and gave himself up.  The\r\nsoldiers were so filled with fear, shame, and chagrin, that they were\r\nready to kill him on the spot.  But he stood quietly facing them, with\r\nhis mattock on his shoulder; and the magistrate wishing to examine him,\r\nand the people to see him made an example of, the soldiers had to\r\ncontent themselves with taking him.  Partly for derision, partly to\r\nhurt him, they laid his mattock against his back, and tied his arms to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThey led him up a very steep street, and up another still, all the\r\ncrowd following.  The king's palace-castle rose towering above them;\r\nbut they stopped before they reached it, at a low-browed door in a\r\ngreat, dull, heavy-looking building.\r\n\r\nThe city marshal opened it with a key which hung at his girdle, and\r\nordered Curdie to enter.  The place within was dark as night, and while\r\nhe was feeling his way with his feet, the marshal gave him a rough\r\npush.  He fell, and rolled once or twice over, unable to help himself\r\nbecause his hands were tied behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour of the magistrate's second and more important\r\nbreakfast, and until that was over he never found himself capable of\r\nattending to a case with concentration sufficient to the distinguishing\r\nof the side upon which his own advantage lay; and hence was this\r\nrespite for Curdie, with time to collect his thoughts.  But indeed he\r\nhad very few to collect, for all he had to do, so far as he could see,\r\nwas to wait for what would come next. Neither had he much power to\r\ncollect them, for he was a good deal shaken.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he discovered, to his great relief, that, from the\r\nprojection of the pick end of his mattock beyond his body, the fall had\r\nloosened the ropes tied round it.  He got one hand disengaged, and then\r\nthe other; and presently stood free, with his good mattock once more in\r\nright serviceable relation to his arms and legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16\r\n\r\nThe Mattock\r\n\r\nWhile The magistrate reinvigorated his selfishness with a greedy\r\nbreakfast, Curdie found doing nothing in the dark rather tiresome work.\r\nIt was useless attempting to think what he should do next, seeing the\r\ncircumstances in which he was presently to find himself were altogether\r\nunknown to him.  So he began to think about his father and mother in\r\ntheir little cottage home, high in the clear air of the open\r\nMountainside, and the thought, instead of making his dungeon gloomier\r\nby the contrast, made a light in his soul that destroyed the power of\r\ndarkness and captivity.\r\n\r\nBut he was at length startled from his waking dream by a swell in the\r\nnoise outside.  All the time there had been a few of the more idle of\r\nthe inhabitants about the door, but they had been rather quiet.  Now,\r\nhowever, the sounds of feet and voices began to grow, and grew so\r\nrapidly that it was plain a multitude was gathering. For the people of\r\nGwyntystorm always gave themselves an hour of pleasure after their\r\nsecond breakfast, and what greater pleasure could they have than to see\r\na stranger abused by the officers of justice?\r\n\r\nThe noise grew till it was like the roaring of the sea, and that\r\nroaring went on a long time, for the magistrate, being a great man,\r\nliked to know that he was waited for: it added to the enjoyment of his\r\nbreakfast, and, indeed, enabled him to eat a little more after he had\r\nthought his powers exhausted.\r\n\r\nBut at length, in the waves of the human noises rose a bigger wave, and\r\nby the running and shouting and outcry, Curdie learned that the\r\nmagistrate was approaching.\r\n\r\nPresently came the sound of the great rusty key in the lock, which\r\nyielded with groaning reluctance; the door was thrown back, the light\r\nrushed in, and with it came the voice of the city marshal, calling upon\r\nCurdie, by many legal epithets opprobrious, to come forth and be tried\r\nfor his life, inasmuch as he had raised a tumult in His Majesty's city\r\nof Gwyntystorm, troubled the hearts of the king's baker and barber, and\r\nslain the faithful dogs of His Majesty's well-beloved butchers.\r\n\r\nHe was still reading, and Curdie was still seated in the brown twilight\r\nof the vault, not listening, but pondering with himself how this king\r\nthe city marshal talked of could be the same with the Majesty he had\r\nseen ride away on his grand white horse with the Princess Irene on a\r\ncushion before him, when a scream of agonized terror arose on the\r\nfarthest skirt of the crowd, and, swifter than flood or flame, the\r\nhorror spread shrieking.  In a moment the air was filled with hideous\r\nhowling, cries of unspeakable dismay, and the multitudinous noise of\r\nrunning feet.  The next moment, in at the door of the vault bounded\r\nLina, her two green eyes flaming yellow as sunflowers, and seeming to\r\nlight up the dungeon.  With one spring she threw herself at Curdie's\r\nfeet, and laid her head upon them panting.  Then came a rush of two or\r\nthree soldiers darkening the doorway, but it was only to lay hold of\r\nthe key, pull the door to, and lock it; so that once more Curdie and\r\nLina were prisoners together.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Lina lay panting hard: it is breathless work leaping\r\nand roaring both at once, and that in a way to scatter thousands of\r\npeople.  Then she jumped up, and began snuffing about all over the\r\nplace; and Curdie saw what he had never seen before--two faint spots of\r\nlight cast from her eyes upon the ground, one on each side of her\r\nsnuffing nose.  He got out his tinder box--a miner is never without\r\none--and lighted a precious bit of candle he carried in a division of\r\nit just for a moment, for he must not waste it.\r\n\r\nThe light revealed a vault without any window or other opening than the\r\ndoor.  It was very old and much neglected.  The mortar had vanished\r\nfrom between the stones, and it was half filled with a heap of all\r\nsorts of rubbish, beaten down in the middle, but looser at the sides;\r\nit sloped from the door to the foot of the opposite wall: evidently for\r\na long time the vault had been left open, and every sort of refuse\r\nthrown into it.  A single minute served for the survey, so little was\r\nthere to note.\r\n\r\nMeantime, down in the angle between the back wall and the base of the\r\nheap Lina was scratching furiously with all the eighteen great strong\r\nclaws of her mighty feet.\r\n\r\n'Ah, ha!' said Curdie to himself, catching sight of her, 'if only they\r\nwill leave us long enough to ourselves!'\r\n\r\nWith that he ran to the door, to see if there was any fastening on the\r\ninside.  There was none: in all its long history it never had had one.\r\nBut a few blows of the right sort, now from the one, now from the other\r\nend of his mattock, were as good as any bolt, for they so ruined the\r\nlock that no key could ever turn in it again. Those who heard them\r\nfancied he was trying to get out, and laughed spitefully.  As soon as\r\nhe had done, he extinguished his candle, and went down to Lina.\r\n\r\nShe had reached the hard rock which formed the floor of the dungeon,\r\nand was now clearing away the earth a little wider. Presently she\r\nlooked up in his face and whined, as much as to say, 'My paws are not\r\nhard enough to get any farther.'\r\n\r\n'Then get out of my way, Lina,' said Curdie, and mind you keep your\r\neyes shining, for fear I should hit you.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he heaved his mattock, and assailed with the hammer end of\r\nit the spot she had cleared.\r\n\r\nThe rock was very hard, but when it did break it broke in good-sized\r\npieces.  Now with hammer, now with pick, he worked till he was weary,\r\nthen rested, and then set to again.  He could not tell how the day\r\nwent, as he had no light but the lamping of Lina's eyes.  The darkness\r\nhampered him greatly, for he would not let Lina come close enough to\r\ngive him all the light she could, lest he should strike her.  So he\r\nhad, every now and then, to feel with his hands to know how he was\r\ngetting on, and to discover in what direction to strike: the exact spot\r\nwas a mere imagination.\r\n\r\nHe was getting very tired and hungry, and beginning to lose heart a\r\nlittle, when out of the ground, as if he had struck a spring of it,\r\nburst a dull, gleamy, lead-coloured light, and the next moment he heard\r\na hollow splash and echo.  A piece of rock had fallen out of the floor,\r\nand dropped into water beneath.  Already Lina, who had been lying a few\r\nyards off all the time he worked, was on her feet and peering through\r\nthe hole.  Curdie got down on his hands and knees, and looked.  They\r\nwere over what seemed a natural cave in the rock, to which apparently\r\nthe river had access, for, at a great distance below, a faint light was\r\ngleaming upon water.  If they could but reach it, they might get out;\r\nbut even if it was deep enough, the height was very dangerous.  The\r\nfirst thing, whatever might follow, was to make the hole larger.  It\r\nwas comparatively easy to break away the sides of it, and in the course\r\nof another hour he had it large enough to get through.\r\n\r\nAnd now he must reconnoitre.  He took the rope they had tied him\r\nwith--for Curdie's hindrances were always his furtherance--and fastened\r\none end of it by a slipknot round the handle of his pickaxes then\r\ndropped the other end through, and laid the pickaxe so that, when he\r\nwas through himself, and hanging on the edge, he could place it across\r\nthe hole to support him on the rope.  This done, he took the rope in\r\nhis hands, and, beginning to descend, found himself in a narrow cleft\r\nwidening into a cave.  His rope was not very long, and would not do\r\nmuch to lessen the force of his fall--he thought to himself--if he\r\nshould have to drop into the water; but he was not more than a couple\r\nof yards below the dungeon when he spied an opening on the opposite\r\nside of the cleft: it might be but a shadow hole, or it might lead them\r\nout.  He dropped himself a little below its level, gave the rope a\r\nswing by pushing his feet against the side of the cleft, and so\r\npenduled himself into it.  Then he laid a stone on the end of the rope\r\nthat it should not forsake him, called to Lina, whose yellow eyes were\r\ngleaming over the mattock grating above, to watch there till he\r\nreturned, and went cautiously in.  It proved a passage, level for some\r\ndistance, then sloping gently up.  He advanced carefully, feeling his\r\nway as he went.  At length he was stopped by a door--a small door,\r\nstudded with iron.  But the wood was in places so much decayed that\r\nsome of the bolts had dropped out, and he felt sure of being able to\r\nopen it.  He returned, therefore, to fetch Lina and his mattock.\r\nArrived at the cleft, his strong miner arms bore him swiftly up along\r\nthe rope and through the hole into the dungeon.  There he undid the\r\nrope from his mattock, and making Lina take the end of it in her teeth,\r\nand get through the hole, he lowered her--it was all he could do, she\r\nwas so heavy.  When she came opposite the passage, with a slight push\r\nof her tail she shot herself into it, and let go the rope, which Curdie\r\ndrew up.\r\n\r\nThen he lighted his candle and searching in the rubbish found a bit of\r\niron to take the place of his pickaxe across the hole.  Then he\r\nsearched again in the rubbish, and found half an old shutter.  This he\r\npropped up leaning a little over the hole, with a bit of stick, and\r\nheaped against the back of it a quantity of the loosened earth. Next he\r\ntied his mattock to the end of the rope, dropped it, and let it hang.\r\nLast, he got through the hole himself, and pulled away the propping\r\nstick, so that the shutter fell over the hole with a quantity of earth\r\non the top of it.  A few motions of hand over hand, and he swung\r\nhimself and his mattock into the passage beside Lina.\r\n\r\nThere he secured the end of the rope, and they went on together to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17\r\n\r\nThe Wine Cellar\r\n\r\nHe lighted his candle and examined it.  Decayed and broken as it was,\r\nit was strongly secured in its place by hinges on the one side, and\r\neither lock or bolt, he could not tell which, on the other.  A brief\r\nuse of his pocket-knife was enough to make room for his hand and arm to\r\nget through, and then he found a great iron bolt--but so rusty that he\r\ncould not move it.\r\n\r\nLina whimpered.  He took his knife again, made the hole bigger, and\r\nstood back.  In she shot her small head and long neck, seized the bolt\r\nwith her teeth, and dragged it, grating and complaining, back. A push\r\nthen opened the door.  It was at the foot of a short flight of steps.\r\nThey ascended, and at the top Curdie found himself in a space which,\r\nfrom the echo to his stamp, appeared of some size, though of what sort\r\nhe could not at first tell, for his hands, feeling about, came upon\r\nnothing.  Presently, however, they fell on a great thing: it was a wine\r\ncask.\r\n\r\nHe was just setting out to explore the place thoroughly, when he heard\r\nsteps coming down a stair.  He stood still, not knowing whether the\r\ndoor would open an inch from his nose or twenty yards behind his back.\r\nIt did neither.  He heard the key turn in the lock, and a stream of\r\nlight shot in, ruining the darkness, about fifteen yards away on his\r\nright.\r\n\r\nA man carrying a candle in one hand and a large silver flagon in the\r\nother, entered, and came toward him.  The light revealed a row of huge\r\nwine casks, that stretched away into the darkness of the other end of\r\nthe long vault.  Curdie retreated into the recess of the stair, and\r\npeeping round the corner of it, watched him, thinking what he could do\r\nto prevent him from locking them in.  He came on and on, until curdie\r\nfeared he would pass the recess and see them.  He was just preparing to\r\nrush out, and master him before he should give alarm, not in the least\r\nknowing what he should do next, when, to his relief, the man stopped at\r\nthe third cask from where he stood.  He set down his light on the top\r\nof it, removed what seemed a large vent-peg, and poured into the cask a\r\nquantity of something from the flagon.  Then he turned to the next\r\ncask, drew some wine, rinsed the flagon, threw the wine away, drew and\r\nrinsed and threw away again, then drew and drank, draining to the\r\nbottom.  Last of all, he filled the flagon from the cask he had first\r\nvisited, replaced then the vent-peg, took up his candle, and turned\r\ntoward the door.\r\n\r\n'There is something wrong here!' thought Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Speak to him, Lina,' he whispered.\r\n\r\nThe sudden howl she gave made Curdie himself start and tremble for a\r\nmoment.  As to the man, he answered Lina's with another horrible howl,\r\nforced from him by the convulsive shudder of every muscle of his body,\r\nthen reeled gasping to and fro, and dropped his candle. But just as\r\nCurdie expected to see him fall dead he recovered himself, and flew to\r\nthe door, through which he darted, leaving it open behind him.  The\r\nmoment he ran, Curdie stepped out, picked up the candle still alight,\r\nsped after him to the door, drew out the key, and then returned to the\r\nstair and waited.  In a few minutes he heard the sound of many feet and\r\nvoices.  Instantly he turned the tap of the cask from which the man had\r\nbeen drinking, set the candle beside it on the floor, went down the\r\nsteps and out of the little door, followed by Lina, and closed it\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nThrough the hole in it he could see a little, and hear all.  He could\r\nsee how the light of many candles filled the place, and could hear how\r\nsome two dozen feet ran hither and thither through the echoing cellar;\r\nhe could hear the clash of iron, probably spits and pokers, now and\r\nthen; and at last heard how, finding nothing remarkable except the best\r\nwine running to waste, they all turned on the butler and accused him of\r\nhaving fooled them with a drunken dream.  He did his best to defend\r\nhimself, appealing to the evidence of their own senses that he was as\r\nsober as they were. They replied that a fright was no less a fright\r\nthat the cause was imaginary, and a dream no less a dream that the\r\nfright had waked him from it.\r\n\r\nWhen he discovered, and triumphantly adduced as corroboration, that the\r\nkey was gone from the door, they said it merely showed how drunk he had\r\nbeen--either that or how frightened, for he had certainly dropped it.\r\nIn vain he protested that he had never taken it out of the lock--that\r\nhe never did when he went in, and certainly had not this time stopped\r\nto do so when he came out; they asked him why he had to go to the\r\ncellar at such a time of the day, and said it was because he had\r\nalready drunk all the wine that was left from dinner.  He said if he\r\nhad dropped the key, the key was to be found, and they must help him to\r\nfind it.  They told him they wouldn't move a peg for him.  He declared,\r\nwith much language, he would have them all turned out of the king's\r\nservice.  They said they would swear he was drunk.\r\n\r\nAnd so positive were they about it, that at last the butler himself\r\nbegan to think whether it was possible they could be in the right. For\r\nhe knew that sometimes when he had been drunk he fancied things had\r\ntaken place which he found afterward could not have happened. Certain\r\nof his fellow servants, however, had all the time a doubt whether the\r\ncellar goblin had not appeared to him, or at least roared at him, to\r\nprotect the wine.  In any case nobody wanted to find the key for him;\r\nnothing could please them better than that the door of the wine cellar\r\nshould never more be locked.  By degrees the hubbub died away, and they\r\ndeparted, not even pulling to the door, for there was neither handle\r\nnor latch to it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were gone, Curdie returned, knowing now that they were\r\nin the wine cellar of the palace, as indeed, he had suspected. Finding\r\na pool of wine in a hollow of the floor, Lina lapped it up eagerly: she\r\nhad had no breakfast, and was now very thirsty as well as hungry.  Her\r\nmaster was in a similar plight, for he had but just begun to eat when\r\nthe magistrate arrived with the soldiers.  If only they were all in\r\nbed, he thought, that he might find his way to the larder!  For he said\r\nto himself that, as he was sent there by the young princess's\r\ngreat-great-grandmother to serve her or her father in some way, surely\r\nhe must have a right to his food in the Palace, without which he could\r\ndo nothing.  He would go at once and reconnoitre.\r\n\r\nSo he crept up the stair that led from the cellar.  At the top was a\r\ndoor, opening on a long passage dimly lighted by a lamp.  He told Lina\r\nto lie down upon the stair while he went on.  At the end of the passage\r\nhe found a door ajar, and, peering through, saw right into a great\r\nstone hall, where a huge fire was blazing, and through which men in the\r\nking's livery were constantly coming and going. Some also in the same\r\nlivery were lounging about the fire.  He noted that their colours were\r\nthe same as those he himself, as king's miner, wore; but from what he\r\nhad seen and heard of the habits of the place, he could not hope they\r\nwould treat him the better for that.\r\n\r\nThe one interesting thing at the moment, however, was the plentiful\r\nsupper with which the table was spread.  It was something at least to\r\nstand in sight of food, and he was unwilling to turn his back on the\r\nprospect so long as a share in it was not absolutely hopeless. Peeping\r\nthus, he soon made UP his mind that if at any moment the hall should be\r\nempty, he would at that moment rush in and attempt to carry off a dish.\r\nThat he might lose no time by indecision, he selected a large pie upon\r\nwhich to pounce instantaneously.  But after he had watched for some\r\nminutes, it did not seem at all likely the chance would arrive before\r\nsuppertime, and he was just about to turn away and rejoin Lina, when he\r\nsaw that there was not a person in the place.  Curdie never made up his\r\nmind and then hesitated.  He darted in, seized the pie, and bore it\r\nswiftly and noiselessly to the cellar stair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18\r\n\r\nThe King's Kitchen\r\n\r\nBack to the cellar Curdie and Lina sped with their booty, where, seated\r\non the steps, Curdie lighted his bit of candle for a moment. A very\r\nlittle bit it was now, but they did not waste much of it in examination\r\nof the pie; that they effected by a more summary process.  Curdie\r\nthought it the nicest food he had ever tasted, and between them they\r\nsoon ate it up.  Then Curdie would have thrown the dish along with the\r\nbones into the water, that there might be no traces of them; but he\r\nthought of his mother, and hid it instead; and the very next minute\r\nthey wanted it to draw some wine into.  He was careful it should be\r\nfrom the cask of which he had seen the butler drink.\r\n\r\nThen they sat down again upon the steps, and waited until the house\r\nshould be quiet.  For he was there to do something, and if it did not\r\ncome to him in the cellar, he must go to meet it in other places.\r\nTherefore, lest he should fall asleep, he set the end of the helve of\r\nhis mattock on the ground, and seated himself on the cross part,\r\nleaning against the wall, so that as long as he kept awake he should\r\nrest, but the moment he began to fall asleep he must fall awake\r\ninstead.  He quite expected some of the servants would visit the cellar\r\nagain that night, but whether it was that they were afraid of each\r\nother, or believed more of the butler's story than they had chosen to\r\nallow, not one of them appeared.\r\n\r\nWhen at length he thought he might venture, he shouldered his mattock\r\nand crept up the stair.  The lamp was out in the passage, but he could\r\nnot miss his way to the servants' hall.  Trusting to Lina's quickness\r\nin concealing herself, he took her with him.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the hall they found it quiet and nearly dark. The\r\nlast of the great fire was glowing red, but giving little light.\r\nCurdie stood and warmed himself for a few moments: miner as he was, he\r\nhad found the cellar cold to sit in doing nothing; and standing thus he\r\nthought of looking if there were any bits of candle about.  There were\r\nmany candlesticks on the supper table, but to his disappointment and\r\nindignation their candles seemed to have been all left to burn out, and\r\nsome of them, indeed, he found still hot in the neck.\r\n\r\nPresently, one after another, he came upon seven men fast asleep, most\r\nof them upon tables, one in a chair, and one on the floor. They seemed,\r\nfrom their shape and colour, to have eaten and drunk so much that they\r\nmight be burned alive without wakening.  He grasped the hand of each in\r\nsuccession, and found two ox hoofs, three pig hoofs, one concerning\r\nwhich he could not be sure whether it was the hoof of a donkey or a\r\npony, and one dog's paw.  'A nice set of people to be about a king!'\r\nthought Curdie to himself, and turned again to his candle hunt.  He did\r\nat last find two or three little pieces, and stowed them away in his\r\npockets.  They now left the hall by another door, and entered a short\r\npassage, which led them to the huge kitchen, vaulted and black with\r\nsmoke.  There, too, the fire was still burning, so that he was able to\r\nsee a little of the state of things in this quarter also.\r\n\r\nThe place was dirty and disorderly.  In a recess, on a heap of\r\nbrushwood, lay a kitchen-maid, with a table cover around her, and a\r\nskillet in her hand: evidently she too had been drinking.  In another\r\ncorner lay a page, and Curdie noted how like his dress was to his own.\r\nIn the cinders before the hearth were huddled three dogs and five cats,\r\nall fast asleep, while the rats were running about the floor.  Curdie's\r\nheart ached to think of the lovely child-princess living over such a\r\nsty.  The mine was a paradise to a palace with such servants in it.\r\n\r\nLeaving the kitchen, he got into the region of the sculleries. There\r\nhorrible smells were wandering about, like evil spirits that come forth\r\nwith the darkness.  He lighted a candle--but only to see ugly sights.\r\nEverywhere was filth and disorder.  Mangy turnspit dogs were lying\r\nabout, and grey rats were gnawing at refuse in the sinks.  It was like\r\na hideous dream.  He felt as if he should never get out of it, and\r\nlonged for one glimpse of his mother's poor little kitchen, so clean\r\nand bright and airy. Turning from it at last in miserable disgust, he\r\nalmost ran back through the kitchen, re-entered the hall, and crossed\r\nit to another door.\r\n\r\nIt opened upon a wider passage leading to an arch in a stately\r\ncorridor, all its length lighted by lamps in niches.  At the end of it\r\nwas a large and beautiful hall, with great pillars.  There sat three\r\nmen in the royal livery, fast asleep, each in a great armchair, with\r\nhis feet on a huge footstool.  They looked like fools dreaming\r\nthemselves kings; and Lina looked as if she longed to throttle them.\r\nAt one side of the hall was the grand staircase, and they went up.\r\n\r\nEverything that now met Curdie's eyes was rich--not glorious like the\r\nsplendours of the mountain cavern, but rich and soft--except where, now\r\nand then, some rough old rib of the ancient fortress came through, hard\r\nand discoloured.  Now some dark bare arch of stone, now some rugged and\r\nblackened pillar, now some huge beam, brown with the smoke and dust of\r\ncenturies, looked like a thistle in the midst of daisies, or a rock in\r\na smooth lawn.\r\n\r\nThey wandered about a good while, again and again finding themselves\r\nwhere they had been before.  Gradually, however, Curdie was gaining\r\nsome idea of the place.  By and by Lina began to look frightened, and\r\nas they went on Curdie saw that she looked more and more frightened.\r\nNow, by this time he had come to understand that what made her look\r\nfrightened was always the fear of frightening, and he therefore\r\nconcluded they must be drawing nigh to somebody.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a gorgeously painted gallery, he saw a curtain of crimson,\r\nand on the curtain a royal crown wrought in silks and stones.  He felt\r\nsure this must be the king's chamber, and it was here he was wanted;\r\nor, if it was not the place he was bound for, something would meet him\r\nand turn him aside; for he had come to think that so long as a man\r\nwants to do right he may go where he can: when he can go no farther,\r\nthen it is not the way.  'Only,' said his father, in assenting to the\r\ntheory, 'he must really want to do right, and not merely fancy he does.\r\nHe must want it with his heart and will, and not with his rag of a\r\ntongue.'\r\n\r\nSo he gently lifted the corner of the curtain, and there behind it was\r\na half-open door.  He entered, and the moment he was in, Lina stretched\r\nherself along the threshold between the curtain and the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19\r\n\r\nThe King's Chamber\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a large room, dimly lighted by a silver lamp that\r\nhung from the ceiling.  Far at the other end was a great bed,\r\nsurrounded with dark heavy curtains.  He went softly toward it, his\r\nheart beating fast.  It was a dreadful thing to be alone in the king's\r\nchamber at the dead of night.  To gain courage he had to remind himself\r\nof the beautiful princess who had sent him.\r\n\r\nBut when he was about halfway to the bed, a figure appeared from the\r\nfarther side of it, and came towards him, with a hand raised warningly.\r\nHe stood still.  The light was dim, and he could distinguish little\r\nmore than the outline of a young girl.  But though the form he saw was\r\nmuch taller than the princess he remembered, he never doubted it was\r\nshe.  For one thing, he knew that most girls would have been frightened\r\nto see him there in the dead of the night, but like a true princess,\r\nand the princess he used to know, she walked straight on to meet him.\r\nAs she came she lowered the hand she had lifted, and laid the\r\nforefinger of it upon her lips.  Nearer and nearer, quite near, close\r\nup to him she came, then stopped, and stood a moment looking at him.\r\n\r\n'You are Curdie,' she said.\r\n\r\n'And you are the Princess Irene,' he returned.\r\n\r\n'Then we know each other still,' she said, with a sad smile of\r\npleasure.  'You will help me.'\r\n\r\n'That I will,' answered Curdie.  He did not say, 'If I can'; for he\r\nknew that what he was sent to do, that he could do.  'May I kiss your\r\nhand, little Princess?'\r\n\r\nShe was only between nine and ten, though indeed she looked several\r\nyears older, and her eyes almost those of a grown woman, for she had\r\nhad terrible trouble of late.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand.\r\n\r\n'I am not the little princess any more.  I have grown up since I saw\r\nyou last, Mr Miner.'\r\n\r\nThe smile which accompanied the words had in it a strange mixture of\r\nplayfulness and sadness.\r\n\r\n'So I see, Miss Princess,' returned Curdie; 'and therefore, being more\r\nof a princess, you are the more my princess.  Here I am, sent by your\r\ngreat-great-grandmother, to be your servant.  May I ask why you are up\r\nso late, Princess?'\r\n\r\n'Because my father wakes so frightened, and I don't know what he would\r\ndo if he didn't find me by his bedside.  There! he's waking now.'\r\n\r\nShe darted off to the side of the bed she had come from.\r\n\r\nCurdie stood where he was.\r\n\r\nA voice altogether unlike what he remembered of the mighty, noble king\r\non his white horse came from the bed, thin, feeble, hollow, and husky,\r\nand in tone like that of a petulant child:\r\n\r\n'I will not, I will not.  I am a king, and I will be a king.  I hate\r\nyou and despise you, and you shall not torture me!'\r\n\r\n'Never mind them, Father dear,' said the princess.  'I am here, and\r\nthey shan't touch you.  They dare not, you know, so long as you defy\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n'They want my crown, darling; and I can't give them my crown, can I?\r\nFor what is a king without his crown?'\r\n\r\n'They shall never have your crown, my king,' said Irene.  'Here it\r\nis--all safe.  I am watching it for you.'\r\n\r\nCurdie drew near the bed on the other side.  There lay the grand old\r\nking--he looked grand still, and twenty years older.  His body was\r\npillowed high; his beard descended long and white over the crimson\r\ncoverlid; and his crown, its diamonds and emeralds gleaming in the\r\ntwilight of the curtains, lay in front of him, his long thin old hands\r\nfolded round it, and the ends of his beard straying among the lovely\r\nstones.  His face was like that of a man who had died fighting nobly;\r\nbut one thing made it dreadful: his eyes, while they moved about as if\r\nsearching in this direction and in that, looked more dead than his\r\nface.  He saw neither his daughter nor his crown: it was the voice of\r\nthe one and the touch of the other that comforted him.  He kept\r\nmurmuring what seemed words, but was unintelligible to Curdie,\r\nalthough, to judge from the look of Irene's face, she learned and\r\nconcluded from it.\r\n\r\nBy degrees his voice sank away and the murmuring ceased, although still\r\nhis lips moved.  Thus lay the old king on his bed, slumbering with his\r\ncrown between his hands; on one side of him stood a lovely little\r\nmaiden, with blue eyes, and brown hair going a little back from her\r\ntemples, as if blown by a wind that no one felt but herself; and on the\r\nother a stalwart young miner, with his mattock over his shoulder.\r\nStranger sight still was Lina lying along the threshold--only nobody\r\nsaw her just then.\r\n\r\nA moment more and the king's lips ceased to move.  His breathing had\r\ngrown regular and quiet.  The princess gave a sigh of relief, and came\r\nround to Curdie.\r\n\r\n'We can talk a little now,' she said, leading him toward the middle of\r\nthe room.  'My father will sleep now till the doctor wakes him to give\r\nhim his medicine.  It is not really medicine, though, but wine.\r\nNothing but that, the doctor says, could have kept him so long alive.\r\nHe always comes in the middle of the night to give it him with his own\r\nhands.  But it makes me cry to see him wake up when so nicely asleep.'\r\n\r\n'What sort of man is your doctor?' asked Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Oh, such a dear, good, kind gentleman!' replied the princess.  'He\r\nspeaks so softly, and is so sorry for his dear king!  He will be here\r\npresently, and you shall see for yourself.  You will like him very\r\nmuch.'\r\n\r\n'Has your king-father been long ill?' asked Curdie.\r\n\r\n'A whole year now,' she replied.  'Did you not know?  That's how your\r\nmother never got the red petticoat my father promised her. The lord\r\nchancellor told me that not only Gwyntystorm but the whole land was\r\nmourning over the illness of the good man.'\r\n\r\nNow Curdie himself had not heard a word of His Majesty's illness, and\r\nhad no ground for believing that a single soul in any place he had\r\nvisited on his journey had heard of it.  Moreover, although mention had\r\nbeen made of His Majesty again and again in his hearing since he came\r\nto Gwyntystorm, never once had he heard an allusion to the state of his\r\nhealth.  And now it dawned upon him also that he had never heard the\r\nleast expression of love to him.  But just for the time he thought it\r\nbetter to say nothing on either point.\r\n\r\n'Does the king wander like this every night?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Every night,' answered Irene, shaking her head mournfully.  'That is\r\nwhy I never go to bed at night.  He is better during the day--a little,\r\nand then I sleep--in the dressing room there, to be with him in a\r\nmoment if he should call me.  It is so sad he should have only me and\r\nnot my mamma!  A princess is nothing to a queen!'\r\n\r\n'I wish he would like me,' said Curdie, 'for then I might watch by him\r\nat night, and let you go to bed, Princess.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you know then?' returned Irene, in wonder.  'How was it you\r\ncame?  Ah!  You said my grandmother sent you.  But I thought you knew\r\nthat he wanted you.'\r\n\r\nAnd again she opened wide her blue stars.\r\n\r\n'Not I,' said Curdie, also bewildered, but very glad.\r\n\r\n'He used to be constantly saying--he was not so ill then as he is\r\nnow--that he wished he had you about him.'\r\n\r\n'And I never to know it!' said Curdie, with displeasure.\r\n\r\n'The master of the horse told papa's own secretary that he had written\r\nto the miner-general to find you and send you up; but the miner-general\r\nwrote back to the master of the horse, and he told the secretary, and\r\nthe secretary told my father, that they had searched every mine in the\r\nkingdom and could hear nothing of you. My father gave a great sigh, and\r\nsaid he feared the goblins had got you, after all, and your father and\r\nmother were dead of grief.  And he has never mentioned you since,\r\nexcept when wandering.  I cried very much.  But one of my grandmother's\r\npigeons with its white wing flashed a message to me through the window\r\none day, and then I knew that my Curdie wasn't eaten by the goblins,\r\nfor my grandmother wouldn't have taken care of him one time to let him\r\nbe eaten the next.  Where were you, Curdie, that they couldn't find\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'We will talk about that another time, when we are not expecting the\r\ndoctor,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his eyes fell upon something shining on the table under\r\nthe lamp.  His heart gave a great throb, and he went nearer. Yes, there\r\ncould be no doubt--it was the same flagon that the butler had filled in\r\nthe wine cellar.\r\n\r\n'It looks worse and worse!'he said to himself, and went back to Irene,\r\nwhere she stood half dreaming.\r\n\r\n'When will the doctor be here?' he asked once more--this time hurriedly.\r\n\r\nThe question was answered--not by the princess, but by something which\r\nthat instant tumbled heavily into the room.  Curdie flew toward it in\r\nvague terror about Lina.\r\n\r\nOn the floor lay a little round man, puffing and blowing, and uttering\r\nincoherent language.  Curdie thought of his mattock, and ran and laid\r\nit aside.\r\n\r\n'Oh, dear Dr Kelman!' cried the princess, running up and taking hold of\r\nhis arm; 'I am so sorry!'  She pulled and pulled, but might almost as\r\nwell have tried to set up a cannon ball.  'I hope you have not hurt\r\nyourself?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all, not at all,' said the doctor, trying to smile and to rise\r\nboth at once, but finding it impossible to do either.\r\n\r\n'If he slept on the floor he would be late for breakfast,' said Curdie\r\nto himself, and held out his hand to help him.\r\n\r\nBut when he took hold of it, Curdie very nearly let him fall again, for\r\nwhat he held was not even a foot: it was the belly of a creeping thing.\r\nHe managed, however, to hold both his peace and his grasp, and pulled\r\nthe doctor roughly on his legs--such as they were.\r\n\r\n'Your Royal Highness has rather a thick mat at the door,' said the\r\ndoctor, patting his palms together.  'I hope my awkwardness may not\r\nhave startled His Majesty.'\r\n\r\nWhile he talked Curdie went to the door: Lina was not there.\r\n\r\nThe doctor approached the bed.\r\n\r\n'And how has my beloved king slept tonight?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'No better,' answered Irene, with a mournful shake of her head.\r\n\r\n'Ah, that is very well!' returned the doctor, his fall seeming to have\r\nmuddled either his words or his meaning.  'When we give him his wine,\r\nhe will be better still.'\r\n\r\nCurdie darted at the flagon, and lifted it high, as if he had expected\r\nto find it full, but had found it empty.\r\n\r\n'That stupid butler!  I heard them say he was drunk!' he cried in a\r\nloud whisper, and was gliding from the room.\r\n\r\n'Come here with that flagon, you!  Page!' cried the doctor. Curdie came\r\na few steps toward him with the flagon dangling from his hand, heedless\r\nof the gushes that fell noiseless on the thick carpet.\r\n\r\n'Are you aware, young man,' said the doctor, 'that it is not every wine\r\ncan do His Majesty the benefit I intend he should derive from my\r\nprescription?'\r\n\r\n'Quite aware, sir, answered Curdie.  'The wine for His Majesty's use is\r\nin the third cask from the corner.'\r\n\r\n'Fly, then,' said the doctor, looking satisfied.\r\n\r\nCurdie stopped outside the curtain and blew an audible breath--no more;\r\nup came Lina noiseless as a shadow.  He showed her the flagon.\r\n\r\n'The cellar, Lina: go,' he said.\r\n\r\nShe galloped away on her soft feet, and Curdie had indeed to fly to\r\nkeep up with her.  Not once did she make even a dubious turn.  From the\r\nking's gorgeous chamber to the cold cellar they shot.  Curdie dashed\r\nthe wine down the back stair, rinsed the flagon out as he had seen the\r\nbutler do, filled it from the cask of which he had seen the butler\r\ndrink, and hastened with it up again to the king's room.\r\n\r\nThe little doctor took it, poured out a full glass, smelt, but did not\r\ntaste it, and set it down.  Then he leaned over the bed, shouted in the\r\nking's ear, blew upon his eyes, and pinched his arm: Curdie thought he\r\nsaw him run something bright into it.  At last the king half woke.  The\r\ndoctor seized the glass, raised his head, poured the wine down his\r\nthroat, and let his head fall back on the pillow again.  Tenderly\r\nwiping his beard, and bidding the princess good night in paternal\r\ntones, he then took his leave.  Curdie would gladly have driven his\r\npick into his head, but that was not in his commission, and he let him\r\ngo.  The little round man looked very carefully to his feet as he\r\ncrossed the threshold.\r\n\r\n'That attentive fellow of a page has removed the mat,' he said to\r\nhimself, as he walked along the corridor.  'I must remember him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20\r\n\r\nCounterplotting\r\n\r\nCurdie was already sufficiently enlightened as to how things were\r\ngoing, to see that he must have the princess of one mind with him, and\r\nthey must work together.  It was clear that among those about the king\r\nthere was a plot against him: for one thing, they had agreed in a lie\r\nconcerning himself; and it was plain also that the doctor was working\r\nout a design against the health and reason of His Majesty, rendering\r\nthe question of his life a matter of little moment.  It was in itself\r\nsufficient to justify the worst fears, that the people outside the\r\npalace were ignorant of His Majesty's condition: he believed those\r\ninside it also--the butler excepted--were ignorant of it as well.\r\nDoubtless His Majesty's councillors desired to alienate the hearts of\r\nhis subjects from their sovereign.  Curdie's idea was that they\r\nintended to kill the king, marry the princess to one of themselves, and\r\nfound a new dynasty; but whatever their purpose, there was treason in\r\nthe palace of the worst sort: they were making and keeping the king\r\nincapable, in order to effect that purpose.  The first thing to be seen\r\nto, therefore, was that His Majesty should neither eat morsel nor drink\r\ndrop of anything prepared for him in the palace.  Could this have been\r\nmanaged without the princess, Curdie would have preferred leaving her\r\nin ignorance of the horrors from which he sought to deliver her.  He\r\nfeared also the danger of her knowledge betraying itself to the evil\r\neyes about her; but it must be risked and she had always been a wise\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nAnother thing was clear to him--that with such traitors no terms of\r\nhonour were either binding or possible, and that, short of lying, he\r\nmight use any means to foil them.  And he could not doubt that the old\r\nprincess had sent him expressly to frustrate their plans.\r\n\r\nWhile he stood thinking thus with himself, the princess was earnestly\r\nwatching the king, with looks of childish love and womanly tenderness\r\nthat went to Curdie's heart.  Now and then with a great fan of peacock\r\nfeathers she would fan him very softly; now and then, seeing a cloud\r\nbegin to gather upon the sky of his sleeping face, she would climb upon\r\nthe bed, and bending to his ear whisper into it, then draw back and\r\nwatch again--generally to see the cloud disperse.  In his deepest\r\nslumber, the soul of the king lay open to the voice of his child, and\r\nthat voice had power either to change the aspect of his visions, or,\r\nwhich was better still, to breathe hope into his heart, and courage to\r\nendure them.\r\n\r\nCurdie came near, and softly called her.\r\n\r\n'I can't leave Papa just yet,' she returned, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n'I will wait,' said Curdie; 'but I want very much to say something.'\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she came to him where he stood under the lamp.\r\n\r\n'Well, Curdie, what is it?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Princess,' he replied, 'I want to tell you that I have found why your\r\ngrandmother sent me.'\r\n\r\n'Come this way, then, she answered, 'where I can see the face of my\r\nking.'\r\n\r\nCurdie placed a chair for her in the spot she chose, where she would be\r\nnear enough to mark any slightest change on her father's countenance,\r\nyet where their low-voiced talk would not disturb him. There he sat\r\ndown beside her and told her all the story--how her grandmother had\r\nsent her good pigeon for him, and how she had instructed him, and sent\r\nhim there without telling him what he had to do.  Then he told her what\r\nhe had discovered of the state of things generally in Gwyntystorm, and\r\nespecially what he had heard and seen in the palace that night.\r\n\r\n'Things are in a bad state enough,' he said in conclusion--'lying and\r\nselfishness and inhospitality and dishonesty everywhere; and to crown\r\nall, they speak with disrespect of the good king, and not a man knows\r\nhe is ill.'\r\n\r\n'You frighten me dreadfully,' said Irene, trembling.\r\n\r\n'You must be brave for your king's sake,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Indeed I will,' she replied, and turned a long loving look upon the\r\nbeautiful face of her father.  'But what is to be done?  And how am I\r\nto believe such horrible things of Dr Kelman?'\r\n\r\n'My dear Princess,' replied Curdie, 'you know nothing of him but his\r\nface and his tongue, and they are both false.  Either you must beware\r\nof him, or you must doubt your grandmother and me; for I tell you, by\r\nthe gift she gave me of testing hands, that this man is a snake.  That\r\nround body he shows is but the case of a serpent. Perhaps the creature\r\nlies there, as in its nest, coiled round and round inside.'\r\n\r\n'Horrible!' said Irene.\r\n\r\n'Horrible indeed; but we must not try to get rid of horrible things by\r\nrefusing to look at them, and saying they are not there.  Is not your\r\nbeautiful father sleeping better since he had the wine?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Does he always sleep better after having it?'\r\n\r\nShe reflected an instant.\r\n\r\n'No; always worse--till tonight,' she answered.\r\n\r\n'Then remember that was the wine I got him--not what the butler drew.\r\nNothing that passes through any hand in the house except yours or mine\r\nmust henceforth, till he is well, reach His Majesty's lips.'\r\n\r\n'But how, dear Curdie?' said the princess, almost crying.\r\n\r\n'That we must contrive,' answered Curdie.  'I know how to take care of\r\nthe wine; but for his food--now we must think.'\r\n\r\n'He takes hardly any,' said the princess, with a pathetic shake of her\r\nlittle head which Curdie had almost learned to look for.\r\n\r\n'The more need,' he replied, 'there should be no poison in it.' Irene\r\nshuddered.  'As soon as he has honest food he will begin to grow\r\nbetter.  And you must be just as careful with yourself, Princess,'\r\nCurdie went on, 'for you don't know when they may begin to poison you,\r\ntoo.'\r\n\r\n'There's no fear of me; don't talk about me,' said Irene.  'The good\r\nfood!  How are we to get it, Curdie?  That is the whole question.'\r\n\r\n'I am thinking hard,' answered Curdie.  'The good food?  Let me\r\nsee--let me see!  Such servants as I saw below are sure to have the\r\nbest of everything for themselves: I will go an see what I can find on\r\ntheir table.'\r\n\r\n'The chancellor sleeps in the house, and he and the master of the\r\nking's horse always have their supper together in a room off the great\r\nhall, to the right as you go down the stairs,' said Irene. 'I would go\r\nwith you, but I dare not leave my father.  Alas!  He scarcely ever\r\ntakes more than a mouthful.  I can't think how he lives!  And the very\r\nthing he would like, and often asks for--a bit of bread--I can hardly\r\never get for him: Dr Kelman has forbidden it, and says it is nothing\r\nless than poison to him.'\r\n\r\n'Bread at least he shall have,' said Curdie; 'and that, with the honest\r\nwine, will do as well as anything, I do believe.  I will go at once and\r\nlook for some.  But I want you to see Lina first, and know her, lest,\r\ncoming upon her by accident at any time, you should be frightened.'\r\n\r\n'I should like much to see her,' said the princess.\r\n\r\nWarning her not to be startled by her ugliness, he went to the door and\r\ncalled her.\r\n\r\nShe entered, creeping with downcast head, and dragging her tail over\r\nthe floor behind her.  Curdie watched the princess as the frightful\r\ncreature came nearer and nearer.  One shudder went from head to foot,\r\nand next instant she stepped to meet her.  Lina dropped flat on the\r\nfloor, and covered her face with her two big paws.  It went to the\r\nheart of the princess: in a moment she was on her knees beside her,\r\nstroking her ugly head, and patting her all over.\r\n\r\n'Good dog!  Dear ugly dog!' she said.\r\n\r\nLina whimpered.\r\n\r\n'I believe,' said Curdie, 'from what your grandmother told me, that\r\nLina is a woman, and that she was naughty, but is now growing good.'\r\n\r\nLina had lifted her head while Irene was caressing her; now she dropped\r\nit again between her paws; but the princess took it in her hands, and\r\nkissed the forehead betwixt the gold-green eyes.\r\n\r\n'Shall I take her with me or leave her?' asked Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Leave her, poor dear,' said Irene, and Curdie, knowing the way now,\r\nwent without her.\r\n\r\nHe took his way first to the room the princess had spoken of, and there\r\nalso were the remains of supper; but neither there nor in the kitchen\r\ncould he find a scrap of plain wholesome-looking bread.  So he returned\r\nand told her that as soon as it was light he would go into the city for\r\nsome, and asked her for a handkerchief to tie it in.  If he could not\r\nbring it himself, he would send it by Lina, who could keep out of sight\r\nbetter than he, and as soon as all was quiet at night he would come to\r\nher again.  He also asked her to tell the king that he was in the\r\nhouse.  His hope lay in the fact that bakers everywhere go to work\r\nearly.  But it was yet much too early.  So he persuaded the princess to\r\nlie down, promising to call her if the king should stir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21\r\n\r\nThe Loaf\r\n\r\nHis Majesty slept very quietly.  The dawn had grown almost day, and\r\nstill Curdie lingered, unwilling to disturb the princess.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, he called her, and she was in the room in a moment.\r\nShe had slept, she said, and felt quite fresh.  Delighted to find her\r\nfather still asleep, and so peacefully, she pushed her chair close to\r\nthe bed, and sat down with her hands in her lap.\r\n\r\nCurdie got his mattock from where he had hidden it behind a great\r\nmirror, and went to the cellar, followed by Lina.  They took some\r\nbreakfast with them as they passed through the hall, and as soon as\r\nthey had eaten it went out the back way.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the passage Curdie seized the rope, drew himself up,\r\npushed away the shutter, and entered the dungeon.  Then he swung the\r\nend of the rope to Lina, and she caught it in her teeth. When her\r\nmaster said, 'Now, Lina!' she gave a great spring, and he ran away with\r\nthe end of the rope as fast as ever he could.  And such a spring had\r\nshe made, that by the time he had to bear her weight she was within a\r\nfew feet of the hole.  The instant she got a paw through, she was all\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nApparently their enemies were waiting till hunger should have cowed\r\nthem, for there was no sign of any attempt having been made to open the\r\ndoor.  A blow or two of Curdie's mattock drove the shattered lock clean\r\nfrom it, and telling Lina to wait there till he came back, and let no\r\none in, he walked out into the silent street, and drew the door to\r\nbehind them.  He could hardly believe it was not yet a whole day since\r\nhe had been thrown in there with his hands tied at his back.\r\n\r\nDown the town he went, walking in the middle of the street, that, if\r\nany one saw him, he might see he was not afraid, and hesitate to rouse\r\nan attack on him.  As to the dogs, ever since the death of their two\r\ncompanions, a shadow that looked like a mattock was enough to make them\r\nscamper.  As soon as he reached the archway of the city gate he turned\r\nto reconnoitre the baker's shop, and perceiving no sign of movement,\r\nwaited there watching for the first.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour, the door opened, and the baker's man appeared with\r\na pail in his hand.  He went to a pump that stood in the street, and\r\nhaving filled his pail returned with it into the shop. Curdie stole\r\nafter him, found the door on the latch, opened it very gently, peeped\r\nin, saw nobody, and entered.  Remembering perfectly from what shelf the\r\nbaker's wife had taken the loaf she said was the best, and seeing just\r\none upon it, he seized it, laid the price of it on the counter, and\r\nsped softly out, and up the street.  Once more in the dungeon beside\r\nLina, his first thought was to fasten up the door again, which would\r\nhave been easy, so many iron fragments of all sorts and sizes lay\r\nabout; but he bethought himself that if he left it as it was, and they\r\ncame to find him, they would conclude at once that they had made their\r\nescape by it, and would look no farther so as to discover the hole.  He\r\ntherefore merely pushed the door close and left it.  Then once more\r\ncarefully arranging the earth behind the shutter, so that it should\r\nagain fall with it, he returned to the cellar.\r\n\r\nAnd now he had to convey the loaf to the princess.  If he could venture\r\nto take it himself, well; if not, he would send Lina.  He crept to the\r\ndoor of the servants' hall, and found the sleepers beginning to stir.\r\nOne said it was time to go to bed; another, that he would go to the\r\ncellar instead, and have a mug of wine to waken him up; while a third\r\nchallenged a fourth to give him his revenge at some game or other.\r\n\r\n'Oh, hang your losses!' answered his companion; 'you'll soon pick up\r\ntwice as much about the house, if you but keep your eyes open.'\r\n\r\nPerceiving there would be risk in attempting to pass through, and\r\nreflecting that the porters in the great hall would probably be awake\r\nalso, Curdie went back to the cellar, took Irene's handkerchief with\r\nthe loaf in it, tied it round Lina's neck, and told her to take it to\r\nthe princess.\r\n\r\nUsing every shadow and every shelter, Lina slid through the servants\r\nlike a shapeless terror through a guilty mind, and so, by corridor and\r\ngreat hall, up the stair to the king's chamber.\r\n\r\nIrene trembled a little when she saw her glide soundless in across the\r\nsilent dusk of the morning, that filtered through the heavy drapery of\r\nthe windows, but she recovered herself at once when she saw the bundle\r\nabout her neck, for it both assured her of Curdie's safety, and gave\r\nher hope of her father's.  She untied it with joy, and Lina stole away,\r\nsilent as she had come.  Her joy was the greater that the king had\r\nwaked up a little before, and expressed a desire for food--not that he\r\nfelt exactly hungry, he said, and yet he wanted something.  If only he\r\nmight have a piece of nice fresh bread!  Irene had no knife, but with\r\neager hands she broke a great piece from the loaf, and poured out a\r\nfull glass of wine. The king ate and drank, enjoyed the bread and the\r\nwine much, and instantly fell asleep again.\r\n\r\nIt was hours before the lazy people brought their breakfast.  When it\r\ncame, Irene crumbled a little about, threw some into the fireplace, and\r\nmanaged to make the tray look just as usual.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, down below in the cellar, Curdie was lying in the\r\nhollow between the upper sides of two of the great casks, the warmest\r\nplace he could find.  Lina was watching.  She lay at his feet, across\r\nthe two casks, and did her best so to arrange her huge tail that it\r\nshould be a warm coverlid for her master.\r\n\r\nBy and by Dr Kelman called to see his patient; and now that Irene's\r\neyes were opened, she saw clearly enough that he was both annoyed and\r\npuzzled at finding His Majesty rather better.  He pretended however to\r\ncongratulate him, saying he believed he was quite fit to see the lord\r\nchamberlain: he wanted his signature to something important; only he\r\nmust not strain his mind to understand it, whatever it might be: if His\r\nMajesty did, he would not be answerable for the consequences.  The king\r\nsaid he would see the lord chamberlain, and the doctor went.\r\n\r\nThen Irene gave him more bread and wine, and the king ate and drank,\r\nand smiled a feeble smile, the first real one she had seen for many a\r\nday.  He said he felt much better, and would soon be able to take\r\nmatters into his own hands again.  He had a strange miserable feeling,\r\nhe said, that things were going terribly wrong, although he could not\r\ntell how.  Then the princess told him that Curdie had come, and that at\r\nnight, when all was quiet for nobody in the palace must know, he would\r\npay His Majesty a visit.  Her great-great-grandmother had sent him, she\r\nsaid.  The king looked strangely upon her, but the strange look passed\r\ninto a smile clearer than the first, and irene's heart throbbed with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chamberlain\r\n\r\nAt noon the lord chamberlain appeared.  With a long, low bow, and paper\r\nin hand, he stepped softly into the room.  Greeting His Majesty with\r\nevery appearance of the profoundest respect, and congratulating him on\r\nthe evident progress he had made, he declared himself sorry to trouble\r\nhim, but there were certain papers, he said, which required his\r\nsignature--and therewith drew nearer to the king, who lay looking at\r\nhim doubtfully.  He was a lean, long, yellow man, with a small head,\r\nbald over the top, and tufted at the back and about the ears.  He had a\r\nvery thin, prominent, hooked nose, and a quantity of loose skin under\r\nhis chin and about the throat, which came craning up out of his\r\nneckcloth.  His eyes were very small, sharp, and glittering, and looked\r\nblack as jet.  He had hardly enough of a mouth to make a smile with.\r\nHis left hand held the paper, and the long, skinny fingers of his right\r\na pen just dipped in ink.\r\n\r\nBut the king, who for weeks had scarcely known what he did, was today\r\nso much himself as to be aware that he was not quite himself; and the\r\nmoment he saw the paper, he resolved that he would not sign without\r\nunderstanding and approving of it.  He requested the lord chamberlain\r\ntherefore to read it.  His Lordship commenced at once but the\r\ndifficulties he seemed to encounter, and the fits of stammering that\r\nseized him, roused the king's suspicion tenfold. He called the princess.\r\n\r\n'I trouble His Lordship too much,' he said to her: 'you can read print\r\nwell, my child--let me hear how you can read writing.  Take that paper\r\nfrom His Lordship's hand, and read it to me from beginning to end,\r\nwhile my lord drinks a glass of my favourite wine, and watches for your\r\nblunders.'\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, Your Majesty,' said the lord chamberlain, with as much of a\r\nsmile as he was able to extemporize, 'but it were a thousand pities to\r\nput the attainments of Her Royal Highness to a test altogether too\r\nsevere.  Your Majesty can scarcely with justice expect the very organs\r\nof her speech to prove capable of compassing words so long, and to her\r\nso unintelligible.'\r\n\r\n'I think much of my little princess and her capabilities,' returned the\r\nking, more and more aroused.  'Pray, my lord, permit her to try.'\r\n\r\n'Consider, Your Majesty: the thing would be altogether without\r\nprecedent.  It would be to make sport of statecraft,' said the lord\r\nchamberlain.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you are right, my lord,' answered the king, with more meaning\r\nthan he intended should be manifest, while to his growing joy he felt\r\nnew life and power throbbing in heart and brain.  'So this morning we\r\nshall read no further.  I am indeed ill able for business of such\r\nweight.'\r\n\r\n'Will Your Majesty please sign your royal name here?' said the lord\r\nchamberlain, preferring the request as a matter of course, and\r\napproaching with the feather end of the pen pointed to a spot where\r\nthere was a great red seal.\r\n\r\n'Not today, my lord,' replied the king.\r\n\r\n'It is of the greatest importance, Your Majesty,' softly insisted the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n'I descried no such importance in it,' said the king.\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty heard but a part.'\r\n\r\n'And I can hear no more today.'\r\n\r\n'I trust Your Majesty has ground enough, in a case of necessity like\r\nthe present, to sign upon the representation of his loyal subject and\r\nchamberlain?  Or shall I call the lord chancellor?' he added, rising.\r\n\r\n'There is no need.  I have the very highest opinion of your judgement,\r\nmy lord,' answered the king; 'that is, with respect to means: we might\r\ndiffer as to ends.'\r\n\r\nThe lord chamberlain made yet further attempts at persuasion; but they\r\ngrew feebler and feebler, and he was at last compelled to retire\r\nwithout having gained his object.  And well might his annoyance be\r\nkeen!  For that paper was the king's will, drawn up by the\r\nattorney-general; nor until they had the king's signature to it was\r\nthere much use in venturing farther.  But his worst sense of\r\ndiscomfiture arose from finding the king with so much capacity left,\r\nfor the doctor had pledged himself so to weaken his brain that he\r\nshould be as a child in their hands, incapable of refusing anything\r\nrequested of him: His Lordship began to doubt the doctor's fidelity to\r\nthe conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe princess was in high delight.  She had not for weeks heard so many\r\nwords, not to say words of such strength and reason, from her father's\r\nlips: day by day he had been growing weaker and more lethargic.  He was\r\nso much exhausted, however, after this effort, that he asked for\r\nanother piece of bread and more wine, and fell fast asleep the moment\r\nhe had taken them.\r\n\r\nThe lord chamberlain sent in a rage for Dr Kelman.  He came, and while\r\nprofessing himself unable to understand the symptoms described by His\r\nLordship, yet pledged himself again that on the morrow the king should\r\ndo whatever was required of him.\r\n\r\nThe day went on.  When His Majesty was awake, the princess read to\r\nhim--one storybook after another; and whatever she read, the king\r\nlistened as if he had never heard anything so good before, making out\r\nin it the wisest meanings.  Every now and then he asked for a piece of\r\nbread and a little wine, and every time he ate and drank he slept, and\r\nevery time he woke he seemed better than the last time.  The princess\r\nbearing her part, the loaf was eaten up and the flagon emptied before\r\nnight.  The butler took the flagon away, and brought it back filled to\r\nthe brim, but both were thirsty and hungry when Curdie came again.\r\n\r\nMeantime he and Lina, watching and waking alternately, had plenty of\r\nsleep.  In the afternoon, peeping from the recess, they saw several of\r\nthe servants enter hurriedly, one after the other, draw wine, drink it,\r\nand steal out; but their business was to take care of the king, not of\r\nhis cellar, and they let them drink.  Also, when the butler came to\r\nfill the flagon, they restrained themselves, for the villain's fate was\r\nnot yet ready for him.  He looked terribly frightened, and had brought\r\nwith him a large candle and a small terrier--which latter indeed\r\nthreatened to be troublesome, for he went roving and sniffing about\r\nuntil he came to the recess where they were.  But as soon as he showed\r\nhimself, Lina opened her jaws so wide, and glared at him so horribly,\r\nthat, without even uttering a whimper, he tucked his tail between his\r\nlegs and ran to his master.  He was drawing the wicked wine at the\r\nmoment, and did not see him, else he would doubtless have run too.\r\n\r\nWhen suppertime approached, Curdie took his place at the door into the\r\nservants' hall; but after a long hour's vain watch, he began to fear he\r\nshould get nothing: there was so much idling about, as well as coming\r\nand going.  It was hard to bear--chiefly from the attractions of a\r\nsplendid loaf, just fresh out of the oven, which he longed to secure\r\nfor the king and princess.  At length his chance did arrive: he pounced\r\nupon the loaf and carried it away, and soon after got hold of a pie.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, both loaf and pie were missed.  The cook was\r\ncalled.  He declared he had provided both.  One of themselves, he said,\r\nmust have carried them away for some friend outside the palace.  Then a\r\nhousemaid, who had not long been one of them, said she had seen someone\r\nlike a page running in the direction of the cellar with something in\r\nhis hands.  Instantly all turned upon the pages, accusing them, one\r\nafter another.  All denied, but nobody believed one of them: Where\r\nthere is no truth there can be no faith.\r\n\r\nTo the cellar they all set out to look for the missing pie and loaf.\r\nLina heard them coming, as well she might, for they were talking and\r\nquarrelling loud, and gave her master warning.  They snatched up\r\neverything, and got all signs of their presence out at the back door\r\nbefore the servants entered.  When they found nothing, they all turned\r\non the chambermaid, and accused her, not only of lying against the\r\npages, but of having taken the things herself.  Their language and\r\nbehaviour so disgusted Curdie, who could hear a great part of what\r\npassed, and he saw the danger of discovery now so much increased, that\r\nhe began to devise how best at once to rid the palace of the whole pack\r\nof them.  That, however, would be small gain so long as the treacherous\r\nofficers of state continued in it.  They must be first dealt with.  A\r\nthought came to him, and the longer he looked at it the better he liked\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the servants were gone, quarrelling and accusing all the\r\nway, they returned and finished their supper.  Then Curdie, who had\r\nlong been satisfied that Lina understood almost every word he said,\r\ncommunicated his plan to her, and knew by the wagging of her tail and\r\nthe flashing of her eyes that she comprehended it.  Until they had the\r\nking safe through the worst part of the night, however, nothing could\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nThey had now merely to go on waiting where they were till the household\r\nshould be asleep.  This waiting and waiting was much the hardest thing\r\nCurdie had to do in the whole affair.  He took his mattock and, going\r\nagain into the long passage, lighted a candle end and proceeded to\r\nexamine the rock on all sides.  But this was not merely to pass the\r\ntime: he had a reason for it.  When he broke the stone in the street,\r\nover which the baker fell, its appearance led him to pocket a fragment\r\nfor further examination; and since then he had satisfied himself that\r\nit was the kind of stone in which gold is found, and that the yellow\r\nparticles in it were pure metal.  If such stone existed here in any\r\nplenty, he could soon make the king rich and independent of his\r\nill-conditioned subjects. He was therefore now bent on an examination\r\nof the rock; nor had he been at it long before he was persuaded that\r\nthere were large quantities of gold in the half-crystalline white\r\nstone, with its veins of opaque white and of green, of which the rock,\r\nso far as he had been able to inspect it, seemed almost entirely to\r\nconsist. Every piece he broke was spotted with particles and little\r\nlumps of a lovely greenish yellow--and that was gold.  Hitherto he had\r\nworked only in silver, but he had read, and heard talk, and knew,\r\ntherefore, about gold.  As soon as he had got the king free of rogues\r\nand villains, he would have all the best and most honest miners, with\r\nhis father at the head of them, to work this rock for the king.\r\n\r\nIt was a great delight to him to use his mattock once more.  The time\r\nwent quickly, and when he left the passage to go to the king's chamber,\r\nhe had already a good heap of fragments behind the broken door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23\r\n\r\nDr Kelman\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had reason to hope the way was clear, Curdie ventured\r\nsoftly into the hall, with Lina behind him.  There was no one asleep on\r\nthe bench or floor, but by the fading fire sat a girl weeping.  It was\r\nthe same who had seen him carrying off the food, and had been so hardly\r\nused for saying so.  She opened her eyes when he appeared, but did not\r\nseem frightened at him.\r\n\r\n'I know why you weep,' said Curdie, 'and I am sorry for you.'\r\n\r\n'It is hard not to be believed just because one speaks the truth,' said\r\nthe girl, 'but that seems reason enough with some people.  My mother\r\ntaught me to speak the truth, and took such pains with me that I should\r\nfind it hard to tell a lie, though I could invent many a story these\r\nservants would believe at once; for the truth is a strange thing here,\r\nand they don't know it when they see it. Show it them, and they all\r\nstare as if it were a wicked lie, and that with the lie yet warm that\r\nhas just left their own mouths! You are a stranger,' she said, and\r\nburst out weeping afresh, 'but the stranger you are to such a place and\r\nsuch people the better!'\r\n\r\n'I am the person,' said Curdie, whom you saw carrying the things from\r\nthe supper table.'  He showed her the loaf.  'If you can trust, as well\r\nas speak the truth, I will trust you.  Can you trust me?'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him steadily for a moment.\r\n\r\n'I can,' she answered.\r\n\r\n'One thing more,' said Curdie: 'have you courage as well as truth?'\r\n\r\n'I think so.'\r\n\r\n'Look my dog in the face and don't cry out.  Come here, Lina.'\r\n\r\nLina obeyed.  The girl looked at her, and laid her hand on Lina's head.\r\n\r\n'Now I know you are a true woman,' said curdie.  'I am come to set\r\nthings right in this house.  Not one of the servants knows I am here.\r\nWill you tell them tomorrow morning that, if they do not alter their\r\nways, and give over drinking, and lying, and stealing, and unkindness,\r\nthey shall every one of them be driven from the palace?'\r\n\r\n'They will not believe me.'\r\n\r\n'Most likely; but will you give them the chance?'\r\n\r\n'I will.'\r\n\r\n'Then I will be your friend.  Wait here till I come again.'\r\n\r\nShe looked him once more in the face, and sat down.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the royal chamber, he found His Majesty awake, and very\r\nanxiously expecting him.  He received him with the utmost kindness, and\r\nat once, as it were, put himself in his hands by telling him all he\r\nknew concerning the state he was in.  His voice was feeble, but his eye\r\nwas clear, although now and then his words and thoughts seemed to\r\nwander.  Curdie could not be certain that the cause of their not being\r\nintelligible to him did not lie in himself.  The king told him that for\r\nsome years, ever since his queen's death, he had been losing heart over\r\nthe wickedness of his people.  He had tried hard to make them good, but\r\nthey got worse and worse.  Evil teachers, unknown to him, had crept\r\ninto the schools; there was a general decay of truth and right\r\nprinciple at least in the city; and as that set the example to the\r\nnation, it must spread.\r\n\r\nThe main cause of his illness was the despondency with which the\r\ndegeneration of his people affected him.  He could not sleep, and had\r\nterrible dreams; while, to his unspeakable shame and distress, he\r\ndoubted almost everybody.  He had striven against his suspicion, but in\r\nvain, and his heart was sore, for his courtiers and councillors were\r\nreally kind; only he could not think why none of their ladies came near\r\nhis princess.  The whole country was discontented, he heard, and there\r\nwere signs of gathering storm outside as well as inside his borders.\r\nThe master of the horse gave him sad news of the insubordination of the\r\narmy; and his great white horse was dead, they told him; and his sword\r\nhad lost its temper: it bent double the last time he tried it!--only\r\nperhaps that was in a dream; and they could not find his shield; and\r\none of his spurs had lost the rowel.\r\n\r\nThus the poor king went wandering in a maze of sorrows, some of which\r\nwere purely imaginary, while others were truer than he understood.  He\r\ntold how thieves came at night and tried to take his crown, so that he\r\nnever dared let it out of his hands even when he slept; and how, every\r\nnight, an evil demon in the shape of his physician came and poured\r\npoison down his throat.  He knew it to be poison, he said, somehow,\r\nalthough it tasted like wine.\r\n\r\nHere he stopped, faint with the unusual exertion of talking.\r\n\r\nCurdie seized the flagon, and ran to the wine cellar.\r\n\r\nIn the servants' hall the girl still sat by the fire, waiting for him.\r\nAs he returned he told her to follow him, and left her at the chamber\r\ndoor until he should rejoin her.  When the king had had a little wine,\r\nhe informed him that he had already discovered certain of His Majesty's\r\nenemies, and one of the worst of them was the doctor, for it was no\r\nother demon than the doctor himself who had been coming every night,\r\nand giving him a slow poison.\r\n\r\n'So!' said the king.  'Then I have not been suspicious enough, for I\r\nthought it was but a dream!  Is it possible Kelman can be such a\r\nwretch?  Who then am I to trust?'\r\n\r\n'Not one in the house, except the princess and myself,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'I will not go to sleep,' said the king.\r\n\r\n'That would be as bad as taking the poison,' said Curdie.  'No, no,\r\nsire; you must show your confidence by leaving all the watching to me,\r\nand doing all the sleeping Your Majesty can.'\r\n\r\nThe king smiled a contented smile, turned on his side, and was\r\npresently fast asleep.  Then Curdie persuaded the princess also to go\r\nto sleep, and telling Lina to watch, went to the housemaid.  He asked\r\nher if she could inform him which of the council slept in the palace,\r\nand show him their rooms.  She knew every one of them, she said, and\r\ntook him the round of all their doors, telling him which slept in each\r\nroom.  He then dismissed her, and returning to the king's chamber,\r\nseated himself behind a curtain at the head of the bed, on the side\r\nfarthest from the king.  He told Lina to get under the bed, and make no\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nAbout one o'clock the doctor came stealing in.  He looked round for the\r\nprincess, and seeing no one, smiled with satisfaction as he approached\r\nthe wine where it stood under the lamp.  Having partly filled a glass,\r\nhe took from his pocket a small phial, and filled up the glass from it.\r\nThe light fell upon his face from above, and Curdie saw the snake in it\r\nplainly visible.  He had never beheld such an evil countenance: the man\r\nhated the king, and delighted in doing him wrong.\r\n\r\nWith the glass in his hand, he drew near the bed, set it down, and\r\nbegan his usual rude rousing of His Majesty.  Not at once succeeding,\r\nhe took a lancet from his pocket, and was parting its cover with an\r\ninvoluntary hiss of hate between his closed teeth, when Curdie stooped\r\nand whispered to Lina.\r\n\r\n'Take him by the leg, Lina.'  She darted noiselessly upon him. With a\r\nface of horrible consternation, he gave his leg one tug to free it; the\r\nnext instant Curdie heard the one scrunch with which she crushed the\r\nbone like a stick of celery.  He tumbled on the floor with a yell.\r\n\r\n'Drag him out, Lina,' said Curdie. Lina took him by the collar, and\r\ndragged him out.  Her master followed her to direct her, and they left\r\nthe doctor lying across the lord chamberlain's door, where he gave\r\nanother horrible yell, and fainted.\r\n\r\nThe king had waked at his first cry, and by the time Curdie re-entered\r\nhe had got at his sword where it hung from the centre of the tester,\r\nhad drawn it, and was trying to get out of bed.  But when Curdie told\r\nhim all was well, he lay down again as quietly as a child comforted by\r\nhis mother from a troubled dream.  Curdie went to the door to watch.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's yells had aroused many, but not one had yet ventured to\r\nappear.  Bells were rung violently, but none were answered; and in a\r\nminute or two Curdie had what he was watching for.  The door of the\r\nlord chamberlain's room opened, and, pale with hideous terror, His\r\nLordship peeped out.  Seeing no one, he advanced to step into the\r\ncorridor, and tumbled over the doctor.  Curdie ran up, and held out his\r\nhand.  He received in it the claw of a bird of prey--vulture or eagle,\r\nhe could not tell which.\r\n\r\nHis Lordship, as soon as he was on his legs, taking him for one of the\r\npages abused him heartily for not coming sooner, and threatened him\r\nwith dismissal from the king's service for cowardice and neglect.  He\r\nbegan indeed what bade fair to be a sermon on the duties of a page, but\r\ncatching sight of the man who lay at his door, and seeing it was the\r\ndoctor, he fell upon Curdie afresh for standing there doing nothing,\r\nand ordered him to fetch immediate assistance.  Curdie left him, but\r\nslipped into the King's chamber, closed and locked the door, and left\r\nthe rascals to look after each other.  Ere long he heard hurrying\r\nfootsteps, and for a few minutes there was a great muffled tumult of\r\nscuffling feet, low voices and deep groanings; then all was still again.\r\n\r\nIrene slept through the whole--so confidently did she rest, knowing\r\nCurdie was in her father's room watching over him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24\r\n\r\nThe Prophecy\r\n\r\nCurdie sat and watched every motion of the sleeping king.  All the\r\nnight, to his ear, the palace lay as quiet as a nursery of healthful\r\nchildren.  At sunrise he called the princess.\r\n\r\n'How has His Majesty slept?' were her first words as she entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n'Quite quietly,' answered Curdie; 'that is, since the doctor was got\r\nrid of.'\r\n\r\n'How did you manage that?' inquired Irene; and Curdie had to tell all\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n'How terrible!' she said.  'Did it not startle the king dreadfully?'\r\n\r\n'It did rather.  I found him getting out of bed, sword in hand.'\r\n\r\n'The brave old man!' cried the princess.\r\n\r\n'Not so old!' said Curdie, 'as you will soon see.  He went off again in\r\na minute or so; but for a little while he was restless, and once when\r\nhe lifted his hand it came down on the spikes of his crown, and he half\r\nwaked.'\r\n\r\n'But where is the crown?' cried Irene, in sudden terror.\r\n\r\n'I stroked his hands,' answered Curdie, 'and took the crown from them;\r\nand ever since he has slept quietly, and again and again smiled in his\r\nsleep.'\r\n\r\n'I have never seen him do that,' said the princess.  'But what have you\r\ndone with the crown, Curdie?'\r\n\r\n'Look,' said Curdie, moving away from the bedside.\r\n\r\nIrene followed him--and there, in the middle of the floor, she saw a\r\nstrange sight.  Lina lay at full length, fast asleep, her tail\r\nstretched out straight behind her and her forelegs before her: between\r\nthe two paws meeting in front of it, her nose just touching it behind,\r\nglowed and flashed the crown, like a nest of the humming birds of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nIrene gazed, and looked up with a smile.\r\n\r\n'But what if the thief were to come, and she not to wake?' she said.\r\n'Shall I try her?'  And as she spoke she stooped toward the crown.\r\n\r\n'No, no, no!' cried Curdie, terrified.  'She would frighten you out of\r\nyour wits.  I would do it to show you, but she would wake your father.\r\nYou have no conception with what a roar she would spring at my throat.\r\nBut you shall see how lightly she wakes the moment I speak to her.\r\nLina!'\r\n\r\nShe was on her feet the same instant, with her great tail sticking out\r\nstraight behind her, just as it had been lying.\r\n\r\n'Good dog!' said the princess, and patted her head.  Lina wagged her\r\ntail solemnly, like the boom of an anchored sloop.  Irene took the\r\ncrown, and laid it where the king would see it when he woke.\r\n\r\n'Now, Princess,' said Curdie, 'I must leave you for a few minutes. You\r\nmust bolt the door, please, and not open it to any one.'\r\n\r\nAway to the cellar he went with Lina, taking care, as they passed\r\nthrough the servants' hall, to get her a good breakfast.  In about one\r\nminute she had eaten what he gave her, and looked up in his face: it\r\nwas not more she wanted, but work.  So out of the cellar they went\r\nthrough the passage, and Curdie into the dungeon, where he pulled up\r\nLina, opened the door, let her out, and shut it again behind her.  As\r\nhe reached the door of the king's chamber, Lina was flying out of the\r\ngate of Gwyntystorm as fast as her mighty legs could carry her.\r\n\r\n'What's come to the wench?' growled the menservants one to another,\r\nwhen the chambermaid appeared among them the next morning.  There was\r\nsomething in her face which they could not understand, and did not like.\r\n\r\n'Are we all dirt?' they said.  'What are you thinking about?  Have you\r\nseen yourself in the glass this morning, miss?'\r\n\r\nShe made no answer.\r\n\r\n'Do you want to be treated as you deserve, or will you speak, you\r\nhussy?' said the first woman-cook.  'I would fain know what right you\r\nhave to put on a face like that!'\r\n\r\n'You won't believe me,' said the girl.\r\n\r\n'Of course not.  What is it?'\r\n\r\n'I must tell you, whether you believe me or not,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Of course you must.'\r\n\r\n'It is this, then: if you do not repent of your bad ways, you are all\r\ngoing to be punished--all turned out of the palace together.'\r\n\r\n'A mighty punishment!' said the butler.  'A good riddance, say I, of\r\nthe trouble of keeping minxes like you in order!  And why, pray, should\r\nwe be turned out?  What have I to repent of now, your holiness?'\r\n\r\n'That you know best yourself,' said the girl.\r\n\r\n'A pretty piece of insolence!  How should I know, forsooth, what a\r\nmenial like you has got against me!  There are people in this\r\nhouse--oh! I'm not blind to their ways!--but every one for himself, say\r\nI!  Pray, Miss judgement, who gave you such an impertinent message to\r\nHis Majesty's household?'\r\n\r\n'One who is come to set things right in the king's house.'\r\n\r\n'Right, indeed!' cried the butler; but that moment the thought came\r\nback to him of the roar he had heard in the cellar, and he turned pale\r\nand was silent.\r\n\r\nThe steward took it up next.\r\n\r\n'And pray, pretty prophetess,' he said, attempting to chuck her under\r\nthe chin, 'what have I got to repent of?'\r\n\r\n'That you know best yourself,' said the girl.  'You have but to look\r\ninto your books or your heart.'\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me, then, what I have to repent of?' said the groom of\r\nthe chambers.  'That you know best yourself,' said the girl once more.\r\n'The person who told me to tell you said the servants of this house had\r\nto repent of thieving, and lying, and unkindness, and drinking; and\r\nthey will be made to repent of them one way, if they don't do it of\r\nthemselves another.'\r\n\r\nThen arose a great hubbub; for by this time all the servants in the\r\nhouse were gathered about her, and all talked together, in towering\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n'Thieving, indeed!' cried one.  'A pretty word in a house where\r\neverything is left lying about in a shameless way, tempting poor\r\ninnocent girls!  A house where nobody cares for anything, or has the\r\nleast respect to the value of property!'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you envy me this brooch of mine,' said another.  'There was\r\njust a half sheet of note paper about it, not a scrap more, in a drawer\r\nthat's always open in the writing table in the study! What sort of a\r\nplace is that for a jewel?  Can you call it stealing to take a thing\r\nfrom such a place as that?  Nobody cared a straw about it.  It might as\r\nwell have been in the dust hole!  If it had been locked up--then, to be\r\nsure!'\r\n\r\n'Drinking!' said the chief porter, with a husky laugh.  'And who\r\nwouldn't drink when he had a chance?  Or who would repent it, except\r\nthat the drink was gone?  Tell me that, Miss Innocence.'\r\n\r\n'Lying!' said a great, coarse footman.  'I suppose you mean when I told\r\nyou yesterday you were a pretty girl when you didn't pout? Lying,\r\nindeed!  Tell us something worth repenting of!  Lying is the way of\r\nGwyntystorm.  You should have heard Jabez lying to the cook last night!\r\nHe wanted a sweetbread for his pup, and pretended it was for the\r\nprincess!  Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n\r\n'Unkindness!  I wonder who's unkind!  Going and listening to any\r\nstranger against her fellow servants, and then bringing back his wicked\r\nwords to trouble them!' said the oldest and worst of the housemaids.\r\n'One of ourselves, too!  Come, you hypocrite!  This is all an invention\r\nof yours and your young man's, to take your revenge of us because we\r\nfound you out in a lie last night.  Tell true now: wasn't it the same\r\nthat stole the loaf and the pie that sent you with the impudent\r\nmessage?'\r\n\r\nAs she said this, she stepped up to the housemaid and gave her, instead\r\nof time to answer, a box on the ear that almost threw her down; and\r\nwhoever could get at her began to push and bustle and pinch and punch\r\nher.\r\n\r\n'You invite your fate,' she said quietly.\r\n\r\nThey fell furiously upon her, drove her from the hall with kicks and\r\nblows, hustled her along the passage, and threw her down the stair to\r\nthe wine cellar, then locked the door at the top of it, and went back\r\nto their breakfast.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the king and the princess had had their bread and wine,\r\nand the princess, with Curdie's help, had made the room as tidy as she\r\ncould--they were terribly neglected by the servants. And now Curdie set\r\nhimself to interest and amuse the king, and prevent him from thinking\r\ntoo much, in order that he might the sooner think the better.\r\nPresently, at His Majesty's request, he began from the beginning, and\r\ntold everything he could recall of his life, about his father and\r\nmother and their cottage on the mountain, of the inside of the mountain\r\nand the work there, about the goblins and his adventures with them.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to finding the princess and her nurse overtaken by the\r\ntwilight on the mountain, Irene took up her share of the tale, and told\r\nall about herself to that point, and then Curdie took it up again; and\r\nso they went on, each fitting in the part that the other did not know,\r\nthus keeping the hoop of the story running straight; and the king\r\nlistened with wondering and delighted ears, astonished to find what he\r\ncould so ill comprehend, yet fitting so well together from the lips of\r\ntwo narrators.\r\n\r\nAt last, with the mission given him by the wonderful princess and his\r\nconsequent adventures, Curdie brought up the whole tale to the present\r\nmoment.  Then a silence fell, and Irene and Curdie thought the king was\r\nasleep.  But he was far from it; he was thinking about many things.\r\nAfter a long pause he said:\r\n\r\n'Now at last, MY children, I am compelled to believe many things I\r\ncould not and do not yet understand--things I used to hear, and\r\nsometimes see, as often as I visited my mother's home.  Once, for\r\ninstance, I heard my mother say to her father--speaking of me--\"He is a\r\ngood, honest boy, but he will be an old man before he understands\"; and\r\nmy grandfather answered, \"Keep up your heart, child: my mother will\r\nlook after him.\"  I thought often of their words, and the many strange\r\nthings besides I both heard and saw in that house; but by degrees,\r\nbecause I could not understand them, I gave up thinking of them.  And\r\nindeed I had almost forgotten them, when you, my child, talking that\r\nday about the Queen Irene and her pigeons, and what you had seen in her\r\ngarret, brought them all back to my mind in a vague mass.  But now they\r\nkeep coming back to me, one by one, every one for itself; and I shall\r\njust hold my peace, and lie here quite still, and think about them all\r\ntill I get well again.'\r\n\r\nWhat he meant they could not quite understand, but they saw plainly\r\nthat already he was better.\r\n\r\n'Put away my crown,' he said.  'I am tired of seeing it, and have no\r\nmore any fear of its safety.'  They put it away together, withdrew from\r\nthe bedside, and left him in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25\r\n\r\nThe Avengers\r\n\r\nThere was nothing now to be dreaded from Dr Kelman, but it made Curdie\r\nanxious, as the evening drew near, to think that not a soul belonging\r\nto the court had been to visit the king, or ask how he did, that day.\r\nHe feared, in some shape or other, a more determined assault.  He had\r\nprovided himself a place in the room, to which he might retreat upon\r\napproach, and whence he could watch; but not once had he had to betake\r\nhimself to it.\r\n\r\nTowards night the king fell asleep.  Curdie thought more and more\r\nuneasily of the moment when he must again leave them for a little\r\nwhile.  Deeper and deeper fell the shadows.  No one came to light the\r\nlamp.  The princess drew her chair close to Curdie: she would rather it\r\nwere not so dark, she said.  She was afraid of something--she could not\r\ntell what; nor could she give any reason for her fear but that all was\r\nso dreadfully still.\r\n\r\nWhen it had been dark about an hour, Curdie thought Lina might have\r\nreturned; and reflected that the sooner he went the less danger was\r\nthere of any assault while he was away.  There was more risk of his own\r\npresence being discovered, no doubt, but things were now drawing to a\r\ncrisis, and it must be run.  So, telling the princess to lock all the\r\ndoors of the bedchamber, and let no one in, he took his mattock, and\r\nwith here a run, and there a halt under cover, gained the door at the\r\nhead of the cellar stair in safety.  To his surprise he found it\r\nlocked, and the key was gone.  There was no time for deliberation.  He\r\nfelt where the lock was, and dealt it a tremendous blow with his\r\nmattock.  It needed but a second to dash the door open.  Someone laid a\r\nhand on his arm.\r\n\r\n'Who is it?' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'I told you they wouldn't believe me, sir,' said the housemaid.  'I\r\nhave been here all day.'\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and said, 'You are a good, brave girl.  Now come with\r\nme, lest your enemies imprison you again.'\r\n\r\nHe took her to the cellar, locked the door, lighted a bit of candle,\r\ngave her a little wine, told her to wait there till he came, and went\r\nout the back way.\r\n\r\nSwiftly he swung himself up into the dungeon.  Lina had done her part.\r\nThe place was swarming with creatures--animal forms wilder and more\r\ngrotesque than ever ramped in nightmare dream.  Close by the hole,\r\nwaiting his coming, her green eyes piercing the gulf below, Lina had\r\nbut just laid herself down when he appeared.  All about the vault and\r\nup the slope of the rubbish heap lay and stood and squatted the\r\nforty-nine whose friendship Lina had conquered in the wood.  They all\r\ncame crowding about Curdie.\r\n\r\nHe must get them into the cellar as quickly as ever he could.  But when\r\nhe looked at the size of some of them, he feared it would be a long\r\nbusiness to enlarge the hole sufficiently to let them through.  At it\r\nhe rushed, hitting vigorously at the edge with his mattock.  At the\r\nvery first blow came a splash from the water beneath, but ere he could\r\nheave a third, a creature like a tapir, only that the grasping point of\r\nits proboscis was hard as the steel of Curdie's hammer, pushed him\r\ngently aside, making room for another creature, with a head like a\r\ngreat club, which it began banging upon the floor with terrible force\r\nand noise.  After about a minute of this battery, the tapir came up\r\nagain, shoved Clubhead aside, and putting its own head into the hole\r\nbegan gnawing at the sides of it with the finger of its nose, in such a\r\nfashion that the fragments fell in a continuous gravelly shower into\r\nthe water.  In a few minutes the opening was large enough for the\r\nbiggest creature among them to get through it.\r\n\r\nNext came the difficulty of letting them down: some were quite light,\r\nbut the half of them were too heavy for the rope, not to say for his\r\narms.  The creatures themselves seemed to be puzzling where or how they\r\nwere to go.  One after another of them came up, looked down through the\r\nhole, and drew back.  Curdie thought if he let Lina down, perhaps that\r\nwould suggest something; possibly they did not see the opening on the\r\nother side.  He did so, and Lina stood lighting up the entrance of the\r\npassage with her gleaming eyes.\r\n\r\nOne by one the creatures looked down again, and one by one they drew\r\nback, each standing aside to glance at the next, as if to say, Now you\r\nhave a look.  At last it came to the turn of the serpent with the long\r\nbody, the four short legs behind, and the little wings before.  No\r\nsooner had he poked his head through than he poked it farther\r\nthrough--and farther, and farther yet, until there was little more than\r\nhis legs left in the dungeon.  By that time he had got his head and\r\nneck well into the passage beside Lina.  Then his legs gave a great\r\nwaddle and spring, and he tumbled himself, far as there was betwixt\r\nthem, heels over head into the passage.\r\n\r\n'That is all very well for you, Mr Legserpent!' thought Curdie to\r\nhimself; 'but what is to be done with the rest?'  He had hardly time to\r\nthink it, however, before the creature's head appeared again through\r\nthe floor.  He caught hold of the bar of iron to which Curdie's rope\r\nwas tied, and settling it securely across the narrowest part of the\r\nirregular opening, held fast to it with his teeth.  It was plain to\r\nCurdie, from the universal hardness among them, that they must all, at\r\none time or another, have been creatures of the mines.\r\n\r\nHe saw at once what this one was after.  The beast had planted his feet\r\nfirmly upon the floor of the passage, and stretched his long body up\r\nand across the chasm to serve as a bridge for the rest. Curdie mounted\r\ninstantly upon his neck, threw his arms round him as far as they would\r\ngo, and slid down in ease and safety, the bridge just bending a little\r\nas his weight glided over it.  But he thought some of the creatures\r\nwould try the legserpent's teeth.\r\n\r\nOne by one the oddities followed, and slid down in safety.  When they\r\nseemed to be all landed, he counted them: there were but forty-eight.\r\nUp the rope again he went, and found one which had been afraid to trust\r\nhimself to the bridge, and no wonder! for he had neither legs nor head\r\nnor arms nor tail: he was just a round thing, about a foot in diameter,\r\nwith a nose and mouth and eyes on one side of the ball.  He had made\r\nhis journey by rolling as swiftly as the fleetest of them could run.\r\nThe back of the legserpent not being flat, he could not quite trust\r\nhimself to roll straight and not drop into the gulf.  Curdie took him\r\nin his arms, and the moment he looked down through the hole, the bridge\r\nmade itself again, and he slid into the passage in safety, with\r\nBallbody in his bosom.\r\n\r\nHe ran first to the cellar to warn the girl not to be frightened at the\r\navengers of wickedness.  Then he called to Lina to bring in her friends.\r\n\r\nOne after another they came trooping in, till the cellar seemed full of\r\nthem.  The housemaid regarded them without fear.\r\n\r\n'Sir,' she said, 'there is one of the pages I don't take to be a bad\r\nfellow.'\r\n\r\n'Then keep him near you,' said Curdie.  'And now can you show me a way\r\nto the king's chamber not through the servants' hall?'\r\n\r\n'There is a way through the chamber of the colonel of the guard,' she\r\nanswered, 'but he is ill, and in bed.'\r\n\r\n'Take me that way,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\nBy many ups and downs and windings and turnings she brought him to a\r\ndimly lighted room, where lay an elderly man asleep.  His arm was\r\noutside the coverlid, and Curdie gave his hand a hurried grasp as he\r\nwent by.  His heart beat for joy, for he had found a good, honest,\r\nhuman hand.\r\n\r\n'I suppose that is why he is ill,' he said to himself.\r\n\r\nIt was now close upon suppertime, and when the girl stopped at the door\r\nof the king's chamber, he told her to go and give the servants one\r\nwarning more.\r\n\r\n'Say the messenger sent you,' he said.  'I will be with you very soon.'\r\n\r\nThe king was still asleep.  Curdie talked to the princess for a few\r\nminutes, told her not to be frightened whatever noises she heard, only\r\nto keep her door locked till he came, and left her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 26\r\n\r\nThe Vengeance\r\n\r\nBy the time the girl reached the servants' hall they were seated at\r\nsupper.  A loud, confused exclamation arose when she entered.  No one\r\nmade room for her; all stared with unfriendly eyes.  A page, who\r\nentered the next minute by another door, came to her side.\r\n\r\n'Where do you come from, hussy?' shouted the butler, and knocked his\r\nfist on the table with a loud clang.\r\n\r\nHe had gone to fetch wine, had found the stair door broken open and the\r\ncellar door locked, and had turned and fled.  Among his fellows,\r\nhowever, he had now regained what courage could be called his.\r\n\r\n'From the cellar,' she replied.  'The messenger broke open the door,\r\nand sent me to you again.'\r\n\r\n'The messenger!  Pooh!  What messenger?'\r\n\r\n'The same who sent me before to tell you to repent.'\r\n\r\n'What!  Will you go fooling it still?  Haven't you had enough of it?'\r\ncried the butler in a rage, and starting to his feet, drew near\r\nthreateningly.\r\n\r\n'I must do as I am told,' said the girl.\r\n\r\n'Then why don't you do as I tell you, and hold your tongue?' said the\r\nbutler.  'Who wants your preachments?  If anybody here has anything to\r\nrepent Of, isn't that enough--and more than enough for him--but you\r\nmust come bothering about, and stirring up, till not a drop of quiet\r\nwill settle inside him?  You come along with me, young woman; we'll see\r\nif we can't find a lock somewhere in the house that'll hold you in!'\r\n\r\n'Hands off, Mr Butler!' said the page, and stepped between.\r\n\r\n'Oh, ho!' cried the butler, and pointed his fat finger at him. 'That's\r\nyou, is it, my fine fellow?  So it's you that's up to her tricks, is\r\nit?'\r\n\r\nThe youth did not answer, only stood with flashing eyes fixed on him,\r\nuntil, growing angrier and angrier, but not daring a step nearer, he\r\nburst out with a rude but quavering authority:\r\n\r\n'Leave the house, both of you!  Be off, or I'll have Mr Steward to talk\r\nto you.  Threaten your masters, indeed!  Out of the house with you, and\r\nshow us the way you tell us of!'\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the footmen got up and ranged themselves behind the\r\nbutler.\r\n\r\n'Don't say I threaten you, Mr Butler,' expostulated the girl from\r\nbehind the page.  'The messenger said I was to tell you again, and give\r\nyou one chance more.'\r\n\r\n'Did the messenger mention me in particular?' asked the butler, looking\r\nthe page unsteadily in the face.\r\n\r\n'No, sir,' answered the girl.\r\n\r\n'I thought not!  I should like to hear him!'\r\n\r\n'Then hear him now,' said Curdie, who that moment entered at the\r\nopposite corner of the hall.  'I speak of the butler in particular when\r\nI say that I know more evil of him than of any of the rest. He will not\r\nlet either his own conscience or my messenger speak to him: I therefore\r\nnow speak myself.  I proclaim him a villain, and a traitor to His\r\nMajesty the king.  But what better is any one of you who cares only for\r\nhimself, eats, drinks, takes good money, and gives vile service in\r\nreturn, stealing and wasting the king's property, and making of the\r\npalace, which ought to be an example of order and sobriety, a disgrace\r\nto the country?'\r\n\r\nFor a moment all stood astonished into silence by this bold speech from\r\na stranger.  True, they saw by his mattock over his shoulder that he\r\nwas nothing but a miner boy, yet for a moment the truth told\r\nnotwithstanding.  Then a great roaring laugh burst from the biggest of\r\nthe footmen as he came shouldering his way through the crowd toward\r\nCurdie.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I'm right,' he cried; 'I thought as much!  This messenger,\r\nforsooth, is nothing but a gallows bird--a fellow the city marshal was\r\ngoing to hang, but unfortunately put it off till he should be starved\r\nenough to save rope and be throttled with a pack thread. He broke\r\nprison, and here he is preaching!'  As he spoke, he stretched out his\r\ngreat hand to lay hold of him.  Curdie caught it in his left hand, and\r\nheaved his mattock with the other.  Finding, however, nothing worse\r\nthan an ox hoof, he restrained himself, stepped back a pace or two,\r\nshifted his mattock to his left hand, and struck him a little smart\r\nblow on the shoulder.  His arm dropped by his side, he gave a roar, and\r\ndrew back.\r\n\r\nHis fellows came crowding upon Curdie.  Some called to the dogs; others\r\nswore; the women screamed; the footmen and pages got round him in a\r\nhalf circle, which he kept from closing by swinging his mattock, and\r\nhere and there threatening a blow.\r\n\r\n'Whoever confesses to having done anything wrong in this house, however\r\nsmall, however great, and means to do better, let him come to this\r\ncorner of the room,' he cried.\r\n\r\nNone moved but the page, who went toward him skirting the wall. When\r\nthey caught sight of him, the crowd broke into a hiss of derision.\r\n\r\n'There!  See!  Look at the sinner!  He confesses!  Actually confesses!\r\nCome, what is it you stole?  The barefaced hypocrite! There's your sort\r\nto set up for reproving other people!  Where's the other now?'\r\n\r\nBut the maid had left the room, and they let the page pass, for he\r\nlooked dangerous to stop.  Curdie had just put him betwixt him and the\r\nwall, behind the door, when in rushed the butler with the huge kitchen\r\npoker, the point of which he had blown red-hot in the fire, followed by\r\nthe cook with his longest spit.  Through the crowd, which scattered\r\nright and left before them, they came down upon Curdie.  Uttering a\r\nshrill whistle, he caught the poker a blow with his mattock, knocking\r\nthe point to the ground, while the page behind him started forward, and\r\nseizing the point of the spit, held on to it with both hands, the cook\r\nkicking him furiously.\r\n\r\nEre the butler could raise the poker again, or the cook recover the\r\nspit, with a roar to terrify the dead, Lina dashed into the room, her\r\neyes flaming like candles.  She went straight at the butler. He was\r\ndown in a moment, and she on the top of him, wagging her tail over him\r\nlike a lioness.\r\n\r\n'Don't kill him, Lina,' said Curdie.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Mr Miner!' cried the butler.\r\n\r\n'Put your foot on his mouth, Lina,' said Curdie.  'The truth Fear tells\r\nis not much better than her lies.'\r\n\r\nThe rest of the creatures now came stalking, rolling, leaping, gliding,\r\nhobbling into the room, and each as he came took the next place along\r\nthe wall, until, solemn and grotesque, all stood ranged, awaiting\r\norders.\r\n\r\nAnd now some of the culprits were stealing to the doors nearest them.\r\nCurdie whispered to the two creatures next him.  Off went Ballbody,\r\nrolling and bounding through the crowd like a spent cannon shot, and\r\nwhen the foremost reached the door to the corridor, there he lay at the\r\nfoot of it grinning; to the other door scuttled a scorpion, as big as a\r\nhuge crab.  The rest stood so still that some began to think they were\r\nonly boys dressed up to look awful; they persuaded themselves they were\r\nonly another part of the housemaid's and page's vengeful contrivance,\r\nand their evil spirits began to rise again.  Meantime Curdie had, with\r\na second sharp blow from the hammer of his mattock, disabled the cook,\r\nso that he yielded the spit with a groan.  He now turned to the\r\navengers.\r\n\r\n'Go at them,' he said.\r\n\r\nThe whole nine-and-forty obeyed at once, each for himself, and after\r\nhis own fashion.  A scene of confusion and terror followed. The crowd\r\nscattered like a dance of flies.  The creatures had been instructed not\r\nto hurt much, but to hunt incessantly, until everyone had rushed from\r\nthe house.  The women shrieked, and ran hither and thither through the\r\nhall, pursued each by her own horror, and snapped at by every other in\r\npassing.  If one threw herself down in hysterical despair, she was\r\ninstantly poked or clawed or nibbled up again.\r\n\r\nThough they were quite as frightened at first, the men did not run so\r\nfast; and by and by some of them finding they were only glared at, and\r\nfollowed, and pushed, began to summon up courage once more, and with\r\ncourage came impudence.  The tapir had the big footman in charge: the\r\nfellow stood stock-still, and let the beast come up to him, then put\r\nout his finger and playfully patted his nose.  The tapir gave the nose\r\na little twist, and the finger lay on the floor.\r\n\r\nThen indeed did the footman run.\r\n\r\nGradually the avengers grew more severe, and the terrors of the\r\nimagination were fast yielding to those of sensuous experience, when a\r\npage, perceiving one of the doors no longer guarded, sprang at it, and\r\nran out.  Another and another followed.  Not a beast went after, until,\r\none by one, they were every one gone from the hall, and the whole crew\r\nin the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThere they were beginning to congratulate themselves that all was over,\r\nwhen in came the creatures trooping after them, and the second act of\r\ntheir terror and pain began.  They were flung about in all directions;\r\ntheir clothes were torn from them; they were pinched and scratched any-\r\nand everywhere; Ballbody kept rolling up them and over them, confining\r\nhis attentions to no one in particular; the scorpion kept grabbing at\r\ntheir legs with his huge pincers; a three-foot centipede kept screwing\r\nup their bodies, nipping as he went; varied as numerous were their\r\nwoes.  Nor was it long before the last of them had fled from the\r\nkitchen to the sculleries.\r\n\r\nBut thither also they were followed, and there again they were hunted\r\nabout.  They were bespattered with the dirt of their own neglect; they\r\nwere soused in the stinking water that had boiled greens; they were\r\nsmeared with rancid dripping; their faces were rubbed in maggots: I\r\ndare not tell all that was done to them.  At last they got the door\r\ninto a back yard open, and rushed out.  Then first they knew that the\r\nwind was howling and the rain falling in sheets.  But there was no rest\r\nfor them even there.  Thither also were they followed by the inexorable\r\navengers, and the only door here was a door out of the palace: out\r\nevery soul of them was driven, and left, some standing, some lying,\r\nsome crawling, to the farther buffeting of the waterspouts and\r\nwhirlwinds ranging every street of the city.  The door was flung to\r\nbehind them, and they heard it locked and bolted and barred against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 27\r\n\r\nMore Vengeance\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were gone, Curdie brought the creatures back to the\r\nservants' hall, and told them to eat up everything on the table. It was\r\na sight to see them all standing round it--except such as had to get\r\nupon it--eating and drinking, each after its fashion, without a smile,\r\nor a word, or a glance of fellowship in the act. A very few moments\r\nserved to make everything eatable vanish, and then Curdie requested\r\nthem to clean house, and the page who stood by to assist them.\r\n\r\nEvery one set about it except Ballbody: he could do nothing at\r\ncleaning, for the more he rolled, the more he spread the dirt. Curdie\r\nwas curious to know what he had been, and how he had come to be such as\r\nhe was: but he could only conjecture that he was a gluttonous alderman\r\nwhom nature had treated homeopathically. And now there was such a\r\ncleaning and clearing out of neglected places, such a burying and\r\nburning of refuse, such a rinsing of jugs, such a swilling of sinks,\r\nand such a flushing of drains as would have delighted the eyes of all\r\ntrue housekeepers and lovers of cleanliness generally.\r\n\r\nCurdie meantime was with the king, telling him all he had done. They\r\nhad heard a little noise, but not much, for he had told the avengers to\r\nrepress outcry as much as possible; and they had seen to it that the\r\nmore anyone cried out the more he had to cry out upon, while the\r\npatient ones they scarcely hurt at all.\r\n\r\nHaving promised His Majesty and Her Royal Highness a good breakfast,\r\nCurdie now went to finish the business.  The courtiers must be dealt\r\nwith.  A few who were the worst, and the leaders of the rest, must be\r\nmade examples of; the others should be driven to the street.\r\n\r\nHe found the chiefs of the conspiracy holding a final consultation in\r\nthe smaller room off the hall.  These were the lord chamberlain, the\r\nattorney-general, the master of the horse, and the king's private\r\nsecretary: the lord chancellor and the rest, as foolish as faithless,\r\nwere but the tools of these.\r\n\r\nThe housemaid had shown him a little closet, opening from a passage\r\nbehind, where he could overhear all that passed in that room; and now\r\nCurdie heard enough to understand that they had determined, in the dead\r\nof that night, rather in the deepest dark before the morning, to bring\r\na certain company of soldiers into the palace, make away with the king,\r\nsecure the princess, announce the sudden death of His Majesty, read as\r\nhis the will they had drawn up, and proceed to govern the country at\r\ntheir ease, and with results: they would at once levy severer taxes,\r\nand pick a quarrel with the most powerful of their neighbours.\r\nEverything settled, they agreed to retire, and have a few hours' quiet\r\nsleep first--all but the secretary, who was to sit up and call them at\r\nthe proper moment. Curdie allowed them half an hour to get to bed, and\r\nthen set about completing his purgation of the palace.\r\n\r\nFirst he called Lina, and opened the door of the room where the\r\nsecretary sat.  She crept in, and laid herself down against it. When\r\nthe secretary, rising to stretch his legs, caught sight of her eyes, he\r\nstood frozen with terror.  She made neither motion nor sound.\r\nGathering courage, and taking the thing for a spectral illusion, he\r\nmade a step forward.  She showed her other teeth, with a growl neither\r\nmore than audible nor less than horrible.  The secretary sank fainting\r\ninto a chair.  He was not a brave man, and besides, his conscience had\r\ngone over to the enemy, and was sitting against the door by Lina.\r\n\r\nTo the lord chamberlain's door next, Curdie conducted the legserpent,\r\nand let him in.\r\n\r\nNow His Lordship had had a bedstead made for himself, sweetly fashioned\r\nof rods of silver gilt: upon it the legserpent found him asleep, and\r\nunder it he crept.  But out he came on the other side, and crept over\r\nit next, and again under it, and so over it, under it, over it, five or\r\nsix times, every time leaving a coil of himself behind him, until he\r\nhad softly folded all his length about the lord chamberlain and his\r\nbed.  This done, he set up his head, looking down with curved neck\r\nright over His Lordship's, and began to hiss in his face.\r\n\r\nHe woke in terror unspeakable, and would have started up but the moment\r\nhe moved, the legserpent drew his coils closer, and closer still, and\r\ndrew and drew until the quaking traitor heard the joints of his\r\nbedstead grinding and gnarring.  Presently he persuaded himself that it\r\nwas only a horrid nightmare, and began to struggle with all his\r\nstrength to throw it off.  Thereupon the legserpent gave his hooked\r\nnose such a bite that his teeth met through it--but it was hardly\r\nthicker than the bowl of a spoon; and then the vulture knew that he was\r\nin the grasp of his enemy the snake, and yielded.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was quiet the legserpent began to untwist and retwist, to\r\nuncoil and recoil himself, swinging and swaying, knotting and relaxing\r\nhimself with strangest curves and convolutions, always, however,\r\nleaving at least one coil around his victim.  At last he undid himself\r\nentirely, and crept from the bed. Then first the lord chamberlain\r\ndiscovered that his tormentor had bent and twisted the bedstead, legs\r\nand canopy and all, so about him that he was shut in a silver cage out\r\nof which it was impossible for him to find a way.  Once more, thinking\r\nhis enemy was gone, he began to shout for help.  But the instant he\r\nopened his mouth his keeper darted at him and bit him, and after three\r\nor four such essays, he lay still.\r\n\r\nThe master of the horse Curdie gave in charge to the tapir.  When the\r\nsoldier saw him enter--for he was not yet asleep--he sprang from his\r\nbed, and flew at him with his sword.  But the creature's hide was\r\ninvulnerable to his blows, and he pecked at his legs with his proboscis\r\nuntil he jumped into bed again, groaning, and covered himself up; after\r\nwhich the tapir contented himself with now and then paying a visit to\r\nhis toes.\r\n\r\nAs for the attorney-general, Curdie led to his door a huge spider,\r\nabout two feet long in the body, which, having made an excellent\r\nsupper, was full of webbing.  The attorney-general had not gone to bed,\r\nbut sat in a chair asleep before a great mirror.  He had been trying\r\nthe effect of a diamond star which he had that morning taken from the\r\njewel room.  When he woke he fancied himself paralysed; every limb,\r\nevery finger even, was motionless: coils and coils of broad spider\r\nribbon bandaged his members to his body, and all to the chair.  In the\r\nglass he saw himself wound about with slavery infinite.  On a footstool\r\na yard off sat the spider glaring at him.\r\n\r\nClubhead had mounted guard over the butler, where he lay tied hand and\r\nfoot under the third cask.  From that cask he had seen the wine run\r\ninto a great bath, and therein he expected to be drowned.  The doctor,\r\nwith his crushed leg, needed no one to guard him.\r\n\r\nAnd now Curdie proceeded to the expulsion of the rest.  Great men or\r\nunderlings, he treated them all alike.  From room to room over the\r\nhouse he went, and sleeping or waking took the man by the hand. Such\r\nwas the state to which a year of wicked rule had reduced the moral\r\ncondition of the court, that in it all he found but three with human\r\nhands.  The possessors of these he allowed to dress themselves and\r\ndepart in peace.  When they perceived his mission, and how he was\r\nbacked, they yielded.\r\n\r\nThen commenced a general hunt, to clear the house of the vermin. Out of\r\ntheir beds in their night clothing, out of their rooms, gorgeous\r\nchambers or garret nooks, the creatures hunted them.  Not one was\r\nallowed to escape.  Tumult and noise there was little, for fear was too\r\ndeadly for outcry.  Ferreting them out everywhere, following them\r\nupstairs and downstairs, yielding no instant of repose except upon the\r\nway out, the avengers persecuted the miscreants, until the last of them\r\nwas shivering outside the palace gates, with hardly sense enough left\r\nto know where to turn.\r\n\r\nWhen they set out to look for shelter, they found every inn full of the\r\nservants expelled before them, and not one would yield his place to a\r\nsuperior suddenly levelled with himself.  Most houses refused to admit\r\nthem on the ground of the wickedness that must have drawn on them such\r\na punishment; and not a few would have been left in the streets all\r\nnight, had not Derba, roused by the vain entreaties at the doors on\r\neach side of her cottage, opened hers, and given up everything to them.\r\nThe lord chancellor was only too glad to share a mattress with a\r\nstableboy, and steal his bare feet under his jacket.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Curdie appeared, and the outcasts were in terror,\r\nthinking he had come after them again.  But he took no notice of them:\r\nhis object was to request Derba to go to the palace: the king required\r\nher services.  She need take no trouble about her cottage, he said; the\r\npalace was henceforward her home: she was the king's chatelaine over\r\nmen and maidens of his household.  And this very morning she must cook\r\nHis Majesty a nice breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 28\r\n\r\nThe Preacher\r\n\r\nVarious reports went undulating through the city as to the nature of\r\nwhat had taken place in the palace.  The people gathered, and stared at\r\nthe house, eyeing it as if it had sprung up in the night. But it looked\r\nsedate enough, remaining closed and silent, like a house that was dead.\r\nThey saw no one come out or go in.  Smoke arose from a chimney or two;\r\nthere was hardly another sign of life. It was not for some little time\r\ngenerally understood that the highest officers of the crown as well as\r\nthe lowest menials of the palace had been dismissed in disgrace: for\r\nwho was to recognize a lord chancellor in his nightshirt?  And what\r\nlord chancellor would, so attired in the street, proclaim his rank and\r\noffice aloud? Before it was day most of the courtiers crept down to the\r\nriver, hired boats, and betook themselves to their homes or their\r\nfriends in the country.  It was assumed in the city that the domestics\r\nhad been discharged upon a sudden discovery of general and unpardonable\r\npeculation; for, almost everybody being guilty of it himself, petty\r\ndishonesty was the crime most easily credited and least easily passed\r\nover in Gwyntystorm.\r\n\r\nNow that same day was Religion day, and not a few of the clergy, always\r\nglad to seize on any passing event to give interest to the dull and\r\nmonotonic grind of their intellectual machines, made this remarkable\r\none the ground of discourse to their congregations. More especially\r\nthan the rest, the first priest of the great temple where was the royal\r\npew, judged himself, from his relation to the palace, called upon to\r\n'improve the occasion', for they talked ever about improvement at\r\nGwyntystorm, all the time they were going down hill with a rush.\r\n\r\nThe book which had, of late years, come to be considered the most\r\nsacred, was called The Book of Nations, and consisted of proverbs, and\r\nhistory traced through custom: from it the first priest chose his text;\r\nand his text was, 'Honesty Is the Best Policy.'  He was considered a\r\nvery eloquent man, but I can offer only a few of the larger bones of\r\nhis sermon.\r\n\r\nThe main proof of the verity of their religion, he said, was that\r\nthings always went well with those who profess it; and its first\r\nfundamental principle, grounded in inborn invariable instinct, was,\r\nthat every One should take care of that One.  This was the first duty\r\nof Man.  If every one would but obey this law, number one, then would\r\nevery one be perfectly cared for--one being always equal to one.  But\r\nthe faculty of care was in excess of need, and all that overflowed, and\r\nwould otherwise run to waste, ought to be gently turned in the\r\ndirection of one's neighbour, seeing that this also wrought for the\r\nfulfilling of the law, inasmuch as the reaction of excess so directed\r\nwas upon the director of the same, to the comfort, that is, and\r\nwell-being of the original self.  To be just and friendly was to build\r\nthe warmest and safest of all nests, and to be kind and loving was to\r\nline it with the softest of all furs and feathers, for the one\r\nprecious, comfort-loving self there to lie, revelling in downiest\r\nbliss.  One of the laws therefore most binding upon men because of its\r\nrelation to the first and greatest of all duties, was embodied in the\r\nProverb he had just read; and what stronger proof of its wisdom and\r\ntruth could they desire than the sudden and complete vengeance which\r\nhad fallen upon those worse than ordinary sinners who had offended\r\nagainst the king's majesty by forgetting that 'Honesty Is the Best\r\nPolicy'?\r\n\r\nAt this point of the discourse the head of the legserpent rose from the\r\nfloor of the temple, towering above the pulpit, above the priest, then\r\ncurving downward, with open mouth slowly descended upon him.  Horror\r\nfroze the sermon-pump.  He stared upward aghast. The great teeth of the\r\nanimal closed upon a mouthful of the sacred vestments, and slowly he\r\nlifted the preacher from the pulpit, like a handful of linen from a\r\nwashtub, and, on his four solemn stumps, bore him out of the temple,\r\ndangling aloft from his jaws.  At the back of it he dropped him into\r\nthe dust hole among the remnants of a library whose age had destroyed\r\nits value in the eyes of the chapter.  They found him burrowing in it,\r\na lunatic henceforth--whose madness presented the peculiar feature,\r\nthat in its paroxysms he jabbered sense.\r\n\r\nBone-freezing horror pervaded Gwyntystorm.  If their best and wisest\r\nwere treated with such contempt, what might not the rest of them look\r\nfor?  Alas for their city!  Their grandly respectable city!  Their\r\nloftily reasonable city!  Where it was all to end, who could tell!\r\n\r\nBut something must be done.  Hastily assembling, the priests chose a\r\nnew first priest, and in full conclave unanimously declared and\r\naccepted that the king in his retirement had, through the practice of\r\nthe blackest magic, turned the palace into a nest of demons in the\r\nmidst of them.  A grand exorcism was therefore indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the fact came out that the greater part of the\r\ncourtiers had been dismissed as well as the servants, and this fact\r\nswelled the hope of the Party of Decency, as they called themselves.\r\nUpon it they proceeded to act, and strengthened themselves on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe action of the king's bodyguard remained for a time uncertain. But\r\nwhen at length its officers were satisfied that both the master of the\r\nhorse and their colonel were missing, they placed themselves under the\r\norders of the first priest.\r\n\r\nEvery one dated the culmination of the evil from the visit of the miner\r\nand his mongrel; and the butchers vowed, if they could but get hold of\r\nthem again, they would roast both of them alive.  At once they formed\r\nthemselves into a regiment, and put their dogs in training for attack.\r\n\r\nIncessant was the talk, innumerable were the suggestions, and great was\r\nthe deliberation.  The general consent, however, was that as soon as\r\nthe priests should have expelled the demons, they would depose the\r\nking, and attired in all his regal insignia, shut him in a cage for\r\npublic show; then choose governors, with the lord chancellor at their\r\nhead, whose first duty should be to remit every possible tax; and the\r\nmagistrates, by the mouth of the city marshal, required all able-bodied\r\ncitizens, in order to do their part toward the carrying out of these\r\nand a multitude of other reforms, to be ready to take arms at the first\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\nThings needful were prepared as speedily as possible, and a mighty\r\nceremony, in the temple, in the market place, and in front of the\r\npalace, was performed for the expulsion of the demons.  This over, the\r\nleaders retired to arrange an attack upon the palace.\r\n\r\nBut that night events occurred which, proving the failure of their\r\nfirst, induced the abandonment of their second, intent.  Certain of the\r\nprowling order of the community, whose numbers had of late been\r\nsteadily on the increase, reported frightful things.  Demons of\r\nindescribable ugliness had been espied careering through the midnight\r\nstreets and courts.  A citizen--some said in the very act of\r\nhousebreaking, but no one cared to look into trifles at such a\r\ncrisis--had been seized from behind, he could not see by what, and\r\nsoused in the river.  A well-known receiver of stolen goods had had his\r\nshop broken open, and when he came down in the morning had found\r\neverything in ruin on the pavement.  The wooden image of justice over\r\nthe door of the city marshal had had the arm that held the sword bitten\r\noff.  The gluttonous magistrate had been pulled from his bed in the\r\ndark, by beings of which he could see nothing but the flaming eyes, and\r\ntreated to a bath of the turtle soup that had been left simmering by\r\nthe side of the kitchen fire.  Having poured it over him, they put him\r\nagain into his bed, where he soon learned how a mummy must feel in its\r\ncerements.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, in the market place was fixed up a paper, with the king's\r\nown signature, to the effect that whoever henceforth should show\r\ninhospitality to strangers, and should be convicted of the same, should\r\nbe instantly expelled the city; while a second, in the butchers'\r\nquarter, ordained that any dog which henceforth should attack a\r\nstranger should be immediately destroyed.  It was plain, said the\r\nbutchers, that the clergy were of no use; they could not exorcise\r\ndemons!  That afternoon, catching sight of a poor old fellow in rags\r\nand tatters, quietly walking up the street, they hounded their dogs\r\nupon him, and had it not been that the door of Derba's cottage was\r\nstanding open, and was near enough for him to dart in and shut it ere\r\nthey reached him, he would have been torn in pieces.\r\n\r\nAnd thus things went on for some days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 29\r\n\r\nBarbara\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, with Derba to minister to his wants, with Curdie to\r\nprotect him, and Irene to nurse him, the king was getting rapidly\r\nstronger.  Good food was what he most wanted and of that, at least of\r\ncertain kinds of it, there was plentiful store in the palace.\r\nEverywhere since the cleansing of the lower regions of it, the air was\r\nclean and sweet, and under the honest hands of the one housemaid the\r\nking's chamber became a pleasure to his eyes.  With such changes it was\r\nno wonder if his heart grew lighter as well as his brain clearer.\r\n\r\nBut still evil dreams came and troubled him, the lingering result of\r\nthe wicked medicines the doctor had given him.  Every night, sometimes\r\ntwice or thrice, he would wake up in terror, and it would be minutes\r\nere he could come to himself.  The consequence was that he was always\r\nworse in the morning, and had loss to make up during the day.  While he\r\nslept, Irene or Curdie, one or the other, must still be always by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nOne night, when it was Curdie's turn with the king, he heard a cry\r\nsomewhere in the house, and as there was no other child, concluded,\r\nnotwithstanding the distance of her grandmother's room, that it must be\r\nBarbara.  Fearing something might be wrong, and noting the king's sleep\r\nmore quiet than usual, he ran to see.  He found the child in the middle\r\nof the floor, weeping bitterly, and Derba slumbering peacefully in bed.\r\nThe instant she saw him the night-lost thing ceased her crying, smiled,\r\nand stretched out her arms to him.  Unwilling to wake the old woman,\r\nwho had been working hard all day, he took the child, and carried her\r\nwith him.  She clung to him so, pressing her tear-wet radiant face\r\nagainst his, that her little arms threatened to choke him.\r\n\r\nWhen he re-entered the chamber, he found the king sitting up in bed,\r\nfighting the phantoms of some hideous dream.  Generally upon such\r\noccasions, although he saw his watcher, he could not dissociate him\r\nfrom the dream, and went raving on.  But the moment his eyes fell upon\r\nlittle Barbara, whom he had never seen before, his soul came into them\r\nwith a rush, and a smile like the dawn of an eternal day overspread his\r\ncountenance; the dream was nowhere, and the child was in his heart.  He\r\nstretched out his arms to her, the child stretched out hers to him, and\r\nin five minutes they were both asleep, each in the other's embrace.\r\n\r\nFrom that night Barbara had a crib in the king's chamber, and as often\r\nas he woke, Irene or Curdie, whichever was watching, took the sleeping\r\nchild and laid her in his arms, upon which, invariably and instantly,\r\nthe dream would vanish.  A great part of the day too she would be\r\nplaying on or about the king's bed; and it was a delight to the heart\r\nof the princess to see her amusing herself with the crown, now sitting\r\nupon it, now rolling it hither and thither about the room like a hoop.\r\nHer grandmother entering once while she was pretending to make porridge\r\nin it, held up her hands in horror-struck amazement; but the king would\r\nnot allow her to interfere, for the king was now Barbara's playmate,\r\nand his crown their plaything.\r\n\r\nThe colonel of the guard also was growing better.  Curdie went often to\r\nsee him.  They were soon friends, for the best people understand each\r\nother the easiest, and the grim old warrior loved the miner boy as if\r\nhe were at once his son and his angel.  He was very anxious about his\r\nregiment.  He said the officers were mostly honest men, he believed,\r\nbut how they might be doing without him, or what they might resolve, in\r\nignorance of the real state of affairs, and exposed to every\r\nmisrepresentation, who could tell? Curdie proposed that he should send\r\nfor the major, offering to be the messenger.  The colonel agreed, and\r\nCurdie went--not without his mattock, because of the dogs.\r\n\r\nBut the officers had been told by the master of the horse that their\r\ncolonel was dead, and although they were amazed he should be buried\r\nwithout the attendance of his regiment, they never doubted the\r\ninformation.  The handwriting itself of their colonel was insufficient,\r\ncounteracted by the fresh reports daily current, to destroy the lie.\r\nThe major regarded the letter as a trap for the next officer in\r\ncommand, and sent his orderly to arrest the messenger.  But Curdie had\r\nhad the wisdom not to wait for an answer.\r\n\r\nThe king's enemies said that he had first poisoned the good colonel of\r\nthe guard, and then murdered the master of the horse, and other\r\nfaithful councillors; and that his oldest and most attached domestics\r\nhad but escaped from the palace with their lives--not all of them, for\r\nthe butler was missing.  Mad or wicked, he was not only unfit to rule\r\nany longer, but worse than unfit to have in his power and under his\r\ninfluence the young princess, only hope of Gwyntystorm and the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe moment the lord chancellor reached his house in the country and had\r\ngot himself clothed, he began to devise how yet to destroy his master;\r\nand the very next morning set out for the neighbouring kingdom of\r\nBorsagrass to invite invasion, and offer a compact with its monarch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 30\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\nAt the cottage in the mountain everything for a time went on just as\r\nbefore.  It was indeed dull without Curdie, but as often as they looked\r\nat the emerald it was gloriously green, and with nothing to fear or\r\nregret, and everything to hope, they required little comforting.  One\r\nmorning, however, at last, Peter, who had been consulting the gem,\r\nrather now from habit than anxiety, as a farmer his barometer in\r\nundoubtful weather, turned suddenly to his wife, the stone in his hand,\r\nand held it up with a look of ghastly dismay.\r\n\r\n'Why, that's never the emerald!' said Joan.\r\n\r\n'It is,' answered Peter; 'but it were small blame to any one that took\r\nit for a bit of bottle glass!'\r\n\r\nFor, all save one spot right in the centre, of intensest and most\r\nbrilliant green, it looked as if the colour had been burnt out of it.\r\n\r\n'Run, run, Peter!' cried his wife.  'Run and tell the old princess.  It\r\nmay not be too late.  The boy must be lying at death's door.'\r\n\r\nWithout a word Peter caught up his mattock, darted from the cottage,\r\nand was at the bottom of the hill in less time than he usually took to\r\nget halfway.\r\n\r\nThe door of the king's house stood open; he rushed in and up the stair.\r\nBut after wandering about in vain for an hour, opening door after door,\r\nand finding no way farther up, the heart of the old man had well-nigh\r\nfailed him.  Empty rooms, empty rooms!--desertion and desolation\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nAt last he did come upon the door to the tower stair.  Up he darted.\r\nArrived at the top, he found three doors, and, one after the other,\r\nknocked at them all.  But there was neither voice nor hearing.  Urged\r\nby his faith and his dread, slowly, hesitatingly, he opened one.  It\r\nrevealed a bare garret room, nothing in it but one chair and one\r\nspinning wheel.  He closed it, and opened the next--to start back in\r\nterror, for he saw nothing but a great gulf, a moonless night, full of\r\nstars, and, for all the stars, dark, dark!--a fathomless abyss.  He\r\nopened the third door, and a rush like the tide of a living sea invaded\r\nhis ears.  Multitudinous wings flapped and flashed in the sun, and,\r\nlike the ascending column from a volcano, white birds innumerable shot\r\ninto the air, darkening the day with the shadow of their cloud, and\r\nthen, with a sharp sweep, as if bent sideways by a sudden wind, flew\r\nnorthward, swiftly away, and vanished.  The place felt like a tomb.\r\nThere seemed no breath of life left in it.\r\n\r\nDespair laid hold upon him; he rushed down thundering with heavy feet.\r\nOut upon him darted the housekeeper like an ogress-spider, and after\r\nher came her men; but Peter rushed past them, heedless and\r\ncareless--for had not the princess mocked him?--and sped along the road\r\nto Gwyntystorm.  What help lay in a miner's mattock, a man's arm, a\r\nfather's heart, he would bear to his boy.\r\n\r\nJoan sat up all night waiting his return, hoping and hoping.  The\r\nmountain was very still, and the sky was clear; but all night long the\r\nminer sped northward, and the heart of his wife was troubled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 31\r\n\r\nThe Sacrifice\r\n\r\nThings in the palace were in a strange condition: the king playing with\r\na child and dreaming wise dreams, waited upon by a little princess with\r\nthe heart of a queen, and a youth from the mines, who went nowhere, not\r\neven into the king's chamber, without his mattock on his shoulder and a\r\nhorrible animal at his heels; in a room nearby the colonel of his\r\nguard, also in bed, without a soldier to obey him; in six other rooms,\r\nfar apart, six miscreants, each watched by a beast-jailer; ministers to\r\nthem all, an old woman and a page; and in the wine cellar, forty-three\r\nanimals, creatures more grotesque than ever brain of man invented.\r\nNone dared approach its gates, and seldom one issued from them.\r\n\r\nAll the dwellers in the city were united in enmity to the palace. It\r\nswarmed with evil spirits, they said, whereas the evil spirits were in\r\nthe city, unsuspected.  One consequence of their presence was that,\r\nwhen the rumour came that a great army was on the march against\r\nGwyntystorm, instead of rushing to their defences, to make new gates,\r\nfree portcullises and drawbridges, and bar the river, each band flew\r\nfirst to their treasures, burying them in their cellars and gardens,\r\nand hiding them behind stones in their chimneys; and, next to\r\nrebellion, signing an invitation to His Majesty of Borsagrass to enter\r\nat their open gates, destroy their king, and annex their country to his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe straits of isolation were soon found in the palace: its invalids\r\nwere requiring stronger food, and what was to be done? For if the\r\nbutchers sent meat to the palace, was it not likely enough to be\r\npoisoned?  Curdie said to Derba he would think of some plan before\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBut that same night, as soon as it was dark, Lina came to her master,\r\nand let him understand she wanted to go out.  He unlocked a little\r\nprivate postern for her, left it so that she could push it open when\r\nshe returned, and told the crocodile to stretch himself across it\r\ninside.  Before midnight she came back with a young deer.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the legserpent crept out of the wine cellar,\r\nthrough the broken door behind, shot into the river, and soon appeared\r\nin the kitchen with a splendid sturgeon.  Every night Lina went out\r\nhunting, and every morning Legserpent went out fishing, and both\r\ninvalids and household had plenty to eat.  As to news, the page, in\r\nplain clothes, would now and then venture out into the market place,\r\nand gather some.\r\n\r\nOne night he came back with the report that the army of the king of\r\nBorsagrass had crossed the border.  Two days after, he brought the news\r\nthat the enemy was now but twenty miles from Gwyntystorm.\r\n\r\nThe colonel of the guard rose, and began furbishing his armour--but\r\ngave it over to the page, and staggered across to the barracks, which\r\nwere in the next street.  The sentry took him for a ghost or worse, ran\r\ninto the guardroom, bolted the door, and stopped his ears.  The poor\r\ncolonel, who was yet hardly able to stand, crawled back despairing.\r\n\r\nFor Curdie, he had already, as soon as the first rumour reached him,\r\nresolved, if no other instructions came, and the king continued unable\r\nto give orders, to call Lina and the creatures, and march to meet the\r\nenemy.  If he died, he died for the right, and there was a right end of\r\nit.  He had no preparations to make, except a good sleep.\r\n\r\nHe asked the king to let the housemaid take his place by His Majesty\r\nthat night, and went and lay down on the floor of the corridor, no\r\nfarther off than a whisper would reach from the door of the chamber.\r\nThere, with an old mantle of the king's thrown over him, he was soon\r\nfast asleep.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about the middle of the night, he woke suddenly, started to\r\nhis feet, and rubbed his eyes.  He could not tell what had waked him.\r\nBut could he be awake, or was he not dreaming?  The curtain of the\r\nking's door, a dull red ever before, was glowing a gorgeous, a radiant\r\npurple; and the crown wrought upon it in silks and gems was flashing as\r\nif it burned!  What could it mean?  Was the king's chamber on fire?  He\r\ndarted to the door and lifted the curtain. Glorious terrible sight!\r\n\r\nA long and broad marble table, that stood at one end of the room, had\r\nbeen drawn into the middle of it, and thereon burned a great fire, of a\r\nsort that Curdie knew--a fire of glowing, flaming roses, red and white.\r\nIn the midst of the roses lay the king, moaning, but motionless.  Every\r\nrose that fell from the table to the floor, someone, whom Curdie could\r\nnot plainly see for the brightness, lifted and laid burning upon the\r\nking's face, until at length his face too was covered with the live\r\nroses, and he lay all within the fire, moaning still, with now and then\r\na shuddering sob.\r\n\r\nAnd the shape that Curdie saw and could not see, wept over the king as\r\nhe lay in the fire, and often she hid her face in handfuls of her\r\nshadowy hair, and from her hair the water of her weeping dropped like\r\nsunset rain in the light of the roses.  At last she lifted a great\r\narmful of her hair, and shook it over the fire, and the drops fell from\r\nit in showers, and they did not hiss in the flames, but there arose\r\ninstead as it were the sound of running brooks.\r\n\r\nAnd the glow of the red fire died away, and the glow of the white fire\r\ngrew grey, and the light was gone, and on the table all was\r\nblack--except the face of the king, which shone from under the burnt\r\nroses like a diamond in the ashes of a furnace.\r\n\r\nThen Curdie, no longer dazzled, saw and knew the old princess.  The\r\nroom was lighted with the splendour of her face, of her blue eyes, of\r\nher sapphire crown.  Her golden hair went streaming out from her\r\nthrough the air till it went off in mist and light.  She was large and\r\nstrong as a Titaness.  She stooped over the table-altar, put her mighty\r\narms under the living sacrifice, lifted the king, as if he were but a\r\nlittle child, to her bosom, walked with him up the floor, and laid him\r\nin his bed.  Then darkness fell.\r\n\r\nThe miner boy turned silent away, and laid himself down again in the\r\ncorridor.  An absolute joy filled his heart, his bosom, his head, his\r\nwhole body.  All was safe; all was well.  With the helve of his mattock\r\ntight in his grasp, he sank into a dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 32\r\n\r\nThe King's Army\r\n\r\nHe woke like a giant refreshed with wine.\r\n\r\nWhen he went into the king's chamber, the housemaid sat where he had\r\nleft her, and everything in the room was as it had been the night\r\nbefore, save that a heavenly odour of roses filled the air of it.  He\r\nwent up to the bed.  The king opened his eyes, and the soul of perfect\r\nhealth shone out of them.  Nor was Curdie amazed in his delight.\r\n\r\n'Is it not time to rise, Curdie?' said the king.\r\n\r\n'It is, Your Majesty.  Today we must be doing,' answered Curdie.\r\n\r\n'What must we be doing today, Curdie?'\r\n\r\n'Fighting, sire.'\r\n\r\n'Then fetch me my armour--that of plated steel, in the chest there.\r\nYou will find the underclothing with it.'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he reached out his hand for his sword, which hung in the\r\nbed before him, drew it, and examined the blade.\r\n\r\n'A little rusty!' he said, 'but the edge is there.  We shall polish it\r\nourselves today--not on the wheel.  Curdie, my son, I wake from a\r\ntroubled dream.  A glorious torture has ended it, and I live.  I know\r\nnow well how things are, but you shall explain them to me as I get on\r\nmy armour.  No, I need no bath.  I am clean.  Call the colonel of the\r\nguard.'\r\n\r\nIn complete steel the old man stepped into the chamber.  He knew it\r\nnot, but the old princess had passed through his room in the night.\r\n\r\n'Why, Sir Bronzebeard!' said the king, 'you are dressed before me! You\r\nneed no valet, old man, when there is battle in the wind!'\r\n\r\n'Battle, sire!' returned the colonel.  'Where then are our soldiers?'\r\n\r\n'Why, there and here,' answered the king, pointing to the colonel\r\nfirst, and then to himself.  'Where else, man?  The enemy will be upon\r\nus ere sunset, if we be not upon him ere noon.  What other thing was in\r\nyour brave brain when you donned your armour, friend?'\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty's orders, sire,' answered Sir Bronzebeard.\r\n\r\nThe king smiled and turned to Curdie.\r\n\r\n'And what was in yours, Curdie, for your first word was of battle?'\r\n\r\n'See, Your Majesty,' answered Curdie; 'I have polished my mattock. If\r\nYour Majesty had not taken the command, I would have met the enemy at\r\nthe head of my beasts, and died in comfort, or done better.'\r\n\r\n'Brave boy!' said the king.  'He who takes his life in his hand is the\r\nonly soldier.  You shall head your beasts today.  Sir Bronzebeard, will\r\nyou die with me if need be?'\r\n\r\n'Seven times, my king,' said the colonel.\r\n\r\n'Then shall we win this battle!' said the king.  'Curdie, go and bind\r\nsecurely the six, that we lose not their guards.  Can you find me a\r\nhorse, think you, Sir Bronzebeard?  Alas! they told me my white charger\r\nwas dead.'\r\n\r\n'I will go and fright the varletry with my presence, and secure, I\r\ntrust, a horse for Your Majesty, and one for myself.'\r\n\r\n'And look you, brother!' said the king; 'bring one for my miner boy\r\ntoo, and a sober old charger for the princess, for she too must go to\r\nthe battle, and conquer with us.'\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, sire,' said Curdie; 'a miner can fight best on foot. I\r\nmight smite my horse dead under me with a missed blow.  And besides\r\nthat, I must be near to my beasts.'\r\n\r\n'As you will,' said the king.  'Three horses then, Sir Bronzebeard.'\r\n\r\nThe colonel departed, doubting sorely in his heart how to accoutre and\r\nlead from the barrack stables three horses, in the teeth of his\r\nrevolted regiment.\r\n\r\nIn the hall he met the housemaid.\r\n\r\n'Can you lead a horse?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Are you willing to die for the king?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Can you do as you are bid?'\r\n\r\n'I can keep on trying, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Come then.  Were I not a man I would be a woman such as you.'\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the barrack yard, the soldiers scattered like autumn\r\nleaves before a blast of winter.  They went into the stable\r\nunchallenged--and lo! in a stall, before the colonel's eyes, stood the\r\nking's white charger, with the royal saddle and bridle hung high beside\r\nhim!\r\n\r\n'Traitorous thieves!' muttered the old man in his beard, and went along\r\nthe stalls, looking for his own black charger.  Having found him, he\r\nreturned to saddle first the king's.  But the maid had already the\r\nsaddle upon him, and so girt that the colonel could thrust no finger\r\ntip between girth and skin.  He left her to finish what she had so well\r\nbegun, and went and made ready his own.  He then chose for the princess\r\na great red horse, twenty years old, which he knew to possess every\r\nequine virtue.  This and his own he led to the palace, and the maid led\r\nthe king's.\r\n\r\nThe king and Curdie stood in the court, the king in full armour of\r\nsilvered steel, with a circlet of rubies and diamonds round his helmet.\r\nHe almost leaped for joy when he saw his great white charger come in,\r\ngentle as a child to the hand of the housemaid. But when the horse saw\r\nhis master in his armour, he reared and bounded in jubilation, yet did\r\nnot break from the hand that held him.  Then out came the princess\r\nattired and ready, with a hunting knife her father had given her by her\r\nside.  They brought her mother's saddle, splendent with gems and gold,\r\nset it on the great red horse, and lifted her to it.  But the saddle\r\nwas so big, and the horse so tall, that the child found no comfort in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'Please, King Papa,' she said, 'can I not have my white pony?'\r\n\r\n'I did not think of him, little one,' said the king.  'Where is he?'\r\n\r\n'In the stable,' answered the maid.  'I found him half starved, the\r\nonly horse within the gates, the day after the servants were driven\r\nout.  He has been well fed since.'\r\n\r\n'Go and fetch him,' said the king.\r\n\r\nAs the maid appeared with the pony, from a side door came Lina and the\r\nforty-nine, following Curdie.\r\n\r\n'I will go with Curdie and the Uglies,' cried the princess; and as soon\r\nas she was mounted she got into the middle of the pack.\r\n\r\nSo out they set, the strangest force that ever went against an enemy.\r\nThe king in silver armour sat stately on his white steed, with the\r\nstones flashing on his helmet; beside him the grim old colonel, armed\r\nin steel, rode his black charger; behind the king, a little to the\r\nright, Curdie walked afoot, his mattock shining in the sun; Lina\r\nfollowed at his heel; behind her came the wonderful company of Uglies;\r\nin the midst of them rode the gracious little Irene, dressed in blue,\r\nand mounted on the prettiest of white ponies; behind the colonel, a\r\nlittle to the left, walked the page, armed in a breastplate, headpiece,\r\nand trooper's sword he had found in the palace, all much too big for\r\nhim, and carrying a huge brass trumpet which he did his best to blow;\r\nand the king smiled and seemed pleased with his music, although it was\r\nbut the grunt of a brazen unrest.  Alongside the beasts walked Derba\r\ncarrying Barbara--their refuge the mountains, should the cause of the\r\nking be lost; as soon as they were over the river they turned aside to\r\nascend the Cliff, and there awaited the forging of the day's history.\r\nThen first Curdie saw that the housemaid, whom they had all forgotten,\r\nwas following, mounted on the great red horse, and seated in the royal\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\nMany were the eyes unfriendly of women that had stared at them from\r\ndoor and window as they passed through the city; and low laughter and\r\nmockery and evil words from the lips of children had rippled about\r\ntheir ears; but the men were all gone to welcome the enemy, the\r\nbutchers the first, the king's guard the last.  And now on the heels of\r\nthe king's army rushed out the women and children also, to gather\r\nflowers and branches, wherewith to welcome their conquerors.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile down the river, Curdie, happening to look behind him, saw\r\nthe maid, whom he had supposed gone with Derba, still following on the\r\ngreat red horse.  The same moment the king, a few paces in front of\r\nhim, caught sight of the enemy's tents, pitched where, the cliffs\r\nreceding, the bank of the river widened to a little plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 33\r\n\r\nThe Battle\r\n\r\nHe commanded the page to blow his trumpet; and, in the strength of the\r\nmoment, the youth uttered a right warlike defiance.\r\n\r\nBut the butchers and the guard, who had gone over armed to the enemy,\r\nthinking that the king had come to make his peace also, and that it\r\nmight thereafter go hard with them, rushed at once to make short work\r\nwith him, and both secure and commend themselves.  The butchers came on\r\nfirst--for the guards had slackened their saddle girths--brandishing\r\ntheir knives, and talking to their dogs. Curdie and the page, with Lina\r\nand her pack, bounded to meet them. Curdie struck down the foremost\r\nwith his mattock.  The page, finding his sword too much for him, threw\r\nit away and seized the butcher's knife, which as he rose he plunged\r\ninto the foremost dog. Lina rushed raging and gnashing among them.  She\r\nwould not look at a dog so long as there was a butcher on his legs, and\r\nshe never stopped to kill a butcher, only with one grind of her jaws\r\ncrushed a leg of him.  When they were all down, then indeed she flashed\r\namong the dogs.\r\n\r\nMeantime the king and the colonel had spurred toward the advancing\r\nguard.  The king clove the major through skull and collar bone, and the\r\ncolonel stabbed the captain in the throat.  Then a fierce combat\r\ncommenced--two against many.  But the butchers and their dogs quickly\r\ndisposed of, up came Curdie and his beasts.  The horses of the guard,\r\nstruck with terror, turned in spite of the spur, and fled in confusion.\r\n\r\nThereupon the forces of Borsagrass, which could see little of the\r\naffair, but correctly imagined a small determined body in front of\r\nthem, hastened to the attack.  No sooner did their first advancing wave\r\nappear through the foam of the retreating one, than the king and the\r\ncolonel and the page, Curdie and the beasts, went charging upon them.\r\nTheir attack, especially the rush of the Uglies, threw the first line\r\ninto great confusion, but the second came up quickly; the beasts could\r\nnot be everywhere, there were thousands to one against them, and the\r\nking and his three companions were in the greatest possible danger.\r\n\r\nA dense cloud came over the sun, and sank rapidly toward the earth. The\r\ncloud moved all together, and yet the thousands of white flakes of\r\nwhich it was made up moved each for itself in ceaseless and rapid\r\nmotion: those flakes were the wings of pigeons.  Down swooped the birds\r\nupon the invaders; right in the face of man and horse they flew with\r\nswift-beating wings, blinding eyes and confounding brain.  Horses\r\nreared and plunged and wheeled.  All was at once in confusion.  The men\r\nmade frantic efforts to seize their tormentors, but not one could they\r\ntouch; and they outdoubled them in numbers. Between every wild clutch\r\ncame a peck of beak and a buffet of pinion in the face.  Generally the\r\nbird would, with sharp-clapping wings, dart its whole body, with the\r\nswiftness of an arrow, against its singled mark, yet so as to glance\r\naloft the same instant, and descend skimming; much as the thin stone,\r\nshot with horizontal cast of arm, having touched and torn the surface\r\nof the lake, ascends to skim, touch, and tear again.  So mingled the\r\nfeathered multitude in the grim game of war.  It was a storm in which\r\nthe wind was birds, and the sea men.  And ever as each bird arrived at\r\nthe rear of the enemy, it turned, ascended, and sped to the front to\r\ncharge again.\r\n\r\nThe moment the battle began, the princess's pony took fright, and\r\nturned and fled.  But the maid wheeled her horse across the road and\r\nstopped him; and they waited together the result of the battle.\r\n\r\nAnd as they waited, it seemed to the princess right strange that the\r\npigeons, every one as it came to the rear, and fetched a compass to\r\ngather force for the reattack, should make the head of her attendant on\r\nthe red horse the goal around which it turned; so that about them was\r\nan unintermittent flapping and flashing of wings, and a curving,\r\nsweeping torrent of the side-poised wheeling bodies of birds.  Strange\r\nalso it seemed that the maid should be constantly waving her arm toward\r\nthe battle.  And the time of the motion of her arm so fitted with the\r\nrushes of birds, that it looked as if the birds obeyed her gesture, and\r\nshe was casting living javelins by the thousand against the enemy.  The\r\nmoment a pigeon had rounded her head, it went off straight as bolt from\r\nbow, and with trebled velocity.\r\n\r\nBut of these strange things, others besides the princess had taken\r\nnote.  From a rising ground whence they watched the battle in growing\r\ndismay, the leaders of the enemy saw the maid and her motions, and,\r\nconcluding her an enchantress, whose were the airy legions humiliating\r\nthem, set spurs to their horses, made a circuit, outflanked the king,\r\nand came down upon her.  But suddenly by her side stood a stalwart old\r\nman in the garb of a miner, who, as the general rode at her, sword in\r\nhand, heaved his swift mattock, and brought it down with such force on\r\nthe forehead of his charger, that he fell to the ground like a log.\r\nHis rider shot over his head and lay stunned.  Had not the great red\r\nhorse reared and wheeled, he would have fallen beneath that of the\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nWith lifted sabre, one of his attendant officers rode at the miner. But\r\na mass of pigeons darted in the faces of him and his horse, and the\r\nnext moment he lay beside his commander.\r\n\r\nThe rest of them turned and fled, pursued by the birds.\r\n\r\n'Ah, friend Peter!' said the maid; 'thou hast come as I told thee!\r\nWelcome and thanks!'\r\n\r\nBy this time the battle was over.  The rout was general.  The enemy\r\nstormed back upon their own camp, with the beasts roaring in the midst\r\nof them, and the king and his army, now reinforced by one, pursuing.\r\nBut presently the king drew rein.\r\n\r\n'Call off your hounds, Curdie, and let the pigeons do the rest,' he\r\nshouted, and turned to see what had become of the princess.\r\n\r\nIn full panic fled the invaders, sweeping down their tents, stumbling\r\nover their baggage, trampling on their dead and wounded, ceaselessly\r\npursued and buffeted by the white-winged army of heaven.  Homeward they\r\nrushed the road they had come, straight for the borders, many dropping\r\nfrom pure fatigue, and lying where they fell.  And still the pigeons\r\nwere in their necks as they ran.  At length to the eyes of the king and\r\nhis army nothing was visible save a dust cloud below, and a bird cloud\r\nabove.  Before night the bird cloud came back, flying high over\r\nGwyntystorm.  Sinking swiftly, it disappeared among the ancient roofs\r\nof the palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 34\r\n\r\nJudgement\r\n\r\nThe king and his army returned, bringing with them one prisoner only,\r\nthe lord chancellor.  Curdie had dragged him from under a fallen tent,\r\nnot by the hand of a man, but by the foot of a mule.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the city, it was still as the grave.  The citizens\r\nhad fled home.  'We must submit,' they cried, 'or the king and his\r\ndemons will destroy us.'  The king rode through the streets in silence,\r\nill-pleased with his people.  But he stopped his horse in the midst of\r\nthe market place, and called, in a voice loud and clear as the cry of a\r\nsilver trumpet, 'Go and find your own.  Bury your dead, and bring home\r\nyour wounded.'  Then he turned him gloomily to the palace.\r\n\r\nJust as they reached the gates, Peter, who, as they went, had been\r\ntelling his tale to Curdie, ended it with the words:\r\n\r\n'And so there I was, in the nick of time to save the two princesses!'\r\n\r\n'The two princesses, Father!  The one on the great red horse was the\r\nhousemaid,' said Curdie, and ran to open the gates for the king.\r\n\r\nThey found Derba returned before them, and already busy preparing them\r\nfood.  The king put up his charger with his own hands, rubbed him down,\r\nand fed him.\r\n\r\nWhen they had washed, and eaten and drunk, he called the colonel, and\r\ntold Curdie and the page to bring out the traitors and the beasts, and\r\nattend him to the market place.\r\n\r\nBy this time the people were crowding back into the city, bearing their\r\ndead and wounded.  And there was lamentation in Gwyntystorm, for no one\r\ncould comfort himself, and no one had any to comfort him.  The nation\r\nwas victorious, but the people were conquered.\r\n\r\nThe king stood in the centre of the market place, upon the steps of the\r\nancient cross.  He had laid aside his helmet and put on his crown, but\r\nhe stood all armed beside, with his sword in his hand. He called the\r\npeople to him, and, for all the terror of the beasts, they dared not\r\ndisobey him.  Those, even, who were carrying their wounded laid them\r\ndown, and drew near trembling.\r\n\r\nThen the king said to Curdie and the page:\r\n\r\n'Set the evil men before me.'\r\n\r\nHe looked upon them for a moment in mingled anger and pity, then turned\r\nto the people and said:\r\n\r\n'Behold your trust!  Ye slaves, behold your leaders!  I would have\r\nfreed you, but ye would not be free.  Now shall ye be ruled with a rod\r\nof iron, that ye may learn what freedom is, and love it and seek it.\r\nThese wretches I will send where they shall mislead you no longer.'\r\n\r\nHe made a sign to Curdie, who immediately brought up the legserpent.\r\nTo the body of the animal they bound the lord chamberlain, speechless\r\nwith horror.  The butler began to shriek and pray, but they bound him\r\non the back of Clubhead.  One after another, upon the largest of the\r\ncreatures they bound the whole seven, each through the unveiling terror\r\nlooking the villain he was.  Then said the king:\r\n\r\n'I thank you, my good beasts; and I hope to visit you ere long. Take\r\nthese evil men with you, and go to your place.'\r\n\r\nLike a whirlwind they were in the crowd, scattering it like dust. Like\r\nhounds they rushed from the city, their burdens howling and raving.\r\n\r\nWhat became of them I have never heard.\r\n\r\nThen the king turned once more to the people and said, 'Go to your\r\nhouses'; nor vouchsafed them another word.  They crept home like\r\nchidden hounds.\r\n\r\nThe king returned to the palace.  He made the colonel a duke, and the\r\npage a knight, and Peter he appointed general of all his mines. But to\r\nCurdie he said:\r\n\r\n'You are my own boy, Curdie.  My child cannot choose but love you, and\r\nwhen you are grown up--if you both will--you shall marry each other,\r\nand be king and queen when I am gone.  Till then be the king's Curdie.'\r\n\r\nIrene held out her arms to Curdie.  He raised her in his, and she\r\nkissed him.\r\n\r\n'And my Curdie too!' she said.\r\n\r\nThereafter the people called him Prince Conrad; but the king always\r\ncalled him either just Curdie, or my miner boy.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to supper, and Derba and the knight and the housemaid\r\nwaited, and Barbara sat at the king's left hand.  The housemaid poured\r\nout the wine; and as she poured for Curdie red wine that foamed in the\r\ncup, as if glad to see the light whence it had been banished so long,\r\nshe looked him in the eyes.  And Curdie started, and sprang from his\r\nseat, and dropped on his knees, and burst into tears.  And the maid\r\nsaid with a smile, such as none but one could smile:\r\n\r\n'Did I not tell you, Curdie, that it might be you would not know me\r\nwhen next you saw me?'\r\n\r\nThen she went from the room, and in a moment returned in royal purple,\r\nwith a crown of diamonds and rubies, from under which her hair went\r\nflowing to the floor, all about her ruby-slippered feet. Her face was\r\nradiant with joy, the joy overshadowed by a faint mist as of\r\nunfulfilment.  The king rose and kneeled on one knee before her.  All\r\nkneeled in like homage.  Then the king would have yielded her his royal\r\nchair.  But she made them all sit down, and with her own hands placed\r\nat the table seats for Derba and the page.  Then in ruby crown and\r\nroyal purple she served them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 35\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\nThe king sent Curdie out into his dominions to search for men and women\r\nthat had human hands.  And many such he found, honest and true, and\r\nbrought them to his master.  So a new and upright court was formed, and\r\nstrength returned to the nation.\r\n\r\nBut the exchequer was almost empty, for the evil men had squandered\r\neverything, and the king hated taxes unwillingly paid.  Then came\r\nCurdie and said to the king that the city stood upon gold.  And the\r\nking sent for men wise in the ways of the earth, and they built\r\nsmelting furnaces, and Peter brought miners, and they mined the gold,\r\nand smelted it, and the king coined it into money, and therewith\r\nestablished things well in the land.\r\n\r\nThe same day on which he found his boy, Peter set out to go home. When\r\nhe told the good news to Joan, his wife, she rose from her chair and\r\nsaid, 'Let us go.'  And they left the cottage, and repaired to\r\nGwyntystorm.  And on a mountain above the city they built themselves a\r\nwarm house for their old age, high in the clear air.\r\n\r\nAs Peter mined one day, at the back of the king's wine Cellar, he broke\r\ninto a cavern crusted with gems, and much wealth flowed therefrom, and\r\nthe king used it wisely.\r\n\r\nQueen Irene--that was the right name of the old princess--was\r\nthereafter seldom long absent from the palace.  Once or twice when she\r\nwas missing, Barbara, who seemed to know of her sometimes when nobody\r\nelse had a notion whither she had gone, said she was with the dear old\r\nUglies in the wood.  Curdie thought that perhaps her business might be\r\nwith others there as well.  All the uppermost rooms in the palace were\r\nleft to her use, and when any one was in need of her help, up thither\r\nhe must go.  But even when she was there, he did not always succeed in\r\nfinding her.  She, however, always knew that such a one had been\r\nlooking for her.\r\n\r\nCurdie went to find her one day.  As he ascended the last stair, to\r\nmeet him came the well-known scent of her roses; and when he opened the\r\ndoor, lo! there was the same gorgeous room in which his touch had been\r\nglorified by her fire!  And there burned the fire--a huge heap of red\r\nand white roses.  Before the hearth stood the princess, an old\r\ngrey-haired woman, with Lina a little behind her, slowly wagging her\r\ntail, and looking like a beast of prey that can hardly so long restrain\r\nitself from springing as to be sure of its victim. The queen was\r\ncasting roses, more and more roses, upon the fire. At last she turned\r\nand said, 'Now Lina!'--and Lina dashed burrowing into the fire.  There\r\nwent up a black smoke and a dust, and Lina was never more seen in the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nIrene and Curdie were married.  The old king died, and they were king\r\nand queen.  As long as they lived Gwyntystorm was a better city, and\r\ngood people grew in it.  But they had no children, and when they died\r\nthe people chose a king.  And the new king went mining and mining in\r\nthe rock under the city, and grew more and more eager after the gold,\r\nand paid less and less heed to his people.  Rapidly they sank toward\r\ntheir old wickedness.  But still the king went on mining, and coining\r\ngold by the pailful, until the people were worse even than in the old\r\ntime.  And so greedy was the king after gold, that when at last the ore\r\nbegan to fail, he caused the miners to reduce the pillars which Peter\r\nand they that followed him had left standing to bear the city.  And\r\nfrom the girth of an oak of a thousand years, they chipped them down to\r\nthat of a fir tree of fifty.\r\n\r\nOne day at noon, when life was at its highest, the whole city fell with\r\na roaring crash.  The cries of men and the shrieks of women went up\r\nwith its dust, and then there was a great silence.\r\n\r\nWhere the mighty rock once towered, crowded with homes and crowned with\r\na palace, now rushes and raves a stone-obstructed rapid of the river.\r\nAll around spreads a wilderness of wild deer, and the very name of\r\nGwyntystorm had ceased from the lips of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Princess and the Curdie, by George MacDonald",
