Bone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe boxed ad in the opportunities section of the Kardon Journal of\r\nAllied Medical Sciences stood out like a cut diamond in a handful\r\nof gravel. “Wanted,” it read, “Veterinarian--for residency in active\r\nlivestock operation. Single recent graduate preferred. Quarters and\r\nservice furnished. Well-equipped hospital. Five-year contract, renewal\r\noption, starting salary 15,000 cr./annum with periodic increases. State\r\nage, school, marital status, and enclose recent tri-di with application.\r\nAddress Box V-9, this journal.”\r\n\r\nJac Kennon read the box a second time. There must be a catch to it.\r\nNothing that paid a salary that large could possibly be on the level.\r\nFifteen thousand a year was top pay even on Beta, and an offer like this\r\nfor a new graduate was unheard of--unless Kardon was in the middle of an\r\ninflation. But Kardon wasn’t. The planet’s financial status was A-1.\r\nHe knew. He’d checked that immediately after landing. Whatever might\r\nbe wrong with Kardon, it wasn’t her currency. The rate of exchange was\r\n1.2-1 Betan.\r\n\r\nA five-year contract--hmm--that would be seventy-five thousand. Figure\r\nthree thousand a year for living expenses, that would leave sixty-plenty\r\nof capital to start a clinic. The banks couldn’t turn him down if he had\r\nthat much cash collateral.\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled wryly. He’d better get the job before he started\r\nspending the money he didn’t have. He had 231 credits plus a few\r\nhalves, tenths, and hundredths, a diploma in veterinary medicine, some\r\ntextbooks, a few instruments, and a first-class spaceman’s ticket. By\r\nwatching his expenses he had enough money to live here for a month and\r\nif nothing came of his efforts to find a job on this planet, there was\r\nalways his spaceman’s ticket and another world.\r\n\r\nAnother world! There were over six thousand planets in the Brotherhood\r\nof Man. At two months per planet, not figuring transit time, it would\r\ntake more than a thousand Galactic Standard years to visit them all, and\r\na man could look forward to scarcely more than five hundred at best. The\r\nhabitat of Man had become too large. There wasn’t time to explore every\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nBut a man could have certain standards, and look until he found a\r\nposition that fitted. The trouble was--if the standards were too high\r\nthe jobs were too scarce. Despite the chronic shortage of veterinarians\r\nthroughout the Brotherhood, there was a peculiar reluctance on the part\r\nof established practitioners to welcome recent graduates. Most of the\r\nads in the professional journals read “State salary desired,” which was\r\nnothing more than economic blackmail--a bald-faced attempt to get as\r\nmuch for as little as possible. Kennon grimaced wryly. He’d be damned if\r\nhe’d sell his training for six thousand a year. Slave labor, that’s what\r\nit was. There were a dozen ads like that in the Journal. Well, he’d give\r\nthem a trial, but he’d ask eight thousand and full GEA benefits. Eight\r\nyears of school and two more as an intern were worth at least that.\r\n\r\nHe pulled the portable voicewrite to a comfortable position in front of\r\nthe view wall and began composing another of the series of letters that\r\nhad begun months ago in time and parsecs away in space. His voice was a\r\nfluid counterpoint to the soft hum of the machine.\r\n\r\nAnd as he dictated, his eyes took in the vista through the view\r\nwall. Albertsville was a nice town, too young for slums, too new for\r\noverpopulation. The white buildings were the color of winter butter in\r\nthe warm yellow sunlight as the city drowsed in the noonday heat. It\r\nnestled snugly in the center of a bowl-shaped valley whose surrounding\r\nforest clad hills gave mute confirmation to the fact that Kardon\r\nwas still primitive, an unsettled world that had not yet reached the\r\nexplosive stage of population growth that presaged maturity. But that\r\nwas no disadvantage. In fact, Kennon liked it. Living could be fun on a\r\nplanet like this.\r\n\r\nIt was abysmally crude compared to Beta, but the Brotherhood had opened\r\nKardon less than five hundred years ago, and in such a short time one\r\ncouldn’t expect all the comforts of civilization.\r\n\r\nIt required a high population density to supply them, and while Kardon\r\nwas integrated its population was scarcely more than two hundred\r\nmillion. It would be some time yet before this world would achieve a\r\nClass I status. However, a Class II planet had some advantages. What it\r\nlacked in conveniences it made up in opportunities and elbow room.\r\n\r\nA normal Betan would have despised this world, but Kennon wasn’t normal,\r\nalthough to the casual eye he was a typical representative of the\r\nMedico-Technological Civilization, long legged, fair haired, and short\r\nbodied with the typical Betan squint that left his eyes mere slits\r\nbehind thick lashes and heavy brows. The difference was internal rather\r\nthan external.\r\n\r\nPossibly it was due to the fact that his father was the commander of a\r\nShortliner and most of his formative years had been spent in space. To\r\nKennon, accustomed to the timeless horror of hyper space, all planets\r\nwere good, broad open places where a man could breathe unfiltered air\r\nand look for miles across distances unbroken by dually bulk heads and\r\nsafety shields. On a planet there were spaciousness and freedom and\r\nafter the claustrophobic confinement of a hyper ship any world was\r\nparadise. Kennon sighed, finished his letters, and placed them in the\r\nmail chute. Perhaps, this time, there would be a favorable reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nKennon was startled by the speed with which his letters were answered.\r\nAccustomed to the slower pace of Beta he had expected a week would\r\nelapse before the first reply, but within twenty-four hours nine of his\r\ntwelve inquiries were returned. Five expressed the expected “Thank you\r\nbut I feel that your asking salary is a bit high in view of your lack\r\nof experience.” Three were frankly interested and requested a personal\r\ninterview. And the last was the letter, outstanding in its quietly\r\nostentatious folder-the reply from Box V-9.\r\n\r\n“Would Dr. Kennon call at 10 A.M. tomorrow at the offices of\r\nOutworld Enterprises Incorporated and bring this letter and suitable\r\nidentifications?” Kennon chuckled. Would he? There was no question about\r\nit. The address, 200 Central Avenue, was only a few blocks away. In\r\nfact, he could see the building from his window, a tall functional block\r\nof durilium and plastic, soaring above the others on the street, the\r\nsunlight gleaming off its clean square lines. He eyed it curiously,\r\nwondering what he would find inside.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe receptionist took his I.D. and the letter, scanned them briefly,\r\nand slipped them into one of the message tubes beside her desk. “It will\r\nonly be a moment, Doctor,” she said impersonally. “Would you care to sit\r\ndown? ’”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” he said. The minute, reflected, could easily be an hour. But\r\nshe was right. It was only a minute until the message tube clicked\r\nand popped a capsule onto the girl’s desk. She opened it, and removed\r\nKennon’s I.D. and a small yellow plastic rectangle. Her eyes widened at\r\nthe sight of the plastic card.\r\n\r\n“Here you are, Doctor. Take shaft number one. Slip the card into the\r\nscanner slot and you’ll be taken to the correct floor. The offices you\r\nwant will be at the end of the corridor to the left. You’ll find any\r\nother data you may need on the card in case you get lost.” She looked at\r\nhim with a curious mixture of surprise and respect as she handed him the\r\ncontents of the message tube.\r\n\r\nKennon murmured an acknowledgment, took the card and his I.D., and\r\nentered the grav-shaft. There was the usual moment of heaviness as\r\nthe shaft whisked him upward and deposited him in front of a thickly\r\ncarpeted corridor.\r\n\r\nExecutive level, Kennon thought as he followed the receptionist’s\r\ndirections. No wonder she had looked respectful. But what was he doing\r\nhere? The employment of a veterinarian wasn’t important enough to demand\r\nthe attention of a senior executive. The personnel section could handle\r\nthe details of his application as well as not. He shrugged. Perhaps\r\nveterinarians were more important on Kardon. He didn’t know a thing\r\nabout this world’s customs.\r\n\r\nHe opened the unmarked door at the end of the corridor, entered a small\r\nreception room, smiled uncertainly at the woman behind the desk, and\r\nreceived an answering smile in return.\r\n\r\nCome right in, Dr. Kennon. Mr. Alexander is waiting for you.\r\n\r\nAlexander! The entrepreneur himself! Why? Numb with surprise Kennon\r\nwatched the woman open the intercom on her desk.\r\n\r\n“Sir, Dr. Kennon is here,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Bring him in,” a smooth voice replied from the speaker. Alexander X. M.\r\nAlexander, President of Outworld Enterprises--a lean, dark, wolfish man\r\nin his early sixties--eyed Kennon with a flat predatory intentness that\r\nwas oddly disquieting. His stare combined the analytical inspection\r\nof the pathologist, the probing curiosity of the psychiatrist, and the\r\nweighing appraisal of the butcher. Kennon’s thoughts about Alexander’s\r\nyouth vanished that instant. Those eyes belonged to a leader on the\r\nbattlefield of galactic business.\r\n\r\nKennon felt the conditioned respect for authority surge through him in\r\na smothering wave. Grimly he fought it down, knowing it was a sign of\r\nweakness that would do him no good in the interview which lay ahead.\r\n\r\n“So you’re Kennon,” Alexander said. His lingua franca was clean and\r\naccentless. “I expected someone older.”\r\n\r\n“Frankly, sir, so did I,” Kennon replied.\r\n\r\nAlexander smiled, an oddly pleasant smile that transformed the hard\r\nstraight lines in his face into friendly curves. “Business, Dr. Kennon,\r\nis not the sole property of age.”\r\n\r\n“Nor is a veterinary degree,” Kennon replied.\r\n\r\n“True. But one thinks of a Betan as someone ancient and sedate.”\r\n\r\n“Ours is an old planet--but we still have new generations.”\r\n\r\n“A fact most of us outsiders find hard to believe,” Alexander said. “I\r\npicture your world as an ironclad society crystallized by age and custom\r\ninto something rigid and in flexible.”\r\n\r\n“You would be wrong to do so,” Kennon said. “Even though we are cultural\r\nintroverts there is plenty of dynamism within our society.”\r\n\r\n“How is it that you happen to be out here on the edge of civilization?”\r\n\r\n“I never said I was like my society,” Kennon grinned. “Actually I\r\nsuppose I’m one of the proverbial bad apples.”\r\n\r\n“There’s more to it than that,” Alexander said. “Your early years\r\nprobably influenced you.”\r\n\r\nKennon looked sharply at the entrepreneur. How much did the man really\r\nknow about him? “I suppose so,” he said indifferently.\r\n\r\nAlexander looked pleased. “But even with your childhood experiences\r\nthere must be an atavistic streak in you--a throwback to your\r\nadventurous Earth forebears who settled your world?”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. “Perhaps you’re right. I really don’t know. Actually,\r\nI’ve never thought about it. It merely seemed to me that an undeveloped\r\nworld offered more opportunity.”\r\n\r\n“It does,” Alexander said. “But it also offers more work. If you’re\r\nfiguring that you can get along on the minimum physical effort required\r\non the Central Worlds, you have a shock coming.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not that innocent,” Kennon said. “But I am not so stupid that I\r\ncan’t apply modifications of Betan techniques to worlds as new as this.”\r\n\r\nAlexander chuckled. “I like you,” he said suddenly. “Here read this and\r\nsee if you’d care to work for me.” He picked a contract form from one of\r\nthe piles of paper on his desk and handed it to Kennon. “This is one\r\nof our standard work contracts. Take it back to your hotel and check it\r\nover. I’ll expect to see you at this time tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Why waste time?” Kennon said. “The rapid-reading technique originated\r\non Beta. I can tell you in fifteen minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm. Certainly. Read it here if you wish. I like to get things\r\nsettled--the sooner the better. Sit down, young man and read. You can\r\nrouse me when you’re finished.” He turned his attention to the papers on\r\nhis desk and within seconds was completely oblivious of Kennon, his face\r\nset in the rapt trancelike expression of a trained rapid reader.\r\n\r\nKennon watched for a moment as sheets of paper passed through\r\nAlexander’s hands to be added to the pile at the opposite end of the\r\ndesk. The man would do better, he thought, if he would have his staff\r\ntranscribe the papers to microfilm that could be read through an\r\ninterval-timed scanner. He might suggest that later. As for now, he\r\nshrugged and seated himself in the chair beside the desk. The quiet was\r\nbroken only by the rustle of paper as the two rapt-faced men turned page\r\nafter page with mechanical regularity.\r\n\r\nFinally Kennon turned the last page, paused, blinked, and performed\r\nthe necessary mental gymnastics to orient his time sense. Alexander, he\r\nnoticed, was still engrossed, sunk in his autohypnotic trance. Kennon\r\nwaited until he had finished the legal folder which he was reading and\r\nthen gently intruded upon Alexander’s concentration.\r\n\r\nAlexander looked up blankly and then went through the same mental\r\ngyrations Kennon had performed a few minutes before. His eyes focused\r\nand became hard and alert.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he asked. “What do you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“I think it’s the damnedest, trickiest, most unilateral piece of\r\nlegalistics I’ve ever seen,” Kennon said bluntly. “If that’s the best\r\nyou can offer, I wouldn’t touch the job with a pair of forceps.”\r\n\r\nAlexander smiled. “I see you read the fine print,” he said. There was\r\nquiet amusement in his voice. “So you don’t like the contract?”\r\n\r\n“No sensible man would. I’m damned if I’ll sign commitment papers just\r\nto get a job. No wonder you’re having trouble getting professional help.\r\nIf your contracts are all like that it’s’ a wonder anyone works for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“We have no complaints from our employees,” Alexander said stiffly.\r\n\r\n“How could you? If they signed that contract you’d have a perfect right\r\nto muzzle them.”\r\n\r\n“There are other applicants for this post,” Alexander said.\r\n\r\n“Then get one of them. I wouldn’t be interested.”\r\n\r\n“A spaceman’s ticket is a good thing to have,” Alexander said idly.\r\n“It’s a useful ace in the hole. Besides, you have had three other job\r\noffers--all of which are good even though they don’t pay fifteen Ems a\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\nKennon did a quick double take. Alexander’s investigative staff was\r\nbetter than good. It was uncanny.\r\n\r\n“But seriously, Dr. Kennon, I am pleased that you do not like that\r\ncontract. Frankly, I wouldn’t consider employing you if you did.”\r\n\r\n“Sir?”\r\n\r\n“That contract is a screen. It weeds out the careless, the fools, and\r\nthe unfit in one operation. A man who would sign a thing like that\r\nhas no place in my organization.” Alexander chuckled at Kennon’s blank\r\nexpression. “I see you have had no experience with screening contracts.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t,” Kennon admitted. “On Beta the tests are formal. The\r\nMedico-Psych Division supervises them.”\r\n\r\n“Different worlds, different methods,” Alexander observed. “But they’re\r\nall directed toward the same goal. Here we aren’t so civilized. We\r\ndepend more on personal judgment.” He took another contract from one of\r\nthe drawers of his desk. “Take a look at this. I think you’ll be more\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind, I’ll read it now,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\nAlexander nodded.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“It’s fair enough,” Kennon said, “except for Article Twelve.”\r\n\r\n“The personal privilege section?\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s the contract. You can take it or leave it.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll leave it,” Kennon said. “Thank you for your time.” He rose to his\r\nfeet, smiled at Alexander, and turned to the door. “Don’t bother to call\r\nyour receptionist,” he said. “I can find my way out.”\r\n\r\n“Just a minute, Doctor,” Alexander said. He was standing behind the\r\ndesk, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n“Another test?” Kennon inquired.\r\n\r\nAlexander nodded. “The critical one,” he said. “Do you want the job?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Without knowing more about it?”\r\n\r\n“The contract is adequate. It defines my duties.”\r\n\r\n“And you think you can handle them?”\r\n\r\n“I know I can.”\r\n\r\n“I notice,” Alexander observed, “that you didn’t object to other\r\nprovisions.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. They’re pretty rigid, but for the salary you are paying I\r\nfigure you should have some rights. Certainly you have the right to\r\nprotect your interests. But that Article Twelve is a direct violation of\r\neverything a human being should hold sacred besides being a violation\r\nof the Peeper Laws. I’d never sign a contract that didn’t carry a full\r\nPeeper rider.”\r\n\r\n“That’s quite a bit.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the minimum,” Kennon corrected. “Naturally, I won’t object\r\nto mnemonic erasure of matters pertaining to your business once my\r\ncontract’s completed and I leave your employment. But until then there\r\nwill be no conditioning, no erasures, no taps, no snoopers, and no\r\ncheckups other than the regular periodic psychans. I’ll consult with you\r\non vacation time and will arrange it to suit your convenience. I’ll even\r\nagree to emergency recall, but that’s the limit.” Kennon’s voice was\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n“You realize I’m agreeing to give you a great deal of personal liberty,”\r\n Alexander said. “How can I protect myself?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll sign a contingency rider,” Kennon said, “if you will specify\r\nprecisely what security matters I am not to reveal.”\r\n\r\n“I accept,” Alexander said. “Consider yourself hired.” He touched\r\na button on his desk. “Prepare a standard 2-A contract for Dr.\r\nJac Kennon’s signature. And attach two riders, a full P-P-yes, no\r\nexceptions--and a security-leak contingency, Form 287-C. Yes--that’s\r\nright--that one. And strike out all provisions of Article Twelve which\r\nconflict with the Peeper Laws. Yes. Now--and finish it as soon as you\r\ncan.” He touched another button. “Well, that’s that,” he said. “I hope\r\nyou’ll enjoy being a member of our group.”\r\n\r\n“I think I shall,” Kennon said. “You know, sir, I would have waived part\r\nof that last demand if you had cared to argue.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” Alexander said. “But what concessions I could have wrung\r\nfrom you would be relatively unimportant beside the fact that you would\r\nbe unhappy about them later. What little I could have won here, I’d lose\r\nelsewhere. And since I want you, I’d prefer to have you satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” Kennon said. Actually he didn’t see at all. He looked curiously\r\nat the entrepreneur. Alexander couldn’t be as easy as he seemed.\r\nObjectivity and dispassionate weighing and balancing were nice traits\r\nand very helpful ones, but in the bear pit of galactic business they\r\nwouldn’t keep their owner alive for five minutes. The interworld trade\r\nsharks would have skinned him long ago and divided the stripped carcass\r\nof his company between them.\r\n\r\nBut Outworld was a “respected” company. The exchange reports said\r\nso--which made Alexander a different breed of cat entirely. Still, his\r\nsurface was perfect--polished and impenetrable as a duralloy turret on\r\none of the latest Brotherhood battleships. Kennon regretted he wasn’t a\r\nsensitive. It would be nice to know what Alexander really was.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, sir,” Kennon asked. “What are the real reasons that make you\r\nthink I’m the man you want?”\r\n\r\n“And you’re the young man who’s so insistent on a personal privacy\r\nrider,” Alexander chuckled. “However, there’s no harm telling you. There\r\nare several reasons.\r\n\r\n“You’re from a culture whose name is a byword for moral integrity. That\r\nmakes you a good risk so far as your ethics are concerned. In addition\r\nyou’re the product of one of the finest educational systems in the\r\ngalaxy-and you have proven your intelligence to my satisfaction. You\r\nalso showed me that you weren’t a spineless ‘yes man.’ And finally, you\r\nhave a spirit of adventure. Not one in a million of your people would do\r\nwhat you have done. What more could an entrepreneur ask of a prospective\r\nemployee?”\r\n\r\nKennon sighed and gave up. Alexander wasn’t going to reveal a thing.\r\n\r\n“All I hope,” Alexander continued affably, “is that you’ll find Outworld\r\nEnterprises as attractive as did your predecessor Dr. Williamson. He was\r\nwith us until he died last month--better than a hundred years.”\r\n\r\n“Died rather young, didn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly, he was nearly four hundred when he joined us. My\r\ngrandfather was essentially conservative. He liked older men, and Old\r\nDoc was one of his choices--a good one, too. He was worth every credit\r\nwe paid him.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try to do as well,” Kennon said, “but I’d like to warn you that I\r\nhave no intention of staying as long as he did. I want to build a clinic\r\nand I figure sixty thousand is about enough to get started.”\r\n\r\n“When will you veterinarians ever learn to be organization men?”\r\n Alexander asked. “You’re as independent as tomcats.”\r\n\r\nKennon grinned. “It’s a breed characteristic, I guess.”\r\n\r\nAlexander shrugged. “Perhaps you’ll change your mind after you’ve worked\r\nfor us.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, but I doubt it.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me that five years from now,” Alexander said--“Ah--here are\r\nthe contracts.” He smiled at the trim secretary who entered the room\r\ncarrying a stack of papers.\r\n\r\n“The riders are as you asked, sir,” the girl said.\r\n\r\n“Good. Now, Doctor, if you please.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mind if I check them?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. And when you’re through, just leave them on the\r\ndesk--except for your copy, of course.” Alexander scrawled his signature\r\non the bottom of each contract. “Don’t disturb me. I’ll be in contact\r\nwith you. Leave your whereabouts with your hotel.” He turned to the\r\npapers in front of him, and then looked up for the last time. “Just one\r\nmore thing,” he said. “You impress me as a cautious man. It would be\r\njust as well if you carried your caution with you when you leave this\r\nroom.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded, and Alexander turned back to his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n“I’d never have guessed yesterday that I’d be here today,” Kennon said\r\nas he looked down at the yellow waters of the Xantline Sea flashing to\r\nthe rear of the airboat at a steady thousand kilometers per hour as they\r\nsped westward in the middle traffic level. The water, some ten thousand\r\nmeters below, had been completely empty for hours as the craft hurtled\r\nthrough the equatorial air.\r\n\r\n“We have to move fast to stay ahead of our ulcers,” Alexander said\r\nwith a wry smile. “Besides, I wanted to get away from the Albertsville\r\noffices for awhile.”\r\n\r\n“Three hours’ notice,” Kennon said. “That’s almost too fast.”\r\n\r\n“You had nothing to keep you in the city, and neither did I--at least\r\nnothing important. There are plenty of females where we are going and\r\nI need you on Flora--not in Albertsville. Besides I can get you there\r\nfaster than if you waited for a company transport.”\r\n\r\n“Judging from those empty sea lanes below, Flora must be an\r\nout-of-the-way place,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“It is. It’s out of the trade lanes. Most of the commercial traffic is\r\nin the southern hemisphere. The northern hemisphere is practically\r\nall water. Except for Flora and the Otpens there isn’t a land area for\r\nnearly three thousand kilometers in any direction, and since the company\r\nowns Flora and the surrounding island groups there’s no reason for\r\nshipping to come there. We have our own supply vessels, a Discovery\r\nCharter, and a desire for privacy.--Ah! It won’t be long now. There’s\r\nthe Otpens!” Alexander pointed at a smudge on the horizon that quickly\r\nresolved into an irregular chain of tiny islets that slipped below them.\r\nKennon got a glimpse of gray concrete on one of the larger islands, a\r\nsmudge of green trees, and white beaches against which the yellow waters\r\ndashed in smothers of foam.\r\n\r\n“Rugged-looking place,” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Most of them are deserted. Two support search and warning stations and\r\nautomatic interceptors to protect our property. Look!--there’s Flora.”\r\n Alexander gestured at the land mass that appeared below.\r\n\r\nFlora was a great green oval two hundred kilometers long and about a\r\nhundred wide.\r\n\r\n“Pretty, isn’t it?” Alexander said as they sped over the low range\r\nof hills and the single gaunt volcano filling the eastward end of\r\nthe island and swept over a broad green valley dotted with fields\r\nand orchards interspersed at intervals by red-roofed structures whose\r\npurpose was obvious.\r\n\r\n“Our farms,” Alexander said redundantly. The airboat crossed a\r\nfair-sized river. “That’s the Styx,” Alexander said. “Grandfather named\r\nit. He was a classicist in his way--spent a lot of his time reading\r\nbooks most people never heard of. Things like the Iliad and Gone with\r\nthe Wind. The mountains he called the Apennines, and that volcano’s\r\nMount Olympus. The marshland to the north is called the Pontine\r\nMarshes--our main road is the Camino Real.” Alexander grinned. “There’s\r\na lot of Earth on Flora. You’ll find it in every name. Grandfather\r\nwas an Earthman and he used to get nostalgic for the homeworld.\r\nWell--there’s Alexandria coming up. We’ve just about reached the end of\r\nthe line.”\r\n\r\nKennon stared down at the huge gray-green citadel resting on a small\r\nhill in the center of an open plain. It was a Class II Fortalice built\r\non the efficient star-shaped plan of half a millennium ago--an ugly\r\nspiky pile of durilium, squat and massive with defensive shields and\r\nweapons which could still withstand hours of assault by the most modern\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n“Why did he build a thing like that?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Alexandria?--well, we had trouble with the natives when we first came,\r\nand Grandfather had a synthesizer and tapes for a Fortalice in his\r\nship. So he built it. It serves the dual purpose of base and house. It’s\r\nmostly house now, but it’s still capable of being defended.”\r\n\r\n“And those outbuildings?”\r\n\r\n“They’re part of your job.”\r\n\r\nThe airboat braked sharply and settled with a smooth, sickeningly\r\nswift rush that left Kennon gasping--feeling that his stomach was still\r\nfloating above him in the middle level. He never had become accustomed\r\nto an arbutus landing characteristics. Spacers were slower and steadier.\r\nThe ship landed gently on a pitted concrete slab near the massive\r\nradiation shields of the barricaded entranceway to the fortress.\r\nProjectors in polished dually turrets swivelled to point their ugly\r\nnoses at them. It gave Kennon a queasy feeling. He never liked to trust\r\nhis future to automatic machinery. If the analyzers failed to decode the\r\nship’s I.D. properly, Kennon, Alexander, the ship, and a fair slice of\r\nsurrounding territory would become an incandescent mass of dissociated\r\natoms.\r\n\r\n“Grandfather was a good builder,” Alexander, said proudly. “Those\r\nprojectors have been mounted nearly four hundred years and they’re still\r\nas good as the day they were installed.”\r\n\r\n“I can see that,” Kennon said uncomfortably. “You ought to dismantle\r\nthem. They’re enough to give a man the weebies.”\r\n\r\nAlexander chuckled. “Oh--they’re safe. The firing mechanism’s safetied.\r\nBut we keep them in operating condition. You never can tell when they’ll\r\ncome in handy.”\r\n\r\n“I knew Kardon was primitive, but I didn’t think it was that bad. What’s\r\nthe trouble?”\r\n\r\n“None--right now,” Alexander said obliquely, “and since we’ve shown we\r\ncan handle ourselves there probably won’t be any more.”\r\n\r\n“You must raise some pretty valuable stock if the competition tried to\r\nrustle them in the face of that armament.”\r\n\r\n“We do.” Alexander said. “Now if you’ll follow me”--the entrepreneur\r\nopened the cabin door letting in a blast of heat and a flood of yellow\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n“Great Arthur Fleming!” Kennon exploded. “This place is a furnace!”\r\n\r\n“It’s hot out here on the strip,” Alexander admitted, “but its cool\r\nenough inside. Besides, you’ll get used to this quickly enough--and\r\nthe nights are wonderful. The evening rains cool things off. Well--come\r\nalong.” He began walking toward the arched entrance to the great\r\nbuilding some hundred meters away. Kennon followed looking around\r\ncuriously. So this was to be his home for the next five years? It didn’t\r\nlook particularly inviting. There was a forbidding air about the place\r\nthat was in stark contrast to its pleasant surroundings.\r\n\r\nThey were only a few meters from the archway when a stir of movement\r\ncame from its shadow--the first life Kennon had seen since they\r\ndescended from the ship. In this furnace heat even the air was quiet.\r\nTwo women came out of the darkness, moving with quiet graceful steps\r\nacross the blistering hot concrete. They were naked except for a\r\nloincloth, halter, and sandals and so nearly identical in form and\r\nfeature that Kennon took them to be twins. Their skins were burned a\r\ndeep brown that glistened in the yellow sun light.\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. It was none of his business how his employer ran his\r\nhousehold or what his servants wore or didn’t wear. Santos was a planet\r\nof nudists, and certainly this hot sun was fully as brilliant as the one\r\nwhich warmed that tropical planet In fact, he could see some virtue in\r\nwearing as little as possible. Already he was perspiring.\r\n\r\nThe two women walked past them toward the airboat. Kennon turned to\r\nlook at them and noticed with surprise that they weren’t human. The long\r\ntails curled below their spinal bases were adequate denials of human\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\n“Humanoids!” he gasped. “For a moment I thought-”\r\n\r\n“Gave you a start-eh?” Alexander chuckled. “It always does when a\r\nstranger sees a Lani for the first time. Well--now you’ve seen some of\r\nthe livestock what do you think of them?”\r\n\r\n“I think you should have hired a medic.”\r\n\r\nAlexander shook his head. “No--it wouldn’t be reason able or legal.\r\nYou’re the man for the job.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve no experience with humanoid types. We didn’t cover that phase\r\nin our studies--and from their appearance they’d qualify as humans\r\nanywhere if it weren’t for those tails!”\r\n\r\n“They’re far more similar than you think,” Alexander said. “It just goes\r\nto show what parallel evolution can do. But there are differences.”\r\n\r\n“I never knew that there was indigenous humanoid life on Kardon,” Kennon\r\ncontinued. “The manual says nothing about it.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally. They’re indigenous only to this area.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“That’s impossible. Species as highly organized as that simply don’t\r\noriginate on isolated islands.”\r\n\r\n“This was a subcontinent once,” Alexander said. “Most of it has been\r\ninundated. Less than a quarter of a million years ago there was over a\r\nhundred times the land area in this region than exists today. Then the\r\nocean rose. Now all that’s left is the mid continent plateau and a few\r\nmountain tops. You noted, I suppose, that this is mature topography\r\nexcept for that range of hills to the east. The whole land area at the\r\ntime of flooding was virtually a peneplain. A rise of a few hundred feet\r\nin the ocean level was all that was needed to drown most of the land.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Yes, it’s possible that life could have developed here under\r\nthose conditions. A peneplain topography argues permanence for hundreds\r\nof millions of years.”\r\n\r\n“You have studied geology?” Alexander asked curiously. “Only as part of\r\nmy cultural base,” Kennon said. “Merely a casual acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“We think the Lani were survivors of that catastrophe--and with their\r\nprimitive culture they were unable to reach the other land masses,”\r\n Alexander shrugged. “At any rate they never established themselves\r\nanywhere else.”\r\n\r\n“How did you happen to come here?”\r\n\r\n“I was born here,” Alexander said. “My grandfather discovered this world\r\nbetter than four hundred years ago. He picked this area because it all\r\ncould be comfortably included in Discovery Rights. It wasn’t until years\r\nafterward that he realized the ecological peculiarities of this region.”\r\n\r\n“He certainly capitalized on them.”\r\n\r\n“There was plenty of opportunity. The plants and animals here are\r\ndifferent from others in this world. Like Australia in reverse.”\r\n\r\nKennon looked blank, and Alexander chuckled. “Australia was a\r\nsubcontinent on Earth,” he explained. “Its ecology, however, was\r\nexceedingly primitive when compared with the rest of the planet. Flora’s\r\non the contrary, was--and is--exceedingly advanced when compared with\r\nother native life forms on Kardon.”\r\n\r\n“Your grandfather stumbled on a real bonanza,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“For which I’m grateful,” Alexander grinned. “It’s made me the biggest\r\noperator in this sector of the galaxy. For practical purposes I own an\r\nindependent nation. There’s about a thousand humans here, and nearly six\r\nthousand Lani. We’re increasing the Lani now, since we found they have\r\ncommercial possibilities. Up to thirty years ago we merely used them for\r\nlabor.”\r\n\r\nKennon didn’t speculate on what Alexander meant. He knew. For practical\r\npurposes, his employer was a slave trader--or would have been if the\r\nnatives were human. As it was, the analogy was so close that it wasn’t\r\nfunny.\r\n\r\nThey entered the fortress, passed through a decontamination chamber that\r\nwould have done credit to an exploration ship, and emerged dressed in\r\ntunics and sandals that were far more appropriate and comfortable in\r\nthis tropical climate.\r\n\r\n“That’s one of Old Doc’s ideas,” Alexander said, gesturing at the door\r\nfrom which they had emerged. “He was a hound for sanitation and he\r\ninfected us with the habit.” He turned and led the way down an arched\r\ncorridor that opened into a huge circular room studded with iris doors.\r\n\r\nKennon sucked his breath in with a low gasp of amazement. The room was\r\na gem of exquisite beauty. The parquet floor was inlaid with rare\r\nhardwoods from a hundred different worlds. Parthian marble veneer\r\ncovered with lacy Van tapestries from Santos formed the walls. Delicate\r\nceramics, sculpture, and bronzes reflected the art of a score of\r\ndifferent civilizations. A circular pool, festooned with lacelike\r\nHalsite ferns, stood in the center of the room, surrounding a polished\r\nblack granite pedestal on which stood an exquisite bronze of four Lani\r\nfemales industriously and eternally pouring golden water from vases held\r\nin their shapely hands. “Beautiful,” Kennon said softly.\r\n\r\n“We like it,” Alexander said.\r\n\r\n“We?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes--I forgot to tell you about the Family,” Alexander said grimly.\r\n“I run Outworld, and own fifty per cent of it. The Family owns the other\r\nfifty. There are eight of them--the finest collection of parasites\r\nin the entire galaxy. At the moment they can’t block me since I also\r\ncontrol my cousin Douglas’s shares. But when Douglas comes of age they\r\nwill be troublesome. Therefore I defer to them. I don’t want to build a\r\nunited opposition. Usually I can get one or more of them to vote with\r\nme on critical deals, but I always have to pay for their support.”\r\n Alexander’s voice was bitter as he touched the dilate button on the iris\r\ndoor beside him. “You’ll have to meet them tonight. There’s five of them\r\nhere now.”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t in the contract,” Kennon said. He was appalled at Alexander.\r\nCivilized people didn’t speak of others that way, even to intimates.\r\n\r\n“It can’t be helped. You must meet them. It’s part of the job.”\r\n Alexander’s voice was grim. “Mother, Cousin Anne, Douglas, and Eloise\r\nlike to play lord of the manor. Cousin Harold doesn’t care--for which\r\nyou should be grateful.”\r\n\r\nThe door dilated, and Alexander ushered Kennon into the room. The Lani\r\nsitting on the couch opposite the door leaped to her feet, her mouth\r\nopening in an O of surprise. Her soft snow-white hair, creamy skin, and\r\nbright china blue eyes were a startling contrast to her black loincloth\r\nand halter. Kennon stared appreciatively.\r\n\r\nHer effect on Alexander, however, was entirely different. His face\r\ndarkened. “You!” he snapped. “What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“Serving, sir,” the Lani said.\r\n\r\n“On whose authority?”\r\n\r\n“Man Douglas, sir.”\r\n\r\nAlexander groaned. “You see,” he said, turning to Kennon. “We\r\nneed someone here with a little sense. Like I was telling you, the\r\nFamily’d”--he stopped abruptly and turned back to the Lani. “Your name\r\nand pedigree,” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Silver Dawn, sir--out of White Magic--platinum experimental\r\ntype--strain four.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so. How long have you been inhouse?”\r\n\r\n“Almost a month, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You’re terminated. Report to Goldie and tell her that Man Alexander\r\nwants you sent back to your group.”\r\n\r\nThe Lani’s eyes widened. “Man Alexander!--You?”\r\n\r\nAlexander nodded.\r\n\r\n“Gosh!” she breathed. “The big boss!”\r\n\r\n“Get moving,” Alexander snapped, “and tell Goldie to report to me in my\r\nquarters.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, right away, sir!” The Lath ran, disappearing through the door\r\nthey had entered with a flash of shapely white limbs.\r\n\r\n“That Douglas!” Alexander growled. “Leave that young fool alone here\r\nfor six months and he’d disrupt the entire operation. The nerve of that\r\nyoung pup--requisitioning an experimental type for household labor. Just\r\nwhat does he think he’s doing?”\r\n\r\nThe question obviously didn’t demand a reply, so Kennon kept discreetly\r\nsilent as Alexander crossed the room to the two doors flanking the\r\ncouch on which the Lani had sat. He opened the left-hand one revealing a\r\nmodern grav-shaft that carried them swiftly to the uppermost level. They\r\nwalked down a short corridor and stopped before another door. It opened\r\ninto a suite furnished with stark functional simplicity. It fitted the\r\nentrepreneur’s outward personality so exactly that Kennon had no doubt\r\nthat this was Alexander’s quarters.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Kennon. Relax while you can,” Alexander said as he dropped\r\ninto a chair and crossed his sandaled feet.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure you have many questions, but they can wait.”\r\n\r\n“You might as well get some rest. You’ll have little enough later. The\r\nFamily will probably put you through the meat grinder, but remember that\r\nthey don’t control this business. You’re my man.”\r\n\r\nKennon had hardly seated himself in another chair when the door opened\r\nand a plump pink-skinned Lani entered. She was considerably older\r\nthan the silver-haired one he had seen earlier, and her round face was\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Goldie,” Alexander said. “I understand Man Douglas has been giving\r\nyou quite a time.”\r\n\r\n“It’s high time you came back, sir,” she said. “Since Old Doc died, Man\r\nDouglas has been impossible. He’s been culling the staff and replacing\r\nthem with empty-headed fillies whose only claim to usefulness is that\r\nthey can fill out a halter. Pretty soon this place will be a pigsty.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take care of that,” Alexander promised. “Now I’d like you to meet\r\nOld Doc’s replacement. This is Dr. Kennon, our new veterinarian.”\r\n\r\n“Pleased, I’m sure,” Goldie said. “You look like a nice man.”\r\n\r\n“He is,” Alexander said, “but he’s just as hard as Old Doc--and he’ll\r\nhave the same powers. Goldie’s the head housekeeper,” Alexander added.\r\n“She’s an expert, and you’d do well to take her advice on assignments.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded.\r\n\r\n“Have a maid bring us a light meal and something to drink,” Alexander\r\nsaid. “Have a couple of porters take Dr. Kennon’s things to Old Doc’s\r\nhouse. Find Man Douglas and tell him I want to see him at once. Tell the\r\nFamily that I’ve arrived and will see them in the Main Lounge at eight\r\ntonight. Tell Blalok I’ll be seeing him at nine. That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” Goldie said and left the room, her tail curling buoyantly.\r\n\r\n“A good Lani,” Alexander commented. “One of the best. Loyal,\r\ntrustworthy, intelligent. She’s been running Alexandria for the past ten\r\nyears, and should be good for at least ten more.”\r\n\r\n“Ten?--how old is she?”\r\n\r\n“Thirty.”\r\n\r\n“Thirty--years?”\r\n\r\nAlexander nodded.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord Lister! I’d have guessed her at least three hundred!”\r\n\r\n“Wrong life scale. Lani only live about one tenth as long as we do.\r\nThey’re mature at twelve and dead at fifty.”\r\n\r\nAlexander sighed. “That’s another difference. Even without agerone we’d\r\nlive to be a hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Have you tried gerontological injections?”\r\n\r\n“Once. They produced death in about two days. Killed five Lani with\r\nthem.” Alexander’s face darkened at an unpleasant memory. “So we don’t\r\ntry any more,” he said. “There are too many differences.” He stretched.\r\n“I’d tell you more about them but it’ll be better to hear it from Evald\r\nBlalok. He’s our superintendent. Steve Jordan can tell you a lot, too.\r\nHe runs the Lani Division. But right now let’s wait for Cousin Douglas.\r\nThe pup will take his time about coming--but he’ll do it in the end.\r\nHe’s afraid not to.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather not,” Kennon said. “It’s poor manners to be injected into a\r\nfamily affair--especially when I’m just one of the employees.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not just one of the employees. You are the Station Veterinarian,\r\nand as such you hold an authority second only to Blalok and myself. You\r\nand Blalok are my hands, ears, and eyes on Flora. You are responsible\r\nto me--and to me alone. While I defer at times to the desires of\r\nthe Family, I do not have to. I run Outworld Enterprises and all the\r\nextensions of that organization. I possess control--and the Family knows\r\nit. My men are respected and furthermore they know everything that goes\r\non.” He smiled icily. “In a way it’s quite a healthy situation. It\r\nkeeps my relatives under control. Somehow they dislike being disciplined\r\nbefore outsiders. Now think no more about it.” Alexander stood up and\r\nwalked over to one of the windows opening onto the broad roof gardens,\r\nand stood looking at the sun-drenched greenery.\r\n\r\n“Odd, isn’t it,” Alexander said, “how beautiful nature is and how simple\r\nthings are in a state of nature. It’s only when man interjects himself\r\nonto a scene that things get complicated. Take Flora for instance.\r\nBefore Grandfather came here, it must have been a pleasant place with\r\nthe simple natives happy in their paradise. But that’s all changed\r\nnow. We have taken over--and they, like other lesser creatures on other\r\nworlds, have been bent to our will and uses. I could pity them, but\r\nbeing human I cannot afford that luxury.”\r\n\r\nKennon understood. He, too, had felt that sensation, that odd tightening\r\nof the throat when he first saw a Varl on Santos. The Varl had been the\r\ndominant life form there until men had come. Now they were just another\r\nanimal added to humanity’s growing list of pets and livestock. The\r\nlittle Varl with their soft-furred bodies and clever six-fingered hands\r\nmade excellent pets and precision workmen. The products of those clever\r\nhands, the tiny instruments, the delicate microminiaturized control\r\ncircuits, the incredibly fine lacework and tapestries, formed the bulk\r\nof Santos’ interstellar trade.\r\n\r\nHe had owned a Varl once and had delighted in its almost human\r\nintelligence. But the Varl weren’t human and there lay their tragedy.\r\nTwo thousand years of human domination had left them completely\r\ndependent on their conquerors. They were merely intelligent animals--and\r\nthat was all they would ever be until the human race changed its\r\ncultural pattern or was overthrown. The one alternative was as unlikely\r\nas the other. Humanity had met some fierce competitors, but none with\r\nits explosive acquisitive nature, and none with its drive to conquer,\r\ncolonize, and rule. And probably it never would.\r\n\r\nThe little Varl were one race among hundreds that had fallen before the\r\nfierceness and the greed of men. But unlike most others, the Varl were\r\nnot combative. Therefore they had survived.\r\n\r\nYet had it been necessary to reduce them to slavery? They would never\r\nbe a threat. Not only were they essentially gentle and noncombative, but\r\ntheir delicate bodies could not stand the strains of spaceflight.\r\nThey were trapped on their world. Why should they be forced into so\r\nsubordinate a role?--Why was humanity so jealous of its dominance\r\nthat no other species could exist except by sufferance? Why after five\r\nthousand years of exploration, invasion, and colonization did the human\r\nrace still consider the galaxy as its oyster, and themselves uniquely\r\nqualified to hold the knife? He hadn’t thought this way since he had\r\ngiven the Varl to his girl friend of the moment, and had blasted off for\r\nBeta. Now the questions returned to haunt him. As a Betan, the haunting\r\nwas even more acute, since Beta had a related problem that was already\r\ntroublesome and would become more acute as the years passed.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged and laid the thought aside as a slim, dark-haired Lani\r\nentered pushing a service cart ahead of her. The two men ate silently,\r\neach busy with his own thoughts. And behind the view wall of Alexander’s\r\napartment Kardon’s brilliant yellow sun sank slowly toward the horizon,\r\nfilling the sky with flaming colors of red and gold, rimmed by the blues\r\nand purples of approaching night. The sunset was gaudy and blatant,\r\nKennon thought with mild distaste, unlike the restful day-end displays\r\nof his homeworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDouglas Alexander was a puffy-faced youngster with small intolerant\r\neyes set in folds of fat above a button nose and a loose-lipped sensual\r\nmouth. There was an odd expression of defiance overlaid with fear on his\r\npudgy features. Looking at him, Kennon was reminded of a frightened dog,\r\nready either to bite or cower.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn’t Douglas who held his eye. It was the two Lani who followed\r\nhim into the room. Every line of their bodies was perfection that spoke\r\nvolumes about generations of breeding for physical elegance. They moved\r\nwith a co-ordinated grace that made Douglas look even more clumsy by\r\ncontrast. And they were identical, twin cream-and-gold works of art.\r\nThey were completely nude--and Kennon for the first time in his life\r\nfully appreciated the beauty of an unclad female. To cover them would\r\nbe sacrilege, and ornaments would only detract from their exquisite\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nKennon knew that he was staring like an idiot. Alexander’s amused smile\r\ntold him that much. With an effort he composed his startled features.\r\n\r\nThe pair looked at him with soft violet eyes--and it was as though some\r\npsychic bathhouse attendant had poured ice water down his spine. For he\r\nhad seen that look before, that liquid introspective look in the velvet\r\neyes of cattle. He shivered. For a moment he had been thinking of them\r\nas human. And somehow the lack of that indefinable some thing called\r\nhumanity robbed them of much of their glamour. They were still\r\nbeautiful, but their beauty had become impersonal.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Don’t take these as representative of the Lani,” Alexander said\r\nsuddenly. “They’re a special case, a very special case.” He glared at\r\nhis cousin. “Damn your impudence,” he said without beat. “I sent for\r\nyou--not your toys. Send them away.”\r\n\r\nDouglas sulkily thrust out his lower lip. “You can’t talk to me like\r\nthat, Cousin Alex,” he began. “I’m just a--”\r\n\r\n“You heard me, Douglas. Out!” Alexander’s voice didn’t rise but it cut\r\nlike a whip.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well,” Douglas said. “I can’t fight you--yet.” He turned to\r\nthe humanoids. “You heard the Boss-man. Go home.”\r\n\r\nThe two nodded in unison and departed quickly. Somehow Kennon got the\r\nimpression that they were happy to leave.\r\n\r\n“Just wait,” Douglas said. “You can’t boss me forever. Just wait. I’ll\r\nreach my majority in five years. I can vote my shares then--and then\r\nI’ll fix you. You won’t be so high and mighty then, Mr. Big. I’ll throw\r\nin with the rest of the Family. They don’t like you too much.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t hold your breath waiting for the Family to help you,” Alexander\r\nsaid. “They wouldn’t have anyone else but me handle the finances. They\r\nlove money too much. And until you get your inheritance remember one\r\nthing--I’m master here.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” Douglas said, and then curiously--“Who’s the oddball?” He\r\ngestured at Kennon with a pudgy thumb.\r\n\r\n“Our new veterinarian, Dr. Kennon.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--great! Now you tell me!”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing like making a good first impression,” Alexander said\r\nwith ironic emphasis. “I hope he cuts you off from the Lani. He’ll have\r\nthe authority to do it, since he’s taking Old Doc’s place.”\r\n\r\n“He can’t. I’m an owner. I own-”\r\n\r\n“You own nothing. You’re a minor. And under the terms of Grandfather’s\r\nwill, you’ll own nothing except an allowance until you reach legal age.\r\nAnd that brings me to the reason I brought you here. Just when did you\r\ngain the right to reorganize the household staff? Just when did you get\r\nthe power to interfere with the experimental program?”\r\n\r\nDouglas flushed dull red and bit his lip. “Do we have to go into this in\r\nfront of strangers?”\r\n\r\n“Kennon’s my agent,” Alexander said coldly, “and he might as well learn\r\nabout you and the others from the start.”\r\n\r\n“Well--what do you want him to do--watch me crawl?” Douglas asked\r\nbitterly. “You’ll make me do it. You always do. Do you want me to beg,\r\nto say I was wrong, to promise I won’t do it again?”\r\n\r\n“You’ve done that already,” Alexander said. “Several times. You need a\r\nlesson. I won’t have you meddling with valuable animals.”\r\n\r\n“And what are you going to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“Put you where you can do no more damage. As of tomorrow you’ll go to\r\nOtpen One.”\r\n\r\nDouglas paled. His lips quivered, and his eyes flicked uneasily as\r\nhe watched Alexander’s granite face. “You don’t mean that,” he said\r\nfinally. “You’re joking.”\r\n\r\n“I never joke about business.”\r\n\r\n“But you can’t do that! I’ll tell the Family. They won’t let you.”\r\n\r\n“I already have their consent,” Alexander said. “I obtained it after\r\nyour last escapade. You’ll be happy out there. You can play tin god all\r\nyou like. Master of life and death on a two-acre island. No one will\r\nmind. You can also go to work. No one will mind that, either. And\r\nMullins won’t mind as long as you leave the troops alone. Now get out of\r\nhere and get packed. You’re leaving tomorrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“But cousin Alex--”\r\n\r\n“Move! I’m tired of the sight of you!” Alexander said.\r\n\r\nDouglas turned and shambled out of the room. His ego was thoroughly\r\ndeflated and he seemed more frightened than before. Obviously the Otpens\r\nweren’t the pleasantest place in this world.\r\n\r\n“They’re a military post,” Alexander said. “And Commander Mullins\r\ndoesn’t like Douglas. Can’t say that I blame him. Douglas is a\r\nthoroughly unpleasant specimen, and incidentally quite typical of the\r\nrest of the Family.” Alexander sighed and spread his hands in a gesture\r\nthat combined disgust and resignation. “Sometimes I wonder why I have\r\nbeen cursed with my relatives.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded. The implications behind the empty eyes of Douglas’s Lani\r\nsickened him. There were several ways to produce that expression, all of\r\nthem unpleasant. Hypnoconditioning, the Quiet Treatment, brainburning,\r\ntransorbital leukotomy, lobectomy--all of the products of that diseased\r\nperiod of humanity’s thinking when men tampered with the brains of other\r\nmen in an effort to cure psychic states. Psychiatry had passed that\r\nperiod, at least on the civilized worlds, where even animal experiments\r\nwere frowned upon as unnecessary cruelty.\r\n\r\n“You saw those two Lani,” Alexander said. “Grandfather had them made\r\nthat way as a birthday present for Douglas. He was getting senile. He\r\ndied a year later. You’d think a man would be ashamed to keep things\r\nlike that around--but not Douglas. He likes them.” Alexander’s voice was\r\ntinged with contempt. “He knows they disgust me--so he parades them in.\r\nI could strangle that pup sometimes!”\r\n\r\n“I wondered about it. I wouldn’t like to work for a man who permitted\r\nsuch things.”\r\n\r\n“That was done before I took over. For the past three years there have\r\nbeen no dockings, no mutilations. I can’t see treating a helpless animal\r\nlike that.”\r\n\r\n“I feel better about it,” Kennon said. “I didn’t think you were that\r\nsort.”\r\n\r\n“Understand me,” Alexander said. “I’m always opposed to senseless\r\ncruelty and waste--particularly when it’s dangerous. Docked Lani are the\r\nheight of stupidity. Just because someone wants a pet that is an exact\r\nduplicate of a human being is no reason to risk a court action. Those\r\nLani, and a few others whose tails have been docked, could be a legal\r\nbombshell if they ever left Flora.”\r\n\r\nKennon was jolted. He had been thinking of mental mutilation and\r\nAlexander had been talking physical. Naturally they would be dangerous\r\nproperty. Anyone attempting to sell a docked Lani would probably be\r\nthrown in Detention and charged with slave trading.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever figure the cost of taking a legal action through our court\r\nsystem?” Alexander asked. “Even the small ones set you back four or five\r\nthousand, and a first-class action like a Humanity Trial could cost\r\nover a million. Grandfather found that out. Sure, there are differences\r\nbetween Lani and humans, but a smart lawyer can make them seem trivial\r\nuntil the final test and that would drag on for nearly two years until\r\nall the requirements were satisfied--and by that time the unfavorable\r\npublicity would drop sales to zero. The Family would be on my neck for\r\nlost dividends, and I’d lose much of the control I hold over them.\r\n\r\n“Sure, it’s possible that prehensile tails could be produced by\r\nmutation, but so far as we know it hasn’t happened in human history. As\r\na result, the tail serves as a trade-mark--something that can be easily\r\nrecognized by anyone. So we sell them intact.” Alexander crossed his\r\nlegs and settled back in his chair. “Shocks you, doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded. “Yes,” he admitted. “It does.”\r\n\r\n“I know. You can’t help it. Most of our new employees think the Lani are\r\nhuman--at first. They learn better, but adjustment is always a strain.\r\nThey keep confusing external appearances with the true article. But\r\nremember this--Lani are not human. They’re animals. And on this island\r\nthey’re treated as what they are--no more, no less. They are a part\r\nof our economics and are bred, fed, and managed according to sound\r\nlivestock principles. Despite some of the things you may see here in\r\nAlexandria, don’t forget that. You are a veterinarian. Your job is to\r\nhandle disease problems in animals. Lani are animals. Therefore you will\r\nbe doing your job. I was disappointed in your reaction when you first\r\nsaw them, but I suppose it was natural. At any rate this should clear\r\nthe air.”\r\n\r\n“It does--intellectually,” Kennon admitted. “But the physical\r\nresemblance is so close that it is difficult to accept.”\r\n\r\nAlexander smiled. “Don’t worry. You’ll accept it in time. Now I think\r\nit’s time that you met the Family.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe main salon was crowded. The huge room, glittering with mirrors and\r\ncrystal, floored with thick carpets, and hung with rich drapes, had\r\nsomething of the appearance of a Sarkian harem. Although there were only\r\nfive of the Alexander family present, there were at least twenty\r\nLani whose costumes ranged from the black G string and halter of the\r\nhousehold staff to the utter nudity of Douglas’s playthings. They were\r\nall female, and Kennon wondered for a moment what a male was like.\r\n\r\nBesides Alexander, there were two men and three women: Douglas, still\r\nwith his sulky expression, an older man in his late nineties who looked\r\nlike Douglas’s elder brother, two mature women who could be any age from\r\nfifty to three hundred, and a girl. She might have been thirty--perhaps\r\nyounger, perhaps older, a lean feminine edition of Alexander, with the\r\nsame intriguing face and veiled predatory look. There was a hardness\r\nabout her that was absent in the others. Kennon had the feeling that\r\nwhatever this girl did, she didn’t do it half way.\r\n\r\n“My sister Eloise,” Alexander said in a low voice. “Watch out for her.\r\nShe’s as deadly as a puff adder and she collects men. The other man is\r\nDouglas’s father, Henry. The plump redhead beside him is his wife, Anne.\r\nThe other woman is my mother, Clara, even though Eloise and I don’t look\r\nlike her. We take after Father.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s he?” Kennon whispered.\r\n\r\n“Dead,” Alexander replied. “He was killed twenty years ago.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to present Dr. Jac Kennon, our new veterinarian,” Alexander\r\nsaid into the hush that followed their entrance. The introductions that\r\nfollowed were in proper form, and Kennon was beginning to feel more at\r\nease until Eloise sent one of her Lani with a summons. He looked around\r\nfor Alexander, but the entrepreneur was the center of a three-cornered\r\nargument, hemmed in by Douglas, Henry, and Anne. Henry’s voice was\r\nraised in bitter protest that Alexander was exceeding his authority. He\r\nshrugged. There was no help there.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said, “tell your mistress I’ll be along in a moment.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Doctor,” the Lani said, “but the Woman Eloise says for you to\r\ncome, and she is not accustomed to being disobeyed.”\r\n\r\n“Tell her what I said,” Kennon replied. “I shall be there directly.” He\r\ncrossed to the table and examined it, selecting a cluster of odd purple\r\nfruit which looked more interesting than it tasted. When he had finished\r\nhe walked leisurely over to where Eloise sat.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him angrily. “I am accustomed to being obeyed by my\r\nemployees,” she said coldly. Her dark eyes, oddly like her brother’s,\r\ntraversed his hard body like twin scanners.\r\n\r\nHe returned her appraising stare with one of his own. “I’m not your\r\nemployee,” he said bluntly. “I was hired by your brother, and there’s\r\na full peeper rider on my contract.” His eyes traveled slowly over her\r\ncarefully arranged hair, her make-up, her jewelry at throat and\r\narms, her painted finger- and toenails, and then across the slim\r\nsmall-breasted lines of her body half revealed under her thin\r\nankle-length tunic of Lyranian silk.\r\n\r\n“Satisfied?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“On Beta,” he said bluntly, “your appearance would qualify you for a\r\nparasite camp. Six months of hard labor would do you no end of good.\r\nYou’re soft, lazy, and undisciplined.”\r\n\r\nEloise gasped. “Why, you--” she sputtered.\r\n\r\n“And perhaps next time you’ll learn to be polite,” Kennon continued\r\nimperturbably. “After all, the superficial attributes of good breeding\r\nare not too hard to counterfeit.”\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, Eloise giggled. “You bite, don’t you?” she asked.\r\n“Remind me to remember that.”\r\n\r\n“I shall.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, your actions weren’t good breeding either.”\r\n\r\n“Admitted--but I’ve never pretended to be what I’m not. I’m the son of a\r\nspaceship skipper, and I’m a veterinarian. That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not all. You are also a man.” Her face was sober, “It’s been\r\nsome time since I’ve met one. I’d almost forgotten they existed.”\r\n\r\n“There’s your brother.”\r\n\r\n“Alex?--he’s a money making machine. Come--sit beside me and let’s\r\ntalk.”\r\n\r\n“About what?”\r\n\r\n“You--me--your job, your life--anything you wish?”\r\n\r\n“That line isn’t exactly new,” Kennon grinned.\r\n\r\n“I know,” she admitted, “but it usually works.”\r\n\r\n“I’m immune.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what you think.” Eloise’s eyes were frankly appraising. “I think\r\nI could become interested in you.”\r\n\r\n“I have a job here. I don’t think I would have time to give you the\r\nattention you’d demand.”\r\n\r\n“I get bored easily. It probably wouldn’t be long before I would be\r\ntired of you.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps--and perhaps not, I can’t afford to take the chance.”\r\n\r\n“You seem confident.”\r\n\r\n“You forget. I was a sailor.”\r\n\r\n“And spacemen have a reputation, eh?” Eloise chuckled.\r\n\r\n“At that, you might be right. I remember the first officer of--” she let\r\nthe thought die. “But I became tired of him,” she finished.\r\n\r\nKennon smiled. “I’ve never had that complaint.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you’d like to make the acid test?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” he said. “But not tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow then? Alex will be leaving in the morning. He never stays more\r\nthan a few hours.” Eloise’s eyes were bright, her lips moist and red.\r\n\r\n“I’ll pick the time,” Kennon said--and added to himself, “If ever.”\r\n Despite her wealth Eloise was no different from the port-of-call girls.\r\nIf anything, she was worse since she had enough money to implement her\r\ndesires. They were merely in the trade for business reasons. No--Eloise\r\nwould be something to steer clear of. Alexander was right. She was a\r\nmantrap. He stood up and bowed Betan fashion. “I see your brother is\r\nfree now. He wants to brief me on my duties here. We were discussing it\r\nbefore we entered.”\r\n\r\nEloise pouted. “You can always do that.”\r\n\r\n“You said yourself that Alexander never stays here very long. I would be\r\na poor employee if I delayed him.” He grinned knowingly at her and she\r\nsmiled back with complete understanding.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then. Get your business done. Your pleasure can wait.”\r\n\r\nKennon steered Alexander over to an open window that led to a balcony.\r\n“Whew!” he said. “I see what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a tartar,” Alexander agreed. “I suspect that she’s a\r\nnymphomaniac.”\r\n\r\n“You suspect?” Kennon asked. “By this time you should know. Let’s get\r\nout of here. I’ve had about all of your sister I care to take.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t say as I blame you. I’ll show you to your quarters. Maybe Old Doc\r\nleft a bottle or two, although I suspect the old sinner hung on until\r\nthe last one was empty.”\r\n\r\n“If he had to put up with your relatives as a steady diet, I can’t say\r\nthat I blame him,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“Careful, Doctor. You’re talking about my kinfolk,” Alexander said\r\nwryly. “At that, though, you have a point.” The two men slipped quietly\r\nfrom the room. Apparently none of the Family was conscious of their\r\ndeparture except Eloise, who watched them leave with an enigmatic\r\nexpression on her narrow face.\r\n\r\nThey left the fortress through the rear gate and walked slowly down the\r\nwinding path that led to the cluster of buildings in the valley below.\r\nIt was a beautiful night, calm and clear with the stars shining down\r\nfrom the dark vault of the heavens. The constellations were strange, and\r\nKennon missed the moons. Beta had three, two of which were always in the\r\nsky, but Kardon was moonless. Somehow it gave the sky an empty look.\r\n\r\nA damp coolness rose from the ground as the evening rain evaporated\r\nmistily into the still air. Kennon sniffed the odor of soil and growing\r\nvegetation, clean pleasant odors in contrast to what he had left. In the\r\ndistance a bird called sleepily from one of the fortress turrets and was\r\nanswered by some creature Kennon couldn’t identify. A murmur of blended\r\nsound came from the valley below, punctuated by high-pitched laughter.\r\nSomeone was singing, or perhaps chanting would be a better description.\r\nThe melody was strange and the words unrecognizable. The thin whine\r\nof an atomotor in the fortress’s generating plant slowly built up to a\r\nkeening undertone that blended into the pattern of half-perceived sound.\r\n\r\n“Nice, isn’t it?” Alexander remarked as they rounded another turn on the\r\nswitchback path.\r\n\r\n“Yes. You can’t hear a sound from back there except for that generator.\r\nIt’s almost as though we shut those people out of existence by merely\r\nclosing a door.”\r\n\r\n“I wish it were that simple,” Alexander said. “But doors that can be\r\nclosed can also be opened. Well--think you’ll like it here?”\r\n\r\n“I think so, providing I don’t have to entertain your relatives.”\r\n\r\n“You mean Eloise? Don’t worry about her. She’s as fickle as the wind.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve never seen anyone so frankly predatory,” Kennon said. “She worries\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll all be gone tomorrow--except for Eloise,” Alexander said with\r\nmock comfort. “Douglas is on the Otpens for a year, and the others are\r\noff somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be staying, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“No--I’m afraid I can’t.”\r\n\r\n“I hoped you’d help me get organized. This whole thing has been\r\nsomething of a shock. I was expecting something entirely different.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry--someone has to run the business. But Blalok’ll brief you.\r\nActually he’s more qualified than I. He knows everything worth knowing\r\nabout this place. We’re going past his house in a minute--want to stop\r\nin and see him?”\r\n\r\n“It’s pretty late.”\r\n\r\n“Not for Blalok. He’s a Mystic--a nocturnal. He’s probably doing his\r\nwork now.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we shouldn’t disturb him.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense. He’s used to it. I visit him frequently at night.”\r\n\r\n“Sure--but you’re the boss.”\r\n\r\n“Well--in a sense you are too. At least in the veterinary end of this\r\nbusiness.” Alexander swung sharply to the left and climbed a short\r\nflight of stairs that led to the nearest house. Lights flared on the\r\ndeep porch, and the old-fashioned iris door dilated to frame the black\r\nsilhouette of a stocky, broad-shouldered man.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, sir,” he said. “I was expecting you. That the new vet\r\nwith you?”\r\n\r\n“Your pipeline’s still working, I see,” Alexander said. “Yes, this is\r\nDr. Kennon--Evald Blalok--I wanted you two to meet.”\r\n\r\nKennon liked the gray middle-aged man. He looked honest and competent,\r\na solid quiet man with a craggy face and the deep-set eyes of a Mystic.\r\nHis skin had the typical thickness and pore prominence of the dwellers\r\non that foggy world from which he came. But unlike the natives of Myst,\r\nhis skin was burned a dark brown by Kardon’s sun. He seemed out of place\r\non this tropic world, but Kennon reflected wryly that there was probably\r\nmore than one misplaced human here, himself included.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been going over Station Fourteen’s records with Jordan,” Blalok\r\nsaid as he ushered them into the house. A tall black-haired man rose as\r\nthey entered.\r\n\r\n“Skip the formality, Jordan. Sit down,” Alexander said, “and meet Dr.\r\nKennon--Steve Jordan--Jordan runs the Lani Division.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded acknowledgment as Alexander continued, “What’s this\r\ntrouble at Fourteen?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. We’ve got an epizootic of something. Another youngster\r\ndied this morning, and there’s three more that look pretty bad,\r\njaundice, no appetite, complaining of muscular pains. Same symptoms as\r\ntook the others. The one this morning makes the fourth this month, and\r\nwe’re only half through it.”\r\n\r\n“Are all your losses in this one station?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“No--but it’s worst there.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like losses like that,” Alexander said.\r\n\r\n“Neither do I,” Jordan replied.\r\n\r\n“This isn’t Jordan’s fault, sir,” Blalok said quickly. “As you know, we\r\nhaven’t had a vet for three months.”\r\n\r\n“Two,” Alexander corrected.\r\n\r\n“Three--Old Doc wasn’t around at all the month before he died,” Blalok\r\nsaid. “As a result we’ve got a problem. We need professional help.”\r\n\r\n“Well here he is--use him,” Alexander said. He looked at Kennon, a trace\r\nof amusement on his face. “There’s nothing like getting into things\r\nearly.”\r\n\r\n“Particularly when one comes into them stone cold,” Kennon added. “It’s\r\na poor way to start a career.”\r\n\r\n“We can’t afford to wait,” Jordan said. “We need help.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll see what can be done,” Kennon replied. “Have you saved the body?”\r\n\r\n“Every one of them,” Jordan said. “They’re in the hospital in the\r\nautopsy room.”\r\n\r\n“That was sensible. A post-mortem might give us an answer. Where’s the\r\nhospital?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll show you,” Jordan offered.\r\n\r\n“Count me out,” Alexander said. “I have a weak stomach.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go along if it’s necessary,” Blalok said.\r\n\r\n“There’s a staff there, Old Doc trained them,” Jordan said.\r\n\r\n“Then it shouldn’t be necessary,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\nBlalok sighed with relief and turned to Alexander. “We could check the\r\nrecords while those two are about their bloody work.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather check a long strong drink,” Alexander replied. “What with\r\nthe Family and this, it’s too much to take for one evening.”\r\n\r\nKennon hid a smile. Alexander had a weak spot. He was squeamish. That\r\nwas a good thing to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nJordan opened the door of the two-story building below Blalok’s house.\r\n“This is it,” he said, “just outside your front door. Convenient--no?”\r\n\r\n“Too convenient,” Kennon said, “also too quiet. Isn’t anyone on duty?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t know. Old Doc never kept the place open at night.”\r\n\r\nThere was a stir of movement in the darkness, the lights flashed on,\r\nand a sleepy-eyed Lani blinked at them in the sudden glare. She looked\r\nblankly at Kennon and then brightened as she saw Jordan. “What’s the\r\ntrouble, sir?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing. We want to look at the Lani I sent down this morning--Dr.\r\nKennon would like to inspect the carcass.”\r\n\r\n“You’re the new doctor?” the Lani asked. “Thank goodness you’ve come!\r\nI’ll get the staff. I’ll be back in a moment.” She stepped quickly over\r\nto the switchboard beside the door and punched five buttons. Four more\r\nhumanoids came into the room, followed a little later by a fifth.\r\n\r\n“Where’s the emergency?” one asked.\r\n\r\n“He is--it’s our new doctor.”\r\n\r\n“More females,” Kennon muttered to himself. He turned to Jordan. “Aren’t\r\nthere any males in this crew?”\r\n\r\nJordan stared at him with mild surprise. “No, sir--didn’t you know?\r\nThere are no male Lani.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Just that,” Jordan said. “Only females. There hasn’t been a male on the\r\nisland since Old Man Alexander took over. He killed them all.”\r\n\r\n“But that’s impossible! How do they reproduce?”\r\n\r\n“Ever hear of artificial fertilization?”\r\n\r\n“Sure--but that’s a dead end. The offspring are haploids and they’re\r\nsterile. The line would die out in a generation.”\r\n\r\n“Not the Lani--you can see for yourself. We’ve been using the technique\r\nhere for better than four centuries, and we’re still doing all right.\r\nOver forty generations so far, and from the looks of things we can go on\r\nindefinitely.”\r\n\r\n“But how is it done?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. That’s Alexander’s secret. The Boss-man doesn’t tell us\r\neverything. All I know is that we get results. Old Doc knew how it was\r\ndone, and I suppose you will too, but don’t ask me. I’m dumb.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. Maybe--maybe not. At any rate there was no sense in\r\nbelaboring the point. He turned to the staff. Five of them were the\r\nsame big-boned heavy-framed type that apparently did most of the\r\nmanual labor. The sixth, the late arrival, was an elegant creature, a\r\nbronze-skinned, green-eyed minx with an elfin face half hidden under a\r\nwavy mass of red-brown hair. Unlike the others, she had been docked--and\r\nin contrast to their heavy eyes and sleep-puffed features she was alert\r\nand lively. She flashed him an impish grin, revealing clean white teeth.\r\n\r\nKennon smiled back. He couldn’t help it. And suddenly the tension and\r\nstrangeness was broken. He felt oddly at ease. “Which of you are on\r\nduty?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“All of us,” the redhead replied, “if it’s necessary. What do you want\r\nus to do?”\r\n\r\n“He’s already told me. He wants that last carcass prepped for a\r\npost-mortem,” the nightcall Lani said.\r\n\r\n“Good,” the redhead said. “It’ll be nice to get to work again.” She\r\nturned to face Kennon. “Now, Doctor--would you like to see your office?\r\nOld Doc left a fine collection of notes on Lani anatomy and perhaps you\r\ncould do with a little review.”\r\n\r\n“I could do with a lot of it,” Kennon admitted. “Unless the inner\r\nstructure of a Lani is as similar to human as their outer.”\r\n\r\n“There are differences,” the redhead admitted. “After all, we aren’t\r\nquite alike.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I’d better do some reading,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“You need me any more?” Jordan asked.\r\n\r\n“No--I think not.”\r\n\r\n“Good. I’ll get back. Frankly, I don’t like this any better than Blalok\r\nor the boss, but I’m low man on that pole. See you later.”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled as Jordan left. “Now, let’s get ready for that cadaver,”\r\n he said.\r\n\r\n“Carcass, doctor,” the redhead corrected. “A cadaver is a dead human\r\nbody.” She accented the “human.”\r\n\r\nEven in death there is no equality, Kennon thought. He nodded and\r\nthe Lani led the way to a door which opened into a good-sized office,\r\nliberally covered with bookshelves. An old-fashioned plastic desk, some\r\noffice cybernetics, a battered voicewriter, and a few chairs completed\r\nthe furnishings. The redhead placed several large folio volumes in front\r\nof him and stepped back from the desk as he leafed rapidly through\r\nthe color plates. It was an excellent atlas. Dr. Williamson had been a\r\ncareful and competent workman.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, well fortified with a positional knowledge of\r\nLani viscera, Kennon looked up at the redhead. She was still standing\r\npatiently, a statue of red-gold and bronze.\r\n\r\n“Get a smock and let’s go,” he said. “No--wait a minute.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir?”\r\n\r\n“What’s your name? I don’t want to say ‘Hey you!’”\r\n\r\nShe smiled. “It’s Copper Glow--want my pedigree too?”\r\n\r\n“No--it wouldn’t mean anything to me. Do they call you Copper or Glow?\r\nor both?”\r\n\r\n“Just Copper, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Copper--let’s get going.”\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe body of the dead Lani lay on the steel table, waxy and yellowish in\r\nthe pitiless light of the fluorescents. She had been hardly more than a\r\nchild. Kennon felt a twinge of pity--so young--so young to die. And as\r\nhe looked he was conscious of another feeling.\r\n\r\nIt had been an open secret among his classmates that he had refused\r\nan offer to study human medicine because of his aversion to dissecting\r\ncadavers. The sarcoplastic models were all right, but when it came to\r\nflesh, Kennon didn’t have the stomach for it. And now, the sight of the\r\ndead humanoid brought back the same cold sweat and gut-wrenching nausea\r\nthat had caused him to turn to veterinary medicine eight years ago.\r\n\r\nHe fought the spasms back as he approached the table and made the\r\nexternal examination. Icterus and a swollen abdomen--the rest was\r\nessentially normal. And he knew with cold certainty that he could not\r\nlay a scalpel edge upon that cold flesh. It was too human, too like his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready, Doctor?” the Lani standing across the table from him\r\nasked. “Shall I expose the viscera?”\r\n\r\nKennon’s stomach froze. Of course! He should have realized! No\r\npathologist did his own dissection. He examined. And that he could do.\r\nIt was the tactile, not the visual sensations that upset him. He nodded.\r\n“The abdominal viscera first,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe Lani laid back the skin and musculature with bold, sure strokes.\r\nAn excellent prosectress, Kennon thought. Kennon pointed at the swollen\r\nliver and the Lani deftly severed its attachments and laid the organ\r\nout for inspection. The cause of death was obvious. The youngster had\r\nsuccumbed to a massive liver-fluke infestation. It was the worst he\r\nhad ever seen. The bile ducts were thick, calcified and choked with\r\nliterally thousands of the gray-green leaf-shaped trematodes.\r\n\r\n“Let’s look at the others,” he said.\r\n\r\nTwo more post-mortems confirmed the diagnosis. Except for minor\r\ndifferences, the lesions were identical. He removed a few of the flukes\r\nand set them aside for further study.\r\n\r\n“Well that’s that,” he said. “You can clean up now.”\r\n\r\nHe had found the criminal, and now the problem assumed the fascinating\r\nqualities of a crime hunt. Now he must act to prevent further murders,\r\nto reconstruct the crime, to find the modus operandi, to track the fluke\r\nto its source, and to execute it before it could do more harm.\r\n\r\nPhotographs and tri-dis would have to be taken, the parasite would have\r\nto be identified and its sensitivity to therapy determined. Studies\r\nwould have to be made on its life cycle, and the means by which it\r\ngained entrance to its host. It wouldn’t be simple, because this\r\ntrematode was probably Hepatodirus hominis, and it was tricky. It\r\nadapted, like the species it parasitized.\r\n\r\nKennon leaned back from the microscope and studied the illustrations in\r\nthe parasitology text. No matter how much Hepatodirus changed its life\r\ncycle, it could not change its adult form. The arrangements of the\r\nsuckers and genital structures were typical. Old Doc’s library on\r\nparasites was too inadequate for more than diagnosis. He would have to\r\nwait for his own books to be uncrated before he could do more than apply\r\nsymptomatic treatment. He sighed and rose slowly to his feet. Tomorrow\r\nwas going to be a busy day.\r\n\r\nThe door opened behind him and Copper slipped quietly into the office.\r\nShe looked at him curiously, a faint half-shy smile on her face.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready to fill out the autopsy protocol? It’s customary.”\r\n\r\n“It’s also customary to knock on a door before entering.”\r\n\r\n“Is it? Old Doc never mentioned it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not Old Doc.”\r\n\r\n“No, you’re not,” she admitted. “You’re much younger--and far more\r\nbeautiful. Old Doc was a fat, gray old man.” She paused and eyed Kennon\r\nappraisingly with a look on her pointed face that was the virtual twin\r\nof Eloise’s. “I think I’ll like working for you if you’re as nice as you\r\nare pretty.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t call a man beautiful or pretty!” Kennon exploded.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“It just isn’t done.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a funny human,” she said. “I called Old Doc beautiful, and he\r\ndidn’t mind.”\r\n\r\n“That’s different. He was an old man.”\r\n\r\n“What difference does that make?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like it,” Kennon said, hitting on the perfect answer.\r\n\r\nShe stiffened. “I’m sorry, Doctor. I won’t do it again.” She looked down\r\nat him, head cocked sideways. “I guess I have a lot to learn about you.\r\nYou’re much different from Old Doc. He didn’t snap at me.” She paused\r\nfor a moment, then drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\nKennon blinked.\r\n\r\n“About that report,” she said. “Regulations require that each\r\npost-mortem be reported promptly and that a record of the Lani concerned\r\nbe posted in the death book together with all pertinent autopsy data.\r\nMan Blalok is very fussy about proper records.” She drew one of the\r\nchairs to a spot beside the desk and sat down, crossed her long legs,\r\nand waited expectantly.\r\n\r\nKennon’s mouth was suddenly dry. This situation was impossible. How in\r\nthe name of Sir Arthur Fleming could he dictate a coldly precise report\r\nwith a naked redhead sitting beside him? “Look,” he said. “I won’t need\r\nyou. I can operate a voicewriter. You can pick up the material later and\r\ntranscribe it.”\r\n\r\nHer face fell. “You don’t like me,” she said, her green eyes filling\r\nwith quick tears. “Old Doc never--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn Old Doc!” Kennon snapped. “And stop that sniveling--or get\r\nout. Better yet--get out and stop sniveling!”\r\n\r\nShe leaped to her feet and fled.\r\n\r\nKennon swore. There was no reason for him to act that way. He had\r\nbeen more brutal than necessary. But the girl--no, the Lani--was\r\ndisconcerting. He felt ashamed of himself. He had behaved like a\r\nprimitive rather than a member of one of the oldest human civilizations\r\nin the galaxy. He wouldn’t bark at a dog that way. He shook his head.\r\nProbably he was tired. Certainly he was irritable, and unclad females\r\nvirtually indistinguishable from human weren’t the most soothing objects\r\nto contemplate.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if his exasperation was real or merely a defense mechanism.\r\nFirst Eloise, and then this! Confound it! He was surrounded! He felt\r\ntrapped. And it wasn’t because he’d been away from women too long. A\r\nweek was hardly that. He grinned as he recalled the blonde from Thule\r\naboard the starship. Now there was a woman, even though her ears were\r\npointed and her arms were too long. She didn’t pressure a man. She let\r\nhim make the advances.\r\n\r\nHe grinned. That was it. He was on the defensive. He was the one who was\r\nbeing pursued--and his male ego had revolted. He shrugged and turned\r\nhis attention to the autopsy report, but it was hopeless. He\r\ncouldn’t concentrate. He jotted a few notes and dropped them on the\r\ndesk--tomorrow would be time enough. What he needed now was a stiff\r\ndrink and eight hours’ sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nKennon stopped at Blalok’s house long enough to tell the superintendent\r\nwhat was causing the trouble. Blalok scowled. “We’ve never had flukes\r\nhere before,” he said. “Why should they appear now?”\r\n\r\n“They’ve been introduced,” Kennon said. “The thing that bothers me is\r\nhow Dr. Williamson missed them.”\r\n\r\n“The old man was senile,” Blalok said. “He was nearly blind the last six\r\nmonths of his life. I wouldn’t doubt that he let his assistants do most\r\nof his work, and they could have missed them.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, but the lesions are easy to see. At any rate, the culprit is\r\nknown now.”\r\n\r\n“Culprit?”\r\n\r\n“Hepatodirus hominis--the human liver fluke. He’s a tricky little\r\nfellow--travels almost as far as men do.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad it’s your problem, not mine. All I can remember about flukes\r\nis that they’re hard to eradicate.”\r\n\r\n“Particularly H. hominis.”\r\n\r\n“You can tell me about it later. Right now Mr. Alexander’s over at\r\nOld--your house. Probably he’s looking for you.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s Jordan?”\r\n\r\n“He went up to Station Fourteen. We’ll see him tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll say good night then,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you’re here. It’s a load off my shoulders. See you tomorrow.”\r\n Blalok waved a friendly good night and left the lights on long enough\r\nfor Kennon to make his way to his quarters.\r\n\r\nAlexander was seated in a heavily upholstered chair listening to a taped\r\nsymphony in the stereo, his eyes half closed, an expression of peace\r\non his face. An elderly Lani stood beside him. It was a comfortable\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThe humanoid saw Kennon and gasped, a tiny indrawn sound of surprise.\r\nAlexander’s eyes snapped open. “Oh--it’s you,” he said. “Don’t worry,\r\nKara--it’s your new doctor.”\r\n\r\nKara smiled. “You startled me,” she said. “I was dreaming.”\r\n\r\n“On your feet?” Alexander interjected idly.\r\n\r\n“I should have known you at once, Doctor. There’s talk about you all\r\nover the yards, ever since you arrived.”\r\n\r\n“They know what is going on around here better than any of us,”\r\n Alexander chuckled. “The grapevine is amazingly efficient. Well--what’s\r\nthe story?”\r\n\r\n“Liver fluke.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm--not good.”\r\n\r\n“I think it can be stopped. I looked at the records. It doesn’t seem to\r\nhave been here too long.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you’re right. How long will it take?”\r\n\r\n“Several months, maybe a year, maybe more. I can’t say. But I’ll try to\r\nclean it up as quickly as possible. I’m pretty sure of the fluke, and\r\nit’s a hard one to control.”\r\n\r\n“Hepatodirus?”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded.\r\n\r\n“That’s an offworld parasite, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. It originated on Santos. Parasitized the Varl originally, but\r\nliked humans better. It’s adapted to a hundred different planetary\r\nenvironments, and it keeps spreading. It’s a real cutie--almost\r\nintelligent the way it behaves. But it can be licked.”\r\n\r\n“Good--get on it right away.”\r\n\r\n“I’m starting tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Fine--I thought you’d be the right man. Kara! Fix the doctor a drink.\r\nWe might as well have a nightcap--then I’ll go back to the house and\r\nlisten to Henry and Anne’s screams about poor mistreated Douglas, and\r\nthen back to Albertsville tomorrow. Duty and the credits call.”\r\n\r\nWith mild surprise, Kennon realized that Alexander was drunk. Not\r\nobnoxiously, but enough to change his character. Intoxicated, he was a\r\nfriendlier person. If there was any truth in the ancient cliche\r\nabout alcohol bringing out a man’s true character, then Alexander was\r\nbasically a very nice person indeed.\r\n\r\n“Well--here’s your home for the next five years,” Alexander said. “Eight\r\nrooms, two baths, a freshener, and three Lani to keep the place running.\r\nYou’ve got it made.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps--we’ll see when we tackle this fluke infestation. Personally, I\r\ndon’t think I’m going to have an easy time. Tomorrow I’m going to be up\r\nto my neck in trouble trying to save your profits.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll do it. I have confidence in you.”\r\n\r\n“I still think you should have hired a medic.”\r\n\r\n“This isn’t all of your job,” Alexander said. “And besides I can’t\r\nafford to do it. Oh--not the money, but it might be admitting that the\r\nLani might be human. And we’ve gone to a great deal of trouble to prove\r\nthey’re not.” He shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “There’s a story\r\nbehind this.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t doubt it.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe it’d be better if I told it. It goes back over four centuries.\r\nGrandfather was a clever man. After he had secured this island he\r\nbecame worried about the surviving Lani. He didn’t want to be accused\r\nof genocide, since the Lani were so human in appearance. So he had his\r\nmedical officer make a few autopsies. The M.D. reported that while there\r\nwas similarity, the Lani were probably not human.\r\n\r\n“That was enough for Grandfather. He requested a Court of Inquiry. The\r\ncourt was sitting in Halsey and the hearing was private. Even so, it\r\nleaked and Grandfather was highly unpopular for a time until the lab\r\nreports came in. It cost him over eight hundred Ems and nearly two\r\nyears’ time to finish the case, but when it was over the Lani were\r\ndeclared alien, and Grandfather had ironclad discovery rights.\r\n\r\n“They really put him through the mill. Grandfather furnished the bodies\r\nand three court-appointed M.O.’s went through them with microscopes.\r\nThey didn’t miss a thing. Their reports are so detailed that they’re\r\nclassics of their kind. They’re almost required reading for anyone\r\nwho wants to learn Lani structure and function. The court rendered\r\nan interim decision that the Lani were nonhuman, and armed with this,\r\nGrandfather prepared the final tests which were run by a team of\r\ncourt-appointed medics and biologists, who made in vitro and live tests\r\non a number of Lani female prisoners. The tests ran for over two years\r\nand were totally negative. So the Alexander family acquired Flora and\r\nthe Otpens, and a legal status.” Alexander stood up. “Well--that’s a\r\ncapsule summary. The records are in the library if you’d care to check\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Just to prove we’re honest.” He moved carefully toward the door, opened\r\nit, and disappeared into the night.\r\n\r\nSilently Kennon watched him descend the porch steps. He seemed steady\r\nenough. For a moment Kennon debated whether he should see him home--and\r\nthen decided against it. If Alexander needed help he’d have asked for\r\nit. As it was, it was better to leave things alone. Certainly he didn’t\r\nknow Alexander well enough to act as a guardian. He turned back to the\r\nliving area. The stereo was playing something soft and nostalgic as\r\nKennon sank into the chair Alexander had vacated. He let his body relax.\r\nIt had been as full a day as he had ever spent filled with changes\r\nso abrupt that they were exhausting. He felt confused. There were no\r\nprecedents he could apply. Neither his studies nor his travels had\r\nprepared him for living in a situation like this.\r\n\r\nLegally and biologically the Lani weren’t human. But they were\r\nintelligent, upright, bipedal mammals whose morphology was so close to\r\nman’s that it had taken the ultimate test to settle their status. And\r\nbeing a Betan, Kennon was suspicious of the accuracy of that ultimate\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nBut the Brotherhood of Man was based upon it. The feeling of unity that\r\npervaded mankind’s expanding empire was its product. From almost the\r\nbeginning of mankind’s leap to the stars it had been recognized that men\r\nmust help each other or perish. The spirit of co-operation against the\r\ncommon enmity of alien worlds and cultures transcended the old petty\r\nrivalries on Earth. Men--all men--were brothers in arms.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Brotherhood was born--and the concept born of necessity\r\ndeveloped its muscles in a thousand battles on a thousand hostile\r\nworlds. And ultimately it evolved into the only form of central\r\nauthority that men would accept. Yet basically it was not a government.\r\nIt was an attitude of mind. Men accepted its decisions as they would\r\naccept the rulings of a family council, and for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nThe Brotherhood laid down certain rules but it did not attempt to\r\nenforce them. After all, it didn’t need to. It also arbitrated disputes,\r\nadmitted new worlds to membership, and organized concerted human effort\r\nagainst dangerous enemies. And that was all. Yet in its sphere the\r\nauthority of the Brotherhood was absolute.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was only one criterion for membership in the\r\nBrotherhood--membership in the human race. No matter how decadent or\r\nprimitive a population might be, if it was human it was automatically\r\neligible for Brotherhood--a free and equal partner in the society of\r\nhuman worlds.\r\n\r\nKennon doubted that any nonhuman race had ever entered the select circle\r\nof humanity, although individuals might have done so. A docked Lani, for\r\ninstance, would probably pass unquestioned as a human, but the Lani race\r\nwould not. In consequence they and their world were fair prey, and had\r\nbeen attacked and subjugated.\r\n\r\nOf course, proof of inhumanity was seldom a problem. Most alien life\r\nforms were obviously alien. But there were a few--like the Lani--where\r\nsimilarities were so close that it was impossible to determine their\r\nstatus on the basis of morphology alone. And so the Humanity Test had\r\ncome into being.\r\n\r\nEssentially it was based upon species compatibility--on the concept that\r\nlike can interbreed with like. Tests conducted on every inhabited world\r\nin the Brotherhood had proven this conclusively. Whatever changes had\r\ntaken place in the somatic characteristics of mankind since the Exodus,\r\nthey had not altered the compatibility of human germ plasm. Man could\r\ninterbreed with man--aliens could not. The test was simple. The results\r\nwere observable. And what was more important, everyone could understand\r\nit. No definition of humanity could be more simple or direct.\r\n\r\nBut was it accurate?\r\n\r\nLike other Betans, Kennon wondered. It was--so far--probably. The\r\nqualifying phrases were those of the scientist, that strange breed that\r\nrefuses to accept anything as an established fact until it is proven\r\nbeyond a shadow of a doubt. After all, the human race had been\r\nspaceborne for only six thousand years--scarcely time for any real\r\ndifferences to develop. But physical changes had already appeared--and\r\nit would only be a question of time before these would probably be\r\nfollowed by genetic changes. And in some groups the changes might be\r\nextensive enough to make them genetic strangers to the rest of humanity.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen then? No one knew. Actually no one bothered to think\r\nabout it except for a few far-seeing men who worried as they saw.\r\n\r\nProbably.\r\n\r\nMight.\r\n\r\nPossibly.\r\n\r\nIf.\r\n\r\nFour words. But because of them the Betans were slowly withdrawing from\r\nthe rest of humanity. Already the radiations of Beta’s variant-G sun had\r\nproduced changes in the population. Little things like tougher\r\nepidermis and depilation of body hair--little things that held alarming\r\nimplications to Beta’s scientists, and to Beta’s people. Not too many\r\ngenerations hence a Betan outside his home system would be a rarity,\r\nand in a few millennia the Betan system itself would be a closed enclave\r\npeopled by humans who had deviated too far from the basic stock to\r\nmingle with it in safety.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Brotherhood itself might be changed by that time, but\r\nthere was no assurance that this would happen. And mankind had a history\r\nof dealing harshly with its mutants. So Beta would play it safe.\r\n\r\nKennon wondered if there were other worlds in the Brotherhood that had\r\ncome to the same conclusion. Possibly there were. And possibly there\r\nwere worlds where marked deviations had occurred. There wasn’t a year\r\nthat passed that didn’t bring some new human world into the Brotherhood,\r\nand many of these had developed from that cultural explosion during the\r\nFirst Millennium known as the Exodus, where small groups of colonists in\r\ninadequate ships set out for unannounced goals to homestead new worlds\r\nfor man. Some of these survived, and many were being discovered even\r\nat this late date. But so far none had any difficulty in proving their\r\nhuman origin.\r\n\r\nThe Lani, conceivably, could have been descendants of one of these\r\ngroups, which probably explained the extreme care the Brotherhood\r\ncourts had taken with their case. But they had failed the test, and\r\nwere declared animals. Yet it was possible that they had mutated beyond\r\ngenetic compatibility. If they had, and if it were proved, here was a\r\ntest case that could rock the galaxy--that could shake the Brotherhood\r\nto its very foundations--that could force a re-evaluation of the\r\ncriteria of humanity.\r\n\r\nKennon grinned. He was a fine employee. Here he was, less than a full\r\nday on the job, dreaming how he could ruin his employer, shake the\r\nfoundation of human civilization, and force ten thousand billion humans\r\nto change their comfortable habit patterns and their belief in the\r\nunchangeable sameness of men. He was, he reflected wryly, an incurable\r\nromantic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n“Wake up, Doctor, it’s six A.M.” A pleasant voice cut through Kennon’s\r\nslumber. He opened one eye and looked at the room. For a moment the\r\nstrange surroundings bothered him, then memory took over. He stirred\r\nuncomfortably, looking for the owner of the voice.\r\n\r\n“You have your morning calls at seven, and there’s a full day ahead,”\r\n the voice went on. “I’m sorry, sir, but you should get up.” The voice\r\ndidn’t sound particularly sorry.\r\n\r\nIt was behind him, Kennon decided. He rolled over with a groan of\r\nprotest and looked at his tormentor. A gasp of dismay left his lips,\r\nfor standing beside the bed, a half smile on her pointed face, was\r\nCopper--looking fresh and alert and as disturbing as ever.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t right, Kennon thought bitterly, to be awakened from a sound\r\nsleep by a naked humanoid who looked too human for comfort. “What are\r\nyou doing here?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“I’m supposed to be here,” Copper said. “I’m your secretary.” She\r\ngrinned and flexed a few curves of her torso.\r\n\r\nKennon was silent.\r\n\r\n“Is there anything wrong?” she asked.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Kennon was tempted to tell her what was wrong--but he held\r\nhis tongue. She probably wouldn’t understand. But there was one thing\r\nhe’d better settle right now. “Now look here, young lady--” he began.\r\n\r\n“I’m not a lady,” Copper interrupted before he could continue. “Ladies\r\nare human. I’m a Lani.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” Kennon growled. “Lani or human, who cares? But do you have\r\nto break into a man’s bedroom and wake him in the middle of the night?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t break in,” she said, “and it isn’t the middle of the night.\r\nIt’s morning.”\r\n\r\n“All right--so it’s morning and you didn’t break in. Then how in\r\nHalstead’s sacred name did you get here?”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I sleep next door,” she said jerking a thumb in the direction of an\r\nopen door in the side wall. “I’ve been there ever since you dismissed me\r\nlast night,” she explained.\r\n\r\nThe explanation left Kennon cold. The old cliche about doing as the\r\nSantosians do flicked through his mind. Well, perhaps he would in\r\ntime--but not yet. The habits of a lifetime couldn’t be overturned\r\novernight. “Now you have awakened me,” he said, “perhaps you’ll get out\r\nof here.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I want to get dressed.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll help you.”\r\n\r\n“You will not! I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I’ve been\r\ndressing myself for years. I’m not used to people helping me.”\r\n\r\n“My--what a strange world you must come from. Haven’t you ever had a\r\nLani before?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You poor man.” Her voice was curiously pitying. “No one to make you\r\nfeel like the gods. No one to serve you. No one to even scrub your\r\nback.”\r\n\r\n“That’s enough,” Kennon said. “I can scrub my own back.”\r\n\r\n“How?--you can’t reach it.”\r\n\r\nKennon groaned.\r\n\r\n“Weren’t there any Lani on your world?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“No wonder you left it. It must be quite primitive.”\r\n\r\n“Primitive!” Kennon’s voice was outraged. “Beta has one of the highest\r\ncivilizations in the Brotherhood!”\r\n\r\n“But you don’t have Lani,” she said patiently. “So you must be\r\nprimitive.”\r\n\r\n“Halstead, Fleming, and Ochsner!” Kennon swore. “Do you believe that?”\r\n\r\n“Naturally, isn’t it obvious? You can’t possibly be civilized unless you\r\ntake responsibility for intelligent life other than your own race.\r\nUntil you face up to your responsibilities you are merely a member of a\r\ndominant race, not a civilized one.”\r\n\r\nKennon’s reply caught in his throat. His eyes widened as he looked at\r\nher, and what he was about to say remained unspoken. “Out of the mouths\r\nof humanoids--” he muttered oddly.\r\n\r\n“What does that mean?” Copper asked.\r\n\r\n“Forget it,” Kennon said wildly. “Leave me alone. Go put on some\r\nclothes. You embarrass me.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go,” Copper said, “but you’ll have to be embarrassed. Only\r\nhousehold Lani wear cloth.” She frowned, two vertical furrows dividing\r\nher dark brows. “I’ve never understood why inhouse Lani have to be\r\ndisfigured that way, but I suppose there’s some reason for it. Men\r\nseldom do anything without a reason.”\r\n\r\nKennon shook his head. Either she was grossly ignorant, which he\r\ndoubted, or she was conditioned to the eyeballs.\r\n\r\nThe latter was more probable. But even that was doubtful. Her trenchant\r\nremark about civilization wasn’t the product of a conditioned mind. But\r\nwhy was he worrying about her attitudes? They weren’t important--she\r\nwasn’t even human. He shook his head. That was a sophistry. The fact\r\nthat she wasn’t human had nothing to do with the importance of her\r\nattitude. “I suppose there is a reason,” he agreed. “But I don’t know\r\nit. I haven’t been here long enough to know anything about such things.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded. “That does make a difference,” she admitted. “Many new\r\nmen are bothered at first by the fact that we Lani are naked, but they\r\nadjust quickly. So will you.” She smiled as she turned away. “You see,”\r\n she added over her shoulder as she left the room, “we’re not human.\r\nWe’re just another of your domestic animals.”\r\n\r\nWas there laughter in her voice? Kennon wasn’t sure. His sigh was\r\ncomposed of equal parts of relief and exasperation as he slipped out of\r\nbed and began to dress. He’d forgo the shower this morning. He had no\r\ndesire for Copper to appear and offer to scrub his back. In his present\r\nstate of mind he couldn’t take it. Possibly he’d get used to it in time.\r\nPerhaps he might even like it. But right now he wasn’t acclimatized.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“Man Blalok called,” Copper said as she removed the breakfast dishes.\r\n“He said that he’d be right over to pick you up. He wants to show you\r\nthe operation.” “When did he call?”\r\n\r\n“About ten minutes ago. I told him that you were at breakfast. He said\r\nhe’d wait.” She disappeared in the direction of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“There’s a nightmare quality to this,” Kennon muttered as he slipped his\r\narms into the sleeves of his tunic and closed the seam tabs. “I have\r\nthe feeling that I’m going to wake up any minute.” He looked at his\r\nreflection in the dresser mirror, and his reflection looked worriedly\r\nback. “This whole thing has an air of plausible unreality: the\r\nadvertisement, the contract, this impossible island that raises\r\nhumanoids as part of the livestock.” He shrugged and his mirrored image\r\nshrugged back. “But it’s real, all right. No dream could possibly be\r\nthis detailed. I wonder how I’m going to take it for the next five\r\nyears? Probably not too well,” he mused silently. “Already I’m talking\r\nto myself. Without even trying, that Lani Copper can make me feel like a\r\nSarkian.” He nodded at his image.\r\n\r\nThe Sarkian analogy was almost perfect, he decided. For on that grimly\r\nbackward world females were as close to slaves as the Brotherhood would\r\npermit; raised from birth under an iron regimen designed to produce\r\ncomplaisant mates for the dominant males. Probably that was the reason\r\nSark was so backward. The men, having achieved domestic tranquillity,\r\nhad no desire to do anything that would disturb the status quo. And\r\nsince no Sarkian woman under any conceivable circumstances would annoy\r\nher lordly master with demands to produce better mousetraps, household\r\ngadgetry, and more money, the technological development of Sark had come\r\nto a virtual standstill. It took two sexes to develop a civilization.\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. Worlds developed as they did because people were as\r\nthey were, and while passing judgment was still a major human pursuit,\r\nno native of one world had a right to force his customs down the\r\nunwilling throat of another. It would be better to accept his present\r\nsituation and live with it rather than trying to impose his Betan\r\nconception of morality upon Lani that neither understood nor appreciated\r\nit. His business was to treat and prevent animal disease. What happened\r\nto the animals before infection or after recovery was none of his\r\naffair. That was a matter between Alexander and his conscience.\r\n\r\nBlalok was waiting for him, sitting behind the wheel of a square boxy\r\nvehicle that squatted with an air of unpolished efficiency on the\r\ngraveled drive behind his house. He smiled a quick greeting as Kennon\r\napproached. “It’s about time you showed up,” he said. “You’ll have to\r\nget into the habit of rising early on this place. We do most of our work\r\nearly in the morning and late in the afternoon. During the day it’s too\r\nhot to breathe, let alone work. Well, let’s get going. There’s still\r\ntime to visit the outer stations.”\r\n\r\nKennon climbed in and Blalok started the vehicle. “I thought we’d take a\r\njeep today,” he said. “They aren’t very pretty, but they get around.” He\r\nturned onto the surfaced road that ran down the hill toward the hospital\r\nand the complex of red-roofed buildings clustered about it. “About those\r\nflukes,” he said. “You have any plans to get rid of them?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. I’ll have to look the place over. There’s more detective work\r\nthan medicine involved in this.”\r\n\r\n“Detective work?”\r\n\r\n“Sure--we know the criminal, but to squelch him we have to learn his\r\nhangouts, study his modus operandi, and learn how to make his victims\r\nsecure from his activities. Unless we do that, we can treat individuals\r\nfrom now to infinity and all we’ll have is more cases. We have to apply\r\nmodern criminology tactics--eliminate the source of crime--stop up the\r\nsoft spots. In other words, kill the flukes before they enter the Lani.”\r\n\r\n“Old Doc never said anything about this,” Blalok said.\r\n\r\n“Probably he never knew about it. I was looking over the herd books last\r\nnight, and I saw nothing about trematodes, or anything that looked like\r\na parasite pattern until the last few months.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“My guess is that he was one of the first deaths.”\r\n\r\n“You mean this thing attacks human beings?”\r\n\r\n“Preferentially,” Kennon said. “It’s strange, too, because it originated\r\non Santos so far as we know. In fact, some people think that the Varl\r\nbred it for a weapon to use against us before we conquered them. They\r\ncould have done it. Their biological science was of a high enough\r\norder.”\r\n\r\n“But how did it get here?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t know--unless you’ve hired a Santosian or someone else who\r\nwas affected.”\r\n\r\n“We did have a man from Santos. Fellow called Joe Kryla. We had to let\r\nhim go because he was a nudist. It made a bad impression on the Lani.\r\nBut that was over a year ago.”\r\n\r\n“That’s about the right time to build up a good reservoir of infection.\r\nThe fatal cases usually don’t show up before an area is pretty well\r\nseeded.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not so good.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s one thing in our favor. The Lani are pretty well\r\nconcentrated into groups. And so far there doesn’t seem to be any\r\ninfestation outside of Hillside Station--except for two deaths in Lani\r\nrecently sent from there. If we quarantine those stations and work fast,\r\nmay be we can stop this before it spreads all over the island.”\r\n\r\n“That’s fine, but what are you going to do now?”\r\n\r\n“Treat those that show symptoms. There should be some Trematox capsules\r\nat the hospital. If there aren’t we’ll get them. We’ll take the\r\nsick ones back to the hospital area and push therapy and supportive\r\ntreatment. Now that we know the cause, we shouldn’t have any more death\r\nlosses.”\r\n\r\n“Old Doc didn’t treat at the hospital,” Blalok said.\r\n\r\n“I’m not Old Doc.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s going to mess up our operations. We’re using the ward\r\nbuildings to finish training the Lani scheduled for market.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“It’s convenient. Most of the ward space is filled right now.” Blalok\r\nsaid. There was a touch of disgust in his voice.\r\n\r\n“They’re well, aren’t they?” Kennon demanded.\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Then get them out of there.”\r\n\r\n“But I told you-”\r\n\r\n“You told me nothing. The hospital area is needed for something more\r\nthan a training center. Perhaps Old Doc was trained in outcall work, but\r\nI’m not. I work from a hospital. The only things I do on outcalls are\r\ndiagnoses, vaccinations, and emergencies. The rest of the patients come\r\nto the hospital.”\r\n\r\n“This isn’t going to set well with Jordan and the division chiefs.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not my concern,” Kennon said. “I run my business in the best way\r\npossible. The patients are of more concern than the personal comfort of\r\nany straw boss or administrator. You’re the administrator--you calm them\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\n“You have the authority,” Blalok admitted. “But my advice to you is to\r\ngo slow.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” Kennon said. “Not if we want to prevent any more losses.\r\nThere simply won’t be time to run all over the island dosing with\r\nTrematox and taking temperatures, and while that sort of thing is\r\nroutine, it should be supervised. Besides, you’ll see the advantages of\r\nthis method. Soon enough.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” Blalok said as he braked the jeep to a stop in front of the\r\nhospital. “I suppose you’ll want to take some things along.”\r\n\r\n“So I will,” Kennon said. “I’ll be back in a minute.” Kennon slid from\r\nthe seat, leaving Blalok looking peculiarly at his departing back.\r\n\r\nThe minute stretched to nearly ten before Kennon returned followed by\r\ntwo Lani carrying bags which they loaded into the back of the jeep.\r\n“I had to reorganize a little,” Kennon apologized, “some things were\r\nunfamiliar.”\r\n\r\n“Plan on taking them?” Blalok said, jerking a thumb at the two Lani.\r\n\r\n“Not this time. I’m having them fit up an ambulance. They should be busy\r\nmost of the day.”\r\n\r\nBlalok grunted and started the turbine. He moved a lever and the jeep\r\nfloated off the ground.\r\n\r\n“An airboat too,” Kennon remarked. “I wondered why this rig was so\r\nboxy.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a multipurpose vehicle,” Blalok said. “We need them around here\r\nfor fast transport. Most of the roads aren’t so good.” He engaged the\r\ndrive and the jeep began to move. “We’ll go cross country,” he said.\r\n“Hillside’s pretty far out--the farthest station since we abandoned\r\nOlympus.”\r\n\r\nThe air began whistling past the boxlike body of the jeep as Blalok\r\nincreased the power to the drive and set the machine on automatic.\r\n“We’ll get a pretty good cross-section of our operations on this trip,”\r\n he said over the whine of the turbine. “Look down there.”\r\n\r\nThey were passing across a series of fenced pastures and Kennon was\r\nimpressed. The size of this operation was beginning to sink in. It\r\nhadn’t looked so big from the substratosphere in Alexander’s ship, but\r\ndown here close to the ground it was enormous. Fields of grain, wide\r\norchards, extensive gardens. Once they were forced to detour a huge\r\nsupply boat that rose heavily in front of them. Working in the fields\r\nwere dozens of brown-skinned Lani who paused to look up and wave as\r\nthe jeep sped by. Occasional clusters of farm buildings and the low\r\nbarrackslike stations appeared and disappeared behind them.\r\n\r\n“There’s about twenty Lani at each of these stations,” Blalok said,\r\n“They work the farm area under the direction of the stationmaster.”\r\n\r\n“He’s a farmer?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. Usually he’s a graduate of an agricultural school, but we\r\nhave a few who are descendants of the crew of the first Alexander, and\r\nthere’s one old codger who was actually with him during the conquest.\r\nMost of our stationmasters are family men. We feel that a wife and\r\nchildren add to a man’s stability--and incidentally keep him from\r\nfooling around with the Lani.”\r\n\r\nA series of fenced pastures containing hundreds of huge grayish-white\r\nquadrupeds slipped past.\r\n\r\n“Cattle?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes--Earth strain. That’s why they’re so big. We also have sheep and\r\nswine, but you won’t see them on this run.”\r\n\r\n“Any native animals?”\r\n\r\n“A few--and some which are native to other worlds. But they’re\r\nluxury-trade items. The big sale items are beef, pork, and mutton.”\r\n Blalok chuckled. “Did you think that the Lani were our principal\r\nexport?”\r\n\r\n\r\nKennon nodded.\r\n\r\n“They’re only a drop in the bucket. Agriculture--Earth-style\r\nagriculture--is our main source of income. The Lani are valuable\r\nprincipally to keep down the cost of overhead. Virtually all of them\r\nwork right here on the island. We don’t sell more than a hundred a year\r\nless than five per cent of our total. And those are surplus--too light\r\nor too delicate for farm work.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you find a market for all this produce?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“There’s two hundred million people here, and quite a few billion more\r\nin space-train range. We can produce more cheaply than any competitor,\r\nand we can undersell any competition, even full automation.” Blalok\r\nchuckled. “There are some things that a computer can’t do as well as\r\na human being, and one of them is farm the foods on which humanity is\r\naccustomed to feed. A man’ll pay two credits for a steak. He could get a\r\nChlorella substitute for half a credit, but he’ll still buy the steak\r\nif he can afford it. Same thing goes for fruit, vegetables, grain, and\r\ngarden truck. Man’s eating habits have only changed from necessity.\r\nThose who can pay will still pay well for natural foods.” Blalok\r\nchuckled. “We’ve put quite a dent in the algae and synthetics operations\r\nin this sector.”\r\n\r\n“It’s still a luxury trade,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“You’ve eaten synthetic,” Blalok replied. “What do you prefer?”\r\n\r\nKennon had to agree that Blalok was right. He, too, liked the real thing\r\nfar better than its imitations.\r\n\r\n“If it’s this profitable, then why sell Lani?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“It’s the Family’s idea. Actually--since the export type is surplus it\r\ndoes us no harm. We keep enough for servants--and the others would be\r\ninefficient for most farm work. So disposal by sale is a logical and\r\nprofitable way of culling. But now the Boss-man is being pressured into\r\nbreeding an export type. And this I don’t like. It’s too commercial.\r\nSmells like slavery.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a Mystic, aren’t you?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Sure--but that doesn’t mean I like slavery. Oh, I know some of those\r\nfatheaded Brotherhood economists call our system economic slavery--and\r\nI’ll admit that it’s pretty hard to crack out of a spherical trust.\r\nBut that doesn’t mean that we have to stay where we are. Mystics aren’t\r\nowned by their entrepreneurs. Sure, it’s a tough haul to beat the\r\nboss, but it can be done. I did it, and others do it all the time. The\r\nsituation isn’t hopeless.”\r\n\r\n“But it is with the Lani,” Kennon added.\r\n\r\n“Of course. That’s why they should be protected. What chance does a\r\nLani have? Without us they can’t even keep going as a race. They’re\r\ntechnological morons. They don’t live long enough to understand modern\r\ncivilization. To turn those poor helpless humanoids out into human\r\nsociety would be criminal. It’s our duty to protect them even while\r\nwe’re using them.”\r\n\r\n“Man’s burden?’ Kennon said, repeating the old cliche.\r\n\r\n“Exactly.” Blalok scowled. “I wish I had guts enough to give the\r\nBoss-man the facts--but I can’t get nerve enough to try. I’ve a good job\r\nhere--a wife and two kids--and I don’t want to jeopardize my future.”\r\n Blalok glanced over the side. “Well, here we are,” he said, and began\r\ndescending into the center of a spokelike mass of buildings radiating\r\noutward from a central hub.\r\n\r\n“Hmm--big place,” Kennon murmured.\r\n\r\n“It should be,” Blalok replied. “It furnishes all of our Lani for\r\nreplacement and export. It can turn out over a thousand a year at\r\nfull capacity. Of course we don’t run at that rate, or Flora would be\r\noverpopulated. But this is a big layout, like you said. It can maintain\r\na population of at least forty thousand. Old Alexander had big ideas.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what he planned to do with them?” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t know. The Old Man never took anyone into his confidence.”\r\n\r\nJordan came up as the jeep settled to the ground. “Been expecting you\r\nfor the past half hour,” he said. “Your office said you were on your\r\nway.--Good to see you, too, Doc. I’ve been going over the records with\r\nHank Allworth--the stationmaster here.” Jordan held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“You’re an Earthman, eh?” Kennon asked as he grasped the outstretched\r\nhand. The gesture was as old as man, its ritualistic meaning lost in\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n“No--Marsborn--a neighbor world,” Jordan said. “But our customs and\r\nEarth’s are the same.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a long way from home,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“No farther than you, Doc.” Jordan looked uncomfortable. “But we can\r\ncompare origins later. Right now, you’d better come into the office.\r\nI’ve run across something peculiar.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n“There are twelve bays to this station,” Jordan said. “Under our present\r\nsetup two are used for breeding and the other ten for maturation. We\r\nrotate the youngsters around the bay--a different bay each year until\r\nthey’re age eleven. Then they’re sorted according to type and sent out\r\nfor a year of further specialized training after which they go onto the\r\nfarms, or to inhouse or export.\r\n\r\n“Now here’s the peculiar part. There’s no trouble in Bays One through\r\nNine, but Bay Ten has had all our losses except two that have occurred\r\nat the training stations.”\r\n\r\n“That’s good news,” Kennon said. “Our parasite can’t have had time to\r\nmigrate too far. We have him pinpointed unless--say how many training\r\ncenters are there?”\r\n\r\n“Three,” Jordan said.\r\n\r\n“Quarantine them,” Kennon replied. “Right now. Nothing goes in or out\r\nuntil we’ve checked them and completed prophylaxis.”\r\n\r\nJordan looked at Blalok inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“He’s the boss,” Blalok said. “Do as you’re told. This is his problem.”\r\n\r\n“Why the quarantine?” Jordan asked.\r\n\r\n“I want to get any carriers. We can check them with antigen, and then\r\ngive Trematox.”\r\n\r\n“All that concentration in Bay Ten,” Jordan said. “Does it mean\r\nsomething?”\r\n\r\n“Blalok said that there was a Santosian in your division.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah--Joe Kryla--and come to think of it, he ran Bay Ten!”\r\n\r\n“That’s a help--now let’s see what makes that bay different from the\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you--but you may not understand,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take a chance.”\r\n\r\nKennon grinned. “All right, you asked for it. The parasite that’s doing\r\nthe damage is a flatworm, a trematode called Hepatodirus hominis. As\r\nI’ve told Blalok, it’s a tricky thing. Like all trematodes it has a\r\nthree-stage life cycle, but unlike every other fluke, its life cycle is\r\nnot fixed to definite intermediate hosts. Depending upon where it is,\r\nthe fluke adapts. It still must pass through its life cycle, but its\r\nintermediate host need not be one species of snail, fish, or copepod.\r\nAny cold-blooded host will do. What you have here is a Kardonian variant\r\nwhich has adapted to some particular intermediate host on this world.\r\nUntil now, its final host was either man or Varl. Now we have a third,\r\nthe Lani. And apparently they are the most susceptible of the three.\r\nIt never kills Varl. And humans, while they’re more susceptible, only\r\noccasionally succumb, but the Lani appear to be the most susceptible of\r\nall. I’ve never seen an infestation like those Lani had. Their livers\r\nwere literally crawling with flukes.” Kennon paused and looked at\r\nJordan. “You following me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Slowly and poorly,” Jordan said. “You’re assuming too much knowledge on\r\nmy part.”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled. “You can’t say I didn’t warn you.”\r\n\r\n“Well--I’m really interested in only one thing--how do you break the\r\nparasite up in business?”\r\n\r\n“There’s only one sure way--and that’s to break the life cycle. The\r\ntechnique is thousands of years old, but it’s just as good today as it\r\nwas then.”\r\n\r\n“Good--then let’s do it.”\r\n\r\n“To make a varrit stew,” Kennon said, “one must first catch the varrit.”\r\n\r\n“Huh?”\r\n\r\n“We have to learn the beastie’s life cycle before we can break it,\r\nand like I said, it adapts. Its intermediate host can be any one of a\r\nhundred cold-blooded animals.”\r\n\r\n“Is there no place else where it can be attacked?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, in the body of the final host, or on its final encysting place.\r\nBut that won’t eliminate the bug.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“It’ll still survive in its infective form and enough Lani will get\r\nsubacute dosage to propagate it until the time is right for another\r\nepizootic. We have to kill its intermediate host--or hosts if it has\r\nmore than one. That will keep it from growing and will ultimately\r\neradicate it.”\r\n\r\nJudson scratched his head. “It sounds complicated.”\r\n\r\n“It is. It’s so complicated that once the fluke becomes well established\r\nit’s virtually impossible to eradicate.”\r\n\r\n“And you think it can be done here?”\r\n\r\n“We can give it the old college try. But it’s going to take some\r\ndetective work.”\r\n\r\n“Where do we start?”\r\n\r\n“With Bay Ten. We look it over real well. Then we check the diet and\r\nhabits of the Lani. Then we check each individual Lani. Then we check\r\nthe life cycle of the parasite. Somewhere along the line if we’re lucky\r\nwe’ll find a weak point that can be attacked.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a big order,” Blalok said.\r\n\r\n“It can’t be helped. That’s the way it is. Of course, we’re lucky that\r\nwe’re on an isolated land mass. That gives us an advantage. We should be\r\nable to clean this up.”\r\n\r\n“How long do you think it will take?”\r\n\r\n“It depends on how well the fluke is established. Six months at the\r\nminimum--and I wouldn’t care to guess at the maximum. However, I hope\r\nthe minimum will be time enough.”\r\n\r\n“So do I,” Blalok said.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Kennon said, “let’s get on with it.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it won’t interrupt our program,” Jordan said.\r\n\r\n“Of course it will interrupt it,” Kennon replied. “It can’t help it. Get\r\nthe idea in your head that you’re facing something here that can cripple\r\nyou--maybe abort your whole operation. You have a choice--interrupt now\r\nor abort later. And half measures won’t work. To eradicate this pest\r\nrequires an all-out effort.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t see why we can’t merely bypass Bay Ten--” Jordan said.\r\n\r\n“Take my word for it,” Kennon said. “You can’t. There’s no accurate way\r\nof telling how far this spreads until the death losses occur. Our tests\r\nfor fluke infestation aren’t that good. We have to work thoroughly and\r\ncarefully. We can’t be butting heads over this--either we all co-operate\r\nor this whole operation will blow up in our faces.\r\n\r\n“Look at the record. Six months ago you ended a year with no deaths from\r\ndisease. Five months ago Old Doc and two Lani were ill. Four months ago\r\none of the two Lani was dead and Old Doc was too ill to be effective.\r\nThree months ago Old Doc and the other Lani were dead, and before the\r\nend of the month two more followed them. Two months ago six died, last\r\nmonth eight, and so far this month you’ve lost four and you have over\r\ntwo weeks to go. Up to now they’ve all been from here, but two this\r\nmonth were at other stations. In six months if nothing is done, we’ll\r\nbe having losses there unless we’re lucky. And the losses will keep\r\non increasing. Apparently you don’t know what it is to live with\r\nparasites--so let me tell you. It isn’t pleasant!”\r\n\r\nBlalok shrugged. “You needn’t get hot about it,” he said. “After all,\r\nyou’re the Doc--and we’ll co-operate.”\r\n\r\nJordan nodded. “We will,” he said. “All the way.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThere is a special providence that looks over recent veterinary\r\ngraduates, Kennon reflected as he checked the monthly reports from the\r\nStations. Since the time he had laid down the law to Judson and Blalok,\r\nhe had had no trouble from the production staff. And for the past four\r\nmonths there had been no further trouble with Hepatodirus. That unwanted\r\nvisitor had apparently been evicted. At that, they had been lucky. The\r\nparasite had been concentrated at Hillside Station and had failed to\r\nestablish itself in the training area. The intermediate host, it had\r\nturned out, was a small amphibian that was susceptible to commercial\r\ninsecticide. It had been no trouble to eradicate. Systemic treatment and\r\ncooking of all food had cleaned up the infective cercaria and individual\r\ninfections, and after six months of intensive search, quarantine, and\r\ninvestigation, Kennon was morally certain that the disease had been\r\neradicated. The last four reports confirmed his belief.\r\n\r\nHe sighed as he leaned back in his chair. Blalok was at last convinced\r\nthat his ideas were right. The hospital was operating as a hospital\r\nshould, with a staff of twelve Lani kept busy checking the full wards.\r\nActually, it was working better than it should, since stationmasters all\r\nover the island were now shipping in sick animals rather than treating\r\nthem or requesting outpatient service.\r\n\r\n“Hi, Doc,” Blalok said as he pushed the door open and looked into the\r\noffice. “You doing anything?”\r\n\r\n“Not at the moment,” Kennon said. “Something troubling you?”\r\n\r\n“No--just thought I’d drop in for a moment and congratulate you.”\r\n\r\n“For what?”\r\n\r\n“For surviving the first year.”\r\n\r\n“That won’t be for two months yet.”\r\n\r\nBlalok shook his head. “This is Kardon,” he said. “There’s only three\r\nhundred and two days in our year, ten thirty-day months and two special\r\ndays at the year’s end.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. “My contract is Galactic Standard. I still have two\r\nmonths to go. But how come the ten-month year? Most other planets have\r\ntwelve, regardless of the number of days.”\r\n\r\n“Old Alexander liked thirty-day months.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve wondered about that.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll find a lot more peculiar things about Flora when you get to know\r\nher better. This year has just been a breaking-in period.”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled. “It’s damn near broken me,” he admitted. “You know, I\r\nthought that the Lani’d be my principal practice when I came here.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t figure that right. They’re the easiest part. They’re\r\nintelligent and co-operative.”\r\n\r\n“Which is more than one can say about the others.” Kennon wiped the\r\nsweat from his face. “What with this infernal heat and their eternal\r\nstubbornness, I’ve nearly been driven crazy.”\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t have laid out that vaccination program.”\r\n\r\n“I had to. Your hog business was living mostly on luck, and the sheep\r\nand shrakes were almost as bad. You can’t get away from soil saprophytes\r\nno matter how clean you are. Under a pasture setup there’s always\r\na chance of contamination. And that old cliche about an ounce of\r\nprevention is truer of livestock raising than anything else I can think\r\nof.”\r\n\r\n“I have some more good news for you,” Blalok said. “That’s why I came\r\nover. We’re going to have another species to treat and vaccinate.”\r\n\r\nKennon groaned. “Now what?”\r\n\r\n“Poultry.” Blalok’s voice was disgusted. “Personally I think it’s a\r\nmess, but Alexander thinks it’s profitable. Someone’s told him that\r\npound for pound chickens are the most efficient feed converters of all\r\nthe domestic animals. So we’re getting a pilot plant: eggs, incubator,\r\nand a knocked-down broiler battery so we can try the idea out.\r\nThe Boss-man is always hot on new ideas to increase efficiency and\r\nproduction. The only trouble is that he fails to consider the work\r\ninvolved in setting up another operation.”\r\n\r\n“You’re so right. I’ll have to brush up on pullorum, ornithosis,\r\ncoccidosis, leukosis, perosis, and Ochsner knows how many other-osises\r\nand--itises. I was never too strong on fowl practice in school, and I’d\r\nbe happier if I never had anything to do with them.”\r\n\r\n“So would I,” Blalok agreed. “I can’t see anything in this but trouble.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded.\r\n\r\n“And he’s forgotten something else,” Blalok added. “Poultry need\r\nconcentrated feed. We’re going to have to install a feed mill.”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled. “I hope he’ll appreciate the bill he gets.”\r\n\r\n“He thinks we can use local labor,” Blalok said gloomily. “I wish he’d\r\nrealize that Lani are technological morons.”\r\n\r\n“They could learn.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so--but it isn’t easy. And besides, Allworth is the only man\r\nwith feed-mill experience, and he’s up to his ears with Hillside Station\r\nsince that expansion order came in.”\r\n\r\n“I never did get the reason for that. After we complained about the\r\nslavery implications and got the Boss-man’s okay to hold the line, why\r\ndo we need more Lani?”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you know? His sister’s finally decided to try marriage. Found\r\nherself some overmuscled Halsite who looked good to her--but she\r\ncouldn’t crack his moral barrier.” Blalok grinned. “I thought you’d be\r\nthe first to know. Wasn’t she interested in you?”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled. “You could call it that. Interested--like the way a\r\ndog’s interested in a beefsteak. It’s a good thing we had that fluke\r\nproblem or I’d have been chewed up and digested long ago. That woman\r\nfrightens me.”\r\n\r\n“I could be scared by uglier things,” Blalok said. “With the Boss-man’s\r\nsister on my side I wouldn’t worry.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think she’d be on my side? She’s a cannibal.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know her better than I do.”\r\n\r\nHe did--he certainly did. That first month had been one of the worst he\r\nhad ever spent, Kennon reflected. Between Eloise and the flukes, he had\r\nnearly collapsed--and when it had come to the final showdown, he thought\r\nfor a while that he’d be looking for another job. But Alexander had been\r\nmore than passably understanding and had refused his sister’s passionate\r\npleas for a Betan scalp. He owed a debt of gratitude to the Boss-man.\r\n\r\n“You’re lucky you never knew her,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“That all depends on what you mean,” Blalok said as he grinned and\r\nwalked to the door. The parting shot missed its mark entirely as Kennon\r\nlooked at him with blank incomprehension. “You should have been a\r\nMystic,” Blalok said. “A knowledge of the sacred books would do you no\r\nend of good.” And with that cryptic remark the superintendent vanished.\r\n\r\n“That had all the elements of a snide remark,” Kennon murmured to\r\nhimself, “but my education’s been neglected somewhere along the line. I\r\ndon’t get it.” He shrugged and buzzed for Copper. The veterinary report\r\nwould have to be added to the pile already before him, and the Boss-man\r\nliked to have his reports on time.\r\n\r\nCopper watched Kennon as he dictated the covering letter, her slim\r\nfingers dancing over the stenotype. He had been here a full year--but\r\ninstead of becoming a familiar object, he had grown so gigantic that\r\nhe filled her world. And it wasn’t merely because he was young and\r\nbeautiful. He was kind, too.\r\n\r\nYet she couldn’t approach him, and she wanted to so desperately that\r\nit was a physical pain. Other Lani had told her about men and what they\r\ncould do. Even her old preceptress at Hillside Station had given her\r\nsome advice when Man Allworth had tattooed the tiny V on her thigh that\r\nmeant she had been selected for the veterinary staff. And when Old Doc\r\nhad brought her from the Training Station to the hospital and removed\r\nher tail, she was certain that she was one of the lucky ones who would\r\nknow love.\r\n\r\nBut love wasn’t a pain in the chest, an ache in the belly and thighs, an\r\nunfulfilled longing that destroyed sleep and made food tasteless. Love\r\nwas supposed to be pleasant and exciting. She could remember every word\r\nher preceptress had spoken.\r\n\r\n“My little one,” the old Lani had said, “you now wear the doctor’s mark.\r\nAnd soon no one will be able to tell you from a human. You will look\r\nlike our masters. You will share in their work. And there may be times\r\nwhen you will find favor in their eyes. Then you may learn of love.\r\n\r\n“Love,” the old voice was soft in Copper’s ears. “The word is almost a\r\nstranger to us now, known only to the few who serve our masters. It was\r\nnot always so. The Old Ones knew love before Man Alexander came. And\r\nour young were the fruit of love rather than the product of our masters’\r\ncunning. But you may know the flower even though you cannot bear its\r\nfruit. You may enter that world of pleasure-pain the Old Ones knew, that\r\nworld which is now denied us.\r\n\r\n“But remember always that you are a Lani. A man may be kind to you. He\r\nmay treat you gently. He may show you love. Yet you never will be his\r\nequal. Nor must you become too attached to him, for you are not human.\r\nYou are not his natural mate. You cannot bear his young. You cannot\r\ncompletely share. You can only accept.\r\n\r\n“So if love should come to you, take it and enjoy it, but do not try to\r\npossess it. For there lies heartache rather than happiness. And it is\r\na world of heartache, my little one, to long for something which you\r\ncannot have.”\r\n\r\nTo long for something which one cannot have! Copper knew that feeling.\r\nIt had been with her ever since Kennon had come into her life that\r\nnight a year ago. And it had grown until it had become gigantic. He\r\nwas kind--yes. He was harsh--occasionally. Yet he had shown her no more\r\naffection than he would have shown a dog. Less--for he would have petted\r\na dog and he did not touch her.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, but she was not a part of his laughter. He needed her, but\r\nthe need was that of a builder for a tool. He liked her and sometimes\r\nshared his problems and triumphs with her, and sometimes his defeats,\r\nbut he did not love. There had never been for her the bright fierce look\r\nhe had bent upon the Woman Eloise those times when she had come to him,\r\nthe look men gave to those who found favor in their eyes.\r\n\r\nHad he looked at her but once with that expression she would have come\r\nto him though fire barred the way. The Woman Eloise was a fool.\r\n\r\nCopper looked at him across the corner of the desk, the yellow hair, the\r\nbronze skin, firm chin, soft lips and long straight nose, the\r\nnarrowed eyes, hooded beneath thick brows, scanning the papers in his\r\nlean-tendoned hands. His nearness was an ache in her body--yet he was\r\nfar away.\r\n\r\nShe thought of how his hands would feel upon her. He had touched her\r\nonce, and that touch had burned like hot iron. For hours she had felt\r\nit. He looked up. Her heart choked her with its beating. She would die\r\nfor him if he would but once run his fingers over her tingling skin, and\r\nstroke her hair.\r\n\r\nThe naked emotion in Copper’s face was readable enough, Kennon thought.\r\nOne didn’t need Sorovkin techniques to interpret what was in her mind.\r\nAnd it would have been amusing if it weren’t so sad. For what she\r\nwanted, he couldn’t give. Yet if she were human it would be easy. A\r\nhundred generations of Betan moral code said “never,” yet when he looked\r\nat her their voices faded. He was a man--a member of the ruling race.\r\nShe was an animal--a beast--a humanoid--near human but not near enough.\r\nTo like her was easy--but to love her was impossible. It would be\r\nbestiality. Yet his body, less discerning than his mind, responded to\r\nher nearness.\r\n\r\nHe sighed. It was a pleasant unpleasantness, a mixed emotion he could\r\nnot analyze. In a way it was poetry--the fierce, vaguely disquieting\r\npoetry of the sensual Santosian bards--the lyrics that sung of the joys\r\nof flesh. He had never really liked them, yet they filled him with a\r\nvague longing, an odd uneasiness--just the sort that filled him now.\r\nThere was a deadly parallel here. He sighed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir? Do you want something?” Copper asked.\r\n\r\n“I could use a cup of coffee,” he said. “These reports are getting me\r\ndown.” The banality amused him--sitting here thinking of Copper and\r\ntalking about coffee. Banality was at once the curse and the saving\r\ngrace of mankind. It kept men from the emotional peaks and valleys that\r\ncould destroy them. He chuckled shakily. The only alternative would be\r\nto get rid of her--and he couldn’t (or wouldn’t?--the question intruded\r\nslyly) do that.\r\n\r\nCopper returned with a steaming cup which she set before him. Truly,\r\nthis coffee was a man’s drink. She had tried it once but the hot\r\nbitterness scalded her mouth and flooded her body with its heat. And she\r\nhad felt so lightheaded. Not like herself at all. It wasn’t a drink for\r\nLani. Of that she was certain.\r\n\r\nYet he enjoyed it. He looked at her and smiled. He was pleased with\r\nher. Perhaps--yet--she might find favor in his eyes. The hope was always\r\nthere within her--a hope that was at once fear and prayer. And if she\r\ndid--she would know what to do.\r\n\r\nKennon looked up. Copper’s face was convulsed with a bright mixture of\r\nhope and pain. Never, he swore, had he saw anything more beautiful or\r\nsad. Involuntarily he placed his hand upon her arm. She flinched, her\r\nmuscles tensing under his finger tips. It was though his fingers carried\r\na galvanic current that backlashed up his arm even as it stiffened hers.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Copper?” he asked softly.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Doctor. I’m just upset.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\nThere it was again, the calm friendly curiosity that was worse than a\r\nbath in ice water. Her heart sank. She shivered. She would never find\r\nher desire here. He was cold--cold--cold! He wouldn’t see. He didn’t\r\ncare. All right--so that was how it had to be. But first she would tell\r\nhim. Then he could do with her as he wished. “I hoped--for the past year\r\nthat you would see me. That you would think of me not as a Lani, but as\r\na beloved.” The words came faster now, tumbling over one another. “That\r\nyou would desire me and take me to those worlds we cannot know unless\r\nyou humans show us. I have hoped so much, but I suppose it’s wrong--for\r\nyou--you are so very human, and I--well, I’m not!” The last three words\r\nheld all the sadness and the longing of mankind aspiring to be God.\r\n\r\n“My dear--my poor child,” Kennon murmured.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, but her eyes could not focus on his face, for his\r\nhands were on her shoulders and the nearness of him drove the breath\r\nfrom her body. From a distance she heard a hard tight voice that was her\r\nown. “Oh, sir--oh please, sir!”\r\n\r\nThe hands withdrew, leaving emptiness--but her heartbeat slowed and the\r\npink haze cleared and she could see his face.\r\n\r\nAnd with a surge of terror and triumph she realized what she saw! That\r\nhard bright look that encompassed and possessed her! The curved lips\r\ndrawn over white, white teeth! The flared nostrils! The hungry demand\r\nupon his face that answered the demand in her heart! And she knew--at\r\nlast--with a knowledge that turned her limbs to water, that she had\r\nfound favor in his eyes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMixed emotion! Ha! The author of that cliche didn’t even know its\r\nmeaning! Kennon strode furiously down the dusty road toward Station One\r\ntrying to sublimate his inner conflict into action. It was useless, of\r\ncourse, for once he stopped moving the grim tug-of-war between training\r\nand desire would begin again, and no matter how it ended the result\r\nwould be unsatisfactory. As long as he had been able to delude himself\r\nthat he was fond of Copper the way a man is fond of some lesser species,\r\nit had been all right. But he knew now that he was fond of her as a man\r\nis of a woman--and it was hell! For no rationalization in the universe\r\nwould allow him to define her as human. Copper was humanoid--something\r\nlike human. And to live with her and love her would not be\r\nmiscegenation, which was bad enough, but bestiality which was a thousand\r\ntimes worse.\r\n\r\nAlthough throughout most of the Brotherhood miscegenation was an unknown\r\nword, and even bestiality had become a loose definition on many worlds\r\nwith humanoid populations, the words had definite meaning and moral\r\nforce to a Betan. And--God help him--he was a Betan. A lifetime of\r\ntraining in a moral code that frowned upon mixed marriages and shrank\r\nappalled from even the thought of mixing species was nothing to bring\r\nface to face with the fact that he loved Copper.\r\n\r\nIt was odd, Kennon reflected bitterly, that humans could do with animals\r\nwhat their customs and codes prohibited them from doing to themselves.\r\nFor thousands of years--back to the very dawn of history when men had\r\nbred horses and asses to produce mules--men had been mixing species\r\nto produce useful hybrids. Yet a Betan who could hybridize plants or\r\nanimals with complete equanimity shrank with horror from the thought of\r\napplying the same technique to himself.\r\n\r\nWhat was there about a human being that was so sacrosanct? He shook his\r\nhead angrily. He didn’t know. There was no answer. But the idea--the\r\nbelief--was there, ingrained into his attitudes, a part of his outlook,\r\nbuilt carefully block by block from infancy until it now towered into a\r\nmighty wall that barred him from doing what he wished to do.\r\n\r\nIt would be an easier hurdle if he had been born anywhere except on\r\nBeta. In the rest of the Brotherhood, the color of a man’s skin, the\r\nshape of his face, the quality and color of his hair and eyes made no\r\ndifference. All men were brothers. But on Beta, where a variant-G sun\r\nhad already caused genetic divergence, the brotherhood of man was a term\r\nthat was merely given lip service. Betans were different and from birth\r\nthey were taught to accept the difference and to live with it. Mixing of\r\nBetan stock with other human species, while not actually forbidden, was\r\nso encircled with conditioning that it was a rare Betan indeed who would\r\nrisk self-opprobrium and the contempt of his fellows to mate with an\r\noutsider. And as for humanoids--Kennon shuddered. He couldn’t break the\r\nattitudes of a lifetime. Yet he loved Copper.\r\n\r\nAnd she knew he did!\r\n\r\nAnd that was an even greater horror. He had fled from the office, from\r\nthe glad light in her eyes, as a burned child flees fire. He needed time\r\nto think, time to plan. Yet his body and his surface thoughts wanted no\r\nplans or time. Living with a Lani wasn’t frowned upon on Flora. Many of\r\nthe staff did, nor did anyone seem to think less of them for doing\r\nso. Even Alexander himself had half-confessed to a more than platonic\r\naffection for a Lani called Susy.\r\n\r\nYet this was no excuse, nor would it silence the cold still voice in his\r\nmind that kept repeating sodomite--sodomite--sodomite with a passionless\r\ninflection that was even more terrible than anger.\r\n\r\nThe five kilometers to Station One disappeared unnoticed beneath his\r\nfeet as he walked, and he looked up in surprise to see the white walls\r\nand red roofs of the station looming before him.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! Doc! What’s got into you?” the stationmaster said. “You\r\nlook like you’d seen a ghost. And out in this sun without a helmet! Come\r\ninside, man, before you get sunstroke!”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled without humor. “Getting sunstroke is the least of my\r\nworries, Al,” he said, but he allowed Al Crothers to usher him inside.\r\n\r\n“It’s odd that you showed up right now,” Al said, his dark face showing\r\nthe curiosity that filled him. “I just had a call from Message Center\r\nnot five minutes ago, telling me to have you call in if you showed up.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKennon sighed. “On this island you can’t get away from the phone,” he\r\nsaid wryly. “O.K., where is it?”\r\n\r\n“You look pretty bushed, Doc. Maybe you’d better rest awhile.”\r\n\r\n“And maybe it’s an emergency,” Kennon interrupted. “And probably it is\r\nbecause the staff can handle routine matters--so maybe you’d better show\r\nme where you keep the phone.”\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“One moment please,” the Message Center operator said. There were a few\r\nclicks in the background. “Here’s your party,” she continued. “Go ahead,\r\nDoctor.”\r\n\r\n“Kennon?” a nervous voice crackled from the receiver.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“You’re needed out on Otpen One.”\r\n\r\n“Who is calling--and what’s the rush?”\r\n\r\n“Douglas--Douglas Alexander. The Lani are dying! It’s an emergency!\r\nCousin Alex’ll skin us alive if we let these Lani die!”\r\n\r\nDouglas! Kennon hadn’t thought of him since the one time they had met\r\nin Alexandria. That was a year ago. It seemed much longer. Since the\r\nBoss-man had exiled his cousin to that bleak rock to the east of Flora\r\nthere had been no word of him. And now--he laughed a sharp bark of\r\nhumorless annoyance--Douglas couldn’t have timed it better if he had\r\ntried!\r\n\r\n“All right,” Kennon said. “I’ll come. What seems to be the trouble?”\r\n\r\n“They’re sick.”\r\n\r\n“That’s obvious,” Kennon snapped. “Otherwise you wouldn’t be calling.\r\nCan’t you tell me any more than that?”\r\n\r\n“They’re vomiting. They have diarrhea. Several have had fits.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” Kennon said. “I’ll be right out. Expect me in an hour.”\r\n\r\n“So you’re leaving?” Al asked as he cradled the phone.\r\n\r\n“That’s a practitioner’s life,” Kennon said. “Full of interruptions. Can\r\nI borrow your jeep?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll drive you. Where do you want to go?”\r\n\r\n“To the hospital,” Kennon said. “I’ll have to pick up my gear. It’s an\r\nemergency all right.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a tough one,” Al said admiringly. “I’d hate to walk five kilos\r\nin this heat without a hat--and then go out on a call.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. “It’s not necessarily toughness. I believe in doing one\r\njob at a time--and my contract reads veterinary service, not personal\r\nproblems. The job comes first and there’s work to do.”\r\n\r\nCopper wasn’t in sight when Kennon came back to the hospital--a fact for\r\nwhich he was grateful. He packed quickly, threw his bags into the jeep,\r\nand took off with almost guilty haste. He’d contact the Hospital from\r\nthe Otpens. Right now all he wanted was to put distance between himself\r\nand Copper. Absence might make the heart grow fonder, but at the moment\r\npropinquity was by far the more dangerous thing. He pointed the blunt\r\nnose of the jeep toward Mount Olympus, set the autopilot, opened the\r\nthrottle, and relaxed as best he could as the little vehicle sped at top\r\nspeed for the outer islands. A vague curiosity filled him. He’d never\r\nbeen on the Otpens. He wondered what they were like.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOtpen One was a rocky tree-clad islet crowned with the stellate mass of\r\na Class II Fortalice. But this one wasn’t like Alexandria. It was fully\r\nmanned and in service condition.\r\n\r\n“Airboat!” a voice crackled from the dashboard speaker of the jeep,\r\n“Identify yourself! You are being tracked.”\r\n\r\nKennon quickly flipped the IFF switch. “Dr. Kennon, from Flora,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir. You are expected and are clear to land. Bring your\r\nvehicle down in the marked area.” A section of the roof turned a garish\r\nyellow as Kennon circled the building. He brought the jeep in lightly,\r\nsetting it carefully in the center of the area.\r\n\r\n“Leave your vehicle,” the speaker chattered. “If you are armed leave\r\nyour weapon behind.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not my habit to carry a gun,” Kennon snapped.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, sir--regulations,” the speaker said. ‘“This is S.O.P.”\r\n\r\nKennon left the jeep and instantly felt the probing tingle of a search\r\nbeam. He looked around curiously at the flat roof of the fortress\r\nwith its domed turrets and ugly snouts of the main battery projectors\r\npointing skyward. Beside him, the long metal doors of a missile launcher\r\nmade a rectangular trace on the smooth surface of the roof. Behind him\r\nthe central tower poked its gaunt ferromorph and durilium outline into\r\nthe darkening sky bearing its crown of spiderweb radar antennae turning\r\nsteadily on their gimbals covering a vast hemisphere from horizon to\r\nzenith with endless inspection.\r\n\r\nFrom the base of the tower a man emerged. He was tall, taller even than\r\nKennon, and the muscles of his body showed through the tightness of\r\nhis battle dress. His face was harsh, and in his hands he carried a\r\nBurkholtz magnum--the most powerful portable weapon mankind had yet\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\n“You are Dr. Kennon?” the trooper asked.\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“Your I.D., please.”\r\n\r\nKennon handed it over and the big man scanned the card with practiced\r\neyes. “Check,” he said. “Follow me, sir.”\r\n\r\n“My bags,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“They’ll be taken care of.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged and followed the man into the tower. A modern grav-shaft\r\nlowered them to the ground floor. They passed through a gloomy\r\ncaricature of the Great Hall in Alexandria, through an iris, and down a\r\nlong corridor lined with doors.\r\n\r\nA bell rang.\r\n\r\n“Back!” the trooper said. “Against the wall! Quick! Into the doorway!”\r\n\r\n“What’s up?”\r\n\r\n“Another practice alert.” The trooper’s voice was bored. “It gets so\r\nthat you’d almost wish for a fight to relieve the monotony.”\r\n\r\nA trooper and several Lani came down the corridor, running in\r\ndisciplined formation. Steel clanged on steel as they turned the corner\r\nand moments later the whine of servos came faintly to their ears. From\r\nsomewhere deep in the pile a rising crescendo of generators under full\r\nbattle load sent out vibrations that could be sensed rather than heard.\r\nA klaxon squawked briefly. There was another clash of metal, and a harsh\r\nvoice boomed through the corridors. “Fourteen seconds. Well done. Secure\r\nstations!”\r\n\r\nThe trooper grinned. “That ties the record,” he said. “We can go now.”\r\n\r\nThe corridor ended abruptly at an iris flanked by two sentries. They\r\nconferred briefly with Kennon’s guide, dilated the iris, and motioned\r\nfor Kennon to enter. The pastel interior of the modern office was a\r\nshocking contrast to the gray ferromorph corridors outside.\r\n\r\nDouglas Alexander was standing behind the desk. He was much the same.\r\nHis pudgy face was haggard with uncertainty and his eyes darted back\r\nand forth as his fingers caressed the knobby grip of a small Burkholtz\r\njutting from a holster at his waist. There were new, unpleasant furrows\r\nbetween his eyes. He looked older and the indefinable air of cruelty was\r\nmore pronounced. He had been frightened the last time Kennon had seen\r\nhim, and he was frightened now.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure whether I am glad to see you, Kennon,” he said\r\nuncertainly. “But I suppose I have to be.”\r\n\r\nKennon believed him.\r\n\r\n“How have you been?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Not too bad until this afternoon. Things have been going pretty well.”\r\n He shifted uncomfortably from one foot to another. “I suppose Cousin\r\nAlex will skin me for this, but there’s nothing else I can do.” He\r\nlicked his lips. “You’ve been here long enough--and you’ll have to know\r\neventually.” He fidgeted and finally sat down behind the desk. “We\r\nhave trouble. Half the Lani were stricken about four hours ago. It was\r\nsudden. No warning at all. And if they die--” his voice trailed off.\r\n\r\n“Well--what are we waiting for? Get someone to bring my bags down here\r\nand we’ll look them over.”\r\n\r\n“Do you have to?--Can’t you prescribe something?”\r\n\r\n“How? I haven’t examined the patients.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you what’s wrong.”\r\n\r\nKennon smiled. “I hardly think that’s the way to do it. Even though\r\nyour description might be accurate, you still might miss something of\r\ncritical importance.”\r\n\r\nDouglas sighed. “I thought that’s what you’d say,” he said. “Oh--very\r\nwell--you might as well see what we have out here.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t possibly believe that I don’t already know,” Kennon said.\r\n“You have male Lani.”\r\n\r\nDouglas looked at him, his face blank with surprise. “But--how did you\r\nknow? No one on the main island does except the Family. And we never\r\ntalk about it. Did Eloise tell you? I noticed she was struck with you\r\nthe day you came, and the Lani who have come out here since have been\r\ntalking about you two. Did she do it?”\r\n\r\nKennon shook his head. “She never said a word.”\r\n\r\n“Then how--”\r\n\r\n“I’m not stupid,” Kennon said. “That story you’ve spread about\r\nartificial fertilization has more holes in it than a sieve. That\r\ntechnique has been investigated a thousand times. And it has never\r\nworked past the first generation. If you had been using it, the Lani\r\nwould long ago have been extinct. Haploids don’t reproduce, and the only\r\nway the diploid number of chromosomes can be kept is to replace those\r\nlost by maturation division of the ovum. You might be able to keep the\r\ndiploid number by using immature ova, but the fertilization technique\r\nwould be far more complex than the simple uterine injections you use at\r\nHillside Station.”\r\n\r\nDouglas looked at him blankly.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” Kennon added, “I have a microscope. I checked your so-called\r\nfertilizing solution. I found spermatozoa, and spermatozoa only come\r\nfrom males. What’s more, the males have to be the same species as the\r\nfemales or fertilization will not take place. So there must be male\r\nLani. Nothing else fits. You’ve been using artificial insemination\r\non the main-island Lani. And from the way this place is guarded, it’s\r\nobvious that here is your stud farm.”\r\n\r\nDouglas shrugged and spread his hands in a gesture of resignation. “I\r\nsuppose,” he said, “that’s the way Old Doc found out too. We never told\r\nhim, but he knew before he ever came out here.”\r\n\r\n“The only thing that puzzles me,” Kennon went on, “is how you managed to\r\neliminate the Y-chromosome carriers within the sperm.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“The male sex-determinant. Half the sperm carry it, but so far as I\r\nknow, there’s never been a male born on the main island.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--that. It’s something that’s done in the labs here. Probably one of\r\nthe technicians could tell you. It’s called electro--electro freezing\r\nor something like that.”\r\n\r\n“Electrodiaphoresis?”\r\n\r\nDouglas nodded. “That sounds like it. I don’t know anything about\r\nit. One of Grandfather’s men did the basic work. We just follow\r\ninstructions.” He shrugged. “Well--since you know the secret there’s no\r\nsense in hiding the bodies. Come along and tell me what’s wrong.”\r\n\r\nIt was a peculiar feeling to walk down the row of cubical rooms with\r\ntheir barred doors. The whole area reminded him of a historical novel,\r\nof the prisons of early human history where men confined other men for\r\ninfractions of social customs. The grimness of the place was appalling.\r\nThe male Lani--impressive in their physical development--were in\r\nmiserable condition, nauseated, green-faced, retching. The sickening\r\nodors of vomit and diarrhea hung heavily on the air. Douglas coughed and\r\nheld a square of cloth to his face, and even Kennon, strong-stomached\r\nas he was, could feel his viscera twitch in sympathy with the caged\r\nsufferers.\r\n\r\n“Great Fleming, man!” Kennon exploded. “You can’t keep them here. Get\r\nthem out! Give them some fresh air! This place would make a well man\r\nsick.”\r\n\r\nDouglas looked at him, “I wouldn’t take one of them out unless I had him\r\nshackled and there was an armed guard to help me. Those males are the\r\nmost vicious, cunning, and dangerous animals on Kardon. They exist with\r\nbut one thought in mind--to kill!”\r\n\r\nKennon looked curiously through a barred door at one of the Lani. He lay\r\non a bare cot, a magnificently muscled figure with a ragged black beard\r\nhiding his face. There were dozens of scars on his body and one angry\r\npurple area on his thick right forearm where flesh had been torn away\r\nnot too long ago. Beads of sweat stood out on his forehead and soft\r\nmoaning noises came from his tight lips as he pressed his abdomen with\r\nthick-fingered hands. “He doesn’t look so dangerous,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“Watch it!” Douglas warned. “Don’t get too close!” But the warning was\r\ntoo late. Kennon touched the bars, and as he did, the Lani moved with\r\nfluid speed, one huge hand clutching Kennon’s sleeve and pulling him\r\nagainst the bars while the other darted for his throat. Fingers bit\r\ninto Kennon’s neck and tightened in a viselike grip. Kennon reacted\r\nautomatically. His arms came up inside the Lani’s and crashed down,\r\nelbows out, tearing the Lani loose. He jumped back, rubbing his bruised\r\nthroat. “That fellow’s not sick!” he gasped. “He’s crazy!”\r\n\r\nThe Lani glared at him through the bars, disappointment written on his\r\nscarred and bearded face.\r\n\r\n“I warned you,” Douglas said. His voice held an undertone of malicious\r\nlaughter. “He must be sick or he would have killed you. George is clever\r\nin a stupid sort of way.”\r\n\r\nKennon looked into the cubicle. The Lani glared back and growled. There\r\nwas a beastlike note in his voice that made the short hairs on Kennon’s\r\nneck prickle.\r\n\r\n“That fellow needs a lesson,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You want to give it to him?” Douglas asked.\r\n\r\n“Not particularly.”\r\n\r\n“Ha!--man!--you afraid!” the Lani taunted. His voice was thick and\r\nharsh. “All men fear me. All Lani, too. I am boss. Come close again man\r\nand I kill you!”\r\n\r\n“Are they all that stupid?” Kennon asked. “He sounds like a homicidal\r\nmoron.”\r\n\r\n“He’s not stupid,” Douglas said. “Just uneducated.”\r\n\r\n“Why is he so murderous?”\r\n\r\n“That’s his training. All his life he has fought. From childhood his\r\nlife has been based on his ability to survive in an environment where\r\nevery male is his enemy. You see here the sublimation of individuality.\r\nHe cannot co-operate with another male. He hates them, and they in turn\r\nhate him. George, here, is a perfect example of absolute freedom from\r\nrestraint.” Douglas smiled unpleasantly.\r\n\r\n“His whole history is one of complete lack of control. As an infant,\r\nbeing a male, his mother thought she was favored by the gods and she\r\ndenied him nothing. In fact we were quite insistent that she gave him\r\neverything he wanted. By the time he was able to walk and take care of\r\nhimself, he was completely spoiled, selfish, and authoritative.\r\n\r\n“Then we took him and a dozen others exactly like him and put them\r\ntogether.” Douglas grinned. “You should see what happens when a dozen\r\nspoiled brats are forced to live together. It’s more fun. The little\r\nbeasts hate each other on sight. And we stimulate them to compete for\r\ntoys, food, and drink. Never quite enough to go around. You can imagine\r\nwhat happens. Instead of sharing, each little selfish individualist\r\nfights to get everything he can grab. Except for one thing we\r\ndon’t punish them no matter what they do. If anyone shows signs of\r\nco-operating he is disciplined severely, the first time. The next time,\r\nhe is culled. But other than that, we leave them alone. They develop\r\ntheir personalities and their muscles--and if one proves to be too\r\nmuch for his fellows we transfer him to a more advanced class where the\r\ncompetition is keener, and he learns what it is to lose.\r\n\r\n“At puberty we add sex drive to the basics, and by the time our male\r\nreaches maturity we have something like George. Actually, George is\r\nmore mature than either you or I. He has all the answers he needs. He’s\r\nstrong, solitary, authoritative, and selfish. He has no curiosity and\r\nresents encroachment. He’s a complete individualist. If he proves out he\r\nshould make an excellent sire.”\r\n\r\n“But isn’t he dangerous to handle?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but we take precautions.”\r\n\r\nKennon grimaced with distaste.\r\n\r\n“Look at it objectively,” Douglas said. “We’re trying to select the best\r\nphysical type we can in the hope that he’ll pass his qualities to his\r\noffspring, and there’s no better practical way to select the strongest\r\nand hardiest than by natural selection. We control their environment\r\nas little as possible and let Nature do our educating until they’re old\r\nenough to be useful.\r\n\r\n“Naturally, there are some things which we cannot provide, such as\r\nexposure to disease, to the elements, and to predators. The one isn’t\r\nselective about whom it infects, while the others would tend to produce\r\nco-operation as a matter of survival.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there a great deal of mortality under such a regimen?” Kennon\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Not as much as you might expect. It’s about twenty per cent. And there\r\nis a great deal of compensation from a management viewpoint. We get\r\nessentially the same physical end product as we would from a closely\r\nmanaged operation, plus a great saving in labor. Males, you see, are\r\nfairly expendable. We only need a few a year.”\r\n\r\n“It’s brutal.”\r\n\r\n“So it is, but life is brutal. Still, it’s efficient for our purposes.\r\nWe merely take advantage of natural impulses to produce a better\r\nproduct. Grandfather got the idea out of an old book--something about\r\nthe noble savage, natural selection and survival of the fittest. He\r\nthought it was great--said there was nothing like relentless competition\r\nto bring out the strongest and hardiest types. And he’s been right for\r\ncenturies. Can you imagine anything much better than George--from a\r\nphysical viewpoint?”\r\n\r\n“He is a magnificent animal,” Kennon admitted as he eyed the Lani. “But\r\nit seems to me that you could train some obedience into him.”\r\n\r\nDouglas shook his head. “That would introduce a modifying factor,\r\nsomething bigger and more powerful than the male himself. And that would\r\nmodify the results. We can control them well enough with knockout gas\r\nand shackles. And those things, oddly enough, don’t destroy their pride\r\nor self-esteem. They think that we use them because we are afraid, and\r\nit satisfies their egos.”\r\n\r\nKennon eyed the caged Lani dubiously. “This is going to be difficult.\r\nI must examine them and treat them, but if they’re all as homicidal as\r\nthis one--”\r\n\r\n“You fight me man,” George interrupted, his face twisted into lines of\r\ntransparent guile. “I am boss and others do as I say. You beat me, then\r\nyou are boss.”\r\n\r\n“Is this true?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s true enough,” Douglas said. “George is the leader and if you\r\nbeat him you’d be top male until some other one got courage enough to\r\nchallenge you. But he’s just trying to get his hands on you. He’d like\r\nto kill.”\r\n\r\nKennon looked at the big humanoid appraisingly. George was huge,\r\nat least five centimeters taller and fifteen kilograms heavier than\r\nhimself. And he was all muscle. “I don’t think I’d care to accept that\r\nchallenge unless I was forced to,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\nDouglas chuckled. “I don’t blame you.”\r\n\r\nKennon sighed. “It looks like we are going to need reinforcements to\r\nget these brutes under control. I’m not going in there with them, and I\r\ncan’t examine them from out here.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we can hold them all right. Paralysis gas and shackles will keep\r\nthem quiet. There’s no need to bother the troopers. We can handle this\r\nby ourselves.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. “It’s your baby. You should know what you’re doing.”\r\n\r\n“I do,” Douglas said confidently. “Wait here until I get the gas\r\ncapsules and the equipment.” He turned and walked back to the entrance\r\nto the cell block. At the iris he turned. “Be careful,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, I will.” Kennon looked at George through the bars and the\r\nhumanoid glared back, his eyes bright with hatred. Kennon felt the\r\nshort hairs prickle along the back of his neck. George roused a primal\r\nemotion--an elemental dislike that was deeper than reason--an antagonism\r\nintensely physical, almost overpowering--a purely adrenal response that\r\nhad no business in the make-up of a civilized human.\r\n\r\nHe had thought the Lani had a number of human traits until he had\r\nencountered George. But if George was a typical male--then the Lani were\r\nalien. He flexed his muscles and stared coldly into the burning blue\r\neyes behind the bars. There would be considerable satisfaction in\r\nbeating this monstrosity to a quivering pulp. Millennia of human\r\npre-eminence--of belief that nothing, no matter how big or muscular,\r\nshould fail to recognize that a man’s person was inviolate--fed the\r\nfuel of his anger. The most ferocious beasts on ten thousand worlds\r\nhad learned this lesson. And yet this animal had laid hands on him\r\nwith intent to kill. A cold corner of his mind kept telling him that he\r\nwasn’t behaving rationally, but he disregarded it. George was a walking\r\nneed for a lesson in manners.\r\n\r\n“Don’t get the idea that I’m afraid of you--you overmuscled oaf,” Kennon\r\nsnapped. “I can handle you or anyone like you. And if you put your hands\r\non me again I’ll beat you within an inch of your worthless life.”\r\n\r\nThe Lani snarled. “Let me out and I kill you. But you are like all men.\r\nYou use gun and iron--not fair fight.”\r\n\r\nDouglas returned with a gas capsule and a set of shackles. “All right,”\r\n he said. “We’re ready for him.” He handed Kennon the shackles and a key\r\nto the cell door--and drew his Burkholtz.\r\n\r\n“See,” the Lani growled. “It is as I say. Men are cowards.”\r\n\r\n“You know gun?” Douglas asked as he pointed the muzzle of the Burkholtz\r\nat the Lani.\r\n\r\n“I know,” George growled. “Gun kill.”\r\n\r\n“It does indeed,” Douglas said. “Now get back--clear back against the\r\nwall.”\r\n\r\nGeorge snarled but didn’t move.\r\n\r\n“I’ll count three,” Douglas said, “and if you’re not back by then\r\nI’ll burn you down. You’ll obey even if you won’t do anything\r\nelse.--one--two--”\r\n\r\nGeorge retreated to the far end of his cell.\r\n\r\n“Now face the wall.” Douglas tossed the gas capsule into the cell. The\r\nthin-walled container broke, releasing a cloud of vapor. George\r\ncrumpled to the floor. “Now we wait a couple of minutes for the gas to\r\ndissipate,” Douglas said. “After that he’s all yours. You can go in and\r\nput the irons on him.”\r\n\r\n“Will he be out long?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“About five minutes. After that he’ll have muscular control.” Douglas\r\nchuckled. “They’re stupid,” he said. “They know what gas does to them,\r\nbut they never have sense enough to hold their breath. They could be\r\ntwice as much trouble as they are. All right, it’s safe to go in now.”\r\n Douglas let the gun dangle in his hand.\r\n\r\nKennon unlocked the door.\r\n\r\nAnd George rolled over, muscles bunched and driving! He hit the door\r\nwith such force that Kennon was slammed against the wall, dazed--half\r\nstunned by the speed of the attack. George--he had time to think in one\r\nbrief flash--wasn’t stupid. He had held his breath for the necessary two\r\nminutes!\r\n\r\nDouglas jerked the blaster up and fired, but his target was too quick.\r\nGeorge dropped and rolled. The sizzling streak of violet flashed inches\r\nabove his body and tore a six-inch hole through the back of the cell.\r\nAnd then George was on him! The huge, marvelously fast hands of the\r\nhumanoid wrenched the blaster out of Douglas’s hands and jerked him\r\nforward. A scream burst from Douglas as George’s hands closed around his\r\nneck. Muscles sprang into writhing life in the humanoid’s huge forearms.\r\nThere was a soft, brittle crack, and Douglas sagged limp in the iron\r\ngrip that held him dangling.\r\n\r\n“Faugh!” George grunted. He dropped Douglas as Kennon pushed the door\r\nback and came out into the passageway. “Maybe you make better fight,”\r\n George said as he lowered his head into the muscular mass of his broad\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nKennon eyed him appraisingly, swinging the irons in his right hand.\r\n\r\nThis time the Lani didn’t charge. He moved slowly, half crouched, long\r\narms held slightly forward. Kennon backed away, watching the humanoid’s\r\neyes for that telltale flicker of the pupils that gives warning\r\nof attack. The expression on George’s face never changed. It was\r\nsatisfied--smug almost--reflecting the feelings of a brute conditioned\r\nto kill and given an opportunity to do so. The Lani radiated confidence.\r\n\r\nKennon shivered involuntarily. He wasn’t frightened, but he had never\r\nmet an opponent like this. A chill raced up the back of his legs and\r\nspread over his stomach and chest. His mouth was dry and his muscles\r\nquivered with tense anticipation. But his concentration never wavered.\r\nHis hard blue eyes never left George’s, searching with microscopic\r\nintentness for the faintest sign of the Lani’s intentions.\r\n\r\nGeorge charged--hands reaching for Kennon’s throat, face twisted in a\r\nsnarl of rage and hate. But even as he charged Kennon moved. He ducked\r\nbeneath the Lani’s outstretched hands and drove his left fist deep into\r\nGeorge’s belly just below the breastbone.\r\n\r\nAir whistled out of the Lani’s gaping mouth as he bent double from the\r\npower of the blow. Kennon clipped him on the chin with a driving knee,\r\nsnapping George’s head back and smashed the bearded face with the\r\nshackles. Blood spurted and George screamed with rage. One of the Lani’s\r\nbig hands wrapped around the shackles and tugged. Kennon let go and\r\ndrove another left to George’s ribs.\r\n\r\nThe Lani threw the irons at Kennon, but his aim was poor. One of the\r\nhandcuff rings scraped across Kennon’s cheek, but did nothing more\r\nthan break the skin. Half paralyzed by the blows to his solar plexus,\r\nGeorge’s co-ordination was badly impaired. But he kept trying. Kennon\r\nwrapped lean fingers about one of George’s outstretched hands, bent,\r\npivoted, and slammed the Lani with bone-crushing force against the bars\r\nof a nearby cell. But George didn’t go down. “He’s more brute than man,”\r\n Kennon thought. “No man could take a beating like that!” He moved aside\r\nfrom George’s stumbling rush, feeling a twinge of pity for the battered\r\nhumanoid. It was no contest. Strong as he was, George didn’t know the\r\nrudiments of hand-to-hand fighting. His reactions were those of an\r\nanimal, to close, clutch, bite, and tear. Even if he were completely\r\nwell, the results would have been the same. It would merely have taken\r\nlonger. Kennon drove a vicious judo chop to the junction of the Lani’s\r\nneck and shoulder. Brute strength was no match for the highly evolved\r\nmayhem that every spaceman learns as a necessary part of his trade.\r\nGeorge had never been on planet leave in a spaceport town. He knew\r\nnothing about the dives, the crimps, the hostile port police. His idea\r\nof fighting was that of a beast, but Kennon was a civilized man to whom\r\nfighting was an art perfected by millennia of warfare. And Kennon knew\r\nhis trade.\r\n\r\nEven so it took longer than Kennon expected because George was big,\r\nGeorge was strong, and George had courage and pride that kept him coming\r\nas long as the blazing will behind his blazing eyes could drive his\r\nbattered body. But the end was inevitable.\r\n\r\nKennon looked at his bloody arm where George’s teeth had reached their\r\nmark. It was hardly more than a scratch, but it had been close. George\r\nhad his lesson and Kennon felt oddly degraded. He sighed, dragged George\r\nback into the cell, and locked the door.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Douglas. The howls of hate from the caged Lani died to\r\na sullen silence as Kennon gently examined the limp body.\r\n\r\nDouglas wasn’t dead. His neck was dislocated, not broken, but he was in\r\nserious condition. Kennon was still bending over Douglas wondering how\r\nto call for help when three guards burst through the door, faces grim,\r\nweapons at the ready.\r\n\r\n“What’s going on here?” the leader demanded. “The board showed an\r\nopen door down here.” He saw the body--“Mr. Douglas!” he gasped. “The\r\ncommandant will have to know about this!” He took a communicator from\r\nhis waist belt and spoke rapidly into it. “Arleson in stud cell block,”\r\n he said. “Attempted escape. One casualty--Douglas Alexander--yes,\r\nthat’s right. No--he’s not dead. Send a litter and bearers. Inform the\r\ncommandant. I am making investigation on the spot. Out.” He turned to\r\nlook coldly at Kennon.\r\n\r\n“Who are you--and what happened here?” he asked.\r\n\r\nKennon told him.\r\n\r\n“You mean you took George!” Arleson said.\r\n\r\n“Look in his cell if you don’t believe me.”\r\n\r\nThe soldier looked and then turned hack to Kennon. There was awed\r\nrespect in his hard brown eyes. “You did that!--to him! Man, you’re a\r\nfighter,” he said in an unbelieving voice.\r\n\r\nA stretcher detail manned by two sober-faced Lani females came in,\r\nloaded Douglas’s body on the stretcher, and silently bore it away.\r\n\r\n“Douglas was a fool,” Arleson said. “He knew we never handle this kind\r\nwithout maximum restraint. I wonder why he did it?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t say. He told me that gas and shackles would hold him.”\r\n\r\n“He knew better. These Lani know gas capsules. All George had to do was\r\nhold his breath. In that cell George would have killed you. You couldn’t\r\nhave stayed away from him.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. Maybe that was what Douglas had wanted. Kennon sighed.\r\nHe didn’t have the answer. And it could just be that Douglas had tried\r\nto show off. Well, he would pay for it. He’d have a stiff neck for\r\nmonths, and perhaps that was a proper way to end it.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nCommander Mullins, a thin gray-faced man with the hard cold eyes of\r\na professional soldier, came into the corridor followed by another\r\ntrooper.\r\n\r\nHis eyes took in the wreckage that had been George, the split lips,\r\nthe smashed nose, the puffed eyes, the cuts and bruises, and then raked\r\nacross Kennon.\r\n\r\n“Spaceman--hey?” he asked. “I’ve seen work like that before.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded. “I was once. I’m station veterinarian now. Douglas called\r\nme over--said it was an emergency.”\r\n\r\nMullins nodded.\r\n\r\n“Well--why aren’t you tending to it?”\r\n\r\n“I have to examine them,” Kennon said gesturing at the cells. “And I\r\ndon’t want any more trouble like this.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry. You won’t have it. Now that you’ve beaten George, you’ll\r\nhave no trouble at all. You’re top dog.” Mullins gestured at the cages.\r\n“They’ll be good for a while. Now you’d better get on with your work.\r\nThere’s been enough disruption of routine for today. The men will help\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nKennon checked in at the commandant’s office before he left for the main\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n“How is Douglas?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He’s alive,” Mullins said. “We flew him to Albertsville--and good\r\nriddance. How are the Lani?”\r\n\r\n“They’ll be all right,” Kennon said. “It’s just food poisoning. I\r\nsuggest you check your kitchen and your food handlers. There’s a break\r\nin sanitation that could incapacitate your whole command. I found a few\r\nthings wrong but there are probably more.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll check on it--and thanks for the advice,” Mullins said. “Sit down,\r\nDoctor. Your airboat won’t be serviced for another few minutes. Tell me\r\nhow things are on the main island. How’s Blalok?”\r\n\r\n“You know him?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. I used to be a frequent visitor there. But with that young\r\npup here, I couldn’t leave. I didn’t dare to. He’d have disrupted\r\nroutine in a single day. Look what he did in half an hour. Frankly, I\r\nowe you a debt for getting him off my hands.” Mullins chuckled dryly.\r\n\r\n“That’s a fine thing to say,” Kennon grinned. “But I can sympathize. It\r\ntook us two months to straighten out Alexandria after the Boss-man sent\r\nhim here.”\r\n\r\n“I heard about that.”\r\n\r\n“Well--we’re under control now. Things are going pretty smoothly.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll be better here,” Mullins said. “Now that Douglas is gone.” He\r\nshrugged. “I hope the Boss doesn’t send him back. He’s hard to handle\r\nand he makes discipline a problem.”\r\n\r\n“Could you tell me--or would it be violating security?” Kennon said.\r\n“Why do you have a Class II installation on full war footing out here?”\r\n\r\nMullins chuckled. “It’s no secret,” he said. “There was a commercial\r\nraid on this place about fifty years ago. Seems as though one of our\r\ncompetitors didn’t like us. Alexandria was on a war footing then and\r\nmanaged to hold them off. But it scared the Old Man. You see, our\r\ncompetitive position is based on Lani labor. Our competitors didn’t know\r\nthat. Their intelligence wasn’t so good. Up until that time, we’d been\r\nkeeping the males out here in what was hardly more than a stockade.\r\nThose people could have taken a few dozen females and a couple of males\r\nand they’d have been in business. But they didn’t know. They tried to\r\nsmash Alexandria instead. Naturally they didn’t have a chance. And after\r\nit was over the Old Man got smart. He still had the tapes for Alexandria\r\nso he built a duplicate out here and spent a few millions on modern\r\narmament. The way we’re set now it’d take a battle group to hurt us.”\r\n\r\n“But how about security? Don’t the others know about the Lani now?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a moot question. But it won’t do them any good. They can’t crack\r\nthis place, and without males, all the females on Flora wouldn’t do\r\nthem enough long-term good to pay for the force they’d need to be\r\nsuccessful.”\r\n\r\n“So that’s why the males are isolated.”\r\n\r\n“There’s another reason--two of them in fact. One is physical. Even\r\nthe best male is a dangerous beast. They have a flair for violence that\r\nmakes them useless as labor and their training doesn’t help matters.\r\nAnd the other is mental. The females on the main island believe that we\r\nhumans are responsible for the continuation of their breed. This tends\r\nto keep them in line. We have a great deal more trouble with them out\r\nhere once they know the truth. We’ve had a number of cases of females\r\ntrying to engineer a male’s escape. But they’re never repeated,” Mullins\r\nsaid grimly. “Actually, it would be an interesting life out here, except\r\nfor the abattoir.” He grimaced. “That’s an unpleasant chore.”\r\n\r\n“You mean--” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly. What else could we do with senile animals?”\r\n\r\n“But that’s murder!”\r\n\r\nMullins shook his head. “No more than killing a cow for beef.”\r\n\r\n“You know,” Kennon said, “I’ve never thought of what happened to aged\r\nLani. Sure, I’ve never seen one, but--Lord Lister!--I’m a fool.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll get used to the idea,” Mullins said. “They aren’t human, and\r\nexcept for a few, they aren’t as intelligent as a Santosian Varl. I know\r\nthat they look like us except for those tails, but that’s as far as it\r\ngoes. I’ve spent two hundred years with them and I know what I’m talking\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what Alexander says.”\r\n\r\n“He should know. He’s lived with them all his life.”\r\n\r\n“Well--perhaps. But I’m not convinced.”\r\n\r\n“Neither was Old Doc--not until the day he died.”\r\n\r\n“Did he change then?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I wasn’t there. But Old Doc was a stubborn cuss.”\r\n\r\nKennon stood up. “I’ve given instructions for treatment to your\r\ncorpsman,” he said. “Now I think I’d better be getting back. I have some\r\nreports to finish.”\r\n\r\nMullins smiled grimly. “You know,” he said, “I get the feeling that you\r\ndon’t approve of this operation.”\r\n\r\n“Frankly, I don’t,” Kennon said, “but I signed a contract.” He turned\r\ntoward the door and gestured to the two Lani who waited outside with his\r\nbags. “I can find my way to the roof,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Well--good luck,” Mullins said. “We’ll call you again if we need you.”\r\n\r\n“Do that,” Kennon replied. He wanted to leave, to get away from this\r\nplace and back to the main island. He wanted to see Copper. He’d be\r\ndamned if anyone was going to butcher her. If he had to stay here until\r\nshe died of old age, he’d do it. But nobody was going to hurt her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nKennon wondered if his colleagues in human medicine felt toward their\r\npatients as he did toward the Lani, or if they ultimately lost their\r\nindividuality and became mere hosts for diseases, parasites,\r\nand tumors--vehicles for the practice of surgical and medical\r\nskills--economic units whose well-being meant a certain amount of\r\ncredits. Probably not, he decided. They were human and their very\r\nhumanity made them persons rather than things.\r\n\r\nBut the possession of individuality was not an asset in the practice of\r\nanimal medicine where economics was the main factor and the satisfaction\r\nof the owner the principal personality problem. The normal farm animals,\r\nthe shrakes, cattle, sheep, morks, and swine were no problem. They were\r\nmerely a job. But the Lani were different. They weren’t human, but they\r\nwere intelligent and they did have personality even though they didn’t\r\npossess that indefinable quality that separated man from the beasts. It\r\nwas hard to treat them with dispassionate objectivity. In fact, it was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAnd this lack of objectivity annoyed him. Should he be this way? Was he\r\nright to identify them as individuals and treat them as persons\r\nrather than things? The passing months had failed to rob them of their\r\npersonalities: they had not become the faceless mass of a herd of cattle\r\nor a flock of sheep. They were still not essentially different\r\nfrom humans--and wouldn’t men themselves lose many of their human\r\ncharacteristics if they were herded into barracks and treated as\r\nproperty for forty generations? Wouldn’t men, too, approach the animal\r\ncondition if they were bred and treated as beasts, their pedigrees\r\nrecorded, their types winnowed and selected? The thought was annoying.\r\n\r\nIt would be better, Kennon reflected, if he didn’t have time to think,\r\nif he were so busy he could drop to his bed exhausted each night and\r\nsleep without dreaming, if he could keep on the run so fast that he\r\nwouldn’t have time to sit and reflect. But he had done his work too\r\nwell. He had trained his staff too thoroughly. They could handle the\r\npetty routines of minor treatment and laboratory tests as well as he. He\r\nhad only the intellectual stimulation of atypical cases and these were\r\nall too rare. The routine inspections were boring, yet he forced himself\r\nto make them because they filled the time. The hospital wards were\r\nvirtually empty of patients, the work was up to date, the whole island\r\nwas enjoying a carnival of health, and Kennon was still impaled upon\r\nthe horns of his dilemma. It wasn’t so bad now that the first shock was\r\nover, but it was bad enough--and showed no signs of getting better. Now\r\nthat Copper realized he wanted her, she did nothing to make his life\r\neasier. Instead she did her best to get underfoot, usually in some\r\nprovocative position. It was enough to try the patience of a marble\r\nstatue Kennon reflected grimly. But it did have its humorous side\r\nand were it not for the fact that Copper wasn’t human could have\r\nbeen thoroughly enjoyable. That, however, was the real hell of it. He\r\ncouldn’t relax and enjoy the contest--his feet were on too slippery\r\nground. And Copper with her unerring female instinct knew just what to\r\ndo to make the footing slipperier. Sooner or later, she was certain that\r\nhe would fall. It was only a question of applying sufficient pressure at\r\nthe right spot and the right time. Now that she knew he desired her,\r\nshe was content to wait. The only thing that had bothered her was the\r\nuncertainty whether he cared or not. For Copper the future was a simple\r\nthing and she was lighthearted about it. But not so Kennon. Even after\r\nthe initial shock had passed there still remained the moral customs, the\r\nconditioning, and the prohibitions. But Copper--was Copper--and somehow\r\nthe conditioning lost its force in her presence. Perhaps, he thought\r\nwryly, it was a symptom of the gradual erosion of his moral character in\r\nthis abnormal environment.\r\n\r\n“I’m getting stale,” he confided to Copper as he sat in his office idly\r\nturning the pages of the Kardon Journal of Allied Medical Sciences.\r\n“There’s nothing to do that’s interesting.”\r\n\r\n“You could help me,” Copper said as she looked up from the pile of cards\r\nshe was sorting. He had given her the thankless task of reorganizing the\r\nfiles, and she was barely half through the project.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing to do that’s interesting,” he repeated. He cocked his\r\nhead to one side. From this angle Copper looked decidedly intriguing as\r\nshe bent over the file drawer and replaced a stack of cards.\r\n\r\n“I could suggest something,” Copper said demurely.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” he said. “You’re full of suggestions.”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking that we could go on a picnic.”\r\n\r\n“A what?”\r\n\r\n“A picnic. Take a lunch and go somewhere in the jeep. Maybe up into the\r\nhills. I think it might be fun.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” Kennon agreed. “At least it would break the monotony. Tell\r\nyou what. You run up to the house and tell Kara to pack a lunch and\r\nwe’ll take the day off.”\r\n\r\n“Good! I hoped you’d say that. I’m getting tired of these dirty old\r\ncards.” She stood up and sidled past the desk. Kennon resisted the\r\nimpulse to slap as she went past, and congratulated himself on his\r\nself-control as she looked at him with a half-disappointed expression\r\non her face. She had expected it, he thought gleefully. Score one for\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe smiled. Whatever the other Lani might be, Copper was different.\r\nQuick, volatile, intelligent, she was a constant delight, a flashing\r\nkaleidoscope of unexpected facets. Perhaps the others were the same if\r\nhe knew them better. But he didn’t know them--and avoided learning. In\r\nthat direction lay ulcers.\r\n\r\n“We’ll go to Olympus,” he said.\r\n\r\nCopper looked dubious. “I’d rather not go there. That’s forbidden\r\nground.”\r\n\r\n“Oh nonsense. You’re merely superstitious.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled. “Perhaps you’re right. You usually are.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the virtue of being a man. Even if I’m wrong, I’m right.” He\r\nchuckled at the peculiar expression on her face.\r\n\r\n“Now off with you--and get that lunch basket packed.”\r\n\r\nShe bowed. “Yes, master. Your slave flies on winged feet to execute your\r\ncommands.”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled. Copper had been reading Old Doc’s romances again. He\r\nrecognized the florid style.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nKennon landed the jeep in a mountain meadow halfway up the slope of\r\nthe peacefully slumbering volcano. It was quiet and cool, and the light\r\nbreeze was blowing Olympus’s smoky cap away from them to the west.\r\nCopper unpacked the lunch. She moved slowly. After all, there was plenty\r\nof time, and she wasn’t very hungry. Neither was Kennon.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go for a walk,” Copper said. “The woods look cool--and maybe we\r\ncan work up an appetite.”\r\n\r\n“Good idea. I could use some exercise. That lunch looks big enough to\r\nchoke a horse and I’d like to do it justice.”\r\n\r\nThey walked through the woods, skirting scant patches of underbrush,\r\nslowly moving higher on the mountain slopes. The trees, unlike those\r\nof Beta, did not end abruptly at a snow line, but pushed green fingers\r\nupward through passages between old lava flows, on whose black wrinkled\r\nsurfaces nothing grew. The faint hum of insects and the piping calls of\r\nthe birdlike mammals added to the impression of remoteness. It was hard\r\nto believe that scarcely twenty kilometers from this primitive microcosm\r\nwas the border of the highly organized and productive farmlands of\r\nOutworld Enterprises.\r\n\r\n“Do you think we can see the hospital if we go high enough?” Copper\r\nsaid. She panted a little, unaccustomed to the altitude.\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” Kennon said. “It is a long distance away. But we should be\r\nable to see Alexandria,” he added. “That’s high enough and big enough.”\r\n He looked at her curiously. “How is it that you’re so breathless?”\r\n he asked. “We’re not that high. You’re getting fat with too much soft\r\nliving.”\r\n\r\nCopper smiled. “Perhaps I’m getting old.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” Kennon chuckled. “It’s just fat. Come to think of it you\r\nare plumper. Not that I mind, but if you’re going to keep that sylphlike\r\nfigure you’d better go on a diet.”\r\n\r\n“You’re too good to me,” Copper said.\r\n\r\n“You’re darn right I am. Well--let’s get going. Exercise is always good\r\nfor the waistline, and I’d like to see what’s up ahead.”\r\n\r\nScarcely a kilometer ahead they came to a wall of lava that barred their\r\npath. “Oh, oh,” Kennon said. “We can’t go over that.” He looked at the\r\nwrinkled and shattered rock with its knifelike edges.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think my feet could take it,” Copper admitted.\r\n\r\n“It looks like the end of the trail.”\r\n\r\n“No--not quite,” Kennon said. “There seems to be a path here.” He\r\npointed to a narrow cleft in the black rock. “Let’s see where it goes.”\r\n\r\nCopper hung back. “I don’t think I want to,” she said doubtfully. “It\r\nlooks awfully dark and narrow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, stop it. Nothing’s going to hurt us. Come on.” Kennon took her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nUnwillingly Copper allowed herself to be led forward. “There’s something\r\nabout this place that frightens me,” she said uncomfortably as the high\r\nblack wails closed in, narrowing until only a slit of yellow sky was\r\nvisible overhead. The path underfoot was surprisingly smooth and free\r\nfrom rocks, but the narrow corridor, steeped in shadows, was gloomy and\r\ndepressingly silent. It even bothered Kennon, although he wouldn’t\r\nadmit it. What forces had sliced this razor-thin cleft in the dense\r\nrock around them? Earthquake probably. And if it happened once it could\r\nhappen again. He would hate to be trapped here entombed in shattered\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nGradually the passage widened, then abruptly it ended. A bleak vista of\r\nvolcanic ash dotted with sputter cones opened before them. It was a\r\nflat tableland, roughly circular, scarcely half a kilometer across,\r\na desolation of black rock, stunted trees and underbrush, and gray\r\nvolcanic ash. A crater, somewhat larger than the rest, lay with its\r\nnearest edge about two hundred meters away. The rock edges were fire\r\npolished, gleaming in the yellow sunshine, and the thin margin of trees\r\nand brush surrounding the depression were gnarled and shrunken, twisted\r\ninto fantastic shapes.\r\n\r\n“Hey! what’s this?” Kennon asked curiously. “That crater looks peculiar,\r\nlike a meteor had struck here--but those stunted plants--hmm--there\r\nmust have been some radioactivity too.” He looked at the crater\r\nspeculatively. “Now I wonder--” he began.\r\n\r\nCopper had turned a sickly white. “No!” she said in a half-strangled\r\nvoice--“oh, no!”\r\n\r\nKennon looked at her. “You know what this is?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“No,” Copper said. But her voice was unsteady.\r\n\r\n“You’re lying.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know.” Copper wailed. “I’m only guessing. I’ve never seen\r\nthis place before in my life! Please!--let’s get out of here!”\r\n\r\n“Then you know about this,” Kennon demanded.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s the Pit,” Copper said. “The redes don’t say where it is.\r\nBut the description fits--the Circle of Death, the Twisted Land--it’s\r\nall like the redes say.”\r\n\r\n“Redes?--what are redes? And what is this business about circles of\r\ndeath? There’s something here that’s peculiar and I want to know what it\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing. Truly. Just let’s go back. Let’s leave this place. It’s\r\nno good. It’s tabu.”\r\n\r\n“Tabu? You’ve never used that word before.”\r\n\r\n“Forbidden.”\r\n\r\n“Who forbids it?”\r\n\r\n“The Gods--the Old Ones. It is not for Lani. Nor for you.” Her voice was\r\nharsh. “Come away before it is too late. Before the Silent Death strikes\r\nyou down.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to have a look at this.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be killed!” Copper said. “And if you die, I die too.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be foolish. There’s nothing here that can hurt me. See those\r\ntrees and plants growing right up to the crater’s edge. If they can\r\ntake it permanently, I can stand it for a few moments. If there’s any\r\nradioactivity there, it’s not very much.”\r\n\r\n“But the redes say--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, forget those redes. I know what I’m doing. Besides, I’m a Betan and\r\ncan stand more radiation than most men. A brief exposure isn’t going to\r\nhurt me.”\r\n\r\n“You go and I go too,” Copper said desperately.\r\n\r\n“You’ll stay here where it’s safe,” Kennon said flatly.\r\n\r\n“I’m going with you,” Copper repeated. “I don’t want to live without\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I won’t be hurt. And one quick look isn’t going to bother\r\nwhatever’s down there.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what Roga the Foolish said when he opened Lyssa’s tower. But\r\nhe brought men to Flora. And your little look may bring an even greater\r\ncalamity.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged, and started Walking toward the crater’s edge.\r\n\r\nCopper followed.\r\n\r\nHe turned to order her back, but the words died on his tips as he saw\r\nthe terror and determination on her face. Neither commands nor pleas\r\nwould move her. If he went she would follow. The only way he could stop\r\nher would be with violence, and he didn’t want to manhandle her. He felt\r\nan odd mixture of pride, tenderness, and admiration for her. Were their\r\nsituations reversed, he doubted whether he would have the courage she\r\nwas showing. He sighed. Perhaps she was right. Perhaps he did need an\r\nantiradiation suit.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said. “You win. I’ll get some protective clothing and\r\nlook at it later.”\r\n\r\nHer knees sagged, but he caught her before she fell, and held her erect\r\nuntil her strength returned. Belatedly he understood the emotional\r\nstrain that had been gripping her. “If you come back later, sir, you’ll\r\ntake me with you.” The words were a statement, not a question.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. “Providing you wear a radiation suit,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe grimaced with distaste and he chuckled. Clothing and Copper simply\r\ndidn’t get along together.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“All right,” she said unhappily.\r\n\r\n“And there’s one more condition.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” she asked suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“That you tell me about this place. You obviously know something about\r\nit, and with all your talking, you’ve never mentioned it to me.”\r\n\r\n“It is forbidden to talk of these things to men,” Copper said--and then,\r\nperversely, “Do you want me to tell you now?”\r\n\r\n“No--it can wait. We have come a long way and I am hungry. I listen\r\npoorly on an empty stomach. Let’s go back to the jeep and you can tell\r\nme later.”\r\n\r\nCopper smiled. “That’s good,” she said. “I’d feel better away from this\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n“I was a poor learner of the redes,” Copper confessed. “And I’ll have to\r\nskip the Mysteries. I never even tried to learn them. Somehow I was sure\r\nI’d never be a preceptress.” She settled herself more comfortably on the\r\ntawny grass and watched him as he lay on his back beside her.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” Kennon said, “Preceptress?”\r\n\r\n“The guardians of our traditions. They know the redes and mysteries by\r\nheart.”\r\n\r\n“And you have kept your religion alive that way all these years?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t exactly religion,” Copper said. “It’s more like history, we\r\nlearn it to remember that we were once a great race--and that we may\r\nbe again. Someday there will come a male, a leader to bring us out of\r\nbondage, and our race will be free of dependence on men. There will\r\nbe pairings again, and freedom to live as we please.” She looked\r\nthoughtfully at Kennon. “You might even be the one--even though you are\r\nhuman. You’re different from the others.”\r\n\r\n“You’re prejudiced.” Kennon smiled. “I’m no different. Well--not very\r\ndifferent at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“That is not my thought,” Copper said. “You are very different indeed.\r\nNo man has ever resisted a Lani as long as you have.”\r\n\r\nKennon shook his head. “Let’s not go into that now. What are these\r\nredes?”\r\n\r\n“I do not remember them all,” Copper apologized. “I was--”\r\n\r\n“You’ve said that before. Tell me what you do know.”\r\n\r\n“I remember the beginning fairly well,” she said. “It goes back to the\r\ntime before Flora when everything was nothing and the Master Himself was\r\nlonely.”\r\n\r\nWithout warning her voice changed to a rhythmic, cadenced chant that\r\nwas almost a song. Her face became rapt and introspective as she rocked\r\nslowly from side to side. The rhythm was familiar and then he recognized\r\nit--the unintelligible music he had often heard coming from the barracks\r\nlate at night when no men were around--the voiceless humming that the\r\nLani sang at work.\r\n\r\nFirst there was Darkness--starless and sunless\r\n\r\nVoid without form--darker than night\r\n\r\nThen did the Master--Lord of Creation\r\n\r\nWave His right hand, saying, “Let there be light!”\r\n\r\nVerse, Kennon thought. That was logical. People remember poetry better\r\nthan prose. But the form was not what he’d normally expect. It was\r\nadvanced, a style that was past primitive blank verse or heroic\r\npentameter. He listened intently as Copper went on.\r\n\r\n     Light filled the heavens, bright golden glowing,\r\n     Brought to the Void by His wondrous hand;\r\n     Then did the Master--Lord of Creation--\r\n     Nod His great head, saying, “Let there be land!”\r\n      Air, land, and water formed into being,\r\n     Born in the sight of His all-seeing eyes;\r\n     Then did the master--Lord of Creation--\r\n     Smile as He murmured, “Let life arise!”\r\n      All of the life conceived by the Master,\r\n     Varied in shape as the grasses and birds;\r\n     Hunters and hunted, moveless and moving,\r\n     Came into form at the sound of His words.\r\n\r\n“That’s a great deal like Genesis,” Kennon said with mild astonishment.\r\n“Where could you have picked that up?”\r\n\r\n“From the beginning of our race,” Copper said. “It came to us with Ulf\r\nand Lyssa--but what is Genesis?”\r\n\r\n“A part of an ancient religion--one that is still followed on some of\r\nthe Central Worlds. Its followers call themselves Christians. They say\r\nit came from Earth, the mother-world of men.”\r\n\r\n“Our faith has no name. We are children of Lyssa, who was a daughter of\r\nthe Master.”\r\n\r\n“It is an odd similarity,” Kennon said. “But other races have had\r\nstories of the Creation. And possibly there may be another explanation.\r\nYour ancestors could have picked this up from Alexander’s men. They came\r\nfrom Earth originally and some of them could have been Christians.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Cooper said. “This rede is long before Man Alexander. It is\r\nthe origin of our world, even before Ulf and Lyssa. It is the first\r\nBook--the Book of the God-spell. Man Alexander came in the sixth\r\nBook--the Book of Roga.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no point in arguing about it,” Kennon said. “Go on--tell me the\r\nrest.”\r\n\r\n“It’s going to be a long story,” Copper said. “Even though I have\r\nforgotten some of it, I can chant the redes for hours.”\r\n\r\nKennon braced his back against one of the fat tires of the jeep. “I’m a\r\ngood listener,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe chuckled. “You asked for this,” she said--and took up the verses\r\nwhere she had left off. And Kennon learned the Lani version of creation,\r\nof the first man and woman, cast out of Heaven for loving each other\r\ndespite the Master’s objection, of how they came to Flora and founded\r\nthe race of the Lani. He learned how the Lani grew in numbers and power,\r\nhow they split into two warring groups over the theological point of\r\nwhether Ulf or Lyssa was the principal deity, how Roga the Foolish\r\nopened Lyssa’s tower to find out whether the Ulfians or Lyssans were\r\nright, and brought the Black Years to Flora.\r\n\r\nHe heard the trial of Roga and the details of his torture by the priests\r\nof Ulf and the priests of Lyssa--united by this greatest sacrilege. And\r\nhe heard the Lani version of the landing of Alexander’s ship and man’s\r\nconquest of Flora.\r\n\r\nIt was a story of savagery and superstition, of blood and intolerance,\r\nof bravery and cowardice, of love and beauty. Yet through it all, even\r\nthrough the redes that described the Conquest, there was a curious\r\nremoteness, a lack of emotion that made the verses more terrible as they\r\nflowed in passionless rhythm from Copper’s lips.\r\n\r\n“That’s enough!” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“I told you you wouldn’t like it.”\r\n\r\n“It’s horrible. How can you remember such things?”\r\n\r\n“We begin to learn them as soon as we can talk. We know the redes almost\r\nour entire lives.” Copper was silent for a moment. “There’s lots more,”\r\n she said, “but it’s all about our lives since the Man Alexander--the old\r\none--took possession of us. And most of the newer redes are pretty dull.\r\nOur life hasn’t changed much since the men came. The Book of Man is\r\nboring.” Copper sighed. “I have dared a great deal by telling you these\r\nthings. If the others knew, they would kill both of us.”\r\n\r\n“Then why tell me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I love you,” she said simply. “You wanted to know--and I can deny you\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nA wave of tenderness swept over him. She would give her life for\r\nhim--and what would he give? Nothing. Not even his prejudices. His face\r\ntwisted. If she was only human, If she wasn’t just an animal. If\r\nhe wasn’t a Betan. If, if, if. Resentment gorged his throat. It was\r\nunfair--so damned unfair. He had no business coming here. He should have\r\nstayed on Beta or at least on a human world where he would never have\r\nmet Copper. He loved her, but he couldn’t have her. It was Tantalus and\r\nSisyphus rolled into one unsightly package and fastened to his\r\nsoul. With a muttered curse he rose to his feet, and as he did he\r\nstopped--frozen--staring at Copper as though he had never seen her\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“How did you say that Roga was judged responsible for Alexander coming\r\nhere?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“He went into Lyssa’s tower--where Ulf and Lyssa tried to call\r\nHeaven--and with his foolish meddling set the tower alight with a glow\r\nthat all could see. Less than a week later the Man Alexander came.”\r\n\r\n“Where was this tower?”\r\n\r\n“Where Alexandria now stands. Man Alexander destroyed it and built his\r\nhouse upon its ruins.”\r\n\r\n“And what was that place of the Pit?”\r\n\r\n“The Shrine of Ulf--where the God-Egg struck Flora. It is buried in the\r\npit, but the Silent Death has protected it from blasphemy--and besides\r\nMan Alexander never learned about it. We feared that he would destroy it\r\nas he did Lyssa’s tower.”\r\n\r\nA wild hope stirred in Kennon. “We’re going home,” he announced.\r\n\r\n“Good.”\r\n\r\n“And we’re going to get a pair of radiation suits--and then we’re coming\r\nback. We’ll have a good look at that Pit, and if what’s in there is what\r\nI think it is”--his face was a mixture of grimness and eagerness--“we’ll\r\nblow this whole operation off this planet!”\r\n\r\nCopper blanched. “It is death to meddle with the God-Egg,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Superstition!” Kennon scoffed. “If that Egg is what I think, it was\r\nmade by men, and you are their descendant.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you’re right, but I can’t help thinking you are wrong,” she\r\nsaid soberly. “Look at the trouble that came with Roga’s meddling. Be\r\ncareful that you do not bring us a worse fate.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be very careful. We’ll take every precaution.”\r\n\r\n“We?”\r\n\r\n“You’re coming, of course. I can’t imagine you staying away.”\r\n\r\nCopper nodded.\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t worry so much,” Kennon teased. “You know we men live\r\nforever.”\r\n\r\n“That is true.”\r\n\r\n“And if I’m right you’re just as human as I. And you’re capable of\r\nliving as long as I do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” Copper said. Her voice was unconvinced, her expression\r\nnoncommittal.\r\n\r\n“You females,” Kennon said in quick exasperation. “You drive a man\r\ncrazy. Get an idea in your head and it takes triatomate to blast it out.\r\nNow let’s go.”\r\n\r\nTwo hours brought them back to the volcanic area, and knowing what to\r\nlook for, Kennon located the pockmarked mountain valley. From the air it\r\nlooked completely ordinary. Kennon was amazed at the perfection of the\r\nnatural camouflage. The Pit was merely another crater in the pitted\r\nground. He dropped to a lower altitude, barely a hundred feet above the\r\nsputter cones. “Look!” he said.\r\n\r\nBelow them was the crater of the Pit and in its center a smooth\r\nbluish-black hemisphere protruded from the crater floor. It would have\r\npassed unnoticed by the casual eye--nearly concealed by two gigantic\r\nblocks of pumice.\r\n\r\n“The God-Egg!” Copper exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Egg--ha! that’s a spacer! I thought it would be. I’d recognize durilium\r\nanywhere. Let’s go down and look this over, but first we want a couple\r\nof pictures.” He pointed a camera at the crater and snapped the shutter.\r\n“There--now let’s have a closer look at our baby.”\r\n\r\n“Do you expect me to get into that thing?” Copper said distastefully as\r\nshe prodded the shapeless green coveralls with a bare toe. She eyed the\r\nhelmet, gloves and boots with equal distaste. “I’d suffocate.”\r\n\r\n“If you want to come with me, you’ll wear it,” Kennon said. “Otherwise\r\nyou won’t come near that pit. Try it and I’ll chain you to the jeep.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t!”\r\n\r\n“Just try me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--all right. I’ll wear the thing--but I won’t be comfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Who cares about that? You’ll be protected.”\r\n\r\n“All right--show me how to put it on. I’d rather be with you than worry\r\nabout what you are doing.”\r\n\r\nThe suit was several sizes too large but it covered her adequately.\r\nToo adequately, Kennon decided. She looked like a pile of wrinkles with\r\nlegs. He chuckled.\r\n\r\nShe glared. “So I’m funny,” she said. “Let me tell you something else\r\nthat’s funny. I’m hot. I’m sweating. I itch. Now--laugh!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t feel like laughing,” Kennon said. “I feel the same way.”\r\n\r\nThey approached the edge of the Pit carefully. Kennon kept checking\r\nthe radiation counter. The needle slowly rose and steadied at one-half\r\nroentgen per hour as he thrust the probe over the rim of the depression.\r\n“It’s fine, so far,” he said encouragingly. “We could take this much\r\nfor quite a while even without suits.” He lowered himself over the edge,\r\nsliding down the gentle slope.\r\n\r\n“How is it down there?” Copper called. The intercom crackled in his ear.\r\n\r\n“Fine--barely over one roentgen per hour. With these suits we could\r\nstay here indefinitely.” The sigh of relief was music in her ears. “This\r\nplace is barely lukewarm.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what you think,” Copper said.\r\n\r\n“I mean radiation warm,” Kennon said. “Stay up there and watch me. I may\r\nneed some things.”\r\n\r\n“All right.” Copper squirmed inside the hot suit. The thing was an oven.\r\nShe hoped that Kennon didn’t plan to work in the daytime. It would be\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nKennon gingerly approached the ship. It was half buried in the loose\r\ndebris and ash that had fallen or blown into the pit during the\r\ncenturies it had rested there. It was old--incredibly old. The hull\r\ndesign was ancient--riveted sheets of millimeter-thick durilium. Ships\r\nhadn’t been built like that in over two thousand years. And the ovoid\r\nshape was reminiscent of the even more ancient spindizzy design. A\r\nhyperspace converter like that couldn’t be less than four millennia\r\nold. It was a museum piece, but the blue-black hull was as smooth and\r\nunblemished as the day it had left fabrication.\r\n\r\nSpace travel would have gotten nowhere without durilium, Kennon\r\nreflected. For five thousand years men had used the incredibly tough\r\nsynthetic to build their spacecraft. It had given man his empire. Kennon\r\ngave the hull one quick glance. That part of the ship didn’t worry him.\r\nIt was what he would find inside that bothered him. How much damage had\r\noccurred from two thousand or more years of disuse? How much had the\r\noriginal travelers cannibalized? How much could be salvaged? What sort\r\nof records remained? There were a thousand questions that the interior\r\nof that enigmatic hull might answer.\r\n\r\nThe upper segment of the airlock was visible. It was closed, which was a\r\ngood sign. A few hours’ work with a digger should expose it enough to be\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n“Copper,” he said, “we’re going to have to dig this out. There’s a small\r\nexcavator in the cargo bed of the jeep. Do you think you can bring it\r\ndown here?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\n“Good girl!” Kennon turned back to the ship. He was eager to enter it.\r\nThere might be things inside that would settle the question of the Lani.\r\nThe original crew had probably recognized the value of the hull as\r\na repository as well as he did. But in the meantime there would be\r\nwork--lots of it. And every step must be recorded.\r\n\r\nIt was the rest of the day’s work to expose the emergency airlock. The\r\nlittle excavator toiled over the loose ash for hours before it displaced\r\nenough to make the port visible, and the ash was not yet cleared away\r\nsufficiently to open the portal when darkness brought a halt to the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to unearth the spaceship with their low-capacity\r\ndigger, Kennon decided. It would be difficult enough to clear the\r\nemergency airlock in the nose. But if the tubes and drive were still\r\nall right, by careful handling it should be possible to use the drive to\r\nblast out the loose ash and cinders which surrounded the hull.\r\n\r\nKennon reluctantly gave up the idea of entering the spaceship. That\r\nwould have to wait until tomorrow. Now they would have to conceal the\r\nwork and call it a day. A few branches and the big blocks of pumice\r\nwould suffice for temporary camouflage. Later they could make something\r\nbetter. Anything in the jeep which might be useful was cached along with\r\nthe radiation suits in the passageway through the lava wall--and in a\r\nsurprisingly short time they were heading homeward.\r\n\r\nKennon was not too displeased. Tomorrow they would be able to enter\r\nthe ship. Tomorrow they would probably have some of the answers to his\r\nquestions. He looked ahead into the gathering night. The gray mass of\r\nthe abandoned Olympus Station slipped below them as he lined the jeep\r\nalong the path indicated by the luminous arrow atop the main building,\r\nset the controls on automatic, and locked the craft on the guide beacon\r\nin Alexandria’s tower. In a little less than an hour they would be home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nKennon was morally certain that the Lani were of human stock. Evolved,\r\nof course. Mutated. Genetic strangers to the rest of humanity. But\r\nhuman. The spaceship and the redes proved it as far as he was concerned.\r\nBut moral certainty and legal certainty were two different things. What\r\nhe believed might be good enough to hold up in a Brotherhood court, but\r\nhe doubted it. Ulf and Lyssa might be the founders of the Lani race, but\r\nthey had come to Kardon nearly four thousand years ago and no records\r\nexisted to prove that the Lani weren’t here before they came. Redes\r\npassed by word of mouth through hundreds of generations were not\r\nevidence. Even the spaceship wasn’t the absolute proof that would be\r\nneeded to overturn the earlier legal decision. Other and better\r\nproof was needed--something that would stand up in any court in the\r\nBrotherhood. He hoped the spaceship would hold that proof.\r\n\r\nBut Kennon’s eagerness to find out what was inside the ancient spacer\r\nwas tempered by hard practicality. Too much depended on what he might\r\nfind inside that hull. Every step of the work must be documented beyond\r\nany refutation. Some method of establishing date, time, and location had\r\nto be prepared. There must be a record of every action. And that would\r\nrequire equipment and planning. There must be no mistake that could be\r\ntwisted by the skillful counsel that Alexander undoubtedly retained.\r\n\r\nHe had no doubt that the Family would fight. Too much money and\r\nprestige were involved. To prove the Lani human would destroy Outworld\r\nEnterprises on Kardon. Yet this thought did not bother him. To his\r\nsurprise he had no qualms of conscience. He was perfectly willing to\r\nviolate his contract, break faith with his employers, and plot their\r\nruin. The higher duty came first--the duty to the human race.\r\n\r\nHe smiled wryly. It wasn’t all higher duty. There were some personal\r\ndesires that leavened the nobility. To prove Copper human was enough\r\nmotivation--actually it was better than his sense of duty. Events,\r\nKennon reflected, cause a great deal of change in one’s attitude.\r\nAlthough not by nature a plotter, schemes had been flitting through his\r\nmind with machinelike regularity, to be examined and discarded, or to be\r\nset aside for future reference.\r\n\r\nHe rejected the direct approach. It was too dangerous, depended too much\r\non personalities, and had too little chance for success. He considered\r\nthe possibility of letters to the Brotherhood Council but ultimately\r\nrejected it. Not only was the proof legally insufficient to establish\r\nhumanity in the Lani, but he also remembered Alexander’s incredible\r\nknowledge of his activities, and there was no reason to suppose that\r\nhis present didn’t receive the same scrutiny as the past. And if he,\r\nwho hadn’t written a letter in over a year, suddenly began to write, the\r\ncorrespondence would undoubtedly be regarded with suspicion and would\r\nprobably be examined, and Dirac messages would be out for the same\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nHe could take a vacation and while he was away from the island he\r\ncould inform the Brotherhood. Leaving Flora wouldn’t be particularly\r\ndifficult, but leaving Kardon would be virtually impossible. His\r\ncontract called for vacations, but it expressly provided that they would\r\nbe taken on Kardon. And again, there would be no assurance that his\r\nactivities would not be watched. In fact, it was probable that they\r\nwould be.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing that could be done immediately. But there were certain\r\nlong-range measures that could be started. He could begin preparing a\r\ncase that could be presented to the Council. And Beta, when it knew,\r\nwould help him. The situation of the Lani was so close to Beta’s own\r\nthat its obvious merit as a test case simply could not be ignored. If\r\nhe could get the evidence to Beta, it would be easy to enlist the aid\r\nof the entire Medico-Technological Civilization. It would take time and\r\nattention to detail; the case, the evidence, everything would have to\r\nbe prepared with every safeguard and contingency provided, so that there\r\nwould not be the slightest chance of a slip-up once it came to court.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps the best method of bringing the evidence would be to\r\ntransport it under its own power. The thought intrigued him. Actually it\r\nwouldn’t be too difficult. Externally the Egg wasn’t in bad shape. The\r\nvirtually indestructible durilium hull was still intact. The controls\r\nand the engines, hermetically sealed inside the hull, were probably as\r\ngood as the day they stopped running. The circuitry would undoubtedly be\r\nbad but it could be repaired and restored, and new fuel slugs could be\r\nobtained for the engine and the converter. But that was a problem for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThe immediate problem was to get into the ship in a properly documented\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nIt took nearly two months, but finally, under the impersonal lenses of\r\ncameras and recorders, the entrance port of the God-Egg swung open and\r\nrevealed the dark interior. Kennon moved carefully, recording every step\r\nas he entered the black orifice in the spaceship’s side. His handtorch\r\ngave plenty of light for the recorders as he moved inside--Copper at his\r\nheels, both of them physically unrecognizable in antiradiation suits.\r\n\r\n“Why are we moving so slowly?” Copper said. “Let’s go ahead and find out\r\nwhat’s beyond this passageway.”\r\n\r\n“From a superstitious coward you’ve certainly become a reckless\r\nexplorer,” he said.\r\n\r\n“The Egg hasn’t hurt us, and we’ve been around it many times,” she said.\r\n“Either the curse has become too old to hurt us, or there never was any\r\nin the first place. So let’s see what is ahead. I’m curious.”\r\n\r\nKennon shook his head. “In this business we must hurry slowly--very\r\nslowly. You know why.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to see.”\r\n\r\n“Patience, girl. Simmer down. You’ll see soon enough,” Kennon said. “Now\r\nhelp me set up this camera.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right--but isn’t there any excitement in you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m bubbling over with it,” Kennon admitted, “but I manage to keep it\r\nunder control.”\r\n\r\n“You’re cold-blooded.”\r\n\r\n“No--I’m sensible. We want to nail this down. My future, yours, and that\r\nof your people depend upon how carefully we work. You wouldn’t want to\r\nlet us all down by being too eager, would you?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “No--you’re right of course. But I still would like\r\nto see.”\r\n\r\nThey moved cautiously through the airlock and into the control room.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Kennon said with satisfaction. “I hoped for this, but I didn’t\r\ndare expect it.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Look around. What do you see?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing but an empty room. It’s shaped like half an orange, and it has\r\na lot of funny instruments and dials on the walls, and a video screen\r\noverhead. But that’s all. Why--what’s so unusual about it? It looks just\r\nlike someone had left it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the point. There’s nothing essential that’s missing. They didn’t\r\ncannibalize the instruments--and they didn’t come back.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe because that curse you mentioned a few minutes ago was real.”\r\n\r\nCopper drew back. “But you said it wouldn’t hurt us--”\r\n\r\n“Not now. The heat’s practically gone, but when whoever flew this crate\r\ncame here, the whole shell could have been as hot as a Samarian summer.”\r\n\r\n“But couldn’t they have come back when it cooled?”\r\n\r\n“Not with this kind of heat. The hull was probably too radioactive to\r\napproach from the outside. And radioactivity cools off slowly. It might\r\ntake several lifetimes for its level to become low enough to approach if\r\nthere was no decontamination equipment available.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that’s why the early ones thought the Egg was cursed.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded. “Now let’s check--oh! oh! what’s this?” He pointed to a\r\nmetal-backed book lying on the control panel.\r\n\r\n“It looks like a book,” Copper said.\r\n\r\n“I’m hoping it’s the book.”\r\n\r\n“The book?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--the ship’s log. It’s possible. And if it is, we may have all the\r\nevidence we need--Copper!--Don’t touch it!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because its position has to be recorded first. Wait until we get the\r\ncamera and recorders set up.”\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nGingerly Kennon opened the ancient book. The sheets inside were\r\nbrittle--crumbling with age--but he could make out the title U.N.S.S.\r\nWanderer with the date of launching and a lower line which read “Ship’s\r\nLog.” Kennon was thankful for his medical training. The four years\r\nof Classical English that he had despised so much were essential now.\r\nStumbling over unfamiliar words and phrases, he moved slowly through\r\nthe log tracing the old ship’s history from pleasure craft to short-haul\r\nfreight tractor to obsolescence in a space dump orbiting around a world\r\ncalled Heaven.\r\n\r\nThere was a gap of nearly ten years indicated by a blank page before the\r\nentries resumed.\r\n\r\n“Ah--this is it!” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Copper said curiously. “I can’t read the writing.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you can’t. It’s in English--a language that became\r\nobsolete during the Interregnum. I had to learn it, since most medical\r\nterminology is based on it.”\r\n\r\n“What is an Interregnum?” Copper interrupted. “I’ve never heard that word\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a period of confusion when there is no stable government. The last\r\none came after the Second Galactic War--but never mind that--it happened\r\nlong ago and isn’t important now. The important thing that did happen\r\nwas the Exodus.”\r\n\r\n“What was that?”\r\n\r\n“A religious revival and a tremendous desire to see what was happening\r\nbeyond the next star. During that century men traveled wider and farther\r\nthen they ever have before or since. In that outward explosion with\r\nits mixed motivations of religion and practicality, colonists and\r\nmissionaries went starward to find new worlds to tame, and new races to\r\nbe rescued from the darkness of idolatry and hell. Almost any sort\r\nof vehicle capable of mounting a spindizzy converter was pressed into\r\nservice. The old spindizzies were soundly engineered converters of\r\nalmost childlike simplicity that could and did carry ships enormous\r\ndistances if their passengers didn’t care about subjective time-lag, and\r\na little radioactivity.\r\n\r\n“And that’s what happened to this ship. According to this log it was\r\nbought by Alfred and Melissa Weygand--a missionary couple with the idea\r\nof spreading the Christian faith to the heathen.\r\n\r\n“Alfred and Melissa--Ulf and Lyssa--they were a part of this ancient\r\nexplosion that scattered human seed across parsecs of interstellar\r\nspace. It seems that they were a unit in a missionary fleet that had\r\ngone out to the stars with flame in their hearts and Gospel on their\r\nlips to bring the Word to the benighted heathen on other worlds.”\r\n Kennon’s lips curled with mild contempt at their stupid foolhardiness\r\neven as his pulse quickened to their bravery. They had been fanatics,\r\ntrue enough, but theirs was a selfless fanaticism that would risk\r\ntorture and death for what they believed--a fanaticism that was more\r\nsublime than the concept of Brotherhood which had evolved from it. They\r\nknew nothing of the enmity of race, of the incessant struggle man\r\nhad since waged with alien intelligences all too willing to destroy\r\nintruders who encroached upon their worlds. Mankind’s early selflessness\r\nhad long ago been discarded for frank expansionism and dominance over\r\nthe lesser races that stood in their way. And in a way it was too bad.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s log, meticulously kept in neat round English script, told a\r\nstory that was more than the bare bones of flight. There was passion\r\nand tenderness and a spiritual quality that was shocking to a modern\r\nman steeped in millennia of conquest and self-interest. There was a\r\ngreatness to it, a depth of faith that had since been lost. And as\r\nKennon slowly deciphered the ancient script he admired the courage even\r\nas his mind winced with dismay at the unheeding recklessness.\r\n\r\nThe Weygands had lost contact with the others, and had searched for them\r\nin hyperspace, doubling and twisting upon their course until they had\r\nbecome hopelessly lost, and then, with their fuel nearly exhausted, had\r\nbroken out into the normal three-space continuum to find Kardon’s sun\r\nand the world they called Flora.\r\n\r\nHow little they had known and how lucky they had been.\r\n\r\nIt was only by the grace of their God that they had found this world\r\nbefore their fuel was exhausted. And it was only by further grace that\r\nthe planet was habitable and not populated with intelligent life. They\r\nhad more luck than people were entitled to in a dozen lifetimes. Against\r\nodds of a million to one they had survived.\r\n\r\nIt was fascinating reading.\r\n\r\nBut it was not proof.\r\n\r\nThe last entry read: “We have circled this world and have seen no\r\nbuildings--no sign of intelligent life. We are lost, marooned on this\r\nempty world. Our fuel supplies are too low for us to attempt to find the\r\nothers. Nor could we. The constellations in the sky are strange. We do\r\nnot know which way to go. Therefore we shall land upon the great island\r\nin the center of the yellow sea. And perhaps someday men will come to us\r\nsince we cannot return to them. Melissa thinks that this is an example\r\nof Divine Providence, that the Lord’s mercy has been shown to us that\r\nwere lost in the vastness of the deep--that we have been chosen, like\r\nEve and Adam, to spread the seed of man to yet another world. I hope\r\nshe is right, yet I fear the radiation level of the ship has become\r\ninordinately high. We may well be Eve and Adam, yet an Adam that cannot\r\nbeget and an Eve that is not fruitful. I am trimming the ship for\r\nlanding, and we shall leave it immediately after we have landed, taking\r\nwith us only what we absolutely need. There is too much radiation from\r\nthe spindizzy and the drive to remain here longer--and God knows how hot\r\nthe outer hull may be.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was all. Presumptive evidence--yes. Reasonable certainty--yes.\r\nBut not proof. Lawyers could argue that since no direct exploration was\r\nmade there was no valid reason to assume that the Lani did not already\r\ninhabit Kardon. But Kennon knew. His body, more perceptive than his\r\nmind, had realized a truth that his brain would not accept until he read\r\nthe log. It was at once joy and frustration. Joy that Copper was human,\r\nfrustration that he could not obtain for her and her race the rights\r\nto which they were entitled. But the immediate problem was solved. His\r\nconditioning was broken now he was convinced that Copper was a member\r\nof the human race. It was no violation of his code to love her. The\r\ngreatest barrier was broken, and with it gone the lesser ones would\r\nyield. Relief that was almost pain washed through him and left him weak\r\nwith reaction.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Copper asked as he turned to her. “What is this thing that\r\nhas turned your face to joy?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you guess?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “I have seen nothing but you reading this ancient\r\nbook, yet you turn to me with the look in your eyes that the redes say\r\nUlf had for Lyssa.”\r\n\r\n“You’re human!”\r\n\r\nCopper shrugged. “You’re mad. I’m a Lani. I was born a Lani--and I shall\r\ndie one.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you understand? All Lani are human. You all are the descendants\r\nof two humans who came here thousands of years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Then there is no reason why you cannot love me.”\r\n\r\nKennon shook his head. “No,” he said. “There is no reason.”\r\n\r\nCopper laughed. It was a sound so merry and gay that Kennon looked at\r\nher in surprise. She looked as happy as she sounded.\r\n\r\nSimple and savage, Kennon thought. She cared nothing for the future, and\r\nprobably very little about the injustice of her present. The thing that\r\nmattered was that what had kept them apart was gone. She was probably\r\noffering mental sacrifices to the Old Ones who had caused this change\r\nin the man she loved. She didn’t really care about what had caused the\r\nchange. To her it was sufficient that it had happened.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Kennon wished that it could be as simple for him as it\r\napparently was for her. The fact that Copper was human posed a greater\r\nproblem than the one it solved. The one had been personal. The other was\r\ninfinitely greater. He could not let it lie. The very morality which had\r\nkept him from doing what he wished when he thought she was a humanoid\r\nnow forced him to do what he did not wish. Every instinct said to leave\r\nit alone. The problem was too great for one man to solve, the situation\r\ntoo complicated, the evidence too inconclusive, the opposition too\r\npowerful. It would be far better to take his happiness and enjoy it.\r\nIt was not his problem to solve. He could turn the evidence over to\r\nthe Brotherhood once his contract was over, and better and more capable\r\npeople than he could settle the Lani legal status. But the inner voice\r\nthat had called him bestial now called him shirker, coward, and slacker.\r\nAnd this, too, could not be borne. The case of the Lani would have to\r\nbe pursued as vigorously as he could do it. They were entitled to human\r\nrights--whether they wanted them or not.\r\n\r\nHis first idea of making the spacer operational was a good one, Kennon\r\ndecided as they finished the inspection of the ship. Even if it was\r\nnever used it would make a good means of retreat. He grinned wryly. In a\r\nguerrilla operation such as the one he was considering it would be wise\r\nto have a way out if things got too hot. The heavy parts, the engines\r\nand the controls, were in workable condition and would merely require\r\ncleaning and oiling. Some of the optical equipment would have to be\r\nreplaced and fuel slugs would have to be obtained for the drive--but\r\nnone of these would be too hard to accomplish. The slugs from any of the\r\npower reactors on the island would serve nicely. All that would have\r\nto be done would be to modify the fuel ports on the ship’s engine. The\r\nspindizzy would have to be disassembled and checked, and the main leads,\r\nembedded in time-resistant plastic, would have to be examined. The most\r\nserious problem, however, wouldn’t involve these things. The control\r\nboard wiring and circuitry was where the trouble would lie. Normal\r\ninsulation and printed circuitry wasn’t designed to last for thousands\r\nof years. Each wired circuit would have to be removed, duplicated, and\r\nreplaced. Every printed panel would have to be cleaned and receive a new\r\ncoat of insulating varnish. Working full time, a four-man electronics\r\nteam could do the job in a week. Working part-time the two of them might\r\nget it done in three months. And the other jobs would take at least\r\nanother. Add a month for errors in judgment, lack of materials, and\r\nmistakes--and another for unavoidable delays--it would be at least six\r\nmonths before the Egg would be spaceworthy.\r\n\r\nSix months.\r\n\r\nNot too long if everything went well, but far too long if there were\r\nany mistakes. He would have to be careful, yet he must not give the\r\nimpression of being careful. He shook his head. Being a subversive was\r\ngoing to require a greater amount of acting ability than he had ever\r\nbeen called upon to display.\r\n\r\nAnd what of Copper? How would she behave under the double strain of\r\nknowledge that she was human and knowledge of the spaceship? Women\r\nweren’t noted for their tight-lipped reticence. Would she tell the other\r\nLani? Would she crack under the pressure? Did she have the qualities of\r\na good conspirator?\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, he didn’t need to worry. As a partner in crime, Copper\r\nwas all that could be wished. Everything was normal. She was still\r\nobedient, helpful, and gay as ever. To watch her, no one would ever\r\nthink that her bright head was full of knowledge that could rock Flora\r\nto its foundations. Never by look or word did she betray the slightest\r\ntrace of strain or guilt.\r\n\r\nAnd in her other moments she was ecstatic in her love and helpful with\r\nthe repair work on the Egg whenever Kennon could get time to visit the\r\nold spaceship.\r\n\r\n“You amaze me,” Kennon said as they eased the cover of the spindizzy\r\nin place and spun the bolts on the lugs that held it to the outer\r\nshielding. He picked up a heavy wrench and began methodically to seat\r\nthe bolts as Copper wiped the white extrusion of the cover sealant from\r\nthe shining case.\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“The way you hide your knowledge of this ship from the others. I know\r\nyou better than anyone else on this island, and yet you would fool me.”\r\n\r\n“We Lani are used to hiding things. You men have been our masters for\r\ncenturies, yet you do not know our redes. Nor do you know what we think,\r\nWe obey you, but there are parts of us you do not own. It is easy to\r\nhide a little thing like this.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded. It figured. He seated another bolt. Three more and\r\nthe drive room would be restored and they could start on the control\r\ncircuits. “I wish you were as clever about adopting human customs as you\r\nare about hiding guilty knowledge,” he said.\r\n\r\nCopper laughed. “You mean those silly things you have been teaching me?\r\nWhy should I learn them? I’m happy as I am. I love you, you love me, and\r\nthat is all that matters.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not all that matters. Can’t you get it through your head that\r\ncivilized customs are necessary in a civilized society?” He gave the\r\nnext-to-last bolt an extra-vicious wrench. “You’ll have to know them if\r\nyou expect to get along on Beta.”\r\n\r\n“But I will never see Beta.”\r\n\r\n“I am going there when my duty here is over. And you’re going with me.”\r\n\r\n“When will that be?”\r\n\r\n“Three years.”\r\n\r\n“So long? Well--we can think of it then, but I don’t think Man Alexander\r\nwill let you take me.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall take you without his consent.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled. “It would be easier to stay here. In another fifteen years I\r\nwill be old and you will not want me.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll never do that. I’ll always want you.”\r\n\r\n“You swear too easily,” she said gently. “You men live forever. We Lani\r\nare a short-lived race.”\r\n\r\n“But you needn’t be. It’s obviously--”\r\n\r\n“It’s been tried, my love--and those who were treated died. Man\r\nAlexander tried many years ago to make us long-lived like you. But he\r\nfailed. You see, he loved one of us too.”\r\n\r\n“But--”\r\n\r\n“Let us think no more of it. Let us enjoy what we have and be grateful\r\nto the Gods for the love we enjoy--or do you have any Gods?”\r\n\r\n“One.”\r\n\r\n“Two are better. More, anyway. And besides, Ulf and Lyssa and the\r\nGod-Egg are responsible for our joy.”\r\n\r\n“They are indeed,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“Then why should you think of leaving the place where they rule? You\r\nshould stay here. There will be other Lani when I am gone. You will be\r\nhappy always.”\r\n\r\n“Not without you,” Kennon said. “Don’t you understand that I love you?”\r\n\r\n“And I you. But I am a Lani. You are a man.”\r\n\r\n“You’re as human as I am,” Kennon said abruptly.\r\n\r\n“That is what you say,” Copper replied. “I am not so sure. I need more\r\nproof than this.” She waved her hand at the ship.\r\n\r\n“What proof do you need?”\r\n\r\n“The same as the proof you men require. If I should have your child,\r\nthen I would believe that I was human.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve told you a thousand times that the radiation on this ship must\r\nhave affected Ulf and Lyssa’s germ plasm. Can’t you understand that?”\r\n\r\n“I can understand it all right, but it does not change things. Ulf and\r\nLyssa may have been human before they came here, but they were not when\r\nthey landed. They were Lani, and their children were Lani.”\r\n\r\n“But they were of human stock.”\r\n\r\n“The law that lets men become our masters does not agree with you.”\r\n\r\n“Then the law is wrong. It should be changed.”\r\n\r\nCopper shrugged. “Two people cannot change a law.”\r\n\r\n“They can try--particularly if the law is unjust.”\r\n\r\nCopper sighed. “Is it not enough for us to love? Must you try to run\r\nthrough a wall?”\r\n\r\n“When the wall stands in the way of right and justice I must.”\r\n\r\nCopper looked at him with pity in her green eyes. “This I do not\r\nunderstand. I know nothing of right and justice. What are these things?\r\nJust words. Yet you will endanger our happiness for them. If it is my\r\nhappiness you wish--then leave this foolishness alone. I have fifteen\r\nyears I can live with you before I am old and you tire of me. With those\r\nyears I can be content.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t,” Kennon said. “Call me selfish if you wish, but I want you\r\nwith me as long as I live. I don’t want to live my life without you.”\r\n\r\n“You want too much,” Copper said softly. “But if it makes you happy to\r\ntry to get it, I shall help. And if we do not succeed you will at least\r\nbe happier for trying. And if you are happy”--she shrugged--“then the\r\nrest makes little difference.”\r\n\r\nThat was the crux of the matter, Kennon reflected bitterly. He was\r\nconvinced she was human. She was not. And until her mind could be\r\nchanged on that point she would help him but her heart wouldn’t be in\r\nit. And the only thing that would convince her that she was human would\r\nbe a child--a child of his begetting. He could perhaps trick her with\r\nan artificial insemination of Lani sperm. There were drugs that could\r\nsuspend consciousness, hypnotics that would make her believe anything\r\nshe was told while under their influence.\r\n\r\nBut in the end it would do no good. All witnesses in Brotherhood court\r\nactions were examined under psychoprobe, and a hypnotic was of no value\r\nagainst a lie detector that could extract the deepest buried truth.\r\nAnd he would be examined too. The truth would out--and nothing would be\r\ngained. In fact--everything would be lost. The attempt at trickery would\r\nprejudice any court against the honest evidence they had so painfully\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nHe sighed. The only thing to do was to go on as they were--and hope that\r\nthe evidence would hold. With Betan legal talent at their back it\r\nmight. And, of course, they could try to produce a child as nature had\r\nintended. They could try--but Kennon knew it would not succeed. It never\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCopper had been acting strangely of late, Kennon thought as he rolled\r\nover in his bed and watched her standing before the full-length mirror\r\non the bathroom door. She pivoted slowly before the glass, eying herself\r\ncritically, raising her arms over her head, holding them at her sides,\r\nflexing her supple spine and tightening muscles that moved like silken\r\ncords beneath her golden skin.\r\n\r\n“What are you trying to do--become a muscle dancer?” Kennon asked idly.\r\n\r\nShe whirled, a crimson blush deepening the tan of her face. “You were\r\nsupposed to be asleep,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I’m an unregenerate heel,” he replied, “and I don’t sleep too well\r\nnowadays unless you’re beside me.”\r\n\r\n“Well--I suppose you might as well know now as later,” she said. “You’ll\r\nknow in any event.”\r\n\r\n“Know what?”\r\n\r\n“That you’re right. I am human.”\r\n\r\n“And what brought on this sudden change of--” He stopped abruptly, his\r\neyes widening.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Copper said. “I am with child. Your child.”\r\n\r\n“But that’s impossible.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “It’s a miracle perhaps, but it’s not impossible.\r\nIt’s happened. Can’t you see the difference?”\r\n\r\n“See what? You look just as you always do.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you can’t see it yet,” she admitted. “But I am with child.\r\nI’m two weeks past my time.”\r\n\r\nKennon’s mind leaped to the obvious conclusion. Pseudo-pregnancy. He had\r\nseen it before among Lani at Hillside Farm. It was an odd syndrome\r\nwhich occasionally occurred in humans and animals. The brain, desiring\r\nchildren, made demands upon the body and the body responded to its\r\ndesire by tricking the brain. Lani were fairly subject to it probably\r\nbecause they had better imaginations. He would run a few tests when they\r\nwent down to the hospital, and once she realized the practical joke her\r\nbody was playing everything would be all right. No wonder she seemed\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\n“We’ll find out about that later,” he said equably. “We’ll settle this\r\nwhen we get back to the hospital.”\r\n\r\nCopper smiled confidently and patted her stomach. “I know what you are\r\nthinking, but you’re wrong. We Lani know about these things. In forty\r\ngenerations I am the first to conceive as the Master intended.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you haven’t,” Kennon said with such bitter sincerity that Copper\r\nlooked at him wide-eyed. “Not now. Because if you have, neither your\r\nlife nor mine is safe.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“The Alexanders. Do you think they’ll take it lying down? We’re not\r\nready for them yet. They’ll fight, and the first thing they’ll do is\r\nkill you and erase me so we would never be able to talk. You have been\r\ndeclared an animal, and you will not be allowed to change.”\r\n\r\n“What can we do?” Copper asked. She shivered. “I do not want to die.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I want you to,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“I could tell the others.”\r\n\r\n“And just what would that accomplish?”\r\n\r\n“In a week every Lani on the island would know it. There would be\r\nrevolt. For the Lani would no longer be dependent upon Men to survive.\r\nTheir greatest hold on us would be gone. And we would be free again on\r\nour island world.”\r\n\r\n“You would not!” Kennon said. “That sort of thinking is foolishness.\r\nAlexander would have men here within a week, and a week after that you\r\nwould be smashed. Don’t you realize that there are thousands of millions\r\nof men in the galaxy--and to every one of them you would be animals. You\r\nknow nothing about what you would face. Your puny hundreds couldn’t even\r\nstand against a fraction of the power Alexander could mount against you.\r\nHave you seen a Burkholtz blaster work? Have you seen remote-control\r\nantipersonnel missiles? Have you push-pull projectors, atomic warheads?\r\nAll of these weapons Alexander can command. Don’t you realize he’s an\r\nentrepreneur?--one of the most powerful men in this sector?”\r\n\r\nCopper shook her head. “No,” she said in a small voice. “I know nothing\r\nabout these things.”\r\n\r\n“And do you think forty generations of absolute obedience to men can be\r\novercome because one Lani says she is pregnant by a man?”\r\n\r\nCopper frowned. “You put that in a different way. You talk as if it were\r\nmy belief rather than the truth.”\r\n\r\n“What is truth?” Kennon said heavily. “Who would believe you? There are\r\nhundreds of others with child.\r\n\r\n“Sure you’re human. You know it. I know it. I’ve been trying to convince\r\nyou for the past two months. You’re just as human as I am. But pray that\r\nyou’re not pregnant. We can’t get out of here in less than four months\r\nand by then everybody will know about you. Someone will certainly check\r\nthe records. And after that will come the psychoprobes. Everything will\r\ncome to light. The Egg will be destroyed. I will be erased. You will be\r\ndead. And that will be the end of it.” He looked down at her with an odd\r\nexpression of pity on his face. “You see?” he demanded harshly.\r\n\r\nCopper nodded. “I didn’t understand,” she said. “Don’t be angry with me.\r\nI shouldn’t have told you. I thought you’d be happy.”\r\n\r\n“I was never angry with you, but I am with myself. I was stupid. I\r\ndidn’t figure on the remote possibility that we might be genetically\r\ncompatible. I should have my head examined for putting you in such\r\ndanger. However there’s the possibility--the probability--that your body\r\nis playing a trick upon you.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “You are wrong. I am not mistaken. I am with child\r\nand the child is yours. But the fault is no more yours than mine. I\r\nwanted you before you looked on me. I still do and I do not feel at\r\nfault. That I am yours, that my child is yours is a thing of wonder and\r\njoy. Never could I have expected so much.”\r\n\r\nKennon looked down at her smudged face, streaked with the sudden\r\nrivulets of tears, and bitterness galled his throat. Dear God--let her\r\nbe wrong, he prayed silently. Let it be pseudopregnancy this time. Let\r\nthe tests be negative.\r\n\r\nBut they weren’t. Unequivocally they confirmed Copper’s diagnosis. Here\r\nwas the proof he needed. The final test that would prove the Lani human.\r\nAnd he had no way of getting it where it would do any good. It would\r\ntake at least four months of steady labor before the ship was ready, and\r\nhe didn’t have that sort of time. He was needed here and his prolonged\r\nabsence would cause suspicion and investigation. Something would have to\r\nbe done--but what? He couldn’t take Copper off the island in an airboat.\r\nThey were checked with microscopic care by Otpen One’s IFF. A jeep\r\ndidn’t have enough range to take them to the mainland. And even if they\r\ngot there they couldn’t get off the planet. Alexander knew everything\r\nthat happened on Kardon’s two spaceports. The Egg was the only way, but\r\nthe Egg was unfinished and unspaceworthy.\r\n\r\nFrantically Kennon considered concealing Copper. He shook his head. It\r\nwouldn’t work. It would be impossible, to hide a baby on a place where\r\nevery birth was recorded. Nor could one hide evidence of pregnancy in a\r\nLani. Childbearing leaves telltale marks upon the body, and Copper, even\r\nif she could be concealed for the duration of her pregnancy, could never\r\nsurvive the sharp-eyed scrutiny of her fellows or the other humans.\r\nQuestions would inevitably be asked.\r\n\r\nThere had to be a solution. He rubbed his forehead wearily. It was\r\nstrange how so little a thing as the union of a spermatozoon and an ovum\r\ncould produce so much trouble. He looked across the office at Copper\r\nplacidly filing case cards. She wasn’t worrying. With sublime faith,\r\nshe was sure that he would find the answer, the one that would solve\r\neverything. He shuddered. The only logical solution was abortion--and\r\nthat was unthinkable! He would not murder his child--nor would Copper\r\npermit it if he was capable of doing so.\r\n\r\nIt was almost a relief when his phone rang and Blalok’s voice came\r\ncheerfully across the wire.\r\n\r\n“Tried to get you about an hour ago,” the superintendent said, “but your\r\ngirl said you were busy.”\r\n\r\n“I was.”\r\n\r\n“You through now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, get up to the fortress. Alexander just flew in and he’s calling a\r\nmeeting. Something important has come up.”\r\n\r\nSomething important! A wave of ice rattled down Kennon’s spine, and then\r\nhe grinned feebly. Alexander didn’t know. He couldn’t know. It had to be\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be right up,” he said, marveling at the calmness in his voice.\r\n\r\nKennon couldn’t help comparing this meeting with the one a year ago.\r\nThe location was different--the conference room in Alexandria was more\r\nformal than Blalok’s parlor but the same people were present: Alexander,\r\nBlalok, Jordan, and himself. Somehow Alexander seemed to have shrunk. He\r\nwas no longer as impressive as he had been. But the man still radiated\r\nforce, even though it didn’t seem quite so overpowering. The year,\r\nKennon thought, had done much to build his self-confidence. He felt\r\nassured rather than nervous.\r\n\r\n“Good to see you, Kennon,” Alexander said. “Reports say you’re doing a\r\ngood job.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t claim the credit,” Kennon said. “Eighty-five per cent of our\r\nsuccess is due to co-operation from the operating staff. And that’s\r\nBlalok’s doing--he knocked the heads of the division managers together\r\nand they took care of their staffs. Otherwise we could have had a bad\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“But you didn’t,” Alexander said. “And you were the motive force.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve darn near motivated myself out of a job,” Kennon said. “They\r\nco-operate all too well nowadays.”\r\n\r\n“Which goes to prove that my theories on preventive medicine are right,”\r\n Alexander said, turning to Blalok.\r\n\r\n“It looks that way,” Blalok admitted, “but that could be because you\r\npicked a good man.”\r\n\r\n“He’s good in more ways than one,” Alexander said. “Or did he tell you\r\nhe saved Douglas’s life out on Otpen One?”\r\n\r\n“He’s never said a word.”\r\n\r\nAlexander smiled. “Another point in his favor. He knows how to keep his\r\nmouth shut.”\r\n\r\n“Not when he’s telling someone what to do about disease,” Jordon\r\ninterjected.\r\n\r\n“Or telling someone off when they haven’t followed directions,” Blaiok\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n“Better and better. I was sure that he was the one we needed when we\r\nfirst met.”\r\n\r\nKennon felt his ears turn flaming red.\r\n\r\n“But that’s not the reason I brought you here. This isn’t a Jac Kennon\r\nadmiration society. I called you because I want to expand the Lani\r\nbreeding program.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Jordan asked.\r\n\r\nBlalok stiffened. “You know my feeling about that, sir. I’ve never liked\r\nthe idea of selling them. If that’s what’s in your mind--”\r\n\r\nAlexander shook his head. “Simmer down,” he said, as he seated himself\r\nat the head of the table. “There’s going to be no selling. The Lani are\r\ntoo valuable for that. We’ll need them more than the money they’d bring\r\non the market. You see--I’ve acquired a planet out on the periphery. A\r\nplace called Phoebe. One of our ships found it, and I staked a discovery\r\nclaim on the major land mass, and the crew made lesser claims that\r\ncovered all the available land. Last month the Brotherhood allowed the\r\nclaims. Last week the crewmen sold me their land. Phoebe’s a lovely\r\nplace--quite a bit like Flora--and the ecological tests show it’s\r\ncapable of supporting mammalian life. Just before I came here I sent\r\nthree shiploads of exterminators to clean it up and make it ready for\r\nus. It should be ready in two years.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of an ecology are you exterminating?” Jordan asked.\r\n\r\n“Not that it makes any difference,” Alexander said, “but it’s mainly\r\nreptilian. Nothing over Group I. We’ll restock with Floran animals.”\r\n\r\nJordan sighed. “Since that’s the way it is, it doesn’t make any\r\ndifference,” he said. “But it could have. The Lani are sensitive to\r\nthings like that. If they thought that they were walking in over a pile\r\nof bodies they’d do badly. It’d be like Olympus all over again. And we\r\ncouldn’t keep them from knowing. We talk and we forget, but they’d tell\r\neach other--and they’d remember.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” Alexander said, “somehow they’ve never forgotten that\r\nGrandfather trapped the last of the Lani males on Olympus.”\r\n\r\nJordan nodded. “They can’t stand the place. That’s why we had to abandon\r\nthe station.”\r\n\r\n“Does this new world have a moon?” Kennon asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Yes--in fact it has two.”\r\n\r\n“Habitable?”\r\n\r\n“No--they’re too small to hold air. But men could live there in\r\ndomes--but why do you?--oh! I see! I hadn’t considered that point.”\r\n Alexander’s hand darted to the phone beside him. “Get me Albertsville,”\r\n he snapped. “Yes, my offices--I want Mr. Oliver in purchasing and\r\ncontracting. Hello--Ward? Alexander here. Yes--everything’s fine. I\r\nhave a job for you--use your scrambler-pattern two.” Alexander\r\ndialed the scrambler code on the second dial at the base of the phone,\r\neffectively preventing eavesdropping by beam tappers. “Yes,” he went on.\r\n“It’s Project Phoebe. Have you secured title to the moons? You haven’t?\r\nWell--you’d better do it before some of our competitors get bright\r\nideas. Sure they know about the project--do you think they’re stupid?\r\nWarren over at Consolidated practically told me that he was onto our\r\nscheme. So get title to those moons. Since they’re uninhabitable and\r\nwithin the planet’s primary field they come under the Spatial Debris Act\r\nand you should be able to get Kardonian title without any great amount\r\nof trouble. Naturally we want them.--For defense--what else? We’ll have\r\nmost of our eggs in that basket. No--I don’t know how we overlooked that\r\npoint. But if it wasn’t for a bright young man out here we’d have left\r\nourselves wide open. Now get cracking--get that leak plugged!” Alexander\r\ndropped the phone back in its cradle and sighed. “Well--that’s buttoned\r\nup,” he said. “Thanks, Kennon.”\r\n\r\nKennon looked at Alexander’s grinning face, his own impassive, but a\r\nshattering certainty exploded in his mind--Alexander was a telepath!\r\nThat was his difference! That was the thing that made him feared and\r\nrespected by his business associates. It wouldn’t have been enough on\r\nthe Central Worlds, where men knew of sensitives and took precautions\r\nagainst them. But out here on the periphery it was a deadly advantage.\r\n\r\n“So I gave it away,” Alexander said. “I suppose I was careless, but your\r\nthoughts about the moons shocked me.”\r\n\r\n“You practically told me once before, when you hired me,” Kennon said,\r\n“but I never realized it.”\r\n\r\n“You were too excited then.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t know,” Kennon said. “At any rate I didn’t add the facts\r\ncorrectly.” From somewhere deep in his memory an old quip came floating\r\nto the surface: “An executive is a man who picks brains--others’\r\nbrains.” By that definition Alexander was an executive of the first\r\nclass. Alexander chuckled.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Kennon wanted to run. Panic flooded him! What had he been\r\nthinking about? Had he thought of--two times two are four, four times\r\nfour are sixteen, sixteen times sixteen are--let’s see, six times\r\nsixteen is ninety-six, one times sixteen is--six, five, carry\r\none--two--two hundred fifty-six. Two hundred fifty-six times--\r\n\r\n“What’s eating you?” Alexander demanded.\r\n\r\n“I’m angry,” Kennon said. “I told you the conditions I’d sign that\r\ncontract, and you wrote a Peeper Clause into it. And then you peep in\r\nthe worst way possible. There’s no defense against a Telep unless\r\nyou know about him; you’ve had my whole mind bare! You’ve violated my\r\npersonal privacy like no man has done before. Sure I’m mad. I expected\r\nhonesty from you--and you peep!” The anger was stronger now--a wave of\r\nraw emotion based on a lifetime of training in mutual respect of a man’s\r\nprivacy--a feeling intensified by his childhood environment of a crowded\r\nplanetary ecology and the cramped crew quarters on a spaceship. To\r\nKennon, Alexander had committed the ultimate sin.\r\n\r\n“I can see I made a mistake by not telling you,” Alexander said. His\r\nvoice was cold. “But you have no right to insult me.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not saying it, am I?” Kennon snapped. The moonflower on the\r\nbookcase behind Alexander was a thing of beauty. Alexander liked beauty.\r\nHe had said so, and the Great Hall below them bore it out. It was a\r\nlovely room. Those four bronze Lani in the fountain were works of art.\r\nOne of them looked remarkably like Copper. Copper in bronze. The little\r\nwitch had probably posed for the casting. Maybe it had even been made\r\nfrom her body.\r\n\r\n“They’re all of Susy,” Alexander said. “I can see why you are angry, and\r\nI don’t blame you. But remember I warned you about Lani.”\r\n\r\nCopper--Kennon wrenched his thoughts back to the moonflower. It had\r\ntwelve petals, limpid white on the borders shading to deep blue in the\r\ncenter-from which the cream-colored stamen surrounded by transparent\r\npistils sprang to burst into a golden glory of pollen that dripped\r\nin tiny yellow flecks to the broad petals below. It was a magnificent\r\nflower. There was nothing like it on Beta. That was a marvelous thing\r\nabout flowers--wherever one went in the universe, plants used the same\r\nmethods to fertilize their seed and spread their germ plasm. It was too\r\nbad that--Kennon jerked his attention to Alexander’s face. He detested\r\nthe thought that his mind was common property. A man should have\r\nsomething he can call his own. There had been a clinics instructor\r\nin Year Six who was a sensitive. The classes had protected themselves\r\nagainst his prying with a circlet--a thought screen--he had done it too.\r\nMaybe he had brought the circlet with him. If he did, no one was going\r\nto catch him without it. It was a dirty business, this reading of\r\nothers’ thought. Now where had he put that circlet? Was it among his old\r\nbooks--or was it with his instruments?\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you go back to your house and find it?” Alexander snapped.\r\n“As you are, you’re nothing but a disruption. I want you in on this\r\nmeeting, but not the way you’re acting.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to act any other way until I get some protection from\r\npeeping,” Kennon said grimly. “And if you think this is bad wait till I\r\nstart going through comparative anatomy.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with you two?” Blalok asked.\r\n\r\n“Be quiet,” Alexander snapped. “This isn’t your problem. Kennon is\r\nbehaving like a spoiled child!”\r\n\r\n“He’s a telepath!” Kennon said. “And he didn’t tell me.”\r\n\r\n“So what? I’ve known that for years.”\r\n\r\n“And you stand for it?”\r\n\r\n“I’m a Mystic, not a Betan,” Blalok said. “I don’t have your insane\r\ndesire for privacy.”\r\n\r\n“Go find that thought screen if you still have it!” Alexander said. “I\r\ndon’t want any more of this. You’re making me ill!”\r\n\r\nKennon grinned thinly as he rose to his feet. It was a good thing he\r\nremembered Alexander was squeamish and didn’t like anatomy. The door\r\nwas to his left, an iris door with eight leaves--terribly old-fashioned.\r\nAbout ten steps away. Count them--one--two--three--\r\n\r\nAlexander sighed as Kennon left the room. “I certainly pushed the panic\r\nbutton on that young man,” he said. “He has a pathological attitude\r\ntoward telepathy. Wonder what he has to hide that he wants privacy so\r\nbadly? Even for a Betan this reaction was violent.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know. He’s a pretty emotional sort. Maybe he hates to look\r\nlike a fool. He’s gotten himself mixed up with one of the Lani. Cute\r\nlittle thing by the name of Copper,” Blalok said.\r\n\r\n“Oh--that’s it. I thought that was what he was hiding. A picture of\r\na girl kept popping up.” Alexander chuckled. “I suppose that’s the\r\ntrouble. A man hardly likes to look a fool, particularly to someone\r\nwho has warned him. At that, I don’t blame him. They are beautiful and\r\naffectionate. And even with their superstitions and tabus they’re better\r\nthan most humans.”\r\n\r\n“For pets,” Blalok said heavily.\r\n\r\n“They’re not better at anything,” Jordan demurred. “They can’t be--man\r\nis the best and always will be.”\r\n\r\n“The eternal racial chauvinist,” Alexander murmured. He turned his\r\nattention to Blalok. “But for awhile, Evald, I’d suggest you keep an\r\neye on our young man. I still don’t like his reaction. It was too\r\nviolent--too defensive. I don’t feel right about it. Perhaps Betans are\r\nmore sensitive than most people but it seems to me that he’s trying\r\nto conceal something. There was an undertone of fear--and something\r\nelse--beneath his defenses.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t you get any more than that?” Blalok asked. “You’re pretty good\r\nat this mind-reading business.”\r\n\r\n“His defenses were remarkably good,” Alexander said dryly.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nWell he’d done it now, Kennon thought. He found the thought-screen\r\ncirclet sandwiched between two books on comparative neuroanatomy which\r\nhe hadn’t bothered to unpack. He slipped it on and connected the lead\r\nwires to a portable battery pack. There was a half-forgotten tingling\r\nas the weak field heterodyned his thought waves. Kennon sighed. If\r\nAlexander wasn’t suspicious of him now the man was a fool. He’d done as\r\nwell as he could with confusion and outrage, but it was hardly possible\r\nto hide behind superficialities. Even the most disciplined mind couldn’t\r\ndo that without some preparation. Undoubtedly his concern about Copper\r\nhad leaked through. He could only hope that other and more important\r\nthings had not.\r\n\r\nWell--he could go back to the conference now, but he would have to be\r\ndoubly careful from now on. He couldn’t make daily trips to Olympus. His\r\nreaction had killed that plan. Alexander would be suspicious now--and\r\nunusual actions would crystallize suspicion to certainty. Now he needed\r\na reason to be in that area. And then he grinned. He had a reason--a\r\ngood one--one that would fit in with Alexander’s plans and his own.\r\nThe only problem would be to make Alexander buy it--and that might be\r\ndifficult. He’d have to work carefully--but with normal luck he could\r\nput the idea across. He crossed his fingers as he trudged back up the\r\npath to Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe conference dragged on. Unlike most meetings, this one accomplished\r\nthings--which was a tribute to Alexander’s ability to keep the subject\r\nin hand. Details of the expansion program presented by Alexander were\r\nrapidly reduced to workable plans. They involved some rearrangement of\r\nexisting facilities, and the construction of others. But the obvious\r\nsnags were rapidly disposed of, and the whole revamped operation was\r\noutlined on paper in surprisingly few hours. A deadline date was set,\r\nconstruction was authorized, and in the morning the first steps in the\r\npractical implementation of the new program would be taken.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s that,” Alexander said with a sigh. “I think this calls for\r\na drink.”\r\n\r\n“There’s one more thing,” Kennon said. “I know it isn’t much, but\r\nJordan’s remark started me thinking.”\r\n\r\n“What remark?” Jordan asked.\r\n\r\n“The one you made at the beginning about Phoebe possibly being like the\r\nOlympus Station. I’ve often wondered why that particular location has\r\nbeen so difficult to operate. Sure, I know the accepted explanation,\r\nbut I think we should learn why it works and how to break a tabu. If we\r\ndon’t, we might be in for trouble.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a good thought,” Alexander said. “I tried to find out once, but\r\nall I could discover was that it was tabu. The Lani simply didn’t like\r\nit. And despite the fact that I can read minds, I didn’t learn any more\r\nthan that. There’s a certain sex-linkage to telepathy, as you probably\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded.\r\n\r\n“All I could discover was that their dislike of Olympus was a basic\r\nemotion rather than reasoned thought. They were nervous, irritable,\r\ndisobedient, and uncooperative while they were there--and even they\r\ndidn’t know why. It was merely tabu. We even tried youngsters--but the\r\nattitude was the same. I’d like to know more about that basic emotion.”\r\n\r\n“We should understand it,” Kennon agreed. “If we transship a large\r\nnumber of Lani to a strange world, we should know their deepest\r\nmotivations. We cannot take the chance that the transplant won’t take,\r\nwith all the money you’re sinking into this project.”\r\n\r\n“You have a point there. Have you any suggestions about how to\r\naccomplish this?” Alexander’s voice was interested.\r\n\r\n“I have. Hire a psychologist. And reopen Olympus.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll be the same story,” Jordan said.\r\n\r\n“Not if you apply experimental procedure,” Kennon said. “Divide the\r\nplace into a number of separate units in which groups of--say ten--Lani\r\nof various ages are kept. Let every group know where they are, but don’t\r\nlet them come in contact with one another. Observe them constantly. Put\r\nspy cells in the units. Couple them to recorders. Prepare a set of test\r\nsituations and observe how each group performs. Question individuals\r\nunder narcosynthesis. Observe and record any changes in physical\r\ncondition--give them the works. Maybe we can collect some basic data\r\nthat will indicate the answer.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bad idea,” Alexander said.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like it,” Jordan said. “It sounds cumbersome.”\r\n\r\n“It is,” Kennon agreed. “But it may save a great deal of trouble later.”\r\n\r\n“I think you’re right, Kennon,” Blalok said. “We should know everything\r\nwe can.”\r\n\r\n“What would you do first if you were heading this program?” Alexander\r\nasked. He eyed Kennon critically.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” Kennon said promptly. “I’m not qualified to run an\r\ninvestigation like this. You need a specialist. I am a practitioner.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm--but you know experimental procedure.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally--but I do not have the training to prepare a program or\r\nevaluate its results. The only thing I could do would be to check the\r\nphysical condition of the experimental groups.”\r\n\r\n“Could you set up the physical facilities?” Alexander asked.\r\n\r\n“Possibly--I’d need a set of plans of the station, and I couldn’t\r\nguarantee that the specialist wouldn’t want to make changes. But the\r\nphysical arrangements should be simple enough to construct.”\r\n\r\n“How long would it take you to prepare a plan?”\r\n\r\n“I could have it by tomorrow, or perhaps a day later.”\r\n\r\n“If you can do it by then I’ll stay over. I’d like to examine this\r\nproposal more closely. It has merit. That’s the second constructive\r\nsuggestion you’ve made tonight. Despite your peculiar desire for\r\nprivacy, I’m glad you came back.” Alexander smiled.\r\n\r\nKennon smiled back. Apparently the entrepreneur had taken the bait.\r\nBut it was too early to tell whether he had swallowed it without\r\nreservation. It all depended upon how much had been given away before\r\nhe had discovered that Alexander was a telepath. Perhaps Alexander was\r\nmerely leading him on. There were too many intangibles, and there was no\r\nway of predicting how it would turn out. But he felt mildly optimistic.\r\n\r\nAlexander closed the meeting, and Kennon left promptly. He had a good\r\nexcuse. There was plenty of work to do if he was going to prepare an\r\nadequate plan for utilizing Olympus Station. Jordan went with him,\r\nbut Blalok stayed behind. It was natural enough. Blalok was the\r\nadministrator, but Kennon felt uneasy. Nor would he have felt any better\r\nif he could have heard what went on after he left.\r\n\r\nAlexander looked quizzically at Blalok after the door closed behind the\r\ntwo men.\r\n\r\n“Well, Evald, what do you think? Does it strike you that Kennon’s\r\nsincere--or does it sound as though he has something up his sleeve?”\r\n\r\n“If he does,” Blalok said, “I don’t know what it could be. I wouldn’t\r\ntake a job on Olympus if you gave it to me.”\r\n\r\n“If he doesn’t know about the place,” Alexander said thoughtfully, “it’s\r\nprobable that his suggestion was honest. I think it is but I’m not sure.\r\nHe worries me now that I can’t read him. I think I’ll send Douglas back\r\nhere to watch him.”\r\n\r\n“Why? In my book that’d be a poor choice. After all, you said Kennon\r\nsaved his life. He should be grateful.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know Douglas,” Alexander said. “He hates Kennon’s guts for\r\nwhat he did.”\r\n\r\n“What did he do?”\r\n\r\n“He made Douglas feel inferior. And there’s no surer way to gain my\r\ncousin’s undying enmity.” Alexander laughed. “I know,” he said. “He’d\r\nlike to kill me, too.”\r\n\r\nBlalok shrugged.\r\n\r\n“But in the meantime I want you to keep an eye on Kennon. If his outline\r\nis all right, I’m going to authorize him to set up this experiment. I\r\nwant to give him every possible chance. I like him--and he’s done good\r\nwork. I wouldn’t want him to feel that I distrust him.”\r\n\r\n“Which you do, of course,” Blalok said dryly.\r\n\r\nAlexander smiled. “Actually,” he said with equal dryness, “I distrust\r\neveryone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n“If you think this job is easy, you have another think coming,” Kennon\r\nsaid bitterly. “I hired out as a veterinarian, not as a nursemaid for\r\na bunch of psychoneurotic humans and superstitious Lani. The place is\r\njinxed, they tell me.--Ha! Jinxed! Sure it’s jinxed! What job wouldn’t\r\nbe with a bunch of goofballs like these I’ve got working on it.\r\n\r\n“I can’t keep a Lani here for two weeks without having her throw a\r\ncatfit, and the superstitious idiots are affecting the men--who ought to\r\nknow better! I wish I’d never have opened my big mouth to Alexander! As\r\nfar as I’m concerned he can take this job and--”\r\n\r\n“Hey--take it easy, man!” Blalok said. “You’re heading straight for a\r\nnervous breakdown.”\r\n\r\n“And why shouldn’t I?” Kennon asked. “Nothing goes right. There’s always\r\ntrouble. I order materials--they don’t arrive. There’s worker trouble,\r\nequipment trouble, installation trouble. Everybody’s cutting corners,\r\ntrying to get done faster and away sooner--and all they do is mess up\r\nwork that should have been done right the first time. We should have\r\nbeen finished last week, but we have another week to go, at least unless\r\nsome bumble-fingered beanbrain gets another bright idea that sets us\r\nback again. I’m sick to death of it!”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know,” Blalok said soothingly, “and I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry? What good is that? You and Jordan come up here in relays. Just\r\nwhat do you think you’ll find? Or has Alexander dragged you into keeping\r\nan eye on me because I don’t like someone snooping inside my skull?”\r\n\r\n“It’s not that,” Blalok said. “It’s just--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t make excuses. You know and I know the Boss-man is\r\nsuspicious.” Kennon shrugged. “Normally I wouldn’t blame him but it’s\r\na damned nuisance with things the way they are. All we have is one more\r\nbay and a hall to finish--but if--”\r\n\r\n“Now wait a minute,” Blalok said. “Get the kink out of your neck and\r\nsimmer down. Sure--the Boss-man told us to keep an eye on you--but\r\nthat’s not why I’m here this time.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Douglas came back this morning.”\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.” Blalok’s face wore the noncommittal look it always wore\r\nwhen he was taking liberties with the truth.\r\n\r\n“You’re probably the worst liar in the galaxy,” Kennon chuckled. “He’s\r\nhere to breathe down my neck, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\nBlalok nodded.\r\n\r\n“Keep him off my back for another week and he can breathe all he wants\r\nto. I’ll be done then.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t promise a thing.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. “It’s too much to ask, I guess.”\r\n\r\n“But I can try,” Blalok added.\r\n\r\n“That’s enough for me.” Kennon grinned. “Has he turned Alexandria into a\r\nshambles yet?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, but everyone’s uneasy.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t blame them. That young fellow’s undiluted poison. By the way,\r\nhow does he look?”\r\n\r\n“About the same.”\r\n\r\n“The medics must have done a good job,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“The Boss-man shipped him to Beta for treatment,” Blalok said. “He\r\ndidn’t trust the docs out here.”\r\n\r\n“That figures. At any rate Douglas couldn’t have gone to a better\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“What happened to him?”\r\n\r\n“He stuck his nose where he shouldn’t,” Kennon said pointedly.\r\n\r\nBlalok stiffened.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Evald. Even if you knew, I couldn’t talk about it. What I\r\nknow about Douglas is classified!”\r\n\r\n“Well--Douglas is doing plenty of talking. Claims his stay in the\r\nhospital was all your fault.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. “That’s his opinion. And as long as he stays out of my\r\nway he’s welcome to it.”\r\n\r\nBlalok looked at Kennon’s haggard face with mild concern, “Doc,” he\r\nsaid, “you’d better take it easy. You’re going to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be through here in another week, I’ll have this all wrapped up.”\r\n\r\n“Providing you’re not wrapped up first.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“In a shroud. You look like a walking corpse.”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled wearily. “Sometimes I feel like one. But I’d like to get\r\nthis job finished.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll do what I can,” Blalok said. “I’ll try to keep him down at\r\nAlexandria for a few days.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll be enough,” Kennon said. More than enough--he added mentally.\r\nThe coils of fuel wire were ready to load, and the power slugs for the\r\nship’s reactor were already stored in the power plant building here at\r\nOlympus. Three more days and the old spacer would be as ready to fly as\r\nshe would ever be. And after that, it was in the lap of fate.\r\n\r\nHe ushered Blalok to his jeep and watched until he disappeared.\r\n\r\n“I’m getting to be a first-class liar,” he remarked wryly to himself\r\nas he turned back to the temporary quarters he was occupying at the\r\nstation. “And the bad thing about it is that I’m actually enjoying it.”\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago an admission like that would have been inconceivable.\r\nIt was odd, he thought, how one thing led to another and produced an\r\nend that could not be foreseen. Now he could lie and dissemble with the\r\nbest. He had no compunction about falsifying a requisition, or stealing\r\nwhat he could not obtain with apparent honesty. His character had sunk\r\nto an all-time low, he reflected with grim humor as he walked into the\r\nshadow of the main building. Neither Blalok’s nor Jordan’s frequent\r\nvisits bothered him. Both men were creatures of habit and both were\r\nmarried. They stayed home at night--and it was nighttime that he worked\r\non the spacer. The project afforded him a perfect cover and it was only\r\nminutes by jeep away from the crater.\r\n\r\nEven so, the double duty was an appalling task. And it would have been\r\nimpossible if it wasn’t for Copper. Her quick fingers, keen eyesight,\r\nand uncanny memory made the work seem simple, and neither the\r\ntediousness of repairing miles of circuitry nor the depressing\r\nenvironment of Olympus Station seemed to bother her. While he worked\r\nwith the men on the project she restored and reassembled circuits in\r\nhis quarters and at night they replaced them in the old ship. And the\r\nGod-Egg was rapidly becoming operational.\r\n\r\nKennon wondered what it was about Copper that made her so different from\r\nthe rest. Olympus didn’t bother her at all. In fact she seemed to thrive\r\non the depressing atmosphere that filled the Station. Perhaps it was\r\nbecause she had violated the tabu about the God-Egg so often that\r\nordinary superstition had no effect upon her. He shrugged. He had\r\ntroubles enough without worrying about Copper’s motivations, and not the\r\nleast of these was taking the God-Egg into space.\r\n\r\nKennon looked forward to blast-off with distinct misgivings. There was\r\ntoo much about the ancient spacer that was strange--and too much that\r\nwas terrifying.\r\n\r\nBasically the ship was an ion-jet job with atomic primaries and a\r\nspindizzy converter that might possibly take her up as high as middle\r\nyellow Cth--far enough to give her a good turn of speed, but not enough\r\nto compensate for timelag. Her screens were monstrosities, double\r\npolyphase lattices that looked about as spacetight as so many sieves.\r\nThere were no acceleration dampers, no temporal compensators, no\r\nautopilot, no four-space computer, and the primaries operated on nuclear\r\nrather than binding energy. The control chairs weren’t equipped with\r\nforcefields, but instead had incredibly primitive safety webs that held\r\none in place by sheer tensile strength. Taking a ship like that into\r\nspace was an open invitation to suicide. A man needed a combination of\r\nfoolhardy bravery and incredible fatalism to blast off in a can like\r\nthis. He had the stimulus, but the knowledge of what he would face\r\ntroubled him more than he cared to admit. More and more, as he\r\nunderstood the ship, he was amazed at the courage of the ancients who\r\nhad blithely leaped into hyperspace in these flying coffins with no more\r\nmotivation than to see what was beyond the nearest star. And in ships\r\nmore primitive than this men had swept through the star systems nearest\r\nEarth in the outward expansion of the First Millennium.\r\n\r\nHe sighed. The breed of man must have been tough in the old days--and\r\nhe’d soon be finding out if any of that ancient toughness remained.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door to his quarters.\r\n\r\nCopper was sitting in his favorite chair, a pile of completed assemblies\r\nneatly stacked beside her, and a disorderly file of crumpled cloth at\r\nher feet. Her face was sullen as she looked up at him. “I’ve had about\r\nall of this I’m going to take,” she said mutinously as she stirred the\r\nheap of cloth with a bare foot. “Not even you are going to make me wear\r\nthose--things!”\r\n\r\nKennon sighed. It was the same old story. For months he had been trying\r\npatiently to indoctrinate Copper with a minimum of civilized habits, but\r\nshe was quite literally a savage. In her entire lifetime she had never\r\nworn clothing, and to encase her body in hose, kilts, blouse, and\r\nsandals was a form of torture. She scratched, wiggled, and twisted at\r\nthe garments until she looked as bad as she felt, and would usually\r\nfinish a session by tearing off the offending clothes and sulking. She\r\nwas doing it now.\r\n\r\n“You must act like a civilized human being,” Kennon said mildly. “You’re\r\nsimply going to have to learn to wear these clothes properly.”\r\n\r\n“Why? I’m more comfortable as I am.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not the point. You are going to be living in human society and\r\nyou must act human. The only planet where you could get away with nudity\r\nis Santos, and we’re not going there.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve explained it time and again. We’ll have to go to Beta. That’s the\r\nonly place I know where you’ll have a fair hearing. And on Beta people\r\nwear clothes. They have to. It’s cold, even in summer, and in the\r\nwintertime, there’s snow.”\r\n\r\n“What’s snow?”\r\n\r\n“Ice crystals that fall like rain, but I’ve told you this before.”\r\n\r\n“And I still don’t believe it.”\r\n\r\n“Believe it or not you’re going to wear those things. Now put them on!”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with mutiny on her face. “All right, slave driver,”\r\n she muttered as she picked up the clothing, “but I hope you’ll itch\r\nsomeday and be unable to scratch.”\r\n\r\n“And try to wear those garments more gracefully. You make them look like\r\na sack.”\r\n\r\n“They feel like one. I keep thinking that all I need is a tag around my\r\nneck.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t much time to get used to them,” Kennon said. “We’re leaving\r\nthis week.”\r\n\r\n“So soon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--and you’ll wear those things to the ship, into the ship, and all\r\nthe time we’re on the ship. You’ll keep wearing clothing until it looks\r\nright.”\r\n\r\n“Slave driver!” Copper hissed.\r\n\r\n“Slave,” Kennon answered equably.\r\n\r\nCopper giggled. The sound was utterly unexpected, and completely\r\nincongruous. That was the wonder of her, Kennon reflected. Her mercurial\r\ntemperament made life something that was continually exciting She was a\r\nnever-ending delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nIt was the last trip. Kennon loaded the jeep with the last-minute items\r\nhe would need. The four reactor cores in their lead cases went aboard\r\nlast and were packed inside a pile of lead-block shielding.\r\n\r\nHe helped Copper in and looked back without regret as the bulk of\r\nOlympus Station vanished below him in the dusk. The last of the work\r\ncrew had left that afternoon. The station was ready for occupancy.\r\nHis assignment had been completed. He felt an odd pleasure at having\r\nfinished the job. Alexander might not be happy about his subsequent\r\nactions, but he could have no complaint about what he did while he was\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n“Well--say good-bye to Flora,” he said to Copper.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to,” she said. “I don’t want to leave.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t stay. You know that.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded. “But that doesn’t make me any less regretful.”\r\n\r\n“Regretful?”\r\n\r\n“All right--scared. We’re going to try to make the God-Egg fly again.\r\nNot only is it sacrilege, but as you’ve often said, it’s dangerous. I\r\nhave no desire to die.”\r\n\r\n“You have two courses--”\r\n\r\n“I know--you’ve pointed them out often enough,” Copper said. “And since\r\nyou decided to go I’d go with you even though I knew the Egg would blow\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“You’re quite a girl,” Kennon said admiringly. “Did I ever tell you that\r\nI love you?”\r\n\r\n“Not nearly often enough,” Copper said. “You could do it every day and\r\nI’d never get tired of hearing it.”\r\n\r\nThe jeep settled over the lava wall. “We’ll leave it in the passageway\r\nwhen we’re through,” Kennon said. “Maybe it will survive blast-off.”\r\n\r\n“Why worry about it?” Copper asked.\r\n\r\n“I hate destroying anything needlessly,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“And since we have plenty of time, we might as well be neat about our\r\ndeparture.”\r\n\r\nHe was wrong, of course, but he didn’t know that.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nDouglas Alexander checked the radarscope and whistled in surprise at\r\nthe picture it revealed. “So that’s where he’s going,” he said softly\r\nto himself. “Cousin Alex was right as usual.” He grimaced unpleasantly.\r\n“He’s up to something--that’s for sure.” His face twisted into an\r\nexpression that was half sneer, half triumph. “This is going to be\r\nfun.” He moved the control, and his airboat, hovering silently at five\r\nthousand meters, dropped toward the ground in free fall as Douglas\r\nloosened the Burkholtz in the holster at his waist. “But what is he\r\ndoing?” he muttered. The question hung unanswered in the still air of\r\nthe cabin as the airboat dropped downward.\r\n\r\nDouglas hadn’t been impressed with Blalok’s attempt at a delaying\r\naction. Normally he might have been, but his fear of his cousin was\r\ngreater than his respect for Blalok. The superintendent had only\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing something he had not intended when he had\r\ntried to dissuade Douglas from visiting Kennon. He had made Douglas\r\ncautious. The airboat and long-range surveillance had been the result.\r\nFor the past two nights Douglas had hung over Olympus Station, checking\r\nthe place--to leave at dawn when the new day’s work began. For two\r\nnights Kennon had been lucky. He had departed for the Egg shortly before\r\nDouglas took up his station, and had returned after the watcher had\r\ncalled it a night and had returned home. But this last night, Kennon\r\nleft late--and his departure was noted.\r\n\r\n“Wonder who’s the girl with him?” Douglas said as the boat plunged down.\r\n“Well, I’ll be finding out in a minute.”\r\n\r\nKennon’s head jerked upward at the sound of air whistling past the\r\nairboat’s hull, and a wave of icy coldness swept through his chest.\r\nThere was no question that he was discovered. His shoulders sagged.\r\n\r\n“Well--it was a good try,” he said bitterly as Copper looked at him with\r\nsudden terror on her face.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to die,” she wailed.\r\n\r\n“You won’t--not if I can help it,” Kennon said. “Move away from\r\nme--quickly!”\r\n\r\n“But--”\r\n\r\n“Do as I say!” Kennon’s voice was sharp. “And keep that hood over your\r\nface.”\r\n\r\nThe airboat settled softly on the ash in front of him, the door snapped\r\nopen and Douglas dropped to the ground, Burkholtz jutting from his pudgy\r\nfist.\r\n\r\n“My, my,” Douglas said, “what have we here? Dr. Kennon and a woman!\r\nI thought better of you than that, Doctor. And all dressed up in\r\nantiradiation suits. This is interesting. Just what are you doing up\r\nhere on the mountain so late at night--prospecting?”\r\n\r\n“You might call it that,” Kennon said. His body sagged with relief.\r\nDouglas thank Ochsner it was Douglas! He was running true to\r\nform--talking when he should have been shooting.\r\n\r\nDouglas jerked his head toward Copper, standing a few feet to his left.\r\n“Who is she?”\r\n\r\n“None of your business,” Kennon snapped, hoping that his outburst\r\ncovered Copper’s gasp of surprise and fear, and knowing that it didn’t.\r\n\r\n“I’m making it my business. There’s something funny going on around\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nKennon blinked. Could it be that Douglas didn’t know? Had he been\r\nwatching them on radar? Durilium was radar-transparent. It absorbed\r\nand dissipated electromagnetic waves rather than reflecting them. For a\r\nsecond he felt a tiny surge of hope.\r\n\r\n“Stand where you are,” Douglas said as he stepped over to the\r\nhalf-paralyzed Copper and jerked the hood back from her face. For a\r\nmoment he looked puzzled. “Just who are you?” he demanded. “I don’t\r\nrecall seeing you before.” And then recognition dawned. “Old Doc’s\r\nLani!” he gasped.\r\n\r\n“She works for me now,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\nDouglas laughed. It wasn’t a nice sound. “All dressed up?” he asked.\r\n“Nice work.”\r\n\r\n“That’s my fault,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“You know the rules,” Douglas said. “I could blast you both.”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead,” Kennon said, “but if you do, you’ll never find out what\r\nwe’re doing up here.”\r\n\r\nDouglas hesitated. Kennon’s voice was flat and filled with utter\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n“There’s a reason why Copper’s wearing that suit,” Kennon continued,\r\n“and you won’t know that either.”\r\n\r\nThe Burkholtz swiveled around to point at Kennon’s belly. “I’ve had\r\nabout enough of this. Let’s have it. Tell me what you’re doing here!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do better than that,” Kennon said promptly. “I’ll show you. You’ll\r\nbe surprised at what we’ve uncovered.” He made his muscles relax, and\r\nforced himself to speak naturally. Copper, he noted, was still rigid\r\nwith terror. The Alexanders--any of them--were everything he had said\r\nthey were. They were the masters here. And despite Copper’s boast, she\r\nwas as susceptible to their influence as any other Lani.\r\n\r\n“All right,” Douglas said, “show me this thing I’d never be able to\r\nfind without your help.” He half turned to Copper. “Stay where you are,\r\nLani,” he said. “Don’t move until I come back.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Man Douglas,” Copper replied. Her voice was flat, colorless, and\r\nsubmissive.\r\n\r\nKennon shuddered. He had never heard precisely that tone from her\r\nbefore. One word from Douglas and she had become a zombie--a mindless\r\nmuscle preparation that existed only to obey. Anger filled him--anger\r\nthat one he loved could be ordered by someone who wasn’t worth a\r\nthird of her--anger that she obeyed--anger at his own impotence and\r\nfrustration. It wasn’t a clean anger. It was a dark, red-splashed thing\r\nthat struggled and writhed inside him, a fierce unreasoning rage that\r\nseethed and bubbled yet could not break free. For an instant, with\r\nblinding clarity, Kennon understood the feelings of the caged male Lani\r\non Otpen One. And he sympathized.\r\n\r\n“Follow me,” he said and started around the ship.\r\n\r\n“Stay--no--go ahead,” Douglas said, “but remember, I’m right behind\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nKennon walked straight up to the pit and pointed down at the dark bulk\r\nof the Egg., concealed in the shadows of the bottom.\r\n\r\n“That’s it,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What? I don’t see anything,” Douglas said suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“Here--I’ll shine a light.” Kennon reached for his belt.\r\n\r\n“No you don’t! I know that trick. You’re not going to blind me. Take\r\nthat torch loose carefully--that’s it--now hand it to me.” Douglas’ hand\r\nclosed over the smooth plastic. Cautiously he turned on the beam and\r\ndirected it downward.\r\n\r\n“A spacer!” he gasped. “How did that get here?” He leaned forward to\r\nlook into the pit as a dark shadow materialized behind him.\r\n\r\nKennon choked back the involuntary cry of warning that rose in his\r\nthroat. Copper! His muscles tensed as her arm came up and down--a\r\nshadow almost invisible in the starlight. The leaning figure of Douglas\r\ncollapsed like a puppet whose strings had been suddenly released. The\r\ntorch dropped from his hand and went bouncing and winking down the wall\r\nof the pit, followed by Douglas--a limp bundle of arms and legs that\r\nrotated grotesquely as he disappeared down the slope. Starlight gleamed\r\non the Burkholtz lying on the lip of the crater, where it had fallen\r\nfrom his hand.\r\n\r\n“I told you that not even Man Alexander could order me since I gave my\r\nlove to you,” Copper said smugly as she peered over the edge of the pit,\r\na chunk of lava gripped in one small capable hand. “Maybe this proves\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Douglas isn’t Alexander,” Kennon said slowly as he picked up the\r\nblaster, “but I believe you.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I act convincingly?” she said brightly.\r\n\r\n“Very,” he said. “You fooled me completely.”\r\n\r\n“The important thing was that I fooled Douglas.”\r\n\r\n“You did that all right. Now let’s get him out of that pit.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“The jet blast will fry him when we take off.”\r\n\r\n“What difference would that make?”\r\n\r\n“I told you,” Kennon said, “that I never destroy things\r\nunnecessarily--not even things like Douglas.”\r\n\r\n“But he would have destroyed you.”\r\n\r\n“That’s no excuse for murder. Now go back to the jeep and fetch a rope.\r\nI’ll go down and get him out.”\r\n\r\n“Do we have to bother with him?” Copper asked, and then shrugged. It\r\nwas an eloquent gesture expressing disgust, resignation, and unwilling\r\ncompliance in one lift of smoothly muscled shoulders.\r\n\r\n“There’s no question about it,” Kennon said. “You’re becoming more human\r\nevery day.”\r\n\r\nHe chuckled as he slid over the edge of the pit following the path\r\nDouglas had taken a moment before. He found him sitting on a pile of\r\nashes, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“What happened?” Douglas asked querulously. There was fear in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Copper hit you on the head with a rock,” Kennon said as he bent over\r\nand retrieved the torch, still burning near Douglas’ feet.\r\n\r\n“The Lani?” Douglas’ voice was incredulous.\r\n\r\n“Not a Lani,” Kennon corrected. “She’s as human as you or I.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a lie,” Douglas said.\r\n\r\n“Maybe this spacer’s a lie too. Her ancestors came in it--a pair\r\nof humans named Alfred and Melissa Weygand. They were Christian\r\nmissionaries from a planet called Heaven out in Ophiuchus Sector. Went\r\nout to convert aliens and landed here when their fuel ran out.”\r\n Kennon paused. “That was about four millennia ago. Their descendants,\r\nnaturally, reverted to barbarism in a few generations, but there’s\r\nenough evidence in the ship to prove that the Lani were their\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\n“But the tails--the differences--the failure of the test,” Douglas said.\r\n\r\n“Mutation,” Kennon replied. “Those old spindizzy converters weren’t\r\ntoo choosy about how they scattered radiation. And they had come a long\r\nway.” He paused, looking down at Douglas, feeling a twinge of pity for\r\nthe man. His world was crumbling. “And there was no other human blood\r\navailable to filter out their peculiarities. It might have been done\r\nduring the first couple of generations, but constant inbreeding fixed\r\nthe genetic pattern.”\r\n\r\n“How did you discover this?” Douglas asked.\r\n\r\n“Accident,” Kennon said briefly.\r\n\r\n“You’ll never be able to prove they’re human!” Douglas said.\r\n\r\n“The ship’s log will do that.”\r\n\r\n“Not without a humanity test--they can’t pass that.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry to disappoint you. Your grandfather used the wrong sort of sperm.\r\nNow if there had been a Betan in the crew--”\r\n\r\n“You mean she’s pregnant!”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded. “There’s been mutation on Beta,” he said. “And it’s\r\napparently a similar one to hers. Betan-Lani matings are fertile.”\r\n\r\nDouglas’s shoulders sagged, and then straightened. “I don’t believe it,”\r\n he said. “You’re just a damned sneaking spy. Somehow or other you got\r\na spacer in here after you wormed your way into Cousin Alex’s\r\nconfidence--and now you’re going to space out with the nucleus of a new\r\nfarm. Just wait. When Alex learns of this the galaxy’ll be too small to\r\nhold you.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t babble like a fool!” Kennon said with disgust. “How could I land\r\na spacer here without being spotted? You sound like a two-credit novel.\r\nAnd even if I did--would it be a can like this?” Kennon played the torch\r\nover the blue-black durilium protruding from the ashes.\r\n\r\nDouglas’ eyes widened as he took in the details of construction. “What\r\nan antique!” he blurted. “Where did you get this can?”\r\n\r\n“I found it here.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me another one.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t believe,” Kennon said flatly, “because you don’t dare\r\nbelieve. You have a mental block. You’ve killed, maimed, tortured--\r\ntreated them like animals--and now your mind shrinks from admitting\r\nthey’re human. You know what will happen if the old court decision is\r\nreversed. It will wreck your little empire, dry up your money, break\r\nyou--and you can’t stand the thought of that. You don’t dare let us\r\nleave, yet you can’t stop us because I have your blaster and I’d just\r\nas soon shoot you as look at your rotten face. Now get on your feet and\r\nstart climbing if you want to stay alive. We’re getting out of here, and\r\nyou’ll fry inside this pit.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you taking me?”\r\n\r\n“Back to your airboat. I’m going to tie you up and set you off on\r\nautopilot. You’ll be able to get loose quickly enough but it’ll be too\r\nlate to stop us. We’ll be gone, and you can think of how you’ll manage\r\nto face the human race.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you blow yourself and that antique clear out of space.”\r\n\r\n“We might. But you’ll never know for sure. But mark this--if I live I’ll\r\nbe back with the Brotherhood. You can count on it.”\r\n\r\nThey struggled up the side of the pit and halted, panting, on the rim.\r\n“How much radiation was down there?” Douglas asked worriedly.\r\n\r\n“Not enough to hurt you.”\r\n\r\n“That’s good.” Douglas accepted the statement at face value, a fact\r\nwhich failed to surprise Kennon. “You know,” he said, “I’ve been around\r\nLani all my life. And I know that they’re not human. No self-respecting\r\nhuman would take a tenth of what they put up with.”\r\n\r\n“Their ancestors didn’t,” Kennon said. “They fought to the end. But your\r\nGrandfather was a smart man even though he was a Degrader.”\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t!” Douglas exploded. “No Alexander is a Degrader.”\r\n\r\n“He realized,” Kennon went on, “that he’d never succeed in enslaving the\r\nLani unless he separated the sexes. And since women are more subjective\r\nin their outlook--and more pliable--he picked them for his slaves. The\r\nmales he retired to stud. Probably the fact that there were more women\r\nthan men helped him make up his mind.\r\n\r\n“In every society,” Kennon went on inexorably, “there are potential\r\nfreeman and potential slaves. The latter invariably outnumber the\r\nformer. They’re cowards: the timid, the unsacrificing--the ones that\r\nwant peace at any price--the ones who will trade freedom for security.\r\nThose were the ones who hid rather than risk their lives fighting\r\nthe aggressor. Those were the ones who survived. Old Alexander had a\r\nready-made slave cadre when he finished off the last of the warriors.\r\nFor four centuries the survivors have been bred and selected to\r\nperpetuate slave traits. And the system works. The men don’t want\r\nfreedom--they want liberty to kill each other. The women don’t want\r\nfreedom--they want males. And they’d serve them precisely as the Sarkian\r\nwomen serve their menfolk. You’ve killed any chance they had to become\r\na civilization. It’s going to take generations perhaps before they’re\r\nreoriented. There’s plenty you Alexanders should answer for.”\r\n\r\n“If there’s any fault, it’s yours,” Douglas snarled. “We were doing all\r\nright until you came here. We’d still be doing all right if I had shot\r\nyou both.” His shoulders sagged. “I should have killed you when I had\r\nthe chance,” he said bitterly.\r\n\r\n“But you didn’t,” Kennon said, “and to show my gratitude I’m letting you\r\nget away with a whole skin. I don’t expect you to be grateful, but at\r\nleast you’ll not be on my conscience. I don’t enjoy killing, not even\r\nthings like you.”\r\n\r\nDouglas sneered. “You’re soft--a soft sentimental fool.”\r\n\r\n“Admitted,” Kennon said, “but that’s my nature.”\r\n\r\n“Yet you’d destroy the family, wreck Outworld Enterprises, and throw a\r\nwhole world into chaos over a few thousand animals. I don’t understand\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“They’re human,” Kennon said flatly.\r\n\r\n“Admitting they might once have been, they’re not now.”\r\n\r\n“And whose fault is that?”\r\n\r\n“Not ours,” Douglas said promptly. “If there is any fault it’s that of\r\nthe court who decided they were humanoid.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t help any.”\r\n\r\n“Why should we? Does one treat a shrake like a brother?--or a varl?--or\r\na dog? We treat them like the animals they are. And we’ve done no worse\r\nwith the Lani. Our consciences are clear.”\r\n\r\nKennon laughed humorlessly. “Yet this clear conscience makes you want\r\nto kill me, so you can keep on treating them as animals--even though you\r\nknow they’re human.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing of the sort. But you’re right about the killing, I’d\r\nkill you cheerfully if I had the chance. It’s our necks if you get away\r\nwith this. Of course, you probably won’t, but why take the chance. I\r\nlike my neck more than I like yours.”\r\n\r\n“You’re honest at any rate,” Kennon admitted. “And in a way I don’t\r\nblame you. To you it’s probably better to be a rich slaver living off\r\nthe legacy of a Degrader than a penniless humanitarian. But you’ve lost\r\nyour chance.”\r\n\r\nDouglas screamed with rage. He whirled on Kennon, his face a distorted\r\nmask of hate.\r\n\r\n“Hold it!” Kennon barked. “I don’t want to kill you, but I’ll burn a\r\nhole clear through your rotten carcass if you make another move. I have\r\nno love for your kind.”\r\n\r\nDouglas spat contemptuously. “You haven’t got the guts,” he snarled. But\r\nhe didn’t move.\r\n\r\n“Just stand still--very still,” Kennon said softly. The iron in his\r\nvoice was not hidden by the quiet tone.\r\n\r\nDouglas shivered. “I’ll get you yet,” he said, but there was no force in\r\nthe threat.\r\n\r\n“Here’s the rope you wanted,” Copper said as she emerged abruptly from\r\nthe darkness. “I had a hard time finding it.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t been too long,” Kennon said. “Now tie Douglas’ hands behind\r\nhim while I keep him covered.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pleasure,” Copper murmured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n“I’m frightened,” Copper said, twisting uncomfortably in the shock chair\r\nbeside Kennon’s.\r\n\r\n“After you have been so brave?” Kennon asked. “That’s nonsense. It’s\r\njust nervous reaction. Now web in like I showed you. It’s time for\r\nblast-off. We don’t dare wait much longer.”\r\n\r\n“All right--but I have a feeling that this isn’t right. Something is\r\ngoing to go wrong.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you don’t have precognition.” Kennon smiled. “I’ve checked\r\neverything. The ship is as good as she’ll ever be. There’s nothing more\r\nthat we can do.”\r\n\r\n“There’s one consolation,” Copper said wanly. “At we’ll die together.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a better chance that we’ll live together.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so.”\r\n\r\n“Ready?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\nHe flipped the switches that would send the fuel rods into the reactor.\r\nBelow them a soft, barely audible whine ascended the sonic scale to\r\na point of irritating inaudibility. Kennon smiled. The spindizzy was\r\nfunctioning properly. He flipped a second bank of switches and a dull\r\nroar came from the buried stem. Ashes and pumice heated to incandescence\r\nwere blown through the air. Molten drops of radioactive lava skittered\r\nacross the durilium hull as Kennon advanced the power. The whole stem\r\nof the ship was immersed in a seething lake of bolling rock as the Egg\r\nlifted slowly with ponderous dignity into the night sky.\r\n\r\n“Hang on!” Kennon said. “I’m going to hyper.” His hand moved a red lever\r\nand the Egg shimmered and vanished with a peculiar wrenching motion\r\ninto an impossible direction that the mind could not grasp. And the\r\ninterceptor missile from Otpen One nosed through the space the Egg had\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“We made it!” Kennon said, looking across the writhing semifluid control\r\nboard, shifting oddly in the harsh yellow monochromatic light that\r\npervaded the cabin. The screens were leaking like sieves, but they were\r\nholding well enough to keep Cth yellow from being anything more than an\r\nannoyance. He glanced over at Copper, a fantastically elongated Copper\r\nwho looked like a madman’s dream of chaos.\r\n\r\nAnd Copper screamed! The sound echoed and re-echoed, dying away with a\r\nlingering discordant reverberation that made his skin tingle.\r\n\r\n“Copper! It’s all right! It’s all right! Stop it!”\r\n\r\nCopper screamed again and her elongated figure suddenly foreshortened\r\nand collapsed into a small writhing ball from which two small pink hands\r\nemerged clutching at a gelid mass of air that flowed sluggishly around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd Kennon knew what he had forgotten! Hyperspace with leaky screens was\r\nnothing to inflict upon an unprepared mind. It is one thing to endure\r\npartial exposure after months of training, with experienced medics\r\nstanding by to help you through the shock phase, but quite another to\r\nbe thrust from a safe and sheltered existence into the mind shattering\r\ndistortions of the Cth continuum.\r\n\r\nThe Egg was old. Her screens, never good at best, were hardly more than\r\nfilters. Through the hull, through the drive lattice, the viciously\r\ndistorted Cth environment seeped into the ship turning prosaic shapes\r\nof controls and instruments into writhing masses of obscene horror that\r\nsent extensions wiggling off into nothingness at eye-aching angles. A\r\nspaceman could take this--knowing it wasn’t real--but a tyro could not.\r\n\r\nCopper collapsed. Her mind, assaulted by sensations no untrained person\r\nshould experience, went into shock. But she wasn’t granted the mercy\r\nof unconsciousness. Terrified by a pseudo reality that surpassed her\r\nwildest nightmares, she stared wide-eyed at the control room and the\r\nthing that had been Kennon. She screamed until her throat was raw,\r\nuntil the monster beside her touched her with Kennon’s hands. Then,\r\nmercifully, she felt a stinging in her arm and all sensation ceased.\r\n\r\nKennon stared glumly at the controls. Fleming alone knew how many\r\nobjective years were passing outside as they hurtled through four-space.\r\nSubjectively it would only be hours aboard the Egg, but a decade--or\r\nmaybe a century--might pass outside this mad universe where neither time\r\nnor speed had meaning. The old ships didn’t have temporal compensators,\r\nnor could they travel through upper bands of Cth where subjective\r\nand objective time were more nearly equal. They were trapped in\r\na semi-stasis of time as the ship fled on through the distorted\r\nmonochromatic regions that bypassed normal space.\r\n\r\nThe Egg slipped smoothly out of the hyper jump, back into the normal\r\nuniverse. Beta floated above them, the blue shield of her atmosphere\r\nshining softly in the light of Beta’s sun.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t hit it that good again in a hundred tries,” Kennon gloated.\r\n“Halfway across the galaxy--and right on the nose.” He looked at the\r\nshock chair beside him. Copper was curled into a tight ball inside the\r\nconfining safety web, knees drawn up, back bent, head down--arms wrapped\r\nprotectingly around her legs--the fetal position of catatonic shock.\r\n\r\nHe shook her shoulder--no response. Her pulse was thready and irregular.\r\nHer breathing was shallow. Her lips were blue. Her condition was\r\nobvious--space shock--extreme grade. She’d need medical attention if she\r\nwas going to live. And she’d need it fast!\r\n\r\n“Just why, you educated nitwit,” he snarled at himself, “didn’t you have\r\nsense enough to give her that injection of Sonmol before we hypered! You\r\nhaven’t the sense of a decerebrate Capellan grackle!”\r\n\r\nHe turned on the radio. “Emergency!” he said. “Any station! Space-shock\r\ncase aboard. Extreme urgency.”\r\n\r\n“Identify yourself--give your license. Over.”\r\n\r\n“What port are you?”\r\n\r\n“Hunterstown--will you please identify? Over.”\r\n\r\n“Your co-ordinates,” Kennon snapped. “Over.”\r\n\r\n“280.45--67.29 plus. Repeat--request your identification.”\r\n\r\n“Pilot Kennon, Jac, Beta 47M 26429. I have no I.D. for the ship--and\r\nyou’ll see why when I land. Over.”\r\n\r\n“Hunterstown Port to Kennon. You are not--repeat not--cleared to land.\r\nGo into orbit and report your position. Over.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry, Hunterstown. You wouldn’t have checked in if you didn’t have\r\nroom, and a hospital. This is an emergency. I’m setting down. Out.”\r\n\r\n“But--” The words got no farther. Kennon was already spinning the ship.\r\n\r\n“All right--we have you on the scope. But this is a class one violation.\r\nYou may come in on Landing Beam One.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry. I have no GCA.”\r\n\r\n“What?--what sort of ship are you flying?” The voice was curious.\r\n\r\n“I’m matching intrinsics over your port. Talk me in when I break through\r\nthe overcast.”\r\n\r\n“Talk you in?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. My instruments are obsolete.”\r\n\r\n“Great Halstead! What else?”\r\n\r\n“I have an Ion drive. Plus two radioactive.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no!--And you still want to come in?”\r\n\r\n“I have to. My passenger’s in shock. She’s going to have a baby.”\r\n\r\n“All right--I’ll try to get you down in one piece.”\r\n\r\n“Have an ambulance ready,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\nKennon lowered the Egg through the overcast. Ground control picked him\r\nup smoothly and took him down as though it had been rehearsed. The Egg\r\ntouched down in the radioactive area of the port. Decontamination jets\r\nhissed, sluicing the ship to remove surface contamination.\r\n\r\n“Ochsner! what sort of a ship is that?” Ground Control’s startled voice\r\ncame over the annunciator.\r\n\r\n“It’s an old one,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“That’s a gross understatement. Stand by for boarders. Ambulance coming\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nKennon opened the airlock and two radiation-suited men entered. “At\r\nleast you had sense enough to wear protective clothing in this hotbox,”\r\n one said as they carefully unwebbed Copper and carried her out of the\r\nlock. “You wait here. The Port Captain wants to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you taking her? What Center?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“What should you care? You’ve nearly killed her. The idea of taking\r\na pregnant woman up in this death trap! What in Fleming’s name’s the\r\nmatter with your brain?”\r\n\r\n“I had to,” Kennon said. “I had to. It was a matter of life and death.”\r\n For once, he thought wryly, the cliche was true.\r\n\r\nThe Betan’s face behind the transparent helmet was disgusted and\r\nunbelieving. “I hear that sort of thing every day,” he said. “Am I\r\nsupposed to believe it?”\r\n\r\n“You’d believe it if you’d have been where I was,” Kennon muttered.\r\n“Now--whe’re are you taking her?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe man arched blond eyebrows. “To the local Medical Center--where else?\r\nThere’s only one in this area.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\nHe watched the ambulance flit off as he waited for the Spaceport Patrol.\r\nThere was no further need for the protection suit, so he peeled it off\r\nand hung it in the control-room locker. Copper was right, he mused. It\r\ndid itch.\r\n\r\nThe Port Captain’s men were late as usual--moving gingerly through the\r\nradiation area. A noncom gestured for him to enter their carryall. “Port\r\nCaptain wants to see you,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I know,” Kennon replied.\r\n\r\n“You should have waited upstairs.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t. It was a matter of medicine,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\nThe noncom’s face sobered. “Why didn’t you say so? All you said was that\r\nit was an emergency.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been away. I forgot.”\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t have done that. You’re a Betan, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded.\r\n\r\nThey drove to the Port Office, where Kennon expected--and got--a bad\r\ntime from the port officials. He filled out numerous forms, signed\r\naffidavits, explained his unauthorized landing, showed his spaceman’s\r\nticket, defended his act of piloting without an up-to-date license,\r\nsigned more forms, entered a claim for salvage rights to the Egg, and\r\nfinally when the Legal Division, the Traffic Control Division, the\r\nSpaceport Safety Office, Customs, Immigration, and Travelers Aid had\r\nfinished with him, he was ushered into the presence of the Port Captain.\r\n\r\nThe red-faced chunky officer eyed him with a cold stare. “You’ll be\r\nlucky, young man, if you get out of this with a year in Correction. Your\r\nstory doesn’t hang together.”\r\n\r\nIt didn’t, Kennon thought. But there was no sense telling all of it to\r\na Port Captain. Under no circumstances could the man be any help to him.\r\nHe had neither the power nor the prestige to request a Brotherhood Board\r\nof Inquiry. In rank, he was hardly more than a glorified Traffic Control\r\nofficer. It would do no good to tell him an improbable tale of slavery\r\non a distant planet. The only thing to do was wait out the storm and\r\nhope it would pass. If worst came to worst he’d use his rank, but he’d\r\nmade enough stir already. He doubted if the Captain had authority to\r\norder him into Detention--but he was certain to get a lecture. These\r\nminor officials loved to tell someone off. He gritted his teeth. He’d\r\nendure it for Copper’s sake--and to get out of here quietly. Alexander\r\nwould undoubtedly have agents posted by now, and his only chance for\r\ntemporary freedom of action was to get out of here with as little fuss\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nHe sat quietly, his flushed face and tight jaw muscles betraying his\r\nimpatience as the Captain paced up and down and talked on and on. The\r\nman sounded like he could go for hours. With increasing impatience\r\nKennon listened to the cadenced flow of complaint and condemnation,\r\noccasionally inserting a “Yes, sir” or “Sorry, sir” or “No, sir” as the\r\nwords flowed around him.\r\n\r\nHowever, there had to be a breaking point somewhere, and the monotony\r\nwas beginning to wear his temper thin. Another five minutes, he\r\nreflected, was about all he could take.\r\n\r\nThe door chime rang softly.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” the Port Captain said, breaking off in mid-tirade. The change\r\nin his manner was so abrupt that Kennon couldn’t help smiling.\r\n\r\nA young blond man in an interne’s gray uniform entered the room.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Doctor,” the Port Captain said. “What can I do for you?”\r\n\r\n“Do you have a Jac Kennon here? Dr. Jac Kennon?”\r\n\r\n“Did you say doctor?” the Port Captain said in a half-strangled voice.\r\n\r\n“You never let me tell you,” Kennon said mildly, “that my landing here\r\nwas a matter of medicine. Technically you have contributed to a delay in\r\ntreatment.”\r\n\r\nThe Port Captain’s face paled. “Why didn’t you say something?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Against your gale of wind I would be but a faint breeze,” Kennon said\r\ncoldly. He turned to the interne. “I’m Dr. Kennon.” They bowed formally\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\n“I’m Smalley, sir, from the medical center. Dr. Brainard sends his\r\ncompliments and requests that you join him for consultation.”\r\n\r\n“The Port Captain--” Kennon began.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry about it, Doctor. I’ll relinquish responsibility to Dr.\r\nBrainard,” the Captain said.\r\n\r\n“I have placed a formal written request with your office,” Smalley said\r\nstiffly. “You are relieved of further charge. Dr. Kennon is urgently\r\nneeded. It is a matter of medicine.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked relieved. On Beta it was poor policy to interfere\r\nwith the doings of doctors and engineers--or even doctors of philosophy.\r\n\r\n“Very well. He’s yours--and I’m glad to be rid of him.” The Port Captain\r\nbowed to Kennon and Smalley and stalked out of the office.\r\n\r\n“Pompous little man,” Kennon observed, “but he certainly can talk.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--you know these Administrative people,” the interne said\r\ndepreciatingly. “One mustn’t mind them. They’re necessary nuisances.”\r\n He eyed Kennon curiously. “How is it that you didn’t stand on your\r\nprofessional rights?”\r\n\r\n“I have my reasons--but they have nothing to do with medicine.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--I see. Ethical.” The interne’s voice was faintly sarcastic.\r\n\r\n“Manners, Doctor--manners.” Kennon’s voice was gentle but the interne\r\nflushed a dull red.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it. It’s normal for a graduate to confuse liberty with\r\nlicense.” Kennon smiled. “Don’t worry. I shan’t report you.”\r\n\r\n“That’s good of you, sir.” Smalley’s face registered relief. Demerits\r\nwere difficult to erase--particularly ones of courtesy.\r\n\r\nKennon wondered if the young man would report himself. He doubted it.\r\nThe interne didn’t look the type--probably he was dated for some obscure\r\njob, like a general practitioner. He shrugged. It took all kinds to make\r\na profession. Even the Smalleys had their place.\r\n\r\n“That girl you brought in,” Smalley said as they entered a white\r\ncar emblazoned with the three crosses, red, blue, and green, that\r\nrepresented the three fields of medicine. “She’s an interesting case.\r\nI’ve never seen space shock before. And the patient herself--one would\r\nhardly believe she was a Betan.”\r\n\r\n“She isn’t,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“So?” Blond eyebrows rose in inverted U’s of surprise. “But that’s\r\nhardly possible. Our tests indicate-”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think that this is a matter for Dr. Brainard?” Kennon said\r\nicily. “Protocol--”\r\n\r\n“Of course. Stupid of me--but the case is so interesting. Half the\r\ncenter staff have seen her already. I wasn’t proposing to discuss the\r\ncase. It wouldn’t be proper. Even though you are only a veterinarian.”\r\n\r\n“Only?” Kennon’s voice was hard. “I shouldn’t have to remind you of\r\nthis, Mr. Smalley--but I have been for the past two years on a world of\r\nbad manners. I expected better here at home.”\r\n\r\nSmalley flushed to the roots of his straw-colored hair. “Sorry, Doctor,”\r\n he muttered. “I don’t know what’s the matter with me.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you,” Kennon said. “You’ve just graduated.”\r\n\r\n“How did you know?” Smalley said.\r\n\r\n“I was a graduate once, myself--not too long ago.”\r\n\r\n“How long, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Class of Eighty-seven.”\r\n\r\n“That’s twelve years ago,” Smalley said.\r\n\r\nKennon nodded. Ten years lost. Not bad--not bad at all. But Alexander\r\ncould have done a lot in ten years.\r\n\r\n“I meant no disrespect,” Smalley said worriedly.\r\n\r\n“I know it. But if you intend to practice on Beta, you’d better\r\npolish your professional manner. Now where I was, it didn’t make much\r\ndifference. Laymen often called me ‘Doc.’”\r\n\r\nSmalley was properly shocked. “I hope you didn’t encourage them, sir.”\r\n\r\n“It was impossible to discourage them,” Kennon said. “After all, when\r\nthe man who hires you--”\r\n\r\n“Oh--entrepreneurs,” Smalley said in a tone that explained everything.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe car stopped in front of the Medical Center’s staff entrance. “This\r\nway, sir,” Smalley said. He led the way down a green-tiled corridor\r\nto an elevator--then down another corridor past a pair of soft-footed\r\nnurses who eyed them curiously--looking at Kennon’s tunic and sandals\r\nwith mild disapproval in their eyes. Smalley stopped and knocked softly\r\non a closed door.\r\n\r\n“Enter,” said a pleasant baritone voice from the annunciator.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Brainard--Dr. Kennon,” Smalley said.\r\n\r\nKennon liked the man instantly. A plump, pink-cheeked man of middle\r\nage, with prematurely white hair, Dr. Will Brainard combined a fatherly\r\nappearance with an impression of quick intelligence. The fat that\r\nsheathed his stocky body had obviously not touched his mind. Brainard\r\nrose from the deep chair near the window where he had been sitting,\r\nknocked the ashes from his pipe, and bowed stiffly. His eyes--sharp\r\npoints of blue in the smooth pinkness of his face--surveyed Kennon\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n“So you’re the young man who takes untrained pregnant women for rides in\r\nold-fashioned spacers,” he said. “Didn’t you know what would happen?”\r\n\r\n“I was in a hurry, Doctor,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“Obviously. Now tell me about it.” Brainard looked at the eager-faced\r\ninterne standing behind Kennon. “That will be all, Smalley,” he said.\r\n\r\nKennon waited until the door closed. “Ordinarily,” he said, “I’d never\r\nhave done a thing like that, but there were some very pressing reasons.\r\nHowever, I should have given her an injection of Somnol before we\r\nstarted. I’m criminally liable. If anything happens to her--” His voice\r\nwas tight with worry.\r\n\r\n“You’d give her an injection?” Brainard said. “I hope you didn’t mean\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“But I did, sir. I’ve given thousands of Lani injections.”\r\n\r\n“What’s a Lani?”\r\n\r\n“She is, sir. The impression has been that her race isn’t human.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense--it’s obvious she is.”\r\n\r\n“A Brotherhood Court of Inquiry didn’t think so.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm. Is that so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.--But before I go on, tell me, how is she?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she’ll be fine. A little mental therapy and plenty of rest are all\r\nshe needs. She’s a remarkably healthy young woman. But this is beside\r\nthe point. There are a number of unusual features about this case that\r\nneed investigation.” Brainard took a standard hospital form from his\r\ndesk. “Mind if I ask you some questions, Doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all but you are due for some unpleasant shocks as you go through\r\nthat form.”\r\n\r\n“I believe I can survive them,” Brainard said dryly.\r\n\r\n“This is professional confidence--” Kennon began.\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course,” Brainard said impatiently. “Now let’s get on\r\nwith it.”\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“This is the most amazing tale I’ve ever heard,” Brainard said slowly.\r\n“Are you certain you are telling the truth?”\r\n\r\nKennon grinned. “I don’t blame you for not believing me--but the\r\nevidence is conclusive, and there is enough documentary evidence in\r\nthe space ship--and in the fact of the ship itself to prove what I am\r\nsaying. Laboratory tests here will establish the fact that Copper’s\r\nchild is also mine. And as for Flora, a Brotherhood Investigation Team\r\ncan prove that part.”\r\n\r\n“That will be attended to,” Brainard said grimly.\r\n\r\n“But how did you deduce she wasn’t from a Betan colony?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\nBrainard smiled. “That wasn’t hard. Her sun tan and the condition of her\r\nfeet proved she was a practicing nudist. No Betan girl ever practices\r\nnudism to my knowledge. Besides, the I.D. tattoo under her left arm and\r\nthe V on her hip are no marks of our culture. Then there was another\r\nthing--the serological analysis revealed no gerontal antibodies. She\r\nhad never received an injection of longevity compound in her life. This\r\nmight occur, but it’s highly improbable. The evidence indicates that\r\nshe’s extra-Betan.”\r\n\r\nKennon nodded.\r\n\r\n“But this business of her being fifteen years old! That’s impossible.\r\nShe has the development of a woman of twenty-five.”\r\n\r\n“Remember the Alpha V colony?” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Of course--oh--I see! It could be something like that.\r\nCertainly--strong yellow G-type sun--an isolated colony serviced at\r\ntwenty-year intervals--there was a marked physical precocity.”\r\n\r\n“And if this had been continued for several millennia?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Hmm--I see. Yes, it’s possible. On Alpha V the colonists grew from\r\ninfancy to maturity in fifteen years.”\r\n\r\n“And wasn’t Heaven one of our early colonies?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--it was established after the Great Schism near the end of the\r\nFirst Millennium--when science and religion split irrevocably on this\r\nworld. We packed the whole lot of them off to a world of their own where\r\nthey could develop as they pleased. They called it Heaven--odd name for\r\na fogworld--but there’s no accounting for tastes.” Brainard chuckled.\r\n\r\n“I thought that was the case, but I couldn’t remember. My ancient\r\nhistory is pretty weak.”\r\n\r\n“You should read more,” Brainard said. “But as I see it--this girl is of\r\nBetan ancestry providing your theory and the facts coincide.”\r\n\r\n“Which could also explain why an outworld species of agerone would be\r\ntoxic. They tried to prolong Lani life and met with failure. Our plants\r\nare mutant forms.”\r\n\r\n“Just as we are a mutant race,” Brainard said, “or partly mutant.” He\r\nsighed. “You have brought us a great deal of trouble, Kennon. You are\r\nbringing matters to a head. If our investigations prove your statements,\r\nwe are morally bound to open the Lani question. And if those people are\r\nof Betan origin--that fellow Alexander will have plenty to answer for.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it is really his fault,” Kennon said slowly. “I don’t\r\nthink he has ever known the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you tell him?”\r\n\r\n“The answer to that should be obvious. Even though I trusted him\r\ncompletely, I could never be sure. He has a Free Trader background\r\nand those people can’t he trusted where money’s concerned. The whole\r\nKardonian culture is an outgrowth of Free Traderism: small business,\r\nindependent corporation, linear trusts, and all the cutthroat\r\ncompetition such a culture would naturally have. It’s a regular jungle\r\nof Free Enterprise. I couldn’t predict how he would react. He could\r\neither act in a moral manner and make restitution, or he could quietly\r\ncut our throats and go on with his business.”\r\n\r\n“I see. The temptation to cut a throat might be overwhelming.”\r\n\r\n“They fight commercial wars,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“Disgusting--utterly uncivilized! Under the circumstances you had no\r\nother course. Still, they have no moral right to enslave human beings.”\r\n\r\n“There is always the element of doubt. Maybe they didn’t know. After\r\nall, an impartial court declared the Lani alien--and the Betan mutation\r\nisn’t known throughout the Brotherhood.”\r\n\r\n“One doesn’t go around broadcasting data on the variations of one’s germ\r\nplasm,” Brainard said. “That’s a private affair--a matter of personal\r\nprivacy.”\r\n\r\n“And public safety?”\r\n\r\nBrainard nodded. “We’re no more courageous than any other civilization.\r\nWe have no desire to borrow trouble. We are content to leave things\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the trouble,” Kennon said. “We’re all content to leave things\r\nalone. If I hadn’t found the spaceship I’d not have been able to lay\r\naside my moral conditioning. And if I had not, Copper would not have\r\nbecome pregnant and forced me into these drastic actions. It’s even\r\npossible that I would have done nothing.” He grimaced. “And when I left\r\nAlexander’s employment mnemonic erasure would have removed all memory of\r\nthe Lani’s human origin.” He shrugged. “I still am not certain that it\r\nwouldn’t have been the wiser course. Naturally, once I knew, I couldn’t\r\ndo anything else than what I did.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally,” Brainard said. “Humanity reaches the heights when it faces\r\nquestions of moral responsibility.”\r\n\r\n“To mankind,” Kennon added heavily. “We have a convenient blind spot\r\nregarding our moral responsibility to other intelligent races.”\r\n\r\n“A harsh fact, but true--and who is to judge whether it is right or\r\nwrong? We achieved dominance of Earth by our moral responsibility to\r\nfamily, tribe, and nation--and we nearly exterminated ourselves when\r\nwe forgot that this responsibility went beyond nations and embraced\r\nall mankind. We learned that after the Exodus. As for the other\r\nraces--perhaps someday we will learn moral responsibility for all\r\nintelligence--but we are not ready for that yet. That’s too big a mental\r\nhurdle.” Brainard sighed. “We are what we are, and we change slowly. But\r\nwe change.”\r\n\r\n“True enough,” Kennon said. “But it’s hard to be philosophical about\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“You’re young. Live a couple of centuries and you will understand\r\npatience.”\r\n\r\nKennon smiled.\r\n\r\n“You know,” Brainard said thoughtfully, “you still have plenty of things\r\nto do.”\r\n\r\n“I know. I’ll have to make a transcript of this discussion, have\r\nit witnessed, and make a sealed record. I have to arrange for the\r\nreposition of the evidence inside the Egg, and a complete recording of\r\nthe Egg itself.”\r\n\r\n“And to be safe you’ll need several facsimiles, properly attested. The\r\narms of these outworld entrepreneurs are long, and unfortunately not all\r\nBetans are models of honesty.”\r\n\r\n“I’d better get started then.”\r\n\r\n“Let me help you,” Brainard said. “I have a little influence in this\r\narea--and your cause interests me.” He picked up the phone on his desk.\r\n\r\nKennon sighed. He had found an ally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do with that girl?” Brainard asked.\r\n\r\n“Formalize our mating as soon as she is able to get out of bed,” Kennon\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“She is an ignorant, untrained savage!” Brainard protested. “You should\r\nhear the stories the nurses tell about her!”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled. “You don’t have to tell me about those. I’ve lived with\r\nLani for two years. But she’s not stupid.”\r\n\r\n“What are your plans?”\r\n\r\n“After we establish her humanity legally,” Kennon said, “I’m going to\r\nsend her to school.”\r\n\r\n“For twenty years?”\r\n\r\n“If necessary. But I don’t think it will take that long. She has some\r\nschooling.”\r\n\r\n“But no training--and what of the Lani in the meantime?”\r\n\r\n“I have plans for that. I’m going back to Kardon and give Alexander a\r\nchance to make restitution. I think he is an honorable man. Slavery may\r\nbe as revolting to him as it is to any civilized human. He deserves a\r\nchance to rectify his grandfather’s error.”\r\n\r\n“That is reasonable--and in the best traditions of the Brotherhood.”\r\n\r\n“Furthermore, it’s practical,” Kennon said. “Alexander is the only one\r\nfully qualified to handle the problems of enfranchisement. He’s known\r\nthe Lani all his life, and he is an executive type. A Brotherhood\r\ncommittee would probably botch the whole affair. What with colonial\r\njurisdiction, territorial rights, and all the legal quibbling that\r\ncommittees love, the Lani would get a poor deal. And there’s no reason\r\nto wreck the lives of a couple of hundred million Kardonians because\r\nthe rightful owners of Kardon were illegally enslaved. That happened\r\ntoo long ago to have any practical meaning. There are other and better\r\nsolutions.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“How should I know?” Kennon asked. “But I’m sure Alexander will. That’s\r\nhis field.”\r\n\r\n“All you have to worry about is whether he’ll co-operate,” Brainard\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“He’ll co-operate once he knows the score,” Kennon said confidently.\r\n“And he’ll have to make some form of restitution. But it shouldn’t\r\ninvolve Kardon. Actually the Lani were never in a position to develop\r\nthat world. They’d probably have remained on Flora indefinitely. The old\r\ncourt records showed no tendency for their culture to expand. They\r\nwere an inbred group, a static, balanced society in harmony with their\r\nenvironment. In nearly thirty-five hundred years their numbers increased\r\nonly to a few thousand. Actually there is a good possibility that the\r\nrace would ultimately have died out if Old Alexander hadn’t enslaved\r\nthem and instituted a controlled breeding program. There are more Lani\r\nalive today than there were at the height of their power. So in a way\r\nOld Alexander did them a favor. He kept their race alive. All we can\r\nexpect is a fair and just settlement.”\r\n\r\n“But if Alexander doesn’t co-operate?”\r\n\r\n“That’s where you come in. You’ll be a watchdog. If you don’t receive\r\nannual progress reports from me--and see or talk to me personally every\r\nsecond year, you are released from our bond and can do what you wish\r\nwith the evidence I’ve accumulated.”\r\n\r\n“We’d better get this into Private Record,” Brainard said. “We can\r\ntranscribe an agreement and place it in the Public Repository.”\r\n\r\n“A good idea and we’d better waste no time. Alexander might still be\r\nlooking for me--and if he is, it’s merely a question of time before he\r\ncatches up.”\r\n\r\n“Ten years have passed. It’s doubtful. But we could keep you here at the\r\nCenter.”\r\n\r\nKennon shook his head. “Too dangerous. And besides it would compromise\r\nyou. No--we’ll get everything possible done to make the Lani’s case\r\nairtight, and then I’ll return to Kardon. It will put our case in\r\na better light if it ever comes to trial, if I go back voluntarily.\r\nAnyway--I’m morally bound to return. Now let’s make this record.”\r\n\r\n“It’s your decision,” Brainard said. “And it’s your neck--but I must\r\nadmit that I agree with you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll feel safer when we get the legal details clarified,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“And what of the girl?”\r\n\r\n“Can you take care of her if I have to leave quickly?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. I’ll give her personal attention, and after she has her\r\nchild I’ll see that she is sent to you.”\r\n\r\n“That’s decent of you, Doctor.”\r\n\r\n“It’s my moral responsibility,” Brainard said as he slipped a new tape\r\ninto the recorder.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nCopper responded quickly to rest and therapy. The space shock cleared up\r\nquickly. The gerontological treatments put her to bed again, but within\r\na month she was completely normal, and her lifespan was now that of a\r\nnormal human. She could look forward to some four hundred years with\r\nKennon--and the prospect was not unpleasant. The Center fascinated her.\r\nNever before had she seen a hospital devoted to the care and\r\ntreatment of humans. It was a far cry, in its polished steel and stone\r\nmagnificence, from the tiny primitive structure over which Kennon had\r\npresided. Yet both places served the same purpose. Perhaps Kennon was\r\nright--that there was no difference between man and Lani. The idea was\r\nnot nearly as unbelievable as it was at first.\r\n\r\n“I never realized what it meant to be human,” Copper said as she held\r\nKennon’s hand. “It is nice to feel important and to know that our child\r\nis a member of the race that rules the galaxy.”\r\n\r\n“So you’re convinced?” Kennon chuckled.\r\n\r\n“The serological identity--” she began.\r\n\r\n“Hmm. You’ve been getting some education, I see.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” Copper smiled, “I didn’t think you wanted a stupid woman. I can\r\nread--and since you are around so seldom nowadays, there is little else\r\nto do. I’ve been reading history, medicine, and novels,” she finished\r\nproudly.\r\n\r\n“A fine catholic selection,” Kennon said, “Now if you add mathematics,\r\nsociology, and philosophy you’ll have a well-rounded basic education.”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Brainard has been trying something he calls ‘hypno.’ He says it\r\nwill help me learn faster. But I can’t see that it’s done much good.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t until you need the information,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“That technique is only good for implanting basic knowledge, and much of\r\nthat will merely supplement or complete that which you already have. You\r\nwon’t be conscious of it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--I think I see what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, you’ll have to continue your formal education. There’s a\r\ngreat deal for you to learn. It should keep you busy while I’m away.”\r\n\r\n“Away? Where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Back to Kardon.”\r\n\r\n“But you can’t! Alexander will destroy you.”\r\n\r\n“I think not. After all, ten years have elapsed since we left there and\r\nhe’s had plenty of time to think. Douglas must have told him about us.\r\nI wouldn’t be surprised if he has already done something about your\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nShe shivered. “He might--but the question is what would he do? He could\r\nhave killed them all!”\r\n\r\nKennon shook his head. “I don’t think so. He never struck me as a mass\r\nmurderer.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “You don’t know the Alexanders like I do. I was\r\nraised by them. They’re capable of anything. But what is this business\r\nof ten years? That’s silly. I haven’t had my child yet--and it doesn’t\r\ntake ten years of pregnancy to produce a baby.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the difference between subjective and objective time,” Kennon\r\nsaid. “We traveled here through hyperspace--low Cth--in an uncompensated\r\nship, and there is little temporal flow in the levels below the blue.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--of course.”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled. “That would have been Greek to you a couple of weeks\r\nago. See where that basic data fits?”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve always known that.”\r\n\r\n“You just think you have. Search your memory and see if I’m not right.”\r\n\r\nCopper shook her head. “It’s very strange,” she said. “But that’s not\r\nimportant. This idea of going back to Kardon, though--that’s a different\r\nthing--that is important.”\r\n\r\n“I have to do it. Not only because it’s a personal moral obligation but\r\nalso because of the Lani. They must have their freedom.”\r\n\r\n“Providing there are any still alive.”\r\n\r\n“Stop being a calamity howler. Whatever Alexander may be, he’s not a\r\nbutcher. He even loved a Lani once. You told me so yourself. And he\r\ncouldn’t kill where he loved.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded. “I suppose you’re right, but I’ve never lost my fear of the\r\nMan Alexander. He held the power of life and death over me. But if you\r\nmust go then I should go too. My obligation is greater than yours.”\r\n\r\n“Later,” Kennon said. “You’re not ready to return. It will be time\r\nenough after you have learned some civilized habits.”\r\n\r\nCopper’s face lengthened. “You mean like wrapping myself in cloth like\r\nthese people do?”\r\n\r\n“That’s part of it.”\r\n\r\n“Why can’t they be sensible--or are they so ashamed of what the gods\r\ngave them that they must hide themselves?”\r\n\r\n“No, it’s not that. At least not exactly. It’s custom. And you must\r\nlearn to conform to customs--outwardly at least--no matter what you may\r\nreally think.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that a form of lying?” Copper asked.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that strange. Your society exalts truth, honor, morality, and\r\nintelligence--yet you lie about your attitude.”\r\n\r\n“It’s called diplomacy,” Kennon said. “It’s part of respect for others’\r\nattitudes and beliefs, a necessary part of human relationships.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’d be a nudist on Santos?”\r\n\r\n“Of course--even though I think it isn’t proper, I couldn’t inflict my\r\nideas and attitudes on the customs of an independent world.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--you think I’m doing that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--and it is a mark of barbarism.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes you’re not very nice,” Copper said.\r\n\r\nKennon smiled wryly. “I suppose I’m not,” he agreed.\r\n\r\n“I’ll try to be civilized,” Copper said. “But if you go to Kardon--I’m\r\ngoing with you.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” Kennon said. “We’ll see how things turn out.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t want me to go with you?”\r\n\r\n“To be honest--no,” Kennon said. “You’re safe here, and until your\r\nstatus is cleared by a Brotherhood court, I wouldn’t care to place you\r\nin Alexander’s hands. And clearing your status is going to take time.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that I am still his property?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But there is a legal doubt that will prevent him from exercising\r\nhis claim as long as you stay on Beta. In the area where he has power,\r\nthat doubt might not hold. So until your status is definitely proven to\r\nbe human, you should not leave.”\r\n\r\n“And what happens if this court denies my claim?”\r\n\r\n“Then we appeal to the Council. However, with the evidence we have, your\r\nclaim cannot reasonably be denied. The only question is one of time. It\r\nmay take years. Still, I don’t think there is anything to worry about. I\r\ndon’t think Alexander will give us any trouble, but there’s no sense in\r\ntaking chances.”\r\n\r\n“You still think I’m a Lani,” she said accusingly.\r\n\r\n“I do not.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think that I’d obey Alexander, after what I did to Douglas.”\r\n\r\n“I can only repeat that Douglas isn’t the Boss-man.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I knew what you really thought.”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t hard. I think you should stay here until I get this business\r\nstraightened out.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all?” she asked suspiciously. “After all, I know I’m not very\r\npretty now. And there’s lots of Lani on Flora--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, for Ochsner’s sake! Do you think that I’m--” He paused, speechless.\r\n“Just what do you think I am?”\r\n\r\n“You’re a man. And that’s the trouble.”\r\n\r\nKennon chuckled. “So that’s it! You don’t trust me.”\r\n\r\n“I love you,” Copper said.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I wonder why men ever finalize their status with women,”\r\n Kennon murmured. “It does no good. It doesn’t convince the woman. She’s\r\nstill fearful, jealous, and suspicious--always belittling her ability\r\nto hold what she has, always alert for competition, clinging, holding,\r\nabsorbing--when she should be working as part of a team.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not true!”\r\n\r\n“Then prove it.”\r\n\r\n“How--by staying here while you go to the end of the galaxy and play\r\nnoble?”\r\n\r\n“I’m only doing what I have to do.”\r\n\r\n“And so am I--and if you go I’m going with you.”\r\n\r\nKennon shrugged. There was no sense arguing. The only thing to do was\r\nmake his plans and leave quietly. If she was faced with an established\r\nfact, she might be more reasonable. He doubted it, but alone, she could\r\ndo nothing--and Brainard would see that she was comfortable. The salvage\r\nmoney from the Egg would keep her from being a public charge. And he had\r\nmore banked in Albertsville which he could send her once he got there.\r\nHe’d start making plans to leave as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nCopper looked up at him as he stood above her bed. Slowly she reached\r\nout and placed one slim hand in his. “I know what you are thinking,” she\r\nsaid, “and--” her face twisted in a grimace of pain, and the hand in his\r\nclutched with convulsive strength at his fingers.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Nothing--it’s perfectly normal,” she said. “I’m just going to give you\r\na son. Now if you’d call for the doctor, perhaps we can get this over.\r\nThat pain was only twenty minutes from the last. I think it’s about\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nKennon--who had attended several hundred Lani births and had developed a\r\ncertain callousness about them--was suddenly frightened and helpless\r\nas he pushed the call button. He could feel the cold sweat form on his\r\nforehead. He had started this. It was his fault if anything went wrong.\r\nHe wished that it was someone else rather than Copper who was going\r\nthrough this trial. He was nervous, unsure, and guilty. In a word, he\r\nfelt like a man whose mate was giving birth to their first child.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“It’s a boy,” Dr. Brainard said. He smiled down at Kennon’s haggard\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“How is Copper?” Kennon asked.\r\n\r\n“Fine--she’s healthy as a horse.”\r\n\r\nKennon winced at the cliche It was so ancient that it had lost all\r\nmeaning. Most Betans didn’t know what a horse was, let alone whether\r\nit was healthy or not. From what Kennon could remember of veterinary\r\nhistory, the horse wasn’t too healthy an animal. It was rather delicate,\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\n“How is the child?” Kennon asked. It took a little courage to ask this\r\nquestion. The baby could be anything from normal to a monstrosity.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly normal,” Brainard said. “A true Betan type even down to the\r\nvestigial tail. We amputated that, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Thank Ochsner!” Kennon breathed. “I was afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you were,” Brainard said. “Do you want to see them now? When\r\nI left, Copper was asking for you.”\r\n\r\nKennon sighed. Leaving, he realized, wasn’t going to be as easy as he\r\nhad thought.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to keep them here for a couple of months,” Brainard said.\r\n“We must take exhaustive tests if we expect the court to reverse its\r\nprior decision.”\r\n\r\n“I expected that,” Kennon said. He shrugged, “It’s probably best,” he\r\nsaid. “Now show me where Copper is.”\r\n\r\n“She’s back in the same room. You don’t need a guide.”\r\n\r\nKennon didn’t. In fact, he behaved quite admirably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nLongliners, Kennon reflected, didn’t make Beta a port of call, and the\r\nShortliner connections with other worlds were infrequent. Beta had done\r\na good job separating from the rest of the Brotherhood. Too good. The\r\nspaceline schedules showed only one departure in the next month, a\r\nShortliner for Earth, and from Earth the road to Kardon was long and\r\ntortuous, involving a series of short jumps from world to world and a\r\nfinal medium-range hop from Halsey to Kardon. If everything went right\r\nand he made every connection he would be in Kardon four months after he\r\nleft Beta. Kennon sighed as he left Travelers Aid. Morality was a heavy\r\nload to carry.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly down the road from the spaceport toward the\r\nCo-operative where he had been staying. He had left Huntersville and\r\nCopper a week ago, after he had seen his child. His child! The thought\r\nof being a father was oddly dismaying. It distorted his sense of values.\r\nBut one thing was certain. He was returning to Kardon, and Copper was\r\nnot coming with him. She had a duty to their son--and he had a duty to\r\nhis contract with Alexander, to the Lani on Flora, and to Copper--and\r\nnone of these could be satisfied by further running. He had to return\r\nand settle the account.\r\n\r\nA tall man in a conservative yellow-and-black suit was waiting patiently\r\nin front of his room. “My name is Richter,” he said “--Art Richter. Are\r\nyou Dr. Jac Kennon?”\r\n\r\n“I could deny it, but I won’t,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Doctor. It was just a formality anyway. You see, I know\r\nyou by sight.” He sighed. “One has to observe the formalities in this\r\nbusiness.” He drew a long white envelope from his tunic and handed it to\r\nKennon. “Most of my subjects try to deny their identity,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s a refreshing change to find an honest man.” He bowed formally.\r\n“I really thought this would be harder, considering the charges against\r\nyou.” He bowed again and walked away.\r\n\r\n“Now--what was that?” Kennon muttered as he opened the envelope. The\r\nman Richter was undoubtedly a process server--but who had hired him?\r\nHe unfolded the sheet and scanned the charges--coercion, larceny,\r\nlivestock theft, and breach of contract. He shrugged. This was\r\nAlexander’s work. What was the man thinking of? It was insanity to\r\nbring the Lani matter into open court. Hadn’t Douglas told him what had\r\nhappened? Couldn’t Alexander guess that he had fled with Copper for a\r\ngood reason--one that would stand up in court? Didn’t he know about the\r\nspacer? Or had Douglas turned on his cousin? The pup had so many hates\r\nthat it was possible. He was a natural troublemaker. Maybe Alexander\r\ndidn’t know. Maybe he was working in the dark. Kennon scanned the sheet\r\nquickly. Ah! here it was. Complaint--Mr. Alexander X. M. Alexander,\r\nSkyline Tower 1024, Beta City!\r\n\r\nAlexander! Here on Beta! Kennon opened the door of his room, went\r\nstraight to the phone beside the bed. He lifted the handset from its\r\ncradle and dialed the operator. “Get me Huntersville THU 2-1408. I want\r\nto speak to Dr. Brainard, Dr. Will Brainard. This is a priority\r\ncall--my name is Kennon. Dr. Jac Kennon D.V.M. I’m in the registry--47M\r\n26429--yes--of course, and thank you.” He waited a moment. “Hello--Dr.\r\nBrainard?--Kennon here. I’ve just had some news. Alexander’s on Beta!\r\nYes--he served me with a summons. Can you get a restraining order to\r\nprevent him from leaving? You can? Good! Here’s his address.” Kennon\r\nrattled off the location. “Yes--I’m taking the next airboat to Beta\r\nCity. This should simplify things considerably.--Of course it should. He\r\nwas a fool to have come here. Yes--I suppose you should tell Copper.\r\nOh! She is? I’m sorry to hear that, but there’s no reason for her to\r\nbe angry. She should realize that I did this for her--not to make her\r\nmiserable. Hmm.--She--she has? You think she should come with\r\nme?--Yes, I realize she can be a problem when she wants to be. All right\r\nthen--tell her to pack a toothbrush and a few spare diapers. And see if\r\nyou can get me a couple of tickets on the next flight to Beta City. I’ll\r\nbe over in a couple of hours and pick her up.” He cradled the phone and\r\ndialed the operator again.\r\n\r\n“I want the phone number of Skyline Tower 1024, Beta City, Mr.\r\nAlexander. Yes. I’ll wait. This number is HUV 2-1278 and my name\r\nis Kennon, Dr. Jac Kennon 47M 26429. I called you before. No, I’m a\r\ntransient. I can refer you to Dr. James Brainard, Huntersville Medical\r\nCenter. Yes, I’ll accept charges. Now will you give me that number? BCA\r\n7-8941--thank you.”\r\n\r\nKennon hung up, dialed the number, and waited.\r\n\r\n“Hello,” he said. “Mr. Alexander? This is Dr. Kennon.--Yes--I suppose\r\nyou do, but I’ve been trying to get back to Kardon for the past month.\r\nYou are? Well, that’s your privilege, but I’d advise you to go easy\r\nuntil I see you. Naturally--I’m coming as soon as I can get there. We’ll\r\nbe seeing you tomorrow morning at the latest. We?--I’m bringing Copper,\r\nof course. I just wanted you to know.”\r\n\r\nKennon wiped his forehead. Alexander sounded angry and dangerous. Ten\r\nyears hadn’t served to cool him off. What had happened on Kardon after\r\nhe had left? Kennon shook his head. There was something here he didn’t\r\nunderstand. The entrepreneur should have been covering his tracks, not\r\nthreatening jail and disaccreditation. It was obvious that a personal\r\nvisit was more necessary than he had thought.\r\n\r\nAlexander was waiting. His eyebrows rose at the sight of Copper in\r\nformal Betan dress--and lifted a trifle more at the sight of the baby.\r\n\r\n“What is this, Kennon?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Trouble,” Kennon said. He took off his hat. “I came here to settle\r\nthings before you took this case to court. You obviously do not\r\nunderstand what has happened. I suppose Douglas has double-crossed you.\r\nIt would be characteristic of him. But before we go any further I think\r\nwe should clear the air and let each other know where we stand. I\r\ndon’t want to make trouble if it’s not necessary. You’ll notice I’m not\r\nwearing a thought screen, so you’ll be able to check everything I say,\r\nand know I’m telling the truth.”\r\n\r\n“It had better be good,” Alexander said grimly. “I’ve been looking for\r\nyou for ten years. I intend to throw the book at you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know whether my reason is good or not. Technically I’m guilty\r\nof breach of contract and larceny of corporation property, but there are\r\nextenuating circumstances.”\r\n\r\nAlexander chuckled mirthlessly. “There are a few other charges. And\r\nquite probably I can think of more if you beat these. I’m going to make\r\nan example of you, Kennon. I’m going to drag you down and stamp on you.\r\nYou’re going to be a horrible example to all smart operators who think\r\nthey can break contracts. It’s taken a million credits and ten years’\r\ntime to hunt you down, but it’s going to be worth it.”\r\n\r\n“Copper’s child is a boy,” Kennon said mildly. “My son.”\r\n\r\nAlexander froze. “You can prove that?” he asked in a half-strangled\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nKennon nodded. “You see the extenuating circumstance?” he asked.\r\n“Suppression of human slavery!”\r\n\r\nAlexander sat down. It was as though some unseen hand had pulled his\r\nlegs from under him. “You believe it,” he said. “--No--you’ve proved\r\nit! Why--why didn’t you tell me? What sort of a man do you think I am?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know. I couldn’t take the chance until Copper was protected.\r\nYou see, sir, I love her.”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t hard to do with Lani,” Alexander said. He sank back in his\r\nchair, his face clouded, his expression troubled. It was obvious that\r\nthe realization shocked him.\r\n\r\nKennon felt an odd sympathy for the entrepreneur. It wasn’t a nice\r\nfeeling, he suspected, to have the beliefs of a lifetime ripped apart\r\nand sent to the disposal chute.\r\n\r\n“So the Lani are a human variant,” Alexander said dully.\r\n\r\n“The proof is here,” Kennon said, “and the supporting evidence is\r\nconclusive.”\r\n\r\n“Which makes me--what? A murderer? A slaver? A tyrant?” Alexander\r\nclutched his head with lean-fingered hands. “What am I?”\r\n\r\n“An innocent victim of circumstances,” Kennon said. “You didn’t know.\r\nNone of us knew. And we still wouldn’t know if the Lani weren’t of\r\nBetan extraction.” He grimaced painfully. “I’ve done some soul-searching\r\nmyself, and it hasn’t been a pleasant task.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s nothing like mine,” Alexander said in a low voice. “I\r\nsuspected they were human when I was younger, but I denied my suspicions\r\nand accepted false facts instead of investigating.”\r\n\r\n“You would have found nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, that’s not true. We discovered quite a bit from the\r\nexperimental station you left us when you disappeared ten years ago. But\r\nwe stopped when we found the age that was being indoctrinated with Lani\r\ntabus. We could have gone farther, but I didn’t think it was necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t Douglas tell you?” Kennon asked curiously. “I told him when I\r\nturned him loose.”\r\n\r\n“Douglas didn’t tell anything except that you had somehow gotten a\r\nspaceship. I assumed it was one of those that were involved in that\r\ncommercial raid a few decades ago, but I see it wasn’t. No--I knew\r\nnothing about this development. And Douglas, I guess, wanted to keep\r\nit hidden. He gave your co-ordinates and ordered Mullins to launch a\r\nmissile. But he apparently forgot to turn on his IFF. At any rate\r\nthe missile lost you--but found Douglas. Douglas was still talking to\r\nAlexandria when it struck.”\r\n\r\n“He might have informed you,” Kennon said. “If he had more time.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt it. He ordered the missile first. He was trying to destroy you\r\nbefore you could destroy Outworld Enterprises. His motives were selfish\r\nas usual.” Alexander looked at Kennon with a haggard eye. “I owe you an\r\napology,” he said. “I’ve considered you responsible for Douglas’s death\r\nfor ten years. I’ve searched for you on a hundred worlds. My agents in\r\nevery branch office have had standing orders to report any unusual\r\narrivals. I have hunted you personally. I wanted to break you--I wanted\r\nto kill you.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t help the delay,” Kennon said. “The ship was old.”\r\n\r\n“I know. You’ve told me more than you think. I’m a telepath, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve never forgotten it,” Kennon said. “That was one of the principal\r\nreasons I came here. I wanted to see how you’d react when you learned\r\nthe whole truth.”\r\n\r\n“And I suppose you gloat--no--you’re not doing that. But you are right.\r\nI could have checked it further. But I didn’t. Outworld Enterprises is\r\nfar bigger than Flora--and I was busy. Galactic trade is a snake-pit.\r\nAnd, after all, there was Douglas’s death--and the Family with their\r\nnever-ending clamor for money and their threats when it didn’t come\r\npromptly. I like being an entrepreneur, but until I made Outworld\r\nindependent of Family control, I couldn’t do anything except run the\r\nbusiness to their wishes. Actually the island was only a small part of\r\nthe corporation. I tried to run it as humanely as possible under the\r\ncircumstances.” He shuddered. “I don’t think I was ever needlessly\r\ncruel.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Kennon said, “you were indifferent.”\r\n\r\n“Which is just as bad,” Alexander said.\r\n\r\n“Well--what are you going to do about it?” Copper interjected. “You can\r\nbeat yourself until you’re blue, but that won’t accomplish anything.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?” Alexander countered. “You have the upper\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\n“Me?” Copper asked. “I have nothing. This is between you men.” She\r\nlapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nAlexander turned back to Kennon. “You have undoubtedly made some\r\narrangements. You wouldn’t come here--oh! I see. Congratulations.\r\nHandling the evidence that way was a wise course. You have my\r\nadmiration. But then I should have known that I was not dealing with a\r\nfool.” He smiled wryly. “Subconsciously I think I did know--but--”\r\n\r\n“That’s one consolation,” Kennon grinned. “To be thought a rascal is bad\r\nenough, but to be considered a fool is intolerable.”\r\n\r\n“But your decision not to use the evidence unless you were forced\r\nto--that’s poor business.”\r\n\r\n“But good morals,” Kennon said. “Neither the Brotherhood nor I could\r\nsettle this affair. It is a matter only you can handle. There is\r\nno sense in killing Outworld or throwing Kardon into centuries of\r\nlitigation. The Lani never were numerous enough to lay claim to an\r\nentire world. I’ll admit the club is there, but I’ll never use it unless\r\nit’s necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?--it’s sound business practice.”\r\n\r\n“I’m a professional--not a businessman. And besides, I haven’t the moral\r\nright to return evil for good. You have not been a bad boss.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” Alexander said glumly. “I’ve always considered myself\r\ncivilized.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,” Kennon said. “Honorable,\r\nyes--civilized, no. But none of us are really civilized.”\r\n\r\n“So?”\r\n\r\n“We haven’t changed much, despite our development. Perhaps we’ve varied\r\na little physically--and we’ve learned to use new tools, but our minds\r\nare still the minds of barbarians--blood brothers against the enemy, and\r\neverything not of us is enemy. Savages--hiding under a thin veneer\r\nof superficial culture. Savages with spaceships and the atom.” Kennon\r\nlooked down at Copper. Apparently her thoughts were miles away in an\r\nintrospective world that was all her own. She had said her piece and\r\nhaving done that was content to let the two men develop it. Kennon\r\nlooked at her with odd respect. Alexander eyed her with a mildly\r\nstartled expression on his lean face. And both men smiled, but the\r\nsmiles were not amused.\r\n\r\n“Judging from Copper,” Alexander said, “I don’t think we’ll have to\r\nworry about how the Lani will turn out.” He looked at Kennon with mild\r\nsympathy. “You are going to have quite a time with her,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so. I’ll probably never know whether I’m guided or whether\r\nI’m doing the guiding. I’ve changed a lot of my opinions about Copper\r\nsince the day I met her.”\r\n\r\nCopper looked up and smiled at them. It was an odd smile, hinting at\r\nsecrets neither of them would ever know. Alexander chuckled. “It serves\r\nyou right.” He crossed his legs and looked up at Kennon standing before\r\nhim. By some uncanny legerdemain he had gotten control of himself\r\nand the situation at the same time. Being telepathic was an unfair\r\nadvantage, Kennon thought.\r\n\r\n“You were equally unfair with your accusation,” Alexander said.\r\n“Sure--humanity makes mistakes, and like this one they’re sometimes\r\nbrutal mistakes. But we are capable of atonement. Morally we have come a\r\nlong way from the brutality of the Interregnum. I shouldn’t have to use\r\nexamples, but look at that”--he waved at the view wall at the panorama\r\nof gleaming fairy towers and greenery that made Beta City one of the\r\nmost beautiful in the Brotherhood. “Don’t tell me that five thousand\r\nyears of peace and development haven’t produced civilization. That’s a\r\nconcrete example out there.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t,” Kennon said flatly. “Sure, it’s pretty--clean--and\r\nbeautifully designed for art and utility--but it isn’t civilization.\r\nYou’re confusing technology with culture. You look at this and say,\r\n‘What a great civilization man has built,’ when you really mean, ‘What\r\na great technology mankind has developed.’ There’s all the difference in\r\nthe world. Technology is of the mind and hands. Civilization is of the\r\nspirit--and spiritually we are still in the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\n“We conquer, kill, loot, and enslave. We establish standards to keep\r\nhumanity a closed corporation, a special club in which men can live but\r\naliens can’t. We’ve made the standards for admission so rigid that\r\nwe even enslave our own kind and call them animals. That’s not\r\ncivilization--that’s savagery!\r\n\r\n“For nearly five hundred years your family has run a slave pen. Your\r\nfortune is based upon it. And you have perpetuated this traffic in flesh\r\non the specious reasoning that a court judgment of half a millennium ago\r\nis as good today as when it was handed down. Never once did anyone have\r\nthe moral courage to re-examine that old decision. Never once did any\r\nhuman question the rightness of that decision. None of us are immune.\r\nWe all based our conduct upon an antiquated law and searched no further.\r\nEveryone was happy with the status quo--or at least not so unhappy that\r\nthey wanted to change it. Even I would have been content had it not been\r\nfor Copper.”\r\n\r\n“Yet I do not feel that it was bad that I hired you,” Alexander said.\r\n“Even though you have shown me that I am a slaver, and made me see\r\nfaults I never knew I had.” His face was drawn--harsh lines reached from\r\nnose to lips, from eyes to chin. Suddenly he looked old. “I can accept\r\ncensure if censure is just. And this is just. No--I’m not sorry I hired\r\nyou even though the thought of what I have helped do to the Lani makes\r\nme sick to my stomach.”\r\n\r\n“Well--” Kennon said. “What are you going to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” Alexander said. “At the first smell of trouble, the\r\nFamily will turn tail and run. You can break the company, and I won’t\r\nstand in your way. It’s only just. You’re the one who’s carrying the\r\nball. Now run with it.”\r\n\r\n“That damned blind spot,” Kennon said. “You realize, of course, that\r\nyou’re not legally liable. It was a mistake. All you have to do is admit\r\nthe error and start from there. Naturally--no reasonable intelligence\r\nwould expect that you change the older Lani. They’re too old for either\r\nagerone or change. It would be both cruel and inhuman to turn them\r\nloose. It’s with the youngsters that you can work--those who are\r\nphysically and physiologically young enough to derive benefit from\r\nagerone and education.\r\n\r\n“As I remember, you bought a planet called Phoebe. Now why don’t you--”\r\n\r\n“Phase out! Of course! But that means that you can’t press charges.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I? I’m not one of these starry-eyed reformers who expect\r\nto change things overnight. It’s the future of the Lani race that’s\r\nimportant, And Brainard agrees with me. A phase-out is the proper\r\nsolution. Change the education, let males be born--teach the young to\r\nthink instead of to obey. Give them Phoebe for a home--they never owned\r\nall of Kardon anyway. And within a century or two we will have a new\r\ngroup of the human race--and then we can tell the Brotherhood.”\r\n\r\nKennon looked inquiringly at Copper. She smiled and nodded. “It would\r\ncause less trouble that way,” she said. “It would be more sure--and\r\nthere are never too many old ones.”\r\n\r\nKennon shuddered, thinking of the euthanasia chambers on Otpen One.\r\n“There will be more from now on,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Outworld can afford it. It’ll bend us a little but we won’t break--and\r\nbesides, the Lani will need our help for some time to come.” Alexander\r\nlooked at Kennon. “Can we make an agreement that all parties will\r\nrespect?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I think so--providing there are no sleeper clauses in it,” Kennon said.\r\n\r\n“There won’t be,” Alexander said.\r\n\r\nAnd there weren’t.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIt was a private ceremony. The Family, sulky and unwilling, faced with\r\na choice of drastically reduced income or outright confiscation and\r\npreferring a portion of a loaf to none. Alexander--grim but oddly\r\npeaceful of expression. Brainard--pink-cheeked and emotionless. Kennon\r\nand Copper--happily conscious that it was at last finished. It was an\r\noddly assorted group of conspirators who planned to restore a segment of\r\nhumanity to the human race.\r\n\r\nKennon signed last, and as he did, Alexander looked at him with a sly\r\ngrin distorting the smooth pallor of his face.\r\n\r\n“You forgot something,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What?” Kennon said--aware suddenly that something was wrong.\r\n\r\n“What do you plan to do, now that this is over?”\r\n\r\n“Join the Medical Center here and practice veterinary medicine.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t care to work for me--to help rebuild the wreckage you’ve\r\nhelped create? I’ll need a manager on Kardon to phase out the island\r\nwhile we phase in Phoebe.”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you. I’ve had enough of that.”\r\n\r\n“You just think you have,” Alexander said gleefully. “That’s what you\r\nhave forgotten. You’ve gotten your agreement--now you will satisfy me.\r\nAs I see it you have breached your contract by leaving Flora without\r\nauthorization.”\r\n\r\n“That is right,” Kennon said. A small lump of lead began to grow rapidly\r\nlarger in his stomach. Brainard was grinning and Copper’s eyes were\r\nshining. “You’ve been jobbed!” his mind told him. He sighed. He knew\r\nwhat was coming next.\r\n\r\n“The punitive clause for breach of contract,” Alexander went on\r\ninexorably, “is very broad. Discretion is vested in the entrepreneur. I\r\ncan obtain judgment against you in any court on any planet.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” Kennon said glumly.\r\n\r\n“But I am going to be civilized,” Alexander said. “I am going to be\r\nmerciful. I am going to extend your contract until phase-out has been\r\ncompleted. You are going to have control of the entire Kardon phase of\r\nthe operation. It’s poetic justice--you made the mess--now you can clean\r\nit up.”\r\n\r\n“That’s inhuman!”\r\n\r\n“Humanity has nothing to do with it. It’s justice,” Alexander said. He\r\nsmiled at Copper’s radiant face. The thought of going home was good to\r\nher. “Good luck on your new job, Dr. Kennon,” he said. “And welcome to\r\nthe brotherhood of the ulcer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Lani People, by J.
