The following essay is designed, therefore, to supply\r\nan obvious want. Its results are given in some detail up to the date of\r\npublication. Part I. presents in a popular form the leading historical\r\nfacts as to the discovery of Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta, and Astræa; a\r\ntabular statement of the dates and places of discovery for the entire\r\ngroup; a list of the names of discoverers, with the number of minor\r\nplanets detected by each; and a table of the principal elements so far\r\nas computed.\r\n\r\nIn Part II. this descriptive summary is followed by questions relating\r\nto the origin of the cluster; the elimination of members from particular\r\nparts; the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits; and the\r\nrelation of the zone to comets of short period. The elements are those\r\ngiven in the Paris _Annuaire_ for 1887, or in recent numbers of the\r\n_Circular zum Berliner Astronomischen Jahrbuch_.\r\n\r\nDANIEL KIRKWOOD.\r\n\r\nBLOOMINGTON, INDIANA, November, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n PART I.

Introductory.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANETARY DISCOVERIES BEFORE THE ASTEROIDS WERE KNOWN.\r\n\r\nThe first observer who watched the skies with any degree of care could\r\nnot fail to notice that while the greater number of stars maintained the\r\nsame relative places, a few from night to night were ever changing their\r\npositions. The planetary character of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and\r\nSaturn was thus known before the dawn of history. The names, however, of\r\nthose who first distinguished them as \"wanderers\" are hopelessly lost.\r\nVenus, the morning and evening star, was long regarded as two distinct\r\nbodies. The discovery that the change of aspect was due to a single\r\nplanet's change of position is ascribed to Pythagoras.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century but six primary planets and\r\none satellite were known as members of the solar system. Very few, even\r\nof the learned, had then accepted the theory of Copernicus; in fact,\r\nbefore the invention of the telescope the evidence in its favor was not\r\nabsolutely conclusive. On the 7th of January, 1610, Galileo first saw\r\nthe satellites of Jupiter. The bearing of this discovery on the theory\r\nof the universe was sufficiently obvious. Such was the prejudice,\r\nhowever, against the Copernican system that some of its opponents denied\r\neven the reality of Galileo's discovery. \"Those satellites,\" said a\r\nTuscan astronomer, \"are invisible to the naked eye, and therefore can\r\nexercise no influence on the earth, and therefore would be useless, and\r\ntherefore do not exist. Besides, the Jews and other ancient nations, as\r\nwell as modern Europeans, have adopted the division of the week into\r\n_seven_ days, and have named them from the seven planets; now, if we\r\nincrease the number of planets this whole system falls to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nNo other secondary planet was discovered till March 25, 1655, when\r\nTitan, the largest satellite of Saturn, was detected by Huyghens. About\r\ntwo years later (December 7, 1657) the same astronomer discovered the\r\ntrue form of Saturn's ring; and before the close of the century\r\n(1671-1684) four more satellites, Japetus, Rhea, Tethys, and Dione, were\r\nadded to the Saturnian system by the elder Cassini. Our planetary\r\nsystem, therefore, as known at the close of the seventeenth century,\r\nconsisted of six primary and ten secondary planets.\r\n\r\nNearly a century had elapsed from the date of Cassini's discovery of\r\nDione, when, on the 13th of March, 1781, Sir William Herschel\r\nenlarged the dimensions of our system by the detection of a\r\nplanet--Uranus--exterior to Saturn. A few years later (1787-1794) the\r\nsame distinguished observer discovered the first and second satellites\r\nof Saturn, and also the four Uranian satellites. He was the only planet\r\ndiscoverer of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Discovery of the First Asteroids.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as the commencement of the seventeenth century the\r\ncelebrated Kepler observed that the respective distances of the planets\r\nfrom the sun formed nearly a regular progression. The series, however,\r\nby which those distances were expressed required the interpolation of a\r\nterm between Mars and Jupiter,--a fact which led the illustrious German\r\nto predict the discovery of a planet in that interval. This conjecture\r\nattracted but little attention till after the discovery of Uranus, whose\r\ndistance was found to harmonize in a remarkable manner with Kepler's\r\norder of progression. Such a coincidence was of course regarded with\r\nconsiderable interest. Towards the close of the last century Professor\r\nBode, who had given the subject much attention, published the law of\r\ndistances which bears his name, but which, as he acknowledged, is due to\r\nProfessor Titius. According to this formula the distances of the planets\r\nfrom Mercury's orbit form a geometrical series of which the ratio is\r\ntwo. In other words, if we reckon the distances of Venus, the earth,\r\netc., from the orbit of Mercury, instead of from the sun, we find\r\nthat--interpolating a term between Mars and Jupiter--the distance of any\r\nmember of the system is very nearly half that of the next exterior.\r\nBaron De Zach, an enthusiastic astronomer, was greatly interested in\r\nBode's empirical scheme, and undertook to determine the elements of the\r\nhypothetical planet. In 1800 a number of astronomers met at Lilienthal,\r\norganized an astronomical society, and assigned one twenty-fourth part\r\nof the zodiac to each of twenty-four observers, in order to detect, if\r\npossible, the unseen planet. When it is remembered that at this time no\r\nprimary planet had been discovered within the ancient limits of the\r\nsolar system, that the object to be looked for was comparatively near\r\nus, and that the so-called law of distances was purely empirical, the\r\nprospect of success, it is evident, was extremely uncertain. How long\r\nthe watch, if unsuccessful, might have been continued is doubtful. The\r\nobject of research, however, was fortunately brought to light before the\r\nmembers of the astronomical association had fairly commenced their\r\nlabors.[1]\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1801, Professor Giuseppe Piazzi, of Palermo,\r\nnoticed a star of the eighth magnitude, not indicated in Wollaston's\r\ncatalogue. Subsequent observations soon revealed its planetary\r\ncharacter, its mean distance corresponding very nearly with the\r\ncalculations of De Zach. The discoverer called it Ceres Ferdinandea, in\r\nhonor of his sovereign, the King of Naples. In this, however, he was not\r\nfollowed by astronomers, and the planet is now known by the name of\r\nCeres alone. The discovery of this body was hailed by astronomers with\r\nthe liveliest gratification as completing the harmony of the system.\r\nWhat, then, was their surprise when in the course of a few months this\r\nremarkable order was again interrupted! On the 28th of March, 1802, Dr.\r\nWilliam Olbers, of Bremen, while examining the relative positions of the\r\nsmall stars along the path of Ceres, in order to find that planet with\r\nthe greater facility, noticed a star of the seventh or eighth magnitude,\r\nforming with two others an equilateral triangle where he was certain no\r\nsuch configuration existed a few months before. In the course of a few\r\nhours its motion was perceptible, and on the following night it had very\r\nsensibly changed its position with respect to the neighboring stars.\r\nAnother planet was therefore detected, and Dr. Olbers immediately\r\ncommunicated his discovery to Professor Bode and Baron De Zach. In his\r\nletter to the former he suggested Pallas as the name of the new member\r\nof the system,--a name which was at once adopted. Its orbit, which was\r\nsoon computed by Gauss, was found to present several striking anomalies.\r\nThe inclination of its plane to that of the ecliptic was nearly\r\nthirty-five degrees,--an amount of deviation altogether extraordinary.\r\nThe eccentricity also was greater than in the case of any of the old\r\nplanets. These peculiarities, together with the fact that the mean\r\ndistances of Ceres and Pallas were nearly the same, and that their\r\norbits approached very near each other at the intersection of their\r\nplanes, suggested the hypothesis that they are fragments of a single\r\noriginal planet, which, at a very remote epoch, was disrupted by some\r\nmysterious convulsion. This theory will be considered when we come to\r\ndiscuss the tabulated elements of the minor planets now known.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of astronomers, Professor Harding, of Lilienthal,\r\nundertook the construction of charts of all the small stars near the\r\norbits of Ceres and Pallas. On the evening of September 1, 1804, while\r\nengaged in observations for this purpose, he noticed a star of the\r\neighth magnitude not mentioned in the great catalogue of Lalande. This\r\nproved to be a third member of the group of asteroids. The discovery was\r\nfirst announced to Dr. Olbers, who observed the planet at Bremen on the\r\nevening of September 7.\r\n\r\nBefore Ceres had been generally adopted by astronomers as the name of\r\nthe first asteroid, Laplace had expressed a preference for Juno. This,\r\nhowever, the discoverer was unwilling to accept. Mr. Harding, like\r\nLaplace, deeming it appropriate to place Juno near Jupiter, selected the\r\nname for the third minor planet, which is accordingly known by this\r\ndesignation.\r\n\r\nJuno is distinguished among the first asteroids by the great\r\neccentricity of its orbit, amounting to more than 0.25. Its least and\r\nits greatest distances from the sun are therefore to each other very\r\nnearly in the ratio of three to five. The planet consequently receives\r\nnearly three times as much light and heat in perihelion as in aphelion.\r\nIt follows, also, that the half of the orbit nearest the sun is\r\ndescribed in about eighteen months, while the remainder, or more distant\r\nhalf, is not passed over in much less than three years. Schroeter\r\nnoticed a variation in the light of Juno, which he supposed to be\r\nproduced by an axial rotation in about twenty-seven hours.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Juno was discovered not far from the point at which the\r\norbit of Pallas approaches very near that of Ceres, was considered a\r\nstrong confirmation of the hypothesis that the asteroids were produced\r\nby the explosion of a large planet; for in case this hypothesis be\r\nfounded in truth, it is evident that whatever may have been the forms of\r\nthe various orbits assumed by the fragments, they must all return to the\r\npoint of separation. In order, therefore, to detect other members of the\r\ngroup, Dr. Olbers undertook a systematic examination of the two opposite\r\nregions of the heavens through which they must pass. This search was\r\nprosecuted with great industry and perseverance till ultimately crowned\r\nwith success. On the 29th of March, 1807, while sweeping over one of\r\nthose regions through which the orbits of the known asteroids passed, a\r\nstar of the sixth magnitude was observed where none had been seen at\r\nprevious examinations. Its planetary character, which was immediately\r\nsuspected, was confirmed by observation, its motion being detected on\r\nthe very evening of its discovery. This fortunate result afforded the\r\nfirst instance of the discovery of two primary planets by the same\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer Gauss having been requested to name the new planet, fixed\r\nupon Vesta, a name universally accepted. Though the brightest of the\r\nasteroids, its apparent diameter is too small to be accurately\r\ndetermined, and hence its real magnitude is not well ascertained.\r\nProfessor Harrington, of Ann Arbor, has estimated the diameter at five\r\nhundred and twenty miles. According to others, however, it does not\r\nexceed three hundred. If the latter be correct, the volume is about\r\n1/20000 that of the earth. It is remarkable that notwithstanding its\r\ndiminutive size it may be seen under favorable circumstances by the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the discovery of Vesta (which he regarded as almost a\r\ndemonstration of his favorite theory), Dr. Olbers continued his\r\nsystematic search for other planetary fragments. Not meeting, however,\r\nwith further success, he relinquished his observations in 1816. His\r\nfailure, it may here be remarked, was doubtless owing to the fact that\r\nhis examination was limited to stars of the seventh and eighth\r\nmagnitudes.\r\n\r\nThe search for new planets was next resumed about 1831, by Herr Hencke,\r\nof Driessen. With a zeal and perseverance worthy of all praise, this\r\namateur astronomer employed himself in a strict examination of the\r\nheavens represented by the Maps of the Berlin Academy. These maps extend\r\nfifteen degrees on each side of the equator, and contain all stars down\r\nto the ninth magnitude and many of the tenth. Dr. Hencke rendered some\r\nof these charts still more complete by the insertion of smaller stars;\r\nor rather, \"made for himself special charts of particular districts.\" On\r\nthe evening of December 8, 1845, he observed a star of the ninth\r\nmagnitude where none had been previously seen, as he knew from the fact\r\nthat it was neither found on his own chart nor given on that of the\r\nAcademy. On the next morning he wrote to Professors Encke and Schumacher\r\ninforming them of his supposed discovery. \"It is very improbable,\" he\r\nremarked in his letter to the latter, \"that this should prove to be\r\nmerely a variable star, since in my former observations of this region,\r\nwhich have been continued for many years, I have never detected the\r\nslightest trace of it.\" The new star was soon seen at the principal\r\nobservatories of Europe, and its planetary character satisfactorily\r\nestablished. The selection of a name was left by the discoverer to\r\nProfessor Encke, who chose that of Astræa.\r\n\r\nThe facts in regard to the very numerous subsequent discoveries may best\r\nbe presented in a tabular form.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n_The Asteroids in the Order of their Discovery._\r\n\r\n -----------------+----------------+---------------+------------\r\n   Asteroids.     | Date of        | Name of       | Place of\r\n                  | Discovery.     | Discoverer.   | Discovery.\r\n -----------------+----------------+---------------+------------\r\n   1.

Charlois,\r\n     Cottenot,\r\n     D'Arrest,\r\n     De Ball,\r\n     Graham,\r\n     Harding,\r\n     Laurent,\r\n     Piazzi,\r\n     Schiaparelli,\r\n     Schulhof,\r\n     Stephan,\r\n     Searle,\r\n     and Tietjen, each          1\r\n\r\nBefore arrangements had been made for the telegraphic transmission\r\nof discoveries between Europe and America, or even between the\r\nobservatories of Europe, the same planet was sometimes independently\r\ndiscovered by different observers. For example, Virginia was found by\r\nFerguson, at Washington, on October 4, 1857, and by Luther, at Bilk,\r\nfifteen days later. In all cases, however, credit has been given to the\r\nfirst observer.\r\n\r\nHersilia, the two hundred and sixth of the group, was lost before\r\nsufficient observations were obtained for determining its elements. It\r\nwas not rediscovered till December 14, 1884. Menippe, the one hundred\r\nand eighty-eighth, was also lost soon after its discovery in 1878. It\r\nhas not been seen for more than nine years, and considerable uncertainty\r\nattaches to its estimated elements.\r\n\r\nOf the two hundred and seventy-one members now known (1887), one hundred\r\nand ninety-one have been discovered in Europe, seventy-four in America,\r\nand six in Asia. The years of most successful search, together with the\r\nnumber discovered in each, were:\r\n\r\n           Asteroids.\r\n 1879         20\r\n 1875         17\r\n 1868         12\r\n 1878         12\r\n\r\nAnd six has been the average yearly number since the commencement of\r\nrenewed effort in 1845. All the larger members of the group have,\r\ndoubtless, been discovered. It seems not improbable, however, that an\r\nindefinite number of very small bodies belonging to the zone remain to\r\nbe found. The process of discovery is becoming more difficult as the\r\nknown number increases. The astronomer, for instance, who may discover\r\nnumber two hundred and seventy-two must know the simultaneous positions\r\nof the two hundred and seventy-one previously detected before he can\r\ndecide whether he has picked up a new planet or merely rediscovered an\r\nold one. The numbers discovered in the several months are as follows:\r\n\r\n January      13\r\n February     23\r\n March        19\r\n April        35\r\n May          21\r\n June         13\r\n July         14\r\n August       28\r\n September    46\r\n October      28\r\n November     26\r\n December      5\r\n\r\nThis obvious disparity is readily explained. The weather is favorable\r\nfor night watching in April and September; the winter months are too\r\ncold for continuous observations; and the small numbers in June and July\r\nmay be referred to the shortness of the nights.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Mode of Discovery.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer who would undertake the search for new asteroids must\r\nsupply himself with star-charts extending some considerable distance on\r\neach side of the ecliptic, and containing all telescopic stars down to\r\nthe thirteenth or fourteenth magnitude. The detection of a star not\r\nfound in the chart of a particular section will indicate its motion, and\r\nhence its planetary character. The construction of such charts has been\r\na principal object in the labors of Dr. Peters, at Clinton, New York. In\r\nfact, his discovery of minor planets has in most instances been merely\r\nan incidental result of his larger and more important work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES AND SYMBOLS.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the names of female deities in the Greek and Roman\r\nmythologies had been given to the first asteroids suggested a similar\r\ncourse in the selection of names after the new epoch of discovery in\r\n1845. While conformity to this rule has been the general aim of\r\ndiscoverers, the departures from it have been increasingly numerous. The\r\ntwelfth asteroid, discovered in London, was named Victoria, in honor of\r\nthe reigning sovereign; the twentieth and twenty-fifth, detected at\r\nMarseilles,[2] received names indicative of the place of their\r\ndiscovery; Lutetia, the first found at Paris, received its name for a\r\nsimilar purpose; the fifty-fourth was named Alexandra, for Alexander von\r\nHumboldt; the sixty-seventh, found by Pogson at Madras, was named Asia,\r\nto commemorate the fact that it was the first discovered on that\r\ncontinent. We find, also, Julia, Bertha, Xantippe, Zelia, Maria,\r\nIsabella, Martha, Dido, Cleopatra, Barbara, Ida, Augusta, and Anna. Why\r\nthese were selected we will not stop to inquire.\r\n\r\nAs the number of asteroids increased it was found inconvenient to\r\ndesignate them individually by particular signs, as in the case of the\r\nold planets. In 1849, Dr. B. A. Gould proposed to represent them by the\r\nnumbers expressing their order of discovery enclosed in a small circle.\r\nThis method was at once very generally adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Magnitudes of the Asteroids.\r\n\r\nThe apparent diameter of the largest is less than one-second of arc.\r\nThey are all too small, therefore, to be accurately measured by\r\nastronomical instruments. From photometric observations, however,\r\nArgelander,[3] Stone,[4] and Pickering[5] have formed estimates of the\r\ndiameters, the results giving probably close approximations to the true\r\nmagnitudes. According to these estimates the diameter of the largest,\r\nVesta, is about three hundred miles, that of Ceres about two hundred,\r\nand those of Pallas and Juno between one and two hundred. The diameters\r\nof about thirty are between fifty and one hundred miles, and those of\r\nall others less than fifty; the estimates for Menippe and Eva giving\r\ntwelve and thirteen miles respectively. The diameter of the former is to\r\nthat of the earth as one to six hundred and sixty-four; and since\r\nspheres are to each other as the cubes of their diameters, it would\r\nrequire two hundred and ninety millions of such asteroids to form a\r\nplanet as large as our globe. In other words, if the earth be\r\nrepresented by a sphere one foot in diameter, the magnitude of Menippe\r\non the same scale would be that of a sand particle whose diameter is one\r\nfifty-fifth of an inch. Its surface contains about four hundred and\r\nforty square miles,--an area equal to a county twenty-one miles square.\r\nThe surface attractions of two planets having the same density are to\r\neach other as their diameters. A body, therefore, weighing two hundred\r\npounds at the earth's surface would on the surface of the asteroid weigh\r\nless than five ounces. At the earth's surface a weight falls sixteen\r\nfeet the first second, at the surface of Menippe it would fall about\r\none-fourth of an inch. A person might leap from its surface to a height\r\nof several hundred feet, in which case he could not return in much less\r\nthan an hour. \"But of such speculations,\" Sir John Herschel remarks,\r\n\"there is no end.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of these planetules between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in\r\nall probability can never be known. It was estimated by Leverrier that\r\nthe quantity of matter contained in the group could not be greater than\r\none-fourth of the earth's mass. But this would be equal to five thousand\r\nplanets, each as large as Vesta, to seventy-two millions as large as\r\nMenippe, or to four thousand millions of five miles in diameter. In\r\nshort, the existence of an indefinite number too small for detection by\r\nthe most powerful glasses is by no means improbable. The more we study\r\nthis wonderful section of the solar system, the more mystery seems to\r\nenvelop its origin and constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The Orbits of the Asteroids.\r\n\r\nThe form, magnitude, and position of a planet's orbit are determined by\r\nthe following elements:\r\n\r\n1. The semi-axis major, or mean distance, denoted by the symbol _a_.\r\n\r\n2. The eccentricity, _e_.\r\n\r\n3. The longitude of the perihelion, _π_.\r\n\r\n4. The longitude of the ascending node, ☊.\r\n\r\n5. The inclination, or the angle contained between the plane of the\r\norbit and that of the ecliptic, _i_.\r\n\r\nAnd in order to compute a planet's place in its orbit for any given time\r\nwe must also know\r\n\r\n6. Its period, _P_, and\r\n\r\n7. Its mean longitude, _l_, at a given epoch.\r\n\r\nThese elements, except the last, are given for all the asteroids, so far\r\nas known, in Table II. In column first the number denoting the order of\r\ndiscovery is attached to each name.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\n_Elements of the Asteroids._\r\n\r\n -----------------+--------+---------+--------+----------+----------+--------\r\n    Name          |  _a_   |   _P_   |  _e_   |  _π_     |   ☊      |   _i_\r\n -----------------+--------+---------+--------+----------+----------+--------\r\n 149.

Extent of the Zone.\r\n\r\nIn Table II. the unit of column _a_ is the earth's mean distance from\r\nthe sun, or ninety-three million miles. On this scale the breadth of the\r\nzone is 1.8196. Or, if we estimate the breadth from the perihelion of\r\nÆthra (1.612) to the aphelion of Andromache (4.726), it is 3.114,--more\r\nthan three times the radius of the earth's orbit. A very remarkable\r\ncharacteristic of the group is the interlacing or intertwining of\r\norbits. \"One fact,\" says D'Arrest, \"seems above all to confirm the idea\r\nof an intimate relation between all the minor planets; it is, that if\r\ntheir orbits are figured under the form of material rings, these rings\r\nwill be found so entangled that it would be possible, by means of one\r\namong them taken at hazard, to lift up all the rest.\"[6] Our present\r\nknowledge of this wide and complicated cluster is the result of a vast\r\namount, not only of observations, but also of mathematical labor. In\r\nview, however, of the perturbations of these bodies by the larger\r\nplanets, and especially by Jupiter, it is easy to see that the\r\ndiscussion of their motions must present a field of investigation\r\npractically boundless.\r\n\r\nWhile the known minor planets were but few in number the theory of\r\nOlbers in regard to their origin seemed highly probable; it has,\r\nhowever, been completely disproved by more recent discoveries. The\r\nbreadth of the zone being now greater than the distance of Mars from the\r\nsun, it is no more probable that the asteroids were produced by the\r\ndisruption of a single planet than that Mercury, Venus, the earth, and\r\nMars originated in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Small Mass of the Asteroids.\r\n\r\nIn taking a general view of the solar system we cannot fail to be struck\r\nby the remarkable fact that Jupiter, whose mass is much greater than\r\nthat of all other planets united, should be immediately succeeded by a\r\nregion so nearly destitute of matter as the zone of asteroids. Leverrier\r\ninferred from the motion of Mars's perihelion that the mass of Jupiter\r\nis at least twelve hundred times greater than that of all the planets in\r\nthe asteroid ring. The fact is suggestive of Jupiter's dominating energy\r\nin the evolution of the asteroid system. We find also something\r\nanalogous among the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Jupiter's\r\nthird satellite, the largest of the number, is nearly four times greater\r\nthan the second. Immediately within the orbit of Titan, the largest\r\nsatellite of Saturn, occurs a wide hiatus, and the volume of the next\r\ninterior satellite is to that of Titan in the ratio of one to\r\ntwenty-one. In the Uranian system the widest interval between adjacent\r\norbits is just within the orbit of the bright satellite, Titania.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts suggest the inquiry, What effect would be produced\r\nby a large planet on interior masses abandoned by a central spheroid? As\r\nthe phenomena in all instances would be of the same nature, we will\r\nconsider a single case,--that of Jupiter and the asteroids.\r\n\r\nThe powerful mass of the exterior body would produce great perturbations\r\nof the neighboring small planets abandoned at the solar equator. The\r\ndisturbed orbits, in some cases, would thus attain considerable\r\neccentricity, so that the matter moving in them would, in perihelion, be\r\nbrought in contact with the equatorial parts of the central body, and\r\nthus become reunited with it.[7] The extreme rarity of the zone between\r\nMars and Jupiter, regarded as a single ring, is thus accounted for in\r\naccordance with known dynamical laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Limits of Perihelion Distance.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficiently obvious that whenever the perihelion distance of a\r\nplanet or comet is less than the sun's radius, a collision must occur as\r\nthe moving body approaches the focus of its path. The great comet of\r\n1843 passed so near the sun as almost to graze its surface. With a\r\nperihelion distance but very slightly less, it would have been\r\nprecipitated into the sun and incorporated with its mass. In former\r\nepochs, when the dimensions of the sun were much greater than at\r\npresent, this falling of comets into the central orb of the system must\r\nhave been a comparatively frequent occurrence. Again, if Mercury's orbit\r\nhad its present eccentricity when the radius of the solar spheroid was\r\ntwenty-nine million miles, the planet at its nearest approach to the\r\ncentre of its motion must have passed through the outer strata of the\r\ncentral body. In such case a lessening of the planet's mean distance\r\nwould be a necessary consequence. We thus see that in the formation of\r\nthe solar system the eccentricity of an asteroidal orbit could not\r\nincrease beyond a moderate limit without the planet's return to the\r\nsolar mass. The bearing of these views on the arrangement of the minor\r\nplanets will appear in what follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Was the Asteroid Zone originally Stable?--Distribution of the Members\r\nin Space.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting discoveries of the eighteenth century was\r\nLagrange's law securing the stability of the solar system. This\r\ncelebrated theorem, however, is not to be understood in an absolute or\r\nunlimited sense. It makes no provision against the effect of a resisting\r\nmedium, or against the entrance of cosmic matter from without. It does\r\nnot secure the stability of all periodic comets nor of the meteor\r\nstreams revolving about the sun. In the early stages of the system's\r\ndevelopment the matter moving in unstable orbits may have been, and\r\nprobably was, much more abundant than at present. But even now, are we\r\njustified in concluding that all known asteroids have stable orbits? For\r\nthe major planets the secular variations of eccentricity have been\r\ncalculated, but for the orbits between Mars and Jupiter these limits are\r\nunknown. With an eccentricity of 0.252 (less than that of many\r\nasteroids), the distance of Hilda's aphelion would be greater than that\r\nof Jupiter's perihelion. It seems possible, therefore, that certain\r\nminor planets may have their orbits much changed by Jupiter's disturbing\r\ninfluence.[8]\r\n\r\nWhoever looks at a table of asteroids arranged in their order of\r\ndiscovery will find only a perplexing mass of figures. Whether we regard\r\ntheir distances, their inclinations, or the forms of their orbits, the\r\nelements of the members are without any obvious connection. Nor is the\r\nconfusion lessened when the orbits are drawn and presented to the eye.\r\nIn fact, the crossing and recrossing of so many ellipses of various\r\nforms merely increase the entanglement. But can no order be traced in\r\nall this complexity? Are there no breaks or vacant spaces within the\r\nzone's extreme limits? Has Jupiter's influence been effective in fixing\r\nthe position and arrangement of the cluster? Such are some of the\r\nquestions demanding our attention. If \"the universe is a book written\r\nfor man's reading,\" patient study may resolve the problem contained in\r\nthese mysterious leaves.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the discovery of new members in the cluster of minor\r\nplanets, near the middle of the century, occurred the resolution of the\r\ngreat nebula in Orion. This startling achievement by Lord Rosse's\r\ntelescope was the signal for the abandonment of the nebular hypothesis\r\nby many of its former advocates. To the present writer, however, the\r\npartial resolution of a single nebula seemed hardly a sufficient reason\r\nfor its summary rejection. The question then arose whether any probable\r\ntest of Laplace's theory could be found in the solar system itself. The\r\ntrain of thought was somewhat as follows: Several new members have been\r\nfound in the zone of asteroids; its dimensions have been greatly\r\nextended, so that we can now assign no definite limits either to the\r\nring itself or to the number of its planets; if the nebular hypothesis\r\nbe true, the sun, after Jupiter's separation, extended successively to\r\nthe various decreasing distances of the several asteroids; the\r\neccentricities of these bodies are generally greater than those of the\r\nold planets; this difference is probably due to the disturbing force of\r\nJupiter; the zone includes several distances at which the periods of\r\nasteroids would be commensurable with that of Jupiter; in such case the\r\nconjunctions of the minor with the major planet would occur in the same\r\nparts of its path, the disturbing effects would accumulate, and the\r\neccentricity would become very marked; such bodies in perihelion would\r\nreturn to the sun, and hence blanks or chasms would be formed in\r\nparticular parts of the zone. On the other hand, if the nebular\r\nhypothesis was not true, the occurrence of these gaps was not to be\r\nexpected. Having thus pointed out a prospective test of the theory, it\r\nwas announced with some hesitation that _those parts of the asteroid\r\nzone in which a simple relation of commensurability would obtain between\r\nthe period of a minor planet and that of Jupiter are distinguished as\r\ngaps or chasms similar to the interval in Saturn's ring_.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these blanks was thus predicted in theory before it was\r\nestablished as a fact of observation. When the law was first publicly\r\nstated in 1866, but ten asteroids had been found with distances greater\r\nthan three times that of the earth. The number of such now known is\r\nsixty-five. For more than a score of years the progress of discovery\r\nhas been watched with lively interest, and the one hundred and eighty\r\nnew members of the group have been found moving in harmony with this law\r\nof distribution.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENSURABILITY OF PERIODS.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that an asteroid's period is commensurable with that of\r\nJupiter, we mean that a certain whole number of the former is equal to\r\nanother whole number of the latter. For instance, if a minor planet\r\ncompletes two revolutions to Jupiter's one, or five to Jupiter's two,\r\nthe periods are commensurable. It must be remarked, however, that\r\nJupiter's effectiveness in disturbing the motion of a minor planet\r\ndepends on the _order_ of commensurability. Thus, if the ratio of the\r\nless to the greater period is expressed by the fraction 1/2, where the\r\ndifference between the numerator and the denominator is one, the\r\ncommensurability is of the first order; 1/3 is of the second; 2/5, of\r\nthe third, etc. The difference between the terms of the ratio indicates\r\nthe frequency of conjunctions while Jupiter is completing the number\r\nof revolutions expressed by the numerator. The distance 3.277,\r\ncorresponding to the ratio 1/2, is the only case of the first order in\r\nthe entire ring; those of the second order, answering to 1/3 and 3/5,\r\nare 2.50 and 3.70. These orders of commensurability may be thus arranged\r\nin a tabular form, the radius of the earth's orbit being the unit of\r\ndistance:\r\n\r\n +--------+----------------+-----------+\r\n | Order. |     Ratio.     | Distance. |\r\n +--------+----------------+-----------+\r\n | First  |      1/2       |   3.277   |\r\n |        |                |           |\r\n | Second |    1/3, 3/5    | { 2.50    |\r\n |        |                | { 3.70    |\r\n |        |                |           |\r\n |        |                | { 2.82    |\r\n | Third  |  2/5, 4/7, 5/8 | { 3.58    |\r\n |        |                | { 3.80    |\r\n |        |                |           |\r\n |        |                | { 2.95    |\r\n | Fourth | 3/7, 5/9, 7/11 | { 3.51    |\r\n |        |                | { 3.85    |\r\n +--------+----------------+-----------+\r\n\r\nDo these parts of the ring present discontinuities? and, if so, can they\r\nbe ascribed to a chance distribution? Let us consider them in order.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--The Distance 3.277.\r\n\r\nAt this distance an asteroid's conjunctions with Jupiter would all occur\r\nat the same place, and its perturbations would be there repeated at\r\nintervals equal to Jupiter's period (11.86 y.). Now, when the asteroids\r\nare arranged in the order of their mean distances (as in Table II.) this\r\npart of the zone presents a wide chasm. The space between 3.218 and\r\n3.376 remains, hitherto a perfect blank, while the adjacent portions of\r\nequal breadth, interior and exterior, contain fifty-four minor planets.\r\nThe probability that this distribution is not the result of chance is\r\nmore than three hundred billions to one.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of this chasm is one-twentieth part of its distance from the\r\nsun, or one-eleventh part of the breadth of the entire zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The Second Order of Commensurability.--The Distances 2.50 and 3.70.\r\n\r\nAt the former of these distances an asteroid's period would be one-third\r\nof Jupiter's, and at the latter, three-fifths. That part of the zone\r\nincluded between the distances 2.30 and 2.70 contains one hundred and\r\nten intervals, exclusive of the maximum at the critical distance 2.50.\r\nThis gap--between Thetis and Hestia--is not only much greater than any\r\nother of this number, but is more than sixteen times greater than their\r\naverage. The distance 3.70 falls in the wide hiatus interior to the\r\norbit of Ismene.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Chasms corresponding to the Third Order.--The Distances 2.82,\r\n3.58, and 3.80.\r\n\r\nAs the order of commensurability becomes less simple, the corresponding\r\nbreaks in the zone are less distinctly marked. In the present case\r\nconjunctions with Jupiter would occur at angular intervals of 120°. The\r\ngaps, however, are still easily perceptible. Between the distances 2.765\r\nand 2.808 we find twenty minor planets. In the next exterior space of\r\nequal breadth, containing the distance 2.82, there is but one. This is\r\nNo. 188, Menippe, whose elements are still somewhat uncertain. The space\r\nbetween 2.851 and 2.894--that is, the part of equal extent immediately\r\nbeyond the gap--contains thirteen asteroids. The distances 3.58 and 3.80\r\nare in the chasm between Andromache and Ismene.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--The Distances 2.95, 3.51,[10] and 3.85, corresponding to the Fourth\r\nOrder of Commensurability.\r\n\r\nThe first of these distances is in the interval between Psyche and\r\nClytemnestra; the second and third, in that exterior to Andromache.\r\n\r\nThe nine cases considered are the only ones in which the conjunctions\r\nwith Jupiter would occur at less than five points of an asteroid's\r\norbit. Higher orders of commensurability may perhaps be neglected. It\r\nwill be seen, however, that the distances 2.25, 2.70, 3.03, and 3.23,\r\ncorresponding to the ratios of the fifth order, 2/7, 3/8, 4/9, and 6/11,\r\nstill afford traces of Jupiter's influence. The first is in the interval\r\nbetween Augusta and Feronia; the last falls in the same gap with 3.277;\r\nand the second and third are in breaks less distinctly marked. It may\r\nalso be worthy of notice that the rather wide interval between Prymno\r\nand Victoria is where ten periods of a minor planet would be equal to\r\nthree of Jupiter. The distance of Medusa is somewhat uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe FACT of the existence of well-defined gaps in the designated parts\r\nof the ring has been clearly established. But the theory of probability\r\napplied in a single instance gives, as we have seen, but one chance in\r\n300,000,000,000 that the distribution is accidental. This improbability\r\nis increased many millions of times when we include all the gaps\r\ncorresponding to simple cases of commensurability. We conclude,\r\ntherefore, that those discontinuities cannot be referred to a chance\r\narrangement. What, then, was their physical cause? and what has become\r\nof the eliminated asteroids?\r\n\r\nWhat was said in regard to the limits of perihelion distance may suggest\r\na possible answer to these interesting questions. The doctrine of the\r\nsun's gradual contraction is now accepted by a majority of astronomers.\r\nAccording to this theory the solar radius at an epoch not relatively\r\nremote was twice what it is at present. At anterior stages it was 0.4,\r\n1.0, 2.0,[11] etc. At the first mentioned the comets of 1843 and 1668,\r\nas well as several others, could not have been moving in their present\r\norbits, since in perihelion they must have plunged into the sun. At the\r\nsecond, Encke's comet and all others with perihelia within Mercury's\r\norbit would have shared a similar fate. At the last named all asteroids\r\nwith perihelion distances less than two would have been re-incorporated\r\nwith the central mass. As the least distance of Æthra is but 1.587, its\r\norbit could not have had its present form and dimensions when the radius\r\nof the solar nebula was equal to the aphelion distance of Mars (1.665).\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see, therefore, that in those parts of the ring where\r\nJupiter would produce extraordinary disturbance the formation of chasms\r\nwould be very highly probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Relations between certain Adjacent Orbits.\r\n\r\nThe distances, periods, inclinations, and eccentricities of Hilda and\r\nIsmene, the outermost pair of the group, are very nearly identical. It\r\nis a remarkable fact, however, that the longitudes of their perihelia\r\ndiffer by almost exactly 180°. Did they separate at nearly the same\r\ntime from opposite sides of the solar nebula? Other adjacent pairs\r\nhaving a striking similarity between their orbital elements are Sirona\r\nand Ceres, Fides and Maia, Fortuna and Eurynome, and perhaps a few\r\nothers. Such coincidences can hardly be accidental. Original asteroids,\r\nsoon after their detachment from the central body, may have been\r\nseparated by the sun's unequal attraction on their parts. Such divisions\r\nhave occurred in the world of comets, why not also in the cluster of\r\nminor planets?\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The Eccentricities.\r\n\r\nThe least eccentric orbit in the group is that of Philomela (196); the\r\nmost eccentric that of Æthra (132). Comparing these with the orbit of\r\nthe second comet of 1867 we have\r\n\r\n The eccentricity of                     Philomela = 0.01\r\n  \"        \"      \"                          Æthra = 0.38\r\n  \"        \"      \"  Comet II. 1867 (ret. in 1885) = 0.41\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Æthra, it is seen, more nearly resembles the last than the\r\nfirst. It might perhaps be called the connecting-link between planetary\r\nand cometary orbits.\r\n\r\nThe average eccentricity of the two hundred and sixty-eight asteroids\r\nwhose orbits have been calculated is 0.1569. As with the orbits of the\r\nold planets, the eccentricities vary within moderate limits, some\r\nincreasing, others diminishing. The average, however, will probably\r\nremain very nearly the same. An inspection of the table shows that while\r\nbut one orbit is less eccentric than the earth's, sixty-nine depart more\r\nfrom the circular form than the orbit of Mercury. These eccentricities\r\nseem to indicate that the forms of the asteroidal orbits were influenced\r\nby special causes. It may be worthy of remark that the eccentricity does\r\nnot appear to vary with the distance from the sun, being nearly the same\r\nfor the interior members of the zone as for the exterior.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The Inclinations.\r\n\r\nThe inclinations in Table II. are thus distributed:\r\n\r\n From 0° to  4°    70\r\n  \"   4° to  8°    83\r\n  \"   8° to 12°    59\r\n  \"  12° to 16°    32\r\n  \"  16° to 20°     8\r\n  \"  20° to 24°     8\r\n  \"  24° to 28°     7\r\n  \"  28° to 32°     0\r\n above 32°          1\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty-four, considerably more than half, have\r\ninclinations between 3° and 11°, and the mean of the whole number is\r\nabout 8°,--slightly greater than the inclination of Mercury, or that of\r\nthe plane of the sun's equator. The smallest inclination, that of\r\nMassalia, is 0° 41´, and the largest, that of Pallas, is about 35°.\r\nSixteen minor planets, or six per cent. of the whole number, have\r\ninclinations exceeding 20°. Does any relation obtain between high\r\ninclinations and great eccentricities? These elements in the cases named\r\nabove are as follows:\r\n\r\n +------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n | Asteroid.  | Inclination. | Eccentricity.|\r\n +------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n | Pallas     |  34°   42´   |    0.238     |\r\n | Istria     |  26    30    |    0.353     |\r\n | Euphrosyne |  26    29    |    0.228     |\r\n | Anna       |  25    24    |    0.263     |\r\n | Gallia     |  25    21    |    0.185     |\r\n | Æthra      |  25     0    |    0.380     |\r\n | Eukrate    |  24    57    |    0.236     |\r\n | Eva        |  24    25    |    0.347     |\r\n | Niobe      |  23    19    |    0.173     |\r\n | Eunice     |  23    17    |    0.129     |\r\n | Electra    |  22    55    |    0.208     |\r\n | Idunna     |  22    31    |    0.164     |\r\n | Phocea     |  21    35    |    0.255     |\r\n | Artemis    |  21    31    |    0.175     |\r\n | Bertha     |  20    59    |    0.085     |\r\n | Henrietta  |  20    47    |    0.260     |\r\n +------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nThis comparison shows the most inclined orbits to be also very\r\neccentric; Bertha and Eunice being the only exceptions in the foregoing\r\nlist. On the other hand, however, we find over fifty asteroids with\r\neccentricities exceeding 0.20 whose inclinations are not extraordinary.\r\nThe dependence of the phenomena on a common cause can, therefore, hardly\r\nbe admitted. At least, the forces which produced the great eccentricity\r\nfailed in a majority of cases to cause high inclinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Longitudes of the Perihelia.\r\n\r\nThe perihelia of the asteroidal orbits are very unequally distributed;\r\none hundred and thirty-six--a majority of the whole number\r\ndetermined--being within the 120° from longitude 290° 50´ to 59° 50´.\r\nThe maximum occurs between 30° and 60°, where thirty-five perihelia are\r\nfound in 30° of longitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Distribution of the Ascending Nodes.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the column containing the longitudes of the ascending\r\nnodes, in Table II., indicates two well-marked maxima, each extending\r\nabout sixty degrees, in opposite parts of the heavens.\r\n\r\n  I. From 310° to  10°, containing 61 ascending nodes.\r\n II.   \"  120° to 180°,      \"     59     \"       \"\r\n                                  ---\r\n     Making in 120°               120     \"       \"\r\n\r\nA uniform distribution would give 89. An arc of 84°--from 46° to\r\n130°--contains the ascending nodes of all the old planets. This arc, it\r\nwill be noticed, is not coincident with either of the maxima found for\r\nthe asteroids.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. The Periods.\r\n\r\nSince, according to Kepler's third law, the periods of planets depend\r\nupon their mean distances, the clustering tendency found in the latter\r\nmust obtain also in the former. This marked irregularity in the order of\r\nperiods is seen below.\r\n\r\n Between 1100 and 1200 days     6 periods.\r\n     \"   1200  \"  1300   \"      7    \"\r\n     \"   1300  \"  1400   \"     43    \"\r\n     \"   1400  \"  1500   \"     13    \"\r\n     \"   1500  \"  1600   \"     46    \"\r\n     \"   1600  \"  1700   \"     54    \"\r\n     \"   1700  \"  1800   \"     20    \"\r\n     \"   1800  \"  1900   \"     13    \"\r\n     \"   1900  \"  2000   \"     19    \"\r\n     \"   2000  \"  2100   \"     33    \"\r\n     \"   2100  \"  2200   \"      2    \"\r\n     \"   2200  \"  2300   \"      2    \"\r\n     \"   2300  \"  2400   \"      8    \"\r\n     \"   2400  \"  2800   \"      0    \"\r\n     \"   2800  \"  2900   \"      2    \"\r\n\r\nThe period of Hilda (153) is more than two and a half times that of\r\nMedusa (149). This is greater than the ratio of Saturn's period to that\r\nof Jupiter. The maximum observed between 2000 and 2100 days corresponds\r\nto the space immediately interior to chasm I. on a previous page, that\r\nbetween 1300 and 1400 to the space interior to the second, and that\r\nbetween 1500 and 1700 to the part of the zone within the fourth gap. The\r\ntable presents quite numerous instances of approximate equality; in\r\nforty-three cases the periods differing less than twenty-four hours. It\r\nis impossible to say, however, whether any two of these periods are\r\n_exactly_ equal. In cases of a very close approach two asteroids,\r\nnotwithstanding their small mass, may exert upon each other quite\r\nsensible perturbations.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Origin of the Asteroids.\r\n\r\nBut four minor planets had been discovered when Laplace issued his last\r\nedition of the \"Système du Monde.\" The author, in his celebrated seventh\r\nnote in the second volume of that work, explained the origin of these\r\nbodies by assuming that the primitive ring from which they were formed,\r\ninstead of collecting into a single sphere, as in the case of the major\r\nplanets, broke up into four distinct masses. But the form and extent of\r\nthe cluster as now known, as well as the observed facts bearing on the\r\nconstitution of Saturn's ring, seem to require a modification of\r\nLaplace's theory. Throughout the greater part of the interval between\r\nMars and Jupiter an almost continuous succession of small planetary\r\nmasses--not nebulous rings--appears to have been abandoned at the solar\r\nequator. The entire cluster, distributed throughout a space whose outer\r\nradius exceeds the inner by more than two hundred millions of miles,\r\ncould not have originated, as supposed by Laplace, in a single nebulous\r\nzone the different parts of which revolved with the same angular\r\nvelocity. The following considerations may furnish a suggestion in\r\nregard to the mode in which these bodies were separated from the equator\r\nof the solar nebula.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The perihelion distance of Jupiter is 4.950, while the aphelion\r\ndistance of Hilda is 4.623. If, therefore, the sun once extended to the\r\nlatter, the central attraction of its mass on an equatorial particle was\r\nbut five times greater than Jupiter's perihelion influence on the same.\r\nIt is easy to see, then, that this \"giant planet\" would produce enormous\r\ntidal elevations in the solar mass.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The centrifugal force would be greatest at the crest of this tidal\r\nwave.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Three periods of solar revolution were then about equal to two\r\nperiods of Jupiter. The disturbing influence of the planet would\r\ntherefore be increased at each conjunction with this protuberance. The\r\nultimate separation (not of a ring but) of a planetary mass would be the\r\nprobable result of these combined and accumulating forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Variability of Certain Asteroids.\r\n\r\nObservations of some minor planets have indicated a variation of their\r\napparent magnitudes. Frigga, discovered by Dr. Peters in 1862, was\r\nobserved at the next opposition in 1864; but after this it could not be\r\nfound till 1868, when it was picked up by Professor Tietjen. From the\r\nlatter date its light seems again to have diminished, as all efforts to\r\nre-observe it were unsuccessful till 1879. According to Dr. Peters, the\r\nchange in brightness during the period of observation in that year was\r\ngreater than that due to its varying distance. No explanation of such\r\nchanges has yet been offered. It has been justly remarked, however, that\r\n\"the length of the period of the fluctuation does not allow of our\r\nconnecting it with the rotation of the planet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n13. The Average Asteroid Orbit.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience in 1884, Professor Mark W. Harrington, of Ann Arbor, Michigan,\r\npresented a paper in which the elements of the asteroid system were\r\nconsidered on the principle of averages. Two hundred and thirty orbits,\r\nall that had then been determined, were employed in the discussion.\r\nProfessor Harrington supposes two planes to intersect the ecliptic at\r\nright angles; one passing through the equinoxes and the other through\r\nthe solstices. These planes will intersect the asteroidal orbits, each\r\nin four points, and \"the mean intersection at each solstice and equinox\r\nmay be considered a point in the average orbit.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the Royal Academy of Denmark offered its gold medal for a\r\nstatistical examination of the orbits of the small planets considered as\r\nparts of a ring around the sun. The prize was awarded in 1885 to M.\r\nSvedstrup, of Copenhagen. The results obtained by these astronomers\r\nseverally are as follows:\r\n\r\n +-----------------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n |                             | Harrington. | Svedstrup. |\r\n +-----------------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n | Longitude of perihelion     |   14° 39´   | 101° 48´   |\r\n |     \"     of ascending node |  113  56    | 133  27    |\r\n | Inclination                 |    1   0    |   6   6    |\r\n | Eccentricity                |   0.0448    | 0.0281     |\r\n | Mean distance               |   2.7010    | 2.6435     |\r\n +-----------------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThese elements, with the exception of the first, are in reasonable\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. The Relation of Short-Period Comets to the Zone of Asteroids.\r\n\r\nDid comets originate within the solar system, or do they enter it from\r\nwithout? Laplace assigned them an extraneous origin, and his view is\r\nadopted by many eminent astronomers. With all due respect to the\r\nauthority of great names, the present writer has not wholly abandoned\r\nthe theory that some comets of short period are specially related to the\r\nminor planets. According to M. Lehmann-Filhès, the eccentricity of the\r\nthird comet of 1884, before its last close approach to Jupiter, was only\r\n0.2787.[12] This is exceeded by that of twelve known minor planets. Its\r\nmean distance before this great perturbation was about 4.61, and six of\r\nits periods were nearly equal to five of Jupiter's,--a commensurability\r\nof the first order. According to Hind and Krueger, the great\r\ntransformation of its orbit by Jupiter's influence occurred in May,\r\n1875. It had previously been an asteroid too remote to be seen even in\r\nperihelion. This body was discovered by M. Wolf, at Heidelberg,\r\nSeptember 17, 1884. Its present period is about six and one-half years.\r\n\r\nThe perihelion distance of the comet 1867 II. at its return in 1885 was\r\n2.073; its aphelion is 4.897; so that its entire path, like those of the\r\nasteroids, is included between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its\r\neccentricity, as we have seen, is little greater than that of Æthra, and\r\nits period, inclination, and longitude of the ascending node are\r\napproximately the same with those of Sylvia, the eighty-seventh minor\r\nplanet. In short, this comet may be regarded as an asteroid whose\r\nelements have been considerably modified by perturbation.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the gap at the distance 3.277 is the only one\r\ncorresponding to the first order of commensurability. The distance\r\n3.9683, where an asteroid's period would be two-thirds of Jupiter's, is\r\nimmediately beyond the outer limit of the cluster as at present known;\r\nthe mean distance of Hilda being 3.9523. The discovery of new members\r\nbeyond this limit is by no means improbable. Should a minor planet at\r\nthe mean distance 3.9683 attain an eccentricity of 0.3--and this is less\r\nthan that of eleven now known--its aphelion would be more remote than\r\nthe perihelion of Jupiter. Such an orbit might not be stable. Its form\r\nand extent might be greatly changed after the manner of Lexell's comet.\r\nTwo well-known comets, Faye's and Denning's, have periods approximately\r\nequal to two-thirds of Jupiter's. In like manner the periods of\r\nD'Arrest's and Biela's comets correspond to the hiatus at 3.51, and that\r\nof 1867 II. to that at 3.277.\r\n\r\nOf the thirteen telescopic comets whose periods correspond to mean\r\ndistances within the asteroid zone, all have direct motion; all have\r\ninclinations similar to those of the minor planets; and their\r\neccentricities are generally less than those of other known comets. Have\r\nthese facts any significance in regard to their origin?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\nTHE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF ASTEROIDS IN UNDISCOVERED RINGS.\r\n\r\nIf Jupiter's influence was a factor in the separation of planetules at\r\nthe sun's equator, may not similar clusters exist in other parts of our\r\nsystem? The hypothesis is certainly by no means improbable. For anything\r\nwe know to the contrary a group may circulate between Jupiter and\r\nSaturn; such bodies, however, could not be discovered--at least not by\r\nordinary telescopes--on account of their distance. The Zodiacal Light,\r\nit has been suggested, may be produced by a cloud of indefinitely small\r\nparticles related to the planets between the sun and Mars. The rings of\r\nSaturn are merely a dense asteroidal cluster; and, finally, the\r\nphenomena of luminous meteors indicate the existence of small masses of\r\nmatter moving with different velocities in interstellar space.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE B.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN AND STRUCTURE OF COSMICAL RINGS.\r\n\r\nThe general theory of cosmical rings and of their arrangement in\r\nsections or clusters with intervening chasms may be briefly stated in\r\nthe following propositions:\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWhenever the separating force of a primary body on a secondary or\r\nsatellite is greater than the central attraction of the latter on its\r\nsuperficial stratum, the satellite, if either gaseous or liquid, will be\r\ntransformed into a ring.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.--Saturn's ring, and the meteoric rings of April 20, August 10,\r\nNovember 14, and November 27.\r\n\r\nSee Payne's _Sidereal Messenger_, April, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWhen a cosmical body is surrounded by a ring of considerable breadth,\r\nand has also exterior satellites at such distances that a simple\r\nrelation of commensurability would obtain between the periods of these\r\nsatellites and those of certain particles of the ring, the disturbing\r\ninfluence of the former will produce gaps or intervals in the ring so\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nSee \"Meteoric Astronomy,\" Chapter XII.; also the _Proceedings of the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society_, October 6, 1871; and the _Sidereal\r\nMessenger_ for February, 1884; where the papers referred to assign a\r\nphysical cause for the gaps in Saturn's ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The discoverer, Piazzi, was not, as has been so often affirmed, one\r\nof the astronomers to whom the search had been especially committed.\r\n\r\n[2] Massalia was discovered by De Gasparis, at Naples, Sept. 19, 1852,\r\nand independently, the next night, by Chacornac, at Marseilles. The name\r\nwas given by the latter.\r\n\r\n[3] Astr. Nach., No. 932.\r\n\r\n[4] Monthly Notices, vol. xxvii.\r\n\r\n[5] Annals of the Obs. of Harv. Coll., 1879.\r\n\r\n[6] This ingenious idea may be readily extended. The least distance of\r\nÆthra is less than the present aphelion distance of Mars; and the\r\nmaximum aphelion distance of the latter exceeds the perihelion distance\r\nof several known asteroids. Moreover, if we represent the orbits of the\r\nmajor planets, and also those of the comets of known periods, by\r\nmaterial rings, it is easy to see that the major as well as the minor\r\nplanets are all linked together in the manner suggested by D'Arrest.\r\n\r\n[7] The effects of Jupiter's disturbing influence will again be resumed.\r\n\r\n[8] Not only nebulæ are probably unstable, but also many of the sidereal\r\nsystems. The Milky Way itself was so regarded by Sir William Herschel.\r\n\r\n[9] Menippe, No. 188, is placed in one of the gaps by its calculated\r\nelements; but the fact that it has not been seen since the year of its\r\ndiscovery, 1878, indicates a probable error in its elements.\r\n\r\n[10] The minor planet Andromache, immediately interior to the critical\r\ndistance 3.51, has elements somewhat remarkable. With two exceptions,\r\nÆthra (132) and Istria (183), it has the greatest eccentricity\r\n(0.3571),--nearly equal to that of the comet 1867 II. at its last\r\nreturn. Its perihelion distance is 2.2880, its aphelion 4.7262; hence\r\nthe distance from the perihelion to the aphelion of its orbit is greater\r\nthan its least distance from the sun, and it crosses the orbits of all\r\nmembers of the group so far as known; its least distance from the sun\r\nbeing considerably less than the aphelion of Medusa, and its greatest\r\nexceeding the aphelion of Hilda.\r\n\r\n[11] The unit being the sun's distance from the earth.\r\n\r\n[12] Annuaire, 1886.",
