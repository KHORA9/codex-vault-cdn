The review of his published works will, I\r\ntrust, be of use. It is based upon a careful study of all his papers in\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_ and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA life of HERSCHEL which shall be satisfactory in every particular can\r\nonly be written after a full examination of the materials which are\r\npreserved at the family seat in England; but as two generations have\r\npassed since his death, and as no biography yet exists which approaches\r\nto completeness, no apology seems to me to be needed for a\r\nconscientious attempt to make the best use of the scanty material which\r\nwe do possess.\r\n\r\nThis study will, I trust, serve to exhibit so much of his life as\r\nbelongs to the whole public. His private life belongs to his family,\r\nuntil the time is come to let the world know more of the greatest of\r\npractical astronomers and of the inner life of one of its most profound\r\nphilosophers,--of a great and ardent mind, whose achievements are and\r\nwill remain the glory of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PAGE\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEARLY YEARS; 1738-1772,                              1\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN BATH; 1772-1782,                            33\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLIFE AT DATCHET, CLAY HALL, AND SLOUGH; 1782-1822,  68\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC LABORS OF HERSCHEL,       118\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY,                                      215\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF NAMES,                                    235\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AND WORKS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEARLY YEARS; 1738-1772.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the great modern philosophers, that one of whom least is known, is\r\nWILLIAM HERSCHEL. We may appropriate the words which escaped him when\r\nthe barren region of the sky near the body of _Scorpio_ was passing\r\nslowly through the field of his great reflector, during one of his\r\nsweeps, to express our own sense of absence of light and knowledge:\r\n_Hier ist wahrhaftig ein Loch im Himmel._\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL prepared, about the year 1818, a biographical memorandum, which\r\nhis sister CAROLINA placed among his papers.\r\n\r\nThis has never been made public. The only thoroughly authentic sources\r\nof information in possession of the world, are a letter written by\r\nHERSCHEL himself, in answer to a pressing request for a sketch of his\r\nlife, and the _Memoir and Correspondence of CAROLINE HERSCHEL_ (London,\r\n1876), a precious memorial not only of his life, but of one which\r\notherwise would have remained almost unknown, and one, too, which the\r\nworld could ill afford to lose. The latter, which has been ably edited\r\nby Mrs. MARY CORNWALLIS HERSCHEL,[1] is the only source of knowledge in\r\nregard to the early years of the great astronomer, and together with the\r\nall too scanty materials to be gained from a diligent search through the\r\nbiography of the time, affords the data for those personal details of\r\nhis life, habits, and character, which seem to complete the distinct,\r\nthough partial conception of him which the student of his philosophical\r\nwritings acquires.\r\n\r\nThe letter referred to was published in the Göttingen Magazine of\r\nScience and Literature, III., 4, shortly after the name of HERSCHEL had\r\nbecome familiar to every ear through his discovery of _Uranus_, but\r\nwhile the circumstances of the discovery, and the condition of the\r\namateur who made it, were still entirely unknown.\r\n\r\nThe editor (LICHTENBERG) says:\r\n\r\n    \"Herr HERSCHEL was good enough to send me, some time since, through\r\n    Herr MAGELLAN, copies of his Dissertations on Double Stars, on the\r\n    Parallax of the Fixed Stars, and on a new Micrometer. In the letter\r\n    which conveyed to him my thanks for his gift, I requested him to\r\n    note down a few facts in regard to his life, for publication in this\r\n    magazine, since various accounts, more or less incorrect, had\r\n    appeared in several journals. In answer, I received a very obliging\r\n    letter from him and what follows is that portion of it relating to\r\n    my request, which was sent me with full permission to make it\r\n    public.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                \"DATCHET, NEAR WINDSOR,\r\n                                                _Nov. 15, 1783._\r\n\r\n    \"I was born in Hanover, November, 1738. My father, who was a\r\n    musician, destined me to the same profession, hence I was\r\n    instructed betimes in his art. That I might acquire a perfect\r\n    knowledge of the theory as well as of the practice of music, I was\r\n    set at an early age to study mathematics in all its\r\n    branches--algebra, conic sections, infinitesimal analysis, and the\r\n    rest.\r\n\r\n    \"The insatiable desire for knowledge thus awakened resulted next in\r\n    a course of languages; I learned French, English, and Latin, and\r\n    steadfastly resolved henceforth to devote myself wholly to those\r\n    sciences from the pursuit of which I alone looked for all my future\r\n    happiness and enjoyment. I have never been either necessitated or\r\n    disposed to alter this resolve. My father, whose means were limited,\r\n    and who consequently could not be as liberal to his children as he\r\n    would have desired, was compelled to dispose of them in one way or\r\n    another at an early age; consequently in my fifteenth year I\r\n    enlisted in military service, only remaining in the army, however,\r\n    until I reached my nineteenth year, when I resigned and went over to\r\n    England.\r\n\r\n    \"My familiarity with the organ, which I had carefully mastered\r\n    previously, soon procured for me the position of organist in\r\n    Yorkshire, which I finally exchanged for a similar situation at Bath\r\n    in 1766, and while here the peculiar circumstances of my post, as\r\n    agreeable as it was lucrative, made it possible for me to occupy\r\n    myself once more with my studies, especially with mathematics. When,\r\n    in the course of time, I took up astronomy, I determined to accept\r\n    nothing on faith, but to see with my own eyes everything which\r\n    others had seen before me. Having already some knowledge of the\r\n    science of optics, I resolved to manufacture my own telescopes, and\r\n    after many continuous, determined trials, I finally succeeded in\r\n    completing a so-called Newtonian instrument, seven feet in length.\r\n    From this I advanced to one of ten feet, and at last to one of\r\n    twenty, for I had fully made up my mind to carry on the improvement\r\n    of my telescopes as far as it could possibly be done. When I had\r\n    carefully and thoroughly perfected the great instrument in all its\r\n    parts, I made systematic use of it in my observations of the\r\n    heavens, first forming a determination never to pass by any, the\r\n    smallest, portion of them without due investigation. This habit,\r\n    persisted in, led to the discovery of the new planet (_Georgium\r\n    Sidus_). This was by no means the result of chance, but a simple\r\n    consequence of the position of the planet on that particular\r\n    evening, since it occupied precisely that spot in the heavens which\r\n    came in the order of the minute observations that I had previously\r\n    mapped out for myself. Had I not seen it just when I did, I must\r\n    inevitably have come upon it soon after, since my telescope was so\r\n    perfect that I was able to distinguish it from a fixed star in the\r\n    first minute of observation.\r\n\r\n    \"Now to bring this sketch to a close. As the king had expressed a\r\n    desire to see my telescope, I took it by his command to Greenwich,\r\n    where it was compared with the instruments of my excellent friend,\r\n    Dr. MASKELYNE, not only by himself, but by other experts, who\r\n    pronounced it as their opinion that my instrument was superior to\r\n    all the rest. Thereupon the king ordered that the instrument be\r\n    brought to Windsor, and since it there met with marked approval, his\r\n    majesty graciously awarded me a yearly pension, that I might be\r\n    enabled to relinquish my profession of music, and devote my whole\r\n    time to astronomy and the improvement of the telescope. Gratitude,\r\n    as well as other considerations specified by me in a paper presented\r\n    to the Royal Society, of which I am a member, has induced me to call\r\n    the new planet _Georgium Sidus_.\r\n\r\n        \"'Georgium Sidus.--jam nunc assuesce vocari.'--(_Virgil._)\r\n\r\n    And I hope it will retain the name.\"\r\n\r\nWe know but little of the family of HERSCHEL. The name is undoubtedly\r\nJewish, and is found in Poland, Germany, and England. We learn that the\r\nancestors of the present branch left Moravia about the beginning of the\r\nXVIIth century, on account of their change of religion to Protestantism.\r\nThey became possessors of land in Saxony. HANS HERSCHEL, the\r\ngreat-grandfather of WILLIAM, was a brewer in Pirna (a small town near\r\nDresden). Of the two sons of HANS, one, ABRAHAM (born in 1651, died\r\n1718), was employed in the royal gardens at Dresden, and seems to have\r\nbeen a man of taste and skill in his calling. Of his eldest son,\r\nEUSEBIUS, there appears to be little trace in the records of the family.\r\nThe second son, BENJAMIN, died in infancy; the third, ISAAC, was born in\r\n1707 (Jan. 14), and was thus an orphan at eleven years of age. ISAAC was\r\nthe father of the great astronomer.\r\n\r\nHe appears to have early had a passionate fondness for music, and this,\r\nadded to a distaste for his father's calling, determined his career. He\r\nwas taught music by an oboe-player in the royal band, and he also\r\nlearned the violin. At the age of twenty-one he studied music for a year\r\nunder the Cappelmeister PABRICH, at Potsdam, and in August, 1731, he\r\nbecame oboist in the band of the Guards, at Hanover. In August, 1732, he\r\nmarried ANNA ILSE MORITZEN. She appears to have been a careful and busy\r\nwife and mother, possessed of no special faculties which would lead us\r\nto attribute to her care any great part of the abilities of her son.\r\nShe could not herself write the letters which she sent to her husband\r\nduring his absences with his regiment. It was her firm belief that the\r\nseparations and some of the sorrows of the family came from too much\r\nlearning; and while she could not hinder the education of the sons of\r\nthe family, she prevented their sisters from learning French and\r\ndancing. It is but just to say that the useful accomplishments of\r\ncooking, sewing, and the care of a household, were thoroughly taught by\r\nher to her two daughters. The father, ISAAC, appears to have been of a\r\ndifferent mould, and to him, no doubt, the chief intellectual\r\ncharacteristics of the family are due. His position obliged him to be\r\noften absent from Hanover, with his regiment, but his hand appears to\r\nhave been always present, smoothing over difficulties, and encouraging\r\nhis sons to such learning and improvement as was to be had.\r\n\r\nHis health was seriously injured by the exposures of the campaigns,\r\nand he was left, after the Seven Years' War, with a broken constitution.\r\n\r\nAfter his final return home, in 1760, his daughter gives this record of\r\nhim--\r\n\r\n    \"Copying music employed every vacant moment, even sometimes\r\n    throughout half the night. . . . With my brother [DIETRICH]--now a\r\n    little engaging creature of between four and five years old--he was\r\n    very much pleased, and [on the first evening of his arrival at home]\r\n    before he went to rest, the Adempken (a little violin) was taken\r\n    from the shelf and newly strung, and the daily lessons immediately\r\n    commenced. . . . I do not recollect that he ever desired any other\r\n    society than what he had opportunities of enjoying in many of the\r\n    parties where he was introduced by his profession, though far from\r\n    being of a morose disposition; he would frequently encourage my\r\n    mother in keeping up a social intercourse among a few acquaintances,\r\n    whilst his afternoon hours generally were taken up in giving lessons\r\n    to some scholars at home, who gladly saved him the troublesome\r\n    exertion of walking. . . . He also found great pleasure in seeing\r\n    DIETRICH'S improvement, who, young as he was, and of the most lively\r\n    temper imaginable, was always ready to receive his lessons, leaving\r\n    his little companions with the greatest cheerfulness to go to his\r\n    father, who was so pleased with his performances that he made him\r\n    play a solo on the Adempken in RAKE'S concert, being placed on a\r\n    table before a crowded company, for which he was very much applauded\r\n    and caressed, particularly by an English lady, who put a gold coin\r\n    in his little pocket.\r\n\r\n    \"It was not long before my father had as many scholars as he could\r\n    find time to attend. And when they assembled at my father's to make\r\n    little concerts, I was frequently called to join the second violin\r\n    in an overture, for my father found pleasure in giving me sometimes\r\n    a lesson before the instruments were laid by, after practising with\r\n    DIETRICH, for I never was missing at those hours, sitting in a\r\n    corner with my knitting and listening all the while.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as in all her writing, CAROLINA is simple, true, direct to\r\nawkwardness, and unconsciously pathetic even in joy.\r\n\r\nThe family of ISAAC and ANNA HERSCHEL consisted of ten children. Six of\r\nthese lived to adult age. They were:\r\n\r\n    1. SOPHIA ELIZABETH; born 1733, married GRIESBACH, a musician in the\r\n       Guard, by whom she had children. Five of her sons were afterwards\r\n       musicians at the court, in England, where they obtained places\r\n       through the influence of WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n    2. HENRY ANTON JACOB; born 1734, November 20.\r\n\r\n    4. FREDERIC WILLIAM (the astronomer) born 1738, November 15.\r\n\r\n    6. JOHN ALEXANDER; born 1745, November 13.\r\n\r\n    8. CAROLINA LUCRETIA; born 1750, March 16.\r\n\r\n    10. DIETRICH; born 1755, September 13.\r\n\r\nOf this family group, the important figures to us are WILLIAM,\r\nALEXANDER, and CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nJACOB was organist at the Garrison Church of Hanover in 1753, a member\r\nof the Guards' band in 1755, and first violin in the Hanover Court\r\nOrchestra in 1759. Afterwards he joined his brother WILLIAM in Bath, but\r\nagain returned to Hanover. In 1771 he published in Amsterdam his Opus\r\nI., a set of six quartettes, and later, in London, he published two\r\nsymphonies and six trios. He appears to have been a clever musician, and\r\nhis letters to his younger brother WILLIAM are full of discussion on\r\npoints of musical composition, etc. He died in 1792.\r\n\r\nDIETRICH, the youngest brother, shared in the musical abilities of his\r\nfamily, and when only fifteen years old was so far advanced as to be\r\nable to supply his brother JACOB'S place in the Court Orchestra, and to\r\ngive his lessons to private pupils. There is no one of the family,\r\nexcept the eldest daughter, whom we do not know to have possessed marked\r\nability in music, and this taste descended truly for four generations.\r\nIn the letters of Chevalier BUNSEN,[2] he describes meeting, in 1847,\r\nthe eldest granddaughter of WILLIAM HERSCHEL, who, he says, \"is a\r\nmusical genius.\"\r\n\r\nThree members of the family, WILLIAM, ALEXANDER, and CAROLINA, formed a\r\ngroup which was inseparable for many years, and while the progress of\r\nthe lives of ALEXANDER and CAROLINA was determined by the energy and\r\nefforts of WILLIAM, these two lent him an aid without which his career\r\nwould have been strangely different. It is necessary to understand a\r\nlittle better the early life of all three.\r\n\r\nThe sons of the HERSCHEL family all attended the garrison school in\r\nHanover until they were about fourteen years old. They were taught the\r\nordinary rudiments of knowledge--to read, to write, to cipher--and a\r\nknowledge of French and English was added. WILLIAM especially\r\ndistinguished himself in his studies, learning French very rapidly, and\r\nstudying Latin and arithmetic with his master out of hours. The\r\nhousehold life seems to have been active, harmonious, and intelligent,\r\nespecially during the presence of the father, who took a great delight\r\nin the rapid progress of all his sons in music, and who encouraged them\r\nwith his companionship in their studies and in their reading on all\r\nintellectual subjects.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Memoir_ of CAROLINA, on which we must depend for our\r\nknowledge of this early life, we take the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n    \"My brothers were often introduced as solo performers and assistants\r\n    in the orchestra of the court, and I remember that I was frequently\r\n    prevented from going to sleep by the lively criticism on music on\r\n    coming from a concert, or by conversations on philosophical subjects,\r\n    which lasted frequently till morning, in which my father was a\r\n    lively partaker and assistant of my brother WILLIAM, by contriving\r\n    self-made instruments. . . . Often I would keep myself awake that\r\n    I might listen to their animating remarks, for it made _me so happy_\r\n    to see _them so happy_. But generally their conversation would\r\n    branch out on philosophical subjects, when my brother WILLIAM and my\r\n    father often argued with such warmth that my mother's interference\r\n    became necessary, when the names LEIBNITZ, NEWTON, and EULER\r\n    sounded rather too loud for the repose of her little ones, who\r\n    ought to be in school by seven in the morning. But it seems that\r\n    on the brothers retiring to their own room, where they shared\r\n    the same bed, my brother WILLIAM had still a great deal to say; and\r\n    frequently it happened that when he stopped for an assent or reply,\r\n    he found his hearer was gone to sleep, and I suppose it was not till\r\n    then that he bethought himself to do the same.\r\n\r\n    \"The recollection of these happy scenes confirms me in the belief,\r\n    that had my brother WILLIAM not then been interrupted in his\r\n    philosophical pursuits, we should have had much earlier proofs of\r\n    his inventive genius. My father was a great admirer of astronomy,\r\n    and had some knowledge of that science; for I remember his taking\r\n    me, on a clear frosty night, into the street, to make me acquainted\r\n    with several of the most beautiful constellations, after we had been\r\n    gazing at a comet which was then visible. And I well remember with\r\n    what delight he used to assist my brother WILLIAM in his various\r\n    contrivances in the pursuit of his philosophical studies, among\r\n    which was a neatly turned 4-inch globe, upon which the equator and\r\n    ecliptic were engraved by my brother.\"\r\n\r\nThe mechanical genius was not confined to WILLIAM, for we read that\r\nALEXANDER used often to \"sit by us and amuse us and himself by making\r\nall sorts of things out of pasteboard, or contriving how to make a\r\ntwelve-hour cuckoo clock go a week.\" This ability of ALEXANDER'S was\r\nturned later to the best account when he became his brother WILLIAM'S\r\nright hand in the manufacture of reflectors, eye-pieces, and stands in\r\nEngland. His abilities were great, and a purpose which might otherwise\r\nhave been lacking was supplied through the younger brother's ardor in\r\nall that he undertook.\r\n\r\nHis musical talent was remarkable; he played \"divinely\" on the\r\nvioloncello. He returned to Hanover in 1816, where he lived in\r\ncomfortable independence, through the never-failing generosity of his\r\nbrother, until his death in 1821. A notice of him in a Bristol paper\r\nsays: \"Died, March 15, 1821, at Hanover, ALEXANDER HERSCHEL, Esqr., well\r\nknown to the public of Bath and Bristol as a performer and elegant\r\nmusician; and who for forty-seven years was the admiration of the\r\nfrequenters of concerts and theatres of both those cities as principal\r\nvioloncello. To the extraordinary merits of Mr. HERSCHEL was united\r\nconsiderable acquirement in the superior branches of mechanics and\r\nphilosophy, and his affinity to his brother, Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL, was\r\nnot less in science than in blood.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall learn more of the sister, CAROLINA, as time goes on. Now in\r\nthese early years she was a silent and persistent child, growing up with\r\na feeling that she was uncared for and neglected, and lavishing all her\r\nchildish affection, as she did all that of her womanly life, on her\r\nbrother WILLIAM. Throughout her long life, \"my brother\" was WILLIAM,\r\n\"my nephew\" _his_ son.\r\n\r\nThe brothers JACOB and WILLIAM were, with their father, members of the\r\nband of the Guards in 1755, when the regiment was ordered to England,\r\nand they were absent from Hanover a year.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM (then seventeen years old) went as oboist, and out of his\r\nscanty pay brought back to Hanover, in 1756, only one memento of his\r\nstay--a copy of LOCKE _On the Human Understanding_.\r\n\r\nHe appears to have served with the Guard during part of the campaign of\r\n1757. His health was then delicate, and his parents \"determined to\r\nremove him from the service--a step attended by no small\r\ndifficulties.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThis \"removal\" was hurriedly and safely effected, so hurriedly that the\r\ncopy of LOCKE was not put in the parcels sent after him to Hamburg by\r\nhis mother; \"she, dear woman, knew no other wants than good linen and\r\nclothing.\"\r\n\r\nThus, at last, the young WILLIAM HERSCHEL, the son of an oboe-player in\r\nthe King's Guard, is launched in life for himself, in the year 1757, at\r\nthe age of nineteen.\r\n\r\nAll his equipment is the \"good linen and clothing,\" a knowledge of\r\nFrench, Latin, and English, some skill in playing the violin, the organ,\r\nand the oboe, and an \"uncommon precipitancy\" in doing what there is to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nA slender outfit truly; but we are not to overlook what he said of\r\nhimself on another occasion. \"I have, nevertheless, several resources in\r\nview, and do not despair of succeeding pretty well in the end.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1757 to 1760--three years--we know nothing of his life. We can\r\nimagine what it was. His previous visit to England had given him a good\r\nknowledge of the language, and perhaps a few uninfluential\r\nacquaintances. On his return he would naturally seek these out, and, by\r\nmeans of his music, he could gain a livelihood. We first hear of him as\r\ncharged with the organization of the music of a corps of the militia of\r\nDurham, under the auspices of the EARL OF DARLINGTON. \"La manière dont\r\nil remplit cette mission, le fit connaître avantageusement.\"[4] The\r\nnature of the service of these militia corps, which were then forming\r\nall over England, is well described in the Autobiography of GIBBON.\r\nEvery county-gentleman felt constrained to serve his country,\r\nand the regimental mess-rooms were filled with men of rank and fashion.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 we hear of him again. He has attracted the notice of those about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n    \"About the year 1760, as MILLER[5] was dining at Pontefract with\r\n    the officers of the Durham militia, one of them, knowing his love of\r\n    music, told him they had a young German in their band as a performer\r\n    on the hautboy, who had only been a few months in England, and yet\r\n    spoke English almost as well as a native, and who was also an\r\n    excellent performer on the violin; the officer added that if MILLER\r\n    would come into another room, this German should entertain him with\r\n    a solo. The invitation was gladly accepted, and MILLER heard a solo\r\n    of GIARDINI'S executed in a manner that surprised him. He afterwards\r\n    took an opportunity of having some private conversation with the\r\n    young musician, and asked him whether he had engaged himself for any\r\n    long period to the Durham militia. The answer was, 'Only from month\r\n    to month.' 'Leave them, then,' said the organist, 'and come and live\r\n    with me. I am a single man, and think we shall be happy together;\r\n    and, doubtless, your merit will soon entitle you to a more eligible\r\n    situation.' The offer was accepted as frankly as it was made, and\r\n    the reader may imagine with what satisfaction Dr. MILLER\r\n    must have remembered this act of generous feeling when he hears\r\n    that this young German was HERSCHEL, the Astronomer. 'My humble\r\n    mansion,' says MILLER, 'consisted, at that time, but of two rooms.\r\n    However, poor as I was, my cottage contained a library of\r\n    well-chosen books; and it must appear singular that a foreigner who\r\n    had been so short a time in England should understand even the\r\n    peculiarities of the language so well as to fix upon SWIFT for his\r\n    favorite author.'\r\n\r\n    \"He took an early opportunity of introducing his new friend at\r\n    Mr. CROPLEY'S concerts; the first violin was resigned to him; 'and\r\n    never,' says the organist, 'had I heard the concertos of CORELLI,\r\n    GEMINIANI, and AVISON, or the overtures of HANDEL performed more\r\n    chastely, or more according to the original intention of the\r\n    composers, than by Mr. HERSCHEL. I soon lost my companion; his fame\r\n    was presently spread abroad; he had the offer of pupils, and was\r\n    solicited to lead the public concerts both at Wakefield and Halifax.\r\n    A new organ for the parish church of Halifax was built about this\r\n    time, and HERSCHEL was one of the seven candidates for the\r\n    organist's place. They drew lots how they were to perform in\r\n    succession. HERSCHEL drew the third, the second fell to Dr.\r\n    WAINWRIGHT of Manchester, whose finger was so rapid that old\r\n    SNETZLER, the organ-builder, ran about the church exclaiming:\r\n    '_Te tevel! te tevel! he run over te keys like one cat; he will\r\n    not give my piphes room for to shpeak._' 'During Mr. WAINWRIGHT'S\r\n    performance,' says MILLER, 'I was standing in the middle aisle with\r\n    HERSCHEL. 'What chance have you,' said I, 'to follow this man?' He\r\n    replied, 'I don't know; I am sure fingers will not do.' On which he\r\n    ascended the organ loft, and produced from the organ so uncommon a\r\n    fulness, such a volume of slow, solemn harmony, that I could by no\r\n    means account for the effect. After this short _ex tempore_\r\n    effusion, he finished with the Old Hundredth psalm-tune, which he\r\n    played better than his opponent.\r\n\r\n    \"'_Ay, ay_,' cried old SNETZLER, '_tish is very goot, very goot\r\n    indeet; I vil luf tish man, for he gives my piphes room for to\r\n    shpeak._' Having afterwards asked Mr. HERSCHEL by what means, in the\r\n    beginning of his performance, he produced so uncommon an effect, he\r\n    replied, 'I told you fingers would not do!' and producing two pieces\r\n    of lead from his waistcoat pocket, 'one of these,' said he,\r\n    'I placed on the lowest key of the organ, and the other upon the\r\n    octave above; thus by accommodating the harmony, I produced the\r\n    effect of four hands, instead of two.'\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe dates in this extract are not so well defined as might be wished.\r\nHERSCHEL had certainly been more than a few months in England at the\r\ntime of his meeting with Dr. MILLER, which was probably about 1760. The\r\nappointment as organist at Halifax was in 1765, and the pupils and\r\npublic concerts must have filled up the intervening five years. During a\r\npart of this time he lived in Leeds, with the family of Mr. BULMAN, whom\r\nhe afterwards provided with a place as clerk to the Octagon Chapel, in\r\nhis usual generous manner.\r\n\r\nAll during his life he was placing some of the less fortunate and\r\nenergetic members of his family.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be too grateful to Dr. MILLER, who, seeing his opportunity,\r\nused it. Their frank friendship does honor to both. HERSCHEL'S\r\norgan-playing, which no doubt had been begun when his brother was the\r\norganist of the garrison chapel at Hanover, must have been perfected at\r\nthis time, and it was through his organ-playing that he was able to\r\nleave the needy life in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nHe was sure to have emerged sooner or later, but every year spared to\r\nhim as a struggling musician was a year saved to Astronomy.\r\n\r\nDuring all this period, a constant correspondence was maintained\r\nbetween the family at Hanover and the absent son.\r\n\r\nMany of WILLIAM'S letters were written in English, and addressed to his\r\nbrother JACOB, and treated of such subjects as the Theory of Music, in\r\nwhich he was already far advanced.\r\n\r\nHis little sister was still faithful to the memory of her _dearest_\r\nbrother, and his father, whose health was steadily declining, became\r\npainfully eager for his return. In 1764 (April 2), he returned to\r\nHanover on a very brief visit. He was attached to England, he was\r\nprospering there, and he had no inclination towards returning to a life\r\nin Hanover. His sister says:\r\n\r\n    \"Of the joys and pleasures which all felt at this long-wished-for\r\n    meeting with my--let me say my _dearest_--brother, but a small\r\n    portion could fall to my share; for with my constant attendance at\r\n    church and school, besides the time I was employed in doing the\r\n    drudgery of the scullery, it was but seldom I could make one in the\r\n    group when the family were assembled together.\r\n\r\n    \"In the first week, some of the orchestra were invited to a concert,\r\n    at which some of my brother WILLIAM'S compositions, overtures, etc.,\r\n    and some of my eldest brother JACOB'S were performed, to the great\r\n    delight of my dear father, who hoped and expected that they would\r\n    be turned to some profit by publishing them, but there was no\r\n    printer who bid high enough.\r\n\r\n    \"Sunday, the 8th, was the--to me--eventful day of my confirmation,\r\n    and I left home not a little proud and encouraged by my dear brother\r\n    WILLIAM'S approbation of my appearance in my new gown.\"\r\n\r\nThe engagement of HERSCHEL at Halifax did not long continue. In 1766 he\r\nobtained an advantageous engagement as oboist at Bath, and soon after\r\nthe position of organist at the Octagon Chapel was offered to him and\r\naccepted. This was a great and important change.\r\n\r\nBath was then, as now, one of the most beautiful cities in England, and\r\nthe resort of the fashion and rank of the kingdom, who came to take the\r\nwaters. It is beautifully situated on both sides of the Avon, and has\r\nmany fine walks and public buildings. The aspect of the city is markedly\r\ncheerful and brilliant, owing to the nature of the white stone of which\r\nthe principal houses are built, and to the exquisite amphitheatre of\r\nhills in which they lie.\r\n\r\nThe society was then gay and polite, and HERSCHEL was at once thrown\r\ninto a far more intelligent atmosphere than that he had just left in\r\nYorkshire. It was easy to get new books, to see new faces, to hear new\r\nthings. The Assembly Rooms (built in 1771) were noted for their size and\r\nelegance; the theatre was the best out of London.\r\n\r\nHis position as organist of the fashionable chapel placed him in the\r\ncurrent. His charming and engaging manners made him friends. His talents\r\nbrought him admirers and pupils, and pupils brought him money.[7]\r\n\r\nHe began in 1766 a life of unceasing activity, which continued. In 1768\r\nhe published in London a symphony (in C) for two violins, viola, bass,\r\ntwo oboes, and two horns, and in the same year two military concertos\r\nfor two oboes, two horns, two trumpets, and two bassoons.[8] He wrote\r\npieces for the harp, glees, \"catches,\" and other songs for the\r\nvoice. One of these, the _Echo Catch_, was published and had even\r\nconsiderable vogue.\r\n\r\n    A competent musical critic writes to me of this work: \"The\r\n    counterpoint is clear and flowing, and is managed with considerable\r\n    taste and effect. It would be difficult to explain the great\r\n    cleverness shown in the construction of the _Catch_ without diagrams\r\n    to illustrate the movements of the parts. It is certainly an\r\n    ingenious bit of musical writing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he left Bath (in 1782), many of these musical writings were lost,\r\nin his great haste to take up his new profession. One, specially, his\r\nsister remembers to have written out for the printer, \"but he could not\r\nfind a moment to send it off, nor answer the printer's letters.\" This\r\nwas a four-part song, \"In thee I bear so dear a part.\" He wrote very\r\nmany anthems, chants, and psalm-tunes for the excellent cathedral choir\r\nof the Octagon Chapel. Unfortunately, most of this music is now not to\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nA notice of HERSCHEL'S life which appeared in the _European Magazine_\r\nfor 1785, January, gives a very lively picture of his life at this\r\ntime, and it is especially valuable as showing how he appeared to his\r\ncotemporaries.\r\n\r\n    \"Although Mr. HERSCHEL loved music to an excess, and made a\r\n    considerable progress in it, he yet determined with a sort of\r\n    enthusiasm to devote every moment he could spare from business to\r\n    the pursuit of knowledge, which he regarded as the sovereign good,\r\n    and in which he resolved to place all his views of future happiness\r\n    in life.\". . .\r\n\r\n    \"His situation at the Octagon Chapel proved a very profitable one,\r\n    as he soon fell into all the public business of the concerts, the\r\n    Rooms, the Theatre, and the oratorios, besides many scholars and\r\n    private concerts. This great run of business, instead of lessening\r\n    his propensity to study, increased it, so that many times, after a\r\n    fatiguing day of fourteen or sixteen hours spent in his vocation, he\r\n    would retire at night with the greatest avidity to _unbend the\r\n    mind_, if it may be so called, with a few propositions in\r\n    MACLAURIN'S _Fluxions_, or other books of that sort.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in these years that he mastered Italian and made some progress\r\nin Greek.\r\n\r\n    \"We may hazard a natural conjecture respecting the course of\r\n    HERSCHEL'S early studies. Music conducted him to mathematics, or,\r\n    in other words, impelled him to study SMITH'S _Harmonics_. Now this\r\n    ROBERT SMITH was the author of _A Complete System of Optics_,\r\n    a masterly work, which, notwithstanding the rapid growth of that\r\n    branch of the science, is not yet wholly superseded. It seems to us\r\n    not unlikely that HERSCHEL, studying the _Harmonics_, conceived a\r\n    reverence for the author, who was at that time still living, so that\r\n    from the _Philosophy of Music_ he passed to the _Optics_, a work on\r\n    which SMITH'S great reputation chiefly rested; and thus undesignedly\r\n    prepared himself for the career on which he was shortly about to\r\n    enter with so much glory.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this conjecture is a true one. The _Optics_ of\r\nDr. SMITH is one of the very few books quoted by HERSCHEL throughout his\r\nwritings, and there is every evidence of his complete familiarity with\r\nits conclusions and methods; and this familiarity is of the kind which a\r\nstudent acquires with his early text-books. One other work he quotes in\r\nthe same way, LALANDE'S _Astronomy_, and this too must have been deeply\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1765-1772, while HERSCHEL was following his profession\r\nand his studies at Bath, the family life at Hanover went on in much the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 his father ISAAC had a stroke of paralysis, which ended his\r\nviolin-playing forever, and forced him to depend entirely upon pupils\r\nand copying of music for a livelihood. He died on March 22, 1767,\r\nleaving behind him a good name, and living in the affectionate\r\nremembrance of his children and of all who knew him.\r\n\r\nCAROLINA had now lost her best friend, and transferred to her brother\r\nWILLIAM the affection she had before divided between him and her father.\r\n\r\n    \"My father wished to give me something like a polished education,\r\n    but my mother was particularly determined that it should be a rough,\r\n    but at the same time a useful one; and nothing farther she thought\r\n    was necessary but to send me two or three months to a sempstress to\r\n    be taught to make household linen. . . . My mother would not consent\r\n    to my being taught French, and my brother Dietrich was even denied a\r\n    dancing-master, because she would not permit my learning along with\r\n    him, though the entrance had been paid for us both; so all my father\r\n    could do for me was to indulge me (and please himself) sometimes\r\n    with a short lesson on the violin, when my mother was either in\r\n    good humor or out of the way. Though I have often felt myself\r\n    exceedingly at a loss for the want of those few accomplishments of\r\n    which I was thus, by an erroneous though well-meant opinion of my\r\n    mother, deprived, I could not help thinking but that she had cause\r\n    for wishing me not to know more than was necessary for being useful\r\n    in the family; for it was her certain belief that my brother WILLIAM\r\n    would have returned to his country, and my eldest brother not have\r\n    looked so high, if they had had a little less learning.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But sometimes I found it scarcely possible to get through with the\r\n    work required, and felt very unhappy that no time at all was left\r\n    for improving myself in music or fancy work, in which I had an\r\n    opportunity of receiving some instruction from an ingenious young\r\n    woman whose parents lived in the same house with us. But the time\r\n    wanted for spending a few hours together could only be obtained by\r\n    our meeting at daybreak, because by the time of the family's rising\r\n    at seven, I was obliged to be at my daily business. Though I had\r\n    neither time nor means for producing anything immediately either for\r\n    show or use, I was content with keeping samples of all possible\r\n    patterns in needlework, beads, bugles, horse-hair, etc., for I could\r\n    not help feeling troubled sometimes about my future destiny; yet I\r\n    could not bear the idea of being turned into an Abigail or\r\n    housemaid, and thought that with the above and such like\r\n    acquirements, with a little notion of music, I might obtain a place\r\n    as governess in some family where the want of a knowledge of French\r\n    would be no objection.\"\r\n\r\nA change was soon to come in her life too; her brother WILLIAM wrote\r\nto propose that she should join him at Bath--\r\n\r\n    . . . \"to make the trial, if, by his instruction, I might not become\r\n    a useful singer for his winter concerts and oratorios; he advised my\r\n    brother JACOB to give me some lessons by way of beginning; but that\r\n    if, after a trial of two years, we should not find it answer our\r\n    expectation, he would bring me back again. This at first seemed to\r\n    be agreeable to all parties, but by the time I had set my heart upon\r\n    this change in my situation, JACOB began to turn the whole scheme\r\n    into ridicule, and, of course, he never heard the sound of my voice\r\n    except in speaking, and yet I was left in the harassing uncertainty\r\n    whether I was to go or not. I resolved at last to prepare, as far as\r\n    lay in my power, for both cases, by taking, in the first place,\r\n    every opportunity, when all were from home, to imitate, with a gag\r\n    between my teeth, the solo parts of concertos, _shake and all_, such\r\n    as I had heard them play on the violin; in consequence I had gained\r\n    a tolerable execution before I knew how to sing. I next began to\r\n    knit ruffles, which were intended for my brother WILLIAM, in case I\r\n    remained at home--else they were to be JACOB'S. For my mother and\r\n    brother D. I knitted as many cotton stockings as would last two\r\n    years at least.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1772, her brother arrived at Hanover, to take her back to\r\nEngland with him. The journey to London was made between August 16th and\r\n26th, and soon after they went together to HERSCHEL'S house, No. 7 New\r\nKing's Street, Bath.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Wife of Major JOHN HERSCHEL, of the Royal Engineers,\r\ngrandson of Sir WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n[2] Page 127.\r\n\r\n[3] _Memoir_ of CAROLINA HERSCHEL, p. 10.

She was a perfectly untried girl, of very\r\nsmall accomplishments and outwardly with but little to attract. The\r\nbasis of her character was the possibility of an unchanging devotion to\r\none object; for the best years of her life this object was the happiness\r\nand success of her brother WILLIAM, whom she profoundly loved. Her love\r\nwas headstrong and full of a kind of obstinate pride, which refused to\r\nsee anything but the view she had adopted. As long as her life continued\r\nto be with her dearest brother, all was well with her. She had a noble\r\naim, and her heart was more than full. Later on, this very singleness of\r\ncharacter brought her other years of wretchedness. It is necessary to\r\nunderstand the almost spaniel-like allegiance she gave, in order to\r\ncomprehend the value which her services were to HERSCHEL. She supplied\r\nhim with an aid which was utterly loyal, entire, and devoted. Her\r\nobedience was unquestioning, her reverence amounted almost to adoration.\r\nIn their relation, he gave everything in the way of incentive and\r\ninitiative, and she returned her entire effort loyally.\r\n\r\nAt first her business was to gain a knowledge of the language, and to\r\nperfect herself in singing, so that she might become a soloist in the\r\nconcerts and oratorios which he was constantly giving.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning it was not easy.\r\n\r\n    . . . \"As the season for the arrival of visitors to the baths does\r\n    not begin till October, my brother had leisure to try my capacity for\r\n    becoming a useful singer for his concerts and oratorios, and being\r\n    very well satisfied with my voice, I had two or three lessons every\r\n    day, and the hours which were not spent at the harpsichord, were\r\n    employed in putting me in the way of managing the family. . . .\r\n    On the second morning, on meeting my brother at breakfast, he began\r\n    immediately to give me a lesson in English and arithmetic, and\r\n    showed me the way of booking and keeping accounts of cash received\r\n    and laid out. . . . By way of relaxation we talked of astronomy and\r\n    the bright constellations with which I had made acquaintance during\r\n    the fine nights we spent on the postwagen travelling through Holland.\r\n\r\n    \"My brother ALEXANDER, who had been some time in England, boarded\r\n    and lodged with his elder brother, and, with myself, occupied the\r\n    attic. The first floor, which was furnished in the newest and most\r\n    handsome style, my brother kept for himself. The front room,\r\n    containing the harpsichord, was always in order to receive his\r\n    musical friends and scholars at little private concerts or\r\n    rehearsals. . . . Sundays I received a sum for the weekly expenses,\r\n    of which my housekeeping book (written in English) showed the amount\r\n    laid out, and my purse the remaining cash. One of the principal\r\n    things required was to market, and about six weeks after coming to\r\n    England I was sent alone among fishwomen, butchers, basket-women,\r\n    etc., and I brought home whatever in my fright I could pick up. . . .\r\n    My brother ALEX., who was now returned from his summer engagement,\r\n    used to watch me at a distance, unknown to me, till he saw me safe\r\n    on my way home. But all attempts to introduce any order in our\r\n    little household proved vain, owing to the servant my brother then\r\n    had. And what still further increased my difficulty was, that my\r\n    brother's time was entirely taken up with business, so that I only\r\n    saw him at meals. Breakfast was at seven o'clock or before--much too\r\n    early for me, who would rather have remained up all night than be\r\n    obliged to rise at so early an hour. . . .\r\n\r\n    \"The three winter months passed on very heavily. I had to struggle\r\n    against _heimwehe_ (home sickness) and low spirits, and to answer my\r\n    sister's melancholy letters on the death of her husband, by which\r\n    she became a widow with six children. I knew too little English to\r\n    derive any consolation from the society of those who were about me,\r\n    so that, dinner-time excepted, I was entirely left to myself.\"\r\n\r\nSo the winter passed.\r\n\r\n    \"The time when I could hope to receive a little more of my brother's\r\n    instruction and attention was now drawing near; for after Easter,\r\n    Bath becomes very empty, only a few of his scholars, whose families\r\n    were resident in the neighborhood, remaining. But I was greatly\r\n    disappointed; for, in consequence of the harassing and fatiguing\r\n    life he had led during the winter months, he used to retire to bed\r\n    with a basin of milk or glass of water, and SMITH'S _Harmonics_ and\r\n    _Optics_, FERGUSON'S _Astronomy_, etc., and so went to sleep buried\r\n    under his favorite authors; and his first thoughts on rising were\r\n    how to obtain instruments for viewing those objects himself of which\r\n    he had been reading. There being in one of the shops a\r\n    two-and-a-half-foot Gregorian telescope to be let, it was for some\r\n    time taken in requisition, and served not only for viewing the\r\n    heavens, but for making experiments on its construction. . . . It soon\r\n    appeared that my brother was not contented with knowing what former\r\n    observers had seen, for he began to contrive a telescope eighteen or\r\n    twenty feet long (I believe after HUYGHENS' description). . . . I was\r\n    much hindered in my musical practice by my help being continually\r\n    wanted in the execution of the various contrivances, and I had to\r\n    amuse myself with making the tube of pasteboard for the glasses,\r\n    which were to arrive from London, for at that time no optician had\r\n    settled at Bath. But when all was finished, no one besides my\r\n    brother could get a glimpse of Jupiter or Saturn, for the great\r\n    length of the tube would not allow it to be kept in a straight line.\r\n    This difficulty, however, was soon removed by substituting tin\r\n    tubes. . . . My brother wrote to inquire the price of a reflecting\r\n    mirror for (I believe) a five or six foot telescope. The answer was,\r\n    there were none of so large a size, but a person offered to make one\r\n    at a price much above what my brother thought proper to give. . . .\r\n    About this time he bought of a Quaker, resident at Bath, who had\r\n    formerly made attempts at polishing mirrors, all his rubbish of\r\n    patterns, tools, hones, polishers, unfinished mirrors, etc., but all\r\n    for small Gregorians, and none above two or three inches diameter.\r\n\r\n    \"But nothing serious could be attempted, for want of time, till the\r\n    beginning of June, when some of my brother's scholars were leaving\r\n    Bath; and then, to my sorrow, I saw almost every room turned into a\r\n    workshop. A cabinet-maker making a tube and stands of all\r\n    descriptions in a handsomely furnished drawing-room; ALEX. putting\r\n    up a huge turning machine (which he had brought in the autumn from\r\n    Bristol, where he used to spend the summer) in a bedroom, for\r\n    turning patterns, grinding glasses, and turning eye-pieces, etc. At\r\n    the same time music durst not lie entirely dormant during the\r\n    summer, and my brother had frequent rehearsals at home, where Miss\r\n    FARINELLI, an Italian singer, was met by several of the principal\r\n    performers he had engaged for the winter concerts.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1774, he had made himself a Gregorian telescope,[10] and\r\nhad begun to view the heavens. He was then thirty-six years old.\r\n\r\nThe writer in the _European Magazine_ describes this period:\r\n\r\n    \"All this time he continued his astronomical observations, and\r\n    nothing now seemed wanting to complete his felicity, but sufficient\r\n    leisure to enjoy his telescopes, to which he was so much attached,\r\n    that at the theatre he used frequently to run from the harpsichord\r\n    to look at the stars, during the time between the acts.\"\r\n\r\nIn an extract from his _Journal No. 1_, now at the rooms of the Royal\r\nSociety, may be seen a copy of his first observation of the Nebula of\r\n_Orion_, on March 4, 1774. This was made with his five-and-a-half-foot\r\nGregorian reflector.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time (1775), between the acts of the theatre, that he\r\nmade his first review of the heavens, with a Newtonian telescope, of an\r\naperture of four and a half inches and a magnifying power of 222 times.\r\nThis telescope was one of the first made by himself. The review\r\nconsisted of the examination of every star in the sky of the first,\r\nsecond, third, and fourth magnitudes, and of all planets visible. There\r\nare no records of these observations now extant, and they are noteworthy\r\nonly as a preparation for more serious work.\r\n\r\nHe was carrying out his resolve to see everything for himself. His\r\nassiduity may be judged of by the fact that between 1774 and 1781\r\nHERSCHEL had observed a single object--the Nebula of _Orion_--no less\r\nthan fourteen times.\r\n\r\nThe success of his first telescopes incited him to new efforts. His\r\nhouse became a complete _atelier_, where everything that could tend to\r\nexcellence in this manufacture was tried and re-tried a hundred\r\ndifferent ways. When a difficulty arose, experiments were begun which\r\ncontinued till it was conquered. When a success was gained, it was\r\nprosecuted to the utmost.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 the first seven-foot reflector was made, in 1777 a ten-foot was\r\nfinished, in 1778 a \"very good\" ten-foot took its place. It must not be\r\nthought that the telescopes mentioned were the only ones completed. On\r\nthe contrary, they were but the best ones selected out of many.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 a new house had been engaged, which had \"more room for\r\nworkshops,\" and whose roof gave space for observing. The grass-plat near\r\nit was soon utilized to hold the stand of a twenty-foot telescope, which\r\nhe had even then projected. His projects were unending, no success was\r\nfinal; his mind was at the height of activity; his whole effort was\r\nthrown into every undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors for all these telescopes were made by hand. Every portion\r\nof the grinding down to rough dimensions, the shaping to something near\r\nthe correct form, the polishing till the accurately exact curves were\r\nobtained, all this must be done by hand. The machines for the purpose\r\nwere not invented until 1788.[11]\r\n\r\nALEXANDER and WILLIAM worked together at this, but most of the work was\r\ndone by the latter. The sister's part was to attend in the workshop and\r\nlend a hand wherever and whenever it was needed.\r\n\r\n    . . . \"My time was taken up with copying music and practising, besides\r\n    attendance on my brother when polishing, since by way of keeping him\r\n    alive I was constantly obliged to feed him by putting the victuals by\r\n    bits into his mouth. This was once the case when, in order to finish\r\n    a seven-foot mirror, he had not taken his hands from it for sixteen\r\n    hours together. In general he was never unemployed at meals, but was\r\n    always at those times contriving or making drawings of whatever\r\n    came in his mind. Generally I was obliged to read to him whilst\r\n    he was at the turning-lathe, or polishing mirrors, _Don Quixote_,\r\n    _Arabian Nights' Entertainment_, the novels of STERNE, FIELDING,\r\n    etc.; serving tea and supper without interrupting the work with\r\n    which he was engaged, . . . and sometimes lending a hand. I became,\r\n    in time, as useful a member of the workshop as a boy might be to\r\n    his master in the first year of his apprenticeship. . . . But as\r\n    I was to take a part the next year in the oratorios, I had, for a\r\n    whole twelvemonth, two lessons per week from Miss FLEMING, the\r\n    celebrated dancing-mistress, to drill me for a gentlewoman (God\r\n    knows how she succeeded). So we lived on without interruption.\r\n    My brother ALEX. was absent from Bath for some months every summer,\r\n    but when at home he took much pleasure in executing some turning or\r\n    clockmaker's work for his brother.\"\r\n\r\nNews from Hanover put a sudden stop, for a time, to all these labors.\r\nThe mother wrote, in the utmost distress, to say that DIETRICH had\r\ndisappeared from his home, it was supposed with the intention of going\r\nto India \"with a young idler not older than himself.\" His brother\r\nimmediately left the lathe at which he was turning an eye-piece in\r\ncocoa-nut, and started for Holland, whence he proceeded to Hanover,\r\nfailing to meet his brother, as he expected. Meanwhile the sister\r\nreceived a letter to say that DIETRICH was \"laid up very ill\" at an inn\r\nin Wapping. ALEXANDER posted to town, removed him to a lodging, and,\r\nafter a fortnight's nursing, brought him to Bath, where, on his brother\r\nWILLIAM'S return, he found him being well cared for by his sister.\r\n\r\nAbout this time another change was made to the house 19 New King Street,\r\nwhich was the last move in Bath. It was here that the _Georgium Sidus_\r\nwas discovered.\r\n\r\nThe music still went on. The oratorios of the _Messiah_, _Judas\r\nMaccabeus_, and _Samson_ were to be performed under HERSCHEL'S\r\ndirection, with an orchestra of nearly one hundred pieces. The scores\r\nand vocal parts of these CAROLINA copied with her own hands, and the\r\n_soprani_ were instructed by her, she being the leading soloist. Along\r\nwith the music went the astronomy. Not only were new telescopes made,\r\nbut they were made for immediate use.\r\n\r\nThe variable star _Mira Ceti_ was observed, and a long series of lunar\r\nobservations begun.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1779, 1780, and 1781 I measured the heights of about one hundred\r\n    mountains of the moon, by three different methods.\r\n\r\n    \"Some of these observations are given in _Philosophical\r\n    Transactions_, vol. LXX., but most remain uncalculated in my journal\r\n    _till some proper opportunity.\"[12]_\r\n\r\nWhile HERSCHEL was measuring these lunar mountains, in December, 1779,\r\nhe made by chance an acquaintance of much value to him. Dr. WILLIAM\r\nWATSON, a Fellow of the Royal Society, distinguished for his researches\r\nin electricity, happened to see him at his telescope, and this led to a\r\nvisit and an invitation to HERSCHEL to join the Philosophical Society of\r\nBath, then forming. This he gladly did, and it was of use to him in many\r\nways.\r\n\r\nHe there formed acquaintance with men of his own way of thinking, and he\r\nhimself became known. Better than all, he learned to measure himself\r\nwith other men, and by his early papers read to the Society, he gained\r\nskill in putting his thoughts before his hearers. This skill he never\r\nlost, and the merely literary art of his memoirs would make his papers\r\nremarkable without their other merits. He is always clear, and in his\r\nearly papers especially, he appeals to his particular audience--the\r\nRoyal Society--in a way which shows that he is conscious of all its\r\nweaknesses as well as of its dignity. Later, his tone slightly changed.\r\nHe became less anxious to win his audience, for he had become an\r\nauthority. This knowledge lent a quiet strength to his style, but never\r\ninduced the slightest arrogance of spirit or manner.\r\n\r\nThe Bath Philosophical Society has left no printed proceedings. HERSCHEL\r\nwas one of its earliest members, and many papers were communicated to it\r\nby his hand. These appear to have been of a very miscellaneous nature.\r\nSome of them at least would be of the highest interest to us now.\r\n\r\nIn the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1789, p. 220, HERSCHEL tells us\r\nthat he communicated to that Society \"certain mathematical papers\"\r\nrelating to central forces other than the force of gravity, which are or\r\nmay be concerned in the construction of the sidereal heavens. This early\r\nidea was still entertained by HERSCHEL in 1789, and the mathematical\r\npapers referred to must be contained in the _Minutes_ of the Society,\r\nwhich on its dissolution were torn from the Minute-book and returned to\r\nthe writers.\r\n\r\nThe earliest published writing of HERSCHEL is the answer to the prize\r\nquestion in the \"Ladies' Diary\" for 1779, proposed by the celebrated\r\nLANDEN, namely:\r\n\r\n    \"The length, tension, and weight of a musical string being given,\r\n    it is required to find how many vibrations it will make in a given\r\n    time, when a small given weight is fastened to its middle and\r\n    vibrates with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society for 1780, are\r\ntwo papers of his. The title of the first is, _Astronomical Observations\r\non the Periodical Star in Collo Ceti_, by Mr. WILLIAM HERSCHEL, of Bath.\r\nThis was communicated to the Society by Dr. WILLIAM WATSON, Jr., and\r\nwas read May 11, 1780, at the same time as the other paper on the\r\nmountains of the moon. It is to be noted that HERSCHEL was at this time\r\nplain \"Mr. WILLIAM HERSCHEL, of Bath.\" It was only in 1786 that he\r\nbecame \"Dr. HERSCHEL,\" through the Oxford degree of LL.D.\r\n\r\nNeither of these two papers is specially remarkable on its purely\r\nastronomical side. The problems examined were such as lay open before\r\nall, and the treatment of them was such as would naturally be suggested.\r\n\r\nThe second of these two contained, however, a short description of his\r\nNewtonian telescope, and he speaks of it with a just pride: \"I believe\r\nthat for distinctness of vision this instrument is perhaps equal to any\r\nthat was ever made.\" He was, at least, certain of having obtained\r\nexcellence in the making of his instruments.\r\n\r\nIn his next paper, however, read January 11, 1781, a subject is\r\napproached which shows a different kind of thought. It is the first\r\nobvious proof of the truth of the statement which he made long\r\nafterwards (1811), when he said: \"A knowledge of the construction of\r\nthe heavens has always been the ultimate object of my observations.\"\r\n\r\nThe title of this paper was _Astronomical Observations on the Rotation\r\nof the Planets round their Axes, made with a view to determine whether\r\nthe Earth's diurnal motion is perfectly equable_. Here the question is a\r\ndifficult and a remote one, and the method adopted for its solution is\r\nperfectly suitable in principle. It marks a step onward from mere\r\nobservations to philosophizing upon their results. In practical\r\nastronomy, too, we note an advance. Not only are his results given, but\r\nalso careful estimates of the errors to be feared in them, and a\r\ndiscussion of the sources of such errors. The same volume of the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ which contains this paper, also contains\r\nanother, _Account of a Comet_, read April 26, 1781. This comet was the\r\nmajor planet _Uranus_, or, as HERSCHEL named it, _Georgium Sidus_.\r\nHe had found it on the night of Tuesday, March 13, 1781. \"In examining\r\nthe small stars in the neighborhood of H _Geminorum_, I perceived one that\r\nappeared visibly larger than the rest; being struck with its uncommon\r\nappearance, I compared it to H _Geminorum_ and the small star in the\r\nquartile between _Auriga_ and _Gemini_, and finding it so much larger\r\nthan either of them, I suspected it to be a comet.\" The \"comet\" was\r\nobserved over all Europe. Its orbit was computed by various astronomers,\r\nand its distance from the sun was found to be nineteen times that of our\r\nearth. This was no comet, but a new major planet. The discovery of the\r\namateur astronomer of Bath was the most striking since the invention of\r\nthe telescope. It had absolutely no parallel, for every other major\r\nplanet had been known from time immemorial.[13]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the discoveries of GALILEO was felt almost more in the\r\nmoral than in the scientific world. The mystic number of the planets was\r\nbroken up by the introduction of four satellites to _Jupiter_. That\r\n_Venus_ emulated the phases of our moon, overthrew superstition and\r\nseated the Copernican theory firmly. The discovery of \"an innumerable\r\nmultitude of fixed stars\" in the Milky Way confounded the received\r\nideas. This was the great mission of the telescope in GALILEO'S hands.\r\n\r\nThe epoch of mere astronomical discovery began with the detection of the\r\nlarge satellite of _Saturn_ by HUYGHENS, in 1655. Even then superstition\r\nwas not dead. HUYGHENS did not search for more moons, because by that\r\ndiscovery he had raised the number of known satellites to six,[14] and\r\nbecause these, with the six planets, made \"the perfect number twelve.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1671 to 1684 CASSINI discovered four more moons revolving about\r\n_Saturn_. Since 1684 no new body had been added to the solar system.\r\nIt was thought complete for nearly a century.\r\n\r\nIn England, the remarkable discoveries of BRADLEY (1727-62) had been in\r\nthe field of practical astronomy, and his example had set the key-note\r\nfor further researches. France was just about beginning the brilliant\r\nperiod of her discoveries in mathematical astronomy, and had no\r\nobservatory devoted to investigations like HERSCHEL'S, with the possible\r\nexception of DARQUIER'S and FLAUGERGUES'. The observatories of SCHROETER\r\nand VON HAHN, in Germany, were not yet active. The field which HERSCHEL\r\nwas created to fill was vacant, the whole world over. It was especially\r\nso in England. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich, under MASKELYNE,\r\na skilful observer, whose work was mostly confined to meridian\r\nobservations, was no rival to a private observatory like HERSCHEL'S. The\r\nprivate observatories themselves were but small affairs; those of the\r\nking, at Kew, of Dr. WILSON, at Glasgow, of Mr. AUBERT, at Loampit Hill,\r\nof the Count VON BRUHL, in London, being perhaps the most important.\r\nThe whole field was open. What was perhaps more remarkable, there was in\r\nEngland, during HERSCHEL'S lifetime, no astronomer, public or private,\r\nwhose talents, even as an observer, lay in the same direction.\r\n\r\nIt hardly need be said that as a philosopher in his science, he had then\r\nno rival, as he has had none since. His only associates even, were\r\nMICHELL and WILSON.[15]\r\n\r\nWithout depreciating the abilities of the astronomers of England, his\r\ncotemporaries, we may fairly say that HERSCHEL stood a great man among a\r\ngroup of small ones.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavor to appreciate the change effected in the state of\r\nastronomy not only in England but in the whole world, simply by the\r\ndiscovery of _Uranus_. Suppose, for example, that the last planet in our\r\nsystem had been _Saturn_. No doubt HERSCHEL would have gone on. In spite\r\nof one and another difficulty, he would have made his ten-foot, his\r\ntwenty-foot telescopes. His forty-foot would never have been built, and\r\nthe two satellites which he found with it might not have been\r\ndiscovered. Certainly _Mimas_ would not have been. His researches on the\r\nconstruction of the heavens would have been made; those were in his\r\nbrain, and must have been ultimated. The mass of observations of\r\n_Saturn_, of _Jupiter_, of _Mars_, of _Venus_, would have been made and\r\npublished. The researches on the sun, on the \"invisible rays\" of heat,\r\non comets and nebulæ--all these might have been made, printed, and read.\r\n\r\nBut these would have gone into the _Philosophical Transactions_ as the\r\nwork of an amateur astronomer, \"Mr. HERSCHEL, of Bath.\" They would have\r\nbeen praised, and they would have been doubted. It would have taken a\r\nwhole generation to have appreciated them. They would have been severely\r\ntried, entirely on their merits, and finally they would have stood where\r\nthey stand to-day--unrivalled. But through what increased labors these\r\nsuccesses would have been gained! It is not merely that the patronage of\r\nthe king, the subsidies for the forty-foot telescope (£4,000), the\r\ncomparative ease of HERSCHEL'S life would have been lacking. It is more\r\nthan this. It would have been necessary for him to have created the\r\naudience to which he appealed, and to have conquered the most persistent\r\nof enemies--indifference.\r\n\r\nCertainly, if HERSCHEL'S mind had been other than it was, the discovery\r\nof _Uranus_, which brought him honors from every scientific society in\r\nthe world, and which gave him authority, might have had a hurtful\r\neffect. But, as he was, there was nothing which could have aided his\r\ncareer more than this startling discovery. It was needed for him. It\r\ncompleted the solar system far more by affording a free play to a\r\nprofoundly philosophical mind, than by occupying the vacant spaces\r\nbeyond _Saturn_.\r\n\r\nHis opportunities would have been profoundly modified, though his\r\npersonal worth would have been the same.\r\n\r\n    \"The Star that from the zenith darts its beams,\r\n    Visible though it be to half the earth,\r\n    Though half a sphere be conscious of its brightness,\r\n    Is yet of no diviner origin,\r\n    No purer essence, than the One that burns\r\n    Like an untended watchfire, on the ridge\r\n    Of some dark mountain; or than those that seem\r\n    Humbly to hang, like twinkling winter lamps,\r\n    Among the branches of the leafless trees.\"\r\n\r\nTo show how completely unknown the private astronomer of Bath was at\r\nthis time, I transcribe a sentence from BODE'S account of the discovery\r\nof _Uranus_.\r\n\r\n    \"In the _Gazette Littéraire_ of June, 1781, this worthy man is\r\n    called MERSTHEL; in JULIUS' _Journal Encyclopédique_, HERTSCHEL;\r\n    in a letter from Mr. MASKELYNE to M. MESSIER, HERTHEL; in another\r\n    letter of MASKELYNE'S to Herr MAYER, at Mannheim, HERRSCHELL; M.\r\n    DARQUIER calls him HERMSTEL. What may his name be? He must have been\r\n    born a _German_.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThis obscurity did not long continue. The news spread quickly from\r\nfashionable Bath to London. On the 6th of December, 1781, HERSCHEL was\r\nelected a Fellow of the Royal Society, to which he was formally\r\n\"admitted\" May 30, 1782. He was forty-three years old.\r\n\r\nHe also received the Copley medal in 1781 for his \"discovery of a new\r\nand singular star.\"[17]\r\n\r\n    . . . \"He was now frequently interrupted by visitors who were\r\n    introduced by some of his resident scholars, among whom I remember\r\n    Sir HARRY ENGELFIELD, Dr. BLAGDEN, and Dr. MASKELYNE. With the\r\n    latter he was engaged in a long conversation, which to me sounded\r\n    like quarrelling, and the first words my brother said after he was\r\n    gone were: 'That is a devil of a fellow.'. . .\r\n\r\n    \"I suppose their names were often not known, or were forgotten; for\r\n    it was not till the year 1782 or 1783 that a memorandum of the names\r\n    of visitors was thought of.\". . . \"My brother now applied himself to\r\n    perfect his mirrors, erecting in his garden a stand for his\r\n    twenty-foot telescope; many trials were necessary before the\r\n    required motions for such an unwieldy machine could be contrived.\r\n    Many attempts were made by way of experiment before an intended\r\n    thirty-foot telescope could be completed, for which, between whiles\r\n    (not interrupting the observations with seven, ten, and twenty-foot,\r\n    and writing papers for both the Royal and Bath Philosophical\r\n    Societies), gauges, shapes, weight, etc., of the mirror were\r\n    calculated, and trials of the composition of the metal were made. In\r\n    short, I saw nothing else and heard nothing else talked of but these\r\n    things when my brothers were together. ALEX. was always very alert,\r\n    assisting when anything new was going forward, but he wanted\r\n    perseverance, and never liked to confine himself at home for many\r\n    hours together. And so it happened that my brother WILLIAM was\r\n    obliged to make trial of my abilities in copying for him catalogues,\r\n    tables, etc., and sometimes whole papers which were lent him for his\r\n    perusal. Among them was one by Mr. MICHELL and a catalogue of\r\n    CHRISTIAN MAYER, in Latin, which kept me employed when my brother\r\n    was at the telescope at night. When I found that a hand was\r\n    sometimes wanted when any particular measures were to be made with\r\n    the lamp micrometer, etc., or a fire to be kept up, or a dish of\r\n    coffee necessary during a long night's watching, I undertook with\r\n    pleasure what others might have thought a hardship. . . . Since the\r\n    discovery of the _Georgium Sidus_ [March 13, 1781], I believe few\r\n    men of learning or consequence left Bath before they had seen and\r\n    conversed with its discoverer, and thought themselves fortunate in\r\n    finding him at home on their repeated visits. Sir WILLIAM WATSON was\r\n    almost an intimate, for hardly a day passed but he had something to\r\n    communicate from the letters which he received from Sir JOSEPH\r\n    BANKS, and other members of the Royal Society, from which it\r\n    appeared that my brother was expected in town to receive the gold\r\n    medal. The end of November was the most precarious season for\r\n    absenting himself. But Sir WILLIAM WATSON went with him, and it was\r\n    arranged so that they set out with the diligence at night, and by\r\n    that means his absence did not last above three or four days, when\r\n    my brother returned alone, Sir WILLIAM remaining with his father.\r\n\r\n    \"Now a very busy winter was commencing; for my brother had engaged\r\n    himself to conduct the oratorios conjointly with RONZINI, and had\r\n    made himself answerable for the payment of the engaged performers,\r\n    for his credit ever stood high in the opinion of every one he had to\r\n    deal with. (He lost considerably by this arrangement.) But, though\r\n    at times much harassed with business, the mirror for the thirty-foot\r\n    reflector was never out of his mind, and if a minute could but be\r\n    spared in going from one scholar to another, or giving one the slip,\r\n    he called at home to see how the men went on with the furnace, which\r\n    was built in a room below, even with the garden.\r\n\r\n    \"The mirror was to be cast in a mould of loam, of which an immense\r\n    quantity was to be pounded in a mortar and sifted through a fine\r\n    sieve. It was an endless piece of work, and served me for many an\r\n    hour's exercise; and ALEX. frequently took his turn at it, for we\r\n    were all eager to do something towards the great undertaking. Even\r\n    Sir WILLIAM WATSON would sometimes take the pestle from me when he\r\n    found me in the work-room, where he expected to find his friend, in\r\n    whose concerns he took so much interest that he felt much\r\n    disappointed at not being allowed to pay for the metal. But I do not\r\n    think my brother ever accepted pecuniary assistance from any one of\r\n    his friends, and on this occasion he declined the offer by saying it\r\n    was paid for already.\r\n\r\n    \"Among the Bath visitors were many philosophical gentlemen who used\r\n    to frequent the levées at St. James's, when in town. Colonel WALSH,\r\n    in particular, informed my brother that from a conversation he had\r\n    had with His Majesty, it appeared that in the spring he was to come\r\n    with his seven-foot telescope to the king. Similar reports he\r\n    received from many others, but they made no great impression nor\r\n    caused any interruption in his occupation or study, and as soon as\r\n    the season for the concerts was over, and the mould, etc., in\r\n    readiness, a day was set apart for casting, and the metal was in the\r\n    furnace. Unfortunately it began to leak at the moment when ready for\r\n    pouring, and both my brothers and the caster, with his men, were\r\n    obliged to run out at opposite doors, for the stone flooring (which\r\n    ought to have been taken up) flew about in all directions as high as\r\n    the ceiling. Before the second casting was attempted, everything\r\n    which could insure success had been attended to, and a very perfect\r\n    metal was found in the mould.\r\n\r\n    \"But a total stop and derangement now took place, and nearly six or\r\n    seven months elapsed before my brother could return to the\r\n    undisturbed enjoyment of his instruments and observations. For one\r\n    morning in Passion Week, as Sir WILLIAM WATSON was with my brother,\r\n    talking about the pending journey to town, my eldest nephew arrived\r\n    to pay us a visit, and brought the confirmation that his uncle was\r\n    expected with his instrument in town. . . . We had not one night in\r\n    the week, except Friday, but what was set apart for an oratorio either\r\n    at Bath or Bristol. Soon after Easter, a new organ being erected in\r\n    St. James's Church, it was opened with two performances of the\r\n    'Messiah;' this again took up some of my brother's time.\". . .\r\n\r\nIn May of 1782 HERSCHEL went to London.\r\n\r\n    \"But when almost double the time had elapsed which my brother could\r\n    safely be absent from his scholars, ALEX., as well as myself, were\r\n    much at a loss how to answer their inquiries, for, from the letters\r\n    we received, we could learn nothing but that he had been introduced\r\n    to the king and queen, and had permission to come to the concerts at\r\n    Buckingham House, where the king conversed with him about\r\n    astronomy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during his absence at this time that the three following letters\r\nwere written and received:\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR LINA:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have had an audience of His Majesty this morning, and met with a\r\n    very gracious reception. I presented him with the drawing of the\r\n    solar system, and had the honor of explaining it to him and the\r\n    queen. My telescope is in three weeks' time to go to Richmond, and\r\n    meanwhile to be put up at Greenwich, where I shall accordingly carry\r\n    it to-day. So you see, LINA, that you must not think of seeing me in\r\n    less than a month. I shall write to Miss LEE myself; and other\r\n    scholars who inquire for me, you may tell that I cannot wait on them\r\n    till His Majesty shall be pleased to give me leave to return, or\r\n    rather to dismiss me, for till then I must attend. I will also write\r\n    to Mr. PALMER to acquaint him with it.\r\n\r\n    \"I am in a great hurry, therefore can write no more at present.\r\n    Tell ALEXANDER that everything looks very likely as if I were to stay\r\n    here. The king inquired after him, and after my great speculum. He\r\n    also gave me leave to come to hear the GRIESBACHS play at the\r\n    private concert which he has every evening. My having seen the king\r\n    need not be kept a secret, but about my staying here it will be best\r\n    not to say anything, but only that I must remain here till His\r\n    Majesty has observed the planets with my telescope.\r\n\r\n    \"Yesterday I dined with Colonel WALSH, who inquired after you. There\r\n    were Mr. AUBERT and Dr. MASKELYNE. Dr. MASKELYNE in public declared\r\n    his obligations to me for having introduced to them the high powers,\r\n    for Mr. AUBERT has so much succeeded with them that he says he looks\r\n    down upon 200, 300, or 400 with contempt, and immediately begins\r\n    with 800. He has used 2,500 very completely, and seen my fine double\r\n    stars with them. All my papers are printing, with the postscript and\r\n    all, and are allowed to be very valuable. You see, LINA, I tell you\r\n    all these things. You know vanity is not my foible, therefore I need\r\n    not fear your censure. Farewell.\r\n\r\n                   \"I am, your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\n                                           \"WM. HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Saturday Morning,\r\n\r\n         \"probably _May 25, 1782_.\"\r\n\r\n                    TO MISS HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n                                    \"Monday Evening, _June 3, 1782._\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR LINA:--\r\n\r\n    \"I pass my time between Greenwich and London agreeably enough,\r\n    but am rather at a loss for work that I like. Company is not always\r\n    pleasing, and I would much rather be polishing a speculum. Last\r\n    Friday I was at the king's concert to hear GEORGE play. The king\r\n    spoke to me as soon as he saw me, and kept me in conversation for\r\n    half an hour. He asked GEORGE to play a solo-concerto on purpose\r\n    that I might hear him; and GEORGE plays extremely well, is very much\r\n    improved, and the king likes him very much. These two last nights I\r\n    have been star-gazing at Greenwich with Dr. MASKELYNE and Mr.\r\n    AUBERT. We have compared our telescopes together, and mine was found\r\n    very superior to any of the Royal Observatory. Double stars which\r\n    they could not see with their instruments I had the pleasure to show\r\n    them very plainly, and my mechanism is so much approved of that\r\n    Dr. MASKELYNE has already ordered a model to be taken from mine,\r\n    and a stand to be made by it to his reflector. He is, however, now\r\n    so much out of love with his instrument that he begins to doubt\r\n    whether it _deserves_ a new stand.\r\n\r\n    \"I am introduced to the best company. To-morrow I dine at Lord\r\n    PALMERSTON'S, next day with Sir JOSEPH BANKS, etc., etc. Among\r\n    opticians and astronomers nothing now is talked of but _what they\r\n    call_ my great discoveries. Alas! this shows how far they are\r\n    behind, when such trifles as I have seen and done are called\r\n    _great_. Let me but get at it again! I will make such telescopes,\r\n    and see such things--that is, I will endeavor to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO MISS HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n                                                     \"_July 3, 1782._\"\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR CAROLINA:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have been so much employed that you will not wonder at my not\r\n    writing sooner. The letter you sent me last Monday came very safe to\r\n    me. As Dr. WATSON has been so good as to acquaint you and ALEXANDER\r\n    with my situation, I was still more easy in my silence to you. Last\r\n    night the King, the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal,\r\n    Princess SOPHIA, Princess AUGUSTA, etc., Duke of MONTAGUE, Dr.\r\n    HEBERDEN, M. DE LUC, etc., etc., saw my telescope, and it was a very\r\n    fine evening. My instrument gave general satisfaction. The king has\r\n    very good eyes, and enjoys observations with telescopes exceedingly.\r\n\r\n    \"This evening, as the king and queen are gone to Kew, the princesses\r\n    were desirous of seeing my telescope, but wanted to know if it was\r\n    possible to see without going out on the grass, and were much\r\n    pleased when they heard that my telescope could be carried into any\r\n    place they liked best to have it. About eight o'clock it was moved\r\n    into the queen's apartments, and we waited some time in hopes of\r\n    seeing _Jupiter_ or _Saturn_. Meanwhile I showed the princesses, and\r\n    several other ladies who were present, the speculum, the\r\n    micrometers, the movements of the telescopes, and other things that\r\n    seemed to excite their curiosity. When the evening appeared to be\r\n    totally unpromising, I proposed an artificial _Saturn_ as an object,\r\n    since we could not have the real one. I had beforehand prepared this\r\n    little piece, as I guessed by the appearance of the weather in the\r\n    afternoon we should have no stars to look at. This being accepted\r\n    with great pleasure, I had the lamps lighted up which illuminated\r\n    the picture of a _Saturn_ (cut out in pasteboard) at the bottom of\r\n    the garden wall. The effect was fine, and so natural that the best\r\n    astronomer might have been deceived. Their royal highnesses and\r\n    other ladies seemed to be much pleased with the artifice.\r\n\r\n    \"I remained in the queen's apartment with the ladies till about half\r\n    after ten; when in conversation with them I found them extremely\r\n    well instructed in every subject that was introduced, and they\r\n    seemed to be most amiable characters. To-morrow evening they hope to\r\n    have better luck, and nothing will give me greater happiness than to\r\n    be able to show them some of those beautiful objects with which the\r\n    heavens are so gloriously ornamented.\"\r\n\r\nCAROLINA'S diary goes on:\r\n\r\n    \"Sir WILLIAM WATSON returned to Bath after a fort-night or three\r\n    weeks' stay. From him we heard that my brother was invited to\r\n    Greenwich with the telescope, where he was met by a numerous party\r\n    of astronomical and learned gentlemen, and trials of his instrument\r\n    were made. In these letters he complained of being obliged to lead\r\n    an idle life, having nothing to do but to pass between London and\r\n    Greenwich. Sir WILLIAM received many letters, which he was so kind\r\n    as to communicate to us. By these, and from those to ALEXANDER or to\r\n    me, we learned that the king wished to see the telescope at Windsor.\r\n    At last a letter, dated July 2, arrived from THERESE, and from this\r\n    and several succeeding ones we gathered that the king would not\r\n    suffer my brother to return to his profession again, and by his\r\n    writing several times for a supply of money we could only suppose\r\n    that he himself was in uncertainty about the time of his return.\r\n\r\n    \"In the last week of July my brother came home, and immediately\r\n    prepared for removing to Datchet, where he had taken a house with a\r\n    garden and grass-plat annexed, quite suitable for the purpose of an\r\n    observing-place. Sir WILLIAM WATSON spent nearly the whole time at\r\n    our house, and he was not the only friend who truly grieved at my\r\n    brother's going from Bath; or feared his having perhaps agreed to no\r\n    very advantageous offers; their fears were, in fact, not without\r\n    reason. . . . The prospect of entering again on the toils of teaching,\r\n    etc., which awaited my brother at home (the months of leisure being\r\n    now almost gone by), appeared to him an intolerable waste of time,\r\n    and by way of alternative he chose to be royal astronomer, with a\r\n    salary of £200 a year. Sir WILLIAM WATSON was the only one to whom\r\n    the sum was mentioned, and he exclaimed, 'Never bought monarch honor\r\n    so cheap!' To every other inquirer, my brother's answer was that the\r\n    king had provided for him.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August, 1782, the family removed to Datchet. The last\r\nmusical duty was performed on Whit-Sunday, 1782, in St. Margaret's\r\nChapel, Bath, when the anthem for the day was of HERSCHEL'S own\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nThe end of the introductory epoch of his life is reached. Henceforth he\r\nlived in his observatory, and from his forty-fourth year onwards he only\r\nleft it for short periods to go to London to submit his classic memoirs\r\nto the Royal Society. Even for these occasions he chose periods of\r\nmoonlight, when no observations could be made.\r\n\r\nHe was a private man no longer. Henceforth he belongs to the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Probably on the model of one of SHORT'S Gregorian\r\ntelescopes, which were then the best instruments of the kind.\r\n\r\n[11] For a description of the main points of HERSCHEL'S\r\nprocesses of making reflectors, which will illustrate his strong\r\nmechanical talents, see _Encyclopædia Britannica_, eighth edition,\r\narticle _Telescope_.\r\n\r\n[12] These have never been published, nor is it likely at this\r\nday, when our measuring instruments are so greatly improved, that they\r\nwould be of any material value to science, although of interest as\r\ngiving the proofs of HERSCHEL'S assiduity and skill. He was always more\r\nthan the maker of telescopes, for he was never content until they were\r\napplied to the problems of astronomy.\r\n\r\n[13] ARAGO has implied that if HERSCHEL had directed his\r\ntelescope to _Uranus_ only eleven days earlier than he did, this\r\ndiscovery would have escaped him, since at that time (March 2, 1781) the\r\nplanet was at its _station_, and had no motion relative to the star.\r\nThis is an entire misconception, since the new planet was detected by\r\nits physical appearance, and not by its motion. Does any one suppose\r\nthat \"a new and singular star\" like this would have been once viewed and\r\nthen forgotten?\r\n\r\n[14] Four of _Jupiter_, one of the earth, and one of _Saturn_.\r\n\r\n[15] JOHN MICHELL had been a member of the Royal Society since\r\n1760: he died in 1793. He was a philosophical thinker, as is shown by\r\nhis memoirs on the distances of the stars, and by his invention of the\r\nmethod for determining the earth's density. It is not certain that he\r\nwas personally known to HERSCHEL, although his writings were familiar to\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER WILSON was Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow, and is chiefly\r\nknown to us by his theory of the nature of the solar spots, which was\r\nadopted and enlarged by HERSCHEL. He died in 1786; but the families of\r\nWILSON and HERSCHEL remained close friends.\r\n\r\n[16] _Berliner Jahrbuch_, 1784, p. 211. In the _Connaissance\r\ndes Tems_ for 1784 he is called \"HOROCHELLE.\"\r\n\r\n[17] At the presentation Sir JOSEPH BANKS, the President of the\r\nRoyal Society, said: \"In the name of the Royal Society I present to you\r\nthis gold medal, the reward which they have assigned to your successful\r\nlabors, and I exhort you to continue diligently to cultivate those\r\nfields of science which have produced to you a harvest of so much honor.\r\nYour attention to the improvement of telescopes has already amply repaid\r\nthe labor which you have bestowed upon them; but the treasures of the\r\nheavens are well known to be inexhaustible. Who can say but your new\r\nstar, which exceeds _Saturn_ in its distance from the sun, may exceed\r\nhim as much in magnificence of attendance? Who knows what new rings, new\r\nsatellites, or what other nameless and numberless phenomena remain\r\nbehind, waiting to reward future industry and improvement?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n            LIFE AT DATCHET, CLAY HALL, AND SLOUGH; 1782-1822.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new house at Datchet, which was occupied from 1782 till 1785, was a\r\nsource of despair to CAROLINA HERSCHEL, who looked upon its desolate and\r\nisolated condition with a housekeeper's eyes. This was nothing to her\r\nbrother, who gayly consented to live upon \"eggs and bacon,\" now that he\r\nwas free at last to mind the heavens. The ruinous state of the place had\r\nno terrors in his eyes, for was there not a laundry which would serve as\r\na library, a large stable which was just the place for the grinding of\r\nmirrors, and a grass-plat for the small twenty-foot reflector?\r\n\r\nHere they set to work at astronomy; the brother with the twenty-foot,\r\nthe sister aiding him, and at odd times sweeping for comets. In the\r\ncourse of her life she discovered no less than eight, and five of these\r\nwere first seen by her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1787 HERSCHEL wrote his paper \"On three Volcanoes in the Moon,\"\r\nwhich he had observed in April of that year. In this he mentions\r\nprevious observations of the same sort. I do not remember that the\r\nfollowing account of these has ever been put on record in English.\r\nBaron VON ZACH writes from London to BODE:[18]\r\n\r\n    \"Probably you have heard also of the volcanoes in the moon, which\r\n    HERSCHEL has observed. . . . I will give you an account of it as I\r\n    heard it from his own lips. Dr. LIND, a worthy physician in Windsor,\r\n    who has made himself known through his two journeys in China, and\r\n    who is a friend of our HERSCHEL'S, was with his wife one evening on\r\n    a visit to HERSCHEL in Datchet [1783, May 4]. On this evening there\r\n    was to be an occultation of a star at the moon's dark limb. This was\r\n    observed by HERSCHEL and Doctor LIND. Mrs. LIND wished also to see\r\n    what was occurring, and placed herself at a telescope and watched\r\n    attentively.\r\n\r\n    \"Scarcely had the star disappeared before Mrs. LIND thought she saw\r\n    it again, and exclaimed that the star had gone in front of, and not\r\n    behind the moon. This provoked a short astronomical lecture on the\r\n    question, but still she would not credit it, because she _saw_\r\n    differently. Finally HERSCHEL stepped to the telescope, and in fact\r\n    he saw a bright point on the dark disc of the moon, which he\r\n    followed attentively. It gradually became fainter and finally\r\n    vanished.\". . .\r\n\r\nThe life at Datchet was not free from its annoyances.\r\n\r\n    \"Much of my brother's time was taken up in going, when the evenings\r\n    were clear, to the queen's lodge, to show the king, etc., objects\r\n    through the seven-foot. But when the days began to shorten, this was\r\n    found impossible, for the telescope was often (at no small expense\r\n    and risk of damage) obliged to be transported in the dark back to\r\n    Datchet, for the purpose of spending the rest of the night with\r\n    observations on double stars for a second catalogue. My brother was,\r\n    besides, obliged to be absent for a week or ten days, for the\r\n    purpose of bringing home the metal of the cracked thirty-foot\r\n    mirror, and the remaining materials from his work-room. Before the\r\n    furnace was taken down at Bath, a second twenty-foot mirror, twelve\r\n    inches diameter, was cast, which happened to be very fortunate, for\r\n    on the 1st of January, 1783, a very fine one cracked by frost in the\r\n    tube.\r\n\r\n    . . . \"In my brother's absence from home I was, of course, left alone\r\n    to amuse myself with my own thoughts, which were anything but\r\n    cheerful. I found I was to be trained for an assistant astronomer,\r\n    and, by way of encouragement, a telescope adapted for 'sweeping,'\r\n    consisting of a tube with two glasses, such as are commonly used in\r\n    a 'finder,' was given me. I was 'to sweep for comets,' and I see, by\r\n    my journal, that I began August 22d, 1782, to write down and\r\n    describe all remarkable appearances I saw in my 'sweeps,' which were\r\n    horizontal. But it was not till the last two months of the same year\r\n    that I felt the least encouragement to spend the star-light nights\r\n    on a grass-plot covered with dew or hoar-frost, without a human\r\n    being near enough to be within call. I knew too little of the real\r\n    heavens to be able to point out every object so as to find it again,\r\n    without losing much time by consulting the Atlas. But all these\r\n    troubles were removed when I knew my brother to be at no great\r\n    distance making observations, with his various instruments, on\r\n    double stars, planets, etc., and when I could have his assistance\r\n    immediately if I found a nebula or cluster of stars, of which I\r\n    intended to give a catalogue; but, at the end of 1783, I had only\r\n    marked fourteen, when my sweeping was interrupted by being employed\r\n    to write down my brother's observations with the large twenty-foot.\r\n    I had, however, the comfort to see that my brother was satisfied\r\n    with my endeavors to assist him when he wanted another person either\r\n    to run to the clocks, write down a memorandum, fetch and carry\r\n    instruments, or measure the ground with poles, etc., etc., of which\r\n    something of the kind every moment would occur. For the assiduity\r\n    with which the measurements on the diameter of the _Georgium Sidus_,\r\n    and observations of other planets, double stars, etc., etc., were\r\n    made, was incredible, as may be seen by the various papers that were\r\n    given to the Royal Society in 1783, which papers were written in the\r\n    daytime, or when cloudy nights interfered. Besides this, the\r\n    twelve-inch speculum was perfected before the spring, and many hours\r\n    were spent at the turning-bench, as not a night clear enough for\r\n    observing ever passed but that some improvements were planned for\r\n    perfecting the mounting and motions of the various instruments then\r\n    in use, or some trials were made of new constructed eye-pieces,\r\n    which were mostly executed by my brother's own hands. Wishing to\r\n    save his time, he began to have some work of that kind done by a\r\n    watchmaker who had retired from business and lived on Datchet\r\n    Common; but the work was so bad, and the charges so unreasonable,\r\n    that he could not be employed. It was not till some time afterwards,\r\n    in his frequent visits to the meetings of the Royal Society (made in\r\n    moonlight nights), that he had an opportunity of looking about for\r\n    mathematical workmen, opticians, and founders. But the work seldom\r\n    answered expectation, and it was kept, to be executed with\r\n    improvements by ALEXANDER during the few months he spent with us.\r\n\r\n    \"The summer months passed in the most active preparation for getting\r\n    the large twenty-foot ready against the next winter. The carpenters\r\n    and smiths of Datchet were in daily requisition, and, as soon as\r\n    patterns for tools and mirrors were ready, my brother went to town\r\n    to have them cast, and, during the three or four months ALEXANDER\r\n    could be absent from Bath, the mirrors and optical parts were nearly\r\n    completed.\r\n\r\n    \"But that the nights after a day of toil were not given to rest, may\r\n    be seen by the observations on _Mars_, of which a paper, dated\r\n    December 1, 1783, was given to the Royal Society. Some trouble,\r\n    also, was often thrown away, during those nights, in the attempt to\r\n    teach me to remeasure double stars with the same micrometers with\r\n    which former measures had been taken, and the small twenty-foot was\r\n    given me for that purpose. . . . I had also to ascertain their places\r\n    by a transit instrument lent for that purpose by Mr. DALRYMPLE; but,\r\n    after many fruitless attempts, it was seen that the instrument was,\r\n    perhaps, as much in fault as my observations.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1783 HERSCHEL says:\r\n\r\n    \"I have now finished my third review of the heavens. The first was\r\n    made with a Newtonian telescope something less than seven feet focal\r\n    length, a power of 222, and an aperture of four and a half inches.\r\n    It extended only to stars of the first, second, third, and fourth\r\n    magnitudes. My second review was made with an instrument much\r\n    superior to the other, of 85.2 inches focus, 6.2 inches aperture,\r\n    and power 227. It extended to all the stars of HARRIS'S maps and\r\n    the telescopic ones near them, as far as the eighth magnitude. The\r\n    Catalogue of Double Stars and the discovery of the _Georgium Sidus_,\r\n    were the results of that review. The third was with the same\r\n    instrument and aperture, but with a power of 460. This review\r\n    extended to all the stars of FLAMSTEED'S Catalogue, together with\r\n    every small star about them, to the amount of a great many thousands\r\n    of stars. I have, many a night, in the course of eleven or twelve\r\n    hours of observation, carefully and singly examined not less than\r\n    400 celestial objects, besides taking measures, and sometimes\r\n    viewing a particular star for half an hour together.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth review began with the twenty-foot, in 1784.\r\n\r\n    \"My brother began his series of sweeps when the instrument was yet\r\n    in a very unfinished state, and my feelings were not very\r\n    comfortable when every moment I was alarmed by a crack or fall,\r\n    knowing him to be elevated fifteen feet or more on a temporary\r\n    cross-beam, instead of a safe gallery. The ladders had not even\r\n    their braces at the bottom; and one night, in a very high wind, he\r\n    had hardly touched the ground before the whole apparatus came down.\r\n    Some laboring men were called up to help in extricating the mirror,\r\n    which was, fortunately, uninjured, but much work was cut out for\r\n    carpenters next day. I could give a pretty long list of accidents\r\n    which were near proving fatal to my brother as well as myself. To\r\n    make observations with such large machinery, where all around is in\r\n    darkness, is not unattended with danger, especially when personal\r\n    safety is the last thing with which the mind is occupied; even poor\r\n    PIAZZI did not go home without getting broken shins by falling over\r\n    the rack-bar.\r\n\r\n    \"In the long days of the summer months many ten and seven foot\r\n    mirrors were finished; there was nothing but grinding and polishing\r\n    to be seen. For ten-foot, several had been cast with ribbed backs,\r\n    by way of experiment, to reduce the weight in large mirrors. In my\r\n    leisure hours I ground seven-foot and plain mirrors from rough to\r\n    fining down, and was _indulged_ with polishing and the last\r\n    finishing of a very beautiful mirror for Sir WILLIAM WATSON.\r\n\r\n    \"An account of the discoveries made with the twenty-foot and the\r\n    improvements of the mechanical parts of the instrument during the\r\n    winter of 1785 is given with the catalogue of the first 1,000 new\r\n    nebulæ. By which account it must plainly appear that the expenses of\r\n    these improvements, and those which were yet to be made in the\r\n    apparatus of the twenty-foot (which, in fact, proved to be a model\r\n    of a larger instrument), could not be supplied out of a salary of\r\n    £200 a year, especially as my brother's finances had been too much\r\n    reduced during the six months before he received his _first_\r\n    quarterly payment of _fifty pounds_ (which was Michaelmas, 1782).\r\n    Travelling from Bath to London, Greenwich, Windsor, backwards and\r\n    forwards, transporting the telescope, etc., breaking up his\r\n    establishment at Bath and forming a new one near the court, all\r\n    this, even leaving such personal conveniences as he had for many\r\n    years been used to, out of the question, could not be obtained for a\r\n    trifle; a good large piece of ground was required for the use of the\r\n    instruments, and a habitation in which he could receive and offer a\r\n    bed to an astronomical friend, was necessary after a night's\r\n    observation.\r\n\r\n    \"It seemed to be supposed that enough had been done when my brother\r\n    was enabled to leave his profession that he might have time to make\r\n    and sell telescopes. The king ordered four ten-foot himself, and\r\n    many seven-foot besides had been bespoke, and much time had already\r\n    been expended on polishing the mirrors for the same. But all this\r\n    was only retarding the work of a thirty or forty foot instrument,\r\n    which it was my brother's chief object to obtain as soon as\r\n    possible; for he was then on the wrong side of forty-five, and felt\r\n    how great an injustice he would be doing to himself and to the cause\r\n    of astronomy by giving up his time to making telescopes for other\r\n    observers.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir WILLIAM WATSON, who often in the lifetime of his father came to\r\n    make some stay with us at Datchet, saw my brother's difficulties,\r\n    and expressed great dissatisfaction. On his return to Bath he met,\r\n    among the visitors there, several belonging to the court, to whom he\r\n    gave his opinion concerning his friend and his situation very\r\n    freely. In consequence of this, my brother had soon after, through\r\n    Sir J. BANKS, the promise that £2,000 would be granted for enabling\r\n    him to make himself an instrument.\r\n\r\n    \"Immediately every preparation for beginning the great work\r\n    commenced. A very ingenious smith (CAMPION), who was seeking\r\n    employment, was secured by my brother, and a temporary forge erected\r\n    in an upstairs room.\"\r\n\r\nThe sale of these telescopes of HERSCHEL'S must have produced a large\r\nsum, for he had made before 1795 more than two hundred seven-feet, one\r\nhundred and fifty ten-feet, and eighty twenty-feet mirrors. For many of\r\nthe telescopes sent abroad no stands were constructed. The mirrors and\r\neye-pieces alone were furnished, and a drawing of the stand sent with\r\nthem by which the mirrors could be mounted.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 the cost of a seven-foot telescope, six and four-tenths inches\r\naperture, stand, eye-pieces, etc., complete, was two hundred guineas, a\r\nten-foot was six hundred guineas, and a twenty-foot about 2,500 to 3,000\r\nguineas. He had made four ten-foot telescopes like this for the king.\r\nIn 1787 SCHROETER got the mirrors and eye-pieces only for a\r\nfour-and-three-quarter-inch reflector for five guineas; those for his\r\nseven-foot telescope were twenty-three guineas. Later a seven-foot\r\ntelescope, complete, was sold for one hundred guineas, and the\r\ntwenty-five-foot reflector, made for the Madrid observatory, cost them\r\n75,000 francs = $15,000.[19] It was ordered in 1796, but not delivered\r\nfor several years, the Spanish government being short of money. For a\r\nten and a seven foot telescope, the Prince of Canino paid £2,310.\r\n\r\nVON MAGELLAN writes to BODE concerning a visit to HERSCHEL:[20]\r\n\r\n    \"I spent the night of the 6th of January at HERSCHEL'S, in Datchet,\r\n    near Windsor, and had the good luck to hit on a fine evening. He has\r\n    his twenty-foot Newtonian telescope in the open air and mounted in\r\n    his garden very simply and conveniently. It is moved by an\r\n    assistant, who stands below it. . . . Near the instrument is a clock\r\n    regulated to sidereal time. . . . In the room near it sits HERSCHEL'S\r\n    sister, and she has FLAMSTEED'S Atlas open before her. As he gives\r\n    her the word, she writes down the declination and right ascension\r\n    and the other circumstances of the observation. In this way\r\n    HERSCHEL examines the whole sky without omitting the least part. He\r\n    commonly observes with a magnifying power of one hundred and fifty,\r\n    and is sure that after four or five years he will have passed in\r\n    review every object above our horizon. He showed me the book in\r\n    which his observations up to this time are written, and I am\r\n    astonished at the great number of them. Each sweep covers 2° 15' in\r\n    declination, and he lets each star pass at least three times through\r\n    the field of his telescope, so that it is impossible that anything\r\n    can escape him. He has already found about 900 double stars and\r\n    almost as many nebulæ. I went to bed about one o'clock, and up to\r\n    that time, he had found that night four or five new nebulæ. The\r\n    thermometer in the garden stood at 13° Fahrenheit; but, in spite of\r\n    this, HERSCHEL observes the whole night through, except that he\r\n    stops every three or four hours and goes in the room for a few\r\n    moments. For some years HERSCHEL has observed the heavens every hour\r\n    when the weather is clear, and this always in the open air, because\r\n    he says that the telescope only performs well when it is at the same\r\n    temperature as the air. He protects himself against the weather by\r\n    putting on more clothing. He has an excellent constitution, and\r\n    thinks about nothing else in the world but the celestial bodies. He\r\n    has promised me in the most cordial way, entirely in the service of\r\n    astronomy, and without thinking of his own interest, to see to the\r\n    telescopes I have ordered for European observatories, and he will\r\n    himself attend to the preparation of the mirrors.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, 1783, May 8, that HERSCHEL married. His wife was\r\nthe daughter of Mr. JAMES BALDWIN, a merchant of the city of London, and\r\nthe widow of JOHN PITT, Esq. She is described as a lady of singular\r\namiability and gentleness of character. She was entirely interested in\r\nhis scientific pursuits, and the jointure which she brought removed all\r\nfurther anxiety about money affairs. They had but one child, JOHN\r\nFREDERICK WILLIAM, born March 7, 1792.[21]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe house at Datchet became more and more unfit for the needs of the\r\nfamily, and in June, 1785, a move was made to Clay Hall, in Old Windsor.\r\nThe residence here was but short, and finally a last change was made to\r\nSlough on April, 3d, 1786.\r\n\r\nThe ardor of the work during these years can be judged of by a single\r\nsentence from CAROLINA HERSCHEL'S diary:\r\n\r\n    \"The last night at Clay Hall was spent in sweeping till daylight,\r\n    and by the next evening the telescope stood ready for observation at\r\n    Slough.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1786 until his death, HERSCHEL remained at Slough; his life, truly\r\nspeaking, was in his observatory.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed true, as ARAGO has said in his eloquent tribute to him: \"On\r\npeut dire hardiment du jardin et de la petite maison de Slough, que\r\nc'est le lieu du monde où il a été fait le plus de découvertes. Le nom\r\nde ce village ne périra pas; les sciences le transmettront\r\nreligieusement à nos derniers neveux.\"\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL'S first contribution to the _Philosophical Transactions_ was\r\nprinted in the volume for 1780, his last in that for 1818. Of these\r\nthirty-nine volumes, there are only two (1813 and 1817) which contain no\r\npaper from his hand, and many volumes contain more than one, as he\r\npublished no less than sixty-eight memoirs in this place.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it must not be thought that his was an austere and grave\r\nexistence. Music, which he loved to enthusiasm, was still a delight to\r\nhim. All the more that his devotion was free. The glimpses which we get\r\nof his life with his friends show him always cheerful, ardent, and\r\ndevoted. Even in his later years, he had not lost a \"boyish earnestness\r\nto explain;\" his simplicity and the charm of his manner struck every\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"HERSCHEL, you know, and everybody knows, is one of the most pleasing\r\nand well-bred natural characters of the present age,\" says Dr. BURNEY,\r\nwho had opportunity to know.\r\n\r\nThe portrait which is given in the frontispiece must have been painted\r\nabout this time (1788), and the eager, ardent face shows his inner life\r\nfar better than any words can do.\r\n\r\nEven in his scientific writings, which everything conspired to render\r\ngrave and sober, the almost poetic nature of his mind shows forth. In\r\none of his (unpublished) note-books, now in the Royal Society's library,\r\nI found this entry:\r\n\r\n    \"640th Sweep--November 28, 1786.--The nebula of _Orion_, which I saw\r\n    by the front view, was so glaring and beautiful that I could not\r\n    think of taking any place of its extent.\"\r\n\r\nHe was quite alone under the perfectly silent sky when this was written,\r\nand he was at his post simply to make this and other such observations.\r\nBut the sky was beautiful to him, and his faithful sister, CAROLINA,\r\nsitting below, has preserved for us the words as they dropped from his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January, 1787, HERSCHEL discovered two satellites to\r\n_Uranus_.\r\n\r\nAfter he had well assured himself of their existence, but before he\r\ncommunicated his discovery to the world, he made this crucial test. He\r\nprepared a sketch of _Uranus_ attended by his two satellites, as it\r\nwould appear on the night of February 10, 1787, and when the night\r\ncame, \"the heavens displayed the original of my drawings, by showing in\r\nthe situation I had delineated them _the Georgian planet attended by two\r\nsatellites_. I confess that this scene appeared to me with additional\r\nbeauty, as the little secondary planets seemed to give a dignity to the\r\nprimary one which raises it into a more conspicuous situation among the\r\ngreat bodies of the solar system.\". . .\r\n\r\nIn a memoir of 1789, he has a few sentences which show the living way\r\nin which the heavens appeared to him:\r\n\r\n    \"This method of viewing the heavens seems to throw them into a new\r\n    kind of light.\r\n\r\n    \"They are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden, which contains\r\n    the greatest variety of productions in different flourishing beds;\r\n    and one advantage we may at least reap from it is, that we can, as\r\n    it were, extend the range of our experience to an immense duration.\r\n    For is it not almost the same thing whether we live successively to\r\n    witness the germination, blooming, foliage, fecundity, fading,\r\n    withering, and corruption of a plant, or whether a vast number of\r\n    specimens selected from every stage through which the plant passes\r\n    in the course of its existence be brought at once to our view?\"\r\n\r\nThe thought here is no less finely expressed than it is profound. The\r\nsimile is perfect, if we have the power to separate among the vast\r\nvariety each state of being from every other, and if the very luxuriance\r\nof illustration in the heavens does not bewilder and overpower the mind.\r\nIt was precisely this discriminating power that HERSCHEL possessed in\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of humor in the way he records a change of opinion:\r\n\r\n    \"I formerly supposed the surface of _Saturn's_ ring to be rough,\r\n    owing to luminous points like mountains seen on it, till one of\r\n    these was kind enough to venture off the edge of the ring and appear\r\n    as a satellite.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1782 he replies with a certain concealed sharpness to the idea that\r\nhe used magnifying powers which were too high. There is a tone almost of\r\nimpatience, as if he were conscious he was replying to a criticism based\r\non ignorance:\r\n\r\n    \"We are told that we gain nothing by magnifying too much. I grant\r\n    it; but shall never believe I magnify too much till by experience I\r\n    find that I can see better with a lower power.\" (1782.)\r\n\r\nBy 1786, when he returns to this subject, in answer to a formal request\r\nto explain his use of high magnifiers, he is quite over any irritation,\r\nand treats the subject almost with playfulness:\r\n\r\n    \"Soon after my first essay of using high powers with the Newtonian\r\n    telescope, I began to doubt whether an opinion which has been\r\n    entertained by several eminent authors, 'that vision will grow\r\n    indistinct when the optic pencils are less than the fiftieth part of\r\n    an inch,' would hold good in all cases. I perceived that according\r\n    to this criterion I was not entitled to see distinctly with a power\r\n    of much more than about 320 in a seven-foot telescope of an aperture\r\n    of six and four-tenths inches, whereas in many experiments I found\r\n    myself very well pleased with magnifiers which far exceeded such\r\n    narrow limits. This induced me, as it were, by way of apology to\r\n    myself for seeing well where I ought to have seen less distinctly,\r\n    to make a few experiments.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that these experiments proved that from the point\r\nof view taken by HERSCHEL, he was quite right, and that his high powers\r\nhad numerous valuable applications. He goes on to say:\r\n\r\n    \"Had it not been for a late conversation with some of my highly\r\n    esteemed and learned friends, I might probably have left the papers\r\n    on which these experiments were recorded, among the rest of those\r\n    that are laid aside, when they have afforded me the information I\r\n    want.\"\r\n\r\nThe last sentence seems to be a kind of notice to his learned friends\r\nthat there is yet more unsaid. As a warning to those to whose criticisms\r\nhe had replied, he gives them this picture of the kind of assiduity\r\nwhich will be required, if some of his observations on double stars are\r\nto be repeated:\r\n\r\n    \"It is in vain to look for these stars if every circumstance is not\r\n    favorable. The observer as well as the instrument must have been\r\n    long enough out in the open air to acquire the same temperature. In\r\n    very cold weather an hour at least will be required.\" (1782.)\r\n\r\nWe may gain some further insight into his character from the following\r\nchance extracts from his writings:\r\n\r\n    \"I have all along had truth and reality in view as the sole object\r\n    of my endeavors.\" (1782.)\r\n\r\n    \"Not being satisfied when I thought it possible to obtain more\r\n    accurate measures, I employed [a more delicate apparatus].\" (1783.)\r\n\r\n    \"To this end I have already begun a series of observations upon\r\n    several zones of double stars, and should the result of them be\r\n    against these conjectures, I shall be the first to point out their\r\n    fallacy.\" (1783.)\r\n\r\n    \"There is a great probability of succeeding still farther in this\r\n    laborious but delightful research, so as to be able at last to say\r\n    not only how much the annual parallax _is not_, but how much it\r\n    really _is_.\" (1782.)\r\n\r\nThe nature of his philosophizing, and the limits which he set to\r\nhimself, may be more clearly seen in further extracts:\r\n\r\n    \"By taking more time [before printing these observations] I should\r\n    undoubtedly be enabled to speak more confidently of the _interior_\r\n    _construction of the heavens_, and of its various _nebulous_ and\r\n    sidereal strata. As an apology for this prematurity it may be said\r\n    that, the end of all discoveries being communication, we can never\r\n    be too ready in giving facts and observations, whatever we may be in\r\n    reasoning upon them.\" (1785.)\r\n\r\n    \"In an investigation of this delicate nature we ought to avoid two\r\n    opposite extremes. If we indulge a fanciful imagination, and build\r\n    worlds of our own, we must not wonder at our going wide from the\r\n    path of truth and nature. On the other hand, if we add observation\r\n    to observation without attempting to draw not only certain\r\n    conclusions but also conjectural views from them, we offend against\r\n    the very end for which only observations ought to be made. I will\r\n    endeavor to keep a proper medium, but if I should deviate from that,\r\n    I could wish not to fall into the latter error.\" (1785.)\r\n\r\n    \"As observations carefully made should always take the lead of\r\n    theories, I shall not be concerned if what I have to say contradicts\r\n    what has been said in my last paper on this subject.\" (1790.)\r\n\r\nNo course of reasoning could be more simple, more exact, more profound,\r\nand more beautiful than this which follows:\r\n\r\n    \"As it has been shown that the spherical figure of a cluster is\r\n    owing to the action of central powers, it follows that those\r\n    clusters which, _cæteris paribus_, are the most complete in this\r\n    figure, must have been the longest exposed to the action of these\r\n    causes. Thus the maturity of a sidereal system may be judged from\r\n    the disposition of the component parts.\r\n\r\n    \"Hence planetary nebulæ may be looked on as very aged. Though we\r\n    cannot see any individual nebula pass through all its stages of\r\n    life, we can select particular ones in each peculiar stage.\" (1789.)\r\n\r\nThere is something almost grandiose and majestic in his statement of\r\nthe ultimate destiny of the Galaxy:\r\n\r\n                  \"To him the fates were known\r\n             Of orbs dim hovering on the skirts of space.\"\r\n\r\n    \"--Since the stars of the Milky Way are permanently exposed to the\r\n    action of a power whereby they are irresistibly drawn into groups,\r\n    we may be certain that from mere clustering stars they will be\r\n    gradually compressed, through successive stages of accumulation,\r\n    till they come up to what may be called the ripening period of the\r\n    globular form, and total insulation; from which it is evident that\r\n    the Milky Way must be finally broken up and cease to be a stratum of\r\n    scattered stars.\r\n\r\n    \"The state into which the incessant action of the clustering power\r\n    has brought it at present, is a kind of chronometer that may be used\r\n    to measure the time of its past and future existence; and although\r\n    we do not know the rate of going of this mysterious chronometer, it\r\n    is nevertheless certain that since the breaking up of the Milky Way\r\n    affords a proof that it cannot last forever, it equally bears\r\n    witness that its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.\"\r\n    (1814.)\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL'S relations with his cotemporaries were usually of the most\r\npleasant character, though seldom intimate. This peace was broken but by\r\none unpleasant occurrence. In the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1792,\r\nSCHROETER had communicated a series of observations made with one of\r\nHERSCHEL'S own telescopes on the atmospheres of _Venus_, the Moon, etc.\r\nIt was not only an account of phenomena which had been seen; it was\r\naccompanied by measures, and the computations based on these led to\r\nheights and dimensions for mountains on _Venus_ which were, to say the\r\nleast, extravagant. The adjective will not seem too strong when we say\r\nthat the very existence of the mountains themselves is to-day more than\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nThe appearances seen by SCHROETER were described by him in perfectly\r\ngood faith, and similar ones have been since recorded. His reasoning\r\nupon them was defective, and the measures which he made were practically\r\nvalueless. This paper, printed in the _Transactions_ of the Royal\r\nSociety, to which SCHROETER had not before contributed, appears to have\r\nirritated HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there were not wanting members of his own society who hinted\r\nthat on the Continent, too, there were to be found great observers, and\r\nthat here, at least, HERSCHEL had been anticipated even in his own\r\nfield. I have always thought that the memoir of HERSCHEL which appeared\r\nin the next volume of the _Transactions_ (1793), _Observations on the\r\nPlanet Venus_, was a rejoinder intended far more for the detractors at\r\nhome than for the astronomer abroad. The review is conceived in a severe\r\nspirit. The first idea seems to be to crush an opposition which he\r\nfeels. The truth is established, but its establishment is hardly the\r\n_first_ object.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if HERSCHEL had almost allowed himself to be forced into a\r\nposition of arrogance, which his whole life shows was entirely foreign\r\nto his nature. All through the review he does not once mention\r\nSCHROETER'S name. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"A series of observations on _Venus_, begun by me in April, 1777,\r\n    has been continued down to the present time. . . . The result of my\r\n    observations would have been communicated long ago if I had not\r\n    flattered myself with the hope of some better success concerning the\r\n    diurnal motion of _Venus_, which has still eluded my constant\r\n    attention as far as concerns its period and direction. . . . Even at\r\n    this present time I should hesitate to give the following extracts\r\n    if it did not seem incumbent on me to examine by what accident I\r\n    came to overlook mountains in this planet of such enormous height as\r\n    to exceed four, five, or even six times the perpendicular height of\r\n    Chimboraço, the highest of our mountains. . . . The same paper contains\r\n    other particulars concerning _Venus_ and _Saturn_. All of which\r\n    being things of which I have never taken any notice, it will not be\r\n    amiss to show, by what follows, that neither want of attention, nor\r\n    a deficiency of instruments, would occasion my not perceiving these\r\n    mountains of more than twenty-three miles in height, this jagged\r\n    border of _Venus_, and these flat, spherical forms on _Saturn_.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of SCHROETER (1795) is temperate and just. It does him honor,\r\nand he generously gives full justice to his critic.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be worth while to mention this slight incident if it\r\nwere not that during these years there certainly existed a feeling\r\nthat HERSCHEL undervalued the labors of his cotemporaries.\r\n\r\nThis impression was fostered no doubt by his general habit of not\r\nquoting previous authorities in the fields which he was working.\r\n\r\nA careful reading of his papers will, I think, show that his definite\r\nindebtedness to his _cotemporaries_ was vanishingly small. The work of\r\nMICHELL and WILSON he alludes to again and again, and always with\r\nappreciation. Certainly he seems to show a vein of annoyance that the\r\npapers of CHRISTIAN MAYER, _De novis in coelo sidereo phænomenis_\r\n(1779), and _Beobachtungen von Fixsterntrabanten_ (1778), should have\r\nbeen quoted to prove that the method proposed by HERSCHEL in 1782 for\r\nascertaining the parallax of the fixed stars by means of observations of\r\nthose which were double, was not entirely original with himself.\r\n\r\nThere is direct proof that it was so,[22] and if this was not\r\nforthcoming it would be unnecessary, as he has amply shown in his\r\nCatalogue of Double Stars. One is reminded of his remarks on the use of\r\nthe high magnifying powers by the impatience of his comments.\r\n\r\nHis proposal to call the newly discovered minor planets _asteroids_\r\n(1802) was received as a sign that he wished to discriminate between the\r\ndiscoveries of PIAZZI and OLBERS and his own discovery of URANUS.[23]\r\n\r\nHe takes pains to quietly put this on one side in one of his papers,\r\nshowing that he was cognizant of the existence of such a feeling.\r\n\r\nI am tempted to resurrect from a deserved obscurity a notice of\r\nHERSCHEL'S _Observations on the Two Lately Discovered Celestial Bodies_\r\n(_Philosophical Transactions_, 1802), printed in the first volume\r\nof the _Edinburgh Review_, simply to show the kind of envy to which even\r\nhe, the glory of England, was subject.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer sets forth the principal results of HERSCHEL'S\r\nobservations, and, after quoting his definition of the new term\r\nasteroid, goes on to say:\r\n\r\n    \"If a new name must be found, why not call them by some appellation\r\n    which shall, in some degree, be descriptive of, or at least\r\n    consistent with, their properties? Why not, for instance, call them\r\n    _Concentric Comets_, or _Planetary Comets_, or _Cometary Planets_?\r\n    or, if a single term must be found, why may we not coin such a\r\n    phrase as _Planetoid_ or _Cometoid_?\"\r\n\r\nThen follows a general arraignment of HERSCHEL'S methods of expression\r\nand thought, as distinguished from his powers of mere observation. This\r\ndistinction, it may be said, exists only in the reviewer's mind; there\r\nwas no such distinction in fact. If ever a series of observations was\r\ndirected by profound and reasonable thought, it was HERSCHEL'S own.\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. HERSCHEL'S passion for coining words and idioms has often\r\n    struck us as a weakness wholly unworthy of him. The invention of a\r\n    name is but a poor achievement for him who has discovered whole\r\n    worlds. Why, for instance, do we hear him talking of the\r\n    _space-penetrating power_ of his instrument--a compound epithet and\r\n    metaphor which he ought to have left to the poets, who, in some\r\n    future age, shall acquire glory by celebrating his name. The other\r\n    papers of Dr. HERSCHEL, in the late volumes of the _Transactions_,\r\n    do not deserve such particular attention. His catalogue of 500 new\r\n    nebulæ, though extremely valuable to the practical astronomer, leads\r\n    to no general conclusions of importance, and abounds with the\r\n    defects which are peculiar to the Doctor's writings--a great\r\n    prolixity and tediousness of narration--loose and often\r\n    unphilosophical reflections, which give no very favorable idea of\r\n    his scientific powers, however great his merit may be as an\r\n    observer--above all, that idle fondness for inventing names without\r\n    any manner of occasion, to which we have already alluded, and a use\r\n    of novel and affected idioms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"To the speculations of the Doctor on the nature of the Sun, we have\r\n    many similar objections; but they are all eclipsed by the grand\r\n    absurdity which he has there committed, in his hasty and erroneous\r\n    theory concerning the influence of the solar spots on the price of\r\n    grain. Since the publication of Gulliver's voyage to Laputa, nothing\r\n    so ridiculous has ever been offered to the world. We heartily wish\r\n    the Doctor had suppressed it; or, if determined to publish it, that\r\n    he had detailed it in language less confident and flippant.\"\r\n\r\nOne is almost ashamed to give space and currency to a forgotten attack,\r\nbut it yields a kind of perspective; and it is instructive and perhaps\r\nuseful to view HERSCHEL'S labors from all sides, even from wrong and\r\nenvious ones.\r\n\r\nThe study of the original papers, together with a knowledge of the\r\ncircumstances in which they were written, will abundantly show that\r\nHERSCHEL'S ideas sprung from a profound meditation of the nature of\r\nthings in themselves. What the origin of trains of thought prosecuted\r\nfor years may have been we cannot say, nor could he himself have\r\nexpressed it. A new path in science was to be found out, and he found\r\nit. It was not in his closet, surrounded by authorities, but under the\r\nopen sky, that he meditated the construction of the heavens. As he says,\r\n\"My situation permitted me not to consult large libraries; nor, indeed,\r\nwas it very material; for as I intended to view the heavens myself,\r\nNature, that great volume, appeared to me to contain the best\r\ncatalogue.\"\r\n\r\nHis remarkable memoirs on the invisible and other rays of the solar\r\nspectrum were received with doubt, and with open denial by many of the\r\nscientific bodies of Europe. The reviews and notices of his work in this\r\ndirection were often quite beyond the bounds of a proper scientific\r\ncriticism; but HERSCHEL maintained a dignified silence. The discoveries\r\nwere true, the proofs were open to all, and no response was needed from\r\nhim. He may have been sorely tempted to reply, but I am apt to believe\r\nthat the rumors that reached him from abroad and at home did not then\r\naffect him as they might have done earlier. He was at his grand\r\nclimacteric, he had passed his sixty-third year, his temper was less\r\nhasty than it had been in his youth, and his nerves had not yet received\r\nthe severe strain from whose effects he suffered during the last years\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have some glimpses of his personal life in the reminiscences of him\r\nin the _Diary and Letters_ of Madame D'ARBLAY, who knew him well:\r\n\r\n    \"1786.--In the evening Mr. HERSCHEL came to tea. I had once seen\r\n    that very extraordinary man at Mrs. DE LUC'S, but was happy to see\r\n    him again, for he has not more fame to awaken curiosity than sense\r\n    and modesty to gratify it. He is perfectly unassuming, yet openly\r\n    happy, and happy in the success of those studies which would render\r\n    a mind less excellently formed presumptuous and arrogant.\r\n\r\n    \"The king has not a happier subject than this man, who owes it\r\n    wholly to His Majesty that he is not wretched; for such was his\r\n    eagerness to quit all other pursuits to follow astronomy solely,\r\n    that he was in danger of ruin, when his talents and great and\r\n    uncommon genius attracted the king's patronage. He has now not only\r\n    his pension, which gives him the felicity of devoting all his time\r\n    to his darling study, but he is indulged in license from the king to\r\n    make a telescope according to his new ideas and discoveries, that is\r\n    to have no cost spared in its construction, and is wholly to be paid\r\n    for by His Majesty.\r\n\r\n    \"This seems to have made him happier even than the pension, as it\r\n    enables him to put in execution all his wonderful projects, from\r\n    which his expectations of future discoveries are so sanguine as to\r\n    make his present existence a state of almost perfect enjoyment.\r\n    Mr. LOCKE himself would be quite charmed with him.\r\n\r\n    \"He seems a man without a wish that has its object in the\r\n    terrestrial globe. At night Mr. HERSCHEL, by the king's command,\r\n    came to exhibit to His Majesty and the royal family the new comet\r\n    lately discovered by his sister, Miss HERSCHEL; and while I was\r\n    playing at piquet with Mrs. SCHWELLENBURG, the Princess AUGUSTA came\r\n    into the room and asked her if she chose to go into the garden and\r\n    look at it. She declined the offer, and the princess then made it to\r\n    me. I was glad to accept it for all sorts of reasons. We found him\r\n    at his telescope. The comet was very small, and had nothing grand or\r\n    striking in its appearance; but it is the first lady's comet, and I\r\n    was very desirous to see it. Mr. HERSCHEL then showed me some of his\r\n    new discovered universes, with all the good humor with which he\r\n    would have taken the same trouble for a brother or a sister\r\n    astronomer; there is no possibility of admiring his genius more than\r\n    his gentleness.\"\r\n\r\n    \"_1786, December 30th_.--This morning my dear father carried me to\r\n    Dr. HERSCHEL. That great and very extraordinary man received us\r\n    almost with open arms. He is very fond of my father, who is one of\r\n    the council of the Royal Society this year, as well as himself. . . .\r\n    At this time of day there was nothing to see but his instruments;\r\n    those, however, are curiosities sufficient. . . . I wished very much\r\n    to have seen his sister, . . . but she had been up all night, and\r\n    was then in bed.\"\r\n\r\n    \"_1787, September_.--Dr. HERSCHEL is a delightful man; so\r\n    unassuming with his great knowledge, so willing to dispense it to\r\n    the ignorant, and so cheerful and easy in his general manners, that,\r\n    were he no genius, it would be impossible not to remark him as a\r\n    pleasing and sensible man.\"\r\n\r\n    \"_1788, October 3d_.--We returned to Windsor at noon, and Mrs. DE\r\n    LUC sent me a most pressing invitation to tea and to hear a little\r\n    music. Two young ladies were to perform at her house in a little\r\n    concert. Dr. HERSCHEL was there, and accompanied them very sweetly\r\n    on the violin; his new-married wife was with him, and his sister.\r\n    His wife seems good-natured; she was rich, too! and astronomers are\r\n    as able as other men to discern that gold can glitter as well as\r\n    stars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DR.

They\r\n    rejoiced at the accident which had brought me there, and hoped I\r\n    would send my carriage away and take a bed with them.

After dinner we all agreed\r\n    to go to the terrace [at Windsor]--Mr., Mrs., and Miss H., with\r\n    their nice little boy, and three young ladies.

I must tell you\r\n    that HERSCHEL proposed to me to go with him to the king's concert at\r\n    night, he having permission to go when he chooses, his five nephews\r\n    (GRIESBACHS) making a principal part of the band. 'And,' says he,\r\n    'I know you will be welcome.'\"\r\n\r\nAn intimacy was gradually established between HERSCHEL and Dr. BURNEY.\r\nThey saw each other often at the meetings of the Royal Society, and\r\nHERSCHEL frequently stayed at the doctor's house. \"On the first evening\r\nHERSCHEL spent at Chelsea, when I called for my ARGAND lamp, HERSCHEL,\r\nwho had not seen one of those lamps, was surprised at the great effusion\r\nof light, and immediately calculated the difference between that and a\r\nsingle candle, and found it sixteen to one.\"[25]\r\n\r\nIn 1793 we find HERSCHEL as a witness for his friend JAMES WATT, in the\r\ncelebrated case of WATT _vs._ BULL, which was tried in the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas. And from MUIRHEAD'S Life of WATT, it appears that HERSCHEL\r\nvisited WATT at Heathfield in 1810.\r\n\r\nA delightful picture of the old age of HERSCHEL is given by the poet\r\nCAMPBELL,[26] whose nature was fitted to perceive the beauties of a\r\ngrand and simple character like HERSCHEL'S:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      \"[BRIGHTON], _September 15, 1813_.\r\n\r\n    . . . \"I wish you had been with me the day before yesterday, when you\r\n    would have joined me, I am sure, deeply in admiring a great, simple,\r\n    good old man--Dr. HERSCHEL. Do not think me vain, or at least put up\r\n    with my vanity, in saying that I almost flatter myself I have made\r\n    him my friend. I have got an invitation, and a pressing one, to go\r\n    to his house; and the lady who introduced me to him, says he spoke\r\n    of me as if he would really be happy to see me. . . . I spent all\r\n    Sunday with him and his family. His son is a prodigy in sciences,\r\n    and fond of poetry, but very unassuming. . . . Now, for the old\r\n    astronomer himself. His simplicity, his kindness, his anecdotes, his\r\n    readiness to explain--and make perfectly conspicuous too--his own\r\n    sublime conceptions of the universe are indescribably charming. He\r\n    is seventy-six, but fresh and stout; and there he sat, nearest the\r\n    door, at his friend's house, alternately smiling at a joke, or\r\n    contentedly sitting without share or notice in the conversation.\r\n    Any train of conversation he follows implicitly; anything you ask he\r\n    labors with a sort of boyish earnestness to explain.\r\n\r\n    \"I was anxious to get from him as many particulars as I could about\r\n    his interview with BUONAPARTE.[27] The latter, it was reported, had\r\n    astonished him by his astronomical knowledge.\r\n\r\n    \"'No,' he said, 'the First Consul did surprise me by his quickness\r\n    and versatility on all subjects; but in science he seemed to know\r\n    little more than any well-educated gentleman, and of astronomy much\r\n    less for instance than our own king. His general air,' he said, 'was\r\n    something like affecting to know more than he did know.' He was\r\n    high, and tried to be great with HERSCHEL, I suppose, without\r\n    success; and 'I remarked,' said the astronomer, 'his hypocrisy in\r\n    concluding the conversation on astronomy by observing how all these\r\n    glorious views gave proofs of an Almighty Wisdom.' I asked him if he\r\n    thought the system of LAPLACE to be quite certain, with regard to\r\n    the total security of the planetary system from the effects of\r\n    gravitation losing its present balance? He said, No; he thought by\r\n    no means that the universe was secured from the chance of sudden\r\n    losses of parts.\r\n\r\n    \"He was convinced that there had existed a planet between _Mars_\r\n    and _Jupiter_, in our own system, of which the little asteroids, or\r\n    planetkins, lately discovered, are indubitably fragments; and\r\n    'Remember,' said he, 'that though they have discovered only four of\r\n    those parts, there will be thousands--perhaps thirty thousand\r\n    more--yet discovered.' This planet he believed to have been lost by\r\n    explosion.\r\n\r\n    \"With great kindness and patience he referred me, in the course of\r\n    my attempts to talk with him, to a theorem in NEWTON'S 'Principles\r\n    of Natural Philosophy' in which the time that the light takes to\r\n    travel from the sun is proved with a simplicity which requires but a\r\n    few steps in reasoning. In talking of some inconceivably distant\r\n    bodies, he introduced the mention of this plain theorem, to remind\r\n    me that the progress of light could be measured in the one case as\r\n    well as the other. Then, speaking of himself, he said, with a\r\n    modesty of manner which quite overcame me, when taken together with\r\n    the greatness of the assertion: 'I have looked _further into space\r\n    than ever human being did before me_. I have observed stars, of\r\n    which the light, it can be proved, must take two millions of years\r\n    to reach this earth.'\r\n\r\n    \"I really and unfeignedly felt at this moment as if I had been\r\n    conversing with a supernatural intelligence. 'Nay, more,' said he,\r\n    'if those distant bodies had ceased to exist two millions of years\r\n    ago, we should still see them, as the light would travel after the\r\n    body was gone. . . .' These were HERSCHEL'S words; and if you had\r\n    heard him speak them, you would not think he was apt to tell more\r\n    than the truth.\r\n\r\n    \"After leaving HERSCHEL I felt elevated and overcome; and have in\r\n    writing to you made only this memorandum of some of the most\r\n    interesting moments of my life.\"\r\n\r\nCAMPBELL'S conscientious biographer appears to have felt that the value\r\nof this charming account of his interview with HERSCHEL was in its\r\nreport of astronomical facts and opinions, and he adds a foot-note to\r\nexplain that \"HERSCHEL'S opinion never amounted to more than\r\n_hypothesis_ having some degree of probability. Sir JOHN HERSCHEL\r\nremembers his father saying, 'If that hypothesis were true, and _if_ the\r\nplanet destroyed were as large as the earth, there must have been at\r\nleast thirty-thousand such fragments,' but always as an hypothesis--he\r\nwas never heard to declare any degree of conviction that it was so.\"\r\n\r\nFor us, the value of this sympathetic account of a day in HERSCHEL'S\r\nlife is in its conception of the simplicity, the modesty, the \"boyish\r\nearnestness,\" the elevation of thought and speech of the old\r\nphilosopher; and in the impression made on the feelings, not the mind,\r\nof the poet, then thirty-five years old.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to ALISON, CAMPBELL reverts with great pleasure to the day\r\nspent with HERSCHEL:\r\n\r\n                                         \"SYDENHAM, _December 12, 1813_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAREST ALISON:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"I spent three weeks with my family at Brighton, in charming\r\n    weather, and was much pleased with, as well as benefited by, the\r\n    place. There I met a man with whom you will stare at the idea of my\r\n    being congenial, or having the vanity to think myself so--the great\r\n    HERSCHEL. He is a simple, great being. . . . I once in my life\r\n    looked at NEWTON'S _Principia_, and attended an astronomical class\r\n    at Glasgow; wonderful it seemed to myself, that the great man\r\n    condescended to understand my questions; to become apparently\r\n    earnest in communicating to me as much information as my limited\r\n    capacity and preparation for such knowledge would admit. He invited\r\n    me to see him at his own abode, and so kindly that I could not\r\n    believe that it was mere good breeding; but a sincere wish to see me\r\n    again. I had a full day with him; he described to me his whole\r\n    interview with BUONAPARTE; said it was not true, as reported, that\r\n    BUONAPARTE understood astronomical subjects deeply, but affected\r\n    more than he knew.\r\n\r\n    \"In speaking of his great and chief telescope, he said with an air,\r\n    not of the least pride, but with a greatness and simplicity of\r\n    expression that struck me with wonder, 'I have looked further into\r\n    space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars, of\r\n    which the light takes _two millions_ of years to travel to this\r\n    globe.' I mean to pay him a reverential visit at Slough, as soon as\r\n    my book is out, this winter.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1807 CAROLINA HERSCHEL has this entry in her diary:\r\n\r\n    \"_October_ 4.--My brother came from Brighton. The same night two\r\n    parties from the Castle came to see the comet, and during the whole\r\n    month my brother had not an evening to himself. As he was then in\r\n    the midst of polishing the forty-foot mirror, rest became absolutely\r\n    necessary after a day spent in that most laborious work; and it has\r\n    ever been my opinion that on the 14th of October his nerves received\r\n    a shock of which he never got the better afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1808 he was quite seriously ill; but in May the\r\nobserving went on again. In 1809 and 1810 his principal investigations\r\nwere upon physical subjects (NEWTON'S rings), and in 1811 the only long\r\nseries of observations was upon the comet of that year. After 1811 the\r\nstate of HERSCHEL'S health required that his observations should be\r\nmuch less frequent. Much of the time after 1811 he was absent, and his\r\nwork at home consisted largely in arranging the results of his previous\r\nlabors, and in computations connected with them. All through the years\r\n1814 to 1822, HERSCHEL'S health was very feeble. The severe winter of\r\n1813-14 had told materially upon him. In 1814, however, he undertook to\r\nrepolish the forty-foot mirror, but was obliged to give it over.\r\n\r\nHe now found it necessary to make frequent little excursions for change\r\nof air and scene. His faithful sister remained at home, bringing order\r\ninto the masses of manuscript, and copying the papers for the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nShe was sick at heart, fearing that each time she saw her brother it\r\nwould be the last. In 1818 she says:\r\n\r\n    \"Feb. 11, I went to my brother and remained with him till the 23d.\r\n    We spent our time, though not in idleness, in sorrow and sadness.\r\n    He is not only unwell, but low in spirits.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1818 (December 16), HERSCHEL went to London to have his portrait\r\npainted by ARTAUD. While he was in London his will was made.[28]\r\n\r\nIn 1819 there is a glimmer of the old-time light. In a note HERSCHEL\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"LINA:--There is a great comet. I want you to assist me. Come to\r\n    dine and spend the day here. If you can come soon after one o'clock,\r\n    we shall have time to prepare maps and telescopes. I saw its\r\n    situation last night. It has a long tail.\r\n\r\n    \"_July 4, 1819._\"\r\n\r\nThis note has been carefully kept by his sister, and on it she has\r\nwritten: \"I keep this as a relic. Every line _now_ traced by the hand of\r\nmy dear brother becomes a treasure to me.\"\r\n\r\nSo the next three years passed away. Sir WILLIAM[29] was daily more and\r\nmore feeble. He spent his time in putting his works in order, but could\r\ndevote only a few moments each day to this. His sister says:\r\n\r\n    \"_Aug. 11th_, _12th_, _13th_, and _14th_ [1822], I went as usual to\r\n    spend some hours of the forenoon with my brother.\r\n\r\n    \"_Aug. 15th._--I hastened to the spot where I was wont to find him,\r\n    with the newspaper which I was to read to him. But instead I found\r\n    Mrs. MONSON, Miss BALDWIN, and Mr. BULMAN, from Leeds, the grandson\r\n    of my brother's earliest acquaintance in this country. I was\r\n    informed my brother had been obliged to return to his room, whither\r\n    I flew immediately. Lady H. and the housekeeper were with him,\r\n    administering everything which could be thought of for supporting\r\n    him. I found him much irritated at not being able to grant Mr.\r\n    BULMAN'S request for some token of remembrance for his father. As\r\n    soon as he saw me, I was sent to the library to fetch one of his\r\n    last papers and a plate of the forty-foot telescope. But for the\r\n    universe I could not have looked twice at what I had snatched from\r\n    the shelf, and when he faintly asked if the breaking up of the Milky\r\n    Way was in it, I said 'Yes,' and he looked content. I cannot help\r\n    remembering this circumstance; it was the last time I was sent to\r\n    the library on such an occasion. That the anxious care for his\r\n    papers and workrooms never ended but with his life, was proved by\r\n    his frequent whispered inquiries if they were locked and the key\r\n    safe, of which I took care to assure him that they were, and the key\r\n    in Lady HERSCHEL'S hands.\r\n\r\n    \"After half an hour's vain attempt to support himself, my brother\r\n    was obliged to consent to be put to bed, leaving no hope ever to see\r\n    him rise again.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of August, 1822, HERSCHEL died peacefully at the age of\r\neighty-four years.\r\n\r\nHis remains lie in the little church at Upton, near Windsor, where a\r\nmemorial tablet has been erected by his son.

The few misconceptions there\r\ncontained will be easily corrected by those to whom alone they are of\r\nconsequence. The latter class of readers may also consult the abstracts\r\nof HERSCHEL'S memoirs, which have been given in \"_A Subject-index and a\r\nSynopsis of the Scientific Writings of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL_,\" prepared\r\nby Dr. HASTINGS and myself, and published by the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\nAn accurate sketch of the state of astronomy in England and on the\r\nContinent, in the years 1780-1820, need not be given. It will be enough\r\nif we remember that of the chief observatories of Europe, public and\r\nprivate, no one was actively devoted to such labors as were undertaken\r\nby HERSCHEL at the very beginning of his career.\r\n\r\nHis observations on variable stars, indeed, were in the same line as\r\nthose of PIGOTT; FLAUGERGUES and DARQUIER, in France, had perhaps\r\npreceded him in minute scrutiny of the sun's surface, etc.; but, even in\r\nthat department of observation, he at once put an immense distance\r\nbetween himself and others by the rapid and extraordinary advances in\r\nthe size and in the excellence of his telescopes. Before his time the\r\nprincipal aids to observation were the Gregorian and Newtonian\r\ntelescopes of SHORT, and the small achromatics of DOLLOND.[31]\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in what goes before, how his patient zeal had succeeded in\r\nimproving upon these. There was no delay, and no rest. Steadily the art\r\nof making reflectors was urged forward, until he had finally in his\r\nhands the forty-foot telescope.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that this was the limit to which the manufacture of\r\npowerful telescopes could be pushed in his generation. The optical and\r\nmechanical difficulties which prevented a farther advance required time\r\nfor their solution; and, indeed, some of these difficulties are scarcely\r\nsolved at this day. It may fairly be said that no reflector larger than\r\nthree feet in aperture has yet realized our expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _The Improvement of Telescopes and Optical Apparatus._\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to give in this place some connected account of\r\nthe large forty-foot reflector, of four feet aperture, made by HERSCHEL.\r\nIts history extends from 1785 to 1811. Its manufacture was considered by\r\nhis cotemporaries as his greatest triumph. As a machine, it was\r\nextremely ingenious in all its parts, as may be seen from the elaborate\r\ndescription and plates of it published in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1795. One of its mirrors certainly had good\r\ndefinition, for, by means of it, the two small satellites of _Saturn_\r\n(_Mimas_ and _Enceladus_) were discovered, and these discoveries alone\r\nwould make it famous. Perhaps more was expected of it by the public in\r\ngeneral than it absolutely performed. Its merits were after a while\r\ndecried, and HERSCHEL even felt obliged to state why he did not always\r\nemploy it in his observations. His reasons were perfectly valid, and\r\nsuch as any one may understand. The time required to get so large a\r\nmachine into working order was a serious tax; it required more\r\nassistants than his twenty-foot telescope, and he says, \"I have made it\r\na rule never to employ a larger telescope when a smaller will answer the\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nIt still remains as a remarkable feat of engineering and an example of\r\ngreat optical and mechanical skill. It led the way to the large\r\nreflectors of Lord ROSSE, some sixty years later, and several of the\r\nforty-foot telescopes of the present day even have done less useful\r\nwork. Its great feat, however, was to have added two satellites to the\r\nsolar system. From the published accounts of it the following is taken:\r\n\r\n    \"When I resided at Bath I had long been acquainted with the theory\r\n    of optics and mechanics, and wanted only that experience so\r\n    necessary in the practical part of these sciences. This I acquired\r\n    by degrees at that place, where in my leisure hours, by way of\r\n    amusement, I made several two-foot, five-foot, seven-foot, ten-foot,\r\n    and twenty-foot Newtonian telescopes, beside others, of the\r\n    Gregorian form, of eight, twelve, and eighteen inches, and two,\r\n    three, five, and ten feet focal length. In this way I made not less\r\n    than two hundred seven-foot, one hundred and fifty ten-foot, and\r\n    about eighty twenty-foot mirrors, not to mention the Gregorian\r\n    telescopes.[32]\r\n\r\n    \"The number of stands I invented for these telescopes it would not\r\n    be easy to assign. . . . In 1781 I began to construct a thirty-foot\r\n    aërial reflector, and having made a stand for it, I cast the mirror\r\n    thirty-six inches in diameter. This was cracked in cooling. I cast\r\n    it a second time, and the furnace I had built in my house broke.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after, the Georgian planet was discovered, and this interrupted the\r\nwork for a time.\r\n\r\n    \"In the year 1783 I finished a very good twenty-foot reflector with\r\n    a large aperture, and mounted it upon the plan of my present\r\n    telescope. After two years' observation with it, the great advantage\r\n    of such apertures appeared so clearly to me that I recurred to my\r\n    former intention of increasing them still further; and being now\r\n    sufficiently provided with experience in the work which I wished to\r\n    undertake, the President of the Royal Society, who is always ready\r\n    to promote useful undertakings, had the goodness to lay my design\r\n    before the king. His Majesty was graciously pleased to approve of\r\n    it, and with his usual liberality to support it with his royal\r\n    bounty.\r\n\r\n    \"In consequence of this arrangement I began to construct the\r\n    forty-foot telescope about the latter end of 1785.[33] The woodwork\r\n    of the stand and machines for giving the required motions to the\r\n    instrument were immediately put in hand. In the whole of the\r\n    apparatus none but common workmen were employed, for I made drawings\r\n    of every part of it, by which it was easy to execute the work, as I\r\n    constantly inspected and directed every person's labor; though\r\n    sometimes there were not less than forty different workmen employed\r\n    at the same time. While the stand of the telescope was preparing, I\r\n    also began the construction of the great mirror, of which I\r\n    inspected the casting, grinding, and polishing, and the work was in\r\n    this manner carried on with no other interruption than that\r\n    occasioned by the removal of all the apparatus and materials from\r\n    where I then lived, to my present situation at Slough.\r\n\r\n    \"Here, soon after my arrival, I began to lay the foundation upon\r\n    which by degrees the whole structure was raised as it now stands,\r\n    and the speculum being highly polished and put into the tube, I had\r\n    the first view through it on February 19, 1787. I do not, however,\r\n    date the completing of the instrument till much later. For the first\r\n    speculum, by a mismanagement of the person who cast it, came out\r\n    thinner on the centre of the back than was intended, and on account\r\n    of its weakness would not permit a good figure to be given to it.\r\n\r\n    \"A second mirror was cast January 26, 1788, but it cracked in\r\n    cooling. February 16 we recast it, and it proved to be of a proper\r\n    degree of strength. October 24 it was brought to a pretty good\r\n    figure and polish, and I observed the planet _Saturn_ with it. But\r\n    not being satisfied, I continued to work upon it till August 27,\r\n    1789, when it was tried upon the fixed stars, and I found it to give\r\n    a pretty sharp image. Large stars were a little affected with\r\n    scattered light, owing to many remaining scratches on the mirror.\r\n    August the 28th, 1789, having brought the telescope to the parallel\r\n    of _Saturn_, I discovered a _sixth_ satellite of that planet, and\r\n    also saw the spots upon _Saturn_ better than I had ever seen them\r\n    before, so that I may date the finishing of the forty-foot telescope\r\n    from that time.\"\r\n\r\nAnother satellite of _Saturn_ was discovered with the forty-foot on the\r\n17th of September (1789). It was used for various observations so late\r\nas 1811. On January 19, of that year, HERSCHEL observed the nebula of\r\n_Orion_ with it. This was one of his last observations.\r\n\r\nThe final disposition of the telescope is told in the following extract\r\nfrom a letter of Sir JOHN HERSCHEL'S to Mr. WELD, Secretary of the Royal\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\n                                       \"COLLINGWOOD, _March 13, 1847_.\r\n\r\n    . . . \"In reply to your queries, respecting the forty-foot\r\n    reflecting telescope constructed by my father, I have to state that\r\n    King GEORGE III. munificently defrayed the _entire_ cost of that\r\n    instrument (including, of course, all preparatory cost in the nature\r\n    of construction of tools, and of the apparatus for casting, grinding,\r\n    and figuring the reflectors, of which two were constructed), at a\r\n    total cost of £4,000. The woodwork of the telescope being so far\r\n    decayed as to be dangerous, in the year 1839 I pulled it down, and\r\n    piers were erected on which the tube was placed, _that_ being of\r\n    iron and so well preserved, that, although not more than\r\n    one-twentieth of an inch thick, when in the horizontal position it\r\n    sustained within it all my family, and continues to sustain inclosed\r\n    within it, to this day, not only the heavier of the two reflectors,\r\n    but also all the more important portions of the machinery. . . .\r\n    The mirror and the rest of the polishing apparatus are on the\r\n    premises. The iron grinding tools and polishers are placed\r\n    underneath the tube, let into the ground, and level with the surface\r\n    of the gravelled area in which it stands.\". . .\r\n\r\nThe closing of the tube was done with appropriate ceremony on\r\nNew-Year's-Day, 1840, when, after a procession through it by the family\r\nat Slough, a poem, written by Sir JOHN, was read, the machinery put into\r\nits present position, and the tube sealed.\r\n\r\nThe memoir on the forty-foot telescope shows throughout that HERSCHEL'S\r\nprime object was not the making of the telescope itself, but that his\r\nmind was constantly directed towards the uses to which it was to be\r\nput--towards the questions which he wished it to answer.\r\n\r\nAgain and again, in his various papers, he returns to the question of\r\nthe _limit of vision_. As BESSEL has said:\r\n\r\n    \"The naked eye has its limit of vision in the stars of the sixth\r\n    magnitude. The light of fainter stars than these does not affect the\r\n    retina enough for them to be seen. A very small telescope penetrates\r\n    to smaller, and, in general, without doubt, to more distant stars.\r\n    A more powerful one penetrates deeper into space, and as its power is\r\n    increased, so the boundaries of the visible universe are widened,\r\n    and the number of stars increased to millions and millions. Whoever\r\n    has followed the history of the series of HERSCHEL'S telescopes will\r\n    have observed this. But HERSCHEL was not content with the bare fact,\r\n    but strove ever to know _how far_ a telescope of a certain\r\n    construction and size could penetrate, compared with the naked and\r\n    unassisted eye. These investigations were never for the discovery of\r\n    new facts concerning the working of his instruments; it was for the\r\n    knowledge of the distribution of the fixed stars in space itself\r\n    that he strove. . . . HERSCHEL'S instruments were designed to aid\r\n    vision to the last extent. They were only secondarily for the taking\r\n    of measures. His efforts were not for a knowledge of the _motions_,\r\n    but of the _constitution_ and _construction_ of the heavenly\r\n    bodies.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the stands for his telescopes, which were both ingenious and\r\nconvenient, HERSCHEL devised many forms of apparatus for facilitating\r\nthe art of observation. His micrometers for measuring position angles,\r\nhis lamp micrometer, the method of limiting apertures, and the methods\r\nhe used for viewing the sun may be mentioned among these.\r\n\r\nPoints in practical astronomy are considered all through the years of\r\nobservation. A reference to his original papers will show how numerous,\r\nhow varied, and how valuable these are. I cannot forbear quoting here\r\nthe account of a precaution observed during his examination of the belts\r\non _Saturn_ (1794).\r\n\r\nIt is the most striking example of how fully HERSCHEL realized that the\r\neye of the observer is a material part of the optical apparatus of\r\nastronomy. Simple as this principle may appear, it was an absolute\r\nnovelty in his day.\r\n\r\nIn making these observations, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"I took care to bend my head so as to receive the picture of the\r\n    belt in the same direction as I did formerly. This was a precaution\r\n    that occurred to me, as there was a possibility that the vertical\r\n    diameter of the retina might be more or less sensitive than the\r\n    horizontal one.\"\r\n\r\nAstronomers will recognize in this the first suggestion of the processes\r\nwhich have led to important results in the hands of Dr. OTTO STRUVE and\r\nothers in the comparison of the measures of double stars by different\r\nobservers, each of whom has a personal habit of observation, which, if\r\nnot corrected, may affect his results in the way which HERSCHEL was\r\nstriving to avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Researches on the Relative Brightness of the\r\n                     Stars: Variable Stars._\r\n\r\nNo research of HERSCHEL'S was more laborious than the elaborate\r\nclassification of the stars according to their comparative brightness,\r\nwhich he executed during the years 1796 to 1799. It was directly in the\r\nline of his main work--to find out the construction of the heavens.\r\n\r\nHis first paper had been upon the variable star _Mira Ceti_. Here was a\r\nsun, shining by its native brightness, which waxed and waned like the\r\nmoon itself. This star is periodic. It is for a long period invisible to\r\nthe unassisted eye. Then it can just be seen, and increases in\r\nbrightness for a little over a month, and attains a maximum brilliancy.\r\nFrom this it decreases for nearly three months, and after becoming\r\ninvisible, remains so for five or six months. Its whole period is about\r\n333 days. Are all other stars constant in brightness? The example of\r\n_Mira Ceti_ and of other known variables makes this at least doubtful.\r\nBut the sun itself may vary for all that we know. It is a simple star\r\nlike the rest.\r\n\r\nThis question of variability in general is an important one, then.\r\nIt can only be tested by making accurate catalogues of the relative\r\nbrilliance of stars at various times, and by comparing these. No such\r\ngeneral catalogue existed before HERSCHEL'S time, and led by the\r\ndiscrepancies in isolated cases, which he found between his own\r\nestimates and those of his predecessors, he made from observation a\r\nseries of four catalogues, in which were set down the order of sequence\r\nof the stars of each constellation.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted by HERSCHEL was perfectly simple in principle, though\r\nmost laborious in practice. Suppose any number of stars, A, B, C, D, E,\r\n. . . etc., near enough to each other to be well compared. The process\r\nconsists simply in writing down the names of the stars, A, B, C, etc.,\r\nin the order of their relative brightness. Thus if for a group of eight\r\nstars we have found at one epoch A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and if at\r\nanother time the order was A, B, C, D, F, E, G, H, symptoms of\r\nvariability are pointed out. Repeated observations, where the same star\r\nis found in different sequences, will decide the question. Thus, for the\r\nstars visible to the naked eye, we know exactly the state of the sky in\r\nHERSCHEL'S day, now nearly a century ago. Any material change cannot\r\nescape us. These catalogues have been singularly overlooked by the\r\nobservers of our generation who have followed this branch of\r\nobservation, and it was not till 1876 that they received proper\r\nattention and a suitable reduction (at the hands of Mr. C. S. PIERCE).\r\n\r\nWe owe to HERSCHEL the first trustworthy account of the stars visible\r\nto the naked eye, and since the date of his labors (about 1800) we have\r\nsimilar views published by ARGELANDER (1839), HEIS (1848), ARGELANDER\r\nand SCHÖNFELD (1857), GOULD (1860 and 1872), and HOUZEAU (1875). Thus\r\nhis labors have been well followed up.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of this work HERSCHEL found stars whose light was\r\nprogressively diminishing, others which regularly increased, one star\r\nwhose light periodically varies (_[alpha] Herculis_), and at least\r\none star (55 _Herculis_) which has utterly disappeared. On October 10,\r\n1781, and April 11, 1782, he observed this latter star, but in May,\r\n1791, it had totally vanished. There was no trace remaining.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the variability of _[alpha] Herculis_ was a more\r\nimportant one than would at first sight appear. Up to that time the only\r\nvariable stars known were seven in number. Their periods were four\r\nhundred and ninety-four, four hundred and four, three hundred and\r\nthirty-four, seven, six, five, and three days. These periods seemed to\r\nfall into two groups, one of from three hundred to five hundred days,\r\nthe other comparatively much shorter, of three to seven days.\r\n_[alpha] Herculis_ came to occupy the middle place between these groups,\r\nits period being about sixty days.\r\n\r\nThe cause of these strange and regular variations of brightness was\r\nsupposed by HERSCHEL to be the rotation of the star bodily on an axis,\r\nby which revolution different parts of its surface, of different\r\nbrilliancy, were successively and periodically presented to us. This\r\nexplanation it might have been difficult to receive, when the periods of\r\nthe known variables were so markedly various in length. His own\r\ndiscovery came to bridge over the interval, and quite confirmed him in\r\nhis belief. He returned to the subject of the revolution of stars about\r\ntheir axes again and again, and connected it with the revolution of\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\nHe found that the satellites of _Jupiter_ and one of _Saturn's_\r\nperiodically changed in brightness, and by quite simple means showed\r\nthat their periods of rotation were at least approximately the same as\r\ntheir periods of revolution about their primaries. In this case, as in\r\nevery other, he considered a discovery in each and every one of its\r\npossible bearings. There are no instances where he has singularly\r\noverlooked the consequences of his observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Researches on Double Stars._\r\n\r\nThe double stars were the subject of HERSCHEL'S earliest and of his\r\nlatest papers. In 1782 he published his \"_Catalogue of Double Stars_,\"\r\nand his last published memoir (1822) was on the same subject.\r\n\r\nThe question of determining the parallax of stars first brought HERSCHEL\r\nto the discovery of double stars. If two stars, A and B, appear very\r\nclose together, and if, in reality, the star B is very many times more\r\ndistant from the earth than A, although seen along the same line of\r\nsight, then the revolution of the earth in its orbit will produce\r\nchanges in the relative situation of A and B, and, in fact, B will\r\ndescribe a small orbit about A, due to this revolution. This idea had\r\nbeen proposed by GALILEO, and measures on this plan had been made by\r\nLONG, with negative results. But HERSCHEL, in reviewing their work,\r\ndeclares that the stars chosen by LONG were not suitable to the purpose.\r\nIt is necessary, among other things, to the success of this method, that\r\nit should be certain that the star B is really very much more distant\r\nthan the star A. The only general test of the distance of stars is their\r\nbrilliancy, and HERSCHEL decided to use only stars for this research\r\nwhich had two components very greatly different in brightness. A must be\r\nvery bright (and presumably near to us), and B must be very close to A,\r\nand very faint (and thus, presumably, very distant).\r\n\r\nIt was in the search for such pairs of stars that the _Catalogue of\r\nDouble Stars_ (1782) was formed. HERSCHEL'S first idea of a double star\r\nmade such pairs as he found, to consist of two stars _accidentally_ near\r\nto each other. A was near to us, and appeared projected in a certain\r\nplace on the celestial sphere. B was many times more distant, but, by\r\nchance, was seen along the same line, and made with A an _optical_\r\ndouble. If the two stars were at the same distance from the earth, if\r\nthey made part of the same physical system, if one revolved around the\r\nother, then this method of gaining a knowledge of their distance failed.\r\nEven in his first memoir on the subject, a surmise that this latter\r\nstate might occur in some cases, was expressed by HERSCHEL. The notes on\r\nsome of the pairs declare that a motion of one of them was suspected.\r\nBut this motion might be truly orbital--of one star about the other as\r\na centre--or it might simply be that one star was moving by its own\r\n_proper_ motion, and leaving the other behind. It was best to wait and\r\nsee. The first Catalogue of Double Stars contained two hundred and three\r\ninstances of such associations. These were observed from time to time,\r\nand new pairs discovered. The paper of MICHELL, \"An Inquiry into the\r\nprobable Parallax and Magnitude of the Fixed Stars, from the Quantity of\r\nLight which they Afford, and the Particular Circumstances of their\r\nSituation\" (1767), was read and pondered. By 1802 HERSCHEL had become\r\ncertain that there existed in the heavens real pairs of stars, both at\r\nthe same distance from the earth, which were physically connected with\r\neach other. The arguments of MICHELL have been applied by BESSEL to the\r\ncase of one of HERSCHEL'S double stars, in much the same order in which\r\nthe argument ran in HERSCHEL'S own mind, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe star _Castor_ (_[alpha] Geminorum_) is a double star, where A is of\r\nthe second, and B of the fourth, magnitude. To the naked eye these two\r\nappear as one star. With a telescope this is seen to be two stars, some\r\n5\" apart. In the whole sky there are not above fifty such stars\r\nas the brighter of the two, and about four hundred of the brilliancy of\r\nB. These fifty and four hundred stars are scattered over the vault of\r\nheaven, almost at random. No law has yet been traced by which we can say\r\nthat here or here there shall be a bright star like A, or a fainter one\r\nlike B. In general the distribution appears to be fortuitous. How then\r\ncan we account for one of the four hundred stars like B placed so close\r\nto one of the fifty like A?\r\n\r\nThe chances are over four hundred thousand to one that the association\r\nin position is not accidental. This argument becomes overwhelming when\r\nthe same association is found in many other cases. There were two\r\nhundred and three doubles in the Catalogue of 1782 alone, and many\r\nthousands are now known.\r\n\r\nBy a process like this, HERSCHEL reached his grand discovery of true\r\nbinary systems, where one sun revolves about another. For he saw that\r\nif the two stars are near together in space, they could not stand still\r\nin face of each other, but that they must revolve in true orbits. Here\r\nwas the discovery which came to take the place of the detection of the\r\nparallaxes of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nHe had failed in one research, but he was led to grand conclusions.\r\nWas the force that these distant pairs of suns obeyed, the force of\r\ngravitation? This he could not settle, but his successors have done so.\r\nIt was not till about 1827 that SAVARY, of the Paris Observatory, showed\r\nthat one of HERSCHEL'S doubles was subjected to the law of gravitation,\r\nand thus extended the power of this law from our system to the universe\r\nat large. HERSCHEL himself lived to see some of his double stars perform\r\nhalf a revolution.\r\n\r\nOf HERSCHEL'S discoveries, ARAGO thinks this has \"le plus d'avenir.\"\r\nIt may well be so. The laws which govern our solar system have been\r\nextended, through his researches, to regions of unknown distance. The\r\nbinary stars will afford the largest field for research into the laws\r\nwhich govern them, and together with the clusters and groups, they will\r\ngive a firm basis by which to study the distribution of stars in\r\ngeneral, since here we have the great advantage of knowing, if not the\r\nreal distance of the two stars from the earth, at least that this\r\ndistance is alike for both.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Researches on Planets and Satellites._\r\n\r\nAfter HERSCHEL'S first publication on the mountains of the Moon (1780),\r\nour satellite appears to have occupied him but little. The observation\r\nof volcanoes (1787) and of a lunar eclipse are his only published ones.\r\nThe planets _Mercury_, _Venus_, _Mars_, and _Jupiter_, although they\r\nwere often studied, were not the subjects of his more important memoirs.\r\nThe planet _Saturn_, on the contrary, seems never to have been lost\r\nsight of from the time of his first view of it in 1772.\r\n\r\nThe field of discovery always appears to be completely occupied until\r\nthe advent of a great man, who, even by his way of putting old and\r\nfamiliar facts, shows the paths along which discoveries must come, if at\r\nall. This faculty comes from profound reflection on the nature of the\r\nsubject itself, from a sort of transmuting power which changes the words\r\nof the books into the things of reality. HERSCHEL'S paper on _Saturn_,\r\nin 1790, is an admirable example of this.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL'S observations on _Saturn_ began in 1772. From 1790 to 1808 he\r\npublished six memoirs on the figure, the ring, and the satellites of\r\nthis planet. The spheroidal shape of the ball was first discovered by\r\nhim, and we owe much of our certain knowledge of the constitution of the\r\nrings to his work. The sixth and seventh satellites, _Mimas_ and\r\n_Enceladus_, were discovered by him in 1789. The periods of rotation of\r\nthe ball and of the ring were also fixed. In his conclusions as to the\r\nreal figure of the rings, there is a degree of scientific caution which\r\nis truly remarkable, and which to-day seems almost excessive.\r\n\r\nIn his paper of 1792, HERSCHEL shows that the most distant satellite of\r\n_Saturn_--_Japetus_--turns once on its axis in each revolution about its\r\nprimary, just as our moon does. He says of this:\r\n\r\n    \"I cannot help reflecting with some pleasure on the discovery of an\r\n    analogy which shows that a certain uniform plan is carried on among\r\n    the secondary planets of our solar system; and we may conjecture\r\n    that probably most of the satellites are governed by the same law;\r\n    especially if it be founded on such a construction of their figure\r\n    as makes them more ponderous towards their primary planets.\"\r\n\r\nI believe the last suggestion to have been the first statement of the\r\npossible arrangement of matter in satellites, which was afterwards so\r\nforcibly maintained by HANSEN in his theory of the moon. HANSEN'S\r\nresearches show the consequences of such an arrangement, although they\r\ndo not prove its existence.\r\n\r\nIt should be recorded that the explanation which is to-day received of\r\nthe belts and bands upon _Jupiter_, is, I believe, first found in\r\nHERSCHEL'S memoir on _Venus_ (1793). His memoir of 1797, on the\r\nchangeable brightness of the satellites of _Jupiter_, has already been\r\nreferred to. The times of the rotation of the satellites on their axes\r\nwas first determined by HERSCHEL from these observations, which also\r\ncontain accounts of the curious, and as yet unexplained, phenomena\r\nattending their appearances on the disc of the planet.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL discovered in January, 1787, the two brighter satellites of\r\n_Uranus_, now called _Oberon_ and _Titania_. They are among the faintest\r\nobjects in the solar system. A later discussion of all his observations\r\nled him to the belief that there were four more, and he gives his\r\nobservations and computations in full. He says that of the existence of\r\nadditional satellites he has no doubt. Of these four, three were\r\nexterior to the most distant satellite _Oberon_, the other was\r\n\"interior\" to _Titania_.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1834 that even _Oberon_ and _Titania_ were again\r\nobserved (by Sir JOHN HERSCHEL) with a telescope of twenty feet, similar\r\nto that which had discovered them, and not until 1847 was the true state\r\nof this system known, when Mr. LASSELL discovered _Ariel_ and _Umbriel_,\r\ntwo satellites interior to _Titania_, neither of which was HERSCHEL'S\r\n\"interior\" satellite. In 1848 and later years Mr. LASSELL, by the aid of\r\ntelescopes constructed by himself, fully settled the fact that only\r\nfour satellites of this planet existed. In 1874 I examined the\r\nobservations of HERSCHEL on his supposed \"interior\" satellite, thinking\r\nthat it might be possible that among the very few glimpses of it which\r\nhe recorded, some might have belonged to _Ariel_ and some to _Umbriel_,\r\nand that by combining rare and almost accidental observations of two\r\nsatellites which really existed, he had come to announce the existence\r\nof an \"interior\" satellite which had no existence in fact. Such I\r\nbelieve to be the case. In 1801, April 17, HERSCHEL describes an\r\ninterior satellite in the position angle 189°, distant 18\" from\r\nthe planet. At that instant _Umbriel_, one of Mr. LASSELL'S satellites,\r\nwas in the position 191°, and distant 21\" from _Uranus_, in the\r\nmost favorable position for seeing it. The observation of 1794, March\r\n27, _may_ belong to _Ariel_. At the best the investigation is of passing\r\ninterest only, and has nothing to do with the question of the discovery\r\nof the satellites. HERSCHEL discovered the two brighter ones, and it\r\nwas only sixty years later that they were properly re-observed by Mr.\r\nLASSELL, who has the great honor of having added as many more, and who\r\nfirst settled the vexed question of satellites _exterior_ to _Oberon_,\r\nand this with a reflecting telescope made by himself, which is\r\nunequalled by any other of its dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Researches on the Nature of the Sun._\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to his paper on the _Nature and Construction of the\r\nSun and Fixed Stars_ (1795), HERSCHEL recounts what was known of the\r\nnature of the sun at that time. NEWTON had shown that it was the centre\r\nof the system; GALILEO and his successors had determined its rotation,\r\nthe place of its equator, its real diameter, magnitude, density,\r\ndistance, and the force of gravity on its surface. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"I should not wonder if, considering all this, we were induced to\r\n    think that nothing remained to be added; and yet we are still very\r\n    ignorant in regard to the internal construction of the sun.\" \"The\r\n    spots have been supposed to be solid bodies, the smoke of\r\n    volcanoes, the scum floating on an ocean of fluid matter, clouds,\r\n    opaque masses, and to be many other things.\" \"The sun itself has\r\n    been called a globe of fire, though, perhaps, metaphorically.\" \"It\r\n    is time now to profit by the observations we are in possession of.\r\n    I have availed myself of the labors of preceding astronomers, but\r\n    have been induced thereto by my own actual observation of the solar\r\n    phenomena.\"\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL then refers to the theories advanced by his friend, Prof.\r\nWILSON, of Glasgow, in 1774. WILSON maintained that the spots were\r\ndepressions below the sun's atmosphere, vast hollows as it were, at the\r\nbases of which the true surface of the sun could be seen.\r\n\r\nThe essence of his theory was the existence of two different kinds of\r\nmatter in the sun: one solid and non-luminous--the nucleus--the other\r\ngaseous and incandescent--the atmosphere. Vacant places in the\r\natmosphere, however caused, would show the black surface of the solid\r\nmass below. These were the spots. No explanation could be given of the\r\n_faculæ_, bright streaks, which appear on the sun's surface from time\r\nto time; but his theory accounted for the existence of the black\r\n_nuclei_ of the spots, and for the existence of the _penumbræ_ about\r\nthese. The penumbra of a spot was formed by the thinner parts of the\r\natmosphere about the vacancy which surrounded the nucleus.\r\n\r\nThis theory of WILSON'S was adopted by HERSCHEL as a basis for his own,\r\nand he brought numerous observations to confirm it, in the modified\r\nshape which he gave to it.\r\n\r\nAccording to HERSCHEL, the sun consisted of three essentially different\r\nparts. First, there was a solid nucleus, non-luminous, cool, and even\r\ncapable of being inhabited. Second, above this was an atmosphere proper;\r\nand, lastly, outside of this was a layer in which floated the clouds, or\r\nbodies which gave to the solar surface its intense brilliancy:\r\n\r\n    \"According to my theory, a dark spot in the sun is a place in its\r\n    atmosphere which happens to be free from luminous decompositions\"\r\n    above it.\r\n\r\nThe two atmospheric layers, which will be of varying thickness about a\r\nspot, will account for all the shades of darkness seen in the penumbra.\r\nAscending currents from the solar surface will elevate certain regions,\r\nand may increase the solar activity near by, and will thus give rise to\r\nfaculæ, which HERSCHEL shows to be elevated above the general surface.\r\nIt will not be necessary to give a further account of this theory. The\r\ndata in the possession of the modern theorist is a thousand-fold that to\r\nbe derived from HERSCHEL'S observations, and, while the subject of the\r\ninternal construction of the sun is to-day unsettled, we know that many\r\nimportant, even fundamental, portions of his theory are untenable.\r\nA remark of his should be recorded, however, as it has played a great\r\npart in such theories:\r\n\r\n    \"That the emission of light must waste the sun, is not a difficulty\r\n    that can be opposed to our hypothesis. Many of the operations of\r\n    Nature are carried on in her great laboratory which we cannot\r\n    comprehend. Perhaps the many telescopic comets may restore to the\r\n    sun what is lost by the emission of light.\"\r\n\r\nArguments in favor of the habitability of both sun and moon are\r\ncontained in this paper; but they rest more on a metaphysical than a\r\nscientific basis, and are to-day justly forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Researches on the Motion of the Sun and of\r\n                    the Solar System in Space._\r\n\r\nIn 1782 HERSCHEL writes, in regard to some of his discoveries of double\r\nstars:\r\n\r\n    \"These may serve another very important end. I will just mention it,\r\n    though it is foreign to my present purpose. Several stars of the\r\n    first magnitude have been observed or suspected to have a proper\r\n    motion; hence we may surmise that our sun, with all its planets and\r\n    comets, may also have a motion towards some particular point of the\r\n    heavens. . . . If this surmise should have any foundation, it will show\r\n    itself in a series of some years in a kind of systematical parallax,\r\n    or change, due to the motion of the whole solar system.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1783 he published his paper _On the Proper Motion of the Solar\r\nSystem_, which contained the proofs of his surmises of a year before.\r\nThat certain of the stars had in fact a _proper_ motion had been well\r\nestablished by the astronomers of the eighteenth century. After all\r\nallowances had been made for the effects of precession and other\r\ndisplacements of a star's position which were produced by motions of the\r\nearth, it was found that there were still small outstanding differences\r\nwhich must be due to the motion of the star itself--its proper motion.\r\nThe quantity of this motion was not well known for any star when\r\nHERSCHEL'S researches began. Before they were concluded, however,\r\nMASKELYNE had deduced the proper motions of thirty-six stars--the\r\nfundamental stars, so called--which included in their number _Sirius_,\r\n_Procyon_, _Arcturus_, and generally the brightest stars.\r\n\r\nIt is _à priori_ evident that stars, in general, must have proper\r\nmotions, when once we admit the universality of gravitation. That any\r\nfixed star should be entirely at rest would require that the attractions\r\non all sides of it should be exactly balanced. Any change in the\r\nposition of this star would break up this balance, and thus, in general,\r\nit follows that stars must be in motion, since all of them cannot occupy\r\nsuch a critical position as has to be assumed. If but one fixed star is\r\nin motion, this affects all the rest, and we cannot doubt but that\r\nevery star, our sun included, is in motion by an amount which varies\r\nfrom small to great. If the sun alone had a motion, and the other stars\r\nwere at rest, the consequence of this would be that all the fixed stars\r\nwould appear to be retreating _en masse_ from that point in the sky\r\ntowards which we were moving. Those nearest us would move more rapidly,\r\nthose more distant less so. And in the same way, the stars from which\r\nthe solar system was receding would seem to be approaching each other.\r\nIf the stars, instead of being quite at rest, as just supposed, had\r\nmotions proper to themselves, then we should have a double complexity.\r\nThey would still appear to an observer in the solar system to have\r\nmotions, and part of these motions would be truly proper to the stars,\r\nand part would be due to the advance of the sun itself in space.\r\n\r\nObservations can show us only the _resultant_ of these two motions.\r\nIt is for reasoning to separate this resultant into its two components.\r\nAt first the question is to determine whether the results of observation\r\nindicate any solar motion at all. If there is none, the proper motions\r\nof stars will be directed along all possible lines. If the sun does\r\ntruly move, then there will be a general agreement in the resultant\r\nmotions of the stars near the ends of the line along which it moves,\r\nwhile those at the sides, so to speak, will show comparatively less\r\nsystematic effect. It is as if one were riding in the rear of a railway\r\ntrain and watching the rails over which it has just passed. As we recede\r\nfrom any point, the rails at that point seem to come nearer and nearer\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIf we were passing through a forest, we should see the trunks of the\r\ntrees from which we were going apparently come nearer and nearer\r\ntogether, while those on the sides of us would remain at their constant\r\ndistance, and those in front would grow further and further apart.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena, which occur in a case where we are sensible of our own\r\nmotion, serve to show how we may deduce a motion, otherwise unknown,\r\nfrom the appearances which are presented by the stars in space.\r\n\r\nIn this way, acting upon suggestions which had been thrown out\r\npreviously to his own time by LAMBERT, MAYER, and BRADLEY, HERSCHEL\r\ndemonstrated that the sun, together with all its system, was moving\r\nthrough space in an unknown and majestic orbit of its own. The centre\r\nround which this motion is directed cannot yet be assigned. We can\r\nonly know the point in the heavens towards which our course is\r\ndirected--\"the apex of solar motion.\"\r\n\r\nBy a study of the proper motions assigned by MASKELYNE to the brighter\r\nstars, HERSCHEL was able to define the position of the solar apex with\r\nan astonishing degree of accuracy. His calculations have been several\r\ntimes repeated with the advantage of modern analytical methods, and of\r\nthe hundred-fold material now at our disposition, but nothing essential\r\nhas been added to his results of 1805, which were based upon such scanty\r\ndata; and his paper of 1782 contains the announcement of the discovery\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nHis second paper on the _Direction_ and _Velocity_ of the solar system\r\n(1805) is the best example that can possibly be given of his marvellous\r\nskill in reaching the heart of a matter, and it may be the one in which\r\nhis philosophical powers appear in their highest exercise. For sustained\r\nreflection and high philosophic thought it is to be ranked with the\r\nresearches of NEWTON in the _Principia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Researches on the Construction of the Heavens._\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL'S papers on the Construction of the Heavens, as he named it,\r\nextended over his whole scientific life. By this he specially means the\r\nmethod according to which the stars, the clusters, the nebulæ, are\r\nspread through the regions of space, the causes that have led to this\r\ndistribution, and the laws to which it is subjected.\r\n\r\nNo single astronomical fact is unimportant in the light which it may\r\nthrow on the scheme of the whole, and each fact is to be considered in\r\nthis light. As an instance: his discovery of the variable star\r\n_[alpha] Herculis_, which has a period of sixty days, was valuable in\r\nitself as adding one more to the number of those strange suns whose\r\nlight is now brighter, now fainter, in a regular and periodic order.\r\nBut the chief value of the discovery was that now we had an instance of\r\na periodic star which went through all its phases in sixty days, and\r\nconnected, as it were, the stars of short periods (three to seven days)\r\nwith those of very long ones (three hundred to five hundred days), which\r\ntwo groups had, until then, been the only ones known. In the same way\r\nall his researches on the parallaxes of stars were not alone for the\r\ndiscovery of the distance of any one or two single stars, but to gain a\r\nunit of celestial measure, by means of which the depths of space might\r\nbe sounded.\r\n\r\nAstronomy in HERSCHEL'S day considered the bodies of the solar system as\r\nseparated from each other by distances, and as filling a cubical space.\r\nThe ideas of near and far, of up and down, were preserved, in regard to\r\nthem, by common astronomical terms. But the vast number of stars seemed\r\nto be thought of, as they appear in fact to exist, lying on the surface\r\nof a hollow sphere. The immediate followers of BRADLEY used these fixed\r\nstars as points of reference by which the motions within the solar\r\nsystem could be determined, or, like LACAILLE and LALANDE, gathered\r\nthose immense catalogues of their positions which are so indispensable\r\nto the science. MICHELL and HERSCHEL alone, in England, occupied their\r\nthoughts with the nature and construction of the heavens--the one in his\r\nstudy, the other through observation.[34] They were concerned with all\r\nthree of the dimensions of space.\r\n\r\nIn his memoir of 1784, HERSCHEL says:\r\n\r\n    \"Hitherto the sidereal heavens have, not inadequately for the\r\n    purpose designed, been represented by the concave surface of a\r\n    sphere, in the centre of which the eye of an observer might be\r\n    supposed to be placed.\r\n\r\n    \"It is true the various magnitudes of the fixed stars even then\r\n    plainly suggested to us, and would have better suited, the idea of\r\n    an expanded firmament of three dimensions; but the observations upon\r\n    which I am now going to enter still farther illustrate and enforce\r\n    the necessity of considering the heavens in this point of view. In\r\n    future, therefore, we shall look upon those regions into which we\r\n    may now penetrate by means of such large telescopes, as a naturalist\r\n    regards a rich extent of ground or chain of mountains containing\r\n    strata variously inclined and directed, as well as consisting of\r\n    very different materials. The surface of a globe or map, therefore,\r\n    will but ill delineate the interior parts of the heavens.\"\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL'S method of study was founded on a mode of observation which he\r\ncalled _star-gauging_. It consisted in pointing a powerful telescope\r\ntoward various parts of the heavens, and ascertaining by actual count\r\nhow thick the stars were in each region. His twenty-foot reflector was\r\nprovided with such an eye-piece that, in looking into it, he saw a\r\nportion of the heavens about 15' in diameter. A circle of this size on\r\nthe celestial sphere has about one quarter the apparent surface of the\r\nsun, or of the full moon. On pointing the telescope in any direction, a\r\ngreater or less number of stars were visible. These were counted, and\r\nthe direction in which the telescope pointed was noted. Gauges of this\r\nkind were made in all parts of the sky, and the results were tabulated\r\nin the order of right ascension.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from the gauges, and gives the average\r\nnumber of stars in each field at the points noted in right ascension and\r\nnorth polar distance:\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n              |    N.

Such differences are still\r\nmore marked, if we compare the extreme cases found by HERSCHEL, as\r\nR. A. = 19h 41m, N. P. D. = 74° 33', number of stars per field = 588;\r\nand R. A. = 16h 10m, N. P. D. = 113° 4', number of stars = 1.1.\r\n\r\nThe number of stars in certain portions is very great. For example, in\r\nthe Milky Way, near _Orion_, six fields of view promiscuously taken gave\r\n110, 60, 70, 90, 70, and 74 stars each, or a mean of 79 stars per field.\r\nThe most vacant space in this neighborhood gave 60 stars. So that as\r\nHERSCHEL'S sweeps were two degrees wide in declination, in one hour\r\n(15°) there would pass through the field of his telescope 40,000 or more\r\nstars. In some of the sweeps this number was as great as 116,000 stars\r\nin a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nWhen HERSCHEL first applied his telescope to the Milky Way, he believed\r\nthat it completely resolved the whole whitish appearance into small\r\nstars. This conclusion he subsequently modified. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"It is very probable that the great stratum called the Milky Way is\r\n    that in which the sun is placed, though perhaps not in the very\r\n    centre of its thickness.\r\n\r\n    \"We gather this from the appearance of the Galaxy, which seems to\r\n    encompass the whole heavens, as it certainly must do if the sun is\r\n    within it. For, suppose a number of stars arranged between two\r\n    parallel planes, indefinitely extended every way, but at a given\r\n    considerable distance from each other; and calling this a sidereal\r\n    stratum, an eye placed somewhere within it will see all the stars in\r\n    the direction of the planes of the stratum projected into a great\r\n    circle, which will appear lucid on account of the accumulation of\r\n    the stars, while the rest of the heavens, at the sides, will only\r\n    seem to be scattered over with constellations, more or less crowded\r\n    according to the distance of the planes, or number of stars\r\n    contained in the thickness or sides of the stratum.\r\n\r\n    \"If the eye were placed somewhere without the stratum, at no very\r\n    great distance, the appearance of the stars within it would assume\r\n    the form of one of the smaller circles of the sphere, which would be\r\n    more or less contracted according to the distance of the eye; and,\r\n    if this distance were exceedingly increased, the whole stratum might\r\n    at last be drawn together into a lucid spot of any shape, according\r\n    to the length, breadth, and height of the stratum.\r\n\r\n    \"Suppose that a smaller stratum should branch out from the former in\r\n    a certain direction, and that it also is contained between two\r\n    parallel planes, so that the eye is contained within the great\r\n    stratum somewhere before the separation, and not far from the place\r\n    where the strata are still united. Then this second stratum will not\r\n    be projected into a bright circle like the former, but it will be\r\n    seen as a lucid branch proceeding from the first, and returning\r\n    into it again at a distance less than a semicircle. If the bounding\r\n    surfaces are not parallel planes, but irregularly curved surfaces,\r\n    analogous appearances must result.\"\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way, as we see it, presents the aspect which has been just\r\naccounted for, in its general appearance of a girdle around the heavens\r\nand in its bifurcation at a certain point, and HERSCHEL'S explanation of\r\nthis appearance, as just given, has never been seriously questioned. One\r\ndoubtful point remains: are the stars scattered all through space? or\r\nare they near its bounding planes, or clustered in any way within this\r\nspace so as to produce the same result to the eye as if uniformly\r\ndistributed?\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL assumed that they were nearly equably arranged all through the\r\nspace in question. He only examined one other arrangement, _viz._, that\r\nof a ring of stars surrounding the sun, and he pronounced against such\r\nan arrangement, for the reason that there is absolutely nothing in the\r\nsize or brilliancy of the sun to cause us to suppose it to be the centre\r\nof such a gigantic system. No reason, except its importance to us\r\npersonally, can be alleged for such a supposition. Every star will have\r\nits own appearance of a Galaxy or Milky Way, which will vary according\r\nto the situation of the star.\r\n\r\nSuch an explanation will account for the general appearances of the\r\nMilky Way and of the rest of the sky, supposing the stars equally or\r\nnearly equally distributed in space. On this supposition, the system\r\nmust be deeper where the stars appear most numerous.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL endeavored, in his early memoirs, to explain this inequality of\r\ndistribution on the fundamental assumption that the stars were nearly\r\nequably distributed in space. If they were so distributed, then the\r\nnumber of stars visible in any gauge would show the thickness of the\r\nstellar system in the direction in which the telescope was pointed.\r\nAt each pointing, the field of view of the instrument includes all the\r\nvisible stars situated within a cone, having its vortex at the\r\nobserver's eye, and its base at the very limits of the system, the angle\r\nof the cone (at the eye) being 15'. Then the cubes of the\r\nperpendiculars let fall from the eye, on the plane of the bases of the\r\nvarious visual cones, are proportional to the solid contents of the\r\ncones themselves, or, as the stars are supposed equally scattered within\r\nall the cones, the cube roots of the numbers of stars in each of the\r\nfields express the relative lengths of the perpendiculars. A _section_\r\nof the sidereal system along any great circle can be constructed from\r\nthe data furnished by the gauges in the following way:\r\n\r\nThe solar system is within the mass of stars. From this point lines are\r\ndrawn along the different directions in which the gauging telescope was\r\npointed. On these lines are laid off lengths proportional to the cube\r\nroots of the number of stars in each gauge. The irregular line joining\r\nthe terminal points will be approximately the bounding curve of the\r\nstellar system in the great circle chosen. Within this line the space is\r\nnearly uniformly filled with stars. Without it is empty space. A similar\r\nsection can be constructed in any other great circle, and a combination\r\nof all such would give a representation of the shape of our stellar\r\nsystem. The more numerous and careful the observations, the more\r\nelaborate the representation, and the 863 gauges of HERSCHEL are\r\nsufficient to mark out with great precision the main features of the\r\nMilky Way, and even to indicate some of its chief irregularities.\r\n\r\nOn the fundamental assumption of HERSCHEL (equable distribution), no\r\nother conclusion can be drawn from his statistics but the one laid down\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nThis assumption he subsequently modified in some degree, and was led to\r\nregard his gauges as indicating not so much the _depth of the system_ in\r\nany direction, as the _clustering power or tendency_ of the stars in\r\nthose special regions. It is clear that if in any given part of the sky,\r\nwhere, on the average, there are ten stars (say) to a field, we should\r\nfind a certain small portion having 100 or more to a field, then, on\r\nHERSCHEL'S first hypothesis, rigorously interpreted, it would be\r\nnecessary to suppose a spike-shaped protuberance directed from the\r\nearth, in order to explain the increased number of stars. If many such\r\nplaces could be found, then the probability is great that this\r\nexplanation is wrong. We should more rationally suppose some real\r\ninequality of star distribution here. It is, in fact, in just such\r\ndetails that the method of HERSCHEL breaks down, and a careful\r\nexamination of his system leads to the belief that it must be greatly\r\nmodified to cover all the known facts, while it undoubtedly has, in the\r\nmain, a strong basis.\r\n\r\nThe stars are certainly not uniformly distributed, and any general\r\ntheory of the sidereal system must take into account the varied tendency\r\nto aggregation in various parts of the sky.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, HERSCHEL published an important memoir on the same subject, in\r\nwhich his first method was largely modified, though not abandoned. Its\r\nfundamental principle was stated by him as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"It is evident that we cannot mean to affirm that the stars of the\r\n    fifth, sixth, and seventh magnitudes are really smaller than those\r\n    of the first, second, or third, and that we must ascribe the cause\r\n    of the difference in the apparent magnitudes of the stars to a\r\n    difference in their relative distances from us. On account of the\r\n    great number of stars in each class, we must also allow that the\r\n    stars of each succeeding magnitude, beginning with the first, are,\r\n    one with another, further from us than those of the magnitude\r\n    immediately preceding. The relative magnitudes give only relative\r\n    distances, and can afford no information as to the real distances at\r\n    which the stars are placed.\r\n\r\n    \"A standard of reference for the arrangement of the stars may be had\r\n    by comparing their distribution to a certain properly modified\r\n    equality of scattering. The equality which I propose does not\r\n    require that the stars should be at equal distances from each other,\r\n    nor is it necessary that all those of the same nominal magnitude\r\n    should be equally distant from us.\"\r\n\r\nIt consisted in allotting a certain equal portion of space to every\r\nstar, so that, on the whole, each equal portion of space within the\r\nstellar system contains an equal number of stars. The space about each\r\nstar can be considered spherical. Suppose such a sphere to surround our\r\nown sun. Its radius will not differ greatly from the distance of the\r\nnearest fixed star, and this is taken as the unit of distance.\r\n\r\nSuppose a series of larger spheres, all drawn around our sun as a\r\ncentre, and having the radii 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. The contents of the\r\nspheres being as the cubes of their diameters, the first sphere will\r\nhave 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 times the volume of the unit sphere, and will\r\ntherefore be large enough to contain 27 stars; the second will have 125\r\ntimes the volume, and will therefore contain 125 stars, and so on with\r\nthe successive spheres. For instance, the sphere of radius 7 has room\r\nfor 343 stars, but of this space 125 parts belong to the spheres inside\r\nof it; there is, therefore, room for 218 stars between the spheres of\r\nradii 5 and 7.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL designates the several distances of these layers of stars as\r\norders; the stars between spheres 1 and 3 are of the first order of\r\ndistance, those between 3 and 5 of the second order, and so on.\r\nComparing the room for stars between the several spheres with the number\r\nof stars of the several magnitudes which actually exists in the sky, he\r\nfound the result to be as follows:\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Order of  |  Number of   |             |  Number of\r\n    Distance. | Stars there  |  Magnitude. | Stars of that\r\n              | is Room for. |             |  Magnitude.\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------\r\n    1........ |      26      |      1      |      17\r\n    2........ |      98      |      2      |      57\r\n    3........ |     218      |      3      |     206\r\n    4........ |     386      |      4      |     454\r\n    5........ |     602      |      5      |   1,161\r\n    6........ |     866      |      6      |   6,103\r\n    7........ |   1,178      |      7      |   6,146\r\n    8........ |   1,538      |             |\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe result of this comparison is, that if the order of magnitudes could\r\nindicate the distance of the stars, it would denote at first a gradual\r\nand afterward a very abrupt condensation of them, at and beyond the\r\nregion of the sixth-magnitude stars.\r\n\r\nIf we assume the brightness of any star to be inversely proportional to\r\nthe square of its distance, it leads to a scale of distance different\r\nfrom that adopted by HERSCHEL, so that a sixth-magnitude star on the\r\ncommon scale would be about of the eighth order of distance according to\r\nthis scheme--that is, we must remove a star of the first magnitude to\r\neight times its actual distance to make it shine like a star of the\r\nsixth magnitude.\r\n\r\nOn the scheme here laid down, HERSCHEL subsequently assigned the _order_\r\nof distance of various objects, mostly star-clusters, and his estimates\r\nof these distances are still quoted. They rest on the fundamental\r\nhypothesis which has been explained, and the error in the assumption of\r\nequal intrinsic brilliancy for all stars affects these estimates. It is\r\nperhaps probable that the hypothesis of equal brilliancy for all stars\r\nis still more erroneous than the hypothesis of equal distribution, and\r\nit may well be that there is a very large range indeed in the actual\r\ndimensions and in the intrinsic brilliancy of stars at the same order of\r\ndistance from us, so that the tenth-magnitude stars, for example, may be\r\nscattered throughout the spheres which HERSCHEL would assign to the\r\nseventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth\r\nmagnitudes. However this may be, the fact remains that it is from\r\nHERSCHEL'S groundwork that future investigators must build. He found the\r\nwhole subject in utter confusion. By his observations, data for the\r\nsolution of some of the most general questions were accumulated, and in\r\nhis memoirs, which STRUVE well calls \"immortal,\" he brought the\r\nscattered facts into order and gave the first bold outlines of a\r\nreasonable theory. He is the founder of a new branch of astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Researches for a Scale of Celestial Measures.\r\n                        Distances of the Stars._\r\n\r\nIf the stars are _supposed_ all of the same absolute brightness, their\r\nbrightness to the eye will depend only upon their distance from us. If\r\nwe call the brightness of one of the fixed stars at the distance of\r\n_Sirius_, which may be used as the unity of distance, 1, then if it is\r\nmoved to the distance 2, its apparent brightness will be one-fourth; if\r\nto the distance 3, one-ninth; if to the distance 4, one-sixteenth, and\r\nso on, the apparent brightness diminishing as the square of the distance\r\nincreases. The distance may be taken as an order of magnitude. Stars at\r\nthe _distances_ two, three, four, etc., HERSCHEL called of the second,\r\nthird, and fourth magnitudes.\r\n\r\nBy a series of experiments, the details of which cannot be given here,\r\nHERSCHEL determined the space-penetrating power of each of his\r\ntelescopes. The twenty-foot would penetrate into space seventy-five\r\ntimes farther than the naked eye; the twenty-five foot, ninety-six\r\ntimes; and the forty-foot, one hundred and ninety-two times. If the\r\nseventh-magnitude stars are those just visible to the naked eye, and if\r\nwe still suppose all stars to be of equal intrinsic brightness, such\r\nseventh-magnitude stars would remain visible in the forty-foot, even if\r\nremoved to 1,344 times the distance of _Sirius_ (1,344 = 7 × 192).\r\nIf, further, we suppose that the visibility of a star is strictly\r\nproportional to the total intensity of the light from it which strikes\r\nthe eye, then a condensed cluster of 25,000 stars of the 1,344th\r\nmagnitude could still be seen in the forty-foot at a distance where each\r\nstar would have become 25,000 times fainter, that is, at about 158 times\r\nthe distance of _Sirius_ (158 × 158 = 24,964). The light from the\r\nnearest star requires some three years to reach the earth. From a star\r\n1,344 times farther it would require about 4,000 years, and for such a\r\ncluster as we have imagined no less than 600,000 years are needed. That\r\nis, the light by which we see such a group has not just now left it.\r\nOn the contrary, it has been travelling through space for centuries and\r\ncenturies since it first darted forth. It is the ancient history of such\r\ngroups that we are studying now, and it was thus that HERSCHEL declared\r\nthat telescopes penetrated into time as well as into space.\r\n\r\nOther more exact researches on the relative light of stars were made by\r\nHERSCHEL. These were only one more attempt to obtain a scale of\r\ncelestial distances, according to which some notion of the limits and of\r\nthe interior dimensions of the universe could be gained. Two telescopes,\r\n_exactly equal_ in every respect, were chosen and placed side by side.\r\nPairs of stars which were _exactly equal_, were selected by means of\r\nthem. By diminishing the aperture of one telescope directed to a bright\r\nstar, and keeping the other telescope unchanged and directed to a\r\nfainter star, the two stars could be equalized in light, and, from the\r\nrelative size of the apertures, the relative light of this pair of stars\r\ncould be accurately computed, and so on for other pairs. This was the\r\nfirst use of the method of _limiting apertures_. His general results\r\nwere that the stars of the first magnitude would still remain visible to\r\nthe naked eye, even if they were at a distance from us _twelve_ times\r\ntheir actual distance.\r\n\r\nThis method received a still further development at his hands. He did\r\nnot leave it until he had gained all the information it was capable of\r\ngiving. He prepared a set of telescopes collecting 4, 9, 16, etc.\r\n(2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, etc.), times as much light as the naked eye.\r\nThese were to extend the determinations of distance to the telescopic\r\nstars. For example, a certain portion of the heavens which he examined\r\ncontained no star visible to the naked eye, but many telescopic stars.\r\nWe cannot say that no one of these is as bright in itself as some of our\r\nfirst-magnitude stars. The smallest telescope of the set showed a large\r\nnumber of stars; these must, then, be _twice_ as far from us, on the\r\naverage, as the stars just visible to the naked eye. But first-magnitude\r\nstars, like _Sirius_, _Procyon_, _Arcturus_, etc., become just visible\r\nto the eye if removed to twelve times their present distance. Hence the\r\nstars seen in this first telescope of the set were between twelve and\r\ntwenty-four times as far from us as _Arcturus_, for example.\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" as HERSCHEL says, \"we are certain that if stars of the size\r\nand lustre of _Sirius_, _Arcturus_, etc., were removed into the\r\nprofundity of space I have mentioned, they would then appear like the\r\nstars which I saw.\" With the next telescope, which collected nine times\r\nmore light than the eye, and brought into view objects three times more\r\ndistant, other and new stars appeared, which were then (3 × 12)\r\nthirty-six times farther from us than _Arcturus_. In the same way, the\r\nseven-foot reflector showed stars 204 times, the ten-foot 344 times,\r\nthe twenty-foot 900 times farther from us than the average\r\nfirst-magnitude star. As the light from such a star requires three years\r\nto reach us, the light from the faintest stars seen by the twenty-foot\r\nwould require 2,700 years (3 × 900).\r\n\r\nBut HERSCHEL was now (1817) convinced that the twenty-foot telescope\r\ncould not penetrate to the boundaries of the Milky Way; the faintest\r\nstars of the Galaxy must then be farther from us even than nine hundred\r\ntimes the distance of _Arcturus_, and their light must be at least 3,000\r\nyears old when it reaches us.\r\n\r\nThere is no escaping a certain part of the consequences established by\r\nHERSCHEL. It is indeed true that unless a particular star is of the same\r\nintrinsic brightness as our largest stars, this reasoning does not apply\r\nto it; in just so far as the average star is less bright than the\r\naverage brightness of our largest stars, will the numbers which HERSCHEL\r\nobtained be diminished. But for every star of which his hypothesis is\r\ntrue, we may assert that his conclusions are true, and no one can deny,\r\nwith any show of reason, that, on the whole, his suppositions must be\r\nvalid. On the whole, the stars which we call faint are farther from us\r\nthan the brighter ones; and, on the whole, the brilliancy of our\r\nbrightest and nearest stars is not very far from the brilliancy of the\r\naverage star in space. We cannot yet define the word _very_ by a\r\nnumerical ratio.\r\n\r\nThe _method_ struck out by HERSCHEL was correct; it is for his\r\nsuccessors to look for the special cases and limitations, to answer the\r\nquestion, At a certain distance from us, what are the variations which\r\nactually take place in the brilliancy and the sizes of stars? The answer\r\nto this question is to be found in the study of the clusters of regular\r\nforms, where we _know_ the stars to be all at the same distance from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Researches on Light and Heat, Etc._\r\n\r\nFrequently in the course of his astronomical work, HERSCHEL found\r\nhimself confronted by questions of physics which could not be\r\nimmediately answered in the state of the science at that time. In his\r\nefforts to find a method for determining the dimensions of the stellar\r\nuniverse, he was finally led, as has been shown, to regard the\r\nbrightness of a star as, in general, the best attainable measure of its\r\ndistance from us. His work, however, was done with telescopes of various\r\ndimensions and powers, and it was therefore necessary to find some law\r\nfor comparing the different results among themselves as well as with\r\nthose given by observations with an unassisted eye. This necessity\r\nprompted an investigation, published in 1800, in which, after drawing\r\nthe distinction between absolute and intrinsic brightness, HERSCHEL gave\r\nan expression for the _space-penetrating power_ of a telescope. The\r\nreasoning at the base of this conception was as follows.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the light entering the eye when directed toward a star, to\r\nthe whole light given out by the star, would be as the area of the pupil\r\nof the eye to the area of the whole sphere having the star as a centre\r\nand our distance from the star as a radius. If the eye is assisted by a\r\ntelescope, the ratio is quite different. In that case the ratio of the\r\nlight which enters the eye to the whole light, would be as the area of\r\nthe mirror or object-glass to the area of the whole sphere having the\r\nstar as a centre and its distance as a radius. Thus the light received\r\nby the _eye_ in the two cases would be as the area of the pupil is to\r\nthe area of the object-glass. For instance, if the pupil has a diameter\r\nof two-fifths of an inch, and the mirror a diameter of four inches, then\r\na hundred times as much light would enter the eye when assisted by the\r\ntelescope as when unarmed, since the _area_ of the pupil is\r\none-hundredth the _area_ of the objective.\r\n\r\nIf a particular star is just visible to the naked eye, it will be quite\r\nbright if viewed with this special telescope, which makes it one hundred\r\ntimes more brilliant in appearance. If we could move the star bodily\r\naway from us to a distance ten times its present distance, we could thus\r\nreduce its brightness, as seen with the telescope, to what it was at\r\nfirst, as seen with the eye alone, _i. e._, to bare visibility. Moving\r\nthe star to ten times its present distance would increase the surface of\r\nthe sphere which it illuminates a hundred-fold. We cannot move any\r\nspecial star, but we can examine stars of all brightnesses, and thus\r\n(presumably) of all distances.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL'S argument was, then, as follows: Since with such a telescope\r\none can see a star ten times as far off as is possible to the naked eye,\r\nthis telescope has the power of penetrating into space ten times farther\r\nthan the eye alone. But this number ten, also, expresses the ratio of\r\nthe diameter of the objective to that of the pupil of the eye,\r\nconsequently the general law is that the _space-penetrating power_ of a\r\ntelescope is found by dividing the diameter of the mirror in inches by\r\ntwo-fifths. The diameter of the pupil of the eye (two-fifths of an inch)\r\nHERSCHEL determined by many measures.\r\n\r\nThis simple ratio would only hold good, however, provided no more light\r\nwere lost by the repeated reflections and refractions in the telescope\r\nthan in the eye. That light must be so lost was evident, but no data\r\nexisted for determining the loss. HERSCHEL was thus led to a long series\r\nof photometric experiments on the reflecting powers of the metals used\r\nin his mirrors, and on the amount of light transmitted by lenses.\r\nApplying the corrections thus deduced experimentally, he found that the\r\nspace-penetrating power of his twenty-foot telescope, with which he made\r\nhis star-gauges, was sixty-one times that of the unassisted eye, while\r\nthe space-penetrating power of his great forty-foot telescope was one\r\nhundred and ninety-two times that of the eye. In support of his\r\nimportant conclusions HERSCHEL had an almost unlimited amount of\r\nexperimental data in the records of his observations, of which he made\r\neffective use.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important of HERSCHEL'S work in the domain of pure\r\nphysics was published in the same year (1800), and related to radiant\r\nheat. The investigation of the space-penetrating powers of telescopes\r\nwas undertaken for the sole purpose of aiding him in measuring the\r\ndimensions of the stellar universe, and there was no temptation for him\r\nto pursue it beyond the limits of its immediate usefulness. But here,\r\nthough the first hint leading to remarkable discoveries was a direct\r\nconsequence of his astronomical work, the novelty and interest of the\r\nphenomena observed induced him to follow the investigation very far\r\nbeyond the mere solution of the practical question in which it\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nHaving tried many varieties of shade-glasses between the eye-piece of\r\nhis telescope and the eye, in order to reduce the inordinate degree of\r\nheat and light transmitted by the instrument when directed towards the\r\nsun, he observed that certain combinations of colored glasses permitted\r\nvery little light to pass, but transmitted so much heat that they could\r\nnot be used; while, on the other hand, different combinations and\r\ndifferently colored glasses would stop nearly all the heat, but allow an\r\ninconveniently great amount of light to pass. At the same time he\r\nnoticed, in the various experiments, that the images of the sun were of\r\ndifferent colors. This suggested the question as to whether there was\r\nnot a different heating power proper to each color of the spectrum. On\r\ncomparing the readings of sensitive thermometers exposed in different\r\nportions of an intense solar spectrum, he found that, beginning with the\r\nviolet end, he came to the maximum of light long before that of heat,\r\nwhich lay at the other extremity, that is, near the red. By several\r\nexperiments it appeared that the maximum of illumination, _i. e._, the\r\nyellow, had little more than half the heat of the full red rays; and\r\nfrom other experiments he concluded that even the full red fell short of\r\nthe maximum of heat, which, perhaps, lay even a little beyond the limits\r\nof the visible spectrum.\r\n\r\n    \"In this case,\" he says, \"radiant heat will at least partly, if not\r\n    chiefly, consist, if I may be permitted the expression, of invisible\r\n    light; that is to say, of rays coming from the sun, that have such a\r\n    momentum[35] as to be unfit for vision. And admitting, as is highly\r\n    probable, that the organs of sight are only adapted to receive\r\n    impressions from particles of a certain momentum, it explains why\r\n    the maximum of illumination should be in the middle of the\r\n    refrangible rays; as those which have greater or less momenta are\r\n    likely to become equally unfit for the impression of sight.\"\r\n\r\nIn his second paper on this subject, published in the same year,\r\nHERSCHEL describes the experiments which led to the conclusion given\r\nabove. This paper contains a remarkably interesting passage which\r\nadmirably illustrates HERSCHEL'S philosophic method.\r\n\r\n    \"To conclude, if we call light, those rays which illuminate objects,\r\n    and radiant heat, those which heat bodies, it may be inquired\r\n    whether light be essentially different from radiant heat? In answer\r\n    to which I would suggest that we are not allowed, by the rules of\r\n    philosophizing, to admit two different causes to explain certain\r\n    effects, if they may be accounted for by one. . . . If this be a true\r\n    account of the solar heat, for the support of which I appeal to my\r\n    experiments, it remains only for us to admit that such of the rays\r\n    of the sun as have the refrangibility of those which are contained\r\n    in the prismatic spectrum, by the construction of the organs of\r\n    sight, are admitted under the appearance of light and colors, and\r\n    that the rest, being stopped in the coats and humors of the eye, act\r\n    on them, as they are known to do on all the other parts of our body,\r\n    by occasioning a sensation of heat.\"\r\n\r\nWe now know that the reasoning and conclusion here given are entirely\r\ncorrect, but they have for their basis only a philosophical conception,\r\nand not a series of experiments designed especially to test their\r\ncorrectness. Such an experimental test of this important question was\r\nthe motive for a third and last paper in this department of physics.\r\nThis paper was published in volume ninety of the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_, and gave the results of two hundred and nineteen\r\nquantitative experiments.\r\n\r\nHere we are at a loss to know which to admire most--the marvellous skill\r\nevinced in acquiring such accurate data with such inadequate means, and\r\nin varying and testing such a number of questions as were suggested in\r\nthe course of the investigation--or the intellectual power shown in\r\nmarshalling and reducing to a system such intricate and apparently\r\nself-contradictory phenomena. It is true that this discussion led him to\r\na different conclusion from that announced in the previous paper, and,\r\nconsequently, to a false conclusion; but almost the only escape from his\r\ncourse of reasoning lay in a principle which belongs to a later period\r\nof intellectual development than that of HERSCHEL'S own time.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL made a careful determination of the quantitative distribution\r\nof light and of heat in the prismatic spectrum, and discovered the\r\nsurprising fact that not only where the light was at a maximum the heat\r\nwas very inconsiderable, but that where there was a maximum exhibition\r\nof heat, there was not a trace of light.\r\n\r\n    \"This consideration,\" he writes, \"must alter the form of our\r\n    proposed inquiry; for the question being thus at least partly\r\n    decided, since it is ascertained that we have rays of heat which\r\n    give no light, it can only become a subject of inquiry whether some\r\n    of these heat-making rays may not have a power of rendering objects\r\n    visible, superadded to their now already established power of\r\n    heating bodies. This being the case, it is evident that the _onus\r\n    probandi_ ought to lie with those who are willing to establish such\r\n    an hypothesis, for it does not appear that Nature is in the habit of\r\n    using one and the same mechanism with any two of our senses. Witness\r\n    the vibration of air that makes sound, the effluvia that occasion\r\n    smells, the particles that produce taste, the resistance or\r\n    repulsive powers that affect the touch--all these are evidently\r\n    suited to their respective organs of sense.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see how the fallacy of this argument could have been\r\ndetected by any one not familiar with the fundamental physiological law\r\nthat the nature of a sensation is in no wise determined by the character\r\nof the agent producing it, but only by the character of the nerves acted\r\nupon; but, as already intimated, this law belongs to a later epoch than\r\nthe one we are considering. HERSCHEL thus finally concluded that light\r\nand radiant heat were of essentially different natures, and upon this\r\nsupposition he explained all of the phenomena which his numerous\r\nexperiments had shown him. So complete and satisfactory did this work\r\nappear to the scientific world, that for a long time the question was\r\nlooked upon as closed, and not until thirty-five years later was there\r\nany dissent. Then the Italian physicist, MELLONI, with instrumental\r\nmeans a thousand times more delicate than that of HERSCHEL, and with a\r\nfar larger store of cognate phenomena, collected during the generation\r\nwhich had elapsed, to serve as a guide, discovered the true law. This,\r\nas we have seen, was at first adopted by HERSCHEL on philosophical\r\ngrounds, and then rejected, since he did not at that time possess the\r\nkey which alone could have enabled him to properly interpret his\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nIt is well to summarize the capital discoveries in this field made by\r\nHERSCHEL, more particularly because his claims as a discoverer seem to\r\nhave been strangely overlooked by historians of the development of\r\nphysical science. He, before any other investigator, showed that radiant\r\nheat is refracted according to the laws governing the refraction of\r\nlight by transparent media; that a portion of the radiation from the sun\r\nis incapable of exciting the sensation of vision, and that this portion\r\nis the less refrangible; that the different colors of the spectrum\r\npossess very unequal heating powers, which are not proportional to their\r\nluminosity; that substances differ very greatly in their power of\r\ntransmitting radiant heat, and that this power does not depend solely\r\nupon their color; and that the property of diffusing heat is possessed\r\nto a varying degree by different bodies, independently of their color.\r\nNor should we neglect to emphasize, in this connection, the importance\r\nof his measurements of the intensity of the heat and light in the\r\ndifferent portions of the solar spectrum. It is the more necessary to\r\nstate HERSCHEL'S claims clearly, as his work has been neglected by those\r\nwho should first have done him justice. In his \"History of Physics,\"\r\nPOGGENDORFF has no reference to HERSCHEL. In the collected works of\r\nVERDET, long bibliographical notes are appended to each chapter, with\r\nthe intention of exhibiting the progress and order of discovery. But all\r\nof HERSCHEL'S work is overlooked, or indexed under the name of his son.\r\nOne little reference in the text alone shows that his very name was not\r\nunknown. Even in the great work of HELMHOLTZ on physiological optics,\r\nHERSCHEL'S labors are not taken account of.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to account for this seemingly strange neglect. HERSCHEL is\r\nknown to this generation only as an astronomer. A study of his memoirs\r\nwill show that his physical work alone should give him a very high rank\r\nindeed, and I trust that the brief summaries, which alone can be given\r\nhere, will have made this plain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may conclude from the time expended, the elaborate nature of the\r\nexperiments involved, and the character of the papers devoted to their\r\nconsideration, that the portion of HERSCHEL'S researches in physics\r\nwhich interested him to the greatest degree, was the investigation of\r\nthe optical phenomena known as NEWTON'S rings. In 1792 he obtained the\r\ntwo object-glasses of HUYGHENS, which were in the possession of the\r\nRoyal Society, for the purpose of repeating NEWTON'S experiments, and in\r\n1810 he read the last of his three papers on the subject.\r\n\r\nSir ISAAC NEWTON had given some of his most vigorous efforts to the\r\nstudy of the phenomena of interference of light, which are exemplified\r\nin the colors of thin and of thick plates. The colors of thin plates are\r\nmost conveniently studied in the regular form which they present when\r\nproduced by a thin plate of air, limited on one side by a plane\r\npolished surface, and on the other by a spherical surface of long\r\nradius, such as the exterior surface of a convex lens, for example.\r\nThe colors are then arranged in concentric circles, and, though others\r\nhad so produced them before NEWTON, these rings have, ever since the\r\npublication of his remarkable work, been known by his name.\r\n\r\nTo explain the phenomena, NEWTON was obliged to supplement his theory of\r\nthe corpuscular nature of light, by supposing that the inconceivably\r\nminute particles constituting light are not always equally susceptible\r\nof reflection, but that they have periodically recurring \"fits of easy\r\nreflection\" and of \"easy transmission.\" This conception, though by no\r\nmeans unphilosophical, seemed to HERSCHEL too artificial and improbable\r\nfor ready acceptance, and his effort was to supply a more probable\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe developments of optical science have justified HERSCHEL in his\r\nobjections, but we cannot accord to him must any considerable part in\r\nmaking clear the true nature of the phenomenon. Indeed, it must be\r\nrecognized that his position was distinctly less advanced than that of\r\nNEWTON. That great philosopher announced the true law governing the\r\nrelation between the color and the thickness of the film. HERSCHEL did\r\nnot recognize such a relation. NEWTON showed exactly how the phenomenon\r\ndepended upon the obliquity at which it was viewed. HERSCHEL found no\r\nplace in his theory for this evident variation.\r\n\r\nIn the series of experiments described in the first paper on this\r\nsubject, HERSCHEL mistook the locus of a certain set of rings which he\r\nwas observing. This mistake, though so slight as hardly to be detected\r\nwithout the guidance of the definite knowledge acquired in later times,\r\nnot only vitiated the conclusion from the experiments, but gave an\r\nerroneous direction to the whole investigation. To him these experiments\r\nproved that NEWTON'S conception of a periodic phenomenon was untenable.\r\nThus cut loose from all hypothesis, his fertility in ideas and ingenuity\r\nin experimentation are as striking as ever. He tried the effect of\r\nhaving a polished metal as one of the surfaces limiting the thin plate\r\nof air. Observing the so-called \"blue bow\" of NEWTON at the limit of\r\ntotal reflection in a prism, he was led to the discovery of its\r\ncomplement, the \"red bow\" by refraction. Here he thought he had found\r\nthe solution of his problem, and attributed the rings to the reflection\r\nof the light which passed through in the red bow. Though mistaken, he\r\nhad presented to the world of science two experiments which have since\r\nplayed very prominent parts in the undulatory theory of light, namely,\r\nthe rings formed upon polished metal, and the bands produced by a thin\r\nplate near the critical angle.\r\n\r\nAs in his later researches upon the nature of radiant heat, he was wrong\r\nin his conclusions, and perhaps with less excuse. His experiments were\r\nskilfully devised and most ingenious. His philosophizing was distinctly\r\nfaulty. We can see not only that he was wrong, but exactly where he\r\nbegan to go wrong. Yet these papers are full of interest to the\r\nphysicist, and by no means deserve the neglect into which they have\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Researches on the Dimensions of the Stars._\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL examined a number of bright stars, using extremely high\r\nmagnifying powers, in order to determine whether the stars have sensible\r\ndimensions. In a good telescope stars present round and pretty uniformly\r\nilluminated disks. If these disks really represent the angular diameter\r\nof the stars, they should admit of magnifying, like other objects; but,\r\ninstead of this, HERSCHEL found that they appeared smaller as the\r\ntelescopic power was increased. He accordingly called the disk of light\r\nseen in the telescope a spurious disk. This singular phenomenon gave its\r\ndiscoverer a ready criterion for determining whether a small bright body\r\nhas an appreciable size, or only impresses the sense of sight by virtue\r\nof its intrinsic brightness. If the first were the case, the apparent\r\nsize would increase with increased magnifying power, while, if the\r\nangular dimensions were inappreciable, the apparent size would, on the\r\ncontrary, diminish with additional magnifying. An occasion for using\r\nthis criterion came in the first years of this century, with the\r\ndiscovery of three small planets having orbits lying between those of\r\n_Mars_ and _Jupiter_. HERSCHEL gave the name _Asteroids_ to these\r\nbodies. As the appropriateness of this term had been violently assailed,\r\nthe discovery of _Juno_, in 1804, the third one of the group, led to a\r\ncareful experimental study of the defining power of the telescope used,\r\nand of the laws governing the phenomena of spurious disks.\r\n\r\nWith a telescope of about nine inches in aperture, HERSCHEL found that\r\nif _Juno_ subtended an angle greater than a quarter of a second of arc,\r\na certain indication of the fact would have shown itself in the course\r\nof the experiments. This conclusion was a justification of the name\r\nAsteroid, since the appearance of the new planet was strictly stellar.\r\nOn other grounds, a better name might have been selected.\r\n\r\nIn the paper giving the results of the experiments, the phenomena of the\r\nspurious disks are very completely described; but they did not attract\r\nthe attention which they deserved, and they only became an object of\r\nespecial interest to students of physics when they were again studied by\r\nthe famous German optician FRAUNHOFER, a generation later.\r\n\r\nIncidentally the experiments are of interest, as yielding us a measure\r\nof the excellence of HERSCHEL'S telescopes, and a measure which is quite\r\nindependent of the keenness of his vision. From them we may be sure that\r\nthe efficiency of the nine-inch mirror used was not sensibly less than\r\nthat of the highest theoretically attainable excellence. In this\r\nconnection, too, we may refer to the _Philosophical Transactions_ for\r\n1790, pp. 468 and 475, where HERSCHEL gives observations of both\r\n_Enceladus_ and _Mimas_ seen in contact with the ball of _Saturn_.\r\nI have never seen so good definition, telescopic and atmospheric, as he\r\nmust have had on these occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Researches on the Spectra of the Fixed Stars._\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope was applied by SECCHI to the study of the spectra of\r\nthe fixed stars visible to the naked eye in the years 1863 to 1866.\r\nHe examined the nature of the spectrum of each of the larger stars,\r\nand found that these stars could be arranged in three general classes or\r\n_types_. His results have been verified and extended by other\r\nastronomers, and his classification has been generally accepted.\r\nAccording to SECCHI, the lucid stars may be separated into three groups,\r\ndistinguished by marked differences in their spectra. SECCHI'S Type I.\r\ncontains stars whose spectra are like those of _Sirius_, _Procyon_, and\r\n_[alpha] Lyræ_; his Type II. stars like _Arcturus_ and _Aldebaran_;\r\nhis Type III. stars like _[alpha] Orionis_.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL also made some trials in this direction. In the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1814 (p. 264), he says:\r\n\r\n    \"By some experiments on the light of a few of the stars of the first\r\n    magnitude, made in 1798, by a prism applied to the eye-glasses of my\r\n    reflectors, adjustable to any angle and to any direction, I had the\r\n    following analyses:\r\n\r\n    \"The light of _Sirius_ consists of red, orange, yellow, green, blue,\r\n    purple, and violet. _[alpha] Orionis_ contains the same colors,\r\n    but the red is more intense, and the orange and yellow are less\r\n    copious in proportion than they are in _Sirius_. _Procyon_ contains\r\n    all the colors, but proportionately more blue and purple than\r\n    _Sirius_. _Arcturus_ contains more red and orange, and less yellow\r\n    in proportion than _Sirius_. _Aldebaran_ contains much orange and\r\n    very little yellow. _[alpha] Lyræ_ contains much yellow, green,\r\n    blue, and purple.\"\r\n\r\nHere the essential peculiarities of the spectrum of each of the stars\r\ninvestigated by HERSCHEL is pointed out, and if we were to use his\r\nobservations alone to classify these stars into types, we should put\r\n_Sirius_ and _Procyon_ into one type of stars which have \"all the\r\ncolors\" in their spectra; _Arcturus_ and _Aldebaran_ would represent\r\nanother group of stars, with a deficiency of yellow and an excess of\r\norange and red in the spectrum; and _[alpha] Orionis_ would stand as\r\na type of those stars with an excess of red and a deficiency of orange.\r\n_[alpha] Lyræ_ would represent a sub-group of the first class.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL'S immediate object was not classification, and his observations\r\nare only recorded in a passing way. But the fact remains that he\r\nclearly distinguished the essential differences of the spectra of these\r\nstars, and that he made these observations in support of his statement\r\nthat the fixed stars, \"like the planets, also shine with differently\r\ncolored light. That of _Arcturus_ and _Aldebaran_, for instance, is as\r\ndifferent from the light of _Sirius_ and _Capella_ as that of _Mars_ and\r\n_Saturn_ is from the light of _Venus_ and _Jupiter_.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, no special discovery can be claimed for him on these few\r\ninstances. We can see, however, a good example of the manner in which he\r\nexamined a subject from every side, and used the most remote evidence\r\nexactly in its proper place and time.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Researches on the Variable Emission of Light\r\n                  and Heat from the Sun._\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a remarkable fact that HERSCHEL was the first observer\r\nto recognize the real importance of the aperture or diameter of a\r\ntelescope. Before his time it was generally assumed that this element\r\nonly conditioned the amount of light transmitted to the eye, or, in\r\nother words, merely determined the brightness of the image. Hence the\r\nconclusion that if an object is sufficiently bright, the telescope may\r\nbe made as small as desired without loss of power. Thus, in observing\r\nthe sun, astronomers before HERSCHEL had been accustomed to reduce the\r\naperture of their telescopes, in order to moderate the heat and light\r\ntransmitted. SCHEINER, it is true, nearly two centuries before the time\r\nwe are considering, had invented a method for observing the sun without\r\ndanger, still employing the full aperture. This was by projecting the\r\nimage of the sun on a white screen beyond the eye-piece, the telescope\r\nbeing slightly lengthened. For special purposes this ingenious method\r\nhas even been found useful in modern times, though for sharpness of\r\ndefinition it bears much the same relation to the more usual manner of\r\nobserving, that a photographic picture does to direct vision.\r\n\r\nAlthough HERSCHEL saw the advantages of using the whole aperture of a\r\ntelescope in such observations, the practical difficulties in the way\r\nwere very great. We have noted his attempts to find screens which would\r\neffectively cut off a large portion of the heat and light without\r\nimpairing vision, and have considered, somewhat in detail, the\r\nremarkable discoveries in radiant heat to which these attempts led him.\r\nHis efforts were not unsuccessful. A green glass smoked, and a glass\r\ncell containing a solution of black writing ink in water--were found to\r\nwork admirably.\r\n\r\nThus provided with more powerful instrumental means than had ever been\r\napplied to the purpose, HERSCHEL turned his attention to the sun. In a\r\nvery short time he exhausted nearly all there was to be discovered, so\r\nthat since the publication of his last paper on this subject, in 1801,\r\nuntil the present time, there has been but a single telescopic\r\nphenomenon, connected with the physical appearance of the sun, which was\r\nunknown to HERSCHEL. That phenomenon is the frequent occurrence of a\r\ndarker central shade or kernel in large spots, discovered by DAWES about\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL, though observing a hundred and ninety years after the earliest\r\ndiscovery of sun spots, seems to have been the first to suspect their\r\nperiodic character. To establish this as a fact, and to measure the\r\nperiod, was left for our own times and for the indefatigable observer\r\nSCHWABE. The probable importance of such a period in its relation to\r\nterrestrial meteorology was not only clearly pointed out by HERSCHEL,\r\nbut he even attempted to demonstrate, from such data as were obtainable,\r\nthe character of this influence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one thing which this great philosopher has done better\r\nexhibits the catholic character of his mind than this research. When the\r\npossible connection of solar and terrestrial phenomena occurred to him\r\nas a question to be tested, there were no available meteorological\r\nrecords, and he could find but four or five short series of\r\nobservations, widely separated in time. To an ordinary thinker the task\r\nwould have seemed hopeless until more data had been collected. But\r\nHERSCHEL'S fertile mind, though it could not recall lost opportunities\r\nfor solar observations, did find a substitute for meteorological records\r\nin the statistics of the prices of grain during the various epochs.\r\nIt is clear that the price of wheat must have depended upon the supply,\r\nand the supply, in turn, largely upon the character of the season.\r\nThe method, as ingenious as it is, failed in HERSCHEL'S hands on account\r\nof the paucity of solar statistics; but it has since proved of value,\r\nand has taken its place as a recognized method of research.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Researches on Nebulæ and Clusters._\r\n\r\nWhen HERSCHEL first began to observe the nebulæ in 1774, there were\r\nvery few of these objects known. The nebulæ of _Orion_ and _Andromeda_\r\nhad been known in Europe only a little over a hundred years.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 MESSIER published a list of sixty-eight such objects which he\r\nhad found in his searches for comets, and twenty-eight nebulæ had been\r\nfound by LACAILLE in his observations at the Cape of Good Hope. In the\r\nmere discovery of these objects HERSCHEL quickly surpassed all others.\r\nIn 1786 he published a catalogue of one thousand new nebulæ, in 1789 a\r\ncatalogue of a second thousand, and in 1802 one of five hundred. In all\r\nhe discovered and described two thousand five hundred and eight new\r\nnebulæ and clusters. This branch of astronomy may almost be said to be\r\nproper to the HERSCHELS, father and son. Sir JOHN HERSCHEL re-observed\r\nall his father's nebulæ in the northern hemisphere, and added many new\r\nones, and in his astronomical expedition to the Cape of Good Hope he\r\nrecorded almost an equal number in the southern sky.\r\n\r\nOf the six thousand two hundred nebulæ now known the HERSCHELS\r\ndiscovered at least eight-tenths. The mere discovery of twenty-five\r\nhundred nebulæ would have been a brilliant addition to our knowledge of\r\ncelestial statistics.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL did more than merely point out the existence and position of\r\nthese new bodies. Each observation was accompanied by a careful and\r\nminute description of the object viewed, and with sketches and diagrams\r\nwhich gave the position of the small stars in it and near it.[36]\r\n\r\nAs the nebulæ and clusters were discovered they were placed in classes,\r\neach class covering those nebulæ which resembled each other in their\r\ngeneral features. Even at the telescope HERSCHEL'S object was not\r\ndiscovery merely, but to know the inner constitution of the heavens.\r\nHis classes were arranged with this end, and they are to-day adopted.\r\nThey were:\r\n\r\n  CLASS I. \"Bright nebulæ (288 in all).\r\n       II. \"Faint nebulæ (909 in all).\r\n      III. \"Very faint nebulæ (984 in all).\r\n       IV. \"Planetary nebulæ, stars with burs, with milky chevelure,\r\n              with short rays, remarkable shapes, etc. (79 in all).\r\n        V. \"Very large nebulæ (52 in all).\r\n       VI. \"Very compressed and rich clusters of stars (42 in all).\r\n      VII. \"Pretty much compressed clusters (67 in all).\r\n     VIII. \"Coarsely scattered clusters of stars\" (88 in all).\r\n\r\nThe lists of these classes were the storehouses of rich material from\r\nwhich HERSCHEL drew the examples by which his later opinions on the\r\nphysical conditions of nebulous matter were enforced.\r\n\r\nAs the nebulæ were discovered and classified they were placed upon a\r\nstar-map in their proper positions (1786), and, as the discoveries went\r\non, the real laws of the distribution of the nebulæ and of the clusters\r\nover the surface of the sky showed themselves more and more plainly. It\r\nwas by this means that HERSCHEL was led to the announcement of the law\r\nthat the spaces richest in nebulæ are distant from the Milky Way, etc.\r\nBy no other means could he have detected this, and I believe this to\r\nhave been the first example of the use of the graphical method, now\r\nbecome common in treating large masses of statistics.\r\n\r\nIt is still in his capacity of an observer--an acute and wise one--that\r\nHERSCHEL is considered. But this was the least of his gifts. This vast\r\nmass of material was not left in this state: it served him for a\r\nstepping-stone to larger views of the nature and extent of the nebulous\r\nmatter itself.\r\n\r\nHis views on the nature of nebulæ underwent successive changes. At first\r\nhe supposed all nebulæ to be but aggregations of stars. The logic was\r\nsimple. To the naked eye there are many groups of stars which appear\r\nnebulous. _Praesepe_ is, perhaps, the best example. The slightest\r\ntelescopic power applied to such groups alters the nebulous appearance,\r\nand shows that it comes from the combined and confused light of discrete\r\nstars. Other groups which remain nebulous in a seven-foot telescope,\r\nbecome stellar in a ten-foot. The nebulosity of the ten-foot can be\r\nresolved into stars by the twenty-foot, and so on. The nebulæ which\r\nremained still unresolved, it was reasonable to conclude, would yield to\r\nhigher power, and generally a nebula was but a group of stars removed to\r\na great distance. An increase of telescopic power was alone necessary to\r\ndemonstrate this.[37]\r\n\r\n    \"Nebulæ can be selected so that an insensible gradation shall take\r\n    place from a coarse cluster like the _Pleiades_ down to a milky\r\n    nebulosity like that in _Orion_, every intermediate step being\r\n    represented. This tends to confirm the hypothesis that all are\r\n    composed of stars more or less remote.\"\r\n\r\nSo, at first, HERSCHEL believed that his twenty-foot telescope was of\r\npower sufficient to fathom the Milky Way, that is, to see through it and\r\nbeyond it, and to reduce all its nebulosities to true groups of stars.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 he published a memoir on _Nebulous Stars_, in which his views\r\nwere completely changed. He had found a nebulous star, the sixty-ninth\r\nof his Class IV., to which his reasons would not apply. In the centre of\r\nit was a bright star; around the star was a halo gradually diminishing\r\nin brightness from the star outward, and perfectly circular. It was\r\nclear the two parts, star and nebula, were connected, and thus at the\r\nsame distance from us.\r\n\r\nThere were two possible solutions only. Either the whole mass was,\r\n_first_, composed of stars, in which case the nucleus would be\r\nenormously larger than the other stars of its stellar magnitude\r\nelsewhere in the sky, or the stars which made up the halo indefinitely\r\nsmall; or, _second_, the central nucleus was indeed a star, but a star\r\nsurrounded with \"a shining fluid, of a nature totally unknown to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe long strata of nebulæ, which he had before described under the name\r\nof \"telescopic Milky Ways,\" might well be accounted for by masses of\r\nthis fluid lying beyond the regions of the seventh-magnitude stars. This\r\nfluid might exist independently of stars. If it is self-luminous, it\r\nseems more fit to produce a star by its condensation, than to depend\r\nupon the star for its own existence. Such were a few of the theorems to\r\nwhich his discovery of this nebula led him. The hypothesis of an elastic\r\n_shining fluid_ existing in space, sometimes in connection with stars,\r\nsometimes distinct from them, was adopted and never abandoned. How well\r\nthe spectroscope has confirmed this idea it is not necessary to say.\r\nWe know the shining fluid does exist, and in late years we have seen the\r\nreverse of the process imagined by HERSCHEL. A star has actually, under\r\nour eyes, become a planetary nebula, and the cycle of which he gave the\r\nfirst terms is complete.\r\n\r\nIn five separate memoirs (1802, 1811, 1814, 1817, and 1818) HERSCHEL\r\nelaborated his views of the sidereal system. The whole extent of his\r\nviews must be gained from the extended memoirs themselves. Here only the\r\nmerest outline can be given.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 there is a marshaling of the various objects beyond our solar\r\nsystem. The stars themselves may be _insulated_, or may belong to\r\n_binary_ or _multiple_ systems, to _clusters_ and groups, or to grand\r\ngroups like the Milky Way. Nebulæ may have any of the forms which have\r\nbeen described; and, in 1811, he gives examples of immense spaces in the\r\nsky covered with diffused and very faint nebulosity. \"Its abundance\r\nexceeds all imagination.\"[38] These masses of nebular matter are the\r\nseats of attracting forces, and these forces must produce condensation.\r\nWhen a nebula has more than one preponderating seat of attracting\r\nmatter, it may in time be divided, and the double nebulæ have had such\r\nan origin. When nebulæ appear to us as round masses, they are in reality\r\nglobular in form, and this form is at once the effect and the proof of a\r\ngravitating cause.\r\n\r\nThe central brightness of nebulæ points out the seat of the attraction;\r\nand the completeness of the approximation to a spherical form points out\r\nthe length of time that the gravitating forces have been at work. Those\r\nnebulæ (and clusters) which are most perfect in the globular form, have\r\nbeen longest exposed to central forces. The planetary nebulæ are the\r\noldest in our system. They must have a rotatory motion on their axes.\r\n\r\nBy progressive condensation planetary nebulæ may be successively\r\nconverted into bright stellar nebulæ, or into nebulous stars, and these\r\nagain, by the effects of the same cause, into insulated or double stars.\r\nThis chain of theorems, laid down in the memoir of 1811, is enforced in\r\n1814 with examples which show how the nebulous appearance may grow into\r\nthe sidereal. HERSCHEL selects from the hundreds of instances in his\r\nnote-books, nebulæ in every stage of progress, and traces the effect of\r\ncondensation and of clustering power through all its course, even to the\r\nfinal breaking up of the Milky Way itself.\r\n\r\nThe memoirs of 1817 and 1818 add little to the general view of the\r\nphysical constitution of the heavens. They are attempts to gain a scale\r\nof celestial measures by which we may judge of the distances of the\r\nstars and clusters in which these changes are going on.\r\n\r\nThere is little to change in HERSCHEL'S statement of the general\r\nconstruction of the heavens. It is the groundwork upon which we have\r\nstill to build. Every astronomical discovery and every physical fact\r\nwell observed is material for the elaboration of its details or for the\r\ncorrection of some of its minor points. As a scientific conception it is\r\nperhaps the grandest that has ever entered into the human mind. As a\r\nstudy of the height to which the efforts of one man may go, it is almost\r\nwithout a parallel. The philosopher who will add to it to-day, will have\r\nhis facts and his methods ready to his hands. HERSCHEL presents the\r\nalmost unique example of an eager observer marshaling the multitude of\r\nsingle instances, which he himself has laboriously gathered, into a\r\ncompact and philosophic whole. In spite of minor errors and defects, his\r\nideas of the nature of the sidereal universe have prevailed, and are\r\nto-day the unacknowledged basis of our every thought upon it. Some of\r\nits most secret processes have been worked out by him, and the paths\r\nwhich he pointed out are those along which our advances must be made.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this condensed account of HERSCHEL'S scientific labors,\r\nit behoves us to remember that there was nothing due to accident in his\r\nlong life. He was born with the faculties which fitted him for the\r\ngigantic labors which he undertook, and he had the firm basis of energy\r\nand principle which kept him steadily to his work.\r\n\r\nAs a practical astronomer he remains without an equal. In profound\r\nphilosophy he has few superiors. By a kindly chance he can be claimed as\r\nthe citizen of no one country. In very truth his is one of the few names\r\nwhich belong to the whole world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] JAMES SHORT, F.R.S. (1710-1768), and JOHN DOLLOND, F.R.S.\r\n(1706-1761), were the most celebrated makers of telescopes of their day.\r\nThe six-foot Newtonian reflectors of SHORT (aperture 9.4 inches), and\r\nthe forty-six-inch achromatics of DOLLOND (aperture 3.6 inches), were\r\nhighly esteemed. The Royal Observatory of Greenwich possessed, in 1765,\r\none of each class. In a comparative trial of SHORT'S telescope, at\r\nGreenwich, and one of HERSCHEL'S first telescopes, the latter was\r\nadjudged greatly superior.\r\n\r\n[32] At least _one_ of these telescopes had the principal\r\nmirror made of glass instead of metal.--_Philosophical Transactions_,\r\n1803.\r\n\r\n[33] The following extract from FOURIER'S _Éloge_ of HERSCHEL\r\nis of interest in this connection. The sum first appropriated by the\r\nking was £2,000. This was afterwards raised to £4,000, and a sum of £200\r\nyearly was given for maintenance.\r\n\r\n\"L'histoire doit conserver à jamais la réponse de ce prince à un\r\nétranger célèbre [LALANDE?] qui le remerciait des sommes considérables\r\naccordées pour les progrès de l'astronomie. 'Je fais les dépenses de la\r\nguerre,' dit le roi, 'parcequ'elles sont nécessaires; quant à celles des\r\nsciences, il m'est agréable des les ordonner; leur objet ne coûte point\r\ndes larmes, et honore l'humanité.'\"\r\n\r\nLALANDE'S own account is a little different. He says the king exclaimed:\r\n\"Ne vaut-il pas mieux employer son argent à cela qu'à faire tuer des\r\nhommes?\"\r\n\r\n[34] The memoirs on the parallaxes of stars, written by various\r\nastronomers from 1750 to 1800, were mainly directed to the improvement\r\nof the methods, or to the discovery of the parallax of some particular\r\nstar. For example, LACAILLE'S observations of _Sirius_, at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, had resulted in a parallax of 9\" for that star--a\r\nquantity over forty times too large.\r\n\r\n[35] HERSCHEL accepted, as did all his cotemporaries, the\r\nNewtonian or corpuscular theory of light.\r\n\r\n[36] Thus the position of small stars critically situated in\r\nthe centre, or on the edges of the nebulæ was always noted. Many of the\r\ndescriptions are given in the published papers, but the publication of\r\nthe diagrams would be an immense help to this branch of astronomy.\r\nD'ARREST in his reduction of HERSCHEL'S nebula observations (1856)\r\nwrites: \"Gewiss wäre es vom höchsten Interesse für die Entwickelung,\r\nwelche hoffentlich auch dieser Zweig der beobachtenden Astronomie\r\nzukünftig erhalten wird, wenn die HERSCHEL'Schen Beobachtungen in der\r\nAusführlichkeit in welcher sie, verschiedenen Andeutungen zufolge,\r\n_handschriftlich_ vorhanden sind, veröffentlicht würden. Es schliesst\r\nsich dieser Wunsch in Betreff der Nebelflecken lebhaft an den an,\r\nwelcher, schon vor einem Jahrzehnt nach Veröffentlichung der 400 noch\r\nunedirten _star-gauges_ von gewichtigerer Seite her geäussert wurde.\"\r\nIn this all must agree who have a knowledge of the direction in which we\r\nmust look for advances in the difficult and important questions of the\r\ndistance, the motions, and the changes of the nebulæ. Almost the only\r\naid to be looked for from the older observations must come from such\r\ndiagrams, and we may safely say that the publication of this priceless\r\nmaterial, just as it stands, would carry our exact data back from 1833\r\nto 1786, or no less than forty-seven years.\r\n\r\n[37] Long after HERSCHEL had abandoned this idea, it continued\r\ncurrent among astronomers. The successes of Lord ROSSE'S telescope\r\nperpetuated to the middle of the nineteenth century an erroneous view\r\nwhich HERSCHEL had given up in 1791.\r\n\r\n[38] These have never been re-observed. They should be sought\r\nfor with a powerful refractor, taking special precautions against the\r\nillumination of the field of view from neighboring bright stars.\r\nHERSCHEL'S reflectors were specially open to illusions produced in this\r\nway. His observations probably will remain untested until some large\r\ntelescope is used in the way he adopted, _i. e._, in sweeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--LIST OF THE PUBLISHED WRITINGS OF WILLIAM HERSCHEL ON ASTRONOMICAL\r\n    SUBJECTS.\r\n\r\n                       [In chronological order.]\r\n\r\n_N.B.--In general, translations and abstracts of those which appeared\r\nin periodicals are not noticed here.
