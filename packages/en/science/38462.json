E.), appear to have been Arabian traders, who, on\r\ntheir voyages to Southern China, landed on these islands, then known as\r\nMegabalu and Legabalu, on the first occasion in 851, and on the second in\r\n877 of the Christian era. Abu-Zeyd-Hassan, one of these adventurers, gave\r\na circumstantial account of these voyages, which has been translated into\r\nFrench, and published by Eusebius Renaudot.[1]\r\n\r\nAfter the Cape of Good Hope was doubled in 1497, the Nicobars were chiefly\r\nfrequented by voyagers in East Indian seas, but without any such visits\r\nhaving in the least contributed to enlarge our information respecting a\r\ngroup so important by geographical position.\r\n\r\nIn 1602, Captain Lancaster, commander of an English ship, passed ten days\r\non the Nicobars, during which he hardly visited the southern islands,\r\nGreat and Little Nicobar, but kept to the small island of Sombrero, of the\r\nnorthern cluster, now called Bampoka. He there found trees of such\r\ncircumference and height, as would serve for the construction of the\r\nlargest ships. Towards the middle of the seventeenth century, Koeping, a\r\nSwede, made his appearance at the Nicobars. Happening to be on board a\r\nDutch vessel, which touched in 1647 at one of the islands, he thought he\r\nperceived among the inhabitants certain men furnished with caudal\r\nappendages, whereas it was their peculiar clothing, which consists of a\r\nlong narrow piece of woven stuff, wound round the body and then left to\r\nhang loosely, which gave rise to such a report. With the arrival in Indian\r\nwaters of Dampier, that daring but most trustworthy of navigators, the\r\ninformation respecting these islands first becomes more definite. He\r\nlanded in the north-western Bay of the largest of these, to which he\r\nassigned the latitude 7 deg. 30' N., and gave a most extensive narrative of\r\nhis adventurous career from the moment he abandoned the corsair-craft he\r\nhad brought from Europe to seek for assistance on the Nicobars, to the\r\nperiod when, after braving a tremendous storm in a canoe, along with seven\r\nof his companions in misfortune he landed half dead on the northernmost\r\npoint of Sumatra about 1706.\r\n\r\nIn 1708, Captain Owen, another English shipmaster, paid an involuntary\r\nvisit to this Archipelago, his ship having been stranded on the\r\nuninhabited island of Tillangschong, whence he escaped with his crew to\r\nthe islands Ning and Souri, only four miles to the westward, apparently\r\nwhat is now known as Nangkauri. For the first time history now records an\r\noutrage of which the natives were guilty towards the strangers.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the captain, after having experienced an exceedingly\r\nfriendly reception, laid down his knife, upon which one of the islanders,\r\nvery possibly out of curiosity, laid hold of it, pushed the owner aside,\r\nand ultimately possessed himself of the knife. On the following day, as\r\nOwen was taking his mid-day meal under a tree, he was set upon and killed\r\nby several of the natives, who shot him down with their arrows; on the\r\nother hand the crew, consisting of sixteen persons, were furnished with\r\ncanoes and provisions, so that without experiencing any further\r\nill-treatment they were so fortunate as to reach Junkseilan.\r\n\r\nThe first essay towards a settlement of the Nicobar Islands was made by\r\nthe Jesuits in 1711, upon the most northerly island of the group,\r\nKar-Nicobar. They succumbed however to the noxious influences of the\r\nclimate, and the few neophytes speedily sank back into heathendom.\r\n\r\nThe second attempt at colonization by Europeans took place in 1756, when\r\nLieutenant Tanck, a Dane, after taking possession of the entire group in\r\nthe name of his sovereign, the King of Denmark, named the islands\r\n\"_Frederiks Oerne_\" (Frederick Islands), and founded the first colony on\r\nthe northern side of Great Nicobar, or Sambellong. In the year 1760 this\r\nwas transferred by the followers of Tanck to the island of Kamorta, but\r\nhere too after a short time the experiment failed, owing to the\r\nunhealthiness of the climate.\r\n\r\nIn 1766, fourteen Moravian Brethren were settled on Nangkauri, with the\r\nview of extending the influence of the Danish East India Company. The want\r\nof information respecting the necessary conditions under which this colony\r\nwas called into existence, was in all probability the cause of its speedy\r\ndeclension. Within less than two decades the majority of these settlers\r\nhad fallen under the baneful influence of the climate.\r\n\r\nOn 1st April, 1778, the Austrian vessel _Joseph and Theresa_, commanded\r\nby Captain Bennet, landed on the N.E. side of Kar-Nicobar, or New Denmark.\r\nThis vessel had been commissioned by the Imperial Government to select, in\r\nthe name of H.M. Joseph II., Austrian plantations and commercial stations\r\non the farther side of the Cape of Good Hope. Of this remarkable\r\nexpedition nothing more has been handed down to us than is related by\r\nexcellent Nicolas Fontana, who accompanied the expedition as surgeon, in\r\nhis book of travels, which was published at Leipzig in 1782.[2]\r\n\r\nNeither the libraries nor the archives of the empire seem capable of\r\nfurnishing more definite information respecting this interesting\r\nundertaking. However, on the other hand, through the kind offices of\r\nH.I.H. the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian with the Government of H.M. the\r\nKing of the Belgians, there have been found in the Royal Archives at\r\nBrussels several highly important documents, bearing upon this expedition,\r\nof which M. Gachard, keeper of the State Archives in that country, had the\r\nkindness to furnish us with copies; and while we propose in the following\r\nremarks to avail ourselves of the most interesting data, the more\r\nparticular consideration of this circumstance, so interesting in the\r\nhistory of the development of our trade, will be deferred till the\r\nappearance of the commercial section of the Novara publications.\r\n\r\nA Dutchman, named William Bolts, formerly in the service of the British\r\nEast India Company, in the year 1774 made to Count Belgiojoso, at that\r\nperiod Ambassador in London of the Empress Maria Theresa, proposals for\r\ndirect commercial intercourse between the Netherlands and Trieste and\r\nPersia, the East Indies, China, and Africa, with the object of supplying\r\nthe harbours of the Austrian dominions with the products of India and\r\nChina, without the costly intervention of other countries. This\r\nproposition having been brought under the notice of the Imperial\r\nChancellor, Prince Kaunitz, at Vienna, was so cordially received by that\r\nminister, that Bolts received an invitation to present himself at the\r\nEmpress's palace, in order to develope his plans more fully in person in\r\nthat august presence. Bolts arrived in Vienna in April, 1775, and very\r\nshortly afterwards was invested by the Empress with all the requisite\r\nprivileges for facilitating the prosecution of his great project. The\r\nimperial officials at Trieste were entrusted with the equipment and arming\r\nof the vessel, the supreme military council were required to provide the\r\nnecessary pay for the soldiers and subaltern officers, and Bolts by\r\nspecial commission was formally empowered in the name of the Empress\r\nQueen, as also in that of her successors upon the throne, to take\r\npossession of all the territories which he might succeed in getting ceded\r\nby the princes of India, for the behoof of such of Her Imperial Majesty's\r\nsubjects as should purpose trading with the Indies.\r\n\r\nIt was the wish of the Government that the first expedition should take\r\nits departure from Trieste; Bolts however opposed this, for the reason\r\nthat his vessel must take part of its lading from London, but declared\r\nhimself prepared to make the most strenuous efforts to found a mercantile\r\nhouse in Trieste, and to take such precautions as should result in the\r\nsecond and all future expeditions being dispatched from Trieste.\r\n\r\nBolts hereupon first proceeded to Amsterdam with his newly acquired\r\nprivileges, and thence to London, as yet without being more fortunate in\r\nhis attempt to set on foot the proposed association in the one locality\r\nthan in the other. At last, at Antwerp in the Netherlands, he succeeded in\r\ninteresting in his project a certain Baron von Proli, and two merchants,\r\nby the name of Borrekens and Naegeles, and with these three persons he\r\nentered into a contract of association, on 20th Sept. 1775. At the same\r\ntime a fund of L90,000 was raised for the armament of a second trading\r\nvessel to the East Indies and China, and out of the same amount to\r\nestablish a mercantile house in Trieste.\r\n\r\nIn possession of L25,000 sterling, which he had procured from his\r\nassociates, Bolts proceeded to London, where he purchased a vessel, which\r\nhe named the _Joseph and Theresa_, put a portion of her cargo on board,\r\nand on 14th March, 1776, set sail thence for Leghorn. Here certain\r\narticles were to be taken on board, which the Government had promised to\r\nhave ready, and which consisted of copper, iron, steel, and tools. Before\r\nBolts left harbour on his voyage to the Indies he was invested by the\r\nEmpress with the grade of Lieutenant-Colonel in their service, and for the\r\nbetter prosecution of his objects was provided by the State Chancery with\r\ncomprehensive powers,[3] and a pass for barbarous countries, called a\r\n\"_Scontrino_.\"[4] The Empress at the same time provided the daring\r\nadventurer with letters of introduction under her own hand to the Emperor\r\nof China, the \"King\" of Persia, and the Indian satraps whose dominions he\r\nwas to visit.\r\n\r\nBaron Proli, one of the chief partners, went first of all to Vienna, and\r\nthence to Leghorn, and concluded an agreement with Bolts to dispatch a\r\nship to the Indies in each of the years 1777, 1778, 1779, the cargoes of\r\nwhich should be worth at least L30,000 each, while Bolts, on his part,\r\nengaged to remain in the Indies three and a half years from the day of his\r\ndeparture, there to found factories, and to lay out to the best advantage\r\nthe money realized by the sale of the merchandise consigned to him. The\r\nEmpress Maria Theresa rewarded Proli for services already rendered, as\r\nalso for those which he undertook to perform in the establishment of\r\ntrading-exchanges in Trieste and Bruges, for the support of the oversea\r\ncommerce of the Austrian and Belgian provinces, by raising him to the\r\ndignity of Count.\r\n\r\nThe ship _Joseph and Theresa_, bound for the east coast of Africa, as also\r\nfor the shores of Malabar, Coromandel, and Bengal, set sail from Leghorn\r\nin September, 1776, with a crew of 155 men. Unfavourable winds compelled\r\nBolts to make the Brazilian coast, in order to take in fresh stores.\r\nThence he lay a course for Delagoa Bay, on the S.E. coast of Africa,\r\nopposite the island of Madagascar, on which, on 30th March, 1777, he was\r\nso unfortunate as to get stranded, when he was compelled to start a\r\nportion of his cargo overboard. Bolts, however, turned to excellent\r\naccount his stay on this coast, having purchased from two African kings,\r\nnamed Mohaar Capell, and Chibauraan Matola, a site of ground on both banks\r\nof the river Masoumo, and, at a total expenditure of 126,267 florins\r\n(about L12,600), in which was included the cost of constructing the\r\nnecessary vessels, founded a factory, for whose protection he also erected\r\ntwo small forts, which he furnished with cannon, and named after his two\r\nillustrious patrons, Joseph and Theresa.\r\n\r\nAfter a more protracted stay on the coast of Malabar, where he purchased\r\nfrom the Nabob, the celebrated Hyder Ali Khan, a number of plots of\r\nground in the vicinity of Mangalore, Carwar, and Balliapatam, the very\r\ncentre of the pepper trade, and erected a factory at an expense of 28,074\r\nflorins (L2800), this enterprising man set sail for the Coromandel Coast\r\nand the Bay of Bengal, and about the commencement of 1778 visited the\r\nNicobar Islands, in order there also to found a factory. Unfortunately, of\r\nthis visit there nowhere survive any detailed particulars, and the only\r\ndocument extant under Bolts' hand, which can throw any light on the\r\nsubject, is a statement of the expenditure incurred in erecting a fort on\r\nthe Nicobars, which, together with the purchase of a _goelette_, and a\r\nsnow, or two-masted vessel, for the coasting trade between Madras, Pegu,\r\nand the group of islands, amounted to 47,659 fl. 48 kr. (about L4760).\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1780 Bolts returned to Europe, and in May, 1781, cast\r\nanchor in the harbour of Leghorn. His exertions and his speculation had\r\nnot been attended with the success anticipated, and despite fresh\r\nassistance afforded by the Austrian Government to the Association, which\r\nat first seemed to promise a more auspicious future for the undertaking,\r\nyet the political complications of the period, and especially the sudden,\r\ntotally unlooked-for rupture of peace between France, England, and\r\nHolland, ere long entailed utter ruin on the trading company, which, in\r\nthe year 1785, found itself compelled to stop payment.[5] Bolts died at\r\nParis in April, 1808, in utter destitution, and Michaud, in his\r\n_Biographie Universelle_, dedicated an article to this hardy and\r\nenterprising, rather than shrewd and prudent, adventurer.[6]\r\n\r\nAbout two years after the appearance of the Austrian ship in the Nicobar\r\nArchipelago, the Danes endeavoured to found there a missionary station of\r\nMoravian Brothers. Towards the close of 1778 the missionaries, Haensel and\r\nWangemann, sailed from Tranquebar to Nangkauri, where they arrived in\r\nJanuary, 1779. In 1787 the mission at Nangkauri was once more abandoned,\r\nwhen the only surviving Moravian Brother returned to Tranquebar, and\r\nshortly after to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 an Englishman, Major Symes, touched at Kar-Nicobar, while on his\r\nvoyage as Envoy to Ava and Burmah. His observations there may be found in\r\nthe second volume of \"Asiatic Researches,\" p. 344, in an article entitled\r\n\"Description of Carnicobar.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1831, Denmark once more made an attempt to colonize, by means of a\r\nmissionary enterprise, the group formerly known as New Denmark, and\r\noccasionally as Frederick Islands. Pastor Rosen landed in August of that\r\nyear on the island of Kamorta, and first set up his establishment on the\r\nso-called Frederick Hill, then on the adjoining Mongkata Hill; somewhat\r\nlater on the island of Trinkut, and lastly on the shore immediately\r\nbeneath the Mongkata Hill. In December, 1834, after about a four years'\r\nstay, Pastor Rosen left the islands, and in 1839 published, at Copenhagen,\r\nhis own experiences and personal observations, under the title:\r\n\"_Erindringen om mit Ophold paa de Nikobariske Oerne_\" (Recollections of\r\nmy Residence on the Nicobar Islands).\r\n\r\nIn 1835, the Roman Catholic Bishop of the Straits of Malacca dispatched to\r\nKar-Nicobar two French missionaries, the Fathers Chopard and Borie. But\r\nafter a certain lapse of time, during which their missionary efforts gave\r\npromise of the most pleasing results, and when they had lived about a year\r\non the island, the pious work fell through, owing to the credulity and\r\nprejudices of the natives, to whom the two missionaries were represented\r\nby the crew of a ship from the adjacent shores of the continent as English\r\nspies, whose object probably was to ascertain the products of the country,\r\nwhich thereupon would speedily be annexed by the English Government. The\r\nmissionaries had to flee, and Borie expired in the arms of his companion\r\nbefore he could get off the island. Chopard afterwards, in the year 1849,\r\npublished his adventures in this group of islands in the \"Asiatic Journal\r\nof the Indian Archipelago,\" under the title, \"_A few Particulars\r\nrespecting the Nicobar Islands._\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1845, Mr. Mackey, Danish Consul in Calcutta, set on foot a\r\nsmall expedition to the Nicobar Archipelago. That gentleman hoped to find\r\namongst the southern islands strata of coal, and made a voyage thither in\r\nprosecution of that object, on board the schooner _Espiegle_, commanded by\r\nan Englishman named Lewis, and accompanied by two Danes, Mr. Busch, the\r\nsole commander of the expedition, and a certain Mr. Lowert. By the end of\r\nMay the adventurers were once more in Calcutta. With the exception of a\r\nfew lumps they had not found coal-beds on any part of the island, while\r\nthey lacked the physical strength requisite for founding the agricultural\r\ncolony, which it had been intended to set on foot at the same time. The\r\nscientific results of this voyage are comprised in a small _brochure_, \"H.\r\nBusch's Journal of a Cruise amongst the Nicobar Islands,\" (Calcutta,\r\n1845).\r\n\r\nA further scientific exploration of the Nicobar group was made by the\r\nnaturalists attached to the Danish corvette _Galatea_ in the course of\r\ntheir voyage round the world in the years 1845-7. A thorough examination\r\nof the Nicobars was one of the chief objects of the expedition set on foot\r\nunder the auspices of the Danish Government. On the 25th January, 1846, at\r\nNangkauri, Captain Steen Bille took formal possession of this group of\r\nislands in the name of H.M. the King of Denmark. Two natives, father and\r\nson, named respectively Luha and Angre, the former resident in Malacca,\r\nand the latter in Enuang, were on that occasion installed as chief\r\nmagistrates; each being at the same time provided with a staff bearing the\r\ncypher of Christian VIII., and instructed, by means of a document drawn\r\nup in the English and Danish languages, on the subject of their duties,\r\nwhich consisted principally in hoisting the Danish Standard on the arrival\r\nof foreign ships in the harbour of Nangkauri.[7]\r\n\r\nAfter the decease of Christian VIII., the Danish Government, in\r\nconsequence of the violent political agitations of the period, did not\r\nshow itself disposed to make practical use of their possession of the\r\nNicobar Islands by any lasting colonization, but on the contrary in the\r\nyear 1848 dispatched the royal corvette _Valkyrien_ to the Archipelago, to\r\nbring away the flag and batons.[8]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, according to \"Thornton's Gazetteer of India,\" the\r\nchiefs of the island of Kar-Nicobar hoisted the English flag, and through\r\ncertain English merchants resident in Moulmein, expressed a wish to be\r\npermitted to place themselves under the protection of the British Crown.\r\nThis information, however, seems to be inaccurate, in so far as it\r\nprofesses to describe the conduct of the native chiefs. The inhabitants,\r\nit is true, hoist any flag given to them, because they are fond of\r\nimitating European customs, and by so doing believe they secure themselves\r\nagainst the pretensions of other nations; but there is nothing they so\r\nmuch dread as a regular occupation of the islands, and on every appearance\r\nof a war-ship are forthwith filled with alarm lest they should be about to\r\nbe deprived of their liberty, and--their cocoa-nuts. Indeed they have a\r\nsaying widely diffused among them, probably through the craft of some\r\nsmart chiefs, that whenever a European should settle among them all the\r\ncocoa-nuts will drop from the trees, and they will thus see themselves\r\ndeprived for ever of their most important means of subsistence. It is, on\r\nthe contrary, more probable that the English ship captains, who trade with\r\nthese islands in order the better to secure their highly profitable trade\r\nin cocoa-nuts, made some propositions to the East Indian Government to\r\ntake possession of this important group, by a similar procedure as that by\r\nwhich the Andaman islands were annexed somewhat later.\r\n\r\nSince the unsuccessful attempt at the end of last century to extend\r\nAustrian commerce with the Indies and the coast of Africa, by founding a\r\nfew colonies in those places, no vessel sailing under the Austrian flag\r\nhad again visited the Nicobar Islands, and accordingly, on the dispatch of\r\nan Imperial ship-of-war to those waters, it was naturally wished that she\r\nshould on her voyage to China visit this group, on whose shores the\r\nAustrian flag had once been unfurled as a symbol of possession. On this\r\noccasion, however, the object was rather scientific than political. It was\r\nintended, so far as the time allotted for visiting these islands and the\r\nappliances at hand admitted, to undertake inquiries as to the most\r\nimportant geodetical points, together with astronomical, magnetic, and\r\nmeteorological observations, and at the same time to make investigations\r\nand collections of the various objects of natural science, and thus to\r\ncomplete as it were the valuable labours carried out in 1846 by the Danish\r\nExpedition to the Nicobar Islands. The following pages are simply limited\r\nto giving a popular narrative of our own stay on this interesting island\r\ngroup, while more circumstantial information of the various scientific\r\nresults obtained there will be deferred till the appearance of the special\r\nworks being drawn up by the members, each in his own special section.\r\n\r\nOn 25th February, at 10 A.M., the naturalists, accompanied by the officers\r\nin charge of the scientific apparatus, and the midshipmen, after very\r\nconsiderable difficulty, succeeded in effecting a landing on the island of\r\nKar-Nicobar, in a bay protected by a coral reef (by observation 9 deg. 14' 8''\r\nN., and 92 deg. 44' 46'' E.), between the villages of Moose and Saoui. At this\r\npoint the surf beats incessantly over the huge reefs of coral upon a waste\r\nof gleaming white sand, which stretches in graceful curves from one point\r\nof rock to that next adjoining. The few fruits which have been thrown up,\r\nor been carried hither, probably from some distant shore, have struck root\r\nin this coral sand, and a coronal of luxuriant palms, with their slim\r\nstems, and loaded with thousands of nuts, serves as food for man.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the spot where we disembarked was anchored a barque\r\nfrom Moulmein, with a Malay crew, the majority of whom were tattooed on\r\nthe thigh with extraordinary skill. They had been for a considerable\r\nperiod taking in a cargo of cocoa-nuts, which the natives had been\r\nexchanging against various merchandise. About thirty dusky natives, almost\r\nentirely naked, and for the most part without any head covering beyond the\r\nsplendid raven locks which hung down over their shoulders, some carrying\r\nin their hands cutlasses, others long wooden lances tipped with bone,\r\nstood near the beach, and while we were yet a little distance off, called\r\nout to us in broken English, and with visible anxiety, \"Good friend? No\r\nfear!\" apparently anxious, in the first place, to have confirmation from\r\nus that we were really \"good friends,\" and that they had nothing to dread,\r\nbefore they ventured quite close to us. When they were no more than twenty\r\npaces distant, they suddenly came to a halt, upon which some of their\r\nnumber, who appeared to be chiefs, gave their spears and cutlasses to\r\nthose around, and advanced to us with a tolerably friendly air, at the\r\nsame time stretching out their hands by way of salutation. They were for\r\nthe most part large, well-proportioned men, of a dark bronze colour of\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThe most disagreeable feature is the mouth, which, in consequence of the\r\nloathsome custom of incessantly chewing the betel-nut, seems to have\r\nbecome utterly distorted in shape. In a few cases this filthy habit had\r\nresulted in such deformity among the teeth, that these were barely visible\r\nbetween the thick swollen lips, like a malignant tumour! The apparel of\r\nthe natives is pretty universally entirely primitive, consisting of\r\nnothing but a long very narrow strip of dark blue linen, which they wind\r\nround the body, bringing it from the front between the legs backwards,\r\nwhen it is made fast to the girdle, and the ends left to hang loosely\r\ndown. Some of the natives make a very singular use of the different\r\narticles of old clothes which they receive in exchange from the ship\r\ncaptains, or have had given as a present, as they appear now in a black\r\nhat, now in a coat or a shirt, without a vestige of other clothing!\r\n\r\nAlmost every native we saw brought to us a soiled, crumpled-up\r\ntestimonial, setting forth his good character, and his honesty in the\r\ncocoa-nut trade, which he had received from various ship captains, who\r\nbartered their merchandise for ripe cocoa-nuts, which they afterwards sold\r\nin the East Indies or Ceylon at an immense profit. The greater number of\r\nthese testimonials were written in English; we found only one in German\r\nfrom the skipper of a Bremen ship, and one in Dutch. In these certificates\r\nare set forth the objects best worth enquiring for, as also a statement of\r\nthe articles bartered in the course of exchange for cocoa-nuts, a practice\r\nwhich is not alone of the utmost utility for those who may afterwards\r\nvisit the islands for purposes of commerce, but also throw a most\r\ninteresting light upon the evidences of civilization among the natives.[9]\r\n\r\nThese testimonials also frequently contain very humorous remarks about the\r\nunsuspecting natives, who assuredly would be less eager in producing them\r\nif they were acquainted with the contents. One of the earliest to extend\r\nto us the hand of welcome was a native who called himself Captain Dickson,\r\na handsome, slim, dark brown figure, with very long, fine, glossy hair\r\nhanging over his shoulders, and neatly gathered together with a bark\r\nribbon. In the document presented to us, which was dated 15th January,\r\nand bore the signature of the captain of the ship _Arracan_, there was\r\nwritten beneath, \"Dickson, though a shabby-looking fellow, is a man of\r\nsubstance.\" In a second testimonial, it was said of a native: \"He will do\r\nhonour to England when she comes!\" a remark which leaves plainly apparent\r\nthe hope of the ship captain that these islands will speedily be occupied\r\nby the English. These certificates likewise contain a variety of important\r\nhints, especially with reference to the method of dealing with the\r\nnatives, the most commodious anchorage, the difficulty encountered in\r\nlanding, &c.[10]\r\n\r\nThus the most cursory communication with the natives convinced us that\r\nthey must already have repeatedly done business with English ship\r\ncaptains, who had imparted to them a slight knowledge of the English\r\nlanguage, and a few of the simpler principles of humanity and religion.\r\nWhen we gave them to understand that we visited them as friends, they\r\nreplied in their broken English: \"Not merely friends--brothers! all\r\nbrothers! all only one father and one mother!\" Hereupon each proceeded to\r\nlight one of the cigars that had been presented to them, while, for want\r\nof any other receptacle, they secreted the remainder in the wide holes\r\ntranspiercing the lobes of the ears, after which they with the most frank\r\nmunificence, and in token of their hospitality, pulled a number of young\r\ncocoa-nuts from the tree, and gave us their fluid contents to drink. Very\r\nsingular was the method in which this was effected. They tie their feet\r\ntogether by the ankles with a loop of the same bast, or bark rope, which,\r\nwhen employed in fastening their long black locks, usually forms such a\r\npicturesque frontlet, and then clamber with the agility of cats to the\r\nsummit of the palm, throw to the bottom the separated fruit, and slide\r\nswiftly down to the ground again. Holding in one hand a tolerably heavy\r\nyoung nut, in the other a sharp cutlass, they proceed at one sure blow to\r\nopen the nut, in such manner that a small orifice is made, through which\r\nthe refreshing liquid contents can be conveniently quaffed. When this has\r\nbeen evacuated the nut is usually split in half, in which form it serves\r\nas a most nutritious food for the fowls and hogs. Despite their\r\nhospitality, there was perceptible in all of them great anxiety, and the\r\nupshot of all their conversation always resolved itself into the\r\nstereotyped questions, \"What did we really require? whether we wished to\r\npurchase cocoa-nuts, and would soon be leaving?\"\r\n\r\nGreat and natural as our desire was to penetrate from the shore, thickly\r\ncovered with its belt of cocoa-nut palms, into the rather flat interior,\r\nand thus obtain a nearer view of the hive-shaped, basket-formed huts which\r\nwere visible under the forest trees, we judged it much the better course\r\nto endeavour first of all to make the natives more confiding, and for that\r\npurpose invited them to accompany us on board. Eight of their number were\r\nfinally induced to follow us, and came alongside in their elegant canoes,\r\nformed of the wood of the _Calophyllum inophyllum_, one of the most\r\nsplendid trees of the primeval forest of the islands. As soon as we\r\nreached the frigate, only a single one, Captain Dickson, could be induced\r\nto clamber up of the man-ropes; the rest did not venture to leave their\r\ncanoes, and one, who called himself Captain Charlie, a short, lank little\r\nfellow of boyish appearance, who for all apparel wore a dirty cloth cap on\r\nhis head, trembled with terror through his whole frame when he saw our big\r\nguns. Captain Dickson, too, did not seem to feel himself altogether\r\ncomfortable while on board, and although there was much to excite his\r\ncuriosity, he soon longed to get out of the large ship, back again into\r\nhis own frail skiff. Quite peculiar was the impression made upon him by a\r\npair of live cows; such large animals he gave us to understand were not\r\nfound upon his island.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a number of natives had approached the frigate in their canoes,\r\nbringing swine, fowls, plantains, yams, and eggs in hollowed-out cocoa-nut\r\nshells, which they offered as presents, but at the same time inquired what\r\nwe intended giving them in return. They greatly wished for biscuit,\r\nbrandy, medicines, clothes, but above all else for black hats, which most\r\nprobably results from their having occasionally seen the captains of\r\nEnglish ships wearing round hats, whence they now seem to imagine that\r\nsuch a head-gear is the insignia of captain's rank, or of a chief.\r\n\r\nTheir knowledge of money was confined to Rupees, which they discriminated\r\ninto two sorts, viz. the ordinary East Indian coin, and the English\r\nsixpenny-piece, which they called \"small Rupees,\" covering with them, by\r\nway of ornament, the ends of the small bits of bamboo which they usually\r\nwear through the hole that transpierces the greatly distended lobe of the\r\near.\r\n\r\nOf the two Catholic missionaries, Borie and Chopard, who in 1835 had\r\nremained a short time on the island, not one of the natives could give us\r\nany particulars; and likewise of the Danish corvette _Galatea_, which\r\nvisited the group in 1846, they had but a dim remembrance, and even this\r\nof a far from complimentary character; the poor people having been\r\noverwhelmed with the apprehensions that their island was about to be taken\r\npossession of, and themselves exposed to a lingering death by hunger.\r\n\"Danish bad people,\" they exclaimed, \"wanted to take our island. Suppose I\r\ncould come to your island and take it? Not good! no good people!\"\r\n\r\nWe returned on shore with the natives, who, in consequence of their\r\nfriendly reception on board, had already become somewhat more tranquil and\r\ntrustful. Tents were now pitched, the astronomical and geodetical\r\ninstruments, together with the barometer and thermometer, were adjusted,\r\nthe tide-gauge fixed at the most suitable point, and the island traversed\r\nin all directions for scientific purposes, so far at least as the density\r\nof the forest and the mistrust of the natives would permit.\r\n\r\nOn the very same day we visited the Cove of Saoui, on which is situated\r\nthe village of the same name, whose chief is called \"Captain John.\" This\r\nworthy had received by way of present an old cast-off blue uniform frock,\r\nand was now making strenuous exertions to squeeze his all too little\r\nflexible limbs into this tight thick cloth coat, and to button it, despite\r\nthe tropical heat, round his naked body up to the very throat. He was\r\nanxious it should not be reported of him that he did not sufficiently\r\nvalue the distinction awarded him, or did not comprehend how to make a\r\nproper use of it. Unlike the rest of his compatriots, Captain John also\r\nwore shoes and pants, and in consequence openly claimed to belong to the\r\nprivileged classes. He was surrounded by a considerable number of natives,\r\nwho presented themselves to us, as Captain Morgan, Captain Douglas, Dr.\r\nCrisp, Lord Nelson, Lord Byron, Lord Wellington, and so forth, having been\r\nindebted to the singular whimsies of some English captains, who thought it\r\na good joke to confer on these filthy brown people the illustrious names\r\nof the hereditary and intellectual aristocracy of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nCaptain John accompanied us along the coast to his own domicile by an\r\nexceedingly difficult and sunny path, having designedly concealed from us\r\nthe existence of a much more commodious track through the forest to the\r\nvillage, which contains only seven houses. These are erected in a broad\r\nopen space, and in consequence of the great humidity of the soil during\r\nthe wet season, consist of eight or ten poles, from six to eight feet in\r\nheight, so that a man can easily pass under them. They comprise but one\r\nlarge apartment, into which access is obtained by a neatly-carved ladder\r\nof bamboo-reed, which during the night, or when the occupants leave the\r\nhut, is usually taken away, so that, without using locks or bolts, it is\r\npretty difficult to get in. The flooring is constructed of bamboo planks,\r\nbound together with Rotang (_Calamus Rotang_), in such a manner that the\r\nair from beneath can circulate freely through, and, in a similar way, the\r\nneat basket-work of the hive-shaped structure is vaulted. A dense straw\r\nthatch serves as well to keep out the sun's rays as the rain. The internal\r\narrangements are very simple. In the rear is a sort of fire-place, a low\r\nblock of wood hollowed out, and the cavity filled with sand and stones,\r\nupon which is placed a variety of utensils of clay, imported from the\r\nadjoining island of Chowry, the only island of the entire Archipelago\r\nwhere any industry is carried on. From the beams of the roof are suspended\r\nhollowed-out cocoa-nuts, strung together in pairs, and serving as water\r\njars, as also elegantly plaited baskets and the few possessions of the\r\nfamily, and, lastly, some fruits, betel-leaves, and tobacco, as offerings\r\nto the Eewees, or evil spirits, in the event of their paying a visit, and\r\nhaving an appetite for such fare. Further forward, opposite the entrance\r\nof the hut, there are stuck on the side walls, as evidences of special\r\nprosperity, numerous cutlasses, spears, javelins, and paddles. Besides,\r\nthere are laid on the floor plaited straw-mats, which, rolled up during\r\nthe day, are stretched out at night and, together with a small wooden\r\nstool for a pillow, serve as couches on which to repose. The hut might\r\nfurnish sleeping quarters for about ten men. As, moreover, all the cookery\r\nis carried on therein, and there is no means of ventilating from above,\r\nthe interior is completely saturated with smoke, and all articles are soon\r\nbegrimed with smoke and soot. The natives, however, apparently take no\r\nprecautions to get rid of the smoke, because it contributes to keep them\r\nfree of a far more subtle foe, the mosquito, who, especially during the\r\nrainy season, becomes a formidable torment for their naked bodies.\r\n\r\nIn the shady space beneath the hut, which sometimes serves as a\r\nworkshop,--if one may venture so to designate the industry of the\r\ninhabitants of the Nicobars generally,--Captain John had suspended upon a\r\ntransverse beam a sort of swing, in which he occasionally rocked himself,\r\nmuch to his own delight, while for his guests was provided a wooden\r\narm-chair, which had evidently come into his possession in the course of\r\nsome barter with the captain of a merchant vessel.\r\n\r\nThe old chief spoke with marked predilection of the captain of the barque\r\n_Rochester_ of London, a gentleman named Green, who, by his humane and\r\nstrictly conscientious dealings with the natives, seemed to stand in high\r\nrespect, and afforded a striking example of what beneficial influence is\r\nexercised by individual English ship captains over the wild races with\r\nwhom they come in contact in the way of trade, and how much they have it\r\nin their power to make their nation respected in all parts of the globe.\r\nWe venture to assert that these English merchantmen, during their cursory\r\nvisits, have done more towards paving the way for civilizing the Nicobars\r\nthan the Danish and French missionaries during their residence of years.\r\nNot a single native understands one word of Danish or French, but almost\r\nevery one speaks English, sufficient, at all events, to make himself\r\nunderstood in that language. The talkative old fellow next held forth an\r\nEnglish Bible, which had been carefully stowed away on one of the\r\ncross-beams of his hut, and of which, as he told us, he had been made a\r\npresent by Captain Green, on that gentleman's last visit. \"This is my\r\nJesus Christ,\" said Captain John, full of unquestioning faith in the\r\nmarvellous power of Holy Writ:--\"when I feel ill, I lay this little book\r\nunder my head, and I get well again!\" The worthy fellow could neither read\r\nnor, so far as we could perceive, did he precisely comprehend what was\r\nprinted in the book, yet he seemed instinctively to feel that it was of no\r\nordinary purport, and accordingly held his present in high honour, as a\r\nsort of talisman, whose power and efficacy one might confide in, without\r\nhis being able precisely to account for such a belief. We turned over the\r\nleaves of the little volume, which had been issued by the renowned,\r\nwide-spread, and beneficent London Bible Society, and found on the\r\nfly-leaf some English verses in Green's handwriting, and some encomiums\r\nupon the inhabitants of Kar-Nicobar, \"The most virtuous people that\r\nCaptain Green had fallen in with during eight and thirty years'\r\nsea-faring;\" closing with the remark, \"What a pity they have no\r\nmissionary!\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, the inhabitants of Kar-Nicobar are among the most perfect of\r\nhuman-kind. In their commerce with us they showed themselves to be\r\nchild-like and ignorant, yet virtuous, trustworthy people, without\r\nambition or the thirst of knowledge, but also without jealousy or envy. If\r\never any breach between themselves and the Europeans has been pushed the\r\nlength of violence, such has pretty certainly resulted rather from their\r\nbeing in a measure suddenly incited to self-defence than from any open\r\npredisposition to mischief. When we inquired of one of the natives in what\r\nmanner breach of faith is punished on the island, he replied with the\r\nutmost _naivete_;--\"We never have such--we are all good;--but in your\r\ncountry there must be many evil men, else what for would you require so\r\nmany guns?\"\r\n\r\nIn company with some of the natives we had proceeded upon a stroll through\r\nthe magnificent cocoa forest along the beach, in the course of which we\r\nreached several huts scattered at random through the thicket, the\r\ninhabitants of which received us in the most cordial manner. Their wives\r\nand children however had all retired in a body, and during our entire stay\r\nnever once made their appearance. Indeed the natives, in the hope of\r\nhastening our departure, pretended that their families had in their panic\r\nfled into the forest, and must starve of hunger if we should remain long,\r\nand so prevent them from returning to their usual abodes. This however was\r\nbut a hoax. The natives knew well enough where their families were\r\nlurking, and provided them with food and drink. This extreme shyness of\r\nthe female portion of the population arises apparently from the\r\nincivilities of which the sailors of the merchant vessels were guilty\r\ntowards the natives, whose moral feelings and delicacy of mind,\r\nconsidering their low state of civilization, becomes doubly extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to penetrate deeper into the interior of the island was baffled\r\nthrough the obstacles which are interposed by the unchecked luxuriance of\r\ntropical nature. The vegetation grows densely down to the very sea, which\r\nis separated from the rich foliage above only by rocky reefs and narrow\r\ndunes of sand, washed by the furious surf. A broad belt of _Rhizophorae_,\r\ngigantic _Barringtonias_, _Pandanus_, _Areca_, and cocoa-palms, encircles\r\nthe island, to which succeeds a somewhat higher land grown with dense\r\ngrass and interspersed with groups of trees, from which, lastly, spring a\r\nfew thickly-wooded peaks of about 150 to 200 feet in height. Through this\r\ngirdle it requires the most violent efforts to force one's way, while, on\r\nthe other hand, it is wholly impossible, owing to the dense tangle of\r\nclimbing plants and bamboo, to advance further into the forest over the\r\ngrass flat, unless a path be previously cleared with hedge-knives, which,\r\neven could more time be devoted, would call for immense exertion. Our\r\nresearches therefore were necessarily confined for the most part to the\r\ncoast region.\r\n\r\nAfter several hours of strolling about, collecting and examining as we\r\nwent on, the naturalists found themselves collected once more on the open\r\nspace facing Captain John's hut, where meanwhile a pig had been roasted by\r\nour sailors in the open air, which we had purchased for three shillings of\r\nour corpulent friend Dr. Crisp. The natives had at first protested against\r\nthis improvised hearthstone, being apprehensive lest the fire should reach\r\ntheir huts, the roofs of which are thatched with dried palm-leaves. \"It is\r\nas inflammable as gunpowder,\" remarked the old chief in an anxious tone,\r\nwhen our people had with great want of foresight lighted the fire too near\r\nthe buildings. Captain John and his kindred did not need to be invited\r\ntwice to partake of our meal, at which they proved themselves excellent\r\ntrenchermen. The inhabitants of these islands generally eat vegetables\r\nonly, the use of meat being for the most part restricted to festive\r\noccasions. The use of salt is as yet unknown to them. They only use\r\nsea-water for the purpose of seething their pigs and hens, by which\r\nprocess the flesh gets a slight flavour of salt. During our luncheon,\r\nwhich had made the natives yet more confiding than ever, we found an\r\nopportunity of hearing something about the various festivals of the\r\nNicobar islanders.\r\n\r\nWhen a native falls down from a tree, or is bitten by a snake, or is\r\notherwise wounded or dies, the Nicobarians forthwith discontinue all work,\r\nand institute a fast, which they term Uraka. With the commencement of the\r\nS.W. monsoons or rainy season (when the wind comes from \"yonder,\" quoth\r\nDr. Crisp, and pointed with his finger to the southward), the inhabitants\r\nof Kar-Nicobar hold their chief festival, which lasts fourteen days, and\r\nis called Oilere.\r\n\r\nThey have a similar festival at the end of the damp season, or N.E.\r\nmonsoon, to which the pigs, which play quite a conspicuous part in it,\r\nimpart an entirely peculiar character. Several weeks before the\r\ncommencement of this _fete_, a large number of these unclean but useful\r\nanimals are confined in small stalls, whence they are released on the\r\nfeast-day, and set loose in a well-fenced space, where they are teased and\r\npricked with lances by all the courageous, or rather mischievous, youth of\r\nthe island. The Nicobarians seem to attach special importance to the swine\r\nbeing driven wild, and themselves engaged in a regular struggle with the\r\ninfuriated animal, in the course of which severe wounds are by no means of\r\nrare occurrence. We ourselves saw several young natives, who a few days\r\npreviously had been severely injured in a similar contest with some\r\nenraged pigs. When this anything but aesthetic spectacle has lasted some\r\ntime, the pigs are killed, roasted on the fire, and devoured by the\r\ncombatants and spectators.\r\n\r\nA not less strange and even more barbarous festival is that which is held\r\nabout the same time as the one just mentioned. This consists in exhuming\r\nthe bones of all those who have died during the year elapsed since the\r\nlast N.E. monsoon, and have been interred in a sort of cemetery called\r\n\"_Cuyucupa_.\"[11] They next bring these bones into a hut, seat themselves\r\nin a circle around the ghastly mementos, and shriek and howl as at the day\r\non which the relation died. While this scene of lamentation is going on, a\r\nlighted cigar is usually stuck into the bony mouth of the grisly skull,\r\nafter which the latter is consigned to the grave again. The rest of the\r\nbones however are either thrown into the deep sea or hid far in the\r\nforest, while at the same moment, as a farther evidence of sorrow, a\r\nnumber of cocoa-palms are cut down, and their fruit scattered to the\r\nwinds. By such symbols they apparently wish to express their overwhelming\r\ngrief, their weariness of existence, and their indifference to the most\r\nvalued gifts of nature, so that they would even deprive themselves of the\r\nmost universally necessary of the means of subsistence--were it not that,\r\nowing to the readiness with which the sea-shore palm is propagated, the\r\nnuts thus scattered at random, in all the indifference to sublunary\r\nconsiderations incidental to a paroxysm of grief, speedily strike root,\r\nand after a few years lift up their heads again in the forest, at once\r\nornamental and nutritious.\r\n\r\nAt all these festivals the natives assemble in the various villages, and\r\nat these seasons spend days and weeks with each other. Earlier visitors to\r\nKar-Nicobar estimate the number of villages on the island at about six or\r\nseven only. The natives on the other hand gave us the names of the\r\nfollowing thirteen: Arrong (or Arrow), Saoui, Moose, Lapate, Kinmai,\r\nTapoimai, Chukchuitche, Kiukiuka, Tamalu, Paka, Malacca, Komios, and\r\nKankena, which all together would hardly number much above 100 huts, and\r\nabout 800 or 900 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSouthward of our anchorage we fell in with a small stream, which near its\r\nembouchure on the beach was lost in a sand-bank. Some of the members of\r\nthe Expedition explored it in a very small flat-bottomed boat, a Venetian\r\ngondola, which was transported across the bar in order to admit of its\r\nbeing sculled up the river. At first it was found to be about 2-1/2 feet\r\ndeep, by about 12 to 14 yards in width; the general direction of its very\r\nsinuous course being towards E.S.E. All around the forest presented a\r\nscene to which perhaps only the fantastic whimsicality of certain\r\ntheatrical forest sceneries might furnish a dim resemblance. Along the\r\nsteep bank of the river rose to a height of nearly 100 feet the slender\r\nNibong palm, adorned with blossoms and clusters of fruit, and close\r\nadjoining the graceful Catechu palm. Gigantic forest trees, with thick\r\nsquat trunks, extended their shady masses of foliage far over the stream;\r\nscrew-pines towering up from the scaffold-like arrangement of their\r\nnumerous roots, were reflected from the glassy bosom of the water; clumps\r\nof bamboo, absolutely alive with butterflies; nymph-like aquatic plants,\r\nmossy green banks, and tree-ferns with indescribably graceful corollae, all\r\ncombined here to form a landscape of the most enchanting richness, in the\r\nwater, on the shore, and in the air. Suspended over the whole scene,\r\npartly in leaf, partly in bloom, a gigantic garland of climbing and\r\ncreeping plants, in living cords of every variety of thickness, rose in a\r\nlofty arch above the limpid element, interlaced and girt round with\r\nthousands of blooming and flourishing parasites! Then, too, from amid the\r\nmysterious gloom started forth the strangest voices and cries, without our\r\nbeing able to descry the animals themselves. In the water, which was\r\nperfectly sweet to the taste, swarmed multitudes of fish of from one to\r\nfour inches in length. After rowing about one nautical mile and a half up\r\nthe stream, some rapids and rocks prevented our further progress, the\r\nstream itself being but twelve feet wide. A little further to the east\r\noccurs a similar small river, which however had even less water, and at\r\nits mouth is yet more sanded up and inaccessible than that above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nAfter we had lain for six days at anchor on the N.W. coast of Kar-Nicobar,\r\nand were once more casting about how to make out our long-desired\r\nexcursion through its almost impermeable forests, we suddenly perceived in\r\nthe distance upon the beach two men in European dress, with muskets upon\r\ntheir shoulders, who, conducted by some absolutely naked natives, speedily\r\napproached us. One, a fine-looking, well-formed young man of about 20,\r\naddressed us in French, saying he was supercargo of the Sardinian brig\r\n_Giovannina_ of Singapore, and was occupied in taking in a cargo of\r\ncocoa-nuts upon the southern shore of the island. The natives had been so\r\nunsettled by the arrival of a war-ship, that they loudly affirmed a pirate\r\nship had made its appearance, which would rob and destroy them all;\r\nwhereupon the most anxious of their number entreated the few whites who\r\nfortunately happened to be among them to start immediately for the north\r\nside of the island, where the Colossus lay at anchor, so as at all events\r\nto ascertain what was to be their fate. In the course of the conversation\r\nwhich sprung up between ourselves and the two strangers, we found that the\r\nsupercargo was a Frenchman, born at St. Denis in the island of Bourbon,\r\nand was named Auguste Tigard, while his companion was a Sardinian. They\r\nwere both singularly pale and embarrassed on first falling in with us,\r\napparently from surprise and delight at finding themselves so unexpectedly\r\nin the society of white men at so solitary a spot; ere long however they\r\nfelt themselves more at their ease, visited the frigate, were provided\r\nwith clothes, medicines, and wine, and at a later period were of much use\r\nto us in our intercourse with the natives. Tigard remarked that the\r\nsugar-cane, which at present grows wild on the island, could, judging by\r\nhis own personal experience, be very profitably grown for the production\r\nof sugar, as also that tobacco, cotton, and rice thrive in the most\r\nconspicuous manner.\r\n\r\nAt present the cocoa-palm is the sole plant which is cultivated by the\r\nnatives of Kar-Nicobar. It supplies them with all they require for food\r\nand lodging, for house-furniture, or for commerce with foreign peoples.\r\nThe stem of this slender column, from 60 to 100 feet in height, by about\r\n2-1/2 in thickness, with its heavy green thatch of leaves, is very porous\r\nand slight looking, but is yet stiff and strong enough to furnish\r\ncross-beams, laths, and masts for huts and boats. The fibres of the bark\r\nand of the nut-shells (known in commerce as _Coir_) supply cordage and\r\nline; the immense fan-shaped leaf (3 feet wide by 12 to 14 in length) of\r\nthe coronal serves as a covering for the roof, as also for plaited work\r\nand baskets. The juice of the nut, shaped like an egg, yet somewhat\r\ntriangular, and about the size of the human head, prevents the native from\r\nfeeling even in the slightest degree the absence of available spring\r\nwater, and is the sole beverage which invigorates and refreshes the\r\nwayfarer through these forest solitudes. Frequently did we experience a\r\nglow of thankfulness to all-bounteous Nature, as often as some hospitable\r\nnative handed to us for our refreshment, exhausted and thirsty as we were\r\nafter our fatiguing wanderings, a green cocoa-nut, that vegetable spring\r\nof the tropical forest.[12] The kernel of the ripe nut, thoroughly dried\r\nand pressed, gives forth a strong, clear, tasteless oil, which is used by\r\nthe natives for anointing their skin and hair, and at the same time forms\r\nso important an article in European commerce, that above 5,000,000 ripe\r\ncocoa-nuts are annually exported through foreign mercantile houses in\r\nexchange for European fabrics. The hard shell of the cocoa-nut is the sole\r\ndrinking cup of the Nicobar islanders, and the cooling, refreshing juice,\r\nwhich is extracted by an incision in the sheath of the palm-blossom before\r\nthe latter has expanded, is the sole fermented beverage of which they make\r\nuse. When brought into a state of fermentation it possesses similar\r\nintoxicating effects with the Chicha of the American Indian. Here, as\r\namong other half-savage races, we had occasion to remark, that the chief\r\nfood of the aborigines is also made available for supplying them with\r\ntheir favourite liquid stimulant, and just as the native of India effects\r\nthis purpose with rice, the African from the Yucca, or the Yam, the\r\nSouth-Sea Islander with the Kawa, and the Mexican with the Maize or the\r\nAgave, so the inhabitant of the Nicobars avails himself of the cocoa-nut\r\nat once for the supply of the first necessities of his existence, and the\r\nexcitement of his brain by artificial stimulant.\r\n\r\nOn 27th February, towards evening, after a stay of seven days on the north\r\nside of Kar-Nicobar, which had been spent in scientific operations of the\r\nmost varied nature, we again set sail, and next morning cast anchor on the\r\nsouth side of the same island, close to the village of Komios. The\r\ncurrent, which at this point sets to the E.S.E., runs about three miles an\r\nhour, so long as the flood-tide continues, but as soon as the ebb-tide\r\nsets in, it chops round, and runs with greatly diminished velocity. The\r\nlandings on the south side, which, on leaving the northern promontory,\r\nshows a much richer vegetation, are somewhat difficult to discover, since\r\nat almost all points reefs and coral banks project from the shore far into\r\nthe sea, so that after doubling the cape it is necessary to stop short a\r\npretty considerable distance from the land.\r\n\r\nWhile we were coasting along the eastern shore we could perceive through\r\nthe telescope, at the village of Lapate, consisting of some eight or ten\r\nhuts, a great number of women and children, who were rushing to and fro\r\namong the huts in the utmost confusion, till suddenly all disappeared in\r\nthe forest. These were evidently fugitives from the north side, who were\r\nnow once more betaking themselves to the forest, accompanied by the native\r\nfemales of the east and south sides, when they saw the dreaded floating\r\ngiant approaching them. A beach of dazzling white coral sand, sprinkled\r\nover with thousands of living mussels, low melancholy-looking mangrove\r\nswamps, and a superb forest of trees with lofty stems, through which lay a\r\nbeaten footpath, was all that the flat shore offered to our view. The\r\nFrenchman already mentioned had indeed apprized the inhabitants of our\r\narrival, and had endeavoured to explain to them our friendly intention,\r\nbut it was in vain,--the greater portion of the population had taken to\r\nflight, and only dogs and armed men were left behind. Here also we could\r\nnot see a single woman. However, we were informed by M. Tigard, who lived\r\nseveral weeks in the village of Kankena, and had been treated by the\r\nnatives as one of themselves, that the Nicobar women have their hair cut\r\nquite short, and simply wind round their dusky bodies, all smeared with\r\noil, a piece of white or red calico at the loins. They are generally ugly,\r\nbut strictly virtuous, and regard the Europeans as an inferior race, as\r\ncompared with their native lords.\r\n\r\nAs we were making for the land in what is called Komios Bay, near the\r\nvillage of the same name (situate according to our observations in 9 deg. 37'\r\n32'' N. Lat. and 92 deg. 43' 42'' E. Long.), a number of stalwart natives\r\napproached us from the forest, one of whom, who called himself Captain\r\nWilkinson, proved to be the most intelligent and graceful of their number.\r\nHe was extremely eager to give us a lot of information respecting the more\r\nsoutherly islands of the Nicobar Archipelago, with which the inhabitants\r\nof the southern coast appear to carry on more extensive commerce than\r\nthose on the northern shore. During the N.E. monsoons, canoes occasionally\r\nstart hence for the islands of Teressa, Bampoka, and Chowry. Wilkinson\r\nhimself once visited these islands in the barque _Cecilia_ of Moulmein,\r\nwith the view of fetching cocoa-nuts. The natives of Teressa, however,\r\nshowed such determined hostility to the captain of the vessel, that\r\nWilkinson advised him to abandon the island without further delay, ere the\r\nintended shipment of cocoa-nuts was completed.\r\n\r\nAnother English captain, named Iselwood, seems once to have carried over\r\nsome natives of Teressa to Kar-Nicobar, and afterwards taken them back\r\nagain. There does not exist, however, any regular commercial intercourse\r\nbetween Kar-Nicobar and the remaining islands of the Archipelago. The\r\nboats of the natives are much too small, and unsuitable to admit of their\r\nundertaking voyages to any distance, unless for some very important\r\npurpose, such, for instance, as bringing pottery ware from the island of\r\nChowry, or Chowra, where alone in the Archipelago that manufacture is\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman, Tigard, affirmed that the natives constantly spoke of\r\nanother race of men inhabiting the interior, who have but one eye in the\r\nmiddle of the forehead, who possess no fixed habitation, but pass the\r\nnight among the trees like wild beasts, and subsist upon fruits and roots\r\ndug up in the forest. This superstition meets with the more ready\r\nacceptance among the natives, as not one of them has ever penetrated into\r\nthe interior. All their villages lie along the shore, as far as the tract\r\nof coral sand reaches and the cocoa-nut is thriving. Here the frugal\r\nnative finds all that is necessary to satisfy his very limited\r\nrequirements. The cocoa-palm and the screw-pine (_Pandanus\r\nodoratissima_), whose fruit forms his chief article of food, as also the\r\nbetel shrub and the Areca palm, which furnish their cherished masticatory,\r\ngrow here, and the coral sand, which can be worked into the most excellent\r\nlime for building purposes, is only used by them for the purpose of\r\nobtaining that ingredient so prejudicial to the teeth, which serves to\r\nimpart to the betel the proper relish.\r\n\r\nFrom a passing observation of Wilkinson's we gathered that occasionally,\r\nduring the S.W. monsoons, earthquakes are experienced at Kar-Nicobar, and\r\nthis volcanic indication is yet more strongly marked on the adjoining\r\nisland of Bampoka. Despite the almost stifling heat, which raised the\r\ncolumn of mercury to 99 deg. in the shade, some of the members of the\r\nexpedition endeavoured to penetrate, with indescribable toil, into the\r\nswampy forest tract along the shore, and eventually succeeded in bringing\r\nback several objects which, though few in number, were of the utmost\r\nimportance, and well repaid their labour. Among the animals knocked over,\r\nthere was a gigantic bat, or flying Maki (_Pterops_), the native name of\r\nwhich is _Daiahm_.\r\n\r\nA foot-track led direct through the forest, cutting off the southern\r\ncorner of the island towards the western side. The natives had in vain\r\nendeavoured, with their customary importunities, to deter us from\r\nfollowing this path, assuring us that we should land ourselves in the\r\nthick of the jungle, which was full of poisonous serpents. However,\r\nnothing would serve us but to penetrate for once a little deeper into the\r\nforest. A youthful native, of the most elegant and symmetrical\r\nproportions, followed us at a long interval, but disappeared finally in\r\nthe woods. We wandered along in deep shadow between lofty colossal banyan\r\ntrees with hundreds of stems, and trunks interlaced with enormous branches\r\nof ivy, from whose summits hung down lianas of all sizes and dimensions,\r\nby which one might have clambered to the top as though by a rope, between\r\ntrees with smooth and glossy, or scarred and rugged, bark, which were\r\nthickly overgrown with parasitical plants. Enormous crabs, with fiery red\r\nclaws, and bodies of the most lovely blue-black, fled before us to their\r\nlurking-places in the depth of the forest. On right and left amid the\r\nparched foliage was heard the rustling of lizards, and from the summits of\r\nthe imposing forest trees resounded the musical hum of swarms of _cicadae_,\r\nwhile green and rose-coloured parrots flew shrieking from branch to\r\nbranch, and from the boughs and tendrils was heard the call of the Mania,\r\nor the cooing, murmuring love-note of the great Nicobar wood-pigeon.\r\nGradually the noise of the surf became once more audible, like distant\r\nthunder, just where a few cocoa-nut palms and screw-pines mingled with the\r\nlaurel trees around. We had reached the beach again.\r\n\r\nThe same day, towards 4 P.M., the frigate quitted the south coast of\r\nKar-Nicobar, and steered in a S.S.E. direction towards the little island\r\nof Batte-Malve, about twenty-one miles distant, in the neighbourhood of\r\nwhich we kept beating about the whole of the following day, without being\r\nable, in consequence of a stiff breeze and strong contrary current, to\r\napproach it sufficiently near for a boat to get to land, and thus enable\r\nus to make a more complete examination. Batte-Malve is a small, entirely\r\nuninhabited island, some two miles in length, and seems to be of a\r\nquadrangular form; the upper portion is thickly wooded; the highest\r\nelevation being from 150 to 200 feet. Towards the N.W. the island becomes\r\nsomewhat flattened when approaching the coast, whereas on the west side,\r\nas also on the S. and S.E. shores, the rocks descend perpendicularly into\r\nthe sea. According to our observations, instituted on the spot, there is\r\nin the longitude, as we ascertained it, when compared with that assigned\r\nby the officers of the Galatea, a discrepancy of ten nautical miles.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 3rd of March, while still to the N.W. of\r\nBatte-Malve, but steering a S.E. course, the islands of Teressa, Chowry,\r\nand Bampoka became visible at a distance of from eight to ten nautical\r\nmiles. From the main-mast-head we could also descry further to the\r\neastward the island of Tillangschong, to which we were now proceeding.\r\n\r\nNext morning we found ourselves close in with its N.E. promontory. Both\r\nwind and weather were highly favourable, the look-out man was stationed\r\nupon the fore-top, the lead line on being hove overboard with forty\r\nfathoms found no bottom, and the water had the deep blue colour of the\r\nopen ocean. We were therefore able to approach the shore fearlessly, and\r\naccordingly stood in till we were barely 100 feet distant from the steep\r\noctagonal-shaped cliff, which rises like a bastion at the north extremity\r\nof the island. We now edged off with the frigate and ran under the lee of\r\nthe land, coasting along the west side from north to south, never above\r\n150 or 200 feet distant from the shore; so close, in short, that, standing\r\non the deck, it seemed almost possible to stretch out the hand and touch\r\nthe beetling shore-cliffs, every stone and shrub being perfectly\r\ndistinguishable. Only a narrow rocky belt overhanging the surf appeared\r\nbarren of vegetation, the entire island with that exception being covered\r\nwith dense forest to the very summits, from 400 to 600 feet in height, of\r\nthe steep, projecting, knob-like eminences. It was a delightful,\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten sail along this rock-bound coast, the romantic\r\nbeauties of which passed before us like green dissolving views. The sea\r\nwas so smooth and peaceful that we seemed to be sailing on a mill-pond. At\r\nlast we opened a small sandy cove, in which we perceived a few cocoa-nut\r\npalms directly opposite. Here the lead promised us good holding ground,\r\nand the anchor was accordingly let go.\r\n\r\nOne of the side-boats conveyed to land the officers entrusted with the\r\nastronomical operations, as also the naturalists. Only with the utmost\r\ndifficulty was it possible to make way through the surf, and get under the\r\nlee of a reef, whence it was requisite to make a spring to get ashore. At\r\nthe spot at which we landed (named by us Morrock's Cove, and according to\r\nobservation in 8 deg. 32' 30'' N. and 93 deg. 34' 10'' E.) the island was almost\r\nexclusively clothed with trees and brushwood. Only close to the shore did\r\nany cocoa-nut palms present themselves to the view. Although quite\r\nuninhabited at the period of our visit, it was evident, by the traces of\r\nabandoned fire-places, split cocoa-nuts, and so forth, that human beings\r\noccasionally make this island their abode, albeit the assertion repeated\r\nby several writers, that Tillangschong is the Siberia of Nicobar\r\ncriminals, can only be set down to travellers' tales, or some utter\r\nmisapprehension of the meaning of the natives. It would seem that the\r\nresidents in Chowra and Bampoka come to this island from time to time, for\r\nthe purpose of collecting cocoa-nuts, and the fruit of the _pandanus_. By\r\ndint of strenuous exertion we made our way along river-courses, which\r\nduring the rainy season must rush down as most violent torrents, through a\r\nthick plantation of screw-pines, into the forest proper, which was\r\novergrown with the most majestic representatives of tropical vegetation.\r\nTo the botanist presented itself a great variety of interesting plants and\r\ntimber; to the lovers of sport numerous descriptions of birds, and more\r\nespecially pigeons, in such quantities that the various messes on board\r\nship were amply provided with them.\r\n\r\nSundown saw us returned on board, when the anchor was once more weighed.\r\nDuring the night we got so close in with the north side of the island\r\nthat, on the following morning, a boat well-manned and carefully equipped\r\nwas detached with one of the officers, who was instructed to round the\r\nnorthernmost promontory, in order to examine the northern and eastern\r\nsides of the island, and rejoin us on its southern shore. One of the\r\nzoologists, conceiving this minor expedition would furnish him with an\r\nexcellent opportunity for examining some of the lower orders of marine\r\nlife, attached himself to it. The frigate now put about, and coasted down\r\nthe west side southwards. Seen from a distance the vegetation seemed quite\r\nof a European character. The eminences varied in elevation from 250 to 300\r\nfeet. Judging from the direction of the foliage on the trees, the S.W.\r\nmonsoon seems to commit great ravages. Everywhere along the coast, but\r\nmore especially on the south side, serpentine cropped out--giving little\r\npromise of fertility. At many spots the cocoa-palms disappeared entirely;\r\na circumstance which must ever interfere materially with the settlement of\r\nthis island by a people to whom the most profuse natural treasures are\r\nworthless and unknown, beyond wealth in cocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\nNear the southern point we were suddenly alarmed at noticing an alteration\r\nin the colour of the sea, which led us to suspect the proximity of a\r\nsand-bank. Nevertheless a boat, lowered to try for soundings, found no\r\nbottom at 45 fathoms. In fact, the water was found to be transfused with\r\nan enormous mass of _crustaceae_, and small brownish filaments of 1/48 to\r\n1/12 of an inch in length, occasionally collected into a knot, which\r\nrendered it cloudy and muddy, and at once explained a phenomenon at first\r\nsight so unexpected. Towards 5 P.M. we passed the southern point of the\r\nisland, and somewhat later discovered a well-sheltered anchorage on the\r\nS.E. side of the island.\r\n\r\nConsiderable anxiety was felt as the sun went down, since the boat that\r\nhad been dispatched not only had not rejoined us but was not yet even\r\nvisible. As soon as darkness had fairly set in, blue lights were burnt on\r\nboard the frigate, of which the third was at last responded to by the crew\r\nof the boat, which had been provided with port-fires for such a\r\ncontingency. It seemed to be steering for the frigate. Hour after hour,\r\nhowever, flew by without its approaching us, and the rest of our signals\r\nremained unanswered. Thus morning broke, and still no boat was visible.\r\n\r\nAt length, about 7.30 A.M., the anxiously expected little wanderer hove in\r\nsight at a little distance, and half an hour later she came alongside all\r\nsafe. The projected operations had been only partially successful, owing\r\nto the extreme difficulty in making a landing. Surprised by nightfall, it\r\nwas no longer practicable to make out the ten nautical miles at least they\r\nwere still distant from the frigate, and the scanty crew consequently saw\r\nnothing for it but to anchor close in with the shore, and await the light\r\nof dawn in the boat. The cause of our later blue lights not being\r\nanswered, was partly the want of a sufficient supply of signal lights,\r\npart having been already expended, and the rest having got damp.\r\n\r\nWe now steered for Nangkauri harbour. Full in view lay the north shore of\r\nthe island of Kamorta, and, as we glided smoothly thither over the glassy\r\nsea, it loomed gradually nearer; an island of flat-topped hills, which,\r\ndespite its rank vegetation, had a park-like aspect, consequent on the\r\nalternations of forest and grass-slopes with the white coral beach,\r\ncrowned with cocoa-palms. Gradually the island of Tringkut came into view,\r\nsingularly level, and abounding in cocoa-palms and edible sea-slugs\r\n(Trepang), lying directly facing the entrance of the harbour-like channel,\r\nbetween Kamorta and Nangkauri. Our course, on which we were being\r\npropelled on a beautiful evening by a gentle soft wind which wafted us\r\nslowly but surely forwards, was indeed entrancingly delicious. Directly\r\nahead lay the low strand of Tringkut, shimmering whitely under the dark\r\ngreen canopy of foliage, while the long swell, breaking on the coral reefs\r\nlike glancing walls of foam, sunk away in the distance into the smooth\r\nmirror-like sea, which rose and fell almost imperceptibly, as though\r\npeacefully breathing. On the left lay Nangkauri, with its forests. On both\r\nsides of Kamorta and Nangkauri, huts and villages were visible sprinkled\r\nalong the shore, from which numerous natives put off in their canoes to\r\nthe frigate, but presently lay on their oars at a respectful distance, and\r\nfollowed us like a sort of squadron of observation. On the right was\r\nvisible in mid-channel between Tringkut and Kamorta the solitary rocky\r\nisland of Tillangschong; the shores of all these islands, and indeed the\r\nwhole horizon, being lit up with a gorgeous Fata Morgana. The extreme\r\nsouthernmost cliffs of Tillangschong seemed to be suspended entirely in\r\nthe air. The corners, at which jutted out the coast-lines of Tringkut and\r\nKamorta, seen along the horizon of the ocean resembled wedge-shaped\r\nincisions into the domain of the atmosphere; while the tips of the waves,\r\nlashed into foam as they broke upon them, seemed as if dancing in the air.\r\nThe canoes of the natives were reflected upside down, till the figures\r\nseated in them were so enormously lengthened that one could almost fancy\r\nthey were gigantic 'genii' disporting on the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nAs we were sailing along in front of the village of Malacca into the\r\nsplendid harbour, and just as the lead had almost a moment before marked\r\n23 fathoms, the look-out man suddenly descried a shoal. Notwithstanding\r\nthe man[oe]uvres that were at once put in execution, it was found\r\nimpossible to get entirely clear, and the frigate grounded forward of the\r\nbeam on the port-side. Although it was ebb-tide, yet deep water was\r\nobservable both ahead and astern, and accordingly an effort was made, by\r\nrunning out the guns and laying out a spring for the frigate to haul upon,\r\nto get the ship once more afloat, which accordingly speedily proved\r\nsuccessful, so that by sundown we were enabled to anchor in good holding\r\nground, opposite the village of Itoe, in the island of Nangkauri.\r\n\r\nHere we lay in a calm, tranquil sheet of water, such as we had not fallen\r\nin with throughout our voyage hitherto, surrounded by dense forest, from\r\nwhich were heard distinctly, on board ship, the disagreeable shrill sound\r\nof innumerable crickets, and the deep coo of the great Nicobar\r\nwood-pigeon. Except for these, the most profound stillness reigned. There\r\nwas not the smallest movement either in sea or sky. Although on our\r\nexcursion to Kar-Nicobar we had to endure great heat, it was here that for\r\nthe first time we experienced in all its discomfort the oppressive,\r\nrelaxing sultriness of the tropical atmosphere, when saturated with\r\nvapour. The thermometer stood pretty regularly at 84 deg. to 86 deg. Fahr., nor\r\nwas it possible to find any relief by plunging into the water, which was\r\nif anything even warmer than the air. Hemmed in on all sides, and with the\r\nwelcome beneficent sea-breeze frequently ceasing to blow for a week\r\ntogether, it was speedily pronounced a riddle, impossible to be solved,\r\nhow this harbour came to be once and again selected by German and Danish\r\nMissionaries for the purposes of colonization, unless the key to the\r\nmystery be found in its secure situation, the exquisite beauty of the\r\nmountain landscape, and the numerous clear spots around.\r\n\r\nThe very morning after our arrival we set out on a small reconnoitring\r\nexcursion to examine the ground, in order to decide, among so many objects\r\nclaiming our attention at once, what, considering the brief time at our\r\ndisposal, we might hope to undertake successfully, and what must once for\r\nall be abandoned. Our first visit was to the village of Itoe, which lay\r\ndirectly opposite our frigate's anchorage. The natives had all fled into\r\nthe forest, only their dogs having remained behind, who saluted us with a\r\ntremendous howl. The huts, six or eight in number, had a poor, miserable\r\nappearance, and were built close to a cocoa forest, so that there was not\r\nthe slightest space to move about in between the huts, the forest, and\r\nthe luxuriant underwood, so that free circulation of air was entirely\r\nprevented. In front of the village a number of Bamboo poles, with large\r\nbunches of ribbons waving about from their upper end, were stuck into the\r\nwater, for the purpose of frightening away the evil spirit or Eewee, and\r\ndriving him into the sea! In the interior of these few huts built of\r\nstakes, and of much inferior construction to those in Kar-Nicobar, was a\r\nlarge number of rudely cut figures of all possible sizes, and every\r\nvariety of position, suspended by strings, and supplying the most\r\nunmistakeable evidence of the superstitions of the natives. We had never\r\nseen these kinds of charms against the evil spirit at Kar-Nicobar, nor had\r\neven heard them spoken of. Quite close to the huts was the place of\r\ninterment. At one grave, apparently quite lately used, a large pole was\r\nerected, which was adorned with innumerable white and blue stripes waving\r\nin the wind, and from which had also been suspended axes, piles, bars,\r\nnails, and other tools and implements of labour of the deceased, so that\r\nthe whole scene much more resembled a rag-shop than a grave heap.\r\n\r\nFrom Itoe we proceeded to the peak of Monghata, on the island of Kamorta,\r\nlying just opposite Nangkauri. It was here that, in 1831, Pastor Rosen\r\nwished to found the projected settlement. He could hardly have selected a\r\nmore unsuitable site, since all around is either dense forest or mangrove\r\nswamp. The spots that had been cleared are now overgrown with _Saccharum\r\nKonigii_ (Lalang grass), of the height of a man, which usually follows\r\nhere upon spots that have been once cultivated and are afterwards\r\nabandoned, and which, if once taken root, can only with the utmost\r\ndifficulty be eradicated. From this peak, barely 200 feet in height, it is\r\npracticable to descend by a small footpath to the cove of Ulala, whose\r\nshores are entirely overrun with dense impassable mangrove swamp, and\r\naccordingly present a most dreary, gloomy aspect.\r\n\r\nOur next excursion was to the village of Enuang or Enong, where lay at\r\nanchor, under the British flag, two Malay prahus from Pulo Penang, manned\r\nby Malay crews, and taking in cargoes of ripe cocoa-nuts, edible birds'\r\nnests, and sea-slugs, or Trepang. The captain of one of these prahus and\r\nthe greater number of the crew were laid up with fever. The supercargo, a\r\nChinese named Owi-Bing-Hong, spoke English fluently, and was of the utmost\r\nservice to us in our communications with the natives. Enuang is larger\r\nthan Itoe, and has about a dozen huts, but these are one and all\r\nhalf-ruinous, very filthy, and utterly neglected. In all the huts we found\r\nnumbers of figures, cut in white wood in the very rudest style in various\r\npostures, mostly with a threatening, combative expression, intended to\r\ndrive away the evil spirit, of whom the natives seem to stand in great\r\ndread; for it is the universal practice of these islanders to ascribe\r\nwhatever happens to them to the influence of an evil spirit, and probably\r\nalso the appearance of the _Novara_ in the harbour of Nangkauri was laid\r\nto the account of the ill intentions of an Eewee. One constantly sees\r\nfruit, tobacco, or betel-leaves, prepared with pearl-lime, strewed in\r\nsmall portions at various spots in the interiors of the huts, or suspended\r\non the bamboo ladders by which they are entered, the object being to\r\npropitiate the Eewee in the event of his being hungry on his arrival! In\r\none of the abandoned huts we discovered a figure resembling a cat, rudely\r\ncarved in wood, before which the natives had placed tobacco and\r\ncocoa-nuts; almost all these figures were besmeared with soot, and daubed\r\nwith some red pigment, and their abdomens hung with long pendent dried\r\npalm-leaves.\r\n\r\nNot one of the natives at Enuang understood English. Only a couple of old\r\nmen spoke a few words of Portuguese, of which they were not a little\r\nconceited. The Portuguese, in the 17th and 18th centuries, seem to have\r\nbeen the first European nations that had any commercial dealings with the\r\nNicobar islanders. A number of words of their language, all referring to\r\nobjects of civilization, and but little corrupted from the Portuguese,\r\nsuch for instance as \"pang\" (for _pan_, the Portuguese for bread),\r\n\"zapato\" (shoe), \"cuchillo\" (knife), and so forth, are evidences of this.\r\nThe natives here seemed to us yet more hideous than those of Kar-Nicobar,\r\nespecially as the everlasting betel-chewing had disfigured their mouths in\r\nthe most shocking manner. It is however incorrect to allege, as has been\r\nthe case hitherto, that they avail themselves of a particular substance\r\nwith which to discolour the teeth, and which it was supposed induced this\r\nfrightful distortion of the mouth; it is unquestionably only the abuse of\r\nthe betel (consisting of Areca-nut, betel-leaves, and coral chalk) which\r\ncauses these disgusting disfigurements. At this settlement also the women\r\nand children had disappeared. Only one native woman, married to a Malay\r\nfrom Pulo Penang, who was at the moment officiating as cook on board one\r\nof the prahus lying at anchor in the bay, had the courage to present\r\nherself before us. She was, according to the custom of the Malays, dressed\r\nin silk, but bore on her body all the disagreeable traces of her Nicobar\r\norigin. She showed no reluctance to talk with us, and, in her somewhat\r\nscanty toilette, was the one solitary native woman with whom we found an\r\nopportunity of communicating during our entire stay at the various\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nFrom Enuang we visited the first settlement of the Moravian Brothers,\r\nlying on the small neck of land between Enuang and Malacca, where\r\napparently the amiable Father Haensel seems to have lived, for whose\r\ninteresting memoir, narrating his many years' residence upon the Nicobar\r\nIslands, we were indebted to the kindness of Dr. Rosen of the Moravian\r\nMission at Genaadendal in South Africa.[13] At present all is once more\r\nthick majestic forest; a marvellous leafy dome, like a green pantheon,\r\nencircles and overshadows the scene of the once benevolent activity of the\r\ndevoted missionary. Only a ruined well and a few brick fragments of what\r\nwas the oven, lying about, remain to show that a dwelling once stood\r\nhere. At the well there were a variety of beautiful flowers growing\r\nbetween the stones. The place is still called, as then, Tripjet, or the\r\n\"Habitation of the Friends.\" Here in quick succession most of the Brethren\r\ndied, (no fewer than eleven out of the thirteen,) upon which the mission\r\nwas transferred to the opposite island of Kamorta, first of all to the\r\nclearing at Kalaha, and ultimately to Kamut. But all these sites were as\r\nill-selected as the first. An abode located between swamp and forest, of\r\nwhich latter only a space of barely 1000 feet in circumference was\r\ncleared, could not but prove fatal in a very short space of time to the\r\nunfortunate colonists. At the village of Enuang too it would seem to be\r\nthat the last attempt at founding a settlement was made in 1835 by the two\r\nFrench missionaries; at least we were informed by several natives, who\r\nseemed to be at present about 34 to 36 years of age, that they were\r\nthemselves but boys when the last missionaries lived at Nangkauri. They\r\nalso further recollected that the gigantic cocoa-palms, which at present\r\nskirt the forest, were at that time quite small saplings, and the only\r\nvegetation between the beach and the mission house. At present enormous\r\nroots are stretching over the foundations of the earlier settlement. The\r\nnatives who accompanied us spoke with warm feeling of the missionaries,\r\nand seemed to regret their departure. Many professed themselves with much\r\nearnestness to be Christians, but they were so only in name. According to\r\nwhat they reported, many natives must at that period have been baptized\r\nin the islands of Chowra and Bampoka.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit to Enuang and Malacca, it had been one of the objects\r\naimed at by the members of the Expedition to draw up a small vocabulary of\r\nthe language of the natives, when it speedily appeared that, despite the\r\nproximity of the two islands, the dialects used by the inhabitants were\r\nentirely different. Even for trees and plants, for the feathered\r\ninhabitants of the forests, as well as domestic animals, the inhabitants\r\nof the central groups of islands have different names. The cocoa-palm and\r\nits noble fruit, the betel and its ingredients, are here known by entirely\r\ndifferent names. The accurate transcription of each individual word into\r\nGerman as pronounced by the native was hard work. It took us two days to\r\nmake a vocabulary of one hundred words! And even this slight success would\r\nhave been impossible but for our serviceable Chinese friend, Bing-Hong,\r\nwho had gone to school for two years at Pulo Penang, and could read and\r\nwrite English with tolerable readiness and accuracy. The distortion of\r\ntheir mouths is one main reason why the natives pronounce the greater\r\nnumber of their words almost unintelligibly; it is more a lisping mutter\r\nthan a language. Hence, apparently, their ability to follow out the\r\nconcatenation of ideas is so slightly developed, that it is only with much\r\ndifficulty they can be made to comprehend the particular subject\r\nrespecting which the information was wanted. For example, if it was wished\r\nto know the word in their language which expressed \"_blue_,\" and in order\r\nto make more intelligible what was required, a variety of objects of a\r\nblue colour were pointed out, they almost invariably named the object\r\nitself, and not the colour. Or again, one wanted to know what they called\r\n\"_leaf_\" in their language, and indicated the leaf of a tree standing\r\nnear; the native, however, replies by giving the name of the tree\r\n_itself_, instead of the word expressing leaf. It seems to us not\r\nunimportant to call attention to this circumstance, in order more\r\ncompletely to lay before the reader the great and manifold obstacles which\r\npresent themselves in drawing up vocabularies of the languages of\r\nhalf-savage races, and thus more readily secure indulgence for the\r\ndiscrepancies which are frequently to be met with in such works.[14]\r\n\r\nBing-Hong invited us to pay him a visit on board his vessel, which had\r\nalready been lying for several months at anchor in Nangkauri harbour,\r\ntaking in a cargo of ripe cocoa-nuts, of which a _Picul_, or 133-1/3\r\npounds, is worth in the Pulo Penang market 5-1/2 American dollars (L1\r\n3_s._ sterling). This hospitable Chinese informed us it was at the period\r\nof our visit the least unhealthy season in Nangkauri harbour: that as soon\r\nas the S.W. monsoon sets in, all foreign ships hurry away, through dread\r\nof the illnesses that follow in its track. However, feverish attacks are\r\nof daily occurrence throughout the year. Of the thirteen men who formed\r\nthe crew of the barque, ten were laid up with fever. The disorderly habits\r\nof life, however, of foreign visitors are much more to blame for these\r\nfrequent attacks of disease than the unhealthiness of the climate.\r\nConstantly they are guilty of excesses in diet and general negligence of\r\nhealth, bathing during the utmost heat of the day without any covering to\r\nthe head, exposing themselves to the burning rays of the noonday sun,\r\ndrinking for the most part nothing but the fluid contents of the unripe\r\ncocoa-nut, eating quantities of juicy fruits, the constant use of which\r\nacts injuriously on the systems of strangers, and sleeping on the damp\r\nsoil under the open air, exposed to all the noxious influences of the\r\natmosphere of a tropical forest without the slightest shelter. Bing-Hong\r\nshowed us the dried edible nests of the _Hirundo esculenta_ (in Malay\r\n_Salang_, in Nicobar _Hegai_), and presented us with a small packet of\r\nabout thirty nests. When properly dried, seventy-two of these tiny nests\r\nweigh one catty, or 1-1/4 lb., and they are sold at two rupees (4_s._) for\r\nthree of the inferior sort. The best quality is far more expensive. We\r\ncaused some of these Chinese dainties to be prepared exactly as prescribed\r\nby Bing-Hong, that is to say, they were boiled for one hour in hot water,\r\nbut we found the gelatinous mass quite tasteless, and, in fact, resembling\r\ndissolved gum. The swallow which constructs these edible nests does not\r\nhowever seem to be a regular visitant of the Nicobar Islands, and the\r\nprofits on this article of commerce, which is of such importance in Java\r\nand the rest of the Sunda Islands, are here scarcely worth naming.\r\n\r\nIt has been long disputed whence this industrious little warbler obtains\r\nthe material for his nest, and it was in all probability the circumstance\r\nthat it was generally believed to consist of particles of sea-weed,\r\nfish-roe, and marine animalculae of the _medusa_ class, which secured for\r\nthese nests such a celebrity among Chinese gourmands. A German naturalist,\r\nProfessor Troschel of Bonn, affirms however, on the strength of an\r\nanalysis of these nests, that the notion hitherto prevalent as to the\r\ncomponent parts of these nests is entirely erroneous, as they consist of\r\nnothing else than a thick, glutinous slime, secreted from the salivary\r\nglands, which, at the period when the Indian swallow builds its nest,\r\nswell out into large whitish masses. This slime, which is susceptible of\r\nbeing drawn out in long filaments from the bill of the animal, is quite\r\nanalogous to gum Arabic. Whenever the bird is desirous of constructing its\r\nnest, it causes this salivary substance, which at that period is copiously\r\nsecreted, to adhere to the crags, till its elegant nest is finished.\r\n\r\nOne of the days during which the frigate lay in Nangkauri harbour, the\r\ngeologist of the Expedition made an excursion in a native canoe along the\r\ncoasts of Kamorta and Tringkut, as these islands at the points where the\r\nshores are precipitous furnish the only possible geognostic facilities,\r\nthe forest or the thick covering of vegetation in the interior of the\r\nisland quite concealing the geological conformation. Our Chinese friend\r\nBing-Hong aforesaid accompanied him in the capacity of interpreter. When\r\nthe geologist had got some distance from the frigate, he found that the\r\nnatives had not abandoned their villages, and to this one alone of our\r\nfellow-travellers, manned and rowed along by natives, did some of the\r\nwomen become visible. They were as tall as the men, and quite as loathsome\r\nin appearance, the mouth similarly disfigured by betel-chewing, but the\r\nhair cut short. Around the body they wore a petticoat of red or blue\r\ncloth, reaching from the loins to the knee.\r\n\r\nAnother excursion was made to Ulala Cove, distant about four nautical\r\nmiles from our anchorage on the W. side of the island of Kamorta, on which\r\noccasion our Venetian gondola, specially constructed for similar\r\nexpeditions, was pressed into the service. The entrance to the cove is\r\nabout 3/4 of a mile in breadth, after which it expands in an easterly\r\ndirection with varying width, at the same time sending off arms in every\r\ndirection. The vegetation is exceedingly luxuriant and plentiful, and\r\nalong the swampy shore consists mainly of mangrove bushes, which at most\r\npoints make it almost impracticable to disembark, and impart to the entire\r\nbay a dreary, desolate appearance. At the few villages scattered along the\r\nshore, most of the natives had taken to flight. On this occasion, however,\r\nit was not child-like terror that had driven them away, but an evil\r\nconscience, for among the other inhabitants this bay enjoys the sad\r\nreputation of having on various occasions massacred the crews of small\r\nvessels, after having plundered them of everything. So strong is this\r\nfeeling that the natives of the rest of the Nicobar group, according to\r\ntheir own report, refuse to have anything to do with this ferocious set,\r\nand could not by any means be induced to accompany us in their canoes as\r\nfar as Ulala Cove.\r\n\r\nThe frigate lay five days in Nangkauri harbour, until the soundings and\r\ngeneral survey of this large bay with its numerous branches had been\r\ncompleted, when, on the morning of the 11th March, she sailed, with a\r\nfresh breeze from N.W., through the western entrance, which is scarcely a\r\nhundred fathoms wide, by fourteen in depth, and is marked by two rocky\r\npinnacles. Directly opposite lies the island of Katchal, thickly wooded to\r\nthe water-edge, and stretching out long and low, without any marked\r\nelevation above sea-level. We now sailed in between these islands of\r\nKatchal and Kamorta in a northerly direction towards the islands of\r\nTeressa and Bampoka. On the W. side of Kamorta a number of villages were\r\nvisible; on the N.W. we perceived at several spots natural meadows, while\r\nhereabouts the land gradually culminated into the highest point of the\r\nisland,--a conical hill, rising not very far from the shore, almost\r\nentirely without trees, except where near the summit a number of bushes\r\nand shrubs nestled in a sort of hollow. Three days were now lost in\r\nunsuccessful attempts to make head-way against wind and tide, so that for\r\nfour mortal days we were tossed about in full view of Bampoka, Teressa,\r\nand Chowra, never indeed above twenty miles distant, yet utterly unable to\r\nmake any one of them. As the time at our disposal for visiting these was\r\nexhausted in consequence of this unexpected difficulty, we were, very much\r\nto our regret, compelled to forego the satisfaction of setting foot on\r\neither of these islands, which, especially Chowra, would have presented a\r\nrare opportunity of examining the effect upon tropical races of men of an\r\nexcess of population. That rather barren island possesses, it seems, more\r\ninhabitants than it has the means of subsisting, and appears to be the\r\nonly spot of the entire Nicobar group where the natives follow industrial\r\navocations. All manner of pottery ware comes from Chowra, so that it would\r\nalmost seem as though the lamentable spectacle of a superabundant\r\npopulation had given the natives the first impulse towards active\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Teressa the Austrian Expedition had a more special\r\ninterest, in so far as it is by no means improbable that the adventurous\r\nBolts, who in 1778 visited the Nicobar Archipelago in the Austrian ship\r\n_Joseph and Theresa_, named this island, as he already had done in the\r\ncase of a fort on the coast of Africa, after the renowned Austrian\r\nEmpress, which, corrupted by the native dialect, had been gradually\r\ntransformed into Teressa or Terassa.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the 17th March there loomed on the horizon in a S.E.\r\ndirection, first the island of Meroe, then the two small islands of Treis\r\nand Track, and lastly the long mountain-chain of Little Nicobar, with the\r\nbeautiful island of Pulo Milu. The breeze was light, and a current of a\r\nvelocity of five miles an hour, which ran rushing and seething like a\r\nmill-race through the calm sea, so completely checked our progress that\r\nthe anchor had to be let go. This procured us the very unexpected pleasure\r\nof visiting these two small wooded islands. Owing to the heavy surf, we\r\nonly succeeded in effecting a landing by the assistance of some natives,\r\nwhom we happened to fall in with in their canoes off these all but\r\nuninhabited islets. Treis is a veritable pigeon island, full of the most\r\nvarious and beautiful species of that bird; nevertheless we could only\r\nprocure a single specimen of the exceedingly elegant Nicobar dove. Here\r\ntoo it was that the geologist found the first traces of brown coal, which\r\nhowever did not present itself in layers suitable for domestic use.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon, with the turn of the tide the current set in our\r\nfavour, and towards 10 P.M. we reached the roadstead protected to the\r\neastward by the northernmost point of Little Nicobar, to the westward by\r\nthe island of Pulo Milu, and southward by the mainland of Little Nicobar\r\nitself. It is not very large, but it has excellent holding ground, and\r\nwould be available at all seasons as a harbour of refuge for vessels. As\r\nmost of the villages of Little Nicobar lie on the N.W. and S. sides of the\r\nisland, and were with difficulty accessible from our anchorage, it was\r\nthought preferable to select the small but beautiful island of Pulo Milu\r\nfor our visit. Already, while we were lying at anchor in front of the\r\nisland of Treis, a few natives had come on board the frigate, and had\r\nshown much confidence. They possessed all the characteristics of the\r\nresidents of Nangkauri, and they also spoke, with but slight variations,\r\nthe same idiom. Only for certain objects, and those, singular to say,\r\narticles of the very first necessity, such as cocoa-nut trees, palms,\r\nscrew-pines, and the like, did they employ different expressions.\r\n\r\nThe island of Pulo Milu, with its variety of forest-vegetation, and its\r\ncharming woodland-scenery, displays all the beauty and all the marvels of\r\nthe tropics. The screw-pine (of the family of _Pandaneae_), that peculiar\r\ntree which imparts to the forests of Asia a character so different from\r\nthose of America, is seen here in exceptional size and majesty. Nowhere\r\nhave we met with this marvellous tree growing in such luxuriance as on\r\nPulo Milu, where it appears in such quantities as to resemble a forest,\r\nand leaves an impression of such lonely wildness as makes one almost\r\nimagine it a remnant of some earlier period of our earth. Wondering at the\r\ncapricious vagaries of nature, the traveller contemplates these\r\nextraordinary trees, which have leaves arranged in spiral order like the\r\ndragon trees, trunks like those of palms, boughs like those trees\r\npresenting the ordinary characteristics of foliage, fruit-cones like the\r\n_conifer[oe]_, and yet have nothing in common with all these plants, so\r\nthat they form a family by themselves. On Pulo Milu we saw some of these\r\ntrees with slim smooth stems 40 or 50 feet in height, which are nourished\r\nby and supported upon a pile of roots of 10 to 12 feet high, resembling a\r\nneatly-finished conical piece of wicker-work, composed of spindle-shaped\r\nstaves. Many of these roots do not reach the soil, and in this undeveloped\r\nstate these atmospheric roots assume the most peculiar shapes. Higher up\r\nthe same formation is repeated among the branches, from which depend\r\nbeautiful massy fruit-cones, a foot and a half in length, by one in\r\nthickness, which, when ripe, are of a splendid orange hue.\r\n\r\nThe screw-pine is not cultivated in the Nicobar Islands; it grows wild in\r\nthe utmost luxuriance, and, after the cocoa-nut, is for the natives the\r\nmost important plant that furnishes them with subsistence. The immense\r\nfruit-cones borne by this tree consist of several single wedge-shaped\r\nfruits, which when raw are uneatable, but boiled in water, and subjected\r\nto pressure, give out a sort of mealy mass, the \"Melori\" of the\r\nPortuguese, and called by the natives \"Larohm,\" which is also occasionally\r\nused with the fleshy interior of the ripe fruit, and forms the daily bread\r\nof the islanders. The flavour of the mass thus prepared strongly resembles\r\nthat of apple-marmalade, and is by no means unpalatable to Europeans. The\r\nwoody, brush-like fibres of the fruit which remain behind, after the mealy\r\ncontents have been squeezed out, are made use of by the natives as natural\r\nbrooms and brushes, while the dried leaves of the Pandanus serve instead\r\nof paper to surround their cigarettes.\r\n\r\nAt Pulo Milu, as is yet more markedly the case among the southernmost\r\nislands, the cocoa-palm does not grow so luxuriantly as on Kar-Nicobar,\r\nand to this circumstance may be chiefly ascribed the fact that the\r\nnatives are not so liberal as at the last-named island. The Swedish\r\nnaturalist, Dr. Rink, who has so largely and valuably added to our stock\r\nof information respecting the Nicobar group, resided here for a\r\nconsiderable time with some forty Chinese labourers, and, with a view to\r\nultimate colonization, had caused to be cut through the forest several\r\npaths, by means of which this island has been rendered much more permeable\r\nthan any other in the Archipelago. The selection was an extremely happy\r\none, and had the projected colonization of the island been carried into\r\neffect, very different results would have been obtained than those of poor\r\nDr. Rosen in Nangkauri Harbour. Next to Kar-Nicobar, it has been clearly\r\ndecided that Pulo Milu is the most suitable spot for a first settlement,\r\nin the event of any European power or any capitalist undertaking to solve\r\nthe problem of colonizing this Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn the cove at which we landed five huts stand upon the beach, much\r\nsimilar to those at Nangkauri, and like them having before them a number\r\nof lofty singularly ornamented poles emerging from the water, called by\r\nthe natives Handschuop, and intended to keep Davy Jones at a respectful\r\ndistance from the village,--not unlike the scarecrow with which we at home\r\nseek to frighten from the ripening corn the rapacious troop of feathered\r\nepicures. These banners for scaring away the Eewees are erected within the\r\nsea limit by the Manluena, or exorcist, who in these islands, like the\r\nmedicine-man of the Red Indian of America, or the Ach-Itz of the Indian\r\nraces among the highlands of Guatemala, exercises the utmost influence\r\nover all the affairs of life. Here, as elsewhere, most of the natives had\r\ndisappeared on our approach. We found but five men, who were all at least\r\npartially clad; some wore shirts, trowsers, and caps; another had\r\nenveloped his person in an immense, and by no means over-clean, piece of\r\nlinen. One of this number, who acted as our guide through the island, and\r\ncalled himself \"John Bull,\" was not a regular resident in Pulo Milu, but\r\nin Lesser-Nicobar, and had only come over to the island for the purpose of\r\nconstructing canoes of trunks of trees hollowed out. He spoke English with\r\ntolerable fluency, and displayed quite child-like satisfaction, as often\r\nas any English word, no matter what, was recalled to his recollection,\r\nwhich had slipped his memory from want of practice. John Bull soon became\r\nvery insinuating, and expressed a wish to accompany us to Great Nicobar,\r\nwhere, as he assured us, at Hinkvala, one of the villages on the southern\r\nshore, he had several relatives, among others one named \"London,\" who\r\ncould be of the utmost service to us. For his kind offices we promised him\r\na present, upon which he asked with the most naive simplicity: \"You not\r\ntalk lie?\" from which we may conjecture that not every promise made to him\r\nby a stranger was duly fulfilled. The huts of the natives were constructed\r\nof beams, exactly like those in the central island; and the internal\r\narrangements were precisely identical. Here also are figures sculptured\r\nin wood, Eewee-charms, which especially are found in the interiors of the\r\nhouses in such numbers and in such quaint costumes, that one is almost\r\ntempted to imagine the inhabitants of these huts must be proprietors of\r\nsome Marionette-theatre. We also found here various objects carved in soft\r\nwood, among others a large serpent, a tortoise, and several droll figures,\r\nas also a seven-holed flute of bamboo-reed, the model for which had\r\nevidently been supplied by some of the Malay sailors from Pulo Penang.\r\n\r\nThe same evening we weighed anchor, and shaped our course along the\r\neastern shore of Lesser-Nicobar, which is thickly covered with swamp and\r\nforest. On the morning of 19th March, we were abreast of the island of\r\nMontial in St. George's Channel, and by evening had anchored on the\r\nnorthern side of Great Nicobar, S.E. of the island of Kondul, which also\r\nlies in the Channel. Already before sunrise the boats were lowered and\r\neverything got in readiness for a visit to the small but delightful island\r\nof Kondul, which, though on the N.W. side so lofty and rocky as to be\r\nalmost inaccessible, presents on its E. side a tolerably secure\r\nlanding-place, situated according to our observations in 7 deg. 12' 17'' N.\r\nand 93 deg. 39' 57'' E. Here we found a number of huts, but not one single\r\nnative was visible. We now endeavoured, by following up a torrent bed, to\r\nclimb to the highest point of the island, which has an elevation of 350 to\r\n400 feet. In this we only succeeded after most severe exertion,\r\noccasionally having to avail ourselves at the steepest parts of the ascent\r\nof the gigantic roots of trees, or of the climbing plants that hung\r\nsuspended like natural ropes, by means of which we swung ourselves among\r\nthe huge blocks of rock, till we could gain a secure footing. Instead,\r\nhowever, of finding, as we had hoped, a small _plateau_ at the summit, or\r\nat all events discovering some less difficult path by which to descend, we\r\nwere sorely disconcerted, on arriving thoroughly exhausted on the top, at\r\nfinding the rock descended so sheer and precipitous on the other side that\r\nit was impossible to make one step further. However, we found here a\r\ndelicious refreshing breeze. With pleasure indescribable, our gaze\r\nwandered to the island of Great Nicobar and the islet of Cabra, lying\r\nimmediately opposite us, their green luxuriant shores bathed on all sides\r\nby the azure ripple of the ocean. Although no rain had fallen for more\r\nthan six months, the vegetation was on the whole wonderfully fresh and\r\nabundant, the forest lovely and majestic as on \"the first day of\r\nCreation!\"\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves compelled to retrace our steps by the same break-neck\r\npath by which we had ascended the peak. On the shore we encountered some\r\nof the natives, whose curiosity had got the better of their apprehensions,\r\nand who now slunk out of the forest, to discover what was our peculiar\r\nobject in landing on the island. Among their number was a native doctor,\r\nand Eewee exorciser; he was however in no way distinguishable from the\r\nrest of his brethren, unless by the inordinate length of his hair, which\r\nflowed down far below his shoulders. One of the members of the Commission,\r\ndesirous of getting at the treatment pursued by these sly knaves when\r\nthey go to work with their poor credulous dupes of patients, promised this\r\ndusky disciple of AEsculapius a present, if he would cure him by his own\r\nmethod, and affected to have an intolerably severe pain in the left arm.\r\nThe Manluena displayed his treatment with a vengeance; he laid hold of the\r\nsupposed sufferer by the arm, which he pinched and punched, till there was\r\nnot a spot that had not received his attentions, while during the entire\r\nprocess he now screamed aloud, now whistled, now blew vigorously upon the\r\nbare skin, as though endeavouring to expel the Evil Spirit. According to\r\nthe belief of these poor people, every bodily pain is nothing other than a\r\ndemon magically introduced into the system through the evil influence of\r\nan Eewee. The Manluena commenced to pinch the arm from above, performing\r\nthis anything but agreeable manipulation with his hands lubricated with\r\ncocoa-nut oil, from above downwards, the object being to drive out the\r\nEewee from the arm by the finger points! Although the doctor had not used\r\nhis patient very tenderly, he nevertheless in the opinion of the natives\r\nhad not appeared to put forth all his powers, and had made use of far\r\nfewer noises and contortions than had been usual with him when one of\r\nthemselves was undergoing treatment. Moreover his original confidence\r\nseemed to fail him in his anxiety lest some mischance should befall him in\r\ncase this attempt at a cure should miscarry, and accordingly he speedily\r\nmade off, after he had been complimented with a few threepenny bits for\r\nhis trouble, nor did he again make his appearance the whole day.\r\n\r\nSome of the members of the Expedition had resolved to ramble quite round\r\nthe island; the circumference of which is little if at all more than eight\r\nEnglish miles. At early morning they had started with their guns and\r\nbotanical boxes on their shoulders full of the most buoyant expectation of\r\nsecuring an ample store of curiosities, starting from the east coast and\r\nthence to the north side of the island; and towards sunset they made their\r\nappearance at the south side, foot-sore and nearly exhausted. In the\r\nardour of the chase and of collecting \"specimens,\" they had plunged so\r\ndeep into the forest, thereby losing all trace of the direction by which\r\nthey had entered, that as the sun was already beginning to descend, they\r\nhad no alternative but to hew a path with their hatchets through the\r\nthickest of the forest, so as to reach the beach once more. At times\r\nhanging by creepers, at others swimming at various spots where the rocks\r\ndipped perpendicularly into the sea, they at length arrived at the spot\r\nwhere we were re-embarking, hungry, thirsty, and in a state of such\r\nextreme exhaustion that we at first were really apprehensive for their\r\nlives. Singularly enough these severe hardships were followed by no evil\r\nconsequences to any one of the party, though the recollection of them will\r\nsurely not fade out of their memory for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe 21st March, being a Sunday, was duly observed, and was kept as a\r\nmuch-needed day of rest, no boat going to shore. Towards noon a pretty\r\nsmart shower of rain fell, the first for six months. Several of the\r\nnatives came off in their canoes, and brought fowls, eggs, cocoa-nuts, and\r\nvarious other fruits, as also monkeys and parrots. Rupees, English\r\nshillings and sixpences, were evidently not unknown to them, as they\r\ngreatly preferred these in exchange to mere toys and showy articles.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd we made an excursion to a bay on the island of Great Nicobar\r\nor Sambelong. All that portion of the coast lying opposite our anchorage\r\nwas quite uninhabited, evidently in consequence of the entire absence at\r\nthis point of the cocoa-palm, whereas on the west coast there are several\r\ngood-sized villages. Unfortunately, however, these lay at far too great a\r\ndistance from the frigate to permit of an excursion being made thither. As\r\nour boat, after an hour's rowing, approached the little bay, we perceived\r\nat the mouth of a small creek the singular spectacle of a dead mangrove\r\nforest. Some great storm had apparently thrown up a sand-drive here, so as\r\nto cut off the supply of sea-water even at full tide. As the mangrove only\r\nflourishes in salt or brackish water, it had thus been deprived of its\r\nvital element, and the trees had accordingly perished in the fresh water.\r\nBut the lofty stems still stood, withered and blighted, a ghastly garden\r\nof death amidst delicious green peaks covered with forest. As the sun\r\nrose, a white vapour lay like a winding-sheet over the dead swamp: one\r\nfelt the uncomfortable sensation of being in a place where miasmata were\r\npoisoning the air, while the soil was generating death. The rigid\r\nskeletons of these trees recall to the recollection of the stranger, who\r\nstands marvelling at the all-powerful energies of Nature to create and\r\ndestroy in these regions, how many corpses of his fellow-Europeans are\r\nmouldering beneath the damp soil of this island! Fortunately the river has\r\nonce more broken through the bar, and given access to the sea-water, so\r\nthat beneath the dead forest a fresh green vegetation was fast springing\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe crew of a Malay prahu from Penang had selected this dull spot for a\r\nregular settlement, in order to collect ripe cocoa-nuts, and Trepang, the\r\nedible sea-slug (_Holothuria_) already mentioned, the latter for the\r\nChinese market. These people occupied a large wooden shed, and were\r\nprovisioned for a somewhat long stay. Except this shed there was not one\r\nsingle hut here, all around being nothing but dense forest and swamp; but\r\nsome natives of the island of Kondul came over in their canoes to trade\r\nhens and eggs with us. The Malay vessels which visit these islands almost\r\nall come hither from Penang, about the beginning of the N.E. monsoon, and\r\nremain during the whole of the dry season, so as to take in a full cargo\r\nof the various natural produce of the island. They bring for barter fine\r\nChinese tobacco, calico, knives, axes, hatchets, cutlasses, clothes, and\r\nblack round hats. In former years they also imported the betel shrub into\r\nGreat Nicobar for propagation; where, in fact, it has been planted, and\r\nhas since then increased to such an extent that its importation is no\r\nlonger remunerative. With the commencement of the S.W. monsoons and the\r\nrainy season, the Malay traders with their profitable cargoes make their\r\nway back to Penang, and the other places along the coast of the peninsula\r\nof Malacca. Thanks to the presence of these people, the members of the\r\nExpedition were enabled to compare the Nicobar idiom with that of the\r\nMalays, and could thus ascertain the exceeding discrepancies between these\r\ntwo languages.[15] These merchants ordinarily bring with them a few\r\nindividuals who have a slight knowledge of the Nicobar language, as the\r\nMalay tongue is not understood anywhere in this archipelago.\r\n\r\nOne of the Malay seamen, named Tschingi, from Penang, whose caste was\r\nindicated by the long stripes of a bluish green colour painted upon his\r\ndark brown forehead, peculiar to the Hindu god Siva, told us that he\r\nrecollected being employed as a boy in the service of Pastor Rosen on the\r\nisland of Kamorta, with whom he remained till his return to Europe. He\r\nspoke with much admiration of that estimable and thoroughly deserving\r\ngentleman, and remarked that many Chinese and other settlers had\r\naccompanied him to Kamorta, all of whom speedily succumbed to the fever.\r\n\r\nThe native known as John Bull, who had followed us hither from Pulo Milu,\r\nmade his appearance at the bay, accompanied by some of his kindred, and\r\nbrought us some provisions. He seemed firmly to believe that in the\r\ninterior of the island of Sambelong, in its southern part, there existed\r\nsome wild inhabitants of a different race, Baju-oal-Tschua (or junglemen,\r\nas he called them), who lived entirely in the woods, in small huts\r\nerected upon the banks of the streams, and were so timid that they took to\r\nflight so soon as any one endeavoured to approach them. He also told us\r\nthat in the S. and S.W. sides of Sambelong there were eleven villages:\r\nviz. Hinkoata, Changanhei, Hinhaha, Haengangloeh, Kanalla, Taeingha,\r\nDayak, Kanchingtong, Dagoak, Hinlawua, and Kalemma.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day, not only was a highly successful onslaught made\r\non the denizens of the woodland, but even the fishes in bay were not\r\nexempted from our attentions;--a net, which was flung over the side and\r\nretained there barely half an hour, being hauled ashore with upwards of a\r\nhundred weight of small fish. Of this the entire ship's company partook,\r\nand sufficient was left over for the next day. Our quarry in the swamps\r\nand forest consisted of snipes, of a splendidly plumed Maina bird\r\n(_Gracula Indica_), eagles, and apes; unfortunately a number of the\r\nanimals shot were lost by their retreating into the thicket, where they\r\ncould not be recovered.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 23rd of March the frigate again made sail and\r\nsteered along the west coast of Great Nicobar, while two boats' crews were\r\ndespatched with the requisite instruments to examine this quite unexplored\r\ncoast. This plan, however, proved only half successful. The tremendous\r\nsurf, into which the long swell setting in from the S.W. is broken\r\nhereabouts, hurled the larger boat upon the beach with such violence that\r\nit was capsized, by which a great portion of her freight was utterly lost,\r\nand her crew could only escape to shore by swimming. The smaller, or\r\njolly-boat, returned to the ship with two of her crew to fetch assistance\r\nfor these woe-begone wights. One of the latter, who coolly spoke of the\r\naccident as a \"_piccola disgrazietta_,\"[16] with the same breath informed\r\nus that almost all the instruments, note-books, and implements of the\r\nchase which had been taken on board, were irretrievably gone. Another\r\nquarter-boat was despatched to bring off our shipwrecked companions, who\r\nmeanwhile remained on the shore in anything but enviable plight, soaked to\r\nthe skin, hungry and thirsty, and busily employed in fishing up some few\r\nof the articles that had been overturned into the water. At last both\r\nboats got safely back in company about midnight, but under such\r\ncircumstances that it was out of the question to think of prosecuting the\r\nexamination that had been commenced. We now lay a course for the southern\r\nbay of Great Nicobar, where, shortly after 9 P.M. of the 24th March, we\r\ncast anchor near the little stream called \"Galatea\" by the Danish\r\nexpedition. The midshipman intrusted with the commission of selecting the\r\nmost suitable spot to disembark, returned after several hours' absence,\r\nwith the little consolatory intelligence, that along the entire reach of\r\ncoast which he had examined, there was but one solitary spot at which it\r\nwas possible to land without danger from a boat of European construction.\r\nIn the course of the day we received numbers of natives on board; among\r\nthe rest, one man still young, with immense spectacles, which undoubtedly\r\nwere worn much more for personal adornment than for use. They brought off\r\nfor sale a few apes, parrots, hens, swine, cocoa-nuts, as also some rosin,\r\ntortoise-shell, amber, and a few large eggs of a species of wood-pigeon,\r\ncalled by the natives Mekeni, of which unfortunately we did not succeed in\r\nseeing a single specimen, despite our utmost exertions.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, 26th March, amid occasional premonitory symptoms of\r\nthe approach of the rainy season, the naturalists and some officers\r\nendeavoured to effect a landing at a place where alone it seemed possible\r\nfor the broad, clumsy boats of our western waters. In this we succeeded.\r\nAgain we were able, although drenched to the skin, to set foot on Nicobar\r\nsoil. It was for the last time we did so. Not a single vestige could be\r\ndiscerned along the beach of any human habitations:--all was thick\r\ntropical forest, fringed with enormous _Barringtoni[oe] Gigante[oe]_,\r\nwhich in all their primeval weirdness flung their branches over the water,\r\ninterlaced in wild confusion. After half an hour's wandering along the hot\r\nbeach, we came unexpectedly, at a point somewhat south of our point of\r\ndisembarkation, upon a couple of wretched disconsolate-looking huts. Not a\r\nhuman being was visible,--only a pair of hens and a pig, which were\r\nparading about untended; the bamboo poles, which usually figure in front\r\nof the native huts, had been carried away. However, in their absence it\r\ndid not cost us much trouble to penetrate into the interior. A few weapons\r\nof war or the chase, a number of hollowed-out perfumed cocoa-nut shells\r\nsuspended above the fire-place, a pair of elegantly plaited baskets, a\r\nboat's sail made of pandanus leaves, some straw mats, and a couple of\r\nmarvellously finished figures, formed the very miscellaneous inventory of\r\nthis Nicobar household. The figures (cut in wood) and a very\r\nneatly-executed basket attracted to themselves our special attention as\r\ninteresting specimens of the industry and taste of the natives of Nicobar.\r\nWe could not resist possessing ourselves of these, at the same time\r\nleaving in recompense a quantity of shining six-penny pieces, fully twenty\r\ntimes the utmost possible value of what had been taken away, depositing\r\nthem in one of the baskets which was suspended in a conspicuous position\r\nin the middle of the hut.\r\n\r\nAdjoining this hamlet was a forest of cocoa-palms. We penetrated into it,\r\nand suddenly found ourselves, to our great astonishment, on the track of a\r\nwell-worn footpath, which was probably, with the exception of the paths in\r\nGreat Nicobar and Pulo Milu, in better condition than any other we had\r\nhitherto encountered in the Nicobar Islands. What more natural than to\r\nsuppose that a path so well worn must necessarily lead to an important\r\nsettlement? It passed first through an extensive and splendid\r\npalm-plantation, and afterwards through a very beautiful clump of leafy\r\ntrees, fringing a little brook, whose channel, it being then the end of\r\nthe dry season, was quite dried up. Frequently we were obliged to clamber\r\nover steep blocks of rock, with footsteps hewn in them by the hand of man,\r\nfor facilitating the passage, and at last, after a scramble of several\r\nhours, highly interesting, but exceedingly fatiguing, we reached a cleared\r\nspot on the sea-beach, but without being able to discern the remotest\r\ntrace of any human habitations. On the contrary, it seemed to admit of no\r\ndoubt that this path, as also some spots that had been cleared, were\r\nnothing but the preparations for an intended settlement, which can only be\r\nsuccessfully carried out here where the cocoa-palm and screw-pine have\r\nfirst struck root. Some of the sailors, who accompanied us as porters and\r\nescort, went forward as far as the extreme point of the bay, but there\r\nalso they found no trace of any human abode. After a brief rest we\r\nreturned by the same track, to the spot at which we had disembarked, where\r\nwe were joined by some of the officers, who, more fortunate than\r\nourselves, had encountered some of the natives, and had even seen them in\r\ntheir dwellings. They spoke of the interiors of the huts they visited as\r\nbeing quite as wretched as those on the other islands, only the\r\ninhabitants did not seem so shy or timorous. Far from this, they had\r\nregaled our lucky companions with palm-wine, and had accompanied them till\r\nthey fell in with us. With this visit ended the thirty-second day of our\r\nstay in the Nicobar Archipelago, only one half of that period having been\r\nspent on land, the rest having been occupied in beating about against\r\nunfavourable winds.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, we take our departure from this most interesting group of\r\nislands, _en route_ for the Sunda Islands and China, we shall be excused\r\nfor briefly recapitulating the main results of our observations and\r\ninvestigations, while referring the reader for a more detailed\r\nspecification of our labours to the various special divisions yet to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThe Nicobar Islands, situated right in the most important highway of\r\ncommerce, which is destined to acquire yet greater importance, so soon as\r\nthe projected opening of the Suez Canal has been carried out, and\r\nextending in their general direction from S.S.E. to N.N.W., seem like an\r\nextension of the main central mountain-chain of Sumatra, which is\r\nprolonged yet further to the northward through the Andaman group, and in\r\nits crescent-shaped arrangement, with the convexity towards the westward,\r\ncorresponds with Cape Negrais in the peninsula of Malacca. If from this\r\nArchipelago, as a centre, a circle be described of about 1200 nautical\r\nmiles of radius, it will include the most important commercial cities of\r\nIndia, as well as Ceylon, the majority of the Sunda Islands, and Cochin\r\nChina. The winds usually prevalent here greatly facilitate the passage of\r\nvessels from the adjoining islands and coasts of _terra firma_, and\r\nproportionately enhance the importance of this Archipelago.\r\n\r\nWith but few exceptions, the shores of the whole group of islands consist\r\nof coral sand, or are fringed with coral banks, which latter extend\r\nseaward to a depth of thirty fathoms. In like manner almost all the bays\r\nseem to be edged with coral reefs, if indeed they are not actually studded\r\nwith them. The promontories frequently present cliffs both above and below\r\nthe level of the ocean, extending a couple of miles into the sea, which,\r\nwhat with the occasional rapid currents and light breezes, are not always\r\nvery easily weathered. The prevailing winds are the two monsoons, the N.E.\r\nin the months of November, December, January, February, and March, the\r\nS.W. in May, June, July, August, and September. During the months of April\r\nand October, there are variable winds and calms, extending more or less\r\ninto the adjoining months. The currents vary in direction with the\r\npassages between the islands, and depend upon the ebb and flow of the\r\ntide, varying in force and direction with the tidal phenomena. Ordinarily\r\nthese make themselves felt during the making of the tide from S.W. to\r\nN.E., and in a contrary direction during the ebb.\r\n\r\nDue south of Kar-Nicobar, we found while lying at anchor a current running\r\n3-1/2 miles an hour, two days after the full moon; north of Little\r\nNicobar, near the small island of Treis, where the current compelled us to\r\nanchor, its velocity, as we experienced two days after new moon, is as\r\nhigh as 4-1/2 miles an hour. These observations refer to a period when the\r\nvelocity of the current was at its maximum. In light winds, and when near\r\nthe coast, one must always let go the anchor, or at least lay out a kedge,\r\nthe latter however being barely sufficient at several spots immediately\r\nafter the full or the new moon. According to observations made during five\r\ndays about the period of full moon, the course of tide at Kar-Nicobar may\r\nbe assumed at 9h. 40m., and the difference in height between ebb and flood\r\nat five feet.\r\n\r\nIn these waters, and in a still more marked degree in the latitude of\r\nSumatra, occurs a belt within which the wave-currents form what is known\r\nto English navigators as \"The Ripples.\" The sea here is ranged\r\nzone-fashion, so to speak, as though in fact in a state of ebullition, and\r\nmakes a considerable noise, yet without there being anything to indicate\r\nan increased strength of current; since, on the contrary, we found when\r\nreaching these tracts, that the velocity of current was if anything rather\r\ndiminished. We conceive this phenomenon may be attributed to the agitation\r\ncaused by partial tidal currents, crossing each others' course, and\r\noccasionally even running counter to each other, as also to certain\r\nspecial conditions of ocean temperature at varying depths. The changes of\r\nthe tides at points of the coast, proportionally speaking so near each\r\nother, are so widely different in point of time, and the height reached by\r\nthe waves is so little uniform, that any such phenomenon as the above must\r\nnaturally make itself perceptible at the surface in the open sea.\r\n\r\nWhile the change of tide at Kar-Nicobar takes place every 9h. 40m., that\r\nof Cape Diamond in Sumatra is laid down in the English chart at 12h., and\r\non the sand-banks in the Straits of Malacca at only 5h. 30m. The\r\ndifference in elevation assigned exhibits a similar discrepancy in the\r\nestimates; that for Kar-Nicobar being stated at five feet, that for Cape\r\nDiamond at 10 feet, and on the sand-banks already mentioned at 15 feet.\r\nThe hurricanes of the Bay of Bengal never visit the Nicobars; they seem to\r\noriginate part in or about the Andaman Islands, part from the west coast\r\nof Sumatra, proceeding in the former case towards the northern portions of\r\nthe gulf, and in the latter towards the Coromandel coast and Ceylon.\r\n\r\nDuring the S.W. monsoon, in which occurs the rainy season, frequent\r\nthunder-storms and even gales of wind occur, especially in the vicinity of\r\nGreat Nicobar. The dry N.E. monsoon again brings fine weather, but\r\nsometimes blows with considerable strength.\r\n\r\nKar-Nicobar has no regular harbour, but presents on its north side a\r\nspacious land-locked bay nearly rectangular, the holding ground of which\r\nis a coral sand of from 10 to 16 fathoms, and is thoroughly sheltered to\r\nthe S.W. and N.E. During the N.E. monsoon it is advisable to lie somewhat\r\ncloser in with the northern promontory of the island. At this season it is\r\ndifficult to find any spot at which small boats can disembark. However,\r\nnear the northern point it is possible to reach the shore in a small cove,\r\nthe western boundary of which presents an open space of coral sand, where\r\nit is possible to lie to in deep water with even a good-sized boat. The\r\nvillage of Saoui, which gives its name to the roadstead, is not readily\r\naccessible during the N.E. monsoon in consequence of the surf, but the\r\nvery next indentation of the coast facing eastwards, which is protected\r\nseaward by a coral reef, offers a well-sheltered point of disembarkation,\r\nwhere the boats can be beached on the smooth coral sand, and thereafter\r\ndrawn up high and dry.\r\n\r\nDuring the N.E. monsoon it is also practicable to avail oneself of the bay\r\non the S. side of Kar-Nicobar, or to anchor anywhere along the W. side of\r\nthe island, but such anchorages possess no other protection than is\r\nafforded by long points of land projecting far into the ocean, and usually\r\nprotracted by coral reefs.\r\n\r\nBoth in the bay of Saoui, and on the south side of Kar-Nicobar, are found\r\nsmall brooks, which run with water even during the dry season. It is\r\ndifficult however to water hereabouts, because these rivulets are blocked\r\nup with sand-bars, not to speak of the obstacles interposed to the landing\r\nof boats, by the tremendous surf and the low swampy shore at most periods\r\nof the year. In cases of extreme necessity, however, the little rivulet\r\ncalled the Areca might with some difficulty be made available.\r\n\r\nChowra, Kamorta, and Bampoka, have no regular anchorages; a vessel must be\r\ncontent to ride to leeward of that coast, which will act as a shelter\r\nagainst whichever monsoon happens to be blowing. Disembarkation by means\r\nof boats is extremely difficult, and it is much better to make use of a\r\nnative canoe, which, after transporting the visitor through the surf to\r\nthe land, can be more easily drawn up on the beach.\r\n\r\nTillangschong possesses a beautiful harbour on the S. side, which however\r\nis open to the S.E., but during the greater part of the year affords an\r\nexcellent anchorage. The most southerly point has numerous cliffs and\r\nneedles of rock where it projects into the sea, but it is possible to\r\napproach within a few fathoms of the southernmost of these with vessels\r\nof any size.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the island, at the spot where its two halves may be\r\nsaid to blend, the northernmost rugged, the more southerly flat, a pretty\r\ngood anchorage will be found, which seems to be sheltered towards the S.W.\r\nby several solitary projecting rocks. Generally speaking, but more\r\nespecially to the N. and E., this island presents a steep precipitous\r\nshore, so that, with the exception here and there of a few solitary rocks,\r\nclose in to the shore, there is nothing but clear deep water around almost\r\nthe entire island to within about 10 fathoms of the land.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Nangkauri is rather roomy, but of very unequal though for\r\nthe most part considerable depth; the soundings in its midst giving\r\nbetween 20 and 30 fathoms. The promontories are all more or less\r\nlow-lying, and thickly beset with coral reefs, and caution is the more\r\nnecessary, since it is far from unusual after working in from 20 to 16\r\nfathoms, to find the water shoal suddenly to four or even three fathoms.\r\nThe anchorage formed by the two islands of Kamorta and Nangkauri has two\r\nentrances, from the east and from the west, the navigation of which by\r\nlarge ships demands the utmost vigilance. The western entrance is barely a\r\ncable's length in width, while the island of Nangkauri has hardly any\r\nfair-way for vessels along its exterior coast-line. In consequence of the\r\ntwo islands trending towards each other at that point, the harbour near\r\nits middle is greatly narrowed, so that there may almost be said to be\r\ntwo harbours. In either of them a vessel is quite safe, being in fact so\r\nthoroughly sheltered from all winds that the heat is occasionally\r\noverpowering.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of Kamorta, six or seven miles north of the western\r\nentrance of the harbour, will be found a large sheet of water, called\r\nUlala Bay, in the first half of which there is excellent anchorage; but\r\nthe vapours emanating from the abundant mangrove swamps render residence\r\nhere extremely unhealthy. As Ulala Cove runs for the most part parallel\r\nwith Nangkauri Harbour, and is separated from the latter only by a range\r\nof low eminences, the near proximity of these mangrove swamps likewise\r\nimparts their baleful influence to the air of Nangkauri Harbour. There is\r\nabsolutely no water here fit for drinking.\r\n\r\nKatchal has large bays on both its west and its east sides, but they are\r\nalmost entirely silted up with coral sand. The channel between Katchal and\r\nKamorta is clear. Here we made short tacks in passing through, approaching\r\nthe shores on either side within half a mile.\r\n\r\nLittle Nicobar has a good harbour on the north side, formed by the island\r\nof Pulo Milu and the N. coast of Little Nicobar, which is bent almost at a\r\nright angle. This anchorage is accessible in all winds, and is well\r\nsheltered, but a considerable portion adjoining the shore of Little\r\nNicobar is rendered useless by banks of coral.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the most careful examination of this part of the coast,\r\nwe could not discover the spot, which in the Danish charts is marked as\r\nfurnishing water fit for drinking, but perceived nothing save mangrove\r\nswamps, with numerous water-courses filled with brackish water, the two\r\nlargest of which we navigated in our gondola as far as was practicable.\r\n\r\nThe island of Kondul in St. George's Channel forms another very fair\r\nanchorage; and similarly on the N. side of Great Nicobar, one finds\r\nseveral suitable bays, the most easterly of which, called Ganges Harbour,\r\nis fringed with coral banks, rendering it proportionately difficult of\r\naccess. The anchorage of Kondul may be selected for one reason, namely,\r\nthat it is land-locked towards both N.E. and S.W., besides having the\r\nadditional advantage of being airy, and distant from the mangrove swamps,\r\nwhereas in the bays on the N. coast of Great Nicobar these are of immense\r\nextent. One of these mangrove swamps in the central cove was traversed by\r\none of the naturalists, the result of which was that he found a river\r\ndebouching into the sea through the very heart of the swamp, which,\r\nhowever, so long as the sea-water could find entrance, was not of course\r\ndrinkable.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of Great Nicobar, along the whole length of which we\r\nsailed, but which we could not visit more carefully, owing to want of time\r\nand the heavy S.W. swell of the ocean, several other promontories and\r\ncoves are apparently available as harbours, and moreover may be supposed\r\nto be the embouchures of rivers. At the south point of Great Nicobar there\r\nis a large bay, which however being quite exposed from S.W. to S.E. must\r\nbe anything but a safe anchorage during the S.W. monsoon. During the\r\nprevalence of the N.E. monsoon it seems tolerably well suited for an\r\nanchorage, if the eastern promontory be kept S.E. by S., and the anchor be\r\ncast in soundings of from 10 to 13 fathoms. Landing, however, is at all\r\ntimes a matter of difficulty, as the surf is very boisterous and the swell\r\nof the sea pretty heavy. Its most remote point is the mouth of the river\r\nGalatea, which, however, is closed by a sand-bar, and for that reason\r\ncannot be easily reached. This bay, owing to its configuration, is\r\nexcessively hot and sweltering, and with reference to its salubrity cannot\r\nbe recommended as a suitable abode.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Archipelago, though tropical, is not nevertheless to be\r\nranked among the hottest, in consequence of its insular position, and of\r\nthe whole of the islands being thickly clothed with forest. Hence the\r\nquantity of rain, which, as has been seen, is sufficient to keep the\r\nrivers full even in the dry season. According to the meteorological\r\nobservations made on these islands by various observers at different\r\nperiods of the year, the average temperature does not exceed 77 deg. Fahr.,\r\nmuch about the temperature of the fluid found in the fresh unripe\r\ncocoa-nut. But during the months of April and October respectively, at\r\nwhich period calms prevail in these islands, the maximum temperature of\r\n86 deg. to 88 deg. Fahr. is reached.\r\n\r\nConsidering the violence with which rain falls, and that the dry season of\r\nthe N.E. monsoon from November to March, and the damp season of the S.W.\r\nmonsoon from April to October, are by no means so sharply defined on these\r\nislands as on the adjoining coasts of the mainland, the quantity of annual\r\nrainfall must be enormous. At certain times it is not much less than 100\r\nor even 150 inches, and yet it probably is not so high as that presented\r\nby other localities, which experience the regular changes of the monsoons,\r\nas for instance, in the Straits of Malacca, where the annual rainfall is\r\n208 inches, or Mahableshwur south of Bombay, where it amounts to no less\r\nthan 254 inches! March is the dryest month in the year. During the whole\r\nof the month, which we spent on the islands or in their immediate\r\nvicinity, we only had three sharp thunder-storms. These become more\r\nfrequent and severe during April, until about May or June the S.W. monsoon\r\nsets in and envelopes the islands in rain-clouds. Where some special\r\nphysical configuration of the soil does not admit of the rapid carrying\r\noff of the redundant deluge of rain, the island must necessarily be\r\nunusually well off for water. Of the correctness of this theory we were\r\nenabled thoroughly to satisfy ourselves, since the close of the dry season\r\nis necessarily unfavourable to there being any water remaining in the\r\nstreams and brooks; notwithstanding which even the smallest of the\r\nislands, Pulo Milu and Kondul, although their rivulets had ceased to flow,\r\npossessed a sufficient supply of sweet drinkable water among the numerous\r\nbasin-shaped pools that occur in the beds of the various streams. From the\r\nforest-covered slopes of Tillangschong also, small streams of fresh water\r\nare continually trickling. The insignificant brooks and rivers of the\r\nlarge well-wooded islands lying further to the south of Great and Little\r\nNicobar, are in like manner kept full the whole year by the blessed\r\nabundance of the watery element. On the other hand, the northern islands,\r\nso far at least as the marl-formation extends, seem to be but scantily\r\nsupplied with water, especially on Kamorta, Nangkauri, Tringkut, and\r\napparently Teressa and Bampoka as well. All the small streams on the two\r\nfirst-named islands, which fall into the Nangkauri harbour, were found to\r\nbe very nearly dried up.\r\n\r\nThe principal beverage of the natives of these islands is the fluid\r\ncontents of the unripe cocoa-nut, while it should seem that they fetch the\r\nwater required for house purposes from the pools of sweet water, which\r\nthey find scattered here and there among the river-courses. Springs we saw\r\nnone, with the exception of the old ruined one of the Moravian Brethren\r\nnear the village of Malacca on the island of Nangkauri. Kar-Nicobar,\r\nalthough likewise belonging to the same marl-formation as the\r\nbefore-mentioned islands, has nevertheless no lack of drinkable water,\r\nsince the expanse of land raised from eight to twelve feet above the level\r\nof the ocean constitutes the site of those singular springs, the sweet\r\nwater in which rises and falls with the ebb and flow of the tide. The\r\nexplanation of this singular phenomenon must not be sought for in the\r\nfiltration of the sea-water by the coral rock, but is simply due to the\r\nrain-water, being the lighter, floating upon the surface of the\r\nsea-water, which is heavier, while the porous coral rock prevents the\r\ncomplete intermixture of the salt and fresh water. In the villages of\r\nMoose and Saoui on Kar-Nicobar we saw several such cisterns, which always\r\nhad eight or ten feet good fresh water. Of rivers, properly so called, we\r\nfound but two, one falling into the northern Bay of Kar-Nicobar, the other\r\nat the southern point of Great Nicobar. The former, which from the\r\nluxuriant growth of the cabbage tree along its banks we named\r\n\"Areca-river,\" is navigable for flat-boats for about two miles from its\r\nmouth, at which point further progress is arrested by some small rapids.\r\nHere the water is quite sweet, holding but a very little chalk in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nWe found no mineral waters or warm springs. The hardened marl deposits of\r\nNangkauri harbour we perceived however to be encased in a crust an inch\r\nthick of sulphate of magnesia, and fine silk-like glistening fibres; this\r\nresults from the clay-marl containing sulphate of magnesia, so that very\r\npossibly by digging cistern-shaped cavities, a bitter saline solution\r\nmight be obtained similar to that at present obtained under similar\r\ncircumstances at Billin in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the extraordinarily rich vegetation, the dampness of the\r\nsoil, and the numerous mangrove swamps all along the coast, the climate,\r\nas may readily be conceived, is at present anything but salubrious. During\r\nthe changes of the monsoons especially, a fever breaks out of so malignant\r\na type that it is very frequently fatal to Europeans.\r\n\r\nBut, so long as dense forest, creeping plants, and swamps encumber the\r\nsoil, there can be no country within the tropics favourable to the health\r\nof man, and all immigrants or other persons who make a sufficiently long\r\nstay in such localities, prepare themselves for being visited by maladies\r\nof the most formidable nature, among which fever and dysentery play the\r\nmost conspicuous part.\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions are occasionally met with in certain parts of Europe\r\nwhere swamp and uncultivated land are exposed to the influences of a high\r\ntemperature, of which examples enough are furnished in the malaria of\r\nItaly, and the marsh fever of the lagoons of Venice and along the coasts\r\nof Istria. And if such visitations make less impression upon us in Europe,\r\nit is not that there is little danger, but simply because, as habit is\r\nsecond nature, the regularity of their return has ceased to attract\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what the English have experienced in the East Indies, it\r\nis what the German emigrant is now going through on the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Ohio, in Brazil and in Peru, until the forests are cleared\r\nand rendered productive, until, in short, advancing cultivation has\r\ndispelled those miasmata, which are inevitably developed amid the\r\nundisturbed voluptuousness of nature.\r\n\r\nWhen at certain seasons of the year the vital principles of millions upon\r\nmillions of organisms begin to be active, they throw off oxygen into the\r\natmosphere, replacing it by absorbing carbonic acid; while, on the other\r\nhand, different organisms, in conformity with known chemical laws, are\r\ndestroyed under similar conditions, and, under the influence of the\r\natmosphere co-operating with humidity, ferment and become decomposed. From\r\nall which processes result products of emanation, which, caught up into\r\nthe atmosphere and whirled away by the wind, become in their turn the\r\nmeans of nutriment and fertilization to other plants, thus imparting to\r\ntropical vegetation that marvellous rankness and super-abundance so fatal\r\nto the human frame. But the conditions which produce this tendency in the\r\natmosphere to generate fever are not peculiar to certain localities, or\r\nstrictly confined to these; they can be averted, and with them the vapours\r\nso prejudicial to health may be removed. We have but to raise up a barrier\r\nagainst that mighty all-devouring process of life and vegetation, which\r\nimperils our own conditions of existence, we have but to withdraw from the\r\npowerful agencies of chemical action the substances undergoing\r\ndecomposition, to constrain the waters of heaven to follow certain\r\ndefinite directions, to drain every swamp, to clear the forest, to sweep\r\naway the dense underwood in order that the wind may wander unchecked over\r\nthe now fertilized soil, and a wondrous alteration will take place in the\r\nclimatic conditions of the Nicobar Islands. Of what may be achieved under\r\nsuch circumstances by energy and perseverance, the island of Penang, some\r\n350 nautical miles distant, furnishes the most striking example, which\r\nwithin a very few decades has, by dint of the progressive clearing and\r\ncultivation of the soil, been converted from a den of fever and malaria,\r\na spot shunned by all men as a residence, into one of the most healthy\r\nlocalities in the East, so much so indeed that it has been made a resort\r\nfor invalids!\r\n\r\nSeduced by the attractive beauty of the harbour of Nangkauri, the various\r\nattempts at founding a settlement have almost without exception been\r\nconfined to that site. Upon a more close examination however of the\r\nprecise spot selected for these settlements, it becomes at once apparent\r\nthat they were for the most part pitched upon the neck of land which\r\ndivides the land-locked ill-ventilated harbour of Nangkauri from the Bay\r\nof Ulala, surrounded as it is on all sides by thick mangrove swamps.\r\n\r\nOn such a site did the settlers erect their huts, and there, often at but\r\na short interval after their arrival, did they find their grave; and if a\r\nvery few of their number resisted the deadly influence of the miasmatic\r\nvapours, if even they were able for several years to drag along a\r\nmiserable existence in such a scene, these can only be regarded as\r\nstriking examples of an unusual vigour of constitution. It is true that\r\nmost of these missionaries who founded settlements here were by no means\r\nproperly housed and fed, which in such a climate is a matter of absolute\r\nprime necessity for the preservation of health. Often when already\r\nattacked with fever they toiled, spade in hand, delving the ground amid\r\nthe exhausting heat of a tropical day in order to secure the means of\r\nsubsistence, or gathered shell-fish along the beach, or hunted for\r\nreptiles or birds through the swamps and forest, in order to provide\r\nthemselves, by the sale of these natural curiosities in Europe, with the\r\nmeans of existence in those distant regions. Not without feelings of the\r\nkeenest emotion and deepest sympathy is it possible to peruse the\r\ndescription given by one of these missionaries, Father Haensel, of his mode\r\nof life on the island of Nangkauri, where he lived for seven years amidst\r\nthe greatest privations and hardships. \"On my frequent excursions along\r\nthe sea-coast,\" says the noble, high-souled missionary, \"it sometimes\r\nhappened that I was benighted, and I could not with convenience return to\r\nour dwelling; but I was never at a loss for a bed. The greater part of the\r\nbeach consists of a remarkably fine white sand, which above high-water\r\nmark is perfectly clean and dry. Into this I dug with ease a hole large\r\nenough to contain my body, forming a mound as a pillow for my head; I then\r\nlay down, and by collecting the sand over me buried myself in it up to the\r\nneck. My faithful dog always laid across my body, ready to give the alarm\r\nin case of disturbance from any quarter. However, I was under no\r\napprehensions from wild animals; crocodiles and caimans never haunt the\r\nopen coast, but keep in creeks and lagoons; and there are no other\r\nravenous beasts on the island. The only annoyance I suffered, was from the\r\nnocturnal perambulations of an immense variety of crabs of all sizes, the\r\ncrackling noise of whose armour would sometimes keep me awake. But they\r\nwere well watched by my dog, and if any one ventured to approach too near,\r\nhe was sure to be suddenly seized and thrown to a more respectful\r\ndistance. Or if a crab of a more tremendous appearance would deter my dog\r\nfrom exposing his nose to its claws, he would bark and frighten it away,\r\nby which however I was sometimes more seriously alarmed than the occasion\r\nrequired. Many a comfortable night's rest have I had in these sepulchral\r\ndormitories when the nights were clear and dry, and the heavens spangled\r\nwith stars.\"[17]\r\n\r\nAfter such a description, one cannot but feel astonished that any of these\r\nmen, jealous for the faith, should have been able to linger on for years\r\nin such a plight, and assuredly no one will refuse to these heroes of\r\nChristianity their meed of the deepest admiration and gratitude, which\r\nthey merit none the less that their labours among these natives were\r\nalmost entirely unattended by any permanent good results.\r\n\r\nIt seems specially worthy of remark that the crew of the Austrian ship\r\n_Joseph and Theresa_, which spent as much as five months here, and that\r\ntoo during the rainy season (April to September), almost entirely escaped\r\nfever. This fact sufficiently proves that the rainy season is by no means\r\nthe most unhealthy, but that the periods of transition from the dry to the\r\nwet season, and _vice versa_, must be considered as invariably\r\nprejudicial. At these times light variable winds alternate with\r\nthunder-showers, after which there is usually experienced great heat by\r\nsolar radiation, which at once liberates the noxious emanations of the\r\nhumid soil. Further on, during the actual rainy season, when the heavens\r\nare almost continually veiled, and the condition of the atmosphere and the\r\nsoil is alike one of complete saturation, this phenomenon appears much\r\nless marked, and becomes in a corresponding degree less dangerous to human\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nWe are also of opinion that the time from the end of March to the end of\r\nApril, as also the months of September and October, are the most\r\ninsalubrious parts of the year, although on the Nicobars a man may be\r\nstruck down with fever at any season, so soon as those precautions have\r\nbeen neglected, which are so necessary to observe in the uncultivated\r\nregions of the tropics. An instance on this point is furnished in the case\r\nof the crew of the Danish corvette _Galatea_. Of thirty individuals\r\nengaged in an exploring expedition up what is known as the Galatea river,\r\nin the southern Bay of Great Nicobar, and caught one night in a\r\nthunder-storm, which compelled them to remain in the forest wringing wet,\r\nno fewer than twenty-one fell ill of fever, which ultimately proved fatal\r\nin four cases.\r\n\r\nSo far as our own experience goes, the state of health on board the\r\nfrigate during a stay of thirty-two days was highly satisfactory. During\r\nthat entire period, out of 350 men only six took ill with fever, which\r\nnumber, however, at a later period during our passage to the straits of\r\nMalacca, was increased to 21. Singular to say, those of the ship's\r\ncompany, who during our stay had _never set foot_ on the Nicobar Islands,\r\nfurnished the largest contingent of cases of fever, while of both officers\r\nand naturalists, who spent the whole day together among the swamps and the\r\nforest, and were exposed to all manner of fatigue, only three got upon the\r\nsick list. On the whole, however, even the few severer cases made an\r\nexcellent recovery, and by the time we had anchored in the harbour of\r\nSingapore, all the fever patients were once more either quite well, or in\r\na fair way towards convalescence.\r\n\r\nAs the examination of this Archipelago was, in consequence of the all but\r\nimpenetrable forests, confined to the narrow strip of land along the\r\nshore, we had almost said to the region of cocoa-palms exclusively, its\r\nvarious geognostic features were very inadequately, yet withal\r\napproximately, ascertained. If we admit that a covering of vegetation of\r\nthe utmost variety and primeval luxuriance, untouched by the hand of man,\r\nand entirely unreclaimed by cultivation, may be considered as the\r\nexpressive feature by which an estimate could be arrived at of the\r\ndifferent geognostic conditions of soil beneath, we may succeed in our\r\nattempt from the characteristics of this primeval vegetation, to come to\r\nsome definite conclusion as to the quality and the greater or lesser\r\nproductiveness of the ground. According to this method of computing, it\r\nwould seem that,\r\n\r\nI. The forest, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, includes 70/100\r\nof the entire surface of the island:--the soil being limestone, rich in\r\nalkalies, spungy, with clay-sand, and exceedingly fertile.\r\n\r\nII. On the other hand, the grass vegetation proper may be set down at\r\n15/100 of the surface: a barren, clay soil.\r\n\r\nIII. The cocoa forest may be estimated at 5/100 of the entire area; upon a\r\nfruitful soil of coral conglomerate, coral sand, and dried alluvium.\r\n\r\nIV. In like manner the screw-pine forests cover 5/100 of the entire\r\ninsular surface, the soil marshy but well suited for cultivation, with\r\nfresh-water bogs, and moist fresh-water alluvium.\r\n\r\nV. Lastly, the mangrove forest in like manner may be roughly estimated at\r\n5/100 of the superficial area, and is a swampy soil, unfitted for\r\ncultivation, consisting of salt-water marshes, and alluvium, moistened by\r\nsalt-water.\r\n\r\nThe entire superficial area of the islands may be computed at about 627\r\nsquare miles. Reckoning only 7/10 therefore of the surface as consisting\r\nof soil suitable for culture, which may undoubtedly be assumed as a fair\r\napproximation, we have a surface of 439 square miles capable of being made\r\nproductive. But even the very ground now exclusively covered with grass,\r\nmight be made productive with a more numerous population and a\r\ncorresponding improvement in cultivation, so that these islands, now the\r\nabode of about 5000 savages, could easily support in comfort a population\r\nof over 100,000 industrious men.\r\n\r\nAt present the chief product of the islands is the cocoa-nut palm, which\r\ngrows for the most part on the sea-shore, so far as the coral sand\r\nreaches. Within the same limits is the existence of the inhabitants\r\nconfined, destitute as they are of industry or the capacity to cultivate\r\nthe soil. This invaluable plant seldom extends far into the interior, and\r\nfrom this circumstance was named by a celebrated German traveller and\r\nbotanist, Martius, the \"Sea-shore palm.\" It is, however, as yet undecided\r\nwhether the cocoa-palm is indigenous to the Nicobar Islands, or whether,\r\ncast on these shores by the waves, it has, by virtue of its well-known\r\nproperty of putting forth shoots even in salt-water, gradually propagated\r\nitself without any assistance from man.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the profit realized by those engaged in the trade in these\r\nnuts, amounts to from 20 to 40 per cent., and could greatly be increased,\r\nif, as for example in Ceylon, oil-presses were erected, by means of which\r\nthe expense of transporting the heavy bulky loads of nuts would be\r\neconomised, the oil being exported direct. On the more northerly islands\r\nthe cocoa forest embraces proportionately a far larger area, those more to\r\nthe south being much less abundantly supplied, especially Greater Nicobar,\r\nwhere there is hardly any. Accordingly the more northerly islands are much\r\nthe more densely peopled, and the cocoa-palms are there subdivided as\r\nproperty, while on the southern islands they seem to be freely enjoyed in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the cocoa-nut palm, as a means of subsistence to\r\nthe inhabitants, is the _Pandanus Melori_, of the family of the Pandaneae,\r\nthe fruit of which (Melori or Caldevia of the Portuguese, the Larohm of\r\nthe natives) supplies the place of rice and Indian corn, neither of which\r\nare grown on the island, owing to the ignorance of the islanders of the\r\nprinciples of cultivation, although the nature of the soil seems eminently\r\nsuited to the production of both. From the huge fruit of this Pandanus, a\r\nspecies of bread is prepared, very similar to apple-marmalade, which is\r\neaten by the natives along with the soft white kernel of the ripe\r\ncocoa-nut. The leaves are prepared as mats of every sort and description,\r\nand are occasionally used for the manufacture of sails.\r\n\r\nThe Bread-fruit tree (_Podocarpus incisa_), which furnishes such excellent\r\nnutriment, that, according to Cook,[18] three trees suffice to support a\r\nman during eight months, is found on the islands in single individuals,\r\nand we never happened to see its fruit used by the natives. The plantain\r\ntoo seemed but sparingly planted, although the elegant leafy green canopy\r\nof this the most important and nutritious plant, after the cocoa-nut,\r\nrequires but little care in cultivation. The sugar-cane, the muscat-nut\r\ntree (_Myristia Moschatea_), and the _Cardamum Elettaria_,[19] grow and\r\nflourish on most of the islands, and orange and lemon trees of the most\r\nstupendous proportions may be met with, growing wild in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the native dwellings.\r\n\r\nOf tubers we only found the yam growing in considerable quantities, but it\r\nseems to be cultivated by the natives more as an article of exchange with\r\nthe ships visiting the islands, than for their own use. So far however as\r\nwe could ascertain the capabilities of the soil, the Jucca (_Jakopha\r\nManihot_), the sweet potato (the _Camote_ of the Spanish colonies), and\r\nother American tuberous roots, might flourish here at least as well as on\r\nthe hot damp coasts of the western continent.\r\n\r\nThe number of plants collected by our botanists throughout this group of\r\nislands, amounts to 280 different species; however by a more thorough\r\nexploration of the Archipelago, the _Phanerogamous_ species may be\r\nincreased one half in number.\r\n\r\nThere are also two plants, which, although they cannot be included among\r\nthe vegetable products suited for the sustenance of man, must nevertheless\r\nbe taken into account as contributing in an important degree to the\r\nsubsistence of the natives. These are the Areca palm, and the Betel shrub.\r\n\r\nThe nut of the _Areca Cateehu_, and the green leaf of the _Piper Betle_,\r\nconstitute as already mentioned, together with coral lime, the chief\r\ningredients of _Betel_, that singular salivatory compound, which has\r\nbecome a prime luxury for the inhabitants of the Indies, and the adjacent\r\nislands. The Areca palm, with its graceful straight stem and elegant tuft\r\nof leaves, is indigenous to the entire group, and is found in considerable\r\nquantities. With the enormous demand for it as a salivatory, as also as an\r\narticle of medicine, it might, had the natives the slightest turn for\r\ncultivation, yield a large profit as an article of commerce. The Betel\r\nshrub is also found in large quantities in these islands, and needs but\r\nlittle looking after.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the forest in ornamental timber, and wood fit for building\r\npurposes, is so great that, if carefully surveyed and judiciously thinned,\r\nthey would not only furnish the settler with cleared soil suitable for\r\ncultivation, but would likewise permit an immense profit to be\r\nrealized.[20]\r\n\r\nThe Nicobar Islands had been recommended by a learned member of the\r\nSociety of Physicians of Vienna, as a special subject of inquiry as to\r\nwhether this group were not by position, conditions of soil, and climate,\r\nparticularly suitable for the cultivation of the Peruvian bark tree, whose\r\nimportance for medical purposes is daily increasing. So far as our brief\r\nstay admitted, we did not lose sight of this object, but the practical\r\nobservations we made in the course of our voyage led us to conclusions\r\nwidely different from those which, representing the quinquina tree as in\r\ndanger of being extirpated on its native soil, South America, by the\r\ncarelessness of the Indians, regarded its transplantation into other\r\ncountries as a question of the utmost importance for the interests of the\r\nhuman race. The China tree, very far from becoming extinct, is carefully\r\ncultivated in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. The bark is systematically\r\ncropped in most of these localities, and consequently there is no occasion\r\nto anticipate any considerable increase in price, or failure in the supply\r\nof this precious drug. We shall have an opportunity, when describing our\r\nstay at Java and at the west coast of America, to revert at length to this\r\nquestion, and shall have only to add the remark, that the great expense of\r\nsuch an attempt, and the extraordinary watchfulness and care which must be\r\nbestowed on the China tree for a number of years before the slightest\r\nprofit can be derived from it, seem alone to render hopeless such an\r\nundertaking as its introduction in the Nicobar Islands, even were the\r\nclimatic conditions better suited to such an experiment than we have\r\nreason to believe that they are.\r\n\r\nAs for the zoology of these islands, it seems to be much less developed,\r\nwhether as regards numbers, or size, than might be expected, considering\r\nthe luxuriance of the vegetation. The forests are by their very nature\r\npoor in living denizens, the majority of these consisting of various\r\nspecies of birds. In like manner the sea is but little productive, and the\r\nnets which we cast over the ship's side at Kar-Nicobar, Pulo Milu, and\r\nGanges Harbour, like the hook and line, brought up but few specimens, and\r\nthose hardly deserving of notice. The natives have no nets of any sort,\r\ntheir mode of fishing consisting simply of raising a succession of weirs,\r\nin which they can harpoon or take their prey.\r\n\r\nOf domestic animals we saw only swine, hens, dogs, and cats, all of which\r\nlive upon cocoa-nut. The dog, a smooth-haired cur of a light\r\nbrownish-yellow colour, with pointed ears, is a sad coward, and his bark\r\nrather resembles a prolonged howl. The cats and the hens are exactly like\r\nthose of Europe. Cattle for draught or the dairy, are as yet entirely\r\nunknown to the natives; yet they might easily be introduced from the\r\nadjoining shores of India. The zebra breed especially, already\r\nacclimatized in the tropics, would be of conspicuous utility as beasts of\r\ndraught, supposing any attempt made at cultivation of the soil.\r\n\r\nJudging by the experiments made at Pulo Milu, the introduction of goats\r\nand sheep could only be accomplished with much difficulty. On the other\r\nhand all manner of poultry would be found to thrive in these islands.\r\n\r\nIn passing from this very cursory consideration of the natural history of\r\nthese islands[21] to the race of man who inhabit them, we find ourselves\r\nconfronted with a people, who, on account of the primitive manner in which\r\nthey live, attract our interest in the highest degree. The natives of the\r\nNicobar group, whose entire number may be estimated at from 5000 to 6000\r\nsouls, are, as we have already remarked, large and well formed, the skin\r\nof a dark brown, bronze-like hue, and owing to the prevailing custom of\r\nanointing their bodies with cocoa-nut oil, usually presenting a glancing\r\nappearance, and emitting a peculiar odour. This inunction is apparently\r\nintended to obviate superabundant perspiration, as also any skin diseases,\r\njust as the Indian races west of the Mississippi are accustomed to protect\r\ntheir naked bodies against the direct influences of the cold, by rubbing\r\nin the fat of animals. The practice of daubing the face does not seem to\r\nbe so extensively resorted to, as previous descriptions of the Nicobar\r\nislanders had led us to believe. We saw only one solitary native, at the\r\nvillage of Malacca in the island of Nangkauri, who had painted his\r\nforehead and cheeks with the red pigment obtained from the seeds of the\r\n_Bixa Orellana_ (the well-known Annatto dye). Instances of tattooing we\r\nnever fell in with, nor do these islanders seem to have any desire to\r\nimitate the beautiful, sometimes absolutely artistic, designs punctured on\r\nthe hands and feet of the Malays and Burmese who occasionally visit them.\r\nMoles and blotches on the breast and arms are of frequent occurrence. The\r\nforehead of the Nicobar islander is slightly rounded, and in many cases\r\nmay even be said to be well formed, but it falls away somewhat suddenly;\r\nthe face is usually broad, and if we except the rather prominent zygomatic\r\nprocess, approaches the oval type; the hinder portion of the head is flat\r\nand seems as though crushed inwards, a circumstance of which Fontana, in\r\nhis well-known journal already mentioned, takes special notice, and which\r\ndeserves the more attention, that we think we are in a position, by means\r\nof actual measurement, and inquiries made on the spot, to say with\r\ncertainty that this modification of the normal form of the skull is not\r\nnatural to this race, but is artificially produced. We especially rely\r\nupon the circumstance, that among the natives of Nangkauri and others of\r\nthe islands, the custom prevails of pressing quite flat the head of the\r\nnewly-born infant, probably in conformity with Nicobar laws of taste and\r\nbeauty: in order to make the result more certain, they keep continually\r\nrepeating this experiment by a variety of different means during a\r\nconsiderable time. The nose is of ordinary dimensions, but is always of\r\nunusual breadth, and coarse of outline; we found a few individuals with\r\nnoses of exorbitant length. Owing to the incredible extent to which the\r\ndisgusting practice of chewing the betel-nut is carried, their mouth,\r\nnaturally large, is hideously distorted. On the island of Treis we saw an\r\naged native, whose tongue, in consequence of the incessant betel-chewing,\r\nhad been attacked in a similar manner as his teeth. The chin is for the\r\nmost part without any marked characteristic, and is usually rather\r\nretreating. The maxillary bones are broad and projecting, and the zygoma\r\nhas a rather bold curve. The ears are small, but the flaps on the other\r\nhand are so broad, that when pierced they are ornamented with a piece of\r\nbamboo an inch thick.\r\n\r\nSome of the natives make use of this broad aperture to store away cigars.\r\nThe thin eye-brows do not curve over the whole of the superior arch of the\r\neye. The hair for the most part is beautiful, thick, black, and soft, in\r\nmany instances depending low on both sides. The beard is universally very\r\nthin, and instances of mustachios or goatees are very rarely encountered.\r\nHowever a beard does not seem to be classed among those objects which add\r\nto the Nicobar ideal of beauty. At least, as often as they found an\r\nopportunity of seizing a pair of scissors from our dressing-cases, we used\r\nalways to see the natives eagerly setting about extirpating the few hairs,\r\nwhich despite all their endeavours would persist in appearing upon the\r\nupper lip on either side of the mouth. The expression of their face is\r\ngrave, tranquil, and rather _insouciant_. We never saw in their features\r\nany expression of emotion, such for instance as might have been imparted\r\nby delight at having obtained some coveted object, not even when they had\r\nmanifested the utmost eagerness to possess it. The only excitement which\r\ntheir ordinarily impassive countenances were however many a time called on\r\nto indicate, took the form of an expression of pain and anxiety, as often\r\nas they saw a number of strangers make a descent upon their islands. The\r\nsingularly marked similarity of feature in each and every individual, may\r\nsafely be ascribed to the similarity of condition universally prevalent,\r\nto the small scope given to the play of their affections, and to the\r\nfrequent intermarriage, which must necessarily be the case where, as in\r\nthese islands, a couple of hundred human beings form the whole population\r\nof an island, and where intercommunication with the adjoining islands is\r\nso confined.\r\n\r\nThe assertion by Fontana, that the natives never cut their nails, but on\r\nthe other hand shave off their eye-brows, we have never found confirmed in\r\nany of the islands we visited, although very possibly some few\r\nindividuals, certainly so far as we could find very scanty in number, may\r\nape the customs of their Malay and Chinese visitors, by letting their\r\nnails grow. Of cripples, or at all events of individuals stunted in their\r\ngrowth, we saw but two, the first case being that of a native of\r\nKar-Nicobar, who in consequence of a dislocation of the _radius_ at the\r\nwrist joint was entirely powerless of the left arm; while the second, a\r\nsort of dwarf, who was likewise an inhabitant of that island, presented a\r\nwell-marked corpulence in the extremities, and fingers so swelled up and\r\nshort, that he was known among his neighbours by the nickname of\r\n_Kiutakunti_ (short finger).\r\n\r\nHitherto the natives seem to have escaped the ravages of syphilitic\r\ndiseases. As to any instances of visitations of virulent though temporary\r\nepidemics, we could not get any information of such having occurred; they\r\nhave however in their language a word (Mallok) for the small-pox, of the\r\nexistence of which we had convinced ourselves by personal demonstration\r\nin the case of a Malay, whose face was frightfully disfigured by the marks\r\nof this appalling disease.\r\n\r\nAlthough in a climate the annual average of which is 81 deg. Fahr., clothes\r\nare all but unnecessary, the natives nevertheless manifest an\r\nextraordinary passion for European clothing, and when it seemed\r\nimpracticable by any other means to elicit an expression of pleasure on\r\ntheir calm, indifferent, emotionless countenances, it was always possible\r\nto succeed by presenting them with a shirt, a coat, or a black silk round\r\nhat. As however the natives have seldom been presented with more than one\r\nsuch article at a time, and many a year is apt to elapse ere he gets\r\nanother, by which he might succeed in gradually completing his dress, the\r\nNicobarian makes his appearance before strangers attired in the most\r\nextraordinary fashion, almost entirely naked, sometimes with only a black\r\nhat on his head, or pluming himself on being spruced up in a frock coat\r\n(but without shirt, stockings, or head-gear), which on the plump naked\r\nbrown skin of this child of nature has far more the appearance of a\r\nstraight-waistcoat than a comfortable article of dress.\r\n\r\nThe natives show infinitely more vanity in the selection of a piece of\r\nclothing, than calculation as to its real necessity or suitability. A\r\nlarge low-crowned white hat with broad rim, which we presented to one\r\nnative, gained not the slightest approval, although both in form and\r\ncolour it was far better suited to protecting the wearer against the rays\r\nof the tropical sun than a high, narrow-brimmed, fashionable black silk\r\nhat, to the possession of which the natives of Kar-Nicobar and Nangkauri\r\nattach quite an inordinate value. For such an article, in the course of\r\nbarter, they offer 1600 ripe cocoa-nuts, while for a long piece of wide\r\ndark-coloured muslin, in which they are wont to envelope their dead, they\r\nwill give only 1200 such fruits. But the most characteristic head-gear of\r\nthe Nicobarians is a bandeau made of dried leaves of the cocoa-nut palm,\r\nwhich gives them quite a picturesque appearance. We saw but few ornaments\r\nworn, such as necklaces, bracelets, &c., only one or two of the younger\r\nmen having their hands and their necks adorned with massive rings of\r\nsilver and iron wire.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings of the natives are usually round, beehive-shaped huts,\r\nresting on a number of stakes of from six to eight feet in height. Simple\r\nas is the construction of these huts, it nevertheless, especially on the\r\nisland of Kar-Nicobar, possesses a certain degree of ornament, we might\r\nalmost say elegance, while the thatching of dried palm-leaves, as also the\r\nbeams and the walls constructed of reeds (_Calamus Rotang_), are a branch\r\nof industry which would do honour even to civilized races of the world.\r\nThe natives usually cower or squat on the ground, or seat themselves upon\r\nsome cocoa-nut that has chanced to fall, while at night, stretched out\r\nupon the flowers shed by the Areca palm, and with their heads elevated by\r\na piece of hard wood, they find anywhere a sufficiently comfortable couch.\r\n\r\nThe means of subsistence of the Nicobar islanders are anything but\r\nabundant. As they are utterly ignorant of cultivation, they are entirely\r\nindebted for the very first necessaries of life to the provision which a\r\nbountiful nature has supplied to them, without the assistance of man's\r\nlabour. Their chief articles of food are the cocoa-nut and the pandanus\r\nfruit. As with the natives of India, so among the natives of the Nicobar\r\ngroup, the cocoa-palm is applied to the most various purposes, although it\r\nwould be difficult to make it fulfil all the ninety and nine useful\r\npurposes which the Hindoo proverb assigns to this noble individual of the\r\nroyal race of palms. The cocoa-palm likewise constitutes the chief article\r\nof export of the entire group, while the profit from the Trepang (Biche de\r\nMar of the English, a sort of cockle), edible swallows' nests,\r\ntortoise-shell, amber, and so forth, is of the highest importance in the\r\ninterchange of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe betel shrub (_Piper Betle_), next to the cocoa-nut and pandanus fruit,\r\none of the most important necessities of the inhabitants of these islands,\r\nis not indigenous, but has been introduced hither from the peninsula of\r\nMalacca, and formed for a long time an article of commerce and exchange.\r\nAt present this creeper, which spreads with hardly any particular care, is\r\nfound in such quantities that only a small proportion of the leafy produce\r\ncan be consumed by the sparse population. It was always incomprehensible\r\nto us in what could consist the great charm of betel-chewing, that a habit\r\nso loathsome should be so extensively practised by the very lowest slaves\r\nof the princes of India, by poor as well as rich, nay, should fling its\r\nchains, as it actually does, even over women and children. A lucky chance,\r\nhowever, threw in our way a Sanscrit poem (_Hytopedesa_) which celebrates\r\nas follows the thirteen cardinal virtues of the betel-leaf:--\"Betel is\r\npungent, bitter, aromatic, sweet, alkaline, astringent, a carminative, a\r\ndispeller of phlegm, a vermifuge, a sweetener of the breath, an ornament\r\nof the mouth, a remover of impurities, and a kindler of the flame of love!\r\nO friend! these thirteen properties of betel are hard to be met with, even\r\nin heaven!\"[22]\r\n\r\nIt would be an inquiry of considerable interest to trace the influence\r\nwhich the incessant betel-chewing exercises over the longevity of the\r\ninhabitants, and the changes caused in the masticatory organs, which are\r\nso constantly exposed to these pernicious practices.\r\n\r\nThat which most deeply struck us throughout the Nicobars, was the\r\nfrightful decomposition of the teeth, whereas in other betel-chewing races\r\nthese were stained only of the same deep crimson as the lips and the gums.\r\nWe at first ascribed this difference to some variation in the mixture of\r\nthe ingredients, but we repeatedly perceived afterwards that the betel\r\nused on the Nicobar group consisted of nothing else than a small piece of\r\nAreca-nut, which, sprinkled with a little chalk, was enveloped in a green\r\naromatic betel-leaf, and so was popped into the mouth. The Hindoos, on\r\nthe other hand, add to these ingredients, which they always carry about\r\nwith them in elegant cases, a certain astringent substance (formerly\r\ncalled _Terra Japonica_, because it was long supposed to be a mineral\r\nproduct) made out of the pith of the _Acacia Catechu_, a species of\r\nMimosa; or occasionally add to the usual masticatory composition a species\r\nof resin obtained from the _Melaleuca Cajeputi_, as also a little tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe frightfully destructive effects of the betel on the teeth and lips of\r\nthe Nicobar natives, is apparently attributable only to some difference in\r\nthe proportions of the ingredients used, very probably to the use of a\r\nlarger quantity of coral lime. What is alleged of a custom the Nicobarians\r\nhave of filing down their teeth and rubbing them with some corrosive\r\nsubstance, rests exclusively upon conjecture, and is confirmed neither by\r\npersonal observation nor by the account given by the natives themselves,\r\nnor by the Malay traders who frequent Great Nicobar and Nangkauri.\r\n\r\nIn social as well as in religious matters, we must consider the\r\ninhabitants of this Archipelago as among the child-races of the world.\r\nThey consider it a duty to marry very young and take but one wife, but\r\nthey age with uncommon rapidity. Of about 100 natives with whom during our\r\nstay on the various islands we were in communication, hardly one was above\r\nforty, and the majority may be roughly estimated at from twenty to thirty.\r\nIf, moreover, we set it down as improbable that all the aged men should\r\nhave taken to flight like the women and children, it should seem that\r\nthese natives never attain a very extended duration of life.\r\n\r\nOf the therapeutic powers of various plants that are found in their\r\nforests, the natives have but little knowledge. All that they have ever\r\nhad of drugs have been almost entirely supplied from Europe by captains of\r\nEnglish vessels. Although they attach the most extravagant importance to\r\nthe possession of these, these medicines are, if anything, more\r\nprejudicial than beneficial to them, as they of course understand nothing\r\nof their use, and often apply them in the most absurd manner. It seems\r\nthat once some ship captain in order to get quit of their importunities\r\nmade over to them all the articles he could most conveniently spare, such\r\nas castor-oil, Epsom salts, spirit of camphor, turpentine, peppermint, eau\r\nde Cologne, &c. &c., and ever since they pester each visitor for medicine!\r\nA native once urgently begged us to give him a little spirit of\r\nturpentine; on our asking him to what purpose he wished to apply it, he\r\nanswered that he wanted to rub himself with it, and take a few drops\r\ninternally, because he believed it was an excellent preservative against\r\nague and pain in the chest!\r\n\r\nThe maladies with which the natives are most commonly afflicted, are\r\nintermittent fever, phthisis, and rheumatism. In some cases we remarked\r\n_Elephantiasis Arabica_ (the Juzam of Arab writers), called by the\r\nNicobarians _Kelloidy_, attacking the bones, and several different forms\r\nof cuticular eruption. The severity of these diseases must be ascribed\r\nless to the insalubrity of the climate than to the unwholesome mode of\r\nexistence of the natives. Can we feel surprised that naked men, who do not\r\ninhabit the more favourably situated spots ventilated by regular winds,\r\nbut live on the swampy coast, in the sandy bays that are fringed with a\r\nforest belt, where they can grow their cocoa-palms with the least labour\r\nto themselves, who leave their bodies exposed now to the violence of\r\ntropical rains, now to the fiery rays of a tropical sun, and whose food\r\nconsists almost exclusively of cocoa-nuts and the fruit of the\r\n_pandanus_,--can we wonder that they should be in an especial degree\r\nsubject to disease? It is a mistake to suppose that the food of\r\ninhabitants of the tropics is that assigned by Nature herself, and\r\ntherefore the most beneficial and suitable. For, despite all theory, which\r\nfor residents in the tropics chiefly prescribes substances with plenty of\r\ncarbon and nitrogen as the proper articles of food, we see Europeans, more\r\nespecially Englishmen, in the hottest climate in the world, with a\r\nthermometer that rarely falls below 86 deg. Fahr., devouring, just as in a\r\nmore northern climate, strong soups, gigantic beef-steaks, and mutton\r\ncutlets to any extent, contemptuously turning up their noses at mere\r\nvegetable diet, and barely touching marmalade or sweetmeats; yet there\r\nthey are blooming in the best of health, far better even than that of the\r\nnatives. Indeed, it is a fact full of interest, and confirmed by\r\nobservations carried on for years, that in the Presidency of Madras, for\r\nexample, the Hindoos and Mahmudas, so widely different in their customs\r\nand mode of life, were much more seriously attacked by fever than the\r\nEuropeans resident there, in such entirely different conditions of climate\r\nthan they were accustomed to. On the other hand, so far as regards\r\nsanitary measures, that portion of the aboriginal population presents the\r\nmost favourable results which is most intimately allied to the Europeans,\r\nand applies in its own case the precepts of modern civilization.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the natives are attacked by fever with any severity, they\r\nrapidly succumb. However, we have never heard tell of any of that\r\nbarbarous inhumanity which any medicine-man, whose treatment is\r\nunsuccessful, is said to experience at the hands of the relatives and\r\nfriends of the patient, which indeed is all the more improbable as, were\r\nsuch really the case, considering the small advantages and scrimp fees\r\nlikely to be picked up by a smart medicine-man among such an impoverished\r\nrace, there would hardly be met with one Manluena in the entire group! The\r\nhead-mark of a doctor in the southern islands is his unusually long\r\nfloating hair. On our inquiring of a native what qualifications were\r\nrequisite in order to become a doctor, he replied with the most charming\r\nnaivete: \"One must be the son of a doctor!\" From this reply we may gather\r\nthat in the Nicobar Islands medical skill and knowledge of the healing art\r\nare confined to certain families! We afterwards found this information\r\nconfirmed, upon our discovering that the youthful Manluena of Great\r\nNicobar, who so severely kneaded and twisted the arm of one of the\r\nassociates of the Expedition, was the son of an aged doctor of the island\r\nof Kondul, and owed his reputation solely to the circumstance of his\r\nkindred. Besides cases of sickness, the advice, the adroitness, and the\r\nzeal of the Manluena are held in special repute for the driving out of the\r\nevil spirit or _Eewees_, by which, as already mentioned, the inhabitants\r\nof the Nicobar Islands believe themselves to be incessantly surrounded.\r\n\r\nOf idols proper, such as barbarous tribes construct and honour, and to\r\nwhom they dedicate temples, they have none; nor have they any object in\r\nnature, as, for instance, a lofty tree, a huge rock or a hill, to which\r\nthey attach a certain charm, like some of the Central American tribes.\r\nThey have not even a word for the Divine idea in their language, nor for\r\nGodhead, nor for any Beneficent Principle or Being, and the rudely carved\r\nfigures, which are found set up in all sorts of comical postures within\r\ntheir huts, are intended to serve no higher purpose, than to frighten away\r\nthose evil spirits which even the Manluena has been unable to see, though\r\nhe sets himself forward as able to hold converse with them.\r\n\r\nThe notion of a Being, whose wisdom and whose love rule the world, is\r\nquite as foreign to their minds as the conception of a spiritual life in\r\nthe future after death. We repeatedly asked one of their most intelligent\r\nleaders, who also spoke a little English, whether he believed he should\r\never again recognize his dead friends and relatives? But he replied\r\ninvariably with a cold, indifferent, \"Never, never!\" All that we told them\r\nof the privileges of a believing Christian, of a Divine Being, of the\r\nbelief in a future state of existence after death, served only to fill\r\nthem with astonishment, but they seemed ready enough to listen to such\r\nsubjects. What little they had heard upon these truths from missionaries\r\nand ship captains, appeared however to have left them with very confused\r\nnotions.\r\n\r\nFrom all that came under our notice, the mode of life of these islanders\r\nis singularly uniform and indolent, its most important events consisting\r\nprobably of the alterations necessary by the interchange of the seasons.\r\nThey know of no other method of computing time than the change of the moon\r\nand of the monsoons. At the beginning of the wet season or S.W. monsoon,\r\nand at the corresponding period of the dry season or N.E. monsoon, there\r\nare certain festivals, which somewhat resemble the \"sowing feasts\" and\r\n\"harvest homes\" of the American aboriginal stocks. They have however no\r\nappointed day of rest, corresponding to the sabbath of the Christian\r\nChurch, nor indeed do they need such, seeing that in their mode of life\r\nevery day is a holiday! They have no measure for time, nor indeed for\r\nanything else: not a single native could give us any idea of his own age,\r\nnor could count above 20.[23] Time has for them not the slightest value:\r\nthe watchword \"_Time is money!_\" which first given by England, is at\r\npresent resounding throughout the world, falls voiceless and ineffectual\r\non their insensible ears. Their reckoning of time is as limited as their\r\ncapacity for recollecting by-gone occurrences. The presence of Christian\r\nmissionaries at various periods, as also the visit of the Danish corvette\r\n_Galatea_ in 1847, had already almost entirely disappeared from their\r\nmemory. Only among a very few of their numbers have some of the names\r\nclung to the recollection, such as _Galatea_, and _Steene Bille_ (which\r\nthey pronounced _Piller_).\r\n\r\nWe could not find anything that bore the least resemblance to any settled\r\nform of government, to any distribution upon fixed principles of the\r\npossessions of the general community, to any recognition of individual\r\nright, to any tribunal for settling quarrels, &c. &c. They recognize the\r\nrelations of family and of property; on the other hand, the power of the\r\ncaptain, one of whom the greater number of villages has each for itself,\r\nand whom they call _Mah_ or _Umiaha_ (old), extends no further than giving\r\nhim the right to be the first to trade with such foreign ships as make\r\ntheir appearance, and to inaugurate the barter-system. Indeed this very\r\ninstitution of captainship, although much liked by the natives, does not\r\nat all seem as though it were part of their own system, but to date from\r\nthe period when English merchant vessels began to visit these islands\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\nAs to the social life of the natives, their family relations, and so\r\nforth, we could get such scanty and uncertain data to go upon, what with\r\nthe cursory visits we paid to the various islands, and considering the\r\nwomen and children had everywhere fled, while the men regarded us simply\r\nas intruders, that we do not venture to publish any special information\r\nupon this point. Be it however permitted to express our opinion, that,\r\njudging by the tendency to a decent style of dress and the extreme\r\nelegance of the decorations of the canoes and the huts of the islanders of\r\nKar-Nicobar, as contrasted with the destitution, nakedness, and wretched\r\ncondition of the natives of the southern islands of the group,\r\ncivilization seems to be advancing from north to south with slow but sure\r\nsteps. And it will probably interest the philologist to be informed that\r\nboth in Kar-Nicobar and Nangkauri, the most important settlement bears the\r\nsame name, Malacca, as the chief city on the adjoining Malay peninsula. As\r\nthe natives in this delicious _far niente_ existence live exclusively upon\r\nthe precious gifts of an all-bountiful Nature, which provides them at once\r\nwith food and drink, one naturally finds among them few implements of\r\nlabour, indeed only such as are indispensably necessary in erecting their\r\nhuts, in preparing their canoes, and in enabling them readily to open the\r\ncocoa-nuts. And even these tools, as, for instance, hatchets, cutlasses,\r\nfiles, &c., were first procured through intercourse with civilization.\r\n\r\nTheir weapons consist merely of lances or javelins with points of iron or\r\nhardened wood, by the number of which, it is presumed, the wealth of a\r\nNicobar islander is estimated. A cross-bow, which we saw in the possession\r\nof a native of Kar-Nicobar, although made on the island, was manifestly of\r\nEuropean design originally, and merely an imitation.\r\n\r\nOf musical instruments we did not find a single specimen in Kar-Nicobar,\r\nwhereas on the southern islands there is a six, sometimes a seven-holed\r\nflute in use, made of bamboo-cane, which, as we afterwards discovered, had\r\nbeen brought hither by the Malays; and also a kind of guitar about two or\r\nthree feet in length, hollowed out, and with sound-holes in the side, and\r\nmade of thick bamboo and reed strings. On the whole, however, the\r\nNicobarians seem to be much too apathetic and indifferent a race to have\r\nany special predilection for music, singing, or dancing. Accordingly at\r\ntheir monsoon festivals and other holiday-times, their notion of dancing\r\nis limited to hopping round in a circle with arms entwined, while they at\r\nthe same time keep up a listless humming noise.\r\n\r\nIn the case of such a race, which has no civilization or industry of its\r\nown, it is out of the question to speak of their having any regular\r\nindustrial occupation in the strict sense of the word. The particular and\r\nto them most beneficent plant, which supplies them at once with enough to\r\neat and to drink, at the same time brings them, very reluctantly, into\r\ncontact with civilization, and will yet become a main agent in introducing\r\na knowledge of those necessities and acquaintance with those articles\r\nwhich are the product of a higher grade of civilization alone. The ripe\r\nnuts of the cocoa-palm constitute the chief article of export of the\r\nNicobar Islands, and, what is even more important, supply the stimulus,\r\nwhich already arouses the native to a certain degree of activity, although\r\nmost of the nuts that are put on ship-board are collected not by the\r\nnatives, but by the crews of the Malay vessels. All other articles of\r\nexport, such as _Biche de mar_, edible birds' nests, tortoise-shell,\r\namber, &c., are of very inferior importance, and are only taken as\r\nby-freight. According to published documents the northern islands can\r\nsupply 10,000,000 cocoa-nuts, of which however, at present, not much more\r\nthan 5,000,000, to wit, 3,000,000 from Kar-Nicobar alone, and 2,000,000\r\nfrom the rest of the islands, are exported in all. As this fruit is\r\none-sixth of the price it bears on the coasts of Bengal, the concourse of\r\nEnglish and Malay vessels, especially from Pulo Penang, increases every\r\nyear.[24] The trade is carried on by way of barter instead of money\r\npayments, although silver is highly valued too; for here also, despite all\r\nthat is reported of the inordinate longing of the Nicobar natives for\r\ntobacco, glass beads, and such like rubbish, the truth of the adage is\r\nfully borne out that \"Money is the most _universal merchandise_.\" Of\r\nsilver coins, the natives are only acquainted with rupees, Spanish\r\ndollars, and English threepenny pieces, which latter they call \"small\r\nrupees.\" Gold is as yet unknown among the southern islands, and therefore\r\nis valueless in the eyes of the natives.\r\n\r\nSo long as the relations of the natives with foreign nations were\r\nexclusively confined to barter with some couple of dozen English and Malay\r\nvessels, which latter visited the islands with the N.E. monsoon and left\r\nwith the S.W. monsoon, thus making but one voyage in the course of the\r\nyear, the natives of the various islands kept up among themselves quite a\r\nfrequent and regular communication. This favourable trait was undoubtedly\r\nowing in great measure to the defectiveness of their otherwise very\r\nelegant, but small, slight-built canoes, which are but ill adapted for\r\nvoyaging to any remote distance.\r\n\r\nRespecting that other swarthy, crisp-haired, savage race, widely different\r\nfrom that inhabiting the coasts of Nicobar, which, according to a legend,\r\ndwells in the forests of Great Nicobar, and lives upon snakes, vermin,\r\nroots, and leaves of plants, and in the Nicobar idiom called\r\n_Baju-oal-Tschua_, we could only add to our stock of information by\r\nrecitals that obviously pertained to the domain of Fable-land. When,\r\nhowever, we remember that not a single traveller or author who has\r\nindulged such gossiping, nay, that not even the natives who tell such\r\nstories of them, have ever seen one of this race, we shall be excused for\r\nsuggesting in reply to the numberless conjectures afloat respecting these\r\nmysterious inhabitants, that the alleged denizens of the interior of Great\r\nNicobar are neither a widely different race of men from the coast-natives,\r\nnor yet an offshoot of the crisp-haired swarthy race of Papuas from New\r\nGuinea, but that, dispossessed and degraded by a conjuncture of various\r\nhostile influences, they hold, with respect to the inhabitants of the\r\nsea-board, a similar position to that occupied by the Bushmen of\r\nNamaqualand to the Hottentots of Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances in which the inhabitants of this group of islands at\r\npresent find themselves, without traditions, without proverbs, without\r\nsongs, without monuments, and especially without any characteristic\r\npeculiarity in their habits and customs which could possibly throw a ray\r\nof light upon the obscurity of their origin, it is a bold undertaking to\r\nexpress any decided opinion as to the derivation and genealogy of this\r\npeople. By far the most probable theory, as is also admitted by Dr. Rink,\r\nwho visited these islands with the Danish Expedition, would represent them\r\nas an offshoot from the north-westerly boundary of the Malay race, as a\r\npeople which, while possessing much in common with the Indo-Chinese stock,\r\nnevertheless in its physical characteristics seems to hold a middle rank\r\nbetween the Malay and the Burmese.\r\n\r\nConsidering the study _of language_ as a most important and reliable\r\nsource of information, the members of the Expedition made it their main\r\nobject to draw up, in conformity with what is known as Gallatin's method,\r\nso extensively used by all American and English travellers, a vocabulary\r\nof about 200 words in both languages, viz. that used by the inhabitants of\r\nNicobar, and that (widely different in all respects except the numerals)\r\nin use among the natives of the more southern islands. As a Malay barque\r\nfrom Pulo Penang was lying at anchor during our stay on the northern\r\nshores of Great Nicobar, so favourable an opportunity was of course made\r\nuse of to prepare a similar vocabulary of the Malay idiom spoken at that\r\nport, which will give the philologist the advantage of being able to judge\r\nfor himself as to the similarity existing between these two idioms, and\r\nthence, by analogy, between the two races, and discriminate whether those\r\nscholars, such as Vatu, come nearer the truth who maintain that the\r\nNicobar language is of Malay derivation with an admixture of foreign\r\nwords, principally European, or those other students of philology who, as\r\nfor instance Adelung, hold that the idiom used by these islanders is\r\nidentical with some of the languages of the Indo-Chinese peninsula.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the ethnographer of the Expedition had endeavoured to\r\nascertain by means of a new system of measurements of the human frame,\r\ndrawn up by himself in concert with Dr. Edward Schwarz, one of the\r\nphysicians of the Expedition, and with the co-operation and assistance of\r\nthe latter, various data, such as, when applied to the various races\r\ninhabiting the earth, might justify many new and striking conclusions, and\r\nultimately result in definitely fixing the relation, resemblance, or\r\nphysical dissimilarity of the various races of man. Such a plan makes it\r\nmuch more easy by means of figures, those most undeniable evidences of the\r\nresults of investigations, to get speedily and accurately at the required\r\nresults, than by all the most specious theories laid down in the less\r\ncertain domain of philosophic speculation.\r\n\r\nThese measurements, applied at three chief regions of the body, namely,\r\nthe head, the trunk, and the upper and lower extremities, are intended to\r\nbe scientifically discussed in a special memoir,[25] and we accordingly\r\nconfine ourselves here to remarking that the various points of\r\nmeasurements were not only determined in an anthropological point of view,\r\nbut that among the 68 different categories, into which these measurements\r\nare naturally distributed, there occur some which supply many curious\r\npoints of inquiry, as also considerable assistance not merely to national\r\neconomics, the result of the light thrown upon the subject of the average\r\nof muscular strength of the various races as found by the dynamometer, but\r\nalso to the graphic art, with respect to a more accurate acquaintance with\r\nthe human skeleton as well as the entire figure.\r\n\r\nIn like manner we never omitted to collect some of the hair of the head\r\nfrom as many as possible of the various individuals measured, since the\r\nlaborious researches of Peter Brown of Philadelphia on the human hair,\r\nhave elevated it into a very remarkable means of tracing the origin of the\r\nvarious disparities of race.\r\n\r\nIt must also be considered as an especial boon for the science of\r\ncomparative anatomy, as well as universal ethnography, that we succeeded\r\nin bringing away with us from the Nicobar Islands the skulls of two of the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nLastly, a small collection of twenty-three subjects of ethnographical\r\ninquiry, collected from the various islands, will be found useful, partly\r\nas illustrating the information already obtained, partly as affording\r\nevidence of the amount of culture of the inhabitants of the Nicobar\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nWe are still called upon to answer the question already propounded,\r\nwhether the Nicobar Islands are suited as the site of a colony, and\r\nwhether the numerous attempts already made in this direction did not\r\nprobably fall through for other reasons than those of climate.\r\n\r\nAccording to inquiries instituted by the members of the Austrian\r\nExpedition, this insular group, by its geographical position in one of the\r\nvery chiefest commercial routes of the world, and by the richness and\r\nabundance of the products of its soil, offers sufficient points of\r\nattraction to interest any leading commercial or maritime power, in\r\nsecuring possession of it. With regard to any colonization or cultivation\r\nof the soil by free European immigrants, there is as little to be said as\r\nof almost any other islands in the tropics. In order to make such spots\r\naids to the extension of civilization, the utmost certainty of rule is\r\nimperatively necessary, such as was instituted with such marvellous\r\nresults by England in Pulo Penang, Singapore, Sydney, &c. The climate of\r\nthe Nicobars is very far from being so deadly, that mere residence upon\r\nthem must speedily prove fatal to Europeans, and it will undoubtedly be\r\nsignally ameliorated by a partial clearing of the forests, cultivation of\r\nthe soil, channelling of the rivers, and drainage of the swamps. All such\r\nworks however must be executed by Malay or Indian labourers, under the\r\nsuperintendence of Europeans. From what we have learned by personal\r\nobservation of the surprising influence which the transportation system\r\nhas exercised in Australia upon the cultivation and development of the\r\nsoil, as also upon the social condition of the convicts themselves, we do\r\nnot hesitate, despite the distrust of experiments of such a nature which\r\nprevails in certain philosophic circles of Europe, to express our opinion,\r\nthat with a little prudence and forbearance convict labourers in abundance\r\ncould be imported, who would be at once better off, more contented, and\r\nmore disposed to do honour to their man's estate than as at present\r\nconfined at home in their dreary prison cells.[26]\r\n\r\nIf the various experiments hitherto made have all fallen through, the\r\n\"effect defective\" undoubtedly arises from the deficiency of means\r\nrequisite for such an undertaking, and in the limited number of men,\r\nmerely humanly speaking, who were engaged in such enterprises. The mere\r\nprime cost of clearing and cultivation, so as to enable them to anticipate\r\na good return for their labour, must be set down as at the lowest\r\ncomputation between L100,000 and L150,000; the number of labourers\r\nemployed in the undertaking at from 300 to 400; of whom all skilled\r\nartisans, such as carpenters, joiners, locksmiths, blacksmiths,\r\nbricklayers, masons, &c., must accompany the settlers from Europe.\r\n\r\nThe sums expended for the first outlay must not however be set down as\r\nentirely thrown away, since the fertility of the islands in those\r\ncolonial products that are most valuable, and the enormous quantity of\r\ncocoa-nut palms, must, under the impulse of cultivation and industrious\r\nhabits, speedily make returns in countless tides of prosperity. So far as\r\nregards the aboriginal population, of whom there are not above 5000 or\r\n6000 on all the islands, they would experience but little annoyance from\r\nthe carrying out of such an enterprise. In fact, morally and materially\r\nthey could only gain from the introduction of a foreign element. At\r\npresent they are confined to the narrow belt of shore, where grows the\r\ncocoa-palm, their sole support. The interior of the island, so prolific in\r\nnatural wealth of the most varied description, and which would become\r\ninfinitely more valuable under a proper development of its capabilities,\r\nis utterly unknown and valueless to the native.\r\n\r\nOnce a settlement were fairly set a-going on the above-mentioned\r\nprinciples, the inhabitants of the Nicobar Archipelago would be placed\r\nunder the tutelage of European civilization, and in their transactions\r\nwould no longer be exposed to the knavery and caprices of ships' captains.\r\nIt would be necessary to watch over the natives as over minors, so as not\r\nalone to secure for them material benefits, but by liberal sympathetic\r\ntreatment as the groundwork of their education, gradually to establish\r\nthat faith whose introduction hitherto, despite numerous praiseworthy\r\nendeavours in the past as well as the present century, has been doomed to\r\nbe unsuccessful through a variety of extraneous circumstances. Moreover,\r\nthe Nicobar Archipelago would be a most convenient central station whence\r\nto impart the blessings of Christianity to the pagans of the adjoining\r\ngroups of islands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nRelating to those points of the Nicobar Archipelago whose geographical\r\nposition was ascertained by the _Novara_ Expedition.\r\n\r\n  +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\r\n  |   PLACE OF   | Latitude North. | Longitude East  |\r\n  | OBSERVATION. |                 | from Greenwich. |\r\n  +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\r\n  | Saui Cove    |   9 deg. 14' 8''|  92 deg. 44' 46''   |\r\n  | Komios       |   9   7  32     |  92  43  42     |\r\n  | Morrock Bay  |   8  32  30     |  93  34  10     |\r\n  | Kaulaha      |   8   2  10     |  93  29  40     |\r\n  | Kondul       |   7  12  17     |  93  39  57     |\r\n  | Galatea Cove |   6  48  26     |  93  49  51     |\r\n  +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nA very careful measurement, made at the point of observation in Saui, of\r\nthe Moon's distance from Jupiter, gave 6 h. 11 min. 2 sec., or 92 deg. 45'\r\n30'' East.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur voyage from the south side of Great Nicobar to Singapore occupied\r\ntwenty days. This time the fine weather seemed to have entirely abandoned\r\nus. Day and night, at almost all hours and from all parts of the sky, we\r\nencountered severe thunder-storms, with water-spouts, lightning, thunder,\r\nand the most tremendous rain-squalls. We could thoroughly realize that we\r\nwere in the tropics at the beginning of the rainy season. One day during\r\nthe prevalence of one of those floods, five tons during the first half\r\nhour, and in the course of an hour and a half eight tons, or 32,000 pints\r\nof water, were collected by the sailors in buckets and other similar\r\nutensils. These storms came now from the coast of Sumatra, now from the\r\nMalay peninsula, or yet again from the Straits of Malacca, and gave our\r\njolly tars not a moment of repose. These tempests alternated with calms\r\naccompanied by a most oppressive sweltering hot temperature, and if by\r\nchance a breeze sprang up, it was sure to come out of the straits dead\r\nagainst us, and, coupled with the strong contrary current, fairly arrested\r\nour progress. Thus tacking about for 14 days between the north shore of\r\nSumatra and Junk-Ceylon, we made as much way in that time as a fast\r\nsteamer would have done in as many hours, and it was but poor consolation\r\nto us that several ships close to us, perhaps six or eight, shared the\r\nsame adverse destiny.\r\n\r\nAn incident of a very singular nature suddenly gave us all plenty of\r\nexcitement. As our deeply respected chaplain was sitting reading one\r\nevening in his cabin, he became sensible of a peculiar pressure on his\r\nfoot; the servant being called, made his appearance with a candle, and on\r\nexamining the floor was horror-struck at perceiving a pretty large\r\nsea-snake (_Chorsydrus fasciatus_), coiled round the foot of the priest.\r\nIn the same instant this gentleman instinctively rid himself of the\r\npoisonous reptile by a vigorous kick, while the various persons who\r\nhurried to the spot were resolved they would secure this dangerous\r\nassailant dead or alive. Within the narrow limits of a ship's state-room,\r\na campaign is speedily brought to a close. His snakeship was forthwith\r\nrouted out of his asylum, and hacked into more pieces than was exactly\r\nagreeable to the zoologists, who had been extremely anxious, and even\r\nexpected, to preserve this now doubly interesting reptile almost uninjured\r\nin spirits of wine. It was a tolerably large specimen, one inch thick, and\r\nabout three feet long, and had apparently either wriggled up the cable, or\r\nhad been washed on board by a wave through the open sky-light of the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nAt length on the 9th of April wind and weather changed, and, in company\r\nwith the entire squadron of companions in misfortune, we sailed gaily into\r\nthe Straits of Malacca, with all sail set, and dead before the wind. On\r\nthe 11th of April, early in the morning, we found Pulo Penang (also called\r\nAreca, or Prince of Wales' Island) lying broad on our port beam. Its\r\nchains of forest-clad mountains, gloomy, and overcast with dense masses of\r\ncloud, prevented our realizing the charms of this possession of England,\r\nsuch as they have been described by all who have visited it.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of April we steered between the Sambelongs, or Nine Islands,\r\nand the island of Djara, and caught a glimpse of the lofty well-wooded\r\nmountains of the kingdom of Perah. The channel through these straits is\r\nbecoming more and more contracted owing to the _debouche_ at this point of\r\nthe river Perah. Shallow sand-banks and small rocky islands impede the\r\nnavigation, and it is a common precaution for ships to cast anchor at the\r\nleast approach of foul weather, an operation which is the more readily set\r\nabout that the water is nowhere above twenty fathoms, but good holding\r\nground throughout the straits. Moreover, the charts of these regions are\r\nthoroughly reliable and accurate, while at the most dangerous spot, where\r\na sand-bank with only one fathom of water over it lies right in the tracks\r\nof vessels, a light-ship is moored, which we passed on the 13th of April,\r\nand continued our voyage through the night in perfect safety.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th April, the hill of Ophir (called also Ledang or\r\nPudang), 5700 feet high, lay fair before us. We now found ourselves\r\nopposite the town of Malacca. The channel at this point approaches so\r\nclose to the mainland, that we could easily distinguish churches and\r\nhouses, and the frigate exchanged signals with the neighbouring semaphore.\r\n\r\nMalacca, once the Malay capital, has at present altogether lost its former\r\nimportance, and of the three English colonies in the Straits of Malacca,\r\nusually known as the _Straits Settlements_, is the least important in\r\neither a political or a commercial sense. The entire region was, until\r\nwithin these few years, in most evil repute for the atrocious piracies\r\nperpetrated here. Natives used to lie in wait in small canoes filled with\r\nmerchandise of all sorts, with which they boarded the passing ships, and\r\nwhile these were supplying themselves with fruit and fresh provisions, the\r\nformer were spying the number of crew, as also the means of defence of the\r\nunfortunate vessel; after which it usually happened, that during the night\r\nthe more defenceless of them, while becalmed or lying at anchor, would be\r\nattacked by an overwhelming force of pirates and ruthlessly plundered.\r\nCaptain Steen Bille relates, that even so late as 1846, he loaded his\r\ncannon with shot, and maintained extra vigilance during the night.\r\n\r\nWe now sped along, still favoured by the wind, during the ensuing night,\r\nand on the morning of the 15th April had the satisfaction of reaching the\r\nentrance of the bay of Singapore, without once having to lie at anchor in\r\nthe straits. The landscape that lay outstretched before us was\r\nsplendid,--lofty wooded islands on the coast of Sumatra, and a whole\r\narchipelago of islets lay around us, in the channels between which prahus\r\nwere sailing about, while Chinese junks, full-rigged ships and barques,\r\nwere working in or out as the case might be, all intimating the proximity\r\nof a great mart of commerce. Equally fortunate as in the straits was our\r\npassage through the labyrinth of islands, through which a vessel must wind\r\nin order to reach Singapore. And this roadstead itself, what a contrast it\r\npresented to the lovely beach of the Nicobar Islands! Here were thousands\r\nof ships of all sizes and rigs, and the flags of nearly all sea-faring\r\nnations in the world. We found at anchor the English frigate _Amethyst_,\r\nand the screw corvette _Niger_; and having warped ourselves into their\r\nvicinity, by 2 P.M. we had cast anchor in 13 fathoms water. Almost\r\nimmediately afterwards an officer came off from the _Amethyst_ to welcome\r\nus, and to impart to us the unpleasant intelligence that cholera had been\r\nraging in the city for some weeks past, and had also committed great havoc\r\namong the shipping in harbour. Even the captain and one of the crew of an\r\nEnglish merchantman had succumbed but a few hours previously to this fell\r\nscourge, and the vessel had her flag half-mast high as a signal of\r\nmourning. This information at once deranged all our plans and projects\r\nwith respect to Singapore, and had we not been compelled to victual here,\r\nwe should at once have set sail. However, under the circumstances there\r\nwas nothing to do but to spend five or six days at Singapore, and this\r\nbreathing-space we availed ourselves of to obtain as much information as\r\npossible both by eye and ear touching this very remarkable colony, and its\r\nnot less interesting inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Anciennes relations des Indes et de la Chine de deux voyageurs\r\nMahometans, qui y allerent dans le IXeme siecle.

Further, he\r\npublished a \"_Recueil des pieces authentiques relatives aux affaires de la\r\nci-devant societe Imperiale-Asiatique de Trieste, gerees a Anvers_,\" which\r\nappeared in 4to (116 pages) at Paris, in 1787.\r\n\r\n[7] The results of this voyage of discovery are embodied partly in a work\r\nin two volumes: \"Steen Bille's account of the voyage of the corvette\r\n_Galatea_, round the world\" (Copenhagen, Leipzig, 1852), partly in a\r\nGeographical sketch of the Nicobar Islands, with special remarks upon\r\nGeology, by Dr. H. Rink (Copenhagen, 1847): there will be likewise found\r\nin the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, under the heading\r\n\"Nicobar Islands,\" and at p. 261 of the third volume of the \"Journal of\r\nthe Indian Archipelago,\" under the title \"Sketches at the Nicobars,\" a\r\nvariety of valuable contributions to our stock of knowledge respecting\r\nthis island group. In addition, Mr. A. E. Zhishmann, Professor in the\r\nImperial Royal Academy of Commerce and Navigation at Trieste, published,\r\nin anticipation of the projected visit of the _Novara_ to this\r\nArchipelago, a valuable historico-geographical sketch, entitled, \"The\r\nNicobar Islands\" (Trieste, Printing Office of the Austrian Lloyds, 1857),\r\nwhich appeared at the same time in the Transactions of the Imp. Roy.\r\nGeographical Society for 1857.\r\n\r\n[8] Vide, \"Indian Political Dispatches,\" of 1st February, 1848: also the\r\n\"Hamburger Correspondent,\" of 30th August, 1848, and \"Friend of India,\"\r\nfor 1853, p. 455.\r\n\r\n[9] Thus, for example, we find on the island of Kar-Nicobar the following\r\nspecimens of barter:--\r\n\r\n         For                            Pair of ripe cocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\n  a sort of hunting-knife or\r\n      cutlass, worth about $1-1/2                  300\r\n  a small knife-blade                              100\r\n  six table knife-blades                           300\r\n  an American knife                                 50\r\n  a hatchet                                        300\r\n  a musket                                         500\r\n  a double-barrelled gun                          2500\r\n  a large spoon                                    150\r\n  thirty feet of silver-wire                      2500\r\n  a small cask of rum                             2500\r\n  a flask of arrack                                 10\r\n  three \"sticks\" of (negro-heads) tobacco          100\r\n  a flask of castor-oil                             50\r\n  a cabin lamp                                     500\r\n  a sack of rice                                   300\r\n  a piece of blue calico (about 6 to 8 ells)       100\r\n  a neck-cloth                                     100\r\n\r\nEpsom salts, turpentine, spirit of camphor, eau-de-Cologne, and\r\npeppermint, are also much-prized articles of barter, and bring a large\r\nprofit, being exchanged for old clothes, salt meat, onions, and biscuit.\r\n\r\n[10] Thus, for instance, there occurred in one of these documents:--\"In\r\nthe village of Aurong, or Arrow, the best anchorage is opposite Capt.\r\nMarshall's hut, in from 13 to 15 fathoms water. At many points the coast\r\nis so dangerous, that one ship lost two of her men, who were endeavouring\r\nto land in a boat.\" In another certificate it was announced that the\r\nbarque _Batavia_ of Rotterdam, freighted with rice, of 442 tons burthen,\r\nwhile on her voyage from Rangoon to Europe, was wrecked in Danson's\r\npassage, 7th April, 1857, and her crew was very hospitably treated by the\r\nnatives of Kar-Nicobar. Almost every one of these certificates concludes\r\nwith the remark that whoever wishes to be on friendly terms with the\r\nnatives must play no pranks with their women, nor shoot their fowls or\r\nhogs in the forest.\r\n\r\n[11] This place of interment is situated close to a small village on the\r\nnorth-east side of the island, where the graves are visible in the shape\r\nof a number of round stakes sunk about three or four feet into the earth,\r\nwhich are adorned with all sorts of variegated cloths and ribbons.\r\n\r\n[12] It is customary to call the liquid contents of the green, unripe\r\ncocoa-nut by the name of _cocoa-nut milk_; but it is rather a clear,\r\ndelightfully palatable water, which neither in colour nor taste at all\r\nresembles milk. This is obtained or pressed from the white, sweet, rather\r\nhard kernel, which is itself extraordinarily nutritive, and forms the\r\ndaily food of the inhabitants. For an entire month, during which we could\r\nprocure neither cows' nor goats' milk, we experimented on the use of the\r\nfluid obtained from the ripe cocoa-nut in our tea and coffee, and found it\r\nso excellent that we hardly felt the privation of animal milk.\r\n\r\n[13] See Vol. I., p. 240.\r\n\r\n[14] This vocabulary, which probably will not be found altogether\r\nvalueless for the purposes of comparative philology, as also for the\r\nassistance of future travellers, will appear at the end of this volume as\r\nan Appendix.\r\n\r\n[15] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[16] Most of the Austrian sailors are from the Adriatic coast, and\r\naccordingly speak an Italian patois.\r\n\r\n[17] \"Letters on the Nicobar Islands, etc. Addressed by the Rev. I.\r\nGottfried Haensel, the only surviving missionary, to the Rev. C. J.\r\nLatrobe. London, 1812.\" We are indebted for these rare pamphlets to the\r\nkindness of Dr. Rosen of the community of the Moravian Brethren at\r\nGenaadendal in South Africa, and do not think, despite its deep interest\r\nin the history of missions, that it has ever been translated into another\r\nlanguage. Brown in his \"History of Missions\" has made a few brief extracts\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n[18] \"If an inhabitant of the South Sea Islands have planted during his\r\nlife but ten bread-fruit trees,\" says Cook, \"he has fulfilled his duties\r\ntowards his own and his grand-children as fully and effectually as the\r\ndenizen of our rougher clime, who during his life-long endures the\r\nseverity of winter, and exhausts his energies in the heats of summer, in\r\norder to provide his household with bread, and to save up some trifle for\r\nhis family to inherit.\"\r\n\r\n[19] From the Malabar word Elettari. This is the common seed so well known\r\nin the pharmacopeia in the form of a carminative tincture, and is usually\r\nknown as Alpinia Cardamomia.\r\n\r\n[20] With respect to the resemblance if not indeed identity of the\r\nvegetation of the Nicobar Archipelago, with that of the surrounding\r\nislands, and the mainland, we beg to refer here to the excellent work of\r\nan Austrian naturalist, the learned Dr. Helfer, who, stricken in the\r\nflower of his days by the poisoned arrow of a native of the Andaman\r\nIslands, fell a victim to his zeal for travel. To the Imperial Royal\r\nGeographical Society of Vienna, science is indebted for the German edition\r\nof this important information, under the title of the Published and\r\nUnpublished Works of Dr. J. W. Helfer upon the Tenasserm Provinces, the\r\nMergins Archipelago, and the Andaman Islands, in the third volume of its\r\nProceedings for 1859.\r\n\r\n[21] An extensive description of the zoology of these islands is reserved\r\nfor the zoological part of the Novara publications, published at the\r\nexpense of the Austrian government, at the Imperial Printing-office in\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\n[22] The Tagali maidens of Luzon regard it as a special proof of the\r\nhonourable intentions and eagerness of passion of their admirers, if these\r\nlatter take the betel quid from their mouths!\r\n\r\n[23] We did fall in with some few individuals on these islands who by dint\r\nof much exertion could count as high as 100.\r\n\r\n[24] At Pulo Penang the _picul_ of ripe cocoa-nuts, 300, is worth 5-1/2\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n[25] \"On measurements as a diagnostic means for distinguishing the human\r\nraces, being a systematic plan established and investigated by Dr. Karl\r\nScherzer and Dr. Edward Schwarz, for the purpose of taking measurements on\r\nindividuals of different races, during the voyage of H.

It is about 29-1/3 statute miles\r\nin length from east to west, by 16-3/5 in breadth from north to south. The\r\nsuperficial area of the island is estimated at 206 square geographical\r\nmiles, which will make it about one half larger than the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1819, Singapore was a howling wilderness, and the only\r\nsettlement upon its shores was a couple of wretched Malay fishermen's\r\nhuts; a lurking-place for the pirates, who at that period made it\r\ndangerous to navigate those waters. After the rendition of the Dutch\r\ncolonies in the Indian Archipelago, which it will be remembered were the\r\nproperty of England throughout the great continental war up to the year\r\n1814, Sir Stamford Raffles, the former Governor of Java, was intrusted\r\nwith the office of founding on it, as the most suitable spot in all the\r\nMalay seas, a free emporium where the general trade in those seas of all\r\nthe sea-faring nations of the world might be concentrated and exchanged.\r\nEngland had further in view to leave not a single foot to stand on to the\r\nDutch, whose interests in those seas clashed with her own, to obtain an\r\nemporium in which to collect all the more important products of the\r\nArchipelago for exchange against the teas and silks of China; and, lastly,\r\nto procure for the reception and repairs of the ships of war and\r\nmerchantmen, a suitable harbour, such as, being in the vicinity of the\r\nteak-growing countries, would also have the advantage of supplying timber\r\nfor her ships at any period when there might be in England a deficient\r\nsupply of oak.\r\n\r\nSir Stamford, having previously examined several other localities,\r\nultimately selected Singapore, and on 6th February, 1819, the English flag\r\nwas hoisted on this solitary island, thus unsuspectedly inaugurating the\r\nbeginning of a new era for the sea-faring world! At last, in 1824, came\r\nthe Treaty of Cerum, by which Holland withdrew her pretensions in favour\r\nof England, and Singapore became an inalienable possession of the British\r\nCrown for a sum of 60,000 Spanish dollars paid over to its previous owner\r\nthe Sultan of Djohore, together with a life-rent of 24,000 dollars\r\nannually payable to the same Malay chief. The slaves on the island were\r\nset at liberty, slavery was entirely abolished, and Singapore proclaimed a\r\nFree Port. The importance of Singapore as a site for a colony had already\r\nbeen pointed out and justified a century since by Captain Alexander\r\nHamilton, who visited these seas at the beginning of the 18th century, and\r\nin a work entitled \"A New Account of the East Indies,\" describes most\r\ncircumstantially his stay at Djohore in 1703 on his voyage to China. In\r\nthat work Hamilton narrates how the Sultan of Djohore wished to make him a\r\npresent of the island, and how he declined this proposal with the remark\r\nthat this island could be of no use to a private man, but would be\r\neminently suitable for a colony and an emporium of trade,[28] because the\r\nwinds were at all seasons favourable for egress from and entrance into\r\nthese waters on every side. A hundred years later, the choice of Sir\r\nStamford Raffles, to whom this relation of Hamilton seems to have been\r\nentirely unknown, fell upon the same locality, thus testifying alike to\r\nthe eligibility of its position, and to the wise forecast of the founder\r\nof this British settlement.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans in India round the Cape of Good Hope,\r\ntowards the commencement of the 16th century, the trade of these countries\r\nwas exclusively confined to the Arabs and Hindoos, who acted as a medium\r\nbetween the far East and Europe. Every island in the Archipelago, in\r\nproportion to the abundance and value of its vegetable produce and its\r\nforeign intercourse, had one or more harbours, at which the products of\r\nthe surrounding districts and islands were gathered and heaped up until\r\nthe monsoon permitted the arrival of the merchant vessels from the West.\r\nAt the beginning of the fine season, Arabs and Indians entered these\r\nharbours in their ships, and brought Indian and other manufactures and\r\nmerchandise, which they were in the habit of exchanging for gold, gum,\r\nspices, tortoise-shell, rosin, jewels, and such like. Acheen in the north\r\nof Sumatra, Bantam in Java, Goa in Celebes, Bruni in Borneo, and Malacca\r\nin the peninsula of the same name, were the most important of these depots\r\nfor merchandise and centres of trade. At present the importance of all\r\nthese places has faded into history, whereas Singapore, from its\r\nsingularly favourable geographical position, and the liberality of its\r\npolitical institutions, has made such a stride, as is entirely without\r\nparallel in the history of the world's trade. From a desolate haunt of\r\npiratical foes, the island has been converted into a flourishing emporium;\r\nabout 1000 foreign vessels, and fully 3000 Malay prahus and Chinese junks,\r\nflit backwards and forwards annually with all sorts of merchandise and\r\nproduce, while the value of the goods annually exchanged here amounts to\r\nabout L11,000,000. Such is the change that has come over the old\r\nunhealthy, ill-omened Malay pirate abode: thanks to a clearly defined Free\r\nTrade policy! If a doubt should still obtrude itself as to these brilliant\r\nresults of the utmost freedom and absence of restriction upon trade, it\r\nmust give way before the spectacle presented to the view of the astonished\r\nbeholder in the harbour of Singapore, the Alexandria of the 19th century!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, our stay in this harbour, so interesting in a\r\nscientific as well as in a commercial point of view, was sensibly\r\ncurtailed by the prevalence of such exceedingly unfavourable conditions of\r\nthe public health. Hardly had we cast anchor ere an officer of the English\r\nfrigate _Amethyst_ came on board to salute, and to inform us that for\r\nseveral weeks past the cholera had been ravaging the city, especially what\r\nis known as the Chinese quarter. In another war-ship then in the harbour,\r\nthe screw corvette _Niger_, several of the crew had already succumbed to\r\nthe pestilence; and even in our own immediate neighbourhood was anchored a\r\nship with flag half-mast high, a melancholy signal that the angel of death\r\nwas once more seeking victims. Our original plan of passing several weeks\r\nat Singapore had of course to be abandoned, and we determined at once to\r\nget under weigh, so soon as the ship had been re-victualled and sundry\r\nother matters of imperative necessity carefully looked to. Meanwhile the\r\nnaturalist corps landed, and proceeded to see and examine as much as they\r\npossibly could.\r\n\r\nThe town of Singapore, situated at the southern extremity of the island of\r\nthe same name, is divided by the river Singapore, on whose banks it is\r\nbuilt, into two parts, in the northernmost of which are the churches, the\r\nlaw courts, the residences of the European settlers, and a little further\r\naway the native dwellings, as also the Kampong-Klam or Bugis quarter, so\r\ncalled from the number of Bugis from Celebes who congregate there to do\r\nbusiness; while on the south bank of the river, only a few feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, are the warehouses and offices of the various European\r\nand Chinese merchants. Still farther to the southward and in another small\r\ncove, called New Harbour, are the buildings and docks of the Peninsular\r\nand Oriental Steam-Ship Company.\r\n\r\nBehind the city are visible three hills of inconsiderable height, called\r\nPearl Hill, Government Hill, and Sophia Hill. The middle one, on which\r\nstands Government House, rises on the left bank of the river, about half a\r\nmile from the sea-shore, to a height of about 156 feet above sea-level. On\r\nPearl Hill, which commands the Chinese and mercantile quarters of the\r\ntown, a citadel has been constructed. The environs of the town on every\r\nside consist of a rolling sweep of hilly country, diversified in outline\r\nby about 70 different eminences varying in height from 60 to 170 feet,\r\ncrowned with the elegant villas of the European merchants or government\r\nofficials, or the residences of wealthy Chinese or Malays. The loftiest\r\npoint is Bukit Turiah or Tin Hill, lying about the centre of the island,\r\nand 519 feet in height. Although accessible in a few hours from the city,\r\nit is very rarely made the scene of any excursions, in consequence of the\r\nforests which encircle it having for long been frequented by great numbers\r\nof tigers. These animals, eager for prey, cross from the mainland by\r\nswimming the narrow strait, hardly more than half a nautical mile in\r\nwidth, which separates it from the island. Dr. Logan, the excellent editor\r\nof the Singapore Free Press, assured us that till within the last six or\r\nseven years, 360 natives had annually been carried off by the tigers! Even\r\nat present, over 100 persons a year are killed in the forest by the tigers\r\nthat prowl there. Shortly before our arrival, in the month of March, four\r\npersons had perished by these voracious animals. For an explanation of\r\nsuch horrible occurrences, we must consider the heedlessness of the\r\nnatives, and the peculiar conditions affecting the mode of agriculture\r\nfollowed on the island. The soil of Singapore is not sufficiently fertile\r\nto make the cultivation of land a customary occupation. Even for\r\nrice-growing it is found to be unsuitable, so that the greater part of\r\nthat chief staple of subsistence has to be imported from the neighbouring\r\nislands. So far as the island has been cleared, viz. to a distance of\r\nabout five miles round the city, attempts have been made to plant nutmeg,\r\nclove, and fruit-trees. But the majority of the natives busy themselves\r\nwith sowing the Gambir and Betel shrubs in the jungle, the leaves of which\r\nare readily disposed of at a good profit among the betel-chewing\r\ninhabitants of the Indian Archipelago for an ingredient of their beloved\r\nmasticatory. The mode of cultivating these, however, is very peculiar. As\r\nGambir speedily exhausts the soil in which it is planted, and renders it\r\nquite barren, the cultivators find themselves compelled to advance as\r\nthough by a sort of perpetual emigration. They hew their way into the\r\njungle, where they plant the Gambir (_Nauclea Gambir_),[29] the withered\r\nbranches and leaves of which, after it has served their purpose, are used\r\nas manure for the _next_ shrub planted, the Betel (_Piper methysticum_).\r\nAfter a short time the soil becomes unsuited for this also, and needs\r\nseveral years' rest before it can again be made to produce any crop.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of this thriftless cultivation the natives are\r\ncompelled to penetrate deeper and deeper into the forest, in order to\r\nclear away with the axe spots of virgin soil for the planting of the\r\nGambir. They frequently pass months at a time in the jungle, and with the\r\ncarelessness characteristic of all southern races, constantly allow\r\nthemselves to be surprised by wild beasts. Government, however, does not\r\nneglect publishing ordinances, by which as far as possible to discourage\r\nthese formidable invaders. They have offered a reward of 50 dollars for\r\nevery tiger killed. So soon as the track of a tiger has been struck, the\r\nnatives usually dig a pit fifteen or twenty feet deep, which they cover\r\nslightly with grass and brushwood, and fasten close by a goat, a dog, or\r\nsome other living creature. As soon as the tiger, eager for his prey,\r\nseeks to seize the poor animal, the brushwood gives way under him and he\r\nfalls into the pit, where he is speedily finished with muskets.\r\n\r\nThe entire population of the island amounts to about 100,000 souls, of\r\nwhich the greater number, say 60,000, inhabit the town itself or the\r\nsurrounding villages. One meets here with a singular mixture of races,\r\nEuropeans, Malays, Chinese, Klings (as the natives of the Coromandel coast\r\nare called), Arabs, Armenians, Parsees (Fire-worshippers), Bengalees,\r\nBurmese, Siamese, Bugis (from Celebes), Javanese, and from time to time\r\nvisitors from every corner of the Archipelago. Of these the Europeans,\r\nalthough exercising far the largest and most preponderating influence upon\r\nthe trade of the place, are much the weakest in point of numbers, the\r\nentire community not exceeding 300 or 400 on the whole island. On the\r\nother hand, the Chinese out-number all the rest, and are still constantly\r\non the increase. Every year, as the N.E. monsoon sets in, in December and\r\nJanuary, vast swarms of Chinese flock hither, fleeing from the poverty and\r\ndistress of their native land. There are individuals, who make a regular\r\ntrade of importing into Singapore coolies from China and the Coromandel\r\ncoast. At the port of embarkation, each coolie engages with the captain,\r\nto serve one year after his arrival in Singapore with a European or native\r\nmaster, and to repay the cost of his passage out of his monthly wages. He\r\nusually receives at first 3 dollars a month (about 12_s._ 6_d._), out of\r\nwhich he lays aside 1-1/2 dol., and so gradually pays off his indebtedness\r\nto the ship captain. The passage-money, which a few years back was only\r\nabout 10 or 12 Rs. (L1 to L1 4_s._), is at present as high as 20 Rs., or\r\nL2. After the first year his earnings may amount to about 4 or 5 dols. a\r\nmonth. If, however, the coolie have repaid his debt, he is free, and may\r\neither earn a very good wage as a servant, or start in any business for\r\nhimself. The facilities for earning money are so great here for men of\r\nindustry and steadiness, that a few years' stay suffices to convert these\r\nnaked, filthy, hang-dog looking wretches into clean well-to-do workmen,\r\nand some of them even attain a certain status in the community, as\r\nplanters and merchants. Many a Chinese, who is now an important and\r\nwealthy man, possessed not a farthing when he landed on the hospitable\r\nshore of the English colony. The number of Chinese resident in Singapore\r\nis estimated at 60,000, or nearly two-thirds of the entire population of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nWe need not feel surprised therefore to find that the long-tailed children\r\nof the Flowery Land living in Singapore have begun to develope a certain\r\ntaste for luxury. They already boast a theatre of their own, a wooden\r\nbooth, like a gigantic dolls' house, in which actors from China yell out\r\ntheir \"sing-song,\" while the auditory, penned in within a\r\ncarefully-locked court-yard, chant a vociferous accompaniment to this\r\nsomewhat monotonous exhibition. Moreover, Singapore possesses a Chinese\r\ntemple of such splendour, that one would hardly find its match in the\r\nFlowery Land itself. This is called the Telloh-Ayer, situated in the\r\nstreet of the same name, and is decorated with handsome carvings,\r\ninnumerable mysterious inscriptions, and grotesque figures of stone and\r\nwood. The Chinese who conducted us all round were exceedingly friendly,\r\nand when, at parting, we slid a few pieces of silver into their hands as a\r\nrecompense for their trouble, they gave vent to their feelings in repeated\r\nchin-chins, a mode of greeting which corresponds to the Salaam of the\r\nMahometan races.\r\n\r\nMany of the Chinese of Singapore belong to secret societies (Hoes), the\r\nmembers of which seem banded together for both good and bad objects and\r\nfor mutual protection. Their rules are so strict, and their slightest\r\ninfraction is so fearfully punished, that hardly an instance has ever been\r\nknown of an associate having been denounced or proved a traitor. In the\r\nBritish possessions, where the government attaches no sort of importance\r\nto these associations, and suffers them to pass unmolested so long as the\r\nlaws of the country are not violated, these societies are unimportant, and\r\nare productive of no evil consequences; but in the Dutch East Indies,\r\nwhere the government has always kept their subjects in a state of\r\ntutelage, and is in a marked degree adverse to the Chinese settled in\r\ntheir colonies, these secret societies assume a far more dangerous\r\ncharacter, and murders on purely political grounds are far from\r\ninfrequent.\r\n\r\nThe natives proper of Singapore are Malays, and their language is that\r\nmost in use for general intercourse and trade. But as open-air labourers\r\nthey are far inferior to the Chinese, who are much more enduring, more\r\ncontented, and more sociable. In this connection the following comparative\r\nstatement, prepared a few years since by W. J. Thompson, Esq., government\r\nengineer in Singapore, of the relative values of English and Chinese\r\nlabour, will be found of much interest. To build a wall in England\r\ncontaining 306 cubic feet would, according to Mr. Thompson's estimate,\r\nemploy one bricklayer and one ordinary labourer 4-44/100 days, the former\r\nreceiving 5_s._ 6_d._ per day, the latter 3_s._ 6_d._, the total expense\r\namounting to 30_s._ In Singapore a similar piece of work, executed by\r\nChinese labourers, would require 8-54/100 days, and the daily wage would\r\namount to 2_s._ 9-3/5_d._ for the bricklayer and 1_s._ 7-3/5_d._ for his\r\nassistant, the total expense amounting to 37_s._ 6_d._ Thus, English\r\nlabour shows an economy over Chinese in the proportion of 52 to 100 in\r\ntime, and of 4 to 5 in actual expense. The following is also interesting\r\nby way of confirmation. It had been resolved to fill up a swamp in\r\nSingapore, the material for which was at hand at either extremity. The\r\nswamp was 1200 feet long, 1 foot deep, and 21 feet wide. The contract was\r\nallotted to the Chinese, and completed in 326 working days, at 13 cents or\r\n11-1/2_d._ a day. An English, or indeed any other European labourer,\r\nwould have completed the same in 187 days, so that here also English or\r\nEuropean labour in general is more valuable than Chinese or any other\r\nAsiatic labour in the proportion of 100 to 57.\r\n\r\nThese results must not however be held to indicate that the Chinese\r\nlabourer possesses less physical strength than the European, nor must we\r\nleave out of view this element in the calculation, that the one executes\r\nhis work in a temperate, the other in an excessively hot climate, to which\r\nEuropean labourers speedily succumb, or at all events lose their powers\r\nand their strength in a very marked degree. Indeed it seems to decide the\r\nquestion in favour of the Chinese over the European labourer, that the\r\nformer can work without taking any heed for his health in even the most\r\nvariable temperatures. These instructive comparisons seem to be in so far\r\nespecially valuable and useful, wherever it is projected to carry out\r\ncertain undertakings, the cost of which may be estimated, due reference\r\nbeing had to the well-ascertained expense of constructing similar works in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nNext to the Chinese, the Klings, or natives of the Coromandel coast, are\r\nin the greatest request as boatmen, coachmen, pedlars, porters, and\r\nhouse-servants, by Europeans as well as by their own successful\r\nfellow-countrymen. From their habits of extreme sobriety, they speedily\r\nsave money, and generally return home, although a certain number continue\r\npermanent settlers in Singapore. The Armenians resident here are the most\r\nlike the European mercantile community; the Arabs are the descendants of\r\nthose Mahometan priests and merchants whom the Portuguese found here when\r\nthey first visited this quarter of the globe, and are recruited from time\r\nto time, but on the whole rarely, by fresh arrivals from their mother\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOne very marked peculiarity of the population of Singapore is the enormous\r\ndisparity between the numbers of the sexes. The proportion of females to\r\nmales is as one to seven. The most probable explanation of this phenomenon\r\nis the circumstance that hitherto the emigration of females from China has\r\nbeen entirely prohibited, and consequently almost all the Chinese\r\nresidents, who constitute by far the majority of the whole population, are\r\nunmarried. Among them the proportion of females to males is as one to\r\nthirteen.\r\n\r\nThe health of Singapore is not always so bad as at the period of our\r\nvisit; indeed, judging by perquisitions made for the purpose, the climate\r\nmay rather be regarded as salubrious, particularly since the immediate\r\nvicinity of the town has been so extensively cleared. The outbreak of\r\ncholera was entirely new, and on that account an all the more appalling\r\nvisitation. The temperature is tolerably equal throughout the year.\r\nObservations carried on uninterruptedly during five years give an average\r\nof 81 deg. 3. Fahr. for the hottest month (May), and of 79 deg. 5. Fahr. for the\r\ncoldest (January). Once only during the five years (in June) did the\r\nthermometer attain a height of 87 deg. 2. Fahr. and once only in January did\r\nit fall as low as 74 deg. 8. Fahr. By comparing the present range of\r\ntemperature with that of thirty years since, it appears that since the\r\nfoundation of the settlement it has gained three degrees in temperature, a\r\nphenomenon which may be ascribed to the increase of buildings, and to the\r\nlarge clearings for a distance of five miles round the town, and perhaps\r\nalso to the spot itself where these observations were made being exposed.\r\n\r\nThere is no regular rainy season in Singapore. Rain falls every month\r\nthroughout the year, the heaviest falls occurring in August and December.\r\nAccording to observations carried on during four years, the annual\r\nrainfall averaged 93 inches. The tolerably regular distribution of the\r\nrain throughout the year imparts to the vegetation a freshness that makes\r\nthe change of seasons pass almost unheeded.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore as elsewhere the members of the _Novara_ Expedition\r\nexperienced from all classes of society the most cordial and hospitable\r\nreception. Every one bestirred himself to point out to us everything that\r\nwas worth knowing, or that the city could present of interest or deserving\r\nspecial attention. After a cursory stroll through the most frequented\r\nstreets, with their dense crowds of people, which sufficiently proved to\r\nus that trade was in fact the chief occupation of the inhabitants, we\r\nturned our attention to the shops of some of the Mahometan merchants, when\r\nour eyes were dazzled with all the most various products of India.\r\n\r\nIn one of these we were shown some exceedingly valuable diamonds from\r\nBorneo, one of which weighed 17 carats, and was worth L4000 sterling,\r\nwhile another of 19 carats, but less pure and brilliant, was for sale for\r\nL2000. The seller, a Mahometan, himself wore on his finger a diamond-ring\r\nwhich our companion estimated at L1000. In the stores of several other\r\nmerchants we saw the Malay servants sitting cross-legged on the bare floor\r\nof the porch, with huge heaps of Spanish dollars before them, which they\r\nwere busy counting. The Spanish or Mexican dollar is here almost the only\r\nmedium of exchange, payments being made all but exclusively in that\r\ncurrency, whereas gold, even English, is but sparingly used, and then with\r\nill-concealed reluctance! The utter want of any other recognized medium of\r\nexchange than silver makes all extensive money transactions exceedingly\r\nonerous, owing to the expense of transmitting the precious metals, in\r\nconsequence of which any one wishing to pay in a certain sum of a few\r\nthousand dollars in cash, must employ a convoy for the purpose of\r\ntransporting the money![30]\r\n\r\nAlthough, as already remarked, the chief business of the island is purely\r\ncommercial, and although, ordinarily speaking, every branch of industry\r\nmerges in that predominant occupation, there is yet one manufacture in\r\nSingapore which calls for most special notice. This consists in the\r\npreparation of pearl, or white sago, from the raw state, which is brought\r\nfrom the N.E. coast of Sumatra, and the N.W. coast of Borneo. Almost the\r\nwhole of the sago of commerce is prepared here, and all but exclusively by\r\nChinese labour. Sago is chiefly obtained from the pith of several species\r\nof palm, but more particularly from the _Sagus Rumphii_ and the _Sagus\r\nLaevii_, both of which are rather limited in their area of cultivation,\r\nand are not, like the cosmopolitan cocoa-nut palm, found in every quarter\r\nof the tropical zone, both in the Old and New World, but are indigenous to\r\nthe Indian Archipelago alone. The trunk of the sago-palm, when felled, is\r\na cylinder of about 20 inches in diameter, and from 15 to 20 feet in\r\nlength, which, when the woody fibres have been separated, contains about\r\n700 lbs of clear fine fecula. One may form some conception of its\r\nextraordinary productiveness on learning that three sago-palms contain as\r\nmuch nutritious matter as an acre of land grown with wheat! One piece of\r\nground of the extent of an English acre planted with sago-palms\r\noccasionally yields 313,000 lbs of sago, or as much food as 163 acres of\r\nwheat. The sago however is neither as palatable nor as nutritious as it is\r\nproductive, and nowhere, where rice is in common use, will it be displaced\r\nby this article of food. We visited the largest sago manufacture in\r\nSingapore, in which the sago, as it comes in the raw state from Borneo and\r\nSumatra, is washed and roasted, when it becomes the pearl sago of\r\ncommerce. The quantity thus prepared annually amounts to about 100,000\r\ncwt.\r\n\r\nSingapore was also the first place where we found an opportunity of\r\nbecoming acquainted with opium-smokers, and of observing the noxious\r\neffects of this custom, which was forced upon the Chinese for the purpose\r\nof compelling commercial relations. Although in almost every street in\r\nSingapore there are houses in which opium is sold and can be smoked (the\r\nso-called \"Licensed opium shops\"), there is, in order to keep more control\r\nover it, only one single place where the opium is prepared for smoking\r\nfrom the raw material, called by the English the \"Opium farm,\" from which\r\nall retail dealers must purchase their supplies of stock.\r\n\r\nBefore describing our visit to this curious factory we shall indulge in a\r\nfew observations upon a plant whose intoxicating, poisonous milky sap\r\nproduces such singular effects upon the human system. The poppy (_papaver\r\nsomniferum_), is chiefly grown in Hindostan in the districts of Benares,\r\nPatna, and Malwa. Its cultivation is exceedingly arduous, and very\r\nprecarious, since the tender young plants require constant care and\r\nattention in the way of repeated watering, as well as weeding and turning\r\nup the soil, besides which there is the ever-present danger of its\r\ndestruction by insects, or its loss through storm, or hail, or untimely\r\nrains. The plant blooms in the month of February, and three months later\r\nthe seed is ripe. The incision into the capsule however is made three or\r\nfour weeks earlier, so soon, in short, as it is covered with a fine white\r\nmealy dust. The instrument employed in this operation has three prongs\r\nwith very sharp points, with which the plant is carefully scratched. Each\r\nplant is thus tapped for three consecutive days, the operation beginning\r\nwith the first warm beams of the morning sun; the milky sap is scraped off\r\nin the cool of the next morning, and on the fourth morning each plant is\r\nagain tried as to whether it still exudes sap, but usually it proves to\r\nhave been exhausted. The juice as scraped off in its coagulated form, is\r\nput into a cask along with linseed oil, in order not to get too quickly\r\ndry, and then is made by hand-kneading into round flat cakes, of about\r\nfour pounds' weight, and about five inches in diameter, which, enveloped\r\nin poppy and tobacco leaves, are spread out to dry in earthen dishes, till\r\nready for purposes of commerce. In this stage the opium is packed in boxes\r\nof ten cakes or about 40 lbs, and thus passes from the hands of the grower\r\nor the speculator at certain fixed prices into those of the agents of the\r\nEast India Company. The very anxious and precarious cultivation of the\r\npoppy must prove far less remunerative to the proprietor of the land than\r\nthe much easier task of raising tobacco or sugar-cane, and it is only the\r\nlong-established but most impoverishing system of payments in advance,\r\npursued by the agents of the East India Company, that keeps the Hindoos\r\nengaged in opium cultivation.[31]\r\n\r\nAt the opium farm in Singapore we saw this same coagulated juice, as\r\nobtained from the poppy, converted into opium suitable for smoking, which\r\nis called _chandu_, the process consisting in its being exposed to the\r\naction of heat in large semicircular brass pans, strained through filters,\r\nand once more exposed to a low heat, until it finally coagulates into a\r\nconsistency strongly resembling treacle or syrup. The whole manipulation\r\noccupies from four to five days. A cattie or ball of this thickened\r\npoppy-juice costs the manufacturer about 20 dols. From ten such balls of\r\nthe raw sap, or about 40 lbs, which is the usual weight of each \"chest,\"\r\nas imported from Hindostan, 216 \"tiles\" or about 18 lbs of opium are\r\nobtained upon an average. We saw the Chinese dealer place in one of the\r\nscales a Spanish dollar, instead of a regular weight, and measure off a\r\ncorresponding weight of opium in the other, A _Chi_, weighing about 1/16\r\noz., the ordinary quantity consumed by an opium-smoker, costs 17-1/2\r\ncents, or nine-pence. The duty levied upon this manufacture gives the\r\ngovernment a revenue of L3000 a month, for the exclusive right of\r\npreparing opium fit for smoking, _chandu_, for consumption on the island.\r\n\r\nAs often as the apparatus is called into activity, the Chinese employed in\r\nthe preparation of the opium, in pursuance of what seems with them a\r\nregular custom at the commencement of any spell of work, commit to the\r\nflames, after repeating a certain set of formulas of prayer, a number of\r\noctavo-sized leaves (_Tschni-tschni-soa_) of paper printed upon one side\r\nonly, and occasionally provided in very large quantities: on these fabrics\r\nof the roughest material are printed sometimes prayers in Chinese,\r\nsometimes all kinds of drawings, intended to express the wishes of those\r\nmaking the offering, and which ordinarily represent in very sketchy\r\noutline those objects which they pray their deities to bestow on them. In\r\nthus burning, in a copper vessel specially prepared for the purpose, not\r\nunlike the baptismal font in a Christian church, these small slips of\r\npaper, the Chinese operative believes that his petition ascends to heaven\r\nas smoke, and so comes under the cognizance of his protecting gods.\r\nSimilarly in all temples and pagodas, large quantities may be found stored\r\naway of these paper intercessors with the Chinese gods, intended for the\r\nuse of believers, or rather of those who make profession of faith.\r\n\r\nThe workmen of the opium farm have a part of their wages paid in opium.\r\nThe greater number are themselves opium-smokers, and thus are all the more\r\nsurely attached to the manufacture. We saw a number of these fellows lying\r\nstretched out on straw mats, in wretched filthy-looking dens of rooms,\r\nwith blue curtains barely concealing them from view, and the spirit-lamp\r\nplaced conveniently near to enable them from time to time to heat the\r\n_chandu_, the smoke of which they inhale through a peculiarly constructed\r\npipe (_Yeu-tsiang_). The quantity of opium taken up at each dip by the\r\ninstrument used, a three-cornered, flat-headed sort of needle specially\r\nadapted for the purpose, is about the size of a pea. The practised\r\nopium-smoker holds his breath for a considerable time, and passes the\r\nsmoke through the nostrils. The taste of the half-fluid juice of the\r\npoppy is sweetish and oily, but the odour of the _chandu_ when heated,\r\nwhich one of the workmen addicted to smoking insisted on our regarding as\r\none of the most valuable of perfumes, is so disagreeable as almost to\r\ncause nausea. We saw numbers of smokers, athwart the filthy gossamer-like\r\ncurtains, utterly stupefied, and lying carelessly stretched out on the\r\nhard bedsteads, the pipe fallen out of their hands, and the lamp on the\r\ntable in front of their couch extinguished. They, however, did not want\r\nthe curtain for the purpose of preventing their being disturbed in the\r\nluxurious enjoyment of their beatific dreams; for they continued in a\r\nstate resembling death itself, from which hardly anything could possibly\r\nrouse them so long as the effects of the poisonous drug lasted. Others of\r\nthe smokers were so affected by it as to have utterly lost their senses,\r\nand seemed on the whole entirely indifferent to all that was passing\r\naround them. One of the workmen, who was in a high state of excitement,\r\nand was uncommonly talkative, informed us however that he had to smoke\r\nabout one shilling's worth of opium ere he could feel its effect, that\r\nthere was nothing more annoying or insupportable than mere partial\r\nstupefaction, when one had no more money wherewith to buy opium so as to\r\nbe able to get into a proper state of somnolence. The entire system at\r\nsuch times gets into a frightful state of irritation; there is severe\r\nheadache, a sensation of pressure on the stomach, nausea, in a word all\r\nthe ill-effects of the use of opium, without any of its more agreeable\r\nsensations. The state of intoxication and drowsiness usually lasts from\r\nforty to sixty minutes, when consciousness gradually returns, without any\r\nill-effects being experienced at the moment from the inhalation of the\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, where comparatively high wages are paid, and the Chinese\r\npopulation is the most numerous, the annual consumption of opium amounts\r\nto about 330 grains per head. In the Island of Java, where, in consequence\r\nof certain limits prescribed by government, the Chinese element amounts to\r\nbut 1/100th of the entire population, the consumption is hardly forty\r\ngrains per head. Even in China, where this perilous narcotic is consumed\r\nin such enormous quantities, the amount sold only indicates 140 grains for\r\neach smoker, which however is chiefly attributable to the poverty of the\r\npopulace, by whom this luxury is unattainable. Unfortunately we could get\r\nno reliable information as to the number of opium-smokers, and the\r\nquantity of opium consumed, in Singapore. Mr. Allen, a North American\r\nmissionary, estimates the number of persons who surrender themselves to\r\nthis practice throughout the Chinese Empire, at from 4-5,000,000, who\r\nannually consume about 50,000 chests of opium. The quantity consumed by\r\neach smoker daily varies in an extraordinary degree. At first the beginner\r\ncannot inhale above two or three grains at a time, but gradually, as he\r\nbecomes habituated, the dose increases, till the confirmed smokers\r\nconsume as much as 100 grains daily!! Many Chinese spend two-thirds of\r\ntheir earnings in the purchase of this drug, which has become for them a\r\nnecessity of life.\r\n\r\nThe practice of eating opium in the form of pills, which prevails in every\r\nMahometan country in the East, and has in a special degree been readily\r\nadopted by the disciples of the Koran, in consequence of the prohibition\r\nof wine, would seem, judging by the researches of physicians, to be much\r\nless injurious and much slower in affecting the human system than smoking\r\nthe opium, or otherwise bringing it directly in contact with the lungs,\r\nwhile the effects of the former practice is likewise different.\r\n\r\nWe shall have an opportunity, when describing our stay in Chinese waters,\r\nto revert to this most remarkable and most profitable, but at the same\r\ntime most iniquitous, monopoly of the (late) East India Company, which\r\ncrushes millions of human beings in the most appalling and hopeless of all\r\nslaveries, and against the continuance of which the Chinese government has\r\nrepeatedly but ineffectually set its face. The words of the\r\nidol-worshipping Emperor of China, when in 1840 he was solicited to\r\nconvert the importation of opium into a source of revenue to the state,\r\nwere worthy of a Christian monarch: \"It is true,\" said the Chinese ruler,\r\n\"I cannot hinder the importation of this subtle poison; infamous men in\r\nthe lust for gain will out of covetousness or sensuality set at nought the\r\nfulfilment of my wishes;--but they shall never induce me to enrich myself\r\nby the vices and the wretchedness of my people!\"\r\n\r\nDespite the very small proportion of Europeans resident in Singapore, and\r\nthat almost the entire time of those few seems to be absorbed in business,\r\nthere is nevertheless considerable intellectual activity. Several\r\nnewspapers in the English language, among which the \"Singapore Free\r\nPress,\" edited by Mr. A. Logan, occupies the foremost rank, supply\r\ninformation as to all that is worth knowing in every part of the East\r\nIndies, while the \"Journal of the Indian Archipelago,\" which has been for\r\nmany years so ably and carefully conducted by the well-known and\r\nwidely-famous J. H. Logan (brother of the editor of the \"Press\"), is a\r\nveritable mine of information for the naturalist, who wishes to make the\r\nhistory of the Indian Archipelago and its inhabitants the object of his\r\nstudy. It contains exceedingly useful data for extending our knowledge of\r\nthese very remarkable countries, susceptible as they are of such\r\nextraordinary development.\r\n\r\nThe colony also boasts a Museum of Natural History adjoining a library\r\nwith several thousand volumes, and a reading-room, copiously supplied with\r\nnewspapers and periodicals, the whole forming what is called the\r\n\"Singapore Institution.\" This enterprise was founded by shares of 40\r\ndollars each, and is supported by an annual subscription of 24 dollars by\r\neach member, which confers the privilege of using the well-selected\r\nlibrary of books, and a great number of English and French papers and\r\nperiodicals. The small ethnographic collection consists chiefly of\r\nspecimens from Borneo, Sumatra, and the adjoining islands.\r\n\r\nAmong the educational institutions most deserving of attention and\r\nrecognition must be specially noticed the school for the instruction of\r\nMalay boys and girls, under the management and preceptorship of that most\r\ndeserving missionary, Mr. B. P. Keasberry, who has pursued a career of\r\nuseful activity in this Archipelago during thirty years past. The parents\r\nof the children taken in here have to contribute to their support, and to\r\nleave them there for at least ten years, under the affectionate spiritual\r\ncare of the missionary, and must not remove them till after the expiry of\r\nthat period. This condition was rendered necessary by the fickleness of\r\nthe Malay nature, which otherwise would frequently withdraw the children\r\nfrom the supervision of the missionary at the very moment when they were\r\nbeginning to become amenable to the influences of instruction in\r\nChristianity and civilization. The Institution is supported partly by\r\nvoluntary contributions, partly by the profits of a printing business, in\r\nwhich, however, hardly anything is printed except educational and\r\nreligious works in the Malay language. Mr. Keasberry was so kind as to\r\npresent us with a small collection of the works thus published during the\r\npast year, comprising among others a dictionary of the English and Malay\r\nlanguages, the New Testament, a volume of Natural History, a Manual of\r\nGeography, a Universal History, a Biblical History, and numerous\r\neducational works in Malay for the use of the pupils.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a visit we paid to the Police Court we had the pleasure\r\nof becoming acquainted with Mr. Windsor Carl, the well-known author of\r\nnumerous valuable works relating to the Indian Archipelago and the Papuan\r\nNegroes, a gentleman whose career in life has been of the strangest, at\r\npresent holding the position of magistrate in Singapore, where his great\r\nexperience and his thorough acquaintance with the Malay language must be\r\nof the utmost service to government. The audience assembled in the Court\r\nroom, in which only causes under 50 Rs. are tried, consisted for the most\r\npart of Chinese. Almost all the officials, clerks, inspectors, and\r\npolicemen were coloured. In one month 414 causes came on for trial, of\r\nwhich 315 were disposed of by the imposition on the culprits of fines\r\namounting in the aggregate to 5975 Rs., but of this sum only 5105 Rs. were\r\nrealized. The largest number of sentences are passed in March, because the\r\nChinese celebrate the New Year on the first day of that month, and\r\naccordingly the largest number of cases of assault, &c., occur at that\r\nperiod. The police _employes_ registered in that period above 100 cases of\r\ntransgressions of the law. The New Year is however, as must be remembered,\r\nthe solitary festival which John Chinaman takes out of his appointed work,\r\nsince recognizing as they do neither Sunday nor feast-day they continue\r\nhard at work for all the rest of the year. The majority of decisions refer\r\nto prohibited games; and whoever knows the inextinguishable love of the\r\nChinese populace for spending their time in gambling, will readily\r\ncomprehend how in a single year there occurred above 2000 cases in which\r\nthe law was violated. While we were in the justice-room, a paper was\r\nhanded in to the presiding magistrate, in which an English sailor, at that\r\nmoment in hospital, urgently requested that he might leave the same,\r\ninasmuch as he felt no longer sure of his life, owing to the numbers daily\r\nbrought thither to die of cholera. In fact the hospital, and the\r\nlocalities adjacent, seemed to be the spots most seriously visited by the\r\npestilence, so that the prayer of the petitioner to be removed from that\r\nneighbourhood was not altogether unfounded.\r\n\r\nOne highly interesting establishment, deserving of universal imitation, is\r\nthe penal colony for criminals sentenced to transportation for life from\r\nall parts of India, and known as \"The Convict Settlement.\" In order to\r\ncomprehend the object and tendency of this institution, it seems necessary\r\nto premise certain remarks upon the political relation of Singapore to\r\nIndia at large. Singapore in conjunction with the colony of Malacca, which\r\ngives its name to the entire peninsula, and the island of Penang,\r\nincluding the district of Wellesley, form that range of British\r\nsettlements in the Straits of Malacca which is usually known to the\r\nEnglish as \"The Straits Settlements.\" Up to quite a recent date, these\r\ncolonies, founded almost exclusively in the interests of British commerce,\r\nwere under the authority of the Indian government, and were in fact\r\ncontrolled from Calcutta. To the Directors of the East India Company,\r\nhowever, these settlements, of whose future destiny the mother country has\r\nhitherto taken but little heed, notwithstanding their enormous political\r\nand commercial importance, appeared to be specially adapted as a place for\r\nmaintaining common criminals, as also the more dangerous class of\r\npolitical offenders, and accordingly converted these settlements into\r\npenal colonies for the Indies, of which that of Singapore is the most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThe director of this institution, Captain McNair, had the kindness to\r\naccompany the members of the Novara expedition through the extensive\r\nbuildings, for the most part only one storey high, but well adapted for\r\nthis purpose, and to furnish us with much information on the various\r\nparticulars and special matters of interest relating to the establishment.\r\nEver since the year 1854, the wretched, confined, wooden huts thatched\r\nwith straw, in which up to that period the unfortunate criminals were\r\nconfined, have been removed, and in their stead lofty, airy, good-sized\r\napartments have been substituted. At the period of our visit in April\r\n1858, there were over 2000 transported for life, and 245 sentenced to\r\nvarious terms of from five to ten years, confined here. All the public\r\nbuildings of the island, churches, hospitals, barracks, works in the\r\nstreets, sometimes constructions of a most expensive nature, were executed\r\nthroughout by criminals. After sixteen years' good conduct, the prisoner\r\nwas entitled to a \"ticket of leave,\" authorising him to settle within the\r\njurisdiction of the island as a free colonist, coupled with the condition\r\nof presenting himself once a month before the superintendent of the\r\nsettlement. In case of bad conduct, or failure, or irregularity in\r\nfulfilling such stipulations, these concessions are revoked. All the\r\noverseers of the convict settlement, who receive monthly pay at the rate\r\nof from one to two dollars, are prisoners who have already given proof of\r\ntheir desire to return to a better mode of life, and it is well worth\r\nremark, that the 2000 convicts, consisting for the most part of the very\r\ndregs of the various Indian races, and condemned for grave crimes to\r\nperpetual imprisonment, are under the charge of a single white turnkey,\r\nand by him maintained in perfect order and propriety of demeanour. Besides\r\nthis one official there is only a small detachment of Indian soldiers,\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen in number, stationed at the settlement as a measure\r\nof precaution. The best evidence of the excellent system on which this\r\ninstitution is administered, will be found in the published reports of its\r\nhealth, from which it appears that of the 2000 there confined, there were\r\nbut forty sick at the very period when the cholera was committing such\r\nterrific ravages in the town among the poorer classes, and the change of\r\nthe monsoon had been accompanied by great sickness and general\r\nunhealthiness. The convicts go to work at six every morning, and return to\r\nthe barracks about 4 P.M., the rest of the day being spent in preparing\r\ntheir victuals, consisting of rice, vegetables, cayenne-pepper, and fruit.\r\nAs most of those confined are Hindoos and profess Brahminism, they bathe\r\nseveral times a day, in a large tank filled with excellent water. This\r\nwise religious custom must in such a sultry climate conduce in a marked\r\ndegree to the preservation of their health, by its beneficial and\r\nrefreshing action upon the frame.\r\n\r\nSome of the convicts are also employed in manufacturing cordage, ropes,\r\ntwine, &c., of the fibres of the wild plantain (_Musa textilis_), the\r\nRame-shrub (_Boehmeria nivea_), and the wild pine-apple (_Bromelia Ananas_\r\nor _Ananassa Sativa_). All these textures are of excellent quality, and\r\npossess all the best properties of Russian hemp-fabrics, at a considerable\r\nreduction of cost.\r\n\r\nIn the dormitories the convicts are not classified by nationalities as\r\nduring the labours of the day, but according to the nature of the offences\r\nfor which they are incarcerated, so that in one division all the thieves\r\nare together, in another all the homicides, in a third all those convicted\r\nof arson, &c. Although from a psychological point of view much might be\r\nurged against the judiciousness of such a system, yet, as we were\r\ninformed, this method of confinement by classification of offences\r\nexercises no prejudicial effect upon the moral amelioration of the\r\nconvicts, but on the contrary most encouraging results have been observed\r\nto arise from its operation. Among others we were told of a Hindoo from\r\nthe Malabar coast, a convict for life, who after sixteen years'\r\nconfinement received permission to settle on the island as a free\r\ncolonist. By industry, ability, and some fortunate speculations, this man\r\nin the course of years acquired a large fortune. He now felt an intense\r\nyearning to revisit his own home, and expressed his willingness to present\r\na large portion of his newly acquired wealth for such a permission. But\r\nthe law was explicit upon this point. Only a free pardon from the\r\nGovernor-general of India can as a rule avail to make such an exception,\r\nwhich is of but rare occurrence. This he actually succeeded in obtaining\r\nafter repeated supplications, and this \"fortunate unfortunate\" was at last\r\npermitted to return to his longed-for home. It is worth noting that of the\r\n2245 prisoners, only fifty are of the female sex, chiefly Hindoo women\r\nfrom Bengal. Among those imprisoned while we were there, we remarked three\r\nwhite men, who had been sentenced to several months' confinement for\r\nriotous conduct and drunkenness. Surrounded as they were by these bronzed\r\nhalf-savage Hindoo offenders, these men made a doubly painful impression\r\nupon Europeans.\r\n\r\nAs the prevalence of disease in the town and harbour made it especially\r\ndesirable that we should as speedily as possible change our quarters, in\r\norder not to be surprised by a visit on board from a guest so formidable,\r\nwe made all possible efforts to complete with the utmost dispatch the\r\nrevictualling of the ship, and transact whatever other business was\r\nnecessary. For this purpose we were recommended in several quarters to\r\nemploy a Chinese merchant, whose name is already favourably mentioned by\r\nCommodore Wilks on the occasion of his visiting Singapore in 1842. This\r\nwas Whampoa, a ship-chandler, who indeed in similar departments of trade\r\ncarries on by no means insignificant competition with the long-established\r\nEnglish firms. His business is unquestionably the most extensive in this\r\nline in Singapore, and furnishes a striking example of what Chinese\r\nindustry, economy, and perseverance are capable of. Immense quantities of\r\nprovisions and ship-stores are accumulated in his extensive warehouses, so\r\nthat he can supply orders to any extent in an incredibly short space of\r\ntime. Within two days, Whampoa had completely victualled the ship for six\r\nmonths, besides supplying her from the adjoining stream with 100 tons of\r\ngood water, which was brought alongside in boats specially constructed for\r\nthe purpose, and thence pumped through hose into the iron water-tanks in\r\nthe hold, an operation which in any European port would have taken thrice\r\nthe time required here. Moreover all the articles supplied by Whampoa were\r\nof the best quality, and proportionally moderate in price. He employs none\r\nbut Chinese, with long tails, and black silk apparel. All the books are\r\nkept in the Chinese language, and even the additions and subtractions are\r\nnot made in the European method, but by the Chinese _counting_ board, that\r\nis, by shifting a number of wooden beads or rings, which run in different\r\nrows, and have a variety of values. This reckoning-board consists of an\r\noblong frame, divided in its length by a partition into unequal divisions,\r\nin the larger of which are hung five, in the smaller two, beads upon metal\r\ncross wires. Each wire with the seven beads running upon it constitutes a\r\nsingle row, and in each such row, a single bead of the smaller division is\r\nequal in value to the five corresponding beads in the larger compartment;\r\nwhile, just as in the Russian reckoning-board, each row represents a\r\nvalue tenfold greater or less with reference to the two arms adjoining it\r\non either side. On the Chinese board the number of cross wires is not\r\nalways the same, but depends upon the extent of the calculations intended\r\nto be made upon it.[32]\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: A Chinese Counting Board.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly when a Chinese wishes to make a calculation upon his\r\nreckoning-board, he lays it crosswise before him, with the large\r\ncompartment next himself, pushes the beads of the two divisions to the\r\nedge of the frame, whence, as the process of calculation may require, he\r\nshifts them into the middle against the partition-wire, or pushes them\r\nback again. In the former case the beads are said to \"count on the\r\nboard,\" in the latter to be \"off the board.\" Consequently, in order to\r\nhave 1, 2, 3, and 4 \"counting,\" a corresponding number of beads in the\r\nlarger compartment must be pushed away from himself till they reach the\r\npartition; to mark 5, he similarly draws towards himself a bead in the\r\nsmaller compartment, and as 6, 7, 8, and 9 are formed by the addition of 5\r\nand 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, these will be marked by adding one bead\r\nfrom the lesser compartment to the requisite number of beads in the\r\ngreater. The tens are indicated by the beads of the next wire to the left;\r\nthe hundreds by the next again to that, &c.\r\n\r\nWithin his own house, Whampoa lives entirely in the European fashion.\r\nPlentifully blessed with this world's goods, he displays a degree of\r\nluxury such as we are unaccustomed to see save in the most elevated\r\ncircles of society. One of his properties, which is several miles in\r\ncircumference, has a spacious, elegantly furnished mansion with a splendid\r\ncolonnade, a beautiful flower-garden, and a perfect menagery of useful\r\ndomestic animals. Within the house all the arrangements are European, with\r\nthe exception of the oval doors, communicating between the great saloon\r\nand the antechambers, which are pushed into the wall on either side, and\r\nhave a very surprising effect. In the evening, especially when the saloon\r\nis illuminated, if a person passes through this oval entrance, the effect\r\nis as of a life-size portrait set in a golden frame. It would not be a bad\r\nidea to introduce this Chinese form of door-way into our European\r\nresidences and country-seats, and it is assuredly not the only improvement\r\nin the decorative art which we could borrow with advantage from the\r\nChinese. Whampoa's own favourite habitation is about four miles outside\r\nthe town, and presents a curious admixture of European comfort and taste\r\nwith Chinese notions of ornament. In the saloons, adorned with a quantity\r\nof neat fancy ornaments, are suspended from the walls verses and proverbs\r\nof the most renowned Chinese poets, all written on long elegantly\r\nillustrated rolls of paper. Our host also showed us a variety of objects\r\nwhich had been presented to him by foreign ship captains, officers of the\r\nnavy, and even singers, as the late Mrs. Catherine Hayes Bushnell, whom he\r\nhad shown much attention to. A banquet, to which we were invited by this\r\nhospitable Chinese to meet a number of the most prominent commercial\r\nmagnates of the colony, was served entirely in the European style. The\r\nviands were cooked by a Chinese cook, in the English and French styles,\r\nonly the dessert came part from Japan, part from China, and consisted of a\r\nvariety of fruits, which were utterly unknown to the eye and the palate of\r\nthe European guests. Our Chinese host seemed quite at home in doing the\r\nhonours. Although outwardly a Chinese of the most orthodox stamp, with\r\nshaven head, (except the long tail reaching almost to the earth,) and his\r\nbody robed in a black silken stuff, he drank to each of his guests in good\r\nold English style, and seemed as little afraid of Sherry as of Champagne.\r\nIndeed, we even had toasts, in the course of which this Chinese friend to\r\nforeigners remarked in English, that any amelioration of the present\r\ncritical condition of his native land, can only be effected by the\r\nprogressive influence of the British government. Whampoa is in all\r\nprobability the first Chinese who has sent his son to Europe.\r\n\r\nOn the very last day of our stay in Singapore, a melancholy accident\r\noccurred on board. One of our sailors named Rossi, while unbending a sail\r\nfor the purpose of repair, fell from the fore-yard on the forecastle,\r\nwhere he lay insensible, and died a few hours afterwards. Latterly\r\nrepeated instances had occurred at short intervals, of the sailors, while\r\nworking at various elevations, losing hold and falling on deck, but none\r\nof these had had such a tragical result as the present, and a few slight\r\ninjuries was all the penalty the sufferers received for their\r\ncarelessness. Singularly enough, such accidents mostly occur to the able\r\nseamen, because that class usually feel themselves as secure while resting\r\non the foot-ropes, and working among the masts and sails, as on the ground\r\nitself, and from their carelessness come much more frequently to grief,\r\nthan their comrades less experienced in man[oe]uvring among the cordage.\r\nRossi was reverently committed to the earth in the Catholic burying-ground\r\nof Singapore, and arrangements were at the same time made for the erection\r\nof a small grave-stone over his distant resting-place, informing the\r\nvisitors to this \"Court of Peace,\" that below reposes a member of the\r\n_Novara_ Expedition, who had lost his life in the discharge of his duties.\r\n\r\nAs we were now at the season of the change of monsoon, at which period the\r\nalways difficult navigation of the narrow seas between Singapore and\r\nBatavia demands an unusual degree of carefulness, in consequence of\r\nfrequent squalls, we engaged a pilot, who for a stipulated sum of 175\r\ndollars was to convoy us to the next station on our voyage. Captain\r\nBurrows, as our pilot was named, had the reputation of being a specially\r\ncompetent, thoroughly trustworthy person, who for a long period had\r\nnavigated these waters in his own ship, and, as we were informed, had,\r\nowing to some unfortunate speculations, been compelled to become a pilot\r\nof other vessels, after having for years sailed in command of his own\r\nship. He had already come on board with his traps, but, as wind and tide\r\nwere both unfavourable, he obtained permission to return to shore till\r\nsunset. This however the pilot did not do, and on the following morning,\r\nfinding he did not come off despite our signals, we set sail without him\r\nabout 9 A.M. with favourable wind and tide. No one could account for the\r\ndefault of a pilot so strongly recommended on all hands, particularly as\r\nall his baggage had remained on board, and must now of course make the\r\nvoyage to Batavia. For a moment we conjectured that he had immediately on\r\nlanding been seized by the dread distemper, only it seemed improbable we\r\nshould not have been informed of such a catastrophe. And in fact it\r\nafterwards appeared that his having missed us was entirely due to his own\r\ninattention.\r\n\r\nWe at first had intended to pass through the narrow strait of Rhio,[33] by\r\nwhich the route is materially shortened, but as the squally weather had\r\nfairly set in, while the breeze had crept round to the S.E., and the tide\r\nset strong to the northwards, we abandoned this plan, and decided on\r\nsailing through the channel between Horsburgh light-house and Bintang, so\r\nas to pass to the eastward of this island as far as Graspar Straits, which\r\nhowever we only reached the following day, owing to light fitful breezes\r\nfrom the northwards. So soon as we entered Gaspar Straits we found the\r\nsea, which is here of no great depth, never exceeding 25 fathoms, partly\r\ncovered with trunks of trees and sea-weed, while the water had lost its\r\ntransparency and was of a dirty green colour.\r\n\r\nAt 10 A.M. of the 25th April, we crossed the equator for the third time,\r\nand the same day about 11 P.M. were in sight of the rocky island of Tothy,\r\na rain-squall from the N.E. blowing at the time. We passed between this\r\nisland and the dangerous because invisible Vega Rock, just below the\r\nsurface of the sea, and found ourselves in an archipelago of islands and\r\nshoals requiring the utmost vigilance in navigating ships of large size.\r\nBut the moon, \"the seaman's friend,\" shone brightly at night, and the\r\nwell-known transparency of the air in tropical countries enabled us even\r\nduring the hours of darkness to make out with perfect distinctness islands\r\nlying 25 to 30 miles distant, so that we were by these means, coupled with\r\noccasional casts of the lead, enabled on every occasion to make out with\r\nsufficient exactness at what point we had arrived. We were so lucky as to\r\nhave never once throughout this intricate navigation been compelled to\r\ncast anchor (as is so frequently the case here), and thus succeeded in\r\noverhauling in Gaspar Straits more than one merchantman, that was a far\r\nbetter sailer than the _Novara_.\r\n\r\nOn 30th April in 2 deg. 48' S., and 107 deg. 16' E., we celebrated the anniversary\r\nof our departure from Trieste, with hearts filled with gratitude to the\r\nillustrious projector of an expedition devoted to such lofty aims.\r\n\r\nAlthough during our stay in Singapore the cholera had not alone carried\r\noff its victims in the town, but also in the harbour, especially in the\r\nscrew corvette _Niger_, anchored in our immediate vicinity, which lost at\r\nthe rate of about a man daily till she changed her moorings, and\r\nultimately had to put to sea (which under such circumstances gives hope\r\nfrom the very first for a change for the better in the requisite sanitary\r\nconditions for restoring to health), yet the crew of the _Novara_ seemed\r\ndestined to escape the slightest evil effects from our six days' stay in\r\nthis plague-stricken harbour. But the result did not justify these\r\nexpectations. Five days after our departure from Singapore, just as we\r\nwere entering Gaspar Straits, one of the ship's boys fell ill with all\r\nthe symptoms of the Asiatic pestilence, and two days after the man\r\nappointed to attend him was similarly seized. Every necessary precaution\r\nwas taken, the crew were kept as much as possible on deck, the band played\r\nfrequently, in order to keep up cheerfulness, and thus by great good\r\nfortune the malady was confined to the two individuals seized. The\r\nattendant ere long recovered, but the lad, after the choleraic symptoms\r\nhad subsided, gradually fell into a typhoid state, under which, despite\r\nthe utmost medical skill, he succumbed on the afternoon of May 4th. Owing\r\nto the rapidity with which decomposition sets in in organic structures in\r\nthese hot latitudes, it was at once arranged that the body should be\r\ncommitted to the deep the same evening. It was the first occasion\r\nthroughout the voyage that we had to perform this sad but most impressive\r\nceremony. The officers and crew mustered on the deck. The body wrapped in\r\nan ensign lay upon a platform, close to the man-ropes on the starboard\r\nside. The chaplain prayed over the corpse of one so young, about to rest\r\nin the bosom of ocean far from friends and family, after which there was a\r\ndull hollow sound; the sea had got his prey, the waves closed with sullen\r\nglee over their booty,--and all was over!\r\n\r\nIn the course of the passage we also celebrated a funeral service on board\r\nfor Austria's great, never-to-be-forgotten commander, Field-marshal\r\nRadetzky, of whose death we had shortly before been apprized. As far as\r\ncircumstances admitted, everything was done to celebrate this solemn duty\r\nin a befitting manner.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during this part of our voyage, owing to the slight depth,\r\naveraging only 14 fathoms, of the Gaspar Strait, we observed sea-snakes\r\nbasking on the surface of the sea, and letting the waves roll them lazily\r\nforward, several of which, about four feet long, were caught in a common\r\ninsect-net.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the afternoon of May 5, we anchored in the roads of Batavia,\r\nin 6-1/2 fathoms, mud bottom. The aspect of the roads, especially in bad\r\nweather, is rather melancholy, the coast being low and swampy, and densely\r\ncovered with mangrove-bushes, through which glittered a portion of the\r\nred-tiled roofs of the lower ancient city of Batavia, now abandoned on\r\naccount of its insalubrity. Under a more cheerful sky the country round\r\nwould of course assume a more agreeable and even imposing appearance, when\r\nthe outline of the gigantic volcanoes of Java come into view in the\r\nbackground, with their heavenward towering peaks, partly covered with\r\nsnow, permitting us to form some faint conception of the prodigality of\r\nNature in this, the most beautiful island of the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn the roads of Batavia we found much less bustle and animation than one\r\ncould anticipate, considering the favourable situation and immense\r\nimportance of the place. A short distance from us lay the Dutch frigate\r\n_Palembang_, carrying the flag of a Vice-admiral, and the steam-corvette\r\n_Groeningen_, besides which we counted some sixty foreign merchantmen, and\r\nover a hundred native boats and coasting vessels. This rather small\r\nevidence of commercial activity is the more noticeable when one has just\r\ncome from the free port of Singapore, where several hundred ships are\r\nalways lying at anchor, sporting the flags of every sea-faring nation,\r\nwithout taking account of the almost innumerable Chinese and Malay\r\ncoasters, trading between Singapore and the other islands of the Sunda\r\nArchipelago. Moreover, there are here no small boats plying to and fro,\r\nbecause the communications between the city and the roadstead being over a\r\nspace requiring an hour and a half to traverse, the transit is necessarily\r\ndear, and remains therefore confined within as small limits as possible.\r\nFor a small boat with two rowers from the roads to the landing-place the\r\ncharge is from four to five florins (6_s._ 8_d._ to 8_s._ 4_d._), and\r\n3-1/2 florins (5_s._ 10_d._) more for a vehicle to transport them to the\r\ntown. For this reason no artisans, trades-people, or washerwomen will come\r\noff to where the shipping is at anchor, to take orders--every commission\r\nof whatever nature must be executed in the city itself. Here we lay at\r\nanchor, an Austrian frigate, surely a most unwonted visitant, from the\r\nafternoon till the following morning without one single boat coming off to\r\nvisit us!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] City of Lions, from Singha, the Sanscrit for Lion, a title of Indian\r\nprinces, which we again meet with in Singhala, the kingdom of Lions, as\r\nCeylon is called in ancient records and histories.\r\n\r\n[28] Captain Alexander Hamilton's \"New Account of the East Indies,\r\n1688-1723.\" Edinburgh, 1727. 8vo, Vol. II., p. 63.\r\n\r\n[29] From this shrub is prepared the drug _Kino_, once much used in the\r\nPharmacop[oe]ia, but now displaced by _catechu_.\r\n\r\n[30] A similar system prevails to this day throughout Hindostan, where the\r\nnecessity for convoy of specie forms one of the most important items of\r\nexpense in the maintenance of local police, outlying military stations,\r\n&c. And unfortunately such a policy reacts upon the respect of the natives\r\nfor British rule, for seeing that even the government requires such\r\nconvoys, they naturally presume that government feels itself insecure, and\r\nhence refuse to co-operate in the development of Indian resources.\r\n\r\n[31] The net produce of an acre of land grown with poppy amounts to about\r\n20 or 30 rupees, producing about 30 lbs of opium.

Old Batavia (Jacatra), built\r\nby the Dutch in 1619, on an extremely swampy and most unhealthy spot, is\r\nat present entirely abandoned by the white population, and the numerous\r\nhandsome edifices still standing there are now only used as warehouses,\r\ncounting-houses, and offices generally. Where in days of yore a hundred\r\nthousand human beings bustled to and fro, there are at present dwelling\r\nbut a couple of thousand wretched, poverty-stricken Portuguese and\r\nJavanese. The Dutch in selecting such a site undoubtedly took their own\r\nAmsterdam for a model, and the houses were accordingly built as close as\r\npossible to each other, and several storeys high, a mode of building\r\neminently unsuited to a tropical climate, and accordingly adding another\r\nelement of insalubrity. The thick fog, which every evening at sundown\r\nspreads over the city, situate as it is hardly above the level of the sea,\r\nis not only very injurious to Europeans, but proves quite frequently\r\nfatal, so that by 5 P.M. old Batavia assumes the appearance of a city of\r\nthe dead, and a regular emigration takes place in waggons, on horseback,\r\nor on foot, to the more elevated and therefore more healthy parts of the\r\ntown, to Ryswick, Molenvliet, Weltevreden, &c., where during the last\r\ntwenty years an entirely new and very elegant settlement has sprung up.\r\nHandsome villas rise amid the blooming fragrant gardens, and everything is\r\narranged in accordance with the requirements of a tropical climate; and\r\nof an evening, when the low verandahs and beautifully furnished\r\ndrawing-rooms of these airy, well-ventilated mansions are profusely lit\r\nup, and filled with a gaily-dressed social circle, while numbers of\r\nequipages, carrying torches, flit through the wide streets, the whole\r\nscene has quite a fairyland appearance. The gloom without makes the\r\ndazzling brightness within-doors still more marked, and renders the law a\r\nperfect boon, by which no native, so soon as it becomes dark, is permitted\r\nto walk through the streets unless he carries a lighted torch (_obor_).\r\nOwing to the distance intervening between each house, Batavia, although\r\nnumbering only 70,000 inhabitants, apparently covers a larger area than\r\nParis, and as the wealthy classes are concentrated in the upper quarters\r\nof the town, just as they are in the West End of London, it is there that\r\none may see all that Batavia has to show of luxury, comfort, and elegance.\r\nThe old haughty, aristocratic capital of the Netherland Indies, whose\r\nbeauty once obtained for her the title of \"Queen of the East,\" is found\r\nhere in more than pristine freshness, and not alone in wealth and\r\nsplendour, but even in social stiffness and pedantic etiquette, vies with\r\nthe most ultra-refined centres of fashion in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe _Novara_ had long been expected in Batavia, and months beforehand\r\norders had been issued by the Governor-general to all the Dutch colonies\r\nin the East Indies, for the courteous reception of the Expedition, and\r\nenergetically assisting its members. A German merchant from Celebes, whom\r\nwe happened to meet the day of our arrival, informed us that in Macassar\r\nthe entire population had been for several months past looking for the\r\narrival of the foreign man-of-war, and those on the look-out at the\r\nsignal-station, as often as a large ship made its appearance on the\r\nhorizon, were continually hoping that it might prove to be the\r\nlong-expected visitor.\r\n\r\nAll that the resources of a mighty and generous power, such as is that of\r\nHolland in Java, could furnish to make our short stay at the island as\r\nagreeable and instructive as possible was exhibited on the most lavish\r\nscale, and all that could be done to promote our objects in view by men of\r\nscience, of which Java possesses a considerable number, and even some of\r\nEuropean celebrity, was offered with the most praiseworthy alacrity.\r\nSeveral eminent scholars and naturalists, headed by the renowned\r\nichthyologist, Dr. Bleeker, who shortly before had been decorated with an\r\nAustrian order of merit for his valuable contributions to our knowledge of\r\nthe natural history of the Sunda Islands, did the honours, so to speak,\r\nfor the members of the scientific commission, of whom they became the\r\nconstant companions.\r\n\r\nThe very day we landed we visited the Museum, in the company of our new\r\nfriends, where we found an extremely interesting and most valuable\r\ncollection, principally of ethnographic objects. Here we saw idols of the\r\npalmy days of Buddhism, made of bronze and silver, beautifully carved,\r\nwhich came from the interior of Java, as also from Sumatra and the Engano\r\nIslands; clothes of the bark of trees, garments of fish-scales, of a\r\nspecies of _Scarus_ (probably _Scarus Schlosserii_), head-gear, armlets,\r\nand necklaces of the teeth of men and wild animals, richly adorned\r\n\"creeses\" or Malay daggers, lances and arrows of bamboo, whose iron heads\r\nwere poisoned by a wash of arsenic mixed with lemon-juice; a great variety\r\nof musical instruments, among which were specimens of the well-known and\r\nsingular _Gamelang_, which consists of a row of bells of all sizes and\r\ntones, which are struck with slender pieces of bamboo, and makes a regular\r\norchestra of bells. There was also a very singular-looking collection of\r\nparasols, which as used by the natives are emblems of rank, and of which\r\nthere are no less than thirty different kinds. Any one may carry a simple\r\ngreen, or blue, or black parasol, but those with gold thread or gold\r\ntassels are only permitted to be used by persons of a certain social\r\nstanding, so that one may always know the social position of a Javanese by\r\nthe parasol he carries, just as among the Chinese, rank is indicated by\r\nthe number of peacock feathers, and the colour of the button on the\r\nbonnet. The higher the rank, the broader is the gilded fringe, so that the\r\nparasol of a Javanese prince of the highest rank is all gold together, and\r\nwhen fully expanded consists of three parasols, one above the other, which\r\nopen by one and the same movement. Most of these parasols, prepared from\r\nthe leaves of the screw-pine, are imported hither from China.\r\n\r\nIn one of the rooms is a statue of Durga, one of the goddesses of the old\r\nHindoo mythology, moulded in metal, a present from the Sultan of\r\nSurakarta in the centre of Java to one of the former governors of the\r\nisland, who presented this fine specimen of native art to the Museum. A\r\nlarge number of Javanese and Sunda MSS., written on palm-leaves, have been\r\nplaced by, and at the expense of, the government in the hands of Dr.\r\nFriedrich, a German philologist, to be deciphered and translated. In the\r\nsame apartment we saw a large number of trachytes, with very beautiful\r\nsculptures and inscriptions, as also several figures from the island of\r\nBali, quite modern in aspect, carved in wood and coarsely painted,\r\nrepresenting some beautiful female figures; other hideous caricatures,\r\nwhich are used by the natives as decorations of their household altar, but\r\nwithout any religious significance being attached to them. The fact that\r\nthese sculptures are no longer, as formerly, executed in stone, but are\r\ncarved in wood, may be held to evidence the decay of this branch of art. A\r\nrather considerable craniological collection, comprising some 60 heads of\r\nthe various types of races inhabiting the Malay Archipelago and the\r\nadjoining continent, was in the most handsome manner presented to the\r\nExpedition, and must, considering the many difficulties which stand in the\r\nway of our acquiring correct scientific knowledge of this interesting\r\nquestion, especially among races inhabiting uncivilized countries, be\r\nregarded as an exceedingly valuable addition to our collections of objects\r\nof natural history at home.\r\n\r\nThe Ethnographic Museum and the library attached are, however, only\r\nbranches thrown out by the indefatigable activity of the oldest\r\nscientific society in Java, the _Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en\r\nWetenschappen_, which, founded in 1778 by the Europeans then resident in\r\nBatavia, has since that period published some thirty volumes of valuable\r\nstatistics of the various objects of which it takes cognizance, and is in\r\ncorrespondence with upwards of 150 learned societies. Since 1852 there has\r\nalso appeared under the auspices of this Society, conducted by three\r\nmembers of the direction, Dr. Bleeker, Mr. Netscher, and Mr. Munnich, a\r\nmonthly journal of Indian History, as also of physical and ethnographic\r\nstatistics (the \"_Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal Land en Volkenkunde_\"),\r\nof which seven volumes have already appeared, published in 8vo. Not less\r\nvaluable, especially in the interests of natural science, is the\r\nAssociation known as the \"_Natuurkundige Vereeniging_,\" which has been in\r\nexistence since 1850, and, under the superintendence of that indefatigably\r\nactive scholar Dr. Bleeker, has within that period published a\r\nconsiderable number of most interesting memoirs, while the Society for the\r\nadvancement of Medical Science (_Vereeniging tot Bevordering der\r\nGeneeskundige Wetenschappen in Nederlandsch Indie_), under the guidance of\r\nthe distinguished Dr. G. Wassink, has given to the world through its\r\nannual publications a large variety of experiences and observations on the\r\nstudy of Medicine.[34] All these scientific institutions are the more\r\ndeserving of commendation, when we reflect that there are but 6000\r\nemigrants from Holland, scattered abroad throughout the Netherland\r\nIndies, of whom only some 3000 are in Batavia, and that the white\r\npopulation is for the most part constantly changing. It is obvious this\r\nlatter condition must have this prejudicial effect, that the various\r\nbranches of scientific inquiry cannot always enjoy a uniform degree of\r\nattention, and that the task of maintaining them in a proper degree of\r\nefficiency must depend almost exclusively upon the continuance in office\r\nand constant attention of individuals. Owing to this frequency of change\r\nthe active prosecution of scientific inquiry has undergone marked\r\nfluctuations in Batavia, and while occasionally it was at the lowest ebb,\r\nso to speak, at another time, as happily was the case at the period of our\r\nvisit, it presents, in the convergence of numerous powerful minds devoted\r\nto the pursuit of knowledge, the imposing spectacle of a strong set of\r\npublic opinion towards intellectual enjoyment and cultivation.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Dr. Bleeker the members of the Expedition visited several\r\nof the most interesting of the public institutions, the establishment of\r\nwhich reflects the greatest honour on the government, as well as the\r\npublic-spirited individuals who projected them. The Military and Civil\r\nHospital at Tjiliwoeng, or Great River, does not indeed present the\r\npalace-like appearance of the Misericordia Hospital at Rio, but the small\r\nneat buildings, one storey high, scattered among beautiful flower-gardens,\r\nand occupying a flat space of great extent, are kept scrupulously clean,\r\nand are arranged with great comfort. Six physicians are on duty here, and\r\nthe most exemplary care and attention are bestowed on patients. Officers\r\nand public servants who fall sick have, in particular, large, light, airy,\r\nelegantly furnished apartments; other patients are received into lofty,\r\nwell-ventilated, spacious halls, usually holding from 50 to 60 beds.\r\nAltogether the hospital can accommodate 600 patients. The most common\r\ndiseases are dysentery, intermittent fever, and heart and liver\r\ncomplaints. Here we saw numerous cases of _Beri-Beri_ (the Barbiers of\r\nEnglish medical writers), that singular, usually incurable disease which\r\nbegins with intermittent fever, and generally ends with paralysis of the\r\nspinal chord. In the year 1857, of 500 patients at Batavia no fewer than\r\n348 were attacked with this frightful complaint, of whom 249 died within a\r\nbrief space. In the medical section of the _Novara_ publications will be\r\nfound a complete account of this most interesting malady, which\r\nfortunately is very limited in its ravages, and hitherto has been almost\r\nexclusively confined to the natives.\r\n\r\nIn one of the wards we were shown a Dutch sailor labouring under an\r\nasthmatic attack, whose hands and feet had been shockingly mutilated in\r\n1846 by pirates in the Straits of Malacca. We also found among the\r\npatients several German sailors and soldiers, whose transports of joy were\r\nunmistakeable on hearing once more the sound of their native language, and\r\nat the opportunity of conversing with a fellow-countryman.\r\n\r\nThe heavy expense of building in Batavia, and the anxious vigilance\r\nexercised over those of the community who are sick, will best be\r\nunderstood from the fact that one single new ward, making up from 60 to 80\r\nbeds, cost the government about 60,000 guilders (L5000). One of the\r\nbuildings, at a little distance from the rest, is set apart for female\r\ninvalids, as also for lunatics and sick prisoners. Attached to this\r\nhospital is a school of midwifery for the instruction of native women in\r\nobstetrics, which at the period of our visit was attended by sixteen women\r\nfrom various islands in the Malay Archipelago, and which, in a land where\r\nthe birth of a child is accompanied by so many superstitious and hideous\r\nceremonies, cannot fail to be followed by most beneficial results.\r\n\r\nOne very important and useful establishment is the Javanese medical school\r\n(_Geneeskundige School voor Inlanders_), which, founded in 1851 by Mr.\r\nBosch, at that period chief of the medical staff, is intended to supply\r\nthe sons of the more prominent natives of Java and the adjacent islands\r\nwith a thorough training in and acquaintance with the art of medicine as\r\npractised in Europe. Government defrays the travelling expenses of these\r\nyouths, as also all expenses of maintenance and education. Among the\r\nfour-and-twenty scholars here, we saw sons of native princes of Java,\r\nPalembang, Celebes, Amboina, Ceram, Sumatra, and Borneo, who intended\r\nfollowing up the profession; and it is worthy of remark that two natives\r\nof Menado in the island of Celebes of the savage cannibal race of the\r\nAlfuras, were pointed out to us as among the most apt and docile of the\r\nscholars! Those of the students who are Christians, are clothed in the\r\ndress of Europeans, the rest, chiefly Mahometans, wear Oriental attire.\r\nInstruction is imparted in Malay, since as a rule not one of the students\r\non entering the college understands a word of Dutch. For the same reason\r\nthe books usually employed in instruction cannot be made use of, while,\r\nowing to the poverty of the Malay language, any translation into it must\r\nbe fraught with difficulty. All technical names are therefore converted\r\ninto Latin. The course of instruction is carried on the first year in the\r\nclass-room, the second by the bed-side of the patient, or the dead body.\r\nAfter strict and thorough examination each pupil receives a diploma as a\r\n\"Doctor--Java,\" besides a monthly salary of from L2 2_s._ to L2 10_s._,\r\nand an outfit of the most important drugs and surgical instruments. By\r\nthis system some fifty young men have already returned to their homes as\r\nphysicians and government officials, and thus greatly contribute to the\r\nextension of European civilization.\r\n\r\nIn the chief streets of Batavia the stranger comes upon some small open\r\nwatch-houses, or rather huts, consisting simply of four poles and a roof\r\nof palm thatch, in which is suspended a long, slender piece of wood\r\n(_Tong-tong_), which is used for three different objects. The Javanese who\r\nin this little hut is watching over the property and personal safety of\r\nthe inhabitants, strikes the _Tong-tong_ with a sort of drum-stick, in\r\norder to announce the hours of the night, or to give notice of the\r\noutbreak of a fire, or in case of any one _running a-muck_. This singular\r\nphenomenon, in which a Malay with open knife or drawn dagger rushes madly\r\nthrough the streets, and seeks to kill every one he encounters, occurs\r\nperhaps a dozen times a year. The first murder is very probably\r\nintentional, the offspring of hate or revenge, but that once accomplished,\r\nthe murderer, usually under the influence of opium, runs recklessly\r\nforward through the streets, with the wild cry of \"Amok\"--\"Amok\"\r\n(Kill!--Kill!), knocking down and stabbing whoever he encounters. As one\r\ncan only approach the miscreant at the peril of one's life, there is kept\r\nin these watch-houses a peculiarly constructed weapon of long wooden\r\nstaves, and shaped at the upper end not unlike a hay-fork, with which the\r\ndesperate wretch can be seized. The various methods in which the Tong-tong\r\nis struck at once conveys notice as to which one of the three\r\nannouncements conveyed by the instrument it is the watchman's object to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nThe natives, although they divide themselves into the Java and Sunda\r\nnations, belong nevertheless to the same race, viz. the Malay, and are\r\nreadily recognizable by their short thickset form, round face, wide mouth,\r\nshort narrow nose, small black eyes, by their brown complexion, verging on\r\nyellow, and their luxuriant but always rough and coarse hair. As to their\r\nmoral characteristics, the Javanese are a mild, easily contented,\r\ntemperate, simple, industrious people. The principal occupation of the\r\n10,000,000 inhabitants of Java and Madura, is agriculture, which with\r\nthem is at least equally, if not in a much higher degree, understood by\r\nthem than by any other Asiatic community, with the exception of the\r\nChinese. This is apparent from the neatness and careful cultivation of\r\ntheir fields, the excellent condition of their farm-stock, the careful\r\nobservance of seed-time and harvest, and above all by their regular\r\nirrigation of the soil. When Java first became known to Europeans, the\r\nchief produce of the island consisted of rice, leguminous vegetables,\r\nindigo, and cotton. Intercourse with Europe has superadded to these two\r\nAmerican products, maize and tobacco, and one African, coffee.[35] The\r\nJavanese have even less time for the mechanical arts than for agricultural\r\npursuits, yet in the construction of boats and dwelling-houses, as also in\r\nmaking agricultural implements, shields and weapons of war, they have more\r\naptitude than the majority of the people of the Malay Archipelago.[36] The\r\nonly other stuff, except cotton, of which they make clothing is silk,\r\nchiefly the raw, coarse, Chinese silk; all endeavours to naturalize the\r\nsilk production in these islands having failed hitherto.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ordinary language used for communication and every-day\r\npurposes there are in Java two special idioms,--Javanese in the centre and\r\neast of the island, and Sunda in the west of the island. The small river\r\nLosari in the province of Cheribon on the north side of the island\r\nindicates the boundary line of the two languages. Owing to the\r\ncircumstance that both the idioms are used in Cheribon, many writers have\r\ndeduced thence the origin of the name of that province, which signifies in\r\nJavanese \"mingled,\" or mixed. The Javanese tongue, which of the two is far\r\nthe more highly cultivated, has been a written language for untold ages,\r\nand its alphabet is universally used among the Sunda groups as well as in\r\nthe adjoining Malay groups. Various inscriptions in stone and brass carry\r\nus back in the history of Java to the 12th century, and it would almost\r\nseem that the Javanese at that period had already attained the same degree\r\nof civilization as when four centuries later the Europeans for the first\r\ntime landed on their soil.\r\n\r\nOf the original Javanese language there are three dialects,--the language\r\nof the populace (Ngoko), or low Javanese, the ceremonial language (Kromo),\r\nknown as high Javanese, and the old mystical dialect, or _Kawi_.\r\n\r\nJavanese has borrowed a number of words from Sanscrit, Arabic, and\r\nTelingu, especially since the introduction of religion and commerce.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important events in the history of the Javanese was their\r\nconversion to Brahmanism, and still later to Mahometanism. The precise\r\nperiod at which the first of these took place seems to be as yet quite\r\nuncertain, but this much is known, that from the 13th to the 15th century\r\nBrahmanism prevailed in Java. The conversion of the Javanese to Islam,\r\nwhose religion is at present professed by the great majority of the\r\ninhabitants,[37] took place in 1478 under the ruler of Salivana, after\r\nArabian, Persian, Malay, and Mahometan Hindoos had since the year 1358\r\nvainly endeavoured to introduce that faith.[38]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the native population there is also a large number of\r\nforeign settlers in Java, of whom the Chinese constitute far the largest\r\ncontingent. Their number is above 140,000, and would be much greater were\r\ntheir attempts at colonization not kept down by numerous limitations, and\r\nheavy taxes and imposts. The Chinese, who in more than one respect may be\r\nregarded as the Jews of India, are only admitted by the Indian Government\r\nat certain points of the coast, and in many of the Regencies must not\r\ntransgress those limits. Although they are extraordinarily industrious,\r\ningenious, and well suited for hard labour, yet the government is of\r\nopinion that their unchecked intercourse with the natives would inevitably\r\nprove prejudicial to the latter, who are plundered by the Chinese in every\r\npossible manner. Their main, indeed sole, object is to make money, and at\r\nall public auctions it is they who chiefly buy at a small price, and\r\ndirectly afterwards succeed in getting off their purchases at an enormous\r\nadvance. One can purchase of these Chinese dealers at prices almost\r\nunheard of for cheapness, but quality and lasting capabilities are not\r\nguaranteed. A German writer compares the Kampong or Chinese quarter to a\r\nPolish country town on a fair day. Every house and store is crammed with\r\nall manner of useless trash, and everywhere there is the utmost bustle.\r\nThe most various articles are exposed for sale in each magazine. Here too\r\nare found the Chinese theatrical booths, in which at various hours\r\nthroughout the day Chinese comedians, richly dressed in Chinese fashion,\r\nperform Chinese plays, which are applauded by a numerous ragged auditory,\r\ncollected in the open space in front!\r\n\r\nEach Chinese colony, or _Kampong_, has a chief, appointed by government,\r\nwith the title of lieutenant, captain, or major, available within the\r\nlimits of the Kampong, but which, it is needless to say, confers no\r\nmilitary privileges. Those of the Chinese residing in Java belong to\r\nmutual societies, whose members assist each other, and which have not\r\nmerely humanitarian, but also political tendencies.\r\n\r\nWe are in possession of the affiliation-ticket of a member of the native\r\nChinese society of Hoei, or Tuite-Huy (Brotherhood of the Heavens and the\r\nEarth), printed on a fabric of reddish cotton, which bears 91 various\r\nwritten characters, for the following translation of which, as also for\r\nthe accompanying particulars respecting the objects of this very\r\nremarkable society, we are indebted to the kindness of the renowned\r\nChinese scholar, Professor J. Neumann of Munich:--\r\n\r\n\"The Brotherhood of the Heavens and the Earth frankly declares that it\r\nconsiders itself called on by the Supreme Being to put an end to the\r\nfrightful contrast between wealth and poverty. In its view the possessors\r\nof earthly power and wealth have come into this world under the same\r\nceremonies, and leave it in the same manner, as their defrauded brothers,\r\nthe poor and oppressed. The Supreme Being never willed that millions\r\nshould be held in slavery by a few thousands. Father Heaven and Mother\r\nEarth have never conferred on the few thousands the right to swallow up\r\nthe property of millions of their brethren for the mere satiating their\r\nown luxury. To the rich and powerful their fortunes were never bestowed by\r\nthe Supreme Being as an exceptional right; it consists rather in the\r\nlabour and the 'sweat of the brow' of the millions of their oppressed\r\nbrethren. The sun with his beaming face, the earth with her treasures of\r\nwealth, the universe with all its joys, are boons common to all, and must\r\nbe seized from the grasp of the few thousands for the satisfaction of the\r\nnecessities of the naked millions. The world must ultimately be purged of\r\nall oppression and woe; this must be initiated in brotherly unity, must\r\nbe steadily followed up with mind and hand, and must be completed. The\r\ngood seed of this brotherhood must not be stifled beneath noxious weeds,\r\nrather is it our duty to root up these noxious weeds, that overshadow all\r\nthings, to the benefit and advancement of the good seed. The problem, be\r\nit frankly confessed, is a mighty and a difficult one, but let each man\r\nbethink him, that there is no victory, no redemption without storm and\r\nstrife. Until the great majority of the dwellers of all the cities of each\r\nprovince have taken the oath of fidelity, each man may continue outwardly\r\nto obey the mandarins, and ingratiate himself with the police by presents.\r\nIll-timed demonstrations will injure the plan. So soon as the majority of\r\nthe inhabitants in each city and province has acceded to the bond of our\r\nunion, the old monarchy must fall to the ground, and we shall be able to\r\nfound the new reign upon the ruins of the old. Millions of grateful\r\nbrethren shall honour the founders of our brotherhood after they shall\r\nhave gone to the grave, mindful of the mighty benefit they have\r\nconferred;--the redemption from chains and bondage of a ruined social\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Seal of Union of the Brotherhood of the Heavens and the\r\nEarth.]\r\n\r\nThe seal of union of this Brotherhood of the Heavens and the Earth is\r\nengraved with numerous hieroglyphics, and many-cornered in its inner\r\ncircumference, emblematic of the supreme states of felicity, according to\r\nChinese notions, viz. wisdom, justice, posterity, honour, and riches.\r\nThese five states of felicity correspond to their five elements, earth,\r\nwood, water, metal, fire, whose symbols figure at the corner of the seal.\r\nImmediately below are seen certain other engraved emblems, indicating\r\nmighty undaunted leaders, ancient heroes of China, who are standing\r\nclosely together with unshaken front. Then follow a number of proverbs,\r\npartly of symbolic significance, and in rhythmical sayings, such as:--\r\n\r\n                In close array the ranks of heroes stand,\r\n                Obedient to the master-mind's command.\r\n\r\nOne tie unites the old and the young brethren; in order of battle old and\r\nyoung are intermingled. Each man stands ready to obey the smallest signal\r\nof his immediate commander. As the swollen mountain torrent spreads itself\r\nover the level ground, innumerable bands of these pour forth on all sides:\r\n\r\n                   Mingle brown, and white, and red,\r\n                   And strike till ev'ry foe lie dead.\r\n\r\nThe by-laws of this secret society are so strict that there is hardly an\r\nexample on record of a member incurring a denunciation, or being guilty of\r\ntreason. In consequence of the cloud of mystery which envelopes these\r\nsocieties, they are the more dangerous, because unassailable by the\r\ngovernment. And accordingly, all precautions hitherto taken for\r\nsuppressing these secret societies of the Chinese population have proved\r\nunavailing. Secret societies however are anything but forbidden under\r\nDutch rule in Java,--on the contrary, it is rather _bon ton_ to belong to\r\nsome one of the lodges of freemasonry existent out there.\r\n\r\nBefore setting out on our excursion into the interior of Java, we had an\r\nopportunity of being present at the festivities which it is customary to\r\nget up on the occasion of the reception of an embassy from one of the\r\nnative princes. On the present occasion it was the ministers of the Kings\r\nof the Island of Lombok,[39] eastward of Java, who had to deliver on\r\nbehalf of their illustrious masters letters for H. E. the Governor-general\r\nof the Dutch East Indies. During the whole of their stay they were\r\nmaintained at the expense of government in the house of a specially\r\nappointed master of the ceremonies, a native of the Island of Borneo, and\r\nnephew of the Sultan of Pontianab, whose official position imposes upon\r\nhim the duty of showing all that is worth seeing in the city to these\r\noccasional illustrious Malay guests. Both ministers were accompanied\r\neverywhere by a Malay dolmetsch, although they spoke Javanese with the\r\nutmost fluency, in addition to their mother tongue.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the reception they made their appearance in ceremonial\r\ndress, and in gala \"turn-outs,\" at the government palace, where they were\r\npresented to the Governor-general by the Resident of Batavia, the highest\r\nauthority in the city. The master of the ceremonies took charge of the\r\nletters of the Kings of Lombok, as also of two immense spears, at least\r\ntwelve feet long, each richly gilt and gaily bedecked with yellow\r\ntissue,[40] which were presented by the ambassadors as presents from the\r\nKings of Lombok to the Governor-general. It is however strictly forbidden\r\nto the Dutch employes to accept any presents of the most trifling nature,\r\nand even in cases such as the present, where the refusal of the gifts\r\nwould be an insult to the donor, all such must be sold for the benefit of\r\nthe treasury, or at least a corresponding amount must be returned by the\r\nreceiver out of the state treasury. Accordingly, it is the custom to\r\nrecompense all presents made by the various regents with others of far\r\ngreater value.[41]\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the palace a guard of honour of European soldiers was\r\ndrawn up in full uniform, between whose ranks the ambassadors were ushered\r\ninto the hall of reception. One of the attendants now held a large\r\nrich-looking, highly-gilt parasol above the letter of the Kings of Lombok,\r\nwhich was borne along by the master of the ceremonies on a silver waiter.\r\nA similar mark of distinction was conferred on the two ambassadors and the\r\nresident. The Governor-general in full official uniform, and surrounded by\r\na number of government officials, received the embassy on a platform,\r\nwhere he sat on a beautifully covered gilt chair, canopied with costly\r\ntapestry. The elder of the two ambassadors, having been introduced by the\r\nresident, thereupon proceeded to say that he was charged to present the\r\nhomage of his master to the Dutch Government, and to remit a letter. On a\r\nformal sign by the Governor-general, the government interpreter, Mr.\r\nNitscher, took the letter off the silver waiter, at which moment a salute\r\nof nine cannon-shot was fired in the garden behind the palace, to announce\r\nto the people outdoors the moment at which the king's letter had been\r\nreceived. The letter, enveloped in yellow silk, and written in Malay with\r\nArabic characters, was thereupon opened by the government interpreter, and\r\nread with a loud voice, after which it was translated into Dutch. In a\r\nsimilar manner the reply of the Governor-general was translated for the\r\ntwo ambassadors into the Malay language.\r\n\r\nAt last, after these stiff and wearisome formalities had been gone\r\nthrough, the ambassadors were invited to occupy chairs that had been\r\nspecially prepared for them next the Governor-general, when a short\r\nexchange took place of civilities and commonplace phrases, until the\r\nGovernor-general gave the signal for breaking up, by rising from his seat.\r\nThe ambassadors were thereupon ushered forth in the same ceremonious\r\nmanner in which they had entered.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of the present embassy was a dispute with the Sultan of\r\nSumbawa, in which the Kings of Lombok invoked the mediation of the Dutch\r\nGovernment. The Sultan of Sumbawa had in fact refused to restore two\r\nsubjects of the Kings of Lombok who had fled to Sumbawa. But for the\r\npreponderating influence of the Dutch Government the two disputants would\r\nlong before have resorted to war.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th May we set forth in two large and very comfortable coaches for\r\nBuitenzorg (signifying in Dutch \"on the farther side of sorrow\"), the\r\nusual residence of the Governor-general, who only comes to Batavia on\r\ncertain days in the month to give audiences. He had not alone invited the\r\nmembers of the Expedition to visit the Preanger Regencies as guests of the\r\ngovernment, and caused arrangements to be made for their ascending with as\r\nlittle trouble as possible the volcanic peak of Gunung Pangerango (10,194\r\nfeet), but likewise detached one of his adjutants, M. de Kock, and Dr.\r\nBleeker, both well acquainted with the natural history of the country, to\r\naccompany us upon this excursion. Messengers were sent in advance, to\r\nannounce our approach at each station, so as to secure us a comfortable\r\nand courteous reception wherever we wished to pass a few hours, or to take\r\na night's rest.\r\n\r\nBuitenzorg is distant from the capital 39 paals or Javanese miles,[42]\r\nwhich distance, thanks to the excellence of the roads and the horses in\r\nJava, is traversed in about three hours, two \"loopers,\" or runners, as is\r\nthe custom here, as elsewhere in the East, accompanying each coach, who\r\nare incessantly on and off the waggon, yelling and cracking their long\r\nwhips at the horses to keep them to their speed. About every five paals,\r\nor 4-3/4 miles (English), the cattle and the runners are changed, so that\r\nan unvarying speed is attained. All along the roads stretches the\r\ntelegraphic wire, which unites Batavia in one direction with Angier (75\r\nmiles) and Surabaya (543 miles).[43] The wood of which each post is\r\nconstructed is the _Kapok_ tree, a species of _Gossypium_, or cotton tree,\r\nand here for the first time we saw the slender, tightly-strained wires\r\nsuspended on the stem of a luxuriant green tree. Thus, if the experiment\r\nsucceeds, the elsewhere naked, dead telegraph-poles will here be made at\r\nonce useful and productive, as each post that supports the wire will\r\nproduce a small quantity of cotton.\r\n\r\nBuitenzorg possesses one of the finest and most extensive botanical\r\ngardens in the world. It was laid out as far back as 1817, during the\r\nvice-royalty of Baron van Capellen. The distribution of the various orders\r\nis contrived equally to assist and promote the instruction of the general\r\nobserver, and to accustom the naturalist to the phenomena of Eastern\r\nvegetation. Each order of plants has its own area. The various species of\r\npalms are the most extensively represented, and there is scarcely one of\r\nthe genus, whether ornamental or useful, found in the Netherland Indies\r\nor Australia, of which a representative is not to be found here. The\r\nsuperintendence of this garden has been intrusted to that indefatigable\r\n_hortulanus_, Mr. J. C. Teijsmann, who in his department assisted to the\r\nutmost the objects of the _Novara_ Expedition. He not only presented us\r\nwith duplicates of all the more valuable plants in his very extensive\r\ncollection, but also with valuable seeds. By such kind co-operation we\r\nfound ourselves provided with some twenty various species of fibrous\r\nplants, amongst others the well-known Rame-shrub (_Boehmeria utilis_), and\r\nthat useful species of wild plantain, the _Musa textilis_ (from the leaves\r\nof which is manufactured Manila hemp), as also twenty-four different\r\nspecies of rice. Of these latter two were of special interest, one needing\r\nno watering, but flourishing best in mountainous, dry soil, the other\r\nbeing chiefly used by the natives for the preparation of a dye.\r\n\r\nMr. Teijsmann has the great merit of having been the first to introduce\r\ninto Java the cultivation of the valuable and costly Vanilla plant\r\n(_Vanilla planifolia_), by using artificial means of fructification, after\r\nall the many expensive experiments previously made had failed, because the\r\ninsect which effects the fructification of the plant in its original\r\nclimate, the West Indies, is not found in Java. At present the yield is so\r\ngreat, that not alone does Mr. Teijsmann annually secure and send to\r\nmarket several hundredweights of this aromatic pod, but several other\r\nlandowners have applied themselves to the laying out of Vanilla\r\nplantations. The fruit, from six to ten inches in length, by three to five\r\nlines in width, of a dark brown colour, flexible, and somewhat unctuous to\r\nthe touch, requires about five months to ripen. They are carefully dried,\r\nfirst in the shade and afterwards in the sun, and are then packed away in\r\nbundles in air-tight metal cases. One hundred pounds of fresh pods yield\r\nabout one pound of the Vanilla of commerce. Formerly the value of a pound\r\nof Vanilla was as high as L6 sterling, but it is at present sold at about\r\nL4.\r\n\r\nIn the beautifully situated Hotel Bellevue, where we lived while at\r\nBuitenzorg, we chanced to become acquainted with a curious individual, a\r\nyoung negro named Aquasie Boachi, son of an African prince of Coomassie,\r\nthe chief city of the kingdom of Ashantee on the Gold Coast,[44] who,\r\nwhile a child of nine years, had been sent by the colonial government to\r\nEurope, in order to be educated in Germany. It was the intention to make\r\napparent what early education and instruction can do for the negro, and\r\nhow the present low state of the black race is principally attributable to\r\ntheir oppression hitherto, and to the limited application, in their case,\r\nof European civilization. The experiment proved most satisfactory. Aquasie\r\nBoachi speaks German, English, Dutch, and French quite fluently, and holds\r\na diploma, as mining engineer, from the mining academy of Freiberg in\r\nSaxony. He is a pupil of the celebrated Professor Bernhard Cotta, whom he\r\nstill remembers with affection and gratitude. As Aquasie had become a\r\nChristian he could not, save at the risk of his life, return to his\r\nheathenish native land, to the bosom of his own family. The Dutch\r\nGovernment accordingly, regarding him in the light of a victim to\r\nphilanthropical experiments, at present pays the young miner out of the\r\nstate funds about L400 per ann., and occasionally employs him on mining\r\nresearches. Aquasie had resolved to settle for life in Germany, where, as\r\nhe told us, he felt himself thoroughly at home, but the climate did not\r\nagree with him, upon which he returned to Java, and had since occupied\r\nhimself in coffee-culture.\r\n\r\nFrom the terrace of the hotel one enjoys a magnificent prospect bounded by\r\nthe mountains around. On the right rises a lofty peak, whose summit-cone\r\nhas been cloven into three pinnacles, the Gunung Salak 7204 feet\r\n(English), an extinct volcano, from which, however, in 1699 issued immense\r\nvolumes of sand and mud, accompanied by columns of flames, tremendous\r\nbellowings, and convulsions of the soil. The torrent of liquid mud hurried\r\nalong trunks of trees, carcasses of animals, tame as well as wild,\r\ncrocodiles and fish, and, still preserving its character of a mud torrent,\r\nrushed into the sea near Batavia, stopping up the mouths of several rivers\r\nand brooks. Since then this colossal hill, torn to its innermost core by\r\nthis fearful eruption, has remained silent, and peaceful fields,\r\nalternating with luxuriant forest, stretch upwards to the very flanks of\r\nits once dreaded summit. To the left of Gunung Salak, and in appearance\r\nand elevation far more imposing, stands out the Gedee Range. Its highest\r\npoint is the tapering regular cone of Gunung Pangerango, still further to\r\nthe left of which rises, almost equal in height, the bare rocky wall of\r\nthe still active crater of Gunung Gedeh, from the abyss of which there\r\noccasionally issued light clouds of vapour. But this exquisite landscape\r\nunveils itself to the ravished view of the beholder only during the early\r\nhours of morning. By 10 A.M. thin vapours have gathered round those lofty\r\nsummits, which gradually accumulate as noon approaches, until by 3 P.M.\r\nthere is almost invariably a dense mass of clouds resting over the entire\r\nrange, which very frequently dissolve with fearful violence in the shape\r\nof tremendous tropical thunder-storms. The annual rainfall at Buitenzorg\r\nwould seem to be higher than at any other spot on the face of the earth.\r\nDuring some years it occasionally attains the depth of 200 inches\r\n(English), which is far beyond the utmost known in Central or Southern\r\nAmerica.[45]\r\n\r\nThe evening we spent at the residence of M. Van de Groote, inspector of\r\nthe tin-mines of Banka and Borneo, who was of very great use to the\r\ngeologist of the Expedition, and at whose hospitable house we met a number\r\nof personages of distinction.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning (14th May), before prosecuting our journey, we\r\nmade an excursion to the neighbouring Batoetoelis (pronounced\r\nBatootoolis), as a number of trachytic rocks are called, to which young\r\nJavanese wives, who wish to become mothers, ascribe the most marvellous\r\nvirtues. The inscriptions hewn on the stones have been deciphered by the\r\nGerman philologist, Dr. Friedrich. There is also shown a stone with a\r\ndepression like a human foot, which tradition asserts to be the footstep\r\nof a native prophet, who is supposed to have stood thereon at a time when\r\nthe mass was not yet solid and hardened. There evidently is some\r\nassociation of ideas similar to that of the Cingalese respecting Adam's\r\nPeak, but without the poetic colouring of the latter.\r\n\r\nFrom Buitenzorg we went to Tjipannas,[46] a country-seat of the\r\nGovernor-general, at the foot of Pangerango. The road from Buitenzorg to\r\nTjipannas is part of the great post-road from Batavia to Surabaya, which\r\njust at this point traverses the mountain pass of Mengamendoeng, 4925\r\nfeet high, an outlier of the Gedeh range. It passes at first through\r\nrichly-cultivated properties, with splendid rice-crops, and a little\r\nfurther on through coffee plantations, after which comes uninhabited\r\nwilderness, when the road becomes so steep that a pair of buffalos are\r\nharnessed in front of the horses of each carriage. _En route_ we visited\r\nat Pondok-Gedeh the beautiful property of the family of Van den Bosch,\r\nwhose founder greatly distinguished himself in promoting the agricultural\r\nprosperity of the island, while Governor-general of the colony, 1830-33.\r\nIn the extensive gardens here we saw several large species of _Vanilla_\r\nand _Cactus_ (_Nopal_), the latter of which are devoted to the propagation\r\nand gathering of the diminutive cochineal insect, from which is procured\r\nsuch a valuable dye. In 1826, a pair of this very fecund insect were\r\nbrought from Spain to Java, and at present[47] there are in Pondok-Gedeh\r\nalone 500,000 plants, from which between 10,000 and 20,000 pounds of\r\ncochineal are obtained annually, while other gardens of Nopal of equal\r\nsize occur elsewhere throughout the island. We were also filled with\r\nastonishment at the variety and richness of the brushwood and forest\r\ntrees, which the European is accustomed to see only as diminutive, tender\r\nspecimens, the rare plants of a hot-house! Under the influence of a\r\ntropical climate, and a fruitful soil, the tea plant, the nutmeg, the\r\ncinnamon, the sugar-cane, the coffee bean, and the indigo, all flourish\r\nin wildest profusion, and the various warehouses are as crammed with the\r\nsplendid produce of these valuable colonial staples as our northern\r\ngranaries are with the necessaries of subsistence in the shape of dried\r\nfruits.[48]\r\n\r\nQuite close to Pondok-Gedeh, amid the majestic mountain scenery of Gadok,\r\nis the _maison de Sante_ of Dr. Steenstra Toussaint, which enjoys a\r\nwell-earned reputation under the management of Dr. Bernstein, a German\r\nphysician and naturalist. Invalid residents of the coast, when recovering\r\nfrom climatic diseases, make a point of hurrying to this institution, in\r\norder to benefit by the keen, bracing mountain air. Dr. Bernstein is, as\r\nfar as his professional engagements will admit, at once a zealous\r\ncollector, and a skilful preparer, who has already made some very\r\nbeautiful collections, and who, if he stay here any length of time, will\r\nbe in a position to enrich considerably the museums of natural history in\r\nEurope, with numerous rare and valuable specimens.\r\n\r\nJust at the summit of the pass of Megamendoeng (dark cloud), begin the\r\nPreanger Regencies. This pass moreover forms a boundary line between the\r\nMalay language, chiefly used for commercial transactions along the coast,\r\nand that of Sunda, the difference between which two idioms, as regards the\r\nuninformed stranger is only so far important, that in asking a native for\r\na light for his cigar, he must now say \"Sono,\" instead of \"Api,\" as\r\nhitherto, always supposing that he is a smoker, a qualification which\r\nrarely fails to appertain to the inhabitants of the Dutch East Indies.\r\n\r\nHere, in a wooden building open on all sides, and commanding an exquisite\r\npanoramic view, we partook of a _dejeuner a la fourchette_, prepared quite\r\nin the European style, after which, amidst a drenching thunder-plump, we\r\npursued our course to Tjipannas, which lies about 1000 feet below the\r\nlevel of the pass.\r\n\r\nAt every village we passed, the authorities, as is the custom of the\r\ncountry, provided us with an escort. Thus we almost constantly had some 20\r\nor 30 persons riding behind our carriages. The poor people had indued\r\nthemselves in their best apparel, and looked very pretty in their varied\r\nfantastic attire. Even the rain, which still continued to descend in\r\ntorrents, did not prevent them from following us, in order to do justice\r\nto the requirements of Javanese etiquette. So too, every one whom we met\r\non the road assumed a respectful attitude, resting on the knees in a\r\nhalf-kneeling position, and cowering down in the road with folded hands,\r\ntill our vehicle had rolled by. All the villages we saw had a very neat,\r\nclean, cheerful appearance. The houses of the Javanese (with the exception\r\nof those of the native authorities) are as a rule built entirely of\r\nbamboo, part being of wicker-work, part of the cane placed either side by\r\nside, or above each other, the whole roofed in with palm-leaves, or\r\nAllang grass (_Imperata Allang_), or narrow shingles of cut bamboo, and\r\nwith a flooring raised two or three feet above the level of the soil. The\r\nbeautiful yellow wicker-work is usually stained in alternate squares of so\r\nblack a colour that the walls of a Javanese hut resemble nothing so much\r\nas a gigantic draught-board. Under the eaves of the dwelling, which\r\nproject five or six feet, and is supported in front upon poles, so that\r\nthere is a sort of verandah beneath, are suspended cages with various\r\nfeathered inhabitants, which the Javanese cherish with much tenderness, or\r\nelse a very peculiarly constructed bee-hive, consisting of a bamboo-cane,\r\nsix or nine inches thick by three or four feet in length, which is split\r\nthrough the centre, hollowed out, and fastened together again on the upper\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThrough a small orifice left in front, this artificial cavity is within a\r\nweek or two peopled with a swarm of tiny stingless bees (_Meliporia\r\nminuta_) which in the wild state inhabit the holes and cavities of the\r\ncalcareous cliffs, and provide the Javanese with honey and wax. The latter\r\nproduct is blackish, slimy, and adhesive, and is employed in the\r\ndelineation of the beautifully coloured figures in the gowns (_Sarongs_)\r\nof the native women.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Javanese Bee-hive.]\r\n\r\nAt the station of Tjianjawar, we were saluted, while changing horses, by a\r\nJavanese chief, from Tjiangoer, named Radben Rangga Padma Negara, who,\r\ndespite the tremendous tropical rains, accompanied us on horseback in his\r\nrich uniform, overlaid with gold lace, as far as Tjipannas, where we were\r\nreceived by two government officials, and welcomed with the utmost\r\ncordiality. Here it was arranged we were to pass the night, so as, early\r\nthe following morning, to make the ascent of Gunung Pangerango. We also\r\nfound awaiting us a letter from Dr. Junghuhn, the renowned geologist and\r\nwriter on the natural history of Java, who for years has resided about a\r\nday's journey from Tjipannas, at Lembang, at the foot of Tankuban-Prahu,\r\nand has latterly been engaged by government to superintend the china-plant\r\ncultivation. Dr. Junghuhn had come to meet us as far as Tjipodas, where\r\nthe first attempts at cultivation of the china plant were being made with\r\nroots imported from South America, but, owing to a press of important\r\nbusiness, was compelled to return to his own station before we reached the\r\nPreanger Regencies. This estimable German gentleman urgently besought us,\r\nby letter, to visit him in his forest abode, and painted in the most\r\nglowing colours the wonders of Nature, and the interest in a scientific\r\npoint of view of his mighty mountain neighbour. At the same time he sent\r\nover his learned assistant, Dr. de Vrij, to welcome in his name the\r\nAustrian travellers, to explain to them in all their detail the\r\nCinchona-plantations at the foot of Pangerango, and to enlighten them as\r\nto the present condition and prospects of this very important branch of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 15th May we set off on horseback for the Pangerango,\r\nwhich was covered with dense vapours, which wholly concealed it from view,\r\nand rather damped our hopes of enjoying a fine view from the summit. A\r\npath for horses has been made to the very top, and although at certain\r\npoints this passes over exceedingly steep ground, yet the Javanese horses\r\nclimb with such safety and dogged perseverance, even in the most dangerous\r\nspots, that one may leave these small but powerful animals to choose their\r\nway, with as much confidence as in the case of that most sure-footed of\r\nanimals, the mule of South America. Our cavalcade consisted of thirty\r\nriders, while an immense number of natives took on themselves the duties\r\nof an honorary body-guard. The forests, usually so lonely, were now alive\r\nwith hundreds of men, busy transporting our horses, provisions, couches,\r\ntables, and stores, which were all to be conveyed to the highest peak of\r\nthe mountain, where we intended to spend the evening. After we had\r\nattained a considerable distance from Tjipannas, constantly ascending till\r\nwe were about 4000 feet above it, we found the flanks of the mountain\r\nquite free of wood. The traveller sees a few villages scattered at random,\r\nand rides over grass pasturages, on which are feeding troops of buffalos,\r\nalternating with plantations of tobacco or coffee. But at the very point\r\nwhere the forest gradually begins, where gigantic trees have been left\r\nstanding like so many sentinels, there it is that the amazed European\r\nfalls in with most luxuriant beds of artichokes and strawberries, and is\r\nwelcomed on this distant soil by all the well-known fruits of his remote\r\nhome. The path leads past Tjipodas, into a deep narrow valley, overgrown\r\nwith the most luxuriant vegetation, and thence through a forest of\r\nindescribable majesty, filled with the straight, tapering, pillar-shaped\r\ntrunks, 80 to 100 feet in height, of the imposing Rasamala\r\n(_Liquidambar-Altingiana_), and a thoroughly tropical underwood of wild\r\n_Musaceae_, and splendid tree-ferns, till finally the broad plateau-shaped\r\nTjiburum (red-water) is reached. Here at an elevation of 5100 feet we\r\nfound some Pasanggrahans, or resting-houses, erected by government for the\r\nshelter and accommodation of all travellers through these mountain\r\nsolitudes, who may happen to be surprised by night, or inclement weather.\r\nSuch hostelries are found everywhere in the interior of Java, especially\r\nin those districts where they are most likely to be needed by European\r\ntravellers, or by government employes, during their frequent tours of\r\ninspection, in which they occasionally undergo severe privations. At\r\nTjiburum, lying far above the regions inhabited by man, there is a small\r\nnursery of useful plants of colder climes, bearing ample testimony to the\r\nindefatigable activity of Mr. Teijsmann of Buitenzorg, to whom the\r\ncommunity is moreover chiefly indebted for the laying out of the entire\r\nroad to the summit of the mountain. As there was every indication of a\r\nsevere storm coming on, and as we hoped by pressing forward to get to our\r\ngoal before it should burst, we halted here only long enough to change\r\nhorses. This done we again resumed the ascent, much refreshed by the\r\ndelay, which imparted renewed vigour to climb the steep zig-zag pathway,\r\nwhich now led through a gloomy, silent forest, whence not a sound issued\r\nexcept the _blowing_ of our cattle, as they breasted the steep, and far\r\nbelow us the hollow roar of the mountain brook, which swept through the\r\nvalley beneath. We then found ourselves approaching nearer and nearer to\r\nsome resounding torrent, which went on increasing, till to our amazement\r\nwe suddenly perceived amid the keen cool mountain breezes a smoking\r\ncascade of hot water!! (_Tji-olok_, or Sulphur spring). This warm spring,\r\nwith a temperature of 113 deg. Fahr., which even at its source forms a\r\ntolerable-sized brook, issues with much spluttering from a trachytic rock\r\nclose by the way-side, and rushes, brawling and foaming, down a narrow\r\ndefile, overgrown with splendid tree-ferns, and which is crossed by means\r\nof a slight rustic bridge. Scarcely is it possible to conceive a richer\r\nlandscape, recalling as it were the primeval days of earth in all the\r\nluxuriance of Nature in the flush of youth, than this forest of\r\ntree-ferns, enveloped in clouds of warm vapour, which rise from this\r\nvolcanic spring, close alongside of a clear, cold mountain torrent, which\r\njust here leaps into the same chasm! This hot spring thus early indicates\r\nthe presence of volcanic fires, which is further evidenced by a tract of\r\nvolcanic debris, over which it is necessary to clamber, and which has been\r\nejected by the destructive energies of the neighbouring active crater of\r\nGedeh, from which the subterranean forces usually throw up, not red-hot\r\nlava-streams, but from time to time tremendous stone and mud currents,\r\nwhich, rushing down the steep flanks of the mountain, overrun and destroy\r\neverything around.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 A.M. we reached Kandang Badak, or the spot where rhinoceroses\r\nassemble, which is the second station, 7200 feet above sea-level. Solitary\r\nspecimens of the formidable animals which have given their name to this\r\nplace are still met with here; but a troop of some hundred men,\r\naccompanied by almost as many horses, must necessarily make such a din in\r\nthe usually solitary forest, as at once to account for our being unable by\r\npersonal observation to speak as to whether it deserves the name it has\r\nreceived. The rhinoceros, despite his immense size, is a shy, timid\r\nanimal, who flees before man, and only attacks him when fairly compelled\r\nto do so in self-defence. The Pasanggrahan erected at this spot has\r\nseveral times already been burnt down by red-hot stones ejected from\r\nGedeh. Here the path divides, one branch leading to the still active\r\ncrater of Gedeh, which can only be reached on foot, the other leading to\r\nthe summit of Pangerango. For the second time we changed horses, and now\r\nhad the last bit of the way before us--the steep, almost precipitous, cone\r\nof Pangerango. It was enveloped in thick clouds, and it was only by the\r\nshort windings of the path we could realize that we were riding up an\r\nisolated cone of regular form, the slope of which was between 25 and 30\r\ndegrees. The cool air of these elevated regions now began to make itself\r\nfelt, while our sensations bodily testified to the northern character of\r\nthe vegetation around us. The tree-ferns indeed continued to grow up to\r\nthe very highest point, but long ere reaching the summit they ceased to be\r\nfound among the gigantic forest-pillars of the _Liquid-ambar_, but grew\r\nbetween dwarfish, knotted, stunted trees, whose trunks were overrun with a\r\nbright green moss, while from the branches hung festoons of greyish-green\r\nbeard-moss (_Tillandsia usnioides_), greatly resembling hair. The trees,\r\ninstead of stretching out their brown limbs to the air and light above,\r\nleft them to droop sullenly to the ground, turning themselves, as though\r\nin pain, away from the rude wind which swept through their branches, and,\r\nas it were, seeking for warmth and sustenance from mother Earth alone. All\r\nthe plants here showed a tendency to become creepers, as also to a\r\ncircumscribed growth and extent of foliage, as well as uniformity of\r\nspecies. By 3 P.M. the whole party, including a rear-guard of irregular\r\nnaturalists and sharp-shooters, had finally reached the summit of the\r\nmountain. When Dr. Junghuhn, the first man who trod this solitude, made\r\nthe earliest ascent of this mountain in 1839, he found not a trace of a\r\nhuman step, and had painfully to make his way by rhinoceros-paths, beneath\r\na thick overhanging canopy of leaves, and through dense underwood. Thus he\r\nfinally succeeded in forcing a passage through the forest, till he emerged\r\nupon a naked patch in the middle of the peak, where a rhinoceros was\r\nlying in the middle of the stream, while another was browsing on the edge\r\nof the forest: they fled snorting away on beholding him. How different was\r\nwhat we now witnessed on the same spot!\r\n\r\nThe flat space on the summit, somewhat concave in shape, and sinking\r\ngradually away, the deepest part being towards the S.W., whence issues the\r\nhighest spring in Java, now resembled the bivouac of a detachment of\r\ntroops. Everywhere were men and horses, with cheerful blazing fires for\r\ncooking and warming, while immediately adjoining a strawberry garden\r\nfilled with delicious fruit, rose a hut for shelter against wind and\r\nweather, in which we found a surprising degree of comfort. Tables, chairs,\r\nbeds, excellent provisions and drinkables, were ready for us at an\r\nelevation of more than 9000 feet above the level of the sea, so that there\r\nwas nothing wanting which could in any way contribute to our comfort. Even\r\nthe necessary warmth was supplied by a huge iron stove, constantly kept\r\nsupplied with fresh fuel by a Javanese servant, cowering on the ground.\r\nThis was the more necessary that our systems, accustomed of late to\r\ntropical temperature, were unusually susceptible to this sudden and\r\nextreme change. In the morning when we left Tjipannas the thermometer even\r\nat that early hour marked 70 deg., while the mercury had now sunk to 48 deg.22\r\nFahr. The longings we so often expressed, during a sojourn for months\r\ntogether on the bosom of the ocean, amid the moist, sultry strata of the\r\nlower atmosphere, in an almost unvarying Turkish-bath-like temperature of\r\n86 deg., of being once more re-invigorated by a little cold, were now being\r\ngratified to the letter.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately our anticipated enjoyment of the view from the summit was\r\nentirely frustrated by rain and cloud: we could hardly see anything a\r\nhundred yards distant, and the only idea we could form of the gigantic\r\nmountains and splendid hill-scenery that we knew surrounded us on all\r\nhands, had to be derived chiefly from the topographical charts we found in\r\nthe hut. It was only during the occasional fleeting glimpses, when the\r\nS.E. trade-wind of the upper atmosphere, generally the chief ruler of\r\nthese lofty regions, and almost always accompanied by a pure, blue sky,\r\noverpowered the N.W. trade (which blew from beneath; and, trending upwards\r\nalong the cleft in the western side of the crater of Mondolawangi,\r\ncontinually enveloped anew in clouds the summit of the Pangerango), that\r\nit was permitted us to descry, now here, now there, small stretches of the\r\ncountry lying spread out at our feet, or to perceive closer at hand the\r\ninner slope of the crater of Gedeh, lying exposed to our wondering vision.\r\nWe did what we could to secure a few thermometrical and barometrical\r\nobservations, as also to shoot, to geologize, to botanize; and many a\r\nvaluable discovery was made ere night set in and compelled us to seek\r\nshelter against the raw, cold night air, in the Pasanggrahan, which had\r\nbeen so carefully fitted up for our accommodation. On the summit we found\r\nquite an accumulation of various elegant little plants, which recalled to\r\nus the Alpine districts of our own land, one of which, first discovered\r\nby Junghuhn, and named by him _Primula Imperialis_,[49] is one of the\r\nloveliest flowers in Nature, and which has never yet been found in any\r\nother part of the globe; while in the brushwood around we heard the cooing\r\nof a bird of the thrush species (_Turdus fumidus_), which, with the\r\nexception of a small, very elegant little fellow, somewhat resembling the\r\nwillow-wren, was the sole representative of the feathered tribe in these\r\nelevated regions.\r\n\r\nAll our hopes were now directed towards the ensuing morning, which it was\r\nhoped would bring us better weather. By five in the morning every one was\r\non foot, watching with anxious look the advent of the star of day. But\r\nalas! ere long all was once more enveloped for us in a dense but fine\r\nvapour, and the thermometer indicated only 47 deg.33 Fahr.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty feet higher than the two huts for shelter erected on the\r\nplateau rises a trigonometrical pole, which, visible from a great\r\ndistance, serves as a land-mark for the government surveyors during their\r\nlabours in this neighbourhood. Any clear morning, when the sky is free\r\nfrom clouds, one must enjoy from this free, airy out-look a splendid\r\ndistant view over a large portion of the Preanger Regency. As for\r\nourselves our panorama continued to be lamentably circumscribed, and all\r\nwe could do was, to watch for those fleeting moments during which the\r\nclouds lifted and gave us a brief yet comprehensive glimpse of the\r\nwondrous natural beauty of the surrounding landscape.\r\n\r\nPangerango, 9326 Paris, or 9940 English, feet in height, is the loftiest\r\nof the extinct volcanic cones of Java, rising on the eastern slope of an\r\nenormous crater-gulf, likewise extinct. Close in the vicinity, not above a\r\nmile distant to the S.E., and communicating with it by the ridge of Pasce\r\nAlang, 7000 (Paris) feet in height, rises another volcanic peak, Gunung\r\nGedeh, of almost precisely identical height (9323 Paris, or 9937 English,\r\nfeet). Its summit has fallen in, and from amid the debris on the floor of\r\nthis ruined crater rises a second cone far less in height, but in full\r\nactivity, with a deep crater, which is the true fiery gorge of the still\r\nactive Gedeh. Towards 7 A.M. the clouds dispersed for a considerable\r\nspace, when directly opposite us we saw the beautifully regular cone of\r\nGedeh, with its perpendicular precipitous crater-wall, some 600 or 700\r\nfeet high. So near, indeed, did it appear to the eye that we could almost\r\nfancy it possible to throw a stone from the one summit to the other, so\r\nthat it should fall exactly into the crater, from amid whose rents and\r\ncavities thick volumes of smoke were bursting forth at several points.\r\n\r\nBy 10 A.M. our caravan was once more under weigh on our return to\r\nTjipannas. The geologist of the Expedition, however, accompanied by Dr.\r\nVrij and one of the government employes, set off upon a rather dangerous\r\nadventure, viz. the ascent of the Gedeh. Of this interesting excursion,\r\nDr. Hochstetter gives the following interesting details:--\r\n\r\n\"A short distance before reaching the station of Kandung Badak, the path\r\nleaves the road by which we had come thus far. Here we had to clamber\r\nupwards as best we might, by a narrow path densely overgrown, and\r\nevidently but rarely traversed, till presently we emerged from the forest\r\nupon a tract of loose stone and scoriae, which, sparsely covered with low\r\nbushes and grass, forms the upper portion of the peak of Gedeh. A strong\r\nodour of sulphuretted hydrogen greeted us here, issuing from a Solfatara,\r\nwhich nestled under the true crater in a deep savage cleft of rock. Hot\r\nsulphureous and watery vapours were emitted from among the dark crannies\r\nof the rock, the upper edges of which were coloured yellow with pure\r\nsulphur: with much difficulty we still pressed on, and finally reached the\r\nedge of the ruined crater. What a contrast presented itself here in the\r\nview before us and the landscape behind!\r\n\r\n\"Behind we could see from base to summit clear and unbroken the beautiful\r\nluxuriantly-green well-wooded peak of Pangerango, on whose highest point\r\nstood out near and distinct the trigonometrical pole, or land-mark, while\r\nfrom the forest was heard an occasional musket-shot, sure sign that the\r\ncompany of travellers from the ship were on their way down. On the other\r\nhand, when we cast our eyes forward we saw but dismal desolate groups of\r\ngrey rock, around the lofty amphitheatre-shaped rock wall of the\r\nbroken-down lip of a crater, regularly constructed of pillar-like masses\r\nof trachyte, each sundered from the column immediately adjoining, beneath\r\nwhich was the smoking cone of the active region of the crater, a bare heap\r\nof stone and scoriae, of the utmost variety of colour. Stretching from the\r\nvast abyss of the crater-ruins, on whose bald slope is situated the cone\r\nof the new eruption, there is visible at intervals on either side, far\r\ndown, until indeed it is lost in the dark gloom of the forest, a bare\r\nrocky ravine, full of stones and debris, which the active vent of the\r\ncrater has from time to time vomited forth. We had on the previous day\r\npassed the lower extremity of this stream while riding to Pangerango.\r\n\r\n\"But we were not yet at the goal of our wanderings. We still had to climb\r\nfrom this point, and afterwards to scramble up to the summit of the active\r\ncone. This, however, proved to be much more easy than we had thought when\r\nlooking at it from below, and we arrived without any disaster at the\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\n\"Here then we were standing upon the edge of a yawning crater, in full\r\nactivity! Not a single step forward was it possible for us to make. In\r\nfront of us lay a funnel-shaped slope, 250 feet in depth, the floor of\r\nwhich was covered with mud, in which stood frequent pools of boiling water\r\nof a yellow tinge. The Javanese who accompanied us stated that they had\r\nnever before seen it so quiet, the crater having always been quite full\r\nof steam and vapour. On the present occasion the steam only escaped in\r\nsmall volumes through a few fissures in the sides of the inverted cone,\r\nand more particularly from the cracks and crevices on the exterior of the\r\ncone of scoriae. We could perceive only water, steam, mud, and\r\nsharp-cornered fragments of rock, the debris and rubbish formed by the\r\ndisintegration of the rocky masses thrown up by the crater, but not a\r\ntrace, not a vestige, of any molten stream of lava, heaped up by the\r\npresent crater of Gedeh. The whole history of the activity of this volcano\r\nmay be compared to the explosions of a vapour cauldron in the interior of\r\nthe earth, which has been heated by the masses of old trachytic lava\r\ncurrents in an incandescent state, but not yet thoroughly cooled, whose\r\neruptions formed the principal means of erecting the volcanic cone.\r\nRepeatedly up to our own times has the mountain thrown up water, mud, and\r\nstones, together with fine powdered sand and volcanic ashes, which have\r\ntravelled as far as Batavia, as also masses of melted stone cemented by\r\nliquefied sand, while marvellous volumes of flame were visible to an\r\nimmense distance; but at no period within the memory of man has the Gedeh\r\npoured forth the hot liquid lava, or thrown up into the air melted\r\nvolcanic matter. We must regard it as in its last stage, as about to\r\nbecome extinct, like all the other volcanoes of Java. It is the last\r\nreaction of the internal fires against the atmosphere penetrating from\r\nwithout. Even the most active volcanoes of Java, such as Gunung Guntur and\r\nGunung Lamengan eject only masses of liquefied rock and scoriae, cemented\r\nby the heat, but the regular lava currents have never been observed.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Hochstetter was occupied with this excursion to the active\r\ncrater of Gedeh, the remaining members of the Expedition had reached\r\nTjipodas at the foot of this fire-mountain, where, at an elevation of 4400\r\nfeet above sea-level, and at an annual average temperature of 63 deg.5 Fahr.,\r\nthe first attempts were made to acclimatize in Java the valuable quinquina\r\ntree (_Cinchona sp._).\r\n\r\nAlthough for twenty years past the introduction into Java of the\r\ncultivation of the quinquina tree, the bark of which is of such\r\nsuperlative importance for suffering humanity, had been repeatedly tried,\r\nthis praiseworthy intention was only successfully carried into effect in\r\n1852, through the purchase of a specimen of _Cinchona Calisaya_ from the\r\n_Jardin des Plantes_ at Paris by the then colonial minister of the kingdom\r\nof the Netherlands, M. Pahud, afterwards Governor-general of the Dutch\r\nEast Indies. M. Pahud had the plant brought to Leyden with the utmost\r\ncare, whence it was conveyed to Rotterdam for shipment to Batavia.\r\nImmediately on its arrival this plant, the progenitor of all that have\r\nbeen grown since, was placed in what is called the Governor-general's\r\nstrawberry garden in Tjipodas, where it was protected by a bamboo shed\r\nfrom rain and sun, and at the time of our visit was 16 feet high. Dr.\r\nHasskarl, widely renowned as a botanist, was, on the recommendation of Dr.\r\nJunghuhn, who had himself been urgently requested to undertake the duty,\r\nentrusted with a mission to Peru, whence he was to bring back offshoots,\r\nand germinating seeds, of the various species of Cinchona from which\r\nquinine is obtainable. Two years later, a Dutch man-of-war was specially\r\ndespatched to Callao, the harbour of Lima, to convey Hasskarl with his\r\nvaluable booty. That gentleman accordingly brought away with him four\r\nwell-rooted young trees, and the seeds of four species of Cinchona,[50]\r\nbut only the saplings gave promise of success, whereas the greater part of\r\nthe seeds, on being sown, were lost. M. Hasskarl has had the reproach cast\r\nupon him, that during his expensive residence of two years' duration in\r\nPeru, he should have collected such few data of the higher and lower\r\nlimits of vegetation of the China plant, and the conditions of soil and\r\nmountain temperature under which it best flourishes, of the general\r\ninfluence exercised on it by storm and humidity, as also upon the annual\r\nquantity of rain it requires, whether a shady or sunny place of growth be\r\nbest adapted to it, the period of flowering and fructification, the\r\nalterations which may be rendered necessary by its habits of growth at\r\nvarious points, as to what are its natural enemies, and how far its\r\nalkaloid properties are affected by the greater or less elevation above\r\nthe sea of the spot in which it is growing, &c., &c. Nay, some persons\r\nwent so far as to allege that the botanist had never seen one single\r\nChina plantation, and had never personally selected either the plants or\r\nthe seed, but had made arrangements for being supplied with the specimens\r\nhe brought by means of the native bark-collectors (_Cascarilleros_). As\r\nthough still further to enhance the public discontent with Hasskarl, and\r\nthe failure of his expensive mission, fate unhappily willed that his wife,\r\nwho was said to be bringing with her his papers and memoranda of his stay\r\nin Peru, was lost, together with the vessel which, after several years'\r\nseparation from her husband, was about restoring her to his arms, in\r\nconsequence of which many questions relating to the cultivation of the\r\nChina plant in northern and southern Peru remained unanswered! Hasskarl\r\nere long returned to Europe \"for his health,\" and the superintendence of\r\nthe China cultivation was in June, 1858, committed to Dr. Junghuhn, in\r\nwhose careful charge it now is, and has taken a start which leaves no room\r\nto doubt its ultimate and permanent success.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1856, there were in Tjipodas 105 China trees of 2 feet 6\r\ninches high (41 of _C. Calisaya_, 64 of _C. Condanimea_). On 31st October,\r\n1857, there were only 95 about 4 feet 11-1/2 inches in height, all in\r\nflourishing condition, while 10 had died. The cause of this lamentable\r\nphenomenon could not long escape the piercing glance of Junghuhn. The\r\nfirst tender shoots had been planted in a Tufa soil, the fertile covering\r\nof which barely exceeded 6 to 9 inches in thickness, and were surrounded\r\nby roots and stumps of immense forest trees that had been cut down, which\r\nof course prevented anything like expansion, and, in a word, completely\r\nstifled their growth.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the earlier plants, there was far too little attention paid\r\nto the requisite amount of shade. The timber had been entirely cleared\r\naway, and the young plants were consequently exposed during the whole day\r\nto the fierce heat of the tropics. Unless people were prepared to see the\r\nwhole plantation go to ruin it was necessary at once to take protecting\r\nmeasures against it. Junghuhn was a man fit for any emergency, as he had\r\nalready shown on the banks of his native Rhine, when the very cells of\r\nEhrenbreitstein, with which a chivalric adventure had made him acquainted\r\nin his youth, had for once been found too narrow to hold him. So in\r\nTjipodas, the man of resources was able at once to devise a remedy. With\r\nincredible toil, and the most fostering care and attention, nearly all the\r\ntrees were, without detriment to one single twig, transplanted from a soil\r\nso little congenial to them to the adjoining Rasamala-wood, in which the\r\nproud, slight _Liquid-ambar Altingiana_ imparts its own peculiar character\r\nto the primeval forest, where they were transferred to spots partly\r\nshaded, which had already been prepared for their special reception, the\r\nsites having been surrounded with trenches to carry off the superfluous\r\nwater. In October, 1857, some of the trees had already attained a height\r\nof 14-1/2 feet; by 31st March of the following year they were already\r\n15-1/2 feet, while their stems were 3.44 inches thick. Many of the trees\r\nplanted near the forest had within three months grown from 9 to 21\r\ninches, while the few that remained on their old site had only gained 9 or\r\n10 inches in height, a fact which seemed incontestably to prove that the\r\nnew site was the better adapted to them. In June, 1857, the first blossom\r\nhad made its appearance on one of the _Condanimea_, but it was not till\r\nMay, 1858, that the majority of the trees were in full bloom, or that the\r\nripening fruit began to make its appearance. When all the fruits ripen,\r\nDr. Junghuhn told us he was in hopes he would secure 80,000 fruit, which,\r\nas each fruit contains about 40 seeds, would provide him with 3,200,000\r\nseedlings. It is not indeed a question merely of ripe and at the same time\r\nfertilized seeds, but chiefly whether the bark of this plant contains in\r\nthe land of its adoption, and under different conditions, that costly\r\nalkaloid quinine, which seems daily to become more indispensable in the\r\nscience of medicine.\r\n\r\nDespite the most anxious solicitude there had long been remarked in\r\nTjipodas a gradual decay of some of the shoots, but it was only a few days\r\nbefore our arrival that after a most minute zealous inquiry the cause of\r\nthis phenomenon was discovered. A minute insect, scarcely 1/25 of an inch\r\nin length, of the _Bostrichus_ species, proved to be the foe of these\r\nplants. The holes which are burrowed by this insect, are drilled quite\r\nthrough the wood of the stem and branches into the very pith, in which it\r\nfinally stops and lays its eggs. The Cinchona trees thus bored through are\r\nirremediably ruined, but there is always the hope that, as the roots\r\nremain sound, they may afterwards put forth new shoots. However, the\r\nappearance of this insect does not seem to be the primary cause of the\r\ndisease of the trees,--on the contrary, disease is the cause of the\r\nappearance of the insect. If the other trees prove to be successfully\r\nreared, the insect will disappear, since it was convincingly proved by one\r\nof our zoologists that it had not come to the country with the Cinchona\r\nseeds and plants, but was undoubtedly indigenous to Java.\r\n\r\nAltogether there were, in May, 1858, upon the whole island three quinquina\r\nplantations, which have been specially established with a view to the\r\nsolution of certain questions of climate at various elevations, and are\r\nsituated in the following localities:--\r\n\r\n1. In Tjipodas at the foot of Gunung Gedeh (4400 to 4800 feet above\r\nsea-level), in a beautiful Liquid-ambar forest, and containing 80 plants.\r\n\r\n2. In Bengalenzong, on the declivities of the Malabar Range (4000 to 7000\r\nfeet in height), in the midst of a considerable oak forest (_Quercus\r\nfagifolia_), containing 600 plants.\r\n\r\n3. South of Besuki on the Ajang Range (about 6800 feet above sea-level),\r\nin a plantation[51] containing 21 plants, to which Dr. Junghuhn gave the\r\nname of Wono Djampie, i. e. Forest of medicines.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Government has spared neither trouble nor expense, and has made\r\nconsiderable sacrifices, to bring over the quinquina plant from its native\r\ncountry, where it was believed to be threatened with utter destruction, to\r\nJava, there to be acclimatized. The chances in favour of an adequate\r\nreturn are very great, and the attainment of this object has been secured\r\nwithin certain limits. Of all the tropical regions we visited, the Island\r\nof Java seems by its natural advantages to be the best capable of\r\naffording to the tree which produces the febrifuge bark, so invaluable a\r\nboon of nature to suffering humanity, a second home, amid the magnificent\r\nscenery of its mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nHowever, the wide-spread idea that the China plant is exposed to utter\r\nextinction in its native land of Peru has proved to be quite unfounded. We\r\nshall revert to this subject when we come to treat of our visit to the\r\nwestern coast of South America, and shall take pains to solve at least\r\nsome portion of the question in dispute, as to certain necessary\r\nconditions being requisite to be observed in the case of the quinquina\r\nplant in its original home, the investigation of which, the superintendent\r\nof the quinquina tree culture in Java, Dr. Franz Junghuhn, so earnestly\r\ncommended to the attention of the scientific members of the _Novara_\r\nExpedition.\r\n\r\nHowever, our interest was not confined to these China-tree plantations;\r\nour attention was riveted by the marvellous Rasamala (Liquid-ambar) forest\r\nin which we now found ourselves, while those fond of the chase were not\r\nless amazed and gratified, at bringing down a splendid specimen of what\r\nis known as the Kalong or Roussette Bat (_Pteropus vulgaris_). These\r\nsingular nocturnal animals hang in enormous quantities throughout the\r\nentire day from the branches of the trees, amid the profoundest stillness,\r\ntill evening sets in and dismisses them to their nightly evolutions. They\r\nare then visible flying through the air like gigantic bats, or flying\r\nfoxes.\r\n\r\nWhile riding back to Tjipannas we remarked amid the smiling rice fields\r\nseveral poles with hangings of various kinds, resembling those erected on\r\nthe shore in front of their huts by the superstitious natives of the\r\nNicobar Islands, in order to keep his Satanic Majesty at a distance. The\r\nnatives call these poles Tundang-Setan (talisman against the devil), and\r\nbelieve they can by their aid frighten away the evil spirits, while they\r\nare gathering the crop from their rice fields.\r\n\r\nFrom Tjipodas the excursionists proceeded to Tjiangoer,[52] the present\r\ncapital of the Preanger Regency, containing about 15,000 inhabitants,\r\nwhere some days were to be spent in excursions, collections, hunting, and\r\nother amusements, after which we were compelled by the limited time\r\navailable to return to Buitenzorg and Batavia. Two members of the\r\nExpedition, Drs. Hochstetter and Scherzer, penetrated a little further\r\ninto the interior, with the purpose of paying a visit to Dr. Junghuhn, to\r\nwhose researches in the Natural History of Java we are so much indebted.\r\nThe following few pages are devoted to an account of this interesting\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\nTowards 5 P.M. we arrived at Tjiangoer, in company with Dr. de Vrij and M.\r\nVollenhoven, and immediately set out on our journey to Bandong, so as to\r\nreach the same evening that neat little town, whose singularly favourable\r\nposition, almost exactly in the centre of the Regency, makes it a\r\ndangerous rival to Tjiangoer as the seat of government. _En route_ we\r\npassed Tjisokan, a small village, most of whose inhabitants are engaged in\r\nprocuring edible swallows'-nests, which are found in great quantities at a\r\nchalk mountain about twelve miles distant, known as Radjamandula.[53] The\r\nspots at which the edible nests of the _Hirundo esculenta_ are found are\r\nanything but grottoes peculiar to this product, as is usually alleged, but\r\nsteep, almost inaccessible, cliffs, crannies, and fissures in the rock, in\r\nwhich the swallows build their nests, and which can only be reached by the\r\nutmost exertion, frequently accompanied by danger to life. They are met\r\nwith partly upon the south coast, close above the raging surf, partly deep\r\nin the interior, about 2000 feet above the level of the sea, distant\r\nseveral hundred English miles from the nearest part of the sea-shore; and\r\nwhile the inhabitants of Karangbolong have to scale the almost\r\nperpendicular coast-wall by means of ladders[54] of Rotang (_Calamus\r\nRotang_) and Bamboo, ere they can reach the entrance of the cavern, the\r\nnatives of Bandong, on the contrary, are compelled to climb up to a yet\r\ngreater elevation among the precipices and rocks, ere they are able to\r\nreach the openings that lead to the various hollows.\r\n\r\nWhile the birds are breeding, or if they have their young, which happens\r\nfour times each year, one half remain in the cavities, and both males and\r\nfemales take their turns in sitting to brood, every six hours. Each nest\r\nis inhabited by a pair of swallows, so that if 1000 nests are found in a\r\ncave, they are inhabited by 2000 grown swallows (half male, half female).\r\nThe fecundity of this bird is so great, that, although the nests are\r\ngathered four times a year, and that somewhere about a million of their\r\nprogeny is at each plucking wasted or destroyed by the collectors, they\r\nnever seem to diminish. The six caves at Bandong give yearly about 14,000\r\nnests, that at Karangbolong about 500,000: one hundred nests weigh about\r\none _catty_ (1-1/4 lb.), and one hundred catties (125 lbs.) make one\r\n_picul_.[55] For each picul of these nests, which they look upon as a\r\nspecial delicacy, the Chinese pay from 4000 to 5000 guilders (L350 to\r\nL420). The nest-gatherers are apparently a special class, whose occupation\r\nis handed down from father to son.\r\n\r\nClose to the village of Tjisokan, a very elegant wooden bridge,\r\nconstructed on the American system, but entirely erected out of the\r\nresources of the colony, has been thrown over the Tjisokan river. The\r\nroads, although broad and kept in excellent order, nevertheless lead\r\noccasionally over hills so steep, that to descend them in a heavy\r\ncarriage, especially considering the rapidity with which the Javanese\r\ndrive, is exceedingly uncomfortable, and even dangerous, although the\r\nwheels are in such cases provided with a solid \"_sabot_,\" and where this\r\nseems likely to prove inadequate, a number of natives hang on to the\r\nwheels behind, who for a small gratuity control the rate of descent by\r\nmeans of ropes.\r\n\r\nAt last, about midnight, shortly before which we passed the river\r\nTji-Tarum by a ferry, we reached Bandong, and on gaining the residence of\r\nthe Javanese Regent, Raden Adipati Wira Nata Kusuma (spelt by the Dutch\r\n_Koesoema_, but pronounced as spelt in the text), were received,\r\nnotwithstanding the lateness of the hour, in the most hospitable and\r\nfriendly manner. Here we found everything, even to the minutest detail,\r\nmanaged in the European fashion; and no guest would imagine that he was in\r\nthe house of one of the Mahometan princes of Java, were he not reminded of\r\nthe fact by the rich Oriental costume of his host and his family, as also\r\nby the Javanese domestics, bearing elegant richly-adorned Siri, or\r\nbetel-boxes, of gold or silver, and invariably tendering their services to\r\ntheir masters in a stooping posture, or rather sliding after them upon\r\ntheir knees. For the Javanese, too, greatly affect the leaf of the betel,\r\nmingled with powdered areca-nut, powdered coral, or pearl chalk, and\r\nGambir (_Nauclea Gambir_); however, this mixture is not chewed, but\r\nplaced between the lips and the front teeth, where it is barely kept long\r\nenough to admit of the saliva collecting in the mouth of a blood-red\r\ncolour, which they spit out, the poor in their huts into cocoa-nut shells,\r\nthe wealthier classes into copper vessels, but princes and rich people\r\ninto golden spittoons. Even the ladies have given way to this custom, and\r\nthe native belles make use occasionally of this filthy juice in order to\r\nkeep importunate admirers at a distance!\r\n\r\nSupper, which, in anticipation of our arrival, had been made ready for us,\r\nwas served entirely in the European mode, and our Mahometan host went so\r\nfar in his assimilation to Western ideas as to overcome certain religious\r\nscruples, and himself join us at table. As we sat round the board long\r\nafter midnight the Assistant Resident of the district made his appearance,\r\nM. Visscher van Gaasbeek, a Hanoverian by birth, who however has lived\r\ntwenty-five years in this country, and immediately placed himself entirely\r\nat our disposal. We now proceeded to chalk out our plan of operations for\r\nthe ensuing day, and the Regent gave orders in advance to have in\r\nreadiness his own coach and several saddle-horses for an excursion to\r\nLembang, the residence of M. Junghuhn. Before we separated, the Regent,\r\nwith whom unfortunately we could only communicate through a Malay\r\ninterpreter, with much condescension produced out of a leathern case his\r\nown elegantly-engraved _carte-de-visite_, and expressed his desire to\r\nexchange with ourselves. The Javanese princes seem to attach especial\r\nimportance to anticipating the Europeans in good-breeding, and\r\nforestalling the desires and wishes of strangers. At last, towards 2 A.M.,\r\nwe went to rest, and despite the fatigue of the previous day, were by 5\r\nA.M. seated in the carriage of the Regent, _en route_ to the residence of\r\nDr. Junghuhn. We drove the two first posts, about 10 _paals_, when we\r\nexchanged that mode of conveyance for our horses, which in less than an\r\nhour brought us to Lembang, situated about 4000 feet above sea-level, in\r\nan almost European climate. Standing alone close to this village is the\r\nbeautiful dwelling of Junghuhn, at the foot of the volcano Tangkuban\r\nPrahu, and surrounded on all sides by beautifully-laid-out gardens, in\r\nwhich, cut off from the scientific world, he lives with his family.\r\nEverything around gives to the stranger a thoroughly home-feeling; in\r\nevery countenance is visible content, in every glance the most heart-felt\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\nFranz Junghuhn, a German by birth, from the district of Mansfeld in the\r\nHarz-mountains, saw many years hard service as a military surgeon in the\r\nservice of the Dutch Government, and at present holds the appointments of\r\nInspector of Scientific Explorations, and Director of the entire\r\nChina-tree cultivation of the Island of Java, with ample means for the\r\nsolution of this problem. This indefatigable naturalist (of whom there is\r\nan excellent engraving at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew), to whom\r\nscience is indebted for the most comprehensive information relating to\r\nJava, has himself ascended 45 different volcanic peaks, and that at a\r\nperiod when there were no bridle-roads leading to their foot, but only\r\nthose singular zig-zag paths which the rhinoceros has worn for himself, in\r\norder to browse at his leisure and undisturbed on the roots and rich grass\r\nof these lofty pastures. His imposing exterior and expression of\r\ncountenance all betoken the indefatigable perseverance and gigantic\r\npowers, both physical and intellectual, which find expression in his\r\nincomparable work upon Java, and his great chart of that island.\r\n\r\nThe renowned _savant_ received us like old friends, with the most\r\ndelightful fervent hospitality, related to us his very latest experiments\r\nand observations with respect to the cultivation of the quinquina plant,\r\nand presented us with his last work,[56] to which he seemed exclusively to\r\ndevote his entire activity. For our own part, we in return promised Dr.\r\nJunghuhn to make most special inquiries upon the subject during the period\r\nof our stay in the native country of the Cinchona, and to endeavour to be\r\nable to answer to the questions we were charged with; as by so doing we\r\nhoped to repay in some degree our tribute of gratitude, for the countless\r\ninstances of personal interest and attention which had been shown us by\r\nthe scientific gentlemen in Java, as well as by all the government\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nAdjoining Junghuhn's dwelling, a large proportion of the coffee beans\r\nraised in the Preanger district are prepared for the European market. The\r\nGovernment has farmed the process to one M. Phlippan, and first deals with\r\nthe beans when, packed in sacks, they are ready for exportation. The\r\nentire coffee crop of the environs of Bandong, averaging about 80,000\r\npiculs (or 10,000,000 lbs.), is conveyed annually over the hills to\r\nLembang, where the fleshy berries are first shelled and made ready. For\r\nthis purpose they use the Brazilian or moist mode of treatment, by which\r\nprocess, however, according to the opinion of connoisseurs in coffee\r\nbeans, much of their flavour must be lost. But, instead of attributing the\r\nwell-marked decrease of flavour of the Java coffee bean to this mode of\r\npreparation,[57] others are disposed to find the cause of this\r\ndeterioration in degeneration of the coffee-shrub itself, and accordingly\r\nthe Dutch Government sent out to Java the well-known botanist Professor\r\nVriese (with appointments[58] which must appear almost fabulous to a\r\nGerman botanist), in order to determine upon scientific data the cause of\r\nthe falling off of the coffee bean. The sending out to Java a Professor of\r\nthe University of Leyden, who had never before been in the Dutch East\r\nIndies, in order to enlighten the practical coffee planters, already on\r\nthe spot, as to the deterioration of that plant, made anything but a\r\nfavourable impression. Some bitter wags, indeed, of whom there is no lack\r\nin Java, any more than of Punches or Charivari at home, said that the\r\nmission of Professor Vriese was as singular as if a native Javanese had\r\nbeen despatched to Holland in order to teach the farmers there how to make\r\n_cheese_.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the solution of this question of the degeneracy of the\r\ncoffee is of the very highest importance to the country, as it produces\r\nannually about 800,000 piculs (100,000,000 lbs.) coffee beans,[59] and as\r\nits climate and soil are eminently suitable for a far more extended\r\ndevelopment of that branch of cultivation, which was first introduced from\r\nMocha into Java, about 1718, by the then Governor, Hendrik\r\nZwoardecroon.[60] The entire coffee crop must be delivered by the coffee\r\nplanters to the Government at a fixed price, and while paying in the\r\ninterior 3-1/2 guilders (5_s._ 10_d._) per picul (125 lbs.), it fetches in\r\nBatavia, where the people are far more heavily taxed, 9 guilders (15_s._)\r\nper picul. The Netherlands Trading Company (_Nederlandsche\r\nHandels-Maatschappy_), which possesses the sole right of shipment, pays\r\nthe Dutch Government from 28 to 30 guilders (46_s._ 8_d._ to 50_s._) per\r\npicul of coffee, which it sells in the European market for its own\r\naccount. How thoroughly such a monopoly must check the growth of trade and\r\ncommerce may be best seen in the stagnation of haughty old Batavia, as\r\ncompared with the youthful, flourishing free port of Singapore. The Dutch\r\nGovernment has, however, within the last few years taken a stride in the\r\ndirection of liberalism, and has thrown open a portion of the products of\r\nthe Island (as, for example, sugar, the whole of which Government itself\r\nhad hitherto sent to Holland) to public auction on the spot; and it is\r\nhoped this system may ultimately be extended to other colonial products,\r\nespecially coffee, and that a little later, not alone Batavia, Samarang,\r\nand Soerabaya may be declared free, but that all the harbours may be\r\nthrown open to free trade. With this question of free interchange of\r\ncommodities is intimately bound up that of compulsory labour, which\r\nconsists in the natives of the interior being compelled to work for the\r\nGovernment at certain fixed rates. In all districts where the Government\r\nowns coffee or other plantations, the cultivation of these must be\r\nattended to by the natives of the nearest villages, for a remuneration\r\nfixed by the Government. The coolies or porters must, for the fixed price\r\nof 2-1/2 or 3 doits per paal, carry goods or do service as runners or\r\nmessengers, while free labour is at least four times as dear. A party,\r\nstrongly supported at home, has arisen in Java, advocating the doing away\r\nwith compulsory labour throughout the island, but, owing to the many\r\nimportant interests imperilled by such a policy, it has been very\r\ngenerally repudiated. It is impossible in Java to broach the topic of\r\ndoing away with compulsory servitude without inaugurating an envenomed\r\ndiscussion. For this question concerns many planters and Government\r\nofficials not less closely than that of the abolition of slavery does the\r\nplanters of the southern States of America. On this point we have heard\r\nsuch widely different opinions pronounced by experienced, thoughtful,\r\nimpartial men, that we are the less disposed to express, on the occasion\r\nof so short a visit as ours, any decided sentiments, since such would have\r\nprobably been entirely changed, or at all events modified, if we had lived\r\nall our lives among the natives, and had become better acquainted with\r\ntheir customs and peculiarities of character.\r\n\r\nIt is believed--such at least is the general impression--that in a land so\r\nfavoured by Nature as Java there is but little to be hoped for from free\r\nlabour, as the requirements of the natives are very limited, and easily\r\nsatisfied. Abandoned to his own impulses of activity, the Javanese would\r\nonly work sufficiently to supply what was necessary for his mere\r\nsubsistence, or would only perform any extra duties so long as the\r\nimposition of regular labour does not set itself in direct antagonism with\r\nhis docile, gentle disposition. The manners and customs of the country,\r\nthe condition of the populace relative to their princes and chiefs, are\r\nfavourable to the condition of forced labour, in which they have been\r\nconfirmed by their Dutch conquerors, thus rendering it less perceptible\r\nand intolerable. It is patent to all that since the introduction in 1830\r\nby General Van den Bosch of the Culture system, or system of compulsory\r\nlabour, the internal state of the colony has enormously benefited,[61] and\r\nthe revenues of the Government increased in a most extraordinary degree.\r\nIn fact, what is known as the _Batig Stal_, or balance of the colonial\r\nadministration for the past year (1859), gave a total of 41,000,000\r\nguilders (L3,416,000). But the pecuniary profits which the State Treasury\r\nwrings from the labour of its subjects are, unfortunately (as was amply\r\nproved in the South American colonies during the days of Spanish\r\nascendency), not always a correct standard of the prosperity of a country\r\nor of the felicity of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn company of Dr. Vrij the geologist of our Expedition ascended from\r\nLembang the volcano of Tangkuban Prahu, whence, following an excellent\r\nroute of travel drawn up by Dr. Junghuhn, he was enabled to visit all the\r\nmore important points of geological interest in the Preanger Regency. Of\r\nthese two highly interesting excursions, which derived an additional charm\r\nfrom the cordial hospitality of the Javanese princes, we borrow from Dr.\r\nHochstetter's memoranda the following particulars:--\r\n\r\n\"On the northern side of the table-land of Bandong, which is a veritable\r\ngarden of Eden, hemmed in by roaring volcanic mountains, there rises a\r\nmountain-chain 6000 feet above the level of the sea, and 4000 above the\r\nlofty plateau of Bandong. In this range three peaks are conspicuous. The\r\nnative, accustomed to indicate each majestic natural feature of his lovely\r\nnative land by some name which gives a clear idea of its peculiar\r\ncharacter, or expresses the emotion it makes upon his senses, has named\r\nthe easternmost truncated conical peak Gunung Tungul (7800 feet), that is,\r\nthe Broken Stump or Tree, and affirms that the long central ridge of\r\nTangkuban Prahu (6427 feet), or the Inverted Boat, was formed by the\r\noverturned trunk of the tree, while the third very serrated peak, the\r\nBuranguang (5690 feet), or Boughs of the Tree, forms the crown of the tree\r\nwith its branches and twigs. Only the long central ridge, the actual hill,\r\nthough its shape would not readily lead us to suppose so, is at this day\r\nan active volcano. Its crater is one of the most extraordinary spectacles\r\nin the volcanic system of Java. Formerly it was necessary to follow in the\r\ntracks of the rhinoceroses up the sides of this mountain, and the ascent\r\nwas not indeed without danger, since it occasionally happened that the\r\ntraveller, while treading some of these funnel-shaped, narrow, tremendous\r\ndefiles, unexpectedly found himself at some sudden turn face to face with\r\none of these gigantic animals, and that, with a precipice on one hand and\r\na wall of rock on the other, there was no visible means of escaping. Under\r\nsuch circumstances there was nothing for it but to fight for life and\r\ndeath, until the stronger marched over the corpse of the weaker. At\r\npresent an excellent bridle-path leads from Lembang to the summit of the\r\nmountain, for the construction of which the community is indebted to Dr.\r\nJunghuhn.\r\n\r\n\"On the morning of 18th May we set out from Lembang for the summit of\r\nTangkuban Prahu, in company with Dr. de Vrij. The Regent of Bandong had\r\nsent us capital horses of the pure Macassar race, and, followed by a crowd\r\nof well-disciplined Sundanese, we at length after a two hours' ride stood\r\nat the edge of the crater.\r\n\r\n\"Dense clouds of vapour filled the abyss below, from which at a\r\nconsiderable depth and in various directions issued the most appalling\r\nsounds, as though hundreds of steam engines were sobbing at work far\r\nbeneath us, or like the broken sound of water falling in spray from a\r\ngreat height upon the rocks. Some dead trees standing on the brink of the\r\nabyss had a blackened appearance as though they had been charred, which we\r\nascribed to the sulphureous vapours, that must be evolved with most\r\ndestructive power when the crater is in full activity. Into this hideous\r\nabyss we now prepared to descend, by a narrow, steep ledge of the rock,\r\nwhich gradually lost itself among the vapour between two perpendicular,\r\nprecipitous walls. We followed the Javanese, who were scrambling down\r\nbefore us, having ourselves given orders to be conducted if possible to\r\nthe bottom of the crater, and therefore continued on as best we could,\r\nconfident that those people had already often descended into the depths to\r\nget themselves sulphur.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately the vapours dispersed during our arduous clamber, and there\r\nat one view lay plain before us the fearful chasm from its floor to the\r\nrim running round it. With amazement and surprise, we perceived that the\r\nledge on which we stood was but a narrow central ridge, separating two\r\ndeep nearly circular volcanic cauldrons, which were both surrounded by a\r\nlofty ellipse-shaped crater-wall! There was also a singular double or twin\r\ncrater. In both cavities, right and left, white clouds of steam rose\r\nhissing and sputtering to the height of the rim. In the left-hand or\r\nwestern crater, which the natives called _Kawah Upas_, or the Poison\r\nCrater, we perceived in the midst of the smoking _solfataras_ a tranquil\r\npool of water of a sulphur-yellow hue, while the lofty internal slopes of\r\nthe crater, nearly 1000 feet high, were densely covered with brushwood,\r\ndown almost to the bottom. Very different was the eastern crater, _Kawah\r\nRatu_, or King's Crater; its floor seemed to consist of dried mud, from\r\nthe clefts and springs in which steam and sulphureous vapours were\r\nconstantly bursting impetuously forth. The wall of this crater, not above\r\n500 or 600 feet high, was naked and bare to the very summit. At the first\r\nglance one could almost fancy he gazed on an expanse of snow amid a green\r\nforest, so bleached and greyish-white did everything look, owing to the\r\nrocks being pulverized and changed by the vapours which continually issued\r\nfrom the soil. Above these white desolate masses of rock were\r\ndistinguishable the blackened, charred, knotted stems of bushes and trunks\r\nof trees, the relics of the vegetation formerly here, tokens of the last\r\neruption in 1846, in which this King's Crater threw up boiling mud,\r\nimpregnated with sulphur, besides sand and stones, till throughout an\r\nextended area the green forests on every side were killed or desolated.\r\nAlready however the rich green of the fern, and the _Thibaudia_ (not\r\nunlike our own whortleberry), is seen shooting up amidst the bare stones,\r\nin close proximity to the blackened trees and shrubs, charred and altered\r\nby the action of the sulphureous vapours and the soil, impregnated as it\r\nis with sulphur.\r\n\r\n\"Continuing to scramble forward, we reached in safety the floor of the\r\nPoison Crater, and had to observe the greatest vigilance, for the entire\r\nground around the boiling lake in the crater to the steep walls consists\r\nof nothing but smoking solfataras, or a dense crust of sulphur, full of\r\nholes and fissures, over the cooled surface of which the traveller walks,\r\nconstantly in danger of breaking through, not indeed into a fathomless\r\nabyss, but into boiling hot, bitter water, in which we would counsel no\r\none to take a foot-bath. If the crust be broken off, there are seen\r\nshining beneath the most exquisite lustrous crystals of sulphur. This\r\nsulphur, which is exhibited here piled up in immense masses like small\r\nhills, is the same as that which occasionally entices the Javanese into\r\nthese appalling abysses. The most powerful solfatara, which lies exactly\r\nin the middle ridge, and like a geyser throws up to a height apparently of\r\none or two feet a column of boiling water, consisting in part of sulphur,\r\nis for that reason unapproachable by man.\r\n\r\n\"From the Poison Crater we climbed over into the King's Crater. The hard\r\nmasses of rubbish thrown out during the last eruption afforded firm\r\nfooting here, until we got near the sputtering solfataras, when the hot\r\nyielding mud made further progress impracticable.\r\n\r\n\"The visit to these two craters, which change features from year to year,\r\nfurnished much material for observation. It was long past noon when we\r\nretraced our steps upwards along the precipitous path by which we had\r\ndescended. Ere long we found ourselves once more on the summit, protected\r\nfrom the sun's vertical rays by the grateful shelter of the hut which\r\nJunghuhn had erected here, and from which we could take in at one glance,\r\nin all its vast proportions, the entire abyss, with its two smoking\r\ncraters in all their horrid sublimity. The oval of the exterior rim\r\nmeasures not less than 6000 feet in length by 3000 in breadth, and from\r\nthe upper wall the descent sheer into the abyss is not less than 800 feet\r\nperpendicular.\r\n\r\n\"This was the last crater which we had an opportunity of visiting while\r\nin Java--our further peregrinations being directed towards the schistose\r\nformation abounding in petrifactions, which is found in the S.W. mountain\r\nrange of the table-land of Bandong.\r\n\r\n\"On the evening of the 18th, after we had returned from Tangkuban Prahu,\r\nwe left Lembang, still in the company of Dr. de Vrij, who sacrificed his\r\nown convenience to accompany us throughout our interesting tour, and\r\nreturned to Bandong.\r\n\r\n\"Junghuhn had sketched out a second _carte de voyage_, which he had sent\r\nto the Resident of Bandong, with a request that this gentleman would make\r\nall necessary preparations to enable the projected excursion to be made in\r\nthe shortest possible time, and for our comfort while on the road. We thus\r\nfound everything prepared beforehand, and, after passing a most agreeable\r\nevening with the Resident and the Regent of Bandong, the latter of whom\r\ncaused his dancing-girls to execute in our presence some of their most\r\ncharacteristic national dances, we were enabled to start early the\r\nfollowing morning to prosecute our journey further among the mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Gratitude to M. Visscher, the Assistant Resident, and to Raden Adipata\r\nWira Nata Kusuma, the Regent of Bandong,[62] makes it an imperative duty\r\nthat we should make the most ample acknowledgment for the great pains\r\ntaken by both those gentlemen to enable us, without losing time consulting\r\nabout other cares, to devote our entire attention to scientific\r\nexamination. Indeed, the whole arrangements of this trip may be held to\r\nindicate what the Dutch Government is able to attain by the astute policy\r\nof leaving the executive power entirely in the hands of the native chiefs,\r\nand with what admirable exactness the despotic orders of these two united\r\npowers are carried into execution.\r\n\r\n\"The brother of the Regent of Bandong, a truly chivalrous soul, but\r\nimperious and full of aristocratic hauteur in his deportment towards the\r\npeasantry, was our companion and guard of honour. All our material\r\nrequirements had been cared for by the Regent in the most luxurious\r\nprofusion. Four servants and a special cook, together with a number of\r\ncoolies, were sent in advance to our next designated resting-place,\r\nsometimes in the heart of a forest, or upon a hill, or in a narrow defile,\r\nso that on our arrival we found our table already set for us. On these\r\noccasions, when there was no Pasanggrahan or comfortable hut at hand for\r\nour mid-day siesta, or for our accommodation at night, we found an elegant\r\nhut of bamboo and palm-leaves (of which materials the Javanese construct\r\na thousand articles of every-day use) newly erected, and containing\r\ndining-room, sleeping-apartment, and bath-room. In order to travel with as\r\nmuch celerity as possible, our riding horses were changed three or four\r\ntimes a day. The fresh animals were everywhere ready for us to mount. At\r\nthose points where petrifactions were likely to be found collected\r\ntogether natives would be sent forward, and that not by twos and threes,\r\nbut by dozens and twenties, who were charged to dig and collect together\r\nwhatever was found, so that all we had to do was to select what we\r\nrequired, when we found we had a splendid collection without trouble or\r\nloss of time. Even on roads seldom frequented, in outlying districts among\r\nthe mountains, we found everything arranged anew, and we do not exaggerate\r\nwhen we say that between forty and fifty small bridges and narrow stiles\r\nmade of bamboo and with bamboo balustrades must have been constructed\r\nsolely to make this path passable. But still more particularly we had\r\noccasion to remark, that when it was necessary to descend into the\r\ndefiles, which would naturally be of special interest to a geologist on\r\naccount of their explanations of the phenomena of nature, fresh paths had\r\nbeen made, and all obstacles presented by the rocky soil overcome by means\r\nof steps cut in the rock or bamboo ladders! And all this had been planned\r\nand executed after the Regent had been informed of the day fixed for our\r\ndeparture from Bandong on our projected tour.\r\n\r\n\"No fewer than thirty-eight mounted Sundanese, all gaily dressed in their\r\nnational costume, being in fact the chiefs and magistrates of the\r\ndistrict, had attached themselves to us with all their retinue, besides a\r\nnumber of porters to attend upon the cavalcade, by all of whom we were\r\ncordially welcomed. Towards evening we entered amid music and dancing into\r\nthe village, which it had been arranged was to be our quarters for the\r\nnight, and amid more music, and a general gathering of the population, we\r\nonce more, in the grey dawn of the next morning, mounted our horses. Such\r\nis the mode of travel in Java when a Junghuhn prescribes the route, when a\r\nDutch Government official issues the requisite orders, and when a native\r\nRegent carries them out.\r\n\r\n\"On the 19th May we set off in an easterly direction from Bandong for the\r\nriver Tji-Tarum. Our object was to explore the beautiful natural defile\r\nwhich is presented by the deep chasm which forms the bed of that stream,\r\nwhere it has forced a passage in a northerly direction through a\r\nround-backed range of green-stone and porphyritic mountains which spring\r\nfrom the table-land of Bandong, forming in this part of its course the\r\nbeautiful water-falls of Tjuruk-Kapek, Tjuruk-Lanong, and Tjuruk-Djombong.\r\nIn close proximity to the very oldest volcanic formations of Java, one\r\nsees here, laid bare by the river, lofty walls of the latest fresh-water\r\nstrata of the plateau of Bandong. We now rode through the porphyritic\r\nridge to the rocky cone of Batu-Susun, on the flank of the Gunung Bulut,\r\nformed of vast columns of a sort of porphyritic green-stone, and the same\r\nevening reached Tjililui, the chief town of the district named Rongga,\r\nowing to its richness in petrifactions. Not greater was our surprise at\r\nour exceedingly hospitable reception, than at beholding, as we sat down to\r\nour evening meal in the Pasanggrahan where we were stopping, a huge table\r\ndrawn forth, loaded with petrifactions and geological specimens, which the\r\nWedanah had collected, and which, classified according to a chart of the\r\ndistrict which he had himself prepared, he now placed at our disposal. The\r\nname of this spirited Sundanese is Mas Djaja Bradja, Wedanah of Tjililui.\r\n\r\n\"On the 20th we inspected the spot itself where these are found. By\r\ndaybreak we were _en route_ for the chalk-kilns of Liotji Tjangkang, where\r\na coral bank, abounding in petrifactions, lies full in view from the\r\nsummit of an adjoining eminence. Hence we directed our steps in a S.E.\r\ndirection, getting deeper into the mountains, in the neighbourhood of\r\nGonnong Gatu, renowned for the numbers of tigers which range the immense\r\nwilderness of _allang_ grass (_Imperata Allang_), which now forms the\r\ncovering of these mountains, utterly denuded as they are of their original\r\nvegetation, and in which they find plenty of prey among the stags, wild\r\nboars, and buffaloes. Hunting however was not our object, but the\r\nsuccession of chasms, 100 feet deep, worn through the soft pumice and\r\ntrachytic tufas by the action of the Tji-Lanang and its little tributary\r\nstreams. First we had to scramble down to the confluence of the Tji-Burial\r\nand the Tji-Tangkil, where, in close proximity to the dykes of trachyte,\r\nseveral well-preserved _conchylia_ were found amid the rubbish that had\r\nbeen detached from the sides of this cavity, which are composed of a sort\r\nof muddy tufa. After riding at full speed through a thinly-inhabited\r\nmountain district, in order to avoid an impending thunder-storm, we\r\nluckily reached the little mountain village of Gunung-Alu, lying on the\r\nTji-Dadass, at the foot of a mountain ridge, which forms the water-shed\r\nbetween the northern and southern coasts of Java.\r\n\r\n\"On 21st May we set off for the valley of the Tji-Lanang, which stretches\r\nbeneath the steep sandstone acclivities of the Gunung Sela, another spot\r\nwhere petrifactions are exceedingly abundant, and where the remains of the\r\nfossils may be observed in the position they originally occupied, imbedded\r\nin the strata of mud and sandstone. A species of fossil resin is also\r\nfrequently found there, in juxtaposition with other beautiful fossils.\r\nFrom this point we followed the valley of the Tji-Lanang in a northerly\r\ndirection, and on quitting it we came upon a little traversed road leading\r\nto the valley of the Tji-Tjamotha, at the calcareous-brecciose rocks of\r\nBatu-Kakapa, and still further on reached the mountainous village of\r\nTji-Jabang, whence we descended once more to the river Tji-Tarum, which at\r\nthis point passes through a narrow cleft in the rock, more than a thousand\r\nfeet deep, forming thus the grandest waterfall in Java, as it breaks\r\nthrough the western barrier range of the plateau of Bandong, consisting\r\nof porphyritic green-stone, trachytic-basalt, and perpendicular cliffs of\r\nchalk. Below this, after a series of splendid cascades, it becomes a\r\nnavigable stream, flowing gently over the terrace of Radjamandala.\r\n\r\n\"The majestic scale of the natural scenery of Java is seen fully developed\r\nin these savage, awful rocky defiles, shaded by primeval forest, and\r\nhaunted by every description of wild animal. There are three points of\r\nspecial interest, Tjukang-Raon, Tjuruk-Almion, and Sangjang-Holut, at any\r\nof which one may study in the very bowels of the earth the geognostical\r\nstructure of the Lanang chain, where the river has burst through. These\r\npoints lie quite near to each other on the edge of the stream which here\r\nfrets in its channel, hemmed closely by the rocks, but in order to reach\r\nany one of them it is always necessary to retrace one's steps to the\r\nvillage of Tji-jabang, on the plateau of the mountain, and thence scramble\r\ndown and up again the precipitous rocky wall in height from 1000 to 1600\r\nfeet! One can readily believe what Junghuhn writes in 1854, that 'although\r\nTjurak-Almion' (dust or vapour fall) 'is the grandest waterfall in Java,\r\nno European had, as yet, visited the spot but himself.' It was here\r\nespecially that we had occasion to notice what pains the natives had taken\r\nto render the various localities more accessible. We found fresh-hewn\r\nsteps, ladders, and Rotang ropes, and thus we were enabled, so to speak,\r\nto tread in the footsteps of Junghuhn.\r\n\r\n\"On the 21st we could only visit the Tjuruk-Baon, where the Tji-Tarum,\r\nraging along in its entire volume, is compelled to pass through a gate of\r\nrock not above 12 feet wide. A frail-looking bamboo ladder, with Rotang\r\nropes suspended on either side at a dizzy elevation above, leads down the\r\nperpendicular walls of this stone portal.\r\n\r\n\"On the morning of the 22nd we visited Tjuruk-Almion, the finest waterfall\r\nof the Tji-Tarum, which is here precipitated over a precipice of\r\ngreen-stone forty feet in height, and thence, after passing the steep\r\nbasaltic chain of Gunung-Lanang, we descended from a height of 2653 Paris\r\nfeet, into the deepest part (990 Paris feet above sea-level) of the chasm\r\nformed by volcanic eruption in the mountain Sangjang-Holut, where close to\r\nthe steep broken rim, and in juxtaposition to the tertiary formations on\r\nthe level of Radjamandala, the perpendicular sandstone banks of the river\r\nleave a passage only 10 feet in width.\r\n\r\n\"The same day we reached the little village of Gua, at the foot of the\r\nnorthern side of Gunung Nungnang, an enormous mass of limestone, whose\r\nsteep sides form a portion of the extensive limestone barrier, which\r\nbounds the table-land of Radjamandala to the southward. Gunung Nungnang is\r\ntraversed by fissures and clefts from top to bottom, in which the Salangan\r\nswallow builds edible nests, which the natives gather for the Regent, not\r\nwithout peril to life.\r\n\r\n\"On the 23rd May we carefully explored Sangjang Tji-Koro, a\r\nlimestone-hill, through which one arm of the Tji-Tarum, after it has\r\nburst through the barrier-ridge, flows in a subterranean channel;\r\ninteresting in a geological point of view, because at this point we find\r\nthe very same limestone rocks which in an upright position form the\r\nstructure of the hill, lying horizontally on the flat plain of\r\nRadjamandala, on the opposite bank of this brook. At Radjamandala we once\r\nmore struck the main road, and found our travelling chaise ready, which\r\nconveyed us to Tjiandjur, and thence back to Batavia.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the geologist of our Expedition was occupied in the excursion above\r\ndescribed, the commodore and his companions witnessed a most interesting\r\nspectacle in an ethnographical point of view. The Javanese Regent of\r\nTjiandjur prepared a great fete, to which all the populace were invited,\r\nin the great hall of the palace, where a variety of entertainments, games,\r\nand dramatic representations took place. Here, as at Bandong, the interior\r\nof the house was entirely furnished in the European fashion, and only the\r\near-splitting, deafening tones of the gamelong,[63] the stout, bustling\r\nfemale house-keeper, who, richly apparelled and wearing yellow\r\nunmentionables, did the honours with a somewhat waddling gait, and the\r\nOriental dress of the Regent, behind whom a couple of Javanese servants,\r\ncrouched on their hams, carrying a neatly-carved silver box of exquisite\r\nworkmanship, containing the ingredients for the betel, recalled to our\r\nrecollection that we were in Java, in the residence of a native prince.\r\nThe stiff, troublesome formalities of the Dutch were outdone by those of\r\nthe Javanese: nay, so great is the observance of etiquette by these\r\npeople, that even the nearest relatives of the house are fain to take up\r\ntheir place in the verandah or colonnade which runs round the house, but\r\ndo not dare venture into the saloon itself. In this latter, besides the\r\nRegent and his consort, there were only the European guests invited, while\r\nthe people thronged the doors and windows as spectators of what was going\r\non. The fete began with some very monotonous, infinitely tedious dances\r\nexecuted by the _Bayaderes_. In the choreographic art, despite the\r\nimportant part which dancing plays in their religious worship, the\r\nJavanese, like all the other populations of Asia, lag far behind the\r\nnatives of the north. True, the dance with them has a widely different\r\nmeaning, compared with that which we attach to it, who waltz and polka\r\naway in joyous, frolicsome mood, whereas the Asiatics, the Malay and the\r\nHindoo, also dance during seasons of grief and anguish; with them dancing\r\nis nothing but a mode of expressing their feelings, whether these be grave\r\nor gay, joyous or sad. And so deeply is this custom implanted among the\r\ncoloured races, that we have ourselves seen in Costa Rica Indian parents,\r\nwho had been converted to Christianity, dancing before the dead body of\r\ntheir child, which was about being committed to consecrated earth.[64]\r\n\r\nThe figures of the dance performed by the Javanese dancing-girls were\r\nnothing but a series of very slow rigid movements of advance and retreat,\r\nin the course of which they went through all sorts of attitudes and\r\ncontortions with their hands and fingers. We were informed that these\r\ndancers were representing four sisters who were searching for their lost\r\nmother, and by their various postures and figuring hoped to obtain her\r\nagain from the deity. This exhibition was succeeded by a war-dance,\r\nperformed by eight maidens clothed as warriors, which however scarcely\r\ndiffered from the former, and was not less tedious. These dancers all\r\nappeared in extremely elegant richly-appointed dresses, which\r\nunfortunately only made the ugliness of their features more disagreeably\r\nconspicuous. Amid all these representations the deep boom of the gamelong\r\nalmost unceasingly resounded in our ears, being struck, evidently for the\r\npurpose of stunning the senses, by a crowd of Javanese cowering on the\r\nground with their feet crossed beneath them, while from without there fell\r\non our ear the tunes of a brass band, especially noticeable by its\r\noverpowering penetrating sound. About 10 P.M. a number of rockets and\r\nfire-wheels were let off, and a disorderly crowd of maskers, on horse and\r\nfoot, to the great delight of the assembled populace, made their\r\nappearance and marched about a dozen times round the great room. The chief\r\nhonours of the entire procession were reserved for a transparent serpent,\r\nat least 20 feet long, which was borne along in the air by six or eight\r\nyouths, who imitated with surprising address the wriggling motions of that\r\nlithe reptile.\r\n\r\nTo a European observer, however, what was going on in one corner of the\r\ngreat room seemed far more extraordinary and surprising. A number of\r\nnative fanatics were standing here round a heap of red-hot coals and\r\nashes, before which a Mahometan priest, holding in his hand a small open\r\nbook, was murmuring a prayer, accompanied by doleful cries and\r\nunintelligible groans. Several natives sprang barefooted into the fire,\r\nand turned about several times in its midst. The priest also, singing and\r\npraying the while, skipped upon the red-hot floor, apparently with the\r\nintention of inciting the by-standers to yet further exertions. The whole\r\nexhibition bore the character of being a form of religious expiation,\r\nalthough it was carried on amid all the noise and fun of a popular\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\nA still more painful impression was made by several Javanese, who placed\r\niron circlets set with fine sharp points on the cheeks, forehead, and\r\neyes, and thus accoutred, twisted their bodies about in every conceivable\r\ndirection, as though they were striving all they could to drill deep into\r\ntheir flesh with this heavy iron instrument. The leading idea contemplated\r\nin this rude fearsome exhibition, seems, however, to have been simply to\r\namuse a circle of curious spectators, and gain their applause.\r\n\r\nThe Javanese Regent, Radhen Adhipati Aria Kusuma Ningrat, who gave this\r\nfete, a tall, robust man, of about fifty years of age, is held in high\r\nesteem by the inhabitants of his district, not alone for his political\r\nworth, but also for his intellectual qualities. He is an author and a\r\npoet, and availed himself of the opportunity to present to the foreign\r\nguests his last poem, an epic.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 17th the entire company of travellers set out\r\nfrom Tjiandjur on their return to Batavia by the Java road, by which they\r\nhad come. The naturalists, too, did not leave the capital of the Preanger\r\nResidency without substantial tokens of amity, since a medical gentleman\r\nsettled there, Dr. I. Ch. Ploem, presented them with a number of\r\ninteresting specimens, botanical and zoological, and not alone enriched\r\ntheir collections in natural history with many new objects, but also\r\npromised in future to maintain an active interchange of objects of\r\nscientific interest with the museum of the Empire-city on the Danube.\r\n\r\nThe journey back to Buitenzorg, despite a tremendous thunder-storm,\r\naccompanied by such a shower as is only encountered in the tropics, was\r\nnevertheless pretty quickly got over, and even one trifling adventure\r\nwhich was encountered on the way--in the course of which one of the\r\ntravelling carriages fell into a ditch on one side of the road, near\r\nMegamendung, in consequence of which the coachman and attendants were\r\nsomewhat injured by their sudden precipitation from the box--had no more\r\nserious ulterior consequences than that we had to get out of the carriage\r\nfor a short space under a deluge of rain, so as to admit of its being more\r\nreadily put into running order again. Despite the inclemency of the\r\nweather we were on this occasion accompanied on horseback by the\r\nmagistrates of the villages through which we passed, and although many of\r\nthese were shivering and chattering with the wet and cold, they were\r\nnevertheless inexorable in assisting to send us forward, and though not\r\nrequired to do so, accompanied us to our next station, where their place\r\nwas supplied by others not less attentive.\r\n\r\nWhile still on the road, the commodore and several members of the\r\nExpedition received an invitation from the Governor-general to stop at his\r\nsummer residence of Buitenzorg, and to make it for some days their\r\nresting-place. It was unfortunate, that this display of hospitality was\r\nsomewhat weakened in cordiality by a too rigid observance of those minor\r\nmatters of etiquette, which his Excellency seemed to think he could not\r\nafford to dispense with even in his quiet, unostentatious country-seat.\r\nThe stringent observance of such unbending measured ceremony is the more\r\nremarkable, in the case of a man who has raised himself from an obscure\r\ngrade of citizenship to this lofty post, and who does not even indulge in\r\nthat lavish expense or profuse luxury, which would at least be in harmony\r\nwith the ceremonial usages with which he surrounds himself. M. Van Pahud\r\ncame to Batavia about twenty years before, as a school-master, and ere\r\nlong, having become an employe in the civil service, secured through his\r\nadministrative capacity, and restless activity, the confidence and\r\nsympathies of the Government, was somewhat later appointed Colonial\r\nMinister in Holland, and finally, in 1856, Governor-general of the Dutch\r\nEast Indies. The introduction of the _quinquina_ plant from Peru and its\r\npresent extension throughout Java, are his chief claims to recognition.\r\n\r\nAs M. Van Pahud is a widower, the honours of his mansion were performed by\r\nhis daughter, a lady in delicate health, who a few years previously had\r\nthe distressing trial of beholding her husband, who filled one of the most\r\nimportant posts as Resident at a Regency in the interior, cut down before\r\nher eyes by a Malay!\r\n\r\nWe spent a couple of days in this charming retreat of Buitenzorg, whose\r\nbotanical garden ever unfolded fresh beauties, and had the pleasure on\r\nthis, as on the occasion of our first visit, to make several most\r\nagreeable acquaintances. A deep interest attaches to our visit to Madame\r\nHartmann, the widow of a former Resident in Borneo, who possesses a small\r\nbut every way remarkable collection of ethnographic objects illustrative\r\nof that island, and who not alone had the thoughtful courtesy to show us\r\nall these treasures of natural history, but even presented us with a\r\nconsiderable portion of them. The writer of this account felt himself in\r\nan especial degree under obligation to this excellent lady for a number of\r\nskeletons of the various races of men inhabiting that island, which it\r\nwould have been exceedingly difficult to procure otherwise. There existed\r\nbut one object in this anthropological collection with which Madame\r\nHartmann would not part: this was the skull of a Chinaman, who, during the\r\nfearful insurrection of these emigrants in Borneo in 1819, made a\r\nmurderous onslaught on her husband, whose servants fortunately succeeded\r\nin rendering timely aid by cutting the miscreant down.\r\n\r\nEarly on 20th May we quitted Buitenzorg. On the same morning two criminals\r\naccused of murder and robbery were brought thither. Although the\r\npunishment of death is only inflicted in cases of extreme atrocity, yet we\r\nwere informed that in the capital scarcely a month passes without the\r\ninfliction of this last penalty.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Batavia we once more found ourselves the objects of that\r\ncharming hospitality, to which we are indebted for the memory of many most\r\nagreeable hours.\r\n\r\nThere was one gentleman in particular, a German countryman, Colonel Von\r\nSchierbrand, who has lived nearly thirty years in Java, and at present\r\nholds the high position of head of the Engineer department and President\r\nof the Topographical Institute, who most hospitably entertained the\r\nvoyagers of the _Novara_ in his elegant, comfortable dwelling, and\r\narranged a variety of amusements and agreeable receptions.[65] Among\r\nthese, the gentlemen who took part in it will long have a special\r\nrecollection of a hunting party, which, owing to the great interest taken\r\nby all classes of the community near the seat of action, abounding in\r\nantelopes and wild hogs, became ultimately a regular ovation and popular\r\nfestival. At various points arches covered with leaves were erected, flags\r\nfluttered to the breeze on every side, and all along our path the\r\ninhabitants, gaily attired, formed a dense array lining the road; while\r\nthe evening was whiled away in the elegantly furnished mansion of a\r\nChinese, the Mayor of his district, by Javanese dancing-girls, who\r\nperformed a variety of national dances to the monotonous, lugubrious sound\r\nof the gamelong and other musical instruments, after which there was a\r\ncomedy, the whole winding up with Chinese fire-works on the grandest\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nAnother splendid entertainment was got up in honour of the _Novara_\r\nExpedition by the military \"Concordia\" society, in their large, handsome\r\nassembly-room in Weltevreden. The dancing-hall was tastefully fitted up,\r\nadorned with blue and green hangings and parti-coloured flags, while over\r\nthe entrance was suspended a portrait of our Emperor. In the background of\r\nthe saloon there was set up in front of a transparency an elegant boat,\r\nwith an Austrian flag at the gaff, and carrying a cannon crowned with\r\nflowers and nautical emblems, all artistically designed and executed. The\r\nstewards all wore red and white ribbons round their dress, while the rich\r\nattire of the ladies consisted principally of stuffs in the Austrian\r\ncolours. When the commander of the Expedition entered the saloon with his\r\nstaff, the band struck up the Austrian National Hymn. The whole festivity\r\nwent off most agreeably, and the majority of the company, which numbered\r\nabout 800 guests, kept it up till daybreak. Both Dutch and Austrian\r\nofficers vied with each other in making this a truly fraternal feast.\r\nStill as the band played on, there seemed no end to the fun and frolic,\r\nand one pair of joyous spirits suddenly bethought them of the droll idea\r\nof hauling the cannon \"with all its honours thick upon it\" through the\r\napartment, with a not less frolicsome comrade sitting astride it, singing\r\nand shouting! Unluckily, during this peregrination one of the Dutch\r\nofficers fell under the wheel, and had his thigh broken near the knee. The\r\nunfortunate had to be conveyed to the hospital forthwith, where for weeks\r\nhe could ruminate upon the consequences of a moment's misplaced revelry.\r\nThis gentleman, singularly enough, had just retired home and gone to bed,\r\nwhen a couple of his comrades insisted on his accompanying them, amid much\r\ncheering and noise, back to the apartment, where the accident happened to\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nOne remarkable character in Batavia, whose acquaintance we only made\r\nduring the latter days of our stay, is Raden Saleh, a Javanese of high\r\nbirth, and princely descent, who, born in 1816 at Djokjokarta in the\r\ninterior of the island, was at the expense of the Dutch Government brought\r\nto Europe when a boy of 14, where he lived for a long time at the Hague,\r\nand afterwards in Dresden and Paris, turning his attention chiefly to\r\npainting, and who, after 23 years' absence, had returned to Java shortly\r\nbefore our arrival. Raden Saleh, who speaks and writes several European\r\nlanguages with fluency, draws a not inconsiderable sum yearly from the\r\nColonial Government, by way of remuneration for pictures which he is from\r\ntime to time commissioned to paint for Government House. At the period of\r\nour visit the artist was busy engaged in executing for the King of Holland\r\na large oil-painting, representing a stag-hunt on the plain of Mundschul,\r\nin the Preanger Regency, at the foot of the Malabar range. The\r\ncomposition, the landscape, the aerial perspective, the attitudes and\r\ngrouping of the mounted huntsmen, gave evidence of uncommon talent, which\r\nunfortunately, however, has not been cultivated to that extent as to\r\nenable him to stamp all his performances with the impress of artistic\r\nperfection. Raden Saleh cherishes a warm feeling for Germany, which even\r\nhis placid, delightful residence among the Eden-like landscapes of his own\r\nnative land has not been able to weaken. \"I owe so much to Germany,\" he\r\nwould say to us; \"my thoughts and my feelings ever revert to Germany!\" It\r\nseemed that in his case, as in that of the young negro prince, Aquasie\r\nBoachi, of the Gold Coast, considerations of health were the main reason\r\nfor his return to the Dutch East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe last days of our stay at Batavia we devoted to an inspection of\r\nvarious public institutions. First of all we carefully examined the\r\nbarracks, which present several points of special interest. Major Smits\r\nwas so kind as to accompany us over the extensive grounds, in which were\r\nat the time some 800 men. The soldiers are all volunteers, and consist of\r\nabout 250 whites, and 600 of the various coloured races of the Malay\r\nArchipelago. The white troops sleep in beds, the coloured upon wooden\r\nsettles covered with mosquito-nets. Each soldier is allowed to have his\r\nwife beside him, and it is affirmed that this extraordinary practice tends\r\nto make them more orderly and regular, by accustoming them more speedily\r\nto life in the barrack, which thus becomes for them a sort of small town!\r\nThe women for their part prove highly serviceable as cooks, washerwomen,\r\nvendors of edibles, &c., and manage a sort of small market for each\r\ncompany, where the soldier can find everything he may require for\r\nsatisfying his usually very moderate wants.\r\n\r\nMajor Smits ordered a number of the soldiers, representatives of the most\r\nimportant Malay types, to be submitted to a series of anthropometrical\r\nmeasurements, and made a present to the Expedition of a number of objects\r\nof ethnographical interest.\r\n\r\nIn company with Dr. Steenstra Toussaint, an ardent and amiable companion,\r\nwe visited the various prisons, and the Loar-Badang,[66] of evil repute,\r\nwhich will be discussed in the medical section of the _Novara_\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nThe prisons of Batavia stand in much need of reform, especially as regards\r\nconstruction, management, and treatment. The humane sentiments that\r\ncharacterize our century, have more care even for a robber or murderer\r\nthan to load him with chains, and make him still more dangerous to\r\nsociety, by lengthened confinement within the thick lofty walls of a\r\nprison. There are two categories, into which all criminals in Java are\r\ndivided, those who during the entire term of their sentence are to remain\r\nwithin the prison, and those who during the day are employed outside the\r\nprison on the public works, most of whom wear an iron ring round their\r\nneck, or chains on their hands or feet, whence they are usually termed\r\n\"chain-gang\" prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the city Bridewell, where the criminals serve their sentences in cells,\r\nthere is room for 200, and at the time of our visit there were 70 male and\r\ntwo female prisoners in confinement. The disagreeable impression made at\r\nfinding such an establishment located in an exceedingly unhealthy site, is\r\nanything but diminished when the visitor perceives that it consists mainly\r\nof a large number of narrow corridors and high walls running parallel\r\nwith each other at short distances, between which the prisoners, in\r\ndivisions of from six to ten, are confined in small cells, two\r\noccasionally inhabiting the same cell. Those condemned to imprisonment for\r\ndebt are shut up in a special compartment, apart from the common run of\r\ncriminals, but in respect of accommodation and general treatment are in no\r\nrespect better off than the latter. The law permits the incarceration of a\r\ndebtor for three years, but the creditor is compelled to pay 10 guilders a\r\nmonth (L10 per annum), to defray the cost of his maintenance. It is\r\nillustrative of the Chinese character, and its speculative propensities,\r\nthat hardly any of that nation are to be found on the criminal side,\r\nwhereas they furnish the longest quota of those imprisoned for debt. We\r\nsaw one Javanese woman, who of her own free will submitted to be\r\nimprisoned with her husband who had been condemned to several years'\r\nincarceration, although she could only communicate with him in the\r\npresence of witnesses, and had to live in an entirely different part of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nIn the prison where the \"chain-gangers\" were confined, there were 170\r\nprisoners.[67] Owing to the circumstance that those committed in Batavia\r\nare draughted off to the prisons in the interior, while those sentenced in\r\nthe provinces are sent to fulfil their sentences in the prisons of\r\nBatavia, the stranger encounters in these latter numerous peculiar types\r\nof natives from the various districts of Java and the adjoining islands,\r\nand this rare opportunity was made use of by myself and Dr. Schwarz to\r\nobtain some corporeal measurements of individuals presenting the\r\ncharacteristics of their respective races, as had already been done in the\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nDr. Toussaint presented the Expedition with several pathological\r\npreparations, as also with one curiosity rather of historical than\r\nscientific interest, namely, the skull of a man, found a few years before\r\nin the maw of a shark which had been picked up dead at sea!\r\n\r\nA very singular impression was left on us by a visit we paid to \"Meester\r\nCornelis,\" a sort of bazaar in the outskirts of Batavia, where a singular\r\nphase of life may be seen nightly in full activity. On a wide open square\r\nare a large number of booths, in which are sold all sorts of eatables and\r\ndrinkables, while there is at the same time no lack of dancing-girls,\r\nJavanese musicians, opium-dens, gambling \"hells,\" and other\r\nbreeding-places of human depravity. The majority of its frequenters are\r\nChinese, who spend here in the most extravagant manner what they have\r\nearned during the day. They especially affect the filthy little closets,\r\nwhere for a couple of doits (a halfpenny English) they can lie stretched\r\nout in a pitiable state of stupefaction, the result of opium-smoking, but\r\nare likewise by no means backward in patronizing the gambling booths. A\r\ngroup of these half-naked children of the Celestial Empire, seated in a\r\ncircle on the ground amid the flare of torches and lamps, each holding in\r\nhis lean hand a pair of greasy, well-worn cards, and with a little heap of\r\ncopper or silver pieces spread out before him, following the chances of\r\nthe game with a wild eagerness that makes him utterly heedless of what is\r\npassing around him, presents a spectacle of such powerful interest, that\r\nthe beholder, especially if a foreigner, likes to remain amid a scene so\r\npeculiar, despite its repulsiveness. The most melancholy consideration\r\nperhaps of all is that this form of dissipation seems by no means\r\nindigenous to Java, but was first introduced with many other forms of vice\r\nunder the influence of foreign civilization.\r\n\r\nFor the observant traveller, a visit to such so-called \"places of\r\namusement\" possesses a far deeper interest than theatres or operas, which\r\none may see and hear among the various settlements in this Archipelago.\r\nSuch wandering companies, even those which are as highly remunerated as\r\nthe \"troupes\" who minister to the aesthetic tastes of the wealthy\r\ninhabitants of the countries beyond sea,[68] or rather to an indispensable\r\nfashion, must awaken among European visitors melancholy reminiscences of\r\nvanished triumphs of art. Thus Batavia, during our stay, could boast a\r\nFrench operatic company. The theatre, lofty and airy, though of but one\r\nstorey, without either boxes or gallery, had far more the appearance of a\r\nconcert-room than a regular theatre. The rather heavy cost was defrayed by\r\nlotteries, which were set on foot by the Colonial Government from time to\r\ntime for the behoof of the funds of the theatre. Several of the\r\n\"cantatrices\" carry on simultaneously with their engagements a lucrative\r\nbusiness in French articles for the toilette, while the men-singers give\r\ninstruction in vocalization, by which they not merely eke out their\r\nliving, but contribute handsomely to the annoyance of their next-door\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nThere is but little sociability in Batavia. The people live in a\r\nthoroughly retired manner, each usually receiving only a small circle of\r\nfriends in his own house. On this point, as on many others, our _own_\r\nexperience is _directly contrary_ to the actual state of matters, seeing\r\nthat during our entire stay one invitation followed on the heels of\r\nanother;--but those who live here for years together, even under the most\r\nfavourable auspices, have repeatedly assured us that life in Batavia is\r\nunsociable and tedious.\r\n\r\nThis is the misfortune of all countries \"beyond sea,\" where Europeans do\r\nnot settle permanently, but flock thither with the intention, after a\r\ncertain number of years of industry and activity, of returning home with a\r\nfortune made by their own personal exertions. We see this in Brazil, in\r\nthe West Indies, in the Western coast of South America; in a word, in all\r\ntropical or sub-tropical countries where, on account of climatic\r\nconsiderations, the greater part of the European population is changed\r\nevery ten years, and is recruited by fresh arrivals from Europe. How out\r\nof place, accordingly, does social or intellectual life appear in such\r\ncountries, as compared with the colonies settled in temperate climates, in\r\nNorth America, at the Cape, in Australia, in New Zealand, in all of which\r\nthe immigrant population is of a fixed character, building up for\r\nthemselves a second home, and clinging with love and gratitude to the soil\r\nthat gives them sustenance, and on which their sons will grow up, under\r\nthe invigorating influences of free institutions, into free, prosperous,\r\nself-relying men!\r\n\r\nEven in Batavia the majority of the European residents change every eight\r\nor ten years; instances such as that of Colonel von Schierbrand, of men\r\nwho during 30 years have never once left the island, never yet seen a\r\nrailroad, being of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous friends whom we were so fortunate as to make during our\r\nstay in Java, and to whom such heart-felt thanks are due for their\r\nhospitality and the warm interest they took in the objects of our\r\nExpedition,[69] many have since left the island for ever, and by their\r\nreturn to Europe left many a lamentable vacancy.[70] The more deserving\r\nof acknowledgment is the constant endeavour of the present Colonial\r\nGovernment to attract to itself fresh intelligence, and so not alone\r\nstimulate the scientific activity of the present, but also provide for the\r\nfilling up of the various posts by properly qualified persons. The\r\nmagnificent and expensive works which have been published of late years in\r\nJava by men of science, are the splendid fruit of that noble-minded\r\nsupport, and it is much to be regretted that the Government does not\r\nextend this liberality to their _political_ system,--that despite the\r\nglorious example in their own immediate neighbourhood of the results of\r\nEnglish Free Trade, Government still cramps the energies of the colony\r\nwith monopolies and privileges, and thereby checks the development of a\r\ncountry, which, alike by its position and its manifold natural advantages,\r\nbids fair to be one of the wealthiest and most prosperous countries in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAt seven A.M. on the 29th May, the _Novara_ weighed anchor in the roads of\r\nBatavia, after a stay of 23 days. Our next visit was to be paid to the\r\nPhilippine Archipelago,--to the flourishing island of Luzon, or rather to\r\nManila, the most important settlement in the entire group. This was the\r\npleasantest trip throughout the whole voyage. The distance, some 1800\r\nnautical miles, was achieved in 17 days, with delightful weather, and\r\nbalmy south-west monsoons.[71] By the 14th June we were in sight of the\r\ncoast of Luzon, and on the following day we ran on before the freshening\r\nmonsoon into the broad, beautiful gulf of Manila. As we passed between the\r\nrock La Monja (the Nun) and \"El Corregidor,\" or Governor's Island, which\r\nlie right in the channel, we met the _Cleopatra_, a large English\r\nscrew-steamer, which had a freight of 1150 Chinese, who were to be\r\nimported into the Havanna as so-called \"free\" labourers. These poor\r\nwretches came from Amoy, and, as we afterwards learned, had been put on\r\nboard so scantily provided, and so little cared for by the authorities,\r\nthat thus early, during the voyage from Amoy to Manila, only 700 miles,\r\neleven of these \"passengers\" had died, and the captain found himself\r\ncompelled to bear up for the nearest harbour in consequence of a sort of\r\nmalignant fever having broken out on board, so virulent that there were\r\ndeaths occurring almost every day. We shall treat more particularly of\r\nthis hideous trade in men, which is chiefly carried on by the Portuguese,\r\nwhen describing our visit to Macao.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Manila is a beautiful land-locked basin, of such splendid\r\nproportions that when we had passed Governor's Island the city of Manila\r\nwas still below the horizon. We anchored on the afternoon of 18th June in\r\nthe harbour of Cavite (seven nautical miles south of Manila), because\r\nduring the S.W. monsoon this harbour is more sheltered, and therefore\r\nsafer for ships, than the shallow open roadstead of the capital. Cavite,\r\nwhich boasts a fort, an arsenal, a dockyard, and a cigar manufactory, lies\r\non a low, narrow tongue of land projecting into the bay. Whoever may have\r\nfirst set foot at Cavite, on the soil of the Island of Luzon, so renowned\r\nfor its natural magnificence of scenery, must involuntarily feel that his\r\nanticipations have been sorely disappointed; he will with all possible\r\ndiligence make the best of his way from the glaring white sands and black\r\nwalls of the fortress here to Manila, the next object of our hopes. A\r\nsmall screw plies daily between Cavite and the last-named city, and this\r\nvessel also conveyed the Expeditionists from Cavite to the capital of the\r\nPhilippine Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] Several copies of these various publications of the different\r\nscientific societies of Java were presented to the Expedition by the\r\nmembers of these learned bodies.\r\n\r\n[35] Still the chief article of cultivation is rice, which constitutes\r\nalmost the sole bread-stuff of the Javanese. Crauford in his admirably\r\ndigested dictionary of the Indian Archipelago calculates that the annual\r\nrice crop is about 500,000,000 lbs., and that each individual consumes\r\nannually one quarter, or 480 lbs.!\r\n\r\n[36] For some extremely beautiful and costly weapons used by the Malay\r\nraces we are especially indebted to Mr. J. Netscher, one of the directors\r\nof the Society of Arts and Sciences, a profound scholar in the various\r\nidioms spoken in Java, and who on the same occasion enriched our\r\ncollections with some of his own valuable numismatic specimens and\r\nphilological researches, and to this day neglects no opportunity of\r\nadvancing the special objects of our Expedition.\r\n\r\n[37] Only two of the various races of Java have remained constant to the\r\nbelief of their fathers, and still honour, some of them Buddha, some\r\nBrahma. Among these are the Badawis, who constitute all that remain of a\r\nonce mighty race at the east end of the island, among the hills of Kendang\r\nin the Residency of Bandang, on the Tenggers, also at the east of the\r\nisland in the Residency of Passeruwan, the former numbering 1500, the\r\nlatter about 4000 souls.\r\n\r\n[38] Garsick, the Grisse of modern days, was the first spot where these\r\njealous sectaries settled about the year 1374, and the two Arabic sheikhs\r\nDulla and Moellana are usually cited by later historians as the\r\nintroducers of the Mahometan worship into Java.\r\n\r\n[39] There are at present two kings reigning on the Island of Lombok: Ratu\r\nAgong Agong Suede Carang-assem, and Ratu Agong Agong Made Carang-assem.\r\nThese had submitted under special treaties to the Dutch Government, whose\r\nvassals they now are.\r\n\r\n[40] Yellow is the royal colour of the Ruler of Lombok. According to the\r\nprevalent custom, no one but the king and members of his family is\r\npermitted to use that colour in their dress or ornaments.\r\n\r\n[41] This peculiarity of Eastern manners is universally prevalent wherever\r\nOriental nations have come in contact with Europeans. It is of course as\r\nentirely unlike the genuine hospitality of the rude Bedouin or Tartar as\r\nit is possible to imagine, and seems to belong to an early and very\r\nimperfect notion of true refinement. Traces of it will be found in all\r\ncountries, even in Europe, and in its original form of making a present in\r\nthe expectation of receiving something more valuable in return, which lies\r\nat the bottom of all this pseudo-generosity. The astuteness of the Scotch\r\nHighlanders, themselves a race remarkably free from such meannesses, has\r\nhitched the system into a pithy proverb, the sense of which is to \"send a\r\nhen's egg in order to get a goose's in exchange.\"\r\n\r\n[42] 73.75 paals (posts) are equal to one degree of the equator, whence\r\none paal = within a small fraction of 4943 feet 6 inches. This method of\r\nindicating land-measure originated in the circumstance that on every road\r\nintersecting Java from west to east, the respective distances from the\r\nthree chief places, Batavia, Samarang, and Surabaya, are marked up upon\r\nwooden \"paale\" or posts.\r\n\r\n[43] As yet there are no railroads on the island. But a company has been\r\nformed with the intention of uniting the more important and productive\r\ndistricts of the island, an enterprise which will extend to about 1000\r\nmiles (English), and will cost about L8,500,000.\r\n\r\n[44] It is well known that Holland in former days recruited her black\r\nregiments of the Netherland Indies by men from the Gold Coast, and in fact\r\nhad set on foot a sort of traffic in men with the king of Ashantee.\r\n\r\n[45] Dr. Junghuhn, in his admirable work upon Java, describes the rainy\r\nseason--which usually has fairly set in by the month of January, when the\r\nwesterly and north-westerly winds are driving the rain-clouds before\r\nthem--in the following spirited language:--\"The floods stream from the\r\nclouds often for four-and-twenty hours at a stretch without the slightest\r\ninterruption, and with such violence that the noise of the plash of the\r\nfalling element drowns the voices of the inhabitants, compelled as they\r\nare to keep to their houses. Every brook and river overflows its banks,\r\ncovering with a tide of muddy brown water the alluvial soil wrested from\r\nthe bed of ocean, while the frogs croak incessantly day and night, and the\r\nlizards and snakes emerge from their holes, and creep into every corner of\r\nthe dwellings of every man; all through the hours of darkness is heard the\r\nloud thousand-voiced hum of insects, of myriads of mosquitoes, till it is\r\nhardly possible to find a dry place throughout the house. The hot, sultry\r\nair is saturated with moisture, so that everything becomes damp, in\r\nconsequence of the fine particles of the rain-vapour penetrating into the\r\ninmost corners of the house.\"\r\n\r\n[46] Pronounced _Chipannas_ (hot stream), from _Tji_, water, and _Pannas_,\r\nhot. _Tji_ is always pronounced like _chi_, and _oe_ like _oo_.\r\n\r\n[47] One can form some idea of the enormous fecundity of this insect, if\r\nwe mention that it takes 200,000 in a dried state to make one pound of the\r\ncochineal of commerce.\r\n\r\n[48] Two Vanilla plants, imported in 1841 from the Botanical Garden of\r\nLeyden, remained barren for nine years, till recourse was at last had to\r\nthe system of artificial fructification, upon which these plants increased\r\nso rapidly that the plants at present under cultivation at Pondok-Gedeh\r\namount to 700,000!\r\n\r\n[49] Now named _Cankrienia Chrysantha_. The plant most characteristic of\r\nthis region was the _gnaphalium arboreum_.\r\n\r\n[50] These four species were _Cinchona Calisaya_, _C. Condanimea_, _C.\r\nLanceolata_, and _C. Ovata_.\r\n\r\n[51] According to our latest advices from Java, which extend to November,\r\n1860, there are at present in the Preanger Regency upwards of 100,000\r\nChina plants in the very best order, so that this valuable commodity not\r\nonly may be regarded as fully naturalized in that island, but the Dutch\r\nGovernment even complied with the request of the British Government for a\r\ncertain number of seedlings for introduction into India.\r\n\r\n[52] Pronounce _Tschipodas_ and _Tschangschoor_ (Sweet Water)\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[53] Called in the Sunda dialect Gunung Masigit, or Hill of the Mosque, in\r\nconsequence of the chalk, of which it is composed, being broken into\r\npinnacles of remarkable uniformity, and strongly resembling the appearance\r\npresented by the minarets of a mosque.\r\n\r\n[54] As these edible swallows'-nests form a very important article of\r\ncommerce among the Colonial products, and their collection provides the\r\nmeans of subsistence to a considerable section of the population of Java,\r\nwe shall follow here the description given by Dr. Junghuhn, in his truly\r\nclassic Monograph upon Java, in which (Book I. p. 468) he speaks as\r\nfollows respecting the marvellous abodes selected by this species of\r\nswallow, and the perils dared by the native in obtaining their nests. \"In\r\nKarangbolong, a portion of the entrance to the holes where the swallows\r\nbreed is on a level with the surface of the water, and at times covered by\r\nthe sea. In one of these cavities, the Gua Gede, the edge of the\r\ncoast-wall rises 80 Paris feet above low water, in a concave form, so that\r\nit actually overhangs; however, at an elevation of about 25 feet there\r\noccurs a projection, which the Rotang-ladder reaches by being suspended\r\nperpendicularly. The ladder is made by two side ropes of reed, which every\r\ninch-and-a-half, or two inches, are bound to each other by cross-bars of\r\nwood. The roof of the entrance to the cave is only 10 feet above the sea,\r\nwhich even at ebb-tide washes the flow throughout its extent, while at\r\nflood-tide the mouth of the cave is entirely closed by the sweep of the\r\nrollers. Only during ebb-tide therefore, and with perfectly smooth water,\r\nis it possible for any one to penetrate into the interior. Even then this\r\nwould be impossible, were not the rocky vault, or roof of the cavern,\r\npierced through, eaten away, and corroded into innumerable holes. By the\r\nprojecting angles of these holes it is that the strongest and most daring\r\ngatherer who first makes his way in, has to hold on, while he attaches to\r\nthem ropes made of Rotang, which thus hang from the roof to a length of\r\nfour or five feet. At their lower extremities other Rotang ropes are\r\nsecurely fastened crosswise, thus running, rather more horizontally,\r\nparallel with the roof, so that they form a hanging bridge as it were\r\nalong the whole length of the roof. The roof is about 100 feet wide, and\r\nfrom the entrance at the south to the deepest recess in the north end, the\r\ncave is about 150 feet in length. Although only 10 feet high at the\r\nentrance, the roof becomes gradually more and more lofty as the cavern\r\nretreats, till at the farthest extremity it is about 20 to 25 feet above\r\nthe sea-level. Before any one of the nest-hunters proceeds to erect his\r\nladder, and again before proceeding to climb up upon it in such fearful\r\nproximity to the thundering swell, a solemn prayer is proffered to the\r\ngoddess or queen of the sea-coast, whose blessing is invoked. At this\r\nplace she bears the name of _Njai-Ratu-Segor-Kidul_, or sometimes\r\n_Ratu-Loro-Djunggrang_, and has dedicated to her in the village of\r\nKarangbolong a temple, which is kept scrupulously clean. Occasionally the\r\ngatherers make also a solemn sacrifice at the tomb of _Serot_, who,\r\naccording to a Javanese legend, is revered as the first discoverer of the\r\nbird-nest caves.\" (The meaning of the above Javanese words is as follows:\r\n_Njai_, the title of honour of a female, corresponding to our\r\n\"Madame:\"--_Ratu_, Queen:--_Segoro_, ocean:--_Kidul_, south:--_Lero_,\r\nmaiden:--_Djunggrang_ is a surname.)

The civet-cat, too (called _Luah_ in\r\nJavanese, Jjaruh in the Sunda language), does great damage to the coffee\r\nplantations, just as the crop is being collected. It eats only the fleshy\r\npart of the brown berry, the beans, at least according to what the\r\nJavanese say, actually gaining a flavour by the process to which they are\r\nsubjected in the maw of the animal!\r\n\r\n[61] In 1859 the most important of the colonial products, grown for\r\naccount of the Government, presented the following quantities:--\r\n\r\n  Coffee                      piculs 727,000 (of 125 lbs. each)\r\n  Sugar                         \"    901,000.\r\n  Indigo                                                    558,800 lbs.\r\n  Cassia                                                    256,000  \"\r\n  Cochineal (a failure in the crops owing to incessant rains) 6,700  \"\r\n  Tea                                                     2,057,400  \"\r\n  Pepper                                                     45,000  \"\r\n\r\nThe duties on imports and exports for that year in the islands of Java and\r\nMadura alone amounted to 7,440,579 guilders, or L620,048.\r\n\r\nN.B.

The prince was extremely delighted when he\r\nwas informed of it, and said he longed for the hour when the imperial\r\ndecoration was to arrive that he might put it on and wear it. Singularly\r\nenough the presents and letters of acknowledgment sent to the Dutch\r\nGovernment in the Hague for remittance, were not forwarded direct by the\r\nmail steamer, but as customary by sailing vessels, so that they only\r\narrived six months after they were presented!\r\n\r\n[63] A genuine Javanese musical instrument, consisting of a number of\r\nbells all differently tuned, which are struck with two small\r\nbamboo-sticks.\r\n\r\n[64] Die Republic Costa Rica, in Central-America, mit besonderer\r\nBeruecksichtigung der Naturverhaeltnisse, und der frage der deutschen\r\nAnswanderung und Colonisation.

He appears to be, like so many other of our\r\nexcellent friends in Java, a living contradiction to the proverb, \"Out of\r\nsight, out of mind,\" as he has since the return of the Expedition already\r\nsent over as presents to the museums of our native country, valuable\r\nselections of curious objects of natural history from the Indian\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\n[66] The Loar-Badang (Public Market) is an immense building, a sort of\r\nbrothel on a large scale, kept by a Frenchman, who pays a handsome annual\r\nsum to Government for the privilege of his infamous traffic.

In the year 1857\r\nalone, 2525 coloured criminals were sentenced to hard labour, with or\r\nwithout chains. The number of convictions in the Dutch East Indies,\r\nexclusive of Java and Madura, amounted in the same year to 4430.\r\n\r\n[68] Thus the \"Prima donna\" receives for tragic opera 1500 guilders\r\n(L125), and for comic opera 1800 guilders (L150) per month during the\r\nseason.

Dr. Van den Broek, who is\r\nat present engaged in the editing a dictionary of the Dutch and Japanese\r\nlanguages, presented us with a botanical work in Japanese with numerous\r\nwoodcuts, and at the same time was so exceedingly kind as to present us\r\nwith a small vocabulary of the Court and the popular dialects used in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n[70] Among scientific circles in Batavia the recent departure of the\r\nrenowned ichthyologist, Dr. Bleeker, who intends to settle in Holland or\r\nGermany, will be the more appreciated, that this resolve will be regarded\r\nby his numerous European friends as a satisfactory assurance that the\r\nvaluable materials relating to natural history which he has collected will\r\nere long make their appearance in a suitable form.\r\n\r\n[71] Voyagers between Batavia and Manila must not, however, always expect\r\nto make so rapid a voyage.

As we had\r\nhitherto come into contact for the most part with the Anglo-Saxon race and\r\nits colonies, it was naturally doubly interesting to have an opportunity\r\nof becoming likewise acquainted with the results of civilization and\r\ncolonization as exemplified by what are called the Romaic or Latin\r\nbranches of the great Caucasian family, and by personal examination to\r\nsatisfy ourselves in what fashion the Castilians have succeeded in\r\nidentifying their own advantages with those of the natives of these\r\nislands. True it is, that the history of the earlier Spanish dependencies\r\nis by no means calculated to heighten our regard for the wisdom and\r\nmildness of the colonial policy of Spain, or to give a particularly\r\nfavourable impression of the political and social condition of the\r\nPhilippine Islands. A state, whose power at the commencement of the\r\npresent century was still beaming in all its lustre, who has lost the\r\nfairest and most fertile lands on the face of the earth, which it had\r\npossessed for above three hundred years, without the slightest attempt to\r\ndefend them, whose Government, through its inflexible adherence to\r\nobsolete forms and ordinances, after the dizzy pre-eminence of ruling the\r\nworld has dwindled into a power of the third class,--leaves nothing to\r\nhope that any part of its organization should have remained intact, that\r\nthe canker in its political and social proclivities, which so suddenly and\r\nso disastrously brought about the downfal of one of the mightiest and\r\nmost extended empires in the world, should not likewise have made its\r\nappearance in the Philippines. However, it is precisely these\r\nconsiderations which make the contrast between the colonies founded by the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race in remote regions of the globe, and those of the Spanish,\r\nPortuguese, Dutch, and so forth, so valuable and instructive, although a\r\nrigid analysis of the causes which have conduced to the present condition\r\nof the majority of the countries conquered and ruled by races of Latin\r\norigin, must necessarily impress the unprejudiced inquirer in a sense\r\nlittle flattering to these latter, namely, that the history of every\r\nquarter of the globe would have assumed an entirely different aspect had\r\nthese countries been first discovered and colonized by the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace, with its watchwords of freedom and religious toleration, instead of\r\nthe Spaniard or Portuguese, with tyranny and fanaticism inscribed on its\r\nbanners.\r\n\r\nThe Archipelago of the Philippines comprises those numerous islands and\r\nislets between the parallels of 5 deg. and 21 deg. N., and which are scattered\r\nbetween the North Pacific Ocean on the east and the Chinese Sea on the\r\nwest. The entire group, which, according to the Spanish account, consists\r\nof not fewer than 408 islands, extends over 16 deg. of latitude by 9 deg. of\r\nlongitude, covering a superficial area of 91,000 square miles, or about\r\nthe dimensions of England, Ireland, and Wales, exclusive of Scotland. Only\r\ntwo islands however of the whole cluster are of considerable dimensions,\r\nviz. Luzon, or Manila, which is about the same size as Galicia, Moravia,\r\nand Silesia taken together, and Mindanao, which, in superficial area, is\r\nabout equal to Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola.\r\n\r\nAs in size, so in fertility, natural advantages, and commerce, Luzon is\r\nthe most important island in the Archipelago, as it is likewise one of the\r\nmost delightful spots in the tropics. The climate is adapted to the\r\ncultivation of all the plants and various forms of vegetation alike of the\r\ntorrid and the temperate zones. On the coast the thermometer never falls\r\nbelow 71 deg.6 Fahr., nor rises above 95 deg. Fahr. In the highland valley of\r\nBanjanao, 6000 feet above the level of the sea, albeit not above 36 miles\r\ndistant from Manila, the thermometer frequently descends as low as 44 deg.6\r\nFahr. The highest register of the thermometer is during the rainy\r\nmonths,[72] from May to September; but we were assured over and over again\r\nthat in Manila the heat is very equably distributed over the entire year,\r\nand never attains such a high degree as many summer days in Madrid. The\r\nmost valuable and most extensively used plants of the tropical and\r\nsub-tropical zones, suck as sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, maize,\r\ntobacco, and rice, flourish here. The forests abound in all the most\r\nvaluable descriptions of cabinet-wood, but the narrow-minded illiberality\r\nthat has always characterized the colonial policy of Spain, the\r\nnumberless restrictions to which her commerce is subjected, do not admit\r\nof that magnificent development of which this insular cluster, so\r\nabounding in natural wealth, would be susceptible under a more free-souled\r\nrule. The Spaniards have conquered and have subjugated the islands,\r\nfanatical monks have what they call Christianized the people, but, during\r\nthe three hundred years that the Castilian has held the supremacy here,\r\nlittle if anything has been done for the prosperity and development of the\r\ncountry, or the intellectual and moral advancement of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands were discovered by Magelhaens and Pigafetta on the\r\n17th March, 1521, nearly twenty-nine years after the discovery of America\r\nby Columbus, and two years after the conquest of Mexico by Fernando\r\nCortez. In consonance with the religious customs of that age, the group\r\nwas named by Magelhaens \"The Archipelago of St. Lazarus,\" because the day\r\non which it was discovered corresponded with the fete-day of that saint in\r\nthe calendar. But the discovery did not imply the conquest of the\r\nArchipelago. Four expeditions were dispatched at various intervals,\r\nwithout their succeeding in subduing the natives. The solitary result\r\nobtained thence was, that the commander of the fourth expedition, that of\r\n1542, Don Ruy Lopez de Villalobos by name, changed the Scriptural name of\r\nthe Archipelago for that by which it is at present known, in honour of the\r\nprince of Asturias (then 15 years old), afterwards Philip II.\r\n\r\nIt was not till a fifth expedition had started in 1565, forty-one years\r\nafter the first discovery of the Archipelago by Magelhaens, that the\r\nconquest was finally completed. The leader of this was Miguel Lopez de\r\nLegaspi, a man noways inferior to a Cortez or a Pizarro in venturesomeness\r\nof spirit, inflexible perseverance, and brilliant courage, and in humanity\r\nfar exceeding either. His squadron consisted of five ships, and his entire\r\nforce, including soldiers and mariners, was but 400 men.\r\n\r\nOn 21st November, 1564, Legaspi sailed from Port Natividad in Spain, and\r\non 16th February, 1565, hove in sight of the Philippines. The hardy\r\nnavigator was accompanied by a number of Augustinian monks, who in the\r\nsubsequent subjugation of the islands proved far more serviceable than his\r\nsoldiers. The superior of these monks, Fray Andres de Urdaneta, a very\r\nremarkable man, had commanded a ship in the first expedition, and had\r\nafterwards been admitted into the order of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nFour years after their arrival at the Philippines, and after they had\r\nsubdued the native inhabitants of the fertile islands of Cebu and Panay,\r\nLegaspi first discovered Luzon, and there in the year 1571 founded the\r\ncity of Manila. Since this first conquest the Spaniards have by no means\r\nbeen permitted to retain undisturbed possession of this smiling cluster of\r\nislands. Not alone the Portuguese and the Dutch bestirred themselves at\r\nvarious intervals to drive the Spaniards out of the Archipelago, but the\r\nEnglish likewise, in 1762, towards the close of the Seven Years' War,\r\ninvaded these settlements.[73]\r\n\r\nThe area conquered, however, did not extend further inland than to a\r\ndistance of ten miles from the walls of the city, and after an occupation\r\nof ten months, Manila was restored to the Crown of Spain by the Peace of\r\nParis, 1763. Since that memorable period, the Philippine group has\r\nremained uninterruptedly under the dominion of the Spaniards, and has up\r\nto the present day been a faithful dependent of the Royal House of\r\nCastile. In fact, with the exception of Cuba and Porto Rico, the\r\nPhilippine and Marianne Archipelagoes are the sole colonies that Spain\r\nstill retains of her once so enormous possessions in the distant portions\r\nof the globe, although in Manila even in our own day, as will be more\r\nfully detailed presently, despite her honourable distinction of \"_La\r\nSiempre real ciudad_\" (The Ever Loyal city), there is no lack of\r\ndiscontent, and the generally prevailing \"loyal tranquillity\" is, none the\r\nless, boding many serious perils for the Spanish supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe most striking peculiarity of the natural configuration of Luzon[74]\r\nis its strongly-marked separation into two peninsulas, a northern, which\r\ncomprises the larger portion, and a southern, smaller island; the former\r\nnamed Luzon by the Spanish, the latter Camarinas. The length of the entire\r\nisland, including its numerous curves, is about 550 miles, and its\r\ngreatest width about 135 miles, but in many places it is little more than\r\nthirty miles in breadth. The chain of the Caraballos mountains traverse\r\nLuzon from north to south, and sends off spurs in various directions,\r\nwhich impart an exceeding hilly aspect to the entire island.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards divide Luzon into three main divisions; Costa, Contra-Costa,\r\nand Centro, corresponding pretty nearly with the western side, the eastern\r\nside, and the interior of the island, and formerly indicating in what\r\norder these different sections of the country had been subjected to the\r\nSpanish dominion. The latest distribution is into 35 provinces and 12\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nManila, the capital of Luzon, as also of the whole Archipelago, and the\r\noldest European settlement in this region of the globe, lies at the mouth\r\nof a small but rather rapid river, the Pasig, which after a course of\r\nabout 30 miles, draws off to the sea the waters of the great Bay-Lake\r\n(_Laguna de Bay_). In consequence of a not very conveniently situated\r\nmole, the Pasig is forming a bar close to its own embouchure, which makes\r\nit somewhat dangerous for boats to attempt an entrance in bad weather.\r\nShips, however, can anchor about 1-1/2 miles below the fortified walls of\r\nthe city, which, though impregnable to the attack of a native force, would\r\nprobably be found powerless to repel a European force attacking from\r\nseaward.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Scientific Commission started from Cavite, where the\r\nfrigate lay at anchor, in the small steamer which plies daily to the\r\ncapital, which, when beheld from a distance, with its gloomy, lofty,\r\ndefiant fortifications, and its dense clusters of monastic buildings and\r\nchurch towers, gives the impression rather of some great Catholic Mission\r\nthan a place of commerce. In the roads there were not above 16 ships lying\r\nat anchor, whereas we counted 165 in Singapore, a disproportion which,\r\nconsidering the favourable site of Manila and its wealth in all manner of\r\nvaluable produce, can only be accounted for by the pressure of political\r\nand administrative regulations, which weigh like a mountain upon trade and\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nOn pulling up the river from its mouth, where it is about 300 feet wide,\r\nwe find ourselves in the vicinity of the light-house, in front of a dense\r\nmass of the inevitable filthy bamboo huts, which being inhabited by the\r\nvery poorest section of the population, increase the dismal, gloomy\r\nimpression left by the first view of the city. We land in the\r\nneighbourhood of the harbour-master's office, and have to pick our steps\r\nthrough a dirty quarter of the town in order to reach the focus of public\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe river Pasig divides Manila Proper from its sister city of Binondo. Two\r\nhandsome bridges, one an old-fashioned stone one, the other a modern\r\nsuspension bridge of imposing dimensions, form the communication between\r\nthe two cities. Manila, situate on the southern or left bank, and enclosed\r\non all sides with ditches and fortifications, has all the peculiar\r\nfeatures of a Spanish town of the ancient type. It consists of eight\r\nstraight, narrow streets, all running in one direction. Within these are\r\nmost of the public buildings; the Governor-general's Palace and that of\r\nthe Archbishop, the Municipality, the Supreme Courts, the Cathedral, the\r\nArsenal, the Barracks. Profound silence reigns in the grass-grown streets,\r\nbetween the gloomy masses of stone, of which at least one-third are Church\r\nproperty. There is no evidence anywhere of joyous life or social progress,\r\nand the variegated, charming flower-garden, lately laid out in the square\r\nin front of the Cathedral, stands out like a solitary gay picture, amid\r\naustere, sombre, historical paintings of vanished might and faded\r\nsplendour. Within the walls of this melancholy old city only Spaniards and\r\ntheir descendants may dwell, all other races being excluded from this\r\nprivilege. The number of inhabitants within the fortifications does not\r\nprobably exceed 10,000 souls.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Binondo, on the northern or right bank of the river, is\r\nthe true business city and head-quarters of trade. Here Europeans,\r\nChinese, Malays, and their endless intermixtures of blood, amounting in\r\nall to more than 140,000 souls, reside in the most perfect harmony with\r\neach other; here are all the warehouses, shops, and manufactories; here\r\nprevails from morning till night a perpetual whirl of busy, cheerful\r\ncrowds circulating through the streets, of which that called the Escolta\r\nis the most frequented, as it is the handsomest and most attractive. The\r\nhouses, on account of the frequency of earthquakes, are usually one storey\r\nhigh, enclosing large courts (_patios_), and very frequently with a sort\r\nof terrace on the roof. The interiors of the houses have an unusually\r\nspacious appearance, owing to their almost universally having but little\r\nfurniture, in many cases simply a number of chairs ranged along the walls.\r\nBut the most singular aspect of these houses is to be found in the\r\nwindows, the panes of most of them being made, not of glass, but of the\r\nshell of a species of oyster (_Placuna Placenta_), ground down to the\r\nrequisite thinness! The subdued light which is thus obtained is\r\nexceedingly grateful, and these mussel-shells have been found to be\r\ncheaper and more lasting than panes of glass, which, in a country so\r\nfrequently visited by earthquakes and hurricanes, could only be replaced\r\nwhen injured at an immense expense. The streets are rather narrow, so much\r\nso that linen awnings are stretched across the streets from one row of\r\nshops to that opposite, thus securing to the foot-passenger the\r\ninestimable boon of being able during the hottest hours of the day to\r\ntraverse almost every street in Binondo under shade.\r\n\r\nThat which the stranger understands by the emphatic word \"comfort\" is only\r\nto be found in the houses of European residents, and is not obtainable by\r\nmoney. The two hotels lately started to levy, unchallenged, Californian\r\nprices for even the most moderate requirements, and so far as cleanliness\r\nand orderliness are concerned, lag far behind the commonest country inn in\r\nNorth America or the British colonies.[75]\r\n\r\nDespite the various races that meet the stranger's gaze, Manila has,\r\nbeyond any other colony in the East, the appearance of a European town.\r\nOne remarks here, that the colonists are more completely amalgamated with\r\nthe natives, and that with the religion these latter have also adopted a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the customs of Europeans.\r\n\r\nAmong the populace of Manila belonging to the coloured races, that most\r\nprevalent in the capital is the Tagal, or Tagalag, on whose territory the\r\nSpaniards founded their first settlement. The obscurity that envelopes\r\ntheir origin has never been dispelled, although some of the older\r\nreligious writers thought they found on Borneo and other islands of the\r\nSunda Archipelago some traces of their stock. They were confirmed in this\r\nimpression by the fact, that in the most cultivated dialects and idioms\r\nof the Tagal is to be found an unusually great number of Malay and\r\nJavanese words. The majority of the plants cultivated here, such as rice,\r\nsugar-cane, yam, indigo, cocoa-palm, as also all domestic animals, many of\r\nthe metals, and even the digits used in enumeration, are, although greatly\r\ncorrupted, directly traceable to the corresponding words or names in\r\nMalay. Moreover, there is a tradition very prevalent throughout Luzon,\r\nthat the Spaniards, at their first arrival in this Archipelago, found\r\ncertain Bornese officials here, who were levying taxes and tithes for the\r\nRajahs resident in that island.\r\n\r\nNext in number to the Tagals rank the Chinese with their descendants, and\r\nto these succeed the Spaniards, with their offspring born in the country,\r\nwho amount together to barely 5000, or about a 28th of the whole\r\npopulation of the capital; of Spaniards of pure descent, there are not\r\nabove 300 in Manila.[76]\r\n\r\nBesides the Tagal there is in this Archipelago yet another race, the\r\n_Negritos_, who only inhabit the mountain districts of the islands of\r\nLuzon, Mindoro, Panay, Negros, and Mindanao, and are estimated at about\r\n25,000 souls. These Negritos del Monte, or Negrillos, also called Aeta,\r\nAigta, Ite, Inapta, and Igorote, are small in physical conformation as\r\ncompared with their African congeners. The characteristic features of the\r\nnegro are less strongly marked, the colour of their skin and their\r\ncomplexion are both less black. For this reason old Spanish authors speak\r\nof them as \"_menos negro y menos feo_\" (less negro-like and less hideous).\r\nOwing to their small stature, which does not average above 4 feet 8 inches\r\nEnglish, they have received the appellation of Negritos (diminutive\r\nNegroes). By Spanish writers upon the Philippines they have been described\r\nas a still existent branch of the lowest type of humanity, without fixed\r\ndwellings, without regular employment, eking out a bare subsistence on\r\nroots and wild fruits, and such animals as they could bring down with the\r\nbow and arrow, their only weapon. Through the kind offices of Mr. Grahame,\r\nwe had an opportunity of gratifying our curiosity to see an individual of\r\nthis singular race of Negritos. This was a girl of about 12 or 14 years of\r\nage, of dwarf-like figure, with woolly hair, broad nostrils, but without\r\nthe dark skin and wide everted lips which characterize the negro type.\r\nThis pleasing-looking, symmetrically formed girl had been brought up in\r\nthe house of a Spaniard, apparently with the pious object of rescuing her\r\nsoul from heathenism. The poor little Negrilla hardly understood her own\r\nmother tongue, besides a very little Tagal, so that we had considerable\r\ndifficulty in understanding each other. The received opinion that the\r\nNegrillos and the Igorotes are of a distinct race, but having some\r\naffinity with the Papuans of New Guinea, seems to us for many reasons very\r\nproblematical. We are as yet far too little acquainted with the races\r\ninhabiting the most inaccessible parts of the island, to be able to\r\npronounce a correct opinion upon such a point. The probabilities are not\r\nless that the Negritos and Igorotes stand in the same relation to the\r\ndwellers on the coast as the Bushmen to the Hottentots, the Weddahs to the\r\nCingalese, or the savages of Sambalong to the natives of the rest of the\r\nNicobars.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish language is only available in Manila and the vicinity;--a few\r\nmiles in the interior, even in places which hold almost daily\r\ncommunication with Manila, Tagal is much more commonly used. At present\r\nTagal is written and printed exclusively in the Roman character. While in\r\nManila, we never once saw a book or MS. in which the ancient character had\r\nbeen used. Even the oldest printed matter, such as, for instance, a Tagal\r\ngrammar, published in Manila in 1610, contains only a few samples of the\r\nnative alphabet, while as to its original arrangement, as also the form of\r\nthe numerals, the utmost uncertainty prevails. The entire alphabet, which,\r\nincluding the three vowels, consists of but 17 letters, comprises the\r\nfollowing characters:\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: Each of the italicized character groups below\r\ndesignate the Roman equivalent to a Tagal character. The Tagal character\r\ncan not be rendered here.

The hair of the head is rigid, bristly, and black;\r\nthe beard very sparse. They all wear European clothes more or less,\r\nalthough the fashion in which they wear them is quite peculiar and\r\nludicrously odd. Not merely do the lower orders and servants wear the\r\nshirt ironed perfectly smooth and unwrinkled, instead of a coat, above\r\ntheir continuations, but the Tagal dandy prides himself on his\r\nwell-lacquered boots, his white stockings, his new Paris silk hat worn\r\nwith a jaunty cock to one side, and above all his carefully plaited\r\nresplendent white shirt, as he struts through the streets of Manila,\r\ncigaret in his mouth, and swinging an elegant little cane! The women wear,\r\nlike the Javanese women, the \"Sarong,\" a parti-coloured striped cotton\r\ndress, rolled round the loins, and a close-fitting very short jacket, so\r\nshort indeed that between it and the gown a space about an inch wide\r\nintervenes through which the naked body is visible, while the fine\r\ntransparent gauze-like stuff of which the jacket is made is much better\r\ncalculated to show off than to conceal their attractions. This universal\r\nfashion of dress is the more surprising, as the various orders of monks\r\nexercise in all other respects an almost despotic control over the\r\nnatives, and as it is much more attributable to their influence than to\r\nthat of the secular authorities that the speech, manners, and customs of\r\nold Castile have taken firm and extensive root in the Philippines. It\r\nseems, however, unjust to compare this group of islands, as has been done\r\nby modern writers, on account of the all-pervading influence of the\r\nSpanish element, with a province of Spain, in contradistinction to the\r\ncolonies of other nations, where the Europeans have always been regarded\r\nby the natives as the lords of a conquered country. The English in India,\r\nCeylon, and New Zealand, and the Dutch in Java, all appear to have a much\r\nfirmer and more secure footing than the Spaniards, despite their having\r\nmingled with the people. How little can be effected by forced amalgamation\r\nof speech and manners, is best illustrated by the late separation of\r\nCentral and Southern America from the Spanish rule, although in most of\r\nthese countries the majority of the people speak only Spanish, and are\r\ngoverned entirely in accordance with Spanish customs. Much better founded\r\nseems to us the observation that it was less the sword than the cross of\r\nSpain which brought the Philippines under the throne of Castile, and that\r\nthe natives have become Spanish Christians, without being Spanish\r\nsubjects. The entire Archipelago is nothing but one rich church domain, a\r\nsafe retreat for the legion of Spanish monks, who are able to lord it here\r\nwith unrestrained power. There is a Governor-general of the Philippines\r\nonly so long as it pleases the Augustinian, Dominican, and Franciscan\r\nfriars; and if ever an insurrection breaks out in the Archipelago,\r\ndesigned to shake off the Spanish yoke, there will be more than one monk\r\nto head the movement.\r\n\r\nIn a country where the cloister and its denizens interfere so arbitrarily\r\nin all the concerns of life, and impart to the capital itself, as indeed\r\nto the entire Archipelago, a character entirely peculiar to itself,\r\nreligious establishments and their zealous occupants call for special\r\nconsideration, and the reader need assuredly feel no surprise that we\r\nshould begin the narrative of our visit to the capital of the Philippines\r\nby a description of its monasteries. In Manila these unfortunately are\r\nnot, as they were in the middle ages, the nurseries of culture and\r\ncivilization, of science and art, but rather give the impression of being\r\nsimply huge establishments for the maintenance of zealous souls, weary of\r\nlife, who wish to close their days of labour in tranquil contemplation,\r\nexempt from all anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe four orders of monks to whose hands are confided the entire spiritual\r\nand very much of the secular well-being of the inhabitants of the\r\nPhilippines, are the Augustines (_Agustinos Calzados_--sandalled friars),\r\nthe Franciscans, the Dominicans, and the barefoot Augustinian mendicants\r\n(_Agustinos descalzados_ or _Recoletos_).\r\n\r\nThe monastery of the Bare-Foot Friars, lying close to the wall of the\r\nfortifications, consists of a number of spacious buildings, some of which\r\ndate from the 17th century. Everything here tells of former power and\r\nsplendour. From the billiard-room and parlour on the first storey, the eye\r\nis charmed by a marvellous landscape commanding the Bay of Manila and the\r\nmountains that surround it. How delightful must it be in the evening\r\ntwilight to pace these airy chambers in the society of congenial souls,\r\nand, while the brow is fanned by the cool sea-breeze, to give free scope\r\nto the reins of fancy, as it swept far away over the Bay of Manila! For\r\nwhat privations must not such a source of pure exquisite enjoyment\r\nindemnify the ascetic brethren of the cloister! That spiritual meditation\r\nand converse however do not form the sole topics discussed in these\r\ndepartments, was abundantly evidenced by the hints let fall by several of\r\nthe monks who conducted us through the various corridors and apartments,\r\nand who were constantly indulging in visions of Carlist supremacy and a\r\nreturn of the halcyon days of monasticism. On our remarking that so far as\r\nworldly consideration was concerned, the cloister enjoyed far more cordial\r\nsupport in Manila than either in Spain or Cuba, one of the Augustinians\r\nwho was accompanying us, a tall commanding figure, attired in the plain\r\ngarb of the order, replied: \"The Government knows that it has need of us,\r\nthat it could not get on a day without us, therefore it leaves us in\r\npeace, and places no impediments in our path as in Spain.\"[78] And he was\r\nright. Whensoever the monks lift the finger, Spain has ceased to rule in\r\nthe Philippines. The spiritual reins have ever bridled the secular\r\nauthority, and such a state of things is the severest impediment to the\r\ndevelopment of the country and its intellectual growth.\r\n\r\nOf the various monastic orders resident in Manila the Augustinians are by\r\nfar the best educated. They have made the various dialects of the native\r\nraces their study far more deeply than the other orders. The \"_Flora de\r\nlas Filipinas_,\" the _only_ botanical work which has ever been published\r\nin the Spanish language, treating of this interesting Archipelago, was\r\ncompiled by an Augustinian monk, Fray Manuel Blanco.[79]\r\n\r\nThe number of monks resident in the monastery of Manila when we were there\r\nwas 48, but there was room enough for three times as many. Altogether\r\nthere were of the Augustinian order 58 monasteries and parishes in the\r\nisland of Luzon, extending from one end of the island to the other. In the\r\nentire Archipelago there are, according to public documents, 145\r\nAugustinian monks, whose authority extends over 14 provinces and 153\r\nvillages, numbering 1,615,051 souls.[80]\r\n\r\nThe monastery of the Dominicans is kept clean and comfortable, and its\r\nwide spacious apartments leave a less vivid impression of decay and human\r\nindifference than the majority of the monastic edifices. Here also the\r\nlofty, light chambers in the upper storeys command a magnificent prospect.\r\nThe Prior, Padre Vellinchon, received the Austrian travellers with much\r\ncordiality, and conducted them in person round all the apartments of the\r\nvery extensive building. He spoke Latin pretty fluently, and without the\r\npeculiar Spanish accent, besides possessing a slight acquaintance with\r\nFrench; and was somewhat better informed upon European matters than his\r\nspiritual _confreres_. The library of the order is not kept in the\r\nconvent, but in one of the buildings of the University of St. Thomas also\r\nused by the Dominicans, but it is quite unimportant, whether as regards\r\nthe number of works it contains or their scientific value.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual jurisdiction of the Dominicans extends over eight provinces\r\nof the Archipelago, including 76 villages, with in all 427,593 souls,\r\nwhose eternal interests are watched over by 76 brethren of the order.[81]\r\n\r\nA Dominican friar, Joaquin Fonseca, is president of the permanent\r\ncommission of Censorship of Books, consisting in all of nine members, five\r\nof whom are nominated by Government and four by the Archbishop of\r\nManila.[82] We had the pleasure of being made acquainted with Fray\r\nJoaquin Fonseca, who also holds the appointment of Professor of Theology\r\nin the University of St. Thomas, and were presented by him with a copy of\r\nan imperfect epic poem composed in Spanish, which had for subject the\r\nhistory of the island of Luzon and its inhabitants.[83] Of this\r\ninteresting fragment we shall publish a translation in another place.\r\n\r\nJust as we were leaving the Dominican monastery, its worthy Prior begged\r\nour acceptance, by way of souvenir of our visit, of a copy of Dante's\r\nDivina Commedia in the original text, and a dictionary of the Ybanac, one\r\nof the idioms most extensively used throughout the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of the Franciscans presents no other feature of interest,\r\nthan in so far as it is an emblem of the melancholy spiritual decay in\r\nwhich the members of this order at present find themselves in Manila. The\r\ndirt and untidiness which were not merely apparent in the various\r\napartments, but which were even but too obvious in the external appearance\r\nof the brothers of the order, make a most disagreeable impression; for\r\npoverty and necessity, these two cardinal principles of the mendicant\r\norders, are by no means incompatible with cleanliness and neatness.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans possess 16 missions in 14 of the provinces, comprising\r\n159 villages and 749,804 inhabitants.[84] The spiritual instruction of\r\nthese is intrusted to 184 brethren of the order, 74 priests, and 43\r\n_Clerigos Interinos_ (occasional preachers).\r\n\r\nThe monastery of the _Recoletos_, or Reformed Augustinians, offers a not\r\nless impressive prospect than that of the Franciscans. Here, too, the\r\noccupants permit to appear a careless indifference utterly destructive of\r\nthe value of their ghostly ministration. As we entered, the brethren of\r\nthe order had finished their mid-day repast. Some of the monks were still\r\nsitting in a dirty, gloomy verandah round a table on which was spread a\r\ntable-cloth stained with food and drink, while in front of each stood a\r\nhalf-empty wineglass. A lay brother announced us, upon which one of the\r\nmonks rose to bid us welcome. From his rather jovial appearance, and the\r\nsuspicious colour of his nose, we presumed he was the cellarer, and were\r\nnot a little surprised when, in the course of conversation, he announced\r\nthat it was the Prior himself who was speaking with us.\r\n\r\nWe had the utmost difficulty in making the brethren, whose information was\r\nof a most limited extent, comprehend from what country we came. The\r\ncircumstance that the original German name _Oesterreich_ is pronounced\r\nAustria in Spanish, puzzled still more hopelessly the comprehension of\r\nthe monks, whose geographical knowledge did not seem to extend much\r\nbeyond the sphere of their vision. At first they confounded Austria with\r\nAustralia, and fancied we must have come direct from the fifth quarter of\r\nthe globe, but when the _Novara_ voyagers, proud of their Fatherland,\r\nrefused to permit this opinion to pass current, and gave a more clear\r\nexplanation, one of the younger monks thought he had at last found out our\r\n_habitat_, and evidently priding himself on having solved the riddle, gave\r\nhis less ingenious brethren to understand that we came, not from\r\nAustralia, but from Asturias, and were consequently fellow-countrymen! The\r\nlimited intelligence of the Franciscan mistook Austria for Asturias, and\r\nmade of the Austrian Empire a Spanish province! Lest the hypothesis should\r\nsuggest itself to the reader, that this confusion of foreign empires with\r\ndomestic provinces might possibly have originated in our not being\r\nacquainted with the language of the country, it is necessary that we\r\nshould inform him that one member of the Expedition was thoroughly versed\r\nin Spanish, so as to be able to maintain fluent conversation, and that he\r\nwas perfectly comprehended upon all other topics. Just as little must it\r\nbe supposed that the above anecdote is but an ill-natured imputation, or\r\nthe expression of a long-vanished national jealousy, or anything else than\r\na proof of the present state of education among the present occupants of\r\nthe monasteries of Manila.\r\n\r\nThe Recoletos watch over the spiritual weal of 567,416[85] children\r\nbelonging to parishes in the various islands of the Archipelago, and\r\nnumber 127 brethren.\r\n\r\nIn each monastery there is what is called a _Procuracion_, where the\r\nvarious printed books published by the order (almost exclusively\r\ndictionaries and grammars of the native languages and dialects) are sold\r\nfor the behoof of the funds of the monastery. The members of our\r\nExpedition exerted themselves to form a very complete collection of all\r\nsuch publications; and while thus engaged they also succeeded in getting\r\nseveral MS. treatises on language.[86] Works and memoirs on the history of\r\nthe island and the state of its inhabitants are scarcely met with in the\r\nwretchedly deficient libraries of the monasteries, which consist of not\r\nmore than 500 or 600 volumes, mostly works of theology and philosophy.\r\nWhatever of valuable literary material may once have belonged to these\r\ninstitutions has apparently been removed to Spain, whose libraries have\r\nalso gradually absorbed the literary treasures of the monasteries of\r\nCentral and Southern America.\r\n\r\nBesides the monasteries, Government Square (Plaza de Gobierno), in the\r\ninner portion of the city, possesses some little interest for strangers.\r\nIt has the shape of a large oblong, surrounded on each of its four sides\r\nby the palace of the Governor-general, that of the archbishop, the\r\ncathedral, and the law offices, with a well-kept garden-plot in the\r\ncentre, in which is a handsome statue of Charles IV., the whole strongly\r\nrecalling the principal square in the Havanna. The cathedral is equally as\r\nremarkable for the clumsiness of its exterior as for the profusion of\r\nperishable gold and silver within. The first edifice was erected by\r\nLegaspi, the conqueror of Luzon, in 1571, and was composed of bamboo-cane\r\nthatched with palm-leaves. The present temple was built in 1654 during the\r\npapacy of Innocent X., after several previous buildings had been\r\ndestroyed, some by fire, others by earthquake. The palace of the\r\nCaptain-general is an extensive but very simple building, with long wide\r\ncorridors internally, but which can make no pretensions to architectural\r\nmagnificence externally. In one of its saloons our Commodore and his\r\ncompanions were received by the Captain-general of the Philippines, Don\r\nFernando Narzagaray, who had held this elevated post since 1857. Formerly\r\nGovernor of the island of Porto Rico, in the West Indies, Don Fernando\r\nwas, in consequence of his openly avowed Carlist proclivities, sent into\r\nhonourable exile to the Philippines, and by a lucky chance is at present\r\nonce more invested with the dignity of one of the highest officials of\r\nQueen Isabel II. of Spain. This gentleman received the voyagers of the\r\n_Novara_ with the proverbial lofty courtesy of the Spaniards, yet not\r\nwithout suffering to appear in his address a certain embarrassment and\r\nhesitation, which however may have been due to his not being sufficiently\r\nacquainted with any other tongue than the Spanish, to enable him to use it\r\nin giving fluent expression to his thoughts. The conversation turned\r\nchiefly upon the scene of our latest visit, Java. Notwithstanding the not\r\nvery formidable distance, and the constant communication existing between\r\nthe two islands, the Captain-general seemed to have but a very vague\r\nconception of the political and social condition of Java, and framed his\r\nquestions as though they related to some remote island, in some entirely\r\ndifferent section of the globe, rather than an island in all but immediate\r\nvicinity. As we prepared to return to our vehicles, Don Fernando made use\r\nof the usual unmeaning compliment \"_Usted[87] sabe que mi casa es a la\r\ndisposicion de Usted!_\" (You know you may consider my house as entirely at\r\nyour disposal):[88] it would rather have astonished him though, had his\r\nvisitors taken him at his word!\r\n\r\nPassports, which are absolutely necessary in Manila to make the very\r\nshortest excursion into the interior, are given with the utmost alacrity\r\nto strangers, without any one thenceforward paying the slightest attention\r\nto enabling any expedition to carry out its objects. This cold, utterly\r\nindifferent treatment was doubly felt by travellers fresh from Batavia,\r\nwhere they had been overwhelmed with every sort of attention.\r\n\r\nIn the office of the Captain-general we saw several large sheets of\r\nprinted matter in columns, suspended on the walls, which we presumed were\r\nthe annual statistics of the commerce of the Archipelago, and accordingly\r\nrequested one of the officials to provide us with one. It was only when\r\nunfolding a little later the documents which had been so readily given to\r\nus that we discovered our error, and became aware that these tables\r\nprinted with such care and elegance did not in any way refer to what we\r\nhad supposed, but were the statistics of the various monasteries, and\r\ntheir inhabitant brethren throughout the Philippines. We had far greater\r\ntrouble and difficulty ere we could get at the particulars of the natural\r\nproductions and state of trade of Manila.\r\n\r\nWhen the visitor passes through the St. Domingo gate to the suburb of\r\nBinondo, on the N.E. side of the inner city, we traverse what is called\r\nthe Isthmus, a narrow strip of meadow-land, surrounded by water on both\r\nsides, on which has been erected within these few years a simple monument\r\nin honour of Magelhaens, the discoverer of the Philippines, who, wounded\r\nby a native with a poisoned arrow, breathed his last, 15th April, 1521, on\r\nthe small island of Mactan, lying opposite Cebu. A Doric column of black\r\nmarble, 76 feet high, with inscriptions engraven on the four sides of the\r\npedestal, lifts its head here since 1854,[89] and is altogether a more\r\nappropriate monument than that which the Spaniards erected at Havanna to\r\nthe greatest navigator of any age, Christopher Columbus, to whom they owe\r\nall their after power and greatness, on the spot where his ashes reposed\r\nfor many a long year in the cathedral before they were conveyed back to\r\nSpain. A poor insignificant votive tablet, built into a recess near the\r\naltar, is all that intimates that there once reposed there for a season\r\nthe mortal remains of the man who, to use the words of a German poet,\r\n\"bestowed on the world another world.\"[90]\r\n\r\nOn this isthmus are situated the most delightful pleasure grounds in\r\nManila; the esplanade, with its simple, shady walks, and benches on which\r\nto repose, and further on, nearer the sea on the left bank of the river,\r\nthe \"Calzada\" dam (causeway). Hither every evening comes the gay world of\r\nManila, in long rows of carriages, to be fanned by the delicious cool\r\nsea-breeze. Arrived at the farther extremity of the promenade, the\r\ncoachman, resplendent in gorgeous livery and large shining top-boots, for\r\nhe does not drive from the box but rides postilion, is usually ordered to\r\nstop, and the gentlemen leave the carriage in order to chat with the\r\nladies in the surrounding vehicles, just as we accost our fair friends in\r\nthe theatre, and pay our visits in the boxes. For in Manila there are\r\nneither theatres nor concert-rooms, and the public promenade is therefore\r\nthe only rendezvous of the \"beau monde.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we reached Manila in the height of the rainy season, when\r\neven the attractiveness of nature can only be guessed at by occasional\r\nglimpses, and the delightful outdoor life which enlivens the streets and\r\nthe front porch of the private residences of the inhabitants, is utterly\r\narrested. Here, as in Batavia, the tropical rains fall with a violence of\r\nwhich a native of the northern climates, who has never lived in the\r\ntropics, and knows only the rainfall of his own country, can hardly form\r\nany conception. In July, 1857, it rained here for fourteen days\r\nuninterruptedly, so that the Pasig overflowed its banks, and people were\r\nferried about the streets of Manila, as in the city of Lagoons, by means\r\nof small boats, called here _bancas_. This inundation was converted into a\r\nmerry-making, and visits were paid on all sides in elegant little boats.\r\n\r\nThe one sole amusement with which even the rainy season cannot interfere,\r\nis cock-fighting. So soon as the bad weather has fairly set in, universal\r\nrecourse is had to this, the most popular of amusements, whose cruel,\r\nmurderous issue is strangely in contrast with the mild, soft, timid\r\ncharacter of the natives. These \"_Gallos_,\" as they are called, are a\r\nmonopoly of Government, that is to say, they can only be held with their\r\npermission, and upon payment of a fee for such license. The revenue which\r\nGovernment derives from this anything but civilized amusement is very\r\nconsiderable,[91] and the fee paid by the owners of the cocks and the\r\nspectators is at any rate the least objectionable part of the spectacle,\r\nfor far larger sums are lost in the betting. What cards and hazard are for\r\n_blasee_ Europe, cock-fighting is for the simple native of Manila. Such is\r\ntheir passionate excitement, that several days elapse before their\r\nordinary apathy subsides into its state of chronic contentment. It is\r\nsingular that, with the exception of the Spaniards and the mixed race\r\nfounded by them in various distant parts of the world, there is not now\r\none single civilized nation that can find any pleasure in such brutal\r\namusements as cock-fights and bull-fights.\r\n\r\nThe scene of action is a small building, built of bamboo, and thatched\r\nwith palm-leaves, in the interior of which the benches for the spectators\r\nrise behind each other in form of an amphitheatre, while the arena, or\r\npit, is filled with the owners of cocks and betting-men, until the signal\r\nfor the commencement of the combat is given. Each owner caresses or\r\nincites once more his champion, or to prove his courage flings him against\r\none of the other cocks. At last the spectators have decided to back one or\r\nthe other of the cocks, red or white, the flat comb or the round comb; the\r\nbets are \"on,\" and the \"spur,\" a sharp-pointed weapon above two inches in\r\nlength, and provided with a sheath, is firmly attached to the right foot.\r\nThen the two cocks are simultaneously swung against each other, and a few\r\nfeathers are plucked from their necks to excite their fury. The bell in\r\nthe hand of the director gives the signal for the commencement of the\r\n\"main.\" The spectators retire from the \"pit,\" the sheaths are taken off\r\nthe trenchant spurs, and the encounter commences. Most marvellous is the\r\neagerness for the fray, the dogged valour, which these two knightly\r\nantagonists display to the very last gasp; how even wounded, bleeding, and\r\nsorely fatigued, they will not give up the contest! Occasionally it\r\nhappens that neither of the combatants is hailed the victor. The\r\nextraordinary keen, sharp \"spur\" sometimes wounds both warriors with\r\nterrible severity, till with severed limbs, and bleeding from every pore,\r\nboth lie dead on the field of battle.[92]\r\n\r\nVery comical is the method hit upon in those places of amusements to\r\nsupply the places of the return tickets in use amongst ourselves, and at\r\nthe same time render it impossible for any different person to make use of\r\nthem. When a native wishes to leave the apartment with the intention of\r\nreturning he has his naked fore arm, near the wrist, stamped as he goes\r\nout with a black die, which secures his re-admission, and at the same time\r\nobviates all anxiety as to his losing his return ticket! On his return\r\nthis mark is easily wiped out.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay occurred the \"_Fiestas Reales_,\" or royal fetes, which\r\nwere given by the Colonial Government in honour of the birth of an heir to\r\nthe Spanish throne, Don Alfonso, Prince of the Asturias. The little\r\nheir-apparent had, in fact, seen the light in the month of November\r\npreceding, at Madrid, but when the news reached the Philippines it was\r\nLent; respect for the tenets of the Catholic Church deferred the\r\nfestivities, and afterwards the various fire-works, triumphal arches,\r\nilluminations, &c., took so long a preparation that the month of June and\r\nthe rainy season were again at hand before the fete could be held, which\r\nowing to the latter circumstance fell through, and excited hardly any\r\ninterest. That intelligence should be so many months in arriving at the\r\nPhilippines is due less to their great distance, than to the little care\r\ntaken by Government to promote the public interests. Until 1857, all\r\nletters to Europe were for the most part dispatched by sailing vessels, so\r\nthat letters remained four or five months on the way, and owing to the\r\nuncertainties of the length of passage made by the various vessels, it was\r\nconstantly happening that the last letters sent came to hand before those\r\ndispatched several weeks earlier. This irregularity and uncertainty\r\nweighed so heavily upon commerce, that since March, 1858, there has been\r\nestablished regular communication by steam between Manila and Europe, the\r\nepistolary matter from Europe, for the residents throughout the\r\nArchipelago, being conveyed by a Spanish steamer from Hong-kong, which is\r\ndistant only 600 miles, while all letters for Europe are conveyed to the\r\nlatter port in time for the mails of the 1st and 15th of each month,\r\nwhence they are forwarded together with the English correspondence via\r\nSingapore and Suez.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there is up to this moment no regular communication with\r\nany of the adjacent islands in the Archipelago, even the Government only\r\navailing itself of such sailing vessels as private adventurers may from\r\ntime to time charter. When any change of officials takes place, the new\r\nappointment must often remain vacant for months till the occupant reach\r\nhis post; indeed, during our stay in Manila we witnessed a case in which\r\nthe consort of the Governor of the Marianne Archipelago had been vainly\r\nwaiting for months for an opportunity to return to her husband.[93] Some\r\nforeign merchants settled at Manila had made an offer to the Government,\r\nin consideration of a fixed subsidy, to establish regular communication\r\nbetween the various islands of the Archipelago, and to keep it on foot by\r\nmeans of five steam vessels. But the Colonial Government did not see its\r\nway to giving the company a larger subsidy than 43,000 Spanish piasters\r\n(L6763 at par), and thus the whole plan once more fell through, the\r\ncarrying out of which would so greatly tend to the development of these\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fertility of the islands in all manner of natural\r\nwealth, there are at present but three products of the soil which are\r\nexported in anything like large quantities to the European and North\r\nAmerican markets, and which thus give this group any importance in the\r\neyes of the commercial world, viz. tobacco, Abaca, or Manila hemp, and\r\nsugar. The amount of all other articles exported, such as coffee, indigo,\r\nSapan wood (_Caesalpinia sapan_), straw-plait,[94] hides and skins of\r\nanimals, &c., is proportionately but small. We visited the great\r\nmanufactories of Binondo, as also that of Arroceros, where _cigarillos_,\r\nor paper-covered cigarettes, are exclusively manufactured. The former\r\ngives employment to about 8000 work-people, mostly women. In the long\r\nworkshops, where it is common to see 800 females sitting at work on low\r\nwooden benches in front of a narrow table, there prevails a most\r\ndisagreeable deafening hubbub. Some are busy moistening the leaves, and\r\ncutting off the requisite lengths, or are sorting the fragments and\r\nsmaller pieces, of which inferior cigars will be made; others hold in\r\ntheir right hand a flat smoothed stone, with which they keep continually\r\npounding each single leaf, in order to make these more susceptible of\r\nbeing rolled up. This drumming noise, and the cries of several hundreds of\r\nworkwomen, who, on the appearance of foreign visitors, handle their\r\nimplements of stone with yet more energy, apparently out of sheer\r\nwantonness, the strong odour of the tobacco, and the disagreeable\r\nexhalations from the bodies of so many human beings shut up together in\r\none close apartment, in a tropical temperature, have such an unpleasant,\r\nuncomfortable effect that one hastens to exchange the damp sultry vapours\r\nof the workshops for the fresh air without.\r\n\r\nIn the _Cigarillo_ manufactory about 2000 workmen find employment. Here\r\nalso there is felt in the workshops the same clammy, sultry atmosphere. A\r\nworkman can make about 150 packages of 25 cigarettes, or 3750, per diem,\r\nfor which he is paid four reals[95] (1_s._ 7_d._ English). Most\r\nextraordinary is the rapidity, bordering almost upon the magical, with\r\nwhich the cigarillos are counted, divided into packages, bound up, and\r\nstamped. The unpractised vision of the visitor is hardly able to follow\r\nthe celerity of motion of the workman's hands and fingers.\r\n\r\nBesides the two factories already mentioned, there is yet a third\r\ncigarillo manufactory in Cavite, which employs 4000, and a fourth in\r\nMalabon, employing 5000, workwomen. The quantities annually produced by\r\nthese various manufactories amount to about 1,200,000,000 cigarillos. If\r\nwe deduct the numerous holidays of the Church, on which no work is done,\r\nwe shall find that about 5,000,000 must be made daily. Government buys up\r\neach year from the planters the entire crop of tobacco at a fixed price,\r\nand exports it partly in leaf, but for the most part in cigars, the right\r\nto manufacture which no one possesses but the Government. The monopoly of\r\ntobacco was, after great difficulties had been encountered, first\r\nintroduced into the Philippines in 1787 by Don Jose Basco, the then\r\nGovernor-general.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the cigars are shipped to the East Indies, the islands\r\nof the Malay Archipelago, and North America, only a small quantity in\r\nproportion coming to Europe for sale.\r\n\r\nThe principal tobacco-growing districts of the island of Luzon are Cagayan\r\nand Bisayx, in which on an average 180,000 cwt. of tobacco are grown\r\nannually; of these about 80,000 cwt. are sent annually in the leaf to\r\nSpain, while the surplus are worked up into cigars in Luzon itself, sold\r\nat auction (_al martillo_) every month, and knocked down to the highest\r\nbidder. The average price is 8 to 10 dollars per 1000 _Costados_. There is\r\nbut one species of tobacco grown in Manila, and the size of the leaf is\r\nthe sole element that regulates the value. The Manila tobacco is a very\r\nstrong narcotic; there is, notwithstanding the prevailing opinion in\r\nEurope, no opium mingled with it; one end being simply dipped in rice\r\njuice to glue it together. Indeed, the enormous cost of that liquid drug,\r\nwhich plays so important a part in the history of the Chinese empire,\r\nwould alone prevent its being used. As cigars are greatly in request by\r\nboth sexes in Manila, and it is necessary first to provide for the supply\r\nof the country itself, it occasionally happens that the stocks are not\r\nsufficiently large at once to supply all demands for exportation. Except\r\nduring the public sales by auction, no one is permitted to buy of\r\nGovernment more than 1000 cigars at once, a regulation most vicious in\r\nprinciple and useless in practice, as persons who wish to possess larger\r\nquantities of cigars have simply to send round to any number of persons in\r\nthe tobacco trade, in order to provide themselves with what they require.\r\nWe ourselves experienced how any one, who was desirous of buying 45,000\r\ncigars, sent 45 different individuals to the bonded magazine, from which\r\neach brought 1000 cigars without any further interference.\r\n\r\nAlthough altogether more tobacco is raised on the island of Luzon than in\r\nCuba, yet the exportation from the former is far less in quantity, for the\r\nreason already commented upon, that a large portion of the tobacco so\r\ngrown is consumed in the country itself. Luzon provides 1/10th, and Cuba\r\n1/12th of the entire production of tobacco on the earth, which amounts to\r\n4,000,000 cwt.[96] There are indeed two countries which produce a far\r\nlarger quantity of tobacco than either Luzon or Cuba,[97] but in no other\r\ncountry does the tobacco leaf attain such superior quality, owing to\r\nfavourable climate and congenial soil, as in the Spanish possessions\r\nalready named.\r\n\r\nAnother chief product of the Philippines, which first found its way into\r\nthe markets of the world from these islands, is what is called Manila\r\nhemp. This, however, is not the common hemp plant (_Cannabis sativa_), but\r\nis procured from the fibres of the \"_Musa textilis_,\" a species of\r\nbanana, and is called by the Tagals _abaca_. The plant comes in great\r\nquantities from almost every one of the Philippines, from Luzon to\r\nMindanao, so that the area over which it extends stretches between the\r\nequator and 20 deg. N. This seems, however, to be the most northerly limit of\r\nvegetation of the _Musa textilis_, and consequently it is out of question\r\nto attempt to introduce into Europe the cultivation of this most useful\r\nplant, which, ere it can be profitably grown, requires a temperature of\r\n77 deg. Fahr. The stem of this _musacea_ grows in the Philippines to a height\r\nof from 9 to 12 feet, by about 6 inches in thickness, its leaves being of\r\nan exceedingly dark green colour, 8 feet in length by 1-1/2 feet in width.\r\nThe fruit is smaller, and neither so yellow nor so palatable as that of\r\nthe common banana. To procure the hemp, the trunk, so soon as the fleshy\r\nbulbous fruit makes its appearance, is stripped of its splendid leaves,\r\nwhich serve as fodder for the oxen, and is left about three days to\r\nferment. It is then peeled off in pieces, which by the application of a\r\ncorresponding pressure are drawn between two knives, not too sharp, in\r\norder to separate the hemp, which now begins to be visible, from the bast,\r\nwhich, owing to the fermentation, has become rather brittle. This process\r\nis continued until the hemp is sufficiently cleaned to admit of its being\r\nspread out and dried in the sun. A skilful workman may make extract from 8\r\nto 10 feet of hemp a day. There are 450,000 cwt. of hemp produced\r\nannually, of the value of L520,000, the greater part of which is sent to\r\nthe United States of North America, while from 30,000 to 60,000 cwt. is\r\nmanufactured into rigging for ships in the country itself, at the splendid\r\nfactory of Messrs. Russell and Sturgis, an American firm, by whom it is\r\nexported to Singapore, Australia, and China. This raw material, as well as\r\nthe various products manufactured from it, has a magnificent future\r\nopening to it, and will ere long compete advantageously with English and\r\nRussian hemp in the European markets. The principal objection as yet made\r\nto the use of the Manila hemp for rigging, viz. its contracting in wet\r\nweather, can easily be obviated by more careful treatment of the fibres in\r\nthe process of manufacture. On the other hand, in strength and elasticity\r\nthe abaca surpasses its rival, as has been proved by repeated experiments,\r\nespecially over common European, and even Russian, hemp.[98] Messrs.\r\nRussell and Sturgis have, it is true, monopolized the hemp product of the\r\nentire Archipelago, but under their fostering care it must sensibly\r\nincrease and become perceptibly improved. From the leaves of _Musa\r\ntextilis_, like those of all other species of the banana tribe, very\r\nexcellent paper can be made, and by the increasing cultivation of the\r\n_musaceae_ in the tropics, two main objects could be attained, viz.\r\nproviding a plentiful subsistence for the natives, and extending and\r\ncheapening the medium that mainly contributes to widen the circle of\r\nknowledge of mankind.[99]\r\n\r\nNext to _Musa textilis_, the Rame-shrub (_Boehmeria tenacissima_)\r\nespecially deserves the attention of business men. The fibre of this\r\nmember of the _urticaceae_, which unites extraordinary toughness with much\r\nbeauty and fineness, is stronger and more durable than that of Russian\r\nhemp, and with careful preparation would make into finer thread than the\r\nvery expensive material which is used in Europe at the present day for\r\nmaking the world-famous Brussels point-lace. The variety of purposes to\r\nwhich this useful plant may be applied has hitherto been less fully\r\nrecognized than those of the Manila hemp. In Europe the _Boehmeria\r\ntenacissima_ is but found in botanical gardens, or herbariums, and as yet\r\nnot the slightest use is made of it for industrial purposes. And yet the\r\nintroduction on a large scale of Manila hemp and Rame fibre into the\r\nEuropean markets in place of Russian hemp, would have more than merely a\r\ncommercial and industrial importance![100]\r\n\r\nWe may also notice in this connection another description of fabrics made\r\nfrom fibrous material, which, though but little known beyond the limits of\r\nthe Archipelago, seems to us to deserve to be more extensively known, and,\r\nit would seem, may be most profitably taken up. These are the delicate\r\nalmost transparent tissues prepared from the fibres of one of the\r\n_Bromeliaceae_ (_ananassa sativa_), which are used by the natives for\r\nornamental shirts, _chemisettes_, and necklaces, and are known in commerce\r\nby the names of _Pina_ or grass-cloths.[101] The threads of these textures\r\nare so thin, that they can only be woven in apartments where there is not\r\nthe slightest breath of air. The natives contrive to weave them into the\r\nmost beautiful designs, and were they submitted to some chemical process\r\nwhich should impart to the web a clearer colour, less of a dirty yellow,\r\nthe world of taste would be enriched by the addition of one of the most\r\nexquisite materials that could be presented to adorn the graceful form of\r\nwoman, and while seeming to conceal her charms, would but render them more\r\nconspicuously attractive.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rainy season, during which we visited Manila, was but little\r\ninviting for excursions, we yet could not resist the temptation to make an\r\nexcursion to the celebrated _Laguna de Bay_, a short distance in the\r\ninterior. Mr. J. Steffan, consul for Bremen, a Swiss by birth, and a\r\npartner in one of the most eminent mercantile houses in Manila (Jenny and\r\nCo.), who from the moment the Austrian expeditionaries set foot in the\r\nPhilippines manifested to them the most delightful hospitality, was on\r\nthis occasion also our companion and cicerone. Two other foreigners, an\r\nEnglish artist and a merchant from Amsterdam, joined our party. The\r\nfirst-named had lived for long on the island, and had already visited all\r\nits most accessible spots, whence he had returned with some very accurate\r\nsketches; the latter had been sent out by his firm to Manila, in 1857,\r\nwhen the price of sugar had fallen, for the purpose of purchasing, at the\r\nprice to which he was limited, a large quantity of that important article\r\nof colonial produce. By the time, however, he had reached the capital of\r\nthe Philippines, the value of the sugar had already, in consequence of a\r\nfavourable crop, exceeded the limit assigned him, and has since then\r\nadvanced 300 per cent. Still the Amsterdam agent held on, awaiting a fall,\r\nand meanwhile did his best to wile away his time of exile by feasting his\r\neyes with all the various beauties of the island.\r\n\r\nOn a grey, dreary morning we found ourselves pulling up the Pasig in small\r\ncovered boats, till we reached the Lagune, where a larger craft was\r\nawaiting us, to take the entire company of pilgrims on board and transport\r\nthem to the opposite shore of this inland lake, as far as Los Banos. In\r\nclear sunny weather a row in a _banca_ upon the river Pasig, the aorta of\r\nManila, which forms the communication between the city and the Lagune,\r\ntogether with all the various settlements along the shores of that\r\ninternal sea, must be exceedingly pleasant. The banks of the river,\r\nindeed, are flat and unsightly, but the vegetation rejoices in a\r\nmarvellous profusion of the most beautiful forms and colours. The\r\n_Bambusaceae_ are the chief ornament of the shores, on which there are but\r\nfew palms to be seen, while the banana, the sugar-cane, or the rice-plant\r\nare only exceptionally met with at certain points. The delicate-leaved\r\nbamboo accordingly presents hereabouts an elegance and variety of form,\r\nwhich at first sight seems to mark out its individual representatives as\r\nbelonging to so many different families of plants. Wherever the subjacent\r\nrock is visible along the banks it presents beds of an ashen-grey\r\npumice-stone, which constitutes the chief building material of Manila. On\r\nthe shores of the river, near the city, are situate the various factories\r\nand iron-foundries, above which are the residences of the wealthy\r\nMestizoes and foreign settlers, as also the country-seat of the\r\nGovernor-general, whence, still ascending the stream, are Tagal villages\r\nof wretched cane huts, grouped round stately churches and parsonages,\r\nwhich peep picturesquely through lovely groves of bamboo.\r\n\r\nThere are three modes of boating on the Pasig and through the Lagune,\r\nnamely, the _banca_, consisting of a large trunk of a tree hollowed out\r\nand covered with an awning of bamboo; the _lorcha_ or _falua_ (corruption\r\nof felucca), large, comfortable, but exceedingly clumsy row-boats, which,\r\nparticularly during the rainy season when there is a heavy sea running,\r\nare those chiefly used in this navigation; and finally, the _casco_, which\r\nis of equal breadth at either end, and has more the appearance of a raft.\r\nThe last-named is principally made use of for the transport of heavy\r\nmerchandise, and is in especial favour with the natives, for the reason\r\nthat it is practicable to hoist sail upon it as well as to row. On the\r\nLagune there is also found yet a fourth kind of boat, the Paraho, the\r\nprinciple of which, as well as the name, has obviously been borrowed from\r\nthe Malay _Prahu_, which it closely resembles in form and mode of\r\nsteering.\r\n\r\nOn the Pasig there is a constant and amazing tide of human activity.\r\nNumberless boats pass and repass, some bound for the city, to supply it\r\nwith provisions and other necessary articles, even to drinking-water,\r\nwhich has to be shipped in casks at a considerable distance, others\r\nreturning with all sorts of purchases made in Manila, for the supply of\r\nthe various residents on the shores of the Lagune with the necessaries of\r\nlife. On this voyage we got a sight of numbers of grackles (_Pastor\r\nRosen_), the well-known grasshopper-destroyer, which, about five years\r\nbefore, had been introduced from China at considerable expense, with the\r\nview of extirpating this formidable locust. But since these birds, to kill\r\nwhich is punishable by imprisonment, have become acclimatized, they seem\r\nto have lost all relish for grasshoppers, sitting quiet and unmoved on the\r\ntrees and roofs of the houses, while swarms of locusts are disporting\r\nunder their very eyes. Apparently the number of these destructive insects\r\nis less great in China than in Manila, where these voracious wanderers\r\noften appear in dense swarms, which, in the shape of black clouds,\r\nabsolutely obscure the daylight! Probably, too, their means of sustenance\r\nis much more limited in China than in the Philippines, where these birds,\r\nbeing in fact treated as tame animals, and fairly domesticated, find\r\nfrequent opportunities of satisfying their hunger otherwise.\r\n\r\nAt the village of Patero (from _Pato_, duck), which is situated five miles\r\nfrom the capital on the left bank, the inhabitants are mainly employed in\r\nbreeding ducks. In front of each hut, and near the river, there is a large\r\narea fenced in, where these birds can bask in the sun or bathe at\r\npleasure. The floor of the little poultry house is carefully cleaned every\r\nmorning with river-water, and the ground dug up and plentifully filled\r\ndaily with shell-fish for the use of the ducks, which the natives bring in\r\ntheir small canoes from the sea, where they thrive by millions in the mud.\r\nThe spectacle of the gently-sloping assembling-places of these cackling\r\ndenizens of the watery element, and the clamours with which we were\r\nsaluted, strongly recalled to us the penguins of the Island of St. Paul.\r\nIn Patero millions of ducks are annually reared as articles of trade, as\r\nthe Tagalese look upon the half-hatched eggs and the new-born chickens as\r\nspecial dainties.\r\n\r\nThe natives whom we met on the way all wore large round hats, made of\r\nplaited straw or bamboo, white hose, and above these the invariable shirt,\r\na custom so singular, that it is but very gradually the eye of the\r\nforeigner becomes reconciled to it. The farther we got from the capital\r\nthe more the use of Spanish seemed to diminish, till at the Lagune the\r\nnatives only speak Tagal and Bisay.\r\n\r\nOur original intention had been to row up in _bancas_ as far as the\r\nentrance to the Lagune, where it had been arranged that the _lorcha_,\r\nwhich had started from Manila a day or two before, was to await our\r\narrival. But when little more than half way beyond the village of Pasig we\r\novertook the great clumsy concern, and it was forthwith resolved to remove\r\ninto it bag and baggage, not forgetting the \"provant,\" and endeavour to\r\nmake ourselves as comfortable as we could for a few days and nights.\r\n\r\nAs it was perfectly calm, and the _lorcha_ had to be poled along, we were\r\na considerable time before reaching the entrance to the Lagune, where the\r\nindustrious natives had erected a variety of nets and other fishing\r\napparatus of very peculiar nature. The banks of the Lagune are for some\r\ndistance from the shore thickly studded with thousands of what are called\r\n_corals_, or fish-runs, and a special pilot is required to enable the\r\n_lorcha_ to thread this labyrinth of fishing apparatus of every\r\nconceivable form, so as to reach the open water. Singularly enough, it is\r\nfor the most part the Tagalese women who manipulate the fishing\r\ninstruments, while the men, as we were told, sit in the house and\r\nembroider. Near the entrance is stationed a sort of guardship. A Tagalese\r\noverseer overhauled our passports, turned them over in his hands two or\r\nthree times with much official importance, and then returned them to us.\r\nThe worthy officer of the law was obviously ignorant of the art of\r\nreading, but for that very reason he looked doubly massy, for fear of\r\nexposing his weak side to the Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe Lagune de Bay is a fresh-water lake of such dimensions, that even on\r\na clear day it is impossible, from the entrance, to see the coast on the\r\nfurther side, much less, of course, in the wretched rainy weather which\r\nstuck by us throughout our trip. Nevertheless, it is far inferior in size\r\nto the great lakes of North America. Its greatest breadth is little more\r\nthan 30 miles.[102] All around the fertile shores of this charming lake\r\nnestle little villages, and the daily intercourse with the capital is so\r\nextensive that a steam-boat company would pay well. While on the one hand\r\nthe Colonial Government objects to the expense of entering upon an\r\nundertaking so important for developing the general trade, engineers, on\r\nthe other hand, have for the last 14 years been busily engaged projecting\r\nthe immense work of connecting the Lagune with the ocean by means of a\r\ncanal, in such manner as would enable ships approaching Luzon from the\r\nsouthwards to reach Manila easily, and with great saving in time, instead\r\nof having to sail all round the island. This short cut through the tongue\r\nof land would, it may well be supposed, be in other respects of\r\nincalculable benefit for the country, for the shipping and for trade\r\ngenerally, especially were the execution of this splendid project to be\r\ncarried out hand in hand with a liberal policy, that should shake off that\r\ndespotism which at present weighs like a mountain upon every sort of\r\nintellectual and political activity. Let Manila be declared a free port,\r\nlet the ships of all mercantile nations visit unrestrictedly the various\r\nharbours of the Archipelago, and Spain will under such relaxations reap\r\nfar more profit than from her present retrograde colonial policy, which\r\ncan only result in permanent discontent and impoverishment. A thoroughly\r\nunprejudiced Spanish statesman might make most valuable observations by a\r\nbrief visit to the neighbouring colony of Singapore, that marvellous\r\nBritish settlement, which, owing to a commercial policy conceived in the\r\nfree, liberal spirit that characterizes the 19th century, has sprung up\r\nfrom a nest of pirates into the most flourishing and the wealthiest\r\nemporium in the entire Malay Archipelago. The situation of Manila, as also\r\nits numerous natural advantages and resources, would soon make it a rival\r\nto Singapore. But of what avail are the choicest treasures of nature, if\r\nthe mind be wanting which can turn them to their proper use, and elicit\r\ntheir real value?\r\n\r\nThe continued bad weather compelled us to pass the night most\r\nuncomfortably on board the _lorcha_; however, the morning after our\r\ndeparture from Manila we arrived at the village of Los Banos on the\r\nsouthern shore of the Lagune, where we were most courteously received by\r\nPadre Lorenzo, a Tagalese (only the monks being of Spanish blood, whereas\r\namong the secular clergy there are numbers of coloured persons). The\r\nparsonage, formerly an hospital, is an extensive edifice, with covered\r\nterraces, from whence the visitor enjoys the most splendid views of the\r\nneighbouring hills, as also over the village. Here we were rejoined by\r\nthose members of the Expedition who, there not being room for all on board\r\nthe _lorcha_, had made out the voyage to Los Banos in a small boat. The\r\nGovernment officer of the village of Pasig was so kind as to provide for\r\nour exploration of the lake a well-appointed, thoroughly armed and\r\nequipped war-galley; by no means a superfluous precaution when making an\r\nexcursion upon the lake, as it has not unfrequently happened that\r\nunprotected strangers have returned to Manila robbed of everything.\r\n\r\nWe had great difficulty in making our kind Father Lorenzo, whose\r\nwanderings had been rather limited, comprehend from what country we came,\r\nand to what nation we belonged. The natives of Luzon for the most part\r\nbelieve that all mankind consists of but two nations, Spaniards and\r\nEnglish; the former they regard as their own masters, while the political\r\nand commercial power of the latter impress them with more terror than\r\nsympathy, and this feeling is still further deepened by that spiritual\r\nteaching, which makes everything seem to their untutored minds of the most\r\nterrible criminality, which does not strictly accord with Roman\r\nCatholicism.\r\n\r\nLos Banos (the baths), so named on account of the numerous hot springs,\r\nwhose source is close at hand at the foot of the now extinct volcanic cone\r\nof Maquilui, thickly wooded to its very summit, was so far back as the end\r\nof the 16th century a place of resort for invalids, who hoped here to find\r\na cure for their various maladies. In the interests of suffering\r\nhumanity, the Franciscans of those days, then in the height of their\r\ninfluence, built over the baths a sort of hut, and a hospital dedicated to\r\n\"_Nuestra Senora de las Aguas santas de Maynit_\" (our Lady of the Holy\r\nwaters of Maynit, the latter name expressing _hot_ in Tagal). Although at\r\npresent in a very forlorn and dilapidated condition, there is still in\r\nexistence, quite near to the edge of the Lake, an apartment enclosed\r\nwithin a wall, within which there boils up from a considerable depth a\r\nspring of hot water of a temperature of 186 deg.8 Fahr.; which is\r\noccasionally used, both by natives and foreigners, as a vapour bath,\r\nalthough these _Thermae_ are more used to scald poultry than for their\r\noriginal purpose of curing disease. The entire neighbourhood is volcanic.\r\nBehind Maquilui, which is about 3400 feet high, lies, surrounded by a deep\r\nlake, the active crater of the renowned volcano of Taal, while to one side\r\nof the first-named mountain rises in the blue distance, to a height of\r\nfrom 6000 to 7000 feet, the gigantic mass of the Majayjay[103] range, a\r\nvolcanic system long since extinct. An oppressive sultriness in the\r\natmosphere, such as we had never before experienced, and a drenching\r\nthunder-storm, put a complete stopper on our projected excursion to make a\r\ncloser acquaintance with the hills. Somewhat of the terrific heat\r\nexperienced here, may, with much justice, be attributed to the great\r\nnumber of almost boiling springs which issue from the foot of the\r\nMaquilui, so that even on entirely clear days, when the mountain-top is\r\nquite free of clouds, the country about Los Banos seems enveloped in an\r\natmosphere of mist.\r\n\r\nThe main object and ever-memorable result of our excursion was the _Laguna\r\nEncantada_ (or Enchanted Lake,--the _Socol_ of the Tagalese), distant not\r\nmuch more than a mile from Los Banos. Volcanic agency and tropical beauty\r\nhave combined to prepare here one of the most singular and mysterious\r\nphenomena that the eye of man may ever behold. Although this small lake is\r\nonly separated by a low hill from the larger basin, yet the approach to it\r\nis extremely troublesome and arduous. It is necessary here and there to\r\nuse one's hands, in order to creep through the brushwood along the steep\r\nwall of rock, till the shore of the lake is at last reached. Even the very\r\n\"dug-outs,\" in which the lake is to be navigated, have to be transported\r\nover this lonely inhospitable hill. As the Lagune enjoys the unenviable\r\nreputation of being the haunt of numbers of ravenous crocodiles, which\r\nhave on several occasions overturned the light canoes navigating it at the\r\ntime, and without further ceremony devoured their crews, the natives had\r\nlearned to take the precaution of binding two or three canoes close\r\ntogether with bamboos and cords, in order to diminish the risk of being\r\noverturned while boating on this dreary haunt of \"caymano.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the natives were getting ready this handsome specimen of a craft, we\r\nstood on the shore, every one absorbed in gazing at this singular natural\r\npicture. Calm and mysterious-looking the lake lay before us, a circular\r\nbasin, of a deep green from innumerable almost microscopic water plants,\r\nunfathomable, if we may trust common report, and enclosed by a crater-like\r\nwall of lava-blocks. All along the shore grew the tropical forest;\r\ngigantic primeval trunks, wildly festooned with wondrously luxuriant\r\ncreepers, raised their towering crests, their splendid coronets of leaves\r\nreflected in the calm mirror below, and casting the lake in every corner\r\ninto a dusky, shadowy obscurity of outline. From the topmost branches of\r\nthe trees were suspended huge brown, indistinct-looking fruits. There was\r\ndeath-like silence all around. Only at fitful intervals might be\r\ndistinguished the note of a bird, or the muttered growl of distant\r\nthunder. We now got into our canoes and rowed silently over the waters of\r\nthe lake. As though to add to the interest of the adventure, it came on to\r\nrain pretty heavily. Some of the party followed the very practical custom\r\nof the natives, who forthwith divested themselves of their clothing, and\r\nleft the rain to beat upon their naked bodies, while they put their\r\ndresses under the seats of the boat to prevent their being soaked.\r\nFortunately the alligators at no time made their appearance in such\r\nnumbers as the tales of the natives had led us to anticipate. We saw but\r\none of these monsters, apparently about 15 feet long, who however speedily\r\ndived out of our sight.[104] Our guides maintained it would be advisable\r\nto take a dog with us, whose howl would have aroused the alligators and\r\nbrought them up to the surface in hope as of prey. Indeed people\r\nfrequently sacrifice dogs in order to entice these rapacious monsters from\r\ntheir haunts for the purpose of hunting them.\r\n\r\nIf however disappointed in this spectacle, we were recompensed by another\r\nnot less peculiar. For hardly had a shot been fired at one of the\r\nwater-fowls which were skimming to and fro over the lake, than at once\r\ntree and thicket seemed filled with life. Birds of all kinds, screaming\r\nand whirring, fluttered about or dashed wildly against each other on every\r\nside. Thousands that had been sitting on the beach concealed in the deep\r\nshade, wood-pigeons and legions of gigantic bats, which had been suddenly\r\nfrightened out of their listless repose, now flew about directly before\r\nthe murderous fowling-pieces. The singular-looking fruits which seemed to\r\nbe so strangely dependent from the trees, were transformed into Kalong\r\nbats (_Pteropus edulis_), and flew about in immense flocks that obscured\r\nthe light of day, directly over our heads, hastily seeking a shelter in\r\nthe forest, which should hide them from the gaze of the sportsmen.\r\nProbably we should have brought down some of these singular animals, had\r\nnot our fowling-pieces, owing to the incessant pour of rain, got so\r\nthoroughly out of order that we had to content ourselves with getting a\r\nvery few specimens for our zoological collection.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the parsonage from this interesting excursion, we found\r\nthe _Alcalde Mayor_, who had come to Los Banos from the adjacent small\r\ntown of Santa Cruz, to welcome the foreigners, and be of service to them.\r\nThe _Alcalde Mayor_, or _Gobernador_, is the highest official, the chief\r\nboth of administration and justice in the province, a sort of prefect,\r\nunder whom are the _Gobernadorcillos_, or departmental administrators,\r\nbeneath whom again the Cabezas,[105] or parish justices, form yet a lower\r\ngrade. The chief duties of these native officials consist in seeing that\r\nthe proper amount of tribute or head-money is duly collected. This impost\r\nis divided into three parts: the duty for defraying the State expenses\r\namounting to five reals, that for supporting the Church amounts to three\r\nreals, and that for the wants of the community amounting to one real, so\r\nthat the whole taxation levied upon each individual liable is about nine\r\nreals (4_s._ 9_d._ English). In addition to the natives, the Chinese\r\nresident in Manila and the half-breed Chinese are subject to a poll-tax,\r\nthe pure Chinese being rated according to their social position and the\r\nnature of their calling. They pay on the average about 17 dollars, or\r\nabout 15 times as much as the native. The poll-tax of the Chinese Mestizo\r\namounts to 18 reals, or about twice as much as that on the native. All\r\nmales are liable to be rated for the poll-tax, as also all females when\r\nmarried, or when they have attained the age of 25. Those exempted from\r\nthe poll-tax are all Spaniards and their half-caste children, all foreign\r\nresidents except the Chinese, as also all natives above 60, and a few\r\nnative families, whose ancestors had performed certain services for the\r\nSpaniards at the period of the conquest; and, lastly, all native\r\nauthorities during their tenure of office (usually six years).[106]\r\n\r\nThe morning after our excursion to the Enchanted Lake, a hunt of\r\nwater-fowl was organized among the swamps surrounding Calamba, which\r\nfurnished us with plenty of sport, as well as important scientific\r\nresults, in which it would have been yet more productive, had it not been\r\nsuddenly brought to a close by the acute illness of one of the canoe-men.\r\nAs some cases of cholera had occurred during the few days immediately\r\npreceding, it seemed to be only a wise precaution to exercise some little\r\nprudence on the present occasion. Strange to say, however, the man\r\nattacked, despite his sickness, rowed resolutely till the party reached\r\nLos Banos, during all which period he showed the most lively interest in\r\nthe hunt, constantly calling our attention to birds which his keen eye\r\ndetected at a distance, or which were moving softly over the water without\r\nbeing observed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one of the zoologists was busy at the parsonage, making\r\npreparations of the most interesting specimens procured. Padre Lorenzo\r\ncould hardly believe his eyes when he beheld the naturalist engaged in\r\nsuch a bloody business, apparently on precisely the most agreeable spot of\r\nthe whole terrace, and performing the various dissections requisite upon\r\nthe dead bodies of some couple of dozen of birds. In whatever direction\r\none turned in the apartment, the eye encountered nothing but birds of\r\nvariegated plumage, gigantic Kalong bats, monkeys, or else barrels filled\r\nwith spirits of wine, in which were preserved snakes, fish, and other\r\nsmall inhabitants of the deep. The poor padre, accustomed to peaceful\r\nmeditation and full of simplicity, appeared quite convinced he must have\r\nsinned grievously that such a visitation should have overtaken him, as\r\nthat this horde of foreigners should have disturbed the repose of his\r\npeaceful asylum with such appalling practices. The youths of the village,\r\nencouraged by the promise of remuneration, busied themselves with yet\r\nfurther increasing our zoological collection, and made their appearance,\r\nbreathless with running, each with some still more curious and important\r\nobject to show to the strange gentleman, who found such interest in snakes\r\nand insects, that he even paid money down for them!\r\n\r\nPadre Lorenzo, however, was ere long rid of his singular guests, with whom\r\nhe could even not get upon an intelligible footing. On the same day on\r\nwhich the hunt among the swamps of Calamba took place in the morning, the\r\nExpeditionary party returned from Los Banos, and by way of recompense to\r\nthe obliging padre for the discomfort inflicted, they presented him with\r\nsome provisions and some bottles of claret, which filled the worthy\r\ngentleman with delight, and seemed completely to reconcile him to the\r\n\"Estranjeros.\" Some of the members of our Expedition also visited the two\r\nvillages of Jalla-jalla and Binangonan, lying close to the shore of the\r\nlake, places of great interest in a geographical sense, while the\r\nremainder of the party returned to Manila in the same way they had come.\r\nUnfortunately throughout the entire distance the rain fell worse than\r\never. It never ceased pouring in deluges, so that for hours together we\r\ncould not get upon deck, but had to remain below in the small bleak,\r\ncomfortless cabin. Here there was nothing for it but to wile away the time\r\nas best we might. We talked \"_de omnibus rebus, et quibusdam aliis_,\" we\r\nlaughed, we sang, and we--SMOKED, a habit, be it remarked incidentally, so\r\nconstant and universal here, that the _Pebete_ with its glowing top is\r\nconstantly circulating from hand to hand. This is a sort of tinder in the\r\nshape of small thin rods, a cubit long, which is prepared in China from a\r\nmixture of fine dried sawdust, fir, and clay, and forms a by no means\r\ninsignificant article of commerce, the greater part coming from\r\nMacao.[107] A chest of eight cubic feet, filled with _Pebete_ or\r\n\"joss-sticks,\" as the English call this tinder, the use of which pervades\r\nthe entire Malay Archipelago as far as Madras, costs from 10_s._ to 16_s._\r\n6_d._ sterling.\r\n\r\nBy 11 P.M. we had got back to Manila. The weather had cleared up somewhat,\r\nthe rain had ceased, and the city and environs were gay with the gleam of\r\ninnumerable variegated lamps, intended to represent the illuminations\r\nexpressive of the joy of the people at the birth of a prince of the\r\nAsturias. This did not however continue long; the enthusiasm that was\r\nfinding vent through the glitter of the lamps was drowned in another\r\ndeluge of rain, and as the exhibition had now lasted for several nights in\r\nsuccession, people at last had got weary of the trouble of constantly\r\nrelighting them; the gaudy triumphal arches were decomposed into their\r\nconstituent atoms--rough boards, wooden pegs, nails, and filthy little\r\noil-lamps.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of the wet weather put more distant excursions out of the\r\nquestion. We had to content ourselves with having seen all that was really\r\nworth seeing in the city and environs during our limited stay.\r\n\r\nMany additional visits were paid to the interior of the city, to the fort,\r\nto the monasteries, and the various public institutions. Of these latter,\r\ntwo call for a more particular notice: the \"_Biblioteca Militar_,\" and the\r\nimmense hospital of San Juan de Dios, under the charge of the Charitable\r\nFriars.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of the Military Library, which is situated in one portion\r\nof the cloister of the Jesuits which had been almost entirely\r\ndestroyed[108] by a former earthquake, consisted far less in its\r\nbibliographic treasures, than in a small collection of objects\r\nillustrative of natural history, of which the first beginning had been\r\nmade but a few months before our arrival. It deserves the more notice that\r\nit was not the project of a professed naturalist, but solely of an\r\n\"aficimado,\" or friend to scientific inquiry, Colonel Miguel Creus.\r\nAlthough very deficient, still the bare experiment has paved the way to a\r\nbetter and more complete collection, which at present comprises, besides\r\nabout 100 species of birds and a few mammalia, a number of objects\r\nillustrative of ethnography, geological specimens, and the various\r\nmanufactures and natural products of the Archipelago (among which are 37\r\nspecies of rice). Considering the natural resources of this Archipelago,\r\n(some of which, especially the Conchylia,[109] far surpass in richness of\r\ncolour, beauty, and gracefulness of form anything that has yet been met\r\nwith in any part of the globe,) the inauguration of this small collection\r\nmay yet prove the foundation of one of the most magnificent and marvellous\r\nmuseums of natural history, provided the laudable intention of the\r\nfounder receive adequate support; and the work, commenced as a labour of\r\nlove, be continued and promoted with energy and perseverance.[110]\r\n\r\nThe great Civil Hospital, to which Dr. Fullerton, a Scotchman settled in\r\nManila, was so kind as to accompany us, is a very extensive range of\r\nbuildings, with large airy rooms, but so unclean and ill-kept, that it is\r\nno wonder if the report be true, that many natives in bad health prefer to\r\nrun the chance of death without, to being brought to this infirmary.\r\nIndeed most of the rooms are empty and unoccupied, there being in the\r\nwhole building but 30 confined to their beds, which in a city of not less\r\nthan 130,000 souls, with but _one_ hospital, is at all events a remarkable\r\nphenomenon. Every year on St. John's day the brethren of the order give a\r\nfete, when all the different rooms are scoured, swept, and garnished, and\r\nthe sick in the hospital are present at the festivities, and, unrestricted\r\nby considerations of diet, are regaled with food and wine to their heart's\r\ncontent. This is likewise the period at which the hospital is most\r\nextensively patronized, and not only by those actually sick, but far more\r\nby those who qualify for a residence in the hospital by a too great\r\ndevotion to the plentiful viands provided on St. John's day. When the\r\nEnglish were in possession of Manila during the Seven Years' War, this\r\nrange of buildings was used as a barrack, for which reason the church was\r\nconsidered as desecrated for 90 years, and only in 1857 consecrated once\r\nmore as a temple of God.\r\n\r\nThere is also in the _Calle de Hospicio_ a Military Hospital, somewhat\r\nbetter kept, and not like the former under the charge of a brotherhood,\r\nbut of a medical staff. Unfortunately the arrangements here leave very\r\nmuch to be desired. The rooms, insufficiently ventilated, are in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the kitchen, the smoke and odours from which cannot\r\nbut be very prejudicial to the patients. In the various wards there were\r\nabout 150 to 200 sick, whose lot called for redoubled sympathy,\r\nconsidering the little attention paid them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no opportunity presented itself during our stay at Manila of\r\nwitnessing any of those processions of the Church, which are necessarily\r\nso frequent in the course of the year. This was the more to be regretted,\r\nas we were told of many peculiarities of these costly processions. Here\r\napparently, as in the earlier dependencies of Spain, in Central and\r\nSouthern America, the Roman Catholic ritual has become mingled in the most\r\nextraordinary manner with ceremonies borrowed from paganism. The earliest\r\nSpanish missionaries were especially prone to believe that by retaining\r\nsome of the former ceremonies they would facilitate the work of\r\nconversion, and increase the number of neophytes. They saw no scandal in\r\nthe native, attired sometimes as a giant twelve feet high, sometimes as a\r\nMalay warrior, sometimes as an aboriginal savage, fantastically painted,\r\nand accoutred with bow and arrow, in a word, in all sorts of masquerading\r\ncostume, frolicking in the very midst of the sacred procession, and\r\nperforming all manner of buffoonery in front of the life-sized and\r\ngaily-adorned images of saints; but appeared rather to contemplate with\r\npleasure that these wild beings, who had resisted the Spaniards on their\r\nfirst arrival on the island, were now subjected to the Holy Church, and\r\nrejoiced in her service! There are also numbers of natives dressed up as\r\nanimals, and girls gaily decorated with flowers and in robes of spotless\r\nwhite, as also a fantastically-attired jester, who from time to time gives\r\nnational dances and sings national songs, to the best of his ability, all\r\nin one long procession, accompanied by monks singing chorals and carrying\r\nwax tapers, while a promiscuous crowd of the faithful bring up the rear.\r\n\r\nThe sight of such processions have anything but an edifying influence upon\r\na European, but on the mind of the masses they seem to make a deep\r\nimpression, and for weeks after, when smoking a cigarette in the privacy\r\nof the family circle, they will talk of the splendour of such solemnities,\r\nand the motley episodes that accompanied it. If it were admissible to\r\njudge of the religious mind of a people by their outward observances, the\r\nTagalese would be the most devout race in the world. Wherever the natives\r\ncome in contact with the Church, they put on an extraordinary stern and\r\nreverential deportment, and even in the most trivial matters the great\r\ninfluence of the priesthood upon the masses becomes abundantly apparent.\r\nThis is the most conspicuous every evening as the clock tolls for the Ave\r\nMaria. The tones work like enchantment upon the people at whatever\r\ndistance they may be audible, and for a few moments a profound silence\r\nsucceeds to the noise and bustle. The labourer and the promenader, the\r\nladies and gentlemen of the upper ranks in their elegant carriages, as\r\nwell as the poor Tagale returning homeward from his hard day's work, and\r\ndriving his laden mule before him, are for the space of an instant awed by\r\nthe solemn sounds. All vehicles stop suddenly short, the gentlemen and\r\nservants uncover their heads, the restless masses stand as though nailed\r\nto the ground, and then sink gradually on their knees in prayer, their\r\nheads bared and their cigars extinguished; no one would venture to break\r\nin upon the universal stillness so long as the bell continues to toll. But\r\nas soon as it is silent, each jumps to his feet, and proceeds on again,\r\nbelieving he may now in safety give way to his frolicsomeness and pursue\r\nhis pleasures.\r\n\r\nLife in Manila during the dry season was described to us as exceedingly\r\nagreeable and gay. Then almost every evening joyous groups thread the city\r\nsinging and joking, while from every hut resounds some snatch of melody\r\naccompanied by the guitar. We had a slight foretaste of the joviality\r\nwhich must prevail in Manila during the delicious summer evenings from the\r\njoyous disposition manifested by the various Tagal families, even during\r\nthe wet season, when the almost incessant rain, and the swampy state of\r\nthe streets, compelled the natives to remain crowded in the narrow rooms\r\nof their poor little huts. In St. Miguel, a hamlet in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Manila, with a number of country-seats of wealthy\r\nforeigners and natives, we repeatedly heard the sweet plaintive notes of\r\nthe native women singing Tagal ditties, which for pathos and thrilling\r\ntenderness surpassed all we had hitherto heard or read of the talents of\r\nthe coloured races for song and melody. We shall be able in the Appendix\r\nto give the notes of a very characteristic melody, the words of which form\r\na very favourite popular song (Condiman), which we ultimately succeeded in\r\ntaking down through the kindness of Senor Balthasar Girandier of Manila.\r\n\r\nIt was at San Miguel that we had not alone the most agreeable, but also\r\nthe most melancholy, experience of our entire stay in the capital of the\r\nPhilippines. On an island opposite the handsome, beautifully situate\r\nresidence of our hospitable friend Mr. Steffan, the Bremen Consul, is the\r\nPoorhouse, in which the insane as well as the sick are confined together,\r\nthe whole being, like all the other humane institutions of Manila, under\r\nthe superintendence of an ecclesiastic, in the present case a Mestizo. It\r\nappeared there was no proper or regular medical attendance. Without\r\nassistance, or any one responsible for their proper care, these miserable\r\nbeings, left in an indescribably desolate and neglected condition, cower\r\ndown upon the bare stone floor in the damp, filthy rooms, staring vacantly\r\nbefore them, or slink about among the cool corridors, murmuring\r\nunintelligibly to themselves. The padre, habituated to such a state of\r\nmatters, seems never to give it a moment's thought, but rather to make it\r\nhis amusement to conduct strangers through the dismal, horrible wards,\r\nwhere at each step one encounters some fresh form of misery. We felt most\r\npity at the sight of a female, whose features and whole appearance spoke\r\nof a happier lot in by-gone days. It seemed a mystery crying aloud for\r\nreparation, that this unhappy being, an orphan, worthy of all compassion,\r\nshould for a slight attack of melancholy be liable to be sent to the\r\nasylum for the insane by her unscrupulous relations, that they might with\r\nthe greater security possess themselves of her property. So deep and so\r\npermanent was the impression made by this melancholy spectacle, that even\r\nnow, after the lapse of years of varied experience, since our visit to the\r\nlunatic asylum of Manila, the ill-fated being, with her wan yet striking\r\nfeatures, her large, melancholy black eyes, and her wavy, shining black\r\nhair, her dress neglected and half torn into pieces, stands out life-like\r\nbefore us, as an embodiment of misery.\r\n\r\nEarly on the day on which we bade adieu to Manila we found an opportunity\r\nof seeing a live boa-constrictor, said to be 48 feet long and seven\r\ninches thick, at the house of a secular ecclesiastic in the suburb of\r\nSanta Cruz. This gigantic reptile had been confined for 32 years in a\r\nlarge wooden cage, where it had enjoyed such a carefully tended existence\r\nthat it had fairly outlived the good padre, and was now for sale by his\r\nheirs. The indolent animal, constantly lying almost motionless among the\r\nsand, is fed only once in every four weeks, when it is usually presented\r\nwith a young pig.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June the members of our Expedition went on board the small\r\nsteamer plying to Cavite, where lay the frigate, on board which all\r\nnecessary preparations had been made. Now, on the eve of departure, almost\r\nevery one of our number mourned the disappointment of cherished\r\nexpectations. The inclemency of the weather had not alone precluded our\r\nundertaking the more distant excursions which would have repaid our\r\nresearches in the natural history of the islands, but had even interposed\r\nserious obstacles to our wanderings in the immediate neighbourhood;\r\nmoreover, up to the very moment of our departure the Government manifested\r\nthe utmost indifference to the objects of the Expedition, while even the\r\neducated portion of the Spanish residents never took the slightest notice.\r\nThe more reason therefore is it, under such circumstances, that we should\r\nnot be unmindful of the few, such as Messrs. Steffan, Schmidt, Wegener,\r\nWood, Fullerton, Fonseca, Girandier, and Creus, who, with warm interest in\r\nour plans, furnished us with new material relating to the Philippines and\r\ntheir inhabitants, and left us with the agreeable prospect of a permanent\r\nexchange of literary and scientific labours.\r\n\r\nAt one A.M. of the 25th June we weighed anchor in the harbour of Cavite,\r\non our voyage to the Empire of China. The land breeze, which sets in\r\nregularly every night, carried us clear out of the Bay of Manila, but in\r\nthe open sea outside we found, contrary to expectation, instead of the\r\nS.W. monsoon, light variable winds and calms, which materially interfered\r\nwith our progress. At last, when we were about mid-way across the China\r\nSea, we fell in with the long-looked for S.W. wind, which speedily wafted\r\nus to the next station we were to visit, the British colony of Hong-kong,\r\nor Victoria. With favourable winds the voyage from Manila to Hong-kong, a\r\ndistance of about 700 nautical miles, is four or five days' sail; owing to\r\nthe constant contrary winds we were double that time.\r\n\r\nAlready, before we came in sight of land, a Chinese fishing vessel had put\r\na pilot on board in the shape of a long-tailed son of the Celestial\r\nEmpire, who jabbered English in a fashion to set the hair on end, and was\r\nlost in wonder at our flag, which he had never before seen. We afterwards\r\nfound that the dialect used by our pilot was what is called\r\nCanton-English, such as is spoken by all Chinese who have dealings with\r\nthe British, and consisting exclusively of a most ludicrous distortion of\r\nthe commonest English phrases.\r\n\r\nAbout noon on the 4th July we sighted the Chinese coast; and before\r\nsundown we had passed the Lemmas islands, and found ourselves in the\r\nisland-studded, many-bayed archipelago at the mouth of the Canton River,\r\nwhere the English have selected Hong-kong, with its admirable harbour, for\r\nthe site of their colony. Thousands of fishing-boats covered the surface\r\nof the ocean all around us, always sailing parallel with each other, in\r\nfact, quite a fleet of fishermen, who, on a favourable opportunity, add a\r\nlittle buccaneering, and have numerous secure retreats among the thousands\r\nof coves all around, so that even up to the present day they can carry on\r\nalmost unpunished their piratical attempts upon their own\r\nfellow-countrymen, as well as upon foreigners ignorant of their danger. It\r\nwas the first time we had seen in any numbers the Chinese Junk, with its\r\nstrange-looking rigging. On most of these small but clumsy vessels there\r\nwas cut or painted on either side of the forecastle a huge eye, as though\r\nthe crew were anxious to increase the power of vision of their vessel, so\r\nthat it might more readily pick its way through the numerous dangerous\r\nreefs and coral banks. On the other hand the superstitious sea-faring\r\nChinese sometimes veil and cover up the eyes of their vessels, in order\r\nthat they should not behold certain strange things passing by, as, for\r\ninstance, a dead body, or an approaching thunder-storm, and not be\r\nfrightened by them.[111]\r\n\r\nThe nearer we approached the coast, the more was our gaze rivetted by a\r\nlandscape of the most imposing character, and now not owing to the\r\naltitude of the hills (for the highest peak is only 3000 feet), but to the\r\ngrandeur of their form and their contour. Here are sharp, needle-shaped\r\npinnacles, their steep rocky cones reminding one of the Sugar Loaf at Rio,\r\nand then round shoulders of hills, and far-extending ranges, penetrated by\r\ndeep defiles, all nearly perpendicular, and without any extent of level\r\nland, and rising sheer out of the sea. These mountain ranges are almost\r\nentirely naked, or covered only with a scanty grass or bush vegetation: no\r\ntree, no forest hides the majestic groups of rocks and stones, and when\r\nthe setting sun picked out with dark, well-defined shadows the sharp\r\noutline of the granite rock, it was as though there lay before us a \"bit\"\r\nof the Swiss Alps, bathed in the sea as far as the limit of\r\nforest-vegetation, and our sailors contemplated with redoubled enjoyment a\r\nscene which reminded them of their native Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nAs the night was dark, with neither moonlight nor light-house (of which\r\nlatter there is unfortunately an utter lack here), we could not venture to\r\nwind our way through the narrow channel into the harbour of Hong-kong, on\r\nthe north side of the island, and we anchored therefore about 9 P.M. on\r\nthe west side, in the Lemmas Channel; and with the first beams of the sun,\r\non the morning of the 5th July, we stood in to the enchanting harbour of\r\nHong-kong. Where the previous day we could descry from seaward hardly any\r\ntraces of human activity in the hills and rocks along the coast, so that\r\nthe land seemed desolate and deserted, there now smiled upon us, as we\r\ndoubled Green Island, the city of Victoria, rising amphitheatre-like; and,\r\nlying invitingly before us, its harbour, all alive with numbers of stately\r\nships and steamers, looking like an inland lake,--in fact, entirely\r\nland-locked. Several old ships of the line, which the English use as\r\nhospitals and coal depots, filled the background, among which was the\r\nRoyal Charlotte, 130 guns, the first three-decker that has passed the\r\nEquator.\r\n\r\nAt 10 A.M. we cast anchor directly opposite the town; and amid the flags\r\nof England, America, France, Holland, and Russia, there now flaunted\r\nproudly forth the flag of Austria!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] In Manila the minimum annual rainfall is 84 inches, the maximum 102\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[73] The expedition sailed from Madras with about 2300 men; the squadron\r\nconsisted of 13 ships of war and transports. The English landed without\r\nany opposition, laid siege to Manila, stormed and captured the city proper\r\nwithin ten days after their arrival. The Citadel capitulated; the\r\nGovernor, an Archbishop, binding himself to pay a contribution of\r\n4,000,000 dollars (L833,000), in order to save the city from being sacked.\r\nThis expedition was always looked on by the Spaniards of the Philippines\r\nas a very rash adventure, which by no means tended to diminish the\r\nnational antipathy to the English race, although after such freebooting\r\nexpeditions as have within these last two years been witnessed on the part\r\nof civilized states in law-abiding Europe, this invasion by an army of\r\ndeclared enemies must be viewed in an entirely different light.\r\n\r\n[74] Spanish writers, treating of the Philippines, derive this name from\r\n\"Losong,\" which in the native language means the wooden mortar in which\r\nthe rice, which forms the chief subsistence of the inhabitants, is shelled\r\nand pounded. The first strangers who came to this island, and found in\r\nevery hut one of these very peculiar clumsy-looking implements, spoke of\r\nthe newly discovered island as \"Isle de los Losenes\" (island of wooden\r\nmortars), whence in process of time it became transformed into Luzon.\r\n\r\n[75] One of these hotels, the Hotel Francais, was, at the time of our\r\nvisit, kept by a Frenchman named Dubosse, a man of a most adventurous\r\ndisposition, who afterwards accompanied the French army to China as a\r\nmess-man, and was one of the victims seized by Sang-ko-lin-sin's soldiers,\r\nnear Pekin, in September, 1860, who met with such a horrible fate. The\r\nother inn, the Hotel Fernando, kept by a North American, is yet more\r\nfilthy and noisy than the first-named, since, being situated on the\r\nharbour, it serves for a rendezvous for the various ships' captains. In\r\nneither of these is the charge less than 4 to 5 Spanish dollars a day, or\r\nabout L1 sterling.\r\n\r\n[76] The Stranger's Guide to the Philippines (_Guia de Forasteros_) for\r\nthe year 1859 gives the names of 61 commercial houses established by\r\nSpaniards in Manila. Besides these, there are in the capital of the\r\nPhilippines, seven English, three North American, two French, one German,\r\nand two Swiss trading firms.\r\n\r\n[77] We borrow this alphabet from the valuable work of Baron von Huegel,\r\nentitled the Pacific Ocean and the Spanish Colonies of the Indian\r\nArchipelago (Vienna, printed at the Imperial Press, 1860), and believe the\r\nreader will the more gratefully welcome it that only a small number of\r\ncopies of Baron von Huegel's interesting journal were printed in manuscript\r\nfor private circulation.\r\n\r\n[78] This opinion of our Augustinian guide is not shared out there. An\r\nAustrian traveller, as widely renowned as highly cultivated, Baron Von\r\nHuegel, relates, in his Diary already alluded to, the following singular\r\nrevelations by a friar in Manila: \"The Philippine Islands belong to the\r\nAugustine monks; in Manila, Don Pasquale (the then Governor) or another\r\nmay ruffle it and talk large,--in the interior we are the true masters.\r\nTell me where you want to go and everything shall be laid open for you!...\r\nPolice in the interior? It is laughable to hear of such an idea! As if\r\nsuch were possible! and I should be glad to make the acquaintance of that\r\nofficial who would venture to ask even the simple question of who any man\r\nis, who is under the protection of our order!... Should you like to ascend\r\nthe Majayjay, the highest hill in the interior? An Augustinian friar shall\r\naccompany you thither. Should you care to make an excursion to the Lagoons\r\nand thence proceed to the Pacific Ocean? An Augustinian friar shall be\r\nyour guide. Have you a hankering to visit the forests of Ilocos, northward\r\nfrom Manila, or to sail down the great river Lanatin? An Augustinian shall\r\narrange all that for you. In one word, say what you wish to do!\"\r\n\r\n[79] Fray Manuel Blanco, whose portrait, the size of life, but by no means\r\nartistically executed, adorns one of the corridors, was born 24th\r\nNovember, 1778, at Navianos, in the province of Zamora in Spain, and died\r\nin the convent of Manila 1st April, 1845.\r\n\r\n[80] Of these there were in 1857, 373,569 liable to taxation. Within the\r\nsame year there were 85,629 persons baptized, 16,768 married, and 49,999\r\nburied with the rites of the Church.\r\n\r\n[81] In 1857 there were baptized in these 76 villages 21,604 children,\r\n4512 couples were united in wedlock, and 12,002 were buried.\r\n\r\n[82] In the entire Archipelago there is but _one_ newspaper, \"El Boletin\r\nOficial,\" published under the auspices of Government, and which treats\r\nmuch more of religious than of political topics. There are but two\r\nprinting and publishing houses in Manila, one of which is in the hands of\r\nthe Dominicans, and prints almost exclusively Prayer-books and religious\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[83] This historical poem is entitled \"_Luzonia, o sea Los Genios del\r\nPasig_.\"\r\n\r\n[84] Of this number of souls there were in 1857, 188,509 amenable to\r\ntaxation, while during the year there occurred 31,285 births, 21,029\r\ndeaths, and 5713 marriages.\r\n\r\n[85] In 1857, the order baptized 23,227, joined in marriage 4830 couples,\r\nand buried 15,627.\r\n\r\n[86] The printed works obtained in the various monasteries of Manila\r\nconsist of dictionaries and small grammars of the Togala, Bisaya, Ilocana,\r\nTbanac, Bicol, and Pampangu dialects. The MSS. embrace vocabularies of the\r\nIgorotes and Ilongotes languages of Luzon, as also the idiom used by the\r\nnatives of the Marianne Archipelago, together with a short treatise on the\r\nMarianne group written in Spanish by a missionary. All these works will be\r\nthoroughly and exhaustively treated of in the ethnological portion, where\r\nalso the manuscripts will be published.\r\n\r\n[87] _Usted_--contraction for \"_Vuestra Merced_\" (your Grace).\r\n\r\n[88] The fair speeches and amiable phrases of the Spaniards lose all their\r\nvalue when one finds upon nearer acquaintance with this courteous nation,\r\nthat the heart and the feelings take no part therein. There is nothing\r\nwhich a Spaniard will not offer to a stranger--but it is always on the\r\nclear understanding that the latter will with equal politeness refuse the\r\nproffer. We on one occasion, however, saw a Yankee take these professions\r\nat their apparent value, and by so doing put his Spanish host to no small\r\nconfusion. The Spaniard wore a very costly diamond breast-pin, for which\r\nthe American could not find words sufficient to express his admiration. To\r\nhis exclamations of delight, the Spaniard kept repeating his nauseous \"_a\r\nla disposicion de Usted_,\" till at last the American fairly took the pin\r\nout of the Spaniard's scarf and transferred it to his own. The latter felt\r\nso ashamed and dumbfounded that he could not utter a word. The following\r\nday the American, who had only taken it by way of joke, returned the\r\ncostly bauble to the agonized Spaniard, but took occasion in so doing to\r\nremark that he now knew what was meant by Spanish courtesy.\r\n\r\n[89] On the island of Mactan (10 deg. 20' N., 124 deg. 10' E.) there was also\r\nerected on the promontory of Sugano, a monument to the memory of\r\nMagelhaens, and the happy idea was entertained of making it also into a\r\nlight-house, to warn ships of the danger in approaching the immense\r\nnumbers of reefs that are found here.\r\n\r\n[90] V. Heinrich Heine's \"Romanzero.\"\r\n\r\n[91] It was estimated, we were told, at from $35,000 to $40,000 annually.\r\n\r\n[92] Cock-fighting has been so long disused in England, that to most\r\npersons it only lingers as a grim tradition, mainly authenticated by\r\nHogarth's well-known painting. The degrading associations which a\r\ncock-fight generated are sufficiently well illustrated by the prince of\r\npictorial satirists. The \"betting-ring\" still brings together in England\r\nthe same intermingling of grades of society, and consequent utter\r\ndisruption of all social respect, but with all its faults it never has,\r\nnor can have, the same brutalizing effects of cock-fighting, which are\r\ninstanced by the following anecdote, extracted from the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_ for April, 1789, and which may even now be found to repay\r\nperusal:--\"Died at Tottenham, John Ardesoif, Esq., a young man of large\r\nfortune, ... who if he had his foibles, had also his merits (!) that far\r\noutweighed them. Mr. Ardesoif was very fond of cock-fighting, and had a\r\nfavourite cock, upon which he won many very profitable matches. The last\r\nbet he laid upon this cock, he lost; which so enraged him that he had the\r\nbird tied to a spit, and roasted alive before a large fire. The screams of\r\nthe miserable animal were so affecting that some gentlemen who were\r\npresent attempted to interfere, at which Mr. Ardesoif was so enraged that\r\nhe seized a poker, and with the most furious vehemence declared that he\r\nwould kill the first man that interfered, but in the midst of his\r\nasseveration he fell dead upon the spot! Such we are assured were the\r\ncircumstances attending the death of this great pillar of humanity!\"\r\n\r\n[93] This unhappy lady died a melancholy death, having, what rarely occurs\r\namong Spanish women, committed suicide at her hotel by swallowing Prussic\r\nacid. It was rumoured that an unhappy attachment led to this fatal\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\n[94] Of these straw-plait manufactories the cigar-holders are especially\r\nnoticeable for their fine texture and elegance. These are usually sold at\r\nvery high prices; some of the more elegant of these fetching from 40 to 50\r\ndollars (L8 to L10). Straw mats and hats, not inferior in fineness of\r\ntexture to those of Panama, are made here of palm fibre, and form a not\r\nunimportant article of exportation.\r\n\r\n[95] 8 reals = 1 Spanish piastre = 3_s._ 1-3/4_d._ at par; hence 1 real =\r\n4.71875_d._ English.\r\n\r\n[96] Owing to the universal interest felt in tobacco, the use of which has\r\nspread over the globe, till it has become a necessary of life to the\r\ncivilized man as well as the half-savage races of mankind, we subjoin by\r\nway of completing the information above attained, the following remarks\r\nupon the tobacco culture in other possessions of Spain, extracted from an\r\nunpublished journal, kept by a member of the Expedition, during a visit\r\npreviously paid to the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\"The best sites for growing tobacco in Cuba lie to the westward of the\r\ncapital in what is called the _Vuelta abajo_, between Rio Hondo and San\r\nJuan de Martinez, and is about ten English miles in circumference; the\r\ntobacco grown on the _Vuelta arriba_ is usually of inferior quality. In\r\n1856 there were in Cuba 10,000 plantations or _Vegas_, with a superficial\r\narea of 8000 _Caballerias_, (about 414 square miles, 1 Caballeria being\r\nequal to 160,371,041 English square yards, or 33,134 acres), cultivated by\r\nfrom 14,000 to 16,000 negro slaves. The total value of the capital\r\nemployed in this branch of culture (including manual labour, building\r\nutensils, draught animals, &c.) may be estimated at 13,000,000 piasters\r\n(L2,730,000), and the average weight of tobacco produced at a million and\r\na half _arrobas_, or 37,500,000 lbs. annually. Of this quantity 400,000\r\n_arrobas_, or 10,000,000 lbs., are consumed in Cuba itself, while the rest\r\nis exported partly in the leaf, partly in the manufactured state. One\r\n_Caballeria_ of ground can produce on the average about 360 _arrobas_, or\r\n9000 lbs., of which however only 1/20th will be of superior quality.\r\n\r\n\"A '_vega_' usually consists of three _Caballerias_, which are in regular\r\nsuccession devoted to the tobacco cultivation, so that while two are\r\ndevoted to maize and other vegetables for human subsistence, only the\r\nremaining third is under tobacco. The season for sowing is in October or\r\nNovember, and the crop is got in in January or February. On one\r\n_Caballeria_ there are usually found under favourable circumstances\r\n500,000 plants or _Matas_. Hence it results, that as the tobacco culture\r\nof Cuba extends over 8000 _Caballerias_, there are throughout the island\r\n4,000,000,000 plants. Each plant has from 8 to 10 suitable leaves. They\r\nare collected together in bundles, called _manojos_ (handfuls), of from\r\n120 to 130 leaves each, and 80 _manojos_ make one _tercio_, or 150 lbs. of\r\ntobacco. One _manojo_ weighs about 1-1/4 lbs., and when prepared\r\nmakes into about 400 cigars. There are in Cuba altogether 600\r\ncigar-manufactories, of which above 400 are in the capital alone. A\r\nworkman can make about 150 cigars a day; the rate of pay is about 10\r\nSpanish piasters or _duros_ for 1000. The manufacture of cigars gives\r\nemployment to about 20,000 workmen, chiefly males. Under the designation\r\nof _Tabagueros_, they constitute almost an exclusive class, and owing to\r\ntheir improvidence are usually in wretched plight. In Cuba (as in Luzon)\r\nthere is but one species of tobacco raised, but more attention seems to be\r\npaid to its cultivation in the former island. The leaves are sorted in\r\nCuba according to colour and 'vein' (_venas_), and their quality fixed\r\naccordingly. In commerce there are three sorts, viz.--\r\n\r\n  No. I. 42 to 45 Spanish piasters (L6 15_s._ to L7 5_s._) per 1000.\r\n     II. 32         \"       \"      (L5)                          \"\r\n    III. 28         \"       \"      (L4 10_s._)                   \"\r\n\r\nThe number of cigars annually exported from the Havanna averages from\r\n200,000,000 to 250,000,000, without including the _ramos_, or tobacco\r\nexported in the leaf. The cedar-tree (_Cedrela odorata_), of which the\r\ncigar-boxes are chiefly made, is occasionally prejudicial to the contents,\r\nin consequence of the slight dampness still remaining in the wood bringing\r\nout white spots of decay upon the tips of the cigars.\"\r\n\r\n[97] The United States of North America produce above 200,000 cwt., or\r\nmore than one half the whole supply. The annual consumption of tobacco by\r\nthe individual is in the United States 3-1/2 lbs., in England 1 lb. and\r\n1/2 oz., in France 1 lb. 1-1/2 oz., and in Germany 2 lbs.\r\n\r\n[98] The experiments made at Fort St. George near Madras in July, 1850,\r\nwith lines and rigging made of abaca and European hemp, with the view of\r\ntesting their respective availability, gave the following interesting\r\nresults: a rope of Manila hemp, 12 feet long, 3-1/4 inches in\r\ncircumference, and weighing 28-11/16 oz., required a strain of 4460 lbs.\r\nto break it: on the other hand a rope of English hemp of similar\r\ndimensions, weighing 39 oz., broke with a strain of only 3885 lbs. A\r\nsecond smaller rope of Manila hemp, 1-3/4 inches thick, and 9-1/2 oz.\r\nweight, also 12 feet in length, required 1490 lbs. to break it, while an\r\nexactly similar cord of English and Russian hemp, weighing 13 oz. per\r\nfathom, broke with 1184 lbs., so that in the first instance the abaca line\r\nwas 13 per cent., and in the second nearly 22 per cent. stronger than\r\nropes of similar size of European hemp.\r\n\r\n[99] Compare with Forbes Royle's valuable treatise upon Manila hemp,\r\nentitled \"The Fibrous Plants of India fitted for cordage, clothing, and\r\npaper.\" London, 1855.\r\n\r\n[100] The best Manila hemp is worth from 4-1/2 to 6 dollars per Spanish\r\n_picul_=140 lbs. Cordage made by steam power of the various dimensions,\r\nfrom half to one inch thick, sells at 25, and from one to five inches\r\nthick, at 10, piasters per _picul_.\r\n\r\n[101] The fabrics known by the name of _Sinamay_ are on the other hand\r\nmade of the fibres of the _Musa textilis_. They are of less gossamer\r\ntissue, but almost transparent, and far more durable than the fabrics made\r\nfrom the Pina.\r\n\r\n[102] According to Buzeta the Lagoon is 36 Spanish leagues in\r\ncircumference, by an average depth of 15 to 16 _brazos_ (fathoms). While\r\nthirteen rivers of various dimensions flow into the lake, the Pasig alone\r\nissues from it, to carry off its waters to the sea.\r\n\r\n[103] Pronounce Mahayhay.\r\n\r\n[104] The size attained by the alligator or cayman in the Laguna de Bay\r\nborders on the incredible. Baron Von Huegel, in his work already referred\r\nto, tells of a French settler in _Jalla-Jalla_ (pronounce Halla-Halla),\r\nwho assured him that he had once killed an alligator, whose head alone\r\nweighed 250 lbs., while the body was 10 feet in circumference! It lay\r\nburied in the sluice at the mouth of a river, and it proved so difficult\r\nto get it brought to land and cut up, that only the head was severed by\r\nway of trophy, and brought home to his house.\r\n\r\n[105] Cabeza, the head, whence it is further applied to express \"chief,\"\r\nor \"chieftain.\"\r\n\r\n[106] Another description of tax is the compulsory labour exacted from the\r\nnatives, which is expended in the construction of roads and bridges,\r\ntransmission of mail matter, transport of military baggage, luggage of\r\ntravellers, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n[107] These joss-sticks, by the Chinese called \"shi-shin-hiang,\" burn,\r\nwhen lighted, so slowly and regularly, that the Chinese often use them to\r\nmark the divisions of time.\r\n\r\n[108] The church was utterly ruined, and a large portion of the buildings\r\nare similarly in a most desolate, neglected condition. A hope was however\r\nexpressed that in the following year, 1859, members of the Society of\r\nJesus would come from Europe to settle in the Philippines, who would\r\ninclude among their other labours that of rebuilding their own cloister.\r\n\r\n[109] The graceful elegance of the Conchylia brought from Manila is so\r\nremarkable that an English ship captain, who, without a special knowledge\r\nof the matter, brought on speculation a freight of mussels from the\r\nPhilippines to Europe, not only made by their sale an enormous profit, but\r\neven attained in consequence to a certain degree of celebrity in the\r\nscientific world!\r\n\r\n[110] Unfortunately the students of Natural Science have met with but\r\nlittle encouragement or support from Government, and many parts of the\r\ninterior still remain a sealed book to them, or are only accessible under\r\ngreat difficulties. The deficiency of definite information respecting the\r\nisland attracts foreign naturalists thither, and of late there have been\r\nexploring it, M. M. Feodor Jagor of Berlin, Dr. Karl Semper of Hamburg,\r\nand La Porte of Paris, all intent on matters connected with the natural\r\nhistory of this Archipelago, but the majority of such visitants come back\r\ndiscontented and thoroughly undeceived to land, where all activity of\r\nscientific inquiry is allowed reluctantly, and regarded by the Government\r\nand the priests with an envious eye.\r\n\r\n[111] A Chinese sailor, on being asked why his vessel had an eye painted\r\non its bulwark, replied in Canton-English, \"Suppose no hab eye, how can\r\nsee?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Life in Hong-kong.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV.\r\n\r\n                               Hong-kong.\r\n\r\n             Duration of Stay from 5th to 18th July, 1858.\r\n\r\n    Rapid increase of the colony of Victoria or Hong-kong.--\r\n    Disagreeables.--Public character.--The Comprador, or\r\n    \"fac-totum.\"--A Chinese fortune-teller.--Curiosity-stalls.--The\r\n    To-stone.--Pictures on so-called rice-paper.--Canton-English.--\r\n    Notices on the Chinese language and mode of writing.--\r\n    Manufacture of ink.--Hospitality of German missionaries.--The\r\n    custom of exposing and murdering female children.--Method of\r\n    dwarfing the female foot.--Sir John Bowring.--Branch Institute\r\n    of the Royal Asiatic Society.--An ecclesiastical dignitary on\r\n    the study of natural sciences.--The Chinese in the East Indies.--\r\n    Green indigo or Lu-Kao.--Kind reception by German countrymen.--\r\n    Anthropometrical measurements.--Ramble to Little Hong-kong.--\r\n    Excursion to Canton on board H.M. gun-boat Algerine.--A day at\r\n    the English head-quarters.--The Treaty of Tien-Tsin.--Visit to\r\n    the Portuguese settlement of Macao.--Herr von Carlowitz.--\r\n    Camoens' Grotto.--Church for Protestants.--Pagoda Makok.--Dr.\r\n    Kane.--Present position of the colony.--Slave-trade revived\r\n    under the name of Chinese emigration.--Excursions round Macao.--\r\n    The Isthmus.--Chinese graves.--Praya Granite.--A Chinese\r\n    physician.--Singing stones.--Departure.--Gutzlaff's Island.--\r\n    Voyage to the Yang-tse-Kiang.--Wusung.--Arrival at Shanghai.\r\n\r\n\r\nVictoria, the name by which the settlement situate on the north side of\r\nthe island of Hong-kong is known in official documents, strongly recalls\r\nanother renowned British possession, Gibraltar. A mere uninviting granite\r\nrock of about 9 miles in length, 8 in breadth, and 26 in circumference,\r\nHong-kong, situate as it is at the mouth of the Canton River, is one of\r\nthe best harbours in the Chinese Empire. Owing to the barren, treeless\r\nsurface, which consists for the most part of chains of hills, the highest\r\npoint of which is 1825 feet above sea-level, with narrow valleys between,\r\nand a small extent of level ground around the bay, hardly a twentieth part\r\nof its surface is adapted to agriculture. The modern cheerful town,\r\nthoroughly European in character, has within these few years rapidly\r\nattained large dimensions, and its numerous palatial structures speak\r\nvolumes for the wealth and prosperity of the residents. The buildings of\r\nthe colony rise terrace-like one above another, and extend in rows all\r\nalong the steep slope of the granite, for a distance of nearly three\r\nmiles. Besides the population inhabiting the town, many thousand Chinese\r\nof the very lowest class with their wives and children live here in small\r\nboats year after year, so that the total population of the island amounts\r\nto about 80,000 souls.\r\n\r\nTwenty years back Hong-kong was but an insignificant place. Only since the\r\npeace of Nangking in 1842, which shook to its foundation the exclusive\r\nsystem till then prevalent, and among other important advantages secured\r\nthe island of Hong-kong to the English, besides bringing into the\r\ncommunity of nations the huge unwieldy empire with its 400,000,000,\r\noccupying 78 degrees of longitude and 38 of latitude, has it been\r\ndeveloped into the most important business centre of China. It became an\r\nemporium for all European manufactures, as well as for all produce from\r\nthe interior, which is shipped hence to the various marts of the world.\r\nUnfortunately the period at which the flag of the great Mandjing, or\r\nDouble Eagle, as the Chinese call Austria, was for the first time unfurled\r\non the shores of the Celestial Kingdom proved most unsuitable for\r\nscientific observation. While in the interior a variety of circumstances\r\nseriously threatened the stability of the throne of the reigning dynasty,\r\nthe flames of war were once more breaking out along the coast also, and\r\nadding to the confusion and distress of the Chinese diplomatists. In the\r\npresent war the English were for the first time in these waters fighting\r\nside by side with the French, while the Russians and North Americans were\r\ncautiously maintaining an observant, but none the less on that account\r\nmenacing attitude. The hatred and animosity of the Chinese populace,\r\nstirred up by their own authorities, was continually goaded to increasing\r\nfury with each new victory of the \"red-haired barbarians.\" The Chinese\r\nbakers in Hong-kong had devised the cruel expedient of poisoning the bread\r\npurchased by the English, and thus avenging themselves on the foe more\r\nfatally and more certainly than by Chinese weapons. Even while walking in\r\nthe neighbourhood one's life was not safe, and even the usually not very\r\neasily terrified Englishman was now begirt with \"revolvers,\" when he rode\r\nforth of an afternoon with his wife, or was taken in a sedan-chair to a\r\nfriend's house of an evening.\r\n\r\nShortly before our arrival, the captain of a merchantman, while taking a\r\nwalk outside the city, was set upon by some Chinese, robbed, and so\r\nseverely maltreated that he expired of the injuries he received. So too\r\nthe clerk of a mercantile house had been picked up just outside the city\r\nweltering in his blood and pierced with a number of wounds from a dagger,\r\nthe murderer in this case also evading detection. An attempt was even made\r\nagainst the life of the Governor, Sir John Bowring, which was only\r\nfrustrated through the vigilance of the sentinel, who discharged his piece\r\nat the scoundrels just as, favoured by night, they were stealing over the\r\nwalls of the Government-house, with the view of creeping through the\r\ngarden as far as Sir John's cabinet.\r\n\r\nEven in the most ordinary domestic matters might be traced the same\r\nrelentless hostility on the part of the Chinese, and the state of affairs\r\nwas becoming every day more intolerable to the European residents. All the\r\ndomestic servants at Hong-kong are Chinese, who come hither from the\r\nnearest provinces of the mainland, in order to benefit by the rate of\r\nwages paid by the \"foreign barbarian.\" The Chinese officials, vying with\r\neach other in every possible method of showing their implacable hatred to\r\nthe strangers and to embitter their life in China, now issued an order to\r\nall the Chinese resident in Hong-kong to quit the island and return to\r\ntheir native country. This ordinance would assuredly have been disregarded\r\nby most of the resident Chinese of the Middle Empire, had not any\r\nviolation of the Imperial rescripts been visited with such appalling\r\nconsequences. For by the Draconic laws of the Empire, the family of the\r\ncriminal expiate his offence, should he take to flight and get beyond the\r\nreach of the arm of Chinese justice. For any such absentee from justice,\r\nsome other member of the family is substituted, who may be still on the\r\nspot; as for instance, the father, mother, or brother, who is punished\r\nexactly as though he had in person been guilty of the crime or\r\nmisdemeanour. With such terrific means of repressing disobedience\r\nimpending over him, no Chinese would venture to set at defiance the orders\r\nof the Mandarins; and accordingly, during the summer of 1858, 10,000\r\nChinese returned home at once; others, who did not dare to return, but\r\ncould not endure that the ruthless doom should be executed upon their\r\nrelatives, committed suicide. The position of European ladies in Hong-kong\r\nbecame anything but enviable, as they had at a moment's notice to take up\r\nthe pot-ladle for themselves, and get through the various fatiguing\r\ndetails of their households with what skill they could. Moreover there was\r\ngood ground for apprehension that the Mandarins might cut off all\r\ncommunications with the neighbouring provinces, which move, as the greater\r\npart of the every-day necessaries of life are supplied from the mainland,\r\nmight have exposed the population of Hong-kong to the severest straits.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances any more remote excursions, or visits to the\r\nadjacent mainland, were of course impossible. We had to confine our\r\ninvestigations to the island itself, there to collect what memoranda we\r\ncould, and see as much of the island and its inhabitants as the shortness\r\nof our stay and the prevailing disorders might admit.\r\n\r\nLife in Hong-kong has already a strong leaven of western civilization.\r\nOnly in the narrowest streets does the visitor come upon examples of the\r\ngenuine Chinese type. Most of the natives even inhabit houses built in the\r\nEuropean style, so that one feels as though in a European city inhabited\r\nby a Chinese population, the latter having however greatly altered from\r\nits originality. Only very few types of Chinese popular life are met with\r\nin this English colony. Of these characters the most interesting and\r\nunique is the _Comprador_ (_Mai-pau_), a sort of factotum, whom no\r\nhousehold can dispense with, and whose importance only those can\r\nadequately do justice to who have lived some time in the country. The\r\nComprador, or _shroff_, is the soul, the good or evil genius, of the\r\nhouse: he sees to all sorts of purchases, manages the domestic economy,\r\nand maintains order and discipline in the house and household. The entire\r\ndomestic control is exclusively lodged in his hands, to that extent that\r\neven the master and mistress of the house may not, without consulting the\r\nComprador, dismiss one of the servants or engage a new one. For all that\r\ngoes on, the latter is responsible. He has to answer for the honesty of\r\nthe servants, and must replace anything that may have gone amissing from\r\nthe house inventory. If the family leave their house for any time, the\r\nComprador is informed of the place where the most valuable articles are\r\ndeposited, where they are more likely to be found in proper order on their\r\nreturn than by any other device. Even during the late war, in which the\r\nfeeling of the Chinese to the Europeans was anything but friendly, the\r\nComprador held to his fidelity, and was as useful as ever. In view of the\r\nactual state of matters, a traveller must feel no little astonishment at\r\nbeholding the doors and windows of the private dwelling-houses everywhere\r\nwide open, and valuable articles lying exposed in the various apartments.\r\nAs however the Comprador himself must get a number of bails to become\r\nresponsible for him, and as the post is a very profitable one, it follows\r\nthat there are but few cases of dishonesty in this singular profession. It\r\nis especially remarkable that few of the populace seem to be as hostile to\r\nthe strangers as the Mandarins, and all the numerous annoyances inflicted\r\non the latter are invariably to be traced to the intrigues of the Chinese\r\nauthorities. How else would it be possible for a couple of hundred\r\nEuropeans to rule a colony in which are 80,000 Chinese, and which moreover\r\nis dependent upon the mainland for the very first necessities of life?\r\n\r\nThe Comprador receives for all his services and attentions no higher pay\r\nthan from 12 to 15 dollars a month, besides support for himself and\r\nfamily. This however is not his sole income, as every tradesman must give\r\nthe Comprador a per-centage upon everything, even the most insignificant\r\narticle that enters the house, and this custom even extends to any\r\npurchases made by a Chinese in the warehouses of the foreign merchant.\r\n\r\nAnother \"public character,\" whom one frequently meets in the lower parts\r\nof the city in the public streets of the Chinese quarter, is the\r\n\"soothsayer.\" On a small table before him stands an open draught-board\r\nwith a number of squares, on which are inscribed a variety of proverbs and\r\noracular sayings. In each square is a grain of rice, and quite close to\r\nthe board is a bird-cage with a tame canary. Presently some good-humoured\r\ngaping rustic comes up, who wishes to learn his destiny, upon which the\r\nsoothsayer suffers the canary to hop out of his cage upon one of the\r\nsquares, and pick up a grain of rice _ad libitum_. The sentences and\r\ninterpretations, which are inscribed on each square from which the canary\r\nsnaps up his food serve for a reply and decision to the curious\r\nquestioner, who hands over a small _honorarium_. The apparatus is simple\r\nand ingenious, but the proverbs are excessively silly, and recall much\r\nless the land of Confucius than the dream-books of certain countries\r\nstanding high in European civilization.\r\n\r\nThe stores which seem most to attract the attention of a stranger are the\r\n\"Curiosity-shops,\" in which are heaped up those innumerable articles of\r\nChinese industry and Chinese taste which are so characteristic of the\r\ncountry and its inhabitants. Here the eye rests upon objects of the most\r\nbizarre shapes, which in material design and execution are totally unlike\r\nanything the European sees elsewhere; workmanship in wood and stone, that\r\nillustrates in a remarkable manner the extraordinary patience of the\r\nartisan, such as drinking-cups, barrels, frames, cut all in one piece, and\r\nbeautifully carved, elegant fancy articles of horn, stone,\r\nmother-of-pearl, ivory, roots of trees, metal, or wood, vases and dishes,\r\nstatuettes in copper and clay, woven portraits, embroidery, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nAmong all these various manufactures, one especially remarks those\r\nprepared from a leek-green, slimy-feeling stone (nephrite), which is in\r\nmuch request among the Chinese, and is highly valued. The Chinese name,\r\nYo, from which in all probability is derived the French name _Jade_, does\r\nnot indicate however a peculiar species, but is used for all sorts of\r\ncarved stone-work and gems, while the most valuable one is called by the\r\nChinese the \"mutton-fat\" stone. The articles prepared of what is named\r\nsteatite, or soap-stone, are largely used in commerce, but are of very\r\nsmall value, and usually cut only in very clumsy figures.\r\n\r\nBut these manufactures make much less impression upon the stranger than\r\nthe beautiful pictures of the Chinese artists upon rice-paper, a peculiar\r\nbranch of art, cultivated by the Chinese alone, and which as yet has never\r\nbeen successfully imitated in any other country. The most exquisite\r\nspecimens of these are sent to Canton, but among the Chinese in Hong-kong\r\nwe saw several beautiful works in this style of painting. The common\r\ndesignation of rice-paper has led to the erroneous idea that the substance\r\nof which these pictures are made is manufactured from the leaves of the\r\nrice-plant, whereas it is prepared from the pith of an entirely different\r\nplant (_Aralia papyrifera_), which grows in Funan and Tukun. The marrow is\r\nsteeped for some time in water, after which it is split by means of very\r\nkeen sharp knives into thin leaves, which are then subjected to gentle\r\npressure. The largest are about a foot square, and are reserved almost\r\nexclusively for pictures, the shreds and inferior sorts alone being used\r\nfor the manufacture of artificial flowers. We saw portraits of the Emperor\r\nand Empress, of the rebel leader, Tai-ping, of the notorious Yeh,\r\nex-governor of Canton, and other well-known or conspicuous personages.\r\nLatterly there has sprung up a strong tendency among the Chinese artists\r\nto daguerreotypes and photographs in miniature upon ivory; and in the\r\n_ateliers_ of Hong-kong a number of artists were engaged in this, at\r\npresent the most profitable branch of Chinese artistic skill.\r\n\r\nIn all these shops the medium of trade is what is called Canton-English,\r\nless a dialect than a confused jargon of English and Chinese words,\r\nconsisting of concessions made on either side to the grammar and idiom of\r\nthe other, so as the more readily to comprehend each other. A few Spanish\r\nand Portuguese words have also crept in, recalling the former relations of\r\nthese countries with China. All English words ending in _e_ mute have in\r\nthis gibberish an _i_ attached to them, as also all other words whatever.\r\nThus they say _timi_, _housi_, _pieci_, _coachi_, _cooki_, &c. &c. There\r\nare certain Chinese, especially in Canton, who pick up a living by\r\ninitiating young country folks, who are about entering service in English\r\nmercantile houses, in this singular language. Curious and unpleasant as\r\nthis Chinese English dialect sounds in the ears of strangers, it is found\r\ngreatly to facilitate intercourse with the Chinese, in consequence of the\r\nimmense difficulties attending the study of Chinese, so that most\r\nEuropeans find it far more comfortable to master this jargon, which is not\r\nwithout some influence on the spread of English in the chief commercial\r\ncities, than to occupy themselves with mastering Chinese. The language\r\nspoken by the sons of the \"middle kingdom\" consists of 450 monosyllabic\r\nsounds, which by various delicate differences in accentuation may increase\r\nto about 1600. The slight, and to unaccustomed ears almost inappreciable,\r\nshades of aspiration and accentuation, are the main difficulty in the way\r\nof foreigners desirous of learning the Chinese language.\r\n\r\nTo learn the written characters is equally arduous, and requires not less\r\ntime and perseverance; for this does not consist of a number of letters,\r\nthe varying arrangement of which constitutes words, but of 40,000 more or\r\nless complicated signs, each of which expresses a whole word. They are\r\nrude forms, representing most imperfectly ideas and material objects;[112]\r\nhowever, the knowledge of 4000 to 6000 such signs, with their various\r\nsignifications, suffices to understand most of the common Chinese books.\r\nThese singular hieroglyphics are not written horizontally but vertically.\r\nMoreover, the Chinese begin from the right side, so that, directly the\r\nreverse of the European custom, the title of a Chinese book is found on\r\nthe first page, the leaf furthest to the right hand. Long ago, the\r\nChinese, like most other Asiatic nations at the present day, wrote with\r\nmetal _styli_ upon split leaves of bamboo. Ever since the third century\r\nbefore Christ, however, when the art was invented of making paper from the\r\nrind of the mulberry tree and the bamboo-cane, and preparing pin-soot,\r\nglair, musk, glue, Indian ink[113] (meh), and other substances, the\r\npencil has taken the place of the graver. The hieroglyphics now made on\r\npaper are softer, more elegant, and in distinctness of outline admit\r\ngreater varieties of form. Most of the Chinese whom we saw engaged in\r\nwriting formed the most complicated characters with great celerity and\r\nease upon the thin paper, and without the firm strokes losing anything of\r\ntheir neatness and clearness of outline.\r\n\r\nAmong the various scientific objects recommended as important objects of\r\ninquiry to the members of the Expedition, during their visit to China, by\r\nthe renowned sinologue Dr. Pfitzmaier, was the obtaining of rare Chinese\r\nbooks, and the elucidation of certain ethnographic and linguistic\r\nquestions. Whatever was achieved by us in throwing light upon these\r\nmatters is due in great measure to the cordial reception with which we\r\nwere received by men of science resident at Hong-kong. Especially we would\r\nname in this respect Dr. M. Lobscheid, a German by birth, a missionary and\r\ninspector of schools, who, thoroughly conversant with the Chinese\r\nlanguage, exerted himself to the utmost in forwarding the objects of the\r\nscientific corps, besides assisting us in the purchase of a variety of the\r\nmost valuable Chinese works, and giving us much interesting information\r\nrespecting the country and the inhabitants. Dr. Lobscheid himself has a\r\nwell-selected, valuable, and extensive library of rare Chinese works on\r\ngeography, natural science, history, philology, and numismatics, and\r\npresented a number of valuable gifts to the Expedition. One of his\r\ncolleagues, Dr. Ph. Winnes, also a German, and a missionary from the\r\nMission Society of Bale, compiled for us a list of words of the Hakka\r\ndialect, as spoken in the interior of the province of Quang-Tung, hitherto\r\nso little known philologically. It is indeed astonishing what English, and\r\nGerman, and American missionaries have effected as publicists, during the\r\nshort period they have been resident here. The educational and religious\r\nworks published in Chinese at the expense of the various religious\r\nsocieties form already quite a respectable literature of themselves,\r\nalthough the Chinese language puts as many obstacles in the way of mere\r\nChristian civilization as in that of the propagation of the Evangile\r\nitself. Most of the missionaries consider any attempt to substitute Romish\r\nfor Chinese characters as being quite vain. The indistinctness of Chinese\r\nsigns has already been fruitful of much controversy among the missionaries\r\nthemselves. Thus, for example, those engaged in promulgating the Christian\r\nfaith are not as yet agreed by what Chinese word the God of Christianity\r\nmay best be indicated. The Roman Catholic missionaries write _Tientschu_\r\n(the Highest of all things); the English and German Protestants use the\r\nsign _Schang-Ti_ (the Most High); the American Protestants make use of the\r\nword _Schin_ (Spirit). These varieties of opinion as to the mode of\r\nexpressing the idea of \"God,\" have given rise to a vast number of\r\npublications, which however have unfortunately tended rather to envenom\r\nthe dispute than smooth the way to a common understanding.\r\n\r\nConspicuous, however, as are the services of the missionaries in the\r\npublication and diffusion of useful and moral books in the Chinese\r\nlanguage, their direct efforts have, on the other hand, been attended with\r\nbut limited results hitherto, and although it is always laid down as an\r\naxiom in the books and manifestoes of the Tai-Ping insurgents, that the\r\ndoctrines of Christianity, as deduced from the writings of the Missionary\r\nSocieties, are the leading principle of the movement, yet, as set forth\r\nand promulgated by the insurgent chiefs, they cannot be said to deserve\r\nrecognition by any known form of Christianity.\r\n\r\nAs in their religion, so in their mode of life, and their national\r\ncustoms, the Chinese remain stiff-necked and obstinate, and in this\r\ndirection also Christianity is in but few cases capable of mitigating\r\ntheir frequently barbarous customs. Children in China are constantly\r\nexposed in large numbers, and that not owing to poverty, but from\r\nindifference to the female children. One Chinese woman who at present\r\nprofesses Christianity, and is a member of the Bale missionary community,\r\nhas herself killed eight female children whom she had herself carried in\r\nher womb! Dr. Lobscheid informed us that he was personally cognizant of\r\none case, where a Chinese mother-in-law, irritated at the birth of a\r\nfemale child, murdered it before its mother's eyes, almost immediately\r\nafter it had come into the world, and this in a rather well-to-do family!\r\nYoung mothers often lay their children down in the open field, or on the\r\nsea-beach, watching anxiously if any one takes it away, or till a wave\r\nmercifully sweeps it off. One such infant, accidentally found by some of\r\nthe crew of the English frigate _Nankin_, and tended with all the\r\ntender-heartedness of Jack when he finds an object of compassion, is at\r\npresent in the German Mission House at Hong-kong, and was baptized in the\r\ncathedral by the chaplain of the frigate, who gave her the name of\r\nVictoria Nankin. Other mothers endeavour to choke the new-born girl with\r\nmoistened ashes, which, not unfrequently with caressing hand, they lay\r\nupon the mouth of the little unconscious innocent. Male children, on the\r\nother hand, even such as are crippled or deformed, are very seldom, indeed\r\nquite exceptionally, exposed or put to death. In proportion to the harsh\r\ntreatment which the female offspring experience, is the pride and anxious\r\ncarefulness which wait on the male children. Indeed the Chinese are very\r\nmuch in the habit of having several wives, simply because by so doing they\r\nof course have a better chance of a number of male offspring, and it very\r\nfrequently happens that the lawful wife of a Chinaman, if she has\r\ncontinued any length of time childless, will even seek out and bring to\r\nher husband a concubine by whom he may have heirs, that is, _sons_.[114]\r\nIn such cases the two wives usually continue on the best of terms, which\r\ncannot be said of those instances where the second or third wife is\r\nintroduced into the family by the husband, without the intervention of his\r\nwife. According to the old Chinese law, the man had to be thirty, the\r\nwoman twenty, before marriage. At present marriages, as a rule, are made\r\nbetween sixteen and twenty years of age. It may be assumed that one in\r\nevery fifteen Chinese has more than one wife; the first, usually known as\r\n\"number one,\" is generally taken from inclination, whereas the rest are\r\nusually bought, the price varying, according to their youth and beauty,\r\nfrom 100 to 600 dollars. This custom gives rise to quite a peculiar trade.\r\nChinese women make a practice of purchasing for themselves from the poorer\r\nclasses such of the female children as are of good health and well formed,\r\nwhom they bring up with great care, with the view of selling them, when\r\ngrown up, to the wealthy Chinese, and even sometimes to--European\r\nresidents.[115] The custom of child-murder is most prevalent in the coast\r\ndistricts of the province of Fo-kien, so that latterly there was a\r\npositive scarcity of women, and marriageable girls had to be imported from\r\nthe northern part of the province. The prevalence of this custom of\r\nchild-murder in these localities is to be ascribed to the enormous\r\nmigration of the male population to Siam, to the islands of the Malay\r\nArchipelago, and other points. These emigrants supply the labour market in\r\nforeign countries, and but seldom return to their families. Numerous\r\nplacards and pamphlets, pointing out the enormity of child-murder, and\r\ndissuading from its commission, are printed annually, partly at the cost\r\nof philanthropists, partly at that of the Chinese Government, and widely\r\ndiffused, yet without producing any diminution in the practice of this\r\nappalling custom.\r\n\r\nThe custom of distorting the feet of the better class of women at the\r\nperiod of their birth, seems to have arisen from the jealousy of the\r\nhusbands, who in thus preventing the possibility of gadding about, think\r\nthey have secured an additional guarantee for the fidelity and chastity of\r\ntheir wives. However, one occasionally hears the first introduction of\r\nthis singular and cruel custom ascribed to a Chinese empress having once\r\nbeen born with such distortion of the feet, and that in consequence it not\r\nonly became the fashion among the females of the higher class in those\r\ndays, out of pure obsequiousness, to imitate by artificial means a\r\ndisfiguration accidentally arising from a freak of Nature, but even to\r\nrecognize it as a necessary concomitant of the Chinese ideal of beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Hong-kong, Sir John Bowring, a distinguished _savant_, who\r\nreceived the members of the Expedition with the utmost consideration,\r\ninvited them to his house and endeavoured to bring them into personal\r\ncommunication with those residents in the colony most interested in\r\nscientific pursuits, so that each one of us could consult with the\r\ngentleman best able to advise him in his own department, and thus attain\r\nin the shortest time the most satisfactory results. Sir John, moreover, as\r\nPresident of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, admitted the\r\nmembers of the Expedition to the honours of an extraordinary session. He\r\nwelcomed the Austrian naturalists in the heartiest manner, and expressed\r\nthe most flattering anticipations from their visit. Very deserving of\r\nremark was the speech made on this occasion by the Lord Bishop of\r\nHong-kong. In his capacity of a dignitary of the Church, he too bade us\r\nwelcome in the warmest manner, and expressed his conviction that\r\nChristianity had nothing to fear, but only to hope, from the study of\r\nnatural sciences! What would certain ultramontanists, had they been\r\npresent, have replied to this remark of a high ecclesiastical\r\ndignitary?--they who consider government impossible without restricting\r\nthe study of the natural sciences!\r\n\r\nAmong the various subjects discussed at this meeting were several of great\r\ninterest, which sufficiently evidenced what a thorough disposition to\r\nmental activity the English show, even in a place where material interests\r\nare necessarily the main objects of attention, and where they, moreover,\r\nare continually exposed to great personal danger.\r\n\r\nOne of the communications received by the Society was a memoir by Mr. W.\r\nAlabaster, who had accompanied ex-governor Yeh to Calcutta as interpreter,\r\ntreating of the Chinese population there, and its influence on the state\r\nof society. The memoir contained the very remarkable statement that the\r\nChinese colony in Calcutta, which in 1858 counted little more than 500\r\nsouls, had not alone monopolized several employments, such as shoemakers,\r\ntailors, &c., but had, even when thousands of miles distant from home,\r\njealously maintained several of their customs and rites intact. This\r\nChinese community, so inconsiderable in point of mere numbers, already\r\npossesses its own temple, its own priests, and its own teachers, who guard\r\nany Chinese immigrants from the perils of proselytism; it has founded a\r\nspecial association, whose object it is to transmit to their native land\r\nthe bodies of such as die abroad, while their luxury is beginning to\r\ndevelope itself to the extent of ordering from China at considerable\r\nexpense troops of actors, so as even at this distance to provide\r\nthemselves with the national amusement of a genuine Sing-Song. This\r\npeculiarity is of great importance, inasmuch as the emigration from China\r\nis ever assuming more extended dimensions, and already embraces several\r\nportions of the world. We find Chinese scattered throughout Eastern Asia,\r\nin Australia, in California, in Peru, in Brazil, in the West Indies, and,\r\nwhat is very astonishing they thrive and prosper at most places they\r\nvisit, despite the not very humane treatment they receive, and the\r\nwretched, desolate state in which they leave their homes. This enormous\r\nemigration of the sons of the Flowery Land seems destined to be of immense\r\nimportance, and to be fraught with momentous influence upon the future of\r\nthe other Asiatic populations, whom the Chinese greatly excel in capacity\r\nfor work, mechanical dexterity, and dogged perseverance. Even the\r\nreligious movement gives the Chinese certain advantages over all other\r\nnations of the Asiatic type of civilization. The Hindoo, like the\r\nCatholic, has numbers of festivals, which greatly diminish the number of\r\nhis actual working days; the daily ceremonies prescribed by Brahminism\r\nfurther curtail the most precious hours of labour; his exclusively\r\nvegetarian food not alone prevents the proper development of his muscular\r\npower, but also by its ostentatiously morbid delicacy, brings him\r\nconstantly into collision with the social order of a Christian household.\r\nThe Chinese, on the other hand, keeps but one holiday-time, the beginning\r\nof the new year, which he celebrates for fourteen days without\r\nintermission. But the remaining 11-1/2 months of the year are for him but\r\none long day of work. Moreover, the Chinese has no fastidious notions\r\nabout his food. He eats pork, and drinks wine, and prefers fat meat to\r\nmeagre fruit diet, thoroughly unrestrained by any considerations as to\r\nwhether such a mode of life accords with the institutes of Brahma and\r\nMenu, or the teaching of Confucius. Their sobriety, their capacity, their\r\nindustry, their frugal mode of life, and their numbers, all seem to\r\nindicate the Chinese as destined to play an important part, not alone in\r\nthe development of the Oriental nations, but also in the history of\r\nmankind. They are, as a German philosopher has profoundly remarked, the\r\nGreeks and Romans of Eastern Asia, and they will, if once hurried onwards\r\nby the great tide of Christian civilization, perform such feats as to\r\nfill even the nations of the old world with wonder and amazement.\r\n\r\nAnother communication, made during the same meeting of this meritorious\r\nbranch of the Royal Asiatic Society in Hong-kong, related to that singular\r\nplant, which has within the last few years excited so much attention in\r\nindustrial circles throughout Europe under the name of \"Green dye,\" or\r\n\"Vert Chinois.\" Notwithstanding the experiments hitherto made with this\r\nvaluable dye, and the excellent use which has been made of it, more\r\nespecially by the Chamber of Commerce at Lyons, the first in Europe to\r\nmake application of the new colour, there was yet much to be learned\r\nrespecting the mode of raising and manufacturing it, in order to render\r\nits employment entirely practicable. The elegant pamphlet of the Lyons\r\nChamber of Commerce[116] had just arrived from Europe, and led to a\r\nvariety of interesting investigations. Nothing was known in Hong-kong\r\nrespecting the plant beyond what was already contained in Robert Fortune's\r\nexcellent work and Rondot's treatise. Somewhat later, we were furnished\r\nwith more accurate and circumstantial information respecting the Lu-Kao,\r\nthe well-known \"Green dye\" of the English (a species of _Rhamnus_ or\r\nbuckthorn), which we shall here transcribe pretty fully.[117]\r\n\r\nLu-Kao is grown chiefly in the northern provinces, extensive plantations\r\nof this valuable plant existing in the country around Foo-Chow and the\r\nenvirons of the city of Haening. The valuable green dye matter is\r\nobtained, however, from the rind, not of one but of two species _Rhamnus_,\r\nof which the \"yellow\" grows on the flats, the \"white\" on the high-grounds\r\nin a wild state. The preparation of the substance, which does not differ\r\nmuch in appearance from common indigo, is exceedingly primitive. Both\r\nplants are boiled for a considerable time in iron kettles, the yellow\r\ndeposit or _residuum_ being suffered to remain undisturbed for several\r\ndays. Transferred thence into earthen vessels, a piece of cotton cloth is\r\nsteeped into it five or six times, after which the adherent dye is wrung\r\nout, and exposed a second time to the process of boiling in iron pans. The\r\nnext step in the manipulation consists in permitting the dye stuff, which\r\nnow has much more consistence, to be soaked up by some pieces of cotton,\r\nwhen it is once more washed, sprinkled upon thin paper, and, lastly,\r\nexposed for some time to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have as yet only used the dye for colouring cloths of coarse\r\ntexture; all attempts hitherto to apply it to silks, &c., have proved\r\nfruitless. But the great development of chemical science in Europe\r\njustifies us in expecting that a method will ere long be devised for\r\nfixing this beautiful, durable light green tint, which does not alter even\r\nin candlelight, upon fabrics of fine smooth texture, and thus greatly\r\nenhance its value in the industrial arts. The Lu-Kao has from time\r\nimmemorial been used by the Chinese in watercolour paintings, but its use\r\nin industrial processes only dates from about 20 years back. The very\r\nprice charged for the small quantities hitherto brought from China, is by\r\nno means natural, but seems to have been artificially forced up by\r\nspeculation, apparently in consequence of an unusual demand. In Foo-Chow\r\nthe price of one Catti, about 1-3/4 lbs., is 20 _Taels_, or about L6\r\n10_s._ Were the production of this dye stuff really so expensive, we may\r\nbe sure it would not be made use of by the Chinese for their ordinary\r\nstuffs, nor could these be sold as cheap as they are. We have found our\r\nopinion confirmed by competent observers in various parts of China, that\r\nthis valuable product is susceptible of being acclimatized in Europe, and\r\nof being cultivated with profit, especially in those places where,\r\ntogether with favourable conditions of temperature and soil, the wages of\r\nlabour are not too high.\r\n\r\nLike the English authorities and Government officials, our German\r\nfellow-countrymen, resident in Hong-kong, did not fail to exercise their\r\nhospitality for the benefit of the associates of the Expedition, and we\r\ncannot sufficiently express our obligations to the Austrian Consul, Mr. G.\r\nWiener, and the Prussian vice-consul, Mr. Gustav Oberbeck, for their\r\ndelicate attention. The latter presented the Expedition with a number of\r\narticles interesting as illustrating the advances of civilization, which\r\nhe had obtained during the siege of Canton, in Dec. 1857, and of which the\r\ngreater part have since been deposited at the Imperial Cabinet of\r\nAntiquities at Vienna.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness and interest of Dr. Harland (since deceased),\r\nsurgeon-in-chief of the colony, some of the members of the Expedition were\r\nenabled to make corporeal measurements in the great prison, the inmates of\r\nwhich come from the most various parts of the empire, as well as in the\r\nhospital, upon a number of individuals of either sex, all \"fair specimens\r\nof the Chinese race,\" as Dr. Harland assured them, the results of which\r\nwill be found in the anthropological section of the _Novara_ publications.\r\n\r\nBefore the frigate left Hong-kong, despite the insecurity of public\r\naffairs, several excursions were made to the south side of the island, to\r\nCanton, and to the Portuguese settlement of Macao, which proved as\r\ninteresting as they were satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their peregrinations about the mountains on the island,\r\nas far as the fishing village on the south side of the island, known as\r\nLittle Hong-kong (sweet-waters), the naturalists of the Expedition were\r\naccompanied by Dr. Hance, the botanist, and the missionary, Dr. Lobscheid,\r\nboth thoroughly acquainted with the Chinese language. Little as the pretty\r\nname of this small settlement, founded so far back as 1668, is applicable\r\nto the entire island, it yet corresponds well, and is eminently suitable,\r\nto the smiling valley, entirely shut in by lofty rocks, in which lies\r\nwretched Little Hong-kong. A beautiful wood filled with tufts of flowers,\r\nforming for the labours of the botanist a rich supply of the most splendid\r\nplants, and refreshed by copious springs of water from the mountains,\r\nconstitute a lovely landscape. Above the limit of vegetation of the\r\nfoliage trees, are seen on the slopes of the mountain groups of pines,\r\nwhile the level ground at the bottom of the valley is laid out in smiling\r\nrice fields. The miserable inhabitants of the village, which looks\r\ngloomily out from among the trees, are not safe from the predatory\r\nonslaughts of ferocious pirates, even among the recesses of the valley.\r\nThe streets of the village, hidden between trees, are uncommonly narrow,\r\nso that two men can scarcely pass each other, and the huts are all placed\r\non purpose close against each other, in order, we were told, to be able\r\nmore easily to admit of defence. Our rambles were rewarded with an\r\nabundant collection of specimens, and were particularly instructive in a\r\ngeognostical point of view, as satisfying us that the island does not\r\nconsist entirely of granite, but that a large proportion of the mountain\r\nis porphyritic.\r\n\r\nAnother excursion was made by the Commodore and some of his staff as far\r\nas Canton. The Commandant of the station, Commodore Stewart, had for this\r\npurpose placed the gun-boat _Algerine_ at our disposal. The distance from\r\nHong-kong to Canton is about 87 nautical miles (100 statute miles), and\r\nthe voyage took full eleven hours, viz. from 6.30 A.M. to 5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nCanton, the third capital of the Chinese Empire, and its most flourishing\r\ncommercial city, which but a short time before had numbered about\r\n1,000,000 inhabitants, was at this period a desolate, almost entirely\r\nabandoned mass of houses, half in ruins, half burnt. The stately European\r\nfactories, which had adorned the banks of the river up to the walls of the\r\nChinese city, were heaps of ashes. The floating town upon the river\r\nitself, the renowned flower-boats of Canton, with their marvellous\r\nsplendour and their luxurious beauty, had entirely disappeared, leaving no\r\ntrace. Whoever had anything to lose had fled the country. English\r\nsentinels patrolled the walls and occupied the streets of the interior of\r\nthe city, and only the very poorest of the mob remained behind, watching\r\nevery opportunity of getting the \"head-money,\" which the Mandarins of the\r\nprovince of Kuang-Tung had offered for every head of a \"barbarian\" brought\r\nin. \"The state of matters in Canton gets worse and worse every day,\" said\r\nthe latest issue of the Hong-kong journals. Since the Americans and\r\nRussians had concluded private treaties with the Imperial Government, and\r\nthe English and French allied fleet had gone north to the Gulf of\r\nPe-Cheli, to treat at Tien-Tsin with the Imperial commissioners, the\r\nChinese of Canton had been plucking up courage. They conceived the allies\r\nto be isolated; the Russians and the Americans they held to be hostile to\r\nthem. The Mandarins and Imperial commissioners launched proclamations by\r\nthe dozen at the \"foreign devils,\"[118] set on foot organized Guerilla\r\nbands, which were called \"Braves,\" who every night discharged rockets\r\ninto the city, murdered and pillaged, and kept the allied troops, who were\r\nonly 3500 strong (800 of whom were in hospital) almost continually on the\r\nalert.\r\n\r\nWhen the gun-boat _Algerine_ arrived off Canton, the Commodore, although\r\nit was late in the evening, was accompanied by a military escort to the\r\nhead-quarters of General Straubenzee, commander of the allied troops. A\r\nstillness as of a grave-yard reigned throughout the city, and not a light\r\nwas to be seen. By 10.30 P.M. the Commodore reached the post, and was\r\nmost hospitably received by the General. The head-quarters were situated\r\non a hillock commanding the city, surrounded by the numerous buildings of\r\na country-seat or _Yamun_, which had been the property of the father of\r\nGovernor Yeh, who had acquired such notoriety during the recent warlike\r\ntroubles. The ostentatious splendour of the apartments, the splendid ebony\r\ncarved work, gave such an idea of the magnificence, the luxury, the\r\ngorgeousness of the Chinese princes, as can only be paralleled by what we\r\nread of the palaces of the emperors of ancient Rome. Yeh himself had by\r\nthis time been removed from the political scene, and was a state prisoner\r\nin Calcutta, where he lived in more than monastic seclusion. To judge by\r\nhis portrait, which was for sale in all the print-shops of Hong-kong, Yeh\r\nwas a fine-looking man with energetic features, and an expression full of\r\nintellect, and, so far as his physical appearance went, seemed to take\r\nafter his father, who in his ninety-second year was still tasting joys of\r\npaternity. In his own country, even among the Europeans, Yeh enjoys the\r\nreputation of being not only an able diplomatist, but a man of varied\r\ninformation as well. While at Hong-kong we were shown some large\r\nanatomical woodcuts, which Yeh had himself borrowed from a European work\r\non anatomy, and published at his own cost on an enlarged scale,\r\naccompanied by a preface from his pen.[119]\r\n\r\nEven more extensive and elegant in its outward aspect than that of Yeh,\r\nwas the palace of the Tartar general Pihkwei, now employed for barracks\r\nand the officers of the English and French commissariat, while a much less\r\npretentious building had been assigned to the Tartar general for his\r\npresent residence.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore had reached head-quarters and was sitting at the tea-table\r\nwith General Straubenzee, when an alarm of fire was heard. The \"Braves\"\r\nhad fired a house close by in the hope, it should seem, that the flames\r\nwould catch the barracks as well as the powder depot, or at all events\r\ncompel the English to withdraw their troops from the post, and give an\r\nopportunity for inflicting some loss on them. Fortunately, however, what\r\nhad been set on fire burned quite out, without fulfilling the\r\nanticipations of the \"Braves.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of a stroll, which our Commodore took with the General\r\nsomewhat later in the night, they perceived that the Chinese kept up a\r\ncontinual flight of rockets against the sentries and buildings of the\r\npost, from a small eminence not two hundred yards distant, which was\r\nprovided with ramparts and cannon, and the Austrian guests greatly\r\nmarvelled that no energetic steps were taken to obviate the disorders\r\nproduced by these guerilla bands of Chinese, who every night with their\r\nincendiarism and fire-balls kept the city, the head-quarters, and the\r\npickets in constant alarm, seeing that their inactivity only tended to\r\nanimate the courage of the Chinese, while in such harassing service,\r\nunattended as it was with any results, their own forces, already very much\r\nreduced, were proportionately weakened.\r\n\r\nThe morning after their arrival the Austrian officers, accompanied by the\r\nEnglish commissioner Mr. Parkes, whose imprisonment near Pekin has since\r\nmade his name widely and universally known, paid a visit to the sole\r\nChinese authority still remaining in the town, the Tartar General and\r\nMandarin, Pi-Kwei. An immense crowd had assembled in the streets through\r\nwhich the foreigners wended their way, and their reception by the Tartar\r\nGeneral was accompanied by all the ceremonial of Chinese etiquette: three\r\nhowitzer salvo-shots, and ear-splitting Chinese music, the General's\r\nbody-guard, disarmed, drawn up on the staircase, the General himself,\r\nwearing his Mandarin cap on his head, nodding and laughing more or less to\r\nthe foreigners presented, according to their higher or lower rank. The\r\nCommodore was provided with a raised seat. In the course of conversation,\r\nduring which Mr. Parkes kindly acted as interpreter, tea was served.\r\nPi-Kwei inquired as to the objects of the Expedition, and asked the names\r\nof the officers, which, owing to the symbolic nature of Chinese writing,\r\ncould not be done but after much difficulty. Pi-Kwei, a man of colossal\r\nproportions, behaved and spoke like a lamb in presence of the small\r\nphysically insignificant-looking Mr. Parkes. Like the regents appointed by\r\nthe Dutch Government in Java, he was nothing more than the agent to carry\r\nout the orders of the English.\r\n\r\nOur departure was not less ceremonious and noisy than our reception: a\r\nnumber of fire-balls were let off in front of the building, the noise of\r\nwhich gave much more the impression of an infernal machine than a salute.\r\nThe rest of the day the officers spent in reconnoitring various parts of\r\nthe city, as far as circumstances admitted, and all returned in the\r\nevening to Hong-kong in the same gun-boat which had conveyed them to\r\nCanton.\r\n\r\nWhile we were lying at anchor in Hong-kong, an extra sheet of the \"_North\r\nChina Herald_,\" published at Shanghai, brought intelligence of a treaty of\r\npeace having been signed at Tien-Tsin, by Lord Elgin, on the part of\r\nEngland, and the Imperial Commissioners, and that it had been dispatched\r\nto Pekin for the purpose of being ratified by the imperial autograph. This\r\ntreaty, which contained 56 clauses, invested England with far more\r\nextensive rights than she had hitherto possessed. Especially it was\r\nstipulated that an English ambassador should reside in a palace at Pekin,\r\nand be accorded all the honours due to his rank, and that the Christian\r\nreligion should be professed and taught without any restrictions. British\r\nsubjects, provided with passes from their own consuls, to be countersigned\r\nby the local Chinese authorities, were to be permitted to traverse the\r\nempire in every direction on business or pleasure; the navigation of the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang, or Blue River, was also declared free; and in addition to\r\nthe five harbours already opened to foreign commerce by the treaty of\r\nNankin, the English were now to be at liberty to trade with New-Chwang,\r\nTang-Char, Tai-Wan (on the island of Formosa), Chau-Chow, and Kiung-Chow\r\n(in Hainan), to settle in any of these, to buy and sell house property,\r\nas also to erect churches and hospitals, and lay out cemeteries. Chinese\r\nsubjects guilty of crimes or offences against the English, to be punished\r\nby the native authorities in conformity with the law of the land. English\r\nsubjects, on the other hand, to be subject to the jurisdiction of the\r\nBritish authorities, in similar circumstances, and treated according to\r\nBritish law. All official communications on the part of the English\r\nauthorities to be drawn up in English for presentation to the Chinese\r\nGovernment, and although, for the present, accompanied by a translation,\r\nshall in the event of uncertainty be construed according to the text of\r\nthe English original. Article L provides that the symbol [Chinese\r\ncharacter(s)] (Barbarian) shall be discontinued in all official documents,\r\nwhether in the capital or the provinces, and the term \"English\" or\r\n\"English Government\" be substituted. On the other hand, the Treaty of\r\nTien-Tsin is silent on the subject of the opium trade, the main point in\r\ndispute, the prime cause of the various wars hitherto broken out! There\r\nwas mention made of a revision of the tariff only. Obviously the British\r\nplenipotentiaries thought they would more readily attain their object if\r\nthey endeavoured to get this difficult question solved in some less\r\nconspicuous manner. The opium merchants, as well as their antagonists the\r\nLondon philanthropists, seemed equally dissatisfied that the opium matter\r\nwas still left a \"pending question.\" On the whole, however, this was one\r\nof the most marked diplomatic peculiarities of the Treaty of Tien-Tsin.\r\nInstead of rousing anew the passions of the Chinese, and, by wringing such\r\nan open and public concession from that Government, weakening still more\r\nthe hold of the Emperor over his own people, and, whatever their\r\nprofessions of amity, rendering the authorities yet more hostile and\r\nrancorous against the foreigners, the wily English ambassador preferred\r\nquietly to include opium amongst the other articles of import under the\r\nrevised tariff, and thus convert it into a common article of import.\r\nAccordingly, opium, like cotton, hides, and stockfish, may now be imported\r\nat a fixed duty of 30 _taels_ (L8 15_s._) per _picul_ of 100 _catties_\r\n(133-1/2 lbs.).\r\n\r\nThe events of which China was the scene shortly after the signature of the\r\ntreaty, the hostilities of the troops in the Taku forts, the desperate\r\nresistance which was made to the advance of the British ambassador, when\r\nthe latter, agreeably to the stipulations in the new treaty, was preparing\r\nto travel to Pekin, all combine to prove that, in their professions of\r\npeace and friendliness, the Chinese were not in earnest.\r\n\r\nSince that period an army of 20,000 Europeans has dictated a peace to\r\n400,000,000 Asiatics, and their till then deemed impregnable capital; and\r\non 24th October, 1860, Lord Elgin countersigned a new treaty, which,\r\ntogether with the clauses contained in the previous Treaty of Tien-Tsin\r\ndrawn up two years before, provides for the permanent residence of a\r\nBritish ambassador in the capital of the Chinese Empire, as also for a war\r\nindemnity of 8,000,000 _taels_ (L2,333,333); throws open the harbour of\r\nTien-Tsin to foreign commerce, permits Chinese subjects to emigrate,\r\nwithout any restrictions, to any part of the British colonies, and to take\r\nservice there; assigns to Great Britain a portion of the district of\r\nKow-loang or Cow-loon on the mainland opposite Hong-kong; and, finally,\r\nordains that the original treaty, and all the various additional articles,\r\nshall be published by placard in every part of the Empire. Never before\r\nhad the Middle Kingdom sustained such a humiliation. True, during the rule\r\nof the former dynasty, Tao-Kwang (Light of Reason), an end was put to a\r\nsystem that had endured for a thousand years, but conditions such as those\r\nthat had been imposed by the western nations in the treaties of Tien-Tsin\r\nand Pekin, were altogether unheard of in the history of China, and afford\r\nconvincing proof of its weakness and approaching downfal, the more so, as\r\nthe late Emperor Hien-fung was a jealous upholder of the old Asiatic\r\ndoctrines and state craft. Only the utmost necessity and unceasing\r\npressure could have induced him to lower his arms before the barbarians of\r\nthe west, and to endure that an enemy should have dictated conditions of\r\npeace in his own capital, hitherto inaccessible to foreign nations.\r\nEnglish, French, and American ships of war hold possession of the most\r\nimportant forts of China. In several provinces of the interior, a rebel\r\nemperor has set up his camp, while on the banks of the Amoor, on the north\r\nof the Empire, Russia is building fortresses, and acting as if she were\r\nquite at home in that region. But all these phenomena, however divergent\r\nthe interests, may at present point to one stupendous result,--rousing\r\nthe immense Chinese Empire from its thousand years' lethargy, and forcing\r\nthe natives who populate it to follow in the great onward career of\r\ncivilization, which in our days is rushing with the rapidity of a tempest\r\nthrough the world!\r\n\r\nWhile the Commodore and some of his staff were proceeding to Canton in the\r\ngun-boat, the naturalists made an excursion to the Portuguese settlement\r\nof Macao, about 35 miles distant from Hong-kong, with which there is\r\nbi-weekly communication by an English steamer. Usually this voyage\r\noccupies from four to five hours, but the _Sir Charles Forbes_ was a small\r\nslow-going tub, and as our departure was delayed several hours in\r\nconsequence of a large shipment of chests of opium, for which it was hoped\r\na better price would be obtained at Macao, and as we had on our way\r\nthither to contend with rain, squalls, and contrary winds, it was dark ere\r\nwe reached Macao.\r\n\r\nWe were not a little taken aback at finding several of the passengers\r\narmed with revolvers. However, these seemingly superfluous precautions\r\nagainst danger in a pleasure sail of a few hours were well founded. Not\r\nlong before, it had happened that the European passengers to Macao had\r\nbeen assailed by the Chinese on board, and all murdered in cold blood! the\r\nChinese had stealthily watched for the moment when the captain and\r\npassengers were at table in the confined cabin of the little craft, took\r\npossession of the vessel, and murdered every European on board. The\r\ncaptain and some of the passengers sprang overboard to save their lives,\r\nbut only one man, an Englishman, succeeded in effecting his escape, and\r\ngiving intelligence of this terrible affair. After they had possessed\r\nthemselves of a considerable booty, the pirates set the vessel on fire,\r\nand set at nought all efforts to bring them to punishment by escaping into\r\nthe interior of the country.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for paying passage-money, expenses, &c., are apt to\r\nstrike a stranger as singular. Gold is absolutely out of use, and the\r\ncurrent coins, such as Mexican dollars, and copper money, or cash, are too\r\nbulky to admit of their being lugged about to pay large amounts. In order\r\nto provide for the expenses of a pleasure party of a couple of days it\r\nwould be necessary to take a large bag, which there was the further danger\r\nmight disappear somewhere without hands. An excellent arrangement has\r\naccordingly been introduced, by which each passenger pays his fare and\r\nother expenses, by means of a check on any one of the mercantile houses in\r\nMacao or Hong-kong, which is filled up with the entire amount for\r\ncollection by the controller, and is cashed on his return. This custom is\r\nalso a remarkable example of mutual confidence in public life, even if it\r\nbe explained by the fact that the majority of the passengers are well\r\nknown, and that China has as yet only been frequented by well-off\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nThe passage from Hong-kong to Macao is not entirely devoid of interest.\r\nThe course of the steamer lies at first among narrow canals, between\r\nlofty granite rocks: so soon as she emerges from these, the muddy\r\ndisturbed colour of the water indicates that she is now crossing the mouth\r\nof the Canton River proper. Stately ships are seen passing up or down,\r\nwhile junks and fishing-boats are plying on every side. The majestic\r\nconical peak, 3000 feet high, of the island of Lantao, and the Castle Peak\r\nscarred with a deep furrow from top to bottom, on the mainland of the\r\nprovince of Quang-tong directly opposite, form the background. The\r\nregularity of the conical shape in these peaks, which seems to point to\r\ntheir being of volcanic origin, renders it probable that they are either\r\ngranite or porphyritic in structure. The mouth of the Canton River is so\r\nwide, that the opposing shores only gradually become visible, the wide\r\nexpanse of water, extending on every side till lost in the horizon, giving\r\nthe traveller the impression that he is on the open sea.\r\n\r\nAlready, before the houses of Macao could be very easily made out, we\r\npassed the merchant ships lying in the roads, which cannot approach within\r\nfrom six to eight nautical miles. The small thoroughly land-locked \"inner\r\nharbour,\" as it is called, lying on the other side of the narrow tongue of\r\nland on which Macao is situate, is only accessible for small vessels and\r\nChinese junks, which visit it in large numbers.\r\n\r\nThe first view of the city of Macao is not less charming than that of\r\nVictoria. The long ranges of houses are picturesquely grouped around the\r\nnumerous little hills surmounted by forts, which form the greater part of\r\nthe isthmus; while the beautiful Praya Grande, where palaces and imposing\r\nmansions are disposed in long array close along the shore, in order to get\r\nthe benefit of the refreshing sea-breezes, makes a deep and lasting\r\nimpression upon the stranger. Churches with lofty double towers shooting\r\ninto the air, and the vast dome of the Jesuit College, at once single the\r\ncity out as Catholic, and impart to its external aspect a strong contrast\r\nwith the adjoining English colony.\r\n\r\nMacao is a favourite resort of the foreigners settled in Hong-kong for\r\nchange of air, which in these latitudes seems to be even more necessary\r\nthan in Europe. So long as Canton was the chief seat of the European\r\ntraders, the Portuguese settlement was used by them as a summer residence\r\nfor their families, whither they could themselves occasionally retire from\r\nthe bustle of Canton, and the attendant insecurity of life, to spend a few\r\ndays of calm enjoyment with their families. On account of the alarms of\r\nwar of the previous year, most of the Canton merchants had come down to\r\nHong-kong and Macao to settle, in consequence of which the latter town has\r\nan unusually lively appearance, while its trade, which had previously been\r\nin a rather languishing condition, has materially improved.\r\n\r\nWhen the steamer makes its appearance in the roads of Macao, it is\r\nimmediately surrounded by an innumerable swarm of what are called\r\nTanka-boats, mostly propelled by women, who with yells and shrieks bid for\r\nthe privilege of conveying the passengers to shore. As there is no\r\nsuitable landing-place on the eastern side of the roads, the traveller is\r\nconveyed to the shore through the lash of the waves in a small\r\ncockle-shaped boat, just as at Madeira or Madras, and equally\r\nuncomfortably; but although the boat and the mode in which it is navigated\r\nare anything but calculated to inspire confidence, such a thing as an\r\naccident is of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe naturalists of the _Novara_ found an exceedingly friendly and hearty\r\nreception at the beautiful residence of the Russian Consul, M. Von\r\nCarlowitz, who shortly before had come from Canton to settle in Macao,\r\nwith his excellent wife, a very beautiful lady of Altenburg in Germany,\r\nthere to await the upshot of the war.\r\n\r\nOur first visit the following morning--a bright and beautiful Sabbath\r\nmorning--was to the renowned Camoens Grotto, situated in a large\r\nwell-wooded park, partly covered with primeval forest, the property of a\r\nPortuguese family of the name of Marquez. All around there reigned utter,\r\nalmost sacred silence. Here it was that Camoens, banished from his native\r\nland, wrote his Lusiad. The park with its fragrant shady aisles, its\r\nmajestic leafy domes, impervious even to the rays of the tropical sun, its\r\nhuge piles of rock round which clamber the immense roots of gigantic\r\nfig-trees, its deliciously cool atmosphere, its soft green velvet paths,\r\nits heaps of ruined walls, and its death-like quietness, seems as though\r\ndestined for the asylum of an exiled poet, who, instead of lamenting his\r\ndestiny like common men in sullen silence, felt his spirit roused amid\r\nthis wonderful tropical beauty to fresh sublime efforts,--\"Things\r\nunattempted yet in prose or rhyme!\" In an ill-contrived niche in the\r\nsubstructure of the grotto is a bust, in terra-cotta, of the great poet,\r\nwith the inscription, \"Louis de Camoens, born 1524, died 1579.\" On the\r\nbroad marble pedestal whereon stands this bust, which savours but little\r\nof artistic taste, various verses from the Lusiad have been engraved with\r\nan iron stylus.[120] Formerly this grotto must have had a much more\r\nagreeable appearance, but the present proprietor thought to beautify it by\r\nmaking an addition to it, which has resulted in its having almost entirely\r\nlost its original character. From one point within the grotto, called the\r\nobservatory, and traditionally used as such by Camoens, there is a\r\nbeautiful peep over the inner harbour, with its throng of busy human ants.\r\nQuite close to this singular abode for a poet, is the meeting-house of an\r\nevangelical Christian community, numbering about 200 souls, with a\r\ncemetery attached, which, with its handsome stone monuments and\r\nbeautifully laid-out gardens, constitutes one of the most interesting\r\nplaces of outdoor resort in the colony.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive and important edifice in the settlement of Macao,\r\nfounded in 1563 by the Portuguese, on a peninsula of the same name, about\r\nfive square miles in extent, is the Pagoda of Makok and its different\r\ntemples, situate on the slope of a hill between picturesque groups of\r\ngranite rocks, studded with gigantic Chinese inscriptions and splendid\r\nclumps of trees. At the entrance of this retreat for the gods, is a large\r\nfantastically-adorned Buddhist temple, surrounded by a large number of\r\napartments, in which reside the priests, and where they carry on their\r\nhousehold duties, and prepare tapers and sycee-paper for the worship of\r\ntheir deities, and where are also a few private altars to divinities,\r\nwhose influence and protection the Chinese ladies of doubtful reputation\r\ndo not, it seems, venture publicly to invoke.\r\n\r\nSteps cut in the granite rock conduct to the highest point, about 200 feet\r\nabove sea-level, on which there is likewise a temple. At the time of our\r\nvisit, a number of Buddhist priests in long yellow plaited garments were\r\nascending to the summit, preceded by flute-players, there to perform their\r\ndevotions. On their return they distributed among the poor Chinese\r\ncongregated in the chief apartment of the temple, a large quantity of\r\nfruit and other eatables.\r\n\r\nWhile at Macao we visited one of the most respected of the foreigners\r\nsettled there, Dr. Kane, an English physician, who has for years resided\r\nin the colony. This gentleman was so kind as to present us with the head\r\nof a statue from the renowned nine-storied or Flower Pagoda (Hwa-tah) near\r\nCanton, which during a visit he paid to that half-ruined edifice in March,\r\n1857, he had found lying on the ground, a fragment from a sandstone figure\r\non the seventh story, representing a pupil of Buddha. This Pagoda, 160\r\nfeet high, was constructed upwards of a thousand years since, which must\r\naccordingly be the age of the relic in question.\r\n\r\nThe number of inhabitants at present in Macao amounts to about 97,000, of\r\nwhom 90,000 are Chinese and 7000 Portuguese and Mestizoes. Of other\r\nforeign nations there are but a very few in the peninsula. The chief\r\narticle of commerce in the colony is opium, which finds its way hence into\r\nthe interior in large quantities. Hong-kong is in too close proximity, is\r\ntoo favourably situated, and is inhabited by too energetic a race, to\r\nadmit of Macao, especially so long as it remains in the hands of the\r\nPortuguese, recovering its former commercial importance. Portugal derives\r\nbut little profit from her colonies, and it is only national pride that\r\nwill not hear of this possession, which is more a burden than a source of\r\naid to the mother country, being disposed of by way of sale to either the\r\nEnglish or the North Americans. However, the maintenance of this colony\r\ncosts the Portuguese home Government but little, as the colonists support\r\nthe chief expenses themselves. Thus the pay of the Governor, who receives\r\nL1260 per annum, as also that of the military force of about 400 men, and\r\nof a small ship stationed in the harbour, are all defrayed by the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nMacao is at present the chief point for the shipment of Chinese labourers\r\nor coolies to the West Indies. There are above 10,000 Chinese annually\r\nwhom hunger and want drive to sell themselves virtually as slaves to the\r\ntraders in human flesh, to drag out a miserable existence far from home.\r\nThey are chiefly sent from Macao to the Havanna. We visited the house in\r\nwhich these pitiable objects are confined till the departure of the ship;\r\nwe saw the haggard, reckless look of these wretched beings, who, despite\r\nthe dreadful fate that awaits them, hire themselves out to Portuguese and\r\nSpanish kidnappers. In return for a free passage to Havanna, they bind\r\nthemselves to work for eight years after their arrival with whatever\r\nmaster is found for them at four dollars a month,[121] a rate of wage very\r\nmuch lower than that paid to the labourer of the country, or even to the\r\nmanumitted slave. This immense difference however does not accrue so much\r\nto the West India planter as to the speculators who are engaged in the\r\nimportation of Chinese, for each of whom a large premium is paid. The\r\nvoyage, which usually lasts from four to five months and costs about L70 a\r\nhead, is chiefly carried on in French, Portuguese, and--alas! that it\r\nshould be so--English and German ships. What sufferings the unhappy\r\nemigrants are exposed to during the voyage, appears from the fact that a\r\nnumber of them not unfrequently jump overboard, to seek a refuge from\r\ntheir misery under the waves. Cases have been known in which, owing to\r\nhard fare and mismanagement, 38 per cent. of the emigrants have died on\r\nthe passage![122]\r\n\r\nThe society which takes charge of this trade in exporting men is known as\r\nthe _Colonisadora_, and has its head-quarters in the Havanna. Each Chinese\r\nmust before leaving Macao subscribe a contract which is for the exclusive\r\nbenefit of the society, and by which the poor emigrants explicitly\r\nrenounce all the advantage they might derive from certain paragraphs in\r\nthe Spanish Emigration Act, passed in 1854, which bear upon the\r\ninterpretation of such contracts. As it is usually only the very poorest,\r\nmost shiftless, and most ignorant class that emigrates, the contract is\r\nenforced without the smallest scruple, and if afterwards the emigrant in\r\nthe foreign country becomes aware of the privations and oppression he has\r\nto submit to in comparison with other workers, the obligations he has\r\nentered into are made use of to invoke the protection of the Spanish\r\nauthorities.[123] The fact however that these latter secretly favour the\r\nobjections of the colonization society, sufficiently proves that the\r\ninterests of a social class and the extension of the labour market in the\r\nisland are considered by them as of far higher importance than the good of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nTo the English Government is due the credit of having initiated an\r\nenergetic protest against this trade in human beings, and of having taken\r\nsuch steps as tend to mitigate the evil consequences which cannot but\r\nresult from such a system of deportation. Its representative at the\r\nHavanna, Mr. Crawford, was the first and indeed only individual who\r\nventured to make representations to the Spanish Government as to the\r\nlittle humanity shown for these poor Chinese emigrants, and to draw public\r\nattention to the system.[124] Under a humane and well-managed\r\nadministration of the emigration system in China, it might prove of\r\nimmense service to those countries which are eager to absorb labour, as,\r\nowing to the super-abundance of labour in China, a far larger supply as\r\nwell as a much higher class of labourers might be procured.\r\n\r\nM. de Carlowitz was so kind as to accompany us in our various rambles to\r\nthe more interesting sights and points of view, and more especially when\r\nwe were busied \"doing\" the \"lines\" of the city. On an eminence in the\r\nsuburbs, about 200 feet high, is what is known as Monte fort, garrisoned\r\nby 150 men, whence there is a charming panorama, and the eye catches sight\r\nof the Chinese village of Whang-hia, at the period of our visit most\r\nhostilely disposed, and where on July 3rd, 1844, the first treaty of\r\npeace, friendship, and commerce, was drawn up and signed between China and\r\nthe United States. Another hill, about 300 feet high, at the outer\r\nextremity of the peninsula, on which many years ago the Portuguese had\r\nerected a fort, of which only the foundations can now be traced, commands\r\nthe tongue of land on which stands the city, as well as all the eastern\r\nportion of the island, and amply repays the trouble of ascent. On the road\r\nthither, by which the communication with the mainland of China is mainly\r\ncarried on, we came upon the corpse of a coolie, which had apparently lain\r\nfor several days in the very middle of the road. A part of the head and\r\nthe right hand had been already stripped of the flesh by the\r\ncarrion-crows, and enormous swarms of insects had fastened on the upper\r\nportions of the naked horribly swollen dead body. The miserable being had\r\nobviously fallen a victim to want and destitution. His strength seemed to\r\nhave failed him while he was earning his miserable subsistence, as two\r\nempty broken panniers were lying close beside him. Crowds of people were\r\npassing daily, men, women, children, even Portuguese taking their\r\ncustomary promenade on foot or on horseback, without any person giving\r\nhimself the least trouble to remove the shocking spectacle. Even the\r\nrepresentations of the foreign consuls seem to have but little influence\r\non the Portuguese authorities in these matters, and it appears that it is\r\nby no means an infrequent occurrence to see dead bodies lying about. A\r\nhardly less sickening spectacle was presented on the slope of the hill,\r\nwhere were erected a couple of dozen of small, wretched, filthy huts of\r\npalm-straw, which served for the reception of a number of sick and lepers,\r\nwho, shunned and abandoned by all the world, were sinking in their misery\r\ninto the grave. Leprosy is regarded by the Chinese as a punishment for\r\nsecret sins, and those visited with it are accordingly deprived of all\r\nassistance or attention. Very probably this coolie, whose body we thus saw\r\nlying on the road, was one of those unfortunates who were here digging, as\r\nit were, their own graves.\r\n\r\nThe isthmus which unites the Portuguese settlement on the peninsula with\r\nthe mainland, is barely a quarter of a mile in length by 500 feet in\r\nbreadth. Formerly there was a wall built right across the centre of this\r\ntongue of land, which marked the limit of the colony. Here Chinese\r\nsentinels used to march to and fro to protect the Flowery Kingdom. This,\r\nhowever, did not prevent the \"_Macaoistas_,\" as the inhabitants of Macao\r\nare accustomed to call themselves, from making frequent excursions and\r\npic-nic parties to the mainland and the adjacent Chinese villages. On 22nd\r\nAugust, 1848, however, when the then governor of Macao, Dom Joao Maria\r\nFerreira do Amaral, while riding along the narrow part of the isthmus, was\r\nset upon by a couple of armed Chinese, torn from his horse, and beheaded,\r\nhis skull and hand being carried off by the murderers, the Portuguese\r\npulled down the wall and destroyed the adjoining Chinese fort, so that not\r\na vestige of either now remains. The government of Macao insisted on the\r\nmurderers being delivered up, as also on the restitution of the head and\r\nhand of the victim, but after the lapse of a year the authorities received\r\nan official notification that the murderers had been discovered, and on\r\nconfession of the crime had been executed at Shunteh. The head and hand of\r\nthe unhappy Amaral were delivered to the Portuguese officials by two\r\nChinese commissioners, and solemnly interred with the other remains. In\r\nthe course of the correspondence with reference to this matter[125]\r\nbetween the Chinese and Portuguese authorities, it appeared that, owing to\r\ncertain stringent regulations he had laid down, Governor Amaral had long\r\nbeen marked out for destruction by the Chinese population of Macao. The\r\nchief complaint against him was that he had profaned the graves of their\r\nancestors in the suburbs of Macao, and had constructed new streets right\r\nthrough them. Every attack of illness, every unlucky speculation, every\r\nunexpected mischance, which happened to any of the Chinese residents in\r\nMacao, was ascribed to the vengeance of those spirits, whose repose had\r\nbeen so wantonly violated for such an insignificant purpose. The Chinese\r\nhave no regular cemeteries for their dead. They inter them anywhere about\r\nthe township, simply marking the spot with a stone or an inscription. At\r\nthe new-year's festival these graves are adorned in the most gaudy manner,\r\nnone, not even of the poorest, being neglected in this respect. This pious\r\nfeeling for the dead is in singular and rude contrast with the\r\nindifference with which the Chinese regard the misfortunes of their\r\nneighbours, and the cruelty with which mothers expose their new-born\r\nchildren, or even leave them to die.\r\n\r\nThe trade between Macao and the mainland is very active: in the quarter of\r\nan hour that we were upon the isthmus there passed at least 60 men loaded\r\nwith goods or provisions, moving to and fro to the settlement. Among these\r\nthere were also sedan-chairmen, conveying back to the neighbouring\r\nvillages such of the better class of Chinese as had been doing business in\r\nthe city. The effect of warlike rumours from Canton and the Pei-ho had\r\nmeanwhile become apparent among the European population of Macao. The\r\ninsecurity of life and property increased daily. No one could venture to\r\ngo a mile or two beyond the city. Even a beautiful pic-nic house, erected\r\nby the foreigners on \"Green Island,\" close by the town, whither during\r\npeaceful times frequent excursions were made by European residents with\r\ntheir families, had been for months empty and gutted.\r\n\r\nThe Praya Grande, or rather the shady promenade, at its eastern extremity\r\nserves as a rendezvous for the gay world, and on Sundays, when a band of\r\nmusic plays here, one can scarcely pass through the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese, who even in their native country are not a handsome race,\r\nlose still more in their physical qualities by the unscrupulous manner in\r\nwhich they cross with the native races. This circumstance makes the\r\ncontrast still more apparent of simple, graceful, pale ladies of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race, who now and then appear between the ugly dark natives.\r\nIn the evening, towards sunset, these lovely creatures make their\r\nappearance in their sedan or other chairs in the Campo San Francisco,\r\nthere to enjoy the cool evening sea-breezes. A great number of sedan\r\nporters halt here with their precious burdens, and elegantly-attired\r\ncavaliers saunter about, striving by amiable phrases and flattering\r\nremarks to elicit a smile. While these vehicles form the commonest mode of\r\nconveyance, we also saw there but few saddle-horses, and only one single\r\ncarriage, the property of a rich brownish native, baronized for the amount\r\nof 40,000 dollars, and who thought by this means to display his taste,\r\nhis luxury, and his nobility!\r\n\r\nWe had heard so much of certain wonderful singing stones, on a large\r\nisland opposite the inner part of the harbour, that several of our party\r\nmade an excursion thither. Neither natives nor indeed Europeans could give\r\nus any explanation of this singular phenomenon, but all hold that the\r\nstones must contain metal in some certain proportion, while electricity\r\nand magnetism would do the rest. The naturalists were accompanied to this\r\nmysterious spot by M. Von Carlowitz, Dr. Kane, and a Chinese physician,\r\nDr. Wong-fun. The estimable and highly-educated Wong-fun had graduated as\r\nDoctor of Medicine in the University of Edinburgh, and had afterwards\r\nenlarged his experience by practising some time in the United States,\r\nsince which he had practised the healing art with great success upon his\r\nown countrymen. A European in intelligence and education, he was still a\r\nChinese in external appearance, and wore, as formerly, a long tail.\r\nProbably Wong-fun adhered to this ancient custom in order the more readily\r\nto indoctrinate his fellow-countrymen with European ideas.\r\n\r\nSome small Tanka-boats, in which, as already mentioned, only two persons\r\ncan be accommodated at once, and which are exclusively managed by women,\r\nconveyed our party over the bosom of the inner harbour to the opposite\r\nshore. We then proceeded through a beautiful valley, covered with rice\r\nfields, and traversed in its entire extent by a mountain torrent, which\r\nis dammed off, and drives a number of Chinese mills with the small\r\nwater-courses. In the background of this valley lies the mysterious spot.\r\nThe marvel itself presently became visible in a large expanse of syenite\r\nrock, greatly resembling that in the Oderwald of Hesse. Some of these have\r\nbeen tilted on the others, and the hard syenite resounds when struck with\r\na hammer, just as a block of marble or basalt vibrates when struck, with a\r\nbell-like sound. These musical blocks therefore are but little\r\ninteresting, unless that the Chinese make use of them to sculpture the\r\nfigures of lions and tigers to adorn the entrances of their temples.\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of two days in Macao, the naturalists returned to Hong-kong,\r\nwhere they had to devote the little time that would elapse ere the frigate\r\nsailed to sorting and packing the collections, and arranging for their\r\ntransmission: for the manipulation of packing is, as Humboldt well\r\nremarked, as important as actual science in such undertakings. That\r\nnaturalist confers but a small boon on science, whose only care is to\r\ncollect, but who takes no pains to preserve, the fruits of his labour, by\r\nan exact indication of the place where found, and such special particulars\r\nas may prevent mistakes, and by carefully guarding against damage to the\r\nobjects about to be sent, while on their way.\r\n\r\nThe kind reception and hospitality of our new friends in Hong-kong\r\nremained undiminished to the very last moment of our stay. We were fairly\r\noverwhelmed with attentions of all sorts, each apparently striving to\r\nmake us forget the unfavourable circumstances under which we visited the\r\nEmpire of China.\r\n\r\nThe steamer _Hong-kong_, early on the morning of 18th July, towed us out\r\nthrough the narrow Eastern Straits, the Ly-e-num Pass, and the\r\nTa-thong-wun Channel, into the open sea. As we passed alongside the\r\nEnglish frigate _Nankin_, carrying the broad pendant of the amiable and\r\nexcellent Commodore Stewart, our band played \"God save the Queen,\" while\r\nthe English ensign was dipped, by way of parting salute. A little further\r\non the Chinese Comprador, who had supplied the _Novara_ with provisions\r\ndaily during her stay, had stationed himself in his boat to give us a\r\nparting farewell with a roar of gong-gong, while innumerable rockets\r\nwhizzed and exploded in the air.\r\n\r\nWe found a tolerably high sea outside, but a fine fresh S.W. breeze, under\r\nwhich we rapidly increased our distance from the shore. In like manner as\r\nwhen we entered, we had now in getting out to thread our way among\r\nthousands of fishing-boats sailing about in couples, which cruise about to\r\na distance of even 50 and 60 miles to sea. The steamer which towed us\r\nthrough the narrow Eastern Channel, and had us just four hours and twenty\r\nminutes in tow, charged the amount of 300 dollars (L63), so that each\r\nminute of towing cost rather over one dollar. After making a tack towards\r\nLemma Island, in order to avoid the dangerous Nine-pin rock, the wind\r\nsprung up from E.S.E., so that we were enabled to lie our proper course,\r\nand by sundown had cleared _Piedra bianca_.\r\n\r\nWith fine weather and a fresh S.W. monsoon our voyage was so speedy, that\r\nby 2nd July we were in the latitude of Formosa, but without being able to\r\ndistinguish the high land, either on the Chinese coast or on that island,\r\nand by 23rd July we were off the Saddle Islands, at the mouth of the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang.\r\n\r\nJust as we reached this, the door, as it were, through which we had to\r\nenter, the weather chose to change with the utmost suddenness. Calms and\r\ncontrary winds, coupled with the powerful current of the mighty river,\r\nsweeping through the islands, prevented our further advance, and on the\r\n24th we had to cast anchor near the easternmost Saddle Island. Close to us\r\non every side were numbers of other ships equally unfortunate with\r\nourselves, while the spectacle of the steamers, pursuing their course\r\nwithout feeling any obstruction, filled us with envy. We had taken a\r\nChinese pilot on board, and by 25th July were in sight of Gutzlaff, a\r\nsmall islet of rock 210 feet high, the best land-mark of the \"Son of\r\nOcean,\" and just before sunset anchored off the outer bar. We now had fair\r\nbreezes, and without further obstacles passed over the bar in from 30 to\r\n33 feet water, which in bad weather, however, is exceedingly dangerous. We\r\nwere still out of sight of land; even the islands we had already passed\r\nsank below the horizon, and still there was nothing visible but an\r\nunbroken expanse of yellowish-red water, which reflected with the utmost\r\nbrilliancy the rays of the sun. A light-ship moored to a sand-bank, and a\r\nwreck on another sand-bank, are, after leaving Gutzlaff Island, the sole\r\nland-marks by which the pilot can hope to keep the channel, which is only\r\nfrom one to two miles wide in this vast shoreless river estuary. Indeed\r\nthe entrance of the Yang-tse-Kiang is regarded as one of the most\r\ndifficult feats for a large ship. With favourable wind and weather, the\r\n_Novara_ cleared without accident the 47 miles between the bar and the\r\nplace where the Wusung falls into the Yang-tse-Kiang, and on the evening\r\nof the 26th July dropped anchor in front of Wusung. The navigation\r\npresented little that was interesting, yet each man involuntarily felt a\r\nthrill as he reflected that he was sailing in the current of the longest\r\nriver in China, whose source lies thousands of miles inland at Khukkunor,\r\namong the Mangolians.\r\n\r\nAs we neared Wusung, signs of life began to be visible on the river\r\nitself; tall three-masters were passing, bound in or out, and scores of\r\nChinese junks with their peculiar rig and build. Far above the light-ship\r\nthe shore first became visible, low, flat, scarcely above the level of the\r\nriver, but green and fertile. A Pagoda of the well-known form of the\r\nPorcelain tower of Nankin and a few lofty trees enable the pilot to take\r\nthe bearings of the channel at this point. Only the land on the left is\r\nactual mainland, the shore on the right being the coast of the island of\r\nTsuning, lying at the mouth of the river. At the mouth of the Wusung, this\r\nsouthern arm of the Yang-tse-Kiang, as formed by the above-named island,\r\nis about six and a half nautical miles in width, and a little higher up is\r\nfurther narrowed by Bush Island to a width of four miles.\r\n\r\nThe first inhabited spot at the junction of the Wusung and Yang-tse-Kiang\r\nis the wretched filthy village of Wusung, which owes its importance solely\r\nand exclusively to the opium boats, which the merchants of Hong-kong and\r\nShanghai used to station here in the stream, in order more readily to sell\r\nand deliver to the Chinese that forbidden article. Thus the natives took\r\non themselves the responsibility of opium smuggling, while the foreign\r\nmerchants became thereby involved in a conflict with the Chinese\r\nGovernment. The opium sold per month from the ships stationed at Wusung\r\namounts to from 2500 to 2800 chests, in value about 500 _taels_ (L150) per\r\nchest (L375,000 to L420,000).\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Wusung is the entrance to Shanghai, which lies about 12\r\nmiles up the Wusung or Shanghai river, but in consequence of a mud-bank is\r\nonly accessible to large ships at spring-tide. Nankin lies up the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang 180 miles from Shanghai, the channel being so deep that\r\neven a frigate may sail close up under its walls. Six hundred miles\r\ndistant from the embouchure of the Wusung lie the three immense cities of\r\nWu-chang, Hang-iang, and Shan-Keu, containing 8,000,000 inhabitants, the\r\ncentral point of the internal commerce of China; and about 400 miles\r\nfurther up are the first rapids of the Yang-tse-Kiang, which completely\r\nprevent all further navigation. Up to this point the mighty river, like\r\nthe Mississippi, the Rhine, or the Danube, may be navigated by river\r\nsteamers, without the slightest danger or difficulty. What an enormous\r\ntrade, what a tremendous development, will ere long be witnessed here, so\r\nsoon as, in accordance with the stipulations of the Tien-Tsin and Pekin\r\ntreaties, English ships, freighted with goods and necessaries of all\r\nsorts, shall steam up this most splendid of rivers and its tributaries,\r\nand the inhabitants of the far interior shall become acquainted with the\r\nproducts of European industry, and in exchange shall export to Europe\r\ninnumerable articles of new and valuable trade. For it is the greatest\r\nservice of the merchant that he not alone opens new channels of commerce,\r\nand by increased exportation of the fabrics of his native land tends to\r\nbuild up his power, but that he civilizes foreign nations, and enriches\r\nscience and industry with innumerable fresh acquisitions.\r\n\r\nThe larger ships usually lie at anchor at the little Chinese village of\r\nWusung on the river of that name, just where it falls into the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang, and here accordingly, owing to the hostilities, we found\r\nupwards of twenty ships of war of various nationalities at anchor. Among\r\nothers the powerful American steam-ship _Minnesota_, and the French\r\nfrigates _Audacieuse_ and _Nemesis_, an imposing spectacle in these\r\ndistant regions, and to which the half-ruined Chinese fort on the tongue\r\nof land between the Wusung and the Yang-tse-Kiang, with its couple of\r\nwretched cannon, presented a tragi-comic contrast. Numbers of Chinese\r\nboats, from the smallest cloth-awning _sampan_ propelled by one man with a\r\npaddle to the large junk with fifteen masts, and sentences painted along\r\nthe bends, were cruising in every direction. Ere long a Comprador found\r\nhis way on board, who according to custom undertook to provide the frigate\r\nwith everything she required.\r\n\r\nCommodore Wuellerstorff purposed proceeding with the frigate to Shanghai;\r\nbut as it would be necessary to wait for a fair wind, or else to engage\r\nanother steam-tug, implying a delay of several days, the naturalists were\r\npermitted to avail themselves of the opportunity offered by the\r\nComprador's boat to proceed at once to Shanghai, which voyage we were two\r\nhours and a half in performing.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of European merchantmen that we passed, some lying at\r\nanchor in front of Wusung, others sailing up or down stream, was quite\r\nsurprising, yet the sight of the river at Shanghai far surpassed all\r\nexpectation. Here, close packed together in a channel rather narrower than\r\nelsewhere, was drawn up tier after tier of shipping, a quite impervious\r\nforest of masts, athwart which at intervals the large warehouses of the\r\nEuropean merchants indistinctly loomed, lining the banks on either side.\r\nThe newspaper lists at the time of our visit gave the names of no less\r\nthan 102 large American and European merchantmen in the Shanghai River, in\r\naddition to which there were upwards of a thousand native junks lying in\r\nthe stream with their short crooked masts, the most convincing evidence of\r\nthe commercial importance which this place has attained within the short\r\nspace of time that has elapsed since by the Treaty of Nankin in 1842\r\nforeign factories were authorized to be erected here.\r\n\r\nOn the shore the flags of the Consulates of the more important sea-faring\r\nnations fluttered gaily in the breeze from lofty flag-staffs on the top of\r\nthe imposing buildings. Hardly had we landed ere we were surrounded by an\r\nungainly crowd of Chinese coolies, who with their bamboo staves began such\r\na serious battle among themselves for the right of carrying our baggage,\r\nthat it was only by the interposition of the police that several were not\r\nleft on the spot severely wounded.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence that there was in Shanghai not a single house of\r\nentertainment, such as we understand by the name of \"hotel\" in Europe, was\r\nthe less agreeable, as the dwellings of the resident Europeans, where,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, strangers are received with the utmost\r\nhospitality, happened at present to be occupied by the officers of the\r\nnumerous war-ships, as well as by members of the two embassies. The only\r\nplace where we could be received was what is known as the Union Hotel, a\r\nden in the fullest sense of the word, in which we passed one of the most\r\nuncomfortable nights we ever remember. Myriads of mosquitoes, the true\r\nblood-thirsty \"gallinipper,\" loud-shouting drunken seamen, dogs howling,\r\nintolerable heat, which not even a tremendous thunder-storm that broke\r\nforth during the night could assuage,--such were some of the amenities of\r\nour reception, which, despite our exhaustion, utterly precluded sleep.\r\nWith unspeakable longing we watched for the dawn of the morning, and,\r\nthanks to the hospitality of our new friends, we were in the course of the\r\nday fortunate enough to be released from this hideous abode.\r\n\r\nThe _Novara_ did not remain long behind us. A few days later, on 29th\r\nJuly, she sailed gallantly up in an hour and a half, from Wusung, on the\r\ntop of a spring-tide, and with favourable breezes, and on reaching\r\nShanghai was welcomed with pride and delight by the German residents\r\nhere--the first ship-of-war of a first-class German power that had ever\r\nbeen seen in the river Wusung.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] The analysis of these hieroglyphics, by which abstract ideas are\r\nsought to be expressed, is extremely interesting. Thus a heart with the\r\nbadge of slavery over it represents \"anger;\" a hand, and the sign for the\r\nmiddle, signifies an \"historian,\" because it is his duty not to lean to\r\neither side; by the sign of uprightness and motion is represented\r\n\"government,\" because it must always observe probity in the transaction of\r\naffairs; to indicate the idea of a \"friend\" two pearls are represented\r\nside by side, because friendship is as rare as two pearls, exactly\r\nresembling each other! The well-known French missionary Huc, in his\r\nvaluable work on the Chinese Empire, gives a variety of most interesting\r\nparticulars respecting the Chinese language.\r\n\r\n[113] A very abstruse treatise upon the preparation of the Chinese ink is\r\ncontained in the important labours of the Russian Embassy at Pekin,\r\nrelating to China, published in German by Dr. Abel and Mecklenburg,\r\nBerlin, F. Heinike, 1858, vol. ii. p. 481. The information is borrowed\r\nfrom a small treatise which was written in 1398 by a certain\r\nScheu-zsi-Sun, who had been for thirty years engaged in the fabrication of\r\nthe India ink. The author therein mentions how, after he had tried every\r\nknown method, and every substance usually employed, without attaining any\r\nresult, he at last put them all on one side, mingling only pin-soot with\r\nglue together, and diluting this mixture with but hot water, again kneaded\r\nit thoroughly, and thus succeeded in getting an ink \"black and lustrous as\r\na child's eyes.\" According to another method, India ink is prepared,\r\nbesides pin-soot and lime, of a sort of tincture, consisting of the\r\nfollowing various pigments,--pomegranate-rind, sandal-wood, sulphate of\r\niron and copper, gamboge, cinnobar, dragon's-blood, gold-leaf, musk, and\r\nglair. This tint is said to be remarkable for preventing the glue from\r\ngetting spoiled by age, or the colour changing, and may be thus kept for\r\nany length of time. 1/2 lb. of glue and 1/4 lb. of this colouring matter\r\nare the proportions for one pound of pin-soot. However, only a very small\r\nportion of the different materials used seems to possess the power\r\nascribed to them, and many are used out of mere prejudice, and not at all\r\nto the advantage of the ink prepared.\r\n\r\n[114] This custom is of remote antiquity in Oriental countries, as witness\r\nthe circumstances attending the birth of Ishmael, and also of several of\r\nthe children of Israel.\r\n\r\n[115] Many European residents at Hong-kong and Shanghai have Chinese\r\nmistresses _bought_ in this way, who are bound to live with them only so\r\nlong as their masters choose.\r\n\r\n[116] The title of this work is:--\"_Notices sur le vert de Chine et de la\r\nteinture en vert chez les Chinois, par Natalis Rondot, imprime aux frais\r\nde la Chambre de Commerce de Lyon, a Paris, 1858._\"\r\n\r\n[117] The Chinese of Shanghai called the plant _Li-lu-schu_, and the\r\nsubstance obtained from it _Gah-schik_.\r\n\r\n[118] We give the following translation of one of these proclamations:\r\n\"Listen, O listen, ye detestable barbarians! We, patriots and honourable\r\nsubjects of the reigning dynasty, wish to hold up a mirror to you, that ye\r\nmay see what ye are doing, and what like you are! Only in speech, and in\r\nno other respect, do ye differ from wild beasts! We have understanding, we\r\nobserve laws and commandments; but you are blind and dumb, and will not\r\nreceive advice. You must--there is nothing else for it--you _must_ be cut\r\noff to the very last man!... Since you first came to the MIDDLE KINGDOM,\r\nyou have done all that you can to destroy us; you have shot at us from\r\nyour ships; you have poisoned us with opium, you have erected devils'\r\nhouses (churches) within the walls of the city! Nay more, in order to hold\r\nyour horse-races, you have profaned graves, and not suffered the dead to\r\nrest in peace! Insatiable as sharks, greedy as a set of silk-worms upon a\r\nmulberry tree, the more you get the more you want. Even our most trifling\r\nprofit you have taken to yourselves. Now, however, the cup is full, Heaven\r\nin its wrath has decreed your destruction,--our people shall cut you off\r\nwith divine weapons of fire. Hearken now, O people, to the four following\r\nrules for the extermination of the barbarians: All barbarians must be\r\nbeheaded, that our reproach may be removed, and our Middle Kingdom be no\r\nlonger insulted. So runs the order of the leader!--To none other shall any\r\ndisaster happen, no one shall be molested. Whoever strikes back, shall\r\nhimself be struck.... The day of vengeance shall be secretly appointed. We\r\nshall circumvent the barbarians with treachery, we shall fall on them\r\nunawares, and destroy them. Natives who are in the habit of attending\r\ntheir schools, or of serving them, or of trading with them, must leave\r\nthem and return to their old pursuits. If they remain, then the subjects\r\nof the exceedingly beneficent dynasty as well as the barbarians, the\r\ndiamonds and the hailstones, shall be destroyed together.... After the\r\ndestruction of these hideous hordes, their possessions shall be\r\ndistributed among those who have distinguished themselves on the day of\r\nbattle. So runs the order of the leader!\"\r\n\r\n[119] Yeh, as is well known, has since died in imprisonment at Calcutta.\r\n\r\n[120] In front, Canto X. v. 25; XII. vv. 79-80. On the back, Canto VI. vv.\r\n95, 131, and Canto VIII. v. 42.\r\n\r\n[121] Even these four dollars sustain a reduction during the first year,\r\nsince the emigrant must for the first year pay one dollar a month to\r\ndefray necessaries, partly provisions, partly clothes, supplied to him to\r\nthe amount of $12, before his departure.\r\n\r\n[122] J. F. Crawford, Esq., British Consul-General at the Havanna, in an\r\nofficial document respecting the number of Chinese imported in the course\r\nof one year into Havanna proves that in the case of the Peruvian ship\r\n_Cora_, 117 out of 292 coolies perished owing to bad water. In one single\r\nyear (1857) 63 ships, of 43,933 tons, cleared from Chinese ports for the\r\nHavanna, with 23,928 Chinese labourers, of whom 3842, or above 16 per\r\ncent., died during the voyage.\r\n\r\n[123] We give in the Appendix the original text of one of these contracts,\r\nwhich the Chinese emigrants have to sign preparatory to their going on\r\nship-board, together with a translation, and shall leave the reader to\r\njudge whether those are very far wrong who denounce the system as but\r\nanother form of slave-trade.\r\n\r\n[124] The cruelty and injustice with which the poor Chinese emigrants are\r\ntreated, have repeatedly had the most appalling consequences. The \"_China\r\nOverland Trade Report_,\" published at Hong-kong, under date 28th February,\r\n1861, gives the particulars of one such tragedy, which had shortly before\r\noccurred on board of one of these emigrant ships. On 22nd February, the\r\nAmerican ship _Leonidas_ sailed from Canton for the Havanna with a number\r\nof coolies on board. Near what is known as the Macao passage, a tremendous\r\nnoise was suddenly heard in the between-decks. Two of the mates, on\r\ndescending to inquire into the cause of the disturbance, were attacked\r\nwith knives and severely wounded. Meanwhile some of the coolies had\r\noverpowered the captain and his wife, and had inflicted on them several\r\ndangerous wounds. However, the crew ultimately succeeded in driving all\r\nthe coolies into the hold, though not till after the 29th had been passed\r\nin constant fighting. In their desperation they sought to set fire to the\r\nship, by preparing a regular pyre of combustibles, to which they set fire.\r\nEre long, however, the smoke became so intolerable in the hold, that they\r\nthemselves speedily made every effort to extinguish the fire. The ship\r\nreturned to Canton. Out of 250 coolies, 94 were dead, of whom some were\r\nshot, some were drowned, some suffocated. Singular to say the French\r\nman-of-war _Durance_ refused to render any assistance. Other accounts\r\nspeak in the highest terms of the efforts of a German missionary to put a\r\nstop to this practice of kidnapping, dignified by the name of emigration,\r\nit having not unfrequently happened that young Chinese were openly carried\r\noff to Macao, and there as openly sold. This is the more readily credible,\r\ninasmuch as the Chinese are most desperate gamblers, and after they have\r\nlost all they possess, think nothing of staking their personal liberty.\r\nThus, a short time since, the son of respectable parents in Sunon was sold\r\nby the Emigration Society at Macao for 40 dols., and it was only by the\r\nmost unremitting efforts of the German missionary already mentioned that\r\nthe wretched lad was re-purchased for L60, and thus escaped a terrible\r\ndestiny. Two other Chinese were shipped at the same time, the bargain in\r\ntheir case being recognized.\r\n\r\n[125] See \"Chinese Repository,\" vol. x., of October, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Flower Boat on the Wusung at Shanghai.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XV.\r\n\r\n                              Shanghai.\r\n\r\n         Duration of Stay from 25th July to 11th August, 1858.\r\n\r\n    A stroll through the old Chinese quarter.--Book-stalls.--Public\r\n    Baths.--Chinese Pawnbrokers.--Foundling hospital.--The Hall of\r\n    Universal Benevolence.--Sacrificial Hall of Medical Faculty.--\r\n    City prison.--Temple of the Goddess of the Sea.--Chinese\r\n    taverns.--Tea-garden.--Temple of Buddha.--Temple of Confucius.--\r\n    Taouist convent.--Chinese nuns.--An apothecary's store, and what\r\n    is sold therein.--Public schools.--Christian places of worship.--\r\n    Native industry.--Cenotaphs to the memory of beneficent\r\n    females.--A Chinese patrician family.--The villas of the foreign\r\n    merchants.--Activity of the London Missionary Society.--Dr.\r\n    Hobson.--Chinese medical works.--Leprosy.--The American\r\n    Missionary Society.--Dr. Bridgman.--Main-tze tribe.--Mission\r\n    schools for Chinese boys and girls.--The North China branch of\r\n    the Royal Asiatic Society.--Meeting in honour of the Members of\r\n    the _Novara_ Expedition.--Mons. de Montigny.--Baron Gros.--\r\n    Interview with the Tau-Tai, or chief Chinese official of the\r\n    city.--The Jesuit mission at Sikkawei.--The Pagoda of Long-Sah.--\r\n    A Chinese dinner.--Serenade by the German singing-club.--The\r\n    Germans in China.--Influence of the Treaties of Tien-Tsin and\r\n    Pekin upon commerce.--Silk.--Tea.--The Chinese sugar-cane.--\r\n    Various species of Bamboos employed in the manufacture of\r\n    paper.--The varnish tree.--The tallow tree.--The wax-tree.--\r\n    Mosquito tobacco.--Articles of import.--Opium.--The Tai-ping\r\n    rebels.--Departure from Shanghai.--A typhoon in the China sea.--\r\n    Sight the island of Puynipet in the Caroline Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\nShanghai, or Shanghai-Hein (the city near the sea), is divided into the\r\nChinese city proper, enclosed within walls twenty-four feet in height,\r\nand the foreign quarter, which has been laid out beyond the walls since\r\nthe year 1843, and is as much distinguished by elegance as by comfort. Old\r\nShanghai, only accessible by three of the six gates with which it is\r\nfurnished, contains 250,000 inhabitants in a superficial area of nine Li,\r\nor about two and one-third English miles, and, including the population of\r\nneighbouring towns, who are constantly flocking to and fro, about 400,000.\r\nThe streets are filthy and singularly narrow, so much so that occasionally\r\nit is difficult for two men to pass each other, the small cross streets\r\nvividly recalling Venice, or the \"lanes\" of London. It is with difficulty,\r\nand only by a constant succession of cries and hearty buffets, that the\r\nbearers of merchandise can force their way through these intricate\r\npassages, and find their way to their destination. The houses, for the\r\nmost part one and two storeys in height, usually consist of shops on the\r\nground-floor, each with a flaming superscription in gigantic characters,\r\nwhich, the better to arrest the curiosity of the passers-by, is generally\r\nhung diagonally across the narrow street. The living throng, which\r\nthroughout the entire day surges to and fro here, is so immense and so\r\nvarious that it leaves upon a stranger an impression even deeper than that\r\nmade by the crowds and bustle of Piccadilly or Regent Street, on a fine\r\nday in the height of \"the season.\" The grotesqueness and filth of almost\r\neverything that meets the eye rather adds to the singularity of the\r\nspectacle, and while the visitor on the one hand speedily finds ample\r\njustification for extricating himself from the din and confusion, he\r\nnevertheless encounters at every step some new object of attraction and\r\nabsorbing interest.\r\n\r\nEntering the city through the east gate, on whose walls, by way of example\r\nto the multitude, are suspended in sacks and wicker-work numerous skulls\r\nof rebels and murderers, on whom justice has been done, we find ourselves\r\nin China street, one of the principal streets of Shanghai, and in which\r\nare most of the best class of native shops. It is however no wider or\r\ncleaner than the other streets of the city, and might be termed a \"lane\"\r\nwith far more propriety than a street. We were conveyed within the lofty,\r\ngloomy \"enceinte\" of the walls in the sedan-chair of the country, after\r\nwhich, under the guidance of Mr. Muirhead, an English missionary, who in\r\nthe kindest manner had offered to be our _cicerone_, we proceeded to\r\nstroll through the town.\r\n\r\nClose to the east gate we entered a book-stall, in which were heaped up\r\nimmense piles of stitched books. A number of Chinese in white nankeen\r\njackets, their foreheads smooth shaved, and each with a \"tail\" behind\r\ndependent to the heels, started forward to inquire the strangers' wants,\r\nand minister to them. Our inquiries however were by no means merely\r\ndictated by the desire to gratify a silly curiosity. A learned countryman,\r\nDr. Pfizmaier, one of the profoundest of Chinese scholars, had intrusted\r\nus with a list of fourteen rare Chinese books, the purchase of which\r\nseemed to us specially desirable, and we accordingly made every exertion,\r\nwith the assistance of our companion, himself well acquainted with\r\nChinese, to crown our search with success. With one exception we succeeded\r\nin purchasing the entire catalogue, and therewith gladly brought to an end\r\nour wearisome stay of upwards of an hour in the close steaming book-shop,\r\nexposed the while to a more than tropical temperature.\r\n\r\nChinese authors are, it must be allowed, terribly prolix in the treatment\r\nof their subjects, and instances are by no means uncommon in China of\r\nworks, especially those of an historical nature, extending to from forty\r\nto fifty volumes! Thus, for example, the \"Seventeen Historical classics\"\r\nconsists of 337 parts:--\"Mingschintschuen\" (History of the most renowned\r\nministers and statesmen), of thirty volumes:--\"Singpu\" (Lives of\r\nremarkable persons), of 122 parts:--the \"Encyclopedia of Matuanlin,\" with\r\nits additions, even reaches the immense number of six hundred\r\nvolumes!![126] Books are generally far from expensive in China; for a few\r\ndollars, comparatively, one may, owing to the cheapness of labour and of\r\ncost of production, purchase quite a large supply of ordinary literature.\r\n\r\nAdjoining this book-shop is a public bath establishment, where for 16\r\ncopper cash[127] (rather less than 1_d._ sterling), one may get a vapour\r\nbath, while six cash more are paid for keeping custody of the habiliments.\r\nThe bath is far from being elegant or comfortable, but when one reflects\r\non such extraordinary cheapness, it seems as though the very utmost had\r\nbeen attained. It consists of a large apartment, filled with steam, which\r\nis from time to time renewed, by dashing hot water upon stones, maintained\r\nat a high temperature, while ranged in readiness all round are a number of\r\ntubs of cold water for cooling the bather. In one of these establishments\r\nabout thirty persons may bathe at once, and as John Chinaman, despite his\r\nfilthy manners, is passably clean about the body, as testified by the\r\npains he is at with his head and hands, these places are as extensively\r\npatronized as they are greatly needed.\r\n\r\nOur next stoppage was at a pawnbroker's, an institution which, to all\r\nappearance, has been far longer in vogue in China than in Europe, and is\r\nmade great use of by the wealthy as well as the poorer classes. In the\r\nCelestial Kingdom, the same custom prevails as with us of pawning the\r\nwinter habiliments in summer, and summer apparel in winter; and this not\r\nso much for the sake of the money borrowed upon them, as to have them kept\r\nin safety and carefully preserved, especially in the case of costly furs.\r\nIn China the usual advance is of one half the value, upon a very low\r\ncomputation of the article pledged, for which the monthly charge is ten\r\ncash per 500, or twenty-four per cent. per annum. Whatever has not been\r\nredeemed at the end of three years, or of which the interest has not been\r\npaid, is put up to auction and knocked down to the highest bidder, the\r\nproceeds going to the benefit of the establishment. The utmost per-centage\r\nallowed by law is three per cent. a month; but it must not exceed two per\r\ncent. in winter, in order that the poor may be enabled to redeem the\r\narticles pledged. The broker gives a ticket for the articles pledged,\r\nwhich have a definite value, and may be sold in the street. Thieves find\r\nthese establishments very handy for disposing of their plunder, as they\r\ndeface or destroy the pawn-ticket so as to prevent the rightful owner from\r\nregaining possession of the stolen articles. When a pawnbroker sustains\r\nany loss through theft, or the outbreak of fire on his premises, he must\r\nmake good to his customers the value of the destroyed articles that had\r\nbeen left with him as pledges. If, however, the fire has broken out in the\r\nhouse of a neighbour, he is only bound to pay one half of the loss he may\r\nsustain. The establishment is managed by fifty individuals, whom the\r\nconcourse of people flocking in to pledge or redeem property keeps in\r\nconstant activity.\r\n\r\nConsidering the notorious and openly avowed indifference everywhere\r\nmanifested throughout China for the poor, the sick, and the unfortunate,\r\nthe number of charitable institutions to be found in all parts of China is\r\nvery surprising, all which, as has lately been proved, do not owe their\r\norigin to the introduction of Christianity, but had been in a flourishing\r\ncondition for a long time previously. Thus in several of the streets of\r\nShanghai, we came upon hospitals for children and foundlings ([Chinese\r\ncharacter(s)]), of the latter of which the one we visited was founded by\r\nvoluntary contribution so far back as 1710. This humane institution has a\r\nlanded property of about 30 acres, by the produce of which, as well as\r\nfrequent public collections, it is supported. In 1783, this orphan\r\nhospital was amalgamated with an asylum for old and decrepit persons, and\r\nothers incapacitated for labour, and one wealthy Chinese gentleman\r\nprovided 3000 taels[128] for this praiseworthy object, but somewhat later\r\nthis joint plan was abandoned, and the Orphan Asylum remains to this day\r\nself-supporting, while the poor, the sick, and the aged are relieved every\r\nmonth at the Custom-house out of funds specially set apart.\r\n\r\nAt the period of our visit we found thirty infants in the building, who\r\nhad been deposited by their mothers in a basket suspended in a recess at\r\nthe entrance. After the new-born child has been deposited, a signal is\r\ngiven with a bamboo-stick, after which the receptacle is turned inwards\r\nand the innocent without delay taken charge of. Each child has its own\r\nwet-nurse or attendant.\r\n\r\nThe building is lofty, roomy, and passably clean, but the children, one\r\nand all without exception, have a sickly appearance, and seem to suffer\r\nmuch from eruptions and affections of the eye. There was not one child\r\nabove two years of age. It is worth recording that every one of these\r\nchildren was of the female sex; their male offspring, even when\r\nillegitimate, the mothers seem much less disposed to part from. It\r\nfrequently happens, moreover, owing to the low considerations in which the\r\nfemale sex are held, that even legitimate children of that sex are\r\noccasionally committed to the silent receptacle of the foundling's basket.\r\n\r\nWe inquired of one of the overseers what was the destiny of these unhappy\r\nchildren when they grew up, but could get no satisfactory reply. We were\r\ninformed that they were occasionally adopted as children by those who had\r\nno family. But more extended inquiries leave us rather inclined to believe\r\nthat these poor waifs of humanity constitute a not inconsiderable\r\ncontingent to that unhappy class of beings who, carefully brought up,\r\nclothed, and fed by speculative foster-mothers, are at a suitable age sold\r\nfor concubines to the well-to-do Chinese.\r\n\r\nOne very remarkable charitable institution, for which there is no\r\nparallel in Europe, is the Tung-jin-tang ([Chinese character(s)]) or Hall\r\nof United Benevolence, founded by a number of philanthropists in 1804, for\r\nthe interment of the poor. This establishment, through its legacies,\r\ndonations, and voluntary contributions, speedily became so wealthy that it\r\nhas been enabled to take up, in addition to its original business, other\r\nobjects of a not less humane nature. It pensions poor widows of\r\nrespectable families with 700 cash (about L1 8_s._) per month; it presents\r\npersons above 60 years of age, if sickly and unable to work, with 600 cash\r\n(about L1 4_s._) a month, and provides, free of charge, wooden coffins, as\r\nalso digging implements, for those who are too poor to inter their dead\r\nrelatives. Another humane occupation of the society is the interment of\r\ncoffins containing dead bodies, which used to be exposed on the bare\r\nground in various parts of the city. Finally, it was the intention of the\r\nfounder of this charitable institution, so soon as the money should\r\npermit, to erect schools for the poor, to provide warm clothing in winter\r\nfor the helpless, as also to buy up animals destined for the\r\nslaughter-house, and set them at liberty again.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings connected with the direction of the institution are\r\ntransacted in public, and the managers for the time being are bound to\r\nfurnish for each year a detailed report[129] of the management. This\r\nhumane institution has since its foundation undergone many reforms, and\r\nat the period of our visit was confining its sphere of usefulness to three\r\nmain objects: 1st, The pensioning aged and broken-down persons of both\r\nsexes, with 600 cash a month. These however were not supplied with the\r\nmoney, but were for the most part taken into the house itself, or at least\r\nsupported through it. 2nd, The dispensing free of charge of various\r\nso-called universal medicines, for headache, stomach-complaints, fever,\r\ndiarrh[oe]a, spasms during the unhealthy season (June to October). On the\r\n3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd, and 28th of each month (that is, on every date\r\nending with a 3 or an 8), during the continuance of the sultry, damp,\r\nunhealthy season there was also provided for the sick and poor, gratis,\r\nadvice from Chinese physicians in the great hall. 3rd, The furnishing\r\ncoffins for the interment of those who died without means, or on payment\r\nin part by families not altogether penniless. In one of these extensive\r\nmagazines we saw a coffin bearing the number 1084, which was just coming\r\ninto requisition. During 36 months 1000 coffins and upwards had been\r\nsupplied to poor families for the interment of their dead! As we were\r\nleaving the building, we remarked in the principal apartment a large\r\nquantity of paper, partly written upon, partly in shreds, all heaped up.\r\nOn inquiry as to the object of this collection, we were informed that it\r\nwas for no industrial purpose, but solely to be ascribed to the profound\r\nrespect the Chinese have for every sort of writing. They regard written\r\nleaves as positively holy, and are particularly careful that no written\r\npaper shall chance to fall into improper hands, that might make a wrong\r\nuse of it. For this reason the society pays for every pound of old waste\r\npaper which the poor of Shanghai pick up in the street and bring to the\r\nInstitution three copper cash, and when the pile has attained a sufficient\r\nheight it is set on fire at a particular season.\r\n\r\nBuilt in close proximity to this \"Hall of United Benevolence\" is the\r\nsanctuary of the medical profession, or, as Mr. Muirhead translated for\r\nour benefit the gigantic Chinese inscription over the portal, \"the\r\nsacrificial hall of the medical faculty.\" This is a temple erected at the\r\nexpense of the nation to a celebrated Chinese physician, whose stature, in\r\nan easy, erect attitude, cut in wood the size of life and richly gilt, is\r\nerected upon a platform somewhat resembling an altar. Part of the drapery\r\nconsists of gigantic leaves, while his folded hands clasp a lotos-flower.\r\nIn front of the image is placed the inscription: \"The shrine of the spirit\r\nof the King of Medicine.\" Above the idol are the following words in\r\nChinese, cut in the stone and gilt, \"The divine husbandman and sacred\r\nruler!\" and thereafter, \"For all ages the instructive teacher.\"\r\n\r\nThis renowned physician had, it seems, instituted many experiments on\r\nhimself with new healing remedies, and according to popular belief had\r\nattained to an exact knowledge of all that was going on in the human\r\nframe, so that he could point out the seat of the malady by simply placing\r\na piece of common window-glass upon the pit of the patient's stomach, and\r\nlooking into it!\r\n\r\nAdjoining this College of Health is the city prison, or Tschi-hin, in\r\nwhich, when we saw it, were confined about 100 prisoners in the various\r\nwards. In that set apart for the worst class of criminals, we saw about\r\n40, heavily shackled and manacled. Three of these were confined in low\r\nwooden cages, about three feet in height and width, and four feet in\r\nlength, and fastened to each other by iron chains running through. These\r\nmen also wore iron rings on their feet. One of these unfortunates was\r\nsentenced to 70, and each of the other two to 60, days of such durance,\r\nwithout being suffered for one moment to come out from the cage, which was\r\nplaced on the ground, and like a hen-roost, was provided with perches\r\nrunning through it, so as to interfere still further with freedom of\r\nmovement. Their food consisted of rice and vegetables. According to their\r\nown showing, these three were sentenced to this terrible punishment in\r\nconsequence of some affray, but we had reason to believe that some more\r\nserious matter was the real cause of their having this penalty inflicted\r\non them. We gave the unhappy wretches a few pieces of silver. Each hastily\r\nsecured the donation in a corner of his cage, and seemed in his forlorn\r\ncondition doubly sensible of the value of a metal whose influence,\r\nespecially in China, is so powerful, so all-pervading, and so infallible.\r\n\r\nOne very peculiar institution is the Wei-kwan, a sort of Council Chamber,\r\nsituated on the N.E. side of the city between the walls and the river, in\r\nwhich all matters in dispute between mercantile men are adjusted, and in\r\nconjunction with which is a temple in honour of the goddess of the seas\r\n(Tien-Mu). In the centre of the council-room is a large elegantly-shaped\r\niron pan (Schang-Lu), in which the merchants and seamen frequenting the\r\nhall burn slips of paper, on which are written the wishes of those making\r\ntheir offerings. Also money, fruit, &c., are here sacrificed, and Chinese\r\nmariners, whose \"junks\" have come unscathed through a storm, or have been\r\npreserved, make their thank-offerings in the shape of elegant little\r\nmodels of their ships, which are placed in various parts of the building.\r\nThis hall was founded in 1270 by the Sung dynasty, on a site where certain\r\nChinese believed they had observed that the tumultuous tide of the Whampoa\r\nriver gradually lost its violence, as it approached the spot, a phenomenon\r\nwhich to them seemed of marvellous significance. Under the Yuen and Mui\r\ndynasties the temple was repeatedly plundered and burnt to the ground, but\r\nwas rebuilt through the influence of a Tao-priest. In 1735, an imperial\r\nedict ordered the observance of certain religious ceremonies from time to\r\ntime, an example which has been followed to the present day.\r\n\r\nDirectly facing the goddess of the sea (called also Kwan-Yin, Queen of\r\nHeaven),[130] who is represented by a life-size figure placed at the\r\nbottom of the apartment, a large stage is erected, on which Chinese dramas\r\nare represented for their entertainment from 10 o'clock in the morning\r\ntill nightfall.\r\n\r\nIn one part of the immense pile of buildings there are also provided\r\ndwellings for such Chinese merchants as visit Shanghai from the interior\r\nof the kingdom, and have neither friends nor relatives in the city with\r\nwhom they can take up their residence, for public taverns are in China\r\nonly frequented by the very lowest classes. We entered one of these\r\nChinese hotels, which we had come upon during our ramble, and inspected\r\nthe eating-rooms and bed-rooms, which are usually situated on the first\r\nfloor. The usual charge is from 100 to 140 cash a day for board (4_d._ to\r\n6_d._), and from 20 to 40 cash for lodging (1_d._ to 2_d._). The gloomy,\r\nfilthy, cavernous aspect of each room makes even a moment's stay\r\nintolerable. The victuals supplied consist chiefly of rice, vegetables,\r\nand fish. In the interior, board and lodging in these taverns is very much\r\ncheaper, and the well-known and highly meritorious English missionary Dr.\r\nMedhurst, who, in 1845, traversed, in the dress of a Chinese, a large\r\nportion of the silk and tea districts, relates that the customary charge\r\nfor supper, bed, and breakfast next morning altogether amounted to 80 cash\r\nonly, or about 3-3/8_d._![131] In the streets of Shanghai, the\r\neating-houses are greatly out-numbered by the tea-houses, where one gets a\r\ncup of tea for 6 cash (1/4_d._). These, like our own cafes, are laid out\r\nwith little tables, stools, and benches. As soon as a guest enters and\r\ntakes his seat, a Chinese attendant brings a cup, throws into it the\r\nproper quantity of tea-leaves, and pours boiling water upon it. After the\r\nlapse of a few minutes the hot light yellow liquid is hastily swallowed,\r\nbut avoiding the leaves which are swimming on the surface, and usually\r\nserve for a second or even a third infusion. These tea-houses are crowded\r\nwith visitors throughout the day, who sometimes transact business here\r\nover a cup of tea and a pipe of oiled tobacco, sometimes resort hither to\r\nwile the time listlessly away.\r\n\r\nThe chief place of amusement, however, of the native population of\r\nShanghai is the Tea-Garden (Tschin-Huang-Mian), or temple of the Emperor,\r\nwhich contains numerous gardens laid out in Chinese fashion, and booths of\r\nall sorts, besides the attractions of jugglers, singers, actors,\r\nsoothsayers, musicians, and mountebanks, all driving their respective\r\navocations. The whole scene is eminently characteristic of the\r\ngrotesqueness of Chinese taste. Artificial canals and tanks filled with\r\ngreen stagnant water, redolent of miasmatic effluvia, amid which the Lotos\r\nopens its lovely white blossoms, quantities of zig-zag bridges with\r\nbeautifully carved balustrades, islands with artificially constructed\r\nrocks and grottoes, subterranean passages, flags of all shapes and sizes,\r\nbearing the most bombastic inscriptions--such are the chief attractions of\r\na Chinese People's Garden, every large town boasting one such, erected at\r\nthe expense of the State, in which from early morning till late in the\r\nevening a vast crowd of human beings is incessantly surging to and fro,\r\nintent on pleasure, dissipation, or profit. The rabble, however, have not\r\naccess to every part of the Tea-Garden, a certain portion being set apart\r\nfor the recreation of the chief officials of the city (Tau-Tai). This\r\nportion, shut off by a lofty wall, is elegantly laid out, and is made\r\nattractive with all manner of dwarf trees nursed with great care and\r\nexpense, besides the usual grottoes, artificial hills and precipices,\r\npavilions, &c. Hither the head magistrate occasionally resorts to pass the\r\nwarmest hours of the day, and dozes away undisturbed by the cares of his\r\nonerous responsibilities. All the public gardens of China present almost\r\nthe identical features of the one we visited; a park without artificial\r\nislands and wooden bridges, without canals (in lieu of paths), without\r\npools of stagnant water thickly covered with the broad leaves of the\r\n_Nelumbium_, would, in the eyes of a Chinese, be deprived of its chief\r\npleasure and its greatest attraction.\r\n\r\nClose to the Tea-Garden is the largest Buddhist Temple within the city\r\nwalls, in which throughout the day the over-credulous Chinese kneel before\r\ntheir idols, and with many reverences murmur their set formulas of\r\nprayers. Like everything else in China, even religious observances are\r\nregarded from the most practical point of view. They think they have done\r\nenough when they have gone through a certain round of outward ceremonies.\r\nThe condition of most of the temples, the utter neglect of some, and the\r\nvarious employments of others, indicate that the Chinese either has no\r\nsense of the sanctity attaching to such places of devotion, or else\r\nattaches but little value to the act itself. The men rarely enter the\r\ntemples. It is only the women who, to satisfy the cravings of the heart,\r\nhave recourse to invoking the Deity. Frequently one sees a worshipper\r\napproach the attendant sitting in the porch of the temple, in order to get\r\ntheir horoscope calculated by him for a few cash. For this purpose she\r\nshakes with eager devotion a box of bamboo-cane filled with thin wands,\r\nuntil one of these wands springs out. The words inscribed on each wand\r\nfurnish the oracle-expounder with an infallible sign, by which, after\r\nconsulting one of the books of Chinese wisdom spread out before him, he is\r\nenabled to pronounce the answer of the divinity to the prayers preferred\r\nby the poor dupe. The most prolific source of revenue of the temple and\r\nits ministrants, consists, however, in the sale of the gold and silver\r\ntissue paper,[132] which plays so important a part in the worship of the\r\nChinese, and owing to their zealous and frequent use are heaped up in\r\nimmense piles, for consumption by fire in a gigantic furnace.\r\n\r\nMuch more edifying than the interior of the great Buddhist temple with its\r\ntroops of swag-bellied idols in their parti-coloured apparel, some with a\r\ngood-humoured leer, others sulkily scowling on the beholder, is the\r\nappearance of the temple of Confucius[133] in a remote quarter of the\r\ncity. In this extensive building, at once elegant and simple, and with\r\nnumerous halls and corridors, the scholars undergo their examination for\r\nthe service of the state; here the Government officials at stated seasons\r\nperform certain religious ceremonies, and here all the _literati_ assemble\r\nfor the discussion of grave questions of debate. The main hall has its\r\nred-tinted walls covered with Chinese and Tartar inscriptions, all of\r\nwhich refer to Confucius, his doctrines and his wisdom. At intervals, a\r\nnumber of tablets let into the wall inform the visitor that this edifice\r\nis devoted to the instruction of the virtuous, and the cultivation of the\r\nendowments. At the same time every person who passes this in a sedan-chair\r\nor on horseback, whether an official or one of the people, is compelled\r\nto quit his vehicle and traverse the consecrated space on foot. Over the\r\nentrance to the right is written: \"His virtue is comparable to Heaven and\r\nEarth;\" and above the door to the left we read, \"His teachings comprise\r\nall the wisdom of ancient and modern days.\" Behind the temple is a smaller\r\nedifice, dedicated to the five progenitors of Confucius. The temple itself\r\nis similarly surrounded with various apartments, all, as their bombastic\r\ninscriptions announce, devoted to the honour and advancement of knowledge.\r\nOne of these chambers is dedicated to the god of Literature, another to\r\nthe guardian spirit of Science. The latter is curiously represented as a\r\nfigure holding in one hand a _stylus_, in the other a lump of silver,\r\nemblematic, we presume, of \"man through wisdom attaining unto riches.\"\r\n\r\nIn every city throughout China there is, as well as a tea-garden, a temple\r\nin honour of the great teacher Kong-fu-tse, whose knowledge and whose\r\nmoral system, 2400 years after his mortal pilgrimage, instruct and gladden\r\nnot merely his own countrymen, but all admirers throughout the world of\r\nwhat is noble and virtuous.\r\n\r\nAmong the various monasteries of the city, we visited one of the Taouists,\r\ncalled the Du-Kung or Great Mirror (probably of Virtue), where strangers\r\nprovided with introductions are received and entertained at 150 cash\r\n(6_d._ per diem). This cloister, whose sole inhabitants are some five or\r\nsix Chinese monks, is situated close to the wall, and forms one of the\r\nbest points whence to obtain a view of the entire city.\r\n\r\nThe Taouists, who follow the Tao, the \"way of knowledge,\" and arrogate to\r\nthemselves a more profound insight into the mysterious powers of nature,\r\nas well as more special acquaintance with and definite powers over good\r\nand evil spirits, are disciples of the doctrines of Lao-tse,[134] and are\r\nextensively scattered throughout the country, although at present, in\r\nconsequence of their losing themselves deeper and deeper in a slothful,\r\nsensual mode of existence, their proselytism is proceeding at a much\r\nslower ratio than formerly. It is purely accidental that there is\r\nimmediately adjoining the Taoui monastery a convent known as that of the\r\n\"White nuns,\" a small one-storey building, kept however singularly neat\r\nand clean. Here we saw six Buddhist nuns, with close-shaven heads and in\r\nlong white dresses, which gave them quite a masculine aspect. They\r\nreceived us with much courtesy, and escorted us round the various\r\napartments with considerable _empressement_. They were mostly widows, who\r\npass their lives here in calm retrospective contemplation, and occupy\r\nthemselves with preparing little articles for the Buddhist ritual, such as\r\ncensers, tapers, printed sacrificial papers, &c., with which apparently\r\nthey contrive to support themselves. These associations (Ni-koo) were\r\nusually founded by legacies and donations by pious Chinese, and are\r\nexceedingly useful as providing an asylum for poor, helpless women, weary\r\nof life. Many widows withdraw into these abodes of peace, there to pass\r\nthe rest of their lives, free from the tumult of the world, in the\r\nexercise of devotion and of works of neighbourly love and charity.\r\nNevertheless, if we are to believe common report, works of piety are not\r\nthe only objects occasionally pursued in these Buddhist convents, and the\r\nweb of intrigue and amorous adventure, of which they have frequently been\r\nthe scene, has not a little tended to lower the estimate in which these\r\nreligious societies are held, and even threatens to cut short their\r\nexistence. A people of such a materialistic mode of life, and such\r\nant-like industry, as the Chinese, who rarely know what it is to have one\r\nholiday in the entire year, must involuntarily look with argus-like eye on\r\nall religious communities, which pass their time in luxurious ease and\r\nexemption from care, without in any way advancing the well-being of their\r\nfellow-creatures by either mental or physical labour.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our peregrinations through the streets of Shanghai we\r\nalso came upon the shop of a Chinese apothecary (Yak-Tien), which\r\nexternally bears a considerable resemblance to a similar establishment in\r\nEurope, but widely differs in respect of details. The Chinese Materia\r\nMedica is especially abundant in patent medicines, the use and application\r\nof which, it must be allowed, is frequently of the most extraordinary\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest researches of Dr. Hobson, of whose important\r\nservices in the diffusion of European medical science in China we shall\r\nhave much to say in a future page, we are acquainted with 442 drugs from\r\namong the three great kingdoms of Nature, which must be kept in every\r\nwell-stocked Chinese drug-store, of which 314 belong to the botanical, 78\r\nto the animal, and 50 to the mineral world. We shall, however, in this\r\nplace only indicate those of which Chinese physicians avail themselves\r\nmost frequently in the preparation of their medicines, such, for example,\r\nas birds' nests, dried red-spotted lizard, the fresh tips of stags'\r\nantlers, the shell of the tortoise, dogs' flesh, bones of animals,\r\npreparations from various parts of the human body, whale-bone,\r\noyster-shells, skins of snakes, shark's maw and fin, tendons of deer and\r\nbuffalo, dried silk-worms, their larvae and excrement, bamboo shavings, the\r\nbear's gall, preparations from human _faeces_, scraped rhinoceros and\r\nantelope horn, rabbit dung, cuttle-fish bone, dried varnish, dried leeches\r\nand earthworms, red marble, refuse of ivory, preparations from toads,\r\npetrifactions, old copper money,[135] snow-water,[136] human milk,[137]\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\nThese pharmaceutics are brought from various parts of China, as well as\r\nfrom Japan, Siam, and the Straits of Malacca, and constitute an important\r\nand profitable branch of commerce. Many of them are sold at the druggist's\r\nin the raw state, when they are used as sympathetic remedies, amulets, or\r\ngenerally for external use. The Chinese druggists sell their medicaments\r\nfor the most part in the form of powders or pills. These latter are\r\nusually made up in a capsule of bees-wax for greater facility of\r\nadministration, so that the dose as it comes from the shop resembles\r\nthose small wax-cakes used by house-wives for waxing their thread. One\r\nsuch cake contains four or six pills, called _Tzi-pau-tan_, or very costly\r\npills, which are used as a sort of universal specific against fevers,\r\naffections of the digestive organs, headaches, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable and costly article in the Chinese pharmacop[oe]ia is,\r\nhowever, the Ginseng (_Panax Ginseng_, or _Panax Quinquefolia_), which is\r\nchiefly found in Mantchooria and the deserts to the north of the peninsula\r\nof Corea. The circumstance that the Ginseng is still a monopoly of the\r\nChinese Government, only a few privileged individuals being annually\r\npermitted to purchase a certain quantity for its weight in pure gold, has\r\nmuch more to do with its efficacy as a panacea than the benefits conferred\r\nby its curative powers. The roots are about the size and thickness of a\r\nman's little finger, and break short off when bent. When cleaned they are\r\ntransparent, and of a dark amber colour.\r\n\r\nOf the Ginseng there are three qualities sold in the Chinese drug-stores.\r\nOne leang or ounce of the best (the largest and finest) costs 50 dollars,\r\nof the medium quality five dollars, and of the most inferior quality one\r\ndollar. The Ginseng root is also found in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and\r\nCanada, and is thence exported to China, but the Chinese prefer that of\r\ntheir native forests, even though these are very much dearer, and there is\r\nhardly any difference to remark between them. As the plant is only found\r\nin the wild state, and obstinately resists all attempts to cultivate it,\r\nits collection among the forests of North America is attended with great\r\nhardship and expense, and whereas in former years the profit realized on\r\nthis article of commerce by English and American merchantmen amounted to\r\nfrom 500 to 600 per cent., it is now reduced to a very moderate\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nA more general subject of interest is presented by the shops where is sold\r\nthe porcelain-ware, the manufacture of which dates from a very remote\r\nperiod of Chinese history, and was already a flourishing trade at the\r\ncommencement of our historic epoch. Indeed we may reasonably assume,\r\nnotwithstanding the beautiful specimens of the art which from time to time\r\nare brought to light, that this special branch of industry is at present\r\nin a state of decline, while of many kinds of porcelain manufacture no\r\nexamples can now be shown, as the secret of their manipulation has\r\nperished. What usually interests Europeans in these shops is what is known\r\nas \"crackle\" porcelain,[138] the upper surface of which everywhere\r\npresents broken lines, so that the entire vessel appears as though it\r\nconsisted of numbers of small pieces cemented to each other, the whole\r\nhaving very much the appearance of Mosaic. But this description also is no\r\nlonger manufactured of the first quality in the present day. Antique\r\nporcelain is of extraordinary value, but specimens of modern manufacture,\r\nsuch as small figures, mannikins, &c., are very cheap, and are much the\r\nsame as those imported to Europe.\r\n\r\nOne marked partiality of the Chinese is their fondness for suspending\r\ngrasshoppers in small elegant baskets of bamboo strips, or twisted wire,\r\nin which, whatever the season or the weather, these little captives keep\r\nup a constant pleasant chirping. This custom is of great antiquity, and\r\nwhile one even now finds among the populace of the present day some of\r\nthese chirpers thus carefully tended, there once was a time when the\r\ngrasshopper was the object of universal adoration, and enjoyed all the\r\nhonours of Fashion. They were indebted for this singular good fortune,\r\naccording to the abbe Grosier,[139] to a poor scholar under the Thang\r\ndynasty, in the 7th century of our era, who to relieve his poverty fell\r\nupon the singular expedient of trading in these insects. He went into the\r\ncountry, selected the most beautiful insects he could find, constructed\r\nelegant little cages for them, and returning to the city offered them for\r\nsale in the most frequented streets of Tschang-gan. The idea was novel,\r\nand the wealthy upper classes speedily found a charm in having the music\r\nof the fields thus transplanted into their houses. The Empress, the\r\nQueens, the ladies of the Palace, in a word, every one was eager to\r\npossess these songsters of the meadow. There was actually an enactment\r\npassed for the supply of the Imperial Palace with the requisite number of\r\nthese insects. The fashion rose to a perfect mania--the little Zirperu was\r\nencountered at every corner--it was taken out whenever a call was\r\npaid--the whole city resounded with its shrill cry. The fine arts, and\r\nevery branch of industry, felt its impulse. There was no textile fabric,\r\nno embroidery, no design, no vessel, on which it did not conspicuously\r\nfigure. It was represented in metal and in jewellery, and no handsome lady\r\nthought her toilette complete, unless she sported a grasshopper among her\r\nhair. This mania has died out in China, but the buzz of the insect still\r\ncontinues to furnish matter of amusement for the populace and children of\r\nall classes, and they are still caught in large quantities, and exposed\r\nfor sale in the streets. Singular to say, all ancient and modern writers,\r\nif we are to judge by their delineations, describe these insects as\r\n_cicadae_, whereas it was shown and proved by the researches of one of the\r\nzoologists of the Expedition, that the insect is no _cicada_, but a\r\nspecies of grasshopper (_Decticus_), which, so far as appears, has never\r\nhitherto been described. Very probably the circumstance that the noise\r\nmade by each of these insects is very similar, gave circulation to this\r\nerror of upwards of a thousand years' standing, whence people would\r\nwithout further examination take it for granted that the insect confined\r\nin the cage belonged to that species whose place in natural history, and\r\nwhose special musical qualifications, mankind had so long been familiar\r\nwith. One of these grasshoppers was kept for months in such a cage on\r\nboard our ship, and chirped away lustily, fair weather or foul, even when\r\nconfined in a close cupboard. On the other hand, some _cicadae_, with\r\nwhich similar experiments were made, lived only two or three days in\r\ncaptivity. None sang, unless when teased, or when a number more were\r\nintroduced into the vessel, thereby incommoding them, and none took\r\nnourishment. It was obvious that the _cicadae_ possessed none of those\r\ncharacteristics which would enable them to be kept in captivity as pets,\r\nwhereas, on the other hand, the grasshoppers and crickets were especially\r\nadapted for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWe were anxious to visit a variety of other interesting places, ere\r\nquitting the sultry, gloomy Chinese city on our return to the more genial\r\nEuropean quarter. But evening was already setting in, and after sunset the\r\ngates of the city are closed, and neither Chinese nor European can after\r\nthat hour obtain access to the city. Whoever is belated must find shelter\r\nfor the night in the house of some hospitable friend, until with the first\r\nbreak of morning the gates are re-opened, communication is restored with\r\nthe foreign quarter, and the previous day's scene of bustle is renewed.\r\n\r\nThe next object which excited our interest was a Chinese school. Ascending\r\na wooden staircase, we enter a room, quite empty but for a table and\r\nstools, in which a haggard woe-begone Chinese, with long tail and rod in\r\nhand, is walking to and fro, while at a table some dozen of boys of from\r\neight to twelve are engaged in reading. Their loud accents may be heard\r\ndown in the street outside. The cost of the schools for the people is\r\nchiefly defrayed by voluntary subscriptions, foundations, &c. &c. The\r\nchildren of the middle classes pay for nine months' instruction, three\r\nSpanish dollars. Many teachers have more than a hundred scholars, and thus\r\nearn about 1000 dollars per annum. These, it is true, are exceptions, but\r\nteaching as a profession seems on the whole to be fully better remunerated\r\nin China than in European countries. There it is in much higher\r\nestimation, and receives better recompense. The wealthy Chinese usually\r\nengage private tutors for their children, who, as among ourselves, usually\r\nform part of the family. Elementary education is almost universal\r\nthroughout China. There are but few Chinese who are not at least able to\r\nread and write. One very gratifying instance of the prevailing religious\r\ntoleration, well worthy of example in the Christian states of Europe, is\r\nthe presence of Protestant and Catholic places of worship in the midst of\r\nBuddhist temples, and other edifices dedicated to heathen worship. The\r\nAmerican Episcopal church, erected in 1850, at the expense of a wealthy\r\nmerchant and ship-owner of Boston named Appleton, at a cost of 6000\r\ndollars, already numbers eighty converts. It is an extremely simple yet\r\nneat-looking place of worship, quite in the style of the chapels in the\r\nWestern portion of the American Union, and has in connection with it a\r\nschool numbering about forty native scholars. Every Sunday morning at ten,\r\na sermon is preached, which is attended by most of the foreign community.\r\nFar grander and more imposing in plan and fittings is the Catholic\r\ncathedral of Tong-Kadu, confessedly the finest place of Christian worship\r\nthroughout China. The construction of this building was commenced by\r\nvoluntary subscription in 1846, and completed in 1852, the total cost\r\namounting to 230,000 _leangs_, or about L65,000. Within there is a large\r\norgan, constructed by one of the lay brothers of bamboo pipes, whose\r\nsaddening yet inspiring notes, heard in the festivals of the Church,\r\ninvite the Christian community far and wide to devotion and instruction.\r\nAt present this cathedral is under the charge of a bishop of the Order of\r\nthe Jesuits.\r\n\r\nOur road from the Chinese city to the European quarter led us past an\r\nestablishment which bore interesting testimony to the industrial activity\r\nof the Chinese. It is an oil factory worked exclusively by natives, and\r\ngiving employment to about 400 workmen, besides 80 draught oxen. The oil\r\nis extracted from indigenous beans, and is so copious, that 1400 _catties_\r\n(1750 lbs.) of oil are procured daily, which is worth 74 _cash_ per\r\n_catty_ (about 3-3/4_d._ per lb.), and is used both for cooking and for\r\nlight. The residuary oil-cake, after expression of the oily matter, is\r\nused as manure.[140] A workman may earn at this description of labour from\r\n100 to 200 _cash_ a day (4_d._ to 8_d._).\r\n\r\nAs we left the manufactory, and were bending our stops towards the little\r\nEastern gate, our gaze was suddenly attracted by a spacious and elegant\r\nmansion, evidently the property of a well-to-do Chinese. This, as we were\r\ninformed by our companion, proved to be the residence of the Wuong family,\r\nwhich ranks among the five oldest and most distinguished families in\r\nShanghai. There is to be seen in the neighbourhood a small stone memorial\r\nshaped like a mausoleum, which, with the Emperor's permission, was erected\r\nby the inhabitants of the district in which she lived, to commemorate the\r\nbenevolence and philanthropic exertions of the mother of Wuong. The custom\r\nof honouring ladies distinguished by their virtues and benevolence, by the\r\nerection of temples, cenotaphs, &c., is by no means unusual in China, and\r\nis in marvellous contrast to the almost slavish treatment which the female\r\nsex usually meets with. Nevertheless, in the city and environs of Shanghai\r\nalone there are ninety such triumphal arches and memorials to as many\r\nexemplary and philanthropic ladies. The majority of these were married,\r\nand some had attained a very great age, one having died at 104 years, and\r\nanother at 115 years of age![141]\r\n\r\nIn the house of Wuong, who stands in high repute among the Europeans as a\r\nmerchant and ship-owner, we were received with the most gratifying\r\nhospitality. As soon as we entered the house, an attendant immediately\r\npresented tea in small cups, which, in conformity with the usages of the\r\ncountry, had to be swallowed in all its native bitterness without\r\nadmixture of sugar or milk. Immediately after an old nurse made her\r\nappearance, and struck up with our excellent conductor, Mr. Syles, who\r\nseemed to be everywhere welcomed by the Chinese, and was well acquainted\r\nwith the family, a long conversation upon the most diverse subjects. At\r\nlength the master of the house himself made his appearance, a dignified,\r\nstately man, arrayed in a light elegant grey silk frock, but in deportment\r\nand externals not differing in the very least from his Chinese attendants,\r\nand himself conducted us round the house. He seemed to feel pleasure in\r\nthe opportunity of baring to the view of a stranger the very penetralia\r\nof his beautiful abode. We wandered through numerous apartments simply\r\nyet elegantly furnished, with various antechambers and corridors, among\r\nwhich were interspersed little plots laid out with dwarf plantations,\r\nartistically-designed grottoes, and \"rookeries.\" In one of the rooms was a\r\n\"punkah,\" an article of furniture rarely met with in a Chinese household.\r\nOn reaching the library or study, our host bade us be seated, while he\r\nagain ordered tea to be served. This small but pretty apartment was\r\ncovered all round with inscriptions in Chinese (chiefly maxims from\r\nConfucius), which, written on rolls of white paper, were suspended on the\r\nwalls. While sipping our tea, and engrossed in conversation, an attendant\r\nappeared with somewhat thick cloths, steeped in hot water, with which to\r\nwipe our faces and hands. The evaporation of the moisture lowers the\r\ntemperature of the skin, and has so refreshing an effect, that one cannot\r\nbut feel surprised that this custom is not more extensively patronized in\r\nhot countries, or put in practice by ourselves during our hot sultry\r\nsummers.\r\n\r\nWith respect to ourselves, what appeared most to interest our Chinese host\r\nin his silken attire was our apparel. He felt over and over again the\r\nblack alpaca coat, which was worn by one of the members of our Expedition,\r\nand remarked, \"these Western races are truly marvellous people; they wear\r\nfar more clothes than we do, yet they perspire less.\" And thereupon Wuong\r\nmopped his face twice with the towel, which in the mean time the attendant\r\nhad again dipped in the hot water, and thoroughly wrung out. As we were\r\ntaking our departure, our courteous host accompanied us to the threshold.\r\n\r\nIn the portico were a number of wooden tables lacquered with red varnish,\r\non which were inscribed in large golden letters of the Chinese character\r\nthe titles of honour of the family of Wuong, which on festive occasions\r\nwere drawn in front of the head of the family as he sat on his sofa.\r\n\r\nAfter this ramble through the Chinese town, we returned to the \"Strangers'\r\nQuarter,\" where we came upon a widely different mode of life. Here\r\neverything is arranged upon the European model, and the attention is only\r\ndiverted by those minor accessories, in which the climatic conditions have\r\nnecessitated some variation. The houses are universally lofty, roomy, and\r\nagreeable, usually surrounded by a garden, and many of them present an\r\nalmost palace-like aspect. More even than to the merchants in Broadway is\r\nthe designation of \"merchant princes\" applicable to the foreign merchants\r\nof China and the East Indies, for it is among them beyond any other class\r\non the globe, that there prevails a luxury almost princely in its\r\nmagnificence. In such a place as Shanghai, which can present to the\r\neducated foreigner such a meagre equivalent for his numerous intellectual\r\nprivations, each man endeavours in the readiest possible way to render his\r\nmaterial existence as comfortable and agreeable as he possibly can. This\r\nleading principle one sees illustrated and carried out in practice in the\r\nsplendid designs of their residences, and the exquisite refinement and\r\ncomfort of their internal arrangements, as well as in the scrupulous\r\nattention paid to the cellar and the \"cuisine.\"\r\n\r\nOn the ground-floors are the counting-house and stores, on the first floor\r\nthe drawing-room, the dining-room, and the sleeping-apartments. All these\r\nvarious chambers are decorated with as much attention to comfort as good\r\ntaste, and almost every single article bears on it the solid,\r\nunmistakeable impress of its English origin. Even into the most minute\r\ndetails all the genuine comfort of an English drawing-room is introduced,\r\nincreased even, if that be possible, by the adoption of a few customs\r\npeculiar to the peoples of Asia, such as mats of fragrant materials placed\r\nbefore the doors and windows, Punkahs, which, kept in motion by Chinese\r\nservants, keep up a constant current of fresh air, while through the\r\nverandah, or the open glass casement, where the family sit swinging to and\r\nfro in an American rocking-chair, a delicious cool breeze blows in the\r\nmornings and evenings. A well-appointed numerous household is constantly\r\nhovering around, eagerly intent to anticipate the slightest wish of their\r\nemployers. Probably in no part of the world are there more intelligent or\r\npunctual servants than the Chinese. They get through the utmost variety of\r\nwork with consummate tact, method, and facility. Everything is done\r\nrapidly and noiselessly, and one is served with the utmost regularity,\r\nwithout being pestered with too much attention.\r\n\r\nThe members of the _Novara_ Expedition experienced in Shanghai the most\r\nhearty hospitality. Even the presence of the various embassies, and the\r\nmomentous nature of the operations of which the Gulf of Petcheli was the\r\nscene, proved no barrier to a most flattering reception being accorded to\r\nthis the first maritime Expedition of a German power. Foreigners of the\r\nmost widely divergent races and standing,--consuls, missionaries,\r\nmerchants, naturalists, journalists,--each in his own way vied with the\r\nrest in ministering to our comfort, and in aiding us in the prosecution of\r\nour objects.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished of the physicians and missionaries of the\r\nLondon Missionary Society, Dr. B. Hobson, who since 1838 has resided at\r\nCanton in the honourable capacity of a \"medical missionary,\"[142] and who,\r\na few months before our arrival, had, in consequence of the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, removed to Shanghai, was so kind as to furnish us, out of his\r\nown rich treasures of Chinese lore, with much valuable information, and\r\nacquainted us with the various objects aimed at by the praiseworthy\r\nactivity of the London Board of Missions. This body by no means confines\r\nits operations to the diffusion of tracts and works relating to\r\nChristianity published in the Chinese language, but combines\r\nsimultaneously with that sphere of action the excellent idea of\r\nministering to the physical necessities of the poor and sick Chinese, and\r\nof helping them in their need. While able, eloquent Dr. Muirhead presides\r\nover the missionary schools, and the not less zealous Mr. Wylie\r\nsuperintends the printing of the books, our highly-educated friend Dr.\r\nHobson takes charge of the hospital, the cost of which is defrayed partly\r\nby the Missionary Society, partly by the European community.\r\n\r\nThe building itself is rather small and unpretending, and can at most\r\naccommodate only thirty patients. But it was erected chiefly for those\r\ncases which in England it is customary to classify in the general category\r\nof \"accidents,\" injuries, that is, sustained unexpectedly, or in a riot,\r\n&c. &c. Every day between twelve and one o'clock a consultation is held,\r\nand treatment provided gratuitously. Hither flock hundreds of invalids, to\r\navail themselves of this benevolent arrangement, and while Dr. Hobson is\r\nbusy giving orders and dispensing drugs in his small apartment, a native\r\nconvert in the waiting-room is preaching the Living Word to those who come\r\nfor advice.\r\n\r\nWe passed an entire hour in the dispensary, not merely for the purpose of\r\nwitnessing the various descriptions of cases, mostly of a surgical nature,\r\nbut also to catch many an instructive remark from the lips of Dr. Hobson.\r\nThus he remarked, as the result of a medical practice of more than sixteen\r\nyears, that the Chinese are uncommonly soon affected by the use of mercury\r\nand quinine. A very small dose of either of these drugs very speedily\r\nshows a marked effect. Oddly enough, quinine, as a tonic and febrifuge, is\r\nunknown in the Chinese pharmacop[oe]ia, and is almost exclusively\r\nprescribed for the cure of the opium-smoking form of mania.\r\n\r\nIn China, a physician is treated with great distinction, and is usually\r\ndesignated as szi-yay (the honourable teacher). Of late years cholera\r\n(tschan-kan-tschui, literally \"the contracting of the tendons\") and\r\nsmall-pox had committed fearful ravages among the populace, and the\r\nappalling havoc committed by the latter-named disease gave occasion for\r\nthe publication by the English missionaries of a short treatise translated\r\ninto Chinese, on the importance of vaccination. Among children especially\r\nthe mortality caused by this fell scourge was very great, and the\r\ninstances of _leucoma_ and loss of sight resulting from the disease appear\r\nto have been very numerous.\r\n\r\nDr. Hobson, who in 1851 had published a volume of Physiology in the Canton\r\ndialect, has also completed a handbook of Practical Surgery, with 400\r\nwoodcuts, and, like the preceding, had had it printed by native workmen.\r\nEven the drawings were drawn on the wood and cut by native artists after\r\nEnglish originals. Many of the scientific phrases contained in these works\r\nmust have required to be entirely reconstructed, or else expressed by a\r\ncircumlocution. Dr. Hobson intended to follow up these two splendid\r\nundertakings with a fresh work upon Pharmacology, as also a treatise upon\r\nthe diseases of women and children, both, like their predecessors, to be\r\nin the Canton dialect, as that most universally used.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, however, possess themselves a pretty comprehensive medical\r\nliterature, whence we may infer that from the earliest times they paid\r\nspecial attention to the science of medicine. According to a Chinese\r\ntradition, the Emperor Schi-nung, 3200 years before our era, collected a\r\n\"Materia Medica,\" and 570 years later, the Emperor Hwang-te is said to\r\nhave written a work with the title \"Sonwan\" (open questions in medicine).\r\nThe celebrated work, \"the Doctrine of the Pulse,\" by Wang-shu-fo, was\r\nwritten in the reign of Tsche-Hwang-te (the book-burner), about 510 B.C. A\r\nsecond edition of this work was published in the reign of Kang-he, in the\r\nyear 1693 of our era. About A.D. 229 the Chinese physician Tschang-kae-pin\r\nwrote the first Chinese work which, in addition to the theory of medicine,\r\nalso contained prescriptions. The great \"_Materia Medica_\" of China was\r\ncompiled by Li-tschi-kan, and was published by his son during the reign of\r\nWan-Leih, about A.D. 1600. The most important medical work in Chinese is\r\nthe E-tsang-kin-ksen, or \"the Golden Mirror of Medical Authors,\" collated\r\nby Imperial authority from the best works of earlier native authors,\r\nespecially from the \"Nan-king,\" and the writings of Dr. Tschang-kae-pin.\r\nThis was published in 1743 (the seventh year of the reign of Keen-lung),\r\nand consists of thirty-two volumes 8vo, with upwards of 400 woodcuts.[143]\r\n\r\nThe information furnished us by Dr. Hobson with reference to the terrible\r\nforms of leprosy in China are of so much interest, general as well as\r\nspecial, that we believe we shall not transcend the scope of this work, if\r\nwe give in these pages the valuable data upon the subject in all their\r\ncompleteness.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese consider leprosy as the most appalling of diseases, since,\r\nwhile resisting all means of cure itself, it attacks others, and they\r\naccordingly avoid in the greatest terror all those who are smitten with\r\nit. Like the people whom Moses brought out, the Chinese regard leprosy as\r\na direct consequence of impiety, an expiation for sin committed. For this\r\nreason those afflicted with leprosy are rarely regarded with pity. No hand\r\nof sympathy is stretched forth to give aid, no heart feels itself impelled\r\nto alleviate their hopeless condition, and thus the most wretched of all\r\nare in the eyes of the masses simply objects of disgust and of horror.\r\nLeprosy is called Lae in Chinese. In the Imperial dictionary of Kang-he\r\nLae, is described as a very evil kind of disease, which breaks out upon\r\nthe skin in the form of blotches and pustules. Gutzlaff and others\r\nacquainted with Chinese make use however of the words Ma-fung to express\r\nleprosy, which is also used by native writers to indicate the disease.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese physicians consider leprosy as a subtle, penetrating,\r\npoisonous effluvium which has infected the blood. They profess to\r\nrecognize 36 different kinds of leprosy, among which they enumerate every\r\nform and variety of Lichen, Scabies, Psoriasis, and Syphilis. Common as\r\nthe disease is in Southern China, it is unknown in the North; its area of\r\nmanifestation seems to be confined within the tropics. It is, however,\r\nrelated of many Chinese in good circumstances, that when attacked by\r\nleprosy they have removed to Pekin, where after a two years' residence\r\nthey have lost all trace of the infection, which, however, broke out anew\r\nimmediately on their return to the South.\r\n\r\nLeprosy does not seem by its physical effects to shorten life. There are\r\nin China numbers of aged people attacked with this disease, and in the\r\nLazar-house at Canton there is still living an old leper upwards of\r\neighty, who has long found an asylum in that hospital as an incurable.\r\nSuicide is not uncommon among those thus sorely smitten, when they usually\r\npoison themselves with an over-dose of opium, hang themselves, or drown\r\nthemselves, for death, they say, makes them once more clean. Although the\r\nChinese believe in the hereditary transmission of leprosy, they\r\nnevertheless think that the disease becomes of a milder type in the third\r\ngeneration, and entirely disappears in the fourth. Marriages never take\r\nplace with the offspring of leprous parents or grand-parents, but on the\r\nother hand the lepers and their children intermarry among themselves. A\r\nleper however of the fourth generation would only ally himself with a girl\r\nof the same degree of exemption. The children of such a union would be\r\nconsidered sound and free from leprosy, and would no longer be excluded in\r\nany way from social rights.\r\n\r\nBut the Chinese believe leprosy not alone hereditary, but also infectious\r\nthrough the very slightest contact. Hence the father abandons his own\r\nchild; the children flee from their parents: they will not eat and drink\r\nwith them, will not sit in their company, will not use the chairs which\r\nhave been sat upon by the leper, until at least the surrounding atmosphere\r\nhas been fumigated with a torch. Even the law declares leprosy to be a\r\ncontagious disease. A wealthy leper durst not venture to leave his own\r\nroom, where he is excluded from all communication with the outer world,\r\nwithout exposing himself to the danger of being arrested by the police,\r\nand mulcted in a heavy fine, or else sent to what is called the Leper\r\nvillage near Canton, an abode of human woe and misery, which even the\r\nleprous regard with horror.[144]\r\n\r\nAs the Chinese physicians regard leprosy as a taint of the blood, and in\r\ntheir treatment adopt Hahnemann's principle of _similia similibus\r\ncurantur_, they prescribe by way of remedies the most repulsive and\r\ndisgusting substances which they can select from their _Materia Medica_,\r\nsuch as the saliva of the toad, beetles, snakes, worms, scorpions,\r\ncentipedes, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nDr. Hobson considers leprosy, when once fully developed, to be incurable.\r\nSuch remedies as arsenic, salts, acids, in short alteratives, occasionally\r\nprove efficacious at an early stage of the malady, as also Iodine baths,\r\nand mercurial friction. External remedies however are usually found to be\r\nunavailing in reaching the root of the disorder, its seat lying deeper\r\nthan an ordinary affection of the skin.\r\n\r\nOf late years the seeds of the Tschaul or Tscharul Mugra (one of the order\r\nof _Flacourtiaceae_), have been administered for leprosy by several English\r\nphysicians in India, and certainly, in some instances, with such results\r\nthat the most sanguine hopes were entertained of its efficacy in all cases\r\nof leprosy. Dr. Hobson informed us that Dr. Mouatt, of the Medical\r\nCollege, Calcutta, who was the first to discover the remarkable properties\r\nof this plant, sent him, when he was at Canton, a considerable quantity of\r\nthese seeds for the purpose of experimenting with them.[145] They were\r\nground into a coarse powder, and in that state administered twice a day\r\nat considerable intervals in doses of about 60 grains, the external sores\r\nbeing at the same time rubbed with the oil pressed out of the seeds. The\r\ncure must be persevered in without interruption for six months, and must\r\nbe from time to time aided by saline purgatives. The first symptom of\r\nimprovement shows itself in an abatement of the prominence and redness of\r\nthe eruption, and the appearance of white scales all round it. This remedy\r\nhas long been known to the Chinese, but those who are acquainted with the\r\nactive curative principle contained in the seeds of the Tscharul Mugra,\r\nkeep the secret to themselves in their own interest.[146] Dr. Hobson\r\nassured us that he had cured two cases of leprosy taken early, and in a\r\nvery mild form, by the administration of these seeds, and had seen several\r\ngreatly improved by their use; but this experienced physician is, like\r\nothers, distrustful of the efficacy of the seeds of Tscharul Mugra in\r\ncases of fully developed leprosy, which, according to his view, is\r\npre-eminently a taint of the blood,--a poison which can never again be\r\neradicated from the system. In cases of scrofula, these seeds have been\r\nfound serviceable.\r\n\r\nLike their brethren of the London Missionary Association, the various\r\nmissions of the United States of North America display the most\r\npraiseworthy zeal and activity of co-operation upon every question.\r\n\r\nThat eminent philanthropist, Dr. Bridgman, who had, for more than a\r\nquarter of a century, been an active and highly esteemed missionary, was\r\nin 1858 at the head of the American Episcopal Mission, and was one of the\r\noldest, as also among the most highly respected, denizens of the little\r\nforeign settlement. This meritorious citizen died at Shanghai, on the 29th\r\nof November, 1861, after having spent upwards of thirty years in China in\r\nthe promotion of the Christian faith and the advancement of knowledge,\r\ndeeply lamented by foreigners, as well as by the Chinese, who always found\r\nhim their true and confident friend. This gentleman had the kindness to\r\nassemble under his simple but kindly roof the various members of his\r\nmission, who are no less useful in increasing our acquaintance with the\r\nChinese language and literature than in diffusing the blessings of the\r\ngospel, thus furnishing the members of the _Novara_ Expedition with an\r\nopportunity of personal intercourse with these gentlemen. We here became\r\nacquainted with Mr. Wells Williams, so highly esteemed and so widely known\r\nfor his profound historical and philological works[147] respecting China,\r\nas also with Messrs. Syle, Aichison, Macy, Jones, and Blodgett,\r\nmissionaries distinguished for their extensive acquirements in Chinese;\r\nand in the course of this agreeable and interesting intercourse were so\r\nfortunate as to obtain information respecting a variety of topics, many of\r\nthem suggested by Dr. Pfitzmaier, and recommended by him to our\r\ninvestigation. On most of these topics accurate intelligence was in the\r\ncourse of our voyage transmitted to the Imperial Academy of Sciences; of\r\nthe remainder elaborate and comprehensive particulars are reserved for the\r\nscientific publications of the Expedition.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, more closely investigate here one topic of universal\r\ninterest, namely, the latest researches respecting the very remarkable,\r\nlittle known, half-savage tribe, known as the Miau-Tze.\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary human beings are usually encountered in the provinces\r\nof Kwei-chan, Yun-nan, Szechuen, Hunan, Kwang-si, and the western part of\r\nKwang-tung. The wild tribes of the island of Formosa belong, on the\r\ncontrary, to an entirely different race. In the Imperial Dictionary of\r\nKang-hi, the sign [Chinese character(s)], _miau_ (a compound of the words\r\n\"flower\" and \"meadow\"), signifies \"germinating seeds,\" \"blades of grass\r\nspringing from the seed-vessels.\" The sign [Chinese character(s)], _tsz_,\r\non the other hand, is that usually employed to express son, or descendant.\r\nIn accordance with this explanation, the Chinese also seem to consider the\r\nMiau-tze as children of the soil, as aborigines, or indigenous inhabitants\r\nof the country. In their descriptions of this singular people they divide\r\nthem into \"Sang\" and \"Schuh.\" _Sang_, ordinarily used when speaking of\r\nfruit, signifies \"green, unripe,\"--_schuh_ again means \"ripe,\" or, when\r\nspeaking of food, the former signifies \"raw,\" the latter \"thoroughly\r\ncooked.\" By these means they discriminate them into the savage independent\r\n\"green\" Miau-tze, and the subjugated more civilized \"ripe\" Miau-tze. The\r\nsubjection and civilization of these latter are however as yet very\r\nproblematical. As in days long gone by, so up to the present hour, the\r\nMiau-tze are restless and troublesome neighbours to the Chinese. Dr.\r\nBridgman has lately translated into English the sketches made by a Chinese\r\nscholar upon the Miau-tze, during his travels in the province of\r\nKwei-chan, by which he has added greatly to our stock of information\r\nrespecting those \"children of the soil;\" the work consists of two volumes\r\nin 8vo, containing about 82 sketches or delineations. Each of these fills\r\none page, the handwriting being condensed or expanded according to the\r\namount of the contents, while that opposite contains an illustration\r\nelucidatory of the text. This very rare work divides the Miau-tze into 82\r\ntribes according to their customs, more or less savage, very few of whom\r\npossess any trace of a written language, recording the most important\r\nevents simply by certain marks on a stick, or by what are called\r\n\"tallies,\" and subsisting upon wild fruit, fish, and the flesh of wild\r\nanimals. They usually go about barefooted, are very scantily clad, lead a\r\nlife full of privation and hardship, and in all their troubles have\r\nrecourse to the invocation of the evil spirits. Only very few of their\r\nrace follow agriculture, or any branch of industry, or worship Buddha in\r\ntheir festivals.[148] Some of these however seem to be more or less\r\ncrossed with Chinese blood, as, for example, the Tsche-Tsai-Miau, in the\r\ndistrict of Kutschan, whither the rebel Ma-san-pai formerly fled with 600\r\nof his followers, when his attempt, under his feudal leader, Mu-san-Kwei,\r\nto overthrow the reigning dynasty, failed of success. Many of these\r\nfugitives formed connections with the native women, and their descendants\r\nare now known by the name of the six hundred savage Miau families.\r\n\r\nAdjoining Dr. Bridgman's residence, is a school maintained at the expense\r\nof the mission, in which twenty-four Chinese girls are during five years\r\ninstructed in reading and writing their mother tongue, in arithmetic, and\r\nin the rudiments of Christianity, after which they are provided with a\r\nsmall portion and married to Chinese Christians of good character.\r\nSelected under the idea that very favourable results may be anticipated,\r\nif the various subjects in which the scholars are instructed are imparted\r\nto them in their native language, English is entirely omitted. Interesting\r\nand extraordinary, however, as it is to hear American ladies imparting\r\ninstruction in the Chinese language, this method of teaching has many\r\ndrawbacks, and the mission itself and society in general would derive far\r\nmore advantage, if these poor females should be instructed in English,\r\nthus widening the horizon of their knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the boys' school, also supported by the mission, another method of\r\nteaching is in use. The children learn an epistle first in Chinese,\r\nafterwards in English, when they are called upon to translate the Chinese\r\ninto English. Thus we heard one lad rehearse the Book of Ruth, first in\r\nChinese, and then in English. He was then examined in English upon the\r\nmeaning of certain passages, when he replied with great accuracy in the\r\nsame language. Education in these schools is mainly intrusted to ladies.\r\nTwo of these, Miss Jones and Miss Conover, displayed remarkable\r\nattainments in Chinese, besides their really marvellous store of\r\ninformation. None of the teachers are married, while none of the wives of\r\nthe missionaries interfere with the school, but employ themselves in\r\nsuperintending the education of their own children. We found forty Chinese\r\nboys receiving their education at the expense of the mission, whose\r\nparents have to sign a written engagement that they will not withdraw\r\ntheir children from the institution for a period of ten years, in fact,\r\ntill the completion of their education. This precaution is absolutely\r\nnecessary, owing to the fickle nature of the Chinese, else it would be a\r\nby no means rare occurrence for the parents to insist on the child\r\nreturning home, possibly just at the critical moment when the beneficent\r\ninfluence of Christian culture is beginning to spring up in the soul. On\r\nthe whole, this mission has splendid results to show. We saw one scholar,\r\nwho at present forms one of the staff of teachers, and speaks and writes\r\nEnglish absolutely better than his native language. Another young Chinese,\r\nsent out at the expense of the mission, spent eight years at Yale College\r\nin Massachusetts, and at present earns his maintenance by translating\r\nEnglish documents into Chinese and _vice versa_, for the mercantile houses\r\nof the place.\r\n\r\nDr. Bridgman is at once founder and president of the first scientific\r\nassociation in Shanghai, the \"North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety,\" including among its members almost all the foreigners resident\r\nin Shanghai, who assemble regularly every winter for intellectual and\r\nliterary recreation, and publish from time to time in a periodical of\r\ntheir own, details of the efforts, adventures, and experiences of their\r\ncolleagues in promoting the objects of the association.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary meeting was held in honour of the _Novara_ voyagers, at\r\nwhich about forty persons were present. The President, Dr. Bridgman,\r\nwelcomed our commander and his subordinates with a few cordial remarks,\r\nwhich was responded to by Commodore Wuellerstorff, after which the writer\r\nof these lines had the honour to deliver in English a brief address,\r\ntouching on the chief aims of the Expedition and its scientific objects,\r\nstating that its chief purpose was less the promotion of purely scientific\r\nknowledge, than by ample, long-continued practice to provide material of\r\nsuitable quality for our youthful budding navy, to unfurl the standard of\r\nAustria in localities where it had never before been seen, to effect\r\ntreaties of commerce with foreign nations, to knit the various capitals\r\nwhich we should visit in our cruise by the tie of science, to open\r\ncorrespondence with their various institutes, and to make collections,\r\nchiefly of those objects of natural history, the acquisition of which,\r\nowing to their great value or the difficulty of transport, is almost\r\nimpossible to the single traveller. The hearty reception which had been\r\naccorded the Expedition in Shanghai rendered it doubly incumbent on us to\r\nexplain the various purposes we had in view, and the original points of\r\ninquiry to which we were restricted by the track definitely assigned to\r\nus, as also to account for the shortness of our stay in each port, and the\r\nfact that our prescribed route led us sometimes to visit places either\r\npolitically or nautically well known.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of this short lecture, several of those present rose to\r\nspeak, amongst others the United States Plenipotentiary, Mr. Reed, who\r\nexpressed his sincere pleasure at having been privileged during his stay\r\nin China to meet with the commander of an Austrian frigate engaged with\r\nhis gallant companions in so grand a mission.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed spoke in high terms of the scientific exertions being made by\r\nGermany, and recalled in animated terms the splendid services of A. von\r\nHumboldt, whom the news of the death of Washington (14th Dec. 1799) found\r\nalready occupied in scientific research in the primeval forests of South\r\nAmerica, and who still (August, 1858) continued to display such marvellous\r\nintellectual activity.\r\n\r\nBesides Mr. Reed, we also made the personal acquaintance of the French\r\nPlenipotentiary, Baron Gros; the ambassadors of England and Russia were\r\nalready gone, the former to Japan, the latter to the Amur. We were\r\nintroduced to Baron Gros at the house of M. de Montigny, the French\r\nConsul, who during a residence of many years in China has occupied himself\r\nnot alone with upholding the prestige and influence of \"_la grande\r\nnation_,\" but has also rendered conspicuous services to science and\r\nagriculture. To him is due the credit of having in 1847 dispatched to\r\nEurope the first seeds of what is called the Chinese sugar-cane (_Sorghum\r\nsaccharatum_), and of having introduced to agriculturists that remarkable\r\nspecies of grass, with which, in consequence of its many useful qualities,\r\nhundreds of thousands of acres have since that period been planted in\r\nvarious parts of the globe. M. de Montigny distinguished the members of\r\nour Expedition in every way, and presented them with numerous specimens of\r\nseeds from Northern China.[149]\r\n\r\nThe visit paid to Baron Gros by two of the naturalists left by no means an\r\nagreeable impression. The French ambassador is a tall, commanding,\r\npowerfully-built man, about fifty years of age, with a full, round,\r\nbeardless face covered with freckles, and hair of a light colour. He\r\nseemed pleased to speak of himself and his connections, and repeatedly\r\nproclaimed himself an admirer of German men of science, who was in\r\ncorrespondence with M. von Humboldt. \"You know,\" quoth the Baron,\r\napparently desirous of explaining his meaning, \"he that wrote the Kosmos.\"\r\nThe two members of our Expedition coloured up; to pronounce the name of\r\nHumboldt to German men of science, and deem it necessary to state his\r\nliterary claims, was sufficiently embarrassing. One of them endeavoured to\r\nturn the conversation to the gulf of Petchi-li, whence Baron Gros had just\r\nreturned after the ratification of the treaty of peace. He showed them a\r\nhasty sketch of a portion of the great wall of China, to which he had paid\r\na visit when in the gulf of Petchi-li, and had made the sketch on the\r\nspot. The natives with whom he came in contact during his stay in the\r\nNorth he described as destitute and poor to an extraordinary degree, but\r\nanything but hostile to foreigners. They asked for with eagerness and\r\nseized with avidity the entrails of animals which the sailors were about\r\nto throw away; on empty bottles being thrown overboard, they swam a\r\nconsiderable distance to rescue them. With respect to the political events\r\nin the Pei-ho and Tien-Tsin, his Excellency, whether out of diplomatic\r\nreserve or for other reasons we do not know, preserved profound\r\nsilence.[150]\r\n\r\nA variety of circumstances, however, may have contributed to make the\r\nBaron less susceptible to every other thing than his everlasting \"I.\"\r\nBaron Gros had in fact been subjected to the very great inconvenience of\r\nthe Propellor _Audacieuse_, which had been brought from France, having\r\nsuddenly become unseaworthy, so that he had to abandon her. She was making\r\nfrom 100 to 140 tons of water per diem, and there was nothing for it but\r\nto have the vessel taken with all speed to the docks at Whampoa for\r\nrepairs, while the envoy had to return to Europe by another opportunity.\r\nMoreover, the Baron had been attacked by a disorder of common occurrence\r\nin hot countries, namely, a furuncle, which is exceedingly painful, and\r\nobstinately resists every remedy. Whoever is of a constitution liable to\r\nsuch attacks is never free from them till he gains a colder climate. In\r\nthe case of the unfortunate Baron, these went on continually increasing,\r\nand on one of his compatriots being asked in society what was the cause of\r\nthe absence of the French ambassador, replied with an arch look, \"_le\r\npauvre baron a quatre-vingt cloux_.\" In fact, the annoyance caused by this\r\nmalady is redoubled by the little sympathy accorded to those afflicted\r\nwith it, who are only rallied or laughed at.\r\n\r\nAnother personage who, at the period of our stay in Shanghai, attained a\r\nrather unenviable notoriety by his strange conduct, and did but little to\r\nraise the reputation of France in these latitudes, was the Marquis de\r\nChassiron. By his marriage with one of the Princesses Murat (since dead),\r\nhe was allied to the Emperor of the French, whom he occasionally spoke of\r\nin an off-hand way as \"mon neveu, l'Empereur.\" Meagre, wizen,\r\nspindle-shanked, and ringletted, in coloured check pantaloons, blue\r\nfrock, open-work cravat of Gros de Naples, and dancing-master's pumps,\r\nresembling much more a second-rate Paris dandy than a diplomatist, it\r\nseemed as though he must have been dispatched to this out-of-the-way part\r\nof the world for quite other than a diplomatic object, although he took\r\ngreat pains to spread the report that he had been appointed the successor\r\nof Baron Gros in the Embassy.\r\n\r\nOne day the Commodore and some members of the Expedition received an\r\ninvitation from the kind and hospitable English Consul, Mr. Brook\r\nRobertson, to be present at a reception at the Consulate of the Tau-Tai,\r\nor highest Chinese official of the city.[151]\r\n\r\nWe the more readily congratulated ourselves on this invitation, as, owing\r\nto the sudden departure of the Tau-Tai, we missed the opportunity of\r\npaying him a visit in his own palace in the city. Punctually at the\r\nappointed hour, 2 P.M., a formal procession was seen approaching the\r\nbuildings of the English Consulate. In front were carried numerous titles\r\nand insignia, then the Tau-Tai in a large and handsome sedan-chair, and\r\nfinally a noisy \"following,\" in the shape of a rabble of servants. Mr.\r\nRobertson received the Tau-Tai at the threshold of his house, and greeted\r\nhim with the customary Tschin-Tschin, moving the hands closely folded a\r\nfew times over the breast.\r\n\r\nAll present kept the head covered, making in like manner a few\r\nTschin-tschins, and then accompanied the visitor to the reception-room, in\r\nwhich were five stools, the seat of honour being on the left. As soon as\r\nthe Tau-Tai was seated, the rest took their seats, and a proposition was\r\nmade in consequence of the truly tropical heat, contrary to Chinese\r\nnotions of courtesy, to divest one's self of one's head-gear. The\r\nMandarin, at all events, seemed as little loth to lay aside his\r\nfunnel-shaped straw-cap, with its blue button and peacock's feather, as\r\nthe Europeans present to doff their uniform caps.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the commander and the author of this narrative by Mr.\r\nMeadows, who acted as interpreter, gave the Tau-Tai an opportunity of\r\ninquiring of the English Consul whether our frigate had been at the gulf\r\nof Petcheli. Mr. Robertson replied that the _Novara_ was the first\r\nwar-ship of a German power which had ever visited the Yang-tse-Kiang and\r\nWusung rivers, and that the frigate was bound on a voyage of scientific\r\ndiscovery. This led to a running fire of questions and answers, during the\r\ncourse of which two attendants were engaged alternately in filling a small\r\npipe with tobacco, which they handed to the Tau-Tai. The latter drew a few\r\npuffs, permitted the smoke to escape through his nostrils, after which\r\nhis pipe was again replenished with a small supply of tobacco.\r\n\r\nWe next had an example of the custom, already mentioned, of wiping the\r\nface with a hot damp towel, one of the attendants dipping a rather thick\r\npiece of linen cloth in a tub of hot water, which was then wrung out, when\r\nthe cloth was presented to the Mandarin, who, without in any way\r\ninterrupting the conversation, from time to time wiped the perspiration\r\nfrom his brow.\r\n\r\nThe Tau-Tai had a well-made, handsome figure, pleasing, rather\r\nintelligent, features, a round, smooth, delicate face, without any trace\r\nof beard, eyes as usual drawn up at the outer corner, small elegant hands,\r\nand beautifully tapered fingers, with very long nails. His dress was very\r\nsimple; he wore, for the sake of coolness, a shirt made of thin bamboo\r\nshoots, with a long, yellowish, loose surcoat, white drawers, and, instead\r\nof the usual Chinese shoe with its high cork soles, or white thick\r\ngaiters, he wore light shoes of European make. His head was covered with a\r\ncone-shaped straw-hat of very fine texture, with a red tassel and blue\r\nknot in the midst, and a dark green peacock's feather, extending\r\nhorizontally backwards.\r\n\r\nBusiness over, a table was covered, and the Tau-Tai invited to partake.\r\nAccording to the Chinese custom, only confectionery, preserves, and fruit\r\nwere handed round. The liquids consisted of sherry, liqueurs, Chinese wine\r\nor Samschoo (made from rice and imbibed from cups in lieu of glasses), and\r\ngreen and almond tea. The Mandarin drank to all present, and seemed to\r\ntake more to sherry and Maraschino than to his own native drinks. The slim\r\nliqueur bottle, with its neat gilt label and the thick cork stopper,\r\nseemed especially to attract his attention.\r\n\r\nAfter a few commonplace observations, the Tau-Tai once more turned the\r\nconversation upon Austria, and remarked he had never before heard of that\r\npower. Mr. Meadows endeavoured to prompt the memory of the Chinese\r\nofficial, produced Muirhead's universal geography translated into Chinese,\r\nturned up therein the section relating to Austria, and handed the book to\r\nthe Tau-Tai, who had the entire passage read to him by one of his\r\nattendants, that he might \"get up\" the country from which the strangers\r\nhad come who were seated on his left and right hands.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitiveness of every Chinese now displayed itself in a series of\r\ninquiries as to the principal products and articles of export of the\r\nEmpire, and he expressed a hope he should ere long see more of the\r\n\"Austrian Mandarins\" in Shanghai. The _Novara_ travellers on their side\r\nwith a patriotic pride, readily pardonable under the circumstances,\r\nendeavoured through the medium of the Government interpreter to leave the\r\nbest possible impression of their native country upon the mind of the\r\nTau-Tai, by giving a glowing description of the Austrian Empire, its\r\nnatural advantages, and its people. Of numbers the worthy man seemed to\r\nhave no definite idea, for the remark that the Empire contained (1st\r\nAugust, 1858) very nearly 40,000,000 inhabitants seemed greatly to\r\nastonish him, although this is probably barely one-tenth of the population\r\nof the Chinese Empire.[152]\r\n\r\nJust as the Tau-Tai was preparing to set out on his return, a tremendous\r\ntumult was suddenly heard in the street. It seemed like a popular\r\ninsurrection, and servants were forthwith sent out to ascertain the cause\r\nof this unexpected shindy, who came back presently with the intelligence\r\nthat an English sailor had struck a coolie of the suite a blow on the face\r\nwith his fist, so violent that he was seriously injured, and was bleeding\r\nprofusely. The Tau-Tai made his appearance on the portico. As soon as the\r\ninjured man saw his master approaching, he flung himself before him\r\nimploring aid, and exhibiting his face streaming with blood, and the wound\r\ngaping open. The Tau-Tai ordered the man to rise, and delivered him to the\r\nChinese police. Occasionally when a Chinese receives a wound in a quarrel\r\nof this nature he will abstain from wiping off the blood-stains from his\r\nface for weeks together, finding, it should seem, some satisfaction in\r\nbeing able to exhibit them. This done, the procession resumed its march.\r\nIn front strode a man who from time to time administered a sounding thwack\r\nto the gong, after which he rushed through the streets bawling like a\r\nStentor, that the people might crowd on one side and leave the Tau-Tai\r\nspace to pass unobstructed. The rear was brought up with police,\r\ncatch-poles with long bamboo poles, and the executioner with his axe--the\r\nnever-failing attendant on such occasions,--who accompanies it, however,\r\nonly as a sort of allegorical personage, to impress upon the yelling\r\ncrowds around the consequences of disobedience, and of rebellion against\r\nconstituted authority.\r\n\r\nThe only important excursion we made from Shanghai was to the Jesuit\r\nMission of Sikkawei, twelve miles distant. Our excellent host, Mr. James\r\nHogg, of the well-known firm of Lindsay and Co.,[153] and Consul for the\r\nHanse towns, to whose great kindness we are deeply indebted, was so kind\r\nas to order his pretty little yacht _Flirt_ to be got ready for our\r\naccommodation, and we set off, accompanied by the heroic Mr. Gray, of the\r\nAmerican house of Russell and Co., who lost one foot while fighting\r\nagainst the Tai-ping rebels before the very gates of Shanghai. As the\r\nEuropeans are in the habit of using these pleasure-boats as residences\r\nduring their visit to the interior, so as not to be dependent upon the\r\nsomewhat uncertain hospitality of the Chinese, they are provided with\r\nevery accessory to comfort, being fitted with a neat cabin, a small\r\nlibrary, boudoir, berth-cabin, &c. They usually carry an immense spread of\r\ncanvas, and during calms are propelled like the native boats with one big\r\noar from the stern, which serves at the same time as a rudder. The sail up\r\nthe Wusung, in which upwards of a hundred sail of merchantmen, and above a\r\nthousand junks, were lying at anchor, was very interesting. Many of the\r\njunks lying off the Catholic cathedral of Tonka-du displayed a flag with a\r\nwhite cross on a black ground, in token of the religious faith of the\r\ncrew. Here also we saw for the first time some Siamese ships, built in\r\nSiam, for the most part on European models. Of these we counted eleven. By\r\nway of ensign, they had an elephant rather nicely drawn, sometimes on a\r\nred, sometimes on a blue field, according to the fancy or the taste of the\r\nowner. These vessels have Siamese crews and English captains, and are\r\narmed with ten or twelve cannon, so that his Siamese Majesty can at a\r\nmoment's notice use his little fleet of merchantmen for warlike purposes.\r\n\r\nThe channel, 200 or 300 fathoms wide, which unites the Wusung with the\r\ninternal network of small rivers, is called the Wuang-Po, a designation\r\nwhich some authorities assume to be the name of its constructor, while\r\nothers maintain that it is derived from _wong_, yellow, and applies to the\r\ncolour of the water, just as Whampoa, near Canton, signifies the yellow\r\nanchorage. Nothing has so much contributed to that immense activity of\r\ncommerce, which we marvel at among the Chinese, as their vast canal\r\nsystem, the introduction of which was pursued with such energy in the 7th\r\ncentury.[154] The innumerable artificial canals, with which the whole\r\nnorth of China is intersected, and which by their admirably planned system\r\nof arrangement unite all the lakes and navigable rivers of the Empire with\r\neach other, make it possible to voyage through every province of the\r\nEmpire without having once to leave the boat. They atone for the great\r\nwant of good roads, and even make the absence of railroads less\r\nperceptible in a country where the value of labour is so unprecedentedly\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we leave Shanghai behind, with its immense commercial fleet,\r\nthe scenery beyond becomes tame. The banks on either side are low, and far\r\nas the eye can reach not a single hill is to be seen, not even a rising\r\nslope--nothing but a flat alluvial soil, every inch of which seems\r\ndiligently tilled, or otherwise made useful.\r\n\r\nAfter we had sailed several miles in the _Flirt_ we came to a branch of\r\nthe great canal, where we shifted into a smaller but not less elegant\r\nboat, the property of Mr. Gray, which drew less water, and in which we\r\nwere to reach the Jesuit mission. At this season, however, owing to the\r\nlowness of the water, navigation was only continued with great difficulty,\r\nand notwithstanding the astonishing dexterity with which our worthy Lau-tu\r\n(the old chief) conned our craft through the sharp bends of the river, we\r\nwere at last compelled to halt, and perform the rest of the distance,\r\nabout two miles, on foot.\r\n\r\nWe now found ourselves strolling through fields planted with rice and\r\ncotton, through cabbage and vegetable gardens, occasionally even over\r\ngraves, which rose in mounds here and there along our path. Sometimes in\r\nthe distance we could descry small villages and solitary farm-houses.\r\n\r\nIn Sikkawei we found about twenty Jesuits, French and Italians, all of\r\ngenuine Chinese appearance, with heads half-shaved, long queues stretching\r\nto the ground, loose yellow clothes, and velvet shoes with thick cork\r\nsoles. This had a striking, almost theatrical effect. We were ushered into\r\nthe reception-room, and there offered refreshment. The conversation soon\r\nbecame brisk, which added to the singularity of the scene, as the seeming\r\nChinese, sitting in a circle round the table, and smoking perfumed tobacco\r\nout of small long-stemmed pipes, began, in fluent French or liquid\r\nItalian, to discuss Paris, Naples, Vienna, or politics and art.\r\n\r\nThis Mission is supported by the Propaganda of Rome, as also by voluntary\r\ncontributions. About 80 pupils, chiefly children of poor parents, are\r\ninstructed in the Chinese language and literature, in reading, writing,\r\narithmetic, and drawing, and in the tenets of the Roman Catholic faith; on\r\nthe other hand, little anxiety is manifested for their instruction in\r\nFrench or English, or in providing them with any practical mechanical\r\ninstruction. In this mode of education the main object seems to be to\r\nenable the students more readily to reach the highest offices in the state\r\nby imparting to them a thorough grounding in Chinese literature, and by\r\nthese means to ensure for them religious influence and protection.\r\nAccordingly, strenuous efforts are made to increase the number of\r\nscholars, and in order to facilitate this aim, as in the case of the\r\nIndians of Central and Southern America, their observance of various\r\nheathen rites is connived at, as, for example, the worship of their\r\nancestors, the ceremonies at the death of a relation, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nOne branch of art, in which some of the scholars have, owing to their\r\nhaving naturally a turn for it, attained considerable proficiency, is\r\nwood-engraving. In the church attached to the Mission are shown a number\r\nof altar-ornaments, chiefly figures very beautifully carved in wood, the\r\nwork of a Jesuit of Spanish extraction, whose talent and enthusiasm seem\r\nto have laid the foundation of this school of image-carvers. In what is\r\ncalled the model-room are numbers of figures and busts designed by the\r\npractised hand of the brother alluded to. Here too are some heads of the\r\nSaviour, very beautifully executed in clay by the Chinese scholars, as\r\nalso Madonnas, busts of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and the Emperor\r\nNapoleon III. These are doubly extraordinary, when we remember the slight\r\ninstruction and very scanty assistance bestowed on them while in course of\r\nexecution; their actual value however is small, for at present, as none of\r\nthe Jesuits in the Mission have any very decided taste for the art,\r\ninstruction in it has almost entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of the present members of the Society of Jesus, in China,\r\nsuffer greatly, measured by the standard of what was accomplished by their\r\nrenowned brethren in previous centuries; one looks in vain for the high\r\nattainments, the self-sacrificing zeal, the practical talents of other\r\ntimes, and Sikkawei, with its present spiritual occupants, cannot leave a\r\nvery pleasing impression on any unprejudiced Catholic. There is an utter\r\nlack of all those qualities which once formed the renown and the title to\r\nadmiration of the Jesuits in China. One looks for, but fails to find, a\r\nlibrary corresponding to the dignity of the Mission, or mathematical or\r\nmedical instruments, or a chemical laboratory: in lieu of these there seem\r\nto prevail a deficiency of Christian toleration for these unmistakeable\r\nadjuncts of true education and enlightenment. At all events, we judged as\r\nmuch from a remark made by the brother who accompanied us round the\r\nbuilding, who spoke some words in Chinese to the gaping crowd of\r\nlong-tailed scholars, who kept pressing upon us, and then turning to us,\r\nobserved in French,--\"I have informed our pupils that our present guests\r\nare Roman Catholics, and therefore _true_ Christians, because we\r\noccasionally have English visitors at the Mission, and they are heretics.\"\r\nApparently the intolerant padre was reckoning without his host, for there\r\nwere several Protestants among the party!\r\n\r\nThroughout the province of Kaing-su there are at present 80,000 Chinese\r\nCatholics, that is to say, who profess Catholicism, though having but a\r\nvery superficial idea of its spirit and its reality.\r\n\r\nIn returning to our boat we availed ourselves of the mode of conveyance in\r\nmost common use in China, the sedan-chair, or couch. The ordinary\r\nsedan-chair differs little in exterior form and interior arrangement from\r\nthose still occasionally used in some of the out-of-the-way, old-fashioned\r\ntowns, both of Germany and England. Owing to the extreme cheapness of\r\nlabour, the least well-to-do classes of Chinese are able to avail\r\nthemselves of these convenient conveyances, the use of which is doubly\r\nagreeable in such a hot climate. Indeed, long journeys are very frequently\r\nmade by this mode of transport. As a rule, the sedan-bearers get over from\r\ntwenty to twenty-five miles per diem, charging for that distance one\r\ndollar, in addition to their food, consisting of tea, rice, vegetables,\r\nand cakes. Baggage and merchandise of all sorts are conveyed by coolies,\r\neach carrying with ease 110 _catties_, equal to 146 lbs. With such a\r\nburthen he will trudge over lofty mountain passes, and without much effort\r\nwill cover thirteen miles a day. If special dispatch is required, the\r\nburthen must be reduced one-half, when the coolie, keeping at the trot,\r\nwill get over double the distance in one day; what is gained in speed\r\nbeing lost in power.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Shanghai, we visited the celebrated six-storied Pagoda,\r\nLong-Sah, which is traditionally said to have been erected about A.D. 250,\r\nduring the period of the Three Empires. Of all the Pagodas hitherto known,\r\nnot even excepting the well-known specimen at Canton, it is the best\r\npreserved, and forms one massive, wide quadrangular tower, about 150 feet\r\nhigh, arranged in six stories, one of which has running around it a richly\r\ncarved balcony. The pyramidal roof has turned-up angles, to which are\r\nsuspended bells, which when agitated by the wind give forth their music.\r\nFrom the highest story, to which access is obtained by a stone staircase,\r\nthere is a rather agreeable, pretty extensive view over the country, and\r\nits cultivated surface, stretching away till, at 200 miles from Shanghai,\r\nto the north and north-west, rises a range of mountains, of which of\r\ncourse not a glimpse is to be seen hence, the prospect in this direction\r\nhaving no defined limit. This panoramic view gives an excellent idea of\r\nthe characteristics of a Chinese landscape, the various methods of\r\ncultivation, the situation of the valleys, and, above all, the ceaseless\r\ntide of traffic, as evidenced by the almost innumerable artificial\r\nwater-channels which intersect the country in every direction. Quite close\r\nto the Pagoda is a Buddha temple, the well-known Lung-hwo, erected A.D.\r\n230. Of the seventy Buddhist and Taouist temples of the province this is\r\nthe largest and most beautiful. The rear of the edifice is adorned with\r\ncountless figures, sometimes of colossal dimensions, in wood, plaster, and\r\nporcelain, richly carved and gilt. There is also a female statue among\r\nthese Chinese saints, the attitude strongly suggestive of a Madonna.\r\n\r\nThis temple is plainly in connection with the Pagoda, and the various\r\nsmall chambers behind it seem to have been destined for the accommodation\r\nof priests and devout pilgrims. According to an old Chinese tradition this\r\ntemple owes its erection to the following circumstance:--a queen from the\r\nsouth, who had anchored her boat one night in the Whampoa Channel near\r\nWusung, suddenly beheld a light shoot up amid the tall grass, and rise\r\ntowards heaven, in consequence of which she gave orders for a temple to be\r\nbuilt on the site.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting episodes of our stay at Shanghai consisted in\r\na genuine Chinese banquet, given by a wealthy native merchant, named\r\nTa-ki, a warm friend of all foreigners, in honour of the Austrian\r\nExpedition. The huge invitation cards, written, according to the usual\r\npractice of the country, in Chinese characters upon blood-red paper, and\r\nfolded in envelopes of the same brilliant hue, were sent round to the\r\nresidences of the guests some days beforehand.\r\n\r\nAt 8 P.M. the feast began. Ta-ki's house, like those of all the wealthy\r\nChinese, is surrounded by a massive wall, six or seven feet in height, and\r\npainted white. After passing through a narrow gateway, the visitor finds\r\nhimself at once in the usual apartments. These were adorned for the\r\noccasion with large coloured lanterns, which despite their numbers shed a\r\nmild and most agreeable light.[155] Along the walls, which were richly\r\ngilt, hung quantities of sententious native maxims, written with Indian\r\nink, sometimes in Chinese characters, sometimes in Tartar, on white or\r\nyellow rolls of paper. The greatest attention appeared to have been paid\r\nto the preparation of the reception-room, whose form was a rather narrow\r\noblong, in which at the far end was erected a platform, where a strolling\r\ncompany acted Chinese theatricals. The musicians sat on the stage. The\r\ncompany belonged to one of those innumerable wandering troops which are\r\nengaged for a day or two now by the community, now by wealthy Mandarins,\r\nto give some theatrical representations, which it seems must in China\r\nform the accompaniment of every important event, whether joyous or\r\nsorrowful.\r\n\r\nAt those performances which are given in public, the multitude is admitted\r\ngratis, and of this privilege they avail themselves to the utmost. Each\r\nman selects the best seat for himself, on the street, in a tree, or on a\r\nroof. Mandarins, however, and rich private individuals have their own\r\nlittle stage scenes in the interior of their usually spacious mansions, in\r\nwhich from time to time they have theatrical representations for the\r\namusement of a small circle of friends. Some Mandarins even go the length\r\nof having their own players, who receive regular annual pay, and form part\r\nof the household.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the very extensive collections of Chinese plays, with\r\nseveral of which the learned classes of Europe have been made acquainted\r\nby the valuable labours of Julien, Bazin, Remusat, and others, there are\r\nbut a very few of true literary value. The plot of most of them is\r\nexceedingly simple, the actors themselves specify the characters they are\r\nto play; between each scene there is usually a lack of connection, and\r\nfrequently the most telling scenes and situations are marred by the most\r\narrant trash, or the coarsest jests. Only a very small number of these\r\nrise above the level of the buffoonery of former ages, and judging by the\r\naccounts given by travellers, who have been present at such entertainments\r\nin even the large cities, including Pekin itself, the dramatic art would\r\nas yet seem to be in its infancy in China.[156] The company which was\r\nassembled in the hospitable mansion of Ta-ki, to do honour to the members\r\nof the _Novara_ Expedition, was not calculated to impress them favourably\r\nwith the scope of the Chinese drama. The piece appointed consisted of\r\nevents in the ancient history of China, for which Chinese dramatic poets\r\nhave a special predilection, owing to the abundance of material from which\r\nto choose, although the multitude seem to have but little sympathy with\r\nit. Even our host, who spoke the Canton-English, as it is called, could\r\ngive us but little explanation or enlightenment as to the plot, and\r\ncontented himself with repeatedly remarking that the piece related to\r\n\"old, old times!\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the universal custom, according to which women are not\r\npermitted to enter a theatre, so that even the female characters have to\r\nbe played by men dressed to represent the part, the majority of the\r\npresent troupe were girls of from 14 to 20 years of age, who, stained red\r\nor white, and elegantly arrayed, appeared mostly in Mandarin dresses on\r\nthe stage. The most outrageously absurd of the scenes were those most in\r\nfavour with the numerous domestics who, besides the invited guests, formed\r\nthe audience. Thus, there was a roar of laughter when a nurse entered with\r\na child in her arms, which had the face of an old soldier, with grey\r\nbeard, whiskers, and moustachios. They sang a long, rather melancholious\r\nditty, and then retired, without there appearing to be the slightest\r\nconnection between this and the following scene. We noted the evident\r\npredilection of the Chinese actors for a high-pitched falsetto tone of\r\nvoice when speaking, which, by the way, must render their assumption of\r\nfemale parts much more easy, and on the present occasion they probably\r\nwere desirous of giving us a specimen of their skill in this\r\naccomplishment. The music on such occasions is, if possible, even more\r\ndiscordant and monotonous than the delivery, and is not confined to merely\r\naccompanying the couplets, but continues to play during the intervals till\r\nthe ear is utterly wearied.\r\n\r\nAt the close of each act a large board covered with a red cloth was\r\nbrought on the stage and placed beneath the feet of the actors; on this\r\nthe steward of the house placed a present for the troupe about four\r\ndollars' worth of copper _cash_, which was forthwith carried away. This\r\nwas apparently the only intimation to most of the spectators that a piece\r\nwas ended, and a fresh one about to begin.\r\n\r\nAfter these theatrical representations had lasted about an hour and a half\r\na long pause ensued. One longed to escape outside into the fresh air, to\r\nget rid of the wearying sensation of the performances, and the stifling\r\nheat which prevailed in the room. The guests were at liberty to walk\r\nwithout obstruction through the various apartments of the extensive\r\nresidence, and accordingly stumbled upon rooms which are usually, as it\r\nwere, hermetically sealed to a foreigner, viz. the apartments of the\r\nwomen. Ta-ki carried his hospitality even this length, and presented us to\r\nhis wives, as also to his grey-haired mother, seventy years old, for whom\r\nhe showed the utmost love and respect. Ta-ki's wives, four or five in\r\nnumber, had \"assisted\" at the theatrical performances, each seated on\r\nelevated seats expressly prepared for them, and behaved with the greatest\r\ncourtesy and ease of manner. They seemed not to have the slightest thought\r\nof showing off, or of tittering or joking with the strangers. All were\r\nattired in silk, and most tastefully decorated with jewels; all had the\r\nusual painfully distorted small feet, which greatly interfered with their\r\npowers of locomotion. They did not attend at the banquet, but had their\r\nfood served in the private apartments.\r\n\r\nFor supper the quondam theatre was converted into a banqueting-hall. But\r\nthere was no long wide table set out as in Europe, only small\r\nfour-cornered tables covered with red cloth, at each of which three\r\nEuropeans and one Chinese took their seats; the duty of the latter being\r\nto do the honours to his companions in the name of the host, who took his\r\nseat beside the Commodore, and to minister to their comfort.\r\n\r\nAs it was the object to give us the most accurate idea possible of a\r\ngenuine Chinese repast, everything was eliminated which could in any way\r\ninterfere with the design, and we had accordingly to begin with dessert\r\nand conclude with the soup, as also to convey the various descriptions of\r\nfood to our mouths with thin strips of ivory (\"chop-sticks\"), instead of\r\nknives and forks.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of Chinese usages, so directly opposed to those of Europe,\r\nbecame likewise strikingly apparent in the course of the meal. And as in\r\nChina the mark of courtesy is to keep the head covered instead of removing\r\nthe hat, so the place of honour is on the left hand; the ancestors are\r\nennobled instead of the descendants (which is at once more sensible and\r\nmore economical); the characters in writing run from right to left instead\r\nof the reverse; the mourning colour is white instead of black; the natives\r\ncarefully extirpate every sign of a beard, instead of cherishing it as a\r\nsymbol of mature, dignified manhood; thus also meals begin with the food\r\nwith which we terminate ours, confectionery and fruit. When we were all\r\nseated, each table was forthwith covered with a profusion of the most\r\nvaried dishes on beautiful plates of stained porcelain, and while we were\r\nstill engaged in attempting to discover the mysterious ingredients of\r\nthese, the Chinese who was doing the honours at our table was exerting\r\nhimself to select and lay before us the most dainty morsels of each dish.\r\nIn performing this part of his functions he thought only to act with more\r\ncare and attention, in drawing each of the twain chop-sticks between his\r\nown lips and withdrawing them before he fished up a fresh piece and laid\r\nit on our plate! The dexterity with which all Chinese use these\r\nchop-sticks, which are usually made of ivory, ebony, or bamboo, borders\r\non the marvellous. In their hands, held between their fingers, they become\r\nlike a pair of pincers, with which they can pick up the smallest objects,\r\nand can eat rice-grains, beans, or peas as easily as they can separate the\r\nflakes of a fish from its skin, or remove the shell of a hard-boiled egg.\r\n\r\nAs to the ingredients of the dishes presented, we must frankly avow that\r\nby far the greater number were utterly unknown to us, for the Chinese\r\ncuisine, oddly enough, sets great store on making the materials\r\nunrecognizable, and altering their natural flavour by various recipes and\r\nculinary mysteries. According to the inquiries which we made of our\r\ncarver, our host seemed so anxious to fulfil to the letter his promise to\r\ngive us a real Chinese repast, that he had resolved on not sparing us a\r\nsingle one of the rarer dainties of Chinese epicures. Thus we not only had\r\nswallows' nests, lapwings' eggs, and steamed frogs, but also roasted\r\nsilk-worms, shark-fins, stag and buffalo tendons, biche-de-mar, bamboo\r\nroots, sea-weed, half-fledged chickens, and various other natural\r\ndelicacies. The table was supplied at least three times with fresh\r\ndelicacies, and we believe we do not exaggerate when we estimate the\r\nnumber of different dishes at not less than half a hundred. Meat of all\r\nsorts was at a discount, and was served up in small morsels ready\r\ncarved;[157] on the other hand, rice and vegetables were presented in\r\nevery imaginable form. During the meal one young girl, who had played a\r\npart in the dramas, was incessantly occupied with filling for each guest a\r\nvery small cup with a warm beverage distilled from millet, thus carrying\r\nout the code of Chinese civility, that the cup should never be suffered to\r\nbe empty, and therefore, that however little has once been drunk it must\r\nforthwith be replenished. Of the juice of the grape the Chinese make no\r\nuse, although there are many districts in the country which are eminently\r\nadapted to the growth of the vine. All the native drinks consist of\r\nnothing but poor-flavoured, highly-perfumed drinks, chiefly distilled from\r\nmillet and rice, and known by the general name of Samshoo, although this\r\nname is solely applicable to that obtained from rice, which somewhat\r\nresembles arrack. After the meal is over there are no spirits presented,\r\nbut only tea, usually the common green tea, or else a tea prepared from\r\nalmonds. The Chinese are, on the whole, a very temperate people, and even\r\ntheir passion for smoking opium is rather a vice among the masses of the\r\ncoast provinces and the large towns, than of the interior of the kingdom.\r\nDuring the banquet, as well as after it, there were further theatrical\r\nexhibitions, but the guests, who had been sufficiently wearied with the\r\nfirst of these, preferred to retire quietly to their own residences, and,\r\nseated in a rocking-chair on the delicious verandah, to recall all the\r\npeculiarities of the entertainment at which they had been present.\r\n\r\nThe rites of hospitality to strangers were not, however, limited in\r\nfulfilment to Ta-ki, since the various consuls settled at Shanghai, as\r\nwell as several of the English, American, and German merchants, invited\r\nthe members of the Expedition to dinner-parties given in their honour,\r\neach vying with the rest in refined courtesy. An especially pleasant\r\nmemory attaches to one indication of this feeling, the spontaneous\r\noffering of a number of Germans to our commander and his associates. We\r\nwere sitting in the house of Mr. James Hogg, the Hanseatic Consul, when\r\nfrom the garden there suddenly arose a serenade of men's voices, singing\r\nGerman melodies. Surprised and deeply affected, the entire company rose\r\nfrom table and strolled into the garden, but the serenaders were concealed\r\nbehind a group of trees, and as they withdrew, singing, the last cadence\r\nof a thrilling patriotic song was heard melting in the distance!\r\n\r\nThe Germans already constitute a by no means inconsiderable portion of the\r\nforeign community of China, and it is painful to observe what slender\r\nencouragement and support their energy and industry have as yet met with\r\nfrom the various governments of Germany. The number of Bremen ships which\r\nvisited the harbour of Shanghai has of late years equalled that of the\r\nUnited States, and would be very greatly increased if the German\r\nmercantile community and the home-shippers to the Chinese market could\r\ndepend upon protection such as the English and French can rely upon. The\r\nGerman States, such, for instance, as the Hanseatic Towns, Prussia,\r\nOldenburg, have indeed unsalaried Consuls here, but the shrewd, material\r\nChinese people require something more than an empty intercession--they\r\nrequire to be convinced by an unmistakeable physical ability to back these\r\nrepresentatives. Many a crying injustice, which the helpless German\r\nmerchants and ship captains have to put up with without hope of redress in\r\nthe various ports of China, would not and dare not occur if but a single\r\nGerman ship-of-war were stationed in Chinese waters. What the effect is,\r\nunder similar circumstances, of even one single small boat was well\r\nillustrated by Mr. Alcock, formerly the English Consul at Shanghai,[158]\r\nwho with a small English brig blocked the mouth of the Yang-tse-kiang, and\r\ndid not suffer one single \"junk\" of the many hundreds stationed in the\r\nriver to put to sea under threat of firing into them until the Chinese\r\nGovernment had paid attention to his demands, and surrendered for trial by\r\nan English tribunal the murderers of an English missionary. The bare\r\nmenace of closing the river sufficed to secure the Consul in his rights,\r\nand he speedily saw his various demands complied with. Only a month or two\r\nlater a Bremen captain sustained such severe losses through the wilful act\r\nof the Chinese Government that he had to sell his ship, the energetic\r\nprotest of his Consul to the native authorities meeting no other\r\nattention than an insulting chuckle over the powerlessness of the German\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the Treaty of Pekin securing to Europeans the\r\nunobstructed navigation of all canals and rivers throughout the Celestial\r\nEmpire, the trade with China is becoming so rapidly developed, that some\r\nremedy of this sort is imperatively needed,--if German commerce and\r\nindustry would avoid receiving a serious check, if she would not be\r\nsupplanted by other and more fortunate nations, in the endeavour to avail\r\nherself of the great alteration for the better in the facilities for trade\r\nin China.\r\n\r\nThe activity and energy of the English in opening up new outlets for their\r\nnative manufactures were here astonishingly visible. Hardly are the\r\nratifications of peace exchanged, opening the most important rivers and\r\nharbours of the Empire to free commerce with the subjects of England, ere\r\nthe country has been surveyed and explored in every direction. A number of\r\nEnglish merchants ascended the Yang-tse-kiang as far as Hang-kow[159]\r\n(mouth of trade), a city containing several millions of inhabitants,\r\nwhich, in consequence of its extraordinarily advantageous site, has\r\nalready been described by Huc as the chief emporium of the 18 Provinces,\r\nand whence all the foreign trade radiates into the interior. Others\r\nundertook a land journey from Canton to Hang-kow; a third company ascended\r\nthe Pei-ho and visited Tien-Tsin, while yet a fourth were contemplating\r\nthe formidable undertaking of boating it up the Yang-tse-kiang from\r\nShanghai to Hang-kow, whence they thought of penetrating via Thibet into\r\nBritish India.[160] Already information has been obtained from a variety\r\nof these excursions, which were undertaken specially in the interests of\r\ncommerce, such as justify the most glowing expectations as to the trade\r\nwith the Yang-tse-kiang and the Pei-ho.[161] Hang-kow promises to be a\r\nmost important depot for the exportation of tea, while Tien-Tsin promises\r\nto be not less important as an entrepot for the importation of\r\nmanufactures of every description. By the opening of these two additional\r\nharbours, Shanghai and Canton will fall off in their ratio of increase\r\nhitherto, but general commerce will on the whole receive a new impulse.\r\n\r\nTo the merchant and shipper, the latest intelligence from China as to the\r\nenormous development of commerce and trade at numerous spots of the\r\nCentral Empire, hitherto undisturbed by European civilization, must be\r\npositively astounding. It is a rich mine of the most valuable material,\r\nwhich the _China Overland Trade Report_ and the _North China Herald_\r\npresents to its readers, rendered doubly valuable through the influence\r\nof that Freedom of Speech, which makes every mercantile nation participate\r\nin the very latest information as to these experiments and their results.\r\nFor, so far as concerns our present direct intercourse with China, a time\r\nmust come, when more accurate notions will penetrate into even Austrian\r\ncommercial circles as to the wants of a population, and the natural wealth\r\nof an empire, which embraces a superficial area of 3,000,000 square miles,\r\nwith a population of 400,000,000 souls, and whose entire foreign commerce\r\nalready amounts to L36,000,000, apart from the impulse which recent events\r\nmust lend it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the immense variety of natural products of the Chinese\r\nEmpire, the chief articles of export hitherto have been tea and silk, and\r\nwe shall therefore confine our attention to a few important particulars as\r\nto those two articles.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of silk cultivation into China, one of the most ancient\r\nindustrial pursuits of the Empire, is due, if we are to believe a native\r\nlegend, to the consort of the Emperor Hwang-te, who reigned B.C. 2640. The\r\nfirst mention of the mulberry tree and of silk occurs in the\r\nSchoo-kiu,[162] \"the Book of exalted solid learning--the Book of Books,\"\r\nas it were, a collection of the most ancient historical annals of the\r\nChinese Empire, which was compiled B.C. 484, by Confucius, from the\r\nmemoranda of former writers of history, as well as from the information\r\nfurnished by ancient monuments. Even empresses in those halcyon times did\r\nnot deem it beneath their dignity to collect mulberry-leaves and feed the\r\nsilk-worms, while various treatises were composed by imperial pens,\r\nrespecting the cultivation of that most useful plant. The interest taken\r\nin silk-rearing by these the highest personages in the Empire, has\r\nremained unbroken to our own day, and quite recently a Chinese governor\r\nenriched the already copious literature upon this subject with a\r\ncomprehensive work, written with the laudable object of stimulating the\r\ninhabitants of the silk-producing districts to a more extensive and\r\nimproved system of silk cultivating.\r\n\r\nThe two best species of mulberry, those which are best adapted for the\r\nconsumption of the worm, are: \"Loo\" (_Morus alba_), with long leaves,\r\nlittle fruit, and firm roots, which flourishes chiefly in North China, and\r\n\"King\" (_Morus nigra_), with narrow leaves, more abundant fruit, and\r\naltogether a hardier plant, which grows chiefly in the South.\r\n\r\nAccording to old Chinese notions, there are eight different species of\r\nsilk-worm, which spin their cocoons at various periods[163] of the year\r\nbetween April and November.\r\n\r\nThe chief silk districts lie in the northern part of the province of\r\nTsche-Kiang, and the principal silk marts are the following cities:\r\nHoo-chow-foo, Hang-chow-foo, Keahing-fu, Nantsin, and Shoo-hing, which lie\r\nin a sort of semi-circle about 150 miles from Shanghai.\r\n\r\nThe silk is not grown in China by wealthy landed proprietors, and \"thrown\"\r\nin huge establishments, but by millions of husbandmen, each of whom calls\r\nbut a small patch of land his own, and plants it with mulberry trees,\r\nthus, like the bee, contributing his own share towards increasing the\r\nuniversal stock. During the season specially devoted to the silk-worm, old\r\nand young, lofty and lowly, throughout the silk districts, are busily and\r\nearnestly engaged night and day in tending the worms and winding off the\r\nsilk. When the crop is being gathered in, the chief merchants send their\r\nagents to all parts of the chief silk districts, in order to collect and\r\nbuy up these small quantities (varying greatly in value, as may be readily\r\nimagined), and depositing them in regularly assigned warehouses, where\r\nthey can be sorted according to quality. This done, the silk is packed in\r\nbales of 80 _catties_, or about 106 lbs. weight, and conveyed to Shanghai\r\nfor sale, where it is once more subjected in each mercantile house to the\r\nexamination of the special \"silk Inspectors,\" or \"Testers,\" after passing\r\nthrough whose hands, it is sorted according to quality for shipment to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThree distinct qualities of raw silk are known in commerce, viz. Tsatli\r\n[Chinese character(s)], Taysam [Chinese character(s)] (the big worm), and\r\nYuen-wha, or Yuen-fa [Chinese character(s)] (the flower of the garden).\r\nThese three leading descriptions are again subdivided into a great number\r\nof sorts, which are usually known by the name of the trader, or his \"hong\"\r\n(business).\r\n\r\nThe annual production of silk in China is estimated to amount to from\r\n200,000 to 250,000 bales, or from 20,000,000 to 25,000,000 pounds' weight.\r\nThis, however, is a very superficial estimate; that silk cultivation,\r\nhowever, must be enormously developed in China is obvious, not alone from\r\nthe immense home consumption of the article, but also from the\r\ncircumstance that, notwithstanding the immense increase in exports during\r\nthe last ten years, the price of silk has not merely remained stationary,\r\nbut is on an average absolutely less than at a period when barely\r\none-fourth of the quantity now exported found its way to England and\r\nFrance. The price of silk is usually reckoned in Taels,[164] on the\r\nestimate of a bale averaging 100 lbs. English. Between Shanghai and London\r\nthe bale loses on the average three per cent. in weight. There is also\r\nusually an allowance made of 15 per cent. for cost of transport and\r\nincidental charges from Shanghai to any English port.\r\n\r\nOn the average only one-fourth of the entire quantity of silk produced in\r\nChina, or about 6,000,000 lbs., is exported annually, of which by far the\r\nlargest quantity, perhaps as much as nine-tenths, goes to England and\r\nFrance. In 1843-44, the total export from all China was only 5100 bales.\r\nIn 1859, the export of raw silk from Shanghai alone was 75,652 bales!\r\n\r\nBesides the raw silk there are annually exported from China a large\r\nquantity of silk-stuffs manufactured in China, crape shawls, &c. &c., to\r\nthe value of from L400,000 to L500,000, the majority of which find a\r\nmarket in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe social condition of the Chinese silk-spinner is not less deplorable\r\nand poverty-stricken than that of the workmen of Europe, who are similarly\r\nengaged in the preparation of this costly article of luxury. As in Lyons,\r\nin Spitalfields, or among the Silesian Mountains, the Chinese silk-weaver\r\nlives and dies in the most abject misery, and the delicate and beautiful\r\nfabrics of his loom are produced in a wretched hut of such mean\r\ndimensions, that he is sometimes compelled to dig a hole in the soil in\r\norder to find room for the treadle. However, the Chinese weaver appears in\r\nso far better off than the same handicraftsman in Europe, that he has less\r\nto dread from the severity of the climate, and can purchase more food,\r\neven though his remuneration be smaller, than the weaver can possibly do\r\nin Europe, owing to the much higher price of even the commonest\r\nnecessities of life.\r\n\r\nThe recent revolution in Chinese foreign relations will exercise a\r\npermanent influence on the silk culture of China, and, considering the\r\nexceedingly low rate of wages in that country, the time cannot be far\r\ndistant, when one may purchase Chinese silk in Europe more cheaply than\r\nhome-grown silk, when manufacturers will find it more profitable to\r\npurchase this most important raw material in China, than in Italy or the\r\nSouth of France. Acute business men in Hong-kong and Shanghai assured us\r\nthat it only needed an impulse from without to increase the silk\r\nmanufacture of China tenfold, and supply the annual demand for silk of the\r\nentire globe, which, if we are to believe encyclopedias and such like\r\nauthorities, amounts to from 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 lbs. What makes\r\nChinese silk especially suitable for the European market is its possessing\r\nin great perfection the two chief qualities of substance and colour,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, it is inferior to that of Europe in the fineness\r\nand glossy feel of its fibre. In Europe the silk is wound off from a\r\nlimited number of cocoons, whereas in China it is left to the discretion\r\nof the workman to spin it from few or many cocoons as he pleases. Hence\r\nresults that inequality and unevenness in the texture of the thread, a\r\ndefect which cannot possibly be remedied by after-manipulation, and which\r\naccordingly completely prevents its employment in the manufacture of the\r\nmore costly fabrics. This drawback, which is the main reason why Chinese\r\nsilk does not rule the European market, will however admit of being\r\nremedied without any difficulty, so soon as the silk districts become more\r\neasily accessible, by the introduction of European labour and machinery,\r\nwhen this valuable and costly product will gain materially both in\r\nfineness and suitability.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years since German and Austrian merchants attached but a small\r\nvalue to Chinese silk as suited to our market, and it seemed to them a\r\npositive absurdity, when any one spoke, as we ourselves repeatedly have\r\ndone from a profound conviction of its truth, of the future influence\r\nexercised over the silk markets of the world by the influence of this\r\nChinese raw material. Now-a-days we hear that there is scarcely one single\r\nsilk factory which can hold its ground, unless, in addition to French and\r\nItalian silk, it imports Chinese silk, while the demand for that material\r\nincreases from year to year, and has very probably not yet attained the\r\none-hundredth part of the development of which it is susceptible.\r\n\r\nTea (_Cha_[165]) ranks next to silk among the articles which have raised\r\nthe trade with China to such an importance. The cultivation of the tea\r\nplant is of far later date than that of the mulberry tree, and its leaves,\r\nalthough used by the Chinese as a curative from the third century of our\r\nera, only came into general use, as providing a universal drink, towards\r\nthe end of the sixth century.[166] Statesmen and poets sounded the\r\npraises of the new beverage, and while the one employed this excellent and\r\nbeneficial gift of nature to fill the treasury by the imposition of a tax,\r\nthe others chanted the praise of the plant in their hymns and songs, and\r\nthus, probably without intending it, contributed to increase the revenue\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\n\"Tea,\" writes one of the older Chinese authors, \"soothes the spirit,\r\nsoftens the heart, dispels languor, restores from fatigue, stimulates the\r\nintellect, and arouses from indolence; it makes the body lighter and more\r\nbrisk, and quickens the faculty of observation.\"\r\n\r\nThe tea plant first attracted the attention of Chinese naturalists in\r\nWu-yi, or, as the English term it, the Bohea[167] district, which enjoys\r\nto this day a great reputation for the exquisite quality which grows on\r\nits hills.\r\n\r\nAt present the cultivation of the tea plant extends northward as far as\r\nTang-tschao, in the province of Shantung, southward as far as Canton and\r\nKuang-si, and westward as far as the province of Yun-nan. As, moreover,\r\nthe tea plant likewise abounds in Japan, the Corea, and the Loo-Choo\r\nIslands, as also in Chusan, Tonquin, and Cochin China, we may assume that\r\nit flourishes over about 28 deg. of latitude and 30 deg. of longitude, within\r\nwhich it can be cultivated without being affected by severe alternations\r\nof temperature. That part of North China, however, which lies between 27 deg.\r\nand 33 deg. N., seems on the whole to furnish the finest sorts,[168] where the\r\nmean annual temperature ranges between 61 deg.7 and 68 deg., and in which fine\r\nweather with a rise of temperature follows upon a heavy rainfall; the\r\nlatter being as necessary for the speedy and luxuriant growth of the\r\nleaves, as the former is for eliciting their fragrance and other valuable\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nTo form an idea of the enormous amount of tea which is annually cultivated\r\nin China, it suffices to remark that, after deducting the immense quantity\r\nconsumed, there are more than 70,000,000 lbs. exported annually.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention to give a disquisition upon the cultivation and\r\npreparation of the tea, the drying (_poey_), roasting (_tschoo_),\r\nperfuming and colouring of the leaves, in short, the long tedious process\r\nto which this valuable article of commerce is subjected from its\r\ncollection on the fertile green slopes of the bush-covered hills of Bohea,\r\ntill its arrival at the port of shipment in a form suited for exportation.\r\nWe prefer here to confine our attention to a consideration of those\r\nexperiments which have recently been made in China with respect to tea\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThere are of the tea plant an almost endless variety of qualities, but\r\nonly two species, viz. _Thea viridis_ (green tea), and _Thea Bohea_,[169]\r\nand even these two have such few points of difference, that quite lately\r\nthey were described by Fortune as one and the same species. Thus, too, it\r\nhas been asserted in our own day that the green and black varieties of tea\r\nsold in Europe do not, as is universally supposed, belong to two different\r\nspecies of tea, but that the difference of colour, shape of leaf, flavour,\r\n&c., is exclusively due to varieties in the mode of preparing them for the\r\nmarket, and that the manufacturer is able to make from the leaves every\r\ndescription, black or green, which is required in commerce. Thus in the\r\ncelebrated tea district of Ning-tschan, where in former days black tea was\r\nexclusively grown, there is now procured green tea from the same species\r\nof plant, apparently because its cultivation pays better, while the\r\nquality remains in its olden repute.\r\n\r\nThe black tea, which constitutes four-fifths of the entire export to\r\nEngland, is grown of a particularly fine quality in the district of\r\nKien-ning-foo in the province of Fo-kien, and is known to commerce by a\r\nvariety of names, chiefly derived from the localities in which it is\r\ngrown, or those of their proprietors. On the other hand, the green sort\r\nselected for exportation is chiefly met with on the slopes of the chain\r\nof hills between Che-kiang and Ngan-hwui. Besides those descriptions\r\nactually prepared on the spot where they grow, there are also an immense\r\nvariety of teas manufactured in Canton from all sorts of black and green\r\ntea. The tea-growers of Canton are reputed to colour their green teas\r\nartificially, by sprinkling them with a mixture of Prussian blue and\r\npulverized chalk, after which they subject them to a rolling motion for a\r\nconsiderable time in heated copper pans.[170]\r\n\r\nOne most important element in tea cultivation is the method adopted to\r\nimpart a certain bloom, an artificial fragrance, which it does not possess\r\nin the natural state. This process of \"scenting,\" as it is called, which\r\nis practised exclusively for the foreign market, is termed by the Chinese\r\n_Hwa-hiang_. The flowers which are used for imparting this fragrance, and\r\nthe growth of which, like the invisible fields of odoriferous herbs near\r\nCannes, in the South of France, forms a most important branch of\r\ncultivation near Canton, are chiefly _Jasminum sambac_, _Jasminum\r\npaniculatum_, _Aglaia odorata_, _Olea fragrans_, _Sardenia florida_,\r\norange-blossom, and roses. The method of \"scenting\" consists simply in\r\nplacing a definite quantity of the flower-blossoms, varying according to\r\nthe strength or feebleness of the odour, in juxtaposition with about 100\r\nlbs. of dried tea-leaves, where they are suffered to remain from 24 to 48\r\nhours. Thus 40 lbs. of orange-blossom, 50 lbs. of Jasmin, 100 lbs. of\r\n_Aglaia odorata_, are reckoned the equivalent respectively of 100 lbs. of\r\ntea-leaves. The extraordinary costliness of these fragrant blossoms[171]\r\nhas caused a very general suspicion to prevail, that the leaves thus\r\n\"scented\" are afterwards adulterated with large quantities of the common\r\nteas. And as it is an ascertained fact that 60 lbs. of such tea can impart\r\na similar fragrance to 100 lbs. additional by merely mixing the two\r\ntogether, without any apparent diminution of fragrance, it seems more than\r\nprobable that similar admixtures, very possibly in a still more profitable\r\nproportion, are being silently carried on every day in the warehouses of\r\nthe tea districts.\r\n\r\nSince the suppression of the East India Company's monopoly, and the\r\nopening of the Five Ports, tea has somewhat fallen in price, but has in\r\nconsequence gained in far greater ratio in respect of quantity shipped.\r\nThe value of a picul of tea is at present about 18 or 20 taels (L5 12_s._\r\n6_d._ to L6 5_s._), so that the pound costs 1_s._ 1_d._ to 1_s._ 2_d._\r\nNotwithstanding the unexampled cheapness of hand labour (60 to 70 cash, or\r\n2-1/2_d._ to 3_d._, per diem), it is not possible to procure _good tea_\r\nbelow this limit, although the various descriptions vary extraordinarily\r\nin price according to their quality and the districts they come from. The\r\nlower classes in the tea districts purchase for themselves the raw\r\nunprepared leaves just as they are plucked, for about 1_d._ per pound,\r\nand as it takes about 4 lbs. of the fresh leaves to make 1 lb. of dry\r\nleaves, it may be calculated that the tea, as drunk by this class, must\r\ncost from 4_d._ to 5_d._ per lb. Moreover, it is customary to add some of\r\nthe less costly descriptions, more especially in districts at some little\r\ndistance where the tea plant is cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe first historical document referring to the introduction into England\r\nof tea as a beverage, is an Act of Parliament in the year 1660 (the year\r\nof the Restoration). At that period China tea cost sixty shillings the\r\npound, which of course limited its use to a very narrow circle. At present\r\nthere are 30,000,000 lbs. imported into England[172] annually, or more\r\nthan one half of the entire export from the Central Empire, the consumer\r\nin London paying about 3_s._ per pound on the average.\r\n\r\nOf late years attempts have been made to cultivate the tea plant at the\r\nfoot of the Himalayas, in Java, and in the United States. In Hindustan,\r\nwhither only a few years ago that well-known and enlightened gentleman,\r\nMr. Robert Fortune, dispatched 24,000 plants, selected from among the\r\nfinest tea districts, the experiment has already proved successful, and\r\neven remunerative. The cost of growing is about 10-1/2_d._ per lb. for\r\none description, which fetches 2_s._ per lb. in the London market. That\r\ngrown in Java has hitherto been viewed with disfavour in Europe, but in a\r\nfew years more it must make its way. The result of the experiments in the\r\nUnited States we have yet to learn. Mr. Fortune, who was intrusted by the\r\nPatent Office at Washington with superintending the introduction of the\r\ntea cultivation into the Southern States, and who in virtue of many years'\r\nscientific researches in China may be regarded as an authority upon this\r\nsubject, is of opinion that the possibility of cultivating tea in the\r\nUnited States does not admit of a doubt, since the plant not only\r\nsuccessfully resists frosts, but even, in a measure, benefits by them, it\r\nbeing a well-known fact that it flourishes better in the northern than the\r\nsouthern climates of China. It is questionable, however, whether its\r\ncultivation can prove remunerative in a country where labour is still so\r\nexceptionally high. Will the tea plant repay the immense cost of\r\ncultivation, and compete successfully with the product of China? The next\r\nfew years will settle this question, if it be not choked by this unholy\r\nfratricidal war, which is raging within the freest and most glorious\r\nconfederacy of modern times.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the good \"fortune\" while at Shanghai of becoming personally\r\nacquainted with Mr. Fortune, and of gathering these valuable particulars\r\nfrom the very lips of that distinguished naturalist and traveller. While\r\nreserving for consideration elsewhere the subject of various little known,\r\nbut most important, articles of export from the vast Empire of China, we\r\ncannot refrain from indulging in a few remarks upon some useful products\r\nof that country, which seem to us of more than merely commercial\r\nimportance. Among these we shall notice first one of the most valuable\r\nrewards bestowed by Nature on human industry, the so-called Chinese\r\nsugar-cane (_Sorghum_, or _Holcus saccharatus_), which deserves the\r\nearnest attention of all European proprietors of land, as it grows in its\r\nnative country quite in the northern districts, in fact in latitudes where\r\nthe ordinary cane (_Saccharum officinale_) no longer flourishes; because\r\nfrost and cold are much more conducive to its growth than the opposite\r\nextreme, so that it would seem to be specially adapted for cultivation in\r\nSouthern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to cultivate this cane in Europe was made, if we are\r\nrightly informed, at the Hyeres islands by Count David de Beauregard, from\r\nseeds which M. de Montigny had sent home to the Geographical Society of\r\nParis, while other attempts were made at the same time in various parts of\r\nFrance by the _Societe d' Acclimatisation_. The results surpassed the most\r\nsanguine expectations. From the stem there was obtained a juice from which\r\nsugar and alcohol, syrup and brandy, can be easily made. The abundant\r\nleaves, five or six feet long, furnished a considerable quantity of cattle\r\nwith most nutritive food; the seeds were used as food for poultry, and\r\nwere even substituted with advantage for barley in the provender supplied\r\nto horses, so that the experiment at once repaid its cost, while in\r\naddition to the foregoing, the flour obtained from the seeds was found to\r\nfurnish a highly nutritive, wholesome article of diet for man. Dr. Adrian\r\nSicard, to whom the agricultural world is indebted for a very exhaustive\r\nanalysis of the Chinese sugar-cane, has established, by conclusive\r\nresearches, that its leaves are also specially adapted for the manufacture\r\nof paper, as well as for various colours or dye stuffs. As to the\r\nremunerative value of the _Sorgho_, it is more than 230 per cent. more\r\nproductive than beet-root, which in France produces on the average 2160\r\nkilogrammes per hectare, while the _Sorgho_ makes a return of 5000\r\nkilogrammes.\r\n\r\nThe mode of cultivating this useful plant differs in no respect, as we\r\nrepeatedly had occasion to observe, from that of maize or Indian corn. The\r\nseason for sowing varies with the temperature of the country, between the\r\nmonths April and July. The seed when sown in the beginning of April will\r\nbe ripe about the middle of August, or in 135 days, while that sown in\r\nmid-July will not be ripe before the end of November, or about 140 days.\r\nIn France the experiment has been made of bathing the seeds in tepid water\r\nfor periods varying from 24 to 48 hours before sowing, which resulted in a\r\nmuch more speedy bringing forward of the plant. In like manner experiments\r\nwere made of sowing the seeds with and without their husk, the result of\r\nwhich was that the former took 15 days, and the latter only 10 days to\r\nsprout. It is recommended to plant the seeds in furrows sufficiently\r\nseparated from each other according to the conditions of soil and\r\nirrigation, so far as is possible.\r\n\r\nThe period of germination of the _Sorgho_ is rather long, but once that\r\nperiod is passed, the most favourable results are sure to follow, even\r\nshould the most unusual alternations of temperature ensue, provided the\r\nthermometer does not descend below 27 deg.5 Fahr. The _Sorgho_ requires about\r\nfive months to attain its full ripeness, when it is usually of a\r\npale-yellow colour, streaked with red. It is occasionally subject to\r\ndifferent maladies, some of which attack the root, others the pith. In\r\nlike manner the larvae of certain noxious insects have been remarked on\r\noccasional specimens. But the origin of all these drawbacks has been as\r\nyet far too little inquired into, and they are of too rare occurrence to\r\npermit of any definite information respecting them being as yet available.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the cultivation of the _Sorgho_ may be regarded as eminently\r\nsuccessful in the South of France, as well as in Pennsylvania, U. S.\r\n(which has a much severer climate than Venetia, Dalmatia, or the lower\r\ncourse of the Danube). Very probably we may also succeed in naturalizing\r\nthe _Sorgho_ in suitable parts of Austria, and introducing there the\r\ncultivation on a commensurate scale[173] of a plant, which bids fair not\r\nmerely to prove far more profitable in cultivation than any other member\r\nof the vegetable kingdom in any part of the earth, but at the same time\r\nseems destined at no distant period to be the means of supplying the\r\ncivilized world with one of its most vitally necessary articles of food,\r\nby means of free white labour, without the assistance of slavery![174]\r\n\r\nAnother plant, which it seems likely might be advantageously introduced\r\ninto the southern districts of Europe, is the _Mo-chok_, one of the most\r\ngraceful kinds of bamboo found in the forests of China, which grows in\r\ngreatest luxuriance on the limestone slopes of the province of\r\nTschi-Kiang, in a climate ranging between 90 deg.5 in summer, and 20 deg.3\r\n(Fahr.) in winter. The erect, smooth, elegant stem shoots up to a height\r\nof from 60 to 80 feet. The lower part of the tree is usually free from\r\nbranches, which usually begin to spring from the trunk about 20 feet from\r\nthe ground, and are very delicately leaved. These and two other species,\r\nthe _Long-sin-chok_ and the _Hu-chok_, are used in the manufacture of\r\nsieves, baskets, furniture, &c., while the tender shoots form a most\r\nnutritious and delicately flavoured vegetable. The stem of the plant is\r\nmoreover available for the manufacture of paper.[175]\r\n\r\nWriting paper is manufactured from it as well as packing paper, and one\r\nvery coarse quality is mingled with the mortar by the Chinese masons. Mr.\r\nFortune has introduced the Mo-chok into China, where, especially in the\r\nnorth-west provinces, it promises to come on well upon the slopes of the\r\nHimalaya.\r\n\r\nOf the other plants which grow in China, which are not indeed suited for\r\ntransplanting to a colder climate, yet merit attention on account of\r\ntheir produce, we shall briefly notice the varnish tree, the tallow tree,\r\nand the wax shrub.\r\n\r\nThe varnish tree (_Vernix vernicia_), a sort of sumach, which grows in\r\ngreatest luxuriance in the provinces of Kiang-si, Chi-kiang, and Szechuen,\r\nfurnishes that varnish which, partly in a semi-fluid, partly in a dry\r\nstate, comes to market in whitish cakes, and is worth, according to\r\nquality and demand, from 40 to 100 dollars per picul of 133 lbs. In the\r\npreparation of this lacquer, the reputation of which has extended over the\r\nglobe, 6-2/3 lbs. varnish, 13-1/2 lbs. water, 41-2/3 lbs. nut-oil, 16-2/3\r\nlbs. of pigs' gall, and 33-1/3 lbs. of vinegar, are mixed together till\r\nthe whole assumes the consistence and appearance of a shining black paste.\r\nThe fact that many Chinese lacquered wares, especially those prepared in\r\nFoo-chow, vie with the renowned manufactures of Japan in beauty and\r\nlustre, leaves room to suspect that the Chinese workmen have received some\r\ninstruction from their Japanese fellow-craftsmen.\r\n\r\nVegetable tallow (_Schulah_, or _Schu-kau_, tree fat) is obtained from the\r\n_Stillingia sebifera_, the so-called tallow tree, and, judging by the\r\nexperiments made with it, promises under an extended system of cultivation\r\nto become a tolerably profitable article of export. The tallow tree\r\nflourishes throughout the southern provinces, but is chiefly found in the\r\nisland of Chusan and the coasts adjacent. The tallowy substance procured\r\nfrom the seeds, which externally resemble nuts, is sold in cakes of from\r\n90 to 130 lbs. at from 7 to 12 dollars.\r\n\r\nVegetable or tree wax (_peh-lah_) is a waxy substance, which the _coccus\r\npela_ or _flata limitata_ deposits, apparently as a protection to its\r\neggs, on a sort of ash tree, on whose twigs and boughs it is deposited\r\nlike snow-flakes. It is gathered after the first frost, and purified by\r\nmelting it in a cloth held over hot water. Apparently the process is\r\nvaried by dipping what has been collected in a silken sack into hot water.\r\nIt melts at 81 deg. Fahr., and in consequence of its unusual stiffness is much\r\nused for admixture with bees-wax and other descriptions of fats used in\r\nthe manufacture of tapers. The candles hitherto made in England of this\r\nsubstance have commanded a large sale, and only the circumstance that as\r\nyet but a small quantity has found its way into commerce, prevents its\r\nbeing much more extensively cultivated. The price of _Peh-lah_ is rather\r\nhigh, as it fetches about L11 10_s._ per 133 lbs.\r\n\r\nPassing from the various natural products furnished for export by China to\r\na consideration of those articles[176] of European industry, for which the\r\nChinese market supplies an ample demand, we find that their number is\r\nconsiderable, while they represent a value of upwards of L5,000,000. In\r\nthese pages, however, we propose to notice only that article which is the\r\nmost profitable, and undoubtedly forms the chief staple of import in all\r\nthe harbours opened to foreign commerce, viz. opium. Opium (_a-pien_), the\r\nsolidified sap of _Papaver somniferum_, was, as every one knows, up to\r\nquite a recent period, a monopoly of the Anglo-Indian Government, by whom\r\nit was cultivated under the superintendence of agents in the various\r\nprovinces of Hindostan, and sold to the trade by public auction in large\r\nquantities at a time in the markets of Calcutta and Bombay. It seems to\r\nfulfil among the Chinese the function of the various spirituous liquors of\r\nEurope; at least every attempt to introduce among the Chinese a taste for\r\nale, whisky, sherry, port, champagne, and claret, has hitherto entirely\r\nfailed. Indeed there is probably no country of the globe where, in\r\nproportion to population, there is so little spirituous liquor introduced\r\nas into China, what is imported being almost exclusively for the\r\nconsumption of foreigners. The Chinese is emphatically a born\r\n\"tea-totaller,\" or friend of abstemiousness, for the native drinks,\r\nsubstitutes for wine, which are obtained chiefly from rice and millet, are\r\nonly used on special occasions, and then only in small quantities. During\r\nour entire stay in Chinese waters, we never saw one single Chinese drunk,\r\nand heard in every quarter that any such cases are rare and quite\r\nexceptional. On the other hand, the consumption of opium is continually\r\nincreasing, and the quantity of solidified poppy-juice annually imported\r\namounts to from 75,000 to 80,000 chests, which at current rates represent\r\na value of from L7,500,000 to L10,000,000. There are four descriptions of\r\nopium that come to the Chinese market, viz. Benares (_Ku-ni_), Patna\r\n(_Kung-ni_), Malwa (_Peh-pi_), and Turkish (_Kiu-ni_ or golden dung). Of\r\nthese the Patna and Benares are reckoned of finer quality, and\r\nconsequently are more sought after, than that imported from Malwa, but\r\nboth descriptions are preferred by the Chinese to the Turkish, and even to\r\nthat produced at home.[177]\r\n\r\nThe custom of opium-smoking is of comparatively modern introduction among\r\nthe Chinese. It was about the commencement of the 18th century,[178] that\r\nthe practice of mingling opium with tobacco as an antidote against\r\ntoothache, headache, and pains in the body first began to prevail. Chinese\r\nsailors and merchantmen, returning from the islands of the Bornese\r\nArchipelago, had learned from the natives to inhale it as an anaesthetic,\r\nwhich, depriving them of all activity, brought the most delightful visions\r\nbefore their eyes. It is unquestionably the prohibition of wine to the\r\nbelievers in the Koran which first directed their attention to this\r\nnarcotic substance, which the Western Asiatics swallow in pills, the\r\nHindoos chew, and the Chinese smoke. In 1750, there were imported into\r\nChina from Turkey, Persia, and Bengal, chiefly by Portuguese merchants,\r\nsome 200 to 250 chests according to official return (of 140 lbs. each),\r\nostensibly for medical use. Nothing could be more welcome to the entire\r\nEmpire than a means of passing the intervals of relaxation from the hurry\r\nof business, in a state of absolute exemption from all anxiety, rocked in\r\nthe most delightful slumbers! In 1773 the East India Company sent a small\r\nportion of opium to China by way of speculation. Seven years later they\r\nfounded an Opium Depot in Larke's Bay. In 1781 the Company sent 2800\r\nchests (of 140 lbs. each) at one single shipment to Canton, where it was\r\npurchased by a \"Hong,\" or Association,[179] for trading purposes. The\r\nCompany found itself compelled, however, to re-export a quantity, as at\r\nthat period there was not in China a sufficient demand for such a supply.\r\nThe first regular shipments began in 1798, when 4170 chests were sent to\r\nthe account of the Association in China, and then sold at Rs. 415 (about\r\nL41 10_s._) per chest.[180] Since that period the import and consumption\r\nhave been steadily increasing at a geometric ratio, and a table now before\r\nus, drawn up with great labour and industry by Dr. Medhurst, informs us\r\nthat between 1798 and 1855 there were imported altogether 1,197,041 chests\r\nof opium from Bengal, which, after deducting all expenses of cultivation\r\nand shipment, represented a net gain to the East India Company of\r\nL67,851,853.[181]\r\n\r\nRelying on the splendid profits secured to the East India Company, and its\r\ncolleagues settled in China, by the opium traffic, no one troubled himself\r\nin the slightest with the many protests of the Chinese Government, any\r\nmore than the anathemas launched at opium dealers and opium-smokers by\r\nEnglish missionaries and philanthropists. The dealers, growing richer day\r\nby day, contented themselves with laconic replies to the more virulent of\r\ntheir antagonists, to the effect that they were but supplying a want\r\noriginating in a national custom, and that it was as futile to attempt to\r\nprevent the Chinese from smoking as to restrain Europeans from the use of\r\nspirituous liquors. Both when abused are productive of much evil, and even\r\nthen opium was productive of far less destructive ravages on the human\r\norganism, and was never followed by such appalling catastrophes as those\r\nresulting from alcohol. The dark side of the opium traffic has since been\r\nso fully exposed, that but little more remains to be said, and although\r\neven the most sanguine persons have ceased to hope that the trade can\r\never be entirely suppressed, yet it is at least consolatory to know that,\r\naccording to the best calculations, the number of opium smokers throughout\r\nChina, in a population that is to say of 420,000,000, is not above\r\n4,000,000 to 5,000,000, and that an ordinary smoker does not on an average\r\nconsume more than one mace or about one drachm[182] of opium, worth about\r\n90 cash, or 3-1/2_d._ The provisions of the new tariff, by which opium may\r\nbe imported unrestrictedly on payment of a fixed duty of 30 taels (about\r\nL10) per chest when water-borne, and 20 taels (about L6 10_s._) when\r\nimported by land, must materially effect the opium trade as hitherto\r\ncarried on, and may very possibly alter the views at present entertained\r\nby the Chinese Government with reference to this important article of\r\ncommerce, in proportion as its treasury begins to be replenished by such a\r\nhigh rate of duty.\r\n\r\nAlthough for European readers the chief interest of China is to be found\r\nin its relations with foreign countries, we yet cannot take leave of it\r\nwithout a few remarks on the momentous political movement which has been\r\non foot since 1849 in several provinces of China, and claims, in\r\nconsequence of its peculiar religious nature, universal interest.\r\n\r\nHung-sin-Tsuen, the originator and head of this rebellion, was born in\r\n1813, in a village near Canton, and while yet in his early youth was, in\r\nconsequence of his precocity, removed from tending his father's flocks to\r\nbe a scholar in the village, where he pursued his studies with such zeal,\r\nthat a year later he took several degrees as a teacher. On one of his\r\nvisits to Canton, he made the acquaintance of a Protestant missionary,\r\nwith whom he long corresponded, and from whom he received a variety of\r\ntracts translated into Chinese, and books, by way of presents. In the\r\ncourse of a serious illness with which he was assailed about this period,\r\nhe had numerous visions, and is said in his delirium to have insisted on\r\nbeing hailed Emperor of China. Gradually Hung and his friend and zealous\r\nadherent Fung-Yun-San became, through erroneous or wilful\r\nmisinterpretation of the works of various missionary societies, the\r\nfounders of a new creed, a sort of free, semi-Christian sect, which, as it\r\ncould not long subsist without coming into collision with the reigning\r\nGovernment, very speedily assumed a political character. It is an\r\nindubitable fact that at first the religious movement was supported by the\r\nProtestant missionaries, and the views of its founders forwarded by every\r\nmeans in their power, with the object of using it to prepare the soil for\r\nthe promulgation of Christianity. When about entering his forty-first\r\nyear, Hung formed an alliance with American missionaries stationed at\r\nCanton, studied their books, after which he returned to the province of\r\nKuang-si, where he published writings descriptive of the alleged\r\nmanifestations of the Deity, gave himself forth as a poet,[183] and at\r\nthe same time issued proclamations under the designation of the \"Heavenly\r\nKing.\" The severity with which the regular Government treated the\r\ninsurgents, and all who consorted with them, only served to augment their\r\nranks, to which the mysticism of their doctrine contributed in no small\r\ndegree; for the credulous masses have in all lands the same love of the\r\nmarvellous and unintelligible. Such a result only increased the courage,\r\nthe energy, the arrogance of Hung. He no longer was content to announce\r\nhimself as \"the mouth through which God the Father, and Jesus the Elder\r\nBrother, declared their will;\" he now proclaimed boldly the intention of\r\nhimself and his followers to overthrow the unworthy Mantchoo dynasty, and\r\nraise to the throne a new native dynasty, that of the Tai-ping, or\r\nuniversal peace. Although stigmatized by the official _Pekin Gazette_ as\r\n\"local banditti,\" they were nevertheless strong enough in March, 1852, to\r\nstorm even such a populous city as Nankin, where they set up a\r\nprovisional government, and have since fortified it as their\r\nhead-quarters. At the time the Tai-ping rebellion first broke out, Yeh,\r\nthe then Governor of Canton, thought he would readily be able to suppress\r\nit by the summary process of chopping off the heads of all who were\r\nsupposed to be in correspondence with them, and thus had as many as 800\r\nexecuted daily.[184] It was no longer quite safe for a native to show\r\nhimself in the streets of Canton, unless provided with a paper of\r\nidentification. For this purpose, four-cornered pieces of a sort of white\r\ncotton fabric were worn, on which was printed a sign in red. These cotton\r\nstrips served as countersigns for those friendly to the reigning dynasty,\r\nand were worn concealed from view, but so as to admit of being at once\r\nshown in case of need. Dr. Pfitzmaier, who has examined this sign, is of\r\nopinion that it is simply a union of the three signs [Chinese\r\ncharacter(s)] which, so far as the two last are concerned, seem to have\r\nbeen compressed together and abbreviated, so that only the initiated could\r\nunderstand its significance. The learned sinologue is of opinion that this\r\nhieroglyphic, signifying \"to offer hand and heart,\" or \"to offer the\r\noriginal (own) heart,\" has nevertheless no meaning apart from the centre\r\nfigure, which, however, is unusually distorted, so that the whole may\r\nalso mean [Chinese character(s)] Kia-hoei, \"to yield grace and\r\nbenevolence,\" or may be applicable to him who wears it, \"one who enjoys\r\nthe all-embracing Imperial clemency.\"\r\n\r\nThe religious direction of the Tai-ping movement, coupled with its\r\napparent Christian tendencies, its results, and, above all, the last\r\nhostile proclamation of the Pekin Government against foreigners, roused\r\nthe sympathies of both Europeans and Americans in favour of the\r\ninsurgents; and in the English papers of Hong-kong and Shanghai, the\r\npolicy was vigorously and repeatedly advocated of turning the insurrection\r\nto their own advantage; while in a religious point of view it was\r\nrecommended to avail themselves of the favour shown to the Scriptures by\r\nthe Christian sect of the Tai-ping, which was also so amicably disposed to\r\nforeigners, who at all events were more likely to prove a bulwark and\r\nsupport to English Protestantism than the deceitful, promise-breaking,\r\nidol-worshipping Mantchoos. Letters and communications, which from time to\r\ntime were published on the visit of Protestant missionaries in the\r\ninsurgent camp, were apt to propound the most favourable ideas about the\r\ninsurgents and their strivings after religious truth, and to attach to\r\ntheir victories and successes the most glorious hopes with respect to the\r\nspreading of Christianity in China. Fortunately the English Government did\r\nnot suffer its policy to be affected thereby, but continued to observe the\r\nstrictest neutrality. Only in those cases where, owing to the advance of\r\nthe rebels, the interests of British subjects or of universal commerce\r\nseemed to be endangered, communications were held with the \"Heavenly King\"\r\nor his ministers, or to protest against the injury and limitation of trade\r\nwith the earnestness and depth of impression which Armstrong guns are apt\r\nto impart to diplomatic dispatches. Thus the insurgents were prohibited\r\nfrom approaching within 10 Li of the city of Hang-kow, by this measure\r\nprotecting not alone their own property, but the entire city from pillage\r\nand destruction. During the last war the interests of the insurgents were\r\nkept entirely in the background, and during the stay of the _Novara_ at\r\nShanghai, which had likewise been repeatedly threatened by the insurgents,\r\nwe could gain but little enlightenment as to the nature and direction of\r\nthe movement.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the Treaty of Pekin has thrown open the navigation of the\r\nmost important rivers, and thus facilitated communication with the\r\ninterior, there has been a better opportunity than hitherto for\r\nintercourse with the Tai-ping, as also for obtaining a clearer insight\r\ninto its present condition, as well as the object and inevitable\r\nconsequences of their tenets. People are beginning to consider it more\r\ncalmly, and even the missionaries seem gradually abandoning the\r\nexpectations they had formed, of finding in it a means of helping the\r\ncause of Christianity, albeit a former missionary, Rev. J. C. Roberts, who\r\nin 1847 had spent several months with Hung, is at the present moment a\r\nsort of minister of foreign affairs in the insurgents' camp at Nankin. The\r\nlatest information respecting the Tai-ping enters so fully into the\r\ncharacter of the whole movement, and so clearly develops its tendency,\r\nthat no apology is needed for laying before the readers of every class a\r\nbrief sketch of the more important and significant dogmas.\r\n\r\nThe Tai-ping translations of the Old and New Testament, though in the\r\nwhole tolerably correct, yet are in certain parts so imperfect that they\r\nimplanted the most erroneous ideas in the head of the \"Celestial King.\" He\r\nconceived his own visions and revelations as far more important, and of\r\nfar higher authority, than those of Holy Writ. His mission, as he himself\r\nstates it, is to be followed by a new revelation, accompanied by numerous\r\nmiracles, and a third book will be given to the world, which is to\r\nsupersede the Old and New Testaments, and be called the \"_True_\r\nTestament.\" According to Hung, both God and Christ have appeared in the\r\nhuman form. Christ is not equal to the Father, that is solely God; he is\r\nalso brought into connection with other redeemers, and has a wife and\r\nchildren in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Celestial King and his son form with God and Christ a Quaternity in\r\nUnity. The corporeal presence of the Celestial King is that of the\r\nGodhead, and in the distempered imagination of the Tai-ping the government\r\nnow existing in Nankin is assuredly that of heaven itself!\r\n\r\nThe Tai-ping suffer no one to preach against their creed, because that\r\nwould be to diminish the authority of their chief, and damp the ardour of\r\ntheir hopes. In their various proclamations it is expressly declared that\r\nHung-sin-Tsuen is the brother of the Saviour, the Son of God, without any\r\nother distinction than such as must exist between an elder and a younger\r\nbrother. They maintain that there is a celestial mother as well as Father,\r\na heavenly sister as well as a heavenly Brother, and that the recently\r\ndefunct King of the West, Fung-yun-san, one of Hung's oldest adherents, is\r\nnow married to the heavenly sister. They hold to the opinion that not one\r\nof such of their revelations as clash with the Old and New Testaments, can\r\nbe decided by such ancient books of religion. Their revelations being the\r\nnewest, are on that account the most entitled to belief.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of greeting addressed by Hung to Roberts[185] the missionary,\r\non the occasion of the arrival of the latter at Nankin, in October, 1860,\r\nHung narrates his heavenly journey in 1837, the repeated miraculous\r\ninterference of the Father and the Son in his favour, as also the\r\nrevelations made to the Eastern King. He professes to have seen the Father\r\nand Christ, the heavenly mother and the heavenly sister. He is himself\r\n\"the Way, the Truth, and the Life,\" just as Christ is. He warns Roberts\r\nrepeatedly, that implicit belief in this is of the highest importance, as\r\notherwise he can neither be useful in this world nor blest in the next.\r\nAfter such an exposition, Christian missionaries will scarcely be suffered\r\nin the insurgent's camp if they dare to preach against such errors, not to\r\nsay blasphemies.\r\n\r\nThere are but few religious ceremonies. The Tai-ping, indeed, call one\r\nday of the week the day of prayer, and it happens more through oversight\r\nthan intention to be fixed upon the Saturday, but so far as external\r\nsanctity goes there seems to be no special attention paid to it. They buy,\r\nand sell, and delve just as on other days. On the previous night about ten\r\no'clock two or three cannon-shot are fired to announce the approach of the\r\nhour of prayer, and that the day of worship is at hand. Every family is\r\nengaged for an hour in devotion and praise. All strangers who have been in\r\ncommunication with the Tai-ping in Nankin state that, even in the capital\r\nwhere he has been resident for seven years past, that dignitary does not\r\nobserve the Sabbath in any way, either by preaching, prayer, or expounding\r\nof the Scripture; there are no exhortations or pious admonitions; they\r\nhave neither church nor temple; their sole divine service consists in each\r\none reciting in his own house English hymns, and repeating a few prayers,\r\nwhile divers offerings are made, such as tea, rice, and the flesh of slain\r\nanimals. They offer their prayers kneeling, after which they close the\r\nproceedings by singing a hymn standing. An English missionary, who arrived\r\nat Nankin with the conviction that the insurgents were genuine sincere\r\nChristians, made, after a short stay, the following severe but just remark\r\nconcerning them: \"I found to my regret no trace of Christianity, but a\r\nsystem of the grossest idolatry substituted for it, and arrogating its\r\nname. Their notion of God is so distorted, that it is, if possible, still\r\nmore erroneous than that entertained of the Supreme Being by other\r\nidol-worshipping Chinese. Their conception of the Redeemer, to whom they\r\npay equal honours, is crude, and thoroughly material. Their prayers, far\r\nfrom giving the impression of a true reverence of God, have much more the\r\nappearance of an idolatrous mockery of sacred things!\"\r\n\r\nAn English merchant, who accompanied Sir Hope Grant on his reconnoitring\r\nexcursion up the Yang-tse-Kiang, and spent a week in what used to be\r\ncalled Nankin, now the celestial capital of the Tai-ping, gives the\r\nfollowing characteristic sketch of them: \"The insurgents take no interest\r\nin and do not encourage trade, except in muskets and ammunition. To our\r\nrepresentations how unwise it was to lay waste towns and villages, and\r\nshut out commerce, they promised, after peace was concluded, to erect\r\nschools and other similar institutions, and professed their willingness to\r\npromote trade, but 'for the present,' they went on, 'we must, before\r\nanything else, make the hills and the rivers subject to our power.' On the\r\nwhole I found the condition of the rebels far better than I had expected.\r\nThey are comfortably clothed and well fed. The population of Nankin\r\nconsists exclusively of officials. No one not connected with the\r\nadministration of the army is admitted within the gates of the city. The\r\nmajority of the inhabitants, who number about 20,000, are prisoners and\r\nslaves from every part of the empire. Although employed in most arduous\r\nwork, they get no pay, but are simply clothed and fed. I remarked an\r\nextraordinary number of beautiful young women in elegant silken stuffs\r\nfrom Sutschan. There were also prisoners of war from Sutschan and other\r\nplaces, who, however, were by no means inclined to lead a very Christian\r\nand moral life in the celestial capital. The city of Nankin, as well as\r\nits suburb, the beautiful ancient cemetery of the Ning dynasty, and the\r\nfar-famed porcelain Pagoda, are all utterly destroyed; instead of the\r\nbroad well-paved streets of former times the stranger has now to pick his\r\nsteps through heaps of bricks and rubbish. The palaces of the kings of the\r\nTai-ping dynasty are glaringly conspicuous among all these ruins. They\r\nmust have been entirely rebuilt, for the old Yamuns and temples, like the\r\nwhole of the Tau-Tai City, have been demolished utterly.\r\n\r\n\"The rebel chief inhabits a large palace. His household consists of 300\r\nfemale attendants. He also, in virtue of his rank, has 68 wives supported\r\nfor him. No one but the kings (of whom there are 11 or 12, but only two\r\nare resident in Nankin) is permitted to approach his sacred person.\r\nProbably Hung is little more than a mere puppet in the hands of his\r\nministers. It is he who mainly keeps the rebellion on foot. Discipline is\r\nfar better maintained among the long-haired insurgents than the imperial\r\ntroops, and many of the younger soldiers have pleasing manners.\r\n\r\n\"The kings or Wangs, on the other hand, seem exceedingly lazy and\r\nvicious, and when they make their appearance, with a theatrical attempt at\r\nassuming a dignified deportment, clad in the yellow costume of a\r\nmountebank, and with a tinsel crown upon their heads, they present a most\r\nludicrous aspect. Not one of these so-called kings understands the\r\nMandarin dialect, so widely diffused among the educated classes;--not one,\r\nexcept Hung himself and Kan-wang, has a better education than one of his\r\ncoolies.[186] They have linguists at their elbow, who do their reading and\r\nwriting for them.\r\n\r\n\"The arms of the Tai-ping are very wretched, and the bare fact that they\r\nare able to make head against the Imperial troops, speak volumes for the\r\nutter helplessness and incapacity of the Imperial Government. I have not\r\nthe slightest expectation that any advantage will accrue to civilization\r\nor Christianity from the religio-political movement of the Tai-ping. No\r\nChinese will have anything to do with them. Their whole activity consists\r\nin burning, murdering, and devastating. They are universally detested by\r\nthe people; even those inhabitants of the city who do not belong to the\r\n'Brotherhood' detest them. For eight years their head-quarters have been\r\nat Nankin, which they destroyed, nor have they as yet made the slightest\r\nattempt to rebuild it. Trade and industry are forbidden. Their taxes are\r\nthree times higher than those of the regular Government. They take no\r\nmeasures to staunch the wounds which they have inflicted on the people,\r\nnor do they occupy it as though they had any permanent interest in the\r\nland. They take no pains to tap those slow but sure springs of revenue, or\r\nto increase the resources of the state. They lay themselves out to\r\nmaintain themselves by plunder. Nothing in their organization gives hope\r\nfor any amelioration of the present or consolidation of power in the\r\nfuture; there is nothing in the entire history of the Tai-ping to enlist\r\nsympathy or compel confidence in a movement which, under the mask of\r\nreligious reform, conceals the most hateful self-interest and terrorism,\r\nand under the pretext of spreading peace amongst men, brandishes the\r\nscourge of destruction and desolation among the provinces through which it\r\nhas passed.\"[187]\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of August the _Novara_ quitted her anchorage off Shanghai, and\r\nwith the steam-tug _Meteor_[188] fastened to her side availed herself of a\r\nspring-tide to make her way into the Yang-tse-Kiang. Off Wusung we awaited\r\nthe arrival of the post, after receiving which we were on 14th August\r\ntowed as far as Gutzlaff's Island. Here we had once more to lay to, owing\r\nto calms and currents, till at last on the 15th August a fresh breeze\r\nsprang up from the S.E., and enabled us to make an offing.\r\n\r\nThe temperature had materially altered during the last few days. After a\r\ncycle of oppressive heat the weather had suddenly changed to severe\r\nsqualls, with a marked fall in the barometric column. The thermometer,\r\nwhich while we were lying off Shanghai marked from 86 deg. to 93 deg.2 Fahr., now\r\nindicated in the morning only 68 deg. Fahr., and during the day never rose\r\nabove 77 deg. Fahr. The number of fever cases, which had reached the number of\r\nseventy, began gradually to fall off. Several cases of dysentery forthwith\r\nbegan to show symptoms of amendment.\r\n\r\nConsidering the latitude we were in, and the season of the year, the\r\nbarometer stood unusually high (30 deg.100), and although this might be\r\nattributable to the constant prevalence of easterly winds, we nevertheless\r\nknew we were approaching the period when the monsoon changes, and little\r\nreliance was to be placed on the steadiness of that from the S.E.\r\nAccordingly on the 17th the wind shifted round to N.E. by E., while our\r\ncourse was due S.E. This however rendered it necessary to tack, if we\r\nwished to pass to the northward of the Loo-Choo group, whereas we could\r\nrun free and with a fair wind through the southern channel. The sun set\r\nbehind a bank of dense clouds on the horizon. The western sky was tinged a\r\ndeep red, and the stars shone out with uncommon brilliancy, but with a\r\nsort of trembling ray. The barometer fell slowly but steadily; the sea\r\nbegan to heave perceptibly. Our course was now changed to S.E. by S.\r\n\r\nThe following morning the breeze freshened, and drew somewhat further aft;\r\nthe sky was covered with clouds massed together, those to the N.E. of a\r\nvery dark, almost black, colour. Wind and sea were now rising, the sky\r\nbecame more and more obscure, the barometer kept falling--there was every\r\nindication of the approach of heavy weather.\r\n\r\nThe 18th August, the birthday of our Emperor, was duly celebrated far on\r\nthe open ocean, in the middle of the China Sea. All was prepared for\r\nDivine worship, which was to be celebrated at 10 A.M. on the gun-deck, in\r\npresence of the staff and the entire crew. The Commodore had invited\r\nseveral gentlemen of the staff to dinner. On land no one thinks of\r\nconsulting the elements, when such a festival is to be observed, nor do\r\nthe guests waste many thoughts on wind, rain, and heavy seas, as they\r\nassemble in their comfortable chambers. At sea, on the other hand, the\r\nconditions are altered. Wind and weather are the masters here, whose\r\nbehests the sea-farer must attend to. This was our case on this 18th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nFirst, Divine service had to be dispensed with, because the sea became too\r\nheavy, rendering it necessary to close the port-holes in the gun-deck,\r\nwhere, as already mentioned, the service was to be performed. As the hour\r\nfor the festival drew nigh, the elements gave unmistakeable evidence of\r\ntheir determined hostility; there was no room any longer to doubt that we\r\nwere about to do battle with a regular Typhoon.[189] This species of\r\nstorm, which is very customary at the change of the monsoons in August,\r\nSeptember, and October, when the N.E. trade suddenly veers round and\r\nbecomes the S.W. monsoon, is, like the tornado of the West Indies, the\r\nPampero of the eastern coast of South America, and the hurricane of the\r\nMauritius, a whirlwind of the most colossal proportions and most\r\ntremendous fury, by which the atmosphere is swept in a circle at an\r\nastonishing velocity around a central point more or less calm, which does\r\nnot, however, remain stationary, but is continually progressing, and hence\r\nthey are usually termed _cyclones_, or circular storms, to distinguish\r\nthem from those other storms in which the wind moves in a straight line.\r\nIt has been reserved for scientific investigation to explain the\r\nextraordinary regularity of the laws in obedience to which the masses of\r\nair, in the case of such storms occurring in the Southern hemisphere, move\r\nin the direction of the hands of a clock, whereas in the Northern\r\nhemisphere they are rotated in an opposite direction. In like manner, the\r\ndirection of the centre round which the _cyclone_ is raging has been\r\ndefinitely ascertained, so that, provided with these data, it is not\r\nmerely possible for the navigator to hold aloof from the dangerous\r\ncentral point of these circular storms, where the best and stoutest ship\r\nthat ever floated must almost to a certainty be swallowed up, but even to\r\navail himself of the wind to reach the edge of the _cyclone_ (the breadth\r\nof whose path is from 300 to 1000 miles), and thus make a rapid and\r\nprosperous passage. By mid-day the wind had increased to such an extent\r\nthat we had to take in most of our sails, and reef the rest. The sea now\r\nrose, and many of its waves came thundering upon our decks. The vessel was\r\ntossed to and fro with such violence that everything which had not been\r\nmade fast, or was attached to the vessel, began to lurch from side to\r\nside. Nevertheless, the invited guests sat down to table, made the seats\r\nand the table fast, and, such at least whom the violent rocking did not\r\nmake sea-sick, partook of a pleasant and joyous meal. But even these\r\nprecautions did not prevent numerous unpleasant accidents. One tremendous\r\nlurch of the ship, which took us unawares, suddenly set adrift a number of\r\nour mess, who rolled over and over each other upon that unstable floor,\r\namid a hideous chaos of tumblers, bottles, plates, and crockery. Chairs\r\nand _fauteuils_ had their legs broken, everything breakable went into\r\nirretrievable smash, the convives escaping serious injury only by a\r\nmarvel. Once more they took their seats at table, where only the bare\r\ncloth gave promise of security, and endeavoured to anchor themselves more\r\nfirmly. When, at the conclusion of the meal, our Commodore gave the usual\r\ntoast, and his guests emptied their glasses to the health of the reigning\r\nmonarch, the band attempted to strike up the National Anthem, and a hearty\r\ncheer resounded above the groaning of the ship, the howling of the wind,\r\nand the sullen roar of the ever-increasing waves, as they lashed against\r\nthe ship's sides.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down behind clouds, as we went careering along under\r\nclose-reefed main sail and storm stay-sail over a confused sea, running\r\nmountains high, and with huge heavy grey masses of cloud and mist close\r\noverhead; the barometer was still falling, and as night closed in the wind\r\nsung mournfully, yet with almost deafening noise, through the masts and\r\nrigging. The wind now shifted and sprung up from N.E. by N., which being\r\nan additional sign that the centre of the _cyclone_ was receding, we felt\r\nassured that we were on the right side to keep clear of it. By midnight\r\nthe wind came still further round, till it stood steadily at N.E., when it\r\nacquired fresh strength, and blew a most violent hurricane. The centre of\r\nthe _cyclone_ had once more altered its course, and begun to move in our\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOur position at noon (27 deg. 25' N. and 125 deg. 23' E.) was the most\r\nunfavourable possible. We had a N.E. wind, and were in the N.E. section of\r\nthe typhoon, whose centre, as is customary in these storms, was moving in\r\na N.W. or W. direction, and therefore threatened the more readily to\r\novertake us, that our course lay S.E. through the wide channel, which\r\nleads from the Chinese Sea into the open ocean between the Loo-Choo\r\nIslands and the Meiaco-sima group. There was now no other egress possible\r\nthan by steering W. by S. to get away from the advancing centre of the\r\nwhirlwind, on which course we would have to steer for the N. extremity of\r\nthe Island of Formosa.\r\n\r\nThe night of 18th and 19th of August was, in the fullest sense of the\r\nword, a night of storms. Towards midnight we once more set double-reefed\r\nforesail in order to lie our course of west by south. Had we calculated\r\naright the course of the centre of the _cyclone_, the wind as we advanced\r\nshould have drawn ahead, as we were now keeping it on our larboard beam.\r\n\r\nDaybreak of the 19th found us beneath a gloomy, angry-looking, cloudy grey\r\ncanopy on every side, the clouds hanging quite low, till they seemed to\r\nbrood upon the surface of the sea, now lashed into fury by the violence of\r\nthe storm. The look-out could scarcely see a cable's length clear of the\r\nship. Deluges of rain, lashes of spray, driven on board by the tremendous\r\nviolence of the wind, enveloped us in a strange, half-mysterious\r\nobscurity. Towards the N.E. a compact bank of bluish grey clouds indicated\r\nthe centre of the _cyclone_. The motion of the ship was so violent that\r\none of her quarter-boats got filled with water, which at every lurch was\r\nwashed upon the frigate's quarter-deck like a small cascade. Sometimes\r\nthey became so full that they threatened to wrench the davits from their\r\nfastenings. The gun-deck was afloat with spray lashed on board with each\r\npitch of the ship, while the foam flew high up upon the mast. The waves\r\ncrossed each other in every direction, huge conical masses rising suddenly\r\nto a height of 25 or 30 feet, as far as one might guess, and then as\r\nsuddenly subsiding. It was the genuine pyramidal sea of the true\r\n_cyclone_, of which vessels caught in these furious circular storms are\r\neven more apprehensive than the fury and strength of the hurricane.\r\n\r\nThe wind, which now began to draw to the westward, indicated that thus far\r\nwe had shaped a proper course, and that the course of the _cyclone_ lay\r\ntowards the N.W. Under these circumstances it was deemed most prudent to\r\nmake the Marianne Islands, and to avail ourselves even of the hurricane in\r\norder to perform a rapid voyage. We accordingly now laid our course to\r\nsteer S.E. by S., through the centre of the channel south of the Loo-Choo\r\nIslands. Considering the width, 120 nautical miles, of this channel, there\r\nwas reason to hope that, despite the errors in reckoning which were to be\r\nexpected amid so many man[oe]uvres, and considering the impossibility of\r\ngetting astronomical observations, and the influence of the sort of\r\ncurrents which those hurricanes usually set in motion for a short period,\r\nwe might make our way through it in safety.\r\n\r\nThe wind remained steadily in the N.W., and at first was on our port\r\nquarter. Towards noon, however, it came round to N.W. by W., so that we\r\nwere now running dead before it. We now set double-reefed foresail so as\r\nto make quicker progress. Towards 6 P.M. the hurricane woke up to its full\r\nstrength; squall followed squall, the universal covering of cloud in\r\nwhich the heavens seemed wrapped looked as though it reached to the very\r\nwaters, and the air was quite filled with spray, till when standing at the\r\nship's stern it was barely possible to distinguish the forecastle. The\r\nstorm, sweeping along above the seething water, had a singular piercing,\r\nalmost metallic, note, quite unlike the singing and whistling made among\r\nthe sails and cordage. Staggering along under close-reefed fore and main\r\nsail, and double-reefed top-sail, the frigate pressed on through the thick\r\nnight, going 14 miles an hour, through the strait between Loo-Choo and\r\nMeiaco-sima, out of the China Sea into the Pacific Ocean, whither she was\r\nbeing hurried along with such impetuous, irresistible violence by the\r\nwind, that not even the most experienced seaman could make head against\r\nit, but had, when passing from one part of the ship to the other, to warp\r\nhimself along by means of a rope made fast fore and aft.[190] At 4 P.M.\r\nthe barometer stood at its lowest (29 deg.302, the temperature at the same\r\nperiod being 66 deg.02 Fahr.), where it remained without sensible alteration\r\nfor several hours. At last, towards 9 P.M., it began slowly to rise, the\r\nsurest indication, and therefore most welcome one, that we were increasing\r\nour distance from the central point of the storm. About 11 P.M. the\r\nclouds suddenly lifted on S.S.E., the horizon began to widen; there was no\r\nlonger a doubt that the worst was over.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 20th the masts and cordage showed a thick incrustation of\r\nsalt, thus giving unmistakable evidence of the great height to which the\r\nspray had been driven. The wind was now W.S.W., and the barometer had\r\nrisen to 29 deg.5, so that we had now merely an ordinary gale to deal with,\r\nand might look upon the _cyclone_ as expended. Science had indicated the\r\nmethod of evading the centre of the circular storm, and even of making the\r\nvery hurricane subservient to our ends in driving us along our destined\r\ncourse!\r\n\r\nAt 8 A.M. the sun began to be visible by fits and starts, long enough,\r\nhowever, to permit us to make an occasional observation. According to this\r\nwe were only one mile out of our position by dead-reckoning. During the 24\r\nhours, inclusive of the period during which we lay to, we had run 218\r\nmiles in a general direction of S.E. by E. During the afternoon the sky\r\ncleared. The sea was still high, but the atmosphere gradually became\r\nclearer and more transparent, till by sundown even the large banks of\r\nclouds on the N.E. which continued to mark the centre of the _cyclone_ had\r\nentirely disappeared. The _Novara_ during this tremendous storm had proved\r\nherself a thorough sea-boat, nor was there any particular damage\r\nnoticeable on the occasion of the careful inspection to which her sails,\r\nmasts, and rigging were subjected, immediately that the weather became\r\nmore favourable. Her masts and sails, which in such a warfare of the\r\nelements she might so readily have had carried away, were all found to be\r\nuninjured, and only a few plates of her copper sheeting had been loosened\r\nby the fury of the waves, while those still clinging to the ship had been\r\nrolled up like so much paper, by the tremendous pitching of the good ship.\r\nThe quarter gallery too, which when the frigate was running before the\r\nwind was exposed to considerable danger, had sustained but little damage.\r\nSuch unfortunately was not the case with a small menagerie of rare birds\r\nand monkeys, which had been placed in cages carefully covered with linen\r\nin this, ordinarily the most sheltered, part of the vessel. The covering\r\nhad been torn away by the hurricane, and the wind had so tossed the poor\r\nthings about, that all their feathers were knocked off, and they presented\r\na most pitiable appearance. The quadrupeds too, whose cries and lowings\r\nduring the storm had already testified to their misery, were found to have\r\nsuffered severely. Two oxen and several sheep died on the 19th. All the\r\nsurviving animals lost flesh terribly during 48 hours, while those that\r\nhad been the wildest and most untameable were now quite tame and docile.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the phenomena observed during the continuation of the\r\n_cyclone_, shows that on the 18th it formed its vortex, being then about\r\nopposite the rather lofty and tolerable-sized island of Dkinawasmia of the\r\nLoo-Choo group, which must have occasioned an alteration in the direction\r\nof the wind. Owing in part to the influence of the N.E. trade, which\r\nenters the northern part of the China Sea, and at this season is gradually\r\nveering round till it completely displaces the S.W. monsoon, as also\r\nduring the S.W. monsoon itself, which blows from Formosa on the south,\r\nthere appears to exist to the northward of the latter-named island,\r\nfavoured probably by its natural configuration and physical features, a\r\nwell-defined space within which the barometer is always depressed, and in\r\nwhich the atmosphere in immediate contact with these N.E. and S.W. winds\r\nis compelled to assume a sort of whirling motion, like that of the hands\r\nof a clock, thus forming the germ as it were of a _cyclone_.\r\n\r\nSo long as the S.W. wind was blowing strongly, the centre of the _cyclone_\r\nmoved in an easterly direction, or in other words, in the direction of\r\nleast resistance. But arrested in its advance by the various island\r\ngroups, as also by the gradually increasing pressure of the S.E. and E.\r\nwinds, the _cyclone_ must, in consequence of the obstacles opposed to its\r\npath, have swung round with a sort of whirl, which once more impressed\r\nupon it a N.W. direction to the coasts of China, there to expend itself,\r\napparently in consequence of the ever-increasing pressure of the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere. During forty-eight hours, namely from 6 P.M. of\r\nthe 18th to the same hour on the 20th, we were within the range of the\r\ntyphoon itself, and on the 19th were at the nearest point to its vortex;\r\nnevertheless, judging by our lowest barometrical reading, we must have\r\nbeen at least 100 miles distant from the centre. It was the first typhoon\r\nthat visited Chinese waters in 1858, and had been predicted weeks before\r\nin the \"North China Herald,\" while the Thousand Years Almanac of the\r\nChinese calendar assigned its date for the 10th of August.\r\n\r\nOur course was now shaped for the Marianne Archipelago. For several days\r\nafter the typhoon, the weather remained unsettled, and the swell was both\r\nheavy and broken, when on 26th August we came in sight of the island of\r\nGuam or Guaham, the most southerly of the Marianne group. In twelve days\r\nwe had run 1860 miles, with the aid of the typhoon it is true, but there\r\nwas the fact, the distance had been accomplished, and as to the How? Jack\r\ngives himself little concern, so long as he reaches his goal swiftly and\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 27th we stood into the Bay of Umata, although it was\r\nvery doubtful whether we should find a secure anchorage here, considering\r\nthe S.W. wind that was blowing full into the roadstead, which is quite\r\nun-sheltered in that point of the compass. In fact, as we came nearer the\r\nland, we speedily became aware of the impracticability of anchoring here\r\neven in the best weather; while, on the other hand, it did not seem very\r\nadvisable, owing to the difficulty of getting in, to make for the\r\nexcellent harbour of San Louis de Apra, it being by no means easy, during\r\nthe prevalence of the S.W. monsoons, for a large ship to beat out, so that\r\nthey are occasionally detained there for several weeks. The order was\r\naccordingly given to luff up, so as to make tacks against the freshening\r\nwest wind, out of this bay, studded as it is with numerous coral reefs.\r\nThis proved to be a work of much time and trouble, ere we succeeded,\r\nafter many hours of anxious care, in weathering the reef.\r\n\r\nThe island of Guam, with its lofty green mountain-ridges, numberless\r\nvalleys, and thickly-wooded glades, had a cheerful and friendly aspect,\r\nbut seems but little cultivated. At Umata, where we perceived a few\r\nhouses, the Spanish flag was waving from a small fort adjoining the\r\nsettlement, which had been hoisted on the approach of the frigate.\r\n\r\nOn 30th August, in 149 deg. 53' E., we reached the eastern limit of the S.W.\r\nmonsoon, and--although not more than four days' sail from the object of\r\nour next visit, the island of Puynipet, had we met with favourable winds\r\nto waft us a little further--it was 15th September ere we came in sight of\r\nthat lovely island, for, stormy and boisterous as the beginning of this\r\nsection of our cruise had proved, not less annoying were the fickle calms,\r\nwhich kept us lying for weeks motionless, our sails idly flapping with the\r\nroll of the ship. It is a wretched depressing state of inactivity and\r\ndiscomfort, of which only those can form an idea who have been caught in a\r\ncalm on the open ocean, on board of a sailing ship,--\r\n\r\n     \"Wenn Welle ruht und jedes Luftgefluester; Wenn Meer und\r\n        Himmel schweigend sich umschlingen, Und fromm, fast wie zwei\r\n      betende Geschwister.\"\r\n\r\nWhich may be freely translated as follows:\r\n\r\n              \"When ocean smooths his wrinkled face,\r\n              And sea and sky in pray'rful silence bend,\r\n                As when, in mutual fond embrace,\r\n              Two loving sisters' vows on high ascend!\"\r\n\r\nThe original is by Nicolas Lenau.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126] Compare Gutzlaff's \"History of the Chinese Empire,\" published by K.\r\nNeumann; Stuttgart and Tuebingen, 1847.\r\n\r\n[127] The copper cash is the sole currency in use, and consists of a\r\nmixture of copper, iron, and tin. Its value, reckoned by the string of\r\n100, is variable, and is calculated according to the proportional traffic\r\nin foreign merchandise. On the average, from 1250-1300 cash are about\r\nequal to $1.00 American, or 4_s._ 2_d._ English.\r\n\r\n[128] In Shanghai the medium of exchange in common use is not as at\r\nHong-kong reckoned in dollars, but in taels, an imaginary currency of the\r\nvalue of about $1.33, so that 100 taels = $133-1/3, or about L27 15_s._\r\nMost accounts are rendered in taels, whence they are reduced into Mexican\r\ndollars, the only foreign silver that is current. When European merchants\r\nfirst came in contact with the children of the Flowery Land, the latter\r\nused to pay a sort of premium for American dollars, while for those\r\nbearing the effigies of Charles III. (known as the Karolus dollar), quite\r\na special price was paid. Gradually, however, the value sank till, as\r\nalready mentioned, 75 taels=$100. What has so often been reported of a\r\nspecial Shanghai dollar coinage is quite erroneous. There are neither gold\r\nnor silver coins struck in China, but solely of copper, and in some\r\nprovinces of iron. The term Shanghai dollar is equivalent to tael, which,\r\nas already remarked, is, like the guinea in England, unknown to commerce.\r\n1 tael=5_s._ 7_d._ English, but in trade it is taken as 6_s._ It\r\noccasionally rises as high as 6_s._ 6_d._, when the proportion between the\r\ndollar and the tael is as 100 to 72.\r\n\r\n[129] An English translation of one of these reports will be found in the\r\n1845 number of Morrison's admirably edited, but now rather rarely met\r\nwith, monthly periodical, \"The Chinese Repository.\"\r\n\r\n[130] We occasionally saw the Queen of Heaven (Kwan-Yin) represented with\r\na child in her arms, and have in our possession a piece of carved work\r\nrepresenting such a group, which we purchased in a shop at Shanghai. This\r\nelegant figure seems to be a favourite deity with the Chinese, as it\r\nfrequently adorns their little domestic altars, and is especially\r\nreverenced by the women who are desirous of the honours of maternity. The\r\nstriking similarity between this exhibition and that of the Holy Virgin,\r\nas we see her represented in Catholic Churches, with the infant Jesus in\r\nher arms, must involuntarily suggest the idea that there has been an\r\ninfusion of Catholicism intermingled here with the rites of Buddha. If the\r\nresemblance between the two is not accidental, it may readily be assumed\r\nthat the same thing has occurred here as in the case of certain Christian\r\nlegends, which the traveller encounters among various races, on whom the\r\nbeams of Christian civilization have never been shed.\r\n\r\n[131] The price of each meal is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1 bowl of rice,                                   12 cash (1/2 _d._)\r\n  1    \"    vegetables,                              \"  \"   (1/2 _d._)\r\n  1 cup of tea,                                      6  \"   (1/4 _d._)\r\n  Breakfast, consisting usually of rice,\r\n      vegetables, and tea,                          30  \"   (1-1/4 _d._)\r\n  Bed, fire, and attendance,                        20  \"   (7/8 _d._)\r\n\r\n[132] This sacrificial paper, coloured and written upon, is usually called\r\n\"Joss\" or \"Sycee\"-paper in Canton-English, because the prayers addressed\r\nto the Divinity are usually for riches and silver ingots (_Sycee_), which\r\nthe suppliants hope to obtain by entreaty.\r\n\r\n[133] Properly spelt _Kong-fu-tseu_, from which the Europeans have\r\nconstructed the Latinized name Confucius. _Kong-fu-tseu_ (sometimes also\r\nwritten _Kong-tse_) was born 550 B.C. in the city of Kio-siu-bien, in the\r\nmodern province of Shantung.\r\n\r\n[134] Lao-tse (Lao-tseu), born B.C. 504, in the village of Knio-schin, in\r\nthe kingdom of Thsu, held the post of keeper of the archives of the palace\r\nunder the Tscheu dynasty. In his Book of Philosophy (Tao-te-king) the\r\nfollowing remarkable words occur: \"The rule of antiquity has been, not to\r\nshed light on the people, but to keep them in ignorance. A people that\r\ncomprehends is difficult to govern. On this subject men say, Whoso governs\r\na kingdom in knowledge, the same is the destroyer of that kingdom; whoso\r\ngoverns a kingdom assigning no reason, the same maintains that kingdom. In\r\nthe family, in the school, children are brought up among idols. When they\r\nenter school in the morning they are taught to do honour to the image of\r\nKong-tse. This custom must be forthwith dispensed with.\" (Compare J. R.\r\nKaeuffer's History of Eastern Asia, for \"Friends of the History of\r\nMankind,\" Leipzig, Brockhaus, 1859, vol. ii. p. 64, and K. F. Neumann's\r\nEastern Asiatic History, Leipzig, W. Engilmann, 1861, p. 129.)\r\n\r\n[135] Copper coins, struck by a ruler with whose reign any memorable\r\noccurrences are associated, command a high price as health-giving amulets.\r\nSome of these, those, for instance, of the Ming and Sing dynasties, have\r\nvery special healing virtues attributed to them. The currency of\r\nTsching-ta (1506-1522) are unfailing preservatives against the perils of\r\npregnancy, and the illnesses consequent thereon. Others are held in great\r\nhonour as prophylactics. The mode of application consists in the invalid\r\ndragging them by a cord over various parts of his body in a certain\r\nprescribed order.\r\n\r\n[136] The Chinese attribute the most marvellous healing powers to water,\r\nand accordingly apply it in a variety of forms, in numbers of maladies of\r\nthe most dissimilar character. Water, cold, tepid, warm, and hot, as also\r\nsnow and iced-water, figure among the list of medicaments, as do also\r\nrain-water, well and river-water, brackish water, dew, water from any eddy\r\nor whirlpool, or a stream, boiling water, and steam.\r\n\r\n[137] The Chinese women are for this reason anxious to keep their children\r\nat the breast for two or three years and even longer, partly by way of\r\nspeculating upon their having a constant breast of milk, and in this\r\nsingular manner make up for any deficiency of cow's milk, between the\r\nmarket demand and the actual supply. A Chinese who possesses five or six\r\nconcubines in addition to his legitimate spouse, may thus boast of a\r\nregular dairy farm. As sailors on arriving in port are usually excessively\r\nfond of milk, which they drink in large quantities, we were not a little\r\namazed on learning from a physician at Hong-kong the source whence in all\r\nprobability had been derived the milk that was so plentifully supplied!\r\n\r\n[138] In German _Bruch-porzellan_, in French _porcelaine-craquelee_.\r\n\r\n[139] _Description generale de la Chine._\r\n\r\n[140] Not alone this oil-cake, but ground horns and bones, hair from the\r\nbeard, and nail-parings, rust, ashes, and even human excrement are used as\r\nmanure. And it is a singular fact that the price of the latter varies\r\naccording to the race of men by whom it has been evacuated. The\r\nsucculently nourished flesh-eating English and Americans are in this\r\nrespect in far greater demand than the more sparely-fed cross-breeds;\r\nwhile the Chinese, subsisting almost exclusively upon fish and vegetables,\r\nare in respect to the value of their _faeces_ as manure, behind every other\r\nrace inhabiting the country. The price of this manure varies with the\r\nquality from one dollar to three dollars the _picul_. This custom of\r\ncollecting and disposing of human excrement for manure is much more\r\nextensively observed in the interior of the Empire than in the provinces\r\nalong the coast. \"If,\" writes M. Huc, the well-known missionary,--\"if we\r\nwere not aware to what perfection the denizens of the Celestial Empire\r\nhave carried the art of manuring, one would be at a loss how to reconcile\r\nthe fondness of John Chinaman for making money with the conveniences free\r\nof all charge which the proprietors of the soil everywhere erect for the\r\ncomfort of travellers. There is not a city nor a village in which this is\r\nnot universally the case. In the most crowded streets, or the most\r\nout-of-the-way abandoned spot, one frequently marvels to find these\r\n\"cabinets\" in cane-work, earth, or even masonry. One is almost tempted to\r\nbelieve he is in a country where the care to provide plenty of public\r\nlatrines is pushed to the extreme. Utilization, however, furnishes a\r\nsufficient explanation of all these edifices.\"\r\n\r\n[141] In every part of this extensive empire, travellers encounter these\r\nnational tributes to the memory of distinguished women, and Dr. Medhurst,\r\nas also Fortune and other authorities upon China, relate numerous\r\ninstances of these remarkable memorials. One of these, an archway of\r\nstone, is spoken of by Medhurst as of singular beauty. It is half a mile\r\nfrom the city of Kwang-Tib, and was erected by the community of that\r\nregion, with the approval of the Emperor, in honour of a lady of that\r\ncity, of singular piety and benevolence. Over the portico are inscribed\r\nthe words \"Kin-sin-tsae-tschung\" (a golden and perfect heart precisely in\r\nthe middle).\r\n\r\n[142] In the hospital, in what is called the western suburb of Canton,\r\nwhich was under the charge of Dr. Hobson from 1848 to 1858, the annual\r\nnumber of patients of both sexes under treatment averaged upwards of\r\n20,000. During the most unhealthy season (May and June) the number\r\nimploring assistance frequently amounted to from 3000 to 3400. In the\r\ndispensary there were, moreover, from 200 to 250 patients, who received\r\nmedical advice three times a week, and were supplied with medicaments\r\ngratuitously.\r\n\r\n[143] We saw this huge work in the private library of the chief of the\r\nmedical staff at Hong-kong, Dr. W. A. Harland, who had conceived the idea\r\nof publishing a more important work upon Chinese drugs, when death struck\r\ndown this distinguished and most industrious gentleman while in the active\r\ndischarge of his duties.\r\n\r\n[144] In the Leper village near Canton, which is under the superintendence\r\nof a Chinese physician, there are about 100 lepers of both sexes, each of\r\nwhom receives about 20 cash (not quite one penny) daily for his support.\r\nThe superintendents stated to Dr. Hobson, who repeatedly visited the\r\nvillage, as the result of their many years' experience and observations,\r\nthat leprosy is not in every case transmitted from parents to children;\r\nthat several wives of leprous persons have no trace whatever of the\r\ndisease, but that these women in all probability belong to those of the\r\nthird and fourth generation, who wholly escape. The Chinese overseers and\r\nattendants, however, can have had as little opportunity for remarking upon\r\nthe breaking out of leprosy among the children of those whose parents were\r\nentirely exempt from it as they had of informing themselves with accuracy\r\nas to the various forms and rapid diffusion of the disease in the case of\r\nthe one, or its mild type and gradual disappearance in the other.\r\nPerspiration or suppuration in the diseased parts are never remarked in\r\nthese patients.\r\n\r\n[145] At the Refuge for the Destitute (_Monegu choultry_) at Madras, where\r\nDr. Mudge was at the same time instituting experiments lasting over two\r\nyears, exhibiting these same remedies in every form and shape of\r\nelephantiasis, to which cases a special ward had been set apart, rarely\r\nentertaining fewer than 100 patients, that gentleman found it to be\r\nperfectly inoperative, and he accordingly entirely ceased prescribing it.\r\nIn lieu of the Tscharul Mugra, the Hindoos in cases of leprosy make use of\r\nwhat are known as the \"Asiatic pills,\" consisting of arsenic, pepper, and\r\nthe root of the _Asclepia gigantea_.\r\n\r\n[146] In an old Chinese medical work occurs the following remarks upon the\r\nplant: \"Tae-fung-tzi. Taste, acrid and burning: imported from the South\r\n(this obviously alludes to the Straits of Malacca). Acts as an alterative\r\non the blood, and is accordingly useful in cases of leprosy, when the\r\nblood is corrupted. The oil pressed from the seeds is also used as a\r\nremedy in ulcers, eruptions, and psoriasis, and for killing worms. This\r\ndrug must be exhibited in the form of pills.\"\r\n\r\n[147] Geography, Statistics, and Natural History of the Chinese\r\nEmpire--New York, 1847; Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese language--Canton,\r\n1856; Chinese Commercial Guide. Fourth edition--Canton, 1856.\r\n\r\n[148] In the figures of the Chinese original, which represents the\r\nLo-hau-miau or Buddhist aboriginal, Buddha is represented in a cavity of a\r\nrock. Two burning lamps are standing beside him, one on each side, and in\r\nfront are two worshippers in devotional attitudes, while at a short\r\ndistance one perceives a woman with a little child, who is approaching the\r\ndivinity. The men wear fox-tails as ornaments to the head, and their long\r\nlocks hang loose and dishevelled, far below the shoulders. Every year on\r\nthe third day of the third moon, our Chinese traveller goes on to state,\r\nold and young, man, woman, and child, bring offerings of fruit to Buddha,\r\nand for that and the three next succeeding days, they sing and dance, and\r\nat the same time make offerings of all manner of _cooked_ food. From their\r\ncustom of wearing a fox-tail on their heads, which was also common among\r\nthe ancestors of the present Mantchoos, and that these wild tribes\r\nreverence the image of Buddha, Dr. Bridgman is disposed to class them\r\namongst foreign nations.\r\n\r\n[149] Among these there were, besides a small quantity of Sorghum, several\r\nspecies of vegetables, which are suited for cultivation in temperate\r\nclimates, such, for example, as Poussen, Pa-tse, Pon-ta-tse, with which\r\nsince our return experiments have been instituted in various parts of the\r\nAustrian Empire. M. de Montigny has also since our return sent, quite\r\nlately, a large quantity of Chinese seeds by way of souvenir, and despite\r\nillness, is so much interested in forwarding the objects of the Imperial\r\nExpedition, that he was a short time ago decorated with an Austrian order.\r\n\r\n[150] We are however in a position to furnish an extract from the\r\nnote-book of an English sailor, left in charge of the yacht of an English\r\nmerchant at Shanghai, who accompanied the expedition of Lord Elgin to the\r\nPei-ho as coxswain. Notwithstanding the occasional _naive_ expressions\r\nmade use of, it is a valuable narrative, such as may call up many strange\r\nreflections in the mind of the reader:--\r\n\r\n\"1858. May 30th.--The river Pei-ho is about 150 yards wide at its mouth,\r\nand at dead low water varies from 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 fathoms in depth. On the\r\nbar, which is two miles wide, the difference between the ebb and the flood\r\nis from 9 to 10 feet. Easterly winds cause the highest tides. In the\r\ninterior, near Tien-Tsin, the river is from 3 to 6 fathoms deep, and from\r\n50 to 100 fathoms wide. Countless villages stud the banks. The houses are\r\nbuilt of clay or straw. The boys run about naked to an age of eight years.\r\nIt is a very wretched population. The coolies plunge into the water after\r\nthe empty bottles which are swimming about. They seem exceedingly willing\r\nto be serviceable to foreigners. At Tien-Tsin, ten and a half hours from\r\nthe mouth of the river, the thermometer marks 89 deg. Fahr. in the shade. Lord\r\nElgin is living in a private house on shore. The interpreters live in a\r\npassenger-junk. Provisions are on the whole cheaper than at Shanghai. An\r\nimmense number of natives keep crowding open-mouthed round the\r\n\"barbarians\" and their ship during the entire day, hundreds following us\r\nat every step. Almost all the shops are shut, through dread of the\r\nbarbarians.\"\r\n\r\n\"4th June.--Thermometer 95 deg. The people very willing to supply the\r\nstrangers with water, tea, &c. The natives are on the average from five to\r\nfive feet three and well-proportioned. Some of them are \"tremendously\"\r\nfat, with huge heads. Among the entire lot I could not see one single\r\nwoman. The streets are narrow, filthy, and uneven. Saw several hand-carts,\r\nwhich were used to convey water from the river to the village. On each\r\nbarrow there could be from six to eight buckets of water. There were also\r\nplenty of mules and donkeys, but very few horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 18.--This day the Russian minister concluded his treaty. A Russian\r\ncourier starts to-morrow for St. Petersburg with dispatches.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 26th.--At 6 P.M. to-day the treaty with England was signed. Went in\r\nprocession to the town. All the shipping dressed with flags, and manned\r\nyards. The festivities went off in the Yamun. Lord Elgin sat at the middle\r\ntable, with a Mandarin on each side of him. I hear their names were\r\nWa-schu-nau and Kwei-liang. The first-named is a strong, corpulent man of\r\nabout 45; the latter is much older, and seemed very much dejected; he has\r\nhowever just recovered from sickness, which may account for it. After the\r\nceremonies of signing and sealing had been gone through, they all partook\r\nof refreshments provided by the Mandarin. Lord Elgin proposed a toast to\r\nthe health of the Emperor of China, and to the future friendship of the\r\ntwo nations, which was responded to by the Mandarins. Shortly after the\r\nassembly broke up, and we all marched home to the excellent music of the\r\nflag-ship's band and the bugles of the marines. The whole affair lasted\r\nabout three hours and a half. It was full moon, and a splendid night.\r\n\r\n\"June 27th.--This afternoon the treaty with the French was signed.\r\nReturned to their ships by torch-light, port-fires, &c. &c. Ki-ying, the\r\nMandarin who assisted in bringing about the treaty, was sentenced to be\r\ndecapitated, as he was blamed for opening the door to the barbarians, but\r\nhe has since been pardoned.\"\r\n\r\n\"July 3rd.--News came from Pekin that Ki-ying has committed suicide by\r\ncutting his throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"July 4th.--Thermometer 96 deg. on board, despite awnings and sprinkling the\r\nroof of the wheel-house with water!\"\r\n\r\n\"July 6th.--Left Tien-Tsin. After a long, tedious, and tiresome passage of\r\n15 days we reached Shanghai once more on 21st July, all well.\r\n\r\n\"Price of provisions at Tien-Tsin, as contracted for on 28th May, for the\r\nsupply of the English fleet:--\r\n\r\n  Oxen (average weight 4 piculs, or 533 lbs.), the carcase      $10\r\n  Sheep,                                         \"                2\r\n  Hens,                                        per dozen          1\r\n  Geese and ducks,                               \"                2\r\n  Eggs,                                        per thousand       3\r\n  Vegetables,                               picul=133-1/2 lbs.  1.50\r\n  Rice,                                          \"                5\r\n  Sugar,                                         \"                6\r\n  Yams,                                        per dozen          1\r\n  Pears,                                       per hundred        1\r\n  Apples,                                        \"              1.50\r\n  Ice,                                         per lb.           16\r\n\r\n\"All articles to be delivered of the best quality. The prices are reckoned\r\nin American dollars. Every morning a boat was sent off to the\r\n_Coromandel_, on board which the purchases took place.\"\r\n\r\n[151] The Tau-Tai, whose authority extends over the three prefectures of\r\nSoo-Chow, Sung-Kiang, and Tai-tsing in the north-east of the province of\r\nKiang-ti, is under the governor of Soo-chow, and has resided at Shanghai\r\never since that port was thrown open to trade. His salary by law is only\r\n4000 _taels_ (L1445), but the various perquisites and emolument attached\r\nto it make his actual income about 365,000 _taels_ or L105,000 per annum;\r\nout of which he has, however, to defray all expenses of subordinates, &c.;\r\nso that the net annual income of this post is estimated at from 25,000 to\r\n30,000 _taels_ (L7000 to L8700). Besides the Tau-Tai there is only the\r\nTschi-hien, a sort of magistrate who lives in Shanghai, and trades with\r\nthe foreigners.\r\n\r\n[152] As another example of an interview with the highest class of Chinese\r\nofficials, we must briefly describe one enjoyed by some of our Expedition\r\nwith a Mandarin named Li-hoi-wan. He received them in a chamber of his\r\nhouse, in which were a few small tables and chairs, while at the other end\r\nwas an elevated cushioned seat on which sate Li-hoi-wan, a large stout\r\nman. He wore a Mandarin hat, with a blue button, and a greyish blue coat\r\nreaching to the ground. He saluted the foreigners by folding his palms\r\nacross his breast, invited them to be seated on the dais beside him, and\r\nordered cigars and tea to be brought. Afterwards sweetmeats of every\r\ndescription, confectionery, and fruit were served, as also Chinese wines,\r\nthe latter, to judge by their flavour and their fragrance, seeming as\r\nthough they must have hailed from a perfumery store rather than a wine\r\ncellar. Two days after the Chinese, with delicate courtesy, returned the\r\nvisit at their quarters in the residence of M. Probst, the Consul for\r\nOldenburg. Punctually at the appointed hour three far-resounding taps of\r\nthe gong were heard, a foot-soldier of police presented a flaming red\r\n\"_carte de viste_,\" bearing the name and titles of Li-hoi-wan, who\r\nforthwith was received by the travellers at the threshold, in compliance\r\nwith Chinese customs. He was attired in heavy silk clothes, his fan in an\r\nelegantly worked sheath, a gold lever watch in his girdle, and was in\r\nexcellent spirits. The hospitable host had, according to the custom of the\r\ncountry, prepared a chow-chow, or collation, at which, however, instead of\r\nSamschoo, champagne was the prevailing beverage. A few days later the\r\nMandarin visited his newly acquired friends on board the frigate, and\r\nbegged their acceptance of a variety of presents, such as silks, nuts,\r\ntea, dried fruits, and Chinese maxims and proverbs, written on long rolls\r\nof paper, that, as he naively expressed it, we might think of him \"as a\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\n[153] Mr. Hogg has since left that firm, and with his brother, Mr. Edward\r\nJ. Hogg, has established the firm of Hogg Brothers, in Shanghai.\r\n\r\n[154] Under the Emperor Yang-ti of the Tsin dynasty, which filled the\r\nthrone during the 6th century, more than 1600 miles of canals were partly\r\nconstructed, partly rebuilt and repaired, the immense works being\r\ndistributed among the soldiery and the inhabitants of the cities and\r\nvillages. Each family was bound to furnish one man, between the ages of 15\r\nand 20, whom the Government only found in provisions. The soldiers, on\r\nwhom devolved the heaviest portion of the work, received higher pay. Some\r\nof these canals, which were the making of the commerce of the interior,\r\nand thus were of the utmost service to the welfare of the Empire, were\r\nforty feet wide, and were planted on either bank with elms and willows.\r\n\r\n[155] These lanterns, often beautifully carved and otherwise adorned, are\r\namong the most characteristic furniture of a Chinese room. Into their\r\nmanufacture enter not alone glass, horn, silk, paper, &c., but also the\r\nglutinous matter derived from a species of sea-tangle (_Gigartina\r\ntenax_--called by the Malays _Agar-Agar_), with which the paper employed\r\nin covering the sides of the lantern is fastened on. In the silk and paper\r\nmanufactures too this omnipresent Agar-Agar paste plays so important a\r\npart, that above 500 piculs at $2 a picul, are annually imported from the\r\nIndian Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[156] Vide Huc's Chinese Empire, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n[157] The Chinese find it not less inexplicable that we use such\r\nmurderous-looking instruments to divide and convey our food to our mouths,\r\nwith which they think we must every moment be in danger of wounding our\r\nlips or putting our eyes out, than that we should remove the bones from\r\nthe flesh, or crack the shells of nuts and almonds, both which operations\r\nseem to them excessively absurd. In fact, it is no mere bon-mot which\r\nrepresents a Chinese gazing in astonishment at Europeans playing\r\nbilliards, or nine-pins, waltzing, or \"polking,\" and remarking, with an\r\nill-concealed assumption of superiority, that wealthy people ought to\r\nleave such fatiguing things to be done by their servants!!\r\n\r\n[158] Since the well-known minister and envoy to Japan.\r\n\r\n[159] Since sacked by the Tai-ping rebels.\r\n\r\n[160] Abandoned after a large part of the course of the Yang-tse had been\r\nexplored. Lieutenant-Colonel Sarel published lately a most interesting and\r\nvaluable pamphlet on this expedition, of which he was the leader, under\r\nthe title, \"Notes on the River Yang-tse-kiang from Hankow to Ping-Shan.\r\nHong-kong, Printed at Noronka's office.\"\r\n\r\n[161] Report of the deputation, appointed by the British Chamber of\r\nCommerce in Shanghai, on the commercial capabilities of ports and places\r\non the Yang-tse-kiang visited by the expedition under Vice-Admiral Sir\r\nJames Hope, K.C.B., in February and March, 1861.

Medhurst, Sen.\r\nShanghai, 1846.\r\n\r\n[163] Thus Yuen-tschin in the third month (April of our calendar), Chay\r\nand Yuen in the fourth month (May), Gae-tschin in the fifth month (June),\r\nSai in the sixth month (July), Han-tschin in the seventh month (August),\r\nSze-tschan in the ninth month (October), and Hau in the tenth month\r\n(November).\r\n\r\n[164] The value of a tael, as already stated, varies from 6_s._ to 6_s._\r\n6_d._ It is estimated that a bale of silk, until it is shipped at Shanghai\r\nfor England, has cost from L80 to L100 sterling.\r\n\r\n[165] The word _Cha_ is, however, used by the Chinese to designate not the\r\ntea plant alone, but every description of _Camelia_.\r\n\r\n[166] Arabian travellers who visited China in the 9th century, A.D. 850,\r\nspeak thus early of tea, as of a beverage in universal use. According to\r\nKaempfer tea was introduced from China into Japan about A.D. 519, by a\r\nnative prince named Daeme, who, during his residence in China, had learned\r\nits invaluable properties. The Japanese, however, do not drink their tea\r\nas an infusion, but grind the leaves into powder, pour hot water upon\r\nthem, and stir them with a bamboo-stick till they are thoroughly mingled\r\ntogether, when they swallow the decoction and the powder together, as is\r\ndone with coffee in some parts of Asia.\r\n\r\n[167] The term \"Bohea\" is in fact only a corruption of the Chinese Wu-yi,\r\nwhich again is derived from Wu-i-kien, a well-known Chinese divinity.\r\n\r\n[168] In Java, where the tea plant has been cultivated for a series of\r\nyears, the mountain region from 4000 to 5000 feet above the sea, and with\r\nan average temperature of from 58 deg.1 to 73 deg.7, Fahr., has been found best\r\nadapted for the growth of the plant.\r\n\r\n[169] The first scientific arrangement of the tea plant according to dried\r\nspecimens was made in 1753 by Linnaeus, who in his _Species Plantarum_\r\nincluded among these one species, which he called _Thea Sinensis_. But by\r\nthe time the second edition of his renowned work made its appearance in\r\n1762, Linnaeus found himself compelled to make two species of it, and to\r\nassign them the names by which they are known to the present day. The\r\nfirst living tea plant was brought to Europe in October, 1763, by a ship\r\ncaptain named Ekeberg, and planted in the Botanic Garden of Upsala.\r\n\r\n[170] According to Fortune (\"A Residence among the Chinese.\" London, 1857.\r\nMurray), the various sorts of tea have added to them from two to four\r\nspoonfuls of a mixture in which the plant _ma-ki-holy_ largely enters, as\r\nalso indigo and pulverized _gypsum_, in order to increase the green tinge\r\nof the leaves.\r\n\r\n[171] A picul, 133-1/3 lbs., of these leaves costs on the average 15 to 18\r\ndollars, though it occasionally ranges as high as 30 dollars.\r\n\r\n[172] In the year 1859, the exports into England were 30,988,598 lbs.\r\n(viz. 22,292,702 lbs. black, and 8,695,896 lbs. green), out of a total\r\nexport of 55,328,731 lbs. Within the same period 19,952,147 lbs. went to\r\nthe United States, 1,879,584 lbs. to Australia; to Hong-kong, and other\r\nports along the coast of China, 1,261,347 lbs.; to Montreal, 510,600 lbs.,\r\nand to the entire continent of Europe 736,455 lbs.\r\n\r\n[173] Some experiments on a small scale were made with the _Sorgho_ at\r\nAquileia near Goerz, by M. Karl Ritter, a well-known merchant and sugar\r\nrefiner, of Trieste. We were shown samples of refined sugar, extracted\r\nfrom the _Sorgho_, which promised the best results. A large quantity of\r\nseeds which were sent a year ago to one of the members of the _Novara_\r\nExpedition by M. de Montigny, had been made use of to institute a series\r\nof experiments in cultivation, in those parts of the Empire, the climatic\r\nconditions of which promised to be most favourable for the growth of the\r\n_Sorgho_.\r\n\r\n[174] During our stay at Shanghai we also made inquiries as to an alleged\r\nnew species of potato, concerning which there have been current for years\r\nsuch contradictory accounts in the European and American journals, that\r\nthe foreign community of Shanghai was beset with inquiries from all parts\r\nof the world, begging for more accurate information as to this newly\r\ndiscovered tuber, which promised to supply a much-needed substitute for\r\nthe apparently effete, worn-out, disease-smitten potato of Peru. No one,\r\nhowever, could furnish us with the slightest information on the subject,\r\nand ultimately it became apparent that the rumours hitherto current were\r\nfounded on an erroneous impression. It would seem, according to the\r\nopinion of Mr. Fortune, that the rumour first arose from mistaking for a\r\nnew sort of potato, the _Calladium esculentum_, which is quite commonly\r\nexposed for sale in the streets of Shanghai, and the small tubers of\r\nwhich, both in flavour and external appearance, resemble those of the\r\npotato, when, without taking the slightest further trouble to inquire into\r\nthe matter, the pretended new discovery, fraught with such important\r\nresults for the poorer classes, was duly trumpeted to the entire world. In\r\nno part of China hitherto accessible was there at the time of our visit\r\nany other description of potato in use than the common Peruvian. Officers\r\nof the English and American navies, who at the time of the first Peace of\r\nTien-Tsin were eating potatoes in the Gulf of Petcheli, assured us that\r\nthey were precisely identical with those that have so long been\r\nacclimatized in Europe. Of edible tubers there are at Shanghai, besides\r\npotatoes, the yam (_Dioscorea_ sp.) and the Yucca (_Jatropha_ sp.).\r\n\r\n[175] The following is the process as we observed it: the bamboo strips\r\nare first soaked for a considerable period in water, after which they are\r\npeeled, and again saturated with lime-water, until they are perfectly\r\nflexible. After this, they are converted, according to the method in use\r\nat that special locality, either by water power or hand labour, into a\r\nfluid of a pap-like viscosity, after which it is boiled till it has\r\nattained the requisite fineness and consistency for conversion into paper.\r\n\r\n[176] These consist chiefly of cotton and woollen goods of every\r\ndescription, steel cutlery, iron-ware, glass, clocks, watches, musical\r\nclocks, tin-ware, &c.\r\n\r\n[177] The quantity of home-grown opium, chiefly produced in the province\r\nof Yun-nan, cannot be accurately ascertained, as the returns are not made\r\nat certain points; but the quantity must fall far short of the amount\r\nimported from India.\r\n\r\n[178] According to MacCulloch's Commercial Dictionary, opium had been\r\nintroduced into China and India by the commencement of the 16th century by\r\nMahometan merchants, and it sounds like an apology when the learned and\r\npatriotic author, in treating of the part taken by England in the\r\nmuch-to-be-lamented traffic in this noxious drug, adds by way of\r\npalliation--\"A century and a half before the English had _anything_\r\nwhatever to do with its _cultivation_.\"--(Latest edition, p. 939.)\r\n\r\n[179] Only a certain number (originally twelve) of wealthy Chinese\r\nmerchants, \"Hong,\" were permitted by law to trade with foreigners at\r\nCanton. They had not only to account to Government for all duties and\r\ntaxes, but were likewise responsible for the good behaviour of the\r\nstrangers!\r\n\r\n[180] It is a coincidence worthy of notice, that simultaneously with the\r\nrise of the opium trade with China, the importation of slaves into America\r\nbegan to increase, and that European commerce in these two infamous\r\ntraffics seemed to be ever increasing and gaining ground in Eastern Asia\r\nand in America! At the end of last century the number of slaves in the\r\nSouthern States of the Union was little greater than that of opium-smokers\r\nin China: at present the number of the former is about 4,000,000, and the\r\nlatter may be put at about the same figure; the latter, slaves of their\r\nown intemperate passions,--the former, of the covetousness and cold\r\ncalculating selfishness of their masters. The opium question and the slave\r\nquestion--these two seem destined to be solved simultaneously!\r\n\r\n[181] A very similar result is arrived at by MacCulloch, who calculates\r\nthat the Company cleared 7_s._ 6_d._ per lb. on opium, which they bought\r\nby their agents from the Bengal ryots at 3_s._ 6_d._ per pound, and\r\nretailed at 11_s._ per pound.\r\n\r\n[182] There are indeed smokers who smoke their two, four, five, and even\r\neight drachms per diem, but these are solitary instances, while the very\r\ncostliness of the article forbids the use of the narcotic to the great\r\nmass of the population, except in the very smallest quantities.\r\n\r\n[183] One poem of the Chinese Imperial Pretender, which is not included in\r\nDr. Medhurst's collection of the writings published by the insurgent press\r\nat Nankin, and for a copy of which we have to thank Mr. Meadows,\r\nGovernment interpreter at Shanghai, has lately been translated by our\r\nlearned countryman, Dr. Pfitzmaier. The splendidly got up binding of this\r\nlittle book is of a golden yellow on the title page, and red on the\r\nreverse; the river Yang-tse-kiang appears to pay homage to the Tai-ping,\r\nwhose residence it surrounds. The title printed on the exterior of the\r\nwrapper runs as follows: \"Imperial announcements in theses upon the words\r\nof the Heavenly Father, the Most High Ruler.\" The title within is: \"Ten\r\npoems upon Supreme Felicity,\" although these so-called poems are simply\r\nstrophes, never exceeding four verses of seven feet. The writing bears\r\ndate the number _Kuei-hao_ (50), corresponding to A.D. 1853, the third\r\nyear of the reign of the Heavenly King, Tai-ping. The whole production is,\r\nif that be possible, yet more bombastic, unintelligible, and stupid than\r\nChinese poems usually are to Western readers.\r\n\r\n[184] Between February and September, 1855, there were executed in Canton\r\n70,000 persons all told. Many of the rebel leaders were, in conformity\r\nwith the _penal laws_, hewed in numerous pieces while yet living; a\r\ncertain Kausin in 108! See K. F. Neumann's History of Eastern Asia, from\r\nthe first Chinese war to the Treaty of Pekin, 1840-1860. Leipzig,\r\nEngelmann, 1861.\r\n\r\n[185] We extract from the _London and China Telegraph_ of 31st March,\r\n1862, the following severe but just criticism on this gentleman, whose\r\nletter, which we also quote, shows him to be a person of but limited\r\neducation:--\"Even the Rev. J. Roberts, who, as our readers are aware, has\r\nlived with the rebels at Nankin, and has to his discredit defended their\r\nconduct in the strongest possible manner, has at length discovered that\r\nthey are nothing better than robbers and murderers. This change of opinion\r\nin a man who on all occasions so confidently urged the claims of the\r\nTai-pings, arose from a very simple cause:--he at length suffered,\r\npersonally, from their barbarity. A servant to whom he was attached was\r\nkilled before his eyes; and considering his life in danger, he fled to\r\nShanghai, and wrote the following letter, dated 22nd January, 1862,\r\nreprobating the conduct of his former friends:--'From having been the\r\nreligious teacher of Hung Sow-chuen in 1847, and hoping that\r\ngood--religious, commercial, and political--would result to the nation\r\nfrom his elevation, I have hitherto been a friend to his revolutionary\r\nmovement, sustaining it by word and deed, as far as a missionary\r\nconsistently could, without vitiating his higher character as an\r\nambassador of Christ. But after living among them fifteen months, and\r\nclosely observing their proceedings--political, commercial, and\r\nreligious--I have turned over entirely a new leaf, and am now as much\r\nopposed to them, for good reasons, I think, as I was ever in favour of\r\nthem. Not that I have aught personally against Hung Sow-chuen, he has been\r\nexceedingly kind to me. But I believe him to be a crazy man, entirely\r\nunfit to rule, without any organized government, nor is he, with his\r\ncoolie-kings, capable of organizing a government of equal benefit to the\r\npeople of even the old Imperial Government. He is violent in his temper,\r\nand lets his wrath fall heavily upon his people, making a man or woman 'an\r\noffender for a word,' and ordering such instantly to be murdered without\r\n'judge or jury.' He is opposed to commerce, having had more than a dozen\r\nof his own people murdered since I have been here, for no other crime than\r\ntrading in the city, and has promptly repelled every foreign effort to\r\nestablish lawful commerce here among them, whether inside of the city or\r\nout. His religious toleration and multiplicity of chapels turn out to be a\r\nfarce, of no avail in the spread of Christianity, worse than useless. It\r\nonly amounts to a machinery for the promotion and spread of his own\r\npolitical religion, making himself equal with Jesus Christ, who, with God\r\nthe Father, himself, and his own son constitute one Lord over all! Nor is\r\nany missionary, who will not believe in his divine appointment to this\r\nhigh equality, and promulgate his political religion accordingly, safe\r\namong these rebels, in life, servants, or property. He told me soon after\r\nI arrived that if I did not believe in him, I would perish, like the Jews\r\ndid for not believing in the Saviour. But little did I then think that I\r\nshould ever come so near it, by the sword of one of his own miscreants, in\r\nhis own capital, as I did the other day. Kan-Wang, moved by his elder\r\nbrother (literally a coolie at Hong-kong) and the devil, without the fear\r\nof God before his eyes, did, on Monday the 13th inst., come into the house\r\nin which I was living, then and there most wilfully, maliciously, and with\r\nmalice aforethought, murder one of my servants with a large sword in his\r\nown hand in my presence, without a moment's warning or any just cause. And\r\nafter having slain my poor harmless, helpless boy, he jumped on his head\r\nmost fiend-like and stamped it with his foot; notwithstanding I besought\r\nhim most entreatingly from the commencement of his murderous attack to\r\nspare my poor boy's life. And not only so, but he insulted me myself in\r\nevery possible way he could think of, to provoke me to do or say something\r\nwhich would give him an apology, as I then thought and I think yet, to\r\nkill me, as well as my dear boy, whom I loved like a son. He stormed at\r\nme, seized the bench on which I sat with the violence of a madman, threw\r\nthe dregs of a cup of tea in my face, seized hold of me personally, and\r\nshook me violently, struck me on my right cheek with his open hand; then,\r\naccording to the instruction of my King for whom I am ambassador, I turned\r\nthe other, and he struck me quite a sounder blow on my left cheek with his\r\nright hand, making my ear ring again; and then perceiving that he could\r\nnot provoke me to offend him in word or deed, he seemed to get the more\r\noutrageous, and stormed at me like a dog, to be gone out of his presence.\r\n'If they will do these things in a green tree, what will they do in the\r\ndry?'--to a favourite of Teen Wang's, who can trust himself among them,\r\neither as a missionary or a merchant? I then despaired of missionary\r\nsuccess among them, or any good coming out of the movement--religious,\r\ncommercial, or political--and determined to leave them, which I did on\r\nMonday, Jan. 20th, 1862.' Mr. Roberts adds that Kan-Wang had refused to\r\ngive up his clothes, books, and journals, and that he had been left in a\r\nstate of destitution. Most persons will agree that he fully deserves any\r\namount of suffering that may be inflicted on him. Mr. Roberts has done his\r\nutmost to delude Europeans as to the true character of the Tai-pings; he\r\nhas kept back some facts, has falsified others, and has acted throughout\r\nin a manner utterly inconsistent with his assumed character of a Christian\r\nmissionary. On such conduct no comment can be too severe.\"\r\n\r\n[186] Nankin accordingly is usually called now-a-days the \"City of the\r\nCoolie-Kings.\"\r\n\r\n[187] Very similar are the reports made by the English who, in Dec. 1858,\r\naccompanied Lord Elgin on his voyage of discovery up the Kiang, and\r\nremained a considerable period among the Tai-ping. \"The tenets of their\r\nreligion,\" says Mr. Laurence Oliphant (vide Earl of Elgin's Mission to\r\nChina and Japan, vol. ii. p. 463), \"consist of a singular jumbling of\r\nJewish ordinances, Christian theology, and Chinese philosophy. Like the\r\nJews in the Old Testament they wage wars of extermination, they live like\r\nthe worst professing Christians, and they believe like--Chinese.\"\r\n\r\n[188] The charges forwarded by the owners of the little _Meteor_ for\r\ntowing, and which are calculated according to the draught of water of the\r\nship towed, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+\r\n  |Itinerary or  |15 feet   |15 to     |17 to     |18 to     |19 ft. &   |\r\n  |vice versa.   |and under.|17 feet.  |18 feet.  |19 feet.  |all beyond.|\r\n  +--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+\r\n  |              |          |          |          |          |           |\r\n  |From Shanghai |300 taels,|350 taels,|450 taels,|450 taels,|500 taels, |\r\n  |to Gutzlaff's |or        |or        |or        |or        |or         |\r\n  |Island.       |L90.      |L105.     |L135.     |L135.     |L150.      |\r\n  |              |          |          |          |          |           |\r\n  |Shanghai to   |150 taels,|175 taels,|200 taels,|225 taels,|250 taels, |\r\n  |Wusung.       |or        |or        |or        |or        |or         |\r\n  |              |L45.      |L52 10_s._|L60.      |L62 10_s._|L75.       |\r\n  |              |          |          |          |          |           |\r\n  |From Wusung   |225 taels,|250 taels,|275 taels,|300 taels,|350 taels, |\r\n  |to Gutzlaff's |or        |or        |or        |or        |or         |\r\n  |Island.       |L62 10_s._|L75.      |L82 10_s._|L90.      |L105.      |\r\n  +--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+\r\n\r\n[189] Typhoon, or _Tei-fun_, a strong wind. While some authors derive this\r\nword from the Arabic _Tufan_, a violent wind, others see in it the giant\r\n_Typhos_ of Greek mythology, who was begotten by Tartarus of Earth, and\r\nfrom whom proceeded all that was disastrous and destructive. Whoever has\r\nexperienced a typhoon will most readily acquiesce in the latter\r\nderivation.\r\n\r\n[190] During this storm, we made the not uninteresting observation in a\r\nphysiological point of view, that when the gale was at its worst, even the\r\nleast hard-a-weather of us seemed quite free from sea-sickness, apparently\r\nthe result of extreme excitement. For similar reasons, men who have been\r\nbitten by a snake, and who have had raw spirits administered as an\r\nantidote, seem able to take four or five times the quantity which they can\r\non ordinary occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: Distant View of the Island of Puynipet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVI.\r\n\r\n                       The Island of Puynipet.\r\n\r\n                        18th September, 1858.\r\n\r\n    Native boats in sight.--A pilot comes on board.--Communications\r\n    of a white settler.--Another pilot.--Fruitless attempts to tack\r\n    for the island.--Roankiddi Harbour.--Extreme difficulty in\r\n    effecting a landing with the boats.--Settlement of Rei.--Dr.\r\n    Cook.--Stroll through the forest.--Excursions up the Roankiddi\r\n    River.--American missionaries.--Visit from the king of the\r\n    Roankiddi tribe.--Kawa as a beverage.--Interior of the royal\r\n    abode.--The Queen.--Mode of living, habits and customs of the\r\n    natives.--Their religion and mode of worship.--Their festivals\r\n    and dances.--Ancient monumental records and their probable\r\n    origin.--Importance of these in both a historical and geological\r\n    point of view.--Return on board.--Suspicious conduct of the\r\n    white settler.--An asylum for contented delinquents.--Under\r\n    weigh for Australia.--Belt of calms.--Simpson Island.--\"It must\r\n    be a ghost!\"--Bradley Reef.--A Comet.--The Salmon Islands.--\r\n    Rencontre with the natives of Malayta.--In sight of Sikayana.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile yet, on 16th September, 1858, five or six knots distant from the\r\nisland of Puynipet,[191] first discovered in 1828 by the Russian Admiral\r\nLuetke, and just as we found ourselves off what is called \"Middle Harbour,\"\r\nwe remarked a boat of European construction making for the frigate. Two\r\nhours later it came alongside, with four natives and a white man, the\r\nlatter of whom came on deck and offered his services to the Commodore as\r\npilot. He proved to be a Yankee named Alexander Tellet, who had lived 20\r\nyears on the island as smith and carpenter, to which he added the\r\nfunctions of pilot for the harbour in which he lived. Presently we were\r\nsurrounded by a considerable number of natives in elegant canoes streaked\r\nwith red, and formed of hollowed-out trunks of trees with outriggers,\r\nwhich have very peculiar scaffold-like supports, so that there is a kind\r\nof platform formed in the centre of the canoe, whereon the master usually\r\nseats himself, but which serves on occasion for festive meetings, and even\r\nfor a small dance! The sails, made of mats, are triangular, the most acute\r\nangle being confined between two long bamboos, while a third serves as a\r\nmast, the whole capable of being shifted to either end of the boat by one\r\nof the crew, according to the direction of the wind. While some were doing\r\nwhat they could in their small boats to keep within the speed of the\r\nfrigate, though we were going pretty fast, just as parasites make fast to\r\nthe shark, others followed us a little distance, like dolphins, those\r\nfaithful companions of ships, as far as the nearest harbour. With the\r\nexception of a short apron of cocoa-palm leaves, the natives were quite\r\nnaked, and seemed pretty well made. On their heads they wore a sort of\r\nprojecting pent-hat, also of palm-leaves, obviously intended to shield\r\nthe eyes from the vertical rays of the sun, and in form most resembling\r\nthose lamp shades which old men or youths with weak eyesight are with us\r\nin the habit of using to ward off the full glare of artificial light.\r\nAmong the natives who favoured us with their escort, there were two who\r\nfrom their personal grace, their light colour of skin, and thoroughly\r\nEuropean cast of features, especially attracted our attention. They were\r\nthe sons of an Englishman named Hadley, who had been for many years\r\nresident on Mudock island, E. of Puynipet, where he supported himself by\r\nfishing and pilotage, and had married a native woman. Shortly before our\r\narrival, Hadley had started with several hundred pounds of tortoise-shell\r\nfor Hong-kong, whence he intended to sail for England. He had intrusted\r\nhis two sons to the care of a European settler, who succeeded him as pilot\r\non Mudock island. According to all appearance, however, Hadley had little\r\nintention of returning to this island, notwithstanding the family tie that\r\nshould have bound him to it.\r\n\r\nAs we were coasting along the west side of the island about 1 to 17 miles\r\nfrom the reefs, Tellet was overwhelmed with questions on every hand and on\r\nevery possible subject, and among other subjects of information we\r\npresently found that the chief intercourse of foreign ships was carried on\r\nwith Roankiddi or Lee Harbour, some 15 or 20 miles distant, and Metetemai\r\nor Foul-weather Harbour, which lies six or seven miles E. of Roankiddi.\r\nDuring the N.E. trade (November to April), from 50 to 60 American whalers\r\nput in to Puynipet to take in wood and water, and fresh provisions,\r\nchiefly yams, taro, sweet potato, poultry, and pigs. Many ships, moreover,\r\nbound from Sydney for China prefer at that season the voyage through the\r\nPacific to passing round the south of Australia, and thence through the\r\nStraits of Sunda, or the yet more dangerous passage through Torres\r\nStraits, and usually make a tolerably fast run. Thus the Swedish corvette\r\n_Eugenie_, on her voyage round the globe, performed in November, 1852, the\r\nastonishing feat of making the passage from Sydney to Hong-kong, 5000\r\nmiles, in the unprecedentedly short space of 37 days!\r\n\r\nThe number of aborigines on this island, which is about 60 miles in\r\ncircumference, was estimated by Tellet at about 2000. Formerly it was as\r\nmany as 5000,[192] but the small-pox had since then committed fearful\r\nravages among the population. The circumstances under which this frightful\r\nscourge was first introduced into Puynipet, throw considerable light upon\r\nthe history of the spread of that disease, as well as much useful\r\ninformation upon the question of vaccination.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, the English barque _Delta_ arrived at Roankiddi Harbour, with\r\none of her crew ill with small-pox. The white settlers then on the island,\r\nwho were well acquainted with the virulence of the disease, implored the\r\nnative chief to forbid the captain's remaining, and insist on his putting\r\nto sea forthwith. The latter, however, seemed determined to leave the\r\npatient on the island. When he learned the hostile feeling of the\r\npopulation to himself and the crew, and found that they would neither take\r\nhis sick man off his hands, nor supply himself and ship's company with\r\nprovisions, he availed himself of the silence and obscurity of night to\r\ndeposit the sick man on the shore with all his property, and at daybreak\r\nmade off under full sail. Next morning the natives found the unfortunate\r\nwretch stretched suffering and utterly helpless on the strand, while the\r\nbarque was no longer in sight. Hostility to the captain was now converted\r\ninto sympathy with, and active compassion for, the sick man; a couch was\r\nprepared in an adjacent hut, and as much attention lavished on him as was\r\npossible under the circumstances; but his effects, consisting chiefly of\r\nlinen and upper clothing, were speedily appropriated by the thievish\r\nnatives. A few weeks later the small-pox broke out with frightful\r\nviolence, and raged five months with undiminished severity all over the\r\nisland. Almost every one of the natives was attacked, and of 5000\r\ninhabitants 3000 succumbed to the virulence of the epidemic. The sailor,\r\nhowever, with whom first originated this terrible fatality, completely\r\nrecovered. His clothing, scattered through every part of the island, had\r\nno doubt essentially contributed to the speedy diffusion of the malady. Of\r\nthe thirty white settlers, who had all been inoculated, only one was\r\nattacked, and he soon got well again. In August, 1854, the destroyer\r\ndisappeared almost as suddenly as he came, and has since then spared\r\nPuynipet a second visit, but wherever one goes the traces of the disease\r\nare visible in the faces and on the bodies of the natives.\r\n\r\nWhile picking up this information, we were getting nearer and nearer to\r\nRoankiddi Harbour on the S.W. of the island, and Tellet now stated he\r\ncould not undertake to conduct us further, as there resided a pilot in the\r\nharbour whom he was not unwilling to give a job to. Another boat was now\r\napproaching the frigate, which had on board the regular pilot of Roankiddi\r\nHarbour, a Virginia Negro, named Johnson. Our man Tellet now took his\r\nleave, and set out in his boat on his return to Middle Harbour. Many a\r\nlonging glance did we cast at the spot, where for the first time we were\r\nto be privileged to examine the wonders of the coral beds of the South\r\nSea. For Puynipet is one of the finest examples known of a lofty island of\r\nthe great ocean regularly hemmed in by wall-like reefs, by far the\r\nmajority of the other islands being mere low \"atolls.\" Unfortunately the\r\nbreeze was unsteady and very light; the sky looked so gloomy and\r\nthreatening that we had to haul off again from the island, and steer to\r\nthe S.E., so as not to approach the reef too closely during the night. In\r\nthe morning we once more neared the island, under the influence of a\r\ngentle west wind, having run 15 miles out during the night. Gradually the\r\nsmall wooded or rocky islets hove in sight again, which, stretching\r\nnorthward from the great central mass, 2860 feet in height, surround the\r\nlofty island like a ring, inside of the wall-reef, which encompasses it at\r\na distance of from one to two miles. We tacked about during the whole day\r\nwith light variable winds from the west, and by evening had got\r\nsufficiently near our anchorage, that every one expected by a last tack to\r\nfetch it ere night set in, when the breeze suddenly shifted, died away,\r\nand once more compelled us to withdraw to a safe distance from the island,\r\nand pass the night under easy sail. At length, on 18th September, a fresh\r\nleading wind from the westward promised to carry us in without further\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nRight in front of us, and with not a cloud to interrupt the view, lay this\r\nextinct volcano of an island, densely covered with the most luxuriant\r\nverdure. Only at its N.E. corner there sprang suddenly into the air a\r\nnaked, castellated rock, about 1000 feet high or so, cut off horizontally\r\nabove, and with perpendicular sides, which we were informed was a small\r\nisland (Dochokoits), separated by a narrow channel from the main island.\r\nGradually, on either side of the isle, several rocky points became\r\nvisible, which steadily increased in dimension, and began to stretch\r\ntowards each other, till they looked like a row of pearls densely\r\nsprinkled in the air above the horizon; after which a number of thin,\r\nsmall, white clouds suddenly rose and disappeared above the dark blue\r\nsurface of the sea, flickering here and there like flames. This was our\r\nfirst glimpse of the island-reef and the surf-beaten coral, seen under the\r\ninfluence of a mirage, when, as is very frequently the case in tropical\r\nclimates, the temperature of the surface of the water, and consequently of\r\nthe immediately adjacent strata of atmosphere, is higher than those next\r\nabove. Having got within about a couple of miles, the dark points resolved\r\nthemselves into verdant cocoa-groves, patches of which adorn the outermost\r\nreef, while the small clouds now proved to be the tumultuous lash of a\r\ntremendous blinding surf, on the reef which separated the rise and fall of\r\nthe ocean outside from the smooth placid surface of the broad channel,\r\nwhich inside the ring-shaped coral reef forms those singular natural\r\ncanals, on which the natives in their frail canoes can sail right round\r\nthe island, sheltered from the violence of the waves, and which, at those\r\nplaces where there is sufficient depth, and a breach in the line of reef\r\nadmits of ingress from without, affords for even large-sized ships a\r\nsecure harbour, according to observation in 6 deg. 47' N., 158 deg. 13' 3'' E.\r\n\r\nWe now endeavoured to enter between Nahlap Island on the west, covered\r\nwith cocoa-palms and bread-fruit, and Sandy Island on the east, surrounded\r\nwith a belt of raging foam, its coral masses clothed with low scanty\r\nbrushwood. But almost immediately \"Halt\" was once more the order. In order\r\nto get into the harbour proper, which lay between two majestic banks of\r\ncoral rising from the level of the sea like an elegantly hewn dock, we\r\nhad to pass through a very narrow channel in the reef, barely 50 fathoms\r\nwide, which indeed was pretty plainly indicated by the colour of the\r\nsmooth water, besides being well marked out by regular buoys, but winds in\r\na direction first westerly and then northwards, and accordingly was\r\ninaccessible to us with a west wind blowing. There was no alternative but\r\nto let the anchor go among the naked coral rocks forming the sub-marine\r\nplateau over which we now lay. But anxiety for the safety of the ship did\r\nnot admit of her being suffered to remain in circumstances so dangerous.\r\nWhile therefore the frigate once more made sail, a survey of the island\r\nand harbour was ordered by a boat expedition.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 A.M. the Commodore, accompanied by some of the scientific staff,\r\nset off for land in a slim, flat-floored, Venetian gondola, admirably\r\nadapted for such purposes. When we had passed the twin Nahlap Islands and\r\nSandy Island, we found ourselves in a channel about 100 fathoms in length\r\nby not quite 80 in width, which led directly into the interior of this\r\nhuge basin constructed exclusively by insects, and surrounded by a triple\r\nwall of coral, an unfathomable, mirror-like pool, in which a ship lies\r\ncalm and motionless as though in a dock. A buoy at the S.W. angle of the\r\nchannel indicates some sunken rocks. On the further side of the coral reef\r\none perceives the low-lying group of the Ants' Islands, thickly covered\r\nwith trees. Although our Venetian boat drew hardly any water, we\r\nnevertheless found great difficulty in advancing in proportion as we\r\napproached the shore. The fact too that it was ebb-tide served to increase\r\nthe obstacles that beset our progress. Every moment the gondola touched\r\nupon sand-bank or rock. The utmost caution had therefore to be exercised,\r\nas we steered for some huts which were visible under the cocoa-palms quite\r\nclose to the shore. Following the deeper more navigable channels, we\r\nreached the mouth of a river running from N.E., the low swampy soil on\r\neither side being covered with dense mangrove bushes, but all our efforts\r\nto push through the thickets so as to reach the huts proved unavailing,\r\nwhile the whole soil seemed to be beset with the stumps of the mangrove,\r\nlike so many sharp stakes. After pushing a short distance up this mangrove\r\nchannel, from which on either side smaller channels diverged, we retraced\r\nour steps, as there was no appearance of the scene changing, nor any\r\nappearance of human habitation, and endeavoured to reach the land near the\r\nhuts already mentioned, by some of the deeper channels. Just then a white\r\nsettler came to our assistance, who, standing on the shore, indicated to\r\nus by manual signs the clue out of this labyrinth of coral, and enabled us\r\nby a less shallow channel to reach one of the few points at which a\r\nlanding is practicable. For at almost every point of the shore the\r\nmangroves, by the tenacity of their roots, prevent, or at any rate impede,\r\nthe approach of boats, the natives themselves being confined to the use of\r\nthose few spots where rivers or other natural channels afford means of\r\naccess. Close to the shore appeared three wooden huts thatched with\r\nbamboo and palm-leaves. This was a small colony of whites, whom a singular\r\nfreak of destiny seemed to have cast away upon these islands, where they\r\nearned their subsistence as wood-cutters, smiths, fishermen, &c. They call\r\ntheir settlement Rei. The first hut we entered was inhabited by a\r\nScotchman, who called himself \"Dr. Cook,\" and practised as a physician. He\r\nhad lived 26 years on the island. His dwelling consisted of three large\r\napartments, which up to a certain height were shut off from each other by\r\nthin wooden walls, so that the air could circulate freely overhead\r\nthroughout the entire length of the hut. Everything was neat and orderly:\r\nin the first room, which apparently was used as a surgery, stood a number\r\nof medicine bottles duly labelled, and crucibles, which at the very first\r\nglance revealed the avocation of the possessor. Cook, who seemed far past\r\nthe half century, with pale, faded, expressionless features, and a long\r\nsilver-grey beard, clothed in a coarse woollen jacket, and with the huge,\r\nbroad-brimmed, worn-out straw-hat pulled low upon his wrinkled forehead,\r\nhad quite caught the listless, motionless deportment of the natives.\r\nNothing roused him, nothing surprised him; it took considerable time to\r\nelicit from him any reply to our questions. The other white settlers in\r\nthe adjoining islands were not much more communicative; all showed in\r\ntheir conduct a certain embarrassment, which left little doubt that theirs\r\nhad not been an altogether blameless life in former days. Most of them\r\nwere surrounded by a number of native wives, who had covered their bodies\r\nwith a powder of an intense yellow, prepared from the _Curcuma longa_,\r\nand wore merely a piece of calico round the loins, while splendid yellow\r\nblossoms set off the raven blackness of their long hair.\r\n\r\nWe now followed up a narrow footpath, which led to a gently-sloping\r\neminence behind the huts, and soon found ourselves surrounded by\r\nbread-fruit trees and banana, while from time to time a black basaltic\r\nrock cropped out from among the red, marl-like soil, and beautiful small\r\nlizards with sapphire-blue tails that shone with a metallic lustre, shot\r\nabout with the velocity of an arrow among the stones. The prevailing\r\nformation, as in almost all the volcanic islands of the Pacific, is an\r\namorphous basalt-lava, full of olivin and porphyry. On gaining the summit\r\nof the hill, we found there a solitary, wretched-looking hut. A dog, a few\r\nhens, and a phlegmatic native worn away to a shadow, whom the sudden\r\nappearance of a number of European strangers hardly seemed to rouse from\r\nhis apathy, were the only living creatures visible. On our requesting to\r\nbe furnished with a light, a wrinkled old hag crept out of the hut, and\r\nhanded us a piece of lighted wood. The dusky old woman was presented with\r\na cigar, which she forthwith lit, and proceeded to smoke with\r\nunmistakeable satisfaction. To our request for fresh cocoa-nuts with which\r\nto quench our thirst, the man, without moving from his place, shouted a\r\nfew words in the direction of the forest, which was speedily replied to,\r\nwhen some young girls came forth giggling and romping, who brought us what\r\nwe had asked for, fresh plucked from the slender cocoa-stem, as well as a\r\nsugar-cane, and some ginger (_Zingiber officinalis_); all these\r\nrefreshments were handed us amid much hilarity by a lot of daughters of\r\nEve, young, not the least shy, but by no means attractive, whom a present\r\nof two small mirrors in return sent away in a state of enthusiastic\r\ndelight. On our return to Dr. Cook's hut on the shore, several natives had\r\napproached who bartered mussels and fresh fruit for tobacco, which they\r\npreferred to everything, besides a number of young females, who were\r\nretailing, from small bags hung round their persons, the different animals\r\nthey had collected the same morning at ebb-tide among the coral reefs.\r\n\r\nOne of the white settlers offered his services as guide, to pilot us up\r\nthe Roankiddi river as far as a village of the natives about two miles\r\ninland, where the chief of the nation dwelt, and several American\r\nmissionaries had formed a settlement. Before reaching the main stream,\r\nwhich is about 100 feet wide and is densely wooded on either side, we had\r\nto pass various small branches and canals, which appeared to be\r\nartificially constructed, and wind about in a succession of extraordinary\r\nmeanderings beneath an elastic covering of conical mangrove roots. For\r\nabout a mile inwards there was nothing but dreary, swampy, unlovely\r\nmangrove forest, after which the vegetation on either shore began to\r\nassume an unusually variegated but thoroughly tropical appearance. Palms,\r\nbread-fruit trees, pandanus trees, papayas, caladias, Barringtonias, were\r\nthe chief representatives of this abounding forest flora. The animals on\r\nthis island seem to be less numerous and less varied; there are no large\r\nones at all. Of doves, as also of sand-pipers and parrots, we saw some\r\nvery beautiful species, of which the fowling-pieces of our sportsmen\r\nfurnished numerous specimens for our zoological collection. All along the\r\nbank of the river and around the hills lay scattered at will, under the\r\nshade of the most beautiful and abundant vegetation, the dwellings of the\r\nnatives. Near where the pretty Roankiddi falls into the sea, rises on the\r\nleft bank the handsome mission house built of wood, which serves the\r\nmissionaries for school, church, and residence in one. Close by is a stone\r\nbuilding, which serves as a larder. Unfortunately, the sole missionary,\r\nMr. Sturges of Pennsylvania, was absent on a tour of inspection, and only\r\nhis assistant (a native of the Sandwich Islands, who had received his\r\neducation in the States) was at home with his family. A third missionary,\r\nalso a native of the Sandwich Islands, lives at what is called\r\nFoul-weather Harbour, where he also occupies his time with meteorological\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThe mission, which has been in the island since 1851, is supported at\r\nconsiderable expense. A schooner, the property of the American Missionary\r\nSociety, keeps up regular communication with the neighbouring islands and\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, and supplies the missionaries with provisions and\r\nother necessaries. These industrious, energetic men have quite recently\r\nmade experiments in planting several sorts of vegetables, as also tobacco\r\nand sugar-cane, nearer their houses, in the hope, if successful, of\r\ninciting the natives to similar exertions. The great resources at the\r\ndisposal of the Protestant missionaries, and the circumstance that they\r\nattend to the temporal as well as the eternal weal of their dusky\r\nneophytes, exhausting their medical skill in illness, educating their\r\nchildren, ministering to their wants both by advice and co-operation, must\r\nbe regarded as the main causes of the rapid spread of Protestantism\r\nthroughout the races of the Pacific Ocean. We have seen missions, of which\r\nthe schools, places of worship, and dwelling-houses, constructed of iron,\r\nwere imported from the United States ready made, while the expenses of\r\nmaintenance were defrayed by an annual grant of 20,000 dollars. What a\r\ngratifying contrast to the wretched appliances with which Catholic oversea\r\nmissions are compelled to eke out a precarious existence!\r\n\r\nWe landed at a spot where the Roankiddi promised to be navigable for\r\nvessels of a better class than the hollowed-out canoes of the natives, and\r\nfor the remainder of the distance to the chief's residence we followed a\r\nfootpath through the forest. Close to the landing-place is a large,\r\nhall-like building, which is used as an assembly-room by the natives on\r\nthe occasion of their festivities. Around the interior of this are ranged\r\ncouches stuffed with straw for families of rank, not unlike berths round a\r\nship's cabin. The centre of the hall is set apart for slaves and servants,\r\nwho during these rude reunions are busily employed preparing food and\r\ndrink for strangers. As often as a meeting is deemed necessary,\r\ninvitations are sent off to the various chiefs requesting their\r\nco-operation. On very important occasions these are intoned through a\r\nconk. As soon as all are assembled the king lays the subject-matter of the\r\ndebate before them, when every one present is at liberty to express his\r\nopinion. Frequently these discussions become very animated, especially\r\nwhen the orators happen to have partaken too freely of Kawa, when only the\r\ninterference of the less excited chiefs can prevent the disputants from\r\ncoming to blows. When we saw it, there were in the hall of justice, as it\r\nmight be termed, a number of huge, lengthy, but elegant canoes, painted\r\nred, which gave it rather the appearance of a shed than a festive hall.\r\n\r\nThe footpath to the chief's residence led through a most beautiful\r\ntropical landscape. The estate of the Nannekin (as the natives designate a\r\nking in their own language) was laid out quite in the European fashion,\r\nand the entrance was indicated by a wooden gateway. The house itself, a\r\nlengthy oblong of wood and cane-work, with a roof of palm-leaves, and\r\nbuilt upon a sort of platform of two or three courses of stone, and\r\nfurnished in every part with numerous large apertures serving as windows,\r\npresented from without a very comfortable, even imposing appearance; but\r\nthe interior was bare, ill-equipped, and sadly out of order. A row of\r\nwooden columns, irregularly cut, and partially covered with gay-coloured\r\nstuffs, running parallel with the thin exterior walls, formed a narrow\r\npassage, a closer view of which was, however, shut off by cotton hangings\r\nstretching across. The clothes and other property of the family hung here\r\nat random, suspended from pegs and lines all round the wide hall, and in\r\nthe middle a hole had been excavated, which apparently was intended for a\r\nfire-place. Among the articles of furniture we specially noticed a large\r\niron chest, with iron clampings, and a very singular-looking loom, on\r\nwhich a fabric was being woven in variegated colours. The chief was not at\r\nhome, and had to be summoned, his timely absence affording an excellent\r\nopportunity for examining the environs of the palace a little more\r\nclosely. In immediate proximity were a number of bread-fruit trees\r\n(_Dong-dong_), the fruit of which forms the staple diet of the natives,\r\nand has long been prepared by them in quite a unique manner.\r\n\r\nThe bread-fruit, so soon as it is ripe, is stripped of its husk, and cut\r\ninto small pieces. These the natives place in pits dug for the purpose\r\nabout three feet deep, in which they are placed in layers carefully\r\nwrapped in banana leaves so as to prevent moisture reaching them. Thus\r\nprepared, the pits are filled up to within a few inches of the surface,\r\ncovered with leaves, and weighted with heavy stones so distributed as to\r\ndiffuse an equal pressure throughout. Thus each pit is both air and water\r\ntight. After a short time fermentation sets in, till the whole is\r\nconverted into a substance resembling cheese. The original idea of thus\r\nstoring the bread-fruit is said, according to tradition, to have been\r\nsuggested to the natives by a violent hurricane having at a remote period\r\nlevelled all the bread-fruit trees on the island, thus causing a great\r\nfamine. The fruit thus treated continues fit for consumption for years,\r\nand, despite its sour taste and nauseous odour when exhumed, it is\r\nregarded by the natives as a most palatable and nutritive dish, when well\r\nkneaded, placed between two banana leaves, and baked between two hot\r\nstones. Besides the bread-fruit, the principal articles of food in use\r\namong the natives are cocoa-nuts, sugar-cane, yams, pigeons, turtle, fish,\r\nand trepang, the sort of sea-cucumber of which we have already given a\r\ndescription, and which the natives eat in the raw state.\r\n\r\nThey also eat taro (_Caladium esculentum_), a beautiful bulbous-rooted\r\nplant of the _Aroidea_ tribe, with its broad elegant leaves, which,\r\ntogether with wild ginger and turmeric (which is used sometimes for food,\r\nsometimes for anointing the person, or dyeing their dresses) and the plant\r\nthey call Kawa (_Piper Methysticum_), grow in great profusion on the\r\nproperty of the Nannekin.\r\n\r\nAs in all the South Sea Islands, the juice of the Kawa is used in Puynipet\r\nfor distilling an intoxicating beverage, which indeed plays a conspicuous\r\npart in all their solemnities. But the mode of preparing it is somewhat\r\nbetter calculated to tempt the palate, since it is not, as elsewhere,\r\nfirst chewed by the women, but rubbed between two large stones, wetted,\r\nand then drawn off in cocoa-nut shells. The leading chief is entitled to\r\nthe first shells of the prepared Kawa, or, if he is not present, the chief\r\npriest, who mutters a few prayers over it ere drinking it.\r\n\r\nThe liquid, as thus procured from this species of pepper, is of a\r\nbrownish-yellow colour, somewhat like that of coffee into which milk has\r\nbeen poured. The taste is sweet and agreeable, producing a glow in the\r\nstomach, and induces a sort of intoxication, widely different however from\r\nthe form that alcoholic inebriations assume with us. Men in the habit of\r\ndrinking Kawa neither stagger about, nor speak thick and loud, when under\r\nits influence. A sort of shiver affects the whole frame, and their gait\r\nbecomes listless and slow, but they never lose consciousness. In its last\r\nstage, the person affected feels an extraordinary weakness in all his\r\njoints; headache and an irresistible inclination to go to sleep supervene,\r\nand a state of most complete repose becomes an absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nThe custom of Kawa drinking is diffused over the whole of the islands of\r\nthe Pacific. It even appears to have become a necessary of life among the\r\nnatives of Polynesia, just as betel-chewing and palm-wine are to the\r\nMalays and Hindoos, opium-smoking and samchoo to the Chinese, chicha to\r\nthe Mexican races, and coca to the South American Indians.\r\n\r\nIn former times, on certain of the islands, the chiefs had regular\r\nwatchers, whose duty it was to guard their monarchs from being disturbed\r\nwhen thus reposing. A dog which dared to bark, a cock that was venturesome\r\nenough to crow, were forthwith put to death. The too liberal or\r\nlong-continued indulgence in Kawa seems to generate a peculiar cuticular\r\ndisease. Inveterate Kawa drinkers seem haggard or melancholy, their eyes\r\nare sunk, their teeth of a bright yellow, their skin dry and chopped, and\r\nthe whole body is covered with boils; but those in whom such sores heal up\r\nagain, point with pride to the cicatrices that mark where they occurred.\r\nThe more of these scars a Kawa drinker can show, the higher is his\r\ncharacter. Besides producing unconsciousness, Kawa also induces\r\nexceedingly erotic dreams.\r\n\r\nAccording to the information which the white settlers gave us respecting\r\nthe method of cultivation of the soil of Puynipet and its climate, it\r\nseems that sugar-cane, coffee, cotton, rice, tobacco, &c., would be\r\ncertain to succeed. Sugar-cane is found even now in the wild state; and to\r\na certain extent it forms an article of food of the natives, who suck the\r\njuice.\r\n\r\nThe chief of Roankiddi is a handsome young man of lofty stature, strong\r\nframe, of dark brown almost bronze skin, and agreeable, winning\r\nexpression. With the exception of the usual apron of palm-leaves, and a\r\nbright red belt, he was naked, and wore a green circlet on his fine,\r\nlustrous black hair, and a piece of sugar-cane in his right hand. His arms\r\nand legs were very neatly tattooed. He seemed quite to understand the use\r\nof a red Turkish fez with blue tassel, which we presented to him, and took\r\nfrom his head its own exceedingly picturesque covering. Having been\r\napprized of the friendly nature of our visit, he begged us to enter his\r\nhouse, which was not so easy a process as it seems, since the only access\r\nwas by one of the windows, about three feet from the ground. The Nannekin,\r\nhowever, set us the example, and we followed. He first invited us to sit\r\nupon European chairs, and ordered his pretty young wife to fetch us\r\ncocoa-nut milk. It was the first time we had ever tasted this drink of the\r\nnatural man in the goblet of civilization! How differently did this\r\ninvaluable drink taste, when quaffed from the fresh green shell, than in\r\nthe artificial vessel of human manufacture! The natives of Puynipet did\r\nnot, like those of Nicobar, show their dexterity in opening the young\r\ncocoa-nut by means of a slash. Here the husk is peeled off, and an opening\r\nbored with much trouble till the fluid contents gush out--a process so\r\ntedious, and manifesting so little ingenuity, that one would rather expect\r\nit to be adopted by a European, who for the first time in his life was\r\nopening a cocoa-nut, than from a child of the tropics. After the queen had\r\npresented with her dainty little hands the cocoa-nut drink to the foreign\r\nguests, she squatted herself smiling and laughing on the earth beside the\r\nmonarch, occasionally hiding herself with much natural grace behind her\r\nyouthful husband, when she could not restrain a burst of mirth at the\r\ninterest with which we seemed to regard many of the objects in her simple\r\nhousehold. Nothing surprised her more than that we should attach such\r\nvalue to some baskets, plaited work, boxes, &c., as to be willing to\r\nexchange articles of European make for them. Like all the other females\r\nwe saw, the young queen wore nothing but a piece of yellow linen (_liku_),\r\nabout five feet long, round her loins, which reached to her knees, and was\r\nattached by one extremity to the haunch. Her splendid black hair was\r\nadorned with a chaplet of yellow flowers, and her body, smeared with\r\ncocoa-nut oil, was plentifully besprinkled with turmeric (called by the\r\nnatives _Kitschi-neang_). Her legs and forearms were beautifully tattooed.\r\n\r\nThe gown, or rather apron, worn by the men is made of the fresh leaves of\r\nthe cocoa-palm, which, bleached and cut into narrow strips, are fastened\r\nat the upper end with a string, and then adorned with numerous flaps of\r\nred cloth. This gown stretches from the hips to about the knees, and is\r\nabout two feet long. To be in the fashion at Puynipet, a dandy must wear\r\nat least six of these round his body! The ladies of the island stain white\r\ncalico with turmeric, yellow being apparently the favourite colour of the\r\ncountry. A bright-coloured light handkerchief usually covers the upper\r\npart of the body, and they adorn their long beautiful black tresses with\r\nthe delicate flowers of the cocoa-palm. On high days the ladies wear red\r\nclothes hemmed with white calico. Such of the natives, however, as are\r\nconverted to Christianity, appear in clothes made after the European\r\nfashion, although many a part of dress would still have to be remedied,\r\nere a native of Puynipet or his better half would be presentable in a\r\nsaloon.\r\n\r\nMen and women alike are tattooed from the loins to the ancles, and from\r\nthe elbows to the wrist. This curious practice is performed on both sexes\r\nat from ten to twelve years of age by old women, with whom it is a regular\r\nprofession. The blue colouring matter used is obtained from the abundant\r\nnut-like fruit of the _Aleurites triloba_, which they heat on the fire,\r\nand then peel off the hard crust which forms upon it. The operation is\r\nperformed with the sharp point of a species of pine, or with a pointed\r\ninstrument[193] made from fish-bone, which is placed upon the skin, when\r\nit is driven in with a slight blow, till the whole design comes out upon\r\nthe body. Besides the turmeric already mentioned, we saw but one colouring\r\nstuff, dyeing red, which seemed to be obtained from _Bixa Orellana_, and\r\nis used by the natives to paint their canoes with.\r\n\r\nMany of the natives are subject to a very disgusting scaly eruption of the\r\nskin (_Ichthyosis_), but do not seem to feel any discomfort from it. Some\r\ntravellers ascribe this to the immoderate use as an article of diet of raw\r\nuncooked fish. It is singular that this malady is found on all the islands\r\nnear the equator, and was also found by Captain Cheyne among the Pellew\r\nIslanders. That shrewd observer once had on board for four months a native\r\nof Puynipet as servant, whose whole body was covered with this eruption,\r\nbut who speedily lost every trace of it as soon as his chief diet was salt\r\nmeat and vegetables. Beside this cuticular malady, the natives are\r\ngreatly afflicted with scurvy and intermittent fever. Most of their\r\ninfants too suffer from Yaws[194] (_Framboesia_), a disgusting eruption,\r\ncalled by the natives \"_Keutsch_,\" which, however, disappears when the\r\nchild has attained about its third or fourth year. The marks left by this\r\nmalady when cicatrized might easily be mistaken for those of inoculation.\r\n\r\nThe Nannekin, although the king of his tribe, nevertheless seemed on the\r\nwhole to exercise but little influence over his subjects. Thus, for\r\nexample, we were eye-witnesses of how he vainly attempted to induce two\r\nnative boys to carry our bananas as far as our place of disembarkation. On\r\nthe other hand, in all that concerned trading with foreigners he seemed to\r\nbe thoroughly alive to his own interest. One native who was driving a\r\nbargain with us for something, was informed forthwith of the value which\r\nthe Nannekin assigned to it.\r\n\r\nMoney is as yet but little used at Puynipet as a medium of exchange, only\r\nthe whites resident there and the chiefs take a few English and United\r\nStates coins; and many a native would generally not part for a silver\r\ndollar from an object which he will readily give for a piece of chewing\r\ntobacco or a common knife. The most useful articles for barter are pieces\r\nof bright-coloured calico, red shirts, hatchets, knives, axes, straight\r\nswords, muskets, ammunition, biscuit, old clothes, and tobacco.[195]\r\n\r\nOf the latter article American Cavendish or negro-head in longish pieces\r\nis the most in repute. The Puynipetanese have no special fondness for\r\ncigars, nor do they use pipes, but only chew passionately tobacco. As they\r\nare unacquainted with the use of the Betel, their teeth are universally\r\nbeautiful, and of a brilliant white.\r\n\r\nThere are on the island five tribes, wholly independent of each\r\nother,--the Roankiddi, the Metelemia, the Not, the Tchokoits, and the\r\nAwnak, none, however, numbering much above 1500 souls, the most numerous\r\nand important being the Roankiddi.\r\n\r\nEach king, we are told, has a minister whose power almost rivals his own.\r\nNext in rank to the minister are the nobles, who bear the following\r\nstrange-sounding titles: Talk, Washy, Nane-by, Noatch, Shoe-Shabut, and\r\nGroen-wani; after these come such as are not of noble birth, but have\r\nearned them through illustrious deeds, and have been rewarded with\r\nestates. On the death of the king he is succeeded by whichever of his\r\nnobles has the title of Talk, the others rising one grade. The monarch\r\nhas the right of freely disposing of his property. As a rule he leaves it\r\nto his sons, but if he have none he usually bequeaths it to the next\r\nsovereign. Between the monarch and his courtiers some quaint patriarchal\r\ncustoms prevail. Thus the first ripe bread-fruit is brought to the king.\r\nWhenever a chief uses a new turtle or fish net, the prey during a certain\r\nnumber of days is sent to the king. Another mark of the respect paid to\r\nthe king, as also by all ranks to their superiors, is to be found in the\r\ncustom for a native who meets another of higher rank in a canoe,--he\r\ncowers down in his own boat till the other has passed by, the two canoes\r\napproaching on the side opposite the outrigger, so that the person of\r\nsuperior condition may, if he see fit, satisfy himself of the identity of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe Awnaks and Tchokoits had, at the period of our visit, been at war with\r\neach other for six months, and it is significant of the ferocity and\r\ncourage of both parties, that not a single combatant had thus far been\r\nwounded on either side! Their weapons are chiefly spears of hard wood, six\r\nfeet long, the barb, instead of iron, being made of fish-bones, thorns, or\r\nground mussel-shells, which they throw with great dexterity; also\r\nhatchets, long knives, and old muskets, obtained from the whale-fishers in\r\nreturn for yams and tortoise-shell. At present there are about 1500\r\nmuskets in all on the island, and each native possesses at least one, some\r\nof the chiefs having as many as three, besides ample ammunition. Singular\r\nto say, these formidable auxiliaries are rarely called into play in any\r\nof their wars, the fatal effect of fire-arms having contributed not a\r\nlittle to the promotion of harmony and peace between the various tribes!\r\nTheir warriors are selected from among the most powerful men of the tribe,\r\nand as a rule they behave with much consideration to the women and\r\nchildren, whom they almost always spare. When either party sues for peace,\r\na neutral party is sent to the monarch of the opposite tribe with a few\r\nKawa roots. If these are accepted, the struggle is considered over, and a\r\nsuccession of friendly visits are thereupon exchanged between the chiefs\r\nof the two tribes, which are usually followed up by festivities and much\r\nconsumption of Kawa.\r\n\r\nAs to the narratives of most earlier travellers that the island is\r\ninhabited by two entirely distinct races, the one yellow the other black,\r\nwe could neither see nor hear of anything which would confirm such a\r\nstatement. It seemed more probable that the diversity of skin and hair\r\namong the various tribes was exclusively caused by a variety of crosses,\r\nwhich are still frequent, and in former times must have been still more\r\nprevalent. The present population consists of whites, negroes, and\r\nyellow-coloured aborigines, who, as speaking a dialect allied to that of\r\nPolynesia, seem to belong to the Malay-Polynesian _stirps_. The present\r\nwhite settlers are English and North Americans; formerly they were chiefly\r\nSpanish and Portuguese who traded with the natives. Negro slaves and free\r\nblacks have also occasionally visited the island, or been left there for\r\ngood and all. These considerations alone suffice to explain certain\r\nappearances among the natives, such as brown or yellow skins, with crisp\r\nwoolly hair, and very full lips, without any more marked characteristics\r\nof the Ethiopian race. We noticed one native with woolly hair of a reddish\r\nhue, but otherwise of strongly-marked Malay features, and on inquiring\r\ninto his ancestry, were informed in reply that his father was a Portuguese\r\n(negro understood), and his mother a native.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Doctor Cook, the Scotchman already mentioned, of whose\r\nunion with a native woman of the island there was issue a handsome\r\nwell-shaped _mestiza_ of a light yellow colour, strongly recalling the\r\nstately, elegant quadroons of New Orleans and St. Domingo, had\r\nintermarried with a full-blooded negro of the district of Columbia, U. S.,\r\nfrom which resulted a new and entirely dissimilar admixture. Their\r\nchildren had the face of the mother, with the woolly head of the father.\r\n\r\nAt all events it may be laid down with some degree of certainty, that the\r\naboriginal races, especially those inhabiting the Caroline Archipelago,\r\nare not of the Pelagian Mongols, nor are they an offshoot of the Mongolian\r\nrace of the Asiatic continent, as Lesson maintained; also that Puynipet\r\nhas not been peopled by the Papuan negroes; that the woolly crisp hair of\r\nso many of its inhabitants is mainly explained by the intimacy between the\r\nblack crews of the whalers (it being well known that a large proportion of\r\nthe crews of the American whalers are negroes), some 50 or 60 of which\r\nvisit the island every year, and often remain for several weeks taking in\r\nprovisions and other stores.\r\n\r\nPuynipet has been for some years past the chief rendezvous of the whalers\r\nin the Caroline Archipelago, because it is of all the islands the most\r\naccessible, has the best and safest harbours, and because fuel and water\r\nare procurable thence in unlimited quantities.\r\n\r\nThe complexion of the natives is of a clear copper hue, and the average\r\nheight of the males is 5 feet 8 in.; the women are much smaller than the\r\nmen, with delicate features and flexible forms. The sons of the chiefs are\r\nusually well formed, and lighter in colour than the majority of the\r\npopulation, the consequence of their being less exposed to the weather,\r\nand in any part of the world would pass for elegant men. The nose is\r\narched, the mouth wide with full lips and dazzling teeth. The flap of the\r\near is bored in both sexes, but is rarely much enlarged by artificial\r\nmeans. Both men and women have beautiful black hair, which they take great\r\ncare of.\r\n\r\nThe men have neither beard nor mustachios. They eradicate the hair so soon\r\nas it makes its appearance on the cheeks by means of mussel-shells, or two\r\nlittle pieces of tortoise-shell sharpened. The women are usually pretty,\r\nbut as the girls marry very young they soon lose the freshness of youth.\r\nTheir complexion is much fairer than that of the men. The cause of this is\r\nto be found in their wearing a sort of upper robe of calico; a large\r\npiece of stuff with a hole in the centre through which to put the head,\r\nwhich thus protects their bodies somewhat from the direct rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe natives are said to be very temperate and methodical in their habits\r\nof life. They rise at daybreak, bathe in the river, take a little\r\nvegetable food, anoint their bodies with cocoa-nut oil, after which they\r\nsprinkle themselves plentifully with powdered turmeric. This done, they\r\naddress themselves to some simple avocation, which they prosecute till\r\nnoon, when they once more withdraw to their huts, bathe, and partake of\r\nanother equally frugal repast. The rest of the day is spent in amusements\r\nand mutual visiting. Towards sunset they take a third meal, and as they\r\nhave neither torches nor artificial light of any sort, they usually retire\r\nearly to rest, unless fishing or dancing by moonlight.\r\n\r\nMuch respect and consideration is paid to the weaker sex throughout the\r\nisland, they not being put to any work which does not come within their\r\nregular sphere of duty. All outdoor work is done by the men, who build the\r\nhuts and canoes, plant yams and Kawa, fish, transport the food from the\r\nplantation to the house, and even cook it.\r\n\r\nThe women are chiefly occupied within-doors, in fishing, or cleaning the\r\nvegetables, most of their time being taken up with preparing head-dresses,\r\nweaving girdles, sewing together palm or pandanus leaves for clothes,\r\nplaiting elegant baskets, and looking after the house and children.\r\n\r\nNever at any time patterns of virtue and chastity, the importation of\r\nEuropean trinkets and luxuries of all sorts has greatly increased the\r\nspread of immorality among the native women, who are actuated by an\r\ninsatiate, irresistible craving to possess articles of European\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nWhen a native wishes to marry, he makes a present to the father of the\r\ngirl he wishes to marry; if not returned, it is understood his addresses\r\nare accepted. Thereupon invitations are issued to a merry-making, with\r\nfeast, and dance, and revel, after which the bridegroom conducts his bride\r\nto his dwelling. When she dies the widower marries her sister, the brother\r\nin like manner being required to marry his widowed sister-in-law in the\r\ncase of the death of the husband, even though he may happen to be already\r\nmarried. Under certain circumstances a man is at liberty to divorce his\r\nwife and take another; a woman, on the other hand, enjoys no such\r\nprivilege, unless she happen to be of higher rank. The chiefs usually have\r\nseveral wives, polygamy, as among the Mormons, being only limited by the\r\nmeans of providing subsistence. The women are of an unusually gossiping,\r\ntalkative turn, they are quite incapable of keeping their own secrets, and\r\nmany a delinquency is generally known at the very moment of its\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nThe funeral ceremonies seem to have undergone some modification since the\r\nnatives began to have intercourse with Europeans. In former times the dead\r\nwere enveloped in straw mats, and kept for a considerable time in the\r\nhuts: through the influence of the missionaries, apparently, they have\r\nadopted the European custom of interring their dead in certain special\r\nplaces. On the death of a chief or any exalted person, the female\r\nrelatives of the deceased assemble to mourn for a specific period, and\r\nbetray their sorrow by loud sobs and lamentations by day and dances by\r\nnight. The connections of the deceased cut off their hair as a mark of\r\ntheir sorrow. All the goods and clothes of the defunct are carried away by\r\nwhoever is nearest or first possesses himself of them, and this custom is\r\nso universal that objects thus obtained are thenceforth considered as\r\nlawful property.\r\n\r\nThe natives usually pray to the spirits of their departed chiefs, whom\r\nthey implore to grant them success in fishing, rich harvests in\r\nbread-fruit and yams, the arrival of numerous foreign ships with beautiful\r\narticles for barter, and a variety of similar matters. The priests of\r\ntheir idols profess to be able to read the future, and the natives place\r\nthe most implicit confidence in these predictions. They believe that the\r\npriest is inspired with the spirit of a deceased chief, and that every\r\nword they utter when in this excited state is dictated by the departed.\r\nWhen any of these prophecies fail, as is often enough the case, the\r\ncunning priest pretends that another more powerful spirit has interfered,\r\nand forcibly prevented the accomplishment of what they had foretold.\r\n\r\nThe religion of this primitive people is very simple. They have neither\r\nidols nor temple, and although they believe in a future state after death,\r\nthey seem to have no religious customs or festivals of any sort. Their\r\nnotion of a future state is under such circumstances exceedingly\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nTheir abode after death they believe to be surrounded by a colossal wall\r\namid a fathomless abyss, in fact a sort of fortress. The only portal into\r\nthis Elysian abode is guarded by an old woman, whose duty it is to hurl\r\nback into the yawning deep the shadows of the departed, who are compelled\r\nto spring upwards from the abyss. Such of the shadows as succeed in\r\neluding the evil spirit and effecting an entrance are for ever happy; on\r\nthe other hand, those whom the malicious female demon succeeds in\r\nprecipitating into the abyss sink into the region of endless woe and\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nThe native festivals, as a rule, take precedence of every other business,\r\nno matter how pressing. Every year the king visits the various villages\r\nand settlements of those of his tribe, at which period the chief\r\nfestivities take place, the chiefs vieing with each other in entertaining\r\nhim. Enormous quantities of yam and bread-fruit are on such occasions\r\ncooked two days previous, and Kawa is drunk to excess.\r\n\r\nTheir dances are far from unbecoming, and are quite free from those\r\nlascivious gestures which are so often seen at the festivals of the other\r\ninhabitants of the South Sea. The dancers are usually unmarried lads and\r\ngirls, who stand opposite each other in long rows. While keeping time with\r\ntheir feet to the music, they accompany the dance with graceful motions of\r\nthe arms and upper part of the body. Occasionally they throw their arms\r\nout, snap their fingers, and then clap the hands together. Every movement\r\nis performed with extraordinary precision, and at the same moment by all\r\nthe dancers. Their sole musical instrument is a small flute made of\r\nbamboo-cane, the notes of which they draw forth by inserting one end in\r\nthe nostril and blowing gently, while their hands are busy fingering the\r\nholes in the usual way.\r\n\r\nTheir drum is a piece of hollowed-out wood with the skin of a shark\r\nstretched over it, of the shape of a sand-glass. This is struck with the\r\nfingers of the right hand, the instrument being hung on the left side. The\r\nsound somewhat resembles the Tom-tom of the Hindoos. The drummer sits\r\ncross-legged on the ground, and accompanies the beat of the drum with\r\napposite words.\r\n\r\nAs to the monumental ruins of the interior of Puynipet which have never\r\nyet been visited and described by scientific travellers, we were informed\r\nthat they consisted of nothing more than a large number of colossal\r\nrough-hewn blocks of basalt in the heart of the forest, near Metelenia\r\nharbour. The simplicity of the native, in the absence of all means of\r\naccounting for them naturally, sees in these the grand forms of the\r\nspirits of departed chiefs. Experienced travellers, on the other hand, are\r\nof opinion that in this primeval forest, where now only rocky debris lie\r\nscattered about, there once stood strong fortifications, such as indeed no\r\nsavage people could have erected, and that the character of the ruins\r\nevidences a high state of civilization in those who erected them. Some of\r\nthe blocks are 8 or 10 feet long, hexagonal, and must evidently have been\r\nbrought from some other country, since, with the exception of these, there\r\nare no other stones of a similar description found in any part of the\r\nisland. Streets are laid out at various points, and the whole settlement\r\nseems to have consisted of a range of strongly fortified dwellings.[196]\r\n\r\nThese columns and blocks, however, possess a special interest not merely\r\nin the history of civilization, but of geology, as a part is at present\r\nunder water, and can only be reached in canoes, a difficulty which cannot\r\nhave been in existence at the period of their erection. What once were\r\nstreets are now passages for canoes, and were the walls, built of massive\r\nbasalt blocks, to be pulled up, the water would obtain access to the\r\ninclosed space. This has induced later geologists to refer this phenomenon\r\nto a sinking of the entire group, so that Puynipet is perhaps the only\r\nspot on the earth where Darwin's ingenious theory of the construction of\r\nperpendicular reefs and atolls being the result of a sinking of the soil\r\non which the coral-animal had begun to erect his edifice, receives\r\nconfirmation from the existence of the remains of man's handiwork within\r\nthe historic period.\r\n\r\nAs even the \"oldest inhabitants\" could give us not the slightest\r\ninformation as to these ruins, and their origin and history are plunged\r\nin the utmost obscurity, it seems not improbable that these stone masses\r\nwere once the fortified retreat of pirates, and were built by Spanish\r\ncorsairs 200 or 300 years back. This hypothesis receives confirmation in\r\nthe fact that in 1838 or 1840, a small brass cannon was found on a hill in\r\nthe interior, which was brought home as a curiosity by H.M.S. _Larne_.\r\nOccasionally, too, at various parts of the island clearings are found,\r\nsome of which are several acres in extent. In one of these, still in\r\nexistence near the harbour of Roankiddi, the traveller is shown an\r\nartificial mound of about 20 feet wide, 8 feet high, and a quarter of a\r\nmile long, which has obviously been thrown up as a defence, or else has\r\nbeen the place of interment for such as have fallen in a severe contest.\r\n\r\nThis conjecture adopted, it follows that the present population is of\r\nquite recent introduction, and the rumour of a black race inhabiting the\r\ninterior must necessarily be treated as a myth.\r\n\r\nWhile we were asking questions and getting up information, evening was\r\nbeginning to draw on, and we could not remain longer on the island, as it\r\nwas necessary to return on ship-board before nightfall, the frigate having\r\nmeanwhile been kept cruising under easy sail, about three or four miles\r\noff the island. Another reason for our immediate departure was to be found\r\nin our narrow flat-bottomed craft, which in any sort of sea-way would have\r\nsome difficulty in escaping swamping. Had the wind during our return\r\nvoyage freshened ever so little, we should have found ourselves in a\r\nserious dilemma. Numbers of herons, white, black, and mottled, were\r\nfishing in the shallow water along the edge of the reefs, the sea-raven\r\nflew in vast flights among the lagoons, while high overhead the graceful\r\nfrigate-bird swept along, every now and then darting rapidly down to\r\nsecure his booty.\r\n\r\nOne of the whites whom we employed as our guide in the island, accompanied\r\nus on board, and asked as his reward some tobacco and clothes, with which\r\nhe departed much satisfied. In him, too, we observed a marked and quite\r\npeculiar shyness, especially when on board the frigate. He seemed as\r\nthough he dreaded some avenging hand. His glance was timid, his gait and\r\nmotions betrayed a sense of insecurity, and he might have readily been\r\nmistaken for some repentant sinner, who in consequence of some evil deed\r\nhad fled from civilized society and sought out this distant asylum, where\r\nhe had scarcely to fear any other persecution than that of his own\r\nconscience! Hardly any spot, indeed, can be named more suitable for thus\r\nexpiating crime than this remote island, where the white man, face to face\r\nwith nature in a new and unwonted aspect, and at the mercy of a savage\r\npeople, often deprived for months of the consolations and support of\r\ncivilization, finds in his solitude ample opportunity to reflect upon the\r\nenormity of his guilt, and to mourn over his own evil fortune.\r\n\r\nAs the west wind, which still blew, effectually prevented the frigate\r\nfrom entering the harbour of Roankiddi, and there was no reason to hope\r\nfor any speedy change, our original intention of spending several days\r\nthere was abandoned, and the same evening we resumed our course for\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nAs our brief stay of barely five hours on the island of Puynipet\r\nnecessarily led to our observations and remarks being of the most\r\nsuperficial nature, whereas the island has of late years begun to acquire\r\nan unusual importance both in a maritime and a commercial sense, we must\r\ncontent ourselves with referring the reader for a more detailed account to\r\nCaptain Cheyne's admirable and comprehensive account of the island.\r\n\r\n\"The Ant Islands (called also Fraser's Islands) lie in a S.W. direction\r\nfrom the harbour of Roankiddi, from which they are about 12 nautical miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n\"They consist of a group of low coral islets covered with cocoa-palms and\r\nbread-fruit trees, and surrounded by a coral reef, which makes a lagoon in\r\nthe centre. Between the two longer islands at the east end of the group\r\nthere is a channel. The entire group from N.W. to S.E. measures seven\r\nmiles in width, is only inhabited from May to September, during the period\r\nwhen the cuttle-fish are caught, and is the property of the chief of the\r\nRoankiddi tribe. However the islands are frequented at all seasons by the\r\nnatives of Puynipet, who procure here cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit. The most\r\nnorth-easterly point lies in 6 deg. 42' N., 158 deg. 3' E.\r\n\r\n\"Next the Ant Island is Pakeen, the sole adjoining island. It lies about\r\n22 miles W. of Tschokoits, its central point lying in 7 deg. 10' N. and 157 deg.\r\n43' E. It consists of five small coral islets, completely inclosed in a\r\nreef, which forms an inaccessible lagoon in the interior.\r\n\r\n\"The entire group is about five miles in length from west to east, and\r\nfrom north to south three miles in width. The islands are very low, but\r\nproduce an enormous quantity of cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit, while the\r\nlagoon abounds with excellent fish. The westernmost island is inhabited by\r\nabout thirty persons in all, mainly of the family and attendants of the\r\nChief of Puynipet, who claims proprietorship of the whole group. This\r\nscanty population is chiefly engaged in the construction of mats and\r\ncanoe-sails made of the leaves of the _pandanus_. In fine weather the\r\ndenizens of Pakeen are fond of running over to Puynipet to exchange their\r\nown products for tobacco and other foreign articles.\r\n\r\n\"What are marked on the charts as Bottomless Group and St. Augustine's\r\nIslands have no existence. Pakeen and Ant's Islands are the same groups\r\nadjoining each other to the westward of Puynipet.\"\r\n\r\nOur progress now began to be very slow, and the equatorial zones with\r\ntheir vexatious calms, and variable light breezes alternating with violent\r\nsqualls, became a sore trial for our patience. An unusual and most\r\noppressive heat, from which we vainly sought shelter; tropical rains,\r\nwhich often fell in unbroken torrents for hours at a time, and obscured\r\nthe daylight with clouds almost as suddenly at times as though there were\r\nan eclipse; a long heavy swell, which knocked the good ship about with an\r\nunceasing and most disagreeable motion, without nevertheless our being\r\nable to advance one single mile in the twenty-four hours; the depressing\r\nmonotonous flapping and filling of the sails, which, with the rolling and\r\npitching of the ship, now bellied out and then fell idly back against the\r\nmasts and yards, straining the rigging and cordage, and keeping a constant\r\nindescribable but most irritating noise--such is a faint sketch of the\r\nmiseries of voyagers caught by an equatorial calm in a sailing vessel! How\r\none longs for a good hearty storm, if only to drive us out of this truly\r\ndismal plight! How in the monotony of such an existence does a quite\r\ninsignificant circumstance at once assume the proportions of an important\r\nevent! The most trifling incident on board, the most imperceptible object\r\nwhich becomes visible in either atmosphere or water, attracts universal\r\nattention, and gives rise to discussions by the hour. One day some one\r\nperceived a dark object floating in the distance; when the frigate got\r\nnear this proved to be the trunk of a tree, almost 100 feet long, and\r\nthough at best we could only have used it as firewood, a boat was\r\nforthwith manned and dispatched to tow it alongside. A few black\r\nAlbatrosses suffered themselves to be hauled contentedly along upon the\r\nfloating trunk, somewhat astonishing us by their being found so near the\r\nequator. Only by dint of considerable exertion was the huge unwieldy\r\npiece of wood brought on board, when the zoologists got a famous lesson in\r\nconchology, from the shell-fish that had fastened on it, and the sailors\r\nchuckled with delight at finding some occupation in cutting up the\r\nvegetable colossus into sizeable pieces.\r\n\r\nAt 6.30 P.M. on the 29th Sept., we crossed the equator for the sixth time\r\nin 161 deg. 57' E., and in the Southern hemisphere found we still had to\r\ncontend with calms and contrary winds.\r\n\r\n             \"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,\r\n              Crept in this petty pace from day to day,\"\r\n\r\nwithout our making any perceptible progress. When we had reached 4 deg. 15'\r\nS., and 160 deg. 24' E., a circumstance occurred to break the uniformity of\r\nour existence, as according to the charts we were using of the\r\nHydrographic Institute of England for the year 1856,[197] we must have\r\nbeen quite close to some coral reefs, known as Simpson's Island. But\r\nalthough by our observations, after due allowance made for currents, we\r\nwere, about 4 P.M. of the 5th October, off the N.W. extremity of the\r\nislands, there was no land of any sort visible on either side even from\r\nthe royals, and we accordingly had to conjecture that Captain Simpson,\r\nafter whom these islands were named, must have sighted one of the Le Maire\r\nor Tasman group, which lie 40 miles further to the west and 10 miles\r\nfurther to the north, and had, owing to false reckoning, imagined to have\r\ndiscovered a new cluster; for on the following day at 6 P.M., when by our\r\ncourse, which was south-easterly, the island ought to have lain W.N.W. ten\r\nmiles distant, not a vestige of land could be descried from the deck, nor\r\neven from the mast-head, so that we felt positive the Simpson group were\r\nneither at the spot laid in the general chart of the English Admiralty,\r\nnor within ten miles of it in either an easterly or westerly\r\ndirection.[198]\r\n\r\nA few days after this interlude, an incident of a very peculiar character\r\ntook place, which excited universal attention, and more especially greatly\r\nexercised the souls of the superstitious. The occasion was nothing less\r\nthan a dread whisper that there was a ghost on board. From time to time,\r\nin fact, dull rumbling sounds were said to be audible, which some\r\nprofessed to hear above them, others below, some in the fore part of the\r\nship, others aft. It was a noise like the roll of thunder, or of\r\ncannon-balls that had got loose. The shot-racks were carefully examined,\r\nbut everything there appeared to be in its usual order. The sound was\r\nrepeated the following days, when there was hanging over us a sky as black\r\nand murky, accompanied by heavy pelts of rain, as though all the clouds\r\nof heaven were lavishing their contents upon us. All on board indulged in\r\nevery possible hypothesis that could explain these sounds, and exhausted\r\nthemselves in conjectures. Some maintained that one of the volcanoes of\r\nthe Solomon group, in the vicinity of which we were at the time, was in a\r\nstate of activity, and was the cause of these sub-marine thunders; but the\r\nsailors, sailor-like, insisted it was ghosts playing pranks, and the\r\nattendants refused any longer to remain in the cock-pit, alleging it was\r\nhaunted! However, when a second examination was made of the shot-racks, it\r\nwas found that no fewer than eighty thirty-pound iron shots had broken\r\nthrough the wooden bulk-head of the ordnance room, whence they had made\r\ntheir way into the bread-depot, as it was called, and on its metal floor\r\nhad produced the resonance peculiar to the impact of metal against metal.\r\nThe mystery was at once solved in the most natural manner, and the\r\n\"each-particular-hair-on-end\" ghost stories which during the last few days\r\nhad been flying from mouth to mouth, forthwith dropped. Thus might many a\r\n\"marvel\" prove to be the result of some very ordinary cause, if people\r\nwould but take the trouble to examine its natural causes, instead of\r\nascribing everything which they cannot understand or explain to some\r\nsupernatural influence.\r\n\r\nAt noon of the 7th October, in 6 deg. 37' S., 161 deg. 8' E., we were, according\r\nto chart, 12 miles distant from Bradley's Reef. But although both seamen\r\nand midshipmen were stationed at the mast-heads, in order the more\r\nreadily to make it out with the advantage of such an elevation, there was\r\nnot the slightest trace perceptible of rocks or shoals, and we sailed\r\nwithout obstruction over the very spot at which, according to the English\r\ncharts, Bradley's Reef rises from the waves. This reef was discovered by\r\nCaptain Hunter in May, 1791, two days after he had passed Stewart's Island\r\n(Sikayana), and is doubly dangerous in a climate where the sea rarely runs\r\nso high as to make it easily observed by the surf breaking over it.\r\nAccording to our observations, collated with those of Captain Cheyne,\r\nBradley's Reef must lie in about 160 deg. 48' E.[199]\r\n\r\nThe same day about 7 P.M., when we were about 120 miles distant from the\r\nN.W. part of the Solomon group, there suddenly and altogether unexpectedly\r\nblazed forth in the western sky an immense and most brilliant comet, with\r\na yellow, rather bright nucleus, and an enormous tail, sweeping over some\r\n15 deg. or 20 deg. It was about 8 deg. or 10 deg. above the horizon when we observed it.\r\n\r\nThis rare phenomenon, during the fourteen days it continued visible,\r\npresented a most excellent opportunity for astronomical observations. Upon\r\nthe sailors, usually so superstitious, this splendid celestial visitor\r\nmade a much less profound impression than we had anticipated. But few were\r\napprehensive that the end of the world was at hand, while the majority\r\nseemed quietly to indulge the pleasing anticipation that the wine of the\r\npresent year would be good and plentiful.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 8th of October, we sighted the Solomon Islands. Some reefs\r\nwhich were said to lie a little to the north, adjoining Ontong-Java, we\r\nlooked for in vain in the positions assigned them on the charts. On the\r\nother hand we could see the lofty, forest-covered Carteret Island directly\r\nbefore us. Gower Island lay nearly due west, about four miles distant.\r\nThis flat low island, which also is not quite accurately laid down on the\r\nEnglish chart, appears to be about eight miles long, the highest point of\r\nits ridge not exceeding 180 feet above the sea. Its S.E. and N.W. points,\r\nupon which beats a furious surf, extend a full half mile into the sea. We\r\ncould nowhere perceive any huts of natives. Nevertheless it is highly\r\nprobable, if the island is inhabited at all, that the population would\r\nhave settled on the W. side, which is more sheltered against wind and\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nFrom the hills on Carteret Island smoke was issuing at different points,\r\nbut the natives did not put off in their boats, although on the afternoon\r\nof 8th October the frigate was becalmed off the land. When it was found\r\nthat in consequence of the violence of the S.E. winds, which alternated\r\nwith calms and N.E. squalls accompanied by rain, it would be impossible\r\nfor us to pass through \"Indispensable Straits,\" fringed as they are with\r\ncoral reefs, it was resolved to range along the N.E. side of the entire\r\nchain of islands, so as to fetch the open passage between San Christoval\r\n(the most south-easterly of the Solomon Islands) and the Nitendi group. We\r\nthus had to beat with much difficulty against a S.E. wind and a strong\r\ncurrent, so that we barely made 15 miles a day.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th October, towards evening, we found ourselves about opposite\r\nthe large mountainous island of Malayta. This island presents fine\r\nrichly-wooded mountain scenery, but without any traces of volcanic\r\ncontours. The natives do not appear to dwell near the shore, but among the\r\nhills we could observe cleared spots and huts. Curiously enough the\r\nhighest peak of the island, 3900 feet high, is named Kolowrat, a renowned\r\nAustrian name, although it could hardly have been an Austrian navigator\r\nwho gave it to this mountain. Many others of these islands, however, have\r\nGerman names, though the majority indicate their discovery by the French\r\nnavigators, Bougainville, Senville, and Dumont d'Urville, to whom the\r\nsea-faring world are indebted for their first acquaintance with this\r\ninteresting group. During the afternoon a heavy blow came on from the\r\nS.S.E., upon which we put about and steered E. by S., but had hardly made\r\nthe alteration, ere it came on to blow from N.N.E., with such fearful\r\nviolence that the cross-jack-yard, which was already sprung, broke in two,\r\nand the sheet of the main try-sail gave way. It was the heaviest squall we\r\nencountered during the voyage. Fortunately the cross-jack-yard had as a\r\nprecaution been firmly lashed, so that the two ends continued to hang in\r\nthe air. Consequently what might have been a serious calamity was avoided,\r\nand the result of the accident was confined to the difficult task of\r\ndisengaging the unwieldy shattered yard. Towards evening a heavy rain\r\nfell, and the wind went down. In the course of the profoundly calm night\r\nwhich followed, the current swept us so close in shore, that by morning we\r\nwere not more than two or three miles distant. A few small boats with\r\nnatives were about, which endeavoured to approach us, but only one of\r\ntheir number succeeded. These boats were not ordinary canoes, but\r\nregularly decked and deep-waisted boats, with high stem and stern, not\r\nunlike the boats in use at the Island of Madeira.\r\n\r\nThe one which came alongside was manned by five brownish-black men,\r\nperfectly naked, with thick crisp hair resembling a wig, which seemed to\r\nbe stained red with ochre. By way of special adornment, some wore in their\r\nside hair a yellowish-red tuft, something like a tassel, and apparently\r\nmade of strips of stained bast. One wore a wild boar's tooth in the tip of\r\nthe ear, two others had small cylinders neatly carved out of mussel-shells\r\npassed through the nostrils, as well as rings of the same material around\r\nthe upper arm and below the knee. When the boat had got within about a\r\npistol shot from us, one of the natives rose, and in clear strong tones\r\nshouted to us some unintelligible words, while at the same time he pointed\r\ntowards the land with very eager, energetic gestures. He seemed desirous\r\nof inviting us to come on shore and visit the islands. At the close of\r\nhis address there arose those peculiar reverberating shouts, such as one\r\nwould have expected rather to hear among the Styrian Alps than from a\r\nPapuan of the Solomon Islands! Upon this the rest of his companions rose\r\nlikewise, and waving in their long arms a piece of tortoise-shell, they\r\nkept shrieking Matte-Matte! for an indefinite period. Not one of them knew\r\na single word of English, nor could we make ourselves intelligible even\r\nwith a vocabulary of the dialects used in the adjoining islands. Although\r\ndistant in a direct line N.W. only 60 miles from Stewart's Island and its\r\ninhabitants, they spoke an entirely different idiom, and were likewise\r\ndistinguished widely from any of the latter in colour, make, and\r\nphysiognomy. Notwithstanding a repeated and pressing invitation to come on\r\nboard, they could not be induced to mount the frigate's side, even by the\r\nmost tempting promises, nor even by presents of linen-stuffs, tobacco,\r\narticles of clothing, &c. They seemed to have had but little intercourse\r\nwith vessels. At length, on our repeated signs, they slowly and shyly came\r\nso near that we could throw a rope on board. The most courageous of their\r\nnumber planted his foot on the side rope, but made no attempt to proceed\r\none step further. But we were by this means at all events able to examine\r\nthese singular beings more closely. They all had oval faces, and broad,\r\nflat, long noses. Two were full-grown men, of tall powerful frame, while\r\nthe rest seemed not above from fourteen to sixteen years old. None of\r\nthem were tattooed, but the practice of anointing the body and the want of\r\ncleanliness left many coloured marks upon the skin. One of the lads had a\r\nsort of scaly eruption all over his skin. Beyond the pieces of\r\ntortoise-shell already mentioned, and the ornaments they wore upon their\r\nbodies, they had absolutely nothing in their boats, not even fruit or\r\nother natural products. They rowed a considerable distance after empty\r\nbottles which were pitched into the sea, and one of them seemed to attach\r\nsuch importance to the possession of these, that he plunged into the water\r\nto swim after them, and thus secure them the more readily.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately our intercourse with these islanders of the Solomon group\r\nwas confined to the little episode above related, and as a favourable\r\nbreeze once more sprang up, we soon lost sight of these simple savages and\r\ntheir island. On this occasion the members of the Expedition were\r\nunanimously of opinion (which is not always the case in matters of\r\npersonal impressions), that the inhabitants of Malayta were the wildest,\r\nmost uncivilized race of men we had as yet encountered in our voyaging to\r\nand fro round the globe.\r\n\r\nDuring the night numerous watch-fires were visible on the peaks of the\r\nisland. Were they lit for the protection of the slumbering inhabitants\r\nagainst the cold and damp of the night, or were they alarm signals for the\r\nentire population of the island, warning them against dangers that menaced\r\nthem? If any apprehensions were entertained by the natives of Malayta\r\nthat we had visited their shores with hostile intent, they must have been\r\nof short duration, for the same wind which prevented our making Port Adam,\r\nwafted us the following morning--it was the 16th October, 1858--in sight\r\nof Sikayana.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[191] Occasionally called Bonabe, Bonibet, Funopet (by the French,\r\nAscension). It lies in 6 deg. 58' N., and 158 deg. 20' E., and, with the two low\r\natolls adjacent of Andema and Paphenemo (called by the English Ant's\r\nIsland and Pakeen respectively) were named by their discoverer, Admiral\r\nLuetke, the Senjawin group, after the name of his ship.\r\n\r\n[192] Captain Andrew Cheyne, of the English mercantile service, to whom\r\nthe sea-faring world is indebted for a very complete and excellent account\r\nof the islands of the West Pacific, and who last visited Puynipet in 1846,\r\nreckoned the population of the island at that period at from 7000 to 8000.\r\nSee a description of islands in the Western Pacific Ocean, North and South\r\nof the Equator, with sailing Directions, &c. p. 94.

It is unknown almost in\r\nIreland, where the poorer classes rarely eat fish.\r\n\r\n[195] Captain Cheyne adds to the foregoing lists the following articles;\r\nfish-hooks, butcher's-knives, chisels, hand-saws, bill-hooks, planes,\r\naugers, piles, iron-pots, razors, needles, twine, drills, gay\r\nparti-coloured cotton cloths, cotton hose, woollen cloths, trinkets, glass\r\nbeads, straw-hats, chests with lock, key, and handles, spirits. The\r\nequivalents as laid down by Captain Cheyne are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  12 hens               =  24 sticks of negro-head tobacco, or 4 ells\r\n  100 yams              =  10    \"           \"         \"       of calico.\r\n  100 bread-fruit       =  10    \"           \"         \"\r\n  100 cocoa-nuts        =  10    \"           \"         \"\r\n  1 cluster of bananas  =   2    \"           \"         \"\r\n\r\n[196] Similar ruins are described by Captain Cheyne as having been also\r\nfound in the forests of Nalan (Strong Island) in the Caroline Archipelago,\r\n5 deg. 21' 30'' N., 163 deg. 0' 42'' E.\r\n\r\n[197] From 1st October, 1856, upon which were marked all the improvements\r\nknown up to 1857.\r\n\r\n[198] Compare Captain Cheyne's sailing directions, p. 68: \"Captain Simpson\r\nof Sydney reported to me in 1845, that a group of low coral islands,\r\ncovered with cocoa-nut trees and inhabited, had been seen in 4 deg. 52' S.,\r\nand 160 deg. 12' E. This may probably be the same group seen by Captain\r\nWellings in 1824, which is laid down in Mr. Arrowsmith's chart in latitude\r\n4 deg. 29' S., 159 deg. 28' E.\" It is matter of surprise in any case that\r\nconsidering the uncertainty which prevails as to the precise locality of\r\nthe reef, its position on the English Admiralty Charts should not at least\r\nbe marked _doubtful_.\r\n\r\n[199] A.

Towards\r\nafternoon, when we were about four or five miles distant from the western\r\nisland, two splendid large canoes approached the ship, in which were\r\nfifteen men stark naked, except for a piece of linen round their loins.\r\nThey were all tall, robust, powerful men, five and a half to six feet\r\nhigh, some with long, others broad faces, all having long noses, of a\r\nlight brown colour, and the greater number with glossy black hair. With\r\nthe exception of one who had whiskers, they were beardless; almost all\r\nbeing tattooed from the elbow to the shoulder. They spoke broken English,\r\nand even had English names. We never saw among the savage races such\r\nfinely built, well-proportioned, healthy-looking men, as these inhabitants\r\nof the coral reef of Sikayana. Their free, unaccustomed, familiar\r\ndeportment was something surprising. But our astonishment reached its\r\nheight when one of these apparently savage children of nature, happening\r\nto find on a table on the gun-deck a draught-board lying open, immediately\r\nchallenged one of the by-standers to a game, which it seems he understood\r\nso well that he beat his antagonist two games out of three. We afterwards\r\nheard that the natives at Sikayana have learned draughts, as also an\r\nEnglish game at cards known as \"odd fourth,\" of which they seemed\r\npassionately fond, from some English sailors, who several years before had\r\nspent five months on these islands, preparing Trepang, or _biche-de-mar_,\r\nfor the Chinese market, those sea-slugs having formerly been found here in\r\nlarge quantities.\r\n\r\nTo our question whether they had fresh provisions for sale, and of what\r\ndescription, they replied that they possess on the island plenty of Taro,\r\ncocoa-nuts, bananas, pigs, and poultry, which they would willingly\r\nexchange for fish-hooks, tobacco, calico, gunpowder, ammunition, biscuit,\r\nplaying-cards, and ornaments for their wives. For money they did not show\r\nthe slightest desire, and of the value of gold they seemed to be utterly\r\nignorant. They showed the utmost eagerness for playing-cards and trinkets.\r\n\r\nWe now also learned that there was on the island one white settler, an\r\nEnglish sailor. This man attempted to come off to the frigate in a small\r\ncanoe, but owing to night setting in, he could not reach her. As these\r\nhearty people were taking their leave, we promised to pay them a visit\r\nearly next morning, with which they seemed highly delighted.\r\n\r\nThere still remained the same evening one mournful duty for those on board\r\nthe _Novara_. During the afternoon one of our sailors had died after\r\nprotracted sufferings consequent on dysentery, and we had now, for\r\nsanitary reasons, to commit his remains to the deep the very evening of\r\nhis death. It was already dark when the officers and crew were mustered on\r\ndeck, to pay the last honours to the departed. The captain gave the\r\ncustomary orders, the ship's bell tolled, the narrow plank, on which lay\r\nthe body of the deceased sewn up in his hammock, was brought to the\r\ngangway, where an iron weight was attached to the body by the feet, and\r\nlast of all the plank being tilted up, the heavy body plunged into the\r\nwaves with a hollow splash, and the watery tomb closed over him.\r\n\r\nWe looked down into the abyss and beheld myriads of stars reflected in\r\nall their lustre in the smooth mirror of the ocean; the deep, blue,\r\nunfathomable ocean appearing like a second firmament beneath our feet!\r\nNothing in the gay scene around seemed out of harmony with the mournful\r\nact which the community of Christians on board the _Novara_ had been\r\ncelebrating. Everything about us--the brightly glistening stars, the\r\nwhispering ripple of the waves, the balmy atmosphere, all left an\r\nimpression of a higher state of felicity and tranquil happiness, and\r\nseemed to remind us that everything in the universe, even the poor remains\r\nwe had just committed to the waves, obeyed but one eternal, immutable law!\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 17th October, three boats put off from the _Novara_ with\r\nsome of the officers and all the naturalists of the Expedition, bound for\r\nSikayana, between three and four miles distant, while the frigate cruised\r\nabout in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nStewart's Atoll (8 deg. 22' S., 162 deg. 58' E.) is a semi-lunar coral reef of\r\nabout sixteen miles in circumference, with a deep lagoon in its centre,\r\nand five small wooded islands on the reef itself, which are visible from\r\nthe deck of a ship about twelve miles away, and were first discovered by\r\nCaptain Hunter, in May, 1791. These islands are named Sikayana, Faole,\r\nManduiloto, Barena, and Maduawe, and are so overgrown with cocoa-nut\r\npalms, that they appear capable of supporting a population of about 1000\r\nsouls (with the wants and requirements of men in the tropics).\r\n\r\nThe two largest islands, Sikayana and Faole, lie exactly at the sharp\r\nhorns of the lune-shaped atoll. Here we again had an opportunity of\r\nobserving the configuration of which all known atolls furnish examples,\r\nviz. that the islands found adjoining these reefs are almost invariably at\r\nthe projecting extremities, where the surf rages on either side, and where\r\nconsequently the conditions are most favourable for the heaping up of\r\ndetached fragments of coral. The area of habitable dry land is to the\r\nextent of the reef in the proportion of 1 : 21. As may readily be assumed\r\nfrom the physical conditions of the islands, there is no drinkable water\r\nto be found upon them; the liquid contents of the cocoa-nut when fresh is\r\nalmost the only beverage of the inhabitants, and hence the first thing the\r\nnatives asked for when they came on board was for some \"drinking-water,\"\r\nsince, except of course during the wet season, when they catch the\r\nrain-water, this is a rarity with them--we might almost say an article of\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\nSikayana, the Big Island of the English, the most easterly and largest of\r\nthe islands, is about 1 1/6th statute mile in length, and lies in 8 deg. 22'\r\n24'' S., and 163 deg. 1' E. The reef which surrounds the island sinks at\r\ncertain points sheer downwards, so that a ship may in perfect safety\r\napproach within a cable's length. We had to sail for a considerable time\r\nalong this line of reef, on which the sea beat with a thundering surf, ere\r\nwe came to one of those spots on the N.W. side where it is practicable in\r\na boat to pass the atoll reef into the tranquil lagoon, which it encloses.\r\nAt all times, even in the calmest weather, a tremendous surf roars against\r\nthe reef, and even this point is inaccessible when there is a fresh breeze\r\nblowing. Here we found some of the canoes of the natives awaiting our\r\napproach, who now, as though they had been on the look-out for our\r\narrival, came off to us, some in their boats, others swimming, to inform\r\nus that, it being ebb-tide, the entry into the lagoon was not very easy,\r\nbut that at high-water one could pass right over the reef, in even larger\r\nboats than ours. It was accordingly arranged that two of the boats should\r\nanchor outside the reef, and only one should be hauled inside the lagoon\r\nwith a rope for our further use. But even this could not be managed until\r\nby removing all baggage and transhipping almost her entire crew, she had\r\nbeen made sufficiently light.\r\n\r\nThe passage between the coral reefs and the lagoon is at high-water about\r\nthree feet deep, but at lowest ebb it is barely a foot in depth, and three\r\nto four feet wide, and then the reef juts up at most points to such\r\nextent, that a skilled equilibrist may (although not to the advantage of\r\nhis soles) easily reach the interior of the lagoon without wetting his\r\nshoes. As soon, however, as this narrow entrance, which is about 300 feet\r\nlong, has been passed, the navigation becomes easier. The appearance of\r\nthe reef was very peculiar. Corals of every description, _Astraeae_,\r\n_Maeandrinae_, _Madriporae_, form a sort of series of clusters of\r\nstone-bushes, among which beautifully mottled fish swim about, while\r\nstarfish of an exquisite indigo blue, and mussels of the most\r\nextraordinary forms, people the ground.\r\n\r\nThe atoll presents some very remarkable geological features. At its N.W.\r\nside, close to the reef and as it were growing to it, stand two singular\r\nvase-shaped rocks, from 8 to 10 feet in height. While their base is\r\nbathed by the sea, their upper portions, which are about 20 feet in\r\ndiameter, present the spectacle of luxuriant grass, brushwood, and one or\r\ntwo fruit-bearing cocoa-nut palms, so that the two crags looked like two\r\ngigantic flower-pots attached to the reef. They seem to be all that\r\nremains of an island which Ocean had first thrown up, and was now busy\r\nwearing away.\r\n\r\nAnother geological peculiarity is the occurrence of heaps of pumice-stone.\r\nThese are found about the size of walnuts over the entire interior of the\r\nisland of Faole at those places which the swell of the waves cannot reach\r\neven in the stormiest weather, where they occur in such immense quantities\r\n(though there are no traces of them on the sand or shingle of the actual\r\nbeach) that we may take for granted that the convulsion which brought them\r\nhere must have occurred in times long gone by, the more so as this\r\nsuperposed pumice-stone exercises a marked and obvious influence upon the\r\nvegetation of the island. So far as its soil consists of heaps of\r\nfragments of coral and mussel-shells, the cocoa-nut palm reigns almost\r\nalone, whereas as soon as the pumice-stone region is reached, there begins\r\nan exceedingly luxuriant growth of lofty forest trees with huge trunks and\r\numbrageous foliage, and an astonishingly abundant _flora_ of species\r\napparently peculiar to these Atoll islands. The English naturalist Jukes,\r\nwho accompanied Captain Blackwood on his survey of Torres Straits, found\r\nbeds of pumice along the entire east and north coasts of Australia, over\r\nan extent of 2000 miles, and under numerous special conditions, but most\r\nfrequently on flat grounds elevated about ten feet above high-water mark\r\nand more or less distant from the beach--never upon the beach itself. The\r\noccurrence of pumice in such vast quantities is of no slight interest in a\r\ngeological point of view. It must have been some tremendous natural\r\nconvulsions, an earthquake wave of enormous lateral dimensions, which\r\nthrew up this pumice-stone, and deposited it throughout this entire region\r\nat the same height above high-water mark. Since this phenomenon occurred,\r\nthe general level of the coasts and islands on which this deposit of\r\npumice is found, can scarcely have undergone any considerable alteration,\r\nif one is not inclined to assume for the entire region a perfectly equal\r\nelevation or depression.\r\n\r\nThe whole party of Excursionists had wandered along the reef to a spot at\r\nwhich we could embark once more, so as to row over to the next island,\r\nFaole, which, however, the natives do not much frequent, except\r\noccasionally to collect cocoa-nuts and pandanus fruits. But as one main\r\nobject had to be accomplished, namely, the supply of the ship with fresh\r\nprovisions, which were not found here, some of the party went off to the\r\nprincipal settlement on the island of Sikayana, to barter some goods they\r\nhad brought, against as much private supplies for themselves as could be\r\nconveniently conveyed to the boats and so taken on board.\r\n\r\nWhile the natives were paddling along in their elegant canoes, escorting\r\nus as far as Sikayana, we offered a seat in our boat to the only white man\r\non the island, the English sailor already mentioned. This man was named\r\nJohn Davis, about forty years of age, a native of Greenwich, and was,\r\naccording to his own story, left behind against his will by Captain Ross,\r\na \"sandal-wooder,\" who had visited this group in 1858. He stated he had\r\njust before been with Captain Ross at the Tonga Islands, where the captain\r\nsent two sailors on shore to fell sandal-wood. These men, however, got\r\ninto a quarrel with the natives, who would not permit them to rob them of\r\ntheir property, in the course of which they lost their lives. The captain\r\nimmediately proceeded to the islands himself with some of his crew well\r\narmed, attacked the unfortunate natives, shot five, and then sailed off.\r\nDavis had become obnoxious to the captain, because in consequence of\r\nover-work he had fallen ill with intermittent fever, and could not work,\r\nupon which his remorseless superior cast about how to get rid of the now\r\nuseless seaman, and resolved to put him ashore by force on the next island\r\nwhich came in sight. What a fearful doom! To be abandoned, sick and\r\nhelpless, on a lone island far from the highways of the world, where ships\r\nbut seldom touched, and amid savages with whose tongue he was\r\nunacquainted! If even one were disposed to doubt the possibility of such\r\ninhuman cruelty, it would find mournful confirmation in many similar\r\ninstances. To this charge the \"sandal-wooders\" are especially amenable,\r\nwho visit the islands of the South Sea to collect the costly sandal-wood,\r\nand in the prosecution of their enterprise seem to go upon the exclusive\r\nprinciple that the coloured man has no property over the natural wealth\r\nof these islands, and has no right to resist the wishes of the white man!\r\n\r\nCommander Erskine of H.M.S. _Savannah_, mentions a case in which an\r\nEnglish merchantman, engaged in the sandal-wood traffic, entered into an\r\nengagement to employ his whole crew in assisting one native tribe to\r\noverpower its neighbour, in return for which timely assistance certain\r\nplaces were pointed out where the coveted sandal-wood was found in great\r\nabundance. A battle took place, and a number of prisoners were carried on\r\nboard the ship, of whom, during the passage to the sandal-wood-producing\r\nislands, several were in the presence of the European crew coolly\r\nslaughtered and eaten by their cannibal foes of the Fee-jee Islands!!\r\n\r\nDavis, whom the natives for distinction's sake called simply \"the white\r\nman,\" could not expatiate enough on the cordiality and kind treatment he\r\nreceived from the poor inhabitants of Sikayana during his stay. Since\r\nApril no ship had called at the island, or even been visible from it. He\r\nbegged the favour of a passage to Sydney, which was readily accorded him\r\non condition he would first repay all his obligations to the natives, and\r\nthat on their side there should be no objections made to his leaving. On\r\nour arrival in Sydney we learned that Captain Ross, who had put Davis\r\nashore at Sikayana, had been tried for another still greater atrocity; he\r\nhad inflicted Lynch-law, by hanging some of the natives of New Caledonia\r\nat his yard-arm. Ross was somewhat later acquitted by the judges at\r\nSydney, but public opinion reversed the verdict.\r\n\r\nAfter a row of an hour and a half we at last reached the island of\r\nSikayana, having previously met three canoes, one of which was manned by\r\ntwelve rowers, who now entered on a sort of regatta contest with us. These\r\ncanoes, not more than a foot and a half wide, glide with uncommon velocity\r\nthrough the water, but despite their outriggers, they are not adapted for\r\ncarrying much provisions. We found it quite easy to land at the place, and\r\ndrew up our boat upon the sandy beach.\r\n\r\nThe world of these islanders, the entire area of dry habitable land upon\r\nthis coral reef, is about one-eighth of an English square mile; no stream,\r\nno mountain, no eminence adorns the island, the highest part of which is\r\njust sufficiently elevated to enable the winds and waves to heap up sand\r\nand debris; around it on every side is the boundless ocean, and its\r\nmineral wealth is reduced to one single mineral, carbonated chalk,\r\ndeposited in the brine by thousands of millions of coral-animals. Hither\r\ntoo the ocean in some extraordinary cases wafts pumice and other stones\r\nlighter than water, which somewhat improve the soil, or occasionally\r\nstones are transported, entangled in the roots of floating trees, with\r\nwhich the denizens of this little place can grind the mussel-shells, of\r\nwhich they make all their tools, as well as knives and hatchets.\r\n\r\nThe immense vegetable kingdom has but 20 or 30 representatives here, whose\r\nseeds have been transported hither by the sea from richer and more\r\ncongenial soils, and thrown up by it upon the strand. Animals are still\r\nmore scarce. A few sea-swallows and insects form the whole Fauna of the\r\ngroup. The sea furnishes the only supply of animal food, in the shape of\r\nfish, crabs, and shell-fish. One may well ask, what degree of moral or\r\nspiritual development can be attained by a race of men whose sphere of\r\naction is confined to a solitary coral reef! Yet the mode of existence of\r\nthe inhabitants of Stewart's Islands is by no means of the most primitive\r\nor simple nature; through the occasional visits of ships they have\r\nobtained much, by which they have sensibly improved their condition. They\r\nnow possess swine, poultry, and various tubers, which seem greatly to\r\nthrive on the island, and which they can now exchange for other articles\r\nof prime necessity.\r\n\r\nSikayana is the only member of the group which is permanently inhabited,\r\nand that by a sincerely hospitable, most friendly race. Their origin is\r\nvariously accounted for.\r\n\r\nAmong the natives themselves there is a dim tradition that Captain Cook\r\ntransported hither the first settlers. Another version is, that the first\r\ninhabitants came from South Island, 130 miles W. of Stewart's Islands, and\r\nthat they were brought hither by whalers, which latter, when they no\r\nlonger needed the services of these poor people, sought how most easily to\r\nget rid of them. At the same time several English and American sailors,\r\nwho at various times have been left in these islands in consequence of\r\nsickness, want of further employment, love of adventure, or quarrels with\r\ntheir captains, must have largely contributed to the present quite\r\npeculiar mixture. The practice of leaving upon any suitable island such\r\nnatives of the South Sea groups as may take service with English or\r\nAmerican whalers, is very common, and sufficiently explains the mode of\r\nfirst settling many of these islands of Oceania.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Cheyne, who has greatly contributed to our more intimate\r\nknowledge of the islands of the West Pacific, visited Sikayana in\r\nSeptember, 1847, the population amounted to 48 men, 73 women, and 50\r\nchildren, who inhabited a small village lying on the lagoon at the eastern\r\nend of the island. Although eleven years had elapsed ere we visited this\r\nsimple community, their numbers did not appear materially to have\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nConsidering the powerful, healthy appearance of the natives, it should\r\nseem that we must ascribe this stagnation in amount of population less to\r\nthe influence of climate, than to the ravages of the various diseases\r\nwhich are from time to time introduced by foreign ships. Thus we saw one\r\nwoman whose whole body was deeply marked with small-pox, and presented a\r\nliving example that the fell scourge of all uncivilized races is no longer\r\nunknown in Sikayana.\r\n\r\nAt the landing-place we were received by the king of the island, a very\r\naged man with grey hair and silver beard. He sat on the grass close to the\r\nshore under the shade of cocoa-nut palms, driving away with his hand the\r\nflies which were stinging his naked body. After a brief welcome he\r\ninvited us to be seated beside him on Nature's own soft green carpet.\r\n\r\nThe natives whom we met here were all tall handsome men, with good\r\nfeatures, decidedly of a European cast. The hair was black, very crisp,\r\nbut not the slightest appearance of being woolly. Many had shaved it till\r\nthere only remained a long tail; most of them had their arms and legs\r\ntattooed, but wore no ear or nose ornaments like the Solomon Islanders.\r\nRound the loins they wore a sort of girdle, four or five inches wide, of\r\nstrips of plants plaited by the women. In addition to this, most of them\r\nwore some piece of European clothing; drawers, old caps, but most commonly\r\na sort of jacket without sleeves made of calico, which only covered the\r\nback and chest. Like the natives of the Nicobars, they showed great\r\ncuriosity to learn our names, and kept repeating them over and over,\r\napparently to impress them upon their memory. They had beyond a doubt\r\ntaken their own names from sailors and ship captains, with whom they had\r\nonce been in communication.\r\n\r\nClose to the shore, among some scattered palm-trees, stood a few wretched\r\nhuts, compared with which the bee-hive huts of the Nicobar Islanders\r\nappear like palaces. They consisted of a roofing woven of cocoa-nut\r\npalm-leaves, planted upon the naked soil which serves as a floor, and\r\nclosed in front and rear with mats of similar texture. The interior was no\r\nless poverty-stricken than the exterior. We could see no articles of\r\nfurniture beyond a few baskets and battered boxes, in which the islanders\r\nstow away their small property.\r\n\r\nA crowd of eager expectants had gathered round the crates of merchandise\r\nwhich our sailors had brought on shore, and the barter began.\r\n\r\nThe natives had swine, poultry, a few eggs, papayas, Taro, cocoa-nuts, and\r\nbananas to offer, while we had an assortment of knives, hatchets, saws,\r\nflints, fish-hooks, calico, linen, blue cloth, ribbons, linen-thread,\r\nneedles, coarse tobacco, biscuit, red coral, glass beads, empty bottles,\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\nThis commerce was something higher than a mere barter--it had also a\r\npsychological interest of its own. Useful goods and tools found a much\r\nless demand than baubles and objects of personal adornment; and for a\r\nstring of glass beads only fit to hang round the neck of a wife, or to put\r\nas a bracelet upon the arm of some little dusky daughter, provisions\r\nenough were given away to have supported an entire family for days.\r\n\r\nRed and green seemed the colours most in demand, and the small beads were\r\nin far more request than the larger and heavier descriptions, even if\r\nthese latter were more costly and neat. It seemed the women were not\r\npermitted to show themselves at market, which must have been a sore enough\r\ndisappointment for many; but the men earnestly requested before closing\r\nwith an offer to be permitted to carry off the coveted prizes, leaving\r\ntheir own articles of barter in pledge, apparently with the gallant\r\nattention of first of all obtaining the advice and consent of their\r\nbetter halves. Hence it frequently happened that the article first\r\nselected was exchanged for some other widely different, or the whole\r\nbargain given up.\r\n\r\nThe women whom we afterwards saw in their huts were all tall and\r\npowerfully built, but very unattractive, the majority appearing\r\nprematurely old. The sole covering was a piece of gay-coloured calico\r\ntolerably wide, which they wore around their loins. Their lower limbs and\r\nfaces were tattooed, the latter however with only a few cross-bars.\r\n\r\nThe two hampers of assorted articles, which was our stock in trade, were\r\nere long nearly emptied, and as the sailors would have found it hard work\r\nto bring off the provisions we had purchased in our small boat, it was\r\nagreed to break up our improvised exchange, and return to Faole with our\r\nvaluable cargo of fresh provisions.[200]\r\n\r\nWhile the barter was going on, the author of this narrative occupied\r\nhimself with making some anthropometrical measurements, and at the same\r\ntime noting down a few cursory remarks respecting these interesting\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe chief food of these islanders consists of fish, cocoa-nuts, taro, and\r\nthe fruit of the pandanus (_dawa_); only at rare intervals do they taste\r\npork or poultry. The rearing of pigs and poultry is chiefly carried on for\r\nthe purpose of trading with foreign vessels, so as to obtain in return the\r\nproducts of a higher civilization. Their fish-nets are prepared from the\r\nrind of their trees. A few looms which they also possess have been given\r\nthem by whale-fishers. The cincture round the loins, which is their sole\r\narticle of apparel, is also prepared from the inner bark of the tree.\r\n\r\nWhen the king dies, the oldest member of the community is elected his\r\nsuccessor. At their festivals they sing in a sort of monotonous drone, and\r\nblow at the same time through mussel-shells.\r\n\r\nWhen mourning for the dead, they stain their faces red with the seeds of\r\nthe _Bixa orellana_, and wear a piece of white calico, shaped something\r\nlike a capuchin's hood, which reaches down till it covers the shoulder.\r\nOne native, who was wearing one of these head coverings, could not be\r\ninduced to traffic, nor even to approach the place where our improvised\r\nmarket was being held, because, as he made us understand, one of his near\r\nrelatives had lately died. Altogether the inhabitants of Sikayana struck\r\nus as a primitive, very moral, and honourable race, and it made us almost\r\nmelancholy to think that these excellent people should be without the\r\nblessings of Christianity. To our great amazement, however, we learned\r\nthat the natives themselves strenuously opposed the settlement in their\r\nmidst of any missionaries of any Christian denomination,--\"Because,\" said\r\nthey, \"all their Kai-kai (i. e. their food) would belong to the\r\nmissionaries.\" This naive reply reminds us of a similar remark on the part\r\nof the Quiche Indians, which we once overheard in the highlands of\r\nGuatemala, in whose language a missionary or priest is known as\r\nKi-sol-re-le-ak-uch, which being interpreted means \"devourer of all hens!\"\r\nAnd just as among the Mormons every care is taken to keep certain\r\nprofessions out of their community, as, for instance, the physician, in\r\norder to prevent illness, or the lawyer, with the intent to keep away\r\nlaw-suits, thus in their simplicity the natives of Sikayana have fallen\r\ninto the error of viewing the missionary, that moral physician, as only of\r\nimportance or of necessity in those places where there are really\r\nspiritual and moral evils to cure!\r\n\r\nThe liquors of Europe are as yet but little known to the inhabitants of\r\nSikayana. In none of the huts could we discern any sort of spirituous\r\nfluids, nor was any offered to us. Even during the trading, amid the\r\ndemands for every sort of article, no desire was expressed for them, not a\r\nquestion even was asked respecting them, whereas hitherto all the wild or\r\nsemi-savage races with which we came in contact at once clamoured for\r\n\"Brandy,\" and not seldom presented themselves in a riotous condition.\r\nThat there is as yet no demand for spirits at Sikayana shows how little\r\nintercourse they can as yet have had with civilization. In former years\r\nthis group was occasionally visited by American and English merchantmen,\r\nowing to the abundance of Trepang. Since the year 1845, however, when one\r\nAmerican captain collected 250 Chinese piculs[201] (about 15 tons), and\r\nten years later when Captain Cheyne in the course of nine months gathered\r\n265 piculs (about 16-3/4 tons), the business is no longer profitable and\r\nat present years sometimes slip by without a ship lying to off Sikayana.\r\n\r\nAs these worm-like animals,[202] which in the dried state command, like\r\nthe Salangan swallows' nests, a high price as a costly delicacy in China\r\nand Japan, form an important article of commerce and employ a considerable\r\nnumber of ships annually, we shall indulge in a few remarks on the very\r\nlaborious operations of preparing the Trepang.\r\n\r\nOf the large number of varieties of Trepang which are found among the\r\ncoral reefs of the Pacific, there are only ten suited to the Chinese\r\nmarket, which are accurately distinguished by their special names. As they\r\nfetch a price according to quality of from 6 to 35 dollars per picul, it\r\nis a matter of great importance to obtain the very highest qualities.\r\n\r\nThe four species most in demand are known in China by the following\r\nnames,--_Bangkolungan_, _Kiskisan_, _Talipan_, and _Munang_, each of which\r\nhas a distinctive appearance, and is found at various depths on the coral\r\nreefs.\r\n\r\n_Bangkolungan_, when captured, is from 11 to 15 inches in length, of an\r\noval form, brown on the back, white on the belly, incrusted with chalk,\r\nand with a row of papillae or warts along the side. This species is hard,\r\nstiff, and possesses hardly any means of progression beyond expanding and\r\ncontracting at will. They are found on the inner edge of the coral reef in\r\ncoral-sandy ground, under water of from 2 to 10 fathoms, and are difficult\r\nto get at without diving. Kiskisan is from 6 to 12 inches long, oval, very\r\nblack, smooth on the back, dark grey belly, and with a row of papillae\r\nalong its side. This description is found in shallow water near the\r\nhighest portion of the reef, and on a bottom of coral and sand. _Talipan_\r\nvaries in length from 9 inches to 2 feet, and is the most peculiar-looking\r\nof all the Trepang species. This sort is found in all parts of the reef,\r\nbut chiefly in water of from 2 to 3 fathoms. It is of a dark red colour,\r\nand less bulky than either of the sorts already described. The back is\r\ncovered with large red spots, which readily distinguish it from all other\r\nspecies. It is more flexible than the black sort, and more difficult to\r\nprepare. _Munang_ is oval, small, quite black, and rarely measures above\r\neight inches in length. It has neither warts nor other excrescences, and\r\nis found in shallow water on the coral flats, and frequently also among\r\nthe sea-tangle along the shore. It is this sort which the Americans\r\nusually catch at the Fee-jee Islands. In the Chinese markets, a picul of\r\n_Munang_ is worth 15 to 25 dollars. Besides these four principal species,\r\nthere are a variety of less valuable descriptions, such as Zapatos-China,\r\nLowlowan, Balati-blanco, Matan, Hangenan, and Zapatos-Grande.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare these four sorts of Trepang for commerce, they are\r\nfirst soaked in a large iron kettle for from 5 to 10 minutes in boiling\r\nwater, and when thoroughly heated through, are taken out. The portion of\r\nthe animal which is cut off, when well boiled, should be of an amber\r\ncolour tinged with blue, and feel somewhat like Indian rubber.\r\n\r\nA certain degree of dexterity and practice are requisite for boiling\r\nTrepang to the proper point and afterwards drying it. While it becomes\r\npuffed out through too sudden an application of heat, and porous like\r\nsponge, too low a temperature or too short a time destroys it on the other\r\nhand, and in 24 hours it becomes quite tainted. Trepang dried in the sun\r\nis more valuable than that dried on the island, nor does the native ever\r\ncare for those he dries over his wood fire. Probably the former mode of\r\npreparing it would not pay for a ship, since at least twenty days are\r\nnecessary to dry Trepang in the sun, whereas over a wood fire the same\r\nend is attained in four days.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the precautions requisite properly to prepare Trepang are so\r\nmanifold and require such an expenditure of time, that only those who for\r\nyears have been exclusively devoted to the business can secure a\r\nsuccessful result. Consequently the trade is exceedingly remunerative, and\r\nnumbers of captains have within a very few years realized a competency and\r\neven affluence by preparing Trepang for the Chinese market.\r\n\r\nWe employed our time, when sailing back to the island of Faole, in\r\nfinishing a small vocabulary of the language in use by the inhabitants of\r\nthe Stewart Island group, which we accomplished with the last stroke of\r\nthe oar that brought our heavily-laden boat back to Faole, where the rest\r\nof our companions already anxiously awaited our return. We had occasion to\r\nremark with surprise the perseverance and readiness of comprehension of\r\none native named Karosi, to whose assistance we are entirely indebted for\r\nthe preparation of this vocabulary.\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of about four hours on the island, we returned to the ship\r\nabout 4.30 P.M., and by sundown were again under weigh for Sydney.[203] If\r\nthe inhabitants of the Solomon group were the most savage race of men we\r\nencountered throughout our cruise, these amiable Sikayanese left on us the\r\nimpression of being the most moral and peacefully disposed race of\r\naborigines that we became acquainted with, and even to this day the few\r\nfleeting but highly suggestive hours we spent with these primitive people\r\nare among the most singular, yet delightful, on which memory rests, when\r\nrecalling the incidents of our circumnavigation.[204]\r\n\r\nA fresh breeze hurried us rapidly to the southward during the 18th, but we\r\nsoon entered once more upon the region of squalls[205] and calms, and on\r\n19th and 20th October we were lying listlessly about 15 miles E., by\r\nchart, from Sesarga,[206] called also _Ile de Contrariete_ (9 deg. 49' S.,\r\n162 deg. 13' E.), condemned to inactivity to the northward of San Christoval.\r\nWe could now satisfy ourselves that it is quite erroneous to identify this\r\nisland with that seen by Pedro de Ortega in 1567, round in shape, and with\r\na lofty volcano in its midst continually throwing up smoke and steam. _Ile\r\nde Contrariete_, as seen from the deck of our frigate, presented the\r\nappearance of a long wooded ridge, averaging about 800 feet in height,\r\nwhereas some of the peaks of San Christoval, 3000 or 4000 feet in height,\r\npresented all the configuration peculiar to a volcanic island; this was\r\nespecially the case with one remarkably regular cone of about 2000 feet in\r\nheight, which rises quite close to Cape Surville. So that Burney's theory\r\nseems the most probable, that Ortega's Sesarga is no other than Mount\r\nLammot, 8000 feet high, on Guadalcanar (9 deg. 50' S., 160 deg. 20' E.).\r\n\r\nAt last, on 21st October, we succeeded in weathering Cape Surville. Thus\r\nthe Solomon's group too were what seamen call \"hull-down,\" and we might\r\nlook forward to a speedy termination to this most tedious and unpropitious\r\nvoyage. For a long month we had, while to the northward of the Solomon's\r\nIslands, vainly sighed for a fresh breeze, and now all at once the S.E.\r\ntrade was blowing so strong that the ship could only lay her course to the\r\nsouthward under reduced sail, close-hauled, and had now to plunge\r\nlaboriously through the heavy seas, which the stiff breeze was knocking\r\nup. On the 25th and 26th October it blew a regular storm from the S.E., we\r\nforging along under double-reefed square-sails, till it almost seemed that\r\nthe end of our voyage was destined to be as stormy as its commencement\r\n\"away in the China seas.\" The ship's timbers creaked and groaned, as\r\nthough they would break into a thousand pieces, while the whistling and\r\nmoaning of the wind, the raging and roaring of the sea, the tremendous\r\ncrash of the waves against our bulwarks, left no peace night or day for\r\nthe \"non-effectives,\" as all passengers not regularly borne upon the\r\nship's books are called on board a man-of-war. As though to increase the\r\ndiscomfort of their position, it happened that the frigate began to make\r\nwater to such an extent, that in what was fortunately but a very small\r\nportion of the hold, the water rose to fifty inches within four hours! It\r\nwas supposed that during the typhoon on the China sea, some of the copper\r\nplates had been wrenched off, and that the water was finding entrance\r\nthrough some leak in her outer timbers, but the most rigid examination\r\nfailed to discover its whereabouts. At all events it must have been at or\r\nabove the water line, as when the sea rose higher than usual, or the ship\r\nlurched much, the water was sure to gain. We were compelled consequently\r\nto vary from our original course by the open sea-way along the west coast\r\nof New Caledonia, and steer for the coral sea, thickly studded with\r\nreefs, which lies between New Caledonia and \"Sandy Cape\" on the shores of\r\nAustralia, as by adopting this dangerous route we should at least have\r\nsmoother water and more favourable winds. Meanwhile, every possible\r\nprecaution was taken in handling the ship, so as not to increase the leak,\r\nand a sail was kept ready to be fothered from without over the leaky part\r\nin case of necessity.\r\n\r\nOn 28th October we had expected to be in sight of the great\r\nhorse-shoe-shaped Bampton Reef. But there was no surf discernible from the\r\nmast-head, only the change to smooth water, which we at once felt, proving\r\nthat the reef really existed, and that we were to leeward of it. Its\r\nposition is so variously laid down on the charts, that while by one chart\r\nwe must have been upon the very reef itself, we were, according to a\r\nsecond, four miles, and, according to a third, fourteen miles to the\r\neastward of it! The last-mentioned seemed to be the most correct, since at\r\nfour miles the surf must have been visible, whereas it would be impossible\r\nto see it at fourteen miles.\r\n\r\nBy 30th October we had passed the latitude of Sandy Cape, and could now\r\nsteer direct for Sydney, the capital of the colony of New South Wales. The\r\nsame day we also crossed the tropic of Capricorn. The temperature, which\r\nhad been falling regularly ever since we left the Solomon Islands, in 28 deg.\r\nS., was as low as 64 deg.4 Fahr., so that we found it advisable to resume our\r\nwoollen clothing.\r\n\r\nTen months we had now spent in the tropics, in the hottest seas of the\r\nglobe, and we now felt, on a beautiful November morning in the southern\r\ntropics, as on a clear spring morning at home. On 4th November we had our\r\nfirst peep of the coast of Australia at Smoky Cape, a fresh easterly\r\nbreeze filling our sails, as we bowled along at 10 knots an hour,\r\nconstantly nearing the next station of our voyage. On the 5th, at 2 P.M.,\r\nthe not very high land round Port Jackson came in sight, and we had not to\r\nalter her course by one spoke, so that our chronometer had given\r\nunmistakeable proof of its accuracy. The coast is for the most part rather\r\nflat and monotonous, but we soon recognized the entrance by North Cape,\r\nwhich rises sheer out of the water at the harbour mouth, where we also\r\ntook a pilot on board. The light-house here, 420 feet above sea-level, had\r\nbeen visible from the deck of the frigate 15 miles away! During the whole\r\nvoyage we had only seen one vessel, an American clipper off the Marianne\r\nArchipelago, and were greatly amazed to find not a single sail in the\r\nvicinity of the port. At last, just as we got abreast of the entrance, we\r\nsaw a steamer and some small boats making for the land. At 6 P.M., after a\r\nvoyage of 82 days, during which we had sailed 5930 miles, the anchor was\r\nlet go in the magnificent harbour of Port Jackson, off Garden Island, to\r\nthe N.E. of the city of Sydney. We had reached in safety the fifth quarter\r\nof the globe!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[200] As it is not uninteresting to know the course of exchange at\r\nSikayana existing between the products of European industry and its native\r\nproducts, we subjoin a few of the most important equivalents:\r\n\r\n  For 5 lbs. tobacco                               one pig.\r\n   \"  20 Steel fish-hooks                             \"\r\n   \"  5 Strings of red corals                         \"\r\n   \"  5 Strings of green and red glass beads          \"\r\n   \"  5 Packets of needles and thread                 \"\r\n   \"  10 Ells of calico                               \"\r\n   \"  5 Fish-hooks                                 ten eggs.\r\n   \"  5 Fish-hooks                                 two hens.\r\n   \"  10 Fish-hooks                                30 pieces of Taro.\r\n   \"  2 Packets needles and threads                30 pieces of Taro.\r\n   \"  1 Packet old playing-cards                   4 hens.\r\n\r\n[201] One Chinese picul = 133-1/2 lbs. English, whereas one Dutch picul =\r\n135-3/5 lbs. English.\r\n\r\n[202] Called Trepang by the Malays, _hai-schni_ by the Chinese, and\r\n_Biche-de-mar_ by both English and French. Of this _holothuria_ or\r\nsea-cucumber (_Holothuria edulis_), there are about 400 tons annually\r\nimported into China from the various islands of the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\n[203] During our excursion, there were taken on board the frigate, which\r\ncruised to and fro in short tacks off the island, about 200 readings of\r\nthe temperature, at depths of every 50 fathoms. It was also intended to\r\nexperiment as to soundings, but the state of the weather prevented this,\r\nas there were continual squalls, and the threatening state of the weather\r\ndid not admit of a boat being launched. However at a distance of half a\r\nmile from the reef, no bottom was found with 200 fathoms of line.\r\n\r\n[204] It is perhaps a duty to our gallant companions of every grade to\r\nvindicate the Expedition once more, and finally, from certain malignant\r\ncalumnies which, upwards of a year after we had left Australian waters,\r\nwere circulated in the columns of even respectable newspapers, accusing\r\nthe crew of the _Novara_ of having been guilty of most scandalous excesses\r\nand wanton robbery while at Sikayana. It seems however needless to insist\r\nthat not the slightest pretext for such infamous aspersions was furnished\r\nby any of the party who spent these few hours in Sikayana, of which we\r\nhave sketched the details in the present chapter. But the fact that they\r\ncould be circulated without its being possible to contradict them on\r\nofficial authority points to a serious defect in our diplomatic position\r\nabroad. True, that no respectable member of the community accredited the\r\nidle mischievous report; true that the leading inhabitants, English,\r\nAmerican, and German, strenuously combated it on every possible occasion,\r\nand in every possible manner. Yet had Austria been a recognized power,\r\ninstead of a friendly guest, it needs but little acquaintance with the\r\netiquette of public and official life to know that the calumny must have\r\nbeen stifled in its birth, by the prompt action of those specially\r\nappointed to protect the fair fame of their country in these distant\r\nwaters. Not till her flag floats regularly to the breeze in the most\r\ndistant countries, instead of being that of a casual visitor, will\r\nAustria, and through her the entire German nation, receive that respect,\r\nand occupy that position among the family of nations, to which her\r\nintelligence, her energy, and her important influence upon the progress of\r\ncivilization alike entitle her.\r\n\r\n[205] The quantity of rain that falls in these latitudes is something\r\nalmost incredible. One single squall from the N.W. was accompanied by a\r\nrainfall of _three_ inches, in the course of _five hours_, whereas the\r\n_entire rainfall_ for the _year_ in London, for instance, is only 18.07\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[206] The native name is Ulatua.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            END OF VOL.
