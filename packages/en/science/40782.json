Berkebile is on the staff of the Museum of\r\n     History and Technology, in the Smithsonian Institution's United\r\n     States National Museum._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the numerous American automotive pioneers, perhaps among the best\r\nknown are Charles and Frank Duryea. Beginning their work of automobile\r\nbuilding in Springfield, Massachusetts, and after much rebuilding, they\r\nconstructed their first successful vehicle in 1892 and 1893. No sooner\r\nwas this finished than Frank, working alone, began work on a second\r\nvehicle having a two-cylinder engine. With this automobile, sufficient\r\ncapital was attracted in 1895 to form the Duryea Motor Wagon Company in\r\nwhich both brothers were among the stockholders and directors. A short\r\ntime after the formation of the company this second automobile was\r\nentered by the company in the Chicago Times-Herald automobile race on\r\nThanksgiving Day, November 28, 1895, where Frank Duryea won a victory\r\nover the other five contestants--two electric automobiles and three Benz\r\nmachines imported from Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the year following this victory Frank, as engineer in charge of\r\ndesign and construction, completed the plans begun earlier for a more\r\npowerful automobile. During 1896 the company turned out thirteen\r\nidentical automobiles, the first example of mass production in American\r\nautomotive history.[1] Even while these cars were under construction\r\nFrank was planning a lighter vehicle, one of which was completed in\r\nOctober of 1896. This machine was driven to another victory by Frank\r\nDuryea on November 14, 1896, when he competed once again with\r\nEuropean-built cars in the Liberty-Day Run from London to Brighton. The\r\ndecision to race and demonstrate their autos abroad was the result of\r\nthe company's desire to interest foreign capital, yet Frank later felt\r\nthey might better have used their time and money by concentrating on\r\nbuilding cars and selling them to the local market. Subsequently, in the\r\nfall of 1898, Frank arranged for the sale of his and Charles' interest\r\nin the company, and thereafter the brothers pursued separate careers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.--WORKMEN IN THE DURYEA FACTORY in Springfield,\r\nMass., working on some of the thirteen 1896 motor wagons. (Smithsonian\r\nphoto 44062.)]\r\n\r\nFrank, in 1901, entered into a contract with the J. Stevens Arms and\r\nTool Company, of Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts, which built automobiles\r\nunder his supervision. This association led in 1904 to the formation of\r\nthe Stevens-Duryea Company, of which Irving Page was president and Frank\r\nDuryea was vice president and chief engineer. This company produced\r\nduring its 10-year existence a number of popular and well-known models,\r\namong them a light six known as the Model U, in 1907; a larger\r\n4-cylinder called the Model X, in 1908; and a larger six, the Model Y,\r\nin 1909. In 1914 when Stevens withdrew from the company, Frank obtained\r\ncontrol. The following year he sold the plants and machinery, liquidated\r\nthe company, and, due to ill health, retired.\r\n\r\nCharles, in the meantime, located in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he\r\nbuilt autos under the name of the Duryea Power Company.[2] Here, and\r\nlater in Philadelphia under the name of the Duryea Motor Corporation and\r\nother corporate names, he continued for a number of years to build\r\nautomobiles, vacuum cleaners and other mechanical devices. Until the\r\ntime of his death in 1938, he practiced as a consulting engineer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Department of the Interior\r\n  U.S. PATENT OFFICE,\r\n  April 1, 1887\r\n  Admit Mr. Charles E.

E. Duryea to the\r\nU.S. Patent Office, 1887. (Gift of Rhea Duryea Johnson.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Automotive Experience\r\n\r\nBorn in 1861 near Canton, Illinois, Charles E. Duryea had learned the\r\ntrade of a mechanic following his graduation from high school, and\r\nsubsequently turned his interests to bicycle repair. He and his brother\r\nJames Frank, eight years younger, eventually left Illinois and moved to\r\nWashington D.C., where they were employed in the bicycle shop of H. S.\r\nOwen, one of that city's leading bicycle dealers and importers. While in\r\nWashington, Charles became a regular reader of the Patent Office\r\nGazette,[3] an act which undoubtedly influenced his later work with\r\nautomobiles. A short time later, probably in 1889, Charles contracted\r\nwith a firm in Rockaway, New Jersey, to construct bicycles for him, but\r\ntheir failure to make delivery as promised caused him to go to Chicopee,\r\nMassachusetts, where he contracted with the Ames Manufacturing Company\r\nto do his work. Moving there in 1890, he obtained for his brother a\r\nposition as toolmaker with the Ames Company. Thus, Frank Duryea, as he\r\nwas later known, also became located in Chicopee, a northern suburb of\r\nSpringfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.--CHARLES E. DURYEA, about 1894, as drawn by\r\nGeorge Giguere from a photograph. (Smithsonian photo 48335-A.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, 1891, Charles found the bicycle business left him\r\nsome spare time, and the gasoline-powered carriages he had read of\r\nearlier came constantly into his mind in these periods of idleness.[4]\r\nHe and Frank studied several books on gasoline engines, among them one\r\nby an English writer (title and author now unknown);[5] this described\r\nthe Otto 4-stroke cycle as now used. Some engineers, however, were\r\nconcerned because this engine, on the completion of the exhaust stroke,\r\nhad not entirely evacuated all of the products of combustion. The\r\nAtkinson engine, patented in 1887, was one of the attempts to solve this\r\nas well as several other problems, thus creating a more efficient cycle.\r\nThis engine was designed so that the exhaust stroke carried the piston\r\nall the way to the head of the engine, while the compression stroke only\r\nmoved the piston far enough to sufficiently compress the mixture. The\r\nunusual linkage necessary to create these unequal strokes in the\r\nAtkinson engine made it seem impractical for a carriage engine, where\r\ncompactness was desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Agents Want{d}_\r\n\r\nSYLPH CYCLES RUN EASY\r\n\r\nPneumatics not enough; springs necessary for comfort & safety Sylph\r\nspring frame saves muscle & nerves & is perfection.

Also in Hartford he\r\ntalked over the problem of a satisfactory engine with C. E. Hawley, an\r\nemployee of the Pope Manufacturing Company, makers of the Columbia\r\nbicycle. Hawley, searching for a way to construct an engine that would\r\nperform in a manner similar to the Atkinson, yet would have the\r\nlightness and compactness necessary for a carriage engine, suggested an\r\nidea that Charles believed had some merit. This idea, involving the use\r\nof what the Duryeas later called a \"free piston,\" was eventually to be\r\nincorporated in their first engine.[7]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6.--J. FRANK DURYEA, about 1894, as drawn by George\r\nGiguere from a photograph. (Smithsonian photo 48335.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstruction Begins\r\n\r\nBack in Chicopee again, Charles began planning his first horseless\r\ncarriage. Frank later stated that they leaned heavily on the Benz\r\npatents in their work;[8] but while the later engine and transmission\r\nshow evidence of this, only the Benz manner of placing the engine and\r\nthe flywheel seem to have been employed in the original Duryea plan.\r\nCharles reversed the engine so that the flywheel was to the front,\r\nrather than to the rear as in the Benz patent, but made use of Benz'\r\nvertical crankshaft so that the flywheel rotated in a horizontal plane.\r\nPreviously most engines had used vertical flywheels; Benz, believing\r\nthat this practice would cause difficulty in steering a propelled\r\ncarriage, explained his reason for changing this feature in his U.S.\r\npatent 385087, issued June 26, 1888:\r\n\r\n     In motors hitherto used the fly-wheels have been attached to a\r\n     horizontal shaft or axle, and have thus been made to revolve in a\r\n     vertical plane, since the horizontal shaft is best adapted to the\r\n     transmission of power. If, however, in this case we should use a\r\n     heavy rotating mass, corresponding to the power employed and\r\n     revolving rapidly in a vertical plane, the power to manage the\r\n     vehicle or boat would become very much lessened, as the flywheel\r\n     continues to revolve in its plane. I therefore so design the\r\n     apparatus that its crank shaft x has a vertical position and its\r\n     fly-wheel y revolves in a horizontal plane.... By this means the\r\n     vehicle is not only easily controlled, but also the greatest safety\r\n     is attained against capsizing.\r\n\r\nTo the Duryea plan, Benz may also have contributed the idea for\r\npositioning the countershaft, though its location is sufficiently\r\nobvious that Charles may have had no need for copying Benz. Charles\r\nwisely differed from Benz in placing the flywheel forward, thus\r\neliminating the need for the long driving belt of the Benz carriage. Yet\r\nhe did reject the bevel gears used by Benz, which might well have been\r\nretained, as Frank was later to prove by designing a workable\r\ntransmission that incorporated such bevel gears. The initial plan, as\r\nconceived by Charles, also included the details of the axles, steering\r\ngear, countershaft with its friction-drum, the 2-piece angle-iron frame\r\nupon which the countershaft bearings were mounted, and the free piston\r\nengine with its ignition tube, since hot-tube ignition was to be\r\nemployed. No provision was made, however, for a burner to heat the tube;\r\nnor had a carburetor been designed, though it had been decided not to\r\nuse a surface tank carburetor. The plans called for no muffler or\r\nstarting arrangement.[9] Many engines of the period were started simply\r\nby turning the flywheel with the hands, and Charles felt this method was\r\nsufficient for his carriage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.--DRAWING SHOWING PRINCIPLE of the Atkinson\r\nengine; this feature is what the Duryeas were trying to achieve with\r\ntheir free-piston engine, by substituting the free piston for the\r\nunusual linkage of the Atkinson.

From Karl Benz und\r\nsein Lebenswerk, Stuttgart, 1953. (Daimler-Benz Company publication.)]\r\n\r\nThe Ames plant customarily had a summer shutdown during August; thus,\r\nduring August of 1891 Charles and Frank had access to a nearly empty\r\nplant in which they could carry on experiments and make up working\r\ndrawings of the proposed vehicle. It cannot now be conclusively stated\r\nwhether any parts were made for the car during August or the remainder\r\nof the year. It is more likely that the brothers attempted to complete a\r\nset of drawings. Frank Harrington, chief draftsman at Ames, may have\r\nhelped out at this time; from Charles' statement of April 14, 1937, it\r\nis learned that he did prepare drawings during 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. BENZ.\r\n\r\nSELF PROPELLING VEHICLE.\r\n\r\nNo. 385,087. Patented June 26, 1888.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 9.--ILLUSTRATION FROM U.S. patent 385087, issued to Carl Benz,\r\nshowing the horizontal plane of the flywheel, a feature utilized by the\r\nDuryeas in their machine.]\r\n\r\nThe first contemporary record of any work on vehicles is a bill, dated\r\nJanuary 21, 1892, for a drawing made by George W. Howard & Company. This\r\ndrawing was made in the fall of 1891 by Charles A. Bartlett, a member of\r\nthe Howard firm and a neighbor of Charles Duryea, according to a\r\nstatement by Charles in the _Automobile Trade Journal_ of Jan. 10, 1925.\r\nHe was then also of the opinion that this drawing may not have had\r\nanything to do with the carriage they were about to assemble, but a\r\nnotation found by Charles at a later date has led him to believe that it\r\npossibly concerned a business type vehicle he had discussed with an\r\nunidentified Mr. Snow.\r\n\r\nBy early 1892 Charles needed capital to finance his venture, an old\r\ncarriage to attach his inventions to, a place to work, and a mechanic to\r\ndo the work. On March 26, he stopped by the Smith Carriage Company and\r\nlooked over a selection of used buggies and phaetons. He finally decided\r\non a rather well-used ladies' phaeton which he purchased for $70. The\r\nleather dash was in so deplorable a state it would have to be recovered\r\nbefore the carriage went onto the road, and the leather fenders it once\r\npossessed had previously been removed; yet the upholstery appeared to be\r\nin satisfactory condition, and the candle lamps were intact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.--PHANTOM ILLUSTRATION of Benz' first automobile.\r\n(From _Carl Benz, Father of the Automobile Industry_, by L. M. Fanning,\r\nNew York, 1955.)]\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Charles was able to interest Erwin F. Markham, of\r\nSpringfield, sufficiently to obtain his financial aid in the project. A\r\ncontract was drawn up between the two men, which stated that Mr.\r\nMarkham was to put up $1000 for which he received a five-tenths share of\r\nthe venture. When the $1000 had been used, he then had the option to\r\ncontinue his aid until the project had been carried to a successful\r\nclimax, and retain his half share, or to refuse further funds and\r\nrelinquish four of his five-tenths interest in the business.[10] Had he\r\neventually chosen the latter, Charles would obviously have had to seek\r\nassistance elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11.--THE HOWARD & CO. BILL showing the first work\r\nperformed toward a motor vehicle. While this may not refer specifically\r\nto the machine now in the museum, it is evidence of early work.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12.--THE SHOP OF JOHN RUSSELL & SONS. It was on\r\nthe second floor of this building that Charles and Frank Duryea built\r\ntheir first motor vehicle. (Courtesy of the _Springfield Union_.)]\r\n\r\nThat same day, March 28, Charles found working space and machinery\r\navailable at John W. Russell & Sons Company in Springfield.[11] The\r\nRussells had recently completed a large government order of shells for\r\nthe famous dynamite guns later used on board the cruiser _Vesuvius_ in\r\nthe Spanish-American War, and this left an entire second floor,\r\napproximately 35 × 85 feet, virtually unoccupied, according to an\r\naffidavit of William J. Russell of April 30, 1926. Now ready to begin\r\nthe actual work, Charles hired his brother Frank to start construction.\r\nFrank started about the first of April, receiving a raise of about 10\r\npercent over the salary he had received at Ames. Before the vehicle was\r\ncompleted a number of other men performed work on some of the parts,\r\namong them William Deats who had been hired by Charles primarily to work\r\non bicycles in the same area, but who occasionally assisted on the\r\ncarriage. Russell Company records show time charged against Charles\r\nDuryea by six other Russell employees: W. J. Russell, P. Colgan, C. E.\r\nMerrick, T. Shea, L. J. Parmelee, and A. A. Poissant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 13.--J. FRANK DURYEA looking over the Russell shop\r\nlathe on which he turned parts for the first Duryea vehicle. Photo taken\r\nabout 1944. (Courtesy of the _Springfield Union_.)]\r\n\r\nIt is Frank Duryea's remembrance that he started work on Monday, April\r\n4. He first removed the body, with its springs, and placed it on a pair\r\nof wooden horses where it remained until the summer of the following\r\nyear. The next step was to remove the rear axle and take it to a\r\nblacksmith shop where the old axle spindles were cut off and welded to a\r\nnew drop-center axle. Following this the front axle spindles were\r\nremoved, the ends of the axle slotted, and a webbed, C-shaped piece\r\ncarrying the kingpin bearings was fitted into each slot, braced from\r\nunderneath by short brackets which were riveted and brazed in place. The\r\nold spindles then were welded to the center of offset kingpins which in\r\nturn were mounted in their bearings in a manner similar to that in which\r\nthe frame of the Columbia high-wheeled bicycle was mounted in its fork.\r\nArms welded to the lower end of the kingpins were connected by the tie\r\nrods to an arm on the lower end of the vertical steering column, located\r\non the center of the axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 14.--A PORTION of the Russell shop records showing\r\ncharges made against Charles Duryea during 1893-1894.]\r\n\r\nWhile work on the running gear advanced, some progress was made in the\r\nconstruction of the engine. Patterns for the castings were fabricated,\r\nmost of them by Charles Marshall on Taylor Street,[12] and castings were\r\npoured. The body or main casting of the engine resembled a length of\r\ncast-iron pipe: it had no bosses or lugs cast on, nor any water jacket,\r\nfor they thought the engine would be kept cool merely by being placed in\r\nthe open air. The front end of the engine was secured to the vehicle by\r\nfour bolts which passed through the halves of the bearings and onto four\r\nprojections on the open end of the engine. As the crankshaft of this\r\nengine was retained in constructing the present engine, it is logical\r\nto assume that the bearings were the same also. The head was cast as a\r\nthick disc, with both intake and exhaust valves located therein, and was\r\nbolted onto the flanged head end of the engine.\r\n\r\nInside the cylinder was the strange arrangement previously suggested by\r\nC. E. Hawley. To the connecting rod was attached a rather ordinary\r\nringed piston, over which was fitted a free, ringless piston, machined\r\nto fit closely the cylinder bore. This floating piston could move freely\r\na distance equal to the compression space. The intention was that on the\r\nintake stroke, suction would open the intake valve, which had no\r\npositive opening arrangement, and draw in the mixture which then was\r\ncompressed as in a regular Otto engine. Fired by the hot-tube ignition\r\nsystem, the force of the explosion would drive both pistons down,\r\nforcing the outer one tight against the head of the smaller one, and at\r\nthe end of the stroke the longer wall of the outer piston would strike\r\nan arm projecting into the cylinder near the open end, moving forward\r\nthe exhaust valve rod to which the arm was attached, thus pushing open\r\nthe valve in the head.[13] On the exhaust stroke the unrestrained outer\r\npiston moved all the way to the head, expelling all of the products of\r\ncombustion and pushing the exhaust valve shut again. With a bore of four\r\ninches or less, this engine, Charles believed, should develop about\r\nthree horsepower and run at a speed between 350 to 400 revolutions per\r\nminute.[14]\r\n\r\nAs no ignition system had yet been provided, they prepared a 4-1/2-inch\r\nlength of one-quarter inch iron pipe, closed at one end, and screwed the\r\nopen end into the head. Heating this tube with an alcohol burner would\r\ncause ignition of the mixture when a portion of it was forced into the\r\nheated tube toward the end of the compression stroke. No attempt was\r\nmade at this time to use the electrical make-and-break circuit used in\r\ntheir second engine, as the free piston would have wrecked the igniter\r\nparts on the exhaust stroke, and the push rod located on the end of the\r\npiston would have prevented the piston from closing the exhaust valve.\r\n\r\nAfter keying the flywheel to the lower end of the crankshaft, Charles\r\nand Frank decided to make an attempt to run the engine. Carrying it\r\ninto a back room, probably during July or August, 1892, they blocked it\r\nup on horses. A carburetor had not yet been constructed, so they\r\nattempted to start the engine by spinning the flywheel by hand, at the\r\nsame time spraying gasoline through the intake valve with a perfume\r\natomizer previously purchased at a drugstore in the Massasoit House.\r\nRepeated efforts of the two men to start the engine resulted in failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 15.--CONJECTURAL drawing of the free-piston engine\r\nused in the Museum vehicle prior to the present engine. (Drawing by A. A.\r\nBalunek.)]\r\n\r\nIn the belief that the defects, whatever they might be, could be\r\nremedied after the engine was installed, the Duryeas went ahead and\r\nmounted the engine in the carriage. To do this they shortened the\r\noriginal reach of the carriage, allowing the engine itself to become the\r\nrear continuation of the reach. The four ears on the front, or open end\r\nof the engine, were bolted to the centrally located frame, with the\r\nbearing blocks in between. This frame, the same one now in the vehicle,\r\nwas constructed of two pieces of angle iron, riveted and brazed\r\ntogether. Greater rigidity was obtained by a number of half-inch iron\r\nrods running from the frame to both front and rear axles. Because of the\r\nabsence of any mounting brackets on the engine casting itself, a wooden\r\nblock with a trough on top to receive the body of the engine was fitted\r\nbetween the engine and the axle, while two U-shaped rods secured it with\r\nclip bars and nuts underneath.\r\n\r\nBeneath the flywheel was mounted the friction transmission of Charles'\r\ndesign. This consisted of a large drum, perhaps 12 inches in diameter,\r\nequal in length to the diameter of the flywheel and keyed to a shaft\r\ndirectly under the center of the crankshaft and parallel to the axles.\r\n(Diameter of drum estimated by examination of existing features.) In\r\nview of the four projections of the frame extending downward and just in\r\nfront of the jackshaft position, it is likely that these supported the\r\nfour jackshaft bearings. Being a bicycle manufacturer, Charles saw the\r\nneed for a differential or balance gear. Accordingly, he purchased from\r\nthe Pope Manufacturing Company a very light unit of the type formerly\r\nused on Columbia tricycles, and installed it somewhere on the jackshaft.\r\nA small sprocket on each end of the shaft carried a chain from the\r\nlarger sprockets clamped to the spokes of each rear wheel. The lower\r\nsurface of the flywheel had been machined so as to form a friction disc,\r\nwith a one-quarter inch depression 3 inches in diameter turned in the\r\ncenter. The drum was positioned so that its upper surface was\r\none-quarter inch below the face of the flywheel. Hanging loosely around\r\nthe drum was an endless belt, one and one-half inches wide, first made\r\nof rather soft rubber packing material. The belt lay on the drum surface\r\nbetween the fingers of a shipper fork. While it lay under the 3-inch\r\ndepression in the center of the flywheel, the belt and the drum were at\r\nrest, but when it was moved away from that depression the belt wedged\r\nitself tightly between the drum and flywheel, the resulting friction\r\ncausing the drum to turn and setting the vehicle into motion. The\r\nfarther the belt was moved toward the outer edge of the wheel, the\r\nfaster the drum and the vehicle moved.\r\n\r\nIn September 1892, Charles, who had contracted with a Peoria, Illinois,\r\nfirm to have bicycle parts manufactured, decided to move to that city.\r\nDeparting on the 22d of September, he did not return to Springfield for\r\nover two years, and thus was not able to participate in the completion\r\nand testing of the carriage. At the time of his departure several units\r\non the carriage were incomplete. A carburetor had not been built, nor\r\nhad a satisfactory burner or belt-shifting device. Charles had\r\nexperimented with various shifting levers just before leaving\r\nSpringfield: however, as he reported later, he did not succeed in\r\ndesigning a workable mechanism.[15] Frank Duryea, now left to finish the\r\nwork unassisted, continued the experiments with the belt shifter. He\r\nfinally worked out a fork mounted on a carriage that was supported by\r\ntwo rods, each of which slid in two bearings. Although the short\r\ndistance between the two bearings caused the shifter carriage to bind\r\noccasionally, the device was thought to be sufficient and was installed\r\njust in front of the frame. Connected to a system of cables, arms, and\r\nrods, possibly similar to the present cam-bar shifter, the shipper-fork\r\ncarriage was moved from side to side by raising or lowering the tiller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 16.--DRAWING of the carburetor used on both Duryea\r\nengines, 1893-1894, showing sight feed on left and choke mechanism on\r\nright. (Smithsonian photo 13455.)]\r\n\r\nTurning now to an efficient burner for heating the ignition tube, Frank\r\nstarted with an ordinary wick-type kerosene lamp with a small metal\r\ntank. Wishing to use gasoline in the lamp, he found it necessary to\r\nfabricate a number of burner units before he found a type that gave him\r\na clean blue flame. He then found the flame to be very sensitive to\r\ndrafts and easily extinguished, and devised a small shield or chimney to\r\nafford it some protection.\r\n\r\nEarly in October, while still working with the burner, Frank developed a\r\nsevere headache. He felt the fumes of the lamp had probably caused it,\r\nand went to his room in the home of a Mr. and Mrs. Patrick on Front\r\nStreet in Chicopee. After he noticed no improvement, a doctor's\r\nexamination showed he had typhoid fever, and on October 5 he was\r\nadmitted to the Springfield Hospital. Here he remained for one month,\r\nbeing discharged on November 5. Returning to his room he was informed\r\nthat because of the fear that he might be a typhoid carrier, the\r\nPatricks preferred him to find other lodgings. He readily accepted the\r\ninvitation of Mr. and Mrs. D. H. Nesbitt of Chicopee to take a room with\r\nthem. After several weeks recuperation in their home, he left\r\nSpringfield to visit his mother in Wyoming, Illinois.\r\n\r\nAfter a restful visit at home Frank Duryea returned to Springfield and\r\nfinished the work on his burner. Now only the lack of a carburetor\r\nprevented a trial of the vehicle. He recalls that he studied several\r\ngasoline-engine catalogs and in one of them, a Fairbanks catalog he\r\nbelieves,[16] he saw a design that seemed to suit his needs. He decided\r\nto simplify the construction and operation of his carburetor and had a\r\nsmall bronze casting made to form the body of it. Inside was a gasoline\r\nchamber with two tapped openings, one to receive a pipe from the\r\n2-gallon gasoline tank mounted above the engine, the other taking a pipe\r\nto the overflow tank underneath the engine, thus maintaining the\r\ngasoline level without the use of a float valve. This latter tank had a\r\nhand pump on one end so that the overflow gasoline could at times be\r\npumped again into the main tank. Gasoline passed from the carburetor\r\nchamber through a needle valve, adjusted by a knob on top, then through\r\na tiny tube that entered the pipe leading to the intake valve. It is not\r\ncertain whether this intake pipe was at first fitted with the choke\r\narrangement later used with the second engine.\r\n\r\nFrank, hoping at last to be rewarded for his efforts by the sound of\r\nexplosions from the engine, was ready to give the carriage an indoor\r\ntrial. Standing astraddle of the reach and facing to the rear, he spun\r\nthe flywheel with both hands, taking care not to get his hands caught\r\nbetween the wheel and the frame. His efforts were in vain, as there was\r\ncomplete failure to obtain ignition. He then made a new ignition tube,\r\nnearly twice as long as the original 4-1/2-inch tube, and turned down\r\nits wall as thin as he thought safety allowed. The thinner wall did not\r\nconduct the heat off so rapidly and thus kept the tube hot enough to\r\npermit ignition. After this slight change, he was able to get a few\r\noccasional explosions but he does not now believe that the engine ever\r\noperated continuously. Each explosion was accompanied by a loud knock,\r\ndue, undoubtedly, to the movement of the free piston. Had the engine\r\noperated continuously, it is likely that the action of the free piston\r\nwould have shortly wrecked the engine. Further efforts appeared\r\nunwarranted until alterations could be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALL AGREEMENTS CONTINGENT UPON STRIKES, ACCIDENTS AND OTHER CAUSES\r\n                     BEYOND OUR CONTROL\r\n\r\n  CABL ADDRESS \"MOTODURYEA,\" PHILADELPHIA      WESTINGHOUSE AND W.

Been working\r\nnights to make up time lost in the day so did not hav much.\r\n\r\nI made a sketch for you but did not show the spring that holds the\r\ncircuit breaker in contact with the spark point. That thin finger was\r\npart of it. A spring was wound spirally--not helically--around the\r\nprojecting end of the breaker pivot and the end of the spring hookt over\r\nthe thin finger. See sketch herwith.\r\n\r\nJust how the central end of the spring wire was fastened to the square\r\nof the pivot I do not kno. We did in some cases bore a hole thru and\r\nsimply stick the spring thru but this put most of the action right at\r\nthe bend in the wire and it broke quickly. So in other cases we fitted a\r\nlight grooved spool or pulley and wound the spring around this and so\r\navoided a sharp bend. If this was used it has been lost with the spring.\r\nA couple generations of boys playing in that barn was too many.\r\n\r\nThe Haynes steering sketch also worries me. If that vertical post came\r\nup thru that slot in the floor the crank had to be long as the sketch\r\nshows in order to get over to the driver conveniently. Then if he tried\r\nto make a complete circle with it he could not reach far enuf forward to\r\ndo it easily. And he had to make a turn or two be cause H shows bevel\r\ngears of about same size so the post had to make same number of turns\r\nthe worm made. Sketch herewith to illustrate my thought.\r\n\r\n  Yrs for the historical facts\r\n         Chas. E. Duryea\r\n\r\nFIGURE 17.--LETTER EXPLAINING the circuit breaker spring and the brass\r\nprojection on top of the ignition chamber. Mr. Mitman was, at the time,\r\ncurator of engineering in the U.S. National Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe two pistons were first pinned together into a single unit which was\r\nprobably ringless, since it is believed the walls of the outer piston\r\nwere too thin to admit rings. Because the piston no longer struck the\r\nexhaust valve, a short rod had to be screwed into the pistonhead; this\r\npushed the valve shut at the completion of the exhaust stroke. The\r\nremaining problem, the opening of the exhaust valve, was solved by\r\nscrewing a device to the side of the cylinder which operated from the\r\nsidewise motion of the connecting rod. This device shifted a small\r\nspacer between the piston and the striker arm of the exhaust-valve rod,\r\npermitting the piston to push open the exhaust valve. On alternating\r\nstrokes the spacer shifted back out of the cylinder; therefore, no\r\ncontact was made between piston and striker arm. Sometime in February\r\n1893, the altered engine was successfully started.\r\n\r\nAt last the transmission could be tested. Will Russell had come upstairs\r\nto watch the trial, and according to a statement by him, given April 30,\r\n1926, Frank, standing to the right of the engine and behind the rear\r\naxle, reached forward and with the combination tiller-belt-shifter,\r\nmoved the belt into driving position. The carriage started forward, but\r\nas it approached the wall of the building Frank discovered that he could\r\nnot get the belt back into the neutral position. In desperation, he\r\ngrasped the rear axle with both hands and was dragged a short distance,\r\nattempting to stop the machine, before it struck the wall. He had,\r\nhowever, sufficiently retarded it so that no damage was done.\r\n\r\nThis short trial demonstrated some of the weaknesses in the friction\r\ntransmission. Since the speed of the surface of the flywheel, in feet\r\nper second, increased in proportion to the distance of the point of\r\ncontact from the center, the outer edge of the belt attempted to run\r\nfaster than the inner edge. This conflict of forces not only put an\r\nundue load on the motor causing a great loss of power, but it also\r\ncreated a tendency for the belt to work towards the outer edge of the\r\nflywheel. Conversely, when the operator desired to return the belt to\r\nneutral, it strongly resisted any efforts to slide it toward the center\r\nof the wheel, as Frank had learned from the wall-bumping incident.\r\nFurthermore, the rubber belt on the friction drum had worn so badly\r\nthat it had to be replaced at least once during the brief experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 18.--IGNITION CHAMBER, switch, and breaker contacts\r\nof the present Duryea engine.]\r\n\r\nAt this point, Frank and Markham felt that the carriage was anything but\r\nsatisfactory. While they were trying to decide what steps should be\r\ntaken next, Frank added one last improvement to the engine. Fearing that\r\nthe uncooled cylinder might suffer damage from the excessive heat, he\r\nconstructed a copper water jacket in two halves, drew them together\r\naround the cylinder with clamping rings and soldered the seams. Asbestos\r\npacking sealed the end joints where the jacket contacted the cylinder.\r\nThinking back, Frank does not recall that he ever used a water tank with\r\nthis engine, though he does remember adding water through the upper\r\njacket opening. The engine was run only for a few brief periods\r\nfollowing this addition.\r\n\r\nObviously this collection of patchwork could not fulfill their needs for\r\nan engine. First, it would be next to impossible to start if the body\r\nwas placed on the running gear, as the flywheel then would be\r\npractically inaccessible. The absence of rings on the piston caused a\r\nfurther loss of power to the already overloaded engine. The flywheel was\r\ntoo light. The absence of any form of governor left the operator with no\r\ncontrol over the engine speed. Ignition was poor, partly owing to the\r\nhot-tube arrangement, and partly to the excessive distance between the\r\nengine and the carburetor. Frank wrote his brother Charles on February\r\n6[17] that in his opinion the mixing chamber was so far from the engine\r\nthat the gasoline could not be drawn into the cylinder as liquid, and it\r\nwas too cold to vaporize and go in as gas. Thus he had difficulty in\r\ngetting the engine started. When it did start the explosions were\r\nunmuffled. Less important to him than these defects, however, was the\r\nawkward and unsightly wooden engine mount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Automobile\r\n\r\n\r\nSometime in the early part of March, Frank convinced Markham that he\r\ncould construct a new and practical engine, using only previously tried\r\nmechanical principles.[18] Drawing up new plans for this engine, he took\r\nthem to Charles Marshall who began work on the patterns for the new\r\nengine castings. After the patterns had been delivered to the foundry,\r\nFrank left Springfield for a short vacation in Groton, Connecticut,\r\nwhere he visited with his fiancée. On May 17, 1893, several weeks after\r\nhis return to Springfield, they were married.\r\n\r\nThe engine castings were undoubtedly received from the foundry prior to\r\nFrank Duryea's marriage, and the work of machining and assembling the\r\nparts went on through the spring and summer. This engine, still on the\r\ncarriage in the Museum of History and Technology, is cased with a water\r\njacket, and has bases on top to support the front and rear bearings of\r\nthe starting crankshaft, and a base with port on the upper right side\r\nwhere the exhaust-valve housing was to be bolted. On the underside are\r\ntwo flanges, forming a base for seating the engine on the axle. A\r\nseparate combustion chamber is cast and bolted to the head. Inside this\r\nchamber are located the igniter parts of Frank's electric ignition\r\nsystem. The fixed part, an insulated electrode, is screwed into the\r\nright side of the chamber and is connected with the ignition switch\r\noutside, to which one of the ignition wires is attached. A breaker arm\r\ninside is pinned to a small shaft extending through the top of the\r\nchamber. Around the breaker-arm shaft is a small coil spring (originally\r\na spiral spring, according to the letter of Charles Duryea shown in fig.\r\n17), anchored below to a thin brass finger extending toward the right\r\nside of the car, and above to a nut screwed tightly onto the shaft. This\r\nnut is also the terminal for the other ignition wire. The action of the\r\nspring keeps the breaker arm and the electrode in constant contact until\r\nthe push rod on the end of the piston strikes the arm and separates the\r\ntwo parts. Breaking contact then produces the ignition spark. Since the\r\nmechanism would spark at the end of both the exhaust and compression\r\nstrokes, the battery current is conserved by a contact strip, on the\r\nunderside of the larger exhaust-valve gear, by means of which the flow\r\nof current is cut off during the greater part of the cycle.\r\n\r\nOn the left side of the combustion chamber is bolted the housing\r\ncontaining the tiny intake valve. A comparatively weak spring seats this\r\nvalve in order that the suction created by the piston can easily pull it\r\nopen. Clamped onto the valve housing is the intake pipe, enclosing the\r\nchoke and carrying the carburetor on its forward side. The choke\r\nconsists of two discs which block the pipe, each with four holes at the\r\nedges and one in the center. Turning one disc by means of a small handle\r\noutside, so that the four outer holes cannot coincide with those in the\r\nother disc, decreases the flow of air and causes all air to rush through\r\nthe center hole, where the tiny carburetor tube passes through. The\r\npresent carburetor was transferred over from the first engine. When\r\nFrank later installed the engine on the carriage he noticed the close\r\nproximity of the intake pipe to the open end of the muffler. Believing\r\nthat the fumes might choke the engine, he attached a long sheet-metal\r\ntube to the intake pipe so that fresh air would be drawn in from a point\r\nfarther forward on the vehicle.\r\n\r\nMoving to the right side of the engine brings the exhaust-valve assembly\r\ninto view. This valve is contained in a casting bolted over the exhaust\r\nport in the side of the cylinder, and from the casting a pipe leads to\r\nthe muffler underneath. The valve is pushed open by a rod connected to a\r\ncrank which is pinned to the lower end of a shaft carrying an iron gear\r\non top. This gear is in mesh with a fiber gear, keyed to the upper end\r\nof the crankshaft, with half the number of teeth. This ratio permits the\r\nopening of the exhaust valve on every other revolution.\r\n\r\nThe crankshaft of the first engine was retained for the new engine, thus\r\ngiving the two engines the same stroke of 5-3/8 inches, but the bore was\r\nincreased slightly to 4-3/8 inches. With this larger bore and with the\r\nengine speed increased to 500 rpm, Frank rated this engine at 4 hp.[19]\r\nA heavier flywheel, with a governor resting in the upper recess, was\r\npressed onto the crankshaft. As the operator of the vehicle had no\r\ncontrol over the carburetor once he climbed into the seat, this governor\r\nwas necessary to maintain regular engine speed. Its function was to move\r\na slide on the exhaust-valve unit to prevent the valve from closing.\r\nThus the engine, with the suction broken, could not draw a charge on the\r\nnext revolution. During the recent restoration of this carriage it was\r\nfound that while most parts are still intact, nearly all of the\r\ngovernor parts are missing. A description of them must therefore be\r\nbased on the recollections of Frank Duryea, along with certain evidences\r\nseen on the engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 19.--UNDER SIDE of exhaust valve mechanism showing\r\nelectrical contacts that give spark only on every other revolution.]\r\n\r\nJust on top of the flywheel, and surrounding the crankshaft, rest two\r\nrings, 3-7/8 inches in diameter. Into the opposing surfaces of these\r\nrings are cut a series of small inclined planes, appertinent to each\r\nother. On the outer circumference of the upper ring two pins pass\r\nthrough a pair of lugs mounted in the flywheel, causing the ring to\r\nrotate with the flywheel, yet permitting vertical movement. Underneath,\r\nthe other ring is allowed to turn slightly when, by means of two\r\nconnecting links, the arms of the governor push against them. These two\r\narms, each constructed like a right angle and pivoted at the apex, are\r\narranged directly opposite each other far out in the flywheel recess. As\r\na weight on one angle of the arm presses outward by centrifugal force\r\nagainst a spring, the other angle presses inward against the connecting\r\nlink mentioned above. The turning of the lower set of inclined planes\r\nagainst the fixed set above raises the upper ring and the fork resting\r\non it. The upward movement of this fork, which is a continuation of an\r\narm pivoted to a bracket midway between the crankshaft and the slide\r\ncarrying the exhaust valve stop, causes the other end of the arm to\r\ndrop, pulling the slide down with it. In this manner the closing of the\r\nexhaust valve is blocked, preventing the intake of the next charge, and\r\ntherefore the engine misses one or more explosions until it slows to its\r\nnormal speed.\r\n\r\nA starting shaft is mounted above the engine casting by a cast-iron\r\nbracket on either end. The front end of the shaft has a bevel gear which\r\nis held by a coil spring behind the front bracket, just out of contact\r\nwith a bevel gear pressed onto the upper end of the crankshaft. The\r\nshort rear portion of the shaft is a tube which slides over the main\r\nshaft. Fitting the removable handcrank to the squared end of the hollow\r\nshaft and turning the crank clockwise, will advance the forward section\r\nof shaft through the medium of a pair of inclined collars. With the\r\nbevel gears now engaged the engine may be cranked. When ignition begins,\r\nthe inclined collars slide back down each other's surfaces, the shaft is\r\nagain shortened, and its bevel gear springs free of the one on the\r\ncrankshaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 20.--PISTON AND CONNECTING ROD of second engine.\r\nScrew on rod is where oil is poured into connecting rod to lubricate wrist\r\npin and crankshaft.]\r\n\r\nWhile Frank worked on his engine, he realized that certain parts of the\r\nold running gear would need to be altered or replaced. In view of the\r\nheavier and more powerful engine, he felt the old wheels, probably\r\nhaving compressed band hubs, were inadequate. He procured a set of new,\r\nheavier wheels[20] with Warner-type, cast-iron reinforced hubs. The\r\nangle iron frame, apparently sturdy enough to carry the added weight,\r\nwas retained, but it was decided to install a heavier rear axle.[21] The\r\nfront axle assembly was at first allowed to remain unchanged, as was the\r\nsteering apparatus. A short time later when the engine and friction\r\ntransmission were bolted in place on the running gear, Frank saw that\r\nthe rigidity of the framework had an undesirable effect. When the\r\nvehicle passed over any unevenness in the shop floor, the framework was\r\ndistorted and caused the jackshaft bearings to bind tightly enough on\r\nthe shaft to prevent its being turned by hand. In order to provide the\r\n3-point suspension necessary to eliminate this distortion, Frank\r\nattached the forward parts of the framework to an extra wooden spring\r\nbar, installing between this bar and the front axle a vertical fifth\r\nwheel of the type ordinarily used in a horizontal position in any light\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nFrank next calculated that with the faster running engine the speed of\r\nthe vehicle would be about 15 miles an hour, too much for the heavily\r\nloaded wheels. As he intended to make use of the original transmission,\r\nhe decided to decrease the speed by increasing the size of the friction\r\ndrum. He accomplished this by sliding a heavy fiber tube over the\r\noriginal drum, bringing its diameter to approximately 14 inches. The\r\noriginal shipper fork carriage was improved by separating the original\r\nbearings to a greater distance, and eliminating one of the two bearings\r\non one end. This permitted a smooth and free operation of the small\r\nsliding carriage.\r\n\r\nIn August 1893, possibly as a result of indoor experiments, Frank\r\ndiscovered that the chains running from the small 5-tooth[22] jackshaft\r\nsprockets to the large, bronze, wheel sprockets were tight at some times\r\nand loose at others. This caused considerable unnecessary noise. The\r\ndifficulty apparently was the result of the sprockets being cast and not\r\nmachined. The patternmaker had said he believed he could make the\r\npattern accurately enough so that no machining of the castings would be\r\nnecessary. Nice castings were produced, but \"these sprockets were the\r\nreason why an unusual construction was put on the crankshaft [meaning\r\njackshaft],\" explained Frank Duryea during an interview at the National\r\nMuseum on November 9, 1956. Elaborating further, in reply to the queries\r\nof E. A. Battison, of the Museum's division of engineering, Duryea told\r\nof the problem and the solution when he explained that the sprockets had\r\nplaces where the shrinkage was not even. The hot metal, contracting as\r\nit cooled, did not seem to contract uniformly, creating slightly unequal\r\ndistances between teeth. This resulted in the chain hanging quite loose\r\nin some places and in others the tightness prevented adjustment. He\r\ncontacted Will Russell, foreman of the Russell shop, where the\r\nautomobile was made, and Russell showed him a device, built by George\r\nWarwick, who had made the Warwick bicycle. It was an internal-cut gear,\r\naccording to Duryea's description, with sprocket teeth on its periphery.\r\nWith sprockets outside and normal teeth inside, the wheels were about 6\r\ninches in diameter, externally.\r\n\r\nThese little internal-gear sprockets were hung on double-shrouded\r\npinions secured to each end of the jackshaft. A solid disc or housing\r\nfitted against both ends of the pinion to prevent the internal gear\r\nfrom working off sideways. Duryea explained the function of these\r\nunique little parts: \"as soon as tension came on that ring gear that we\r\ntalked about, it not only tightened the chain hanging on this sprocket\r\non the upper side, but it tightened it on both sides. [The sprocket]\r\nrocks right out: both sides of the chain are tight.\"\r\n\r\nThis feature is one rarely encountered elsewhere, and Duryea, later in\r\nthe interview said, \"To tell you the truth, I think I was just a little\r\nbit ashamed about the thing, because I had to pull it off. I didn't like\r\nthe looks of it after I got it on.\"\r\n\r\nTwo small tanks, each with a capacity of approximately two gallons, were\r\nmounted over the engine in the positions they still occupy, the one on\r\nthe left for gasoline,[23] the other for water. The small fitting under\r\nthe gasoline tank has a thumbscrew shutoff and a glass-sight feed tube,\r\nleading to the carburetor. The water tank, an inch longer than the\r\ngasoline tank, communicates with the water jacket of the engine through\r\ntwo pieces of half-inch pipe, entering the jacket from above and below.\r\nThe overflow tank, holding just over a gallon, is suspended between the\r\nrear axle and the flywheel.\r\n\r\nA number of mufflers were constructed for the engine.[24] The first\r\nexperimental one was built of wood, being a box 6 × 6 × 15 inches with a\r\nhole for the exhaust pipe in one end and a series of small holes in the\r\nopposite end. Inside, Frank arranged metal plates which were somewhat\r\nshorter than the depth of the box. Every other one was attached to the\r\nbottom of the box; the intermediate plates were fastened to the top.\r\nThis contrivance muffled the sound considerably, but, as might be\r\nexpected, soon began to smoke. There can be little doubt that it was\r\nreplaced before any of the outdoor trials began. Another type consisted\r\nof a cylindrical metal shell, perhaps six inches in diameter and ten or\r\ntwelve inches long. Here a series of perforated baffle plates were\r\ninserted, with alternating solid plates having parts of their external\r\nedges cut away. Two bolts running the length of the muffler held on the\r\ncast-iron heads in a manner quite similar to the Model-T Ford mufflers\r\nof later years. Though partially satisfactory, Frank, in a November 6,\r\n1957, interview, complained that it made a metallic sound. Perhaps this\r\nwas the muffler he used from September to November 1893.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 21.--ILLUSTRATION OF THE NO. 2 SAMSON BATTERY used\r\nby the Duryeas in their vehicle. (Smithsonian photo 46858.)]\r\n\r\nOn August 28 Frank wrote to Charles saying the carriage was almost ready\r\nfor the road and that he hoped to take it out for a test on the coming\r\nSaturday, \"off somewhere so no one will see us....\"[25] There is no\r\nevidence showing whether the amount of remaining work permitted the\r\nproposed trial on September 2. The body was finally replaced on the\r\nrunning gear, at which time it was found necessary to raise the seat\r\ncushion several inches by the insertion of a framework made of old\r\ncrating boards. This allowed sufficient room between the seat and the\r\nframe to suspend the batteries and coil. Six no. 2 Samson batteries were\r\ncontained in this space, three on each side, in rows parallel to the\r\nside of the vehicle. The Samson battery consisted of a glass jar\r\ncontaining a solution of ammonia salts and water, with a carbon rod in\r\nthe center, housing a zinc rod. It is difficult to understand why they\r\nused Samson batteries rather than dry cells; perhaps they were concerned\r\nwith the mounting cost of the machine and were making use of parts\r\nalready on hand.[26] A coil, possibly from an old gaslight igniter\r\nsystem, accompanied the Samson batteries under the seat. This original\r\ncoil is now missing.\r\n\r\nThe iron dash frame, previously recovered and provided with a rain apron\r\nto be pulled up over the knees in the event a heavy rain blew in under\r\nthe carriage top, was bolted back in place. Frank and Mr. Markham gave\r\nthe carriage a quick painting; later Frank admitted, \"the machine never\r\nhad a good job of painting.\"[27] Before the motor wagon actually got\r\nonto the road, a reporter on the _Springfield Evening Union_ got some\r\nstatistics on it and an item appeared on September 16, giving the first\r\npublic notice of the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO USE FOR HORSES.\r\n\r\nSpringfield Mechanics Devise a New Mode of Travel.\r\n\r\nIngenious Wagon Now Being Made in This City for Which the Makers Claim\r\nGreat Things.\r\n\r\nA new motor carriage, which, if the preliminary tests prove successful\r\nas is expected, will revolutionize the mode of travel on highways, and\r\ndo away with the horse as a means of transportation, is being made in\r\nthis city. It is quite probable that within a short time one may be able\r\nto see an ordinary carriage in almost every respect, running along the\r\nstreets or climbing country hills without visible means of propulsion.\r\nThe carriage is being built by J. F. Duryea, the designer and B. F.\r\nMarkham, who have been at work on it for over a year. The vehicle was\r\ndesigned by C. E. Duryea, a bicycle manufacturer of Peoria, Ill., and he\r\ncommunicated his scheme to his brother, who is a practical machanic in\r\nthis city.\r\n\r\nThe propelling power is furnished by a two-horse power gasoline motor\r\nsituated near the rear axle and which, when started, runs continuously\r\nto the end of the trip, notwithstanding the number of times the carriage\r\nmay be stopped. The speed of the motor is uniform, being about 500\r\nrevolutions a minute, and is so arranged that it gives a multiplied\r\npower for climbing hills and the lower the rate of speed the greater\r\npower is furnished by the motor. The slowest that the carriage can be\r\ndriven is three miles an hour and the speed can be increased to fourteen\r\nor fifteen miles an hour. The power is transferred from the driving\r\nwheel of the motor, which runs horizontally with the main shaft by an\r\nendless friction belt running on a drum wheel. The belt is controlled by\r\na lever within easy reach of the driver and is shifted along the drum\r\nwheel to increase or decrease the speed. The driving wheel is about\r\ntwenty inches in diameter, having in its center a depression to which\r\nthe belt is shifted to stop the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe carriage can be reversed by shifting the belt from the end of the\r\ndrum, which gives the forward motion to the opposite side beyond the\r\ndepression in the driving wheel. The power which has been transferred to\r\nthe driving shaft from the motor is in turn transferred to the two rear\r\nwheels of the carriage by a combination gear and sprockets. An endless\r\nchain connects the sprockets on the carriage wheels to the sprocket\r\nwheels on the driving shaft. All of the motive power is located under\r\nthe body of an ordinary phaeton, the hight of which is not increased by\r\nthe machinery. The motor is started by a crank which is easily applied\r\nto a shaft in the rear of the carriage and the gasoline is ignited in\r\nthe cylinder by electricity. An automatic device stops the flow of\r\ngasoline into the cylinder when the motor ceases running. The gasoline\r\nis carried in tanks, which hold about two gallons, and which will run\r\nthe carriage for about eight hours. The wagon is guided by a bicycle\r\nbar, and the speed is also controlled by this bar.\r\n\r\nThe method employed in this is as follows: To start the carriage press\r\nthe lever down; to reverse it throw the lever up and to guide the wagon\r\nturn the lever either to the right or left. The front axle instead of\r\nturning horizontally plays up and down, in order that the machinery may\r\nbe on a level with the rear wheels, while the front wheels are set on\r\nthe axle by a pivotal joint and are connected with the guiding lever by\r\nbars with ball bearings. The carriage complete weighs about 220 pounds,\r\nand the essential features are already covered by patents while others\r\nare pending.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the carriages can be sold for about $400, and a\r\nstock company will probably be formed to manufacture them.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 22.--FROM THE _Springfield Evening Union_, September 16, 1893.]\r\n\r\nToward the latter part of the following week, Frank was ready to give\r\nthe product of his labors its first road trial. On September 21 the\r\ncompleted carriage was rolled onto the elevator at Russell's shop.\r\nSeeing that the running gear was too long for the elevator, they raised\r\nthe front of the machine, resting the entire weight of 750 pounds on the\r\nrear wheels. Once outside the building, they pushed it into an area\r\nbetween the Russell and Stacy buildings. After dark, \"so no one will\r\nsee,\" Will Bemis, Mr. Markham's son-in-law, brought a horse and they\r\npulled the phaeton out to his barn on Spruce Street.[28] There, on\r\nSpruce and Florence Streets the first tests were made. The next day\r\nFrank wrote his brother saying, \"Have tried it (the carriage) finally\r\nand thoroughly and quit trying until some changes are made. Belt\r\ntransmission very bad.[29] Engine all right.\" He did admit the engine\r\nseemed to be well loaded most of the time. He also had an idea in mind\r\nto replace the poor transmission, explaining the plan to Charles: \"The\r\nthree gears[30] on secondary shaft have friction clutches, the two bevel\r\ngears on same shaft are controlled by a clutch which frees one and\r\nclutches the other at will. This provides a reverse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRIMARY SPARK COILS.\r\n\r\n FOR ELECTRIC GAS LIGHTING.\r\n\r\n Cat.

This report, too, commented on the faulty transmission and the\r\nplan already in Frank's mind for the new transmission.\r\n\r\n     ... The friction belt allowed of the speed being steadily increased\r\n     or diminished at the will of the driver and caused no sudden\r\n     forward motion of the carriage, but while this arrangement has many\r\n     advantages it uses up the power so that the two-horse power\r\n     furnished by the motor [somewhat less than the rating Frank gave\r\n     the engine] was reduced to less than three-fourths horse power on\r\n     reaching the main shaft. This would not be sufficient to propel the\r\n     carriage up steep grades but would be sufficient to run the\r\n     carriage on level road.\r\n\r\n     The inventors will do away with this belt in favor of a clamp gear\r\n     and will make the drum wheel smaller. By this means there will be\r\n     very little power lost in transmission to the shaft and by a\r\n     patented arrangement the carriage may be started gradually but the\r\n     speed must be increased by shifting the clamp gear to a succession\r\n     of gears on the driving wheel of the motor. The speed of the\r\n     carriage will be fixed permanently according to the size of the\r\n     gear that the smaller one is shifted to. The test of the machine\r\n     with the gear arrangement will be made soon.\r\n\r\nIn October Frank decided on another vacation and went to Chicago to see\r\nthe Columbian Exposition. Charles had come up from Peoria to see the\r\nfair and the two talked over the progress on their motor wagon, and\r\ndiscussed the transmission problem. They gave particular attention to\r\neverything relating to engines and motor carriages, and Frank recalls\r\nseeing a Daimler quadricycle that impressed him with its performance.[31]\r\nJust what decisions the two might have made there are unknown, yet it is\r\nlikely that they agreed to give the old transmission one more chance to\r\nprove itself.\r\n\r\nReturning to Springfield, probably in the first week of November, Frank\r\ngave the friction drive its final test, this time substituting a leather\r\nbelt for the rubber one first used.[32] Mr. Markham, though intensely\r\ninterested in the experiments, apparently was dubious concerning the\r\nsafety of the carriage. It had no brakes, and fearing failure of the\r\ntransmission on a downgrade, he was reluctant to ride in the machine. On\r\nNovember 9 he asked Will Bemis to try it for him. The following day the\r\n_Springfield Morning Union_ gave a description of the run:\r\n\r\n     Residents in the vicinity of Florence street flocked to the windows\r\n     yesterday afternoon astonished to see gliding by in the roadway a\r\n     common top carriage with no shafts and no horse attached. The\r\n     vehicle is operated by gasoline and is the invention of Erwin\r\n     Markham and J. F. Duryea. It has been previously described in The\r\n     Union and the trial yesterday was simply to ascertain the practical\r\n     value of a leather friction surface which has been substituted for\r\n     the rubber one previously used. The vehicle, which was operated by\r\n     Mr. Bemis, started from the corner of Hancock avenue and Spruce\r\n     street and went up the avenue, up Hancock street and started down\r\n     Florence street, working finely, but when about half-way down the\r\n     latter street it stopped short, refusing to move. Investigation\r\n     showed that the bearing had been worn smooth by the friction and a\r\n     little water sprinkled upon it put it in running condition again.\r\n     The rest of the trip was made down Florence and down Spruce street,\r\n     to the residence of the inventors. They hope to have the vehicle in\r\n     good working condition soon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 24.--RUNNING GEAR OF DURYEA VEHICLE, showing the\r\nsecond engine and other parts as used in January 1894.]\r\n\r\nThe same evening, the late edition ran a brief paragraph stating that\r\n\"the test was made to determine the value of a leather friction surface\r\nfor propelling the wagon, that had been substituted in place of the\r\nrubber surface, used in the former test.\" Bemis, according to Frank\r\nDuryea's recollection, was not impressed with the performance of the\r\nmachine, saying \"the thing is absolutely useless,\" and for a time it\r\nappeared that further support from Markham would not be forthcoming.\r\nFrank, believing eventual success to be near, drew up plans showing his\r\ngeared transmission, and with these managed to gain Markham's partial\r\nsupport. Money for material and use of the shop was to continue, but\r\nFrank was to complete the work on his own time.\r\n\r\nNow receiving no salary, Frank worked hurriedly on the transmission\r\nthroughout late November, December, and the first two weeks of January.\r\nFirst discarding the old friction drum and shaft, and the shipper-fork\r\ncarriage, he bolted a rawhide bevel gear to the lower surface of the\r\nflywheel. This turns two bevel gears, in opposite directions, on a\r\ncountershaft directly underneath, approximately in the position of the\r\nold jackshaft. The right bevel gear is secured to the main countershaft\r\non which two clutches are mounted, one on each side of the crankshaft.\r\nOn a sleeve turning freely around the countershaft is mounted the\r\nreverse bevel gear and clutch. Three free-running clutch drums, the\r\nright one carrying the high-speed gear, the two on the left carrying the\r\ncombination low speed and reverse gear between them, complete the\r\ncountershaft assembly. The clutch assemblies are of Frank Duryea's\r\ndesign, having internal arms, expanding outward to press leather-faced\r\nshoes against the inner surface of the drum, thus securing the drum and\r\nits gear to the shaft. Behind this machinery is the jackshaft with its\r\nsmall differential on the right, two laminated rawhide gears[33] meshing\r\nwith the iron gears of the countershaft, and the internal-gear sprockets\r\nhanging on the small pinions at either end. A sliding cam bar, mounted\r\nnearly in the position of the former shipper-fork carriage, is operated\r\nby the vertical movement of the tiller handle to engage any one of the\r\nthree clutches. With the tiller depressed, the vehicle is in reverse.\r\nElevating it slightly puts it into low gear, and raising it still higher\r\nruns the machine at its highest speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 25.--HALF OF JACKSHAFT, showing rawhide gears,\r\ndouble shrouded pinion and half of the Columbia differential.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 26.--HALF OF JACKSHAFT showing double-shrouded\r\npinion and half of the Columbia differential.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 27.--CAM BAR IN FOREGROUND, operated by tiller,\r\nactuates the various clutches of the transmission.

Serial No. 509,466. (No model.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To all whom it may concern_:\r\n\r\n  Be it known that I, CHARLES E. DURYEA, a\r\n  citizen of the United States, residing at Peoria,\r\n  in the county of Peoria and State of Illinois,\r\n  have invented new and useful Improvements                     5\r\n  in Road-Vehicles, of which the following is a\r\n  specification.\r\n\r\n  The object of this invention is to produce a\r\n  road vehicle which shall be self-propelled, not\r\n  unduly heavy, simple and easy of control and                 10\r\n  comparatively inexpensive, together with\r\n  such minor objects as will become hereinafter\r\n  apparent.\r\n\r\n  The invention more particularly relates to\r\n  the construction and arrangement of parts for                15\r\n  constituting the driving gearing and to the\r\n  means for controlling the action thereof; to\r\n  an improved manner of mounting the front,\r\n  or steering, wheels upon the front axle, and\r\n  of mounting the said axle relative to the running            20\r\n  gear frame, and to the means for effecting\r\n  the steering; to the appliances for the support\r\n  of the motor and driving mechanism in\r\n  an advantageous and efficient manner, and,\r\n  generally, to improved and simplified details                25\r\n  of construction throughout the vehicle, all as\r\n  will hereinafter be rendered more apparent,\r\n  and the invention consists in constructions\r\n  and combinations of parts, all substantially\r\n  as will hereinafter fully appear and be set                  30\r\n  forth in the claims.\r\n\r\n  Reference is to be had to the accompanying\r\n  drawings, in which--\r\n\r\n  Figure 1 is a sectional elevation from front\r\n  to rear of the improved road-vehicle. Fig. 2 is              35\r\n  a plan view of the running and driving gear,\r\n  the vehicle-body being understood as removed.\r\n  Fig. 3 is a front elevation of the vehicle. Fig.\r\n  4 is a perspective view of the support and suspension\r\n  devices for the driving mechanism.                           40\r\n  Fig. 5 is a vertical sectional view, longitudinally,\r\n  through the shiftable driving-gear, the\r\n  controlling devices employed in conjunction\r\n  with this mechanism being seen in side elevation.\r\n  Figs. 6 and 7 show the above-mentioned                       45\r\n  controlling devices as in operative relations\r\n  differing the one from the other and\r\n  also from that of Fig. 5.\r\n\r\n  Similar letters of reference indicate corresponding\r\n  parts in all of the views.                                   50\r\n\r\n  The parts will now be described in detail\r\n  with reference to said drawings, and A represents\r\n  the body which is spring supported\r\n  on the frame, B, of the running gear. This\r\n  frame, as shown, is rectangular, and has the                 55\r\n  body-supporting springs, B{2}, similar to those\r\n  found in common carriages. This frame has,\r\n  affixed thereto, at its rear ends, sleeves, _a_, _a_,\r\n  which loosely embrace the rear wheel axle, D,\r\n  which is the driven axle of the vehicle. The                 60\r\n  axle, E, for the front wheels is centrally secured\r\n  to the running gear frame, B, by the\r\n  horizontal king-bolt, _b_, whereby such axle\r\n  may have a swinging movement relative to\r\n  the frame in a vertical plane, but it has no                 65\r\n  swinging movement horizontally, the wheels\r\n  being swivel-mounted on the ends of this axle\r\n  peculiarly, as will shortly hereinafter be set\r\n  forth.\r\n\r\n  The body, as shown, is in the form of an                     70\r\n  inverted box, the motor, H, and driving gear\r\n  being accommodated within the downwardly\r\n  opening inclosure constituted thereby, and\r\n  the body also has the upwardly open box-like\r\n  forward extension, or pit, A{2}, for the accommodation       75\r\n  of the feet of the rider, the rider's\r\n  seat being constituted by the top forward portion\r\n  of the box body. Some other suitable\r\n  design of body may, of course, be used in lieu\r\n  of this one shown.                                           80\r\n\r\n  The front wheels, _d_, _d_, are hung to the front\r\n  axle, E, so that the center of each wheel base\r\n  is in a line coincident with the axis of the pivotal\r\n  connection which is provided between the\r\n  journals for the wheels and the axle, which                  85\r\n  arrangement practically destroys any tendency\r\n  to deflection from the course that might\r\n  otherwise arise from striking an obstacle,\r\n  and so renders the steering easier. In order\r\n  to effect this the axle is formed with yoked                 90\r\n  ends, the yoke members, _f_, _f_, being above and\r\n  below the longitudinal line of the axle. The\r\n  short journal, _g_, shown for each wheel, has at\r\n  its inner end an upwardly and downwardly\r\n  extended arm, _h_, which is return-bent to be                95\r\n  loosely embraced by the axle yoke, _f_, _f_. The\r\n  cone pointed screws, _c_, passed through the\r\n  yoke members, _f_, and into sockets therefor in\r\n  the arms, _h_, of the journals, _g_, constitute the\r\n  means for the swivel connection between said                100\r\n  parts. The lock-nuts, _c_{2}, manifestly, are employed\r\n  with utility in this connection.\r\n\r\n  It will be perceived that inasmuch as in the\r\n  arrangement shown, the pivotal connections\r\n\r\n\r\n (No Model.)      4 Sheets--Sheet 2.\r\n\r\n  C.

He had\r\nconsiderable doubt whether the narrow iron tires would have enough\r\ntraction to move the phaeton. Soon he devised an expedient for this\r\nsituation, communicating to Charles on December 22 that he was \"having\r\nJack Swaine [a local blacksmith] make a couple of clutch rims so we can\r\nget over this snow and ice.... Our detachable rims referred to will be\r\nof 1/8 iron 1-3/4 wide and drawn together at one point by two screws,\r\none on either side of felloe. It will be studded with calks in two\r\nrows.\"[34]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 29.--MR. AND MRS. FRANK DURYEA examining vehicle\r\nin the Smithsonian Institution before restoration.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 18, 1894, was a day of triumph for Frank Duryea. Writing Charles\r\nabout his success the next day he said, \"Took out carriage again last\r\nnight and gave it another test about 9 o'clock.\" The only difficulty he\r\nmentioned was a slight irregularity in the engine, caused by the tiny\r\nleather pad in the exhaust-valve mechanism falling out.[35] Speaking of\r\nthis trip, Frank recalled in 1956:\r\n\r\n     When I got this car ready to run one night, I took it out and I had\r\n     a young fellow with me; I thought I might need him to help push in\r\n     case the car didn't work.... We ran from the area of the shop where\r\n     it was built down on Taylor Street. We started out and ran up\r\n     Worthington Street hill,[36] on top of what you might call \"the\r\n     Bluff\" in Springfield. Then we drove along over level roads from\r\n     there to the home of Mr. Markham who lived with his son-in-law,\r\n     Will Bemis, and there we refilled this tank with water. [At this\r\n     point he was asked if it was pretty well emptied by then.] Yes, I\r\n     said in my account of it that when we got up there the water was\r\n     boiling furiously. Well, no doubt it was. We refilled it and then\r\n     we turned it back and drove down along the Central Street hill and\r\n     along Maple, crossed into State Street, dropped down to Dwight,\r\n     went west along Dwight to the vicinity where we had a shed that we\r\n     could put the car in for the night. During that trip we had run, I\r\n     think, just about six miles, maybe a little bit more. That was the\r\n     first trip with this vehicle. It was the first trip of anything\r\n     more than a few hundred yards that the car had ever made.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DURYEA AUTOMOBILE\r\n  BUILT BY J. F. AND C. E.

BALUNEK]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Frank could give demonstration rides with the motor carriage, hoping\r\nto encourage more investors to back future work. Cautious Mr. Markham\r\nfinally got his ride, though Frank had to assure him that the engine of\r\nthe brakeless vehicle would hold them back on any hill they would\r\ndescend. The carriage on which he had spent so many hours was to see\r\nlittle use after that. Its total mileage is probably less than a hundred\r\nmiles. Little additional work is known to have been performed on the\r\ncarriage after January 1894; there is, however, a letter[37] Frank sent\r\nhis brother on January 19 which tells of contemplated muffler\r\nimprovements. Another message was dispatched to Charles on March 22,\r\nmentioning the good performance of the phaeton on Harrison Avenue\r\nhill.[38] This was possibly the last run of the machine, for no further\r\nreferences have been discovered.\r\n\r\nFrank spent the months of February and March in preparing drawings, some\r\nof which accompanied their first patent application,[39] while others\r\nwere to be used in the construction of an improved, 2-cylinder carriage.\r\nWork on the new machine started in April. The old phaeton, in the\r\nabsence of used-car lots, was put into storage in the Bemis barn.[40]\r\nLater, on the formation of the Duryea Motor Wagon Company in 1895, it\r\nwas removed to the barn of D. A. Reed, treasurer of the company.[41]\r\nThere it remained until 1920, when it was obtained by Inglis M.

How the shipper fork might have\r\n        handled two belts is not understood.\r\n\r\n  [30]  As actually constructed there are only two gears on the secondary\r\n        shaft. He obviously discovered that one gear secured to two\r\n        clutches would serve for both forward and reverse.

Copies in Museum files.\r\n\r\n  [35]  Telling of the first use of the car in later days, Frank Duryea\r\n        mentions the many noises and vibrations that accompanied the\r\n        trip: the vibrating tiller, the tinny sounding muffler, the\r\n        clattering chains. He later reported speeds of 3 mph in low gear\r\n        and 8 mph in high gear.\r\n\r\n  [36]  Letter from Frank Duryea to Charles Duryea, Jan. 19, 1894, says\r\n        they went up hill via Summer and Armor Streets, then out Walnut\r\n        to Bemis' at Central Street School.\r\n\r\n  [37]  The letter read: \"I have designed a new muffler and we will\r\n        proceed to make it before long, in a day or two. Instead of one\r\n        shell 1/8-inch thick I shall put a shell 1/16-inch thick inside\r\n        another of equal thickness, but about 1 inch greater diameter\r\n        i.e., one chamber within another so as to cause sound to turn\r\n        corners to get out. Still another shell will be added if it\r\n        prove insufficient, making it turn about again--taking care in\r\n        each case to give ample room for expansion--outer one need not\r\n        be more than 1/32 inch possibly. Will let two threaded rods with\r\n        nuts hold heads on both or on three cases, if the 3d be\r\n        essential.\"\r\n\r\n  [38]  This letter gives further proof that the car never had a brake.\r\n        Frank said the car came back down the hill with no brake, but\r\n        that the engine held the vehicle back.\r\n\r\n  [39]  DURYEA, op. cit. (footnote 5), p. 37.\r\n\r\n  [40]  It is possible that a few parts were removed at this time to be\r\n        used on the two-cylinder car. The muffler may have been one of\r\n        these, and even more likely, the governor parts. Charles Duryea\r\n        wrote to C. W. Mitman December 27, 1921, stating that his\r\n        younger brother Otho and a Henry Wells had put in a battery and\r\n        gasoline in 1897 and started the engine. Because the chains were\r\n        not on the car they could not attempt to operate it; but the\r\n        engine ran too fast, and finally something broke, probably the\r\n        engine frame, found to be broken during the recent restoration.\r\n        Charles thought the engine ran too fast because some of the\r\n        governor parts were already missing.\r\n\r\n  [41]  Recorded interview with Frank Duryea in the U.S. National Museum,\r\n        November 9, 1956.

The result of their collaboration is\r\n     the unique, astronomical timepiece now in the Museum of History\r\n     and Technology._\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR: _Silvio A. Bedini is curator of mechanical and\r\n     civil engineering in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of\r\n     History and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"... All this work I had performed eagerly, so that, while in\r\n     my room, I might contemplate leisurely, both during the day and\r\n     in the night, the true face of the heavens and of the seas\r\n     unobscured by clouds, even though I had no astronomical\r\n     equipment.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWith these words, Father Francesco Borghesi (1723-1802) of Mechel\r\ndescribed the reasons which inspired him to invent a unique astronomical\r\nclock which is now in the horological collection of the Museum of\r\nHistory and Technology.\r\n\r\nThis complicated mechanism, which performs a multitude of functions, was\r\ndesigned by Father Francesco Borghesi, a secular priest in Venezia\r\nTridentina. It was constructed in 1764 under his direction by a\r\nprovincial clockmaker named Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla (1702-1789) of\r\nMocenigo di Rumo. It was the second of two complicated astronomical\r\nclocks which Father Borghesi designed and which Bertolla constructed.\r\nAccording to contemporary sources, this clock was presented to the\r\nEmpress Maria Theresa of Austria soon after its completion.\r\n\r\nIts history is rather hazy, except for the fact that in 1780 this second\r\nBorghesi timepiece was still in the Imperial Palace in Vienna. The clock\r\nwas again noted in 1927 when it was sold at a public auction in New\r\nYork.[2] Subsequently, it was acquired for the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Astronomical Clocks\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the great theoretical and mechanical achievement which\r\nthe Borghesi clock represents has been most adequately covered\r\nelsewhere.[3] Consideration of the development of equation and\r\nastronomical clocks is required here only for the purpose of relating\r\nthe Borghesi timepiece with the other significant developments in this\r\nbranch of horology.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the anchor escapement in about 1670, and the consequent\r\ngreater accuracy in time-telling, led to increased preoccupation with\r\nprecision. Daily differences in time as recorded by sundials and clocks\r\nbecame more noticeable. Finally, in the second half of the 17th century,\r\nsome attempt was made to construct mechanical clocks combined with\r\nsundials as well as astronomical clocks.\r\n\r\nWith the improvement of precision time-telling, it became necessary to\r\nreconcile the actual difference between true and mean time. Although a\r\ngreat variety of time-equation tables were produced, there was a\r\nconsiderable margin for error in their use. This led to the construction\r\nof mechanical clocks in which the equation of time was automatically\r\naccomplished. A few were produced late in the 17th and early 18th\r\ncentury at considerable cost and, consequently, with little popularity.\r\nEquation sundials were also developed which were elaborately ingenious,\r\nbut they were not completely practical. Inevitably, they were supplanted\r\nby the mechanical equation clock.\r\n\r\nProbably the first documented mention of an equation clock is in the\r\ndiary of John Evelyn who recorded that in 1666 he visited the Royal\r\nSociety where he witnessed a curious clock, which showed the equation of\r\ntime, being presented by a certain Mercator. More data on the subject\r\nappeared in the first two decades of the 18th century, when Henry Sully,\r\nJoseph Williamson, Daniel Quare, and Thomas Tompion--who were among the\r\nforemost English clockmakers of all time--produced elaborate examples of\r\nthese timepieces. Another significant maker was Dowe Williamson, who\r\nbecame Court Clockmaker to Emperor Charles VI of Austria. In London,\r\nJoseph Williamson produced some of the finest astronomical timepieces of\r\nthis type that have been known. The interest in the subject next shifted\r\nto France where many fine examples were produced during the first half\r\nof the 18th century.\r\n\r\nJust after the middle of the 18th century, the subject of astronomical\r\nclocks suddenly became a major horological preoccupation in another\r\nregion, namely, Austria, where the work in this field was apparently\r\ndone exclusively by members of the clergy. The earliest was Father\r\nPhilipp Matthäus Hahn (1739-1790) of Württemberg.[4] Father Hahn\r\nconsidered the equation of time as only one part of a plan to represent\r\nastronomical occurrences by means of clockwork. In addition to\r\nplanetaria and similar mechanisms, Father Hahn produced two\r\nextraordinary astronomical, tall-case clocks, both of which survive in\r\npublic museums.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nThe author wishes to acknowledge the valuable assistance received from\r\nthe following: DR.

The\r\nthird cleric was Brother David à San Cajetano (1736-1796) in the same\r\nAugustine order to which Father Aurelianus belonged. He achieved note as\r\nthe author of various publications, including _Neue Rädergebäude_[6]\r\n[New Construction of Wheels] relating to planet-wheels, or gear-trains\r\ncontaining epicyclic elements. He constructed a clock based on an\r\nelaborate astronomical design which was substantially different from the\r\nothers. The fourth of the ecclesiasts who designed astronomical clocks\r\nin this period was Father Klein of Prague, who produced a complicated\r\nastronomical timepiece in about 1738.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such important and outstanding examples of astronomical\r\nclocks were produced exclusively by ecclesiasts in Austria during the\r\nsecond half of the 18th century is especially significant. It is\r\nparticularly so when a fifth cleric is added to the group, also an\r\nAustrian subject although Italian by heritage, in the person of Father\r\nFrancesco Borghesi.\r\n\r\nAlthough only Father Borghesi's second astronomical clock is now known,\r\nit is apparent that this example in the Museum of History and Technology\r\nrepresents an experiment in astronomical time-telling comparable to any\r\nof the timepieces produced by Father Hahn, Father Aurelianus, Brother\r\nDavid à San Cajetano or Father Klein.\r\n\r\nThis combination of five clerical clockmakers who lived in the same\r\nregion during the same period of time is sufficiently unusual. However,\r\nthe fact that each of them apparently worked without association with\r\nany of the others leads to the conjecture that a common factor must have\r\nled them to their individual preoccupation with astronomical horology.\r\nWhat the link may have been is not apparent from the surviving records\r\nof the lives and works of these clerics. Certainly it was not an\r\ninterest in astronomy or clockmaking per se, because other than the\r\nastronomical clocks, none of these horological inventors--with the\r\npossible exception of Father Hahn--worked in any other aspect of the\r\nfields of astronomy or horology. However, after a comprehensive study of\r\nFather Borghesi's writings, there is little doubt of the religious basis\r\nof his own inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigner Borghesi\r\n\r\n\r\nFather Borghesi's story takes place in the picturesque mountainous\r\nregion of what was then known as Venezia Tridentina (since 1947,\r\nTrentino-Alto Adige) in northern Italy, along the Tyrolean border of\r\nAustria. Because of its strategic position as the passage between\r\nInnsbruck and Verona, the possession of the Tridentina was contested\r\nagain and again in the European wars, but during Father Borghesi's\r\nlifetime, the Tridentina was under Austrian domination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--PANORAMA of the village of Mechel in the\r\nvalley of the Non, birthplace of Father Borghesi.]\r\n\r\nDeep within this mountainous district is the romantic valley of the Non,\r\nor Anáuni, with its great forests and ancient castles. Most maps do not\r\nmark it, and the tourist guides ignore it.[7] One of the chief\r\ncommunities is Cles, with its historic Renaissance buildings. The major\r\ncity of the region is Trent on the Adige River, with its surviving Roman\r\nrelics and Romanesque and Renaissance architecture.\r\n\r\nThe little villages scattered throughout the valley of the Non played no\r\npart in history, but such names as Mechel and Mocenigo di Rumo reflect\r\nthe interchange of sovereignty. It was in the little village of Mechel\r\nthat Francesco Borghesi was born in 1723.[8] Local records are meager\r\nand inadequate, and many of the details of Borghesi's life must be\r\nassumed. Inasmuch as the village was in a rural, agricultural district,\r\nBorghesi may have come from a family of farmers, vintners, or village\r\ntradesmen. Borghesi sought an education by entering the priesthood and\r\nwas ordained a secular priest in Salzburg. He was first assigned as\r\ncurate to the village parish of Rumo in the valley of the Non, a short\r\ndistance from his birthplace.[9] Later, he was transferred to his native\r\nMechel. He was inherently a man of simple tastes and of great piety. He\r\ntended to the needs of his mountain villagers and attended the births,\r\nweddings and deaths of his parishioners. It was during his assignment in\r\nthis tiny community that Father Borghesi met and became friendly with\r\nthe clockmaker, Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla of nearby Mocenigo di Rumo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClockmaker Bertolla\r\n\r\n\r\nBartolomeo Antonio Bertolla was born in Mocenigo di Rumo, a short\r\ndistance from Mechel, in 1702.[10] Nothing is known of his boyhood,\r\nother than the fact that he was mechanically inclined. At the age of 17\r\nhe was apprenticed to become a clockmaker with the master, Johann Georg\r\nButzjäger of Neulengbach, a small village on the edge of the great\r\nVienna woods.[11] This region was then part of the domain of the\r\nArchduke of Austria, of which Sankt Pölten was the capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--PORTRAIT OF BARTOLOMEO ANTONIO BERTOLLA,\r\nclockmaker, of Mocenigo di Rumo. The canvas in oils is owned by\r\ndescendants. In the upper left-hand corner is an inscription, now hardly\r\nlegible, indicating that the portrait may have been painted after\r\nBertolla's death on January 15, 1789. Translated, it states: \"Bartolomeo\r\nAntonio Bertola [sic] Celebrated Mechanician and Inventor of various\r\nInstruments. Repairer of the clocks of Venice, Verona, Trent, and other\r\nlocalities. Maker of the Work which combines the Copernican and\r\nPtolemaic Systems devised by Father Francesco Borghesi of Mechel,\r\nLaureate Mathematician, and humbly offered to Her Imperial Majesty Maria\r\nTheresa. Died in piety in his home at Rumo on 15 January 1789 at the age\r\nof 86.\" (_Courtesy of Sig. Luigi Pippa of Milan._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--THE VILLAGE OF MOCENIGO DI RUMO in the valley\r\nof the Non. Arrow points to Bertolla's home and workshop at far left.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--CERTIFICATE OF APPRENTICESHIP awarded to\r\nBartolomeo Antonio Bertolla upon completion of his 3-year apprenticeship\r\nat Neulengbach, dated December 27, 1722.]\r\n\r\nBertolla began his apprenticeship with Butzjäger under the auspices of\r\nthe Corporation of Blacksmiths of Sankt Pölten in 1719. His training was\r\nsupervised by two master locksmiths, Johann Christian Winz and Peter\r\nWisshofer, who were members of the Corporation, and were assigned to\r\nserve as patrons for the apprentice. It was their obligation to make\r\ncertain that he received good care and adequate instruction from his\r\nmaster. While he worked in Butzjäger's shop, Bertolla lived with the\r\nmaster's family in their home.\r\n\r\nBertolla's 3 years at Neulengbach passed quickly as he sought to absorb\r\nall that his master could teach him. Butzjäger was considered to be a\r\ngood craftsman in the region, yet today there is not even a mention of\r\nhis name in the lists of clockmakers. He specialized in the production\r\nand repair of \"great clocks\" which included tall-case, domestic\r\ntimepieces, and tower clocks. Butzjäger treated his apprentice well, and\r\nin return Bertolla rewarded him by being diligent and honest. His\r\nsubsequent work is sufficient indication that he developed into an\r\nextremely skilled craftsman, and he became the equal of any clockmaker\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\nThe 3 years of apprenticeship were completed and on December 27, 1722,\r\nBertolla received a certificate from the Corporation of Blacksmiths\r\nwhich assured whomever it might concern of Bertolla's skill, diligence\r\nand honesty, and permitted him to open his own shop as a clockmaker\r\nunder the auspices of the Corporation. This document, which has been\r\npreserved by Bertolla's descendants, is an interesting record of the\r\norganization of the trade guilds in the 18th century, and, for that\r\nreason, has been translated from the original German:\r\n\r\n     We, the Superiors and other masters of the honorable\r\n     corporation of municipal blacksmiths, armorers, and of smiths,\r\n     in the Imperial City of St. Pölten in Austria by the river\r\n     Enns, DECLARE BY THESE PRESENTS put in force by this document\r\n     to anyone who waits to hear.... That the honorable and able\r\n     BARTOLOMEO ANTONIO BERTOLLA of Rumo in Lentzberg, the Tyrol, on\r\n     the 27th day of the month of December of the year 1719 was\r\n     consigned as apprentice for three years, in the presence of two\r\n     sponsoring masters for the purpose, the honorable Johann\r\n     Christian Winz and Peter Wisshofer, both of them master\r\n     locksmiths representing the entire honorable Corporation and\r\n     others of open shop--to the honorable JOHANN GEORG BUTZJÄGER,\r\n     incorporated with us, citizen and master clockmaker for large\r\n     clocks in the merchant-village of Neulengbach in Wienerwald, as\r\n     his master of the art, would have therefore perfectly and\r\n     rightfully worked and learned, and\r\n\r\n     that afterwards, on the day and year noted at the bottom, he\r\n     will be newly declared free and independent before us,\r\n     representative of an entire and honorable Corporation and with\r\n     open shop, of his above-mentioned master and of the two\r\n     sponsoring masters mentioned,\r\n\r\n     and since he eagerly requested a truthful certificate of\r\n     apprenticeship for his honest service as an apprentice and for\r\n     his good behavior, and we having great pleasure as well as the\r\n     duty of favoring the truth and well knowing that the aforesaid\r\n     BARTOLOMEO ANTONIO BERTOLLA has learned honestly the art of\r\n     clockmaking for great clocks from his aforesaid master, and\r\n     that he has always behaved with honesty, obedience,\r\n     faithfulness and diligence both towards his master and towards\r\n     us to our complete satisfaction and, therefore, we cannot in\r\n     any manner refuse his request, rather we wish to grant it with\r\n     a clear conscience.\r\n\r\n     WE THEREFORE ADDRESS TO EVERYONE and to anyone in whatever\r\n     state and rank, but particularly to those interested in our\r\n     branch of this art, our respectful and courteous entreaty and\r\n     request to consider BARTOLOMEO ANTONIO BERTOLLA well\r\n     recommended for his honest apprenticeship and his good\r\n     behavior, and to desire to favor him in every way, in such a\r\n     manner that will assure our gratitude whenever an occasion\r\n     presents itself.\r\n\r\n     For this purpose, we issue, as we have declared we wish to\r\n     issue to you, BARTOLOMEO ANTONIO BERTOLLA, this certificate of\r\n     apprenticeship, attaching to it the seal of our Corporation.\r\n\r\n     Executed in the city of St. Pölten on 27 December 1722.[12]\r\n\r\nHis apprenticeship over, Bertolla returned to his native region where he\r\nsoon established a reputation for himself as one of the most skillful\r\nclockmakers in the Tridentina and produced timepieces of fine quality in\r\nsome quantity. No records have survived concerning his personal life,\r\nbut it is believed that he married probably soon after his return. He\r\nhad no children of his own. To expand his business, he eventually took\r\ninto his shop two nephews, the sons of a brother and a sister, as\r\napprentices.\r\n\r\nBertolla's work brought him a sufficient number of clients, and he\r\nproduced elaborate clocks for his more wealthy patrons.\r\n\r\nIn 1752, it is recorded that he repaired the great clock in the\r\ncampanile of the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Cles,\r\nthe regional capital of the valley of the Non. The clock dated probably\r\nfrom the 16th century, and it seems likely that Bertolla replaced the\r\noriginal two-wheel train with a three-wheel movement, and that he added\r\nthe present anchor escapement.[13]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to determine when Father Borghesi first made\r\nBertolla's acquaintance, but it may be assumed that they had become\r\nfriends in the late 1750's.\r\n\r\nAfter he had come to know Bertolla, Father Borghesi apparently spent\r\nmany hours in the clockmaker's shop. He was fascinated by mechanics in\r\nany form, and the complications of clockwork particularly intrigued him.\r\nBertolla was patient with the young priest, explaining the tools he had\r\nand their uses, the clocks he produced or repaired, and the principles\r\nwhich were involved. Father Borghesi listened willingly and as his\r\nunderstanding of timepieces grew, his curiosity increased.\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself, the priest could not be satisfied with the ordinary\r\naspects of his friend's work and wanted to learn more. From a casual\r\npastime, the study of time became an obsession with him. There was but\r\none recourse: he went back to studying once again. This time it was not\r\ntheology, however, but the sciences. Every moment he could spare went\r\ninto the perusal of books on mathematics, astronomy, and associated\r\nsubjects. He progressed rapidly, driven by his overpowering interest and\r\naided by his quick intellect.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, Borghesi managed to acquire the basic texts that\r\nexplained this new world to him, probably borrowing them from old\r\nseminary friends. As each new book came into his hands, he devoured it\r\nin his desire to master its contents. He discussed each new principle or\r\nprecept that he learned with Bertolla. Together, they attempted to apply\r\nhis new learning to the calculations necessary for a timepiece which\r\nwould demonstrate the astronomical theories in visual form. Borghesi\r\ntaught himself slowly, step by step, and the result was a profound\r\nunderstanding of astronomical science. He conceived the project of\r\nconstructing a great astronomical clock which he felt could be\r\naccomplished by combining Bertolla's mechanical skills with his own\r\nrecent mastery of astronomy and mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Borghesi Clock\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to visualize the two men, the priest and the\r\nclockmaker, as they sat together night after night working out their\r\nplans. Father Borghesi would painstakingly outline the astronomical\r\nprinciples he wished to have the clock exhibit and the mathematical\r\nprinciples which would be involved to operate them. Bertolla\r\nconcentrated on them and tried to transcribe the principles into\r\nfunctional mechanical terms, visualizing each operation in terms of\r\nwheels and gears. Little by little the two men coordinated the numerous\r\nelements and welded them into an operating entity. They adjourned either\r\nto the stark simplicity of the rectory or, probably more often, to\r\nBertolla's little home workshop, the priest standing over his friend\r\nwhile the latter worked at his bench in the dark paneled interior\r\nilluminated only by the several lamps on the work benches.\r\n\r\nThis first clock which the two men combined to create is a monument to\r\nthe great scientific knowledge of the self-taught priest and the\r\ntechnical ability of the clockmaker--a unity combining astronomical\r\nscience, mechanics, and artistry. The story of the project is told in a\r\nlittle book, _Novissima Ac Perpetua Astronomica..._, which Borghesi\r\nlater published. Explaining the incentive which inspired him, and the\r\npremises from which he began his work, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     From the foundation of astronomical science long ago,\r\n     innumerable [and] repeated observations of both ancient and\r\n     modern astronomers, emerged at last from their hiding places.\r\n     Made light of by the jests of so many outstanding intellects,\r\n     they have so successfully brought to light the paths of the\r\n     stars and their motions, which are more complicated to us than\r\n     the Gordian knots. Now it is possible for even an amateur in\r\n     astronomy, sufficiently instructed, to predict for any given\r\n     time not only the mean position of the planets, but also their\r\n     true longitude and latitude, and even the true time of their\r\n     conjunctions, and their ecliptic oppositions, with all the\r\n     attendant circumstances. Yet, until now, no hypothesis has been\r\n     devised which would force an automaton to show to us, before\r\n     our very eyes, the eclipses of the planets in their true and\r\n     certain times.\r\n\r\n     For though there have been men seeking with all their might to\r\n     bind by laws their artificial heavens, by I know not how many\r\n     and how great calculations, and to systematize the complexities\r\n     of the rotations of celestial bodies; nevertheless, all of\r\n     them, as if by common agreement, considered themselves to have\r\n     made great contributions to mechanico-theoretical astronomy.\r\n     However, they have only attained, even though closely, the mean\r\n     locations of the secondary mobiles, and those by a certain\r\n     rather crude calculation. Some attained by more, some by less,\r\n     but all by some degree of wandering from the truth, either worn\r\n     out by the intricacies of the motions, or deceived and\r\n     deceiving by the errors of their calculations. This fact those\r\n     well know, who, setting about to collect information of this\r\n     kind, even those publicized not long ago, with true\r\n     astronomical calculation, have been bored to death while\r\n     digging out by the most elementary and superficial arithmetical\r\n     torture, the worst of fallacies spontaneously erupting from\r\n     thence.\r\n\r\n     It would seem that true calculations alone can be desired in\r\n     mechanico-astronomics. Long study had not only convinced me\r\n     that an automaton was within the realm of possibility, but that\r\n     there were many mechanical systems by which it could be\r\n     achieved. I girded myself for a new project and developed it\r\n     theoretically from the ground up, but under such unhappy\r\n     auspices that not only did all hope fail that anyone would ever\r\n     appear who might have seemed willing to set his hand to the\r\n     work, but that the new discovery itself was scoffed at by many\r\n     as altogether a nightmarish delirium of an unbridled\r\n     imagination.\r\n\r\nThe first months of the project must have seemed like an inspired dream\r\nto the two men, and then must have followed a period of hopeless\r\ndepression. Bertolla undoubtedly felt many times that the clock was an\r\naspiration far beyond their combined abilities and means, but the priest\r\nwould not be thwarted in his ambition and refused to abandon the\r\nproject. He felt that it was a work that they were destined to produce.\r\nMany times, he wrote, he chided and begged and shamed his erstwhile\r\npartner into resuming the project where it had been last abandoned.\r\nLittle by little, the first clock began to take form. As each new\r\ndifficulty was encountered, the two men would go back over the notes and\r\nsketches to trace the problem to its source. Often a new part of the\r\nmechanism would nullify another which had thus far operated\r\nsuccessfully, and a complete rearrangement would be required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--TITLE PAGE of Father Borghesi's first book.\r\nThe translation in its entirety is: \"The Most Recent, Perpetual,\r\nAstronomical Calendar Clock: Theoretical--Practical: by means of which\r\nbesides the hours, the minutes and seconds; the current year, the month;\r\nthe day of the month and the day of the week; the dominical letter,\r\nepact, and thence, the day of all the feastdays, both fixed and movable;\r\nthe solar cycle; the golden number; the Roman indiction; the dominant\r\nplanet of any year and its sign; the phases of the moon and its mean\r\nage: and all the motions of the sun and the moon as to longitude,\r\nlatitude, eccentricity, etc., are immediately seen, so accurately that\r\n[not only] the true new full moons and the true quadrature, etc., of the\r\nsun and moon appear, but also, all solar and lunar eclipses--both\r\nvisible and invisible; as in heaven, so on the clock, they are\r\nconspicuously celebrated in their true times, and those of the past and\r\nthose of the future, with their circumstances of time and duration,\r\nmagnitude, etc., can be quickly determined. All this was devised and\r\nbrought to light by the author, Francesco Borghesi of Anáuni, a secular\r\npriest of Trent, A.A.L.L. & Doctor of Philosophy. (Trent: From the\r\nprintshop of Giovanni Battista Monauni, With Permission of Superiors.)\"\r\n(_Title page reproduced by permission of the Biblioteca della Citta di\r\nTrento._)]\r\n\r\nAgain and again, Bertolla threw up his hands in despair and begged\r\nFather Borghesi to abandon the enterprise. He protested that he was not\r\ncapable of producing such a complicated mechanism; he had neither the\r\ntools nor the skill. The priest wished to produce a clock such as the\r\nworld had never seen before, such as the greatest scientists and\r\nclockmakers of all time had never been able to make. But Bertolla felt\r\nthat he was only a provincial craftsman who could not hope to surpass\r\nthem all with only his simple tools and training.\r\n\r\nIn his book on the first clock, _Novissima Ac Perpetua Astronomica..._,\r\nFather Borghesi wrote that when he had finally come within a few weeks\r\nof the embryo stage in the development of his clock, he was faced with\r\nthe problem of bolstering the sagging enthusiasm of Bertolla. The\r\nclockmaker's original enthusiasm had shown promise of great results, but\r\nas the days passed and the problems of the multiplex and generally\r\nunfamiliar apparatus to be forged for the workings of the automaton\r\nbecame more complex, his ardor decreased. Finally, Bertolla became so\r\ndiscouraged by the scoffers and frustrated by the fact that the work was\r\ninsufficiently organized that Father Borghesi wrote that \"it almost\r\nbecame a harder task for me to bolster up by daily opportunity and\r\nimportunity the failing patience of the artisan, frightened away from\r\nthe work already begun, than it was for me to extract from the inner\r\nrecesses of mathematics and astronomy, without light and without a\r\nguide, the whole fabric of the machine itself!\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of Bertolla's protests, Father Borghesi prevailed, reviving his\r\nfriend's interest once more until the two were deep in the project\r\nagain. Months passed as they worked together on the mechanism and it\r\nseemed as if they lived for no other purpose. Inevitably, Bertolla's\r\nhealth began to suffer, undermined as it was by the constant nervous\r\ntension, and he eventually became ill from mental strain. He was forced\r\nto spend some time in bed, and for many weeks the subject of the clock\r\nwas not discussed. Bertolla's other work, by which he made his living,\r\nsuffered and it was several months before he was able to return to his\r\nlittle shop.\r\n\r\nOne year passed into another and the work progressed slowly. The first\r\nclock, which easily should have been finished in less than a year, was\r\nnot completed until after three full years had passed. However, when the\r\npriest and the clockmaker put the finishing touches to their great\r\nclock, the result surpassed the greatest possible expectations, for it\r\nwas truly a masterpiece. Not only did it illustrate the ecliptic\r\nphenomena of the moon, the sun and earth occurring in their proper time,\r\nas well as many other things, but it showed these operations as they\r\nsucceeded in proper order, taking place through the centuries.\r\n\r\nWith mutual feelings of great pride, the two friends surveyed the result\r\nof their three years of endeavor. Bertolla realized that he had reached\r\na point of maximum achievement in his work. He probably felt that now he\r\ncould relax again, that his sleep would no longer be troubled by\r\nconfused nightmares of wheels and gears that did not mesh together. Time\r\nwas to prove otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST CLOCK\r\n\r\nFather Borghesi soon came to the conclusion that it would be desirable\r\nto have a written description to explain the mechanism of the clock and\r\nits many indicators. He thereupon wrote out the story of how the clock\r\nwas made, the reasons for embarking on the enterprise, the difficulties\r\nhe had encountered, and the success which had crowned his and Bertolla's\r\nmutual labors. Finally, he described the operation of the clock's\r\nmechanism and the functions of its array of indicators.\r\n\r\nThe little book was written in Latin and only a few copies were printed,\r\npresumably at the priest's own expense, on a handpress by Giovanni\r\nBattista Monauni, printer to the Bishop in Trent. The little volume was\r\nstated by contemporary writers to have been published in 1763, although\r\nno date appears on the title page. The title translated is, in part,\r\n_The Most Recent, Perpetual Astronomical Calendar Clock,\r\nTheoretical--Practical...._ The work begins with an introduction for the\r\nreader in which Father Borghesi stated that:\r\n\r\n     ... the little work, which, as far as I was concerned could\r\n     easily have been finished in a year, was only completed after\r\n     about three years. Fortunately, however, it was so far beyond\r\n     the expectations of most, that not only am I able to foretell\r\n     with certainty all the lunar ecliptic phenomena and the solar,\r\n     or rather terrestrial, phenomena, carefully worked out in their\r\n     true periods, among many other matters exhibited by the\r\n     machine; but also, within a few hours, I can exhibit by\r\n     altogether tangible evidence to the skeptics and the doubting\r\n     those very same phenomena, occurring within the space of many\r\n     years, or even centuries, and succeeding one another in proper\r\n     order, with their many attendant circumstances. I was not much\r\n     concerned about the other eclipses, such as those of Mercury,\r\n     Venus, and the other stars wandering through the zodiac, or\r\n     about the other solar eclipses from the transit of Mercury or\r\n     Venus, since they are altogether undiscernible to the naked\r\n     eye, and very few compilers of ephemerides wish them to be\r\n     noted, probably for the same reason.\r\n\r\n     Do not, however, expect, star-loving reader, that here anything\r\n     at all that you may wish can be drawn forth as from its source,\r\n     for to demand this would be almost the same as to seek to drain\r\n     as from a cup all the vast knowledge of the many arithmetical\r\n     sciences from the narrow confines of one book. You will\r\n     understand how impossible that is when, through prolonged\r\n     labor, you have grown somewhat more mature in this kind of\r\n     learning.\r\n\r\n     Wherefore, rather fully, and out of consideration for you, I\r\n     have decided, setting aside these prolixities, with completely\r\n     synoptic brevity and with all possible clarity to expound for\r\n     you simply the proportion of the movements, the description of\r\n     the machine, and its usage. As a result, when you have\r\n     progressed a little in theoretical mechanics, you will not only\r\n     be able to reduce all these things to their astronomical\r\n     principles, but you may find the way more smoothly laid out for\r\n     you even for perfecting the machine itself. And, thus, you may\r\n     be more effectively encouraged to a successful conclusion. Let\r\n     it be so now for you through the following 10 chapters!\r\n\r\nAfter these rather hopeful assurances, Father Borghesi proceeded to\r\nprovide a detailed description of the clock dial and functions in the 10\r\nshort chapters which he had promised, under a separate section entitled\r\n\"Synopsis Totius Operis Mechanici,\" which is translated in its entirety\r\nin the appendix.\r\n\r\nAs Father Borghesi prepared his little volume about his first clock, and\r\ndescribed its unusual features and outlined its functions, which were\r\nprimarily to place in evidence the celestial constellations, it occurred\r\nto him that it would now be easier after the experience he had acquired\r\nwith his first timepiece, to construct another clock, which would\r\npresent the motions of the two astronomical systems, the Ptolemaic and\r\nthe Copernican. In this first book, he promised the reader that he would\r\nundertake the second project. It is fortunate that Father Borghesi\r\nundertook this project for the second clock is the only example of his\r\nwork that is known to exist today. Extensive research has not shown what\r\nhappened to the first clock, although several sources state that both\r\ntimepieces were presented to Empress Maria Theresa sometime between 1764\r\nand 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Borghesi Clock\r\n\r\n\r\nFather Borghesi lost no time in initiating the project of the second\r\nclock. The first and most important step was to inform Bertolla and\r\nenlist his assistance. Bertolla was adamant: he had had enough of\r\ncomplicated astronomical movements. He was delighted by the prospect of\r\nreturning to his former simple life, producing simple, domestic,\r\nelementary movements for his country clients. Father Borghesi begged and\r\ncajoled. The second clock would be a much simpler one to construct, he\r\npersisted. After all, they had gained invaluable experience from the\r\nproduction of the first clock. Furthermore, he had already completed its\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nBertolla apparently wavered in his resolve and, unwillingly and against\r\nhis better judgment, he allowed the priest's inducements to prevail.\r\nOnce again, the two friends yielded their leisure hours to a study of\r\nthe priest's books and drawings as Father Borghesi enthusiastically\r\nelaborated his design for the timepiece, and Bertolla attempted to\r\ntranscribe astronomical indications into terms of wheel counts. The\r\nsecond clock was, as Borghesi had promised, much easier of execution.\r\nWithin a year, it was completed and functioned with complete success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--THE BORGHESI CLOCK in the Museum of History\r\nand Technology, constructed in 1764 by Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla of\r\nMocenigo di Rumo from the designs of Father Francesco Borghesi of Rumo\r\nand Mechel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--ANOTHER VIEW of the Borghesi clock.]\r\n\r\nThis is the clock now in the Museum of History and Technology. It is\r\nhoused in a tall case of dark-red mahogany veneered on oak, with\r\nrestrained carving featuring ribands and foliate motifs. Gilt-brass\r\ndecorations flank the face of the hood, which is surmounted by three\r\ngilt-brass finials in the form of orbs. A wide door in the waist may be\r\nopened to attend the weights. The case is 7 feet 8 inches high, 20-1/2\r\ninches wide at the waist, and 14 inches in depth.\r\n\r\nThe dial is of gilt brass, measuring 21 inches high and 15 inches in\r\nwidth, with a number of supplementary silvered dials visible through its\r\nopenings. Instead of hands, the dial utilizes three concentric rings\r\nmoving around a central disc, the indications of which are read at two\r\nbisecting gilt lines inscribed in the glass face. Twelve separate\r\nfunctions are performed by the chapter ring assembly alone, and there\r\nare 14 openings on the dial. It is estimated that the clock performs 30\r\nseparate functions, including striking and chiming. Of the multiple\r\nchapter rings, the outermost is 1-1/8 inches wide, the center ring is\r\n3/8 inch wide, and the innermost ring measures 1-1/4 inches in width.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAL-PLATE ENGRAVINGS\r\n\r\nThe gilt dial is incised throughout with figures and inscriptions in\r\nengraving of the very finest quality, as is evidenced in the\r\nillustrations. The frontispiece is surmounted at its center by the\r\ncrowned double eagle of the House of Hapsburg, indicating the identity\r\nof the sovereign in whose reign it was made, Emperor Francis I or the\r\nEmpress Maria Theresa of Austria. Below the eagle at either side are\r\nflying cherubs supporting ribands with inscriptions. Centered at the\r\nbottom of the frontispiece immediately above the chapter rings is the\r\nmoving silvered orb representing the sun. Surrounding it is a tableau of\r\nthe Holy Trinity, with the Virgin Mary being crowned by Christ holding a\r\ncross at the left and God with a sword in hand at the right, and a dove\r\nrepresenting the Holy Spirit hovering over the Virgin's head. Father S.\r\nX. Winters, S.J., considers it reminiscent of the triptych \"The\r\nCoronation of the Virgin\" by Fra Lippo Lippi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--DIAGRAM OF the dial plate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--DIAL PLATE of the Borghesi clock.]\r\n\r\nKEY TO DIAGRAM OF THE DIAL PLATE\r\n\r\nA Dominating planet, represented by its symbol and its house;\r\n\r\nB Dominical letter (Lit.

The phrase may be translated as \"May\r\nFrancis I be the eternal ruler by favor of the planets\" or more simply\r\n\"Long Live Francis I, Emperor.\"[14] Although the dial plate of the\r\nBorghesi clock is inscribed with his name, the records indicate that\r\nthe clock was presented to Maria Theresa. Francis I may have already\r\ndied before the presentation was made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--PORTRAIT OF FRANCIS I, Emperor of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire, to whom Father Borghesi's astronomical clock in the Museum\r\nof History and Technology appears to have been inscribed.]\r\n\r\nFrom the left to right over the tableau of the Holy Trinity is the\r\nphrase \"Lavs sacrosanctae Triadi Vni Deo, et Deiparae\" (Praise [be] to\r\nthe most Holy Trinity, to the one God, and to the Mother of God).\r\n\r\nWithin the upper left and right spandrels is inscribed:\r\n\r\n     Isthaec, Signum grande apparvit in Coelo * sancta Dei genitrix\r\n     amicta sole * Illibato pede Lvnae et serpentis nigra premens\r\n     Cornva * bis senis pvlcherrime Coronata syderibvs * Tempe\r\n     indesinenter clavsa, scatvrigo signata * Cedrvs in Libano,\r\n     Cypresvs in Monte Sion * Mater pvrae Dilectionis sanctaeqve\r\n     spei * Chara patris aeterni proles, Verbi Mater, sponsaqve\r\n     procedentis *, gratiae et gloriae circvmdata varietate.\r\n\r\nThis inscription is a eulogy to the Virgin Mary assembled from the texts\r\nof Holy Scripture. In addition, each _lemma_, contained within\r\nasterisks, carries out the chronogram 1764, the year the clock was\r\ncompleted. Each _lemma_ is translated and identified from the\r\nDouay-Rheims version of the Bible:\r\n\r\n     This woman: a great sign appeared in Heaven (Apocalypse 12:1) *\r\n     The Holy Mother of God clothed with the sun (Apocalypse 12:1) *\r\n     And with unharmed foot crushing the black horns of the moon\r\n     (Apocalypse 12:1) and the serpent (Genesis 3:15) * Most\r\n     beautifully crowned with twice-six (Apocalypse 12:1) * A garden\r\n     [_Tempe_[15]] enclosed, sealed with a fountain [spring of\r\n     water] (Song of Songs 4:12) * Like a cedar in Lebanon, and a\r\n     cypress tree on Mount Zion; (Ecclesiasticus 24:17) * Mother of\r\n     pure love and of holy hope: Beloved daughter of the Eternal\r\n     Father, Mother of the Word, Spouse of the Holy Spirit:\r\n     (Ecclesiasticus 24:24) * Surrounded with a diversity of grace\r\n     and glory (Psalms 44:10).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER of the dial plate,\r\nshowing two noblemen contemplating an orb, with the inscription \"Diligit\r\nAvdaces Trepidos Fortvna Repellet.\" (Fortune favors the daring and\r\nrejects the timid.)]\r\n\r\nAt the lower left corner below the figure of Atlas upholding the world\r\nis the phrase, _Assidvo proni donant di cvncta labori_. (The favorable\r\ngods willingly grant all things to the assiduous laborer.) The same\r\nphrase is quoted by Father Borghesi in the text of his second volume.\r\nThe last inscription appears at the lower right corner under the figures\r\nof the two noblemen, _Diligit avdaces trepidos fortvna repellet_.\r\n(Fortune favors the daring and rejects the timid.) The last two\r\ninscriptions are in dactylic hexameter. They appear to be original\r\ncompositions inasmuch as no classical prototypes have been identified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER of the dial plate,\r\nshowing the engraving of Atlas, with the inscription \"Assidvo proni\r\ndonant di cvncta labori.\" (The favorable gods willingly grant all things\r\nto the assiduous laborer.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTER DIAL INSCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--DETAIL OF FRONTISPIECE of the Borghesi clock,\r\nshowing the apertures for calendar indicators and the details of the\r\nengraving.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the inscriptions previously noted on the outer dial\r\nplate, there are three major inscriptions in the central dial. The\r\noutermost states _Circulus horarius Soli_, _Lunae_, _Fixis_, _Nodis_,\r\n_Aestuique marino communis_ (the hour circle, common to the sun, the\r\nmoon, the fixed stars, the nodes and to the sea tide). This inscription\r\nis divided into four parts by the insertion of four divisions for the\r\nday into canonical hours: [_Horae_] _Nocturnae_ (night hours);\r\n_Matutinae_ (morning hours); _Diurnae_ (daytime hours) and _Vespertinae_\r\n(evening hours).\r\n\r\nThe next section of the central dial is inscribed\r\n_Intumescite--Detumescite_ (rise and fall of the tides) repeated at\r\nintervals of approximately every six hours. Within the next section is\r\nthe following inscription, inscribed continuously around the ring:\r\n\r\n     Lege fluunt, refluunt, dormitant hac maris undae: Ad Phoebi et\r\n     Phoebes concordia iussa moventur Aequora; discordi iussu\r\n     suspensa quiescunt.\r\n\r\nTranslated, this is:\r\n\r\n     By this law the sea waves ebb and flow and lie dormant: When\r\n     Phoebus and Diana agree in their commands, the waters are\r\n     moved; when they disagree, the waters lie silent.[16]\r\n\r\nWithin the central boss of the dial plate, the name of the maker is\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n     Bvrghesio Doctore, et Bertolla Limatore Annaniensibvs*\r\n\r\nTranslated, this is:\r\n\r\n     [By] Doctor Borghesi and Bertolla, mechanician citizens of\r\n     Anáuni.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATORS IN THE FRONTISPIECE\r\n\r\nThere are 12 windows in the frontispiece, through each of which appears\r\nan indication relating to time. Beginning at the top of the frontispiece\r\nof the dial, the first opening occurs on the breast of the imperial\r\neagle. This indicates the dominating planet, represented by its symbol,\r\nand its house.\r\n\r\nThe opening in the eagle's left claw, labeled \"Lit. Dom.\" is the\r\ndominical letter. The first seven days in the month of January are each\r\nassigned one of the letters _a_ through _g_ in order of appearance. The\r\nletter which coincides with the first Sunday within this period is\r\ncalled the dominical letter, and it serves for the following year. In\r\nleap year, two letters are required, one to February 29th and the letter\r\nnext proceeding for the remainder of the year. This letter is used in\r\nconnection with establishing the date of Easter Sunday. The date of\r\nEaster regulates the dates of the other movable feasts.\r\n\r\nThe eagle's right claw is labeled \"Cyc. EpEC\" and represents the epact,\r\nor the age of the moon on January 1st. It serves to find the moon's age\r\nby indicating the number of days to be added to each lunar year in order\r\nto complete a solar year. Twelve lunar months are nearly 11 days short\r\nof the solar year, so that the new moons in one year fall 11 days\r\nearlier than they did the preceding year. However, 30 days are deducted\r\nas an intercalary month since the moon has made a revolution in that\r\ntime, and the remainder, 3, would be the epact.\r\n\r\nBelow the imperial eagle two winged cherubs support a riband with three\r\nindictions of the Julian period. This period of 7980 years is the\r\nproduct derived from multiplying together the sums of 28, which\r\nrepresents the cycle of the sun; 19, representing the cycle of the moon;\r\nand 15, which represents the Roman indiction. The Julian period is\r\nreckoned to have begun from 4713 B.C. so that the period will be\r\ncompleted in A.D. 3267. The first of the three openings is marked \"Ind.\r\nRom.\" or \"Roman indiction,\" which was an edict by the Emperor\r\nConstantine in A.D. 312, providing for the assessment of a property tax\r\nat the beginning of each 15-year cycle. It continues to be used in\r\necclesiastical contracts. The second opening, which occurs immediately\r\nbelow the eagle, is marked \"Cyc. Sol.\" (cycle of the sun). This cycle\r\ntakes a period of 28 years, after which the days of the week once again\r\nfall upon the same days of the month as they did during the first year\r\nof the former cycle. There is no relationship with the course of the sun\r\nitself, but was invented for the purpose of determining the dominical\r\nletter which designates the days of the month on which the Sundays occur\r\nduring each year of the cycle. Since cycles of the sun date from 9 years\r\nbefore the Christian era, it is necessary to add the digit 9 to the\r\ndigits of the current year and then divide the result by 28. The\r\nquotient is the number of cycles which has passed, and the remainder\r\nwill be the year of the cycle answering to the current year. The third\r\nopening on the riband is labeled \"Num. Aur.\" (golden number). Meton, an\r\nastronomer of Athens, discovered in 432 B.C. that after a period of 19\r\nyears the new and the full moons returned on the same days of the month\r\nas they had before, and this is called the cycle of the moon. The Greeks\r\nwere so impressed with this calculation that they had it inscribed in\r\nletters of gold upon stone, hence the golden number. The First Council\r\nof Nicaea in A.D. 325 determined that Meton's cycle was to be used to\r\nregulate the movable feasts of the Church.\r\n\r\nImmediately above the chapter rings is an opening through which the orb\r\nof the sun is visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPTER-RING ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\nIn a separate chapter in his second volume, entitled \"Descriptio\r\nAuthomatis Summa totius Operis Mechanici\" (Description of the\r\nAutomaton--Summary of the Complete Mechanism), Father Borghesi provided\r\na description of the functions of the various indicators, prefixing it\r\nwith the short poem shown in figure 18. He then continues:\r\n\r\n     In the middle of the frontispiece, as at the center of the\r\n     universe, the terraqueous globe of the week revolves, with a\r\n     daily motion turning from right to left, bringing with it from\r\n     the round window the coming day and at the circumference the\r\n     circle of hours common to the sun, to the moon, to the fixed\r\n     stars, to the head and tail of the dragon, and to the raging\r\n     sea.\r\n\r\n     The second circle revolves the synodic-periodic measure of the\r\n     raging sea, the days of the median lunar-synodic age, the signs\r\n     and individual degrees of the signs of the distance of the moon\r\n     from the middle of the sun within the time of 29 terrestrial\r\n     revolutions, hours 12.44.3.13. This circle revolves likewise\r\n     from right to left around the center of the earth. In this\r\n     second circle, another little orb revolves, bringing with it\r\n     the epicycle of the moon, in which the little circle of the\r\n     moon (whose illuminated middle always faces towards the sun),\r\n     running from left to right through the signs of the anomaly;\r\n     within 13 revolutions of the earth, hours 18.39.16. It descends\r\n     from apogee to perigee and in just as many others it returns\r\n     from perigee to apogee, to be carried down thus to true, back\r\n     and front from the longitude and distance from the sun and from\r\n     the middle of the earth.\r\n\r\n     The third circle (on which I have tried to indicate\r\n     astronomically-geometrically in their places, the degrees of\r\n     lunar latitude both in the south and in the north, and some\r\n     fixed stars, those, namely, which can be separated by us from\r\n     the moon which goes between) from left to right turns around\r\n     the center of the earth, stretching out the head and tail of\r\n     the dragon, on the inside above the second circle for noting\r\n     and measuring the sun (but I should rather say the earth), and\r\n     the eclipses of the moon, within 346 revolutions of the earth,\r\n     hours 14.52.23.\r\n\r\n     The fourth circle, in which the heaven of the fixed stars,\r\n     reduced to the correct ascent of our times, the signs of the\r\n     zodiac and the individual degrees of the signs, the months of\r\n     the year and the single days of the month can be seen, likewise\r\n     makes its journey around the earth from left to right in 365\r\n     terrestrial revolutions, hours 5.48.56.; that is, within a\r\n     median astronomical year. Above this annual orb, the sun, in\r\n     its small epicycle, gliding through the 12 signs of the\r\n     anomaly, within the space of 182 terrestrial revolutions, hours\r\n     15.6.58., from left to right, falls from apogee to perigee;\r\n     and, within the same time, rises from perigee to apogee, and\r\n     brings with it, the index, namely its central radius, inhering\r\n     to the axis of the equatorial orb and cutting the four greatest\r\n     circles from the center.\r\n\r\n     When the sun has been moved around, Iris shows from six windows\r\n     the era, that is, the current year. Two winged youths take\r\n     their place next to Iris, carrying the Julian period: namely,\r\n     the Roman indiction, the cycle of the sun and the golden\r\n     number, on a leaf of paper held between them. The imperial\r\n     eagle stands out on top (as if added to the frontispiece)\r\n     carrying on its breast the dominating planet and in its talons\r\n     the ecclesiastical calends (that is, the dominical letter and\r\n     the epact).\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACHMENTS FOR ADJUSTMENT\r\n\r\nTwo attachments, in the form of small superimposed dials are situated at\r\nthe base of the dial plate, at either side and immediately below the\r\nfourth chapter ring. In his second volume, Father Borghesi stated that\r\nthey \"are not moved from inside the clock, but the one at the right\r\n[inscribed _concitat_ and _retardat_] serves for loosening\r\n[accelerating] and tightening [retarding] time; that is, the reins of\r\nthe perpendicular.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the purpose of this attachment is for adjusting the\r\npendulum to make the clock operate fast or slow. The second attachment,\r\nwhich appears at the left, and which is inscribed \"Claudit\" (close) and\r\n\"Aperit\" (open) serves the purpose of \"... preparing the mechanism in a\r\nmoment, as swiftly as you wish, for sustaining the astronomical\r\nexperiments of which you will hear later; when these things have been\r\ndone, it restores the mechanism to its natural motion at the same\r\nspeed.\"\r\n\r\nThis adjustment relates to the final section of Father Borghesi's second\r\nbook, entitled \"Chronologo-Astronomicus Usus Authomatis\"\r\n(Chronological-Astronomical Use of the Automaton), which is translated\r\nfrom the Latin in its entirety:\r\n\r\n     With one glance at this automaton, you can quickly answer these\r\n     questions: What hour the sun shows, the moon, any fixed star,\r\n     the head and tail of the dragon. Is the sea swelling with\r\n     periodic heat [at high tide?] or is it deflated [low tide], or\r\n     quiescent? How many days is it from mean new moon or full moon?\r\n     By how many signs and degrees is the moon distant from the sun,\r\n     and from its nodes? What sign of the zodiac does the sun\r\n     occupy, the moon, the head and tail of the dragon? Is the sun\r\n     or the moon, in apogee or perigee, ascending or descending?\r\n     What is the apparent speed of the sun and of the moon? What is\r\n     the apparent magnitude of the solar and lunar diameter, and of\r\n     the horizontal parallax of the umbra and penumbra of the earth?\r\n     What is the latitude of the moon? Is it north or south? Does\r\n     the moon hide [occult eclipse] any of the fixed stars from the\r\n     earth dwellers, and which of these does it obscure? Is there a\r\n     true new or full moon? Is the sun in eclipse anywhere on earth?\r\n     What is the magnitude, and the duration of this eclipse, with\r\n     respect to the whole earth? Can it be seen in the north or in\r\n     the south? Is the moon in eclipse? Total or partial? Of what\r\n     magnitude, etc.? What limb of the moon is obscured? How many\r\n     years have passed from a given epoch? Is this year a leap year,\r\n     or a common year--first, second, or third after leap year? What\r\n     is the current month of the year, and what day of the month and\r\n     of the week? Which of the planets is dominant? What days of the\r\n     year do the various feasts fall on, and the movable feasts\r\n     during the ecclesiastical year? And many other similar\r\n     questions, which I pass over here for the sake of brevity.\r\n\r\n     Besides, this device can be so arranged for any time\r\n     whatsoever, past or future, and for the longitude of any\r\n     region, and can be so manipulated by hand, that within the\r\n     space of a very short time there can be provided in their\r\n     proper order, the various orbits of the luminous bodies, their\r\n     alternating eclipses, as many as have taken place through the\r\n     course of many years, or even from the beginning of the world;\r\n     or those that will be seen as long as the world itself shall\r\n     last, with all their attendant circumstances (year, month, day,\r\n     duration, magnitude, etc.). All these can be seen with great\r\n     satisfaction of curiosity and of learning, and hence with great\r\n     pleasure to the soul. In the meanwhile, the little bells\r\n     continually play, at their proper, respective times. So that,\r\n     all exaggeration aside, a thousand years pass, in the sight of\r\n     this clock, as one day!\r\n\r\n     I am aware of your complaints, O star-loving reader--that my\r\n     description is too meager and too succinct. Lay the blame for\r\n     this on those cares, hateful both to me and to you, more\r\n     pressing, which forbid me and deprive you of a methodical\r\n     explanation of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOCK MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nFather Borghesi specified that the entire mechanism was equal in weight\r\nto a seventh part of a _Centenarii Germanici_, a Germanic hundredweight.\r\nThis is probably the Austrian centner which is equivalent to 123.4615\r\npounds. Therefore, the clock mechanism weighs approximately 17.6 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe clock operated for a hundred days and more at a single winding,\r\naccording to Father Borghesi, and by means of a pendulum with a leaden\r\nbob weighing 60 Viennese pounds, attached at a height of 5 feet. Father\r\nBorghesi stated the weight of the pendulum to be 60 _librarum\r\nViennensium_, but the Viennese libra does not appear among the weights\r\nof the Austrian Empire. However, using the average libra, an ancient\r\nRoman unit of weight equal to 0.7221 pound, it may be assumed that the\r\ndriving weight should be approximately 45 pounds.\r\n\r\nFather Borghesi, however, does not venture to provide any description\r\nwhatsoever of the movement of his second clock in his book. He gave the\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n     But beyond this, I entirely omit [a description of] the further\r\n     apparatus of the very many wheels, etc., inside the clock which\r\n     carry on its functions, lest I become too verbose for some\r\n     persons. To explain more thoroughly the internal labyrinth of\r\n     the entire mechanism, from which the movement of the circles or\r\n     heavens, etc., are derived, would seem to entangle in too many\r\n     complicated perplexities.... Therefore, that I might not delay\r\n     longer, and perhaps to no purpose, I have thought it better to\r\n     leave the whole work to the proportionate calculus of the\r\n     arithmeticians and the technical skill of mechanics. If they\r\n     have any desire to construct a similar mechanism, they will\r\n     follow the aforesaid motions of the heavens, etc., not only by\r\n     one means alone but by many, more swiftly through thoughtful\r\n     study than by any amount of instruction.\r\n\r\n     For whoever is well versed in the theory of calculus and sets\r\n     to work at any given project, will discover any desired motion\r\n     by a thousand and more ways, by one or another gearing of\r\n     wheels; which an industrious mechanic will carry out in\r\n     actuality and without too much difficulty. Nor is there any\r\n     reason for anyone to be discouraged, so long as he is not\r\n     disgusted by the amount of labor for there is nothing truer\r\n     than the old saying \"The favorable gods grant everything to the\r\n     assiduous laborer.\"\r\n\r\n     Nay, further, even this little work itself can be improved on\r\n     and surpassed by new inventions. Otherwise that other old\r\n     adage, almost as old as the world, would prove false, \"What you\r\n     have found already done, you can easily repeat, nor is it\r\n     difficult to add to what has already been invented.\" Relying on\r\n     this principle, I have already conceived some new things to be\r\n     added to the present little work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--MOVEMENT OF BORGHESI CLOCK viewed from the\r\nright side, with details of chiming mechanism.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELLS\r\n\r\nThere is a discrepancy between Father Borghesi's written description in\r\nhis second book of the number of bells and those which currently exist\r\nin the clock. At the present time, there are two sets of bells attached\r\nto the upper part of the movement. While Father Borghesi indicated that\r\nthere were two sets of bells in the clock, he described the first set by\r\nstating that:\r\n\r\n     ... there are three bells inside the clock: The largest, when\r\n     struck by a little hammer at each mean new moon, signifies the\r\n     new moon. The smallest indicates in the same way the full moon\r\n     at the time of the mean full moon, by automatic sound. When on\r\n     the equatorial earth, the sun appears anywhere in eclipse, two\r\n     bells (the largest and the medium) sounding together\r\n     automatically, announce that eclipse at the time of the mean\r\n     new moon. (I think it is evident that eclipses of the sun occur\r\n     at new moons and eclipses of the moon at full moon.)\r\n\r\n     When the moon is eclipsed, the smallest and the medium bells,\r\n     simultaneously and automatically, announce the event to the ear\r\n     at the time of the mean full moon. Besides, at the proper time\r\n     and automatically, the largest of these bells announces the\r\n     current solar hour and the smallest bell strikes the quarter\r\n     hours.\r\n\r\nIn the clock today, the first set consists of a smaller bell fixed\r\nwithin a larger one. It is presumably these bells that indicate the\r\neclipses and also strike the hours and quarter hours. A pull cord\r\nattached to the striking mechanism repeats the current hour and quarter\r\nhours at will. The second set consists of nine meshed bells struck with\r\nindividual hammers operated by means of a pinned cylinder as in a music\r\nbox. On the hour, the chimes play one of two melodies, which may be\r\nchanged at will. While not identified, these appear to be Tyrolean folk\r\nmelodies. The largest of this set of bells is dissimilar to the other\r\nchimes, and may be the third bell described by Father Borghesi to\r\nsignify the new moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOGRAMS\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious aspects of the second clock produced by Father\r\nBorghesi and Bertolla, as well as of the second published volume, is the\r\npresence of chronograms which occur repeatedly on the clock dial and\r\nthroughout the _Novissimum Theorico-Practicum Astronomicum Authoma_ from\r\nthe title page to the end of the book. Interestingly enough, Father\r\nBorghesi did not utilize this device even once in his first little book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--A CHRONOGRAM in the text of Father Borghesi's\r\nsecond volume, indicating the year 1764. The poem is translated as: \"In\r\nthe Mount of 'Anáuni,' the inscrutable heavens are led, You learn from\r\nthese all the labors of the sun and the moon. Here you are shown and\r\nhear the conjunction of the moon: And a bell brings to the ears by its\r\nsound, all eclipses.\"]\r\n\r\nWebster defines a chronogram as an inscription, sentence, or phrase in\r\nwhich certain letters express a date or epoch. The method used by Father\r\nBorghesi for forming chronograms was a simple one. He used combinations\r\nof uppercase and lowercase letters in two sizes in the inscriptions on\r\nthe clock dial and in his writings. At first this curious combination in\r\nthe inscriptions on the dial plate was a source of considerable\r\nspeculation. The extremely fine quality of the engraving and artistry\r\nwas such that these combinations could only be deliberate in nature and\r\nnot the accidental whims or accidents of the engraver. Accordingly, they\r\nmust be chronographic in intention. Such proved to be the case.\r\n\r\nBorghesi used the larger size of uppercase letters to form the\r\nchronogram, and each chronogram was complete within a phrase or line. He\r\naccomplished this by using for this purpose those letters of the\r\nalphabet which form the Roman numerals. The uppercase letters found\r\nwithin words are copied off in the order in which they appear in the\r\ninscription or phrase. These are then converted into their numerical\r\nequivalents, and totaled. Taking the uppermost inscription on the clock\r\ndial as the first example:\r\n\r\n    FranCIsCVs I sIt pLan. DoMInator aeternVs\r\n\r\nThe letters which are intended to form the chronogram are:\r\n\r\n     C  I  C  V I I  L  D    M  I V\r\n\r\n    100 1 100 5 1 1 50 500 1000 1 5\r\n\r\nThese figures added together total 1764.\r\n\r\nThe second inscription on the clock dial which forms a chronogram is\r\n\r\n    LaVs saCrosanCtae TrIaDI VnI Deo, et DeIparae\r\n\r\n     L V  C   C  I  D  I V I  D   D  I\r\n\r\n    50 5 100 100 1 500 1 5 1 500 500 1 = 1764.\r\n\r\nThe third inscription required a little more planning, because of its\r\ngreater length. Accordingly, Father Borghesi divided it into nine parts,\r\neach of which is separated from the other by means of asterisks. Each of\r\nthe nine parts of the inscription formed a chronogram which, in every\r\ninstance, totals to the date 1764, the year in which the second clock\r\nwas completed. The same procedure was followed with the inscriptions in\r\nthe lower left and the lower right corners of the dial as well as with\r\nthe maker's inscription within the central disk. This inscription is\r\n\r\n    BVrghesIo DoCtore, et BertoLLa LIMatore AnnanIensIbVs\r\n\r\n    V I  D   C   L  L  L I  M   I I V\r\n\r\n    5 1 500 100 50 50 50 1 1000 1 1 5 = 1764.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions within the chapter ring are not utilized for\r\nchronograms, however. It is apparent that Father Borghesi was required\r\nto make a most careful selection of the texts for his inscriptions in\r\norder that none of the phrases included any additional letters which\r\nformed Roman numerals than would total to the date he desired to\r\nindicate, namely, 1764. Where it was necessary, he employed an asterisk\r\nto separate parts of texts so that each would produce the same total.\r\nAny letter that did not form a Roman numeral, even if capitalized or\r\nused in a larger size, did not interfere with the formation of the\r\nchronograms.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his ingenuity in designing a text which would include only\r\nsuch of the letters representing the Roman numerals which would provide\r\nthe chronograms for 1764, Father Borghesi experienced some difficulties,\r\nparticularly in place names. He accordingly changed them in order to\r\navoid the inclusion of letters that would have disturbed his totals.\r\nExamples are MEGGL instead of MECHL, which had an extra C, and RVNNO\r\ninstead of RVMO, which had an extra M.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND CLOCK\r\n\r\nWhen the clock had been completed and proved to work successfully,\r\nBorghesi once more reduced a description of the clock and its function\r\nto published form in a second little volume published by Monauni. This\r\nsecond work was also in Latin, the title of which is translated as _The\r\nMost Recent Theoretical-Practical Astronomical Clock According to the\r\nEqually Most Recent System of the World_. As with his first book, Father\r\nBorghesi devoted a number of pages to a preface addressed to the reader,\r\nwhich is translated from the Latin:\r\n\r\n     This mechanical instrument was far from being ready for public\r\n     notice. A great deal of time and work remained to produce a\r\n     machine of this new system from the very foundations; then, by\r\n     a most accurate calculation to bring the motions of many wheels\r\n     up-to-date with the most recent astronomical observations; and,\r\n     finally, to fashion it with the craftsman's file, often enough\r\n     with a weary hand. All this work I had performed eagerly, so\r\n     that, while in my room, I might contemplate leisurely, both day\r\n     and night, the true face of the heavens and the seas unobscured\r\n     by clouds, even though I had no astronomical equipment. But,\r\n     then I remembered that, in my book on the first clock, I had\r\n     promised a description of a new (at least, as far as is known\r\n     to me) clock. Moreover, friends with astronomical interest, who\r\n     took part in the oft-repeated astronomical experiments\r\n     concerning this clock, persuaded me that the intellectual world\r\n     would enjoy having a greater knowledge and a description of\r\n     this work. However, it was not only the promises nor the\r\n     desires of many which moved me to write this work, but I also\r\n     thought it was necessary to set forth, before the description\r\n     of the clock, an exposition of the astronomical system\r\n     according to which this clock was constructed, so that the\r\n     complete work would be evident to all. I was concerned about\r\n     making this timepiece more acceptable and more understandable\r\n     to those people who are far distant and unable to see it, so\r\n     that this present exposition would obtain credulity among all.\r\n     I could find no better method than to set forth for the reader\r\n     the theory of the universe which I figured out after many\r\n     sleepless nights.\r\n\r\n     In testing this theory day after day, it not only appeared to\r\n     be complete, and true, but each day it appeared more\r\n     conformable to reality; it captured my mind in such a way that\r\n     I finally adhered to it. I desired, while I lived, to erect\r\n     this work as a monument to the theory. To do this, I digressed\r\n     a bit from the true-to-life pattern to the mechanical order so\r\n     that I could transfer all the movements of the heavens, etc.\r\n     (which I enjoyed thinking about more), to the plane surface of\r\n     the clock's face. In this way, the ecliptical spectacles of the\r\n     stars, etc., would appear at their proper times clearly before\r\n     the eyes of the viewer. I could also avoid many difficulties\r\n     which otherwise, perhaps, even the hands of the most skillful\r\n     craftsmen could never solve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--MOVEMENT OF THE BORGHESI CLOCK, viewed from\r\nthe rear, showing rear of dial plate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--TITLE PAGE of Father Borghesi's second\r\nbook. The translation in its entirety is: \"The Most Recent\r\nTheoretical-Practical Astronomical Clock According to the Equally Most\r\nRecent System of the World. Author: Francesco Borghesi of Mechel of\r\nAnáuni * Priest of Trent, Doctor of Philosophy * (The System of the\r\nClock) Ingeniously connected to new theoretical laws published 1764: and\r\nthe constructor, Bartholomeo Antonio Bertolla of Rumo, similarly from\r\nAnáuni * who skillfully produced this work * in this same current year\r\nof Our Lord * which is the year 5713 [sic] since God created this earth.\r\n(Trent: From the Printshop of Giovanni Battista Monauni, With Permission\r\nof the Superiors.)\" (_Title page reproduced by courtesy of the\r\nBiblioteca della Citta di Trento._)]\r\n\r\n     You ought to know, therefore, that as a result of my nightly\r\n     meditations, I have rejected, after much consideration, all the\r\n     explanations of the universe thus far published. All other\r\n     theories of the make-up of the universe, however admirable, and\r\n     however many there are, turn the sun and earth around in an\r\n     ecliptic in an annual movement. Thus, Philolaus was the first\r\n     to move the earth from the center of the universe and move it\r\n     through the void; afterwards, Aristarchus of Samos and then\r\n     Copernicus moved the earth with the moon. The Egyptians, as\r\n     well as Pythagoras, Ptolemy, Tycho, Riciolus, Longomontanus,\r\n     etc., thought that the sun moved through the degrees of the\r\n     ecliptic each year. But I attributed this movement to neither\r\n     earth nor sun for the movement of both is only apparent. I did\r\n     not vainly surmise the annual equilibrium in all astronomical\r\n     observations to be from the daily movement of the same axis\r\n     moved at the poles of the heavens. Nor, in like manner, is\r\n     there a better way to satisfy physical experiments. To you,\r\n     then, most cultured reader: If you, perhaps, can make any use\r\n     or draw pleasure from this most faithful description of my new\r\n     theory and the mechanical instrument, refer it first to God on\r\n     High from whom is everything that is best, and then to those\r\n     avidly awaiting this little work. Lastly, if you find any\r\n     statement less fitting; in your humanity, do not disdain to\r\n     excuse it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBorghesian Theory of the Universe\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Father Borghesi's second volume, there is a separate chapter entitled\r\n\"An Exposition of the Latest Theory of the Universe.\" This follows the\r\nintroduction to the reader, and in it Father Borghesi proposed:\r\n\r\n     That you might rightly conceive my new system of the world and\r\n     mechanically, as it were, construct it, imagine for yourself,\r\n     beneath that most happy seat of the Blessed and above all other\r\n     heavens, a kind of spherical convexity, everywhere equidistant\r\n     from the center of the earth, and endowed with absolutely no\r\n     motion.\r\n\r\n     On the inside, at two points diametrically opposite each other,\r\n     this convexity has two most sturdy poles (to speak\r\n     mechanically), projecting towards the center (which you call\r\n     the poles of the heavens), and the largest immobile semicircle,\r\n     in some manner is drawn from the center of one pole to the\r\n     center of the other. This semicircle in the middle, namely at a\r\n     point equidistant from each pole, is thought to be secured by\r\n     some sign, for example, by that \"o,\" for arranging more\r\n     perceptibly the seat of the sun (as will be shown later). This\r\n     much must be conceived first.\r\n\r\n     You must understand that imposed on these poles is the first\r\n     mobile [Primum Mobile], everywhere convex, and divided, into 12\r\n     equal parts [Dodecatemoria], by the 6 greatest circles,\r\n     intersecting each other at the centers of the poles. Then it is\r\n     divided by another equally great circle, everywhere equidistant\r\n     from the poles, into two hemispheres. One hemisphere of 12\r\n     parts, proceeding in order from west [setting] to east [rising]\r\n     should be assigned the respective signs of the zodiac; that is,\r\n     one to Aries, the next to Taurus, and so on, etc. The circle\r\n     which cuts those 12 parts transversely in the middle, you call\r\n     the ecliptic. Then, these capital spaces of the Primum Mobile\r\n     are subdivided by degrees, minutes, etc., both in longitude and\r\n     in latitude, so that this heaven represents a kind of great\r\n     spherical net, extended to capture the longitude and latitude\r\n     of the stars, and Mobile on the aforementioned poles. Note,\r\n     however (and this is almost the leading point of the system),\r\n     in that circle of longitude which divides the sign of Gemini\r\n     from Cancer and Arcitenens [Sagittarius] from Capricorn, you\r\n     must conceive two points, directly opposite each other and\r\n     removed about twenty-three and a half degrees from the poles:\r\n     Boreal [the northern] between Gemini and Cancer; Austral [the\r\n     southern] between Sagittarius and Capricorn. These two points\r\n     by some power (imagine it is magnetic power), equal between\r\n     them, hold the terraqueous orb suspended in the middle, by\r\n     acting on the axis of the same orb (imagine it is iron) in such\r\n     a way that the earth is continually drawn to those two points\r\n     as to two opposite centers. It is never nearer to one, for as\r\n     it is about to move towards one, the opposite power is\r\n     constantly drawing it back. Thus, both those points and the\r\n     axis of the earth are always held in one common line, wherever\r\n     those points happen to be carried by the rotation of this\r\n     heaven.\r\n\r\n     Again, it is necessary for you to conceive in this heaven,\r\n     first, two great circles, bisecting each other at right angles\r\n     in the centers of these two magnets. One of these circles,\r\n     passing through the first point of Aries and Libra in the\r\n     ecliptic, is called equinoctial colure: the other circle,\r\n     passing consequently between the first point of Cancer and\r\n     Capricorn, is called solstitial colure. Beneath these are\r\n     likewise imagined many other great circles, in the centers of\r\n     the magnets dividing crosswise in the shape of an \"X.\" But if,\r\n     receding from these magnets, you describe circles (parallel to\r\n     each other and ever greater and greater, up to the greatest\r\n     circle which you will perceive is called the equator),\r\n     equidistant from each magnet and obliquely splitting the\r\n     ecliptic in the equinoctial colure, you can then behold a\r\n     great, new, woven net in this heaven of the Primum Mobile. This\r\n     net most beautifully expands to extract the straight ascent and\r\n     descent of the stars, etc., from the vast ocean of the heavens,\r\n     catching the straight ascent in the greatest circles and, in\r\n     other unequal circles, parallel to each other and obliquely\r\n     cutting across, most safely catching the descent.\r\n\r\n     Immediately below the Primum Mobile place the heaven of the\r\n     fixed stars (and, that the idea might be clearer), revolving\r\n     separately on the same poles on which the Primum Mobile\r\n     revolves. Through this heaven, the filaments of the little\r\n     nets, etc., seem to the eyes of you on earth as if they shine.\r\n     In this heaven, you should conceive in their fixed places, the\r\n     fixed stars, a proportionate, inviolable distance from each\r\n     other, and, indeed, if you will, the heavenly images, etc.,\r\n     depicted, and all carried along at the same time with their\r\n     heaven by one motion.\r\n\r\n     Conceive a straight line running from the center of the earth\r\n     to that sign \"o\" noted in the semicircle of the supreme\r\n     immobile heaven. On this line, greatly below the heaven of the\r\n     fixed stars, place the center of the solar epicycle, holding an\r\n     area in common with the ecliptic and subject to absolutely no\r\n     motions, but at such a distance from the center of the earth\r\n     that the semidiameter of the earth has little, if any,\r\n     proportion with the distance of the solar epicycle from the\r\n     earth. Around the sun, moving continually in this epicycle (its\r\n     immobile palace) through the degrees of the anomaly, you can\r\n     revolve, with motions proportionate to the system, the five\r\n     planets: Mercury and Venus (the nearest barons of the sun),\r\n     then Mars, Jupiter and, most remote, Saturn, with its\r\n     respective satellites, etc., eccentrically surrounding the\r\n     earth itself and the moon in their immense ambit and wandering\r\n     by their proper motions through the zodiac.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless, not far from the earth you should imagine\r\n     fabricated, as from most refined crystal, the heaven of the\r\n     moon everywhere equidistant from the center of the earth and\r\n     revolving separately on the same poles (prolonged even to this\r\n     place) on which the Primum Mobile and the heaven of the fixed\r\n     stars revolve. In the middle of this, that is, in some point\r\n     equally removed from the poles, you place the center of the\r\n     lunar epicycle, movable also by the common rotation of the\r\n     lunar heaven. I refrain from the other movements of the moon in\r\n     latitude, etc., as also those of the five planets, etc., which\r\n     the theory in no way excludes, lest by a variety of congested\r\n     motions explained too abundantly, either you might be confused\r\n     about the fundamental concept of the system or, while adorning\r\n     the theory and trying to embellish the least things more\r\n     widely, you might reject also the things which are capital.\r\n\r\n     Here you already have the whole machine, but still inert and to\r\n     be animated for the first time by motions accommodated to the\r\n     system. Nevertheless, before I assign motion to the individual\r\n     parts of the world, so that the thing might later appear more\r\n     clearly to you, I arrange all things thus: first, as if by\r\n     hand, I turn the Primum Mobile until the Boreal magnetic point\r\n     comes to the level or the area of the semicircle described in\r\n     the supreme immobile convexity; then I turn the heaven of the\r\n     fixed stars until, for example, the heel of Castor (a star of\r\n     the third magnitude), almost in the ecliptic and indeed in our\r\n     time not far distant from the solstitial colure, likewise falls\r\n     nearly at the level of the aforesaid semicircle. Later, I turn\r\n     the lunar heaven until I bring the center of the lunar epicycle\r\n     to the same level. Then, I turn the earth until some\r\n     predetermined city, for example, Trent, situated in the\r\n     northern zone with a latitude of about forty-six degrees, is\r\n     brought to the oft-mentioned level.\r\n\r\n     From things arranged in this way and from what has gone before,\r\n     it is evident (with the motions of the luminaries in epicycles\r\n     left out, however, lest you be distracted by the explanation)\r\n     that at Trent, just as in the whole northern hemisphere, it is\r\n     the summer solstice; and, conversely, in the southern\r\n     hemisphere, it is the winter solstice. The reason is because\r\n     the northern magnetic point together with the northern half of\r\n     the earthly axis is at its highest point towards the sun,\r\n     immovably residing in a line sent through the level of the\r\n     highest semicircle; and, conversely, the southern magnetic\r\n     point with the corresponding half of the axis is most removed\r\n     from the same. It further follows, that noonday and the new\r\n     moon coincide, and the heel of Castor almost reaches the\r\n     summit, etc.\r\n\r\n     Now, beginning from this hypothetical situation of the whole\r\n     world as from the root of the motions, I move all things in\r\n     their circles so that the earth turns on its axis with a\r\n     revolving motion from west to east in each 24 hours of median\r\n     time. The lunar heaven completes one circle around its poles\r\n     likewise from west to east in the time of 29 terrestrial\r\n     revolutions, hours 12.44.3.13.1. The sphere of the fixed stars\r\n     on the same poles revolves once from east to west within 365\r\n     revolutions of the earth, hours 6.9.29.1. The Primum Mobile on\r\n     the poles (common to the heaven of the fixed stars and the\r\n     heaven of the moon), is moved once in the same way from east to\r\n     west, a little faster, however, than the heaven of the fixed\r\n     stars, yet within 365 revolutions of the earth, hours 5.48.56;\r\n     that is, within a median astronomical year.\r\n\r\n     Now, behold for yourself a new world supported on new poles and\r\n     provided with new motions and laws. Now you, reader and lover\r\n     of the stars, turn it, and revolve it as long as it pleases\r\n     you, and compare it astronomically and physically with the\r\n     Copernican or the Tychonian systems or with whatever one\r\n     pleases you more, and judge which one seems more consonant with\r\n     nature when all things are examined. But if you aren't able to\r\n     reconcile this theory with some astronomical observations or\r\n     physical experiments and think it should be eliminated from\r\n     the group of theories, see that I might know this while life is\r\n     still my companion, so that I might think with you, if this is\r\n     possible. Also, so that, in gratitude for the detected or\r\n     perhaps hidden error, I might speak or write, and you won't\r\n     have to shout in vain in bold ridicule and with no applause\r\n     after the fleeing shades of the dead and the mute ashes. But,\r\n     if you object that the daily motion of the revolving earth and\r\n     the annual motion of its whirling axis do not sufficiently\r\n     agree with certain texts of Sacred Scripture, and if those\r\n     things which the Copernicans and the Longomontanists say do not\r\n     convince you, then reject my whole system as an old wives'\r\n     tale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\nANOMOLIA or anomaly, is the angular distance of a planet from its\r\nperihelion (that point of the orbit of a planet which is nearest to the\r\nsun) as seen from the sun.\r\n\r\nAEQUINOCTIUM or the equinox, is the time in which days and nights are\r\nequal in the space of hours. There are two equinoxes: the spring\r\nequinox--c. 8 calends of April in the sign of Aries; and the fall\r\nequinox--c. 10 calends of October in the sign of Libra.\r\n\r\nAERAS is derived from _aera_, _aerae_, which originally meant a given\r\nnumber, usually used in regard to money. The word was later extended to\r\nmean a number used in any calculation, and finally it came to mean a\r\ncertain time from which subsequent times were counted, e.g., _Anno\r\nDomini_, after the Birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nCOLURI or the Colures, which are two circles in the heavenly sphere,\r\npassing through the poles of the world and cutting each other at right\r\nangles: the one passes through the equinoctial points of Aries and Libra\r\nand is called _Colurus Aequinoctiorum_ or equinoctial colure; the other\r\ntouches the _solstitialia_ of Cancer and Capricorn and is called\r\n_Colurus Solstitiorum_ or solstitial colure. They are called _Colurus_,\r\nwhich is translated as \"mutilated tails,\" for the part which emerges in\r\nthe Antarctic is not visible and is quasitruncated.\r\n\r\nECLIPTICA or the ecliptic, is an imaginary line in the heavens in which\r\nthe sun was supposed to have performed its annual course.\r\n\r\nEPICYCLUS or epicycle, is a small orb which, being fixed in the deferent\r\nof a planet, is carried along with its motion and yet, with its own\r\npeculiar motion, carries the body of the planet fastened to it round\r\nabout its proper center.\r\n\r\nIRIS or the rainbow. In mythology, Iris was the daughter of Thaumatis\r\nand Electra, messenger of Juno of the goddesses and Jove of the gods.\r\n\r\nSOLSTITIUM or the solstice, is that time when the sun seems to stand\r\nstill for a short time: when the sign of Cancer enters the month of June\r\n(equivalent to the summer solstice, when the sun begins to recede from\r\nus); and when the sign of Capricorn enters the month of December\r\n(equivalent to the winter solstice, when the sun begins to accede to\r\nus).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast Years\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a break in the story of Borghesi and Bertolla for the next five\r\nyears. The second clock may have been the last project on which the\r\npriest and the clockmaker worked together, for very good reasons. The\r\ntwo clocks must have represented a considerable financial investment in\r\nmaterials and in time, and neither of the men was in sufficiently\r\naffluent circumstances to undertake the luxury of such a hobby without\r\nsome form of recompense. The publication of the two little volumes must\r\nhave also been done at Father Borghesi's expense. The income of the\r\nparish priest in a small mountain village could not have been equal to\r\nthe relatively great costs of the projects that had been completed. It\r\nseems probable that the priest attempted to sell his clocks to a wealthy\r\npatron, perhaps the Baron of Cles, or he may have attempted to obtain\r\nsome form of recompense for the continuation of his research. However,\r\nno records can be found of such patronage if it existed. If Borghesi had\r\nreceived financial assistance while the projects were in progress, he\r\nwould certainly have made adequate mention of the patron's name and\r\nassistance in one or the other of the two volumes which he\r\npublished.[17]\r\n\r\nThe next record relating to Borghesi which has been found is the\r\ndescription of a letter written by an anonymous mathematician late in\r\n1768 or early in 1769. It was 28 pages in length, written in Latin, in\r\nthe form of a reply to the writer's brother, on the subject of the clock\r\ninvented by Borghesi. It consisted primarily of a criticism launched\r\nagainst Borghesi's first little volume published in 1763.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous letter is without date, place, or signature. This writer\r\nclaimed that Father Borghesi had made many errors in his book,\r\npresumably in the description of the clock's functions, and in the basic\r\ntheories upon which the priest had predicated his research. No complete\r\ncopy of the letter's text has been found for study, although it is\r\ndescribed at length in Tovazzi's _Biblioteca Tirolese_. Tovazzi noted\r\nthat four copies of the letter existed at that time, and that he\r\npersonally had filed one in the Biblioteca di Cles in Trent. However,\r\nevery attempt to locate a copy at the present time has been\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIf the anonymous letter was brought to the attention of Father Borghesi,\r\nit must have introduced a disturbing note into his life and cost the\r\npriest many unhappy moments. He was not, however, dissuaded from his\r\npreoccupation with horology. Several years later, in 1773, Father\r\nBorghesi was working on yet another astronomical clock, this time\r\npresumably without the assistance of Bertolla. This third clock was\r\nreported by Tovazzi to have been \"of minimum expense but of maximum\r\ningenuity.\"\r\n\r\nNo subsequent information relating to it has come to light, and there is\r\nno record that it was actually completed.\r\n\r\nAgain there is a period of silence in the life of Father Borghesi which\r\nno amount of research has yet been able to pierce. Whatever the\r\ncircumstances may have been, it is reported by several of the sources\r\nnoted that both the first and the second clock did, in fact, become the\r\nproperty of the Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna. The presentation was\r\nmade sometime during the period between the completion of the second\r\nclock in 1764 and the year 1780. There is some discrepancy in the\r\ncontemporary accounts as to whether Father Borghesi presented one or two\r\nclocks to the Empress, but all the sources with but one exception record\r\nthat both clocks were acquired by the Empress.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful that Father Borghesi had originally intended to give his\r\nclocks to the Empress at the time that they were made, for he would most\r\ncertainly have made some mention of such an intention in the two little\r\nvolumes which he published about them. If he saw the letter published by\r\nthe anonymous mathematician in late 1768 or 1769, it is possible that he\r\ndecided to make the presentation in expiation of his sense of guilt for\r\nthe amount of his time which the creation of the timepieces had\r\nconsumed. On the other hand, it is just as possible that Father Borghesi\r\nmay have forwarded copies of his two little volumes to the Imperial\r\nCourt at Vienna, and that the Empress expressed a desire to acquire the\r\nclocks.\r\n\r\nFather Tovazzi states that in 1780 \"the clock invented by him [Borghesi]\r\nwas preserved in Vienna, Austria, at the Imperial Court from which the\r\ninventor was receiving an annual pension of 400 florins.\" No records in\r\nthe Palace archives relating to the clock have yet been found, nor\r\nrecords of payment of an annuity to Father Borghesi. However, a more\r\nexhaustive investigation of the Furniture Depository of the Imperial\r\nCourt may bring forth related records. It was the implication in Father\r\nTovazzi's account that the second clock had been presented to the\r\nEmpress prior to the publication of the anonymous, critical letter in\r\n1768 or 1769. He believed that it was envy of Father Borghesi's\r\ningenuity, fame and financial benefit that had caused the anonymous\r\nmathematician to publish his letter, for Tovazzi asked \"Who would have\r\nencountered opposition to such a marvel? Envy is not yet dead, and has\r\nalways reigned.\"\r\n\r\nThis last-mentioned theory about the presentation may be the most likely\r\none. Some evidence may be found in the second clock itself which bears\r\nout this assumption. The multiple chapter ring, with its many\r\ninscriptions, is engraved and silvered in a relatively crude manner,\r\npresumably by Bertolla himself. The main dial plate, however, which is\r\nof gilt brass, is engraved with the utmost skill by one of the great\r\nmasters of the art. The inscription below the Imperial Hapsburg eagle\r\nrelates to Francis I, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. It is entirely\r\npossible that although Father Borghesi originally had no intention of\r\ngiving the clock to the Emperor or the Empress at the time that it was\r\nmade, he later changed his mind. Accordingly, he may have commissioned a\r\nmaster engraver, possibly in Trent or in Vienna itself, to produce a\r\ndial plate which would be of such a quality as to be worthy of the\r\nEmperor himself. If so, this was done shortly after the clock was\r\ncompleted, for the Emperor died in August of the following year. Perhaps\r\nby the time that the clock was ready, the Emperor had already died, and\r\nFather Borghesi gave the clock instead to Maria Theresa without revising\r\nthe inscription.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of the clocks by the Empress, and the annuity which was\r\nhis reward, would have constituted considerable honor even for one of\r\nthe foremost clockmakers of the Empire, but for a humble parish priest\r\nin a little village, such notable Imperial recognition was overwhelming.\r\nPossibly as a result of it, a change was noted in Father Borghesi in the\r\nnext few years. His conscience began to bother him, and he began to\r\nquestion whether he had done right in spending so much of his time and\r\nthought on his horological research. He became more and more confused in\r\nhis own mind. Had he spent too much time in mechanical studies to the\r\nneglect of his ecclesiastical duties? If this had been the case, he had\r\ncommitted the most grievous sin.\r\n\r\nExaggerated though these thoughts may appear, they were undoubtedly of\r\nthe most critical importance to the middle-aged priest. His mental\r\nturbulence and confusion increased daily, and it soon became apparent to\r\nothers around him. By June 1779, he was completely in the grip of his\r\nobsession, and his parishioners began to whisper amongst themselves that\r\ntheir pastor was being tortured by the devil. They were unable to help\r\nhim, and he became more and more preoccupied with his problem. The years\r\npassed slowly as the pastor became more vague and more tortured by his\r\nconscience.[18]\r\n\r\nThere probably was continued contact between Father Borghesi and\r\nBertolla for at least some time after the development of his illness.\r\nBertolla had retired from active work, but continued to pursue his\r\ninterests in his clockshop as much as his health and advanced years\r\npermitted. A clock which he made at the age of 80 survives and is\r\ndescribed and illustrated in the following section on \"The Clocks of\r\nBartolomeo Antonio Bertolla.\" Finally, on January 15, 1789, Bertolla\r\npassed away and Father Borghesi was left alone, deprived of the\r\ncompanionship he had enjoyed with the older man for the past two or\r\nthree decades. One of Bertolla's nephews continued to work in the master\r\nclockmaker's workshop, but there did not appear to be any association\r\nbetween the younger man and Father Borghesi.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1794, Father Borghesi lost his sanity completely, and he was\r\nforced to relinquish his pastoral duties to a curate. For the remaining\r\neight years of his life, he continued to live in the rectory of the\r\nlittle parish church in Mechel where most of his life had been spent,\r\nhis needs undoubtedly attended by the parishioners he could no longer\r\nserve. During this period, until his death at the age of 79 on June 12,\r\n1802, Father Borghesi lived on, oblivious of those around him.\r\nSeemingly, he retired to another world; perhaps to that universe which\r\nhe had tried to reproduce in his second clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clocks of Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity displayed in the Borghesi clock by its constructor,\r\nBartolomeo Antonio Bertolla, requires a consideration of the other\r\nexamples of his work that have survived. The most important of his\r\nclocks are probably the one in the Episcopal Palace at Trent and another\r\nmade for the Baron of Cles.\r\n\r\nThe one which survives in the Episcopal Palace to the present time, is\r\nextremely tall and is housed in an elaborately decorated narrow case of\r\nblack or ebonized wood approximately 9 to 10 feet in height. The upper\r\npart of the case is decorated with elaborately carved and gilt rococo\r\nmotifs. The movement operates for one year at a winding, indicates and\r\nstrikes the hours, and shows the lunar phases. It has an alarm, and will\r\nrepeat the strike at will, indicating the number of the past hour and\r\nthe quarters. The gilt brass dial is decorated with silver-foliated\r\nscrollwork in relief at the corners, inside the chapter ring, and within\r\nthe broken arch. Featured above the chapter ring is the coat of arms,\r\nexecuted in silver, of the patron for whom the clock was made,\r\nCristoforo Sizzo di Noris. Di Noris was Bishop of Trent for 13 years,\r\nfrom 1763 to 1776.\r\n\r\nThe clock which Bertolla made for the Baron of Cles is a tall, narrow,\r\ncase clock of ebony or ebonized pearwood which is approximately 9-1/2\r\nfeet in height. The decoration of the case is considerably more\r\nconservative than the one made for Di Noris, but the black wood is\r\ndecorated with silver trim and carved designs in the wood itself. The\r\ndial is decorated with silver scrollwork and spandrels within and around\r\na raised chapter ring. The clock operates for one month at each winding,\r\nhas an alarm, indicates and strikes the hours, and will repeat the\r\nquarters. This handsome timepiece is still in the possession of the\r\ndescendants of the Baron of Cles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--TALL-CASE CLOCK BY BERTOLLA in the Episcopal\r\nPalace in Trent, made for Bishop Cristoforo Sizzo di Noris.

(_Courtesy\r\nof Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnica, Milan._)]\r\n\r\nAccording to Pippa,[19] certain characteristics become apparent in a\r\nstudy of the surviving clocks by Bertolla. The tall-case clocks are\r\nnarrow and range in height from 7-3/4 feet to 10-1/2 feet. The cases had\r\nthis excessive height in order to obtain the greatest fall for the month\r\nand year movements which Bertolla constructed. For the weight assembly,\r\nhe substituted a drum wound with a key at the point of the driving wheel\r\nin place of the customary pulley. The addition of an intermediate wheel\r\naugmented the drop of the weight.\r\n\r\nBertolla's movements were solidly constructed from well-hammered brass\r\nand iron. He favored the recoil anchor escapement in his clocks and the\r\nGraham dead-beat anchor escapement with a seconds' pendulum. The\r\nescapement was not always placed in the traditional location in the\r\nupper center between the plates. Bertolla occasionally displaced the\r\npendulum to one side, to the lower part of the movement or placed it\r\nentirely between two other small plates.[20]\r\n\r\nHe utilized every type of striking work, including the music-box\r\ncylinder common in the clocks of the Black Forest and the rack and\r\nsnail. Bertolla most frequently employed the hour strike and _grand\r\nsonnerie_. He often used a single hammer on two bells of different sound\r\nwith the rack and snail. An example of this type is the clock he\r\nproduced at the age of 80. To achieve the necessary axis of rotation for\r\nthe hammer, which is perpendicular to the plate when it strikes the\r\nhours, it moves to an oblique position and displaces one of the two long\r\npins in an elongated opening.\r\n\r\nBertolla's dial plates were generally well executed, with a raised or\r\nseparate chapter ring applied to a brass or copper plate, such as a\r\ncopper-plate _repoussé_ and gilt with baroque motifs, or upon a smooth\r\nbrass plate with spandrels of _repoussé_ work usually of silver, in\r\nrelief and attached. The engraving of the chapter rings was excellent.\r\nThe hands were well executed in steel or perforated bronze, and\r\noccasionally of _repoussé_ copper; gilt was applied to the hands made of\r\nforged steel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26.--DIAL PLATE of a brass lantern clock made by\r\nBertolla, found in his workshop after his death. (_Courtesy of Museo\r\nNazionale della Scienza e della Tecnica, Milan._)]\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, Bertolla's home workshop passed from one\r\ngeneration to another within the family. Inevitably, it underwent many\r\nmodifications until the only original part of the building that remained\r\nintact from Bertolla's time was his clockshop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.--MOVEMENT of a brass lantern clock made by\r\nBertolla. (_Courtesy of Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnica,\r\nMilan._)]\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years, the workshop room was acquired complete with\r\ncontents from Bertolla's descendants, and installed in the Museo\r\nNazionale della Scienza e della Tecnica in Milan as an exhibit of a\r\ntypical 18th-century clockmaker's shop. The original workshop was\r\ndismantled in Mocenigo di Rumo and completely rebuilt in the museum,\r\nincluding the walls, ceiling and floor. The paneling and woodwork of the\r\nwalls and ceiling, which have been preserved intact, are hand-cut fir,\r\nwith columns, trim and moldings carved by hand. A small painting is\r\nfeatured in the center of the coffered ceiling. The original shop\r\nbenches and chests of drawers are set around the reconstructed shop and\r\nBertolla's tools and equipment laid out as they had been originally.\r\nOther clockmaker's tools and equipment in the museum's collection are\r\nalso displayed. Approximately 40 percent of the tools are the original\r\nitems from Bertolla's shop. Parts of clocks and works in progress are\r\non view on the benches as they were in Bertolla's time.[21] Also\r\npreserved in the museum are sketches found in Bertolla's manuscripts,\r\nsome of which are reproduced on the following pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28.--DETAIL OF WALL of Bertolla's workshop, with\r\nregulatory clock made by his nephew, Alessandro Bertolla of Venice.

The dial indicates the days of the\r\nweek and of the month, the names of the months and lunar phases. The\r\nclock strikes the hours and quarters and repeats. (_Courtesy of Sig.\r\nLuigi Pippa of Milan._)]\r\n\r\nThe shop contains two completed clocks made by Bertolla. One is a\r\nweight-driven lantern clock typical of the 18th century, Italian style\r\nwith brass dial, plates and posts, anchor escapement, and striking\r\nwork. The dial is engraved in the usual style of Bertolla's baroque\r\ndesign, and the hands are of pierced bronze. Another clock associated\r\nwith Bertolla and found in the shop, was made by his nephew, Alessandro\r\nBertolla, who worked in Venice after his apprenticeship with his uncle\r\nhad been completed. This clock is a regulator with a seconds' pendulum\r\nand sweep hand on an enameled dial. The original case has not survived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--LAYOUT OF THE WHEELWORK of a clock made by\r\nBertolla for His Excellency Paulo Dona, inscribed \"Design No. 1.\"\r\n(_Courtesy of Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnica, Milan._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31.--PENDULUM ARRANGEMENT SKETCH for an\r\nunidentified clock found in Bertolla's workshop.

This timepiece\r\nindicates the hours, minutes and quarters by means of a single hand or\r\nindex. The weight-driven clock strikes the hours and quarters on two\r\nbells with a single hammer. The chapter ring, which is soldered to the\r\ndial plate, is marked for the minutes on the outer rim and for the four\r\nquarters inside it. Over the center of it, is a semicircular opening in\r\nthe dial plate through which is visible a revolving disk attached behind\r\nthe dial plate. This disk is marked with the hours and revolves from\r\nright to left, the current hour being indicated by a projection from the\r\nminute ring. The brass dial plate is engraved with simple floral\r\ndesigns in the corners and around the broken arch. There is no\r\ncomparison between this crude and simple decoration and the extremely\r\nfine quality of the engraving on the dial plate of the Borghesi clock,\r\nfor instance. In the center of the dial plate is engraved the following:\r\n\r\n     \"Questo orologio l'ideai e lo feci nella mia avanzata età\r\n     d'anni 80.

According to Father F. X. Winters, S.J., it may\r\n        represent \"sit planetis\" or \"sit planetarum.\" The use of an\r\n        abbreviation was necessary to prevent the addition of another\r\n        letter I or M, which would have disturbed the formation of the\r\n        chronogram desired. Literally, \"sit planetis\" means \"May he be\r\n        eternal ruler _by_ [or _through_] favor of the planets,\" while\r\n        \"sit planetarum\" is to be translated \"May he be eternal ruler\r\n        _of_ the planets.\" Father Winters considered both versions\r\n        somewhat overexaggerated and proposed that the best translation\r\n        might be \"Long Live Francis I, Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n  [15]  The word \"Tempe\" refers to the Vale of Tempe, in Thessaly,\r\n        through which the Peneus River flows. It is between Mounts\r\n        Olympus and Ossa, and is situated between the town of Larissa\r\n        and the sea. In mythology, it is told that these mounts were\r\n        originally joined and Hercules separated them to allow the river\r\n        to pass between them. The word \"Tempe\" is also used to mean any\r\n        pleasant place. Thus, the inscription \"Tempe indesinenter\r\n        clausa, Scaturigo signata\" is literally translated \"Tempe always\r\n        closed, A fount of water sealed up\" or, freely translated, as \"A\r\n        garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up.\"\r\n\r\n  [16]  \"Phoebi\" or Phoebus, called Apollo, the sun god; Phoebes or\r\n        Diana, the moon goddess, sister of Apollo.\r\n\r\n  [17]  PIPPA, op. cit.

Immediately below are five numbers, divided into the days of\r\nsetting the measure of the mean-synodic age of the moon, and into signs,\r\ndegrees of the signs, and of the distance of the moon from the sun.\r\nThese, in each revolution, revolve once around the solar disk\r\nsuperimposed on the mean synodic-lunar disk, and also around the lunar\r\ndisk. The upper indices, meanwhile, in the two external greatest orbits,\r\nmeasure the time continuously, in the accustomed manner of the\r\nGermans--the middle index measuring by hours and the uppermost by the\r\nfirst minutes [of hours].\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nInside these three circles, perpendicular above their center, is a small\r\nindex of the seconds of minutes. At each first minute of time, being the\r\nfastest of all, it describes the smallest orbit. Next to this are two\r\nother slightly larger circles divided into 30 degrees, one [rotating?]\r\nfrom the right, the other from the left. These two indices are arranged\r\nin such a fashion that the one rotating from the observer's left\r\ncompletes its period 12 times during one, mean, solar-astronomical year.\r\nThe one [rotating] from the right likewise completes its cycle 12 times\r\nduring the period of one mean-synodic moon. In between these, there is\r\nplaced another small sphere, divided into 40 arbitrary parts, whose dial\r\ndoes not move automatically, but is moved by hand for speeding up or\r\nslowing down the course of the time, or of the perpendicular.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDiagonally from the sides of the center of the three larger indices, six\r\nother indices revolve: three on the left from one center, and three on\r\nthe right from another. The uppermost of the three which are on the\r\nright of the observer [and which are] decorated with a small disk of the\r\nsun, runs its cycle once during a mean solar-astronomical year. The\r\nsecond measures the distance of the sun from its apogee. The third\r\nrevolves 12 times, with each lunar revolution from one node to the same\r\n[repeated] node. Under the point of the uppermost index, first lie the\r\nmonths of the year which are inscribed, and the days of each month, but\r\nhaving only 28 days assigned to February; then the signs of the zodiac,\r\nand their several degrees. The circle corresponding to the middle index,\r\nextending through the first semicircle from apogee to the lower perigee\r\nand returning through the second semicircle to the upper locations of\r\napogee, shows the true equation or eccentricity of the sun, joined with\r\nthe little equation of the moon in syzygy. [These equations are]\r\nmeasured by geometric-astronomic proportion for each distance of the\r\nsun from its apogee or perigee in degrees, and in sufficiently small\r\nparts of degrees, with the title added above in their proper places,\r\nwhether an addition is to be made to the mean location of the sun or a\r\nsubtraction from the same, so that the true longitude of the sun may be\r\ncalculated. Three circles are assigned to the lowest index, of which 30\r\ndegrees of distance of the moon from its nodes comprise the larger. The\r\nmiddle circle is based on the hypothesis of the mean invariable\r\ndiameters (that is, of the sun, the moon, and the terrestrial shadow),\r\nand is divided into hours and quarters of duration. The last circle is\r\ndivided by the trigonometric laws into the inches of magnitude of lunar\r\neclipses. Lying between these circles, there is another eccentric circle\r\n(black with a spot) exhibiting the shadow of the earth, in which the\r\nlittle moon sinks itself, carried by the lowest index. In any ecliptic\r\nfull moons, the patent number of inches of immersion somehow affects the\r\nminds of the cultured, but also the scheme of maximum obscuration\r\naffects the eyes of the illiterate themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOf the three indices which revolve from the left, the uppermost\r\ncompletes its cycle within 12 hours, just as the hour index. The middle\r\none with two pointers on diametrically opposite sides, carries the marks\r\nof conjunction and opposition of the luminous bodies, with a movement\r\nequal to the course of the sun from lunar apogee or perigee. The lowest\r\nindex, fitted with a single pointer, indicates the motion of the moon\r\nfrom its apogee or perigee. Under these three indices, there is situated\r\na common circle, divided into 12 parts, each of which are further\r\ndivided into 30 parts through its outer circumference. I have said a\r\ncommon circle, for, with respect to the first index, the division\r\nrepresents 12 hours, and the double subdivision representing the double\r\nset of minutes of the hours serves for an excitator for anytime at all,\r\nat will. For as often as the little index reaches the twelfth hour,\r\nfirst being moved by hand wherever you prefer, a little hammer strikes\r\nthe little bell many times. But if you observe the second or the third\r\nindex, the first division provides the signs, and the subdivision of the\r\nsigns gives the individual degrees of the distance of the sun from the\r\nlunar apogee, or of the moon from its apogee, respectively. To this is\r\nadded two other interior circles from the same center: to the larger is\r\ninserted the equation of the center of the moon in its conjunctions and\r\noppositions; and on the smaller the equation of the same moon in its\r\nquarters, astronomically-geometrically proportioned to the distance of\r\nthe moon from its apogee or perigee. In the first case, the equation is\r\nto be subtracted from the mean longitude of the moon, descending from\r\napogee to perigee; in the second case, to be added to the mean longitude\r\nof the moon ascending from perigee to apogee; and, in the third\r\nsemicircle of the index, as the rubric directs, common to both\r\nequations, added around the center.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nPerpendicularly under the center of the machine, two other indices are\r\ncarried about one and the same center. The one nearer to the\r\nobserver--bearing in one of two points diametrically opposite the small\r\ndisk of the sun, in the other the disk of the moon--runs a course equal\r\nto the motion of the sun from the head or the tail of the dragon\r\n(_Draco_). The other, of simple construction, marked with a small moon,\r\nsignifies in like manner the motion of the moon from the head or the\r\ntail of the dragon.\r\n\r\nImmediately below, there is a larger circle, common [referring] to both\r\nthese indices, which is divided into 12 parts. Each of these parts in\r\nturn, in the outer periphery, is subdivided further into 30 parts, which\r\nare the 12 signs of the zodiac and the individual degrees of the signs\r\nof distance of the sun and the moon from the head of the dragon.\r\n\r\nIn the second circle is read the latitude of the moon, measured by\r\ndegrees, etc., on a trigonometric scale, by signs and degrees of\r\ndistance of the moon from its nodes, that is, from the head or tail of\r\nthe dragon. When the second index is descending from the head of the\r\ndragon to the tail, the latitude will be to the north of the solar path;\r\nthat is, the ecliptic. On the other hand, it will be south of the\r\necliptic when the same index is returning upward from the tail to the\r\nhead of the dragon as advised by the title inscribed on the third\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the fourth and last circle are seen more prime minutes of\r\nthe circle for reducing the orbit of the moon to the ecliptic. That the\r\ntrue longitude of the moon may be obtained more accurately, these must\r\nbe subtracted from the longitude of the moon already calculated in the\r\nfirst and third quadrant of the circle of the second index. On the other\r\nhand, they are to be added to the same in the second and fourth\r\nquadrant, as is noted in their respective places, according to the\r\ntheory of right ascensions.\r\n\r\nHere, then, [you have] as finally completed, delineation of the great\r\nindex which was partially described before in this book.\r\n\r\nFrom two points of that index which perpendicularly correspond to the\r\ncenter of these circles, a pair of compasses, by an unvaried aperture up\r\nto the circumference of the first larger circle, has marked off four\r\nsegments of a circle. The two larger segments, equal among themselves,\r\nin one aperture refer to the sun, and the two smaller in the other,\r\nlikewise equal, refer to the moon. The one pointer is for determining\r\nthe solar eclipses; the other, for lunar. Both segments of each\r\ndivision, like little wings of the index, stretch to the extent of the\r\ndegree of distance of the moon from its nodes, and to which that\r\ndetermined latitude corresponds. On one side, that latitude precisely\r\nequals the radii of the earth, the sun, and the moon, as the termini of\r\nsolar eclipses; and, on the other side, precisely equals the radii of\r\nthe earth's shadow and of the moon, as the confines of lunar eclipses.\r\nThe apexes of the last index, diametrically limited [opposite], indicate\r\nthe age of the moon, and its mean distance from the sun; one pointer,\r\nupon which the sun sits, measuring the mean days and degrees from the\r\nfull moon; the other, on which the moon sits, measuring the mean days\r\nand degrees from the new moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nBesides the larger and smaller indices already mentioned, all [of which]\r\nrevolve within the periphery of the three largest circles, six dials in\r\nthis clock also revolve within the same circles which are to be seen\r\nthrough six openings of the frontispiece. The first of these, intended\r\nto indicate the phases of the moon by an unusual method (completely\r\nblack, and decorated with the characters of the principal aspects of the\r\nmoon) continually revolves interiorly around the center of the machine\r\nand at the new moon, it completely removes from sight the face of the\r\nmoon through the round window. It continually recedes through the first\r\nhalf of the circle until, at the time of the full moon, it restores the\r\nmoon, looking out with a full star. Soon again, too slow to be\r\nobserved, it returns through the other half of the circle, so that in\r\nthe next conjunction, the whole face of the moon may have a covering of\r\ndarkness, once again to be removed.\r\n\r\nThe other dials are moved by spontaneous advances at stated times. The\r\nfirst of these shows, through a square opening, the day of the month;\r\nthe second, through another opening, shows the current day of the week\r\nwith the characters of the seven planets which, according to ancient\r\nsuperstition, preside over each day of the week (now, by a truer form of\r\nreligion divided by the Church into ferias, etc.); that is, the sun, the\r\nmoon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, to which I have added\r\nthe numbers of the ferias. These two little dials are advanced daily, by\r\na sudden movement at midnight. The remaining three are changed\r\nautomatically only once a year on the first of January.\r\n\r\nThe first of these dials contains five little cells, opening from a\r\ncommon window: in the first cell, at the edge of the dial, is found the\r\ndominical letter; in the second, the cycle of the sun; in the third, the\r\ncharacter; in the fourth, the sign; and, in the fifth, the house of the\r\nplanet dominating the year. The second dial shows the epacts, with the\r\ngolden number. The third, and last of all, shows the Roman cycle.\r\n\r\nFinally, as indicated by the epact and the dominical letter in an\r\nimmovable table added outside, are the feastdays and other movable\r\nevents of the year; that is, Easter, the four seasons, the Rogation\r\nDays, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nBut lest the various movements of the indices and the various beginnings\r\nof the divisions tend to cause some fatigue, the precaution has been\r\ntaken, that all the indices by common law are moved from the top towards\r\nthe right of the observer, and from thence all the arithmetic divisions\r\nof the circles take their beginning. And lest the multitude of different\r\nfigures should deceive the eye, the larger divisions of the circles have\r\nbeen marked by Roman numbers, that is, by capital letters of the\r\nalphabet; others, in other places, by differently colored numbers. Thus,\r\nthe movements of the indices, the distribution of the circles and the\r\nmultitude of numbers not only do not disturb the eyes and the mind, but\r\nrather marvelously delight them.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nAfter having completed briefly the description of the dial and the\r\nindices and their motions, I have not without reason delayed in\r\nsatisfying the desires of many who wish to learn at least the method by\r\nwhich, from this mechanism, may be calculated the true times of new and\r\nfull moons, and their ecliptics. In order to make these matters clearer,\r\nit is necessary that they be explained here at greater length.\r\n\r\nWith the indices, then, adjusted astronomically-geographically to the\r\nlongitude of any given region, and to the mean time whether past,\r\npresent or future, and assuming the clock to be in normal operation (as\r\nat present it has been for a whole year and more), then the moon will be\r\nin conjunction with the sun in the heavens. When the equations on the\r\nmechanism are examined, the sun and moon shall be found to be in the\r\nsame degree of longitude, and in the same part of a degree. There will\r\nalso be an ecliptic new moon that is in conjunction with a solar\r\neclipse, or rather with a terrestrial eclipse. This will occur if, at\r\nthat time, both apexes of the first index, located below the center of\r\nthe clock, are hidden by the two segments of the circle extending from\r\nthe center of the mechanism through the lowest index.\r\n\r\nAnd the eclipse will be greater and greater and, consequently, visible\r\nin more regions of the earth, the more deeply the two pointers,\r\nindicating the distance of the sun from its apogee, are hidden in the\r\ncenter of the segments.\r\n\r\nBut whether the eclipse takes place in the head or in the tail of the\r\ndragon, or whether it is north or south, is indicated by the small disk\r\nof the sun attached to one of the two pointers hidden by the segments of\r\nthe circle. If, at that time, the little disk shall be found in the head\r\nof the dragon inscribed on the plane of the dial, then the sun has been\r\nsnatched from the earth and ingloriously entombed, as it were, in the\r\nhuge jaw of the dragon. Then, ... the heavens themselves will lend aid\r\nto the woeful pomp of the senseless funeral in full darkness by suddenly\r\nlighting the unhappy lamps of the fixed stars. However, if the little\r\ndisk occupies the tail of the dragon on the mechanism, then the sun in\r\nthe heavens also, as if freed from the toils of the immense dragon's\r\ntail, will emerge without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe center of the eclipse will traverse the hemisphere of the earth\r\nnorth of the solar path, always nearer to the pole of the ecliptic, in\r\nproportion to the inclination of the disk to the north. On the other\r\nhand, if the little disk inclines to the left semicircle, then the\r\npeople south of the solar path will enjoy the spectacle of the total\r\ncentral eclipse.\r\n\r\nBut if the little disk remains neutral (inclining neither way) and\r\nremains halfway between the two sections of the circle, then the\r\ngreatest solar eclipse will take place at the equator and those who live\r\nnear the poles of the ecliptic will not enjoy a trace of that eclipse.\r\nThis is because the half of the equatorial diameter enormously\r\noutmeasures even the greatest apparent semidiameters of the sun and of\r\nthe moon, even taking as a norm the smallest horizontal parallax of the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said about the true new moon is to be understood also,\r\nproportionately, about the true full moon. For when, with respect to the\r\nequations of the centers, the moon shall be distant on the mechanism by\r\na full semicircle from the sun (also in the heavens it will be truly in\r\nopposition to the sun) there will be a true full moon. Likewise, the\r\nmoon in the heavens will be in eclipse if, at the time of opposition,\r\nthe pointers of the little index (which we mentioned before) situated\r\nbelow the center of the clock are so far away from the belly of the\r\ndragon that they are forced to lie under the two smaller segments of the\r\ncircle which, in all full moons, are always to be moved from the index\r\nof the synodic moon to the region of that little index. As a matter of\r\nfact, the closer the little pointers approach to the middle of the\r\nsegments, the more obscured it will be.\r\n\r\nYou will know, furthermore, that the eclipse of the moon occurs in the\r\nhead of the dragon if the disk of the little moon, attached to the other\r\npoint of the little index, is raised to the head of the dragon;\r\nconversely, when the little disk of the moon inclines to the tail, the\r\neclipse is taking place in the tail of the dragon.\r\n\r\nAnd, accordingly, when you observe the little moon of the index inclined\r\nto one or other section of the circle, so also in the heavens, the\r\neclipse of the moon is only partial and the northern or the southern\r\npart of the moon is illuminated.\r\n\r\nThe current time will indicate whether the lunar eclipse is visible or\r\nnot. As the new moon ecliptic falls during the day, the eclipse will not\r\nbe visible, since the earth denies a sight of the moon which is below\r\nthe horizon. But, conversely, if there are no clouds, the eclipse will\r\nbe visible anywhere, if the luminous bodies are ecliptically in\r\nopposition at night.\r\n\r\nSince lunar eclipses appear to all people as being of the same magnitude\r\nand duration, and begin and dissipate at the same absolute moment of\r\ntime, I decided to reveal another facet of this spectacle on the right\r\nside of the center of the clock (see chapter III above). There, at the\r\ntime of the true ecliptic full moon, as the pointer of the third little\r\nindex shows, you can ascertain the hours, etc., of duration, and the\r\ninches of greatest obscuration. The little moon attached to the index is\r\na model of the actual eclipsed moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThus, with the aid of this machine, solar and lunar eclipses of the past\r\ncan be recalled and future ones can be foreseen. Indeed, if the index of\r\nprime minutes is speeded up by hand, whose wheel imparts motion to the\r\nother indices and shields, then, the dials and openings will foretell\r\nthe year, month, day, hour, etc., of any future eclipse. I foresaw that\r\nthe times would thus be evolved too slowly, and that the clock wheels\r\nwould be considerably worn by repeated experiments (if, for instance, by\r\nthe rotation of the index of prime minutes, to whose period only a\r\nsingle hour corresponds, the future new and full moon ecliptics were\r\nbeing investigated). Therefore, I took care that the wheel which\r\nimmediately communicates motion to the index of the synodic moon should\r\nbe so fitted internally to the mechanism that by the reversal of any\r\nexternal index, the wheel would be removed from its proper position;\r\nwhenever desired, it could be quickly and most accurately restored to\r\nits proper place.\r\n\r\nIn this way, since the close meshing of the wheels is released, you can\r\nextend the experiment for many years, even for many centuries. You have\r\nonly to guide with your hand the index of the synodic moon on the\r\ncircles, always intently observing whether, in the passage which this\r\nindex makes over the little index, both pointers of the little index are\r\nhidden by the segments of the circle. Having observed this, look at the\r\nindex moved by hand, for if this has carried the solar disk halfway\r\nbetween the two larger segments of the circle to the region of the\r\nhidden little index, then you will know that eclipse will be a solar\r\neclipse. On the other hand, you will know that it will be a lunar\r\neclipse, if the index (moved by hand) has carried the moon, situated\r\nbetween the two smaller segments of the circle, to the same region\r\n(i.e., the hidden part of the circle). The solar disk and the lunar disk\r\nalternately will reveal to you the circumstances of both eclipses. The\r\ncurrent year will be given by the Julian period, reducible to any\r\ndesired epoch, and, contained in the solar cycle, the golden number and\r\nthe Roman cycle. The month of the year and also the day of the month\r\nwill be indicated by the pointer of the little index, first on the right\r\nside of the clock. And what I have said of future eclipses should be\r\nequally understood of past eclipses, so long as the index, which can be\r\nmoved either way at will, is moved in reverse.\r\n\r\nFinally, though 55 wheels were employed to carry so many dials, all are\r\ndriven by one source of power not exceeding the third part of a Germanic\r\nhundred-weight which, suspended at the geometric height of five feet\r\n(about the ordinary stature of a man), keeps the whole machine in\r\noperation for a hundred days and more.\r\n\r\nAlthough the machine repeats hours and quarter hours at will and,\r\nconsequently, the number of wheels and the rest of the apparatus\r\nnecessary for these functions is thereby increased, it has not grown to\r\nan unwieldy size, however much one might erroneously imagine it to be.\r\nIt does not exceed the bulk of ordinary clocks hanging from a wall;\r\nindeed, it scarcely equals these.\r\n\r\nThe entire machine, ready for operation, does not weigh more than 156\r\nounces, although it is made of steel or brass throughout and further\r\nweighted with two bells and a rather large brass dial-plate.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many more things to be said, especially about the\r\nmechanical structure of the wheels, but fearing to tire my kind reader\r\nunduly by exceeding the bounds of a summary, I am forced to put an end,\r\nthough unwillingly, to this sufficiently shortened explanation of the\r\nwork. I have hope of giving satisfaction to many more when I shall have\r\ncommunicated to the learned world another and completely new automatic\r\nwork, grander than this present one. It is already theoretically\r\ncompleted in all its calculations, but still to be worked out\r\nmechanically from the very beginning, if but God, thrice Best and\r\nGreatest, bless the undertaking and mercifully grant life and health--to\r\nwhom be in, and from, and through all things, all honor and glory in\r\neternity and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following works have been used in compiling the material for this\r\npaper.

(_Photo\r\ncourtesy of Dr. Stuart Christhilf._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The development of structural engineering has always been as\r\n     dependent upon the availability of materials as upon the\r\n     expansion of theoretical concepts. Perhaps the greatest single\r\n     step in the history of civil engineering was the introduction\r\n     of iron as a primary structural material in the 19th century;\r\n     it quickly released the bridge and the building from the\r\n     confines of a technology based upon the limited strength of\r\n     masonry and wood._\r\n\r\n     _Wendel Bollman, self-taught Baltimore civil engineer, was the\r\n     first to evolve a system of bridging in iron to be consistently\r\n     used on an American railroad, becoming one of the pioneers who\r\n     ushered in the modern period of structural engineering._\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR: _Robert M. Vogel is curator of civil engineering in\r\n     the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and\r\n     Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\nWendel Bollman's name survives today solely in association with the\r\nBollman truss, and even in this respect is known only to a few older\r\ncivil and railroad engineers. The Bollman system of trussing, along with\r\nthose of Whipple and Fink, may be said to have introduced the great age\r\nof the metal bridge, and thus, directly, the modern period of civil\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\nBollman's bridge truss, of which the first example was built in 1850,\r\nhas the very significant distinction of being the first bridging system\r\nin the world employing iron in all of its principal structural members\r\nthat was used consistently on a railroad.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the transition from wood to iron as a structural and\r\nbridge building material is generally recognized, but it may be well to\r\nmention certain aspects of this change.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of masonry bridge construction never attained the great\r\nstrength in this country which it held in Europe, despite a number of\r\nnotable exceptions. There were several reasons for this. From the very\r\nbeginning of colonization, capital was scarce, a condition that\r\nprevailed until well into the 19th century and which prohibited the use\r\nof masonry because of the extremely high costs of labor and transport.\r\nAn even more important economic consideration was the rapidity with\r\nwhich it was necessary to extend the construction of railways during\r\ntheir pioneer years. Unlike the early English and European railways,\r\nwhich invariably traversed areas of dense population and industrial\r\nactivity, and were thus assured of a significant financial return almost\r\nfrom the moment that the first rail was down, the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nand its contemporaries were launched upon an entirely different\r\ncommercial prospect. Their principal business consisted not so much in\r\nalong-the-line transactions as in haulage between principal terminals\r\nseparated by great and largely desolate expanses. This meant that income\r\nwas severely limited until the line was virtually complete from end to\r\nend, and it meant that commencement of return upon the initial\r\ninvestment was entirely dependent upon the speed of survey, graduation,\r\ntunneling, and bridging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--MODEL OF B. H. LATROBE'S TRUSS, built in 1838,\r\nover the Patapsco River at Elysville (now Daniels), Maryland. (_Photo\r\ncourtesy of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad._)]\r\n\r\nThe need for speed, the general attenuation of capital, and the simple\r\nfact that all the early railroads traversed thickly forested areas\r\nrendered wood the most logical material for bridge and other\r\nconstruction, both temporary and permanent.\r\n\r\nThe use of wood as a bridge material did not, of course, originate with\r\nthe railroads, or, for that matter, in this country. The heavily wooded\r\nEuropean countries--Switzerland in particular--had a strong tradition of\r\nbridge construction in timber from the Renaissance on, and naturally a\r\ncertain amount of this technique found its way to the New World with the\r\ncolonials and immigrants.\r\n\r\nAmerica's highway system was meager until about the time the railroad\r\nage itself was beginning. However, by 1812 there were, along the eastern\r\nseaboard, a number of fine timber bridges of truly remarkable structural\r\nsophistication and workmanship.\r\n\r\nIt was just previous to the advent of the railroads that the erection of\r\nhighway bridges in this country began to pass from an art to a science.\r\nAnd an art it had been in the hands of the group of skilled but\r\nunschooled master carpenters and masons who built largely from an\r\nintuitive sense of proportion, stress, and the general \"fitness of\r\nthings.\" It passed into an exact science under the guidance of a small\r\nnumber of men trained at first in the scientific and technical schools\r\nof Europe, and, after about 1820, in the few institutions then\r\nestablished in America that offered technical instruction.\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of trained engineers at first affected highway\r\nbridge construction not so much in the materials used but in the way\r\nthey were assembled. In a bridge designed by a self-taught constructor,\r\nthe cheapness of wood made it entirely feasible to proportion the\r\nmembers by enlarging them to the point where there could be no question\r\nas to their structural adequacy. The trained engineer, on the other\r\nhand, could design from the standpoint of determining the entire load\r\nand then proportioning each element according to the increment of stress\r\nupon it and to the unit capacity of the material.\r\n\r\nBy the time railroads had started expanding to the West there had been\r\nsufficient experience with the half dozen practical timber truss systems\r\nby then evolved, that there was little difficulty in translating them\r\ninto bridges capable of supporting the initial light rail traffic.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its inherent shortcomings, wood was so adaptable that it met\r\nalmost perfectly the needs of the railroads during the early decades of\r\ntheir intense expansion, and, in fact, still finds limited use in the\r\nNorthwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Career\r\n\r\n\r\nWendel Bollman was born in Baltimore of German parents in 1814. His\r\nfather was a baker, who in the same year had aided in the city's defense\r\nagainst the British. Wendel's education, until about the age of 11, was\r\nmore or less conventionally gained in public and private schools in\r\nBaltimore. He then entered into informal apprenticeship, first to an\r\napothecary in Sheperdstown, Virginia (now West Virginia), and then to\r\none in Harpers Ferry. In 1826 or 1827 he became ill and returned to\r\nBaltimore for cure. From that time on his education was entirely\r\nself-acquired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--TRUSSED BEAM.]\r\n\r\nIt is of interest, in light of his later career, to note that on the\r\nFourth of July 1828, he marched with other boys in a procession that was\r\npart of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's cornerstone-laying ceremony.\r\nShortly afterward, he apprenticed himself to a carpenter for a brief\r\ntime, but when the work slacked off he obtained work with the B. & O.\r\nThe right-of-way had been graded for about five miles by that time, but\r\nno rail was down. The boy was at first given manual work, but soon\r\nadvanced to rodman and rapidly rose as he gained facility with the\r\nsurveying apparatus. In the fall of 1829 he participated in laying the\r\nfirst track. As his mother was anxious that he continue his education in\r\ncarpentry, he left the railroad in the spring of 1830 to again enter\r\napprenticeship. He finished, became a journeyman, helped build a\r\nplanter's mansion in Natchez, and returned to Baltimore in 1837 to\r\ncommence his own carpentry business. The next year, while building a\r\nhouse in Harpers Ferry, he was asked to rejoin the B. & O. to rebuild\r\nparts of its large timber bridge over the Potomac there, which had\r\nfallen victim to various defects after about a year's use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--SIMPLE BEAM of 50-foot span with three\r\nindependent trussing systems. Bollman's use of this method of support\r\nled to the development of his bridge truss. This drawing is of a\r\ntemporary span used after the timber bridge at Harpers Ferry was\r\ndestroyed during the Civil War. (In Baltimore and Ohio Collection,\r\nMuseum of History and Technology.)]\r\n\r\nShortly after the Harpers Ferry bridge reconstruction, Bollman was made\r\nforeman of bridges. It is apparent that, on the basis of his practical\r\nability, enhanced by the theoretical knowledge gained by intense\r\nself-study, he eventually came to assist Chief Engineer Benjamin H.\r\nLatrobe in bridge design. He later took this work over entirely as\r\nLatrobe's attentions and talents were demanded in the location and\r\nextension of the line between Cumberland and Wheeling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--BOLLMAN'S ORIGINAL PATENT DRAWING, 1851. (In\r\nNational Archives, Washington, D.C.)]\r\n\r\nThe B. & O. did not reach its logical destination, Ohio (actually\r\nWheeling, West Virginia, on the east bank of the Ohio River) until 1853.\r\nIn the years following Bollman's return to the railroad, the design of\r\nbridges was an occupation of the engineering staff second in importance\r\nonly to the location of the line itself. During this time Bollman\r\ncontinued to rise and assume greater responsibilities, being appointed\r\nmaster of road by Latrobe in 1848. In this position he was responsible\r\nfor all railroad property that did not move, principally the\r\nright-of-way and its structures, including, of course, bridges.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of Bollman's abilities was in the well-established\r\ntradition of the B. & O., long known as America's first \"school of\r\nengineering,\" having sponsored many early experiments in motive power,\r\ntrackwork, and other fundamental elements of railroad engineering. It\r\nfurnished the means of expression for such men as Knight, Wright,\r\nWhistler, Latrobe, and Winans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--PLAN OF HARPERS FERRY BRIDGE as built by\r\nLatrobe. The second Winchester track was later removed.]\r\n\r\nOf these pioneer civil and mechanical engineers, some were formally\r\ntrained but most were self-taught. Bollman's career on the B. & O. is of\r\nparticular interest not only because he was perhaps the most successful\r\nof the latter class but because he was probably also the last. He may be\r\nsaid to be a true representative of the transitional period between\r\nintuitive and exact engineering. Actually, his designing was a composite\r\nof the two methods. While making consistent use of mathematical\r\nanalysis, he was at the same time more or less dependent upon empirical\r\nmethods. For years, B. & O. employees told stories of his sessions in\r\nthe tin shop of the railroad's main repair facility at Mount Clair in\r\nBaltimore, where he built models of bridges from scraps of metal and\r\nthen tested them to destruction to locate weaknesses. It seems most\r\nlikely, however, that the empirical studies were used solely as checks\r\nagainst the mathematical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--RECENT MODEL of Bollman's Winchester span.\r\nOnly two of the three lines of trussing are shown. The model is based on\r\nBollman's published description and drawings of the structure. (USNM\r\n318171; Smithsonian photo 46941.)]\r\n\r\nIn the period when Bollman began designing--about 1840--there were fewer\r\nthan ten men in the country designing bridges by scientifically correct\r\nanalytical methods, Whipple and Roebling the most notable of this group.\r\nBy 1884, the year of Bollman's death, the age of intuitive design had\r\nbeen dead for a decade or longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD'S Potomac\r\nRiver crossing at Harpers Ferry, about 1860.

It was the\r\nfirst practical railroad in America; the first to use an American\r\nlocomotive; the first to cross the Alleghenies. The spirit of innovation\r\nhad been encouraged by the railroad's directors from the outset. It\r\ncould hardly have been otherwise in light of the project's elemental\r\ndaring.\r\n\r\nThe first few major bridges beyond the line's starting point on Pratt\r\nStreet, in Baltimore, were of rather elaborate masonry, but this may be\r\nexplained by the projectors' consciousness of the railroad's\r\nsignificance and their desire for permanence. However, the\r\naforementioned economic factors shortly made obvious the necessity of\r\ndeparture from this system, and wood was thereafter employed for most\r\nlong spans on the line as far as Harpers Ferry and beyond. Only the most\r\nminor culverts and short spans, and those only in locations near\r\nsuitable quarries, were built of stone.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the economic considerations which prompted the company to\r\nrevert to timber for the major bridges, there were several situations in\r\nwhich masonry construction was unsuitable for practical reasons. If\r\nstone arches were used in locations where the grade of the line was a\r\nrelatively short distance above the surface of the stream to be crossed,\r\na number of short arches would have been necessary to avoid a very flat\r\nsingle arch. In arch construction, the smaller the segment of a circle\r\nrepresented by the arch (that is, the flatter the arch), the greater the\r\nstress in the arch ring and the resulting horizontal thrust on the\r\nabutments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--BOLLMAN SKEW BRIDGE at Elysville (now\r\nDaniels), Maryland, built in 1853-1854. (_Photo courtesy of Maryland\r\nHistorical Society._)]\r\n\r\nThe piers for the numerous arches necessary to permit an optimum amount\r\nof rise relative to the span would have presented a dangerous\r\nrestriction to stream flow in time of flood. By the use of timber\r\ntrusses such crossings could be made in one or two spans with, at the\r\nmost, one pier in the stream, thus avoiding the problem.\r\n\r\nThe principal timber bridges as far west as Cumberland were of Latrobe's\r\ndesign. These were good, solid structures of composite construction, in\r\nwhich a certain amount of cast iron was used in joints and wrought iron\r\nfor certain tension members. They were, however, more empirical than\r\nefficient and, for the most part, not only grossly overdesigned but of\r\ndecidedly difficult fabrication and construction.\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting about the Latrobian timber trusses, however, is the\r\neffect they appear to have had upon Bollman's subsequent work in the\r\ndesign of his own truss. This effect is evidenced by the marked analogy\r\nbetween the primary structural elements of the two types. The Latrobe\r\ntruss at Elysville (fig. 2) was only partially a truss, inasmuch as the\r\ngreater part of the load was not carried from panel to panel, finally to\r\nappear at the abutments as a pure vertical reaction, but was carried\r\nfrom each panel (except the four at the center) directly to the bearing\r\npoints at the piers by heavy diagonal struts, after the fashion of the\r\nfamous 18th-century Swiss trusses of the Grubenmanns. It was a\r\nlegitimate structural device, and the simplest means of extending the\r\ncapacity of a spanning system. However, it was defective in that the\r\nstruts applied considerable horizontal thrust to the abutments,\r\nrequiring heavier masonry than would otherwise have been necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is quite likely that Latrobe did not have absolute confidence in the\r\nvarious pure truss systems already patented by Town, Long, and others,\r\nand preferred for such strategic service a structure in which the panel\r\nmembers acted more or less independently of one another. It will be seen\r\nthat, similarly, the individual panel loads in Bollman's truss were\r\ncarried to the ends of the frame by members acting independently of one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bollman Truss\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had never been any question about the many serious inadequacies of\r\nwood as a bridge material. Decay and fire risk, always present, were the\r\nprincipal ones, involving continuous expenditure for replacement of\r\ndefective members and for fire watches. It was, in fact, understood by\r\nthe management and engineering staff of the B. & O. that their timber\r\nbridge superstructures, though considered the finest in the country,\r\nwere more or less expedient and were eventually to be replaced. In this\r\nregard it is not surprising that Latrobe, a man of considerable\r\nforesight, had, at an early date, given serious thought to the possible\r\napplication of iron here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--POTOMAC RIVER CROSSING of the Baltimore and\r\nOhio at North Branch, Maryland, built in 1856. There are three Bollman\r\ndeck trusses. (_Photo courtesy of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--THE FINK TRUSS. (_Smithsonian photo\r\n41436._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WENDEL BOLLMAN'S\r\n\r\nPatent Iron Suspension Railroad Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned would inform the officers of Railroads and others, that\r\nhe is prepared to furnish Drawings and Estimates for Bridges, Roofs,\r\netc., on the plan of Bollman's Patent.\r\n\r\nThe performance of these bridges, some of which have been in use for six\r\nyears, has given entire satisfaction. Their simplicity of construction\r\nrenders repairs easy and cheap, and by a peculiar connection of the Main\r\nand Panel Rods at the bottom of the Posts, all danger from the effects\r\nof expansion, which has heretofore been the chief objection to Iron\r\nBridges, is entirely removed.\r\n\r\n    J. H. TEGMEYER,\r\n    Baltimore, Md.\r\n\r\nFigure 12.--ADVERTISEMENT in the _Railroad Advocate_, August 1855.]\r\n\r\nThe world's first major iron bridge, the famed cast-iron arch at\r\nCoalbrookdale, England, had been constructed in 1779. Its erection was\r\nfollowed by rather sporadic interest in this use of the material. The\r\nfirst significant use of iron in this country was in a series of small\r\ntrussed highway arches erected by Squire Whipple over the Erie Canal in\r\nthe early 1840's, over 60 years later. In these, as in most of the\r\nearlier iron structures, an arch of cast iron was the primary support.\r\nThe thrust of the arches was counteracted by open wrought-iron links\r\nwith other wrought- and cast-iron members contributing to the truss\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe Whipple bridges promoted a certain amount of interest in the\r\nmaterial. In the B. & O.'s annual report for the fiscal year 1849\r\nappears the first record of Latrobe's interest in this important matter.\r\nIn the president's message is found the following, rather offhand,\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n     $6,183.19 have been expended toward the renewal of the Stone\r\n     Bridges on the Washington Branch, carried off by the flood of\r\n     Oct. 7th, 1847. Preparations are made and contracts entered\r\n     into, for the reconstruction of the large Bridges at Little\r\n     Patuxent and at Bladensburg which will be executed in a few\r\n     months.... It is proposed to erect a superstructure of Iron\r\n     upon stone abutments, at each place--with increased span, for\r\n     greater security against future floods.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that it was indeed Bollman trusses to which\r\nthe president of the railroad had referred. How much earlier than this\r\ndate Bollman had evolved his peculiar trussing system is not clear. The\r\ncertain influence of Latrobe's radiating strut system of trussing has\r\nbeen mentioned. As likely an influence was another basic technique\r\ncommonly used to increase the capacity of a simple timber beam--that of\r\ntrussing--i.e., placing beneath the beam a rod of iron that was anchored\r\nat the ends of the beam and held a certain distance below it at the\r\ncenter by a vertical strut or post. This combination thus became a truss\r\nin that the timber portion was no longer subject to a bending stress but\r\nto a simple one of compression, the rod absorbing the tensile stress of\r\nthe combination. The effect was to deepen the beam, increasing the\r\ndistance between its extreme fibers and--by thus reducing the bending\r\nmoment--reducing the stress in them (see fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--THE FOUR BOLLMAN SPANS at Harpers Ferry that\r\nsurvived the Civil War. The spans were completed in 1862-1863. (_Photo\r\ncourtesy of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad._)]\r\n\r\nIt apparently occurred to Bollman that by extending the number of rods\r\nin a longitudinal direction, this effect could be practically amplified\r\nto such an extent as to be capable of spanning considerable distances.\r\nHe almost certainly did not at first contemplate an all-iron system, but\r\nrather a composite one such as described. It is entirely likely that\r\nsuch trussed beams, with multiple systems of tension rods, were used by\r\nBollman as bridging in temporary trestlework along the line as early as\r\n1845 (see fig. 4).\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say whether Bollman himself, or Latrobe, was struck\r\nwith the logic of further elaborating upon the system and,\r\nsimultaneously, translating the timber compression member into one of\r\ncast iron. Cast iron would naturally have been selected for a member\r\nthat resisted a compressive stress, as it was considerably cheaper than\r\nwrought iron. But more important, at that time wrought iron was not\r\navailable in shapes of sufficient sectional area to resist the\r\nappreciable buckling stresses induced in long compression members. The\r\ncost of building up members to sufficient size from the very limited\r\nselection of small shapes then rolled would have been prohibitive.\r\n\r\nThe trussing rods, subjected to tension, were of wrought iron inasmuch\r\nas the sectional area had only to be sufficient to resist the primary\r\naxial stress.\r\n\r\nThe first all-iron Bollman truss was constructed over the Little\r\nPatuxent River at Savage Factory, near Laurel, Maryland, in 1850. In the\r\nchief engineer's report for the year 1850, Latrobe was able to state\r\nthat the truss had been completed and was giving \"much satisfaction.\"\r\nHe went on at some length to praise the \"valuable mechanical features\"\r\nembodied therein, and expressed great confidence that iron would become\r\nas important a material in the field of civil engineering as it was in\r\nmechanical engineering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--THE HARPERS FERRY BRIDGE as completed after\r\nthe Civil War. It was used by the Baltimore and Ohio until 1894, and as\r\na highway bridge until 1936. (Photo 690, Baltimore and Ohio Collection,\r\nMuseum of History and Technology.)]\r\n\r\nThe cost of this first major Bollman bridge was $23,825.00. Its span was\r\n76 feet. Latrobe's confidence was well placed. The Savage span and\r\nanother at Bladensburg may be considered successful pilot models, for,\r\nin spite of a certain undercurrent of mistrust of iron bridges within\r\nthe engineering profession--due mainly to a number of failures of\r\nimproperly designed spans--Latrobe felt there was sufficient\r\njustification for the unqualified adoption of iron in all subsequent\r\nmajor bridge structures on the B. & O.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately following completion of the Savage Bridge, Bollman\r\nundertook the design of replacements for the large Patapsco River span\r\nat Elysville (now Daniels), Maryland, and the so-called Winchester span\r\nof the B. & O.'s largest and most important bridge, that over the\r\nPotomac at Harpers Ferry. Harpers Ferry bridge, a timber structure, had\r\nbeen designed by Latrobe and built in 1836-1837 by the noted bridge\r\nconstructor Lewis Wernwag. It was peculiar in having a turnout, near the\r\nVirginia shore, whereby a subsidiary road branched off to Winchester\r\n(see fig. 6). Only the single span on this line, situated between the\r\nmidriver switch and the shore, was slated for replacement, as the other\r\nseven spans of the bridge had been virtually reconstructed in the decade\r\nor so of their history and were in sound condition at the time.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester span (fig. 8), which was the first Bollman truss to\r\nembody sufficient refinement of detail to be considered a prototype, was\r\ncompleted in 1851. Bollman was extremely proud of the work, with perfect\r\njustification it may be said. The 124-foot span was fabricated in the\r\nrailroad's extensive Mount Clair shops. It was subdivided into eight\r\npanels by seven struts and seven pairs of truss rods. An interesting\r\ndifference between this span and Bollman's succeeding bridges was his\r\nuse of granite rather than cast iron for the towers. The span consisted\r\nof three parallel lines of trussing to accommodate a common road in\r\naddition to the single-track Winchester line.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of the Bollman system was the previously\r\nmentioned series of diagonal truss links in combination with a cast-iron\r\ncompression chord, which Bollman called the \"stretcher.\" The spacing\r\nbetween the chord and the junction of each pair of links was maintained\r\nby a vertical post or strut, also cast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--NORTH STREET (now Guilford Avenue) bridge,\r\nBaltimore. In this transitional composite structure cast iron was used\r\nonly in the relatively short sections of the upper chord. For the long\r\nunsupported compression members of the web system, standard wrought-iron\r\nangles and channels were built up into a large section. The decorative\r\ncast-iron end posts were non-structural. (Photo in the L. N. Edwards\r\nCollection, Museum of History and Technology.)]\r\n\r\nMuch of the appeal of this design lay unquestionably in the sense of\r\nsecurity derived from the fact that each of the systems acted\r\nindependently to carry its load to the abutments. The lower chords,\r\nactually nonfunctional in the primary structure, were included merely to\r\npreserve the proper longitudinal spacing between the lower ends of the\r\nstruts. A certain lack of rigidity was inherent in the system due to\r\nthat very discontinuity which characterized its action; however, this\r\nwas compensated for by a pair of light diagonal stay rods crossing each\r\npanel. These rods served the additional function of distributing\r\nconcentrated loads to adjacent struts much in the manner of the bridging\r\nbetween floor joists in a building.\r\n\r\nIn the Winchester span the floor system was of timber for reasons of\r\neconomy. This was a very minor weakness inasmuch as any stick could be\r\nquickly replaced, and without disturbing the function of the structure.\r\nBollman received a patent for his truss in January 1852, and in the same\r\nyear published a booklet describing his system in general and the\r\nHarpers Ferry span in particular. Here, he first calls it a \"suspension\r\nand trussed bridge,\" which is indeed an accurate designation for a\r\nsystem which is not strictly a truss because it has no active lower\r\nchord. (The analogy to a suspension bridge is quite clear, each pair of\r\nprimary rods being comparable to a suspension cable.) Thereafter,\r\nBollman's invention was generally termed a suspension truss.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE TRUSS\r\n\r\nBollman's 1852 publication was widely disseminated here and abroad and\r\nstudied with respectful interest by the engineering profession. Its\r\ndrawings of the structure were copied in a number of leading technical\r\njournals in England and Germany. Although there is no record that the\r\ntype was ever reproduced in Europe, there can be little doubt that this\r\nsuccessful structural use of iron by the most eminent railroad in the\r\nUnited States and its endorsement by an engineer of Latrobe's status\r\ngave great impetus to the general adoption of the material. This\r\ninfluence was certainly equal to that of Stephenson's tubular iron\r\nbridge of 1850 over the Menai Strait, or Roebling's iron-wire suspension\r\nbridge of 1855 over Niagara gorge. The Bollman design had perhaps even\r\ngreater influence, as the B. & O. immediately launched the system with\r\ngreat energy and in great numbers to replace its timber spans; on the\r\nother hand, Roebling's structure was never duplicated in railroad\r\nservice, and Stephenson's only once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--_Left:_ CONJECTURAL SECTION of Bollman's\r\nsegmental wrought-iron column, about 1860, and section of the standard\r\nPhoenix column; _right:_ Phoenix column as used in truss-bridge\r\ncompression members.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVALUATION OF THE TRUSS\r\n\r\nBy the late 1850's iron was well established as a bridge material\r\nthroughout the world. Once the previous fears of iron had been stilled\r\nand the attention of engineers was directed to the interpretation of\r\nexisting and new spanning methods into metal, the Bollman truss began to\r\nsuffer somewhat from the comparison. Although its components were simple\r\nto fabricate and its analysis and design were straightforward, it was\r\nless economical of material than the more conventional panel trusses\r\nsuch as the Pratt and Whipple types. Additionally, there was the\r\nrequisite amount of secondary metal in lower chords and braces necessary\r\nfor stability and rigidity.\r\n\r\nA factor difficult to assess is Bollman's handling of his patent, which\r\nwas renewed in 1866. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that he\r\nconsidered the patent valuable because it was based upon a sound design.\r\nTherefore, he probably established a high license fee which, with the\r\ntruss's other shortcomings, was sufficient to discourage its use by\r\nother railroads. As patron, the B. & O. had naturally had full rights to\r\nits use.\r\n\r\nAn additional defect, acknowledged even by Bollman, arose because of the\r\nunequal length of the links in each group except the center one. This\r\ncaused an unevenness in the thermal expansion and contraction of the\r\nframework, with the result that the bridges were difficult to keep in\r\nadjustment. This had the practical effect of virtually limiting the\r\nsystem to intermediate span lengths, up to about 150 feet. For longer\r\nspans the B. & O. employed the truss of another of Latrobe's assistants,\r\nGerman-born and technically trained Albert Fink.\r\n\r\nThe Fink truss was evolved contemporaneously with Bollman's and was\r\nstructurally quite similar, being a suspension truss with no lower\r\nchord. The principal difference was the symmetry of Fink's plan, which\r\nwas achieved by carrying the individual panel loads from the panel\r\npoints to increasingly longer panel units before having them appear at\r\nthe end bearings. This eliminated the weakness of unequal strains. The\r\ndesign was basically a more rational one, and it came to be widely used\r\nin spans of up to 250 feet, generally as a deck-type truss (see fig.\r\n11).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. Bollman and Company\r\n\r\n\r\nBollman resigned from the Baltimore and Ohio in 1858 to form, with John\r\nH. Tegmeyer and John Clark, two of his former B. & O. assistants, a\r\nbridge-building firm in Baltimore known as W. Bollman and Company. This\r\nwas apparently the first organization in the United States to design,\r\nfabricate, and erect iron bridges and structures, pioneering in what 25\r\nyears later had become an immense industry. The firm had its foundation\r\nat least as early as 1855 when advertisements to supply designs and\r\nestimates for Bollman bridges appeared over Tegmeyer's name in several\r\nrailroad journals (see fig. 12).\r\n\r\nBollman's separation from the B. & O. was not a complete one. The\r\nrailroad continued its program of replacing timber bridges with Bollman\r\ntrusses, and contracted with W. Bollman and Company for design and a\r\ncertain amount of fabrication. There is some likelihood that eventually\r\nfabrication was entirely discontinued at Mount Clair, and all parts\r\nsubsequently purchased from Bollman.\r\n\r\nThe firm prospered, erecting a number of major railroad bridges in\r\nMexico, Cuba, and Chile. Operations ceased from 1861 to 1863 because of\r\ndifficult wartime conditions in the border city of Baltimore. Following\r\nthis, Bollman reentered business as sole proprietor of the Patapsco\r\nBridge and Iron Works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUINCY BAY BRIDGE\r\n\r\nFigure 17.--CHICAGO, BURLINGTON AND QUINCY RAILROAD BRIDGE over Quincy\r\nBay (branch of the Mississippi River) at Quincy, Illinois. The pivot\r\ndraw-span was formed of two Bollman deck trusses supported at their\r\nouter ends by hog chains. The bridge was built in 1867-1868 by the\r\nDetroit Bridge and Iron Co., Bollman licensee. (Clarke, _Account of the\r\nIron Railway Bridge ... at Quincy, Illinois_.)]\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy of Bollman's works in this period was a series of\r\nspans at Harpers Ferry. The B. & O.'s timber bridge had been destroyed\r\nby Confederate forces in June 1861, and the crossing was thereafter made\r\nupon temporary trestlework. This was a constant source of trouble, with\r\ncontinuing interruptions of the connection from high water, washouts,\r\nand military actions. The annoyance and expense of this became so great\r\nthat the company decided to risk an iron bridge at the crossing. In July\r\nand August 1862, two sections of Bollman truss, spans no. 4 and no. 5\r\nwere completed. As this occurred during the time when W. Bollman and\r\nCompany was inoperative, the work was produced at Mount Clair to\r\nBollman's design and, undoubtedly, erected under his supervision. Five\r\nweeks later, on September 24, these and Bollman's famous Winchester span\r\nof 1851 were blown up by the Confederates, and the line's business was\r\nagain placed at the mercy of trestling.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the B. & O. administration indeed seems to have been\r\nunshakable when, in the face of such heartbreaking setbacks, it\r\ndetermined to again bridge the river with iron, even at the height of\r\nthe hostilities. In November, span no. 5 was erected, and by April 1863\r\nnos. 3, 4, and 6 also. These were the four straight spans in midriver\r\nbetween the \"wide\" (or \"branch,\" or \"wye\") span and the span on the\r\nMaryland shore over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (see fig. 13).\r\nAlthough the wood floor system of these spans was burned for strategic\r\nreasons by U.S. troops later in 1863, they survived the war.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the remaining trestlework was replaced with Bollman trusses.\r\nThis magnificent structure served the railroad until 1894 when the\r\nright-of-way was realigned at Harpers Ferry. However, the half used by\r\nthe common road remained in use until carried away by the disastrous\r\nflood in 1936. The piers may still be seen.\r\n\r\nDuring the prewar years, Bollman evolved a structural development of\r\nmost profound importance, which is usually associated with the Phoenix\r\nIron Works and its founder, Samuel J. Reeves. In the erection of a high\r\ntrestlework viaduct for the Havana Railroad, Bollman apparently became\r\nconcerned with the tensile weakness of cast iron when applied in long,\r\nunsupported columns. Although a column is normally subjected to\r\ncompressive stresses, when the slenderness ratio--that is, the length\r\ndivided by the radius of gyration of the cross section--becomes great, a\r\nsecondary bending stress may be produced. If this stress becomes great\r\nenough, the value of the tensile stress in one side of the column may\r\nactually exceed the principal compressive stress, and a net effect of\r\ntension result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--OHIO RIVER CROSSING of the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nat Benwood, West Virginia, completed in 1870. Bollman deck trusses were\r\nused in the approaches on both sides. (Photo 693, Baltimore and Ohio\r\nCollection, Museum of History and Technology.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--PATAPSCO RIVER crossing of the Baltimore and\r\nOhio between Thistle and Ilchester, Maryland.

The normal practice at\r\nthe time was to use cast compression members in iron bridges and\r\nstructures, with their sectional area so proportioned to the length that\r\na state of tension could not exist. In the case of long members, this\r\nnaturally meant that an excessive amount of material was used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--TWO VIEWS OF BOLLMAN-BUILT \"water-pipe truss\"\r\nthat carries Lombard Street over Jones Falls in Baltimore. Built in\r\n1877.]\r\n\r\nBollman was conscious of the problem from his experience with the\r\nstretchers and struts of his truss, and he must have been aware of the\r\ngreat advantage which would be obtained by a practical method of forming\r\nsuch members in wrought iron, the tensile resistance of which is\r\nequivalent to the compressive. He eventually developed the forerunner of\r\nwhat came to be known as the Phoenix form by having special segmental\r\nwrought-iron shapes rolled by Morris, Tasker and Company of\r\nPhiladelphia, these shapes being combined into a circular section with\r\noutstanding flanges for riveting together. The circular section is\r\ntheoretically the most efficient to bear compressive loading. A column\r\nof any required diameter could be produced by simply increasing the\r\nnumber of segments, the individual size of which never exceeded\r\ncontemporary rolling mill capacity (see fig. 16).\r\n\r\nThe design exhibits the inspired combination of functional perfection\r\nand simplicity that seems to characterize most great inventions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--THE HARPERS FERRY BRIDGE toward the end of\r\nits career, carrying a common road over the Potomac.

(_Photo\r\ncourtesy of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park._)]\r\n\r\nIt may have been because he had no facilities for rolling that Bollman\r\ncommunicated his idea to Reeves, although this seems illogical. At any\r\nrate, Reeves and his associates patented the system extensively, and the\r\nPhoenix column was eventually employed to the virtual exclusion of\r\ncast-iron and other types of wrought-iron columns. By the end of the\r\n19th century it began to pass from use, as mills became capable of\r\nproducing larger sections with properties relatively favorable to column\r\nuse and more adaptable to connection with other members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Use of the Bollman Truss\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bollman truss found occasional use elsewhere than on the B. & O.\r\nlines, but generally only when erected on contract by Patapsco Bridge\r\nand Iron Works. However, the fact that Bollman could profitably erect\r\nthis bridge in the severely competitive 1870's indicates that the harsh\r\ncriticism of the system by authorities of such stature as Whipple was\r\nnot necessarily justified. Bollman's advertisements, in fact, refer to\r\nthe favorable recommendations of other such renowned engineers as\r\nHerman Haupt and M. C. Meigs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--BOLLMAN DECK TRUSSES in the North River\r\nBridge built in 1873 at Mount Crawford, Virginia, on the Valley Railroad\r\nof Virginia (B. & O.). Each end span is 98 ft. 6 in.; the river span is\r\n148 ft. 9 in. (Photo 756, Baltimore and Ohio Collection, Museum of\r\nHistory and Technology.)]\r\n\r\nAn interesting application of the system was in a drawbridge, formed of\r\ntwo Bollman deck spans, over an arm of the Mississippi at Quincy,\r\nIllinois (see fig. 17). The first iron bridge in Mexico was erected by\r\nBollman over the Medellín River about 1864. Another work of this period,\r\nwhich attracted considerable attention, was a pair of bridges that\r\nBollman erected over North Carolina's Cape Fear River in 1867-1868.\r\nThese bridges were notable for their foundation on cast-iron cylinders,\r\nsunk pneumatically. This was one of the first instances of the use of\r\nthe process in America, and the depth of 80 feet below the water surface\r\nreached by one cylinder was considered remarkable for years afterward.\r\n\r\nIn the last active decade or so of his career, Bollman produced hundreds\r\nof minor bridges and other structures. In 1873 he supplied the castings\r\nfor the splendid iron dome of Baltimore's City Hall and erected the\r\ningenious water-main truss which carries Lombard Street over Jones Falls\r\nin that city. In this structure the top and bottom chords of the central\r\nline of trussing are cast-iron water mains, bifurcated at the abutments,\r\nand joined by cast- and wrought-iron web members (see fig. 20).\r\n\r\nIn the mid 1870's Bollman saw his truss pass into obsolescence. This was\r\ndue primarily to the generally increasing distrust of cast iron for\r\nmajor structural members due to its brittleness, but advances in\r\nstructural theory, availability of a greater variety of rolled\r\nstructural shapes, and the increasing loading patterns of the period all\r\ncontributed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--THE ONLY SURVIVING BOLLMAN TRUSS BRIDGE, at\r\nSavage, Maryland. The bridge was built elsewhere in 1852 and was moved\r\nto this now-abandoned Baltimore and Ohio industrial siding in about\r\n1888.]\r\n\r\nAlthough no Bollman trusses were built by Bollman or the B. & O. after\r\n1875, those in use were only removed as required by heavier motive\r\npower. The Harpers Ferry span, as noted, remained in full main-line\r\nservice until 1894. Bollman trusses on feeder lines were continued in\r\nuse until much later; a number of them on the Valley Railroad of\r\nVirginia (see fig. 22) were not removed until 1923. However, only on the\r\nmost isolated spurs was the Bollman truss permitted to reach really ripe\r\nage. The sole known remaining example (fig. 23) stands on such a\r\nbranch--ironically, at Savage, over the Little Patuxent, the site of the\r\nfirst Bollman span. This is not the 1850 bridge, but one built in 1852\r\nand moved to the present site 30 years later. The fate of the first span\r\nis not known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--HOT-WATER AND CHOCOLATE PITCHERS of the\r\n10-piece, silver tea service presented to Bollman by his fellow\r\nemployees when he resigned from the Baltimore and Ohio in 1858.

Battison is associate curator of mechanical\r\n    and civil engineering in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of\r\n    History and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectness and simplicity characterize pioneer machine tools because\r\nthey were intended to accomplish some quite specialized task and the\r\nneed for versatility was not apparent. History does not reveal the\r\nearliest forms of any primitive machines nor does it reveal much about\r\nthe various early stages in evolution toward more complex types. At best\r\nwe have discovered and dated certain developments as existing in\r\nparticular areas. Whether these forms were new at the time they were\r\nfirst found or how widely dispersed such forms may have been is unknown.\r\nSurviving evidence is in the form of pictures or drawings, such as the\r\nlittle-known screw-cutting lathe of 1483 (fig. 1) shown in _Das\r\nmittelalterliche Hausbuch_.\r\n\r\nThis lathe shows that its builder had a keen perception of the necessary\r\nelements, reduced to bare essentials, required to accomplish the object.\r\nPresent are the coordinate slides often credited to Henry Maudslay. His\r\nslides are not, of course, associated with the spindle; neither is there\r\nany natural law which compels them to guide the tool exactly parallel\r\nwith the axis of revolution. In this sense the screw-cutting lathe in\r\nthe _Hausbuch_ is superior because it is in harmony with natural law and\r\ncan generate a true cylinder, whereas Maudslay's lathe can only transfer\r\nto the work whatever accuracy is built into it.\r\n\r\nIn principle this machine shown in the _Hausbuch_ is very advanced as we\r\nsee when we follow the design through to the present time. The artist,\r\nwhose drawings give us our only knowledge of the machine, himself was\r\nobviously not very familiar with the details of its function. Reference\r\nto figure 1 shows that the threads on the lead screw and on the work,\r\nwind in opposite directions. This must be an error in delineation since\r\nthe two are closely coupled together without any intervening mechanism\r\nso that the only possible result on the work must be a thread winding in\r\nthe same direction as on the original screw. The work also is shown\r\nthreaded for its entire length; this cannot be accomplished with any one\r\nlocation of the cross-slide. We are left with the question of whether\r\nthis slide was used in two locations or whether the artist, possibly\r\nworking from notes or an earlier rough sketch, failed to show an\r\nunthreaded portion on one end or the other of the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--EARLIEST REPRESENTATION FOUND OF A\r\nMASTER-SCREW TYPE of thread-cutting machine. From the inconsistencies,\r\nsuch as right- and left-hand threads on master and work, it appears that\r\nthe artist had scant insight into actual function. From plate 62 of _Das\r\nmittelalterliche Hausbuch, nach dem Originale im Besitze des Fürsten von\r\nWaldburg-Wolfegg-Waldsee, im Auftrage des Deutschen Vereins für\r\nKunstwissenschaft, herausgegeben von Helmuth Th. Bossert und Willy F.\r\nStorck_ (Leipzig: E. A. Seemann, 1912).]\r\n\r\nOf at least equal importance with the lead screw and work and their\r\nrelationship to each other is the tool-support with its screw-adjusted\r\ncross-slide (fig. 2). Just how this was attached to the frame of the\r\nmachine so that it placed the tool at a suitable radius is again a\r\nquestionable point. The very well-developed cutting tool is sharpened to\r\na thin, keen edge totally unsuited for cutting metal but ideal for use\r\non a softer, fibrous substance: undoubtedly wood, in this instance.\r\nUnfortunately, the angle at which the artist chose to show us this\r\ncutter is not a view from which it is possible to judge whether or not\r\nthe tool has been made to conform to the helix angle of the thread to be\r\ncut. This cross-slide, in conjunction with the traversing work spindle,\r\ngives us a machine having two coordinate slides yielding the same effect\r\nas the slide rest usually attributed to Henry Maudslay at the end of the\r\n18th century. Actually, an illustration of coordinate slides independent\r\nof the spindle had been published as early as 1569 by Besson[1] and\r\nknowledge of them widely disseminated by his popular work on mechanics.\r\nThese slides are shown as part of a screw-cutting machine with a\r\nquestionably adequate connection, by means of cords, between the master\r\nscrew and the work.\r\n\r\nIt was the author's pleasure recently to obtain for the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution and identify a small, nicely made, brass instrument which\r\nhad been in two collections in this country and one collection in\r\nGermany as an unidentified locksmith's tool (fig. 3). This proved to be\r\nan instrument of the traverse-spindle variety for threading metal.\r\nFortunately, all essential details were present including a cutter (A in\r\nfigure 4); this instrument was identified by the signature \"Manuel\r\nWetschgi, Augspurg.\" The Wetschgis were a well-known family of gunsmiths\r\nand mechanics in Augsburg through several generations. Two bore the\r\ngiven name Emanuel: the earlier was born in 1678 and died in 1728. He\r\nwas quite celebrated in his field of rifle making and became chief of\r\nartillery to the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel shortly before his death in\r\nhis 51st year. Little is known of the later Emanuel Wetschgi except that\r\nhe was at Augsburg in 1740. Tentative attribution of the instrument has\r\nbeen made to the earlier Emanuel, chiefly on the basis of his recognized\r\nposition as an outstanding craftsman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--CROSS-SLIDE for the thread-cutting lathe of\r\n_Das mittelalterliche Hausbuch_, shown in figure 1. It is remarkable not\r\nonly for its early date, but also for its high state of development with\r\na crossfeed screw which had not become universally accepted 300 years\r\nlater. The cutter, shown out of its socket, is obviously sharpened for\r\nuse on wood.]\r\n\r\nIn several respects this little machine differs from its predecessor of\r\nthe _Hausbuch_, as might be expected when allowance is made for the\r\ngenerations of craftsmen who undoubtedly worked with such tools over the\r\nroughly 200 years of time separating them. Another factor to consider\r\nwhen comparing these two machines is that one was used on metal, the\r\nother probably only on wood. Therefore, it is not surprising to find on\r\nthe later machine an outboard or \"tailstock\" support for the work. The\r\nspindle of this support has to travel in unison with the work-driving\r\nspindle so that it is not an unexpected discovery to find that it is\r\nspring-loaded. Figure 5 shows how this spring may be adjusted to\r\naccommodate various lengths of work by moving the attachment screw to\r\nvarious holes in both the spring and in the frame. Also visible in the\r\nsame illustration is a rectangular projection at the other end of the\r\nspring which engages a mating hole in the \"tailstock\" spindle to prevent\r\nits rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--SMALL THREAD-CUTTING LATHE which was made to\r\nbe held in a vise during use. It was found as shown here, with only the\r\noperating crank missing. The overall length is approximately 12 inches,\r\ndepending on the adjustment of parts. (Smithsonian photo 46525B.)]\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows the traversing spindle and nut removed from the machine.\r\nProvision has been made for doing this so easily that there is every\r\nreason to believe that, originally, there were various different spindle\r\nand nut units which could be interchangeably used in the machine.\r\nAdditional evidence tending to support this concept exists in the\r\ncutting tool (fig. 4), which must have been intended for serious work as\r\nit has been carefully fitted in its unsymmetrical socket. The cutting\r\nblade of this tool, which works with a scraping rather than a true\r\ncutting action, is too wide to form a properly proportioned thread when\r\nused with the existing lead screw. This may well indicate that the tool\r\nwas made for use with a lead of coarser pitch, now lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--THE WORKING AREA of figure 3, showing the tool\r\nand signature. (Smithsonian photo 46525A.)]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most startling feature of this machine when compared with\r\nthe machine of the _Hausbuch_, is the absence of a cross-slide for\r\nadjusting the tool. Possibly this can be explained by the blunt scraping\r\nedge on the tool. In actual use, recently, to cut a sample screw, using\r\na tool similar to the one found in the machine (fig. 7), it was found\r\nadvantageous to be free of a cross-slide and thus be able to feed the\r\ntool into the work by feel rather than by rule, as would be done with a\r\nslide rest. In this way, it was possible to thread steel without\r\ntearing, as the cutting pressure could readily be felt and the tool\r\ncould release itself from too heavy a cut. Size on several screws could\r\nbe repeated by setting the tool to produce the desired diameter when its\r\nsupporting arm came to rest against the frame of the machine. The screws\r\nused in the machine itself were apparently made in just such a way. They\r\nwere not cut with a die as the thread blends very gradually into the\r\nbody of the screw without the characteristic marks left by the cutting\r\nedges of a die. Threads cut with a single-point tool controlled by a\r\ncross-slide usually end even more abruptly than those cut by a die,\r\nwhile it would be quite simple with a machine of the nature we are\r\nconsidering to bring the thread to a gentle tapering end as seen in\r\nfigure 8 (another view of the screw A in fig. 3) by gradually releasing\r\nthe pressure necessary to keep the tool cutting as the end of the\r\nthread was approached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--SPRING FOR KEEPING THE FOLLOWER SPINDLE\r\nagainst the work, showing the method and range of adjustment. Note the\r\nrectangular projection to engage a mating socket in the spindle, to\r\nprevent spindle rotation. (Smithsonian photo 46525.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--WORK SPINDLE AND ITS NUT removed from the\r\nmachine to illustrate how easily another spindle and nut of different\r\npitch could be substituted. (Smithsonian photo 46525C.)]\r\n\r\nThat machines of this general type having the lead screw on the axis of\r\nthe work were competitive with other methods and other types of machines\r\nover a long period of time may be seen from figures 9 and 10. The\r\nmachine, left front in figure 9 and in more intimate detail in figure\r\n10, can be seen to differ little from that shown in _Das\r\nmittelalterliche Hausbuch_ of 1483. The double work-support is, of\r\ncourse, a great improvement, while the tool-support is regressive since\r\nit lacks a feed screw.\r\n\r\nThe development of engineering theory, coupled with the rising needs of\r\nindustry, particularly with the advent of the Industrial Revolution,\r\nbrought about accelerated development of screw-cutting lathes through\r\nthe combination of screw-cutting machines with simple lathes as seen in\r\nfigure 9 and in detail in figure 11. One important advance shown here\r\nis driving the machine by means of a cord or band so that any means of\r\nrotary power could be applied, not just hand or foot power. Of greater\r\ninterest and technical importance to this study is the provision, seen\r\nto better advantage in figure 11, for readily changing from one master\r\nlead screw to another. This had already been achieved in the Manuel\r\nWetschgi machine, as far as versatility is concerned, although not in\r\nquite such a convenient way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--THREAD OF MODERN FORM recently cut, using the\r\nold screw and nut but with a new tool. The material threaded is\r\ncarbon-steel drill rod. (Smithsonian photo 49276A.)]\r\n\r\nFigure 12, the headstock of another and more advanced lathe than shown\r\nin figures 9 and 11 but of the same type, shows \"keys\" (D), each of\r\nwhich is a partial nut of different pitch to engage with a thread of\r\nmating pitch. The dotted lines in figure 13 show the engaged and\r\ndisengaged positions of one of these keys, and figure 14 shows the\r\nspindle with the various leads, C. At D is a grooved collar to be\r\nengaged by the narrow key shown in operating position at the left in\r\nfigure 12 for the purpose of controlling the endwise movement of the\r\nspindle when used for ordinary turning instead of thread-cutting. In\r\nreturn for greater convenience and freedom from the expense of the many\r\nseparate spindles, as typified by the Wetschgi machine, a sacrifice has\r\nbeen made in the length of the thread which can be cut without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--BINDING SCREW seen at A in figure 3, showing\r\nthe long smooth fadeout of the thread below the shoulder. (Smithsonian\r\nphoto 49276.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--MAKING SCREWS IN FRANCE in the third quarter\r\nof the 18th century. From _L'Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des\r\nsciences, des arts et des métiers ... receuil de planches sur les\r\nsciences, les arts libéraux, et les arts méchaniques, avec leur\r\nexplication_ (Paris: 1762-1772), vol. 9, plate 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--DETAILS OF THE MACHINE in the left foreground\r\nof figure 9, showing the crude tool-support without screw adjustment.\r\nFrom _L'Encyclopédie_, vol. 9, plate 2.]\r\n\r\nThis reduction in the length that could conveniently be threaded was no\r\ngreat drawback on many classes of work. This can be realized from figure\r\n16 which shows a traverse-spindle lathe headstock typical of the\r\nmid-19th century. During the years intervening between the machines of\r\nfigures 12 and 16, the general design was greatly improved by removing\r\nthe lead screws from the center of the spindle. This made possible a\r\nshorter, much stiffer spindle and supported both ends of the spindle in\r\none frame or headstock rather than in separate pieces attached to the\r\nbed. The screws were now mounted outside of the spindle-bearings, one at\r\na time, while the mating nuts were cut partially into the circumference\r\nof a disk which could be turned to bring any particular nut into working\r\nposition as required. With this arrangement, a wide variety of leads\r\neither right or left hand could be provided and additional leads could\r\nbe fitted at any future time. Screw-cutting lathes of this design were\r\npopular for a very long time with instrument makers and opticians who\r\nhad little need to cut screws of great length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--DETAILS OF THE THREADING LATHE seen in the\r\nright foreground of figure 9 showing the method of drive and support for\r\nthe work. From _L'Encyclopédie_, vol. 9, plate 1.]\r\n\r\nThe demands of expanding industry for greater versatility in the\r\nproduction of engineering elements late in the 18th century set the\r\nstage for the evolution of more complex machines tending to place the\r\nthreaded spindle lathes in eclipse. Maudslay's lathe of 1797-1800 (fig.\r\n15) appeared at this time when industry was receptive to rapid\r\ninnovation. Unfortunately, the gearing which once existed to connect the\r\nheadstock spindle with the lead screw has long been lost. At this time\r\nit is quite difficult to say with certainty whether the original gear\r\nset offered a variety of ratios, as was true of slightly later Maudslay\r\nlathes, or a fixed ratio. The plausibility of the fixed ratio theory is\r\nsupported by the very convenient means, seen in figure 15, for removing\r\nthe lead screw in preparation for substitution of one of another pitch.\r\nAll that is required is to back off its supporting center at the\r\ntailstock end and withdraw the screw from its split nut[2] and from the\r\ndriving clutch near the headstock. This split nut also would have to be\r\nchanged to one of a pitch corresponding to that of the screw. While more\r\nexpensive than a solid nut, it neatly circumvents the need (and saves\r\nthe time involved) to reverse the screw in order to get the tool back to\r\nthe point of beginning preliminary to taking another cut. David\r\nWilkinson's lathe of 1798 (fig. 17) which was developed in Rhode Island\r\nat the same time shows the same method of mounting and driving the\r\nmaster screw. At least in the United States, this method of changing the\r\nlead screw instead of using change gears remained popular for many\r\nyears. Examples of this changeable screw feature are to be found in the\r\nlathes constructed for the pump factory of W. & B. Douglas Company,\r\nMiddletown, Connecticut,[3] in the 1830's. Middletown, at that time one\r\nof the leading metal-working centers in one of the chief industrial\r\nStates, had been for many years the site of the Simeon North arms\r\nfactory which rivaled Whitney's. In this atmosphere, it is reasonable to\r\nexpect that machinery constructed by local mechanics, as was the custom\r\nin those days, would reflect the most accepted refinements in machine\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--WELL-DEVELOPED EXAMPLE of lathe headstock\r\nhaving several leads on the spindle and provision for mounting the work\r\nor a work-holding chuck on the spindle.

Note the\r\nscale of feet. From _L'Encyclopédie_, vol. 10, plate 16.]\r\n\r\nRoughly twenty years later, Joseph Nason of New York patented[4] the\r\ncommercially very important \"Fox\" brassworker's lathe (fig. 18). While\r\nthis does have a ratio in the pair of gears connecting the work spindle\r\nand master screw, it is clear from the patent that various pitches are\r\nto be obtained by changing screws, not by changing gears. The patent\r\nsums it up as follows:\r\n\r\n     A nut upon the end of the stud ... is unscrewed when the guide\r\n     screw is to be removed or changed. The two wheels ... should have\r\n     in their number of teeth a common multiple. They are seldom or\r\n     never removed and their diameters are made dissimilar only for the\r\n     purpose of giving to the guide screw a slower rate of motion than\r\n     that of the mandrel whereby it may be made of coarser pitch than\r\n     that of the screw to be cut and its wear materially lessened.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of gearing between the spindle and the lead screw, for\r\nwhatever purpose, could not help but introduce variable factors caused\r\nby inaccuracies in the gears themselves and in their mounting. These\r\nwere of little consequence for common work, particularly when coupled to\r\na screw which, itself, was of questionable accuracy. The increasing\r\nrefinements demanded in scientific instruments and in machine tools\r\nthemselves after they had reached a relatively stable form dictated that\r\nattention be dedicated to improved accuracy of the threaded components.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--MAUDSLAY'S WELL-KNOWN screw-cutting lathe of\r\n1797-1800, showing the method of mounting and driving changeable master\r\nscrews.

(U.S. National Archives photo.)]\r\n\r\nAn attack on this problem, which interestingly reverts to the\r\nfundamental principle of motion derived from a master screw without the\r\nintervention of other mechanism (fig. 19), is covered by a patent[5]\r\nissued to Charles Vander Woerd, one-time superintendent of the Waltham\r\nWatch Company. The problem is well stated in the patent:\r\n\r\n     This invention relates to the manufacture of leading screws to be\r\n     used for purposes requiring the highest attainable degree of\r\n     correctness in the cutting of the screw-threads of said screw ...\r\n     as, for example, in machines for ruling lines in glass plates to\r\n     produce refraction [sic] gratings for the resolution of the lines\r\n     of the solar spectrum, such machines being required to rule many\r\n     thousands of lines on an inch of space by a marking device which is\r\n     reciprocated over the glass plate and is fed by the action of a\r\n     leading screw after the formation of each line. Great difficulty\r\n     has been experienced in constructing a leading screw for this and\r\n     other purposes, in which the thread is so nearly correct as to\r\n     produce no perceptible variation in the microscopic spaces between\r\n     the ruled lines or gratings.... Various causes prevent the\r\n     formation of a thread on the rod or blank, which is absolutely\r\n     uniform and accurate from end to end of the rod. Among other causes\r\n     are the variations of temperature from time to time, the\r\n     imperfections of the operating leading screw, the springing of the\r\n     leading screw and of the rod that is being threaded, and other\r\n     unavoidable causes, all of which, although apparently trivial and\r\n     producing only slight variations in the thread at different parts\r\n     of the rod or blank, are of sufficient moment to be seriously\r\n     considered when a screw of absolute accuracy is desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--NASON'S LATHE, patented in 1854, showing a\r\nmaster lead screw driven at less than work speed so that the master\r\ncould be of a coarser and more durable pitch than the work. U.S. patent\r\n10383.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in figure 19 that Vander Woerd's machine, to\r\navoid the problems outlined in his patent, has returned to a starkly\r\nsimple design. We are not told, however, how he originated this master\r\nscrew which is used to produce the accurately threaded work pieces.\r\nLater generations, in the search for ever-greater accuracy, also\r\nreturned to the fundamental simplicity of a master screw as we shall see\r\nwhen we consider the refinements in mechanism necessary to the extended\r\ndevelopment of the automobile and the airplane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--VANDER WOERD'S PATENT, seen here, covered the\r\ncombination of a master screw, toolslide and work in a rigid frame to be\r\nsupported and driven by outside means of no required precision. U.S.\r\npatent 293930 dated February 1884.]\r\n\r\nAs the power and speed of automobiles and aircraft increased, critical\r\nparts became more highly stressed. Gears and threaded parts were\r\nparticularly troublesome details of the mechanism because of the\r\nstresses concentrated in them, and, in the case of gears, because of the\r\ninternal and external stresses originating in minute deviations from the\r\nideal of tooth form and spacing. The problems were not entirely new but\r\nhad hitherto been solved by increasing the size of the parts, an avenue\r\nof limited utility to designers in these fields where total weight as\r\nwell as the effects of mass and inertia are so important. By making\r\nthese parts of heat-treated steel, the strength could be made suitable\r\nwhile the size and mass of the parts were kept within bounds. The\r\nnecessary processes of heat-treating were not always applicable to\r\nfinished parts as they sometimes destroyed both finish and accuracy.\r\nGrinding, which was well developed for the simple plane, cylindrical,\r\nand conical surfaces so widely used in mechanisms, had to be extended to\r\nthreads and gears so that they could be finished after heat-treating.\r\nSometimes the gear teeth themselves were ground; for other applications\r\nit was sufficient to improve the accuracy of the gear cutters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--A HOB-GRINDING MACHINE patented in 1932 and\r\nincorporating the master-screw principle. Carl G. Olson's U.S. patent\r\n1874592.]\r\n\r\nAttempts to produce gear hobs free of the imperfections and distortions\r\nintroduced by heat treatment led to another return to the use of the\r\nmaster lead screw. Figure 20 illustrates a machine having this feature\r\nwhich was patented in 1932 by Carl G. Olson.[6] In speaking of the\r\nspindle-driving mechanism disclosed in earlier patents, the patent goes\r\non to say:\r\n\r\n     This driving mechanism includes an integral spindle 20, one\r\n     extremity thereof being designed for supporting a hob 22 and the\r\n     other extremity thereof being formed so as to present a lead screw\r\n     24. The spindle 20 is mounted between a bearing 26 and a bearing\r\n     28, the latter bearing providing a nut in which the lead screw 24\r\n     rotates.... From the description thus far given it will be apparent\r\n     that the rotation of the lead screw 24 within the bearing or nut 28\r\n     will cause the hob to be moved axially, the lead of the screw 24\r\n     being equal to the lead of the thread in the hob.\r\n\r\nClaim 8 which concludes the descriptive portion of the patent states in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     In a hob grinding machine of the class described, a rotary work\r\n     supporting spindle, means for effecting longitudinal movement of\r\n     the spindle, a tool holder for supporting a grinding wheel in\r\n     operative position with respect to the work supported by the\r\n     spindle during the rotary and longitudinal movement thereof, ...\r\n\r\nEven before this patent was applied for, another patent was pending for\r\nthe purpose of modifying the pitch of the lead screw without the use of\r\nchange gears in spite of the wide acceptance of such gear mechanisms for\r\nover a hundred years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--A HOB-GRINDING MACHINE OF 1933, showing use\r\nof the master screw with a modifier but without change gears. Carl G.\r\nOlson's U.S. patent 1901926.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--A SINE-BAR DEVICE to modify the effective\r\nlead of a master lead screw without introducing a complex mechanism\r\nwhich would be both difficult to make and to operate within the required\r\nclose limits. Carl G. Olson's (1933) U.S. patent 1901926.]\r\n\r\nFigure 21 shows a plan view[7] of the machine, and figure 22 a detailed\r\nview of the sine-bar mechanism actuated by the master screw, 6, to\r\nmodify the effective pitch of the lead screw in accordance with the\r\nrealities of practice as stated in the preamble of the patent:\r\n\r\n     This invention relates to material working machines, and\r\n     particularly to machines such as hob grinders and the like, wherein\r\n     the work is reciprocated through the agency of a lead screw.\r\n\r\n     In the manufacture of hobs it is common practice to employ the same\r\n     machine for grinding hobs of varied diameters, and in order to\r\n     employ such a machine in this manner the pitch of the lead screw,\r\n     thereof, which actuates the work carrier, must conform to the axial\r\n     pitch of the hob to be ground. This will be readily apparent when\r\n     it is understood that the helix angles of hobs vary in accordance\r\n     with their diameters and, consequently, the difference between the\r\n     normal pitch and the axial pitch correspondingly varies. While the\r\n     requirement for the normal pitch may be the same for hobs of\r\n     different diameters, it is necessary to change the axial pitch in\r\n     accordance with a change in the hob diameter, and this axial pitch\r\n     of the hob is equal to the pitch of the lead screw which actuates\r\n     the work carrier in grinding machines heretofore used. Hence, in\r\n     order to adapt such machines to cover a wide range of leads, it is\r\n     necessary to provide a large number of interchangeable lead screws\r\n     and obviously this represents a large investment, and the\r\n     interchanging of these screws requires the expenditure of\r\n     considerable time in setting up the machine for each job.\r\n\r\nThread-grinding machines were being designed concurrent with the\r\ndevelopment of hob-grinding machines. Many were entirely concerned with\r\nfeatures peculiar to the problems of wheel-dressing and to automatic\r\ncharacteristics. An invention to embody the use of a master screw and\r\nconcerned with the precision grinding of worm threads, for use in\r\ngearing, was patented by Frederick A. Ward in this era.[8] That part of\r\nthe invention pertaining to the use of a master screw, \"a rotary work\r\nholder mounted on said carriage and provided with a driving spindle, an\r\nexchangeable master screw and stationary nut detachably secured to said\r\nspindle and head,...\" is shown in figure 23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--DETAILS OF A WORK SPINDLE WITH WORK, showing\r\nthe use of a master lead screw to control the pitch of a precision worm\r\nthread being ground. From the 1933 U.S. patent 1899654, of F. A. Ward's\r\nworm-grinding machine.]\r\n\r\nMachines embodying the principle of the master lead screw are found in\r\nconstant use by industry at the present time for specialized\r\napplication. Whenever technological changes again reopen the topic of\r\nthread-cutting to a new degree of accuracy or call for a reevaluation of\r\npopular methods for any other reason, we may expect to see another\r\nresurgence of the master-screw method, for no other design eliminates so\r\nmany variables or rests on such firm and fundamental natural principles\r\nas the machine of _Das mittelalterliche Hausbuch_ of 1483, the earliest\r\nsuch machine now known.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n   [1]  JACQUES BESSON, _Des instruments mathématiques, et méchaniques,\r\n        servants à l'intelligence de plusiers choses difficiles, &\r\n        necessaires à toutes républiques_, 1st ed.

This article details the merits of their\r\n    claims to priority._\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR: _Robert A. Chipman is chairman of the Department of\r\n    Electrical Engineering at the University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio,\r\n    and consultant to the Smithsonian Institution._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrostatic Instruments before 1800\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the fundamental premise of instrument-science that a device for\r\ndetecting or measuring a physical quantity can be based on any\r\nphenomenon associated with that physical quantity. Although the\r\ninstrumentation of electrostatics in the 18th century, for example,\r\nrelied mainly on the phenomena of attraction and repulsion and the\r\nubiquitous sparks and other luminosities of frictional electricity, even\r\nthe physiological sensation of electric shock was exploited\r\nsemiquantitatively by Henry Cavendish in his well-known anticipation of\r\nOhm's researches. Likewise, Volta in 1800[1] described at length how the\r\napplication of his pile to suitably placed electrodes on the eyelids, on\r\nthe tongue, or in the ear, caused stimulation of the senses of sight,\r\ntaste and hearing; on the other hand, he reported that electrodes in the\r\nnose merely produced a \"more or less painful\" pricking feeling, with no\r\nimpression of smell. The discharges from the Leyden jars of some of the\r\nbigger frictional machines, such as van Marum's at Leyden, were found by\r\n1785 to magnetize pieces of iron and to melt long pieces of metal\r\nwire.[2]\r\n\r\nThe useful instruments that emerged from all of this experience were\r\nvarious deflecting \"electrometers\" and \"electroscopes\" (the words were\r\nnot carefully distinguished in use), including the important goldleaf\r\nelectroscope ascribed to Abraham Bennet in 1787.[3]\r\n\r\nIn 1786, Galvani first observed the twitching of the legs of a dissected\r\nfrog produced by discharges of a nearby electrostatic machine, thereby\r\nrevealing still another \"effect\" of electricity. He then discovered that\r\ncertain arrangements of metals in contact with the frog nerves produced\r\nthe same twitching, implying something electrical in the frog-metal\r\nsituation as a whole. Although Galvani and his nephew Aldini drew from\r\nthese experiments erroneous conclusions involving \"animal electricity,\"\r\nwhich were disputed by Volta in his metal-contact theory, it is\r\nsignificant from the instrumentation point of view that the frog's legs\r\nwere unquestionably by far the most sensitive detector of metal-contact\r\nelectrical effects available at the time. Without their intervention the\r\ndevelopment of this entire subject-area, including the creation of\r\nchemical cells, might have been delayed many years. Volta himself\r\nrealized that the crucial test between his theory and that of Galvani\r\nrequired confirming the existence of metal-contact electricity by some\r\nelectrical but nonphysiological detector. He performed this test\r\nsuccessfully with an electroscope, using the \"condensing\" technique he\r\nhad invented more than a decade earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstrumenting Voltaic or Galvanic Electricity, 1800-1820\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his famous letter of March 20, 1800, written in French from Como,\r\nItaly, to the president of the Royal Society in London, Volta made the\r\nfirst public announcement of both his \"pile\" (the first English\r\ntranslator used the word \"column\"), and his \"crown of cups\" (the same\r\ntranslator used \"chain of cups\" for Volta's \"couronne de tasses\"). The\r\nformer consisted of a vertical pile of circular disks, in which the\r\nsequence copper-zinc-pasteboard, was repeated 10 or 20 or even as many\r\nas 60 times, the pasteboard being moistened with salt water. The \"crown\r\nof cups\" could be most conveniently made with drinking glasses, said\r\nVolta, with separated inch-square plates of copper and zinc in salt\r\nwater in each glass, the copper sheet in one glass being joined by some\r\nintermediate conductor and soldered joints to the zinc in the next\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nVolta considered the \"crown of cups\" and the \"pile\" to be essentially\r\nidentical, and as evidences of the electrical nature of the latter,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    ... if it contains about 20 of these stories or couples of metal, it\r\n    will be capable not only of emitting signs of electricity by\r\n    Cavallo's electrometer, assisted by a condenser, beyond 10° or 15°,\r\n    and of charging this condenser by mere contact so as to make it emit\r\n    a spark, etc., but of giving to the fingers with which its\r\n    extremities (the bottom and top of the column) have been touched\r\n    several small shocks, more or less frequent, according as the\r\n    touching has been repeated. Each of these shocks has a perfect\r\n    resemblance to that slight shock experienced from a Leyden flask\r\n    weakly charged, or a battery still more weakly charged, or a torpedo\r\n    in an exceedingly languishing state, which imitates still better the\r\n    effects of my apparatus by the series of repeated shocks which it\r\n    can continually communicate.[4]\r\n\r\nThe \"effects\" provided by Volta's pile and crown-of-cups are therefore\r\nelectroscope deflection, sparks, and shocks. Later in the letter, he\r\ndescribes the stimulation of sight, taste, and hearing as noted earlier,\r\nbut nowhere does he mention chemical phenomena of any kind, or the\r\nheating of a wire joining the terminals of either device. Hence, except\r\nfor the additional physiological responses, he adds nothing to the\r\ncatalog of observations on which instruments might be based. His\r\nfamiliarity with the moods of the torpedo (electric eel) seems to be\r\nintimate.\r\n\r\nThe reading of Volta's letter to the Royal Society on June 26, 1800, its\r\npublication in the Society's _Philosophical Transactions_ (in French)\r\nimmediately thereafter, and its publication in English in the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_ for September 1800,[5] gave scientists\r\nthroughout Europe an easily constructed and continuously operating\r\nelectric generator with which innumerable new physical, chemical, and\r\nphysiological experiments could be made. Editor-engineer William\r\nNicholson read Volta's letter before its publication and, by the end of\r\nApril, he and surgeon Anthony Carlisle had built a voltaic pile.\r\nApplying a drop of water to improve the \"connection\" of a wire lying on\r\na metal plate, they happened to notice gas bubbles forming on the wire,\r\nand pursued the observation to the point of identifying the electrical\r\ndecomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen.\r\n\r\nWithin two or three years innumerable electrochemical reactions had been\r\ndescribed, some of which, one might think, could have served as\r\noperating principles for electrical instruments. Although the phenomena\r\nof gas formation and metal deposition were in fact widely used as crude\r\nindicators of the polarity and relative strength of voltaic piles and\r\nchemical cells during the period 1800-1820 (and the gas bubbles were\r\nmade the basis of a telegraph receiver by S. T. Soemmering), the\r\nquantitative laws of electrolysis were not worked out by Faraday until\r\nafter 1830, and not until 1834 was he satisfied that the electrolytic\r\ndecomposition of water was sufficiently well understood to be made the\r\nbasis for a useful measuring instrument. Describing his\r\nwater-electrolysis device in that year, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    The instrument offers the only _actual measurer_ [italics his] of\r\n    voltaic electricity which we at present possess. For without being\r\n    at all affected by variations in time or intensity, or alterations\r\n    in the current itself, of any kind, or from any cause, or even of\r\n    intermissions of actions, it takes note with accuracy of the\r\n    quantity of electricity which has passed through it, and reveals\r\n    that quantity by inspection; I have therefore named it a\r\n    VOLTAELECTROMETER.[6]\r\n\r\nIn passing, Faraday commented that the efforts by Gay-Lussac and Thenard\r\nto use chemical decomposition as a \"measure of the electricity of the\r\nvoltaic pile\" in 1811 had been premature because the \"principles and\r\nprecautions\" involved were not then known. He also noted that the\r\ndetails of _metal deposition_ in electrolysis were still not\r\nsufficiently understood to permit its use in an instrument.[7]\r\n\r\nThe heating of the wires in electric circuits must have been observed so\r\nearly and so often with both electrostatic and voltaic apparatus, that\r\nno one has bothered to claim or trace priorities for this \"effect.\" The\r\nproduction of incandescence, however, and the even more dramatic\r\ncombustion or \"explosion\" of metal-foil strips and fine wires has a good\r\ndeal of recorded history. Among the first to burn leaf metal with a\r\nvoltaic pile was J. B. Tromsdorff of Erfurt who noted in 1801 the\r\ndistinctly different colors of the flames produced by the various common\r\nmetals. In the succeeding few years, Humphry Davy at the Royal\r\nInstitution frequently, in his public lectures, showed wires glowing\r\nfrom electric current.\r\n\r\nEarly electrical instrumentation based on the heating effect took an\r\nunusual form. Shortly after 1800, W. H. Wollaston, an English M.D.,\r\nlearned a method for producing malleable platinum. He kept the process\r\nsecret, and for several years enjoyed an extremely profitable monopoly\r\nin the sale of platinum crucibles, wire, and other objects. About 1810,\r\nhe invented a technique for producing platinum wire as fine as a few\r\nmillionths of an inch in diameter, that has since been known as\r\n\"Wollaston wire.\" For several years preceding 1820, no other instrument\r\ncould compare the \"strengths\" of two voltaic cells better than the test\r\nof the respective maximum lengths of this wire that they could heat to\r\nfusion. One can sympathize with Cumming's comment in 1821 about \"the\r\ndifficulty in soldering wires that are barely visible.\"[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrical Instrumentation, 1800-1820\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 20 years following the announcement of the voltaic-pile invention\r\nwere years of intense experimental activity with this device. Many new\r\nchemical elements were discovered, beginnings were made on the\r\nelectrochemical series of the elements, the electric arc and\r\nincandescent platinum wires suggested the possibilities of electric\r\nlighting, and various electrochemical observations gave promise of other\r\npractical applications such as metal-refining, electroplating, and\r\nquantity production of certain gases. Investigators were keenly aware\r\nthat all of the available means for measuring and comparing the\r\n_electrical_ aspects of their experiments (however vaguely these\r\n\"electrical aspects\" may have been conceived), were slow, awkward,\r\nimprecise, and unreliable.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was such that prominent scientists everywhere were ready\r\nto pounce immediately on any reported discovery of a new electrical\r\n\"effect,\" to explore its potentialities for instrumental purposes. Into\r\nthis receptive environment came H. C. Oersted's announcement of the\r\nmagnetic effects of a voltaic circuit, on July 21, 1820.[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--\"GALVANOMETER\" WAS THE NAME given by Bischof\r\nto this goldleaf electrostatic instrument in 1802, 18 years before\r\nAmpère coupled the word with the use of Oersted's electromagnetic\r\nexperiment as an indicating device.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOersted's Discovery\r\n\r\n\r\nMany writers have expressed surprise that with all the use made of\r\nvoltaic cells after 1800, including the enormous cells that produced\r\nthe electric arc and vaporized wires, no one for 20 years happened to\r\nsee a deflection of any of the inevitable nearby compass needles, which\r\nwere a basic component of the scientific apparatus kept by any\r\nexperimenter at this time. Yet so it happened. The surprise is still\r\ngreater when one realizes that many of the contemporary natural\r\nphilosophers were firmly persuaded, even in the absence of positive\r\nevidence, that there _must_ be a connection between electricity and\r\nmagnetism. Oersted himself held this latter opinion, and had been\r\nseeking electromagnetic relationships more or less deliberately for\r\nseveral years before he made his decisive observations.\r\n\r\nHis familiarity with the subject was such that he fully appreciated the\r\nimmense importance of his discovery. This accounts for his employing a\r\nrather uncommon method of publication. Instead of submitting a letter to\r\na scientific society or a report to the editor of a journal, he had\r\nprivately printed a four-page pamphlet describing his results. This, he\r\nforwarded simultaneously to the learned societies and outstanding\r\nscientists all over Europe. Written in Latin, the paper was published in\r\nvarious journals in English, French, German, Italian and Danish during\r\nthe next few weeks.[10]\r\n\r\nIn summary, he reported that a compass needle experienced deviations\r\nwhen placed near a wire connecting the terminals of a voltaic battery.\r\nHe described fully how the direction and magnitude of the needle\r\ndeflections varied with the relative position of the wire, and the\r\npolarity of the battery, and stated \"From the preceding facts, we may\r\nlikewise collect that this conflict performs circles....\" Oersted's\r\ncomment that the voltaic apparatus used should \"be strong enough to heat\r\na metallic wire red hot\" does not excuse the 20-year delay of the\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginnings of Electromagnetic Instrumentation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mere locating of a compass needle above or below a suitably oriented\r\nportion of a voltaic circuit created an electrical instrument, the\r\nmoment Oersted's \"effect\" became known, and it was to this basic\r\njuxtaposition that Ampère quickly gave the name of galvanometer.[11] It\r\ncannot be said that the scientists of the day agreed that this\r\ninstrument detected or measured \"electric current,\" however. Volta\r\nhimself had referred to the \"current\" in his original circuits, and\r\nAmpère used the word freely and confidently in his electrodynamic\r\nresearches of 1820-1822, but Oersted did not use it first and many of\r\nthe German physicists who followed up his work avoided it for several\r\nyears. As late as 1832, Faraday could make only the rather noncommittal\r\nstatement: \"By current I mean anything progressive, whether it be a\r\nfluid of electricity or vibrations or generally progressive forces.\"[12]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whatever the words or concepts they used, experimenters\r\nagreed that Oersted's apparatus provided a method of monitoring the\r\n\"strength\" of a voltaic circuit and a means of comparing, for example,\r\none voltaic battery or circuit with another.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly clear, from Oersted's pamphlet, that if a compass\r\nneedle was deflected clockwise when the wire of a particular voltaic\r\ncircuit lay above it in the magnetic meridian, the same needle would\r\n_also_ be deflected clockwise if the wire was turned end-for-end and\r\nplaced _below_ the compass needle, without changing the rest of the\r\ncircuit. Anyone perceiving this fact might deduce, as a matter of logic,\r\nthat if the wire of the circuit was first passed above the needle, in\r\nthe magnetic meridian, then folded and returned in a parallel path below\r\nthe needle, the deflecting effect on the needle would be repeated, and a\r\nmore sensitive indicator would result, assuming that any additional wire\r\nintroduced has not affected the \"circuit\" excessively.\r\n\r\nSince 1821, historical accounts of the origins of electromagnetism seem\r\nto have limited their credit assignments for the conception and\r\nobservation of this electromagnetic \"doubling\" effect (or \"multiplying\"\r\neffect, if the folding is repeated) to three persons. Almost without\r\nexception, however, these accounts have given no specific information as\r\nto precisely what each of these three accomplished, what physical form\r\ntheir respective creations took, what experiments they performed, and\r\nwhat functional understanding they apparently had of the situation. The\r\nusual statement is simply that a compass needle was placed in a coil of\r\nwire.[13] The main purpose of the present review is to recount some of\r\nthese details.\r\n\r\nThe following are the three candidates whose names are variously\r\nassociated with the \"invention\" of the first constructed electromagnetic\r\ninstrument, or \"multiplier,\" or primitive galvanometer.\r\n\r\nJOHANN SALOMO CHRISTOPH SCHWEIGGER (1779-1857) in 1820 had already been\r\neditor for several years of the _Journal für Chemie und Physik_, and was\r\nprofessor of chemistry at the University of Halle.\r\n\r\nJOHANN CHRISTIAN POGGENDORF (1796-1877) in 1820 had only recently\r\nentered the University of Berlin as a student following several years as\r\nan apothecary's apprentice and a brief period as an apothecary. Four\r\nyears later, he succeeded Gilbert as editor of the influential _Annalen\r\nder Physik_, a position he held for more than 50 years.\r\n\r\nJAMES CUMMING (1771-1861) in 1820 was professor of chemistry at\r\nCambridge University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChronology and Priority\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest established date in the \"multiplier\" record is September\r\n16, 1820, when Schweigger read his first paper to the Natural Philosophy\r\nSociety of Halle. There seems to be no reason to doubt that this report\r\njustifies the frequently used label \"Schweigger's multiplier.\"\r\n\r\nIn an exuberant support of Schweigger's position, Speter[14] with no\r\nmention of Cumming and no hint of \"invention\" details, shows that\r\nPoggendorf in 1821 admitted Schweigger's priority, but suffered some\r\nlapse of memory 40 years later when writing sections of his biographical\r\ndictionary, leaving a distinct suggestion that the invention was his.\r\nFurther confusion for later generations resulted from some ambiguous\r\nentries in the _Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie_ of 1888. The name\r\n\"multiplier\" seems not to have originated with Schweigger himself.\r\nSpeter credits it to Meineke as \"working\" editor of Schweigger's\r\n_Journal_, but Seebeck seems to have used it much earlier.[15]\r\n\r\nConceding priority of conception to Schweigger (Cumming has not been a\r\nreal competitor on this point) does not alter the fact that all three\r\nseem to have reached their results independently of one another, that\r\nthe first work of each on this subject was published within a period of\r\nfive months, that there were significant differences in their\r\nconceptions of the uses and the optimum design of their devices and that\r\nbetween them they provided an adequate foundation for the subsequent\r\ndevelopment of the galvanometer to become the primary\r\nelectrical-measuring instrument.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of publication, Schweigger, as editor of what was\r\npopularly called Schweigger's _Journal_, had an obvious advantage, and\r\npresented his experiments beginnings on page 1 of the first volume of\r\nhis _Journal_ for 1821, published January 1 of that year.[16] Oersted's\r\npaper had appeared two volumes previously. He began by referring to\r\nOersted's discovery as \"the most interesting to be presented in a\r\nthousand years of the history of magnetism.\" He was, in fact, so\r\nimpressed with the epochal nature of Oersted's achievement that he\r\ncommemorated it by giving his _Journal_ a second title so that \"volume\r\none\" of the new title could begin in the year after Oersted's\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nPoggendorf, as a relatively junior student, had no such easy access to\r\npublicity, but he had a staunch admirer in one of his professors, Paul\r\nErman at the University of Berlin. Erman added a seven-page postscript\r\non Poggendorf's invention to his book _Outline of the Physical Aspects\r\nof the Electro-chemical Magnetism Discovered by Professor Oersted_,\r\npublished before April 1821,[17] with an introductory paragraph:\r\n\r\n    Herr Poggendorf, who is one of the most excellent ornaments of the\r\n    lecture room and laboratory of the University here, carried out a\r\n    very coherent and well-conceived investigation of electro-chemical\r\n    magnetism, leading step-by-step to a method of amplifying this\r\n    activity-phenomenon by means of itself.\r\n\r\nThe postscript begins by referring to the \"condenser [_Kondensator_]\r\njust brought to my attention by Herr Poggendorf\" and explains that he\r\ncannot release his treatise \"without preliminary announcement of this\r\nsubject of the highest importance.\" (It can be inferred from the text\r\nthat the name \"condenser\" was chosen because of the device's enhancing\r\nof magnetic measurements analogously to the enhancing of electric\r\nmeasurements by Volta's electrostatic \"condenser.\")\r\n\r\nImmediately on reading the book, Schweigger published extracts, mainly\r\nof the postscript, with indignant comments on Erman's remissness (or\r\nworse) in having failed to mention Schweigger's prior work.[18]\r\n\r\nHowever, Erman was not alone in his unawareness, if it was that, of\r\nSchweigger's discovery.\r\n\r\nRival editor Gilbert of the _Annalen der Physik_ reviewed Erman at much\r\ngreater length than Schweigger, reprinting most of the postscript with\r\nevident enthusiasm, and stating in his preamble that the invention is\r\nattributed to \"a young physicist studying here in Berlin, Herr\r\nPoggendorf.\"[19] Only in a footnote is the reader directed to another\r\nfootnote in the next article in the volume, where Gilbert finally states\r\nthat he \"cannot leave unmentioned the fact that this amplifying\r\napparatus seems to be due to Herr Professor Schweigger.\" He then quotes\r\nrather fully from Schweigger's first two papers.[16] Oersted in 1823\r\nexplained the situation thus: \"The work of M. Poggendorf, having been\r\nmentioned in a book on electromagnetism by the celebrated M. Erman\r\npublished very shortly after its discovery, became known to many\r\nscientists before that of M. Schweigger. This is the reason for the same\r\napparatus carrying different names.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThe same confusion is well illustrated by the paper to which Gilbert\r\nattached his confessional footnote mentioned above. Written by Professor\r\nRaschig of Dresden, on April 3, 1821, the paper is entitled \"Experiments\r\nwith the Electro-magnetic Multiplier,\" but the device, throughout the\r\npaper, is repeatedly referred to in the phrase \"Poggendorf's condenser,\r\nor rather multiplier,\" an awkward combination that suggests editorial\r\nintervention.[21]\r\n\r\nThe work of James Cumming at Cambridge is described in two papers which\r\nhe read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1821, which were then\r\nduly published in the _Transactions_ of that Society. The first, \"On the\r\nConnexion of Galvanism and Magnetism,\" was read April 2, 1821,[22] and\r\nthe second, \"On the Application of Magnetism as a Measure of\r\nElectricity,\" was read a few weeks later on May 21st.[23]\r\n\r\nThough he quotes some unrelated 18th-century experiments by Ritter in\r\nGermany, an 1807 publication of Oersted's, and electromagnetic\r\nexperiments with solenoids performed by Arago and Ampère in late 1820,\r\nCumming makes no mention of Schweigger or Poggendorf, and never uses the\r\nword \"multiplier.\" It, therefore, seems probable that his work was done\r\nwithout knowledge of the German publications or inventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Electromagnetic Multipliers\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three sets of instruments made, respectively, by Schweigger,\r\nPoggendorf and Cumming, those of Schweigger are the most elementary, and\r\nthe least realistic from a practical point of view. He makes little\r\neffort to investigate the effect of any design parameters, but presents\r\nsome odd conductor configurations that involve unimportant variations of\r\nthe basic principle. The following extracts from his first three\r\npapers[13] contain the major references to his conception, construction,\r\nand use of his multiplier.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER READ IN HALLE, SEPTEMBER 16, 1820\r\n\r\n    That a powerful voltaic pile is required for these experiments (of\r\n    Oersted) I have confirmed in my physics lectures, using an electric\r\n    pile that was so strong it would easily produce potassium metal the\r\n    second and third day after it was built. However, I soon saw that\r\n    the electromagnetic effect was related, not to the pile, but to the\r\n    simple circuit, and I was thereby led to perform the experiment with\r\n    much greater sensitivity. To amplify these electromagnetic phenomena\r\n    of the simple circuit it seemed to me necessary to adopt a different\r\n    arrangement from that initiated by Volta, in order that the\r\n    electrical phenomena of his simple circuit might be raised to a\r\n    higher degree.\r\n\r\n    Since a reversal of the effect occurs according to whether the\r\n    connecting-wire lies over or under the needle, and likewise\r\n    according to whether the wire leads from the positive or negative\r\n    pole, thence I say it is an easy inference that a doubling of the\r\n    effect is attainable, which is verified in practice.\r\n\r\n    I present to the Society the simple \"doubling apparatus\"\r\n    [_Verdoppelungs-Apparat_], where the compass is placed between two\r\n    wires passing around it. A multiplication of the effect is easily\r\n    obtained when the wire is not just once but many times wound around.\r\n    A single turn suffices, however, to demonstrate Oersted's\r\n    experiments, using small strips of zinc and copper dipped in\r\n    ammonium-chloride solution.\r\n\r\nAmid innumerable, rambling theorizations (such as, that \"hydrogenation\r\naffects magnetism as oxidation affects galvanism,\" or \"sulphur,\r\nphosphorous and carbon are especially significant in magnetism, since\r\niron in combination with any of these inflammable materials becomes a\r\nmagnet-material\"), Schweigger announces that he looked for the reactive\r\nforce of the needle on the connecting wire in the simple Oersted\r\nexperiment, and that he used his \"amplifying apparatus\" to look for\r\nmagnetic effects from an electrostatic machine, but without success in\r\nboth cases. He suggests that he will continue with many more\r\nelectromagnetic experiments because \"with the use of the\r\ndoubling-apparatus, the needle, instead of needing for excitation a cell\r\ncapable of generating sparks, approaches more closely the sensitivity of\r\na twitching nerve.\" However, \"additional special experiments are\r\nrequired to find to what limits the amplification can be increased by\r\nthe method I have created in the construction of this\r\ndoubling-apparatus, using multiple turns of wire.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--THIS WIRE \"BOW-PATTERN\" was the first\r\nillustration Schweigger gave of his \"doubling apparatus,\" though he had\r\npresented a verbal description of a single-coil arrangement somewhat\r\nearlier. The purpose of the bow pattern was to show that compass needles\r\nat the centers of the two loops deflected in opposite directions. (From\r\n_Journal für Chemie und Physik_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER READ IN HALLE, NOVEMBER 4, 1820\r\n\r\n[The first half of this paper describes successful observations of the\r\nreaction-force of a magnetic needle on the connecting wire of a voltaic\r\ncircuit, achieved by pivoting the connecting wire in the form of brass\r\nneedles above and below the compass needle. Though the multiplier\r\nconfiguration of needle and wire is in fact present here, Schweigger\r\ndoes not mention it, evidently regarding this as a separate project. He\r\ncontinues.]\r\n\r\n    In my lecture of September 16th, I showed that Oersted's results\r\n    depend, not on the voltaic cell, but only on the connecting circuit.\r\n    The principle I have used for amplification of the effects, for the\r\n    construction of an electromagnetic battery as it were, was the\r\n    winding of wire around the compass, and I now present to the Society\r\n    a bow-pattern of multiple-wound, wax-insulated wire, Figure 3.\r\n    [There were no illustrations with Schweigger's first paper.] While\r\n    a single wire, using the weak electric circuit here, deflects the\r\n    magnetic needle only 30° or 40°, if the compass is placed in one of\r\n    the openings of this pattern, the needle is deflected 90° to the\r\n    east, or in the other opening 90° to the west, using the same weak\r\n    electric circuit....\r\n\r\nThe \"bow-pattern\" device has novelty interest only, adding nothing to\r\nthe elucidation of the multiplier phenomenon. The same is true of\r\nSchweigger's next proposal, shown in figure 4. \"... I will now add\r\nanother apparatus, which is just an extension of the previous one,\r\nwhereby the needle can take up any angle from 0° to 180°.\" A short\r\nlength of circular glass tubing, of inside diameter large enough to\r\ncontain a compass needle, stands with its axis vertical and has single\r\nor multiple loops of wire wound on it in vertical diametral planes. In\r\nthe illustration, successive plane coils are inclined at 30° to one\r\nanother. \"... the electric current flows through the whole wire, and the\r\nneedle moves under all of these currents, and coming always into another\r\nloop can take any desired angle.\"\r\n\r\nWith much further theorizing about \"the correlation of magnetism with\r\nthe cohesion of bodies,\" Schweigger states again his evaluation of his\r\ndiscovery: \"Oersted succeeded in electromagnetic research by using a\r\nspark-producing cell, which could make a wire glow. My amplifying\r\nelectromagnetic device needs only a weak circuit of copper, zinc, and\r\nammonium chloride solution.\"[24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--SCHWEIGGER MADE THIS peculiar construction of\r\nwire coils, wound endwise on a short vertical section of glass tubing\r\nwith a compass needle inside, merely to startle his Halle audience with\r\nthe fact that the compass needle could rest in any of several stable\r\npositions. (From _Journal für Chemie und Physik_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--SCHWEIGGER'S SUGGESTION of one possible design\r\nfor an amplifying electromagnetic indicator. The components are wooden\r\nrods and insulated wire. Position b referred to in the text is at the\r\nbottom of the diagram between the letters a and c. (From _Journal für\r\nChemie und Physik_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FURTHER WORDS ABOUT THE NEW MAGNETIC PHENOMENA\"\r\n\r\n[This was presumably written between November 4, 1820, and the January\r\n1, 1821, publication date of his _Journal_.]\r\n\r\n    These wonderful new electrical effects[25] are most easily rendered\r\n    perceptible with the help of the previously described wire loops. To\r\n    focus attention on just one of the windings of Figure 3, we sketch a\r\n    new drawing, Figure 5.... Since it is of major importance that these\r\n    loops be made of silk-covered wire lying evenly on one another, it\r\n    is convenient to wind the loops on two small slotted sticks of wood,\r\n    although it is also possible to hold the wires together with wax or\r\n    shellac, or to tie them together in an orderly manner with silk\r\n    thread....\r\n\r\n    In Figure 5, Aa and Cc represent little slotted rods of wood on\r\n    which the silk-covered wire is wound. Only three windings are shown\r\n    in the figure, but I generally adopt three times that many. Now t is\r\n    connected with the copper and d with the zinc, and the compass B set\r\n    between the rods Aa and Cc with the coil perpendicular to the\r\n    magnetic meridian and the terminals d, t at the east.\r\n\r\n    The instant Z and K are dipped in the ammonium chloride solution,\r\n    the needle turns around and stays with the north pole point\r\n    south....\r\n\r\n    If now the compass is taken out of the coil and put in position b,\r\n    all effects are reversed, and are considerably weaker, for obvious\r\n    reasons....\r\n\r\n    It is of the same significance whether we bring the compass from B\r\n    to b in Figure 5, or from mesh 1 to mesh 2 in Figure 3, only that in\r\n    the latter case, because the compass is enclosed by the two sides, a\r\n    stronger effect results....\r\n\r\n    If now the coil is rotated ... so that the face previously north now\r\n    faces south, then on connecting the electric circuit there is\r\n    absolutely no trace of effect on the needle, assuming that the\r\n    terminal wires are not reversed....\r\n\r\n    It seems unnecessary to note that our magnetic coil can be placed in\r\n    the direction of the magnetic meridian or at any arbitrary angle\r\n    with it....\r\n\r\nFollowing several pages of further talk about the relation of \"cohesion\r\nto magnetism\" and about \"unipolar and bipolar conductors,\" the only\r\nadditional item of interest is the observation that discharges of a\r\nLeyden jar (_Kleistichen Flasche_) strong enough to burn strips of leaf\r\ngold and to magnetize an iron rod in a coil, produced no compass-needle\r\ndeflections, even with the help of the \"amplifying apparatus.\"\r\n\r\nSchweigger, therefore, described the basic multiplier idea clearly\r\nenough in his first paper, but offered no sketch of the simplest\r\nconstruction until the third paper. In the second paper, meanwhile, he\r\nhad illustrated two peculiar designs involving the principle in less\r\nelementary ways.\r\n\r\nHis indifference to whether the wire loops lie _in_ the magnetic\r\nmeridian (fig. 3) or perpendicular to it (fig. 5) or \"at any other\r\narbitrary angle to it,\" reveals a poor appreciation of the\r\nmeasuring-instrument potentialities. His conception seems to be\r\nprimarily that of a detector.\r\n\r\nPoggendorf's invention, as first reported by Erman and presented to a\r\nwider audience by Gilbert[26] was described as consisting of typically\r\n40 to 50 turns of 1/10-line diameter, silk-covered copper wire tied\r\ntightly together, with the whole pressed laterally to form an elliptical\r\nopening in which a pivoted compass needle could move freely while\r\nmaintaining clearance of about 2 lines from the wire at all points.[27]\r\n\r\n\"This magnetic condenser can be a great boon to electro-chemistry,\" said\r\nErman, for \"it avoids all the difficulties of electric condensers.\" He\r\nnoted that, using the condenser, Poggendorf had already established the\r\nelectric series for a great number of bodies, discovered various\r\nanomalies about conductivities, and found a way of detecting dissymmetry\r\nof the poles of a compass needle. On the other hand, even with the\r\ncondenser, no magnetic effects have so far been obtainable from a strong\r\ntourmaline, or from a 12,000-pair, Zamboni dry cell.\r\n\r\nPoggendorf's own account of his work finally appeared as a very long\r\narticle in the journal known as \"Oken's Isis.\"[28] The editorial\r\ncontroversies mentioned earlier may have occasioned this use of a\r\nperiodical of such minor status in the fields of physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe source of Poggendorf's vision of the multiplier principle was a\r\nlittle different from Schweigger's inspiration. Aiming at some detailed\r\nanalysis of Oersted's observation, Poggendorf ran the connecting wire of\r\nhis cell-circuit along a vertical line to just above or below the\r\npivot-point of the compass needle, then, after a right-angle bend,\r\nhorizontally above or below one of the poles of the needle. As he\r\nstudied the deflections produced for all four possible positions of such\r\na wire, with both cell polarities, he came to realize that if a\r\nrectangular wire loop in a vertical plane enclosed a compass needle, all\r\nparts of the horizontal sides of the loop would produce additive\r\ndeflections. By a separate experiment, he showed that the vertical sides\r\nof the loop would also increase the deflections. He saw at the same time\r\nthat the effect of additional turns would be cumulative.\r\n\r\n    The multiple surrounding of the needle by a silk-covered wire, in a\r\n    plane perpendicular to the long axis of the needle, affords the\r\n    physicist a very simple and sensitive means of detecting the\r\n    slightest trace of galvanism, or of magnetism produced by it, so\r\n    that I have given the name of magnetic condenser to this\r\n    construction, though I attach no special value to this name ...\r\n\r\n    In analyzing the astonishingly increased power which the condenser\r\n    gives to the magnetic effect of a circuit, the first question that\r\n    arises is how the effect varies with the number of turns, whether it\r\n    increases indefinitely or reaches a maximum beyond which additional\r\n    turns have no effect. The answer to this first question is linked to\r\n    the solution of another, viz, whether the degrees deflection are a\r\n    direct expression of the measure of the magnetic force or not.\r\n\r\n    To instruct myself on this point I made use of three separate\r\n    circuits, each containing an 8-turn condenser, and put these as\r\n    close together as possible in the magnetic meridian ... with the\r\n    needle between the windings. Each single circuit ... gave a\r\n    deflection of 45° ... When two were connected the deflection was\r\n    60°, and when finally all three were put in magnetic operation, the\r\n    deflection grew to only 70°. It appears clearly from this that the\r\n    angle of deflection is not in a simple ratio with the magnetic force\r\n    acting on the needle....\r\n\r\nNeither Poggendorf nor Schweigger seems to have ruled out, on logical\r\ngrounds alone, the possibility of deflections greater than 90°, with the\r\nloop-plane in the magnetic meridian, though Poggendorf does add a vague\r\nnote that if the needle deflected too far it would encounter forces of\r\nthe opposing sign.\r\n\r\nPoggendorf experimented with the size of the circuit wires, finding that\r\nlarger wires led to greater deflections. He noted that the size of the\r\ncell plates and the nature of the cell's moist conductors would\r\ncertainly have a great effect, but that to investigate these in detail\r\nwould take undue time, and he therefore proposed to keep this part of\r\nthe apparatus constant, using one pair of zinc and copper plates 3.6\r\ninches in diameter, separated by cloth soaked in ammonium-chloride\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nPoggendorf's principal quantitative study of his magnetic condenser used\r\n13 identical coils, each with 100 turns. In order that the turns should\r\nall be at approximately the same distance from the needle, the coils\r\nwere wound of the finest brass wire that could be silk-insulated, the\r\nwire diameter being 0.02 lines. On adding coils one at a time across the\r\ncell (i.e., connecting them in parallel), the deflections were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Turns              100     200     300      400     500     600    700\r\n  Deflection in\r\n    degrees           45      50      55    59-60      62      63     64\r\n\r\n  Turns              800     900    1000     1100    1200    1300\r\n  Deflection in\r\n    degrees           65    65-1/2    66       66      66      66\r\n\r\nAdding some coils with fewer turns, and connecting various combinations\r\n\"as a _continuum_\" (i.e., in series), the deflections using the same\r\ncell were:\r\n\r\n  Turns             1      5     10     25      50     75    100    200\r\n  Deflection in\r\n    degrees        10     22     27     30   35-40     40     40     40\r\n\r\n  Turns           300    400    500    600     700    800    900   1000\r\n  Deflection in\r\n    degrees        40     40     41     40      40     40     40     40\r\n\r\nMaking a few coils from wire with 1/8-line diameter, the deflections,\r\nagain using the same cell were:\r\n\r\n  Turns                      5       25      50    100    Over 100\r\n  Deflection in degrees    20-22    40-45    45     65          65\r\n\r\nSince the needle used in these experiments was almost as long as the\r\ninside clearance of the coils, no simple tangent law can be applied, and\r\nit is not possible to discover an equivalent circuit in modern terms.\r\nHowever, the constancy of the deflections for large numbers of turns in\r\neach case indicates that the cell voltage and resistance were fairly\r\nconstant, and a rough estimate suggests that the cell resistance was\r\ncomparable to the resistance of one of the 100-turn coils of fine wire.\r\nSuch a value means that cell resistance limited the maximum deflections\r\nfor the parallel-connected multipliers, while coil resistance fixed the\r\nlimit in the series case.\r\n\r\nFor all of these reasons, it was impossible that any useful functional\r\nlaw could be obtained from the data.\r\n\r\nPoggendorf concluded only that \"the amplifying power of the condenser\r\ndoes not increase without limit, but has a maximum value dependent on\r\nthe conditions of plate area and wire size.\" He added two other\r\nsignificant comments derived from various observations, that the basic\r\nOersted phenomenon is independent of the earth's magnetism, and that the\r\nphenomenon is localized, i.e., is not affected by distant parts of the\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nOnly a small fraction of Poggendorf's paper is devoted to elucidating\r\nthe properties of the condenser. A similar amount is concerned with\r\nrefuting various proposals, such as those of Berzelius and Erman, about\r\ndistributions of magnetic polarity in a conducting wire to account for\r\nOersted's results. More than half of the paper describes results\r\nobtained by using the condenser to compare conductivities and cell\r\npolarities under conditions where no effect had previously been\r\ndetectable. Notable is the observation of needle deflections in circuits\r\nwhose connecting wires are interrupted by pieces of graphite, manganese\r\ndioxide, various sulphur compounds, etc., materials which had previously\r\nbeen considered as insulators in galvanic circuits. Poggendorf gives\r\nthese the name of \"semi-conductor\" (_halb-Leiter_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--ELECTROMAGNETIC INSTRUMENTS OF JAMES CUMMING,\r\nused at Cambridge in 1821. One is a single-wire \"galvanometer,\"\r\nfollowing Ampère's definition. Cumming called the multiple-turn\r\nconstruction \"galvanoscopes.\" He showed how to increase their\r\nsensitivity by partial cancellation of the earth's magnetism at the\r\nlocation of the compass needle. (From _Transactions of the Cambridge\r\nPhilosophical Society_, vol. 1, 1821.)]\r\n\r\nCumming's first mention of the multiplier phenomenon, in his paper of\r\nApril 2, 1821,[22] is quite casual, and describes only a one-turn\r\nconstruction. He speaks first of single-turn ring of thick, brass wire,\r\nand after noting that the sides of a circuit produce additive effects on\r\na needle, he comments that a flattened rectangular loop produces nearly\r\nquadruple the effect of a single wire. The paper is primarily a review\r\nof Oersted's work, with references to electromagnetic observations\r\nbefore Oersted, and accounts of various related but nonmultiplier\r\nexperiments that Cumming has made. His second paper, of May 21st,\r\ncontains a fine plate (fig. 6) illustrating arrangements used in\r\ninvestigating the subject of the paper's title \"The Application of\r\nMagnetism as a Measure of Electricity.\" (Neither Poggendorf nor any of\r\nhis commentators ever illustrated his \"condenser.\")\r\n\r\nAlthough this plate is never referred to in the paper itself, a nearby\r\n\"Description\" gives a few comments. The two wire patterns shown are\r\nnoted as simply \"forms of spiral for increasing the electromagnetic\r\nintensity.\" The mounted wire loop, with enclosed compass needle and\r\nterminal mercury cups, is clearly identical in principle with the\r\ndevices of Schweigger and Poggendorf, and is called a \"galvanoscope.\"\r\nThe largest structure illustrated does not involve the multiplying\r\neffect. It is called a \"galvanometer,\" consistent with Ampère's\r\ndefinition of that word. To use it, two leads of a voltaic circuit are\r\ninserted into the mercury cups AC and BD, and the board EFGH carrying\r\nthe cups is moved vertically until some \"standard\" deflection is\r\nobtained on the compass needle below. The relative \"strength\" of the\r\ncircuit is then given by the calibrated position of the sliding section.\r\nUncertainties are undoubtedly introduced by the arbitrary positions of\r\nthe connecting wires from the test circuit to the mercury cups, but\r\nCumming drew some interesting conclusions from various measurements he\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nObserving needle deflections for various positions of the wire A-B, with\r\na \"constant\" voltaic circuit, he found that \"the tangent of the\r\ndeviation varies inversely as the distance of the connecting wire from\r\nthe magnetic needle.\" Here is a combination of the deflection law for a\r\nneedle in a transverse horizontal field and the magnetic-force law for a\r\nlong, straight wire. The latter had been determined experimentally by\r\nBiot and Savart, in November 1820, by timing the oscillations of a\r\nsuspended magnet.[29]\r\n\r\nCumming considers his straight-wire calibrated \"galvanometer\" to be a\r\ndevice for \"measuring\" galvanic electricity; on the other hand, his\r\nmultiple-loop \"galvanoscopes\" are for \"discovering\" galvanic\r\nelectricity. With the multiplier instrument, he found galvanic effects\r\n(i.e., needle deflections) using copper and zinc electrodes with several\r\nacids not previously known to create galvanic action. A\r\npotassium-mercury amalgam electrode created a powerful cell with zinc as\r\nthe positive electrode, establishing both the metallic nature of\r\npotassium and the fact that it is the most negative of all metals.\r\n\r\nIn a third paper, presented April 28, 1823,[30] Cumming reports use of\r\nthe galvanoscope in experiments on the thermoelectric phenomena recently\r\ndiscovered by Seebeck. His note that \"for the more minute effects a\r\ncompass was employed in the galvanoscope, having its terrestrial\r\nmagnetism neutralized ...\" seems to be the earliest mention of this\r\nversion of the astatic principle, a technique whose dramatic effects\r\nwere especially valuable in low-resistance thermoelectric circuits,\r\nwhere the extra resistance of additional multiplier turns largely\r\noffsets their magnetic contribution. In detail, \"the needle is\r\nneutralized by placing a powerful magnet North and South on a line with\r\nits center; and another, which is much weaker, East and West at some\r\ndistance above it: by means of the first the needle is placed nearly at\r\nright angles to the meridian, and the adjustment is completed by the\r\nsecond.\"\r\n\r\nOn varying the length of the connecting wire of the circuit, Cumming\r\nfound the deflections of the multiplier needle to be in a nearly\r\nreciprocal relation. He speaks of the \"conducting power of the wire,\"\r\nand seems not far from visualizing Ohm's law, of which no published form\r\nappeared until 1826. Ohm's own experiments were made with very similar\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--\"SCHWEIGGER MULTIPLIER\" used by Oersted in\r\n1823. A thin magnetic needle is held in a light, paper sling at F,\r\nsuspended by a fine, vertical fiber. (From _Annales de Chimie et de\r\nPhysique_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made to show that electrical experimenters prior to\r\nOersted's discovery in 1820 were in desperate need of some electrical\r\ninstrument for galvanic or voltaic circuits that would combine\r\nsensitivity, simplicity, reliability, and quick response. The nearly\r\nsimultaneous creation by Schweigger, Poggendorf and Cumming of an\r\narrangement consisting of a coil of wire and a compass needle provided\r\nthe first primitive version of a device to fill that need.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--COMPLETELY USELESS ARRANGEMENT of vertical\r\ncoil and horizontal, unmagnetized needle, presented in the _Edinburgh\r\nPhilosophical Journal_ of 1821 as \"Poggendorf's Galvano-Magnetic\r\nCondenser.\" Almost every aspect of Poggendorf's instrument has been\r\nincorrectly represented.]\r\n\r\nIt appears that Schweigger is clearly entitled to credit for absolute\r\npriority in the discovery, but the original sources suggest that both\r\nhis understanding of the device and the subsequent researches he\r\nperformed with it were markedly inferior to those of the other\r\nindependent discoverers. In using the generic label, \"Schweigger's\r\nMultiplier,\" there have been historical examples of attributing to\r\nSchweigger considerably more sophistication than is justified. Figure 7\r\nshows an instrument designed by Oersted in 1823,[20] which he says\r\n\"differs in only minor particulars from that of M. Schweigger.\" On\r\ncomparing figure 7 with figures 3, 4, or 5, the remark seems overly\r\ngenerous.\r\n\r\nThe history of the multiplier instruments has had its fair share of\r\nerroneous reports and misleading clues. A fine example is the\r\nillustration of figure 8, taken from what is often quoted as the first\r\nreport in English on Poggendorf's \"Galvano-Magnetic Condenser.\"[31] The\r\nsketch is the editor's interpretation of a verbal description given him\r\nby a visiting Danish chemist who, in turn, had received the information\r\nin a letter from Oersted. It incorporates, faithful to the description,\r\na \"spiral wire ... established vertically,\" with a needle \"in the axis\r\nof the spiral,\" yet by misunderstanding of the axial relations and of\r\nthe ratio of length to diameter for the coil, a completely meaningless\r\narrangement has resulted. The confusion is compounded by the specifying\r\nof an _unmagnetized_ needle.\r\n\r\nSchweigger and Poggendorf, through their editorial positions, were among\r\nthe best known of all European scientists for several decades. On one\r\nbasis or another their reputations are firmly established. Comparison of\r\nthe accounts of the early \"multipliers,\" however, suggests that the\r\nReverend James Cumming, professor of chemistry at the University of\r\nCambridge, was a very perceptive philosopher. This was well understood\r\nby G. T. Bettany who wrote in the _Dictionary of National Biography_\r\nthat Cumming's early papers \"though extremely unpretentious,\" were\r\n\"landmarks in electromagnetism and thermoelectricity,\" and concluded\r\nthat: \"Had he been more ambitious and of less uncertain health, his\r\nclearness and grasp and his great aptitude for research might have\r\ncarried him into the front rank of discoverers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to thank Dr. Robert P.

Until recently, the only available drawing of the\r\nship has been a patent drawing made for Robert Fulton. This does not\r\ncomply with contemporary descriptions of the steamer and the drawing or\r\nplan is out of proportion with the known dimensions. The lack of plans\r\nhas heretofore made it impossible to illustrate the vessel with any\r\ndegree of precision, or to build a scale model.\r\n\r\nThe discovery in 1960 of some of the plans of this historic ship in the\r\nDanish Royal Archives at Copenhagen now makes possible a reasonably\r\naccurate reconstruction of the vessel and also clarifies some of the\r\nincomplete and often confusing descriptions by contemporary writers.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous published accounts of the ship that are available, the\r\nmost complete is David B. Tyler's \"Fulton's Steam Frigate.\"[1] A\r\ncontemporary description of the vessel by the British Minister to\r\nWashington, 1820-23, Stratford Canning, was published by Arthur J.\r\nMay.[2] In _Naval and Mail Steamers of the United States_, by Charles B.\r\nStuart,[3] and _The Steam Navy of the United States_, by Frank M.\r\nBennett,[4] the history of the ship and some descriptive facts are\r\ngiven.

This\r\nwood engraving appears as plate 1 in Charles B. Stuart's _Naval and Mail\r\nSteamers of the United States_, and illustrates the section on Naval\r\nSteamers, from which the account \"The Demologos; or, Fulton the First,\"\r\nis here reproduced (pp. 167-171). Stuart obtained the sketch, assumed to\r\nhave been made for Fulton's patent on the design of the _Steam Battery_,\r\nfrom the files of the U.S. Navy Department.]\r\n\r\nOn December 24, 1813, Robert Fulton invited a group of\r\nfriends--prominent merchants, professional men and naval officers--to\r\nhis home in New York City and there presented a proposal for a project\r\nof great local interest. At that time the War of 1812 was in its second\r\nyear and the economic effect of the British naval blockade was being\r\nfelt severely. The blockade cut off seaborne trade and posed a constant\r\nthreat of attack upon New York and other important ports, particularly\r\nBaltimore. To defend the ports, it had been proposed to build mobile\r\nfloating batteries or heavily built and armed hulks with small sailing\r\nrigs, but the high cost of these and their doubtful value in helping to\r\nbreak the blockade, compared to the value and action of a very heavy,\r\nlarge frigate, or a 74-gun ship, caused authorities to hesitate to\r\nproceed with the construction of any blockships or floating batteries.\r\n\r\nFulton's proposal concerned a floating battery propelled by steam\r\npower. He believed that steam propulsion not only would give it\r\neffective maneuverability with no loss of gunpower, but also would allow\r\na successful attack upon the Royal Navy blockading ships during periods\r\nof protracted calm, when sailing men-of-war were nearly helpless. The\r\nblockaders then could be attacked and picked off, one by one, by the\r\nheavily armed steamboat.\r\n\r\nAmong those present at the meeting was Major General Henry Dearborn, a\r\nleading citizen and soldier who was later to become noted in American\r\npolitical history. The first step taken during this meeting was the\r\nfounding of the Coast and Harbor Defense Company with Dearborn as\r\npresident, Fulton as engineer, and Thomas Morris as secretary. Next, a\r\ncommittee was established to raise funds from Federal, State, and New\r\nYork City governments as well as from individual contributors to build\r\nthe battery. The members of this committee consisted of General\r\nDearborn, Commodore Stephen Decatur, U.S.N.; General Morgan Lewis;\r\nCommodore Jacob Jones; U.S.N.; Noah Brown, shipbuilder; Samuel L.\r\nMitchill; Henry Rutgers; and Thomas Morris.\r\n\r\nThe committee proved cumbersome and was reduced to General Lewis, Issac\r\nBronson, Henry Rutgers, Nathan Sanford, Thomas Morris, Oliver Wolcott,\r\nand John Jacob Astor. Known as the Coast Defense Society and with the\r\nname of _Pyremon_ given the ship in prospectus, they attempted,\r\nunsuccessfully, to raise funds privately.\r\n\r\nThe estimated sums to build a battery 130 feet long, with a 50-foot\r\nbeam, capable of a speed of 5 mph, and carrying 24 long guns (18-pdr.),\r\nwas $110,000. Fulton, still the chief engineer, in an effort to interest\r\nthe Federal Government, built a model of the proposed vessel and\r\nsubmitted it to some prominent naval officers--Commodore Stephen\r\nDecatur, Jacob Jones, James Biddle, Samuel Evans, Oliver Perry, Samuel\r\nWarrington, and Jacob Lewis. All gave their support to the Society in a\r\nwritten statement and this recommendation proved helpful to the project\r\nin Congress and in the Navy Department. In the process of passing a bill\r\nwhich went to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee calling for $250,000\r\nfor the construction of the floating battery, the sum was raised to\r\n$1,500,000 for the construction of \"one or more\" floating batteries and\r\npassed on March 9, 1814.\r\n\r\nTo supervise the start of construction, the Coast Defense Society\r\nappointed a committee consisting of Dearborn, Wolcott, Morris, Mitchill,\r\nand Rutgers, with Fulton as engineer, and a model and drawing of the\r\nproposed vessel was submitted to the Patent Office. The Secretary of the\r\nNavy, although supporting the project, delayed action until he had\r\nweighed the importance of the batteries in relation to other war needs,\r\nfor at this time the naval shipbuilding program on the Great Lakes was\r\nconsidered of prime importance. He also raised some technical questions\r\nconcerning the design of the batteries, which Fulton answered with a\r\ndescription of the vessel as 138 feet on deck, 120 feet on the keel, 55\r\nfeet beam (each hull to have a 20-foot beam and the \"race\" between to be\r\n15 feet wide), draft 8 or 9 feet loaded, and the intended speed was to\r\nbe 4-1/2 to 5 mph. The ship was to carry 24 long guns (32-pdr.), the\r\nengine was to be 130 hp, and the total cost, $200,000. In his letters to\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, Fulton stated that Adam and Noah Brown would\r\nbuild the hull for $69,800 and that he would build the engine, machinery\r\nand boilers for $78,000, a total of $147,800. He intended to have the\r\nboilers, valves, fastenings, and air pumps of brass or copper, which\r\nwould raise the machinery costs 59 percent above that of stationary\r\nengines and boilers then in use.\r\n\r\nOn May 23, 1814, the Secretary of the Navy authorized the Coast Defense\r\nSociety and its committee to act as Navy agents and to enter into the\r\ncontracts required to build a vessel, and to draw on the Navy\r\nstorekeepers or Navy Yard commandants for such stores or articles on\r\nhand needed for construction. The contracts were prepared and the\r\ncommittee now was officially empowered to act for the Society, with\r\nRutgers, Wolcott, Morris, Dearborn, Mitchill, and Fulton. On June 4,\r\nDearborn asked the Navy Department for $25,000 advance, for work had\r\nstarted. On the 6th, he informed the Secretary that he had been ordered\r\nto assume command of the defenses of Boston and that Rutgers had been\r\nappointed chairman of the construction committee in his place.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the Navy Department was pressed for funds, due to\r\nthe very extensive shipbuilding programs on Lakes Erie, Ontario, and\r\nChamplain in addition to the seagoing vessels being built in some of the\r\ncoastal ports. This was certainly one cause for the Secretary of the\r\nNavy's reluctance to carry out the requirements of the bill passed by\r\nCongress immediately after its signature and, also, this reluctance\r\ncaused the supervisory committee much embarrassment in its\r\nadministration of the contract.\r\n\r\nAnother factor which caused difficulty in the administration of the\r\ncontract was the position of Adam and Noah Brown. The brothers were\r\ndeeply involved in the shipbuilding program on the Lakes, in which they\r\nwere associated at times with Henry Eckford. The Browns constructed a\r\nblockhouse, shops, and quarters at Erie; in addition to Perry's two\r\nbrigs and five of his schooners, they also built some of the Lake\r\nOntario vessels and, later, the _Saratoga_ on Lake Champlain. In their\r\nNew York yard, whose operation continued throughout the war, they built\r\nsome large letter-of-marques: the _General Armstrong_, _Prince de\r\nNeufchatel_, _Zebra_, _Paul Jones_, and some smaller vessels. They also\r\ncut down the 2-decked, merchant ship _China_ into a single flush-deck\r\nletter-of-marque, renamed _Yorktown_; and they had a contract to build\r\nthe sloop-of-war _Peacock_. It is remarkable that the Browns could\r\nundertake and complete so much work between 1813 and 1815 and still be\r\nable to build the steam battery in a very short time.\r\n\r\nWith the contracts in order, the Browns began building. The keels of the\r\nbattery were laid June 20, 1814. It is apparent that the Browns prepared\r\nthe original hull plans, undoubtedly before the building authority was\r\nobtained. The vessel required only about four months to build; she was\r\nlaunched October 29, 1814, at 9 a.m. This was an excellent performance,\r\nconsidering the size of the vessel, the amount of timber required and\r\nhandled in her massive construction, and the other work being done by\r\nthe builders. During the ship's construction, sightseers were a nuisance\r\nand finally guards had to be obtained. During the building of the steam\r\nbattery, work had to be practically stopped on the sloop-of-war\r\n_Peacock_ at one period after she had been partially planked.\r\n\r\nThere were difficulties in obtaining metalwork for the vessel during her\r\nconstruction, due to the blockade and the demand for such material for\r\nother shipbuilding at New York. On November 21, 1814, the ship was towed\r\nfrom the Browns' yard on the East River by Fulton's _Car of Neptune_ and\r\n_Fulton_, each lashed to the sides of the battery, and taken to Fulton's\r\nworks on the North River. There Fulton supervised in person the\r\ncompletion of the vessel and construction of her machinery. Undoubtedly\r\nonly a little of his time was required in inspection of the Browns' work\r\non the battery, for the shipbuilders had been closely associated with\r\nFulton throughout the life of the project and were fully capable as ship\r\ndesigners. The work on the machinery was another matter, however, for\r\nmen capable of working metal were scarce and few workmen could read\r\nplans. Fulton had some of the work done outside of his own plant,\r\nparticularly the brass and copper work (mostly by John Youle's foundry).\r\nAs a result, Fulton was required to move from plant to plant, keeping\r\neach job under almost constant observation and personally supervising\r\nthe workmen. The equipment then available for building a large engine\r\nwas inadequate in many ways. The large steam cylinder presented a\r\nproblem: it had to be recast several times and some of the other parts\r\ngave trouble, either in casting or in machining and fitting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--SCALE MODEL of _Steam Battery_, showing double\r\nhull, in the Museum of History and Technology. (Smithsonian photo\r\nP-63390-D.)]\r\n\r\nGuns for the battery were another problem. Only 3 long guns (32-pdr.),\r\nwere available at the Navy Yard. The Secretary of the Navy promised some\r\ncaptured guns then at Philadelphia. Because of the blockade, these had\r\nto come overland to New York. The captured guns thus obtained were\r\nprobably English, part of the cargo of the British ship _John of\r\nLancaster_ captured by the frigate _President_ early in the war.\r\nApparently 24 guns were obtained this way; only 2 were obtained from the\r\nNavy Yard. In July the Supervising Committee carried out some\r\nexperimental damage studies, in which a 32-pdr. was fired at a target\r\nrepresenting a section of the topsides of the battery. Drawings of the\r\nresult were sent to the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nFurther problems arose over the delays of the government in making\r\npayments: the banks discounted the Treasury notes, so the Committee\r\nmembers had to advance $5,000 out of their own pockets. There was fear\r\nthat British agents might damage the vessel, and although the project\r\nwas undoubtedly known to the British, no evidence of any act of sabotage\r\nwas ever found. Captain David Porter was assigned to the command of the\r\nbattery in November, and it was upon his request that the vessel was\r\nlater rigged with sails.\r\n\r\nWith the _Steam Battery_ approaching completion, the Secretary of the\r\nNavy became more enthusiastic and the construction of other batteries of\r\nthis type was again proposed. Captain Stiles, a Baltimore merchant,\r\noffered to build a steam battery, the hull to cost $50,000; the entire\r\ncost of the vessel, $150,000, was raised in Baltimore and the frames of\r\na battery erected. Another battery was projected at Philadelphia and the\r\nSecretary of the Navy wanted one or more built at Sackett's Harbor, but\r\nnaval officers and Fulton objected. A bill put before Congress to\r\nauthorize another half million to build steam batteries passed the first\r\nreading January 9, 1815, went to the House February 22, 1815, but the\r\nend of the war prevented any further action on it.\r\n\r\nOn February 24, 1815, Fulton died. He had been to Trenton, New Jersey,\r\nto attend a hearing on the steamboat monopoly and, on the way back, the\r\nferry on North River was caught in the ice. Fulton and his lawyer,\r\nEmmet, had to walk over the ice to get ashore. On the way, Emmet fell\r\nthrough and Fulton got wet and chilled while helping him. After two or\r\nthree days in bed Fulton went to his foundry to inspect the battery's\r\nmachinery causing a relapse from which he died. This resulted in some\r\ndelay in completing the machinery and stopped work on the _Mute_, an\r\n80-foot, manually propelled, torpedo boat that Fulton was having built\r\nin the Browns' yard.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to suspend work on the Baltimore battery after an\r\nexpenditure of $61,500, but the New York battery was to be completed to\r\nprove the project was practical. The final payment of $50,000 was made\r\nfour months after it was requested.\r\n\r\nCharles Stoudinger, Fulton's foreman or superintendent, was able to\r\ncomplete and install the ship's machinery. On June 10, 1815, the vessel\r\nwas given a short trial run in the harbor with Stoudinger and the Navy\r\ninspector, Captain Smith, on board. This trial revealed the need of some\r\nmechanical alterations; sails were not used, and it was found she could\r\nstem the strong tide and a fresh headwind. The vessel also was visited\r\nby the officers of French men-of-war at anchor in the harbor.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1815, she was given another trial. She left Fulton's works at\r\nCorlear's Hook at 9 a.m., ran out to Sandy Hook Lighthouse, bore west\r\nand returned, a total of 53 miles under steam, reaching her slip at 5:20\r\np.m. She was found to steer \"like a pilot boat.\" This prolonged trial\r\nrevealed that the stokehold was not sufficiently ventilated and more\r\ndeck openings were required. The windsails used in existing hatches were\r\ninadequate. The paddle wheel was too low and had to be raised 18 inches,\r\nand there were still some desirable modifications to be made in the\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nOn September 11, 1815, she was again given a trial run. All alterations\r\nhad been made, including the addition of hatches and raising the paddle\r\nwheel, and her battery was on board with all stores, supplies, and\r\nequipment. She had 26 long guns (32-pdr.), mounted on pivoted carriages,\r\nand now drew 10 feet 4 inches. On this day she left her slip at 8:38\r\na.m. and went through the Narrows into the Lower Bay, where she\r\nmaneuvered around the new frigate _Java_ at anchor there. The battery\r\nthen was given a thorough trial under steam and sail and, with the ship\r\nunderway, her guns were fired to see if concussion would damage the\r\nmachinery. The vessel was found to be a practical one, capable of\r\nmeeting the government's requirements in all respects; her speed was\r\n5-1/2 knots. However, the stokehold temperature had reached 116°\r\nFahrenheit! She returned to her slip at 7:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nOn December 28, 1815, the Committee in a written report to the\r\nSecretary of the Navy,[5] gave a description of the vessel and praised\r\nher performance. At this time a set of plans was made by \"Mr. Morgan,\"\r\nof whom no other reference has appeared, and sent to the Navy\r\nDepartment. These cannot now be found. The Committee recommended the\r\nbattery be commissioned and used for training purposes. This suggestion\r\nwas not followed.\r\n\r\nThe ship remained in her slip during the winter, and in June 1816 she\r\nwas turned over to the Navy and delivered to Captain Samuel Evans,\r\ncommandant of the New York Navy Yard. Captain Joseph Bainbridge was\r\nassigned to her command. However, she was not commissioned and soon\r\nafter her delivery she was housed over and placed \"in ordinary,\" that\r\nis, laid up. The final settlement showed that the Committee, as Navy\r\nagents, had paid out $286,162.12 with $872.00 unpaid, as well as a claim\r\nfor $3,364.00 by Adam and Noah Brown, making a total of $290,398.12.\r\n\r\nThe following year, on June 18, 1817, she was unroofed and put into\r\nservice with a small crew. With President James Monroe on board, she\r\nleft the Navy Yard about noon for a short trip to the Narrows and then\r\nto Staten Island and returned in the evening. The next day she was again\r\nplaced \"in ordinary.\"\r\n\r\nFour years later, in 1821, when her guns and machinery were removed, it\r\nwas found that she was rapidly becoming rotten. She was then utilized as\r\na receiving ship. At 2:30 p.m. on June 4, 1829, she blew up, killing 24\r\nmen and 1 woman, with 19 persons listed as injured. Among those killed\r\nwas one officer, Lt. S. M. Brackenridge. Two lieutenants and a Sailing\r\nMaster were hurt, four midshipmen were severely injured, and five\r\npersons were listed as missing. The explosion of 2-1/2 barrels of\r\ncondemned gunpowder was sufficient, due to her rotten condition, to\r\ndestroy the ship completely. A Court of Inquiry blamed a 60-year-old\r\ngunner, who supposedly entered a magazine with a candle to get powder\r\nfor the evening gun. It was stated to the court that about 300 pounds of\r\npowder in casks and in cartridges was on board the ship at the time.[3]\r\n\r\nShe was not replaced until the coast-defense steamer _Fulton_ was built\r\nin 1837-38, though in 1822 the Navy purchased for $16,000 a \"steam\r\ngalliot\" of 100 tons, the _Sea Gull_, to be used as a dispatch boat for\r\nthe West Indian squadron engaged in suppressing piracy during 1823. In\r\n1825 she was laid up at Philadelphia, and in 1840 she was sold for\r\n$4,750.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the battery did not receive an official name,\r\nas did the sailing blockship on the ways at New Orleans, which at the\r\nend of the War of 1812 was officially listed as the _Tchifonta_. Nor was\r\nthe battery given a number, as were the gunboats. In official\r\ncorrespondence and lists, the steam battery is referred to as the\r\n\"Fulton Steam Frigate,\" or as the \"Steam Battery,\" but in later years\r\nshe was referred to as the \"Fulton\" or \"Fulton the First.\" Perhaps the\r\nexplanation is that as she was the only one of her kind she was not\r\nnumbered, and as she was not considered fit for coastal or extended\r\nocean voyages, she was not given a name.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurviving Designs for Floating Batteries\r\n\r\nThe designs of American blockships that have survived are those of the\r\n_Tchifonta_,[6] 145 feet long, 43-foot moulded beam, 8-foot 6-inch depth\r\nin hold, and about 152 feet 9 inches on deck. She was to carry a battery\r\nof 22 long guns (32-pdr.), on the main deck 12 carronades (42-pdr.), on\r\nforecastle and quarter decks. She was to have been rigged to rather\r\nlofty and very square topgallant sails, and would have been capable of\r\nsailing fairly well, though of rather shoal draft, drawing only about 8\r\nfeet 6 inches when ready for service. She was sold on the stocks at the\r\nend of the war and her later history is not known.\r\n\r\nAnother and earlier design for a blockship, or floating battery, was\r\nprepared by Christian Bergh for Captain Charles Stewart in 1806. This\r\nwas a sailing vessel for the defense of the port of New York, planned to\r\nmount 40 guns (32-pdr.), on her two lower decks and 14 carronades\r\n(42-pdr.), on her spar deck. She was to be 103 feet 6 inches between\r\nperpendiculars, a 44-foot moulded beam, 10-foot depth of hold, and\r\ndrawing about 9 feet when ready for service. She was intended to be\r\nship-rigged, but was never built.[7] A few small sloop-rigged block\r\nvessels also were built during Jefferson's administration. The\r\nsloop-of-war _Saratoga_, built on Lake Champlain by the Browns, in 1813,\r\nwas practically a blockship. A plan for a proposed \"Guard Ship,\" or\r\n\"Floating Battery,\" was made by James Marsh at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, in 1814. This was an unrigged battery, 200 feet extreme\r\nlength, 50-foot moulded beam, 9-foot depth of hold, to mount 32 guns\r\n(42-pdr.), on a flush deck, with a covering deck above.[8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--DESIGN FOR AN UNRIGGED FLOATING BATTERY\r\nproposed by James Marsh, Charleston, South Carolina, March 14, 1814.]\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of the trustees of the National Maritime Museum,\r\nGreenwich, England, the Rigsarkivet, Copenhagen, Denmark, and the\r\nStatens Sjöhistoriska Museum, Stockholm, Sweden, the author has been\r\nable to illustrate in this article the designs of some of the early\r\nfloating batteries.\r\n\r\nIn the last quarter of the 18th century and later, the Danes had built\r\nsail-propelled floating batteries or blockships, which were employed in\r\nthe defense of Copenhagen. The British built at least one sail-propelled\r\nbattery, the _Spanker_, in 1794. This was a scow of very angular form\r\nwith overhanging gun-deck, bomb-ketch-rigged, and about 120 feet overall\r\n42-foot 4 inches moulded beam and 8-foot depth of hold. She is said to\r\nhave been a failure due to her unseaworthy proportions and form; the\r\noverhanging gun deck and sides were objected to in particular. She is\r\ncalled a \"Stationary Battery\" in her plans, which are in the Admiralty\r\nCollection of Draughts, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nControversial Descriptions\r\n\r\nThe contemporary descriptions of the Fulton _Steam Battery_ do not\r\nagree. This was in part due to differences between the dimensions given\r\nout by Fulton during the negotiations with the Federal Government, and\r\nafter the ship's construction was authorized. From the context of\r\nvarious statements concerning the projected vessel, such as that of the\r\nnaval officers, the changes in the intended dimensions of the ship can\r\nbe seen. For example, the officers state the model and plan shown them\r\nwould produce a battery carrying 24 guns (24- and 32-pdrs.), and a letter\r\nfrom Fulton to Jones,[9] shows she was to be 138 feet on deck and\r\n55-foot beam. The final reported dimensions, given by the Supervisory\r\nCommittee,[10] are 156 feet length, 56 feet beam, and 20 feet depth.\r\n\r\nIn addition there are a few foreign accounts which give dimensions and\r\ndescriptions. The most complete was probably that of Jean Baptiste\r\nMarestier, a French naval constructor who visited the United States soon\r\nafter the end of the War of 1812 and published a report on American\r\nsteamboats in 1824.[11] The _Steam Battery_ is barely mentioned though a\r\ndrawing of one of her boilers is given. Marestier made another report on\r\nthe American Navy, however. Extensive searches have been made for this\r\nin Paris over the last 14 years, but this paper has not been found in\r\nany of the French archives. References to the original text indicate\r\nthat the naval report dealt very extensively with the _Steam Battery_.\r\nSome of his comments on the battery appeared in _Procès-verbaux des\r\nSéances de l'Académie des Sciences_.[12] Marestier considered the powers\r\nof the battery to have been overrated due to fanciful accounts of some\r\nlaymen writers. He was aware of the shortcomings of the double hull in a\r\nsteam vessel at the then-possible speeds, but he apparently thought two\r\nengines, one in each hull and each with its boilers would be better than\r\nFulton's arrangement of boilers in one hull and engine in the other. He\r\nnoted that the paddle wheel turned 16-18 rpm and that steam pressure\r\nsustained a column of mercury 25 to 35 centimeters. The safety valve was\r\nset at 50 centimeters. Fuel consumption was 3-5/8 cords of pine wood per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nIn view of the access Marestier is known to have had to American naval\r\nconstructors, shipbuilders, and engineers, it is highly probable that he\r\nnot only obtained the building plan of the ship but also some of the\r\nearlier project plans from the builders and from Fulton's\r\nsuperintendent, Stoudinger. It is, therefore, a great misfortune that\r\nhis lengthy report on the _Battery_ cannot be produced.\r\n\r\nA French naval officer who investigated the ship, M. Montgéry, also\r\nwrote a description, published in \"Notice sur la Vie et les Travaux de\r\nRobert Fulton.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--FLOATING BATTERY _Spanker_ built, in England\r\nby William Barnard, at Deptford on the Thames, and launched June 14,\r\n1794. Rigged as a bomb ketch, its length is 111 feet 7 inches in the\r\nkeel, extreme beam 42 feet 4 inches, depth of hold 8 feet. Upper deck\r\nplan also shown.]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted in regard to what Montgéry wrote about the\r\n_Battery_, that in 1821 it had been considered desirable to disarm the\r\nship. The engineer in charge, William Purcell, had reported that as\r\nthere were not proper scuppers, dirt and water had entered the hull and\r\nhad collected under the engine and boilers, causing damage to the hull,\r\nand also that with guns removed, the _Battery_ would float too high for\r\nthe paddle wheel to propel the vessel; so it had been decided to remove\r\nall machinery as well as the armament.\r\n\r\nMontgéry's description, published in 1822, was taken from his report to\r\nthe Minister of Marine and Colonies. It noted the battery was made of\r\ntwo hulls separated by a channel, or \"race,\" 15-1/2 feet wide, running\r\nthe full length of the vessel. The two hulls were joined by a deck just\r\nabove the waterline, as well as by an upper deck, and also connected at\r\ntheir keels by means of 12 oak beams each 1 foot square. The vessel was\r\n152 feet long, 57 feet beam, and 20 feet deep. Sides were 4 feet 10\r\ninches thick, and the ends of the hull were rounded and alike. There\r\nwere two rudders at each end, one on each hull, alongside the race. The\r\neight paddle blades, each 14-1/2 feet by 3 feet, turned in either\r\ndirection by stopping the engine piston at half-stroke and reversing the\r\nflow of steam. Rigged with two lateen sails and two jibs, the ship\r\nsailed either end first. The engine of 120 hp was in one hull and two\r\nboilers were in the other. Other sources, Marestier, and Colden in\r\n_Procès-verbaux des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences_,[14] gave\r\nadditional information (some of it incorrect): the engine was inclined,\r\nwith a 4-foot-diameter cylinder, 5-foot stroke, direct-connected to the\r\npaddle wheel, which was turned at 18 rpm. The boilers were 8 × 22 feet\r\nwith the fireboxes in inside cylinders, each about 5 feet in diameter,\r\nand extending about half the length of the boiler from the fire doors.\r\nTwo fire tubes, each about 3 feet in diameter, returned the gases from\r\nthe inside end of the fireboxes to the stacks at the firing end. Except\r\nat the fire-door end, the firebox was completely surrounded by water.\r\nThe boiler pressure of about 6 psi was not maintained, varying somewhat\r\nwith each stroke of the engine.\r\n\r\nWater level in the boilers was indicated by try cocks. The safety valve\r\nwas controlled by a counterbalanced lever. A jet of salt water was\r\ninjected into the exhaust trunk to form a vacuum by condensation. An air\r\npump transferred condensate and sea water into a tank from which it\r\npassed overboard. Only about a tenth of this water was returned to the\r\nboilers.\r\n\r\nMontgéry stated also that only the lower or gun deck was to be armed. No\r\nbulwarks were on the spar deck, only iron stanchions to which were\r\nfastened a breastwork of wet cotton bales when the _Steam Battery_ was\r\nin action.\r\n\r\nThe _Battery_ was designed to carry 30 guns (32-pdr.), with 3 guns in\r\neach end and 12 on each side, but no guns in the wake of paddle wheel\r\nand machinery. Hatches to give air to the stokehold were located\r\namidships. The _Battery_ was to have been supplemented at the ends of\r\neach hull by a Columbiad \"submarine gun\" (100-pdr.), Fulton's invention,\r\nbut these were not fitted. Provision was to be made in the fireboxes for\r\nheating shot, and a force pump with a cylinder 33 inches in diameter was\r\nemployed to throw a stream of cold water, about 60-80 gallons per\r\nminute, for a distance of about two hundred feet. This could be done\r\nonly when the paddle wheel was not in operation. The paddle wheel was\r\nhoused, the top fitted with stairs to the spar deck. The gun deck, over\r\nthe race, was used in part for staterooms, of which the bulkheads were\r\npermanent. Hammocks for the complement of 500 men were to be slung on\r\nthe rest of the gun deck. The ship drew 10 feet 4 inches, with the port\r\nsills about 5-1/2 feet above the loadline. Burning wood, the vessel\r\ncould carry about 4 days' supply of fuel; burning coal, she carried 12\r\ndays' supply.\r\n\r\nMontgéry said that the vessel would be vulnerable to bombshells and hot\r\nshot, and that furthermore she could be boarded. The displacement of the\r\nship, at service draft, was 1,450 tons, a figure Montgéry obtained from\r\na copy of the original plan given him by Noah Brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--FRENCH SKETCH, in Rigsarkivet, Copenhagen, of\r\ninboard profile and arrangement of Fulton's _Steam Battery_, showing\r\ndetails of the Fulton engine, probably taken from one of his preliminary\r\ndesigns.]\r\n\r\nIn 1935, Lieutenant Ralph R. Gurley, USN, attempted a reconstruction in\r\nsketches of the vessel published in his article \"The U.S.S. _Fulton_ the\r\nFirst\" in the _U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings_.[15] This\r\nreconstruction was based on the Patent Office drawing prepared for\r\nFulton, and published by Stuart and Bennett, and the foregoing French\r\nsources. The Patent Office drawing showed the engine was an inclined\r\ncylinder and Lt. Gurley shows this in his sketch; in his text (p. 323)\r\nhe says, \"The engine was an inclined, single-cylinder affair with a\r\n4-foot base and a 5-foot stroke.\" Gurley's attempt to reconstruct the\r\n_Steam Battery_ is the only one known to the author.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopenhagen Plans\r\n\r\nIn 1960, Kjeld Rasmussen, naval architect of the Danish Greenland\r\nCompany, was requested by the author to inspect in the Danish Royal\r\nArchives at Copenhagen a folio of American ship plans, the index of\r\nwhich had listed some Civil War river monitors. Mr. Rasmussen found the\r\nmonitor plans had been withdrawn but discovered that three plans of\r\nFulton's _Steam Battery_ existed, as well as plans of the first\r\n_Princeton_, a screw sloop-of-war.\r\n\r\nCopies of the _Steam Battery's_ plans were obtained at Copenhagen in\r\nSeptember 1960 through the courtesy of the archivist, and were found to\r\nconsist of the lines, copied in 1817, an inboard profile and\r\narrangement, and a sail and rigging plan. From these the reconstruction\r\nfor a scale model was drawn and is presented here with reproductions of\r\nthe original drawings upon which the reconstruction is based.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that Montgéry's description is generally accurate. The\r\nvessel is a catamaran, made of two hulls, double-ended and exactly\r\nalike. The outboard sides are \"moulded,\" with round bilges, the inboard\r\nsides are straight and flat, as though a hull had been split along the\r\nmiddle line and then planked up flat where split. The hulls are\r\nseparated by the race, in which the paddle wheel is placed at\r\nmid-length. The topsides are made elliptical at the ends, and the\r\nmidsection shows a marked tumble-home over the thick topside planking\r\nbut less on the moulded lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.]\r\n\r\nThe lines plan agreed rather closely to Montgéry's description of the\r\nhull. After careful fairing it was found the lines drawing would produce\r\na vessel 153 feet 2 inches overall outside the stems, or about 151 feet\r\nover the planked rabbets, with a moulded beam of 56 feet and extreme\r\nbeam of 58 feet. The moulded depth was 22 feet 9 inches and the width of\r\nthe race was 14 feet 10 inches, plank to plank. The room and space of\r\nframing shown was 2 feet. The designed draft appears to be 13 feet and\r\nthis would bring the port sills 5 feet 6 inches above the loadline and\r\nthe underside of the gun-deck beams about 2 feet 9 inches above the\r\nloadline.\r\n\r\nThe lines plan is a Danish copy, probably of the building plan by Noah\r\nBrown, and may be based on the plan Montgéry obtained from Brown. The\r\nspar deck has the iron stanchions (Gurley translated these as\r\n\"chandeliers\") which are set inboard 4 feet from the plank-sheer. This\r\ngives room for cotton bales, outboard the stanchions, to form a\r\nbarricade. As will be seen by comparing the original Danish drawing with\r\nthe model drawing, the construction indicates that the iron stanchions\r\nshould be carried around the ends of the hull in the same manner as\r\nalong the sides, since the lower ends of the iron stanchions pass\r\nthrough the spar deck and are secured to the inside of the inner ceiling\r\nof the gun deck. The rudders are as shown in the Danish drawing, and it\r\nis supposed that they were operated ferryboat fashion, one at each end\r\nof the vessel. Hence, each pair of rudders was toggled together by a\r\ncross-yoke. This was probably operated by a tiller (possibly the\r\ncross-yokes and tillers were of iron) pivoted under the beams of the gun\r\ndeck close to the ends of the ship. Tiller ropes led from a tackle under\r\nthe gun-deck through trunks to the spar deck, where the wheels were\r\nplaced. This allowed proper sweep to the tillers and operation of each\r\npair of rudders. The paddle wheel was apparently of iron, with wooden\r\nblades, and agrees with Montgéry's description. In the plan for the\r\nmodel it is shown raised 18 inches above the original design position,\r\nto agree with trial requirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--ORIGINAL LINES OF ROBERT FULTON'S _Steam\r\nBattery_, a Danish copy dated September 12, 1817; found in Rigsarkivet,\r\nCopenhagen.]\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the close CL-to-CL frame spacing created a\r\nhull having frames touching one another, at least to above the turn of\r\nthe bilge, so the vessel was almost solid timber, before being planked\r\nand ceiled, from keel to about the loadline. The sides are not only\r\nheavily planked but, after the frames were ceiled with extraordinarily\r\nheavy, square timbering, a supplementary solid, vertical framing was\r\nintroduced inboard and another ceiling added. The sides scale about 5\r\nfeet from outside the plank to the inboard face of the inner ceiling at\r\nthe level of the gunports.\r\n\r\nThe hulls were tied together athwartship by the deck beams of the gun\r\ndeck and spar deck, except in the wake of the paddle wheel. Knees were\r\nplaced along the sides of the race at alternate gun-deck beams. In\r\naddition, the 12 1-foot-square timbers, crossing the race at the rabbets\r\nof the hulls, (mentioned by Montgéry) are shown. These must have created\r\nextraordinary resistance, even at the low speed of this steamer. The\r\ndeck details shown are the results of reconstruction of the inboard\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of Double-Hull Craft\r\n\r\nThe use of catamaran hulls, or \"double-hulls,\" has been periodically\r\npopular with ship designers since the time of Charles II of England. The\r\nearliest of such vessels known in the present day were four sloops or\r\nshallops designed 1673-1687 by Sir William Petty, who was an inventor in\r\nthe field of naval architecture and received some attention from Charles\r\nII and from the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThe first Petty experiment, the _Simon & Jude_, later called _Invention\r\nI_, was launched October 28, 1662. She was designed with two hulls\r\ncylindrical in cross section, each 2 feet in diameter, and 20 feet long.\r\nA platform connected the hulls, giving the boat a beam of a little over\r\n9 feet. She had a 20-foot mast stepped on one of the crossbeams\r\nconnecting the hulls, with a single gaff sail. In sailing trials she\r\nbeat three fast boats: the King's barge, a large pleasure boat, and a\r\nman-of-war's boat. This \"double-bottom,\" also called a \"sluiceboat\" or\r\n\"cylinder,\" was later lengthened at the stern to make her 30 feet\r\noverall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.]\r\n\r\nThe King did not support Petty, to the latter's great disappointment,\r\nand Petty next built a larger double-bottom, _Invention II_. This\r\ncatamaran was lapstrake construction. Not much is known of this boat\r\nexcept that she beat the regular Irish packet boat, running between\r\nHolyhead and Dublin, in a race each way, winning a £20 wager. She was\r\nlaunched in July 1663; what became of her was not recorded.\r\n\r\nA third and still larger boat, the _Experiment_, launched December 22,\r\n1664, appears to have been a large sloop. This vessel sailed by way of\r\nthe Thames in April 1665 and went to Oporto, Portugal. She left Portugal\r\nOctober 20, 1665, for home, but apparently went down with all hands in a\r\nsevere storm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--DANISH COPY OF ORIGINAL SAIL PLAN of Robert\r\nFulton's _Steam Battery_, dated September 12, 1817, in Rigsarkivet,\r\nCopenhagen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--LINES OF FULTON'S _Steam Battery_, as\r\nreconstructed for a model in the Museum of History and Technology.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--A RECONSTRUCTION OF INBOARD WORKS of the\r\n_Steam Battery_, for construction of the model in the Museum of History\r\nand Technology.]\r\n\r\nFor 18 years Petty did no more with the type, but finally, in July\r\n1684, he laid down a still larger sloop with two decks and a mast\r\nstanding 55 feet above her upper deck. She was named _St. Michael the\r\nArchangel_ and is probably the design in Pepys' _Book of Miscellaneous\r\nIllustrations_ in Magdalene College, Cambridge, England. This vessel\r\nproved unmanageable and was a complete failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--MODEL LINES REDRAWN to outside of plank to\r\nshow hydrodynamic form of the _Steam Battery_.]\r\n\r\nThough the double canoes of the Pacific Islands were probably known to\r\nsome in Europe in 1662, there is no evidence that Petty based his\r\ndesigns on such craft. He appears to have produced his designs\r\nspontaneously from independent observations and resulting theories.\r\nBefore Petty concluded his experiments, a number of double-hull craft\r\nhad been produced by others; however, some \"double\" craft, such as\r\n\"double shallops\" may have been \"double-enders,\" as shown by a\r\n\"double-moses boat\" of the 18th century and later.[16]\r\n\r\nThe use of two canoes, joined by a platform or by poles was common in\r\ncolonial times; in Maryland and Virginia, dugouts so joined were used to\r\ntransport tobacco down the tidal creeks to vessels' loading. Such craft\r\nwere also used as ferries. M. V. Brewington's _Chesapeake Bay Log\r\nCanoes_[17] and Paul Wilstack's _Potomac Landings_[18] illustrate canoes\r\nused in this manner. A catamaran galley, two round-bottom hulls, flat on\r\nthe inboard side (a hull split along the centerline and the inboard\r\nfaces planked up), 113 feet long and each hull a 7-foot moulded beam,\r\n6-foot 6 inches moulded depth, and placed 13 feet apart, was proposed by\r\nSir Sidney Smith, R.N., in the 1790's, and built by the British\r\nAdmiralty. Named _Taurus_, she is shown by the Admiralty draught to have\r\nbeen a double-ender, with cabins amidships on the platform, an iron\r\nrudder at each end (between the hulls) steered with tillers (to unship),\r\nand with a ramp at one end. The plans are undated, signed by Captain Sir\r\nSidney Smith, and a field-carriage gun is shown at the ramp end of the\r\nboat. This, and the heavy rocker in the keels, suggests the _Taurus_ was\r\nintended for a landing boat. No sailing rig is indicated, but tholes for\r\n12 oars or sweeps on each side are shown. The oarsmen apparently sat on\r\ndeck, or on low seats, with stretchers in hatches between each pair of\r\ntholes (Admiralty Collection of Draughts, The National Maritime Museum,\r\nGreenwich, England).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--GENERAL PLAN of the _Taurus_, a catamaran\r\ngalley gunboat proposed by Sir Sidney Smith, R.N., to the British\r\nAdmiralty in the early years of the French Revolution. From the\r\nAdmiralty Collection of Draughts, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.]\r\n\r\nAnother experimenter with the double-hull type of vessel was a wealthy\r\nScot named Patrick Miller who was particularly interested in manual\r\npropulsion of vessels, employing geared capstans to operate paddle\r\nwheels. In a letter dated June 9, 1790, Miller offered Gustav III of\r\nSweden a design for a double-hulled 144-gun ship-of-the-line (rating as\r\na 130-gun ship) propelled by manually operated capstans connected to a\r\npaddle wheel between the hulls. She was rigged to sail, with five masts\r\nand was to be 246 feet long, 63 feet beam, and 17 feet draft; the hulls\r\nwere 16 feet apart.\r\n\r\nThis project was submitted by the King to Fredrik Henrik af Chapman, the\r\ngreat Swedish naval architect, who made an adverse report. Chapman\r\npointed out in great detail that the weight of the armament, the\r\nnecessary hull structure, the stores, crew, ammunition, spars, sails,\r\nrigging and gear, would greatly exceed Miller's designed displacement.\r\nHe also pointed out the prime fault of catamarans under sail--slow\r\nturning in stays. He suggested that the speed under sail would be\r\ndisappointing. He doubted that a double-hull ship of such size could be\r\nbuilt strong enough to stand a heavy sea. He remarked that English\r\nrecords showed that a small vessel of the catamaran type had been built\r\nbetween 1680 and 1700 which had sailed well (this may have been one of\r\nPetty's boats), and that \"36 years ago\" he had seen 8 miles from London,\r\na similar boat that had been newly built by Lord Baltimore and was about\r\n50 feet long; this was a failure and was discarded after one trial.\r\nTherefore, said Chapman, the Miller project was not new but rather an\r\nold idea. Chapman's final remark is perhaps the best illustration of his\r\nopinion of the catamaran, \"Despite all this, two-hull vessels are\r\ncompletely sound when the theory can be properly applied; that is in\r\nvessels of very light weight, and of small size, with crews of one or\r\ntwo men.\"\r\n\r\nA \"model\" of such a double-hull ship--the _Experiment_, built at Leith,\r\nScotland, in 1786 by J. Laurie--was sent to Sweden by Miller. She was\r\n105 feet long, 31 feet beam, and cost £3000. This vessel arrived in the\r\nsummer of 1790 and King Gustav in a letter dated July 26 ordered Col.\r\nMichael Anckerswärd to welcome the vessel at Stockholm. The King\r\npresented Miller with a gold snuffbox and a painting was made of the\r\nvessel. The _Experiment_ had five paddle wheels in tandem between her\r\nhulls, operated by geared capstans on deck. These gave her a speed of 5\r\nknots but caused the crew to suffer from exhaustion in a short time. The\r\nvessel was badly strained in a storm and was finally abandoned at St.\r\nPetersburg, Russia.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.]\r\n\r\nMiller later turned to the idea of employing steam instead of manual\r\npower and built a 25-foot double-hulled pleasure boat of iron fitted\r\nwith a steam engine built by William Symington. Also named _Experiment_,\r\nshe was an apparent success, so Miller had a 60-foot boat built of the\r\ndouble-hull design and fitted with an engine built by Symington. She\r\nreached a speed of 7 mph on the Forth and Clyde Canal. However, Miller\r\nlost interest when he found that the Symington engine was unreliable and\r\nthat Great Britain showed very little public support for such projects.\r\n\r\nFulton was acquainted with Symington's work and probably had heard of\r\nMiller's vessels. At any rate, he employed the double-hull principle in\r\nhis steam ferryboats, the first of which was the _Jersey_, a 188-ton\r\nvessel built by Charles Browne, which began service July 2, 1812. The\r\nnext year he had a sister ship built, the _York_. These vessels were\r\nbased on his patent drawing of 1809. In 1814 he had another vessel of\r\nthis type built, the _Nassau_. It was, therefore, logical that he should\r\napply this design to the _Steam Battery_. The double-hull design had\r\nworked well in these ferries, and the design would give protection from\r\nshot to the paddle wheel. The _Battery_ would have the ability to run\r\nforward or astern so as not to be exposed to a raking fire from the\r\nenemy while maneuvering in action. The application of this \"ferryboat\"\r\nprinciple to the _Battery_ reduced the need for extreme maneuverability,\r\nthe catamaran's weakest point, even at low speed.\r\n\r\nThe resistance factors in the design are of relatively small importance,\r\nfor the speed possible under steam in this period was very low. However,\r\nthe plans show an apparently efficient hull form for the power\r\navailable, aside from the drag of the beams across the race in the\r\nvicinity of the keel. The displacement was adequate. The height of the\r\ngun-deck above the water at the race made the _Battery_ unsuitable for\r\nrough-water operation, but there is no evidence that Fulton or the\r\nsponsors of the vessel considered the _Battery_ as a coastwise or\r\nseagoing steamer. However, the clearance of the gun deck above the water\r\nand the dip of the paddle wheel would have made the additional weight of\r\nan upper- or spar-deck battery prohibitive even had experience in action\r\nproven it desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSail and Inboard Plans\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--LINES OF _Taurus_. From the Admiralty\r\nCollection of Draughts, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.]\r\n\r\nThe sail and rigging plan is likewise a Danish copy and shows the\r\ntwo-masted lateen rig employed. The hull is shown with bulwarks and\r\ngunports on the spar deck but no other evidence that the _Battery_ was\r\nfinished in this manner has been found. The rig resembles that of some\r\nof Josiah Fox's designs for Jeffersonian gunboats--double-enders\r\ndesigned to sail in either direction but without the jibs. The topmasts\r\ndo not appear to be more than signal poles and apparently were not\r\nfitted with sails; however, some European lateeners did have triangular\r\ntopsails over a lateen and it is possible the _Battery_ may have carried\r\nsuch sails. Considering the stability and displacement of the _Battery_,\r\nthe rig is very small and not sufficiently effective. Shrouds were not\r\nrequired; the masts were supported by runners that were shifted when the\r\nyards were reversed, and in tacking. Apparently the jibstays also could\r\nbe slacked off so that the lateen yards would not have to be dipped\r\nunder them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--RUDDER DETAIL of _Taurus_. From the Admiralty\r\nCollection of Draughts, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.]\r\n\r\nThe inboard profile is on tracing paper and the notes are in French.\r\nThis drawing is of a simplified hull form having flat-bottom hulls with\r\nchines. It is possible that this is a tracing of a preliminary drawing\r\nobtained by Marestier or Montgéry, but no documentation can be found.\r\nIts importance is that it shows in some detail the engine and boilers,\r\nas well as the wheelbox, and another drawing of the paddle wheel, more\r\nor less duplicating the wheel shown in the Danish plan. No details of\r\nthe deck arrangements are shown in any of the plans, except for the dome\r\nskylight over the fireroom in the boiler hull.\r\n\r\nBoth the lines plan and the inboard drawing show construction\r\nmidsections and hull connections. These plans show that the engine was\r\nnot inclined, but rather was vertical, contrary to Fulton's patent\r\ndrawing. The piston rod and the crosshead obviously passed through its\r\ngun deck in a large hatch. Also it is plain that there must have been\r\nlarge hatches afore and abaft the wheelbox to make the stepped wheelbox\r\nconstruction desirable. There also must have been a hatch in the gun\r\ndeck under the domed skylight. It is improbable that the engine and\r\nskylight hatches were used for ladderways, passing scuttles, or\r\ncompanionways.\r\n\r\nThe boilers are shown in the inboard profile about as described and\r\ndrawn by Marestier but with two stacks on each boiler, one to each flue;\r\nMarestier's sketch in his report on American steamships shows the flues\r\nof each boiler trunked into a single stack. The battery had two boilers\r\nand the stacks are at the boilers' fire-door end. The steam lines came\r\noff the crown of the boilers and probably passed through the ends of the\r\nwheelbox to the engine; a trunk for the steam lines would undoubtedly\r\nhave been necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--SKETCH OF 130-GUN SHIP proposed by Patrick\r\nMiller to King Gustav III of Sweden in 1790. In Statens Sjöhistoriska\r\nMuseum, Stockholm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--PATRICK MILLER'S manually propelled\r\n(paddle-wheel) catamaran ship _Experiment_, built at Leith, Scotland,\r\n1786. Scale drawing in Statens Sjöhistoriska Museum, Stockholm.]\r\n\r\nThe engine is shown to have had counterbalanced side levers, one on\r\neach side, and a single flywheel on the outboard side. The cylinder is\r\nover the condenser or \"cistern,\" connected by the steam line and valve\r\nbox on the side. The cylinder crosshead is shown in the inboard profile\r\nto have reached the underside of the beams of the upper deck. The\r\ncrosshead was connected by two connecting rods to the side levers. These\r\nlevers operated the paddle wheel by connecting rods to cranks on the\r\npaddle-wheel shaft. There is another pair of connecting rods from the\r\nside levers to the crosshead of the air pump. All connecting rods are on\r\none arm of the side levers, the other end having only a counterbalance\r\nweight beyond the fulcrum bearing. The flywheel has a shaft fitted with\r\ntwo gears, and is driven through idler gears from gears on the\r\npaddle-wheel shaft; it turns at about twice the speed of the paddle\r\nwheel. No other pumps or fittings are shown in the engine hull, although\r\nmanual pumps were probably fitted to fill and empty the boilers. Piping\r\nis not shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--PAINTING OF THE _Experiment_ in the Statens\r\nSjöhistoriska Museum, Stockholm.]\r\n\r\nThe four rudders, toggled in pairs, are shown in both the lines and\r\ninboard drawings, but the shape is different in the two plans. Operation\r\nmust have been by a tiller under the gun-deck beams. The outer end of\r\nthe tiller may have been pivoted on the toggle bar and the inboard end\r\nfitted, as previously described, with steering cable or chain tackles.\r\nThis seems to be the only practical interpretation of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nReconstructing the Plans\r\n\r\nIn the model it was necessary to reconstruct the deck arrangements\r\nwithout enough contemporary description. The outboard appearance and\r\nhull form, rig, and arrangement of armament require no reconstruction,\r\nfor all that is of importance is shown in the lines and rig drawings, or\r\nin the inboard profile. The masts are shown to have been stepped over\r\nthe race on the gun deck. The iron stanchions are shown in the lines\r\ndrawing and in the construction section. However, their position at the\r\nends of the _Battery_ are apparently incorrectly shown in the original\r\nlines plan. The construction section shows these stanchions to have been\r\nstepped on the inside face of the inner ceiling and, as the ceiling\r\nstructure was carried completely around the ship, the stanchions in the\r\nends must have been placed inboard, as along the sides. The bowsprit was\r\nabove deck and would probably be secured in the knighthead timbers at\r\nthe ends of the hull, as well as by the heel bitts shown in the Danish\r\nlines drawing. With the riding bitts shown inboard of the heel bitts at\r\neach end of the vessel, it is obvious that she would work her ground\r\ntackle at both ends and would therefore require two capstans; the\r\nwheelbox would prevent effective use of a single one. The capstans might\r\nbe doubleheaded, as in some large frigates and ships-of-the-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--SAIL PLAN OF FULTON'S _Steam Battery_ as\r\nreconstructed for model in the Museum of History and Technology.]\r\n\r\nAs to the remaining deck fixtures, hatches and fittings, these must be\r\nentirely a matter of speculation. Ladderways, passing scuttles, hatches,\r\ntrunks, galley, heads and cabins were obviously required in a fighting\r\nship and can only be located on the theory that, when completed, the\r\n_Battery_ was a practical vessel.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the officers' cabins were over the race; the\r\nlogical place for the heads, galley, wardroom and mess also would be\r\nover the race, giving the remaining part of the gun deck for the\r\nnecessary hatches, ladderways, trunks, etc., in the two hulls, space\r\nrequired for armament, and to sling the hammocks of a watch below. As\r\nthe vessel was never fully manned, apparently, the space for hammocks is\r\nnot a serious problem in a reconstruction. If the vessel had been manned\r\nas proposed by 500 men, hammocks for over 200 would have been required,\r\nwhich would give very crowded quarters in view of the limited space\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThough no specific requirements were stated in the reports of the\r\ntrials, it seems reasonable to suppose that additional hatches were cut\r\nin the decks to improve the fireroom ventilation. In the reconstruction\r\ndrawings, these hatchways as well as the other deck openings and deck\r\nfittings--such as bilge pumps, companionways, skylights, binnacles,\r\nwheels and wheel-rope trunks, cable trunks, steampipe casings, and stack\r\nfiddleys--have been located in an effort to meet the imagined\r\nrequirements of the working of a ship of this unusual form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--MODEL OF _Steam Battery_ in the Museum of\r\nHistory and Technology. (Smithsonian photo 63990-E.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--LINES OF STEAMER _Congo_, built in 1815-1816\r\nfor the British Admiralty and converted to a sailing survey vessel. From\r\nAdmiralty Collection of Draughts, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.]\r\n\r\nThere are some unanswered questions that arose in the preparation of\r\nthe reconstruction drawings. As has been shown, the original inboard\r\narrangement plan found in Copenhagen shows four smokestacks, while\r\nMarestier's sketch of the vessel's boilers shows trunked flues\r\nindicating that two stacks were used. It is possible that the boilers\r\nwere first fitted so that four stacks were required; alterations made as\r\na result of steaming trials may well have included the introduction of\r\ntrunked flues and the final use of two stacks in line fore-and-aft. This\r\nwould have required a rearrangement of the fiddley hatches amidships.\r\n\r\nAnother troublesome question was the doubtful arrangement of the four\r\ncompanionways on the spar deck. Perhaps only two were fitted, one on\r\neach side of the officers' staterooms while the ladderways at the crew's\r\nend of the ship were simple ladder hatches.\r\n\r\nThe decision to use four bilge pumps is based upon the lack of drag in\r\nthe keel of the hulls, which would prevent accumulation of bilge water\r\nat one end of the hull. The use of four single-barrel pumps instead of\r\nfour double-barrel pumps may be questioned, for chain pumps requiring\r\ntwo barrels would have been practical.\r\n\r\nAllowance for stores was made by use of platforms in the hold. It is\r\nknown from statements made to the Court of Inquiry, that the magazines\r\nwere amidships and that a part of these was close to the boilers. Fuel\r\nand water would be in the lower hold under the platforms; hatches and\r\nladderways are arranged to permit fueling the ship.\r\n\r\nA few prints or drawings of the ship, aside from the patent drawing,\r\nhave been found. There are two prints that show the launch of the\r\nvessel. One, a print of 1815, is in possession of the Mariners' Museum,\r\nNewport News, Va., and is reproduced in Alexander Crosby Brown's _Twin\r\nShips, Notes on the Chronological History of the Use of Multiple Hulled\r\nVessels_.[20] A poor copy of this print appears on page 13 of Bennett's\r\n_Steam Navy of the United States_, and another and inaccurate sketch is\r\nshown on page 8. These pictures were of no use in the reconstruction as\r\nthey show no details that are not in the Copenhagen plans. The patent\r\ndrawing does not show deck details and in fact does not represent the\r\nvessel as built in any respect other than in being a catamaran with\r\npaddle wheel amidships between the hulls.\r\n\r\nThe _Steam Battery_ did not have any particular influence on the design\r\nof men-of-war that followed her. In the first place, steampower was not\r\nviewed with favor by naval officers generally. This was without doubt\r\ndue to prejudice, but engines in 1820-30 were still unreliable when\r\nrequired to run for long periods, as experienced by the early\r\nocean-going steamers. The great weight of the early steam engines and\r\ntheir size in relation to power were important, and also important were\r\npractical objections that prevented the design of efficient naval ocean\r\nsteamers until about 1840; even then, the paddle wheels made them very\r\nvulnerable in action. Until the introduction of the screw propellor it\r\nwas not possible to design a really effective ocean-going naval steamer;\r\nhence until about 1840-45, sail remained predominant in naval vessels\r\nfor ocean service, and steamers were accepted only in coast defense and\r\ntowing services, or as dispatch vessels.\r\n\r\nNo immediate use of the double hull in naval vessels of the maritime\r\npowers resulted from the construction of the _Steam Battery_. The\r\nflat-bottom chine-built design employed by Fulton in _North River_,\r\n_Raritan_, and other early steamboats was utilized in the design for a\r\nprojected steamer by the British Admiralty in 1815-16. This vessel was\r\nabout 76 feet overall, 16-foot beam, and 8-foot 10 inches depth in hold.\r\nHer design was for a flat-bottom, chine-built hull with no fore-and-aft\r\ncamber in the bottom, a sharp entrance, and a square-tuck stern with\r\nslight overhang above the cross-seam. Her side frames were straight and\r\nvertical amidships, but curved as the bow and stern were approached. She\r\nwas to be a side-paddle-wheel steamer, and her hull was diagonally\r\nbraced; the wheel and engine were to be about amidships where she was\r\ndead flat for about 14 feet. However, the engine and boilers were not\r\ninstalled; the engine was utilized ashore for pumping, and the vessel\r\nwas completed in the Deptford Yard as a sailing ship. Under the name\r\n_Congo_ she was employed in the African coast survey. Her plan is in the\r\nAdmiralty Collection of Draughts, at the National Maritime Museum,\r\nGreenwich, England.\r\n\r\nThe double hull continued to be employed in both steam and team\r\nferryboats in the United States and in England and France. A few river\r\nand lake steamers were also built with this design of hull. Continued\r\nefforts to obtain fast sailing by use of the double hull produced a\r\nnumber of sailing catamarans; of these the Herreshoff catamarans of the\r\n1870's showed high speed when reaching in a fresh breeze.\r\n\r\nDesigns for double-hulled steamers appeared during the last half of the\r\n19th century; in 1874 the _Castalia_, a large, double-hull, iron,\r\ncross-channel steamer, was built by the Thames Iron-works Company at\r\nBlackwall, England. She was 290 feet long, and each hull had a beam of\r\n17 feet. The paddle wheel was placed between the hulls and, ready for\r\nsea, she drew 6-1/2 feet. She ran the 22 miles between Dover and Calais\r\nin 1 hour and 50 minutes, a speed much slower than that of the\r\npaddle-wheel, cross-channel steamers having one hull. Another\r\ndouble-hull steamer was built for this service by Hawthorn, Leslie and\r\nCompany, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Scotland, in 1877. First named _Express_,\r\nshe was renamed _Calais-Douvres_ when she went into service in May 1878.\r\nHer length was 302 feet, her extreme beam 62 feet, and each hull had a\r\nbeam of 18 feet, 3 inches. She drew 6-foot 7-1/2 inches ready for sea\r\nand the paddle wheel was between the hulls. On her trials she made 14\r\nknots and burned coal excessively. Sold to France in 1880, she was taken\r\nout of service in 1889. Though popular, she was not faster than the\r\nsingle-hull steamers in this service and had been a comparatively\r\nexpensive vessel to build and operate.\r\n\r\nThe many attempts to produce a very fast double-hull steamer and large\r\nsailing vessels have led to disappointment for their designers and\r\nsponsors. In the history of naval architecture, since Petty's time,\r\nthere have been a number of periods when the new-old idea of the double\r\nhull has become popular. Craft of this type have been commonly well\r\npublicized but, on the whole, their basic designs have followed the same\r\nprinciples over and over again and have not produced the sought-for\r\nincrease in speed and handiness.\r\n\r\nIn very recent years there has been a revival in interest in sailing\r\ndouble-hull boats that is enthusiastic as to very small craft and\r\nsomewhat restrained as to large boats. A few projects are under\r\ndevelopment for double-hull craft, power and sail, of over 90-foot\r\nlength, including an oceanographic research vessel. In general, however,\r\nthe performance of double-hull boats has shown that Chapman's estimate\r\nof the type was reasonably correct and that there are limitations,\r\nparticularly in maneuverability in the double-hull craft that could have\r\nbeen found by reference to the history of past experiments with the\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVAL STEAMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOLOGOS; OR, FULTON THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year eighteen hundred and thirteen, Robert Fulton\r\nexhibited to the President of the United States, the original drawing\r\nfrom which the engraving on Plate One is sketched, being a\r\nrepresentation of the proposed war-steamer or floating-battery, named by\r\nhim, the Demologos. This sketch possesses more than ordinary interest,\r\nfrom the circumstance that it is, doubtless, the only record of the\r\n_first war-steamer in the world_, designed and drawn by the immortal\r\nFulton, and represented by him to the Executive, as capable of carrying\r\na strong battery, with furnaces for red hot shot, and being propelled by\r\nthe power of steam, at the rate of _four_ miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was contemplated that this vessel, besides carrying her proposed\r\narmament on deck, should also be furnished with submarine guns, two\r\nsuspended from each bow, so as to discharge a hundred pound ball into an\r\nenemy's ship at ten or twelve feet below her water-line. In addition to\r\nthis, her machinery was calculated for the addition of an engine which\r\nwould discharge an immense column of water upon the decks, and through\r\nthe port-holes of an enemy, making her the most formidable engine for\r\nwarfare that human ingenuity has contrived.\r\n\r\nThe estimated cost of the vessel was three hundred and twenty thousand\r\ndollars, nearly the sum requisite for a frigate of the first class.\r\n\r\nThe project was zealously embraced by the Executive, and the national\r\nlegislature in March, eighteen hundred and fourteen, passed a law,\r\nauthorizing the President of the United States to cause to be built,\r\nequipped, and employed, one or more floating batteries, for the defense\r\nof the waters of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe building of the vessel was committed by the Coast and Harbor Defense\r\nAssociation, to a sub-committee of five gentlemen, who were recognized\r\nby the Government as their agents for that purpose, and whose\r\ninteresting history of the Steam Frigate is copied in Note A, of the\r\nAppendix to this volume.\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton, whose soul animated the enterprise, was appointed the\r\nengineer; and on the twentieth day of June, eighteen hundred and\r\nfourteen, the keel of this novel steamer was laid at the ship-yard of\r\nAdam and Noah Brown, her able and active constructors, in the city of\r\nNew York, and on the twenty-ninth of the following October, or in little\r\nmore than four months, she was safely launched, in the presence of\r\nmultitudes of spectators who thronged the surrounding shores, and were\r\nseen upon the hills which limited the beautiful prospect around the bay\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nThe river and bay were filled with steamers and vessels of war, in\r\ncompliment to the occasion. In the midst of these was the enormous\r\nfloating mass, whose bulk and unwieldy form seemed to render her as\r\nunfit for motion, as the land batteries which were saluting her.\r\n\r\nIn a communication from Captain David Porter, U. S. Navy, to the Hon.\r\nSecretary of the Navy, dated New York, October 29, 1814, he states,--\"I\r\nhave the pleasure to inform you that the \"FULTON THE FIRST,\" was this\r\nmorning safely launched. No one has yet ventured to suggest any\r\nimprovement that could be made in the vessel, and to use the words of\r\nthe projector, '_I would not alter her if it were in my power to do\r\nso._'\r\n\r\n\"She promises fair to meet our most sanguine expectations, and I do not\r\ndespair in being able to navigate in her from one extreme of our coast\r\nto the other. Her buoyancy astonishes every one, she now draws _only\r\neight feet three inches water_, and her draft will only be _ten_ feet\r\nwith all her guns, machinery, stores, and crew, on board. The ease with\r\nwhich she can now be towed with a single steamboat, renders it certain\r\nthat her velocity will be sufficiently great to answer every purpose,\r\nand the manner it is intended to secure her machinery from the gunner's\r\nshot, leaves no apprehension for its safety. I shall use every exertion\r\nto prepare her for immediate service; her guns will soon be mounted, and\r\nI am assured by Mr. Fulton, that her machinery will be in operation in\r\nabout six weeks.\"\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of November, the Steam Frigate was moved from the\r\nwharf of Messrs. Browns, in the East River, to the works of Robert\r\nFulton, on the North River, to receive her machinery, which operation\r\nwas performed by fastening the steamboat \"Car of Neptune,\" to her\r\nlarboard, and the steamboat \"Fulton,\" to her starboard side; they towed\r\nher through the water from three and a-half to four miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the \"Fulton the First\" were:--\r\n\r\n     Length, one hundred and fifty-six feet.\r\n\r\n     Breadth, fifty-six feet.\r\n\r\n     Depth, twenty feet.\r\n\r\n     Water-wheel, sixteen feet diameter.\r\n\r\n     Length of bucket, fourteen feet.\r\n\r\n     Dip, four feet.\r\n\r\n     Engine, forty-eight inch cylinder, and five feet stroke.\r\n\r\n     Boiler, length, twenty-two feet; breath, twelve feet; and depth,\r\n     eight feet.\r\n\r\n     Tonnage, two thousand four hundred and seventy-five.\r\n\r\nBy June, eighteen hundred and fifteen, her engine was put on board, and\r\nshe was so far completed as to afford an opportunity of trying her\r\nmachinery. On the first of June, at ten o'clock in the morning, the\r\n\"Fulton the First,\" propelled by her own steam and machinery, left the\r\nwharf near the Brooklyn ferry, and proceeded majestically into the\r\nriver; though a stiff breeze from the south blew directly ahead, she\r\nstemmed the current with perfect ease, as the tide was a strong ebb. She\r\nsailed by the forts and saluted them with her thirty-two pound guns. Her\r\nspeed was equal to the most sanguine expectations; she exhibited a novel\r\nand sublime spectacle to an admiring people. The intention of the\r\nCommissioners being solely to try her enginery, no use was made of her\r\nsails. After navigating the bay, and receiving a visit from the officers\r\nof the French ship of war lying at her anchors, the Steam Frigate came\r\nto at Powles' Hook ferry, about two o'clock in the afternoon, without\r\nhaving experienced a single unpleasant occurrence.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of July, of the same year, she made a passage to the ocean\r\nand back, and went the distance, which, in going and returning, is\r\nfifty-three miles, in eight hours and twenty minutes, without the aid of\r\nsails; the wind and tide were partly in her favor and partly against\r\nher, the balance rather in her favor.\r\n\r\nIn September, she made another trial trip to the ocean, and having at\r\nthis time the weight of her whole armament on board, she went at an\r\naverage of five and a half miles an hour, with and against the tide.\r\nWhen stemming the tide, which ran at the rate of three miles an hour,\r\nshe advanced at the rate of two and a-half miles an hour. This\r\nperformance was not more than equal to Robert Fulton's expectations, but\r\nit exceeded what he had premised to the Government, which was that she\r\nshould be propelled by steam at the rate of from three to four miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe English were not uninformed as to the preparations which were\r\nmaking for them, nor inattentive to their progress. It is certain that\r\nthe Steam Frigate lost none of her terrors in the reports or\r\nimaginations of the enemy. In a treatise on steam vessels, published in\r\nScotland at that time, the author states that he has taken great care to\r\nprocure _full_ and _accurate_ information of the Steam Frigate launched\r\nin New York, and which he describes in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"Length on deck, _three hundred feet_; breadth, _two hundred feet_;\r\nthickness of her sides, _thirteen feet_ of alternate oak plank and cork\r\nwood--carries forty-four guns, four of which are _hundred pounders_;\r\nquarter-deck and forecastle guns, forty-four pounders; and further to\r\nannoy an enemy attempting to board, can discharge _one hundred gallons\r\nof boiling water in a minute_, and by mechanism, brandishes _three\r\nhundred cutlasses_ with the utmost regularity over her gunwales; works\r\nalso an equal number of heavy iron pikes of great length, darting them\r\nfrom her sides with prodigious force, and withdrawing them every quarter\r\nof a minute\"!!\r\n\r\nThe war having terminated before the \"_Fulton the First_\" was entirely\r\ncompleted, she was taken to the Navy Yard, Brooklyn, and moored on the\r\nflats abreast of that station, where she remained, and was used as a\r\nreceiving-ship until the fourth of June, eighteen hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine, when she was blown up. The following letters from Commodore\r\nIsaac Chauncey (then Commandant of the New York Navy Yard) to the\r\nHonorable Secretary of the Navy, informing him of the distressing event,\r\nconcludes this brief history of the _first steam vessel of war ever\r\nbuilt_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nU. S. NAVY YARD, NEW YORK,\r\n_June 5th, 1829_.\r\n\r\nSIR:\r\n\r\nIt becomes my painful duty to report to you a most unfortunate\r\noccurrence which took place yesterday, at about half past two o'clock,\r\nP. M., in the accidental blowing up of the Receiving Ship Fulton, which\r\nkilled twenty-four men and a woman, and wounded nineteen; there are also\r\nfive missing. Amongst the killed I am sorry to number Lieutenant S. M.\r\nBrackenridge, a very fine, promising officer, and amongst the wounded\r\nare, Lieutenants Charles F. Platt, and A. M. Mull, and Sailing-Master\r\nClough, the former dangerously, and the two last severely; there are\r\nalso four Midshipmen severely wounded. How this unfortunate accident\r\noccurred I am not yet able to inform you, nor have I time to state more\r\nparticularly; I will, as soon as possible, give a detailed account of\r\nthe affair.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n  Very respectfully,\r\n    J. CHAUNCEY.\r\n\r\nHON. JOHN BRANCH,\r\n  _Secretary of the Navy, Washington._\r\n\r\nU.S. NAVY YARD, NEW YORK,\r\n_June 8th, 1829_.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI had been on board the \"Fulton\" all the morning, inspecting the ship\r\nand men, particularly the sick and invalids, which had increased\r\nconsiderably from other ships, and whom I had intended to ask the\r\nDepartment permission to discharge, as being of little use to the\r\nservice. I had left the ship but a few moments before the explosion took\r\nplace, and was in my office at the time. The report did not appear to me\r\nlouder than a thirty-two pounder, although the destruction of the ship\r\nwas complete and entire, owing to her very decayed state, for there was\r\nnot on board, at the time, more than two and a-half barrels of damaged\r\npowder, which was kept in the magazine for the purpose of firing the\r\nmorning and evening gun. It appears to me that the explosion could not\r\nhave taken place from accident, as the magazine was as well, or better\r\nsecured, than the magazines of most of our ships, yet it would be\r\ndifficult to assign a motive to those in the magazine for so horrible an\r\nact, as voluntarily to destroy themselves and those on board. If the\r\nexplosion was not the effect of design, I am at a loss to account for\r\nthe catastrophe.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n  Very respectfully,\r\n    J. CHAUNCEY.\r\n\r\nHON. JOHN BRANCH,\r\n  _Secretary of the Navy, Washington_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\nSTEAM FRIGATE.\r\n\r\n_Report of HENRY RUTGERS, SAMUEL L. MITCHEL, and THOMAS MORRIS, the\r\nCommissioners superintending the construction of a steam vessel of war,\r\nto the Secretary of the Navy._\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _December 28th, 1815_.\r\n\r\nSIR:\r\n\r\nThe war which was terminated by the treaty of Ghent, afforded, during\r\nits short continuance, a glorious display of the valor of the United\r\nStates by land and by sea--it made them much better known to foreign\r\nnations, and, what is of much greater importance, it contributed to make\r\nthem better acquainted with themselves--it excited new enterprises--it\r\neduced latent talents--it stimulated to exertions unknown to our people\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nA long extent of coast was exposed to an enemy, powerful above every\r\nother on the ocean. His commanders threatened to lay waste our country\r\nwith fire and sword, and, actually, in various instances, carried their\r\nmenaces into execution. It became necessary, for our defense, to resist,\r\nby every practicable method, such a formidable foe.\r\n\r\nIt was conceived, by a most ingenious and enterprising citizen, that\r\nthe power of Steam could be employed to propel a floating battery,\r\ncarrying heavy guns, to the destruction of any hostile force that should\r\nhover on the shores, or enter the ports of our Atlantic frontier. The\r\nperfect and admirable success of his project for moving boats containing\r\ntravelers and baggage by the same elastic agent, opened the way to its\r\nemployment for carrying warriors and the apparatus for fighting.\r\n\r\nThe plan was submitted to the consideration of the executive of an\r\nenlightened government. Congress, influenced by the most liberal and\r\npatriotic spirit, appropriated money for the experiment, and the Navy\r\nDepartment, then conducted by the honorable William Jones, appointed\r\ncommissioners to superintend the construction of a convenient vessel\r\nunder the direction of ROBERT FULTON, the inventor, as engineer, and\r\nMessrs. Adam and Noah Brown, as naval constructors. The enterprise, from\r\nits commencement, and during a considerable part of its preparatory\r\noperations, was aided by the zealous co-operation of Major General\r\nDearborn, then holding his head-quarters at the city of New York, as the\r\nofficer commanding the third military district. The loss of his valuable\r\ncounsel in conducting a work which he had maturely considered, and which\r\nhe strongly recommended, was the consequence of his removal to another\r\nsection of the Union, where his professional talents were specially\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe keels of this steam-frigate were laid on the twentieth day of June,\r\neighteen hundred and fourteen. The strictest blockade the enemy could\r\nenforce interrupted the coasting trade, and greatly enhanced the price\r\nof timber. The vigilance with which he guarded our coast against\r\nintercourse with foreign nations, rendered difficult the importation of\r\ncopper and iron. The same impediment attended the supplies of coal\r\nheretofore brought to New York from Richmond and Liverpool. Lead, in\r\nlike manner, was procured under additional disadvantages. These attempts\r\nof the enemy to frustrate the design, were vain and impotent. All the\r\nobstacles were surmounted. Scarcity of the necessary woods and metals\r\nwere overcome by strenuous exertions; and all the blockading squadron\r\ncould achieve, was not a disappointment in the undertaking, but merely\r\nan increase of the expense.\r\n\r\nSo, in respect to tradesmen and laborers, there was an extraordinary\r\ndifficulty. Shipwrights had repaired to the lakes, for repelling the\r\nenemy, in such numbers, that, comparatively speaking, few were left on\r\nthe seaboard. A large portion of the men who had been engaged in daily\r\nwork, had enlisted as soldiers, and had marched under the banners of the\r\nnation to the defense of its rights--yet amidst the scarcity of hands, a\r\nsufficient number were procured for the purpose which the Commissioners\r\nhad in charge. An increase of wages was the chief impediment, and this\r\nthey were enabled practically to overcome.\r\n\r\nBy the exemplary combination of diligence and skill, on the part of the\r\nEngineer and Constructors, the business was so accelerated, that the\r\nvessel was launched on the twenty-ninth day of October, amidst the\r\nplaudits of an unusual number of citizens.\r\n\r\nMeasures were immediately taken to complete her equipment; the boiler,\r\nthe engine, and the machinery were put on board with all possible\r\nexpedition. Their weight and size far surpassed any thing that had been\r\nwitnessed before among us.\r\n\r\nThe stores of artillery in New York not furnishing the number and kind\r\nof cannon which she was destined to carry, it became necessary to\r\ntransport guns from Philadelphia. A prize, taken from the enemy, put\r\nsome fit and excellent pieces at the disposal of the Navy Department. To\r\navoid the danger of capture by the enemy's cruisers, these were carted\r\nover the miry roads of New Jersey. Twenty heavy cannon were thus\r\nconveyed by the strength of horses. Carriages of the most approved model\r\nwere constructed, and every thing done to bring her into prompt action,\r\nas an efficient instrument of war.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, an officer, pre-eminent for bravery and discipline,\r\nwas commissioned by the government to her command. Prior to this event,\r\nit had been intended by the Commissioners to finish her conformably to\r\nthe plan originally submitted to the Executive. She is a structure\r\nresting upon two boats and keels, separated from end to end by a canal\r\nfifteen feet wide, and sixty-six long. One boat contained the caldrons\r\nof copper to prepare her steam. The vast cylinder of iron, with its\r\npiston, levers, and wheels, occupied a part of its fellow; the great\r\nwater-wheel revolved in the space between them; the main or gun-deck\r\nsupported her armament, and was protected by a bulwark four feet ten\r\ninches thick, of solid timber. This was pierced by thirty port-holes, to\r\nenable as many thirty-two pounders to fire red hot balls; her upper or\r\nspar deck was plain, and she was to be propelled by her enginery alone.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Captain Porter and Mr. Fulton, that the upper deck\r\nought to be surrounded with a bulwark and stanchions--that two stout\r\nmasts should be erected to support latteen sails--that there should be\r\nbowsprits for jibs, and that she should be rigged in a corresponding\r\nstyle. Under authorities so great, and with the expectation of being\r\nable to raise the blockade of New London, by destroying, taking, or\r\nrouting the enemy's ships, all these additions were adopted and\r\nincorporated with the vessel.\r\n\r\nIt must here be observed, that during the exhaustion of the treasury,\r\nand the temporary depression of public credit, the Commissioners were\r\nexceedingly embarrassed--their payments were made in treasury notes,\r\nwhich they were positively instructed to negotiate at par. On several\r\noccasions even these were so long withheld, that the persons who had\r\nadvanced materials and labor were importunate for payment, and silently\r\ndiscontented. To a certain extent, the Commissioners pledged their\r\nprivate credit. Notwithstanding all this, the men, at one time, actually\r\nbroke off. The work was retarded, and her completion unavoidably\r\ndeferred, to the great disappointment of the Commissioners, until winter\r\nrendered it impossible for her to act.\r\n\r\nUnder all this pressure, they, nevertheless, persevered in the important\r\nobject confided to them. But their exertions were further retarded by\r\nthe premature and unexpected death of the Engineer. The world was\r\ndeprived of his invaluable labors before he had completed this favorite\r\nundertaking. They will not inquire, wherefore, in the dispensations of\r\nDivine Providence, he was not permitted to realize his grand conception.\r\n_His discoveries, however, survive for the benefit of mankind_, and will\r\nextend to unborn generations.\r\n\r\nAt length all matters were ready for a trial of the machinery to urge\r\nsuch a bulky vessel through the water. This essay was made on the first\r\nday of June, eighteen hundred and fifteen. She proved herself capable of\r\nopposing the wind, and of stemming the tide, of crossing currents, and\r\nof being steered among vessels riding at anchor, though the weather was\r\nboisterous and the water rough. Her performance demonstrated that the\r\nproject was successful--no doubt remained that a floating battery,\r\ncomposed of heavy artillery, could be moved by steam. The Commissioners\r\nreturned from the exercise of the day, satisfied that the vessel would\r\nanswer the intended purpose, and consoled themselves that their care had\r\nbeen bestowed upon a worthy object.\r\n\r\nBut it was discovered, that various alterations were necessary. Guided\r\nby the light of experience, they caused some errors to be corrected, and\r\nsome defects to be supplied. She was prepared for a second voyage with\r\nall practicable speed.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of July she was again put in action. She performed a trip\r\nto the ocean, eastward of Sandy Hook, and back again, a distance of\r\nfifty-three miles, in eight hours and twenty minutes. A part of this\r\ntime she had the tide against her, and had no assistance whatever from\r\nsails. Of the gentlemen who formed the company invited to witness the\r\nexperiment, not one entertained a doubt of her fitness for the intended\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAdditional expedients were, notwithstanding, necessary to be sought for\r\nquickening and directing her motion. These were devised and executed\r\nwith all possible care.\r\n\r\nSuitable arrangements having been made, a third trial of her powers was\r\nattempted on the eleventh day of September, with the weight of\r\ntwenty-six of her long and ponderous guns, and a considerable quantity\r\nof ammunition and stores on board; her draft of water was short of\r\neleven feet. She changed her course by inverting the motion of the\r\nwheel, without the necessity of putting about. She fired salutes as she\r\npassed the forts, and she overcame the resistance of the wind and tide\r\nin her progress down the bay. She performed beautiful man[oe]uvres\r\naround the United States' Frigate JAVA, then at anchor near the\r\nlight-house. She moved with remarkable celerity, and she was perfectly\r\nobedient to her double helm. It was observed that the explosion of\r\npowder produced very little concussion. The machinery was not affected\r\nby it in the smallest degree. Her progress, during the firing, was\r\nsteady and uninterrupted. On the most accurate calculations, derived\r\nfrom heaving the log, her average velocity was five and a-half miles per\r\nhour. Notwithstanding the resistance of currents, she was found to make\r\nheadway at the rate of two miles an hour against the ebb of the East\r\nRiver, running three and a-half knots. The day's exercise was\r\nsatisfactory to the respectable company who attended, beyond their\r\nutmost expectations. It was universally agreed that we now possessed a\r\nnew auxiliary against every maratime invader. The City of New York,\r\nexposed as it is, was considered as having the means of rendering itself\r\ninvulnerable. The Delaware, Chesapeake, Long Island Sound, and every\r\nother bay and harbor in the nation, may be protected by the same\r\ntremendous power.\r\n\r\nAmong the inconveniences observable during the experiment, was the heat\r\nendured by the men who attended the fires. To enable a correct judgment\r\nto be formed on this point, one of the Commissioners (Dr. Mitchel)\r\ndescended and examined, by a thermometer, the temperature of the hold,\r\nbetween the two boilers. The quicksilver, exposed to the radiant heat of\r\nthe burning fuel, rose to one hundred and sixteen degrees of\r\nFahrenheit's scale. Though exposed thus to its intensity, he experienced\r\nno indisposition afterwards. The analogy of potteries, forges,\r\nglass-houses, kitchens, and other places, where laborers are habitually\r\nexposed to high heats, is familiar to persons of business and of\r\nreflection. In all such occupations, the men, by proper relays, perform\r\ntheir services perfectly well.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, will understand that the hold of the present\r\nvessel could be rendered cooler by other apertures for the admission of\r\nair, and that on building another steam frigate, the comfort of the\r\nfiremen might be provided for, as in the ordinary steamboats.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners congratulate the Government and the nation on the\r\nevent of this noble project. Honorable alike, to its author and its\r\npatrons, it constitutes an era in warfare and the arts. The arrival of\r\npeace, indeed, has disappointed the expectations of conducting her to\r\nbattle. That last and conclusive act of showing her superiority in\r\ncombat, has not been in the power of the Commissioners to make.\r\n\r\nIf a continuance of tranquillity should be our lot, and this steam\r\nvessel of war be not required for the public defense, the nation may\r\nrejoice that the fact we have ascertained is of incalculably greater\r\nvalue than the expenditure--and that if the present structure should\r\nperish, we have the information never to perish, how, on a future\r\nemergency, others may be built. The requisite variations will be\r\ndictated by circumstances.\r\n\r\nOwing to the cessation of hostilities, it has been deemed inexpedient to\r\nfinish and equip her as for immediate and active employ. In a few weeks\r\nevery thing that is incomplete could receive the proper adjustment.\r\n\r\nAfter so much has been done, and with such encouraging results, it\r\nbecomes the Commissioners to recommend that the steam frigate be\r\nofficered and manned for discipline and practice. A discreet commander,\r\nwith a selected crew, could acquire experience in the mode of navigating\r\nthis peculiar vessel. The supplies of fuel, the tending of the fire, the\r\nreplenishing of the expended water, the management of the mechanism, the\r\nheating of shot, the exercise of the guns, and various matters, can only\r\nbecome familiar by use. It is highly important that a portion of seamen\r\nand marines should be versed in the order and economy of the steam\r\nfrigate. They will augment, diffuse, and perpetuate knowledge. When, in\r\nprocess of time, another war shall call for more structures of this\r\nkind, men, regularly trained to her tactics, may be dispatched to the\r\nseveral stations where they may be wanted. If, on any such disposition,\r\nthe Government should desire a good and faithful agent, the\r\nCommissioners recommend Captain Obed Smith to notice, as a person who\r\nhas ably performed the duties of inspector from the beginning to the end\r\nof the concern.\r\n\r\nAnnexed to the report, you will find, Sir, several statements\r\nexplanatory of the subject. A separate report of our colleague, the\r\nhonorable Oliver Wolcott, whose removal from New York precluded him from\r\nattending to the latter part of the business, with his accustomed zeal\r\nand fidelity, is herewith presented. A drawing of her form and\r\nappearance, by Mr. Morgan, as being like to give satisfaction to the\r\ndepartment, is also subjoined, as are likewise an inventory of her\r\nfurniture and effects, and an account of the timber and metals\r\nconsolidated in her fabric.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped these communications will evince the pains taken by the\r\nCommissioners, to execute the honorable and responsible trust reposed in\r\nthem by the Government.\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL L.

During the intervening three centuries\r\n     numerous other chemical miracles have been found, yet\r\n     phosphorus retains a special aura of universal importance in\r\n     chemistry. Many investigators have occupied themselves with\r\n     this element and its diverse chemical compounds. Further\r\n     enlightenment and insight into the ways of nature can be\r\n     expected from these efforts._\r\n\r\n     _Not only is the story of phosphorus a major drama in the\r\n     history of chemistry; it also illustrates, in a spectacular\r\n     example, the growth of this science through the discovery of\r\n     connections between apparently unrelated phenomena, and the\r\n     continuous interplay between basic science and the search for\r\n     practical usage._\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR: _Eduard Farber is a research professor at American\r\n     University, Washington, D.C., and has been associated with the\r\n     Smithsonian Institution as a consultant in chemistry._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen phosphorus was discovered, nearly three centuries ago, it was\r\nconsidered a miraculous thing. The only event that provoked a similar\r\nemotion was the discovery of radium more than two centuries later. The\r\nexcitement about the _Phosphorus igneus_, Boyle's _Icy Noctiluca_, was\r\nslowly replaced by, or converted into, chemical research. Yet, if we\r\nwould allow room for emotion in research, we could still be excited\r\nabout the wondrous substance that chemical and biological work continues\r\nto reveal as vitally important. It is a fundamental plant nutrient, an\r\nessential part in nerve and brain substance, a decisive factor in muscle\r\naction and cell growth, and also a component in fast-acting, powerful\r\npoisons. The importance of phosphorus was gradually recognized and the\r\nmeans by which this took place are characteristic and similar to other\r\ndevelopments in the history of science. This paper was written in order\r\nto summarize these various means which led to the highly complex ways of\r\npresent research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Element from Animals and Plants\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a little late to search for the philosophers' stone in 1669, yet\r\nit was in such a search that phosphorus was discovered. Wilhelm Homberg\r\n(1652-1715) described it in the following manner: Brand, \"a man little\r\nknown, of low birth, with a bizarre and mysterious nature in all he\r\ndid, found this luminous matter while searching for something else. He\r\nwas a glassmaker by profession, but he had abandoned it in order to be\r\nfree for the pursuit of the philosophical stone with which he was\r\nengrossed. Having put it into his mind that the secret of the\r\nphilosophical stone consisted in the preparation of urine, this man\r\nworked in all kinds of manners and for a very long time without finding\r\nanything. Finally, in the year 1669, after a strong distillation of\r\nurine, he found in the recipient a luminant matter that has since been\r\ncalled phosphorus. He showed it to some of his friends, among them\r\nMister Kunkel [sic].\"[1]\r\n\r\nNeither the name nor the phenomenon were really new. Organic\r\nphosphorescent materials were known to Aristotle, and a lithophosphorus\r\nwas the subject of a book published in 1640, based on a discovery made\r\nby a shoemaker, Vicenzo Casciarolo, on a mountain-side near Bologna in\r\n1630.[2] Was the substance new which Brand showed to his friends? Johann\r\nGottfried Leonhardi quotes a book of 1689 in which the author, Kletwich,\r\nclaims that this phosphorus had already been known to Fernelius, the\r\ncourt physician of King Henri II of France (1154-1189).[3] To the same\r\nperiod belongs the \"Ordinatio Alchid Bechil Saraceni philosophi,\" in\r\nwhich Ferdinand Hoefer found a distillation of urine with clay and\r\ncarbonaceous material described, and the resulting product named\r\nescarbuncle.[4] It would be worth looking for this source; although\r\nBechil would still remain an entirely unsuccessful predecessor, it does\r\nseem strange that in all the distillations of arbitrary mixtures, the\r\nconditions should never before 1669 have been right for the formation\r\nand the observation of phosphorus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--THE ALCHEMIST DISCOVERS PHOSPHORUS. A painting\r\nby Joseph Wright (1734-1779) of Derby, England.]\r\n\r\nFor Brand's contemporaries at least, the discovery was new and exciting.\r\nThe philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716) considered it\r\nimportant enough to devote some of his time (between his work as\r\nlibrarian in Hanover and Wolfenbüttel, his efforts to reunite the\r\nProtestant and the Catholic churches, and his duties as Privy Councellor\r\nin what we would call a Department of Justice) to a history of\r\nphosphorus. This friend of Huygens and Boyle tried to prove that Kunckel\r\nwas not justified in claiming the discovery for himself.[5] Since then,\r\nit has been shown that Johann Kunckel (1630-1703) actually worked out\r\nthe method which neither Brand nor his friend Kraft wanted to disclose.\r\nBoyle also developed a method independently, published it, and\r\ninstructed Gottfried Hankwitz in the technique. Later on, Jean Hellot\r\n(1685-1765) gave a meticulous description of the details and a long\r\nsurvey of the literature.[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--GALLEY-OVEN, 1869. The picture is a cross\r\nsection through the front of the oven showing one of the 36 retorts, the\r\nreceivers for the distillate, and the space in the upper story used for\r\nevaporating the mixture of acid solution of calcium phosphate and coal.\r\n(According to ANSELME PAYEN, _Précis de Chimie industrielle_, Paris,\r\n1849; reproduced from HUGO FLECK, _Die Fabrikation chemischer Produkte\r\naus thierischen Abfällen_, Vieweg, Braunschweig, 1862, page 80 of volume\r\n2, 2nd group, of P. BOLLEY'S _Handbuch der chemischen Technologie_.)]\r\n\r\nTo obtain phosphorus, a good proportion of coal (regarded as a type of\r\nphlogiston) was added to urine, previously thickened by evaporation and\r\npreferably after putrefaction, and the mixture was heated to the highest\r\nattainable temperature. It was obvious that phlogiston entered into the\r\ncomposition of the distillation product. The question remained whether\r\nthis product was generated _de novo_. In his research of 1743 to 1746,\r\nAndreas Sigismund Marggraf (1709-1782) provided the answer. He found the\r\nnew substance in edible plant seeds, and he concluded that it enters the\r\nhuman system through the plant food, to be excreted later in the urine.\r\nHe did not convince all the chemists with his reasoning. In 1789,\r\nMacquer wrote: \"There are some who, even at this time, hold that the\r\nphosphorical ('phosphorische') acid generates itself in the animals and\r\nwho consider this to be the 'animalistic acid.'\"[7]\r\n\r\nAlthough Marggraf was more advanced in his arguments than these\r\nchemists, yet he was a child of his time. The luminescent and\r\ncombustible, almost wax-like substance impressed him greatly. \"My\r\nthoughts about the unexpected generation of light and fire out of water,\r\nfine earth, and phlogiston I reserve to describe at a later time.\" These\r\nthoughts went so far as to connect the new marvel with alchemical wonder\r\ntales. When Marggraf used the \"essential salt of urine,\" also called\r\n_sal microcosmicum_, and admixed silver chloride (\"horny silver\") to it\r\nfor the distillation of phosphorus, he expected \"a partial conversion of\r\nsilver by phlogiston and the added fine vitrifiable earth, but no trace\r\nof a more noble metal appeared.\"[8]\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle had already found that the burning of phosphorus produced\r\nan acid. He identified it by taste and by its influence on colored plant\r\nextracts serving as \"indicators.\" Hankwitz[9] described methods for\r\nobtaining this acid, and Marggraf showed its chemical peculiarities.\r\nThey did not necessarily establish phosphorus as a new element. To do\r\nthat was not as important, at that time, as to conjecture on analogies\r\nwith known substances. Underlying all its unique characteristics was the\r\nanalogy of phosphorus with sulfur. Like sulfur, phosphorus can burn in\r\ntwo different ways, either slowly or more violently, and form two\r\ndifferent acids. The analogy can, therefore, be extended to explain the\r\nresults in both groups in the same way. In the process of burning, the\r\ncombustible component is removed, and the acid originally combined with\r\nthe combustible is set free. Whether the analogy should be pursued even\r\nfurther remained doubtful, although some suspicion lingered on for a\r\nwhile that phosphoric acid might actually be a modified sulfuric acid.\r\nAnalogies and suspicions like these were needed to formulate new\r\nquestions and stimulate new experiments. They are cited here for their\r\nimportant positive value in the historical development, and not for the\r\npurpose of showing how wrong these chemists were from our point of\r\nview, a point of view which they helped to create.\r\n\r\nThe widespread interest in the burning of sulfur and of phosphorus,\r\nnaturally, caught Lavoisier's attention. In his first volume of\r\n_Opuscules Physiques et Chimiques_ (1774), he devoted 20 pages to his\r\nexperiments on phosphorus. He amplified them a few years later[10] when\r\nhe attributed the combustion to a combination of phosphorus with the\r\n\"eminently respirable\" part of air. In the _Méthode de Nomenclature\r\nChimique_ of 1787, the column of \"undecomposed substances\" lists sulfur\r\nas the \"radical sulfurique,\" and phosphorus, correspondingly, as the\r\n\"radical phosphorique.\" The acids are now shown to be compounds of the\r\n\"undecomposed\" radicals, the complete reversion of the previous concept\r\nof this relationship. A part of the old analogy remained as far as the\r\nacids are concerned: sulfuric acid corresponds to phosphoric; sulfurous\r\nacid to phosphorous acid with less oxygen than in the former.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Uses\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century, phosphorus was a costly material. It was produced\r\nmostly for display and to satisfy curiosity. Guillaume François Rouelle\r\n(1703-1770) demonstrated the process in his lectures, and, as Macquer\r\nreports, he \"very often\" succeeded in making it.[12] Robert Boyle had\r\nthe idea of using phosphorus as a light for underwater divers.[13] A\r\ncentury later, \"instant lights\" were sold, with molten phosphorus as the\r\n\"igniter,\" but they proved cumbersome and unreliable.[14] Because white\r\nphosphorus is highly poisonous, an active development of the use in\r\nmatches occurred only after the conversion of the white modification\r\ninto the red had been studied by Émile Kopp (1844), by Wilhelm Hittorf\r\n(1824-1914) and, in its practical application, by Anton Schrötter\r\n(1802-1875).[15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--DISTILLATION APPARATUS (1849) for refining\r\ncrude phosphorus. The crude phosphorus is mixed with sand under hot\r\nwater, cooled, drained, and filled into the retort. The outlet of the\r\nretort, at least 6 cm. in diameter, is partially immersed in the water\r\ncontained in the bucket. A small dish, made from lead, with an iron\r\nhandle, receives the distilled phosphorus. (From HUGO FLECK, _Die\r\nFabrikation chemischer Produkte ..._ page 90.)]\r\n\r\nThe most exciting early use, however, was in medicine. It is not\r\nsurprising that such a use was sought at that time. Any new material\r\nimmediately became the hope of ailing mankind--and of striving\r\ninventors.[16] Phosphorus was prescribed, in liniments with fatty oils\r\nor as solution in alcohol and ether, for external and internal\r\napplication. A certain Dr. Kramer found it efficient against epilepsy\r\nand melancholia (1730). A Professor Hartmann recommended it against\r\ncramps.[17] However, in the growing production of phosphorus for\r\nmatches, the workers experienced the poisonous effects. In the plant of\r\nBlack and Bell at Stratford, this was prevented by inhaling turpentine.\r\nExperiments on dogs were carried out to show that poisoning by\r\nphosphorus could be remedied through oil of turpentine.[18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--APPARATUS FOR CONVERTING WHITE PHOSPHORUS into\r\nthe red allotropic form, 1851. Redistilled phosphorus is heated in the\r\nglass or porcelain vessel (g) which is surrounded by a sandbath (e) and\r\na metal bath (b). Vessel (j) is filled with mercury and water; together\r\nwith valve (k), it serves as a safety device. The alcohol lamp (l) keeps\r\nthe tube warm against clogging by solidified vapors. Because of hydrogen\r\nphosphides, the operation, carried out at 260° C., had to be watched\r\nvery carefully. (According to Arthur Albright, 1851; reproduced from\r\nHUGO FLECK, _Die Fabrikation chemischer Produkte ..._, page 112.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical Constitution of Phosphoric Acids\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a long article on phosphorus, Edmond Willm wrote in 1876: \"For a\r\ncentury, urine was the only source from which phosphorus was obtained.\r\nAfter Gahn, in 1769, recognized the presence of phosphoric acid in\r\nbones, Scheele indicated the procedure for making phosphorus from\r\nthem.\"[19] Actually, Gahn used at first hartshorn (_Cornu cervi\r\nustum_), and Scheele doubted, until he checked it himself, that his\r\nesteemed friend was right. A few years later, Scheele corrected Gahn's\r\nassumption that the _sal microcosmicum_ was an ammonia salt; instead, it\r\nis \"a tertiary neutral salt, consisting of _alkali minerali fixo_ (i.e.,\r\nsodium), _alkali volatili_, and _acido phosphori_.\"[20]\r\n\r\nIn the years after 1770, phosphorus was discovered in bones and many\r\nother parts of various animals. Treatment with sulfuric acid decomposed\r\nthese materials into a solid residue and dissolved phosphoric acid. Many\r\nsalts of this acid were produced in crystalline form. Heat resistance\r\nhad been considered one of the outstanding characteristics of phosphoric\r\nacid. Now, however, in the processes of drying and heating certain\r\nphosphates, it became clear that three kinds of phosphoric acids could\r\nbe produced: _ortho_, _pyro_, and _meta_.\r\n\r\nBerzelius cited these acids as examples of compounds which are ISOMERIC.\r\nThis word was intended to designate compounds which contain the same\r\nnumber of atoms of the same elements but combined in different manners,\r\nthereby explaining their different chemical properties and crystal\r\nforms. It was in 1830 that Berzelius propounded this companion of the\r\nconcept, ISOMORPHISM, which was to collect all cases of equal crystal\r\nform in compounds in which equal numbers of atoms of different elements\r\nare put together in the same manner. Together, the two concepts of\r\nisomerism and isomorphism seemed to cover all the known exceptions from\r\nthe simplest assumption as to specificity and chemical composition.\r\n\r\nHowever, only a few years later Thomas Graham (1805-1869) proved that\r\nthe three phosphoric acids are not isomeric. He used the proportion of 2\r\nP to 5 O in the oxide which Berzelius had thought justified at least\r\nuntil \"an example of the contrary could be sufficiently\r\nestablished.\"[21] Refining the techniques of Gay-Lussac (1816) and\r\nseveral other investigators, Graham characterized the three phosphoric\r\nacids as \"a terphosphate, a biphosphate, and phosphate of water.\"\r\nActually, this was the wrong terminology for what he meant and\r\nformulated as trihydrate, bihydrate, and monohydrate of phosphorus\r\noxide. In his manner of writing the formulas, each dot over the symbol\r\nfor the element was to indicate an atom of oxygen; thus, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    ...   :: ..   ...    . .\r\n    H^{3} P  H^{2} P and H P.[22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--OVEN FOR THE CALCINATION OF BONES, about 1870.\r\n\"The operation is carried out in a rather high oven, such as shown....\r\nThe fresh bones are thrown in at the top of the oven, B. First, fuel in\r\nchamber F is lighted, and a certain quantity of bones is burnt on the\r\ngrid D. When these bones are burning well, the oven is gradually filled\r\nwith bones, and the combustion maintains itself without addition of\r\nother fuel. A circular gallery, C, surrounds the bottom of the oven and\r\ncarries the products of combustion into the chimney, H. The calcined\r\nbones are taken out at the lower opening, G, by removing the bars of\r\ngrid B.\" (Translation of the description from FIGUIER, _Merveilles de\r\nl'industrie_, volume 3, 1874, page 537.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--AN ADVERTISEMENT with view of plant for\r\nmanufacturing superphosphate about 1867. (From E. T. FREEDLEY,\r\n_Philadelphia and its Manufacturers in 1867_, page 288.)]\r\n\r\nGraham had come to this understanding of the phosphoric acids through\r\nhis previous studies of \"Alcoates, definite compounds of Salts and\r\nAlcohol analogous to the Hydrates\" (1831). Liebig started from analogies\r\nhe saw with certain organic acids when he formulated the phosphoric\r\nacids with a constant proportion of water (aq.) and varying proportions\r\nof \"phosphoric acid\" (P) as follows:\r\n\r\n    2 P 3 aq.  phosphoric acid\r\n    3 P 3 aq.  pyrophosphoric acid\r\n    6 P 3 aq.  metaphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--FLORIDA HARD-ROCK PHOSPHATE MINING. (From\r\nCarroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States_, sixth\r\nspecial report of the Commissioner of Labor, Government Printing Office,\r\nWashington, 1893, plate facing page 43.)]\r\n\r\nSalts are formed when a \"basis,\" i.e., a metal oxide, replaces water.\r\nWhen potassium-acid sulfate is neutralized by sodium base, the acid-salt\r\ndivides into Glauber's salt and potassium sulfate, which proves the\r\nacid-salt to be a mixture of the neutral salt with its acid. Sodium-acid\r\nphosphate behaves quite differently. After neutralization by a potassium\r\n\"base\" (hydroxide), the salt does not split up; a uniform\r\nsodium-potassium phosphate is obtained. Therefore, phosphoric acid is\r\ntruly three-basic![23]\r\n\r\nThis result has later been confirmed, but the analogy by means of which\r\nit had been obtained was very weak, in certain parts quite wrong.\r\n\r\nThe acids from the two lower oxides of phosphorus were also considered\r\nas three-basic. Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) formulated them in 1846,\r\naccording to the theory of chemical types:\r\n\r\n    (PO)···\r\n            O^{3}  phosphoric acid\r\n      H^{3}\r\n\r\n    (PHO)··\r\n            O^{2}  phosphorus acid\r\n       H^{2}\r\n\r\n    (PH^{2}O)·\r\n               O   hypophosphorous acid.[24]\r\n           H\r\n\r\nFurther proof for these constitutions was sought in the study of the\r\nesters formed when the acids react with alcohols.\r\n\r\nAmong the analogies and generalizations by which the research on\r\nphosphoric acid was supported, and to the results of which it\r\ncontributed a full share, was the new theory of acids. Not oxygen,\r\nLavoisier's general acidifier, but reactive hydrogen determines the\r\ncharacter of acids. In this brief survey, it seems sufficient just to\r\nmention this connection without describing it in detail.\r\n\r\nThe study of phosphoric acids led to important new concepts in\r\ntheoretical chemistry. The finding of polybasicity was extended to other\r\nacids and formed the model that helped to recognize the\r\npolyfunctionality in other compounds, like alcohols and amines. The\r\nhydrogen theory of acids was fundamental for further advance. In another\r\ndimension, it is particularly interesting to see that large-scale\r\napplications followed almost immediately and directly from the new\r\ntheoretical insight. The first and foremost of these applications was in\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhosphates as Plant Nutrients\r\n\r\n\r\nOne hundred years after the discovery of \"cold light,\" the presence of\r\nphosphorus in plants and animals was ascertained, and its form was\r\nestablished as a compound of phosphoric acid. This knowledge had little\r\npractical effect until the \"nature\" of the acid, in its various forms,\r\nwas explained through the work of Thomas Graham. From it, there started\r\na considerable technical development.\r\n\r\nAt about that time (1833), the Duke of Richmond proved that the\r\nfertilizing value of bones resided not in the gelatin, nor in the\r\ncalcium, but in the phosphoric acid. Thus, he confirmed what Théodore de\r\nSaussure had said in 1804, that \"we have no reason to believe\" that\r\nplants can exist without phosphorus. Unknowingly at first, the farmer\r\nhad supplied this element by means of the organic fertilizers he used:\r\nmanure, excrements, bones, and horns. Now, with the value of phosphorus\r\nknown, a search began for mineral phosphates to be applied as\r\nfertilizers. Jean Baptiste Boussingault (1802-1887), an agricultural\r\nchemist in Lyons, traveled to Peru to see the guano deposits. Garcilaso\r\nde la Vega (ca. 1540 to ca. 1616) noted in his history of Peru (1604)\r\nthat guano was used by the Incas as a fertilizer. Two hundred years\r\nlater, Alexander von Humboldt revived this knowledge, and Humphry Davy\r\nwrote about the benefits of guano to the soil. Yet, the application of\r\nthis fertilizer developed only slowly, until Justus Liebig sang its\r\npraise. Imports into England rose and far exceeded those into France\r\nwhere, between 1857 and 1867, about 50,000 tons were annually received.\r\n\r\nThe other great advance in the use of phosphatic plant nutrients started\r\nwith Liebig's recommendation (1840) to treat bones with sulfuric acid\r\nfor solubilization. This idea was not entirely new; since 1832, a\r\nproduction of a \"superphosphate\" from bones and sulfuric acid had been\r\nin progress at Prague. At Rothamsted in 1842, John Bennet Lawes\r\nobtained a patent on the manufacture of superphosphate. Other\r\nmanufactures in England followed and were successful, although James\r\nMuspratt (1793-1886) at Newton lost much time and \"some thousands of\r\npounds\" on Liebig's idea of a \"mineral manure.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--FLORIDA LAND-PEBBLE PHOSPHATE MINING. (From\r\nCarroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States ..._,\r\nplate facing page 58.)]\r\n\r\nIt was difficult enough to establish the efficacy of bones and\r\nartificially produced phosphates in promoting the growth of plants under\r\nspecial conditions of soils and climate; therefore, the question as to\r\nthe action of phosphates in the growing plant was not even seriously\r\nformulated at that time. The beneficial effects were obvious enough to\r\nincrease the use of phosphates as plant nutrients and to call for new\r\nsources of supply. Active developments of phosphate mining and treating\r\nstarted in South Carolina in 1867, and in Florida in 1888.[25]\r\n\r\nIn a reciprocal action, more phosphate application to soils stimulated\r\nincreasing research on the conditions and reactions obtaining in the\r\ncomplex and varying compositions called soil. The findings of\r\nbacteriologists made it clear that physics and chemistry had to be\r\namplified by biology for a real understanding of fertilizer effects.\r\nAfter 1900, for example, Julius Stoklasa (1857-1936) pointed out that\r\nbacterial action in soil solubilizes water-insoluble phosphates and\r\nmakes them available to the plants.[26]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--FLORIDA RIVER-PEBBLE PHOSPHATE MINING. (From\r\nCarroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States ..._,\r\nplate facing page 64.)]\r\n\r\nThe insight into the importance of phosphorus in organisms, especially\r\nsince Liebig's time, is reflected in the work of Friedrich Nietzsche\r\n(1844-1900). This \"re-valuator of all values\" who modestly said of\r\nhimself: \"I am dynamite!\" once explained the human temperaments as\r\ncaused by the inorganic salts they contain: \"The differences in\r\ntemperament are perhaps caused more by the different distribution and\r\nquantities of the inorganic salts than by everything else. Bilious\r\npeople have too little sodium sulfate, the melancholics are lacking in\r\npotassium sulfate and phosphate; too little calcium phosphate in the\r\nphlegmatics. Courageous natures have an excess of iron phosphate.\" (See\r\nvolume 12 of _Nietzsche's Works_, edit. Naumann-Kröner, Leipzig, 1886.)\r\nIn this strange association of inorganic salts with human temperaments,\r\nthe role of iron phosphate as a producer of courage is particularly\r\ninteresting. What would a modern philosopher conclude if he followed the\r\ndevelopment of insight into the composition and function of complex\r\nphosphate compounds in organisms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Inorganic to Organic Phosphates\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the source of phosphorus in natural\r\nphosphates and the chemistry of its oxidation products had been\r\nestablished. The main difficulty that had to be overcome was that these\r\noxidation products existed in so many forms, not only several stages of\r\noxidation, but, in addition, aggregations and condensations of the\r\nphosphoric acids. Once the fundamental chemistry of these acids was\r\nelucidated, the attention of chemists and physiologists turned to the\r\ntask of finding the actual state in which phosphorus compounds were\r\npresent in the organisms. It had been a great advance when it had been\r\nshown that plants need phosphates in their soil. This led to the next\r\nquestion concerning the materials in the body of the plant for which\r\nphosphates were being used and into which they were incorporated.\r\nSimilarly, the knowledge that animals attain their phosphates from the\r\ndigested plant food called, in the next step of scientific inquiry, for\r\ninformation on the nature of phosphates produced from this source.\r\n\r\nThe method used in this inquiry was to subject anatomically separated\r\nparts of the organisms to chemical separations. The means for such\r\nseparations had to be more gentle than the strong heat and destructive\r\nchemicals that had been considered adequate up to then. The\r\ninterpretation of the new results naturally relied on the general\r\nadvance of chemistry, the development of new methods for isolating\r\nsubstances of little stability, of new concepts concerning the\r\narrangements of atoms in the molecules, and of new apparatus to measure\r\ntheir rates of change.\r\n\r\nIn the system of chemistry, as it developed in the first half of the\r\n19th century, the new development can be characterized as the turn from\r\ninorganic to organic phosphates, from the substance of minerals and\r\nstrong chemical interactions to the components in which phosphate groups\r\nremained combined with carbon-containing substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--ELECTRIC FURNACE FOR PRODUCING ELEMENTAL\r\nPHOSPHORUS, invented by Thomas Parker of Newbridge, England, and\r\nassigned to The Electric Construction Corporation of the same place.

Long before he wrote, it was known that phosphoric acid\r\ncombines not only with inorganic bases to form salts, but with alcohols\r\nto form esters. In the middle of the 19th century, Théophile Juste\r\nPelouze (1807-1867) extended this knowledge to an ester of glycerol.\r\nThis proved to be significant in several respects. Glycerol had been\r\nshown by Michel Chevreul (1786-1889) as the substance in fats that is\r\nreleased in the process of soap boiling, when the fatty acids are\r\nconverted into their salts. That it has the nature of an alcohol had\r\nbeen demonstrated by Marcellin Berthelot. Instead of one \"alcoholic\"\r\nhydroxyl group, OH, like ethanol (the alcohol of fermentation), or two\r\nhydroxyl groups (like ethylene glycol), glycerol contains three such\r\ngroups. It was the only \"natural\" alcohol known at that time. That this\r\nalcohol would combine with phosphoric acid could be predicted, but that\r\nthe ester, as obtained by Pelouze, still contained free acidic functions\r\nand formed a water-soluble barium salt was a new experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--PAN FOR DIPPING MATCHSTICKS into phosphorus\r\npaste, about 1870.

The\r\n\"well-known scheme of alcoholic fermentation\" according to Albert Jan\r\nKluyver (1888-1956), presented before the Society of Chemical Industry\r\nin the Royal Institution, March 7, 1951. In _Chemistry & Industry_,\r\n1952, page 136 ff., Kluyver restates that \"... the fermentation of one\r\nmolecule of glucose is indissolubly connected with the formation of two\r\nmolecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) out of two molecules of\r\nadenosine diphosphate (ADP).\"]\r\n\r\nShortly after this experience had been gained, it became valuable for\r\nunderstanding the chemical nature of a new substance extracted from a\r\nnatural organ. This substance was named lecithin by its discoverer,\r\nNicolas Théodore Gobley[27] (1811-1876), because he obtained it from egg\r\nyolk (in Greek, _lékidos_). He used ether and alcohol for this\r\nextraction. Had he used water and mineral acid instead, he would not\r\nhave found lecithin, but only its components. As Gobley and, slightly\r\nlater, Oscar Liebreich (1839-1908), subjected lecithin to treatment with\r\nboiling water and acid, they separated it into three parts. One of them\r\nwas the glycerophosphoric acid of Pelouze, the second was the well-known\r\nstearic acid of Chevreul, but the third was somewhat mysterious. This\r\nthird substance was the same as one previously noticed when nerves had\r\nbeen subjected to an extraction by boiling water and acid and,\r\ntherefore, called nerve-substance or neurine. Adolf Friedrich Strecker\r\n(1822-1871) established the identity of this neurine with a product he\r\nhad extracted from bile and which went under the name of choline.\r\nAdolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) succeeded in synthesizing this substance from\r\nethylene oxide, CH_2.O.CH_2 and trimethylamine N(CH_3)_3.[28] Thus, all\r\nthree parts were identified, and Strecker put them together to construct\r\na chemical formula for lecithin, glycerophosphoric acid combined with a\r\nfatty acid and with choline (a hydrate of neurine).\r\n\r\n                        { OH       }\r\n                      N { (CH_3)_3 } Choline\r\n                        { C_2H_4O  }\r\n\r\n\r\n    C_18H_33O_2 }               HO }\r\n                }                  } PO\r\n    C_16H_31O_2 }          C_3H_5O }\r\n\r\n    Fatty Acids        Glycerophosphate\r\n          \\--------v-------/\r\n               Lecithin\r\n          according to Strecker\r\n\r\nThis formula was not quite correct. Richard Willstätter showed that an\r\ninternal neutralization takes place between the amino group and the free\r\nacidic residue. This is expressed in his lecithin formula of 1918.\r\n\r\n    CH_{2}·O·R\r\n    |\r\n    CH_{2}·O·R_2\r\n    |\r\n    |           O·CH_{2}·CH_{2}\r\n    |          /          \\\r\n    CH_{2}·O--P=O         N(CH_{3})_{3}\r\n               \\          /\r\n                \\---O----/\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lecithin (1918)]\r\n\r\nWhen the aim was to distill elementary phosphorus out of an organic\r\nmaterial, it did not matter whether this was fresh or putrified. For\r\nobtaining lecithin out of egg yolk and similar materials, it was\r\nessential to use it in fresh condition. Otherwise, enzymes would have\r\ndecomposed it. Through more recent work, four enzymes have been\r\nseparated, which act specifically in decomposing lecithin. Enzyme A\r\nremoves one fatty acid and leaves a complex residue, called\r\nlysolecithin, intact. Enzyme B attacks this residue and splits off the\r\nremaining fatty acid group from it, enzyme C liberates only the choline\r\nfrom lecithin, and enzyme D opens lecithin at the ester bond between\r\nglycerol and phosphoric acid. This is shown in the following diagram.\r\n\r\n    ENZYMATIC SPLITTING OF LECITHINS\r\n\r\n    ENZYME SUBSTRATE     PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n    A      Lecithin      Lysolecithin and fatty\r\n                           acids.\r\n\r\n    B      Lysolecithin  Glycero-phospho-choline\r\n                           and fatty acids.\r\n\r\n    C      Lecithin      Phosphatidic acid and\r\n                           choline.\r\n\r\n    D      Lecithin      Phosphoryl choline and\r\n                           diglyceride.\r\n\r\nSeveral fatty acids can be present in lecithin from various sources:\r\npalmitic and oleic acid, besides the stearic acid which at first had\r\nbeen thought the only one involved. In another group of extracts from\r\nbrain or nerve tissue, amino-ethanol H_{2}NCH_{2}CH_{2}OH is found\r\ninstead of the choline of lecithin. The variations include the alcohol,\r\nto which the fatty acids and choline phosphate are attached, for\r\nexample, glycerol can be replaced by the so-called meat-sugar, inositol,\r\nwhich has six hydroxyl groups in its hexagon-shaped molecule\r\nC_{6}H_{6}(OH)_{6}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--EDUARD BUCHNER (1860-1917) received the Nobel\r\nPrize in Chemistry for his discovery of cell-free fermentation, the\r\nfirst step in finding the role of phosphate in fermentations (1907).]\r\n\r\nThe generally similar behavior of these phosphate-and fat-containing\r\nsubstances was emphasized by Ludwig Thudichum (1829-1901). He coined the\r\nname phosphatides for this group of substances from seeds and\r\nnerves.[29] His work on the phosphates in brain substance aroused\r\nparticular interest. When William Crookes drew his highly imaginative\r\npicture of an \"evolution\" of the chemical elements, he put into it\r\n\"phosphorus for the brain, salt for the sea, clay for the solid\r\nearth....\"[30] But phosphatides occur in many places of organisms, in\r\nbacteria, in leaves and roots of plants, in fat and tissues of animals.\r\nAnd where phosphatides are found, there are also enzymes that\r\nspecifically act on them. They are called phosphatases to imply that\r\nthey split the phosphatides. In addition, enzymes are present, which\r\ntransfer phosphate groups from one compound to another. They are more\r\nabundant in seeds of high fat content than in the more starch-containing\r\nseeds, but even potatoes and orange juice have phosphatases.[31]\r\n\r\nThus, from phosphatides, phosphoric acid is generated, and they could\r\nalso be called phosphagens. Since 1926, however, the name phosphagens\r\nhas been reserved for a group of organic substances that release their\r\nphosphoric acid very readily. The link between phosphorus and carbon is\r\nprovided by oxygen in the phosphatides, by nitrogen in the phosphagens.\r\nIn vertebrates, the basis for the phosphoric acid is creatine, whereas\r\ninvertebrates have arginine instead.\r\n\r\n      H    OH                   OH\r\n      |   /                    /\r\n      N--P=O              NH--P=O\r\n     /    \\              /     \\\r\n    C=NH   OH           C=NH    OH\r\n     \\                   \\\r\n      N--CH_{2}COOH       NH\r\n      |                   |\r\n      CH_{3}              CH_{2}\r\n                          |\r\n    Creatine phosphate    CH_{2}\r\n                          |\r\n                          CH_{2}\r\n                          |\r\n                          CHNH_{2}\r\n                          |\r\n                          COOH\r\n\r\n                       Arginine phosphate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNuclein and Nucleic Acids\r\n\r\n\r\nAll parts of an organism are essential for life. Only with this in mind\r\ndoes it make sense to say that the most important part of the cell is\r\nits nucleus. From the nuclei of cells in pus and in salmon sperm, Johann\r\nFriedrich Miescher (1811-1887) obtained a peculiar kind of substance,\r\nwhich he named nuclein (1868). Its phosphate content was easily\r\ndiscovered, but to find the exact proportions and the nature of the\r\nother components required special methods of separation from\r\nphosphatides and other proteins. It was difficult to develop such\r\nmethods at a time when little was known about the properties, and\r\nparticularly the stability, of a nuclein. For preparing nuclein from\r\nyeast cells, Felix Hoppe-Seyler (1825-1895) described the following\r\ndetails: Yeast is dispersed in water to extract soluble materials, like\r\nsalts or sugars. After a few hours, the insoluble material is separated,\r\nwashed once more with water, and then extracted with a very dilute\r\nsolution of sodium hydroxide. The slightly alkaline solution, freed from\r\ninsoluble residues, is slowly added to a weak hydrochloric acid. A\r\nprecipitate forms which is separated by filtration, washed with dilute\r\nacid, then with cold alcohol, and finally extracted by boiling alcohol.\r\nThe dried residue is the nuclein.[32] It contains six percent\r\nphosphorus. A little more washing with water, a slightly longer\r\ntreatment with acid or alcohol gives products of lower phosphorus\r\ncontent. Many experimental variations were necessary to establish the\r\nprocedure that leads to purification without alteration of the natural\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nThis was also true for the methods of chemical degradation, carried out\r\nin order to find the components of nucleins in their highest state of\r\nnatural complexity. It was learned for example, that the special kind of\r\ncarbohydrate present in nucleins was very susceptible to change under\r\nthe conditions of hydrolysis by acids. Phoebus Aaron Theodor Levine\r\n(1869-1940), therefore, used the digestion by a living organism. With E.\r\nS. London, he introduced a solution of nucleic acid into, e.g., the\r\ngastrointestinal segment of a dog through a gastric fistula and withdrew\r\nthe product of digestion through an intestinal fistula. Fortunately, the\r\nproducts obtained in such degradations were not new in themselves. The\r\ncarbohydrate in this nucleic acid proved to be identical with D-ribose,\r\nwhich Emil Fischer had artificially made from arabinose and named ribose\r\nto indicate this relationship (1891). The nitrogenous products of the\r\ndegradation were identical with substances previously prepared in the\r\nlong study of uric acid. In the course of this study, Emil Fischer\r\nestablished uric acid and a number of its derivatives as having the\r\nelementary skeleton of what he called \"pure uric acid,\" abbreviated to\r\npurine. Out of Adolf Baeyer's work on barbituric acid came the knowledge\r\nof pyrimidine and its derivatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--ALBRECHT KOSSEL (1853-1927) received the\r\nNobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1910 for his work on nucleic\r\nsubstances, which contain a high proportion of phosphorus. The chemical\r\nbonds of this phosphorus in the molecules of nucleic substances were\r\ndetermined in later work. (_Photo courtesy National Library of Medicine,\r\nWashington, D.C._)]\r\n\r\nFrom these findings, together with what Oswald Schmiedeberg (1838-1921)\r\nhad established concerning the presence of four phosphate groups in the\r\nmolecule (1899), Robert Feulgen (1884-1955) constructed the following\r\nscheme of a nucleic acid.

From 100 grams of such muscle,\r\n0.35-0.40 grams of this compound were isolated. If the muscle is at\r\nrest, the compound contains three molecules of phosphoric acid, linked\r\nthrough oxygen atoms. It was named adenosine triphosphate or\r\nadenyltriphosphoric acid,[34] usually abbreviated by the symbol ATP. It\r\nreleases one phosphoric acid group very easily and goes over in the\r\ndiphosphate, ADP, but it can also lose 2 P-groups as pyrophosphoric acid\r\nand leave the monophosphate, AMP.\r\n\r\n     N==C--NH_{2}\r\n     |  |\r\n    HC  C--N     +----O----+\r\n     || ||  \\\\   |         |\r\n     || ||   CH  |  OH  OH |  H       OH\r\n     || ||  /    |  |   |  |  |      /\r\n     N--C--N-----C--C---C--C--C--O--P=O\r\n                 |  |   |  |  |      \\\r\n                 H  H   H  H  H       OH\r\n    \\---------/\\---------------/\\--------/\r\n      Adenine      D-Ribose      Phosphoric\r\n                                   acid\r\n\r\nThis change of ATP was considered to be the main source of energy in\r\nmuscle contraction by Otto Meyerhof.[35] The corresponding derivatives\r\nof guanine, cytosine, and uracil were also found, and they are active in\r\nthe temporary transfer of phosphoric acid groups in biological\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nThus, the study of organic phosphates progressed from the comparatively\r\nsimple esters connected with fatty substances of organisms to the\r\nproteins and the nuclear substances of the cell. The proportional amount\r\nof phosphorus in the former was larger than in the latter; the actual\r\nimportance and function in the life of organisms, however, is not\r\nmeasured by the quantity but determined by the special nature of the\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--OTTO MEYERHOF (1884-1951) received one-half\r\nof the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1922 for his discovery\r\nof the metabolism of lactic acid in muscle, which involves the action of\r\nphosphates, especially adenosine duophosphates.

CORI (b. 1896) AND HIS WIFE, GERTY T.\r\nCORI (1896-1957) received part of the Nobel Prize in Medicine and\r\nPhysiology in 1947 for their study on glycogen conversion. In the course\r\nof this study, they identified glucose 1-phosphate, now usually referred\r\nto as \"Cori ester,\" and its function in the glycogen cycle. (_Photo\r\ncourtesy National Library of Medicine, Washington, D.C._)]\r\n\r\nThe study of this function is the newest phase in the history of\r\nphosphorus and represents the culmination of the previous efforts. This\r\nnewest phase developed out of an accidental discovery concerning one of\r\nthe oldest organic-chemical industries, the production of alcohol by the\r\nfermentative action of yeast on sugar. A transition of carbohydrates\r\nthrough phosphate compounds to the end products of the fermentation\r\nprocess was found, and it gradually proved to be a kind of model for a\r\nhost of biological processes.\r\n\r\nSpecific phosphates were thus found to be indispensable for life. In\r\nreverse, the wrong kind of phosphates can destroy life. As a result, an\r\nimportant part of the new phase in phosphorus history consisted in the\r\nstudy--and use--of antibiotic phosphorus compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhosphates in Biological Processes\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first indication that phosphorus is important for life came from the\r\nexperience that plants take it up from the substances in the soil. They\r\nincorporate it in their body substance. What makes phosphorus so\r\nimportant that they cannot grow without it? The next insight was that\r\nanimals acquire it from their plant food. It is then found in bones, in\r\nfat and nerve tissue, in all cells and particularly in the cell nuclei.\r\nWhat are its functions there?\r\n\r\nThe answers to such questions were developed from the study of a\r\nlong-known process, the conversion of carbohydrates into carbon dioxide\r\nand alcohol by yeast. It started with Eduard Buchner's discovery of\r\n1890, that fermentation is produced by a preparation from yeast in which\r\nall living cells have been removed. When yeast is dead-ground and\r\npressed out, the juice still has the ability to produce fermentation.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, but in many ways characteristic for the process of\r\nscience, that the \"riddle\" of phosphorus in life was solved by first\r\neliminating life. In such \"lifeless\" fermentations, Arthur Harden found\r\nthat the conversion of sugar begins with the formation of a hexose\r\nphosphate (1904). The \"ferment\" of yeast, called zymase, proved to be a\r\ncomposite of several enzymes. Hans von Euler-Chelpin isolated one part\r\nof zymase, which remains active even after heating its solution to the\r\nboiling point. From 1 kilogram of yeast, he obtained 20 milligrams of\r\nthis heat-stable enzyme, which he called cozymase and identified as a\r\nnucleotide composed of a purine, a sugar, and phosphoric acid.[36] In\r\nthe years between the two World Wars, zymase was further resolved into\r\nmore enzymes, one of them the coenzyme I, which was shown to be ADP\r\nconnected with another molecule of ribose attached to the amide of\r\nnicotinic acid, or diphosphopyridine nucleotide:\r\n\r\n       ^                           NH_{2}\r\n      / \\\\                         |\r\n     /   \\\\                    N   ^\r\n     ||   |-CONH_{2}          //\\ / \\\\\r\n     ||   |                   |  ||  N\r\n     \\   //                   |  ||  |\r\n       N_{+}                  N--+   |\r\n       |                      |   \\//\r\n       |                      |    N\r\n    H--C------+            H--C------+\r\n       |      |               |      |\r\n    H--C--OH  |            H--C--OH  |\r\n       |      O               |      O\r\n    H--C--OH  |            H--C--OH  |\r\n       |      |               |      |\r\n    H--C------+   O     O  H--C------+\r\n       |          ||    ||    |\r\n       CH_{2}--O--P--O--P--O--CH_{2}\r\n                  |     |\r\n                  O-    OH\r\n\r\n                 Coenzyme I\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--FRITZ A. LIPMANN (b. 1899) shared with Hans\r\nAdolf Krebs the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1953 for his\r\nwork on coenzyme A. He discovered acetyl phosphate as the substance in\r\nbacteria, which transfers phosphate to adenylic acid.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--ALEXANDER R. TODD (b. 1907) received the\r\nNobel Prize in Chemistry in 1957 for his research on nucleotides. He\r\ndetermined the position of the phosphate groups in the molecule and\r\nconfirmed it by synthesis of dinucleotide phosphates.]\r\n\r\nIts function is connected with the transfer of hydrogen between\r\nintermediates formed through phosphate-transferring enzymes.\r\nFermentation proceeds by a cascade of processes, in which phosphate\r\ngroups swing back and forth, and equilibria between ATP with ADP play a\r\nmajor role.\r\n\r\nMany of the enzymes are closely related to vitamins. Thus, cocarboxylase\r\nA, which takes part in the separation of carbon dioxide from an\r\nintermediate fermentation product, is the phosphate of vitamin B_{1}.\r\nOthers of the B vitamins contain phosphate groups, for example those of\r\nthe B_{2} and B_{6} group, and in B_{12}, one lonely phosphate forms a\r\nbridge in the large molecule that contains one atom of cobalt:\r\nC_{63}H_{90}N_{14}O_{14}PCo. The formation of vitamin A from carotine\r\noccurs under the influence of ATP.\r\n\r\nThe first stages in fermentation are like those in respiration, which\r\nends with carbon dioxide and water. These two are the materials for the\r\nreverse process in photosynthesis. When light is absorbed by the\r\nchlorophyll of green plants, one of the initial reactions is a transfer\r\nof hydrogen from water to a triphosphopyridine nucleotide, which later\r\nacts to reduce the carbon dioxide. Under the influence of ATP,\r\nphosphoglyceric acid is synthesized and further built up by way of\r\ncarbohydrate phosphates to hexose sugars and finally to starch. In many\r\nstarchy fruits, a small proportion of phosphate remains attached to the\r\nend product.\r\n\r\nThe synthesis of proteins is under the control of deoxyribonucleic acid\r\nor ribonucleic acid, abbreviated by the symbols DNA and RNA. The genes\r\nin the nucleus are parts of a giant DNA molecule. RNA is a universal\r\nconstituent of all living cells. Where protein synthesis is intense, the\r\ncontent in RNA is high. Thus, the spinning glands of silkworms are\r\nextraordinarily rich in RNA.[37]\r\n\r\nIn his research on the radioactive isotope P^32, George de Hevesy gained\r\nsome insight into the surprising mobility of phosphates in organisms: \"A\r\nphosphate radical taken up with the food may first participate in the\r\nphosphorylation of glucose in the intestinal mucose, soon afterwards\r\npass into the circulation as free phosphate, enter a red corpuscle,\r\nbecome incorporated with an adenosine triphosphoric-acid molecule,\r\nparticipate in a glycolytic process going on in the corpuscle, return to\r\ncirculation, penetrate into the liver cells, participate in the\r\nformation of a phosphatide molecule, after a short interval enter the\r\ncirculation in this form, penetrate into the spleen, and leave this\r\norgan after some time as a constituent of a lymphocyte. We may meet the\r\nphosphate radical again as a constituent of the plasma, from which it\r\nmay find its way into the skeleton.\"[38] Much has been added in the last\r\n30 years to complete this picture in many details and to extend it to\r\nother biochemical processes, including even the changes of the pigments\r\nin the retina in the visual process, or in the conversion of chemical\r\nenergy to light by bacteria and insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicines and Poisons\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the delicate balance of these processes, disturbances may occur which\r\ncan be remedied by specific phosphate-containing medicines. Thus,\r\nadenosine phosphate has been recommended in cases of angina pectoris\r\nand marketed under trade names like sarkolyt, or in compounds named\r\nangiolysine. A considerable number of physiologically active organic\r\nphosphates can be found in the patent literature.[39] Yeast itself is\r\nconsidered to be a valuable food additive.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are phosphate compounds that act as poisons.\r\nOne group of such compounds was discovered in 1929 by W. Lange, who\r\nwrote: \"Of interest is the strong action of mono-fluorophosphate esters\r\non the human body--the effect is produced by very small quantities.\"[40]\r\nDiisopropyl fluorophosphate has since become a potential agent for\r\nchemical warfare. It inactivates an enzyme which controls the\r\ntransmission of nerve impulses to muscle, acetylcholine esterase.\r\n\r\nOrganic esters of phosphoric acids are used as insecticides. The\r\nhexa-ethylester of tetraphosphoric acid, prepared by Gerhard Schrader by\r\nheating triethylphosphate with phosphorus oxychloride,[41] actually\r\ncontains tetraethylpyrophosphate (TEPP) among others. Bayer's Dipterex,\r\nthe dimethyl ester of 2,2,2-trichloro-1-hydroxyethyl-phosphonate, has\r\nbeen modified to dimethyl-2,2-dichlorovinyl-phosphate and is especially\r\nactive against the oriental fruit fly.[42]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--ARTHUR KORNBERG (b. 1918) AND SEVERO OCHOA\r\n(b. 1905) shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1959.\r\nKornberg received it for research on the biological synthesis of\r\ndeoxyribonucleic acid. In particular, he found that four triphosphate\r\ncomponents and a small amount of the end product as a \"template\" had to\r\nbe present for the enzymatic synthesis. Ochoa received his share of the\r\nprize for research in ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. In\r\nparticular, Ochoa synthesized polyribonucleotides and used the\r\nradioactive isotope, P^{32}.

The eight models\r\n     described highlight the fundamental advances which have occurred\r\n     between primitive man's first systematic use of fire for excavating\r\n     rock in mining, and the use in combination of compressed air, an\r\n     iron lining, and a movable shield in a subaqueous tunnel at the end\r\n     of the 19th century._\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR: _Robert M. Vogel is curator of heavy machinery and\r\n     civil engineering, in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of\r\n     History and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, civil engineering is a field in which the ultimate\r\ngoal is the assemblage of materials into a useful structural form\r\naccording to a scientifically derived plan which is based on various\r\nnatural and man-imposed conditions. This is true whether the result be,\r\nfor example, a dam, a building, a bridge, or even the fixed plant of a\r\nrailroad. However, one principal branch of the field is based upon an\r\nentirely different concept. In the engineering of tunnels the utility of\r\nthe \"structure\" is derived not from the bringing together of elements\r\nbut from the separation of one portion of naturally existing material\r\nfrom another to permit passage through a former barrier.\r\n\r\nIn tunneling hard, firm rock, this is practically the entire compass\r\nof the work: breaking away the rock from the mother mass, and,\r\ncoincidently, removing it from the workings. The opposite extreme in\r\nconditions is met in the soft-ground tunnel, driven through material\r\nincapable of supporting itself above the tunnel opening. Here, the\r\nexcavation of the tunneled substance is of relatively small concern,\r\neclipsed by the problem of preventing the surrounding material from\r\ncollapsing into the bore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--HOOSAC TUNNEL. METHOD OF WORKING EARLY\r\nSECTIONS of the project; blast holes drilled by hand jacking.\r\nMHT model--1/2\" scale. (Smithsonian photo 49260-L.)]\r\n\r\nIn one other principal respect does tunnel engineering differ widely\r\nfrom its collateral branches of civil engineering. Few other physical\r\nundertakings are approached with anything like the uncertainty\r\nattending a tunnel work. This is even more true in mountain tunnels,\r\nfor which test borings frequently cannot be made to determine the\r\nnature of the material and the geologic conditions which will be\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nThe course of tunnel work is not subject to an overall preliminary\r\nsurvey; the engineer is faced with not only the inability to\r\nanticipate general contingencies common to all engineering work, but\r\nwith the peculiar and often overwhelming unpredictability of the very\r\nbasis of his work.\r\n\r\nSubaqueous and soft-ground work on the other hand, while still subject\r\nto many indeterminates, is now far more predictable than during its\r\nearly history, simply because the nature of the adverse condition\r\nprevailing eventually was understood to be quite predictable. The\r\nsteady pressures of earth and water to refill the excavated area are\r\ntoday overcome with relative ease and consistency by the tunneler.\r\n\r\nIn tunneling as in no other branch of civil engineering did empiricism\r\nso long resist the advance of scientific theory; in no other did the\r\n\"practical engineer\" remain to such an extent the key figure in\r\nestablishing the success or failure of a project. The Hoosac Tunnel,\r\nafter 25 years of legislative, financial, and technical difficulties,\r\nin 1875 was finally driven to successful completion only by the\r\nefforts of a group who, while in the majority were trained civil\r\nengineers, were to an even greater extent men of vast practical\r\nability, more at home in field than office.\r\n\r\nDeWitt C. Haskin (see p. 234), during the inquest that followed the\r\ndeath of a number of men in a blowout of his pneumatically driven\r\nHudson River Tunnel in 1880, stated in his own defense: \"I am not a\r\nscientific engineer, but a practical one ... I know nothing of\r\nmathematics; in my experience I have grasped such matters as a whole;\r\nI believe that the study of mathematics in that kind of work\r\n[tunneling] has a tendency to dwarf the mind rather than enlighten\r\nit....\" An extreme attitude perhaps, and one which by no means adds to\r\nHaskin's stature, but a not unusual one in tunnel work at the time. It\r\nwould not of course be fair to imply that such men as Herman Haupt,\r\nBrunel the elder, and Greathead were not accomplished theoretical\r\nengineers. But it was their innate ability to evaluate and control the\r\noverlying physical conditions of the site and work that made possible\r\ntheir significant contributions to the development of tunnel\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\nTunneling remained largely independent of the realm of mathematical\r\nanalysis long after the time when all but the most insignificant\r\nengineering works were designed by that means. Thus, as structural\r\nengineering has advanced as the result of a flow of new theoretical\r\nconcepts, new, improved, and strengthened materials, and new methods\r\nof fastening, the progress of tunnel engineering has been due more to\r\nthe continual refinement of constructional techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW HALL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of History and Technology has recently been established\r\na Hall of Civil Engineering in which the engineering of tunnels is\r\ncomprehensively treated from the historical standpoint--something not\r\npreviously done in an American museum. The guiding precept of the\r\nexhibit has not been to outline exhaustively the entire history of\r\ntunneling, but rather to show the fundamental advances which have\r\noccurred between primitive man's first systematic use of fire for\r\nexcavating rock in mining, and the use in combination of compressed\r\nair, iron lining, and a movable shield in a subaqueous tunnel at the\r\nend of the 19th century. This termination date was selected because it\r\nwas during the period from about 1830 to 1900 that the most\r\nconcentrated development took place, and during which tunneling became\r\na firmly established and important branch of civil engineering and\r\nindeed, of modern civilization. The techniques of present-day\r\ntunneling are so fully related in current writing that it was deemed\r\nfar more useful to devote the exhibit entirely to a segment of the\r\nfield's history which is less commonly treated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--HOOSAC TUNNEL. WORKING OF LATER STAGES with\r\nBurleigh pneumatic drills mounted on carriages. The bottom heading is\r\nbeing drilled in preparation for blasting out with nitroglycerine.\r\nMHT model--1/2\" scale. (Smithsonian photo 49260-M.)]\r\n\r\nThe major advances, which have already been spoken of as being ones of\r\ntechnique rather than theory, devolve quite naturally into two basic\r\nclassifications: the one of supporting a mass of loose, unstable,\r\npressure-exerting material--soft-ground tunneling; and the\r\ndiametrically opposite problem of separating rock from the basic mass\r\nwhen it is so firm and solid that it can support its own overbearing\r\nweight as an opening is forced through it--rock, or hard-ground\r\ntunneling.\r\n\r\nTo exhibit the sequence in a thorough manner, inviting and capable of\r\neasy and correct interpretation by the nonprofessional viewer, models\r\noffered the only logical means of presentation. Six tunnels were\r\nselected, all driven in the 19th century. Each represents either a\r\nfundamental, new concept of tunneling technique, or an important,\r\nearly application of one. Models of these works form the basis of the\r\nexhibit. No effort was made to restrict the work to projects on\r\nAmerican soil. This would, in fact, have been quite impossible if an\r\naccurate picture of tunnel technology was to be drawn; for as in\r\nvirtually all other areas of technology, the overall development\r\nin this field has been international. The art of mining was first\r\ndeveloped highly in the Middle Ages in the Germanic states; the tunnel\r\nshield was invented by a Frenchman residing in England, and the use of\r\ncompressed air to exclude the water from subaqueous tunnels was first\r\nintroduced on a major work by an American. In addition, the two main\r\nsubdivisions, rock and soft-ground tunneling, are each introduced by\r\na model not of an actual working, but of one typifying early classical\r\nmethods which were in use for centuries until the comparatively recent\r\ndevelopment of more efficient systems of earth support and rock\r\nbreaking. Particular attention is given to accuracy of detail\r\nthroughout the series of eight models; original sources of descriptive\r\nand graphic information were used in their construction wherever\r\npossible. In all cases except the introductory model in the\r\nrock-tunneling series, representing copper mining by early\r\ncivilizations, these sources were contemporary accounts.\r\n\r\nThe plan to use a uniform scale of reduction throughout, in order\r\nto facilitate the viewers' interpretation, unfortunately proved\r\nimpractical, due to the great difference in the amount of area to be\r\nencompassed in different models, and the necessity that the cases\r\nholding them be of uniform height. The related models of the Broadway\r\nand Tower Subways represent short sections of tunnels only 8 feet or\r\nso in diameter enabling a relatively large scale, 1-1/2 inches to the\r\nfoot, to be used. Conversely, in order that the model of Brunel's\r\nThames Tunnel be most effective, it was necessary to include one of\r\nthe vertical terminal shafts used in its construction. These were\r\nabout 60 feet in depth, and thus the much smaller scale of 1/4 inch\r\nto the foot was used. This variation is not as confusing as might be\r\nthought, for the human figures in each model provide an immediate and\r\npositive sense of proportion and scale.\r\n\r\nCareful thought was devoted to the internal lighting of the models, as\r\nthis was one of the critical factors in establishing, so far as is\r\npossible in a model, an atmosphere convincingly representative of work\r\nconducted solely by artificial light. Remarkable realism was achieved\r\nby use of plastic rods to conduct light to the tiny sources of tunnel\r\nillumination, such as the candles on the miners' hats in the Hoosac\r\nTunnel, and the gas lights in the Thames Tunnel. No overscaled\r\nminiature bulbs, generally applied in such cases, were used. At\r\nseveral points where the general lighting within the tunnel proper has\r\nbeen kept at a low level to simulate the natural atmosphere of the\r\nwork, hidden lamps can be operated by push-button in order to bring\r\nout detail which otherwise would be unseen.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the material in the Museum's tunneling section\r\nfurther extends the two major aspects of tunneling. Space limitations\r\ndid not permit treatment of the many interesting ancillary matters\r\nvital to tunnel engineering, such as the unique problems of\r\nsubterranean surveying, and the extreme accuracy required in the\r\ntriangulation and subsequent guidance of the boring in long mountain\r\ntunnels; nor the difficult problems of ventilating long workings, both\r\nduring driving and in service; nor the several major methods developed\r\nthrough the years for driving or constructing tunnels in other than\r\nthe conventional manner.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRock Tunneling\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the art of tunneling soft ground is of relatively recent origin,\r\nthat of rock tunneling is deeply rooted in antiquity. However,\r\nthe line of its development is not absolutely direct, but is\r\nmore logically followed through a closely related branch of\r\ntechnology--mining. The development of mining techniques is a\r\npractically unbroken one, whereas there appears little continuity or\r\nrelationship between the few works undertaken before about the 18th\r\ncentury for passage through the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were the first people in recorded history to have driven\r\nopenings, often of considerable magnitude, through solid rock. As is\r\ntrue of all major works of that nation, the capability of such grand\r\nproportion was due solely to the inexhaustible supply of human power\r\nand the casual evaluation of life. The tombs and temples won from the\r\nrock masses of the Nile Valley are monuments of perseverance rather\r\nthan technical skill. Neither the Egyptians nor any other peoples\r\nbefore the Middle Ages have left any consistent evidence that they\r\nwere able to pierce ground that would not support itself above the\r\nopening as would firm rock. In Egypt were established the methods of\r\nrock breaking that were to remain classical until the first use of\r\ngun-powder blasting in the 17th century which formed the basis of the\r\nensuing technology of mining.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the religious motives which inspired the earliest rock\r\nexcavations, more constant and universal throughout history has been\r\nthe incentive to obtain the useful and decorative minerals hidden\r\nbeneath the earth's surface. It was the miner who developed the\r\nmethods introduced by the early civilizations to break rock away from\r\nthe primary mass, and who added the refinements of subterranean\r\nsurveying and ventilating, all of which were later to be assimilated\r\ninto the new art of driving tunnels of large diameter. The connection\r\nis the more evident from the fact that tunnelmen are still known as\r\nminers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER MINING, B.C.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the first model of the sequence, reflecting elemental\r\nrock-breaking techniques, depicts a hard-rock copper mine (fig. 1).\r\nDue to the absence of specific information about such works during the\r\npre-Christian eras, this model is based on no particular period or\r\nlocale, but represents in a general way, a mine in the Rio Tinto area\r\nof Spain where copper has been extracted since at least 1000 B.C.\r\nSimilar workings existed in the Tirol as early as about 1600 B.C. Two\r\nmeans of breaking away the rock are shown: to the left is the most\r\nprimitive of all methods, the hammer and chisel, which require no\r\nfurther description. At the right side, the two figures are shown\r\nutilizing the first rock-breaking method in which a force beyond that\r\nof human muscles was employed, the age-old \"fire-setting\" method. The\r\nrock was thoroughly heated by a fierce fire built against its face and\r\nthen suddenly cooled by dashing water against it. The thermal shock\r\ndisintegrated the rock or ore into bits easily removable by hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--HOOSAC TUNNEL. Bottom of the central shaft\r\nshowing elevator car and rock skip; pumps at far right. In the center,\r\nthe top bench is being drilled by a single column-mounted Burleigh\r\ndrill. MHT model--1/2\" scale. (Smithsonian photo 49260-N.)]\r\n\r\nThe practice of this method below ground, of course, produced a\r\nfearfully vitiated atmosphere. It is difficult to imagine whether the\r\nsmoke, the steam, or the toxic fumes from the roasting ore was\r\nthe more distressing to the miners. Even when performed by labor\r\nconsidered more or less expendable, the method could be employed only\r\nwhere there was ventilation of some sort: natural chimneys and\r\nconvection currents were the chief sources of air circulation. Despite\r\nthe drawbacks of the fire system, its simplicity and efficacy weighed\r\nso heavily in its favor that its history of use is unbroken almost to\r\nthe present day. Fire setting was of greatest importance during the\r\nyears of intensive mining in Europe before the advent of explosive\r\nblasting, but its use in many remote areas hardly slackened until the\r\nearly 20th century because of its low cost when compared to powder.\r\nFor this same reason, it did have limited application in actual tunnel\r\nwork until about 1900.\r\n\r\nDirect handwork with pick, chisel and hammer, and fire setting were\r\nthe principal means of rock removal for centuries. Although various\r\nwedging systems were also in favor in some situations, their\r\nimportance was so slight that they were not shown in the model.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOSAC TUNNEL\r\n\r\nIt was possible in the model series, without neglecting any major\r\nadvancement in the art of rock tunneling, to complete the sequence of\r\ndevelopment with only a single additional model. Many of the greatest\r\nworks of civil engineering have been those concerned directly with\r\ntransport, and hence are the product of the present era, beginning in\r\nthe early 19th century. The development of the ancient arts of route\r\nlocation, bridge construction, and tunnel driving received a powerful\r\nstimulation after 1800 under the impetus of the modern canal, highway,\r\nand, especially, the railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Hoosac Tunnel, driven through Hoosac Mountain in the very\r\nnorthwest corner of Massachusetts between 1851 and 1875, was the first\r\nmajor tunneling work in the United States. Its importance is due not\r\nso much to this as to its being literally the fountainhead of modern\r\nrock-tunneling technology. The remarkable thing is that the work was\r\nbegun using methods of driving almost unchanged during centuries\r\nprevious, and was completed twenty years later by techniques which\r\nwere, for the day, almost totally mechanized. The basic pattern of\r\noperation set at Hoosac, using pneumatic rock drills and efficient\r\nexplosives, remains practically unchanged today.\r\n\r\nThe general history of the Hoosac project is so thoroughly recorded\r\nthat the briefest outline of its political aspects will suffice here.\r\nHoosac Mountain was the chief obstacle in the path of a railroad\r\nprojected between Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Troy, New York.\r\nThe line was launched by a group of Boston merchants to provide a\r\ndirect route to the rapidly developing West, in competition with the\r\ncoastal routes via New York. The only route economically reasonable\r\nincluded a tunnel of nearly five miles through the mountain--a\r\nlength absolutely without precedent, and an immense undertaking in\r\nview of the relatively primitive rock-working methods then available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--BURLEIGH ROCK DRILL, improved model of about\r\n1870, mounted on frame for surface work. (Catalog and price list: The\r\nBurleigh Rock Drill Company, 1876.)]\r\n\r\nThe bore's great length and the desire for rapid exploitation inspired\r\ninnovation from the outset of the work. The earliest attempts at\r\nmechanization, although ineffectual and without influence on tunnel\r\nengineering until many years later, are of interest. These took the\r\nform of several experimental machines of the \"full area\" type,\r\nintended to excavate the entire face of the work in a single operation\r\nby cutting one or more concentric grooves in the rock. The rock\r\nremaining between the grooves was to be blasted out. The first such\r\nmachine tested succeeded in boring a 24-foot diameter opening for 10\r\nfeet before its total failure. Several later machines proved of equal\r\nmerit.[2] It was the Baltimore and Ohio's eminent chief engineer,\r\nBenjamin H. Latrobe, who in his _Report on the Hoosac Tunnel_\r\n(Baltimore, Oct. 1, 1862, p. 125) stated that such apparatus contained\r\nin its own structure the elements of failure, \"... as they require\r\nthe machines to do too much and the powder too little of the work,\r\nthus contradicting the fundamental principles upon which all\r\nlabor-saving machinery is framed ... I could only look upon it as a\r\nmisapplication of mechanical genius.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--HOOSAC TUNNEL. Flash-powder photograph of\r\nBurleigh drills at the working face. (_Photo courtesy of State\r\nLibrary, Commonwealth of Massachusetts._)]\r\n\r\nLatrobe stated the basic philosophy of rock-tunnel work. No mechanical\r\nagent has ever been able to improve upon the efficiency of explosives\r\nfor the shattering of rock. For this reason, the logical application\r\nof machinery to tunneling was not in replacing or altering the\r\nfundamental process itself, but in enabling it to be conducted with\r\ngreater speed by mechanically drilling the blasting holes to receive\r\nthe explosive.\r\n\r\nActual work on the Hoosac Tunnel began at both ends of the tunnel in\r\nabout 1854, but without much useful effect until 1858 when a contract\r\nwas let to the renowned civil engineer and railroad builder, Herman\r\nHaupt of Philadelphia. Haupt immediately resumed investigations of\r\nimproved tunneling methods, both full-area machines and mechanical\r\nrock drills. At this time mechanical rock-drill technology was in a\r\nstate beyond, but not far beyond, initial experimentation. There\r\nexisted one workable American machine, the Fowle drill, invented in\r\n1851. It was steam-driven, and had been used in quarry work, although\r\napparently not to any commercial extent. However, it was far too\r\nlarge and cumbersome to find any possible application in tunneling.\r\nNevertheless, it contained in its operating principle, the seed of a\r\npractical rock drill in that the drill rod was attached directly to\r\nand reciprocated by a double-acting steam piston. A point of great\r\nimportance was the independence of its operation on gravity,\r\npermitting drilling in any direction.\r\n\r\nWhile experimenting, Haupt drove the work onward by the classical\r\nmethods, shown in the left-hand section of the model (fig. 2). At\r\nthe far right an advance heading or adit is being formed by pick and\r\nhammer work; this is then deepened into a top heading with enough\r\nheight to permit hammer drilling, actually the basic tunneling\r\noperation. A team is shown \"double jacking,\" i.e., using two-handed\r\nhammers, the steel held by a third man. This was the most efficient of\r\nthe several hand-drilling methods. The top-heading plan was followed\r\nso that the bulk of the rock could be removed in the form of a bottom\r\nbench, and the majority of drilling would be downward, obviously the\r\nmost effective direction. Blasting was with black powder and its\r\ncommercial variants. Some liberty was taken in depicting these steps\r\nso that both operations might be shown within the scope of the model:\r\nin practice the heading was kept between 400 and 600 feet in advance\r\nof the bench so that heading blasts would not interfere with the bench\r\nwork. The bench carriage simply facilitated handling of the blasted\r\nrock. It was rolled back during blasts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--HOOSAC TUNNEL. GROUP OF MINERS descending\r\nthe west shaft with a Burleigh drill. (_Photo courtesy of State\r\nLibrary, Commonwealth of Massachusetts._)]\r\n\r\nThe experiments conducted by Haupt with machine drills produced no\r\nimmediate useful results. A drill designed by Haupt and his associate,\r\nStuart Gwynn, in 1858 bored hard granite at the rate of 5/8 inch per\r\nminute, but was not substantial enough to bear up in service. Haupt\r\nleft the work in 1861, victim of intense political pressures and\r\ntotally unjust accusations of corruption and mismanagement. The\r\nwork was suspended until taken over by a state commission in 1862.\r\nDespite frightful ineptitude and very real corruption, this period\r\nwas exceedingly important in the long history both of Hoosac Tunnel\r\nand of rock tunneling in general.\r\n\r\nThe merely routine criticism of the project had by this time become\r\nviolent due to the inordinate length of time already elapsed and the\r\nimmense cost, compared to the small portion of work completed. This\r\nserved to generate in the commission a strong sense of urgency to\r\nhurry the project along. Charles S. Storrow, a competent engineer, was\r\nsent to Europe to report on the progress of tunneling there, and in\r\nparticular on mechanization at the Mont Cenis Tunnel then under\r\nconstruction between France and Italy. Germain Sommeiller, its chief\r\nengineer, had, after experimentation similar to Haupt's, invented a\r\nreasonably efficient drilling machine which had gone into service at\r\nMont Cenis in March 1861. It was a distinct improvement over hand\r\ndrilling, almost doubling the drilling rate, but was complex and\r\nhighly unreliable. Two hundred drills were required to keep 16 drills\r\nat work. But the vital point in this was the fact that Sommeiller\r\ndrove his drills not with steam, but air, compressed at the tunnel\r\nportals and piped to the work face. It was this single factor, one of\r\napplication rather than invention, that made the mechanical drill\r\nfeasible for tunneling.\r\n\r\nAll previous effort in the field of machine drilling, on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic, had been directed toward steam as the motive power.\r\nIn deep tunnels, with ventilation already an inherent problem, the\r\nexhaust of a steam drill into the atmosphere was inadmissible.\r\nFurther, steam could not be piped over great distances due to serious\r\nlosses of energy from radiation of heat, and condensation. Steam\r\ngeneration within the tunnel itself was obviously out of the question.\r\nIt was the combination of a practical drill, and the parallel\r\ninvention by Sommeiller of a practical air compressor that resulted in\r\nthe first workable application of machine rock drilling to tunneling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figures 8 & 9.--HOOSAC TUNNEL. CONTEMPORARY\r\nENGRAVINGS. As such large general areas could not be sufficiently\r\nilluminated for photography, the Museum model was based primarily on\r\nartists' versions of the work. (_Science Record_, 1872; _Leslie's\r\nWeekly_, 1873.)]\r\n\r\nThe Sommeiller drills greatly impressed Storrow, and his report of\r\nNovember 1862 strongly favored their adoption at Hoosac. It is curious\r\nhowever, that not a single one was brought to the U.S., even on trial.\r\nStorrow does speak of Sommeiller's intent to keep the details of the\r\nmachine to himself until it had been further improved, with a view to\r\nits eventual exploitation. The fact is, that although workable, the\r\nSommeiller drill proved to be a dead end in rock-drill development\r\nbecause of its many basic deficiencies. It did exert the indirect\r\ninfluence of inspiration which, coupled with a pressing need for\r\nhaste, led to renewed trials of drilling machinery at Hoosac. Thomas\r\nDoane, chief engineer under the state commission, carried this program\r\nforth with intensity, seeking and encouraging inventors, and himself\r\nworking on the problem. The pattern of the Sommeiller drill was\r\ngenerally followed; that is, the drill was designed as a separate,\r\nrelatively light mechanical element, adapted for transportation by\r\nseveral miners, and attachable to a movable frame or carriage during\r\noperation. Air was of course the presumed power. To be effective, it\r\nwas necessary that a drill automatically feed the drill rod as the\r\nhole deepened, and also rotate the rod automatically to maintain a\r\nround, smooth hole. Extreme durability was essential, and usually\r\nproved the source of a machine's failure. The combination of these\r\ncharacteristics into a machine capable of driving the drill rod into\r\nthe rock with great force, perhaps five times per second, was a\r\nsevere test of ingenuity and materials. Doane in 1864 had three\r\ndifferent experimental drills in hand, as well as various steam\r\nand water-powered compressors.\r\n\r\nSuccess finally came in 1865 with the invention of a drill by Charles\r\nBurleigh, a mechanical engineer at the well-known Putnam Machine Works\r\nof Fitchburg, Massachusetts. The drills were first applied in the east\r\nheading in June of 1866. Although working well, their initial success\r\nwas limited by lack of reliability and a resulting high expense for\r\nrepairs. They were described as having \"several weakest points.\" In\r\nNovember, these drills were replaced by an improved Burleigh drill\r\nwhich was used with total success to the end of the work. The era of\r\nmodern rock tunneling was thus launched by Sommeiller's insight in\r\ninitially applying pneumatic power to a machine drill, by Doane's\r\npersistence in searching for a thoroughly practical drill, and by\r\nBurleigh's mechanical talent in producing one. The desperate need to\r\ncomplete the Hoosac Tunnel may reasonably be considered the greatest\r\nsingle spur to the development of a successful drill.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this invention was far reaching. Burleigh's was\r\nthe first practical mechanical rock drill in America and, in view of\r\nits dependability, efficiency, and simplicity when compared to the\r\nSommeiller drill, perhaps in the world. The Burleigh drill achieved\r\nsuccess almost immediately. It was placed in production by Putnam for\r\nthe Burleigh Rock Drill Company before completion of Hoosac in 1876,\r\nand its use spread throughout the western mining regions and other\r\ntunnel works. For a major invention, its adoption was, in relative\r\nterms, instantaneous. It was the prototype of all succeeding\r\npiston-type drills, which came to be known generically as \"burleighs,\"\r\nregardless of manufacture. Walter Shanley, the Canadian contractor who\r\nultimately completed the Hoosac, reported in 1870, after the drills\r\nhad been in service for a sufficient time that the techniques for\r\ntheir most efficient use were fully understood and effectively\r\napplied, that the Burleigh drills saved about half the drilling costs\r\nover hand drilling. The per-inch cost of machine drilling averaged 5.5\r\ncents, all inclusive, vs. 11.2 cents for handwork. The more important\r\npoint, that of speed, is shown by the reports of average monthly\r\nprogress of the tunnel itself, before and after use of the air drills.\r\n\r\n  _Year_     _Average monthly\r\n              progress in feet_\r\n\r\n  1865              55\r\n  1866              48\r\n  1867              99\r\n  1868              --\r\n  1869             138\r\n  1870             126\r\n  1871             145\r\n  1872             124\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--TRINITROGLYCERINE BLAST at Hoosac Tunnel.\r\n(_Leslie's Weekly_, 1873.)]\r\n\r\nThe right portion of the model (fig. 3) represents the workings during\r\nthe final period. The bottom heading system was generally used after\r\nthe Burleigh drills had been introduced. Four to six drills were\r\nmounted on a carriage designed by Doane. These drove the holes for\r\nthe first blast in the center of the heading in about six hours. The\r\nfull width of the heading, the 24-foot width of the tunnel, was then\r\ndrilled and blasted out in two more stages. As in the early section,\r\nthe benches to the rear were later removed to the full-tunnel height\r\nof about 20 feet. This operation is shown by a single drill (fig. 4)\r\nmounted on a screw column. Three 8-hour shifts carried the work\r\nforward: drilling occupied half the time and half was spent in running\r\nthe carriage back, blasting, and mucking (clearing the broken rock).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--HOOSAC TUNNEL survey crew at engineering\r\noffice. The highest accuracy of the aboveground and underground survey\r\nwork was required to insure proper vertical and horizontal alignment\r\nand meeting of the several separately driven sections. (_Photo\r\ncourtesy of State Library, Commonwealth of Massachusetts._)]\r\n\r\nThe tunnel's 1028-foot central shaft, completed under the Shanley\r\ncontract in 1870 to provide two additional work faces as well as a\r\nventilation shaft is shown at the far right side of this half of the\r\nmodel. Completed so near the end of the project, only 15 percent of\r\nthe tunnel was driven from the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe enormous increase in rate of progress was not due entirely to\r\nmachine drilling. From the outset of his jurisdiction, Doane undertook\r\nexperiments with explosives as well as drills, seeking an agent more\r\neffective than black powder. In this case, the need for speed was not\r\nthe sole stimulus. As the east and west headings advanced further and\r\nfurther from the portals, the problem of ventilation grew more acute,\r\nand it became increasingly difficult to exhaust the toxic fumes\r\nproduced by the black powder blasts.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Doane imported from Europe a sample of trinitroglycerine,\r\nthe liquid explosive newly introduced by Nobel, known in Europe as\r\n\"glonoïn oil\" and in the United States as \"nitroglycerine.\" It already\r\nhad acquired a fearsome reputation from its tendency to decompose with\r\nheat and age and to explode with or without the slightest provocation.\r\nNevertheless, its tremendous power and characteristic of almost\r\ncomplete smokelessness led Doane to employ the chemist George W.\r\nMowbray, who had blasted for Drake in the Pennsylvania oil fields, to\r\ndevelop techniques for the bulk manufacture of the new agent and for\r\nits safe employment in the tunnel.\r\n\r\nMowbray established a works on the mountain and shortly developed\r\na completely new blasting practice based on the explosive. Its\r\nstability was greatly increased by maintaining absolute purity in the\r\nmanufacturing process. Freezing the liquid to reduce its sensitivity\r\nduring transport to the headings, and extreme caution in its handling\r\nfurther reduced the hazard of its use. At the heading, the liquid was\r\npoured into cylindrical cartridges for placement in the holes. As with\r\nthe Burleigh drill, the general adoption of nitroglycerine was\r\nimmediate once its qualities had been demonstrated. The effect on the\r\nwork was notable. Its explosive characteristics permitted fewer blast\r\nholes over a given frontal area of working face, and at the same time\r\nit was capable of effectively blowing from a deeper drill hole, 42\r\ninches against 30 inches for black powder, so that under ideal\r\nconditions 40 percent more tunnel length was advanced per cycle of\r\noperations. A new fuse and a system of electric ignition were\r\ndeveloped which permitted simultaneous detonation and resulted\r\nin a degree of effectiveness impossible with the powder train and\r\ncord fusing used with the black powder. Over a million pounds of\r\nnitroglycerine were produced by Mowbray between 1866 and completion\r\nof the tunnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--WORKS AT THE CENTRAL SHAFT, HOOSAC TUNNEL,\r\nfor hoisting, pumping and air compressing machinery, and general\r\nrepair, 1871.

(_Photo\r\ncourtesy of State Library, Commonwealth of Massachusetts._)]\r\n\r\nWhen the Shanleys took the work over in 1868, following political\r\ndifficulties attending operation by the State, the period of\r\nexperimentation was over. The tunnel was being advanced by totally\r\nmodern methods, and to the present day the overall concepts have\r\nremained fundamentally unaltered: the Burleigh piston drill has been\r\nreplaced by the lighter hammer drill; the Doane drill carriage by the\r\nmore flexible \"jumbo\"; nitroglycerine by its more stable descendant\r\ndynamite and its alternatives; and static-electric blasting machines\r\nby more dependable magnetoelectric. But these are all in the nature of\r\nimprovements, not innovations.\r\n\r\nUnlike the preceding model, there was good documentation for this one.\r\nAlso, the Hoosac was apparently the first American tunnel to be well\r\nrecorded photographically. Early flashlight views exist of the drills\r\nworking at the heading (fig. 6) as well as of the portals, the winding\r\nand pumping works at the central shaft, and much of the machinery and\r\nassociated aspects of the project. These and copies of drawings of\r\nmuch of Doane's experimental apparatus, a rare technological record,\r\nare preserved at the Massachusetts State Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoft-Ground Tunneling\r\n\r\n\r\nSo great is the difference between hard-rock and soft-ground tunneling\r\nthat they constitute two almost separate branches of the field. In\r\npenetrating ground lacking the firmness or cohesion to support itself\r\nabove an opening, the miner's chief concern is not that of removing\r\nthe material, but of preventing its collapse into his excavation. The\r\nprimitive methods depending upon brute strength and direct application\r\nof fire and human force were suitable for assault on rock, but lacked\r\nthe artifice needed for delving into less stable material. Roman\r\nengineers were accomplished in spanning subterranean ways with masonry\r\narches, but apparently most of their work was done by cut-and-cover\r\nmethods rather than by actual mining.\r\n\r\nNot until the Middle Ages did the skill of effectively working\r\nopenings in soft ground develop, and not until the Renaissance\r\nwas this development so consistently successful that it could\r\nbe considered a science.\r\n\r\n\r\nRENAISSANCE MINING\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest periods of rock working, the quest for minerals\r\nand metals was the primary force that drove men underground. It was\r\nthe technology of mining, the product of slow evolution over the\r\ncenturies, that became the technology of the early tunnel, with no\r\nsignificant modification except in size of workings.\r\n\r\nEvery aspect of 16th century mining is definitively detailed in\r\nGeorgius Agricola's remarkable _De re Metallica_, first published in\r\nBasel in 1556. During its time of active influence, which extended\r\nfor two centuries, it served as the authoritative work on the subject.\r\nIt remains today an unparalleled early record of an entire branch\r\nof technology. The superb woodcuts of mine workings and tools in\r\nthemselves constitute a precise description of the techniques of the\r\nperiod, and provided an ideal source of information upon which to base\r\nthe first model in the soft-ground series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--CENTERING FOR PLACEMENT OF FINISHED\r\nSTONEWORK at west portal, 1874. At top-right are the sheds where\r\nthe lining brick was produced. (_Photo courtesy of State Library,\r\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts._)]\r\n\r\nThe model, representing a typical European mine, demonstrates the\r\nearly use of timber frames or \"sets\" to support the soft material of\r\nthe walls and roof. In areas of only moderate instability, the sets\r\nalone were sufficient to counteract the earth pressure, and were\r\nspaced according to the degree of support required. In more extreme\r\nconditions, a solid lagging of small poles or boards was set outside\r\nthe frames, as shown in the model, to provide absolute support of the\r\nground. Details of the framing, the windlass, and all tools and\r\nappliances were supplied by Agricola, with no need for interpretation\r\nor interpolation.\r\n\r\nThe basic framing pattern of sill, side posts and cap piece, all\r\nmorticed together, with lagging used where needed, was translated\r\nunaltered into tunneling practice, particularly in small exploratory\r\ndrifts. It remained in this application until well into the 20th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe pressure exerted upon tunnels of large area was countered during\r\nconstruction by timbering systems of greater elaboration, evolved\r\nfrom the basic one. By the time that tunnels of section large\r\nenough to accommodate canals and railways were being undertaken as\r\nmatter-of-course civil engineering works, a series of nationally\r\ndistinguishable systems had emerged, each possessing characteristic\r\npoints of favor and fault. As might be suspected, the English system\r\nof tunnel timbering, for instance, was rarely applied on the\r\nContinent, nor were the German, Austrian or Belgian systems normally\r\nseen in Great Britain. All were used at one time or another in this\r\ncountry, until the American system was introduced in about 1855.\r\nWhile the timbering commonly remained in place in mines, it would be\r\nfollowed up by permanent masonry arching and lining in tunnel work.\r\n\r\nOverhead in the museum Hall of Civil Engineering are frames\r\nrepresenting the English, Austrian and American systems. Nearby, a\r\nseries of small relief models (fig. 19) is used to show the sequence\r\nof enlargement in a soft-ground railroad tunnel of about 1855, using\r\nthe Austrian system. Temporary timber support of tunnels fell from use\r\ngradually after the advent of shield tunneling in conjunction with\r\ncast-iron lining. This formed a perfect support immediately behind the\r\nshield, as well as the permanent lining of the tunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUNEL'S THAMES TUNNEL\r\n\r\nThe interior surfaces of tunnels through ground merely unstable are\r\namenable to support by various systems of timbering and arching. This\r\nbecomes less true as the fluidity of the ground increases. The soft\r\nmaterial which normally comprises the beds of rivers can approach an\r\nalmost liquid condition resulting in a hydraulic head from the\r\noverbearing water sufficient to prevent the driving of even the most\r\ncarefully worked drift, supported by simple timbering. The basic\r\ndefect of the timbering systems used in mining and tunneling was\r\nthat there was inevitably a certain amount of the face or ceiling\r\nunsupported just previous to setting a frame, or placing over it the\r\nnecessary section of lagging. In mine work, runny soil could, and did,\r\nbreak through such gaps, filling the working. For this reason, there\r\nwere no serious attempts made before 1825 to drive subaqueous tunnels.\r\n\r\nIn that year, work was started on a tunnel under the Thames between\r\nthe Rotherhithe and Wapping sections of London, under guidance of the\r\nalready famous engineer Marc Isambard Brunel (1769-1849), father of\r\nI. K. Brunel. The undertaking is of great interest in that Brunel\r\nemployed an entirely novel apparatus of his own invention to provide\r\ncontinuous and reliable support of the soft water-bearing clay which\r\nformed the riverbed. By means of this \"shield,\" Brunel was able to\r\ndrive the world's first subaqueous tunnel.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--WEST PORTAL UPON COMPLETION, 1876.\r\n(_Photo courtesy of New-York Historical Society._)]\r\n\r\nThe shield was of cast-iron, rectangular in elevation, and was\r\npropelled forward by jackscrews. Shelves at top, bottom, and sides\r\nsupported the tunnel roof, floor, and walls until the permanent brick\r\nlining was placed. The working face, the critical area, was supported\r\nby a large number of small \"breasting boards,\" held against the ground\r\nby small individual screws bearing against the shield framework. The\r\nshield itself was formed of 12 separate frames, each of which could be\r\nadvanced independently of the others. The height was 22 feet 3 inches:\r\nthe width 37 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\nThe progress was piecemeal. In operation the miners would remove one\r\nbreasting board at a time, excavate in front of it, and then replace\r\nit in the advanced position--about 6 inches forward. This was repeated\r\nwith the next board above or below, and the sequence continued until\r\nthe ground for the entire height of one of the 12 sections had been\r\nremoved. The board screws for that section were shifted to bear on the\r\nadjacent frames, relieving the frame of longitudinal pressure. It\r\ncould then be screwed forward by the amount of advance, the screws\r\nbearing to the rear on the completed masonry. Thus, step by step the\r\ntunnel progressed slowly, the greatest weekly advance being 14 feet.\r\n\r\nIn the left-hand portion of the model is the shaft sunk to begin\r\noperations; here also is shown the bucket hoist for removing the\r\nspoil. The V-type steam engine powering the hoist was designed by\r\nBrunel. At the right of the main model is an enlarged detail of the\r\nshield, actually an improved version built in 1835.\r\n\r\nThe work continued despite setbacks of every sort. The financial ones\r\nneed no recounting here. Technically, although the shield principle\r\nproved workable, the support afforded was not infallible. Four or five\r\ntimes the river broke through the thin cover of silt and flooded\r\nthe workings, despite the utmost caution in excavating. When this\r\noccurred, masses of clay, sandbags, and mats were dumped over the\r\nopening in the riverbed to seal it, and the tunnel pumped out. I. K.\r\nBrunel acted as superintendent and nearly lost his life on a number of\r\noccasions. After several suspensions of work resulting from withdrawal\r\nor exhaustion of support, one lasting seven years, the work was\r\ncompleted in 1843.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that Brunel had, for the first time, demonstrated a\r\npractical method for tunneling in firm and water-bearing ground, the\r\nenormous cost of the work and the almost overwhelming problems\r\nencountered had a discouraging effect rather than otherwise. Not for\r\nanother quarter of a century was a similar project undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe Thames Tunnel was used for foot and light highway traffic until\r\nabout 1870 when it was incorporated into the London Underground\r\nrailway system, which it continues to serve today. The roofed-over\r\ntop sections of the two shafts may still be seen from the river.\r\n\r\nA number of contemporary popular accounts of the tunnel exist, but one\r\nof the most thorough and interesting expositions on a single tunnel\r\nwork of any period is Henry Law's _A Memoir of the Thames Tunnel_,\r\npublished in 1845-1846 by John Weale. Law, an eminent civil engineer,\r\ncovers the work in incredible detail from its inception until the\r\nmajor suspension in late 1828 when slightly more than half completed.\r\nThe most valuable aspect of his record is a series of plates of\r\nengineering drawings of the shield and its components, which, so\r\nfar as is known, exist nowhere else. These formed the basis of the\r\nenlarged section of the shield, shown to the right of the model of the\r\ntunnel itself. A vertical section through the shield is reproduced\r\nhere from Law for comparison with the model (figs. 21 and 23).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--SOFT-GROUND TUNNELING.

MHT model--1/4\" scale.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 49260-F.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWER SUBWAY\r\n\r\nVarious inventors attempted to improve upon the Brunel shield, aware\r\nof the fundamental soundness of the shield principle. Almost all\r\nbypassed the rectangular sectional construction used in the Thames\r\nTunnel, and took as a starting point a sectional shield of circular\r\ncross section, advanced by Brunel in his original patent of 1818.\r\nJames Henry Greathead (1844-1896), rightfully called the father of\r\nmodern subaqueous tunneling, surmised in later years that Brunel had\r\nchosen a rectangular configuration for actual use, as one better\r\nadapted to the sectional type of shield. The English civil engineer,\r\nPeter W. Barlow, in 1864 and 1868 patented a circular shield, of one\r\npiece, which was the basis of one used by him in constructing a small\r\nsubway of 1350 feet beneath the Thames in 1869, the first work to\r\nfollow the lead of Brunel. Greathead, acting as Barlow's contractor,\r\nwas the designer of the shield actually used in the work, but it was\r\nobviously inspired by Barlow's patents.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the multiplicity of parts in the Brunel shield to\r\na single rigid unit was of immense advantage and an advance perhaps\r\nequal to the shield concept of tunneling itself. The Barlow-Greathead\r\nshield was like the cap of a telescope with a sharpened circular ring\r\non the front to assist in penetrating the ground. The diaphragm\r\nfunctioned, as did Brunel's breasting boards, to resist the\r\nlongitudinal earth pressure of the face, and the cylindrical portion\r\nbehind the diaphragm bore the radial pressure of roof and walls. Here\r\nalso for the first time, a permanent lining formed of cast-iron\r\nsegments was used, a second major advancement in soft-ground tunneling\r\npractice. Not only could the segments be placed and bolted together\r\nfar more rapidly than masonry lining could be laid up, but unlike the\r\ngreen masonry, they could immediately bear the full force of the\r\nshield-propelling screws.\r\n\r\nBarlow, capitalizing on Brunel's error in burrowing so close to the\r\nriverbed, maintained an average cover of 30 feet over the tunnel,\r\ndriving through a solid stratum of firm London clay which was\r\nvirtually impervious to water. As the result of this, combined with\r\nthe advantages of the solid shield and the rapidly placed iron lining,\r\nthe work moved forward at a pace and with a facility in startling\r\ncontrast to that of the Thames Tunnel, although in fairness it must be\r\nrecalled that the face area was far less.\r\n\r\nThe clay was found sufficiently sound that it could be readily\r\nexcavated without the support of the diaphragm, and normally three\r\nminers worked in front of the shield, digging out the clay and passing\r\nit back through a doorway in the plate. This could be closed in case\r\nof a sudden settlement or break in. Following excavation, the shield\r\nwas advanced 18 inches into the excavated area by means of 6 screws,\r\nand a ring of lining segments 18 inches in length bolted to the\r\nprevious ring under cover of the overlapping rear skirt of the shield.\r\nThe small annular space left between the outside of the lining and the\r\nclay by the thickness and clearance of the skirt--about an inch--was\r\nfilled with thin cement grout. The tunnel was advanced 18 inches\r\nduring each 8-hour shift. The work continued around the clock, and the\r\n900-foot river section was completed in only 14 weeks.[4] The entire\r\nwork was completed almost without incident in just under a year, a\r\nremarkable performance for the world's second subaqueous tunnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--ENLARGED DETAIL of Brunel's tunneling\r\nshield, vertical section.

Inspection of\r\nthe damage with a diving bell. (BEAMISH, _A Memoir of the Life of Sir\r\nMarc Isambard Brunel_.)]\r\n\r\nThe Tower Subway at first operated with cylindrical cars that nearly\r\nfilled the 7-foot bore; the cars were drawn by cables powered by small\r\nsteam engines in the shafts. This mode of power had previously been\r\nused in passenger service only on the Greenwich Street elevated\r\nrailway in New York. Later the cars were abandoned as unprofitable and\r\nthe tunnel turned into a footway (fig. 32). This small tunnel, the\r\nsuccessful driving due entirely to Greathead's skill, was the\r\nforerunner of the modern subaqueous tunnel. In it, two of the three\r\nelements essential to such work thereafter were first applied: the\r\none-piece movable shield of circular section, and the segmental\r\ncast-iron lining.\r\n\r\nThe documentation of this work is far thinner than for the Thames\r\nTunnel. The most accurate source of technical information is a brief\r\nhistorical account in Copperthwaite's classic _Tunnel Shields and the\r\nUse of Compressed Air in Subaqueous Works_, published in 1906.\r\nCopperthwaite, a successful tunnel engineer, laments the fact that he\r\nwas able to turn up no drawing or original data on this first shield\r\nof Greathead's, but he presents a sketch of it prepared in the\r\nGreathead office in 1895, which is presumably a fair representation\r\n(fig. 33). The Tower Subway model was built on the basis of this and\r\nseveral woodcuts of the working area that appeared contemporaneously\r\nin the illustrated press. In this and the adjacent model of Beach's\r\nBroadway Subway, the tunnel axis has been placed on an angle to the\r\nviewer, projecting the bore into the case so that the complete circle\r\nof the working face is included for a more suggestive effect. This was\r\npossible because of the short length of the work included.\r\n\r\nHenry S. Drinker, also a tunnel engineer and author of the most\r\ncomprehensive work on tunneling ever published, treats rock tunneling\r\nin exhaustive detail up to 1878. His notice of what he terms\r\n\"submarine tunneling\" is extremely brief. He does, however, draw a\r\nmost interesting comparison between the first Thames Tunnel, built by\r\nBrunel, and the second, built by Greathead 26 years later:\r\n\r\n    FIRST THAMES TUNNEL             SECOND THAMES TUNNEL\r\n                                     (TOWER SUBWAY)\r\n\r\n  Brickwork lining, 38 feet       Cast-iron lining of 8 feet\r\n  wide by 22-1/2 feet high.       outside diameter.\r\n\r\n  120-ton cast-iron shield,       2-1/2-ton, wrought-iron shield,\r\n  accommodating 36 miners.        accommodating at most 3 men.\r\n\r\n  Workings filled by irruption   \"Water encountered at almost\r\n  of river five times.            any time could have been\r\n                                  gathered in a stable pail.\"\r\n\r\n  Eighteen years elapsed between  Work completed in about\r\n  start and finish of work.       eleven months.\r\n\r\n  Cost: $3,000,000.

MHT model--1-1/2\" scale. (Smithsonian photo 49260-B.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBEACH'S BROADWAY SUBWAY\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the construction of the Tower Subway,\r\nthe first American shield tunnel was driven by Alfred Ely Beach\r\n(1826-1896). Beach, as editor of the _Scientific American_ and\r\ninventor of, among other things, a successful typewriter as early as\r\n1856, was well known and respected in technical circles. He was not\r\na civil engineer, but had become concerned with New York's pressing\r\ntraffic problem (even then) and as a solution, developed plans for a\r\nrapid-transit subway to extend the length of Broadway. He invented a\r\nshield as an adjunct to this system, solely to permit driving of the\r\ntunnel without disturbing the overlying streets.\r\n\r\nAn active patent attorney as well, Beach must certainly have known of\r\nand studied the existing patents for tunneling shields, which were,\r\nwithout exception, British. In certain aspects his shield resembled\r\nthe one patented by Barlow in 1864, but never built. However, work on\r\nthe Beach tunnel started in 1869, so close in time to that on the\r\nTower Subway, that it is unlikely that there was any influence from\r\nthat source. Beach had himself patented a shield, in June 1869, a\r\ntwo-piece, sectional design that bore no resemblance to the one used.\r\nHis subway plan had been first introduced at the 1867 fair of the\r\nAmerican Institute in the form of a short plywood tube through which\r\na small, close-fitting car was blown by a fan. The car carried 12\r\npassengers. Sensing opposition to the subway scheme from Tammany, in\r\n1868 Beach obtained a charter to place a small tube beneath Broadway\r\nfor transporting mail and small packages pneumatically, a plan he\r\nadvocated independently of the passenger subway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--CONTEMPORARY ILLUSTRATIONS of Tower\r\nSubway works used as basis of the model in the Museum of History\r\nand Technology. (_Illustrated London News_, 1869.)\r\n\r\n  ADVANCING THE SHIELD. FITTING THE CASTINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31.--EXCAVATION IN FRONT OF SHIELD, Tower\r\nSubway. This was possible because of the stiffness of the clay\r\nencountered. MHT model--front of model shown in fig. 29.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 49260-A.)]\r\n\r\nUnder this thin pretense of legal authorization, the sub-rosa\r\nexcavation began from the basement of a clothing store on Warren\r\nStreet near Broadway. The 8-foot-diameter tunnel ran eastward a short\r\ndistance, made a 90-degree turn, and thence southward under Broadway\r\nto stop a block away under the south side of Murray Street. The total\r\ndistance was about 312 feet. Work was carried on at night in total\r\nsecrecy, the actual tunneling taking 58 nights. At the Warren Street\r\nterminal, a waiting room was excavated and a large Roots blower\r\ninstalled for propulsion of the single passenger car. The plan was\r\nsimilar to that used with the model in 1867: the cylindrical car\r\nfitted the circular tunnel with only slight circumferential clearance.\r\nThe blower created a plenum within the waiting room and tunnel area\r\nbehind the car of about 0.25 pounds per square inch, resulting in a\r\nthrust on the car of almost a ton, not accounting for blowby. The car\r\nwas thus blown along its course, and was returned by reversing the\r\nblower's suction and discharge ducts to produce an equivalent vacuum\r\nwithin the tunnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32.--INTERIOR OF COMPLETED TOWER SUBWAY.\r\n(THORNBURY, _Old and New London, 1887, vol. 1, p. 126_.)]\r\n\r\nThe system opened in February of 1870 and remained in operation for\r\nabout a year. Beach was ultimately subdued by the hostile influences\r\nof Boss Tweed, and the project was completely abandoned. Within a very\r\nfew more years the first commercially operated elevated line was\r\nbuilt, but the subway did not achieve legitimate status in New York\r\nuntil the opening of the Interborough line in 1904. Ironically, its\r\nroute traversed Broadway for almost the length of the island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33.--VERTICAL SECTION through the Greathead\r\nshield used at the Tower Subway, 1869. The first one-piece shield of\r\ncircular section. (COPPERTHWAITE, _Tunnel Shields and the Use of\r\nCompressed Air in Subaqueous Works_.)]\r\n\r\nThe Beach shield operated with perfect success in this brief trial,\r\nalthough the loose sandy soil encountered was admittedly not a severe\r\ntest of its qualities. No diaphragm was used; instead a series of 8\r\nhorizontal shelves with sharpened leading edges extended across the\r\nfront opening of the shield. The outstanding feature of the machine\r\nwas the substitution for the propelling screws used by Brunel and\r\nGreathead of 18 hydraulic rams, set around its circumference. These\r\nwere fed by a single hand-operated pump, seen in the center of figure\r\n34. By this means the course of the shield's forward movement could be\r\ncontrolled with a convenience and precision not attainable with\r\nscrews. Vertical and horizontal deflection was achieved by throttling\r\nthe supply of water to certain of the rams, which could be\r\nindividually controlled, causing greater pressure on one portion of\r\nthe shield than another. This system has not changed in the ensuing\r\ntime, except, of course, in the substitution of mechanically produced\r\nhydraulic pressure for hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34.--BEACH'S Broadway Subway. Advancing the\r\nshield by hydraulic rams, 1869. MHT model--1-1/2\" scale.

(_Scientific American_, March 5, 1870.)]\r\n\r\nUnlike the driving of the Tower Subway, no excavation was done in\r\nfront of the shield. Rather, the shield was forced by the rams into\r\nthe soil for the length of their stroke, the material which entered\r\nbeing supported by the shelves. This was removed from the shelves and\r\nhauled off. The ram plungers then were withdrawn and a 16-inch length\r\nof the permanent lining built up within the shelter of the shield's\r\ntail ring. Against this, the rams bore for the next advance. Masonry\r\nlining was used in the straight section; cast-iron in the curved. The\r\njuncture is shown in the model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 36.--INTERIOR of Beach Subway showing iron\r\nlining on curved section and the pneumatically powered passenger car.\r\nView from waiting room. (_Scientific American_, March 5, 1870.)]\r\n\r\nEnlarged versions of the Beach shield were used in a few tunnels in\r\nthe Midwest in the early 1870's, but from then until 1886 the shield\r\nmethod, for no clear reason, again entered a period of disuse finding\r\nno application on either side of the Atlantic despite its virtually\r\nunqualified proof at the hands of Greathead and Beach. Little precise\r\ninformation remains on this work. The Beach system of pneumatic\r\ntransit is described fully in a well-illustrated booklet published\r\nby him in January 1868, in which the American Institute model is\r\nshown, and many projected systems of pneumatic propulsion as well\r\nas of subterranean and subaqueous tunneling described. Beach again\r\n(presumably) is author of the sole contemporary account of the\r\nBroadway Subway, which appeared in _Scientific American_ following its\r\nopening early in 1870. Included are good views of the tunnel and car,\r\nof the shield in operation, and, most important, a vertical sectional\r\nview through the shield (fig. 35).\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that optical surveys for maintenance of the\r\ncourse apparently were not used. The article illustrated and described\r\nthe driving each night of a jointed iron rod up through the tunnel\r\nroof to the street, twenty or so feet above, for \"testing the\r\nposition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST HUDSON RIVER TUNNEL\r\n\r\nDespite the ultimate success of Brunel's Thames Tunnel in 1843, the\r\nshield in that case afforded only moderately reliable protection\r\nbecause of the fluidity of the soil driven through, and its tendency\r\nto enter the works through the smallest opening in the shield's\r\ndefense. An English doctor who had made physiological studies of the\r\neffects on workmen of the high air pressure within diving bells is\r\nsaid to have recommended to Brunel in 1828 that he introduce an\r\natmosphere of compressed air into the tunnel to exclude the water\r\nand support the work face.\r\n\r\nThis plan was first formally described by Sir Thomas Cochrane\r\n(1775-1860) in a British patent of 1830. Conscious of Brunel's\r\nproblems, he proposed a system of shaft sinking, mining, and tunneling\r\nin water-bearing materials by filling the excavated area with air\r\nsufficiently above atmospheric pressure to prevent the water from\r\nentering and to support the earth. In this, and his description of air\r\nlocks for passage of men and materials between the atmosphere and the\r\npressurized area, Cochrane fully outlined the essential features of\r\npneumatic excavation as developed since.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 37.--THE GIANT ROOTS LOBE-TYPE BLOWER used for\r\npropelling the car.]\r\n\r\nIn 1839, a French engineer first used the system in sinking a mine\r\nshaft through a watery stratum. From then on, the sinking of shafts,\r\nand somewhat later the construction of bridge pier foundations, by the\r\npneumatic method became almost commonplace engineering practice in\r\nEurope and America. Not until 1879 however, was the system tried in\r\ntunneling work, and then, as with the shield ten years earlier, almost\r\nsimultaneously here and abroad. The first application was in a small\r\nriver tunnel in Antwerp, only 5 feet in height. This project was\r\nsuccessfully completed relying on compressed air alone to support the\r\nearth, no shield being used. The importance of the work cannot be\r\nconsidered great due to its lack of scope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 38.--TESTING ALIGNMENT of the Broadway Subway at\r\nnight by driving a jointed rod up to street level. (_Scientific\r\nAmerican_, March 5, 1870.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Dewitt C. Haskin (1822-1900), a west coast mine and railroad\r\nbuilder, became interested in the pneumatic caissons then being used\r\nto found the river piers of Eads' Mississippi River bridge at St.\r\nLouis. In apparent total ignorance of the Cochrane patent, he evolved\r\na similar system for tunneling water-bearing media, and in 1873\r\nproposed construction of a tunnel through the silt beneath the Hudson\r\nto provide rail connection between New Jersey and New York City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 39.--HASKIN'S pneumatically driven tunnel\r\nunder the Hudson River, 1880. In the engine room at top left was the\r\nmachinery for hoisting, generating electricity for lighting, and air\r\ncompressing. The air lock is seen in the wall of the brick shaft.\r\nMHT model--0.3\" scale. (Smithsonian photo 49260.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 40.--ARTIST'S CONCEPTION OF MINERS escaping\r\ninto the air lock during the blowout in Haskin's tunnel.]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine a site more in need of such\r\ncommunication. All lines from the south terminated along the west\r\nshore of the river and the immense traffic--cars, freight and\r\npassengers--was carried across to Manhattan Island by ferry and barge\r\nwith staggering inconvenience and at enormous cost. A bridge would\r\nhave been, and still is, almost out of the question due not only to\r\nthe width of the crossing, but to the flatness of both banks. To\r\nprovide sufficient navigational clearance (without a drawspan),\r\nimpracticably long approaches would have been necessary to obtain\r\na permissibly gentle grade.\r\n\r\nHaskin formed a tunneling company and began work with the sinking of\r\na shaft in Hoboken on the New Jersey side. In a month it was halted\r\nbecause of an injunction by, curiously, the D L & W Railroad, who\r\nfeared for their vast investment in terminal and marine facilities.\r\nNot until November of 1879 was the injunction lifted and work again\r\ncommenced. The shaft was completed and an air lock located in one wall\r\nfrom which the tunnel proper was to be carried forward. It was\r\nHaskin's plan to use no shield, relying solely on the pressure of\r\ncompressed air to maintain the work faces and prevent the entry of\r\nwater. The air was admitted in late December, and the first\r\nlarge-scale pneumatic tunneling operation launched. A single 26-foot,\r\ndouble-track bore was at first undertaken, but a work face of such\r\ndiameter proved unmanageable and two oval tubes 18 feet high by 16\r\nfeet wide were substituted, each to carry a single track. Work went\r\nforward with reasonable facility, considering the lack of precedent.\r\nA temporary entrance was formed of sheet-iron rings from the air lock\r\ndown to the tunnel grade, at which point the permanent work of the\r\nnorth tube was started. Immediately behind the excavation at the face,\r\na lining of thin wrought-iron plates was built up, to provide form for\r\nthe 2-foot, permanent brick lining that followed. The three stages are\r\nshown in the model in about their proper relationship of progress. The\r\nwork is shown passing beneath an old timber-crib bulkhead, used for\r\nstabilizing the shoreline.\r\n\r\nThe silt of the riverbed was about the consistency of putty and under\r\ngood conditions formed a secure barrier between the excavation and the\r\nriver above. It was easily excavated, and for removal was mixed with\r\nwater and blown out through a pipe into the shaft by the higher\r\npressure in the tunnel. About half was left in the bore for removal\r\nlater. The basic scheme was workable, but in operation an extreme\r\nprecision was required in regulating the air pressure in the work\r\narea.[5] It was soon found that there existed an 11-psi difference\r\nbetween the pressure of water on the top and the bottom of the working\r\nface, due to the 22-foot height of the unlined opening. Thus, it was\r\nimpossible to maintain perfect pneumatic balance of the external\r\npressure over the entire face. It was necessary to strike an average\r\nwith the result that some water entered at the bottom of the face\r\nwhere the water pressure was greatest, and some air leaked out at the\r\ntop where the water pressure was below the air pressure. Constant\r\nattention was essential: several men did nothing but watch the\r\nbehavior of the leaks and adjusted the pressure as the ground density\r\nchanged with advance. Air was supplied by several steam-driven\r\ncompressors at the surface.\r\n\r\nThe air lock permitted passage back and forth of men and supplies\r\nbetween the atmosphere and the work area, without disturbing the\r\npressure differential. This principle is demonstrated by an animated\r\nmodel set into the main model, to the left of the shaft (fig. 39). The\r\nvariation of pressure within the lock chamber to match the atmosphere\r\nor the pressurized area, depending on the direction of passage, is\r\nclearly shown by simplified valves and gauges, and by the use of light\r\nin varying color density. In the Haskin tunnel, 5 to 10 minutes were\r\ntaken to pass the miners through the lock so as to avoid too abrupt a\r\nphysiological change.\r\n\r\nDespite caution, a blowout occurred in July 1880 due to air leakage\r\nnot at the face, but around the temporary entrance. One door of the\r\nair lock jammed and twenty men drowned, resulting in an inquiry which\r\nbrought forth much of the distrust with which Haskin was regarded by\r\nthe engineering profession. His ability and qualifications were\r\nsubjected to the bitterest attack in and by the technical press. There\r\nis some indication that, although the project began with a staff of\r\ncompetent engineers, they were alienated by Haskin in the course of\r\nwork and at least one withdrew. Haskin's remarks in his own defense\r\nindicate that some of the denunciation was undoubtedly justified. And\r\nyet, despite this reaction, the fundamental merit of the pneumatic\r\ntunneling method had been demonstrated by Haskin and was immediately\r\nrecognized and freely acknowledged. It was apparent at the same time,\r\nhowever, that air by itself did not provide a sufficiently reliable\r\nsupport for large-area tunnel works in unstable ground, and this\r\nremains the only major subaqueous tunnel work driven with air alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 41.--LOCATION OF HUDSON RIVER TUNNEL. (_Leslie's\r\nWeekly_, 1879.)]\r\n\r\nAfter the accident, work continued under Haskin until 1882 when funds\r\nran out. About 1600 feet of the north tube and 600 feet of the south\r\ntube had been completed. Greathead resumed operations with a shield\r\nfor a British company in 1889, but exhaustion of funds again caused\r\nstoppage in 1891. The tunnel was finally completed in 1904, and is\r\nnow in use as part of the Hudson and Manhattan rapid-transit system,\r\nnever providing the sought-after rail link. A splendid document of the\r\nHaskin portion of the work is S. D. V. Burr's _Tunneling Under the\r\nHudson River_ published in 1885. It is based entirely upon firsthand\r\nmaterial and contains drawings of most of the work, including the\r\nauxiliary apparatus. It is interesting to note that electric\r\nillumination (arc, not incandescent, lights) and telephones were used,\r\nunquestionably the first employment of either in tunnel work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 42.--ST. CLAIR TUNNEL. View of front of shield\r\nshowing method of excavation in firm strata. Incandescent electric\r\nillumination was used. 1889-90. MHT model--1\" scale.

CLAIR TUNNEL\r\n\r\nThe final model of the soft-ground series reflects, as did the Hoosac\r\nTunnel model for hard-rock tunneling, final emergence into the modern\r\nperiod. Although the St. Clair Tunnel was completed over 70 years ago,\r\nit typifies in its method of construction, the basic procedures of\r\nsubaqueous work in the present day. The Thames Tunnel of Brunel, and\r\nHaskin's efforts beneath the Hudson, had clearly shown that by\r\nthemselves, both the shield and pneumatic systems of driving through\r\nfluid ground were defective in practice for tunnels of large area.\r\nNote that the earliest successful works by each method had been of\r\nvery small area, so that the influence of adverse conditions was\r\ngreatly diminished.\r\n\r\nThe first man to perceive and seize upon the benefits to be gained by\r\ncombining the two systems was, most fittingly, Greathead. Although he\r\nhad projected the technique earlier, in driving the underground City\r\nand South London Railway in 1886, he brought together for the first\r\ntime the three fundamental elements essential for the practical\r\ntunneling of soft, water-bearing ground: compressed-air support of the\r\nwork during construction, the movable shield, and cast-iron, permanent\r\nlining. The marriage was a happy one indeed; the limitations of each\r\nsystem were almost perfectly overcome by the qualities of the others.\r\n\r\nThe conditions prevailing in 1882 at the Sarnia, Ontario, terminal of\r\nthe Grand Trunk Railway, both operational and physical, were almost\r\nprecisely the same as those which inspired the undertaking of the\r\nHudson River Tunnel. The heavy traffic at this vital U.S.--Canada rail\r\ninterchange was ferried inconveniently across the wide St. Clair\r\nRiver, and the bank and river conditions precluded construction of a\r\nbridge. A tunnel was projected by the railway in that year, the time\r\nwhen Haskin's tribulations were at their height. Perhaps because of\r\nthis lack of precedent for a work of such size, nothing was done\r\nimmediately. In 1884 the railway organized a tunnel company; in 1886\r\ntest borings were made in the riverbed and small exploratory drifts\r\nwere started across from both banks by normal methods of mine\r\ntimbering. The natural gas, quicksand, and water encountered soon\r\nstopped the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 43.--REAR VIEW OF ST. CLAIR SHIELD showing the\r\nerector arm placing a cast-iron lining segment. The three motions of\r\nthe arm--axial, radial, and rotational, were manually powered.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 49260-C.)]\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the railway's president visited Greathead's\r\nCity and South London workings. The obvious answer to the St. Clair\r\nproblem lay in the successful conduct of this subway. Joseph Hobson,\r\nchief engineer of the Grand Trunk and of the tunnel project, in\r\ndesigning a shield, is said to have searched for drawings of the\r\nshields used in the Broadway and Tower Subways of 1868-9, but unable\r\nto locate any, he relied to a limited extent on the small drawings of\r\nthose in Drinker's volume. There is no explanation as to why he did\r\nnot have drawings of the City and South London shield at that moment\r\nin use, unless one considers the rather unlikely possibility that\r\nGreathead maintained its design in secrecy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 44.--OPENING OF THE ST. CLAIR TUNNEL, 1891.\r\n(_Photo courtesy of Detroit Library, Burton Historical Collection._)]\r\n\r\nThe Hobson shield followed Greathead's as closely as any other, in\r\nhaving a diaphragm with closable doors, but a modification of Beach's\r\nsharpened horizontal shelves was also used. However, these functioned\r\nmore as working platforms than supports for the earth. The machine was\r\n21-1/2 feet in diameter, an unprecedented size and almost twice that\r\nof Greathead's current one. It was driven by 24 hydraulic rams.\r\nThroughout the entire preliminary consideration of the project there\r\nwas a marked sense of caution that amounted to what seems an almost\r\ntotal lack of confidence in success. Commencement of the work from\r\nvertical shafts was planned so that if the tunnel itself failed, no\r\nexpenditure would have been made for approach work. In April 1888,\r\nthe shafts were started near both riverbanks, but before reaching\r\nproper depth the almost fluid clay and silt flowed up faster than it\r\ncould be excavated and this plan was abandoned. After this second\r\ninauspicious start, long open approach cuts were made and the work\r\nfinally began. The portals were established in the cuts, several\r\nthousand feet back from each bank and there the tunneling itself\r\nbegan. The portions under the shore were driven without air. When the\r\nbanks were reached, brick bulkheads containing air locks were built\r\nacross the opening and the section beneath the river, about 3,710 feet\r\nlong, driven under air pressure of 10 to 28 pounds above atmosphere.\r\nFor most of the way, the clay was firm and there was little air\r\nleakage. It was found that horses could not survive in the compressed\r\nair, and so mules were used under the river.\r\n\r\nIn the firm clay, excavation was carried on several feet in front of\r\nthe shield, as shown in the model (fig. 42). About twelve miners\r\nworked at the face. However, in certain strata the clay encountered\r\nwas so fluid that the shield could be simply driven forward by the\r\nrams, causing the muck to flow in at the door openings without\r\nexcavation. After each advance, the rams were retracted and a ring of\r\niron lining segments built up, as in the Tower Subway. Here, for the\r\nfirst time, an \"erector arm\" was used for placing the segments, which\r\nweighed about half a ton. In all respects, the work advanced with\r\nwonderful facility and lack of operational difficulty. Considering\r\nthe large area, no subaqueous tunnel had ever been driven with such\r\nspeed. The average monthly progress for the American and Canadian\r\nheadings totaled 455 feet, and at top efficiency 10 rings or a length\r\nof 15.3 feet could be set in a 24-hour day in each heading. The 6,000\r\nfeet of tunnel was driven in just a year; the two shields met\r\nvis-a-vis in August of 1890.\r\n\r\nThe transition was complete. The work had been closely followed by the\r\ntechnical journals and the reports of its successful accomplishment\r\nthus were brought to the attention of the entire civil engineering\r\nprofession. As the first major subaqueous tunnel completed in America\r\nand the first in the world of a size able to accommodate full-scale\r\nrail traffic, the St. Clair Tunnel served to dispel the doubts\r\nsurrounding such work, and established the pattern for a mode of\r\ntunneling which has since changed only in matters of detail.\r\n\r\nOf the eight models, only this one was built under the positive\r\nguidance of original documents. In the possession of the Canadian\r\nNational Railways are drawings not only of all elements of the shield\r\nand lining, but of much of the auxiliary apparatus used in\r\nconstruction. Such materials rarely survive, and do so in this case\r\nonly because of the foresight of the railway which, to avoid paying a\r\nhigh profit margin to a private contractor as compensation for the\r\nrisk and uncertainty involved, carried the contract itself and,\r\ntherefore, preserved all original drawing records.\r\n\r\nWhile the engineering of tunnels has been comprehensively treated in\r\nthis paper from the historical standpoint, it is well to still reflect\r\nthat the advances made in tunneling have not perceptibly removed the\r\nelements of uncertainty but have only provided more positive and\r\neffective means of countering their forces. Still to be faced are the\r\nsurprises of hidden streams, geologic faults, shifts of strata,\r\nunstable materials, and areas of extreme pressure and temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n  AGRICOLA, GEORGIUS. _De re Metallica._ [English transl.

One of these, of ancient origin, used mainly in the\r\n      construction of shallow subways and utility ways, is the \"cut and\r\n      cover\" system, whereby an open trench is excavated and then roofed\r\n      over. The result is, in effect, a tunnel. The concept of the other\r\n      method was propounded in the early 19th century but only used\r\n      practically in recent years. This is the \"trench\" method, a sort\r\n      of subaqueous equivalent of cut and cover. A trench is dredged in\r\n      the bed of a body of water, into which prefabricated sections of\r\n      large diameter tube are lowered, in a continuous line. The joints\r\n      are then sealed by divers, the trench is backfilled over the tube,\r\n      the ends are brought up to dryland portals, the water is pumped\r\n      out, and a subterranean passage results. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge\r\n      Tunnel (1960-1964) is a recent major work of this character.\r\n\r\n  [2] In 1952 a successful machine was developed on this plan, with\r\n      hardened rollers on a revolving cutting head for disintegrating\r\n      the rock. The idea is basically sound, possessing advantages in\r\n      certain situations over conventional drilling and blasting\r\n      systems.\r\n\r\n  [3] In 1807 the noted Cornish engineer Trevithick commenced a small\r\n      timbered drift beneath the Thames, 5 feet by 3 feet, as an\r\n      exploratory passage for a larger vehicular tunnel. Due to the\r\n      small frontal area, he was able to successfully probe about 1000\r\n      feet, but the river then broke in and halted the work. Mine\r\n      tunnels had also reached beneath the Irish Sea and various rivers\r\n      in the coal regions of Newcastle, but these were so far below the\r\n      surface as to be in perfectly solid ground and can hardly be\r\n      considered subaqueous workings.\r\n\r\n  [4] Unlike the Brunel tunnel, this was driven from both ends\r\n      simultaneously, the total overall progress thus being 3 feet per\r\n      shift rather than 18 inches. A top speed of 9 feet per day could\r\n      be advanced by each shield under ideal conditions.\r\n\r\n  [5] Ideally, the pressure of air within the work area of a\r\n      pneumatically driven tunnel should just balance the hydrostatic\r\n      head of the water without, which is a function of its total height\r\n      above the opening. If the air pressure is not high enough, water\r\n      will, of course, enter, and if very low, there is danger of\r\n      complete collapse of the unsupported ground areas. If too high,\r\n      the air pressure will overcome that due to the water and the air\r\n      will force its way out through the ground, through increasingly\r\n      larger openings, until it all rushes out suddenly in a \"blowout.\"\r\n      The pressurized atmosphere gone, the water then is able to pour\r\n      in through the same opening, flooding the workings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTRIBUTIONS FROM\r\n  THE MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY:\r\n\r\n  PAPER 42\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE \"PIONEER\": LIGHT PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE OF 1851\r\n  IN THE MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY\r\n\r\n  _John H.

This\r\n    locomotive is a true representation of a light passenger\r\n    locomotive of 1851 and a historic relic of the mid-nineteenth\r\n    century._\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR: _John H. White is associate curator of\r\n    transportation in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of\r\n    History and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"PIONEER\" is an unusual locomotive and on first inspection would\r\nseem to be imperfect for service on an American railroad of the 1850's.\r\nThis locomotive has only one pair of driving wheels and no truck, an\r\narrangement which marks it as very different from the highly successful\r\nstandard 8-wheel engine of this period. All six wheels of the _Pioneer_\r\nare rigidly attached to the frame. It is only half the size of an\r\n8-wheel engine of 1851 and about the same size of the 4--2--0 so common\r\nin this country some 20 years earlier. Its general arrangement is that\r\nof the rigid English locomotive which had, years earlier, proven\r\nunsuitable for use on U.S. railroads.\r\n\r\nThese objections are more apparent than real, for the _Pioneer_, and\r\nother engines of the same design, proved eminently successful when used\r\nin the service for which they were built, that of light passenger\r\ntraffic. The _Pioneer's_ rigid wheelbase is no problem, for when it is\r\ncompared to that of an 8-wheel engine it is found to be about four feet\r\nless; and its small size is no problem when we realize it was not\r\nintended for heavy service. Figure 2, a diagram, is a comparison of the\r\n_Pioneer_ and a standard 8-wheel locomotive.\r\n\r\nSince the service life of the _Pioneer_ was spent on the Cumberland\r\nValley Railroad, a brief account of that line is necessary to an\r\nunderstanding of the service history of this locomotive.\r\n\r\n    _Exhibits of the \"Pioneer\"_\r\n\r\n    The _Pioneer_ has been a historic relic since 1901. In the fall\r\n    of that year minor repairs were made to the locomotive so that\r\n    it might be used in the sesquicentennial celebration at\r\n    Carlisle, Pennsylvania. On October 22, 1901, the engine was\r\n    ready for service, but as it neared Carlisle a copper flue\r\n    burst. The fire was extinguished and the _Pioneer_ was pushed\r\n    into town by another engine. In the twentieth century, the\r\n    _Pioneer_ was displayed at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,\r\n    St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904, and at the Wheeling, West\r\n    Virginia, semicentennial in 1913. In 1927 it joined many other\r\n    historic locomotives at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's \"Fair\r\n    of the Iron Horse\" which commemorated the first one hundred\r\n    years of that company. From about 1913 to 1925 the _Pioneer_\r\n    also appeared a number of times at the Apple-blossom Festival\r\n    at Winchester, Virginia. In 1933-1934 it was displayed at the\r\n    World's Fair in Chicago, and in 1948 at the Railroad Fair in the\r\n    same city. Between 1934 and March 1947 it was exhibited at the\r\n    Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cumberland Valley Railroad\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cumberland Valley Railroad (C.V.R.R.) was chartered on April 2,\r\n1831, to connect the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers by a railroad\r\nthrough the Cumberland Valley in south-central Pennsylvania. The\r\nCumberland Valley, with its rich farmland and iron-ore deposits, was a\r\nnatural north-south route long used as a portage between these two\r\nrivers. Construction began in 1836, and because of the level valley some\r\n52 miles of line was completed between Harrisburg and Chambersburg by\r\nNovember 16, 1837. In 1860, by way of the Franklin Railroad, the line\r\nextended to Hagerstown, Maryland. It was not until 1871 that the\r\nCumberland Valley Railroad reached its projected southern terminus, the\r\nPotomac River, by extending to Powells Bend, Maryland. Winchester,\r\nVirginia, was entered in 1890 giving the Cumberland Valley Railroad\r\nabout 165 miles of line. The railroad which had become associated with\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad in 1859, was merged with that company in 1919.\r\n\r\nBy 1849 the Cumberland Valley Railroad was in poor condition; the\r\nstrap-rail track was worn out and new locomotives were needed. Captain\r\nDaniel Tyler was hired to supervise rebuilding the line with T-rail, and\r\neasy grades and curves. Tyler recommended that a young friend of his,\r\nAlba F. Smith, be put in charge of modernizing and acquiring new\r\nequipment. Smith recommended to the railroad's Board of Managers on June\r\n25, 1851, that \"much lighter engines than those now in use may be\r\nsubstituted for the passenger transportation and thereby effect a great\r\nsaving both in point of fuel and road repairs....\"[1] Smith may well\r\nhave gone on to explain that the road was operating 3- and 4-car\r\npassenger trains with a locomotive weighing about 20 tons; the total\r\nweight was about 75 tons, equalling the uneconomical deadweight of 1200\r\npounds per passenger. Since speed was not an important consideration (30\r\nmph being a good average), the use of lighter engines would improve the\r\ndeadweight-to-passenger ratio and would not result in a slower schedule.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Managers agreed with Smith's recommendations and instructed\r\nhim \"... to examine the two locomotives lately built by Mr. Wilmarth\r\nand now in the [protection?] of Captain Tyler at Norwich and if in his\r\njudgment they are adequate to our wants ... have them forwarded to the\r\nroad.\"[2] Smith inspected the locomotives not long after this resolution\r\nwas passed, for they were on the road by the time he made the following\r\nreport[3] to the Board on September 24, 1851:\r\n\r\n    In accordance with a resolution passed at the last meeting of\r\n    your body relative to the small engines built by Mr. Wilmarth I\r\n    proceeded to Norwich to make trial of their capacity--fitness or\r\n    suitability to the Passenger transportation of our Road--and\r\n    after as thorough a trial as circumstances would admit (being on\r\n    another Road than our own) I became satisfied that with some\r\n    necessary improvements which would not be expensive (and are now\r\n    being made at our shop) the engines would do the business of\r\n    our Road not only in a manner satisfactory in point of speed and\r\n    certainty but with greater ultimate economy in Expenses than has\r\n    before been practised in this Country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--DIAGRAM COMPARING the _Pioneer_ (shaded\r\ndrawing) with the _Columbia_, a standard 8-wheel engine of 1851.\r\n(Drawing by J.

I therefore leave the matter until further called\r\n    upon.\r\n\r\n    The Expenses necessarily incurred by the trial of the Engines\r\n    and also the Expenses of transporting the same are not included\r\n    in the Statement herewith presented, the whole amount of which\r\n    will not probably exceed $400.00.\r\n\r\nThese two locomotives became the Cumberland Valley Railroad's _Pioneer_\r\n(number 13) and _Jenny Lind_ (number 14). While Smith notes that one of\r\nthe engines was damaged during the inspection trials, Joseph Winters, an\r\nemployee of the Cumberland Valley who claimed he was accompanying the\r\nengine enroute to Chambersburg at the time of their delivery, later\r\nrecalled that both engines were damaged in transit.[4] According to\r\nWinters a train ran into the rear of the _Jenny Lind_, damaging both it\r\nand the _Pioneer_, the accident occurring near Middletown, Pennsylvania.\r\nThe _Jenny Lind_ was repaired at Harrisburg but the _Pioneer_, less\r\nseriously damaged, was taken for repairs to the main shops of the\r\nCumberland Valley road at Chambersburg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--\"PIONEER,\" ABOUT 1901, showing the sandbox and\r\nlarge headlamp. Note the lamp on the cab roof, now used as the\r\nheadlight. (Smithsonian photo 49272.)]\r\n\r\nWhile there seems little question that these locomotives were not built\r\nas a direct order for the Cumberland Valley Railroad, an article[5]\r\nappearing in the _Railroad Advocate_ in 1855 credits their design to\r\nSmith. The article speaks of a 2--2--4 built for the Macon and Western\r\nRailroad and says in part:\r\n\r\n    This engine is designed and built very generally upon the ideas,\r\n    embodied in some small tank engines designed by A. F. Smith,\r\n    Esq., for the Cumberland Valley road. Mr. Smith is a strong\r\n    advocate of light engines, and his novel style and proportions\r\n    of engines, as built for him a few years since, by Seth\r\n    Wilmarth, at Boston, are known to some of our readers. Without\r\n    knowing all the circumstances under which these engines are\r\n    worked on the Cumberland Valley road, we should not venture to\r\n    repeat all that we have heard of their performances, it is\r\n    enough to say that they are said to do more, in proportion to\r\n    their weight, than any other engines now in use.\r\n\r\nThe author believes that the _Railroad Advocate's_ claim of Smith's\r\ndesign of the _Pioneer_ has been confused with his design of the\r\n_Utility_ (figs. 6, 7). Smith designed this compensating-lever engine to\r\nhaul trains over the C.V.R.R. bridge at Harrisburg. It was built by\r\nWilmarth in 1854.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--MAP OF THE CUMBERLAND VALLEY Railroad as it\r\nappeared in 1919.]\r\n\r\nAccording to statements of Smith and the Board of Managers quoted on\r\npage 244, the _Pioneer_ and the _Jenny Lind_ were not new when purchased\r\nfrom their maker, Seth Wilmarth. Although of recent manufacture,\r\nprevious to June 1851, they were apparently doing service on a road in\r\nNorwich, Connecticut. It should be mentioned that both Smith and Tyler\r\nwere formerly associated with the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and\r\nthey probably learned of these two engines through this former\r\nassociation. It is possible that the engines were purchased from\r\nWilmarth by the Cumberland Valley road, which had bought several other\r\nlocomotives from Wilmarth in previous years. It was the practice of at\r\nleast one other New England engine builder, the Taunton Locomotive\r\nWorks, to manufacture engines on the speculation that a buyer would be\r\nfound; if no immediate buyers appeared the engine was leased to a local\r\nroad until a sale was made.[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--AN EARLY BROADSIDE of the Cumberland Valley\r\nRailroad.]\r\n\r\nRegarding the _Jenny Lind_ and _Pioneer_, Smith reported[7] to the Board\r\nof Managers at their meeting of March 17, 1852:\r\n\r\n    The small tank engines which were purchased last year ... and\r\n    which I spoke in a former report as undergoing at that time some\r\n    necessary improvements have since that time been fairly tested\r\n    as to their capacity to run our passenger trains and proved to\r\n    be equal to the duty.\r\n\r\n    The improvements proposed to be made have been completed only on\r\n    one engine [_Jenny Lind_] which is now running regularly with\r\n    passenger trains--the cost of repairs and improvements on this\r\n    engine (this being the one accidentally broken on the trial)\r\n    amounted to $476.51. The other engine is now in the shop, not\r\n    yet ready for service but will be at an early day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--THE \"UTILITY\" AS REBUILT TO AN 8-WHEEL ENGINE,\r\nabout 1863 or 1864.

S. Hull, master mechanic of the Cumberland Valley\r\nRailroad in 1876. It depicts the engine as it appeared in 1871.\r\n(_Courtesy of Paul Westhaeffer._)]\r\n\r\nThe _Pioneer_ and _Jenny Lind_ achieved such success in action that the\r\npresident of the road, Frederick Watts, commented on their performance\r\nin the annual report of the Cumberland Valley Railroad for 1851. Watts\r\nstated that since their passenger trains were rarely more than a baggage\r\ncar and two coaches, the light locomotives \"... have been found to be\r\nadmirably adapted to our business.\" The Cumberland Valley Railroad,\r\ntherefore, added two more locomotives of similar design in the next few\r\nyears. These engines were the _Boston_ and the _Enterprise_, also built\r\nby Wilmarth in 1854-1855.\r\n\r\nWatts reported the _Pioneer_ and _Jenny Lind_ cost $7,642. A standard\r\n8-wheel engine cost about $6,500 to $8,000 each during this period. In\r\nrecent years, the Pennsylvania Railroad has stated the _Pioneer_ cost\r\n$6,200 in gold, but is unable to give the source for this information.\r\nThe author can discount this statement for it does not seem reasonable\r\nthat a light, cheap engine of the pattern of the _Pioneer_ could cost as\r\nmuch as a machine nearly twice its size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--ANNUAL PASS of the Cumberland Valley Railroad\r\nissued in 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--TIMETABLE OF THE Cumberland Valley Railroad\r\nfor 1878.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService History of the _Pioneer_\r\n\r\nAfter being put in service, the _Pioneer_ continued to perform well and\r\nwas credited as able to move a 4-car passenger train along smartly at 40\r\nmph.[8] This tranquility was shattered in October 1862 by a raiding\r\nparty led by Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart which burned the\r\nChambersburg shops of the Cumberland Valley Railroad. The _Pioneer_,\r\n_Jenny Lind_, and _Utility_ were partially destroyed. The Cumberland\r\nValley Railroad in its report for 1862 stated:\r\n\r\n    The Wood-shop, Machine-shop, Black-smith-shop, Engine-house,\r\n    Wood-sheds, and Passenger Depot were totally consumed, and with\r\n    the Engine-house three second-class Engines were much injured by\r\n    the fire, but not so destroyed but that they may be restored to\r\n    usefulness.\r\n\r\nHowever, no record can be found of the extent or exact nature of the\r\ndamage. The shops and a number of cars were burned so it is reasonable\r\nto assume that the cab and other wooden parts of the locomotive were\r\ndamaged. One unverified report in the files of the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nstates that part of the roof and brick wall fell on the _Pioneer_ during\r\nthe fire causing considerable damage. In June 1864 the Chambersburg\r\nshops were again burned by the Confederates, but on this occasion the\r\nrailroad managed to remove all its locomotives before the raid. During\r\nthe Civil War, the Cumberland Valley Railroad was obliged to operate\r\nlonger passenger trains to satisfy the enlarged traffic. The _Pioneer_\r\nand its sister single-axle engines were found too light for these trains\r\nand were used only on work and special trains. Reference to table 1 will\r\nshow that the mileage of the _Pioneer_ fell off sharply for the years\r\n1860-1865.\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--YEARLY MILEAGE OF THE PIONEER\r\n\r\n(From Annual Reports of the Cumberland Valley Railroad)\r\n\r\n    _Year_:             _Miles_\r\n\r\n    1852                  3,182[a]\r\n    1853                 20,722[b]\r\n    1854                 18,087\r\n    1855                 14,151\r\n    1856                 20,998\r\n    1857                 22,779\r\n    1858                 29,094\r\n    1859                 29,571\r\n    1860                  4,824\r\n    1861                  4,346\r\n    1862                   ([c])\r\n    1863                  5,339\r\n    1864                    224\r\n    1865                  2,215\r\n    1866                 20,546\r\n    1867                  5,709\r\n    1868                 13,626\r\n    1869                  1,372\r\n    1870                    ...\r\n    1871                  2,102\r\n    1872                  4,002\r\n    1873                  3,721\r\n    1874                  3,466\r\n    1875                    636\r\n    1876                    870\r\n    1877                    406\r\n    1878                  4,433\r\n    1879                    ...\r\n    1880                  8,306\r\n    1881                   ([d])\r\n                       ---------\r\n    Total               244,727[e]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO TABLE 1:\r\n\r\n     [a] Mileage 1852 for January to September (no record of mileage\r\n     recorded in Annual Reports previous to 1852).\r\n\r\n     [b] 15,000 to 20,000 miles per year was considered very high\r\n     mileage for a locomotive of the 1850's.\r\n\r\n     [c] No mileage reported for any engines due to fire.\r\n\r\n     [d] Not listed on roster.\r\n\r\n     [e] The Pennsylvania Railroad claims a total mileage of 255,675.\r\n     This may be accounted for by records of mileages for 1862, 1870,\r\n     and 1879.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the _Pioneer_ was remodeled by A. S. Hull, master mechanic of\r\nthe railroad. The exact nature of the alterations cannot be determined,\r\nas no drawings or photographs of the engine previous to this time are\r\nknown to exist. In fact, the drawing (fig. 8) prepared by Hull in 1876\r\nto show the engine as remodeled in 1871 is the oldest known illustration\r\nof the _Pioneer_. Paul Westhaeffer, a lifelong student of Cumberland\r\nValley R. R. history, states that according to an interview with one of\r\nHull's descendants the only alteration made to the _Pioneer_ during the\r\n1871 \"remodeling\" was the addition of a handbrake. The road's annual\r\nreport of 1853 describes the _Pioneer_ as a six-wheel tank engine. The\r\nreport of 1854 mentions that the _Pioneer_ used link motion. These\r\nstatements are enough to give substance to the idea that the basic\r\narrangement has survived unaltered and that it has not been extensively\r\nrebuilt, as was the _Jenny Lind_ in 1878.\r\n\r\nBy the 1870's, the _Pioneer_ was too light for the heavier cars then in\r\nuse and by 1880 it had reached the end of its usefulness for regular\r\nservice. After nearly thirty years on the road it had run 255,675 miles.\r\nTwo new passenger locomotives were purchased in 1880 to handle the\r\nheavier trains. In 1881 the _Pioneer_ was dropped from the roster, but\r\nwas used until about 1890 for work trains. After this time it was stored\r\nin a shed at Falling Spring, Pennsylvania, near the Chambersburg yards\r\nof the C.V.R.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Description of the _Pioneer_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--\"PIONEER,\" ABOUT 1901, scene unknown. (_Photo\r\ncourtesy of Thomas Norrell._)]\r\n\r\nAfter the early 1840's the single-axle locomotive, having one pair of\r\ndriving wheels, was largely superseded by the 8-wheel engine. The\r\ndesire to operate longer trains and the need for engines of greater\r\ntraction to overcome the steep grades of American roads called for\r\ncoupled driving wheels and machines of greater weight than the 4--2--0.\r\nAfter the introduction of the 4--4--0, the single-axle engine received\r\nlittle attention in this country except for light service or such\r\nspecial tasks as inspection or dummy engines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--THE \"PIONEER\" IN CARLISLE, PA., 1901. (_Photo\r\ncourtesy of Thomas Norrell._)]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a renewed interest in \"singles\" in the early 1850's\r\nbecause of W. B. Adams' experiments with light passenger locomotives in\r\nEngland. In 1850 Adams built a light single-axle tank locomotive for the\r\nEastern Counties Railway which proved very economical for light\r\npassenger traffic. It was such a success that considerable interest in\r\nlight locomotives was generated in this country as well as in England.\r\nNearly 100 single-axle locomotives were built in the United States\r\nbetween about 1845-1870. These engines were built by nearly every\r\nwell-known maker, from Hinkley in Boston to the Vulcan Foundry in San\r\nFrancisco. Danforth Cooke & Co. of Paterson built a standard pattern\r\n4--2--4 used by many roads. One of these, the _C. P. Huntington_,\r\nsurvives to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraphs describe the mechanical details of the\r\n_Pioneer_ as it appears on exhibition in the Smithsonian Institution's\r\nnew Museum of History and Technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILER\r\n\r\nThe boiler is the most important and costly part of a steam locomotive,\r\nrepresenting one-fourth to one-third of the total cost. A poorly built\r\nor designed boiler will produce a poor locomotive no matter how well\r\nmade the remainder of mechanism. The boiler of the _Pioneer_ is of the\r\nwagon-top, crownbar, fire-tube style and is made of a 5/16-inch thick,\r\nwrought-iron plate. The barrel is very small, in keeping with the size\r\nof the engine, being only 27 inches in diameter. While some readers may\r\nbelieve this to be an extremely early example of a wagon-top boiler, we\r\nshould remember that most New England builders produced few locomotives\r\nwith the Bury (dome) boiler and that the chief advocates of this later\r\nstyle were the Philadelphia builders. By the early 1850's the Bury\r\nboiler passed out of favor entirely and the wagon top became the\r\nstandard type of boiler with all builders in this country.\r\n\r\nSixty-three iron tubes, 1-7/8 inches by 85 inches long are used. The\r\noriginal tubes may have been copper or brass since these were easier to\r\nkeep tight than the less malleable iron tubes. The present tube sheet is\r\nof iron but was originally copper. Its thickness cannot be conveniently\r\nmeasured, but it is greater than that of the boiler shell, probably\r\nabout 1/2 to 5/8 inch. While copper tubes and tube sheets were not much\r\nused in this country after about 1870, copper was employed as recently\r\nas 1950 by Robert Stephenson & Hawthorns, Ltd., on some small industrial\r\nlocomotives.\r\n\r\nThe boiler shell is lagged with wooden tongue-and-groove strips about\r\n2-1/2 inches wide (felt also was used for insulation during this\r\nperiod). The wooden lagging is covered with Russia sheet iron which is\r\nheld in place and the joints covered by polished brass bands. Russia\r\nsheet iron is a planish iron having a lustrous, metallic gray finish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--THE \"FURY,\" BUILT FOR THE Boston and\r\nWorcester Railroad in 1849 by Wilmarth. It was known as a \"Shanghai\"\r\nbecause of its great height.

Note the similarity of this\r\nengine and the _Fury_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--THE \"PIONEER\" AS FIRST EXHIBITED in the Arts\r\nand Industries building of the Smithsonian Institution prior to\r\nrestoration of the sandbox. (Smithsonian photo 48069D.)]\r\n\r\nThe steam dome (fig. 18) is located directly over the firebox, inside\r\nthe cab. It is lagged and jacketed in an identical manner to the boiler.\r\nThe shell of the dome is of 5/16-inch wrought iron, the top cap is a\r\ncast-iron plate which also serves as a manhole cover offering access to\r\nthe boiler's interior for inspection and repair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--\"PIONEER\" locomotive.

H.\r\nWhite.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--\"PIONEER\" LOCOMOTIVE, (1) Safety valve, (2)\r\nspring balance, (3) steam jet, (4) dry pipe, (5) throttle lever, (6)\r\nthrottle, (7) crown bar, (8) front tube sheet, (9) check valve, (10) top\r\nrail, (11) rear-boiler bracket, (12) pedestal, (13) rocker bearing, (14)\r\ndamper, (15) grate, (16) bottom rail, (17) pump heater valve, (18)\r\ncylinder lubricator, (19) reversing lever, (20) brake shoe, (21) mud\r\nring, (22) blowoff cock, (23) ashpan. (Drawing by J. H. White.)]\r\n\r\nA round plate, 20 inches in diameter, riveted on the forward end of the\r\nboiler, just behind the bell stand, was found when the old jacket was\r\nremoved in May 1963. The size and shape of the hole, which the plate\r\ncovers, indicate that a steam dome or manhole was located at this point.\r\nIt is possible that this was the original location of the steam dome\r\nsince many builders in the early 1850's preferred to mount the dome\r\nforward of the firebox. This was done in the belief that there was less\r\ndanger of priming because the water was less agitated forward of the\r\nfirebox.\r\n\r\nThe firebox is as narrow as the boiler shell and fits easily between the\r\nframe. It is a deep and narrow box, measuring 27 inches by 28 inches by\r\nabout 40 inches deep, and is well suited to burning wood. A deep firebox\r\nwas necessary because a wide, shallow box suitable for coal burning,\r\nallowed the fuel to burn so quickly it was difficult to fire the engine\r\neffectively. With the deep, narrow firebox, wood was filled up to the\r\nlevel of the fire door. In this way, the fire did not burn so furiously\r\nand did not keep ahead of the fireman; at the same time, since it burned\r\nso freely, a good fire was always on hand. The _Pioneer_ burned oak and\r\nhickory.[14] For the firebox 5/16-inch thick sheet was used, for heavier\r\nsheet would have blistered and flaked off because of the intense heat of\r\nthe fire and the fibrous quality of wrought-iron sheet of the period.\r\nSheet iron was fabricated from many small strips of iron rolled together\r\nwhile hot. These strips were ideally welded into a homogeneous sheet,\r\nbut in practice it was found the thicker the sheet the less sure the\r\nweld.\r\n\r\nThe fire grates are cast iron and set just a few inches above the bottom\r\nof the water space so that the water below the grates remains less\r\nturbulent and mud or other impurities in the water settle here. Four\r\nbronze mud plugs and a blowoff cock are fitted to the base of the\r\nfirebox so that the sediment thus collected can be removed (figs. 17,\r\n18).\r\n\r\nThe front of the boiler is attached to the frame by the smokebox, which\r\nis a cylinder, bolted on a light, cast-iron saddle (not part of the\r\ncylinder castings nor attached to them, but bolted directly to the top\r\nrail of the frame; it may be a hastily made repair put on at the shops\r\nof the C.V.R.R.). The rear of the boiler is attached to the frame by two\r\nlarge cast-iron brackets, one on each side of the firebox (fig. 18).\r\nThese are bolted to the top rail of the frame but the holes in the\r\nbrackets are undoubtedly slotted, so that they may slide since the\r\nboiler will expand about 1/4 inch when heated. In addition to the crown\r\nbars, which strengthen the crown sheet, the boiler is further\r\nstrengthened by stay bolts and braces located in the wagon top over the\r\nfirebox, where the boiler had been weakened by the large hole necessary\r\nfor the steam dome. This boiler is a remarkably light, strong, and\r\ncompact structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILER FITTINGS\r\n\r\nFew boiler fittings are found on the _Pioneer_ and it appears that\r\nlittle was done to update the engine with more modern devices during its\r\nmany years of service. With the exception of the steam gauge, it has no\r\nmore boiler fitting than when it left the builder's shop in 1851.\r\n\r\nThe throttle valve is a simple slide valve and must have been primitive\r\nfor the time, for the balance-poppet throttle valve was in use in this\r\ncountry previous to 1851. It is located directly below the steam dome\r\neven though it was common practice to place the throttle valve at the\r\nfront of the boiler in the smokebox. Considering the cramped condition\r\ninside the smokebox, there would seem to be little space for the\r\naddition of the throttle valve; hence its present location. The dry pipe\r\nprojects up into the steam dome to gather the hottest, driest steam for\r\nthe cylinders. The inverted, funnel-like cap on the top of the dry pipe\r\nis to prevent priming, as drops of water may travel up the sides of the\r\npipe and then to the cylinders, with the possibility of great damage.\r\nAfter the steam enters the throttle valve it passes through the front\r\nend of the valve, through the top of the boiler via the dry pipe (fig.\r\n18), through the front tube sheet, and then to the cylinders via the\r\npetticoat pipes. The throttle lever is a simple arrangement readily\r\nunderstood from the drawings. It has no latch and the throttle lever is\r\nheld in any desired setting by the wingnut and quadrant shown in figure\r\n18. The water level in the boiler is indicated by the three brass cocks\r\nlocated on the backhead. No gauge glass is used; they were not employed\r\nin this country until the 1870's, although they were commonly used in\r\nEngland at the time the _Pioneer_ was built.\r\n\r\nWhile two safety valves were commonly required, only one was used on the\r\n_Pioneer_. The safety valve is located on top of the steam dome.\r\nPressure is exerted on the lever by a spring balance, fixed at the\r\nforward end by a knife-blade bearing. The pressure can be adjusted by\r\nthe thumbscrew on the balance. The graduated scale on the balance gave a\r\ngeneral but uncertain indication of the boiler pressure. The valve\r\nitself is a poppet held against the face of the valve seat by a second\r\nknife blade attached to the lever. The ornamental column forming the\r\nstand of the safety valve is cast iron and does much to decorate the\r\ninterior of the cab. The pipe carrying the escaping steam projects\r\nthrough the cab roof. It is made of copper with a decorative brass band.\r\nThis entire mechanism was replaced by a modern safety valve for use at\r\nthe Chicago Railroad Fair (1949). Fortunately, the old valve was\r\npreserved and has since been replaced on the engine.\r\n\r\nThe steam gauge is a later addition, but could have been put on as early\r\nas the 1860's, since the most recent patent date that it bears is 1859.\r\nIt is an Ashcroft gauge having a handsome 4--4--0 locomotive engraved on\r\nits silver face.\r\n\r\nThe steam jet (item 3, fig. 18) is one of the simplest yet most notable\r\nboiler fitting of the _Pioneer_, being nothing more than a valve tapped\r\ninto the base of the steam dome with a line running under the boiler\r\njacket to the smokestack. When the valve is opened a jet of steam goes\r\nup the stack, creating a draft useful for starting the fire or\r\nenlivening it as necessary. This device was the invention of Alba F.\r\nSmith in 1852, according to the eminent 19th-century technical writer\r\nand engineer Zerah Colburn.[15]\r\n\r\nThe two feedwater pumps (fig. 20) are located beneath the cab deck (1,\r\nfig. 17). They are cast-iron construction and are driven by an eccentric\r\non the driving-wheel axle (fig. 27). The airchamber or dome (1, fig. 27)\r\nimparts a more steady flow of the water to the boiler by equalizing the\r\nsurges of water from the reciprocating pump plunger. A steam line (3,\r\nfig. 18), which heats the pump and prevents freezing in cold weather, is\r\nregulated by a valve in the cab (figs. 18, 27). Note that the line on\r\nthe right side of the cab has been disconnected and plugged.\r\n\r\nThe eccentric drive for the pumps is unusual, and the author knows of no\r\nother American locomotive so equipped. Eastwick and Harrison, it is\r\ntrue, favored an eccentric drive for feed pumps, but they mounted the\r\neccentric on the crankpin of the rear driving wheel and thus produced in\r\neffect a half-stroke pump. This was not an unusual arrangement, though a\r\nsmall crank was usually employed in place of the eccentric. The\r\nfull-stroke crosshead pump with which the _Jenny Lind_ (fig. 22) is\r\nequipped, was of course the most common style of feed pump used in this\r\ncountry in the 19th century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--BACKHEAD of the _Pioneer_. (Smithsonian photo\r\n48069F.)]\r\n\r\nOf all the mechanisms on a 19th-century locomotive, the feed pump was\r\nthe most troublesome. If an engineer could think of nothing else to\r\ncomplain about, he could usually call attention to a defective pump and\r\nnot be found a liar. Because of this, injectors were adopted after their\r\nintroduction in 1860. It is surprising that the _Pioneer_, which was in\r\nregular service as late as 1880 and has been under steam many times\r\nsince for numerous exhibitions, was never fitted with one of these\r\ndevices. Because its stroke is short and the plunger is in less rapid\r\nmotion, the present eccentric arrangement is more complex but less prone\r\nto disorder than the simpler but faster crosshead pump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--FEEDWATER PUMP of the _Pioneer_. (Smithsonian\r\nphoto 63344.)]\r\n\r\nThe check valves are placed slightly below the centerline of the boiler\r\n(fig. 18). These valves are an unfinished bronze casting and appear to\r\nbe of a recent pattern, probably dating from the 1901 renovation. At the\r\ntime the engine was built, it was usual to house these valves in an\r\nornamental spun-brass casing. The smokestack is of the bonnet type\r\ncommonly used on wood-burning locomotives in this country between about\r\n1845 and 1870. The exhaust steam from the cylinders is directed up the\r\nstraight stack (shown in phantom in fig. 27) by the blast pipe. This\r\ncreates a partial vacuum in the smokebox that draws the fire, gases,\r\nash, and smoke through the boiler tubes from the firebox. The force of\r\nthe exhausting steam blows them out the stack. At the top of the\r\nstraight stack is a deflecting cone which slows the velocity of the\r\nexhaust and changes its direction causing it to go down into the\r\nfunnel-shaped outer casing of the stack. Here, the heavy embers and\r\ncinders are collected and prevented from directly discharging into the\r\ncountryside as dangerous firebrands. Wire netting is stretched overtop\r\nof the deflecting cone to catch the lighter, more volatile embers which\r\nmay defy the action of the cone. The term \"bonnet stack\" results from\r\nthe fact that this netting is similar in shape to a lady's bonnet. The\r\ncinders thus accumulated in the stack's hopper could be emptied by\r\nopening a plug at the base of the stack.\r\n\r\nWhile the deflecting cone was regarded highly as a spark arrester and\r\nused practically to the exclusion of any other arrangement, it had the\r\nbasic defect of keeping the smoke low and close to the train. This was a\r\ngreat nuisance to passengers, as the low trailing smoke blew into the\r\ncars. If the exhaust had been allowed to blast straight out the stack\r\nhigh into the air, most of the sparks would have burned out before\r\ntouching the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--\"PIONEER\" ON EXHIBIT in old Arts and\r\nIndustries building of the Smithsonian Institution.

While the simple bar frame enjoyed the greatest\r\npopularity in the last century, riveted frames were widely used in this\r\ncountry, particularly by the New England builders between about 1840 and\r\n1860. The riveted frame was fabricated from two plates of iron, about\r\n5/8-inch thick, cut to the shape of the top rail and the pedestal. A bar\r\nabout 2 inches square was riveted between the two plates. A careful\r\nstudy of photographs of Hinkley and other New England-built engines of\r\nthe period will reveal this style of construction. The frame of the\r\n_Pioneer_ differs from the usual riveted frame in that the top rail is\r\n1-3/4 inches thick by 4-1/8 inches deep and runs the length of the\r\nlocomotive. The pedestals are made of two 3/8-inch plates flush-riveted\r\nto each side of the top rail. The cast-iron shoes which serve as guides\r\nfor the journal boxes also act as spacers between the pedestal plates.\r\n\r\nThe bottom rail of the frame is a 1-1/8-inch diameter rod which is\r\nforged square at the pedestals and forms the pedestal cap. The frame is\r\nfurther stiffened by two diagonal rods running from the top of each\r\ntruck-wheel pedestal to the base of the driving-wheel pedestal, forming\r\na truss. Six rods, riveted to the boiler shell and bolted to the frame's\r\ntop rail, strengthen the frame laterally. Four of these rods can be seen\r\neasily as they run from the frame to the middle of the boiler; the other\r\ntwo are riveted to the underside of the boiler. The attachment of these\r\nrods to the boiler was an undesirable practice, for the boiler shell\r\nwas thus subjected to the additional strain of the locomotive's\r\nvibrations as it passed over the road. In later years, as locomotives\r\ngrew in size, this practice was avoided and frames were made\r\nsufficiently strong to hold the engine's machinery in line without using\r\nthe boiler shell.\r\n\r\nThe front and rear frame beams are of flat iron plate bolted to the\r\nframe. The rear beam had been pushed in during an accident, and instead\r\nof its being replaced, another plate was riveted on and bent out in the\r\nopposite direction to form a pocket for the rear coupling pin. Note that\r\nthere is no drawbar and that the coupler is merely bolted to the beams.\r\nSince the engine only pulled light trains, the arrangement was\r\nsufficiently strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNNING GEAR\r\n\r\nThe running gear is simply sprung with individual leaf springs for each\r\naxle; it is not connected by equalizing levers. To find an American\r\nlocomotive not equipped with equalizers is surprising since they were\r\nalmost a necessity to produce a reasonably smooth ride on the rough\r\ntracks of American railroads. Equalizers steadied the motion of the\r\nengine by distributing the shock received by any one wheel or axle to\r\nall the other wheels and axles so connected, thus minimizing the effects\r\nof an uneven roadbed. The author believes that the _Pioneer_ is a\r\nhard-riding engine.\r\n\r\nThe springs of the main drives are mounted in the usual fashion. The\r\nrear boiler bracket (fig. 18) is slotted so that the spring hanger may\r\npass through for its connection with the frame. The spring of the\r\nleading wheels is set at right angles to the frame (fig. 27) and bears\r\non a beam, fabricated of iron plate, which in turn bears on the journal\r\nboxes. The springs of the trailing wheels are set parallel with the\r\nframe and are mounted between the pedestal plates (fig. 18).\r\n\r\nThe center of the driving wheel is cast iron and has spokes of the old\r\nrib pattern, which is a T in cross section, and was used previous to the\r\nadoption of the hollow spoke wheel. In the mid-1830's Baldwin and others\r\nused this rib-pattern style of wheel, except that the rib faced inside.\r\nThe present driving-wheel centers are unquestionably original. The\r\nsister engine _Jenny Lind_ (fig. 22) was equipped with identical driving\r\nwheels. The present tires are very thin and beyond their last turning.\r\nThey are wrought iron and shrunk to fit the wheel centers. Flush rivets\r\nare used for further security. The left wheel, shown in figure 17, is\r\ncracked at the hub and is fitted with an iron ring to prevent its\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\nThe truck wheels, of the hollow spoke pattern, are cast iron with\r\nchilled treads. They were made by Asa Whitney, one of the leading\r\ncar-wheel manufacturers in this country, whose extensive plant was\r\nlocated in Philadelphia. Made under Whitney's patent of 1866, these\r\nwheels may well have been added to the _Pioneer_ during the 1871\r\nrebuilding. Railroad wheels were not cast from ordinary cast iron, which\r\nwas too weak and brittle to stand the severe service for which they were\r\nintended, but from a high-quality cast iron similar to that used for\r\ncannons. Its tensile strength, which ranged from 31,000 to 36,000 psi,\r\nwas remarkably high and very nearly approached that of the best\r\nwrought-iron plate.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders are cast iron with an 8-1/2-inch bore about half the size\r\nof the cylinders of a standard 8-wheel engine. The cylinders are bolted\r\nto the frame but not to the saddle, and are set at a 9 deg. angle to clear\r\nthe leading wheels and at the same time to line up with the center of\r\nthe driving-wheel axle. The wood lagging is covered with a decorative\r\nbrass jacket. Ornamental brass jacketing was extensively used on\r\nmid-19th-century American locomotives to cover not only the cylinders\r\nbut steam and sand boxes, check valves, and valve boxes. The greater\r\nexpense for brass (Russia iron or painted sheet iron were a cheaper\r\nsubstitute) was justified by the argument that brass lasted the life of\r\nthe engine, and could be reclaimed for scrap at a price approaching the\r\noriginal cost; and also that when brightly polished it reflected the\r\nheat, preventing loss by radiation, and its bright surface could be seen\r\na great distance, thus helping to prevent accidents at grade crossings.\r\nThe reader should be careful not to misconstrue the above arguments\r\nsimply as rationalization on the part of master mechanics more intent on\r\nhighly decorative machines than on the practical considerations\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe valve box, a separate casting, is fastened to the cylinder casting\r\nby six bolts. The side cover plates when removed show only a small\r\nopening suitable for inspection and adjustment of the valve. The valve\r\nbox must be removed to permit repair or removal of the valve. A better\r\nunderstanding of this mechanism and the layout of the parts can be\r\ngained from a study of figures 23-26, 28 (8, 8A, and 8B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.--\"PIONEER\" LOCOMOTIVE.

(Drawing by J. H. White.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28.--REAR ELEVATION of _Pioneer_ and detail of\r\nvalve shifter; valve face and valve. (Drawing by J. H. White.)]\r\n\r\nBoth crossheads were originally of cast iron but one of these has been\r\nreplaced and is of steel. They run into steel guides, bolted at the\r\nforward end to the rear cylinder head and supported in the rear by a\r\nyoke. The yoke is one of the more finished and better made pieces on the\r\nentire engine (fig. 27). The main rod is of the old pattern, round in\r\ncross section, and only 1-1/2 inches in diameter at the largest point.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALVE GEAR\r\n\r\nThe valve gear is of the Stephenson shifting-link pattern (see fig. 27),\r\na simple and dependable motion used extensively in this country between\r\nabout 1850 and 1900. The author believes that this is the original valve\r\ngear of the _Pioneer_, since the first mention (1854) in the _Annual\r\nReport_ of the Cumberland Valley Railroad of the style of valve gear\r\nused by each engine, states that the _Pioneer_ was equipped with a\r\nshifting-link motion. Assuming this to be the original valve gear of the\r\n_Pioneer_, it must be regarded as an early application, because the\r\nStephenson motion was just being introduced into American locomotive\r\npractice in the early 1850's. Four eccentrics drive the motion; two are\r\nfor forward motion and two for reverse. The link is split and made of\r\ntwo curved pieces. The rocker is fabricated of several forged pieces\r\nkeyed and bolted together. On better made engines the rocker would be a\r\none-piece forging. The lower arm of each rocker is curiously shaped,\r\nmade with a slot so that the link block may be adjusted. Generally, the\r\nonly adjustment possible was effected by varying the length of the valve\r\nstem by the adjusting nuts provided. A simple weight and lever attached\r\nto the reversing shaft serve as a counterbalance for the links and thus\r\nassist the engineer in shifting the valve motion. There are eight\r\npositions on the quadrant of the reversing lever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 29.--\"PIONEER\" on exhibit in old Arts and\r\nIndustries building, showing the tank and backhead. (Smithsonian photo\r\n48069E.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS NOTES\r\n\r\nThe cab is solid walnut with a natural finish. It is very possible that\r\nthe second cab was added to the locomotive after the 1862 fire. A brass\r\ngong used by the conductor to signal the engineer is fastened to the\r\nunderside of the cab roof. This style of gong was in use in the 1850's\r\nand may well be original equipment.\r\n\r\nThe water tank is in two sections, one part extending below the deck,\r\nbetween the frame. The tank holds 600 gallons of water. The tender holds\r\none cord of wood.\r\n\r\nThe small pedestal-mounted sandbox was used on several Cumberland Valley\r\nengines including the _Pioneer_. This box was removed from the engine\r\nsometime between 1901 and 1904. It was on the engine at the time of the\r\nCarlisle sesquicentennial but disappeared by the time of the St. Louis\r\nexposition. Two small sandboxes, mounted on the driving-wheel splash\r\nguards, replaced the original box. The large headlamp (fig. 3)\r\napparently disappeared at the same time and was replaced by a crudely\r\nmade lamp formerly mounted on the cab roof as a backup light. Headlamps\r\nof commercial manufacture were carefully finished and made with\r\nparabolic reflectors, elaborate burners, and handsomely fitted cases.\r\nSuch a lamp could throw a beam of light for 1000 feet. The present lamp\r\nhas a flat cone-shaped piece of tin for a reflector.\r\n\r\nThe brushes attached to the pilot were used in the winter to brush snow\r\nand loose ice off the rail and thus improve traction. In good weather\r\nthe brushes were set up to clear the tracks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--RECONSTRUCTED SANDBOX replaced on the\r\nlocomotive, August 1962. (Drawing by J. H. White.)]\r\n\r\nAfter the _Pioneer_ had come to the National Museum, it was decided that\r\nsome refinishing was required to return it as nearly as possible to the\r\nstate of the original engine. Replacing the sandbox was an obvious\r\nchange.[20] The brass cylinder jackets were also replaced. The cab was\r\nstripped and carefully refinished as natural wood. The old safety valve\r\nwas replaced, as already mentioned. Rejacketing the boiler with\r\nsimulated Russia iron produced a most pleasing effect, adding not only\r\nto the authenticity of the display but making the engine appear lighter\r\nand relieving the somber blackness which was not characteristic of a\r\nlocomotive of the 1850's. Several minor replacements are yet to be done;\r\nchiefly among these are the cylinder-cock linkage and a proper headlamp.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, has the engine survived as a true and accurate\r\nrepresentation of the original machine built in 1851? In answer, it can\r\nbe said that although the _Pioneer_ was damaged en route to the\r\nCumberland Valley Railroad, modified on receipt, burned in 1862, and\r\noperated for altogether nearly 40 years, surprisingly few new appliances\r\nhave been added, nor has the general arrangement been changed.\r\nUndoubtedly, the main reason the engine is so little changed is that its\r\nsmall size and odd framing did not invite any large investment for\r\nextensive alteration for other uses. But there can be no positive answer\r\nas to its present variance from the original appearance as represented\r\nin the oldest known illustration of it--the Hull drawing of 1871 (fig.\r\n8). There are few, if any, surviving 19th-century locomotives that have\r\nnot suffered numerous rebuildings and are not greatly altered from the\r\noriginal. The _John Bull_, also in the U.S. National Museum collection,\r\nis a good example of a machine many times rebuilt in its 30 years of\r\nservice.[21] Unless other information is uncovered to the contrary, it\r\ncan be stated that the _Pioneer_ is a true representation of a light\r\npassenger locomotive of 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alba F. Smith_\r\n\r\nAlba F. Smith, the man responsible for the purchase of the _Pioneer_,\r\nwas born in Lebanon, Connecticut, June 28, 1817.[9] Smith showed promise\r\nas a mechanic at an early age and by the time he was 22 had established\r\nleadpipe works in Norwich. His attention was drawn particularly to\r\nlocomotives since the tracks of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad\r\npassed his shop. His attempts to develop a spark arrester for\r\nlocomotives brought Smith to the favorable attention of Captain Daniel\r\nTyler (1799-1882), president of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad. When\r\nTyler was hired by the Cumberland Valley Railroad in 1850 to supervise\r\nthe line's rebuilding, he persuaded the managers of that road to hire\r\nSmith as superintendent of machinery.[10] Smith was appointed as\r\nsuperintendent of the machine shop of the Cumberland Valley Railroad on\r\nJuly 22, 1850.[11] On January 1, 1851, he became superintendent of the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nIn March of 1856 Smith resigned his position with the Cumberland Valley\r\nRailroad and became superintendent of the Hudson River Railroad, where\r\nhe remained for only a year. During that time he designed the\r\ncoal-burning locomotive _Irvington_, rebuilt the Waterman condensing\r\ndummy locomotive for use in hauling trains through city streets, and\r\ndeveloped a superheater.[12]\r\n\r\nAfter retiring from the Hudson River Railroad he returned to Norwich and\r\nbecame active in enterprises in that area, including the presidency of\r\nthe Norwich and Worcester Railroad. While the last years of Smith's life\r\nwere devoted to administrative work, he found time for mechanical\r\ninvention as well. In 1862 he patented a safety truck for locomotives,\r\nand became president of a concern which controlled the most important\r\npatents for such devices.[13] Alba F. Smith died on July 21, 1879, in\r\nNorwich, Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nUNION WORKS,\r\n\r\nSOUTH BOSTON,\r\n\r\nSETH WILMARTH, Proprietor,\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURER OF\r\n\r\nLOCOMOTIVES,\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY STEAM ENGINES AND STEAM BOILERS,\r\n\r\nOF THE VARIOUS SIZES REQUIRED,\r\n\r\n_Parts connected with Railroads, including Frogs, Switches, Chairs and\r\nHand Cars._\r\n\r\nMACHINISTS' TOOLS, of all descriptions, including _TURNING LATHES_, of\r\nsizes varying from 6 feet to 50 feet in length, and weighing from 500\r\npounds to 40 tons each; the latter capable of turning a wheel or pulley,\r\n_thirty feet in diameter_.\r\n\r\nPLANING MACHINES,\r\n\r\nVarying from 2 feet to 60 feet in length, and weighing from 200 lbs. to\r\n70 tons each, and will plane up to 55 feet long and 7 feet square.\r\n\r\nBoring Mills, Vertical and Horizontal Drills, Slotting Machines,\r\nPunching Presses, Gear and Screw Cutting Machines, &c. &c.

For the reader's general interest the following information\r\nis noted.[16]\r\n\r\nSeth Wilmarth was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, on September 8, 1810. He\r\nis thought to have learned the machinist trade in Pawtucket, Rhode\r\nIsland, before coming to Boston and working for the Boston Locomotive\r\nWorks, Hinkley and Drury proprietors. In about 1836 he opened a machine\r\nshop and, encouraged by an expanding business, in 1841 he built a new\r\nshop in South Boston which became known as the Union Works.[17] Wilmarth\r\nwas in the general machine business but his reputation was made in the\r\nmanufacture of machine tools, notably lathes. He is believed to have\r\nbuilt his first locomotive in 1842, but locomotive building never became\r\nhis main line of work. Wilmarth patterned his engines after those of\r\nHinkley and undoubtedly, in common with the other New England builders\r\nof this period, favored the steady-riding, inside-connection engines.\r\nThe \"Shanghais,\" so-called because of their great height, built for the\r\nBoston and Worcester Railroad by Wilmarth in 1849, were among the best\r\nknown inside-connection engines operated in this country (fig. 14).\r\nWhile the greater part of Wilmarth's engines was built for New England\r\nroads, many were constructed for lines outside that area, including the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Erie.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the surviving illustrations of Hinkley and Wilmarth\r\nengines of the 1850's reveals a remarkable similarity in their details\r\n(figs. 14 and 15). Notice particularly the straight boiler, riveted\r\nframe, closely set truck wheels, feedwater pump driven by a pin on the\r\ncrank of the driving wheel, and details of the dome cover. All of the\r\nfeatures are duplicated exactly by both builders. This is not surprising\r\nconsidering the proximity of the plants and the fact that Wilmarth had\r\nbeen previously employed by Hinkley.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Wilmarth was engaged by the New York and Erie Railroad to build\r\nfifty 6-foot gauge engines.[18] After work had been started on these\r\nengines, and a large store of material had been purchased for their\r\nconstruction, Wilmarth was informed that the railroad could not pay cash\r\nbut that he would have to take notes in payment.[19] There was at this\r\ntime a mild economic panic and notes could be sold only at a heavy\r\ndiscount. This crisis closed the Union Works. The next year, 1855, Seth\r\nWilmarth was appointed master mechanic of the Charlestown Navy Yard,\r\nBoston, where he worked for twenty years. He died in Malden,\r\nMassachusetts, on November 5, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n   [1]  _Minutes of the Board of Managers of the Cumberland Valley\r\n        Railroad._ This book may be found in the office of the\r\n        Secretary, Pennsylvania Railroad, Philadelphia, Pa., June 25,\r\n        1851.

The original\r\n    collection of a few hundred specimens of crude drugs which had\r\n    been exhibited at the centennial exhibition of 1876 at\r\n    Philadelphia, has now developed into the largest collection in\r\n    the Western Hemisphere of historical objects related to the\r\n    healing arts._\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR: _Sami Hamarneh is the curator of the Division of\r\n    Medical Sciences in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of\r\n    History and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the early 1870's, leading figures from both the health professions\r\nand the general public had begun to realize the necessity for having the\r\nmedical sciences represented in the Smithsonian Institution. The impetus\r\nbehind this new feeling resulted from the action of a distinguished\r\nAmerican physician, philanthropist, and author, Joseph Meredith Toner\r\n(1825-1896), and came almost a decade before the integration of a new\r\nsection concerned with research and the historical and educational\r\naspects of the healing arts in the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, Dr. Toner established the \"Toner Lectures\" to encourage efforts\r\ntowards discovering new truths \"for the advancement of medical science\r\n... for the benefit of mankind.\" To finance these lectures, he provided\r\na fund worth approximately $3,000 to be administered by a board of\r\ntrustees consisting of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the\r\nSurgeon General of the U.S. Navy, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army\r\n(only in some years), and the president of the Medical Society of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. The interest from this fund was to compensate\r\nphysicians and scholars who were to deliver \"at least two annual memoirs\r\nor essays\" based on original research on some branch of the medical\r\nsciences and containing information which had been verified \"by\r\nexperiments or observations.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution agreed to have these\r\nlectures published by the Institution in its Miscellaneous Collections.\r\nThe first lecture given by the Assistant Surgeon of the U.S. Army, \"On\r\nthe Structure of Cancerous Tumors and the Mode in which Adjacent parts\r\nare Invaded,\" deserves credit even by current standards of scientific\r\nresearch.[2] Only 10 lectures were given between 1873 and 1890 (see\r\nbibliography), despite the recommendation for at least two every\r\nyear.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--DR. JOSEPH M. TONER, a leading physician in\r\nWashington, D.C., and founder of the \"Toner Lectures\" for the promotion\r\nand advancement of medical education and research. In 1873, Dr. Toner\r\nbecame president of the American Medical Association and, in 1874, he\r\nbecame president of the American Public Health Association. He was a\r\nphysician to St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum and St. Ann's Infants'\r\nAsylum in Washington, D.C. In addition, he was instrumental in\r\nestablishing Providence Hospital in the District of Columbia. He also\r\nprovided a workable plan for the American Medical Association's library\r\nin Washington, D.C. (1868-1871). Among his several publications are:\r\n_Contributions to the Annals of Medical Progress and Medical Education\r\nin the United States before and during the War of Independence_\r\n(Washington: Government Printing Office, 1874) and _Medical Men of the\r\nRevolution_ (1876). In 1882, he donated his large library, consisting of\r\n44,000 books and pamphlets on topics related mainly to medicine and\r\nhistory, to the Library of Congress. (_Photo courtesy of National\r\nLibrary of Medicine._)]\r\n\r\nA more direct factor, which not only contributed to the establishment of\r\na section on the healing arts, but also had a greater effect upon the\r\nSmithsonian Institution than any other event since its founding, was the\r\n1876 centennial exhibition in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent international fair commemorated the hundredth\r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. The\r\nfinest exhibits of 30 foreign countries and various States of the Union\r\nparticipating in the fair were finally donated to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution as the official depository of historical and archeological\r\nobjects for this country. As a result, the Institution's collections\r\nincreased to an extent far beyond the capacity of the first Smithsonian\r\nbuilding. This led to the erection of the National Museum, known for the\r\nlast two decades and until date of publication as the Arts and\r\nIndustries building, which was completed on March 4, 1881, and was used\r\nthat evening for the inaugural reception of incoming President James A.\r\nGarfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection of Materia Medica (1881-1898)\r\n\r\nThroughout the 19th century, the study of _materia medica_ (dealing with\r\nthe nature and properties of drugs of various kinds and origins, their\r\ncollection and mode of administration for the treatment of diseases, and\r\nthe medicinal utilization of animal products) held an increasingly\r\nimportant place among the medical sciences. In the United States, as in\r\nother civilized countries, this topic was greatly emphasized in the\r\ncurriculum of almost every school teaching the health professions.\r\nToday, the subject matter contained in this branch of science is taught\r\nunder the heading of several specialized fields, such as pharmacology,\r\npharmacognosy, and drug analysis of various types. However, when the\r\ndecision was made in 1881 to promote greater knowledge and interest in\r\nthe healing arts by creating a section devoted to such pursuits in the\r\nU.S. National Museum, the title of Section of Materia Medica was\r\nadopted. Added to this, was the fact that the bulk of the first\r\ncollections received in the Section was a great variety of crude drugs,\r\nwhich constituted much of the material then taught in the academic\r\ncourses of _materia medica_.\r\n\r\nThe new Section was included in the Department of Arts and Industries,\r\nthen under the curatorship of Assistant Director G. Brown Goode. From\r\nits beginning and for two decades, however, the Section of Materia\r\nMedica was sponsored and supervised by the U.S. Navy in cooperation with\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution. For this reason, the Navy decided not to\r\nestablish a similar bureau for a health museum as did the Army in\r\nstarting the Medical Museum (of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology)\r\nin 1862 through the efforts of Dr. William Alexander Hammond. The\r\nSmithsonian did, however, provide a clerk to relieve the curator of much\r\nof the routine work. The Section's early vigorous activities were the\r\nresult of the ingenuity of the first honorary curator, Dr. James Milton\r\nFlint (1838-1919), an Assistant Surgeon of the U.S. Navy. From the\r\nestablishment of the Section, in 1881, to 1912, Dr. Flint was curator\r\nduring separate periods for a total of nearly 25 years. For three of his\r\ntenures (1881-1884; 1887-1891; 1895-1900), he was detailed to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution by the Surgeon General of the U.S. Navy. During\r\nthe interim periods, other naval doctors were detailed as curators.\r\nFinally, in 1900, Dr. Flint retired from the Navy with the rank of Rear\r\nAdmiral and volunteered to continue his services to the National Museum.\r\nThe proposal was gladly accepted and he continued as a curator until his\r\nretirement from the Smithsonian Institution in 1912.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--REAR ADMIRAL JAMES M. FLINT, U.S. Navy surgeon\r\nand first honorary curator of the Section of Materia Medica. (_Photo\r\ncourtesy of the Library of Congress._)]\r\n\r\nThe Section commenced with a wealth of material. After the close of the\r\n1876 centennial exhibition, its _materia medica_ collection had been\r\nstored with the other collections in a warehouse, awaiting an\r\nappropriation by Congress for transfer and installation. This collection\r\nwas gradually brought into the new National Museum after that building's\r\ncompletion in 1881. Many other _materia medica_ specimens were\r\ntransferred from the Department of Agriculture. In addition to these\r\nlarge collections of crude drugs, generous contributions came from\r\nseveral prominent pharmaceutical firms such as Parke, Davis & Company of\r\nDetroit, Michigan; Wallace Brothers of Statesville, North Carolina; and\r\nSchieffelin and Company of New York City. These manufacturing houses are\r\nmentioned here because they and their agents abroad were the first to\r\ntake interest and donate to the Section, complete assortments of\r\ncontemporary remedial agents then in common use throughout the United\r\nStates and Europe, besides many hundreds of \"rare and curious drugs.\"\r\nThus, in spite of difficulties encountered from bringing several\r\ncollections into the building at one time, the _materia medica_\r\nexhibition got off to a good start.\r\n\r\nIt was Dr. Flint, the first curator, who stated in 1883 that remedial\r\nagents used by a nation or a community are as indicative of the degree\r\nof their cultural development and standard of living as is the nature of\r\ntheir food, the character of their dwellings, and their social and\r\nreligious traditions. Therefore, he felt that collections of drugs and\r\nmedical, surgical and pharmaceutical instruments and appliances should\r\nnot be thought of or designed as instructive to the specialist only, but\r\nshould also possess a general interest for the public. Because of these\r\nobjectives, Dr. Flint added, this section was conceived as a\r\ndepartmental division for the collecting and exhibiting of objects\r\nrelated to medicine, surgery, pharmacology, hygiene, and all material\r\nrelated to the health field at large.[4]\r\n\r\nDuring his first term of curatorship (1881-1884), Dr. Flint devoted much\r\nof his time to sorting, examining, identifying, and classifying the\r\n_materia medica_ specimens.[5] In 1881, he issued a memorandum of\r\ninstructions to be followed by collectors of drugs and urged them to\r\ngive detailed and accurate information regarding acquired specimens so\r\nthat they might be \"more than mere museum curiosities.\" In addition, in\r\n1883, he prepared a brief manual of classification of the _materia\r\nmedica_ collection in the Museum as well as a useful, detailed catalog\r\nof informational labels of the individual objects on exhibition. The\r\nunpublished catalog is still the property of the Smithsonian Institution\r\nArchives, Division of Medical Sciences' Library.\r\n\r\nIt was Dr. Flint's ambition to obtain a comprehensive, worldwide\r\ncollection of all substances used as remedies. Then, in order to\r\nidentify drugs from foreign countries, he tried to collect illustrated\r\nworks on medical botany and printed pharmacopoeias of all nations having\r\nthem. He rightly defined an official pharmacopoeia as \"a book containing\r\ndirections for the identification and preparation of medicines prepared\r\nand issued with the sanction of a government or organized and\r\nauthorized medical and pharmaceutical societies. Its purpose is to\r\nestablish uniformity in the nomenclature of remedies and in the\r\ncharacter and potency of the pharmaceutical preparations. It is enacted\r\nby legislation, and thus becomes binding on all who prepare drugs or\r\nsell them for medication.\" By soliciting the help of various American\r\nconsuls and Navy officers abroad, about 16 such official pharmacopoeias\r\nwere collected, making an almost complete international representation\r\nof all available, official, drug standards. With these sources of\r\ninformation, Dr. Flint compiled and arranged an international list of\r\n_materia medica_ specimens, indicating the authorized preparations of\r\neach. By so doing, the first curator of this Section took the initiative\r\nat least in proposing and, to some extent acting, on the preparation of\r\nan international pharmacopoeia of drugs used in existing authorized\r\nformularies giving \"official synonyms, and tables showing the\r\nconstituents and comparative strength of all preparations.\"[6] This\r\nundertaking is of special importance in the history of American\r\npharmacy, since it was probably the first attempt of its kind in the\r\nUnited States.[7] In addition, colored plates and photographs of\r\nmedicinal plants were collected, forming the nucleus of the Division's\r\ncurrent collection of pictorial and photographic material related to the\r\nhistory of the health field.\r\n\r\nDr. Flint also put on exhibition 630 Chinese _materia medica_ specimens\r\nfrom the 1876 Philadelphia centennial. These had been collected\r\noriginally by the Chinese Imperial Customs Commission for the centennial\r\nand were subsequently given to this country.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, the numbered objects in the Section's register amounted to\r\n1,574 entries. In the following year, 1,590 more specimens were added,\r\nmost of them drugs in their crude state. By the end of 1883, the total\r\ncollection had reached 4,037, out of which 3,240 individual drugs in\r\ngood condition were classified and put on display. Of these, about 500\r\nspecimens with beautiful illustrations of parts of their original plants\r\nhad been mounted for exhibition. The drug exhibitions also included\r\nmaterials transferred from the Department of Agriculture in 1881, which\r\noriginally had been brought from Central America and South America for\r\nthe 1876 centennial exhibition, a variety of opium specimens from\r\nTurkey, and a number of rare drugs listed in the official formulary\r\nwhich were acquired from the Museum of Karachi in what was then India.\r\n\r\nDr. Flint commented in the _Smithsonian Annual Report_ for 1883 that the\r\ncollection of cinchona barks was especially complete. It was comprised\r\nof specimens of nearly all the natural cinchona barks of South America\r\nand every known variety of the cultivated product from the British\r\ngovernment plantations in India. In addition, there were specimens from\r\nJava, Ceylon, Mexico, and Jamaica. The Indian and Jamaican barks were\r\naccompanied by herbarium specimens of the leaf and flower (and, in some\r\ncases, the fruit) of each variety of tree from which the bark was\r\nobtained.[8]\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to protect specimens liable to attack by insects, a small\r\npiece of blotting paper moistened with chloroform was inserted\r\nunderneath the stopper in each bottle. Later on, bichloride of mercury\r\nwas found to be a better insecticide.\r\n\r\nThese early collections of the Section were brought into admirable\r\ncondition and received compliments for their organization and\r\ncompleteness. In the _Smithsonian Annual Report_ for 1883, the\r\ncollections were praised as \"superior to any other in the United States\r\nand scarcely excelled by any in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--DR. HENRY GUSTAV BEYER, the second honorary\r\ncurator of the Section of Materia Medica (1884-1887). (_Photo courtesy\r\nof American Physiological Society._)]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the apparent emphasis on the displaying of drugs, the first\r\ncurator of the Section had envisioned that the exhibits eventually would\r\nembrace the entire field of the healing arts. In the _Smithsonian Annual\r\nReport_ for 1883, Dr. Flint noted that \"in the establishment of a museum\r\ndesigned to illustrate man and his environment, it is proper that the\r\nmaterials and methods used for the prevention and cure of disease should\r\nhave a place.\" However, his plans were temporarily interrupted when his\r\nfirst term as honorary curator ended in 1884.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 1884, Dr. Henry Gustav Beyer was detailed by the Department\r\nof the Navy to become the second honorary curator of the Section of\r\nMateria Medica. As a young man, Dr. Beyer (1850-1918) had come from\r\nSaxony, Germany, to the United States and, in due course, became a\r\nnaturalized citizen. He was graduated from the Bellevue Hospital\r\nMedical College of New York City in 1876.\r\n\r\nBecause of his interest in physiological experimental research, Dr.\r\nBeyer enrolled at the Johns Hopkins University, where he was awarded a\r\nPh. D. degree in 1887. Unlike his predecessor, Dr. Beyer was primarily\r\ninterested in carrying on research on the physiological action of\r\ncertain drugs and in pharmacology. This was evident from the original\r\nscientific papers mentioned in the _Smithsonian Annual Reports_ and\r\npublished by him during the period of his curatorship from 1884 to 1887.\r\n\r\nDespite the pressure of his postgraduate studies at Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, Dr. Beyer helped in arranging and classifying the _materia\r\nmedica_ collection without trying to extend materially the scope of the\r\nSection.\r\n\r\nAfter the term of Dr. Beyer expired in 1887, Dr. Flint returned to take\r\ncharge of the Section. Surprisingly, at this time, it seems that he\r\nshowed less enthusiasm and devotion to the work of the Museum which he\r\nhad previously served so well. It could have been a disappointment\r\nresulting from a lack of evidence of any real progress in the Section\r\nsince he had left it three years before. Whatever the reasons may have\r\nbeen, the _Smithsonian Annual Reports_ show that only a few hundred\r\nspecimens were added to the _materia medica_ collections between 1887\r\nand 1890, bringing the total to 5,915 preserved in good condition.\r\nFurther curtailment of the Section's activities began in November 1891\r\nwhen Dr. Flint was again transferred to other duties for the U.S. Navy.\r\nFrom November 1891 to May 24, 1895, curatorship of the Section was\r\ncharged to five physicians of the U.S. Navy: Drs. John C. Boyd (from\r\nNovember 1891 to April 6, 1892); William S. Dixon (April 1892 to January\r\n5, 1893); C. H. White (January 1893 to July 15, 1893); C. U. Gravatt\r\n(July 1893 to January 22, 1894); R. A. Marmion (January 22, 1894 to June\r\n15, 1894); and to Medical Inspector Daniel McMurtrie (June 1894 to May\r\n24, 1895). During this interim of nearly three and a half years, there\r\nwere neither literary contributions nor additions made to the\r\ncollections of the Section that were of any significance. The reason is\r\nobvious, for all of these curators averaged less than seven months of\r\nservice which is not enough time, even for a well-trained individual, to\r\naccomplish very much in a museum. Therefore, it is easy to imagine that\r\nwhen the Secretary of the Navy detailed Dr. Flint for a third time to\r\ntake charge of the Section, he was rather discouraged. Nevertheless, at\r\nthe Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, from\r\nSeptember 18 to December 31, 1895, the _materia medica_ was represented\r\nby two displays: one on mineral waters and amounts of solid constituents\r\nin pure state; and another showing the quantities of minerals after\r\nanalysis of the composition of the human body.\r\n\r\nA similar project was undertaken in 1897 at the Tennessee Centennial\r\nExposition (May 1 to October 31) in Nashville, where there were two\r\ndisplays of _materia medica_. One showed several kinds of the cinchona\r\nbarks and the medicinal preparations made from them, and another\r\ncontaining the commercial varieties of the alkaloids of opium.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Dr. Flint's attention turned to a new phase of medical\r\nexhibition. He felt the need for a program of exhibits on the practice\r\nand the historical development of the healing arts. A change of the\r\nSection's name was deemed necessary and, thus, in 1898 the more\r\ncomprehensive title of Division of Medicine was adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Medicine (1898-1939)\r\n\r\nThe statement by L. Emmett Holt of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical\r\nResearch, that before 1906, the Smithsonian Institution was never a\r\nbeneficiary to medicine in any form,[9] is not entirely applicable. The\r\nprevious discussion has clearly shown that the U.S. National Museum's\r\ncooperation with the Navy contributed materially towards encouraging and\r\npromoting medical knowledge. Furthermore, Dr. Flint tried to bring many\r\nof his plans for this medical division of the Museum to a practical\r\nfulfillment. He devised a program for presenting medical history in a\r\nway which would be of interest both to the public and to the profession.\r\nIn order to best illustrate the history of the healing art, he divided\r\nhis subject matter into five provisional classifications according to\r\nthe _Report upon the Condition and Progress of the U.S. National Museum_\r\nduring 1898:\r\n\r\n    1. Magical medicine including exorcism, amulets, talismans,\r\n    fetishes and incantation;\r\n\r\n    2. Psychical medicine including faith cures, and hypnotism;\r\n\r\n    3. Physical and external medicine including baths, exercise,\r\n    electricity, massage, surgery, cautery, and blood-letting;\r\n\r\n    4. Internal medicine including medications and treatment used by\r\n    the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Hindus, Arabians, and Chinese;\r\n    and\r\n\r\n    5. Preventive medicine including beverages, food, soil, clothing\r\n    and habitation.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly to Dr. Flint's credit that from its early conception,\r\nfirst as Section of Materia Medica and thereafter as Division of\r\nMedicine, he planned for an all-embracing exhibition and reference\r\ncollection of the medical sciences. Until the end of the 19th century\r\nand the early years of the 20th century, crude drugs as well as\r\nprimitive and magic medicine held a more prominent place than medical\r\ninstruments in the exhibits and collections. In 1905, Flint issued his\r\nlast, known, literary contribution, \"Directions for Collecting\r\nInformation and Objects Illustrating the History of Medicine,\" in Part S\r\nof _Bulletin of the U.S. National Museum_, no. 39. The emphasis he put\r\nupon this shows Dr. Flint's interest in collecting medical and\r\npharmaceutical objects and equipment of historical value. Consequently,\r\nhe arranged new exhibits including one on American Indian medicine. A\r\nmedical historian, Fielding H. Garrison, inspected these about 1910 and,\r\nin his \"An Introduction to the History of Medicine,\" wrote of their\r\nnovelty and appeal. \"In the interesting exhibit of folk medicine in the\r\nNational Museum at Washington,\" he commented, \"a buckeye or horse\r\nchestnut (_Aesculus flavus_), an Irish potato, a rabbit's foot, a\r\nleather strap previously worn by a horse, and a carbon from an arc light\r\nare shown as sovereign charms against rheumatism. Other amulets in the\r\nWashington exhibit,\" he added, \"are the patella of a sheep and a ring\r\nmade out of a coffin nail (dug out of a graveyard) for cramps and\r\nepilepsy, a peony root to be carried in the pocket against insanity, and\r\nrare and precious stones for all and sundry diseases.\" It had been Dr.\r\nFlint's intention, besides presenting an educational display on the\r\nhistory of the medical arts, to warn the public against the perils of\r\nquackery and the faults of folk medicine, as well as to expose evils in\r\ndrug adulteration. Today, we can see actual fulfillment of these\r\nintentions in the present exhibit at the medical gallery which has been\r\nexecuted recently on the basis of scientific, historical research.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Flint's retirement from the Smithsonian Institution in 1912,\r\nthere was no replacement for over five years. Therefore, the Division\r\nof Medicine was placed, for administrative purposes, under the\r\nsupervision of the curator of the newly reestablished (1912) Division of\r\nTextiles, Frederick L. Lewton. During these years, he fought against the\r\ndispersal of the medical and _materia medica_ collections. Thus, for\r\nlack of a curator of its own, almost all new activities in the Division\r\nof Medicine were curtailed until 1917.\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 1917, Lewton addressed members of the American\r\nPharmaceutical Association inviting them to cooperate in gathering up\r\nand preserving at the National Museum the \"many unique and irreplaceable\r\nobjects\" connected with the early history of pharmacy in this country\r\nwhich could still be saved.[10] Then, on March 14, 1917, an examination\r\nwas announced by the Civil Service (held May 2) for an assistant curator\r\nfor the Division of Medicine, and the position was filled by Joseph\r\nDonner on August 16, 1917. Donner was the first full-time employee paid\r\nby the Smithsonian Institution for the curatorship of this Division. He\r\nheld the post until January 31, 1918, when he was inducted into the\r\nSanitary Corps of the United States Army. No significant activities in\r\nthe Division of Medicine were reported during these few months.\r\n\r\nMr. Donner was followed by a second, full-time, museum officer who\r\npromoted a great amount of good will towards the Division during his\r\ncuratorship of a little over 30 years. Dr. Charles Whitebread\r\n(1877-1963), the first pharmacist to head the Division, joined the\r\nSmithsonian in 1918 and remained until his retirement in 1948, the\r\nlongest service, thus far, of any individual in the Division.\r\n\r\nDr. Whitebread received his degree of Doctor of Pharmacy from the School\r\nof Pharmacy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in\r\n1911. He entered government service late in 1915, but it was not until\r\nApril 2, 1918, that he agreed to become assistant curator of the\r\nDivision of Medicine.\r\n\r\nCurator Whitebread's first year was an active and challenging one, for\r\nin this new position he began to develop a deep interest in the history\r\nof the healing arts. He made a number of important acquisitions, most of\r\nthem pertaining to pharmaceutical products, synthetic chemicals and\r\ncrude drugs. He found that many specimens from the older drug\r\ncollections had deteriorated to such an extent as to be worthless, and\r\nhe began replacing them with freshly marketed drugs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--CURATOR CHARLES WHITEBREAD inspecting, with\r\nadmiration, five drug containers from the Squibb collection (1945).\r\n(_Photo courtesy of the American Pharmaceutical Association._)]\r\n\r\nPlans were completed for the opening of new medical exhibits and\r\nadopting, with some modifications and additions, earlier classifications\r\nset by Dr. Flint. Dr. Whitebread grouped these into the following\r\nclasses: the evaluation of the healing arts; a picture display of\r\nmedical men prominent in American history;[11] a _materia medica_\r\ndisplay including the history of pharmacy; and an exhibition on\r\nSanitation and Public Hygiene[12] which was later to evolve into the\r\nHall of Health.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, Dr. Whitebread added a number of specimens of medical-dosage\r\nforms and pharmaceutical preparations to the Division's collections. He\r\nalso acquired other gifts to complete existing exhibits illustrating the\r\nbasic principles of the various schools of medicine, such as homeopathy\r\nand osteopathy--their methods, tools, and ways of thought.\r\n\r\nIn 1921, a tablet machine by the Arthur Colton Company of Detroit,\r\nMichigan, was acquired, and an exhibit illustrating vaccine and serum\r\ntherapy was installed in the medical gallery. This was followed, in\r\n1922, by a collection arranged to tell the story of the prevention and\r\ncure of specific diseases by means of biological remedies.\r\n\r\nDuring the following two years, two more exhibits related to hospital\r\nsupplies and sanitation were added to the rapidly developing Hall of\r\nHealth exhibition which was opened in 1924. A third exhibit in 1925\r\nconsisted of 96 mounted color transparencies illustrating services\r\nprovided by hospitals to promote public health. Plans for the further\r\ndevelopment of the Hall of Health continued during 1926, and contacts\r\nwere made with organizations interested in the educational aspects of\r\nthe healing arts. As a result, several new exhibits were added. In 1926,\r\nthe American Optometric Association helped in the installation of an\r\nexhibit on conservation of vision or the care of the eyes under the\r\nslogan \"Save your vision,\" as a phase of health work. Other exhibits in\r\nthe Hall at this time were: what parasites are; water pollution and how\r\nto obtain pure water; waste disposal; ventilation and healthy housing,\r\nand the importance of recreation; purification of milk and how to obtain\r\npure milk; transmission of diseases by insects and animals; how life\r\nbegins; prenatal and postnatal care and preschool care; duties of the\r\npublic health nurse; and social, oral and mental hygiene.\r\n\r\nWith the acquiring of more medical appliances and the widening of the\r\nscope of the exhibits, more and more space was needed, and attention was\r\nturned to the area of the medical gallery which had been occupied by the\r\n_materia medica_ collection for almost four decades. To gain more\r\nexhibit space, it was decided that the greater part of the crude drugs\r\nshould be removed from the exhibits and be kept as a reference\r\ncollection and for research.[13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--EXHIBIT ON EGYPTIAN AND HEBREW MEDICINE,\r\ninstalled about 1924, which was illustrated by graphs and drugs\r\nmentioned in extant records of this ancient period. (Smithsonian photo\r\n30796-C.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--EXHIBIT ON MEDICAL HISTORY during the\r\nGreco-Roman period. (Smithsonian photo 30796-D.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--EXHIBIT ON REMEDIES DERIVED FROM DRUGS of\r\nvegetable origin, displayed about mid-1930's. (Smithsonian photo\r\n30439.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1926, original patent models including those related to pharmacy,\r\nmedicine, and dentistry, were transferred from the U.S. Patent Office to\r\nthe National Museum. These patent models, together with other apothecary\r\ntools and the machines used in drug production took up most of the\r\navailable space. This unfortunate situation led Dr. Whitebread to turn\r\ndown significant medical and pharmaceutical collections offered the\r\nMuseum between 1927 and 1930. Since the patent models were devised for\r\ninventions designed to simplify the practice of the health professions,\r\nthree cases of these models were displayed in the medical gallery in the\r\nearly 1930's. Other exhibits shown during this decade included the\r\ndeception of folk medicine with warnings against superstitions, and an\r\nexhibition on osteopathy,[14] as well as dioramas on the manufacture of\r\nmedicines and their use in scientific medical treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Dr. Whitebread was an active contributor to the\r\nliterature of the health field in various periodicals, as well as in\r\npamphlets issued by the Museum and other governmental agencies (see\r\nbibliography). His literary contributions, guided by the exhibits he\r\ndesigned and the collections he acquired, were focused on the Division's\r\ncollections, such as primitive and psychic medicine and warnings against\r\nreliance on magic and superstitions in treatment, medical oddities, and\r\nthe utilization of drugs of animal origin, both past and present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Medicine and Public Health (1939-1957)\r\n\r\nAfter taking charge of the Division of Medicine in 1918, Dr. Whitebread\r\ngave special attention to public health displays. His activities in this\r\narea were accelerated after 1924 when the health exhibit at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution was inaugurated. As the exhibits in this field\r\nincreased, the Division, in 1939, took the more comprehensive title of\r\nDivision of Medicine and Public Health. Also, in 1939, Dr. Whitebread\r\nwas promoted to the rank of associate curator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--EXHIBIT ON METHODS OF TREATMENT of diseases\r\nthrough mental impressions and psychic conditions as displayed about\r\n1925. (Smithsonian photo 30796-B.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--AN EXHIBIT ON SUPERSTITIONS, EMPIRICISM,\r\nmagic, and faith healing in the light of scientific medicine, completed\r\nin 1962, is in sharp contrast with that shown in figure 9.]\r\n\r\nHe continued his efforts to collect more specimens of interest to\r\nmedical history and to contribute to the literature. Among exhibited\r\nspecimens in 1941 were a powder paper-crimping machine, a portable drug\r\ncrusher, an odd device for spreading plaster on cloth, a pill-coating\r\napparatus, various suppository molds, a lozenge cutter, and an ingenious\r\nSeidlitz powder machine. The derivation of medicinal drugs from animal,\r\nvegetable, and mineral sources was also depicted, as were synthetic\r\nmaterials and their intermediates. Basic prescription materials were\r\ndisplayed, and rows of glass-enclosed cases held samples of crude\r\nbotanical drugs from almost every part of the globe with explanatory\r\ncards giving brief, concise descriptions. The exhibition provided\r\nmedical and pharmaceutical students about to take state-board\r\nexaminations, the opportunity to study the subject in detail, especially\r\nthe enormous collection of _materia medica_ samples.[15] Also in 1941,\r\nEli Lilly and Company donated an exhibit on the medical treatment of\r\nvarious types of anemia. In the same year, a diorama including a\r\nhypochlorinator for purification of water on a farm was installed in the\r\ngallery. In 1942, the first Emerson iron lung (developed in 1931 by John\r\nHaven Emerson) for artificial respiration was acquired by the Division.\r\nThe Division acquired, in 1944, the first portable x-ray machine known\r\nto have been operated successfully on the battlefield, as well as other\r\nx-ray equipment and early medicine chests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--OLD PUBLIC HEALTH EXHIBITION installed in the\r\ngallery about 1924. (Smithsonian photo 19952.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--THE HALL OF HEALTH, reestablished and opened\r\nin November 1957. (Smithsonian photo 44931.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--EARLY EXHIBIT ON HOMEOPATHY showing its\r\nhistory, methods and remedies which was installed about 1929.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 27049.)]\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the most outstanding accession in the field of\r\npharmaceutical history during Dr. Whitebread's years of service was the\r\nacquisition of the E. R. Squibb and Sons old apothecary shop. Most of\r\nthe baroque fixtures, including the stained-glass windows with\r\nHessian-Nassau coats of arms and wrought-iron frames, were part of the\r\nmid-18th-century cathedral pharmacy \"Muenster Apotheke\" in Freiburg im\r\nBreisgau, Germany. It was offered for sale in September 1930 by Dr. Jo\r\nMayer of Wiesbaden, Germany, who was an enthusiastic collector of\r\nantiques, especially those related to the health professions. Earlier\r\nthat year, a historian of pharmacy and chemistry, Fritz Ferchl of\r\nMittenwald, Germany, had published a series of scholarly and informative\r\narticles on the Meyer collection in which the outstanding specimens were\r\nbeautifully portrayed and thoroughly described (see bibliography).\r\n\r\nAs a result of Dr. Mayer's efforts to sell his collection, the impact of\r\nFerchl's illustrated articles, and the uniqueness of the collection, E.\r\nR. Squibb and Sons purchased it in 1932 and brought it to the United\r\nStates \"with the thought that it would provide for American pharmacy,\r\nits teachers and students, a museum illuminating the history, growth,\r\nand development of pharmacy, its interesting background and struggle\r\nthrough the ages.\" It was displayed at the Century of Progress\r\nexposition held in Chicago during 1933 and 1934; subsequently, it was\r\nassembled in the Squibb Building in New York City as a private museum\r\nwhere, for about 10 years, it was visited by many interested in\r\npharmacy, ceramics, and art. Charles H. LaWall, who was originally\r\nengaged to prepare a descriptive catalog on the exhibit, gave it the\r\ntitle \"The Squibb Ancient Pharmacy.\"\r\n\r\nLate in 1943, E. R. Squibb and Sons offered the collection as a gift to\r\nthe American Pharmaceutical Association if the latter would provide\r\nmuseum space for it. The offer was accepted, but the Association\r\nfinally found it difficult to spare the needed space for the collection\r\nand decided to take up the matter with the U.S. National Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--THIS EARLY EXHIBIT ON OSTEOPATHY was\r\nrenovated several times prior to the early 1940's. (Smithsonian photo\r\n19250.)]\r\n\r\nAt this point, it should be stated that since 1883 the members of the\r\nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association have been keenly interested in\r\nhaving the National Museum serve as the custodian for all collected\r\nobjects and records of historical interest to pharmacy. In 1944, the\r\nAssociation officially offered to deposit on permanent loan, the\r\nSquibb's pharmacy collection in the Smithsonian Institution with the\r\nunderstanding that a suitable place would be provided for prompt and\r\npermanent display. The offer was accepted, and during April and May of\r\n1945, the entire collection was transferred to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, and construction to recreate the original two rooms for the\r\nold, 18th-century, European \"Apotheke\" was underway.\r\n\r\nBy August 1946, the exhibit was completed. In the large room where the\r\npharmacist met his customers, the shelves were filled with 15th-to\r\n19th-century, European pharmaceutical antiques. These included\r\nRenaissance mortars; 16th-and 17th-century nested weights; beautiful\r\nItalian, French, Swiss, and German majolica and faience drug jars; Dutch\r\nand English delft; drug containers made of flint or opal glass with\r\nfused-enamel labels with alchemical symbols; rare, 16th-century, wooden\r\ndrug containers, each with the coat of arms of the city in which each\r\nwas made; and two glass-topped, display tables contained franchises\r\nissued and signed by Popes or state rulers, medical edicts,\r\ndispensatories, herbals, pharmacopoeias, and pharmaceutical utensils.\r\n\r\nOn the walls in the small laboratory room, which also had been used as a\r\nworkshop and a study, were a stuffed crocodile, shark's head, tortoise,\r\nfish, and salamander, parts of which were utilized as remedial agents.\r\nTheir presence provided tangible evidence that the pharmacy dispensed\r\ngenuine drugs and not substitutes.\r\n\r\nThe pharmaceutical profession in this country hailed the outstanding\r\nexhibition, and the November 1946 issue of the _Journal of the American\r\nPharmaceutical Association, Practical Pharmacy Edition_, devoted its\r\nfront cover to depicting one corner of the study and laboratory room of\r\nthe shop.[16] Also, in a letter dated January 2, 1947, addressed to Dr.\r\nAlexander Wetmore, then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr.\r\nRobert P. Fischelis, the secretary of the American Pharmaceutical\r\nAssociation, considered the completion of the deposited exhibition a\r\ntriumph and \"as one of the highlights of the accomplishments of the\r\nAssociation in 1946.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--LATE 16TH-CENTURY, wooden drug container with\r\ncoat-of-arms, in the Squibb collection. The inscription _Ungula Alcis_\r\n(the hoof of the elk) suggests a superstitious attitude in medical\r\npractice and the wide use of animal organs in medical treatment.\r\n(_Courtesy of the American Pharmaceutical Association._)]\r\n\r\nFrom 1946 to 1948, the Division's collection was further enriched with\r\na number of historical specimens, among which was a \"grosse Flamme\"\r\nx-ray machine with induction-coil tube and stand developed by Albert B.\r\nKoett. It is one of the earliest American-made machines of its kind,\r\nproducing a 12-inch spark, the largest usable at that time with\r\n180,000-volt capacity, and a forerunner of later autotransformers. Other\r\naccessions included two 19th-century drug mills, an electric belt used\r\nin quackery, two medicine chests, three sets of Hessian crucibles used\r\nin a pioneer drugstore in Colorado, a drunkometer, mineral ores, and\r\npurely produced chemical elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--A RARE, ANTWERP, 16th-century drug jar in the\r\nSquibb collection deposited by the American Pharmaceutical Association.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1948, Associate Curator Whitebread retired after 30\r\nyears of service with the U.S. National Museum. He was a pioneer in the\r\nfield of health museums and during his curatorship had developed a\r\nmoribund section into a Division of field-wide importance. Dr.\r\nWhitebread was succeeded by George S. Thomas, also a pharmacist, who\r\nserved as associate curator from August 1948 until early 1952.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--THE APOTHECARY SHOP as seen in the Arts and\r\nIndustries building (1946-1964). (_Courtesy of the American\r\nPharmaceutical Association._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--VIEW OF THE LABORATORY AND STUDY ROOM of the\r\napothecary shop. On the left, the German-Swiss bronze mortar and pestle\r\n(1686) sign and above it an 18th-century German painting on canvas of\r\nChrist, \"the apothecary of the soul.\" The drug containers represent \"the\r\nfruits of the spirit,\" faith, patience, charity, etc., and the scales\r\nrepresent justice. Underneath is the verse from Matthew, 11:28, \"Come\r\nunto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you\r\nrest.\" (_Courtesy of the American Pharmaceutical Association._)]\r\n\r\nDuring his almost-three and a half years of service, Thomas acquired\r\nhearing-aid appliances from which he designed an exhibit on the\r\ndevelopment of these aids, surgical sutures, early samples of\r\nAureomycin, and a static-electricity machine made by Henkel about 1840.\r\nHe also published three short articles under the title, \"Now and Then,\"\r\nin the _National Capital Pharmacist_ (1950), no. 1, pp. 8-9; no. 2, pp.\r\n18-19, 29; and no. 3, pp. 15-16. In early 1952, Dr. Arthur O. Morton\r\npresented to the Division, a Swiss-made keratometer which he had\r\npurchased in 1907, and it is believed to be one of the first used in the\r\nUnited States to measure the curves of the cornea.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of the Division reached their highest point, thus far,\r\nin significantly increasing the national collection, as well as in\r\ncontributing to the scientific, historical, and professional literature,\r\nunder the curatorships of George B. Griffenhagen (December 8, 1952, to\r\nJune 27, 1959) and John B. Blake (July 1, 1957, to September 2, 1961).\r\nTheir reorganization of exhibits and collections, their competence and\r\nindustry, fulfilled the hopes, plans, and purposes laid down by earlier\r\ncurators for the Division.\r\n\r\nImmediately after assuming the responsibilities of the Division and\r\nthroughout 1953, Mr. Griffenhagen (M.S. in pharmaceutical chemistry from\r\nthe University of Southern California) undertook to develop the\r\ncollections still further. He increased the emphasis not only on\r\nhistorical pharmacy, but also on medicine, surgery, and dentistry. He\r\nalso renovated the exhibits in the medical gallery.\r\n\r\nIn 1954, several antibiotics were donated to the Division including a\r\nmold of _Penicillium notatum_ prepared and presented to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution by Sir Alexander Fleming (1881-1955), the discoverer of\r\npenicillium (1929), and a few Petri dishes used by botanist Benjamin M.\r\nDaggar who, while working for Lederle Laboratories, developed Aureomycin\r\n(chlortetracycline) in 1948. The Forest D. Dodrill--G.M.R. mechanical\r\nheart (1952), the first machine reported to be used successfully for the\r\ncomplete bypass of one side of the human heart during a surgical\r\noperation,[17] was presented to the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1955, the Division acquired one of the earliest\r\nEinthoven string galvanometers (named after the Dutch physiologist Willem\r\nEinthoven, 1860-1927) made in the United States in 1914 by Charles F.\r\nHindle for an electrocardiograph. Also added to the Division's\r\ncollections was the electrocardiograph used by Dr. Frank E. Wilson of\r\nthe United States, a pioneer educator in this field. Two temporary\r\nexhibits on allergy and surgical dressings were installed in the\r\ngallery. In the same year, Curator Griffenhagen published _Early\r\nAmerican Pharmacies_, a catalog on 28 pharmacy restorations in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn 1956, among many publications of interest in the fields of medical\r\nand pharmaceutical history, was Curator Griffenhagen's _Pharmacy\r\nMuseum_, with a foreword by Laurence V. Coleman, who termed it a useful\r\ncatalog and \"a good reflection of the history of the museum movement at\r\nlarge.\" A third x-ray tube of Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen (1845-1922) was\r\nadded to the collection in 1957 as well as a complete set of\r\nhospital-ward fixtures of about 1900 from the Massachusetts General\r\nHospital, rare patent medicines, 18th-century microscopes, and a\r\n13th-century mortar and pestle made in Persia.\r\n\r\nIn 1957, Mr. Griffenhagen published a series of illustrated articles in\r\nthe _Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association, Practical\r\nPharmacy Edition_, which were later reprinted by the Association in a\r\nbooklet entitled, _Tools of the Apothecary_. In it, he described several\r\npharmaceutical specimens in the collection and their place in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Medical Sciences (1957 to Present)\r\n\r\nThe U.S. National Museum was reorganized on July 1, 1957, into two\r\nunits, the Natural History Museum and the Museum of History and\r\nTechnology. At the same time, and in view of the widening scope of the\r\nDivision, its more scientifically based planning, and the constantly\r\nincreasing collection with equal emphasis on all branches of the healing\r\narts, the Division's title was changed to the Division of Medical\r\nSciences--the title it still bears in 1964. With the reorganization, the\r\nDepartment of Engineering and Industries, under which the Division fell\r\nadministratively, was renamed the Department of Science and Technology\r\nof the Museum of History and Technology. It was also the first time\r\nsince its establishment in 1881 that the Division had two curators, for\r\non July 1, 1957, Dr. John B. Blake joined the staff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--CURATORS JOHN B. BLAKE AND GEORGE\r\nGRIFFENHAGEN examine the newly acquired (1957) electromagnetic,\r\nMorton-Wimshurst-Holz Influence Machine. It was manufactured by the\r\nBowen Company of Providence, Rhode Island (1889). With the discovery of\r\nx-ray, it was used for making x-ray photographs until early in the 20th\r\ncentury.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of these changes, the Division was subdivided into a Section\r\nof Pharmaceutical History and Health and a Section of Medical and Dental\r\nHistory. The former was planned to encompass the collections of _materia\r\nmedica_, pharmaceutical equipment, and all material related to the\r\nhistory of pharmacy, toxicology, pharmacology, and biochemistry, as well\r\nas the Hall of Health which was opened November 2, 1957, and which\r\nemphasizes man's progressing knowledge of his body and the functions of\r\nits major organs.[18] The latter Section was planned to include all that\r\nbelongs to the development of surgery, medicine, dentistry, and nursing,\r\nespecially in relation to hospitals.\r\n\r\nIn October 1957, the Division acquired a collection of rare, ceramic,\r\ndrug jars which included two, 13th-century, North Syrian and Persian,\r\nalbarello-shaped, majolica jars; a 15th-century, Hispano-Moresque drug\r\ncontainer; and a 16th-century, Italian faience, dragon-spout ewer.\r\nDuring the following two years, Curator Griffenhagen periodically toured\r\nmuseums and medical and pharmaceutical institutions in this country,\r\nSouth America, and Europe gathering specimens and information for the\r\nDivision and for publication, respectively. However, on June 27, 1959,\r\nhe resigned his curatorship to join the staff of the American\r\nPharmaceutical Association in Washington, D.C. Dr. Blake became the\r\ncurator in charge of the Division and Mr. Griffenhagen was succeeded on\r\nSeptember 24, 1959, by the author of this paper as associate curator in\r\ncharge of the Section of Pharmaceutical History and Health.\r\n\r\nDr. Blake, as curator of the Section of Medical and Dental History,\r\nacquired a large number of valuable and varied specimens for the\r\nDivision's collections. They included optometric refracting instruments,\r\nan early 1920's General Electric, portable, x-ray machine, the Charles\r\nA. Lindbergh and Alexis Carrel pump (designed in 1935 to perfuse\r\nlife-sustaining fluids to the organs of the body), the Sewell heart pump\r\n(1950) to control delivery of air pressure and suction to the pumping\r\nmechanism, and a large and valuable collection of dental equipment\r\nformerly at the universities of Pennsylvania and Illinois. Dr. Blake\r\nwrote the explanatory material and supervised the design and production\r\nof the majority of exhibits in the renovated hall of medical and dental\r\nhistory. He also contributed several scholarly articles and a book (see\r\nbibliography) on the history of the healing arts and public health in\r\nparticular. He resigned on September 2, 1961, to join the staff of the\r\nNational Library of Medicine as chief of the History of Medicine\r\nDivision, and was succeeded by the author as curator of the Division.\r\nFrom the summer of 1962 to April 1964, the Division benefited from the\r\nexpert advice of Dr. Alfred R. Henderson as consultant in the\r\npreparation and designing of the surgical and medical exhibits of the\r\nMuseum of History and Technology.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 1961 to May 1964, the Division's collections\r\nexpanded greatly through its medical, dental, and pharmaceutical\r\nacquisitions. Specimens of antiques acquired from 1961 through 1963\r\nnumbered up to 1,539 and included gifts from leading institutions and\r\nindividual philanthropists. The scope of these gifts and acquisitions\r\nranges from electronic resuscitators, microscopes, x-ray equipment, and\r\nspectacles, to patent medicines, amulets, apothecary tools, dental\r\ninstruments, and office material of practitioners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--EXHIBIT ON SPECTACLES, LORGNETTES,\r\nOPTOMETERS, and refraction, completed in 1960. It features a cross\r\nsection of the Division's large collection of eyeglasses. (Smithsonian\r\nphoto 47943-D.)]\r\n\r\nIn the last decade, the interest in the national endeavor for promoting\r\nresearch and scholarship in the history of medicine has increased\r\ngreatly. It was most appropriate, therefore, for the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution to play host on May 2 for two sessions of the 37th annual\r\nmeeting of the American Association for the History of Medicine held in\r\nthe Washington, D.C., area from April 30 through May 2, 1964. In\r\nwelcoming the members to the morning session in the auditorium of the\r\nnew Museum of History and Technology, Frank A. Taylor, director of the\r\nUnited States National Museum, expressed the feeling that the meeting of\r\nthe Association was, in a sense, a dedication of the new auditorium and\r\nan opportunity for the Smithsonian to reaffirm its deep interest and\r\ncommitment in fostering research and furthering the appreciation of\r\nscholarly endeavor in the history of the healing arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA New Dimension For the Healing Arts\r\n\r\n\"One day the United States will have a National Museum of science,\r\nengineering, and industry, as most large nations have.\" This was the\r\nprediction made in 1946 by the director of the U.S. National Museum, Mr.\r\nFrank A. Taylor, then curator of the Division of Engineering.[19] It was\r\nin 1963, that the new $36,000,000 building of the Museum of History\r\nand Technology was completed, and opened to the public in 1964. The\r\noffices of the Division of Medical Sciences as well as the reference and\r\nstudy collections were moved to the fifth floor of the new building. The\r\nexhibits, however, will be displayed in the gallery at the southwest\r\ncorner of the first floor. These exhibits, it is hoped, will show a new\r\ndimension and an unprecedented approach in displaying the development of\r\nthe healing arts throughout the ages and the instruments and equipment\r\nassociated with health professions. They also present the expanding\r\nobjectives and plans of the Division's growth as an integral part of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. Conveniently, the exhibits form four, closely\r\nconnected halls in one large gallery which will be open to the public in\r\nthe summers of 1965 to 1966.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--EXHIBIT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLOOD-PRESSURE\r\nINSTRUMENTS and the early 20th-century sphygmomanometers which was\r\ncompleted in 1960. (Smithsonian photo 47943-M.)]\r\n\r\n1. THE HALL OF HEALTH displays models and graphic and historical exhibit\r\nmaterials to demonstrate the function of the various healthy organs of\r\nthe human body. The main topics emphasized are: embryology and\r\nchildbirth; tooth structure; the heart and blood circulation;\r\nrespiration; the endocrine glands; kidneys and the urinary-excretory\r\nsystem; the brain and the nervous system; the ear; and vision and the\r\nuse of eyeglasses.\r\n\r\nThe most appreciated exhibit of all in this Hall is the \"transparent\r\nwoman\" figure which rotates, automatically, every 15 minutes with a\r\nrecorded message describing the function of each major organ of the body\r\nat the same time that the organ is electronically lighted, so that the\r\nviewer can see its place in the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--HEARING-AID EXHIBIT designed in 1962. It\r\nincludes otologist Julius Lempert's personal memorabilia and original\r\nsurgical instruments used in the fenestration operation for restoring\r\nhearing. (Smithsonian photo 49345-C.)]\r\n\r\n2. THE HALL OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY will depict the history of these\r\ntwo sciences with exhibits of the equipment used through the centuries.\r\nIn the medical field, early trephining and other surgical instruments\r\nwill be displayed along with a diorama of an 1805 surgical operation\r\nperformed by Dr. Philip Syng Physick in the amphitheater of the\r\nPennsylvania Hospital. Diagnostic instruments such as stethoscopes,\r\nendoscopes, speculums, and blood-pressure measuring devices will be\r\nexhibited with a series of microscopes illustrating the development of\r\nthese instruments. Exhibits of original galvanometers and other\r\napparatus will trace the development of cardiography. The early use of\r\nanesthesia will be shown by apparatus of William Morton and Crawford W.\r\nLong, American pioneers in this field. The development of the devices of\r\nmodern medicine and surgery will be shown by exhibits of the iron lung\r\nand x-ray tubes, including a tube used by W. K. Roentgen. Medicine\r\nchests and surgical kits of different periods will graphically summarize\r\nthe state of medical science in the period each represents.\r\n\r\nExhibits on the development of dentistry and dental surgery will display\r\nexamples of tooth-filling and extracting tools, drilling apparatus from\r\nthe early hand and foot engines to the first ultrasonic cutting\r\ninstrument (1954), and the original contra-angle, hydraulic and\r\nair-turbine handpiece model[20] which revolutionized the field of\r\ninstrumentation for dental surgery (with speeds of 200,000 to 400,000\r\nrpm). This hydraulic turbine of Dr. Robert J. Nelson and associates of\r\nthe National Bureau of Standards set the design pattern for the\r\nremarkable and successful high-speed, air-turbine handpiece developed by\r\nPaul H. Tanner and Oscar P. Nagel of the U.S. Naval Dental School in\r\n1956. Also underway is the reconstruction of the offices of famous\r\ndentists such as G. V. Black and the father of American orthodontia,\r\nEdward H. Angle, using their original equipment and instruments. In\r\naddition, an exhibit is planned to include x-ray tubes and the electric\r\ndental engine, the first to be operated in a human mouth by the pioneer\r\ndentist on dental skiagraphy, Charles E. Kells (1856-1928).[21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--EXHIBIT ON NURSING BOTTLES and measures to\r\npromote child health to counteract the once-common diseases of\r\nchildhood. This display was completed in 1962. (Smithsonian photo\r\n49345-G.)]\r\n\r\n3. THE HALL OF PHARMACEUTICAL HISTORY will feature exhibits on the\r\nreconstruction of two pharmacy shops: an 18th-century apothecary shop,\r\noriginally from Germany, with a very elegant collection of drug jars,\r\ndecorated medicinal bottles, balances, mortars and pestles, and other\r\ntools and documents pertaining to the apothecary art, and a late\r\n19th-century American drugstore with shelves filled with patent\r\nmedicines and drug containers of various sizes and shapes. The window\r\nwill also feature symbols of pharmacy and beautiful show globes.\r\nDisplays will show the development of antibiotics and the early tools\r\nused in the manufacture of the so-called \"miracle drugs,\" including a\r\nmold from Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. In\r\naddition, a platform will be reconstructed to display a variety of\r\npharmaceutical apparatus used in the preparation and manufacture of\r\ndrugs, such as tablet and capsule machines and drug mills and\r\npercolators. Recently, with the assistance of Professor Glenn\r\nSonnedecker, the Division acquired a fine collection of pharmaceutical\r\nequipment and devices from the School of Pharmacy of the University of\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--THE ORIGINS OF DRUGS from the three natural\r\nkingdoms, drug synthesis, and the increase in the manufacture of\r\nvitamins. This display was completed in 1962 and is now on display at\r\nthe Museum of History and Technology. (Smithsonian photo P6316.)]\r\n\r\nSince the Division houses the largest collection of _materia medica_ in\r\nthe country, a representative cross section of crude drugs will be\r\ndisplayed in alphabetical order as well as a display illustrating the\r\nrole of cinchona and antimalarial drugs in the fight against disease. An\r\nexhibit will portray the \"origin of drugs\" from the three natural\r\nkingdoms, animal, vegetable, and mineral, together with synthetic drugs\r\nincluding the manufacture of vitamins.\r\n\r\nPlans are being made for an elaborate exhibit of weights and balances\r\nused in many countries throughout the centuries, their impact on\r\naccuracy of dosage and weighing of drugs, and their use in the\r\napothecary art.\r\n\r\nThe Division will also display pictorial and printed materials, as well\r\nas artifacts from all periods and all countries. These collections are\r\nintended to help in presenting a more complete picture of the story of\r\nthe medical sciences for educational purposes and research, and to\r\nincrease man's knowledge in fighting disease and promoting health.\r\n\r\nThus, from a few hundred specimens of crude drugs in the Section of\r\nMateria Medica of 83 years ago, there has developed a Museum Division\r\ntoday which embraces the evolution of the health professions through the\r\nages. This Division now has the largest collection in the Western\r\nHemisphere of historical objects which are related to the healing arts.\r\nThe reference collections are available to the researcher and scholar,\r\nand the exhibits are intended for pleasure and educational purposes in\r\nthese fields. The plans for expansion have no limitation as we keep pace\r\nwith man's progress in the medical sciences and continue to collect\r\nmaterials that contributed to the historical development in the fight\r\nagainst diseases and the attempts to secure better health for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian\r\n    Institution_ from 1872 to date and the _Proceedings of the\r\n    United States National Museum_ from 1881 to date were used\r\n    extensively as sources in this survey.

Dr. Flint in his article\r\n      \"Report on Pharmacopoeias of All Nations,\" ibid., pp. 655-680,\r\n      remarks that there were then 19 official pharmacopoeias in the\r\n      world, besides three semiofficial formularies in certain\r\n      localities in Italy. The pharmacopoeias collected represent\r\n      Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Holland,\r\n      India, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland (two),\r\n      and the United States.\r\n\r\n  [7] The _Universal Formulary_, by R. Eglesfeld Griffith, first edited\r\n      in March 1850 (3rd ed. rev. and enlarged by John M. Maisch,\r\n      Philadelphia: Lea, 1874) should not be considered an international\r\n      drug standard. It was mainly concerned with compiling a great\r\n      number of formulas and recipes, methods of preparing and\r\n      administering official and other medicines, and tables on weights\r\n      and measures for utilization by the U.S. practitioners of the\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n  [8] Other elaborate arrangements were also made to improve and expand\r\n      the Section's activities and services, though some have never\r\n      materialized. For example, a herbarium was suggested from which\r\n      specimens could be obtained for display of the actual drug with\r\n      painted pictures of its plant next to it. Consideration was given\r\n      to displaying enlarged drawings to show the minute structure of\r\n      the specimen for better identification. In addition, an exhibition\r\n      of several 10-liter vessels of the most popular mineral waters was\r\n      planned. The amount of saline substances which analysis had shown\r\n      to be present in each vessel was to be listed in a table to be\r\n      attached to that vessel, or the same amount of minerals was to be\r\n      put in a small bottle beside it. This plan was carried out to the\r\n      best advantage at the Cotton States and International Exposition\r\n      held in 1895 in Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\n  [9] HOLT, \"A Sketch of the Development of the Rockefeller Institute\r\n      for Medical Research,\" p. 1.

In order to\r\ntest the effect of the earth's rotation on its gravitational force, the\r\nAcademy in 1672 sent Jean Richer to the equatorial island of Cayenne to\r\ncompare the rate of a clock which was known to have kept accurate time\r\nin Paris. Richer found that the clock lost 2 minutes and 28 seconds at\r\nCayenne, indicating a substantial decrease in the force of gravity on\r\nthe pendulum. Subsequent pendulum experiments revealed that the period\r\nof a pendulum varied not only with the latitude but also regionally,\r\nunder the influence of topographical features such as mountains. It\r\nbecame clear that the measurement of gravity should be made a part of\r\nthe work of the geodetic surveyor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The history of gravity pendulums dates back to the time of\r\n    Galileo. After the discovery of the variation of the force of\r\n    gravity over the surface of the earth, gravity measurement\r\n    became a major concern of physics and geodesy. This article\r\n    traces the history of the development of instruments for this\r\n    purpose._\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHORS: _Victor F. Lenzen is Professor of Physics,\r\n    Emeritus, at the University of California at Berkeley and Robert\r\n    P. Multhauf is Chairman of the Department of Science and\r\n    Technology in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History\r\n    and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intensity of gravity, or the acceleration of a freely falling body,\r\nis an important physical quantity for the several physical sciences. The\r\nintensity of gravity determines the weight of a standard pound or\r\nkilogram as a standard or unit of force. In physical experiments, the\r\nforce on a body may be measured by determining the weight of a known\r\nmass which serves to establish equilibrium against it. Thus, in the\r\nabsolute determination of the ampere with a current balance, the force\r\nbetween two coils carrying current is balanced by the earth's\r\ngravitational force upon a body of determinable mass. The intensity of\r\ngravity enters into determinations of the size of the earth from the\r\nangular velocity of the moon, its distance from the earth, and Newton's\r\ninverse square law of gravitation and the laws of motion. Prediction\r\nof the motion of an artificial satellite requires an accurate knowledge\r\nof gravity for this astronomical problem.\r\n\r\nThe gravity field of the earth also provides data for a determination of\r\nthe figure of the earth, or geoid, but for this problem of geodesy\r\nrelative values of gravity are sufficient. If g is the intensity of\r\ngravity at some reference station, and [Delta]g is the difference\r\nbetween intensities at two stations, the values of gravity in geodetic\r\ncalculations enter as ratios ([Delta]g)/g over the surface of the earth.\r\nGravimetric investigations in conjunction with other forms of\r\ngeophysical investigation, such as seismology, furnish data to test\r\nhypotheses concerning the internal structure of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhether the intensity of gravity is sought in absolute or relative\r\nmeasure, the most widely used instrument for its determination since the\r\ncreation of classical mechanics has been the pendulum. In recent\r\ndecades, there have been invented gravity meters based upon the\r\nprinciple of the spring, and these instruments have made possible the\r\nrapid determination of relative values of gravity to a high degree of\r\naccuracy. The gravity meter, however, must be calibrated at stations\r\nwhere the absolute value of gravity has been determined by other means\r\nif absolute values are sought. For absolute determinations of gravity,\r\nthe pendulum historically has been the principal instrument employed.\r\nAlthough alternative methods of determining absolute values of gravity\r\nare now in use, the pendulum retains its value for absolute\r\ndeterminations, and even retains it for relative determinations, as is\r\nexemplified by the Cambridge Pendulum Apparatus and that of the Dominion\r\nObservatory at Ottawa, Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe pendulums employed for absolute or relative determinations of\r\ngravity have been of two basic types. The first form of pendulum used as\r\na physical instrument consisted of a weight suspended by a fiber, cord,\r\nor fine wire, the upper end of which was attached to a fixed support.\r\nSuch a pendulum may be called a \"simple\" pendulum; the enclosure of the\r\nword simple by quotation marks is to indicate that such a pendulum is an\r\napproximation to a simple, or mathematical pendulum, a conceptual object\r\nwhich consists of a mass-point suspended by a weightless inextensible\r\ncord. If l is the length of the simple pendulum, the time of swing\r\n(half-period in the sense of physics) for vibrations of infinitely small\r\namplitude, as derived from Newton's laws of motion and the hypothesis\r\nthat weight is proportional to mass, is T = [pi][sqrt](l/g).\r\n\r\nThe second form of pendulum is the compound, or physical, pendulum. It\r\nconsists of an extended solid body which vibrates about a fixed axis\r\nunder the action of the weight of the body. A compound pendulum may be\r\nconstituted to oscillate about one axis only, in which case it is\r\nnonreversible and applicable only for relative measurements. Or a\r\ncompound pendulum may be constituted to oscillate about two axes, in\r\nwhich case it is reversible (or \"convertible\") and may be used to\r\ndetermine absolute values of gravity. Capt. Henry Kater, F.R.S., during\r\nthe years 1817-1818 was the first to design, construct, and use a\r\ncompound pendulum for the absolute determination of gravity. He\r\nconstructed a convertible pendulum with two knife edges and with it\r\ndetermined the absolute value of gravity at the house of Henry Browne,\r\nF.R.S., in Portland Place, London. He then constructed a similar\r\ncompound pendulum with only one knife edge, and swung it to determine\r\nrelative values of gravity at a number of stations in the British Isles.\r\nThe 19th century witnessed the development of the theory and practice of\r\nobservations with pendulums for the determination of absolute and\r\nrelative values of gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGalileo, Huygens, and Newton\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pendulum has been both an objective and an instrument of physical\r\ninvestigation since the foundations of classical mechanics were\r\nfashioned in the 17th century.[1] It is tradition that the youthful\r\nGalileo discovered that the period of oscillation of a pendulum is\r\nconstant by observations of the swings of the great lamp suspended from\r\nthe ceiling in the cathedral of Pisa.[2] The lamp was only a rough\r\napproximation to a simple pendulum, but Galileo later performed more\r\naccurate experiments with a \"simple\" pendulum which consisted of a heavy\r\nball suspended by a cord. In an experiment designed to confirm his laws\r\nof falling bodies, Galileo lifted the ball to the level of a given\r\naltitude and released it. The ball ascended to the same level on the\r\nother side of the vertical equilibrium position and thereby confirmed a\r\nprediction from the laws. Galileo also discovered that the period of\r\nvibration of a \"simple\" pendulum varies as the square root of its\r\nlength, a result which is expressed by the formula for the time of\r\nswing of the ideal simple pendulum. He also used a pendulum to measure\r\nlapse of time, and he designed a pendulum clock. Galileo's experimental\r\nresults are important historically, but have required correction in the\r\nlight of subsequent measurements of greater precision.\r\n\r\nMersenne in 1644 made the first determination of the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum,[3] that is, the length of a simple pendulum that beats\r\nseconds (half-period in the sense of physics). Subsequently, he proposed\r\nthe problem to determine the length of the simple pendulum equivalent in\r\nperiod to a given compound pendulum. This problem was solved by Huygens,\r\nwho in his famous work _Horologium oscillatorium_ ... (1673) set forth\r\nthe theory of the compound pendulum.[4]\r\n\r\nHuygens derived a theorem which has provided the basis for the\r\nemployment of the reversible compound pendulum for the absolute\r\ndetermination of the intensity of gravity. The theorem is that a given\r\ncompound pendulum possesses conjugate points on opposite sides of the\r\ncenter of gravity; about these points, the periods of oscillation are\r\nthe same. For each of these points as center of suspension the other\r\npoint is the center of oscillation, and the distance between them is the\r\nlength of the equivalent simple pendulum. Earlier, in 1657, Huygens\r\nindependently had invented and patented the pendulum clock, which\r\nrapidly came into use for the measurement of time. Huygens also created\r\nthe theory of centripetal force which made it possible to calculate the\r\neffect of the rotation of the earth upon the observed value of gravity.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the gravity field of the earth was founded upon the laws\r\nof motion and the law of gravitation by Isaac Newton in his famous\r\n_Principia_ (1687). It follows from the Newtonian theory of gravitation\r\nthat the acceleration of gravity as determined on the surface of the\r\nearth is the resultant of two factors: the principal factor is the\r\ngravitational attraction of the earth upon bodies, and the subsidiary\r\nfactor is the effect of the rotation of the earth. A body at rest on the\r\nsurface of the earth requires some of the gravitational attraction for\r\nthe centripetal acceleration of the body as it is carried in a circle\r\nwith constant speed by the rotation of the earth about its axis. If the\r\nrotating earth is used as a frame of reference, the effect of the\r\nrotation is expressed as a centrifugal force which acts to diminish the\r\nobserved intensity of gravity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF GRAVITY TERMINOLOGY\r\n\r\nABSOLUTE GRAVITY: the value of the acceleration of gravity, also\r\nexpressed by the length of the seconds pendulum.\r\n\r\nRELATIVE GRAVITY: the value of the acceleration of gravity relative to\r\nthe value at some standard point.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE PENDULUM: see theoretical pendulum.\r\n\r\nTHEORETICAL PENDULUM: a heavy bob (point-mass) at the end of a\r\nweightless rod.\r\n\r\nSECONDS PENDULUM: a theoretical or simple pendulum of such length that\r\nits time of swing (half-period) is one second. (This length is about one\r\nmeter.)\r\n\r\nGRAVITY PENDULUM: a precisely made pendulum used for the measurement of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND PENDULUM: a pendulum in which the supporting rod is not\r\nweightless; in other words, any actual pendulum.\r\n\r\nCONVERTIBLE PENDULUM: a compound pendulum having knife edges at\r\ndifferent distances from the center of gravity. Huygens demonstrated\r\n(1673) that if such a pendulum were to swing with equal periods from\r\neither knife edge, the distance between those knife edges would be equal\r\nto the length of a theoretical or simple pendulum of the same period.\r\n\r\nREVERSIBLE PENDULUM: a convertible pendulum which is also symmetrical in\r\nform.\r\n\r\nINVARIABLE PENDULUM: a compound pendulum with only one knife edge, used\r\nfor relative measurement of gravity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Newton's laws of motion and the hypothesis that weight is\r\nproportional to mass, the formula for the half-period of a simple\r\npendulum is given by T = [pi][sqrt](l/g). If a simple pendulum beats\r\nseconds, 1 = [pi][sqrt]([lambda]/g), where [lambda] is the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum. From T = [pi][sqrt](l/g) and 1 = [pi][sqrt]([lambda]/g),\r\nit follows that [lambda] = l/T^{2}. Then g = [pi]^{2}[lambda]. Thus, the\r\nintensity of gravity can be expressed in terms of the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum, as well as by the acceleration of a freely falling\r\nbody. During the 19th century, gravity usually was expressed in terms of\r\nthe length of the seconds pendulum, but present practice is to express\r\ngravity in terms of g, for which the unit is the gal, or one centimeter\r\nper second per second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--THIS DRAWING, FROM RICHER'S _Observations\r\nastronomiques et physiques faites en l'isle de Caienne_ (Paris, 1679),\r\nshows most of the astronomical instruments used by Richer, namely, one\r\nof the two pendulum clocks made by Thuret, the 20-foot and the 5-foot\r\ntelescopes and the large quadrant. The figure may be intended as a\r\nportrait of Richer. This drawing was done by Sebastian Le Clerc, a young\r\nillustrator who made many illustrations of the early work of the Paris\r\nAcademy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure of the Earth\r\n\r\n\r\nA principal contribution of the pendulum as a physical instrument has\r\nbeen the determination of the figure of the earth.[5] That the earth\r\nis spherical in form was accepted doctrine among the ancient Greeks.\r\nPythagoras is said to have been the first to describe the earth as a\r\nsphere, and this view was adopted by Eudoxus and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe Alexandrian scientist Eratosthenes made the first estimate of the\r\ndiameter and circumference of a supposedly spherical earth by an\r\nastronomical-geodetic method. He measured the angle between the\r\ndirections of the rays of the sun at Alexandria and Syene (Aswan),\r\nEgypt, and estimated the distance between these places from the length\r\nof time required by a caravan of camels to travel between them. From the\r\ncentral angle corresponding to the arc on the surface, he calculated the\r\nradius and hence the circumference of the earth. A second measurement\r\nwas undertaken by Posidonius, who measured the altitudes of stars at\r\nAlexandria and Rhodes and estimated the distance between them from the\r\ntime required to sail from one place to the other.\r\n\r\nWith the decline of classical antiquity, the doctrine of the spherical\r\nshape of the earth was lost, and only one investigation, that by the\r\nArabs under Calif Al-Mamun in A.D. 827, is recorded until the 16th\r\ncentury. In 1525, the French mathematician Fernel measured the length of\r\na degree of latitude between Paris and Amiens by the revolutions of the\r\nwheels of his carriage, the circumference of which he had determined. In\r\nEngland, Norwood in 1635 measured the length of an arc between London\r\nand York with a chain. An important forward step in geodesy was the\r\nmeasurement of distance by triangulation, first by Tycho Brahe, in\r\nDenmark, and later, in 1615, by Willebrord Snell, in Holland.\r\n\r\nOf historic importance, was the use of telescopes in the triangulation\r\nfor the measurement of a degree of arc by the Abbe Jean Picard in\r\n1669.[6] He had been commissioned by the newly established Academy of\r\nSciences to measure an arc corresponding to an angle of 1 deg., 22', 55\"\r\nof the meridian between Amiens and Malvoisine, near Paris. Picard proposed\r\nto the Academy the measurement of the meridian of Paris through all of\r\nFrance, and this project was supported by Colbert, who obtained the\r\napproval of the King. In 1684, Giovanni-Domenico Cassini and De la Hire\r\ncommenced a trigonometrical measure of an arc south of Paris;\r\nsubsequently, Jacques Cassini, the son of Giovanni-Domenico, added the\r\narc to the north of Paris. The project was completed in 1718. The length\r\nof a degree of arc south of Paris was found to be greater than the\r\nlength north of Paris. From the difference, 57,097 toises[7] minus\r\n56,960 toises, it was concluded that the polar diameter of the earth is\r\nlarger than the equatorial diameter, i.e., that the earth is a prolate\r\nspheroid (fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--MEASUREMENTS OF THE LENGTH of a degree of\r\nlatitude which were completed in different parts of France in 1669 and\r\n1718 gave differing results which suggested that the shape of the earth\r\nis not a sphere but a prolate spheroid (1). But Richer's pendulum\r\nobservation of 1672, as explained by Huygens and Newton, indicated that\r\nits shape is that of an oblate spheroid (2). The disagreement is\r\nreflected in this drawing. In the 1730's it was resolved in favor of the\r\nlatter view by two French geodetic expeditions for the measurement of\r\ndegrees of latitude in the equatorial and polar regions (Ecuador--then\r\npart of Peru--and Lapland).]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Richer in 1672 had been sent to Cayenne, French Guiana, to\r\nmake astronomical observations and to measure the length of the seconds\r\npendulum.[8] He took with him a pendulum clock which had been adjusted\r\nto keep accurate time in Paris. At Cayenne, however, Richer found that\r\nthe clock was retarded by 2 minutes and 28 seconds per day (fig. 1). He\r\nalso fitted up a \"simple\" pendulum to vibrate in seconds and measured\r\nthe length of this seconds pendulum several times every week for 10\r\nmonths. Upon his return to Paris, he found that the length of the\r\n\"simple\" pendulum which beat seconds at Cayenne was 1-1/4 Paris lines[9]\r\nshorter than the length of the seconds pendulum at Paris. Huygens\r\nexplained the reduction in the length of the seconds pendulum--and,\r\ntherefore, the lesser intensity of gravity at the equator with respect\r\nto the value at Paris--in terms of his theory of centripetal force as\r\napplied to the rotation of the earth and pendulum.[10]\r\n\r\nA more complete theory was given by Newton in the _Principia_.[11]\r\nNewton showed that if the earth is assumed to be a homogeneous, mutually\r\ngravitating fluid globe, its rotation will result in a bulging at the\r\nequator. The earth will then have the form of an oblate spheroid, and\r\nthe intensity of gravity as a form of universal gravitation will vary\r\nwith position on the surface of the earth. Newton took into account\r\ngravitational attraction and centrifugal action, and he calculated the\r\nratio of the axes of the spheroid to be 230:229. He calculated and\r\nprepared a table of the lengths of a degree of latitude and of the\r\nseconds pendulum for every 5 deg. of latitude from the equator to the\r\npole. A discrepancy between his predicted length of the seconds pendulum\r\nat the equator and Richer's measured length was explained by Newton in\r\nterms of the expansion of the scale with higher temperatures near the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nNewton's theory that the earth is an oblate spheroid was confirmed by\r\nthe measurements of Richer, but was rejected by the Paris Academy of\r\nSciences, for it contradicted the results of the Cassinis, father and\r\nson, whose measurements of arcs to the south and north of Paris had led\r\nto the conclusion that the earth is a prolate spheroid. Thus, a\r\ncontroversy arose between the English scientists and the Paris Academy.\r\nThe conflict was finally resolved by the results of expeditions sent by\r\nthe Academy to Peru and Sweden. The first expedition, under Bouguer, La\r\nCondamine, and Godin in 1735, went to a region in Peru, and, with the\r\nhelp of the Spaniard Ullo, measured a meridian arc of about 3 deg. 7'\r\nnear Quito, now in Ecuador.[12] The second expedition, with Maupertuis\r\nand Clairaut in 1736, went to Lapland within the Arctic Circle and\r\nmeasured an arc of about 1 deg. in length.[13] The northern arc of 1 deg.\r\nwas found to be longer than the Peruvian arc of 1 deg., and thus it was\r\nconfirmed that the earth is an oblate spheroid, that is, flattened at\r\nthe poles, as predicted by the theory of Newton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--THE DIRECT USE OF A CLOCK to measure the force\r\nof gravity was found to be limited in accuracy by the necessary\r\nmechanical connection of the pendulum to the clock, and by the\r\nunavoidable difference between the characteristics of a clock pendulum\r\nand those of a theoretical (usually called \"simple\") pendulum, in which\r\nthe mass is concentrated in the bob, and the supporting rod is\r\nweightless.\r\n\r\nAfter 1735, the clock was used only to time the swing of a detached\r\npendulum, by the method of \"coincidences.\" In this method, invented by\r\nJ. J. Mairan, the length of the detached pendulum is first accurately\r\nmeasured, and the clock is corrected by astronomical observation. The\r\ndetached pendulum is then swung before the clock pendulum as shown here.\r\nThe two pendulums swing more or less out of phase, coming into\r\ncoincidence each time one has gained a vibration. By counting the number\r\nof coincidences over several hours, the period of the detached pendulum\r\ncan be very accurately determined. The length and period of the detached\r\npendulum are the data required for the calculation of the force of\r\ngravity.]\r\n\r\nThe period from Eratosthenes to Picard has been called the spherical era\r\nof geodesy; the period from Picard to the end of the 19th century has\r\nbeen called the ellipsoidal period. During the latter period the earth\r\nwas conceived to be an ellipsoid, and the determination of its\r\nellipticity, that is, the difference of equatorial radius and polar\r\nradius divided by the equatorial radius, became an important geodetic\r\nproblem. A significant contribution to the solution of this problem was\r\nmade by determinations of gravity by the pendulum.\r\n\r\nAn epoch-making work during the ellipsoidal era of geodesy was\r\nClairaut's treatise, _Theorie de la figure de la terre_.[14] On the\r\nhypothesis that the earth is a spheroid of equilibrium, that is, such\r\nthat a layer of water would spread all over it, and that the internal\r\ndensity varies so that layers of equal density are coaxial spheroids,\r\nClairaut derived a historic theorem: If [gamma]_{E}, [gamma]_{P} are the\r\nvalues of gravity at the equator and pole, respectively, and c the\r\ncentrifugal force at the equator divided by [gamma]_{E}, then the\r\nellipticity [alpha] = (5/2)c - ([gamma]_{P} - [gamma]_{E})/[gamma]_{E}.\r\n\r\nLaplace showed that the surfaces of equal density might have any nearly\r\nspherical form, and Stokes showed that it is unnecessary to assume any\r\nlaw of density as long as the external surface is a spheroid of\r\nequilibrium.[15] It follows from Clairaut's theorem that if the earth is\r\nan oblate spheroid, its ellipticity can be determined from relative\r\nvalues of gravity and the absolute value at the equator involved in c.\r\nObservations with nonreversible, invariable compound pendulums have\r\ncontributed to the application of Clairaut's theorem in its original and\r\ncontemporary extended form for the determination of the figure and\r\ngravity field of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Types of Pendulums\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pendulum employed in observations of gravity prior to the 19th\r\ncentury usually consisted of a small weight suspended by a filament\r\n(figs. 4-6). The pioneer experimenters with \"simple\" pendulums changed\r\nthe length of the suspension until the pendulum beat seconds. Picard in\r\n1669 determined the length of the seconds pendulum at Paris with a\r\n\"simple\" pendulum which consisted of a copper ball an inch in diameter\r\nsuspended by a fiber of pite from jaws (pite was a preparation of the\r\nleaf of a species of aloe and was not affected appreciably by moisture).\r\n\r\nA celebrated set of experiments with a \"simple\" pendulum was conducted\r\nby Bouguer[16] in 1737 in the Andes, as part of the expedition to\r\nmeasure the Peruvian arc. The bob of the pendulum was a double\r\ntruncated cone, and the length was measured from the jaw suspension to\r\nthe center of oscillation of the thread and bob. Bouguer allowed for\r\nchange of length of his measuring rod with temperature and also for the\r\nbuoyancy of the air. He determined the time of swing by an elementary\r\nform of the method of coincidences. The thread of the pendulum was swung\r\nin front of a scale and Bouguer observed how long it took the pendulum\r\nto lose a number of vibrations on the seconds clock. For this purpose,\r\nhe noted the time when the beat of the clock was heard and,\r\nsimultaneously, the thread moved past the center of the scale. A\r\nhistoric aspect of Bouguer's method was that he employed an \"invariable\"\r\npendulum, that is, the length was maintained the same at the various\r\nstations of observation, a procedure that has been described as having\r\nbeen invented by Bouguer.\r\n\r\nSince T = [pi][sqrt](l/g), it follows that (T_{1})^{2}/(T_{2})^{2} =\r\ng_{2}/g_{1}. Thus, if the absolute value of gravity is known at one\r\nstation, the value at any other station can be determined from the ratio\r\nof the squares of times of swing of an invariable pendulum at the two\r\nstations. From the above equation, if T_{1} is the time of swing at a\r\nstation where the intensity of gravity is g, and T_{2} is the time at a\r\nstation where the intensity is g + [Delta]g, then [Delta]g/g =\r\n(T_{1})^{2}/(T_{2})^{2} - 1.\r\n\r\nBouguer's investigations with his invariable pendulum yielded methods\r\nfor the determination of the internal structure of the earth. On the\r\nPeruvian expedition, he determined the length of the seconds pendulum at\r\nthree stations, including one at Quito, at varying distances above sea\r\nlevel. If values of gravity at stations of different elevation are to be\r\ncompared, they must be reduced to the same level, usually to sea level.\r\nSince gravity decreases with height above sea level in accordance with\r\nthe law of gravitation, a free-air reduction must be applied to values\r\nof gravity determined above the level of the sea. Bouguer originated the\r\nadditional reduction for the increase in gravity on a mountain or\r\nplateau caused by the attraction of the matter in a plate. From the\r\nrelative values of gravity at elevated stations in Peru and at sea\r\nlevel, Bouguer calculated that the mean density of the earth was 4.7\r\ntimes greater than that of the _cordilleras_.[17] For greater accuracy\r\nin the study of the internal structure of the earth, in the 19th century\r\nthe Bouguer plate reduction came to be supplemented by corrections for\r\nirregularities of terrain and by different types of isostatic reduction.\r\n\r\nLa Condamine, who like Bouguer was a member of the Peruvian expedition,\r\nconducted his own pendulum experiments (fig. 4). He experimented in 1735\r\nat Santo Domingo en route to South America,[18] then at various stations\r\nin South America, and again at Paris upon his return to France. His\r\npendulum consisted of a copper ball suspended by a thread of pite. For\r\nexperimentation the length initially was about 12 feet, and the time of\r\nswing 2 seconds, but then the length was reduced to about 3 feet with\r\ntime of swing 1 second. Earlier, when it was believed that gravity was\r\nconstant over the earth, Picard and others had proposed that the length\r\nof the seconds pendulum be chosen as the standard. La Condamine in 1747\r\nrevived the proposal in the form that the length of the seconds pendulum\r\nat the equator be adopted as the standard of length. Subsequently, he\r\ninvestigated the expansion of a toise of iron from the variation in the\r\nperiod of his pendulum. In 1755, he observed the pendulum at Rome with\r\nBoscovich. La Condamine's pendulum was used by other observers and\r\nfinally was lost at sea on an expedition around the world. The knowledge\r\nof the pendulum acquired by the end of the 18th century was summarized\r\nin 1785 in a memoir by Boscovich.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--AN APPARATUS FOR THE PRACTICE MEASUREMENT of\r\nthe length of the pendulum devised on the basis of a series of\r\npreliminary experiments by C. M. de la Condamine who, in the course of\r\nthe French geodetic expedition to Peru in 1735, devoted a 3-month\r\nsojourn on the island of Santo Domingo to pendulum observations by\r\nMairan's Method. In this arrangement, shown here, a vertical rod of\r\nironwood is used both as the scale and as the support for the apparatus,\r\nhaving at its top the brass pendulum support (A) and, below, a\r\nhorizontal mirror (O) which serves to align the apparatus vertically\r\nthrough visual observation of the reflection of the pointer projecting\r\nfrom A. The pendulum, about 37 inches long, consists of a thread of pite\r\n(a humidity-resistant, natural fiber) and a copper ball of about 6\r\nounces. Its exact length is determined by adjusting the micrometer (S)\r\nso that the ball nearly touches the mirror. It will be noted that the\r\nclock pendulum would be obscured by the scale. La Condamine seems to\r\nhave determined the times of coincidence by visual observation of the\r\noccasions on which \"the pendulums swing parallel.\" (Portion of plate 1,\r\n_Memoires publies par la Societe francaise de Physique_, vol. 4.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--THE RESULT of early pendulum experiments was\r\noften expressed in terms of the length of a pendulum which would have a\r\nperiod of one second and was called \"the seconds pendulum.\" In 1792, J.\r\nC. Borda and J. D. Cassini determined the length of the seconds pendulum\r\nat Paris with this apparatus. The pendulum consists of a platinum ball\r\nabout 1-1/2 inches in diameter, suspended by a fine iron wire. The\r\nlength, about 12 feet, was such that its period would be nearly twice as\r\nlong as that of the pendulum of the clock (A). The interval between\r\ncoincidences was determined by observing, through the telescope at the\r\nleft, the times when the two pendulums emerge together from behind the\r\nscreen (M). The exact length of the pendulum was measured by a platinum\r\nscale (not shown) equipped with a vernier and an auxiliary copper scale\r\nfor temperature correction.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the end of the 18th century, the French revolutionary\r\ngovernment established the metric system of weights and measures, the\r\nlength of the seconds pendulum at Paris was considered, but not adopted,\r\nas the unit of length. (Plate 2, _Memoires publies par la Societe\r\nfrancaise de Physique_, vol. 4.)]\r\n\r\nThe practice with the \"simple\" pendulum on the part of Picard, Bouguer,\r\nLa Condamine and others in France culminated in the work of Borda and\r\nCassini in 1792 at the observatory in Paris[20] (fig. 6). The\r\nexperiments were undertaken to determine whether or not the length of\r\nthe seconds pendulum should be adopted as the standard of length by the\r\nnew government of France. The bob consisted of a platinum ball 16-1/6\r\nParis lines in diameter, and 9,911 grains (slightly more than 17 ounces)\r\nin weight. The bob was held to a brass cup covering about one-fifth of\r\nits surface by the interposition of a small quantity of grease. The cup\r\nwith ball was hung by a fine iron wire about 12 Paris feet long. The\r\nupper end of the wire was attached to a cylinder which was part of a\r\nwedge-shaped knife edge, on the upper surface of which was a stem on\r\nwhich a small adjustable weight was held by a screw thread. The knife\r\nedge rested on a steel plate. The weight on the knife-edge apparatus was\r\nadjusted so that the apparatus would vibrate with the same period as the\r\npendulum. Thus, the mass of the suspending apparatus could be neglected\r\nin the theory of motion of the pendulum about the knife edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS in the determination of\r\nthe length of the seconds pendulum at Koenigsberg by a new method were\r\nreported by F. W. Bessel in 1826 and published in 1828. With this\r\napparatus, he obtained two sets of data from the same pendulum, by using\r\ntwo different points of suspension. The pendulum was about 10 feet long.\r\nThe distance between the two points of suspension (_a_ and _b_) was 1\r\ntoise (about six feet). A micrometric balance (_c_) below the bob was\r\nused to determine the increase in length due to the weight of the bob.\r\nHe projected the image of the clock pendulum (not shown) onto the\r\ngravity pendulum by means of a lens, thus placing the clock some\r\ndistance away and eliminating the disturbing effect of its motion.\r\n(Portion of plate 6, _Memoires publies par la Societe francaise de\r\nPhysique_, vol. 4.)]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier suspension from jaws there was uncertainty as to the\r\npoint about which the pendulum oscillated. Borda and Cassini hung their\r\npendulum in front of a seconds clock and determined the time of swing by\r\nthe method of coincidences. The times on the clock were observed when\r\nthe clock gained or lost one complete vibration (two swings) on the\r\npendulum. Suppose that the wire pendulum makes n swings while the clock\r\nmakes 2n + 2. If the clock beats seconds exactly, the time of one\r\ncomplete vibration is 2 seconds, and the time of swing of the wire\r\npendulum is T = (2n + 2)/n = 2(1 + 1/n). An error in the time caused by\r\nuncertainty in determining the coincidence of clock and wire pendulum is\r\nreduced by employing a long interval of observation 2n. The whole\r\napparatus was enclosed in a box, in order to exclude disturbances from\r\ncurrents of air. Corrections were made for buoyancy, for amplitude of\r\nswing and for variations in length of the wire with temperature. The\r\nfinal result was that the length of the seconds pendulum at the\r\nobservatory in Paris was determined to be 440.5593 Paris lines, or\r\n993.53 mm., reduced to sea level 993.85 mm. Some years later the methods\r\nof Borda were used by other French investigators, among whom was Biot\r\nwho used the platinum ball of Borda suspended by a copper wire 60 cm.\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nAnother historic \"simple\" pendulum was the one swung by Bessel (fig. 7)\r\nfor the determination of gravity at Koenigsberg 1825-1827.[21] The\r\npendulum consisted of a ball of brass, copper, or ivory that was\r\nsuspended by a fine wire, the upper end of which was wrapped and\r\nunwrapped on a horizontal cylinder as support. The pendulum was swung\r\nfirst from one point and then from another, exactly a \"toise de\r\nPeru\"[22] higher up, the bob being at the same level in each case (fig.\r\n7). Bessel found the period of vibration of the pendulum by the method\r\nof coincidences; and in order to avoid disturbances from the comparison\r\nclock, it was placed at some distance from the pendulum under\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nBessel's experiments were significant in view of the care with which he\r\ndetermined the corrections. He corrected for the stiffness of the wire\r\nand for the lack of rigidity of connection between the bob and wire. The\r\nnecessity for the latter correction had been pointed out by Laplace, who\r\nshowed that through the circumstance that the pull of the wire is now on\r\none side and now on the other side of the center of gravity, the bob\r\nacquires angular momentum about its center of gravity, which cannot be\r\naccounted for if the line of the wire, and therefore the force that it\r\nexerts, always passed through the center. In addition to a correction\r\nfor buoyancy of the air considered by his predecessors, Bessel also took\r\naccount of the inertia of the air set in motion by the pendulum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--MODE OF SUSPENSION of Bessel's pendulum is\r\nshown here. The iron wire is supported by the thumbscrew and clamp at\r\nthe left, but passes over a pin at the center, which is actually the\r\nupper terminal of the pendulum. Bessel found this \"cylinder of\r\nunrolling\" superior to the clamps and knife edges of earlier pendulums.\r\nThe counterweight at the right is part of a system for supporting the\r\nscale in such a way that it is not elongated by its own weight.\r\n\r\nWith this apparatus, Bessel determined the ratio of the lengths of the\r\ntwo pendulums and their times of vibration. From this the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum was calculated. His method eliminated the need to take\r\ninto account such sources of inaccuracy as flexure of the pendulum wire\r\nand imperfections in the shape of the bob. (Portion of plate 7,\r\n_Memoires publies par la Societe francaise de Physique_, vol. 4.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--FRIEDRICH WILHELM BESSEL (1784-1846), German\r\nmathematician and astronomer. He became the first superintendent of the\r\nPrussian observatory established at Koenigsberg in 1810, and remained\r\nthere during the remainder of his life. So important were his many\r\ncontributions to precise measurement and calculation in astronomy that\r\nhe is often considered the founder of the \"modern\" age in that science.\r\nThis characteristic also shows in his venture into geodesy, 1826-1830,\r\none product of which was the pendulum experiment reported in this\r\narticle.]\r\n\r\nThe latter effect had been discovered by Du Buat in 1786,[23] but his\r\nwork was unknown to Bessel. The length of the seconds pendulum at\r\nKoenigsberg, reduced to sea level, was found by Bessel to be 440.8179\r\nlines. In 1835, Bessel determined the intensity of gravity at a site in\r\nBerlin where observations later were conducted in the Imperial Office of\r\nWeights and Measures by Charles S. Peirce of the U.S. Coast Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKater's Convertible and Invariable Pendulums\r\n\r\n\r\nThe systematic survey of the gravity field of the earth was given a\r\ngreat impetus by the contributions of Capt. Henry Kater, F.R.S. In 1817,\r\nhe designed, constructed, and applied a convertible compound pendulum\r\nfor the absolute determination of gravity at the house of Henry Browne,\r\nF.R.S., in Portland Place, London.[24] Kater's convertible pendulum\r\n(fig. 11) consisted of a brass rod to which were attached a flat\r\ncircular bob of brass and two adjustable weights, the smaller of which\r\nwas adjusted by a screw. The convertibility of the pendulum was\r\nconstituted by the provision of two knife edges turned inwards on\r\nopposite sides of the center of gravity. The pendulum was swung on each\r\nknife edge, and the adjustable weights were moved until the times of\r\nswing were the same about each knife edge. When the times were judged to\r\nbe the same, the distance between the knife edges was inferred to be the\r\nlength of the equivalent simple pendulum, in accordance with Huygens'\r\ntheorem on conjugate points of a compound pendulum. Kater determined the\r\ntime of swing by the method of coincidences (fig. 12). He corrected for\r\nthe buoyancy of the air. The final value of the length of the seconds\r\npendulum at Browne's house in London, reduced to sea level, was\r\ndetermined to be 39.13929 inches.\r\n\r\nThe convertible compound pendulum had been conceived prior to its\r\nrealization by Kater. In 1792, on the occasion of the proposal in Paris\r\nto establish the standard of length as the length of the seconds\r\npendulum, Baron de Prony had proposed the employment of a compound\r\npendulum with three axes of oscillation.[25] In 1800, he proposed the\r\nconvertible compound pendulum with knife edges about which the pendulum\r\ncould complete swings in equal times. De Prony's proposals were not\r\naccepted and his papers remained unpublished until 1889, at which time\r\nthey were discovered by Defforges. The French decision was to experiment\r\nwith the ball pendulum, and the determination of the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum was carried out by Borda and Cassini by methods\r\npreviously described. Bohnenberger in his _Astronomie_ (1811),[26] made\r\nthe proposal to employ a convertible pendulum for the absolute\r\ndetermination of gravity; thus, he has received credit for priority in\r\npublication. Capt. Kater independently conceived of the convertible\r\npendulum and was the first to design, construct, and swing one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--HENRY KATER (1777-1835), English army officer\r\nand physicist. His scientific career began during his military service\r\nin India, where he assisted in the \"great trigonometrical survey.\"\r\nReturned to England because of bad health, and retired in 1814, he\r\npioneered (1818) in the development of the convertible pendulum as an\r\nalternative to the approximation of the \"simple\" pendulum for the\r\nmeasurement of the \"seconds pendulum.\" Kater's convertible pendulum and\r\nthe invariable pendulum introduced by him in 1819 were the basis of\r\nEnglish pendulum work. (_Photo courtesy National Portrait Gallery,\r\nLondon._)]\r\n\r\nAfter his observations with the convertible pendulum, Capt. Kater\r\ndesigned an invariable compound pendulum with a single knife edge but\r\notherwise similar in external form to the convertible pendulum[27] (fig.\r\n13). Thirteen of these Kater invariable pendulums have been reported as\r\nconstructed and swung at stations throughout the world.[28] Kater\r\nhimself swung an invariable pendulum at a station in London and at\r\nvarious other stations in the British Isles. Capt. Edward Sabine,\r\nbetween 1820 and 1825, made voyages and swung Kater invariable pendulums\r\nat stations from the West Indies to Greenland and Spitzbergen.[29] In\r\n1820, Kater swung a Kater invariable pendulum at London and then sent it\r\nto Goldingham, who swung it in 1821 at Madras, India.[30] Also in 1820,\r\nKater supplied an invariable pendulum to Hall, who swung it at London\r\nand then made observations near the equator and in the Southern\r\nHemisphere, and at London again in 1823.[31] The same pendulum, after\r\nits knives were reground, was delivered to Adm. Luetke of Russia, who\r\nobserved gravity with it on a trip around the world between 1826 and\r\n1829.[32]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--THE ATTEMPT TO APPROXIMATE the simple\r\n(theoretical) pendulum in gravity experiments ended in 1817-18 when\r\nHenry Kater invented the compound convertible pendulum, from which the\r\nequivalent simple pendulum could be obtained according to the method of\r\nHuygens (see text, p. 314). Developed in connection with a project to\r\nfix the standard of English measure, Kater's pendulum was called\r\n\"compound\" because it was a solid bar rather than the fine wire or\r\nstring with which earlier experimenters had tried to approximate a\r\n\"weightless\" rod. It was called convertible because it is alternately\r\nswung from the two knife edges (_a_ and _b_) at opposite ends. The\r\nweights (_f_ and _g_) are adjusted so that the period of the pendulum is\r\nthe same from either knife edge. The distance between the two knife\r\nedges is then equal to the length of the equivalent simple pendulum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--THE KATER CONVERTIBLE PENDULUM in use is\r\nplaced before a clock, whose pendulum bob is directly behind the\r\nextended \"tail\" of the Kater pendulum. A white spot is painted on the\r\ncenter of the bob of the clock pendulum. The observing telescope, left,\r\nhas a diaphragm with a vertical slit of such width that its view is just\r\nfilled by the tail of the Kater pendulum when it is at rest. When the\r\ntwo pendulums are swinging, the white spot on the clock pendulum can be\r\nseen on each swing except that in which the two pendulums are in\r\ncoincidence; thus, the coincidences are determined.

The\r\nvalue of gravity obtained, directly or indirectly, in terms of the\r\nsimple pendulum, is called \"absolute.\" Once absolute values of gravity\r\nwere established at a number of stations, it became possible to use the\r\nmuch simpler \"relative\" method for the measurement of gravity at new\r\nstations. Because it has only one knife edge, and does not involve the\r\nadjustments of the convertible pendulum, this one is called\r\n\"invariable.\" In use, it is first swung at a station where the absolute\r\nvalue of gravity has been established, and this period is then compared\r\nwith its period at one or more new stations. Kater developed an\r\ninvariable pendulum in 1819, which was used in England and in Madras,\r\nIndia, in 1821.]\r\n\r\nWhile the British were engaged in swinging the Kater invariable\r\npendulums to determine relative values of the length of the seconds\r\npendulum, or of gravity, the French also sent out expeditions. Capt. de\r\nFreycinet made initial observations at Paris with three invariable brass\r\npendulums and one wooden one, and then carried out observations at Rio\r\nde Janeiro, Cape of Good Hope, Ile de France, Rawak (near New Guinea),\r\nGuam, Maui, and various other places.[33] A similar expedition was\r\nconducted in 1822-1825 by Captain Duperry.[34]\r\n\r\nDuring the years from 1827 to 1840, various types of pendulum were\r\nconstructed and swung by Francis Baily, a member of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society, who reported in 1832 on experiments in which no\r\nless than 41 different pendulums were swung in vacuo, and their\r\ncharacteristics determined.[35] In 1836, Baily undertook to advise the\r\nAmerican Lt. Charles Wilkes, who was to head the United States\r\nExploring Expedition of 1838-1842, on the procurement of pendulums for\r\nthis voyage. Wilkes ordered from the London instrument maker, Thomas\r\nJones, two unusual pendulums, which Wilkes described as \"those\r\nconsidered the best form by Mr. Baily for traveling pendulums,\" and\r\nwhich Baily, himself, described as \"precisely the same as the two\r\ninvariable pendulums belonging to this [Royal Astronomical] Society,\"\r\nexcept for the location of the knife edges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--VACUUM CHAMBER FOR USE with the Kater\r\npendulum. Of a number of extraneous effects which tend to disturb the\r\naccuracy of pendulum observations the most important is air resistance.\r\nExperiments reported by the Greenwich (England) observatory in 1829 led\r\nto the development of a vacuum chamber within which the pendulum was\r\nswung.]\r\n\r\nThe unusual feature of these pendulums was in their symmetry of mass as\r\nwell as of form. They were made of bars, of iron in one case, and of\r\nbrass in the other, and each had two knife edges at opposite ends\r\nequidistant from the center. Thus, although they resembled reversible\r\npendulums, their symmetry of mass prevented their use as such, and they\r\nwere rather equivalent to four separate invariable pendulums.[36]\r\n\r\nWilkes was taught the use of the pendulum by Baily, and conducted\r\nexperiments at Baily's house, where the latter had carried out the work\r\nreported on in 1832. The subsequent experiments made on the U.S.\r\nExploring Expedition were under the charge of Wilkes, himself, who made\r\nobservations on 11 separate occasions, beginning with that in London\r\n(1836) and followed by others in New York, Washington, D.C., Rio de\r\nJaneiro, Sydney, Honolulu, \"Pendulum Peak\" (Mauna Loa), Mount Kanoha,\r\nNesqually (Oregon Territory), and, finally, two more times in\r\nWashington, D.C. (1841 and 1845).\r\n\r\nWilkes' results were communicated to Baily, who appears to have found\r\nthe work defective because of insufficient attention to the maintenance\r\nof temperature constancy and to certain alterations made to the\r\npendulums.[37] The results were also to have been included in the\r\npublications of the Expedition, but were part of the unpublished 24th\r\nvolume. Fortunately they still exist, in what appears to be a printer's\r\nproof.[38]\r\n\r\nThe Kater invariable pendulums were used to investigate the internal\r\nconstitution of the earth. Airy sought to determine the density of the\r\nearth by observing the times of swing of pendulums at the top and bottom\r\nof a mine. The first experiments were made in 1826 at the Dolcoath\r\ncopper mine in Cornwall, and failed when the pendulum fell to the\r\nbottom. In 1854, the experiments were again undertaken in the Harton\r\ncoalpit, near Sunderland.[39] Gravity at the surface was greater than\r\nbelow, because of the attraction of a shell equal to the depth of the\r\npit. From the density of the shell as determined from specimens of rock,\r\nAiry found the density of the earth to be 6-1/2 times greater than that\r\nof water. T. C. Mendenhall, in 1880, used a Kater convertible pendulum\r\nin an invariable manner to compare values of gravity on Fujiyama and at\r\nTokyo, Japan.[40] He used a \"simple\" pendulum of the Borda type to\r\ndetermine the absolute value of gravity at Tokyo. From the values of\r\ngravity on the mountain and at Tokyo, and an estimate of the volume of\r\nthe mountain, he estimated the mean density of the earth as 5.77 times\r\ngreater than that of water.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, Maj. J. Herschel, R.E., stated:\r\n\r\n    The years from 1840 to 1865 are a complete blank, if we except\r\n    Airy's relative density experiments in 1854. This pause was\r\n    broken simultaneously in three different ways. Two pendulums of\r\n    the Kater pattern were sent to India; two after Bessel's design\r\n    were set to work in Russia; and at Geneva, Plantamour's zealous\r\n    experiments with a pendulum of the same kind mark the\r\n    commencement of an era of renewed activity on the European\r\n    continent.[41]\r\n\r\nWith the statement that Kater invariable pendulums nos. 4 and 6 (1821)\r\nwere used in India between 1865 and 1873, we now consider the other\r\nevents mentioned by Herschel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--ONE OF FRANCIS BAILY'S PENDULUMS (62-1/2\r\ninches long), shown on the left, is now in the possession of the Science\r\nMuseum, London, and, right, two views of a similar pendulum (37-5/8\r\ninches long) made in the late 19th century by Edward Kuebel, Washington,\r\nD.C., which is no. 316,876 in the collection of the U.S. National\r\nMuseum. Among a large number of pendulums tried by Baily in London\r\n(1827-1840), was one which resembles the reversible pendulum\r\nsuperficially, but which is actually an invariable pendulum having knife\r\nedges at both ends. The purpose was apparently economy, since it is\r\nequivalent to two separate invariable pendulums. This is the type of\r\npendulum used on the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842. It is not\r\nknown what use was made of the Kuebel pendulum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepsold-Bessel Reversible Pendulum\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have noted, Bessel made determinations of gravity with a ball\r\n(\"simple\") pendulum in the period 1825-1827 and in 1835 at Koenigsberg\r\nand Berlin, respectively. In the memoir on his observations at\r\nKoenigsberg, he set forth the theory of the symmetrical compound pendulum\r\nwith interchangeable knife edges.[42] Bessel demonstrated theoretically\r\nthat if the pendulum were symmetrical with respect to its geometrical\r\ncenter, if the times of swing about each axis were the same, the effects\r\nof buoyancy and of air set in motion would be eliminated. Laplace had\r\nalready shown that the knife edge must be regarded as a cylinder and not\r\nas a mere line of support. Bessel then showed that if the knife edges\r\nwere equal cylinders, their effects were eliminated by inverting the\r\npendulum; and if the knife edges were not equal cylinders, the\r\ndifference in their effects was canceled by interchanging the knives and\r\nagain determining the times of swing in the so-called erect and inverted\r\npositions. Bessel further showed that it is unnecessary to make the\r\ntimes of swing exactly equal for the two knife edges.\r\n\r\nThe simplified discussion for infinitely small oscillations in a vacuum\r\nis as follows: If T_{1} and T_{2} are the times of swing about the knife\r\nedges, and if h_{1} and h_{2} are distances of the knife edges from the\r\ncenter of gravity, and if k is the radius of gyration about an axis\r\nthrough the center of gravity, then from the equation of motion of a\r\nrigid body oscillating about a fixed axis under gravity\r\n\r\n  (T_{1})^{2} = [pi]^{2}(k^{2} + (h_{1})^{2})/gh_{1},\r\n\r\n  (T_{2})^{2} = [pi]^{2}(k^{2} + (h_{2})^{2})/gh_{2}.\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n  (h_{1}(T_{1})^{2} - h_{2}(T_{2})^{2})/(h_{1} - h_{2})\r\n\r\n  = ([pi]^{2}/g)(h_{1} + h_{2})\r\n\r\n  = [tau]^{2}.\r\n\r\n[tau] is then the time of swing of a simple pendulum of length h_{1} +\r\nh_{2}. If the difference T_{1} - T_{2} is sufficiently small,\r\n\r\n  [tau] = (h_{1}T_{1} - h_{2}T_{2})/(h_{1} - h_{2}).\r\n\r\nPrior to its publication by Bessel in 1828, the formula for the time of\r\nswing of a simple pendulum of length h_{1} + h_{2} in terms of T_{1},\r\nT_{2} had been given by C. F. Gauss in a letter to H. C. Schumacher\r\ndated November 28, 1824.[43]\r\n\r\nThe symmetrical compound pendulum with interchangeable knives, for which\r\nBessel gave a posthumously published design and specifications,[44] has\r\nbeen called a reversible pendulum; it may thereby be distinguished from\r\nKater's unsymmetrical convertible pendulum. In 1861, the Swiss Geodetic\r\nCommission was formed, and in one of its first sessions in 1862 it was\r\ndecided to add determinations of gravity to the operations connected\r\nwith the measurement--at different points in Switzerland--of the arc of\r\nthe meridian traversing central Europe.[45] It was decided further to\r\nemploy a reversible pendulum of Bessel's design and to have it\r\nconstructed by the firm of A. Repsold and Sons, Hamburg. It was also\r\ndecided to make the first observations with the pendulum in Geneva;\r\naccordingly, the Repsold-Bessel pendulum (fig. 16) was sent to Prof. E.\r\nPlantamour, director of the observatory at Geneva, in the autumn of\r\n1864.[46]\r\n\r\nThe Swiss reversible pendulum was about 560 mm. in length (distance\r\nbetween the knife edges) and the time of swing was approximately 3/4\r\nsecond. At the extremities of the stem of the pendulum were movable\r\ncylindrical disks, one of which was solid and heavy, the other hollow\r\nand light. It was intended by the mechanicians that equality of times of\r\noscillation about the knife edges would be achieved by adjusting the\r\nposition of a movable disk. The pendulum was hung by a knife edge on a\r\nplate supported by a tripod and having an attachment from which a\r\nmeasuring rod could be suspended so that the distance between the knife\r\nedges could be measured by a comparator. Plantamour found it\r\nimpracticable to adjust a disk until the times of swing about each knife\r\nedge were equal. His colleague, Charles Cellerier,[47] then showed that\r\nif (T_{1} - T_{2})/T_{1} is sufficiently small so that one can neglect\r\nits square, one can determine the length of the seconds pendulum from\r\nthe times of swing about the knife edges by a theory which uses the\r\ndistances of the center of gravity from the respective knife edges.\r\nThus, a role for the position of the center of gravity in the theory of\r\nthe reversible pendulum, which had been set forth earlier by Bessel, was\r\ndiscovered independently by Cellerier for the Swiss observers of\r\npendulums.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Plantamour published an extensive memoir \"Experiences faites a\r\nGeneve avec le pendule a reversion.\" Another memoir, published in 1872,\r\npresented further results of determinations of gravity in Switzerland.\r\nPlantamour was the first scientist in western Europe to use a\r\nRepsold-Bessel reversible pendulum and to work out methods for its\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences acquired two Repsold-Bessel\r\npendulums, and observations with them were begun in 1864 by Prof.\r\nSawitsch, University of St. Petersburg, and others.[48] In 1869, the\r\nRussian pendulums were loaned to the India Survey in order to enable\r\nmembers of the Survey to supplement observations with the Kater\r\ninvariable pendulums nos. 4 and 6 (1821). During the transport of the\r\nRussian apparatus to India, the knives became rusted and the apparatus\r\nhad to be reconditioned. Capt. Heaviside of the India Survey observed\r\nwith both pendulums at Kew Observatory, near London, in the spring of\r\n1874, after which the Russian pendulums were sent to Pulkowa (Russia)\r\nand were used for observations there and in the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum for the\r\ndetermination of gravity was accompanied by the creation of the first\r\ninternational scientific association, one for geodesy. In 1861, Lt. Gen.\r\nJ. J. Baeyer, director of the Prussian Geodetic Survey, sent a\r\nmemorandum to the Prussian minister of war in which he proposed that the\r\nindependent geodetic surveys of the states of central Europe be\r\ncoordinated by the creation of an international organization.[49] In\r\n1862, invitations were sent to the various German states and to other\r\nstates of central Europe. The first General Conference of the\r\nassociation, initially called _Die Mittel-Europaeische Gradmessung_, also\r\n_L'Association Geodesique Internationale_, was held from the 15th to\r\nthe 22d of October 1864 in Berlin.[50] The Conference decided upon\r\nquestions of organization: a general conference was to be held\r\nordinarily every three years; a permanent commission initially\r\nconsisting of seven members was to be the scientific organ of the\r\nassociation and to meet annually; a central bureau was to be established\r\nfor the reception, publication, and distribution of reports from the\r\nmember states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--FROM A DESIGN LEFT BY BESSEL, this portable\r\napparatus was developed in 1862 by the firm of Repsold in Hamburg, whose\r\nfounder had assisted Bessel in the construction of his pendulum\r\napparatus of 1826. The pendulum is convertible, but differs from Kater's\r\nin being geometrically symmetrical and, for this reason, Repsold's is\r\nusually called \"reversible.\" Just to the right of the pendulum is a\r\nstandard scale. To the left is a \"vertical comparator\" designed by\r\nRepsold to measure the distance between the knife edges of the pendulum.\r\nTo make this measurement, two micrometer microscopes which project\r\nhorizontally through the comparator are alternately focused on the knife\r\nedges and on the standard scale.]\r\n\r\nUnder the topic \"Astronomical Questions,\" the General Conference of 1864\r\nresolved that there should be determinations of the intensity of gravity\r\nat the greatest possible number of points of the geodetic network, and\r\nrecommended the reversible pendulum as the instrument of\r\nobservation.[51] At the second General Conference, in Berlin in 1867, on\r\nthe basis of favorable reports by Dr. Hirsch, director of the\r\nobservatory at Neuchatel, of Swiss practice with the Repsold-Bessel\r\nreversible pendulum, this instrument was specifically recommended for\r\ndeterminations of gravity.[52] The title of the association was changed\r\nto _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_; in 1886, it became _Die Internationale\r\nErdmessung_, under which title it continued until World War I.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1866, the Central Bureau of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_\r\nwas opened in Berlin under the presidency of Baeyer, and in 1868 there\r\nwas founded at Berlin, also under his presidency, the Royal Prussian\r\nGeodetic Institute, which obtained regular budgetary status on January\r\n1, 1870. A reversible pendulum for the Institute was ordered from A.\r\nRepsold and Sons, and it was delivered in the spring of 1869. The\r\nPrussian instrument was symmetrical geometrically, as specified by\r\nBessel, but different in form from the Swiss and Russian pendulums. The\r\ndistance between the knife edges was 1 meter, and the time of swing\r\napproximately 1 second. The Prussian Repsold-Bessel pendulum was swung\r\nat Leipzig and other stations in central Europe during the years\r\n1869-1870 by Dr. Albrecht under the direction of Dr. Bruhns, director of\r\nthe observatory at Leipzig and chief of the astronomical section of the\r\nGeodetic Institute. The results of these first observations appeared in\r\na publication of the Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute in 1871.[53]\r\n\r\nResults of observations with the Russian Repsold-Bessel pendulums were\r\npublished by the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1872, Prof. Sawitsch\r\nreported the work for western Europeans in \"Les variations de la\r\npesanteur dans les provinces occidentales de l'Empire russe.\"[48] In\r\nNovember 1873, the Austrian Geodetic Commission received a\r\nRepsold-Bessel reversible pendulum and on September 24, 1874, Prof.\r\nTheodor von Oppolzer reported on observations at Vienna and other\r\nstations to the Fourth General Conference of _Die Europaeische\r\nGradmessung_ in Dresden.[54] At the fourth session of the Conference, on\r\nSeptember 28, 1874, a Special Commission, consisting of Baeyer, as\r\nchairman, and Bruhns, Hirsch, von Oppolzer, Peters, and Albrecht, was\r\nappointed to consider (under Topic 3 of the program): \"Observations for\r\nthe determination of the intensity of gravity,\" the question, \"Which\r\nPendulum-apparatuses are preferable for the determination of many\r\npoints?\"\r\n\r\nAfter the adoption of the Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum for gravity\r\ndeterminations in Europe, work in the field was begun by the U.S. Coast\r\nSurvey under the superintendency of Prof. Benjamin Peirce. There is\r\nmention in reports of observations with pendulums prior to Peirce's\r\ndirection to his son Charles on November 30, 1872, \"to take charge of\r\nthe Pendulum Experiments of the Coast Survey and to direct and inspect\r\nall parties engaged in such experiments and as often as circumstances\r\nwill permit, to take the field with a party....\"[55] Systematic and\r\nimportant gravity work by the Survey was begun by Charles Sanders\r\nPeirce. Upon receiving notice of his appointment, the latter promptly\r\nordered from the Repsolds a pendulum similar to the Prussian instrument.\r\nSince the firm of mechanicians was engaged in making instruments for\r\nobservations of the transit of Venus in 1874, the pendulum for the\r\nCoast Survey could not be constructed immediately. Meanwhile, during the\r\nyears 1873-1874, Charles Peirce conducted a party which made\r\nobservations of gravity in the Hoosac Tunnel near North Adams, and at\r\nNorthampton and Cambridge, Massachusetts. The pendulums used were\r\nnonreversible, invariable pendulums with conical bobs. Among them was a\r\nsilver pendulum, but similar pendulums of brass were used also.[56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--REPSOLD-BESSEL REVERSIBLE PENDULUM apparatus\r\nas made in 1875, and used in the gravity work of the U.S. Coast and\r\nGeodetic Survey. Continental geodesists continued to favor the general\r\nuse of convertible pendulums and absolute determinations of gravity,\r\nwhile their English colleagues had turned to invariable pendulums and\r\nrelative determinations, except for base stations. Perhaps the first\r\nimportant American contribution to gravity work was C. S. Peirce's\r\ndemonstration of the error inherent in the Repsold apparatus through\r\nflexure of the stand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--CHARLES SANDERS PEIRCE (1839-1914), son of\r\nBenjamin Peirce, Perkins Professor of Astronomy and Mathematics at\r\nHarvard College. C. S. Peirce graduated from Harvard in 1859. From 1873\r\nto 1891, as an assistant at the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, he\r\naccomplished the important gravimetric work described in this article.\r\nPeirce was also interested in many other fields, but above all in the\r\nlogic, philosophy, and history of science, in which he wrote\r\nextensively. His greatest fame is in philosophy, where he is regarded as\r\nthe founder of pragmatism.]\r\n\r\nIn 1874, Charles Peirce expressed the desire to be sent to Europe for at\r\nleast a year, beginning about March 1, 1875, \"to learn the use of the\r\nnew convertible pendulum and to compare it with those of the European\r\nmeasure of a Degree and the Swiss and to compare\" his \"invariable\r\npendulums in the manner which has been used by swinging them in London\r\nand Paris.\"[57]\r\n\r\nCharles S. Peirce, assistant, U.S. Coast Survey, sailed for Europe on\r\nApril 3, 1875, on his mission to obtain the Repsold-Bessel reversible\r\npendulum ordered for the Survey and to learn the methods of using it for\r\nthe determination of gravity. In England, he conferred with Maxwell,\r\nStokes, and Airy concerning the theory and practice of research with\r\npendulums. In May, he continued on to Hamburg and obtained delivery from\r\nthe Repsolds of the pendulum for the Coast Survey (fig. 17). Peirce then\r\nwent to Berlin and conferred with Gen. Baeyer, who expressed doubts of\r\nthe stability of the Repsold stand for the pendulum. Peirce next went to\r\nGeneva, where, under arrangements with Prof. Plantamour, he swung the\r\nnewly acquired pendulum at the observatory.[58]\r\n\r\nIn view of Baeyer's expressed doubts of the rigidity of the Repsold\r\nstand, Peirce performed experiments to measure the flexure of the stand\r\ncaused by the oscillations of the pendulum. His method was to set up a\r\nmicrometer in front of the pendulum stand and, with a microscope, to\r\nmeasure the displacement caused by a weight passing over a pulley, the\r\nfriction of which had been determined. Peirce calculated the correction\r\nto be applied to the length of the seconds pendulum--on account of the\r\nswaying of the stand during the swings of the pendulum--to amount to\r\nover 0.2 mm. Although Peirce's measurements of flexure in Geneva were\r\nnot as precise as his later measurements, he believed that failure to\r\ncorrect for flexure of the stand in determinations previously made with\r\nRepsold pendulums was responsible for appreciable errors in reported\r\nvalues of the length of the seconds pendulum.\r\n\r\nThe Permanent Commission of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_ met in Paris,\r\nSeptember 20-29, 1875. In conjunction with this meeting, there was held\r\non September 21 a meeting of the Special Commission on the Pendulum. The\r\nbasis of the discussion by the Special Commission was provided by\r\nreports which had been submitted in response to a circular sent out by\r\nthe Central Bureau to the members on February 26, 1874.[59]\r\n\r\nGen. Baeyer stated that the distance of 1 meter between the knife edges\r\nof the Prussian Repsold-Bessel pendulum made it unwieldy and unsuited\r\nfor transport. He declared that the instability of the stand also was a\r\nsource of error. Accordingly, Gen. Baeyer expressed the opinion that\r\nabsolute determinations of gravity should be made at a control station\r\nby a reversible pendulum hung on a permanent, and therefore stable\r\nstand, and he said that relative values of gravity with respect to the\r\ncontrol station should be obtained in the field by means of a Bouguer\r\ninvariable pendulum. Dr. Bruhns and Dr. Peters agreed with Gen. Baeyer;\r\nhowever, the Swiss investigators, Prof. Plantamour and Dr. Hirsch\r\nreported in defense of the reversible pendulum as a field instrument, as\r\ndid Prof. von Oppolzer of Vienna. The circumstance that an invariable\r\npendulum is subject to changes in length was offered as an argument in\r\nfavor of the reversible pendulum as a field instrument.\r\n\r\nPeirce was present during these discussions by the members of the\r\nSpecial Commission, and he reported that his experiments at Geneva\r\ndemonstrated that the oscillations of the pendulum called forth a\r\nflexure of the support which hitherto had been neglected. The observers\r\nwho used the Swiss and Austrian Repsold pendulums contended, in\r\nopposition to Peirce, that the Repsold stand was stable.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of these discussions was that the Special Commission\r\nreported to the Permanent Commission that the Repsold-Bessel reversible\r\npendulum, except for some small changes, satisfied all requirements for\r\nthe determination of gravity. The Special Commission proposed that the\r\nRepsold pendulums of the several states be swung at the Prussian\r\nEichungsamt in Berlin where, as Peirce pointed out, Bessel had made his\r\ndetermination of the intensity of gravity with a ball pendulum in 1835.\r\nPeirce was encouraged to swing the Coast Survey reversible pendulum at\r\nthe stations in France, England, and Germany where Borda and Cassini,\r\nKater, and Bessel, respectively, had made historic determinations. The\r\nPermanent Commission, in whose sessions Peirce also participated, by\r\nresolutions adopted the report of the Special Commission on the\r\nPendulum.[60]\r\n\r\nDuring the months of January and February 1876, Peirce conducted\r\nobservations in the Grande Salle du Meridien at the observatory in Paris\r\nwhere Borda, Biot, and Capt. Edward Sabine had swung pendulums early in\r\nthe 19th century. He conducted observations in Berlin from April to June\r\n1876 and, by experiment, determined the correction for flexure to be\r\napplied to the value of gravity previously obtained with the Prussian\r\ninstrument. Subsequent observations were made at Kew. After his return\r\nto the United States on August 26, 1876, Peirce conducted experiments at\r\nthe Stevens Institute in Hoboken, New Jersey, where he made careful\r\nmeasurements of the flexure of the stand by statical and dynamical\r\nmethods. In Geneva, he had secured the construction of a vacuum chamber\r\nin which the pendulum could be swung on a support which he called the\r\nGeneva support. At the Stevens Institute, Peirce swung the\r\nRepsold-Bessel pendulum on the Geneva support and determined the effect\r\nof different pressures and temperatures on the period of oscillation of\r\nthe pendulum. These experiments continued into 1878.[61]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Permanent Commission met October 5-10, 1876, in Brussels\r\nand continued the discussion of the pendulum.[62] Gen. Baeyer reported\r\non Peirce's experiments in Berlin to determine the flexure of the stand.\r\nThe difference of 0.18 mm. in the lengths of the seconds pendulum as\r\ndetermined by Bessel and as determined by the Repsold instrument agreed\r\nwith Peirce's estimate of error caused by neglect of flexure of the\r\nRepsold stand. Dr. Hirsch, speaking for the Swiss survey, and Prof. von\r\nOppolzer, speaking for the Austrian survey, contended, however, that\r\ntheir stands possessed sufficient stability and that the results found\r\nby Peirce applied only to the stands and bases investigated by him. The\r\nPermanent Commission proposed further study of the pendulum.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth General Conference of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_ was held\r\nfrom September 27 to October 2, 1877, in Stuttgart.[63] Peirce had\r\ninstructions from Supt. Patterson of the U.S. Coast Survey to attend\r\nthis conference, and on arrival presented a letter of introduction from\r\nPatterson requesting that he, Peirce, be permitted to participate in the\r\nsessions. Upon invitation from Prof. Plantamour, as approved by Gen.\r\nIbanez, president of the Permanent Commission, Peirce had sent on July\r\n13, 1877, from New York, the manuscript of a memoir titled \"De\r\nl'Influence de la flexibilite du trepied sur l'oscillation du pendule a\r\nreversion.\" This memoir and others by Cellerier and Plantamour\r\nconfirming Peirce's work were published as appendices to the proceedings\r\nof the conference. As appendices to Peirce's contribution were published\r\nalso two notes by Prof. von Oppolzer. At the second session on September\r\n29, 1877, when Plantamour reported that the work of Hirsch and himself\r\nhad confirmed experimentally the independent theoretical work of\r\nCellerier and the theoretical and experimental work of Peirce on\r\nflexure, Peirce described his Hoboken experiments.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussions at Stuttgart on the flexure of the Repsold stand,\r\nHerve Faye, president of the Bureau of Longitudes, Paris, suggested that\r\nthe swaying of the stand during oscillations of the pendulum could be\r\novercome by the suspension from one support of two similar pendulums\r\nwhich oscillated with equal amplitudes and in opposite phases. This\r\nproposal was criticized by Dr. Hirsch, who declared that exact\r\nobservation of passages of a \"double pendulum\" would be difficult and\r\nthat two pendulums swinging so close together would interfere with each\r\nother. The proposal of the double pendulum came up again at the meeting\r\nof the Permanent Commission at Geneva in 1879.[64] On February 17, 1879,\r\nPeirce had completed a paper \"On a Method of Swinging Pendulums for the\r\nDetermination of Gravity, Proposed by M. Faye.\" In this paper, Peirce\r\npresented the results of an analytical mechanical investigation of\r\nFaye's proposal. Peirce set up the differential equations, found the\r\nsolutions, interpreted them physically, and arrived at the conclusion\r\n\"that the suggestion of M. Faye ... is as sound as it is brilliant and\r\noffers some peculiar advantages over the existing method of swinging\r\npendulums.\"\r\n\r\nIn a report to Supt. Patterson, dated July 1879, Peirce stated: \"I think\r\nit is important before making a new pendulum apparatus to experiment\r\nwith Faye's proposed method.\"[65] He wrote further: \"The method proves\r\nto be perfectly sound in theory, and as it would greatly facilitate the\r\nwork it is probably destined eventually to prevail. We must\r\nunfortunately leave to other surveys the merit of practically testing\r\nand introducing the new method, as our appropriations are insufficient\r\nfor us to maintain the leading position in this matter, which we\r\notherwise might take.\" Copies of the published version of Peirce's\r\nremarks were sent to Europe. At a meeting of the Academy of Sciences in\r\nParis on September 1, 1879, Faye presented a report on Peirce's\r\nfindings.[66] The Permanent Commission met September 16-20, 1879, in\r\nGeneva. At the third session on September 19, by action of Gen. Baeyer,\r\ncopies of Peirce's paper on Faye's proposed method of swinging pendulums\r\nwere distributed. Dr. Hirsch again commented adversely on the proposal,\r\nbut moved that the question be investigated and reported on at the\r\ncoming General Conference. The Permanent Commission accepted the\r\nproposal of Dr. Hirsch, and Prof. Plantamour was named to report on the\r\nmatter at the General Conference. At Plantamour's request, Charles\r\nCellerier was appointed to join him, since the problem essentially was a\r\ntheoretical one.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth General Conference of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_ met\r\nSeptember 13-16, 1880, in Munich.[67] Topic III, part 7 of the program\r\nwas entitled \"On Determinations of Gravity through pendulum\r\nobservations. Which construction of a pendulum apparatus corresponds\r\ncompletely to all requirements of science? Special report on the\r\npendulum.\"\r\n\r\nThe conference received a memoir by Cellerier[68] on the theory of the\r\ndouble pendulum and a report by Plantamour and Cellerier.[69]\r\nCellerier's mathematical analysis began with the equations of Peirce and\r\nused the latter's notation as far as possible. His general discussion\r\nincluded the results of Peirce, but he stated that the difficulties to\r\nbe overcome did not justify the employment of the \"double pendulum.\" He\r\npresented an alternative method of correcting for flexure based upon a\r\ntheory by which the flexure caused by the oscillation of a given\r\nreversible pendulum could be determined from the behavior of an\r\nauxiliary pendulum of the same length but of different weight. This\r\nmethod of correcting for flexure was recommended to the General\r\nConference by Plantamour and Cellerier in their joint report. At the\r\nfourth session of the conference on September 16, 1880, the problem of\r\nthe pendulum was discussed and, in consequence, a commission consisting\r\nof Faye, Helmholtz, Plantamour (replaced in 1882 by Hirsch), and von\r\nOppolzer was appointed to study apparatus suitable for relative\r\ndeterminations of gravity.\r\n\r\nThe Permanent Commission met September 11-15, 1882, at The Hague,[70]\r\nand at its last session appointed Prof. von Oppolzer to report to the\r\nSeventh General Conference on different forms of apparatus for the\r\ndetermination of gravity. The Seventh Conference met October 15-24,\r\n1883, in Rome,[71] and, at its eighth session, on October 22, received a\r\ncomprehensive, critical review from Prof. von Oppolzer entitled \"Ueber\r\ndie Bestimmung der Schwere mit Hilfe verschiedener Apparate.\"[72] Von\r\nOppolzer especially expounded the advantages of the Bessel reversible\r\npendulum, which compensated for air effects by symmetry of form if the\r\ntimes of swing for both positions were maintained between the same\r\namplitudes, and compensated for irregular knife edges by making them\r\ninterchangeable. Prof. von Oppolzer reviewed the problem of flexure of\r\nthe Repsold stand and stated that a solution in the right direction\r\nwas the proposal--made by Faye and theoretically pursued by Peirce--to\r\nswing two pendulums from the same stand with equal amplitudes and in\r\nopposite phases, but that the proposal was not practicable. He concluded\r\nthat for absolute determinations of gravity, the Bessel reversible\r\npendulum was highly appropriate if one swung two exemplars of different\r\nweight from the same stand for the elimination of flexure. Prof. von\r\nOppolzer's important report recognized that absolute determinations were\r\nless accurate than relative ones, and should be conducted only at\r\nspecial places.\r\n\r\nThe discussions initiated by Peirce's demonstration of the flexure of\r\nthe Repsold stand resulted, finally, in the abandonment of the plan to\r\nmake absolute determinations of gravity at all stations with the\r\nreversible pendulum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--THREE PENDULUMS USED IN EARLY WORK at the\r\nU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Shown on the left is the Peirce\r\ninvariable; center, the Peirce reversible; and, right, the Repsold\r\nreversible. Peirce designed the cylindrical pendulum in 1881-1882 to\r\nstudy the effect of air resistance according to the theory of G. G.\r\nStokes on the motion of a pendulum in a viscous field. Three examples of\r\nthe Peirce pendulums are in the U.S. National Museum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeirce and Defforges Invariable, Reversible Pendulums\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum was designed and initially used\r\nto make absolute determinations of gravity not only at initial stations\r\nsuch as Kew, the observatory in Paris, and the Smithsonian Institution\r\nin Washington, D.C., but also at stations in the field. An invariable\r\npendulum with a single knife edge, however, is adequate for relative\r\ndeterminations. As we have seen, such invariable pendulums had been used\r\nby Bouguer and Kater, and after the experiences with the Repsold\r\napparatus had been recommended again by Baeyer for relative\r\ndeterminations. But an invariable pendulum is subject to uncontrollable\r\nchanges of length. Peirce proposed to detect such changes in an\r\ninvariable pendulum in the field by combining the invariable and\r\nreversible principles. He explained his proposal to Faye in a letter\r\ndated July 23, 1880, and he presented it on September 16, 1880, at the\r\nfourth session of the sixth General Conference of _Die Europaeische\r\nGradmessung_, in Munich.[73]\r\n\r\nAs recorded in the Proceedings of the Conference, Peirce wrote:\r\n\r\n    But I obviate it in making my pendulum both invariable and\r\n    reversible. Every alteration of the pendulum will be revealed\r\n    immediately by the change in the difference of the two periods\r\n    of oscillation in the two positions. Once discovered, it will be\r\n    taken account of by means of new measures of the distance\r\n    between the two supports.\r\n\r\nPeirce added that it seemed to him that if the reversible pendulum\r\nperhaps is not the best instrument to determine absolute gravity, it is,\r\non condition that it be truly invariable, the best to determine relative\r\ngravity. Peirce further stated that he would wish that the pendulum be\r\nformed of a tube of drawn brass with heavy plugs of brass equally drawn.\r\nThe cylinder would be terminated by two hemispheres; the knives would be\r\nattached to tongues fixed near the ends of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1881 and 1882, four invariable, reversible pendulums\r\nwere made after the design of Peirce at the office of the U.S. Coast and\r\nGeodetic Survey in Washington, D.C. The report of the superintendent for\r\nthe year 1880-1881 states:\r\n\r\n    A new pattern of the reversible pendulum has been invented,\r\n    having its surface as nearly as convenient in the form of an\r\n    elongated ellipsoid. Three of these instruments have been\r\n    constructed, two having a distance of one meter between the\r\n    knife edges and the third a distance of one yard. It is proposed\r\n    to swing one of the meter pendulums at a temperature near 32 deg.\r\n    F. at the same time that the yard is swung at 60 deg. F., in order\r\n    to determine anew the relation between the yard and the meter.[74]\r\n\r\nThe report for 1881-1882 mentions four of these Peirce pendulums.\r\n\r\nA description of the Peirce invariable, reversible pendulums was given\r\nby Assistant E. D. Preston in \"Determinations of Gravity and the\r\nMagnetic Elements in Connection with the United States Scientific\r\nExpedition to the West Coast of Africa, 1889-90.\"[75] The invariable,\r\nreversible pendulum, Peirce no. 4, now preserved in the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution's Museum of History and Technology (fig. 34), may be taken\r\nas typical of the meter pendulums: In the same memoir, Preston gives the\r\ndiameter of the tube as 63.7 mm., thickness of tube 1.5 mm., weight\r\n10.680 kilograms, and distance between the knives 1.000 meter.\r\n\r\nThe combination of invariability and reversibility in the Peirce\r\npendulums was an innovation for relative determinations. Indeed, the\r\ncombination was criticized by Maj. J. Herschel, R.E., of the Indian\r\nSurvey, at a conference on gravity held in Washington in May 1882 on the\r\noccasion of his visit to the United States for the purpose of\r\nconnecting English and American stations by relative determinations with\r\nthree Kater invariable pendulums. These three pendulums have been\r\ndesignated as nos. 4, 6 (1821), and 11.[76]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--SUPPORT FOR THE PEIRCE PENDULUM, 1889. Much\r\nof the work of C. S. Peirce was concerned with the determination of the\r\nerror introduced into observations made with the portable apparatus by\r\nthe vibration of the stand with the pendulum. He showed that the popular\r\nBessel-Repsold apparatus was subject to such an error. His own pendulums\r\nwere swung from a simple but rugged wooden frame to which a hardened\r\nsteel bearing was fixed.]\r\n\r\nAnother novel characteristic of the Peirce pendulums was the mainly\r\ncylindrical form. Prof. George Gabriel Stokes, in a paper \"On the Effect\r\nof the Internal Friction of Fluids on the Motion of Pendulums\"[77] that\r\nwas read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on December 9, 1850, had\r\nsolved the hydrodynamical equations to obtain the resistance to the\r\nmotions of a sphere and a cylinder in a viscous fluid. Peirce had\r\nstudied the effect of viscous resistance on the motion of his\r\nRepsold-Bessel pendulum, which was symmetrical in form but not\r\ncylindrical. The mainly cylindrical form of his pendulums (fig. 19)\r\npermitted Peirce to predict from Stokes' theory the effect of viscosity\r\nand to compare the results with experiment. His report of November 20,\r\n1889, in which he presented the comparison of experimental results with\r\nthe theory of Stokes, was not published.[78]\r\n\r\nPeirce used his pendulums in 1883 to establish a station at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution that was to serve as the base station for the\r\nCoast and Geodetic Survey for some years. Pendulum Peirce no. 1 was\r\nswung at Washington in 1881 and was then taken by the party of\r\nLieutenant Greely, U.S.A., on an expedition to Lady Franklin Bay where\r\nit was swung in 1882 at Fort Conger, Grinnell Land, Canada. Peirce nos.\r\n2 and 3 were swung by Peirce in 1882 at Washington, D.C.; Hoboken, New\r\nJersey; Montreal, Canada; and Albany, New York. Assistant Preston took\r\nPeirce no. 3 on a U.S. eclipse expedition to the Caroline Islands in\r\n1883. Peirce in 1885 swung pendulums nos. 2 and 3 at Ann Arbor,\r\nMichigan; Madison, Wisconsin; and Ithaca, New York. Assistant Preston in\r\n1887 swung Peirce nos. 3 and 4 at stations in the Hawaiian Islands, and\r\nin 1890 he swung Peirce nos. 3 and 4 at stations on the west coast of\r\nAfrica.[79]\r\n\r\nThe new pattern of pendulum designed by Peirce was also adopted in\r\nFrance, after some years of experience with a Repsold-Bessel pendulum.\r\nPeirce in 1875 had swung his Repsold-Bessel pendulum at the observatory\r\nin Paris, where Borda and Cassini, and Biot, had made historic\r\nobservations and where Sabine also had determined gravity by comparison\r\nwith Kater's value at London. During the spring of 1880, Peirce made\r\nstudies of the supports for the pendulums of these earlier\r\ndeterminations and calculated corrections to those results for\r\nhydrodynamic effects, viscosity, and flexure. On June 14, 1880, Peirce\r\naddressed the Academy of Sciences, Paris, on the value of gravity at\r\nParis, and compared his results with the corrected results of Borda and\r\nBiot and with the transferred value of Kater.[80]\r\n\r\nIn the same year the French Geographic Service of the Army acquired a\r\nRepsold-Bessel reversible pendulum of the smaller type, and Defforges\r\nconducted experiments with it.[81] He introduced the method of measuring\r\nflexure from the movement of interference fringes during motion of the\r\npendulum. He found an appreciable difference between dynamical and\r\nstatical coefficients of flexure and concluded that the \"correction\r\nformula of Peirce and Cellerier is suited perfectly to practice and\r\nrepresents exactly the variation of period caused by swaying of the\r\nsupport, on the condition that one uses the statical coefficient.\"\r\nDefforges developed a theory for the employment of two similar pendulums\r\nof the same weight, but of different length, and hung by the same\r\nknives. This theory eliminated the flexure of the support and the\r\ncurvature of the knives from the reduction of observations.\r\n\r\nPendulums of 1-meter and of 1/2-meter distance between the knife edges\r\nwere constructed from Defforges' design by Brunner Brothers in Paris\r\n(fig. 21). These Defforges pendulums were cylindrical in form with\r\nhemispherical ends like the Peirce pendulums, and were hung on knives\r\nthat projected from the sides of the pendulum, as in some unfinished\r\nGautier pendulums designed by Peirce in 1883 in Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--REVERSIBLE PENDULUM APPARATUS of Defforges,\r\nas constructed by Brunner, Paris, about 1887. The clock and telescope\r\nused to observe coincidences are not shown. The telescope shown is part\r\nof an interferometer used to measure flexure of the support. One mirror\r\nof the interferometer is attached to the pendulum support; the other to\r\nthe separate masonry pillar at the left.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--BECAUSE OF THE GREATER SIMPLICITY of its use,\r\nthe invariable pendulum superseded the convertible pendulum towards the\r\nend of the 19th century, except at various national base stations (Kew,\r\nParis, Potsdam, Washington, D.C., etc.). Shown here are, right to left,\r\na pendulum of the type used by Peirce at the Hoosac Tunnel in 1873-74,\r\nthe Mendenhall 1/2-second pendulum of 1890, and the pendulum designed by\r\nPeirce in 1881-1882.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--THE OVERALL SIZE of portable pendulum\r\napparatus was greatly reduced with the introduction of this 1/2-second\r\napparatus in 1887, by the Austrian military officer, Robert von\r\nSterneck. Used with a vacuum chamber not shown here, the apparatus is\r\nonly about 2 feet high. Coincidences are observed by the reflection of a\r\nperiodic electric spark in two mirrors, one on the support and the other\r\non the pendulum itself.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--THOMAS C. MENDENHALL (1841-1924). Although\r\nlargely self-educated, he became the first professor of physics and\r\nmechanics at the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (later Ohio\r\nState University), and was subsequently connected with several other\r\nuniversities. In 1878, while teaching at the Tokyo Imperial University\r\nin Japan, he made gravity measurements between Tokyo and Fujiyama from\r\nwhich he calculated the mean density of the earth. While superintendent\r\nof the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1889-94, he developed the\r\npendulum apparatus which bears his name.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVon Sterneck and Mendenhall Pendulums\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile scientists who had used the Repsold-Bessel pendulum apparatus\r\ndiscussed its defects and limitations for gravity surveys, Maj. Robert\r\nvon Sterneck of Austria-Hungary began to develop an excellent apparatus\r\nfor the rapid determination of relative values of gravity.[82] Maj. von\r\nSterneck's apparatus contained a nonreversible pendulum 1/4-meter in\r\nlength, and 1/2-second time of swing. The pendulum was hung by a single\r\nknife edge, which rested on a plate that was supported by a tripod. The\r\npendulum was swung in a chamber from which air was exhausted and which\r\ncould be maintained at any desired temperature. Times of swing were\r\ndetermined by the observation of coincidences of the pendulum with\r\nchronometer signals. In the final form a small mirror was attached to\r\nthe knife edge perpendicular to the plane of vibration of the pendulum\r\nand a second fixed mirror was placed close to it so that the two mirrors\r\nwere parallel when the pendulum was at rest. The chronometer signals\r\nworked a relay that gave a horizontal spark which was reflected into the\r\ntelescope from the mirrors. When the pendulum was at rest, the image of\r\nthe spark in both mirrors appeared on the horizontal cross wire in the\r\ntelescope, and during oscillation of the pendulum the two images\r\nappeared in that position upon coincidence. In view of the reduced size\r\nof the pendulum, the chamber in which it was swung was readily portable,\r\nand with an improved method of observing coincidences, relative\r\ndeterminations of gravity could be made with rapidity and accuracy.\r\n\r\nBy 1887 Maj. von Sterneck had perfected his apparatus, and it was widely\r\nadopted in Europe for relative determinations of gravity. He used his\r\napparatus in extensive gravity surveys and also applied it in the silver\r\nmines in Saxony and Bohemia, by the previously described methods of\r\nAiry, for investigations into the internal constitution of the earth.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1889, Thomas Corwin Mendenhall became superintendent of the\r\nU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Earlier, he had been professor of\r\nphysics at the University of Tokyo and had directed observations of\r\npendulums for the determination of gravity on Fujiyama and at Tokyo.\r\nSupt. Mendenhall, with the cooperation of members of his staff in\r\nWashington, designed a new pendulum apparatus of the Von Sterneck type,\r\nand in October 1890 he ordered construction of the first model.[83]\r\n\r\nLike the Von Sterneck apparatus, the Mendenhall pendulum apparatus\r\nemployed a nonreversible, invariable pendulum 1/4-meter in length and of\r\nslightly more than 1/2-second in time of swing. Initially, the knife\r\nedge was placed in the head of the pendulum and hung on a fixed plane\r\nsupport, but after some experimentation Mendenhall attached the plane\r\nsurface to the pendulum and hung it on a fixed knife edge. An apparatus\r\nwas provided with a set of three pendulums, so that if discrepancies\r\nappeared in the results, the pendulum at fault could be detected. There\r\nwas also a dummy pendulum which carried a thermometer. A pendulum was\r\nswung in a receiver in which the pressure and temperature of the air\r\nwere controlled. The time of swing was measured by coincidences with the\r\nbeat of a chronometer. The coincidences were determined by an optical\r\nmethod with the aid of a flash apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 25.--MENDENHALL'S 1/4-METER (1/2-SECOND)\r\nAPPARATUS. Shown on the left is the flash apparatus and, on the right,\r\nthe vacuum chamber within which the pendulum is swung. The flash\r\napparatus consists of a kerosene lantern and a telescope, mounted on a\r\nbox containing an electromagnetically operated shutter. The operation of\r\nthe shutter is controlled by a chronograph (not shown), so that it emits\r\na slit of light at regular intervals. The telescope is focused on two\r\nmirrors within the apparatus, one fixed, the other attached to the top\r\nof the pendulum. It is used to observe the reflection of the flashes\r\nfrom these mirrors. When the two reflections are aligned, a\r\n\"coincidence\" is marked on the chronograph tape. The second telescope\r\nattached to the bottom of the vacuum chamber is for observing the\r\namplitude of the pendulum swing.]\r\n\r\nThe flash apparatus was contained in a light metal box which supported\r\nan observing telescope and which was mounted on a stand. Within the box\r\nwas an electromagnet whose coils were connected with a chronometer\r\ncircuit and whose armature carried a long arm that moved two shutters,\r\nin both of which were horizontal slits of the same size. The shutters\r\nwere behind the front face of the box, which also had a horizontal slit.\r\nA flash of light from an oil lamp or an electric spark was emitted from\r\nthe box when the circuit was broken, but not when it was closed. When\r\nthe circuit was broken a spring caused the arm to rise, and the shutters\r\nwere actuated so that the three slits came into line and a flash of\r\nlight was emitted. A small circular mirror was set in each side of the\r\npendulum head, so that from either face of the pendulum the image of the\r\nilluminated slit could be reflected into the field of the observing\r\ntelescope. A similar mirror was placed parallel to these two mirrors and\r\nrigidly attached to the support. The chronometer signals broke the\r\ncircuit, causing the three slits momentarily to be in line, and when the\r\nimages of the slit in the two mirrors coincided, a coincidence was\r\nobserved. A coincidence occurred whenever the pendulum gained or lost\r\none oscillation on the beat of the chronometer. The relative intensity\r\nof gravity was determined by observations with the first Mendenhall\r\napparatus at Washington, D.C., at stations on the Pacific Coast and in\r\nAlaska, and at the Stevens Institute, Hoboken, New Jersey, between March\r\nand October 1891.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26.--VACUUM RECEIVER within which the Mendenhall\r\npendulum is swung. The pressure is reduced to about 50 mm. to reduce the\r\ndisturbing effect of air resistance. When the apparatus is sealed, the\r\npendulum is lifted on the knife edge by the lever _q_ and is started to\r\nswing by the lever _r_. The arc of swing is only about 1 deg. The\r\nstationary mirror is shown at _g_. The pendulum shown in outline in the\r\ncenter, is only about 9.7 inches long.]\r\n\r\nUnder Supt. Mendenhall's direction a smaller, 1/4-second, pendulum\r\napparatus was also constructed and tested, but did not offer advantages\r\nover the 1/2-second apparatus, which therefore continued in use.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Peirce's theory of the flexure of the stand under\r\noscillations of the pendulum, determinations of the displacement of the\r\nreceiver of the Mendenhall apparatus were part of a relative\r\ndetermination of gravity by members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.\r\nInitially, a statical method was used, but during 1908-1909 members of\r\nthe Survey adapted the Michelson interferometer for the determinations\r\nof flexure during oscillations from the shift of fringes.[84] The first\r\nMendenhall pendulums were made of bronze, but about 1920 invar was\r\nchosen because of its small coefficient of expansion. About 1930, Lt. E.\r\nJ. Brown of the Coast and Geodetic Survey made significant improvements\r\nin the Mendenhall apparatus, and the new form came to be known as the\r\nBrown Pendulum Apparatus.[85]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.--THE MICHELSON INTERFEROMETER. The horizontal\r\ncomponent of the force acting on the knife edge through the swinging\r\npendulum causes the support to move in unison with the pendulum, and\r\nthereby affects the period of the oscillation. This movement is the\r\nso-called flexure of the pendulum support, and must be taken into\r\naccount in the most accurate observations.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, the Michelson interferometer was adapted to this purpose by the\r\nU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. As shown here, the interferometer,\r\nresting on a wooden beam, is introduced into the path of a light beam\r\nreflected from a mirror on the vacuum chamber. Movement of that mirror\r\ncauses a corresponding movement in the interference fringes in the\r\ninterferometer, which can be measured.]\r\n\r\nThe original Von Sterneck apparatus and that of Mendenhall provided for\r\nthe oscillation of one pendulum at a time. After the adoption of the Von\r\nSterneck pendulum in Europe, there were developed stands on which two or\r\nfour pendulums hung at the same time. This procedure provided a\r\nconvenient way to observe more than one invariable pendulum at a station\r\nfor the purpose of detecting changes in length. Prof. M. Haid of\r\nKarlsruhe in 1896 described a four-pendulum apparatus,[86] and Dr.\r\nSchumann of Potsdam subsequently described a two-pendulum\r\napparatus.[87]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28.--APPARATUS WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN 1929 by the\r\nGulf Research and Development Company, Harmarville, Pennsylvania. It was\r\ndesigned to achieve an accuracy within one ten-millionth of the true\r\nvalue of gravity, and represents the extreme development of pendulum\r\napparatus for relative gravity measurement. The pendulum was designed so\r\nthat the period would be a minimum. The case (the top is missing in this\r\nphotograph) is dehumidified and its temperature and electrostatic\r\ncondition are controlled. Specially designed pendulum-lifting and\r\n-starting mechanisms are used. The problem of flexure of the case is\r\novercome by the Faye-Peirce method (see text) in which two dynamically\r\nmatched pendulums are swung simultaneously, 180 deg. apart in phase.]\r\n\r\nThe multiple-pendulum apparatus then provided a method of determining\r\nthe flexure of the stand from the action of one pendulum upon a second\r\npendulum hung on the same stand. This method of determining the\r\ncorrection for flexure was a development from a \"Wippverfahren\" invented\r\nat the Geodetic Institute in Potsdam. A dynamometer was used to impart\r\nperiodic impulses to the stand, and the effect was observed upon a\r\npendulum initially at rest. Refinements of this method led to the\r\ndevelopment of a method used by Lorenzoni in 1885-1886 to determine the\r\nflexure of the stand by action of an auxiliary pendulum upon the\r\nprincipal pendulum. Dr. Schumann, in 1899, gave a mathematical theory of\r\nsuch determinations,[88] and in his paper cited the mathematical methods\r\nof Peirce and Cellerier for the theory of Faye's proposal at Stuttgart\r\nin 1877 to swing two similar pendulums on the same support with equal\r\namplitudes and in opposite phases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 29.--THE GULF PENDULUM is about 10.7 inches long,\r\nand has a period of .89 second. It is made of fused quartz which is\r\nresistant to the influence of temperature change and to the earth's\r\nmagnetism. Quartz pendulums are subject to the influence of\r\nelectrostatic charge, and provision is made to counteract this through\r\nthe presence of a radium salt in the case. The bearings are made of\r\nPyrex glass.]\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Dr. P. Furtwaengler[89] presented the mathematical theory of\r\ncoupled pendulums in a paper in which he referred to Faye's proposal of\r\n1877 and reported that the difficulties predicted upon its application\r\nhad been found not to occur. Finally, during the gravity survey of\r\nHolland in the years 1913-1921, in view of instability of supports\r\ncaused by the mobility of the soil, F. A. Vening Meinesz adopted Faye's\r\nproposed method of swinging two pendulums on the same support.[90] The\r\nobservations were made with the ordinary Stueckrath apparatus, in which\r\nfour Von Sterneck pendulums swung two by two in planes perpendicular to\r\neach other. This successful application of the method--which had been\r\nproposed by Faye and had been demonstrated theoretically to be sound by\r\nPeirce, who also published a design for its application--was rapidly\r\nfollowed for pendulum apparatus for relative determinations by\r\nPotsdam,[91] Cambridge (England),[92] Gulf Oil and Development\r\nCompany,[93] and the Dominion Observatory at Ottawa.[94] Heiskanen and\r\nVening Meinesz state:\r\n\r\n    The best way to eliminate the effect of flexure is to use two\r\n    synchronized pendulums of the same length swinging on the same\r\n    apparatus in the same plane and with the same amplitudes but in\r\n    opposite phases; it is clear then the flexure is zero.[95]\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the symmetrical reversible pendulum is named\r\nfor Bessel, who created the theory and a design for its application by\r\nRepsold, it appears appropriate to call the method of eliminating\r\nflexure by swinging two pendulums on the same support the Faye-Peirce\r\nmethod. Its successful application was made possible by Maj. von\r\nSterneck's invention of the short, 1/4-meter pendulum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--THE ACCUMULATED DATA OF GRAVITY observations\r\nover the earth's surface have indicated that irregularities such as\r\nmountains do not have the effect which would be expected in modifying\r\ngravity, but are somehow compensated for. The most satisfactory solution\r\nto this still unanswered question has been the theory of isostasy,\r\naccording to which variations in the density of the material in the\r\nearth's crust produce a kind of hydrostatic equilibrium between its\r\nhigher and lower parts, as they \"float\" on the earth's fluid core. The\r\nmetals of different density floating in mercury in this diagram\r\nillustrate isostasy according to the theory of Pratt and Hayford.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolute Value of Gravity at Potsdam\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of the reversible pendulum in the 19th century\r\nculminated in the absolute determination of the intensity of gravity at\r\nPotsdam by Kuehnen and Furtwaengler of the Royal Prussian Geodetic\r\nInstitute, which then became the world base for gravity surveys.[96]\r\n\r\nWe have previously seen that in 1869 the Geodetic Institute--founded by\r\nLt. Gen. Baeyer--had acquired a Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum which\r\nwas swung by Dr. Albrecht under the direction of Dr. Bruhns.\r\nDissatisfaction with this instrument was expressed by Baeyer in 1875 to\r\nCharles S. Peirce, who then, by experiment and mathematical analysis of\r\nthe flexure of the stand under oscillations of the pendulum, determined\r\nthat previously reported results with the Repsold apparatus required\r\ncorrection. Dr. F. R. Helmert, who in 1887 succeeded Baeyer as director\r\nof the Institute, secured construction of a building for the Institute\r\nin Potsdam, and under his direction the scientific study of the\r\nintensity of gravity was pursued with vigor. In 1894, it was discovered\r\nin Potsdam that a pendulum constructed of very flexible material yielded\r\nresults which differed markedly from those obtained with pendulums of\r\ngreater stiffness. Dr. Kuehnen of the Institute discovered that the\r\ndeparture from expectations was the result of the flexure of the\r\npendulum staff itself during oscillations.[97]\r\n\r\nPeirce, in 1883, had discovered that the recesses cut in his pendulums\r\nfor the insertion of tongues that carried the knives had resulted in the\r\nflexure of the pendulum staff.[98] By experiment, he also found an even\r\ngreater flexure for the Repsold pendulum. In order to eliminate this\r\nsource of error, Peirce designed a pendulum with knives that extended\r\nfrom each side of the cylindrical staff, and he received authorization\r\nfrom the superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to arrange for\r\nthe construction of such pendulums by Gautier in Paris. Peirce, who had\r\nmade his plans in consultation with Gautier, was called home before the\r\npendulums were completed, and these new instruments remained\r\nundelivered.\r\n\r\nIn a memoir titled \"Effect of the flexure of a pendulum upon its period\r\nof oscillation,\"[99] Peirce determined analytically the effect on the\r\nperiod of a pendulum with a single elastic connection between two rigid\r\nparts of the staff. Thus, Peirce discovered experimentally the flexure\r\nof the staff and derived for a simplified case the effect on the period.\r\nIt is not known if he ever found the integrated effect of the continuum\r\nof elastic connections in the pendulum. Lorenzoni, in 1896, offered a\r\nsolution to the problem, and Almansi, in 1899, gave an extended\r\nanalysis. After the independent discovery of the problem at the Geodetic\r\nInstitute, Dr. Helmert took up the problem and criticized the theories\r\nof Peirce and Lorenzoni. He then presented his own theory of flexure in\r\na comprehensive memoir.[100] In view of the previous neglect of the\r\nflexure of the pendulum staff in the reduction of observations, Helmert\r\ndirected that the Geodetic Institute make a new absolute determination\r\nof the intensity of gravity at Potsdam. For this purpose, Kuehnen and\r\nFurtwaengler used the following reversible pendulums which had been\r\nconstructed by the firm of A. Repsold and Sons in Hamburg:\r\n\r\n    1. The seconds pendulum of the Geodetic Institute procured in\r\n    1869.\r\n\r\n    2. A seconds pendulum from the Astronomical Observatory, Padua.\r\n\r\n    3. A heavy, seconds pendulum from the Imperial and Royal\r\n    Military-Geographical Institute, Vienna.\r\n\r\n    4. A light, seconds pendulum from the Imperial and Royal\r\n    Military-Geographical Institute.\r\n\r\n    5. A 1/2-second, reversible pendulum of the Geodetic Institute\r\n    procured in 1892.\r\n\r\nWork was begun in 1898, and in 1906 Kuehnen and Furtwaengler published\r\ntheir monumental memoir, \"Bestimmung der Absoluten Groesze der\r\nSchwerkraft zu Potsdam mit Reversionspendeln.\"\r\n\r\nThe acceleration of gravity in the pendulum room of the Geodetic\r\nInstitute was determined to be 981.274 +- 0.003 cm/sec^{2}. In view of the\r\nexceptionally careful and thorough determination at the Institute,\r\nPotsdam was accepted as the world base for the absolute value of the\r\nintensity of gravity. The absolute value of gravity at some other\r\nstation on the Potsdam system was determined from the times of swing of\r\nan invariable pendulum at the station and at Potsdam by the relation\r\n(T_{1})^{2}/(T_{2})^{2} = g_{2}/g_{1}. Thus, in 1900, Assistant G. R.\r\nPutnam of the Coast and Geodetic Survey swung Mendenhall pendulums at\r\nthe Washington base and at Potsdam, and by transfer from Potsdam\r\ndetermined the intensity of gravity at the Washington base to be 980.112\r\ncm/sec^{2}.[101] In 1933, Lt. E. J. Brown made comparative measurements\r\nwith improved apparatus and raised the value at the Washington base to\r\n980.118 cm/sec^{2}.[102]\r\n\r\nIn view of discrepancies between the results of various relative\r\ndeterminations, the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1928 requested the\r\nNational Bureau of Standards to make an absolute determination for\r\nWashington. Heyl and Cook used reversible pendulums made of fused silica\r\nhaving a period of approximately 1 second. Their result, published in\r\n1936, was interpreted to indicate that the value at Potsdam was too high\r\nby 20 parts in 1 million.[103] This estimate was lowered slightly by Sir\r\nHarold Jeffreys of Cambridge, England, who recomputed the results of\r\nHeyl and Cook by different methods.[104]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31.--MAP SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION of gravity\r\nstations throughout the United States as of December 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32.--MAP SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION of gravity\r\nstations throughout the United States in 1923.]\r\n\r\nIn 1939, J. S. Clark published the results of a determination of gravity\r\nwith pendulums of a non-ferrous Y-alloy[105] at the National Physical\r\nLaboratory at Teddington, England, and, after recomputation of results\r\nby Jeffreys, the value was found to be 12.8 parts in 1 million less than\r\nthe value obtained by transfer from Potsdam. Dr. Hugh L. Dryden of the\r\nNational Bureau of Standards, and Dr. A. Berroth of the Geodetic\r\nInstitute at Potsdam, have recomputed the Potsdam data by different\r\nmethods of adjustment and concluded that the Potsdam value was too high\r\nby about 12 parts in a million.[106] Determination of gravity at\r\nLeningrad by Russian scientists likewise has indicated that the 1906\r\nPotsdam value is too high. In the light of present information, it\r\nappears justifiable to reduce the Potsdam value of 981.274 by .013\r\ncm/sec^{2} for purposes of comparison. If the Brown transfer from\r\nPotsdam in 1933 was taken as accurate, the value for the Washington base\r\nwould be 980.105 cm/sec^{2}. In this connection, it is of interest to\r\nnote that the value given by Charles S. Peirce for the comparable\r\nSmithsonian base in Washington, as determined by him from comparative\r\nmethods in the 1880's and reported in the _Annual Report of the\r\nSuperintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the year 1890-1891_,\r\nwas 980.1017 cm/sec^{2}.[107] This value would appear to indicate that\r\nPeirce's pendulums, observations, and methods of reduction of data were\r\nnot inferior to those of the scientists of the Royal Prussian Geodetic\r\nInstitute at Potsdam.\r\n\r\nDoubts concerning the accuracy of the Potsdam value of gravity have\r\nstimulated many new determinations of the intensity of gravity since the\r\nend of World War II. In a paper published in June 1957, A. H. Cook,\r\nMetrology Division, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, England,\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    At present about a dozen new absolute determinations are in\r\n    progress or are being planned. Heyl and Cook's reversible\r\n    pendulum apparatus is in use in Buenos Aires and further\r\n    reversible pendulum experiments have been made in the All Union\r\n    Scientific Research Institute of Metrology, Leningrad (V N I I M)\r\n    and are planned at Potsdam. A method using a very long pendulum\r\n    was tried out in Russia about 1910 and again more recently and\r\n    there are plans for similar work in Finland. The first\r\n    experiment with a freely falling body was that carried out by\r\n    Volet who photographed a graduated scale falling in an enclosure\r\n    at low air pressure. Similar experiments have been completed in\r\n    Leningrad and are in progress at the Physikalisch-Technische\r\n    Bundesanstalt (Brunswick) and at the National Research Council\r\n    (Ottawa), and analogous experiments are being prepared at the\r\n    National Physical Laboratory and at the National Bureau of\r\n    Standards. Finally, Professor Medi, Director of the Istituto\r\n    Nazionale di Geofisica (Rome), is attempting to measure the\r\n    focal length of the paraboloidal surface of a liquid in a\r\n    rotating dish.[108]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication of Gravity Surveys\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have noted previously that in the ancient and early modern periods,\r\nthe earth was presupposed to be spherical in form. Determination of the\r\nfigure of the earth consisted in the measurement of the radius by the\r\nastronomical-geodetic method invented by Eratosthenes. Since the earth\r\nwas assumed to be spherical, gravity was inferred to be constant over\r\nthe surface of the earth. This conclusion appeared to be confirmed by\r\nthe determination of the length of the seconds pendulum at various\r\nstations in Europe by Picard and others. The observations of Richer in\r\nSouth America, the theoretical discussions of Newton and Huygens, and\r\nthe measurements of degrees of latitude in Peru and Sweden demonstrated\r\nthat the earth is an oblate spheroid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33.--GRAVITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GLOBE.\r\nDeductions as to the distribution of matter in the earth can be made\r\nfrom gravity measurements. This globe shows worldwide variations in\r\ngravity as they now appear from observations at sea (in submarines) as\r\nwell as on land. It is based on data from the Institute of Geodesy at\r\nOhio State University.]\r\n\r\nThe theory of gravitation and the theory of central forces led to the\r\nresult that the intensity of gravity is variable over the surface of the\r\nearth. Accordingly, determinations of the intensity of gravity became\r\nof value to the geodesist as a means of determining the figure of the\r\nearth. Newton, on the basis of the meager data available to him,\r\ncalculated the ellipticity of the earth to be 1/230 (the ellipticity is\r\ndefined by (a-b)/a, where a is the equatorial radius and b the polar\r\nradius). Observations of the intensity of gravity were made on the\r\nhistoric missions to Peru and Sweden. Bouguer and La Condamine found\r\nthat at the equator at sea level the seconds pendulum was 1.26\r\nParis-lines shorter than at Paris. Maupertuis found that in northern\r\nSweden a certain pendulum clock gained 59.1 seconds per day on its rate\r\nin Paris. Then Clairaut, from the assumption that the earth is a\r\nspheroid of equilibrium, derived a theorem from which the ellipticity of\r\nthe earth can be derived from values of the intensity of gravity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34.--AN EXHIBIT OF GRAVITY APPARATUS at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. Suspended on the wall, from left to right, are\r\nthe invariable pendulums of Mendenhall (1/2-second), Peirce (1873-1874),\r\nand Peirce (1881-1882); the double pendulum of Edward Kuebel (see fig.\r\n15, p. 319), and the reversible pendulum of Peirce. On the display\r\ncounter, from left to right, are the vacuum chamber, telescope and flash\r\napparatus for the Mendenhall 1/4-second apparatus. Shown below these are\r\nthe four pendulums used with the Mendenhall apparatus, the one on the\r\nright having a thermometer attached. At bottom, right, is the Gulf\r\napparatus (cover removed) mentioned in the text, shown with one quartz\r\npendulum.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the 19th century a systematic series of observations began to\r\nbe conducted in order to determine the intensity of gravity at stations\r\nall over the world. Kater invariable pendulums, of which 13 examples\r\nhave been mentioned in the literature, were used in surveys of gravity\r\nby Kater, Sabine, Goldingham, and other British pendulum swingers. As\r\nhas been noted previously, a Kater invariable pendulum was used by Adm.\r\nLuetke of Russia on a trip around the world. The French also sent out\r\nexpeditions to determine values of gravity. After several decades of\r\nrelative inactivity, Capts. Basevi and Heaviside of the Indian Survey\r\ncarried out an important series of observations from 1865 to 1873 with\r\nKater invariable pendulums and the Russian Repsold-Bessel pendulums. In\r\n1881-1882 Maj. J. Herschel swung Kater invariable pendulums nos. 4, 6\r\n(1821), and 11 at stations in England and then brought them to the\r\nUnited States in order to make observations which would connect American\r\nand English base stations.[109]\r\n\r\nThe extensive sets of observations of gravity provided the basis of\r\ncalculations of the ellipticity of the earth. Col. A. R. Clarke in his\r\n_Geodesy_ (London, 1880) calculated the ellipticity from the results of\r\ngravity surveys to be 1/(292.2 +- 1.5). Of interest is the calculation by\r\nCharles S. Peirce, who used only determinations made with Kater\r\ninvariable pendulums and corrected for elevation, atmospheric effect,\r\nand expansion of the pendulum through temperature.[110] He calculated\r\nthe ellipticity of the earth to be 1/(291.5 +- 0.9).\r\n\r\nThe 19th century witnessed the culmination of the ellipsoidal era of\r\ngeodesy, but the rapid accumulation of data made possible a better\r\napproximation to the figure of the earth by the geoid. The geoid is\r\ndefined as the average level of the sea, which is thought of as extended\r\nthrough the continents. The basis of geodetic calculations, however, is\r\nan ellipsoid of reference for which a gravity formula expresses the\r\nvalue of normal gravity at a point on the ellipsoid as a function of\r\ngravity at sea level at the equator, and of latitude. The general\r\nassembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, which was\r\nfounded after World War I to continue the work of _Die Internationale\r\nErdmessung_, adopted in 1924 an international reference ellipsoid,[111]\r\nof which the ellipticity, or flattening, is Hayford's value 1/297. In\r\n1930, the general assembly adopted a correlated International Gravity\r\nFormula of the form\r\n\r\n[gamma] = [gamma]_{E}(1 + [beta]sin^{2} [phi] + [epsilon]sin^{2} 2[phi])\r\n\r\nwhere [gamma] is normal gravity at latitude [phi], [gamma]_{E} is the\r\nvalue of gravity at sea level at the equator, [beta] is a parameter\r\nwhich is computed on the basis of Clairaut's theorem from the flattening\r\nvalue of the meridian, and [epsilon] is a constant which is derived\r\ntheoretically. The plumb line is perpendicular to the geoid, and the\r\ncomponents of angle between the perpendiculars to geoid and reference\r\nellipsoid are deflections of the vertical. The geoid is above the\r\nellipsoid of reference under mountains and it is below the ellipsoid on\r\nthe oceans, where the geoid coincides with mean sea level. In physical\r\ngeodesy, gravimetric data are used for the determination of the geoid\r\nand components of deflections of the vertical. For this purpose, one\r\nmust reduce observed values of gravity to sea level by various\r\nreductions, such as free-air, Bouguer, isostatic reductions. If g_{0} is\r\nobserved gravity reduced to sea level and [gamma] is normal gravity\r\nobtained from the International Gravity Formula, then\r\n\r\n  [Delta]g = g_{0} - [gamma]\r\n\r\nis the gravity anomaly.[112]\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Stokes derived a theorem whereby the distance N of the geoid\r\nfrom the ellipsoid of reference can be obtained from an integration of\r\ngravity anomalies over the surface of the earth. Vening Meinesz further\r\nderived formulae for the calculation of components of the deflection of\r\nthe vertical.\r\n\r\nGeometrical geodesy, which was based on astronomical-geodetic methods,\r\ncould give information only concerning the external form of the figure\r\nof the earth. The gravimetric methods of physical geodesy, in\r\nconjunction with methods such as those of seismology, enable scientists\r\nto test hypotheses concerning the internal structure of the earth.\r\nHeiskanen and Vening Meinesz summarize the present-day achievements of\r\nthe gravimetric method of physical geodesy by stating[113] that it\r\nalone can give:\r\n\r\n    1. The flattening of the reference ellipsoid.\r\n\r\n    2. The undulations N of the geoid.\r\n\r\n    3. The components of the deflection of the vertical [xi] and\r\n    [eta] at any point, oceans and islands included.\r\n\r\n    4. The conversion of existing geodetic systems to the same world\r\n    geodetic system.\r\n\r\n    5. The reduction of triangulation base lines from the geoid to\r\n    the reference ellipsoid.\r\n\r\n    6. The correction of errors in triangulation in mountainous\r\n    regions due to the effect of the deflections of the vertical.\r\n\r\n    7. Geophysical applications of gravity measurements, e.g., the\r\n    isostatic study of the earth's interior and the exploration of\r\n    oil fields and ore deposits.\r\n\r\nWith astronomical observations or with existing triangulations, the\r\ngravimetric method can accomplish further results. Heiskanen and Vening\r\nMeinesz state:\r\n\r\n    It is the firm conviction of the authors that the gravimetric\r\n    method is by far the best of the existing methods for solving\r\n    the main problems of geodesy, i.e., to determine the shape of\r\n    the geoid on the continents as well as at sea and to convert the\r\n    existing geodetic systems to the world geodetic system. It can\r\n    also give invaluable help in the computation of the reference\r\n    ellipsoid.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the creation of classical mechanics in the 17th century, the\r\npendulum has been a basic instrument for the determination of the\r\nintensity of gravity, which is expressed as the acceleration of a freely\r\nfalling body. Basis of theory is the simple pendulum, whose time of\r\nswing under gravity is proportional to the square root of the length\r\ndivided by the acceleration due to gravity. Since the length of a simple\r\npendulum divided by the square of its time of swing is equal to the\r\nlength of a pendulum that beats seconds, the intensity of gravity also\r\nhas been expressed in terms of the length of the seconds pendulum. The\r\nreversible compound pendulum has served for the absolute determination\r\nof gravity by means of a theory developed by Huygens. Invariable\r\ncompound pendulums with single axes also have been used to determine\r\nrelative values of gravity by comparative times of swing.\r\n\r\nThe history of gravity pendulums begins with the ball or \"simple\"\r\npendulum of Galileo as an approximation to the ideal simple pendulum.\r\nDeterminations of the length of the seconds pendulum by French\r\nscientists culminated in a historic determination at Paris by Borda and\r\nCassini, from the corrected observations with a long ball pendulum. In\r\nthe 19th century, Bessel found the length of the seconds pendulum at\r\nKoenigsberg and Berlin by observations with a ball pendulum and by\r\noriginal theoretical considerations. During the century, however, the\r\ncompound pendulum came to be preferred for absolute and relative\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\nCapt. Henry Kater, at London, constructed the first convertible compound\r\nfor an absolute determination of gravity, and then he designed an\r\ninvariable compound pendulum, examples of which were used for relative\r\ndeterminations at various stations in Europe and elsewhere. Bessel\r\ndemonstrated theoretically the advantages of a reversible compound\r\npendulum which is symmetrical in form and is hung by interchangeable\r\nknives. The firm of A. Repsold and Sons in Hamburg constructed pendulums\r\nfrom the specifications of Bessel for European gravity surveys.\r\n\r\nCharles S. Peirce in 1875 received delivery in Hamburg of a\r\nRepsold-Bessel pendulum for the U.S. Coast Survey and observed with it\r\nin Geneva, Paris, Berlin, and London. Upon an initial stimulation from\r\nBaeyer, founder of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_, Peirce demonstrated by\r\nexperiment and theory that results previously obtained with the Repsold\r\napparatus required correction, because of the flexure of the stand under\r\noscillations of the pendulum. At the Stuttgart conference of the\r\ngeodetic association in 1877, Herve Faye proposed to solve the problem\r\nof flexure by swinging two similar pendulums from the same support with\r\nequal amplitudes and in opposite phases. Peirce, in 1879, demonstrated\r\ntheoretically the soundness of the method and presented a design for its\r\napplication, but the \"double pendulum\" was rejected at that time. Peirce\r\nalso designed and had constructed four examples of a new type of\r\ninvariable, reversible pendulum of cylindrical form which made possible\r\nthe experimental study of Stokes' theory of the resistance to motion of\r\na pendulum in a viscous fluid. Commandant Defforges, of France, also\r\ndesigned and used cylindrical reversible pendulums, but of different\r\nlength so that the effect of flexure was eliminated in the reduction of\r\nobservations. Maj. Robert von Sterneck, of Austria-Hungary, initiated a\r\nnew era in gravity research by the invention of an apparatus with a\r\nshort pendulum for relative determinations of gravity. Stands were then\r\nconstructed in Europe on which two or four pendulums were hung at the\r\nsame time. Finally, early in the present century, Vening Meinesz found\r\nthat the Faye-Peirce method of swinging pendulums hung on a Stueckrath\r\nfour-pendulum stand solved the problem of instability due to the\r\nmobility of the soil in Holland.\r\n\r\nThe 20th century has witnessed increasing activity in the determination\r\nof absolute and relative values of gravity. Gravimeters have been\r\nperfected and have been widely used for rapid relative determinations,\r\nbut the compound pendulums remain as indispensable instruments.\r\nMendenhall's replacement of knives by planes attached to nonreversible\r\npendulums has been used also for reversible ones. The Geodetic Institute\r\nat Potsdam is presently applying the Faye-Peirce method to the\r\nreversible pendulum.[115] Pendulums have been constructed of new\r\nmaterials, such as invar, fused silica, and fused quartz. Minimum\r\npendulums for precise relative determinations have been constructed and\r\nused. Reversible pendulums have been made with \"I\" cross sections for\r\nbetter stiffness. With all these modifications, however, the foundations\r\nof the present designs of compound pendulum apparatus were created in\r\nthe 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    [1] The basic historical documents have been collected, with a\r\n        bibliography of works and memoirs published from 1629 to the end\r\n        of 1885, in _Collection de memoires relatifs a la physique,\r\n        publies par la Societe francaise de Physique_ [hereinafter\r\n        referred to as _Collection de memoires_]: vol. 4, _Memoires sur\r\n        le pendule, precedes d'une bibliographie_ (Paris:\r\n        Gauthier-Villars, 1889); and vol. 5, _Memoires sur le pendule_,\r\n        part 2 (Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1891).
