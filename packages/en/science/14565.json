He was born on the\r\n14th of September, 1769, and is, therefore, now in his 80th year.  After\r\ngoing through the ordinary course of education at Gottingen, and having made\r\na rapid tour through Holland, England, and France, he became a pupil of\r\nWerner at the mining school of Freyburg, and in his 21st year published an\r\n\"Essay on the Basalts of the Rhine.\"  Though he soon became officially\r\nconnected with the mining corps, he was enabled to continue his excursions\r\nin foreign countries, for, during the six or seven years succeeding the\r\npublication of his first essay, he seems to have visited Austria,\r\nSwitzerland, Italy, and France.  His attention to mining did not, however,\r\nprevent him from devoting his attention to other scientific pursuits, among\r\nwhich botany and the then recent discovery of galvanism may be especially\r\nnoticed.  Botany, indeed, we know from his own authority, occupied him\r\nalmost exclusively for some years; but even at this time he was practicing\r\nthe use of those astronomical and physical instruments which he afterward\r\nturned to so singularly excellent an account.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *For the following remarks I am mainly indebted to the articles\r\non the Cosmos in the two leading Quarterly Reviews.\r\n\r\nThe political disturbances of the civilized world at the close\r\np 4\r\nof the last century prevented our author from carrying out various plans of\r\nforeign travel which he had contemplated, and detained him an unwilling\r\nprisoner in Europe.  In the year 1799 he went to Spain, with the hope of\r\nentering Africa from Cadiz, but the unexpected patronage which he received\r\nat the court of Madrid led to a great alteration in his plans, and decided\r\nhim to proceed directly to the Spanish possessions in America, \"and there\r\ngratify the longings for foreign adventure, and the scenery of the tropics,\r\nwhich had haunted him from boyhood, but had all along been turned in the\r\ndiametrically opposite direction of Asia.\"  After encountering various risks\r\nof capture, he succeeded in reaching America, and from 1799 to 1804\r\nprosecuted there extensive researches in the physical geography of the New\r\nWorld, which has indelibly stamped his name in the undying records of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nExcepting an excursion to Naples with Gay-Lussac and Von Buch in 1805 (the\r\nyear after his return from America), the succeeding twenty years of his life\r\nwere spent in Paris, and were almost exclusively employed in editing the\r\nresults of his American journey.  In order to bring these results before the\r\nworld in a manner worthy of their importance, he commenced a series of\r\ngigantic publications in almost every branch of science on which he had\r\ninstituted observations.  In 1817, after twelve years of incessant toil,\r\nfour fifths were completed, and an ordinary copy of the part then in print\r\ncost considerably more than one hundred pounds sterling.  Since that time\r\nthe publication has gone on more slowly, and even now after the lapse of\r\nnearly half a century, it remains, and probably ever will remain, incomplete.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1828, when the greatest portion of his literary labor had been\r\naccomplished, he undertook a scientific journey to Siberia, under the\r\nspecial protection of the Russian government.  In this journey -- a journey\r\nfor which he had prepared himself by a course of study unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of travel -- he was accompanied by two companions hardly less\r\ndistinguished than himself, Ehrenberg and Gustav Rose, and\r\np 5\r\nthe results obtained during their expedition are recorded by our author in\r\nhis 'Fragments Asiatiques', and in his 'Asie Centrale', and by Rose in his\r\n'Reise nach dem Oural'.  If the 'Asie Centrale' had been his only work,\r\nconstituting, as it does, an epitome of all the knowledge acquired by\r\nhimself and by former travelers on the physical geography of Northern and\r\nCentral Asia, that work alone would have sufficed to form a reputation of\r\nthe highest order.\r\n\r\nI proceed to offer a few remarks on the work of which I now present a new\r\ntranslation to the English public, a work intended by its author \"to embrace\r\na summary of physical knowledge, as connected with a delineation of the\r\nmaterial universe.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of such a physical description of the universe had, it appears,\r\nbeen present to his mind from a very early epoch.  It was a work which he\r\nfelt he must accomplish, and he devoted almost a lifetime to the\r\naccumulation of materials for it.  For almost half a century it had occupied\r\nhis thoughts; and at length, in the evening of life, he felt himself rich\r\nenough in the accumulation of thought, travel, reading, and experimental\r\nresearch, to reduce into form and reality the undefined vision that has so\r\nlong floated before him.  The work, when completed, will form three volumes.\r\n The 'first' volume comprises a sketch of all that is at present known of\r\nthe physical phenomena of the universe; the 'second' comprehends two\r\ndistinct parts, the first of which treats of the incitements to the study of\r\nnature, afforded in descriptive poetry, landscape painting, and the\r\ncultivation of exotic plants; while the second and larger part enters into\r\nthe consideration of the different epochs in the progress of discovery and\r\nof the corresponding stages of advance in human civilization.  The 'third'\r\nvolume, the publication of which, as M. Humboldt himself informs me in a\r\nletter addressed to my learned friend and publisher, Mr. H. G. Bohn, \"has\r\nbeen somewhat delayed, owing to the present state of public affairs, will\r\ncomprise the special and scientific development of the great Picture of\r\nNature\r\np 6\r\nEach of the three parts of the 'Cosmos' is therefore, to a certain extent,\r\ndistinct in its object, and may be considered complete in itself.  We can\r\nnot better terminate this brief notice than in the words of one of the most\r\neminent philosophers of our own country, that, \"should the conclusion\r\ncorrespond (as we doubt not) with these beginnings, a work will have been\r\naccomplished every way worthy of the author's fame, and a crowning laurel\r\nadded to that wreath with which Europe will always delight to surround the\r\nname of Alexander von Humboldt.\"\r\n\r\nIn venturing to appear before the English public as the interpreter of \"the\r\ngreat work of our age,\"* I have been encouraged by the assistance of many\r\nkind literary and scientific friends, and I gladly avail myself of this\r\nopportunity of expressing my deep obligations to Mr. Brooke, Dr. Day,\r\nProfessor Edward Forbes, Mr. Hind, Mr. Glaisher, Dr. Percy, and Mr. Ronalds,\r\nfor the valuable aid they  have afforded me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *The expression applied to the Cosmos by the learned Bunsen, in\r\nhis late Report on Ethnology, in the 'Report of the British Association for'\r\n1847, p. 265.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be scarcely right to conclude these remarks without a reference to\r\nthe translations that have preceded mine.  The translation executed by Mrs.\r\nSabine is singularly accurate and elegant.  The other translation is\r\nremarkable for the opposite qualities, and may therefore be passed over in\r\nsilence.  The present volumes differ from those of Mrs. Sabine in having all\r\nthe foreign measures converted into corresponding English terms, in being\r\npublished at considerably less than one third of the price, and in being a\r\ntranslation of the entire work, for I have not conceived myself justified in\r\nomitting passages, sometimes amounting to pages, simply because they might\r\nbe deemed slightly obnoxious to our national prejudices.\r\n\r\n\r\np 7\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE.\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nIn the late evening of an active life I offer to the German public a work,\r\nwhose undefined image has floated before my mind for almost half a century.\r\nI have frequently looked upon its completion as impracticable, but as often\r\nas I have been disposed to relinquish the undertaking, I have again --\r\nalthough perhaps imprudently -- resumed the task.  This work I now present\r\nto my contemporaries with a diffidence inspired by a just mistrust of my own\r\npowers, while I would willingly forget that writings long expected are\r\nusually received with less indulgence.\r\n\r\nAlthough the outward relations of life, and an irresistible impulse toward\r\nknowledge of various kinds, have led me to occupy myself for many years --\r\nand apparently exclusively -- with separate branches of science, as, for\r\ninstance, with descriptive botany, geognosy, chemistry, astronomical\r\ndeterminations of position, and terrestrial magnetism, in order that I might\r\nthe better prepare myself for the extensive travels in which I was desirous\r\nof engaging, the actual object of my studies has nevertheless been of a\r\nhigher character.  The principal impulse by which I was directed was the\r\nearnest endeavor to comprehend the phenomena of physical objects in their\r\ngeneral connection, and to represent nature as one great whole, moved and\r\nanimated by internal forces.  My intercourse with highly-gifted men early\r\nled me to discover that, without an earnest striving to attain to a\r\nknowledge of special branches of study, all attempts to give a grand and\r\ngeneral view of the universe would be nothing more than a vain illusion.\r\nThese special departments in the great domain of natural\r\np 8\r\nscience are, moreover, capable of being reciprocally fructified by means of\r\nthe appropriative forces by which they are endowed.  Descriptive botany, no\r\nlonger confined to the narrow circle of the determination of genera and\r\nspecies, leads the observer who traverses distant lands and lofty mountains\r\nto the study of the geographical distribution of plants of the earth's\r\nsurface, according to distance from the equator and vertical elevation above\r\nthe sea.  It is further necessary to investigate the laws which regulate the\r\ndifferences of temperature and climate, and the meteorological processes of\r\nthe atmosphere, before we can hope to explain the involved causes of\r\nvegetable distribution; and it is thus that the observer who earnestly\r\npursues the path of knowledge is led from one class of phenomena to another,\r\nby means of the mutual dependence and connection existing between them.\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed an advantage which few scientific travelers have shared to an\r\nequal extent, viz., that of having seen not only littoral districts, such as\r\nare alone visited by the majority of those who take part in voyages of\r\ncircumnavigation, but also those portions of the interior of two vast\r\ncontinents which present the most striking contrasts manifested in the\r\nAlpine tropical landscapes of South America, and the dreary wastes of the\r\nsteppes in Northern Asia.  Travels, undertaken in districts such as these,\r\ncould not fail to encourage the natural tendency of my mind toward a\r\ngeneralization of views, and to encourage me to attempt, in a special work,\r\nto treat of the knowledge which we at present possess, regarding the\r\nsidereal and terrestrial phenomena of the Cosmos in their empirical\r\nrelations.  The hitherto undefined idea of a physical geography has thus, by\r\nan extended and perhaps too boldly imagined a plan, been comprehended under\r\nthe idea of a physical description of the universe, embracing all created\r\nthings in the regions of space and in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe very abundance of the materials which are presented to the mind for\r\narrangement and definition, necessarily impart no inconsiderable\r\ndifficulties in the choice of the form under\r\np 9\r\nwhich such a work must be presented, if it would aspire to the honor of\r\nbeing regarded as a literary composition.  Descriptions of nature ought not\r\nto be deficient in a tone of life-like truthfulness, while the mere\r\nenumeration of a series of general results is productive of a no less\r\nwearying impression than the elaborate accumulation of the individual data\r\nof observation.  I scarcely venture to hope that I have succeeded in\r\nsatisfying these various requirements of composition, or that I have myself\r\navoided the shoals and breakers which I have known how to indicate to\r\nothers.  My faint hope of success rests upon the special indulgence which\r\nthe German public have bestowed upon a small work bearing the title of\r\n'Ansichten der Natur', which I published soon after my return from Mexico.\r\nThis work treats, under general points of view, of separate branches of\r\nphysical geography (such as the forms of vegetation, grassy plains, and\r\ndeserts).  The effect produced by this small volume has doubtlessly been\r\nmore powerfully manifested in the influence it has exercised on the\r\nsensitive minds of the young, whose imaginative faculties are so strongly\r\nmanifested, than by means of any thing which it could itself impart.  In the\r\nwork on the Cosmos on which I am now engaged, I have endeavored to show, as\r\nin that entitled 'Ansichten der Natur', that a certain degree of scientific\r\ncompleteness in the treatment of individual facts is not wholly incompatible\r\nwith a picturesque animation of style.\r\nSince public lectures seemed to me to present an easy and efficient means of\r\ntesting the more or less successful manner of connecting together the\r\ndetached branches of any one science, I undertook, for many months\r\nconsecutively, first in the French language, at Paris, and afterward in my\r\nown native German, at Berlin (almost simultaneously at two different places\r\nof assembly), to deliver a course of lectures on the physical description of\r\nthe universe, according to my conception of the science.  My lectures were\r\ngiven extemporaneously, both in French and German, and without the aid of\r\nwritten notes, nor have I, in any way, made use, in the present work,\r\np 10\r\nof those portions of my discourses which have been preserved by the industry\r\nof certain attentive auditors.  With the exception of the first forty pages,\r\nthe whole of the present work was written, for the first time, in the years\r\n1843 and 1844.\r\n\r\nA character of unity, freshness, and animation must, I think, be derived\r\nfrom an association with some definite epoch, where the object of the writer\r\nis to delineate the present condition of knowledge and opinions.  Since the\r\nadditions constantly made to the latter give rise to fundamental changes in\r\npre-existing views, my lectures and the Cosmos have nothing in common beyond\r\nthe succession in which the various facts are treated.  The first portion of\r\nmy work contains introductory considerations regarding the diversity in the\r\ndegrees of enjoyment to be derived from nature, and the knowledge of the\r\nlaws by which the universe is governed; it also considers the limitation and\r\nscientific mode of treating a physical description of the universe, and\r\ngives a general picture of nature which contains a view of all the phenomena\r\ncomprised in the Cosmos.\r\n\r\nThis general picture of nature, which embraces within its wide scope the\r\nremotest nebulous spots, and the revolving double stars in the regions of\r\nspace, no less than the telluric phenomena included under the department of\r\nthe geography of organic forms (such as plants, animals, and races of men),\r\ncomprises all that I deem most specially important with regard to the\r\nconnection existing between generalities and specialities, while it moreover\r\nexemplifies, by the form and style of the composition, the mode of treatment\r\npursued in the selection of the results obtained from experimental\r\nknowledge.  The two succeeding volumes will contain a consideration of the\r\nparticular means of incitement toward the study of nature (consisting in\r\nanimated delineations, landscape painting, and the arrangement and\r\ncultivation of exotic vegetable forms), of the history of the contemplation\r\nof the universe, or the gradual development of the reciprocal action of\r\nnatural forces constituting one natural whole; and lastly, of the special\r\np 11\r\nbranches of the several departments of science, whose mutual connection is\r\nindicated in the beginning of the work.  Wherever it has been possible to do\r\nso, I have adduced the authorities from whence I derived my facts, with a\r\nview of affording testimony both to the accuracy of my statements and to the\r\nvalue of the observations to which reference was made.  In those instances\r\nwhere I have quoted from my own writings (the facts contained in which\r\nbeing, from their very nature, scattered through different portions of my\r\nworks), I have always referred to the original editions, owing to the\r\nimportance of accuracy with regard to numerical relations, and to my own\r\ndistrust of the care and correctness of translators.  In the few cases where\r\nI have extracted short passages from the works of my friends, I have\r\nindicated them by marks of quotation; and, in imitation of the practice of\r\nthe ancients, I have invariably preferred the repetition of the same words\r\nto any arbitrary substitution of my own paraphrases.  The much-contested\r\nquestion of priority of claim to a first discovery, which it is so dangerous\r\nto treat of in a work of this uncontroversial kind, has rarely been touched\r\nupon.  Where I have occasionally referred to classical antiquity, and to\r\nthat happy period of transition which has rendered the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries so celebrated, owing to the great geographical\r\ndiscoveries by which the age was characterized, I have been simply led to\r\nadopt this mode of treatment, from the desire we experience from time to\r\ntime, when considering the general views of nature, to escape from the\r\ncircle of more strictly dogmatical modern opinions, and enter the free and\r\nfanciful domain of earlier presentiments.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been regarded as a subject of discouraging consideration,\r\nthat while purely literary products of intellectual activity are rooted in\r\nthe depths of feeling, and interwoven with the creative force of\r\nimagination, all works treating of empirical knowledge, and of the\r\nconnection of natural phenomena and physical laws, are subject to the most\r\nmarked modifications of form in the lapse of short periods of time, both\r\np 12\r\nby the improvement in the instruments used, and by the consequent expansion\r\nof the field of view opened to rational observation, and that those\r\nscientific works which have, to use a common expression, become 'antiquated'\r\nby the acquisition of new funds of knowledge, are thus continually being\r\nconsigned to oblivion as unreadable.  However discouraging such a prospect\r\nmust be, no one who is animated by a genuine love of nature, and by a sense\r\nof the dignity attached to its study, can view with regret any thing which\r\npromises future additions and a greater degree of perfection to general\r\nknowledge.  Many important branches of knowledge have been based upon a\r\nsolid foundation which will not easily be shaken, both as regards the\r\nphenomena in the regions of space and on the earth; while there are other\r\nportions of science in which general views will undoubtedly take the place\r\nof merely special; where new forces will be discovered and new substances\r\nwill be made known, and where those which are now considered as simple will\r\nbe decomposed.  I would, therefore, venture to hope that an attempt to\r\ndelineate nature in all its vivid animation and exalted grandeur, and to\r\ntrace the 'stable' amid the vacillating, ever-recurring alternation of\r\nphysical metamorphoses, will not be wholly disregarded even at a future age.\r\n'Potsdam, Nov.', 1844.\r\n\r\nThis material taken from pages 13-22\r\nNB - The page numbers will be properly aligned in Courier 12 font.\r\n\r\nCOSMOS: A Sketch of the Physical Description of the Universe, Vol. 1\r\nby Alexander von Humboldt\r\n\r\nTranslated by E C Otte\r\n\r\nfrom the 1858 Harper & Brothers edition of Cosmos, volume 1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\np 13\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

and the scientific Exposition of the Laws of\r\nthe Universe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n. .  .Page 23-78\r\n\r\nInsight into the connection of phenomena as the aim of all natural\r\ninvestigation.  Nature presents itself to meditative contemplation as a\r\nunity in diversity.  Differences in the grades of enjoyment yielded by\r\nnature.  Effect of contact with free nature; enjoyment derived from nature\r\nindependently of a knowledge of the action of natural forces, or of the\r\nphysiognomy and configuration of the surface, or of the character of\r\nvegetation.  Reminiscences of the woody valleys of the Cordilleras and of\r\nthe Peak of Teneriffe.  Advantages of the mountainous region near the\r\nequator, where the multiplicity of natural impressions attains its maximum\r\nwithin the most circumscribed limits, and where it is permitted to man\r\nsimultaneously to behold all the stars of the firmament and all the forms of\r\nvegetation -- p. 23-33.\r\n\r\nTendency toward the investigation of the causes of physical phenomena.\r\nErroneous views of the character of natural forces arising from an imperfect\r\nmode of observation or of induction.  The crude accumulation of physical\r\ndogmas transmitted from one country to another.  Their diffusion among the\r\nhigher classes.\r\nScientific physics are associated with another and a deep-rooted system of\r\nuntried and misunderstood experimental positions.  Investigation of natural\r\nlaws.  Apprehension that nature may lose a portion of its secret charm by an\r\ninquiry into the internal character of its forces, and that the enjoyment of\r\nnature must necessarily be weakened by a study of its domain.  Advantages of\r\ngeneral views which impart an exalted and solemn character to natural\r\nscience.  The possibility of separating generalities from specialties.\r\nExamples drawn from astronomy, recent optical discoveries, physical\r\ngeognosy, and the geography of plants.  Practicability of the study of\r\nphysical cosmography -- p. 33-54.  Misunderstood popular knowledge,\r\nconfounding cosmography with a mere encyclopedic enumeration of natural\r\nsciences.  Necessity for a simultaneous regard for all branches of natural\r\nscience.  Influence of this study on national prosperity and the welfare of\r\nnations; its more earnest and characteristic aim is an inner one, arising\r\nfrom exalted mental activity.  Mode of treatment with regard to the object\r\nand presentation; reciprocal connection existing between thought and speech\r\n-- p. 54-56.\r\n\r\nThe notes to p. 28-33.

Fishes of an earlier world -- p. 46.\r\n\r\nLimits and Method of Exposition of the Physical Description of the Universe\r\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . .\r\nPage 56-78\r\n\r\nSubjects embraced by the study of the Cosmos or of physical cosmography.\r\nSeparation of other kindred studies -- p. 56-62.  The uranological portion\r\nof the Cosmos is more simple than the telluric; the impossibility of\r\nascertaining the diversity of matter simplifies the study of the mechanism\r\nof the heavens.  Origin of the word 'Cosmos', its signification of adornment\r\nand order of the universe.  The 'existing' can not be absolutely separated\r\nin our contemplation of nature from the 'future'.  History of the world and\r\ndescription of the world -- p. 26-73.\r\nAttempts to embrace the multiplicity of the phenomena of the Cosmos in the\r\nunity of thought and under the form of a purely rational combination.\r\nNatural philosophy, which preceded all exact observation in antiquity, is a\r\nnatural, but not unfrequently ill-directed, effort of reason.  Two forms of\r\nabstraction rule in the whole mass of knowledge, viz.:  the 'quantitative',\r\nrelative determinations according to number and magnitude, and\r\n'qualitative', material characters.  Means of submitting phenomena to\r\ncalculation.  Atoms, mechanical methods of construction.  Figurative\r\nrepresentations; mythical conception of imponderable matters, and the\r\npeculiar vital forces in every organism.  That which is attained by\r\nobservation and experiment (calling forth phenomena) leads, by analogy and\r\ninduction, to a knowledge of 'empirical laws'; their gradual simplification\r\nand generalization.  Arrangement of the facts discovered in accordance with\r\nleading ideas.  The treasure of empirical contemplation, collected through\r\nages, is in no danger of experiencing any hostile agency from philosophy --\r\np. 73-78.\r\n\r\n[In the notes appended to p. 66-70 are considerations of the general and\r\ncomparative geography of Varenius.  Philological investigation into the\r\nmeaning of the words [Greek word] and 'mundus'.]\r\n\r\nDelineation of Nature.  General Review of Natural Phenomena. . . . . p.\r\n79-359\r\n\r\nIntroduction -- p. 79-83.  A descriptive delineation of the world embraces\r\nthe whole universe ([Greek words]) in the celestial and terrestrial spheres.\r\n Form and course of the representation.  It begins with the laws of\r\ngravitation, and with the region of the remotest nebulous spots and double\r\nstars, and then, gradually descending through the starry stratum to which\r\nour solar system belongs, it contemplates this terrestrial spheroid,\r\nsurrounded by air and water, and finally, proceeds to the consideration of\r\nthe form of our planet, its temperature and magnetic tension, and the\r\nfullness of organic vitality which is unfolded on its surface under the\r\naction of light.  Partial insight into the relative dependence existing\r\namong all phenomena.  Amid all the mobile and unstable elements in space,\r\n'mean numerical values' are the ultimate aim of investigation, being the\r\nexpression of the physical laws, or forces of the Cosmos.  The delineation\r\nof the universe does not begin with the earth, from which a merely\r\nsubjective point of view might have led us to start, but rather with the\r\nobjects comprised in the regions of space.  Distribution of matter, which is\r\npartially conglomerated into rotating\r\np 17\r\nand circling heavenly bodies of very different density and magnitude, and\r\npartly scattered as self-luminous vapor.

The study of these\r\nrelations leads, by a double course, to the mineral portion of geognosy (the\r\nstudy of the textures and of the position of the earth's strata), and to the\r\nconfiguration of continents and insular groups elevated above the level of\r\nthe sea (the study of the geographical form and outlines of the different\r\nparts of the earth.  Classification of rocks according to the scale of the\r\nphenomena of structure and metamorphosis, which are still passing before our\r\neyes.  Rocks of eruption, sedimentary rocks, changed (metamorphosed) rocks,\r\nconglomerates -- compound rocks are definite associations of\r\ncryctognostically simple fossils.

The knowledge of geognostic epochs -- of the upheaval of mountain chains\r\nand elevated plateaux, by which lands are both formed and destroyed, leads,\r\nby an internal causal connection, to the distribution into solids and\r\nfluids, and to the peculiarities in the natural configuration of the earth's\r\nsurface.  Existing areal relations of the solid to the fluid differ\r\nconsiderably from those presented by the maps of the physical portion of a\r\nmore ancient geography.

All\r\ngeognostic phenomena indicate a periodical alteration of activity in the\r\ninterior of our planet.  Probability of new elevations of ridges -- p.\r\n293-301 and notes.\r\n\r\ng.  The solid surface of the earth has two envelopes, one liquid, and the\r\nother aeriform.

Causes which raise or lower the temperature.\r\nRadiation of the earth's surface, according to its inclination, color,\r\ndensity, dryness, and chemical composition.  The form of the cloud which\r\nannounces what is passing in the upper strata of the atmosphere is the image\r\nof the strongly radiating ground projected on a hot summer sky.  Contrast\r\nbetween an insular or littoral climate, such as is experienced by all\r\ndeeply-articulated continents, and the climate of the interior of large\r\ntracts of land.  East and west coasts.  Difference between the southern and\r\nnorthern hemispheres.  Thermal scales of\r\np 22\r\ncultivated plants, going down from the vanilla, cacoa, and musaceae, by\r\ncitrous and olives, and to vines yielding potable wines.  The influence\r\nwhich these scales exercise on the geographical distribution of cultivated\r\nplants.  The favorable ripening and the immaturity of fruits are essentially\r\ninfluenced by the difference in the action of direct or scattered light in a\r\nclear sky or in one overcast with mist.  General summary of the causes which\r\nyield a more genial climate to the greater portion of Europe considered as\r\nthe western peninsula of Asia -- p. 326.

Undue conciseness often checks the flow of expression,\r\nwhile diffuseness is alike detrimental to a clear and precise exposition of\r\nour ideas.  Nature is a free domain, and the profound conceptions and\r\nenjoyments she awakens within us can only be vividly delineated by thought\r\nclothed in exalted forms of speech, worthy of bearing witness to the majesty\r\nand greatness of the creation.\r\n\r\nIn considering the study of physical phenomena, not merely in its bearings\r\non the material wants of life, but in its general influence on the\r\nintellectual advancement of mankind, we find its noblest and most important\r\nresult to be a knowledge of the chain of connection, by which all natural\r\nforces are linked together, and made mutually dependent upon each other; and\r\nit is the perception of these relations that exalts our views and ennobles\r\nour enjoyments.  Such a result can, however, only be reaped as the fruit of\r\nobservation and intellect, combined with the spirit of the age, in which are\r\nreflected all the varied phases of thought.  He who can trace, through\r\nby-gone times, the stream of our knowledge to its primitive source, will\r\nlearn from history how, for thousands of years, man has labored, amid the\r\never-recurring changes of form, to recognize the invariability of natural\r\nlaws, and has thus, by the force of mind, gradually subdued a great portion\r\nof the physical world to his dominion.  In interrogating the history of the\r\npast, we trace the mysterious course of ideas yielding the first glimmering\r\nperception of the same image of\r\np 24\r\na Cosmos, or harmoniously ordered whole, which, dimly shadowed forth to the\r\nhuman mind in the primitive ages of the world, is now fully revealed to the\r\nmaturer intellect of mankind as the result of long and laborious observation.\r\n\r\nEach of these epochs of the contemplation of the external world -- the\r\nearliest dawn of thought and the advanced stage of civilization -- has its\r\nown source of enjoyment.  In the former, this enjoyment, in accordance with\r\nthe simplicity of the primitive ages, flowed from an intuitive feeling of\r\nthe order that was proclaimed by the invariable and successive reappearance\r\nof the heavenly bodies, and by the progressive development of organized\r\nbeings; while in the latter, this sense of enjoyment springs from a definite\r\nknowledge of the phenomena of nature.  When man began to interrogate nature,\r\nand, not content with observing, learned to evoke phenomena under definite\r\nconditions; when once he sought to collect and record facts, in order that\r\nthe fruit of his labors might aid investigation after his own brief\r\nexistence had passed away, the 'philosophy of Nature' cast aside the vague\r\nand poetic garb in which she had been enveloped from her origin, and, having\r\nassumed a severer aspect, she now weighs the value of observations, and\r\nsubstitutes induction and reasoning for conjecture and assumption.  The\r\ndogmas of former ages survive now only in the superstitions of the people\r\nand the prejudices of the ignorant, or are perpetuated in a few systems,\r\nwhich, conscious of their weakness, shroud themselves in a vail of mystery.\r\nWe may also trace the same primitive intuitions in languages exuberant in\r\nfigurative expressions; and a few of the best chosen symbols engendered by\r\nthe happy inspiration of the earliest ages, having by degrees lost their\r\nvagueness through a better mode of interpretation, are still preserved among\r\nour scientific terms.\r\n\r\nNature considered 'rationally', that is to say, submitted to the process of\r\nthought, is a unity in diversity of phenomena; a harmony blending together\r\nall created things, however dissimilar in form and attributes; one great\r\nwhole ([Greek words]) animated by the breath of life.  The most important\r\nresult of a rational inquiry into nature is, therefore, to establish the\r\nunity and harmony of this stupendous mass of force and matter, to determine\r\nwith impartial justice what is due to the discoveries of the past and to\r\nthose of the present, and to analyze the individual parts of natural\r\nphenomena without succumbing beneath the weight of the whole.  Thus, and\r\nthus alone, is it permitted to man, while mindful of the high destiny\r\np 25\r\nof his race, to comprehend nature, to lift the vail that shrouds her\r\nphenomena, and as it were, submit the results of observation to the test of\r\nreason and of intellect.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting upon the different degrees of enjoyment presented to us in the\r\ncontemplation of nature, we find that the first place must be assigned to a\r\nsensation, which is wholly independent of an intimate acquaintance with the\r\nphysical phenomena presented to our view, or of the peculiar character of\r\nthe region surrounding us.  In the uniform plain bounded only by a distant\r\nhorizon, where the lowly heather, the cistus, or waving grasses, deck the\r\nsoil; on the ocean shore, where the waves, softly rippling over the beach,\r\nleave a track, green with the weeds of the sea; every where, the mind is\r\npenetrated by the same sense of the grandeur and vast expanse of nature,\r\nrevealing to the soul, by a mysterious inspiration, the existence of laws\r\nthat regulate the forces of the universe.  Mere communion with nature, mere\r\ncontact with the free air, exercise a soothing yet strengthening influence\r\non the wearied spirit, calm the storm of passion, and soften the heart when\r\nshaken by sorrow to its inmost depths.  Every where, in every region of the\r\nglobe, in every stage of intellectual culture, the same sources of enjoyment\r\nare alike vouchsafed to man.  The earnest and solemn thoughts awakened by a\r\ncommunion with nature intuitively arise from a presentiment of the order and\r\nharmony pervading the whole universe, and from the contrast we draw between\r\nthe narrow limits of our own existence and the image of infinity revealed on\r\nevery side, whether we look upward to the starry vault of heaven, scan the\r\nfar-stretching plain before us, or seek to trace the dim horizon across the\r\nvast expanse of ocean.\r\n\r\nThe contemplation of the individual characteristics of the landscape, and of\r\nthe conformation of the land in any definite region of the earth, gives rise\r\nto a different source of enjoyment, awakening impressions that are more\r\nvivid, better defined, and more congenial to certain phases of the mind,\r\nthan those of which we have already spoken.  At one time the heart is\r\nstirred by a sense of the grandeur of the face of nature, by the strife of\r\nthe elements, or, as in Northern Asia by the aspect of the dreary barrenness\r\nof the far-stretching steppes; at another time, softer emotions are excited\r\nby the contemplation of rich harvests wrested by the hand of man from the\r\nwild fertility of nature, or by the sight of human habitations raised beside\r\nsome wild and foaming torrent.  Here I regard less the degree of intensity\r\nthan the difference existing in the\r\np 26\r\nvarious sensations that derive their charm and permanence from the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the scene.\r\n\r\nIf I might be allowed to abandon myself to the recollections of my own\r\ndistant travels, I would instance, among the most striking scenes of nature,\r\nthe calm sublimity of a tropical night, when the stars, not sparkling, as in\r\nour northern skies, shed their soft and planetary light over the\r\ngently-heaving ocean; or I would recall the deep valleys of the Cordilleras,\r\nwhere the tall and slender palms pierce the leafy vail around them, and\r\nwaving on high their feathery and arrow-like branches for, as it were, \"a\r\nforest above a forest;\"* or I would describe the summit of the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, when a horizontal layer of clouds, dazzling in whiteness, has\r\nseparated the cone of cinders from the plain below, and suddenly the\r\nascending current pierces the cloudy vail, so that the eye of the traveler\r\nmay range from the brink of the crater, along the vine-clad slopes of\r\nOrotava, to the orange gardens and banana groves that skirt the shore.  In\r\nscenes like these, it is not the peaceful charm uniformly spread over the\r\nface of nature that moves the heart, but rather the peculiar physiognomy and\r\nconformation of the land, the features of the landscape, the ever varying\r\noutline of the clouds, and their blending with the horizon of the sea,\r\nwhether it lies spread before us like a smooth and shining mirror, or is\r\ndimly seen through the morning mist.  All that the senses can but\r\nimperfectly comprehend, all that is most awful in such romantic scenes of\r\nnature, may become a source of enjoyment to man, by opening a wide field to\r\nthe creative powers of his imagination.  Impressions change with the varying\r\nmovements of the mind, and we are led by a happy illusion to believe that we\r\nreceive from the external world that with which we have ourselves invested\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *This expression is taken from a beautiful description of\r\ntropical forest scenery in 'Paul and Virginia', by Bernardia de Saint Pierre.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen far from our native country, after a long voyage, we tread for the\r\nfirst time the soil of a tropical land, we experience a certain feeling of\r\nsurprise and gratification in recognizing, in the rocks that surround us,\r\nthe same inclined schistose strata, and the same columnar basalt covered\r\nwith cellular amygdaloids, that we had left in Europe, and whose identity of\r\ncharacter, in latitudes so widely different, reminds us that the\r\nsolidification of the earth's crust is altogether independent of climatic\r\ninfluences.  But these rocky masses of schist and of basalt are covered with\r\nvegetation of a character with which we are unacquainted, and of a\r\nphysiognomy wholly\r\np 27\r\nunknown to us; and it is then, amid the colossal and majestic forms of an\r\nexotic flora, that we feel how wonderfully the flexibility of our nature\r\nfits us to receive new impressions, linked together by a certain secret\r\nanalogy.  We so readily perceive the affinity existing among all the forms\r\nof organic life, that although the sight of a vegetation similar to that of\r\nour native country might at first be most welcome to the eye, as the sweet\r\nfamiliar sounds of our mother tongue are to the ear, we nevertheless, by\r\ndegrees, and almost imperceptibly, become familiarized with a new home and a\r\nnew climate.  As a true citizen of the world, man every where habituates\r\nhimself to that which surrounds him; yet fearful, as it were, of breaking\r\nthe links of association that bind him to the home of his childhood, the\r\ncolonist applies to some few plants in a far-distant clime the names he had\r\nbeen familiar with in his native land; and by the mysterious relations\r\nexisting among all types of organization, the forms of exotic vegetation\r\npresent themselves to his mind as nobler and more perfect developments of\r\nthose he had loved in earlier days.  Thus do the spontaneous impressions of\r\nthe untutored mind lead, like the laborious deductions of cultivated\r\nintellect, to the same intimate persuasion, that one sole and indissoluble\r\nchain binds together all nature.\r\n\r\nIt may seem a rash attempt to endeavor to separate, into its different\r\nelements, the magic power exercised upon our minds by the physical world,\r\nsince the character of the landscape, and of every imposing scene in nature,\r\ndepends so materially upon the mutual relation of the ideas and sentiments\r\nsimultaneously excited in the mind of the observer.\r\n\r\nThe powerful effect exercised by nature springs, as it were, from the\r\nconnection and unity of the impressions and emotions produced; and we can\r\nonly trace their different sources by analyzing the individuality of objects\r\nand the diversity of forces.\r\n\r\nThe richest and most varied elements for pursuing an analysis of this nature\r\npresent themselves to the eyes of the traveler in the scenery of Southern\r\nAsia, in the Great Indian Archipelago, and more especially, too, in the New\r\nContinent, where the summits of the lofty Cordilleras penetrate the confines\r\nof the aerial ocean surrounding our globe, and where the same subterranean\r\nforces that once raised these mountain chains still shake them to their\r\nfoundation and threaten their downfall.\r\n\r\nGraphic delineations of nature, arranged according to systematic views, are\r\nnot only suited to please the imagination,\r\np 28\r\nbut may also, when properly considered, indicate the grades of the\r\nimpressions of which I have spoken, from the uniformity of the sea-shore, or\r\nthe barren steppes of Siberia, to the inexhaustible fertility of the torrid\r\nzone.  If we were even to picture to ourselves Mount Pilatus placed on the\r\nSchreckhorn,* or the Schneekoppe of Silesia on Mont Blanc, we should\r\np 29\r\nnot have attained to the height of that great Colossus of the Andes, the\r\nChimborazo, whose height is twice that of Mont Aetna; and we must pile the\r\nRighi, or Mount Athos, on the summit of the Chimborazo, in order to form a\r\njust estimate of the elevation of the Dhawalagiri, the highest point of the\r\nHimalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *These comparisons are only approximative.  The several\r\nelevations above the level of the sea are, in accurate numbers, as follows:\r\nThe Schneekoppe or Riesenkoppe, in Silesia about 5270 feet, according to\r\nHallaschka.  The Righi, 5902 feet, taking the height of the Lake of Lucerne\r\nat 1426 feet, according to Eschman.  (See 'Compte Rendu des Mesures\r\nTrigonometriques en Suisse', 1840, p. 230.)  Mount Athos, 6775 feet,\r\naccording to Captain Gaultier; Mount Pilatus, 7546 feet; Mount Aetna, 10,871\r\nfeet, according to Captain Smyth; or 10,874 feet, according to the\r\nbarometrical measurement made by Sir John Herschel, and communicated to me\r\nin writing in 1825, and 10,899 feet, according to angles of altitude taken\r\nby Cacciatore at Palermo (calculated by assuming the terrestrial refraction\r\nto be 0.076); the Schreckhorn, 12,383 feet; the Jungfrau, 13,720 feet,\r\naccording to Tralles; Mount Blanc, 15,775 feet, according to the different\r\nmeasurements considered by Roger ('Bibl. Univ.', May, 1828, 0. 24-53),\r\n15,733 feet, according to the measurements taken from Mount Columbier by\r\nCarlini in 1821, and 15,748 feet, as measured by the Austrian engineers from\r\nTrelod and the Glacier d'Ambin.\r\n\r\n[footnote continued]\r\nThe actual height of the Swiss mountains fluctuates, according to Eschman's\r\nobservations, as much as 25 English feet, owing to the varying thickness of\r\nthe stratum of snow that covers the summits.  Chimborazo is, according to my\r\ntrigonometrical measurements, 21,421 feet (see Humboldt, 'Recueil d'Obs.\r\nAstr.', tome i., p. 73), and Dhawalagiri, 28,074 feet.  As there is a\r\ndifference of 445 feet between the determinations of Blake and Webb, the\r\nelevation assigned to the Dhawalagiri (or white mountain, from the Sanscrit\r\n'dhawala', white, and 'giri', mountain) can not be received with the same\r\nconfidence as that of the Jawahir, 25,749 feet, since the latter rests on a\r\ncomplete trigonomietrical measurement (see Herbert and Hodgson in the\r\n'Asiat. Res.', vol. xiv., p. 189, and Suppl. to 'Encycl. Brit.', vol. iv.,\r\np. 643).  I have shown elsewhere ('Ann. des Sciences Naturelles', Mars,\r\n1825) that the height of the Dhawalagiri (28,074 feet) depends on several\r\nelements that have not been ascertained with certainty, as azimuths and\r\nlatitudes (Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 282).  It has been\r\nbelieved, but without foundation, that in the Tartaric chain, north of\r\nThibet, opposite to the chain of Kuen-lun, there are several snowy summits,\r\nwhose elevation is about 30,000 English feet (almost twice that of Mont\r\nBlanc), or, at any rate, 29,000 feet (see Captain Alexander Gerard's and\r\nJohn Gerard's 'Journey to the Boorendo Pass', 1840, vol. i., p. 143 and\r\n311).  Chimborazo is spoken of in the text only as 'one' of the highest\r\nsummits of the chain of the Andes; for in the year 1827, the learned and\r\nhighly-gifted traveler, Pentland, in his memorable expedition to Upper Peru\r\n(Bolivia), measured the elevation of two mountains situated to the east of\r\nLake Titicaca, viz., the Sorata, 25,200 feet, and the Illimani, 24,000 feet,\r\nboth greatly exceeding the height of Chimborazo, which is only 21,421 feet,\r\nand being nearly equal in elevation to the Jawahir, which is the highest\r\nmountain in the Himalaya that has as yet been accurately measured.  Thus\r\nMont Blanc is 5646 feet below Chimborazo; Chimborazo, 3779 feet below the\r\nSorata; the Sorata, 549 feet below the Jawahir, and probably about 2880 feet\r\nbelow the Dhawalagiri.  According to a new measurement of the Illimani, by\r\nPentland, in 1838, the elevation of this mountain is given at 23,868 feet,\r\nvarying only 133 feet from the measurement taken in 1827.  The elevations\r\nhave been given in this note with minute exactness, as erroneous numbers\r\nhave been introduced into many maps and tables recently published, owing to\r\nincorrect reductions of the measurements.\r\n[In the preceding note, taken from those appended to the Introduction in the\r\nFrench translation, rewritten by Humboldt himself, the measurements are\r\ngiven in meters, but these have been converted into English feet, for the\r\ngreater convenience of the general reader.] -- 'Tr.'\r\n\r\n\r\nBut although the mountains of India greatly surpass the Cordilleras of South\r\nAmerica by their astonishing elevation (which, after being long contested,\r\nhas at last been confirmed by accurate measurements), they can not, from\r\ntheir geographical position, present the same inexhaustible variety of\r\nphenomena by which the latter are characterized.  The impression produced by\r\nthe grander aspects of nature dies not depend exclusively on height.  The\r\nchain of the Himalaya is placed far beyond the limits of the torrid zone,\r\nand scarcely is a solitary palm-tree to be found in the beautiful valleys of\r\nKumaoun and Garhwal.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote] *The absence of palms and tree-ferns on the temperate slopes of\r\nthe Himalaya is shown in Don's 'Flora Nepalensis', 1825, and in the\r\nremarkable series of lithographs of Wallich's 'Flora Indica', whose\r\ncatalogue contains the enormous number of 7683 Himalaya species, almost all\r\nphanerogamic plants, which have as yet been but imperfectly classified.  In\r\nNepaul (lat. 26 1/2 degrees to 27 1/4 degrees) there has hitherto been\r\nobserved only one species of palm, Chamaerops martiana, Wall. ('Plantae\r\nAsiat.', lib. iii., p. 5,211), which is found at the height of 5250 English\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, in the shady valley of Bunipa.  The\r\nmagnificent tree-fern, Alsophila brunoniana, Wall. (of which a stem 48 feet\r\nlong has been in the possession of the British Museum since 1831), does not\r\ngrow in Nepaul, but is found on the mountains of Silhet, to the northwest of\r\nCalcutta, in lat. 24 degrees 50 minutes.  The Nepaul fern, Paranema\r\ncyathoides, Don, formerly known as Sphaeroptera barbata, Wall. ('Plantae\r\nAsiat.', lib. i., p. 42, 48), is indeed, nearly related to Cyathea, a\r\nspecies of which I have seen in the South American Missions of Caripe,\r\nmeasuring 33 feet in height; this is not, however, properly speaking a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the southern slope of the ancient Paropamisus, in the latitudes of 28\r\ndegrees and 34 degrees, nature no longer displays the same abundance of\r\ntree-ferns and arborescent grasses, heliconias and orchideous plants, which\r\nin tropical\r\np 30\r\nregions are to be found even on the highest plateaux of the mountains.  On\r\nthe slope of the Himalaya, under the shade of the Deodora and the\r\nbroad-leaved oak, peculiar to these Indian Alps, the rocks of granite and of\r\nmica schist are covered with vegetable forms almost similar to those which\r\ncharacterize Europe and Northern Asia.  The species are not identical, but\r\nclosely analogous in aspect and physiognomy, as, marsh parnassia, and the\r\nprickly species of Ribes.*  The chain of the Himalaya is also wanting in the\r\nimposing phenomena of volcanoes, which in the Andes and in the Indian\r\nArchipelago often reveal to the inhabitants, under the most terrific forms,\r\nthe existence of the forces pervading the interior of our planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Ribes nubicola, R. glaciale, R. grossularia.  The species which\r\ncompose the vegetation of the Himalaya are four pines, notwithstanding the\r\nassertion of the ancients regarding Eastern Asia (Strabo, lib. 11, p. 510,\r\nCas.), twenty-five oaks, four birches, two chestnuts, seven maples, twelve\r\nwillows, fourteen roses, three species of strawberry, seven species of\r\nAlpine roses ('rhododendra'), one of which attains a height of 20 feet, and\r\nmany other northern genera.  Large white apes, having black faces, inhabit\r\nthe wild chestnut-tree of Kashmir, which grows to a height of 100 feet, in\r\nlat. 33 degrees (see Carl von Hugel's 'Kaschmir', 1840, 2d pt. 249).  Among\r\nthe Coniferae, we find the Pinus deodwara, or deodara (in Sanscrit,\r\n'dewa-daru', the timber of the gods), which is nearly allied to Pinus\r\ncedrus.  Near the limit of perpetual snow flourish the large and showy\r\nflowers of the Gentiana venusta, G. Moorcroftiana, Swertia purpurescens, S.\r\nspeciosa, Parnassia armata, P. nubicola, Poenia Emode, Tulipa stellata; and\r\nbesides varieties of European genera peculiar to these Indian mountains,\r\ntrue European species as Leontodon taraxacum, Prunella vulgaris, Galium\r\naparine, and Thlaspi arvense.  The heath mentioned by Saunders, in Turner's\r\n'Travels', and which had been confounded with Calluna vulgaris, is an\r\nAndromeda, a fact of the greatest importance in the geography of Asiatic\r\nplants.  If I have made use, in this work, of the unphilosophical\r\nexpressions of European genera, 'European' special, 'growing wild in Asia',\r\netc., it has been in consequence of the old botanical language, which,\r\ninstead of the idea of a large dissemination, or, rather, of the coexistence\r\nof organic productions, has dogmatically substituted the false hypothesis of\r\na migration, which, from predilection for Europe, is further assumed to have\r\nbeen from west to east.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, on the southern declivity of the Himalaya, where the ascending\r\ncurrent deposits the exhalations rising from a vigorous Indian vegetation,\r\nthe region of perpetual snow begins at an elevation of 11,000 or 12,000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea,* thus setting a limit to the development of\r\norganic\r\np 31\r\nlife in a zone that is nearly 3000 feet lower than that to which it attains\r\nin the equinoctial region of the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *On the southern declivity of the Himalaya, the limit of\r\nperpetual snow is 12,978 feet above the level of the sea; on the northern\r\ndeclivity, or, rather, on the peaks which rise above the Thibet, or\r\nTartarian plateau, this limit is at 16,625 feet from 30 1/2 degrees to 32\r\ndegrees of latitude, while at the equator, in the Andes of Quito, it is\r\n15,790 feet.  Such is the result I have deduced from the combination of\r\nnumerous data furnished by Webb, Gerard, Herbert, and Moorcroft.  (See my\r\ntwo memoirs on the mountains of India, in 1816 and 1820, in the 'Ann. de\r\nChimie et de Physique', t. iii., p. 303; t. xiv., p. 6, 22, 50.)  The\r\ngreater elevation to which the limit of perpetual snow recedes on the\r\nTartarian declivity is owing to the radiation of heat from the neighboring\r\nelevated plains, to the purity of the atmosphere, and to the infrequent\r\nformation of snow in an air which is both very cold and very dry.\r\n(Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 281-326.)  My opinion on the\r\ndifference of height of the snow-line on the two sides of the Himalaya has\r\nthe high authority of Colebrooke in its favor.  He wrote to me in June,\r\n1824, as follows:  \"I also find, from the data in my possession, that the\r\nelevation of the line of perpetual snow is 13,000 feet.  On the southern\r\ndeclivity, and at latitude 31 degrees, Webb's measurements give me 13,500\r\nfeet, consequently 500 feet more than the height deduced from Captain\r\nHodgson's observations.  Gerard's measurements fully confirm your opinion\r\nthat the line of snow is higher on the northern than on the southern side.\"\r\nIt was not until the present year (1840) that we obtained the complete and\r\ncollected journal of the brothers Gerard, published under the supervision of\r\nMr. Lloyd.  ('Narrative of a Journey from Cawnpoor to the Boorendo Pass, in\r\nthe Himalaya, by Captain Alexander Gerard and John Gerard, edited by George\r\nLloyd', vol. i., p. 292, 311, 320, 327 and 341.)  Many interesting details\r\nregarding some localities may be found in the narrative of 'A Visit to the\r\nShatool, for the Purpose of determining the Line of Perpetual Snow on the\r\nsouthern face of the Himalaya, in August', 1822.  Unfortunately, however,\r\nthese travelers always confound the elevation at which sporadic snow falls\r\nwith the maximum of the height that the snow-line attains on the Thibetian\r\nplateau.  Captain Gerard distinguishes between the summits that rise in the\r\nmiddle of the plateau, where he states the elevation of the snow-line to be\r\nbetween 18,000 and 19,000 feet, and the northern slopes of the chain of the\r\nHimalaya, which border on the defile of the Sutledge, and can radiate but\r\nlittle heat, owing to the deep ravines with which they are intersected.  The\r\nelevation of the village of Tangno is given at only 9300 feet, while that of\r\nthe plateau surrounding the sacred lake of Maqasa is 17,000 feet.  Captain\r\nGerard finds the snow-line 500 feet lower on the northern slopes, where the\r\nchain of the Himalaya is broken through, than toward the southern\r\ndeclivities facing Hindostan, and he there estimates the line of perpetual\r\nsnow at 15,000 feet.  The most striking differences are presented between\r\nthe vegetation on the Thibetian plateau and that characteristic of the\r\nsouthern slopes of the Himalaya.  On the latter the cultivation of grain is\r\narrested at 9974 feet and even there the corn has often to be cut when the\r\nblades are still green.  The extreme limit of forests of tall oaks and\r\ndeodars is 11,960 feet; that of dwarf birches, 12,983 feet.  On the plains,\r\nCaptain Gerard found pastures up to the height of 17,000 feet; the cereals\r\nwill grow at 14,100 feet, or even at 18,540 feet; birches with tall stems at\r\n14,100 feet, and copse or brush wood applicable for fuel is found at an\r\nelevation of upward of 17,000 feet, that is to say, 1280 feet and above the\r\nlower limits of the snow-line at the equator, in the province of Quito.  It\r\nis very desirable that the 'mean' elevation of the Thibetian plateau, which\r\nI have estimated at only about 8200 feet between the Himalaya and the\r\nKuen-lun, and the difference in the height of the line of perpetual snow on\r\nthe southern and on the northern slopes of the Himalaya, should be again\r\ninvestigated by travelers who are accustomed to judge of the general\r\nconformation of the land.  Hitherto simple calculations have too often been\r\nconfounded with actual measurements, and the elevations of isolated summits\r\nwith that of the surrounding plateau.  (Compare Carl Zimmerman's excellent\r\nHypsometrical Remarks in his 'Geographischen Analyse der Karte von Inner\r\nAsien', 1841, s. 98.)  Lord draws attention to the difference presented by\r\nthe two faces of the Himalaya and those of the Alpine chain of Hindoo-Coosh,\r\nwith respect to the limits of the snow-line.  \"The latter chain,\" he says,\r\n\"has the table-land to the south, in consequence of which the snow-line is\r\nhigher on the southern side, contrary to what we find to be the case with\r\nrespect to the Himalaya, which is bounded on the south by sheltered plains,\r\nas Hindoo-Coosh is on the north.\"  It must, however, be admitted that the\r\nhypsometrical data on which these statements are based require a critical\r\nrevision with regard to several of their details; but still they suffice to\r\nestablish the main fact, that the remarkable configuration of the land in\r\nCentral Asia affords man all that is essential to the maintenance of life,\r\nas habitation, food, and fuel, at an elevation above the level of the sea\r\nwhich in almost all other parts of the globe is covered with perpetual ice.\r\nWe must except the very dry districts of Bolivia, where snow is so rarely\r\nmet with, and where Pentland (in 1838) fixed the snow-line at 15,667 feet,\r\nbetween 16 degrees and 17 3/4 degrees south latitude.  The opinion that I\r\nhad advanced regarding the difference in the snow-line on the two faces of\r\nthe Himalaya has been most fully confirmed by the barometrical observations\r\nof Victor Jacquemont, who fell an early sacrifice to his noble and unwearied\r\nardor.  (See his 'Correspondance pendant son Voyage dans l'Inde', 1828 'a'\r\n1832, liv. 23, p. 290, 296, 299.)  \"Perpetual snow,\" says Jacquemont,\r\n\"descends lower on the southern than on the northern slopes of the Himalaya,\r\nand the limit constantly rises as we advance to the north of the chain\r\nbordering on India.  On the Kionbrong, about 18,317 feet in elevation,\r\naccording to Captain Gerard, I was still considerably below the limit of\r\nperpetual snow which I believe to be 19,690 feet in this part of Hindostan.\"\r\n (This estimate I consider much too high.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote continues]  The same traveler says, \"To whatever height we rise on\r\nthe southern declivity of the Himalaya, the climate retains the same\r\ncharacter, and the same division of the seasons as in the plains of India;\r\nthe summer solstice being every year marked by the same prevalence of rain\r\nwhich continues to fall without intermission until the autumnal equinox.\r\nBut a new, a totally different climate begins at Kashmir, whose elevation I\r\nestimate to be 5350 feet, nearly equal to that of the cities of Mexico and\r\nPopayan\" ('Correspond. de Jacquemont', t. ii., p. 58 et 74).  The warm and\r\nhumid air of the sea, as Leopold von Buch well observes, is carried by the\r\nmonsoons across the plains of India to the skirts of the Himalaya which\r\narrest its course, and hinder it from diverging to the Thibetian districts\r\nof Ladak and Lassa.  Carl von Hugel estimates the elevation of the Valley of\r\nKashmir above the level of the sea at 5818 feet, and bases his observation\r\non the determination of the boiling point of water (see theil 11, s. 155,\r\nand 'Journal of Geog. Soc.', vol. vi., p. 215).  In this valley, where the\r\natmosphere is scarcely ever agitated by storms, and in 34 degrees 7 minutes\r\nlat., snow is found, several feet in thickness, from December to March.\r\n\r\np 32\r\nBut the countries bordering on the equator possess another advantage, to\r\nwhich sufficient attention has not hitherto been\r\np 33\r\ndirected.  This portion of the surface of the globe affords in the smallest\r\nspace the greatest possible variety of impressions from the contemplation of\r\nnature.  Among the colossal mountains of Cundinamarea, of Quito, and of\r\nPeru, furrowed by deep ravines, man is enabled to contemplate alike all the\r\nfamilies of plants, and all the stars of the firmament.  There, at a single\r\nglance, the eye surveys majestic palms, humid forests of bambusa, and the\r\nvaried species of Musaceae, while above these forms of tropical vegetation\r\nappear oaks, medlars, the sweet-brier, and umbelliferous plants, as in our\r\nEuropean homes.  There as the traveler turns his eyes to the vault of\r\nheaven, a single glance embraces the constellation of the Southern Cross,\r\nthe Magellanic clouds, and the guiding stars of the constellation of the\r\nBear, as they circle round the arctic pole.  There the depths of the earth\r\nand the vaults of heaven display all the richness of their forms and the\r\nvariety of their phenomena.  There the different climates are ranged the one\r\nabove the other, stage by stage, like the vegetable zones, whose succession\r\nthey limit; and there the observer may readily trace the laws that regulate\r\nthe diminution of heat, as they stand indelibly inscribed on the rocky walls\r\nand abrupt declivities of the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nNot to weary the reader with the details of the phenomena which I long since\r\nendeavored graphically to represent,* I will here limit myself to the\r\nconsideration of a few of the general results whose combination constitutes\r\nthe 'physical delineation of the torrid zone.'  That which, in the vagueness\r\nof our\r\np 34\r\nimpressions, loses all distinctness of form, like some distant mountain\r\nshrouded from view by a vail of mist, is clearly revealed by the light of\r\nmind, which, by its scrutiny into the causes of phenomena, learns to resolve\r\nand analyze their different elements, assigning to each its individual\r\ncharacter.  Thus, in the sphere of natural investigation, as in poetry and\r\npainting, the delineation of that which appeals most strongly to the\r\nimagination, derives its collective interest from the vivid truthfulness\r\nwith which the individual features are portrayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See, generally my 'Essai sur la Geographie des Plantes, et le\r\nTableau physique des Regions Equinoxiales', 1807, p. 80-88.  On the diurnal\r\nand nocturnal variations of temperature, see Plate 9 of my 'Atlas Geogr. et\r\nPhys. du Nouveau Continent'; and the Tables in my work, entitled 'De\r\ndistributione Geographica Plantarum, secundum coeli tempriem, et altitudinem\r\nMontium', 1817, p. 90-116; the meteorological portion of my 'Asie Centrale',\r\nt. iii., p. 212, 224; and, finally, the more recent and far more exact\r\nexposition of the variations of temperature experienced in correspondence\r\nwith the increase of altitude on the chain of the Andes, given in\r\nBoussingault's Memoir, 'Sur la profondeur a laquelle on trouve, sous les\r\nTropiques, la couche de Temperature Invariable.'  (Ann. de Chimie et de\r\nPhysique, 1833, t. liii., p. 225-247.)  This treatise contains the\r\nelevations of 128 points, included between the level of the sea and the\r\ndeclivity of the Antisana (17,900 feet), as well as the mean temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere, which varies with the height between 81 degrees and 35\r\ndegrees F.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regions of the torrid zone not only give rise to the most powerful\r\nimpressions by their organic richness and their abundant fertility, but they\r\nlikewise afford the inestimable advantage of revealing to man, by the\r\nuniformity of the variations of the atmosphere and the development of vital\r\nforces, and by the contrasts of climate and vegetation exhibited at the\r\ndifferent elevations, the invariability of the laws that regulate the course\r\nof the heavenly bodies, reflected, as it were, in terrestrial phenomena.\r\nLet us dwell, then, for a few moments, on the proofs of this regularity,\r\nwhich is such that it may be submitted to numerical calculation and\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nIn the burning plains that rise but little above the level of the sea, reign\r\nthe families of the banana, the cycas, and the palm, of which the number of\r\nspecies comprised in the flora of tropical regions has been so wonderfully\r\nincreased in the present day by the zeal of botanical travelers.  To these\r\ngroups succeed, in the Alpine valleys, and the humid and shaded clefts on\r\nthe slopes of the Cordilleras, the tree-ferns, whose thick cylindrical\r\ntrunks and delicate lace-like foliage stand out in bold relief against the\r\nazure of the sky, and the cinchona, from which we derive the febrifuge bark.\r\n The medicinal strength of this bark is said to increase in proportion to\r\nthe degree of moisture imparted to the foliage of the tree by the light\r\nmists which form the upper surface of the clouds resting over the plains.\r\nEvery where around, the confines of the forest are encircled by broad bands\r\nof social plants, as the delicate aralia, the thibaudia, and the\r\nmyrtle-leaved Andromeda, while the Alpine rose, the magnificent befaria,\r\nweaves a purple girdle round the spiry peaks.  In the cold regions of the\r\nParamos, which is continually exposed to the fury of storms and winds, we\r\nfind that flowering shrubs and herbaceous plants, bearing large and\r\nvariegated blossoms, have given place to monocotyledons, whose slender\r\nspikes constitute the sole covering of the soil.  This is the zone of the\r\np 35\r\ngrasses, one vast savannah extending over the immense mountain plateaux, and\r\nreflecting a yellow, almost golden tinge, to the slopes of the Cordilleras,\r\non which graze the lama and the cattle domesticated by the European\r\ncolonist.  Where the naked trachyte rock pierces the grassy turf, and\r\npenetrates into those higher strata of air which are supposed to be less\r\ncharged with carbonic acid, we meet only with plants of an inferior\r\norganization, as lichens, lecideas, and the brightly-colored, dust-like\r\nlepraria, scattered around in circular patches.  Islets of fresh-fallen\r\nsnow, varying in form and extent, arrest the last feeble traces of vegetable\r\ndevelopment, and to these succeeds the region of perpetual snow, whose\r\nelevation undergoes but little change, and may be easily determined.  It is\r\nbut rarely that the elastic forces at work within the interior of our globe\r\nhave succeeded in breaking through the spiral domes, which, resplendent in\r\nthe brightness of eternal snow, crown the summits of the Cordilleras; and\r\neven where these subterranean forces have opened a permanent communication\r\nwith the atmosphere, through circular craters or long fissures, they rarely\r\nsend forth currents of lava, but merely eject ignited scoriae, steam,\r\nsulphureted hydrogen gas, and jets of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stages of civilization, the grand and imposing spectacle\r\npresented to the minds of the inhabitants of the tropics could only awaken\r\nfeelings of astonishment and awe.  It might, perhaps, be supposed, as we\r\nhave already said, that the periodical return of the same phenomena, and the\r\nuniform manner in which they arrange themselves in successive groups, would\r\nhave enabled man more readily to attain to a knowledge of the laws of\r\nnature; but, as far as tradition and history guide us, we do not find that\r\nany application was made of the advantages presented by these favored\r\nregions.  Recent researches have rendered it very doubtful whether the\r\nprimitive seat of Hindoo civilization -- one of the most remarkable phases\r\nin the progress of mankind -- was actually within the tropics.  Airyana\r\nVaedjo, the ancient cradle of the Zend, was situated to the northwest of the\r\nupper Indus, and after the great religious schism, that is to say, after the\r\nseparation of the Iranians from the Brahminical institution, the language\r\nthat had previously been common to them and to the Hindoos assumed among the\r\nlatter people (together with the literature, habits, and conditions of\r\nsociety) an individual form in the Magodha of Madhya Desa,* a district that\r\nis bounded by the great chain\r\np 36\r\nof Himalaya and the smaller range of the Vindhya.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *See, on the Madhjadeca, properly so called, Lassen's excellent\r\nwork, entitled 'Indische Alterthumskunde', bd. i., s. 92.  The Chinese give\r\nthe name of Mo-kie-thi to the southern Bahar, situated to the south of the\r\nGanges (see 'Foe-Koue-Ki' by, 'Chy-Fa-Hian', 1836, p. 256).  Djambu-dwipa is\r\nthe name given to the whole of India; but the words also indicate one of the\r\nfour Buddhist continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn less ancient times the Sanscrit language and civilization advanced toward\r\nthe southeast, penetrating further within the torrid zone, as my brother\r\nWilhelm von Humboldt has shown in his great work on the Kavi and other\r\nlanguages of analogous structure.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote] *'Ueber die Kawi Sprache auf der Insel Java, nebst einer\r\nEinleitung uber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren\r\nEin fluss auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengrshlecht's' von Wilhelm\r\nv. Humboldt, 1836, bd. i., s. 50519.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the obstacles opposed in northern latitudes to the discovery\r\nof the laws of nature, owing to the excessive complication of phenomena, and\r\nthe perpetual local variations and the distribution of organic forms, it is\r\nto the inhabitants of a small section of the temperate zone that the rest of\r\nmankind owe the earliest revelation of an intimate and rational acquaintance\r\nwith the forces governing the physical world.  Moreover, it is from the same\r\nzone (which is apparently more favorable to the progress of reason, the\r\nsoftening of manners, and the security of public liberty) that the germs of\r\ncivilization have been carried to the regions of the tropics, as much by the\r\nmigratory movement of races as by the establishment of colonies, differing\r\nwidely in their institution from those of the Phoenicians or Greeks.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the influence exercised by the succession of phenomena on the\r\ngreater or lesser facility of recognizing the causes producing them, I have\r\ntouched upon that important stage of our communion with the external world,\r\nwhen the enjoyment arising from a knowledge of the laws, and the mutual\r\nconnection of phenomena, associates itself with the charm of a simple\r\ncontemplation of nature.  That which for a long time remains merely an\r\nobject of vague intuition, by degrees acquires the certainty of positive\r\ntruth; and man, as an immortal poet has said, in our own tongue -- Amid\r\nceaseless change seeks the unchanging pole.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *This verse occurs in a poem of Schiller, entitled 'Der\r\nSpaziergang' which first appeared in 1795, in the 'Horen.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to trace to its primitive source the enjoyment derived from the\r\nexercise of thought, it is sufficient to cast a rapid glance on the earliest\r\ndawnings of the philosophy of nature, or of the ancient doctrine of the\r\n'Cosmos.'  We find even\r\np 37\r\namong the most savage nations (as my own travels enable me to attest) a\r\ncertain vague, terror-stricken sense of the all-powerful unity of natural\r\nforces, and of the existence of an invisible, spiritual essence manifested\r\nin these forces, whether in unfolding the flower and maturing the fruit of\r\nthe nutrient tree, in upheaving the soil of the forest, or in rending the\r\nclouds with the might of the storm.  We may here trace the revelation of a\r\nbond of union, linking together the visible world and that higher spiritual\r\nworld which escapes the grasp of the senses.  The two become unconsciously\r\nblended together, developing in the mind of man, as a simple product of\r\nideal conception and independently of the aid of observation, the first germ\r\nof a 'Philosophy of Nature.'\r\n\r\nAmong nations least advanced in civilization, the imagination revels in\r\nstrange and fantastic creations, and, by its predilection for symbols, alike\r\ninfluences ideas and language.  Instead of examining, men are led to\r\nconjecture, dogmatize, and interpret supposed facts that have never been\r\nobserved.  The inner world of thought and of feeling does not reflect the\r\nimage of the external world in its primitive purity.  That which in some\r\nregions of the earth manifested itself as the rudiments of natural\r\nphilosophy, only to a small number of persons endowed with superior\r\nintelligence, appears in other regions, and among entire races of men, to be\r\nthe result of mystic tendencies and instinctive intuitions.  An intimate\r\ncommunion with nature, and the vivid and deep emotions thus awakened, are\r\nlikewise the source from which have sprung the first impulses toward the\r\nworship and deification of the destroying and preserving forces of the\r\nuniverse.  But by degrees, as man, after having passed through the different\r\ngradations of intellectual development, arrives at the free enjoyment of the\r\nregulating power of reflection, and learns by gradual progress, as it were,\r\nto separate the world of ideas from that of sensations, he no longer rests\r\nsatisfied merely with a vague presentiment of the harmonious unity of\r\nnatural forces; thought begins to fulfill its noble mission; and\r\nobservation, aided by reason, endeavors to trace phenomena to the causes\r\nfrom which they spring.\r\n\r\nThe history of science teaches us the difficulties that have opposed the\r\nprogress of this active spirit of inquiry.  Inaccurate and imperfect\r\nobservations have led, by false inductions, to the great number of physical\r\nviews that have been perpetuated as popular prejudices among all classes of\r\nsociety.  Thus by the side of a solid and scientific knowledge of natural\r\nphenomena there has been preserved a system of the pretended\r\np 38\r\nresults of observation, which is so much the more difficult to shake, as it\r\ndenies the validity of the facts by which it may be refuted.  This\r\nempiricism, the melancholy heritage transmitted to us from former times,\r\ninvariably contends for the truth of its axioms with the arrogance of a\r\nnarrow-minded spirit.  Physical philosophy, on the other hand, when based\r\nupon science, doubts because it seeks to investigate, distinguishes between\r\nthat which is certain and that which is merely probable, and strives\r\nincessantly to perfect theory by extending the circle of observation.\r\n\r\nThis assemblage of imperfect dogmas, bequeathed by one age to another --\r\nthis physical philosophy, which is composed of popular prejudices -- is not\r\nonly injurious because it perpetuates error with the obstinacy engendered by\r\nthe evidence of ill-observed facts, but also because it hinders the mind\r\nfrom attaining to higher views of nature.  Instead of seeking to discover\r\nthe 'mean'  or 'medium' point, around which oscillate, in apparent\r\nindependence of forces, all the phenomena of the external world, this system\r\ndelights in multiplying exceptions to the law, and seeks, amid phenomena and\r\nin organic forms for something beyond the marvel of a regular succession,\r\nand an internal and progressive development.  Ever inclined to believe that\r\nthe order of nature is disturbed, it refuses to recognize in the present any\r\nanalogy with the past, and guided by its own varying hypotheses, seeks at\r\nhazard, either in the interior of the globe or in the regions of space, for\r\nthe cause of these pretended perturbations.\r\n\r\nIt is the special object of the present work to combat those errors which\r\nderive their source from a vicious empiricism and from imperfect inductions.\r\n The higher enjoyments yielded by the study of nature depend upon the\r\ncorrectness and the depth of our views, and upon the extent of the subjects\r\nthat may be comprehended in a single glance.  Increased mental cultivation\r\nhas given rise, in all classes of society, to an increased desire of\r\nembellishing life by augmenting the mass of ideas, and by multiplying means\r\nfor their generalization; and this sentiment fully refutes the vague\r\naccusations advanced against the age in which we live, showing that other\r\ninterests, besides the material wants of life, occupy the minds of men.\r\n\r\nIt is almost with reluctance that I am about to speak of a sentiment, which\r\nappears to arise from narrow-minded views, or from a certain weak and morbid\r\nsentimentality -- I allude to the 'fear' entertained by some persons, that\r\nnature may by degrees lose a portion of the charm and magic of her power,\r\np 39\r\nas we learn more and more how to unvail her secrets, comprehend the\r\nmechanism of the movements of the heavenly bodies, and estimate numerically\r\nthe intensity of natural forces.  It is true that, properly speaking, the\r\nforces of nature can only exercise a magical power over us as long as their\r\naction is shrouded in mystery and darkness, and does not admit of being\r\nclassed among the conditions with which experience has made us acquainted.\r\nThe effect of such a power is, therefore, to excite the imagination, but\r\nthat, assuredly, is not the faculty of mind we would evoke to preside over\r\nthe laborious and elaborate observations by which we strive to attain to a\r\nknowledge of the greatness and excellence of the laws of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer who, by the aid of the heliometer or a double-refracting\r\nprism,* determines the diameter of planetary bodies; who measures patiently\r\nyear after year, the meridian altitude and the relative distances of stars,\r\nor who seeks a telescopic comet in a group of nebulae, does not feel his\r\nimagination more excited -- and this is the very guarantee of the precision\r\nof his labors -- than the botanist who counts the divisions of the calyx, or\r\nthe number of stamens in a flower, or examines the connected or the separate\r\nteeth of the peristoma surrounding the capsule of a moss.  Yet the\r\nmultiplied angular measurements on the one hand, and the detail of organic\r\nrelations on the other, alike aid in preparing the way for the attainment of\r\nhigher views of the laws of the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *Arago's ocular micrometer, a happy improvement upon Rochon's\r\nprismatic or double-refraction micrometer.  See M. Mathieu's note in\r\nDelambre's 'Histoire de l'Astronomie au dix-huitieme Siecle', 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not confound the disposition of mind in the observer at the time he\r\nis pursuing his labors, with the ulterior greatness of the views resulting\r\nfrom investigation and the exercise of thought.  The physical philosopher\r\nmeasures with admirable sagacity the waves of light of unequal length which\r\nby interference mutually strengthen or destroy each other, even with respect\r\nto their chemical actions; the astronomer, armed with powerful telescopes,\r\npenetrates the regions of space, contemplates, on the extremest confines of\r\nour solar system, the satellites of Uranus, or decomposes faintly sparkling\r\npoints into double stars differing in color.  The botanist discovers the\r\nconstancy of the gyratory motion of the chara in the greater number of\r\nvegetable cells, and recognizes in the genera and natural families of plants\r\nthe intimate relations or organic forms.  The vault of heaven, studded with\r\nnebulae\r\np 40\r\nand stars, and the rich vegetable mantle that covers the soil in the climate\r\nof palms, can not surely fail to produce on the minds of these laborious\r\nobservers of nature an impression more imposing and more worthy of the\r\nmajesty of creation than on those who are unaccustomed to investigate the\r\ngreat mutual relations of phenomena.  I can not, therefore, agree with Burke\r\nwhen he says, \"it is our ignorance of natural things that causes all our\r\nadmiration and chiefly excites our passions.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the illusion of the senses would make the stars stationary in the\r\nvault of heaven, Astronomy, by her aspiring labors, has assigned indefinite\r\nbounds to space; and if she have set limits to the great nebula to which our\r\nsolar system belongs, it has only been to show us in those remote regions of\r\nour optic powers, islet on islet of scattered nebulae.  The feeling of the\r\nsublime, so far as it arises from a contemplation of the distance of the\r\nstars, of their greatness and physical extent, reflects itself in the\r\nfeeling of the infinite, which belongs to another sphere of ideas included\r\nin the domain of mind.  The solemn and imposing impressions excited by this\r\nsentiment are owing to the combination of which we have spoken, and to the\r\nanalogous character of the enjoyment and emotions awakened in us, whether we\r\nfloat on the surface of the great deep, stand on some lonely mountain summit\r\nenveloped in the half-transparent vapory vail of the atmosphere, or by the\r\naid of powerful optical instruments scan the regions of space, and see the\r\nremote nebulous mass resolve itself into worlds of stars.\r\n\r\nThe mere accumulation of unconnected observations of details, devoid of\r\ngeneralization of ideas, may doubtlessly have tended to create and foster\r\nthe deeply-rooted prejudice, that the study of the exact sciences must\r\nnecessarily chill the feelings, and diminish the nobler enjoyments attendant\r\nupon a contemplation of nature.  Those who still cherish such erroneous\r\nviews in the present age, and amid the progress of public opinion, and the\r\nadvancement of all branches of knowledge, fail in duly appreciating the\r\nvalue of every enlargement of the sphere of intellect, and the importance of\r\nthe detail of isolated facts in leading us on to general results.  The fear\r\nof sacrificing the free enjoyment of nature, under the influence of\r\nscientific reasoning, is often associated with an apprehension that every\r\nmind may not be capable of grasping the truths of the philosophy of nature.\r\nIt is certainly true that in the midst of the universal fluctuation of\r\nphenomena and vital\r\np 41\r\nforces -- in that inextricable net-work of organisms by turns developed and\r\ndestroyed -- each step that we make in the more intimate knowledge of nature\r\nleads us to the entrance of new labyrinths; but the excitement produced by a\r\npresentiment of discovery, the vague intuition of the mysteries to be\r\nunfolded, and the multiplicity of the paths before us, all tend to stimulate\r\nthe exercise of thought in every stage of knowledge.  The discovery of each\r\nseparate law of nature leads to the establishment of some other more general\r\nlaw, or at least indicates to the intelligent observer its existence.\r\nNature, as a celebrated physiologist* has defined it, and as the word was\r\ninterpreted by the Greeks and Romans, is \"that which is ever growing and\r\never unfolding itself in new forms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote] *Carus, 'Von den Urtheilen des Knochen und Schalen Gerustes',\r\n1828 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe series of organic types becomes extended or perfected in proportion as\r\nhitherto unknown regions are laid open to our view by the labors and\r\nresearches of travelers and observers; as living organisms are compared with\r\nthose which have disappeared in the great revolutions of our planet; and as\r\nmicroscopes are made more perfect, and are more extensively and efficiently\r\nemployed.  In the midst of this immense variety, and this periodic\r\ntransformation of animal and vegetable productions, we see incessantly\r\nrevealed the primordial mystery of all organic development, that same great\r\nproblem of 'metamorphosis' which Göthe has treated with more than common\r\nsagacity, and to the solution of which man is urged by his desire of\r\nreducing vital forms to the smallest number of fundamental types.  As men\r\ncontemplate the riches of nature, and see the mass of observations\r\nincessantly increasing before them, they become impressed with the intimate\r\nconviction that the surface and the interior of the earth, the depths of the\r\nocean, and the regions of air will still, when thousands and thousands of\r\nyears have passed away, open to the scientific observer untrodden paths of\r\ndiscovery.  The regret of Alexander can not be applied to the progress of\r\nobservation and intelligence.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] * Plut., in 'Vita Alex. Magni', cap. 7\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral considerations, whether they treat of the agglomeration of matter in\r\nthe heavenly bodies, or of the geographical distribution of terrestrial\r\norganisms, are not only in themselves more attractive than special studies,\r\nbut they also afford superior advantages to those who are unable to devote\r\nmuch time to occupations of this nature.  The different branches of the\r\nstudy of natural history are only accessible in certain positions of social\r\nlife, and do not, at every season\r\np 42\r\nand in every climate, present like enjoyments.  Thus, in the dreary regions\r\nof the north, man is deprived for a long period of the year of the spectacle\r\npresented by the activity of the productive forces of organic nature; and if\r\nthe mind be directed to one sole class of objects, the most animated\r\nnarratives of voyages in distant lands will fail to interest and attract us,\r\nif they do not touch upon the subjects to which we are most partial.\r\n\r\nAs the history of nations -- if it were always able to trace events to their\r\ntrue causes -- might solve the ever-recurring enigma of the oscillations\r\nexperienced by the alternately progressive and retrograde movement of human\r\nsociety, so might also the physical description of the world, the science of\r\nthe 'Cosmos', if it were grasped by a powerful intellect, and based upon a\r\nknowledge of all the results of discovery up to a given period, succeed in\r\ndispelling a portion of the contradictions which, at first sight, appear to\r\narise from the complication or phenomena and the multitude of the\r\nperturbations simultaneously manifested.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the laws of nature, whether we can trace them in the\r\nalternate ebb and flow of the ocean, in the measured path of comets, or in\r\nthe mutual attractions of multiple stars, alike increases our sense of the\r\ncalm of nature, while the chimera so long cherished by the human mind in its\r\nearly and intuitive contemplations, the belief in a \"discord of the\r\nelements,\" seems gradually to vanish in proportion as science extends her\r\nempire.  General views lead us habitually to consider each organism as a\r\npart of the entire creation, and to recognize in the plant or the animal not\r\nmerely an isolated species, but a form linked in the chain of being to other\r\nforms either living or extinct.  They aid us in comprehending the relations\r\nthat exist between the most recent discoveries and those which have prepared\r\nthe way for them.  Although fixed to one point of space, we eagerly grasp at\r\na knowledge of that which has been observed in different and far-distant\r\nregions.  We delight in tracking the course of the bold mariner through seas\r\nof polar ice, or in following him to the summit of that volcano of the\r\nantarctic pole, whose fires may be seen from afar, even at mid-day.  It is\r\nby an acquaintance with the results of distant voyages that we may learn to\r\ncomprehend some of the marvels of terrestrial magnetism, and be thus led to\r\nappreciate the importance of the establishments of the numerous\r\nobservatories which in the present day cover both hemispheres, and are\r\ndesigned to note\r\np 43\r\nthe simultaneous occurrence of perturbations, and the frequency and duration\r\nof 'magnetic storms.'\r\n\r\nLet me be permitted here to touch upon a few points connected with\r\ndiscoveries, whose importance can only be estimated by those who have\r\ndevoted themselves to the study of the physical sciences generally.\r\nExamples chosen from among the phenomena to which special attention has been\r\ndirected in recent times, will throw additional light upon the preceding\r\nconsiderations.  Without a preliminary knowledge of the orbits of comets, we\r\nshould be unable duly to appreciate the importance attached to the discovery\r\nof one of these bodies, whose elliptical orbit is included in the narrow\r\nlimits of our solar system, and which has revealed the existence of an\r\nethereal fluid, tending to diminish its centrifugal force and the period of\r\nits revolution.\r\n\r\nThe superficial half-knowledge, so characteristic of the present day, which\r\nleads to the introduction of vaguely comprehended scientific views into\r\ngeneral conversation, also gives rise, under various forms, to the\r\nexpression of alarm at the supposed danger of a collision between the\r\ncelestial bodies, or of disturbance in the climatic relations of our globe.\r\nThese phantoms of the imagination are so much the more injurious as they\r\nderive their source from dogmatic pretensions to true science.  The history\r\nof the atmosphere, and of the annual variations of its temperature, extends\r\nalready sufficiently far back to show the recurrence of slight disturbances\r\nin the mean temperature of any given place, and thus affords sufficient\r\nguarantee against the exaggerated apprehension of a general and progressive\r\ndeterioration of the climates of Europe.  Encke's comet, which is one of the\r\nthree 'interior comets', completes its course in 1200 days, but from the\r\nform and position of its orbit it is as little dangerous to the earth as\r\nHalley's great comet, whose revolution is not completed in less than\r\nseventy-six years (and which appeared less brilliant in 1835 than it had\r\ndone in 1759):  the interior comet of Biela intersects the earth's orbit, it\r\nis true, but it can only approach our globe when its proximity to the sun\r\ncoincides with our winter solstice.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of heat received by a planet, and whose unequal distribution\r\ndetermines the meteorological variations of its atmosphere, depends alike\r\nupon the light-engendering force of the sun; that is to say, upon the\r\ncondition of its gaseous coverings, and upon the relative position of the\r\nplanet and the central body.\r\n\r\np 44\r\nThere are variations, it is true, which, in obedience to the laws of\r\nuniversal gravitation, affect the form of the earth's orbit and the\r\ninclination of the ecliptic, that is, the angle which the axis of the earth\r\nmakes with the plane of its orbit; but these periodical variations are so\r\nslow, and are restricted within such narrow limits, that their thermic\r\neffects would hardly be appreciable by our instruments in many thousands of\r\nyears.  The astronomical causes of a refrigeration of our globe, and of the\r\ndiminution of moisture at its surface, and the nature and frequency of\r\ncertain epidemics -- phenomena which are often discussed in the present day\r\naccording to the benighted views of the Middle Ages -- ought to be\r\nconsidered as beyond the range of our experience in physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nPhysical astronomy presents us with other phenomena, which can not be fully\r\ncomprehended in all their vastness without a previous acquirement of general\r\nviews regarding the forces that govern the universe.  Such, for instance,\r\nare the innumerable double stars, or rather suns, which revolve round one\r\ncommon center of gravity, and thus reveal in distant worlds the existence of\r\nthe Newtonian law; the larger or smaller number of spots upon the sun, that\r\nis to say, the openings formed through the luminous and opaque atmosphere\r\nsurrounding the solid nucleus; and the regular appearance about the 13th of\r\nNovember and the 11th of August, of shooting stars, which probably form part\r\nof a belt of asteroids, intersecting the earth's orbit, and moving with\r\nplanetary velocity.\r\n\r\nDescending from the celestial regions to the earth, we would fain inquire\r\ninto the relations that exist between the oscillations of the pendulum in\r\nair (the theory of which has been perfected by Bessel) and the density of\r\nour planet; and how the pendulum, acting the part of a plummet, can, to a\r\ncertain extent, throw light upon the geological constitution of strata at\r\ngreat depths?  By means of this instrument we are enabled to trace the\r\nstriking analogy which exists between the formation of the granular rocks\r\ncomposing the lava currents ejected from active volcanoes, and those\r\nendogenous masses of granite, porphyry, and serpentine, which, issuing from\r\nthe interior of the earth, have broken, as eruptive rocks, through the\r\nsecondary strata, and modified them by contact, either in rendering them\r\nharder by the introduction of silex, or reducing them into dolomite, or,\r\nfinally, by inducing within them the formation of crystals of the most\r\nvaried composition.  The elevation of sporadic islands, of\r\np 45\r\ndomes of trachyte, and cones of basalt, by the elastic forces emanating from\r\nthe fluid interior of our globe, has led one of the first geologists of the\r\nage, Leopold von Buch, to the theory of the elevation of continents, and of\r\nmountain chains generally.  This action of subterranean forces in breaking\r\nthrough and elevating strata of sedimentary rocks, of which the coast of\r\nChili, in consequence of a great earthquake, furnished a recent example,\r\nleads to the assumption that the pelagic shells found by M. Bonpland and\r\nmyself on the ridge of the Andes, at an elevation of more than 15,000\r\nEnglish feet, may have been conveyed to so extraordinary a position, not by\r\na rising of the ocean, but by the agency of volcanic forces capable of\r\nelevating into ridges the softened crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nI apply the term 'volcanic', in the widest sense of the word, to every\r\naction exercised by the interior of a planet on its external crust.  The\r\nsurface of our globe, and that of the moon, manifest traces of this action,\r\nwhich in the former, at least, has varied during the course of ages.  Those\r\nwho are ignorant of the fact that the internal heat of the earth increases\r\nso rapidly with the increase of depth that granite is in a state of fusion\r\nabout twenty or thirty geographical miles below the surface,* can not have a\r\nclear conception of the causes, and the simultaneous occurrence of volcanic\r\neruptions at places widely removed from one another, or of the extent and\r\nintersection of 'circles of commotion' in earthquakes, or of the uniformity\r\nof temperature, and equality of chemical composition observed in thermal\r\nsprings during a long course of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  * The determinations usually given of the point of fusion are in\r\ngeneral much too high for refracting substances.  According to the very\r\naccurate researches of Mitscherlich, the melting point of granite can hardly\r\nexceed 2372 degrees F.\r\n[Dr. Mantell states in 'The Wonders of Geology', 1848, vol. i., p. 34, that\r\nthis increase of temperature amounts to 1 degree of Fahrenheit for every\r\nfifty-four feet of vertical depth.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quantity of heat peculiar to a planet is, however, a matter of such\r\nimportance -- being the result of its primitive condensation, and varying\r\naccording to the nature and duration of the radiation -- that the study of\r\nthis subject may throw some degree of light on the history of the\r\natmosphere, and the distribution of the organic bodies imbedded in the solid\r\ncrust of the earth.  This study enables us to understand how a tropical\r\ntemperature, independent of latitude (that is, of the distance from the\r\npoles), may have been produced by deep fissures remaining open, and exhaling\r\nheat from the interior\r\np 46\r\nof the globe, at a period when the earth's crust was still furrowed and\r\nrent, and only in a state of semi-solidification; and a primordial condition\r\nis thus revealed to us, in which the temperature of the atmosphere, and\r\nclimates generally, were owing rather to a liberation of caloric and of\r\ndifferent gaseous emanations (that is to say, rather to the energetic\r\nreaction of the interior on the exterior) than to the position of the earth\r\nwith respect to the central body, the sun.\r\n\r\nThe cold regions of the earth contain, deposited in sedimentary strata, the\r\nproducts of tropical climates; thus, in the coal formations, we find the\r\ntrunks of palms standing upright amid coniferae, tree ferns, goniatites, and\r\nfishes having rhomboidal osseous scales;* in the Jura limestone, colossal\r\nskeletons of crocodiles, plesiosauri, planulites, and stems of the cycadeae;\r\nin the chalk formations, small polythalmia and bryozoa, whose species still\r\nexist in our seas; in tripoli, or polishing slate, in the semi-opal and the\r\nfarina-like opal or mountain meal, agglomerations of siliceous infusoria,\r\nwhich have been brought to light by the powerful microscope of Ehrenberg;**\r\nand, lastly, in transported soils, and in certain caves, the bones of\r\nelephants, hyenas, and lions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote] *See the classical work on the fishes of the Old World by\r\nAgassiz, 'Rech. sur les Poissons Fossiles', 1834, vol. i., p. 38; vol. ii.,\r\np. 3, 28, 34, App., p. 6.  The whole genus of Amblypterus, Ag., nearly\r\nallied to Palaeoniscus (called also Palaeothrissum), lies buried beneath the\r\nJura formations in the old carboniferous strata.  Scales which, in some\r\nfishes, as in the family of Lepidoides (order of Ganoides), are formed like\r\nteeth, and covered in certain parts with enamel, belong, after the\r\nPlacoides, to the oldest forms of fossil fishes; their living\r\nrepresentatives are still found in two genera, the 'Bichir' of the Nile and\r\nSenegal, and the 'Lepidosteus' of the Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote] **[The 'polishing slate' of Bilin is stated by M. Ehrenberg to\r\nform a 'series' of strata fourteen feet in thickness, entirely made up of\r\nthe siliceous shells of 'Gaillonellae', of such extreme minuteness that a\r\ncubic inch of the stone contains forty-one thousand millions!  The\r\n'Bergmehl' ('mountain meal' or 'fossil farina') of San Fiora, in Tuscany, is\r\none mass of animalculites.  See the interesting work of G. A. Mantell, 'On\r\nthe Medals of Creation', vol. i., p. 233.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate acquaintance with the physical phenomena of the universe leads\r\nus to regard the products of warm latitudes that are thus found in a fossil\r\ncondition in northern regions not merely as incentives to barren curiosity,\r\nbut as subjects awakening deep reflection, and opening new sources of study.\r\n\r\nThe number and the variety of the objects I have alluded to give rise to the\r\nquestion whether general considerations of physical phenomena can be made\r\nsufficiently clear to persons who have not acquired a detailed and special\r\nknowledge of\r\np 47\r\ndescriptive natural history, geology, or mathematical astronomy?  I think we\r\nought to distinguish here between him whose task it is to collect the\r\nindividual details of various observations, and study the mutual relations\r\nexisting among them, and him to whom these relations are to be revealed,\r\nunder the form of general results.  The former should be acquainted with the\r\nspecialities of phenomena, that he may arrive at a generalization of ideas\r\nas the result, at least in part, of his own observations, experiments, and\r\ncalculations.  It can not be denied, that where there is an absence of\r\npositive knowledge of physical phenomena, the general results which impart\r\nso great a charm to the study of nature can not all be made equally clear\r\nand intelligible to the reader, but still I venture to hope, that in the\r\nwork which I am now preparing on the physical laws of the universe, the\r\ngreater part of the facts advanced can be made manifest without the\r\nnecessity of appealing to fundamental views and principles.  The picture of\r\nnature thus drawn, notwithstanding the want of distinctness of some of its\r\noutlines, will not be the less able to enrich the intellect, enlarge the\r\nsphere of ideas, and nourish and vivify the imagination.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, some truth in the accusation advanced against many German\r\nscientific works, that they lessen the value of general views by an\r\naccumulation of detail, and do not sufficiently distinguish between those\r\ngreat results which form, as it were, the beacon lights of science, and the\r\nlong series of means by which they have been attained.  This method of\r\ntreating scientific subjects led the most illustrious of our poets* to\r\nexclaim with impatience, \"The Germans have the art of making science\r\ninaccessible.\"  An edifice can not produce a striking effect until the\r\nscaffolding is removed, that had of necessity been used during its erection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *Gothe, in 'Die Aphorismen uber Naturwissenschaft', bd. I., s.\r\n155 ('Werke kleine Ausgabe','von' 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the uniformity of figure observed in the distribution of continental\r\nmasses, which all terminate toward the south in a pyramidal form, and expand\r\ntoward the north (a law that determines the nature of climates, the\r\ndirection of currents in the ocean and the atmosphere, and the transition of\r\ncertain types of tropical vegetation toward the southern temperate zone),\r\nmay be clearly apprehended without any knowledge of the geodesical and\r\nastronomical operations by means of which these pyramidal forms of\r\ncontinents have been determined.  In like manner, physical geography teaches\r\nus by how many leagues\r\np 48\r\nthe equatorial axis exceeds the polar axis of the globe, and shows us the\r\nmean equality of the flattening of the two hemispheres, without entailing on\r\nus the necessity of giving the detail of the measurement of the degrees in\r\nthe meridian, or the observations on the pendulum, which have led us to know\r\nthat the true figure of our globe is not exactly that of a regular ellipsoid\r\nof revolution, and that this irregularity is reflected in the corresponding\r\nirregularity of the movements of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe views of comparative geography have been specially enlarged by that\r\nadmirable work, 'Erdkunde im Verhältniss zur Natur und sur Geschichte', in\r\nwhich Carl Ritter so ably delineates the physiognomy of our globe, and shows\r\nthe influence of its external configuration on the physical phenomena on its\r\nsurface, on the migrations, laws, and manners of nations, and on all the\r\nprincipal historical events enacted upon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrance possesses an immortal work, 'L'Exposition du Système du Monde', in\r\nwhich the author has combined the results of the highest astronomical and\r\nmathematical labors, and presented them to his readers free from all\r\nprocesses of demonstration.  The structure of the heavens is here reduced to\r\nthe simple solution of a great problem in mechanics; yet Laplace's work has\r\nnever yet been accused of incompleteness and want of profundity.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between dissimilar subjects, and the separation of the\r\ngeneral from the special, are not only conducive to the attainment of\r\nperspicuity in the composition of a physical history of the universe, but\r\nare also the means by which a character of greater elevation may be imparted\r\nto the study of nature.  By the suppression of all unnecessary detail, the\r\ngreat masses are better seen, and the reasoning faculty is enabled to grasp\r\nall that might otherwise escape the limited range of the senses.\r\n\r\nThe exposition of general results has, it must be owned, been singularly\r\nfacilitated by the happy revolution experienced since the close of the last\r\ncentury, in the condition of all the special sciences, more particularly of\r\ngeology, chemistry, and descriptive natural history.  In proportion as laws\r\nadmit of more general application, and as sciences mutually enrich each\r\nother, and by their extension become connected together in more numerous and\r\nmore intimate relations, the development of general truths may be given with\r\nconciseness devoid of superficiality.  On being first examined, all\r\nphenomena appear to be\r\np 49\r\nisolated, and it is only by the result of a multiplicity of observations,\r\ncombined by reason, that we are able to trace the mutual relations existing\r\nbetween them.  If, however, in the present age, which is so strongly\r\ncharacterized by a brilliant course of scientific discoveries, we perceive a\r\nwant of connection in the phenomena of certain sciences, we may anticipate\r\nthe revelation of new facts, whose importance will probably be commensurate\r\nwith the attention directed to these branches of study.  Expectations of\r\nthis nature may be entertained with regard to meteorology, several parts of\r\noptics, and to radiating heat, and electro-magnetism, since the admirable\r\ndiscoveries of Melloni and Faraday.  A fertile field is here opened to\r\ndiscovery, although the voltaic pile has already taught us the intimate\r\nconnection existing between electric, magnetic, and chemical phenomena.  Who\r\nwill venture to affirm that we have any precise knowledge, in the present\r\nday, of that part of the atmosphere which is not oxygen, or that thousands\r\nof gaseous substances affecting our organs may not be mixed with the\r\nnitrogen, or, finally, that we have even discovered the whole number of the\r\nforces which pervade the universe?\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this essay on the physical history of the world to\r\nreduce all sensible phenomena to a small number of abstract principles,\r\nbased on reason only.  The physical history of the universe, whose\r\nexposition I attempt to develop, does not pretend to rise to the perilous\r\nabstractions of a purely rational science of nature, and is simply a\r\n'physical geography, combined with a description of the regions of space and\r\nthe bodies occupying them.'  Devoid of the profoundness of a purely\r\nspeculative philosophy, my essay on the 'Cosmos' treats of the contemplation\r\nof the universe, and is based upon a rational empiricism, that is to say,\r\nupon the results of the facts registered by science, and tested by the\r\noperations of the intellect.  It is within these limits alone that the work,\r\nwhich I now venture to undertake, appertains to the sphere of labor to which\r\nI have devoted myself throughout the course of my long scientific career.\r\nThe path of inquiry is not unknown to me, although it may be pursued by\r\nothers with greater success.  The unity which I seek to attain in the\r\ndevelopment of the great phenomena of the universe, is analogous to that\r\nwhich historical composition is capable of acquiring.  All points relating\r\nto the accidental individualities, and the essential variations of the\r\nactual, whether in the form and arrangement of natural objects in the\r\nstruggle of man against the elements, or of nations against nations, do not\r\nadmit of being\r\np 50\r\nbased only on a 'rational foundation' -- that is to say, of being deduced\r\nfrom ideas alone.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that a like degree of empiricism attaches to the Description\r\nof the Universe and to Civil History; but in reflecting upon physical\r\nphenomena and events, and tracing their causes by the process of reason, we\r\nbecome more and more convinced of the truth of the ancient doctrine, that\r\nthe forces inherent in matter, and those which govern the moral necessity,\r\nand in accordance with movements occurring periodically after longer or\r\nshorter intervals.\r\n\r\nIt is this necessity, this occult but permanent connection, this periodical\r\nrecurrence in the progressive development of forms, phenomena, and events,\r\nwhich constitute 'nature', obedient to the first impulse imparted to it.\r\nPhysics, as the term signifies, is limited to the explanation of the\r\nphenomena of the material world by the properties of matter.  The ultimate\r\nobject of the experimental sciences is, therefore, to discover laws, and to\r\ntrace their progressive generalization.  All that exceeds this goes beyond\r\nthe province of the physical description of the universe, and appertains to\r\na range of higher speculative views.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel Kant, one of the few philosophers who have escaped the imputation\r\nof impiety, has defined with rare sagacity the limits of physical\r\nexplanations, in his celebrated essay 'On the Theory and Structure of the\r\nHeavens', published at Konigsberg in 1755.\r\n\r\nThe study of a science that promises to lead us through the vast range of\r\ncreation may be compared to a journey in a far-distant land.  Before we set\r\nforth, we consider, and often with distrust, our own strength, and that of\r\nthe guide we have chosen.  But the apprehensions which have originated in\r\nthe abundance and the difficulties attached to the subjects we would\r\nembrace, recede from view as we remember that with the increase of\r\nobservations in the present day there has also arisen a more intimate\r\nknowledge of the connection existing among all phenomena.  It has not\r\nunfrequently happened, that the researches made at remote distances have\r\noften and unexpectedly thrown light upon subjects which had long resisted\r\nthe attempts made to explain them within the narrow limits of our own sphere\r\nof observation.  Organic forms that had long remained isolated, both in the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdom, have been connected by the discovery of\r\nintermediate links or stages of transition.  The geography of beings endowed\r\np 51\r\nwith life attains completeness as we see the species, genera, and entire\r\nfamilies belonging to one hemisphere, reflected as it were, in analogous\r\nanimal and vegetable forms in the opposite hemisphere.  There are, so to\r\nspeak, the 'equivalents' which mutually personate and replace one another in\r\nthe great series of organisms.  These connecting links and stages of\r\ntransition may be traced, alternately, in a deficiency or an excess of\r\ndevelopment of certain parts, in the mode of junction of distinct organs, in\r\nthe differences in the balance of forces, or in a resemblance to\r\nintermediate forms which are not permanent, but merely characteristic of\r\ncertain phases of normal development.  Passing from the consideration of\r\nbeings endowed with life to that of inorganic bodies, we find many striking\r\nillustrations of the high state of advancement to which modern geology has\r\nattained.  We thus see, according to the grand views of Elie de Beaumont,\r\nhow chains of mountains dividing different climates and floras and different\r\nraces of men, reveal to us their 'relative age', both by the character of\r\nthe sedimentary strata they have uplifted, and by the directions which they\r\nfollow over the long fissures and which the earth's crust is furrowed.\r\nRelations of superposition of trachyte and of syenitic porphyry, of diorite\r\nand of serpentine, which remain in the rich platinum districts of the Oural,\r\nand on the south-western declivity of the Siberian Alti, are elucidated by\r\nthe observations that have been made on the plateaux of Mexico and\r\nAntioquia, and in the unhealthy ravines of Choco.  The most important facts\r\non which the physical history of the world has been based in modern times,\r\nhave not been accumulated by chance.  It has at length been fully\r\nacknowledged, and the conviction is characteristic of the age, that the\r\nnarratives of distant travels, too long occupied in the mere recital of\r\nhazardous adventures, can only be made a source of instruction where the\r\ntraveler is acquainted with the condition of the science he would enlarge,\r\nand is guided by reason in his researches.\r\n\r\nIt is by this tendency to generalization, which is only dangerous in its\r\nabuse, that a great portion of the physical knowledge already acquired may\r\nbe made the common property of all classes of society; but, in order to\r\nrender the instruction impaired by these means commensurate with the\r\nimportance of the subject, it is desirable to deviate as widely as possible\r\nfrom the imperfect compilations designated, till the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, by the inappropriate term of 'popular\r\np 52\r\nknowledge.'  I take pleasure in persuading myself that scientific subjects\r\nmay be treated of in language at once dignified, grave, and animated, and\r\nthat those who are restricted within the circumscribed limits of ordinary\r\nlife, and have long remained strangers to an intimate communion with nature,\r\nmay thus have opened to them one of the richest sources of enjoyment, by\r\nwhich the mind is invigorated by the acquisition of new ideas.  Communion\r\nwith nature awakens within us perceptive faculties that had long lain\r\ndormant; and we thus comprehend at a single glance the influence exercised\r\nby physical discoveries on the enlargement of the sphere of intellect, and\r\nperceive how a judicious application of mechanics, chemistry, and other\r\nsciences may be made conducive to national prosperity.\r\n\r\nA more accurate knowledge of the connection of physical phenomena will also\r\ntend to remove the prevalent error that all branches of natural science are\r\nnot equally important in relation to general cultivation and industrial\r\nprogress.  An arbitrary distinction is frequently made between the various\r\ndegrees of importance appertaining to mathematical sciences, to the study of\r\norganized beings, the knowledge of electro-magnetism, and investigations of\r\nthe general properties of matter in its different conditions of molecular\r\naggregation; and it is not uncommon presumptuously to affix a supposed\r\nstigma upon researches of this nature, by terming them \"purely theoretical,\"\r\nforgetting , although the fact has been long attested, that in the\r\nobservation of a phenomenon, which at first sight appears to be wholly\r\nisolated, may be concealed the germ of a great discovery.  When Aloysio\r\nGalvani first stimulated the nervous fiber by the accidental contact of two\r\nheterogeneous metals, his contemporaries could never have anticipated that\r\nthe action of the voltaic pile would discover to us, in the alkalies, metals\r\nof a silvery luster, so light as to swim on water, and eminently\r\ninflammable; or that it would become a powerful instrument of chemical\r\nanalysis, and at the same time a thermoscope and a magnet.  When Hygens\r\nfirst observed, in 1678, the phenomenon of the polarization of light,\r\nexhibited in the difference between the two rays into which a pencil of\r\nlight divides itself in passing through a doubly refracting crystal, it\r\ncould not have been foreseen that, a century and a half later, the great\r\nphilosopher Arago would, by his discovery of 'chromatic polarization', be\r\nled to discern, by means of a small fragment of Iceland spar, whether solar\r\nlight emanates from a solid body or a gaseous covering, or\r\np 53\r\nwhether comets transmit light directly or merely by reflection.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *Arago's Discoveries in the year 1811. -- Delambro's 'Histoire\r\nde l'Ast.', p. 652.  (Passage already quoted.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn equal appreciation of all branches of the mathematical, physical, and\r\nnatural sciences is a special requirement of the present age, in which the\r\nmaterial wealth and the growing prosperity of nations are principally based\r\nupon a more enlightened employment of the products and forces of nature.\r\nThe most superficial glance at the present condition of Europe shows that a\r\ndiminution, or even a total annihilation of national prosperity, must be the\r\naward of those states who shrink with slothful indifference from the great\r\nstruggle of rival nations in the career of the industrial arts.  It is with\r\nnations as with nature, which, according to a happy expression of Göthe,*\r\n\"knows no pause in progress and development, and attaches her curse on all\r\ninaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *Gothe, in 'Die Aphorismen uber Naturwissenschaft.' -- 'Werke',\r\nbd. 1., s. 4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe propagation of an earnest and sound knowledge of science can therefore\r\nalone avert the dangers of which I have spoken.  Man can not act upon\r\nnature, or appropriate her forces to his own use, without comprehending\r\ntheir full extent, and having an intimate acquaintance with the laws of the\r\nphysical world.  Bacon has said that, in human societies, knowledge is\r\npower.  Both must rise and sink together.  But the knowledge that results\r\nfrom the free action of thought is at once the delight and the\r\nindestructible prerogative of man; and in forming part of the wealth of\r\nmankind, it not unfrequently serves as a substitute for the natural riches,\r\nwhich are but sparingly scattered over the earth.  Those states which take\r\nno active part in the general industrial movement, in the choice and\r\npreparation of natural substances, or in the application of mechanics and\r\nchemistry, and among whom this activity is not appreciated by all classes of\r\nsociety, will infallibly see their prosperity diminish in proportion as\r\nneighboring countries become strengthened and invigorated under the genial\r\ninfluence of arts and sciences.\r\n\r\nAs in nobler spheres of thought and sentiment, in philosophy, poetry, and\r\nthe fine arts, the object at which we aim ought to be an inward one -- an\r\nennoblement of the intellect -- so ought we likewise in our pursuit of\r\nscience, to strive after a knowledge of the laws and the principles of unity\r\nthat pervade the vital forces of the universe; and it is by such a course\r\nthat\r\np 54\r\nphysical studies may be made subservient to the progress of industry, which\r\nis a conquest of mind over matter.  By a happy connection of causes and\r\neffects, we often see the useful linked to the beautiful and the exalted.\r\nThe improvement of agriculture in the hands of freemen, and on properties of\r\na moderate extent -- the flourishing state of the mechanical arts freed from\r\nthe trammels of municipal restrictions -- the increased impetus imparted to\r\ncommerce by the multiplied means of the intellectual progress of mankind,\r\nand of the amelioration of political institutions, in which this progress is\r\nreflected.  The picture presented by modern history ought to convince those\r\nwho are tardy in awakening to the truth of the lesson it teaches.\r\n\r\nNor let it be feared that the marked predilection for the study of nature,\r\nand for industrial progress, which is so characteristic of the present age,\r\nshould necessarily have a tendency to retard the noble exertions of the\r\nintellect in the domains of philosophy, classical history, and antiquity, or\r\nto deprive the arts by which life is embellished of the vivifying breath of\r\nimagination.  Where all the germs of civilization are developed beneath the\r\naegis of free institutions and wise legislation, there is no cause for\r\napprehending that any one branch of knowledge should be cultivated to the\r\nprejudice of others.  All afford the state precious fruits, whether they\r\nyield nourishment to man and constitute his physical wealth, or whether,\r\nmore permanent in their nature, they transmit in the works of mind the glory\r\nof nations to remotest posterity.  The Spartans, notwithstanding their Doric\r\nausterity, prayed the gods to grant them \"the beautiful with the good.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *Pseudo-Plato, -- 'Alcib.', xi., p. 184, ed. Steph.; Plut.,\r\n'Instituta Laconica', p. 253, ed. Hatten.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will no longer dwell upon the considerations of the influence exercised by\r\nthe mathematical and physical sciences on all that appertains to the\r\nmaterial wants of social life, for the vast extent of the course on which I\r\nam entering forbids me to insist further upon the utility of these\r\napplications.  Accustomed to distant excursions, I may, perhaps, have erred\r\nin describing the path before us as more smooth and pleasant than it really\r\nis, for such is wont to be the practice of those who delight in guiding\r\nothers to the summits of lofty mountains:  they praise the view even when\r\ngreat part of the distant plains lie hidden by clouds, knowing that this\r\nhalf-transparent vapory vail imparts to the scene a certain charm from\r\np 55\r\nthe power exercised by the imagination over the domain of the senses.  In\r\nlike manner, from the height occupied by the physical history of the world,\r\nall parts of the horizon will not appear equally clear and well defined.\r\nThis indistinctness will not, however, be wholly owing to the present\r\nimperfect state of some of the sciences, but in part, likewise, to the\r\nunskillfulness of the guide who has imprudently ventured to ascend these\r\nlofty summits.\r\n\r\nThe object of this introductory notice is not, however, solely to draw\r\nattention to the importance and greatness of the physical history of the\r\nuniverse, for in the present day these are too well understood to be\r\ncontested, but likewise to prove how, without detriment to the stability of\r\nspecial studies, we may be enabled to generalize our ideas by concentrating\r\nthem in one common focus, and thus arrive at a point of view from which all\r\nthe organisms and forces of nature may be seen as one living active whole,\r\nanimated by one sole impulse.  \"Nature,\" as Schelling remarks in his poetic\r\ndiscourse on art, \"is not an inert mass; and to him who can comprehend her\r\nvast sublimity, she reveals herself as the creative force of the universe --\r\nbefore all time, eternal, ever active, she calls to life all things, whether\r\nperishable or imperishable.\"\r\n\r\nBy uniting, under one point of view, both the phenomena of our own globe and\r\nthose presented in the regions of space, we embrace the limits of the\r\nscience of the 'Cosmos', and convert the physical history of the globe into\r\nthe physical history of the universe, the one term being modeled upon that\r\nof the other.  This science of the Cosmos is not, however, to be regarded as\r\na mere encyclopedic aggregation of the most important and general results\r\nthat have been collected together from special branches of knowledge.  These\r\nresults are nothing more than the materials for a vast edifice, and their\r\ncombination can not constitute the physical history of the world, whose\r\nexalted part it is to show the simultaneous action and the connecting links\r\nof the forces which pervade the universe.  The distribution of organic types\r\nin different climates and at different elevations -- that is to say, the\r\ngeography of plants and animals -- differs as widely from botany and\r\ndescriptive zoology as geology does from mineralogy, properly so called.\r\nThe physical history of the universe must not, therefore, be confounded with\r\nthe 'Encyclopedias of the Natural Sciences', as they have hitherto been\r\ncompiled, and whose title is as vague as their limits are ill defined.  In\r\nthe work before us, partial facts will be considered only in relation to the\r\nwhole.\r\np 56\r\nThe higher the point of view, the greater is the necessity for a systematic\r\nmode of treating the subject in language at once animated and picturesque.\r\n\r\nBut thought and language have ever been most intimately allied.  If\r\nlanguage, by its originality of structure and its native richness, can, in\r\nits delineations, interpret thought with grace and clearness, and if, by its\r\nhappy flexibility, it can paint with vivid truthfulness the objects of the\r\nexternal world, it reacts at the same time upon thought, and animates it, as\r\nit were, with the breath of life.  It is this mutual reaction which makes\r\nwords more than mere signs and forms of thought; and the beneficent\r\ninfluence of a language is most strikingly manifested on its native soil,\r\nwhere it has sprung spontaneously from the minds of the people, whose\r\ncharacter it embodies.  Proud of a country that seeks to concentrate her\r\nstrength in intellectual unity, the writer recalls with delight the\r\nadvantages he has enjoyed in being permitted to express his thoughts in his\r\nnative language; and truly happy is he who, in attempting to give a lucid\r\nexposition of the great phenomena of the universe, is able to draw from the\r\ndepths of a language, which, through the free exercise of thought, and by\r\nthe effusions of creative fancy, has for centuries past exercised so\r\npowerful an influence over the destinies of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis material taken from pages 56 to 78\r\n\r\nCOSMOS: A Sketch of the Physical Description of the Universe, Vol. 1\r\nby Alexander von Humboldt\r\n\r\nTranslated by E C Otte\r\n\r\nfrom the 1858 Harper & Brothers edition of Cosmos, volume 1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\np 56\r\n\r\nLIMITS AND METHOD OF EXPOSITION OF THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\nI HAVE endeavored, in the preceding part of my work, to explain and\r\nillustrate, by various examples, how the enjoyments presented by the aspect\r\nof nature, varying as they do in the sources from when they flow, may be\r\nmultiplied and ennobled by an acquaintance with the connection of phenomena\r\nand the laws by which they are regulated.  It remains, then, for me to\r\nexamine the spirit of the method in which the exposition of the 'physical\r\ndescription of the universe' should be conducted, and to indicate the limits\r\nof this science in accordance with the views I have acquired in the course\r\nof my studies and travels in various parts of the earth.  I trust I may\r\nflatter myself with a hope that a treatise of this nature will justify the\r\ntitle I have ventured to adopt for my work, and exonerate me from the\r\nreproach of a presumption that would be doubly reprehensible in a scientific\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the delineation of the partial phenomena\r\np 57\r\nwhich are found to be distributed in various groups, I would consider a few\r\ngeneral questions intimately connected together, and bearing upon the nature\r\nof our knowledge of the external world and its different relations, in all\r\nepochs of history and in all phases of intellectual advancement.  Under this\r\nhead will be comprised the following considerations:\r\n\r\n1.  The precise limits of the physical description of the universe,\r\nconsidered as a distinct science.\r\n\r\n2.  A brief enumeration of the totality of natural phenomena, presented\r\nunder the form of a 'general delineation of nature.'\r\n\r\n3.  The influence of the external world on the imagination and feelings,\r\nwhich has acted in modern times as a powerful impulse toward the study of\r\nnatural science, by giving animation to the description of distant regions\r\nand to the delineation of natural scenery, as far as it is characterized by\r\nvegetable physiognomy and by the cultivation of exotic plants, and their\r\narrangement in well-contrasted groups.\r\n\r\n4.  The history of the contemplation of nature, or the progressive\r\ndevelopment of the idea of the Cosmos, considered with reference to the\r\nhistorical and geographical facts that have led to the discovery of the\r\nconnection of phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe higher the point of view from which natural phenomena may be considered,\r\nthe more necessary it is to circumscribe the science within its just limits,\r\nand to distinguish it from all other analogous or auxiliary studies.\r\n\r\nPhysical cosmography is founded on the contemplation of all created things\r\n-- all that exists in space, whether as substances or forces -- that is, all\r\nthe material beings that constitute the universe.  The science which I would\r\nattempt to define presents itself, therefore, to man, as the inhabitant of\r\nthe earth, under a two-fold form -- as the earth itself and the regions of\r\nspace.  It is with a view of showing the actual character and the\r\nindependence of the study of physical cosmography, and at the same time\r\nindicating the nature of its relations to 'general physics, descriptive\r\nnatural history, geology, and comparative geography', that I will pause for\r\na few moments to consider that portion of the science of the Cosmos which\r\nconcerns the earth.  As the history of philosophy does not consist of a mere\r\nmaterial enumeration of the philosophical views entertained in different\r\nages, neither should the physical description of the universe be a simple\r\nencyclopedic compilation of the sciences we have enumerated.  The difficulty\r\nof defining the limits of intimately-connected studies has been increased,\r\nbecause for centuries it has been customary to designate various branches\r\np 58\r\nof empirical knowledge by terms which admit either of too wide or too\r\nlimited a definition of the ideas which they were intended to convey, and\r\nare, besides, objectionable from  having had a different signification in\r\nthose classical languages of antiquity from thish chey have been borrowed.\r\nThe terms physiology, physics, natural history, geology and geography arose,\r\nand were commonly used, long before clear ideas were entertained of the\r\ndiversity of objects embraced by these sciences, and consequently of their\r\nreciprocal limitation.  Such is the influence of long habit upon language,\r\nthat by one of the nations of Europe most advanced in civilization the word\r\n\"physic\" is applied to medicine, while in a society of justly deserved\r\nuniversal reputation, technical chemistry, geology and astronomy (purely\r\nexperimental sciences) are comprised under the head of \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions.\"\r\n\r\nAn attempt has often been made, and almost always in vain, to substitute new\r\nand more appropriate terms for these ancient designations, which,\r\nnotwithstanding their undoubted vagueness, are now generally understood.\r\nThese changes have been proposed, for the most part, by those who have\r\noccupied themselves with the general classification of the various branches\r\nof knowledge, from the first appearance of the great encyclopedia\r\n('Margarita Philosophica') of Gregory Reisch,* prior of the Chartreuse at\r\nFreiburg, toward the close of the fifteenth century, to Lord Bacon, and from\r\nBacon to D'Alembert; and in recent times to an eminent physicist, Andre\r\nMarie Ampere.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *The 'Margarita Philosophica' of Gregory Reisch, prior of the\r\nChartreuse at Freiburg, first appeared under the following title:  Aepitome\r\nomnis Philosophiæ, alias Margarita Philosophica, tractans de omni generi\r\nscibili.  The Heidelberg edition (1486), and that of Strasburg (1504), both\r\nbear this title, but the first part was suppressed in the Freiburg edition\r\nof the same year, as well as in the twelve subsequent editions, which\r\nsucceeded one another, at short intervals, till 1535.  This work exercised a\r\ngreat influence on the diffusion of mathematical and physical sciences\r\ntoward the beginning of the sixteenth century, and Crasles, the learned\r\nauthor of 'L'Aperçu  Historique des Methodes en Géometrica' (1837) has\r\nshown the great importance of Reisch's 'Encyclopedia' in the history of\r\nmathematics in the Middle Ages.  I have had recourse to a passage in the\r\n'Margarita Philosophica', found only in the edition of 1513, to elucidate\r\nthe important question of the relations between the statements of the\r\ngeographer of Saint-Die, Hylacomilus (Martin Waldseemuller), the first who\r\ngave the name of America to the New Continent, and those of Amerigo\r\nVespucci, Rene, King of Jerusalem and Duke of Lorraine, as also those\r\ncontained in the celebrated editions of Ptolemy of 1513 and 1522.  See my\r\n'Examen Critique de la Gegraphie du Nouveau Continent, et des Progres de\r\nl'Astronomie Nautique aux 15e et 16e Siecles', t. iv., p. 99-125.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] II Ampère, 'Essai sur la Phil. des Sciences', 1834, p. 25.\r\nWhewell, 'Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences', vol. ii., p. 277.  Park,\r\n'Pantology', p. 87.\r\n\r\n\r\np 59\r\nThe selection of an inappropriate Greek nomenclature has perhaps been even\r\nmore prejudicial to the last of these attempts than the injudicious use of\r\nbinary divisions and the excessive multiplication of groups.\r\n\r\nThe physical description of the world, considering the universe as an object\r\nof the external senses, does undoubtedly require the aid of general physics\r\nand of descriptive natural history, but thecontemplation of all created\r\nthings, which are linked together, and form one 'whole', animated by\r\ninternal forces, given to the science we are considering a peculiar\r\ncharacter.  Phyical science considers only the general properties of bodies;\r\nit is the product of abstraction -- a generalization of perceptible\r\nphenomena; and even in the work in which were laid the first foundations of\r\ngeneral physics, in the eight books on physics of Aristotle,* all the\r\nphenomena of nature are considered as depending upon the primitive and vital\r\naction of one sole force, from which emaate all the movements of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] * All changes in the physical world may be reduced to motion.\r\nAristot., 'Phys.

'De Genere et Corr.', ii., 10, p. 336.\r\nPseudo-Aristot., 'De Mundo.' cap. vi., p. 398.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial portion of physical cosmography, for which I would willingly\r\nretain the expressive designation of 'physical geography', treats of the\r\ndistribution of magnetism in our planet with relation to its intensity and\r\ndirection, but does not enter into a consideration of the laws of attraction\r\nor repulsion of the poles, or the means of eliciting either permanent or\r\ntransitory electro-magnetic currents.  Physical geography depicts in broad\r\noutlines the even or irregular configuration of continents, the relations of\r\nsuperficial area, and the distribution of continental masses in the two\r\nhemispheres, a distribution which exercises a powerful influence on the\r\ndiversity of climate and the meteorological modifications of the atmosphere;\r\nthis science defines the character of mountain chains, which, having been\r\nelevated at different epochs, constitute distinct systems, whether they run\r\nin parallel lines or intersect one another; determines the mean height of\r\ncontinents above the level of the sea, the position of the center of gravity\r\nof their volume, and the relation of the highest summits of mountain chains\r\nto the mean elevation of their crests, or to their proximity with the\r\nsea-shore.  It depicts the eruptive rocks as principles of movement, acting\r\nupon the sedimentary rocks by traversing, uplifting, and inclining them at\r\nvarious angles; it\r\np 60\r\nconsiders volcanoes either as isolated, or ranged in single or in double\r\nseries, and extending their sphere of action to various distances, either by\r\nraising long and narrow lines of rocks, or by means of circles of commotion,\r\nwhich expand or diminish in diameter in the course of ages.  This\r\nterrestrial portion of the science of the Cosmos describes the strife of the\r\nliquid element with the solid land; it indicates the features possessed in\r\ncommon by all great rivers in the upper and lower portion of their course,\r\nand in their mode of bifurcation when their basins are unclosed; and shows\r\nus rivers breaking through the highest mountain chains, or following for a\r\nlong time a course parallel to them, either at their base, or at a\r\nconsiderable distance, where the elevation of the strata of the mountain\r\nsystem and the direction of their inclination correspond to the\r\nconfiguration of the table-land.  It is only the general results of\r\ncomparative orography and hydrography that belong to the science whose true\r\nlimits I am desirous of determining, and not the special enumeration of the\r\ngreatest elevations of our globe, of active volcanoes, of rivers, and the\r\nnumber of their tributaries, these details falliing rather within the domain\r\nof geography, properly so called.  We would here only consider phenomena in\r\ntheir mutual connection, and in their relations to different zones of our\r\nplanet, and to its physical constitution generally.  The specialties both of\r\ninorganic and organized matter, classed according to analogy of form and\r\ncomposition, undoubtedly constitute a most interesting branch of study, but\r\nthey appertain to a sphere of ideas having no affinity with the subject of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nThe description of different countries certainly furnishes us with the most\r\nimportant materials for the composition of a physical geography; but the\r\ncombination of these different descriptions, ranged in series, would as\r\nlittle give us a true image of the general conformation of the irregular\r\nsurface of our globe, as a succession of all the floras of different regions\r\nwould constitute that which I designate as a 'Geography of Plants.'  It is\r\nby subjecting isolated observations to the process of thought, and by\r\ncombining and comparing them, that we are enabled to discover the relations\r\nexisting in common between the climatic distribution of beings and the\r\nindividuality of organic forms (in the morphology or descriptive natural\r\nhistory of plants and animals); and it is by induction that we are led to\r\ncomprehend numerical laws, the proportion of natural families to the whole\r\nnumber of species, and to designate the latitude or geographical position of\r\nthe zones in whose\r\np 61\r\nplains each organic form attains the maximum of its development.\r\nConsiderations of this nature, by their tendency to generalization, impress\r\na nobler character on the physical description of the globe, and enable us\r\nto understand how the aspect of the scenery, that is to say, the impression\r\nproduced upon the mind by the physiognomy of the vegetation, depends upon\r\nthe local distribution, the number, and the luxuriance of growth of the\r\nvegetable forms predominating in the general mass.  The catalogues of\r\norganized beings to which was formerly given the pompous title of 'Systems\r\nof Nature', present us with an admirably connected arrangement by analogies\r\nof structure, either in the perfected development of these beings, or in the\r\ndifferent phases which, in accordance with the views of a spiral evolution,\r\naffect in vegetables the leaves, bracts, calyx, corolla and fructifying\r\norgans; and in animals, with more or less symmetrical regularity, the\r\ncellular and fibrous tissues, and their perfect or but obscurely developed\r\narticulations.  But these pretended systems of nature, however ingenious\r\ntheir mode of classification may be, do not show us organic beings as they\r\nare distributed in groups throughout our planet, according to their\r\ndifferent relations of latitude and elevation above the level of the sea,\r\nand to climatic influences, which are owing to general and often very remote\r\ncauses.  The ultimate aim of physical geography is, however, as we have\r\nalready said, to recognise unity in the vast diversity of phenomena, and by\r\nthe exercise of thought and the combination of observations, to discern the\r\nconstancy of phenomena in the midst of apparent changes.  In the exposition\r\nof the terrestrial portion of the Cosmos, it will occasionally be necessary\r\nto descend to very special facts; but this will only be in order to recall\r\nthe connection existing between the actual distribution of organic beings\r\nover the globe, and the laws of the ideal classification by natural\r\nfamilies, analogy of internal organization and progressive evolution.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these discussions on the limits of the various sciences, and\r\nmore particularly from the distinction which must necessarily be made\r\nbetween descriptive botany (morphology of vegetables) and the geography of\r\nplants, that in the physical history of the globe, the innumerable multitude\r\nof organized bodies which embellish creation are considered rather according\r\nto 'zones of habitation' or 'stations', and to differently inflected\r\n'isothermal bands', than with reference to the principles of gradation in\r\nthe development of internal organism.  Notwithstanding this, botany and\r\nzoology, which constitute\r\np 62\r\nthe descriptive natural history of all organized beings, are the fruitful\r\nsources whence we draw the materials necessary to give a solid basis to the\r\nstudy of the mutual relations and connection of phenomena.\r\n\r\nWe will here subjoin one important observation by way of elucidating the\r\nconnection of which we have spoken.  The first general glance over the\r\nvegetation of a vast extent of a continent shows us forms the most\r\ndissimilar -- Graminae and Orchideae, Coniferae and oaks, in local\r\napproximation to one another; while natural families and genera, instead of\r\nbeing locally associated, are dispersed as if by chance.  This dispersion\r\nis, however, only apparent.  The physical description of the globe teaches\r\nus that vegetation every where presents numerically constant relations in\r\nthe development of its forms and types; that in the same climates, the\r\nspecies which are wanting in one country are replaced in a neighboring one\r\nby other species of the same family; and that this 'law of substitution',\r\nwhich seems to depend upon some inherent mysteries of the organism,\r\nconsidered with reference to its origin, maintains in contiguous regions a\r\nnumerical relation between the species of various great families and the\r\ngeneral mass of the phanerogamic plants constituting the two floras.  We\r\nthus revealed in the multiplicity of the distinct organizations by which\r\nthese regions are occupied; and we also discover in each zone, and\r\ndiversified according to the families of plants, a slow but continuous\r\naction on the aerial ocean, depending upon the influence of light -- the\r\nprimary condition of all organic vitality -- on the solid and liquid surface\r\nof our planet.  It might be said, in accordance with a beautiful expression\r\nof Lavoisier, that the ancient marvel of the myth of Prometheus was\r\nincessantly renewed before our eyes.\r\n\r\nIf we extend the course which we have proposed, following in the exposition\r\nof the physical description of the earth to the sidereal part of the science\r\nof the Cosmos, the delineation of the regions of space and the bodies by\r\nwhich they are occupied, we shall find our task simplified in no common\r\ndegree.  If, according to ancient but unphilosophical forms of nomenclature,\r\nwe would distinguish between 'physics', that is to say, general\r\nconsiderations on the essence of matter, and the forces by which it is\r\nactuated, and 'chemistry', which treats of the nature of substances, their\r\nelementary composition, and those attractions that are not determined solely\r\nby the relations of mass, we must admit that the description of the earth\r\ncomprises at\r\np 63\r\nonce 'physical' and 'chemical' actions.  In addition to gravitation, which\r\nmust be considered as a primitive force in nature, we observe that\r\nattractions of another kind are at work around us, both in the interior of\r\nour planet and on its surface.  These forces, to which we apply the term\r\n'chemical affinity', act upon molecules in contact, or at infinitely minute\r\ndistances from one another,* and which, being differently modified by\r\nelectricity, heat, condensation in porous bodies, or by the contact of an\r\nintermediate substance, animate equally the inorganic world and animal and\r\nvegetable tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * On the question already discussed by Newton, regarding the\r\ndifference existing between the attraction of masses and molecular\r\nattraction, see Laplace, 'Exposition du Systeme du Monde', p. 384, and\r\nsupplement to book x. of the 'Mecanique Celeste', p. 3, 4; Kant, 'Metaph.\r\nAnfangegrunde der Naturwissenschaft, Säm. Werke', 1839, bd. v., s. 309\r\n(Metaphysical Principles of the Natural Sciences); Pectet, 'Physique', 1838,\r\nvol. i., p. 59-63.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we except the small asteroids, which appear to us under the forms of\r\naerolites and shooting stars, the regions of space have hitherto presented\r\nto our direct observation physical phenomena alone; and in the case of\r\nthese, we know only with certainty the effects depending upon the\r\nquantitative relations of matter of the distribution of masses.  The\r\nphenomena of the regions of space may consequently be considered as\r\ninfluenced by simple dynamical laws -- the laws of motion.\r\n\r\nThe effects that may arise from the specific difference and the\r\nhererogeneous nature of matter have not hitherto entered into our\r\ncalculations of the mechanism of the heavens.  The only means by which the\r\ninhabitants of our planet can enter into relation with the matter contained\r\nwithin the regions of space, whether existing in scattered forms or united\r\ninto large spheroids, is by the phenomena of light, the propagation of the\r\nforce of gravitation or the attraction of masses.  The existence of a\r\nperiodical action of the sun and moon on the variations of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism is even at the present day extremely problematical.  We have no\r\ndirect experimental knowledge regarding the properties and specific\r\nqualities of the masses circulating in space, or of the matter of which they\r\nare probably composed, if we except what may be derived from the fall of\r\naerolites or meteoric stones, which, as we have already observed, enter\r\nwithin the limits of our terrestrial sphere.  It will be sufficient here to\r\nremark, that the direction and the excessive velocity of projection (a\r\nvelocity wholly planetary) manifested by these masses, render it more than\r\nprobable that\r\np 64\r\nthey are small celestial bodies, which, being attracted by our planet, are\r\nmade to deviate from their original course, and thus reach the earth\r\nenveloped in vapors, and in a high state of actual incandescence.  The\r\nfamiliar aspect of these asteroids, and the analogies which they present\r\nwith the minerals composing the earth's crust, undoubtedly afford ample\r\ngrounds for surprise,* but, in my opinion, the only conclusion to be drawn\r\nfrom these facts is that, in general, planets and other sidereal masses,\r\nwhich by the influence of a central body, have been agglomerated into rings\r\nof vapor, and subsequently into spheroids, being integrant parts of the same\r\nsystem, and having one common origin, may likewise be composed of substances\r\nchemically identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  I[The analysis of an aerolite which fell a few years since in\r\nMaryland, United States, and was examined by Professor Silliman, of New\r\nHaven, Connecticut, gave the following results:  Oxyd of iron, 24; oxyd of\r\nnickel, 1.25; silica, with earthy matter, 3.46; sulphur, a trace - 28.71.\r\nDr. Mantell's 'Wonders of Geology', 1848, vol. i., p. 51.] -- 'Tr.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, experiments with the pendulum, particularly those prosecuted with\r\nsuch rare precision by Bessel, confirm the Newtonian axiom, that bodies the\r\nmost heterogeneous in their nature (as water, gold, quartz, granular\r\nlimestone, and different masses of aerolites) experience a perfectly similar\r\ndegree of acceleration from the attraction of the earth.  To the experiments\r\nof the pendulum may be added the proofs furnished by purely astronomical\r\nobservations.  The almost perfect identity of the mass of Jupiter, deduced\r\nfrom the influence exercised by this stupendous planet on its own\r\nsatellites, on Enck's comet of short period, and on the small planets Vesta,\r\nJuno, Ceres, and Pallas, indicates with equal certainty that within the\r\nlimits of actual observation attraction is determined solely by the quantity\r\nof matter.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *Poisson, 'Connaissances des Temps pour l'Anne' 1836, p. 64-66.\r\nBessel, Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd. xxv., s. 417.  Encke, 'Abhandlungen der\r\nBerliner Academie' (Trans. of the Berlin Academy), 1826, s. 257.\r\nMitscherlich, 'Lehrbuch der Chemie' (Manual of Chemistry), 1837 bd. i. s.\r\n352.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis absence of any perceptible difference in the nature of matter, alike\r\nproved by direct observation and theoretical deductions, imparts a high\r\ndegree of simplicity to the mechanism of the heavens.  The immeasurable\r\nextent of the regions of space being subjected to laws of motion alone, the\r\nsidereal portion of the science of the Cosmos is based on the pure and\r\nabundant source of mathematical astronomy, as is the terrestrial portion on\r\nphysics, chemistry, and organic morphology; but the domain of these three\r\nlast-named sciences embraces\r\np 65\r\nthe consideration of phenomena which are so complicated and have, up to the\r\npresent time, been found so little susceptible of the application of\r\nrigorous method, that the physical science of the earth can not boast of the\r\nsame certainty and simplicity in the exposition of facts and their mutual\r\nconnection which characterize the celestial portion of the Cosmos.  It is\r\nnot improbable that the difference to which we allude may furnish an\r\nexplanation of the cause which, in the earliest ages of intellectual culture\r\namong the Greeks, directed the natural philosophy of the Pythagoreans with\r\nmore ardor to the heavenly bodies and the regions of space than to the earth\r\nand its productions, and how through Philolaus, and subsequently through the\r\nanalogous views of Aristarchus of Samos, and of Seleucus of Erythrea, this\r\nscience has been made more conducive to the attainment of a knowledge of the\r\ntrue system of the world than the natural philosophy of the Ionian school\r\ncould ever be to the physical history of the earth.  Giving but little\r\nattention to the properties and specific differences of matter filling\r\nspace, the great Italian school, in its Doric gravity, turned by preference\r\ntoward all that relates to measure, to the form of bodies, and to the number\r\nand distances of the planets,* while the Ionian physicists directed their\r\nattention to the qualities of matter, its true or supposed metamorphoses,\r\nand to relations of origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *Compare Otfried Muller's 'Dorien', bd. i., s. 365.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the powerful genius of Aristotle, alike profoundly\r\nspeculative and practical to sound with equal success the depths of\r\nabstraction and the inexhaustible resources of vital activity pervading the\r\nmaterial world.\r\n\r\nSeveral highly distinguished treatises on physical geography are prefaced by\r\nan introduction, whose purely astronomical sections are directed to the\r\nconsideration of the earth in its planetary dependence, and as constituting\r\na part of that great system which is animated by one central body, the sun.\r\nThis course is diametrically opposed to the one which I propose following.\r\nIn order adequately to estimate the dignity of the Cosmos, it is requisite\r\nthat the sidereal portion, termed by Kant the 'natural history of the\r\nheavens', should not be made subordinate to the terrestrial.  In the science\r\nof the Cosmos, according to the expression of Aristarchus of Samos, the\r\npioneer of the Copernican system, the sun, with its satellites, was nothing\r\nmore than one of the innumerable stars by which space is occupied.  The\r\nphysical history of the world must, therefore, begin with the description of\r\nthe heavenly bodies,\r\np 66\r\nand with a geographical sketch of the universe, or, I would rather say, a\r\ntrue 'map of th world', such as was traced by the bold hand of the elder\r\nHerschel.  If, notwithstanding the smallness of our planet, the most\r\nconsiderable space and the most attentive consideration be here afforded to\r\nthat which exclusively concerns it, this arises solely from the\r\ndisproportion in the extent of our knowledge of that which is accessible and\r\nof that which is closed to our observation.  This subordination of the\r\ncelestial to the terrestrial portion is met with in the great work of\r\nBernard Varenius,* which appeared in the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *'Geographia Generalis in qua affectiones generales telluris\r\nexplicantur.'  The oldest Elzevir edition bears date 1650, the second 1672,\r\nand the third 1681; these were published at Cambridge, under Newton's\r\nsupervision.  This excellent work by Varenius is, in the true sense of the\r\nwords, a physical description of the earth.  Since the work 'Historia\r\nNatural de las Indias', 1590, in which the Jesuit Joseph de Acosta sketched\r\nin so masterly a manner the delineation of the New Continent, questions\r\nrelating to the physical history of the earth have never been considered\r\nwith such admirable generality.  Acosta is richer in original observations,\r\nwhile Varenius embraces a wider circle of ideas, since his sojourn in\r\nHolland, which was at that period the center of vast commercial relations,\r\nhad brought him in contact with a great number of well-iinformed travelers.\r\n'Generalis sive Universalis Geographia dictur quae tellurem in genere\r\nconsiderat atque affectiones explicat, non habita particularium regionum\r\nratione.'  The general description of the earth by Varenius ('Pars\r\nAbsoluta', cap. i.-xxii.) may be considered as a treatise of comparative\r\ngeography, if we adopt the term used by the author himself ('Geographia\r\nComparativa', cap. xxxiii.-xl.), although this must be understood in a\r\nlimited acceptation.  We may cite the following among the most remarkable\r\npassages of this book:  the enumeration of the systems of mountains; the\r\nexamination of the relations existing between their directions and the\r\ngeneral form of continents (p. 66, 76, ed. Cantab., 1681); a list of extinct\r\nvolcanoes, and such as were still in a state of activity; the discussion of\r\nfacts relative to the general distribution of islands and archipelagoes (p.\r\n220); the depth of the ocean relatively to the height of neighboring coasts\r\n(p. 103); the uniformity of level observed in all open seas (p. 97); the\r\ndependence of currents on the prevailing winds; the unequal saltness of the\r\nsea; the configuration of shores (p. 139); the direction of the winds as the\r\nresult of differences of temperature, etc.  We may further instance the\r\nremarkable considerations of Varenius regarding the equinoctial current from\r\neast to west, to which he attributes the origin of the Gulf Stream,\r\nbeginning at Cape St. Augustin, and issuing forth between Cuba and Florida\r\n(p. 140).  Nothing can be more accurate than his description of the current\r\nwhich skirts the western coast of Africa, between Cape Verde and the island\r\nof Fernando Po in the Gulf of Guinea.  Varenius explains the formation of\r\nsporadic islands by supposing them to be \"the raised bottom of the sea:\"\r\n'magna spirituum inclusorum vi, sicut aliquando montes e terra protusos esse\r\nquidam scribunt' (p. 225).  The edition published by Newton in 1681\r\n('auctior et emendatior' unfortunately contains no additions from this great\r\nauthority; and there is not even mention made of the polar compression of\r\nthe globe, although the experiments on the pendulum by Richer had been made\r\nnine years prior to the appearance of the Cambridge edition.  Newton's\r\n'Principia Mathematica Philosophie Naturalis' were not communicated in\r\nmanuscript to the Royal Society until April, 1686.  Much uncertainty seems\r\nto prevail regarding the birth-place of Varenius.  Jaecher says it was\r\nEngland, while, according to 'La Biographie Universelle' (b.xlvii., p. 495),\r\nhe is stated to have been born at Amsterdam; but it would appear, from the\r\ndedicatory address to the burgomaster of that city (see his 'Geographia\r\nComparativa', that both suppositions are false.  Varenius expressly says\r\nthat he had sought refuge in Amsterdam, \"because his native city had been\r\nburned and completely destroyed during a long war,\" words which appear to\r\napply to the north of Germany, and to the devastations of the Thirty Years'\r\nWar.  In his dedication of another work, 'Descriptio regni Japoniae' (Amst.,\r\n1649), to the Senate of Hamburgh, Varenius says that he prosecuted his\r\nelementary mathematical studies in the gymnasium of that city.  There is,\r\ntherefore, every reason to believe that this admirable geographer was a\r\nnative of Germany, and was probably born at Luneburg ('Witten. Mem. Theol.',\r\n1685, p. 2142; Zedler, 'Universal Lexicon', vol. xlvi., 1745, p. 187).\r\n\r\np 67\r\nHe was the first to distinguish between 'general and special geography', the\r\nformer of which he subdivides into an 'absolute', or, properly speaking,\r\n'terrestrial' part, and a 'relative or planetary' portion, according to the\r\nmode of considering our planet either with reference to its surface in its\r\ndifferent zones, or to its relations to the sun and moon.  It redounds to\r\nthe glory of Varenius that his work on 'General and Comparative Geography'\r\nshould in so high a degree have arrested the attention of Newton.  The\r\nimperfect state of many of the auxiliary sciences from which this writer was\r\nobliged to draw his materials prevented his work from corresponding to the\r\ngreatness of the design, and it was reserved for the present age, and for my\r\nown country, to see the delineation of comparative geography, drawn in its\r\nfull extent, and in all its relations with the history of man, by the\r\nskillful hand of Carl Ritter.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *Carl Ritter's 'Erdkunde im Verhältniss zur Natur und zur\r\nGeschichte des Menschen, oder allgemeine vergleichende Geographie'\r\n(Geography in relation to Nature and the History of Man, or general\r\nComparative Geography).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of the most important results of the astronomical and\r\nphysical sciences which in the history of the Cosmos radiate toward one\r\ncommon focus, may perhaps, to a certain degree, justify the designation I\r\nhave given to my work, and, considered within the circumscribed limits I\r\nhave proposed to myself, the undertaking may be esteemed less adventurous\r\nthan the title.  The introduction of new terms, especially with reference to\r\nthe general results of a science which\r\np 68\r\nought to be accessible to all, has always been greatly in opposition to my\r\nown practice; and whenever I have enlarged upon the established\r\nnomenclature, it has only been in the specialities of descriptive botany and\r\nzoology, where the introduction of hitherto unknown objects rendered new\r\nnames necessary.  The denominations of physical descriptions of the\r\nuniverse, or physical cosmography, which I use indiscriminantely, have been\r\nmodeled upon those of 'physical descriptions of the earth', that is to say,\r\n'physical geography', terms that have long been in common use.  Descartes,\r\nwhose genius was one of the most powerful manifested in any age, has left us\r\na few fragments of a great work, which he intended publishing under the\r\ntitle of 'Monde', and for which he had prepared hiimself by special studies,\r\nincluding even that of human anatomy.  The uncommon, but definite expression\r\nof the 'science of the Cosmos' recalls to the mind of the inhabitant of the\r\nearth that we are treating of a more widely-extended horizon -- of the\r\nassemblage of all things with which space is filled, from the remotest\r\nnebulae to the climatic distribution of those delicate tissues of vegetable\r\nmatter which spread a variegated covering over the surface of our rocks.\r\n\r\nThe influence of narrow-minded views peculiar to the earlier ages of\r\ncivilization led in all languages to a confusion of ideas in the synonymic\r\nuse of the words 'earth' and 'world', while the common expressions 'voyages\r\nround the world', 'map of the world', and 'new world', afford further\r\nillustrations of the same confusion.  The  more noble and precisely-defined\r\nexpressions of 'system of the world', 'the planetary world', and 'creation\r\nand age of the world', relate either to the totality of the substances by\r\nwhich space is filled, or to the origin of the whole universe.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that, in the midst of the extreme variability of phenomena\r\npresented by the surface of our globe, and the aerial ocean by which it is\r\nsurrounded, man should have been impressed by the aspect of the vault of\r\nheaven, and the uniform and regular movements of the sun and planets.  Thus\r\nthe word Cosmos, which primitively, in the Homeric ages, indicated an idea\r\nof order and harmony, was subsequently adopted in scientific language, where\r\nit was gradually applied to the order observed in the movements of the\r\nheavenly bodies, to the whole universe, and then finally to the world in\r\nwhich this harmony was reflected to us.  According to the assertion of\r\nPhilolaus, whose fragmentary works have been so ably commented upon by\r\nBöckh, and conformably to the general testimony\r\np 69\r\nof antiquity, Pythagoras was the first who used the word Cosmos to designate\r\nthe order that reigns in the universe, or entire world.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[Greek word], in the most ancient, and at the same time most\r\nprecise, definition of the word, signified 'ornament' (as an adornment for a\r\nman, a woman, or a horse); taken figuratively for [Greek word], it implied\r\nthe order or adornment of a discourse.  According to the testimony of all\r\nthe ancients, it was Pythagoras who first used the word to designate the\r\norder in the universe, and the universe itself.  Pythagoras left no\r\nwritings; but ancient attestation to the truth of this assertion is to be\r\nfound in several passages of the fragmentary works of Philolaus (Stob.,\r\n'Eclog.', p. 360 and 460, Heeren), p. 62, 90, in Bockh's German edition.  I\r\ndo not, according to the example of Nake, cite Timof Locris, since his\r\nauthenticity is doubtful.  Plutarch ('De plac. Phil.', ii., I) says, in the\r\nmost express manner, that Pythatoras gave the name of Cosmos to the universe\r\non account of the order which reigned throughout it; so likewise does Galen\r\n('Hist. Phil.', p. 429).  This word, together with its novel signification,\r\npassed from the schools of philosophy into the language of poets and prose\r\nwriters.  Plato designates the heavenly bodies by the name of 'Uranos', but\r\nthe order pervading the regions of space he too terms the Cosmos, and in his\r\n'Timus' (p. 30 a.) he says 'that the world is an animal endowed with a soul'\r\n [Greek words].  Compare Anaxag. Claz., ed. Schaubach, p. III, and Plut.\r\n('De plac. Phil.', in Aristotle ('De Caelo', I, 9), 'Cosmos' signifies \"the\r\nuniverse and the order pervading it,\" but it is likewise considered as\r\ndivided in space into two parts -- the sublunary world, and the world above\r\nthe moon.  ('Meteor.', I., w, 1, and I., 3, 13, p. 339, 'a', and 340, 'b',\r\nBekk.)  The definition of Cosmos, which I have already cited is taken from\r\nPseudo-Aristoteles 'de Mundo', cap. ii. (p. 391); the passage referred to is\r\nas follows:  [Greek words].  Most of the passages occurring in Greek writers\r\non the word 'Cosmos' may be found collected together in the controversy\r\nbetween Richard Bentley and Charles Boyle ('Opuscula Philologica', 1781, p.\r\n347, 445; 'Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris', 1817, p. 254); on\r\nthe historical existence of Zaleucus, legislator of Leucris, in Nake's\r\nexcellent work, 'Sched. Crit.', 1812, p. 9, 15; and, finally in Theophilus\r\nSchmidt, 'ad Cleom. Cycl. Theor.', met. I., 1, p. ix., 1 and 99.  Taken in a\r\nmore limited sense, the word Cosmos is also used in the plural (Plut., 1,\r\n5), either to designate the stars (Stob., 1, p. 514; Plut., 11, 13) or the\r\ninnumerable systems scattered like islands through the immensity of space,\r\nand each composed of a sun and a moon.  (Anax. Claz., 'Fragm.', p. 89, 93,\r\n120; Brandis, 'Gesch. der Griechisch-Römischen Philosophie', b. i., s. 252\r\n(History of the Greco-Roman Philosophy).  Each of these groups forming thus\r\na 'Cosmos', the universe, [Greek words], the word must be understood in a\r\nwider sense (Plut., ii., 1).  It was not until long after the time of the\r\nPtolemies that the word was applied to the earth.  Bockh has made known\r\ninscriptions in praise of Trajan and Adrian ('Corpus Inscr. Graec.', I, n.\r\n334 and 1036), in which [Greek word] occurs for [Greek word] in the same\r\nmanner as we still use the term 'world' to signify the earth alone.  We have\r\nalready mentioned the singular division of the regions of space\r\np 70  [Footnote continues]\r\ninto three parts, the 'Olympus, Cosmos' and 'Ouranos' (Stob., i., p. 488;\r\nPhilolaus, p. 95, 303);  this division applies to the different regions\r\nsurrounding that mysterious focus of the universe, the [Greek words] of the\r\nPythagoreans.  In the fragmentary passage in which this division is found,\r\nthe term [Greek word] designates the innermost region, situated between the\r\nmoon and earth; this is the domain of changing things.  The middle region,\r\nwhere the planets circulate in an invariable and harmonious order, is, in\r\naccordance with the special conceptions entertained of the universe,\r\nexclusively termed 'Cosmos', while the word 'Olympus' is used to express the\r\nexterior or igneous region.  Bopp, the profound philologist, has remarked\r\nthat we may deduce, as Pott has done, 'Etymol. Forschungen', th.i., s. 39\r\nand 252 ('Etymol. Researches'), the word [Greek word]  from the Sanscrit\r\nroot 'sud', 'purificari', by assuming two conditions; first that the Greek\r\nletter 'kappa' in [Greek word] comes from the palatial 'epsilon', which Bopp\r\nrepresents by 's' and Pott by 'ç' (in the same manner as [Greek word],\r\n'decem, taihun' in Gothic, comes from the Indian word 'dasan'), and, next,\r\nthat the Indian 'd'' corresponds, as a general rule, with the Greek 'theta'\r\n('Vergleichende Grammatik' 99 -- Comparative Grammar), which shows the\r\nrelation of [Greek word] (for [Greek word]) with the Sanscrit root 'sud',\r\nwhence is also derived [Greek word].  Another Indian term for the world is\r\n'gagat' (pronounced 'dschagat'), which is, properly speaking the present\r\nparticiple of the verb 'gagami' (I go), the root of which is 'ga.'  In\r\nrestricting ourselves to the circle of Hellenic etymologies, we find\r\n('Etymol. M.', p. 532, 12) that [Greek word] is intimately associated with\r\n[Greek word] or rather with [Greek word], whence we have [Greek word] or\r\n[Greek word]  Welcker ('Eine Kretische Col in Theben', s. 23 -- A Cretan\r\nColony in Thebes) combines with this the name [Greek word] , as in Hesychius\r\n[Greek word] signifies a Cretan suit of arms.  When the scientific language\r\nof Greece was introduced among the Romans, the word 'mundus', which at first\r\nhad only the primary meaning of [Greek word] (female ornament), was applied\r\nto designate the entire universe.  Ennius seems to have been the first who\r\nventured upon this innovation.  In one of the fragments of this poet,\r\npreserved by Macrobius, on the occasion of his quarrel with Virgil, we find\r\nthe word used in its novel mode of acceptation: \"Mundus caeli vastus\r\nconstitit silentio\" (Sat., vi., 2).  Cicero also says, \"Quem nos lucentem\r\nmundum vocamus\" (Timæus, 'S.de univer.', cap. x.)  The Sanscrit root 'mand'\r\nfrom which Pott derives the Latin 'mundus' ('Etym. Forsch.', th. i., s.\r\n240), combines the double signification of shining and adorning.  'Loka'\r\ndesignates in Sanscrit the world and people in general, in the same manner\r\nas the French word 'monde', and is derived according to Bopp, from 'lok' (to\r\nsee and shine); it is the same with the Slavonic root 'swjet', which means\r\nboth 'light' and 'world.'  (Grimm, 'Deutsche Gramm.', b. iii., s. 394 --\r\nGerman Grammar.)  The word 'welt', which the Germans make use of at the\r\npresent day, and which was 'weralt' in old German, 'worold' in old Saxon,\r\nand 'weruld' in Anglo-Saxon, was, according to James Grimm's interpretation,\r\na period of time, an age ('saeculum') rather than a term used for the world\r\nin space.  The Etruscans figured to themselves 'mundus' as an inverted dome,\r\nsymmetrically opposed to the celestial vault (Otfried Muller's 'Etrusken',\r\nth. ii., s. 96, etc.).  Taken in a still more limited sense, the word\r\nappears to have signified among the Goths the terrestrial surface girded by\r\nseas ('marei, meri',) the 'merigard', literally, 'garden of seas.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Italian school of philosophy, the expression passed, in this\r\nsignification, into the language of those early poets\r\np 71\r\nof nature, Parmenides and Empedocles, and from thence into the works of\r\nprose writers.  We will not here enter into a discussion of the manner in\r\nwhich, according to the Pythagorean views, Philolaus distinguishes between\r\nOlympus, Uranus, or the heavens, and Cosmos, or how the same word, used in a\r\nplural sense, could be applied to certain heavenly bodies (the planets)\r\nrevolving round one central focus of the world, or to groups of stars.  In\r\nthis work I use the word Cosmos in conformity with the Hellenic usage of the\r\nterm subsequently to the time of Pythagorus, and in accordance with the\r\nprecise definition given of it in the treatise entitled 'De Mundo', which\r\nwas long erroneously attributed to Aristotle.  It is the assemblage of all\r\nthings in heaven and earth, the universality of created things constituting\r\nthe perceptible world.  If scientific terms had not long been diverted from\r\ntheir true verbal signification, the present work ought rather to have borne\r\nthe title of 'Cosmography', divided into 'Uranography' and 'Geography.'  The\r\nRomans, in their feeble essays on philosophy, imitated the Greeks by\r\napplying to the universe the term 'mundus', which, in its primary meaning,\r\nindicated nothing more than ornament, and did not even imply order or\r\nregularity in the disposition of parts.  It is probable that the\r\nintroduction into the language of Latium of this technical term as an\r\nequivalent for Cosmos, in its double signification, is due to Ennius,* who\r\nwas a follower of the Italian school, and the translator of the writings of\r\nEpicharmus and some of his pupils on the Pythagorean philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See, on Ennius, the ingenious researches of Leopold Krahner, in\r\nhis 'Grundlinien zur Geschichte des Verfalls der Romischen Staats-Reigion',\r\n1837, s. 41-45 (Outlines of the History of the Decay of the Established\r\nReligion among the Romans).  In all probability, Ennius did not quote from\r\nwritings of Epicharmus himself, but from poems composed in the name of that\r\nphilosopher, and in accordance with his views.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would first distinguish between the physical 'history' and the physical\r\n'description' of the world.  The former, conceived in the most general sense\r\nof the word, ought, if materials for writing it existed, to trace the\r\nvariations experienced by the universe in the course of ages from the new\r\nstars which have suddenly appeared and disappeared in the vault of heaven,\r\nfrom nebulæ dissolving or condensing -- to the first stratum of cryptogamic\r\nvegetation on the still imperfectly cooled surface of the earth, or on a\r\nreef of coral uplifted from the depths of ocean.  'The physical description\r\nof the world' presents a picture of all that exists in space -- of the\r\nsiimultaneous action of\r\np 72\r\nnatural forces, together with the phenomena which they produce.\r\n\r\nBut if we would correctly comprehend nature, we must not entirely or\r\nabsolutely separate the consideration of the present state of things from\r\nthat of the successive phases through which they have passed.  We can not\r\nform a just conception of their nature without looking back on the mode of\r\ntheir formation.  It is not organic matter alone that is continually\r\nundergoing change, and being dissolved to form new combinations.  The globe\r\nitself reveals at every phase of its existence the mystery of its former\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWe can not survey the crust of our planet without recognizing the traces of\r\nthe prior existence and destruction of an organic world.  The sedimentary\r\nrocks present a succession of organic forms, associated in groups, which\r\nhave successively displaced and succeeded each other.  The different\r\nsuper-imposed strata thus display to us the faunas and floras of different\r\nepochs.  In this sense the description of nature is intimately connected\r\nwith its history; and the geologist, who is guided by the connection\r\nexisting among the facts observed, can not form a conception of the present\r\nwithout pursuing, through countless ages, the history of the past.  In\r\ntracing the physical delineation of the globe, we behold the present and the\r\npast reciprocally incorporated, as it were, with one another; for the domain\r\nof nature is like that of languages, in which etymological research reveals\r\na successive development, by showing us the primary condition of an idiom\r\nreflected in the forms of speech in use at the present day.  The study of\r\nthe material world renders this reflection of the past peculiarly manifest,\r\nby displaying in the process of formation rocks of eruption and sedimentary\r\nstrata similar to those of former ages.  If I may be allowed to borrow a\r\nstriking illustration from the geological relations by which the physiognomy\r\nof a country is determined, I would say that domes of trachyte, cones of\r\nbasalt, lava streams ('coules')of amygdaloid with elongated and parallel\r\npores, and white deposits of pumice, intermixed with black scoriae, animate\r\nthe scenery by the associations of the past which they awaken, acting upon\r\nthe imagination of the enlightened observer like traditional records of an\r\nearlier world.  Their form is their history.\r\n\r\nThe sense in which the Greeks and Romans originally employed the word\r\n'history' proves that they too were intimately convinced that, to form a\r\ncomplete idea of the present state of the universe, it was necessary to\r\nconsider it in its successive\r\np 73\r\nphases.  It is not, however, in the definition given by Valerius Flaccus,*\r\nbut in the zoological writings of Aristotle, that the word 'history'\r\npresents itself as an exposition of the results of experience and\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote] *Aul. Gell., 'Nect. Att.', v., 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe physical description of the word by Pliny the elder bears the title of\r\n'Natural History', while in the letters of his nephew it is designated by\r\nthe nobler term of 'History of Nature.'  The earlier Greek historians did\r\nnot separate the description of countries from the narrative of events of\r\nwhich they had been the theater.  With these writers, physical geography and\r\nhistory were long intimately associated, and remained simply but elegantly\r\nblended until the period of the development of political interests, when the\r\nagitation in which the lives of men were passed caused the geographical\r\nportion to be banished from the history of nations, and raised into an\r\nindependent science.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be considered whether by the operation of thought, we may hope\r\nto reduce the immense diversity of phenomena comprised by the Cosmos to the\r\nunity of a principle, and the evidence afforded by rational truths.  In the\r\npresent state of empirical knowledge, we can scarcely flatter ourselves with\r\nsuch a hope.  Experimental sciences, based on the observation of the\r\nexternal world, can not aspire to completeness; the nature of things, and\r\nthe imperfection of our organs, are alike opposed to it.  We shall never\r\nsucceed in exhausting the immeasurable riches of nature; and no generation\r\nof men will ever have cause to boast of having comprehended the total\r\naggregation of phenomena.  It is only by distributing them into groups that\r\nwe have been able, in the case of a few, to discover the empire of certain\r\nnatural laws, grand and simple as nature itself.  The extent of this empire\r\nwill no doubt increase in proportion as physical sciences are more perfectly\r\ndeveloped.  Striking proofs of this advancement have been made manifest in\r\nour own day, in the phenomena of electro-magnetism, the propagation of\r\nluminous waves and radiating heat.  In the same manner, the fruitful\r\ndoctrine of evolution shows us how, in organic development, all that is\r\nformed is sketched out beforehand, and how the tissues of vegetable and\r\nanimal matter uniformly arise from the multiplication and transformation of\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nThe generalization of laws, which, being at first bounded by narrow limits,\r\nhad been applied solely to isolated groups of phenomena, acquires in time\r\nmore marked gradations, and gains in extent and certainty as long as the\r\nprocess of reasoning\r\np 74\r\nis applied strictly to analogous phenomena; but as soon as dynamical views\r\nprove insufficient where the specific properties and heterogeneous nature of\r\nmatter come into play; it is to be feared that, by persisting in the pursuit\r\nof laws, we may find our course suddenly arrested by an impassible chasm.\r\nThe principle of unity is lost sight of, and the guiding clew is rent\r\nasunder whenever any specific and peculiar kind of action manifests itself\r\namid the active forces of nature.  The law of equivalents and the numerical\r\nproportions of composition, so happily recognized by modern chemists, and\r\nproclaimed under the ancient form of atomic symbols, still remains isolated\r\nand independent of mathematicl laws of motion and gravitation.\r\n\r\nThose productions of nature which are objects of direct observation may be\r\nlogically distributed in classes, orders, and families.  This form of\r\ndistribution undoubtedly sheds some light on descriptive natural history,\r\nbut the study of organized bodies, considered in their linear connection,\r\nalthough it may impart a greater degree of unity and simplicity to the\r\ndistribution of groups, can not rise to the height of a classification based\r\non one sole principle of composition and internal organization.  As\r\ndifferent gradations are presented by the laws of nature according to the\r\nextent of the horizon, or the limits of the phenomena to be considered, so\r\nthere are likewise differently graduated phases in the investigation of the\r\nexternal world.  Empiricism originates in isolated views, which are\r\nsubsequently grouped according to their analogy or dissimilarity.  To direct\r\nobservation succeeds, although long afterward, the wish to prosecute\r\nexperiments; that is to say, to evoke phenomena under different determined\r\nconditions.  The rational experimentalist does not proceed at hazard, but\r\nacts under the guidance of hypotheses, founded on a half indistinct and more\r\nor less just intuition of the connection existing among natural objects or\r\nforces.  That which has been conquered by observation or by means of\r\nexperiments, leads, by analysis and induction, to the discovery of empirical\r\nlaws.  These are the phases in human intellect that have marked the\r\ndifferent epochs in the life of nations, and by means of which that great\r\nmass of facts has been accumulated which constitutes at the present day the\r\nsolid basis of the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nTwo forms of abstraction conjointly regulate our knowledge, namely,\r\nrelations of 'quantity', comprising ideas of number and size, and relations\r\nof 'quality', embracing the consideration of the specific properties and the\r\nheterogeneous nature\r\np 75\r\nof matter.  The former, as being more accessible to the exercise of thought,\r\nappertains to mathematics; the latter, from the apparent mysteries and\r\ngreater difficulties, falls under the domain of the chemical sciences.  In\r\norder to submit phenomena to calculation, recourse is had to a hypothetical\r\nconstruction of matter by a combination of molecules and atoms, whose\r\nnumber, form, position, and polarity determine, modify, or vary phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe mythical ideas long entertained of the imponderable substances and vital\r\nforces peculiar to each mode of organization, have complicated our views\r\ngenerally, and shed an uncertain light on the path we ought to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe most various forms of intuition have thus, age after age, aided in\r\naugmenting the prodigious mass of empirical knowledge, which, in our own day\r\nhas been enlarged with ever-increasing rapidity.  The investigating spirit\r\nof man strives from time to time, with varying success, to break through\r\nthose ancient forms and symbols invented, to subject rebellious matter to\r\nrules of mechanical construction.\r\n\r\nWe are still very far from the time when it will be possible for us to\r\nreduce, by the operation of thought, all that we perceive by the senses, to\r\nthe unity of a rational principle.  It may even be doubted if such a victory\r\ncould ever be achieved in the field of natural philosophy.  The complication\r\nof phenomena, and of the vast extent of the Cosmos, would seem to oppose\r\nsuch a result; but even a partial solution of the problem -- the tendency\r\ntoward a comprehension of the phenomena of the universe -- will not the less\r\nremain the eternal and sublime aim of every investigation of nature.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the character of my former writings, as well as with the\r\nlabors in which I have been engaged during my scientific career, in\r\nmeasurements, experiments, and the investigation of facts, I limit myself to\r\nthe domain of empirical ideas.\r\n\r\nThe exposition of mutually connected facts does not exclude the\r\nclassification of phenomena according to their rational connection, the\r\ngeneralization of many specialities in the great mass of observations, or\r\nthe attempt to discover laws.  Conceptions of the universe solely based upon\r\nreason, and the principles of speculative philosophy, would no doubt assign\r\na still more exalted aim to the science of the Cosmos.  I am far from\r\nblaming the efforts of others solely because their success has hitherto\r\nremained very doubtful.  Contrary to the wishes and counsel of of those\r\nprofound and powerful thinkers who\r\np 76\r\nhave given new life to speculations which were already familiar to the\r\nancients, systems of natural philosophy have in our own country for some\r\ntime past turned aside the minds of men from the graver study of\r\nmathematical and physical sciences.  The abuse of better powers, which has\r\nled many of our noble but ill-judging youth into the saturnalia of a purely\r\nideal science of nature, has been signalized by the intoxication of\r\npretended conquests, by a novel and fantastically symbolical phraseology,\r\nand by a predilection for the formulae of a scholastic rationalism, more\r\ncontracted in its views than any known to the Middle Ages.  I use the\r\nexpression \"abuse of better powers,\" because superior intellects devoted to\r\nphilosophical pursuits and experimental sciences have remained strangers to\r\nthese saturnalia.  The results yielded by an earnest investigation in the\r\npath of experiment can not be at variance with a true philosophy of nature.\r\nIf there be any contradiction, the fault must lie either in the unsoundness\r\nof speculation, or in the exaggerated pretensions of empiricism, which\r\nthinks that more is proved by experiment than is actually derivable from it.\r\n\r\nExternal nature may be opposed to the intellectual world, as if the latter\r\nwere not comprised within the limits of the former, or nature may be opposed\r\nto art when the latter is defined as a manifestation of the intellectual\r\npower of man; but these contrasts, which we find reflected in the most\r\ncultivated languages, must not lead us to separate the sphere of nature from\r\nthat of mind, since such a separation would reduce the physical science of\r\nthe world to a mere aggregation of empirical specialities.  Science does not\r\npresent itself to man until mind conquers matter in striving to subject the\r\nresult of experimental investigation to rational combinations.  Science is\r\nthe labor of mind applied to nature, but the external world has no real\r\nexistence for us beyond the image reflected within ourselves through the\r\nmedium of the senses.  As intelligence and forms of speech, thought and its\r\nverbal symbols, are united by secret and indissoluble links, so does the\r\nexternal world blend almost unconsciously to ourselves with our ideas and\r\nfeelings.  \"External phenomena,\" says Hegel, in his 'Philosophy of History',\r\n\"are in some degree translated in our inner representations.\"  The objective\r\nworld, conceived and reflected within us by thought, is subjected to the\r\neternal and necessary conditions of our intellectual being.  The activity of\r\nthe mind exercises itself on the elements furnished to it by the perceptions\r\nof the senses.  Thus, in the\r\np 77\r\nearly ages of mankind, there manifests itself in the simple intuition of\r\nnatural facts, and in the efforts made to comprehend them, the germ of the\r\nphilosophy of nature.  These ideal tendencies vary, and are more or less\r\npowerful, according to the individual characteristics and moral dispositions\r\nof nations, and to the degrees of their mental culture, whether attained\r\namid scenes of nature that excite or chill the imagination.\r\n\r\nHistory has preserved the record of the numerous attempts that have been\r\nmade to form a rational conception of the whole world of phenomena, and to\r\nrecognize in the universe the action of one sole active force by which\r\nmatter is penetrated, transformed, and animated.  These attempts are traced\r\nin classical antiquity in those treatises on the principles of things which\r\nemanated from the Ionian school, and in which all the phenomena of nature\r\nwere subjected to hazardous speculations, based upon a small number of\r\nobservations.  By degrees, as the influence of great historical events has\r\nfavored the development of every branch of science supported by observation,\r\nthat ardor has cooled which formerly led men to seek the essential nature\r\nand connection of things by ideal construction and in purely rational\r\nprinciples.  In recent times, the mathematical portion of natural philosophy\r\nhas been most remarkably and admirably enlarged.  The method and the\r\ninstrument (analysis) have been simultaneously perfected.  That which has\r\nbeen acquired by means so different -- by the ingenious application of\r\natomic suppositions, by the more general and intimate study of phenomena,\r\nand by the improved construction of new apparatus -- is the common property\r\nof mankind, and shouldnot, in our opinion, now, more than in ancient times,\r\nbe withdrawn from the free exercise of speculative thought.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied that in this process of thought, the results of\r\nexperience have had to contend with many disadvantages; we must not,\r\ntherefore, be surprised if, in the perpetual vicissitude of theoretical\r\nviews, as is ingeniously expressed by the author of 'Giordano Bruno', \"most\r\nmen see nothing in philosophy but a succession of passing meteors, while\r\neven the grander forms in which she has revealed herself share the fate of\r\ncomets, bodies that do not rank in popular opinion among the eternal and\r\npermanent works of nature,\r\np 78\r\nbut are regarded as mere fugitive apparitions of igncor vapor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote]  *Schelling's Bruno, 'eber das Gottliche und Naturaliche Princip.\r\nder Dinge', 181 (Bruno, on the 'Divine and Natural Principle of Things')\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would here remark that the abuse of thought, and the false track it too\r\noften pursues, ought not to sanction an opinion derogatory to the intellect,\r\nwhich would imply that the domain of mind is essentially a world of vague\r\nfantastic illusions, and that the treasures accumulated by laborious\r\nobservations in philosophy are powers hostile to its own empire.  It does\r\nnot become the spirit which characterizes the present age distrustfully to\r\nreject every generalization of views and every attempt to examine into the\r\nnature of things by the process of reason and induction.  It would be a\r\ndenial of the dignity of human nature and the relative importance of the\r\nfaculties with which we are endowed, were we to condemn at one time austere\r\nreason engaged in investigating causes and their natural connections, and at\r\nanother that exercise of the imagination which prompts and excites\r\ndiscoveries by its creative powers.\r\n\r\nThis material taken from pages 79 to 111\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSMOS: A Sketch of the Physical Description of the Universe, Vol. 1\r\nby Alexander von Humboldt\r\n\r\nTranslated by E C Otte\r\n\r\nfrom the 1858 Harper & Brothers edition of Cosmos, volume 1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\np 79\r\n\r\nCOSMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nDELINEATION OF NATURE.  GENERAL REVIEW OF NATURAL PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nWHEN the human mind first attempts to subject to its control the world of\r\nphysical phenomena, and strives by meditative contemplation to penetrate the\r\nrich luxuriance of living nature, and the mingled web of free and restricted\r\nnatural forces, man feels himself raised to a height from whence, as he\r\nembraces the vast horizon, individual things blend together in varied\r\ngroups, and appear as if shrouded in a vapory\r\n vail.  These figurative expressions are used in order to illustrate the\r\npoint of view from whence we would consider the universe both in its\r\ncelestial and terrestrial sphere.  I am not insensible of the boldness of\r\nsuch an undertaking.  Among all the forms of exposition to which these pages\r\nare devoted, there is none more difficult than the general delineation of\r\nnature, which we purpose sketching, since we must not allow ourselves to be\r\noverpowered by a sense of the stupendous richness and variety of the forms\r\npresented to us, but must dwell only on the consideration of masses either\r\npossessing actual magnitude, or borrowing its semblance from the\r\nassociations awakened within the subjective sphere of ideas.  It is by a\r\nseparation and classification of phenomena by an intuitive insight into the\r\nplay of obscure forces, and by animated expressions, in which the\r\nperceptible spectacle is reflected with vivid truthfulness, that we may hope\r\nto comprehend and describe the 'universal all' [Greek words] in a manner\r\nworthy of the dignity of the word 'Cosmos' in its signification of\r\n'universe, order of the world', and 'adornment' of this universal order.\r\nMay the immeasurable diversity of phenomena which crowd into the picture of\r\nnature in no way detract from that harmonious impression of rest and unity\r\nwhich is the ultimate object of every literary or purely artistical\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the depths of space and the regions of remotest nebulae, we\r\nwill gradually descend through the starry zone to which our solar system\r\nbelongs, to our own terrestrial spheroid, circled by air and ocean, there to\r\ndirect our attention\r\np 80\r\nto its form, temperature, and magnetic tension, and to consider the fullness\r\nof organic life unfolding itself upon its surface beneath the vivifying\r\ninfluence of light.  In this manner a picture of the world may, with a few\r\nstrokes, be made to include the realms of infinity no less than the minute\r\nmicroscopic animal and vegetable organisms which exist in standing waters\r\nand on the weather-beaten surface of our rocks.  All that can be perceived\r\nby the senses, and all that has been accumulated up to the present day by an\r\nattentive and variously directed study of nature, constitute the materials\r\nfrom which this representation is to be drawn, whose character is an\r\nevidence of its fidelity and truth.  But the descriptive picture of nature\r\nwhich we purpose drawing must not enter too fully into detail, since a\r\nminute enumeration of all vital forms, natural objects, and processes is not\r\nrequisite to the completeness of the undertaking.  The delineator of nature\r\nmust resist the tendency toward endless division, in order to avoid the\r\ndangers presented by the very abundance of our empirical knowledge.  A\r\nconsiderable portion of the qualitative properties of matter -- or, to speak\r\nmore in accordance with the language of natural philosophy, of the\r\nqualitative expression of forces -- is doubtlessly still unknown to us, and\r\nthe attempt perfectly to represent unity in diversity must therefore\r\nnecessarily prove unsuccessful.  Thus, besides the pleasure derived and\r\ntinged with a shade of sadness, an unsatisfied longing for something beyond\r\nthe present -- a striving toward regions yet unknown and unopened.  Such a\r\nsense of longing binds still faster the links which, in accordance with the\r\nsupreme laws of our being, connect the material with the ideal world, and\r\nanimates the mysterious relation existing between that which the mind\r\nreceives from without, and that which it reflects from its own depths to the\r\nexternal world.  If, then, nature (understanding by the term all natural\r\nobjects and phenomena) be illimitable in extent and contents, it likewise\r\npresents itself to the human intellect as a problem which can not be\r\ngrasped, and whose solution is impossible, since it requires a knowledge of\r\nthe combined action of all natural forces.  Such an acknowledgement is due\r\nwhere the actual state and prospective development of phenomena constitute\r\nthe sole objects of direct investigation, which does not venture to depart\r\nfrom the strict rules of induction.  But, although the incessant effort to\r\nembrace nature in its universality may remain unsatisfied, the history of\r\nthe contemplation of the universe (which\r\np 81\r\nwill be considered in another part of this work) will teach us how, in the\r\ncourse of ages, mankind has gradually attained to a partial insight into the\r\nrelative dependence of phenomena.  My duty is to depict the results of our\r\nknowledge in all their bearings with reference to the present.  In all that\r\nis subject to motion and change in space, the ultimate aim, the very\r\nexpression of physical laws, depend upon 'mean numerical values', which show\r\nus the constant amid change, and the stable amid apparent fluctuations of\r\nphenomena.  Thus the progress of modern physical science is especially\r\ncharacterized by the attainment and the rectification of the mean values of\r\ncertain quantities by means of the processes of weighing and measuring; and\r\nit may be said, that the only remaining and widely-diffused hieroglyphic\r\ncharacters still in our writing -- 'numbers' -- appear to us again, as\r\npowers of the Cosmos, although in a wider sense than that applied to them by\r\nthe Italian School.\r\n\r\nThe earnest investigator delights in the simplicity of numerical relations,\r\nindicating the dimensions of the celestial regions, the magnitudes and\r\nperiodical disturbances of the heavenly bodies, the triple elements of\r\nterrestrial magnetism, the mean pressure of the atmosphere, and the quantity\r\nof heat which the sun imparts in each year, and in every season of the year,\r\nto all points of the solid and liquid surface of our planet.  These sources\r\nof enjoyment do not, however, satisfy the poet of Nature, or the mind of the\r\ninquiring many.  To both of these the present state of science appears as a\r\nblank, now that she answers doubtingly, or wholly rejects as unanswerable,\r\nquestions to which former ages deemed they could furnish satisfactory\r\nreplies.  In her severer aspect, and clothed with less luxuriance, she shows\r\nherself deprived of that seductive charm with which a dogmatizing and\r\nsymbolizing physical philosophy knew how to deceive the understanding and\r\ngive the rein to imagination.  Long before the discovery of the New World,\r\nit was believed that new lands in the Far West might be seen from the shores\r\nof the Canaries and the Azores.  These illusive images were owing, not to\r\nany extraordinary refraction of the rays of light, but produced by an eager\r\nlonging for the distant and the unattained.  The philosophy of the Greeks,\r\nthe physical views of the Middle Ages, and even those of a more recent\r\nperiod, have been eminently imbued with the charm springing from similar\r\nillusive phantoms of the imagination.  At the limits of circumscribed\r\nknowledge, as from some lofty island shore, the eye delights to penetrate\r\np 82\r\nto distant regions.  The belief in the uncommon and the wonderful lends a\r\ndefinite outline to every manifestation of ideal creation; and the realm of\r\nfancy -- a fairy-land of cosmological, geognostical, and magnetic visions --\r\nbecomes thus involuntarily blended with the domain of reality.\r\n\r\nNature, in the manifold signification of the word -- whether considered as\r\nthe universality of all that is and ever will be -- as the inner moving\r\nforce of all phenomena, or as their mysterious prototype -- reveals itself\r\nto the simple mind and feelings of man as something earthly, and closely\r\nallied to himself.  It is only within the animated circles of organic\r\nstructure that we feel ourselves peculiarly at home.  Thus, wherever the\r\nearth unfolds her fruits and flowers, and gives food to countless tribes of\r\nanimals, there the image of nature impresses itself most vividly upon our\r\nsenses.  The impression thus produced upon our minds limits itself almost\r\nexclusively to the reflection of the earthly.  The starry vault and the wide\r\nexpanse of the heavens belong to a picture of the universe, in which the\r\nmagnitude of masses, the number of congregated suns and faintly glimmering\r\nnebulae, although they excite our wonder and astonishment, manifest\r\nthemselves to us in apparent isolation, and as utterly devoid of all\r\nevidence of their being the scenes of organic life.  Thus, even in the\r\nearliest physical views of mankind, heaven and earth have been separated and\r\nopposed to one another as an upper and lower portion of space.  If, then, a\r\npicture of nature were to correspond to the requirements of contemplation by\r\nthe senses, it ought to begin with a delineation of our native earth.  It\r\nshould depict, first, the terrestrial planet as to its size and form; its\r\nincreasing density and heat at increasing depths in its superimposed solid\r\nand liquid strate; the separation of sea and land, and the vital forms\r\nanimating both, developed in the cellular tissues of plants and animals; the\r\natmospheric ocean, with its waves and currents, through which pierce the\r\nforest-crowned summits of our mountain chains.  After this delineation of\r\npurely telluric relations, the eye would rise to the celestial regions, and\r\nthe Earth would then, as the well-known seat of organic development, be\r\nconsidered as a planet, occupying a place in the series of those heavenly\r\nbodies which circle round one of the innumerable host of self-luminous\r\nstars.  This succession of ideas indicates the course pursued in the\r\nearliest stages of perceptive contemplation, and reminds us of the ancient\r\nconception of the \"sea-girt disk of earth,\" supporting the vault of heaven.\r\nIt begins to exercise in action\r\np 83\r\nat the spot where it originated, and passes from the consideration of the\r\nknown to the unknown, of the near to the distant.  It corresponds with the\r\nmethod pursued in our elementary works on astronomy (and which is so\r\nadmirable in a mathematical point of view), of proceeding from the apparent\r\nto the real movements of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nAnother course of ideas must, however, be pursued in a work which proposes\r\nmerely to give an exposition of what is known -- of what may in the present\r\nstate of our knowledge be regarded as certain, or as merely probable in a\r\ngreater or lesser degree -- and does not enter into a consideration of the\r\nproofs on which such results have been based.  Here, therefore, we do not\r\nproceed from the subjective point of view of human interests.  The\r\nterrestrial must be treated only as grand and free, uninfluenced by motives\r\nof proximity, social sympathy, or relative utility.  A physical cosmography\r\n-- a picture of the universe -- does not begin, therefore, with the picture\r\nof the universe -- does not begin, therefore, with the terrestrial, but with\r\nthat which fills the regions of space.  But as the sphere of contemplation\r\ncontracts in dimension our perception of the richness of individual parts,\r\nthe fullness of physical phenomena, and of the heterogeneous properties of\r\nmatter becomes enlarged.  From the regions in which we recognize ony the\r\ndominion of the laws of attraction, we descend to our own planet, and to the\r\nintricate play of terrestrial forces.  The method here described for the\r\ndelineation of nature is opposed to that which mst be pursued in\r\nestablishing conclusive results.  The one enumerates what the other\r\ndemonstrates.\r\n\r\nMan learns to know the external world through the organs of the senses.\r\nPhenomena of light proclaim the existence of matter in remotest space, and\r\nthe eye is thus made the medium through which we may contemplate the\r\nuniverse.  The discovery of telescopic vision more than two centuries ago,\r\nhas transmitted to latest generations a power whose limits are as yet\r\nunattained.\r\n\r\nThe first and most general consideration of the Cosmos is that of the\r\n'contents of space' -- the distribution of matter, or of creation, as we are\r\nwont to designate the assemblage of all that is and ever will be developed.\r\nWe see matter either agglomerated into rotating, revolving spheres of\r\ndifferent density and size, or scattered through space in the form of\r\nself-luminous vapor.  If we consider first the cosmical vapor dispersed in\r\ndefinite nebulous spots, its state of aggregation will\r\np 84\r\nappear constantly to vary, sometimes appearing separated into round or\r\nelliptical disks, single or in pairs, occasionally connected by a thread of\r\nlight; while, at another time, these nebulae occur in forms of larger\r\ndimensions, and are either elongated, or variously branched or fan-shaped or\r\nappear like well-defined rings, including a dark interior.  It is\r\nconjectured that these bodies are undergoing variously developed formative\r\nprocesses, as the cosmical vapor becomes condensed in conformity with the\r\nlaws of attraction, either round one or more of the nuclei.  Between two and\r\nthree thousand of such unresolvable nebulae, in which the most powerful\r\ntelescopes have hitherto been unable to distinguish the presence of stars,\r\nhave been counted, and their positions determined.\r\n\r\nThe genetic evolution -- that perpetual state of development which seems to\r\naffect this portion of the regions of space -- has led philosophical\r\nobservers to the discovery of the analogy existing among organic phenomena.\r\nAs in our forests we see the same kind of tree in all the various stages of\r\nits growth, and are thus enabled to form an idea of progressive, vital\r\ndevelopment, so do we also in the great garden of the universe, recognise\r\nthe most different phases of sidereal formation.  The process of\r\ncondensation, which formed a part of the doctrines of Anaximenes and of the\r\nIonian School, appears to be going on before our eyes.  This subject of\r\ninvestigation and conjecture is especially attractive to the imagination,\r\nfor in the study of the animated circles of nature, and of the action of all\r\nthe moving forces of the universe, the charm that exercises the most\r\npowerful influence on the mind is derived less from a knowledge of that\r\nwhich 'is' than from a perception of that which 'will be', even though the\r\nlatter be nothing more than a new condition of a known material existence;\r\nfor of actual creation, of origin, the beginning of existence from\r\nnon-existence, we have no experience, and can therefore form no conception.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the various causes influencing the development manifested by\r\nthe greater or less degree of condensation in the interior of nebulae, no\r\nless than a successive course of direct observations, have led to the belief\r\nthat changes of form have been recognized first in Andromeda, next in the\r\nconstallation Argo, and in the isolated filamentous portion of the nebula in\r\nOrion.  But want of uniformity in the power of the instruments employed,\r\ndifferent conditions of our atmosphere, and other optical relations, render\r\na part of the results invalid as historical evidence.\r\n\r\np 85\r\n'Nebulous stars' must not be confounded either with irregularly-shaped\r\nnebulous spots, properly so called, whose separate parts have an unequal\r\ndegree of brightness (and which may, perhaps, become concentrated into stars\r\nas their circumference contracts), nor with the so-called planetary nebulae,\r\nwhose circular or slightly oval disks manifest in all their parts a\r\nperfectly uniform degree of faint light.  'Nebulous stars' are not merely\r\naccidental bodies projected upon a nebulous ground, but are a part of the\r\nnebulous matter constituting one mass with the body which it surrounds.  The\r\nnot unfrequently considerable magnitude of their apparent diameter, and the\r\nremote distance from which they are revealed to us, show that both the\r\nplanetary nebulae and the nebulous stars must be of enormous dimensions.\r\nNew and ingenious considerations of the different influence exercised by\r\ndistance* on the intensity of light of a disk of appreciable diameter, and\r\nof a single self-luminous point, render it not improbable that the planetary\r\nnebulae are very remote nebulous stars, in which the difference between the\r\ncentral body and the surrounding nebulous covering can no longer be detected\r\nby our telescopic instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *  The optical considerations relative to the difference\r\npresented by a single luminous point, and by a disk subtending an\r\nappreciable angle, in which the intensity of light is constant at every\r\ndistance, are explained in Arago's 'Analyse des Travaux de Sir William\r\nHerschel' ('Annuaire du Bureau des Long.', 1842, p. 410-412, and 441).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnificent zones of the southern heavens, between 50 degrees and 80\r\ndegrees, are especially rich in nebulous stars, and in compressed\r\nunresolvable nebua e.  The larger of the two Magellanic clouds, which circle\r\nround the starless, desert pole of the south, appears, according to the most\r\nrecent researches,* as \"a collection of clusters of stars, composed of\r\nglobular clusters and nebulae of different magnitude, and of large nebulous\r\nspots\r\n\r\np 86\r\nnot resolvable, which, producing a general brightness in the field of view,\r\nform, as it were, the back-ground of the picture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The two Magellanic clouds, Nubecula major and Nubecula minor,\r\nare very remarkable objects.  The larger of the two is an accumulated mass\r\nof stars, and consists of clusters of stars of irregular form, either\r\nconical masses or nebulae of different magnitudes and degrees of\r\ncondensation.  This is interspersed with nebulous spots, not resolvable into\r\nstars, but which are probably 'star dust', appearing only as a general\r\nradiance upon the telescopic field of a twenty-feet reflector, and forming a\r\nluminous ground on which other objects of striking and indescribable form\r\nare scattered.  In no other portion of the heavens are so many nebulous and\r\nstellar masses thronged together in an equally small space.  Nubecula minor\r\nis much less beautiful, has more unresolvable nebulous light, while the\r\nstellar masses are fewer and fainter in intensity. -- (From a letter of Sir\r\nJohn Herschel, Feldhuysen, Cape of Good Hope, 13th June, 1836.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of these clouds, of the brightly-beaming constellation Argo,\r\nof the Milky Way between Scorpio, the Centaur, and the Southern Cross, the\r\npicturesque beauty, if one may so speak, of the whole expanse of the\r\nsouthern celestial hemisphere, has left upon my mind an ineffaceable\r\nimpression.  The zodiacal light, which rises in a pyramidal form, and\r\nconstantly contributes, by its mild radiance, to the external beauty of the\r\ntropical nights, is either a vast nebulous ring, rotating between the Earth\r\nand Mars, or, less probably, the exterior stratum of the solar atmosphere.\r\nBesides these luminous clouds and nebulae of definite form, exact and\r\ncorresponding observations indicate the existence and the general\r\ndistribution of an apparently non-luminous, infinitely-divided matter, which\r\nposssesses a force of resistance and manifests its presence in Encke's, and\r\nperhaps also in Biela's comet, by diminishing their eccentricity and\r\nshortening their period of revolution.  Of this impending, ethereal, and\r\ncosmical matter, it may be supposed that it is in motion; that it\r\ngravitates, notwithstanding its original tenuity; that it is condensed in\r\nthe vicinity of the great mass of the Sun; and, finally, that it may, for\r\nmyriads of ages, have been augmented by the vapor emanating from the tails\r\nof comets.\r\n\r\nIf we now pass from the consideration of the vaporous matter of the\r\nimmeasurable regions of space [(Greek)*] -- whether scattered without\r\ndefinite form and limits, it exists as a cosmical other, or is condensed\r\ninto nebulous spots, and becomes comprised among the solid agglomerated\r\nbodies of the universe -- we approach a class of phenomena exclusively\r\ndesignated by the form of stars, or as the sidereal world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *I should have made use, in the place of garden of the universe,\r\nof the beautiful expression [Greek], borrowed by Hesychius from an unknown\r\npoet, if [Greek] had not rather signified in general an inclosed space.  The\r\nconnection with the German 'garten' and the English 'garden', 'gards' in\r\nGothic (derived according to Jacob Grimm, from 'gairdan', 'to gird'), is,\r\nhowever, evident, as is likewise the affinity with the Slavonic 'grad',\r\n'gorod', and as Pott remarks, in his 'Etymol. Forschungen', th. i., s. 144\r\n(Etymol. Researches), with the Latin 'chors', whence we have the Spanish\r\n'corte', the French 'cour', and the English word 'court', together with the\r\nOssetic 'khart'.  To these may be further added the Scandinavian 'gard',**\r\n'gard', a place inclosed, as a court, or a country seat, and the Persian\r\n'gerd', 'gird', a district, a circle, a princely country seat, a castle or\r\ncity, as we find the term applied to the names of places in Firdusi's\r\nSchahnameh, as 'Siyawakschgird', 'Darabgird', etc.\r\n\r\n** (This word is written 'gaard' in the Danish) -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\np 87\r\nHere, too, we find differences existing in the solidity or density of the\r\nspheroidally agglomerated matter.  Our own solar system presents all stages\r\nof 'mean' density (or of the relation of 'volume' to 'mass'.)  On comparing\r\nthe planets from Mercury to Mars with the Sun and with Jupiter, and these\r\ntwo last named with the yet inferior density of Saturn, we arrive, by a\r\ndescending scale -- to draw our illustration from the terrestrial substances\r\n-- at the respective densities of antimony, honey, water, and pine wood.  In\r\ncomets, which actually constitute the most considerable portion of our solar\r\nsystem with respect to the number of individual forms, the concentrated\r\npart, usually termed the 'head', or 'nucleus', transmits sidereal light\r\nunimpaired.  The mass of a comet probably in no case equals the five\r\nthousandth part of that of the earth, so dissimilar are the formative\r\nprocesses manifested in the original and perhaps still progressive\r\nagglomerations of matter.  In proceeding from general to special\r\nconsiderations, it was particularly desirable to draw attention to this\r\ndiversity, not merely as a possible, but as an actually proved fact.\r\n\r\nThe purely speculative conclusions arrived at by Wright, Kant, and Lambert,\r\nconcerning the general structural arrangement of the universe, and of the\r\ndistribution of matter in space, have been confirmed by Sir William\r\nHerschel, on the more certain path of observation and measurement.  That\r\ngreat and enthusiastic, although cautious observer, was the first to sound\r\nthe depths of heaven in order to determine the limits and form of the starry\r\nstratum which we inhabit, and he, too, was the first who ventured to throw\r\nthe light of investigation upon the relations existing between the position\r\nand distance of remote nebulae and our own portion of the sidereal universe.\r\n William Herschel, as is well expressed in the elegant inscription on his\r\nmonument at Upton, broke through the inclosures of heaven ('caelorum\r\nperrupit claustra'), and, like another Columbus, penetrated into an unknown\r\nocean, from which he beheld coasts and groups of islands, whose true\r\nposition it remains for future ages to determine.\r\n\r\nConsiderations regarding the different intensity of light in stars, and\r\ntheir relative number, that is to say, their numerical frequency on\r\ntelescopic fields of equal magnitude, have led to the assumption of unequal\r\ndistances and distribution in space in the strata which they compose.  Such\r\nassumptions, in as far as they may lead us to draw the limits of the\r\nindividual portions of the universe, can not offer the same degree of\r\nmathematical certainty as that which may be attained in all that\r\np 88\r\nrelates to our solar system, whether we consider the rotation of double\r\nstars with unequal velocity round one common center of gravity, or the\r\napparent or true movements of all the heavenly bodies.  If we take up the\r\nphysical description of the universe from the remotest nebulae, we may be\r\ninclined to compare it with the mythical portions of history.  The one\r\nbegins in the obscurity of antiquity, the other in that of inaccessible\r\nspace; and at the point where reality seems to flee before us, imagination\r\nbecomes doubly incited to draw from its own fullness, and give definite\r\noutline and permanence to the changing forms of objects.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the regions of the universe with one of the island-studded\r\nseas of our own planet, we may imagine matter to be distributed in groups,\r\neither as unresolvable nebulae of different ages, condensed around one or\r\nmore nuclei, or as already agglomerated into clusters of stars, or isolated\r\nspheroidal bodies.  The cluster of stars, to which our cosmical island\r\nbelongs, forms a lens-shaped, flattened stratum, detached on every side,\r\nwhose major axis is estimated at seven or eight hundred, and its minor one\r\nat a hundred and fifty times the distance of Sirius.  It would appear, on\r\nthe supposition that the parallax of Sirius is not greater than that\r\naccurately determined for the brightest star in the Centaur (0\".9128), that\r\nlight traverses one distance of Sirius in three years, while it also\r\nfollows, from Bessel's earlier excellent Memoir* on the parallax of the\r\nremarkable star 61 Cygni (0\".3483), (whose considerable motion might lead to\r\nthe inference of great proximity), that a period of nine years and a quarter\r\nis required for the transmission of light from this star to our planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Maclear's \"Results from 1839 to 1840,\" in the 'Trans. of\r\nthe Astronomical Soc.', vol. xii., p. 370, on 'a' Centauri, the probable\r\nmean error being 0\".0649.  For 61 Cygni, see Bessel, in Schumacher's\r\n'Jahrbuch', 1839, s. 47, and Schumacher's 'Astron. Nachr.', bd. xviii., s.\r\n401, 402, probable mean error, 0\".0141.  With reference to the relative\r\ndistances of stars of different magnitudes, how those of the third magnitude\r\nmay probably be three times more remote, and the manner in which we\r\nrepresent to ourselves the material arrangement of the starry strata, I have\r\nfound the following remarkable passage in Kepler's 'Epitome Astronomiae\r\nCopernicanae', 1618, t. i., lib. 1, p. 34-39:  \"Sol hic noster nil aliud est\r\nquam una ex fixis, nobis major et clarior visa, quia propior quam fixa.\r\nPone terram stare ad latus, una semi-diametro via e lactea e, tunc ha ec via\r\nlactea apparebit circulus parvus, vel ellipsis parva, tota declinans ad\r\nlatus alterum; eritque simul uno intuitu conspicua, quae nunc no potest nisi\r\ndimidia conspici quovis momento.  Itaque fix arum spha era non tantum orbe\r\nstellarum, sed etiam circulo lactis versus not deorsum est terminata.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOur starry stratum is a disk of inconsiderable thickness, divided a\r\np 89\r\nthird of its length into two branches; it is supposed that we are near this\r\ndivision, and nearer to the region of Sirius than to the constellation\r\nAquila, almost in the middle of the stratum in the line of its thickness or\r\nminor axis.\r\n\r\nThis position of our solar system, and the form of the whole discoidal\r\nstratum, have been inferred from sidereal scales, that is to say, from that\r\nmethod of counting the stars to which I have already alluded, and which is\r\nbased upon the equidistant subdivision of the telescopic field of view.  The\r\nrelative depth of the stratum in all directions is measured by the greater\r\nor smaller number of stars appearing in each division.  These divisions give\r\nthe length of the ray of vision in the same manner as we measure the depth\r\nto which the plummet has been thrown, before it reaches the bottom, although\r\nin the case of a starry stratum there can not, correctly speaking, be any\r\nidea of depth, but merely of outer limits.  In the direction of the longer\r\naxis, where the stars lie behind one another, the more remote ones appear\r\nclosely crowded together, united, as it were, by a milky-white radiance or\r\nluminous vapor, and are perspectively grouped, encircling as in a zone, the\r\nvisible vault of heaven.  This narrow and branched girdle, studded with a\r\nradiant light, and here and there interrupted by dark spots, deviates only\r\nby a few degrees from forming a perfect large circle round the concave\r\nsphere of heaven, owing to our being near the center of the large starry\r\ncluster, and almost on the plane of the Milky Way.  If our planetary system\r\nwere far 'outside' this cluster, the Milky Way would appear to telescopic\r\nvision as a ring, and at a still greater distance as a resolvable discoidal\r\nnebula.\r\n\r\nAmong the many self-luminous moving suns, erroneously called 'fixed stars',\r\nwhich constitute our cosmical island, our own sun is the only one known by\r\ndirect observation to be a 'central body' in its relations to spherical\r\nagglomerations of matter directly depending upon and revolving round it,\r\neither in the form of planets, comets, or aerolite asteroids.  As far as we\r\nhave hitherto been able to investigate 'multiple' stars (double stars or\r\nsuns), these bodies are not subject, with respect to relative motion and\r\nillumination, to the same planetary dependence that characterizes our own\r\nsolar system.  Two or more self-luminous bodies, whose planets and moon, if\r\nsuch exist, have hitherto escaped our telescopic powers of vision, certainly\r\nrevolve around one common center of gravity; but this is in a portion of\r\nspace which is probably occupied merely by unagglomerated matter or cosmical\r\nvapor, while in our system\r\np 90\r\nthe center of gravity is often comprised within the innermost limits of a\r\n'visible' central body.  If, therefore, we regard the Sun and the Earth, or\r\nthe Earth and the Moon, as double-stars, and the whole of our planetary\r\nsolar system as a multiple cluster of stars, the analogy thus suggested must\r\nbe limited to the universality of the laws of attraction in different\r\nsystems, being alike applicable to the independent processes of light and to\r\nthe method of illumination.\r\n\r\nFor the generalization of cosmical views, corresponding with the plan we\r\nhave proposed to follow in giving a delineation of nature or of the\r\nuniverse, the solar system to which the Earth belongs may be considered in a\r\ntwo-fold relation:  first, with respect to the different classes of\r\nindividually agglomerated matter, and the relative size, conformation,\r\ndensity, and distance of the heavenly bodies of this system; and secondly,\r\nwith reference to other portions of our starry cluster, and of the changes\r\nof position of its central body, the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe solar system, that is to say, the variously-formed matter circling round\r\nthe Sun, consists, according to the present state of our knowledge of\r\n'eleven primary planets',* eighteen satellites\r\np 91\r\nor secondary planets, and myriads of comets, three of which, known as the\r\n\"planetary comets,\" do not pass beyond the narrow limits of the orbits\r\ndescribed by the principal planets.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * (Since the publication of Baron Humboldt's work in 1845,\r\nseveral other planets have been discovered, making the number of those\r\nbelonging to our planetary system 'sixteen' instead of 'eleven'.  Of these,\r\nAstrea, Hebe, Flora, and Iris are members of the remarkable group of\r\nasteroids between Mars and Jupiter.  Astrea and Hebe were discovered by\r\nHencke at Driesen, the one in 1846 and the other in 1847; Flora and Iris\r\nwere both discovered in 1847 by Mr. Hind, at the South Villa Observatory,\r\nRegent's Park.  It would appear from the latest determinations of their\r\nelements, that the small planets have the following order with respect to\r\nmean distance from the Sun:  Flora, Iris, Vesta, Hebe, Astrea, Juno, Ceres,\r\nPallas.  Of these, Flora has the shortest period (about 3 1/4 years).  The\r\nplanet Neptune, which, after having been predicted by several astronomers,\r\nwas actually observed on the 25th of September, 1846, is situated on the\r\nconfines of our planetary system beyond Uranus.  The discovery of this\r\nplanet is not only highly interesting from the importance attached to it as\r\na question of science, but also from the evidence it affords of the care and\r\nunremitting labor evinced by modern astronomers in the investigation and\r\ncomparison of the older calculations, and the ingenious application of the\r\nresults thus obtained to the observation of new facts.  The merit of having\r\npaved the way for the discovery of the planet Neptune is due to M. Bouvard,\r\nwho, in his persevering and assiduous efforts to deduce the entire orbit of\r\nUranus from observations made during the forty years that succeeded the\r\ndiscovery of that planet in 1781, found the results yielded by theory to be\r\nat variance with fact, in a degree that had no parallel in the history of\r\nastronomy.  This startling discrepancy, which seemed only to gain additional\r\nweight from every attempt made by M. Bouvard to correct his calculations,\r\nled Leverrier, after a careful modification of the tables of Bouvard, to\r\nestablish the proposition that there was \"a formal incompatibility between\r\nthe observed motions of Uranus and the hypothesis that he was acted on\r\n'only' by the Sun and known planets, according to the law of universal\r\ngravitation.\"  Pursuing this idea, Leverrier arrived at the conclusion that\r\nthe disturbing cause must be a 'planet', and finally, after an amount of\r\nlabor that seems perfectly overwhelming, he, on the 31st of August, 1846,\r\nlaid before the French Institute a paper, in which he indicated the exact\r\nspot in the heavens where this new planetary body would be found, giving the\r\nfollowing data for its various elements:  mean distance from the Sun, 36.154\r\ntimes that of the Earth; period of revolution, 217.387 years; mean long.,\r\nJan. 1st, 1847, 318 degrees 47'; mass, 1/9300th; heliocentric long., Jan\r\n1st1847, 326 degrees 32'.  Essential difficulties still intervened, however,\r\nand as the remoteness of the planet rendered it improbable that its disk\r\nwould be discernible by any telescopic instrument, no other means remained\r\nfor detecting the suspected body but its planetary motion, which could only\r\nbe ascertained by mapping, after every observation, the quarter of the\r\nheavens scanned, and by a comparison of the various maps.  Fortunately for\r\nthe verification of Leverrier's predictions, Dr. Bremiker had just completed\r\na map of the precise region in which it was expected the new planet would\r\napper, this being one of a series of maps made for the Academy of Berlin, of\r\nthe small stars along the entire zodiac.  By means of this valuable\r\nassistance, Dr. Galle, of the Berlin Observatory, was led, on the 25th of\r\nSeptember, 1846, by the discovery of a star of the eighth magnitude, not\r\nrecorded in Dr. Bremiker's map, to make the first observation of the planet\r\npredicted by Leverrier.  By a singular coincidence, Mr. Adams, of Cambridge,\r\nhad predicted the appearance of the planet simultaneously with M. Leverrier;\r\nbut by the concurrence of several circumstances much to be regretted, the\r\nworld at large were not made acquainted with Mr. Adams's valuable discovery\r\nuntil subsequently to the period at which Leverrier published his\r\nobservations.  As the data of Leverrier and Adams stand at present, there is\r\na discrepancy between the predicted and the true distance, and in some other\r\nelements of the planet; it remains therefore, for these or future\r\nastronomers to reconcile theory with fact, or perhaps, as in the case of\r\nUranus, to make the new planet the means of leading to yet greater\r\ndiscoveries.  It would appear from the most recent observations, that the\r\nmass of Neptune, instead of being, as at first stated, 1/9300th, is only\r\nabout 1/23000th that of the Sun, while its periodic time is now given with a\r\ngreater probability at 166 years, and its mean distance from the Sun nearly\r\n30.  The planet appears to have a ring, but as yet no accurate observations\r\nhave been made regarding its system of satellites.  See 'Trans. Astron.\r\nSoc.', and 'The Planet Neptune', 1848, by J. P. Nicholl.) -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may, with no incondsiderable degree of probability, include within the\r\ndomain of our Sun, in the immediate sphere of its central force, a rotating\r\nring of vaporous matter, lying probably between the orbits of Venus and\r\nMars, but certainly beyond that of the Earth,* which appears to us in\r\np 92\r\na pyramidal form, and is known as the 'Zodiacal Light'; and a host of very\r\nsmall asteroids, whose orbits either intersect, or very nearly approach,\r\nthat of our earth, and which present us with the phenomena of aerolites and\r\nfalling or shooting stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * \"If there should be molecules in the zones diffused by the\r\natmosphere of the Sun of too volatile a nature either to combine with one\r\nanother or with the planets, we must suppose that they would, in circling\r\nround that luminary, present all the appearances of zodiacal light, without\r\nopposing any appreciable resistance to the different bodies composing the\r\nplanetary system, either owing to their extreme rarity, or to the similarity\r\nexisting between their motion and that of the planets with which they come\r\nin contact.\" -- Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde' (ed. 5), p. 415.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the complication of variously-formed bodies which revolve\r\nround the Sun in orbits of such dissimilar eccentricity--although we may not\r\nbe disposed, with the immortal author of the 'Mecanique Celeste', to regard\r\nthe largr number of comets as nebulous stars, passing from one central\r\nsystem to another,* we yet can not fail to acknowledge that the planetary\r\nsystem, especially so called (that is, the group of heavenly bodies which,\r\ntogether with their satellites, revolve with but slightly eccentric orbits\r\nround the Sun), constitutes but a small portion of the whole system with\r\nrespect to individual numbers, if not to mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Exp. du Syst. du Monde', p. 396, 414.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to consider the telescopic planets, Vesta, Juno, Ceres,\r\nand Pallas, with their more closely intersecting, inclined, and eccentric\r\norbits, as a zone of separation, or as a middle group in space; and if this\r\nview be adopted, we shall discover that the interior planetary group\r\n(consisting of Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars) presents several very\r\nstriking contrasts* when compared with the exterior group, comprising\r\nJupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *Littrow, 'Astronomie', 1825, bd.xi., 107.  Mädler, 'Astron.',\r\n1841, § 212.  Laplace, 'Exp. du Syst. du Monde', p. 210.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planets nearest the Sun, and consequently included in the inner group,\r\nare of more moderate size, denser, rotate more slowly and with nearly equal\r\nvelocity (their periods of revolution being almost all about 24 hours), are\r\nless compressed at the poles, and with the exception of one, are without\r\nsatellites.  The exterior planets, which are further removed from the Sun,\r\nare very considerably larger, have a density five times less, more than\r\ntwice as great a velocity in the period of their rotation round their axes,\r\nare more compressed at the poles, and if six satellites may be ascribed to\r\nUranus, have a quantitative preponderance in the number of their attendant\r\nmoons, which is as seventeen to one.\r\n\r\np 93\r\nSuch general considerations regarding certain characteristic properties\r\nappertaining to whole groups, can not, however, be applied with equal\r\njustice to the individual planets of every group, nor to the relations\r\nbetween the distances of the revolving planets from the central body, and\r\ntheir absolute size, density, period or rotation, eccentricity, and the\r\ninclination of their orbits and the axes.  We know as yet of no inherent\r\nnecessity,  no mechanical natural law, similar to the one which teaches us\r\nthat the squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the\r\nmajor axes, by which the above-named six elements of the planetary bodies\r\nand the form of their orbit are made dependent either on one another, or on\r\ntheir mean distance from the Sun.  Mars is smaller than the Earth and Venus,\r\nalthough further removed from the Sun than these last-named planets,\r\napproaching most nearly in size to Mercury, the nearest planet to the Sun.\r\nSaturn is smaller than Jupiter, and yet much larger than Uranus.  The zone\r\nof the telescopic planets, which have so inconsiderable a volume,\r\nimmediately procede Jupiter (the greatest in size of any of the planetary\r\nbodies), if we consider them with regard to distance from the Sun; and yet\r\nthe disks of these small asteroids, which scarcely admit of measurement,\r\nhave an areal surface not much more than half that of France, Madagascar, or\r\nBorneo.  However striking may be the extremely small density of all the\r\ncolossal planets, which are furthest removed from the Sun, we are yet unable\r\nin this respect to recognize any regular succession.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *See Kepler, on the increasing density and volume of the planets\r\nin proportion with their increase of distance from the Sun, which is\r\ndescribed as the densest of all the heavenly bodies; in the 'Epitome Astran.\r\nCopern. in' vii. 'libros digesta', 1618-1622, p. 420.  Leibnitz also\r\ninclined to the opinions of Kepler and Otto von Guericke, that the planets\r\nincrease in volume in proportion to their increase of distance from the Sun.\r\n See his letter to the Magdeburg Burgomaster (Mayence, 1671), in Leibnitz,\r\n'Deutschen Schriften, herausg. von Guhrauer', th. i., 264.\r\n\r\n\r\nUranus appears to be denser than Saturn, even if we adopt the smaller mass,\r\n1/24605, assumed by Lamont; and, notwithstanding the inconsiderable\r\ndifference of density observed in the innermost planetary group,* we find\r\nboth Venus and Mars less dense than the Earth, which lies between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *On the arrangement of masses, see Encke, in Schum., 'Astr.\r\nNachr', 1843 Nr. 488, 114.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time of rotation certainly diminishes with increasing solar distance,\r\nbut yet it is greater in Mars than in the Earth, and in Saturn than in\r\nJupiter.  The elliptic\r\np 94\r\norbits of Juno, Pallas, and Mercury have the greatest degree of\r\neccentricity, and Mars and Venus, which immediately follow each other, have\r\nthe least.  Mercury and Venus exhibit the same contrasts that may be\r\nobserved in the four smaller planets, or asteroids, whose paths are so\r\nclosely interwoven.\r\n\r\nThe eccentriciities of Juno and Pallas are very nearly identical, and reach\r\nthree times as great as those of Ceres and Vesta.  The same may be said of\r\nthe inclination of the orbits of the planets toward the plane of projection\r\nof the ecliptic, or in the position of their axes of rotation with relation\r\nto their orbits, a position on which the relations of climate, seasons of\r\nthe year, and length of the days depend more than on eccentricity.  Those\r\nplanets that have the most elongated elliptic orbits, as Juno, Pallas, and\r\nMercury, have also, although not to the same degree their orbits most\r\nstrongly inclined toward the ecliptic.  Pallas has a comet-like inclination\r\nnearly twenty-six times greater than that of Jupiter, while in the little\r\nplanet Vesta, which is so near Pallas, the angle of inclination scarcely by\r\nsix times exceeds that of Jupiter.  An equally irregular succession is\r\nobserved in the position of the axes of the few planets (four or five) whose\r\nplanes of rotation we know with any degree of certainty.  It would appear\r\nfrom the position of the satellites of Uranus, two of which, the second and\r\nfourth, have been recently observed with certainty, that the axis of this,\r\nthe outermost of all the planets is scarcely inclined as much as 11 degrees\r\ntoward the plane of its orbit, while Saturn is placed between this planet,\r\nwhose axis almost coincides with the plane of its orbit, and Jupiter, whose\r\naxis of rotation is nearly perpendicular to it.\r\n\r\nIn this enumeration of the forms which compose the world in space, we have\r\ndelineated them as possessing an actual existence, and not as objects of\r\nintellectual contemplation, or as mere links of a mental and causal chain of\r\nconnection.  The planetary system, in its relations of absolute size and\r\nrelative position of the axes, density, time of rotation, and different\r\ndegrees of eccentricity of the orbits, does not appear to offer to our\r\napprehension any stronger evidence of a natural necessity than the\r\nproportion observed in the distribution of land and water on the Earth, the\r\nconfiguration of continents, or the height of mountain chains.  In these\r\nrespects we can discover no common law in the regions of space or in the\r\ninequalities of the earth's crust.  They are 'facts' in nature that have\r\narisen from the conflict of manifold forces acting under unknown\r\np 95\r\nconditions, although man considers as 'accidental' whatever he is unable to\r\nexplain in the planetary formation on purely genetic principles.  If the\r\nplanets have been formed out of separate rings of vaporous matter revolving\r\nround the Sun, we may conjecture that the different thickness, unequal\r\ndensity, temperature, and electro-magnetic tension of these rings may have\r\ngiven occasion to the most various agglomerations of matter, in the same\r\nmanner as the amount of tangential velocity and small variations in its\r\ndirection have produced so great a differencein the forms and inclinations\r\nof the elliptic orbits.  Attractions of mass and laws of gravitation have no\r\ndoubt exercised an influence here, no less than in the geognostic relations\r\nof the elevations of continents; but we are unable from the present forms to\r\ndraw any conclusions regarding the series of conditions through which they\r\nhave passed.  Even the so-called law of the distances of the planets from\r\nthe Sun, the law of progression (which led Kepler to conjecture the\r\nexistence of a planet supplying the link that was wanting in the chain of\r\nconnection between Mars and Jupiter), has been found numerically inexact for\r\nthe distances between Mercury, Venus, and the Earth, and a variance with the\r\nconception of a series, owing to the necessity for a supposition in the case\r\nof the first member.\r\n\r\nThe hitherto disscovered principal planets that revolve round our Sun are\r\nattended certainly by fourteen, and probably by eighteen secondary planets\r\n(moons or satellites).  The principal planets are, therefore, themselves the\r\ncentral bodies of subordinate systems.  We seem to recognize in the fabric\r\nof the universe the same process of arrangement so frequently exhibited in\r\nthe development of organic life, where we find in the manifold combinations\r\nof groups of plants or animals the same typical form repeated in the\r\n'subordinate classes'.  The secondary planets or satellites are more\r\nfrequent in the external region of the planetary system, lying beyond the\r\nintersecting orbits of the smaller planets or asteroids; in the inner region\r\nnone of the planets are attended by satellites, with the exception of the\r\nEarth, whose moon is relatively of great magnitude, since its diameter is\r\nequal to a fourth of that of the Earth, while the diameter of the largest of\r\nall known secondary planets -- the sixth satellite of Saturn -- is probably\r\nabout one seventeenth, and the largest of Jupiter's moons, the third, only\r\nabout one twenty-sixth part that of the primary planet or central body.  The\r\nplanets which are attended by the largest number of satellites are most\r\nremote from the Sun,\r\np 96\r\nand are at the same time the largest, most compressed at the poles, and the\r\nleast dense.  According to the most recent measurements of Mädler, Uranus\r\nhas a greater planetary compression than any other of the planets, viz.,\r\n1/9.92d.  In our Earth and her moon, whose mean distance from one another\r\namounts to 207,200 miles, we find that the differences of mass* and diameter\r\nbetween the two are much less considerable than are usually observed to\r\nexist between the principal planets and their attendant satellites, or\r\nbetween bodies of different orders in the solar system.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *If, according to Burckhardt's determination, the Moon's radius\r\nbe 0.2725 and its volume 1/49.00th, its density will be 0.5596, or nearly\r\nfive ninths.  Compare, also, Wilh. Beer and H. Madler, 'der Mond', 2, 10,\r\nand Madler, 'Ast.',  157.  The material contents of the Moon are, according\r\nto Hansen, nearly 1/34th (and ädler 1/40.6th) that of the Earth, and its\r\nmass equal to 1/87.73d that of the Earth.  In the largest of Jupiter's\r\nmoons, the third, the relations of volume to the central body are 1/15370th,\r\nand of mass 1/11300th.  On the polar flattening of Uranus, see Schum,\r\n'Astron. Nachr.', 1844, No. 493.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the density of the Moon is five ninths less than that of the Earth, it\r\nwould appear, if we may sufficiently depend upon the determinations of their\r\nmagnitudes and masses, that the second of Jupiter's moons is actually denser\r\nthan that great planet itself.  Among the fourteen satellites that have been\r\ninvestigated with any degree of certainty, the system of the seven\r\nsatellites of Saturn presents an instance of the greatest possible contrast,\r\nboth in absolute magnitude and in distance from the central body.  The sixth\r\nof these satellites is probably not much smaller than Mars, while our moon\r\nhas a diameter which does not amount to more than half that of the latter\r\nplanet.  With respect to volume, the two outer, the sixth and seventh of\r\nSaturn's satellites, approach the nearest to the third and brightest of\r\nJupiter's moons.  The two innermost of these satellites belong perhaps,\r\ntogether with the remote moons of Uranus to the smallest cosmical bodies of\r\nour solar system, being only made visible under favorable circumstances by\r\nthe most powerful instruments.  They were first discovered by the forty-foot\r\ntelescope of William Herschel in 1789, and were seen again by John Herschel\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope, by Vico at Rome, and by Lamont at Munich.\r\nDeterminations of the 'true' diameter of satellites, made by the measurement\r\nof the apparent size of their small disks, are subjected to many optical\r\ndifficulties; but numerical astronomy, whose task it is to predetermine by\r\ncalculation the motions of the heavenly bodies as they will appear when\r\nviewed from the Earth, is directed almost\r\np 97\r\nexclusively to motion and mass, and but little to volume.  The absolute\r\ndistance of a satellite from its central body is greatest in the case of the\r\noutermost or seventh satellite of Saturn, its distance from the body round\r\nwhich it revolves amounting to more than two millions of miles, or ten times\r\nas great a distance as that of our moon from the Earth.  In the case of\r\nJupiter we find that the outermost or fourth attendant moon is only\r\n1,040,000 miles from that planet, while the distance between Uranus and its\r\nsixth satellite (if the latter really exist) amounts to as much as 1,360,000\r\nmiles.  If we compare, in each of these subordinate systems, the volume of\r\nthe satellite, we discover the existence of entirely new numerical\r\nrelations.  The distances of the outermost satellites of Uranus, Saturn, and\r\nJupiter are when expressed in semi-diameters of the main planets, as 91, 64,\r\nand 27.  The outermost satellite of Saturn appears, therefore, to be removed\r\nonly about one fifteenth further from the center of that planet than our\r\nmoon is from the Earth.  The first or innermost of Saturn's satellites is\r\nnearer to its central body than any other of the secondary planets, and\r\npresents, moreover, the only instance of a period of revolution of less than\r\ntwenty-four hours.  Its distance from the center of Saturn may, according to\r\nMädler and Wilhelm Beer, be expressed as 2.47 semi-diameters of that\r\nplanet, or as 80,088 miles.  Its distance from the surface of the main\r\nplanet is therefore 47,480 miles, and from the outer-most edge of the ring\r\nonly 4916 miles.  The traveler may form to himself an estimate of the\r\nsmallness of this amount by remembering the statement of an enterprising\r\nnavigator, Captain Beechey, that he had in three years passed over 72,800\r\nmiles.  If, instead of absolute distances, we take the semi-diameters of the\r\nprincipal planets, we shall find that even the first or nearest of the moons\r\nof Jupiter (which is 26,000 miles further removed from the center of that\r\nplanet than our moon is from that of the Earth) is only six semi-diameters\r\nof Jupiter from its center, while our moon is removed from us fully 60 1/3d\r\nsemi-diameters of the Earth.\r\n\r\nIn the subordinate systems of satellites, we find that the same laws of\r\ngravitation which regulate the revolutions of the principal planets round\r\nthe Sun likewise govern the mutual relations existing between these planets\r\namong one another and with reference to their attendant satellites.  The\r\ntwelve moons of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Earth all most like the primary\r\nplanets from west to east, and in elliptic orbits, deviating\r\np 98\r\nbut little from circles.  It is only in the case of one moon, and perhaps in\r\nthat of the first and innermost of the satellites of Saturn (0.068), that we\r\ndiscover an eccentricity greater than that of Jupiter; according to the very\r\nexact observations of Bessel, the eccentricity of the sixth of Saturn's\r\nsatellites (0.029) exceeds that of the Earth.  On the extremest limits of\r\nthe planetary system, where, at a distance nineteen times greater than that\r\nof our Earth, the centripetal force of the Sun is greatly diminished, the\r\nsatellites of Uranus (which most striking contrasts from the facts observed\r\nwith regard to other secondary planets.  Instead, as in all other\r\nsatellites, of having their orbits but slightly inclined toward the ecliptic\r\nand (not excepting even Saturn's ring, which may be regarded as a fusion of\r\nagglomerated satellites) moving from west to east, the satellites of Uranus\r\nare almost perpendicular to the ecliptic, and move retrogressively from east\r\nto west, as Sir John Herschel has proved by observations continued during\r\nmany years.  If the primary and secondary planets have been formed by the\r\ncondensation of rotating rings of solar and planetary atmospheric vapor,\r\nthere must have existed singular causes of retardation or impediment in the\r\nvaporous rings revolving round Uranus, by which, under the relations with\r\nwhich we are unacquainted, the revolution of the second and fourth of its\r\nsatellites was made to assume a direction opposite to that of the rotation\r\nof the central planet.\r\n\r\nIt seems highly probable that the period of rotation of 'all' secondary\r\nplanets is equal to that of their revolution round the main planet, and\r\ntherefore that they always present to the latter the same side.\r\nInequalities, occasioned by sight variations in the revolution, give rise to\r\nfluctuations of from 6 degrees to 8 degrees, or to an apparent libration in\r\nlongitude as well as in latitude.  Thus, in the case of our moon, we\r\nsometimes observe more than the half of its surface, the eastern and\r\nnorthern edges being more visible at one time, and the western or southern\r\nat another.  By means of this libration* we are enabled to see the annular\r\nmountain Malapert (which occasionally conceals the Moon's south pole), the\r\narctic landscape round the crater of Gioja, and the large gray plane near\r\nEndymion which exceeds in superficial extent the 'Mare Vaporum'.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *Beer and Madler, op. cit., 185, s.208, and § 347, s. 332; and\r\nix their 'Phys. Kenntniss der himml. Korper', s. 4 und 69, Tab. 1 (Physical\r\nHistory of the Heavenly Bodies).\r\n\r\n\r\nThree sevenths of the Moon's surface are entirely\r\np 99\r\nconcealed from our observation, and must always remain so, unless new and\r\nunexpected disturbing causes come into play.  These cosmical relations\r\ninvoluntarily remind us of nearly similar conditions in the intellectual\r\nworld, where, in the domain of deep research into the mysteries and the\r\nprimeval creative forces of nature, there are regions similarly turned away\r\nfrom us, and apparently unattainable, of which only a narrow margin has\r\nrevealed itself, for thousands of years, to the human mind, appearing, from\r\ntime to time, either glimmering in true or delusive light.  We have hitherto\r\nconsidered the primary planets, their satellites, and the concentric rings\r\nwhich belong to one, at least, of the outermost planets, as products of\r\ntangential force, and as closely connected together by mutual attraction; it\r\ntherefore now only remains for us to speak of the unnumbered host of\r\n'comets' which constitute a portion of the cosmical bodies revolving in\r\nindependent orbits round the Sun.  If we assume an equable distribution of\r\ntheir orbits, and the limits of their perihelia, or greatest proximities to\r\nthe Sun, and the possibility of their remaining invisible to the inhabitants\r\nof the Earth, and base our estimates on the rules of the calculus of\r\nprobabilities, we shall obtain as the result an amount of myriads perfectly\r\nastonishing.  Kepler, with his usual animation of expression, said that\r\nthere were more comets in the regions of space than fishes in the depths of\r\nthe ocean.  As yet, however, there are scarcely one hundred and fifty whose\r\npaths have been calculated, if we may assume at six or seven hundred the\r\nnumber of comets whose appearance and passage through known constellations\r\nhave been ascertained by more or less precise observations.  While the\r\nso-called classical nations of the West, the Greeks and Romans, although\r\nthey may occasionally have indicated the position in which a comet first\r\nappeared, never afford any information regarding its apparent path, the\r\ncopious literature of the Chinese (who observed nature carefully, and\r\nrecorded with accuracy what they saw) contains circumstantial notices of the\r\nconstellations through which each comet was observed to pass.  These notices\r\ngo back to more than five hundred years before the Christian era, and many\r\nof them are still found to be of value in astronomical observations.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The first comets of whose orbits we have any knowledge, and\r\nwhich were calculated from Chinese observations, are those of 240 (under\r\nGordian II.), 539 (under Justinian), 565, 568, 574, 837, 1337, and 1385.\r\nSee John Russell Hind, in Schum., 'Astron. Nachr.', 1843, No. 498.  While\r\nthe comet of 837 (which, according to Du Sejour, continued during\r\ntwenty-four hours within a distance of 2,000,000 miles from the Earth)\r\nterrified Louis I. of France to that degree that he busied himself in\r\nbuilding churches and founding monastic establishments, in the hope of\r\nappeasing the evils threatened by its appearance, the Chinese astronomers\r\nmade observations on the path of this cosmical body, whose tail extended\r\nover a space of 60 degrees, appearing sometimes single and sometimes\r\nmultiple.  The first comet that has been calculated solely from European\r\nobservations was that of 1456, known as Halley's comet, from the belief\r\nlong, but erroneously, entertained that the period when it was first\r\nobserved by that astronomer was its first and only well-attested appearance.\r\n See Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1836, p. 204, and Langier, 'Comptes Rendus\r\ndes Seances de l'Acad.', 1843, t. xvi., 1006.\r\n\r\n\r\np 100\r\nAlthough comets have a smaller mass than any other cosmical bodies -- being,\r\naccording to our present knowledge, probably not equal to 1/5000th part of\r\nthe Earth's mass -- yet they occupy the largest space, as their tails in\r\nseveral instances extend over many millions of miles.  The cone of luminous\r\nvapor which radiates from them has been found, in some cases (as in 1680 and\r\n1811), to equal the length of the Earth's distance from the Sun, forming a\r\nline that intersects both the orbits of Venus and Mercury.  It is even\r\nprobable that the vapor of the tails of comets mingled with our atmosphere\r\nin the years 1819 and 1823.\r\n\r\nComets exhibit such diversities of form, which appear rather to appertain to\r\nthe individual than the class, that a description of one of these \"wandering\r\nlight-clouds,\" as they were already called by Xenophanes and Theon of\r\nAlexandria, contemporaries of Pappus, can only be applied with caution to\r\nanother.  The faintest telescopic comets are generally devoid of visible\r\ntails, and resemble Herschel's nebulous stars.  They appear like circular\r\nnebulae of faintly-glimmering vapor, with the light concentrted toward the\r\nmiddle.  This is the most simple type; but it can not, however, be regarded\r\nas rudimentary, since it might equally be the type of an older cosmical\r\nbody, exhausted by exhalation.  In the larger comets we may distinguish both\r\nthe so-called \"head\" or \"nucleus,\" and the single or multiple tail, which is\r\ncharacteristically denominated by the Chinese astronomers \"the brush\"\r\n('sui').  The nucleus generally presents no definite outline, although, in a\r\nfew rare cases, it appears like a star of the first or second magnitude, and\r\nhas even been seen in bright sunshine;* as,\r\np 101\r\nfor instance, in the large comets of 1402, 1532, 1577, 1744, and 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 209, 211.  The phenomenon of the\r\ntail of a comet being visible in bright sunshine, which is recorded of the\r\ncomet of 1402, occurred again in the case of the large comet of 1843, whose\r\nnucleus and tail were seen in North America on the 28th of February\r\n(according to the testimony of J. G. Clarke, of Portland, state of Maine),\r\nbetween 1 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon.(a)  The distance of the very dense\r\nnucleus from the sun's light admitted of being measured with much exactness.\r\n The nucleus and tail appeared like a very pure white cloud, a darker space\r\nintervening between the tail and the nucleus.  ('Amer. Journ. of Science',\r\nvol. xiv., No. 1, p. 229.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  (a)  [The translator was at New Bedford, Massachusetts, U.S., on\r\nthe 28th February, 1843, and distinctly saw the comet, between 1 and 2 in\r\nthe afternoon.  The sky at the time was intensely blue, and the sun shining\r\nwith a dazzling brightness unknown in European climates.] -- Tr\r\n\r\n\r\nThis latter circumstance indicates, in particular individuals, a denser\r\nmass, capable of reflecting light with greater intensity.  Even in\r\nHerschel's large telescope, only two comets, that discovered in Sicily in\r\n1807, and the splendid one of 1811, exhibited well-defined disks;* the one\r\nat an angle of 1 second, and the other at 0.77 seconds, whence the true\r\ndiameters are assumed to be 536 and 428 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *'Phil. Trans.' for 1808, Part ii., p. 155, and for 1812, Part\r\ni., p. 118.  The diameters found by Herschel for the nuclei were 538 and 428\r\nEnglish miles.  For the magnitudes of the comets of 1798 and 1805, see\r\nArago, 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 203.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diameters of the less well-defined nuclei of the comets of 1798 and 1805\r\ndid not appear to exceed 24 or 28 miles.\r\n\r\nIn several comets that have been investigated with great care, especially in\r\nthe above-named one of 1811, which continued visible for so long a period,\r\nthe nucleus and its nebulous envelope were entirely separated from the tail\r\nby a darker space.  The intensity of light in the nucleus of comets does not\r\naugment toward the center in any uniform degree, brightly shining zones\r\nbeing in many cases separated by concentric nebulous envelopes.  The tails\r\nsometimes appear single, sometimes, although more rarely, double; and in the\r\ncomets of 1807 and 1843 the branches were of different lengths; in one\r\ninstance (1744) the tail had six branches, the whole forming an angle of 60\r\ndegrees.  The tails have been sometimes straight, sometimes curved, either\r\ntoward both sides, or toward the side appearing to us as the exterior (as in\r\n1811), or convex toward the direction in which the comet is moving (as in\r\nthat of 1618); and sometimes the tail has even appeared like a flame in\r\nmotion.  The tails are always turned away from the sun, so that their line\r\nof prolongation passes through its center; a fact which, according to Edward\r\nBiot, was noticed by the Chinese astronomers as early as 837, but was first\r\ngenerally made known in Europe by Fracastoro and Peter Apian in the\r\nsixteenth century.  These emanations may be regarded as conoidal envelopes\r\nof greater of less thickness,\r\np 102\r\nand, considered in this manner, they furnish a simple explanation of many of\r\nthe remarkable optical phenomena already spoken of.\r\n\r\nComets are not only characteristically different in form, some being\r\nentirely without a visible tail, while others have a tail of immense length\r\n(as in the instance of the comet of 1618, whose tail measured 104 degrees),\r\nbut we also see the same comets undergoing successive and rapidly-changing\r\nprocesses of configuration.  These variations of form have been most\r\naccurately and admirably described in the comet of 1744, by Hensius, at St.\r\nPetersburg, and in Halley's comet, on its last reappearance in 1835, by\r\nBessel, at Konigsberg.  A more or less well-defined tuft of rays emanated\r\nfrom that part of the nucleus which was turned toward the Sun; and the rays\r\nbeing bent backward, formed a part of the tail.  The nucleus of Halley's\r\ncomet; with its emanations, presented the appearance of a burning rocket,\r\nthe end of which was turned sideways by the force of the wind.  The rays\r\nissuing from the head were seen by Arago and myself, at the Observatory at\r\nParis, to assume very different forms on successive nights.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, 'Des Changements physiques de la Comete de Halley du\r\n15-23 Oct., 1835.  'Annuaire', 1836, p. 218, 221.  The ordinary direction of\r\nthe emanations was noticed even in Nero's time.  \"Comae radios solis\r\neffugiunt.\" -- Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest.', vii., 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Konigsberg astronomer concluded from many measurements, and from\r\ntheoretical considerations, \"that the cone of light issuing from the comet\r\ndeviated considerably both to the right and the left of the true direction\r\nof the Sun, but that it always returned to that direction, and passed over\r\nto the opposite side, so that both the cone of light and the body of the\r\ncomet from whence it emanated experienced a rotatory, or, rather, a\r\nvibratory motion in the plane of the orbit.\"  He finds that \"the attractive\r\nforce exercised by the Sun on heavy bodies is inadequate to explain such\r\nvibrations, and is of opinion that they indicate a polar force, which turns\r\none semi-diameter of the comet toward the Sun, and strives to turn the\r\nopposite side away from that luminary.  The magnetic polarity possessed by\r\nthe Earth may present some analogy to this, and, should the Sun have an\r\nopposite polarity, an influence might be manifested, resulting in the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes.\"  This is not the place to enter more fully\r\nupon the grounds on which explanations of this subject have been based; but\r\nobservations so remarkable,* and views of so exalted\r\np 103\r\na character, regarding the most wonderful class of the cosmical bodies\r\nbelonging to our solar system, ought not to be entirely passed over in this\r\nsketch of a general picture of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bessel, in Schumacher, 'Astr. Nachr.', 1836, No. 300-302, s.\r\n188, 192, 197, 200, 202, und 230.  Also in Schumacher, 'Jahrb.', 1837, s.\r\n149, 168.  William Herschel, in his observations on the beautiful comet of\r\n1811, believed that he had discovered evidences of the rotation of the\r\nnucleus and tail ('Phil. Trans.' for 1812, Part i., p. 140).  Dunlop, at\r\nParamatta thought the same with reference to the third comet of 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough, as a rule, the tails of comets increase in magnitude and\r\nbrilliancy in the vicinity of the sun, and are directed away from that\r\ncentral body, yet the comet of 1823 offered the remarkable example of two\r\ntails, one of which was turned toward the sun, and the other away from it,\r\nforming with each other an angle of 160 degrees.  Modifications of polarity\r\nand the unequal manner of its distribution, and of the direction in which it\r\nis conducted, may in this rare instance have occasioned a double, unchecked,\r\ncontinuous emanation of nebulous matter.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bessel, in 'Astr.

According to his views, the innumerable\r\nquantity of stars which compose this starry zone give out a self-luminous,\r\nincandescent matter.  The nebulous belt which separates the different\r\nportions of the vault of heaven was therefore regarded by the Stagirite as a\r\nlarge comet, the substance of which was incessantly being renewed.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Aristot., 'Meteor.', i., 8, 11-14, und 19-21 (ed.

Since\r\nAristotle exercised so great an influence throughout the whole of the Middle\r\nAges, it is very much to be regretted that he was so averse to those grander\r\nviews of the elder Pythagoreans, which inculcated ideas so nearly\r\napproximating to truth respecting the structure of the universe.  He asserts\r\nthat comets are transitory meteors belonging to our atmosphere in the very\r\nbook in which he cites the opinion of the Pythagorean school, according to\r\nwhich these cosmical bodies are supposed to be planets having long periods\r\nof revolution.  (Aristot., i., 6, 2.)  This Pythagorean doctrine, which,\r\naccording to the testimony of Apollonius Myndius, was still more ancient,\r\nhaving originated with the Chaldeans, passed over to the Romans, who in this\r\ninstance, as was their usual practice, were merely the copiers of others.\r\nThe Myndian philosopher describes the path of comets as directed toward the\r\nupper and remote regions of heaven.  Hence Seneca says, in his 'Nat.\r\nQuaest.', vii., 17:  \"Cometes non est species falsa, sed proprium sidus\r\nsicut solis et lunae:  altiora mundi secat et tunc demum apparet quum in\r\nimum cursum sui venit;\" and again (at vii., 27), \"Cometes aternos esse et\r\nsortis ejusdem, cujus caetera (sidera), etiamsi faciem illis non habent\r\nsimilem.\"  Pliny (ii., 25) also refers to Apollonius Myndius, when he says,\r\n\"Sunt qui et haec sidera perpetua esse credant suoque ambitu ire, sed non\r\nnisi relicta a sole cerni.\"\r\n\r\n\r\np 104\r\nThe occulation of the fixed stars by the nucleus of a comet, or by its\r\ninnermost vaporous envelopes, might throw some light on the physical\r\ncharacter of these wonderful bodies; but we are unfortunately deficient in\r\nobservations by which we may be assured* that the occulation was perfectly\r\ncentral; for, as it has already been observed, the parts of the envelope\r\ncontiguous to the nucleus are alternately composed of layers of dense or\r\nvery attenuated vapor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Olbers, in 'Astr. Nachr.', 1828, s. 157, 184.  Arago, 'De la\r\nConstitution physique des Cometes; Annuaire de' 1832, p. 203, 208.  The\r\nancients were struck by the phenomenon that it was possible to see through\r\ncomets as through a flame.  The earliest evidence to be met with of stars\r\nhaving been seen through comets is that of Democritus (Aristot., 'Meteor.',\r\ni., 6, 11), and the statement leads Aristotle to make the not unimportant\r\nremark, that he himself had observed the occulation of one of the stars of\r\nGemini by Jupiter.  Seneca only speaks decidedly of the transparence of the\r\ntail of comets.  \"We may see,\" says he, \"stars through a comet as through a\r\ncloud ('Nat. Quaest.', vii., 18); but we can ony see through the rays of the\r\ntail, and not through the body of the comet itself:  'non in ea parte qua\r\nsidus ipsum est spissi et solidi ignis, sed qua rarus splendor occurrit et\r\nin crines dispergitur.  Per intervalla ignium, non er ipsos, vides\" (vii.,\r\n26).  The last remark is unnecessary, since, as Galileo observed in the\r\n'Saggiatore (Lettera a Monsignor Cesarini', 1619), we can certainly see\r\nthrough a flame when it is not of too great a thickness'.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the carefully conducted measurements of Bessel prove,\r\nbeyond all doubt, that on the 29th of September, 1835, the light of a star\r\nof the tenth magnitude, which was then at a distance of 7\".78 from the\r\ncentral point of the head of Halley's comet, passed through very dense\r\nnebulous matter, without experiencing any deflection during its passage.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bessel, in the 'Astron. Nachr.', 1836, No. 301, s. 204, 206.\r\nStruve, in 'Recueil des Mem. de l'Acad. de St. Peterab.', 1836, p. 140, 143,\r\nand 'Astr. Nachr.', 1836, No. 303, s. 238, writes as follows:  \"At Dorpat\r\nthe star was in conjunction only 2\".2 from the brightest point of the comet.\r\n The star remained continually visible, and its light was not perceptibly\r\ndiminished, while the nucleus of the comet seemed to be almost extinguished\r\nbefore the radiance of the small star of the ninth or tenth magnitude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf such an absence of refracting power must be ascribed to the nucleus of a\r\ncomet, we can scarcely regard the matter composing comets as a gaseous\r\nfluid.  The question here arises whether this absence of refracting power\r\nmay not be owing to the extreme tenuity of the fluid; or does the comet\r\nconsist of separated particles, constituting a cosmical stratum of clouds,\r\nwhich, like the clouds of our atmosphere, that exercise no influence on the\r\np 105\r\nzenith distance of the stars, does not affect the ray of light passing\r\nthrough it?  In the passage of a comet over a star, a more or less\r\nconsiderable diminution of light has often been observed; but this has been\r\njustly ascribed to the brightness of the ground from which the star seems to\r\nstand forth during the passage of the comet.\r\n\r\nThe most important and decisive observations that we possess on the nature\r\nand the light of comets are due to Arago's polarization experiments.  His\r\npolariscope instructs us regarding the physical constitution of the Sun and\r\ncomets, indicating whether a ray that reaches us from a distance of many\r\nmillions of miles transmits light directly or by reflection; and if the\r\nformer, whther the source of light is a solid, a liquid, or a gaseous body.\r\nHis apparatus was used at the Paris Observatory in examining the light of\r\nCapella and that of the great comet of 1819.  The latter showed polarized,\r\nand therefore reflected light, while the fixed star, as was to be expected,\r\nappeared to be a self-luminous sun.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the 3d of July, 1819, Arago made the first attempt to\r\nanalyze the light of comets by polarization, on the evening of the sudden\r\nappearance of the great comet.  I was present at the Paris Observatory, and\r\nwas fully convinced, as were also Matthieu and the late Bouvard of the\r\ndissimilarity in the intensity of the light seen in the polariscope, when\r\nthe instrument received cometary light.  When it received light from\r\nCapella, which was near the comet, and at an equal altitude, the images were\r\nof equal intensity.  On the reappearance of Halley's comet in 1835, the\r\ninstrument was altered so as to give, according to Arago's chromatic\r\npolarization, two images of complementary colors (green and red).  ('Annales\r\nde Chimie', t. xiii., p. 108; 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 216.)  \"We must conclude\r\nfrom these observations,\" says Arago, \"that the cometary light was not\r\nentirely composed of rays having the properties of direct light, there being\r\nlight which was reflected specularly or polarized, that is, coming from the\r\nsun.  It can not be stated with absolute certainty that comets shine only\r\nwith borrowed light, for bodies, in becoming self-luminous, do not, on that\r\naccount, lose the power of reflecting foreign light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existance of polarized cometary light announced itself not only by the\r\ninequality of the images, but was proved with greater certainty on the\r\nreappearance of Halley's comet, in the year 1835, by the more striking\r\ncontrast of the complementary colors, deduced from the laws of chromatic\r\npolarization discovered by Arago in 1811.  These beautiful experiments still\r\nleave it undecided whether, in addition to this reflected solar light,\r\ncomets may not have light of their own.  Even in the case of the planets,\r\nas, for instance, in Venus, an evolution of independent light seems very\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nThe variable intensity of light in comets can not always be\r\np 106\r\nexplained by the position of their orbits and their distance from the Sun.\r\nIt would seem to indicate, in some individuals, the existence of an inherent\r\nprocess of condensation, and an increased or diminished capacity of\r\nreflecting borrowed light.  In the comet of 1618, and in that which has a\r\nperiod of three years, it was observed first by Hevelius that the nucleus of\r\nthe comet diminished at its perihelion and enlarged at its aphelion, a fact\r\nwhich, after remaining long unheeded, was again noticed by the talented\r\nastronomer Valz at Nismes.  The regularity of the change of volume,\r\naccording to the different degrees of distance from the Sun, appears very\r\nstriking.  The physical explanation of the phenomenon can not, however, be\r\nsought in the condensed layers of cosmical vapor occurring in the vicinity\r\nof the Sun, since it is difficult to imagine the nebulous envelope of the\r\nnucleus of the comet to be vesicular and impervious to the other.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 217-220.  Sir John Herschel,\r\n'Astron.', 488.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dissimilar eccentricity of the orbits of comets has, in recent times\r\n(1819), in the most brilliant manner enriched our knowledge of the solar\r\nsystem.  Encke has discovered the existence of a comet of so short a period\r\nof revolution that it remains entirely within the limits of our planetary\r\nsystem, attaining its aphelion between the orbits of the smaller planets and\r\nthat of Jupiter.  Its eccentricity must be assumed at 0.845, that of Juno\r\n(which has the greatest eccentricity of any of the planets) being 0.255.\r\nEncke's comet has several times, although with difficulty, been observed by\r\nthe naked eye, as in Europe in 1819, and according to Rumker, in New Holland\r\nin 1822.  Its period of revolution is about 3 1/3d years; but, from a\r\ncareful comparison of the epochs of its return to its perihelion, the\r\nremarkable fact has been discovered that these periods have diminished in\r\nthe most regular manner between the years 1786 and 1838, the diminution\r\namounting, in the course of 52 years, to about 1 3/10th days.  The attempt\r\nto bring into unison the results of observation and calculation in the\r\ninvestigation of all the planetary disturbances, with the view of explaining\r\nthis phenomenon, has led to the adoption of the very probable hypothesis\r\nthat there exists dispersed in space a vaporous substance capable of acting\r\nas a resisting medium.  This matter diminished the tangential force, and\r\nwith it the major axis of the comet's orbit.  The value of the constant of\r\nthe resistance appears to be somewhat different before and after the\r\nperihelion; and this may, perhaps, be ascribed\r\np 107\r\nto the altered form of the small nebulous star in the vicinity of the Sun,\r\nand to the action of the unequal density of the strata of cosmical ether.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Encke, in the 'Astronomiche Nachrichten', 1843, No. 489, s.\r\n130-132.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese facts, and the investigations to which they have led, belong to the\r\nmost interesting results of modern astronomy.  Encke's comet has been the\r\nmeans of leading astronomers to a more exact investigation of Jupiter's mass\r\n(a most important point with reference to the calculation of perturbations);\r\nand, more recently, the course of this comet has obtained for us the first\r\ndetermination, although only an approximative one, of a smaller mass for\r\nMercury.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Encke's comet, which had a period of only 3 1/3d years, was\r\nspeedily followed, in 1826, by that of another, Biela's comet, whose period\r\nof revolution is 6 3/4th years, and which is likewise planetary, having its\r\naphelion beyond the orbit of Jupiter, but within that of Saturn.  It has a\r\nfainter light than Encke's comet, and, like the latter, its motion is\r\ndirect, while Halley's comet moves in a course opposite to that pursued by\r\nthe planets.  Biela's comet presents the first certain example of the orbit\r\nof a comet intersecting that of the Earth.  This position, with reference to\r\nour planet, may therefore be productive of danger, if we can associate an\r\nidea of danger with so extraordinary a natural phenomenon, whose history\r\npresents no parallel, and the results of which we are consequently unable\r\ncorrectly to estimate.  Small masses endowed with enormous velocity may\r\ncertainly exercise a considerable power; but Laplace has shown that the mass\r\nof the comet of 1770 is probably not equal to 1/5000th that of the Earth, or\r\nabout 1/2000th that of the Moon.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde', p. 216, 237.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not confound the passage of Biela's comet through the Earth's orbit\r\nwith its proximity to, or collision with our globe.  When this passage took\r\nplace, on the 29th of October, 1832, it required a full month before the\r\nEarth would reach the point of intersection of the two orbits.  These two\r\ncomets of short periods of revolution also intersect each other, and it has\r\nbeen justly observed,* that amid the many perturbations experienced by such\r\nsmall bodies from the largr planets, there is a 'possibility' -- supposing a\r\nmeeting of these comets to occur in October -- that the inhabitants of the\r\nEarth may witness the extraordinary spectacle of an encounter between two\r\ncosmical bodies, and possibly of their reciprocal penetration and\r\namalgamation, or of their destruction by means of exhausting emanations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Littrow, 'Beschreibende Astron.', 1835, s. 274.  On the inner\r\ncomet recently discovered by M. Faye, at the Observatory of Paris, and whose\r\neccentricity is 0.551, its distance at its perihelion 1.690, and its\r\ndistance at its aphelion 5.832, see Schumacher, 'Astron. Nachr.', 1844, No.\r\n495.  Regarding the supposed identity of the comet of 1766 with the third\r\ncomet of 1819, see 'Astr. Nachr.', 1833, No. 239; and on the identity of the\r\ncomet of 1743 and the fourth comet of 1819, see No. 237 or the last\r\nmentioned work.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents of this nature, resulting either from deflection occasioned by\r\ndisturbing masses or primevally intersecting orbits, must have been of\r\nfrequent occurrence in the course of millions of years in the immeasurable\r\nregions of ethereal space; but they must be regarded as isolated\r\noccurrences, exercising no more general or alternative effects on cosmical\r\nrelations than the breaking forth or extinction of a volcano within the\r\nlimited sphere of our Earth.\r\n\r\nA third interior comet, having likewise a short period of revolution was\r\ndiscovered by Faye on the 22d of November, 1843, at the Observatory at\r\nParis.  Its elliptic path, which approaches much more nearly to a circle\r\nthan that of any other known comet, is included within the orbits of Mars\r\nand Saturn.  This comet, therefore, which, according to Goldschmidt, passes\r\nbeyond the orbit of Jupiter, is one of the few whose perihelia are beyond\r\nMars.  Its period of revolution is 7 29/100 years, and it is not improbable\r\nthat the form of its present orbit may be owing to its great approximation\r\nto Jupiter at the close of the year 1839.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the comets in their inclosed elliptic orbits as members of\r\nour solar system, and with respect to the length of their major axes, the\r\namount of their eccentricity, and their periods of revolution, we shall\r\nprobably find that the three planetary comets of Encke, Biela, and Faye are\r\nmost nearly approached in these respects, first, by the comet discovered in\r\n1766 by Messier, and which is regarded by Clausen as identical with the\r\nthird comet of 1819; and next, by the fourth comet of the last-mentioned\r\nyear, discovered by Blaupain, but considered by Clausen as identical with\r\nthat of the year 1743, and whose orbit appears, like that of Lexell's comet,\r\nto have suffered great variations from the proximity and attraction of\r\nJupiter.  The two last-named comets would likewise seem to have a period of\r\nrevolution not exceeding five or six years, and their aphelia are in the\r\nvicinity of Jupiter's orbit.  Among the comets that have a period of\r\nrevolution of from seventy to\r\np 109\r\nseventy-six years, the first in point of importance with respect to\r\ntheoretical and physical astronomy is Halley's comet, whose last appearance,\r\nin 1835, was much less brilliant than was to be expected from preceding\r\nones; next we would notice Olbers's comet, discovered on the 6th of March,\r\n1815; and, lastly, the comet discovered by Pons in the year 1812, and whose\r\nelliptic orbit has been determined by Encke.  The two latter comets were\r\ninvisible to the naked eye.  We now know with certainty of nine returns of\r\nHalley's large comet, it having recently been proved by Laugier's\r\ncalculations*, that in the Chinese table of comets, first made known to us\r\nby Edward Biot, the comet of 1378 is identical with Halley's; its periods of\r\nrevolution have varied in the interval between 1378 and 1835 from 74.91 to\r\n77.58 years, the mean being 76.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Laugier, in the 'Comptes Rendus des Seances de l'Academie',\r\n1843, t. xvi., p. 1006.\r\n\r\n\r\nA host of other comets may be contrasted with the cosmical bodies of which\r\nwe have spoken, requiring several thousand years to perform their orbits,\r\nwhich it is difficult to determine with any degree of certainty.  The\r\nbeautiful comet of 1811 requires, according to Argelander, a period of 3065\r\nyears for its revolution, and the colossal one of 1680 as much as 8800\r\nyears, according to Encke's calculation.  These bodies respectively recede,\r\ntherefore, 21 and 44 times further than Uranus from the Sun, that is to say,\r\n33,600 and 70,400 millions of miles.  At this enormous distance the\r\nattractive force of the Sun is still manifested; but while the velocity of\r\nthe comet of 1680 at its perihelion is 212 miles in a second, that is,\r\nthirteen times greater than that of the Earth, it scarcely moves ten feet in\r\nthe second when at its aphelion.  This velocity is only three times greater\r\nthan that of water in our most sluggish European rivers, and equal only to\r\nhalf that which I have observed in the Cassiquiare, a branch of the Orinoco.\r\n It is highly probable that, among the innumerable host of uncalculated or\r\nundiscovered comets, there are many whose major axes greatly exceed that of\r\nthe comet of 1680.  In order to form some idea by numbers, I do not say of\r\nthe sphere of attraction, but of the distance in space of a fixed star, or\r\nother sun, from the aphelion of the comet of 1680 (the furthest receding\r\ncosmical body with which we are acquainted in our solar system), it must be\r\nremembered that, according to the most recent determinations of parallaxes,\r\nthe nearest fixed star is full 250 times further removed from our sun than\r\nthe comet in its aphelion.  The comet's distance is only 44\r\np 110\r\ntimes that of Uranus, while 'a' Centauri is 11,000 and 61 Cygni 31,000 times\r\nthat of Uranus, according to Bessel's determinations.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the greatest distances of comets from the central body, it\r\nnow remains for us to notice instances of the greatest proximity hitherto\r\nmeasured.  Lexell and Burckhardt's comet of 1770, so celebrated on account\r\nof the disturbances it experienced from Jupiter, has approached the Earth\r\nwithin a smaller distance than any other comet.  On the 28th of June, 1770,\r\nits distance from the Earth was ony six times than of the Moon.  The same\r\ncomet passed twice, viz., in 1769 and 1779, through the system of Jupiter's\r\nfour satellites without producing the slightest notable change in the\r\nwell-known orbits of these bodies.  The great comet of 1680 approached at\r\nits perihelion eight or nine times nearer to the surface of the Sun than\r\nLexell's comet did to that of our Earth, being on the 17th of December a\r\nsixth part of the Sun's diameter, or seven tenths of the distance of the\r\nMoon from that luminary.  Perihelia occurring beyond the orbit of Mars can\r\nseldom be observed by the inhabitants of the Earth, owing to the faintness\r\nof the light of distant comets; and among those already calculated the comet\r\nof 1729 is the only one which has its perihelion between the orbits of\r\nPallas and Jupiter; it was even observed beyond the latter.\r\n\r\nSince scientific knowledge, although frequently blended with vague and\r\nsuperficial views, has been more extensively diffused through wider circles\r\nof social life, apprehensions of the possible evils threatened by comets\r\nhave acquired more weight as their direction has become more definite.  The\r\ncertainty that there are within the known planetary orbits comets which\r\nrevisit our regions of space at short intervals -- that great disturbances\r\nhave been produced by Jupiter and Saturn in their orbits, by which such as\r\nwere apparently harmless have been converted into dangerous bodies -- the\r\nintersection of the Earth's orbit by Biela's comet -- the cosmical vapor,\r\nwhich, acting as a resisting and impeding medium, tends to contract all\r\norbits -- the individual difference of comets, which would seem to indicate\r\nconsiderable decreasing gradations in the quantity of the mass of the\r\nnucleus, are all considerations more than equivalent, both as to number and\r\nvariety, to the vague fears entertained in early ages of the general\r\nconflagration of the world by 'flaming swords', and stars with 'fiery\r\nstreaming hair'.  As the consolatory considerations which may be derived\r\nfrom the calculus of probabilities address themselves to reason and to\r\np 111\r\nmeditative understanding only, and not to the imagination or to a desponding\r\ncondition of mind, modern science has been accused, and not entirely without\r\nreason, of not attempting to allay apprehensions which it has been the very\r\nmeans of exciting.  It is an inherent attribute of the human mind to\r\nexperience fear, and not hope or joy, at the aspect of that which is\r\nunexpected and extraordinary.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Fries, 'Vorlesungen uber die Sternkunde', 1833, s. 262-267\r\n(Lectures on the Science of Astronomy).  An infelicitously chosen instance\r\nof the good omen of a comet may be found in Seneca, 'Nat. Quest.', vii., 17\r\nand 21.  The philosopher thus writes of the comet:  \"Quem nos Neronis\r\nprincipatu latissimo vidimus et qui cometis detraxit infamiam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strange form of a large comet, its faint nebulous light, and its sudden\r\nappearance in the vault of heaven, have in all regions been almost\r\ninvariably regarded by the people at large as some new and formidable agent\r\ninimical to the existing state of things.  The sudden occurrence and short\r\nduration of the phenomenon lead to the belief of some equally rapid\r\nreflection of its agency in terrestrial matters, whose varied nature renders\r\nit easy to find events that may be regarded as the fulfillment of the evil\r\nforetold by the appearance of these mysterious cosmical bodies.  In our own\r\nday, however, the public mind has taken another and more cheerful, although\r\nsingular, turn with regard to comets; and in the German vineyards in the\r\nbeautiful valleys of the Rhine and Moselle, a belief has arisen, ascribing\r\nto these once ill-omened bodies a beneficial influence on the ripening of\r\nthe vine.  The evidence yielded by experience, of which there is no lack in\r\nthese days, when comets may so frequently be observed, has not been able to\r\nshake the common belief in the meteorological myth of the existence of\r\nwandering stars capable of radiating heat.\r\n\r\nThis material taken from pages 111- 147\r\n\r\nCOSMOS: A Sketch of the Physical Description of the Universe, Vol. 1\r\nby Alexander von Humboldt\r\n\r\nTranslated by E C Otte\r\n\r\nfrom the 1858 Harper & Brothers edition of Cosmos, volume 1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom comets I would pass to the consideration of a far more enigmatical\r\nclass of agglomerated matter -- the smallest of all asteroids, to which we\r\napply the name 'aërolites', or 'meteoric stones',* when they reach our\r\natmosphere in a fragmentary condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * (Much valuable information may be obtained regarding the\r\norigin and composition of aërolites or meteoric stones in Memoirs on the\r\nsubject, by Baumbeer and other writers, in the numbers of Poggendorf's\r\n'Annalen', from 1845 to the present time.) -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I should seem to dwell on the specific enumeration of these bodies, and\r\nof comets, longer than the general nature of this work might warrant, I have\r\nnot done so undesignedly.  The diversity existing in the individual\r\ncharacteristics of comets has already been noticed.  The imperfect knowledge\r\nwe possess of their physical character renders it\r\np 112\r\ndiifficult in a work like the present, to give the proper degree of\r\ncircumstantiality to the phenomena, which, although of frequent recurrence,\r\nhave been observed with such various degrees of accuracy, or to separate the\r\nnecessary from the accidental.  It is only with respect to measurements and\r\ncomputations that the astronomy of comets has made any marked advancement,\r\nand, consequently, a scientific consideration of these bodies must be\r\nlimited to a specification of the differences of physiognomy and\r\nconformation in the nucleus and tail, the instances of great approximation\r\nto other cosmical bodies, and of the extremes in the length of their orbits\r\nand in their periods of revolution.  A faithful delineation of these\r\nphenomena, as well as of those which we proceed to consider, can only be\r\ngiven by sketching individual features with the animated circumstantiality\r\nof reality.\r\n\r\nShooting stars, fire-balls, and meteoric stones are, with great probability,\r\nregarded as small bodies moving with planetary velocity, and revolving in\r\nobedience to the laws of general gravity in conic sections round the Sun.\r\nWhen these masses meet the Earth in their course, and are attracted by it,\r\nthey enter within the limits of our atmosphere in a luminous condition, and\r\nfrequently let fall more or less strongly heated stony fragments, covered\r\nwith a shining black crust.  When we enter into a careful investigation of\r\nthe facts observed at those epochs when showers of shooting stars fell\r\nperiodically in Cumana in 1799, and in North America during the years 1833\r\nand 1834, we shall find that 'fire-balls' can not be considered separately\r\nfrom shooting stars.  Both these phenomena are frequently not only\r\nsimultaneous and blended together, but they likewise are often found to\r\nmerge into one another, the one phenomenon gradually assuming the character\r\nof the other alike with respect to the size of their disks, the emanation of\r\nsparks, and the velocities of their motion.  Although exploding smoking\r\nluminous fire-balls are sometimes seen, even in the brightness of tropical\r\ndaylight,* equaling in size the apparent\r\np 113\r\ndiameter of the Moon, innumerable quantities of shooting stars have, on the\r\nother hand, been observed to fall in forms of such extremely small\r\ndimensions that they appear only as moving points or 'phosphorescent\r\nlines.'**\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *A friend of mine, much accustomed to exact trigonometrical\r\nmeasurements, was in the year 1788 at Popayan, a city which is 2 degrees 26'\r\nnorth latitude, lying at an elevation of 5583 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, and at noon, when the sun was shining brightly in a cloudless sky, saw\r\nhis room lighted up by a fire-ball.  He had his back to the window at the\r\ntime, and on turning round, perceived that great part of the path traversed\r\nby the fire-ball was still illuminated by the brightest radiance.  Different\r\nnations have had the most various terms to express these phenomena:  The\r\nGermans use the word 'Sternschnuppe', literally 'star snuff' -- an\r\nexpression well suited to the physical views of the vulgar in former times,\r\naccording to which, the lights in the firmament were said to undergo a\r\nprocess of 'snuffing' or cleaning; and other nations generally adopt a term\r\nexpressive of a 'shot' or 'fall' of stars, as the Swedish 'stjernifall', the\r\nItalian 'stella cadente', and the English 'star shoot.'  In the woody\r\ndistrict of the Orinoco, on the dreary banks of the Cassiquiare, I heard the\r\nnatives in the Mission of Vasiva use terms still more inelegant than the\r\nGerman 'star snuff.'  ('Relation Historique du Voy. aux Régions Equinox.',\r\nt. ii., p. 513.)  These same tribes term the pearly drops of dew which cover\r\nthe beautiful leaves of the heliconia 'star spit.'  In the Lithuanian\r\nmythology, the imagination of the people has embodied its ideas of the\r\nnature and signification of falling stars under nobler and more graceful\r\nsymbols.  The Parcæ, 'Werpeja', weave in heaven for the new-born child its\r\nthread of fate, attaching each separate thread to a star.  When death\r\napproaches the person, the thread is rent, and the star wanes and sinks to\r\nthe earth.  Jacob Grimm, 'Deutsche Mythologie', 1843, s. 685.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** According to the testimony of Professor Denison Olmsted, of\r\nYale College, New Haven, Connecticut.  (See Poggend., 'Annalen der Physik',\r\nbd. xxx., s. 194.)  Kepler, who excluded fire-balls and shooting stars from\r\nthe domain of astronomy, because they were, according to his views, \"meteors\r\narising from the exhalations of the earth, and blending with the higher\r\nether,\" expresses himself, however, generally with much caution.  He says:\r\n\"Stellæ cadentes sunt materia viscida inflammata.  Earum aliquæ inter\r\ncadendum absumuntur, aliquæ verè in terram cadunt, pondere suo tractæ.\r\nNec est dissimile vero, quasdam conglobatas esse ex materia fæculentâ, in\r\nipsam auram ætheream immixta:  exque aëtheris regione, tractu rectilineo,\r\nper aërem trajicere, ceu minutos competas, occultâ causa motus\r\nutrorumque.\" -- Kepler, 'Epit. Astron. Copernicanæ', t. i., p. 80.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt still remains undertermined whether the many luminous bodies that shoot\r\nacross the sky may not vary in their nature.  On my return from the\r\nequinoctial zones, I was impressed with an idea that in the torrid regions\r\nof the tropics I had more frequently than in our colder latitudes seen\r\nshooting stars fall as if from a height of twelve or fifteen thousand feet;\r\nthat they were of brighter colors, and left a more brilliant line of light\r\nin their track; but this impression was no doubt owing to the greater\r\ntransparency of the tropical atmosphere*, which enables the eye to penetrate\r\nfurther into distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'Relation Historique', t. i., p. 80, 213, 527.  If in falling\r\nstars, as in comets, we distinguish between the head or nucleus and the\r\ntail, we shall find that the greater transparency of the atmosphere in\r\ntropical climates is evinced in the greater length and brilliancy of the\r\ntail which may be observed in those latitudes.  The phenomenon is therefore\r\nnot necessarily more frequent there, because it is oftener seen and\r\ncontinues longer visible.  The influence exercised on shooting stars by the\r\ncharacter of the atmosphere is shown occasionally even in our temperate\r\nzone, and at very small distances apart.  Wartmann relates that on the\r\noccasion of a November phenomenon at two places lying very near each other,\r\nGeneva and Aux Planchettes, the number of the meteors counted were as 1 to\r\n7.  (Wartmann, 'Mém. sur les Etoiles filantes', p. 17.)  The tail of a\r\nshooting star (or its 'train'), on the subject of which Brandes has made so\r\nmany exact and delicate observations, is in no way to be ascribed to the\r\ncontinuance of the impression produced by light on the retina.  It sometimes\r\ncontinues visible a whole minute, and in some rare instances longer than the\r\nlight of the nucleus of the shooting star; in which case the luminous track\r\nremains motionless.  (Gilb., 'Ann.', bd. xiv., s. 251.)  This circumstance\r\nfurther indicates the analogy between large shooting stars and fire-balls.\r\nAdmiral Krusenstern saw, in his voyage round the world, the train of a\r\nfire-ball shine for an hour after the lluminous body itself had disappeared,\r\nand scarcely move throughout the whole time.  ('Reise', th. i., s. 58.)  Sir\r\nAlexander Burnes gives a charming description of the transparency of the\r\nclear atmosphere of Bokhara, which was once so favorable to the pursuit of\r\nastronomical observations.  Bokhara is situated in 39 degrees 48' north\r\nlatitude, and at an elevation of 1280 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\"There is a constant serenity in its atmosphere, and an admirable clearness\r\nin the sky.  At night, the stars have uncommon luster, and the Milky Way\r\nshines gloriously in the firmament.  There is also a never-ceasing display\r\nof the most brilliant meteors, which dart like rockets in the sky; ten or\r\ntwelve of them are sometimes seen in an hour, assuming every color -- fiery\r\nred, blue, pale, and faint.  It is a noble country for astronomical science,\r\nand great must have been the advantage enjoyed by the famed observatory of\r\nSamarkand.\"  (Burnes, 'Travels into Bokhara', vol. ii. (1834), p. 158.)  A\r\nmere traveler must not be reproached for calling ten or twelve shooting\r\nstars in an hour \"many,\" since it is only recently that we have learned,\r\nfrom careful observations on this subject in Europe, that eight is the mean\r\nnumber which may be seen in an hour in the field of vision of one individual\r\n(Quetelet, 'Corresp. Mathém.', Novem., 1837, p. 447); this number is,\r\nhowever, limited to five or six by that diligent observer, Olbers.  (Schum.,\r\n'Jahrb.', 1838, s. 325.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np 114\r\nSir Alexander Burnes likewise extols as a consequence of the purity of the\r\natmosphere in Bokhara the enchanting and constantly-recurring spectacle of\r\nvariously-colored shooting stars.\r\n\r\nThe connection of meteoric stones with the grander phenomenon of fire-balls\r\n-- the former being known to be projected from the latter with such force as\r\nto penetrate from ten to fifteen feet into the earth -- has been proved,\r\namong many other instances, in the falls of azzzuerolites at Barbotan, in\r\nthe Department des Landes (24th July, 1790), at Siena (16th June, 1794), at\r\nWeston, in Connecticut, U. S. (14th December, 1807), and at Juvenas in the\r\nDepartment of Ardèche (14th June, 1821).  Meteoric stones are in some\r\ninstances thrown from dark clouds suddenly formed in a clear sky, and fall\r\nwith a noise resembling thunder.  Whole districts have thus occasionally\r\nbeen covered with thousands of fragmentary masses, of uniform character but\r\nunequal magnitudes, that\r\np 115\r\nhave been hurled from one of these moving clouds.  In less frequent cases,\r\nas in that which occurred on the 16th of September, 1843, at Kleinwenden,\r\nnear Mühilhausen, a large aërolite fell with a thundering crash while the\r\nsky was clear and cloudless.  The intimate affinity between fire-balls and\r\nshooting stars is further proved by the fact that fire-balls, from which\r\nmeteoric stones have been thrown have occasionally been found, as at Angers,\r\non the 9th of June, 1822, having a diameter scarcely equal to that of the\r\nsmall fire-works called Roman candles.\r\n\r\nThe formative power, and the nature of the physical and chemical processes\r\ninvolved in these phenomena are questions all equally shrouded in mystery,\r\nand we are as yet ignorant whether the particles composing the dense mass of\r\nmeteoric stones are originally, as in comets, separated from one another\r\nwhen they become luminous to our sight, or whether in the case of smaller\r\nshooting stars, any compace substance actually falls, or, finally, whether a\r\nmeteor is composed only of a smoke-like dust, containing iron and nickel;\r\nwhile we are wholly ignorant of what takes place within the dark cloud from\r\nwhich a noise like thunder is often heard for many minutes before the stones\r\nfall.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On 'méteoric dust', see Arago, in the 'Annuaire' for 1832, p.\r\n254.  I haave very recently endeavored to show, in another work ('Asie\r\nCentrale', t. i., p. 408). how the Scythian saga of the sacred gold, which\r\nfell burning from heaven, and remained in the possession of the Golden Horde\r\nof the Paralatæ (Herod., iv., 5-7), probably originated in the vague\r\nrecollection of the fall of an aërolite.  The ancients had also some\r\nstrange fictions (Dio Cassius, lxxv., 1259) or silver which had fallen from\r\nheaven, and with which it had been attempted, under the Emperor Severus, to\r\ncover bronze coins; metallic iron was however, known to exist in meteoric\r\nstones.  (Plin., ii., 56.)  The frequently-recurring expression 'lapidibus\r\npluit' must not always be understood to refer to falls of aërolites.  In\r\nLiv., xxv., 7, it probably refers to pumice ('rapilli') ejected from the\r\nvolcano, Mount Albanus (Monte Cavo), which was not wholly extinguished at\r\nthe time.  (See Heyne, 'Opuscula Acad.', t. iii., p. 261; and my 'Relation\r\nHist.', t. i., p. 394.)  The contest of Hercules with the Ligyans, on the\r\nroad from the Caucasus to the Hesperides, belongs to a different sphere of\r\nideas, being an attempt to explain mythically the origin of the round quartz\r\nblocks in the Ligyan field of stones at the mouth of the Rhone, which\r\nAristotle supposes to have been ejected from a fissure during an earthquake,\r\nand Posidonius to have been caused by the force of the waves of an inland\r\npiece of water.  In the fragments that we still possess of the play of\r\nÆschylus, the 'Prometheus Delivered', every thing proceeds, however, in\r\npart of the narration, as in a fall of aërolites, for Jupiter draws\r\ntogether a cloud, and causes the \"district around to be covered by a shower\r\nof round stones\".  Posidonius even ventured to deride the geognostic myth of\r\nthe blocks and stones.  The Lygian field of stones was, however, very\r\nnaturally and well described by the ancients.  The district is now known as\r\n'La Crau.'  (See Guerin, 'Mesures Barométriques dans les Alpes, et\r\nMétéorologie d'Avignon', 1829, chap. xii., p. 115.)\r\n\r\n\r\np 116\r\nWe can ascertain by measurement the enormous, wonderful, and wholly\r\nplanetary velocity of shooting stars, fire-valls and meteoric stones, and we\r\ncan gain a knowledge of what is the general and uniform character of the\r\nphenomenon, but not of the genetically cosmical process and the results of\r\nthe metamorphoses.  If meteoric stones while revolving in space are already\r\nconsolidated into dense masses,* less dense, however,\r\np 117\r\nthan the mean density of the earth, they must be very small nuclei, which\r\nsurrounded by inflammable vapor or gas, form the innermost part of\r\nfire-balls, from the height and apparent diameter of which we may, in the\r\ncase of the largest, estimate that the actual diameter varies from 500 to\r\nabout 2800 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *The specific weight of aërolites varies from 1.9 (Alais) to 4.3\r\n(Tabor).  Their general density may be set down as 3, water being 1.  As to\r\nwhat has been said in the text of the actual diameters of fire-balls, we\r\nmust remark, that the numbers have been taken from the few measurements that\r\ncan be relied upon as correct.  These give for the fire-ball of Weston,\r\nConnecticut (14th December, 1807), only 500; for that observed by Le Roi\r\n(10th July, 1771) about 1000 and for that estimated by Sir Charles Blagden\r\n(18th January, 1783) 2600 feet in diameter.  Brandes ('Unterhaltungen'\r\nbd.i., s. 42) ascribes a diameter varying from 80 to 120 feet to shooting\r\nstars, and a luminous train extending from 12 to 16 miles.  There are,\r\nhowever, ample optical causes for supposing that the apparent diameter of\r\nfire-balls and shooting stars has been very much overrated.  The volume of\r\nthe largest fire-ball yet observed can not be compared with that of Ceres,\r\nestimating generally so exact and admirable treatise, 'On the Connection of\r\nthe Physical Sciences', 1835, p. 411.)  With the view of elucidating what\r\nhas been stated in the text regarding the large zërolite that fell into the\r\nbed of the River Narni, but has not again been found, I will give the\r\npassage made known by Pertz, from the 'Chronicon Benedicti, Monachi Sancti\r\nAndreæ in Mont Soracte', a MS. belonging to the tenth century, and\r\npreserved in the Chigi Library at Rome.  The Barbarous Latin of that age has\r\nbeen left unchanged.  \"Anno 921, temporibus domini Johannis Decimi pape, in\r\nanno pontificatus illius 7 visa sunt signa.

Graec', t. ii., p. 302, 320, 340; also Aristot., 'Meteor.',\r\ni., 7 (Ideler's 'Comm.', t. i., p. 404-407); Stob., 'Eel. Phys.', i., 25, p.\r\n508 (Heeren); Plut., 'Lys.', c. 12; Diog. Laert., ii., 10; and see, also,\r\nsubsequent notes in this work.  According to a Mongolisn tradition, a black\r\nfragment of a rock, forty feet in height, fell from heaven on a plain near\r\nthe source of the Great Yellow River in Western China.  (Abel Rémusat, in\r\nLamétherie, 'Jour. de Phys.', 1819, Mai p. 264.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest meteoric masses as yet known are those of Otumpa, in Chaco, and\r\nof Bahia, in Brazil, described by Rubi de Celis as being from 7 to 7 1/2\r\nfeet in length.  The meteoric stone of gos Potamos, celebrated in antiquity,\r\nand even mentioned in the Chronicle of the Parian Marbles, which fell about\r\nthe year in which Socrates was born, has been described as of the size of\r\ntwo mill-stones, and equal in weight to a full wagon load.  Notwithstanding\r\nthe failure that has attended the efforts of the African traveler, Brown, I\r\ndo not wholly relinquish the hope that, even after the lapse of 2312 years,\r\nthis Thracian meteoric mass, which it would be so difficult to destroy, may\r\nbe found, since the region in which it fell is now bcome so easy of access\r\nto European travelers.  The huge aërolite which in the beginning of the\r\ntenth century fell into the river at Narni, projected between three and four\r\nfeet above the surface of the water, as we learn from a document lately\r\ndiscovered by Pertz.  It must be remarked that these meteoric bodies,\r\nwhether in ancient or modern times can only be regarded as the principal\r\nfragments of masses that have been broken up by the explosion either of a\r\nfire-ball of a dark cloud.\r\n\r\nOn considering the enormous velocity with which, as has been mathematically\r\nproved, meteoric stones reach the earth from the extremest confines of the\r\natmosphere, and the lengthened course traversed by fire-balls through the\r\ndenser strata of the air, it seems more than improbable that these\r\nmetalliferous stony masses, containing perfectly-formed crystals of olivine,\r\nlabradorite, and pyroxene, should in so short a period of time has been\r\nconverted from a vaporous condition to a solid nucleus.  Moreover, that\r\nwhich falls from meteoric masses, even where the internal composition is\r\nchemically different, exhibits almost always the peculiar character of a\r\nfragment, being of a prismatic or truncated pyramidal form, with broad,\r\nsomewhat curved faces, and rounded angles.  But whence comes this form,\r\nwhich was first recognized by Schreiber as characteristic of the 'severed'\r\npart of a rotating planetary body?  Here, as in the sphere of organic life,\r\nall that appertains to the history of development remains hidden in\r\nobscurity.  Meteoric masses become luminous and kindle at heights which\r\np 118\r\nmust be regarded as almost devoid of air, of occupied by an atmosphere that\r\ndoes not even contain 1/100000th part of oxygen.  The recent investigations\r\nof Biot on the important phenomenon of twilight* have considerably lowered\r\nthe lines which had, perhaps with some degree of temerity, been usually\r\ntermed the boundaries of the atmosphere; but processes of light may be\r\nevolved independently of the presence of oxygen, and Poisson conjectured\r\nthat aëroliteswere ignited far beyond the range of our atmosphere.\r\nNumerical calculation and geometrical measurement are the only means by\r\nwhich as in the case of the larger bodies of our solar system, we are\r\nenabled to impart a firm and safe basis to our investigations of meteoric\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Biot, 'Traité d'Astronomie Physique' (3ème éd.), 1841, t.\r\ni., p. 149, 177, 238, 312.  My lamented friend Poisson endeavored, in a\r\nsingular manner, to solve the difficulty attending an assumption of the\r\nspontaneous ignition of meteoric stones at an elevation where the density of\r\nthe atmosphere is almost null.  These are his words:  \"It is difficult to\r\nattribute, as is uaually done, the incandescence of aërolites to friction\r\nagainst the molecules of the atmosphere at an elevation above the earth\r\nwhere the density of the air is almost null.  May we not suppose that the\r\nelectric fluid, in a neutral condition, forms a kind of atmosphere,\r\nextending far beyond the mass of our atmosphere, yet subject to terrestrial\r\nattraction, although physically imponderable, and consequently following our\r\nglobe in its motion?  According to this hypothesis, the bodies of which we\r\nhave been speaking would, on entering this imponderable atmosphere,\r\ndecompose the neutral fluid by their unequal action on the two\r\nelectricities, and they would thus be heated, and in a state of\r\nincandescence, by becoming electrified.\"  (Poisson, 'Rech. sur la\r\nProbabilité des Jugements', 1837, p. 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Halley pronounced the great fire-ball of 1686, whose motion was\r\nopposite to that of the earth in its orbit,* to be a cosmical body, Chadni,\r\nin 1794, first recognized, with ready acuteness of mind, the connection\r\nbetween fire-balls and the stones projected from the atmosphere, and the\r\nmotions of the former bodies in space.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *'Philos. Transact.', vol. xxix., p. 161-163.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] **The first edition of Chlandni's important treatise, 'Ueber den\r\nUrsprung der von Pallas gefundenen und anderen Eisenmassen' (On the Origin\r\nof the masses of Iron found by Pallas, and other similar masses), appeared\r\ntwo months prior to the shower of stones at Siena, and two years before\r\nLichtenberg stated, in the 'Güttingen Taschenbuch', that \"stones reach our\r\natmosphere from the remoter regions of space.'  Comp., also, Olbers's letter\r\nto Benzenberg, 18th Nov., 1837, in Benzenberg's 'Treatise on Shooting\r\nStars', p. 186.\r\n\r\n\r\nA brilliant confirmation of the cosmical origin of these phenomena has been\r\nafforded by Denison Olmsted, at New Haven, Connecticut, who has shown on the\r\nconcurrent authority of all eye-witnesses, that during the celebrated fall\r\nof shooting stars on the night between the 12th\r\np 119\r\nand 13th of November, 1833, the fire-balls and shooting stars all emerged\r\nfrom one and the same quarter of the heavens, namely, in the vicinity of the\r\nstar 'gamma' in the constellation Leo, and did not deviate from this point,\r\nalthough the star changed its apparent height and azimuth during the time of\r\nthe observation.  Such an independence of the Earth's rotation shows that\r\nthe luminous body must have reached our atmosphere from 'without.'\r\nAccording to Encke's computation* of the whole\r\np 120\r\nnumber of observations made in the United States of North America, between\r\nthe thirty-fifth and the forty-second degrees of latitude, it would appear\r\nthat all these meteors came from the same point of space in the direction in\r\nwhich the Earth was moving at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Encke, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxiii. (1834), s. 213.\r\nArago, in the 'Annuaire' for 1836, p. 291.  Two letters which I wrote to\r\nBenzenberg, May 19 and October 22, 1837, on the conjectural precession of\r\nthe nodes in the orbit of periodical falls of shooting stars.  (Benzenberg's\r\n'Sternsch.', s. 207 and 209.)  Olbers subsequently adopted this opinion of\r\nthe gradual retardation of the November phenomenon.  ('Astron. Nachr.',\r\n1838, No. 372, s. 180.)  If I may venture to combine two of the falls of\r\nshooting stars mentioned by the Arabian writers with the epochs found by\r\nBoguslawski for the fourteenth century, I obtain the following more or less\r\naccordant elements of the movements of the nodes:\r\n     In Oct., 902, on the night in which King Ibrahim ben Ahmed died, there\r\nfell a heavy shower of shooting stars, \"like a fiery rain;\" and this year\r\nwas, therefore, called the year of stars.  (Conde, 'Hist. de la Domin.' de\r\nlos Arabes', p. 346.)\r\n     On the 19th of Oct., 1202, the stars were in motion all night.  \"They\r\nfell like locusts.\"  ('Comptes Rendus', 1837, t. i., p. 294; and Fræhn, in\r\nthe 'Bull. de l'Académie de St. Pétersbourg', t. iii., p. 308.)\r\n     On the 21st Oct., O.S., 1366, \"'die sequente post festum XI. millia\r\nVirginum ab hora matutina usque ad horam primam visæ sunt quasi stellæ de\r\ncælo cadere continuo, et in tanta multitudine, quod nemo narrare suf\r\nficit.'\"  This remarkable notice, of which we shall speak more fully in the\r\nsubsequent part of this work, was found by the younger Von Boguslawski, in\r\nBenesse (de Horowic) de Weitmil or Weithmül, 'Chronicon Ecclesiæ\r\nPragensis', p. 389.  This chronicle may also be found in the second part of\r\n'Scriptores rerum Bohemicarum', by Pelzel and Dobrowsky, 1784.  (Schum.,\r\n'Astr. Nachr.', Dec., 1839.)\r\n     On the night between the 9th and 10th of November, 1787, many falling\r\nstars were observed at Manheim, Southern Germany, by Hemmer (Kämtz,\r\n'Meteor.', th. iii., s. 237.)\r\n     After midnight, on the 12th of November, 1799, occurred the\r\nextraordinary fall of stars at Cumana, which Bonpland and myself have\r\ndescribed, and which was observed over a great part of the earth.  ('Relat.\r\nHist.', t. i., p. 519-527.)\r\n     Between the 12th and 13th of November, 1822, shooting stars,\r\nintermingled with fire-balls, were seen in large numbers by Kloden, at\r\nPotsdam.  (Gilbert's 'Ann.', bd. lxxii., s. 291.)\r\n     On the 13th of November, 1831, at 4 o'clock in the morning, a great\r\nshower of falling stars was seen by Captain Bérard, on the Spanish coast,\r\nnear Carthagena del Levante.  ('Annuaire', 1836, p. 297.)\r\n     In the night between the 12th and 13th of November, 1833, occurred the\r\nphenomenon so admirably described by Professor Olmsted, in North America.\r\n     In the night of the 13-14th of November, 1834, a similar fall of\r\nshooting stars was seen in North America, although the numbers were not\r\nquite so considerable.  (Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxiv., s. 129.)\r\n     On the 13th of November, 1835, a barn was set on fire by the fall of a\r\nsporadic fire-ball, at Belley, in the Department de l'Ain.  ('Annuaire',\r\n1836, p. 296.)\r\n     In the year 1838, the stream showed itself most decidedly on the night\r\nof the 13-14th of November.  ('Astron. Nachr.', 1838, No. 372.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the recurrence of falls of shooting stars in North America, in the month\r\nof November of the years 1834 and 1837, and in the analogous falls observed\r\nat Bremen in 1838, a like general parallelism of the orbits, and the same\r\ndirection of the meteors from the constellation Leo, were again noticed.  It\r\nhas been supposed that a greater parallelism was observable in the direction\r\nof periodic falls of shooting stars than in those of sporadic occurrence;\r\nand it has further been remarked, that in the periodically-recurring falls\r\nin the month of August, as, for instance, in the year 1839, the meteors came\r\nprincipally from one point between Perseus and Taurus, toward the latter of\r\nwhich constellations in the Earth was then moving.  This peculiarity of the\r\nphenomenon, manifested in the retrograde direction of the orbits in November\r\nand August, should be thoroughly investigated by accurate observations, in\r\norder that it may either be fully confirmed or refuted.\r\n\r\nThe heights of shooting stars, that is to say, the heights of the points at\r\nwhich they begin and cease to be visible, vary exceedingly, fluctuating\r\nbetween 16 and 140 miles.  This important result, and the enormous velocity\r\nof these problematical asteroids, were first ascertained by Benzenberg and\r\nBrandes, by simultaneous observations and determinations of parallax at the\r\nextremities of a base line of 49,020 feet in length.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *I am well aware that, among the 62 shooting stars\r\nsimultaneously observed in Silesia, in 1823, at the suggestion of Professor\r\nBrandes some appeared to have an elevation of 183 to 240, or even 400 miles.\r\n (Brandes, 'Unterhaltungen für Freunde der Astronomie und Physik', heft i.,\r\ns. 48.  Instructive Narratives for the Lovers of Astronomy and Physics.)\r\nBut Olbers considered that all determinations for elevations beyond 120\r\nmiles must be doubtful, owing to the smallness of the parallax.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relative velocity of motion is from 18 to 36 miles in a second, and\r\nconsequently equal to planetary velocity.  This planetary velocity,* as well\r\nas the direction of the orbits\r\np 121\r\nof fire-balls and shooting stars, which has frequently been observed to be\r\nopposite to that of the Earth, may be considered as conclusive arguments\r\nagainst the hypothesis that aërolites derive their origin from the\r\nso-called active 'lunar volcanoes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The planetary velocity of translation, the movement in the\r\norbit, is in Mercury 26.4, in Venus 19.2, and in the Earth 16.4 miles in a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerical views regarding a greater or lesser volcanic force on a small\r\ncosmical body, not surrounded by any atmosphere, must, from their nature, be\r\nwholly arbitrary.  We may imagine the reaction of the interior of a planet\r\non its crust ten or even a hundred times greater than that of our present\r\nterrestrial volcanoes; the direction of masses projected from a satellite\r\nrevolving from west to east might appear retrogressive, owing to the Earth\r\nin its orbit subsequently reaching that point of space at which these bodies\r\nfall.  If we examine the whole sphere of relations which I have touched upon\r\nin this work, in order to escape the charge of having made unproved\r\nassertions, we shall find that the hypothesis of the selenic origin of\r\nmeteoric stones* depends upon a number of conditions\r\np 122\r\nwhose accidental coincidence could alone convert a possible into an actual\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Chladni states that an Italian physicist, Paolo Maria Terzago,\r\non the occasion of the fall of an aërolite at Milan in 1660, by which a\r\nFranciscan monk was killed, was the first who surmised that aërolites were\r\nof selenic origin.  He says, in a memoir entitled 'Musæum Septalianum,\r\nManfredi Septalæ, Patricii Mediolanensis, industrioso labore constructum'\r\n(Tortona, 1664, p. 44), \"Labant philosophorum mentes sub horum lapidum\r\nponderibus; ni dicire velimus, lunan terram alteram, sine mundum esse, ex\r\ncujus montibus divisa frustra in inferiorem nostrum hunc orben dela bantur.\"\r\n Without any previous knowledge of this conjecture, Olbers was led, in the\r\nyear 1795 (after the celebrated fall at Siena on the 16th of June, 1794),\r\ninto an investigation of the amount of the initial tangential force that\r\nwould be requisite to bring to the Earth masses projected from the Moon.\r\nThis ballistic problem occupied, during ten or twelve years, the attention\r\nof the geometricians Laplace, Biot, Brandes, and Poisson.  The opinion which\r\nwas then so prevalent, but which has since been abandoned, of the existence\r\nof active volcanoes in the Moon, where air and water are absent, led to a\r\nconfusion in the minds of the generality of persons between mathematical\r\npossibilities and physical probabilities.  Olbers, Brandes, and Chladni\r\nthought \"that the velocity of 16 to 32 miles, with which fire-balls and\r\nshooting stars entered our atmosphere,\" furnished a refutation to the view\r\nof their selenic origin.  According to Olbers, it would require to reach the\r\nEarth, setting aside the resistance of the air, an initial velocity of 8292\r\nfeet in the second; according to Laplace, 7862; to Biot, 8282; and to\r\nPoisson, 7595.  Laplace states that this velocity is only five or six times\r\nas great as that of a cannon ball; but Olbers has shown \"that, with such an\r\ninitial velocity as 7500 or 8000 feet in a second, meteoric stones would\r\narrive at the surface of our earth with a velocity of only 35,000 feet (or\r\n1.53 German geographical mile).  But the measured velocity of meteoric\r\nstones averages five such miles, or upward of 114,000 feet to a second; and,\r\nconsequently, the original velocity of projection from the Moon must be\r\nalmost 110,000 feet, and therefore fourteen times greater than Laplace\r\nasserted.\"  (Olbers, in Schum, 'Jahrb.', 1837, p. 52-58; and in Gehler,\r\n'Neues Physik.'  'Wörterbuche', bd. vi., abth.3, s. 2199-2136.)  If we\r\ncould assume volcanic forces to be still active on the Moon's surface, the\r\nabsence of atmospheric resistance would certainly give to their projectile\r\nforce an advantage over that of our terrestrial volcanoes; but even in\r\nrespect to the measure of the latter force (the projectile force of our own\r\nvolcanoes), we have no observations on which any reliance can be placed, and\r\nit has probably been exceedingly overrated.  Dr. Peters, who accurately\r\nobserved and measured the phenomena presented by Ætna, found that the\r\ngreatest velocity of any of the stones projected from the crater was only\r\n1250 feet to a second.  Observations on the Peak of Teneriffe, in 1798, gave\r\n3000 feet.  Although Laplace, at the end of his work ('Expos. du Syst. du\r\nMonde', ed. de 1824, p. 399), cautiously observes, regarding aërolites,\r\n\"that in all probability they come from the depths of space,\" yet we see\r\nfrom another passage (chap. vi., p. 233) 6that, being probably unacquainted\r\nwith the extraordinary planetary velocity of meteoric stones, he inclines to\r\nthe hypothesis of their lunar origin, always, however, assuming that the\r\nstones projjected from the Moon \"become satellites of our Earth, describing\r\naround it more or less eccentric orbits, and thus not reaching its\r\natmosphere until several or even many revolutions have been accomplished.\"\r\nAs an Italian at Tortona had the fancy that aërolites came from the Moon,\r\nso some of the Greek philosophers thought they came from the Sun.  This was\r\nthe opinion of Diogenes Laertius (ii., 9) regarding the origin of the mass\r\nthat fell at \"gos Potamos (see note, p. 116).  Pliny, whose labors in\r\nrecording the opinions and statements of preceding writers are astonishing,\r\nrepeats the theory, and derides it the more freely, because he, with earlier\r\nwriters (Diog. Laert., 3 and 5, p. 99, Hübner), accuses Anaxagoras of\r\nhaving predicted the fall of aërolites from the\r\nSun:  \"Celebrant Græci Anaxagoram Clazomenium Olympiadis septuagesimæ\r\noctavæ secundo anno prædixisse cælestium litterarum scientia quibus\r\ndiebus saxum casurum esse e sole, idque factum interdia in Thraciæ parte ad\r\ngos flumen.  Quod si quis prædictum credat, simul fateatur necesse est,\r\nmajoris miraculi divinitatem Anaxagoræ fuisse, solvique rerum naturæ\r\nintellectum, et confundi omnia, si aut ipse Sol lapis esse aut unquam\r\nlapidem in eo fuisse credatur; decidere tamen crebro non erit dubium.\"  The\r\nfall of a moderate-sized stone, which is preserved in the Gymnasium at\r\nAbydos, is also reported to have been foretold by Anaxagoras.  The fall of\r\naërolites in bright sunshine, and when the Moon's disk was invisible,\r\nprobably led to the idea of sun-stones.  Moreover, according to one of the\r\nphysical dogmas of Anaxagoras, which brought on him the persecution of the\r\ntheologians (even as they have attacked the geologists of our own times),\r\nthe Sun was regarded as \"a molten fiery mass\" ([Greed words]).  In\r\naccordance with these views of Anaxagoras, we find Euripides, in 'Phaëton',\r\nterming the Sun \"a golden mass;\" that is to say, a fire-colored,\r\nbrightly-shining matter, but not leading to the inference that aërolites\r\nare golden sun-stones.  (See note to page 115.)  Compare Valckenaer,\r\n'Diatribe in Eurip. perd. Dram. Reliquias', 1767, p. 30.  Diog. Laert., ii.,\r\n40.  Hence, among the Greek philosophers, we find four hypotheses regarding\r\nthe origin of falling stars:  a telluric origin from ascending exhalations;\r\nmasses of stone raised by hurricane (see Aristot., 'Meteor., lib. i., cap.\r\niv., 2-13, and cap. vii., 9); a solar origin; and, lastly, an origin in the\r\nregions of space, as heavenly bodies which had long remained invisible.\r\nRespecting this  last opinion, which is that of Diogenes of Apollonia, and\r\nentirely accords with that of the present day, see pages 124 and 125.  It is\r\nworthy of remark, that in Syria, as I have been assured by a learned\r\nOrientalist, now resident at Smyrna, Andrea de Nericat, who instructed me in\r\nPersian, there is a popular belief that aërolites chiefly fall on clear\r\nmoonlight nights.  The ancients, on the contrary, especially looked for\r\ntheir fall during lunar eclipses.  (See Pliny, xxxvii., 10, p. 164.\r\nSolinus, c. 37.  Salm., 'Exere.', p. 531; and the passages collected by\r\nUkert, in his 'Geogr. der Griechen und Römer', th. ii., 1, s. 131, note\r\n14.)  On the improbability that meteoric masses are formed from\r\nmetal-dissolving gases, which, according to Fusinieri, may exist in the\r\nhighest strata of our atmosphere, and previously diffused through an almost\r\nboundless space, may suddenly assume a solid condition, and on the\r\npenetration and misceability of gases, see my '\r\nRelat. Hist.', t. i., p. 525.\r\n\r\n\r\np 122\r\nThe view of the original existence of\r\np 123\r\nsmall planetary masses in space is simpler, and at the same time, more\r\nanalogous with those entertained concerning the formation of other portions\r\nof the solar system.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that a large number of these cosmical bodies traverse\r\nspace undestroyed by the vicinity of our atmosphere, and revolve round the\r\nSun without experiencing any alteration but a slight increase in the\r\neccentricity of their orbits, occasioned by the attraction of the Earth's\r\nmass.  We may, consequently, suppose the possibility of these bodied\r\nremaining invisible to us during many years and frequent revolutions.  The\r\nsupposed phenomenon of ascending shooting stars and fire-balls, which\r\nChladni has unsuccessfully endeavored to explain on the hypothesis of the\r\n'reflection' of strongly compressed air, appears at first sight as the\r\nconsequence of some unknown tngential force propelling bodies from the\r\nearth; but Bessel has shown by theoretical deductions, confirmed by Feldt's\r\ncarefully-conducted calculations, that, owing to the absence of any proofs\r\nof the simultaneous occurrence of the observed disappearances, the\r\nassumptiopn of an ascent of shooting stars was rendered wholly improbable,\r\nand inadmissible as a result of observation.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *Bessel, in Schum., 'Astr. Nachr.', 1839, No 389 und 381, s. 222\r\nund 346.  At the conclusion of the Memoir there is a comparison of the Sun's\r\nlongitudes with the epochs of the November phenomenon, from the period of\r\nthe first observations in Cumana in 1799,\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion advanced by Olbers that the explosion of shooting stars and\r\nignited fire-balls not moving in straight lines may impel meteors upward in\r\nthe manner of rockets, and influence the direction of their orbits, must be\r\nmade the subject of future researches.\r\n\r\nShooting stars fall either seprately and in inconsiderable numbers, that is,\r\nsporadically, or in swarms of many thousands.\r\np 124\r\nThe latter, which are compared by Arabian authors to swarms of locusts, are\r\nperiodic in their occurrence, and move in streams, generally in a parallel\r\ndirection.  Among periodic falls, the most celebrated are that known as the\r\nNovember phenomenon, occurring from about the 12th to the 14th of November,\r\nand that of the festival of St. Lawrence (the 10th of August), whose \"fiery\r\ntears\" were noticed in former times in a church calendar of England, no less\r\nthan in old traditionary legends, as a meteorological event of constant\r\nrecurrence.*\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dr. Thomas Forster ('The Pocket Encyclopedia of Natural\r\nPhenomena' 1827, p. 17) states that a manuscript is preserved in the library\r\nof Christ's College, Cambridge,** written in the tenth century by a monk,\r\nand entitled 'Ephemerides Rerum Naturalium', in which the natural phenomena\r\nfor each day of the year are inscribed as, for instance, the first flowering\r\nof plants, the arrival of birds, etc.; the 10th of August is distinguished\r\nby the word \"meteorodes.\"  It was this indication, and the tradition of the\r\nfiery tears of St. Lawrence, that chiefly induced Dr. Forster to undertake\r\nhis extremely zealous investigation of the August phenomena.  (Quetelet,\r\n'Correspond. Mathém.', Série III., t. i., 1837, p. 433.)\r\n\r\n[further footnote]  **[No such manuscript is at present known to exist in\r\nthe library of that college.  For this information I am indebted to the\r\ninquiries of Mr. Cory, of Pembroke College, the learned editor of\r\n'Hieroglyphics of Horapollo Nilous', Greek and English, 1840.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great quantity of shooting stars and fire-balls of the\r\nmost various dimensions, which, according to Klöden, were seen to fall at\r\nPotsdam on the night between the 12th and 13th of November, 1822, and on the\r\nsame night of the year in 1832 throughout the whole of Europe, from\r\nPortsmouth to Orenburg on the Ural River, and even in the southern\r\nhemisphere, as in the Isle of France, no attention was directed to the\r\n'periodicity' of the phenomenon, and no idea seems to have been entertained\r\nof the connection existing between the fall of shooting stars and the\r\nrecurrence of certain days, until the prodigious swarm of shooting stars\r\nwhich occurred in North America between the 12th and 13th of November, 1833,\r\nand was observed by Olmsted and Palmer.  The stars fell on this occasion,\r\nlike flakes of snow, and it was calculated that at least 240,000 had fallen\r\nduring a period of nine hours.  Palmer, of New Haven, Connecticut, was led,\r\nin consequence of this splendid phenomenon, to the recollection of the fall\r\nof meteoric stones in 1799, first described by Ellicot and myself,* and\r\nwhich, by\r\np 125\r\na comparison of the facts I had adduced, showed that the phenomenon had been\r\nsimultaneously seen in the New Continent, from the equator to New Herrnhut\r\nin Greenland (65 degrees 14' north latitude), and between 46 degrees and 82\r\ndegrees longitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humb., 'Rel. Hist.', t. i., p. 519-527.  Ellicot in the\r\n'Transactions of the American Society', 1804, vol. vi., . 29.  Arago makes\r\nthe following observations in reference to the November phenomena:  \"We thus\r\nbecome more and more confirmed in the belief that there exists a zone\r\ncomposed of millions of small bodies, whose orbits cut the plane of the\r\necliptic at about the point which out Earth annually occupies between the\r\n11th and 13th of November.  It is a new planetary world beginning to be\r\nrevealed to us.\"  ('Annuaire', 1836, p. 296.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe identity of the epochs was recognized with astonishment.  The stream\r\nwhich had been seen from Jamaica to Boston (40 degrees 21' north latitude)\r\nto traverse the whole vault of heaven on the 12th and 13th of November,\r\n1833, was again observed in the United States in 1834, on the night between\r\nthe 13th and 14th of November, although on this latter occasion it showed\r\nitself with somewhat less intensity.  In Europe the periodicity of the\r\nphenomenon has since been manifested with great regularity.\r\n\r\nAnother and a like regularly recurring phenomenon is that noticed in the\r\nmonth of August, the meteoric stream of St. Lawrence, appearing between the\r\n9th and 14th of August.  Muschenbrock,* as early as in the middle of the\r\nlast century, drew attention to the frequency of meteors in the month of\r\nAugust' but their certain periodic return about the time of St. Lawrence's\r\nday was first shown by Quetelet, Olbers, and Benzenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Compare Muschenbroek, 'Introd. ad Phil. Nat.', 1762, t. ii., p.\r\n1061; Howard, 'On the Climate of London', vol. ii., p. 23, observations of\r\nthe year 1806; seven years, therefore aftr the earliest observations of\r\nBrandes (Benzenberg, 'über Sternschnuppen', s. 240-244); the August\r\nobservations of Thomas Forster, in Quetelet, op. cit., p. 438-453; those of\r\nAdolph Erman, Boguslawski, and Kreil, in Schum., 'Jahrb.', 1838, s. 317-330.\r\n Regarding the point of origin in Perseus, on the 10th of August, 1839, see\r\nthe accurate measurements of Bessel and Erman (Schum., 'Astr. Nachr.', No.\r\n385 und 428); but on the 10th of August, 1837, the path does not apper to\r\nhave been retrograde; see Arago in 'Comptes Rendus', 1837, t. ii., p. 183.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall, no doubt, in time, discover other periodically appearing streams,*\r\nprobably about the 22d to the\r\np. 126\r\n25th of April, between the 6th and 12th of December, and, to judge by the\r\nnumber of true falls of aërolites enumerated by Capocci, also between the\r\n27th and 29th of November, of about the 17th of July.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the 25th of April, 1095, \"innumerable eyes in France saw\r\nstars falling from heaven as thickly as hail\" ('ut grando, nisi lucerent,\r\npro densitate putaretur'; Baldr., p. 88), and this occurrence was regarded\r\nby the Council of Clermont as indicative of the great movement in\r\nChristendom.  (Wilken, 'Gesch. der Kreuzzüge', bd. i., s. 75.)  On the 25th\r\nof April, 1800, a great fall of stars was observed in Virginia and\r\nMassachusetts; it was \"a fire of rockets that lasted two hours.\"  Arago was\r\nthe first to call attention to the \"trainée d'asteroïdes,\" as a recurring\r\nphenomenon.  ('Annuaire', 1836, p. 297.)  The falls of aërolites in the\r\nbeginning of the month of December are also deserving of notice.  In\r\nreference to their periodic recurrence as a meteoric stream, we may mention\r\nthe early observation of Brandes on the night of the 6th and 7th of\r\nDecember, 1798 (when he counted 2000 falling stars), and very probably the\r\nenormous fall of aërolites that occurred at the Rio Assu, near the village\r\nof Macao, in the Brazils, on the 11th of December, 1836.  (Brandes,\r\n'Unterhalt. für Freunde der Physik', 1825, heft i., s. 65, and 'Comptes\r\nRendus', t. v., p. 211.)  Capocci, in the interval between 1809 and 1839, a\r\nspace of thirty years, has discovered twelve authenticated cases of\r\naërolites occurring between the 27th and 29th of November, besides others\r\non the 13th of November, the 10th of August, and the 17th of July.\r\n('Comptes Rendus', t. xi., p. 357.)  It is singular that in the portion of\r\nthe Earth's path corresponding with the months of January and February, and\r\nprobably also with March, no 'periodic' streams of falling stars of\r\naërolites have as yet been noticed; although when in the South Sea in the\r\nyear 1803, I observed on the 15th of March a remarkably large number of\r\nfalling stars, and they were seen to fall as in a swarm in the city of\r\nQuito, shortly before the terrible earthquake of Riobamba on the 4th of\r\nFebruary, 1797.  From the phenomena hitherto observed, the following epochs\r\nseem especially worthy of remark:\r\n22d to the 25th of April.\r\n17th of July (17th to the 26th of July?).  (Quet., 'Corr.', 1837, p. 435.)\r\n10th of August.\r\n12th to the 14th of November.\r\n27th to the 29th of November.\r\n6th to the 12th of December.\r\nWhen we consider that the regions of space must be occupied by myriads of\r\ncomets, we are led by analogy, notwithstanding the differences existing\r\nbetween isolated comets and rings filled with asteroids, to regard the\r\nfrequency of these meteoric streams with less astonishment than the first\r\nconsideration of the phenomenon would be likely to excite.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the phenomena hitherto observed appear to have been independent of\r\nthe distance from the pole, the temperature of the air, and other climatic\r\nrelations, there is, however, one perhaps accidentally coincident phenomenon\r\nwhich must not be wholly disregarded.  The Northern Light, the Aurora\r\nBorealis, was unusually brilliant on the occurrence of the Borealis, was\r\nunusually brilliant on the occurrence of the splendid fall of meteors of the\r\n12th and 13th November, 1833, described by Olmsted.  It was also observed at\r\nBremen in 1838, where the periodic meteoric fall was, however, less\r\nremarkable than at Richmond, near London.  I have mentioned in another work\r\nthe singular fact observed by Admiral Wrangel, and frequently confirmed to\r\nme by himself,* that when he\r\np 127\r\nwas on the Siberian coast of the Polar Sea, he observed, during an Aurora\r\nBorealis, certain portions of the vault of heaven which were not\r\nilluminated, light up and continue luminous whenever a shooting star passed\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Ferd. v. Wrangle, 'Reise längs der Nordküste von Sibirien in\r\nden Jahren', 1820-1824, th. ii., s. 259.  Regarding the recurrence of the\r\ndenser swarm of the November stream after an interval of thirty-three years,\r\nsee Olbers, in 'Jahrb.', 1837, s. 280.  I was informed in Cumana that\r\nshortly before the fearful earthquake of 1766, and consequently thirty-three\r\nyears (the same interval) before the great fall of stars on the 11th and\r\n12th of November, 1799, a similar fiery manifestation had been observed in\r\nthe heavens.  But it was on the 21st of October, 1766, and not in the\r\nbeginning of November, that the earthquake occurred.  Possibly some traveler\r\nin Quito may yet be able to ascertain the day on which the volcano of\r\nCayambe, which is situated there, was for the space of an hour enveloped in\r\nfalling stars, so that the inhabitants endeavored to appease heaven by\r\nreligious processions.  ('Relat. Hist.', t. i., chap. iv., p 307; chap. x.,\r\np. 520 and 527.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different meteoric streams, each of which is composed of myriads of\r\nsmall cosmical bodies, probably intersect our Earth's orbit in the same\r\nmanner as Biela's comet.  According to this hypothesis, we may represent to\r\nourselves these asteroid-meteors as composing a closed ring or zone, within\r\nwhich they all pursue one common orbit.  The s aller planets between Mars\r\nand Jupiter present us if we except Pallas with an analogous relation in\r\ntheir constantly intersecting orbits.  As yet, however, we have no certain\r\nknowledge as to whether changes in the periods at which the stream becomes\r\nvisible, or the 'retardations' of the phenomena of which I have already\r\nspoken, indicate a regular precession of oscillation of the nodes -- that is\r\nto say, of the points of intersection of the Earth's orbit and of that of\r\nthe ring; or whether this ring or zone attains so considerable a degree of\r\nbreadth from the irregular grouping and distances apart of the small bodies,\r\nthat it requires several days for the Earth to traverse it.  The system of\r\nSaturn's satellites shows us likewise a group of immense width, composed of\r\nmost intimately-connected cosmical bodies.  In this system, the orbit of the\r\noutermost (the seventh) satellite has such a vast diameter, that the Earth,\r\nin her revolution round the Sun, requires three days to traverse an extent\r\nof space equal to this diameter.  If, therefore, in one of these rings,\r\nwhich we regard as the orbit of a periodical stream, the asteroids should be\r\nso irregularly distributed as to consist of but few groups sufficiently\r\ndense to give rise to these phenomena, we may easily understand why we so\r\nseldom witness such glorious spectacles as those exhibited in the November\r\nmonths of 1799 and 1833.  The acute mind of Olbers led him almost to predict\r\nthat the next appearance of the phenomenon of shooting stars and fire-balls\r\nintermixed, falling like flakes of snow, would not recur until between the\r\n12th and 14th of November, 1867.\r\n\r\np 128\r\nThe stream of the November asteroids has occasionally only been visible in a\r\nsmall section of the Earth.  Thus, for instance, a very splendid 'meteoric\r\nshower' was seen in England in the year 1837, while a most attentive and\r\nskillful observer at Braunsberg, in Prussia only saw on the same night,\r\nwhich was there uninterruptedly clear, a few sporadic shooting stars fall\r\nbetween seven o'clock in the evening and sunrise the next morning.  Bessel*\r\nconcluded from this \"that a dense group of the bodies composing the great\r\nring may have reached that part of the Earth in which England is situated,\r\nwhile the more eastern districts of the Earth might be passing at the time\r\nthrough a part of the meteoric ring proportionally less densely studded with\r\nbodies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *From a letter to myself, dated Jan. 24th, 1838.  The enormous\r\nswarm of falling stars in November, 1799, was almost exclusively seen in\r\nAmerica, where it was witnessed from New Herrnhut in Greenland to the\r\nequator.  The swarms of 1831 and 1832 were visible only in Europe, and those\r\nof 1833 and 1834 only in the United States of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the hypothesis of a regular progression or oscillation of the nodes\r\nshould acquire greater weight, special interest will be attached to the\r\ninvestigation of older observations.  The Chinese annals, in which great\r\nfalls of shooting stars, as well as the phenomena of comets, are recorded,\r\ngo back beyond the age of Tyrtæs, or the second Messenian war.  They give a\r\ndescription of two streams in the month of March, one of which is 687 years\r\nanterior to the Christian era.  Edward Biot has observed that among the\r\nfifty-two phenomena which he has collected from the Chinese annals, those\r\nthat were of most frequent recurrence are recorded at periods nearly\r\ncorresponding with the 20th and 22d of July, O.S., and might consequently be\r\nidentical with the stream of St. Lawrence's day, taking into account that it\r\nhas advanced since the epochs* indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Lettre de M.

On the notice from the 'Chronicon\r\nEcclesiæ Pragensis', see the younger Boguslawski, in Poggend., 'Annalen',\r\nbd. xlviii., s. 612.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the fall of shooting stars of the 21st of October, 1366, O.S. (a notice\r\nof which was found by the younger Von Boguslawski, in Benessius de Horowic's\r\n'Chronicon Ecclesiæ Pragensis'), be identical with our November phenomenon,\r\nalthough the occurrence in the fourteenth century was seen in broad\r\ndaylight, we find by the precession in 477 years that this system of\r\nmeteors, or, rather, its common center of gravity, must describe\r\np 129\r\na retrograde orbit round the Sun.  It also follows, from the views thus\r\ndeveloped, that the non-appearance, during certain years, in any portion of\r\nthe Earth, of the two streams hitherto observed in November and about the\r\ntime of St. Lawrence's day, must be ascribed either to an interruption in\r\nthe meteoric ring, that is to say, to intervals occurring between the\r\nasteroid groups, or, according to Poisson to the action of the larger\r\nplanets* on the form and position of this annulus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"It appears that an apparently inexhaustible number of bodies,\r\ntoo small to be observed, are moving in the regions of space, either around\r\nthe Sun or the planets, or perhaps even around their satellites.  It is\r\nsupposed that when these bodies come in contact with our atmosphere, the\r\ndifference between their velocity and that of our planet is so great, that\r\nthe friction which they experience from their contact with the air heats\r\nthem to incandescence, and sometimes causes their explosion.  If the group\r\nof falling stars form an annulus around the Sun, its velocity of circulation\r\nmay be very different from that of our Earth; and the displacements it may\r\nexperience in space, in consequence of the actions of the various planets,\r\nmay render the phenomenon of its intersecting the planes of the ecliptic\r\npossible at some epochs, and altogether impossible at others.\" -- Poisson,\r\n'Recherches sur la Probabilité des Jugements', p. 306, 307.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solid masses which are observed by night to fall to the earth from\r\nfire-balls, and by day generally when the sky is clear, from a cark small\r\ncloud, are accompanied by much candescence.  They undeniably exhibit a great\r\ndegree of general identity with respect to their external form, the\r\ncharacter of their crust, and the chemical composition of their principal\r\nconstituents.  These characteristics of identity have been observed at all\r\nthe different epochs and in the most various parts of the earth in which\r\nthese meteoric stones have been found.  This striking and early-observed\r\nanalogy of physiognomy in the denser meteoric masses is, however, met by\r\nmany exceptions regarding individual points.  What differences, for\r\ninstance, do we not find between the malleable masses of for instance, do we\r\nnot find between the malleable masses of iron of Hradeschina in the district\r\nof Agram, those from the shores of the Sisim in the government of Jeniseisk,\r\nrendered so celebrated by Pallas, or those which I brought from Mexico,* all\r\nof which contain 96 per cent. of iron, from the aërolites of Siena, in\r\nwhich the iron scarcely amounts to 2 per cent., or the earthy aërolite of\r\nAlais (in the Department du Gard), which broke up in water, or, lastly, from\r\nthose of Jonzac and Javenas, which contained no metallic iron, but presented\r\na\r\np 130\r\nmixture of oryctognostically distinct crystalline compoonents!\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Essai Politique sur la Nouv. Espagne' (2de édit.),\r\nt. iii. p. 310.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese differences have led mineralogists to separate these cosmical masses\r\ninto two classes, namely, those containing nickelliferous meteoric iron, and\r\nthose consisting of fine or coarsely-granular meteoric dust.  The crust or\r\nrind of aërolites is peculiarly characteristic of these bodies, being only\r\na few tenths of a line in thickness, often glossy and pitch-like, and\r\noccasionally veined.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The peculiar color of their crust was observed even as early as\r\nin the time of Pliny (ii., 56 and 58):  \"colore adusto.\"  The phrase\r\n\"lateribus pluisse\" seems also to refer to the burned outer surface of\r\naërolites.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is only one instance on record, as far as I am aware (the aërolite of\r\nChantonnay, in La Vendée), in which the rind was absent, and this meteor,\r\nlike that of Juvenas, presented likewise the peculiarity of having pores and\r\nvesicular cavities.  In all other cases the black crust is divided from the\r\ninner light-gray mass by as sharply-defined a line of separation as is the\r\nblack leaden-colored investment of the white granit blocks* which I brought\r\nfrom the cataracts of the Orinoco, and which are also associated with many\r\nother cataracts, as, for instance, those of the Nile and of the Congo River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Humb., 'Rel. Hist.', t. ii., chap xx., p. 299-302.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest heat employed in our porcelain ovens would be insufficient to\r\nproduce any thing similar to the crust of meteoric stones, whose interior\r\nremains wholly unchanged.  Here and there, facts have been observed which\r\nwould seem to indicate a fusion together of the meteoric fragments; but, in\r\ngeneral, the character of the aggregate mass, the absence of compression by\r\nthe fall, and the inconsiderable degree of heat possessed by these bodies\r\nwhen they reach the earth, are all opposed to the hypothesis of the interior\r\nbeing in a state of fusion during their short passage from the boundary of\r\nthe atmosphere to our Earth.\r\n\r\nThe chemical elements of which these meteoric masses consist, and on which\r\nBerzelius has thrown so much light, are the same as those distributed\r\nthroughout the earth's crust, and are fifteen in number, namely, iron,\r\nnickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium, copper, arsenic, zinc, potash, soda,\r\nsulphur, phosphorus, and carbon, constituting altogether nearly one third of\r\nall the known simple bodies.  Notwithstanding this similarity with the\r\nprimary elements into which inorganic bodies are chemically reducible, the\r\naspect of aërolites, owing to the mode in which their constituent parts are\r\ncompounded, presents, generally, some features foreign to our telluric rocks\r\nand minerals.  The pure native iron, which is almost always\r\np 131\r\nfound incorporated with aërolites, imparts to them a peculiar, but not\r\nconsequently, a 'selenic' character; for in other regions of space, and in\r\nother cosmical bodies besides our Moon, water may be wholly absent, and\r\nprocesses of oxydation of rare occurence.\r\n\r\nCosmical gelatinous vesicles, similar to the organic 'nostoc' (masses which\r\nhave been supposed since the Middle Ages to be connected with shooting\r\nstars), and those pyrites of Sterlitamak, west of the Uralian Mountains,\r\nwhich are said to have constituted the interior of hailstones,* must both be\r\nclassed among the mythical fables of meteorology.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Gustav Rose, 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. II., s. 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome few aërolites, as those composed of a finely granular tissue of\r\nolivine, augite, and labradorite blended together* (as the meteoric stone\r\nfound at Juvenas, in the Department de l'Ardèche, which resembled\r\ndolorite), are the only ones, as Gustav Rose has remarked, which have a more\r\nfamiliar aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *Gustav Rose, in Poggend., 'Ann.', 1825, bd. iv., x. 173-192.\r\nRammelsberg, 'Erstes Suppl. zum chem. Handwörterbuche der Mineralogie',\r\n1843, s. 102.  \"It is,\" says the clear-minded observer Olbers, \"a remarkable\r\nbut hitherto unregarded fact, that while shells are found in secondary and\r\ntertiary formations, no 'fossil meteoric stones' have as yet been\r\ndiscovered.  May we conclude from this circumstance that previous to the\r\npresent and last modification of the earth's surface no meteoric stones fell\r\non it, although at the present time it appears probable, from the researches\r\nof Schreibers, that 700 fall annually?\"  (Olbers, in Schum., 'Jahrb.', 1838,\r\ns. 329.)  Problematical nickelliferous masses of native iron have been found\r\nin Northern Asia (at the gold-washing establishment at Petropawlowsk, eighty\r\nmiles southeast of Kusnezk), imbedded thirty-one feet in the ground, and\r\nmore recently in the Western Carpathians (the mountain chain of Magura, at\r\nSzlanicz), both of which are remarkably like meteoric stones.  Compart\r\nErman, 'Archiv für wissenschaftliche Kunde von Russland', bd. i., s. 315,\r\nand Haidinger, 'Bericht über Szlaniczer Schürfe in Ungarn.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThese bodiescontain, for instance, crystalline substances, perfectly similar\r\nto those of our earth's crust; and in the Siberian mass of meteoric iron\r\ninvestigated by Pallas, the olivine only differs from common olivine by the\r\nabsence of nickel, which is replaced by the oxyd of tin.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Berzelius, 'Jahresber.', bd. xv., s. 217 und 231.  Rammelsberg,\r\n'Handwörterb., abth. ii., s. 25-28.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs meteoric olivine, like our basalt, contains from 47 to 49 per cent. of\r\nmagnesia, constituting, according to Berzelius, almost the half of the\r\nearthy components of meteoric stones, we can not be surprised at the great\r\nquantity of silicate of magnesia found in these cosmical bodies.  If the\r\nzërolite of Juvenas contain separable crystals of augite and labradorite,\r\nthe numerical relation of the constituents\r\np 132\r\nrender it at least probable that the meteoric masses of Chateau-Renard may\r\nbe a compound of diorite, consisting of hornblende and albite, and those of\r\nBlansko and Chantonnay compounds of hornblende and labradorite.  The proofs\r\nof the telluric and atmospheric origin of aUerolites, which it is attempted\r\nto base upon the oryctognostic analogies presented by these bodies, do not\r\nappear to me to possess any great weight.\r\n\r\nRecalling to mind the remarkable interview between Newton and Conduit at\r\nKensington,* I would ask why the elementary substances that compose one\r\ngroup of cosmical bodies, or one planetary system, may not, in a great\r\nmeasure, be identical?\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * \"Sir Isaac Newton said he took all the planets to be composed\r\nof the same matter with the Earth, viz., earth, water, and stone, but\r\nvariously connected.\" -- Turner, 'Collections for the History of Grantham,\r\ncontaining authentic Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton', p. 172.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should we not adopt this view, since we may conjecture that these\r\nplanetary bodies, like all the larger or smaller agglomerated masses\r\nrevolving round the sun, have been thrown off from the once far more\r\nexpanded solar atmosphere, and been formed from vaporous rintgs describing\r\ntheir orbits round the central body?  We are not, it appears to me, more\r\njustified in applying the term telluric to the nickel and iron, the olivine\r\nand pyroxene (augite), found in meteoric stones, than in indicating the\r\nGerman plants which I found beyond the Obi as European species of the flora\r\nof Northern Asia.  If the elementary substances composing a group of\r\ncosmical bodies of different magnitudes be identical, why should they not\r\nlikewise, in obeying the laws of mutual attraction, blend together under\r\ndefinite relations of mixture, composing the white glittring snow and ice in\r\nthe polar zones of the planet Mars, or constituting in the smaller cosmical\r\nmasses mineral bodies inclosing crystals of olivine, augite, and\r\nlabradorite?  Even in the domain of pure conjecture we should not suffer\r\nourselves to be led away by unphilosophical and arbitrary views devoid of\r\nthe support of inductive reasoning.\r\n\r\nRemarkable obscurations of the sun's disk, during which the stars have been\r\nseen at mid-day (as, for instance, in the obscuration of 1547, which\r\ncontinued for three days, and occurred about the time of the eventful battle\r\nof Mühlberg), can not be explained as arising from volcanic ashes or mists,\r\nand were regarded by Kepler as owing either to a 'materia cometica', or to a\r\nblack cloud formed by the sooty exhalations of the solar body.  The shorter\r\nobscurations of 1090 and 1203, which continued, the one only three, and the\r\nother six\r\np 133\r\nhours, were supposed by Chladni and Schnurrer to be occasioned by the\r\npassage of meteoric masses before the sun's disk.  Since the period that\r\nstreams of meteoric shooting stars were first considered with reference to\r\nthe direction of their orbit as a closed ring, the epochs of these\r\nmysterious celestial phenomena have been observed to present a remarkable\r\nconnection with the regular recurrence of swarms of shooting stars Adolph\r\nErman has evinced great acuteness of mind in his accurate investigation of\r\nthe facts hitherto observed on this subject, and his researches have enabled\r\nhim to discover the connection of the sun's conjunction with the August\r\nasteroids on the 7th of February, and with the November asteroids on the\r\n12th of May, the latter period corresponding with the days of\r\nSt. Mamert (May 11th), St. Pancras (May 12th), and St. Servatius (May 13th),\r\nwhich according to popular belief, were accounted \"cold days.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  Adolph Erman, in Poggend., 'Annalen', 1839, bd. xlviii., s.\r\n582-601.  Biot had previously thrown doubt regarding the probability of the\r\nNovember stream reappearing in the beginning of May ('Comptes Rendus', 1836,\r\nt. ii., p. 670).  Mädler has examined the mean depression of temperature on\r\nthe three ill-named days of May by Berlin observations for eighty-six years\r\n('Verhandl. des Vereins zur Bedförd, des Gartenbaues', 1834, s. 377), and\r\nfound a retrogression of temperature amounting to 2.2 degrees Fahr. from the\r\n11th to the 13th of May, a period at which nearly the most rapid advance of\r\nheat takes place.  It is much to be desired that this phenomenon of\r\ndepressed temperature, which some have felt inclined to attribute to the\r\nmelting of the ice in the northeast of Europe, should be also investigated\r\nin very remote spots, as in America, or in the southern hemisphere.  (Comp.\r\n'Bull. de l'Acad. Imp. de St. Pétersbourg', 1843, t. i., No. 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greek natural philosophers, who were but little disposed to pursue\r\nobservations, but evinced inexhaustible fergility of imagination in giving\r\nthe most various interpretation of half-perceived facts, have, however, left\r\nsome hypotheses regarding shooting stars and meteoric stones which\r\nstrikingly accord with the views now almost universally admitted of the\r\ncosmical process of these phenomena.  \"Falling stars,\" says Plutarch, in his\r\nlife of Lysander,* are, according to the opinion of some physicists, not\r\neruptions of the ethereal fire extinguished in the air immediately after its\r\nignition, nor yet an inflammatory combustion of the air, which is dissolved\r\nin large quantities in the upper regions of space, but these meteors are\r\nrather a fall of celestial bodies, which, in consequence of a certain\r\nintermission in the rotatory force, and by the impulse of some irregular\r\nmovements, have been hurled down not only to the inhabited portions of the\r\nEarth, but also beyond it into the great ocean, where we can not find them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Plut., 'Vitæ par, in Lysandro', cap. 22.  The statement of\r\nDamachos (Daïmachos), that for seventy days continuously there was a fiery\r\ncloud seen in the sky, emitting sparks like falling stars, and which then,\r\nsinking nearer to the earth, let fall the stone of Ægos Potamos, \"which,\r\nhowever, was only a small part of it,\" is extremely improbable, since the\r\ndirection and velocity of the fire-cloud would in that case of necessity\r\nhave to remain for so many days the same as those of the earth; and this, in\r\nthe fire-ball of the 19th of July, 1686, described by Halley ('Trans.', vol.\r\nxxix., p. 163), lasted only a few minutes.  It is not altogether certain\r\nwhether Daïmachos, the writer, [Greek words], was the same person as\r\nDaïmachos of Platæa, who was sent by Selencus to India to the son of\r\nAndrocottos, and who ws charged by Strabo with being \"a speaker of lies\" (p.\r\n70, Casaub.).  From another passage of Plutarch ('Compar. Solonis c. Cop.',\r\ncap. 5) we should almost believe that he was.  At all events, we have here\r\nonly the evidence of a very late author, who wrote a century and a half\r\nafter the fall of aërolites occurred in Thrace, and whose authenticity is\r\nalso doubted by Plutarch.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiogenes of Apollonia* expresses himself still more explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Stob., ed. Heeren, i., 25, p. 508; Plut., 'de plac. Philos.',\r\nii., 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to his views, \"Stars that are 'invisible', and, consequently, have\r\nno name, move in space together with those that are visible.  These\r\ninvisible stars frequently fall burning at Ægos Potamos.\"  The Apollonian,\r\nwho held all other stellar bodies, when luminous, to be of a pumice-like\r\nnature, probably grounded his opinions regarding shooting stars and meteoric\r\nmasses on the doctrine of Anaxagoras the Clazomenian, who regarded all the\r\nbodies in the universe \"as fragments of rocks, which the fiery ether, in the\r\nforce of its gyratory motion, had torn from the Earth and converted into\r\nstars.\"  In the Ionian school, therefore, according to the testimony\r\ntransmitted to us in the views of Diogenes of Apollonia, aërolites and\r\nstars were ranged in one and the same class; both, when considered with\r\nreference to their primary origin, being equally telluric, this being\r\nunderstood only so far as the Earth was then regarded as a central body,*\r\np 135\r\nforming all things around it in the same manner was we, according to our\r\npresent views, suppose the planets of our system to have originated in the\r\nexpanded atmosphere of another central body, the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The remarkable passage in Plut., 'de plac. Philos.', ii., 13,\r\nruns thus:  \"Anaxagoras teaches that the surrounding ether is a fiety\r\nsubstance, which, by the power of its rotation, tears rocks from the earth,\r\ninflames them, and converts them into stars.\"  Applying an ancient fable to\r\nillustrate a physical dogma, the Clazomenian appears to have ascribed the\r\nfall of the Nemæan Lion to the Peloponnesus from the Moon to such a\r\nrotatory or centrifugal force.  (Ælian., xii., 7; Plut., 'de Facie in Orge\r\nLunæ' c. 24; Schol. ex Cod. Paris., in 'Apoll. Argon.', lib. i., p. 498,\r\ned. Schaef., t. ii., p. 40; Meineke, 'Annal. Alex.', 1843, p. 85.)  Here,\r\ninstead of stones from the Moon, we have an animal from the Moon!  According\r\nto an acute remark of Böckh, the ancient mythology of the Nemæan lunar\r\nlion has an astronomical origin, and is symbolically connected in chronology\r\nwith the cycle of intercalation of the lunar year, with the moon-worship at\r\nNemæa, and the games by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese views must not, therefore, be confounded with what is commonly termed\r\nthe telluric or atmospheric origin of meteoric stones, nor yet with the\r\nsingular opinion of Aristotle, which supposed the enormous mass of Ægos\r\nPotamos to have been raised by a hurricane. That rrogant spirit of\r\nincredulity, which rejects facts without attempting to investigate them, is\r\nin some cases almost more injurious than an unquestioning credulity.  Both\r\nare alike detrimental to the force of investigation.  Notwithstanding that\r\nfor more than two thousand years the annals of different nations had\r\nrecorded falls of meteoric stones, many of which had been attested beyond\r\nall doubt by the evidence of irreproachable eye-witnesses -- notwithstanding\r\nthe important part enacted by the Bætylia in the meteor-worship of the\r\nancients -- notwithstanding the fact of the companions of Cortez having see\r\nan aërolite at Cholula which had fallen on the neighboring pyramid --\r\nnotwithstanding that califs and Mongolian chiefs had caused swords to be\r\nforged from recently-fallen meteoric stones -- nay, notwithstanding that\r\nseveral persons had been struck dead by stones falling from heaven, as for\r\ninstance, a monk at Crema on the 4th of September, 1511, another monk at\r\nMilan in 1650, and two Swedish sailors on board ship in 1674, yet this great\r\ncosmical phenomenon remained almost wholly unheeded, and its intimate\r\nconnection drawn to the subject by Chladni, who had already gained immortal\r\nrenown by his discovery of the sound-figures.  He who is penetrated with a\r\nsense of this mysterious connection, and whose mind is open to deep\r\nimpressions of nature, will feel himself moved by the deepest and most\r\nsolemn emotion at the sight of every star that shoots across the vault of\r\nheaven, no less than at the glorious spectacle of meteoric swarms in the\r\nNovember phenomenon or on St. Lawrence's day.  Here motion is suddenly\r\nrevealed in the midst of nocturnal rest.  The still radiance of the vault of\r\nheaven is for a moment animated with life and movement.  In the mild\r\nradiance left on the track of the shooting star, imagination pictures the\r\nlengthened path of the meteor through the vault of heaven,\r\np 136\r\nwhile, every where around, the luminous asteroids proclaim the existence of\r\none common material universe.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the volume of the innermost of Saturn's satellites, or that of\r\nCeres, with the immense volume of the Sun, all relations of magnitude vanish\r\nfrom our minds.  The extinction of suddenly resplendent stars in Cassiopeia,\r\nCygnus, and Serpentarius have already led to the assumption of other and\r\nnon-luminous cosmical bodies.  We now know that the meteoric asteroids,\r\nspherically agglomerated into small masses, revolve round the Sun,\r\nintersect, like comets, the orbits of the luminous larger planets, and\r\nbecome ignited either in the vicinity of our atmosphere or in its upper\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThe only media by which we are brought in connection with other planetary\r\nbodies, and with all portions of the universe beyond our atmosphere, are\r\nlight and heat (the latter of which can scarcely be separated from the\r\nformer),* and those mysterious powers of attraction exercised by remote\r\nmasses, according to the quantity of their constituents, upon our globe, the\r\nocean, and the strata of our atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote'  *The following remarkable passage on the radiation of heat from\r\nthe fixed stars, and on their low combustion and vitality -- one of Kepler's\r\nmany aspirations -- occurs in the 'Paralipom. in Vitell. Astron.\r\nparsOpticqa', 1604, Propos. xxxii., p. 25:  \"Luciis proprium est calor,\r\nsydera omnia calefaciunt.  De syderum luce claritatis ratio testatur,\r\ncalorem universorum in minori esse proportione ad calorem unius solis, quam\r\nut ab homine, cujus est certa caloris mensura, utrque simul percipi et\r\njudicari possit.  De cincindularum lucula tenuissima negare non potes, quin\r\ncum calore sit.  Vivunt enim et moventur, hoc auten non sine calefactione\r\nperficitur.  Sic neque putrescentium lignorum lux sui calore destituitur;\r\nnam ipsa puetredo quidam lentus ignis est.  Inest et stirpibus suus calor.\"\r\n(Compare Kepler, 'Epit. Astron. Copernicanæ', 1618, t. i., lib. i., p. 35.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother and different kind of cosmical, or, rather, material mode of contact\r\nis, however, opened to us, if we admit falling stars and meteoric stones to\r\nbe planetary asteroids.  They not only act upon us merely from a distance by\r\nthe excitement of luminous or calorific vibrations, or in obedience to the\r\nlaws of mutual attraction, but they acquire an actual material existence for\r\nus, reaching our atmosphere from the remoter regions of universal space, and\r\nremaining on the earth itself.  Meteoric stones are the only means by which\r\nwe can be brought in possible contact with that which is foreign to our own\r\nplanet.  Accustomed to gain our knowledge of what is not telluric solely\r\nthrough measurement, calculations, and the deductions of reason, we\r\nexperience a sentiment of astonishment at finding that we may examine,\r\nweigh, and analyze bodies that appertain\r\np 137\r\nto the outer world.  This awakens, by the power of the imagination, a\r\nmeditative, spiritual train of thought, where the untutored mind perceives\r\nonly scintillations of light in the firmament, and sees in the blackened\r\nstone that falls from the exploded cloud nothing beyond the rough product of\r\na powerful natural force.\r\n\r\nAlthough the asteroid-swarms, on which we have been led, from special\r\npredilection, to dwell somewhat at length, approximate to a certain degree,\r\nin their inconsiderable mass and the diversity of their orbits, to comets,\r\nthey present this essential difference from the latter bodies, that our\r\nknowledge of their existence is almost entirely limited to the moment of\r\ntheir destruction, that is, to the period when, drawn within the sphere of\r\nthe Earth's attraction they become luminous and ignite.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete our view of all that we have learned to consider as\r\nappertaining to our solar system, which now, since the discovery of the\r\nsmall planets, of the interior comets of short revolutions, and of the\r\nmeteoric asteroids, is so rich and complicated in its form, it remains for\r\nus to speak of the ring of Zodiacal light, to which we have already alluded.\r\n Those who have lived for many years in the zone of palms must retain a\r\npleasing impression of the mild radiance with which the zodiacal light,\r\nshooting pyramidally upward, illumines a part of the uniform length of\r\ntropical nights.  I have seen it shine with an intensity of light equal to\r\nthe milky way in Sagittarius, and that not only in the rare and dry\r\natmosphere of the summits of the Andes, at an elevation of from thirteen to\r\nfifteen thousand feet, but even on the boundless grassy plains, the Illanos\r\nof Venezuela, and on the sea-shore, beneath the ever-clear sky of Cumana.\r\nThis phenomenon was often rendered especially beautiful by the passage of\r\nlight, fleecy clouds, which stood out in picturesque and bold relief from\r\nthe luminous back-ground.  A notice of this aërial spectacle is contained\r\nin a passage in my journal, while I was on the voyage from Lima to the\r\nwestern coasts of Mexico:  \"For three or four nights (between 10ºdegrees\r\nand 14ºdegrees north latitude) the zodiacal light has appeared in greater\r\nsplendor than I have ever observed it.  The transparency of the atmosphere\r\nmust be remarkably great in this part of the Southern Ocean, to judge by the\r\nradiance of the stars and nebulous spots.  From the 14th to the 19th of\r\nMarch a regular interval of three quarters of an hour occurred between the\r\ndisappearance of the sun's disk in the ocean and the first manifestation of\r\nthe zodiacal\r\np 138\r\nlight, although the night was already perfectly dark. an hour after sunset\r\nit was seen in great briliancy between Aldebaran and the Pleiades; and on\r\nthe 18th of March it attained an altitude of 39ºdegrees5'minutes.  Narrow\r\nelongated clouds are scattered over the beautiful deep azure of the distant\r\nhorizon, flitting past the zodiacal light as before a golden curtain.  Above\r\nthese, other clouds are from time to time reflecting the most brightly\r\nvariegated colors.  It seems a second sunset.  On this side of the vault of\r\nheaven the lightness of the night appears to increase almost as much as at\r\nthe first quarter of the moon.  Toward 10 o'clock the zodiacal light\r\ngenerally becomes very faint in this part of the Southern Ocean, and at\r\nmidnight I have scarcely been able to trace a vestige of it.  On the 16th of\r\nMarch, when most strongly luminous a faint reflection was visible in the\r\neast.\"  In our gloomy so-called \"temperate\" northern zone, the zodiacal\r\nlight is only distinctly visible in the beginning of Spring, after the\r\nevening twilight, in the western part of the sky, and at the close of\r\nAutumn, before the dawn of day, above the eastern horizon.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how so striking a natural phenomenon should\r\nhave failed to attract the attention of physicists and astronomers until the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, or how it could have escaped the\r\nobservation of the Atabian natural philosophers in ancient Bactria, on the\r\neuphrates, and in the south of Spain.  Almost equal surprise is excited by\r\nthe tardiness of observation of the nebulous spots in Andromeda and Orion,\r\nfirst described by Simon Marius and Huygens.  The earliest explicit\r\ndescriptions of the zodiacal light occurs in Childrey's 'Britannia\r\nBaconica',* in the year 1661.\r\np 139\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"There is another thing which I recommend to the observation of\r\nmathematical men, which is that in February, and for a little before and a\r\nlittle after that month (as I have observed several years together), about\r\nsix in the evening, when the twilight hath almost deserted the horizon, you\r\nshall see a plainly discernible way of the twilight striking up toward the\r\nPleiades, and seeming almost to touch them.  It is so observed any clear\r\nnight, but it is best illac nocte.  There is no such way to be observed at\r\nany other time of the year (that I can perceive), nor any other way at that\r\ntime to be perceived darting up elsewhere; and I believe it hath been, and\r\nwill be constantly visible at that time of the year; but what the cause of\r\nit in nature should be, I can not yet imagine, but leave it to future\r\ninquiry.\"  (Childrey, 'Britannia Baconica', 1661, p. 183.)  This is the\r\nfirst view and a simple description of the phenomenon.  (Cassini,\r\n'Découverte de la Lumi        dfd  éleste qui paroît dans le Zodiaque', in the\r\n'Mém. de l'Acad.', t. viii., 1730, p 276.  Mairan, 'TraitéPhys de l'Aurore\r\nBoréale', 1754, 0. 16.)  In this remarkable work by Childrey there are to\r\nbe found (p. 91) very clear accounts of the epochs of maxima and minima\r\ndiurnal and annual temperatures, and of the retardation of the extremes of\r\nthe effects in meteorological processes.  It is, however, to be regretted\r\nthat our Baconian-philosophy-loving author, who was Lord Henry Somerset's\r\nchaplain, fell into the same error as Bernardin de St. Pierre, and regarded\r\nthe Earth as elongated at the poles (see p. 148).  At the first he believes\r\nthat the Earth was spherical, but supposes that the uninterrupted and\r\nincreasing addition of layers of ice at both poles has changed its figure;\r\nand that as the ice is formed from water, the quantity of that liquid is\r\nevery where diminishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first observation of the phenomenon may have been made two or three\r\nyears prior to this period; but, notwithstanding, the merit of having (in\r\nthe spring of 1683) been the first to investigate the phenomenon in all its\r\nrelations in space is incontestably due to Dominicus Cassini.  The light\r\nwhich he saw at Bologna in 1668, and which was observed at the same time in\r\nPersia by the celebrated traveler Chardin (the court astrologers of Ispahan\r\ncalled this light, which had never before been observed, 'nyzek', a small\r\nlance), was not the zodiacal light, as has often been asserted,* but the\r\np 140\r\nenormous tail of a comet, whose head was concealed in the vapory mist of the\r\nhorizon, and which, from its length and appearance, presented much\r\nsimilarity to the great comet of 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dominicus Cassini ('Mém. de l'Acad.', t. viii., 1730, p. 188),\r\nand Mairan ('Aurore Bor.', p. 16), have even maintained that the phenomenon\r\nobserved in Persia in 1668 was the zodiacal light.  Delambre ('Hist. de\r\nl'Astron. Moderne', t. ii., p. 742), in very decided trms ascribes the\r\ndiscovery of this light to the celebrated traveler Chardin; but in the\r\n'Couronnement de Soliman', and in several passages of the narrative of his\r\ntravels (éd. de Langlès. t. iv., p. 326; t. x., p. 97), he only applies\r\nthe term niazouk (nyzek), or \"petite lance,\" to \"the great and famous comet\r\nwhich appeared over nearly the whole world in 1668, and whose head was so\r\nhidden in the wewst that it could not be perceived in the horizon of\r\nIspahan\" ('Atlas du Voyage de Chardin', Tab. iv.; from the observations at\r\nSchiraz).  The head or nucleus of the comet was, however, visible in the\r\nBrazils and in India (Pingré, 'Cométogr.', t. ii., p. 22).  Regarding the\r\nconjectured identity of the last great comet of March, 1843, with this,\r\nwhich Cassini mistook for the zodiacal light, see Schum., 'Astr. Nachr.',\r\n1843, No. 476 and 480.  In Persian, the term \"nizehi âteschîn\"(fiery\r\nspears or lances) is also applied to the rays of the rising or setting sun,\r\nin the same way as \"nayâzik,\" according to Freytag's Arabic Lexicon,\r\nsignifies \"stellæ cadentes.\"  The comparison of comets to lances and swords\r\nwas, however, in the Middle Ages, very common in all languages.  The great\r\ncomet of 1500, which was visible from April to June, was always termed by\r\nthe Italian writers of that time 'il Signor Astone' (see my 'Examen Critique\r\nde l'Hist. de la Géographie', t. v., p. 80).  All the hypotheses that have\r\nbeen advanced to show that Descartes (Cassini, p. 230; Mairan, p. 16), and\r\neven Kepler (Delambre, t. i., p. 601), were acquainted with the zodiacal\r\nlight, appear to me altogether untenable.  Descartes ('Principes', iii.,\r\nart. 136, 137) is very obscure in his remarks on comets, observing that\r\ntheir tails are formed \"by oblique rays, which, falling on different parts\r\nof the planetary orbs, strike the eye laterally by extraordinary\r\nrefraction,\" and that they might be seen morning and evening, \"like a long\r\nbeam,\" when the Sun is between the comet and the Earth.  This passage no\r\nmore refers to the zodiacal light than those in which Kepler ('Epit. Astron.\r\nCopernicanæ', t. i., p. 57, and t. ii., p. 893) speaks of the existence of\r\na solar atmosphere (limbus circa solem, coma lucida), which, in eclipses of\r\nthe Sun, prevents it \"from being quite night:\" and even more uncertain, or\r\nindeed erroneous, is the assumption that the \"trabes quas [Greek word]\r\nvocant\" (Plin., ii., 26 and 27) had reference to the tongue-shaped rising\r\nzodiacal light, as Cassini (p. 231, art. xxxi.) and Mairan (p. 15) have\r\nmaintained.  Every where among the ancients the trabes are associated with\r\nthe bolides (ardores et faces) and other fiery meteors, and even with\r\nlong-barbed comets.  (Regarding [Greek words] . see Schäfer, 'Schol. Par.\r\nad Apoll. Rhod.', 1813, t. ii., p. 206; Pseudo-Aristot., 'de Mundo, 2, 9;\r\n'Comment. Alex. Joh. Philop. et Olymp. in Aristot. Meteor.', lib. i., cap.\r\nvii., 3, p. 195, Ideler; Seneca, 'Nat. Quæst.', i., 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may conjecture, with much probability, that the remarkable light on the\r\nelevated plains of Mexico, seen for forty nights consecutively i8n 1509, and\r\nobserved in the eastern horizon rising pyramidally from the earth, was the\r\nzodiacal light.  I found a notice of this phenomenon in an ancient Aztec\r\nMS., the 'CodexTelleriano-Remensis',* preserved in the Royal Library at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Monumens des Peuples Indigènes de l'Amérique', t.\r\nii., p. 301.  The rare manuscript which belonged to the Archbishop of\r\nRheims, Le Tellier, contains various kinds of extracts from an Aztec ritual,\r\nan astrological calendar, and historical annals, extending from 1197 to\r\n1549, and embracing a notice of different natural phenomena, epochs of\r\nearthquakes and comets (as, for instance, those of 1490 and 1529), and of\r\n(which are important in relation to Mexican chronology) solar eclipses.  In\r\nCamargo's manuscript 'Historia de Tlascala', the light rising in the east\r\nalmost to the zenith is, singularly enough, described as \"sparkling, and as\r\nif sown with stars.\"  The description of this phenomenon, which lasted forty\r\ndays, can not in any way apply to volcanic eruptions of Popcatepetl, which\r\nlies very near, in the southeastery direction.  (Prescott, 'History of the\r\nConquest of Mesico', vol. i., p. 284.)  Later commentators have confounded\r\nthis phenomenon, which Montezuma regarded as a warning of his misfortunes,\r\nwith the \"estrella que humeava\" (literally, 'which spring forth'; Mexican\r\n'choloa, to leap or spring forth').  With respect to the connection of this\r\nvapor with the star Citlal Choloha (Venus) and with \"the mountain of the\r\nstar\" (Citialtepetl, the volcano of Orizaba), see my 'Monumens', t. ii., p.\r\n303.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon, whose primordial antiquity can scarcely be doubted, and\r\nwhich was first noticed in Europe by Childrey and Dominicus Cassini, is not\r\nthe luminous solar atmosphere itself, since this can not, in accordance with\r\nmechanical laws, be more compressed than in the relation of 2 to 3, and\r\nconsequently can not be diffused beyond 9/20ths of Mercury's heliocentric\r\ndistance.  These same laws teach us that the altitude of the extreme\r\nboundaries of the atmosphere of a cosmical\r\np 141\r\nbody above its equator, that is to say, the point at which gravity and\r\ncentrifugal force are in equilibrium, must be the same as the altitude at\r\nwhich a satellite would rotate round the central body simultaneously with\r\nthe diurnal revolution of the latter.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde', p. 270; 'Mécanique\r\nCéleste', t. ii., p. 169 and 171; Schubert, 'Astr.', bd. iii., § 206.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis limitation of the solar atmosphere in its present concentrated\r\ncondition is especially remarkable when we compare the central body of our\r\nsystem with the nucleus of other nebulous stars.  Herschel has discovered\r\nseveral, in which the radius of the nebulous matter surrounding the star\r\nappeared at an angle of 150\".  On the assumption that the parallax is not\r\nfully equal to 1\", we find that the outermost nebulous layer of such a star\r\nmust be 150 times further from the central body than our Earth is from the\r\nSun.  If, therefore, the nebulous star were to occupy the place of our Sun,\r\nits atmosphere would not only include the orbit of Uranus, but even extend\r\neight times beyond it.•\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 408.  Compare Sir John\r\nHerschel's considerations on the volume and faintness of light of planetary\r\nnebulæ, in Mary Somerville's 'Connection of the Physical Sciences', 1835,\r\np. 108.  The opinion that the Sun is a nebulous star, whose atmosphere\r\npresents the phenomenon of zodiacal light, did not originate with Dominicus\r\nCassini, but was first promulgated by Mairan in 1730 ('Traité de l'Aurore\r\nBor.', p. 47 and 263; Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 412).  It is a\r\nrenewal of Kepler's views.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the narrow limitation of the Sun's atmosphere, which we have\r\njust described, we may with much probability regard the existence of a very\r\ncompressed annulus of nebulous matter,* revolving freely in space between\r\nthe orbits of Venus and Mars, as the material cause of the zodiacal light.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Cominicus Cassini was the first to assume, as did subsequently\r\nLaplace, Schubert, and Poisson, the hypothesis of a separate ring to explain\r\nthe form of the zodiacal light.  He says distinctly, \"If the orbits of\r\nMercury and Venus were visible (throughout their whole extent), we should\r\ninvariably observe them with the same figure and in the same position with\r\nregard to the Sun, and at the same time of the year with the zodiacal\r\nlight.\"  ('Mém. de l'Acad.', t. viii., 1730, p. 218, and Biot, in the\r\n'Comptes Rendus', 1836, t. iii., p. 666.)  Cassini believed that the\r\nnebulous ring of zodiacal light consisted of innumerable small planetary\r\nbodies revolving round the Sun.  He even went so far as to believe that the\r\nfall of fire-balls might be connected with the passage of the Earth through\r\nthe zodiacal nebulous ring.  Olmsted, and especially Biot (op. cit., p.\r\n673), have attempted to establish its connection with the November\r\nphenomenon -- a connection which Olbers doubts.  (Schum., 'Jahrb.', 1837, s.\r\n281.)  Regarding the question whether the place of the zodiacal light\r\nperfectly coincides with that of the Sun's equator, see Houzeau, in Schum.,\r\n'Astr. Nachr.', 1843, No. 492, s. 190.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs\r\np 142\r\nyet we certainly know nothing definite regarding its actual material\r\ndimensions; its augmentation* by emanations from the tails of myriads of\r\ncomets that come within the Sun's vicinity; the singular changes affecting\r\nits expansion, since it sometimes does not apper to extend beyond our\r\nEarth's orbit; or, lastly, regarding its conjectural intimate connection\r\nwith the more condensed cosmical vapor in the vicinity of the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Sir John Herschel, 'Astron.', § 487.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nebulous particles composing this ring, and revolving round the sun in\r\naccordance with planetary laws, may either be self-luminous or receive light\r\nfrom that luminary.  Even in the case of a terrestrial mist (and this fact\r\nis very remarkable), which occurred at the time of the new moon at midnight\r\nin 1743, the phosphorescence was so intense that objects could be distinctly\r\nrecognized at a distance of more than 600 feet.\r\n\r\nI have occasionally been astonished in the tropical climates of south\r\namerica, to observe the variable intensity of the zodiacal light.  As i\r\npassed the nights, during many months, in the open air, on the shores of\r\nrivers and on ilanos, i enjoyed ample opportunities of carefully examining\r\nthis phenomenon.  When the zodiacal light had been most intense, i have\r\nobserved that it would be perceptibly weakened for a few minutes, until it\r\nagain suddenly shone forth in full brilliancy.  In some few instances i have\r\nthought that i could perceive -- not exactly a reddish coloration, nor the\r\nlower portion darkened in an arc-like form, nor even a scintillation, as\r\nmairan affirms he has observed -- but a kind of flickering and wavering of\r\nthe light.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1832, p. 246.  Several physical facts\r\nappear to indicate that, in a mechanical separation of matter into its\r\nsmallest particles, if the mass be very small in relation to the surface,\r\nthe electrical tension may increase sufficiently for the production of light\r\nand heat.  Experiments with a large concave mirror have not hitherto given\r\nany positive evidence of the presence of radiant heat in the zodiacal light.\r\n (Lettre de M. Matthiessen à M. Arago, in the 'Comptes Rendus', t. xvi.,\r\n1843, Avril, p. 687.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMust we suppose that changes are actually in progress in the nebulous ring?\r\nor is it not more probable that, although I could not, by my meteorological\r\ninstruments, detect any change of heat or moisture near the ground, and\r\nsmall stars of the fifth and sixth magnitudes appeared to shine with equally\r\nundiminished intensity of light, processes of condensation may be going on\r\nin the uppermost strata of the air, by means of which the transparency, or\r\nrather, the reflection of light, may be modified in some peculiar and\r\nunknown manner?\r\np 143\r\nAn assumption of the existence of such meteorological causes on the confines\r\nof our atmosphere is strengthened by the \"sudden flash and pulsation of\r\nlight,\" which, according to the acute observations of Olbers, vibrated for\r\nseveral seconds through the tail of a comet, which appeared during the\r\ncontinuance of the pulsations of light to be lengthened by several degrees,\r\nand then again contracted.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"What you tell me of the changes of light in the zodiacal\r\nlight, and of the causes to which you ascribe such changes within the\r\ntropics, is of the greatr interest to me, since I have been for a long time\r\npast particularly attentive, every spring, to this phenomenon in our\r\nnorthern latitudes.  I, too, have always believed that the zodiacal light\r\nrotated; but I assumed (contrary to Poisson's opinion, which you have\r\ncommunicated to me) that it completely extended to the Sun, with\r\nconsiderably augmenting brightness.  The light circle which, in total solar\r\neclipses, is seen surrounding the darkened Sun, I have regarded as the\r\nbrightest portion of the zodiacal light.  I have convinced my self that this\r\nlight is very different in different years, often for several successive\r\nyears being very bright and diffused, while in othr years it is scarcely\r\nperceptible.  I tyhink that I find the first trace of an allusion to the\r\nzodiacal light in a letter from Rothmann to Tycho, in which he mentions that\r\nin the spring he has observed the twilight did not close until the sun was\r\n24ºdegrees below the horizon.  Rothmann must certainly have confounded the\r\ndisappearance of the setting zodiacal light in the vapors of the western\r\nhorizon with the actual cessation of twilight.  I have failed to observe the\r\npulsations of the light, probably on account of the faintness with which it\r\nappears in these countries.  You are, however, certainly right in ascribing\r\nthose rapid variations in the light of the heavenly bodies, which you have\r\nperceived in tropical climates, to our own atmosphere, and especially to its\r\nhigher regions.  This is especially in the clearest weather, that these\r\ntails exhibit pulsations, commencing from the head, as being the lowest\r\npart, and vibrating in one or two seconds through the entire tail, which\r\nthus appears rapidly to become some degrees longer, but again as rapidly\r\ncontracts.  That these undulations, which were formerly noticed with\r\nattention by Robert Hooke, and in more recent times by Schröter and\r\nChladni, 'do not actually occur in the tails of the comets', but are\r\nproduced by our atmosphere, is obvious when we recollect that the individual\r\nparts of those tails (which are many millions of miles in length) lie 'at\r\nvery different distances' from us, and that the light from their extreme\r\npoints can only reach us at intervals of time which differ several minutes\r\nfrom one another.  Whether what you saw on the Orinoco, not at intervals of\r\nseconds, but of minutes, were actual coruscations of the zodiacal light, or\r\nwhether they belonged exclusively to the upper strata of our atmosphere, I\r\nwill not attempt to decide; neither can I explain the remarkable 'lightness\r\nof whole nights', nor the anomalous augmentation and prolongation of the\r\ntwilight in the year 1831, particularly if, as has been remarked, the\r\nlightest part of these singular twilights did not coincide with the Sun's\r\nplace below the horizon.\"  (From a lettr written by Dr. Olbers to myself,\r\nand dated Bremen, Marth 26th, 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs, however, the separate particles of a comet's tail, measuring millions of\r\nmiles,\r\np 144\r\nare very unequally distant from earth, it is not possible, according to the\r\nlaws of the velocity and transmission of light, that we should be able, in\r\nso short a period of time, to perceive any actual changes in a cosmical body\r\nof such vast extent.  There considerations in no way exclude the realith of\r\nthe changes that have been observed in the emanations from the more\r\ncondensed envelopes around the nucleus of a comet, nor that of the sudden\r\nirradiation of the zodiacal light, from internal molecular motion, nor of\r\nthe increased or diminished reflection of light in the cosmical vapor of the\r\nluminous ring, but should simply be the means of drawing our attention to\r\nthe differences existing between that which appertains to the air of heaven\r\n(the realms of universal space) and that which belongs to the strata of our\r\nterrestrial atmosphere.  It is not possible, as well-attested facts prove,\r\nperfectly to explain the operations at work in the much-contested upper\r\nboundaries of our atmosphere.  The extraordinary lightness of whole nights\r\nin the year 1831, during which small print might be read at midnight in the\r\nlatitudes of Italy and the north of Germany is a fact directly at variance\r\nwith all that we know, according to the most recent and acute researches on\r\nthe crepuscular theory, and of the height of the atmosphere.*\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Biot, 'Traité d'Astron. Physique', 3ème éd., 1841, t. i., p.\r\n171, 238 and 312.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of light depend upon conditions still less understood, and\r\ntheir variability at twilight, as well as in the zodiacal light, excite our\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered that which belongs to our solare system -- that\r\nworld of material forms governed by the Sun -- which includes the primary\r\nand secondary planets, comets of short and long periods of revolution,\r\nmeteoric asteroids, which move thronged together in streams, either\r\nsporadically or in closed rings, and finally a luminous nebulous ring, that\r\nrevolves round the Sun in the vicinity of the Earth, and for which, owing to\r\nits position, we may retain the name of zodiacal light.  Every where the law\r\nof periodicity governs the motions of these bodies, however different may be\r\nthe amount of tangential velocity, or the quantity of their agglomerated\r\nmaterial parts; the meteoric asteroids which enter our atmosphere from the\r\nexternal regions of universal space are alone arrested in the course of\r\ntheir planetary revolution, and retained within the sphere of a larger\r\nplanet.  In the solar system, whose boundaries determine the attractive\r\nforce of the central body, comets are made to revolve in their elliptical\r\np 145\r\norbits at a distance 44 times greater than that of Uranus; may, in those\r\ncomets whose nucleus appears to us, from its inconsiderable mass, like a\r\nmere passing cosmical cloud, the Sun exercises its attractive force on the\r\noutermost parts of the emanations radiating from the tail over a space of\r\nmany millions of miles.  Central forces, therefore, at once constitute and\r\nmaintain the system.\r\n\r\nOur Sun may be considered as at rest when compared to all the large and\r\nsmall, dense and almost vaporous cosmical bodies tht appertain to and\r\nrevolve around it; but it actually rotates around the common center of\r\ngravity of the whole system, which occasionally falls within itself, that is\r\nto say, remains within the material circumference of the Sun, whatever\r\nchanges may be assumed by the position of the planets.  A very different\r\nphenomenon is that presented by the translatory motion of the Sun, that is,\r\nthe progressive motion of the center of gravity of the whole solar system in\r\nuniversal space.  Its velocity is such* that, according to Bessel, the\r\nrelative motion of the Sun, and that of 61 Cygni, is not less in one day\r\nthan 3,336,000 geographical miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bessel, in Schum., 'Jahrb. für' 1839, s. 51; probably four\r\nmillions of miles daily, in a relative velocity of at the least 3,336,000\r\nmiles, or more than couble the velocity of revolution of the Earth in her\r\norbit round the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change of the entire solar system would remain unknown to us, if the\r\nadmirable exactness of our astronomical instruments of measurement, and the\r\nadvancement recently made in the art of observing, did not cause our advance\r\ntoward remote stars to be perceptible, like an approximation to the objects\r\nof a distant shore in apparent motion.  The proper motion of the star 61\r\nCygni, for instance, is so considerable, that it has amounted to a whole\r\ndegree in the course of 700 years.\r\n\r\nThe amount or quantity of these alterations in the fixed stars (that is to\r\nsay, the changes in the relative position of self-luminous stars toward each\r\nother), can be determined with a greater degree of certainty than we are\r\nable to attach to the genetic explanation of the phenomenon.  After taking\r\ninto consideration what is due to the precession of the equinoxes, and the\r\nnutation of the earth's axis produced by the action of the Sun and Moon on\r\nthe spheroidal figure of our globe, and what may be ascribed to the\r\ntransmission of light, that is to say, to its aberration, and to the\r\nparallax formed by the diametrically opposite position of the Earth in its\r\ncourse round the Sun, we still find that there is a residual portion\r\np 146\r\nof the annual motion of the fixed stars due to the translation of the whole\r\nsolar system in universal space, and to the true proper motion of the stars.\r\n The difficult problem of numerically separating these two elements, the\r\ntrue and the apparent motion, has been effected by the careful study of the\r\ndirection of the motion of certain individual stars, and by the\r\nconsideration of the fact that, if all the stars were in a state of absolute\r\nrest, they would appear perspectively to recede from the point in space\r\ntoward which the Sun was directing its course.  But the ultimate result of\r\nthis investigation, confirmed by the calculus of probabilities, is, that our\r\nsolar system and the stars both change their places in space.  According to\r\nthe admirable researches of d'Argelander at Abo, who has extended and more\r\nperfectly developed the work begun by William Herschel and Prevost, the Sun\r\nmoves in the direction of the constellation Hercules, and probably, from the\r\ncombination of the observations made of 537 stars, toward a point lying (at\r\nthe equinox of 1792.5) at 257ºdegrees 49.'7 R.A., and 28ºdegrees 49.'7\r\nN.D.  It is extremely difficult, in investigations of this nature, to\r\nseparate the absolute from the relative motion, and to determine what is\r\naloone owing to the solar system.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Regarding the motion of the solar system, according to Bradley,\r\nTobias Mayer, Lambert, Lalande, and William Herschel, see Arago in the\r\n'Annuaire', 1842, p. 388-399' Argelander, in Schum., 'Astron.

The last-named astronomer has found, by a mo4re\r\nrecent combination, 261ºdegrees 23' R.A.+37ºdegrees 36' Decl. for the\r\ndirection of the Sun's motion; and, taking the mean of his own results with\r\nthat of Argelander, we have, by a combination of 797 stars, the formula\r\n259ºdegrees 9' R.A.+34ºdegrees 36' Decl.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we consider the proper, and not the perspective motions of the stars, we\r\nshall find many that appear to be distributed in groups, having an opposite\r\ndirection; and facts hitherto observed do not, at any rate, render it a\r\nnecessary assumption that all parts of our starry stratum, or the whole of\r\nthe stellar islands filling space, should move round one large unknown\r\nluminous or non-luminous central body.  The tendency of the human mind to\r\ninvestigate ultimate and highest causes certainly inclines the intellectual\r\nactivity, no less than the imagination of mankind, to adopt such an\r\nhypothesis.  Even the Stagirite proclaimed that \"every thing which is moved\r\nmust be referable to a motor, and that there would be no end to\r\np 147\r\nthe concatenation of causes if there were not one primordial immovable\r\nmorot.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Aristot., 'de Cælo', iii., 2, p. 301, Bekker:  'Phys.', viii.,\r\nt, p. 256.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis material taken from pages 147-203\r\n\r\nCOSMOS: A Sketch of the Physical Description of the Universe, Vol. 1\r\nby Alexander von Humboldt\r\n\r\nTranslated by E C Otte\r\n\r\nfrom the 1858 Harper & Brothers edition of Cosmos, volume 1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe manifold translatory changes of the stars, not those produced by the\r\nparallaxes at which they are seen from the changing position of the\r\nspectator, but the true changes constantly going on in the regions of space,\r\nafford us incontrovertible evidence of the 'dominion of the laws of\r\nattraction' in the remotest regions of space, beyond the limits of our solar\r\nsystem.  The existence of these laws is revealed to us by many phenomena,\r\nas, for instance, by the motion of double stars, and by the amount of\r\nretarded or accelerated motion in different parts of their elliptic orbits.\r\nHuman inquiry need no longer pursue this subject in the domain of vague\r\nconjecture, or amid the undefined analogies of the ideal world; for even\r\nhere the progress made in the method of astronomical observations and\r\ncalculations has enabled astronomy to take up its position on a firm basis.\r\nIt is not only the discovery of the astounding numbers of double and\r\nmultiple stars revolving round a center of gravity lying 'without' their\r\nsystem (2800 such systems having been discovered up to 1837), but rather the\r\nextension of our knowledge regarding the fundamental forces of the whole\r\nmaterial world, and the proofs we have obtained of the universal empire of\r\nthe laws of attraction, that must be ranked among the most brilliant\r\ndiscoveries of the age.  The periods of revolution of colored stars present\r\nthe greatest differences; thus, in some instances, the period extends to 43\r\nyears, as in πpi of Corona, and in others to several thousands,, as in 66\r\nof Cetus, 38 of Gemini, and 100 of Pisces.  Since Herschel's measurements in\r\n1782, the satellite of the nearest star in the triple system of [Greek\r\nletter] of Cancer has completed more than one entire revolution.  By a\r\nskillful combination of the altered distances and angles of position,* the\r\nelements of these orbits may be found, conclusions drawn regarding the\r\nabsolute distance of the double stars from the Earth, and comparisons made\r\nbetween their mass and that of the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Savary, in the 'Connaissance des Tems', 1830, p. 56 and 163.\r\nEncke, 'Berl.

Gotting.', 1804-1808, vol. xvi., p. 31-68.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we compare our Sun with the other fixed stars, that is, with other\r\nself-luminous Suns in the lenticular starry stratum of which our system\r\nforms a part, we find, at least in the case of some, that channels are\r\nopened to us, which may lead, at all events, to an 'approximate' and limited\r\nknowledge of their relative distances, volumes, and masses, and of the\r\nvelocities of their translatory motion.  If we assume the distance of Uranus\r\nfrom the Sun to be nineteen times that of the Earth, that is to say,\r\nnineteen times as great as that of the Sun from the Earth, the central body\r\nof our planetary system will be 11,900 times the distance of Uranus from the\r\nstar 'a' in the constellation Centaur, almost 31,300 from 61 Cygni, and\r\n41,600 from Vega in the constellation Lyra.  The comparison of the volume of\r\nthe Sun with that of the fixed stars of the first magnitude is dependent\r\nupon the apparent diameter of the latter bodies -- an extremely undertain\r\noptical element.  If even we assume, with Herschel, that the apparent\r\ndiameter of Arcturus is only a tenth part of a second, it still follows that\r\nthe true diameter of this star is eleven times greater than that of the Sun.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'Philos. Trans.' for 1803, p. 225.  Arago, in the 'Annuaire',\r\n1842, p. 375.  In order to obtain a clearer idea of the distances ascribed\r\nin a rather earlier part of the text to the fixed stars, let us assume that\r\nthe Earth is a distance of one foot from the Sun; Uranus is then 19 feet,\r\nand Vega Lyrae is 158 geographical miles from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distance of the star 61 Cygni, made known by Bessel, has led\r\napproximately to a knowledge of the quantity of matter contained in this\r\nbody as a double star.  Notwithstanding that, since Bradley's observations,\r\nthe portion of the apparent orbit traversed by this star is not sufficiently\r\ngreat to admit of our arriving with perfect exactness at the true orbit nd\r\nthe major axis of this star, it has been conjectured with much probability\r\nby the great Konigsberg astronomer,* \"that the mass of this double star can\r\nnot be very considerably larger or smaller than half of the mass of the\r\nSun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bessel, in Schum., 'Jahrb.', 1839, s. 53.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis result is from actual measurement.  The analogies deduced from the\r\nrelatively larger mass of those planets in our solar system that are\r\nattended by satellites, and from the fact that Struve has discovered six\r\ntimes more double stars among\r\np 194\r\nthe brighter than among the telescopic fixed stars, have led other\r\nastronomers to conjecture that the average mass of the larger number of the\r\nbinary stars exceeds the mass of the Sun.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Mädler, 'Astron.', s. 476; also in Schum, 'Jahrb.', 1839, s.\r\n95.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are, however, far from having arrived at general results regarding this\r\nsubject.  Our Sun, according to Argenlander, belongs, with reference to\r\nproper motion in space, to the class of rapidly-moving fixed stars.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the starry heavens, the relative position of stars and\r\nnebullae, the distribution of their luminous masses, the picturesque beauty,\r\nif I may so express myself, of the whole firmament, depend in the course of\r\nages conjointly upon the proper motion of the stars and nebulae, the\r\ntranslation of our solar system in space, the appearance of new stars, and\r\nthe disappearance or sudden diminution in the intensity of the light of\r\nothers, and lastly and specially, on the changes which the Earth's axis\r\nexperiences from the attraction of the Sun and Moon.  The beautiful stars in\r\nthe constellation of the Centaur and the Southern Cross will at some future\r\ntime be visible in our northern latitudes, while other stars, as Sirius and\r\nthe stars in the Belt of Orion, will in their turn disappear below the\r\nhorizon.  The places of the North Pole will successively be indicated by the\r\nstars ß beta and a alpha Cephei, and ∂ delta Cygni, until after a period\r\nof 12,000 years, Vega in Lyra will shine forth as the brightest of all\r\npossible pole stars.  These data give us some idea of the extent of the\r\nmotions which, divided into infinitely small portions of time, proceed\r\nwithout intermission in the great chronometer of the universe.  If for a\r\nmoment we could yield to the power of fancy, and imagine the acuteness of\r\nour visual organs to be made equal with the extremest bounds of telescopic\r\nvision, and bring together that which is now divided by long periods of\r\ntime, the apparent rest that reigns in space would suddenly disappear.  We\r\nshould see the countless host of fixed stars moving in thronged groups in\r\ndifferent directions; nebulae wandering through space, and becoming\r\ncondensed and dissolved like cosmical clouds; the vail of the Milky Way\r\nseparated and broken up in many parts, and 'motion' ruling supreme in every\r\nportion of the vault of heave, even as on the Earth's surface, where we see\r\nit unfolded in the germ, the leaf, and the blossom, the organisms of the\r\nvegetable world.  The celebrated Spanish botanist Cavanilles was the first\r\nwho entertained the idea of \"seeing grass grow,\" and he directed the\r\nhorizontal micrometer threads of a powerfully magnifying glass at one time to\r\np 150\r\nthe apex of the shoot of a bambusa, and at another on the rapidly-growing\r\nstem of an American aloe ('Agave Americana', precisely as the astronomer\r\nplaces his cross of net-work against a culminating star.  In the collective\r\nlife of physical nature, in the organic as in the sidereal world, all things\r\nthat have been, that are, and will be, are alike dependent on motion.\r\n\r\nThe breaking up of the Milky Way, of which I have just spoken, requires\r\nspecial notice.  William Herschel, our safe and admirable guide to this\r\nportion of the regions of space, has discovered by his star-guagings that\r\nthe telescopic breadth of the Milky Way extends from six to seven degrees\r\nbeyond what is indicated by our astronomical maps and by the extent of the\r\nsidereal radiance visible to the naked eye.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Sir William Herschel, in the 'Philos. Transact.' for 1817, Part\r\nii p. 438.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two brilliant nodes in which the branches of the zone unite, in the\r\nregion of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and in the vicinity of Scorpio and\r\nSagittarius, appear to exercise a powerful attraction on the contiguous\r\nstars; in the most brilliant part, however between beta and [Greek symbol]\r\nCygni, one half of the 330,000 stars that have been discovered in a breadth\r\nof 5 degrees are directed toward one side, and the remainder to the other.\r\nIt is in this part that Herschel supposes the layer to be broken up.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 569\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of telescopic stars in the Milky Way uninterrupted by any nebulae\r\nis estimated at 18 millions.  In order, I will not say, to realize the\r\ngreatness of this number, but, at any rate, to compare it with something\r\nanalogous, I will call attention to the fact that there are not in the whole\r\nheavens more than about 8000 stars between the first and the sixth\r\nmagnitudes, visible to the naked eye.  The barren astonishment excited by\r\nnumbers and dimensions in space, when not considered with reference to\r\napplications engaging the mental and perceptive powers of man, is awakened\r\nin both extremes of the universe, in the celestial bodies as in the minutest\r\nanimalcules.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Sir John Herschel, in a letter from Feldhuysen, dated Jan.\r\n13th, 1836.

The former constitutes,\r\naccording to Sir John Herschel's views, an annulus, that is to say, an\r\nindependent zone, somewhat remote from our lenticular-shaped starry stratum,\r\nand similar to Saturn's ring.  Our planetary system lies in an eccentric\r\ndirection, nearer to the region of the Cross than to the diametrically\r\nopposite point, Cassiopeia.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Sir John Herschel, 'Astronom.', 624; likewise in his\r\n'Observations on Nebulae and Clusters of Stars' ('Phil.

(\"The 'nebulous' region of the\r\nheavens forms 'a nebulous Milky Way', composed of distinct nebulae, as the\r\nother of stars.\"  The same observation was made in a letter he addressed to\r\nme in March, 1829.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way composed of nebulae does not belong to our starry stratum, but\r\nsurrounds it at a great distance without being physically connected with it,\r\npassing almost in the form of a large cross through the dense nebulae of\r\nVirgo, especially in the northern wing, through Comae Berenicis, Ursa Major,\r\nAndromeda's girdle, and Pisces Boreales.  It probably intersects the stellar\r\nMilky Way in Cassiopeia, and connects its dreary poles (rendered starless\r\nfrom the attractive forces by which stellar bodies are made to agglomerate\r\ninto groups) in the least dense portion of the starry stratum.\r\n\r\nWe see from these considerations that our starry cluster, which bears traces\r\nin its projecting branches of having been subject in the course of time to\r\nvarious metamorphoses, and evinces a tendency to dissolve and separate,\r\nowing to secondary centers of attraction -- is surrounded by two rings, one\r\nof which, the nebulous zone, is very remote, while the other is nearer, and\r\ncomposed of stars alone.  The latter, which we generally term the Milky Way,\r\nis composed of nebulous stars, averaging from the tenth to the eleventh\r\ndegree of magnitude,* but appearing, when considered individually, of very\r\ndifferent magnitudes, while isolated starry clusters (starry swarms) almost\r\nalways exhibit throughout a character of great uniformity in magnitude and\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Sir John Herschel, 'Astron.', 585.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn whatever part the vault of heaven has been pierced by powerful and\r\nfar-penetrating telescopic instruments, stars or luminous nebulae are every\r\nwhere discoverable, the former, in\r\np 152\r\nsome cases, not exceeding the twentieth or twenty-fourth degree of\r\ntelescopic magnitude.  A portion of the nebulous vapor would probably be\r\nfound resolvable into stars by more powerful optical instruments.  As the\r\nretina retains a less vivid impression of separate than of infinitely near\r\nluminous points, less strongly marked photometric relations are excited in\r\nthe latter case, as Arago has recently shown.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p. 282-285, 409-411, and\r\n439-442.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe definite or amorphous cosmical vapor so universally diffused, and which\r\ngenerates heat through condensation, probably modifies the transparency of\r\nthe universal atmosphere, and diminishes that uniform intensity of light\r\nwhich, according to Halley and Olbers, should arise, if every point\r\nthroughout the depths of space were filled by an infinite series of stars.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Olbers, on the transparency of celestial space, in Bode's\r\n'Jahrb.', 1826, s. 110-121.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assumption of such a distribution in space is, however, at variance with\r\nobservation, which shows us large starless regions of space, 'openings' in\r\nthe heavens, as William Herschel terms them -- one, four degrees in width,\r\nin Scorpio, and another in Serpentarius.  In the vicinity of both, near\r\ntheir margin, we find unresolvable nebulae, of which that on the western\r\nedge of the opening Scorpio is one of the most richly thronged of the\r\nclusters of small stars by which the firmament is adorned.  Herschel\r\nascribes these openings or starless regions to the attractive and\r\nagglomerative forcesof the marginal groups.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"An opening in the heavens,\" William Herschel, in the 'Phil.\r\nTrans.' for 1785, vol. lxxv., Part i., p. 256.

Other stars may certainly lie\r\nin those parts where the strata forming the canopy are interrupted, but\r\nthese are unattainable by our instruments.  The aspect of fiery meteors had\r\nled the ancients likewise to the idea of clefts or openings ('chasmata') in\r\nthe vault of heaven.  These openings were, however, only regarded as\r\ntransient, while the reason of their being luminous and fiery, instead of\r\nobscure, was supposed to be owing to the\r\np 153\r\ntranslucent illuminated ether which lay beyond them.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Aristot., 'Meteor.', ii.,, 5, 1.

The velocity of this propagation is\r\naccording to Struve's most recent investigations, 166,072 geographical miles\r\nin a second, consequently almost a million of times greater than the\r\nvelocity of sound.  According to the measurements of Maclear, Bessel, and\r\nStruve, of the parallaxes and distances of three fixed stars of very unequal\r\nmagnitudes ('a' Centauri, 16 Cygni, and 'a' Lyrae), a ray of light requires\r\nrespectively 3, 9 1/4, and 12 years to reach us from these three bodies.  In\r\nthe short but memorable period between 1572 and 1604, from the time of\r\nCornelius Gemma and Tycho Brahe to that of Kepler, three new stars suddenly\r\nappeared in Cassiopeia and Cygnus, and in the foot of Serpentarius.  A\r\nsimilar phenomenon exhibited itself at intervals in 1670, in the\r\nconstellation Vulpis.  In recent times, even since 1837, Sir John Herschel\r\nhas observed, at the Cape of Good Hope, the brilliant star [Greek symbol] in\r\nArgo increase in splendor from the second to the first magnitude.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *In December, 1837, Sir John Herschel saw the star [Greek\r\nsymbol] Argo, which till that time appeared as of the second magnitude, and\r\nliable to no change, rapidly increase till it became of the first magnitude.\r\n In January, 1838, the intensity of its light was equal to that of 'a'\r\nCentauri.  According to our latest information, Maclear in March, 1843,\r\nfound it as bright as Canopus; and even 'a' Crucis looked faint by [Greek\r\nsymbol] Argo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese events in the universe belong, however, with reference to their\r\nhistorical reality, to other periods of time than those in which the\r\nphenomena of light are first revealed to the inhabitants of the Earth:  they\r\nreach us like the voices of the past.  It has been truly said, that with our\r\nlarge and powerful telescopic instruments we penetrate alike through the\r\nboundaries of time and space:  we measure the former through the latter, for\r\nin the course of an\r\np 154\r\nhour a ray of light traverses over a space of 592 millions of miles.  While\r\naccording to the theogony of Hesiod, the dimensions of the universe were\r\nsupposed to be expressed by the time occupied by bodies in falling to the\r\nground (\"the brazen anvil was not more than nine days and nine nights in\r\nfalling from heaven to earth\"), the elder Herschel was of opinion* that\r\nlight required almost two millions of years to pass to the Earth from the\r\nremotest luminous vapor reached by his forty-foot reflector.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"Hence it follows that the rays of light of the remotest\r\nnebulae must have been almost two millions of years on their way, and that\r\nconsequently, so many years ago, this object must already have had an\r\nexistence in the sidereal heaven, in order to send out those rays by which\r\nwe now perceive it.\"  William Herschel, in the 'Phil. Trans.' for 1802, p.\r\n498.  John Herschel, 'Astron.', 590.  Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1842, p.\r\n334, 359, and 382-385.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch, therefore, has vanished long before it is rendered visible to us --\r\nmuch that we see was once differently arranged from what it now appears.\r\nThe aspect of the starry heavens presents us with the spectacle of that\r\nwhich is only apparently simultaneous, and however much we may endeavor, by\r\nthe aid of optical instruments, to bring the mildly-radiant vapor of\r\nnebulous masses or the faintly-glimmering starry clusters nearer, and\r\ndiminish the thousands of years interposed between us and them, that serve\r\nas a criterion of their distance, it still remains more than probable, from\r\nthe knowledge we possess of the velocity of the transmission of luminous\r\nrays, that the light of remote heavenly bodies presents us with the most\r\nancient perceptible evidence of the existence of matter.  It is thus that\r\nthe reflective mind of man is led from simple premises to rise to those\r\nexalted heights of nature, where in the light-illumined realms of space,\r\n\"myriads of worlds are bursting into life like the grass of the night.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[fotnote]  *From my brother's beautiful sonnet \"Freiheit und Gesetz.\"\r\n(Wilhelm von Humboldt, 'Gesammelte Werke', bd. iv., s. 358, No. 25.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the regions of celestial forms, the domain of Uranus, we will now\r\ndescend to the more contracted sphere of terrestrial forces -- to the\r\ninterior of the Earth itself.  A mysterious chain links together both\r\nclasses of phenomena.  According to the ancient signification of the Titanic\r\nmyth,* the powers of organic life, that is to say, the great order of\r\nnature, depend upon the combined action of heaven and earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Otfried Muller, 'Prolegomena', s. 373.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we suppose that the Earth, like all the other planets, primordially\r\nbelonged, according to its origin, to the central body, the Sun, and to the\r\nsolar atmosphere that has been separated into nebulous\r\np 155\r\nrings, the same connection with this continguous Sun, as well as with all\r\nthe remote suns that shine in the firmament, is still revealed through the\r\nphenomena of light and radiating heat.  The difference in the degree of\r\nthese actions must not lead the physicist, in his delineation of nature, to\r\nforget the connection and the common empire of similar forces in the\r\nuniverse.  A small fraction of telluric heat is derived from the regions of\r\nuniversal space in which our planetary system is moving, whose temperature\r\n(which according to Fourier, is almost equal to our mean icy polar heat) is\r\nthe result of the combined radiation of all the stars.  The causes that more\r\npowerfully excite the light of the Sun in the atmosphere and in the upper\r\nstrata of our air, that give rise to heat-engendering electric and magnetic\r\ncurrents, and awaken and genially vivify the vital spark in organic\r\nstructures on the earth's surface, must be reserved for the subject of our\r\nfuture consideration.\r\n\r\nAs we purpose for the present to confine ourselves exclusively within the\r\ntelluric sphere of nature, it will be expedient to cast a preliminary glance\r\nover the relations in space of solids and fluids, the form of the Earth, its\r\nmean density, and the partial distribution of this density in the interior\r\nof our planet, its temperature and its electro-magnetic tension.  From the\r\nconsideration of these relations in space, and of the forces inherent in\r\nmatter, we shall pass to the reaction of the interior on the exterior of our\r\nglobe; and to the special consideration of a universally distributed natural\r\npower -- subterranean heat; to the phenomena of earthquakes, exhibited in\r\nunequally expanded circles of commotion, which are not referable to the\r\naction of dynamic laws alone; to the springing forth of hot wells; and,\r\nlastly, to the more powerful actions of volcanic processes.  The crust of\r\nthe Earth, which may scarcely have been perceptibly elevated by the sudden\r\nand repeated, or almost uninterrupted shocks by which it has been moved from\r\nbelow, undergoes, nevertheless, great changes in the course of centuries in\r\nthe relations of the elevation of solid portions, when compared with the\r\nsurface of the liquid parts, and even in the form of the bottom of the sea.\r\nIn this manner simultaneous temporary or permanent fissures are opened, by\r\nwhich the interior of the Earth is brought in contact with the external\r\natmosphere.  Molten masses, rising from an unknown depth, flow in narrow\r\nstreams along the declivity of mountains, rushing impetuously onward, or\r\nmoving slowly and gently, until the fiery source is quenched in the midst of\r\nexhalations, and the lava becomes incrusted, as it were, by\r\np 156\r\nthe solidification of its outer surface.  New masses of rocks are thus\r\nformed before our eyes, while the older ones are in their turn converted\r\ninto other forms by the greater or lesser agency of Platonic forces.  Even\r\nwhere no disruption takes place the crystalline moleculres are displaced,\r\ncombining to form bodies of denser texture.  The water presents structures\r\nof a totally different nature, as, for instance, concretions of animal and\r\nvegetable remains, of earthy, calcareous, or aluminous precipitates,\r\nagglomerations of finely-pulverized mineral bodies, covered with layers of\r\nthe silicious shields of infusoria, and with transported soils containing\r\nthe bones of fossil animal forms of a more ancient world.  The study of the\r\nstrata which are so differently formed and arranged before our eyes, and of\r\nall that has been so variously dislocated, conforted, and upheaved, by\r\nmutual compression and volcanic force, leads the reflective observer, by\r\nsimple analogies, to draw a comparison between the present and an age that\r\nhas long passed.  It is by a combination of actual phenomena, by an ideal\r\nenlargement of relations in space, and of the amount of active forces, that\r\nwe are able to advance into the long sought and indefinitely anticipated\r\ndomain of geognosy, which has only within the last half century been based\r\non the solid foundation of scientific deduction.\r\n\r\nIt has been acutely remarked, \"that notwithstanding our continual employment\r\nof large telescopes, we are less acquainted with the exterior than with the\r\ninterior of other planets, excepting, perhaps, our own satellite.\"  They\r\nhave been weighed, and their volume measured; and their mass and density are\r\nbecoming known with constantly-increasing exactness; thanks to the progress\r\nmade in astronomical observation and calculation.  Their physical character\r\nis, however, hidden in obscurity, for it is only in our own globe that we\r\ncan be brought in immediate contact with all the elements of organic and\r\ninorganic creation.  The diversity of the most heterogenous substances,\r\ntheir admixtures and metamorphoses, and the ever-changing play of the forces\r\ncalled into action, afford to the human mind both nourishment and enjoyment,\r\nand open an immeasurable field of observation, from which the intellectual\r\nactivity of man derives a great portion of its grandeur and power.  The\r\nworld of perceptive phenomena is reflected in the depths of the ideal world,\r\nand the richness of nature and the mass of all that admits of classification\r\ngradually become the objects of inductive reasoning.\r\n\r\nI would here allude to the advantage, of which I have already\r\np 157\r\nspoken, possessed by that portion of physical science whose origin is\r\nfamiliar to us, and is connected with our earthly existence.  The physical\r\ndescription of celestial bodies from the remotely-glimmering nebulae with\r\ntheir suns, to the central body of our own system, is limited, as we have\r\nseen, to general conceptions of the volume and quantity of matter.  No\r\nmanifestation of vital activity is there presented to our senses.  It is\r\nonly from analogies, frequently from purely ideal combinations, that we\r\nhazard conjectures on the specific elements of matter, or on their various\r\nmodifications in the different planetary bodies.  But the physical knowledge\r\nof the heterogeneous nature of matter, its chemical differences, the regular\r\nforms in which its molecules combine together, whether in crystals or\r\ngranules; its relations to the deflected or decomposed waves of light by\r\nwhich it is penetrated; to radiating, transmitted, or polarized heat; and to\r\nthe brilliant or invisible, but not, on that account, less active phenomena\r\nof electro-magnetism -- all this inexhaustible treasure, by which the\r\nenjoyment of the contemplation of nature is so much heightened, is dependent\r\non the surface of the planet which we inhabit, and more on its solid than on\r\nits liquid parts.  I have already remarked how greatly the study of natural\r\nobjects and forces, and the infinite diversity of the sources they open for\r\nour consideration, strengthen the mental activity, and call into action\r\nevery manifestation of intellectual progress.  These relations require,\r\nhowever, as little comment as that concatenation of causes by which\r\nparticular nations are permitted to enjoy a superiority over others in the\r\nexercise of a material power derived from their command of a portion of\r\nthese elementary forces of nature.\r\n\r\nIf, on the one hand, it were necessary to indicate the difference existing\r\nbetween the nature of our knowledge of the Earth and of that of the\r\ncelestial regions and their contents, I am no less desirous, on the other\r\nhand, to draw attention to the limited boundaries of that portion of\r\nspacefrom which we derive all our knowledge of the heterogeneous character\r\nof matter.  This has been somewhat inappropriately termed the Earth's crust;\r\nit includes the strata most contiguous to the upper surface of our planet,\r\nand which have been laid open before us by deep fissure-like valleys, or by\r\nthe labors of man, in the bores and shafts formed by miners.  These labors*\r\ndo not extend beyond a vertical depth of somewhat more than 2000 feet (about\r\none third of a geographical mile) below the\r\np 159\r\nlevel of the sea, and consequently only about 1/9800th of the Earth's\r\nradius.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *In speaking of the greatest depths within the Earth reached by\r\nhuman labor, we must recollect that there is a difference between the\r\n'absolute depth' (that is to say, the depth below the Earth's surface at\r\nthat point) and the 'relative depth' (or that beneath the level of the sea).\r\n The greatest relative depth that man has hitherto reached is probably the\r\nbore at the new salt-works at Minden, in Prussia:  in June, 1814, it was\r\nexactly 1993 feet, the absolute depth being 2231 feet.  The temperature of\r\nthe water at the bottom was 98 degrees F., which assuming the mean\r\ntemperature of the air at 49.3 degrees gives an augmentation of temperature\r\nof 1 degree for every 54 feet.  The absolute depth of the Artesian well of\r\nGrenelle, near Paris, is only 1795 feet.  According to the account of the\r\nmissionary Imbert, the fire-springs, \"Ho-tsing.\" of the Chinese, which are\r\nsunk to obtain [carbureted] hydrogen gas for salt-boiling, far exceed our\r\nArtesian springs in depth.  In the Chinese province of Szu-tschuan these\r\nfire-springs are very commonly of the depth of more than 2000 feet; indeed,\r\nat Tseu-lieu-tsing (the place of continual flow) there is a Ho-tsing which,\r\nin the year 1812, was found to be 3197 feet deep.  (Humboldt, 'Asie\r\nCentrale', t. ii., p. 521 and 525.  'Annales de l'Association de la\r\nPropagation de la Foi', 1829, No. 16, p. 369.)\r\n\r\n[footnote continues] The relative depth reached at Mount Massi, in Tuscany,\r\nsouth of Volterra, amounts, according to Matteuci, to only 1253 feet.  The\r\nboring at the new salt-works near Minden is probably of about the same\r\nrelative depth as the coal-mine at Apendale, near Newcastle-under-Lyme, in\r\nStaffordshire, where men work 725 yards below the surface of the earth.\r\n(Thomas Smith, 'Miner's Guide', 1836, p. 160.)  Unfortunately, I do not know\r\nthe exact height of its mouth above the level of the sea.  The relative\r\ndepth of the Monk-wearmouth mine, near Newcastle, is only 1496 feet.\r\n(Phillips, in the 'Philos. Mag.', vol. v., 1834, p. 446.)  That of the Liege\r\ncoal-mine, 'l'Esperance' at Seraing, is, according to M. Gernaert, Ingenieur\r\ndes Mines, 1223 feet in depth.  The works of greatest absolute depth that\r\nhave ever been formed are for the most part situated in such elevated plains\r\nor valleys that they either do not descend so low as the level of the sea,\r\nor at most reach very little below it.  Thus the Eselchacht, at Kuttenberg,\r\nin Bohemia, a mine which can not now be worked, had the enormous absolute\r\ndepth of 3778 feet.  (Fr. A. Schmidt, 'Berggestze der oter Mon.', abth. i.,\r\nbd. i., s. xxxii.)  Also, at St. Daniel and at Geish, on the Rorerbubel, in\r\nthe 'Landgericht' (or provincial district) of Kitzbuhl, there were, in the\r\nsixteenth century, excavations of 3107 feet.  The plans of the works of the\r\nRorerbubel are still preserved.  (See Joseph von Sperges, 'Tyroler\r\nBergwerksgeschichte', s. 121.  Compare, also, Humboldt, 'Gutachten uber\r\n√∫erantreibung des Meissner Stollens in die Freiberger Erzrevier', printed\r\nin Herder, 'uber Herantreibung des Meissner Stollens in die Freiberger\r\nErzrevier', printed in Herder, 'uber den jetz begonnenen Erbstollen', 1838,\r\ns. cxxiv.)  We may presume that the knowledge of the extraordinary depth of\r\nthe Rorerbuhel reached England at an early period, for I find it remarked in\r\nGilbert, 'de Magnete', that men have penetrated 2400 or even 3000 feet into\r\nthe crust of the Earth.  (\"Exigua videtur terrae portio, quae unquam\r\nhominibus spectanda emerget aut eruitur; cum profundinus in ejus viscera,\r\nultra efflorescentis extremitatis corruptelam, aut propter aquas in magnis\r\nfodin, tanquam per venas scaturientesaut propter seris salubrioris ad vitam\r\noperariorum sustinendam necessarii defectum, aut propter ingentex sumptus ad\r\ntantos labores exantlandos, multasque difficultates, ad profundiores terrz'\r\npartes penetrre non possumus; adeo ut quadrigentas aut [quod rarissime]\r\nquingentas orgyas in quibusdam metallis descendisse, stupendus omnibus\r\nvideatur connatus.\" -- Guilielmi Gilberti, Colcestrensis, 'de Magnete\r\nPhysiologia nova'.  Lond., 1600, p. 40.)\r\n\r\n[footnote continues]  The absolute depth of the mines in the Saxon\r\nErzgebirge, near Freiburg, are:  in the Thurmhofer mines, 1944 feet; in the\r\nHonenbirker mines, 1827 feet; the relative depths are only 677 and 277 feet,\r\nif, in order to calculate the elevation of the mine's mouth above the level\r\nof the sea, we regard the elevation of Freiburg as determined by Reich's\r\nrecent observations to be 1269 feet.  The absolute depth of the celebrated\r\nmine of Joachimsthal, in Bohemia (Verkreuzung des Jung Hauer Zechen-und\r\nAndreasganges), is full 2120 feet; so that, as Von Dechen's measurements\r\nshow that its surface is about 2388 feet above the level of the sea, it\r\nfollows that the excavations have not as yet reached that point.  In the\r\nHarz, the Samson mine at Andreasberg has an absolute depth of 2197 feet.  In\r\nwhat was formerly Spanish America, I know of no mine deeper than the\r\nValenciana, near Guanaxuato (Mexico), where I found the absolute depth of\r\nthe Planes de San Bernardo to be 1686 feet; but these planes are 5960 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.  If we compare the depth of the old Kuttenberger\r\nmine (a depth greater than the height of our Brocken, and only 200 feet less\r\nthan that of Vesuvius) with the loftiest structures that the hands of man\r\nhave erected (with the Pyramid of Cheops and with the Cathedral of\r\nStrasburg), we find that they stand in the ratio of eight to one.  In this\r\nnote I have collected all the certain information I could find regarding the\r\ngreatest absolute and relative depths of mines and borings.  In descending\r\neastward from Jerusalem toward the Dead Sea, a view presents itself to the\r\neye, which, according to our present hypsometrical knowledge of the surface\r\nof our planet, is unrivaled in any country; as we approach the open ravine\r\nthrough which the Jordan takes its course, we tread, with the open sky above\r\nus, on rocks which, according to the barometric measurements of Berton and\r\nRussegger are 1385 feet below the level of the Mediterranean.  (Humboldt,\r\n'Asie Centrale', th. ii., p. 323.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crystalline masses that have been erupted from active volcanoes, and are\r\ngenerally similar to the rocks on the upper surface, have come from depths\r\nwhich, although not accurately determined, must certainly be sixty times\r\ngreater than those to which human labor has been enabled to penetrate.  We\r\nare able to give in numbers the depth of the shaft where the strata of coal,\r\nafter penetrating a certain way, rise again at a distance that admits of\r\nbeing accurately defined by measurements.  These dips show that the\r\ncarboniferous strata, together with the fossil organic remains which they\r\ncontain, must lie, as, for instance, in Belgium, more than five or six\r\nthousand feet* below the present level\r\np 160\r\nof the sea, and that the calcareous and the curved strata of the Devonian\r\nbasin penetrate twice that depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Basin-shaped curved strata, which dip and reappear at\r\nmeasureable distances, although their deepest portions are beyond the reach\r\nof the miner, afford sensible evidence of the nature of the earth's crust at\r\ngreat depths below its surface.  Testimony of this kind possesses,\r\nconsequently, a great geognostic interest.  I am indebted to that excellent\r\ngeognosist, Von Dechen, for the following observations.  \"The depth of the\r\ncoal basin of Liege, at Mont St. Gilles, which I, in conjunction with our\r\nfriend Von Oeynhausen, have ascertained to be 3890 feet below the surface,\r\nextends 3464 feet below the surface of the sea, for the absolute height of\r\nMont St. Gilles certainly does not much exceed 400 feet; the coal basin of\r\nMons is fully 1865 feet deeper.  But all these depths are trifling compared\r\nwith those which are presented by the coal strata of Saar-Revier\r\n(Saarbrucken).  I have found after repeated examinations, that the lowest\r\ncoal stratum which is known in the neighborhood of Duttweiler, near\r\nBettingen, northeast of Saarlouis, must descend to depths of 20,682 and\r\n22,015 feet (or 3.6 geographical miles) below the level of the sea.\"  This\r\nresult exceeds, by more than 8000 feet, the assumption made in the text\r\nregarding the basin of the Devonian strata.  This coal-field is therefore\r\nsunk as far below the surface of the sea as Chimborazo is elevated above it\r\n-- at a depth at which the Earth's temperature must be as high as\r\n435ºdegrees F.  Hence, from the highest pinnacles of the Himalaya to the\r\nlowest basins containing the vegetation of an earlier world, there is a\r\nvertical distance of about 48,000 feet, or of the 435th part of the Earth's\r\nradius.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we compare these subterranean basins with the summits of montains that\r\nhave hitherto been considered as the most elevated portions of the raised\r\ncrust of the Earth, we obtain a distance of 37,000 feet (about seven miles),\r\nthat is, about the 1/524th of the Earth's radius.  These, therefore, would\r\nbe the limits of vertical depth and of the superposition of mineral strata\r\nto which geognostical inquiry could penetrate, even if the general elevation\r\nof the upper surface of the earth were equal to the height of the\r\nDhawalagigi in the Himalaya, or of the Sorata in Bolivia.  All that lies at\r\na greater depth below the level of the sea than the shafts or the basins of\r\nwhich I have spoken, the limits to which man's labors have penetrated, or\r\nthan the depths to which the sea has in some few instances been sounded (Sir\r\nJames Ross was unable to find bottom with 27,600 feet of line), is as much\r\nunknown to us as the interior of the other planets of our solar system.  We\r\nonly know the mass of the whole Earth and its mean density by comparing it\r\nwith the open strata, which alone are accessible to us.  In the interior of\r\nthe Earth, where all knowledge of its chemical and mineralogical character\r\nfails, we are again limited to as pure conjecture, as in the remotest bodies\r\nthat revolve round the Sun.  We can determine nothing with certainty\r\nregarding the depth at which the geological strata must be supposed to be in\r\nstate of softening or of liquid fusion, of the cavities occupied by elastic\r\nvapor, of the condition of fluids when heated under an enormous pressure, or\r\nof the law of the increase\r\np 161\r\nof density from the upper surface to the center of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the increase of heat with the increase of depth toward\r\nthe interior of our planet, and of the reaction of the interior on the\r\nexternal crust, leads us to the long series of volcanic phenomena.  These\r\nelastic forces are manifested in earthquakes, eruptions of gas, hot wells,\r\nmud volcanoes and lava currents from craters of eruption and even in\r\nproducing alterations in the level of the sea.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * [See Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', 2d edit., 3848, p. 539, etc., on\r\nthe so called 'mud volcanoes', and the reasons advanced in favor of adopting\r\nthe term \"salses\" to designate these phenomena.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge plains and variously indented continents are raised or sunk, lands are\r\nseparated from seas, and the ocean itself, which is permeated by hot and\r\ncold currents, coagulates at both poles, converting water into dense masses\r\nof rock, which are either stratified and fixed, or broken up into floating\r\nbanks.  The boundaries of sea and land, of fluids and solids, are thus\r\nvariously and frequently changed.  Plains have undergone oscillatory\r\nmovements, being alternately elevated and depressed.  After the elevation of\r\ncontinents, mountain chains were raised upon long fissures, mostly parallel,\r\nand in that case, probably cotemporaneous; and salt lakes and inland seas,\r\nlong inhabited by the same creatures, were forcibly separated, the fossil\r\nremains of shells and zoophytes still giving evidence of their original\r\nconnection.  Thus, in following phenomena in their mutual dependence, we are\r\nled from the consideration of the forces acting in the interior of the Earth\r\nto those which cause eruptions on its surface, and by the pressure of\r\nelastic vapors give rise to burning streams of lava that flow from open\r\nfissures.\r\n\r\nThe same powers that raised the chains of the Andes and the Hiimalaya to the\r\nregions of perpetual snow, have occasioned new compositions and new textures\r\nin the rocky masses, and have altered the strata which had been previously\r\ndeposited from fluids impregnated with organic substances.  We here trace\r\nthe series of formations, divided and superposed according to their age, and\r\ndepending upon the changes of configuration of the surface, the dynamic\r\nrelations of upheaving forces, and the chemical action of vapors issuing\r\nfrom the fissures.\r\n\r\nThe form and distribution of continents, that is to say, of that solid\r\nportion of the Earth's surface which is suited to the luxurious development\r\nof vegetable life, are associated by intimate connection and reciprocal\r\naction with the encircling\r\np 162\r\nsea in which organic life is almost entirely limited to the animal world.\r\nThe liquid element is again covered by the atmosphere, an aërial ocean in\r\nwhich the mountain chains and high plains of the dry land rise like shoals,\r\noccasioning a variety of currents and changes of temperature, collecting\r\nvapor from the region of clouds, and distributing life and motion by the\r\naction of the streams of water which flow from their declivities.\r\n\r\nWhile the geography of plants and animals depends on these intricate\r\nrelations of the distribution of sea and land, the configuration of the\r\nsurface, and the direction of isothermal lines (or zones of equal mean\r\nannual heat), we find that the case is totally different when we consider\r\nthe human race -- the last and noblest subject in a physical description of\r\nthe globe.  The characteristic differences in races, and their relative\r\nnumerical distribution over the Earth's surface, are conditions affected not\r\nby natural relations alone, but at the same time and specially, by the\r\nprogress of civilization, and by moral and intellectual cultivation on which\r\ndepends the political superiority that distinguishes national progress.\r\nSome few races, clinging, as it were, to the soil, are supplanted and ruined\r\nby the dangerous vicinity of others more civilized than themselves, until\r\nscarce a trace of their existence remains.  Other races, again, not the\r\nstrongest in numbers, traverse the liquid element, and thus become the first\r\nto acquire, although late, a geographical knowledge of at least the maritime\r\nlands of the whole surface of our globe, from pole to pole.\r\n\r\nI have thus, before we enter on the individual characters of that portion of\r\nthe delineation of nature which includes the sphere of telluric phenomena,\r\nshown generally in what manner the consideration of the form of the Earth\r\nand the incessant action of electro-magnetism and subterranean heat may\r\nenable us to embrace in one view the relations of horizontal expansion and\r\nelevation on the Earth's surface, the geognostic type of formations, the\r\ndomain of the ocean (of the liquid portions of the Earth), the atmosphere\r\nwith its meteorological processes, the geographical distribution of plants\r\nand animals, and, finally, the physical gradations of the human race, which\r\nis, exclusively and every where, susceptible of intellectual culture.  This\r\nunity of contemplation presupposes a connection of phenomena according to\r\ntheir internal combination.  A mere tabular arrangement of these facts would\r\nnot fulfill the object I have proposed to myself, and would not satisfy that\r\nrequirement for cosmical presentation awakened in me by the\r\np 163\r\naspect of nature in my journeyings by sea and land, by the careful study of\r\nforms and forces, and by a vivid impression of the unity of nature in the\r\nmidst of the most varied portions of the Earth.  In the rapid advance of all\r\nbranches of physical science, much that is deficient in this attempt will,\r\nperhaps, at no remote period, be corrected and rendered more perfect, for it\r\nbelongs to the history of the development of knowledge that portions which\r\nhave long stood isolated become gradually connected, and subject to higher\r\nlaws.  I only indicate the empirical path in which I and many others of\r\nsimilar pursuits with myself are advancing, full of expectation that, as\r\nPlato tells us Socrates once desired, \"Nature may be interpreted by reason\r\nalone.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Plato, 'Phaedo', p. 97.  (Arist., 'Metaph.', p. 985.)  compare\r\nHegel, 'Philosophie der Geschichte', 1840, s. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe delineation of the principal characteristics of telluric phenomena must\r\nbegin with the form of our planet and its relations in space.  Here too, we\r\nmay say that it is not only the mineralogical character of rocks, whether\r\nthey are crystalline, granular, or densely fossiliferous, but the\r\ngeometrical form of the Earth itself, which indicates the mode of its\r\norigin, and is, in fact, its history.  An elliptical spheroid of revolution\r\ngives evidence of having once been a soft or fluid mass.  Thus the Earth's\r\ncompression constitutes one of the most ancient geognostic events, as every\r\nattentive reader of the book of nature can easily discern; and an analogous\r\nfact is presented in the case of the Moon, the perpetual direction of whose\r\naxes toward the Earth, that is to say, the increased accumulation of matter\r\non that half of the Moon which is turned toward us, determines the relations\r\nof the periods of rotation and revolution, and is probably contemporaneous\r\nwith the earliest epoch in the formative history of this satellite.  The\r\nmathematical figure of the Earth is that which it would have were its\r\nsurface covered entirely by water in a state of rest; and it is this assumed\r\nform to which all geodesical measurements of degrees refer.  This\r\nmathematical surface is different from that true physical surface which is\r\naffected by all the accidents and inequalities of the solid parts.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bessel, 'Allgemeine Betrachtungen uber Gradmessungen nach\r\nastronomisch-geodätischen Arbeiten', at the conclusion of Bessel and\r\nBaeyer, 'Gradmessung in Ostpreussen', s. 427.

Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest., Praef., c. ii. \"El\r\nmundo espoco\" (the Earth is small and narrow), writes Columbus from Jamaica\r\nto Queen Isabella on the 7th of July, 1503:  not because he entertained the\r\nphilosophic views of the aforesaid Romans, but because it appeared\r\nadvantageous to him to maintain that the journey from Spain was not long,\r\nif, as he observes, \"we seek the east from the west.\"  Compare my 'Examen\r\nCrit. de l'Hist. de la Geogr. du 15 me Siecle', t.i., p. 83, and t. ii., p.\r\n327, where I have shown that the opinion maintained by Delisle, Freret, and\r\nGosselin, that the excessive differences in the statements regarding the\r\nEarth's circumference, found in the writings of the Greeks, are only\r\napparent, and dependent on different values being attached to the stadia,\r\nwas put forward as early as 1495 by Jaime Ferrer, in a proposition regarding\r\nthe determination of the line of demarkation of the papal dominions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf these measurements do not always accord in the curvatures of different\r\nmeridians under the same degree of latitude, this very circumstance speaks\r\nin favor of the exactness of the instruments and the methods employed, and\r\nof the accuracy and the fidelity to nature of these partial results.  The\r\nconclusion to be drawn from the increase of forces of attraction (in the\r\ndirection from the equator to the poles) with respect to the figure of a\r\nplanet is dependent on the distribution of density in its interior.  Newton,\r\nfrom theoretical principles, and perhaps likewise  prompted by Cassini's\r\ndiscovery, previously to 1666, of the compression of Jupiter,* determined,\r\nin his immortal work, 'Philosophiae Naturalis Principia', that the\r\ncompression of the Earth, as a homogeneous mass, was 1/230th.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Brewster, 'Life of Sir Isaac Newton', 1831, p. 162.  \"The\r\ndiscovery of the spheroidal form of Jupiter by Cassini had probably directed\r\nthe attention of Newton to the determination of its cause, and consequently,\r\nto the investigation of the true figure of the Earth.\"  Although Cassini did\r\nnot announce the amount of the compression of Jupiter (1/15th) till 1691\r\n('Anciens Memoires de l'Acad. des Sciences', t. ii., p. 108), yet we know\r\nfrom Lalande ('Astron.', 3me ed., t. iii., p. 335) that Moraldi possessed\r\nsome printed sheets of a Latin work, \"On the Spots of the Planets,\"\r\ncommenced by Cassini, from which it was obvious that he was aware of the\r\ncompression of Jupiter before the year 1666, and therefore at least\r\ntwenty-one years before the publication of Newton's 'Principia'.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual mesurements,\r\np 165\r\nmade by the aid of new and more perfect analysis, have, however, shown that\r\nthe compression of the poles of the terrestrial spheroid, when the density\r\nof the strata is regarded as increasing toward the center, is very nearly\r\n1/300th.\r\n\r\nThree methods have been employed to investigate the curvature of the Earth's\r\nsurface, viz., measurements of degrees, oscillations of the pendulum, and\r\nobservations of the inequalities in the Moon's orbit.  The first is a direct\r\ngeometrical and astronomical method, while in the other two we determine\r\nfrom accurately observed movements the amount of  the forces which occasion\r\nthose movements, and from these forces we arrive at the cause from whence\r\nthey have originated, viz., the compression of our terrestrial spheroid.  In\r\nthis part of my delineation of nature, contrary to my usual practice, I have\r\ninstanced methods because their accuracy affords a striking illustration of\r\nthe intimate connection existing among the forms and forces of natural\r\nphenomena, and also because their application has given occasion to\r\nimprovements in the exactness of instruments (as those employed in the\r\nmeasurements of space) in optical and chronological observations; to greater\r\nperfection in the fundamental branches of astronomy and mechanics in respect\r\nto lunar motion and to the resistance experienced by the oscillations of the\r\npendulum; and to the discovery of new and hitherto untrodden paths of\r\nanalysis.  With the exception of the investigations of the parallax of\r\nstars, which led to the discovery of aberration and nutation, the history of\r\nscience presents no problem in which the object attained -- the knowledge of\r\nthe compression and of the irregular form of our planet -- is so far\r\nexceeded in importance by the incidental gain which has accrued, through a\r\nlong and weary course of investigation, in the general furtherance and\r\nimprovement of the mathematical and astronomical sciences.  The comparison\r\nof eleven measurements of degrees (in which are included three\r\nextra-European, namely, the old Peruvian and two East Indian) gives,\r\naccording to the most strictly theoretical requirements allowed for by\r\nBessel,* a compression\r\np 166\r\nof 1/299th.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *According to Bessel's examination of ten measurements of\r\ndegrees, in which the error discovered by Poissant in the calculation of the\r\nFrench measurements is taken into consideration (Schumacher, 'Astron.\r\nNachr.', 1841, No. 438, s. 116), the semi-axis major of the elliptical\r\nspheroid of revolution to which the irregular figure of the Earth most\r\nclosely approximates is 3,272,077.14 toises, or 20,924,774 feet; the\r\nsemi-axis minor, 3,261,159,83 toises, or 20,854,821 feet; and the amount of\r\ncompression or eccentricity 1/299.152d; the length of a mean degree of the\r\nmeridian, 57,013.109 toises, or 364,596 feet, with an error of + 2.8403\r\ntoises, or 18.16 feet, whence the length of a geographical mile is 3807.23\r\ntoises, or 6086.7 feet.  Previous combinations of measurements of degrees\r\nvaried between 1/302d and 1/297th; thus Walbeck ('De Forma of Magnitudine\r\ntelluris in demensis arcubus Meridiani definiendis', 1819) gives 1/30278th:\r\nEd. Schmidt ('Lehrbuch der Mathem. und Phys. Geographie', 1829, s. 5) gives\r\n1/20742d, as the mean of seven measures.  Respecting the influence of great\r\ndifferences of longitude on the polar compression, see 'Bibliotheque\r\nUniverselle', t. xxxiii., p. 181, and t. xxxv., p. 50: likewise\r\n'Connaissance des Tems', 1829, p. 290.  From the lunar inequalities alone,\r\nLaplace ('Exposition du Syst. du Monde', p. 229) found it, by the older\r\ntables of Burg, to be 1/3245th; and subsequently, from the lunar\r\nobservations of Burckhardt and Bouvard, he fixed it at 1/299.1th ('Mecanique\r\nCeleste', t. v., p. 13 and 43).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this, the polar radius is 10,938 toises (69,944 feet), or\r\nabout 11 1/2 miles, shorter than the equatorial radius of our terrestrial\r\nspheroid.  The excess at the equator in consequence of the curvature of the\r\nupper surface of the globe amounts, consequently, in the direction of\r\ngravitation, to somewhat more than 4 3/7th times the height of Mont Blanc,\r\nor only 2 1/2 times the probable height of the summit of the Chawalagiri, in\r\nthe Himalaya chain.  The lunar inequalities (perturbation in the moon's\r\nlatitude and longitude) give according to the last investigations of\r\nLaplace, almost the same result for the ellipticity as the measurements of\r\ndegrees, viz., 1/299th.  The results yielded by the oscillation of the\r\npendulum give, on the whole, a much greater amount of compression, viz.,\r\n1/288th.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The oscillations of the pendulum give 1/288.7th as the general\r\nresult of Sabine's great expedition (1822 and 1823, from the equator to 80\r\ndegrees north latitude); according to Freycinet, 1/286.2d, exclusive of the\r\nexperiments instituted at the Isle of France, Guam, and Mowi (Mawi);\r\naccording to Forster, 1/289.5th; according to Duperrey, 1/266.4th; and\r\naccording to Lutke ('Partie Nautique', 1836, p. 232), 1/270th, calculated\r\nfrom eleven stations.  On the other hand, Mathieu ('Connais. des Temps',\r\n1816, p. 330) fixed the amount at 1/298.2d, from observations made between\r\nFormentera and Dunkirk; and Biot, at 1/304th, from observations between\r\nFormentera and the island of Ust.  Compare Baily, 'Report on Pendulum\r\nExperiments', in the 'Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society', vol. vii.,\r\np. 96; also Borenius, in the 'Bulletin de l'Acad. de St. Petersbourg', 1843,\r\nt. i., p. 25.  The first proposal to apply the length of the pendulum as a\r\nstandard of measure, and to establish the third part of the seconds pendulum\r\n(then supposed to be every where of equal length) as a 'pes horarius', or\r\ngeneral measure, that might be recovered at any age and by all nations, is\r\nto be found in Huygens's 'Horologium Oscillatorium', 1673, Prop. 25.  A\r\nsimilar wish was afterward publicly expressed, in 1742, on a monument\r\nerected at the equator by Bouguer, La Condamine, and Godin.  On the\r\nbeautiful marble tablet which exists, as yet uninjured, in the old Jesuits'\r\nCollege at Quito, I have myself read the inscription, 'Penduli simplicis\r\naequinoctialis unius minuti secundi archetypus, mensurae naturalis exemplar,\r\nutinam universalis!'  From an observation made by La Condamine, in his\r\n'Journal du Voyage a l'Equateur', 1751, p. 163, regarding parts of the\r\ninscription that were not filled up, and a slight difference between Bonguer\r\nand himself respecting the numbers, I was led to expect that I should find\r\nconsiderable discrepancies between the marble tablet and the inscription as\r\nit had been described in Paris; but, after a careful comparison, I merely\r\nfound two \"ex arca graduum plusquam trium,\" and the date of 1745 instead of\r\n1742.  The latter circumstance is singular, because La Condamine returned to\r\nEurope in November, 1744, Bouguer in June of the same year, and Godin had\r\nleft South America in July, 1744.  The most necessary and useful amendment\r\nto the numbers on this inscription would have been the astronomical\r\nlongitude of Quito.  (Humboldt, 'Recueil d'Observ. Astron.', t. ii., p.\r\n319-354.)  Nouet's latitudes, engraved on Egyptian monuments, offer a more\r\nrecent example of the danger presented by the grave perpetuation of false or\r\ncareless results.\r\n\r\n\r\nGalileo, who first observed when a boy (having, probably, suffered his\r\nthoughts to wander from the service) that the height of the vaulted roof of\r\na church might be measured by the time of the vibration of the chandeliers\r\nsuspended at different altitudes, could hardly have anticipated that the\r\npendulum would one day be carried from pole to pole, in order to determine\r\nthe form of the Earth, or, rather, that the unequal density of the strata of\r\nthe Earth affects the length of the seconds pendulum by means of intricate\r\nforces of local attraction, which are, however, almost regular in large\r\ntracts of land.  These geognostic relations of an instrument intended for\r\nthe measurement of time -- this property of the pendulum, by which, like a\r\nsounding line, it searches unknown depths, and reveals in volcanic islands,*\r\nor in the declivity of elevated continental mountain chains,** dense masses\r\nof basalt and melaphyre instead of cavities, render it difficult,\r\nnotwithstanding the admirable simplicity of the method, to arrive at any\r\ngreat result regarding the figure of the Earth from observation of the\r\noscillations of the pendulum.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Respecting the augmented intensity of the attraction of\r\ngravitation in volcanic islands (St. Helena, Ualan, Fernando de Noronha,\r\nIsle of France, Guam, Mowe, and Galapagos), Rawak (Lutke, p. 240) being an\r\nexception, probably in consequence of its proximity to the highland of New\r\nGuinea, see Mathieu, in Delambre, 'Hist. de l'Astronomie, au 18me Siecle',\r\np. 701.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **Numerous observations also show great irregularities in the\r\nlength of the pendulum in the midst of continents, and which are ascribed to\r\nlocal attractions.  (Delambre, 'Mesure de la Meridienne', t. iii., p. 548;\r\nBiot, in the 'Mem. de l'Academie des Sciences', t. viii., 1829, p. 18 and\r\n23.)  In passing over the South of France and Lombardy from west to east, we\r\nfind the minimum intensity of gravitation at Bordeaux; from thence it\r\nincreases rapidly as we advance eastward, through Figeac, Clermont-Ferrand,\r\nMilan, and Padua; and in the last town we find that the intensity has\r\nattained its maximum.  The influence of the southern declivities of the Alps\r\nis not merely t on the general size of their mass, but (much more), in the\r\nopinion of Elie de Beaumont ('Rech. sur les Revol. de la Surface du Globe',\r\n1830, p. 729), on the rocks of melaphyre and serpentine, which have elevated\r\nthe chain.  On the declivity of Ararat, which with Caucasus may be said to\r\nlie in the center of gravity of the old continent formed by Europe, Asia,\r\nand Africa, the very exact pendulum experiments of Fedorow give indications,\r\nnot of subterranean cavities, but of dense volcanic masses.  (Parrot, 'Reise\r\nzum Ararat', bd. ii., s. 143.)  In the geodesic operations of Carlini and\r\nPlana, in Lombardy, differences ranging from 20\" to 47\".8 have been found\r\nbetween direct observations of latitude and the results of these operations.\r\n (See the instances of Andrate and Mondovi, and those of Milan and Padua, in\r\nthe 'Operations Geodes. et Astron. pour la Mesure d'un Arc du Parallele\r\nMoyen', t. ii., p. 347; 'Effemeridi Astron. di Milano', 1842, p. 57.)  The\r\nlatitude of Milan, deduced from that of Berne, according to the  , is\r\n45ºdegrees 27' 52\", while, according to direct astronomical observations,\r\nit is 45 degrees 27' 35\".  As the perturbations extend in the plain of\r\nLombardy to Parma, which is far south of the Po (Plana, 'Operat. Geod.', t.\r\nii., p. 847), it is probable that there are deflecting causes 'concealed\r\nbeneath the soil of the plain itself'.  Struve has made similar experiments\r\n[with corresponding results] in the most level parts of eastern Europe.\r\n(Schumacher, 'Astron. Nachrichten', 1830, No. 164, s. 399.)  Regarding the\r\ninfluence of dense masses supposed to lie at a small depth, equal to the\r\nmean height of the Alps, see the analytical expressions given by Hossard and\r\nRozet, in the 'Comptes Rendus', t. xviii., 1844, p. 292, and compare them\r\nwith Poisson, 'Traite de Mecanique' (2me ed., t. i., p. 482.  The earliest\r\nobservations on the influence which different kinds of rocks exercise on the\r\nvibration of the pendulum are those of Thomas Young, in the 'Philos.\r\nTransactions' for 1819, p. 70-96.  In drawing conclusions regarding the\r\nEarth's curvature from the length of the pendulum, we ought not to overlook\r\nthe possibility that its crust may have undergone a process of hardening\r\npreviously to metallic and dense basaltic masses having penetrated from\r\ngreat depths, through open clefts, and approached near the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the astronomical part of the determination of degrees of latitude,\r\nmountain chains, or the denser strata of the Earth, likewise exercise,\r\nalthough in a less degree, an unfavorable influence on the measurement.\r\n\r\nAs the form of the Earth exerts a powerful influence on the motions of other\r\ncosmical bodies, and especially on that of its own neighboring satellite, a\r\nmore perfect knowledge of the motion of the latter will enable us\r\nreciprocally to draw an inference regarding the figure of the Earth.  Thus,\r\nas Laplace ably remarks,*  \"An astronomer, without leaving his observatory,\r\nmay, by a comparison of lunar theory with true observations, not only be\r\nenabled to determine the form and size of the Earth, but also its distance\r\nfrom the Sun and Moon -- results that otherwise could only be arrived at by\r\nlong and arduous expeditions to the most remote parts of both hemispheres.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Expos. du Syst. du Monde', p. 231.\r\n\r\n\r\np 169\r\nThe compression which may be inferred from lunar inequalities affords an\r\nadvantage not yielded by individual measurements of degrees or experiments\r\nwith the pendulum, since it gives a mean amount which is referable to the\r\nwhole planet.  The comparison of the Earth's compression with the velocity\r\nof rotation shows, further, the increase of density from the strata from the\r\nsurface toward the center -- an increase which a comparison of the ratios of\r\nthe axes of Jupiter and Saturn with their times of rotation likewise shows\r\nto exist in these two large planets.  Thus the knowledge of the external\r\nform of planetary bodies leads us to draw conclusions regarding their\r\ninternal character.\r\n\r\nThe northern and southern hemispheres appear to present nearly the same\r\ncurvature under equal degrees of latitude, but, as has already been\r\nobserved, pendulum experiments and measurements of degrees yield such\r\ndifferent results for individual portions of the Earth's surface that no\r\nregular figure can be given which would reconcile all the results hitherto\r\nobtained by this method.  the true figure of the Earth is to a regular\r\nfigure as the uneven surfaces of water in motion are on the even surface of\r\nwater at rest.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earth had been measured, it still had to be weighed.  The\r\noscillations of the pendulum* and the plummet have here likewise served to\r\ndetermine the mean density of the Earth, either in connection with\r\nastronomical and geodetic operations, with the view of finding the\r\ndeflection of the plummet from a vertical line in the vicinity of a\r\nmountain, or by a comparison of the length of the pendulum in a plain and on\r\nthe summit of an elevation, or, finally, by the employment of a torsion\r\nbalance, which may be considered as a horizontally vibrating pendulum for\r\nthe measurement of the relative density of neighbouring strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *La Caille's pendulum measurements at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwhich have been calculated with much care by Mathieu (Delambre, 'Hist. de\r\nl'Astron. au 18me Siecle', p. 479), give a compression of 1/284.4th; but,\r\nfrom several comparisons of observations  made in equal latitudes in the two\r\nhemispheres (New Holland and the Malouines (Falkland Islands), compared with\r\nBarcelona, New York, and Dunkirk), there is as yet no reason for supposing\r\nthat the mean compression of the southern hemisphere is greater than that of\r\nthe northern.  (Biot, in the 'Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences', t. viii., 1829,\r\np. 39-41.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf these three methods* the\r\np 170\r\nlast is the most certain, since it is independent of the difficult\r\ndetermination of the density of the mineral masses of which the spherical\r\nsegment of the mountain consists near which the observations are made.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The three methods of observation give the following results:\r\n(1.) by the deflection of the plumb-line in the proximity of the Shehallien\r\nMountain (Gaelic, Thichallin) in Perthshire, r.713, as determined by\r\nMaskelyne, Hutton, and Playfair (1774-1776 and 1810), according to a method\r\nthat had been proposed by Newton; (2.) by pendulum vibrations on mountains,\r\n4.837 (Carlini's observations on Mount Cenis compared with Biot's\r\nobservations at Bordeaux, 'Effemer. Astron. di Milano', 1824, p. 184); (3.)\r\nby the torsion balance used by Cavendish, with an apparatus originally\r\ndevised by Mitchell, 5.48 (according to Hutton's revision of the\r\ncalculation, 5.32, and according to that of Eduard Schmidt, 5.52; 'Lehrbuch\r\nder Math. Geographie', bd. i., s. 487); by the torsion balance, according to\r\nReich, 5.44.  In the calculation of these experiments of Professor Reich,\r\nwhich have been made with masterly accuracy, the original mean result was\r\n5.43 (with a probable error of only 0.0233), a result which, being increased\r\nby the quantity by which the Earth's centrifugal force diminishes the force\r\nof gravity for the latitude of Freiberg (50 degrees 55'), becomes changed to\r\n5.44.  The employment of cast iron instead of lead has not presented any\r\nsensible difference, or none exceeding the limits of errors of observation,\r\nhence disclosing no traces of magnetic influences.  (Reich, 'Vrsuche uber\r\ndie mittlere Dichtigheit der Erde', 1838, s. 60, 62, and 66.)  By the\r\nassumption of too slight a degree of ellipticity of the Earth, and by the\r\nuncertainty of the estimations regarding the density of rocks on its\r\nsurface, the mean density of the Earth, as deduced from experiments on and\r\nnear mountains, was found about one sixth smaller than it really is, namely,\r\n4.761 (Laplace, 'Mecan. Celeste', t. v., p. 46), or 4.785.  (Eduard Schmidt,\r\n'Lehrb. der Math. Geogr.', bd. i., 387 und 418.)  On Halley's hypothesis of\r\nthe Earth being a hollow sphere (noticed in page 171), which was the germ of\r\nFranklin's ideas concerning earthquakes, see 'Philos. Trans.' for the year\r\n1693, vol. xvii., p. 563 ('On the Structure of the Internal Parts of the\r\nEarth, and the concave habited 'Arch of the Shell').  Halley regarded it as\r\nmore worthy of the Creator \"that the Earth, like a house of several stories,\r\nshould be inhabited both without and within.  For light in the hollow sphere\r\n(p. 576) provision might in some manner be contrived.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the most recent experiments of Reich, the result obtained is\r\n5.44; that is to say, the mean density of the whole Earth is 5.44 times\r\ngreater than tht of pure water.  As according to the nature of the\r\nmineralogical strata constituting the dry continental part of the Earth's\r\nsurface, the mean density of this portion scarcely amounts to 2.7, and the\r\ndensity of the dry and liquid surface conjointly to scarcely 1.6, it follows\r\nthat the elliptical unequally compressed layers of the interior must greatly\r\nincrease in density toward the center, either through pressure or owing to\r\nthe heterogeneous nature of the substances.  Here again we see that the\r\nvertical, as well as the horizontally vibrating pendulum, may justly be\r\ntermed a geognostical instrument.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by the employment of an instrument of this kind have\r\nled celebrated physicists, according to the difference of the hypothesis\r\nfrom which they started, to adopt\r\np 171\r\nentirely opposite views regarding the nature of the interior of the globe.\r\nIt has been computed at what depths liquid or even gaseous substances would,\r\nfrom the pressure of their own superimposed strata, attain a density\r\nexceeding that of platinum or even iridium; and in order that the\r\ncompression which has been detrmined within such narrow limits might be\r\nbrought into harmony with the assumption of simple and infinitely\r\ncompressible matter, Leslie has ingeniously conceived the nucleus of the\r\nworld to be a hollow sphere, filled with an assumed \"imponderable matter,\r\nhaving an enormous force of expansion.\"  These venturesome and arbitrary\r\nconjectures have given rise, in wholly unscientific circles, to still more\r\nfantastic notions.  The hollow sphere has by degrees been peopled with\r\nplants and animals, and two small subterranean revolving planets -- Pluto\r\nand Proserpine -- were imaginatively supposed to shed over it their mild\r\nlight; as, however, it was further imagined that an ever-uniform temperature\r\nreigned in these internal regions, the air, which was made self-luminous by\r\ncompression, might well render the planets of this lower world unnecessary.\r\nNear the north pole, at 80 degrees latitude, whence the polar light\r\nemanates, was an enormous opening, through which a descent might be made\r\ninto the hollow sphere, and Sir Humphrey Davy and myself were even publicly\r\nand frequently invited by Captain Symmes to enter upon this subterranean\r\nexpedition:  so powerful is the morbid inclination of men to fill unknown\r\nspaces with shapes of wonder, totally unmindful of the counter evidence\r\nfurnished by well-attested facts and universally acknowledged natural laws.\r\nEven the celebrated Halley, at the end of the seventeenth century, hollowed\r\nout the Earth in his magnetic speculations.  Men were invited to believe\r\nthat a subterranean freely-rotating nucleus occasions by its position the\r\ndiurnal and annual changes of magnetic declination.  It has thus been\r\nattempted in our own day, with tedious solemnity, to clothe in a scientific\r\ngarb the quaintly-devised fiction of the humorous Holbert.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[The work referred to, one of the wittiest productions of the\r\nlearned Norwegian satirist and dramatist Holberg, was written in Latin, and\r\nfirst appeared under the following title:  'Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum\r\nnovam telluris theoriam ac historiam quintae monarchi Nicolai Klimii iter\r\nsubterraneum novam telluris theoriam ac historiam quintae monarchi ad huc\r\nnobis incognitae exhibens e bibliotheca b. Abelini. Hafniae et Lipsiae sunt.\r\n Jac. Preuss', 1741.  An admirable Danish translation of this learned but\r\nsevere satire on the institutions, morals, and manners of the inhabitants of\r\nthe upper Earth, appeared at Copenhagen in 1789, and was entitled 'Niels\r\nKlim's underjordiske reise ocd Ludwig Holberg, oversal after den Latinske\r\noriginal of Jens Baggesen'.  Holberg, who studied for a time at Oxford, was\r\nborn at Bergen in 1685, and died in 1754 as Rector of the University of\r\nCopenhagen.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\np 172\r\nThe figure of the Earth and the amount of solidification (density) which it\r\nhas acquired are intimately connected with the forces by which it is\r\nanimated, in so far, at least, as they have been excited or awakened from\r\nwithout, through its planetry position with reference to a luminous central\r\nbody.  Compression, when considered as a consequence of centrifugal force\r\nacting on a rotating mass, explains the earlier condition of fluidity of our\r\nplanet.  During the solidification of this fluid, which is commonly\r\nconjectured to have been gaseous and primordially heated to a very high\r\ntemperature, an enormous quantity of latent heat must have been liberated.\r\nIf the process of solidification began as Fourier conjectures, by radiation\r\nfrom the cooling surface exposed to the atmosphere, the particles near the\r\ncenter would have continued fluid and hot.  As, after long emanation of heat\r\nfrom the center toward the exterior, a stable condition of the temperature\r\nof the Earth would at length be established, it has been assumed that with\r\nincreasing depth the subterranean heat likewise uninterruptedly increases.\r\nThe heat of the water which flows from deep borings (Artesian wells), direct\r\nexperiments regarding the temperature of rocks in mines, but, above all, the\r\nvolcanic activity of the Earth, shown by the flow of molten masses from open\r\nfissures, afford unquestionable evidence of this increase for very\r\nconsiderable depths from the upper strata.  According to conclusions based\r\ncertainly upon mere analogies, this increase is probably much greater toward\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nThat which has been learned by an ingenious analytic calculation, expressly\r\nperfected for this class of investigations,*\r\np 173\r\nregarding the motion of heat in homogeneous metallic spheroids, must be\r\napplied with much caution to the actual character of our planet, considering\r\nour present imperfect knowledge of the substances of which the Earth is\r\ncomposed, the difference in the capacity of heat and in the conducting power\r\nof different superimposed masses, and the chemical changes experienced by\r\nsolid and liquid masses from any enormous compression.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Here we must notice the admirable analytical labors of Fourier,\r\nBiot, Laplace, Poisson, Duhamel, and Lame.  In his 'Theorie Mathematique de\r\nla Chaleur', 1835, p. 3, 428-430, 436, and 521-524 (see, also, De la Rive's\r\nabstract in the 'Bibliotheque Universelle de Geneve', Poisson has developed\r\nan hypothesis totally different from Fourier's view ('Theorie Analytique de\r\nla Chaleur'.)  He denies the present fluid state of the Earth's center; he\r\nbelieves that \"in cooling by radiation to the medium surrounding the Earth,\r\nthe parts which were first solidified sunk, and that by a double descending\r\nand ascending current, the great inequality was lessened which would have\r\ntaken place in a solid body cooling from the surface.\"  It seems more\r\nprobable to this great geometer that the solidification began in the parts\r\nlying nearest to the center:  \"the phenomenon of the increase of heat with\r\nthe depth does not extend to the whole mass of the Earth, and is merely a\r\nconsequence of the motion of our planetary system in space, of which some\r\nparts are of a very different temperature from others, in consequence of\r\nstellar heat (chaleur stellaire).\"  Thus, according to Poisson, the warmth\r\nof the water of our Artesian wells is merely that which has penetrated into\r\nthe Earth from without; and the Earth itself \"might be regarded as in the\r\nsame circumstances as a mass of rock conveyed from the equator to the pole\r\nin so short a time as not to have entirely cooled.  The increase of\r\ntemperature in such a block would not extend to the central strata.\"  The\r\nphysical doubts which have reasonably been entertained against this\r\nextraordinary cosmical view (which attributes to the regions of space that\r\nwhich probably is more dependent on the first transition of matter\r\ncondensing from the gaseo-fluid into the solid state) will be found\r\ncollected in Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd. xxxix., s 93-100.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with the greatest difficulty that our powers of comprehension can\r\nconceive the boundary line which divides the fluid mass of the interior from\r\nthe hardened mineral masses of the external surface, or the gradual increase\r\nof the solid strata, and the condition of semi-fluidity of the earthy\r\nsubstances, these being conditions to which known laws of hydraulics can\r\nonly apply under considerable modifications.  The Sun and Moon, which cause\r\nthe sea to ebb and flow, most probably also affect these subterranean\r\ndepths.  We may suppose that the periodic elevations and depressions of the\r\nmolten mass under the already solidified strata must have caused\r\ninequalities in the vaulted surface from the force of pressure.  The amount\r\nand action of such oscillations must, however, be small; and if the relative\r\nposition of the attracting cosmical bodies may here also excite \"spring\r\ntides,\" it is certainly not to these, but to more powerful internal forces,\r\nthat we must ascribe the movements that shake the Earth's surface.  There\r\nare groups of phenomena to whose existence it is necessary to draw\r\nattention, in order to indicate the universality of the influence of the\r\nattraction of the Sun and Moon on the external and internal conditions of\r\nthe Earth, however little we may be able to determine the quantity of this\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nAccording to tolerably accordant experiments in Artesian wells, it has been\r\nshown that the heat increases on an average about 1 degree for every 54.5\r\nfeet.  If this increase can be reduced\r\np 174\r\nto arithmetical relations, it will follow, as I have already observed,* that\r\na stratum of granite would be in a state of fusion at a depth of nearly\r\ntwenty-one geographical miles, or between four and five times the elevation\r\nof the highest summit of the Hinalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the Introduction.  This increase of temperature has been\r\nfound in the Puits de Grenelle, at Paris, at 58.3 feet; in the boring at the\r\nnew salt-works at Minden, almost 53.6; at Pregny, near Geneva, according to\r\nAuguste de la Rive and Marcet, notwithstanding that the mouth of the boring\r\nis 1609 feet above the level of the sea, it is also 53.6 feet.  This\r\ncoincidence between the results of a method first proposed by Arago in the\r\nyear 1821 ('Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes', 1835, p. 234), for three\r\ndifferent mines, of the absolute depths of 1794, 2231, and 725 feet\r\nrespectively, is remarkable.  The two points on the Earth, lying at a small\r\nvertical distance from each other, whose annual mean temperatures are most\r\naccurately known, are probably at the spot on which the Paris Observatory\r\nstands, and the Caves de l'Observatoire beneath it; the mean temperature of\r\nthe former is 51.5ºdegrees, and of the latter 53.3ºdegrees, the difference\r\nbeing 1.8ºdegrees for 92 feet, or 1 degree for 51.77 feet.  (Poisson,\r\n'Theorie Math. de la Chaleur', p. 415 and 462.)  In the course of the last\r\nseventeen years, from causes not yet perfectly understood, but probably not\r\nconnected with the actual temperature of the caves, the thermometer standing\r\nthere has risen very nearly 0.4 degrees.  Although in Artesian wells there\r\nare sometimes slight errors from the lateral permeation of water, these\r\nerrors are less injurious to the accuracy of conclusions than those\r\nresulting from currents of cold air, which are almost always present in\r\nmines.  The general result of Reich's great work on the temperature of the\r\nmines in the Saxony mining districts gives a somewhat slower increase of the\r\nterrestrial heat, or 1 degree to 76.3 feet.  (Reich, 'Beob. uber die\r\nTemperatur des Gesteins in verschielen en Tiefen', 1834, s. 134.)  Phillips,\r\nhowever, found (Pogg., 'Annalen', bd. xxxiv., s. 191), in a shaft of the\r\ncoal-mine of Monk-wearmouth, near Newcastle, in which, as I have already\r\nremarked, excavations are going on at a depth of about 1500 feet below the\r\nlevel of the sea, an increase of 1 degree to 59.06 feet, a result almost\r\nidentical with that found by Arago in the Puits de Grenell.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must distinguish in our globe three different modes for the transmission\r\nof heat.  The first is periodic, and affects the temperature of the\r\nterrestrial strata according as the heat penetrates from above downward or\r\nfrom below upward, being influenced by the different positions of the Sun\r\nand the seasons of the year.  The second is likewise an effect of the Sun,\r\nalthough extremely slow:  a portion of the heat that has penetrated into the\r\nequatorial regions moves in the interior of the globe toward the poles,\r\nwhere it escapes into the atmosphere and the remoter regions of space.  The\r\nthird mode of transmission is the slowest of all, and is derived from the\r\nsecular cooling of the globe, and from the small portion of the primitive\r\nheat which is still being disengaged from the surface.\r\np 175\r\nThis loss experienced by the central heat must have been very considerable\r\nin the earliest epochs of the Earth's revolutions, but within historical\r\nperiods it has hardly been appreciable by our instruments.  The surface of\r\nthe Earth is therefore situated between the glowing heat of the inferior\r\nstrata and the universal regions of space, whose temperature is probably\r\nbelow the freezing-point of mercury.\r\n\r\nThe periodic changes of temperature which have been occasioned on the\r\nEarth's surface by the Sun's position and by meteorological processes, are\r\ncontinued in its interior, although to a very inconsiderable depth.  The\r\nslow conducting power of the ground diminishes this loss of heat in the\r\nwinter, and is very favorable to deep-rooted trees.  Points that lie at very\r\ndifferent depths on the same vertical line attain the maximum and minimum of\r\nthe imparted temperature at very different periods of time.  The further\r\nthey are removed from the surface, the smaller is this difference between\r\nthe extremes.  In the latitudes of our temperate zone (between 48 degrees\r\nand 52 degrees), the stratum of invariable temperature is at a depth of from\r\n59 to 64 feet, and at half that depth the oscillations of the thermometer,\r\nfrom the influence of the seasons, scarcely amount to half a degree.  In\r\ntropical climates this invariable stratum is only one foot below the\r\nsurface, and this fact has been ingeniously made use of by Boussingault to\r\nobtain a convenient, and as he believes, certain determination of the mean\r\ntemperature of the air of different places.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Boussingault, 'Sur la Profondeus a laquelle se trouve la Couche\r\nde Temperature invariable, entre les Tropiques', in the 'Annales de Chimie\r\net de Physique', t. liii., 1833, p. 225-247.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mean temperature of the air at a fixed point, or at a group of\r\ncontiguous points on the surface, is to a certain degree the fundamental\r\nelement of the climate and agricultural relations of a district; but the\r\nmean temperature of the whole surface is very different from that of the\r\nglobe itself.  The questions so often agitated, whether the mean temperature\r\nhas experienced any considerable differences in the course of centuries,\r\nwhether the climate of a country has deteriorated, and whether the winters\r\nhave not become milder and the summers cooler, can only be answered by means\r\nof the thermometer; this instrument has, however, scarcely been invented\r\nmore than two centuries and a half, and its scientific application hardly\r\ndates back 120 years.  The nature and novelty of the means interpose,\r\ntherefore, very narrow limits to our investigation regarding the temperature\r\np 176\r\nof the air.  It is quite otherwise, however, with the solution of the great\r\nproblem of the internal heat of the whole Earth.  As we may judge of\r\nuniformity of temperature from the unaltered time of vibration of a\r\npendulum, so we may also learn, from the unaltered rotatory velocity of the\r\nEarth, the amount of stability in the mean temperature of our globe.  This\r\ninsight into the relations between the 'length of the day' and the 'heat of\r\nthe Earth' is the result of one of the most brilliant applications of the\r\nknowledge we had long possessed of the planet.  The rotatory velocity of the\r\nEarth depends on its volume; and since, by the gradual cooling of the mass\r\nby radiation, the axis of rotation would become shorter, the rotatory\r\nvelocity would necessarily increase, and the length of the day diminish,\r\nwith a decrease of the temperature.  From the comparison of the secular\r\ninequalities in the motions of the Moon with the eclipses observed in\r\nancient times, it follows that, since the time of Hipparchus, that is, for\r\nfull 2000 years, the length of the day has certainly not diminished by the\r\nhundredth part of a second.  The decrease of the mean heat of the globe\r\nduring a period of 2000 years has not, therefore, taking the extremest\r\nlimits, diminished as much as 1/306th of a degree of Fahrenheit.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Laplace, 'Exp. du Syst. du Monde', p. 229 and 263; 'Mecanique\r\nCeleste', t. v., p. 18 and 72.  It should be remarked that the fraction\r\n1/306th of a degree of Fahrenheit of the mercurial thermometer, given in the\r\ntext as the limit of the stability of the Earth's temperature since the days\r\nof Hipparchus, rests on the assumption that the dilation of the substances\r\nof which the Earth is composed is equal to that of glass, that is to say,\r\n1/18,000th for 1 degree.  Regarding this hypothesis, see Arago in the\r\n'Annuaire' for 1834, p. 177-190.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis invariability of form presupposes also a great invariability in the\r\ndistribution of relations of density in the interior of the globe.  The\r\ntranslatory movements, which occasion the eruptions of our present volcanoes\r\nand of ferruginous lava, and the filling up of previously empty fissures and\r\ncavities with dense masses of stone, are consequently only to be regarded as\r\nslight superficial phenomena affecting merely one portion of the Earth's\r\ncrust, which, from their smallness when compared to the Earth's radius,\r\nbecome wholly insignificant.\r\n\r\nI have described the internal heat of our planet, both with reference to its\r\ncause and distribution, almost solely from the results of Fourier's\r\nadmirable investigations.  Poisson doubts the fact of the uninterrupted\r\nincrease of the Earth's heat\r\np 177\r\nfrom the surface to the center, and is of opinion that all heat has\r\npenetrated from without inward, and that the temperature of the globe\r\ndepends upon the very high or very low temperature of the regions of space\r\nthrough which the solar temperature of the regions of space, through which\r\nthe solar system has moved.  This hypothesis, imagined by one of the most\r\nacute mathematicians of our time, has not satisfied physicists or\r\ngeologists, or scarcely indeed any one besides its author.  But, whatever\r\nmay be the cause of the internal heat of our planet, and of its limited or\r\nunlimited increase in deep strata, it leads us, in this general sketch of\r\nnature, through the intimate connection of all primitive phenomena of\r\nmatter, and through the common bond by which molecular forces are united,\r\ninto the mysterious domain of magnetism.  Changes of temperature call forth\r\nmagnetic and electric currents.  Terrestrial magnetism, whose main\r\ncharacter, expressed in the three-fold manifestation of its forces, is\r\nincessant periodic variability, is ascribed either to the heated mass of the\r\nEarth itself,* or to those galvanic currents which we consider as\r\nelectricity in motion, that is, electricity moving in a closed circuit.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *William Gilbert, of Colchester, whom Galileo pronounced \"great\r\nto a degree that might be envied,\" said \"magnus magnes ipse est globus\r\nterrestris.\"  He ridicules the magnetic mountains of Frascatori, the great\r\ncontemporary of Columbus, as being magnetic poles:  \"rejicienda est vulgaris\r\nopinio de montibus magneticis, aut rupe aliqua magnetica, aut polo\r\nphantastico a polo mundi distante.\"  He assumes the declination of the\r\nmagnetic needle at any give point on the surface of the Earth to be\r\ninvariable (variatio uniuscujusque loci constans est), and refers the\r\ncurvatures of the isogonic lines to the configuration of continents and the\r\nrelative positions of sea basins, which possess a weaker magnetic force than\r\nthe solid masses rising above the ocean.  (Gilbert, 'de Magnete', ed. 1633,\r\np. 42, 98, 152 and 155.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** Gauss, 'Allgemcine Theorie des Erdmagnetismus', in the\r\n'Resultate aux den Beob. des Magnet. Vereins', 1838, s. 41, p. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mysterious course of the magnetic needle is equally affected by time and\r\nspace, by the sun's course, and by changes of place on the Earth's surface.\r\nBetween the tropics, the hour of the day may be known by the direction of\r\nthe needle as well as by the oscillations of the barometer.  It is affected\r\ninstantly, but only transiently, by the distant northern light as it shoots\r\nfrom the pole, flashing in beams of colored light across the heavens.  When\r\nthe uniform horary motion of the needle is disturbed by a magnetic storm,\r\nthe perturbation manifests itself 'simultaneously', in the strictest sense\r\nof the word, over hundreds and thousands of miles of sea and land, or\r\npropagates itself by degrees, in short intervals of time, in\r\np 178\r\nevery direction over the Earth's surface.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *There are also perturbations which are of a local character,\r\nand do not extend themselves far, and are probably less deep-seated.  Some\r\nyears ago I described a rare instance of this kind, in which an\r\nextraordinary disturbance was felt in the mines at Freiberg, but was not\r\nperceptible at Berlin.  ('Lettre de M. de Humboldt a Son Altesse Royale le\r\nDuc de Sussex sur les moyens propres a perfectionner la Connaissance du\r\nMagnetisme Terrestre', in Becquerel's 'Traite Experimental de l'Electricite'\r\nt. vii., p. 442.)  Magnetic storms which were simultaneously felt from\r\nSicily to Upsala, did not extend from Upsala to Alten.  (Gauss and Weber,\r\n'Resultate des Magnet. Vereins', 1839, 128; Lloyd, in the 'Comptes Rendus de\r\nl'Acad. des Sciences', t. xii., 1843, Sem. ii., p. 725 and 827.)  Among the\r\nnumerous examples that have been recently observed, of perturbations\r\noccurring simultaneously and extending over wide portions of the Earth's\r\nsurface, and which are collected in Sabine's important work ('Observ. on\r\nDays of unusual Magnetic Disturbance', 1843), one of the most remarkable is\r\nthat of the 25th of September, 1841, which was observed at Toronto in\r\nCanada, at the Cape of Good Hope, at Prague, and partially in Van Diemen's\r\nLand.  The English Sunday, on which it is deemed sinful, after midnight on\r\nSaturday, to register an observation, and to follow out the great phenomena\r\nof creation in their perfect development, interrupted the observations in\r\nVan Diemen's Land, where in consequence of the difference of the longitude,\r\nthe magnetic storm fell on the Sunday.  ('Observ.', p. xiv., 78, 85, and 87.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the former case, the simultaneous manifestation of the storm may serve,\r\nwithin certain limitations, like Jupiter's satellites, fire-signals, and\r\nwell-observed falls of shooting stars, for the geographical determination of\r\ndegrees of longitude.  We here recognize with astonishment that the\r\nperturbations of two small magnetic needles, even if suspended at great\r\ndepths below the surface, can measure the distances apart at which they are\r\nplaced, teaching us, for instance, how far Kasan is situated east of\r\nGottingen or of the banks of the Seine.  There are also districts in the\r\nearth where the mariner, who has been enveloped for many days in mist,\r\nwithout seeing either the sun or stars, and deprived of all means of\r\ndetermining the time, may know with certainty, from the variations in the\r\ninclination of the magnetic needle, whether he is at the north or the south\r\nof the port he is desirous of entering.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *I have described, in Lametherie's 'Journal de Physique', 1804,\r\nt. lix., p. 449, the application (alluded to in the text) of the magnetic\r\ninclination to the determination of latitude along a coast running north and\r\nsouth, and which, like that of Chili and Peru, is for a part of the year\r\nenveloped in mist ('garua').  In the locality I have just mentioned, this\r\napplication is of the greater importance, because, in consequence of the\r\nstrong current running northward as far as to Cape Parena, navigators incur\r\na great loss of time if they approach the coast to the north of the haven\r\nthey are seeking.  In the South Sea, from Callao de Lima harbor to Truxillo,\r\nwhich differ from each other in latitude by 3 degrees 57' I have observed a\r\nvariation of the magnetic inclination amounting to 9 degrees (centesimal\r\ndivision); and from Callao to Guayaquil, which differ in latitude by 9\r\ndegrees 50', a variation of 23.5 degrees.  (See my 'Relat. Hist.', t. iii.,\r\np. 622.)  At Guarmey (10 degrees 4' south lat.), Huaura (11 degrees 3' south\r\nlat.), and Chancay (11 degrees 4' south lat.), Huaura (11 degrees 3' south\r\nlat.), and Chancay (11 degrees 32' south lat.), the inclinations are 6.80\r\ndegrees, 9 degrees, and 10.35 degrees of the centesimal division.  The\r\ndetermination of position by means of the magnetic inclination has this\r\nremarkable feature connected with it, that where the ship's course cuts the\r\nisoclinalline almost perpendicularly, it is the only one that is independent\r\nof all determination of time, and consequently, of observations of the sun\r\nor stars.  It is only lately that I discovered, for the first time, that as\r\nearly as at the close of the sixteenth century, and consequently hardly\r\ntwenty years after Robert Norman had invented the inclinatorium, William\r\nGilbert, in his great work, 'De Magnete', proposed to determine the latitude\r\nby the inclination of the magnetic needle.  Gilbert ('Physiologia Nova de\r\nMagnete', lib. v., cap. 8, p. 200) commends the method as applicable \"aëre\r\ncaliginoso.\"  Edward Wright, in the introduction which he added to his\r\nmaster's great work, describes this proposal as \"worth much gold.\"  As he\r\nfell into the same error with Gilbert, of presuming that the isoclinal lines\r\ncoincided with the geographical parallel circles, and that the magnetic and\r\ngeographical equators were identical, he did not perceive that the proposed\r\nmethod had only a local and very limited application.\r\n\r\n\r\np 179\r\nWhen the needle, by its sudden disturbance in its horary course, indicates\r\nthe presence of a magnetic storm, we are still unfortunately ignorant\r\nwhether the seat of the disturbing cause is to be sought in the Earth itself\r\nor in the upper regions of the atmosphere.  If we regard the Earth as a true\r\nmagnet, we are obliged, according to the views entertained by Friedrich\r\nGauss (the acute propounder of a generaltheory of terrestrial magnetism), to\r\nascribe to every portion of the globe measuring one eighth of a cubic meter\r\n(or 3 7/10ths of a French cubic foot) in volume, an average amount of\r\nmagnetism equal to that contained in a magnetic rod of 1 lb. weight.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote[  *Gauss and Weber, 'Resultate des Magnet. Vereins', 1838, 31, s.\r\n146.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf iron and nickel, and probably, also, cobalt (but not chrome, as has long\r\nbeen believed),* are the only substances which become permanently magnetic,\r\nand retain polarity from a certain coerceive force, the phenomena of Arago's\r\nmagnetism of rotation and of Faraday's induced currents show, on the other\r\nhand, that all telluric substances may possibly be made transitorily\r\nmagnetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Faraday ('London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine', 1836,\r\nvol. viii., p. 178), pure cobalt is totally devoid of magnetic power.  I\r\nknow, however, that other celebrated chemists (Heinrich Rose and Wohler) do\r\nnot admit this as absolutely certain.  If out of two carefully-purified\r\nmasses of cobalt totally free from nickel, one appears altogether\r\nnon-magnetic (in a state of equilibrium), I think it probable that the other\r\nowes its magnetic property to a want of purity; and this opinion coincides\r\nwith Faraday's view.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of the\r\np 180\r\nfirst-mentioned of these great physicists, water, ice, glass, and carbon\r\naffect the vibrations of the needle entirely in the same manner as mercury\r\nin the rotation experiments.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annales de Chimie', t. xxxii., p. 214; Brewster,\r\n'Treaties on Magnetism', 1837, p. 111; Baumgartner, in the 'Zeitschrift fur\r\nPhys. und Mathem.', bd. ii., s. 419.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all substances show themselves to be, in a certain degree, magnetic\r\nwhen they are conductors, that is to say, when a current of electricity is\r\npassing through them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the knowledge of the attracting power of native iron magnets or\r\nloadstones appears to be of very ancient date among the nations of the West,\r\nthere is strong historical evidence in proof of the striking fact that the\r\nknowledge of the directive power of a magnetic needle and of its relation to\r\nterrestrial magnetism was peculiar to the Chinese, a people living in the\r\nextremest eastern portions of Asia.  More than a thousand years before our\r\nera, in the obscure age of Codrus, and about the time of the return of the\r\nHeraclidae to the Peloponnesus, the Chinese had already magnetic carriages,\r\non which the movable arm of the figure of a man continually pointed to the\r\nsouth, as a guide by which to find the way across the boundless grass plains\r\nof Tartary; nay, even in the third century of our era, therefore at least\r\n700 years before the use of the mariner's compass in European seas, Chinese\r\nvessels navigated the Indian Ocean* under the direction of magnetic needles\r\npointing to the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Examen Critique de l'Hist. de la Geographie', t.\r\niii., p. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have shown, in another work, what advantages this means of topographical\r\ndirection, and the early knowledge and application of the magnetic needle\r\ngave the Chinese geographers over the Greeks and Romans, to whom, for\r\ninstance, even the true direction of the Apennines and Pyrenees always\r\nremained unknown.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *'Asie Centrale', t. i., Introduction, p. xxxviii-xlii.  The\r\nWestern nations, the Greeks and the Romans, knew that magnetism could be\r\ncommunicated to iron, 'and that that metal would retain it for a length of\r\ntime'.  (\"Sola haec materia ferri vires, a maguete lapide accipit,\r\n'retinetque longo tempore.\"  Plin., xxxiv., 14.)  The great discovery of the\r\nterrestrial directive force depended, therefore, alone on this, that no one\r\nin the West had happened to observe an elongated fragment of magnetic iron\r\nstone, or a magnetic iron rod, floating, by the aid of a piece of wood, in\r\nwater, or suspended in the air by a thread, in such a position as to admit\r\nof free motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnetic power of our globe is manifested on the terrestrial surface in\r\nthree classes of phenomena, one of which exhibits itself in the varying\r\nintensity of the force, and the two others in the varying direction of the\r\ninclination, and in\r\np 181\r\nthe horizontal deviation from the terrestrial meridian of the spot.  Their\r\ncombined action may therefore be graphically represented by three systems of\r\nlines, the 'isodynamic, isoclinic', and 'isogonic' (or those of equal force,\r\nequal inclination, and equal declination).  The distances apart, and the\r\nrelative positions of these moving, oscillating, and advancing curves, do\r\nnot always remain the same.  The total deviation (variation or declination\r\nof the magnetic needle) has not at all changed, or, at any rate, not in any\r\nappreciable degree, during a whole century, at any particular point on the\r\nEarth's surface,* as, for instance, the western part of the Antilles, or\r\nSpitzbergen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *A very slow secular progression, or a local invariability of\r\nthe magnetic declination, prevents the confusion which might arise from\r\nterrestrial influences in the boundaries of land, when, with an utter\r\ndisregard for the correction of declination, estates are, after long\r\nintervals, measured by the mere application of the compass.  \"The whole mass\r\nof the bottomless pit of endless litigation by the invariability of the\r\nmagnetic declination in Jamica and the surrounding Archipelago during the\r\nwhole of the last century, all surveys of property there having been\r\nconducted solely by the compass.\"  See Robertson in the 'Philosophical\r\nTransactions' for 1806, Part ii., p. 348, 'On the Permanency of the Compass\r\nin Jamaica since 1660'.  In the mother country (England) the magnetic\r\ndeclination has varied by fully 14 degrees during the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn like manner, we observe that the isogonic curves, when they pass in their\r\nsecular motion from the surface of the sea to a continent or an island of\r\nconsiderable extent, continue for a long time in the same position, and\r\nbecome inflected as they advance.\r\n\r\nThese gradual changes in the forms assumed by the lines in their translatory\r\nmotions, and which so unequally modify the amount of eastern and western\r\ndeclination, in the course of time render it difficult to trace the\r\ntransitions and analogies of forms in the graphic representations belonging\r\nto different centuries.\r\n\r\nEach branch of a curve has its history, but this history does not reach\r\nfurther back among the nations of the West than the memorable epoch of the\r\n13th of September, 1492, when the re-discoverer of the New World found a\r\nline of no variation 3 degrees west of the meridian of the island of Flores,\r\none of the Azores.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *I have elsewhere shown that, from the documents which have come\r\ndown to us regarding the voyages of Columbus, we can, with much certainty,\r\nfix upon three places 'in the Atlantic line of no declination' for the 13th\r\nof September, 1492, the 21st of May, 1496, and the 16th of August, 1498.\r\nThe Atlantic line of no declination at that period ran from northeast to\r\nsouthwest. It then touched the South American continent a little east of\r\nCape Codera, while it is not observed to reach that continent on the\r\nnorthern coast of the Brazils.  (Humboldt, 'Examen Critique de l'Hist. de la\r\nGeogr.', t. iii., p. 44-48.)  From Gilbert's 'Physiologia Nova de Magnete',\r\nwe see plainly (and the fact is very remarkable) that in 1600 the\r\ndeclination was still null in the region of the Azores, just as it had been\r\nin the time of Columbus (lib. 4, cap. 1).  I believe that in my 'Examen\r\nCritique' (t. iii., p. 54) I have proved from documents that the celebrated\r\nline of demarkation by which Pope Alexander VI. divided the Western\r\nhemisphere between Portugal and Spain was not drawn through the most western\r\npoint of the Azores, because Columbus wished to convert a physical into a\r\npolitical division.  He attached great importance to the zone (raya) \"in\r\nwhich the compass shows no variation, where air and ocean, the later covered\r\nwith pastures of sea-weed, exhibit a peculiar constitution, where cooling\r\nwinds begin to blow, and where [as erroneous observations of the polar star\r\nled him to imagine] the form (sphericity) of the Earth is no longer the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of Europe, excepting a small\r\np 182\r\npart of Russia, has now a western declination, while at the close of the\r\nseventeenth century the needle first pointed due north, in London in 1657,\r\nand in Paris in 1669, there being thus a difference of twelve years,\r\nnotwithstanding the small distance between these two places.  In Eastern\r\nRussia, to the east of the mouth of the Volga, of Saratow, Nischni-Nowgorod,\r\nand Archangel, the easterly declination of Asia is advancing toward us.  Two\r\nadmirable observers, Hansteen and Adolphus Erman, have made us acquainted\r\nwith the remarkable double curvature of the lines of declination in the vast\r\nregion of Northern Asia; these being concave toward the pole between\r\nObdorsk, on the Oby, and Turuchansk, and convex between the Lake of Baikal\r\nand the Gulf of Ochotsk.  In this portion of the earth, in northern Asia,\r\nbetween the mountains of Werchojansk, Jakutsk, and the northern Korea, the\r\nisogonic lines form a remarkable closed system.  This oval configuration*\r\nrecurs regularly and over a great extent of the South Sea, almost as far as\r\nthe meridian of Pitcairn and the group of the Marquesas Islands, between 20\r\ndegrees north and 45 degrees\r\np 183\r\nsouth lat.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *To determine whether the two oval systems of isogonic lines, so\r\nsingularly included each within itself, will continue to advance for\r\ncenturies in the same inclosed form, or will unfold and expand themselves,\r\nis a question of the highest interest in the problem of the physical causes\r\nof terrestrial magnetism.  In the Eastern Asiatic nodes the declination\r\nincreases from without inward, while in the node or oval system of the South\r\nSea the opposite holds good; in fact, at the present time, in the whole\r\nSouth Sea to the east of the meridian of Kamt-schatka, there is no line\r\nwhere the declination is null, or, indeed, in which it is less than 2\r\ndegrees (Erman, in Pogg., 'Annal.', bd. xxxi, 129).  Yet Cornelius Schouten,\r\non Easter Sunday, 1616, appears to have found the declination null somewhere\r\nto the southeast of Nukahiva, in 15 degrees south lat. and 132 degrees west\r\nlong., and consequently in the middle of the present closed isogonal system.\r\n (Hansteen, 'Magnet. der Erde', 1819 § 28.)  It must not be forgotten, in\r\nthe midst of all these considerations, that we can only follow the direction\r\nof the magnetic lines in their progress as they are projected upon the\r\nsurface of the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne would almost be inclined to regard this singular configuration of\r\nclosed, almost concentric, lines of declination as the effect of a local\r\ncharacter of that portion of the globe; but if, in the course of centuries,\r\nthese apparently isolated systems should also advance, we must suppose, as\r\nin the case of all great natural forces, that the phenomenon arises from\r\nsome general cause.\r\n\r\nThe horary variations of the declination, which, although dependent upon\r\ntrue time, are apparently governed by the Sun, as long as it remains above\r\nthe horizon, diminish in angular value with the magnetic latitude of place.\r\nNear the equator, for instance, in the island of Rawak, they scarcely amount\r\nto three or four minutes, while they are from thirteen to fourteen minutes\r\nin the middle of Europe.  As in the whole northern hemisphere the north\r\npoint of the needle moves from east to west on an average from 8 1/2 in the\r\nmorning until 1 1/2 at mid-day, while in the southern hemisphere the same\r\nnorth point moves from west to east,* attention has recently been drawn,\r\nwith much justice, to the fact that there must be a region of the Earth\r\nbetween the terrestrial and the magnetic equator where no horary deviations\r\nin the declination are to be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire', 1836, p. 284, and 1840, p. 330-338.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fourth curve, which might be called the 'curve of no motion', or,\r\nrather, 'the line of no variation of horary declination', has not yet been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe term 'magnetic poles' has been applied to those points of the Earth's\r\nsurface where the horizontal power disappears, and more importance has been\r\nattached to these points than properly appertains to them;* and in like\r\nmanner, the curve, where the inclination of the needle is null, has been\r\ntermed the 'magnetic equator'.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Gauss, 'Allg. Theorie des Erdmagnet.', 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position of this line and its secular change of configuration have been\r\nmade an object of careful investigation in modern times.  According to the\r\nadmirable work of Duperrey,* who crossed the magnetic equator six times\r\nbetween 1822 and 1825, the nodes of the two equators, that is to say, the\r\ntwo points at which the line without inclination intersects the terrestrial\r\nequator, and consequently passes from one henisphere into the other, are so\r\nunequally placed, that in 1825 the node near the island of St. Thomas, on\r\nthe western\r\np 184\r\ncoast of Africa, was 188 1/2 degrees distant from the node in the South Sea,\r\nclose to the little islands of Gilbert, nearly in the meridian of the Viti\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Duperrey, 'De la Configuration de l'Equateur Magnetique', in\r\nthe 'Annales de Chimie', t. xlv., p. 371 and 379.  (See also, Morlet, in the\r\n'Memoires presentes par divers Savans a l'Acad. Roy. des Sciences', t. iii.,\r\np. 132.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the present century, at an elevation of 11,936 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, I made an astronomical determination of the\r\npoint (7 degrees 1' south lat., 48 degrees 40' west long. from Paris),\r\nwhere, in the interior of the New Continent, the chain of the Andes is\r\nintersected by the magnetic equator between Quito and Lima.  To the west of\r\nthis point, the magnetic equator continues to traverse the South Sea in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, at the same time slowly drawing near the terrestrial\r\nequator.  It first passes into the northern hemisphere a little before it\r\napproaches the Indian Archipelago, just touches the southern points of Asia,\r\nand enters the African continent to the west of Socotora, almost in the\r\nStraits of Bab-el-Mandeb, where it is most distant from the terrestrial\r\nequator.  After intersecting the unknown regions of the interior of Africa\r\nin a southwest direction, the magnetic equator re-enters the south tropical\r\nzone in the Gulf of Guinea, and retreats so far from the terrestrial equator\r\nthat it touches the Brazilian coast near Os Ilheos, north of Porto Seguro,\r\nin 15 degrees south lat.  From thence to the elevated plateaux of the\r\nCordilleras, between the silver mines of micuipampa and Caxamarca, the\r\nancient seat of the Incas, where I observed the inclination, the line\r\ntraverses the whole of South America, which in these latitudes is as much a\r\nmagnetic 'terra incognita' as the interior of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe recent observations of Sabine* have shown that the node near the island\r\nof St. Thomas has moved 4 degrees from east to west between 1825 and 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the remarkable chart of isoclinic lines in the Atlantic\r\nOcean for the years 1825 and 1837, in Sabine's 'Contributions to Terrestrial\r\nMagnetism', 1840, p. 134.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely important to know whether the opposite pole, near the\r\nGilbert Islands, in the South Sea, has aproached the meridian of the\r\nCarolinas in a westerly direction.  These general remarks will be sufficient\r\nto connect the different systems of isoclinic non-parallel lines with the\r\ngreat phenomenon of equilibrium which is manifested in the magnetic equator.\r\n It is no small advantage, in the exposition of the laws of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism, that the magnetic equator (whose oscillatory change of form and\r\nwhose nodal motion exercise an influence on the inclination of the needle in\r\nthe remotest districts of the world, in consequence of the altered magnetic\r\nlatitudes)* should traverse the\r\np 185\r\nocean throughout its whole course, excepting about one fifth, and\r\nconsequently be made so much more accessible, owing to the remarkable\r\nrelations in space between the sea and land, and to the means of which we\r\nare now possessed for determining with much exactness both the declination\r\nand the inclination at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Ueber die seculäre Veränderung der Magnetischen\r\nInclination' (On the secular Change in the Magnetic Inclination), in Pogg.\r\n'Annal.', bd. sv., s. 322.\r\n\r\nWe have described the distribution of magnetism on the surface of our planet\r\naccording to the two forms of 'declination' and 'inclination'; it now,\r\ntherefore, remains for us to speak of the 'intensity of the force' which is\r\ngraphically expressed by isodynamic curves (or lines of equal intensity).\r\nThe investigation and measurement of this force by the oscillations of a\r\nvertical or horizontal needle have only excited a general and lively\r\ninterest in its telluric relations since the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.  The application of delicate optical and chronometrical instruments\r\nhas rendered the measurement of this horizontal power susceptible of a\r\ndegree of accuracy far surpassing that attained in any other magnetic\r\ndeterminations.  The isogonic lines are the more important in their\r\nimmediate application to navigation, while we find from the most recent\r\nviews that isodynamic lines, especially those which indicate the horizontal\r\nforce, are the most valuable elements in the theory of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Gauss, 'Resultate der Beob. des Magn. Vereins', 1838, 21;\r\nSabine, 'Report on the Variations of the Magnetic Intensity', p. 63.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest facts yielded by observation is, that the intensity of\r\nthe total force increases from the equator toward the pole.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The following is the history of the discovery of the law that\r\nthe intensity of the force increases (in general) with the magnetic\r\nlatitude.  When I was anxious to attach myself, in 1798, to the expedition\r\nof Captain Bandin, who intended to circumnavigate the globe, I was requested\r\nby Borda, who took a warm interest in the success of my project, to examine\r\nthe oscillations of a vertical needle in the magnetic meridian in different\r\nlatitudes in each hemisphere, in order to determine whether the intensity of\r\nthe force was the same, or whether it varied in different places.  During my\r\ntravels in the tropical regions of America, I paid much attention to this\r\nsubject.  I observed that the same needle, which in the space of ten minutes\r\nmade 245 oscillations in Paris, 246 in the Havana, and 242 in Mexico,\r\nperformed only 216 oscillations during the same period at St. Carlos del Rio\r\nNegro (1 degree 53' north lat. and 80 degrees 40' west long. from Paris), on\r\nthe magnetic equator, i.e., the line in which the inclination =0; in Peru (7\r\ndegrees 1' south lat. and 80 degrees 40' west long. from Paris) only\r\n211;while at Lima (12 degrees 2' south lat.) the number rose to 219.  I\r\nfound, in the years intervening between 1799 and 1803, that the whole force,\r\nif we assume it at 1.0000 on the magnetic equator in the Peruvian Andes,\r\nbetween Micuipampa and Caxamarca, may be expressed at Paris by 1.3482, in\r\nMexico by 1.3155, in San Carlos del Rio Negro by 1.0480, and in Lima by\r\n1.0773.  When I developed this law of the variable intensity of terrestrial\r\nmagnetic force, and supported it by the numerical value of observations\r\ninstituted in 104 different places, in a Memoir read before the Paris\r\nInstitute on the 26th Frimaire, An. XIII. (of which the mathematical portion\r\nwas contributed by M. Biot), the facts were regarded as altogether new.  It\r\nwas only after the reading of the paper, as Biot expressly states\r\n(Lametherie, 'Journal de Physique', t. lix., p. 446, note 2) and as I have\r\nrepeated in 'the Relation Historique', t. i., p. 262, note 1, that M. de\r\nRossel communicated to Biot his oscillation experiments made six years\r\nearlier (between 1791 and 1794) in Van Diemen's Land, in Java, and in\r\nAmboyna.  These experiments gave evidence of the same law of decreasing\r\nforce in the Indian Archipelago.  It must, I think be supposed, that this\r\nexcellent man, when he wrote his work, was not aware of the regularity of\r\nthe augmentation and diminution of the intensity as before the reading of my\r\npaper he never mentioned this (certainly not unimportant) physical law to\r\nany of our mutual friends, La Place, Delambre, Prony, or Biot.  It was not\r\ntill 1808, four years after my return from America that the observations\r\nmade by M. de Rossel were published in the 'Voyage de l'Entrecasteaux', t.\r\nii., p. 287 , 291, 321, 480, and 644.  Up to the present day it is still\r\nusual, in all the tables of magnetic intensity which have been published in\r\nGermany (Hausteen, 'Magnet. der Erde', 1819, s. 71; Gauss, 'Beob. des\r\nMagnet. Vereins', 1838, s. 36-39; Erman, 'Physikal. Beob.', 1841, s.\r\n529-579), in England (Sabine, 'Report on Magnet. Intensity', 1838, p. 43-62;\r\n'Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism', 1843), and in France (Becquerel,\r\n'Traite de Electr. et de Magnet.', t. vii., p. 354-367), to reduce the\r\noscillations observed in any part of the Earth to the standard of force\r\nwhich I found on the magnetic equator in Northern Peru, so that, according\r\nto the unit thus arbitrarily assumed, the intensity of the magnetic force at\r\nParis is put down as 1.348.  The observations made by Lamanon in the\r\nunfortunate expedition of La Perouse, during the stay at Teneriffe (1785),\r\nand on the voyage to Macao (1787), are still older than those of Admiral\r\nRossel.  They were sent to the Academy of Sciences, and it is known that\r\nthey were in the possession of Condorcet in the July of 1787 (Becquerel, t.\r\nvii., p. 320); but, notwithstanding the most careful search, they are not\r\nnow to be found.  From a copy of a very important letter of Lamanon, now in\r\nthe possession of Captain Duperrey, which was addressed to the then\r\nperpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, but was omitted in the\r\nnarrative of the 'Voyage de La Perouse', it is stated \"that the attractive\r\nforce of the magnet is less in the tropics than when we approach the poles,\r\nand that the magnetic intensity deduced from the number of oscillations of\r\nthe needle of the inclination-compass varies and increases with the\r\nlatitude.\"  If the Academicians, while they continued to expect the return\r\nof the unfortunate La Perouse, had felt themselves justified, in the course\r\nof 1787, in publishing a truth which had been independently discovered by no\r\nless than three different travelers, the theory of terrestrial magnetism\r\nwould have been extended by the knowledge of a new class of observations,\r\ndating eighteen years earlier than they now do.  This simple statement of\r\nfacts may probably justify the observations contained in the third volume of\r\nmy 'Relation Historique' p. 615):  \"The observations on the variation of\r\nterrestrial magnetism, to which I have devoted myself for thirty-two years,\r\nby means of instruments which admit of comparison with one another, in\r\nAmerica, Europe, and Asia, embrace an area extending over 188 degrees of\r\nlongitude, from the frontier of Chinese Dzoungarie to the west of the South\r\nSea bathing the coasts of Mexico and Peru, and reaching from 60 degrees\r\nnorth lat. to 12 degrees south lat.  I regard the discovery of the law of\r\nthe decrement of magnetic force from the pole to the equator as the most\r\nimportant result of my American voyage.\"  Although not absolutely certain,\r\nit is very probable that Condorcet read Lamanon's letter of July, 1787, at a\r\nmeeting of the Paris Academy of Sciences; and such a simple reading I regard\r\nas a sufficient act of publication.  ('Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes',\r\n1842, p. 463.)  The first recognition of the law belongs, therefore, beyond\r\nall question, to the comparison of La Perouse; but, long disregarded or\r\nforgotten, the knowledge of the law that the intensity of the magnetic force\r\nof the Earth varied with the latitude, did not, I conceive, acquire an\r\nexistence in science until the publication of my observations from 1798 to\r\n1804.  The object and the length of this note will not be indifferent to\r\nthose who are familiar with the connection with it, and who, from their own\r\nexperience, are aware that we are apt to attach some value to that which has\r\ncost us the uninterrupted labor of five years, under the pressure of a\r\ntropical climate, and of perilous mountain expeditions.\r\n\r\n\r\np 186\r\nThe knowledge which we possess of the quantity of this increase, and of all\r\nthe numerical relations of the law of intensity\r\np 187\r\naffecting the whole Earth, is especially due, since 1819, to the unwearied\r\nactivity of Edward Sabine, who, after having observed the oscillations of\r\nthe same needles at the American north pole, in Greenland, at Spitzbergen,\r\nand on the coasts of Guinea and Brazil, has continued to collect and arrange\r\nall the facts capable of explaining the direction of the isodynamic system\r\nin zones for a small part of South America.  These lines are not parallel to\r\nlines of equal inclination (isoclinic line), and the intensity of the force\r\nis not at its minimum at the magnetic equator, as has been supposed, nor is\r\nit even equal at all parts of it.  If we compare Erman's observations in the\r\nsouthern part of the Atlantic Ocean, where a faint zone (0.706) extends from\r\nAngola over the island of St. Helena to the Brazilian coast, with the most\r\nrecent investigations of the celebrated navigator James Clark Ross, we shall\r\nfind that on the surface of our planet the force increases almost in the\r\nrelation of 1:3 toward the magnetic south pole, where Victoria Land extends\r\nfrom Cape Crozier toward the volcano Erebus, which has been raised to an\r\nelevation of 12,600 feet above the ice.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *From the observations hitherto collected, it appears that the\r\nmaximum of intensity for the whole surface of the Earth is 2.052, and the\r\nminimum 0.706.  Both phenomena occur in the southern hemisphere; the former\r\nin 73 degrees 47' S. lat., and 169 degrees 30'E. long. from Paris, near\r\nMount Crozier, west-northwest of the south magnetic pole, at a place where\r\nCaptain James Ross found the inclination of the needle to be 87 degrees 11'\r\n(Sabine, 'Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism', 1843, No. 5, p. 231); the\r\nlatter, observed by Erman at 19 degrees 59' S. lat., and 37 degrees 24' W.\r\nlong. from Paris, 320 miles eastward from the Brazilian coast of Espiritu\r\nSanto (Erman, 'Phys. Beob.', 1841, s. 570), at a point where the inclination\r\nis only 7 degrees 55'.  The actual ratio of the two intensities is therefore\r\nas 1 to 2.906.  It was long believed that the greatest intensity of the\r\nmagnetic force was only two and a half times as great as the weakest\r\nexhibited on the Earth's surface.  (Sabine, 'Report on Magnetic Intensity',\r\np. 82.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the intensity near the magnetic south pole\r\np 188\r\nbe expressed by 2.052 (the unit still employed being the intensity which I\r\ndiscovered on the magnetic equator in Northern Peru), Sabine found it was\r\nonly 1.624 at the magnetic north pole near Melville Island (70 degrees 27'\r\nnorth lat.), while it is 1.803 at New York, in the United States, which has\r\nalmost the same latitude as Naples.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant discoveries of Oersted, Arago, and Faraday have established a\r\nmore intimate connection between the electric tension of the atmosphere and\r\nthe magnetic tension of our terrestrial globe.  While Oestred has discovered\r\nthat electricity excites magnetism in the neighborhood  of the conducting\r\nbody, Faraday's experiments have elicited electric currents from the\r\nliberated magnetism.  Magnetism is one of the manifold forms under which\r\nelectricity reveals itself.  The ancient vague presentiment of the identity\r\nof electric and magnetic attraction has been verified in our own times.\r\n\"When electrum (amber),\" says Pliny, in the spirit of the Ionic natural\r\nphilosophy of Thales,* is 'animated' by friction and heat, it will attract\r\nbark and dry leaves precisely as the loadstone attracts iron.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Of amber (succinum, glessum) Pliny observes (xxxvii., 3),\r\n\"Genera ejus plura.  Attritu digitorum accepta caloris anima trahunt in se\r\npaleas ac folia arida quae levia sunt, ac ut magnes lapis ferri ramenta\r\nquoque.\"  (Plato, 'in Timaeo', p. 80.  Martin, 'Etude sur le Timee', t. ii.,\r\np. 343-346.  Strabo, xv., p. 703, Casaub,; Clemens Alex., 'Strom.', ii., p.\r\n370, where, singularly enough, a difference is made between [Greek words])\r\nWhen Thales, in Aristot., 'de Anima', 1, 2, and Hippias, in Diog. Laert.,\r\ni., 24, describe the magnet and amber as possessing a soul, they refer only\r\nto a moving principle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same words may be found in the literature of an Asiatic nation, and\r\noccur in a eulogium on the loadstone by the Chinese physicist Kuopho.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"The magnet attracts iron as amber does the smallest grain of\r\nmustard seed.  It is like a breath of wind which mysteriously penetrates\r\nthrough both, and communicates itself with the rapidity of an arrow.\"  These\r\nare the words of Kuopho, a Chinese panegyrist on the magnet, who wrote in\r\nthe beginning of the fourth century. (Klaproth, 'Lettre a M. A. de Humboldt,\r\nsur l'Invention de la Boussole', 1834, p. 125.)\r\n\r\nI observed with astonishment,\r\np 189\r\non the woody banks of the Orinoco, in the sports of the natives, that the\r\nexcitement of electricity by friction was known to these savage races, who\r\noccupy the very lowest place in the scale of humanity.  Children may be seen\r\nto rub the dry, flat, and shining seeds or husks of a trailing plant\r\n(probably a 'Negretia') until they are able to attract threads of cotton and\r\npieces of bamboo cane.  That which thus delights the naked copper-colored\r\nIndian is calculated to awaken in our minds a deep and earnest impression.\r\nWhat a chasm divides the electric pastime of these savages from the\r\ndiscovery of a metallic conductor discharging its electric shocks, or a pile\r\ncomposed of many chemically-decomposing substances, or a light-engendering\r\nmagnetic apparatus!  In such a chasm lie buried thousands of years that\r\ncompost the history of the intellectual development of mankind!\r\n\r\nThe incessant change or oscillatory motion which we discover in all magnetic\r\nphenomena, whether in those of the inclincation, declination, and intensity\r\nof these forces, according to the hours of the day and the night, and the\r\nseasons and the course of the whole year, leads us to conjecture the\r\nexistence of very various and partial systems of electric currents on the\r\nsurface of the Earth.  Are these currents, as in Seebeck's experiments,\r\nthermo-magnetic, and excited directly from unequal distribution of heat?  or\r\nshould we not rather regard them as induced by the position of the Sun and\r\nby solar heat?*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"The phenomena of periodical variations depend manifestly on\r\nthe action of solar heat, operating probably through the medium of\r\nthermo-electric currents induced on the Earth's surface.  Beyond this rude\r\nguess, however, nothing is as yet known of their physical cause.  It is even\r\nstill a matter of speculation whether the solar influence be a principal or\r\nonly a subordinate cause in the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism.\"\r\n('Observations to be made in the Antarctic Expedition', 1840, p. 35.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHave the rotation of the planets, and the different degrees of velocity\r\nwhich the individual zones acquire, according to their respective distances\r\nfrom the equator, any influence on the distribution of magnetism?  Must we\r\nseek the seat of these currents, that is to say, of the disturbed\r\nelectricity, in the atmosphere, in the regions of planetary space, or in the\r\npolarity of the Sun and Moon?  Galileo, in his celebrated 'Dialogo', was\r\ninclined to ascribe the parallel direction of the axis of the Earth to a\r\nmagnetic point of attraction seated in universal space.\r\n\r\nIf we represent to ourselves the interior of the Earth as fused and\r\nundergoing an enormous pressure, and at a degree of temperature the amount\r\nof which we are unable to assign,\r\np 190\r\nwe must renounce all idea of a magnetic nucleus of the Earth.  All magnetism\r\nis certainly not lost until we arrive at a white heat,* and it is manifested\r\nwhen iron is at a dark red heat, however different, therefore, the\r\nmodifications may be which are excited in substances in their molecular\r\nstate, and in the coercive force depending upon that condition in\r\nexperiments of this nature, there will still remain a considerable thickness\r\nof the terrestrial stratum, which might be assumed to be the seat of\r\nmagnetic currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Barlow, in the 'Philos. Trans.' for 1822, Pt. i., p. 117; Sir\r\nDavid Brewster, 'Treatise on Magnetism', p. 129.  Long before the times of\r\nGilbert and Hooke, it was taught in the Chinese work 'Ow-thea-tsou' that\r\nheat diminished the directive force of the magnetic needle.  (Klaproth,\r\n'Lettre a M. A. de Humboldt, sur l'Invention de la Boussole', p. 96.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old explanation of the horary variations of declination by the\r\nprogressive warming of the Earth in the apparent revolution of the Sun from\r\neast to west must be limited to the uppermost surface, since thermometers\r\nsunk into the Earth, which are now being accurately observed at so many\r\ndifferent places, show how slowly the solar heat penetrates even to the\r\ninconsiderable depth of a few feet.  Moreover, the thermic condition of the\r\nsurface of water, by which two thirds of our planet is covered, is not\r\nfavorable to such modes of explanation, when we have reference to an\r\nimmediate action and not to an effect of induction in the aërial and\r\naqueous investment of our terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of our knowledge, it is impossible to afford a\r\nsatisfactory reply to all questions regarding the ultimate physical causes\r\nof these phenomena.  It is only with reference to that which presents itself\r\nin the triple manifestations of the terrestrial force, as a measurable\r\nrelation of space and time, and as a stable element in the midst of change,\r\nthat science has recently made such brilliant advances by the aid of the\r\ndetermination of mean numerical values.  From Toronto in Upper Canada to the\r\nCape of Good Hope and Van Diemen's Land, from Paris to Pekin, the Earth has\r\nbeen covered, since 1828, with magnetic observatories,* in which every\r\nregular\r\np 191\r\nor irregular manifestation of the terrestrial force is detected by\r\nuninterrupted and simultaneous observations.  A variation\r\np 192\r\nof 1/40000th of the magnetic intensity is measured, and at certain epochs,\r\nobservations are made at intervals of 2 1/2 minutes, and continued for\r\ntwenty-four hours consecutively.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *As the first demand for the establishment of these\r\nobservatories (a net-work of stations, provided with similar instruments)\r\nproceeded from me, I did not dare to cherish the hope that I should live\r\nlong enough to see the time when both hemispheres should be uniformly\r\ncovered with magnetic houses under the associated activity of able\r\nphysicists and astronomers.  This has, however, been accomplished, and\r\nchiefly through the liberal and continued support of the Russian and British\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n[footnote continues]  In the years 1806 and 1807, I and my friend and\r\nfellow-laborer, Herr Oltmanns, while at Berlin, observed the movements of\r\nthe needle, especially at the times of the solstices and equinoxes, from\r\nhour to hour, and often from half hour to half hour, for five or six days\r\nand nights uninterruptedly.  I had persuaded myself that continuous and\r\nuninterrupted observations of several days and nights (observatio perpetua)\r\nwere preferable to the single observations of many months.  The apparatus, a\r\nProny's magnetic telescope, suspended in a glass case by a thread devoid of\r\ntorsion, allowed angles of seven or eight seconds to be read off on a\r\nfinely-divided scale, placed at a proper distance, and lighted at night by\r\nlamps.  Magnetic perturbations (storms), which occasionally recurred at the\r\nsame hour on several successive nights, led me even then to desire extremely\r\nthat similar apparatus should be used to the east and west of Berlin, in\r\norder to distinguish general terrestrial phenomena from those which are mere\r\nlocal disturbances, depending on the inequality of heat in different parts\r\nof the Earth, or on the cloudiness of the atmosphere.  My departure to\r\nParis, and the long period of political disturbance that involved the whole\r\nof the west of Europe, prevented my wish from being then accomplished.\r\n(OErsted's great discovery (1820) of the intimate connection between\r\nelectricity and magnetism again excited a general interest (which had long\r\nflagged) in the periodical variations of the electro-magnetic tension of the\r\nEarth.  Arago, who many years previously had commenced in the Observatory at\r\nParis, with a new and excellent declination instrument by Gambey, the\r\nlongest uninterrupted series of horary observations which we possess in\r\nEurope, showed by a comparison with simultaneous observations of\r\nperturbation made at Kasan, what advantages might be obtained from\r\ncorresponding measurements of declination.  When I returned to Berlin, after\r\nan eighteen years' residence in France, I had a small magnetic house erected\r\nin the autumn of 1828, not only with the view of carrying on the work\r\ncommenced in 1806, but more with the object that simultaneous observations\r\nat hours previously determined might be made at Berlin, Paris, and Freiburg,\r\nat a depth of 35 fathoms below the surface.  The simultaneous occurrence of\r\nthe perturbations, and the parallelism of the movements for October and\r\nDecember, 1829, were then graphically represented.  (Pogg., 'Annalen', bd.\r\nxix., s. 357, taf. i.-iii.)  An expedition into Northern Asia, undertaken in\r\n1829, by command of the Emperor of Russia, soon gave me an opportunity of\r\nworking out my plan on a larger scale.  The plan was laid before a select\r\ncommittee of one of the Imperial Academies of Science, and, under the\r\nprotection of the Director of the Mining Department, Count von Cancrin, and\r\nthe excellent superintendence of Professor Kupffer, magnetic stations were\r\nappointed over the whole of Northern Asia, from Nicolajeff, in the line\r\nthrough Catharinenburg, Barnaul, and Nertschinsk, to Pekin.\r\n\r\n[footnote continues]  The year 1832 ('Gottinger gelehrte Anzeigen', st. 206)\r\nis distinguished as the great epoch in which the profound author of a\r\ngeneral theory of terrestrial magnetism, Friedrich Gauss, erected apparatus,\r\nconstructed on a new principle, in the Gottingen Observatory.  The magnetic\r\nobservatory was finished in 1834, and in the same year Gauss distributed new\r\ninstruments, with instructions for their use, in which the celebrated\r\nphysicist, Wilhelm Weber, took extreme interest, over a large portion of\r\nGermany and Sweden, and the whole of Italy.  ('Resultate der Beob. des\r\nMagnetischen Verceins in Jahr' 1338, s. 135, and Poggend., 'Annalen.' bd.\r\nxxxiii., s. 426.)  In the magnetic association that was now formed with\r\nGottingen for its center, simultaneous observations have been undertaken\r\nfour times a year since 1836, and continued uninterruptedly for twenty-four\r\nhours.  The periods, however, do not coincide with those of the equinoxes\r\nand solstices, which I had proposed and followed out in 1830.  Up to this\r\nperiod, Great Britain, in possession of the most extensive commerce and the\r\nlargest navy in the world, had taken no part in the movement which since\r\n1828 had begun to yield important results for the more fixed ground-work of\r\nterrestrial magnetism.  I had the good fortune, by a public appeal from\r\nBerlin which I sent in April 1836, to the Duke of Sussex, at that time\r\nPresident of the Royal Society (Lettre de M. de Humboldt a S. A. R. le Duc\r\nde Sussex, sur les moyens propres a  perfectionner la connaissance du\r\nmagnetisme terrestre par l'establissement des stations magnetiques et\r\nd'observations correspondantes), to excite a friendly interest in the\r\nundertaking which it had so long been the chief object of my wish to carry\r\nout.  In my letter to the Duke of Sussex I urged the establishment of\r\npermanent stations in Canada, St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of\r\nFrance, Ceylon, and New Holland, which five years previously I had advanced\r\nas good positions.  The Royal Society appointed a joint physical and\r\nmeteorological committee, which not only proposed to the government the\r\nestablishment of fixed magnetic observatories in both hemispheres, but also\r\nthe equipment of a naval expedition for magnetic observations in the\r\nAntarctic Seas.  It is needless to proclaim the obligations of science to\r\nthe great activity of Sir John Herschel, Sabine, Airy, and Lloyd, as well as\r\nthe powerful support that was afforded by the British Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science at their meeting held at Newcastle in 1838.  In June,\r\n1839, the Antarctic magnetic expedition, under the command of Captain James\r\nClark Ross, was fully arranged; and now, since its successful return, we\r\nreap the double fruits of the highly important geographical discoveries\r\naround the south pole, and a series of simultaneous observations at eight or\r\nten magnetic stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great English astronomer and physicist has calculated* that the mass of\r\nobservations which are in progress will accumulate in the course of three\r\nyears to 1,958,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the article on 'Terrestrial Magnetism', in the 'Quarterly\r\nReview' 1840, vol. lxvi., p. 271-312.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever before has so noble and cheerful a spirit presided over the inquiry\r\ninto the 'quantitative' relations of the laws of the phenomena of nature.\r\nWe are, therefore, justified in hoping that these laws, when compared with\r\nthose which govern the atmosphere and the remoter regions of space, may, by\r\ndegrees, lead us to a more intimate acquaintance with the genetic conditions\r\nof magnetic phenomena.  As yet we can only boast of having opened a greater\r\nnumber of paths which may possibly lead to an explanation of this subject.\r\nIn the physical science of terrestrial\r\np 193\r\nmagnetism, which must not be confounded with the purely mathematical branch\r\nof the study, those persons only will obtain perfect satisfaction who, as in\r\nthe science of the meteorological processes of the atmosphere conveniently\r\nturn aside the practical bearing of all phenomena that can not be explained\r\naccording to their own views.\r\n\r\nTerrestrial magnetism, and the electro-dynamic forces computed by the\r\nintellectual Ampere,* stand in simultaneous and intimate connection with the\r\nterrestrial or polar light, as well as with the internal and external heat\r\nof our planet, whose magnetic poles may be considered as the poles of cold.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Instead of ascribing the internal heat of the Earth to the\r\ntransition of matter from a vapor-like fluid to a solid condition, which\r\naccompanies the formation of the planets, Ampere has propounded the idea,\r\nwhich I regard as highly improbable, that the Earth's temperature may be the\r\nconsequence of the continuous chemical action of a nucleus of the metals of\r\nthe earths and alkalies on the oxydizing external crust.  \"It can not be\r\ndoubted,\" he observes in his masterly 'Theorie des Phenomenes\r\nElectro-dynamiques', 1826, p. 199, \"that electro-magnetic currents exist in\r\nthe interior of the globe, and that these currents are the cause of its\r\ntemperature.  They arise from the action of a central metallic nucleus,\r\ncomposed of the metals discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy, acting on the\r\nsurrounding oxydized layer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **The remarkable connection between the curvature of the\r\nmagnetic lines and that of my isothermal lines was first detected by Sir\r\nDavid Brewster.  See the 'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh',\r\nvol. ix., 1821, p. 318, and 'Treatise on Magnetism', 1837, p. 42, 44, 47,\r\nand 268.  This distinguished physicist admist two cold poles (poles of\r\nmaximum cold) in the northern hemisphere, an American one near Cape Walker\r\n(73 degrees lat., 100 degrees W. long.), and an Asiatic one (73 degrees\r\nlat., 80 degrees E. long.); whence arise, according to him, two hot and two\r\ncold meridians, i.e., meridians of greatest heat and cold.  Even in the\r\nsixteenth century, Acosts ('Historia Natural de las Indias', 1589, lib. i.,\r\ncap. 17), grounding his opinion on the observations of a very experienced\r\nPortuguese pilot, taught that there were four lines without declination.  It\r\nwould seem from the controversy of Henry Bond (the author of 'The Longitude\r\nFound', 1676) with Beckborrow, that this view in some measure influenced\r\nHalley in his theory of four magnetic poles.  See my 'Examen Critique de\r\nl'Hist. de la Geographie', t. iii., p. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bold conjecture hazarded one hundred and twenty-eight years since by\r\nHalley,* that the Aurora Borealis was a magnetic phenomenon, has acquired\r\nempirical certainty from Faraday's brilliant discovery of the evolution of\r\nlight by magnetic forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Halley, in the 'Philosophical Transactions', vol. xxix. (for\r\n1714-1716), No. 341.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe northern light is preceded by premonitory signs.  Thus, in the morning\r\nbefore the occurrence of the phenomenon, the irregular horary course of the\r\nmagnetic needle generally indicates a disturbance of the equilibrium in the\r\ndistribution of\r\np 194\r\nterrestrial magnetism.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[The Aurora Borealis of October 24th, 1847, which was one of\r\nthe most brilliant ever known in this country, was preceded by great\r\nmagnetic disturbance.  On the 22d of October the maximum of the west\r\ndeclination was 23 degrees 10'; on the 23d the position of the magnet was\r\ncontinually changing, and the extreme west declinations were between 22\r\ndegrees 44' and 23 degrees 37';on the night between the 23d and 24th of\r\nOctober, the changes of position were very large and very frequent, the\r\nmagnet at times moving across the field so rapidly that a difficulty was\r\nexperienced in following it.  During the day of the 24th of October there\r\nwas a constant change of position, but after midnight, when the Aurora began\r\nperceptibly to decline in brightness, the disturbance entirely ceased.  The\r\nchanges of position of the horizontal-force magnet were as large and as\r\nfrequent as those of the declination magnet, but the vertical-force magnet\r\nwas at no time so much affected as the other two instruments.  See 'On the\r\nAurora Borealis, as it was seen on Sunday evening, October 24th, 1847, at\r\nBlackheath,' by James Glaisher, Esq., of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,\r\nin the 'London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philos. Mag and Journal of Science for\r\nNov.', 1847, by John H. Morgan, Esq.  We must not omit to mention that\r\nmagnetic disturbance is now registered by a 'photographic' process:  the\r\nself-registering photographic apparatus used for this purpose in the\r\nObservatory at Greenwich was designed by Mr. Brooke, and another ingenious\r\ninstrument of this kind has been invented by Mr. F. Ronalds, of the Richmond\r\nObservatory.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this disturbance attains a great degree of intensity, the equilibrium\r\nof the distribution is restored by a discharge attended by a development of\r\nlight \"The Aurora* itself is, therefore, not to be regarded as an externally\r\nmanifested cause of this disturbance, but rather as a result of telluric\r\nactivity, manifested on the one side by the appearance of the light, and on\r\nthe other by the vibrations of the magnetic needle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dove, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xx., s. 341; bd. xix., s.\r\n388.  \"The declination needle acts in very nearly the same way as an\r\natmospheric electrometer, whose divergence in like manner shows the\r\nincreased tension of the electricity before this has become so great as to\r\nyield a spark.\"  See also, the excellent observations of Professor Käwmtz,\r\nin his 'Lehrbuch der Meteorologie', bd. iii., s. 511-519, and Sir David\r\nBrewster, in his 'Treatise on Magnetism', p. 280.  Regarding the magnetic\r\nproperties of the galvanic flame, or luminous arch from a Bunsen's carbon\r\nand zinc battery, see Casselmann's 'Beobachtungen' (Marburg, 1844), s. 56-62.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe splendid appearance of colored polar light is the act of discharge, the\r\ntermination of a magnetic storm, as in an electrical storm a development of\r\nlight -- the flash of lightning -- indicates the restoration of the\r\ndisturbed equilibrium in the distribution of the electricity.  An electric\r\nstorm is generally confined to a small space beyond the limits of which the\r\ncondition of the atmospheric electricity remains unchanged.  A magnetic\r\nstorm, on the other hand,\r\np 193\r\nshows its influence on the course of the needle over large portions of\r\ncontinents, and, as Arago first discovered far from the spot where the\r\nevolution of light was visible.  It is not improbable that, as\r\nheavily-charged threatening clouds, owing to frequent transitions of the\r\natmospheric electricity to an opposite condition, are not always discharged,\r\naccompanied by lightning, so likewise magnetic storms may occasion\r\nfar-extending disturbances in the horary course of the needle, without there\r\nbeing any positive necessity that the equilibrium of the distribution should\r\nbe restored by explosion, or by the passage of luminous effusions from one\r\nof the poles to the equator, or from pole to pole.\r\n\r\nIn collecting all the individual features of the phenomenon in one general\r\npicture, we must not omit to describe the origin and course of a perfectly\r\ndeveloped Aurora Borealis.  Low down in the distant horizon, about the part\r\nof the heavens which is intersected by the magnetic meridian, the sky which\r\nwas previously clear is at once overcast.  A dense wall of bank of cloud\r\nseems to rise gradually higher and higher, until it attains an elevation of\r\n8 or 10 degrees.  The color of the dark segment passes into  brown or\r\nviolet; and stars are visible through the cloudy stratum, as when a dense\r\nsmoke darkens the sky.  A broad, brightly-luminous arch, first white, then\r\nyellow, encircles the dark segment; but as the brilliant arch appears\r\nsubsequently to the smoky gray segment, we can not agree with Argelander in\r\nascribing the latter to the effect of mere contrast with the bright luminous\r\nmargin.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Argelander, in the important observations on the northern light\r\nembodied in the 'Vorträgen gehalten in der physikalish-okonomischen\r\nGessellschaft zu Konigsberg', bd. i., 1834, s. 257-264.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highest point of the arch of light is, according to accurate\r\nobservations made on the subject,* not generally in the magnetic meridian\r\nitself, but from 5 degrees to 18 degrees toward the direction of the\r\nmagnetic declination of the place.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *For an account of the results of the observations of Lottin,\r\nBravais, and Siljerstrom, who spent a winter at Bosekop, on the coast of\r\nLapland (70 degrees N. lat.), and in 210 nights saw the northern lights 160\r\ntimes, see the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences', t. x., p. 289, and\r\nMartins's 'Meteorologie', 1843, p. 453.  See also, Argelander in the\r\n'Vortragen geh. in der Konigsberg Gessellschaft', bd. i., s. 259.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **[Professor Challis of Cambridge, states that in the Aurora of\r\nOctober 24th, 1847, the streamers all converged toward a single point of the\r\nheavens, situated in or very near a vertical circle passing through the\r\nmagnetic pole.  Around this point a corona was formed, the rays of which\r\ndiverged in all directions from the center, leaving a space free from light:\r\n its azimuth was 18 degrees 41' from south to east, and its altitude 69\r\ndegrees 54'.  See Professor Challis, in the 'Athenaeum', Oct. 31, 1847.] --\r\nTr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the northern latitudes,\r\np 196\r\nin the immediate vicinity of the magnetic pole, the smoke-like conical\r\nsegment appears less dark, and sometimes is not even seen.  Where the\r\nhorizontal force is the weakest, the middle of the luminous arch deviates\r\nthe most from the magnetic meridian.\r\n\r\nThe luminous arch remains sometimes for hours together flashing and kindling\r\nin ever-varying undulations, before rays and streamers emanate from it, and\r\nshoot up to the zenith.  The more intense the discharges of the northern\r\nlight, the more bright is the play of colors, through all the varying\r\ngradations from violet and bluish white to green and crimson.  Even in\r\nordinary electricity excited by friction, the sparks are only colored in\r\ncases where the explosion is very violent after great tension.  The magnetic\r\ncolumns of flame rise eithr singly from the luminous arch, blended with\r\nblack rays similar to thick smoke, or simultaneously in many opposite points\r\nof the horizon, uniting together to torm a flickering sea of flame, whose\r\nbrilliant beauty admits of no adequate description, as the luminous waves\r\nare every moment assuming new and varying forms.  The intensity of this\r\nlight is at times so great, that Lowenorn (on the 29th of June, 1786)\r\nrecognized the coruscation of the polar light n bright sunshine.  Motion\r\nrenders the phenomenon more visible.  Round the point in the vault of heaven\r\nwhich corresponds to the direction of the inclination of the needle, the\r\nbeams unite together to form the so-called corona, the crown of the northern\r\nlight, which encircles the summit of the heavenly canopy with a milder\r\nradiance and unflickering emanations of light.  It is only in rare instances\r\nthat a perfect crown or circle is formed, but on its completion the\r\nphenomenon has invariably reached its maximum, and the radiations become\r\nless frequent, shorter, and more colorless.  The crown and the luminous\r\narches break up, and the whole vault of heaven becomes covered with\r\nirregularly-scattered, broad, faint, almost ashy-gray luminous immovable\r\npatches, which in their turn disappear, leaving nothing but a trace of the\r\ndark, smoke-like segment on the horizon.  There often remains nothing of the\r\nwhole spectacle but a white, delicate cloud with feathery edges, or divided\r\nat equal distances into small roundish groups like cirio-cumuli.\r\n\r\nThis connection of the polar light with the most delicate cirrous clouds\r\ndeserves special attention, because it shows that the electro-magnetic\r\nevolution of light is a part of a meteorological process.  Terrestrial\r\nmagnetism here manifests its influence\r\np 197\r\non the atmosphere and on the condensation of aqueous vapor.  The fleecy\r\nclouds seen in Iceland by Thienemann, and which he considered to be the\r\nnorthern light, have been seen in recent times by Franklin and Richardson\r\nnear the American north pole, and by Admiral Wrangel on the Siberian coast\r\nof the Polar Sea.  All remarked \"that the Aurora flashed forth in the most\r\nvivid beams when masses of cirrous strata were hovering in the upper regions\r\nof the air, and when these were so thin that their presence could only be\r\nrecognized by the formation of a halo round the moon.\"  These clouds\r\nsometimes range themselves, even by day in a similar manner to the beams of\r\nthe Aurora, and then disturb the course of the magnetic needle in the same\r\nmanner as the latter.  On the morning after every distinct nocturnal Aurora,\r\nthe same superimposed strata of clouds have still been observed that had\r\npreviously been luminous.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *John Franklin, 'Narrative of a Journey to the Shores of the\r\nPolar Sea, in the Years 1819-1822', p. 552 and 597; Thienemann in the\r\n'Edinburgh Philosophical Journal', vol. xx., p. 336; Farquharson, in vol.\r\nvi., p. 392, of the same journal; Wrangel, 'Phys. Beob.', s. 59.  Parry even\r\nsaw the great arch of the northern light continue throughout the day.\r\n('Journal of the Royal Institution of Great Britain', 1828, Jan., p. 429.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparently converging polar zones (streaks of clouds in the direction of\r\nthe magnetic meridian), which constantly occupied my attention during my\r\njourneys on the elevated plateaux of Mexico and in Northern Asia, belong\r\nprobably to the same group of ciurnal phenomena.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On my return from my American travels, I described the delicate\r\ncirro-cumulus cloud, which appears uniformly divided, as if by the action of\r\nrepulsive forces, under the name of polar bands ('bandes polaires'), because\r\ntheir perspective point of convergence is mostly at first in the magnetic\r\npole, so that the parallel rows of fleecy clouds follow the magnetic\r\nmeridian.  One peculiarity of this mysterious phenomenon is the oscillation,\r\nor occasionally the gradually progressive motion, of the point of\r\nconvergence.  It is usually observed that the bands are only fully developed\r\nin one region of the heavens, and they are seen to move first from south to\r\nnorth, and then gradually from east to west.  I could not trace any\r\nconnection between the advancing motion of the bands and alterations of the\r\ncurrents of air in the higher regions of the atmosphere.  They occur when\r\nthe air is extremely calm and the heavens are quite serene, and are much\r\nmore common under the tropics than in the temperate and frigid zones.  I\r\nhave seen this phenomenon on the Andes, almost under the equator, at an\r\nelevation of 15,920 feet, and in Northern Asia, in the plains of\r\nKrasnojarski, south of Buchtarminsk, so similarly developed, that we must\r\nregard the influences producing it as very widely distributed, and as\r\ndepending on general natural forces.  See the important observations of\r\nKamtz ('Vorlesungen uber Meteorologie', 1840, s. 146), and the more recent\r\nones of Martins and Bravais ('Meteorologie', 1843, p. 117).  In south polar\r\nbands, composed of very delicate clouds, observed by Arqago at Paris on the\r\n23d of June, 1844, dark rays shot upward from an arch running east and west.\r\n We have already made mention of black rays, resembling dark smoke, as\r\noccurring in brilliant nocturnal northern lights.\r\n\r\n\r\np 198\r\nSouthern lights have often been seen in England by the intelligent and\r\nindefatigable observer Dalton and northern lights have been observed in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere as far as 45 degrees latitude (as on the 14th of\r\nJanuary, 1831).  On occasions that are by no means of rare occurrence, the\r\nequilibrium at both poles has been simultaneously disturbed.  I have\r\ndiscovered with certainty that northern polar lights have been seen within\r\nthe tropics in Mexico and Peru.  We must distinguish between the sphere of\r\nsimultaneous visibility of the phenomenon and the zones of the Earth where\r\nit is seen almost nightly.  Every observer no doubt sees a separate Aurora\r\nof his own, as he sees a separate rainbow.  A great portion of the Earth\r\nsimultaneously engenders these phenomena of emanations of light.  Many\r\nnights may be instanced in which the phenomenon has been simultaneously\r\nobserved in England and in Pennsylvania, in Rome and in Pekin.  When it is\r\nstated that Auroras diminish with the decrease of latitude, the latitude\r\nmust be understood to be magnetic, and as measured by its distance from the\r\nmagnetic pole.  In Iceland, in Greenland, Newfoundland, on the shores of the\r\nSlave Lake, and at Fort Enterprise in Northern Canada, these lights appear\r\nalmost every night at certain seasons of the year, celebrating with their\r\nflashing beams, according to the mode of expression common to the\r\ninhabitants of the Shetland Isles, \"a merry dance in heaven.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The northrn lights are called by the Shetland Islanders \"the\r\nmerry dancers.\"  (Kendal, in the 'Quarterly Journal of Science', new series,\r\nvol. iv., p. 395.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Aurora is a phenomenon of rare occurrence in Italy, it is\r\nfrequently seen in the latitude of Philadelphia (39 degrees 57'), owing to\r\nthe southern position of the American nagnetic pole.  In the districts which\r\nare remarkable, in the New Continent and the Siberian coasts, for the\r\nfrequent occurrence of this phenomenon, there are special regions or zones\r\nof longitude in which the polar light is particularly bright and brilliant.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Muncke's excellent work in the new edition of Gehler's\r\n'Physik Worterbuch', bd. vii., i., s 113-268, and especially s. 158.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence\r\np 199\r\nof local influences can not, therefore, be denied in these cases.  Wrangel\r\nsaw the brilliancy diminish as he left the shores of the Polar Sea, about\r\nMischne-Kolymsk.  The observations made in the North Polar expedition appear\r\nto prove that in the immediate vicinity of the magnetic pole the development\r\nof light is not in the least degree more intense or frequent than at some\r\ndistance from it.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge which we at present possess of the altitude of the polar light\r\nis based on measurements which from their nature, the constant oscillation\r\nof the phenomenon of light, and the consequent uncertainty of the angle of\r\nparallax, are not deserving of much confidence.  The results obtained,\r\nsetting aside the older data, fluctuate between several miles and an\r\nelevation of 3000 or 4000 feet; and, in all probability, the northern lights\r\nat different times occur at very different elevations.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Farquharson in the 'Edinburgh Philos. Journal', vol. xvi., p.\r\n304; 'Philos. Transact.' for 1829, p. 113.\r\n[The height of the bow of light of the Aurora seen at the Cambridge\r\nObservatory, March 19, 1847, was determined by Professors Challis, of\r\nCambridge, and Chevallier, of Durham, to be 177 miles above the surface of\r\nthe Earth.  See the notice of this meteor in 'An Account of the Aurora\r\nBorealis of Oct. 24, 1847', by John H. Morgan, Esq., 1848.] -- Tr.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most recent observers are disposed to place the phenomenon in the region\r\nof clouds, and not on the confines of the atmosphere; and they even believe\r\nthat the rays of the Aurora may be affected by winds and currents of air, if\r\nthe phenomenon of light, by which alone the existence of an electro-magnetic\r\ncurrent is appreciable, be actually connected with matrial groups of\r\nvesicles of vapor in motion, or, more correctly speaking, if light penetrate\r\nthem, passing from one vesicle to another.  Franklin saw near Great Bear\r\nLake a beaming northern light, the lower side of which he thought\r\nilluminated a stratum of clouds, while, at a distance of only eighteen\r\ngeographical miles, Kendal, who was on watch throughout the whole night, and\r\nnever lost sight of the sky, perceived no phenomenon of light.  The\r\nassertion, so frequently maintained of late, that the rays of the Aurora\r\nhave been seen to shoot down to the ground between the spectator and some\r\nneighboring hill, is open to the charge of optical delusion, as in the cases\r\nof strokes of lightning or of the fall of fire-balls.\r\n\r\nWhether the magnetic storms, whose local character we have illustrated by\r\nsuch remarkable examples, share noise as well as light in common with\r\nelectric storms, is a question\r\np 200\r\nthat has become difficult to answer, since implicit confidence is no longr\r\nyielded to the relations of Greenland whale-fishers and Siberian\r\nfox-hunters.  Northern lights appear to have become less noisy since their\r\noccurrences have been more accurately recorded.  Parry, Franklin, and\r\nRichardson, near the north pole; Thienemann in Iceland; Gieseke in\r\nGreenland; Lotur, and Bravais, near the North Cape; Wrangel and Anjou, on\r\nthe coast of the Polar Sea, have together seen the Aurora thousands of\r\ntimes, but never heard any sound attending the phenomenon.  If this negative\r\ntestimony should not be deemed equivalent to the positive counter-evidence\r\nof Hearne on the mouth of the Copper River and of Henderson in Iceland, it\r\nmust be remembered that, although Hood heard a noise as of quickly-moved\r\nmusket-balls and a slight cracking sound during an Aurora, he also noticed\r\nthe same noise on the following day, when there was no northern light to be\r\nseen; and it must not be forgotten that Wrangel and Gieseke were fully\r\nconvinced that the sound they had heard was to be ascribed to the\r\ncontraction of the ice and the crust of the snow on the sudden cooling of\r\nthe atmosphere.  The belief in a crackling sound has arisen, not among the\r\npeople generally, but rather among learned travelers, because in earlier\r\ntimes the northern light was declared to be an effect of atmospheric\r\nelectricity, on account of the luminous manifestation of the electricity in\r\nrarefied space, and the observers found it easy to hear what they wished to\r\nhear.  Recent experiments with very sensitive electrometers have hitherto,\r\ncontrary to the expectation generally entertained, yielded only negative\r\nresults.  The condition of the electricity in the atmosphere*\r\np 291\r\nis not found to be changed during the most intense Aurora; but, on the other\r\nhand, the three expressions of the power of terrestrial magnetism,\r\ndeclination, inclination and intensity, are all affected by polar light, so\r\nthat in the same night, and at different periods of the magnetic\r\ndevelopment, the same end of the needle is both attracted and repelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[Mr. James Glaisher, of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in\r\nhis interesting 'Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending December\r\n31st, 1847', says, \"It is a fact well worthy of notice, that from the\r\nbeginning of this quarter till the 29th of December, the electricity of the\r\natmosphere was almost always in a neutral state, so that no signs of\r\nelectricity were shown for several days together by any of the electrical\r\ninstruments.\"  During this period there were 'eight' exhibitions of the\r\nAurora Borealis, of which one was the peculiarly bright display of the\r\nAurora Borealis, of which one was the peculiarly bright display of the\r\nmeteor on the 24th of October.  These frequent exhibitions of brilliant\r\nAurorae seem to depend upon many remarkable meteorological relations, for we\r\nfind, according to Mr. Glaisher's statement in the paper to which we have\r\nalready alluded, that the previous fifty years afford no parallel season to\r\nthe closing one of 1847.  The mean temperature of evaporation and of the dew\r\npoint, the mean elastic force of vapor, the mean reading of the barometer,\r\nand the mean daily range of the readings of the thermometers in air, were\r\nall greater at Greenwich during that season of 1847 than the average range\r\nof many preceding years.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assertion made by Parry, on the strength of the data yielded by his\r\nobservations in the neighborhood of the magnetic pole at Melville Island,\r\nthat the Aurora did not disturb, but rather exercised a calming influence on\r\nthe magnetic needle, has been satisfactorily refuted by Parry's own more\r\nexact researches,* detailed in his journal, and by the admirable\r\nobservations of Richardson, Hood, and Franklin in Northern Canada, and\r\nlastly by Bravais and Lottin in Lapland.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Kamtz, 'Lehrbuch der Meteorologie', bd. iii., s. 498 and 501.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process of the Aurora is, as has already been observed, the restoration\r\nof a disturbed condition of equilibrium.  The effect on the needle is\r\ndifferent according to the degree of intensity of the explosion.  It was\r\nonly unappreciable at the gloomy winter station of  Bosekop when the\r\nphenomenon of light was very faint and aptly compared to the flame which\r\nrises in the closed circuit of a voltaic pile between two points of carbon\r\nat a considerable distance apart, or, according to Fizeau, to the flame\r\nrising between a silver and a carbon point, and attracted or repelled by the\r\nmagnet.  This analogy certainly sets aside the necessity of assuming the\r\nexistence of metallic vapors in the atmosphere, which some celebrated\r\nphysicists have regarded as the substratum of the northern light.\r\n\r\nWhen we apply the indefinite term 'polar light' to the luminous phenomenon\r\nwhich we ascribe to a galvanic current, that is to say, to the motion of\r\nelectricity in a closed circuit, we merely indicate the local direction in\r\nwhich the evolution of light is most frequently, although by no means\r\ninvariably, seen.  This phenomenon derives the greater part of its\r\nimportance from the fact that the Earth becomes 'self-luminous', and that as\r\na planet, besides the light which it receives from the central body, the\r\nSun, it shows itself capable in itself of developing light.  The intensity\r\nof the terrestrial light, or, rather the luminosity which is diffused,\r\nexceeds, in cases of the brightest colored radiation toward the zenith, the\r\nlight of the Moon in its first quarter.  Occasionally, as on the 7th of\r\nJanuary, 1831, printed characters could be read without difficulty.  This\r\nalmost uninterrupted development of light\r\np 202\r\nin the Earth leads us by analogy to the remarkable process exhibited in\r\nVenus.  The portion of this planet which is not illumined by the Sun often\r\nshines with a phosphorescent light of its own.  It is not improbable that\r\nthe Moon, Jupiter, and the comets shine with an independent light, besides\r\nthe reflected solar light visible through the polariscope.  Without speaking\r\nof the problematical but yet ordinary mode in which the sky is illuminated,\r\nwhen a low cloud may be seen to shine with an uninterrupted flickering light\r\nfor many minutes together, we still meet with other instances of terrestrial\r\ndevelopment of light in our atmosphere.  In this category we may reckon the\r\ncelebrated luminous mists seen in 1783 and 1831; the steady luminous\r\nappearance exhibited without any flickeriing in great clouds observed by\r\nRozier and Beccaria; and lastly, as Arago* well remarks, the faint diffused\r\nlight which guides the steps of the traveler in cloudy, starless, and\r\nmoonless nights in autumn and winter, even when there is no snow on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, on the dry fogs of 1783 and 1831, which illuminated the\r\nnight, in the 'Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes', 1832, p. 246 and 250;\r\nand, regarding extraordinary luminous appearances in clouds without storms,\r\nsee 'Notices sur la Tonnerre', in the 'Annuaire pour l'an. 1838', p. 279-285.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in polar light or the electro-magnetic storm, a current of brilliant and\r\noften colored light streams through the atmosphere in high latitudes, so\r\nalso in the torrid zones between the tropics, the ocean simultaneously\r\ndevelops light over a space of many thousand square miles.  Here the magical\r\neffect of light is owing to the forces of organic nature.  Foaming with\r\nlight, the eddying waves flash in phosphorescent sparks over the wide\r\nexpanse of waters, where every scintillation is the vital manifestation of\r\nan invisible animal world.  So varied are the sources of terrestrial light!\r\nMust we still suppose this light to be latent, and combined in vapors, in\r\norder to explain 'Moser's images produced at a distance' -- a discovery in\r\nwhich reality has hitherto manifested itself like a mere phantom of the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nAs the internal heat of our planet is connected on the one hand with the\r\ngeneration of electro-magnetic currents and the process of terrestrial light\r\n(a consequence of the magnetic storm), it, on the other hand, discloses to\r\nus the chief source of geognostic phenomena.  We shall consider these in\r\ntheir connection with and their transition from merely dynamic disturbances,\r\nfrom the elevation of whole continents and mountain chains to the\r\ndevelopment and effusion of gaseous and\r\np 203\r\nliquid fluids, of hot mud, and of those heated and molten earths which\r\nbecome solidified into crystalline mineral masses.  Modern geognosy, the\r\nmineral portion of terrestrial physics, has made no slight advance in having\r\ninvestigated this connection of phenomena.  This investigation has led us\r\naway from the delusive hypothesis, by which it was customary formerly to\r\nendeavor to explain, individually every expression of force in the\r\nterrestrial globe:  it shows us the connection of the occurrence of\r\nheterogeneous substances with that which only appertains to changes in space\r\n(disturbances or elevations), and groups together phenomena which at first\r\nsight appeared most heterogeneous, as thermal springs, effusion of carbonic\r\nacid and sulphurous vapor, innocuous salses (mud eruptions), and the\r\ndreadful devastation of volcanic mountains.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[See Mantell's 'Wonders of Geology', 1848, vol. i., p. 34, 36,\r\n105; also Lyell's 'Principles of Geology', vol. ii., and Daubeney 'On\r\nVolcanoes', 2d ed., 1848, Part ii., ch. xxxii., xxxiii.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a general view of nature, all these phenomena are fused together in one\r\nsole idea of the reaction of the interior of a planet on its external\r\nsurface.  We thus recognize in the depths of the earth, and in the increase\r\nof temperature with the increase of depth from the surface, not only the\r\ngerm of disturbing movements, but also of the gradual elevation of whole\r\ncontinents (as mountain chains on long fissures), of volcanic eruptions, and\r\nof the manifold production of mountains and mineral masses.  The influence\r\nof this reaction of the interior on the exterior is not, however, limited to\r\ninorganic nature alone.  It is highly probable that, in an earlier world,\r\nmore powerful emanations of carbonic acid gas, blended with the atmosphere,\r\nmust have increased the assimilation of carbon in vegetables, and that an\r\ninexhaustible supply of combustible matter (lignites and carboniferous\r\nformations) must have been thus buried in the upper strata of the earth by\r\nthe revolutions attending the destruction of vast tracts of forest.  We\r\nlikewise perceive that the destiny of mankind is in part dependent on the\r\nformation of the external surface of the earth, the direction of mountain\r\ntracts and high lands, and on the distribution of elevated continents.  It\r\nis thus granted to the inquiring mind to pass from link to link along the\r\nchain of phenomena until it reaches the period when, in the solidifying\r\nprocess of our planet, and in its first transition from the gaseous form to\r\nthe agglomeration of matter, that portion of the inner heat of the Earth was\r\ndeveloped, which does not belong to the action of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThis material taken from pages 204-248\r\n\r\nCOSMOS: A Sketch of the Physical Description of the Universe, Vol. 1\r\nby Alexander von Humboldt\r\n\r\nTranslated by E C Otte\r\n\r\nfrom the 1858 Harper & Brothers edition of Cosmos, volume 1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\np 204\r\nIn order to give a general delineation of the causal connection of\r\ngeognostical phenomena, we will begin with those whose chief characteristic\r\nis dynamic, consisting in motion and in change in space.  Earthquakes\r\nmanifest themselves by quick and successive vertical, or horizontal, or\r\nrotatory vibrations.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[See Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', 2d ed., 1848, p. 509.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very considerable number of earthquakes which I have experienced in\r\nboth hemispheres, alike on land and at sea, the two first-named kinds of\r\nmotion have often appeared to me to occur simultaneously.  The mine-like\r\nexplosiion -- the vertical action from below upward -- was most strikingly\r\nmanifested in the overthrow of the town of Riobamba in 1797, when the bodies\r\nof many of the inhabitants were found to have been hurled to Cullea, a hill\r\nseveral hundred feet in neight, and on the opposite side of the River Lican.\r\n The propagation is most generally effected by undulations in a linear\r\ndirection,* with a velocity of from twenty to twenty-eight miles in a\r\nminute, but partly in circles of commotion or large ellipses, in which the\r\nvibrations are propagated with decreasing intensity from a center toward the\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[On the linear direction of earthquakes, see Daubeney 'On\r\nVolcanoes', p. 515.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are districts exposed to the action of two intersecting circles of\r\ncommotion.  In Northern Asia, where the Father of History,* and subsequently\r\nTheophylactus Simocatta,** described the districts of Scythia as free from\r\nearthquakes, I have observed the metalliferous portion of the Altai\r\nMountains under the influence of a two-fold focus of commotion, the Lake of\r\nBaikal, and the volcano of the Celestial Mountain (Thianschan).***\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Herod, iv., 28.  The prostration of the colossal statue of\r\nMemnon, which has been again restored (Letronne, 'La Statue Vocale de\r\nMemnon', 1835, p. 25, 26), presents a fact in opposition to the ancient\r\nprejudice that Egypt is free from earthquakes (Pliny, ii., 80); but the\r\nvalley of the Nile does lie external to the circle of commotion of\r\nByzantium, the Archipelago, and Syria (Ideler ad Aristot., 'Meteor.', p.\r\n584).\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **Saint-Martin, in the learned notes to Lebeau, 'Hist. du Bas\r\nEmpire', t. ix., p. 401.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ***Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 110-118.  In regard to\r\nthe difference between agitation of the surface and of the strata lying\r\nbeneath it, see Gay-Lussac, in the 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique', t.\r\nxxii., p. 429.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the circles of commotion intersect one another -- when, for instance,\r\nan elevated plain lies between two volcanoes simultaneously in a state of\r\neruption, several wave-systems may exist together, as in fluids, and not\r\nmutually disturb one another.  We may even suppose 'interference'\r\np 205\r\nto exist here, as in the intersecting waves of sound.  The extent of the\r\npropagated waves of commotion will be increased on the upper surface of the\r\nearth, according to the general law of mechanics, by which, on the\r\ntransmission of motion in elastic bodies, the stratum lying free on the one\r\nside endeavors to separate itself from the other strata.\r\n\r\nWaves of commotion have been investigated by means of the pendulum and the\r\nseismometer* with tolerable accuracy in respect to their direction and total\r\nintensity, but by no means with reference to the internal nature of their\r\nalternations and their periodic intumescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[This instrument, in its simplest form, consists merely of a\r\nbasin filled with some viscid liquid, which, on the occurrence of a shock of\r\nan earthquake of sufficient force to disturb the equilibrium of the building\r\nin which it is placed, is tilted on one side, and the liquid made to rise in\r\nthe same direction, thus showing by its height the degree of the\r\ndisturbance.  Professor J. Forbes has invented an instrument of this nature,\r\nalthough on a greatly improved plan.  It consists of a vertical metal rod,\r\nhaving a ball of lead movable upon it.  It is supported upon a cylindrical\r\nsteel wire, which may be compressed at pleasure by means of a screw.  A\r\nlateral movement, such as that of an earthquake, which carries forward the\r\nbase of the instrument, can only act upon the ball through the medium of the\r\nelasticity of the wire, and the direction of the displacement will be\r\nindicated by the plane of vibration of the pendulum.  A self-registering\r\napparatus is attached to the machine.  See Professor J. Forbes's account of\r\nhis invention in 'Edinb. Phil. Trans.', vol. xv., Part i.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the city of Quito, which lies at the foot of a still active volcano (the\r\nRucu Pichincha), and at an elevation of 9540 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, which has beautiful cupolas, high vaulted churches, and massive\r\nedifices of several stories, I have often been astonished that the violence\r\nof the nocturnal earthquakes so seldom causes fissures in the walls, while\r\nin the Peruvian plains oscillations apparently much less intense injure low\r\nreed cottages.  The natives, who have experienced many hundred earthquakes,\r\nbelieve that the difference depends less upon the length or shortness of the\r\nwaves, and the slowness or rapidity of the horizontal vibrations.* than on\r\nthe uniformity of the motion in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *  \"Tutissimum est cum vibrat crispante Aedificiorum crepitu; et\r\ncum intumescit assurgens alternoque motu residet, innoxium et cum\r\nconcurrentia tecta contrario ictu arietant; quoniam alter motus alteri\r\nrenititur.

Walls were observed to be twisted, but not thrown\r\ndown; rows of trees turned from their previous parallel direction;\r\np 206\r\nand fields covered with different kinds of plants found to be displaced in\r\nthe great earthquake of Riobamba, in the province of Quito, on the 4th of\r\nFebruary, 1797, and in that of Calabria, between the 5th of February and the\r\n28th of March, 1782.  The phenomenon of the inversion or displacement of\r\nfields and pieces of land, by which one is made to occupy the place of\r\nanother, is connected with a translatory motion or penetration of separate\r\nterrestrial strata.  When I made the plan of the ruined town of Riobamba,\r\none particular spot was pointed out to me, where all the furniture of one\r\nhouse had been found under the ruins of another.  The loose earth had\r\nevidently moved like a fluid in currents, which must be assumed to have been\r\ndirected first downward, then horizontally, and lastly upward.  It was found\r\nnecessary to appeal to the 'Audiencia', or Council of Justice, to decide\r\nupon the contentions that arose regarding the proprietorship of objects that\r\nhad been removed to a distance of many hundred roises.\r\n\r\nIn countries where earthquakes are comparatively of much less frequent\r\noccurrence (as for instance, in Southern Europe), a very general belief\r\nprevails, although unsupported by the authority of inductive reasoning,*\r\nthat a calm, an oppressive\r\np 207\r\nheat and a misty horizon, are always the forerunners of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Even in Italy they have begun to observe that earthquakes are\r\nunconnected with the state of the weather, that is to say, with the\r\nappearance of the heavens immediately before the shock.  The numerical\r\nresults of Friedrich Hoffmann ('Hinterlassene Werke', bd. ii., 366-376)\r\nexactly correspond with the experience of the Abbate Scina of Palermo.  I\r\nhave myself several times observed reddish clouds on the day of an\r\nearthquake, and shortly before it on the 4th of November, 1799, I\r\nexperienced two sharp shocks at the moment of a loud clap of thunder.\r\n('Relat. Hist.', liv. iv., chap. 10.)  The Turin physicist, Vassalli Eaudi,\r\nobserved Volta's electrometer to be strongly agitated during the protracted\r\nearthquake of Pignerol, which lasted from the 2d of April to the 17th of\r\nMay, 1808; 'Journal de Physique', t. lxvii., p. 291.  But these indications\r\npresented by clouds, by modifications of atmospheric electricity, or by\r\ncalms, can not be regarded as 'generally' or 'necessarily' connected with\r\nearthquakes, since in Quito, Peru, and Chili, as well as in Canada and\r\nItaly, many earthquakes are observed along with the purest and clearest\r\nskies, and with the freshest land and sea breezes.  But if no meteorological\r\nphenomenon indicates the coming earthquake either on the morning of the\r\nshock or a few days previously, the influence of certain periods of the year\r\n(the vernal and autumnal equinoxes), the commencement of the rainy season in\r\nthe tropics after long drought, and the change of the monsoons (according to\r\ngeneral belief), can not be overlooked, even though the genetic connection\r\nof meteorological processes with those going on in the interior of our globe\r\nis still enveloped in obscurity.  Numerical inquiries on the distribution of\r\nearthquakes throughout the course of the year, such as those of Von Hoff,\r\nPeter Merian, and Friedrich Hoffmann, bear testimony to their frequency at\r\nthe periods of equinoxes.  It is singular that Pliny, at the end of his\r\nfanciful theory of earthquakes, names the entire frightful phenomenon a\r\nsubterranean storm; not so much in consequence of the rolling sound which\r\nfrequently accompanies the shock, as because the elastic forces, concussive\r\nby their tension, accumulate in the interior of the earth when they are\r\nabsent in the atmosphere!  \"Ventos in causa esse non dubium reor.  Neque\r\nenim unquam intemiscunt terre, nisi sopito mari, coeloque adeo tranquillo,\r\nut volatus avium non pendeant, subtracto omni spiritu qui vehit; nec unquam\r\nnisi post ventos conditos, scilicet in venas et cavernas ejus occulto\r\nafflatu.  Neque aliad est in terra tremor, quam in nube toonitruum; nec\r\nhiatus aliud quam cum fulmen erumpit, incluso spiritu luctante et ad\r\nlibertatem exire nitente.\"  (Plin., ii., 79.)  The germs of almost every\r\nthing that has been observed of imagined on the causes of earthquakes, up to\r\nthe present day, may be found in Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest.', vi., 4-31.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fallacy of this popular opinion is not only refuted by my own\r\nexperience, but likewise by the observations of all those who have lived\r\nmany years in districts where, as in Cumana, Quito, Peru, and Chili, the\r\nearth is frequently and violently agitated.  I have felt earthquakes in\r\nclear air and a fresh east wind, as well as in rain and thunder storms.  The\r\nregularity of the horary changes in the declination of the magnetic needle\r\nand in the atmospheric pressure remained undisturbed between the tropics on\r\nthe days when earthquakes occurred.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *I have given proof that the course of the horary variations of\r\nthe barometer is not affected before or after earthquakes, in my 'Relat.\r\nHist.', t. i., p. 311 and 513.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese facts agree with the observations made by Adolph Erman (in the\r\ntemperate zone, on the 8th of March, 1829) on the occasion of an earthquake\r\nat Irkutsk, near the Lake of Baikal.  During the violent earthquake of\r\nCumana, on the 4th of November, 1799, I found the declination and the\r\nintensity of the magnetic force alike unchanged, but, to my surprise, the\r\ninclination of the needle was diminished about 48 degrees.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnonte]  *Humboldt, 'Relat. Hist.', t. i., p. 515-517.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no ground to suspect an error in the calculation, and yet, in the\r\nmany other earthquakes which I have experienced on the elevated plateaux of\r\nQuito and Lima, the inclination as well as the other elements of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism remained always unchanged.  Although, in general, the processes at\r\nwork within the interior of the earth may not be announced by any\r\nmeteorological phenomena or any special appearance of the sky, it is, on the\r\ncontrary, not improbable, as we shall soon see, that in cases of violent\r\nearthquakes some effect may be imparted to the atmosphere, in consequence of\r\nwhich they can not always act in a purely dynamic manner.\r\n\r\np 208\r\nDuring the long-continued trembling of the ground in the Piedmontese valleys\r\nof Pelis and Clusson, the greatest changes in the electric tension of the\r\natmosphere were observed while the sky was cloudless.  The intensity of the\r\nhollow noise which generally accompanies an earthquake does not increase in\r\nthe same degree as the force of the oscillations.  I have ascertained with\r\ncertainty that the great shock of the earthquake of Riobamba (4th Feb.,\r\n1797) -- one of the most fearful phenomena recorded in the physical history\r\nof our planet -- was not accompanied by any noise whatever.  The tremendous\r\nnoise ('el gram ruido') which was heard below the soil of the cities of\r\nQuito and Ibarra, but not at Tacunga and Hambato, nearer the center of the\r\nmotion, occurred between eighteen and twenty minutes 'after' the actual\r\ncatastrophe.  In the celebrated earthquake of Lima and Callao (28th of\r\nOctober, 1746), a noise resembling a subterranean thunder-clap was heard at\r\nTruxillo a quarter of an hour after the shock, and unaccompanied by any\r\ntrembling of the ground.  In like manner, long after the great earthquake in\r\nNew Granada, on the 16th of November, 1827, described by Boussingault,\r\nsubterranean detonations were heard in the whole valley of Cauca during\r\ntwenty or thirty seconds, unattended by motion.  The nature of the noise\r\nvaries also very much, being either rolling, or rustling, or clanking like\r\nchains when moved, or like near thunder, as, for instance, in the city of\r\nQuito; or, lastly, clear and ringing, as if obsidian or some other vitrified\r\nmasses were struck in subterranean cavities.  As solid bodies are excellent\r\nconductors of sound, which is propagated in burned clay, for instance, ten\r\nor twelve times quicker than in the air, the subterranean noise may be heard\r\nat a great distance from the place where it has originated.  In Caracas, in\r\nthe grassy plains of Calabozo, and on the banks of the Rio Apure, which\r\nfalls into the Orinoco, a tremendously loud noise, resembling thunder, was\r\nheard, unaccompanied by an earthquake, over a district of land 9200 square\r\nmiles in extent, on the 30th of April, 1812, while at a distance of 632\r\nmiles to the north-east, the volcano of St. Vincent, in the small Antilles,\r\npoured forth a copious stream of lava.  With respect to distance, this was\r\nas if an eruption of Vesuvius had been heard in the north of France.  In the\r\nyear 1744, on the great eruption of the volcano of Cotopaxi, subterranean\r\nnoises, resembling the discharge of cannon, were heard in Honda, on the\r\nMagdalena River.  The crater of Cotopaxi lies not only 18,000 feet higher\r\nthan Honda, but these two points are separated by the colossal\r\np 209\r\nmountain chain of Quito, Pasto, and Popayan, no less than by numerous\r\nvalleys and clefts, and they are 436 miles apart.  The sound was certainly\r\nnot propagated through the air, but through the earth, and at a great depth.\r\n During the violent earthquake of New Granada, in February, 1835,\r\nsubterranean thunder was heard simultaneously at Popayan, Bogota, Santa\r\nMarta, and Caracas (where it continued for seven hours without any movement\r\nof the ground), in Haiti, Jamaica, and on the Lake of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena of sound, when unattended by any perceptible shocks, produce\r\na peculiarly deep impression even on persons who have lived in countries\r\nwhere the earth has been frequently exposed to shocks.  A striking and\r\nunparalleled instance of uninterrupted subterranean noise, unaccompanied by\r\nany trace of an earthquake, is the phenomenon known in the Mexican elevated\r\nplateaux by the name of the \"roaring and the subterranean thunder)\r\n('bramidos y truenos subterraneos') of Guanaxuato.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the 'bramidos' of Guanaxuato, see my 'Essai Polit. sur la\r\nNouv. Espagne', t. i., p. 303.  The subterranean noise, unaccompanied with\r\nany appreciable shock, in the deep mines and on the surface (the town of\r\nGuanaxuata lies 6830 feet above the level of the sea), was not heard in the\r\nneighboring elevated plains, but only in the mountainous parts of the\r\nSierra, from the Cuesta de los Aguilares, near Marfil, to the north of Santa\r\nRosa.  There were individual parts of the Sierra 24-28 miles northwest of\r\nGuanaxuata, to the other side of Chichimequillo, near the boiling spring of\r\nSan Jose de Comgngillas, to which the waves of sound did not extend.\r\nExtremely stringent measures were adopted by the magistrates of the large\r\nmountain towns on the 14th of January 1784, when the terror produced by\r\nthese subterranean thunders was at its height.  \"The flight of a wealthy\r\nfamily shall be punished with a fine of 1000 piasters, and that of a poor\r\nfamily with two months' imprisonment.  The militia shall bring back the\r\nfugitives.\"  One of the most remarkable points about the whole affair is the\r\nopinion which the magistrates (el cabildo) cherished of their own superior\r\nknowledge.  In one of their 'proclamas', I find the expression, \"The\r\nmagistrates, in their wisdom (en su sabiduria), will at once know when there\r\nis actual danger, and will give orders for flight; for the present, let\r\nprocessions be instituted.\"  The terror excited by the tremor gave rise to a\r\nfamine, since it prevented the importation of corn from the table-lands,\r\nwhere it abounded.  The ancients were also aware that noises sometimes\r\nexisted without earthquakes. -- Aristot., 'Meteor.', ii., p. 802; Plin.,\r\nii., 80.  The singular noise that was heard from March, 1822, to September,\r\n1824, in the Dalmatian island Meleda (sixteen miles from Ragusa) and on\r\nwhich Partsch has thrown much light, was occasionally accompanied by shocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis celebrated and rich mountain city lies far removed from any active\r\nvolcano.  The noise began about midnight on the 9th of January, 1784, and\r\ncontinued for a month.  I have been enabled to give a circumstantial\r\np 210\r\ndescription of it from the report of many witnesses, and from the documents\r\nof the municipality, of which I was allowed to make use.  From the 13th to\r\nthe 16th of January, it seemed to the inhabitants as if heavy clouds lay\r\nbeneath their feet, from which issued alternate slow rolliing sounds and\r\nshort, quick claps of thunder.  The noise abated as gradually as it had\r\nbegun.  It was limited to a small space, and was not heard in a basaltic\r\ndistrict at the distance of a few miles.  Almost all the inhabitants, in\r\nterror, left the city, in which large masses of silver ingots were stored;\r\nbut the most courageous, and those more accustomed to subterranean thunder,\r\nsoon returned, in order to drive off the bands of robbers who had attempted\r\nto possess themselves of the treasures of the city.  Neither on the surface\r\nof the earth, nor in mines 1600 feet in depth, was the slightest shock to be\r\nperceived.  No similar noise had ever before been heard on the elevated\r\ntableland of Mexico, nor has this terrific phenomenon since occurred there.\r\nThus clefts are opened or closed in the interior of the earth, by which\r\nwaves of sound penetrate to us or are impeded in their propagation.\r\n\r\nThe activity of an igneous mountain, however terrific and picturesque the\r\nspectacle may be which it presents to our contemplation, is always limited\r\nto a very small space.  It is far otherwise with earthquakes, which although\r\nscarcely perceptible to the eye, nevertheless simultaneously propagate their\r\nwaves to a distance of many thousand miles.  The great earthquake which\r\ndestroyed the city of Lisbon on the 1st of November, 1755, and whose effects\r\nwere so admirably investigated by the distinguished philosopher Emmanuel\r\nKant, was felt in the Alps, on the coast of Sweden, in the Antilles,\r\nAntigua, Barbadoes, and Martinique; in the great Canadian Lakes, in\r\nThuringia, in the flat country of Northern Germany, and in the small inland\r\nlakes on the shores of the Baltic.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[It has been computed that the shock of this earthquake\r\npervaded an area of 700,000 miles, or the twelfth part of the circumference\r\nof the globe.  This dreadful shock lasted only five minutes:  it happened\r\nabout nine o'clock in the morning of the Feast of all Saints, whien almost\r\nthe whole population was within the churches, owing to which circumstance no\r\nless than 30,000 persons perished by the fall of these edifices.  See\r\nDaubeney 'On Volcanoes', p. 514-517.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemote springs were interrupted in their flow, a phenomenon attending\r\nearthquakes which had been noticed among the ancients by Demetrius the\r\nCallatian.  The hot springs of Toplitz dried up, and returned, inundating\r\nevery thing around, and having their waters colored with iron ocher.  In\r\nCadiz\r\np 211\r\nthe sea rose to an elevation of sixty-four feet, while in the Antilles,\r\nwhere the tide usually rises only from twenty-six to twenty-eight inches, it\r\nsuddenly rose above twenty feet, the water being of an inky blackness.  It\r\nhas been computed that on the 1st of November, 1755, a portion of the\r\nEarth's surface four times greater than that of Europe, was simultaneously\r\nshaken.  As yet there is no manifestation of force known to us, including\r\neven the murderous inventions of our own race, by which a greater number of\r\npeople have been killed in the short space of a few minutes:  sixty thousand\r\nwere destroyed in Sicily in 1693, from thirty to forty thousand in the\r\nearthquake of Riobamba in 1797, and probably five times as many in Asia\r\nMinor and Syria, under Tiberius and Justinian the elder, about the years 19\r\nand 526.\r\n\r\nThere are instances in which the earth has been shaken for many successive\r\ndays in the chain of the Andes in South America, but I am only acquainted\r\nwith the following cases in which shocks that have been felt almost every\r\nhour for months together have occurred far from any volcano, as, for\r\ninstance, on the eastern declivity of the Alpine chain of Mount Cenis, at\r\nFenestrelles and Pignerol, from April, 1808; between New Madrid and Little\r\nPrairie,* north of Cincinnati in the United States of America, in December,\r\n1811, as well as through the whole winter of 1812; and in the Pachalik of\r\nAleppo, in the months of August and September, 1822.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Drake, 'Nat. and Statist. View of Cincinnati', p. 232-238;\r\nMitchell, in the 'Transactions of the Lit. and Philos. Soc. of New York',\r\nvol. i., p. 281-308.  In the Piedmonese county of Pignerol, glasses of\r\nwater, filled to the very brim, exhibited for hours a continuous motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the mass of the people are seldom able to rise to general views, and are\r\nconsequently always disposed to ascribe great phenomena to local telluric\r\nand atmospheric processes, wherever the shaking of the earth is continued\r\nfor a long time, fears of  the eruption of a new volcano are awakened.  In\r\nsome few cases, this apprehension has certainly proved to be well grounded,\r\nas, for instance, in the sudden elevation of volcanic islands, and as we see\r\nin the elevation of the volcano of Jorullo, a mountain elevated 1684 feet\r\nabove the ancient level of the neighboring plain, on the 29th of September\r\n1759, after ninety days of earthquake and subterranean thunder.\r\n\r\nIf we could obtain information regarding the daily condition of all the\r\nearth's surface, we should probably discover that the earth is almost always\r\nundergoing shocks at some point of its superficies, and is continually\r\ninfluenced by the reaction\r\np 212\r\nof the interior on the exterior.  The frequency and general prevalence of a\r\nphenomenon which is probably dependent on the raised temperature of the\r\ndeepest molten strata explain its independence of the nature of the mineral\r\nmasses in which it manifests itself.  Earthquakes have even been felt in the\r\nloose alluvial strata of Holland, as in the neighborhood of Middleburg and\r\nvliessingen on the 23d of February, 1828.  Granite and mica slate are shaken\r\nas well as limestone and sandstone, or as trachyte and amygdaloid.  It is\r\nnot, therefore, the chemical nature of the constituents, but rather the\r\nmechanical structure of the rocks, which modifies the propagation of the\r\nmotion, the wave of commotion.  Where this wave proceeds along a coast, or\r\nat the foot and in the direction of a mountain chain, interruptions at\r\ncertain points have sometimes been remarked, which manifested themselves\r\nduring the course of many centuries.  The undulation advances in the depths\r\nbelow, but is never felt at the same points on the surface.  The Peruvians*\r\nsay of these unmoved upper strata that \"they form a bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *In Spanish they say, 'rocas que hacen puente'.  With this\r\nphenomenon of non-propagation through superior strata is connected the\r\nremarkable fact that in the beginning of this century shocks were felt in\r\nthe deep silver mines at Marienberg, in the Saxony mining district, while\r\nnot the slightest trace was perceptible at the surface.  The miners ascended\r\nin a state of alarm.  Conversely, the workmen in the mines of Falun and\r\nPersberg felt nothing of the shocks which in November, 1823, spread dismay\r\namong the inhabitants above ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the mountain chains appear to be raised on fissures, the walls of the\r\ncavities may perhaps favor the direction of undulations parallel to them;\r\noccasionally, however, the waves of commotion intersect several chains\r\nalmost perpenducularly.  Thus we see them simultaneously breaking through\r\nthe littoral chain of Venezuela and the Sierra Parime.  In Asia, shocks of\r\nearthquakes have been propagated from Lahore and from the foot of the\r\nHimalaya (22d of January, 1832) transversely across the chain of the Hindoo\r\nChou to Badakschan, the upper Oxus, and even to Bokhara.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Sir Alex. Burnes, 'Travels in Bokhara', vol. i., p. 18; and\r\nWathen, 'Mem. on the Usbek State', in the 'Journal of the Asiatic Society of\r\nBengal', vol. iii., p. 337.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circles of commotion unfortunately expand occasionally in consequence of\r\na single and usually violent earthquake.  It is only since the destruction\r\nof Cumana, on the 14th of December, 1797, that shocks on the southern coast\r\nhave been felt in the mica slate rocks of the peninsula of Maniquarez,\r\nsituated opposite to the chalk hills of the main land.  The advance\r\np 213\r\nfrom south to north was very striking in the almost uninterrupted\r\nundulations of the soil in the alluvial valleys of the Mississippi, the\r\nArkansas, and the Ohio, from 1811 to 1813.  It seemed here as if\r\nsubterranean obstacles were gradually overcome, and that the way being once\r\nopened, the undulatory movement could be freely propagated.\r\n\r\nAlthough earthquakes appear at first sight to be simply dynamic phenomena of\r\nmotion, we yet discover, from well-attested facts, that they are not only\r\nable to elevate a whole district above its ancient level (as for instance,\r\nthe Ulla Bund, Delta of the Indus, or the coast of Chili, in November,\r\n1822), but we also find that various substances have been ejected during the\r\nearthquake, as hot water at Catania in 1818; hot steam at New Madrid, in the\r\nValley of the Mississippi, in 1812; irrespirable gases, 'Mofettes', which\r\ninjured the flocks grazing in the chain of the Andes; mud, black smoke, and\r\neven flames, at Messina in 1781, and at Cumana on the 14th of November,\r\n1797.  During the great earthquake of Lisbon, on the 1st of November, 1755,\r\nflames and columns of smoke were seen to rise from a newly-formed fissure in\r\nthe rock of Alvidras, near the city.  The smoke in this case became more\r\ndense as the subterranean noise increased in intensity.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * 'Philos. Transaci.', vol. xlix. p. 414.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the destruction of Riobamba, in the year 1797, when the shocks were not\r\nattended by any outbreak of the neighboring volcano, a singular mass called\r\nthe 'Moya' was uplifted from the earth in numerous continuous conical\r\nelevations, the whole being composed of carbon, crystals of augite, and the\r\nsilicious shields of infusoria.  The eruption of carbonic acid gas from\r\nfissures in the Valley of the Magdalene, during the earthquake of New\r\nGranada, on the 16th of November, 1827, suffocated many snakes, rats, and\r\nother animals.  Sudden changes of weather, as the occurrence of the rainy\r\nseason in the tropics, at an unusual period of the year, have sometimes\r\nsucceeded violent earthquakes in Quito and Peru.  Do gaseous fluids rise\r\nfrom the interior of the earth, and mix with the atmosphere? or are these\r\nmeteorological processes the action of atmospheric electricity disturbed by\r\nthe earthquake?  In the tropical regions of America, where sometimes not a\r\ndrop of rain falls for ten months together, the natives consider the\r\nrepeated shocks of earthquakes, which do not endanger the low reed huts, as\r\nauspicious harbingers of fruitfulness and abundant rain.\r\n\r\np 214\r\nThe intimate connection of the phenomena which we have considered is still\r\nhidden in obscurity.  Elastic fluids are doublessly the cause of the slight\r\nand perfectly harmless trembling of the earth's surface, which has often\r\ncontinued several days (as in 1816, at Scaccia, in Sicily, before the\r\nvolcanic elevation of the island of Julia), as well as of the terrific\r\nexplosions accompanied by loud noise.  The focus of this destructive agent,\r\nthe seat of the moving force, lies far below the earth's surface; but we\r\nknow as little of the extent of this depth as we know of the chemical nature\r\nof these vapors that are so highly compressed.  At the edges of two craters,\r\nVesuvius, and the towering rock which projects beyond the great abyss of\r\nPichincha, near Quito, I have felt periodic and very regular shocks of\r\nearthquakes, on each occasion from 20 to 30 seconds before the burning\r\nscoriae or gases were erupted.  The intensity of the shocks was increased in\r\nproportion to the time intervening between them, and, consequently, to the\r\nlength of time in which the vapors were accumulating.  This simple fact,\r\nwhich has been attested by the evidence of so many travelers, furnishes us\r\nwith a general solution of the phenomenon, in showing that active volcanoes\r\nare to be considered as safety-valves for the immediate neighborhood.  The\r\ndanger of earthquakes increases when the openings of the volcano are closed,\r\nand deprived of free communication with the atmosphere; but the destruction\r\nof Lisbon, of Caraccas, of Lima, of Cashmir in 1554,* and of so many cities\r\nof Calabria, Syria, and Asia Minor, shows us, on the whole, that the force\r\nof the shock is not the greatest in the neighborhood of active volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the frequency of earthquakes in Cashmir, see Troyer's German\r\ntranslation of the ancient 'Radjataringini', vol. ii., p. 297, and Carl\r\nHugel, 'Reisen', bd. ii., s. 184.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the impeded activity of the volcano acts upon the shocks of the earth's\r\nsurface, so do the latter react on the volcanic phenomena.  Openings of\r\nfissures favor the rising of cones of eruption, and the processes which take\r\nplace in these cones, by forming a free communication with the atmosphere.\r\nA column of smoke, which had been observed to rise for months together from\r\nthe volcano of Pasto, in South America, suddenly disappeared, when on the\r\n4th of February, 1797, the province of Quito, situated at a distance of 192\r\nmiles to the south, suffered from the great earthquake of Riobamba.  After\r\nthe earth had continued to tremble for some time through out the whole of\r\nSyria, in the Cyclades, and in Euboea, the shocks suddenly ceased on the\r\neruption of a stream of hot mud\r\np 215\r\non the Lelantine plains near Chalcia.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Strabo, lib. i., p. 100, Casaub.  That the expression [Greek\r\nwords] does not mean erupted mud, but lava, is obvious from a passage in\r\nStrabo, lib. vi., p. 412.  Compare Walter, in his 'Abnahme der Vulkanischen\r\nThatigkeit in Historischen Zeiten' (On the Decrease of Volcanic Activity\r\nduring Historical Times), 1844, s. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intelligent geographer of Amasea, to whom we are indebted for the notice\r\nof this circumstance, further remarks:  \"Since the craters of Aetna have\r\nbeen opened, which yield a passage to the escape of fire, and since burning\r\nmasses and water have been ejected, the country near the sea-shore has not\r\nbeen so much shaken as at the time previous to the separation of Sicily from\r\nLower Italy, when all communications with the external surface were closed.\"\r\n\r\nWe thus recognize in earthquakes the existence of a volcanic force, which,\r\nalthough every where manifested, and as generally diffused as the internal\r\nheat of our planet, attains but rarely, and then only at separate points,\r\nsufficient intensity to exhibit the phenomenon of eruptions.  The formation\r\nof veins, that is to say, the filling up of fissures with crystalline masses\r\nbursting forth from the interior (as basalt, melaphyre, and greenstone),\r\ngradually disturbs the free intercommunication of elastic vapors.  This\r\ntension acts in three different ways, either in causing disruptions, or\r\nsudden and retroversed elevations, or, finally, as was first observed in a\r\ngreat part of Sweden, in producing changes in the relative level of the sea\r\nand land, which, although continuous, are only appreciable at intervals of\r\nlong period.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the important phenomena which we have considered not so much\r\nin their individual characteristics as in their general physical and\r\ngeognostical relations, I would advert to the deep and peculiar impression\r\nleft on the mind by the first earthquake which we experience, eeven where it\r\nis not attended by any subterranean noise.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[Dr. Tschudi, in his interesting work, 'Travels in Peru',\r\ntranslated from the German by Thomasina Ross, p. 170, 1847, describes\r\nstrikingly the effect of an earthquake upon the native and upon the\r\nstranger.  \"No familiarity with the phenomenon can blunt this feeling.  The\r\ninhabitant of Lima, who from childhood has frequently witnessed these\r\nconvulsions of nature, is roused from his sleep by the shock, and rushes\r\nfrom his apartment with the cry of 'Misericordia!'  The foreigner from the\r\nnorth of Europe, who knows nothing of earthquakes but by description, waits\r\nwith impatience to feel the movement of the earth, and longs to hear with\r\nhis own ear the subterranean sounds which he has hitherto considered\r\nfabulous.  With levity he treats the apprehension of a coming convulsion,\r\nand laughs at the fears of the natives:  but, as soon as his wish is\r\ngratified, he is terror-stricken, and is involuntarily prompted to seek\r\nsafety in flight.\"] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis impression is not,\r\np 216\r\nin my opinion, the result of a recollection of those fearful pictures of\r\ndevastation presented to our imaginations by the historical narratives of\r\nthe past, but is rather due to the sudden revelation of the delusive nature\r\nof the inherent faith by which we had clung to a belief in the immobility of\r\nthe solid parts of the earth.  We are accustomed from early childhood to\r\ndraw a contrast between the mobility of water and the immobility of the soil\r\non which we tread; and this feeling is confirmed by the evidence of our\r\nsenses.  When, therefore, we suddenly feel the ground move beneath us, a\r\nmysterious and natural force, with which we are previously unacquainted, is\r\nrevealed to us as an active disturbance of stability.  A moment destroys the\r\nillusion of a whole life; our deceptive faith in the repose of nature\r\nvanishes, and we feel transported, as it were, into a realm of unknown\r\ndestructive forces.  Every sound -- the faintest motion in the air --\r\narrests our attention, and we no longer trust the ground on which we stand.\r\nAnimals, especially dogs and swine, participate in the same anxious\r\ndisquietude; and even the crocodiles of the Orinoco, which are at other\r\ntimes as dumb as our little lizards, leave the trembling bed of the river,\r\nand run with loud cries into the adjacent forests.\r\n\r\nTo man the earthquake conveys an idea of some universal and unlimited\r\ndanger.  We may flee from the crater of a volcano in active eruption, or\r\nfrom the dwelling whose destruction is threatened by the approach of the\r\nlava stream; but in an earthquake, direct our flight whithersoever we will,\r\nwe still feel as if we trod upon the very focus of destruction.  This\r\ncondition of the mind is not of long duration, although it takes its origin\r\nin the deepest recesses of our nature; and when a series of faint shocks\r\nsucceed one another, the inhabitants of the country soon lose every trace of\r\nfear.  On the coasts of Peru, where rain and hail are unknown, no less than\r\nthe rolling thunder and the flashing lightning, these luminous explosions of\r\nthe atmosphere are replaced by the subterranean noises which accompany\r\nearthquakes.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[\"Along the whole coast of Peru the atmosphere is almost\r\nuniformly in a state of repose.  It is not illuminated by the lightning's\r\nflash, or disturbed by the roar of the thunder; no deluges of rain, no\r\nfierce hurricanes, destroy the fruits of the fields, and with them the hopes\r\nof the husbandman.  But the mildness of the elements above ground is\r\nfrightfully counterbalanced by their subterranean fury.  Lima is frequently\r\nvisited by earthquakes, and several times the city has been reduced to a\r\nmass of ruins.  At an average, forty-five shocks may be counted on in the\r\nyear.  Most of them occur in the later part of October, in November,\r\nDecember, January, May, and June.  Experience gives reason to expect the\r\nvisitation of two desolating earthquakes in a century.  The period between\r\nthe two is from forty to sixty years.  The most considerable catastrophes\r\nexperienced in Lima since Europeans have visited the west coast of South\r\nAmerica happened in the years 1586, 1630, 1687, 1713, 1746, 1806.  There is\r\nreason to fear that in the course of a few years this city may be the prey\r\nof another such visitation.\"] --Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong habit, and the very\r\np 217\r\nprevalent opinion that dangerous shocks are only to be apprehended two or\r\nthree times in the course of a century, cause faint oscillations of the soil\r\nto be regarded in Lima with scarcely more attention than a hail storm in the\r\ntemperate zone.\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken a general view of the activity -- the inner life, as it\r\nwere -- of the Earth, in respect to its internal heat, its electro-magnetic\r\ntension, its emanation of light at the poles, and its irregularly-recurring\r\nphenomena of motion, we will now proceed to the consideration of the\r\nmaterial products, the chemical changes in the earth's surface, and the\r\ncomposition of the atmosphere, which are all dependent on planetary vital\r\nactivity.

The occurrence of abundant\r\nexhalations of sulphuric acid, which have been hitherto noticed chiefly in\r\nextinct volcanoes, as for instance, in a stream issuing from that of Purace,\r\nbetween Bogota and Quito, from extinct volcanoes in Java, is satisfactorily\r\nexplained in a recent paper by M. Dumas, 'Annales de Chimie', Dec., 1846.\r\nHe shows that when sulphureted hydrogen, at a temperature above 100 degrees\r\nFahr., and still better when near 190 degrees, comes in contact with certain\r\nporous bodies, a catalytic action is set up, by which water, sulphuric acid,\r\nand sulphur are produced.  Hence probably the vast deposits of sulphur,\r\nassociated with sulphates of lime and strontian, which are met with in the\r\nwestern parts of Sicily.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch effusions\r\np 218\r\nfrom the fissures of the earth not only occur in the districts of still\r\nburning or long-extinguished volcanoes, but they may likewise be observed\r\noccasionally in districts where neither trachyte nor any other volcanic\r\nrocks are exposed on the earth's surface.  In the chain of Quindiu I have\r\nseen sulphur deposited in mica slate from warm sulphurous vapor at an\r\nelevation of 6832 feet* above the level of the sea, while the same species\r\nof rock, which was formerly regarded as primitive, contains, in the Cerro\r\nCuello, near Tiscan, south of Quito, an immense deposit of sulphur imbedded\r\nin pure quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Humboldt, 'Recucil d'Observ. Astronomiques', t. i., p. 311\r\n('Nivellement Barometrique de la Cordillere des Andes', No. 206).\r\n\r\n\r\nExhalations of carbonic acid ('mofettes') are even in our days to be\r\nconsidered as the most important of all gaseous emanations, with respect to\r\ntheir number and the amount of their effusion.  We see in Germany, in the\r\ndeep valleys of the Eifel, in the neighborhood of the Lake of Laach,* in the\r\ncrater-like valley of the Wehr and in Western Bohemia, exhalations of\r\ncarbonic acid gas manifest themselves as the last efforts of volcanic\r\nactivity in or near the foci of an earlier world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[The Lake of Laach, in the district of the Eifel, is an expanse\r\nof water two miles in circumference.  The thickness of the vegetation on the\r\nsides of its crater-like basin renders it difficult to discover the nature\r\nof the subjacent rock, but it is probably composed of black cellular augitic\r\nlava.  The sides of the crater present numerous loose masses, which appear\r\nto have been ejected, and consist of glassy feldspar, ice-spar, sodalite,\r\nhauyne, spinellane, and leucite.  The resemblance between these products and\r\nthe masses formerly ejected from Vesuvius is most remarkable.  (Daubeney 'On\r\nVolcanoes', p. 81.)  Dr. Hibbert regards the Lake of Laach as formed in the\r\nfirst instance by a crack caused by the cooling of the crust of the earth,\r\nwhich was widened afterward into a circular cavity by the expansive force of\r\nelastic vapors.  See 'History of the Extinct Volcanoes of the Basin of\r\nNeuwied', 1832.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those earlier periods, when a higher terrestrial temperature existed, and\r\nwhen a great number of fissures still remained unfilled, the processes we\r\nhave described acted more powerfully, and carbonic acid and hot steam were\r\nmixed in larger quantities in the atmosphere, from whence it follows, as\r\nAdolph Bronguiart has ingeniously shown,* that the primitive vegetable world\r\nmust have exhibited almost every where, and independently of geographical\r\nposition, the most luxurious abundance and the fullest development of\r\norganism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Adolph Bronguiart, in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles', t.\r\nxv., p. 225.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these constantly warm and damp atmospheric strata, saturated with\r\np 219\r\ncarbonic acid, vegetation must have attained a degree of vital activity, and\r\nderived the superabundance of nutrition necessary to furnish materials for\r\nthe formation of the beds of lignite (coal) constituting the inexhaustible\r\nmeans on which are based the physical power and prosperity of nations.  Such\r\nmasses are distributed in basins over certain parts of Europe, occurring in\r\nlarge quantities in the British Islands, in Belgium, in France, in the\r\nprovinces of the Lower Rhine, and in Upper Silesia.  At the same primitive\r\nperiod of universal volcanic activity, those enormous quantities of carbon\r\nmust also have escaped from the earth which are contained in limestone\r\nrocks, and which, if seprated from oxygen and reduced to a solid form, would\r\nconstitute about the eighth part of the absolute bulk of these mountain\r\nmasses.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Bischof, op. cit., s. 324, Anm. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat portion of the carbon which was not taken up by alkaline earths, but\r\nremained mixed with the atmosphere, as carbonic acid, was gradually consumed\r\nby the vegetation of the earlier stages of processes of vegetable life, only\r\nretained the small quantity which it now possesses, and which is not\r\ninjurious to the sulphurous vapor have occasioned the destruction of the\r\nspecies of mollusca and fish which inhabited the inland waters of the\r\nearlier world, and have given rise to the formation of the contorted beds of\r\ngypsum, which have doubtless been frequently affected by shocks of\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\nGaseous and liquid fluids, mud, and molten earths, ejected from the craters\r\nof volcanoes, which are themselves only a kind of \"intermittent springs,\"\r\nrise from the earth under precisely analogous physical relations.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 43.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these substances owe their temperature and their chemical character to\r\nthe place of their origin.  The 'mean' temperature of aqueous springs is\r\nless than that of the air at the point whence they emerge, if the water flow\r\nfrom a height; but their heat increases with the depth of the strata with\r\nwhich they are in contact at their origin.  We have already spoken of the\r\nnumerical law regulating this increase.  The blending of waters that have\r\ncome from the height of a mountain with those that have sprung from the\r\ndepths of the earth, render it difficult to determine the position of the\r\n'isogeothermal lines'* (lines of equal internal\r\np 220\r\nterrestrial temperature, when this determination is to be made from the\r\ntemperature of flowing springs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the theory of isogeothermal (chthonisothermal) lines,\r\nconsult the ingenious labors of Kupffer, in Pogg, 'Annalen', bd xv., s. 184,\r\nand bd xxxii., s. 270, in the 'Voyage dans l'Oural', p. 382-298, and in the\r\n'Edinburgh Journal of Science', New Series, vol. iv., p. 355.

The temperature of\r\nsprings, which has become the subject of such continuous physical\r\ninvestigation during the last half century, depends, like the elevation of\r\nthe line of perpetual snow, on very many simultaneous and deeply-involved\r\ncauses.  It is a function of the temperature of the stratum in which they\r\ntake their rise, of the specific heat of the soil, and of the quantity and\r\ntemperature of the meteoric water,* which is itself different from the\r\ntemperature of the lower strata of the atmosphere, according to the\r\ndifferent modes of its origin in rain, snow, or hail.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. v. Buch, in Pogg., 'Annalen', bd. xii., s. 405.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** On the temperature of the drops, of rain in Cumana, which\r\nfell to 72 degrees, when the temperature of the air shortly before had been\r\n86 degrees and 88 degrees, and during the rain sank to 74 degrees, see my\r\n'Relat. Hist.', t. ii., p. 22.  The rain-drops, while falling, change the\r\nnormal temperature they originally possessed, which depends on the height of\r\nthe clouds from which they fell, and their heating on their upper surface by\r\nthe solar rays.  The rain-drops, on their first production, have a higher\r\ntemperature than the surrounding medium in the superior strata of our\r\natmosphere, in consequence of the liberation of their latent heat; and they\r\ncontinue to rise in temperature, since, in falling through lower and warmer\r\nstrata, vapor is precipitated on them, and they thus increase in size\r\n(Bischof, 'Warmelehre des inneren Erdkorpers' s. 73); but this additional\r\nheating is compensated for by evaporation.  The cooling of the air by rain\r\n(putting out of the question what probably belongs to the electric process\r\nin storms) is effected by the drops, which are themselves of lower\r\ntemperature, in consequence of the cold situation in which they were formed,\r\nand bring down with them a portion of the higher colder air, and which\r\nfinally, by moistening the ground, give rise to evaporation.  The cooling of\r\nthe air by rain (putting out of the question what probably belongs to the\r\nelectric process in storms) is effected by the drops, which are themselves\r\nof lower temperature, in consequence of the cold situation in which they\r\nwere formed, and bringi down with them a portion of the higher colder air,\r\nand which finally, by moistening the ground, give rise to evaporation.\r\nThese are the ordinary relations of the phenomenon.  When, as occasionally\r\nhappens, the rain-drops are warmer than the lower strata of the atmosphere\r\n(Humboldt, 'Rel. Hist.', t. iii., p. 513), the cause must probably be sought\r\nin higher warmer currents, or in a higher temperature of widely-extended and\r\nnot very thick clouds, from the action of the sun's rays.  How, moreover,\r\nthe phenomenon of supplementary rainbows, which are explained by the\r\ninterference of light, is connected with the original and increasing size of\r\nthe falling drops, and how an optical phenomenon, if we know how to observe\r\nit accurately, may enlighten us regarding a meteorological process,\r\naccording to diversity of zone, has been shown, with much talent and\r\ningenuity, by Arago, in the 'Annuaire' for 1836, p. 300.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold springs can only indicate the mean atmospheric temperature\r\np 221\r\nwhen they are unmixed with the waters rising from great depths, or\r\ndescending from considerable mountain elevations, and when they have passed\r\nthrough a long course at a depth from the surface of the earth which is\r\nequal in our latitudes to 40 or 60 feet, and according to Boussingault, to\r\nabout one foot in the equinoctial regions,* these being the depths at which\r\nthe invariability of the temperature begins in the temperate and torrid\r\nzones, that is to say, the depths at which horary, diurnal, and monthly\r\nchanges of heat in the atmosphere cease to be perceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * The profound investigations of Boussingault fully convince me,\r\nthat in the tropics, the temperature of the ground, at a very slight depth,\r\nexactly corresponds with the mean temperature of the air.

Hist.', t. iii., p. 191-196), are\r\nresolved by the consideration that I compared the presumed mean temperature\r\nof the air of the convent of Caripe, 65.3 degrees, not with the temperature\r\nof the air of the cave, 65.6 degrees, but with the temperature of the\r\nsubterranean stream, 62.3degrees, although I observed ('Rel. Hist.', t.\r\niii., p. 146 and 195) that mountain water from a great height might probably\r\nbe mixed with the water of the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nHot springs issue from the most various kinds of rocks.  The hottest\r\npermanent springs that have hitherto been observed are, as my own researches\r\nconfirm, at a distance from all volcanoes.  I will here advert to a notice\r\nin my journal of the Aguas Calientes de las Trincheras', in South America,\r\nbetween Porto Cabello and Nueva Valencia, and the 'Aguas de Comangillas', in\r\nthe Mexican territory, near Guanaxuato; the former of these, which issued\r\nfrom granite, had a temperature of 194.5 degrees; the latter, issuing from\r\nbasalt, 205.5degrees.  The depth of the source from whence the water flowed\r\nwith this temperature, judging from what we know of the law of the increase\r\nof heat in the interior of the earth, was probably 7140 feet, or above two\r\nmiles.  If the universally-diffused terrestrial heat be the cause of thermal\r\nsprings, as of active volcanoes, the rocks can only exert an influence by\r\nthe different capacities\r\np 222\r\nfor heat and by their conducting powers.  The hottest of all permanent\r\nsprings (between 203 degrees and 209 degrees) are likewise, in a most\r\nremarkable degree, the purest, and such as hold in solution the smallest\r\nquantity of mineral substances.  Their temperature appears, on the whole, to\r\nbe less constant than that of springs between 122 degrees and 165 degrees,\r\nwhich in Europe, at least, have maintained, in a most remarkable manner,\r\ntheir 'invariability of heat and mineral contents' during the last fifty or\r\nsixty years, a period in which thermometrical measurements and chemical\r\nanalyses have been applied with increasing exactness.  Boussingault found in\r\n1823 that the thermal springs of Las Tricheras had risen 12 degrees during\r\nthe twenty-three years that had intervened since my travels in 1800.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Boussingault, in the 'Annales de chimie', t. lii., p. 181.  The\r\nspring of Chaudes Aigues, in Auvergne, is only 176degrees.  It is also to be\r\nobserved, that while the Aguas Calientes de las Trincheras, south of Porto\r\nCabello (Venezuela), springing from granite cleft in regular beds, and far\r\nfrom all volcanoes, have a temperature of fully 206.6 degrees, all the\r\nsprings which rise in the vicinity of still active volcanoes (Pasto,\r\nCotopaxi, and Tunguragua) have a temperature of only 97 - 130 degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis calmly-flowing spring is therefore now nearly 12 degrees hotter than\r\nthe intermittent fountains of the Geyser and the Strokr, whose temperature\r\nhas recently been most carefully determined by Krug of Nidda.  A very\r\nstriking proof of the origin of hot springs by the sinking of cold meteoric\r\nwater into the earth, and by its contact with a volcanic focus, is afforded\r\nby the volcano of Jorulla in Mexico, which was unknown before my American\r\njourney.  When, in September, 1759, Jorullo was suddenly elevated into a\r\nmountain 1183 feet above the level of the surrounding plain, two small\r\nrivers, the 'Rio de Cuitimba' and 'Rio de San Pedro', disappeared, and some\r\ntime afterward burst forth again, during violent shocks of an earthquake, as\r\nhot springs, whose temperature I found in 1803 to be 186.4 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe springs in Greece still evidently flow at the same places as in the\r\ntimes of Hellenic antiquity.  The spring of Erasinos, two hours' journey to\r\nthe south of Argos, on the declivity of Chaon, is mentioned by Herodotus.\r\nAt Delphi we still see Cassotis (now the springs of St. Nicholas) rising\r\nsouth of the Lesche, and flowing beneath the Temple of Apollo; Castalia, at\r\nthe foot of Phaedriadae; Pirene, near Acro-Corinth; and the hot baths of\r\nAedipsus, in Euboea, in which Sulla bathed during the Mithridatic war.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Cassotis (the spring of St. Nicholas) and Castalia, at the\r\nPhaedriadae, mentioned in Pausanias, x., 24, 25, and x., 8, 9; Pirene\r\n(Acro-Corinth), in Strabo, p. 379; the spring of Erasinos, at Mount Chaon,\r\nsouth of Argos, in Herod., vi., 67, and Pausanias, ii., 24, 7; the springs\r\nof Aedipsus in Euboea, some of which have a temperature of 88 degrees, while\r\nin others it ranges between 144) qne 167 degrees, in Strabo, p. 60 and 447,\r\nand Athenaeus, ii., 3, 73; the hot springs of Thermopylae, at the foot of\r\nOeta, with a temperature of 149 degrees.  All from manuscript notes by\r\nProfessor Curtius, the learned companion of Otfried Muller.\r\n\r\n\r\nI advert with pleasure to these\r\np 223\r\nfacts, as they show us that, even in a country subject to frequent and\r\nviolent shocks of earthquakes, the interior of our planet has retained for\r\nupward of 2000 years its ancient configuration in reference to the course of\r\nthe open fissures that yield a passage to these waters.  The 'Fontaine\r\njaillissante' of Lillers, in the Department des Pas de Calais, which was\r\nbored as early as the year 1126, still rises to the same height and yields\r\nthe same quantity of water; and, as another instance, I may mention that the\r\nadmirable geographer of the Caramanian coast, Captain Beaufort, saw in the\r\ndistrict of Phaselis the same flame fed by emissions of inflammable gas\r\nwhich was described by Pliny as the flame of the Lycian Chimera.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnnote]  (Pliny, ii., 106; Seneca, 'Epist.' 79, 3, ed.

The soot\r\ndeposited from the flames was regarded as efficacious for sore eyelids, and\r\nvalued as a dye for the eyebrows.\"  See the highly interesting and accurate\r\nwork, 'Travels in Lycia', by Lieut. Spratt and Professor E. Forbes.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observation made by Arago in 1821, that the deepest Artesian wells are\r\nthe warmest,* threw great light on the origin of thermal springs, and on the\r\nestablishment of the law that terrestrial heat increases with increasing\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire pour' 1835, p. 234.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, which has but recently been noticed, that at the\r\nclose of the third century, St. Patricus,* probably Bishop of Pertusa, was\r\nled to adopt very correct views regarding the phenomenon of the hot springs\r\nat Carthage.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'Acta S. Patricii', p. 555, ed. Ruinart, t. ii., p. 385,\r\nMazochi.  Dureau de la Malle was the first to draw attention to this\r\nremarkable passage in the 'Recherches sur la Topographie de Carthage', 1835,\r\np. 276.  (See, also, Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest.', iii., 24.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn being asked what was the cause of boiling water bursting from the earth,\r\nhe replied, \"Fire is nourished in the clouds and in the interior\r\np 224\r\nof the earth, as Aetna and other mountains near Naples may teach you.  The\r\nsubterranean waters rise as if through siphons.  The cause of hot springs is\r\nthis:  waters which are more remote from the subterranean fire are colder,\r\nwhile those which rise nearer the fire are heated by it, and bring with them\r\nto the surface which we inhabit an insupportable degree of heat.\"\r\n\r\nAs earthquakes are often accompanied by eruptions of water and vapors, we\r\nrecognize in the 'Salses',* of small mud volcanoes, a transition from the\r\nchanging phenomena presented by these eruptions of vapor and thermal springs\r\nto the more powerful and awful activity of the streams of lava that flow\r\nfrom volcanic mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[True volcanoes, as we have seen, generate sulphureted hydrogen\r\nand muriatic acid, upheave tracts of land, and omit streams of melted\r\nfeldspathic materials; salses, on the contrary, disengage little else but\r\ncarbureted hydrogen, together with bitumen and other products of the\r\ndistillation of coal, and pour forth no other torrents except of mud, or\r\nargillaceous materials mixed up with water.  Daubeney, op cit., p. 540.] --\r\nTr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we consider these mountains as springs of molten earths producing\r\nvolcanic rocks, we must remember that thermal water, when impregnated with\r\ncarbonic acid and sulphurous gases, are continually forming horizontally\r\nranged strata of limestone (travertine) or conical elevations, as in\r\nNorthern Africa (in Alberia), and in the Banos of Caxamarca, on the western\r\ndeclivity of the Peruvian Cordilleras.  The travertine of Van Diemen's Land\r\n(near Hobart Town) contains, according to Charles Darwin, remains of a\r\nvegetation that no longer exists.  Lava and travertine, which are constantly\r\nforming before our eyes, present us with the two extremes of geognostic\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n'Salses' deserve more attention than they have hitherto received from\r\ngeognosists.  Their grandeur has been overlooked because of the two\r\nconditions to which they are subject; it is only the more peaceful state, in\r\nwhich they may continue for centuries, which has generally been described:\r\ntheir origin is, however, accompanied by earthquakes, subterranean thunder,\r\nthe elevation of a whole district, and lofty emissions of flame of short\r\nduration.  When the mud volcano of Jokmali began to form on the 27th of\r\nNovember, 1827, in the peninsula of Abscheron, on the Caspian Sea, east of\r\nBaku, the flames flashed up to an extraordinary height for three hours,\r\nwhile during the next twenty hours they scarcely rose three feet above the\r\ncrater, from which mud was ejected.  Near the village of Baklichli, west of\r\nBaku, the flames rose so high that\r\np 225\r\nthey could be seen at a distance of twenty-four miles.  Enormous masses of\r\nrock were torn up and scattered around.  Similar masses may be seen round\r\nthe now inactive mud volcano of Monte Ziblo, near Sassuolo, in Northern\r\nItaly.  The secondary condition of repose has been maintained for upward of\r\nfifteen centuries in the mud volcanoes of Girgenti, the 'Macalubi', in\r\nSicily, which have been described by the ancients.  These salses consist of\r\nmany contitiguous conical hills, from eight to ten, or even thirty feet in\r\nheight, subject to variations of elevation as well as of form.  Streams of\r\nargillaceous mud, attended by a periodic development of gas, flow from the\r\nsmall basins at the summits, which are filled with water; the mud, although\r\nusualy cold is sometimes at a high temperature, as at Damak, in the province\r\nof Samarang, in the island of Java.  The gases that are developed with loud\r\nnoise differ in their nature consisting for instance, of hydrogen mixed with\r\nnaphtha, or of carbonic acid, or, as Parrot and myself have shown (in the\r\npeninsula of Taman, and in the 'Volcancitos de Turbaco', in South America),\r\nof almost pure nitrogen.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Rel.

The\r\ncommunication with the deep strata in which a high temperature prevails is\r\nsoon closed, and the coldness of the mud emissions of the salses seems to\r\nindicate that the seat of the phenomenon can not be far removed from the\r\nsurface during their ordinary condition.  The reaction of the interior of\r\nthe earth on its external surface is exhibited with totally different force\r\nin true volcanoes or igneous mountains, at points of the earth in which a\r\npermanent, or, at least, continually-renewed connection with the volcanic\r\nforce is manifested.  We must here carefully distinguish between the more or\r\nless intensely developed volcanic phenomena, as for instance, between\r\nearthquakes, thermal, aqueous, and gaseous springs, mud volcanoes, and the\r\nappearance of bell-formed or dome-shaped trachytic rocks without openings;\r\nthe opening of these rocks, or of the elevated beds of basalt, as\r\np 226\r\ncraters of elevation; and, lastly, the elevation of a permanent volcano in\r\nthe crater of elevation, or among the 'debris' of its earlier formation.  At\r\ndifferent periods, and in different degrees of activity and force, the\r\npermanent volcanoes emit steam acids, luminous scoriae, or, when the\r\nresistance can be overcome, narrow, band-like streams of molten earths.\r\nElastic vapors sometimes elevate either separate portions of the earth's\r\ncrust into dome-shaped unopened masses of feldspathic trachyte and dolerite\r\n(as in Puy de Dome and Chimborazo), in consequence of some great or local\r\nmanifestation of force in the interior of our planet, or the upheaved strata\r\nare broken through and curved in such a manner as to form a steep rocky\r\nledge on the opposite inner side, which then constitutes the inclosure of a\r\ncrater of elevation.  If this rocky ledge has been uplifted from the bottom\r\nof the sea, which is by no means always the case, it determines the whole\r\nphysiognomy and form of the island.  In this manner has arisen the circular\r\nform of Palma, which has been described with such admirable accuracy by\r\nLeopold von Buch, and that of Nisyros,* in the Aegean sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the interesting little map of the island of Nisyros, in\r\nRoise's 'Reisen auf den Griechischen Inseln', bd. ii., 1843, s. 69.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes half of the annular ledge has been destroyed, and in the bay\r\nformed by the encroachment of the sea corallines have built their cellular\r\nhabitations.  Even on continents craters of elevation are often filled with\r\nwater, and embellish in a peculiar manner the character of the landscape.\r\nTheir origin is not connected with any determined species of rock:  they\r\nbreak out in basalt, trachyte, leucitic porphyry (somma), or in doleritic\r\nmixtures of augite and labradorite; and hence arise the different nature and\r\nexternal conformation of these inclosures of craters.  No phenomena of\r\neruption are manifested in such craters, as they open no permanent channel\r\nof communication with the interior, and it is but seldom that we meet with\r\ntraces of volcanic activity either in the neighborhood or in the interior of\r\nthese craters.  The force which was able to produce so important an action\r\nmust have been long accumulating in the interior before it could overpower\r\nthe resistance of the mass pressing upon it; it sometimes, for instance, on\r\nthe origin of new islands, will raise granular rocks and conglomerated\r\nmasses (strata of tufa filled with marine plants) above the surface of the\r\nsea.  The compressed vapors escape through the crater of elevation, but a\r\nlarge mass soon falls back and closes the opening, which had been only\r\nformed by these manifestations of force.  No volcano can, therefore,\r\np\r\nbe produced.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leopold von Buch, 'Phys. Beschreibung der Canarischen Inseln',\r\ns. 326; and his Memoir 'uber Erhebungscratere und Vulcane', in Poggend.,\r\n'Annal.', bd. xxxvii., s. 169.\r\nIn his remarks on the separation of Sicily from Calabria, Strbo gives an\r\nexcellend description of the two modes in which islands are formed:  \"Some\r\nislands,\" he observes (lib. vi., p. 258, ed. Casaub.), \"are fragments of the\r\ncontinent, others have arisen from the sea, as even at the present time is\r\nknown to happen; for the islands of the great ocean, lying far from the main\r\nland, have probably been raised from its depths, while, on the other hand,\r\nthose near promontories appear (according to reason) to have been separated\r\nfrom the continent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA volcano, properly so called, exists only where a permanent connection is\r\nestablished between the interior of the earth and the atmosphere, and the\r\nreaction of the interior on the surface then continues during long periods\r\nof time.  It may be interrupted for centuries, as in the case of Vesuvius\r\nFisove,* and then manifest itself with renewed activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Ocre Fisove (Mons Vesuvius) in the Umbrian language.  (Lassen\r\n'Deutung der Eugubinischen Tafeln in Rhein. Museum', 1832, s. 387.)  The\r\nword 'ochre' is very probaby genuine Umbrian, and means, according to\r\nFestus, 'mountain'.  Aetna would be a burning and shining mountain, if Voss\r\nis correct in stating that [Greek work] is an Hellenic sound, and is\r\nconnected with [Greed word] and [Greek word]; but the intelligent writer\r\nParthey doubts this Hellenic origin on etymological grounds, and also\r\nbecause etna was by no means regarded as a luminous beacon for ships or\r\nwanderers, in the same manner as the ever-travailing Stromboli (Strongyle),\r\nto which Homer seems to refer in the Odyssey (xii., 68, 202, and 219), and\r\nits geographical position was not so well determined.  I suspect that tna\r\nwould be found to be a Sicilian word, if we had any fragmentary materials to\r\nrefer to.  According to Diodorus (v., 6), the Sicani, or aborigines\r\npreceding the Sicilians, were compelled to fly to the western part of the\r\nisland, in the consequence of successive eruptions extending over many\r\nyears.  The most ancient eruption of Mount Aetna on record is that mentioned\r\nby Pindar and Schylus, as occurring under Hiero, in the second year of the\r\n75th Olympiad.  It is probable that Hesiod was aware of the devastating\r\neruptions of Aetna before the period of Greek immigration.  There is,\r\nhowever, some doubt regarding the work [Greek word] in the text of Hesiod, a\r\nsubject into whci I have entered at some length in another place.\r\n(Humboldt, 'Examen Crit. de le Geogr.', t. i., p. 168.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the time of Nero, men were disposed to rank Aetna among the volcanic\r\nmountains which were graduallybecoming extinct,* and subsequently Aelian**\r\neven maintained that mariners could no longer see the sinking summit of the\r\nmountain from so great a distance at sea.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Seaeca.  'Epist.', 79.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** Aelian, 'Var. Hist.', viii., 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere these evidences -- these old scaffoldings of eruption, I might almost\r\nsay -- still exist, the volcano rises from a crater of elevation, while a\r\nhigh rocky wall surrounds, like an amphitheater, the isolated conical mount,\r\nand forms around it a kind of easing of highly elevated\r\np 228\r\nstrata.  Occasionally not a trace of this inclosure is visible, and the\r\nvolcano, which is not always conical rises immediately from the neighboring\r\nplateau in an elongated form, as in the case of Pichincha,* at the foot of\r\nwhich lies the city of Quito.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[This mountain contains two funnel-shaped craters, apparently\r\nresulting from two set of eruptions:  the western nearly circular, and\r\nhaving in its center a cone of eruption, from the summit and sides of which\r\nare no less than seventy vents, some in activity and others extinct.  It is\r\nprobable that the larger number of the vents were produced at periods\r\nanterior to history.  Caubney, op. cit., p. 488.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the nature of rocks, or the mixture (grouping) of simple minerals into\r\ngranite, gneiss, and mica slate, or into trachyte, basalt, and dolorite, is\r\nindependent of existing climates, and is the same under the most varied\r\nlatitudes of the earth, so also we find every where in inorganic nature that\r\nthe same laws of configuration regulate the reciprocal superposition of the\r\nstrata of the earth's crust, cause them to penetrate one another in the form\r\nof veins, and elevate them by the agency of elastic forces.  This constant\r\nrecurrence of the same phenomena is most strikingly manifested in volcanoes.\r\n When the mariner, amid the islands of some distant archipelago, is no\r\nlonger guided by the light of the same stars with which he had been familiar\r\nin his native latitude, and sees himself surrounded by palms and other forms\r\nof an exotic vegetation, he still can trace, reflected in the individual\r\ncharacteristics of the landscape, the forms of Vesuvius, of the come-shaped\r\nsummits of Auvergne, the craters of elevation in the Canaries and Azores, or\r\nthe fissures of eruption in Iceland.  A glance at the satellite of our\r\nplanet will impart a wider generalization to this analogy of configuration.\r\nby means of the charts that have been drawn in accordance with the\r\nobservations made with large telescopes, we may recognize in the moon, where\r\nwater and air are both absent, vast craters of elevation surrounding or\r\nsupporting conical mountains, thus affording incontrovertible evidence of\r\nthe effects produced by the reaction of the interior on the surface, favored\r\nby the influence of a feebler force of gravitation.\r\n\r\nAlthough vocanoes are justy termed in many languages \"fire-emitting\r\nmountains,\" mountains of this kind are not formed by the gradual\r\naccumulation of ejected currents of lava, but their origin seems rather to\r\nbe a general consequence of the sudden elevation of soft masses of trachyte\r\nor labradoritic augite.  The amount of the elevating force is manifested\r\np 229\r\nby the elevation of the volcano, which varies from the inconsiderable height\r\nof a hill (as the volcano of Cosima, one of the Japanese Kurile islands) to\r\nthat of a cone above 19,000 feet in height.  It has appeared to me that\r\nrelations of height have a great influence on the occurrence of eruptions,\r\nwhich are more frequent in low than in elevated volcanoes.  I might instance\r\nthe series presented by the following mountains:  Stromboli, 2318 feet;\r\nGuacamayo, in the province of Quixos, from which detonations are heard\r\nalmost daily (I myself often heard them at Chillo, near Quito, a distance of\r\neighty-eight miles); Vesuvius, 3876 feet; Aetna, 10871 feet; the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, 12,175 feet; and Cotopaxi, 19,069 feet.  If the focus of these\r\nvolcanoes be at an equal depth below the surface, a greater force must be\r\nrequired where the fused masses have to be raised to an elevation six or\r\neight times greater than that of the lower eminences.  While the volcano\r\nStromboli (Strongyle) has been incessantly active since the Homeric ages,\r\nand has served as a beacon-light to guide the mariner in the Tyrrhenian Sea,\r\nloftier volcanoes have been characterized by loong intervals of quiet.  Thus\r\nwe see that a whole century often intervenes between the eruptions of most\r\nof the colossi which crown the summits of the Cordilleras of the Andes.\r\nWhere we meet with exceptions to this law, to which I long since drew\r\nattention, they must depend upon the circumstance that the connections\r\nbetween the volcanic foci and the crater of eruption can not be considered\r\nas equaly permanent in the case of all volcanoes.  The channel of\r\ncommunication may be closed for a time in the case of the lower ones, so\r\nthat they less frequently come to a state of eruption, although they do not,\r\non that account, approach more nearly to their final extinction.\r\n\r\nThese relations between the absolute height and the frequency of volcanic\r\neruptions, as far as they are externally perceptible, are intimately\r\nconnected with the consideration of the local conditions under which lava\r\ncurrents are erupted.  Eruptions from the crater are very unusual in many\r\nmountains, generally occurring from lateral fissures (as was observed in the\r\ncase of Aetna, in the sixteenth century, by the celebrated historian Bembo,\r\nwhen a youth*), whenever the sides\r\np 230\r\nof the upheaved mountain were least able, from their configuration and\r\nposition, to offer any resistance.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Petri Bembi Opuscula ('Aetna Dialogus'), Basil, 1556, p. 63:\r\n\"Quicquid in Aetnae matris utero coulescit, nunquam exit ex cratere\r\nsuperiore, quod vel eo inscondere gravis materia non queat, vel, quia\r\ninferius alia spiramenta sunt, non fit opus.  Despumant flammis urgentibus\r\nignei rivi pigro fluxu totas delambentes plagas, et in lapidem indurescunt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCones of eruption are sometimes uplifted on these fissures; the larger ones,\r\nwhich are erroneously termed 'new volcanoes', are ranged together in line\r\nmarking the direction of a fissure, which is soon reclosed, while the\r\nsmaller ones are grouped together covering a whole district with their\r\ndome-like or hive-shaped forms.  To the latter belong the 'hornitos de\r\nJorullo',I the cone of Vesuvius erupted in October, 1822, that of Awatscha,\r\naccording to Postels, and those of the lava-field mentioned by Erman, near\r\nthe Baidar Mountains, in the peninsula of Kamtschatka.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  See my drawing of the volcano of Jorullo, of its 'hornitos', and\r\nof the uplifted 'malpays', in my 'Vues de Cordilleres', pl. xliii., p. 239.\r\n[Burckhardt states that during the twenty-four years that have intervened\r\nsince Baron Humboldt's visit to Jorullo, the 'hornitos' have either wholly\r\ndisappeared or completely changed their forms.  See 'Aufenthalt und Reisen\r\nin Mexico in 1825 und 1834'.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen volcanoes are not isolated in a plain, but surrounded, as in the double\r\nchain of the Andes of Quito, by a table-land having an elevation from nine\r\nto thirteen thousand feet, this circumstance may probably explain the cause\r\nwhy no lava streams are formed* during the most dreadful eruption of ignited\r\nscoriae accompanied by detonations heard at a distance of more than a\r\nhundred miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Humboldt, 'Essaii sur la Geogr. des Plantes et Tableau Phys.\r\ndes Regions Equinoxiales', 1807, p. 130, and 'Essai Geogn. sur le Gisement\r\ndes Roches', p. 321.  Most of the volcanoes in Java demonstrate that the\r\ncause of the perfect absence of lava streams in volcanoes of incessant\r\nactivity is not alone to be sought for in their form, position, and height.\r\nLeop. von Buch, 'Descr. Phys. des Iles Canaries', p. 419; Reinwardt and\r\nHoffmann, in Poggened., 'Annalen.', bd. xii., s. 607.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the volcanoes of Popayan, those of the elevated plateau of Los\r\nPastos and of the Andes of Quito, with the exception, perhaps, in the case\r\nof the latter, of the volcano of Antisana.  The height of the cone of\r\ncinders, and the size and form of the crater, are elements of configuration\r\nwhich yield an especial and individual character to volcanoes, although the\r\ncone of cinders and the crater are both wholly independent of the dimensions\r\nof the mountain.  Vesuvius is more than three times lower than the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe; its cone of cinders rises to one third of the height of the whole\r\nmountain, while the cone of cinders of the Peak is only 1/22d of its\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * [It may be remarked in general, although the rule is liable to\r\nexceptions, that the dimensions of a crater are in an inverse ratio to the\r\nelevation of the mountain.  Daubeney, op. Cit., p. 444.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a much higher volcano than that of Teneriffe, the Rueu Pichincha, other\r\nrelations occur\r\np 231\r\nwhich approach more nearly to that of Vesuvius.  Among all the volcanoes\r\nthat I have seen in the two hemispheres, the conical form of Cotopaxi is the\r\nmost beautifully regular.  A sudden fusion of the snow at its cone of\r\ncinders announces the proximity of the eruption.  Before the smoke is\r\nvisible in the rarefied strata of air surrounding the summit and the opening\r\nof the crater, the walls of the cone of cinders are sometimes in a state of\r\nglowing heat, when the whole mountain presents an appearance of the most\r\nfearful and portentous blackness.  The crater, which, with very few\r\nexceptions, occupies the summit of the volcano, forms a deep, caldron-like\r\nvalley, which is often accessible, and whose bottom is subject to constant\r\nalterations.  The great or lesser depth of the crater is in many volcanoes\r\nlikewise a sign of the near or distant occurrence of an eruption.  Long,\r\nnarrow fissures, from which vapors issue forth, or small rounding hollows\r\nfilled with molten masses, alternately open and close in the caldron-like\r\nvalley; the bottom rises and sinks, eminences of scoriae and cones of\r\neruption are formed, rising sometimes far over the walls of the crater, and\r\ncontinuing for years together to impart to the volcano a peculiar character,\r\nand then suddenly fall together and disappear during a new eruption.  The\r\nopenings of these cones of eruption, which rise from the bottom of the\r\ncrater, must not, as is too often done, be confounded with the crater which\r\nincloses them.  If this be inaccessible from extreme depth and from the\r\nperpendicular descent, as in the case of the volcano of Rucu Pichincha,\r\nwhich is 15,920 feet in height, the traveler may look from the edge on the\r\nsummit of the mountains which rise in the sulphurous atmosphere of the\r\nvalley at his feet; and I have never beheld a grander or more remarkable\r\npicture than that presented by this volcano.  In the interval between two\r\neruptions, a crater may either present no luminous appearance, showing\r\nmerely open fissures and ascending vapors, or the scarcely heated soil may\r\nbe covered by eminences of scoriae, that admit of being approached without\r\ndanger, and thus present to the geologist the spectacle of the eruption of\r\nburning and fused masses, which fall back on the ledge of the cone of\r\nscoriae, and whose appearance is regularly announced by small wholly local\r\nearthquakes.  Lava sometimes streams forth from the open fissures and small\r\nhollows, without breaking through or escaping beyond the sides of the\r\ncrater.  If, however, it does break through, the newly-opened terrestrial\r\nstream generally flows in such a quiet and well-defined course, that the\r\ndeep valley, which we term the crater, remains accessible\r\np 232\r\neven during periods of eruption.  It is impossible, without an exact\r\nrepresentation of the configuration -- the normal type, as it were, of\r\nfire-emitting mountains, to form a just idea of those phenomena which, owing\r\nto fantastic descriptions and an undefined phraseology, have long been\r\ncomprised under the head of 'craters, cones of eruption', and 'volcanoes'.\r\nThe marginal ledges of craters vary much less than one would be led to\r\nsuppose.  A comparison of Saussure's measurements with my own yields the\r\nremarkable result, for instance, that in the course of forty-nine years\r\n(from 1773 to 1822), the elevation of the northwestern margin of Mount\r\nVesuvius ('Rocca del Palo') may be considered to have remained unchanged.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the ground-work of my measurements compared with those of\r\nSaussure and Lord Minto, in the 'Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wiss. zu\r\nBerlin' for the years 1822 and 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolcanoes which, like the chain of the Andes, lift their summits high above\r\nthe boundaries of the region of perpetual snow, present peculiar phenomena.\r\nThe masses of snow, by their sudden fusion during eruptions, occasion not\r\nonly the most fearful inundations and torrents of water, in which smoking\r\nscoriae are borne along on thick masses of ice, but they likewise exercise a\r\nconstant action, while the volcano is in a state of perfect repose, by\r\ninfiltration into the fissures of the trachytic rock.  Cavities which are\r\neither on the declivity or at the foot of the mountain are gradually\r\nconverted into subterranean resevoirs of water, which communicate by\r\nnumerous narrow openings with mountain streams, as we see exemplified in the\r\nhighlands of Quito.  the fishes of these rivulets multiply, especially in\r\nthe obscurity of the hollows; and when the shocks of earthquakes, which\r\nprecede all eruptions in the andes, have violently shaken the whole mass of\r\nthe volcano, these subterranean caverns are suddenly opened, and water,\r\nfishes, and tufaceous mud are all ejected together.  It is through this\r\nsingular phenomenon* that the inhabitants of the highlands of Quito became\r\nacquainted with the existence of the little cyclopic fishes, termed by them\r\nthe prenadilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Pimelodes cyclopum.  See Humboldt, 'Recueil d'Observations de\r\nZoologie et d'Anatomie Comparee', t. i., p. 21-25.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night between the 19th and 20th of June, 1698, when the summit of\r\nCarguairazo, a mountain 19,720 feet in height, fell in, leaving only two\r\nhuge masses of rock remaining of the ledge of the crater, a space of nearly\r\nthirty-two square miles was overflowed and devastated by streams of liquid\r\ntufa and argillaceous mud ('lodazales'), containing large quantities of dead\r\nfish.\r\np 233\r\nIn like manner, the putrid fever, which raged seven years previously in the\r\nmountain town of Ibarra, north of Quito, was ascribed to the ejection of\r\nfish from the volcano of Imbaburu.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[It would appear, as there is no doubt that these fishes\r\nproceed from the mountain itself, that there must be large lakes in the\r\ninterior, which in ordinary season are out of the immediate influence of the\r\nvolcanic action.  See Daubeney, op. cit., p. 488, 497.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater and mud, which flow not from the crater itself, but from the hollows\r\nin the trachytic mass of the mountain, can not, strictly speaking, be\r\nclassed among volcanic phenomena.  They are only indirectly connected with\r\nthe volcanic activity of the mountain, resembling, in that respect, the\r\nsingular meteorological process which I have designated in my earlier\r\nwritings by the term of 'volcanic storm'.  The hot stream which rises from\r\nthe crater during the eruption and spreads itself in the atmosphere,\r\ncondenses into a cloud, and surrounds the column of fire and cinders which\r\nrises to an altitude of many thousand feet.  The sudden condensation of the\r\nvapors, and, as Gay-Lussac has shown, the formation of a cloud of enormous\r\nextent, increase the electric tension.  Forked lightning flashes from the\r\ncolumn of cinders, and it is then easy to distinguish (as at the close of\r\nthe eruption of Mount Vesuvius, in the latter end of October, 1822) the\r\nrolling thunder of the volcanic storm from the detonations in the interior\r\nof the mountain.  the flashes of lightning that darted from the volcanic\r\ncloud of steam, as we learn from Olafsen's report, killed eleven horses and\r\ntwo men, on the eruption of the volcano of Katlagia, in Iceland, on the 17th\r\nof October, 1755.\r\n\r\nHaving thus delineated the structure and dynamic activity of volcanoes, it\r\nnow remains for us to throw a glance at the differences existing in their\r\nmaterial products.  The subterranean forces sever old combinations of matter\r\nin order to produce new ones, and they also continue to act upon matter as\r\nlong as it is in a state of liquefaction from heat, and capable of being\r\ndisplaced.  The greater or less pressure under which merely softened or\r\nwholly liquid fluids are solidified, appears to constitute the main\r\ndifference in the formation of Plutonic and volcanic rocks.  The mineral\r\nmass which flows in narrow, elongated streams from a volcanic opening (an\r\nearth-spring), is called lava.  where many such currents meet and are\r\narrested in their course, they expand in width, filling large basins, in\r\nwhich they become solidified in superimposed strata.  These few sentences\r\ndescribe the general character of the products of volcanic activity.\r\n\r\np 234\r\nRocks which are merely broken through by the volcanic action are often\r\ninclosed in the igneous products.  Thus i have found angular fragments of\r\nfeldspathic syenite imbedded in the black augitic lava of the volcano of\r\nJorullo, in Mexico; but the masses of dolomite and granular limestone, which\r\ncontain magnificent clusters of crystalling fossils (vesuvian and garnets,\r\ncovered with mejonite, nepheline, and sodalite), are not the ejected\r\nproducts of Vesuvius, these belonging rather to very generally distributed\r\nformations, viz., strata of tufa, which are more ancient than the elevation\r\nof the Somma and of Vesuvius, and are probably the products of a deep-seated\r\nand concealed submarine volcanic action.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxvii., s. 179.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find five metals among the products of existing volcanoes, iron, copper,\r\nlead, arsenic, and selenium, discovered by Stromeyer in the crater of\r\nVolcano.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[The little island of Volcano is separated from Lipari by a\r\nnarrow channel.  It appears to have exhibited strong signs of volcanic\r\nactivity long before the Christian era, and still emits gaseous exhalations.\r\n Stromeyer detected the presence of selenium in a mixture of sal ammoniac\r\nand sulphur.  Another product, supposed to be peculiar to this volcano, is\r\nboracic acid, which lines the sides of the cavities in beautiful white silky\r\ncrystals.  Daubeney, op. cit., p. 257.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vapors that rise from the 'fumarolles' cause the sublimation of the\r\nchlorids of iron, copper, lead, and ammonium; iron glanceI and chlorid of\r\nsodium (the latter often in large quantities) fill the cavities of recent\r\nlava streams and the fissures of the margin of the crater.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Regarding the chemical origin of iron glance in volcanic\r\nmasses, see Mitscherlich, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xv., s. 630; and on\r\nthe liberation of hydrochloric acid in the crater, see Gay-Lussac, in the\r\n'Annals de Chimique et de Physique', t. xxii., p. 423.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mineral composition of lava differs according to the nature of the\r\ncrystalline rock of which the volcano is formed, the height of the point\r\nwhere the eruption occurs, whether at the foot of the mountain or in the\r\nneighborhood of the crater, and the condition of temperature of the\r\ninterior.  Vitreous volcanic formations, obsidian, pearl-stone, and pumice,\r\nare entirely wanting in some volcanoes, while in the case of others they\r\nonly proceed from the crater, or, at any rate, from very considerable\r\nheights.  These important and involved relations can only be explained by\r\nvery accurate crystallographic and chemical investigations.  My\r\nfellow-traveler in Siberia, Gustav Rose, and subsequently Hermann Abich,\r\nhave already been able, by their fortunate and ingenious researches, to\r\nthrow much light on the structural relations of the various kinds of\r\nvolcanic rocks.\r\n\r\np 235\r\nThe greater part of the ascending vapor is mere steam.  When condensed, this\r\nforms springs, as in Pantellaria,Iwhere they are used by the goatherds of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[Steam issues from many parts of this insular mountain, and\r\nseveral hot springs gush forth from it, which form together a lake 6000 feet\r\nin circumference.  Daubeney, op. cit.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 26th of October, 1822, a current was seen to flow from\r\na lateral fissure of the crater of Vesuvius, and was loong supposed to have\r\nbeen boiling water; it was, however, shown, by Monticelli's accurate\r\ninvestigations, to consist of dry ashes, which fell like sand, and of lava\r\npulverized by friction.  The ashes, which sometimes darken the air for hours\r\nand days together, and produce great injury to the vineyards and olive\r\ngroves by adhering to the leaves, indicate by their columnar ascent,\r\nimpelled by vapors, the termination of every great eqrthquake.  This is the\r\nmagnificent phenomenon which Pliny the younger, in his celebrated letter to\r\nCornelius Tacitus, compares, in the case of Vesuvius, to the form of a lofty\r\nand thickly-branched and foliaceous pine.  That which is described as flames\r\nin the eruption of scoriae, and the radiance of the glowing red clouds that\r\nhover over the crater, can not be ascribed to the effect of hydrogen gas in\r\na state of combustion.  They are rather reflections of light which issue\r\nfrom molten masses, projected high in the air, and also reflections from the\r\nburning depths, whence the glowing vapors ascend.  We will not, however,\r\nattempt to decide the nature of the flames, which are occasionally seen now,\r\nas in the time of Strabo, to rise from the deep sea during the activity of\r\nlittoral volcanoes, or shortly before the elevation of a volcanic island.\r\n\r\nWhen the questions are asked, what is it that burns in the volcano? what\r\nexcites the heat, fuses together earths and metals, and imparts to lava\r\ncurrents of thick layers a degree of heat that lasts for many years? it is\r\nnecessarily implied that volcanoes must be connected with the existence of\r\nsubstances capable of maintaining combustion, like the beds of coal in\r\nsubterranean fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the beautiful experiments on the cooling of masses of rock,\r\nin Bischof's 'Warmelehre', s. 384, 443, 500-512.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the different phases of chemical science, bitumen, pyrites, the\r\nmoist admixture of finely-pulverized sulphur and iron, pyrophoric\r\nsubstances, and the metals of the alkalies and earths, have in turn been\r\ndesignated as the cause of intensely active volcanic phenomena.  The great\r\nchemist, Sir Humphrey Davy, to whom we are indebted for the knowledge of the\r\nmost combustible metallic\r\np 236\r\nsubstances, has himself renounced his bold chemical hypothesis in his last\r\nwork ('Consolation in Travel, and last Days of a Philosopher') -- a work\r\nwhich can not fail to excite in the reader a feeling of the deepest\r\nmelancholy.  the great mean density of the earth (5.44), when compared with\r\nthe specific weight of potassium (0.865), of sodium (-.972), or of the\r\nmetals of the earths (1.2), and the absence of hydrogen gas in the gaseous\r\nemanations from the fissures of craters, and from still warm streams of\r\nlava, besides many chemical considerations, stand in opposition with the\r\nearlier conjectures of Davy and Ampere.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Berzelius and Wohler, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. i., s.\r\n221, and bd. xi., s. 146; Gay-Lussac, in the 'Annals de Chimie', t. x.,\r\nxii., p. 422; and Bischof's 'Reasons against the Chemical Theory of\r\nVolcanoes', in the English edition of his 'Warmelehre', p. 297-309.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf hydrogen were evolved from erupted lava, how great must be the quantity\r\nof the gas disengaged, when, the seat of the volcanic activity being very\r\nlow, as in the case of the remarkable eruption at the foot of the Skaptar\r\nJokul in Iceland (from the 11th of June to the 3d of August, 1783, described\r\nby Mackenzie and Soemund Magnussen), a space of many square miles was\r\ncovered by streams of lava, accumulated to the thickness of several hundred\r\nfeet!  Similar difficulties are opposed to the assumption of the penetration\r\nof the atmospheric air into the crater, or, as it is figuratively expressed,\r\nthe 'inhalation of the earth', when we have regard to the small quantity of\r\nnitrogen emitted.  So general, deep-seated, and far-propagated an activity\r\nas that of volcanoes, can not assuredly have its source in chemical\r\naffinity, or in the mere contact of individual or merely locally distributed\r\nsubstances.  Modern geognosy* rather seeks the cause of this activity in the\r\nincreased temperature with the increase of depth at all degrees of latitude,\r\nin that powerful internal heat which our planet owes to its first\r\nsolidification, its formation in the regions of space, and to the spherical\r\ncontraction of\r\np 237\r\nmatter revolving elliptically in a gaseous condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[On the various theories that have been advanced in explanation\r\nof volcanic action, see Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', a work to which we have\r\nmade continual reference during the preceding pages, as it constitutes the\r\nmost recent and perfect compendium of all the important facts relating to\r\nthis subject, and is peculiarly adapted to serve as a source of reference to\r\nthe 'Cosmos', since the learned author in many instances enters into a full\r\nexposition of the views advanced by Baron Humboldt.  The appendix contains\r\nseveral valuable notes with reference to the most recent works that have\r\nappeared on the Continent, on subjects relating to volcanoes; among others,\r\nan interesting notice of Professor Bischof's views \"on the origin of the\r\ncarbonic acid discharged from volcanoes,\" as enounced in his recently\r\npublished work, 'Lehrbuch der Chemischen und Physikalischen Geologie'.] --\r\nTr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have thus mere conjecture and supposition side by side with certain\r\nknowledge.  A philosophical study of nature strives ever to elevate itself\r\nabove the narrow requirements of mere natural description, and does not\r\nconsist, as we have already remarked, in the mere accumulation of isolated\r\nfacts.  The inquiring and active spirit of man must be suffered to pass from\r\nthe present to the past, to conjecture all that can not yet be known with\r\ncertainty, and still to dwell with pleasure on the ancient myths of geognosy\r\nwhich are presented to us under so many various forms.  If we consider\r\nvolcanoes as irregular intermittent springs, emitting a fluid mixture of\r\noxydized metals, alkalies, and earths, flowing gently and calmy wherever\r\nthen find a passage, or being upheaved by the powerful expansive force of\r\nvapors, we are involuntarily led to remember the geognostic visions of\r\nPlato, according to which hot springs, as well as all volcanic igneous\r\nstreams, were eruptions that might be traced back to one generally\r\ndistributed subterranean cause, 'Pyriphlegethon'.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *According to Plato's geognostic views, as developed in the\r\n'Phaedo', Pyriphlegethon plays much the same part in relation to the\r\nactivity of volcanoes that we now ascribe to the augmentation of heat as we\r\ndescend from the earth's surface, and to the fused condition of its internal\r\nstrata.  ('Phaedo', ed. Ast, p. 603 and 607; Annot., p. 308 and 817.)\r\n\"Within the earth, and all around it, are larger and smaller caverns.  Water\r\nflows there in abundance; also much fire and large streams of fire, and\r\nstreams of moist mud (some purer and others more filthy), like those in\r\nSicily, consisting of mud and fire, preceding the great eruption.  These\r\nstreams fill all places that fall in the way of their course.\r\nPyriphlegethon flows forth into an extensive district burning with a fierce\r\nfire, where it forms a lake larger than our sea, boiling with water and mud.\r\n From thence it moves in circles round the earth, turbid and muddy.\"  This\r\nstream of molten earth and mud is so much the general cause of volcanic\r\nphenomena, that Plato expressly adds, \"thus is Pyriphlegethon constituted,\r\nfrom which also the streams of fire ([Greek words]), wherever they reach the\r\nearth ([Greek words]), inflate such parts (detached fragments).\"  Volcanic\r\nscoriae and lava streams are therefore portions of Pyriphlegethon itself,\r\nportions of the subterranean molten and ever-undulating mass.  That {Greek\r\nwords] are lava streams, and not, as Schneider, Passow, and Schleiermacher\r\nwill have it, \"fire-vomiting mountains,\" is clear enough from many passages,\r\nsome of which have been collected by Ukert ('Geogr. der Griechen und Romer',\r\nth. ii., s. 200): [Greek word] is the volcanic phenomenon in reference to\r\nits most striking characteristic, the lava stream. Hence the expression, the\r\n[Greek word] of Aetna.  Aristot. 'Mirab. Ausc.', t. ii., p. 833; sect. 38,\r\nBekker; Thucyd., iii., 116; Theophrast., 'De Lap'., 22, p. 427, Schneider;\r\nDiod., v., 6, and xiv., 59, where are the remarkable words, \"Many places\r\nnear the sea, in the neighborhood of Aetna, were leveled to the ground,\r\n[Greek words];\"  Strabo, vi., p. 269; xiii., p. 268, and where there is a\r\nnotice of the celebrated burning mud of the Lelantine plains, in Euboea, i.,\r\np. 58, Casaub.; and Appian, 'De Bello Civili', v., 114.  The blame which\r\nAristotle throws on the geognostical fantasies of the Phaedo ('Meteor.',\r\nii., 2, 19) is especially applied to the sources of the rivers flowing over\r\nthe earth's surface.  The distinct statement of Plato, that \"in Sicily\r\neruptions of wet mud precede the glowing (lava) stream,\" is very remarkable.\r\n Observations on Aetna could not have led to such a statement, unless pumice\r\nand ashes, formed into a mud-like mass by admixture with melted snow and\r\nwater, during the volcano-electric storm in the crater of eruption, were\r\nmistaken for ejected mud.  It is more probable that Plato's streams of moist\r\nmud ([Greek words]) originated in a faint recollection of the salses (mud\r\nvolcanoes) of Agrigentum, which, as I have already mentioned, eject\r\nargillaceous mud with a loud noise.  It is much to be regretted, in\r\nreference to this subject, that the work of Theophrastus [Greek words] 'On\r\nthe Volcanic Stream in Sicily', to which Diog. Laert., v., 49, refers, has\r\nnot come down to us.\r\n\r\n\r\np 238\r\nThe different volcanoes over the earth's surface, when they are considered\r\nindependently of all climatic differences, are acutely and\r\ncharacteristically classified as central and linear volcanoes.  Under the\r\nfirst name are comprised those which constitute the central point of many\r\nactive mouths of eruption, distributed almost regularly in all directions;\r\nunder the second, those lying at some little distance from one another,\r\nforming, as it were, chimneys or vents along an extended fissure.  Linear\r\nvolcanoes again admit of further subdivision, namely, those which rise like\r\nseparate conical islands from the bottom of the sea, being generally\r\nparallel with a chain of primitive mountains, whose foot they appear to\r\nindicate, and those volcanic chains which are elevated on the highest ridges\r\nof these mountain chains, of which they form the summits.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leopold von Buch, 'Physikal. Beschreib. der Canarischen\r\nInseln', s. 326-407.  I doubt if we can agree with the ingenious Charles\r\nDarwin ('Geological Observations on Volcanic Islands', 1844, p. 127) in\r\nregarding central volcanoes in general as volcanic chains of small extent on\r\nparallel fissures.  Friedrich Hoffman believes that in the group of the\r\nLipari Islands, which he has so admirably described, and in which two\r\neruption fissures intersect near Panaria, he has found an intermediate link\r\nbetween the two principal modes in which volcanoes appear, namely, the\r\ncentral volcanoes and volcanic chains of Von Buch (Poggendorf, 'Annalen der\r\nPhysik', bd. xxvi., s. 81-88).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peak of Teneriffe, for instance, is a central volcano, being the central\r\npoint of the volcanic group to which the eruption of Palma and Landerote may\r\nbe referred.  The long, rampart-like chain of the Andes, which is sometimes\r\nsingle, and sometimes divided into two or three parallel branches, connected\r\nby various transverse ridges, presents, from the south of Chili to the\r\nnorthwest coast of America, one of the grandest instances of a continental\r\nvolcanic chain.  The proxiimity of\r\np 239\r\nactive volcanoes is always manifested in the chain of the Andes by the\r\nappearance of certain rocks (as dolerite, melaphyre, trachyte, andesite, and\r\ndioritic porphyry), which divide the so-called primitive rocks, the\r\ntransition slates and sandstones, and the stratified formations.  the\r\nconstant recurrence of this phenomenon convinced me long since that these\r\nsporadic rocks were the seat of volcanic phenomena, and were connected with\r\nvolcanic eruptions.  At the foot of the grand Tunguragua, near Penipe, on\r\nthe banks of the Rio Puela, I first distinctly observed mica slate resting\r\non granite, broken through by a volcanic rock.\r\n\r\nIn the volcanic chain of the New Continent, the separate volcanoes are\r\noccasionally, when near together in mutual dependence upon one another; and\r\nit is even seen that the volcanic activity for centuries together has moved\r\non in one and the same direction, as for instance, from north to south in\r\nthe province of Quito.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  (Humboldt, 'Geognost. Beobach, uber die Vulkane des Hochlandes\r\nvon Quito', in Poggend., 'Annal. der Physik', bd. xliv., s. 194.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe focus of the volcanic action lies below the whole of the highlands of\r\nthis province; the only channels of communication with the atmosphere are,\r\nhowever, those mountains which we designate by special names, as the\r\nmountains of Pichincha, Cotopaxi, and Tunguragua, and which, from their\r\ngrouping, elevation, and form, constitute the grandest and most picturesque\r\nspectacle to be found in any volcanic district of an equally limited extent.\r\n Experience shows us, in many instances, that the extremities of such groups\r\nof volcanic chains are connected together by subterranean communications;\r\nand this fact reminds us of the ancient and true expression made use of by\r\nSeneca,* that the igneous mountain is only the issue of the more\r\ndeeply-seated volcanic forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Seneca, while he speaks very clearly regarding the\r\nproblematical sinking of Aetna, says in his 79th letter, \"Though this might\r\nhappen, not because the mountain's height is lowered, but because the fires\r\nare weakened, and do not blaze out with their former vehemence; and for\r\nwhich reason it is that such vast clouds of smoke are not seen in the\r\nday-time.  Yet neither of these seem incredible, for the mountain may\r\npossibly be consumed by being daily devoured, and the fire not be so large\r\nas formerly, since it is not self-generated here, but is kindled in the\r\ndistant bowels of the earth, and there rages, being fed with continual fuel,\r\nnot with that of the mountain, through which it only makes its passage.\"\r\nThe subterranean communication, \"by galleries,\" between the volcanoes of\r\nSicily, Lipari, Pithecusa (Ischia), and Vesuvius, \"of the last of which we\r\nmay conjecture that it formerly burned and presented a fiery circle,\" seems\r\nfully understood by Strabl (lib. i., p. 247 and 248).  He terms the whole\r\ndistrict \"sub-igneous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Mexican highlands a mutual dependence is\r\np 240\r\nalso observed to exist among the volcanic mountains Orizaba, Popocatepel,\r\nJorullo, and Colima; and I have shown* that they all lie in one direction\r\nbetween 18 degrees 59' and 19 degrees 12' north latitude, and are situated\r\nin a transverse fissure running from sea to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Essai Politique sur la Nouv. Espagne', t. ii., p.\r\n173-175.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volcano of Jorullo broke forth on the 29th of September, 1759, exactly\r\nin this direction, and over the same transverse fissure, being elevated to a\r\nheight of 1604 feet above the level of the surrounding plain.  The mountain\r\nonly once emitted an eruption of lava, in the same manner as is recorded of\r\nMount Epomeo in Ischia, in the year 1302.  But although Jorullo, which is\r\neighty miles from any active volcano, is in the strict sense of the word a\r\nnew mountain, it must not be compared with Monte Nuovo, near Puzzuolo, which\r\nfirst appeared on the 19th of September, 1538, and is rather to be classed\r\namong craters of elevation.  I believe that I have furnished a more natural\r\nexplanation of the eruption of the Mexican volcano, in comparing its\r\nappearance to the elevation of the Hill of Methone, now Methana, in the\r\npeninsula of Troezene.  The description given by Strabo and Pausanias of\r\nthis elevation, led one of the Roman poets, most celebrated for his richness\r\nof fancy, to develop views which agree in a remarkable manner with the\r\ntheory of modern geognosy.  \"Near Troezene is a tumulus, steep and devoid of\r\ntrees, once a plain, now a mountain.  The vapors inclosed in dark caverns in\r\nvain seek a passage by which they may escape.  The heavier earth, inflated\r\nby the force of the compressed vapors, expands like a bladder filled with\r\nair, or like a goat-skin.  The ground has remained thus inflated, and the\r\nhigh projecting eminence has been solidified by time into a naked rock.\"\r\nThus picturesquely, and, as analogous phenomena justify us in believing,\r\nthus truly has Ovid described that great natural phenomenon which occurred\r\n282 years before our era, and consequently, 45 years bfore the volcanic\r\nseparation of Thera (Santorino) and Therasia, between Troezene and\r\nEpidaurus, on the same spot where Russegger has found veins of trachyte.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Ovid's description of the eruption of Methone ('Metam.', xv.,\r\np. 226-306):\r\n\"Near Troezene stands a hill, exposed in air\r\nTo winter winds, of leafy shadows bare:\r\nThis once was level ground; but (strange to tell)\r\nTh' included vapors, that in caverns dwell,\r\nLaboring with colic pangs, and close confined,\r\nIn vain sought issue for the rumbling wind:\r\nYet still they heaved for vent, and heaving still,\r\nEnlarged the concave and shot up the hill,\r\nAs breath extends a bladder, or the skins\r\nOf goats are blown t'inclose the hoarded wines;\r\nThe mountain yet retains a mountain's face,\r\nAnd gathered rubbish heads the hollow space.\"\r\n                 'Dryden's Translation'.\r\n[footnote continues]\r\nThis description of a dome-shaped elevation on the continent is of great\r\nimportance in a geognostical point of view, and coincides to a remarkable\r\ndegree with Aristotle's account ('Meteor.', ii., 89, 17-19) of the upheaval\r\nof islands of eruption:  \"The heaving of the earth does not cease till the\r\nwind [(Greek word)] which occasions the shocks has made its escape into the\r\ncrust of the earth.  It is not long ago since this actually happened at\r\nHeraclea in Pontus, and a similar event formerly occurred at Hiera, one of\r\nthe Aeolian Islands.  A portion of the earth swelled up, and with loud noise\r\nrose into the form of a hill, till the mighty urging blast [(Greek word)]\r\nfound an outlet, and ejected sparks and ashes which covered the neighborhood\r\nof Lipari, and even extended to several Italian cities.\"  In this\r\ndescription, the vesicular distension of the earth's crust (a stage at which\r\nmany trachytic mountains have remained) is very well distinguished from the\r\neruption itself.  Strabo, lib. i., p. 59 (Casaubon), likewise describes the\r\nphenomenon as it occurred at Methone:  near the town, in the Bay of\r\nHermione, there arose a flaming eruption; a fiery mountain, seven (?) stadia\r\nin height, was then thrown up, which during the day was inaccessible from\r\nits heat and sulphureous stench, but at night evolved an agreeable odor (?)\r\n, and was so hot that the sea boiled for a distance of five stadia, and was\r\nturbid for full twenty stadia, and also was filled with detached masses of\r\nrock.  Regarding the present mineralogical character of the peninsula of\r\nMethana, see Fiedler, 'Reise durch Griechenland', th. i., s. 257-263.\r\n\r\n\r\np 241\r\nSantorino is the most important of all the 'islands of eruption' belonging\r\nto volcanic chains.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[I am indebted to the kindness of Professor E. Forbes for the\r\nfollowing interesting account of the island of Santorino, and the adjacent\r\nislands of Neokaimeni and Microkaimeni.  \"The aspect of the bay is that of a\r\ngreat crater filled with water, Thera and Therasia forming its walls, and\r\nthe other islands being after-productions in its center.  We sounded with\r\n250 fathoms of line in the middle of the bay, between Therasia and the main\r\nislands, but got no bottom.  Both these islands appear to be similarly\r\nformed of successive strata of volcanic ashes, which, being of the most\r\nvivid and variegated colors, present a striking contrast to the black and\r\ncindery aspect of the central isles.  Neokaimeni, the last-formed island, is\r\na great heap of obsidian and scoriae.  So, also, is the greater mass,\r\nMicrokaimeni, which rises up in a conical form, and has a cavity or crater.\r\nOn one side of this island, however, a section is exposed, and cliffs of\r\nfine pumiceous ash appear stratified in the greater islands.  In the main\r\nisland, the volcanic strata abut against the limestone mass of Mount St.\r\nElias in such a way as to lead to the inference that they were deposited in\r\na sea bottom in which the present mountain rose as a submarine mass of rock.\r\n The people at Santorino assured us that subterranean noises are not\r\nunfrequently heard, especially during calms and south winds, when they say\r\nthe water of parts of the bay becomes the color of sulphur.  My own\r\nimpression is, that this group of islands, constitutes a crater of\r\nelevation, of which the outer ones are the remains of the walls, while the\r\ncentral group are of later origin, and consist partly of upheaved sea\r\nbottoms and partly of erupted matter -- erupted, however, beneath the\r\nsurface of the water.\"] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt combines within itself\r\np 242\r\nthe history of all islands of elevation.  For upward of 2000 years, as far\r\nas history and tradition certify, it would appear as if nature were striving\r\nto form a volcano in the midst of the crater of elevation.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Physik. Beschr. der Canar. Inseln', s.\r\n356-358, and particularly the French translation of this excellent work, p.\r\n402; and his memoir in Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd. xxxviii., s. 183.  A\r\nsubmarine island has quite recently made its appearance within the crater of\r\nSantorino.  In 1810 it was still fifteen fathoms below the surface of the\r\nsea, but in 1830 it had risen to within three or four.  It rises steeply\r\nlike a great cone, from the bottom of the sea, and the continuous activity\r\nof the submarine crater is obvious from the circumstance that sulphurous\r\nacid vapors are mixed with the sea water, in the eastern bay of Neokaimeni,\r\nin the same manner as at Vromolimni, near Methana.  Coppered ships lie at\r\nanchor in the bay in order to get their bottoms cleaned and polished by this\r\nnatural (volcanic) process.  (Virlet, in the 'Bulletin de la Societe\r\nGeologique de France', t. iii., p. 109, and Fiedler 'Reise durch\r\nGriechenland', th. ii., s. 469 and 584.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar insular elevations, and almost always at regular intervals of 80 or\r\n90 years,* have been manifested in the island of St. Michael, in the Azores;\r\nbut in this case the bottom of the sea has not been elevated at exactly the\r\nsame parts.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Appearance of a new island near St. Miguel, one of the Azores,\r\n11th of June, 1638, 31st of December, 1719, 13th of June, 1811.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **[My esteemed friend, Dr. Webster, professor of Chemistry and\r\nMineralogy at Harvard College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U. S., in his\r\n'Description of the Island of St. Michael, etc.', Boston, 1822, gives an\r\ninteresting account of the sudden appearance of the island named Sabrina\r\nwhich was about a mile in circumference, and two or three hundred feet above\r\nthe level of the ocean.  After continuing for some weeks, it sank into the\r\nsea.  Dr. Webster describes the whole of the island of St. Michael as\r\nvolcanic, and containing a number of conical hills of trachyte, several of\r\nwhich have craters, and appear at some former time to have been the openings\r\nof volcanoes.  The hot springs which abound in the island are impregnated\r\nwith sulphureted hydrogen and carbonic acid gases, appearing to attest the\r\nexistence of volcanic action.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island which Captain Tillard named 'Sabrina', appeared unfortunately at\r\na time (the 30th of January, 1811) when the political relations of the\r\nmaritime nations of Western Europe prevented that attention being bestowed\r\nupon the subject by scientific institutions which was afterward directed to\r\nthe sudden appearance (the 2d of July, 1831), and the speedy destruction of\r\nthe igneous island of Ferdinandea in the Sicilian Sea, between the limestone\r\nshores of Sciacca and the purely volcanic island of Pantellaria.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Prevost, in the Bulletin de la Societe Geologique, t. iii., p.\r\n34; Friedrich Hoffman, 'Hinterlassene Werke.' bd. ii., s. 451-456.\r\n\r\n\r\np 243\r\nThe geographical distribution of the volcanoes which have been in a state of\r\nactivity during historical times, the great number of insular and littoral\r\nvolcanic mountains, and the occasional, although ephemeral, eruptions in the\r\nbottom of the sea, early led to the belief that volcanic activity was\r\nconnected with the neighborhood of the sea, and was dependent upon it for\r\nits continuance.  \"For many hundred years,\" says Justinian, or rather Trogus\r\nPompeius, whom he follows,* \"Aetna and the Aeolian Islands have been\r\nburning, and how could this have continued so long if the fire had not been\r\nfed by the\r\np 244\r\nneighboring sea?\"**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"Accedunt vicini et perpetui Aetnae montis ignes et insularum\r\nAeolidum, veluti ipsis undis alatur incendium; neque enim aliter durare tot\r\nseculis tantus ignis potuisset, nisi humoris nutrimentis aleretur.\"\r\n(Justin, 'Hist. Philipp.', iv., i.)  The volcanic theory with which the\r\nphysical description of Sicily here begins is extremely intricate.  Deep\r\nfissured; violent motion of the waves of the sea, which, as they strike\r\ntogether, draw down the air (the wind) for the maintenance of the fire:\r\nsuch are the elements of the theory of Trogus.  Since he seems from Pliny\r\n(xi., 52) to have been a physiognomist, we may presume that his numerous\r\nlost works were not confined to history alone.  The opinion that air is\r\nforced into the interior of the earth, there to act on the vocanic furnaces,\r\nwas connected by the ancients with the supposed influence of winds from\r\ndifferent quarters on the intensity of the fires burning in tna, Hiera, and\r\nStromboli.  (See the remarkable passage in Strabo, liv. vi., Aetna.)  The\r\nmountain island of Stromboli (Strongyle) was regarded therefore, as the\r\ndwelling-place of Aeolus, \"the regulator of the winds,\" in consequence of\r\nthe sailors foretelling the weather from the activity of the volcanic\r\neruptions of this island.  The connection between the eruption of a small\r\nvolcano with the state of the barometer and the direction of the wind is\r\nstill generally recognized (Leop. von Buch, 'Descr. Phys. des Iles\r\nCanaries', p. 334; Hoffmann, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxvi., s. viii),\r\nalthough our present knowledge of volcanic phenomena, and the slight changes\r\nof atmospheric pressure accompanying our winds, do not enable us to offer\r\nany satisfactory explanation of the fact.  Bembo, who during his youth was\r\nbrought up in Sicily by Greek refugees, gave an agreeable narrative of his\r\nwanderings, and in his 'Aetna Dialogus' (written in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century) advances the theory of the penetration of sea water to\r\nthe very center of the volcanic action, and of the necessity of the\r\nproximity of the sea to active volcanoes.  In ascending Aetna the following\r\nquestion was proposed:  \"Explaina potius nobis quae petimus, ea incendia\r\nunde oriantur et orta quomodo perdurent.  In omni tellure nuspiam majores\r\nfistulae aut meatus ampliores sunt quam in locis, quae vel mari vicina sunt,\r\nvel a mari protinus alluntur:  mare erodit illa facillime pergitque in\r\nviscera terrae.

This\r\nmay be seen either by referring to Dr. Boue's map of Europe, or to that\r\npublished by Mr. Lyell in the recent edition of his 'Principles of Geology'\r\n(1847), from both of which it will become apparent that, at a comparatively\r\nrecent epoch, those parts of France, of Germany, of Hungary, and of Italy,\r\nwhich afford evidences of volcanic action now extinct, were covered by the\r\nocean.

When I collect together all the facts that may be\r\nderived from my own observation and the laborious researches of others, it\r\nappears to me that every thing in this great quantity of aqueous vapors,\r\nwhich are unquestionably exhaled from volcanoes even when in a state of\r\nrest, be derived from sea water impregnated with salt, or rather, perhaps\r\nwith fresh meteoric water; or whether the expansive force of the vapors\r\n(which, at a depth of nearly 94,000 feet, is equal to 2800 atmospheres)\r\nwould be able at different depths to counterbalance the hydrostatic pressure\r\nof the sea, and thus afford them, under certain conditions, a free access to\r\nthe focus;* or whether the formation of metallic chlorids, the presence of\r\nchlorid of sodium in the fissures of the crater, and the frequent mixture of\r\nhydrochloric acid with the aqueous vapors, necessarily imply access of sea\r\nwater; or, finally, whether the repose of volcanoes (either when temporary,\r\nor permanent and complete) depends upon the closure of the channels by which\r\nthe sea or meteoric water was conveyed, or whether the absence of flames and\r\nof exhalations of hydrogen (and sulphureted hydrogen gas seems more\r\ncharacteristic of solfataras than of active volcanoes) is not directly at\r\nvariance\r\np 245\r\nwith the hypothesis of the decomposition of great masses of water?**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Compare Gay-Lussac, 'Sur les Volcans', in the 'Annales de\r\nChimie', t. xxii., p. 427, and Bischof, 'Warmelehre', s. 272.  The eruptions\r\nof smoke and steam which have at different periods been seen in Lancerote,\r\nIceland, and the Kurile Islands, during the eruption of the neighboring\r\nvolcanoes, afford indications of the reaction of volcanic foci through tense\r\ncolumns of water; that is to say, these phenomena occur when the expansive\r\nforce of the vapor exceeds the hydrostatic pressure.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** [See Daubeney 'On Volcanoes', Part iii., ch. xxxvi.,\r\nxxxviii., xxxix.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion of these important physical questions does not come within\r\nthe scope of a work of this nature; but, while we are considering these\r\nphenomena, we would enter somewhat more into the question of the\r\ngeographical distribution of still active volcanoes.  We find, for instance,\r\nthat in the New World, three, viz., Jorullo, Popocatepetl, and the volcano\r\nof De la Fragua, are situated at the respective distances of 80, 132, and\r\n196 miles from the sea-coast, while in Central Asia, as Abel Remusat* first\r\nmade known to geognosists, the Thianschan (Celestial Mountains), in which\r\nare situated the lava-emitting mountain of Pe-schan, the solfatara of\r\nUrumtsi, and the still active igneous mountain (Ho-tscheu) of Turfan, lie at\r\nan almost equal distance (1480 to 1528 miles) from the shores of the Polar\r\nSea and those of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Abel Remusat, 'Lettre a M. Cordier', in the 'Annales de\r\nChimie', t. v., p. 137.\r\n\r\n\r\nPe-schan is also fully 1360 miles distant from the Caspian Sea,* and 172 and\r\n218 miles from the seas of Issikul and Balkasch.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 30-33, 38-52, 70-80, and\r\n426-428.  The existence of active volcanoes in Kordofan, 540 miles from the\r\nRed Sea, has been recently contradicted by Ruppell, 'Reisen in Nubien',\r\n1829, s. 151.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of notice, that among the four great parallel mountain\r\nchains which traverse the Asiatic continent from east to west, the Altai,\r\nthe Thianschan, the Kuen-lun, and the Himalaya, it is not the latter chain,\r\nwhich is nearest to Kuen-lun, at the distance of 1600 and 720 miles from the\r\nsea, which have fire-emitting mountains like Aetna and Vesuvius, and\r\ngenerate ammonia like the volcano of Guatimala.  Chinese writers undoubtedly\r\nspeak of lava streams when they describe the emissions of smoke and flame,\r\nwhich, issuing from Pe-schan, devastated a space measuring ten li* in the\r\nfirst and seventh centuries of our era.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[A 'li' is a Chinese measurement, equal to about one thirtieth\r\nof a mile.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurning masses of stone flowed, according to their description \"like thin\r\nmelted fat.\"  The facts that have been enumerated, and to which sufficient\r\nattention has not been bestowed, render it probable that the vicinity of the\r\nsea, and the penetration of sea water to the foci of volcanoes, are not\r\nabsolutely necessary to the eruption of\r\np 246\r\nsubterranean fire, and that littoral situations only favor the eruption by\r\nforming the margin of a deep sea basin, which, covered by strata of water,\r\nand lying many thousand feet lower than the interior continent, can offer\r\nbut an inconsiderable degree of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe present active volcanoes, which communicate by permanent craters\r\nsimultaneously with the interior of the earth and with the atmosphere, must\r\nhave been formed at a subsequent period, when the upper chalk strta and all\r\nthe tertiary formations were already present:  this is shown to be the fact\r\nby the trachytic and basaltic eruptions which frequently form the walls of\r\nthe crater of elevation.  Melaphyres extend to the middle tertiary\r\nformations, but are found already in the Jura limestone, where they break\r\nthrough the variegated sandstone.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dufrenoy et Elie de Beaumont, 'Explication de la Carte\r\nGeologique de la France', t. i., p. 89.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not confound the earlier outpourings of granite, quartzose porphyry,\r\nand euphotide from temporary fissures in the old transition rocks with the\r\npresent active volcanic craters.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of volcanic activity is either only partial -- in which case\r\nthe subterranean fire seeks another passage of escape in the same mountain\r\nchain -- or it is total, as in Auvergne.  More recent examples are recorded\r\nin historical times, of the total extinction of the volcano of Mosychlos,*\r\non the island sacred to Hephaestos (Vulcan), whose \"high whirling flames\"\r\nwere known to Sophocles; and of the volcano of Medina, which according to\r\nBurckhardt, still continued to pour out a stream of lava on the 2d of\r\nNovember, 1276.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Sophocl., 'Philoct.', v. 971 and 972.

The chart of Lemmos,\r\nconstructed by Choiseul, makes it extremely probable that the extinct crater\r\nof Mosychlos, and the island of Chryse, the desert habitation of Philoctetes\r\n(Otfried Muller, 'Minyer', s. 300), have been long swallowed up by the sea.\r\nReefs and shoals, to the northeast of Lemnos, still indicate the spot where\r\nthe Aegean Sea once possessed an active volcano like Aetna, Vesuvius,\r\nStromboli, and Volcano (in the Lipari Isles).\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery stage of volcanic activity, from its first origin to its extinction,\r\nis characterized by peculiar products; first by ignited scoriae, streams of\r\nlava consisting of trachyte, pyroxene, and obsidian, and by rapilli and\r\ntufaceous ashes, accompanied by the development\r\np 247\r\nof large quantities of pure aqueous vapor; subsequently, when the volcano\r\nbecomes a solfatara, by aqueous vapors mixed with sulphureted hydrogen and\r\ncarbonic acid gases; and, finally, when it is completely cooled, by\r\nexhalations of carbonic acid alone.  There is a remarkable class of igneous\r\nmountains which do not eject lava, but merely devastating streams of hot\r\nwater,* impregnated with burning sulphur and rocks reduced to a state of\r\ndust (as, for instance, the Galungung in Java); but whether these mountains\r\npresent a normal condition, or only a certain transitory modification of the\r\nvolcanic process, must remain undecided until they are visited by geologists\r\npossessed of a knowledge of chemistry in its present condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Compare Reinwardt and Hoffmann, in Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd.\r\nxii., s. 607; Leop. von Buch, 'Descr. des Iles Canaries', p. 424-426.  The\r\neruptions of argillaceous mud at Carguairazo, when that volcano was\r\ndestroyed in 1698, the Lodazales of Igualata, and the Moya of Pelileo -- all\r\non the table-land of Quito -- are volcanic phenomena of a similar nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavored in the above remarks to furnish a general description of\r\nvolcanoes -- comprising one of the most important sections of the history of\r\nterrestrial activity -- and I have based my statements partly on my own\r\nobservations, but more in their general bearing on the results yielded by\r\nthe labors of my old friend, Leopold von Buch, the greatest geognosist of\r\nour own age, and the first who recognized the intimate connection of\r\nvolcanic phenomena, and their mutual dependence upon one another, considered\r\nwith reference to their relations in space.\r\n\r\nVolcanic action, or the reaction of the interior of a planet on its external\r\ncrust and surface, was long regarded only as an isolated phenomenon, and was\r\nconsidered solely with respect to the disturbing action of the subterranean\r\nforce; and it is only in recent times that -- greatly to the advantage of\r\ngeognostical views based on physical analogies -- volcanic forces have been\r\nregarded as 'forming new rocks, and transforming those that already\r\nexisted'.  We here arrive at the point to which I have already alluded, at\r\nwhich a well-grounded study of the activity of volcanoes, whether igneous or\r\nmerely such as emit gaseous exhalations, leads us, on the one hand, to the\r\nmineralogical branch of geognosy (the science of the texture and the\r\nsuccession of terrestrial strata), and, on the other, to the science of\r\ngeographical forms and outlines -- the configuration of continents and\r\ninsular groups elevated above the level\r\np 248\r\nof the sea.  This extended insight into the connection of natural phenomena\r\nis the result of the philosophical direction which has been so generally\r\nassumed by the more earnest study of geognosy.  Increased cultivation of\r\nscience and enlargement of political views alike tend to unite elements that\r\nhad long been divided.\r\n\r\nThis material taken from pages 248-\r\n\r\nCOSMOS: A Sketch of the Physical Description of the Universe, Vol. 1\r\nby Alexander von Humboldt\r\n\r\nTranslated by E C Otte\r\n\r\nfrom the 1858 Harper & Brothers edition of Cosmos, volume 1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\np 248\r\n\r\nIf, instead of classifying rocks according to their varieties of form and\r\nsuperposition into stratified and unstratified, schistose and compact,\r\nnormal and abnormal, we investigate those phenomena of formation and\r\ntransformation which are still going on before our eyes, we shall find that\r\nrocks admit of being arranged according to four modes of origin.\r\n\r\n'Rocks of eruption', which have issued from the interior of the earth either\r\nin a state of fusion from volcanic action, or in a more or less soft,\r\nviscous condition, from Plutonic action.\r\n\r\n'Sedimentary rocks', which have been precipitated and deposited on the\r\nearth's surface from a fluid, in which the most minute particles were either\r\ndissolved or held in suspension constituting the greater part of the\r\nsecondary (or flotz) and tertiary groups.\r\n\r\n'Transformed or metamorphic rocks',* in which the internal texture and the\r\nmode of stratification have been changed, either\r\np 249\r\nby contact or proximity with a Plutonic or volcanic endogenous rock of\r\neruption,** or, what is more frequently the case, by a gaseous sublimation\r\nof substances*** which accompany certain masses erupted in a hot, fluid\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *[As the doctrine of mineral metamorphism is now exciting very\r\ngeneral attention, we subjoin a few explanatory observations by the 'New\r\nPhilos. Journ.', Jan., 1848:  \"In its widest sense, mineral metamorphism\r\nmeans every change of aggregation, structure, or chemical condition which\r\nrocks have undergone subsequently to their deposition and stratification, or\r\nthe effects which have been produced by other forces than gravity and\r\ncohesion.  There fall under this definition, the discoloration of the\r\nsurface of black limestone by the loss of carbon; the formation of\r\nbrownish-red crusts on rocks of limestone, sandstone, many slate structures,\r\nserpentine, granite, etc., by the decomposition of iton pyrites, or magnetic\r\niron, finely disseminated in the mass of the rock; the conversion of\r\nanhydrite into gypsum, in consequence of the absorption of water; the\r\ncrumbling of many granites and porphyries into gravel, occasioned by the\r\ndecomposition of the mica and feldspar.  In its more limited sense, the term\r\nmetamorphic is confined to those changes of the rock which are produced, not\r\nby the effect of the atmosphere or of water on the exposed surfaces, but\r\nwhich are produced, directly or indirectly, by agencies seated in the\r\ninterior of the earth.  In many cases the mode of change may be explained by\r\nour physical or chemical theories, and may be viewed as the effect of\r\ntemperature or of electro-chemical actions.  Adjoining rocks, or connecting\r\ncommunications with the interior of the earth, also distinctly point out the\r\nseat from which the change proceeds. In many other cases the metamorphic\r\nprocess itself remains a mystery, and from the nature of the products alone\r\ndo we conclude that such a metamorphic action has taken place.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** In a plan of the neighborhood of Tezcuco, Totonilco, and\r\nMoran ('Atlas Geographique et Physique', pl. vii.), which I originally\r\n(1803) intended for a work which I never published, entitled 'Pasigrafia\r\nGeognostica destinada al uso de los Jovenes del Colegio de Mineria de\r\nMexico', I names (in 1832) the Plutonic and volcanic eruptive rocks\r\n'endogenous' (generated in the interior), and the sedimentary and flotz\r\nrocks 'exogenous' (or generated externally on the surface of the earth).\r\nPasiward, [upward arrow] and the latter by the same symbol directed downward\r\n[downward arrow].  These signs have at least some advantage over the\r\nascending lines, which in the older systems represent arbitrarily and\r\nungracefully the horizontally ranged sedimentary strata, and their\r\npenetration through masses of basalt, porphyry, and syenite.  The names\r\nproposed in the pasigraphico-geognostic plan were borrowed from De\r\nCandolle's nomenclature, in which 'endogenous' is synonymous with\r\nmonocotyledonous, and 'exogenous' with dicotyledonous plants.  Mohl's more\r\naccurate examination of vegetable tissues has, however, shown that the\r\ngrowth of monocotyledons from within, and dicotyledons from without, is not\r\nstrictly and generally true for vegetable organisms (Link, 'Elementa\r\nPhilosophiae Botanicae', t. i., 1837, p. 287; Endlicher and Unger,\r\n'Grundzugeder Botanik', 1843, s. 89; and Jussieu, 'Traite de Botanique', t.\r\ni., p. 85).  The rocks which I have termed endogenous are characteristically\r\ndistinguished by Lyell, in his 'Principles of Geology', 1833, vol. iii., p.\r\n374, as \"nether-formed\" or \"hypogene rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *** Compare Leop. von Buch, 'Ueber Dolomit als Gebirgsart', 1823,\r\ns. 36; and his remarks on the degree of fluidity to be ascribed to Plutonic\r\nrocks at the period of their eruption, as well as on the formation of gneiss\r\nfrom schist, through the action of granite and of the substances upheaved\r\nwith it, to be found in the 'Abhandl. der Akad. der Wissensch. zu Berlin'\r\nfor the year 1842, s. 58 und 63, and in the 'Jahrbuch fur Wissenschaftliche\r\nKritik', 1840, s. 195.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Conglomerates'; coarse or finely granular sandstones, or breccias composed\r\nof mechanically-divided masses of the three previous species.\r\n\r\nThese four modes of formation -- by the emission of volcanic masses, as\r\nnarrow lava streams; by the action of these masses on rocks previously\r\nhardened; by mechanical separation or chemical precipitation from liquids\r\nimpregnated with carbonic acid; and, finally, by the cementation of\r\ndisintegrated rocks of heterogeneous nature -- are phenomena and formative\r\nprocesses which must merely be regarded as a faint reflection of that more\r\nenergetic activity which must have characterized the chaotic condition of\r\nthe earlier world under wholly different conditions of pressure and at a\r\nhigher temperature, not only in the whole crust of the earth, but likewise\r\nin the more\r\np 250\r\nextended atmosphere, overloaded with vapors.  The vast fissures which were\r\nformerly open in the solid crust of the earth have since been filled up or\r\nclosed by the protrusion of elevated mountain chains, or by the penetration\r\nof veins of rocks of eruption (granite, porphyry, basalt, and melaphyre);\r\nand while, scarcely more than four volcanoes remaining through which fire\r\nand stones are erupted, the thinner, more fissured, and unstable crust of\r\nthe earth was anciently almost every where covered by channels of\r\ncommunication between the fused interior and the external atmosphere.\r\nGaseous emanations rising from very unequal depths, and therefore conveying\r\nsubstances differing in their chemical nature, imparted greater activity to\r\nthe Plutonic processes of formation and transformation.  The sedimentary\r\nformations, the deposits of liquid fluids from cold and hot springs, which\r\nwe daily see producing the travertine strata near Rome, and near Hobart Town\r\nin Van Diemen's Land, afford but a faint idea of the flotz formation.  In\r\nour seas, small banks of limestone, almost equal in hardness at some parts\r\nto Carrara marble,* are in the course of formation, by gradual\r\nprecipitation, accumulation, and cementation -- processes whose mode of\r\naction has not been sufficiently well investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  Darwin, 'Volcanic Islands', 1844, p. 49 and 154.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sicilian coast, the island of Ascension, and King George's Sound in\r\nAustralia, are instances of this mode of formation.  On the coasts of the\r\nAntilles, these formations of the present ocean contain articles of pottery,\r\nand other objects of human industry, and in Guadaloupe even human skeletons\r\nof the Carib tribes.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[In most instances the bones are dispersed; but a large slab of\r\nrock, in which considerable portion of the skeleton of a female is embedded,\r\nis preserved in the British Museum.  The presence of these bones has been\r\nexplained by the circumstance of a battle, and the massacre of a tribe of\r\nGallibis by the Caribs, which took place near the spot in which they are\r\nfound, about 120 years ago; for, as the bodies of the slain were interred on\r\nthe sea-shore, their skeletons may have been subsequently covered by\r\nsand-drift, which has since consolidated into limestone.  Dr. Moultrie, of\r\nthe Medical College, Charleston, South Carolina, U.S., is, however, of\r\nopinion that these bones did not belong to individuals of the Carib tribe,\r\nbut of the Peruvian race, or of a tribe possessing a similar craniological\r\ndevelopment.] --Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negroes of the French colonies designate these formations by the name of\r\n'Maconne-bon-Dieu'.*\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreau de Jonnes, 'Hist.

Rocks very\r\nsimilar to these consisting of the same elements, but grouped differently,\r\nare still formed by volcanic processes, as in the earlier periods of the\r\nworld.  The character of rocks, as we have already remarked is so\r\nindependent of geographical relations of space,* that the geologist\r\nrecognizes with surprise, alike to the north or the south of the equator, in\r\nthe remotest and most dissimilar zones, the familiar aspect, and the\r\nrepetition of even the most minute characteristics in the periodic\r\nstratification of the silurian strata, and in the effects of contact with\r\naugitic masses of eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, op. cit., p. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now enter more fully into the consideration of the four modes in\r\nwhich rocks are formed -- the four phases of their formative processes\r\nmanifested in the stratified and unstratified portions of the earth's\r\nsurface; thus, in the 'endogenous' or 'erupted rocks', designated by modern\r\ngeognosists as compact and abnormal rocks, we may enumerate the following\r\nprincipal groups as immediate products of terrestrial activity:\r\n\r\n1.  'Granite and syenite' of very different respective ages; the granite is\r\nfrequently the more recent,* traversing the syenite in veins, and being, in\r\nthat case, the active upheaving agent.  \"Where the granite occurs in large,\r\ninsulated masses of a faintly-arched, ellipsoidal form, it is covered by a\r\ncrust of shell cleft into blocks, instances of which are met with alike in\r\nthe Hartz district, in Mysore, and in Lower Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bernhard Cotta, 'Geognosie', 1839, s. 273.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis surface of the granite, owing to the great expansion that accompanied\r\nits first upheaval.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Ueber Granit and Gneiss', in the 'Abhandl. der\r\nBerl. Akad.' for the year 1842, s. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth in Northern Asia,* on the charming and romantic shores of the Lake of\r\nKolivan, on the northwest declivity of\r\np. 252\r\nthe Altai Mountains, and at Las Trincheras, on the slop of the littoral\r\nchain of Caraccas,** I have seen granite divided into ledges, owing probably\r\nto a similar contraction, although the divisions appeared to penetrate far\r\ninto the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote] *  In the projecting mural masses of granite of Lake Kolivan,\r\ndivided into narrow parallel beds, there are numerous crystals of feldspar\r\nand albite, and a few of titanium (Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 295,\r\nGustav Rose, 'Reise mach dem Ural', bd. i., s. 524).\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Relation Historique', t. ii., p. 99\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther to the south of Lake Kolivan, toward the boundaries of the Chinese\r\nprovince Ili (between Buchtarminsk and the River Narym), the formation of\r\nthe erupted rock, in which there is no gneiss, is more remarkable than I\r\never observed in any other part of the earth.  The granite, which is always\r\ncovered with scales and characterized by tabular divisions, rises in the\r\nsteppes, either in small hemispherical eminences, scarcely six or eight feet\r\nin height, or like basalt, in mounds, terminating on either side of their\r\nbases in narrow streams.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** See the sketch of Biri-tau, which I took from the south side,\r\nwhere the Kirghis tents stood, and which is given in Rose's 'Reise', bd. i.,\r\ns. 584.

In the valley of Irtysch, between Buchtarminsk and\r\nUstkamenogorsk, granite covers transition slate for a space of four miles,*\r\npenetrating into it from above in narrow, variously ramified, wedge-like\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 299-311, and the drawings\r\nin Rose's 'Reise', bd. i., s. 611, in which we see the curvature in the\r\nlayers of granite which Leop. von Buch has pointed out as chracteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have only instanced these peculiarities in order to designate the\r\nindividual character of one of the most generally diffused erupted-rocks.\r\nAs granite is superposed on slate in Siberia and in the Departement de\r\nFinisterre (Isle de Mihau), so it covers the Jura limestone in the mountains\r\nof Oisons (Fermonts), and syenite, and indirectly also chalk, in Saxony,\r\nnear Weinbohla.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *This remarkable superposition was first described by Weiss in\r\nKrsten's 'Archiv fur Bergbau und H¨ttenwesen', bd. xvi., 1827, s. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear Mursinsk, in the Uralian district, granite is of a drusous character,\r\nand here the pores, like the fissures and cavities of recent volcanic\r\nproducts, inclose many kinds of magnificent crystals, especially beryls and\r\ntopazes.\r\n\r\n2.  'Quartzose porphyry' is often found in the relation of veins to other\r\nrocks.  The base is generally a finely granular mixture of the same elements\r\nwhich occur in the larger imbedded\r\np 253\r\ncrystals.  In granitic porphyry that is very poor in quartz, the feldspathic\r\nbase is almost granular and laminated.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dufrenoy et Elie de Beaumont, 'Geologie de la France', t. i.,\r\np. 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  'Greenstones, Diorite', are granular mixtures of white albite and\r\nblackish-green hornblende, forming dioritic porphyry when the crystals are\r\ndeposited in a base of denser tissue.  The greenstones, either pure, or\r\ninclosing laminae of diallage (as in the Fichtelgebirge), and passing into\r\nserpentine, have sometimes penetrated, in the form of strata, into the old\r\nstratified fissures of green argillaceous slate, but they more frequently\r\ntraverse the rocks in veins, or appear as globular masses of greenstone,\r\nsimilar to domes of basalt and porphyry.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *These intercalated beds of diorite play an important part in\r\nthe mountain district of Nailau, near Steben, where I was engaged in mining\r\noperations in the last century, and with which the happiest associations of\r\nmy early life are connected.  Compare Hoffmann, in Poggendorf's 'Annalen',\r\nbd. xvi., s. 558.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Hypersthene rock' is a granular mixture of labradorite and hypersthene.\r\n\r\n'Euphotide' and serpentine, containing sometimes crystald of augite and\r\nuralite instead of diallage, are thus nearly allied to another more\r\nfrequent, and I might almost say, more 'energetic' eruptive rock -- augitic\r\nporphyry.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *In the southern and Bashkirian portion of the Ural.

Mesotype and nepheline constitute, according to Girard, an important\r\npart in the composition and internal texture of basalt.  The nepheline\r\ncontained in basalt reminds the geognosist both of the miascite of the Ilmen\r\nMountains in the Ural,* which has been confounded with granite, and\r\nsometimes contains zirconium, and of the pyroxenic nepheline discovered by\r\nGumprecht near Lobau and Chemnitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *G. Rose, 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. ii., s. 47-52.  Respecting\r\nthe identity of eleolite and uepheline (the latter containing rather the\r\nmore lime), see Scheerer, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xlix., s. 359-381.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the second or sedimentary rocks belong the greater part of the formations\r\nwhich have been comprised under the old\r\np 254\r\nsystematic, but not very correct designation of 'transition, flot' or\r\n'secondary', and 'tertiary formations'.  If the erupted rocks had not\r\nexercised an elevating, and, owing to the simultaneous shock of the earth, a\r\ndisturbing influence on these sedimentary formations, the surface of our\r\nplanet would have consisted of strata arranged in a uniformly horizontal\r\ndirection above one another.  Deprived of mountain chains, on whose\r\ndeclivities the gradations of vegetable forms and the scale of the\r\ndiminishing heat of the atmosphere appear to be picturesquely reflected --\r\nfurrowed ony here and there by valleys of erosion, formed by the force of\r\nfresh water moving on in gentle undulations, or by the accumulation of\r\ndetritus, resulting from the action of currents of water -- continents would\r\nhave presented no other appearance from pole to pole than the dreary\r\nuniformity of the llanos of South America or the steppes of Northern Asia.\r\nThe vault of heaven would everywhere have appeared to rest on vast plains,\r\nand the stars to rise as if they emerged from the depths of ocean.  Such a\r\ncondition of things could not, however, have generally prevailed for any\r\nlength of time in the earlier periods of the world, since subterranean\r\nforces must have striven in all epochs to exert a counteracting influence.\r\n\r\nSedimentary strta have been either precipitated or deposited from liquids,\r\naccording as the materials entering into their composition are supposed,\r\nwhether as limestone or argillaceous slate, to be either chemically\r\ndissolved or suspended and commingled.  But earth, when dissolved in fluids\r\nimpregnated with carbonic acid, must be regarded as undergoing a mechanical\r\nprocess while they are being precipitated, deposited, and accumulated into\r\nstrata.  This view is of some importance with respect to the envelopment of\r\norganic bodies in petrifying calcareous beds.  The most ancient sediments of\r\nthe transition and secondary formations have probably been formed from water\r\nat a more or less high temperature, and at a time when the heat of the upper\r\nsurface of the earth was still very considerable.  Considered in this point\r\nof view, a Plutonic action seems to a certain extent also to have taken\r\nplace in the sedimentary strata, especially the more ancient; but these\r\nstrata appear to have been hardened into a schistose structure, and under\r\ngreat pressure, and not to have been solidified by cooling, like the rocks\r\nthat have issued from the interior, as, for instance, granite, porphyry, and\r\nbasalt.  By degrees, as the waters lost their temperature, and were able to\r\nabsorb a copious supply of the carbonic acid gas with which\r\np 255\r\nthe atmosphere was overcharged, they became fitted to hold in solution a\r\nlarger quantity of lime.\r\n\r\n'The sedimentary strata', setting aside all other exogenous, purely\r\nmechanical deposits of sand or detritus, are as follows:\r\n\r\n'Schist', of the lower and upper transition rock, compositing the silurian\r\nand devonian formations; from the lower silurian strata, which were once\r\ntermed cambrian, to the upper strata of the old red sandstone or devonian\r\nformation, immediately in contact with the mountain limestone.\r\n\r\n'Carboniferous deposits':\r\n\r\n'Limestones' imbedded in the transition and carboniferous formations;\r\nzechstein, muschelkalk, Jura formation and chalk, also that portion of the\r\ntertiary formation which is not included in sandstone and conflomerate.\r\n\r\n'Travertine', fresh-water limestone, and silicious concretions of hot\r\nsprings, formations which have not been produced under the pressure of a\r\nlarge body of sea water, but almost in immediate contact with the\r\natmosphere, as in shallow marshes and streams.\r\n\r\n'Infusorial deposits':  geognostical phenomena, whose great importance in\r\nproving the influence of organic activity in the formation of the solid part\r\nof the earth's crust was first discovered at a recent period by my\r\nhighly-gifted friend and fellow-traveler, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\nIf, in this short and superficial view of the mineral constituents of the\r\nearth's crust, I do not place immediately after the simple sedimentary rocks\r\nthe conglomerates and sandstone formations which have also been deposited as\r\nsedimentary strata from liquids, and which have been imbedded alternately\r\nwith schist and limestone, it is only because they contain, together with\r\nthe detritus of eruptive and sedimentary rocks, also the detritus of gneiss,\r\nmica slate, and other metamorphic masses.  The obscure process of this\r\nmetamorphism, and the action if produces, must therefore compose the third\r\nclass of the fundamental forms of rock.\r\n\r\nEndogenous or erupted rocks (granite, porphyry, and melaphyre) produce, as I\r\nhave already frequently remarked, not only cynamical, shaking, upheaving\r\nactions, either vertically or laterally displacing the strata, but they also\r\noccasion changes in their chemical composition as well as in the nature of\r\ntheir internal structure; new rocks being thus formed, as gneiss, mica\r\nslate, and granular limestone (Carrara and Parian marble).  The old silurian\r\nor devonian transition schists, the belemnitic limestone of Tarantaise, and\r\nthe dull gray calcareous\r\np 256\r\nsandstone ('Macigno'), which contains alggae found in the northern\r\nApennines, often assume a new and more brilliant appearance after their\r\nmetamorphosis, which renders it difficult to recognize them.  The theory of\r\nmetamorphism was not established until the individual phases of the change\r\nwere followed step by step, and direct chemical experiments on the\r\ndifference in the fusion point, in the pressure and time of cooling, were\r\nbrought in aid of mere inductive conclusions.  Where the study of chemical\r\ncombinations is regulated by leading ideas,* it may be the means of throwing\r\na clear light on the wide field of geognosy, and over the vast laboratory of\r\nnature in which rocks are continually being formed and modified by the\r\nagency of subterranean forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the admirable researches of Mitscherlich, in the 'Abhandl.\r\nder Berl. Akad.' for the years 1822 and 1823, s. 25-41; and in Poggend.,\r\n'Annalen', bd. x., s. 137-152; bd. xi., s. 323-332; bd. sli., s. 213-216\r\n(Gustav Rose, 'Ueber Gildung des Kalkspaths und Aragonits', in Poggend.,\r\n'Annalen', bd. xli., s, 353-366; Haidinger, in the 'Transactions of the\r\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh', 1827, p. 148.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe philosopohical inquirer will escape the deception of apparent analogies,\r\nand the danger of being led astray by a narrow view of natural phenomena, if\r\nhe constantly bear in view the complicated conditions which may, by the\r\nintensity of their force, have modified the counteracting effect of those\r\nindividual substances whose nature is better known to us.  Simple bodies\r\nhave, no doubt, at all periods, obeyed the same laws of attraction, and,\r\nwherever apparent contradictions present themselves, I am confident that\r\nchemistry will in most cases be able to trace the cause to some\r\ncorresponding error in the experiment.\r\n\r\nObservations made with extreme accuracy over large tracts of land, show that\r\nerupted rocks have not been produced in an irregular and unsystematic\r\nmanner.  In parts of the globe most remote from one another, we often find\r\nthat granite, basalt, and diorite have exercised a regular and uniform\r\nmetamorphic action, even in the minutest details, on the strata of\r\nargillaceous slate, dense limestone, and the grains of quartz in sandstones.\r\n As the same endogenous rock manifests almost every where the same degree of\r\nactivity, so on the contrary, different rocks belonging to the same class,\r\nwhether to the endogenous or the  erupted, exhibit great differences in\r\ntheir character.  Intense heat has undoubtedly influenced all these\r\nphenomena, but the degree of fluidity (the more or less perfect mobility of\r\nthe particles -- their more viscous composition) has varied very\r\nconsiderably from the granite to the basalt, while at different geological\r\np 257\r\nperiods (or metamorphic phases of the earth's crust) other substances\r\ndissolved in vapors have issued from the interior of the earth\r\nsimultaneously with the eruption of granite, basalt, greenstone porphyry,\r\nand serpentine.  This seems a fitting place again to draw attention to the\r\nfact that, according to the admirable views of modern geognosy, the\r\nmetamorphism of rocks is not a mere phenomenon of contact, limited to the\r\neffect produced by the apposition of two rocks, since it comprehends all the\r\ngeneric phenomena that have accompanied the appearance of a particular\r\nerupted mass.  Even where there is no immediate contact, the proximity of\r\nsuch a mass gives rise to modifications of solidification, cohesion,\r\ngranulation, and crystallization.\r\n\r\nAll eruptive rocks penetrate, as ramifying veins either into the sedimentary\r\nstrata, or into other equally endogenous masses; but there is a special\r\nimportance to be attached to the difference manifested between 'Plutonic'\r\nrocks* (granite, porphyry, and serpentine) and those termed 'volcanic' in\r\nthe strict sense of the word (as trachyte, basalt, and lava).\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ([Lyell, 'Principales of Geology', vol. i.i., p. 353 and 359.]\r\n-- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks produced by the activity of our present volcanoes appear as\r\nband-like streams, but by the confluence of several of them they may form an\r\nextended basin.  Wherever it has been possible to trace basaltic eruptions,\r\nthey have generally been found to terminate in slender threads.  Examples of\r\nthese narrow openings may be found in three places in Germany:  in the\r\n'Pflaster-kaute', at Marksuhl, eight miles from Eisenach; in the blue\r\n'Kuppe', near Eschwege, on the banks of the Werra; and in the Druidical\r\nstone on the Hollert road (Siegen), where the basalt has broken through the\r\nvariegated sandstone and graywacke slate, and has spread itself into\r\ncup-like fungoid enlargements, which are either grouped together like rows\r\nof columns, or are sometimes stratified in thin laminae.  The case is\r\notherwise with granite, syenite, quartzose porphyry, serpentine, and the\r\nwhole series of unstratified compact rocks, to which, from a predilection\r\nfor a mythological nomenclature, the term Plutonic has been applied.  These,\r\nwith the exception of occasional veins, were probably not erupted in a state\r\nof fusion, but merely in a softened condition; not from narrow fissures, but\r\nfrom long and widely-extending gorges.  They have been protruded, but have\r\nnot flowed forth, and are found not in streams like lava, but in extended\r\nmasses.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The description here given of the relation of position under\r\nwhich granite occurs, expresses the general or leading character of the\r\nwhole formation.  But its aspect at some places leads to the belief that it\r\nwas occasionally more fluid at the period of its eruption.  The description\r\ngiven by Rose, in his 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. i., s. 599, of part of the\r\nNarym chain, near the frontiers of the Chinese territories, as well as the\r\nevidence afforded by trachyte, as described by Dufrenoy and Elie de\r\nBeaumont, in their 'Description Geologique de la France', t. i., p. 70.\r\nHaving already spoken in the text of the narrow apertures through which the\r\nbasalts have sometimes been effused, I will here notice the large fissures,\r\nwhich have acted as conducting passages for melaphyres, which must not be\r\nconfounded with basalts.  See Murchison's interesting account ('The Silurian\r\nSystem', p. 126) of a fissure 480 feet wide, through which melaphyre has\r\nbeen ejected, at the coal-mine at Cornbrook, Hoar Edge.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome groups of dolerite and trachyte indicate\r\np 258\r\na certain degree of basaltic fluidity; others, which have been expanded into\r\nvast craterless domes, appear to have been only in a softened condition at\r\nthe time of their elevation.  Other trachytes, like those of the Andes, in\r\nwhich I have frequently perceived a striking analogy with the greenstones\r\nand syenitic porphyries (which are argentiferous, and without quartz), are\r\ndeposited in the same manner as granite and quartzose porphyry.\r\n\r\nExperiments on the changes which the texture and chemical constitution of\r\nrocks experience from the action of heat, have shown that volcanic masses*\r\n(diorite, augitic porphyry, basalt, and the lava of AEtna) yield different\r\nproducts, according to the difference of the pressure under which they have\r\nbeen fused, and the length of time occupied during their cooling; thus,\r\nwhere the cooling was rapid, they form a black glass, having a homogeneous\r\nfracture, and where the cooling was slow, a stony mass of granular\r\ncrystalline structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Sir James Hall, in the 'Edin.

The same materials yield the most dissimilar\r\nproducts, a fact that is of the greatest importance in reference to the\r\nstudy of the nature of erupted rocks, and of the metamorphic action which\r\nthey occasion.  Carbonate of lime, when fused under great pressure, does not\r\nlose its carbonic acid, but becomes, when cooled, granular limestone; when\r\nthe crystallization has been effected by the dry method, saccharoidal\r\nmarble; while by the humid method, calcareous spar and aragonite and\r\nproduced, the former under a lesser degree of temperature than the latter.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Gustav Rose, in Poggend., 'Annalen.' bd. xliii., s 364.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferences of temperature\r\np 259\r\nlikewise modify the direction in which the different particles arrange\r\nthemselves in the act of crystallization, and also affect the form of the\r\ncrystal.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the dimorphism of sulphur, see Mitscherlich, 'Lehrbuch der\r\nChemie', 55-63.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven when a body is not in a fluid condition, the smallest particles may\r\nundergo certain relations in their various modes of arrangement, which are\r\nmanifested by the different action on light.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On gypsum as a uniaxal crystal, and on the sulphate of\r\nmagnesia, and the oxyds of zinc and nickel, see Mitscherlich, in Poggend.,\r\n'Annalen.' bd. xi., s. 328.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomena presented by devitrification, and by the formation of steel by\r\ncementation and casting -- the transition of the fibrous in the granular\r\ntissue of the iron, from the action of heat* and probably, also, by regular\r\nand long-continued concussions -- likewise throw a considerable degree of\r\nlight on the geological process of metamorphism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Coste, 'Versuche am Creusot uber das bruchig werden des\r\nStabeisens.'

Here the planes of stratification\r\nare intersected by another system of divisional stratification, almost at\r\nright angles with the former,* and thus indicating an action subsequent to\r\nthe alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * On the double system of divisional planes, see Elie de\r\nBeaumont, 'Geologie de la France', p. 41; Credner, 'Geognosie Thuringens und\r\ndes Harzes', s. 40; and Romer, 'Das Rheinische Uebergangsgebirge', 1844. s.\r\n5 und 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe penetration of silica causes the argillaceous schist to be traversed by\r\nquartz, transforming it, in part, into whetstone and silicious schist; the\r\nlatter sometimes containing carbon, and being then capable of producing\r\ngalvanic effects on the nerves.  The highest degree of silicifaction of\r\nschist is that observed in ribbon jasper, a material highly valuable in the\r\narts,* and which is produced in the Oural Mountains\r\np 260\r\nby the contact and eruption of augitic porphyry (at Orsk), of dioritic\r\nporphyry (at Aufschkul), or of a mass of hypersthenic rock conglomerated\r\ninto spherical masses (at Bogoslowsk).  At Monte Serrato, in the island of\r\nElba, according to Frederic Hoffman, and in Tuscany, according to Alexander\r\nBrongniart, it is formed by contact with euphotide and serpentine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The silica is not merely colored by peroxyd of iron, but is\r\naccompanied by clay, lime, and potash.

It is\r\nprobably to a similar contact that certain schists near Paimpol, in\r\nBrittany, with whose appearance I was much struck, while making a geological\r\npedestrian tour through that interesting country with Professor Kunth, owe\r\ntheir amygdaloid and cellular character, t. i., p. 234.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost geognosists adhere, with Leopold von Buch, to the well-known hypothesis\r\n\"that all the gneiss in the silurian strata of the transition formation,\r\nbetween the Icy Sea and the Gulf of Finland, has been produced by the\r\nmetamorphic action of granite.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Leopold von Buch, in the 'Abhandlungen der Akad. der\r\nWissenschaft zu Berlin, aus dem Jahr' 1842, s. 63, and in the 'Jahrbuchern\r\nfur Wissenschaftliche Kritik Jahrg.' 1840, s. 196.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Alps, at St. Gothard, calcareous marl is likewise changed from\r\ngranite into mica slate, and then transformed into gneiss.\"  Similar\r\nphenomena of the formation of gneiss and mica slate through granite present\r\nthemselves in the oolitic group of the Tarantaise,* in which belemnites are\r\np 261\r\nfound in rocks, which have some claim to be considered as mica slate, and in\r\nthe schistose group in the western part of the island of Elba, near the\r\npromontory of Calamita, and the Fichtelgebirge in Baireuth, between Loomitz\r\nand Markleiten.**\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Elie de Beaumont, in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles', t.\r\nxv., p. 362-372.  \"In approaching the primitive masses of Mont Rosa, and the\r\nmountains situated to the west of Coni, we perceive that the secondary\r\nstrata gradually lose the characters inherent in their mode of deposition.\r\nFrequently assuming a character apparently arising from a perfectly distinct\r\ncause, but not losing their stratification, they somewhat resemble in their\r\nphysical structure a brand of half-consumed wood, in which we can follow the\r\ntraces of the ligneous fibers beyond the spots which continue to present the\r\nnatural characters of wood.\"  (See, also, the 'Annales des Sciences\r\nNaturelles', t. xiv., p. 118-122, and von Dechen, 'Geognosie', s. 553.)\r\nAmong the most striking proofs of the transformation of rocks by Plutonic\r\naction, we must place the belemites in the schists of Nuffenen (in the\r\nAlpine valley of Eginen and in the Gries-glaciers), and the belemnites found\r\nby M. Charpentier in the so-called primitive limestone on the western\r\ndescent of the Col de la Seigne, between the Enclove de Monjovet and the\r\n'chalet' of La Lanchette, and which he showed to me at Bex in the autumn of\r\n1822 ('Annales de Chimie', t. xxiii., p. 262).\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** Hoffmann, in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xvi., s. 552, \"Strate\r\nof transition argillaceous schist in the Fichtelgebirge, which can be traced\r\nfor a length of 16 miles, are transformed into gneiss only at the two\r\nextremities, where they come in contact with granite.  We can there follow\r\nthe gradual formation of the gneiss, and the development of the mica and of\r\nthe feldspathic amygdaloids, in the interior of the argillaceous schist,\r\nwhich indeed contains in itself almost all the elements of these substances.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJasper, which,* as I have already remarked, is a production formed by the\r\nvolcanic action of augitic porphyry, could only be obtained in small\r\nquantities by the ancients, while another material, very generally and\r\nefficiently used by them in the arts, was granular or saccharoidal marble,\r\nwhich is likewise to be regarded solely as a sedimentary stratum altered by\r\nterrestrial heat and by proximity with erupted rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  * Among the works of art which have come down to us from the\r\nancient Greeks and Romans, we observe that none of any size -- as columns or\r\nlarge vases -- are formed from jasper; and even at the present day, this\r\nsubstance, in large masses, is only obtained from the Ural Mountains.  The\r\nmaterial worked as jasper from the Rhubarb Mountain (Raveniaga Sopka), in\r\nAltai, is a beautiful ribboned porphyry.  The word 'jasper' is derived from\r\nthe Semitic languages; and from the confused description of Theophrastus\r\n('De Lapidibus', 23 and 27) and Pliny (xxxvii., 8 and 9), who rank jasper\r\namong the \"opaque gems,\" the name appears to have been given to fragments of\r\n'jaspachat', and to a substance which the ancients termed 'jasponyx', which\r\nwe now know as 'opal-jasper'.  Pliny considers a piece of jasper eleven\r\ninches in length so rare as to require his mentioning that he had actually\r\nseen such a specimen:  \"Magnitudinem jaspidis undecim unciarum vidimus,\r\nformatamque inde effigem Neronis thoracatam.\"  According to Theophrastus,\r\nthe stone which he calls emerald, and from which large obelists were cut,\r\nmust have been an imperfect jasper.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis opinion is corroborated by the accurate observations on the phenomena\r\nof contact, by the remarkable experiments on fusion\r\np 262\r\nmade by Sir James Hall more than half a century ago, and by the attentive\r\nstudy of granitic veins, which has contributed so largely to the\r\nestablishment of modern geognosy.  Sometimes the erupted rock has not\r\ntransformed the compact into granular limestone to any great depth from the\r\npoint of contact.  Thus, for instance, we meet with a slight transformation\r\n-- a penumbra -- as at Belfast, in Ireland, where the basaltic veins\r\ntraverse the chalk, and, as in the compact calcareous beds, which have been\r\npartially inflected by the contact of syenitic granite, at the Bridge of\r\nBoscampo and the Cascade of Conzocoli, in the Tyrol (rendered celebrated by\r\nthe mention made of it by Count Mazari Peucati).*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote[  *Humboldt, 'Lettre a M.

Briefe\r\nuber das sudliche Tyrol', s. 101, 105, und 273.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother mode of transformation occurs where all the strata of the compact\r\nlimestone have been changed into granular limestone by the action of\r\ngranite, and syenitic or dioritic porphyry.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the transformation of compact into granular limestone by the\r\naction of granite, in the Pyrenees at the 'Montagnes de Rancie', see\r\nDufrenoy, in the 'Memoires Geologiques', t. ii., p. 440; and on similar\r\nchanges in the 'Montagnes de l'Oisans', see Elie de Beaumont, in the 'Mem.\r\nGeolog.', t. ii., p. 379-415; on a similar effect produced by the  action of\r\ndioritic and pyroxenic porphyry (the 'ophite' described by Elie de Beaumont,\r\nin the 'Geologie de la France', t. i., p. 72), between Tolosa and St.\r\nSebastian, see Dufrenoy, in the 'Mem. Geolog.', t. ii., p. 130; and by\r\nsyenite in the Isle of Skye, where the fossils in the altered limestone may\r\nstill be distinguished, see Von Dechen, in his 'Geognosie', p. 573.  In the\r\ntransformation of chalk by contact with basalt, the transposition of the\r\nmost minute particles in the processes of crystallization and granulation is\r\nthe more remarkable, because the excellent microscopic investigations of\r\nEhrenberg have shown that the particles of chalk previously existed in the\r\nform of closed rings.  See Poggend., 'Annalen der Physic', bd. xxxix., s.\r\n105; and on the rings of aragonite deposited from solution, see Gustav Rose\r\nin vol. xlii., p. 354, of the same journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would here wish to make special mention of Parian and Carrara marbles,\r\nwhich have acquired such celebrity from the noble works of art into which\r\nthey have been converted, and which have too long been considered in our\r\ngeognostic collections as the main types of primitive limestone.  The action\r\nof granite has been manifested sometimes by immediate contact, as in the\r\nPyrenees,* and sometimes, as in the main land of Greece, and in the insular\r\ngroups in the gean Sea, through the intermediate layers of gneiss or mica\r\nslate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Beds of granular limestone in the granite at Port d'Oo and in\r\nthe Mont de Labourd.  See Charpentier, 'Constitution Geologique des\r\nPyrenes', p. 144, 146.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth cases presuppose a simultaneous but heterogeneous process of\r\ntransformation.\r\np 263\r\nIn Attica, in the island of Euboea, and in the Peloponnesus, it has been\r\nremarked, \"that the limestone, when superposed on mica slate, is beautiful\r\nand crystalline in proportion to the purity of the latter substance and to\r\nthe smallness of its argillaceous contents; and, as is well known, this\r\nrock, together with beds of gneiss, appears at many points, at a\r\nconsiderable depth below the surface, in the islands of Paros and\r\nAntiparos.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Descr. des Canaries', p. 394; Fiedler, 'Reise\r\ndurch das Konigreich Griechenland', th. ii., s., 181, 190, und 516.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may here infer the existence of an imperfectly metamorphosed flotz\r\nformation, if faith can be yielded to the testimony of Origen, according to\r\nwhom, the ancient Eleatic, Xenophanes of Colophon* (who supposed the whole\r\nearth's crust to have been once covered by the sea), declared that marine\r\nfossils had been found in the quarries of Syracuse, and the impression of a\r\nfish (a sardine) in the deepest rocks of Paros.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *I have previously alluded to the remarkable passage in Origen's\r\n'Philosophumena', cap. 14 ('Opera', ed. Delarue, t. i., p. 893).  From the\r\nwhole context, it seems very improbable that Xenophanes meant an impression\r\nof a laurel ([Greek words]) instead of an impression of a fish ([Greek\r\nwords]).  Delarue is wrong in blaming the correction of Jacob Gronovius in\r\nchanging the laurel into a sardel.  The petrifaction of a fish is also much\r\nmore probable than the natural picture of Silenus, which, according to Pliny\r\n(lib. xxxvi., 5), the quarry-men are stated to have met with in Parian\r\nmarble from Mount Marpessos.  'Servius ad Virg., AEn.', vi., 471.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carrara or Luna marble quarries, which constituted the principal source\r\nfrom which statuary marble was derived even prior to the time of Augustus,\r\nand which will probably continue to do so until the quarries of Paros shall\r\nbe reopened, are beds of calcareous sandstone -- macigno -- altered by\r\nPlutonic action, and occurring in the insulated mountain of Apuana, between\r\ngneiss-like mica and talcose schist.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the geognostic relations of Carrara ('The City of the Moon',\r\nStrabo, lib. v., p. 222), see Savi 'Osservazioni sui terreni antichi\r\nToscani', in the 'Nuova Giornale de' Letterati di Pisa', and Hoffmann, in\r\nKarsten's 'Archiv fur Mineralogie', bd. vi., s. 258-263, as well as in his\r\n'Geogn. Reise durch Italien', s. 244-265.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether at some points granular limestone may not have been formed in the\r\ninterior of the earth, and been raised by gneiss and syenite to the surface,\r\nwhere it forms vein-like fissures,* is a question on which I can not hazard\r\nan opinion, owing to my own want of personal knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *According to the assumption of an excellent and very\r\nexperienced observer, Karl von Leonhard.  See his 'Jahrbuch fur\r\nMineralogie', 1834 s. 329, and Bernhard Cotta, 'Geognosie', s. 310.\r\n\r\n\r\np 264\r\nAccording to the admirable observations of Leopold von Buch, the masses of\r\ndolomite found in Southern Tyrol, and on the Italian side of the Alps,\r\npresent the most remarkable instance of metamorphism produced by massive\r\neruptive rocks on compact calcareous beds.  The formation of the limestone\r\nseems to have proceeded from the fissures which traverse it in all\r\ndirections.  The cavities are every where covered with rhomboidal crystals\r\nof magnesian bitter spar, and the whole formation, without any trace of\r\nstrtification, or of the fossil remains which it once contained, consists\r\nonly of a granular aggregation of crystals of dolomite.  Talc laminae lie\r\nscattered here and there in the newly-formed rock, traversed by masses of\r\nserpentine.  In the valley of the Fassa, dolomite rises perpendicularly in\r\nsmooth walls of dazzling whiteness to a height of many thousand feet.  It\r\nforms sharply-pointed conical mountains, clustered together in large\r\nnumbers, but yet not in contact with each other.  The contour of their forms\r\nrecalls to mind the beautiful landscape with which the rich imagination of\r\nLeonardi da Vinci has embellished the back-ground of the portrait of Mona\r\nLisa.\r\n\r\nThe geognostic phenomena which we are now describing, and which excite the\r\nimagination as well as the powers of the intellect, are the result of the\r\naction of augite porphyry manifested in its elevating, destroying, and\r\ntransforming force.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Geognostische Briefe an Alex. von Humboldt',\r\n1824, s. 86 and 82; also in the 'Annalen de Chemie', t. xxiii., p. 276, and\r\nin the 'Abhandl. der Berliner Akad. aus der Jahren 1822 'und' 1823, s.\r\n83-136; Von Dechen, 'Geognosie.' s. 574-576.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process by which limestone is converted into dolomite is not regarded by\r\nthe illustrious investigator who first drew attention to the phenomenon as\r\nthe consequence of the tale being derived from the black porphyry, but\r\nrather as a transformatiion simultaneous with the appearance of this erupted\r\nstone through wide fissures filled with vapors.  It remains for future\r\ninquirers to determine how transformation can have been effected without\r\ncontact with the endogenous stone, where strata of dolomite are found to be\r\ninterspersed in imestone.  Where, in this case, are we to seek the concealed\r\nchannels by which the Plutonic action is conveyed?  Even here it may not,\r\nhowever, be necessary, in conformity with the old Roman adage, to believe\r\n\"that much that is alike in nature may have been formed in wholly different\r\nways.\"  When we find, over widely extended parts of the earth, that two\r\nphenomena are always associated together, as, for instance, the occurrence\r\nof melaphyre\r\np 265\r\nand the transformation of compact limestone into a crystaline mass differing\r\nin its chemical character, we are, to a certain degree, justified in\r\nbelieving, where the second phenomenon is manifested unattended by the\r\nappearance of the first, that this apparent contradiction is owing to the\r\nabsence, in certain cases, of some of the conditions attendant upon the\r\nexciting causes.  Who would call in question the volcanic nature and igneous\r\nfluidity of basalt merely because there are some rare instances in which\r\nbasaltic veins, traversing beds of coal or strata of sandstone and chalk,\r\nhave not materially deprived the coal of its carbon, nor broken and slacked\r\nthe sandstone, not converted the chalk into granular marble?  Wherever we\r\nhave obtained even a faint light to guide us in the obscure domain of\r\nmineral formation, we ought not ungratefully to disregard it, because there\r\nmay be much that is still unexplained in the history of the relations of the\r\ntransitions, or in the isolated interposition of beds of unaltered strata.\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken of the alteration of compact carbonate of lime into\r\ngranular limestone and dolomite, it still remains for us to mention a third\r\nmode of transformation of the same mineral, which is ascribed to the\r\nemission, in the ancient periods of the world, of the vapors of sulphuric\r\nacid.  This transformation of limestone into gypsum is analogous to the\r\npenetration of rock salt and sulphur, the latter being deposited from\r\nsulphureted aqueous vapor.  In the lofty Cordilleras of Quindin, far from\r\nall volcanoes, I have observed deposits of sulphur in fissures in gneiss,\r\nwhile in Sicily (at Cattolica, near Girgenti), sulphur, gypsum, and rock\r\nsalt belong to the most recent secondary strata, the chalk formations.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Horrman, 'Geogn. Reise', edited by Von Dechen, s. 113-119, and\r\n380-386; Poggend., 'Annalen der Physik', bd. xxvi., s. 41.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also seen on the edge of the crater of Vesuvius, fissures filled with\r\nrock salt, which occurred in such considerable masses as occasionally to\r\nlead to its being disposed of by contraband trade.  On both declivities of\r\nthe Pyrenees, the connection of diorite and pyroxene, and colomite, gypsum,\r\nand rock salt, can not be questioned;* and here, as in the other phenomena\r\nwhich we have been considering, every thing bears evidence of the action of\r\nsubterranean forces on the sedimentary strata of the ancient sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dufrenoy, in the 'Memoires Geologiques', t. ii., p. 145 and 179.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is much difficulty in explaining the origin of the beds of pure\r\nquartz, which occur in such large quantities in South America, and impart so\r\npeculiar a character to the chain of\r\np 266\r\nthe Andes.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Essai Geogn. sur le Gisement des Roches', p. 93;\r\n'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 532.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn descending toward the South Sea, from Caxamarca toward Guangamarca, I\r\nhave observed vast masses of quartz, from 7000 to 8000 feet in height,\r\nsuperposed sometimes on porphyry devoid of quartz, and sometimes on diorite.\r\n Can these beds have been transformed from sandstone, as Elie de Beaumont\r\nconjectures in the case of the quartz strata on the Col de la Poissonniere,\r\neast of Briançon?*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Elie de Beaumont, in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles', t.\r\nxv., p. 362; Murchison, 'Silurian System', p. 286.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Brazils, in the diamond district of Minas Geraes and St. Paul, which\r\nhas recently been so accurately investigated by Clausen, Plutonic action has\r\ndeveloped in dioritic veins sometimes ordinary mica, and sometimes specular\r\niron in quartzose itacolumite.  The diamonds of Grammagoa are imbedded in\r\nstrata of solid silica, and are occasionally enveloped in laminae of mica,\r\nlike the garnets found in mica slate.  The diamonds that occur furthest to\r\nthe north, as those discovered in 1829 at 58 degrees lat., on the European\r\nslope of the Uralian Mountains, bear a geognostic relation to the black\r\ncarboniferous dolomite of Adolffskoi* and to augitic porphyry, although more\r\naccurate observations are required in order fully to elucidate this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Rose, 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. i., s. 364 und 367.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable phenomena of contact, we must, finally, enumerate\r\nthe formation of garnets in argillaceous schist in contact with basalt and\r\ndolerite (as in Northumberland and the island of Anglesea), and the\r\noccurrence of a vast number of beautiful and most various crystals, as\r\ngarnets, vesuvian, augite, and ceylanite, on the surfaces of contact between\r\nthe erupted and sedimentary rock, as, for instance, on the junction of the\r\nsyenite of Monzon with dolomite and compact limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. von Buch, 'Briefe', s. 109-129.  See also, Elie de\r\nBeaumont 'On the Contact of Granite with the Beds of the Jura', in the 'Mem.\r\nGeol.' t. ii., p. 408.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the island of Elba, masses of serpentine, which perhaps nowhere more\r\nclearly indicate the character of erupted rocks, have occasioned the\r\nsublimation of iron glance and red oxyd of iron in fissures of calcareous\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Hoffman, 'Reise', s. 30 und 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe still daily find the same iron glance formed by sublimation from the\r\nvapors and the walls of the fissures of open veins on the margin of the\r\ncrater, and in the fresh lava currents of the volcanoes of Stromboli,\r\nVesuvius, and AEtna.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the chemical process in the formation of specular iron, see\r\nGay Lussac, in the 'Annales de Chimie', t. xxii., p. 415, and Mitscherlich,\r\nin Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xv., s. 630.  Moreover, crystals of olivine have\r\nbeen formed (probaby by sublimation) in the cavities of the obsidian of\r\nCerro del Jacal, which I brought from Mexico (Gustav Rose, in Poggend.,\r\n'Annalen', bd. x., s. 323).  Hence olivine occurs in basalt, lava, obsidian,\r\nartificial scoriae in meteoric stones, in the syenite of Elfdale, and (as\r\nhyalosiderite) in the wacke of the Kaiserstuhl.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe veins that\r\np 267\r\nare thus formed beneath our eyes by volcanic forces, where the contiguous\r\nrock has already attained a certain degree of solidification, show us how,\r\nin a similar manner, mineral and metallic veins may have been every where\r\nformed in the more ancient periods of the world, where the solid but thinner\r\ncrust of our planet, shaken by earthquakes, and rent and fissured by the\r\nchange of volume to which it was subjected in cooling, may have presented\r\nmany communications with the interior, and many passages for the escape of\r\nvapors impregnated with earthy and metallic substances.  The arrangement of\r\nthe particles in layers parallel with the margins of the beins, the regular\r\nrecurrence of analogous layers on the opposite sides of the veins (on their\r\ndifferent walls), and, finally, the elongated cellular cavities in the\r\nmiddle, frequently afford direct evidence of the Plutonic process of\r\nsublimation in metalliferous veins.  As the traversing rocks must be of more\r\nrecent origin than the traversed, we learn from the relations of\r\nstratification existing between the porphyry and the argentiferous ores in\r\nthe Saxon mines (the richest and most important in Germany), that these\r\nformations are at any rate more recent than the vegetable remains found in\r\ncarboniferous strata and in the red sandstone.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Constantin von Veust, 'Ueber die Porphyrgebilde', 1835, s.\r\n89-96; also his 'Belenchtung der Werner'schen Gangtheorie', 1840, s. 6; and\r\nC. von Wissenbach, 'Abbildungen merkwurdiger Gangverhaltnisse', 1836, fig.\r\n12.  The ribbon-like structure of the veins is, however, no more to be\r\nregarded of general occurrence than the periodic order of the different\r\nmembers of these masses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the facts connected with our geological hypotheses on the formation of\r\nthe earth's crust and the metamorphism of rocks have been unexpectedly\r\nelucidated by the ingenious idea which led to a comparison of the slags or\r\nscoriae of our smelting furnaces with natural minerals, and to the attempt\r\nof reproducing the latter from their elements.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Mitscherlich, 'Ueber die kunstliche Darstellung der\r\nMineralien', in the 'Abhandl. der Akademie der Wiss. zu Berlin', 1822-3, s.\r\n25-41.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all these operations, the same affinities manifest themselves which\r\ndetermine chemical combinations both in our laboratories and in the interior\r\nof the earth.  The most considerable part of\r\np 268\r\nthe simple minerals which characterize the more generally diffused Plutonic\r\nand erupted rocks, as well as those on which they have exercised a\r\nmetamorphic action, have been produced in a crystalline state, and with\r\nperfect identify, in artificial mineral products.  We must, however,\r\ndistinguish here between the scoriae accidentally formed, and those which\r\nhave been designedly produced by chemists.  To the former belong feldspar,\r\nmica, augite, olivine, hornblende, crystallized oxyd of iron, magnetic iron\r\nin octahedral crystals, and metallis titanium;* to the latter, garnets,\r\nidocrase, rubies (equal in hardness to those found in the East), olivine,\r\nand augite.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *In scoriae crystals of feldspar have been discovered by Heine\r\nin the refuse of a furnace for copper fusing, near Sangerhausen, and\r\nanalyzed by Kersten (Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxiii., s. 337); crystals of\r\naugite in scoriae at Sahle (Mitscherlich, in the 'Abhandl. der Akad. zu\r\nBerlin', 1822-23, s. 40); of oliving by Seifstrom (Leonhard,\r\n'Basalt-Gebilde', bd. ii., s. 495); of mica in old scoriae of Schloss\r\nGarpenberg (Mitscherlich, in Leonhard, op. cit., s. 506); of magnetic iron\r\nin the scoriae of Chatillon sur Seine (Leonhard, s. 441); and of micaceous\r\niron in potter's clay (Mitscherlich, in Leohnard, op. cit., s. 234).\r\n[See Ebelmer's papers in 'Ann. de Chimie et de Physique', 1847; also 'Report\r\non the Crystalline Slags', by John Percy, M.D., F.R.S., and William Hallows\r\nMiller, M.A., 1847.  Dr. Percy, in a communication with which he has kindly\r\nfavored me, says that the minerals which he has found artificially produced\r\nand proved by analysis are Humboldtilite, gehlenite, olivine, and magnetic\r\noxyd of iron, in octahedral crystals.  He suggests that the circumstance of\r\nthe production of gehlenite at a high temperature in an iron furnace may\r\npossibly be made available by geologists in explaining the formation of the\r\nrocks in which the natural mineral occurs, as in Fassathal in the Tyrol.] --\r\nTr.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **Of minerals purposely produced, we may mention idocrase and\r\ngarnet (Mitscherlich, in Poggend., 'Annalen der Physik', bd. xxxii., s.\r\n340); ruby (Gaudin, in the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Academie de Science', t.\r\niv., Part i., p. 999); olivine and augite (Mitscherlich and Berthier, in the\r\n'Annales de Chimie et de Physique', t. xxiv., p. 376).  Notwithstanding the\r\ngreatest possible similarity in crystalline form, and perfect identity in\r\nchemical composition, existing, according to Gustav Rose, between augite and\r\nhornblende, hornblende has never been found accompanying augite in scoriae,\r\nnor have chemists ever succeeded in artificially producing either hornblende\r\nor feldspar (Mitscherlich in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. xxxiii., s. 340, and\r\nRose, 'Reise nach dem Ural', bd. ii., s. 358 und 363).

The artificial production\r\nof feldspar and mica is of most especial geognostic importance with\r\nreference to the theory of the formation of gneiss by the metamorphic agency\r\nof argillaceous schist, which contains all the constituents of granite,\r\np 269\r\npotash not excepted.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *D'Aubuisson, in the 'Journal de Physique', t. lxviii., p. 128.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would not be very surprising, therefore, as is well observed by the\r\ndistinguished geognosist, Von Dechen, if we were to meet with a fragment of\r\ngneiss formed on the walls of a smelting furnace which was built of\r\nargillaceous slate and graywacke.\r\n\r\nAfter  having taken this general view of the three classes of erupted,\r\nsedimentary, and metamorphic rocks of the earth's crust, it still remains\r\nfor us to consider the fourth class, comprising 'conglomerates', or 'rocks\r\nof detrius'.  The very term recalls the destruction which the earth's crust\r\nhas suffered, and likewise, perhaps reminds us of the process of\r\ncementation, which has connected together, by means of oxyd of iron, or of\r\nsome argillaceous and calcareous substances, the sometimes rounded and\r\nsometimes angular portions of fragments.  Conglomerates and rocks of\r\ndetritus, when considered in the widest sense of the term, manifest\r\ncharacters of a double origin.  The substances which enter into their\r\nmechanical composition have not been alone accumulated by the action of the\r\nwaves of the sea or currents of fresh water, for there are some of these\r\nrocks the formation of which can not be attributed to the action of water.\r\n\"When basaltic islands and trachytic rocks rise on fissures, friction of the\r\nelevated rock against the walls of the fissures causes the elevated rock to\r\nbe inclosed by conglomerates composed of its own matter.  The granules\r\ncomposing the sandstones of many formations have been separated rather by\r\nfriction against the erupted volcanic or Plutonic rock than destroyed by the\r\nerosive force of a neighboring sea.  The existence of these friction\r\n'conglomerates', which are met with in enormous masses in both hemispheres,\r\ntestifies the intensity of the force with which the erupted rocks have been\r\npropelled from the interior through the earth's crust.  This detritus has\r\nsubsequently been taken up by the waters, which have then deposited it in\r\nthe strata which it still covers.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leop. von Buck, 'Geognost. Briefe', s. 75-82, where it is also\r\nshown why the new red sandstone (the 'Todtliegende' of the Thuringian flotz\r\nformation) and the coal measures must be regarded as produced by erupted\r\nporphyry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSandstone formations are found imbedded in all strata, from the lower\r\nsilurian transition stone to the beds of the tertiary formations, superposed\r\non the chalk. They are found on the margin of the boundless plains of the\r\nNew Continent, both within and without the tropics, extending like\r\nbreast-works along the ancient shore, against which the sea once broke its\r\nfoaming waves.\r\n\r\np 270\r\nIf we cast a glance on the geographical distribution of rocks, and their\r\nrelations in space, in that portion of the earth's crust which is accessible\r\nto us, we shall find that the most universally distributed chemical\r\nsubstance is 'silicic acid', generally in a variously-colored and opaque\r\nform.  Next to solid silicic acid we must reckon carbonate of lime, and then\r\nthe combinations of silicic acid with alumina, potash, and soda, with lime,\r\nmagnesia, and oxyd of iron.\r\n\r\nThe substances which we designate as 'rocks' are determinate associations of\r\na small number of minerals, in which some combine parasitically, as it were,\r\nwith others, but only under definite relations; thus, for instance, although\r\nquartz (silica), feldspar, and mica are the principal constituents of\r\ngranite, these minerals also occur, either individually or collectively, in\r\nmany other formations.  By way of illustrating how the quantitative\r\nrelations of one feldspathic rock differ from another, richer in mica than\r\nthe former, I would mention that, according to Mitscherlich, three times\r\nmore alumina and one third more silica than that ossessed by feldspar, give\r\nthe constituents that enter into the composition of mica.  Potash is\r\ncontained in both -- a substance whose existence in many kinds of rocks is\r\nprobably antecedent to the dawn of vegetation on the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThe order of succession, and the relative age of the different formations,\r\nmay be recognized by the superposition of the sedimentary, metamorphic, and\r\nconglomerate strata; by the nature of the formations traversed by the\r\nerupted masses, and -- with the greatest certainty -- by the presence of\r\norganic remains and the differences of their structure.  The application of\r\nbotanical and zoological evidence to determine the relative age of rocks --\r\nthis chronometry of the earth's surface, which was already present to the\r\nlofty mind of Hooke -- indicates one of the most glorious epochs of modern\r\ngeognosy, which has finally, on the Continent at least, been emancipated\r\nfrom the sway of Semitic doctrines.  Palaeontological investigations have\r\nimparted a vivifying breath of grace and diversity to the science of the\r\nsolid structure of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe fossiliferous strata contain, entombed within them, the floras and\r\nfaunas of by-gone ages.  We ascend the stream of time, as in our study of\r\nthe relations of superposition we descend deeper and deeper through the\r\ndifferent strata, in which lies revealed before us a past world of animal\r\nand vegetable life.  Far-extending disturbances, the elevation of great\r\nmountain chains, whose relative ages we are able to define, attest the\r\np 271\r\ndestruction of ancient and the manifestation of recent organisms.  A few of\r\nthese older structures have remained in the midst of more recent species.\r\nOwing to the limited nature of our knowledge of existence, and from the\r\nfigurative terms by which we seek to hide our ignorance, we apply the\r\nappellation 'recent structure' to the historical henomena of transition\r\nmanifested in the organisms as well as in the forms of primitive seas and of\r\nelevated lands.  In some cases these organized structures have been\r\npreserved perfect in the minutest details of tissues, integument, and\r\narticulated parts, while in others, the animal, passing over soft\r\nargillaceous mud, has left nothing but the traces of its course,* or the\r\nremains of its undigested food, as in the coprolites.**\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[In certain localities of the new red sandstone, in the Valley\r\nof the Connecticut, numerous tridactyl markings have been occasionally\r\nobserved on the surface of the slabs of stone when split asunder, in like\r\nmanner as the ripple-marks appear on the successive layers of sandstone in\r\nTilgate Forest.  Some remarkably distinct impressions of this kind, at\r\nTurner's Falls (Massachusetts), happening to attract the attention of Dr.\r\nJames Deane, of Greenfield, that sagacious observer was struck with their\r\nresemblance to the foot-marks left on the mud-banks of the adjacent river by\r\nthe aquatic birds which had recenty frequented the spot.  The specimens\r\ncollected were submitted to Professor G. Hitchcock, who followed up the\r\ninquiry with a zeal and success that have led to the most interesting\r\nresults.  No reasonable doubt now exists that the imprints in question have\r\nbeen produced by the tracks of bipeds impressed on the stone when in a soft\r\nstate.  The announcement of this extraordinary phenomenon was first made by\r\nProfessor Hitchcock, in the 'American Journal of Science' (January, 1836),\r\nand that eminent geologist has since published full descriptions of the\r\ndifferent species of imprints which he has detected, in his splendid work on\r\nthe geology of Massachusetts. -- Mantell's 'Medals of Creation', vol. ii.,\r\np. 310.

The second is more specially geognostic, considering fossil remains\r\nin their relations to the superposition and relative age of the sedimentary\r\nformations.  The former has long predominated over the latter, and an\r\nimperfect and superficial comparison of fossil remains with existing species\r\nhas led to errors, which may still be traced in the extraordinary names\r\napplied to certain natural bodies.  It was sought to identify all fossil\r\nspecies with those still extant in the same manner as, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, men were led by false analogies to compare the animals of the New\r\nContinent with those of the Old.  Peter Camper, Sommering, and Blumenbach\r\nhad the merit of being the first, by the scientific application of a more\r\naccurate\r\np 273\r\ncomparative anatomy, to throw light on the osteological branch of\r\npalaeontology -- the archaeology of organic life; but the actual geognostic\r\nviews of the doctrine of fossil remains, the felicitous combination of the\r\nzoological character with the order of succession, and the relative ages of\r\nstrata, are due to the labors of George Cuvier and Alexander Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe ancient sedimentary formations and those of transition rocks exhibit, in\r\nthe organic remains contained within them, a mixture of structures very\r\nvariously situated on the scale of progressively-developed organisms.

The 'upper trias', including variegated sandstone,** muschelkalk, and\r\nkeuper.\r\n4.  'Jura limestone' (lias and oolite).\r\n5.  'Green sandstone', the quader sanstein, upper and lower chalk,\r\nterminating the secondary formations, which begin with limestone.\r\n6.  'Tertiary formations' in three divisions, distinguished as granular\r\nlimestone, the lignites, and the sub-Apennine gravel of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Quenstedt, 'Flotzgebirge Wurtembergs', 1843, s. 13.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ** Murchison makes two divisions of the 'bunter sandstone', the\r\nupper being the same as the 'trias' of Alberti, while the lower division, to\r\nwhich the 'Vosges sandstone' of Elie de Beaumont belongs -- the 'zeckstein'\r\nand the 'todtliegende' -- he forms his 'Permian' system.  He makes the\r\nsecondary formations commence with the 'upper trias', that is to say, with\r\nthe upper division of our (German) bunter sandstone, while the  Permian\r\nsystem, the carboniferous or mountain limestone, and the devonian and\r\nsilurian strata, constitute his 'palaeozoic formatiions'.

The oldest transition strata, as we have\r\nalready observed, contain merely cellular marine plants, and it is only in\r\nthe devonian system that a few cryptogamic forms of vascular plants\r\n(Calamites and Lycopodiaceae) have been observed.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Beyrich, in Karsteu's 'Archiv fur Mineralogie', 1844, bd.\r\nxviii., s. 218.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing appears to corroborate\r\np 279\r\nthe theoretical views that have been started regarding the simplicity of\r\nprimitive forms of organic life, ow that vegetable preceded animal life, and\r\nthat the former was necessarily dependent upon the latter.

The species of the genus 'Araucaria' are, however, not\r\npeculiar to the coal formations of the British Islands; they likewise occur\r\nin Upper Silesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis difference of character from our present vegtation, minifested in the\r\nvegetative forms which were so luxuriously developed on the drier\r\np 280\r\nand more elevated portions of the old red sandstone, was maintained through\r\nall the subsequent epochs to the most recent chalk formations; amid the\r\npeculiar characteristics exhibited in the vegetable forms contained in the\r\ncoal measures, there is, however, a strikingly-marked prevalence of the same\r\nfamilies, if not of the same species,* in all parts of the earth as it then\r\nexisted, as in New Holland, Canada, Greenland, and Melville Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote[  *Adolphe Brongniart, 'Prodrome d'une Hist. des Vegetaux\r\nFossiles', p. 179; buckland, 'Geology', p. 479; Endlicher and Unger,\r\n'Grundzuge der Botanik', 1843, s. 455.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the primitive period exhibits forms which, from their\r\nsimultaneous affinity with several families of the present world, testify\r\nthat many intermediate links must have become extinct in the scale of\r\norganic development.  Thus, for example, to mention only two instances, we\r\nwould notice the Lepidodendra, which, according to Lindley, occupy a place\r\nbetween the Coniferae and the Lycopodiaceae*, and the Araucariae and pines,\r\nwhich exhibit some peculiarities in the union of their vascular bundles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"By means of Lepidodendron, a better passage is established\r\nfrom flowering to flowerless plants than by either Equisetum or Cycas, or\r\nany other known genus.\" -- Lindley and Hutton, 'Fossil Flora', vol. ii., p.\r\n53.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if we limit our consideration to the present world alone, we must\r\nregard as highly important the discovery of Cycadeae and Coniferae side by\r\nside with Sagenariae and Lepidodendra in the ancient coal measures.  The\r\nConiferae are not ony allied to Cupuliferae and Betulinae, with which we\r\nfind them associated in lignite formations, but also with Lycopodiaceae.\r\nThe family of the sago-like Cycadeae approaches most nearly to palms in its\r\nexternal appearance, while these plants are specially allied to Coniferae in\r\nrespect to the structure of their blossoms and seed.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Kunth, 'Anordnung der Pflanzenfamilien', in his 'Handb. der\r\nBotanik', s. 307 und 314.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere many beds of coal are superposed over one another, the families and\r\nspecies are not always blended, being most frequently grouped together in\r\nseparate genera; Lycopodiaceae and certain ferns being alone found in one\r\nbed, and Stigmariae and Sigillariae in another.  In order to give some idea\r\nof the luxuriance of the vegetation of the primitive world, and of the\r\nimmense masses of vegetable matter which was doubtlessly accumulated in\r\ncurrents and converted in a moist condition into coal,* I would instance the\r\nSaarbrucker coal measures,\r\np 281\r\nwhere 120 beds are superposed on one another, exclusive of a great many\r\nwhich are less than a foot in thickness; the coal beds at Johnstone, in\r\nScotland, and those in the Creuzot, in Burgundy, are some of them,\r\nrespectively, thirty and fifty feet in thickness,** while in the forests of\r\nour temperate zones, the carbon contained in the trees growing over a\r\ncertain area would hardly suffice, in the space of a hundred years, to cover\r\nit with more than a stratum of seven French lines in thickness.***\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  That coal has not been formed from vegetable fibers charred by\r\nfire, but that it has more probably been produced in the moist way by the\r\naction of sulphuric acid, is strikingly demonstrated by the excellent\r\nobservation made by Goppert (Karsten, 'Archiv fu Mineralogie', bd. xviii.,\r\ns. 530), on the conversion of a fragment of amber-tree into black coal.  The\r\ncoal and the unaltered amber lay side by side.

In comparing\r\nthis bed of carbon, seven lines in thickness, with beds of coal, we must not\r\nomit to consider the enormous pressure to which the latter have been\r\nsubjected from superimposed rock, and which manifests itself in the\r\nflattened form of the stems of the trees found in these subterranean\r\nregions.  \"The so-called 'wood-hills' discovered in 1806 by Sirowatskoi, on\r\nthe south coast of the island of New Siberia, consist, according to\r\nHedenstrom, of horizontal strata of sandstone, aolternating with bituminous\r\ntrunks of trees, forming a mound thirty fathoms in neight; at the summit the\r\nstems were in a vertical position.  The bed of driftwood is visible at five\r\nwersts' distance.\" -- See Wrangel, 'Reise Iangs der Nordkuste von Siberien,\r\nin den Jahren' 1820-24, th. i., s. 102.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the Mississippi, and in the \"wood hills\" of the Siberian\r\nPolar Sea, described by Admiral Wrangel, the vast number of trunks of trees\r\naccumulated by river and sea water currents affords a striking instance of\r\ntheenormous quantities of drift-wood which must have favored the formation\r\nof carboniferous deposition in the island waters and insular bays.  There\r\ncan be no doubt that these beds owe a considerable portion of the substances\r\nof which they consist to grasses, small branching shrubs, and cryptogamic\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe association of palms and Coniferae, which we have indicated as being\r\ncharacteristic of the coal formations, is discoverable throughout almost all\r\nformations to the tertiary period.  In the present condition of the world,\r\nthese genera\r\np 282\r\nappear to exhibit no tendency whatever to occur associated together.  We\r\nhave so accustomed ourselves, although erroneously, to regard Coniferae as a\r\nnorthern form, that I experienced a feeling of surprise when, in ascending\r\nfrom the shores of the South Pacific toward Chilpansingo and the elevated\r\nvalleys of Mexico, between the 'Venta de la Moxonera' and the 'Alto de los\r\nCaxones', 4000 feet above the level of the sea, I rode a whole day through a\r\ndense wood of Pinus occidentalis, where I observed that these trees, which\r\nare so similar to the Weymouth pine, were associated with fan palms*\r\n('Corypha dulcis'), swarming with brightly-colored parrots.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[footnote]  *This corypha is the 'soyate' (in Aztec, zoyatl), or the 'Palma\r\ndulce' of the natives.  See Humboldt and Bonplaud, 'Synopsis Plant.\r\nAEquinoct. Orbis Novi', t. i., p. 302.  Professor Buschmann, who is\r\nprofoundly acquainted with the American languages, remarks, that the 'Palma\r\nsoyate' is so named in Yepe's 'Vocabulario de la Lengua Othomi', and that\r\nthe Aztec word zoyatl (Molina, 'Vocabulario en Lengua Mexicana y\r\nCastellana', p. 25) recurs in names of places, such as Zoyatitlan and\r\nZoyapanco, near Chiapa.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth America has oaks, but not a single species of pine; and the first time\r\nthat I again saw the familiar form of a fir-tree, it was thus associated\r\nwith the strange appearance of the fan palm.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Near Baracoa and Cayos de Moya.

Columbus, who invariably paid the most remarkable attention to all\r\nnatural objects, was the first to observe the difference between\r\n'Podocarpus' and 'Pinus'.  \"I find,\" said he, \"en la tierra aspera del Cibao\r\npinos que no Ilevan pinas (fir cones), pero portal orden compuestos por\r\nnaturaleza, que (los frutos) parecen azeytunas del Axarafe de Sevilla.\"  The\r\ngreat botanist, Richard, when he published his excellent Memoir on Cycadeae\r\nand Coniferae, little imagined that before the time of L'Heritier, and even\r\nbefore the end of the fifteenth century, a navigator had separated\r\n'Podocarpus' from the Abietineae.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Columbus, in his first voyage of discovery, saw Coniferae and\r\npalms growing together on the northeastern extremity of the island of Cuba,\r\nlikewise within the tropics, and scarcely above the level of the sea.  This\r\nacute observer, whom nothing escaped, mentions the fact in his journal as a\r\nremarkable circumstance, and his friend Anghiera, the secretary of Frdinand\r\nthe Catholic, remarks with astonishment \"that 'palmeta' and 'pineta' are\r\nfound associated together in the newly-discovered land.\"  It is a matter of\r\nmuch importance to geology to compare the present distribution of plants\r\nover the earth's surface with that exhibited in the fossil floras of the\r\nprimitive world.  The temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, which is so\r\nrich in seas and islands, and where\r\np 283\r\ntropical forms blend so remarkably with those of colder parts of the earth,\r\npresents according to Darwin's beautiful and animated descriptions,* the\r\nmost instructive materials for the study of the present and the past\r\ngeography of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Charles Darwin, 'Journal of the Voyages of the Adventure and\r\nBeagle', 1839, p. 271.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the primordial ages is, in the strict sense of the word, a\r\npart of the history of plants.\r\n\r\nCycadeae, which, from the number of their fossil species, must have occupied\r\na far more important part in the extinct than in the present vegetable\r\nworld, are associated with the nearly allied Coniferae from the coal\r\nformations upward.  They are almost wholly absent in the epoch of the\r\nvariegated sandstone which contains Coniferae of rare and luxuriant\r\nstructure ('Voltizia, Haidingera, Albertia'); the Cycadeae, however, occur\r\nmost frequently in the keuper and lias strata, in which more than twenty\r\ndifferent forms appear.  In the chalk, marine plants and naiades\r\npredominate.  The forests of Cycadeae of the Jura formations had, therefore,\r\nlong disappeared, and even in the more ancient tertiary formations they are\r\nquite subordinate to the Coniferae and palms.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Goppert describes three other Cycadeae (species of Cycadites\r\nand Pterophyllum), found in the brown carboniferous schistose clay of\r\nAlt-sattel and Commotau, in Bohemia.

The dicotyledonous stems found in lignite\r\nare occasionally distinguished by colossal size and great age.  In the trunk\r\nof a tree found at Bonn, Noggerath counted 792 annual rings.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Buckland, 'Geology', p. 509.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the north of France, at Yseux, near Abbeville, oaks have been discovered\r\nin the turf moors of the Somme which measured fourteen feet in diameter, a\r\nthickness which is very remarkable in the Old Continent and without the\r\ntropics.  According to Goppert's excellent investigations, which, it is\r\nhoped, may soon be illustrated by plates, it would appear that \"all the\r\namber of the Baltic comes from\r\np 284\r\na coniferous tree, which, to judge by the still extant remains of wood and\r\nthe bark at different ages, approaches very nearly to our white and red\r\npines, although forming a distinct species. The amber-tree of the ancient\r\nworld ('Pinites succifer') abounded in resin to a degree far surpassing that\r\nmanifested by any extant coniferous tree; for not only were large masses of\r\namber deposited in and upon the bark, but also in the wood itself, following\r\nthe course of the medullary rays, which, together with ligneous cells, are\r\nstill discernible under the microscope, and peripherally between the rings,\r\nbeing some times both yellow and white.\"\r\n\r\n\"Among the vegetable forms inclosed in amber are male and femald blossoms of\r\nour native needle-wood trees and Cupuliferae, while fragments which are\r\nrecognized as belonging to thuia, cupressus, ephedera, and castania vesca,\r\nblended with those of junipers and firs, indicate a vegetation different\r\nfrom that of the coasts and plains of the Baltic.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *{The forests of amber-pines, 'Pinites succifer', were in the\r\nsoutheastern part of what is now the bed of the Baltic, in about 55 degrees\r\nN. lat., and 37 degrees E. long.  The different colors of amber are derived\r\nfrom local chemical admixture.  The amber contains fragments of vegetable\r\nmatter, and from these it has been ascertained tht the amber-pine forests\r\ncontained four other species of pine (besides the 'Pinites succier'),\r\nseveral cypresses, yews, and junipers, with oaks, poplars, beeches, etc. --\r\naltogether forty-eight species of trees and shrubs, constituting a flora of\r\nNorth American chracter.

Upward of 800 species of insects have been observed;\r\nmost of them belong to species, and even genera, that appear to be distinct\r\nfrom any now known, but others are nearly related to indigenous species, and\r\nsome are identical with existing forms, that inhabit more southern climes.\r\n-- 'Wonders of Geology', vol. i., p. 242, etc.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now passed through the whole series of formations comprised in the\r\ngeological portion of the present work, proceeding from the oldest erupted\r\nrock and the most ancient sedimentary formations to the alluvial land on\r\nwhich are scattered those large masses of rock, the causes of whose general\r\ndistribution have been so long and variously discussed, and which are, in my\r\nopinion, to be ascribed rather to the penetration and violent outpouring of\r\npent-up waters by the elevation of mountain chains than to the motion of\r\nfloating blocks of ice.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leopold von Buch, in the 'Abhandl. der Akad. der Wissensch. zu\r\nBerlin', 1814-15, s. 161; and in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. ix., s. 575; Elie\r\nde Beaumont, in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles', t. xix., p. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most ancient structures of the transition formation\r\np 285\r\nwith which we are acquainted are slate and graywacke, which contain some\r\nremains of sea weeds from the silurian or cambrian sea.  On what did these\r\nso-called 'most ancient' formations rest, if gneiss and mica schist must be\r\nregarded as changed sedimentary strata?  Dare we hazard a conjecture on that\r\nwhich can not be an object of actual geognostic observation?  According to\r\nan ancient Indian myth, the earth is borne up by an elephant, who in his\r\nturn is supported by a gigantic tortoise, in order that he may not fall; but\r\nit is not permitted to the credulous Brahmins to inquire on what the\r\ntortoise rests.  We venture here upon a somewhat similar problem, and are\r\nprepared to meet with opposition in our endeavors to arrive at its soluion.\r\nIn the first formation of the planets, as we stated in the astronomical\r\nportion of this work, it is probable that nebulous rings revolving round the\r\nsun were agglomerated into spheroids, and consolidated by a gradual\r\ncondensation proceeding from the exterior toward the center.  What we term\r\nthe ancient silurian strata are thus only the upper portions of the solid\r\ncrust of the earth.  The erupted rocks which have broken through and\r\nupheaved these strata have been elevated from depths that are wholly\r\ninaccessible to our research; they must, therefore, have existed under the\r\nsilurian strata, and been composed of the same association of minerals which\r\nwe term granite, augite, and quartzose porphyry, when they are made known to\r\nus by eruption through the surface.  Basing our inquiries on analogy, we may\r\nassume that the substances which fill up deep fissures and traverse the\r\nsedimentary strata are merely the ramifications of a lower deposit.  The\r\nfoci of active volcanoes are situated at enormous depths, and judging from\r\nthe remarkable fragments which I have found in various parts of the earth\r\nincrusted in lava currents, I should deem it more than probable tht a\r\nprimordial granite rock forms the substratum of the whole stratified edifice\r\nof fossil remains.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Elie de Beaumont, 'Descr. Geol. de la France', t. i., p.\r\n65; Beaudant, 'Geologie', 1844, p. 269.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasalt containing olivine first shows itself in the period of the chalk\r\ntrachyte still later, while eruptions of granite belong, as we learn from\r\nthe products of their metamorphic action to the epoch of the oldest\r\nsedimentary strata of the transition formation.  Where knowledge can not be\r\nattained from immediate perceptive evidence, we may be allowed from\r\ninduction, no less than from a careful comparison of facts, to hazard a\r\nconjecture by which granite would be restored\r\np 286\r\nto a portion of its contested right and title to be considered as a\r\n'primordial' rock.\r\n\r\nThe recent progress of geognosy, that is to say, the more extended knowledge\r\nof the geognostic epochs characterized by differences of mineral formations,\r\nby the peculiarities and succession of the organisms contained within them,\r\nand by the position of the strata, whether uplifted or inclined\r\nhorizontally, leads us, by means of the causal connection existing among all\r\nnatural phenomena, to the distribution of solids and fluids into the\r\ncontinents and seas which constitute the upper crust of our planet.  We here\r\ntouch upon a point of contact between geological and geographical geognosy\r\nwhich would constitute the complete history of the form and extent of\r\ncontinents.  The limitation of the solid by the fluid parts of the earth's\r\nsurface and their mutual relations of area, have varied very considerably in\r\nthe long series of geognostic epochs.  They were very different, for\r\ninstance, when carboniferous strata were horizontally deposited on the\r\ninclined beds of the mountain limestone and old red sandstone; when lias and\r\noolite lay on a substratum of keuper and muschelkalk, and the chalk rested\r\non the slopes of green sandstone and Jura limestone.  If, with Elie de\r\nBeaumont, we term the waters in which the Jura limestone and chalk formed a\r\nsoft deposit the 'Jurassic or oolitic', and the 'cretaceous seas', the\r\noutlines of these formations will indicate, for the two corresponding\r\nepochs, the boundaries between the already dried land and the ocean in which\r\nthese rocks were forming.  An ingenious attempt has been made to craw maps\r\nof this physical portion of primitive geography and we may consider such\r\ndiagrams as more correct than those of the wanderings of Io or the Homeric\r\ngeography, since the latter are merely graphic representations of mythical\r\nimages, while the former are based upon positive facts deduced from the\r\nscience of geology.\r\n\r\nThe results of the investigations made regarding the areal relations of the\r\nsolid portions of our planet are as follows:  in the most ancient times,\r\nduring the silurian and devonian transition epochs, and in the secondary\r\nformations, including the trias, the continental portions of the earth were\r\nlimited to insular groups covered with vegetation; these islands at a\r\nsubsequent period became united, giving rise to numerous lakes and\r\ndeeply-indented bays; and finally, when the chains of the Pyrenees,\r\nApennines, and Carpathian Mountains were elevated about the period of the\r\nmore ancient tertiary formations, large continents appeared, having almost\r\ntheir present\r\np 287\r\nsize.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[These movements, described in so few words, were doubtless\r\ngoing on for many thousands and tens of thousands of revolutions of our\r\nplanet.  They were accompanied, also, by vast but slow changes of other\r\nkinds.  The expansive force employed in lifting up, by mighty movements, the\r\nnorthern portion of the continent of Asia, found partial vent; and from\r\npartial subsqueous fissures there were poured out the tabular masses of\r\nbasalt occurring in Central India, while an extensive area of depression in\r\nthe Indian Ocean, marked by the coral islands of the Laccadives, the\r\nMaldives, the great Chagos Bank, and some others, were in the course of\r\ndepression by a counteracting movement. -- Ansted's 'Ancient World', p. 346,\r\netc.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the silurian epoch, as well as in that in which the Cycadeae flourished\r\nin such abundance, and gigantic saurians were living, the dry land, from\r\npole to pole, was probably less than it now is in the South Pacific and the\r\nIndian Ocean.  We shall see, in a subsequent part of this work, how this\r\npreponderating quantity of water, combined with other causes, must have\r\ncontributed to raise the temperature and induce a greater uniformity of\r\nclimate.  Here we would only remark in considering the gradual extension of\r\nthe dry land, that, shortly before the 'disturbances' which at longer or\r\nshorter intervals caused the sudden destruction of so great a number of\r\ncolossal vertebrata in the 'diluvial period', some parts of the present\r\ncontinental masses must have been completely separated from one another.\r\nThere is a great similarity in South America and Australia between still\r\nliving and extinct species of animals.  In New Holland, fossil remains of\r\nthe kangaroo have been found, and in New Zealand the semi-foxxilized bones\r\nof an enormous bird, resembling the ostrich, the dinornis of Owen,* which is\r\nnearly allied to the present spteryx, and but little so to the recently\r\nextinct dronte (dodo) of the island of Rodriguez.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[footnote]  *[See 'American Journal of Science', vol. xiv., p. 187; and\r\n'Medals of Creation', vol. ii., p. 817; 'Trans. Zoolog. Society of London',\r\nvol. ii; 'Wonders of Geology', vol. i., p. 129.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form of the continental portions of the earth may, perhaps, in a great\r\nmeasure, owe their elevation above the surrounding level of the water to the\r\neruption of quartzose porphyry, which overthrew with violence the first\r\ngreat vegetation from which the matrial of our present coal measures was\r\nformed.  The portions of the earth's surface which we term plains are\r\nnothing more than the broad summits of hills and mountains whose bases rest\r\non the bottom of the ocean.  Every plain is, therefore, when considered\r\naccording to its submarine relations, an 'elevated plateau', whose\r\ninequalities have been covered over by horizontal deposition of new\r\nsedimentary formations and by the accumulation of alluvium.\r\n\r\np 288\r\nAmong the general subjects of contemplation appertaining to a work of this\r\nnature, a prominent place must be given, first, in the consideration of the\r\n'quantity' of the land raised above the level of the sea, and next, to the\r\nindividual configuration of each part, either in relation to horizontal\r\nextension (relations of form) or to vertical elevation (hypsometrical\r\nrelations of mountain-chains).  Our planet has two envelopes, of which one,\r\nwhich is general -- the atmosphere -- is composed of an elastic fluid, and\r\nthe other -- the sea -- is only locally distributed, surrounding, and\r\ntherefore modifying, the form of the land.  These two envelopes of air and\r\nsea constitute a natural whole, on which depend the difference of climate on\r\nthe earth's surface, according to the relative extension of the aqueous and\r\nsolid parts, the form and aspect of the land, and the direction and\r\nelevation of mountain chains.  A knowledge of the reciprocal action of air,\r\nsea, and land teaches us that great meteorological phenomena can not be\r\ncomprehended when considered independently of geognostic relations.\r\nMeteorology, as well as the geography of plants and animals, has only begun\r\nto make actual progress since the mutual dependence of the phenomena to be\r\ninvestigated has been fully recognized.  The word climate has certainly\r\nspecial reference to the character of the atmosphere, but this character is\r\nitself dependent on the perpetually concurrent influences of the ocean,\r\nwhich is universally and deeply agitated by currents having a totally\r\nopposite temperature, and of radiation from the dry land, which varies\r\ngreatly in form, elevation, color, and fertility, whether we consider its\r\nbare, rocky portions, or those that are covered with arborescent or\r\nherbaceous vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of the surface of our planet, the area of the solid\r\nis to that of the fluid parts as 1:2 4/5ths (according to Rigaud, as\r\n100:270).*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See 'Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society', vcl.\r\nvi., Part ii., 1837, p. 297.  Other writers have given the ratio as 100:284.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe islands form scarcely 1/22d of the continental masses, which are so\r\nunequally divided that they consist of three times more land in the northern\r\nthan in the southern hemisphere; the latter being, therefore, pre-eminently\r\noceanic.  From 40 degrees south latitude to the Antarctic pole the earth is\r\nalmost entirely covered with water.  The fluid element predominates in like\r\nmanner between the eastern shores of the Old and the western shores of the\r\nNew Continent, being only interspersed with some few insular groups.  The\r\nlearned hydrographer Fleurieu has very justly named this\r\np 289\r\nvast oceanic basis, which, under the tropics, extends over 145ºdegrees of\r\nlongitude, the 'Great Ocean', in contradistinction to all other seas.  The\r\nsouthern and western hemispheres (reckoning the latter from the meridian of\r\nTeneriffe) are therefore more rich in water than in any other region of the\r\nwhole earth.\r\n\r\nThese are the main points involved in the consideration of the relative\r\nquantity of land and sea, a relation which exercises so important an\r\ninfluence on the distribution of temperature, the variations in atmospheric\r\npressure, the direction of the winds, and the quantity of moisture contained\r\nin the air, with which the development of vegetation is so essentially\r\nconnected.  When we consider that nearly three fourths of the upper surface\r\nof our planet are covered with water,* we shall be less surprised at the\r\nimperfect condition of meteorology before the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, since it is only during the subsequent period that numerous\r\naccurate observations on the temperature of the sea at different latitudes\r\nand at different seasons have been made and numerically compared together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *In the Middle Ages, the opinion prevailed that the sea covered\r\none seventh of the surface of the globe, an opinion which Cardinal d'Ailly\r\n('Imago Mundi', cap. 8) founded on the fourth apocryphal book of Esdras.\r\nColumbus, who derived a great portion of his cosmographical knowledge from\r\nthe cardinal's work, was much interested in upholding this idea of the\r\nsmallness of the sea, to which the misunderstood expression of \"the ocean\r\nstream\" contributed not a little.  See Humboldt, 'Examen Critique de l'Hist.\r\nde la Geographie', t. i.,\r\np. 186.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horizontal configuration of continents in their general relations of\r\nextension was already made a subject of intellectual contemplation by the\r\nancient Greeks.  Conjectures were advanced regarding the maximum of the\r\nextension from west to east, and Dicaearchus placed it, according to the\r\ntestimony of Agathemerus, in the latitude of Rhodes, in the direction of a\r\nline passing from the Pillars of Hercules to Thine.  This line, which has\r\nbeen termed 'the parallel of the diaphragm of Dicaearchus', is laid down\r\nwith an astronomical accuracy of position, which, as I have stated in\r\nanother work, is well worthy of exciting surprise and admiration.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Agathemerus, in Hudson, 'Geographi Minores', t. ii., p. 4.  See\r\nHumboldt, 'Asie Centr.', t. i., p. 120-125.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrabo, who was probably influenced by Eratosthenes, appears to have been so\r\nfirmly convinced that this parallel of 36 degrees was the maximum of the\r\nextension of the then existing world, that he supposed it had some intimate\r\nconnection with the form of the earth, and therefore places under this line\r\nthe continent whose existence\r\np 290\r\nhe divined in the northern hemisphere, between Theria and the coasts of\r\nThine.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Strabo, lib. i., p. 65, Casaub.  See Humboldt, 'Examen Crit.',\r\nt. i., p. 152.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already remarked, one hemisphere of the earth (whether we divide\r\nthe sphere through the equator or through the meridian of Teneriffe) has a\r\nmuch greater expansion of elevated land than the opposite one:  these two\r\nvast ocean-girt tracts of land, which we term the eastern and western, or\r\nthe Old and New Continents, present, however, conjointly with the most\r\nstriking contrasts of configuration and position of their axes, some\r\nsimilarities of form, especially with reference to the mutual relations of\r\ntheir opposite coasts.  In the eastern continent, the predominating\r\ndirection -- the position of the major axis -- inclines from east to west\r\n(or, more correctly speaking, from southwest to northeast), while in the\r\nwestern continent it inclines from south to north (or, rather, from\r\nsouth-southeast to north-northwest).  Both terminate to the north at a\r\nparallel coinciding nearly with that of 70ºdegrees, while they extend to\r\nthe south in pyramidal points, having submarine prolongations of islands and\r\nshoals.  Such, for instance, are the Archipelago of Tierra del Fuego, the\r\nLagullas Bank south of the Cape of Good Hope, and Van Diemen's Land,\r\nseparated from New Holland by Bass's Straits.  Northern Asia extends to the\r\nabove parallel at Cape Taimura, which, according to Krusenstern, is 78\r\ndegrees 16', while it falls below it from the mouth of the Great\r\nTschukotsehja River eastward to Behring's Straits, in the eastern extremity\r\nof Asia -- Cook's East Cape -- which, according to Beechey, is only 66\r\ndegrees E.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the mean latitude of the Northern Asiatic shores, and the\r\ntrue name of Cape Taimura (Cape Siewere-Wostotschnoi), and Cape Northeast\r\n(Schalagskoi Mys), see Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 35, 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe northern shore of the New Continent follows with tolerable exactness the\r\nparallel of 70 degrees, since the lands to the north and south of Barrow's\r\nStrait, from Boothia Felix and Victoria Land, are merely detached islands.\r\n\r\nThe pyramidal configuration of all the southern extremities of continents\r\nbelongs to the 'similtudines physicae in configuratione mundi', to which\r\nBacon already called attention in his 'Novum Organon', and with which\r\nReinhold Foster, one of Cook's companions in his second voyage of\r\ncircumnavigation, connected some ingenious considerations.  On looking\r\neastward from the meridian of Teneriffe, we perceive that the southern\r\nextremities of the three continents, viz., Africa as the extreme\r\np 291\r\nof the Old World, Australia, and South America, successively approach nearer\r\ntoward the south pole.  New Zealand, whose length extends fully 12 degrees\r\nof latitude, forms an intermediate link between Australia and South America,\r\nlikewise terminating in an island, New Leinster.  It is also a remarkable\r\ncircumstance that the greatest extension toward the south falls in the Old\r\nContinent, under the same meridian in which the extremest projection toward\r\nthe north pole is manifested.  This will be perceived on comparing the Cape\r\nof Good Hope and the Lagullas Bank with the North Cape of Europe, and the\r\npeninsula of Malacca with Cape Taimura in Siberia.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 198-200.  The southern\r\npoint of America, and the Archipelago which we call Terra del Fuego, lie in\r\nthe meridian of the northwestern part of Baffin's Bay, and of the great\r\npolar land, whose limits have not as yet been ascertained, and which,\r\nperhaps, belongs to West Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know not whether the poles of the earth are surrounded by land or by a\r\nsea of ice.  Toward the north pole the parallel of 82 degrees 55' has been\r\nreached, but toward the south pole only that of 78 degrees 10'.\r\n\r\nThe pyramidal terminations of the great continents are variously repeated on\r\na smaller scale, not only in the Indian Ocean and in the peninsulas of\r\nArabia, Hindostan, and Malacca, but also, as was remarked by Eratosthenes\r\nand Polybius, in the Mediterranean, where these writers had ingeniously\r\ncompared together the forms of the Iberian, Italian, and Hellenic\r\npeninsulas.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Strabo, lib. ii., p. 92, 108, Cassaub.\r\n\r\n\r\nEurope, whose area is five times smaller than that of Asia, may almost be\r\nregarded as a multifariously articulated western peninsula of the more\r\ncompact mass of the ontinent of Asia, the climatic relations of the former\r\nbeing to those of the latter as the peninsula of Brittany is to the rest of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 25.  As early as the\r\nyear 1817, in my work 'De distributione Geographica Plantarum, secundum\r\ncaels temperiem et altitudinem Montium', I directed attention to the\r\nimportant influence of compact and of deeply-articulated continents on\r\nclimate and human civilization, \"Regiones vel per sinus lunatos in longa\r\ncornua porrectae, angulois littorum recessibus quasi membratim discerptae,\r\nvel spatia patentia in immensum, quorum littora nullis incisa angulis ambit\r\nsine aufractu oceanus\" (p. 81, 182).  On the relations of the extent of\r\ncoast to the area of a continent (considered in some degree as a measure of\r\nthe accessibility of the interior), see the inquiries in Berghaus, 'Annalen\r\nder Erdkunde', bd. xii., 1835, s. 490, and 'Physikal. Atlas', 1839, No.\r\niii., s. 69.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence exercised by the articulation and higher development of the\r\nform of a continent on the moral and intellectual condition of nations was\r\nremarked by Strabo,* who extols\r\np 292\r\nthe varied form of our small continent as a special advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Strabo, lib. ii., p. 92, 198. Casaub.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica* and South America, which manifest so great a resemblence in their\r\nconfiguration, are also the two continents that exhibit the simplest\r\nlittoral outlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Of Africa, Pliny says (v. 1), \"Nec alia pars terrarum paudiores\r\nrecipit sinus.\"  The small Indian peninsula on this side the Ganges present,\r\nin its triangular outline, a third analogous form.  In ancient Greece there\r\nprevailed an opinion of the regular configuration of the dry land.  There\r\nwere four gulfs or bays, among which the Persian Gulf was placed in\r\nopposition to the Hyrcanian or Caspian Sea (Arrian, vii., 16; Plut., 'in\r\nvita Alexandri', cap. 44; Dionys. Perieg., v. 48 and 630, p. 11, 38,\r\nBernh.).  These four bays and the isthmuses were, according to the optical\r\nfancies of Agesianax, supposed to be reflected in the moon (Plut., 'de Facie\r\nin Orbem Lunae', p. 921, 19).  Respecting the 'terra quadrifida', or four\r\ndivisions of the dry land, of which two lay north and two south of the\r\nequator, see Macrobius, 'Comm. in Somnium Scipionis', ii., 9.  I have\r\nsubmitted this portion of the geography of the ancients, regarding which\r\ngreat confusion prevails, to a new and careful examination, in my 'Examen\r\nCrit. de l'Hist. de la Geogr.', t. i., p. 119, 145, 180-185, as also in\r\n'Asie Centr.', t. ii., p. 172-178.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only the eastern shores of Asia, which, broken as it were by the force\r\nof the currents of the ocean* ('fractas ex aequore terra'), exhibit a\r\nrichly-variegated configuration, peninsulas and contiguous islands\r\nalternating from the equator to 60 degrees north latitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Fleurieu, in 'Voyage de Marchand autour du Monde', t. iv., p.\r\n38-42.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Atlantic Ocean presents all the indications of a valley.  It is as if a\r\nflow of eddying waters had been directed first toward the northeast, then\r\ntoward the northwest, and back again to the northeast.  The parallelism of\r\nthe coasts north of 10 degrees south latitude, the projecting and receding\r\nangles, the convexity of Brazil opposite to the Gulf of Guinea, that of\r\nAfrica under the same parallel, with the Gulf of the Antilles, all favor\r\nthis apparently speculative view.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, in the 'Journal de Physique', liii., 1799, p. 33; and\r\n'Rel. Hist.', t. ii., p. 19; t. iii., p. 189, 198.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this Atlantic valley, as is almost every where the case in the\r\nconfiguration of large continental masses, coasts deeply indented, and rich\r\nin islands, are situated opposite to those possessing a different character.\r\n I long since drew attention to the geognostic importance of entering into a\r\ncomparison of the western coast of Africa and of South America within the\r\ntropics.  The deeply curved indentation of the African continent at Fernando\r\nPo, 4 degrees 30' north latitude, is repeated on the coast of the Pacific at\r\n18 degrees 15' south latitude, between the Valley of Arica and the Morro de\r\nJuan Diaz, where the Peruvian coast suddenly changes the direction from\r\nwouth to north which it had previously followed, and inclines to the\r\nnorthwest.  This change\r\np 293\r\nof direction extends in like manner to the chain of the Andes, which is\r\ndivided into two parallel branches affecting not only the littoral\r\nportions,* but even the eastern Cordilleras.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, in Poggendorf's 'Annalen der Physik', bd. xl., s.\r\n171.  On the remarkable fiord formation at the southeast end of America, see\r\nDarwin's Journal ('Narrative of the Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle',\r\nvol. iii.), 1839, p. 266.  The parallelism of the two mountain chains is\r\nmaintained from 5 degrees north latitude.  The change in the direction of\r\nthe coast at Arica appears to be in consequence of the altered course of the\r\nfissure, above which the Cordillera of the Andes has been upheaved.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the latter, civilization had its earliest seat in the South American\r\nplateaux where the small Alpine lake of Titicaca bathes the feet of the\r\ncolossal mountains of Sorata and Illimani.  Further to the south, from\r\nValdiva and Chiloë (40 degrees to 42 degrees south latitude), through the\r\nArchipelago 'de los Chonos' to 'Terra del Fuego', we find repeated that\r\nsingular configuration of 'fiords' (a blending of narrow and deeply-indented\r\nbays), which in the Northern hemisphere characterizes the western shores of\r\nNorway and Scotland.\r\n\r\nThese are the most general considerations suggested by the study of the\r\nupper surface of our planet with reference to the form of continents, and\r\ntheir expansion in a horizontal direction.  We have collected facts and\r\nbrought forward some analogies of configuration in distant parts of the\r\nearth, but we do not venture to regard them as fixed laws of form.  When the\r\ntraveler on the declivity of an active volcano, as, for instance, of\r\nVesuvius, examines the frequent partial elevations by which portions of the\r\nsoil are often permanently upheaved several feet above their former level,\r\neither immediately precediing or during the continuance of an eruption, thus\r\nforming roof-like or flattened summits, he is taught how accidental\r\nconditions in the expression of the force of subterranean vapors, and in the\r\nresistance to be overcome, may modify the feeble perturbations in the\r\nequilibrium of the internal elastic forces of our planet may have inclined\r\nthem more to its norther than to its southern direction, and caused the\r\ncontinent in the eastern part of the globe to present a broad mass, whose\r\nmajor axis is almost parallel with the equator, while in the western and\r\nmore oceanic part the southern extremity is extremely narrow.\r\n\r\nVery little can be empirically determined regarding the causal connection of\r\nthe phenomena of the formation of continents, or of the analogies and\r\ncontrasts presented by their\r\np 294\r\nconfiguration.  All that we know regarding this subject resolves itself into\r\nthis one point, that the active cause is subterranean; that continents did\r\nnot arise at once in the form they now present, but were, as we have already\r\nobserved, increased by degrees by means of numerous oscillatory elevations\r\nand depressions of the soil, or were formed by the fusion of separate\r\nsmaller continental masses.  Their present form is, therefore, the result of\r\ntwo causes, which have exercised a consecutive action the one on the other;\r\nthe first is the expression of subterranean force, whose direction we term\r\naccidental, owing to our inability to defint it, from its removal from\r\nwithin the sphere of our comprehension, while the second is derived from\r\nforces acting on the surface, among which volcanic eruptions, the elevation\r\nof mountains, and currents of sea water play the principal parts.  How\r\ntotally different would be the condition of the temperature of the earth,\r\nand consequently, of the state of vegetation, husbandry, and human society,\r\nif the major axis of the New Continent had the same direction as that of the\r\nOld Continent; if, for instance, the Cordilleras, instead of having a\r\nsouthern direction, inclined from east to west; if there had been no\r\nradiating tropical continent, like Africa, to the south of Europe; and if\r\nthe Mediterranean, which was once connected with the Caspian and Red Seas,\r\nand which has become so powerful a means of furthering the\r\nintercommunication of nations, had never existed, or if it had been elevated\r\nlike the plains of Lombardy and Cyrene?\r\n\r\nThe changes of the reciprocal relations of height between the fluid and\r\nsolid portions of the earth's surface (changes which, at the same time,\r\ndetermine the outlines of continents, and the greater or lesser submersion\r\nof low lands) are to be ascribed to numerous unequally working causes.  The\r\nmost powerful have incontestably been the force of elastic vapors inclosed\r\nin the interior of the earth, the sudden change of temperature of certain\r\ndense strata,* the unequal secular loss of\r\np 295\r\nheat experienced by the crust and nucleus of the earth, occasioning ridges\r\nin the solid surface, local modifications of gravitation,** and, as a\r\nconsequence of these alterations, in the curvature of a portion of the\r\nliquid element.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *De la Beche, 'Sections and Views illustrative of Geological\r\nPhenomena', 1830, tab. 40; Charles Babbage, 'Observations on the Temple of\r\nSerapis at Pozzuoli, near Naples, and on certain Causes which may produce\r\nGeological Cycles of great Extent', 1834.  \"If a stratum of sandstone five\r\nmiles in thickness should have its temperature raised about 100 degrees, its\r\nsurface would rise twenty-five feet.  Heated beds of clay would, on the\r\ncontrary, occasion a sinking of the ground by their contraction.\"  See\r\nBischof, 'Wurmelehre des Innern unseres Erdkorpers', s. 303, concerning the\r\ncalculations for the secular elevation of Sweden, on the supposition of a\r\nrise by so small a quantity as 7 degrees in a stratum of about 155,000 feet\r\nin thickness, and heated to a state of fusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **The opinion so implicitly entertained regarding the\r\ninvariability of the force of gravity at any given point of the earth's\r\nsurface, has in some degree been controverted by the gradual rise of large\r\nportions of the earth's surface.  See Bessel, 'Ueber Maas und Gewicht', in\r\nSchumacher's 'Jahrbuch fur' 1840, s. 134.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the views generally adopted by geognosists in the present day\r\nand which are supported by the observation of a series of well-attested\r\nfacts, no less than by analogy with the most important volcanic phenomena,\r\nit would appear that the elevation of continents is actual, and not merely\r\napparent or owing to the configuration of the upper surface of the sea.  The\r\nmerit of having advanced this view beloongs to Leopold von Buch, the\r\nnarrative of his memorable 'Travels through Norway and Sweden' in 1806 and\r\n1807.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnnote]  *Th. ii.

Beschr. von\r\nNorwegen',1843, s. 89-116.  If not before Von Buch's travels through\r\nScandinavia, at any rate before their publication, Playfair, in 1802, in his\r\nillustrations of the Huttonian theory, § 393, and according to Keilhau ('Om\r\nLandjardens Stigning in Norge', in the 'Nyt Magazine fur\r\nNaturvidenskaberne'), and the Dane Jessen, even before the time of Playfair,\r\nhad expressed the opinion that it was not the sea which was sinking, but the\r\nsolid land of Sweden which was rising.  Their ideas, however, were wholly\r\nunknown to our great geologist, and exerted no influence on 'Norge\r\nfremstillet efter dets naturlige og borgerlige Tilstand', Kjobenh., 1763,\r\nsought to explain the causes of the changes in the relative levels of the\r\nland and sea, basing his views on the early calculations of Celsius, Kalm,\r\nand Dalin.  He broaches some confused ideas regarding the possibility of an\r\ninternal growth of rocks, but finally declares himself in favor of an\r\nupheaval of the land by earthquakes, \"although,\" he observes, \"no such\r\nrising was apparent immediately after the earthquake of Egersund, yet the\r\nearthquake may have opened the way for other causes producing such an\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the whole coast of Sweden and Finland, from Solvitzborg, on the limits\r\nof Northern Scania, past Gefle to Tornea, and from Tornea to Abo,\r\nexperiences a gradual rise of four feet in a century, the southern part of\r\nSweden is, according to Neilson, undergoing a simultaneous depression.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Berzelius, 'Jahrsbericht uber die Fortschritte der\r\nPhysichen Wiss.', No. 18, s. 686.  The islands of Saltholm, opposite to\r\nCopenhagen, and Bjornholm, however, rise but very little -- Bjornholm\r\nscarcely one foot in a century.  See Forchhammer, in 'Philos. Magazine', 3d\r\nSeries, vol. ii., p. 309.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maximum of this elevating\r\np 296\r\nforce appears to be in the north of Lapland, and to diminish gradually to\r\nthe south toward Calmar and Solvitzborg.  Lines marking the ancient level of\r\nthe sea in pre-historic times are indicated throughout the whole of Norway,*\r\nfrom Cape Lindesnaes to the extremity of the North Cape, by banks of shells\r\nidentical with those of the present seas, and which have lately been most\r\naccurately examined by Bravais during his long winter sojourn at Bosekop.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Keilhan, in 'Nyt Mag. fur Naturvid.', 1832, bd. i., p. 105-254;\r\nbd. ii., p. 57; Bravais, 'Surles Lignes d'ancien Niveau de la Mer', 1843, p.\r\n15-40.  See, also, Darwin, \"on the Parallel Roads of Glen-Roy and Lochaber,\"\r\nin 'Philos. Trans. for' 1839, p. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese banks lie nearly 650 feet above the present mean level of the sea, and\r\nreappear, according to Keilhau and Eugene Robert, in a north-northwest\r\ndirection on the coasts of Spitzbergen, opposite the North Cape.  Leopold\r\nvon Buch, who was the first to draw attention to the high banks of shells at\r\nTromsoe (latitude 69 degrees 40'), has, however, shown that the more ancient\r\nelevations on the North Sea appertain to a different class of phenomena,\r\nfrom the regular and gradual retrogressive elevations of the Swedish shores\r\nin the Gulf of Bothnia.  This latter phenomenon, which is well attested by\r\nhistorical evidence, must not be confounded with the changes in the level of\r\nthe soil occasioned by earthquakes, as on the shores of Chili and of Cutch,\r\nand which have recently given occasion to similar observations in other\r\ncountries.  It has been found that a perceptible sinking resulting from a\r\ndisturbance of the strata of the upper surface sometimes occurs,\r\ncorresponding with an elevation elsewhere, as, for instance, in West\r\nGreenland, according to Pingel and Graah, in Dalmatia and in Scania.\r\n\r\nSince it is highly probable that the oscillatory movements of the soil, and\r\nthe rising and sinking of the upper surface, were more strongly marked in\r\nthe early periods of our planet than at present, we shall be less surprised\r\nto find in the interior of continents some few portions of the earth's\r\nsurface lying below the general level of existing seas.  Instances of this\r\nkind occur in the soda lakes described by General Andreossy, the small\r\nbitter lakes in the narrow Isthmus of Suez, the Caspian Sea, the Sea of\r\nTiberias, and especially the Dead Sea.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 319-324; t. iii., p.\r\n549-551.  The depression of the Dead Sea has been successively determined by\r\nthe barometrical measurements of Count Berton, by the more careful ones of\r\nRussegger, and by the trigonometrical survey of Lieutenant Symond, of the\r\nRoyal Navy, who states that the difference of level between the surface of\r\nthe Dead Sea and the highest houses of Jaffa is about 1605 feet.  Mr.\r\nAlderson, who communicated this result to the Geographical Society of London\r\nin a letter, of the contents of which I was informed by my friend, Captain\r\nWashington, was of opinion (Nov. 28, 1841) that the Dead Sea lay about 1400\r\nfeet under the level of the Mediterranean.  A more recent communication of\r\nLieutenant Symond (Jameson's 'Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal', vol.\r\nxxxiv., 1843, p. 178) gives 1312 feet as the final result of two very\r\naccordant trigonometrical operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe level of the water in the two last-named seas is\r\np 297\r\n666 and 1312 feet below the level of the Mediterranean.  If we could\r\nsuddenly remove the alluvial soil which covers the rocky strata in many\r\nparts of the earth's surface, we should discover how great a portion of the\r\nrocky crust of the earth was then below the present level of the sea.  The\r\nperiodic, although irregularly alternating rise and fall of the water of the\r\nCaspian Sea, of which I have myself observed evident traces in the northern\r\nportions of its basin, appears to prove,* as do also the observations of\r\nDarwin on the coral seas,** that without earthquakes, properly so- called,\r\nthe surface of the earth is capable of the same gentle and progressive\r\noscillations as those which must have prevailed so generally in the earliest\r\nages, when the surface of the hardening crust of the earth was less compact\r\nthan at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'Sur la Mobilite du fond de la Mer Caspienne', in my 'Asie\r\nCentr.', t. ii., p. 283-294.  The Imperial Academy of Sciences of St.\r\nPetersburgh in 1830, at my request, charged the learned physicist Lenz to\r\nplace marks indicating the mean level of the sea, for definite epochs, in\r\ndifferent places near Baku, in the peninsula of Abscheron.  In the same\r\nmanner, in an appendix to the instructions given to Captain (now Sir James\r\nC.) Ross for his Antarctic expedition, I urged the necessity of causing\r\nmarks to be cut in the rocks of the southern hemisphere, as had already been\r\ndone in Sweden and on the shores of the Caspian Sea.  Had this measure been\r\nadopted in the early voyages of Bougainville and Cook, we should now know\r\nwhether the secular relative changes in the level of the seas and land are\r\nto be considered as a general, or merely a local natural phenomenon, and\r\nwhether a law of direction can be recognized in the points which have\r\nsimultaneous elevation or depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **On the elevation and depression of the bottom of the South\r\nSea, and the diffrent areas of alternate movements, see Darwin's 'Journal',\r\np. 557, 561-566.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomena to which we would here direct attention remind us of the\r\ninstability of the present order of things, and of the changes to which the\r\noutlines and configuration of continents are probably still subject at long\r\nintervals of time.  That which may scarcely be perceptible in one\r\ngeneration, accumulates during periods of time, whose duration is revealed\r\nto us by the movement of remote heavenly bodies.  The eastern coast of the\r\nScandinavian peninsula has probably risen\r\np 298\r\nabout 320 feet in the space of 8000 years; and in 12,000 years, if the\r\nmovement be regular, parts of the bottom of the sea which lie nearest the\r\nshores, and are in the present day covered by nearly fifty fathoms of water,\r\nwill come to the surface and constitute dry land.  But what are such\r\nintervals of time compared to the length of the geognostic periods revealed\r\nto us in the stratified series of formations, and in the world of extinct\r\nand varying organisms!  We have hitherto only considered the phenomena of\r\nelevation; but the analogies of observed facts lead us with equal justice to\r\nassume the possibility of the depression of whole tracts of land.  The mean\r\nelevation of the non-mountainous parts of France amounts to less than 480\r\nfeet.  It would not, therefore, require any long period of time, compared\r\nwith the old geognostic periods, in which such great changes were brought\r\nabout in the interior of the earth, to effect the permanent submersion of\r\nthe northwestern part of Europe, and induce essential alterations in its\r\nlittoral relations.\r\n\r\nThe depression and elevation of the solid or fluid parts of the earth --\r\nphenomena which are so opposite in their action that the effect of elevation\r\nin one part is to produce an apparent depression in another -- are the\r\ncauses of all the changes which occur in the configuration of continents.\r\nIn a work of this general character, and in an impartial exposition of the\r\nphenomena of nature, we must not overlook the 'possibility' of a diminution\r\nof the quantity of water, and a constant depression of the level of seas.\r\nThgere can scarcely be a doubt that, at the period when the temperature of\r\nthe surface of the earth was higher, when the waters were inclosed in larger\r\nand deeper fissures, and when the atmosphere possessed a totally different\r\ncharacter from what it does at present, great changes must have occurred in\r\nthe level of seas, depending upon the increase and decrease of the liquid\r\nparts of the earth's surface.  But in the actual condition of our planet,\r\nthere is no direct evidence of a real continuous increase or decrease of the\r\nsea, and we have no proof of any gradual change in its level at certain\r\ndefinite points of observation, as indicated by the mean range of the\r\nbarometer.  According to experiments made by Daussy and Antonio Nobile, an\r\nincrease in the height of the barometer would in itself be attended by a\r\ndepression in the level of the sea.  But as the mean pressure of the\r\natmosphere at the level of the sea is not the same at all latitudes, owing\r\nto meteorological causes depending upon the direction of the wind and\r\nvarying degrees of moisture, the\r\np 299\r\nbarometer alone can not afford a certain evidence of the general change of\r\nlevel in the ocean.  The remarkable fact that some of the ports in the\r\nMediterranean were repeatedly left dry during several hours at the beginning\r\nof this century, appears to show that currents may by changes occurring in\r\ntheir direction and force, occasion a 'local'' retreat of the sea, and a\r\npermanent drying of a small portion of the shore, without being followed by\r\nany actual diminution of water, or any permanent depression of the ocean.\r\nWe must, however, be very cautious in applying the knowledge which we have\r\nlately arrived at, regarding these involved phenomena, since we might\r\notherwise be led to ascribe to water as the elder element, what ought to be\r\nreferred to the two other elements, earth and air.\r\n\r\nAs the 'external' configuration of continents, which we have already\r\ndescribed in their horizontal expansion, exercises, by their variously\r\nindented littoral outlines, a favorable influence on climate, trade, and the\r\nprogress of civilization, so likewise does their internal articulation, or\r\nthe vertical elevation of the soil (chains of mountains and elevated\r\nplateaux), give rise to equally important results.  Whatever produces a\r\npolymorphic diversity of forms on the surface of our planetary habitation --\r\nsuch as mountains, lakes, grassy savannas, or even deserts encircled by a\r\nband of forests -- impresses some peculiar character on the social condition\r\nof the inhabitants.  Ridges of high land covered by snow impede intercourse;\r\nbut a blending of low, discontinued mountain chains* and tracts of valleys,\r\nas we see so happily presented in the west and south of Europe, tends to the\r\nmultiplication of meteorological processes and the products of vegetation,\r\nand, from the variety manifested in different kinds of cultivation in each\r\ndistrict, even under the same degree of latitude, gives rise to wants that\r\nstimulate the activity of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Rel.

This almost\r\nrectangular intersection of geodesic lines exercises an important influence\r\non the commercial relations of Europe, Asia, and the northwest of Africa,\r\nand on the progress of civilization on the formerly more flourishing shores\r\nof the Mediterranean.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 284, 286.  The Adriatic Sea likewise\r\nfollows a direction from S.E. to N.W.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince grand and lofty mountain chains so strongly excite our imagination by\r\nthe evidence they afford of great terrestrial revolutions, and when\r\nconsidered as the boundaries of climates, as lines of separation for waters,\r\nor as the site of a different form of vegetation, it is the more necessary\r\nto demonstrate, by a correct numerical estimation of their volume, how small\r\nis the quantity of their elevated mass when compared with the area of the\r\nadjacent continnents.  The mass of the Pyrenees, for instance, the mean\r\nelevation of whose summits, and the real quantity of whose base have been\r\nascertained by accurate measurements, would if scattered over\r\np 301\r\nthe surface of France, only raise its mean level about 115 feet.  The mass\r\nof the eastern and western Alps would in like manner only increase the\r\nheight of Europe about 21 1/2 feet above its present level.  I have found by\r\na laborious investigation,* which from its nature, can only give a maximum\r\nlimit, that the center of gravity of the volume of the land raised above the\r\npresent level of the sea in Europe and North America is respectively\r\nsituated at an elevation of 671 and 748 feet, while it is at 1132 and 1152\r\nfeet in Asia and South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'De la hauteur Moyenne des Continents', in my 'Asie Centrale',\r\nt. i., p. 82-90, 165-189.  The results which I have obtained are to be\r\nregarded as the extreme value ('nombres-limites').  Laplace's estimate of\r\nthe mean height of continents at 3280 feet is at least three times too high.\r\n The immortal author of the 'Mecanique Celeste' (t. v., p. 14) was led to\r\nthis conclusion by hypothetical views as to the mean depth of the sea.  I\r\nhave shown ('Asie Centr.', t. i., p. 93) that the old Alexandrian\r\nmathematicians, on the testimony of Plutarch ('in Aemilio Paulo', cap. 15),\r\nbelieved this depth to depend on the height of the mountains.  The height of\r\nthe center of gravity of the volume of the continental masses is probably\r\nsubject to slight variations in the course of many centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese numbers show the low level of norther regions.  In Asia the vast\r\nsteppes of Siberia are compensated for by the great elevations of the land\r\n(between the Himalaya, the North Thibetian chain of Kuen-lun, and the\r\nCelestial Mountains), from 28 degrees 30' to 40 degrees north latitude.  We\r\nmay, to a certain extent, trace in these numbers the portions of the Earth\r\nin which the Plutonic forces were most intensely manifested in the interior\r\nby the upheaval of continental masses.\r\n\r\nThere are no reasons why these Plutonic forces may not, in future ages, add\r\nnew mountain systems to those which Elie de Beaumont has shown to be of such\r\ndifferent ages, and inclined in such different directions.  Why should the\r\ncrust of the Earth have lost its property of being elevated in the ridges?\r\nThe recently-elevated mountain systems of the Alps and the Cordilleras\r\nexhibit in Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, in Sorata, Illimani, and Chimborazo,\r\ncolossal elevations which do not favor the assumption of a decrease in the\r\nintensity of the subterranean forces.  All geognostic phenomena indicate the\r\nperiodic alternation of activity and repose;* but the quiet we now enjoy is\r\nonly apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'Zweiter Geologischer Brief von Elie de Beaumont an Alexander\r\nvon Humboldt', in Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd. xxv., s. 1-58.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tremblings which still agitate the surface under all latitudes, and in\r\nevery species of rock, the elevation of Sweden, the appearance of new\r\nislands of eruption, are all conclusive as to the unquiet condition of our\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\np 302\r\nThe two envelopes of the solid surface of our planet -- the liquid and the\r\naeriform -- exhibit, owing to the mobility of their particles, their\r\ncurrents, and their atmospheric relations, many analogies combined with the\r\ncontrasts which arise from the great difference in the condition of their\r\naggregation and elasticity.  The depths of ocean and of air are alike\r\nunknown to us.  At some few places under the tropics no bottom has been\r\nfound with soundings of 276,000 (or more than four miles), while in the air,\r\nif, according to Wollaston, we may assume that it has a limit from which\r\nwaves of sound may be reverberated, the phenomenon of twilight would incline\r\nus to assume a height at least nine times as great.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[See Wilson's Paper, 'On Wollaston's Argument from the\r\nLimitation of the Atmosphere as to the finite Divisibility of Matter.'  --\r\n'Trans. of the Royal Society of Edinb.', vol. xvi., p. 1, 1845.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aërial ocean rests partly on the solid earth, whose mountain chains and\r\nelevated plateaux rise, as we have already seen, like green wooded shoals,\r\nand partly on the sea, whose surface forms a moving base, on which rest the\r\nlower, denser, and more saturated strata of air.\r\n\r\nProceeding upward and downward from the common limit of the aërial and\r\nliquid oceans, we find that the strata of air and water are subject to\r\ndeterminate laws of decrease of temperature.  This decrease is much less\r\nrapid in the air than in the sea, which has a tendency under all latitudes\r\nto maintain its temperature in the strata of water most contiguous to the\r\natmosphere, owing to the sinking of the heavier and more cooled particles.\r\nA large series of the most carefully conducted observations on temperature\r\nshows us that in the ordinary and mean condition of its surface, the ocean\r\nfrom the equator to the forty-eighth degree of north and south latitude is\r\nsomewhat warmer than the adjacent strata of air.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnnote[  *Hamboldt, 'Relation Hist.', t. iii., chap. xxix., p. 514-530.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to this decrease of temperature at increasing depths, fishes and other\r\ninhabitants of the sea, the nature of whose digestive and respiratory organs\r\nfits them for living in deep water, may even, under the tropics, find the\r\nlow degree of temperature and the coolness of climate characteristic of more\r\ntemperate and more northern latitudes.  This circumstance, which is\r\nanalogous to the prevalence of a mild and even cold air on the elevated\r\nplains of the torrid zone, exercises a special influence on the migration\r\nand geographical distribution of many marine animals.  Moreover, the depths\r\nat which fishes live, modify, by the increase of pressure, their cutaneous\r\nrespiration, and the\r\np 303\r\noxygenous and nitrogenous contents of the swimming bladders.\r\n\r\nAs fresh and salt water do not attain the maximum of their density at the\r\nsame degree of temperature, and as the saltness of the sea lowers the\r\nthermometrical degree corresponding to this point, we can understand how the\r\nwater drawn from breat depths of the sea during the voyages of the Kotzebue\r\nand Dupetit-Thouars could have been found to have only the temperature of 37\r\ndegrees and 36.5 degrees.  This icy temperatureof sea water, which is\r\nlikewise manifested at the depths of tropical seas, first led to a study of\r\nthe lower polar currents, which move from both poles toward the equator.\r\nWithout these submarine currents, the tropical seas at those depths could\r\nonly have a temperature equal to the local maximum of cold possessed by the\r\nfalling particles of water at the radiating and cooled surface of the\r\ntropical sea.  In the Mediterranean, the cause of the absence of such a\r\nrefrigeration of the lower strata is ingeniously explained by Arago, on the\r\nassumption that the entrance of the deeper polar currents into the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar, where the water at the surface flows in from the Atlantic\r\nOcean from west to east, is hindered by the submariine counter-currents\r\nwhich move from east to west, from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe ocean, which acts as a general equalizer and moderator of climates,\r\nexhibits a most remarkable uniformity and constancy of temperature,\r\nespecially between 10 degrees north and 10 degrees south latitude,* over\r\nspaces of many thousands of square miles, at a distance from land where it\r\nis not penetrated by currents of cold and heated water.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the series of observations made by me in the South Sea,\r\nfrom 8 degrees 5' to 13 degrees 16' N. lat., in my 'Asie Centrale', t. iii.,\r\np. 234.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has therefore, been justly observed, that an exact and long-continued\r\ninvestigation of these thermic relations of the tropical seas might most\r\neasily afford a solution to the great and much-contested problem of the\r\npermanence of climates and terrestrial temperatures.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *We might (by means of the temperature of the ocean under the\r\ntropics) enter into the consideration of a question which has hitherto\r\nremained unanswered, namely, that of the constancy of terrestrial\r\ntemperatures, without taking into account the very circumscribed local\r\ninfluences arising from the diminution of wood in the plains and on\r\nmountains, and the drying up of lakes and marshes.  Each age might easily\r\ntransmit to the succeeding one some few data, which would perhaps furnish\r\nthe most simple, exact, and direct means of deciding whether the sun, which\r\nis almost the sole and exclusive source of the heat of our planet, changes\r\nits physical constitution and splendor, like the greater number of the\r\nstars, or whether, on the contrary, that luminary has attained to a\r\npermanent condition.\" -- Arago, in the 'Comptes Rendus des Seances de\r\nl'Acad. des Sciences', t. ii., p. 321, 327.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat changes in the luminous disk of the sun would,\r\np 304\r\nif they were of long duration, be reflected with more certainty in the mean\r\ntemperature of the sea than in that of the solid land.\r\n\r\nThe zones at which occur the maxima of the oceanic temperature and of the\r\ndensity (the saline contents) of its waters, do not correspond with the\r\nequator.  The two maxima are separated from one another, and the waters of\r\nthe highest temperature appear to form two nearly parallel lines north and\r\nsouth of the geographical equator.  Lenz, in his voyage of circumnavigation,\r\nfound in the Pacific the maxima of density in 22 degrees north and 17\r\ndegrees south latitude, while its minimum was situated a few degrees to the\r\nsouth of the equator.  In the region of calms the solar heat can exercise\r\nbut little influence on evaporation, because the stratum of air impregnated\r\nwith saline aqueous vapor, which rests on the surface of the sea, remains\r\nstill and unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe surface of all connected seas must be considered as having a general\r\nperfectly equal level with respect to their mean elevation.  Local causes\r\n(probably prevailing winds and currents) may, however, produce permanent,\r\nalthough trifling changes in the level of some deeply indented bays, as for\r\ninstance, the Red Sea.  The highest level of the water at the Isthmus of\r\nSuez is at different hours of the day from 24 to 30 feet above that of the\r\nMediterranean.  The form of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, through which the\r\nwaters appear to find an easier ingress than egress, seems to contribute to\r\nthis remarkable phenomenon, which was known to the ancients.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 321, 327.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe admirable geodetic operations of Coraboeuf and Delcrois show that no\r\nperceptible difference of level exists between the upper surfaces of the\r\nAtlantic and the Mediterranean, along the chain of the Pyrenees, or between\r\nthe coasts of northern Holland and Marseilles.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See the numerical results in p. 328-333 of the volume just\r\nnamed.  From the geodesical levelings which, at my request, my friend\r\nGeneral Bolivar caused to be taken by Lloyd and Falmare, in the years 1828\r\nand 1829, it was ascertained that the level of the Pacific is at the utmost\r\n3 1/2 feet higher than that of the Caribbean Sea; and even that at different\r\nhours of the day each of the seas is in turn the higher, according to their\r\nrespective hours of flood and ebb.  If we reflect that in a distance of 64\r\nmiles, comprising 933 stations of observation, an error of three feet would\r\nbe very apt to occur, we may say that in these new operations we have\r\nfurther confirmation of the equilibrium of the waters which communicate\r\nround Cape Horn.  (Arago, in the 'Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes pour'\r\n1831, p. 319.)  I had inferred from barometrical observations instituted in\r\n1799 and 1804, that if there were any difference between the level of the\r\nPacific and the Atlantic (Carribean Sea), it could not exceed three meters\r\n(nine feet three inches).  See my 'Relat. Hist.', t. iii., p. 555-557, and\r\n'Annales de Chimie', t. i., p. 55-64.  The measurements, which appear to\r\nestablish an excess of height for the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and for\r\nthose of the northern part of the Adriatic Sea, obtained by combining the\r\ntrigonometrical operations of Delcrois and Choppin with those of the Swiss\r\nand Austrian engineers, are open to many doubts.  Notwithstanding the form\r\nof the Adriatic, it is improbable that the level of its waters in its\r\nnorthern portion should be 28 feet higher than that of the Mediterranean at\r\nMarseilles, and 25 feet higher than the level of the Atlantic Ocean.  See my\r\n'Asie Centrale', t. ii., p. 332.\r\n\r\n\r\np 305\r\nDisturbances of equilibrium and consequent movements of the waters are\r\npartly irregular and transitory, dependent upon winds, and producing waves\r\nwhich sometimes, at a distance from the shore and during a storm, rise to a\r\nheight of more than 35 feet; partly regular and periodic, occasioned by the\r\nposition and attraction of the sun and moon, as the ebb and flow of the\r\ntides; and partly permanent, although less intense, occurring as oceanic\r\ncurrents.  The phenomena of tides, which prevail in all seas (with the\r\nexception of the smaller ones that are completely closed in, and where the\r\nebbing and flowing waves are scarcely or not at all perceptible), have been\r\nperfectly explained by the Newtonian doctrine, and thus brought \"within the\r\ndomain of necessary facts.\"  Each of these periodically-recurring\r\noscillations of the waters of the sea has a duration of somewhat more than\r\nhalf a day.  Although in the open sea they scarcely attain an elevation of a\r\nfew feet, they often rise considerably higher where the waves are opposed by\r\nthe configuration of the shores, as for instance, at St. Malo and in Nova\r\nScotia, where they reach the respective elevation of 50 feet, and of 65 to\r\n70 feet.  \"It has been shown by the analysis of the great geometrician\r\nLaplace, that, supposing the depth to be wholly inconsiderable when compared\r\nwith the radius of the earth, the stability of the equilibrium of the sea\r\nrequires that the density of its fluid should be less than that of the\r\nearth; and, as we have already seen, the earth's density is in fact five\r\ntimes greater than that of water.  The elevated parts of the land can not\r\ntherefore be overflowed, nor can the remains of marine animals found on the\r\nsummits of mountains have been conveyed to those localities by any previous\r\nhigh tides.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bessel, 'Ueber Fluth und Ebbe', in Schumacher's 'ahrbuch',\r\n1838, s. 225.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no slight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis material taken from pages 305-362\r\n\r\nCOSMOS: A Sketch of the Physical Description of the Universe, Vol. 1\r\nby Alexander von Humboldt\r\n\r\nTranslated by E C Otte\r\n\r\nfrom the 1858 Harper & Brothers edition of Cosmos, volume 1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\np 305 [balance of p 305 is in file \"09 Humboldt\"]\r\nIt is no slight\r\np 306\r\nevidence of the importance of analysis, which is too often regarded with\r\ncontempt among the unscientific, that Laplace's perfect theory of tides has\r\nenabled us, in our astronomical ephemerides, to predict the height of\r\nspring-tides at the periods of new and full moon, and thus put the\r\ninhabitants of the sea-shore on their guard against the increased danger\r\nattending these lunar revolutions.\r\n\r\nOceanic currents, which exercise so important an influence on the\r\nintercourse of nations and on the climatic relations of adjacent coasts,\r\ndepend conjointly upon various causes, differing alike in nature and\r\nimportance.  Among these we may reckon the periods at which tides occur in\r\ntheir progress round the earth; the duration and intensity of prevailing\r\nwinds; the modifications of density and specific gravity which the particles\r\nof water undergo in consequence of differences in the temperature and in the\r\nrelative quantity of saline contents at different latitudes and depths;*\r\nand, lastly, the horary variations of the atmospheric pressure, successively\r\npropagated from east to west, and occurring with such regularity in the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The relative density of the particles of water depends\r\nsimultaneously on the temperature and on the amount of the saline contents\r\n-- a circumstance that is not sufficiently borne in mind in considering the\r\ncause of currents.  The submarine current, which brings the cold polar water\r\nto the equatorial regions, would follow an exactly opposite course, that is\r\nto say, from the equator toward the poles, if the difference in saline\r\ncontents were alone concerned.  In this view, the geographical distribution\r\nof temperature and of density in the water of the ocean, under the different\r\nzones of latitude and longitude, is of great importance.  The numerous\r\nobservations of Lenz (Poggendorf's 'Annalen', bd. xx., 1830, s. 129), and\r\nthose of Captain Beechey, collected in his 'Voyage to the Pacific', vol.\r\nii., p. 727, deserve particular attention.  See Humboldt, 'Relat. Hist.', t.\r\ni., p. 74, and 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 346.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese currents present a remarkable spectacle; like rivers of uniform\r\nbreadth, they cross the sea in different directions, while the adjacent\r\nstrata of water, which remain undisturbed, form, as it were, the banks of\r\nthese moving streams.  This diffrence between the moving waters and those at\r\nrest is most strikingly manifested where long lines of sea-weed, borne\r\nonward by the current, enable us to estimate its velocity.  In the lower\r\nstrata of the atmosphere, we may sometimes, during a storm, observe similar\r\nphenomena in the limited aerial current, which is indicated by a narrow line\r\nof trees, which are often found to be overthrown in the midst of a dense\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe general movement of the sea from east to west between\r\np 307\r\nthe tropics (termed the equatorial or rotation currnt) is considered to be\r\nowing to the propagation of tides and to the trade winds.  Its direction is\r\nchanged by the resistance it experiences from the prominent eastern shores\r\nof continents.  The results recently obtained by Daussy regarding the\r\nvelocity of this current, estimated from observations made on the distances\r\ntraversed by bottles that had purposely been thrown into the sea, agree\r\nwithin one eighteenth with the velocity of motion (10 French nautical miles,\r\n952 toises each, in 24 hours) which I had found from a comparison with\r\nearlier experiments.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Relat.

See Humboldt, 'Examen Critique', t.\r\nii., p. 254-257, and t. iii., p. 108.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts first impulse and origin is to be sought to the south of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope; after a long circuit it pours itself from the Caribbean Sea and\r\nthe Mexican Gulf through the Straits of the Bahamas, and, following a course\r\nfrom south-southwest to north-northeast, continues to recede from the shores\r\nof the United States, until, further deflected to the eastward by the Banks\r\nof Newfoundland, it approaches the European coasts, frequently throwing a\r\nquantity of tropical seeds ('Mimosa scandens, Guilandina bonduc, Dolichos\r\nurens') on the shores of Ireland, the Hebrides, and Norway.  The\r\nnortheastern prolongation tends to mitigate the cold of the ocean, and to\r\nameliorate the climate on the most northern extremity of Scandinavia.  At\r\nthe point where the Gulf Stream\r\np 308\r\nis deflected from the Banks of Newfoundland toward the east, it sends off\r\nbranches to the south near the Azores.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Examen Crit.', t. iii., p. 64-109\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the situation of the Sargasso Sea, or that great bank of weeds which\r\nso vividly occupied the imagination of Christopher Columbus, and which\r\nOviedo calls the sea-weed meadows ('Praderias de yerva').  A host of small\r\nmarine animals inhabits these tently-moved and evergreen masses of 'Fucus\r\nnatans', one of the most generally distributed of the social plants of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe counterpart of this current (which in the Atlantic Ocean, between\r\nAfrica, America, and Europe, belongs almost exclusively to the northern\r\nhemisphere) is to be found in the South Pacific, where a current prevails,\r\nthe effect of whose low temperature on the climate of the adjacent shores I\r\nhad an opportunity of observing in the autumn of 1802.  It brings the cold\r\nwaters of the high southern latitudes to the coast of Chili, follows the\r\nshores of this continent and of Peru, first from south to north, and is then\r\ndeflected from the Bay of Arica onward from south-southeast to\r\nnorth-northwest.  At certain seasons of the year the temperature of this\r\ncold oceanic current is, in the tropics, only 60 degrees, while the\r\nundisturbed adjacent water exhibits a temperature of 81.5 degrees and 83.7\r\ndegrees.  On that part of the shore of South America south of Payta, which\r\ninclines furthest westward, the current is suddenly deflected in the same\r\ndirection from the shore, turning so sharply to the west that a ship sailing\r\nnorthward passes suddenly from cold into warm water.\r\n\r\nIt is not known to what depth cold and warm oceanic currents propagate their\r\nmotion; but the deflection experienced by the South African current, from\r\nthe Lagullas Bank, which is fully from 70 to 80 fathoms deep, would seem to\r\nimply the existence of a far-extending propagation.  Sand banks and shoals\r\nlying beyond the line of these currents may, as was first discovered by the\r\nadmirable Benjamin Franklin, be recognized by the coldness of the water over\r\nthem.  This depression of the temperature appears to me to depend upon the\r\nfact that, by the propagation of the motion of the sea, deep waters rise to\r\nthe margin of the banks and mix with the upper strata.  My lamented friend,\r\nSir Humphrey Davy, ascribed this phenomenon (the knowledge of which is often\r\nof great practical utility in securing the safety of the navigator) to the\r\ndescent of the particles of water that had been cooled by nocturnal radiation\r\np 309\r\nand which remain nearer to the surface, owing to the hinderance placed in\r\nthe way of their greater descent by the intervention of sand-banks.  By his\r\nobservations Franklin may be said to have converted the thermometer into a\r\nsounding line.  Mists are frequently found to rest over these depths, owing\r\nto the condensation of the vapor of the atmosphere by the cooled waters.  I\r\nhave seen such mists in the south of Jamaica, and also in the Pacific,\r\ndefining with sharpness and clearness the form of the shoals below them,\r\nappearing to the eye as the aerial reflection of the bottom of the sea.  A\r\nstill more striking effect of the cooling produced by shoals is manifested\r\nin the higher strata of air, in a somewhat analogous manner to that observed\r\nin the case of flat coral reefs, or sand islands.  In the open sea, far from\r\nthe land, and when the air is calm, clouds are often observed to rest over\r\nthe spots where shoals are situated, and their bearing may then be taken by\r\nthe compass in the same manner as that of a high mountain or isolated peak.\r\n\r\nAlthough the surface of the ocean is less rich in living forms than that of\r\ncontinents, it is not improbable that, on a further investigation of its\r\ndepths, its interior may be found to possess a greater richness of organic\r\nlife than any other portion of our planet.  Charles Darwin, in the agreeable\r\nnarrative of his extensive voyages, justly remarks that our forests do not\r\nconceal so many animals as the low woody regions of the ocean, where the\r\nsea-weed rooted to the bottom of the shoals, and the severed branches of\r\nfuci, loosened by the force of the waves and currents, and swimming free,\r\nunfold their delicate foliage, upborne by air-cells.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[See 'Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs', by Charles\r\nDarwin, London, 1842.  Also, 'Narrative of the Surveying Voyage of H.M.S.\r\n\"Fly\" in the Eastern Archipelago, during the Years ' 1842-1846, by J. B.\r\nJukes, Naturalist to the expedition, 1847.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of the microscope increases, in the most striking manner,\r\nour impression of the rich luxuriance of animal life in the ocean, and\r\nreveals to the astonished senses a consciousness of the universality of\r\nlife. In the oceanic depths, far exceeding the height of our loftiest\r\nmountain chains, every stratum of water is animated with polygastric\r\nsea-worms, Cyclidiae and Ophrydinae.  The waters swarm with countless hosts\r\nof small luminiferous animalcules, Mammaria (of the order of Acalephae),\r\nCrustacea, Peridinea, and circling Nereides, which when attracted to the\r\nsurface by peculiar meteorological conditions, convert every wave into a\r\nfoaming band of flashing light.\r\n\r\np 310\r\nThe abundance of those marine animalcules, and the animal matter yielded by\r\ntheir rapid decomposition are so vast that the sea water itself becomes a\r\nnutrient fluid to many of the larger animals.  However much this richness in\r\nanimated forms, and this multitude of the most various and highly-developed\r\nmicroscopic organisms may agreeably excite the fancy, the imagination is\r\neven more seriously, and, I might say, more solemnly moved by the impression\r\nof boundlessness and immeasureability, which are presented to the mind by\r\nevery sea voyage.  All who possess an ordinary degree of mental activity,\r\nand delight to create to themselves an inner world of thought, must be\r\npenetrated with the sublime image of the infinite, when gazing around them\r\non the vast and boundless sea, when involuntarily the glance is attracted to\r\nthe distant horizon, where air and water blend together, and the stars\r\ncontinually rise and set before the eyes of the mariner.  This contemplation\r\nof the eternal play of the elements is clouded, like every human joy, by a\r\ntouch of sadness and of longing.\r\n\r\nA peculiar predilection for the sea, and a grateful remenbrance of the\r\nimpression which it has excited in my mind, when I have seen it in the\r\ntropics in the calm of nocturnal rest, or in the fury of the tempest, have\r\nalone induced me to speak of the individual enjoyment afforded by its aspect\r\nbefore I entered upon the consideration of the favorable influence which the\r\nproximity of the ocean has incontrovertibly exercised on the cultivation of\r\nthe intellect and character of many nations, by the multiplication of those\r\nbands which ought to encircle the whole of humanity, by affording additional\r\nmeans of arriving at a knowledge of the configuration of the earth, and\r\nfurthering the advancement of astronomy, and of all other mathematical and\r\nphysical sciences.  A portion of this influence was at first limited to the\r\nMediterranean and the shores of southwestern Africa, but from the sixteenth\r\ncentury it has widely spread, extending to nations who live at a distance\r\nfrom the sea, in the interior of continents.  Since Columbus was sent to\r\n\"unchain the ocean\"* (as the unknown voice whispered to him in a dream when\r\nhe lay on a sick-bed near\r\np 311\r\nthe River Belem), man has ever boldly ventured onward toward the discovery\r\nof unknown regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The voice addressed him in these words, \"Maravillosamente Dios\r\nhizo sonar tu nombre en la tierra; de los atamientos de la mar Oceana, que\r\nestaban cerrados con cadenas tan fuertes, te dió las llaves\" -- \"God will\r\ncause thy name to be wonderfully resounded through the earth, and give thee\r\nthe keys of the gates of the ocean, which are closed with strong chains.\"\r\nThe dream of Columbus is related in the letter to the Catholic monarchs of\r\nJuly the 7th, 1503.  (Humboldt, 'Examen Critique', t. iii., p. 234.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second external and general covering of our planet, the aerial ocean, in\r\nthe lower strata, and on the shoals of which we live, presents six classes\r\nof natural phenomena, which manifest the most intimate connection with one\r\nanother.  They are dependent on the chemical composition of the atmosphere,\r\nthe variations in its transparency, polarization, and color, its density or\r\npressure, its temperature and humidity, and its electricity.  The air\r\ncontains in oxygen the first element of physical animal life, and besides\r\nthis benefit, it possesses another, which may be said to be of a nearly\r\nequally high character, namely, that of conveying sound; a faculty by which\r\nit likewise becomes the conveying sound; a faculty by which it likewise\r\nbecomes the conveyer of speech and the means of communicating thought, and\r\nconsequently of maintaining social intercourse.  If the Earth were deprived\r\nof an atmosphere, as we suppose our moon to be, it would present itself to\r\nour imagination as a soundless desert.\r\n\r\nThe relative quantities of the substances composing the strata of air\r\naccessible to us have, since the beginning of the nineteenth century, become\r\nthe object of investigations, in which Gay-Lussac and myself have taken an\r\nactive part; it is however, only very recently that the admirable labors of\r\nDumas and Boussingault have, by new and more accurate methods, brought the\r\nchemical analysis of the atmosphere to a high degree of perfection.\r\nAccording to this analysis, a volume of dry air contains 20.8 of oxygen, and\r\n79.2 of nitrogen, besides from two to five thousandth parts of carbonic acid\r\ngas, a still smaller quantity of carbureted hydrogen gas,* and, according to\r\nthe important experiments of Saussure and Liebig, traces of ammoniacal\r\nvapors,** from which plants derive their nitrogenous contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Boussingault, 'Recherches sur la Composition de l'Atmosphere',\r\nin the 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique', t. lvii., 1834, p. 171-173; and\r\nlxxi. 1839, p. 116.  According to Boussingault and Lewy, the proportion of\r\ncarbonic acid in the atmosphere at Audilly, at a distance, therefore, from\r\nthe exhalations of a city, varied only between 0.00028 and 0.00031 in volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **Liebig, in his important work, entitles 'Die Organische Chemie\r\nin ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie', 1840, s. 62-72.  On the\r\ninfluence of atmospheric electricity in the production of nitrate of\r\nammonia, which, coming into contact with carbonate of lime, is changed into\r\ncarbonate of ammonia, see Boussingault's 'Economie Rurale consideree dans\r\nses Rapports avec la Chimie et la Meteorologie', 1844, t. ii., p. 247, 267,\r\nand t. i., p. 84.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome observations of Lewy render it probable that the quantity of oxygen\r\nvaries perceptibly\r\np 312\r\nbut slightly, over the sea and in the interior of continents, according to\r\nlocal conditions or to the seasons of the year.  We may easily conceive that\r\nchanges in the oxygen held in solution in the sea, produced by microscopic\r\nanimal organisms, may be attended by alterations in the strata of air in\r\nimmediate contact with it.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Lewy, in the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences', t.\r\nxvii., Part ii., p. 235-248.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air which Martins collected at Faulhorn at an elevation of 8767 feet,\r\ncontained as much oxygen as the air at Paris.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dumas, in the 'Annales de Chimie, 3e Serie', t. iii., 1841, p.\r\n257.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe admixture of carbonate of ammonia in the atmosphere may probably be\r\nconsidered as older than the existence of organic beings on the surface of\r\nthe earth.  The sources from which carbonic acid* may be yielded to the\r\natmosphere are most numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *In this enumeration, the exhalation of carbonic acid by plants\r\nduring the night, while they inhale oxygen, is not taken into account,\r\nbecause the increase of carbonic acid from this source is amply\r\ncounter-balanced by the respiratory process of plants during the day.  See\r\nBoussingault's 'Econ. Rurale', t. i., p. 53-68, and Liebig's 'Organische\r\nChemie', s. 16, 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first place we would mention the respiration of animals, who receive\r\nthe carbon which they inhale from vegetable food, while vegetables receive\r\nit from the atmosphere; in the next place, carbon is supplied from the\r\ninterior of the earth in the vicinity of exhausted volcanoes and thermal\r\nsprings, from the decomposition of a small quantity of carbureted hydrogen\r\ngas in the atmosphere, and from the electric discharges of clouds, which are\r\nof such frequent occurrence within the tropics.  Besides these substances,\r\nwhich we have considered as appertaining to the atmosphere at all heights\r\nthat are accessible to us, there are others accidentally mixed with them,\r\nespecially near the ground, which sometimes, in the form of miasmatic and\r\ngaseous contagia, exercise a noxious influence on animal organization.\r\nTheir chemical nature has not yet been ascertained by direct analysis; but,\r\nfrom the consideration of the processes of decay which are perpetually going\r\non in the animal and vegetable substances with which the surface of our\r\nplanet is covered, and judging from analogies deduced from the comain of\r\npathology, we are led to infer the existence of such noxious local\r\nadmixtures.  Ammoniacal and other nitrogenous vapors, sulphureted hydrogen\r\ngas, and compounds analogous to the polybasic ternary and quaternary\r\ncompounds analogous to the polybasic ternary and quaternary combinations of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, may produce miasmata,*\r\np 313\r\nwhich, under various forms, may generate ague and typhus fever (not by any\r\nmeans exclusively on wet, marshy ground, or on coasts covered by putrescent\r\nmollusca, and low bushes of  'Rhizophora mangle' and Avicennia).\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Gay-Lussac, in 'Annales de Chimie', t. liii., p. 120; Payen,\r\nMem. sur la Composition Chimique des Vegetaux, p. 36, 42; Liebig, 'Org.\r\nChemie', s. 229-345; Boussingault, 'Econ. Rurale', t. i., p. 142-153.\r\n\r\n\r\nFogs which have a peculiar smell at some seasons of the year, remind us of\r\nthese accidental admixtures in the lower strata of the atmosphere.  Winds\r\nand currents of air caused by the heating of the ground even carry up to a\r\nconsiderable elevation solid substances reduced to a fine powder.  The dust\r\nwhich darkens the air for an extended area, and falls on the Cape Verd\r\nIslands, to which Darwin has drawn attention, contains, according to\r\nEhrenberg's discovery, a host of silicious-shelled infusoria.\r\n\r\nAs principal features of a general descriptive picture of the atmosphere, we\r\nmay enumerate:\r\n\r\n1.  'Variations of atmospheric pressure': to which belong the horary\r\noscillations, occurring with such regularity in the tropics, where they\r\nproduce a kind of ebb and flow in the atmosphere, which can not be ascribed\r\nto the attraction of the moon,* and which differs so considerably according\r\nto geographical latitude, the seasons of the year, and the elevation above\r\nthe level of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bouvard, by the application of the formulae, in 1827, which\r\nLaplace had deposited with the Board of Longitude shortly before his death,\r\nfound that the portion of the horary oscillations of the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, which depends on the attraction of the moon, can not raise the\r\nmercury in the barometer at Paris more than the 0.018 of a millimeter, while\r\neleven years' observations at the same place show the mean barometric\r\noscillation, from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M., to be 0.756 millim., and from 3 P.M. to\r\n9 P.M., 0.373 millim.  See 'Memoires de l'Acad. des Sciences', t. vii.,\r\n1827, p. 267.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  'Climatic distribution of heat', which depends on the relative position\r\nof the transparent and opaque masses (the fluid and solid parts of the\r\nsurface of the earth), and on the hypsometrical configuration of continents;\r\nrelations which determine the geographical position and curvature of the\r\nisothermal lines (or curves of equal mean annual temperature) both in a\r\nhorizontal and vertical direction, or on a uniform plane, or in different\r\nsuperposed strata of air.\r\n\r\n3.  'The distribution of the humidity of the atmosphere'.  The quantitative\r\nrelations of the humitidy depend on the differences in the solid and oceanic\r\nsurfaces; on the distance from the equator and the level of the sea; on the\r\nform in which the\r\np 314\r\naqueous vapor is precipitated, and on the connection existing between these\r\ndeposits and the changes of temperature, and the direction and succession of\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\n4.  'The electric condition of the atmosphere'.  the primary cause of this\r\ncondition, when the heavens are serene, is still much contested.  Under this\r\nhead we must consider the relation of ascending vapors to the electric\r\ncharge and the form of the clouds, according to the different periods of the\r\nday and year; the difference between the cold and warm zones of the earth,\r\nor low and high lands; the frequency or rarity of thunder storms, their\r\nperiodicity and formation in summer and winter; the causal connection of\r\nelectricity, with the infrequent occurrence of hail in the night, and with\r\nthe phenomena of water and sand spouts, so ably investigated by Peltier.\r\n\r\nThe horary oscillations of the barometer, which in the tropics present two\r\nmaxima (viz., at 9 or 9 1/4 P.M., and 4 A.M., occurring, therefore, in\r\nalmost the hottest and coldest hours), have long been the object of my most\r\ncareful diurnal and nocturnal observations.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'Observations faites pour constater la Marche des Variations\r\nHoraires du Barometre sous les Tropiques', in my 'Relation Historique du\r\nVoyage aux Regions Equinoxiales', t. iii., p. 270-313.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir regularity is so great, that, in the daytime especially, the hour may\r\nbe ascertained from the height of the mercurial column without an error, on\r\nthe average, of more than fifteen or seventeen minutes.  In the torrid zones\r\nof the New Continent, on the coasts as well as at elevations of nearly\r\n13,000 feet above the level of the sea, where the mean temperature falls  to\r\n44.6 degrees, I have found the regularity of the ebb and flow of the aerial\r\nocean undisturbed by storms, hurricanes, rain, and earthquakes.  The amount\r\nof the daily oscillations diminishes from 1.32 to 0.18 French lines from the\r\nequator to 70 degrees north latitude, where Bravais made very accurate\r\nobservations at Bosekop.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Bravais, in Daemtz and Martins, 'Meteorologie', p. 263.  At\r\nHalle (51 degrees 29' N. lat.), the oscillation still amounts to 0.28 lines.\r\n It would seem that a great many observations will be required in order to\r\nobtain results that can be trusted in regard to the hours of the maximum and\r\nminimum on mountains in the temperate zone.  See the observations of horary\r\nvariations, collected on the Faulhorn in 1832, 1841, and 1842 (Martins,\r\n'Meteorologie', p. 254.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supposition that, much nearer the pole, the height of the barometer is\r\nreally less at 10 A.M. than at 4 P.M., and consequently, that the maximum\r\nand minimum influences of these hours\r\np 315\r\nare inverted, is not confirmed by Parry's observations at Port Bowen (73\r\ndegrees 14').\r\n\r\nThe mean height of the barometer is somewhat less under the equator and in\r\nthe tropics, owing to the effect of the rising current,* than in the\r\ntemperate zones, and it appears to attain its maximum in Western Europe\r\nbetween the parallels of 40 degrees and 45 degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Essai sur la Geographie des Plantes', 1807, p. 90;\r\nand in 'Rel.

The prevailing winds\r\nexercise a principal influence on the diminution of the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, and this, as we have already mentioned, is accompanied,\r\naccording to Daussey, by an elevation of the mean level of the sea.•\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dausay, in the 'Comptes Rendus', t. iii., p. 136.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the most important fluctuations of the pressure of the atmosphere,\r\nwhether occurring with horary or annual regularity, or accidentally, and\r\nthen often attended by violence and danger,* are like all the other\r\nphenomena of the weather, mainly owing to the heating force of the sun's\r\nrays, it has long been suggested (partly according to the idea of Lambert)\r\nthat the direction of the wind should be compared with the height of the\r\nbarometer, alternations of temperature, and the increase and decrease of\r\nhumidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Dove, 'Ueber die Sturme', in Poggend., 'Annalen', bd. lii., s.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\nTables of atmospheric pressure during different winds, termed 'barometric\r\nwindroses', afford a deeper insight into the connection of meteorological\r\nphenomena.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Leopold von Buch, 'Barometrische Windrose', in 'Abhandl. der\r\nAkad. der Wiss. zu Berlin aus den Jahren', 1818-1819, s. 187.\r\n\r\n\r\nDove has, with admirable sagacity, recognized, in the \"law of rotation\" in\r\nboth hemispheres, which he himself established, the cause of many important\r\nprocesses in the aerial ocean.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Dove, 'Meteorologishe Untersuchungen', 1837, s. 99-313; and\r\nthe excellent observations of Kämtz on the descent of the west wind of the\r\nupper current in high latitudes, and the general phenomena of the direction\r\nof the wind, in his 'Vorlesungen uber µeterologie', 1840, s. 58-66,\r\n196-200, 327-336, 353-364; and in Schumacher's 'Jahrbuch fur' 1838, s.\r\n291-302.  A very satisfactory and vivid representation of meteorological\r\nphenomena is given by Dove, in his small work entitled\r\n'Witterungsverhältnisse von Berlin', 1842.  On the knowledge of the earlier\r\nnavigators of the rotation of the wind, see Churruca, 'Viage at Magellanes',\r\n1793, p. 15; and on a remarkable expression of Columbus, which his son Don\r\nFernando Colon has presented to us in his 'Vida del Almirante', cap. 55, see\r\nHumboldt, 'Examen Critique de l'Hist. de Geographie', t. iv., p. 253.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference of temperature between the\r\np 315\r\nequatorial and polar regions engenders two opposite currents in the upper\r\nstrata of the atmosphere and on the Earth's surface.  Owing to the\r\ndifference between the rotatory velocity at the poles and at the equator,\r\nthe polar current is deflected eastward, and the equatorial current\r\nwestward.  The great phenomena of atmospheric pressure, the warming and\r\ncooling of the strata of air, the aqueous deposits, and even, as Dove has\r\ncorrectly represented, the formation and appearance of clouds, alike depend\r\non the opposition of these two currents, on the place where the upper one\r\ndescends, and on the displacement of the one by the other.  Thus the figures\r\nof the clouds, which form an animated part of the charms of a landscape,\r\nannounce the processes at work in the upper regions of the atmosphere, and,\r\nwhen the air is calm, the clouds will often present, on a bright summer sky,\r\nthe \"projected image\" of the radiating soil below.\r\n\r\nWhere this influence of radiation is modified by the relative position of\r\nlarge continental and oceanic surfaces, as between the eastern shore of\r\nAfrica and the western part of the Indian peninsula, its effects are\r\nmanifested in the Indian monsoons, which change with the periodic variations\r\nin the sun's declination,* and which were known to the Greek navigators\r\nunder the name of 'Hippalos'.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'Monsun' (Malayan 'musim', the 'hippalos' of the Greeks) is\r\nderived from the Arabic word 'mausim', a set time or season of the year, the\r\ntime of the assemblage of pilgrims at Mecca.  The word has been applied to\r\nthe seasons at which certain winds prevail, which are, besides, named from\r\nplaces lying in the direction from whence they come; thus, for instance,\r\nthere is the 'mausim' of Aden, of Guzerat, Malabar, etc.  (Lassen, 'Indische\r\nAlterthumskunde', bd. i., 1843, s. 211).  On the contrasts between the solid\r\nor fluid substrata of the atmosphere, see Dove, in 'Der Abhandl. der Akad.\r\nder Wiss. zu Berlin aus dem Jahr' 1842, s. 239.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the knowledge of the monsoons, which undoubtedly dates back thousands of\r\nyears among the inhabitants of Hindostan and China, of the eastern parts of\r\nthe Arabian Gulf and of the western shores of the Malayan\r\np 317\r\nSea, and in the still more ancient and more general acquaintance with land\r\nand sea winds, lies concealed, as it were, the germ of that meteorological\r\nsciences which is now making such rapid progress.  The long chain of\r\n'magnetic stations' extending from Moscow to Pekin, across the whole of\r\nNorthern Asia, will prove of immense importance in determining the 'law of\r\nthe winds', since these stations have also for their object the\r\ninvestigation of general meteorological relations.  The comparison of\r\nobservations made at places lying so many hundred miles apart, will decide,\r\nfor instance, whether the same east wind blows from the elevated desert of\r\nGobi to the interior of Russia, or whether the direction of the Aerial\r\ncurrent first began in the middle of the series of the stations, by the\r\ndescent of the air from the higher regions.  By means of such observations,\r\nwe may learn, in the strictest sense, 'whence' the wind cometh.  If we only\r\ntake the results on which we may depend from those places in which the\r\nobservations on the direction of the winds have been continued more than\r\ntwenty years, we shall find (from the most recent and careful calculations\r\nof Wilhelm Mahlmann) that in the middle latitudes of the temperate zone, in\r\nboth continents, the prevailing aerial current has a west-southwest\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOur insight into the 'distribution of heat' in the atmosphere has been\r\nrendered more clear since the attempt has been made to connect together by\r\nlines those places where the mean annual summer and winter temperatures have\r\nbeen ascertain by correct observations.  The system of 'isothermal,\r\nosotheral' and 'isochimenal' lines, which I first brought into use in 1817,\r\nmay, perhaps, if it be gradually perfected by the united efforts of\r\ninvestigators, serve as one of the main foundations of 'comparative\r\nclimatology'.  Terrestrial magnetism did not acquire a right to be regarded\r\nas a science until partial results were graphically connected in a system of\r\nlines of 'equal declination, equal inclinatiion', and 'equal intensity'.\r\n\r\nThe term 'climate', taken in its most general sense, indicated all the\r\nchanges in the atmosphere which sensibly affect our organs, as temperature,\r\nhumidity, variations in the barometrical pressure, the calm state of the air\r\nor the action of opposite winds, the amount of electric tension, the purity\r\nof the atmosphere or its admixture with more or less noxious gaseous\r\nexhalations, and, finally, the degree of ordinary transparency and clearness\r\nof the sky, which is not only important with respect to the increased\r\nradiation from the Earth, the organic development of plants, and the\r\nripening of fruits, but\r\np 318\r\nalso with reference to its influence on the feelings and mental condition of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIf the surface of the Earth consisted of one and the same homogeneous fluid\r\nmass, or of strata of rock having the same color, density, smoothness, and\r\npower of absorbing heat from the solar rays, and of radiating it in a\r\nsimilar manner through the atmosphere, the isothermal, isotheral, and\r\nisochimenal lines would all be parallel to the equator.  In this\r\nhypothetical condition of the Earth's surface, the power of absorbing and\r\nemitting light and heat would every where be the same under the same\r\nlatitudes.  The mathematical consideration of climate, which does not\r\nexclude the supposition of the existence of currents of heat in the\r\ninterior, or in the external crust of the earth, nor of the propagation of\r\nheat by atmospheric currents, proceeds from this mean, and, as it were,\r\nprimitive condition.  Whatever alters the capacity for absorption and\r\nradiation, at places lying under the same parallel of latitude, gives rise\r\nto inflections in the isothermal lines.  The nature of these inflections,\r\nthe angles at which the isothermal, isotheral, or isochimenal lines\r\nintersect the parallels of latitude, their convexity or concavity with\r\nrespect to the pole of the same hemisphere, are dependent on causes which\r\nmore or less modify the temperature under different degrees of longitude.\r\n\r\nThe progress of 'Climatology' has been remarkably favored by the extension\r\nof European civilization to two opposite coasts, by its transmission from\r\nour western shores to a continent which is bounded on the east by the\r\nAtlantic Ocean.  When, after the ephemeral colonization from Iceland and\r\nGreenland, the British laid the foundation of the first permanent\r\nsettlements on the shores of the United States of America, the emigrants\r\n(whose numbers were rapidly increased in consequence either of religious\r\npersecution, fanaticism, or love of freedom, and who soon spread over the\r\nvast extent of territory lying between the Carolinas, Virginia, and the St.\r\nLawrence) were astonished to find themselves exposed to an intensity of\r\nwinter cold far exceeding that which prevailed in Italy, France, and\r\nScotland, situated in corresponding parallels of latitude.  But, however\r\nmuch a consideration of these climatic relations may have awakened\r\nattention, it was not attended by any practical results until it could be\r\nbased on the numerical data of 'mean annual temperature'.  If, between 58\r\ndegrees and 30 degrees north latitude, we compair Nain, on the coast of\r\nLabrador, with Gottenburg; Halifax with Bordeaus; New\r\np 319\r\nYork with Naples; St. Augustine, in Florida, with Cairo, we find that, under\r\nthe same degrees of latitude, the differences of the mean annual temperature\r\nbetween Eastern America and Western Europe, proceeding from north to south,\r\nare successively 20.7 degrees, 13.9 degrees, 6.8 degrees, and almost 0\r\ndegrees.  The gradual decrease of the differences in this series extending\r\nover 28 degrees of latitude is very striking.  Further to the south, under\r\nthe tropics, the isothermal lines are every where parallel to the equator in\r\nboth hemispheres.  We see, from the above examples, that the questions often\r\nasked in society, how many degrees America (without distinguishing between\r\nthe eastern and western shores) is colder than Europe? and how much the mean\r\nannual temperature of Canada and the United States is lower than that of\r\ncorresponding latitudes in Europe? are, when thus 'generally expressed',\r\ndevoid of meaning.  There is a separate difference for each parallel of\r\nlatitude, and without a special comparison of the winter and summer\r\ntemperatures of the opposite coasts, it will be impossible to arrive at a\r\ncorrect idea of climatic relations, in their influence on agriculture and\r\nother industrial pursuits, or on the individual comfort or discomfort of\r\nmanking in general.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the causes which produce disturbances in the form of the\r\nisothermal lines, I would distinguish between those which 'raise' and those\r\nwhich 'lower' the temperature.  To the first class belong the proximity of a\r\nwestern coast in the temperate zone; the divided configuration of a\r\ncontinent into peninsulas, with deeply-indented bays and inland seas; the\r\naspect of the position of a portion of the land with reference either to a\r\nsea of ice spreading far into the polar circle, or to a mass of continental\r\nland of considerable extent, lying in the same meridian, either under the\r\nequator, or, at least, within a portion of the tropical zone; the prevalence\r\nof southerly or westerly winds on the western shore of a continent in the\r\ntemperate northern zone; chains of mountains acting as protecting salls\r\nagainst the winds coming from colder regions; the infrequency of swamps,\r\nwhich, in the spring and beginning of summer, long remain covered with ice,\r\nand the absence of woods in a dry, sandy soil; finally the constant serenity\r\nof the sky in the summer months, and the vicinity of an oceanic current,\r\nbringing water which is of a higher temperature than that of the surrounding\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes which tend to 'lower' the mean annual temperature I include\r\nthe following:  elevation above the level of the sea, when not forming part\r\nof an extended plain; the\r\np 320\r\nvicinity of an eastern coast in high and middle latitudes; the compact\r\nconfiguration of a continent having no littoral curvatures or bays; the\r\nextension of land toward the poles into the region of perpetual ice, without\r\nthe intervention of a sea remaining open in the winter; a geographical\r\nposition, in which the equatorial and tropical regions are occupied by the\r\nsea, and consequently, the absence, under the same meridian, of a\r\ncontinental tropical land having a strong capacity for the absorption and\r\nradiation of heat; mountain chains, whose mural form and direction impede\r\nthe access of warm winds, the vicinity of isolated peaks, occasioning the\r\ndescent of cold currents of air down their declivities; extensive woods,\r\nwhich hinder the isolation of the soil by the vital activity of their\r\nfoliage, which produces great evaporation, owing to the extension of these\r\norgans, and increases the surface that is cooled by radiation, acting\r\nconsequently in a three-fold manner, by shade, evaporation, and radiation;\r\nthe frequency of swamps or marshes, which in the north form a kind of\r\nsubterranean glacier in the plains, lasting till the middle of the summer; a\r\ncloudy summer sky, which weakens the action of the solar rays; and, finally,\r\na very clear winter sky, favoring the radiation of heat.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Recherches sur les Causes des Inflexions des Lignes\r\nIsothermes', in 'Asie Centr.', t. iii., p. 103-114, 118, 122, 188.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous action of these disturbing causes, whether productive of an\r\nincrease or decrease of heat, determines, as the total effect, the\r\ninflection of the isothermal lines, especially with relation to the\r\nexpansion and configuration of solid continental masses, as compared with\r\nthe liquid oceanic.  These perturbations give rise to convex and concave\r\nsummits of the isothermal curves.  There are, however, different orders of\r\ndisturbing causes, and each one must, therefore, be considered separately,\r\nin order that their total effect may afterward be investigated with\r\nreference to the motion (direction, local curvature) of the isothermal\r\nlines, and the actions by which they are connected together, modified,\r\ndestroyed, or increased in intensity, as manifested in the contact and\r\nintersection of small oscillatory movements.  Such is the method by which, I\r\nhope, it may some day be possible to connect together, by empirical and\r\nnumerically expressed laws, vast series of apparently isolated facts, and to\r\nexhibit the mutual dependence which must necessarily exist among them.\r\n\r\nThe trade winds -- easterly winds blowing within the tropics -- give rise,\r\nin both temperate zones, to the west, or west-southwest\r\np 321\r\nsinds which prevail in those regions, and which are land winds to eastern\r\ncoasts, and sea winds to western coasts, estending over a space which, from\r\nthe great mass and the sinking of its cooled particles, is not capable of\r\nany considerable degree of cooling, and hence it follows that the east winds\r\nof the Continent must be cooler than the west winds, where their temperature\r\nis not affected by the occurrence of oceanic currents near the shore.\r\nCook's young companion on his second voyage of circumnavigation, the\r\nintelligent George Forster, to whom I am indebted for the lively interest\r\nwhich prompted me to undertake distant travels, was the first who drew\r\nattention, in a definite manner, to the climatic differences of temperature\r\nexisting in the eastern and western coasts of both continents, and to the\r\nsimilarity of temperature of the western coast of North America in the\r\nmiddle latitudes, with that of Western Europe.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *George Forster, 'Klein Schriften', th. iii., 1794, s. 87; Dove,\r\nin Schumacher's 'Jahrbuch fur', s. 289; Kämtz, 'Meteorologie', bd. ii., s.\r\n41, 43, 67, and 96; Arago, in the 'Comptes Rendus', t. i., p. 268.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in northern latitudes exact observations show a striking difference\r\nbetween the 'mean annual temperature' of the east and west coasts of\r\nAmerica.  The mean annual temperature of Nain, in   (lat. 57 degrees 10'),\r\nis fully 6.8 degrees 'below' the freezing point, while on the northwest\r\ncoast, at New Archangel, in Russian America (lat. 57 degrees 3'), it is 12.4\r\ndegrees 'above' this point.  At the first-named place, the mean summer\r\ntemperature hardly amounts to 43 degrees, while at the latter place it is 57\r\ndegrees.  Pekin (39 degrees 54'), on the eastern coast of Asia, has a mean\r\nannual tempeerature of 52.8 degrees, which is 9 degrees below that of\r\nNaples, situated somewhat further to the north.  The mean winter temperature\r\nof Pekin is at least 5.4 degrees below the freezing point, while in Western\r\nEurope, even at Paris (48 degrees 50'), it is nearly 6 degrees above the\r\nfreezing point.  Pekin has also a mean winter cold which is 4.5 degrees\r\nlower than that of Copenhagen, lying 17 degrees further to the north.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the slowness with which the great mass of the ocean\r\nfollows the variations of temperature in the atmosphere, and how the sea\r\nacts in equalizing temperatures, moderating simultaneously the severity of\r\nwinter and the heat of summer.  Hence arises a second more important\r\ncontrast -- that, namely, between insular and littoral climates enjoyed by\r\nall articulated continents having deeply indented bays and peninsulas, and\r\nbetween the climate of the interior of great masses of solid land.  This\r\nremarkable contrast has been fully\r\np 322\r\ndeveloped by Leopold von Buch in all its various phenomena, both with\r\nrespect to its influence on vegetation and agriculrure, on the transparency\r\nof the atmosphere, the radiation of the soil, and the elevation of the line\r\nof perpetual snow.  In the interior of the Asiatic Continent, Tobolsk,\r\nBarnaul on the Oby, and Irkutsk, have the same mean summer heat as Berlin,\r\nMunster, and Cherbourg in Normandy, the thermometer sometimes remaining for\r\nweeks together at 86 degrees or 88 degrees, while the mean winter\r\ntemperature is, during the coldest month, as low as -0.4 degrees to -4\r\ndegrees.  These continental climates have therefore justly been termed\r\n'excessive' by the great mathematician and physicist Buffon; and the\r\ninhabitants who live in countries having such 'excessive' climates seem\r\nalmost condemned, as Dante expresses himself,\r\n\"A sofferir tormenti caldi e geli.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[fiitbite]  *Dante, 'Divina Commedia, Purgatorio', canto iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no portion of the earth, neither in the Canary Islands, in Spain, nor in\r\nthe south of France, have I ever seen more luxuriant fruit, especially\r\ngrapes, than in Astrachan, near the shores of the Caspian Sea (46 degrees\r\n21').  Although the mean annual temperature is about 48ºdegrees, the mean\r\nsummer heat rises to 70ºdegrees, as at Bordeaux, while not only there, but\r\nalso further to the south, as at Kislar on the mouth of the Terek (in the\r\nlatitude of Avignon and Rimini), the thermometer sinks in the winter to -13\r\ndegrees or -22 degrees.\r\n\r\nIreland, Guernsey, and Jersey, the peninsula of Brittany, the coasts of\r\nNormandy, and of the south of England, present, by the mildness of their\r\nwinters, and by the low temperature and clouded sky of their summers, the\r\nmost striking contrast to the continental climate of the interior of Eastern\r\nEurope.  In the northeast of Ireland (54 degrees 56'), lying under the same\r\nparallel of latitude as Konigsberg in Prussia, the myrtle blooms as\r\nluxuriantly as in Portugal.  The mean temperature of the month of August,\r\nwhich in Hungary rises to 70 degrees, scarcely reaches 61 degrees at Dublin,\r\nwhich is situated on the same isothermal line of 49 degrees; the mean winter\r\ntemperature, which falls to about 28 degrees at Pesth, is 40 degrees at\r\nDublin (whose mean annual temperature is not more than 49 degrees); 3.6\r\ndegrees higher than that of Milan, Pavia, Padua, and the whole of Lombardy,\r\nwhere the mean annual temperature is upward of 55ºdegrees.  At Stromness,\r\nin the Orkneys, scarcely half a degree further south than Stockholm, the\r\nwinter temperature is 39 degrees, and consequently higher than that of\r\nParis, and neary as high as that of London.\r\np 323\r\nEven in the Faroe Islands, at 62 degrees latitude, the inland waters never\r\nfreeze, owing to the favoring influence of the west winds and of the sea.\r\nOn the charming coasts of Devonshire, near Salcombe Bay, which has been\r\ntermed, on account of the mildness of its climate, the 'Montpellier of the\r\nNorth', the Agave Mexicana has been seen to blossoom in the open air, while\r\norange-trees trained against espaliers, and only slightly protected by\r\nmatting, are found to bear fruit.  There, as well as at Penzance and\r\nGosport, and at Cherbourg on the coast of Normandy, the mean winter\r\ntemperature exceeds 42 degrees, falling short by only 2.4 degrees of the\r\nmean winter temperature of Montpellier and Florence.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Sur les Lignes Isothermes', in the 'Memoires de\r\nPhysique et de Chimie de la Societe d'Arcueil', t. iii., Paris, 1817, p.\r\n143-165; Knight, in the 'Transactions of the Horticultural Society of\r\nLondon', vol. i, p. 32; Watson, 'Remarks on the Geographical Distribution of\r\nBritish Plants', 1835, p. 60; Trevelyan, in Jemieson's 'Edinburgh New Phil.\r\nJournal', No. 18, p. 154; Mahlmann in his admirable German translation of my\r\n'Asie Centrale', th. ii., s. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese observations will suffice to show the important influence exercised on\r\nvegetation and agriculture, on the cultivation of fruit, and on the comfort\r\nof mankind, by differences in the distribution of the same mean annual\r\ntemperature, through the different seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nThe lines which I have termed 'Isochimenal' and 'isotheral' (lines of equal\r\nwinter and equal summer temperature) are by no means parallel with the\r\n'isothermal' lines (lines of equal annual temperature).  If, for instance,\r\nin countries where myrtles grow wild, and the earth does not remain covered\r\nwith snow in the winter, the temperature of the summer and autumn is barely\r\nsufficient to bring apples to perfect ripeness, and if, again, we observe\r\nthat the grape rarely attains the ripeness necessary to convert it into\r\nwine, either in islands or in the vicinity of the sea, even when cultivated\r\non a western coast, the reason must not be sought only in the low degree of\r\nsummer heat, indicated, in littoral situations, by the thermometer when\r\nsuspended in the shade, but likewise in another cause that has not hitherto\r\nbeen sufficiently considered, although it exercises an active influence on\r\nmany other phenomena (as, for instance, in the inflammation of a mixture of\r\nchlorine and hydrogen), namely the difference between direct and diffused\r\nlight, or that which prevails when the sky is clear and when it is overcast\r\nby mist. I long since endeavored to attract the attention of physicists and\r\nphysiologists* to this\r\np 324\r\ndifference, and to the 'unmeasured' heat which is locally developed in the\r\nliving vegetable cell by the action of direct light.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *\"Haec de temperie aeris, qui terram late circumfundit, ac in\r\nquo, longe a solo, instrumenta nostra meteorologica suspensa habemus.

The months of December, January, and February\r\nare reckoned as winter months.  When the different qualities of the wines\r\nproduced in Franconia, and in the countries around the Baltic, are compared\r\nwith the mean summer and autumn temperature of Wurzburg and Berlin, we are\r\nalmost surprised to find a difference of only about two degrees.  The\r\ndifference in the spring is about four degrees.  The influence of late May\r\nfrosts on the flowering season, and after a correspondingly cold winter, is\r\nalmost as important an element as the time of the subsequent ripening of the\r\ngrape.  The difference alluded to in the text between the true temperature\r\nof the surface of the ground and the indications of a thermometer suspended\r\nin the shade and protected from extraneous influences, is inferred by Dove\r\nfrom a consideration of the results of fifteen years' observations made at\r\nthe Chiswick Gardens.  See Dove, in 'Bericht uber die Verhandl. der Berl.\r\nAkad. der Wiss.', August, 1844, s. 285.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Bordeaux, in the valley of the Garonne (44 degrees 50' lat.), the mean\r\nannual winter, summer, and autumn temperatures are respectively 57 degrees,\r\n43 degrees, 71 degrees, and 58 degrees.  In the plains near the\r\np 325\r\nBaltic (52 degrees 30' lat.), where a wine is produced that can scarcely be\r\nconsidered potable, these numbers are as follows:  47.5 degrees, 30 degrees,\r\n63.7 degrees, and 47.5 degrees.  If it should appear strange that the great\r\ndifferences indicated by the influence of climate on the production of wine\r\nshould not be more clearly manifested by our thermometers, the circumstance\r\nwill appear less singular when we remember that a thermometer standing in\r\nthe shade, and protected from the effect of direct insolation and nocturnal\r\nradiation can not, at all seasong of the year, and during all periodic\r\nchanges of heat, indicate the true superficial temperature of the ground\r\nexposed to the whole effect of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nThe same relations which exist between the equable littoral climate of the\r\npeninsula of Brittany, and the lower winter and\r\np 326\r\nhigher summer temperature of the remainder of the continent of France, are\r\nlikewise manifested in some degree, between Europe and the great continent\r\nof Asia, of which the former may be considered to constitute the western\r\npeninsula.  Europe owes its milder climate, in the first place, to its\r\nposition with respect to Africa, whose wide extent of tropical land is\r\nfavorable to the ascending current, while the equatorial region to the south\r\nof Asia is almost wholly oceanic; and next to its deeply-articulated\r\nconfiguration, to the vicinity of the ocean on its western shores; and,\r\nlastly, to the existence of an open sea, which bounds its northern confines.\r\n Europe would therefore become colder* if Africa were to be overflowed by\r\nthe ocean; of if the mythical Atlantis were to arise and connect Europe with\r\nNorth America; or if the Gulf Stream were no longer to diffuse the warming\r\ninfluence of its waters into the North Sea; or if, finally, another mass of\r\nsolid land should be upheaved by volcanic action, and interposed between the\r\nScandinavian peninsula and Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See my memoir, 'Ueber die Haupt-Ursachen der\r\nTemperaturverschiedenheit auf der Erdoberfläche', in the 'Abhandl. der\r\nAkad. der Wissensch. zu Berlin von dem Jahr' 1827, s. 311.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we observe that in Europe the mean annual temperature falls as we\r\nproceed, from west to east, under the same parallel of latitude, from the\r\nAtlantic shores of France through Germany, Poland, and Russia, toward the\r\nUralian Mountains, the main cause of this phenomenon of increasing cold must\r\nbe sought in the form of the continent (which becomes less indented, and\r\nwider, and more compact as we advance), in the increasing distance from\r\nseas, and in the diminished influence of westerly winds.  Beyond the Uralian\r\nMountains these winds are converted into cool land-winds, blowing over\r\nextended tracts covered with ice and show.  The cold of western Siberia is\r\nto be ascribed to these relations of configuration and atmospheric currents,\r\nand not -- as Hippocrates and Trogus Pompeius, and even celebrated travelers\r\nof the eighteenth century conjectures -- to the great elevation of the soil\r\nabove the level of the sea.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The general level of Siberia, from Tobolsk, Tomsk, and Barnaul,\r\nfrom the Altai Mountains to the Polar Sea, is not so high as that of Mauheim\r\nand Dresden; indeed, Irkutsk, far to the east of the Jenisei, is only 1330\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, or about one third lower than Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we pass from the differences of temperature manifested in the plains to\r\nthe inequalities of the polyhedric form of the surface of our planet, we\r\nshall have to consider mountains either in relation to their influence on\r\nthe climate of neighboring\r\np 327\r\nvalleys, or according to the effects of the hyposometrical relations on\r\ntheir own summits, which often spread into elevated plateaux.  The division\r\nof mountains into chains separates the earth's surface into different\r\nbasins, which are often narrow and walled in, forming caldron-like valleys,\r\nand (as in Greece and in part of Asia Minor) constitute an individual local\r\nclimate with respect to heat, moisture, transparancy of atmosphere, and\r\nfrequency of winds and storms.  These circumstances have at all times\r\nexercised a powerful influence on the character and cultivation of natural\r\nproducts, and on the manners and institutions of neighboring nations, and\r\neven on the feelings with which they regard one another.  This character of\r\n'geographical individuality' attains its maximum, if we may be allowed so to\r\nspeak, in countries where the differences in the configuration of the soil\r\nare the greatest possible, either in a vertical or horizontal direction,\r\nboth in relief and in the articulation of the continent.  The greatest\r\ncontrast to these varieties in the relations of the surface of the earth are\r\nmanifested in the Steppes of Northern Asia, the grassy plains (savannahs,\r\nllanos, and pampas) of the New Continent, the heath ('Ericeta') of Europe,\r\nand the sandy and stony deserts of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe law of the decrease of heat with the increase of elevation at different\r\nlatitudes is one of the most important subjects involved in the study of\r\nmeteorological processes, of the geography of plants, of the theory of\r\nterrestrial refraction, and of the various hypotheses that relate to the\r\ndetermination of the height of the atmosphere.  In the many mountain\r\njourneys which I have undertaken, both within and without the tropics, the\r\ninvestigation of this law has always formed a special object of my\r\nresearches.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Recueil d'Observations Astronomiques', t. i., p.\r\n126-140; 'Relation Historique', t. i., p. 119, 141, 227; Biot, in\r\n'Connaissance des Temps pour l'an' 1841, p. 90-109.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we have acquired a more accurate knowledge of the true relations of\r\nthe distribution of heat on the surface of the earth, that is to say, of the\r\ninflections of isothermal and isotheral lines, and their unequal distance\r\napart in the different eastern and western systems of temperature in Asia,\r\nCentral Europe, and North America, we can no longer ask the general\r\nquestion, what fraction of the mean annual or summer temperature corresponds\r\nto the difference of one degree of geographical latitude, taken in the same\r\nmeridian?  In each system of 'isothermal' lines of equal curvature there\r\nreigns a\r\np 328\r\nclose and necessary connection between three elements, namely, the decrease\r\nof heat in a vertical direction from below upward, the difference of\r\ntemperature for every one degree of geographical latitude, and the\r\nuniformity in the mean temperature of a mountain station, and the latitude\r\nof a point situated at the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the system of Eastern America, the mean annual temperature from the coast\r\nof Labrador to Boston changes 1.6ºdegrees for every degree of latitude;\r\nfrom Boston to Charleston about 1.7 degrees; from Charleston to the tropic\r\nof Cancer, in Cuba, the variation is less rapid, being only 1.2 degrees.  In\r\nthe tropics this diminution is so much greater, that from the Havana to\r\nCumana the variation is less than 0.4 degrees for every degree of latitude.\r\n\r\nThe case is quite different in the isothermal system of Central Europe.\r\nBetween the parallels of 38 degrees and 71 degrees I found that the decrease\r\nof temperature was very regularly 0.9degrees for every degree of latitude.\r\nBut as, on the other hand, in Central Europe the decrease of heat is 1.8\r\ndegrees for about every 534 feet of vertical elevation, it follows that a\r\ndifference of elevation of about 267 feet corresponds to the difference of\r\none degree of latitude.  The same mean annual temperature as that occurring\r\nat the Convent of St. Bernard, at an elevation of 8173 feet, in lat. 45\r\ndegrees 50' should therefore be met with at the level of the sea in lat. 75\r\ndegrees 50'.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the Cordilleras which falls within the tropics, the\r\nobservations I made at various heights, at an elevation of upward of 19,000\r\nfeet, gave a decrease of 1 degree for every 341 feet; and my friend\r\nBoussingault found, thirty years afterward, as a mean result, 319 feet.  By\r\na comparison of places in the Cordilleras, lying at an equal elevation above\r\nthe level of the sea, either on the declivities of the mountains or even on\r\nextensive elevated plateaux, I observed that in the latter there was an\r\nincrease in the annual temperature varying from 2.7 degrees to 4.1 degrees.\r\nThis difference would be still greater if it were not for the cooling effect\r\nof nocturnal radiation.  As the different climates are arranged in\r\nsuccessive strata, the one above the other, from the cacao woods of the\r\nvalleys to the region of perpetual snow, and as the temperature in the\r\ntropics varies but little throughout the year, we may form to ourselves a\r\ntolerably correct representation of the climatic relations to which the\r\ninhabitants of the large cities in the Andes are subjected, by comparing\r\nthese climates with the temperatures of particular months in the plains of\r\nFrance and Italy.  While\r\np 329\r\nthe heat which prevails daily on the woody shores of the Orinoco exceeds by\r\n7.2 degrees that of the month of August at Palermo, we find, on ascending\r\nthe chain of the Andes, at Popayan, at an elevation of 3826 feet, the\r\ntemperature of the three summer months of Marseilles; at Quito, at an\r\nelevation of 9541 feet, that of the close of May at Paris; and on the\r\nParamos, at a height of 11,510 feet, where only stunted Alpine shrubs grow,\r\nthough flowers still bloom in abundance, that of the beginning of April at\r\nParis.  The intelligent observer, Peter Martyr de Aughiera, one of the\r\nfriends of Christopher Columbus, seems to have been the first who recognized\r\n(in the expedition undertaken by Rodrigo Enrique Colmenares, in October,\r\n1510) that the limit of perpetual snow continues to ascend as we approach\r\nthe equator.  We read, in the fine work 'De Rebus Oceanicis',*  \"the River\r\nGaira comes from a mountain in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Maria, which,\r\naccording to the testimony of the companions of Colmenares, is higher than\r\nany other mountain hitherto discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Anglerius, 'De Rebus Oceanicis', Dec. xi., lib. ii., p. 140\r\n(ed. Col., 1574).  In the Sierra de Santa Marta, the highest point of which\r\nappears to exceed 19,000 feet (see my 'Relat. Hist.', t. ii., p. 214), there\r\nis a peak that is still called Pico de Gaira.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must undoubtedly be so if 'it retain snow perpetually' in a zone which is\r\nnot more than 10 degrees from the equinoctial line.\"  The lower limit of\r\nperpetual snow, in a given latitude, is the lowest line at which snow\r\ncontinues during summer, or, in other words, it is the maximum of height to\r\nwhich the snow-line recedes in the course of the year.  But this elevation\r\nmust be distinguished from three other phenomena, namely, the annual\r\nfluctuation of the snow-line, the occurrence of sporadic falls of snow, and\r\nthe existence of glaciers, which appear to be peculiar to the temperate and\r\ncold zones.  This last phenomenon, since Saussure's immortal work on the\r\nAlps, has received much light, in recent times, from the labors of Venetz,\r\nCharpentier, and the intrepid and persevering observer Agassiz.\r\n\r\nWe know only the 'lower', and not the 'upper' limit of perpetual snow; for\r\nthe mountains of the earth do not attain to those ethereal regions of the\r\nrarefied and dry strata of air, in which we may suppose, with Bouguer, that\r\nthe vesicles of aqueous vapor are converted into crystals of ice, and thus\r\nrendered perceptible to our organs of sight.  The lower limit of snow is\r\nnot, however, a mere function of geographical latitude or of mean annual\r\ntemperature; nor is it at the equator, or\r\np 330\r\neven, in the region of the tropics, that this limit attains its greatest\r\nelevation above the level of the sea.  The phenomenon of which we are\r\ntreating is extremely complicated, depending on the general relations of\r\ntemperature and humidity, and on the form of the mountains.  On submitting\r\nthese relations to the test of special analysis, as we may be permitted to\r\ndo from the number of determinations that have recently been made,* we shall\r\nfind that the controlling causes are the differences in the temperature of\r\ndifferent seasons of the year; the direction of the prevailing winds and\r\ntheir relations to this land and sea; the degree of dryness or humitidy in\r\nthe upper strata of the air; the absolute thickness of the accumulated\r\nmasses of fallen snow; the relation of the s-line to the total height of the\r\nmountain; the relative position of the latter in the chain to which it\r\nbelongs, and the steepness of its declivity; the vicinity of either summits\r\nlikewise perpetually covered with show; the expansion, position, and\r\nelevation of the plains from which the snow mountain rises as an isolated\r\npeak or as a portion of a chain; whether this plain be part of the\r\nsea-coast, or of the interior of a continent; whether it be covered with\r\nwood or waving grass; and whether, finally, it consist of a dry and rocky\r\nsoil, or of a wet and marshy bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See my table of the height of the line of perpetual snow, in\r\nboth hemispheres, from 71 degrees 15' north lat. to 53 degrees 54' south\r\nlat., in my 'Asie Centrale', t. iii., p. 360.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snow-line which, under the equator in South America, attains an\r\nelevation equal to that of the summit of Mont Blanc in the Alps, and\r\ndescends, according to recent measurements, about 1023 feet lower toward the\r\nnorthern tropic in the elevated plateaux of Mexico (in 19 degrees north\r\nlatitude), rises, according to Pentland, in the southern tropical zone (14\r\ndegrees 30' to 18 degrees south latitude), being more than 2665 feet higher\r\nin the maritime and western branch of the Cordilleras of Chili than under\r\nthe equator near Quito on Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, and Antisana.  Dr. Gilles\r\neven asserts that much further to the south, on the declivity of the volcano\r\nof Peuquenes (latitude 33 degrees), he found the snow-line at an elevation\r\nof between 14,520 and 15,030 feet.  The evaporation of the snow in the\r\nextremely dry air of the summer, and under a cloudless sky, is so powerful,\r\nthat the volcano of Aconcagua, northeast of Valparaiso (latitude 32 degrees\r\n30'), which was found in the expedition of the Beagle to be more than 1400\r\nfeet higher than Chimborazo, was on one occasion seen free from snow.•\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Darwin, 'Journal of the Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle',\r\np. 297.  As the volcano of Aconcagua was not at that time in a state of\r\neruption, we must not ascribe the remarkable phenomenon of this absence of\r\nsnow to the internal heat of the mountain (to the escape of heated air\r\nthrough fissures), as is sometimes the case with Cotopaxi.  Gilles, in the\r\n'Journal of Natural Science', 1830, p. 316.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn\r\np 331\r\nan almost equal northern latitude (from 30 degrees 45' to 31 degrees), the\r\nsnow'line on the southern declivity of the Himalaya lies at an elevation of\r\n12,982 feet, which is about the same as the height which we might have\r\nassigned to it from a comparison with other mountain chains; on the northern\r\ndeclivity, however, under the influence of the high lands of Thibet (whose\r\nmean elevation appears to be about 11,510 feet), the snow-line is situated\r\nat a height of 16,630 feet.  This phenomenon, which has long been contested\r\nboth in Europe and in India, and whose causes I have attempted to develop in\r\nvarious works, published since 1820,* possesses other grounds of interest\r\nthan\r\np 332\r\nthose of a purely physical nature, since it exercises no inconsiderable\r\ndegree of influence on the mode of life of numerous tribes -- the\r\nmeteorological processes of the atmosphere being the controlling causes on\r\nwhich depend the agricultural or pastoral pursuits of the inhabitants of\r\nextensive tracts of continents.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See my 'Second Memoire sur les Montagnes de Inde', in the\r\n'Annales de Chemie et de Physique', t. xiv., p. 5-55; and 'Asie Centrale',\r\nt. iii., p. 281-327.  While the most learned and experienced travelers in\r\nIndia, Colebrooke, Webb, and Hodgson, Victor Jacquemont, Fobes Royle, Carl\r\nvon Hugel, and Vigne, who have all personally examined the Himalaya range,\r\nare agreed, regarding the greater elevation of the snow-line on the\r\nThibeta=ian side, the accuracy of this statement is called in question by\r\nJohn Gerard, by the geognoist MacClelland, the editor of the 'Calcutta\r\nJournal', and by Captain Thomas Hutton, assistant surveyor of the Agra\r\nDivision.  The appearance of my work on Central Asia gave rise to a\r\nrediscussion of this question.  A recent number (vol. iv., January, 1844) of\r\nMacClelland and Griffith's 'Calcutta Journal of Natural History' contains,\r\nhowever, a very remarkable and decisive notice of the determination of the\r\nsnow-line in the Himalaya.  Mr. Batten, of the Bengal service, writes as\r\nfollows from Camp Semulka, on the Cosillah River, Kumaon:  \"In the July,\r\n1843, No. 14 of your valuable Journal of Natural History, which I have only\r\nlately had the opportunity of seeing, I read Captain Hutton's paper on the\r\nsnow of the Himalayas, and as I differed almost entirely from the\r\nconclusions so confidently drawn by that gentleman, I thought it right, for\r\nthe interest of scientific truth, to prepare some kind of answer; as\r\nhowever, on a more attentive perusal, I find that you yourself appear\r\nimplicitly to adopt Captain Hutton's views, and actually use these words,\r\n'We have long been conscious of the error here so well ppointed out by\r\nCaptain Hutton, 'in common with every one who has visited the Himalayas,' I\r\nfeel more inclined to address you, in the first instance, and to ask whether\r\nyou will publish a short reply which I meditate; and whether your not to\r\nCaptain Hutton's paper was written after your own full and careful\r\nexamination of the subject, or merely on a general kind of acquiscence with\r\nthe fact and opinions of your able contributor, who is so well known and\r\nesteemed as a collector of scientific data?  Now I am one who have visited\r\nthe Himalaya on the western side; I have crossed the Borendo or Booria Pass\r\ninto the Buspa Valley, in Lower Kanawar, returning into the Rewaien\r\nMountains of Ghurwal by the Koopin Pass; I have visited the source of the\r\nJumna at Jumnootree; and, moving eastward, the sources of the Kalee or\r\nMundaknee branch of the Ganges at Kadarnath; of the Bishnoo Gunga, or\r\nAluknunda, at Buddrinath and Mana; of the Pindur at the foot of the Great\r\nPeak Nundidavi; of the Dhoulee branch of the Ganges, beyond Neetee, crossing\r\nand recrossing the pass of that name into Thibet; of the Goree or great\r\nbranch of the Sardah, or Kalee, near Oonta Dhoora, beyond Melum.  I have\r\nalso, in my official capacity made the settlement of the Bhote Mehals of\r\nthis province.  My residence of more than six years in the hills has thrown\r\nme constantly in the way of European and native travelers, nor have I\r\nneglected to acquire information from the recorded labors of others.  Yet,\r\nwith all this experience, I am prepared to affirm that 'the perpetual\r\nsnow-line is at a higher elevation' on the northern slope of 'the Himalaya'\r\nthan on the southern slope.\r\n\"The facts mentioned by Captain Hutton appear to me only to refer to the\r\nnorthern sides of all mountains in these regions, and not to affect, in any\r\nway the reports of Captain Webb and others, on which Humboldt formed his\r\ntheory.  Indeed how can any facts of one observer in one place falsify the\r\nfacts of another observer in another place?  I willingly allow that the\r\nnorth side of a hill retains the snow longer and deeper than the south side,\r\nand this observation applies equally to heights in Bhote; but Humboldt's\r\ntheory is on the question of the perpetual snow-line, and Captain Hutton's\r\nreference to Simla and Mussooree, and other mountain sites, are out of place\r\nin this question, or else he fights against a shadow, or an objectioon of\r\nhis own creation.  In no part of his paper does he quote accurately the\r\ndictum which he wishes to oppose.\"\r\nIf the mean altitude of the thibetian highlands be 11,510 feet, they admit\r\nof comparison with the lovely and fruitful plateau of Caxamarca in Peru.\r\nBut at this estimate they would still be 1300 feet lower than the plateau of\r\nBolivia at the Lake of Titicaca, and the causeway of the town of Potosi.\r\nLadak, as appears from Vigne's measurement, by determining the\r\nboiling-point, is 9994 feet high.  This is probably also the altitude of\r\nH'Lassa (Yul-sung), a monastic city, which Chinese writers describe as the\r\n'realm of pleasure', and which is surrounded by vineyards.  Must not these\r\nlie in deep valleys?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the quantity of moisture in the atmosphere increases with the\r\ntemperature, this element, which is so important for the whole organic\r\ncreation, must vary with the hours of the day, the seasons of the year, and\r\nthe differences in latitude and elevation.  Our knowledge of the hygrometric\r\nrelations of the Earth's surface has been very materially augmented of late\r\nyears by the general application of August's psychrometer, framed in\r\naccordance with the views of Dalton and Daniell, for determining the\r\nrelative quantity of vapor, or the\r\np 333\r\ncondition of moisture of the atmosphere, by means of the difference of the\r\n'dew point' and of the temperature of the air.  Temperature, atmospheric\r\npressure, and the direction of the wind, are all intimately connected with\r\nthe vivifying action of atmospheric moisture.  This influence is not,\r\nhowever, so much a consequence of the quantity of moisture held in solution\r\nin different zones, as of the nature and frequency of the precipitation\r\nwhich moistens the ground, whether in the form of dew, mist, rain, or snow.\r\nAccording to the exposition made by Dove of the law of rotation, and to the\r\ngeneral views of this distinguished physicist,* it would appear that, in our\r\nnorthern zone, \"the elastic force of the vapor is greatest with a southwest,\r\nand least with a northeast wind.  On the western side of the windrose this\r\nelasticity diminishes, while it increases on the eastern side; on the former\r\nside, for instance, the cold, dense, and dry current of air repels the\r\nwarmer, lighter current containing an abundance of aqueous vapor, while on\r\nthe eastern side it is the former current which is repulsed by the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Dove, 'Meteorologische Vergleichung  von Nordamerika und\r\nEuropa', in Schumacher's 'Jahrbuch fur' 1841, s. 311; and his\r\n'Meteorologische Untersuchungen', s. 140.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agreeable and fresh verdure which is observed in many trees in districts\r\nwithin the tropics, where, for five or seven months of the yeqar, not a\r\ncloud is seen on the vault of heaven, and where no perceptible dew or rain\r\nfalls, proves that the leaves are capable of extyracting water from the\r\natmosphere by a peculiar vital process of their own, which perhaps is not\r\nalone that of producing cold by radiation.  The absence of rain in the arid\r\nplains of Cumana, Coro, and Ceara in North Brazil, forms a striking contrast\r\nto the quanitity of rain which falls in some tropical regions, as, for\r\ninstance, in the Havana, where it would appear, from the average of six\r\nyears' observation by Ramong de la Sagra, the mean annual quantity of rain\r\nis 109 inches, equal to four or five times that which falls at Paris or at\r\nGeneva.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The mean annual quantity of rain that fell in Paris between\r\n1805 and 1822 was found by Arago to be 20 inches; in London, between 1812\r\nand 1827, it was determined by Howard at 25 inches; while at Geneva the mean\r\nof thirty-two years' observation was 30.5 inches.  In Hindostan, near the\r\ncoast, the quantity of rain is from 115 to 128 inches; and in the island of\r\nCuba, fully 142 inches fell in the year 1821.  With regard to the\r\ndistribution of the quantity of rain in Central Europe, at different periods\r\nof the year, see the admirable researches of Gasparin, Schuow, and Bravais,\r\nin the 'Bibliotheque Universelle', t. xxxvviii., p. 54 and 264; 'Tableau du\r\nClimat de l'Italie', p. 76; and Martins's notes to his excellent French\r\ntranslation of Kämtz's 'Vorlesungen uber Meteorologie', p. 142.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the declivity of the Cordilleras,\r\np 334\r\nthe quantity of rain, as well as the temperature, diminishes with the\r\nincrease in the elevation.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *According to Boussingault ('Economie Rurale', t. ii., p. 693),\r\nthe mean quantity of rain that fell at Marmato (latitude 5 degrees 27',\r\naltitude 4675 feet, and mean temperature 69 degrees) in the years 1833 and\r\n1834 was 64 inches, while at Santa Fe de Bogota (latitude 4 degrees 36',\r\naltitude 8685 feet, and mean temperature 58 degrees) it only amounted to 39\r\n1/2 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy South American fellow-traveler, Caldas, found that, at Santa Fe de\r\nBogota, at an elevation of almost 8700 feet, it did not exceed 37 inches,\r\nbeing consequently little more than on some parts of the western shore of\r\nEurope.  Boussingault occasionally observed at Quito that Saussure's\r\nhygrometer receded to 26 degrees with a temperature of from 53.6 degrees to\r\n55.4 degrees.  Gay-Lussac saw the same hygrometer standing at 25.3 degrees\r\nin his great aerostatic ascent in a stratum of air 7034 feet high, and with\r\na temperature of 39.2 degrees.  The greatest dryness that has yet been\r\nobserved on the surface of the globe in the low lands is probably that which\r\nGustav Rose, Ehrenberg, and myself found in Northern Asia, between the\r\nvalleys of the Irtisch and the Oby.  In the Steppe of Platowskaja, after\r\nsouthwest winds had blown for a long time from the interior of the\r\nContinent, with a temperature of 74.7 degrees, we found the dew point at 24\r\ndegrees.  The air contained only 16/100ths of aqueous vapor.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *For the particulars of this observation, see my 'Asie\r\nCentrale', t. iii., p. 85-89 and 467; and regarding the amount of vapor in\r\nthe atmosphere in the lowlands of tropical South America, consult my 'Relat.\r\nHist.', t. i., p. 242-248; t. ii., p. 45, 164.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accurate observers Kämtz, Bravais, and Martins have raised doubts\r\nduring the last few years regarding the greater dryness of the mountain air,\r\nwhich appeared to be proved by the hygrometric measurements made by Saussure\r\nand myself in the higher regions of the Alps and the Cordilleras.  The\r\nstrata of air at Zurich and on the Faulhorn, which can not be considered as\r\nan elevated mountain when compared with non-European elevations, furnished\r\nthe data employed in the comparisons made by these observers.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Kämtz, 'Vorlesungen uber Meteorologie', s. 117.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the tropical region of the Paramos (near the region where snow begins to\r\nfall, at an elevation of between 12,000 and 14,000 feet), some species of\r\nlarge flowering myrtle-leaved alpine shrubs are almost constantly bathed in\r\nmoisture; but this fqact does not actually prove the existence of any great\r\nand absolute quantity of aqueous vapor at such an elevation, merely affording\r\np 335\r\nan evidence of the frequency of aqueous precipitation, in like manner as do\r\nthe frequent mists with which the lovely plateau of Bogota is covered.\r\nMists arise and disappear several times in the course of an hour in such\r\nelevations as these, and with a calm state of the atmosphere.  These rapid\r\nalternations characterize the Paramos and the elevated plains of the chain\r\nof the Andes.\r\n\r\n'The electricity of the atmosphere', whether considered in the lower or in\r\nthe upper strata of the clouds, in its silent problematical diurnal course,\r\nor in the explosion of the lightning and thunder of the tempest, appears to\r\nstand in a manifold relation to all phenomena of the distribution of heat,\r\nof the pressure of the atmosphere and its disturbances, of hydrometeoric\r\nexhibitions, and probably, also, of the magnetism of the external crust of\r\nthe earth.  It exercises a powerful influence on the whole animal and\r\nvegetable world; not merely by meteorological processes, as precipitations\r\nof aqueous vapor, and of the acids and ammoniacal compounds to which it\r\ngives rise, but also directly as an electric force acting on the nerves, and\r\npromoting the circulation of the organic juices.  This is not a place in\r\nwhich to renew the discussion that has been started regarding the actual\r\nsource of atmospheric eletricity when the sky is clear, a phenomenon that\r\nhas alternately been ascribed to the evaporation of impure fluids\r\nimpregnated with earths and salts,* to the growth of plants,** or to some\r\nother chemical decompositions on the surface of the earth, to the unequal\r\ndistribution of heat in the strata of the air,*** and, finally, according to\r\nPeltier's intelligent researches,**** to the agency of a constant charge of\r\nnegative electricity in the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Regarding the conditions of electricity from evaporation at\r\nhigh temperatures, see Peltier, in the 'Annales de Chimie', t. lxxv., p. 330.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  **Pouillet, in the 'Annales de Chimie', t. xxxv., p. 405.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ***De la Rive, in his admirable 'Essai Historique sur\r\nl'Electricite', p. 140.\r\n\r\n[footnote]  ****Peltier, in the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences', t.\r\nxii., p. 307; Becquerel, 'Traite de l'Electricite et du Magnetisme', t. iv.,\r\np. 107.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimiting itself to results yielded by electrometric observations, such, for\r\ninstance, as are furnished by the ingenious electro-magnetic apparatus first\r\nproposed by Colladon, the physical description of the universe should merely\r\nnotice the incontestable increase of intensity in the general positive\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere,* accompanying an increase of altitude and and\r\nthe absence of trees, its daily variations (which, according to Clark's\r\nexperiments at Dublin,\r\np 336\r\ntake place at more complicated periods than those found by Saussure and\r\nmyself), and its variations in the different seasons of the year, at\r\ndifferent distances from the equator, and in the different relations of\r\ncontinental or oceanic surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Duprez, 'Sur l'Electricite de l'Air' (Bruxelles, 1844), p.\r\n56-61.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe electric equilibrium is less frequently disturbed where the aerial ocean\r\nrests on a liquid base than where it impends over the land; and it is very\r\nstriking to observe how, in extensive seas, small insular groups affect the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere, and occasion the formation of storms.  In fogs,\r\nand in the commencement of falls of snow, I have seen, in a long series of\r\nobservations, the previously permanent positive electricity rapidly pass\r\ninto the negative condition, both on the plains of the colder zones, and in\r\nthe Paramos of the Cordilleras, at elevations varying from 11,000 to 15,000\r\nfeet.  The alternate transition was precisly similar to that indicated by\r\nthe electrometer shortly before and during a storm.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Relation Historique', t. iii., p. 318.  I here only\r\nrefer to those of my experiiments in which the three-foot metallic conductor\r\nof Saussure's electrometer was neither moved upward nor downward, nor,\r\naccording to Volta's proposal, armed with burning sponge.  Those of my\r\nreaders who are well acquainted with the 'quaestiones vexatae' of\r\natmospheric electricity will understand the grounds for this limitation.\r\nRespecting the formation of storms in the tropics, see my 'Rel. Hist.', t.\r\nii., p. 45 and 202-209.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the vesicles of vapor have become condensed into clouds, having\r\ndefinite outlines, the electric tension of the external surface will be\r\nincreased in proportion to the amount of electricity which passes over to it\r\nfrom the separate vesicles of vapor.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Gay-Lussac, in the 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique', t.\r\nviii., p. 167.  In consequence of the discordant views of Lame, Becquerel,\r\nand Peltier, it is difficult to come to a conclusion regarding the cause of\r\nthe specific distribution of electricity in clouds, some of which have a\r\npositive, and others a negative tension.  The negative electricity of the\r\nair, which near high water-falls is caused by a disintegration of the drops\r\nof water -- a fact originally noticed by Tralles, and confirmed by myself in\r\nvarious latitudes -- is very remarkable, and is sufficiently intense to\r\nproduce an appreciable effect on a delicate electrometer at a distance of\r\n300 or 400 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlate-gray clouds are charged, according to Peltier's experiments at Paris,\r\nwith negative, and white, red, and orange-colored clouds with positive\r\nelectricity.  Thunder clouds not only envelop the highest summits of the\r\nchain of the Andes (I have myself seen the electric effect of lightning on\r\none of the rocky pinnacles which project upward of 15,000 feet above the\r\ncrater of the volcano of Toluca), but they have also been observed at a\r\nvertical height of 26,650 feet over the low\r\np 337\r\nlands in the temperate zone.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, in the 'Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes pour' 1838, p.\r\n246.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the stratum of cloud from which the thunder proceeds\r\nsinks to a distance of 5000, or, indeed, only 3000 feet above the plain.\r\n\r\nAccording to Arago's investigations -- the most comprehensive that we\r\npossess on this difficult branch of meteorology -- the evolution of light\r\n(lightning) is of three kinds -- zigzag, and sharply defined at the edges;\r\nin sheets of light, illuminating a whole cloud, which seems to open and\r\nrefeal the light within it; and in the form of fire-balls.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, op. cit., p. 249-266.  (See also, p. 268-279.)\r\n\r\nThe duration of the two first kinds scarcely continues the thousandth part\r\nof a second; but the globular lightning moves much more slowly remaining\r\nvisible for several seconds.  Occasionally (as is proved by the recent\r\nobservations, which have confirmed the description given by Nicholson and\r\nBeccaria of this phenomenon), isolated clouds, standing high above the\r\nhorizon, continue uninterruptedly for some time to emit a luminous radiance\r\nfrom their interior and from their margins, although there is no thunder to\r\nbe heard, and no indication of a storm; in some cases even hail-stones,\r\ndrops of rain, and flakes of snow have been seen to fall in a luminous\r\ncondition, when the phenomenon was not preceded by thunder.  In the\r\ngeographical distribution of storms, the Peruvian coast, which is not\r\nvisited by thunder or lightning, presents the most striking contrast to the\r\nrest of the tropical zone, in which, at certain seasons of the year,\r\nthunder-storms occur almost daily, about four or five hours after the sun\r\nhas reached the meridian.  According to the abundant evidence collected by\r\nArago* from the testiimony of navigators (Scoresby, Parry, Ross, and\r\nFranklin), there can be no doubt that, in general, electric explosions are\r\nextremely rare in high northern regions (between 70 degrees and 75 degrees\r\nlatitude).\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Arago, op. cit., p. 388-391.  The learned academician Von Baer,\r\nwho has done so much for the meteorology of Northern Asia, has not taken\r\ninto consideration the extreme rarity of storms in Iceland and Greenland; he\r\nhas only remarked ('Bulletin de l'Academie de St. Petersbourg', 1839, Mai)\r\nthat in Nova Zembla and Spitzbergen it is sometimes heard to thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n'The meteorological portion' of the descriptive history of nature which we\r\nare now concluding shows that the processes of the absorption of light, the\r\nliberation of heat, and the variations in the elastic and electric tension,\r\nand in the hygrometric condition of the vast aerial ocean, are all so\r\nintimately connected together, that each individual meteorological process\r\nis modified by the action of all the others.  The complicated\r\np 338\r\nnature of these disturbing causes (which involuntarily remind us of those\r\nwhich the near and especially the smallest cosmical bodies, the satellites,\r\ncomets, and shooting stars, are subjected to in their course) increases the\r\ndifficulty of giving a full explanation of these involved meteorological\r\nphenomena, and likewise limits, or wholly precludes, the possibility of that\r\npredetermination of atmospheric changes which would be so important for\r\nhorticulture, agriculture, and navigation, no less than for the comfort and\r\nenjoyment of life.  Those who place the value of meteorology in this\r\nproblematic species of prediction rather than in the knowledge of the\r\nphenomena themselves, are firmly convinced that this branch of science, on\r\naccount of which so many expeditions to distant mountainous regions have\r\nbeen undertaken, has not made any very considerable progress for centuries\r\npast.  The confidence which they refuse to the physicist they yield to\r\nchanges of the moon, and to certain days marked in the calendar by the\r\nsuperstition of a by-gone age.\r\n\r\n\"Great local deviations from the distribution of the mean temperature are of\r\nrare occurrence, the variations being in general uniformly distributed over\r\nextensive tracts of land.  the deviation, after attaining its maximum at a\r\ncertain point, gradually decreases to its limits; when these are passed,\r\nhowever, decided deviations are observed in the 'opposite direction'.\r\nSimilar relations of weather extend more frequently from south to north than\r\nfrom west to east.  At the close of the year 1829 (when I had just completed\r\nmy Siberian journey), the maximum of cold was at Berlin, while North America\r\nenjoyed an unusually high temperature.  It is an entirely arbitrary\r\nassumption to believe that a hot summer succeeds a severe winter, and that a\r\ncool summer is preceded by a mild winter.\"  Opposite relations of weather in\r\ncontiguous countries, or in two corn-growing continents, give rise to a\r\nbeneficient equalization in the prices of the products of the vine, and of\r\nagricultural and horticultural cultivation.  It has been justy remarked,\r\nthat it is the barometer alone which indicates to us the changes that occur\r\nin the pressure of the air throughout all the aerial strata from the place\r\nof observation to the extremest confines of the atmosphere, while* the\r\nthermometer and psychrometer only acquaint us with all the variations\r\noccurring in the local heat and moisture of the lower strata of\r\np 339\r\nair in contact with the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Kämtz, in Schumacher's 'Jahrbuch fur' 1838, s. 285.  Regarding\r\nthe opposite distribution of heat in the east and the west of Europe and\r\nNorth America, see Dove, 'Repertorium der Physik', bd. iii., s. 392-395.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous thermic and hygrometric modifications of the upper regions\r\nof the air can only be learned (when direct observations on mountain\r\nstations or aerostatic ascents are impracticable) from hypothetical\r\ncombinations, by making the barometer serve both as a thermometer and an\r\nhygrometer.  Important changes of weather are not owing to merely local\r\ncauses, situated at the place of observation, but are the consequence of a\r\ndisturbance in the equilibrium of the aerial currents at a great distance\r\nfrom the surface of the Earth, in the higher strata of the atmosphere,\r\nbringing cold or warm, dry or moist air, rendering the sky cloudy or serene,\r\nand converting the accumulated masses of clouds into light feathery 'cirri'.\r\n As, therefore, the inaccessibility of the phenomenon is added to the\r\nmanifold nature and complication of the disturbances, it has always appeared\r\nto me that meteorology must first seek its foundation and progress in the\r\ntorrid zone, where the variations of the atmospheric pressure, the course of\r\nhydro-meteors, and the phenomena of electric explosion, are all of periodic\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nAs we have now passed in review the whole sphere of inorganic terrestrial\r\nlife, and have briefly considered our planet with reference to its form, its\r\ninternal heat, its electro-magnetic tension, its phenomena of polar light,\r\nthe volcanic reaction of its interior on its variously composed solid crust,\r\nand, lastly, the phenomena of its two-fold envelopes -- the aerial and\r\nliquid ocean -- we might, in accordance with the older method of treating\r\nphysical geography, consider that we had completed our descriptive history\r\nof the globe.  But the nobler aim I have proposed to myself, of raising the\r\ncontemplation of nature to a more elevated point of view, would be defeated,\r\nand this delineation of nature would appear to lose its most attractive\r\ncharm, if it did not also include the sphere of organic life in the many\r\nstages of its typical development.  The idea of vitality is so intimatey\r\nassociated with the idea of the existence of the active, ever-blending\r\nnatural forces which animate the terrestrial sphere, that the creation of\r\nplants and animals is ascribed in the most ancient mythical representations\r\nof many nations to these forces, while the condition of the surface of our\r\nplanet, before it was animated by vital forms, is regarded as coeval with\r\nthe epoch of a chaotic conflict of the struggling elements.  But the\r\nempirical domain of objective contemplation, and the delineation of our\r\nplanet in its present condition, do not include a consideration\r\np 340\r\nof the mysterious and insoluble problems of origin and existence.\r\n\r\nA cosmical history of the universe, resting upon facts as its basis, has,\r\nfrom the nature and limitations of its sphere, necessarily no connection\r\nwith the obscure domain embraced by a 'history of organisms',* if we\r\nunderstand the word 'history' in its broadest sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The 'history of plants', which Endlicher and Unger have\r\ndescribed in a most masterly manner ('Grundzuge der Botanik', 1843, s.\r\n449-468), I myself separated from the 'geography of plants' half a century\r\nago.  In the aphorisms appended to my 'Subterranean Flora', the following\r\npassage occurs:  \"Geognosia naturam animantem et inanimam vel, ut vocabulo\r\nminus apto, ex antiquitate saltem haud petito, utar, corpora vitur capita:\r\nGeographia oryctologica quam simpliciter Geognosiam vel Geologiam dicunt,\r\nvirque acutissimus Wernerus egregie digessit; Geographia zoologica, cujus\r\ndoctrinae fundamenta Zimmermannus et Treviranus jecerunt; et Geographic\r\nplantarum quam aequales nostri diu intactam reliquerunt.

Respecting the \"spontaneous motion.\" which is referred to in a\r\nsubsequent part of the text, see the remarkable passage in Aristotle, 'De\r\nCoelo,' ii., 2, p. 284, Bekker, where the distinction between animate and\r\ninanimate bodies is made to depend on the internal or external position of\r\nthe seat of the determining motion.  \"No movement,\" says the Stagirite,\r\n\"proceeds from the vegetable spirit, because plants are buried in a still\r\nsleep, from which nothing can arouse them\" (Aristotle, 'De Generat.\r\nAnimal.', v. i., p. 778, Bekker); and again, \"because plants have no desires\r\nwhich incite them to spontaneous motion.\"  (Arist., 'De Somno et Vigil'.,\r\ncap. i., p. 455, Bekker.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered, that the inorganic crust of the Earth\r\ncontains within it the same elements that enter into the structure of animal\r\nand vegetable organs.  A physical cosmography would therefore be incomplete\r\np 341\r\nif it were to omit a consideration of these forces, and of the substances\r\nwhich enter into solid and fluid combinations in organic tissues, under\r\nconditiions which, from our ignorance of their actual nature, we designate\r\nby the vague term of 'vital forces', and group into various systems in\r\naccordance with more or less perfectly conceived analogies.  The natural\r\ntendency of the human mind involuntarily prompts us to follow the physical\r\nphenomena of the Earth, through all their varied series, until we reach the\r\nfinal stage of the morphological evolution of vegetable forms, and the\r\nself-determining powers of motion in animal organisms.  And it is by these\r\nlinks that 'the geography of organic beings -- of plants and animals' -- is\r\nconnected with the delineation of the inorganic phenomena of our terrestrial\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nWithout entering on the difficult question of 'spontaneous motion', or, in\r\nother words, on the difference between vegetable and animal life, we would\r\nremark, that if nature had endowed us with microscopic powers of vision, and\r\nthe integuments of plants had been rendered perfectly transparent to our\r\neyes, the vegetable world would present a very different aspect from the\r\napparent immobility and repose in which it is now manifested to our senses.\r\nThe interior portion of the cellular structure of their organs is\r\nincessantly animated by the most varied currents, either rotating, ascending\r\nand descending, remifying, and ever changing their direction, as manifested\r\nin the motion of the granular mucus of marine plants (Naiades, Characeae,\r\nHydrocharidae), and in the hairs of phanerogamic land plants; in the\r\nmolecular motion first discovered by the illustrious botanist Robert Brown,\r\nand which may be traced in the ultimate portions of every molecule of\r\nmatter, even when separated from the organ; in the gyratory currents of the\r\nglobules of cambium ('cyclosis') circulating in their peculiar vessels; and,\r\nfinally, in the singularly articulated self-unrolling filamentous vessels in\r\nthe antheridia of the chara, and in the reproductive organs of liverworts\r\nand algae, in the structural conditions of which Meyen, unhappily too early\r\nlost to science, believed that he recognized an analogy with the spermatozoa\r\nof the animal kingdom.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[\"In certain parts, probably, of all plants, are found peculiar\r\nspiral filaments, having a striking resemblance to the spermatozoa of\r\nanimals.  They have been long known in the organs called the antheridia of\r\nmosses, Hepaticcae, and Characeae, and have more recently been discovered in\r\npeculiar cells on the germinal frond of ferns, and on the very young leaves\r\nof the buds of Phanerogamia.  They are found in peculiar cells, and when\r\nthese are placed in water they are torn by the filament, which commences an\r\nactive spiral motion.  The signification of these organs is at present quite\r\nunknown; they appear, from the researches of Nägeli, to resemble the cell\r\nmucilage, or proto-plasma, in composition, and are developed from it.\r\nSchleiden regards them as mere mucilaginous deposits, similar to those\r\nconnected with the circulation in cells, and he contends that the movement\r\nof these bodies in water is analogous to the molecular motion of small\r\nparticles of organic and inorganic substances, and depends on mechanical\r\ncauses.\" -- 'Outlines of Structural and Physiological Botany', by A.\r\nHenfrey, F.L.S., etc., 1846, p. 23.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf to these\r\np 342\r\nmanifold currents and gyratory movements we add the phenomena of endosmosis,\r\nnutrition, and growth, we shall have some idea of those forces which are\r\never active amid the apparent repose of vegetable life.\r\n\r\nSince I attempted in a former work, 'Ansichten der Natur' (Views of Nature),\r\nto delineate the universal diffusion of life over the whole surface of the\r\nEarth, in the distribution of organic forms, both with respect to elevation\r\nand depth, our knowledge of this branch of science has been most remarkably\r\nincreased by Ehrenberg's brilliant discovery \"on microscopic life in the\r\nocean, and in the ice of the polar regions\" -- a discovery based, not on\r\ndeductive conclusions, but on direct observation.  The sphere of vitality,\r\nwe might almost say, the horizon of life, has been expanded before our eyes.\r\n \"Not only in the polar regions is there an uninterrupted development of\r\nactive microscopic life, where larger animals can no longer exist, but we\r\nfind that the microscopic animals collected in the Antarctic expedition of\r\nCaptain James Ross exhibit a remarkable abundance of unknown and often most\r\nbeautiful forms.  Even in the residuum obtained from the melted ice,\r\nswimming about in round fragments in the latitude of 70 degrees 10', there\r\nwere found upward of fifty species of silicious-shelled Polygastria and\r\nCoscinodiscae with their green ovaries, and therefore living and able to\r\nresist the extreme severity of the cold.  In the Gulf of Erebus, sixty-eight\r\nsilicious-shelled Polygastria and Phytolitharia, and only one\r\ncalcareous-shelled Polythalamia, were brought up by lead sunk to a depth of\r\nfrom 1242 to 1620 feet.\"\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the oceanic microscopic forms hitherto discovered have\r\nbeen silicious-shelled, although the analysis of sea water does not yield\r\nsilica as the main constituent, and it can only be imagined to exist in it\r\nin a state of suspension.  It is not only at particular points in inland\r\nseas, or in the vicinity of the land, that the ocean is densely inhabited by\r\nliving atoms, invisible to the naked eye, but samples of\r\np 343\r\nwater taken up by Schayer on his return from Van Diemen's Land (south of the\r\nCape of Good Hope, in 57 degrees latitude, and under the tropics in the\r\nAtlantic) show that the ocean in its ordinary condition, without any\r\napparent discoloration, contains numerous microscopic moving organisms,\r\nwhich bear no resemblance to the swimming fragmentary silicious filaments of\r\nthe genus Chaetoceros, similar to the Oscillatoriae so common in our fresh\r\nwaters.  Some few Polygastria, which have been found mixed with sand and\r\nexcrements of penguins in Cockburn Island, appear to be spread over the\r\nwhole earth, while others seem to be peculiar to the polar regions.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Ehrenberg's treatise 'Ueber das kleinste Leben im Ocean',\r\nread before the Academy of Science at Berlin on the 9th of May, 1844.\r\n[Dr. J. Hooker found Diatomaceae in countless numbers between the parallels\r\nof 70 degrees and 80 degrees south, where they gave a color to the sea, and\r\nalso the icebergs floating in it.  The death of these bodies in the South\r\nArctic Ocean is producing a submarine deposit, consisting entirely of the\r\nsilicious particles of which the skeletons of these vegetables are composed.\r\n This deposit exists on the shores of Victoria Land and at the base of the\r\nvolcanic mountain Erebus.  Dr. Hooker accounted for the fact that the\r\nskeletons of Diatomaceae had been found in the  lava of volcanic mountains,\r\nby referring to these deposits at Mount Erebus, which lie in such a position\r\nas to render it quite possible that the skeletons of these vegetables should\r\npass into the lower fissures of the mountain, and then passing into the\r\nstream of lava, be thrown out, unacted upon by the heat to which they have\r\nbeen exposed.  See Dr. Hooker's Paper, read before the British Association\r\nat Oxford, July, 1847.] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus find from the most recent observations that animal life predominates\r\namid the eternal night of the depths of ocean, while vegetable life, which\r\nis so dependent on the periodic action of the solar rays, is most prevalent\r\non continents.  The mass of vegetation on the Earth very far exceeds that of\r\nanimal organisms; for what is the volume of all the large living Cetacea and\r\nPachydermata when compared with the thickly-crosded colossal trunks of\r\ntrees, of from eight to twelve feet in diameter, which fill the vast forests\r\ncovering the tropical region of South America, between the Orinoco, the\r\nAmazon, and the Rio de Madeira?  And although the character of different\r\nportions of the earth depends on the combination of external phenomena, as\r\nthe outlines of mountains -- the physiognomy of plants and animals -- the\r\nazure of the sky -- the forms of the clouds -- and the transparency of the\r\natmosphere -- it must still be admitted that the vegetable mantle with which\r\nthe earth is decked constitutes the main feature of the picture.  Animal\r\nforms are inferior in mass, and their powers of motion often withdraw them\r\nfrom our sight.  The\r\np 344\r\nvegetable kingdom, on the contrary, acts upon our imagination by its\r\ncontinued presence and by the magnitude of its forms; for the size of a tree\r\nindicates its age, and here alone age is associated with the expression of a\r\nconstantly renewed vigor.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Ansichten der Natur' (2te Ausgabe, 1826), bd. ii. s.\r\n21.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the animal kingdom (and this knowledge is also the result of Ehrenberg's\r\ndiscoveries), the form which we term microscopic occupy the largest space,\r\nin consequence of their rapid propagation.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On multiplication by spontaneous division of the\r\nmother-corpuscle and intercalation of new substance, see Ehrenberg 'Van den\r\njetzt lebenden Thierarten der Kreidebildung', in the 'Abhandl. der Berliner\r\nAkad. der Wiss.', 1839, s. 94.  The most powerful productive faculty in\r\nnature is that manifested in the Vorticellae.  Estimations of the greatest\r\npossible development of masses will be found in Chrenberg's great work 'Die\r\nInfusionsthierchen als volkommne Organismen', 1838, s. xiii., xix., and 244.\r\n \"The Milky Way of these organisms comprises the genera Monas, Vibrio,\r\nBacterium, and Bodo.\"  The universality of life is so profusely distributed\r\nthroughout the whole of nature, that the smaller Infusoria live as parasites\r\non the larger, and are themselves inhabited by others, s. 194, 211, and 512.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minutest of the Infusoria, the Monadidae, have a diameter which does not\r\nexceed 1/3000th of a line, and yet these silicious-shelled organisms form in\r\nhumid districts subterranean strata of many fathoms in depth.\r\n\r\nThe strong and beneficial influence exercised on the feelings of mankind by\r\nthe consideration of the diffusion of life, throughout the realms of nature\r\nis common to every zone, but the impression thus produced is most powerful\r\nin the equatorial regions, in the land of palms, bamboos, and arborescent\r\nferns, where the ground rises from the shore of seas rich in mollusca and\r\ncorals to the limits of perpetual snow.  The local distribution of plants\r\nembraces almost all heights and all depths.  Organic forms not only descend\r\ninto the interior of the earth, where the industry of the miner has laid\r\nopen extensive excavations and sprung deep shafts, but I have also found\r\nsnow-white stalactiitic columns encircled by the delicate web of an Usnea,\r\nin caves where meteoric water could alone penetrate through fissures.\r\nPodurellae penetrate into the icy crevices of the glaciers on Mount Rosa,\r\nthe Grindelwald, and the Upper Aar; the Chionaea nivalis (formerly known as\r\nProtococcus), exist in the polar snow as well as in that of our high\r\nmountains.  The redness assumed by the snow after lying on the ground for\r\nsoome time was known to Aristotle, and was probably observed by him on the\r\nmountains of Macedonia.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Aristot., 'Hist. Animal.', v. xix., p. 552, Bekk.\r\n\r\n\r\np 345\r\nWhile, on the loftiest summits of the Alps, only Lecideae, Parmeliae, and\r\nUmbilicariae cast their colored but scanty covering over the rocks, exposed\r\nby the melted snow, beautiful phanerogamic plants, as the Culcitium\r\nrufescens, Sida pinchinchensis, and Saxifraga Boussingaulti, are still found\r\nto flourish in the tropical region of the chain of the Andes, at an\r\nelevation of more than 15,000 feet.  Thermal springs contain small insects\r\n(Hydroporus thermalis), Gallionellae, Oscillatoria and Confervae, while\r\ntheir waters bathe the root-fibers of phanerogamic plants.  As air and water\r\nare aniimated at different temperatures by the presence of vital organisms,\r\nso likewise is the interior of the different portions of animal bodies.\r\nAnimalcules have been found in the blood of the frog and the salmon;\r\naccording to Nordmann, the fluids in the eyes of fishes are often filled\r\nwith a worm that lives by suction (Diplostomum), while in the gills of the\r\nbleak the same observer has discovered a remarkable double aniimalcule\r\n(Diplozoon paradoxum), having a cross-shaped form with two heads and two\r\ncaudal extremities.\r\n\r\nAlthough the existence of meteoric Infusoria is more than doubtful, it can\r\nnot be denied that, in the same manner as the pollen of the flowers of the\r\npine is observed every year to fall from the atmosphere, minute infusorial\r\nanimalcules may likewise be retained for a time in the strata of the air,\r\nafter  having been passively borne up by currents of aqueous vapor.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Ehrenberg, op. cit., s. xiv., p. 122 and 403.  The rapid\r\nmultiplication of microscopic organisms is, in the case of some (as, for\r\ninstance, in wheat-eels, wheel-animals, and water-bears or tardigrade\r\nanimalcules), accompanied by a remarkable tenacity of life.  They have been\r\nseen to come to life from a state of apparent death after being dried for\r\ntwenty-eight days in a vacuum with chloride of line and sulphuric acid, and\r\nafter being exposed to a heat of 248 degrees.  See the beautiful experiments\r\nof Doyere, in 'Mem. sur les Tardigrades et sur leur propriete de revenir a\r\nla vie', 1842, p. 119, 129, 131, 133.  Compare, also, Ehrenberg, s. 492-496,\r\non the revival of animalcules that had been dried during a space of many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis circumstance merits serious attention in reconsidering the old\r\ndiscussion respecting 'spontaneous generation',* and the\r\np 346\r\nmore so, as Ehrenberg, as I have already remarked,  has discovered that the\r\nnebulous dust or sand which mariners often encounter in the vicinity of the\r\nCape Verd Islands, and even at a distance of 380 geographical miles from the\r\nAfrican shore, contains the remains of eighteen species of silicious-shelled\r\npolygastric animalcules.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the supposed \"primitive transformation\" of organized or\r\nunorganized matter into plants and animals, see Ehrenberg, in Poggendorf's\r\n'Annalen der Physik', bd. xxiv., s. 1-48, and also his 'Infusionsthierchen',\r\ns. 121, 525, and Joh. Muller, 'Physiologie des Menschen' (4te Aufl., 1844),\r\nbd. i., s. 8-17.  It appears to me worthy of notice that one of the early\r\nfathers of the Church, St. Augustine, in treating of the question how\r\nislands may have been covered with new animals and plants after the flood,\r\nshows himself in no way disinclined to adope the view of the so-called\r\n\"spontaneous generation\" ('generatio aequivoca, spontanea aut primaria').\r\n\"If,\" says he, \"animals  have not been brought to remote islands by angels,\r\nor perhaps by inhabitants of continents addicted to the chase, they must\r\nhave been spontaneously produced upon the earth; although here the question\r\ncertainly arises, to what purpose, then, were animals of all kinds assembled\r\nin the ark?\"  \"Si e terra exort\" sunt (bestiae) secundum originem primam,\r\nquando dixit Deus\"  'Producat terra animam vivam!' multo clarius apparet,\r\nnon tam reparandorum animalium causa, quam figurandarum variarum gentium (?)\r\npropter ecclesiae sacramentumin arca fuisse omnia genera, si in insulis quo\r\ntransire non possent, multa animalia terra produxit.\"  Augustinus, 'De\r\nCivitate Dei', lib. xvi., cap. 7:  'Opera, ed. Monach. Ordinis S.\r\nBenedicti', t. vii., Venet., 1732, p. 422.  Two centuries before the tiime\r\nof the Bishop of Hippo, we find, by extracts from Trogus Pompeius, that the\r\n'generatio primaria' was brought forward in connection with the earliest\r\ndrying up of the ancient world, and of the high table-land of Asia,\r\nprecisely in the same manner as the terraces of Paradise, in the theory of\r\nthe great Linnaeus, and in the visionary hypotheses entertained in the\r\neighteenth century regarding the fabled Atlantis:  \"Quod si omnes quondam\r\nterrae submersae profundo fuerunt, profecto editissilimam quamque partem\r\ndecurrentibus aquis primum detectam; humillimo autem solo eandem aquam\r\ndiutissime immoratam, et quanto prior quaeque pars terrarum siccata sit,\r\ntanto prius animalia generare coepisse.  Porro Scythiam adeo editiorem\r\nomnibus terris esse ut cuncta flumina ibi nata in Maeotium, tum deinde in\r\nPonticum et Aegyptium mare decurrant.\" -- Justinus, lib. ii., cap. 1.  The\r\nerroneous supposition that the land of Scythia is an elevated table-land, is\r\nso ancient that we meet with it most clearly expressed in Hippocrates, 'De\r\nAere et Aquis', cap. 6, 96, Coray.  \"Scythia,\" says he, \"coonsists of high\r\nand naked plains, which, without being crowned with mountains, ascend higher\r\nand higher toward the north.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVital organisms, whose relations in space are comprised under the head of\r\nthe geography of plants and animals, may be considered either according to\r\nthe difference and relative numbers of the types (their arrangement into\r\ngenera and species), or according to the number of individuals of each\r\nspecies on a given area.  In the mode of life of plants as in that of\r\nanimals, an important difference is noticed; they either exist in an\r\nisolated state, or live in a social condition.  Those species of plants\r\nwhich I have termed 'social'* uniformly cover vast extents of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Humboldt, 'Aphorismi ex Physiologia Chemica Plantarum', in the\r\n'Flora Fribergensis Subterranea', 1793, p. 178.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong these we may reckon many of the marine Algae -- Cladoniae and mosses,\r\nwhich extend over the desert steppes of Northern Asia -- grasses, and cacti\r\ngrowing\r\np 347\r\ntogether like the pipes of an organ -- Avicennim and mangroves in the\r\ntropics -- and forests of Coniferae and of birches in the plains of the\r\nBaltic and in Siberia.  This mode of geographical distribution determines,\r\ntogether with the individual form of the vegetable world, the size and type\r\nof leaves and flowers, in fact, the principal physiognomy of the district,*\r\nits characteracter being but little, if at all, influenced by the\r\never-moving forms of animal life, which, by their beauty and diversity, so\r\npowerfully affect the feelings of man, whether by exciting the sensations of\r\nadmiration or horror.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *On the physiognomy of plants, see Humboldt, 'Anischten der\r\nNatur', bd. ii., s. 1-125.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgricultural nations increase artificially the predominance of social\r\nplants, and thus augment, in many parts of the temperate and northern zones,\r\nthe natural aspect of uniformity; and while their labors tend to the\r\nextirpation of some wild plants, they likewise lead to the cultivation of\r\nothers, which follow the colonist in his most distant migration.  The\r\nluxuriant zone of the tropics offers the strongest resistance to these\r\nchanges in the natural distribution of vegetable forms.\r\n\r\nObservers who in short periods of time have passed over vast tracts of land,\r\nand ascended lofty mountains, in which climates were ranged, as it were in\r\nstrata one above another, must have been early impressed by the regularity\r\nwith which vegetable forms are distributed.  The results yielded by their\r\nobservations furnished the rough materials for a science, to which no name\r\nhad as yet been given.  The same zones of regions of vegetation which, in\r\nthe sixteenth century, Cardinal Bembo, when a youth,*described on the\r\ndeclivity of Aetna, were observed on Mount Ararat by Tournefort.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Aetna Dialogus.'  'Opuscula', Basil., 1556, p. 53, 54.  A very\r\nbeautiful geography of the plants of Mount AEtna has recently been published\r\nby Philippi.  See 'Linnaea', 1832, s. 733.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe ingeniously compared the Alpine flora with the flora of plains situated\r\nin different latitudes, and was the first to observe the influence exercised\r\nin mountainous regions, on the distribution of plants by the elevation of\r\nthe ground above the level of the sea, and by the distance from the poles in\r\nflat countries.  Menzel, in an inedited work on the flora of Japan,\r\naccidentally made use of the term 'geography of plants'; and the same\r\nexpression occurs in the fanciful but graceful work of Bernardin de St.\r\nPierre, 'Etudes de la Nature'.  A scientific treatment of the subject began,\r\nhowever, only when the geography of plants was intimately associated with\r\nthe study of the distribution\r\np 348\r\nof heat over the surface of the earth, and when the arrangement of vegetable\r\nforms in natural families admitted of a numerical estimate being made of the\r\ndifferent forms which increase of decrease as we recede from the equator\r\ntoward the poles, and of  the relations in which, in diffrent parts of the\r\nearth, each family stood with reference to the whole mass of phanerogamic\r\nindigenous plants of the same region.  I consider it a happy circumstance\r\nthat, at the time during which I devoted my attention almost exclusively to\r\nbotanical pursuits, I was led by the aspect of the grand and strongly\r\ncharacterized features of tropical scenery to direct my investigations\r\ntoward these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe study of the geographical distribution of animals, regarding which\r\nBuffon first advanced general, and, in most instances, very correct views,\r\nhas been considerably aided in its advance by the progress made in modern\r\ntimes in the geography of plants.  The curves of the isothermal lines, and\r\nmore especially those of the isochimenal lines, correspond with the limits\r\nwhich are seldom passed by certain species of plants, and of animals which\r\ndo not wander far from their fixed habitation either with respect to\r\nelevation or latitude.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *[The following valuable remarks by Professor Forbes, on the\r\ncorrespondence existing between the distribution of existing faunas and\r\nfloras of the British Islands, and the geological changes that have affected\r\ntheir area, will be read with much interest; they have been copied, by the\r\nauthor's permission, from the 'Survey Report', p. 16:\r\n\"If the view I have put forward respecting the origin of the flora of the\r\nBritish mountains be true -- and every geological and botanical probability,\r\nso far as the are is concerned, favors it -- then must we endeavour to find\r\nsome more plausible cause than any yet shown for the presence of numerous\r\nspecies of plants, and of some animals, on the higher parts of Alpine ranges\r\nin Europe and Asia, specifically identical with  animals and plants\r\nindigenous in the regions very far north, and not found in the intermediate\r\nlowlands.  Tournefort first remarked and Humboldt, the great organizer of\r\nthe science of natural history geography, demonstrated, that zones of\r\nelevation on mountains correspond to parallels of latitude, the higher with\r\nthe more northern or southern, as the case might be.  It is well known that\r\nthis correspondence is recognized in the general 'facies' of the flora and\r\nfauna, dependent on generic identities.  But when announcing and\r\nillustrating the law that climatal zones of animal and vegetable life are\r\nmutually repeated or represented by elevation and latitude, naturalists have\r\nnot hitherto sufficiently (if at all) distinguished between the evidence of\r\nthat law, as exhibited by 'representative species' and by 'identical'.  In\r\nreality, the former essentially depend on the law, the latter being an\r\n'accident' not necessarily dependent upon it, and which has hitherto not\r\nbeen accounted for.  In the case of the Alpine flora of Britain, the\r\nevidence of the activity of the law, and the influence of the accident, are\r\ninseparable, the law being maintained by a transported flora, for the\r\ntransmission of which I have shown we can not account by an appeal to\r\nunquestionable geological events.  In the case of the Alps and Carpathians,\r\nand some other mountain ranges, we find the law maintained partly by a\r\nrepresentative flora, special in its region, i.e., by specific centers of\r\ntheir own, and partly by an assemblage more or less limited in the several\r\nranges of identical species, these latter in several cases so numerous that\r\nordinary modes of transportation now in action can no more account for their\r\npresence than they can for the presence of a Norwegian flora on the British\r\nmountains.  Now I am prepared to maintain that the same means which\r\nintroduced a sub-Arctic (now mmountain) flora into Britain, acting at the\r\nsame epoch, originated the identity, as far as it goes, of the Alpine floras\r\nof middle Europe and Central Asia; for, now that we know the vast area swept\r\nby the glacial sea, including almost the whole of Central and Northern\r\nEurope, and belted by land, since greatly uplifted, which then presented to\r\nthe water's edge those climatal lconditions for which a sub-Arctic flora --\r\ndestined to become Alpine -- was specially organized, the difficulty of\r\nderiving such a flora from its paarent north, and of diffusing it over the\r\nsnowy hills bounding this glacial ocean, vanishes, and the presence of\r\nidentical species at such distant pooints remain no longer a mystery.\r\nMoreover, when we consider that conditions during the epoch referred to, the\r\nundoubted evidences of Continental observers, on the boounds of Asia by Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison, in America by Mr. Lyell, Mr. Logan, Captain Bayfield,\r\nand others, and that the botanical (and zoological as well) region,\r\nessentially northern and Alpine, designated by Professor Schouw that 'of\r\nsaxifrages and mosses,' and first in his classification, exists now only on\r\nthe flanks of the great area which suffered such conditions; and that,\r\nthough similar conditions reappear, the relationship of Alpine and Arctic\r\nvegetation in the southern hemisphere, with that in the northern, is\r\nentirely maintained by 'representative', and not by identical species (the\r\ngeneral truth of my explanation of Alpine floras, including identical\r\nspecies, becomes so strong, that the view proposed acquires fair claims to\r\nbe ranked as a theory, and not considered merely a convenient or bold\r\nhypothesis.\"] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\np 349\r\nelk, for instance, lives in the Scandinavian peninsula, almost ten degrees\r\nfurther north than in the interior of Siberia, where the line of equal\r\nwinter temperature is so remarkably concave.  Plants migrate in the germ;\r\nand, in the case of many species, the seeds are furnished with organs\r\nadapting them to be conveyed to a distace through the air.  When once they\r\nhave taken root, they become dependent on the soil and on the strata of air\r\nsurrounding them.  Animals, on the contrary, can at pleasure migrate from\r\nthe equator toward the poles; and this they can more especially doo where\r\nthe isothermal lines are much inflected, and where hot summers succeed a\r\ngreat degree of winter cold.  The royal tiger, which in no respect differs\r\nfrom the Bengal species, penetrates every summer into\r\np 350\r\nthe north of Asia as far as the latitudes of Berlin and Hamburg, a fact of\r\nwhich Ehrenberg and myself have spoken in other works.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Ehrenberg, in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles', t. xxi.,\r\np. 387, 412; Humboldt, 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 339-342, and t. iii., p.\r\n96-101.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grouping or association of diffrent vegetable species, to which we are\r\naccustomed to apply the term 'Floras', do not appear to me, from what I have\r\nobserved in different portions of the earth's surface, to manifest such a\r\npredominance of individual families as to justify us in marking the\r\ngeographical distinctions between the regions of the Umbellatae, of the\r\nSolidaginae, of the Labiatae, or the Scitamineae.  With reference to this\r\nsubject, my views differ from those of several of my friends, who rank among\r\nthe most distinguished of the botanists of Germany.  The character of the\r\nfloras of the elevated plateaux of Mexico, New Granada, and Quito, of\r\nEuropean Russia, and of Northern Asia, consists, in my opinion, not so much\r\nin the relatively larger number of the species presented by one or two\r\nnatural families, as in the more complicated relations of the coexistence of\r\nmany families, and in the relative numerical value of their species.  The\r\nGramineae and the Cyperaceae undoubtedly predominate in meadow lands and\r\nstppes, as do Coniferae, Cupuliferae, and Betulineae in our northern woods;\r\nbut this predominance of certain forms is only apparent, and owing to the\r\naspect imparted by the social plants.  The north of Europe, and that portion\r\nof Siberia which is situated to the north of the Altai Mountains, have no\r\ngreater right to the appellation of a region of Gramineae and Coniferae than\r\nhave the boundless llanos between the Orinoco and the mountain chain of\r\nCaraccas, or the pine forests of Mexico.  It is the coexistence of forms\r\nwhich may partially replace each other, and their relative numbers and\r\nassociation, which give rise either to the general impression of luxuriance\r\nand diversity, or of poverty and uniformity in the contemplation of the\r\nvegetable world.\r\n\r\nIn this fragmentary sketch of the phenomena of organization, I have ascended\r\nfrom the simplest cellI -- the first manifestation of life -- progressively\r\nto higher structures.  \"The\r\np 351\r\nassociation of mucous granules constitutes a definitely-formed cytoblase,\r\naround which a vesicular membrane forms ia closed well,\" this cell being\r\neither produced from another pre-existing cell,** or being due to a cellular\r\nformation, which, as in the case of the fermentation-fungus, is concealed in\r\nthe obscurity of some unknown chemical process.***\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Schleiden, 'Ueber die Entwicklungsweise der Pflanzenzellen', in\r\nMuller's 'Archiv fur Anatomie und Physiologie', 1838, s. 137-176; also his\r\n'Grundzuge der wissenschaftlichen Botanik', th. i., s. 191, and th. ii., s\r\n11.

It is by\r\nthese relations that the obscure and much-contested problem of the\r\npossibility of one common descent enters into the sphere embraced by a\r\ngeneral physical cosmography.  The investigation of this problem will impart\r\na nobler, and, if I may so express myself, more purely human interest to the\r\nclosing pages of this section of my work.\r\n\r\nThe vast domain of language, in whose varied structure we see mysteriously\r\nreflected the destinies of nations, is most intimately associated with the\r\naffinity of races; and what even slight differences of races may effect is\r\nstrikingly manifested in the history of the Hellenic nations in the zenith\r\nof their intellectual cultivation.  The most important questions of the\r\ncivilization of mankind are connected with the ideas of races,\r\np 352\r\ncommunity of language, and adherence to one original direction of the\r\nintellectual and moral faculties.\r\n\r\nAs long as attention was directed solely to the extremes in varieties of\r\ncolor and of form, and to the vividness of the first impression of the\r\nsenses, the observer was naturally disposed to regard races rather as\r\noriginally different species than as mere varieties.  The permanence of\r\ncertain types* in the midst of the most hostile influences, especially of\r\nclimate, appeared to favor such a view, notwithstanding the shortness of the\r\ninterval of time from which the historical evidence was derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Tacitus, in his speculations on the inhabitants of Britain\r\n('Agricola', cap. ii.), distinguishes with much judgment between that which\r\nmay be owing to the local climatic relations, and that which, in the\r\nimmigrating races, may be owing to the unchangeable influence of a\r\nhereditary and transmitted type.  \"Britanniam qui mortales initio coluerunt,\r\n indigenae an advecti, ut inter barbaros, parum coompertum.

The greater part of\r\nthe terrestrial animals and flowering plants now inhabiting the British\r\nislands are members of specific centers beyond their area, and have migrated\r\nto it over continuous land before, during, or after the glacial epoch.  5.\r\nThe climatal conditions of the area under discussion, and north, east, and\r\nwest of it, were severer during the glacial epoch, when a great part of the\r\nspace now occupied by the British isles was under water, than they are now\r\nor were before; but there is good reason to believe that, so far from those\r\nconditions having continued severe, or having gradually diminished in\r\nseverity southward of Britain, the cold region of the glacial epoch came\r\ndirectly into contact with a region of more southern and thermal character\r\nthan that in which the most southern beds of glacial drift are now to be met\r\nwith.  6.  This state of things did not materially differ from that now\r\nexisting, under corresponding latitudes, in the North American, Atlantic,\r\nand Arctic seas, and on their bounding shores.  7.  The Alpine floras of\r\nEurope and Asia, so far as they are identical with the flora of the Arctic\r\nand sub-Arctic zones of the Old World, are fragments of a flora which was\r\ndiffused from the north, either by means of transport not now in action on\r\nthe temperate coasts of Europe, or over continuous land which no longer\r\nexists.  The deep sea fauna is in like manner a fragment of the general\r\nglacial fauna.  8.  The floras of the islands of the Atlantic region,\r\nbetween the Gulf-weed Bank and the Old World, are fragments of the Great\r\nMediterranean flora, anciently diffused over a land consistuted out of the\r\nupheaval and never again subjerged bed of the (shallow) Meiocene Sea.  This\r\ngreat flora, in the epoch anterior to, and probably, in part, during the\r\nglacial period, had a greater extension northward than it now presents.  9.\r\nThe termination of the glacial epoch in Europe was marked by a recession of\r\nan Arctic fauna and flora northward, and of a fauna and flora of the\r\nMediterranean type southward; and in the interspace thus produced there\r\nappeared on land the Germanic fauna and flora, and in the sea that fauna\r\ntermed Celtic.  10.  The causes which thus preceded the appearance of a new\r\nassemblage of organized beings were the destruction of many species of\r\nanimals, and probably also of plants, either forms of extremely local\r\ndistribution, or such as were not capable of enduring many changes of\r\nconditions -- species, in short, with very limited capacity for horizontal\r\nor vertical diffusion.  11.  All the changes before, during, and after the\r\nglacial epoch appear to have been gradual, and not sudden, so that no marked\r\nline of demarkation can be drawn between the creatures inhabiting the same\r\nelement and the same locality during two proximate periods.\"] -- Tr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different races of mankind are forms of one sole species, by the union\r\nof two of whose members descendants are propagated.  They are not different\r\nspecies of a genus, since in that case their hybrid descendants would remain\r\nunfruitful.  But whether the human races have descended from several\r\nprimitive races of men, or from one alone, is a question that can not be\r\ndetermined from experience.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Joh. Muller, 'Physiologie des Menschen', bd. ii., s. 768.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographical investigations regarding the ancient 'seat', the so-called\r\n'cradle of the human race', are not devoid of a mythical\r\np 355\r\ncharacter.  \"We do not know,\" says Wilhelm von Humboldt, in an unpublished\r\nwork 'On the Varieties of Languages and Nations', \"either from history or\r\nfrom authentic tradition, any period of time in which the human race has not\r\nbeen divided into social groups.  Whether the gregarious condition was\r\noriginal, or of subsequent occurrence, we have no historic evidence to show.\r\n The separate mythical relations found to exist independently of one another\r\nin different parts of the earth, appear to refute the first hypothesis, and\r\nconcur in ascribing the generation of the whole human race to the union of\r\none pair.  The general prevalence of this myth has cause it to be regarded\r\nas a traditionary record transmitted from the primitive man to his\r\ndescendants.  But this very circumstance seems rather to prove that it has\r\nno historical foundation, but has simply arisen from an identity in the mode\r\nof  intellectual conception, which has every where led man to adopt the same\r\nconclusion regarding identical phenomena; in the same manner as many myths\r\nhave doubtlessly arisen, not from any historical connection existing between\r\nthem, but rather from an identity in human thought and imagination.  Another\r\nevidence in favor of the purely mythical nature of this belief is afforded\r\nby the fact that the first origin of mankind -- a phenomenon which is wholly\r\nbeyond the sphere of experience -- is explained in perfect conformity with\r\nexisting views, being considered on the principle of the colonization of\r\nsome desert island or remote mountainous valley at a period when mankind had\r\nalready existed for thousands of years.  It is in vain that we direct our\r\nthoughts to the solution of the great problem of the first origin, since man\r\nis too intimately associated with his own race and with the relations of\r\ntime to conceive of the existence of an individual independently of a\r\npreceding generation and age.  A solution of those difficult  questions,\r\nwhich can not be determined by inductive reasoning or by experience --\r\nwhether the belief in this presumed traditional condition be actually based\r\non historical evidence, or whether mankind inhabited the earth in gregarious\r\nassociations from the origin of the race -- can not, therefore, be\r\ndetermined from philological data, and yet its elucidation ought not to be\r\nsought from other sources.\"\r\n\r\nThe distribution of mankind is therefore only a distribution into\r\n'varieties', which are commonly designated by the somewhat indefinite term\r\n'races'.  As in the vegetable kingdom, and in the natural history of birds\r\nand fishes, a classification into many small families is based on a surer\r\nfoundation than\r\np 356\r\nwhere large sections are separated into a few but large divisions; so it\r\nalso appears to me, that in the determination of races a preference should\r\nbe given to the establishment of small families of nations.  Whether we\r\nadopt the old classification of my master, Blumenbach, and admit 'five'\r\nraces (the Caucasian, Mongolian, American, Ethiopian, and Malayan), or that\r\nof Prichard, into 'seven races'* (the Iranian, Turanian, American,\r\nHottentots and Bushmen, Negroes, Papuas, and Alfourons), we fail to\r\nrecognize any typical sharpness of definition, or any general or\r\nwell-established principle in the division of these groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Prichard, op. cit., vol. i., p. 247.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extremes of form and color are certainly separated, but without regard\r\nto the races, which can not be included in any of these classes, and which\r\nhave been alternately termed Scythian and Allophyllic.  Iranian is certainly\r\na less objectionable term for the European nations than Caucasian; but it\r\nmay be maintained generally that geographical denominations are very vague\r\nwhen used to express the points of departure of races, more especially where\r\nthe country which has given its name to the race, as, for instance, Turan\r\n(Mawerannahr), has been inhabited at different periods* by Indo-Germanic and\r\nFinnish, and not by Mongolian tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The late arrival of the Turkish and Mongolian tribes on the\r\nOxus and on the Kirghis Steppes is opposed to the hypothesis of Niebuhr,\r\naccording to which the Scythians of Herodotus and Hippocrates were\r\nMongolians.  It seems far more probable that the Scythians (Scoloti) should\r\nbe referred to the Indo-Germanic Massagetae (Alani).  The Mongolian, true\r\nTartars (the latter term was afterward falsely given to purely Turkish\r\ntribes in Russia and Siberia), were settled, at that period, far in the\r\neastern part of Asia.  See my 'Asie Centrale', t. i., p. 239, 400; 'Examen\r\nCritique de l'Histoire de la Geogr.', th. ii., p. 320.  A distinguished\r\nphilologist, Professor Buschmann, calls attention to the circumstance that\r\nthe poet Firdousi, in his half-mythical prefatory remarks in the\r\n'Schahnameh', mentions \"a fortress of the Alani\" on the sea-shore, in which\r\nSelm took refuge, this prince being the eldest son of the King Feridun, who\r\nin all probability lived two hundred years before Cyrus.  The Kirghis of the\r\nScythian steppe were originally a Finnish tribe; their three hordes probably\r\nconstitute in the present day the most numerous nomadic nation, and their\r\ntribe dwelt, in the sixteenth century, in the same steppe in which I have\r\nmyself seen them.  The Byzantine Menander (p. 380-382, ed. Nieb.) expressly\r\nstates that the Chacan of the Turks (Thu-Khiu), in 569, made a present of a\r\nKirghis slave to Zemarchus, the embassador of ustinish II.; he terms her a\r\n[Greek word]; and we find in Abulgasi ('Historia Mongolorum et Tatarorum')\r\nthat the Kirghis are called Kirkiz.  Similarity of manners, where the nature\r\nof the country determines the principal characteristics, is a very uncertain\r\nevidence of identity of race.  The life of the steppes produces among the\r\nTurks (Ti Tukiu), the Baschkirs (Fins), the Kirghis, the Torgodi and\r\nDsungari (Mongolians), the same habits of nomadic life, and the same use of\r\nfelt tents, carried on wagons and pitched among herds of cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\np 357\r\nLanguages, as intellectual creations of man, and as closely interwoven with\r\nthe development of mind, are, independently of the 'national' form which\r\nthey exhibit, of the greatest importance in the recognition of similarities\r\nor differences in races.  This importance is especially owing to the clew\r\nwhich a community of descent affords in treading that mysterious labyrinth\r\nin which the connection of physical powers and intellectual forces manifests\r\nitself in a thousand different forms.  The brilliant progress made within\r\nthe last half century, in Germany, in philosophical philology, has greatly\r\nfacilitated our investigations into the 'national' character* of languages\r\nand the influence exercised by descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Wilhelm von Humboldt, 'Ueber die Verschiedenheit der\r\nmenschlichen Sprachbaues', in his great work 'Ueber die Kawi-Sprache auf der\r\nInsel Java', bd. i., s. xxi., xlviii., and ccxiv.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut here, as in all domains of ideal speculation, the dangers of deception\r\nare closely linked to the rich and certain profit to be derived.\r\n\r\nPositive ethnographical studies, based on a thorough knowledge of history,\r\nteach us that much caution should be applied in entering into these\r\ncomparisons of nations, and of the languages employed by them at certain\r\nepochs.  Subjection, long association, the influence of a foreign religion,\r\nthe blending of races, even when only including a small number of the more\r\ninfluential and cultivated of the immigrating tribes, have produced, in both\r\ncontinents, similarly recurring phenomena; as, for instance, in introducing\r\ntotally different families of languages among one and the same race, and\r\nidioms, having one common root, among nations of the most different origin.\r\nGreat Asiatic conquerors have exercised the most powerful influence on\r\nphenomena of this kind.\r\n\r\nBut language is a part and parcel of the history of the development of mind;\r\nand however happily the human intellect, under the most dissimilar physical\r\nconditions, may unfettered pursue a self-chosen track, and strive to free\r\nitself from the dominion of terrestrial influences, this emancipation is\r\nnever perfect.  There ever remains, in the natural capacities of the mind, a\r\ntrace of something that has been derived from the influences of race or of\r\nclimate, whether they be associated with a land gladdened by cloudless azure\r\nskies, or with the vapory atmosphere of an insular region.  As, therefore,\r\nrichness and grace of language are unfolded from the most luxuriant\r\np 358\r\ndepths of thought, we have been unwilling wholly to disregard the bond which\r\nso closely links together the physical world with the sphere of intellect\r\nand of the feelings by depriving this general picture of nature of those\r\nbrighter lights and tints which may be borrowed from considerations, however\r\nslightly indicated, of the relations existing between races and languages.\r\n\r\nWhile we maintain the unity of the human species, we at the same time repel\r\nthe depressing assumption of superior and inferior races of men.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *The very cheerless, and, in recent times, too often discussed\r\ndoctrine of the unequal rights of men to freedom, and of slavery as an\r\ninstitution in conformity with nature, is unhappily found most\r\nsystematically developed in Aristotle's 'Politica', i., 3, 5, 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are nations more susceptible of cultivation, more highly civilized,\r\nmore enobled by mental cultivation than others, but none in themselves\r\nnobler than others.  All are in like degree designed for freedom; a freedom\r\nwhich, in the ruder conditions of society, belongs only to the individual,\r\nbut which, in social states enjoying political institutions, appertains as a\r\nright to the whole body of the community.  \"If we would indicate an idea\r\nwhich, throughout the whole course of history, has ever more and more widely\r\nextended its empire, or which, more than any other, testifies to the\r\nmuch-contested and still more decidedly misunderstood perfectibility of the\r\nwhole human race, it is that of establishing our common humanity -- of\r\nstriving to remove the barriers which prejudice and limited views of every\r\nkind have erected among men, and to treat all mankind, without reference to\r\nreligion, nation, or color, as one fraternity, one great community, fitted\r\nfor the attainment of one object, the unrestrained development of the\r\nphysical powers.  This is the ultimate and highest aim of society, identical\r\nwith the direction implanted by nature in the mind of man toward the\r\nindefinite extension of his existence.  He regards the earth in all its\r\nlimits, and the heavens as far as his eye can scan their bright and starry\r\ndepths, as inwardly his own, given to him as the objects of his\r\ncontemplation, and as a field for the development of his energies.  Even the\r\nchild longs to pass the hills or the seas which inclose his narrow home;\r\nyet, when his eager steps have borne him beyond those limits, he pines, like\r\nthe plant, for his native soil; and it is by this touching and beautiful\r\nattribute of man -- this longing for that which is unknown, and this fond\r\nremembrance of that which is lost -- that he is spared from an exclusive\r\nattachment to the present.\r\np 359\r\nThus deeply rooted in the innermost nature of man, and even enjoined upon\r\nhim by his highest tendencies, the recognition of the bond of humanity\r\nbecomes one of the noblest leading principles in the history of mankind.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *Wilhelm von Humboldt, 'Ueber die Kawi-Sprache', bd. iii., s.\r\n426.  I subjoin the following extract from this work:  \"The impetuous\r\nconquests of Alexander, the more politic and premeditated extension of\r\nterritory made by the Romans, the wild and cruel incursions of the Mexicans,\r\nand the despotic acquisitions of the incas, have in both hemispheres\r\ncontributed to put an end to the separate existence of many tribes as\r\nindependent nations, and tended at the same time to establish more extended\r\ninternational amalgamation.  Men of great and strong minds, as well as whole\r\nnations, acted under the influence of one idea, the purity of which was,\r\nhowever, utterly unknown to them.  It was Christianity which first\r\npromulgated the truth of its exalted charity, although the seed sown yielded\r\nbut a slow and scanty harvest.  Before the religion of Christ manifested its\r\nform, its existence was only revealed by a faint foreshadowing presentiment.\r\n In recent times, the idea of civilization has acquired additional\r\nintensity, and has given rise to a desire of extending more widely the\r\nrelations of national intercourse and of intellectual cultivation; even\r\nselfishness begins to learn that by such a course its interests will be\r\nbetter served than by violent and forced isolation.  Language more than any\r\nother attribute of mankind, binds together the whole human race.  By its\r\nidiomatic properties it certainly seems to separate nations, but the\r\nreciprocal understanding of foreign languages connects men together on the\r\nother hand without injuring individual national characteristics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these words, which draw their charm from the depths of feeling, let a\r\nbrother be permitted to close this general description of the natural\r\nphenomena of the universe.  From the remotest nebulae and from the revolving\r\ndouble stars, we have descended to the minutest organisms of animal\r\ncreation, whether manifested in the depths of ocean or on the surface of our\r\nglobe, and to the delicate vegetable germs which clothe the naked declivity\r\nof the ice-crowned mountain summit; and here we have been able to arrange\r\nthese phenomena according to partially known laws; but other laws of a more\r\nmysterious nature rule the higher spheres of the organic world, in which is\r\ncomprised the human species in all its varied conformation, its creative\r\nintellectual power, and the languages to which it has given existence.  A\r\nphysical delineation of nature terminates at the point where the sphere of\r\nintellect begins, and a new world of mind is opened to our view.  It marks\r\nthe limit, but does not pass it.\r\n\r\np 360 is blank\r\n\r\np 361\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESENT EDITION.  MARCH, 1849.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nGIGANTIC BIRDS OF NEW ZEALAND. -- Vol. i., p. 287.\r\nAn extensive and highly interesting collection of bones, referrible to\r\nseveral species of the 'Moa' (Dinornis of Owen), and to three or four other\r\ngenera of birds, formed by Mr. Walter Mantell, of Wellington, New Zealand,\r\nhas recently arrived in England, and is now deposited in the British Museum.\r\n This series consists of between 700 and 800 speciments, belonging to\r\ndifferent parts of the skeletons of many individuals of various sizes and\r\nages.  Some of the largest vertebrae, tibiae, and femora equal in magnitude\r\nthe most gigantic previously known, while others are not larger than the\r\ncorresponding bones of the living apteryx.  Among these relics are the\r\n'skulls' and 'mandibles'  of two genera, the 'Dinornis' and 'Palapteryx';\r\nand of an extinct genus, 'Notornis', allied to the 'Rallidae'; and the\r\nmandibles of a species of 'Nestor', a genus of nocturnal owl-like parrots,\r\nof which only two living species are known.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *See Professor Owen's Memoir on these fossil remains, in\r\n'Zoological Transactions', 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese osseous remains are in a very different state of preservation from any\r\npreviously received from New Zealand; they are light and porous, and of a\r\nlight fawn-color; the most delicate processes are entire, and the\r\narticulating surfaces smooth and uninjured; 'fragments of egg-shells', and\r\neven the bony rings of the trachea and air tubes, are preserved'.\r\n\r\nThe bones were dug up by Mr. Walter Mantell from a bed of marly sand,\r\ncontaining magnetic iron, crystals of hornblende and augite, and the\r\ndetritus of augitic rocks and earthy volcanic tuff.  The sand had filled up\r\nall the cavities and cancelli, but was in no instance consolidated or\r\naggregated together; it was, therefore, easily removed by a soft brush, and\r\nthe bones perfectly cleared without injury.\r\n\r\nThe spot whence these precious relics of the colossal birds that once\r\ninhabited the islands of New Zealand were obtained, is a flat tract of land,\r\nnear the embouchure of a river, named Waingongoro, not far from Wanganui,\r\nwhich has its rise in the volcanic regions of Mount Egmont.  The natives\r\naffirm that this level tract was one of the places first dwelt upon by their\r\nremote ancestors; and this tradition is corroborated by the existence of\r\nnumerous heaps and pits of ashes and charred bones indicating ancient fires,\r\nlong burning on the same spot.  In these fire-heaps Mr. Mantell found burned\r\nbones of 'men, moas', and 'dogs'.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of egg-shells, imbedded in the ossiferous deposits, had\r\nescaped the notice of all previous naturalists.  They are, unfortunately,\r\nvery small portions, the largest being only four inches long, but they\r\nafford a chord by which to estimate the size of the original.  Mr. Mantell\r\nobserves that the egg of the Moa must have been so large that a hat would\r\nform a good egg-cup for it.  These relics evidently belong to two or more\r\nspecies, perhaps genera.  In some examples the external\r\np 362\r\nsurface is smooth; in others it is marked with short intercepted linear\r\ngrooves, resembling the eggs of some of the Struthiouidae, but distinct from\r\nall known recent types.  In this valuable collection only one bone of a\r\nmammal has been detected, namely, 'the femur of a dog'.\r\n\r\nAn interesting memoir on the probable geological position and age of the\r\nornithic bone deposits of New Zealand, by Dr. Mantell, based on the\r\nobservations of his enterprising son, it published in the Quarterly Journal\r\nof the Geological Society of London (1848).  It appears that in many\r\ninstances the bones are imbedded in sand and clay, which lie beneath a thick\r\ndeposit of volcanic detritus, and rest on an argillaceous stratum abounding\r\nin marine shells.  The specimens found in the rivers and streams have been\r\nwashed out of their banks by the currents which now flow through channels\r\nfrom ten to thirty feet deep, formed in the more ancient alluvial soil.  Dr.\r\nMantell concludes that the islands of New Zealand were densely peopled at a\r\nperiod geologically recent, though historically remote, by tribes of\r\ngigantic brevi-pennate birds allied to the ostrich tribe, all, or almost\r\nall, of species and genera now extinct; and that, subsequently to the\r\nformation of the most ancient ornithic deposit, the sea-coast has been\r\nelevated from fifty to one hundred feet above its original level; hence the\r\nterraces of shingle and loam which now skirt the maritime districts.  The\r\nexisting rivers and mountain torrents flow in deep gulleys which they have\r\neroded in the course of centuries in these pleistocene strata, in like\r\nmanner as the river courses of Auvergne, in Central France, are excavated in\r\nthe mammiferous tertiary deposits of that country.  The last of the gigantic\r\nbirds were probably exterminated, like the dodo, by human agency:  some\r\nsmall species allied to the apteryx may possibly be met with in the\r\nunexplored parts of the middle island.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DODO. -- A most valuable and highly interesting history of the dodo and\r\nits kindred* has recently appeared in which the history, affinities, and\r\nosteology of the 'Dodo, Solitaire', and other extinct birds of the islands\r\nMauritius, Rodriguez, and Bourbon are admirably elucidated by H. G.\r\nStrickland (of Oxford), and Dr. G. A. Melville.\r\n\r\n\r\n[footnote]  *'The Dodo and its Kindred'.  By Messrs. Strickland and\r\nMelville.  1 vol. 4to. with numerous plates.

We would earnestly recommend the\r\nreader interested in the most perfect history that has ever appeared, of the\r\nextinction of a race of large animals, of which thousands existed but three\r\ncenturies ago, to refer to the original work.
