To possess a cabinet\r\nwell stored, and to know by what name each described individual which\r\nit contains should be distinguished, will not satisfy the love that\r\nis already grown strong in you for my favourite pursuit; and you now\r\nanticipate with a laudable eagerness, the discoveries that you may\r\nmake respecting the history and economy of this most interesting\r\ndepartment of the works of our Creator. I hail with joy this\r\nintention to emulate the bright example, and to tread in the hallowed\r\nsteps of Swammerdam, Leeuwenhoek, Redi, Malpighi, Vallisnieri, Ray,\r\nLister, Reaumur, De Geer, Lyonnet, Bonnet, the Hubers, &c.; and I am\r\nconfident that a man of your abilities, discernment, and observation\r\nwill contribute, in no small degree, to the treasures already poured\r\ninto the general fund by these your illustrious predecessors.\r\n\r\nI feel not a little flattered when you inform me that the details\r\ncontained in my late letters relative to this subject, have\r\nstimulated you to this noble resolution.--Assure yourself, I shall\r\nthink no labour lost, that has been the means of winning over to the\r\nscience I love, the exertions of a mind like yours.\r\n\r\nBut if the facts already related, however extraordinary, have had\r\npower to produce such an effect upon you, what will be the momentum,\r\nwhen I lay before you more at large, as I next purpose, the most\r\nstriking particulars of the proceedings of insects in society,\r\nand show the almost incredibly wonderful results of the combined\r\ninstincts and labours of these minute beings? In comparison with\r\nthese, all that is the fruit of solitary efforts, though some of\r\nthem sufficiently marvellous, appear trifling and insignificant: as\r\nthe works of man himself, when they are the produce of the industry\r\nand genius of only one, or a few individuals, though they might be\r\nregarded with admiration by a being who had seen nothing similar\r\nbefore, yet when contrasted with those to which the union of these\r\nqualities in large bodies has given birth, sink into nothing, and\r\nseem unworthy of attention. Who would think a hut extraordinary by\r\nthe side of a stately palace, or a small village when in the vicinity\r\nof a populous and magnificent city?\r\n\r\nInsects in society may be viewed under several lights, and their\r\nassociations are for various purposes and of different durations.\r\n\r\nThere are societies the object of which is mutual defence; while that\r\nof others is the propagation of the species. Some form marauding\r\nparties, and associate for prey and plunder;--others meet, as it\r\nshould seem, under certain circumstances, merely for the sake of\r\ncompany;--again, others are brought together by accidental causes,\r\nand disperse when these cease to operate;--and finally, others, which\r\nmay be said to form proper societies, are associated for the nurture\r\nof their young, and, by the union of their labours and instincts, for\r\nmutual society, help, and comfort, in erecting or repairing their\r\ncommon habitation, in collecting provisions, and in defending their\r\nfortress when attacked.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the _duration_ of the societies of insects, some\r\nlast only during their first or larva state; and are occasionally\r\neven restricted to its earliest period;--some again only associate\r\nin their perfect or imago state; while with others, the _proper_\r\nsocieties for instance, the association is for life. But if I divide\r\nsocieties of insects into perfect and imperfect, it will, I think,\r\nenable me to give you a clearer and better view of the subject. By\r\n_perfect_ societies I mean those that are associated in all their\r\nstates, live in a common habitation, and unite their labours to\r\npromote a common object;--and by _imperfect_ societies, those that\r\nare either associated during part of their existence only, or else do\r\nnot dwell in a common habitation, nor unite their labours to promote\r\na common object. In the present letter I shall confine myself to\r\ngiving you some account of _imperfect_ societies.\r\n\r\nImperfect societies may be considered as of five\r\ndescriptions:--associations for the sake of company\r\nonly--associations of males during the season for\r\npairing--associations formed for the purpose of travelling or\r\nemigrating together--associations for feeding together--and\r\nassociations that undertake some common work.\r\n\r\nThe first of these associations consists chiefly of insects in their\r\nperfect state. The little beetles called whirlwigs (_Gyrinus_),--which\r\nmay be seen clustering in groups under warm banks in every river and\r\nevery pool, and wheeling round and round with great velocity; at your\r\napproach dispersing and diving under water, but as soon as you retire\r\nresuming their accustomed movements,--seem to be under the influence of\r\nthe social principle, and to form their assemblies for no other purpose\r\nthan to enjoy together, in the sunbeam, the mazy dance. Impelled by\r\nthe same feeling, in the very depth of winter, even when the earth is\r\ncovered with snow, the tribes of _Tipulariæ_ (usually, but improperly,\r\ncalled gnats) assemble in sheltered situations at midday, when the sun\r\nshines, and form themselves into choirs, that alternately rise and fall\r\nwith rapid evolutions[1]. To see these little aëry beings apparently\r\nso full of joy and life, and feeling the entire force of the social\r\nprinciple in that dreary season, when the whole animal creation appears\r\nto suffer, and the rest of the insect tribes are torpid, always conveys\r\nto my mind the most agreeable sensations. These little creatures may\r\nalways be seen at all seasons amusing themselves with these choral\r\ndances; which Mr. Wordsworth, in one of his poems[2], has alluded to in\r\nthe following beautiful lines:\r\n\r\n          \"Nor wanting here to entertain the thought,\r\n           Creatures that in communities exist,\r\n           Less, as might seem, for general guardianship\r\n           Or through dependance upon mutual aid,\r\n           Than by participation of delight,\r\n           And a strict love of fellowship combined.\r\n           What other spirit can it be that prompts\r\n           The gilded summer flies to mix and weave\r\n           Their sports together in the solar beam,\r\n           Or in the gloom and twilight hum their joy?\"\r\n\r\nAnother association is that of males during the season of pairing.\r\nOf this nature seems to be that of the cockchafer and fernchafer\r\n(_Melolontha vulgaris_ and _Amphimalla solstitialis_), which, at\r\ncertain periods of the year and hours of the day, hover over the\r\nsummits of the trees and hedges like swarms of bees, affording,\r\nwhen they alight on the ground, a grateful food to cats, pigs,\r\nand poultry. The males of another root-devouring beetle (_Hoplia\r\nargentea_) assemble by myriads before noon in the meadows, when in\r\nthese infinite hosts you will not find even one female[3]. After\r\nnoon the congregation is dissolved, and not a single individual\r\nis to be seen in the air[4]: while those of _M. vulgaris_ and _A.\r\nsolstitialis_ are on the wing only in the evening.\r\n\r\nAt the same time of the day some of the short-lived Ephemeræ assemble\r\nin numerous troops, and keep rising and falling alternately in the\r\nair, so as to exhibit a very amusing scene. Many of these also are\r\nmales. They continue this dance from about an hour before sun-set,\r\ntill the dew becomes too heavy or too cold for them. In the beginning\r\nof September, for two successive years, I was so fortunate as to\r\nwitness a spectacle of this kind, which afforded me a more sublime\r\ngratification than any work or exhibition of art has power to\r\ncommunicate.--The first was in 1811:--taking an evening walk near\r\nmy house, when the sun declining fast towards the horizon shone\r\nforth without a cloud, the whole atmosphere over and near the stream\r\nswarmed with infinite myriads of Ephemeræ and little gnats of the\r\ngenus _Chironomus_, which in the sun-beam appeared as numerous and\r\nmore lucid than the drops of rain, as if the heavens were showering\r\ndown brilliant gems.--Afterwards, in the following year, one Sunday,\r\na little before sun-set, I was enjoying a stroll with a friend at a\r\ngreater distance from the river, when in a field by the road-side\r\nthe same pleasing scene was renewed, but in a style of still greater\r\nmagnificence; for, from some cause in the atmosphere, the insects\r\nat a distance looked much larger than they really were. The choral\r\ndances consisted principally of _Ephemeræ_, but there were also\r\nsome of _Chironomi_; the former, however, being most conspicuous,\r\nattracted our chief attention--alternately rising and falling, in\r\nthe full beam they appeared so transparent and glorious, that they\r\nscarcely resembled any thing material--they reminded us of angels\r\nand glorified spirits drinking life and joy in the effulgence of the\r\nDivine favour[5]. The bard of Twickenham, from the terms in which his\r\nbeautiful description of his sylphs is conceived in _The Rape of the\r\nLock_, seems to have witnessed the pleasing scene here described:\r\n\r\n          \"Some to the sun their insect wings unfold,\r\n           Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;\r\n           Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,\r\n           Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light;\r\n           Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,\r\n           Thin glittering textures of the filmy dew,\r\n           Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies,\r\n           Where light disports in ever mingling dyes,\r\n           While every beam new transient colours flings,\r\n           Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings.\"\r\n\r\nI wish you may have the good fortune next year to be a spectator of\r\nthis all but celestial dance. In the mean time, in May and June,\r\ntheir season of love, you may often receive much gratification from\r\nobserving the motions of a countless host of little black flies of\r\nthe genus _Hilara_, (_H. maura_,) which at this period of the year\r\nassemble to wheel in aëry circles over stagnant waters, with a rush\r\nresembling that of a hasty shower driven by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe next description of insect associations is of those that\r\ncongregate for the purpose of travelling or emigrating together. De\r\nGeer has given an account of the larvæ of certain gnats (_Tipulariæ_)\r\nwhich assemble in considerable numbers for this purpose, so as to\r\nform a band of a finger's breadth, and of from one to two yards\r\nin length. And, what is remarkable, while upon their march, which\r\nis very slow, they adhere to each other by a kind of glutinous\r\nsecretion; but when disturbed they separate without difficulty[6].\r\nKuhn mentions another of the same tribe (from the antennæ in his\r\nfigure, which is very indifferent, it should seem a species of\r\nagaric-gnat (_Mycetophila_)), the larvæ of which live in society\r\nand emigrate in files, like the caterpillar of the procession-moth.\r\nFirst goes one, next follow two, then three, &c., so as to exhibit a\r\nserpentine appearance, probably from their simultaneous undulating\r\nmotion and the continuity of the files; whence the common people in\r\nGermany call them (or rather the file when on march) _heerwurm_, and\r\nview them with great dread, regarding them as ominous of war. These\r\nlarvæ are apodes, white, subtransparent, with black heads[7].--But of\r\ninsect emigrants none are more celebrated than the locusts, which,\r\nwhen arrived at their perfect state, assemble as before related,\r\nin such numbers, as in their flight to intercept the sunbeams, and\r\nto darken whole countries; passing from one region to another, and\r\nlaying waste kingdom after kingdom:--but upon these I have already\r\nsaid much, and shall have occasion again to enlarge.--The same\r\ntendency to shift their quarters has been observed in our little\r\nindigenous devourers, the Aphides. Mr. White tells us, that about\r\nthree o'clock in the afternoon of the first of August 1785, the\r\npeople of the village of Selborne were surprised by a shower of\r\nAphides or smother-flies, which fell in those parts. Those that\r\nwalked in the street at that juncture found themselves covered with\r\nthese insects, which settled also upon the hedges and in the gardens,\r\nblackening all the vegetables where they alighted. His annuals were\r\ndiscoloured by them, and the stalks of a bed of onions quite coated\r\nover for six days after. These armies, he observes, were then, no\r\ndoubt, in a state of emigration, and shifting their quarters; and\r\nmight have come from the great hop-plantations of Kent or Sussex,\r\nthe wind being all that day in the east. They were observed at the\r\nsame time in great clouds about Farnham, and all along the vale from\r\nFarnham to Alton[8]. A similar emigration of these flies I once\r\nwitnessed, to my great annoyance, when travelling later in the year,\r\nin the Isle of Ely. The air was so full of them, that they were\r\nincessantly flying into my eyes, nostrils, &c.; and my clothes were\r\ncovered by them. And in 1814, in the autumn, the Aphides were so\r\nabundant for a few days in the vicinity of Ipswich, as to be noticed\r\nwith surprise by the most incurious observers.\r\n\r\nAs the locust-eating thrush (_Turdus gryllivorus_) accompanies\r\nthe locusts, so the lady-birds (_Coccinellæ_) seem to pursue the\r\nAphides; for I know no other reason to assign for the vast number\r\nthat are sometimes, especially in the autumn, to be met with on the\r\nsea-coast or the banks of large rivers. Many years ago, those of\r\nthe Humber were so thickly strewed with the common Lady-bird (_C.\r\nseptempunctata_), that it was difficult to avoid treading upon them.\r\nSome years afterwards I noticed a mixture of species, collected in\r\nvast numbers, on the sand-hills on the sea-shore, at the north-west\r\nextremity of Norfolk. My friend the Rev. Peter Lathbury made long\r\nsince a similar observation at Orford, on the Suffolk coast; and\r\nabout five or six years ago they covered the cliffs, as I have\r\nbefore remarked[9], of all the watering-places on the Kentish and\r\nSussex coasts, to the no small alarm of the superstitious, who\r\nthought them forerunners of some direful evil. These last probably\r\nemigrated with the Aphides from the hop-grounds. Whether the latter\r\nand their devourers cross the sea has not been ascertained; that the\r\nCoccinellæ attempt it, is evident from their alighting upon ships at\r\nsea, as I have witnessed myself.--This appears clearly to have been\r\nthe case with another emigrating insect, the saw-fly (_Athalia?_) of\r\nthe turnip (which, though so mischievous, appears never to have been\r\ndescribed; it is nearly related to _A. Centifoliæ_)[10]. It is the\r\ngeneral opinion in Norfolk, Mr. Marshall informs us[11], that these\r\ninsects come from over sea. A farmer declared he saw them arrive in\r\nclouds so as to darken the air; the fishermen asserted that they had\r\nrepeatedly seen flights of them pass over their heads when they were\r\nat a distance from land; and on the beach and cliffs they were in\r\nsuch quantities, that they might have been taken up by shovels-full.\r\nThree miles in-land they were described as resembling swarms of\r\nbees. This was in August 1782. Unentomological observers, such as\r\nfarmers and fishermen, might easily mistake one kind of insect for\r\nanother; but supposing them correct, the swarms in question might\r\nperhaps have passed from Lincolnshire to Norfolk.--Meinecken tells\r\nus, that he once saw in a village in Anhalt, on a clear day, about\r\nfour in the afternoon, such a cloud of dragon-flies (_Libellulina_)\r\nas almost concealed the sun, and not a little alarmed the villagers,\r\nunder the idea that they were locusts[12]: several instances are\r\ngiven by Rösel of similar clouds of these insects having been seen in\r\nSilesia and other districts[13]; and Mr. Woolnough of Hollesley in\r\nSuffolk, a most attentive observer of nature, once witnessed such an\r\narmy of the smaller dragon-flies (_Agrion_) flying in-land from the\r\nsea, as to cast a slight shadow over a field of four acres as they\r\npassed.--Professor Walch states, that one night about eleven o'clock,\r\nsitting in his study, his attention was attracted by what seemed the\r\npelting of hail against his window, which surprising him by its long\r\ncontinuance, he opened the window, and found the noise was occasioned\r\nby a flight of the froth frog-hopper (_Cercopis spumaria_), which\r\nentered the room in such numbers as to cover the table. From this\r\ncircumstance and the continuance of the pelting, which lasted at\r\nleast half an hour, an idea may be formed of the vast host of this\r\ninsect passing over. It passed from east to west; and as his window\r\nfaced the south, they only glanced against it obliquely[14]. He\r\nafterwards witnessed, in August, a similar emigration of myriads of\r\na kind of ground-beetle (_Amara vulgaris_,)[15].--Another writer in\r\nthe same work, H. Kapp, observed on a calm sunny day a prodigious\r\nflight of the noxious cabbage-butterfly (_Pontia Brassicæ_), which\r\npassed from north-east to south-west, and lasted two hours[16]. Kalm\r\nsaw these last insects midway in the British Channel[17]. Lindley, a\r\nwriter in the _Royal Military Chronicle_, tells us, that in Brazil,\r\nin the beginning of March 1803, for many days successively there\r\nwas an immense flight of white and yellow butterflies, probably\r\nof the same tribe as the cabbage-butterfly. They were observed\r\nnever to settle, but proceeded in a direction from north-west to\r\nsouth-east. No buildings seemed to stop them from steadily pursuing\r\ntheir course; which being to the ocean, at only a small distance,\r\nthey must consequently perish. It is remarked that at this time no\r\nother kind of butterfly is to be seen, though the country usually\r\nabounds in such a variety[18].--Major Moor, while stationed at\r\nBombay, as he was playing at chess one evening with a friend in Old\r\nWoman's Island, near that place, witnessed an immense flight of bugs\r\n(_Geocorisæ_), which were going westward. They were so numerous as\r\nto cover every thing in the apartment in which he was sitting.--When\r\nstaying at Aldeburgh, on the eastern coast, I have, at certain times,\r\nseen innumerable insects upon the beach close to the waves, and\r\napparently washed up by them. Though wetted, they were quite alive.\r\nIt is remarkable, that of the emigrating insects here enumerated,\r\nthe majority--for instance the lady-birds, saw-flies, dragon-flies,\r\nground-beetles, frog-hoppers, &c.--are not usually social insects,\r\nbut seem to congregate, like swallows, merely for the purpose of\r\nemigration. What incites them to this is one of those mysteries\r\nof nature, which at present we cannot penetrate. A scarcity of\r\nfood urges the locusts to shift their quarters; and too confined a\r\nspace to accommodate their numbers occasions the bees to swarm: but\r\nneither of these motives can operate in causing unsocial insects to\r\ncongregate. It is still more difficult to account for the impulse\r\nthat urges these creatures, with their filmy wings and fragile form,\r\nto attempt to cross the ocean, and expose themselves, one would\r\nthink, to inevitable destruction. Yet, though we are unable to assign\r\nthe cause of this singular instinct, some of the reasons which\r\ninduced the Creator to endow them with it may be conjectured. This is\r\nclearly one of the modes by which their numbers are kept within due\r\nlimits, as, doubtless, the great majority of these adventurers perish\r\nin the waters. Thus, also, a great supply of food is furnished to\r\nthose fish in the sea itself, which at other seasons ascend the\r\nrivers in search of them; and this probably is one of the means, if\r\nnot the only one, to which the numerous islands of this globe are\r\nindebted for their insect population. Whether the insects I observed\r\nupon the beach wetted by the waves, had flown from our own shores,\r\nand falling into the water had been brought back by the tide; or\r\nwhether they had succeeded in the attempt to pass from the continent\r\nto us, by flying as far as they could, and then falling had been\r\nbrought by the waves, cannot certainly be ascertained; but Kalm's\r\nobservation inclines me to the latter opinion.\r\n\r\nThe next order of imperfect associations is that of those insects\r\nwhich feed together:--these are of two descriptions--those that\r\nassociate in their _first_ or _last_ state only, and those that\r\nassociate in _all_ their states. The first of these associations is\r\noften very short-lived: a patch of eggs is glued to a leaf; when\r\nhatched, the little larvæ feed side by side very amicably, and a\r\npleasant sight it is to see the regularity with which this work is\r\noften done, as if by word of command; but when the leaf that served\r\nfor their cradle is consumed, their society is dissolved, and each\r\ngoes where he can to seek his own fortune, regardless of the fate or\r\nlot of his brethren. Of this kind are the larvæ of the saw-fly of\r\nthe gooseberry, whose ravages I have recorded before[19], and that\r\nof the cabbage-butterfly; the latter, however, keep longer together,\r\nand seldom wholly separate. In their final state, I have noticed\r\nthat the individuals of _Thrips Physapus_, the fly that causes us\r\nin hot weather such intolerable titillation, are very fond of each\r\nother's company when they feed. Towards the latter end of last July,\r\nwalking through a wheat-field, I observed that all the blossoms of\r\n_Convolvulus arvensis_, though very numerous, were interiorly turned\r\nquite black by the infinite number of these insects, which were\r\ncoursing about within them.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting insects of this order are those which\r\nassociate in _all_ their states.--Two populous tribes, the great\r\ndevastators of the vegetable world, the one in warm and the other\r\nin cold climates, to which I have already alluded under the head\r\nof emigrations--you perceive I am speaking of _Aphides_ and\r\n_Locusts_--are the best examples of this order: although, concerning\r\nthe societies of the first, at present we can only say that they are\r\nmerely the result of a common origin and station: but those of the\r\nlatter, the locusts, wear more the appearance of design, and of being\r\nproduced by the social principle.\r\n\r\nSo much as the world has suffered from these animals[20], it is\r\nextraordinary that so few observations have been made upon their\r\nhistory, economy, and mode of proceeding. One of the best accounts\r\nseems to be that of Professor Pallas, in his _Travels into the\r\nSouthern Provinces of the Russian Empire_. The species to which\r\nhis principal attention was paid appears to have been the _Locusta\r\nitalica_, in its larva and pupa state. \"In serene warm weather,\"\r\nsays he, \"the locusts are in full motion in the morning immediately\r\nafter the evaporation of the dew; and if no dew has fallen, they\r\nappear as soon as the sun imparts his genial warmth. At first some\r\nare seen running about like messengers among the reposing swarms,\r\nwhich are lying partly compressed upon the ground, at the side of\r\nsmall eminences, and partly attached to tall plants and shrubs.\r\nShortly after the whole body begins to move forward in one direction\r\nand with little deviation. They resemble a swarm of ants, all taking\r\nthe same course, at small distances, but without touching each other:\r\nthey uniformly travel towards a certain region as fast as a fly can\r\nrun, and without leaping, unless pursued; in which case, indeed, they\r\ndisperse, but soon collect again and follow their former route. In\r\nthis manner they advance from morning to evening without halting,\r\nfrequently at the rate of a hundred fathoms and upwards in the course\r\nof a day. Although they prefer marching along high roads, footpaths,\r\nor open tracts; yet when their progress is opposed by bushes, hedges,\r\nand ditches, they penetrate through them: their way can only be\r\nimpeded by the waters of brooks or canals, as they are apparently\r\nterrified at every kind of moisture. Often, however, they endeavour\r\nto gain the opposite bank with the aid of overhanging boughs; and if\r\nthe stalks of plants or shrubs be laid across the water, they pass\r\nin close columns over these temporary bridges; on which they even\r\nseem to rest and enjoy the refreshing coolness. Towards sunset the\r\nwhole swarm gradually collect in parties, and creep up the plants,\r\nor encamp on slight eminences. On cold, cloudy, or rainy days they\r\ndo not travel.--As soon as they acquire wings they progressively\r\ndisperse, but still fly about in large swarms[21].\"\r\n\r\n\"In the month of May, when the ovaries of these insects were\r\nripe and turgid,\" says Dr. Shaw[22], \"each of these swarms began\r\ngradually to disappear, and retired into the Mettijiah, and other\r\nadjacent plains, where they deposited their eggs. These were no\r\nsooner hatched in June, than each of the broods collected itself\r\ninto a compact body, of a furlong or more in square; and marching\r\nafterwards directly forwards toward the sea, they let nothing\r\nescape them----_they kept their ranks, like men of war_; climbing\r\nover, as they advanced, every tree or wall that was in their way;\r\nnay, they entered into our very houses and bed-chambers, like\r\n_so many thieves_.----A day or two after one of these hordes was\r\nin motion, others were already hatched to march and glean after\r\nthem.----Having lived near a month in this manner----they arrived\r\nat their full growth, and threw off their _nympha-state_ by casting\r\ntheir outward skin. To prepare themselves for this change, they\r\nclung by their hinder feet to some bush, twig, or corner of a\r\nstone; and immediately, by using an undulating motion, their heads\r\nwould first break out, and then the rest of their bodies. The whole\r\ntransformation was performed in seven or eight minutes; after which\r\nthey lay for a small time in a torpid and seemingly in a languishing\r\ncondition; but as soon as the sun and the air had hardened their\r\nwings, by drying up the moisture that remained upon them after\r\ncasting their sloughs, they reassumed their former voracity, with an\r\naddition of strength and agility. Yet they continued not long in this\r\nstate before they were entirely dispersed.\" The species Dr. Shaw here\r\nspeaks of is probably not the _Locusta migratoria_.\r\n\r\nThe old Arabian fable, that they are directed in their flights\r\nby a leader or king[23], has been adopted: but I think without\r\nsufficient reason, by several travellers. Thus Benjamin Bullivant,\r\nin his observations on the Natural History of New England[24], says\r\nthat \"the locusts have a kind of regimental discipline, and as it\r\nwere some commanders, which show greater and more splendid wings\r\nthan the common ones, and arise first when pursued by the fowls or\r\nthe feet of the traveller, as I have often seriously remarked.\"\r\nAnd in like terms Jackson observes, that \"they have a government\r\namongst themselves similar to that of the bees and ants; and when the\r\n(_Sultan Jerraad_) king of the locusts rises, the whole body follow\r\nhim, not one solitary straggler being left behind[25].\" But that\r\nlocusts have leaders, like the bees or ants, distinguished from the\r\nrest by the size and splendour of their wings, is a circumstance that\r\nhas not yet been established by any satisfactory evidence; indeed,\r\nvery strong reasons may be urged against it. The nations of bees and\r\nants, it must be observed, are housed together in one nest or hive,\r\nthe whole population of which is originally derived from one common\r\nmother, and the leaders of the swarms in each are the females. But\r\nthe armies of locusts, though they herd together, travel together,\r\nand feed together, consist of an infinity of separate families, all\r\nderived from different mothers, who have laid their eggs in separate\r\ncells or houses in the earth; so that there is little or no analogy\r\nbetween the societies of locusts and those of bees and ants; and this\r\npretended sultan is something quite different from the queen-bee or\r\nthe female ants. It follows, therefore, that as the locusts have no\r\ncommon mother, like the bees, to lead their swarms, there is no one\r\nthat nature, by a different organization and ampler dimensions,\r\nand a more august form, has destined to this high office. The only\r\nquestion remaining is, whether one be elected from the rest by common\r\nconsent as their leader, or whether their instinct impels them to\r\nfollow the first that takes flight or alights. This last is the\r\nlearned Bochart's opinion, and seems much the most reasonable[26].\r\nThe absurdity of the other supposition, that an election is made,\r\nwill appear from such queries as these, at which you may smile.--Who\r\nare the electors? Are the myriads of millions all consulted, or is\r\nthe elective franchise confined to a few? Who holds the courts and\r\ntakes the votes? Who casts them up and declares the result? When is\r\nthe election made?--The larvæ appear to be as much under government\r\nas the perfect insect.--Is the monarch then chosen by his peers\r\nwhen they first leave the egg and emerge from their subterranean\r\ncaverns? or have larva, pupa, and imago each their separate king? The\r\naccount given us in Scripture is certainly much the most probable,\r\nthat the locusts have no king, though they observe as much order\r\nand regularity in their movements as if they were under military\r\ndiscipline, and had a ruler over them[27]. Some species of ants, as\r\nwe learn from the admirable history of them by M. P. Huber, though\r\nthey go forth by common consent upon their military expeditions, yet\r\nthe order of their columns keeps perpetually changing; so that those\r\nwho lead the van at the first setting out, soon fall into the rear,\r\nand others take their place: their successors do the same; and such\r\nis the constant order of their march. It seems probable, as these\r\ncolumns are extended to a considerable length, that the object of\r\nthis successive change of leaders is to convey constant intelligence\r\nto those in the rear, of what is going forward in the van. Whether\r\nany thing like this takes place for the regulation of their motions\r\nin the innumerable locust-armies, which are sometimes co-extensive\r\nwith vast kingdoms; or whether their instinct simply directs them\r\nto follow the first that moves or flies, and to keep their measured\r\ndistance, so that, as the prophet speaks, \"one does not thrust\r\nanother, and they walk every one in his path[28],\" must be left to\r\nfuture naturalists to ascertain. And I think that you will join with\r\nme in the wish that travellers, who have a taste for Natural History,\r\nand some knowledge of insects, would devote a share of attention to\r\nthe proceedings of these celebrated animals, so that we might have\r\nfacts instead of fables.\r\n\r\nThe last order of imperfect associations approaches nearer to perfect\r\nsocieties, and is that of those insects which the social principle\r\nurges to unite in some common work for the benefit of the community.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Coleoptera_, _Ateuchus pilularius_, a beetle before\r\nmentioned, acts under the influence of this principle. \"I have\r\nattentively admired their industry and mutual assisting of each\r\nother,\" says Catesby, \"in rolling those globular balls from the\r\nplace where they made them, to that of their interment, which is\r\nusually the distance of some yards, more or less. This they perform\r\nbreech foremost, by raising their hind parts, forcing along the ball\r\nwith their hind feet. Two or three of them are sometimes engaged\r\nin trundling one ball, which, from meeting with impediments from\r\nthe unevenness of the ground, is sometimes deserted by them: it is\r\nhowever attempted by others with success, unless it happens to roll\r\ninto some deep hollow chink, where they are constrained to leave it;\r\nbut they continue their work by rolling off the next ball that comes\r\nin their way. None of them seem to know their own balls, but an equal\r\ncare for the whole appears to affect all the community[29].\"\r\n\r\nMany larvæ also of _Lepidoptera_ associate with this view, some of\r\nwhich are social only during part of their existence, and others\r\nduring the whole of it. The first of these continue together while\r\ntheir united labours are beneficial to them; but when they reach a\r\ncertain period of their life, they disperse and become solitary.\r\nOf this kind are the caterpillars of a little butterfly (_Melitæa\r\nCinxia_) which devour the narrow-leaved plantain. The families\r\nof these, usually amounting to about a hundred, unite to form a\r\npyramidal silken tent, containing several apartments, which is\r\npitched over some of the plants that constitute their food, and\r\nshelters them both from the sun and the rain. When they have consumed\r\nthe provision which it covers, they construct a new one over other\r\nroots of this plant; and sometimes four or five of these encampments\r\nmay be seen within a foot or two of each other. Against winter they\r\nweave and erect a stronger habitation of a rounder form, not divided\r\nby any partitions, in which they lie heaped one upon another, each\r\nbeing rolled up. About April they separate, and continue solitary\r\ntill they assume the pupa.\r\n\r\nReaumur, to whom I am indebted for this account, has also given\r\nus an interesting history of another insect, the gold-tail-moth\r\n(_Arctia chrysorhœa_) before mentioned, whose caterpillars are of\r\nthis description. They belong to that family of _Bombycidæ_, which\r\nenvelop their eggs in hair plucked from their own body. As soon\r\nas one of these young caterpillars is disclosed from the egg, it\r\nbegins to feed; another quickly joins it, placing itself by its\r\nside; thus they proceed in succession till a file is formed across\r\nthe leaf:--a second is then begun; and after this is completed, a\r\nthird--and so they proceed till the whole upper surface of the leaf\r\nis covered:--but as a single leaf will not contain the whole family,\r\nthe remainder take their station upon the adjoining ones. No sooner\r\nhave they satisfied the cravings of hunger, than they begin to think\r\nof erecting a common habitation, which at first is only a vaulted\r\nweb, that covers the leaf they inhabit, but by their united labours\r\nin due time grows into a magnificent tent of silk, containing various\r\napartments sufficient to defend and shelter them all from the attack\r\nof enemies and the inclemency of the seasons. As our caterpillars,\r\nlike eastern monarchs, are too delicate to adventure their feet\r\nupon the rough bark of the tree upon which they feed, they lay a\r\nsilken carpet over every road and pathway leading to their palace,\r\nwhich extends as far as they have occasion to go for food. To the\r\nhabitation just described they retreat during heavy rains, and\r\nwhen the sun is too hot:--they likewise pass part of the night in\r\nthem;--and, indeed, at all times some may usually be found at home.\r\nUpon any sudden alarm they retreat to them for safety, and also when\r\nthey cast their skins:--in the winter they are wholly confined to\r\nthem, emerging again in the spring: but in May and June they entirely\r\ndesert them; and, losing all their love for society, live in\r\nsolitude till they become pupæ, which takes place in about a month.\r\nWhen they desert their nests, the spiders take possession of them;\r\nwhich has given rise to a prevalent though most absurd opinion, that\r\nthey are the parents of these caterpillars[30].\r\n\r\nWith other caterpillars the association continues during the whole of\r\nthe larva state. De Geer mentions one of the saw-flies (_Serrifera_)\r\nof this description which form a common nidus by connecting leaves\r\ntogether with silken threads, each larva moreover spinning a tube of\r\nthe same material for its own private apartment, in which it glides\r\nbackwards and forwards upon its back[31]. I have observed similar\r\nnidi in this country; the insects that form them belong to the\r\nFabrician genus _Lyda_.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable insects, however, that arrange under this class\r\nof imperfect associates, are those that observe a particular order\r\nof march. Though they move without beat of drum, they maintain as\r\nmuch regularity in their step as a file of soldiers. It is a most\r\nagreeable sight, says one of Nature's most favoured admirers, Bonnet,\r\nto see several hundreds of the larvæ of _Trichoda Neustria_ marching\r\nafter each other, some in straight lines, others in curves of various\r\ninflection, resembling, from their fiery colour, a moving cord of\r\ngold stretched upon a silken ribband of the purest white; this\r\nribband is the carpeted causeway that leads to their leafy pasture\r\nfrom their nest. Equally amusing is the progress of another moth,\r\nthe _Pityocampa_, before noticed; they march together from their\r\ncommon citadel, consisting of pine leaves united and inwoven with\r\nthe silk which they spin, in a single line: in following each other\r\nthey describe a multitude of graceful curves of varying figure, thus\r\nforming a series of living wreaths, which change their shape every\r\nmoment:--all move with a uniform pace, no one pressing too forward or\r\nloitering behind; when the first stops, all stop, each defiling in\r\nexact military order[32].\r\n\r\nA still more singular and pleasing spectacle, when their regiments\r\nmarch out to forage, is exhibited by the caterpillars of the\r\n_Processionary_ moth _Lasiocampa processionea_. This moth,\r\nwhich is a native of France, and has not yet been found in this\r\ncountry, inhabits the oak. Each family consists of from 600 to 800\r\nindividuals. When young, they have no fixed habitation, but encamp\r\nsometimes in one place and sometimes in another, under the shelter of\r\ntheir web: but when they have attained two-thirds of their growth,\r\nthey weave for themselves a common tent, before described[33].\r\nAbout sun-set the regiment leaves its quarters; or, to make the\r\nmetaphor harmonize with the trivial name of the animal, the monks\r\ntheir cœnobium. At their head is a chief, by whose movements their\r\nprocession is regulated. When he stops, all stop, and proceed when\r\nhe proceeds; three or four of his immediate followers succeed in the\r\nsame line, the head of the second touching the tail of the first:\r\nthen comes an equal series of pairs, next of threes, and so on as\r\nfar as fifteen or twenty. The whole procession moves regularly on\r\nwith an even pace, each file treading upon the steps of those that\r\nprecede it. If the leader, arriving at a particular point, pursues\r\na different direction, all march to that point before they turn.\r\nProbably in this they are guided by some scent imparted to the tracks\r\nby those that pass over them. Sometimes the order of procession\r\nis different; the leader, who moves singly, is followed by two,\r\nthese are succeeded by three, then come four, and so on. When the\r\nleader,--who in nothing differs from the rest, and is probably the\r\ncaterpillar nearest the entrance to the nest, followed, as I have\r\ndescribed,--has proceeded to the distance of about two feet, more\r\nor less, he makes a halt; during which those which remain come\r\nforth, take their places, the company forms into files, the march is\r\nresumed, and all follow as regularly as if they kept time to music.\r\nThese larvæ may be occasionally found at mid-day out of their nests,\r\npacked close one to another without making any movement; so that,\r\nalthough they occupy a space sufficiently ample, it is not easy to\r\ndiscover them. At other times, instead of being simply laid side by\r\nside, they are formed into singular masses, in which they are heaped\r\none upon another, and as it were interwoven together. Thus also they\r\nare disposed in their nests. Sometimes their families divide into two\r\nbands, which never afterwards unite[34].\r\n\r\nI have nothing further of importance to communicate to you on\r\nimperfect societies: in my next I shall begin the most interesting\r\nsubject that Entomology offers; a subject, to say the least,\r\nincluding as great a portion both of instruction and amusement as\r\nany branch of Natural History affords;--I mean those _perfect_\r\nassociations which have for their great object the multiplication of\r\nthe species, and the education, if such a term may be here employed,\r\nof the young. This is too fertile a theme to be confined to a single\r\nletter, but must occupy several.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See also Markwick in White's _Nat.

(_White Ants and Ants._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe associations of insects of which my last letter gave you a\r\ndetail, were of a very imperfect kind, both as to their object and\r\nduration: but those which I am now to lay before you exhibit the\r\nsemblance of a nearer approach, both in their principle and its\r\nresults, to the societies of man himself. There are two kindred\r\nsentiments, that in these last act with most powerful energy--desire\r\nand affection.--From the first proceed many wants that cannot\r\nbe satisfied without the intercourse, aid, and co-operation of\r\nothers; and by the last we are impelled to seek the good of certain\r\nobjects, and to delight in their society. Thus self-love combines\r\nwith philanthropy to produce the social principle, both desire and\r\nlove alternately urging us to an intercourse with each other; and\r\nfrom these in union originate the multiplication and preservation\r\nof the species. These two passions are the master-movers in this\r\nbusiness; but there is a third subsidiary to them, which, though it\r\ntrenches upon the social principle, considered abstractedly, is often\r\na powerful bond of union in separate societies--you will readily\r\nperceive that I am speaking of fear;--under the influence of this\r\npassion these are drawn closer together, and unite more intimately\r\nfor defence against some common enemy, and to raise works of munition\r\nthat may resist his attack.\r\n\r\nThe main instrument of association is language, and no association\r\ncan be perfect where there is not a common tongue. The origin of\r\nnationality was difference of speech: at Babel, when tongues were\r\ndivided, nations separated. Language may be understood in a larger\r\nsense than to signify inflections of the voice,--it may well include\r\nall the means of making yourself understood by another, whether by\r\ngestures, sounds, signs, or words: the two first of these kinds may\r\nbe called natural language, and the two last arbitrary or artificial.\r\n\r\nI have said that perfect societies of insects exhibit the _semblance_\r\nof a nearer approach, both in their principle and its results, to\r\nthe societies of man himself, because, unless we could perfectly\r\nunderstand what instinct is, and how it acts, we cannot, without\r\nexposing ourselves to the charge of temerity, assert that these are\r\nprecisely the same.\r\n\r\nBut when we consider the object of these societies, the preservation\r\nand multiplication of the species; and the means by which that object\r\nis attained, the united labours and co-operation of perhaps millions\r\nof individuals, it seems as if they were impelled by passions very\r\nsimilar to those main-springs of human associations, which I have just\r\nenumerated. Desire appears to stimulate them--love to allure them--fear\r\nto alarm them. They want a habitation to reside in, and food for their\r\nsubsistence. Does not this look as if desire were the operating cause,\r\nwhich induces them to unite their labours to construct the one and\r\nprovide the other? Their nests contain a numerous family of helpless\r\nbrood. Does not love here seem to urge them to that exemplary and fond\r\nattention, and those unremitted and indefatigable exertions manifested\r\nby the whole community for the benefit of these dear objects? Is it\r\nnot also evidenced by their general and singular attachment to their\r\nfemales, by their mutual caresses, by their feeding each other, by\r\ntheir apparent sympathy with suffering individuals and endeavours to\r\nrelieve them, by their readiness to help those that are in difficulty,\r\nand finally by their sports and assemblies for relaxation? That fear\r\nproduces its influence upon them seems no less evident, when we see\r\nthem, agitated by the approach of enemies, endeavour to remove what\r\nis most dear to them beyond their reach, unite their efforts to\r\nrepel their attacks, and to construct works of defence. They appear\r\nto have besides a common language; for they possess the faculty, by\r\nsignificative gestures and sounds, of communicating their wants and\r\nideas to each other[35].\r\n\r\nThere are, however, the following great differences between human\r\nsocieties and those of insects. Man is susceptible of individual\r\nattachment, which forms the basis of his happiness, and the source\r\nof his purest and dearest enjoyments:--whereas the love of insects\r\nseems to be a kind of instinctive patriotism that is extended to the\r\nwhole community, never distinguishing individuals, unless, as in the\r\ninstance of the female bee, connected with that great object.\r\n\r\nMan also, endowed with reason, forms a judgement from circumstances,\r\nand by a variety of means can attain the same end. Besides\r\nthe language of nature, gestures, and exclamations, which the\r\npassions produce, he is gifted with the divine faculty of speech,\r\nand can express his thoughts by articulate sounds or artificial\r\nlanguage.--Not so our social insects. Every species has its peculiar\r\nmode of proceeding, to which it adheres as to the law of its nature,\r\nnever deviating but under the control of imperious circumstances;\r\nfor in particular instances, as you will see when I come to treat of\r\ntheir instincts, they know how to vary, though not very materially,\r\nfrom the usual mode[36]. But they never depart, like man, from the\r\ngeneral system; and, in common with the rest of the animal kingdom,\r\nthey have no articulate language.\r\n\r\nHuman associations, under the direction of reason and revelation,\r\nare also formed with higher views,--I mean as to government, morals,\r\nand religion:--with respect to the last of these, the social insects\r\nof course can have nothing to do, except that by their wonderful\r\nproceedings they give man an occasion of glorifying his great\r\nCreator; but in their instincts, extraordinary as it may seem, they\r\nexhibit a semblance of the two former, as will abundantly appear in\r\nthe course of our correspondence.\r\n\r\nI shall not detain you longer by prefatory remarks from the amusing\r\nscene to which I am eager to introduce you; but the following\r\nobservations of M. P. Huber on this subject are so just and striking,\r\nthat I cannot refrain from copying them.\r\n\r\n\"The history of insects that live in solitude consists of their\r\ngeneration, their peculiar habits, the metamorphoses they undergo;\r\ntheir manner of life under each successive form; the stratagems for\r\nthe attack of their enemies, and the skill with which they construct\r\ntheir habitation: but that of insects which form numerous societies,\r\nis not confined to some remarkable proceedings, to some peculiar\r\ntalent: it offers new relations, which arise from common interest;\r\nfrom the equality or superiority of rank; from the part which each\r\nmember supports in the society;--and all these relations suppose a\r\nconnexion between the different individuals of which it consists,\r\nthat can scarcely exist but by the intervention of language: for such\r\nmay be called every mode of expressing their wishes, their wants,\r\nand even their ideas, if that name may be given to the impulses of\r\ninstinct. It would be difficult to explain in any other way that\r\nconcurrence of all wills to one end, and that species of harmony\r\nwhich the whole of their institution exhibits.\"\r\n\r\nThe great end of the societies of insects being the rapid\r\nmultiplication of the species, Providence has employed extraordinary\r\nmeans to secure the fulfilment of this object, by creating a\r\nparticular order of individuals in each society, which, freed from\r\nsexual pursuits, may give themselves wholly to labour, and thus\r\nabsolve the females from every employment but that of furnishing\r\nthe society from time to time with a sufficient supply of eggs to\r\nkeep up the population to its proper standard. In the case of the\r\n_Termites_, the office of working for the society, as these insects\r\nbelong to an order whose metamorphosis is _semi-complete_, devolves\r\nupon the larvæ; the neuters, unless these should prove to be the\r\nlarvæ of males, being the soldiers of the community.\r\n\r\nFrom this circumstance perfect societies may be divided into two\r\nclasses; the first including those whose workers are _larvæ_, and the\r\nsecond those whose workers are _neuters_[37]. The white ants belong to\r\nthe former of these classes, and the social _Hymenoptera_ to the latter.\r\n\r\nBefore I begin with the history of the societies of white ants, I\r\nmust notice a remark that has been made applying to societies in\r\ngeneral--that numbers are essential to the full development of the\r\ninstinct of social animals. This has been observed by Bonnet with\r\nrespect to the beaver[38]; by Reaumur of the hive-bee; and by M. P.\r\nHuber of the humble-bee[39]. Amongst hymenopterous social insects,\r\nhowever, the observation seems not universally applicable, but only\r\nunder particular circumstances; for in incipient societies of ants,\r\nhumble-bees, and wasps, one female lays the foundations of them at\r\nfirst by herself; and the first brood of neuters that is hatched is\r\nvery small.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have on a former occasion given you some account of the\r\ndevastation produced by the white ants, or _Termites_, the species of\r\nwhich constitute the first class of perfect societies[40]; I shall\r\nnow relate to you some further particulars of their history, which\r\nwill, I hope, give you a better opinion of them.\r\n\r\nThe majority of these animals are natives of tropical countries,\r\nthough two species are indigenous to Europe; one of which, thought to\r\nhave been imported, is come so near to us as Bourdeaux. The fullest\r\naccount hitherto given of their history is that of Mr. Smeathman, in\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1781; which, since it has in\r\nmany particulars been confirmed by the observations of succeeding\r\nnaturalists, though in some things he was evidently mistaken, I shall\r\nabridge for you, correcting him where he appears to be in error, and\r\nadding from Latreille, and the MS. of a French naturalist resident\r\non the spot, kindly furnished by Professor Hooker, what they have\r\nobserved with respect to those of Bourdeaux and Ceylon. The white\r\nants, though they belong to the _Neuroptera_ order, borrow their\r\ninstinct from the hymenopterous social tribes, and in conjunction\r\nwith the ants (_Formica_) connect the two orders. Their societies\r\nconsist of five different descriptions of individuals--workers or\r\nlarvæ--nymphs or pupæ--neuters or soldiers--males and females.\r\n\r\n1. The _workers_ or larvæ, answering to the hymenopterous neuters,\r\nare the most numerous and at the same time most active part of the\r\ncommunity; upon whom devolves the office of erecting and repairing\r\nthe buildings, collecting provisions, attending upon the female,\r\nconveying the eggs when laid to what Smeathman calls the nurseries,\r\nand feeding the young larvæ till they are old enough to take care\r\nof themselves. They are distinguished from the soldiers by their\r\ndiminutive size, by their round heads and shorter mandibles.\r\n\r\n2. The _nymphs_ or pupæ. These were not noticed by Smeathman, who\r\nmistook the neuters for them:--they differ in nothing from the larvæ,\r\nand probably are equally active, except that they have rudiments of\r\nwings, or rather the wings folded up in cases (_Pterothecæ_). They were\r\nfirst observed by Latreille; nor did they escape the author of the MS.\r\nabove alluded to, who mistook them for a different kind of larvæ.\r\n\r\n3. The _neuters_, erroneously called by Smeathman pupæ. These are\r\nmuch less numerous than the workers, bearing the proportion of one\r\nto one hundred, and exceeding them greatly in bulk. They are also\r\ndistinguishable by their long and large head, armed with very long\r\nsubulate mandibles. Their office is that of sentinels; and when the\r\nnest is attacked, to them is committed the task of defending it.\r\nThese neuters are quite unlike those in the _Hymenoptera_ perfect\r\nsocieties, which seem to be a kind of abortive females, and there is\r\nnothing analogous to them in any other department of Entomology.\r\n\r\n4. and 5. _Males_ and _females_, or the insects arrived at their state\r\nof perfection, and capable of continuing the species. There is only\r\none of each in every separate society; they are exempted from all\r\nparticipation in the labours and employments occupying the rest of\r\nthe community, that they may be wholly devoted to the furnishing of\r\nconstant accessions to the population of the colony. Though at their\r\nfirst disclosure from the pupa they have four wings, like the female\r\nants they soon cast them; but they may then be distinguished from the\r\nblind larvæ, pupæ, and neuters, by their large and prominent eyes[41].\r\n\r\nThe first establishment of a colony of Termites takes place in the\r\nfollowing manner. In the evening, soon after the first tornado, which\r\nat the latter end of the dry season proclaims the approach of the\r\nensuing rains, these animals, having attained to their perfect state,\r\nin which they are furnished and adorned with two pair of wings, emerge\r\nfrom their clay-built citadels by myriads and myriads to seek their\r\nfortune. Borne on these ample wings, and carried by the wind, they\r\nfill the air, entering the houses, extinguishing the lights, and even\r\nsometimes being driven on board the ships that are not far from the\r\nshore. The next morning they are discovered covering the surface of the\r\nearth and waters: deprived of the wings which before enabled them to\r\navoid their numerous enemies, and which are only calculated to carry\r\nthem a few hours, and looking like large maggots; from the most active,\r\nindustrious, and rapacious, they are now become the most helpless and\r\ncowardly beings in nature, and the prey of innumerable enemies, to\r\nthe smallest of which they make not the least resistance. Insects,\r\nespecially ants, which are always on the hunt for them, leaving no\r\nplace unexplored; birds, reptiles, beasts, and even man himself, look\r\nupon this event as their harvest, and, as you have been told before,\r\nmake them their food; so that scarcely a single pair in many millions\r\nget into a place of safety, fulfill the first law of nature, and lay\r\nthe foundation of a new community. At this time they are seen running\r\nupon the ground, the male after the female, and sometimes two chasing\r\none, and contending with great eagerness, regardless of the innumerable\r\ndangers that surround them, who shall win the prize.\r\n\r\nThe workers, who are continually prowling about in their covered ways,\r\noccasionally meet with one of these pairs, and, being impelled by their\r\ninstinct, pay them homage, and they are elected as it were to be king\r\nand queen, or rather father and mother, of a new colony[42]: all that\r\nare not so fortunate, inevitably perish; and, considering the infinite\r\nhost of their enemies, probably in the course of the following day.\r\nThe workers, as soon as this election takes place, begin to inclose\r\ntheir new rulers in a small chamber of clay, before described[43],\r\nsuited to their size, the entrances to which are only large enough to\r\nadmit themselves and the neuters, but much too small for the royal\r\npair to pass through;--so that their state of royalty is a state of\r\nconfinement, and so continues during the remainder of their existence.\r\nThe impregnation of the female is supposed to take place after this\r\nconfinement, and she soon begins to furnish the infant colony with new\r\ninhabitants. The care of feeding her and her male companion devolves\r\nupon the industrious larvæ, who supply them both with every thing\r\nthat they want. As she increases in dimensions, they keep enlarging\r\nthe cell in which she is detained. When the business of oviposition\r\ncommences, they take the eggs from the female, and deposit them in the\r\nnurseries[44]. Her abdomen now begins gradually to extend, till in\r\nprocess of time it is enlarged to 1500 or 2000 times the size of the\r\nrest of her body, and her bulk equals that of 20,000 or 30,000 workers.\r\nThis part, often more than three inches in length, is now a vast matrix\r\nof eggs, which make long circumvolutions through numberless slender\r\nserpentine vessels:--it is also remarkable for its peristaltic motion,\r\n(in this resembling the female ant[45],) which, like the undulations of\r\nwater, produces a perpetual and successive rise and fall over the whole\r\nsurface of the abdomen, and occasions a constant extrusion of the eggs,\r\namounting sometimes in old females to sixty in a minute, or eighty\r\nthousand and upwards in twenty-four hours[46]. As these females live\r\ntwo years in their perfect state, how astonishing must be the number\r\nproduced in that time!\r\n\r\nThis incessant extrusion of eggs must call for the attention of a\r\nlarge number of the workers in the royal chamber (and indeed it is\r\nalways full of them), to take them as they come forth and carry them\r\nto the nurseries; in which, when hatched, they are provided with\r\nfood, and receive every necessary attention till they are able to\r\nshift for themselves.--One remarkable circumstance attends these\r\nnurseries--they are always covered with a kind of mould, amongst\r\nwhich arise numerous globules about the size of a small pin's head.\r\nThis is probably a species of _Mucor_; and by Mr. König, who\r\nfound them also in nests of an East-Indian species of Termes, is\r\nconjectured to be the food of the larvæ.\r\n\r\nThe royal cell has besides some soldiers in it, a kind of body guard\r\nto the royal pair that inhabit it; and the surrounding apartments\r\ncontain always many both labourers and soldiers in waiting, that they\r\nmay successively attend upon and defend the common father and mother,\r\non whose safety depend the happiness and even existence of the whole\r\ncommunity; and whom these faithful subjects never abandon even in the\r\nlast distress.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the Termites feed the young brood, before they\r\ncommence their active life and are admitted to share in the labours of\r\nthe nest, has not, as far as I know, been recorded by any writer: I\r\nshall therefore leave them in their nurseries, and introduce you to the\r\nbustling scene which these creatures exhibit in their first state after\r\nthey are become useful. To do this, in vain should I carry you to one\r\nof their nests--you would scarcely see a single one stirring--though,\r\nperhaps, under your feet there would be millions going and returning\r\nby a thousand different ways. Unless I possessed the power of Asmodeus\r\nin _Le Diable Boiteux_, of showing you their houses and covered ways\r\nwith their roofs removed, you would return home as wise as you came;\r\nfor these little busy creatures are taught by Providence always to work\r\nunder cover. If they have to travel over a rock or up a tree, they\r\nvault with a coping of earth the route they mean to pursue, and they\r\nform subterranean paths and tunnels, some of a diameter wider than the\r\nbore of a large cannon, on all sides from their habitation to their\r\nvarious objects of attack; or which sloping down (for they cannot well\r\nmount a surface quite perpendicular) penetrate to the depth of three\r\nor four feet under their nests into the earth, till they arrive at a\r\nsoil proper to be used in the erection of their buildings. Were they,\r\nindeed, to expose themselves, the race would soon be annihilated by\r\ntheir innumerable enemies. This circumstance has deceived the author\r\nof the MS. account of those in Ceylon, who, speaking of the nests of\r\nthese insects in that island, which he describes as twelve feet high,\r\nobserves, that \"they may be considered as a large city, which contains\r\na great number of houses, and these houses an infinite number of\r\ncells or apartments:----these cells appear to me to communicate with\r\neach other, but not the houses. I have convinced myself, by bringing\r\ntogether the broken walls of one of the cavities of the nest or cone,\r\nthat it does not communicate with any other, nor _with the exterior_ of\r\nthe cone--a very curious circumstance, which I will not undertake to\r\nexplain. Other cavities communicate by a very narrow tunnel.\" By not\r\nlooking for subterranean communications, he was probably led into this\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nYou have before heard of their diligence in building. Does any accident\r\nhappen to their various structures, or are they dislodged from any\r\nof their covered ways, they are still more active and expeditious in\r\nrepairing. Getting out of sight as soon as possible,--and they run as\r\nfast or faster than any insect of their size,--in a single night they\r\nwill restore a gallery of three or four yards in length. If, attacking\r\nthe nest, you divide it in halves, leaving the royal chamber, and thus\r\nlay open thousands of apartments, all will be shut up with their sheets\r\nof clay by the next morning;--nay, even if the whole be demolished,\r\nprovided the king and the queen be left, every interstice between the\r\nruins, at which either cold or wet can possibly enter, will be covered,\r\nand in a year the building will be raised nearly to its pristine size\r\nand grandeur.\r\n\r\nBesides building and repairing, a great deal of their time is\r\noccupied in making necessary alterations in their mansion and its\r\napproaches. The royal presence-chamber, as the female increases in\r\nsize, must be gradually enlarged, the nurseries must be removed to a\r\ngreater distance, the chambers and exterior of the nest receive daily\r\naccessions to provide for a daily increasing population--and the\r\ndirection of their covered ways must often be varied, when the old\r\nstock of provision is exhausted and new discovered.\r\n\r\nThe collection of provisions for the use of the colony is another\r\nemployment, which necessarily calls for incessant attention: these\r\nto the naked eye appear like raspings of wood;--and they are, as\r\nyou have seen, great destroyers of timber, whether wrought or\r\nunwrought:--but when examined by the microscope, they are found to\r\nconsist chiefly of gums and the inspissated juices of plants, which,\r\nformed into little masses, are stored up in magazines made of clay.\r\n\r\nWhen any one is bold enough to attack their nest and make a breach\r\nin its walls, the labourers, who are incapable of fighting, retire\r\nwithin, and give place to another description of its inhabitants, whose\r\noffice it is to defend the fortress when assailed by enemies:--these,\r\nas observed before, are the neuters or soldiers. If the breach be\r\nmade in a slight part of the building, one of these comes out to\r\nreconnoitre; he then retires and gives the alarm. Two or three others\r\nnext appear, scrambling as fast as they can one after the other;--to\r\nthese succeed a large body, who rush forth with as much speed as the\r\nbreach will permit, their numbers continually increasing during the\r\nattack. It is not easy to describe the rage and fury by which these\r\ndiminutive heroes seem actuated. In their haste they frequently miss\r\ntheir hold, and tumble down the sides of their hill: they soon,\r\nhowever, recover themselves, and, being blind, bite every thing they\r\nrun against. If the attack proceeds, the bustle and agitation increase\r\nto a ten-fold degree, and their fury is raised to its highest pitch.\r\nWo to him whose hands or legs they can come at! for they will make\r\ntheir fanged jaws meet at the very first stroke, drawing as much blood\r\nas will counterpoise their whole body, and never quitting their hold,\r\neven though they are pulled limb from limb. The naked legs of the\r\nNegroes expose them frequently to this injury; and the stockings of the\r\nEuropean are not sufficient to defend him.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if, after the first attack, you get a little\r\nout of the way, giving them no further interruption, supposing the\r\nassailant of their citadel is gone beyond their reach, in less than\r\nhalf an hour they will retire into the nest; and before they have all\r\nentered, you will see the labourers in motion, hastening in various\r\ndirections towards the breach, every one carrying in his mouth a mass\r\nof mortar half as big as his body[47], ready tempered:--this mortar\r\nis made of the finer parts of the gravel, which they probably select\r\nin the subterranean pits or passages before described, which, worked\r\nup to a proper consistence, hardens to the solid substance resembling\r\nstone, of which their nests are constructed. As fast as they come up,\r\neach sticks its burthen upon the breach; and this is done with so\r\nmuch regularity and dispatch, that although thousands, nay millions,\r\nare employed, they never appear to embarrass or interrupt one\r\nanother. By the united labours of such an infinite host of creatures\r\nthe wall soon rises and the breach is repaired.\r\n\r\nWhile the labourers are thus employed, almost all the soldiers\r\nhave retired quite out of sight, except here and there one, who\r\nsaunters about amongst them, but never assists in the work. One in\r\nparticular places himself close to the wall which they are building;\r\nand turning himself leisurely on all sides, as if to survey the\r\nproceedings, appears to act the part of an overseer of the works.\r\nEvery now and then, at the interval of a minute or two, by lifting\r\nup his head and striking with his forceps upon the wall of the nest,\r\nhe makes a particular noise, which is answered by a loud hiss from\r\nall the labourers, and appears to be a signal for dispatch; for,\r\nevery time it is heard, they may be seen to redouble their pace, and\r\napply to their work with increased diligence. Renew the attack, and\r\nthis amusing scene will be repeated:--in rush the labourers, all\r\ndisappearing in a few seconds, and out march the military as numerous\r\nand vindictive as before.--When all is once more quiet, the busy\r\nlabourers reappear, and resume their work, and the soldiers vanish.\r\nRepeat the experiment a hundred times, and the same will always be\r\nthe result;--you will never find, be the peril or emergency ever so\r\ngreat, that one order attempts to fight, or the other to work.\r\n\r\nYou have seen how solicitous the Termites are to move and work under\r\ncover and concealed from observation; this, however, is not always\r\nthe case;--there is a species larger than _T. bellicosus_, whose\r\nproceedings I have been principally describing, which Mr. Smeathman\r\ncalls the marching Termes (_Termes Viarum_). He was once passing\r\nthrough a thick forest, when on a sudden a loud hiss, like that of\r\nserpents, struck him with alarm. The next step produced a repetition\r\nof the sound, which he then recognised to be that of white ants;\r\nyet he was surprised at seeing none of their hills or covered ways.\r\nFollowing the noise, to his great astonishment and delight he saw an\r\narmy of these creatures emerging from a hole in the ground; their\r\nnumber was prodigious, and they marched with the utmost celerity.\r\nWhen they had proceeded about a yard they divided into two columns,\r\nchiefly composed of labourers, about fifteen abreast, following each\r\nother in close order, and going straight forward. Here and there was\r\nseen a soldier, carrying his vast head with apparent difficulty,\r\nand looking like an ox in a flock of sheep, who marched on in the\r\nsame manner. At the distance of a foot or two from the columns many\r\nother soldiers were to be seen, standing still or pacing about as if\r\nupon the look-out, lest some enemy should suddenly surprise their\r\nunwarlike comrades;--other soldiers, which was the most extraordinary\r\nand amusing part of the scene, having mounted some plants and placed\r\nthemselves on the points of their leaves, elevated from ten to\r\nfifteen inches from the ground, hung over the army marching below,\r\nand by striking their forceps upon the leaf, produced at intervals\r\nthe noise before mentioned. To this signal the whole army returned a\r\nhiss, and obeyed it by increasing their pace. The soldiers at these\r\nsignal-stations sat quite still during the intervals of silence,\r\nexcept now and then making a slight turn of the head, and seemed\r\nas solicitous to keep their posts as regular sentinels. The two\r\ncolumns of this army united after continuing separate for twelve or\r\nfifteen paces, having in no part been above three yards asunder, and\r\nthen descended into the earth by two or three holes. Mr. Smeathman\r\ncontinued watching them for above an hour, during which time their\r\nnumbers appeared neither to increase nor diminish:--the soldiers,\r\nhowever, who quitted the line of march and acted as sentinels, became\r\nmuch more numerous before he quitted the spot. The larvæ and neuters\r\nof this species are furnished with eyes.\r\n\r\nThe societies of _Termes lucifugus_, discovered by Latreille at\r\nBourdeaux, are very numerous; but instead of erecting artificial\r\nnests, they make their lodgement in the trunks of pines and oaks,\r\nwhere the branches diverge from the tree. They eat the wood the\r\nnearest the bark, or the alburnum, without attacking the interior,\r\nand bore a vast number of holes and irregular galleries. That part\r\nof the wood appears moist, and is covered with little gelatinous\r\nparticles, not unlike gum-arabic. These insects seem to be furnished\r\nwith an acid of a very penetrating odour, which perhaps is useful\r\nto them for softening the wood[48]. The soldiers in these societies\r\nare as about one to twenty-five of the labourers[49]. The anonymous\r\nauthor of the observations on the Termites of Ceylon seems to have\r\ndiscovered a sentry-box in his nests. \"I found,\" says he, \"in a very\r\nsmall cell in the middle of the solid mass, (a cell about half an\r\ninch in height, and very narrow,) a larva with an enormous head.--Two\r\nof these individuals were in the same cell:--one of the two seemed\r\nplaced as sentinel at the entrance of the cell. I amused myself\r\nby forcing the door two or three times;--the sentinel immediately\r\nappeared, and only retreated when the door was on the point to be\r\nstopped up, which was done in three minutes by the labourers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hope this account has reconciled you in some degree to the\r\ndestructive Termites:--I shall next introduce you to social insects,\r\nconcerning most of which you have probably conceived a more\r\nfavourable opinion;--I mean those which constitute the second class\r\nof perfect societies, whose workers are not larvæ, but neuters.\r\nThese all belong to the _Hymenoptera_ order of Linné:--there are\r\nfour kinds of insects in this order, (which you will find as fertile\r\nin the instructors of mankind, as you have seen it to be in our\r\nbenefactors,) that, varying considerably from each other in their\r\nproceedings as social animals, separately merit your attention:\r\nnamely, ants, wasps and hornets, humble-bees, and the hive-bee. I\r\nbegin with the first.\r\n\r\nFull of interesting traits as are the history and economy of the\r\nwhite-ants, and however earnestly they may induce you to wish you\r\ncould be a spectator of them, yet they scarcely exceed those of an\r\nindustrious tribe of insects, which are constantly passing under our\r\neye. The _ant_ has attracted universal notice, and been celebrated\r\nfrom the earliest ages, both by sacred and profane writers, as a\r\npattern of prudence, foresight, wisdom, and diligence. Upon Solomon's\r\ntestimony in their favour I have enlarged before; and for those of\r\nother ancient writers, I must refer you to the learned Bochart, who\r\nhas collected them in his _Hierozoicon_.\r\n\r\nIn reading what the ancients say on this subject, we must be careful,\r\nhowever, to separate truth from error, or we shall attribute much\r\nmore to ants than of right belongs to them. Who does not smile when\r\nhe reads of ants that emulate the wolf in size, the dog in shape, the\r\nlion in its feet, and the leopard in its skin; ants, whose employment\r\nis to mine for gold, and from whose vengeance the furtive Indian is\r\nconstrained to fly on the swift camel's back[50]? But when we find\r\nthe writers of all nations and ages unite in affirming, that, having\r\ndeprived it of the power of vegetating, ants store up grain in their\r\nnests, we feel disposed to give larger credit to an assertion, which,\r\nat first sight, seems to savour more of fact than of fable, and does\r\nnot attribute more sagacity and foresight to these insects than\r\nin other instances they are found to possess. Writers in general,\r\ntherefore, who have considered this subject, and some even of very\r\nlate date, have taken it for granted that the ancients were correct\r\nin this notion. But when observers of nature began to examine the\r\nmanners and economy of these creatures more narrowly, it was found,\r\nat least with respect to the European species of ants, that no such\r\nhoards of grain were made by them, and, in fact, that they had no\r\nmagazines in their nests in which provisions of any kind were stored\r\nup. It was therefore surmised that the ancients, observing them\r\ncarry about their _pupæ_, which in shape, size, and colour, not a\r\nlittle resemble a grain of corn, and the ends of which they sometimes\r\npull open to let out the inclosed insect, mistook the one for the\r\nother, and this action for depriving the grain of the corculum. Mr.\r\nGould, our countryman, was one of the first historians of the ant,\r\nwho discovered that they did not store up corn; and since his time\r\nnaturalists have generally subscribed to that opinion.\r\n\r\nTill the manners of exotic ants are more accurately explored, it\r\nwould, however, be rash to affirm that no ants have magazines of\r\nprovisions; for although, during the cold of our winters in this\r\ncountry, they remain in a state of torpidity, and have no need of\r\nfood, yet in warmer regions, during the rainy seasons, when they\r\nare probably confined to their nests, a store of provisions may be\r\nnecessary for them. Even in northern climates, against wet seasons,\r\nthey may provide in this way for their sustenance and that of the\r\nyoung brood, which, as Mr. Smeathman observes, are very voracious,\r\nand cannot bear to be long deprived of their food; else why do ants\r\ncarry worms, living insects, and many other such things into their\r\nnests? Solomon's lesson to the sluggard has been generally adduced\r\nas a strong confirmation of the ancient opinion: it can, however,\r\nonly relate to the species of a warm climate, the habits of which,\r\nas I have just observed, are probably different from those of a cold\r\none;--so that his words, as commonly interpreted, may be perfectly\r\ncorrect and consistent with nature, and yet be not at all applicable\r\nto the species that are indigenous to Europe. But I think, if\r\nSolomon's words are properly considered, it will be found that this\r\ninterpretation has been fathered upon them, rather than fairly\r\ndeduced from them. He does not affirm that the ant which he proposes\r\nto his sluggard as an example, laid up in her magazines stores of\r\ngrain: \"Go to the ant thou sluggard, consider her ways and be wise;\r\nwhich, having neither captain, overseer, nor ruler, prepares her\r\nbread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.\" These\r\nwords may very well be interpreted simply to mean, that the ant, with\r\ncommendable prudence and foresight, makes use of the proper seasons\r\nto collect a supply of provision sufficient for her purposes. There\r\nis not a word in them implying that she stores up grain or other\r\nprovision. She prepares her bread, and gathers her food,--namely,\r\nsuch food as is suited to her,--in summer and harvest,--that is,\r\nwhen it is most plentiful,--and thus shows her wisdom and prudence\r\nby using the advantages offered to her. The words thus interpreted,\r\nwhich they may be without any violence, will apply to our European\r\nspecies as well as to those that are not indigenous.\r\n\r\nI shall now bid farewell to the ancients, and proceed to lay before\r\nyou what the observations of modern authors have enabled me to add\r\nto the history of ants:--the principal of these are Leeuwenhoek,\r\nSwammerdam (who was the first that had recourse to artificial means\r\nfor observing their proceedings), Linné, Bonnet, and especially the\r\nillustrious Swedish entomologist De Geer. Gould also, who, though\r\nno systematical naturalist, was a man of sense and observation, has\r\nthrown great light upon the history of ants, and anticipated several\r\nof what are accounted the discoveries of more modern writers on\r\nthis subject[51]. Latreille's _Natural History of Ants_ is likewise\r\nextremely valuable, not only as giving a systematic arrangement and\r\ndescriptions of the species, but as concentrating the accounts of\r\npreceding authors, and adding several interesting facts _ex proprio\r\npenu_. The great historiographer of ants, however, is M. P. Huber;\r\nwho has lately published a most admirable and interesting work upon\r\nthem, in which he has far outstripped all his predecessors.--Such are\r\nthe sources from which the following account of ants is principally\r\ndrawn, intermixed with which you will find some occasional\r\nobservations,--which your partiality to your friend may, perhaps,\r\ninduce you to think not wholly devoid of interest,--that it has been\r\nmy fortune to make.\r\n\r\nThe societies of ants, as also of other _Hymenoptera_, differ\r\nfrom those of the Termites in having inactive larvæ and pupæ, the\r\nneuters or workers combining in themselves both the military and\r\ncivil functions. Besides the helpless larvæ and pupæ, which have\r\nno locomotive powers, these societies consist of females, males,\r\nand workers. The office of the _females_, at their first exclusion\r\ndistinguished by a pair of ample wings, (which however, as you have\r\nheard, they soon cast,) is the foundation of new colonies, and\r\nthe furnishing of a constant supply of eggs for the maintenance\r\nof the population in the old nests as well as in the new. These\r\nare usually the least numerous part of the community[52]. The\r\noffice of the _males_, which are also winged, and at the time of\r\nswarming are extremely numerous, is merely the impregnation of the\r\nfemales: after the season for this is passed, they die. Upon the\r\n_workers_[53] devolves, except in nascent colonies, all the work,\r\nas well as the defence of the community, of which they are the most\r\nnumerous portion. In some societies of ants the workers are of two\r\ndimensions.--In the nests of _F. rufa_ and _flava_ such were observed\r\nby Gould, the size of one exceeding that of the other about one\r\nthird[54]. (In my specimens, the large workers of _F. rufa_ are\r\nnearly three times, and of _F. flava_ twice, the size of the small\r\nones.) All were equally engaged in the labours of the colony. Large\r\nworkers were also noticed by M. P. Huber in the nests of _Polyergus\r\nrufescens_[55], but he could not ascertain their office.\r\n\r\nHaving introduced you to the individuals of which the associations\r\nof ants consist, I shall now advert to the principal events of their\r\nhistory, relating first the fates of the _males_ and _females_. In\r\nthe warm days that occur from the end of July to the beginning of\r\nSeptember, and sometimes later, the habitations of the various species\r\nof ants may be seen to swarm with winged insects, which are the males\r\nand females, preparing to quit for ever the scene of their nativity and\r\neducation. Every thing is in motion--and the silver wings contrasted\r\nwith the jet bodies which compose the animated mass, add a degree of\r\nsplendour to the interesting scene. The bustle increases, till at\r\nlength the males rise, as it were by a general impulse, into the air,\r\nand the females accompany them. The whole swarm alternately rises and\r\nfalls with a slow movement to the height of about ten feet, the males\r\nflying obliquely with a rapid zigzag motion, and the females, though\r\nthey follow the general movement of the column, appearing suspended in\r\nthe air, like balloons, seemingly with no individual motion, and having\r\ntheir heads turned towards the wind.\r\n\r\nSometimes the swarms of a whole district unite their infinite myriads,\r\nand, seen at a distance, produce an effect resembling the flashing\r\nof an aurora borealis. Rising with incredible velocity in distinct\r\ncolumns, they soar above the clouds. Each column looks like a kind\r\nof slender net-work, and has a tremulous undulating motion, which\r\nhas been observed to be produced by the regular alternate rising and\r\nfalling just alluded to. The noise emitted by myriads and myriads of\r\nthese creatures does not exceed the hum of a single wasp. The slightest\r\nzephyr disperses them; and if in their progress they chance to be over\r\nyour head, if you walk slowly on, they will accompany you, and regulate\r\ntheir motions by yours. The females continue sailing majestically\r\nin the centre of these numberless males, who are all candidates for\r\ntheir favour, each till some fortunate lover darts upon her, and,\r\nas the Roman youth did the Sabine virgins, drags his bride from the\r\nsportive crowd, and the nuptials are consummated in mid-air; though\r\nsometimes the union takes place on the summit of plants, but rarely in\r\nthe nests[56]. After this _danse de l'amour_ is celebrated, the males\r\ndisappear, probably dying, or becoming, with many of the females, the\r\nprey of birds or fish[57]; for, since they do not return to the nest,\r\nthey cannot be destroyed, as some have supposed, like the drone bees,\r\nby the neuters. That many, both males and females, become the prey of\r\nfish, I am enabled to assert from my own observation.--In the beginning\r\nof August 1812, I was going up the Orford river in Suffolk, in a\r\nrow-boat, in the evening, when my attention was caught by an infinite\r\nnumber of winged ants, both males and females, at which the fish were\r\nevery where darting, floating alive upon the surface of the water.\r\nWhile passing the river, these had probably been precipitated into it,\r\neither by the wind, or by a heavy shower which had just fallen. And M.\r\nHuber after the same event observed the earth strewed with females that\r\nhad lost their wings, all of which could not form colonies[58].\r\n\r\nCaptain Haverfield, R. N. gave me an account of an extraordinary\r\nappearance of ants observed by him in the Medway, in the autumn\r\nof 1814, when he was first-lieutenant of the Clorinde--which is\r\nconfirmed by the following letter addressed by the surgeon of that\r\nship, now Dr. Bromley, to Mr. MacLeay:\r\n\r\n\"In September 1814, being on the deck of the hulk to the Clorinde, my\r\nattention was drawn to the water by the first-lieutenant (Haverfield)\r\nobserving there was something black floating down with the tide.\r\nOn looking with a glass, I discovered they were insects.--The boat\r\nwas sent, and brought a bucket full of them on board;--they proved\r\nto be a large species of ant, and extended from the upper part of\r\nSalt-pan reach out towards the Great Nore, a distance of five or six\r\nmiles. The column appeared to be in breadth eight or ten feet, and in\r\nheight about six inches, which I suppose must have been from their\r\nresting one upon another.\" Purchas seems to have witnessed a similar\r\nphenomenon on shore. \"Other sorts (of ants),\" says he, \"there are\r\nmany, of which some become winged and fill the air with swarms, which\r\nsometimes happens in England. On Bartholomew 1613 I was in the island\r\nof Foulness on our Essex shore, where were such clouds of these\r\nflying pismires, that we could no where fly from them, but they\r\nfilled our clothes; yea the floors of some houses where they fell\r\nwere in a manner covered with a black carpet of creeping ants; which\r\nthey say drown themselves about that time of the year in the sea[59].\"\r\n\r\nThese ants were winged:--whence, in the first instance here related,\r\nthis immense column came was not ascertained. From the numbers here\r\nagglomerated, one would think that all the ant-hills of the counties\r\nof Kent and Surrey could scarcely have furnished a sufficient number\r\nof males and females to form it.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Sir Augustus Frazer, of the Horse Artillery, was\r\nsurveying on the 6th of October 1813 the scene of the battle of the\r\nPyrenees from the summit of the mountain called Pena de Aya, or Les\r\nQuatre Couronnes, he and his friends were enveloped by a swarm of\r\nants, so numerous as entirely to intercept their view, so that they\r\nwere glad to remove to another station, in order to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nThe females that escape from the injury of the elements and their\r\nvarious enemies, become the founders of new colonies, doing all the\r\nwork, as I have related in a former letter, that is usually done by\r\nthe neuters[60]. M. P. Huber has found incipient colonies, in which\r\nwere only a few workers engaged with their mother in the care of a\r\nsmall number of larvæ; and M. Perrot, his friend, once discovered a\r\nsmall nest, occupied by a solitary female, who was attending upon\r\nfour pupæ only. Such is the foundation and first establishment of\r\nthose populous nations of ants with which we every where meet.\r\n\r\nBut though the majority of females produced in a nest probably thus\r\ndesert it, all are not allowed this liberty. The prudent workers are\r\ntaught by their instinct that the existence of their community depends\r\nupon the presence of a sufficient number of females. Some therefore\r\nthat are fecundated in or near the spot they forcibly detain, pulling\r\noff their wings, and keeping them prisoners till they are ready to\r\nlay their eggs, or are reconciled to their fate. De Geer in a nest\r\nof _F. rufa_ observed that the workers compelled some females that\r\nwere come out of the nest, to re-enter it[61]; and from M. P. Huber\r\nwe learn that, being seized at the moment of fecundation, they are\r\nconducted into the interior of the formicary, when they become entirely\r\ndependent upon the neuters, who hanging pertinaciously to each leg\r\nprevent their going out, but at the same time attend upon them with\r\nthe greatest care, feeding them regularly, and conducting them where\r\nthe temperature is suitable to them, but never quitting them a single\r\nmoment. By degrees these females become reconciled to their fate, and\r\nlose all desire of making their escape;--their abdomen enlarges, and\r\nthey are no longer detained as prisoners, yet each is still attended\r\nby a body-guard--a single ant, which always accompanies her, and\r\nprevents her wants.--Its station is remarkable, it being mounted upon\r\nher abdomen, with its posterior legs upon the ground. These sentinels\r\nare constantly relieved: and to watch the moment when the female begins\r\nthe important work of oviposition, and carry off the eggs, of which she\r\nlays four or five thousand or more in the course of the year, seems to\r\nbe their principal office.\r\n\r\nWhen the female is acknowledged as a mother, the workers begin to pay\r\nher a homage very similar to that which the bees render to their queen.\r\nAll press round her, offer her food, conduct her by her mandibles\r\nthrough the difficult or steep passages of the formicary; nay, they\r\nsometimes even carry her about their city;--she is then suspended upon\r\ntheir jaws, the ends of which are crossed; and, being coiled up like\r\nthe tongue of a butterfly, she is packed so close as to incommode the\r\ncarrier but little. When she sets her down, others surround and caress\r\nher, one after another tapping her on the head with their antennæ. \"In\r\nwhatever apartment,\" says Gould, \"a queen condescends to be present,\r\nshe commands obedience and respect. An universal gladness spreads\r\nitself through the whole cell, which is expressed by particular acts of\r\njoy and exultation. They have a particular way of skipping, leaping,\r\nand standing upon their hind-legs, and prancing with the others. These\r\nfrolics they make use of, both to congratulate each other when they\r\nmeet, and to show their regard for the queen; some of them gently walk\r\nover her, others dance round her; she is generally encircled with a\r\ncluster of attendants, who, if you separate them from her, soon collect\r\nthemselves into a body, and inclose her in the midst[62].\" Nay, even\r\nif she dies, as if they were unwilling to believe it, they continue\r\nsometimes for months the same attentions to her, and treat her with the\r\nsame courtly formality as if she were alive, and they will brush her\r\nand lick her incessantly[63].\r\n\r\nThis homage paid by the workers to their queens, according to Gould,\r\nis temporary and local;--when she has laid eggs in any cell, their\r\nattentions, he observed, seemed to relax, and she became unsettled\r\nand uneasy. In the summer months she is to be met with in various\r\napartments in the colony; and eggs also are to be seen in several\r\nplaces, which induced him to believe that, having deposited a parcel\r\nin one, she retires to another for the same purpose, thus frequently\r\nchanging her situation and attendants. As there are always a number\r\nof lodgements void of eggs but full of ants, she is never at a loss\r\nfor an agreeable station and submissive retinue: and by the time she\r\nhas gone her rounds in this manner, the eggs first laid are brought\r\nto perfection, and her old attendants are glad to receive her again.\r\nYet this inattention after oviposition is not invariable; the female\r\nand neuters sometimes unite together in the same cell after the eggs\r\nare laid. On this occasion the workers divide their attention; and\r\nif you disturb them, some will run to the defence of their queen, as\r\nwell as of the eggs, which last, however, are the great objects of\r\ntheir solicitude. This statement differs somewhat from M. Huber's; but\r\ndifferent species vary in their instincts, which will account for this\r\nand similar dissonances in authors who have observed their proceedings.\r\nMr. Gould also noticed but very few females in ant-nests, sometimes\r\nonly one; but M. Huber, who had better opportunities, found several,\r\nwhich he says live very peaceably together, showing none of that spirit\r\nof rivalry so remarkable in the queen bee.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must close my narrative of the life and adventures of male\r\nand female ants; but, as it will be followed by a history of the\r\nstill more interesting proceedings of the _workers_, I think you will\r\nnot regret the exchange. I shall show these to you in many different\r\nviews, under each of which you will find fresh reason to admire\r\nthem and their wonderful instincts. My only fear will be lest you\r\nshould think the picture too highly coloured, and deem it incredible\r\nthat creatures so minute should so far exceed the larger animals in\r\nwisdom, foresight, and sagacity, and make so near an approach in\r\nthese respects to man himself.--My facts, however, are derived from\r\nauthorities so respectable, that I think they will do away any bias\r\nof this kind that you may feel in your mind[64].\r\n\r\nI need not here repeat what I have said in a former letter concerning\r\nthe exemplary attention paid by these kind foster-mothers to\r\nthe young brood of their colonies; nor shall I enlarge upon the\r\nbuilding and nature of their habitations, which have been already\r\nnoticed[65]:--but, without either of these, I have matter enough\r\nto fill the rest of this letter with interesting traits, while I\r\nendeavour to teach you their language, to develop their affections\r\nand passions, and to delineate their virtues;--while I show them\r\nto you when engaged in war, and enable you to accompany them both\r\nin their military expeditions and in their emigrations,--while I\r\nmake you a witness of their indefatigable industry and incessant\r\nlabours,--or invite you to be present, during their hours of\r\nrelaxation, at their sports and amusements.\r\n\r\nThat ants, though they are mute animals, have the means of\r\ncommunicating to each other information of various occurrences, and\r\nuse a kind of language which is mutually understood, will appear\r\nevident from the following facts.\r\n\r\nIf those at the surface of a nest are alarmed, it is wonderful in\r\nhow short a time the alarm spreads through the whole nest. It runs\r\nfrom quarter to quarter; the greatest inquietude seems to possess\r\nthe community; and they carry with all possible dispatch their\r\ntreasures, the larvæ and pupæ, down to the lowest apartments. Amongst\r\nthose species of ants that do not go much from home, sentinels seem\r\nto be stationed at the avenues of their city. Disturbing once the\r\nlittle heaps of earth thrown up at the entrances into the nest of\r\n_F. flava_, which is of this description, I was struck by observing\r\na single ant immediately come out, as if to see what was the matter,\r\nand this three separate times.\r\n\r\nThe _F. herculanea_ inhabits the trunks of hollow trees on the\r\ncontinent, for it has not yet been found in England, upon which\r\nthey are often passing to and fro. M. Huber observed, that when he\r\ndisturbed those that were at the greatest distance from the rest,\r\nthey ran towards them, and, striking their head against them,\r\ncommunicated their cause of fear or anger,--that these, in their\r\nturn, conveyed in the same way the intelligence to others, till the\r\nwhole colony was in a ferment, those neuters which were within the\r\ntree running out in crowds to join their companions in the defence of\r\ntheir habitation. The same signals that excited the courage of the\r\nneuters produced fear in the males and females, which, as soon as the\r\nnews of the danger was thus communicated to them, retreated into the\r\ntree as to an asylum.\r\n\r\nThe legs of one of this gentleman's artificial formicaries were plunged\r\ninto pans of water, to prevent the escape of the ants;--this proved a\r\nsource of great enjoyment to these little beings, for they are a very\r\nthirsty race, and lap water like dogs[66]. One day, when he observed\r\nmany of them tippling very merrily, he was so cruel as to disturb them,\r\nwhich sent most of the ants in a fright to the nest; but some more\r\nthirsty than the rest continued their potations. Upon this, one of\r\nthose that had retreated returns to inform his thoughtless companions\r\nof their danger; one he pushes with his jaws; another he strikes first\r\nupon the belly, and then upon the breast; and so obliges three of them\r\nto leave off their carousing, and march homewards; but the fourth, more\r\nresolute to drink it out, is not to be discomfited, and pays not the\r\nleast regard to the kind blows with which his compeer, solicitous for\r\nhis safety, repeatedly belabours him:--at length, determined to have\r\nhis way, he seizes him by one of his hind-legs, and gives him a violent\r\npull:--upon this, leaving his liquor, the loiterer turns round, and\r\nopening his threatening jaws with every appearance of anger, goes very\r\ncoolly to drinking again; but his monitor, without further ceremony,\r\nrushing before him, seizes him by his jaws, and at last drags him off\r\nin triumph to the formicary[67].\r\n\r\nThe language of ants, however, is not confined merely to giving\r\nintelligence of the approach or presence of danger; it is also\r\nco-extensive with all their other occasions for communicating their\r\nideas to each other.\r\n\r\nSome, whose extraordinary history I shall soon relate to you, engage\r\nin military expeditions, and often previously send out spies to\r\ncollect information. These, as soon as they return from exploring the\r\nvicinity, enter the nest; upon which, as if they had communicated\r\ntheir intelligence, the army immediately assembles in the suburbs\r\nof their city, and begins its march towards that quarter whence the\r\nspies had arrived. Upon the march, communications are perpetually\r\nmaking between the van and the rear; and when arrived at the camp\r\nof the enemy, and the battle begins, if necessary, couriers are\r\ndispatched to the formicary for reinforcements[68].\r\n\r\nIf you scatter the ruins of an ant's nest in your apartment, you will\r\nbe furnished with another proof of their language. The ants will take a\r\nthousand different paths, each going by itself, to increase the chance\r\nof discovery; they will meet and cross each other in all directions,\r\nand perhaps will wander long before they can find a spot convenient\r\nfor their reunion. No sooner does any one discover a little chink in\r\nthe floor, through which it can pass below, than it returns to its\r\ncompanions, and, by means of certain motions of its antennæ, makes some\r\nof them comprehend what route they are to pursue to find it, sometimes\r\neven accompanying them to the spot; these, in their turn, become the\r\nguides of others, till all know which way to direct their steps[69].\r\n\r\nIt is well known also, that ants give each other information when\r\nthey have discovered any store of provision. Bradley relates a\r\nstriking instance of this. A nest of ants in a nobleman's garden\r\ndiscovered a closet, many yards within the house, in which conserves\r\nwere kept, which they constantly attended till the nest was\r\ndestroyed. Some in their rambles must have first discovered this\r\ndepôt of sweets, and informed the rest of it. It is remarkable that\r\nthey always went to it by the same track, scarcely varying an inch\r\nfrom it, though they had to pass through two apartments; nor could\r\nthe sweeping and cleaning of the rooms discomfit them, or cause them\r\nto pursue a different route[70].\r\n\r\nHere may be related a very amusing experiment of Gould's. Having\r\ndeposited several colonies of ants (_F. fusca_) in flower-pots, he\r\nplaced them in some earthen pans full of water, which prevented then\r\nfrom making excursions from their nest. When they had been accustomed\r\nsome days to this imprisonment, he fastened small threads to the\r\nupper part of the pots, and extending them over the water pans fixed\r\nthem in the ground. The sagacious ants soon found out that by these\r\nbridges they could escape from their moated castle. The discovery was\r\ncommunicated to the whole society, and in a short time the threads\r\nwere filled with trains of busy workers passing to and fro[71].\r\n\r\nLigon's account of the ants in Barbadoes affords another most\r\nconvincing proof of this:--as he has told his tale in a very lively\r\nand interesting manner, I shall give it nearly in his own words.\r\n\r\n\"The next of these moving little animals are ants or pismires; and\r\nthese are but of a small size, but great in industry; and that which\r\ngives them means to attain to this end is, they have all one soul.\r\nIf I should say they are here or there, I should do them wrong,\r\nfor they are every where; under ground, where any hollow or loose\r\nearth is; amongst the roots of trees; upon the bodies, branches,\r\nleaves and fruit of all trees; in all places without the houses and\r\nwithin; upon the sides, walls, windows, and roofs without; and on the\r\nfloors, side walls, ceilings, and windows within; tables, cupboards,\r\nbeds, stools, all are covered with them, so that they are a kind of\r\nubiquitaries.----We sometimes kill a cockroach, and throw him on the\r\nground; and mark what they will do with him: his body is bigger than\r\na hundred of them, and yet they will find the means to take hold of\r\nhim, and lift him up; and having him above ground, away they carry\r\nhim, and some go by as ready assistants, if any be weary; and some\r\nare the officers that lead and show the way to the hole into which\r\nhe must pass; and if the vancouriers perceive that the body of the\r\ncockroach lies across, and will not pass through the hole or arch\r\nthrough which they mean to carry him, order is given, and the body\r\nturned endwise, and this is done a foot before they come to the hole,\r\nand that without any stop or stay; and this is observable, that they\r\nnever pull contrary ways.--A table being cleared with great care, by\r\nway of experiment, of all the ants that were upon it, and some sugar\r\nbeing put upon it, some, after a circuitous route, were observed to\r\narrive at it, when again departing without tasting the treasure, they\r\nhastened away to inform their friends of their discovery, who upon\r\nthis came by myriads;--and when they are thickest upon the table,\"\r\nsays he, \"clap a large book (or any thing fit for that purpose) upon\r\nthem, so hard as to kill all that are under it; and when you have\r\ndone so, take away the book, and leave them to themselves but a\r\nquarter of an hour, and when you come again, you shall find all those\r\nbodies carried away. Other trials we make of their ingenuity, as\r\nthis:--Take a pewter dish, and fill it half full of water, into which\r\nput a little gally-pot filled with sugar, and the ants will presently\r\nfind it and come upon the table; but when they perceive it environed\r\nwith water, they try about the brims of the dish where the gally-pot\r\nis nearest; and there the most venturous amongst them commits himself\r\nto the water, though he be conscious how ill a swimmer he is, and is\r\ndrowned in the adventure: the next is not warned by his example, but\r\nventures too, and is alike drowned; and many more, so that there is\r\na small foundation of their bodies to venture; and then they come\r\nfaster than ever, and so make a bridge of their own bodies[72].\"\r\n\r\nThe fact being certain, that ants impart their ideas to each other,\r\nwe are next led to inquire by what means this is accomplished. It\r\ndoes not appear that, like the bees, they emit any significative\r\nsounds; their language, therefore, must consist of signs or gestures,\r\nsome of which I shall now detail. In communicating their fear or\r\nexpressing their anger, they run from one to another in a semicircle,\r\nand strike with their head or jaws the trunk or abdomen of the ant\r\nto which they mean to give information of any subject of alarm. But\r\nthose remarkable organs, their antennæ, are the principal instruments\r\nof their speech, if I may so call it, supplying the place both of\r\nvoice and words. When the military ants before alluded to go upon\r\ntheir expeditions, and are out of the formicary, previously to\r\nsetting off, they touch each other on the trunk with their antennæ\r\nand forehead;--this is the signal for marching; for, as soon as any\r\none has received it, he is immediately in motion. When they have any\r\ndiscovery to communicate, they strike with them those that they meet\r\nin a particularly impressive manner.--If a hungry ant wants to be\r\nfed, it touches with its two antennæ, moving them very rapidly, those\r\nof the individual from which it expects its meal:--and not only ants\r\nunderstand this language, but even Aphides and Cocci, which are the\r\nmilch kine of our little pismires, do the same, and will yield them\r\ntheir saccharine fluid at the touch of these imperative organs. The\r\nhelpless larvæ also of the ants are informed by the same means when\r\nthey may open their mouths to receive their food.\r\n\r\nNext to their language, and scarcely different from it, are the\r\nmodes by which they express their affections and aversions. Whether\r\nants, with man and some of the larger animals, experience any thing\r\nlike attachment to individuals, is not easily ascertained; but that\r\nthey feel the full force of the sentiment which we term patriotism,\r\nor the love of the community to which they belong, is evident from\r\nthe whole series of their proceedings, which all tend to promote\r\nthe general good. Distress or difficulty falling upon any member of\r\ntheir society, generally excites their sympathy, and they do their\r\nutmost to relieve it. M. Latreille once cut off the antennæ of an\r\nant; and its companions, evidently pitying its sufferings, anointed\r\nthe wounded part with a drop of transparent fluid from their mouth:\r\nand whoever attends to what is going forward in the neighbourhood of\r\none of their nests, will be pleased to observe the readiness with\r\nwhich they seem disposed to assist each other in difficulties. When\r\na burthen is too heavy for one, another will soon come to ease it\r\nof part of the weight; and if one is threatened with an attack, all\r\nhasten to the spot, to join in repelling it.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction they express at meeting after absence is very\r\nstriking, and gives some degree of individuality to their attachment.\r\nM. Huber witnessed the gesticulations of some ants, originally\r\nbelonging to the same nest, that, having been entirely separated from\r\neach other four months, were afterwards brought together. Though\r\nthis was equal to one-fourth of their existence as perfect insects,\r\nthey immediately recognised each other, saluted mutually with their\r\nantennæ, and united once more to form one family.\r\n\r\nThey are also ever intent to promote each other's welfare, and ready\r\nto share with their absent companions any good thing they may meet\r\nwith. Those that go abroad feed those which remain in the nest; and\r\nif they discover any stock of favourite food, they inform the whole\r\ncommunity, as we have seen above, and teach them the way to it. M.\r\nHuber, for a particular reason, having produced heat, by means of\r\na flambeau in a certain part of an artificial formicary, the ants\r\nthat happened to be in that quarter, after enjoying it for a time,\r\nhastened to convey the welcome intelligence to their compatriots,\r\nwhom they even carried suspended upon their jaws (their usual mode\r\nof transporting each other) to the spot, till hundreds might be seen\r\nthus laden with their friends.\r\n\r\nIf ants feel the force of love, they are equally susceptible of the\r\nemotions of anger; and when they are menaced or attacked, no insects\r\nshow a greater degree of it. Providence, moreover, has furnished\r\nthem with weapons and faculties which render it extremely formidable\r\nto their insect enemies, and sometimes, as I have related on a\r\nformer occasion, a great annoyance to man himself[73]. Two strong\r\nmandibles arm their mouth, with which they sometimes fix themselves\r\nso obstinately to the object of their attack, that they will sooner\r\nbe torn limb from limb than let go their hold;--and after their\r\nbattles, the head of a conquered enemy may often be seen suspended\r\nto the antennæ or legs of the victor,--a trophy of his valour,\r\nwhich, however troublesome, he will be compelled to carry about\r\nwith him to the day of his death. Their abdomen is also furnished\r\nwith a poison-bag (_Ioterium_), in which is secreted a powerful and\r\nvenomous fluid, long celebrated in chemical researches, and once\r\ncalled _formic acid_, though now considered a modification of the\r\n_acetic_ and _malic_[74]; which, when their enemy is beyond the reach\r\nof their mandibles (I speak here particularly of the hill-ant, or\r\n_F. rufa_), standing erect on their hind-legs, they ejaculate from\r\ntheir anus with considerable force, so that from the surface of the\r\nnest ascends a shower of poison, exhaling a strong sulphureous odour,\r\nsufficient to overpower or repel any insect or small animal. Such is\r\nthe fury of some species, that with the acid, according to Gould[75],\r\nthey sometimes partly eject, drawing it back however directly, the\r\npoison-bag itself. If a stick be stuck into one of the nests of the\r\nhill-ant, it is so saturated with the acid as to retain the scent for\r\nmany hours. A more formidable weapon arms the species of the genus\r\n_Myrmica_, Latr.; for, besides the poison-bag, they are furnished\r\nwith a sting; and their aspect is also often rendered peculiarly\r\nrevolting, by the extraordinary length of their jaws, and by the\r\nspines which defend their head and trunk.\r\n\r\nBut weapons without valour are of but little use; and this is\r\none distinguishing feature of our pygmy race. Their courage and\r\npertinacity are unconquerable, and often sublimed into the most\r\ninconceivable rage and fury. It makes no difference to them whether\r\nthey attack a mite or an elephant; and man himself instills no terror\r\ninto their warlike breasts. Point your finger towards any individual\r\nof _F. rufa_,--instead of running away, it instantly faces about,\r\nand, that it may make the most of itself, stiffening its legs into a\r\nnearly straight line, it gives its body the utmost elevation it is\r\ncapable of; and thus\r\n\r\n          \"Collecting all its might dilated stands\"\r\n\r\nprepared to repel your attack. Put your finger a little nearer,\r\nit immediately opens its jaws to bite you, and rearing upon its\r\nhind-legs bends its abdomen between them, to ejaculate its venom into\r\nthe wound[76].\r\n\r\nThis angry people, so well armed and so courageous, we may readily\r\nimagine are not always at peace with their neighbours; causes of\r\ndissension may arise to light the flame of war between the inhabitants\r\nof nests not far distant from each other. To these little bustling\r\ncreatures a square foot of earth is a territory worth contending\r\nfor;--their droves of Aphides equally valuable with the flocks and\r\nherds that cover our plains; and the body of a fly or a beetle, or a\r\ncargo of straws and bits of stick, an acquisition as important as the\r\ntreasures of a Lima fleet to our seamen. Their wars are usually between\r\nnests of different species; sometimes, however, those of the same,\r\nwhen so near as to interfere with and incommode each other, have their\r\nbattles; and with respect to ants of one species, _Myrmica rubra_,\r\ncombats occasionally take place, contrary to the general habits of the\r\ntribe of ants, between those of the same nest. I shall give you some\r\naccount of all these conflicts, beginning with the last. But I must\r\nfirst observe, that the only warriors amongst our ants are the neuters\r\nor workers; the males and females being very peaceable creatures, and\r\nalways glad to get out of harm's way.\r\n\r\nThe wars of the red ant (_M. rubra_) are usually between a small number\r\nof the citizens; and the object, according to Gould, is to get rid of\r\na useless member of the community (it does not argue much in favour\r\nof the humanity of this species if it be by sickness that this member\r\nis disabled), rather than any real civil contest. \"The red colonies,\"\r\nsays this author, \"are the only ones I could ever observe to feed upon\r\ntheir own species. You may frequently discern a party of from five or\r\nsix to twenty surrounding one of their own kind, or even fraternity,\r\nand pulling it to pieces. The ant they attack is generally feeble, and\r\nof a languid complexion, occasioned perhaps by some disorder or other\r\naccident[77].\" I once saw one of these ants dragged out of the nest\r\nby another, without its head; it was still alive, and could crawl\r\nabout. A lively imagination might have fancied that this poor ant was\r\na criminal, condemned by a court of justice to suffer the extreme\r\nsentence of the law. It was more probably, however, a champion that had\r\nbeen decapitated in an unequal combat, unless we admit Gould's idea,\r\nand suppose it to have suffered because it was an unprofitable member\r\nof the community[78]. At another time I found three individuals that\r\nwere fighting with great fury, chained together by their mandibles; one\r\nof these had lost two of the legs of one side, yet it appeared to walk\r\nwell, and was as eager to attack and seize its opponents, as if it was\r\nunhurt. This did not look like languor or sickness.\r\n\r\nThe wars of ants that are not of the same species take place usually\r\nbetween those that differ in size; and the great endeavouring to\r\noppress the small are nevertheless often outnumbered by them, and\r\ndefeated. Their battles have long been celebrated, and the date\r\nof them, as if it were an event of the first importance, has been\r\nformally recorded. Æneas Sylvius, after giving a very circumstantial\r\naccount of one contested with great obstinacy by a great and small\r\nspecies on the trunk of a pear-tree, gravely states, \"This action was\r\nfought in the pontificate of Eugenius the Fourth, in the presence\r\nof Nicholas Pistoriensis, an eminent lawyer, who related the\r\nwhole history of the battle with the greatest fidelity!\" A similar\r\nengagement between great and small ants is recorded by Olaus Magnus,\r\nin which the small ones being victorious are said to have buried the\r\nbodies of their own soldiers, but left those of their giant enemies a\r\nprey to the birds. This event happened previous to the expulsion of\r\nthe tyrant Christiern the Second from Sweden[79].\r\n\r\nM. P. Huber is the only modern author that appears to have been\r\nwitness to these combats. He tells us that, when the great attack the\r\nsmall, they seek to take them by surprise, (probably to avoid their\r\nfastening themselves to their legs,) and, seizing them by the upper\r\npart of the body, they strangle them with their mandibles; but when\r\nthe small have time to foresee the attack, they give notice to their\r\ncompanions, who rush in crowds to their succour. Sometimes, however,\r\nafter suffering a signal defeat, the smaller species are obliged to\r\nshift their quarters, and to seek an establishment more out of the\r\nway of danger. In order to cover their march, many small bodies are\r\nthen posted at a little distance from the nest. As soon as the large\r\nants approach the camp, the foremost sentinels instantly fly at\r\nthem with the greatest rage, a violent struggle ensues, multitudes\r\nof their friends come to their assistance, and, though no match for\r\ntheir enemies singly, by dint of numbers they prevail, and the giant\r\nis either slain or led captive to the hostile camp. The species\r\nwhose proceedings M. Huber observed, were _F. herculanea_ and _F.\r\nsanguinea_, neither of which have yet been discovered in Britain[80].\r\n\r\nBut if you would see more numerous armies engaged, and survey war\r\nin all its forms, you must witness the combats of ants of the same\r\nspecies, you must go into the woods where the hill-ant of Gould\r\n(_F. rufa_) erects its habitations. There you will sometimes behold\r\npopulous and rival cities, like Rome and Carthage, as if they had\r\nvowed each other's destruction, pouring forth their myriads by the\r\nvarious roads that, like rays, diverge on all sides from their\r\nrespective metropolises, to decide by an appeal to arms the fate of\r\ntheir little world. As the exploits of frogs and mice were the theme\r\nof Homer's muse, so, were I gifted like him, might I celebrate on\r\nthis occasion the exhibition of Myrmidonian valour; but, alas! I am\r\nDavus, not Œdipus; you must therefore rest contented, if I do my best\r\nin plain prose; and I trust you will not complain if, being unable to\r\nascertain the name of any one of my heroes, my _Myrmidonomachia_ be\r\nperfectly anonymous.\r\n\r\nFigure to yourself two of these cities equal in size and population,\r\nand situated about a hundred paces from each other; observe their\r\ncountless numbers, equal to the population of two mighty empires.\r\nThe whole space which separates them for the breadth of twenty-four\r\ninches appears alive with prodigious crowds of their inhabitants. The\r\narmies meet midway between their respective habitations, and there\r\njoin battle. Thousands of champions, mounted on more elevated spots,\r\nengage in single combat, and seize each other with their powerful\r\njaws; a still greater number are engaged on both sides in taking\r\nprisoners, which make vain efforts to escape, conscious of the cruel\r\nfate which awaits them when arrived at the hostile formicary. The\r\nspot where the battle most rages is about two or three square feet\r\nin dimensions: a penetrating odour exhales on all sides,--numbers\r\nof ants are here lying dead covered with venom,--others, composing\r\ngroups and chains, are hooked together by their legs or jaws, and\r\ndrag each other alternately in contrary directions. These groups are\r\nformed gradually. At first a pair of combatants seize each other,\r\nand rearing upon their hind-legs mutually spirt their acid, then\r\nclosing they fall and wrestle in the dust. Again recovering their\r\nfeet, each endeavours to drag off his antagonist. If their strength\r\nbe equal, they remain immoveable, till the arrival of a third gives\r\none the advantage. Both, however, are often succoured at the same\r\ntime, and the battle still continues undecided--others take part on\r\neach side, till chains are formed of six, eight, or sometimes ten,\r\nall hooked together and struggling pertinaciously for the mastery:\r\nthe equilibrium remains unbroken, till a number of champions from the\r\nsame nest arriving at once, compel them to let go their hold, and\r\nthe single combats recommence. At the approach of night, each party\r\ngradually retreats to its own city: but before the following dawn the\r\ncombat is renewed with redoubled fury, and occupies a greater extent\r\nof ground. These daily fights continue till, violent rains separating\r\nthe combatants, they forget their quarrel, and peace is restored.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account given by M. Huber of a battle he witnessed. In\r\nthese engagements, he observes, their fury is so wrought up, that\r\nnothing can divert them from their purpose. Though he was close to\r\nthem examining their proceedings, they paid not the least attention\r\nto him, being absorbed by one sole object, that of finding an enemy\r\nto attack. What is most wonderful in this history, though all are of\r\nthe same make, colour, and scent, every ant seemed to know those of\r\nhis own party; and if by mistake one was attacked, it was immediately\r\ndiscovered by the assailant, and caresses succeeded to blows. Though\r\nall was fury and carnage in the space between the two nests, on\r\nthe other side the paths were full of ants going to and fro on the\r\nordinary business of the society, as in a time of peace; and the\r\nwhole formicary exhibited an appearance of order and tranquillity,\r\nexcept that on the quarter leading to the field of battle crowds\r\nmight always be seen, either marching to reinforce the army of their\r\ncompatriots, or returning home with the prisoners they had taken[81],\r\nwhich it is to be feared are the devoted victims of a cannibal feast.\r\n\r\nHaving, I apprehend, satiated you with the fury and carnage of\r\nMyrmidonian wars, I shall next bring forward a scene still more\r\nastonishing, which at first, perhaps, you will be disposed to regard\r\nas the mere illusion of a lively imagination. What will you say when\r\nI tell you that certain ants are affirmed to sally forth from their\r\nnests on predatory expeditions, for the singular purpose of procuring\r\n_slaves_ to employ in their domestic business; and that these ants\r\nare usually a ruddy race, while their slaves themselves are black? I\r\nthink I see you here throw down my letter and exclaim--\"What! ants\r\nturned slave-dealers! This is a fact so extraordinary and improbable,\r\nand so out of the usual course of nature, that nothing but the most\r\npowerful and convincing evidence shall induce me to believe it.\" In\r\nthis I perfectly approve your caution; such a solecism in nature\r\nought not to be believed till it has undergone the ordeal of a most\r\nthorough investigation. Unfortunately in this country we have not the\r\nmeans of satisfying ourselves by ocular demonstration, since none of\r\nthe slave-dealing ants appear to be natives of Britain. We must be\r\nsatisfied, therefore, with weighing the evidence of others. Hear what\r\nM. P. Huber, the discoverer of this almost incredible deviation of\r\nnature from her general laws, has advanced to convince the world of\r\nthe accuracy of his statement, and you will, I am sure, allow that he\r\nhas thrown over his history a colouring of verisimilitude, and that\r\nhis appeal to testimony is in a very high degree satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"My readers,\" says he, \"will perhaps be tempted to believe that I have\r\nsuffered myself to be carried away by the love of the marvellous,\r\nand that, in order to impart greater interest to my narration, I\r\nhave given way to an inclination to embellish the facts that I have\r\nobserved. But the more the wonders of nature have attractions for me,\r\nthe less do I feel inclined to alter them by a mixture of the reveries\r\nof imagination. I have sought to divest myself of every illusion and\r\nprejudice, of the ambition of saying new things, of the prepossessions\r\noften attached to perceptions too rapid, the love of system, and the\r\nlike. And I have endeavoured to keep myself, if I may so say, in a\r\ndisposition of mind perfectly neuter, and ready to admit all facts, of\r\nwhatever nature they might be, that patient observation should confirm.\r\nAmongst the persons whom I have taken as witnesses to the discovery of\r\nmixed ant-hills, I can cite a distinguished philosopher (Prof. Jurine),\r\nwho was desirous of verifying their existence by examining himself the\r\ntwo species united[82].\"\r\n\r\nHe afterwards appeals to nature, and calls upon all who doubt to\r\nrepeat his experiments, which he is sure will soon satisfy them:--a\r\nsatisfaction which, as I have just observed, in this country we\r\ncannot receive, for want of the slave-making species.--And now to\r\nbegin my history.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of ants which engage in these excursions,\r\n_Polyergus rufescens_ and _Formica sanguinea_: but they do not, like\r\nthe African kings, make slaves of adults, their sole object being\r\nto carry off the helpless infants of the colony which they attack,\r\nthe larvæ and pupæ; these they educate in their own nests, till they\r\narrive at their perfect state, when they undertake all the business\r\nof the society[83]. In the following account I shall chiefly confine\r\nmyself to what Huber relates of the first of these species, and\r\nconclude my extracts with his history of an expedition of the latter\r\nto procure slaves.\r\n\r\nThe rufescent ants[84] do not leave their nests to go upon these\r\nexpeditions, which last about ten weeks, till the males are ready to\r\nemerge into the perfect state: and it is very remarkable, that if\r\nany individuals attempt to stray abroad earlier, they are detained\r\nby their slaves, who will not suffer them to proceed. A wonderful\r\nprovision of the Creator to prevent the black colonies from being\r\npillaged when they contain only male and female brood, which would\r\nbe their total destruction, without being any benefit to their\r\nassailants, to whom neuters alone are useful.\r\n\r\nTheir time of sallying forth is from two in the afternoon till five,\r\nbut more generally a little before five: the weather, however, must\r\nbe fine, and the thermometer must stand at above 36° in the shade.\r\nPreviously to marching there is reason to think that they send out\r\nscouts to explore the vicinity; upon whose return they emerge from\r\ntheir subterranean city, directing their course to the quarter from\r\nwhich the scouts came. They have various preparatory signals, such\r\nas pushing each other with the mandibles or forehead, or playing\r\nwith the antennæ, the object of which is probably to excite their\r\nmartial ardour, to give the word for marching, or to indicate the\r\nroute they are to take. The advanced guard usually consists of eight\r\nor ten ants; but no sooner do these get beyond the rest, than they\r\nmove back, wheeling round in a semicircle, and mixing with the main\r\nbody, while others succeed to their station. They have \"_no captain_,\r\n_overseer_, _or ruler_,\" as Solomon observes, their army being\r\ncomposed entirely of neuters, without a single female: thus all in\r\ntheir turns take their place at the head, and then retreating towards\r\nthe rear, make room for others. This is the usual order of their\r\nmarch; and the object of it may be to communicate intelligence more\r\nreadily from one part of the column to another.\r\n\r\nWhen winding through the grass of a meadow they have proceeded to\r\nthirty feet or more from their own habitation, they disperse; and,\r\nlike dogs with their noses, explore the ground with their antennæ\r\nto detect the traces of the game they are pursuing. The negro\r\nformicary, the object of their search, is soon discovered; some of\r\nthe inhabitants are usually keeping guard at the avenues, which\r\ndart upon the foremost of their assailants with inconceivable fury.\r\nThe alarm increasing, crowds of its swarthy inhabitants rush forth\r\nfrom every apartment; but their valour is exerted in vain; for the\r\nbesiegers, precipitating themselves upon them, by the ardour of their\r\nattack compel them to retreat within, and seek shelter in the lowest\r\nstory; great numbers entering with them at the gates, while others\r\nwith their mandibles make a breach in the walls, through which the\r\nvictorious army marches into the besieged city. In a few minutes, by\r\nthe same passages, they as hastily evacuate it, each carrying off in\r\nits mouth a larva or pupa which it has seized in spite of its unhappy\r\nguardians. On their return home with their spoil, they pursue exactly\r\nthe route by which they went to the attack. Their success on these\r\nexpeditions is rather the result of their impetuosity, by which they\r\ndamp the courage of the negroes, than of their superior strength,\r\nthough they are a larger animal; for sometimes a very small body of\r\nthem, not more than 150, has been known to succeed in their attack\r\nand to carry off their booty[85].\r\n\r\nWhen from their proximity they are more readily to be come at than\r\nthose of the negroes, they sometimes assault with the same view the\r\nnest of another species of ant, which I shall call the miners (_F.\r\ncunicularia_). This species being more courageous than the other, on\r\nthis account the rufescent host marches to the attack in closer order\r\nthan usual, moving with astonishing rapidity. As soon as they begin\r\nto enter their habitation, myriads of the miners rushing out fall\r\nupon them with great fury; while others, well aware of their purpose,\r\nmaking a passage through the midst of them, carry off in their mouth\r\nthe larvæ and pupæ. The surface of the nest thus becomes the scene\r\nof an obstinate conflict, and the assailants are often deprived of\r\nthe prey which they had seized. The miners dart upon them, fight them\r\nfoot to foot, dispute every inch of their territory, and defend their\r\nprogeny with unexampled courage and rage. When the rufescents, laden\r\nwith pillage, retire, they do it in close order--a precaution highly\r\nnecessary, since their valiant enemies, pursuing them, impede their\r\nprogress for a considerable distance from their residence.\r\n\r\nDuring these combats the pillaged ant-hill presents in miniature the\r\nspectacle of a besieged city; hundreds of its inhabitants may be seen\r\nmaking their escape, and carrying off in different directions, to a\r\nplace of security, some the young brood, and others their females\r\nthat are newly excluded: but when the danger is wholly passed, they\r\nbring them back to their city, the gates of which they barricade, and\r\nremain in great numbers near them to guard the entrance.\r\n\r\n_Formica sanguinea_, as I observed above, is another of the\r\nslave-making ants; and its proceedings merit separate notice, since\r\nthey differ considerably from those of the rufescents. They construct\r\ntheir nests under hedges of a southern aspect, and likewise attack\r\nthe hills both of the negroes and miners. On the 15th of July, at ten\r\nin the morning, Huber observed a small band of these ants sallying\r\nforth from their formicary, and marching rapidly to a neighbouring\r\nnest of negroes, around which it dispersed. The inhabitants, rushing\r\nout in crowds, attacked them and took several prisoners: those that\r\nescaped advanced no further, but appeared to wait for succours; small\r\nbrigades kept frequently arriving to reinforce them, which emboldened\r\nthem to approach nearer to the city they had blockaded; upon this\r\ntheir anxiety to send couriers to their own nest seemed to increase:\r\nthese spreading a general alarm, a large reinforcement immediately\r\nset out to join the besieging army; yet even then they did not begin\r\nthe battle. Almost all the negroes, coming out of their fortress,\r\nformed themselves in a body about two feet square in front of it, and\r\nthere expected the enemy. Frequent skirmishes were the prelude to the\r\nmain conflict, which was begun by the negroes. Long before success\r\nappeared dubious they carried off their pupæ, and heaped them up at\r\nthe entrance to their nest, on the side opposite to that on which the\r\nenemy approached. The young females also fled to the same quarter.\r\nThe sanguine ants at length rush upon the negroes, and attacking them\r\non all sides, after a stout resistance the latter, renouncing all\r\ndefence, endeavour to make off to a distance with the pupæ they have\r\nheaped up:--the host of assailants pursues, and strives to force from\r\nthem these objects of their care. Many also enter the formicary, and\r\nbegin to carry off the young brood that are left in it. A continued\r\nchain of ants engaged in this employment extends from nest to nest,\r\nand the day and part of the night pass before all is finished. A\r\ngarrison being left in the captured city, on the following morning\r\nthe business of transporting the brood is renewed. It often happens\r\n(for this species of ant loves to change its habitation) that the\r\nconquerors emigrate with all their family to the acquisition which\r\ntheir valour has gained. All the incursions of _F. sanguinea_ take\r\nplace in the space of a month, and they make only five or six in the\r\nyear. They will sometimes travel 150 paces to attack a negro colony.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this account of expeditions undertaken by ants for\r\nso extraordinary a purpose, you will be curious to know how the\r\nslaves are treated in the nests of these marauders--whether they\r\nlive happily, or labour under an oppressive yoke. You must recollect\r\nthat they are not carried off, like our negroes, at an age when the\r\n_amor patriæ_ and all the charities of life which bind them to their\r\ncountry, kindred and friends, are in their full strength, but in\r\nwhat may be called the helpless days of infancy, or in their state\r\nof repose, before they can have formed any associations or imbibed\r\nany notions that render one place and society more dear to them than\r\nanother. Preconceived ideas, therefore, do not exist to influence\r\ntheir happiness, which must altogether depend upon the treatment\r\nwhich they experience at the hands of their new masters. Here the\r\ngoodness of Providence is conspicuous; which, although it has gifted\r\nthese creatures with an instinct so extraordinary, and seemingly so\r\nunnatural, has not made it a source of misery to the objects of it.\r\n\r\nYou will here, perhaps, imagine that I have not sufficiently taken\r\ninto consideration the anxiety and privations undergone by the poor\r\nneuters, in beholding those foster-children, for which they have all\r\nalong manifested such tender solicitude, thus violently snatched\r\nfrom them: but when you reflect that they are the common property\r\nof the whole colony, and that, consequently, there can scarcely be\r\nany separate attachment to particular individuals, you will admit\r\nthat, after the fright and horror of the conflict are over, and\r\ntheir enemies have retreated, they are not likely to experience\r\nthe poignant affliction felt by parents when deprived of their\r\nchildren; especially when you further consider, that most probably\r\nsome of their brood are rescued from the general pillage; or at any\r\nrate their females are left uninjured, to restore the diminished\r\npopulation of their colonies, and to supply them with those objects\r\nof attention, the larvæ, &c. so necessary to that development of\r\ntheir instincts in which consists their happiness.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the point from which I digressed.--The negro and\r\nminer ants suffer no diminution of happiness, and are exposed\r\nto no unusual hardships and oppression in consequence of being\r\ntransplanted into a foreign nest. Their life is passed in much the\r\nsame employments as would have occupied it in their native residence.\r\nThey build or repair the common dwelling; they make excursions to\r\ncollect food; they attend upon the females; they feed them and the\r\nlarvæ; and they pay the necessary attention to the daily sunning of\r\nthe eggs, larvæ, and pupæ. Besides this, they have also to feed their\r\nmasters and to carry them about the nest. This you will say is a\r\nserious addition to the ordinary occupations of their own colonies:\r\nbut when you consider the greater division of labour in these mixed\r\nsocieties, which sometimes unite both negroes and miners in the same\r\ndwelling, so that three distinct races live together, from their vast\r\nnumbers so far exceeding those of the native nest, you will not think\r\nthis too severe employment for so industrious an animal.\r\n\r\nBut you will here ask, perhaps--\"Do the masters take no part in these\r\ndomestic employments? At least, surely, they direct their slaves, and\r\nsee that they keep to their work?\"--No such thing, I assure you--the\r\nsole motive for their predatory excursions seems to be mere laziness\r\nand hatred of labour. Active and intrepid as they are in the field,\r\nat all other times they are the most helpless animals that can be\r\nimagined;--unwilling to feed themselves, or even to walk, their\r\nindolence exceeds that of the sloth itself. So entirely dependent,\r\nindeed, are they upon their negroes for every thing, that upon some\r\noccasions the latter seem to be the masters, and exercise a kind of\r\nauthority over them. They will not suffer them, for instance, to\r\ngo out before the proper season, or alone; and if they return from\r\ntheir excursions without their usual booty, they give them a very\r\nindifferent reception, showing their displeasure, which however soon\r\nceases, by attacking them; and when they attempt to enter the nest,\r\ndragging them out. To ascertain what they would do when obliged to\r\ntrust to their own exertions, Huber shut up thirty of the rufescent\r\nants in a glazed box, supplying them with larvæ and pupæ of their\r\nown kind, with the addition of several negro pupæ, excluding very\r\ncarefully all their slaves, and placing some honey in a corner of\r\ntheir prison. Incredible as it may seem, they made no attempt to\r\nfeed themselves: and though at first they paid some attention to\r\ntheir larvæ, carrying them here and there, as if too great a charge\r\nthey soon laid them down again; most of them died of hunger in less\r\nthan two days; and the few that remained alive appeared extremely\r\nweak and languid. At length, commiserating their condition, he\r\nadmitted a single negro; and this little active creature by itself\r\nre-established order--made a cell in the earth; collected the larvæ\r\nand placed them in it; assisted the pupæ that were ready to be\r\ndeveloped; and preserved the life of the neuter rufescents that still\r\nsurvived. What a picture of beneficent industry, contrasted with the\r\nbaleful effects of sloth, does this interesting anecdote afford!\r\nAnother experiment which he tried made the contrast equally striking.\r\nHe put a large portion of one of these mixed colonies into a woollen\r\nbag, in the mouth of which he fixed a small tube of wood, glazed at\r\nthe top, which at the other end was fitted to the entrance of a kind\r\nof hive. The second day the tube was crowded with negroes going and\r\nreturning:--the indefatigable diligence and activity manifested by\r\nthem in transporting the young brood and their rufescent masters,\r\nwhose bodies were suspended upon their mandibles, was astonishing.\r\nThese last took no active part in the busy scene, while their slaves\r\nshowed the greatest anxiety about them, generally carrying them into\r\nthe hive; and if they sometimes contented themselves with depositing\r\nthem at the entrance of the tube, it was that they might use greater\r\ndispatch in fetching the rest. The rufescent when thus set down\r\nremained for a moment coiled up without motion, and then leisurely\r\nunrolling itself, looked all around, as if it was quite at a loss\r\nwhat direction to take;--it next went up to the negroes, and by the\r\nplay of its antennæ seemed to implore their succour, till one of them\r\nattending to it conducted it into the hive.\r\n\r\nBeings so entirely dependent, as these masters are upon their slaves,\r\nfor every necessary, comfort and enjoyment of their life, can\r\nscarcely be supposed to treat them with rigour or unkindness:--so far\r\nfrom this, it is evident from the preceding details, that they rather\r\nlook up to them, and are in some degree under their control.\r\n\r\nThe above observations, with respect to the indolence of our\r\nslave-dealers, relate principally to the _rufescent_ species; for\r\nthe _sanguine_ ants are not altogether so listless and helpless;\r\nthey assist their negroes in the construction of their nests, they\r\ncollect their sweet fluid from the Aphides; and one of their most\r\nusual occupations is to lie in wait for a small species of ant, on\r\nwhich they feed; and when their nest is menaced by an enemy, they\r\nshow their value for these faithful servants by carrying them down\r\ninto the lowest apartments, as to a place of the greatest security.\r\nSometimes even the rufescents rouse themselves from the torpor that\r\nusually benumbs them. In one instance, when they wished to emigrate\r\nfrom their own to a deserted nest, they reversed what usually takes\r\nplace on such occasions, and carried all their negroes themselves\r\nto the spot they had chosen. At the first foundation also of their\r\nsocieties by impregnated females, there is good reason for thinking,\r\nthat, like those of other species[86], they take upon themselves\r\nthe whole charge of the nascent colony. I must not here omit a most\r\nextraordinary anecdote related by M. Huber. He put into one of his\r\nartificial formicaries pupæ of both species of the slave-collecting\r\nants, which, under the care of some negroes introduced with them,\r\narrived at their imago state, and lived together under the same roof\r\nin the most perfect amity.\r\n\r\nThese facts show what effects education will produce even upon\r\ninsects; that it will impart to them a new bias, and modify in\r\nsome respects their usual instincts, rendering them familiar with\r\nobjects which, had they been educated at home, they would have\r\nfeared, and causing them to love those whom in that case they would\r\nhave abhorred.--It occasions, however, no further change in their\r\ncharacter, since the master and slave, brought up with the same care\r\nand under the same superintendence, are associated in the mixed\r\nformicary under laws entirely opposite[87].\r\n\r\nUnparalleled and unique in the animal kingdom as this history may\r\nappear, you will scarcely deem the next I have to relate less\r\nsingular and less worthy of admiration. That ants should have\r\ntheir _milch cattle_ is as extraordinary as that they should have\r\nslaves. Here, perhaps, you may again feel a fit of incredulity shake\r\nyou;--but the evidence for the fact I am now stating being abundant\r\nand satisfactory, I flatter myself it will not shake you long.\r\n\r\nThe loves of the ants and the aphides (for these last are the kine in\r\nquestion) have long been celebrated; and that there is a connexion\r\nbetween them you may at any time, in the proper season, convince\r\nyourself; for you will always find the former very busy on those\r\ntrees and plants on which the latter abound: and if you examine more\r\nclosely, you will discover that their object in thus attending upon\r\nthem is to obtain the saccharine fluid, which may well be denominated\r\ntheir milk[88], that they secrete.\r\n\r\nThis fluid, which is scarcely inferior to honey in sweetness, issues\r\nin limpid drops from the abdomen of these insects, not only by the\r\nordinary passage, but also by two setiform tubes placed, one on each\r\nside, just above it. Their sucker being inserted in the tender bark,\r\nis without intermission employed in absorbing the sap, which, after\r\nit has passed through the system, they keep continually discharging\r\nby these organs. When no ants attend them, by a certain jerk of the\r\nbody, which takes place at regular intervals, they ejaculate it to a\r\ndistance: but when the ants are at hand, watching the moment when the\r\naphides emit their fluid, they seize and suck it down immediately.\r\nThis, however, is the least of their talents; for they absolutely\r\npossess the art of making them yield it at their pleasure; or, in\r\nother words, of milking them. On this occasion their antennæ are\r\ntheir fingers; with these they pat the abdomen of the aphis on each\r\nside alternately, moving them very briskly; a little drop of fluid\r\nimmediately appears, which the ant takes into its mouth, one species\r\n(_Myrmica rubra_) conducting it with its antennæ, which are somewhat\r\nswelled at the end. When it has thus milked one, it proceeds to\r\nanother, and so on, till being satiated it returns to the nest.\r\n\r\nNot only the aphides yield this repast to the ants, but also the\r\n_Cocci_, with whom they have recourse to similar manœuvres, and with\r\nequal success; only in this case the movement of the antennæ over\r\ntheir body may be compared to the thrill of the finger over the keys\r\nof a piano-forte.\r\n\r\nBut you are not arrived at the most singular part of this\r\nhistory,--that ants make a _property_ of these cows, for the possession\r\nof which they contend with great earnestness, and use every means to\r\nkeep them to themselves. Sometimes they seem to claim a right to the\r\naphides that inhabit the branches of a tree or the stalks of a plant;\r\nand if stranger-ants attempt to share their treasure with them, they\r\nendeavour to drive them away, and may be seen running about in a\r\ngreat bustle, and exhibiting every symptom of inquietude and anger.\r\nSometimes, to rescue them from their rivals, they take their aphides in\r\ntheir mouth, they generally keep guard round them, and when the branch\r\nis conveniently situated, they have recourse to an expedient still more\r\neffectual to keep off interlopers,--they inclose it in a tube of earth\r\nor other materials, and thus confine them in a kind of paddock near\r\ntheir nest, and often communicating with it.\r\n\r\nThe greatest cow-keeper of all the ants, is one to be met with in most\r\nof our pastures, residing in hemispherical formicaries, which are\r\nsometimes of considerable diameter. I mean the yellow ant of Gould (_F.\r\nflava_). This species, which is not fond of roaming from home, and\r\nlikes to have all its conveniences within reach, usually collects in\r\nits nest a large herd of a kind of Aphis, that derives its nutriment\r\nfrom the roots of grass and other plants (_Aphis radicum_); these\r\nit transports from the neighbouring roots, probably by subterranean\r\ngalleries, excavated for the purpose, leading from the nest in all\r\ndirections[89]; and thus, without going out, it has always at hand a\r\ncopious supply of food. These creatures share its care and solicitude\r\nequally with its own offspring. To the eggs it pays particular\r\nattention, moistening them with its tongue, carrying them in its mouth\r\nwith the utmost tenderness, and giving them the advantage of the sun.\r\nThis last fact I state from my own observation; for once upon opening\r\none of these ant-hills early in the spring, on a sunny day, I observed\r\na parcel of these eggs, which I knew by their black colour, very near\r\nthe surface of the nest. My attack put the ants into a great ferment,\r\nand they immediately began to carry these interesting objects down into\r\nthe interior of the nest. It is of great consequence to them to forward\r\nthe hatching of these eggs as much as possible, in order to ensure an\r\nearly source of food for their colony; and they had doubtless in this\r\ninstance brought them up to the warmest part of their dwelling with\r\nthis view. M. Huber, in a nest of the same ant, at the foot of an oak,\r\nonce found the eggs of _Aphis Quercûs_.\r\n\r\nOur yellow ants are equally careful of their Aphides after they\r\nare hatched, when their nest is disturbed conveying them into\r\nthe interior, fighting fiercely for them if the inhabitants of\r\nneighbouring formicaries, as is sometimes the case, attempt to make\r\nthem their prey; and carrying them about in their mouths to change\r\ntheir pasture, or for some other purpose. When you consider that from\r\nthem they receive almost the whole nutriment both of themselves and\r\nlarvæ, you will not wonder at their anxiety about them, since the\r\nwealth and prosperity of the community is in proportion to the number\r\nof their cattle. Several other species keep Aphides in their nests,\r\nbut none in such numbers as those of which I am speaking[90].\r\n\r\nWhen the population exceeds the produce of a country, or its\r\ninhabitants suffer oppression, or are not comfortable in it,\r\nemigrations frequently take place, and colonies issue forth to settle\r\nin other parts of the globe; and sometimes whole nations leave\r\ntheir own country, either driven to this step by their enemies, or\r\nexcited by cupidity to take possession of what appears to them a\r\nmore desirable residence. These motives operate strongly on some\r\ninsects of the social tribes.--Bees and ants are particularly\r\ninfluenced by them. The former, confined in a narrow hive, when their\r\nsociety becomes too numerous to be contained conveniently in it,\r\nmust necessarily send forth the redundant part of their population\r\nto seek for new quarters; and the latter--though they usually can\r\nenlarge their dwelling to any dimensions which their numbers may\r\nrequire, and therefore do not send forth colonies, unless we may\r\ndistinguish by that name the departure of the males and females from\r\nthe nest--are often disgusted with their present habitation, and seek\r\nto establish themselves in a new one:--either the near neighbourhood\r\nof enemies of their own species; annoyance from frequent attacks of\r\nman or other animals; their exposure to cold or wet from the removal\r\nof some species of shelter; or the discovery of a station better\r\ncircumstanced or more abundant in aphides;--all these may operate as\r\ninducements to them to change their residence. That this is the case\r\nmight be inferred from the circumstance noticed by Gould[91], which\r\nI have also partly witnessed myself, that they sometimes transport\r\ntheir young brood to a considerable distance from their home. But M.\r\nHuber, by his interesting observations, has placed this fact beyond\r\nall controversy; and his history of their emigrations is enlivened by\r\nsome traits so singular, that I am impatient to relate them to you.\r\nThey concern chiefly the great hill-ant (_F. rufa_), though several\r\nother species occasionally emigrate.\r\n\r\nSome of the neuters having found a spot which they judge convenient\r\nfor a new habitation, apparently without consulting the rest of the\r\nsociety, determine upon an emigration, and thus they compass their\r\nintention: The first step is to raise recruits:--with this view they\r\neagerly accost several fellow citizens of their own order, caress\r\nthem with their antennæ, lead them by their mandibles, and evidently\r\nappear to propose the journey to them. If they seem disposed to\r\naccompany them, the recruiting officer, for so he may be called,\r\nprepares to carry off his recruit, who, suspending himself upon his\r\nmandibles, hangs coiled up spirally under his neck;--all this passes\r\nin an amicable manner after mutual salutations. Sometimes, however,\r\nthe recruiter takes the other by surprise, and drags him from the\r\nant-hill without giving him time to consider or resist. When arrived\r\nat the proposed habitation, the suspended ant uncoils itself, and,\r\nquitting its conductor, becomes a recruiter in its turn. The pair\r\nreturn to the old nest, and each carries off a fresh recruit, which\r\nbeing arrived at the spot joins in the undertaking:--thus the number\r\nof recruiters keeps progressively increasing, till the path between\r\nthe new and the old city is full of goers and comers, each of the\r\nformer laden with a recruit. What a singular and amusing scene is\r\nthen exhibited of the little people thus employed! When an emigration\r\nof a rufescent colony is going forward, the negroes are seen carrying\r\ntheir masters: and the contrast of the red with the black renders\r\nit peculiarly striking. The little turf-ants (_Myrmica? cæspitum_)\r\nupon these occasions carry their recruits uncoiled, with their head\r\ndownwards and their body in the air.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary scene continues several days; but when all the\r\nneuters are acquainted with the road to the new city, the recruiting\r\nceases. As soon as a sufficient number of apartments to contain\r\nthem are prepared, the young brood, with the males and females,\r\nare conveyed thither, and the whole business is concluded. When\r\nthe spot thus selected for their residence is at a considerable\r\ndistance from the old nest, the ants construct some intermediate\r\nreceptacles, resembling small ant-hills, consisting of a cavity\r\nfilled with fragments of straw and other materials, in which they\r\nform several cells; and here at first they deposit their recruits,\r\nmales, females, and brood, which they afterwards conduct to the final\r\nsettlement. These intermediate stations sometimes become permanent\r\nnests, which however maintain a connexion with the capital city[92].\r\n\r\nWhile the recruiting is proceeding it appears to occasion no sensation\r\nin the original nest; all goes on in it as usual, and the ants that\r\nare not yet recruited pursue their ordinary occupations: whence it is\r\nevident that the change of station is not an enterprise undertaken by\r\nthe whole community. Sometimes many neuters set about this business at\r\nthe same time, which gives a short existence (for in the end they all\r\nreunite into one) to many separate formicaries. If the ants dislike\r\ntheir new city, they quit it for a third, and even for a fourth: and\r\nwhat is remarkable, they will sometimes return to their original\r\none before they are entirely settled in the new station; when the\r\nrecruiting goes in opposite directions, and the pairs pass each other\r\non the road. You may stop the emigration for the present, if you can\r\narrest the first recruiter, and take away his recruit[93].\r\n\r\nI shall now relate to you some other portions of Myrmidonian History,\r\nwhich, though perhaps not so striking and wonderful as the preceding\r\ndetails, are not devoid of interest, and will serve to exemplify\r\ntheir incredible diligence, labour, and ingenuity.\r\n\r\nIn this country it is commonly in March, earlier or later according\r\nto the season, that ants first make their appearance, and they\r\ncontinue their labours till the middle or latter end of October. They\r\nemerge usually from their subterranean winter-quarters on some sunny\r\nday; when, assembling in crowds on the surface of the formicary,\r\nthey may be observed in continual motion, walking incessantly over\r\nit and one another, without departing from home; as if their object,\r\nbefore they resumed their employments, was to habituate themselves\r\nto the action of the air and sun[94]. This preparation requires a\r\nfew days, and then the business of the year commences. The earliest\r\nemployment of ants is most probably to repair the injuries which\r\ntheir habitation has received during their state of inactivity: this\r\nobservation more particularly applies to the hill-ant (_F. rufa_),\r\nall the upper stories of whose dwellings are generally laid flat\r\nby the winter rains and snow; but every species, it may well be\r\nsupposed, has at this season some deranged apartments to restore to\r\norder, or some demolished ones to rebuild.\r\n\r\nAfter their annual labours are begun, few are ignorant how\r\nincessantly ants are engaged in building or repairing their\r\nhabitations, in collecting provisions, and in the care of their\r\nyoung brood; but scarcely any are aware of the extent to which their\r\nactivity is carried, and that their labours are going on even in the\r\nnight.--Yet this is a certain fact.--Long ago Aristotle affirmed\r\nthat ants worked in the night when the moon was at the full[95]; and\r\ntheir historian Gould observes, \"that they even exceed the painful\r\nindustrious bees. For the ants employ each moment, by day and night,\r\nalmost without intermission, unless hindered by excessive rains[96].\"\r\nM. Huber also, speaking of a mason-ant, not found with us, tells us\r\nthat they work after sun-set, and in the night[97]. To these I can\r\nadd some observations of my own, which fully confirm these accounts.\r\nMy first were made at nine o'clock at night, when I found the\r\ninhabitants of a nest of the red ant (_Myrmica rubra_) very busily\r\nemployed; I repeated the observation, which I could conveniently do,\r\nthe nest being in my garden, at various times from that hour till\r\ntwelve, and always found some going and coming, even while a heavy\r\nrain was falling. Having in the day noticed some Aphides upon a\r\nthistle, I examined it again in the night, at about eleven o'clock,\r\nand found my ants busy milking their cows, which did not for the\r\nsake of repose intermit their suction. At the same hour, another\r\nnight, I observed the little negro ant (_F. fusca_) engaged in the\r\nsame employment upon an elder. About two miles from my residence\r\nwas a nest of Gould's hill-ant (_F. rufa_), which, according to M.\r\nHuber, shut their gates, or rather barricade them, every night, and\r\nremain at home[98]. Being desirous of ascertaining the accuracy of\r\nhis statement, early in October, about two o'clock one morning, I\r\nvisited this nest in company with an intelligent friend; and to our\r\nsurprise and admiration we found our ants at work, some being engaged\r\nin carrying their usual burthen, sticks and straws, into their\r\nhabitation, others going out from it, and several were climbing the\r\nneighbouring oaks, doubtless to milk their Aphides. The number of\r\ncomers and goers at that hour, however, was nothing compared with\r\nthe myriads that may always be seen on these nests during the day.\r\nIt so happened that our visit was paid while the moon was near the\r\nfull; so that whether this species is equally vigilant and active\r\nin the absence of that luminary yet remains uncertain. Perhaps this\r\ncircumstance might reconcile Huber's observation with ours, and\r\nconfirm the accuracy of Aristotle's statement before quoted. To the\r\n_red ant_, indeed, it is perfectly indifferent whether the moon shine\r\nor not; they are always busy, though not in such numbers as during\r\nthe day. It is probable that these creatures take their repose at all\r\nhours indifferently; for it cannot be supposed that they are employed\r\nday and night without rest.\r\n\r\nI have related to you in this and former letters most of the works\r\nand employments of ants, but as yet I have given you no account of\r\ntheir roads and track-ways.--Don't be alarmed, and imagine I am\r\ngoing to repeat to you the fable of the ancients, that they wear a\r\npath in the stones[99]; for I suppose you will scarcely be brought\r\nto believe that, as Hannibal cut a way for the passage of his army\r\nover the Alps by means of vinegar, so the ants may with equal effect\r\nemploy the formic acid: but more species than one do really form\r\nroads which lead from their formicaries into the adjoining country.\r\nGould, speaking of his jet-ant (_F. fuliginosa_), says that they\r\nmake several main track-ways, (streets he calls them,) with smaller\r\npaths striking off from them, extending sometimes to the distance of\r\nforty feet from their nest, and leading to those spots in which they\r\ncollect their provisions; that upon these roads they always travel,\r\nand are very careful to remove from them bits of sticks, straw, or\r\nanything that may impede their progress; nay, that they even keep low\r\nthe herbs and grass which grow in them, by constantly biting them\r\noff[100], so that they may be said to mow their walks. But the best\r\nconstructors of roads are the hill-ants (_F. rufa_). Of these De Geer\r\nsays, \"When you keep yourself still, without making any noise, in\r\nthe woods peopled with these ants, you may hear them very distinctly\r\nwalking over the dry leaves which are dispersed upon the soil, the\r\nclaws of their feet producing a slight sound when they lay hold of\r\nthem. They make in the ground broad paths, well beaten, which may be\r\nreadily distinguished, and which are formed by the going and coming\r\nof innumerable ants, whose custom it is always to travel in the same\r\nroute[101].\" From Huber we further learn, that these roads of the\r\nhill-ants are sometimes a hundred feet in length, and several inches\r\nwide; and that they are not formed merely by the tread of these\r\ncreatures, but hollowed out by their labour[102]. Virgil alludes\r\nto their tracks in the following animated lines, which, though not\r\naltogether correct, are very beautiful:\r\n\r\n          \"So when the pismires, an industrious train,\r\n           Embodied rob some golden heap of grain,\r\n           Studious ere stormy winter frowns to lay\r\n           Safe in their darksome cells the treasured prey;\r\n           _In one long track_ the dusky legions lead\r\n           Their prize in triumph through the verdant mead;\r\n           Here bending with the load, a panting throng\r\n           With force conjoin'd heave some huge grain along;\r\n           Some lash the stragglers to the task assign'd,\r\n           Some to their ranks the bands that lag behind:\r\n           They crowd _the peopled path_ in thick array,\r\n           Glow at the work, and darken all the way.\"\r\n\r\nBonnet, observing that ants always keep the same track both in going\r\nfrom and returning to their nest, imagines that their paths are\r\nimbued with the strong scent of the formic acid, which serves to\r\ndirect them; but, as Huber remarks, though this may be of some use\r\nto them, their other senses must be equally employed, since it is\r\nevident, when they have made any discovery of agreeable food, that\r\nthey possess the means of directing their companions to it, though\r\nit is scarcely possible that the path can have been sufficiently\r\nimpregnated with the acid for them to trace their way to it by scent.\r\nIndeed the recruiting system described above, proves that it requires\r\nsome pains to instruct ants in the way from an old to a new nest;\r\nwhereas, were they directed by scent, after a sufficient number had\r\npassed to and fro to imbue the path with the acid, there would be no\r\noccasion for further deportations[103].\r\n\r\nThough ants have no mechanical inventions to diminish the quantum of\r\nlabour, yet by numbers, strength, and perseverance they effect what\r\nat first sight seems quite beyond their powers. Their strength is\r\nwonderful: I once, as I formerly observed, saw two or three of them\r\nhaling along a young snake not dead, which was of the thickness of\r\na goose-quill[104]. St. Pierre relates, that he was highly amused\r\nwith seeing a number of ants carrying off a Patagonian centipede.\r\nThey had seized it by all its legs, and bore it along as workmen\r\ndo a large piece of timber[105]. The Mahometans hold, as Thevenot\r\nrelates, that one of the animals in Paradise is Solomon's ant, which,\r\nwhen all creatures in obedience to him brought him presents, dragged\r\nbefore him a locust, and was therefore preferred before all others,\r\nbecause it had brought a creature so much bigger than itself. They\r\nsometimes, indeed, aim at things beyond their strength; but if they\r\nmake their attack, they pertinaciously persist in it though at the\r\nexpense of their lives. I have in my cabinet a specimen of _Colliuris\r\nlongicollis_, Latr., to one of the legs of which a small ant,\r\nscarcely a thirtieth part of its bulk, is fixed by its jaws. It had\r\nprobably the audacity to attack this giant, compared with itself, and\r\nobstinately refusing to let go its hold was starved to death[106].\r\nProfessor Afzelius once related to me some particulars with respect\r\nto a species of ant in Sierra Leone, which proves the same point. He\r\nsays that they march in columns that exceed all powers of numeration,\r\nand always pursue a straight course, from which nothing can cause\r\nthem to deviate: if they come to a house or other building, they\r\nstorm or undermine it; if a river comes across them, though millions\r\nperish in the attempt, they endeavour to swim over it.\r\n\r\nThis quality of perseverance in ants on one occasion led to very\r\nimportant results, which affected a large portion of this habitable\r\nglobe; for the celebrated conqueror Timour, being once forced to take\r\nshelter from his enemies in a ruined building, where he sat alone many\r\nhours, desirous of diverting his mind from his hopeless condition, he\r\nfixed his observation upon an ant that was carrying a grain of corn\r\n(probably a pupa) larger than itself up a high wall. Numbering the\r\nefforts that it made to accomplish this object, he found that the grain\r\nfell sixty-nine times to the ground, but the seventieth time it reached\r\nthe top of the wall. \"This sight (said Timour) gave me courage at the\r\nmoment; and I have never forgotten the lesson it conveyed[107].\"\r\n\r\nMadame Merian, in her _Surinam Insects_, speaking of the large-headed\r\nant (_Œcodoma cephalotes_), affirms that, if they wish to emigrate,\r\nthey will construct a living bridge in this manner:--One individual\r\nfirst fixes itself to a piece of wood by means of its jaws, and\r\nremains stationary; with this a second connects itself; a third\r\ntakes hold of the second, and a fourth of the third, and so on, till\r\na long connected line is formed fastened at one extremity, which\r\nfloats exposed to the wind, till the other end is blown over so as to\r\nfix itself to the opposite side of the stream, when the rest of the\r\ncolony pass over upon it, as a bridge[108]. This is the process, as\r\nfar as I can collect it from her imperfect account:--as she is not\r\nalways very correct in her statements, I regarded this as altogether\r\nfabulous, till I met with the following history of a similar\r\nproceeding in De Azara, which induces me to give more credit to it.\r\n\r\nHe tells us, that in low districts in South America, that are exposed\r\nto inundations, conical hills of earth may be observed, about three\r\nfeet high, and very near to each other, which are inhabited by a\r\nlittle black ant. When an inundation takes place, they are heaped\r\ntogether out of the nest into a circular mass, about a foot in\r\ndiameter and four fingers in depth. Thus they remain floating upon\r\nthe water while the inundation continues. One of the sides of the\r\nmass which they form is attached to some sprig of grass, or piece\r\nof wood; and when the waters are retired, they return to their\r\nhabitation. When they wish to pass from one plant to another, they\r\nmay often be seen formed into a bridge, of two palms length, and of\r\nthe breadth of a finger, which has no other support than that of its\r\ntwo extremities. One would suppose that their own weight would sink\r\nthem; but it is certain that the masses remain floating during the\r\ninundation, which lasts some days[109].\r\n\r\nYou must now be fully satiated with this account of the constant\r\nfatigue and labour to which our little pismires are doomed by the law\r\nof their nature; I shall therefore endeavour to relieve your mind by\r\nintroducing you to a more quiet scene, and exhibit them to you during\r\ntheir intervals of repose and relaxation.\r\n\r\nGould tells us that the hill-ant is very fond of basking in the sun,\r\nand that on a fine serene morning you may see them conglomerated\r\nlike bees on the surface of their nest, from whence, on the least\r\ndisturbance, they will disappear in an instant[110]. M. Huber also\r\nobserves, after their labours are finished, that they stretch\r\nthemselves in the sun, where they lie heaped one upon another, and\r\nseem to enjoy a short interval of repose: and in the interior of an\r\nartificial nest, in which he had confined some of this species,\r\nwhere he saw many employed in various ways, he noticed some reposing\r\nwhich appeared to be asleep[111].\r\n\r\nBut they have not only their time for repose; they also devote\r\nsome to relaxation, during which they amuse themselves with sports\r\nand games. \"You may frequently perceive one of these ants (_F.\r\nrufa_) (says our Gould) run to and fro with a fellow-labourer in\r\nhis forceps, of the same species and colony. It appeared first in\r\nthe light of provisions; but I was soon undeceived by observing,\r\nthat after being carried for some time, it was let go in a friendly\r\nmanner, and received no personal injury. This amusement, or whatever\r\ntitle you please to give it, is often repeated, particularly amongst\r\nthe hill-ants, who are very fond of this sportive exercise[112].\"\r\nA nest of ants which Bonnet found in the head of a teazle, when\r\nenjoying the full sun, which seems the acme of formic felicity,\r\namused themselves with carrying each other on their backs, the rider\r\nholding with his mandibles the neck of his horse, and embracing it\r\nclosely with his legs[113]. But the most circumstantial account of\r\ntheir sports is given by Huber. \"I approached one day,\" says he, \"one\r\nof their formicaries (he is speaking of _F. rufa_) exposed to the sun\r\nand sheltered from the north. The ants were heaped together in great\r\nnumbers, and seemed to enjoy the temperature which they experienced\r\nat the surface of the nest. None of them were working: this multitude\r\nof accumulated insects exhibited the appearance of a boiling\r\nfluid, upon which at first the eye could scarce fix itself without\r\ndifficulty. But when I set myself to follow each ant separately, I\r\nsaw them approach each other, moving their antennæ with astonishing\r\nrapidity; with their fore-feet they patted lightly the cheeks of\r\nother ants: after these first gestures, which resembled caresses,\r\nthey reared upon their hind-legs by pairs, they wrestled together,\r\nthey seized one another by a mandible, by a leg or an antenna, they\r\nthen let go their hold to renew the attack; they fixed themselves to\r\neach other's trunk or abdomen, they embraced, they turned each other\r\nover, or lifted each other up by turns--they soon quitted the ants\r\nthey had seized, and endeavoured to catch others: I have seen some\r\nwho engaged in these exercises with such eagerness, as to pursue\r\nsuccessively several workers; and the combat did not terminate till\r\nthe least animated, having thrown his antagonist, accomplished his\r\nescape by concealing himself in some gallery[114].\" He compares these\r\nsports to the gambols of two puppies, and tells us that he not only\r\noften observed them in this nest, but also in his artificial one.\r\n\r\nI shall here copy for you a memorandum I formerly made. \"On the ninth\r\nof May, at half-past two, as I was walking on the Plumstead road near\r\nNorwich, on a sunny bank I observed a large number of ants (_Formica\r\nfusca_) agglomerated in crowds near the entrances of their nest.\r\nThey seemed to make no long excursions, as if intent upon enjoying\r\nthe sun-shine at home; but all the while they were coursing about,\r\nand appeared to accost each other with their antennæ. Examining them\r\nvery attentively, I at length saw one dragging another, which it\r\nabsolutely lifted up by its antennæ, and carrying it in the air. I\r\nfollowed it with my eye, till it concealed itself and its antagonist\r\nin the nest. I soon noticed another that had recourse to the same\r\nmanœuvres; but in this instance the ant that was attacked resisted\r\nmanfully, a third sometimes appearing inclined to interfere: the\r\nresult was, that this also was dragged in. A third was haled in\r\nby its legs, and a fourth by its mandibles. What was the precise\r\nobject of these proceedings, whether sport or violence, I could not\r\nascertain. I walked the same way on the following morning, but at an\r\nearlier hour, when only a few comers and goers were to be seen near\r\nthe nest:\" And soon leaving the place, I had no further opportunity\r\nto attend to them.\r\n\r\nAnd now having conducted you through every apartment of the\r\nformicary, and shown you its inhabitants in every light, I shall\r\nleave you to meditate on the extraordinary instincts with which their\r\nCreator has gifted them, reserving what I have to say on the other\r\nsocial insects for a future occasion.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] It is not here meant to be asserted that insects are actuated by\r\nthese passions in the same way that man is, but only that in their\r\nvarious instincts they exhibit the semblance of them, and as it were\r\n_symbolize_ them.\r\n\r\n[36] Plusieurs d'entre eux (_Insectes_) savent user de ressources\r\ningénieuses dans les circonstances difficiles: ils sortent alors de\r\nleur routine accoutumée et semblent agir d'après la position dans\r\nlaquelle ils se trouvent; c'est là sans doute l'un des phénomènes les\r\nplus curieux de l'histoire naturelle. Huber, _Nouvelles Observations\r\nsur les Abeilles_, ii. 198.--Compare also ibid. 250, note N. B.\r\n\r\n[37] I employ occasionally the term _neuters_, though it is not\r\nperfectly proper, for the sake of convenience;--strictly speaking,\r\nthey may rather be regarded as imperfect or sterile females. Yet\r\ncertainly, as the imperfection of their organization unfits them for\r\nsexual purposes, the term _neuter_ is not absolutely improper.\r\n\r\n[38] _Œuv._ ix. 163.\r\n\r\n[39] M. P. Huber in _Linn. Trans._ vi. 256. Reaum. v.\r\n\r\n[40] VOL. I. 244.\r\n\r\n[41] The neuters in all respects bear a stronger analogy to the larvæ\r\nthan to the perfect insects; and, after all, may possibly turn out\r\nto be larvæ, perhaps of the males. Huber seems to doubt their being\r\nneuters. _Nouv. Obs._ ii. 444, note *.\r\n\r\n[42] In this these animals vary from the usual instinct of the social\r\n_Hymenoptera_, the ants, the wasps, and the humble-bees--with whom\r\nthe females lay the first foundations of the colonies, unassisted\r\nby any neuters;--but in the swarms of the hive-bee an election may\r\nperhaps in some instances be said to take place.\r\n\r\n[43] VOL.

Huber, in the account which, in imitation of De Geer,\r\nhe has given of the discoveries made by his predecessors in the\r\nhistory of ants, having passed without notice, probably ignorant of\r\nthe existence of such a writer, those of our intelligent countryman\r\nGould, I shall here give a short analysis of them; from which it will\r\nappear, that he was one of their best, or rather their very best\r\nhistorian, till M. Huber's work came out. His _Account of English\r\nAnts_ was published in 1747, long before either Linné or De Geer had\r\nwritten upon the subject.\r\n\r\nI. _Species._ He describes five species of English ants; viz. 1.\r\nThe hill ant (_Formica rufa_, L.). 2. The jet ant (_F. fuliginosa_,\r\nLatr.). 3. The red ant (_Myrmica rubra_, Latr. _Formica_, Lin.): He\r\nobserves, that this species alone is armed with a sting; whereas, the\r\nothers make a wound with their mandibles, and inject the formic acid\r\ninto it. 4. The common yellow ant (_F. flava_, Latr.): and 5. The\r\nsmall black ant (_F. fusca_, L.).\r\n\r\nII. _Egg._ He observes that the eggs producing males and females are\r\nlaid the earliest, and are the largest:--he seems, however, to have\r\nconfounded the black and brown eggs of _Aphides_ with those of ants.\r\n\r\nIII. _Larva._ These, when first hatched, he observes, are hairy, and\r\ncontinue in the larva state twelve months or more. He, as well as De\r\nGeer, was aware that the larvæ of _Myrmica rubra_ do not, as other\r\nants do, spin a cocoon when they assume the pupa.\r\n\r\nIV. _Pupa._ He found that female ants continue in this state about\r\nsix weeks, and males and neuters only a month.\r\n\r\nV. _Imago._ He knew perfectly the sexes, and was aware that females\r\ncast their wings previous to their becoming mothers; that, at the\r\ntime of their swarms, large numbers of both sexes become the prey of\r\nbirds and fishes: that the surviving females, sometimes in numbers,\r\ngo under ground, particularly in mole-hills, and lay eggs; but he had\r\nnot discovered that they then act the part of neuters in the care of\r\ntheir progeny. He knew also, that when there was more than one queen\r\nin a nest, the rivals lived in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the neuters, he had witnessed the homage they pay their\r\nqueens or fertile females, continued even after their death;--this\r\nhomage, he however observes, which is noticed by no other author,\r\nappears often to be temporary and local--ceasing at certain times,\r\nand being renewed upon a change of residence. He enlarges upon their\r\nexemplary care of the eggs, larvæ, and pupæ. He tells us that the eggs,\r\nas soon as laid, are taken by the neuters and deposited in heaps, and\r\nthat the neuters brood them. He particularly notices their carrying\r\nthem, with the larvæ and pupæ, daily from the interior to the surface\r\nof the nest and back again, according to the temperature; and that\r\nthey feed the larvæ by disgorging the food from their own stomach.\r\nHe speaks also of their opening the cocoons when the pupæ are ready\r\nto assume the imago, and disengaging them from them. With regard\r\nto their labours, he found that they work all night, except during\r\nviolent rains:--that their instinct varies as to the station of their\r\nnest:--that their masonry is consolidated by no cement, but consists\r\nmerely of mould;--that they form roads and trackways to and from\r\ntheir nests;--that they carry each other in sport, and sometimes lie\r\nheaped one on another in the sun.--He suspects that they occasionally\r\nemigrate;--he proves by a variety of experiments that they do not hoard\r\nup provisions. He found they were often infested by a particular kind\r\nof _Gordius_:--he had noticed also that the neuters of _F. rufa_ and\r\n_flava_ (which escaped M. Huber, though he observed it in _Polyergus\r\nrufescens_, Latr.) are of two sizes, which the writer of this note can\r\nconfirm by producing specimens:--and lastly, with Swammerdam, he had\r\nrecourse to artificial colonies, the better to enable him to examine\r\ntheir proceedings, but not comparable to the ingenious apparatus of M.\r\nHuber.\r\n\r\n[52] Gould says that the males and females are nearly equal in\r\nnumber, p. 62; but from Huber's observations it seems to follow that\r\nthe former are most numerous, p. 96.\r\n\r\n[53] That the neuter ants, like those of the hive-bee, are imperfectly\r\norganized females, appears from the following observation of M. Huber\r\n(_Nouv. Observ. &c._ ii. 443.)--\"Les fourmis nous ont encore offert\r\nà cet égard une analogie très frappante; à la vérité, nous n'avons\r\njamais vu pondre les ouvrières, mais nous avons été témoins de leur\r\naccouplement. Ce fait pourroit être attesté par plusieurs membres de la\r\nSociété d'Histoire Naturelle de Génève, à qui nous l'avons fait voir;\r\nl'approche du mâle étoit toujours suivie de la mort de l'ouvrière;\r\nleur conformation ne permet donc pas qu'elles deviennent mères, mais\r\nl'instinct du mâle prouve du moins que ce sont des femelles.\"\r\n\r\n[54] Gould, 103.\r\n\r\n[55] M. Huber calls this an apterous female; yet he could not\r\ndiscover that they laid eggs; and he owns that they more nearly\r\nresembled the workers than the females; and that he should have\r\nconsidered them as such, had he seen them mix with them in their\r\nexcursions. _Huber_, p. 251.\r\n\r\n[56] De Geer ii. 1104.\r\n\r\n[57] Gould, 99.\r\n\r\n[58] Huber, 105.\r\n\r\n[59] _Pilgrimage_, 1090.\r\n\r\n[60] M. Huber observes that fecundated females, after they have lost\r\ntheir wings, make themselves a subterranean cell, some singly, others\r\n_in common_.

P. Huber, from whose\r\nwork the most extraordinary facts are copied, invented a kind of ant\r\nhive; so constructed as to enable him to observe their proceedings\r\nwithout disturbing them.\r\n\r\n[65] Vol. I. 476.\r\n\r\n[66] Gould, 92.

Ins._ 69.--Gould remarks concerning the hill-ant, \"This\r\nspecies is very rapacious after the _vermicles_ and _nymphs_ of other\r\nants. If you place a parcel before or near their colonies, they will,\r\nwith remarkable greediness, seize and carry them off.\" 91, note *.\r\nQuery--Do they this to devour them, or educate them? White made the\r\nsame observation, _Nat. Hist._ ii. 278.\r\n\r\n[84] This species forms a kind of link which connects Latreille's two\r\ngenera _Formica_ and _Myrmica_, borrowing the abdominal squama from\r\nthe former, and the sting from the latter.\r\n\r\n[85] Since the publication of the first edition of this volume I have\r\nmet with fresh confirmation of the extraordinary history here related.\r\nHaving been induced to visit Paris, and calling upon M. Latreille (so\r\njustly celebrated as one of the first entomologists of the age, and to\r\nwhom I feel infinitely indebted for the friendly attentions which he\r\npaid to me during my too short stay in that metropolis), he assured\r\nme, that he had verified all the principal facts advanced by Huber. He\r\nhas also said the same in his _Considérations nouvelles et générales\r\nsur les insectes vivant en Société_. (Mém. du Mus. iii. 407.) At the\r\nsame time he informed me that there was a nest of the rufescent ants\r\nin the Bois de Boulogne, to which place he afterwards was so good\r\nas to accompany me. We went on the 25th of June, 1817. The day was\r\nexcessively hot and sultry. A little before five in the afternoon we\r\nbegan our search. At first we could not discern a single ant in motion.\r\nIn a minute or two, however, my friend directed my attention to one\r\nindividual--two or three more next appeared--and soon a numerous army\r\nwas to be seen winding through the long grass of a low ridge in which\r\nwas their formicary. Just at the entrance of the wood from Paris, on\r\nthe right-hand and near the road, is a bare place paled in for the\r\nSunday amusement of the lower orders--to this the ants directed their\r\nmarch, and upon entering it divided into two columns, which traversed\r\nit rapidly and with great apparent eagerness; all the while exploring\r\nthe ground with their antennæ as beagles with their noses, evidently\r\nas if in pursuit of game. Those in the van, as Huber also observed,\r\nkept perpetually falling back into the main body. When they had passed\r\nthis inclosure, they appeared for some time to be at a loss, making no\r\nprogress but only coursing about: but after a few minutes delay, as if\r\nthey had received some intelligence, they resumed their march and soon\r\narrived at a negro nest, which they entered by one or two apertures. We\r\ncould not observe that any negroes were expecting their attack outside\r\nthe nest, but in a short time a few came out at another opening, and\r\nseemed to be making their escape. Perhaps some conflict might have\r\ntaken place within the nest, in the interval between the appearance of\r\nthese negroes and the entry of their assailants. However this might be,\r\nin a few minutes one of the latter made its appearance with a pupa in\r\nits mouth; it was followed by three or four more; and soon the whole\r\narmy began to emerge as fast as it could, almost every individual\r\ncarrying its burthen. Most that I observed seemed to have pupæ. I\r\nthen traced the expedition back to the spot from which I first saw\r\nthem set out, which according to my steps was about 156 feet from the\r\nnegro formicary. The whole business was transacted in little more than\r\nan hour. Though I could trace the ants back to a certain spot in the\r\nridge before mentioned, where they first appeared in the long grass, I\r\ndid not succeed in finding the entrance to their nest, so that I was\r\ndeprived of the pleasure of seeing the mixed society. As we dined at an\r\n_auberge_ close to the spot, I proposed renewing my researches after\r\ndinner; but a violent tempest of thunder and rain, though I attempted\r\nit, prevented my succeeding; and afterwards I had no opportunity of\r\nrevisiting the place.\r\n\r\nM. Latreille very justly observes that it is physically impossible\r\nfor the _rufescent_ ants (_Polyergus rufescens_), on account of the\r\nform of their jaws and the accessory parts of the mouth, either to\r\nprepare habitations for their family, to procure food, or to feed\r\nthem.--_Considérations nouvelles, &c._ p. 408.\r\n\r\n[86] VOL. I. 370.\r\n\r\n[87] See Huber, chap, vii-xi.\r\n\r\n[88] The ant ascends the tree, says Linné, _that it may milk its\r\ncows, the Aphides_, not kill them. _Syst. Nat._ 962. 3.\r\n\r\n[89] Huber, 195. I have more than once found these Aphides in the\r\nnests of this species of ant.\r\n\r\n[90] See Huber, chap. vi. I have found Aphides in the nest of _Myrmica\r\nrubra_.

(_Wasps and Humble-Bees._)\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now call your attention to such parts of the history of\r\ntwo other descriptions of social insects, _wasps_, namely, and\r\n_humble-bees_, as have not been related to you in my letters on the\r\naffection of insects for their young, and on their habitations. What\r\nI have to communicate, though not devoid of interest, is not to be\r\ncompared with the preceding account of the ants, nor with that which\r\nwill follow of the hive-bee. This, however, may arise more from the\r\ndeficiency of observations than the barrenness of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe first of these animals, _wasps_, (_Vespa_)--with whose proceedings\r\nI shall begin,--we are apt to regard in a very unfavourable light.\r\nThey are the most impertinent of intruders. If a door or window be\r\nopen at the season of the year in which they appear, they are sure\r\nto enter. When they visit us, they stand upon no ceremony, but make\r\nfree with every thing that they can come at. Sugar, meat, fruit, wine,\r\nare equally to their taste; and if we attempt to drive them away, and\r\nare not very cautious, they will often make us sensible that they are\r\nnot to be provoked with impunity. Compared with the bees, they may\r\nbe considered as a horde of thieves and brigands; and the latter as\r\npeaceful, honest, and industrious subjects, whose persons are attacked\r\nand property plundered by them. Yet, with all this love of pillage\r\nand other bad propensities, they are not altogether disagreeable or\r\nunamiable; they are brisk and lively; they do not usually attack\r\nunprovoked; and their object in plundering us is not purely selfish,\r\nbut is principally to provide for the support of the young brood of\r\ntheir colonies.\r\n\r\nThe societies of wasps, like those of ants and other social\r\n_Hymenoptera_, consist of females, males, and workers. The _females_\r\nmay be considered as of two sorts: first, the females by way of\r\neminence, much larger than any other individuals of the community,\r\nequalling six of the workers (from which in other respects they do\r\nnot materially differ) in weight, and laying both male and female\r\neggs. Then the small females, not bigger than the workers, and\r\nlaying only male eggs. This last description of females, which are\r\nfound also both amongst the humble-bees and hive-bees, were first\r\nobserved amongst the wasps by M. Perrot, a friend of Huber's[115].\r\nThe large females are produced later than the workers, and make\r\ntheir appearance in the following spring; and whoever destroys one\r\nof them at that time, destroys an intire colony, of which she would\r\nbe the founder. They are more worthy of praise than the queen-bee;\r\nsince upon the latter, from her very first appearance in the perfect\r\nstate no labour devolves,--all her wants being prevented by a host of\r\nworkers, some of which are constantly attending upon her, feeding\r\nher, and permitting her to suffer no fatigue; while others take\r\nevery step that is necessary for the safety and subsistence of the\r\ncolony. Not so our female wasp;--she is at first an insulated being\r\nthat has had the fortune to survive the rigours of winter. When in\r\nthe spring she lays the foundation of her future empire, she has not\r\na single worker at her disposal: with her own hands and teeth she\r\noften hollows out a cave wherein she may lay the first foundations\r\nof her paper metropolis; she must herself build the first houses,\r\nand produce from her own womb their first inhabitants; which in\r\ntheir infant state she must feed and educate, before they can assist\r\nher in her great design. At length she receives the reward of her\r\nperseverance and labour; and from being a solitary unconnected\r\nindividual, in the autumn is enabled to rival the queen of the hive\r\nin the number of her children and subjects; and in the edifices which\r\nthey inhabit--the number of cells in a vespiary sometimes amounting\r\nto more than 16,000, almost all of which contain either an egg, a\r\ngrub, or a pupa; and each cell serving for three generations in a\r\nyear; which, after making every allowance for failures and other\r\ncasualties, will give a population of at least 30,000. Even at this\r\ntime, when she has so numerous an army of coadjutors, the industry of\r\nthis creature does not cease, but she continues to set an example of\r\ndiligence to the rest of the community.--If by any accident, before\r\nthe other females are hatched, the queen mother perishes, the neuters\r\ncease their labours, lose their instincts, and die.\r\n\r\nThe number of females in a populous vespiary is considerable, amounting\r\nto several hundred; they emerge from the pupa about the latter end of\r\nAugust, at the same time with the males, and fly in September and\r\nOctober, when they pair. Of this large number of females, very few\r\nsurvive the winter. Those that are so fortunate remain torpid till\r\nthe vernal sun recalls them to life and action. They then fly forth,\r\ncollect provision for their young brood, and are engaged in the other\r\nlabours necessary for laying the foundation of their empire: but in the\r\nsummer months they are never seen out of the nest.\r\n\r\nThe _male_ wasps are much smaller than the female, but they weigh as\r\nmuch as two workers. Their antennæ are longer than those of either,\r\nnot, like theirs, thicker at the end, but perfectly filiform; and\r\ntheir abdomen is distinguished by an additional segment. Their\r\nnumbers about equal those of the females, and they are produced at\r\nthe same time. They are not so wholly given to pleasure and idleness\r\nas the drones of the hive. They do not, indeed, assist in building\r\nthe nest, and in the care of the young brood; but they are the\r\nscavengers of the community; for they sweep the passages and streets,\r\nand carry off all the filth. They also remove the bodies of the\r\ndead, which are sometimes heavy burthens for them; in which case two\r\nunite their strength to accomplish the work; or, if a partner be not\r\nat hand, the wasp thus employed cuts off the head of the defunct,\r\nand so effects its purpose. As they make themselves so useful, they\r\nare not, like the male bees, devoted by the workers to an universal\r\nmassacre when the impregnation of the females, the great end of\r\ntheir creation, is answered; but they share the general lot of the\r\ncommunity, and are suffered to survive till the cold cuts off them\r\nand the workers together.\r\n\r\nThe _workers_ are the most numerous, and to us the only troublesome\r\npart of the community; upon whom devolves the main business of the\r\nnest. In the summer and autumnal months, they go forth by myriads into\r\nthe neighbouring country to collect provisions; and on their return to\r\nthe common den, after reserving a sufficiency for the nutriment of the\r\nyoung brood, they divide the spoil with great impartiality;--part being\r\ngiven to the females, part to the males, and part to those workers\r\nthat have been engaged in extending and fortifying the vespiary.\r\nThis division is voluntarily made, without the slightest symptom of\r\ncompulsion. Several wasps assemble round each of the returning workers,\r\nand receive their respective portions. It is curious and interesting to\r\nobserve their motions upon this occasion. As soon as a wasp, that has\r\nbeen filling itself with the juice of fruits, arrives at the nest, it\r\nperches upon the top, and disgorging a drop of its saccharine fluid, is\r\nattended sometimes by two at once, who share the treasure: this being\r\nthus distributed, a second and sometimes a third drop is produced,\r\nwhich falls to the lot of others.\r\n\r\nAnother principal employment of the workers is the enlarging and\r\nrepairing of the nest. It is extremely amusing to see them engaged\r\nupon this foliaceous covering. They work with great celerity; and\r\nthough a large number are occupied at the same time, there is not the\r\nleast confusion. Each individual has its portion of work assigned to\r\nit, extending from an inch to an inch and a half, and is furnished\r\nwith a ball of ligneous fibre, scraped or rather plucked by its\r\npowerful jaws from posts, rails, and the like. This is carried in its\r\nmouth, and is thus ready for immediate use:--but upon this subject\r\nI have enlarged in a former letter[116]. The workers also clean the\r\ncells and prepare them to receive another egg, after the imago is\r\ndisclosed and has left it.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason for thinking, and the opinion has the\r\nsanction of Sir Joseph Banks, that wasps have sentinels placed\r\nat the entrances of their nests, which if you can once seize and\r\ndestroy, the remainder will not attack you. This is confirmed by an\r\nobservation of Mr. Knight's in the _Philosophical Transactions_[117],\r\nthat if a nest of wasps be approached without alarming the\r\ninhabitants, and all communication be suddenly cut off between those\r\nout of the nest and those within it, no provocation will induce the\r\nformer to defend it and themselves. But if one escapes from within,\r\nit comes with a very different temper, and appears commissioned to\r\navenge public wrongs, and prepared to sacrifice its life in the\r\nexecution of its orders. He discovered this when quite a boy.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, that when a large number of female wasps have\r\nbeen observed in the spring, and an abundance of workers has in\r\nconsequence been expected to make their attack upon us in the summer\r\nand autumn, but few have appeared. Mr. Knight observed this in 1806,\r\nand supposes it to be caused by a failure of males[118]. I have since\r\nmore than once made the same observation, and Major Moor, as well\r\nas myself, noticed in the year 1815. What took place here in the\r\nfollowing year may in some degree account for it. Though the summer\r\nhad been very wet, and one may almost say winterly, there were in\r\nthe neighbourhood in which I reside abundance of wasps at the usual\r\ntime; but, except on some few warm days, in which they were very\r\nactive, benumbed by the cold they were crawling about upon the floors\r\nof my house and seemed unable to fly. In this vicinity numbers make\r\ntheir nests in the banks of the river. In the beginning of the month\r\nof October there was a very considerable inundation, after which not\r\na single wasp was to be seen. The continued wet that produces an\r\ninundation may also destroy those nests that are out of the reach\r\nof the waters;--and perhaps this cause may have operated in those\r\nyears above alluded to, in which the appearance of the workers in\r\nthe summer and autumn did not correspond with the large numbers of\r\nfemales observed in the spring.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary seasons, in the month lately mentioned, October, wasps\r\nseem to become less savage and sanguinary; for even flies, of which\r\nearlier in the summer they are the pitiless destroyers, may be seen\r\nto enter their nests with impunity. It is then, probably, that they\r\nbegin to be first affected by the approach of the cold season, when\r\nnature teaches them it is useless longer to attend to their young.\r\nThey themselves all perish, except a few of the females, upon the\r\nfirst attack of frost.\r\n\r\nReaumur, from whom (see the sixth Memoir of his last volume) most\r\nof these observations are taken, put the nests of wasps under glass\r\nhives, and succeeded so effectually in reconciling these little\r\nrestless creatures to them, that they carried on their various works\r\nunder his eye: and if you feel disposed to follow his example, I\r\nhave no doubt you will throw light upon many parts of their history,\r\nconcerning which we are now in darkness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving given you some idea, imperfect indeed from the want of\r\nmaterials, of the societies of wasps, I must next draw up for you the\r\nbest account I can of those of the _humble-bees_[119]. These form\r\na kind of intermediate link between the wasps and the hive-bees,\r\ncollecting honey indeed and making wax, but constructing their\r\ncombs and cells without the geometric precision of the latter, and\r\nof a more rude and rustic kind of architecture; and distinguished\r\nfrom both, though they approach nearer to the bees, by the extreme\r\nhairiness of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe population of a humble-bees nest may be divided into four orders\r\nof individuals: the large females; the small females; the males; and\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\nThe large _females_, like the female wasps, are the original founders\r\nof their republics. They are often so large, that by the side of the\r\nsmall ones or the workers, which in every other respect they exactly\r\nresemble, they look like giants opposed to pygmies. They are excluded\r\nfrom the pupa in the autumn; and pair in that season, with males\r\nproduced from the eggs of the small females. They pass the winter\r\nunder ground, and, as appears from an observation of M. P. Huber, in\r\na particular apartment, separate from the nest, and rendered warm\r\nby a carpeting of moss and grass, but without any supply of food.\r\nEarly in the spring, (for they make their first appearance as soon\r\nas the catkins of the sallows and willows are in flower,) like the\r\nfemale wasps, they lay the foundations of a new colony without the\r\nassistance of any neuters, which all perish before the winter. In\r\nsome instances however, if a conjecture of M. de la Billardière\r\nbe correct, these creatures have an assistant assigned to them.\r\nHe says, at this season (the approach of winter) he found in the\r\nnest of _Bombus Sylvarum_ some old females and workers, whose wings\r\nwere fastened together to retain them in the nest by hindering them\r\nfrom flying; these wings in each individual were fastened together\r\nat the extremity, by means of some very brown wax applied above\r\nand below[120]. This he conceives to be a precaution taken by the\r\nother bees to oblige these individuals to remain in the nest and\r\ntake care of the brood that was next year to renew the population\r\nof the colony. I feel, however, great hesitation in admitting this\r\nconjecture, founded upon an insulated and perhaps an accidental fact.\r\nFor, in the first place, the young females that come forth in the\r\nautumn, and not the old ones, are the founders of new colonies; and\r\ntheir instinct directs them to fulfill the great laws of their nature\r\nwithout such compulsion; and in the next, the workers are never known\r\nto survive the cold of winter.\r\n\r\nThe employment of a large female, besides the care of the young\r\nbrood before described, and the collecting of honey and pollen, is\r\nprincipally the construction of the cells in which her eggs are to be\r\nlaid; which M. P. Huber seems to think, though they often assist in\r\nit, the workers are not able to complete by themselves. So rapid is\r\nthe female in this work, that to make a cell, fill it with pollen,\r\ncommit one or two eggs to it, and cover them in, requires only the\r\nshort space of half an hour. Her family at first consists only of\r\nworkers, which are necessary to assist her in her labours; these\r\nappear in May and June: but the males and females are later, and\r\nsometimes are not produced before August and September[121]. As in\r\nthe case of the hive-bee, the food of these several individuals\r\ndiffers; for the grubs that will turn to workers are fed with honey\r\nand pollen mixed, while those that are destined to be males and\r\nfemales are supplied with pure honey.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of these larger females does not develop itself all at\r\nonce: for it is a remarkable fact, that when they are first hatched\r\nin the autumn, not being in a condition to become mothers, they are\r\nno object of jealousy to the small queens, (as we shall soon see they\r\nare when engaged in oviposition,) and are employed in the ordinary\r\nlabours of the parent nest--that is, they collect honey and pollen,\r\nand make wax; but they do not construct cells. The building instinct\r\nseems as it were in suspense, and does not manifest itself till the\r\nspring; when the maternal sentiment impels them at the same time to\r\nlay eggs and to construct the cells in which they are to be deposited.\r\n\r\nI have told you above, that amongst the wasps a _small_ kind of\r\n_female_ has been discovered: this is the case also amongst the\r\nhumble-bees, in whose societies they are more readily detected: not\r\nindeed by any observable difference between them and the workers,\r\nbut chiefly by the diversity of their instincts:--from the other\r\nfemales they are distinguished solely by their diminutive size. Like\r\nthose of the wasps and hive-bees, these minor queens produce only\r\nmale eggs, which come out in time to fertilize the young females\r\nthat found the vernal colonies. M. P. Huber suspects that, as in the\r\ncase of the female bee, it is a different kind of food that develops\r\ntheir ovaries, and so distinguishes them from the workers. They are\r\ngenerally attended by a small number of males, who form their court.\r\n\r\nM. Huber, watching at midnight the proceedings of a nest which he\r\nkept under a glass, observed the inhabitants to be in a state of\r\ngreat agitation: many of these bees were engaged in making a cell;\r\nthe queen-mother of the colony, as she may be called, who is always\r\nextremely jealous of her pygmy rivals, came and drove them away\r\nfrom the cell;--she in her turn was driven away by the others,\r\nwhich pursued her, beating their wings with the utmost fury, to the\r\nbottom of the nest. The cell was then constructed, and two of them\r\nat the same time oviposited in it. The queen returned to the charge,\r\nexhibiting similar signs of anger; and, chasing them away again, put\r\nher head into the cell, when seizing the eggs that had been laid, she\r\nwas observed to eat them with great avidity. The same scene was again\r\nrenewed, with the same issue. After this, one of the small females\r\nreturned and covered the empty cells with wax. When the mother-queen\r\nwas removed, several of the small females contended for the cell with\r\nindescribable rage, all endeavouring to lay their eggs in it at the\r\nsame time. These small females perish in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe _males_ are usually smaller than the large females, and larger\r\nthan the small ones and workers. They may be known by their longer,\r\nmore filiform, and slenderer antennæ; by the different shape and by\r\nthe beard of their mandibles. Their posterior tibiæ also want the\r\n_corbicula_ and _pecten_ that distinguish the individuals of the\r\nother sex, and their posterior plantæ have no auricle. We learn from\r\nReaumur that the male humble-bees are not an idle race, but work in\r\nconcert with the rest to repair any damage or derangement that may\r\nbefall the common habitation.\r\n\r\nThe _workers_, which are the first fruits of the queen-mother's\r\nvernal parturition, assist her, as soon as they are excluded from\r\nthe pupa, in her various labours. To them also is committed the\r\nconstruction of the waxen vault that covers and defends the nest.\r\nWhen any individual larva has spun its cocoon and assumed the pupa,\r\nthe workers remove all the wax from it; and as soon as it has\r\nattained to its perfect state, which takes place in about five days,\r\nthe cocoons are used to hold honey or pollen. When the bees discharge\r\nthe honey into them upon their return from their excursions, they\r\nopen their mouths and contract their bodies, which occasions the\r\nhoney to fall into the reservoir. Sixty of these honey-pots are\r\noccasionally found in a single nest, and more than forty are\r\nsometimes filled in a day. In collecting honey, humble-bees, if\r\nthey cannot get at that contained in any flower by its natural\r\nopening, will often make an aperture at the base of the corolla, or\r\neven in the calyx, that they may insert their proboscis in the very\r\nplace where nature has stored up her nectar[122]. M. Huber relates\r\na singular anecdote of some hive-bees paying a visit to a nest of\r\nhumble-bees placed under a box not far from their hive, in order\r\nto steal or beg their honey; which places in a strong light the\r\ngood temper of the latter. This happened in a time of scarcity. The\r\nhive-bees, after pillaging, had taken almost entire possession of\r\nthe nest. Some humble-bees which remained in spite of this disaster,\r\nwent out to collect provisions; and bringing home the surplus after\r\nthey had supplied their own immediate wants, the hive-bees followed\r\nthem, and did not quit them till they had obtained the fruit of\r\ntheir labours. They licked them, presented to them their proboscis,\r\nsurrounded them, and thus at last persuaded them to part with the\r\ncontents of their honey-bags. The humble-bees after this flew away\r\nto collect a fresh supply. The hive-bees did them no harm, and\r\nnever once showed their stings;--so that it seems to have been\r\npersuasion rather than force that produced this singular instance of\r\nself-denial. This remarkable manœuvre was practised for more than\r\nthree weeks; when the wasps being attracted by the same cause, the\r\nhumble-bees entirely forsook the nest[123].\r\n\r\nThe workers are the most numerous part of the community, but are\r\nnothing when compared with the numbers to be found in a vespiary\r\nor a beehive:--two or three hundred is a large population for a\r\nhumble-bees nest; in some species it not being more than fifty\r\nor sixty.--They may more easily be studied than either wasps or\r\nhive-bees, as they seem not to be disturbed or interrupted in their\r\nworks by the eye of an observer[124].\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115] Huber, _Nouv.

(_The Hive-bee_[125].)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glory of an all-wise and omnipotent Creator, you will\r\nacknowledge, is wonderfully manifested by the varied proceedings of\r\nthose social tribes of which I have lately treated: but it shines\r\nforth with a brightness still more intense in the instincts that\r\nactuate the common _hive-bee_ (_Apis mellifica_), and which I am next\r\nto lay before you. Indeed, of all the insect associations, there are\r\nnone that have more excited the attention and admiration of mankind\r\nin every age, or been more universally interesting, than the colonies\r\nof these little useful creatures. Both Greek and Roman writers are\r\nloud in their praise; nay, some philosophers were so enamoured of\r\nthem, that, as I observed before[126], they devoted a large portion\r\nof their time to the study of their history. Whether the knowledge\r\nthey acquired was at all equivalent to the years that were spent in\r\nthe attainment of it, may be doubted: for, were it so, it is probable\r\nthat Aristotle and Pliny would have given a clearer and more\r\nconsistent account of the inhabitants of the hive than they have\r\ndone. Indeed had their discoveries borne any proportion to the long\r\ntract of time asserted to have been employed by some in the study of\r\nthese insects, they ought to have rivalled, and even exceeded, those\r\nof the Reaumurs and Hubers of our own age.\r\n\r\nNumerous, and wonderful for their absurdity, were the errors and\r\nfables which many of the ancients adopted and circulated with\r\nrespect to the generation and propagation of these busy insects. For\r\ninstance,--that they were sometimes produced from the putrid bodies\r\nof oxen and lions; the kings and leaders from the brain, and the\r\nvulgar herd from the flesh--a fable derived probably from swarms of\r\nbees having been observed, as in the case of Samson[127], to take\r\npossession of the dried carcases of these animals, or perhaps from\r\nthe myriads of flies (for the vulgar do not readily distinguish flies\r\nfrom bees) often generated in their putrescent flesh. They adopted\r\nanother notion equally absurd; that these insects collect their young\r\nprogeny from the blossoms and foliage of certain plants. Amongst\r\nothers, the Cerinthus, the reed, and the olive-tree, had this virtue\r\nof generating infant bees attributed to them[128]. These specimens of\r\nancient credulity will suffice.\r\n\r\nBut do not think that all the ancients imbibed such monstrous\r\nopinions. Aristotle's sentiments seem to have been much more\r\ncorrect, and not very wide of what some of our best modern apiarists\r\nhave advanced. According to him, the kings (so he denominates the\r\nqueen-bee) generate both kings and workers; and the latter the\r\ndrones. This he seems to have learned from keepers of bees. The\r\nkings, says he in another place, are the parents of the bees, and\r\nthe drones their children. It is right, he observes again, that\r\nthe kings (which by some were called mothers) should remain within\r\nthe hive unfettered by any employment, because they are made for\r\nthe multiplication of the species[129]. To the same purpose Riem\r\nof Lauten of the _Palatinate Apiarian Society_, and Wilhelmi of\r\nthe _Lusatian_, affirm that the queen lays the eggs which produce\r\nthe queens and workers; and the workers those that produce the\r\ndrones or males[130]. Aristotle also tells us, that some in his\r\ntime affirmed that the bees (the workers) were the females, and the\r\ndrones the males: an opinion which he combats from an analogy pushed\r\nrather too far, that nature would never give offensive armour to\r\nfemales[131]. In another place he appears to think that the workers\r\nare hermaphrodites:--his words are remarkable, and seem to indicate\r\nthat he was aware of the sexes of plants: \"having in themselves,\"\r\nsays he, \"_like plants_, the male and the female[132].\"\r\n\r\nFables and absurdities, however, are not confined to the ancients, nor\r\neven to those moderns who lived before Swammerdam, Maraldi, Reaumur,\r\nBonnet, Schirach, John Hunter, Huber, and their followers, by their\r\nobservations and discoveries had thrown so much light upon this\r\ninteresting subject. Even in our own times, a Neapolitan professor,\r\nMonticelli, asserts, on the authority of a certain father Tanoya,\r\nthat in every hive there are three sorts of bees independent of each\r\nother; viz. male and female drones--male and female, I must not say\r\n_queens_--call them what you will: and male and female workers; and\r\nthat each construct their own cells!!! Enough, however, upon this\r\nsubject. I shall now endeavour to lay before you the best authenticated\r\nfacts in the history of these animals; but you must not expect an\r\naccount of them complete in all its parts; for, much as we know,\r\nBonnet's observation will still hold good: \"The more I am engaged\r\nin making fresh observations upon bees, the more steadfast is my\r\nconviction, that the time is not yet arrived in which we can draw\r\nsatisfactory conclusions with respect to their policy. It is only by\r\nvarying and combining experiments in a thousand ways, and by placing\r\nthese industrious flies in circumstances more or less removed from\r\ntheir ordinary state, that we can hope to ascertain the right direction\r\nof their instinct, and the true principles of their government[133].\"\r\n\r\nWhat I have further to say concerning these admirable creatures, will\r\nbe principally taken from the two authors who have given the clearest\r\nand most satisfactory account of them, Reaumur and the elder Huber;\r\nthough I shall add from other sources such additional observations as\r\nmay serve better to elucidate their history.\r\n\r\nThe society of a hive of bees, besides the young brood, consists of\r\none female or queen; several hundreds of males or drones; and many\r\nthousand workers.\r\n\r\nThe _female_, or queen, first demands our attention. Two sorts\r\nof females have been observed amongst the bees, a large one and\r\na small. Mr. Needham was the first that observed the latter; and\r\ntheir existence, M. P. Huber tells us, has been confirmed by several\r\nobservations of his father. They are bred in cells as large as those\r\nof the common queens, from which they differ only in size. Though\r\nthey have ovaries, they have never been observed to lay eggs[134].\r\nHaving never seen one of these, for they are of very rare occurrence,\r\nmy description must be confined to the common female, the genuine\r\nmonarch of the hive[135].\r\n\r\nThere are two descriptions of males--one not bigger than the workers,\r\nsupposed to be produced from a male egg laid in a worker's cell. The\r\ncommon males are much larger, and will counterpoise two workers.\r\n\r\nI have before observed to you that there are two sorts of workers,\r\nthe wax-makers and nurses[138]. They may also be further divided into\r\nfertile and sterile[139]: for some of them, which in their infancy\r\nare supposed to have partaken of some portion of the royal jelly,\r\nlay male eggs. There is found in some hives, according to Huber, a\r\nkind of bees, which from having less down upon the head and thorax\r\nappear blacker than the others, by whom they are always expelled\r\nfrom the hive, and often killed. Perfect ovaries, upon dissection,\r\nwere discovered in these bees, though not furnished with eggs. This\r\ndiscovery induced M^{lle} Jurine, the lady who dissected them, to\r\nexamine the common workers in the same way; and she found in all that\r\nshe examined, what had escaped Swammerdam, perfect though sterile\r\novaries[140]. It is worth inquiry, though M. Huber gives no hint\r\nof this kind, whether these were not in fact superannuated bees,\r\nthat could no longer take part in the labours of the hive. Thorley\r\nremarks, which confirms this idea, that if you closely observe a hive\r\nof bees in July, you may perceive many amongst them of a dark colour,\r\nwith wings rent and torn; but that in September not one of them is\r\nto be seen[141]. Huber does not say whether the wings of the bees in\r\nquestion were lacerated; but in superannuated insects the hair is\r\noften rubbed off the body, which gives them a darker hue than that of\r\nmore recent individuals of the same species. Should this conjecture\r\nturn out true, their banishment and destruction of the seniors of the\r\nhive would certainly not show our little creatures in a very amiable\r\npoint of view. Yet it seems the law of their nature to rid their\r\ncommunity of all supernumerary and useless members, as is evident\r\nfrom their destruction of the drones after their work is done.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that insects have been weighed; but Reaumur's\r\ncuriosity was excited to know the weight of bees; and he found that\r\n336 weighed an ounce, and 5376 a pound. According to John Hunter, an\r\nale-house pint contains 2160 workers.\r\n\r\nI have described to you the persons of the different individuals that\r\ncompose the society of the bee-hive more in detail than I should\r\notherwise have done, in order that you may be the better able to form\r\na judgement upon a most extraordinary circumstance in their history,\r\nwhich is supported by evidence that seems almost incontrovertible.\r\nThe fact to which I allude is this--that if the bees are deprived\r\nof their queen, and are supplied with comb containing young worker\r\nbrood only, they will select one or more to be educated as queens;\r\nwhich, by having a royal cell erected for their habitation, and being\r\nfed with royal jelly for not more than two days, when they emerge\r\nfrom the pupa state (though, if they had remained in the cells which\r\nthey originally inhabited, they would have turned out workers) will\r\ncome forth complete queens, with their form, instincts, and powers\r\nof generation entirely different. In order to produce this effect,\r\nthe grub must not be more than three days old; and this is the age\r\nat which, according to Schirach, (the first apiarist who called the\r\npublic attention to this miracle of nature,) the bees usually elect\r\nthe larvæ to be royally educated; though it appears from Huber's\r\nobservations, that a larva two days or even twenty-four hours old\r\nwill do[142].--Having chosen a grub, they remove the inhabitants and\r\ntheir food from two of the cells which join that in which it resides;\r\nthey next take down the partitions which separate these three cells;\r\nand, leaving the bottoms untouched, raise round the selected worm\r\na cylindrical tube, which follows the horizontal direction of the\r\nother cells: but since at the close of the third day of its life its\r\nhabitation must assume a different form and direction, they gnaw\r\naway the cells below it, and sacrifice without pity the grubs they\r\ncontain, using the wax of which they were formed to construct a new\r\npyramidal tube, which they join at right angles to the horizontal\r\none, the diameter of the former diminishing insensibly from its base\r\nto its mouth. During the two days which the grub inhabits this cell,\r\nlike the common royal cells now become vertical[143], a bee may\r\nalways be observed with its head plunged into it; and when one quits\r\nit another takes its place. These bees keep lengthening the cell as\r\nthe worm grows older, and duly supply it with food, which they place\r\nbefore its mouth, and round its body. The animal, which can only\r\nmove in a spiral direction, keeps incessantly turning to take the\r\njelly deposited before it; and thus slowly working downwards, arrives\r\ninsensibly near the orifice of the cell, just at the time that it is\r\nready to assume the pupa; when, as before described, the workers shut\r\nup its cradle with an appropriate covering[144].\r\n\r\nWhen you have read this account, I fear, with the celebrated John\r\nHunter, you will not be very ready to believe it, at least you will\r\ncall upon me to bring forth my \"strong reasons\" in support of it.\r\nWhat!--you will exclaim--can a larger and warmer house (for the\r\nroyal cells are affirmed to enjoy a higher temperature than those\r\nof the other bees[145]), a different and more pungent kind of food,\r\nand a vertical instead of a horizontal posture, in the first place,\r\ngive a bee a differently shaped tongue and mandibles; render the\r\nsurface of its posterior tibiæ flat instead of concave; deprive\r\nthem of the fringe of hairs that forms the basket for carrying the\r\nmasses of pollen; of the auricle and pecten which enable the workers\r\nto use these tibiæ as pincers[146]; of the brush that lines the\r\ninside of their plantæ? Can they lengthen its abdomen; alter its\r\ncolour and clothing; give a curve to its sting; deprive it of its\r\nwax-pockets, and of the vessels for secreting that substance; and\r\nrender its ovaries more conspicuous, and capable of yielding female\r\nas well as male eggs? Can, in the next place, the seemingly trivial\r\ncircumstances just enumerated altogether alter the instinct of these\r\ncreatures? Can they give to one description of animals address and\r\nindustry; and to the other astonishing fecundity? Can we conceive\r\nthem to change the very passions, tempers, and manners? That the very\r\nsame fœtus if fed with more pungent food, in a higher temperature\r\nand in a vertical position, shall become a female destined to enjoy\r\nlove, to burn with jealousy and anger, to be incited to vengeance,\r\nand to pass her time without labour--that this very same fœtus,\r\nif fed with more simple food, in a lower temperature, in a more\r\nconfined and horizontal habitation, shall come forth a worker\r\nzealous for the good of the community, a defender of the public\r\nrights, enjoying an immunity from the stimulus of sexual appetite\r\nand the pains of parturition--laborious, industrious, patient,\r\ningenious, skilful--incessantly engaged in the nurture of the young;\r\nin collecting honey and pollen; in elaborating wax; in constructing\r\ncells, and the like!--paying the most respectful and assiduous\r\nattention to objects which, had its ovaries been developed, it would\r\nhave hated and pursued with the most vindictive fury till it had\r\ndestroyed them! Further, that these factitious queens (I mean those\r\nthat the bees elect from amongst worker brood, and educate to supply\r\nthe place of a lost one in the manner just described) shall differ\r\nremarkably from the natural queens, (or those that have been wholly\r\neducated in a royal cell,) in being altogether mute[147]--. All this,\r\nyou will think at first sight, so improbable, and next to impossible,\r\nthat you will require the strongest and most irrefragable evidence\r\nbefore you will believe it.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these powerful probabilities to the contrary,\r\nthis astonishing and seemingly incredible fact rests upon strong\r\nfoundations, and is established by experiments made at different\r\ntimes, by different persons of the highest credit, in different parts\r\nof Europe. The first who brought it before the public (as I lately\r\nobserved) was M. Schirach, secretary of an Apiarian Society established\r\nat Little Bautzen in Upper Lusatia. He observed, that bees when shut up\r\nwith a portion of comb, containing only worker brood, would soon erect\r\nroyal cells, and thus obtain queens:--the experiment was frequently\r\nrepeated, and the result was almost uniformly the same. In one\r\ninstance he tried it with a single cell, and it succeeded[148]. This\r\ncurious fact was communicated to the celebrated Bonnet, who, though he\r\nhesitated long before he admitted it, was at length fully convinced. M.\r\nWilhelmi (Schirach's brother-in-law), though at first he accounted for\r\nthe fact upon other principles, and objected strongly to the doctrine\r\nin question, induced by the powerful evidence in favour of it, at\r\nlast gave up his former opinion, and embraced it. And, to mention no\r\nmore, the great Aristomachus of modern times, M. Huber, by experiments\r\nrepeated for ten years, was fully convinced of the truth of Schirach's\r\nposition[149].\r\n\r\nThe fact in question, though the public attention was first called\r\nto it by the latter gentleman, had indeed been practically known\r\nlong before he wrote. M. Vogel, in a letter to Wilhelmi, asserts\r\nthat numerous experiments confirming this extraordinary fact had\r\nbeen made by more than a hundred different persons, in the course\r\nof more than a hundred years; and that he himself had known old\r\ncultivators of bees who had unanimously declared to him, that, when\r\nproper precautions were taken, in a practice of more than fifty\r\nyears, the experiment had never failed[150]. Signor Monticelli, the\r\nNeapolitan professor before mentioned, informs us that the Greeks and\r\nTurks of the Ionian Islands know how to make artificial swarms; and\r\nthat the art of producing queens at will has been practised by the\r\ninhabitants of a little Sicilian island called Favignana, from very\r\nremote antiquity; and he even brings arguments to prove that it was\r\nno secret to the Greeks and Romans[151], though had the practice been\r\ncommon it would surely have been noticed by Aristotle and Pliny.\r\n\r\nBonner, a British apiarist, asserts that he has had successful\r\nrecourse to the Lusatian experiment[152]; and Mr. Payne of Shipdam\r\nin Norfolk (who for many years has been engaged in the culture of\r\nbees, and has paid particular attention to their proceedings) relates\r\nthat he well remembers that the bees of one of his hives, which he\r\ndiscovered had lost their queen, were engaged in erecting some royal\r\ncells upon the ruins of some of the common ones. He also informs\r\nme that he has found Huber's statements, as far as he has had an\r\nopportunity of verifying them, perfectly accurate[153].\r\n\r\nAs I think you will allow that the evidence just detailed to you is\r\nabundantly sufficient to establish the fact in question, we will\r\nnow see whether any satisfactory account can be given for such\r\nchanges being produced by such causes. \"It does not appear to me\r\nimprobable,\" says Bonnet, \"that a certain kind of nutriment, and in\r\nmore than usual abundance, may cause a development in the grubs of\r\nbees, of organs which would never be developed without it. I can\r\nreadily conceive also, that a habitation considerably more spacious,\r\nand differently placed, is absolutely necessary to the complete\r\ndevelopment of organs which the new nutriment may cause to grow in\r\nall directions[154].\" And again, with respect to the wings of the\r\nqueen bee, which do not exceed those of the workers in length, he\r\nthinks that this may arise from their being of a substance too stiff\r\nto admit of their extension. Those parts and points that were in a\r\nstate to yield most easily to the action which this kind of nutriment\r\nproduced, would be most prominent; and the vertical position of the\r\ngrub and pupa, since nature does nothing in vain, may probably assist\r\nthis action, and render the parts of the animal more capable of such\r\nextension than if it continued in a horizontal position.\r\n\r\nWe know, with respect to the human species and the larger animals,\r\nthat numerous differences, both as to the form and relative\r\nproportion of parts, occur continually. The cause of these\r\ndifferences we cannot always ascertain; yet in many instances they\r\nmay either be derived from the nutriment which the embryo receives\r\nin the womb, or from the greater or less dimensions or higher or\r\nlower temperature of that organ--a case that analogically would not\r\nbe very wide of that of the grub or embryo of a bee inclosed in a\r\ncell. Some of the differences in man I now allude to, may often be\r\ncaused by a particular diet in childhood; a warmer or a colder, a\r\nlooser or a tighter dress, or the like. Thus, for instance, the\r\nEgyptians, who went bare-headed, had their skulls remarkably thick;\r\nwhile the Persians, who covered the head with a turban or mitre,\r\nwere distinguished by the tenuity of theirs. Again, the inhabitants\r\nof certain districts are often remarkable for peculiarities of form,\r\nwhich are evidently produced by local circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe following reasoning may not be inapplicable to the development\r\nor non-development, according to their food and habitation, of the\r\novaries of these insects. An infant tightly swathed, as was formerly\r\nthe custom, in swaddling bands, without being allowed the free\r\nplay of its little limbs, fed with unwholesome food, or uncherished\r\nby genial warmth, may from these circumstances have so imperfect\r\na development of its organs as to be in consequence devoted to\r\nsterility. When a cow brings forth two calves, and one of them is a\r\nfemale, it is always barren, and partakes in part of the characters\r\nof the other sex[155]. In this instance, the space and food that in\r\nordinary cases are appropriated to one, are divided between two; so\r\nthat a more contracted dwelling and a smaller share of nutriment seem\r\nto prevent the development of the ovaries.\r\n\r\nThe following observations, mostly taken from an essay of\r\nthe celebrated anatomist John Hunter, in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_, since they are intimately connected with the subject\r\nthat we are now considering, will not be here misplaced. In animals\r\njust born, or very young, there are no peculiarities of shape,\r\nexclusive of the primary distinctions, by which one sex may be known\r\nfrom the other. Thus secondary distinctive characters, such as the\r\nbeard in men, and the breasts in women, are produced at a certain\r\nperiod of life; and these secondary characters, in some instances,\r\nare changed for those of the other sex; which does not arise from\r\nany action at the first formation, but takes place when the great\r\ncommand \"Increase and multiply\" ceases to operate. Thus women in\r\nadvanced life are sometimes distinguished by beards; and after they\r\nhave done laying, hen-birds occasionally assume the plumage of the\r\ncock; this has been observed more than once by ornithologists, more\r\nparticularly with respect to the pheasant and the pea-hen[156].--For\r\nfemales to assume the secondary characters of males, seems certainly\r\na more violent change, than for a worker bee, which may be regarded\r\nas a sterile female, in consequence of a certain process, to assume\r\nthe secondary characters of a fertile female.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the variations of instinct and character which result\r\nfrom the different modes of rearing the young bees that we are now\r\nconsidering; it would not, I think, be difficult to prove, that\r\ncauses at first sight equally inadequate have produced effects full\r\nas important on the habits, tempers, and characters of men and other\r\nanimals: but as these will readily occur to you, I shall not now\r\nenlarge upon them.\r\n\r\nDid we know the causes of the various deviations, as to form and\r\nthe like, observable in the three kingdoms of nature, and could\r\napply them, we should be able to produce these deviations at our\r\npleasure. This is exactly what the bees do. Their instinct teaches\r\nthem that a certain kind of food, supplied to a grub inhabiting a\r\ncertain dwelling, in a certain position, will produce certain effects\r\nupon it, rendering it different from what it would have been under\r\nordinary circumstances, and fitted to answer their peculiar wants.\r\n\r\nI trust that these arguments and probabilities will in some degree\r\nreconcile you to what at first sight seems so extraordinary and\r\nextravagant a doctrine. If not yet fully satisfied, I can only\r\nrecommend your having recourse to experiments yourself. Leaving you\r\ntherefore to this best mode of proof, I shall proceed to another\r\npart of my history:--but first I must mention an experiment of\r\nReaumur's, which seems to come well in here. To ascertain whether\r\nthe expectation of a queen was sufficient to keep alive the instinct\r\nand industry of the worker-bees, he placed in a glazed hive some\r\nroyal cells containing both grubs and pupæ, and then introduced about\r\n1000 or 1500 workers and some drones. These workers, which had been\r\ndeprived of their queen, at first destroyed some of the grubs in\r\nthese cells; but they clustered around two that were covered in, as\r\nif to impart warmth to the pupæ they contained; and on the following\r\nday they began to work upon the portions of comb with which he had\r\nsupplied them, in order to fix and lengthen them. For two or three\r\ndays the work went on very leisurely, but afterwards their labours\r\nassumed their usual character of indefatigable industry[157]. There\r\nis no difficulty, therefore, when a hive loses its sovereign, to\r\nsupply the bees with an object that will interest them, and keep\r\ntheir works in progress.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other facts with respect to the larvæ and pupæ of\r\nthe bees, which, before I enter upon the history of them in their\r\nperfect form, I shall now detail to you. Sixteen days is the time\r\nassigned to a _queen_ for her existence in her preparatory states,\r\nbefore she is ready to emerge from her cell. Three she remains in\r\nthe egg; when hatched she continues feeding five more; when covered\r\nin she begins to spin her cocoon, which occupies another day: as if\r\nexhausted by this labour, she now remains perfectly still for two\r\ndays and sixteen hours; and then assumes the pupa, in which state\r\nshe remains exactly four days and eight hours--making in all the\r\nperiod I have just named. A longer time, by four days, is required to\r\nbring the _workers_ to perfection; their preparatory states occupying\r\ntwenty days, and those of the _male_ even twenty-four. The former\r\nconsumes half a day more than the queen in spinning its cocoon,--a\r\ncircumstance most probably occasioned by a singular difference in\r\nthe structure and dimensions of this envelope, which I shall explain\r\nto you presently. Thus you see that the peculiar circumstances which\r\nchange the form and functions of a bee, accelerate its appearance as\r\na perfect insect; and that by choosing a grub three days old, when\r\nthe bees want a queen, they actually gain six days; for in this case\r\nshe is ready to come forth in ten days, instead of sixteen, which\r\nwould be required, was a recently laid egg fixed upon[158].\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of bees, though without feet, are not altogether without\r\nmotion. They advance from their first station at the bottom of the\r\ncell, as I before hinted, in a spiral direction. This movement, for\r\nthe first three days, is so slow as to be scarcely perceptible; but\r\nafter this it is more easily discerned. The animal now makes two\r\nentire revolutions in about an hour and three quarters; and when the\r\nperiod of its metamorphosis arrives, it is scarcely more than two\r\nlines from the mouth of the cell. Its attitude, which is always the\r\nsame, is a strong curve[159]. This occasions the inhabitant of a\r\nhorizontal cell to be always perpendicular to the horizon, and that\r\nof a vertical one to be parallel with it.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable difference, as I lately observed, takes place in\r\nspinning their cocoons,--the grubs of workers and drones spinning\r\ncomplete cocoons, while those that are spun by the females are\r\nincomplete, or open at the lower end, and covering only the head\r\nand trunk and the first segment of the abdomen. This variation is\r\nprobably occasioned by the different forms of the cells; for, if a\r\nfemale larva be placed in a worker's cell, it will spin a complete\r\ncocoon; and, _vice versâ_, if a worker larva be placed in a royal\r\ncell, its cocoon will be incomplete[160]. No provision of the Great\r\nAuthor of nature is in vain. In the present instance, the fact which\r\nwe are considering is of great importance to the bees; for, were\r\nthe females wholly covered by the thick texture of a cocoon, their\r\ndestruction by their rival competitors for the throne could not so\r\nreadily be accomplished; they either would not be able to reach them\r\nwith their stings, or the stings might be detained by their barbs in\r\nthe meshes of the cocoon, so that they would not be able to disengage\r\nthem. On the use of this instinctive and murderous hatred of their\r\nrivals I shall soon enlarge.\r\n\r\nWhen our young prisoners are ready to emerge, they do not, like\r\nthe ants, require the assistance of the workers, but themselves\r\neat through the cocoon and the cell that incloses it. By a wise\r\nprovision, which prevents the injury or destruction of a cell, they\r\ngenerally make their way through the cover or lid with which the\r\nworkers had shut it up; though sometimes, but not often, a female\r\nwill break through the side of her prison.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown you our little chemists in their preparatory states,\r\nand carried you from the egg to the cocoon, both of which may be\r\ndeemed a kind of cradle, in which they are nursed to fit them for two\r\nvery different conditions of existence, I must now introduce you to a\r\nscene more interesting and diversified; in which all their wonderful\r\ninstincts are displayed in full action, and we see them exceed some of\r\nthe most vaunted products of human wisdom, art, and skill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _queen-mother_ here demands our first attention, as the personage\r\nupon whom, when established in her regal dignity, the welfare and\r\nhappiness of the apiarian community altogether depend. I shall begin\r\nmy history with the events that befall her on her quitting the\r\nroyal cradle and appearing in the perfect state. And here you will\r\nfind that the first moments of her life, prior to her election to\r\nlead a swarm or fill a vacant throne, are moments of the greatest\r\nuneasiness and vexation, if not of extreme peril and vindictive and\r\nmortal warfare. The Homeric maxim, that \"the government of many\r\nis not good[161],\" is fully adopted and rigorously adhered to in\r\nthese societies. The jealous Semiramis of the hive will bear no\r\nrival near her throne. There are usually not less than sixteen, and\r\nsometimes not less than twenty, royal cells in the same nest; you\r\nmay therefore conceive what a sacrifice is made when one only is\r\nsuffered to live and to reign. But here a distinction obtains which\r\nshould not be overlooked: in some instances a single queen only is\r\nwanted to govern her native hive; in others several are necessary to\r\nlead the swarms. In the first case, inevitable death is the lot of\r\nall but one; in the other, as many as are wanted are preserved from\r\ndestruction by the precautions taken on that occasion, under the\r\ndirection of an all-wise Providence, by the workers.\r\n\r\nI shall enlarge a little on each of these cases. In the formicary, as\r\nwe have seen, rival queens live together very harmoniously without\r\nmolesting each other: but there is that instinctive jealousy in a\r\nqueen bee, that no sooner does she discover the existence of another\r\nin the hive, than she is put into a state of the most extreme\r\nagitation, and is not easy until she has attacked and destroyed her.\r\n\r\nNaturalists had observed, that when there were two queens in the\r\nsame hive, one of them soon perished; but some supposed (this was\r\nthe opinion of Schirach and Riem) that the workers destroyed the\r\nsupernumeraries. Reaumur, however, conjectured that these queens\r\nattacked each other; and his conjecture has been since confirmed\r\nby the actual observation of other naturalists. Blassiere, the\r\ntranslator of Schirach, tells us, as what he had himself witnessed,\r\nthat the strongest queen kills her rival with her sting; and the same\r\nis asserted by Huber, whose opportunities of observation were greater\r\nthan those of any of his precursors[162].\r\n\r\nThe queen that is first liberated from her confinement, and has assumed\r\nthe perfect or imago state (it is to be supposed that the author is\r\nhere speaking of a hive which has lost the old queen), soon after this\r\nevent goes to visit the royal cells that are still inhabited. She darts\r\nwith fury upon the first with which she meets; by means of her jaws\r\nshe gnaws a hole large enough to introduce the end of her abdomen,\r\nand with her sting, before the included female is in a condition to\r\ndefend herself or resist her attack, she gives her a mortal wound. The\r\nworkers, who remain passive spectators of this assassination, after\r\nshe quits the victim of her jealousy, enlarge the breach that she has\r\nmade, and drag forth the carcase of a queen just emerged from the\r\nthin membrane that envelopes the pupa. If the object of her attack be\r\nstill in the pupa state, she is stimulated by a less violent degree of\r\nrage, and contents herself with making a breach in the cell: when this\r\nhappens, the death of the inclosed insect is equally certain, for the\r\nworkers enlarge the breach, pull it out, and it perishes[163]. If it\r\nhappens, as it sometimes does, that two queens are disclosed at the\r\nsame time, the care of Providence to prevent the hive from being wholly\r\ndespoiled of a governor is singularly manifested by a remarkable trait\r\nin their instinct, which, when mutual destruction seems inevitable,\r\nmakes them separate from each other as if panic-struck. \"Two young\r\nqueens,\" says M. Huber, \"left their cells one day, almost at the same\r\nmoment;--as soon as they came within sight, they darted upon each\r\nother, as if inflamed by the most ungovernable anger, and placed\r\nthemselves in such an attitude, that the antennæ of each were held by\r\nthe jaws of its antagonist; head was opposed to head, trunk to trunk,\r\nabdomen to abdomen; and they had only to bend the extremity of the\r\nlatter, and they would have fallen reciprocal victims to each other's\r\nsting.\" But nature having decreed that these duels should not be fatal\r\nto both combatants, as soon as they were thus circumstanced a panic\r\nfear seemed to strike them, and they disengaged themselves, and each\r\nfled away. After a few minutes were expired, the attack was renewed\r\nin a similar manner with the same issue; till at last one suddenly\r\nseizing the other by her wing, mounted upon her and inflicted a mortal\r\nwound[164].\r\n\r\nThe combats I have here described to you took place between virgin\r\nqueens; but M. Huber found that those which had been impregnated\r\nwere actuated by the same animosity, and attacked royal cells with\r\na fury equally destructive. When another fertile queen had been\r\nintroduced into this hive, a singular scene ensued, which proves\r\nhow well aware the workers are that they cannot prosper with two\r\nsovereigns. Soon after she was introduced, a circle of bees was\r\nformed round the stranger, not to compliment her on her arrival, or\r\npay her the usual homage, but to confine her, and prevent her escape;\r\nfor they insensibly agglomerated themselves in such numbers round\r\nher, and hemmed her in so closely, that in about a minute she was\r\ncompletely a prisoner. While this was transacting, what was equally\r\nremarkable, other workers assembled in clusters round the legitimate\r\nqueen, and impeded all her motions; so that soon she was not more\r\nat liberty than the intruder. It seemed as if the bees foresaw the\r\ncombat that was to ensue between the two rivals, and were impatient\r\nfor the event; for they only confined them when they appeared to\r\navoid each other. To witness the homage, respect and love that they\r\nusually manifest to their lawful ruler; the anxiety concerning her\r\nwhich they often exhibit: and the distrust which for a time (as we\r\nshall see hereafter) they usually show towards strange ones even when\r\ndeprived of their own; one would expect that, rather than permit\r\nsuch a perilous combat, they would unite in the defence of their\r\nsovereign, and cause the interloper to perish under the stroke of\r\ntheir fatal stings. But no; the contest for empire must be between\r\nthe rival candidates: no worker must interfere in any other way than\r\nthat which I have described; no contending armies must fight the\r\nbattles of their sovereigns, for the law of succession seems to be\r\n\"_detur fortiori_.\" But to return to my narrative. The legitimate\r\nqueen appearing inclined to move towards that part of the comb on\r\nwhich her rival was stationed, the bees immediately began to retire\r\nfrom the space that intervened between them, so that there was soon\r\na clear arena for the combat. When they could discern each other,\r\nthe rightful queen rushing furiously upon the pretender, seized her\r\nwith her jaws near the root of the wings, and, after fixing her\r\nwithout power of motion against the comb, with one stroke of her\r\nsting dispatched her. If ever-so-many queens are introduced into a\r\nhive, all but one will perish, and that one will have won the throne\r\nby her own unassisted valour and strength. Sometimes a strange queen\r\nattempts of herself to enter a hive: in this case the workers, who\r\nare upon the watch and who examine every thing that presents itself,\r\nimmediately seize her with their jaws by the legs or wings, and hem\r\nher in so straitly with a clustered circle of guards, turning their\r\nheads on all sides towards her, that it is impossible for her to\r\npenetrate within. If they retain her prisoner too long, she dies\r\neither from the want of food or air, but never from their stings[165].\r\n\r\nHere you may perhaps feel curious to know, supposing the reigning\r\nqueen to die or be killed, and the bees to have discovered their\r\nloss, whether they would then receive a foreigner that offers herself\r\nto them or is introduced amongst them. Reaumur says they would do\r\nthis immediately[166]; but Huber, who had better means of observing\r\nthem, and studied them with more undivided attention, affirms that\r\nthis will not be the case, unless twenty-four hours have elapsed\r\nsince the death of the old queen. Previously to this period, as if\r\nthey were absorbed by grief at their calamity, or indulged a fond\r\nhope of her revival, an intruder would be treated exactly as I have\r\ndescribed. But when the period just mentioned is passed, they will\r\nreceive any queen that is presented to them with the customary\r\nhomage, and she may occupy the vacant throne[167].\r\n\r\nI must now beg you to attend to what takes place in the second case\r\nthat I mentioned, where queens are wanted to lead forth swarms.\r\nHere you will, with reason, suppose that nature has instilled some\r\ninstinct into the bees, by which these necessary individuals are\r\nrescued from the fury of the reigning sovereign.\r\n\r\nDid the old queen of the hive remain in it till the young ones were\r\nready to come forth, her instinctive jealousy would lead her to\r\nattack them all as successively produced; and being so much older and\r\nstronger, the probability is that she would destroy them; in which case\r\nthere could be no swarms, and the race would perish. But this is wisely\r\nprevented by a circumstance which invariably takes place--that the\r\nfirst swarm is conducted by this queen, and not by a newly disclosed\r\none, as Reaumur and others have supposed. Previously to her departure,\r\nafter her great laying of male eggs in the month of May, she oviposits\r\nin the royal cells when about three or four lines in length, which the\r\nworkers have in the mean time constructed. These however are not all\r\nfurnished in one day,--a most essential provision, in consequence of\r\nwhich the queens come forth successively, in order to lead successive\r\nswarms. There is something singular in the manner in which the workers\r\ntreat the young queens that are to lead the swarms. After the cells are\r\ncovered in, one of their first employments is to remove here and there\r\na portion of the wax from their surface, so as to render it unequal;\r\nand immediately before the last metamorphosis takes place, the walls\r\nare so thin that all the motions of the inclosed pupa are perceptible\r\nthrough them. On the seventh day the part covering the head and trunk\r\nof the young female, if I may so speak, is almost entirely unwaxed.\r\nThis operation of the bees facilitates her exit, and probably renders\r\nthe evaporation of the superabundant fluids of the body of the pupa\r\nmore easy.\r\n\r\nYou will conclude, perhaps, when all things are thus prepared for the\r\ncoming forth of the inclosed female, that she will quit her cell at the\r\nregular period, which is seven days:--but you would be mistaken. Were\r\nshe indeed permitted to pursue her own inclinations, this would be the\r\ncase: but here the bees show how much they are guided in their instinct\r\nby circumstances and the wants of their society; for did the new queen\r\nleave her cell, she would immediately attack and destroy those in the\r\nother cells; a proceeding which they permit, as I have before stated,\r\nwhen they only want a successor to a defunct or a lost sovereign. As\r\nsoon therefore as the workers perceive--which the transparency of\r\nthe cell permits them to do--that the young queen has cut circularly\r\nthrough her cocoon, they immediately solder the cleft up with some\r\nparticles of wax, and so keep her a prisoner against her will. Upon\r\nthis, as if to complain of such treatment, she emits a distinct sound,\r\nwhich excites no pity in the breasts of her subjects, who detain her a\r\nprisoner two days longer than nature has assigned for her confinement.\r\nIn the interim, she sometimes thrusts her tongue through the cleft she\r\nhas made, drawing it in and out till she is noticed by the workers,\r\nto make them understand that she is in want of food. Upon perceiving\r\nthis they give her honey, till her hunger being satisfied she draws her\r\ntongue back--upon which they stop the orifice with wax[168].\r\n\r\nYou may think it perhaps extraordinary that the workers should thus\r\nendeavour to retard the appearance of their young females beyond its\r\nnatural limit; but when I explain to you the reason for this seeming\r\nincongruity of instinct, you will adore the wisdom that implanted it.\r\nWere a queen permitted to leave her cell as soon as the natural term\r\nfor it arrived, it would require some time to fit her for flight,\r\nand to lead forth a swarm; during which interval a troublesome task\r\nwould be imposed upon the workers, who must constantly detain her\r\na prisoner to prevent her from destroying her rivals, which would\r\nrequire the labours and attention of a much larger number than are\r\nnecessary to keep her confined to her cell. On this account they\r\nnever suffer her to come forth till she is perfectly fit to take her\r\nflight. When at length she is permitted to do this, if she approaches\r\nthe other royal cells, the workers on guard seem greatly irritated\r\nagainst her, and pull and bite and chase her away; and she enjoys\r\ntranquillity only while she keeps at a distance from them. As her\r\ninstinct is constantly urging her to attack them, this proceeding\r\nis frequently repeated. Sometimes standing in a particular and\r\ncommanding attitude, she utters that authoritative sound which so\r\nmuch affects the bees; they then all hang down their heads and remain\r\nmotionless; but as soon as it ceases, they resume their opposition.\r\nAt last she becomes violently agitated, and communicating her\r\nagitation to others, the confusion more and more increases, till\r\na swarm leaves the hive, which she either precedes or follows. In\r\nthe same manner the other young queens are treated while there are\r\nswarms to go forth; but when the hive is sufficiently thinned, and it\r\nbecomes troublesome to guard them in the manner here described, they\r\ncome forth unnoticed, and fight unimpeded till one alone remains to\r\nfill the deserted throne of the parent hive.--You see here the reason\r\nwhy the eggs that produce these queens are not laid at the same time,\r\nbut after some interval, that they may come forth successively. For\r\ndid they all make their appearance together, it would be a much more\r\nlaborious and difficult task to keep them from destroying each other.\r\n\r\nWhen the bees thus delay the entrance of the young queens into their\r\nworld, they invariably let out the oldest first; and they probably\r\nknow their progress to maturity by the emission of the sound lately\r\nmentioned. The accurate Huber took the trouble to mark all the royal\r\ncells in a hive as soon as the workers had covered them in, and he\r\nfound that they were all liberated according to seniority. Those\r\nfirst covered first emit the sound, and so on successively; whence\r\nhe conjectures that this is the sign by which the workers discover\r\ntheir age. As their captivity, however, is sometimes prolonged to\r\neight or ten days, this circumstance in that time may be forgotten.\r\nIn this case he supposes that their tones grow stronger as they grow\r\nolder, by which the workers may be enabled to distinguish them. It\r\nis remarkable that no guard is placed round the mute queens bred\r\naccording to the Lusatian method, which, when the time for their\r\nappearance is come, are not detained in captivity a single moment;\r\nbut, as you have heard, are left to fight, conquer, or die[169].\r\n\r\nYou must not think, however, from what I have been saying, that the old\r\nqueen never destroys the young ones previously to her leading forth\r\nthe earliest swarm. She is allowed the most uncontrolled liberty of\r\naction; and if she chooses to approach and destroy the royal cells, her\r\nsubjects do not oppose her. It sometimes happens, when unfavourable\r\nweather retards the first swarm, that all the royal progeny perishes\r\nby the sting of their mother, and then no swarm takes place. It is to\r\nbe observed that she never attacks a royal cell till its inhabitant is\r\nready to assume the pupa, therefore much will depend upon their age.\r\nWhen they arrive at this state, her horror of these cells, and aversion\r\nto them, are extreme: she attacks, perhaps, and destroys several; but\r\nfinding it too laborious, for they are often numerous, to destroy the\r\nwhole, the same agitation is caused in her as if she were forcibly\r\nprevented, and she becomes disposed to depart, rather than remain in\r\nthe midst of her rivals, though her own offspring.\r\n\r\nBut though the bees, in one of these cases, appear such unconcerned\r\nspectators of the destruction of royal personages, or rather, the\r\napplauders and inciters of the bloody fact; and in the other show\r\nlittle respect to them, put such a restraint upon their persons,\r\nand manifest such disregard to their wishes; yet when they are once\r\nacknowledged as governors of the hive, and leaders of the colony, their\r\ninstinct assumes a new and wonderful direction. From this moment they\r\nbecome the \"_publica cura_,\" the objects of constant and universal\r\nattention; and wherever they go, are greeted by a homage which evinces\r\nthe entire devotion of their subjects. You seemed amused and interested\r\nin no slight degree by what I related in a former letter of the marked\r\nrespect paid by the ants to their females[170]: but this will bear no\r\ncomparison with that shown by the inhabitants of the hive to their\r\nqueen. She appears to be the very soul of all their actions, and the\r\ncentre of their instincts. When they are deprived of her, or of the\r\nmeans of replacing her, they lose all their activity, and pursue no\r\nlonger their daily labours. In vain the flowers tempt them with their\r\nnectar and ambrosial dust: they collect neither; they elaborate no wax,\r\nand build no cells; they scarcely seem to exist; and, indeed, would\r\nsoon perish, were not the means of restoring their monarch put within\r\ntheir reach. But, if a small piece of comb containing the brood grubs\r\nof workers be given to them, all seem endued with new life: their\r\ninstincts revive; they immediately set about building royal cells; they\r\nfeed with their appropriate food the grubs they have selected, and\r\nevery thing proceeds in the usual routine. Virgil has described this\r\nattachment of the bees to their sovereign with great truth and spirit\r\nin the following lines:\r\n\r\n          \"Lydian nor Mede so much his king adores,\r\n           Nor those on Nilus' or Hydaspes' shores:\r\n           The state united stands while he remains,\r\n           But should he fall, what dire confusion reigns!\r\n           Their waxen combs and honey, late their joy,\r\n           With grief and rage distracted, they destroy:\r\n           He guards the works, with awe they him surround,\r\n           And crowd about him with triumphant sound;\r\n           Him frequent on their duteous shoulders bear,\r\n           Bleed, fall, and die for him in glorious war.\"\r\n\r\nM. Huber thus describes the consequences of the loss of a\r\nqueen.--When the queen is removed from a hive, at first the bees\r\nseem not to perceive it, their order and tranquillity not being\r\ndisturbed, and their labours proceeding as usual. About an hour after\r\nher departure, inquietude begins to manifest itself amongst them;\r\nthe care of the young brood no longer engages their attention, and\r\nthey run here and there, as if in great agitation. This agitation,\r\nhowever, is at first confined to a small portion of the community.\r\nThe bees that are first sensible of their loss meet with others, they\r\nmutually cross their antennæ, and strike them lightly. By this action\r\nthey appear to communicate the sad intelligence to those who receive\r\nthe blow, who in their turn impart it in the same way to others.\r\nDisorder and confusion increase rapidly, till the whole population is\r\nin a tumult. Then the workers may be seen running over the combs,\r\nand against each other; impetuously rushing to the entrance and\r\nquitting the hive; from thence they spread themselves all around,\r\nthey re-enter, and go out again and again. The hum in the hive\r\nbecomes very loud, and increases the tumult, which lasts two or three\r\nhours, rarely four or five: they then return and resume their wonted\r\ncare of the young; and if the hive be visited twenty-four hours after\r\nthe departure of the queen, it will be seen that they have taken\r\nsteps to repair their loss by filling some of the cells with a larger\r\nquantity of jelly than is the usual portion of common larvæ; which\r\nhowever is intended, it seems, not for the food of the inhabitant,\r\nbut for a cushion to elevate it, since it is found unconsumed in\r\nthe cell when the grub has descended into the pyramidal habitation\r\nafterwards prepared for it[171].\r\n\r\nIf, after being removed, their old queen is restored to the hive, they\r\ninstantly recognise her, and pay her the usual attentions; but if a\r\nstrange one be introduced within the first twelve hours after the\r\nold one is lost, she is kept a close prisoner till she perishes: if\r\ntwenty-four hours, as I have before hinted, have expired since they\r\nlost their queen, and you introduce a new one, at the moment you set\r\nthis stranger upon a comb, the workers that are near her first touch\r\nher with their antennæ, and then pass their proboscis over all parts\r\nof her body: place is next given to others, who salute her in the\r\nsame manner:--all then beat their wings at the same time, and range\r\nthemselves in a circle round their new sovereign. A kind of agitation\r\nis now communicated to the whole surface of the comb, which brings all\r\nthe bees upon it to see what is going forward. This may be called the\r\nfirst shout of the applauding multitude to welcome the arrival of their\r\nnew sovereign. The circle of courtiers increases, they vibrate their\r\nwings and bodies, but without tumult, as if their sensations were very\r\nagreeable. When she begins to move, the circle opens to let her pass,\r\nand all follow her steps. She is received with similar demonstrations\r\nof loyalty in the other parts of the hive, is soon acknowledged queen\r\nby all, and begins to lay eggs.--Reaumur put some bees into a hive\r\nwithout their queen, and then introduced to them one that he had taken\r\nwhen half perished with cold, and kept in a box, in which she had\r\ncovered herself with powder. The bees immediately owned her for their\r\nqueen, employed themselves very anxiously in cleaning her and warming\r\nher, sometimes turning her upon her back for this purpose--and then\r\nbegan to construct cells in their new habitation[172]. Even when the\r\nbees have got young brood, have built or are building royal cells, and\r\nare engaged in feeding these hopes of their hive, knowing that their\r\ngreat aim is already accomplished, they cease all these employments\r\nwhen this intruder comes amongst them.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the ordinary attention and homage that they pay\r\nto their sovereigns--the bees do more than respect their queen,\r\nsays Reaumur, they are constantly on the watch to make themselves\r\nuseful to her, and to render her every kind office; they are for\r\never offering her honey; they lick her with their proboscis, and\r\nwhereever she goes she has a court to attend upon her[173]. It may\r\nhere be observed, that the stimulant which excites the bees to\r\nthese acts of homage is the pregnant state of their queen, and her\r\nfitness to maintain the population of the hive; all they do being\r\nwith a view to the public good: for while she remains a virgin she is\r\ntreated with the utmost indifference, which is exchanged, as soon as\r\nimpregnation has taken place, for the above marks of attachment[174].\r\n\r\nThe instinct of the bees, however, does not always enable them to\r\ndistinguish a partially fertile queen from one that is universally so.\r\nWhat I mean is this--A queen, whose impregnation is retarded beyond the\r\ntwenty-eighth day of her whole existence, lays only male eggs, which\r\nare of no use whatever to the community, unless they are at the same\r\ntime provided with a sufficient supply of workers. Yet even a queen\r\nof this description, and sometimes one that is entirely sterile, is\r\ntreated by them with the same respect and homage as a fertile one.\r\nThis seems to evince an amiable feeling in these creatures, attachment\r\nto the person as well as to the functions of the sovereign; which is\r\nfurther manifested by their unwillingness at first to receive a new\r\nsovereign upon the loss or death of their old one. Nay, this respect is\r\nsometimes shown to the carcase of a defunct queen, which Huber assures\r\nus he has seen bees treat with the same attention that they had shown\r\nher when alive; for a long time preferring her inanimate corpse to\r\nthe fertile queens that he offered to them[175]. He attributes this\r\nto some agreeable sensation which they experience from their queens,\r\nindependent of their fecundity. But since virgin queens, as we have\r\nseen, do not excite it, more probably it is a remnant of their former\r\nattachment, first excited by her fecundity, and afterwards strengthened\r\nand continued by habit.\r\n\r\nI may here introduce an interesting anecdote related by Reaumur, which\r\nstrongly marks the attachment of bees to their queen when apparently\r\nlifeless. He took one out of the water quite motionless, and seemingly\r\ndead, which had lost part of one of its legs. Bringing it home, he\r\nplaced it amongst some workers that he had found in the same situation,\r\nmost of which he had revived by means of warmth; some however still\r\nbeing in as bad a state as the poor queen. No sooner did these revived\r\nworkers perceive the latter in this wretched condition, than they\r\nappeared to compassionate her case, and did not cease to lick her with\r\ntheir tongues till she showed signs of returning animation; which the\r\nbees no sooner perceived, than they set up a general hum, as if for joy\r\nat the happy event. All this time they paid no attention to the workers\r\nwho were in the same miserable state[176].\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion I have mentioned the laying of the eggs by the\r\nqueen[177]; but as I did not then at all enlarge upon it, I shall now\r\nexplain the process more in detail. In a subsequent letter I shall\r\nnotice, what has so much puzzled learned apiarists--her fecundation:\r\nwhich is now ascertained beyond contradiction, from the observations\r\nof M. Huber, to take place in the open air, and to be followed by the\r\ndeath of the unfortunate male[178]. It is to be recollected that,\r\nfrom September to April, generally speaking, there are no males in\r\nthe hives; yet during this period the queen often oviposits: a former\r\nfecundation, therefore, must fertilize all the eggs laid in this\r\ninterval. The impregnation, in order to ensure complete fertility,\r\nmust not be too long retarded: for, as I before observed, if this be\r\ndelayed beyond the twenty-eighth day of her existence, her ovaries\r\nbecome so vitiated, that she can no longer lay eggs that will produce\r\nworkers, but can only furnish the hive with a male population; which,\r\nhowever high a privilege it may be accounted amongst men, is the\r\nreverse of it amongst the bees. When this is the case, the abdomen of\r\nthe queen becomes so enlarged that she is no longer able to fly[179];\r\nand, what is remarkable, she loses that instinctive animosity which\r\nstimulates the fertile ones to attack their rivals[180]. Thus she\r\nseems to own that she is not equal to the duties of her station, and\r\ncan tolerate another to discharge them in her room. When we consider\r\nhow much virgin queens are slighted by their subjects, we may suppose\r\nthat nature urges them to take the opportunity of the first warm day,\r\nwhen the males fly forth, to pair with one of them.\r\n\r\nWhen fecundation has not been retarded, forty-six hours after it has\r\ntaken place, the queen begins to lay eggs that will produce workers,\r\nand continues for the subsequent eleven months, more or less, to lay\r\nthem solely; and it is only after this period that an uninterrupted\r\nlaying of male eggs commences.--But when it has been retarded, after\r\nthe same number of hours she begins laying male eggs, and continues to\r\nproduce these alone during her whole life. From hence it should seem\r\nto follow, that the former kind of eggs are first in the oviducts,\r\nand, if impregnation be not effected within a given time, that all\r\nthe worker embryos perish. Yet how this can take place with respect\r\nto those that in a fertile queen should succeed the laying of male\r\neggs, or be produced in the second year of her life, seems difficult\r\nto conceive;--or how the male embryos escape this fate, which destroys\r\nall the female, both those that are to precede them and those that are\r\nto follow them. Is it impossible that the sex of the embryo may be\r\ndetermined by the period at which the _aura seminalis_ vivifies it, and\r\nby the state of the ovary at that time? In one state of the ovary this\r\nprinciple may cause the embryos to become workers, in another males.\r\nAnd something of this kind perhaps may be the cause of hermaphrodites\r\nin other animals. But this I give merely as conjecture[181]: the truth\r\nseems enveloped in mystery that we cannot yet penetrate. Huber is of\r\nopinion that a single impregnation fertilizes all the eggs that a queen\r\nwill produce during her whole life, which is sometimes more than two\r\nyears[182]. But of this enough.\r\n\r\nI said that forty-six hours after impregnation the queen begins\r\nlaying worker eggs;--this is not, however, invariable. When her\r\nimpregnation takes place late in the year, she does not begin laying\r\ntill the following spring. Schirach asserts, that in one season a\r\nsingle female will lay from 70,000 to 100,000 eggs[183]. Reaumur\r\nsays, that upon an average she lays about two hundred in a day, a\r\nmoderate swarm consisting of 12,000, which are laid in two months;\r\nand Huber, that she lays above a hundred. All these statements, the\r\nobservations being made in different climates, and perhaps under\r\ndifferent circumstances, may be true. The laying of worker eggs\r\nbegins in February, sometimes so early as January[184]. After this,\r\nin the spring, the great laying of male eggs commences, lasting\r\nthirty days; in which time about 2000 of these eggs are laid. Another\r\nlaying of them, but less considerable, takes place in autumn. In\r\nthe season of oviposition, the queen may be discerned traversing\r\nthe combs in all directions with a slow step, and seeking for cells\r\nproper to receive her eggs. As she walks she keeps her head inclined,\r\nand seems to examine, one by one, all the cells she meets with. When\r\nshe finds one to her purpose, she immediately gives to her abdomen\r\nthe curve necessary to enable it to reach the orifice of the cell,\r\nand to introduce it within it. The eggs are set in the angle of the\r\npyramidal bottom of the cell, or in one of the hollows formed by the\r\nconflux of the sides of the rhombs, and, being besmeared with a kind\r\nof gluten, stand upright. If, however, it be a female that lays only\r\nmale eggs, they are deposited upon the lowest of the sides of the\r\ncell, as she is unable to reach the bottom[185].\r\n\r\nWhile our prolific lady is engaged in this employment, her court\r\nconsists of from four to twelve attendants, which are disposed\r\nnearly in a circle, with their heads turned towards her. After\r\nlaying from two to six eggs, she remains still, reposing for eight\r\nor nine minutes. During this interval the bees in her train redouble\r\ntheir attentions, licking her fondly with their tongues. Generally\r\nspeaking, she lays only one egg in a cell; but when she is pressed,\r\nand there are not cells enough, from two to four have been found in\r\none. In this case, as if they were aware of the consequences, the\r\nprovident workers remove all but one. From an experiment of Huber's,\r\nit appears that the instinct of the queen invariably directs her to\r\ndeposit worker eggs in worker cells; for when he confined one, during\r\nher course of laying worker eggs, where she could only come at male\r\ncells, she refused to oviposit in them; and trying in vain to make\r\nher escape, they at length dropped from her; upon which the workers\r\ndevoured them. Retarded queens, however, lose this instinct, and\r\noften, though they lay only male eggs, oviposit in worker cells and\r\neven in royal ones. In this latter case the workers themselves act as\r\nif they suffered in their instinct from the imperfect state of their\r\nqueen; for they feed these male larvæ with royal jelly, and treat\r\nthem as they would a real queen. Though male eggs deposited in worker\r\ncells produce small males, their education in a royal cell with\r\n\"royal dainties\" adds nothing to their ordinary dimensions[186].\r\n\r\nThe _swarming_ of bees is a very curious and interesting subject, to\r\nwhich, since a female is the _sine quâ non_ on this occasion, I may\r\nvery properly call your attention here. You will recollect that I\r\nsaid something upon the principle of emigrations, when I was amusing\r\nyou with the history of ants[187]; but the object with them seems to\r\nbe merely a change of station for one more convenient or less exposed\r\nto injury, and not to diminish a superabundant population. Whereas\r\nin the societies of the hive-bee, the latter is the general cause of\r\nemigrations, which invariably take place every year, if their numbers\r\nrequire it; if not, when the male eggs are laid, no royal cells are\r\nconstructed, and no swarm is led forth. What might be the case with\r\nants, were they confined to hives, we cannot say. Formicaries in\r\ngeneral are capable of indefinite enlargement, therefore want of\r\nroom does not cause emigration;--but bees being confined to a given\r\nspace, which they possess not the means of enlarging,--to avoid\r\nthe ill effects resulting from being too much crowded, when their\r\npopulation exceeds a certain limit, they must necessarily emigrate.\r\nSometimes--for instance, when wasps have got into a hive--the bees\r\nwill leave it, in order to fly from an inconvenience or enemy which\r\nthey cannot otherwise avoid; but it does not very often happen that\r\nthey wholly desert a hive.\r\n\r\nApiarists tell us that, in this country, the best season for swarming\r\nis from the middle of May to the middle of June; but swarms sometimes\r\noccur so early as the beginning of April, and as late as the middle\r\nof August[188]. The first swarm, as I before observed, is led by the\r\nreigning queen, and takes place when she is so much reduced in size,\r\nin consequence of the number of eggs she has laid, (for previously to\r\noviposition her gravid body is so heavy that she can scarcely drag\r\nit along,) as to enable her to fly with ease. The most indubitable\r\nsign that a hive is preparing to swarm,--so says Reaumur,--is when\r\non a sunny morning, the weather being favourable to their labours,\r\nfew bees go out of a hive, from which on the preceding day they\r\nhad issued in great numbers, and little pollen is collected. This\r\ncircumstance, he observes, must be very embarrassing to one who\r\nattempts to explain all their proceedings upon principles purely\r\nmechanical. Does it not prove, he asks, that all the inhabitants of\r\na hive, or almost all, are aware of a project that will not be put\r\nin execution before noon, or some hours later? For why should bees,\r\nwho worked the day before with so much activity, cease their labours\r\nin a habitation which they are to quit at noon, were they not aware\r\nthat they should soon abandon it[189]? The appearance of the males,\r\nand the clustering of the population at the mouth of the hive,\r\n(though this last is less to be relied upon, being often occasioned\r\nby extreme heat,) are also indications of the approach of this event.\r\nA good deal depends, however, on the warmth of the atmosphere and\r\nthe state of the weather either to accelerate or retard it. Another\r\nsign is a general hum in the evening, which is continued even during\r\nthe night,--all seems to be in a bustle, the greatest restlessness\r\nagitates the bees. Sometimes to hear this hum the ear must be placed\r\nclose to the hive, when clear and sharp sounds may be distinguished,\r\nwhich appear to be produced by the vibration of the wings of a single\r\nbee. This hum by some has been gravely construed into an harangue of\r\nthe queen to animate her subjects to the great undertaking which she\r\nnow meditates--the founding of a new empire. There sometimes seem to\r\nhappen suddenly amongst them, says Reaumur, events which put all the\r\nbees in motion, for which no account can be given. If you observe a\r\nhive with attention, you may often remain a long time and hear only\r\na slight murmur, and then, all in a moment, a sonorous hum will be\r\nexcited, and the workers, as if seized with a panic terror, may be\r\nseen quitting their various labours, and running off in different\r\ndirections. At these moments if a young queen goes out, she will be\r\nfollowed by a numerous troop.\r\n\r\nHuber has given a very lively and interesting account of the interior\r\nproceedings of the hive on this occasion. The queen, as soon as she\r\nbegan to exhibit signs of agitation, no longer laid her eggs with\r\norder as before, but irregularly, as if she did not know what she was\r\nabout. She ran over the bees in her way; they in their turn struck\r\nher with their antennæ, and mounted upon her back; none offered her\r\nhoney, but she helped herself to it from the cells in her path. The\r\nusual homage of a court attending round her was no longer paid. Those\r\nhowever that were excited by her motions followed her, rousing such\r\nas were still tranquil upon the combs. She soon had traversed the\r\nwhole hive, when the agitation became general. The workers, now no\r\nlonger attentive to the young brood, ran about in all directions;\r\neven those that returned from foraging, before the agitation was at\r\nits height, no sooner entered the hive than they participated in\r\nthese tumultuous movements, and, neglecting to free themselves from\r\nthe masses of pollen on their hind legs, ran wildly about. At length\r\nthere was a general rush to the outlets of the hive, which the queen\r\naccompanied, and the swarm took place[190].\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that this agitation, excited by the queen,\r\nincreases the customary heat of the hive to a very high temperature,\r\nwhich the action of the sun augments till it becomes intolerable, and\r\nwhich often causes the bees accumulated near the mouth of the hive to\r\nperspire so copiously, that those near the bottom, who support the\r\nweight of the rest, appear drenched with the moisture. This intolerable\r\nheat determines the most irresolute to leave the hive. Immediately\r\nbefore the swarming, a louder hum than usual is heard, many bees take\r\nflight, and, if the queen be at their head, or soon follows them,\r\nin a moment the rest rise in crowds after her into the air, and the\r\nelement is filled with bees as thick as the falling snow. The queen at\r\nfirst does not alight upon the branch on which the swarm fixes; but\r\nas soon as a group is formed and clustered, she joins it: after this\r\nit thickens more and more, all the bees that are in the air hastening\r\nto their companions and their queen, so as to form a living mass of\r\nanimals supporting themselves upon each by the claws of their feet.\r\nThus they sometimes are so concatenated, each bee suspending its legs\r\nto those of another, as to form living chaplets[191]. After this they\r\nsoon become tranquil, and none are seen in the air. Before they are\r\nhoused they often begin to construct a little comb on the branch on\r\nwhich they alight[192]. Sometimes it happens that two queens go out\r\nwith the same swarm; and the result is, that the swarm at first divides\r\ninto two bodies, one under each leader; but as one of these groups\r\nis generally much less numerous than the other, the smallest at last\r\njoins the largest, accompanied by the queen to whom they had attached\r\nthemselves; and, when they are hived, this unfortunate candidate for\r\nempire falls sooner or later a victim to the jealousy of her rival.\r\nTill this great question is decided, the bees do not settle to their\r\nusual labours.[192] If no queen goes out with a swarm, they return to\r\nthe hive from whence they came.\r\n\r\nAs in regular monarchies, so in this of the bees, the first-born is\r\nprobably the fortunate candidate for the throne. She is usually the\r\nmost active and vigorous; the most able to take flight; and in the\r\nbest condition to lay eggs. Though the queen that is victorious, and\r\nmounts the throne, is not, as Virgil asserts, resplendent with gold\r\nand purple, and her rival hideous, slothful and unwieldy[193], yet\r\nsome differences are observable; the successful candidate is usually\r\nredder and larger than the others; these last, upon dissection,\r\nappear to have no eggs ready for laying, while the former, which is a\r\npowerful recommendation, is usually full of them. Eggs are commonly\r\nfound in the cells twenty-four hours after swarming, or at the latest\r\ntwo or three days.\r\n\r\nYou may think, perhaps, that the bees which emigrate from the parent\r\nhive are the youth of the colony; but this is not the case, for\r\nbees of all ages unite to form the swarms. The numbers of which\r\nthey consist vary much. Reaumur calls 12,000 a moderate swarm; and\r\nhe mentions one which amounted to more than three times that number\r\n(40,000). A swarm seldom or never takes place except when the sun\r\nshines and the air is calm. Sometimes, when every thing seems to\r\nprognosticate swarming, a cloud passing over the sun calms the\r\nagitation; and afterwards, upon his shining forth again, the tumult\r\nis renewed, keeps augmenting, and the swarm departs[194]. On this\r\naccount the confinement of the queens, before related, is observed to\r\nbe more protracted in bad weather.\r\n\r\nThe longest interval between the swarms is from seven to nine days,\r\nwhich usually is the space that intervenes between the first and the\r\nsecond. The next flies sooner, and the last sometimes departs the day\r\nafter that which preceded it. Fifteen or eighteen days, in favourable\r\nweather, are usually sufficient for throwing the four swarms. The old\r\nqueen, when she takes flight with the first swarm, leaves plenty of\r\nbrood in the cells, which soon renew the population[195].\r\n\r\nIt is not without example, though it rarely happens, that a swarm\r\nconducted by the old queen increases so much in the space of three\r\nweeks as to send forth a new colony. Being already impregnated,\r\nshe is in a condition to oviposit as soon as there are cells ready\r\nto receive her eggs: and an all-wise Providence has so ordered it,\r\nthat at this time she lays only such as produce workers. And it is\r\nthe first employment of her subjects to construct cells for this\r\npurpose[196]. The young queens that conduct the secondary swarms\r\nusually pair the day after they are settled in their new abode; when\r\nthe indifference with which their subjects have hitherto treated them\r\nis exchanged for the usual respect and homage.\r\n\r\nWe may suppose that one motive with the bees for following the old\r\nqueen, is their respect for her; but the reasons that induce them to\r\nfollow the virgin queens, to whom they not only appear to manifest no\r\nattachment, but rather the reverse, seem less easy to be assigned.\r\nProbably the high temperature of the hive during these times of\r\ntumultuous agitation may be the principal cause that operates upon\r\nthem. In a populous hive the thermometer commonly stands between 92°\r\nand 97°; but during the tumult that precedes swarming it rises above\r\n104°, a heat intolerable to these animals[197]. This is M. Huber's\r\nopinion. Yet still, though a high temperature will well account for\r\nthe departure of the swarm from the hive with a virgin queen, if\r\nthere were really no attachment, (as he appears to think,) is it not\r\nextraordinary, that when this cause no longer operates upon them,\r\nthey should agglomerate about her, as they always do, be unsettled\r\nand agitated without her, and quiet when she is with them? Is it not\r\nreasonable to suppose that the instinct which teaches them what\r\nis necessary for the preservation of their society,--at the same\r\ntime that it shows them that without a queen that society cannot be\r\npreserved,--impells them in every case to the mode of treating her\r\nwhich will most effectually influence her conduct, and give it that\r\ndirection which is most beneficial to the community?\r\n\r\nYet, with respect to the treatment of queens, instinct does not\r\ninvariably direct the bees to this end. There are certain exceptions,\r\nproduced perhaps by artificial or casual occurrences, in which it\r\nseems to deviate, yet as we should call it amiably, from the rule of\r\nthe public advantage. Retarded queens, which, as I have observed,\r\nlay male eggs only, deposit them in all cells indifferently, even in\r\nroyal ones. These last are treated by the workers as if they were\r\nactually to become queens. Here their instinct seems defective:--it\r\nappears unaccountable that they should know these eggs, as they do,\r\nwhen deposited in workers cells, and give them a convex covering when\r\nabout to assume the pupa; unless, perhaps, the size of the larva\r\ndirects them in this case.\r\n\r\nThe amputation of one of the antennæ of a queen bee appears not to\r\naffect her perceptibly; but cutting off both these important organs\r\nproduces a very striking derangement of all her proceedings--She seems\r\nin a species of delirium, and deprived of all her instincts; every\r\nthing is done at random; yet the respect and homage of the workers\r\ntowards her, though they are received by her with indifference,\r\ncontinue undiminished. If another in the same condition be put in the\r\nhive, the bees do not appear to discover the difference, and treat\r\nthem both alike: but if a perfect one be introduced, even though\r\nfertile, they seize her, keep her in confinement, and treat her very\r\nunhandsomely. One may conjecture from this circumstance, that it is\r\nby those wonderful organs, the antennæ, that the bees know their own\r\nqueen. If two mutilated queens meet, they show not the slightest\r\nsymptom of resentment. While one of these continues in the hive, the\r\nworkers never think of choosing another; but if she leaves it, they do\r\nnot accompany her, probably because the heat is not increased by her\r\nputting them into the preparatory agitation[198].\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[125] _Apis_ **. e. l.

Reaumur (v.\r\n373) observes that some queens are much larger than others; but he\r\nattributes this difference of their size to the state of the eggs in\r\ntheir body.\r\n\r\n[135] As every reader is not aware of the differences of form, &c. that\r\ndistinguish the females, males, and workers from each other (I have\r\nseen the male mistaken for a distinct species, and placed in a cabinet\r\nas _Apis lagopoda_, L.), I shall here subjoin a description of each.--\r\n\r\ni. The _body_ of the _Female_ bee is considerably longer than that of\r\neither the drone or the worker. The prevailing colour in all three is\r\nthe same, black or black-brown; but with respect to the female this\r\ndoes not appear to be invariably the case; for--not to insist upon\r\nVirgil's royal bees glittering with ruddy or golden spots and scales,\r\nwhere allowance must be made for poetic licence--Reaumur affirms,\r\nafter describing some differences of colour in different individuals\r\nof this sex, that a queen may always be distinguished, both from\r\nthe workers and males, by the colour of her body[136]. If this\r\nobservation be restricted to the colour of some parts of her body,\r\nit is correct; but it will not apply to all generally (unless, as I\r\nsuspect may be the case, by the term body he means the abdomen), for,\r\nin all that I have had an opportunity of examining, the prevailing\r\ncolour, as I have stated it, is the same.\r\n\r\nThe _head_ is not larger than that of the workers; but the _tongue_\r\nis shorter and more slender, with straighter _maxillæ_. The\r\n_mandibles_ are forficate, and do not jut out like theirs into a\r\nprominent angle; they are of the colour of pitch with a red tinge,\r\nand terminate in two teeth, the exterior being acute, and the\r\ninterior blunt or truncated. The _labrum_ or upper-lip is fulvous;\r\nand the _antennæ_ are piceous.\r\n\r\nIn the _trunk_, the _tegulæ_ or scales that defend the base of the\r\nwings are rufo-piceous. The _wings_ reach only to the tip of the\r\nthird abdominal segment. The _tarsi_ and the apex of the _tibiæ_ are\r\nrufo-fulvous. The posterior _tibiæ_ are plane above and covered with\r\nshort adpressed hairs, having neither the _corbicula_ (or marginal\r\nfringe of hairs for carrying the masses of pollen) nor the _pecten_;\r\nand the posterior _plantæ_ have neither the brush formed of hairs set\r\nin striæ, nor the auricle at the base.\r\n\r\nThe _abdomen_ is considerably longer than the head and trunk taken\r\ntogether, receding from the trunk, elongato-conical, and rather sharp\r\nat the anus. The _dorsal_ segments are fulvous at the tip; covered\r\nwith very short, pallid, and, in certain lights, shining adpressed\r\nhairs; the first segment being very short, and covered with longer\r\nhairs. The ventral segments, except the _anal_, which is black, are\r\nfulvescent or rufo-fulvous, and covered with soft longer hairs. The\r\n_vagina_ of the _spicula_ (commonly called the sting) is curved.\r\n\r\nii. The _Male_ bee, or drone, is quite the reverse of his royal\r\nparamour; his body being thick, short, and clumsy, and very obtuse\r\nat each extremity[137]. It is covered also, as to the _head_ and\r\n_trunk_, with dense hairs.\r\n\r\nThe _head_ is depressed and orbicular. The _tongue_ is shorter and\r\nmore slender than that of the female; and the _mandibles_, though\r\nnearly of the same shape, are smaller. The _eyes_ are very large,\r\nmeeting at the back part of the head. In the space between them are\r\nplaced the _antennæ_ and _stemmata_. The former consist of fourteen\r\njoints, including the _radicle_, the fourth and fifth being very\r\nshort and not easily distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe _trunk_ is large. The _wings_ are longer than the body. The\r\n_legs_ are short and slender. The _posterior tibiæ_ are long,\r\nclub-shaped, and covered with inconspicuous hairs. The _posterior\r\nplantæ_ are furnished underneath with thick-set _scopulæ_, which they\r\nuse to brush their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe _claw-joints_ are fulvescent.\r\n\r\nThe _abdomen_ is cordate, very short, being scarcely so long as the\r\nhead and trunk together, consisting of seven segments, which are\r\nfulvous at their apex. The first segment is longer than any of the\r\nsucceeding ones, and covered above with rather long hairs. The second\r\nand third dorsal segments are apparently naked; but under a triple\r\nlens, in a certain light, some adpressed hairs may be perceived;--the\r\nremaining ones are hairy, the three last being inflexed. The ventral\r\nsegments are very narrow, hairy, and fulvous.\r\n\r\niii. The _body_ of the _Workers_ is oblong.\r\n\r\nThe _head_ triangular. The _mandibles_ are prominent, so as to\r\nterminate the head in an angle, toothless and forcipate. The _tongue_\r\nand _maxillæ_ are long and incurved: the _labrum_ and _antennæ_ black.\r\n\r\nIn the _trunk_ the _tegulæ_ are black. The _wings_ extend only to\r\nthe apex of the fourth segment of the abdomen. The _legs_ are all\r\nblack, with the _digits_ only rather piceous. The posterior _tibiæ_\r\nare naked above, exteriorly longitudinally concave, and interiorly\r\nlongitudinally convex; furnished with lateral and recumbent hairs\r\nto form the _corbicula_, and armed at the end with the _pecten_.\r\nThe upper surface of the _posterior plantæ_ resembles that of the\r\n_tibiæ_; underneath they are furnished with a _scopula_ or brush\r\nof stiff hairs set in rows: at the base they are armed with stiff\r\nbristles, and exteriorly with an acute appendage or _auricle_.\r\n\r\nThe _abdomen_ is a little longer than the head and trunk together;\r\noblong, and rather heart-shaped--a transverse section of it is\r\ntriangular. It is covered with longish flavo-pallid hairs: the\r\nfirst segment is short with longer hairs; the base of the three\r\nintermediate segments is covered, and as it were banded, with pale\r\nhairs. The apex of the three intermediate ventral segments is rather\r\nfulvescent, and their base is distinguished on each side by a\r\ntrapeziform _wax-pocket_ covered by a thin membrane. The sting, or\r\nrather _vagina_ of the _spicula_, is straight.\r\n\r\n[136] Reaumur, v. 375.\r\n\r\n[137] Virgil seems to have regarded the drone as one of the sorts of\r\nkings or leaders of the bees, when he says, speaking of the latter,\r\n\r\n             \"...

On the 14th,\r\nthree royal cells were observed nearly finished, with a large grub\r\nin each. On the 16th, the three cells were sealed. On the 18th and\r\n21st, they remained in the same state. On the 22d, two queens were\r\nfound hatched, one was removed and the other left with the stock, the\r\nremaining royal cell being still closed. On the morning of the 23d, a\r\ndead queen was thrown out of the hive, upon which examination being\r\nmade, the royal cell left closed on the 22d was found open, and a\r\nliving queen in the stock which was allowed to remain.\r\n\r\n[154] Huber, ii. 445.\r\n\r\n[155] See J.

Much abuse, from the\r\nearliest times, has been lavished upon this description of the\r\ninhabitants of the hive, and their indolence and gluttony have become\r\nproverbial.--Indeed, at first sight, it seems extraordinary that\r\nseven or eight hundred individuals should be supported at the public\r\nexpense, and to common appearance do nothing all the while that may\r\nbe thought to earn their living. But the more we look into nature,\r\nthe more we discover the truth of that common axiom,--that nothing is\r\nmade in vain.--Creative Wisdom cannot be caught at fault. Therefore,\r\nwhere we do not at present perceive the reasons of things, instead of\r\ncavilling at what we do not understand, we ought to adore in silence,\r\nand wait patiently till the veil is removed which, in any particular\r\ninstance, conceals its final cause from our sight. The mysteries\r\nof nature are gradually opened to us, one truth making way for the\r\ndiscovery of another: but still there will always be in nature, as\r\nwell as in revelation, even in those things that fall under our daily\r\nobservation, mysteries to exercise our faith and humility: so that we\r\nmay always reply to the caviller,--\"Thine own things and those that\r\nare grown up with thee hast thou not known; how then shall thy vessel\r\ncomprehend the way of the Highest?\"\r\n\r\nVarious have been the conjectures of naturalists, even in very recent\r\ntimes, with respect to the fertilization of the eggs of the bee. Some\r\nhave supposed,--and the number of males seemed to countenance the\r\nsupposition,--that this was effected after they were deposited in the\r\ncells. Of this opinion Maraldi seems to have been the author, and\r\nit was adopted by Mr. Debraw of Cambridge, who asserts that he has\r\nseen the smaller males (those that are occasionally produced in cells\r\nusually appropriated to workers) introduce their abdomen into cells\r\ncontaining eggs, and fertilize them; and that the eggs so treated\r\nproved fertile, while others that were not remained sterile. The\r\ncommon or large drones, which form the bulk of the male population of\r\nthe hive, could not be generally destined to this office, since their\r\nabdomen, on account of its size, could only be introduced into male\r\nand royal cells. Bonnet, however, saw some motions of one of these\r\ndrones, which, while it passed by those that were empty, appeared to\r\nstrike with its abdomen the mouth of the cells containing eggs[199].\r\nSwammerdam thought that the female was impregnated by effluvia which\r\nissued from the male[200]. Reaumur, from some proceedings that he\r\nwitnessed, was convinced that impregnation took place according to\r\nthe usual law of nature, and, as he supposed, within the hive[201].\r\nThis opinion Huber has confirmed by indubitable proofs; but he\r\nfurther discovered that these animals pair abroad, in the air, during\r\nthe flight of the queen: a fact which renders a large number of males\r\nnecessary, to ensure her impregnation in due time to lay eggs that\r\nwill produce workers[202]. Huber also observed those appearances\r\nwhich induced Debraw to adopt the opinion I mentioned just now, and\r\nwas at first disposed to think them real; but afterwards, upon a\r\nnearer inspection, he discovered that it was an illusion caused by\r\nthe reflection of the rays of light[203].\r\n\r\nIn fine weather the drones, during the warmest part of the day, take\r\ntheir flights; and it is then that they pair with the queen in mid air,\r\nthe result being invariably the death of the drone. No one has yet\r\ndiscovered, unless the proceedings observed by Debraw and Bonnet may\r\nbe so interpreted, that when in the hive they take any share in the\r\nbusiness of it, their great employment within doors being to eat. Their\r\nlife however is of very short duration, the eggs that produce drones\r\nbeing laid in the course of April and May, and their destruction being\r\nusually accomplished in the months of July and August. The bees then,\r\nas M. Huber observes, chase them about, and pursue them to the bottom\r\nof the hives, where they assemble in crowds. At the same time numerous\r\ncarcases of drones may be seen on the ground before the hives. Hence\r\nhe conjectured, though he never could detect them engaged in this\r\nwork upon the combs, that they were stung to death by the workers.\r\nTo ascertain how their death was occasioned, he caused a table to be\r\nglazed, on which he placed six hives, and under this table he employed\r\nthe patient and indefatigable Burnens, who was to him instead of\r\neyes, to watch their proceedings. On the fourth of July this accurate\r\nobserver saw the massacre going on in all the hives at the same time,\r\nand attended by the same circumstances. The table was crowded with\r\nworkers, who, apparently in great rage, darted upon the drones as\r\nsoon as they arrived at the bottom of the hive seizing them by their\r\nantennæ, their legs, and their wings; and killing them by violent\r\nstrokes of their sting, which they generally inserted between the\r\nsegments of the abdomen. The moment this fearful weapon entered their\r\nbody, the poor helpless creatures expanded their wings and expired.\r\nAfter this, as if fearful that they were not sufficiently dispatched,\r\nthe bees repeated their strokes, so that they often found it difficult\r\nto extricate their sting. On the following day they were equally busy\r\nin the work of slaughter; but their fury, their own having perished,\r\nwas chiefly vented upon those drones, which, after having escaped from\r\nthe neighbouring hives, had sought refuge with them. Not content with\r\ndestroying those that were in the perfect state, they attacked also\r\nsuch male pupæ as were left in their cells; and then dragging them\r\nforth, sucked the fluid from their bodies and cast them out of the\r\nhive[204].\r\n\r\nBut though in hives containing a queen perfectly fertile (that is,\r\nwhich lays both worker and male eggs,) this is the unhappy fate of\r\nthe drones; yet in those where the queen only lays male eggs, they\r\nare suffered to remain unmolested; and in hives deprived of their\r\nqueen, they also find a secure asylum[205].\r\n\r\nWhat it is that, in the former instance, excites the fury of the bees\r\nagainst the males, is not easy to discover; but some conjecture may\r\nperhaps be formed from the circumstances last related. When only males\r\nare produced by the queen, the bees seem aware that something more is\r\nwanted, and retain the males; the same is the case when they have no\r\nqueen; and when one is procured, they appear to know that she would not\r\nprofit them without the males. Their fury then is connected with their\r\nutility: when the queen is impregnated, which lasts for her whole life,\r\nas if they knew that the drones could be of no further use, and would\r\nonly consume their winter stores of provision, they destroy them; which\r\nsurely is more merciful than expelling them, in which case they must\r\ninevitably perish from hunger. But when the queen only produces males,\r\ntheir numbers are not sufficient to cause alarm; and the same reasoning\r\napplies to the case when there is no queen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving brought the males from their cradle to their untimely grave,\r\nand amused you with the little that is known of their uneventful\r\nhistory, I shall now, at last, call you to attend to the proceedings\r\nof the _workers_ themselves; and here I am afraid, long as I have\r\ndetained you, I must still press you to expatiate with me in a more\r\nample field; but the spectacles you will behold during our excursion\r\nwill repay, I promise you, any delay or trouble it may occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen I consider the proceedings of these little creatures, both in\r\nthe hive and out of it, they are so numerous and multifarious, that\r\nI scarcely know where to begin. You have already, however, heard\r\nmuch of their internal labours, in the care and nurture of the\r\nyoung; the construction of their combs[206]; and their proceedings\r\nwith respect to their queens and their paramours. It will therefore\r\nchange the scene a little, if we accompany them in their excursions\r\nto collect the various substances of which they have need[207].\r\nOn these occasions the principal object of the bees is to furnish\r\nthemselves with three different materials:--the nectar of flowers,\r\nfrom which they elaborate honey and wax; the pollen or fertilizing\r\ndust of the anthers, of which they make what is called bee-bread,\r\nserving as food both to old and young; and the resinous substance\r\ncalled by the ancients _Propolis_, _Pissoceros_, &c. used in various\r\nways in rendering the hive secure and giving the finish to the combs.\r\nThe first of these substances is the pure fluid secreted in the\r\nnectaries of flowers, which the length of their tongue enables them\r\nto reach in most blossoms. The tongue of a bee, you are to observe,\r\nthough so long and sometimes so inflated[208], is not a tube through\r\nwhich the honey passes, nor a pump acting by suction, but a real\r\ntongue which laps or licks the honey, and passes it down on its upper\r\nsurface, as we do, to the mouth, which is at its base concealed\r\nby the mandibles[209]. It is conveyed by this orifice through the\r\nœsophagus into the first stomach, which we call the honey-bag,\r\nand which, from being very small, is swelled when full of it to a\r\nconsiderable size. Honey is never found in the second stomach, (which\r\nis surrounded with muscular rings, and resembles a cask covered with\r\nhoops from one end to the other,) but only in the first: in the\r\nlatter and the intestines the bee-bread only is discovered. How the\r\nwax is secreted, or what vessels are appropriated to that purpose,\r\nis not yet ascertained. Huber suspects that a cellular substance,\r\nconsisting of hexagons, which lines the membrane of the wax-pockets,\r\nmay be concerned in this operation. This substance he also discovered\r\nin humble-bees (which though they make wax have no wax-pockets),\r\noccupying all the anterior part or base of the segments[210]. If\r\nyou wish to see the wax-pockets in the hive-bee, you must press the\r\nabdomen so as to cause it to extend itself; you will then find on\r\neach of the four intermediate ventral segments, separated by the\r\ncarina or elevated central part, two trapeziform whitish pockets, of\r\na soft membranaceous texture: on these the laminæ of wax are formed,\r\nand they are found upon them in different states, so as to be more\r\nor less perceptible. I must here observe that, besides Thorley, who\r\nseems to have been the first apiarist that observed these laminæ,\r\nWildman was not ignorant of them, nor of the wax being formed from\r\nhoney[211]: we must not therefore permit foreigners to appropriate to\r\nthemselves the whole credit of discoveries that have been made, or at\r\nleast partially made, by our own countrymen.\r\n\r\nLong before Linné had discovered the nectary of flowers, our\r\nindustrious creatures had made themselves intimate with every form\r\nand variety of them; and no botanist, even in this enlightened era\r\nof botanical science, can compare with a bee in this respect. The\r\nstation of these reservoirs, even where the armed sight of science\r\ncannot discover it, is in a moment detected by the microscopic eye of\r\nthis animal.\r\n\r\nShe has to attend to a double task--to collect materials for\r\nbee-bread as well as for honey and wax. Observe a bee that has\r\nalighted upon an open flower. The hum produced by the motion of her\r\nwings ceases, and her employment begins. In an instant she unfolds\r\nher tongue, which before was rolled up under her head. With what\r\nrapidity does she dart this organ between the petals and the stamina!\r\nAt one time she extends it to its full length, then she contracts it;\r\nshe moves it about in all directions, so that it may be applied both\r\nto the concave and convex surface of a petal, and wipe them both; and\r\nthus by a virtuous theft robs it of all its nectar. All the while\r\nthis is going on, she keeps herself in a constant vibratory motion.\r\nThe object of the industrious animal is not, like the more selfish\r\nbutterfly, to appropriate this treasure to herself. It goes into the\r\nhoney-bag as into a laboratory, where it is transformed into pure\r\nhoney; and when she returns to the hive, she regurgitates it in this\r\nform into one of the cells appropriated to that purpose; in order\r\nthat, after tribute is paid from it to the queen, it may constitute a\r\nsupply of food for the rest of the community.\r\n\r\nIn collecting honey, bees do not solely confine themselves to flowers,\r\nthey will sometimes very greedily absorb the sweet juices of fruits:\r\nthis I have frequently observed with respect to the raspberries in\r\nmy garden, and have noticed it, as you may recollect, in a former\r\nletter[212]. They will also eat sugar, and produce wax from it; but\r\nfrom Huber's observations, it appears not calculated to supply the\r\nplace of honey in the jelly with which the larvæ are fed[213]. Though\r\nthe great mass of the food of bees is collected from flowers, they\r\ndo not wholly confine themselves to a vegetable diet; for, besides\r\nthe honeyed secretion of the Aphides, the possession of which they\r\nwill sometimes dispute with the ants[214], upon particular occasions\r\nthey will eat the eggs of the queen. They are very fond also of the\r\nfluid that oozes from the cells of the pupæ, and will suck eagerly\r\nall that is fluid in their abdomen after they are destroyed by their\r\nrivals[215].--Several flowers that produce much honey they pass by;\r\nin some instances, from inability to get at it. Thus, for this reason\r\nprobably, they do not attempt those of the trumpet-honey-suckle,\r\n(_Lonicera sempervirens_,) which, if separated from the germen after\r\nthey are open, will yield two or three drops of the purest nectar.\r\nSo that were this shrub cultivated with that view, much honey in its\r\noriginal state might be obtained from a small number of plants. In\r\nother cases, it appears to be the poisonous quality of their honey that\r\ninduces bees to neglect certain flowers. You have doubtless observed\r\nthe conspicuous white nectaries of the crown imperial, (_Fritillaria\r\nimperialis_,) and that they secrete abundance of this fluid. It tempts\r\nin vain the passing bee, probably aware of some noxious quality that\r\nit possesses. The oleander (_Nerium Oleander_,) yields a honey that\r\nproves fatal to thousands of imprudent flies; but our bees, more wise\r\nand cautious, avoid it. Occasionally, perhaps, in particular seasons,\r\nwhen flowers are less numerous than common, this instinct of the bees\r\nappears to fail them, or to be overpowered by their desire to collect\r\na sufficient store of honey for their purposes, and they suffer for\r\ntheir want of self-denial. Sometimes whole swarms have been destroyed\r\nby merely alighting upon poisonous trees. This happened to one in\r\nthe county of West Chester in the province of New York, which settled\r\nupon the branches of the poison-ash (_Rhus Vernix_). In the following\r\nmorning the imprudent animals were all found dead, and swelled to more\r\nthan double their usual size[216]. Whether the honey extracted from\r\nthe species of the genus _Kalmia_, _Andromeda_, _Rhododendrum_, &c. be\r\nhurtful to the bees themselves, is not ascertained; but, as has been\r\nbefore observed, it is often poisonous to man[217]. The Greeks, as you\r\nprobably recollect, in their celebrated retreat after the death of\r\nthe younger Cyrus, found a kind of honey at Trebisond on the Euxine\r\ncoast, which, though it produced no fatal effects upon them, rendered\r\nthose who ate but little, like men very drunk, and those who ate much,\r\nlike mad men or dying persons; and numbers lay upon the ground as if\r\nthere had been a defeat. Pliny, who mentions this honey, calls it\r\n_Mænomenon_, and observes that it is said to be collected from a kind\r\nof _Rhododendrum_, of which Tournefort noticed two species there[218].\r\n\r\nWhen the stomach of a bee is filled with nectar, it next, by means\r\nof the feathered hairs[219] with which its body is covered, pilfers\r\nfrom the flowers the fertilizing dust of the anthers, the _pollen_;\r\nwhich is equally necessary to the society with the honey, and may be\r\nnamed the ambrosia of the hive, since from it the bee-bread is made.\r\nSometimes a bee is so discoloured with this powder as to look like\r\na different insect, becoming white, yellow, or orange, according to\r\nthe flowers in which it has been busy. Reaumur was urged to visit\r\nthe hives of a gentleman, who on this account thought his bees were\r\ndifferent from the common kind[220]. He suspected, and it proved,\r\nthat the circumstance just mentioned occasioned the mistaken notion.\r\nWhen the body of the bee is covered with farina, with the brushes of\r\nits legs, especially of the hind ones, it wipes it off: not, as we\r\ndo with our dusty clothes, to dissipate and disperse it in the air,\r\nbut to collect every particle of it, and then to knead it and form it\r\ninto two little masses, which she places, one in each, in the baskets\r\nformed by hairs[221] on her hind legs.\r\n\r\nAristotle says that in each journey from the hive, bees attend\r\nonly one species of flower[222]; Reaumur, however, seems to think\r\nthat they fly indiscriminately from one to another: but Mr. Dobbs\r\nin the _Philosophical Transactions_[223], and Butler before him,\r\nasserts that he has frequently followed a bee engaged in collecting\r\npollen, &c. and invariably observed that it continued collecting\r\nfrom the same kind of flowers with which it first began: passing\r\nover other species, however numerous, even though the flower it\r\nfirst selected was scarcer than others. His observations, he thinks,\r\nare confirmed--and the idea seems not unreasonable--by the uniform\r\ncolour of the pellets of pollen, and their different size. Reaumur\r\nhimself tells us that the bees enter the hive, some with yellow\r\npellets, others with red ones, others again with whitish ones, and\r\nthat sometimes they are even green: upon which he observes, that\r\nthis arises from their being collected from particular flowers, the\r\npollen of whose anthers is of those colours[224]. Sprengel, as\r\nbefore intimated[225], has made an observation similar to that of\r\nDobbs. It seems not improbable that the reason why the bee visits\r\nthe same species of plants during one excursion may be this:--Her\r\ninstinct teaches her that the grains of pollen which enter into the\r\nsame mass should be homogeneous, in order perhaps for their more\r\neffectual cohesion; and thus Providence also secures two important\r\nends,--the impregnation of those flowers that require such aid, by\r\nthe bees passing from one to another; and the avoiding the production\r\nof hybrid plants, from the application of the pollen of one kind of\r\nplant to the stigma of another. When the anthers are not yet burst,\r\nthe bee opens them with her mandibles, takes a parcel of pollen,\r\nwhich one of the first pair of legs receives and delivers to the\r\nmiddle pair, from which it passes to one of the hind legs.\r\n\r\nIf the contents of one of the little pellets be examined under a\r\nlens, it will be found that the grains have all retained their\r\noriginal shape. A botanist practised in the figure of the pollen of\r\nthe different species of common plants might easily ascertain, by\r\nsuch an examination, whether a bee had collected its ambrosia from\r\none or more, and also from what species of flowers.\r\n\r\nIn the months of April and May, as Reaumur tells us, the bees collect\r\npollen from morning to evening; but in the warmer months the great\r\ngathering of it is from the time of their first leaving the hive\r\n(which is sometimes so early as four in the morning) to about 10\r\no'clock A.M. About that hour all that enter the hive may be seen\r\nwith their pellets in their baskets; but during the rest of the day\r\nthe number of those so furnished is small in comparison of those\r\nthat are not. In a hive, however, in which a swarm is recently\r\nestablished, it is generally brought in at all parts of the day.\r\nHe supposes, in order for its being formed into pellets, that it\r\nrequires some moisture, which the heat evaporates after the above\r\nhour; but in the case of recently colonized hives, that the bees go a\r\ngreat way to seek it in moist and shady places[226].\r\n\r\nWhen a bee has completed her lading, she returns to the hive to\r\ndispose of it. The honey is disgorged into the honey-pots or cells\r\ndestined to receive it, and is discharged from the honey-bag by\r\nits alternate contraction and dilatation. A cell will contain the\r\ncontents of many honey-bags. When a bee comes to disgorge the honey,\r\nwith its fore legs it breaks the thick cream that is always on the\r\ntop, and the honey which it yields passes under it. This cream is\r\nhoney of a thicker consistence than the rest, which rises to the\r\ntop in the cells like cream on milk: it is not level, but forms an\r\noblique surface over the honey. The cells, as you know, are usually\r\nhorizontal, yet the honey does not run out. The cream, aided probably\r\nby the general thickness of the honey and the attraction of the sides\r\nof the cell, prevents this. Bees, when they bring home the honey,\r\ndo not always disgorge it; they sometimes give it to such of their\r\ncompanions as have been at work within the hive[227]. Some of the\r\ncells are filled with honey for daily use, and some with what is\r\nintended for a reserve, and stored up against bad weather or a bad\r\nseason: these are covered with a waxen lid[228].\r\n\r\nThe pollen is employed as circumstances direct. When the bee laden with\r\nit arrives at the hive, she sometimes stops at the entrance, and very\r\nleisurely detaching it by piecemeal, devours one or both the pellets on\r\nher legs, chewing them with her jaws, and passing them then down the\r\nlittle orifice before noticed. Sometimes she enters the hive, and walks\r\nupon the combs; and whether she walks or stands, still keeps beating\r\nher wings. By the noise thus produced, which seems a call to some of\r\nher fellow-citizens, three or four go to her, and placing themselves\r\naround her, begin to lighten her of her load, each taking and devouring\r\na small portion of her ambrosia: this they repeat, if more do not\r\narrive to assist them, three or four times, till the whole is disposed\r\nof[229]. Wildman observed them on this occasion supporting themselves\r\nupon their two fore feet; and making several motions with their wings\r\nand body to the right and left, which produced the sound that summoned\r\ntheir assistants[230]. This bee-bread, as I said before, is generally\r\nfound in the second stomach and intestines, but the honey never; which\r\ninduced Reaumur to think (but he was mistaken) that the bees elaborated\r\nwax from it: and he observes, that the bees devour this when they\r\nare busily engaged in constructing combs[231]. When more pollen is\r\ncollected than the bees have immediate occasion for, they store it up\r\nin some of the empty cells. The laden bee puts her two hind legs into\r\nthe cell, and with the intermediate pair pushes off the pellets. When\r\nthis is done, she, or another bee if she is too much fatigued with\r\nher day's labour, enters the cell with her head first, and remains\r\nthere some time: she is engaged in diluting the pellets, kneading\r\nthem, and packing them close; and so they proceed till the cell is\r\nfilled[232]. A large portion of the cells of some combs are filled with\r\nthis bread, which one while is found in insulated cells, at another in\r\ncells amongst those that are filled with honey or brood.--Thus it is\r\neverywhere at hand for use.\r\n\r\nYou have seen how the bees collect and employ two of the materials that\r\nI mentioned; I must now advert to the third--the _Propolis_. Huber was\r\na long time uncertain from whence the bees procured this gummy resin;\r\nbut it at last occurred to him to plant some cuttings of a species of\r\npoplar (before their leaves were developed, when their leaf-buds were\r\nswelling, and besmeared and filled with a viscid juice,) in some pots,\r\nwhich he placed in the way of the bees that went from his hives. Almost\r\nimmediately a bee alighted upon a twig, and soon with its mandibles\r\nopened a bud, and drew from it a thread of the viscid matter which it\r\ncontained; with one of its second pair of legs it took it from the\r\nmouth, and placed it in the basket: thus it proceeded till it had given\r\nthem both their load[233]. I have myself seen bees very busy collecting\r\nit from the Tacamahaca (_Populus balsamifera_). But this is an old\r\ndiscovery, confirmed by recent observation; for Mouffet tells us from\r\nCordus, that it is collected from the gems of trees, instancing the\r\npoplar and the birch[234]. Riem observes that it is also collected from\r\nthe pine and fir. The propolis is soft, red, will pull out in a thread,\r\nis aromatic, and imparts a gold colour to white polished metals. It\r\nis employed in the hive not only in finishing the combs, as I related\r\nin my letter on Habitations[235]; but also in stopping every chink\r\nor orifice by which cold, wet, or any enemy, can enter. They cover\r\nlikewise with it the sticks which support the combs, and often spread\r\nit over a considerable portion of the interior of the hive. Like the\r\npellets of pollen, it is carried on the posterior tibiæ, but the masses\r\nare lenticular[236].\r\n\r\nMr. Knight mentions an instance of bees using an artificial kind of\r\npropolis. He had caused the decorticated part of some tree to be\r\ncovered with a cement composed of bees-wax and turpentine: finding\r\nthis to their purpose, they attacked it, detaching it from the tree\r\nby their mandibles, and then, as usual, passing it from the first leg\r\nto the second, and so to the third. When one bee had thus collected\r\nits load, another often came behind and despoiled it of all it had\r\ncollected; a second and third load were frequently lost in the same\r\nmanner; and yet the patient animal pursued its labours without\r\nshowing any signs of anger[237].\r\n\r\nBees in their excursions do not confine themselves to the spot\r\nimmediately contiguous to their dwelling, but, when led by the scent\r\nof honey, will go a mile from it. Huber even assigns to them a radius\r\nof half a league round their hive for their ordinary excursions; yet\r\nfrom this distance they will discover honey with as much certainty as\r\nif it was within their sight. To prove that it is by their scent that\r\nbees find it out, he put some behind a window-shutter, in a place\r\nwhere it could not be seen, leaving the shutter just open enough for\r\ninsects, if they liked, to get at it. In less than a quarter of an\r\nhour four bees, a butterfly, and some house-flies had discovered it.\r\nAt another time he put some into boxes, with little apertures in the\r\nlid, into which pieces of card were fitted, which he placed about\r\ntwo hundred paces from his hives. In about half an hour the bees\r\ndiscovered them, and traversing them very industriously, soon found\r\nthe apertures, when, pushing in the pieces of card, they got to the\r\nhoney. That contained in the blossom of many plants is quite as much\r\nconcealed, yet the acuteness of their scent enables them to detect it.\r\n\r\nThese insects, especially when laden and returning to their nest,\r\nfly in a direct line, which saves both time and labour. How they are\r\nenabled to do this with such certainty as to make for their own abode\r\nwithout deviation, I must leave to others to explain. Connected with\r\nthis circumstance, and the acuteness of their smell, is the following\r\ncurious account, given in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1721,\r\nof the method practised in New England for discovering where the\r\nwild hive-bees live in the woods, in order to get their honey. The\r\nhoney-hunters set a plate containing honey or sugar upon the ground in\r\na clear day. The bees soon discover and attack it: having secured two\r\nor three that have filled themselves, the hunter lets one go, which\r\nrising into the air, flies straight to the nest: he then strikes off at\r\nright angles with its course a few hundred yards, and letting a second\r\nfly, observes its course by his pocket-compass, and the point where the\r\ntwo courses intersect is that where the nest is situated[238].\r\n\r\nThe natural station of bees is in the cavities of decayed trees;\r\nsuch trees, Mr. Knight tells us, they will discover in the closest\r\nrecesses, and at an extraordinary distance from the hive; in one\r\ninstance it was a mile: and at swarming, they sometimes are inclined\r\nto settle in such cavities. After the discovery of one, from twenty\r\nto fifty, who are a kind of scouts, may be found examining and\r\nkeeping possession of it. They seem to explore every part of it and\r\nof the tree with the greatest attention, even surveying the dead\r\nknots and the like[239]. When a hive stands unemployed, a swarm will\r\nalso sometimes send scouts to take possession of it.\r\n\r\nHow long our little active creatures repose before they take a second\r\nexcursion I cannot precisely say. In a hive the greatest part of the\r\ninhabitants generally appear in repose, lying together, says Reaumur,\r\nbut this probably for a short time. Huber tells us, that bees may\r\nalways be observed in a hive with the head and thorax inserted into\r\ncells that contain eggs, and sometimes into empty ones: and that they\r\nremain in this situation fifteen or twenty minutes so motionless,\r\nthat did not the dilatation of the segments of the abdomen prove the\r\ncontrary, they might be mistaken for dead. He supposes their object is\r\nrepose from their labours[240]. The queen, for this purpose, enters\r\nthe large cells of the males, and continues in them without motion a\r\nvery long time. Even then the workers form a circle round her, and\r\nbrush the uncovered part of her abdomen. The drones while reposing do\r\nnot enter the cells, but cluster in the combs, and sometimes remain\r\nwithout stirring a limb for eighteen or twenty hours[241].\r\n\r\nReaumur observes, that in a hive the population of which amounts to\r\n18,000, the number that enter the hive in a minute is a hundred;\r\nwhich, allowing fourteen hours in the day for their labour, makes\r\n84,000: thus every individual must make four excursions daily, and\r\nsome five. In hives where the population was smaller, the numbers\r\nthat entered were comparatively greater, so as to give six excursions\r\nor more to each bee[242]. But in this calculation Reaumur does not\r\nseem to take into the account those that are employed within the\r\nhive in building or feeding the young brood; which must render the\r\nexcursions of each bee still more numerous. He proceeds further to\r\nground upon this statement a calculation of the quantity of bee-bread\r\nthat may be collected in one day by such a hive; and he found,\r\nsupposing only half the number to collect it, that it would amount\r\nto more than a pound; so that in one season, one such hive might\r\ncollect a hundred pounds[243]. What a wonderful idea does this give\r\nof the industry and activity of these little useful creatures! And\r\nwhat a lesson do they read to the members of societies that have both\r\nreason and religion to guide their exertions for the common good!\r\nAdorable is that Great Being who has gifted them with instincts,\r\nwhich render them as instructive to us, if we will condescend to\r\nlisten to them, as they are profitable.\r\n\r\nWhile I am upon this part of the story of bees, I cannot pass over\r\nthe account Reaumur has given from Maillet of the transportation of\r\nhives in Egypt from one place to another, before alluded to[244],\r\nto enable them to make in greater abundance their collections of\r\nhoney, &c. Towards the end of October, when the inundations of the\r\nNile have ceased, and the husbandmen can sow their land, saintfoin is\r\none of the first things that is sown; and as Upper Egypt is warmer\r\nthan the Lower, the saintfoin gets there first into blossom. At this\r\ntime, bee-hives are transported in boats from all parts of Egypt into\r\nthe upper district, and are there heaped in pyramids upon the boats\r\nprepared to receive them; each being numbered by the individual to\r\nwhom it belongs. In this station they remain some days; and when they\r\nare judged to have got in the harvest of honey and pollen that is to\r\nbe collected there, they are removed two or three leagues lower down,\r\nwhere they remain the same time; and so they proceed till towards the\r\nmiddle of February, when having traversed Egypt, they arrive at the\r\nsea, from whence they are dispersed to their several owners.\r\n\r\nJohn Hunter observes, that when the season for laying is over,\r\nthat for collecting honey comes on (he means, probably, for making\r\nthe principal collection of it); and that when the last pupa is\r\ndisclosed, the cell it deserts, after being cleaned, is immediately\r\nfilled with it; and as soon as full is covered with pure wax: but\r\nthis only holds with respect to the cells containing honey for\r\nwinter use, those destined to receive that which forms their food\r\nwhen bad weather prevents them from going out, being left open[245].\r\nSometimes, when the year is remarkably favourable for collecting\r\nhoney, the bees will destroy many of the larvæ to make room for it;\r\nbut they never meddle with the pupæ. When no more honey is to be\r\ncollected, they remain quiet in the hive for the winter. Mr. Hunter\r\nfound that a hive grew lighter in a cold than in a warm week; he\r\nfound also, that in three months (from November 10th to February 9th)\r\na single hive lost 72 oz. 1-1/2 dram[246].\r\n\r\nWater is a thing of the first necessity to these insects; but they\r\nare not very delicate as to its quality, but rather the reverse;\r\noften preferring what is stagnant and putrescent, to that of a\r\nrunning stream[247]. I have frequently observed them busy in corners\r\nmoist with urine; perhaps this is for the sake of the saline\r\nparticles to be there collected.\r\n\r\nA new-born bee, as soon as it is able to use its wings, seems perfectly\r\naware, without any previous instruction, what are to be its duties\r\nand employments for the rest of its life. It appears to know that\r\nit is born for society, and not for selfish pursuits; and therefore\r\nit invariably devotes itself and its labours to the benefit of the\r\ncommunity to which it belongs. Walking upon the combs, it seeks for the\r\ndoor of the hive, that it may sally forth and be useful. Full of life\r\nand activity, it then takes its first flight; and, unconducted but by\r\nits instinct, visits like the rest the subjects of Flora, absorbs their\r\nnectar, covers itself with their ambrosial dust, which it kneads into\r\na mass and packs upon its hind legs; and if need be, gathers propolis,\r\nand returns unembarrassed to its own hive[248].\r\n\r\nInstances of the expedition with which our little favourites\r\naccomplish their various objects you have had several; but this is\r\nnever more remarkable than when they settle in a new hive. At this\r\ntime, in twenty-four hours they will sometimes construct a comb\r\ntwenty inches long by seven or eight wide; and the hive will be half\r\nfilled in five or six days; so that in the first fifteen days as much\r\nwax is made as in the whole year besides[249].\r\n\r\nIn treating of the various employments of the bees, I must not omit\r\none of the greatest importance to them--the _ventilation_ of their\r\nabode. When you consider the numbers contained in so confined a\r\nspace; the high temperature to which its atmosphere is raised; and\r\nthe small aperture at which the air principally enters, you will\r\nreadily conceive how soon it must be rendered unfit for respiration,\r\nand be convinced that there must be some means of constantly\r\nrenewing it. If you feel disposed to think that the ventilation\r\ntakes place, as in our apartments, by natural means, resulting\r\nfrom the rarefaction of the air by the heat of the hive, and the\r\nconsequent establishment of an interior and exterior current--a\r\nsimple experiment will satisfy you that this cannot be. Take a vessel\r\nof the size of a bee-hive, with a similar or even somewhat larger\r\naperture--introduce a lighted taper, and if the temperature be raised\r\nto more than 140°, it will go out in a short time. We must therefore\r\nadmit, as Huber observes[250], that the bees possess the astonishing\r\nfaculty of attracting the external air, and at the same time of\r\nexpelling that which has become corrupted by their respiration.\r\n\r\nWhat would you say, should I tell you that the bees upon this\r\noccasion have recourse to the same instrument which ladies use to\r\ncool themselves when an apartment is overheated? Yet it is strictly\r\nthe case. By means of their marginal hooks, they unite each pair of\r\nwings into one plane slightly concave, thus acting upon the air by\r\na surface nearly as large as possible, and forming for them a pair\r\nof very ample fans, which in their vibrations describe an arch of\r\n90°. These vibrations are so rapid as to render the wings almost\r\ninvisible. When they are engaged in ventilation, the bees by means\r\nof their feet and claws fix themselves as firmly as possible to\r\nthe place they stand upon. The first pair of legs is stretched out\r\nbefore; the second extended to the right and left; whilst the third,\r\nplaced very near each other, are perpendicular to the abdomen, so as\r\nto give that part considerable elevation.\r\n\r\nMaraldi, and after him Reaumur, long ago noticed this action of the\r\nbees; but they attributed to it an effect the reverse of that which\r\nit really produces; the former imagining it to occasion directly the\r\nhigh temperature of the hive, and the latter indirectly[251]. It was\r\nreserved for Huber to discover the true cause of it; and from him the\r\nchief of what I have to say upon the subject will be derived[252].\r\n\r\nDuring the summer a certain number of workers--for it is to the\r\nworkers solely that this office is committed--may always be observed\r\nvibrating their wings before the entrance of their hive; and the\r\nobservant apiarist will find upon examination, that a still greater\r\nnumber are engaged within it in the same employment. All those thus\r\ncircumstanced that stand without, turn their head to the entrance;\r\nwhile those that stand within, turn their back to it. The station of\r\nthese ventilators is upon the floor of the hive. They are usually\r\nranged in files, that terminate at the entrance; and sometimes, but\r\nnot constantly, form so many diverging rays, probably to give room\r\nfor comers and goers to pass. The number of ventilators in action at\r\nthe same time varies: it seldom much exceeds twenty, and is often\r\nmore circumscribed. The time also that they devote to this function\r\nis longer or shorter according to circumstances: some have been\r\nobserved to continue their vibrations for nearly half an hour without\r\nresting, suspending the action for not more than an instant, as it\r\nshould seem to take breath. When one retires, another occupies its\r\nplace; so that in a hive well peopled there is never any interruption\r\nof the sound or humming occasioned by this action; by which it may\r\nalways be known whether it be going on or not.\r\n\r\nThis humming is observable not only during the heats of summer, but\r\nat all seasons of the year. It sometimes seems even more forcible in\r\nthe depth of winter than when the temperature of the atmosphere is\r\nhigher. An employment so constant, which always occupies a certain\r\nnumber of bees, must produce as constant an effect. The column of air\r\nonce disturbed within, must give place to that without the hive; thus\r\na current being established, the ventilation will be perpetual and\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nTo be convinced that such an effect is produced, approach your hand\r\nto a ventilating bee, and you will find that she causes a very\r\nperceptible motion in the air. Huber tried an experiment still more\r\nsatisfactory. On a calm day, at the time when the bees had returned\r\nto their habitation--having fixed a screen before the mouth of the\r\nhive to prevent his being misled by any sudden motion of the external\r\nair--he placed within the screen little anemometers or wind-gauges,\r\nmade of bits of paper, feather, or cotton, suspended by a thread to\r\na crotch. No sooner did they enter the atmosphere of the bees than\r\nthey were put in motion, being alternately attracted and repelled\r\nto and from the aperture of the hive with considerable rapidity.\r\nThese attractions and repulsions were proportioned to the number of\r\nbees engaged in ventilation, and, though sometimes less perceptible,\r\nwere never intirely suspended. Burnens tried a similar experiment in\r\nthe winter, when the thermometer stood in the shade at 33°. Having\r\nselected a well-peopled hive, the inhabitants of which appeared\r\nfull of life and sufficiently active in the interior, and luted it\r\nall around, except the aperture to the platform on which it stood,\r\nhe stuck in the top a piece of iron wire which terminated in a\r\nhook, to which he fastened a hair with a small square of very thin\r\npaper at the other end; this was exactly opposite to the aperture,\r\nat the distance of about an inch from it. As soon as the apparatus\r\nwas fixed, the hair with its paper pendulum began to oscillate more\r\nor less, the greatest oscillations on both sides being an inch, by\r\nadmeasurement, from the perpendicular: if the paper was moved by\r\nforce to a greater distance, the vibrations did not take place, and\r\nthe apparatus remained at rest. He then made an opening in the top\r\nof the hive, and poured in some liquid honey: soon after there arose\r\na hum, the movement in the interior increased, and some bees came\r\nout. The oscillations of the pendulum upon this became more frequent\r\nand intense, and extended to fifteen lines or an inch and a quarter\r\nfrom the perpendicular; but when the paper was removed to a greater\r\ndistance from the aperture, it remained at rest.\r\n\r\nHuber, at the proposal of M. de Saussure, in order to ascertain\r\nwhether artificial ventilators would produce an analogous effect,\r\ngot a mechanical friend to construct for him a little mill with\r\neighteen sails of tin. He also prepared a large cylindrical vase,\r\ninto which he could, at an aperture in the box upon which it was\r\nfixed, introduce a lighted taper. In one side of this box was another\r\naperture to represent that of a hive, but larger. The ventilator was\r\nplaced below, and luted at the points of contact, and anemometers\r\nwere suspended before the aperture. The first experiment was the\r\nintroduction of the taper, without putting the ventilator in motion.\r\nThough the capacity of the vessel was about 3228 cubic inches, the\r\nflame soon diminished, and went out in about eight minutes, and\r\nthe anemometers continued motionless. The same experiment was\r\nnext repeated with the door shut, with precisely the same result.\r\nAfter the air of the vessel had been renewed, the taper was again\r\nintroduced, and the ventilator set in motion: immediately, as\r\nappeared by the oscillations of the anemometers, two currents of air\r\nwere established, and the brilliancy of the flame was not diminished\r\nduring the whole course of the experiment, which might have been\r\nprolonged for an indefinite time. A thermometer placed in the lower\r\npart of the apparatus rose to 112°; and the temperature was evidently\r\nstill more elevated at the top of the receiver.\r\n\r\nThe Creator often has one end in view in the actions of animals,\r\n(and nothing more conspicuously displays the invisible hand that\r\ngoverns the universe,) while the agents themselves have another.\r\nThis probably is the case in the present instance, since we can\r\nscarcely suppose that the bees beat the air with their wings in\r\norder to ventilate the hive, but rather to relieve themselves from\r\nsome disagreeable sensation which oppresses them. The following\r\nexperiments prove that one of their objects in this action, as it is\r\nwith ladies when they use their fans, is to cool themselves when they\r\nsuffer from too great heat. When Huber once opened the shutter of a\r\nglazed hive, so that the solar rays darted upon the combs covered\r\nwith bees, a humming, the sign of ventilation, soon was heard amongst\r\nthem, while those which were in the shade remained tranquil. The\r\nbees composing the clusters which often are suspended from the hives\r\nin summer, when they are incommoded by the heat of the sun, fan\r\nthemselves with great energy. But if by any means a shadow is cast\r\nover any portion of the group, the ventilation ceases there, while\r\nit continues in the part which feels the heat of the sun. The same\r\ncause produces a similar effect upon humble-bees, wasps, and hornets.\r\n\r\nAmongst the bees, however, it is remarkable that ventilation goes on\r\neven in the depth of winter, when it cannot be occasioned by excess\r\nof heat.--This therefore can only be regarded as a secondary cause\r\nof the phenomenon. From other experiments, which, having already\r\ndetained you too long, I shall not here detail, it appears that\r\npenetrating and disagreeable odours produce the same effect[253].\r\nPerhaps, though Huber does not say this, the odour produced by the\r\ncongregated myriads of the hive may be amongst the principal motives\r\nthat impel its inhabitants to this necessary action.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the proximate cause, it is I trust now evident to you,\r\nthat the Author of nature, having assigned to these insects a\r\nhabitation into which the air cannot easily penetrate, has gifted\r\nthem with the means of preventing the fatal effects which would\r\nresult from corrupted air. An indirect effect of ventilation is\r\nthe elevated temperature which these animals maintain, without any\r\neffort, in their hive:--but upon this I shall enlarge hereafter.\r\n\r\nBees are extremely neat in their persons and habitations, and remove\r\nall nuisances with great assiduity, at least as far as their powers\r\nenable them. Sometimes slugs or snails will creep into a hive, which\r\nwith all their address they cannot readily expel or carry out. But\r\nhere their instinct is at no loss; for they kill them, and afterwards\r\nembalm them with propolis, so as to prevent any offensive odours\r\nfrom incommoding them. An unhappy snail, that had travelled up the\r\nsides of a glazed hive, and which they could not come at with their\r\nstings, they fixed, a monument of their vengeance and dexterity, by\r\nlaying this substance all around the mouth of its shell[254]. When\r\nthey expel their excrements, they go apart that they may not defile\r\ntheir companions: and in winter, when prevented by extreme cold, or\r\nthe injudicious practice of wholly closing the door of the hive, from\r\ngoing out for this purpose, their bodies sometimes become so swelled\r\nfrom the accumulation of feces in the intestines, that when at last\r\nable to get out they can no longer fly, so that falling to the ground\r\nin the attempt, they perish with cold, the sacrifice of personal\r\nneatness[255]. When a bee is disclosed from the pupa and has left its\r\ncell, a worker comes, and taking out its envelope carries it from the\r\nhive; another removes the exuviæ of the larva, and a third any filth\r\nor ordure that may remain, or any pieces of wax that may have fallen\r\nin when the nascent imago broke from its confinement. But they never\r\nattempt to remove the internal lining of silk that covers the walls,\r\nspun by the larva previous to its metamorphosis, because, instead of\r\nbeing a nuisance, it renders the cell more solid[256].\r\n\r\nHaving now described to you the usual employments of my little\r\nfavourites both within doors and without, I shall next enlarge a\r\nlittle upon their language, memory, tempers, manners, and some other\r\nparts of their history.\r\n\r\n\"Brutes\" (it is the remark of Mr. Knight) \"have language to express\r\nsentiments of love, of fear, of anger; but they seem unable to\r\ntransmit any impression they have received from external objects.\r\nBut the language of bees is more extensive; if not a language of\r\nideas, it is something very similar[257].\" You have seen above that\r\nthe organ of the language of ants is their antennæ. Huber has proved\r\nsatisfactorily, that these parts have the same use with the bees. He\r\nwished to ascertain whether, when they had lost a queen (intelligence\r\nwhich traverses a whole hive in about an hour) they discovered the\r\nsad event by their smell, their touch, or any unknown cause. He first\r\ndivided a hive by a grate, which kept the two portions about three or\r\nfour lines apart; so that they could not come at each other, though\r\nscent would pass. In that part in which there was no queen, the bees\r\nwere soon in great agitation; and as they did not discover her where\r\nshe was confined, in a short time they began to construct royal\r\ncells, which quieted them. He next separated them by a partition\r\nthrough which they could pass their antennæ, but not their heads. In\r\nthis case the bees all remained tranquil, neither intermitting the\r\ncare of the brood, nor abandoning their other employments; nor did\r\nthey begin any royal cell. The means they used to assure themselves\r\nthat their queen was in their vicinity and to communicate with her,\r\nwas to pass their antennæ through the openings of the grate. An\r\ninfinite number of these organs might be seen at once, as it were,\r\ninquiring in all directions; and the queen was observed answering\r\nthese anxious inquiries of her subjects in the most marked manner;\r\nfor she was always fastened by her feet to the grate, crossing her\r\nantennæ with those of the inquirers. Various other experiments,\r\nwhich are too long to relate, prove the importance of these organs as\r\nthe instrument of communicating with each other, as well as to direct\r\nthe bee in all its proceedings[258]. Besides their antennæ, the bees\r\nalso cause themselves to be understood by certain sounds, not indeed\r\nproduced by the mouth, but by other parts of their body:--but upon\r\nthis subject I shall have occasion to enlarge hereafter.\r\n\r\nThat bees can remember agreeable sensations at least, is evident from\r\nthe following anecdote related by Huber.--One autumn some honey was\r\nplaced upon a window--the bees attended it in crowds. The honey was\r\ntaken away, and the window closed with a shutter all the winter. In\r\nthe spring, when it was re-opened, the bees returned, though no fresh\r\nhoney had been placed there[259].\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times our little citizens of the hive have had\r\nthe character of being an irritable race. Their anger is without\r\nbounds, says Virgil; and if they are molested, this character is no\r\nexaggeration. Some individuals, however, they will suffer to go near\r\ntheir hives, and to do almost any thing: and there are others to\r\nwhom they seem to take such an antipathy, that they will attack them\r\nunprovoked. A great deal will probably depend upon this--whether any\r\nthing has happened to put them out of humour. The bees usually do not\r\nattack me; but I remember one day last year, when the asparagus was in\r\nblossom, which a large number were attending, I happened to go between\r\nmy asparagus beds; which discomposed them so much, that I was obliged\r\nto retreat with hasty steps, and some of them flew after me; I escaped\r\nhowever unstung. Thorley relates an anecdote of a gentleman, who,\r\ndesirous of securing a swarm of bees that had settled in a hollow tree,\r\nrashly undertook to dislodge them. He succeeded; but though he had\r\nused the precaution of securing his head and hands, he was so stung by\r\nthe furious animals, that a violent fever was the consequence, and his\r\nrecovery was for some time doubtful. The strength of his constitution\r\nat length prevailed; and the hole of the tree being stopped, the\r\nsurvivors of the battle settled upon a branch, were hived, and became\r\nthe dear-bought property of their conqueror[260].\r\n\r\nIn Mungo Park's last mission to Africa, he was much annoyed by\r\nthe attack of bees, probably of the same tribe with our hive-bee.\r\nHis people, in search of honey, disturbed a large colony of them.\r\nThe bees sallied forth by myriads, and attacking men and beasts\r\nindiscriminately, put them all to the rout. One horse and six asses\r\nwere either killed or missing in consequence of their attack; and for\r\nhalf an hour the bees seemed to have completely put an end to their\r\njourney. Isaaco upon another occasion lost one of his asses, and one\r\nof his men was almost killed by them[261].\r\n\r\nBees, however, if they are not molested, are not usually\r\nill-tempered: if you make a captive of their queen, they will cluster\r\nupon your head, or any other part of your body, and never attempt to\r\nsting you. I remember, when a boy, seeing the celebrated Wildman\r\nexhibit many feats of this kind, to the great astonishment and\r\napprehension of the uninformed spectators. The writer lately quoted\r\n(Thorley) was assisted once by his maidservant to hive a swarm. Being\r\nrather afraid, she put a linen cloth as a defence over her head and\r\nshoulders. When the bees were shaken from the tree on which they had\r\nalighted, the queen probably settled upon this cloth; for the whole\r\nswarm covered it, and then getting under it, spread themselves over\r\nher face, neck, and bosom, so that when the cloth was removed she was\r\nquite a spectacle. She was with great difficulty kept from running\r\noff with all the bees upon her; but at length her master quieted her\r\nfears, and began to search for the queen. He succeeded; and hoped\r\nwhen he put her into the hive that the bees would follow; but they\r\nonly seemed to cluster more closely. Upon a second search he found\r\nanother queen, (unless the same had escaped and returned,) whom\r\nseizing, he placed in the hive. The bees soon missed her, and crowded\r\nafter her into it: so that in the space of two or three minutes\r\nnot one was left upon the poor terrified girl. After this escape,\r\nshe became quite a heroine, and would undertake the most hazardous\r\nemployments about the hives[262].\r\n\r\nMany means have been had recourse to for the dispersion of mobs and the\r\nallaying of popular tumults. In St. Petersburgh (so travellers say)\r\na fire-engine playing upon them does not always cool their choler;\r\nbut were a few hives of bees thus employed, their discomfiture would\r\nbe certain. The experiment has been tried. Lesser tells us, that\r\nin 1525, during the confusion occasioned by a time of war, a mob of\r\npeasants assembling in Hohnstein (in Thuringia) attempted to pillage\r\nthe house of the minister of Elende; who having in vain employed all\r\nhis eloquence to dissuade them from their design, ordered his domestics\r\nto fetch his bee-hives, and throw them in the middle of this furious\r\nmob. The effect was what might be expected; they were immediately put\r\nto flight, and happy if they escaped unstung[263].\r\n\r\nThe anger of bees is not confined to man; it is not seldom excited\r\nagainst their own species. From what I have said above respecting the\r\nblack bees[264] and their fate, it seems not improbable that, when\r\nthe workers become too old to be useful to the community, they are\r\neither killed, or expelled from the society. Reaumur, who observed\r\nthat the inhabitants of the same hive had often mortal combats, was\r\nof opinion that this was their object in these battles[265], which\r\ntake place, he observes, in fine or warm weather. On these occasions\r\nthe bees are sometimes so eager, that examining them with a lens does\r\nnot part them:--their whole object is to pierce each other with their\r\nsting, the stroke of which, if once it penetrates to the muscles,\r\nis mortal. In these engagements the conqueror is not always able to\r\nextricate this weapon, and then both perish. The duration of the\r\nconflict is uncertain; sometimes it lasts an hour, and at others is\r\nvery soon determined: and occasionally it happens that both parties,\r\nfatigued and despairing of victory, give up the contest and fly away.\r\n\r\nBut the wars of bees are not confined to single combats; general\r\nactions now and then take place between two swarms. This happens when\r\none takes a fancy to a hive that another has pre-occupied. In fine warm\r\nweather, strangers, that wish to be received amongst them, meet with\r\nbut an indifferent welcome, and a bloody battle is the consequence.\r\nReaumur witnessed one that lasted a whole afternoon, in which many\r\nvictims fell. In this case the battle is still between individuals, who\r\nat one time decide the business within the hive, and at another at some\r\ndistance without. In the former case the victorious bee flies away,\r\nbearing her victim under her body between her legs, sometimes taking a\r\nlonger and sometimes a shorter flight before she deposits it upon the\r\nground.--She then takes her repose near the dead body, standing upon\r\nher four anterior legs, and rubbing the two hinder ones against each\r\nother. If the battle is not concluded within the hive, the enemy is\r\ncarried to a little distance, and then dispatched.\r\n\r\nThis strange fury however does not always show itself on this\r\noccasion; for now and then some friendly intercourse seems to take\r\nplace. Bees, from a hive in Mr. Knight's garden, visited those in\r\nthat of a cottager, a hundred yards distant, considerably later\r\nthan their usual time of labour, every bee as it arrived appearing\r\nto be questioned. On the tenth morning, however, the intercourse\r\nceased, ending in a furious battle. On another occasion, an intimacy\r\ntook place between two hives of his own, at twice the distance,\r\nwhich ceased on the fifth day. Sometimes he observed that this\r\ncommunication terminated in the union of two swarms; as in one\r\ninstance, where a swarm had taken possession of a hollow tree[266],\r\nit is probable that the reception of one swarm by another may depend\r\nupon their numbers, and the fitness of their station to accommodate\r\nthem. Thorley witnessed a battle of more than two days continuance,\r\noccasioned by a strange swarm forcing their way into a hive[267]. Two\r\nswarms that rise at the same time sometimes fight till great numbers\r\nhave been destroyed, or one of the queens slain, when both sides\r\ncease all their enmity and unite under the survivor[268].\r\n\r\nThese apiarian battles are often fought in defence of the property of\r\nthe hive. Bees that are ill managed, and not properly fed, instead\r\nof collecting for themselves, will now and then get a habit of\r\npillaging from their more industrious neighbours: these are called by\r\nSchirach _corsair_ bees, and by English writers, _robbers_. They make\r\ntheir attack chiefly in the latter end of July, and during the month\r\nof August. At first they act with caution, endeavouring to enter by\r\nstealth; and then, emboldened by success, come in a body. If one of\r\nthe queens be killed, the attacked bees unite with the assailants,\r\ntake up their abode with them, and assist in plundering their late\r\nhabitation[269]. Schirach very gravely recommends it to apiarists\r\nwhose hives are attacked by these depredators, to give the bees\r\nsome honey mixed with brandy or wine, to increase and inflame their\r\ncourage, that they may more resolutely defend their property against\r\ntheir piratical assailants[270]. It is however to be apprehended that\r\nthis method of making them pot-valiant might induce them to attack\r\ntheir neighbours, as well as to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nSometimes combats take place in which three or four bees attack a\r\nsingle individual, not with a design to kill, but merely to rob: one\r\nseizes it by one leg, another by another; till perhaps there are\r\ntwo on each side, each having hold of a leg, or they bite its head\r\nor thorax. But as soon as the poor animal that is thus haled about\r\nand maltreated unfolds its tongue, one of the assailants goes and\r\nsucks it with its own, and is followed by the rest, who then let\r\nit go. These insects, however, in their ordinary labours are very\r\nkind and helpful to each other; I have often seen two, at the same\r\nmoment, visit the same flower, and very peaceably despoil it of its\r\ntreasures, without any contention for the best share.\r\n\r\nAs the poison of bees exhales a penetrating odour, M. Huber was\r\ncurious to observe the effect it might produce upon them. Having\r\nextracted with pincers the sting of a bee and its appendages\r\nimpregnated with poison, he presented it to some workers, which\r\nwere settled very tranquilly before the gate of their mansion.\r\nInstantaneously the little party was alarmed; none however took\r\nflight, but two or three darted upon the poisoned instrument, and\r\none angrily attacked the observer. When however the poison was\r\ncoagulated, they were not in the least affected by it--A tube\r\nimpregnated with the odour of poison recently ejected being presented\r\nto them, affected them in the same manner[271]. This circumstance may\r\nsometimes occasion battles amongst them, that are not otherwise easy\r\nto be accounted for.\r\n\r\nAnger is no useless or hurtful passion in bees: it is necessary to\r\nthem for the preservation of themselves and their property, which,\r\nbesides those of their own species, are exposed to the ravages of\r\nnumerous enemies. Of these I have already enumerated several of the\r\nclass of insects, and also some beasts and birds that have a taste\r\nfor bees and their produce[272]. The _Merops Apiaster_ (which has\r\nbeen taken in England), the lark and other birds catch them as they\r\nfly. Even the frog and the toad are said to kill great numbers of\r\nbees; and many that fall into the water probably become the prey of\r\nfish. The mouse also, especially the field-mouse, in winter often\r\ncommits great ravages in a hive, if the base and orifices are not\r\nwell secured and stopped[273]. Thorley once lost a stock by mice,\r\nwhich made a nest and produced young amongst the combs[274]. The\r\ntitmouse, according to the same author, will make a noise at the door\r\nof the hive, and when a bee comes out to see what is the matter, will\r\nseize and devour it. He has known them eat a dozen at a time. The\r\nswallows will assemble round the hives and devour them like grains of\r\ncorn[275]. I need only mention spiders, in whose webs they sometimes\r\nmeet with their end, and earwigs and ants, which creep into the hive\r\nand steal the honey[276].\r\n\r\nUpon this subject of the enemies of bees, I cannot persuade myself\r\nto omit the account Mr. White has given of an idiot-boy, who from a\r\nchild showed a strong propensity to bees. They were his food, his\r\namusement, his sole object. In the winter he dozed away his time\r\nin his father's house, by the fire-side, in a torpid state, seldom\r\nleaving the chimney-corner: but in summer he was all alert and in\r\nquest of his game. Hive-bees, humble-bees, and wasps were his prey\r\nwherever he found them. He had no apprehension from their stings, but\r\nwould seize them with naked hands, and at once disarm them of their\r\nweapons, and suck their bodies for the sake of their honey-bags.\r\nSometimes he would fill his bosom between his shirt and skin with\r\nthese animals; and sometimes he endeavoured to confine them in\r\nbottles. He was very injurious to men that kept bees; for he would\r\nglide into their bee-gardens, and sitting down before the stools,\r\nwould rap with his fingers, and so take the bees as they came out. He\r\nhas even been known to overturn the hives for the sake of the honey,\r\nof which he was passionately fond. Where metheglin was making, he\r\nwould linger round the tubs and vessels, begging a draught of what he\r\ncalled _bee-wine_. As he ran about, he used to make a humming noise\r\nwith his lips resembling the buzzing of bees. This lad was lean and\r\nsallow, and of a cadaverous complexion; and except in his favourite\r\npursuit, in which he was wonderfully adroit, discovered no manner of\r\nunderstanding. Had his capacity been better, and directed to the same\r\nobject, he had perhaps abated much of our wonder at the feats of a\r\nmore modern exhibiter of bees; and we may justly say of him now,\r\n\r\n                \"... Thou,\r\n          Had thy presiding star propitious shone,\r\n          Should'st Wildman be[277].\"\r\n\r\nThe worker bees are annual insects, though the queen will sometimes\r\nlive more than two years; but, as every swarm consists of old and\r\nyoung, this is no argument for burning them. It is a saying of\r\nbee-keepers in Holland, that the first swallow and the first bee\r\nforetell each other[278]. This perhaps may be correct there; but with\r\nus the appearance of bees considerably precedes that of the swallow;\r\nfor when the early crocuses open, if the weather be warm, they may\r\nalways be found busy in the blossom.\r\n\r\nThe time that bees will inhabit the same stations is wonderful.\r\nReaumur mentions a countryman who preserved bees in the same hive for\r\nthirty years[279]. Thorley tells us that a swarm took possession of a\r\nspot under the leads of the study of Ludovicus Vives in Oxford, where\r\nthey continued a hundred and ten years, from 1520 to 1630[280]. These\r\ncircumstances have led authors to ascribe to bees a greater age\r\nthan they can claim. Thus Mouffet, because he knew a bees-nest which\r\nhad remained thirty years in the same quarters, concludes that they\r\nare very long-lived, and very sapiently doubts whether they even die\r\nof old age at all[281]!!! Which is just as wise as if a man should\r\ncontend, because London had existed from before the time of Julius\r\nCæsar, that therefore its inhabitants must be immortal.\r\n\r\nBees are subject to many accidents, particularly, as I have said\r\nabove, they often fall or are precipitated by the wind into water;\r\nand though like the cat a bee has not nine lives, nor\r\n\r\n          \"Nine times emerging from the crystal flood,\r\n           She mews to every watery god,\"\r\n\r\nyet she will bear submersion nine hours; and, if exposed to\r\nsufficient heat, be reanimated. In this case their proboscis is\r\ngenerally unfolded, and stretched to its full length. At the\r\nextremity of this, motion is first perceived, and then at the ends of\r\nthe legs. After these symptoms appear they soon recover, fold up the\r\ntongue, and plume themselves for flight[282]. Experimentalists may\r\ntherefore, without danger, submerge a hive of bees, when they want to\r\nexamine them particularly, for they will all revive upon being set to\r\nthe fire. Reaumur says that in winter, during frosts, the bees remain\r\nin a torpid state. He must mean severe frosts; for Huber relates an\r\ninstance, when upon a sudden emergency, the bees of one of his hives\r\nset themselves to work in the middle of January; and he observes that\r\nthey are so little torpid in winter, that even when the thermometer\r\nabroad is below the freezing point, it stands high in populous\r\nhives. Swammerdam, and after him the two authors last quoted, found\r\nthat sometimes, even in the middle of winter, hives have young brood\r\nin them, which the bees feed and attend to[283]. In an instance of\r\nthis kind, which fell under the eye of Huber, the thermometer stood\r\nin the hive at about 92°. In colder climates, however, the bees\r\nwill probably be less active in the winter. They are then generally\r\nsituated between the combs towards their lower part. But when the\r\nair grows milder, especially if the rays of the sun fall upon the\r\nhive and warm it, they awake from their lethargy, shake their wings,\r\nand begin to move and recover their activity; with which their wants\r\nreturning, they then feed upon the stock of honey and bee-bread which\r\nthey have in reserve. The lowest cells are first uncovered, and their\r\ncontents consumed; the highest are reserved to the last. The honey\r\nin the lowest cells being collected in the autumn, probably will not\r\nkeep so well as the vernal.\r\n\r\nThe degree of heat in a hive in winter, as I have just hinted, is\r\ngreat. A thermometer near one, in the open air, that stood in January\r\nat 6-3/4° below the freezing point, upon the insertion of the bulb\r\na little way into the hive, rose to 22-1/2° above it; and could it\r\nhave been placed between the combs, where the bees themselves were\r\nagglomerated, the mercury, Reaumur conjectures, would have risen as\r\nhigh as it does abroad in the warm days in summer[284]. Huber says\r\nthat it stands in frost at 86° and 88° in populous hives[285]. In\r\nMay, the former author found, in a hive in which he had lodged a small\r\nswarm, that the thermometer indicated a degree of heat above that\r\nof the hottest days of summer[286]. He observes that their motion,\r\nand even the agitation of their wings, increases the heat of their\r\natmosphere. Often, when the squares of glass in a hive appeared cold\r\nto the touch, if either by design or chance he happened to disturb the\r\nbees, and the agglomerated mass in a tumult began to move different\r\nways, sending forth a great hum, in a very short time so considerable\r\nan accession of heat was produced, that when he touched the same\r\nsquares of glass, he felt them as hot as if they had been held near a\r\nfierce fire. By teasing the bees, the heat generated was sometimes so\r\ngreat as to soften very much the wax of the combs, and even to cause\r\nthem to fall[287]. This generation of heat in bee-hives seems to be\r\none of those mysteries of nature that has not yet been satisfactorily\r\naccounted for. Generally speaking, insects appear to have no animal\r\nheat; the temperature of their bodies being usually that of the\r\natmosphere in which they happen to be. But bees are an exception to\r\nthis rule, and produce heat in themselves. Whether they are the only\r\ninsect that can do this, as John Hunter affirms, or whether others that\r\nare gregarious, such as humble-bees, wasps, and ants, may not possess\r\nthe same faculty, seems not yet clearly ascertained. The heat in the\r\nhive in the above instance was evidently occasioned by the tumult into\r\nwhich the bees were put; and the hum, and motions that followed it,\r\nwere probably the result of their anger. But how these act physically,\r\nin an animal that has no circulation, I am unable to say; and must\r\nleave the question, like my predecessors, undecided.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now having detailed to you thus amply the wonderful history\r\nand proceedings of the social tribes of the insect world, you will\r\nallow, I think, that I have redeemed my pledge, when I taught you\r\nto expect that this history would exceed in interest and variety\r\nand marvellous results every thing that I had before related to\r\nyou. I trust, moreover, that you will scarcely feel disposed to\r\nsubscribe to that opinion, though it has the sanction of some great\r\nnames, which attributes these almost miraculous instincts to mere\r\nsensation; which tells us, that the sensorium of these insects is\r\nso modelled with respect to the different operations that are given\r\nthem in charge, that it is by the attraction of pleasure alone that\r\nthey are determined to the execution of them; and that, as every\r\ncircumstance relative to the succession of their different labours\r\nis pre-ordained, to each of them an agreeable sensation is affixed\r\nby the Creator: and that thus, when the bees build their cells;\r\nwhen they sedulously attend to the young brood, when they collect\r\nprovisions; this is the result of no plans, of no affection, of no\r\nforesight; but that the sole determining motive is the enjoyment of\r\nan agreeable sensation attached to each of these operations[288].\r\nSurely it would be better to resolve all their proceedings at once\r\ninto a direct impulse from the Creator, than to maintain a theory so\r\ncontrary to fact; and which militates against the whole history which\r\nM. Huber, who adopts this theory from Bonnet, has so ably given of\r\nthese creatures. That they may experience agreeable sensations from\r\ntheir various employments, nobody will deny; but that such sensations\r\ninstruct them how to perform their several operations, without any\r\nplan previously impressed upon their sensorium, is contrary both to\r\nreason and experience. They have a plan, it is evident; and that\r\nplan, which proves that it is not mere sensation, they vary according\r\nto circumstances. As to affection--that bees are irritable, and\r\nfeel the passion of anger, no one will deny; that they are also\r\nsusceptible of fear, is equally evident: and if they feel anger\r\nand fear, why may they not also feel _love_? Further, if they have\r\nrecourse to precautions for the prevention of any evil that seems to\r\nthreaten them, how can we refuse them a degree of _foresight_? Must\r\nwe also resolve all their patriotism, and the singular regard for\r\nthe welfare of their community, which seems constantly to actuate\r\nthem, and the sacrifices, even sometimes of themselves, that they\r\nmake to promote and ensure it, into individual self-love? We would\r\nnot set them up as rivals to man in intelligence, foresight, and the\r\naffections; but they have that degree of each that is necessary for\r\ntheir purposes. On account of the difficulties attending all theories\r\nthat give them some degree of these qualities, to resolve all into\r\nmere sensation, is removing one difficulty by a greater.\r\n\r\nThat these creatures from mere selfishness build their combs,\r\nreplenish them with the fruit of their unwearied labours, attend\r\nso assiduously to the nurture of the young brood, lavish their\r\ncaresses upon their queen, prevent all her wants, give a portion of\r\nthe honey they have collected to those that remain in the hives,\r\nassist each other, defend their common dwelling, and are ready to\r\nsacrifice themselves for the public good--is an anomaly _in rerum\r\nnatura_ that ought never to be admitted, unless established by\r\nthe most irrefragable demonstration;--and I think you will not be\r\ndisposed without full proof to yield yourself to a mere theory, so\r\ncontradictory of all the facts we know relative to this subject.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there are mysteries, as to the _primum mobile_, amongst\r\nthese social tribes, that with all our boasted reason we cannot\r\nfathom; nor develop satisfactorily the motives that urge them to\r\nfulfill in so remarkable though diversified a way their different\r\ndestinies. One thing is clear to demonstration, that by these\r\ncreatures and their instincts, the power, wisdom and goodness of\r\nthe GREAT FATHER of the universe are loudly proclaimed; the atheist\r\nand infidel confuted; the believer confirmed in his faith and trust\r\nin Providence, which he thus beholds watching, with incessant care,\r\nover the welfare of the meanest of his creatures; and from which\r\nhe may conclude that he, the prince of the creation, will never be\r\noverlooked or forsaken: and from them what lessons may be learned\r\nof patriotism and self-devotion to the public good; of loyalty; of\r\nprudence, temperance, diligence, and self-denial.--But it is time at\r\nlength to put an end to this long disquisition.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[199] Bonnet, x. 259.\r\n\r\n[200] _Bibl.

A hive of bees belonging to a\r\nprofessional gentleman of this city, swarmed on Thursday last, after\r\nwhich they were hived in the regular way, and appeared to be doing\r\nwell. On the Saturday after, a swarm of bees, from some neighbouring\r\nhive, appeared to be flying over the garden in which the hive\r\nabove-mentioned was placed, when they instantly darted down upon the\r\nhive of the new settlers, and completely covered it: in a little time\r\nthey began to enter the hive, and poured into it in such numbers that\r\nit soon became completely filled. A loud humming noise was heard, and\r\nthe work of destruction immediately ensued; the winged combatants\r\nsallied forth from the hive, until it became entirely empty; and a\r\nfurious battle commenced in \"upper air,\" between the besiegers and\r\nthe besieged. A spectator informs us, that these intrepid little\r\nwarriors were so numerous, that they literally darkened the sky\r\noverhead like a cloud; meanwhile the destructive battle raged with\r\nfury on both sides, and the ground beneath was covered with the\r\nwounded and the slain, hundreds of them were lying dead, or crawling\r\nabout, disabled from re-ascending to the scene of action. To one\r\nparty, however, the palm of victory was at last awarded, and they\r\nsettled upon the branch of an adjoining apple-tree, from which they\r\nwere safely placed in the empty hive, which had been the object of\r\ntheir valiant contention, and where they now continue peacefully and\r\nindustriously employed in adding to the stores of their commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[269] Comp.

The insect tribes constitute such a nation:\r\nwith them infinite hosts of enemies wage continual war, many of whom\r\nderive the whole of their subsistence from them: and amongst their\r\nown tribes there are numerous civil broils, the strong often preying\r\nupon the weak, and the cunning upon the simple: so that unless a\r\nwatchful Providence (which cares for all its creatures, even the\r\nmost insignificant,) had supplied them with some mode of resistance\r\nor escape, this innumerable race must soon be extirpated. That such\r\nis the case, it shall be my endeavour in this letter to prove; in\r\nwhich I shall detail to you some of the most remarkable means of\r\ndefence with which they are provided. For the sake of distinctness\r\nI shall consider these under two separate heads, into which indeed\r\nthey naturally divide themselves:--_Passive_ means of defence, such\r\nas are independent of any efforts of the insect; and _active_ means\r\nof defence, such as result from certain efforts of the insect in the\r\nemployment of those instincts and instruments with which Providence\r\nhas furnished it for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The principal _passive_ means of defence with which insects are\r\nprovided, are derived from their colour and form, by which they\r\neither deceive, dazzle, alarm, or annoy their enemies; or from their\r\nsubstance, involuntary secretions, vitality, and numbers.\r\n\r\nThey often _deceive_ them by imitating various substances. Sometimes\r\nthey so exactly resemble the soil which they inhabit, that it must be\r\na practised eye which can distinguish them from it. Thus, one of our\r\nscarcest British weevils (_Curculio nebulosus_), by its gray colour\r\nspotted with black, so closely imitates the soil consisting of white\r\nsand mixed with black earth, on which I have always found it, that\r\nits chance of escape, even though it be hunted for by the lyncean eye\r\nof an entomologist, is not small. Another insect of the same tribe\r\n(_Thylacites scabriculus_), of which I have observed several species\r\nof ground-beetles, (_Harpalus_, &c.) make great havoc, abounds in\r\npits of a loamy soil of the same colour precisely with itself; a\r\ncircumstance that doubtless occasions many to escape from their\r\npitiless foes.--Several other weevils, for instance _Chlorima nivea_\r\nand _cretacea_, resemble chalk, and perhaps inhabit a chalky or white\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nMany insects also are like pebbles and stones, both rough and\r\npolished, and of various colours; but since this resemblance\r\nsometimes results from their attitudes, I shall enlarge upon it under\r\nmy second head: whether, however, it be merely passive, or combined\r\nwith action, we may safely regard it as given to enable them to elude\r\nthe vigilance of their enemies.\r\n\r\nA numerous host of our little animals escape from birds and other\r\nassailants by imitating the colour of the plants, or parts of them,\r\nwhich they inhabit; or the twigs of shrubs and trees; their foliage,\r\nflowers, and fruit. Many of the mottled moths, which take their\r\nstation of diurnal repose on the north side of the trunks of trees,\r\nare with difficulty distinguished from the gray and green lichens\r\nthat cover them. Of this kind are _Miselia aprilina_ and _Acronycta\r\nPsi_. The caterpillar of _Pœcilia? Algæ_, when it feeds on the\r\nyellow _Lichen juniperinus_, is always yellow; but when upon the\r\ngray _Lichen saxatilis_ its hue becomes gray[289]. This change is\r\nprobably produced by the colour of its food. _Leptocerus atratus_,\r\na kind of may-fly, frequents the black flower-spikes of the common\r\nsedge (_Carex riparia_), which fringes the banks of our rivers. I\r\nhave often been unable to distinguish it from them, and the birds\r\nprobably often make the same mistake and pass it by.--A jumping bug,\r\nvery similar to one figured by Schellenberg[290], also much resembles\r\nthe lichens of the oak on which I took it.\r\n\r\nThe Spectre tribe (_Phasma_) go still further in this mimicry,\r\nrepresenting a small branch with its spray. I have one from Brazil\r\neight inches long, that, unless it was seen to move, could scarcely\r\nbe conceived to be any thing else; the legs as well as the head,\r\nhaving their little snags and knobs, so that no imitation can be more\r\naccurate. Perhaps this may be the species mentioned by Molina[291],\r\nwhich the natives of Chili call \"The Devil's Horse[292].\"\r\n\r\nOther insects, of various tribes, represent the leaves of plants,\r\nliving, decaying, and dead; some in their colour, and some both in\r\ntheir colour and shape. The caterpillar of a moth (_Hadena Ligustri_)\r\nthat feeds upon the privet, is so exactly of the colour of the\r\nunderside of the leaf, upon which it usually sits in the day-time,\r\nthat you may have the leaf in your hand and yet not discover\r\nit[293].--The tribe of grasshoppers, called _Locustæ_ by Fabricius,\r\nthough the true _Locust_ does not belong to it, in the veining,\r\ncolour, and texture of their elytra, resemble green leaves[294].--The\r\ntribe of _Phasmina_--named praying-insects and spectres--also of\r\nthe _Orthoptera_ order, often exhibit the same peculiarity.--Others\r\nof them, by the spots and mixtures of colour observable in these\r\norgans, represent leaves that are decaying in various degrees.--Those\r\nof several species of _Mantidæ_ likewise imitate dry leaves, and so\r\nexactly, by their opacity, colour, rigidity, and veins, that, were\r\nno other part of the animal visible, even after a close examination,\r\nit would be generally affirmed to be nothing but a dry leaf. Of this\r\nnature is the _Phyllium siccifolium_, and two or three Brazilian\r\nspecies in my cabinet, that seem undescribed, which I will show\r\nyou when you give me an opportunity. But these imitations of dry\r\nleaves are not confined to the _Orthoptera_ order solely. Amongst\r\nthe _Hemiptera_, the _Acanthia paradoxa_, a kind of bug, surprised\r\nSparrman not a little. He was sheltering himself from the mid-day\r\nsun, when the air was so still and calm as scarcely to shake an aspen\r\nleaf, and saw with wonder what he mistook for a little withered,\r\npale, crumpled leaf, eaten as it were by caterpillars, fluttering\r\nfrom the tree. The sight appeared to him so very extraordinary, that\r\nhe left his place of shelter to contemplate it more nearly; and could\r\nscarcely believe his eyes, when he beheld a living insect, in shape\r\nand colour resembling a fragment of a withered leaf with the edges\r\nturned up and eaten away as it were by caterpillars, and at the same\r\ntime all over beset with prickles[295].--A British insect, one of\r\nour largest moths (_Gastropacha quercifolia_), called by collectors\r\nthe _Lappet-moth_, affords an example from the _Lepidoptera_ order\r\nof the imitation in question, its wings representing, both in shape\r\nand colour, an arid brown leaf. Some bugs, belonging to the genus\r\n_Dictyonota_ of Mr. Curtis[296], simulate portions of leaves in a\r\nstill further state of decay, when the veins only are left. For, the\r\nthorax and elytra of these insects being reticulated, with the little\r\nareas or meshes of the net-work transparent, this circumstance gives\r\nthem exactly the appearance of small fragments of skeletons of leaves.\r\n\r\nBut you have probably heard of most of these species of imitation: I\r\nhope, therefore, you will give credit to the two instances to which\r\nI shall next call your attention, of insects that even mimic flowers\r\nand fruit. With respect to the former, I recollect to have seen in\r\na collection made by Mr. Masson at the Cape of Good Hope, a species\r\nof the orthopterous genus _Pneumora_, the elytra of which were of a\r\nrose- or pink-colour, which shrowding its vesiculose abdomen, gave it\r\nmuch the appearance of a fine flower--A most beautiful and brilliant\r\nbeetle, of the genus _Chlamys_, (_Ch. Bacca_,) found by Captain\r\nHancock in Brazil, by the inequalities of its ruby-coloured surface,\r\nstrikingly resembles some kinds of fruit.--And to make the series\r\nof imitations complete, a minute black beetle, with ridges upon its\r\nelytra, (_Onthophilus sulcatus_[297],) when lying without motion, is\r\nvery like the seed of an umbelliferous plant. The dog-tick is not\r\nunlike a small bean; which resemblance has caused a bean, commonly\r\ncultivated as food for horses, to be called the _tick-bean_. The\r\nPalma Christi, also, had probably the name of _Ricinus_ given to it\r\nfrom the similitude of its seed to a tick.\r\n\r\nAnother tribe of these little animals, before alluded to, is secured\r\nfrom harm by a different kind of imitation, and affords a beautiful\r\ninstance of the wisdom of Providence in adapting means to their end.\r\nSome singular larvæ, with a radiated anus[298], live in the nests of\r\nhumble-bees, and are the offspring of a particular genus of flies,\r\n(_Volucella_,) many of the species of which strikingly resemble\r\nthose bees in shape, clothing, and colour. Thus has the Author of\r\nnature provided that they may enter these nests and deposit their\r\neggs undiscovered. Did these intruders venture themselves amongst\r\nthe humble-bees in a less kindred form, their lives would probably\r\npay the forfeit of their presumption. Mr. Sheppard once found one of\r\nthese larvæ in the nest of _Bombus_[299] _Raiellus_, but we could not\r\nascertain what the fly was. Perhaps it might be _Volucella bombylans_,\r\nwhich resembles those humble-bees that have a red anus[300].\r\n\r\nThe brilliant colours in which many insects are arrayed, may decorate\r\nthem with some other view than that of mere ornament. They may _dazzle_\r\ntheir enemies. The radiant blue of the upper surface of the wings of\r\na giant butterfly, abundant in Brazil (_Morpho Menelaus_), which from\r\nits size would be a ready prey for any insectivorous birds, by its\r\nsplendour (which I am told, when the insect is flying in the sunshine,\r\nis inconceivably bright,) may produce an effect upon the sight of such\r\nbirds, that may give it no small chance of escape. Latreille has a\r\nsimilar conjecture with respect to the golden wasps (_Chrysis_, L.).\r\nThese animals lay their eggs in the nests of such _Hymenoptera_, wasps,\r\nbee-wasps (_Bembex_), and bees,--as are redoubtable for their stings;\r\nand therefore have the utmost occasion for protection against these\r\nmurderous weapons. Amongst other defences the golden wasps are adorned\r\nwith the most brilliant colours, which by their radiance, especially\r\nin the sunny situations frequented by these insects, may dazzle the\r\neyes of their enemies, and enable them to effect unhurt the purpose for\r\nwhich they were created[301].\r\n\r\nThe frightful aspect of certain insects is another passive mean\r\nof defence by which they sometimes strike beholders, especially\r\nchildren, often great insect tormentors, with _alarm_, and so\r\nescape. The terrific and protended jaws of the stag-beetle (_Lucanus\r\nCervus_) in Europe, and of the stag-horn capricorn beetle (_Prionus\r\ncervicornis_) in America, may save them from the cruel fate of the\r\npoor cockchafer[302], whose gyrations and motions, when transfixed\r\nby a pin, too often form the amusement of ill-disciplined children.\r\nThe threatening horns also, prominent eyes, or black and dismal hue\r\nof many other _Coleoptera_ belonging to Linné's genera _Scarabæus_,\r\n_Cicindela_, and _Carabus_, may produce the same effect.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking instances of armour are to be found amongst the\r\nhomopterous _Hemiptera_. In some of these, the horns that rise from\r\nthe thorax are so singular and monstrous, that nothing parallel to\r\nthem can be found in nature. Of this kind is the _Cicada spinosa_,\r\nStoll[303], the _Centrotus clavatus_[304], and more particularly the\r\n_Centrotus globularis_[305], so remarkable for the extraordinary\r\napparatus of balls and spines, which it appears to carry erect,\r\nlike a standard, over its head. What is the precise use of all the\r\nvarieties of armour with which these little creatures are furnished\r\nit is not easy to say, but they may probably defend them from the\r\nattack of some enemies.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I may mention the long hairs, stiff bristles, sharp\r\nspines, and hard tubercular prominences with which many caterpillars\r\nare clothed, bristled, and studded. That these are means of defence\r\nis rendered more probable by the fact that, in several instances,\r\nthe animals so distinguished, at their last moult, previous to their\r\nassuming the pupa, (in which state they are protected by other\r\ncontrivances,) appear with a smooth skin, without any of the tubercles,\r\nhairs, or spines for which they were before remarkable[306]. Wonderful\r\nare the varieties of this kind which insects exhibit:--but upon these\r\nI shall treat more at large on a future occasion. I shall only here\r\nselect a few facts more particularly connected with my present subject.\r\nThe caterpillar of the great tiger-moth (_Euprepia Caja_), which is\r\nbeset with long dense hairs, when rolled up--an attitude it usually\r\nassumes if alarmed--cannot then be taken without great difficulty,\r\nslipping repeatedly from the pressure of the fingers. If its hairs do\r\nnot render it distasteful, this may often be the mean of its escape\r\nfrom the birds.--That little destructive beetle, _Anthrenus Musorum_,\r\nwhich so annoys the entomologist, if it gets into his cabinets, when\r\nin the larva state being covered with bunches of diverging hairs,\r\nglides from between your fingers as if it were lubricated with oil.\r\nThe two tufts of hairs near the tail of this are most curious in their\r\nstructure, being jointed through their whole length, and terminating\r\nin a sharp halberd-shaped point[307].--I have a small lepidopterous\r\ncaterpillar from Brazil, the upper side of which is thickly beset with\r\nstrong, sharp, branching spines, which would enter into the finger, and\r\nwould probably render it a painful morsel to any minor enemy.\r\n\r\nThe powers of _annoyance_, by means of their hairs, with which the\r\nmoth of the fir, and the procession-moth, before noticed[308], are\r\ngifted, are doubtless a defensive armour to them.--Madame Merian has\r\nfigured an enormous caterpillar of this kind,--which unfortunately\r\nshe could not trace to the perfect insect,--by the very touch of\r\nwhich her hands, she says, were inflamed, and that the inflammation\r\nwas succeeded by the most excruciating pain[309]. The vesicatory\r\nbeetles, likewise, (_Cantharis vesicatoria_, &c.) are not improbably\r\ndefended from their assailants by the remarkable quality, so useful\r\nto suffering mortals, that distinguishes them.\r\n\r\nYour own observation must have proved to you, that insects often\r\nescape great perils, from the crush of the foot, or of superincumbent\r\nweights, by the hardness of the _substance_ that covers great numbers\r\nof them. The elytra of many beetles of the genus _Hister_ are so\r\nnearly impenetrable, that it is very difficult to make a pin pass\r\nthrough them; and the smaller stag-beetle (_Dorcus parallelopipedus_)\r\nwill bear almost any weight--the head and trunk forming a slight\r\nangle with the abdomen--which passes over it upon the ground. Other\r\ninsects are protected by the toughness of their skin. A remarkable\r\ninstance of this is afforded by the common forest-fly (_Hippobosca\r\nequina_), which, as was before observed[310], can scarcely be killed\r\nby the utmost pressure of the finger and thumb.\r\n\r\nThe _involuntary secretions_ of these little beings may also be\r\nregarded as means of defence, which either conceal them from their\r\nenemies, make them more difficult to be attacked, or render them less\r\npalatable. Thus, the white froth often observable upon rose-bushes,\r\nand other shrubs and plants, called by the vulgar frog-spittle,--but\r\nwhich, if examined, will be found to envelop the larva of a small\r\nhemipterous insect (_Cercopis spumaria_), from whose anus it exudes,\r\nalthough it is sometimes discovered even in this concealment by the\r\nindefatigable wasps, and becomes their prey,--serves to protect the\r\ninsect, which soon dies when exposed, not only from the heat of the\r\nsun and from violent rains, but also to hide it from the birds and\r\nits other foes.--The cottony secretion that transpires through the\r\nskin of _Myzoxyla_[311], and some species of _Coccus_, and in which\r\nthe eggs of the latter are often involved, may perhaps be of use to\r\nthem in this view; either concealing them--for they look rather like\r\nlittle locks of cotton, or feathers, than any thing animated--or\r\nrendering them distasteful to creatures that would otherwise prey\r\nupon them.--The same remark may apply to the slimy caterpillars of\r\nsome of the saw-flies (_Tenthredo Cerasi_, _Allantus Scrophulariæ_\r\n&c.) The coat of slime of these animals, as Professor Peck\r\nobserves[312], retains its humidity though exposed to the fiercest\r\nsun.--Under this head I shall also mention the phosphoric insects:\r\nthe glow-worm (_Lampyris_); the lantern-fly (_Fulgora_); the fire-fly\r\n(_Elater_); and the electric centipede (_Geophilus electricus_);\r\nsince the light emitted by these animals may defend them from the\r\nattack of some enemies. Mr. Sheppard once noticed a Carabus running\r\nround the last-mentioned insect, when shining, as if wishing but\r\nafraid to attack it.\r\n\r\nVarious insects, doubtless, find the wonderful _vitality_[313] with\r\nwhich they are endowed another mean of defence; at least of obviating\r\nthe effects of an attack. So that, when to all appearance they are\r\nmortally wounded, they recover, and fulfil the end of their creation.\r\nIndeed female _Lepidoptera_, especially of the larger kinds, will\r\nscarcely die, do what you will, till they have laid their eggs.--Dr.\r\nArnold, a most acute observer, relates to Mr. MacLeay, that having\r\npinned _Scolia quadrimaculata_, a hymenopterous insect, down in\r\nthe same box with many others, amongst which was the humming-bird\r\nhawk-moth (_Macroglossa stellatarum_), its proper food; it freed\r\nitself from the pin that transfixed it, and, neglecting all the other\r\ninsects in the box, attacked the Sphinx, and pulling it to pieces\r\ndevoured a large portion of its abdomen.\r\n\r\nWe often wonder how the cheese-mite (_Acarus Siro_) is at hand to\r\nattack a cheese wherever deposited; but when we learn from Leeuwenhoek,\r\nthat one lived eleven weeks gummed on its back to the point of a needle\r\nwithout food, our wonder will be diminished[314]. Another species\r\nof mite (_Uropoda vegetans_) was observed by De Geer to live some\r\ntime in spirits of wine[315]. This last circumstance reminds me of an\r\nevent which befel myself, that I cannot refrain from relating to you,\r\nsince it was the cause of my taking up the pursuit I am recommending\r\nto you. One morning I observed on my study window a little lady-bird\r\nyellow with black dots (_Coccinella_ 22-_punctata_)--\"You are very\r\npretty,\" said I to myself, \"and I should like to have a collection\r\nof such creatures.\" Immediately I seized my prey, and not knowing\r\nhow to destroy it, I immersed it in geneva. After leaving it in this\r\nsituation a day and a night, and seeing it without motion, I concluded\r\nit was dead, and laid it in the sun to dry. It no sooner, however, felt\r\nthe warmth than it began to move, and afterward flew away. From this\r\ntime I began to attend to insects.--The chamæleon-fly (_Stratyomis\r\nChamæleon_) was observed by Swammerdam to retain its vital powers\r\nafter an immersion equally long in spirits of wine. Gœdart affirms\r\nthat this fly, on which account it was called chamæleon, will live\r\nnine months without food; a circumstance, if true, more wonderful than\r\nwhat I formerly related to you with respect to one of the aphidivorous\r\nflies[316].--If insects will escape unhurt from a bath of alcohol, it\r\nmay be supposed that one of water will be less to be dreaded by them.\r\nTo this they are often exposed in rainy weather, when ruts and hollows\r\nare filled with water: but when the water is dried up, it is seldom\r\nthat any dead carcases of insects are to be seen in them. Mr. Curtis\r\nsubmerged the fragile aphides for sixteen hours; when taken out of the\r\nwater they immediately showed signs of life, and out of four, three\r\nsurvived the experiment:--an immersion of twenty-four hours, however,\r\nproved fatal to them[317].\r\n\r\nThe late ingenious, learned, and lamented Dr. Reeve of Norwich\r\nonce related to me that he found in a hot fountain on the top of\r\na mountain, near Leuk in the Valais in Switzerland, in which the\r\nthermometer stood at 205°, transparent larvæ, probably of gnats, or\r\nsome such insect.--Lord Bute also, in a letter to my late revered\r\nfriend, the Rev. William Jones of Nayland, imparts a similar\r\nobservation made by His Lordship at the baths of Abano, near the\r\nEuganian mountains, on the borders of the Paduan states. They are\r\nstrong, sulphureous, boiling springs, oozing out of a rocky eminence\r\nin great numbers, and spreading over an acre of the top of a gentle\r\nhill. In the midst of these boiling springs, within three feet\r\nof five or six of them, rises a tepid one about blood warm. But\r\nthe most extraordinary circumstance which he relates is, that not\r\nonly confervas were found in the _boiling_ springs, but numbers of\r\nsmall black beetles, that died upon being taken out and plunged\r\ninto cold water[318].--And once, having taken in the hot dung of my\r\ncucumber-bed a small beetle (_Synchita Juglandis_), I immersed it\r\nin boiling water; and after keeping it submerged a sufficient time,\r\nas I thought, to destroy it, upon taking it out, and laying it to\r\ndry, it soon began to move and walk. Its native station being of\r\nso high a temperature, Providence has fitted it for it, by giving\r\nit extraordinary powers of sustaining heat. Other insects are as\r\nremarkable for bearing any degree of cold. Some gnats that De Geer\r\nobserved, survived after the water in which they were was frozen into\r\na mass of ice: and Reaumur relates many similar instances[319].\r\n\r\nThe last passive means of defence that I mentioned, was the\r\n_multiplication_ of insects. Some species, the Aphides for instance,\r\nand the Grasshoppers and Locusts, have such an infinite host of\r\nenemies, that were it not for their numbers the race would soon\r\nbe annihilated.--But as passive means of defence have detained us\r\nsufficiently long, it is enough to have touched upon this head. Let\r\nus then now proceed to such as may be called active; in which the\r\nvolition of the animal bears some part.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The _active_ means of defence, which tend to secure insects from\r\ninjury or attack, are much more numerous and diversified than the\r\npassive; and also more interesting, since they depend, more or less,\r\nupon the efforts and industry of these creatures themselves. When\r\nurged by danger, they endeavour to repel it either by having recourse\r\nto certain attitudes or motions; producing particular noises;\r\nemitting disagreeable scents or fluids; employing their limbs; or\r\nweapons, and valour; concealing themselves in various ways; or by\r\ncounteracting the designs and attack of their enemies by contrivances\r\nthat require ingenuity and skill.\r\n\r\nThe _attitudes_ which insects assume for this purpose are various.\r\nSome are purely imitative, as in many instances detailed above. I\r\npossess a diminutive rove-beetle (_Aleochara complicans_, K. Ms.) to\r\nwhich my attention was attracted as a very minute, shining, round,\r\nblack pebble. This successful imitation was produced by folding its\r\nhead under its breast, and turning up its abdomen over its elytra;\r\nso that the most piercing and discriminating eye would never have\r\ndiscovered it to be an insect.--I have observed that a carrion beetle\r\n(_Silpha thoracica_) when alarmed has recourse to a similar manœuvre.\r\nIts orange-coloured thorax, the rest of the body being black,\r\nrenders it particularly conspicuous. To obviate this inconvenience,\r\nit turns its head and tail inwards till they are parallel with the\r\ntrunk and abdomen, and gives its thorax a vertical direction, when\r\nit resembles a rough stone.--The species of another genus of beetles\r\n(_Agathidium_) will also bend both head and thorax under the elytra,\r\nand so assume the appearance of shining globular pebbles.\r\n\r\nRelated to the defensive attitude of the two last-mentioned insects,\r\nand precisely the same with that of the Armadillo (_Dasypus_) amongst\r\nquadrupeds, is that of one of the species of woodlouse (_Armadillo\r\nvulgaris_). This insect when alarmed rolls itself up into a little\r\nball. In this attitude its legs and the underside of the body, which\r\nare soft, are entirely covered and defended by the hard crust that\r\nforms the upper surface of the animal. These balls are perfectly\r\nspherical, black, and shining, and belted with narrow white bands, so\r\nas to resemble beautiful beads; and could they be preserved in this\r\nform and strung, would make very ornamental necklaces and bracelets.\r\nAt least so thought Swammerdam's maid, who, finding a number of these\r\ninsects thus rolled up in her master's garden, mistaking them for\r\nbeads, employed herself in stringing them on a thread; when to her\r\ngreat surprise, the poor animals beginning to move and struggle for\r\ntheir liberty, crying out and running away in the utmost alarm she\r\nthrew down her prize[320].--The golden-wasp tribe also, (_Chrysis_\r\nand _Parnopes_,) all of which I suspect to be parasitic insects, roll\r\nthemselves up, as I have often observed, into a little ball when\r\nalarmed, and can thus secure themselves--the upper surface of the\r\nbody being remarkably hard, and impenetrable to their weapons--from\r\nthe stings of those _Hymenoptera_ whose nests they enter with the\r\nview of depositing their eggs in their offspring. Latreille noticed\r\nthis attitude in _Parnopes carnea_, which, he tells us, _Bembex\r\nrostrata_ pursues, though it attacks no other similar insect, with\r\ngreat fury; and, seizing it with its feet, attempts to dispatch it\r\nwith its sting, from which it thus secures itself[321].\r\n\r\nOther insects endeavour to protect themselves from danger by\r\nsimulating death. The common dung-chafer (_Geotrupes stercorarius_)\r\nwhen touched, or in fear, sets out its legs as stiff as if they were\r\nmade of iron-wire--which is their posture when dead--and remaining\r\nperfectly motionless, thus deceives the rooks which prey upon them,\r\nand like the ant-lion before celebrated[322] will eat them only when\r\nalive. A different attitude is assumed by one of the tree-chafers\r\n(_Hoplia pulverulenta_) probably with the same view. It sometimes\r\nelevates its posterior legs into the air, so as to form a straight\r\nvertical line, at right angles with the upper surface of its\r\nbody.--Another genus of insects of the same order, the pill-beetles\r\n(_Byrrhus_), have recourse to a method the reverse of this. They\r\npack their legs, which are short and flat, so close to their body,\r\nand lie so entirely without motion when alarmed, that they look like\r\na dead body, or rather the dung of some small animal.--Amongst the\r\nweevil tribe, most of the species of Germar's genus _Cryptorynchus_,\r\nincluding several modern genera or subgenera, when an entomological\r\nfinger approaches them, as I have often experienced to my great\r\ndisappointment, applying their rostrum and legs to the underside of\r\ntheir trunk, fall from the station on which you hope to entrap them,\r\nto the ground or amongst the grass; where, lying without stirring\r\na limb, they are scarcely to be distinguished from the soil around\r\nthem. Thus also, doubtless, they often disappoint the birds as\r\nwell as the entomologist.--A little timber-boring beetle (_Anobium\r\npertinax_), (and others of the genus have the same faculty,)\r\nwhich, when the head is withdrawn somewhat within the thorax, much\r\nresembles a monk with his hood, has long been famous for a most\r\npertinacious simulation of death. All that has been related of the\r\nheroic constancy of American savages, when taken and tortured by\r\ntheir enemies, scarcely comes up to that which these little creatures\r\nexhibit. You may maim them, pull them limb from limb, roast them\r\nalive over a slow-fire[323], but you will not gain your end; not a\r\njoint will they move, nor show by the least symptom that they suffer\r\npain. Do not think, however, that I ever tried these experiments upon\r\nthem myself, or that I recommend you to do the same. I am content\r\nto believe the facts that I have here stated upon the concurrent\r\ntestimony of respectable witnesses, without feeling any temptation\r\nto put the constancy of the poor insect again to the test.--A similar\r\napathy is shown by some species of saw-flies (_Serrifera_), which\r\nwhen alarmed conceal their antennæ under their body, place their\r\nlegs close to it, and remain without motion even when transfixed\r\nby a pin.--Spiders also simulate death by folding up their legs,\r\nfalling from their station, and remaining motionless; and when in\r\nthis situation, they may be pierced and torn to pieces without their\r\nexhibiting the slightest symptom of pain[324].\r\n\r\nThere is a certain tribe of caterpillars called surveyors (_Geometræ_),\r\nthat will sometimes support themselves for whole hours, by means of\r\ntheir posterior legs, solely upon their anal extremity, forming an\r\nangle of various degrees with the branch on which they are standing,\r\nand looking like one of its twigs. Many concurring circumstances\r\npromote this deception. The body is kept stiff and immoveable with\r\nthe separations of the segments scarcely visible; it terminates in a\r\nknob, the legs being applied close, so as to resemble the gem at the\r\nend of a twig; besides which, it often exhibits intermediate tubercles\r\nwhich increase the resemblance. Its colour too is usually obscure,\r\nand similar to that of the bark of a tree. So that, doubtless, the\r\nsparrows and other birds are frequently deceived by this manœuvre, and\r\nthus balked of their prey. Rösel's gardener, mistaking one of these\r\ncaterpillars for a dead twig, started back in great alarm when upon\r\nattempting to break it off he found it was a living animal[325].\r\n\r\nBut insects do not always confine themselves to attitudes by which\r\nthey meditate escape or concealment; they sometimes, to show their\r\ncourage, put themselves in a posture of defence, and even have in\r\nview the annoyance as well as the repelling of their foes. The\r\ngreat rove-beetle (_Goerius olens_) presents an object sufficiently\r\nterrific, when with its large jaws expanded, and its abdomen turned\r\nover its head, like a scorpion, it menaces its enemies, some of which\r\nthis ferocious attitude may deter from attacking it. Mr. Bingley\r\ninforms us that the giant earwig (_Labidura gigantea_), a rare\r\nspecies that his researches have added to the catalogue of British\r\ninsects, turns up over its head, in a similar manner, its abdomen,\r\nwhich being armed at the end with a large forceps must give it an\r\nappearance still more alarming[326].\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of some hawk-moths (_Sphinx_), particularly that which\r\nfeeds upon the privet, when they repose, holding strongly with their\r\nprolegs the branch on which they are standing, rear the anterior part\r\nof their body so as to form nearly a right angle with the posterior;\r\nand in this position it will remain perfectly tranquil,--thus eluding\r\nthe notice of its enemies, or alarming them,--perhaps for hours.\r\nReaumur relates that a gardener in the employment of the celebrated\r\nJussieu used to be quite disconcerted by the self-sufficient air\r\nof these animals, saying they must be very proud, for he had never\r\nseen any other caterpillars hold their head so high[327]. From this\r\nattitude, which precisely resembles that which sculptors have assigned\r\nto the fabulous monster called by that name, the term _Sphinx_ has been\r\nused to designate this genus of insects.--The caterpillar of a moth\r\n(_Lophopteryx camelina_) noticed by the author just quoted, whenever\r\nit rests from feeding, turns its head over its back, then become\r\nconcave, at the same time elevating its tail, the extremity of which\r\nremains in a horizontal position, with two short horns like ears behind\r\nit. Thus the six anterior legs are in the air, and the whole animal\r\nlooks like a quadruped in miniature; the tail being its head--the horns\r\nits ears--and the reflexed head simulating a tail curled over its\r\nback[328]. In this seemingly unnatural attitude it will remain without\r\nmotion for a very long time.\r\n\r\nSome lepidopterous larvæ, that fix the one half of the body and\r\nelevate the other, agitate the elevated part, whether it be the head\r\nor the tail, as if to strike what disturbs them[329]. The giant\r\ncaterpillar of a large North American moth (_Ceracampa regalis_) is\r\narmed behind the head and at the back of the anterior segments with\r\nseven or eight strong curved spines from half to three-fourths of an\r\ninch in length. Mr. Abbot tells us that this caterpillar is called\r\nin Virginia the hickory-horned devil, and that when disturbed it\r\ndraws up its head, shaking or striking it from side to side; which\r\nattitude gives it so formidable an aspect, that no one, he affirms,\r\nwill venture to handle it, people in general dreading it as much as\r\na rattle-snake. When, to convince the Negroes that it was harmless,\r\nhe himself took hold of this animal in their presence, they used\r\nto reply that it could not sting him, but would them[330]. The\r\nspecies of a genus of beetles named _Malachius_, endeavour to alarm\r\ntheir enemies and show their rage by puffing out and inflating four\r\nvesicles from the sides of their body, which are of a bright red,\r\nsoft, and of an irregular shape. When the cause of alarm is removed,\r\nthey are retracted, so that only a small portion of them appears[331].\r\n\r\nInsects often endeavour to repel or escape from assailants by their\r\n_motions_. Mr. White, mentioning a wild bee that makes its nest on\r\nthe summit of a remarkable hill near Lewes in Sussex, in the chalky\r\nsoil, says: \"When people approach the place these insects begin to\r\nbe alarmed, and with a sharp and hostile sound dash and strike round\r\nthe heads and faces of intruders. I have often been interrupted\r\nmyself while contemplating the grandeur of the scenery around me, and\r\nhave thought myself in danger of being stung[332].\"--The hive-bee\r\nwill sometimes have recourse to the same expedient, when her hive is\r\napproached too near, and thus give you notice what you may expect if\r\nyou do not take her warning and retire.--Humble-bees when disturbed,\r\nwhether out of the nest or in it, assume some very grotesque and at\r\nthe same time threatening attitudes. If you put your finger to them,\r\nthey will either successively or simultaneously lift up the three\r\nlegs of one side; turn themselves upon their back; bend up their anus\r\nand show their sting accompanied by a drop of poison. Sometimes they\r\nwill even spirt out that liquor. When in the nest, if it be attacked,\r\nthey also beat their wings violently and emit a great hum[333].\r\n\r\nThese motions menace vengeance; those of some other insects are\r\nmerely to effect their escape. Thus I have observed that the species\r\nof the May-fly tribe (_Trichoptera_[334]), when I have attempted to\r\ntake them, have often glided away from under my hand--without moving\r\ntheir limbs that I could discover--in a remarkable manner. I once\r\nobserved a short-snouted weevil (_Brachyrhynchus_, Schön.) upon a\r\nrail, which, when it saw me, slided sideways, and then rolled off.\r\nTo notice the ordinary motions of insects, which are often means by\r\nwhich they escape from danger, would here be premature, since they\r\nwill be fully considered in a subsequent letter. I shall therefore\r\nonly mention the zigzag flight of butterflies and the traverse\r\nsailing of humble-bees, which certainly render it more difficult for\r\nthe birds to catch them while on the wing.\r\n\r\n_Noises_ are another mean of defence to which insects have occasional\r\nrecourse. I have heard the lunar dung-beetle (_Copris lunaris_) when\r\ndisturbed utter a shrill sound. _Dynastes Oromedon_, another of\r\nthe lamellicorn insects, was observed by Dr. Arnold to make, when\r\nalarmed, a kind of creaking noise, which it produced by rubbing\r\nits abdomen against its elytra. A third of the same tribe, (_Trox\r\nsabulosus_) emits a small sibilant or chirping noise, as I once\r\nobserved when I found several feeding in a ram's horn. The \"drowsy\r\nhum\" of beetles, humble-bees, and other insects, in their flight,\r\nmay tend to preserve them from some of their aërial assailants.\r\nAnd the angry chidings of the inhabitants of the hive, which are\r\nvery distinguishable from their ordinary sounds, may be regarded as\r\nwarning voices to those from whom they apprehend evil or an attack.\r\nI have before observed that the death's-head hawk-moth (_Acherontia\r\nAtropos_), when menaced by the stings of ten thousand bees enraged\r\nat her depredations upon their property, possesses the secret to\r\ndisarm them of their fury[335]. This insect, when in fear or danger,\r\nis known to produce a sharp, shrill, mournful cry, which with the\r\nsuperstitious has added to the alarm produced by the symbol of death\r\nwhich signalizes its thorax[336]. This cry, there is reason to\r\nbelieve, affects and disarms the bees, so as to enable her to proceed\r\nin her spoliations with impunity[337]. One of these insects being\r\nonce brought to a learned divine, who was also an entomologist, when\r\nhe was unwell, he was so much moved by its plaintive noise, that,\r\ninstead of devoting it to destruction, he gave the animal its life\r\nand liberty. I might say more upon this subject of defensive noises:\r\nbut I shall reserve what I have further to communicate, to a letter\r\nwhich I purpose devoting to the sounds produced or emitted by insects.\r\n\r\nYou are acquainted with the singular property of the skunk (_Viverra\r\nputorius_, L.), which repels its assailants by the fetid vapour that\r\nit explodes; but perhaps are not aware that the Creator has endowed\r\nmany insects with the same property and for the same purpose--some of\r\nwhich exhale powerful or disagreeable _odours_ at all times, and from\r\nthe general surface of their body; while they issue from others only\r\nthrough particular organs, and when they are attacked.\r\n\r\nOf the former description of defensive scents there are numerous\r\nexamples in almost every order; for, next to plants and vegetable\r\nsubstances, insects, of any part of the creation, afford the\r\ngreatest diversity of odours. In the _Coleoptera_ order a very\r\ncommon beetle, the whirlwig (_Gyrinus Natator_), will infect your\r\nfinger for a long time with a disagreeable rancid smell; while two\r\nother species, _G. minutus_ and _villosus_, are scentless.--Those\r\nunclean feeders, the carrion beetles (_Silpha_, L.), as might be\r\nexpected from the nature of their food, are at the same time very\r\nfetid.--Pliny tells us of a Blatta,--which, from his description,\r\nis evidently the darkling-beetle (_Blaps mortisaga_), and which he\r\nrecommends as an infallible nostrum, when applied with oil extracted\r\nfrom the cedar, in otherwise incurable ulcers,--that was an object\r\nof general disgust on account of its ill scent, a character which it\r\nstill maintains[338].--Numbers of the ground-beetles (_Eutrechina_)\r\nthat are found under stones, and in places that have not a free\r\ncirculation of air, exhale a most disagreeable and penetrating odour,\r\nwhich De Geer observes resembles that of rancid butter, and is not\r\nsoon got rid of. It is produced, he says, from an unctuous matter\r\nthat transpires through the body[339]; but I am rather inclined to\r\nthink it proceeds from the extremity.--I have noticed that some\r\nsmall beetles of the _Omalium_ genus--for instance _O. rivulare_,\r\nand another species that I once found in abundance on the primrose\r\n(_O. Primulæ_, K. Ms.), especially the latter--are abominably fetid\r\nwhen taken, and that it requires more than one washing to free\r\nthe fingers from it. Every one knows that the cock-roach (_Blatta\r\norientalis_), belonging to the _Orthoptera_ order, is not remarkable\r\nfor a pleasant scent;--but none are more notorious for their bad\r\ncharacter in this respect than the bug tribe (_Geocorisæ_), which\r\nalmost universally exhale an odour that mixes with the scent of\r\ncucumbers another extremely unpleasant and annoying. Some however\r\nare less disgusting, particularly _Lygæus Hyoscyami_, which\r\nyields, De Geer found, an agreeable odour of thyme[340].--Several\r\nlepidopterous larvæ are defended by their ill smell; but I shall\r\nonly particularize the silk-worms, which on that account are said\r\nto be unwholesome.--_Phryganea grandis_, a kind of May-fly, is a\r\n_trichopterous_ insect that offends the nostrils in this way; but\r\na worse is _Chrysopa Perla_, a golden-eyed and lace-winged fly, of\r\nthe next order, whose beauty is counterbalanced by a strong scent of\r\nhuman ordure that proceeds from it.--Numberless _Hymenoptera_ act\r\nupon the olfactory nerves by their ill or powerful effluvia. One of\r\nthem, an ant _(Formica fœtida_ De Geer, _fœtens_ Oliv.), has the same\r\nsmell with the insect last mentioned[341]. Our common black ant (_F.\r\nfuliginosa_), whose curious nests in trees have been before described\r\nto you[342], is an insect of a powerful and penetrating scent,\r\nwhich it imparts to every thing with which it comes in contact;\r\nand Fabricius distinguishes another (_F. analis_, Latr., _fœtens_,\r\nF.) by an epithet (_fœtidissima_) which sufficiently declares its\r\nproperties. Many wild bees (_Andrena_) are distinguished by their\r\npungent alliaceous smell. _Crabro U. flavum_, a wasp-like insect, is\r\nremarkable for the penetrating and spirituous effluvia of ether that\r\nit exhales[343]. Indeed there is scarcely any species in this order\r\nthat has not a peculiar scent.--Some dipterous insects--though these\r\nin general neither offend nor delight us by it--are distinguished by\r\ntheir smell. Thus _Mesembrina mystacea_, a fly that in its grub state\r\nlives in cow-dung, savours in this respect, when a denizen of the\r\nair, of the substance in which it first drew breath[344]. And another\r\n(_Sepsis cynipsea_,) emits a fragrant odour of baum[345].--I have not\r\nmuch to tell you with respect to apterous insects, except that _Iulus\r\nterrestris_, a common millepede, leaves a strong and disagreeable\r\nscent upon the fingers when handled[346]. Most of the insects I have\r\nhere enumerated, probably, are defended from some enemy or injury by\r\nthe strong vapours that exhale from them; and perhaps some in the\r\nlist produce it from particular organs not yet noticed.\r\n\r\nI shall next beg your attention to those insects that emit their smell\r\nfrom particular organs. Of these, some are furnished with a kind of\r\nscent-vessels, which I shall call _osmateria_; while in others it\r\nissues from the intestines at the ordinary passage. In the former\r\ninstance the organ is usually retractile within the body, being only\r\nexerted when it is used: it is generally a bifid vessel, something\r\nin the shape of the letter Y. Linné, in his generic character of the\r\nrove-beetles (_Staphylinidæ_), mentions two oblong vesicles as proper\r\nto this genus. These organs,--which are by no means common to the\r\nwhole genus, even as restricted by late writers,--are its _osmateria_,\r\nand give forth the scent for which some species, particularly\r\n_Ocypus brunnipes_, are remarkable. If you press the abdomen hard,\r\nyou will find that these vesicles are only branches from a common\r\nstem; and you may easily ascertain that the smell of this insect,\r\nwhich mixes something extremely fetid with a spicy odour, proceeds\r\nfrom their extremity.--A similar organ, half an inch in length, and\r\nof the same shape, issues from the neck of the caterpillar of the\r\nswallow-tail-butterfly (_Papilio Machaon_)[347]. When I pressed this\r\ncaterpillar, says Bonnet, near its anterior part, it darted forth\r\nits horn as if it meant to prick me with it, directing it towards\r\nmy fingers; but it withdrew it as soon as I left off pressing it.\r\nThis horn smells strongly of fennel, and probably is employed by the\r\ninsect, by means of its powerful scent, to drive away the flies and\r\nichneumons that annoy it. A similar horn is protruded by the slimy\r\nlarva of _P. Anchises_, as also _Parnassius Apollo_ and many other\r\n_Equites_[348].--Another insect, the larva of a species of saw-fly\r\ndescribed by De Geer, is furnished with osmateria, or scent-organs,\r\nof a different kind. They are situated between the five first pair of\r\nintermediate legs, which they exceed in size, and are perforated at\r\nthe end like the rose of a watering-pot. If you touch the insect, they\r\nshoot out like the horns of a snail, and emit a most nauseous odour,\r\nwhich remains long upon the finger; but when the pressure is removed\r\nthey are withdrawn within the body[349].--The grub of the poplar-beetle\r\n(_Chrysomela Populi_) also is remarkable for similar organs. On each\r\nof the nine intermediate dorsal segments of its body is a pair of\r\nblack, elevated, conical tubercles, of a hard substance; from all of\r\nthese when touched the animal emits a small drop of a white milky\r\nfluid, the smell of which, De Geer observes, is almost insupportable,\r\nbeing inexpressibly strong and penetrating. These drops proceed at\r\nthe same instant from all the eighteen scent-organs; which forms a\r\ncurious spectacle. The insect, however, does not waste this precious\r\nfluid: each drop instead of falling, after appearing for a moment and\r\ndispensing its perfume, is withdrawn again within its receptacle, till\r\nthe pressure is repeated, when it reappears[350].\r\n\r\nI shall now introduce you to the true counterparts of the skunk,\r\nwhich explode a most fetid vapour from the ordinary passage. I have\r\nlately hinted that the scent of many _Eutrechina_ is thus emitted.\r\n_Anchomenus prasinus_, a beetle of this tribe, combats its enemies\r\nwith repeated discharges of smoke and noise: but the most famous\r\nfor their exploits in this way are those, which on this account\r\nare distinguished by the name of bombardiers (_Brachinus_). The\r\nmost common species (_B. crepitans_), which is found occasionally\r\nin many parts of Britain, when pursued by its great enemy,\r\n_Calosoma Inquisitor_, seems at first to have no mode of escape:\r\nwhen suddenly a loud explosion is heard, and a blue smoke attended\r\nby a very disagreeable scent, is seen to proceed from its anus,\r\nwhich immediately stops the progress of its assailant: when it has\r\nrecovered from the effect of it, and the pursuit is renewed, a\r\nsecond discharge again arrests its course. The bombardier can fire\r\nits artillery twenty times in succession if necessary, and so gain\r\ntime to effect its escape.--Another species (_B. Displosor_) makes\r\nexplosions similar to those of _B. crepitans_: when irritated it\r\ncan give ten or twelve good discharges; but afterwards, instead of\r\nsmoke it emits a yellow or brown fluid. By bending the joints of its\r\nabdomen it can direct its smoke to any particular point. M. Leon\r\nDufour observes that this smoke has a strong and pungent odour,\r\nwhich has a striking analogy with that exhaled by the Nitric Acid.\r\nIt is caustic, reddening white paper, and producing on the skin the\r\nsensation of burning, and forming red spots, which pass into brown,\r\nand though washed remain several days[351].\r\n\r\nAnother expedient to which insects have recourse to rid themselves\r\nof their enemies, is the emission of disagreeable _fluids_. These\r\nsome discharge from the mouth; others from the anus; others again\r\nfrom the joints of the limbs and segments of the body; and a few from\r\nappropriate organs.\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless often observed a black beetle crossing pathways\r\nwith a slow pace, which feeds upon the different species of bedstraw\r\n(_Galium_), called by some the bloody-nose beetle (_Timarcha\r\ntenebricosa_). This insect, when taken, usually ejects from its mouth\r\na clear drop or two of red fluid, which will stain paper of an orange\r\ncolour. The carrion-beetles (_Silpha_ and _Necrophorus_), as also\r\nthe larger _Carabi_, defile us, if handled roughly, with brown fetid\r\nsaliva. Mr. Sheppard having taken one of the latter (_C. violaceus_),\r\napplied it in joke to his son's face, and was surprised to hear him\r\nimmediately cry out as if hurt: repeating the experiment with another\r\nof his boys, he complained of its making him smart: upon this he\r\ntouched himself with it, and it caused as much pain as if, after\r\nshaving, he had rubbed his face with spirits of wine. This he observed\r\nwas not invariably the case with this beetle, its saliva at other times\r\nbeing harmless. Hence he conjectures that its caustic nature, in the\r\ninstance here recorded, might arise from its food; which he had reason\r\nto think had at that time been the electric centipede (_Geophilus\r\nelectricus_).--Lesser having once touched the anal horn of the\r\ncaterpillar of some sphinx, suddenly turning its head round it vomited\r\nupon his hand a quantity of green viscous and very fetid fluid, which,\r\nthough he washed it frequently with soap and fumed it with sulphur,\r\ninfected it for two days[352].--Lister relates that he saw a spider,\r\nwhen upon being provoked it attempted to bite, emit several times small\r\ndrops of very clear fluid[353].--Mr. Briggs observed a caterpillar\r\ncaught in the web of one of our largest spiders, by means of a fluid\r\nwhich it sent forth entirely dissolve the great breadth of threads with\r\nwhich the latter endeavoured to envelop it, as fast as produced, till\r\nthe spider appeared quite exhausted[354].--The caterpillars also of a\r\nparticular tribe of saw-flies, remarkable for the beautiful pennated\r\nantennæ of the males (_Pteronus_)[355], when disturbed eject a drop of\r\nfluid from their mouth. Those of one species inhabiting the fir-tree\r\n(_Pt. Pini_) are ordinarily stationed on the narrow leaves of that\r\ntree--which they devour most voraciously in the manner that we eat\r\nradishes--with their head towards the point. Sometimes two are engaged\r\nopposite to each other on the same leaf. They collect in groups often\r\nof more than a hundred, and keep as close to each other as they can.\r\nWhen a branch is stripped they all move together to another. If one of\r\nthese caterpillars be touched or disturbed, it immediately with a twist\r\nlifts the anterior part of its body, and emits from its mouth a drop of\r\nclear resin, perfectly similar both in odour and consistence to that of\r\nthe fir[356]. What is still more remarkable, no sooner does a single\r\nindividual of the group give itself this motion, than all the rest, as\r\nif they were moved by a spring, instantaneously do the same[357]. Thus\r\nthese animals fire a volley as it were at their annoyers, the scent of\r\nwhich is probably sufficient to discomfit any ichneumons, flies, or\r\npredaceous beetles that may be desirous of attacking them.\r\n\r\nAmongst those which annoy their enemies by the emission of fluids\r\nfrom their anus are the larger Carabi. These, if roughly handled,\r\nwill spirt to a considerable distance an acrid, caustic, stinking\r\nliquor, which if it touch the eyes or the lips occasions considerable\r\npain[358].--The rose-scented capricorn (_Cerambyx moschatus_)\r\nproduced a similar effect upon Mr. Sheppard by similar means. The\r\nfluid in this had a powerful odour of musk.--The acid of ants has\r\nlong been celebrated, and is one of their most powerful means of\r\ndefence. When the species that have no sting make a wound with their\r\njaws, they insinuate into it some of this acid, the effluvia produced\r\nby which are so subtile and penetrating, that it is impossible to\r\nhold your head near the nest of the hill-ant (_Formica rufa_), when\r\nthe ants are much disturbed, without being almost suffocated. This\r\nodour thus proceeding from myriads of ants, is powerful enough, it is\r\nsaid, to kill a frog, and is probably the means of securing the nest\r\nfrom the attack of many enemies.--Dr. Arnold observed a species of\r\nbug (_Scutellera_) abundant upon some polygamous plant which he could\r\nnot determine, and in all their different states. They were attended\r\nclosely by hosts of ants, and when disturbed emitted a very strong\r\nsmell. One of these insects ejected a minute drop of fluid into one\r\nof his eyes, which occasioned for some hours considerable pain and\r\ninflammation. In the evening, however, they appeared to subside;--but\r\non the following morning the inflammation was renewed, became worse\r\nthan ever, and lasted for three days.\r\n\r\nOther insects, when under alarm, discharge a fluid from the joints\r\nand segments of their body. You have often seen what has been called\r\nthe unctuous or oil beetle (_Meloe Proscarabæus_), and I dare say,\r\nwhen you took it, have observed orange-coloured or deep-yellow drops\r\nappear at its joints. As these insects feed upon acrid plants, the\r\nspecies of crowfoot or _Ranunculus_, it is probable that this fluid\r\npartakes of the nature of their food and is very acrimonious--and\r\nthus may put to flight its insect assailants or the birds, from\r\nneither of which it could otherwise escape, being a very slow and\r\nsluggish and at the same time very conspicuous animal. Another beetle\r\n(_Ellenophorus collaris_) has likewise this faculty.--The lady-bird,\r\nwe know, has been recommended as a cure for the tooth-ache. This\r\nidea may have taken its rise from a secretion of this kind being\r\nnoticed upon it. I have observed that one species (_Coccinella\r\nbipunctata_) when taken ejects from its joints a yellow fluid\r\nwhich yields a powerful but not agreeable scent of opium.--_Asilus\r\ncrabroniformis_, a dipterous insect, once when I took it, emitted\r\na white milky fluid from its proboscis, the joints of the legs and\r\nabdomen, and the anus.--The common scorpion-fly, likewise, upon the\r\nsame occasion ejects from its proboscis a brown and fetid drop[359].\r\nSome insects have peculiar organs from which their fluids issue, or\r\nare ejaculated. Thus the larvæ of saw-flies when taken into the hand\r\ncover themselves with drops, exuding from all parts of their body,\r\nof an unpleasant penetrating scent[360]. That of _Cimbex lutea_, of\r\nthe same tribe, from a small hole just above each spiracle, syringes\r\na similar fluid in horizontal jets of the diameter of a thread,\r\nsometimes to the distance of more than a foot[361].--The caterpillar\r\nof the great emperor moth (_Saturnia Pyri_,) also spirts out, when\r\nthe spines that cover them are touched, clear lymph from its pierced\r\ntubercles[362].--Willughby has remarked a curious circumstance with\r\nrespect to a water-beetle (_Acilius sulcatus_), which ought not to be\r\noverlooked. A transverse line of a pale colour is observable upon the\r\nelytra of the male; where this line terminates certain oblong pores\r\nare visible, from which he affirms he has often seen a milky fluid\r\nexuding[363]; and what may confirm his statement, I have more than\r\nonce observed such a fluid issue from the male of this genus.--The\r\ncaterpillar of the puss-moth (_Cerura vinula_), as well as those of\r\nseveral other species, has a cleft in the neck between the head and\r\nthe first pair of legs. From this issues, at the will of the animal,\r\na singular syringe, laterally bifid; the branches of which are\r\nterminated by a nipple perforated like the rose of a watering-pot.\r\nBy means of this organ, when touched, it will syringe a fluid to a\r\nconsiderable distance, which, if it enters the eyes, gives them acute\r\nbut not lasting pain. The animal when taken from the tree on which\r\nit feeds, though supplied with its leaves, loses this faculty, with\r\nwhich it is probably endowed to drive off the ichneumons that infest\r\nit[364].--And, to name no more, the great tiger-moth (_Euprepia\r\nCaja_), when in its last or perfect state, has near its head a\r\nremarkable tuft of the most brilliant carmine, from amongst the hairs\r\nof which, if the thorax be touched, some minute drops of transparent\r\nwater issue, doubtless for some similar purpose[365].\r\n\r\nThe next active means of defence with which Creative Wisdom has\r\nendowed these busy tribes, are those _limbs_ or _weapons_ with which\r\nthey are furnished. The insect lately mentioned, the puss-moth,\r\nbesides the syringes just described, is remarkable for its singular\r\nforked tail, entirely dissimilar to the anal termination of the\r\nabdomen of most other caterpillars. This tail is composed of two\r\nlong cylindrical tubes moveable at their base, and beset with a\r\ngreat number of short stiff spines. When the animal walks, the two\r\nbranches of the tail are separated from each other, and at every\r\nstep are lowered so as to touch the plane of position; hence we may\r\nconclude that they assist it in this motion and supply the place of\r\nhind legs. If you touch or otherwise incommode it, from each of the\r\nabove branches there issues a long, cylindrical, slender, fleshy, and\r\nvery flexible organ of a rose colour, to which the caterpillar can\r\ngive every imaginable curve or inflection, causing it sometimes to\r\nassume even a spiral form. It enters the tube, or issues from it, in\r\nthe same manner as the horns of snails or slugs. These tails form a\r\nkind of double whip, the tubes representing the handle, and the horns\r\nthe thong or lash with which the animal drives away the ichneumons\r\nand flies that attempt to settle upon it. Touch any part of the body,\r\nand immediately one or both the horns will appear and be extended;\r\nand the animal will, as it were, lash the spot where it feels that\r\nyou incommode it. De Geer, from whom this account is taken, says\r\nthat this caterpillar will bite very sharply[366].--Several larvæ\r\nof butterflies, distinguished at their head by a semicoronet of\r\nstrong spines, figured by Madame Merian, are armed with singular\r\nanal organs[367], which may have a similar use. Rösel when he first\r\nsaw the caterpillar of the puss-moth, stretched out his hand with\r\ngreat eagerness, so he tells us, to take the prize; but when in\r\naddition to its grim attitude he beheld it dart forth these menacing\r\ncatapults, apprehending they might be poisonous organs, his courage\r\nfailed him. At length, without touching the monster, he ventured to\r\ncut off the twig on which it was, and let it drop into a box[368]!\r\nThe caterpillar of the gold-tail moth (_Arctia chrysorhœa_) has a\r\nremarkable aperture, which it can open and shut, surrounded by a rim\r\non the upper part of each segment. This aperture includes a little\r\ncavity, from which it has the power of darting forth small flocks\r\nof a cottony matter that fills it[369]. This manœuvre is probably\r\nconnected with our present subject, and employed to defend it from\r\nits enemies. It also ejects a fluid from its anus.\r\n\r\nThere is a moth in New Holland, the larva of which annoys its foes\r\nin a different way: from eight tubercles in its back it darts forth,\r\nwhen alarmed, as many bunches of little stings, by which it inflicts\r\nvery painful and venomous wounds[370].\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of the moth of the beech (_Stauropus Fagi_),\r\ncalled the lobster, is distinguished by the uncommon length of its\r\nanterior legs. Mr. Stephens, an acute entomologist, relates to me\r\nthat he once saw this animal use them to rid itself of a mite that\r\nincommoded it. They are probably equally useful in delivering it from\r\nthe ichneumon and its other insect enemies.--Dr. Arnold has made\r\na curious observation (confirmed by Dr. Forsström with respect to\r\nothers of the genus) on the use of the long processes or tails that\r\ndistinguish the secondary wings of _Thecla Iarbas_. These processes,\r\nhe remarks, resemble antennæ, and when the butterfly is sitting it\r\nkeeps them in constant motion; so that at first sight it appears to\r\nhave a head at each extremity; which deception is much increased by a\r\nspot resembling an eye at the base of the processes. These insects,\r\nperhaps, thus perplex or alarm their assailants.--Goedart pretended\r\nthat the anal horn with which the caterpillars of so many hawk-moths\r\n(_Sphingidæ_) are armed, answers the end of a sting instilling a\r\ndangerous venom: but the observations of modern entomologists have\r\nproved that this is altogether fabulous, since the animal has not\r\nthe power of moving them[371]. Their use is still unknown.\r\n\r\nWhether the long and often threatening horns on the head, thorax,\r\nand even elytra, with which many insects are armed, are beneficial\r\nto them in the view under consideration, is very uncertain. They are\r\nfrequently sexual distinctions, and have a reference probably rather\r\nto sexual purposes and the economy of the animal, than to any thing\r\nelse. They may, however, in some instances deter enemies from attacking\r\nthem, and therefore it was right not to omit them wholly, though I\r\nshall not further enlarge upon them.--Their mandibles or upper jaws,\r\nthough principally intended for mastication,--and in the case of the\r\n_Hymenoptera_, as instruments for various economical and mechanical\r\nuses,--are often employed to annoy their enemies or assailants. I once\r\nsuffered considerable pain from the bite of the common water-beetle\r\n(_Dytiscus marginalis_), as well as from that of the great rove-beetle\r\n(_Goerius olens_); but the most tremendous and effectual weapon with\r\nwhich insects are armed--though this, except in the case of the\r\nscorpion, is also a sexual instrument, and useful to the females in\r\noviposition--is their sting. With this they keep not only the larger\r\nanimals, but even man himself, in awe and at a distance. But on these I\r\nenlarged sufficiently in a former letter[372].\r\n\r\nThese weapons, fearful as they are, would be of but little use to\r\ninsects if they had not courage to employ them: in this quality,\r\nhowever, they are by no means deficient; for, their diminutive size\r\nconsidered, they are, many of them, the most valiant animals in\r\nnature. The giant bulk of an elephant would not deter a hornet, a\r\nbee, or even an ant, from attacking it, if it was provoked. I once\r\nobserved a small spider walking in my path. On putting my stick\r\nto it, it immediately turned round as if to defend itself. On the\r\napproach of my finger, it lifted itself up and stretched out its legs\r\nto meet it.--In Ray's Letters mention is made of a singular combat\r\nbetween a spider and a toad fought at Hetcorne near Sittinghurst[373]\r\nin Kent; but as the particulars and issue of this famous duel are\r\nnot given, I can only mention the circumstance, and conjecture that\r\nthe spider was victorious[374]! Terrible as is the dragon-fly to the\r\ninsect world in general, putting to flight and devouring whole hosts\r\nof butterflies, may-flies, and others of its tribes, it instills no\r\nterror into the stout heart of the scorpion-fly (_Panorpa communis_),\r\nthough much its inferior in size and strength. Lyonnet saw one attack\r\na dragon-fly of ten times its own bigness, bring it to the ground,\r\npierce it repeatedly with its proboscis; and had he not by his\r\neagerness parted them, he doubts not it would have destroyed this\r\ntyrant of the insect creation[375].\r\n\r\nWhen the death's-head-hawk-moth was introduced by Huber into a nest\r\nof humble-bees, they were not affected by it, like the hive-bees,\r\nbut attacked it and drove it out of their nest, and in one instance\r\ntheir stings proved fatal to it[376].--A black ground-beetle devours\r\nthe eggs of the mole cricket, or _Gryllotalpa_. To defend them, the\r\nfemale places herself at the entrance of the nest--which is a neatly\r\nsmoothed and rounded chamber protected by labyrinths, ditches, and\r\nramparts--and whenever the beetle attempts to seize its prey, she\r\ncatches it and bites it asunder[377].\r\n\r\nI know nothing more astonishing than the wonderful muscular strength\r\nof insects, which in proportion to their size exceeds that of any\r\nother class of animals, and is likewise to be reckoned amongst their\r\nmeans of defence. Take one of the common chafers or dung-beetles\r\n(_Geotrupes stercorarius_, or _Copris lunaris_), into your hand,\r\nand observe how he makes his way in spite of your utmost pressure;\r\nand read the accounts which authors have left us of the very great\r\nweights that a flea will easily move, as if a single man should draw\r\na waggon with forty or fifty hundred weight of hay:--but upon this I\r\nshall touch hereafter, and therefore only hint at it now.\r\n\r\nWe are next to consider the modes of _concealment_ to which insects\r\nhave recourse in order to escape the observation of their enemies.\r\nOne is by covering themselves with various substances. Of this\r\ndescription is a little water-beetle (_Elophorus aquaticus_), which\r\nis always found covered with mud, and so when feeding at the bottom\r\nof a pool or pond can scarcely be distinguished, by the predaceous\r\naquatic insects, from the soil on which it rests. Another very minute\r\ninsect of the same order (_Limnius æneus_) that is found in rivulets\r\nunder stones and the like, sometimes conceals its elytra with a\r\nthick coating of sand, that becomes nearly as hard as stone. I never\r\nmet with these animals so circumstanced but once; then, however,\r\nthere were several which had thus defended themselves, and I can\r\nnow show you a specimen.--A species of a minute coleopterous genus\r\n(_Georyssus areniferus_[378]), which lives in wet spots where the\r\ntoad-rush (_Juncus bufonius_) grows, covers itself with sand; and\r\nanother nearly related to it (_Chætophorus cretiferus_, K.) which\r\nfrequents chalk, whitens itself all over with that substance. As this\r\nanimal, when clean, is very black, were it not for this manœuvre, it\r\nwould be too conspicuous upon its white territory to have any chance\r\nof escape from the birds and its other assailants.--No insect is\r\nmore celebrated for rendering itself hideous by a coat of dirt than\r\nthe _Reduvius personatus_, a kind of bug sometimes found in houses.\r\nWhen in its two preparatory states, every part of its body, even\r\nits legs and antennæ, is so covered with the dust of apartments,\r\nconsisting of a mixture of particles of sand, fragments of wool or\r\nsilk, and similar matters, that the animal at first would be taken\r\nfor one of the ugliest spiders. This grotesque appearance is aided\r\nand increased by motions equally awkward and grotesque, upon which\r\nI shall enlarge hereafter. If you touch it with a hair-pencil or a\r\nfeather, this clothing will soon be removed, and you may behold the\r\ncreature unmasked, and in its proper form. It is an insect of prey;\r\nand amongst other victims will devour its more hateful congener the\r\nbed-bug[379]. Its slow movements, combined with its covering, seem to\r\nindicate that the object of these manœuvres is to conceal itself from\r\nobservation, probably, both of its enemies and of its prey. It is\r\ntherefore properly noticed under my present head.\r\n\r\nAs Hercules, after he had slain the Nemean lion, made a doublet of\r\nits skin, so the larva of another insect (_Hemerobius Chrysops_, a\r\nlace-winged fly with golden eyes,) covers itself with the skins of\r\nthe luckless Aphides that it has slain and devoured. From the head to\r\nthe tail, this pygmy destroyer of the helpless is defended by a thick\r\ncoat, or rather mountain composed of the skins, limbs, and down of\r\nthese creatures. Reaumur, in order to ascertain how far this covering\r\nwas necessary, removed it, and put the animal into a glass, at one\r\ntime with a silk cocoon, and at another with raspings of paper. In\r\nthe first instance, in the space of an hour it had clothed itself\r\nwith particles of the silk: and in the second, being again laid bare,\r\nit found the paper so convenient a material, that it made of it a\r\ncoat of unusual thickness[380].\r\n\r\nInsects in general are remarkable for their cleanliness;--however\r\nfilthy the substances which they inhabit, yet they so manage as\r\nto keep themselves personally neat. Several, however, by no means\r\ndeserve this character; and I fear you will scarcely credit me when\r\nI tell you that some shelter themselves under an umbrella formed of\r\ntheir own excrement! You will exclaim, perhaps, that there is no\r\nparallel case in all nature;--it may be so;--yet as I am bound to\r\nconfess the faults of insects as well as to extol their virtues, I\r\nmust not conceal from you this opprobrium. Beetles of three different\r\ngenera are given to this Hottentot habit. The first to which I shall\r\nintroduce you is one that has long been celebrated under the name\r\nof the beetle of the lily (_Lema merdigera_, _Cantaride de' Gigli_,\r\nVallisn.) The larvæ of this insect have a very tender skin, which\r\nappears to require some covering from the impressions of the external\r\nair and from the rays of the sun; and it finds nothing so well\r\nadapted to answer these purposes, and probably also to conceal itself\r\nfrom the birds, as its own excrement, with which it covers itself\r\nin the following manner. Its anus is remarkably situated, being on\r\nthe back of the last segment of the body, and not at or under its\r\nextremity, as obtains in most insects. By means of such a position,\r\nthe excrement when it issues from the body, instead of being pushed\r\naway and falling, is lifted up above the back in the direction of the\r\nhead. When entirely clear of the passage, it falls, and is retained,\r\nthough slightly, by its viscosity. The grub next, by a movement\r\nof its segments, conducts it from the place where it fell to the\r\nvicinity of the head. It effects this by swelling the segment on\r\nwhich the excrement is deposited, and contracting the following one,\r\nso that it necessarily moves that way. Although, when discharged, it\r\nhas a longitudinal direction, by the same action of the segments the\r\nanimal contrives to place every grain transversely. Thus, when laid\r\nquite bare, it will cover itself in about two hours. There are often\r\nmany layers of these grains upon the back of the insect, so as to\r\nform a coat of greater diameter than its body. When it becomes too\r\nheavy and stiff, it is thrown off, and a new one begun[381].--The\r\nlarvæ of the various species of the tortoise-beetles (_Cassida_,\r\nL.) have all of them, as far as they are known, similar habits, and\r\nare furnished besides with a singular apparatus, by means of which\r\nthey can elevate or drop their stercorarious parasol so as most\r\neffectually to shelter or shade them. The instrument by which they\r\neffect this is an anal fork, upon which they deposit their excrement,\r\nand which in some is turned up and lies flat upon their backs; and in\r\nothers forms different angles, from very acute to very obtuse, with\r\ntheir body; and occasionally is unbent and in the same direction with\r\nit[382]. In some species the excrement is not so disgusting as you\r\nmay suppose, being formed into fine branching filaments. This is the\r\ncase with _C. maculata_, L.[383].--In the cognate genus _Imatidium_,\r\nthe larvæ also are merdigerous; and that of _I. Leayanum_, Latr.,\r\ntaken by Major-General Hardwicke in the East Indies, also produces an\r\nassemblage of very long filaments, that resemble a dried fucus or a\r\nfilamentous lichen.--The clothing of the _Tineæ_, clothes-moths and\r\nothers, and also of the case-worms, having enlarged upon in a former\r\nletter[384], I need not describe here.\r\n\r\nSome insects, that they may not be discovered and become the prey of\r\ntheir enemies when they are reposing, conceal themselves in flowers.\r\nThe male of a little bee (_Heriades_[385] _Campanularum_), a true\r\nSybarite, dozes voluptuously in the bells of the different species of\r\n_Campanula_--in which, indeed, I have often found other kinds asleep.\r\nLinné named another species _florisomnis_ on account of a similar\r\npropensity. A third, a most curious and rare species (_Andrena_[386]\r\n_spinigera_), shelters itself when sleeping, at least I once found it\r\nthere so circumstanced, in the nest-like umbel of the wild carrot.\r\nYou would think it a most extraordinary freak of Nature, should any\r\nquadruped sleep suspended by its jaws, (some birds however are said,\r\nI think, to have such a habit, and _Sus Babyroussa_ one something\r\nlike it,)--yet insects do this occasionally. Linné informs us that\r\na little bee (_Epeolus_[387] _variegatus_) passes the night thus\r\nsuspended to the beak of the flowers of _Geranium phæum_: and I once\r\nfound one of the vespiform bees (_Nomada_[388] _Goodeniana_) hanging\r\nby its mandibles from the edge of a hazel-leaf, apparently asleep,\r\nwith its limbs relaxed and folded. On being disengaged from its\r\nsituation it became perfectly lively.\r\n\r\nThere is no period of their existence in which insects usually are\r\nless able to help themselves, than during that intermediate state of\r\nrepose which precedes their coming forth in their perfect forms. I\r\nformerly explained to you how large a portion of them during this\r\nstate cease to be locomotive, and assume an appearance of death[389].\r\nIn this helpless condition, unless Providence had furnished them\r\nwith some means of security, they must fall an easy prey to the most\r\ninsignificant of their assailants. But even here they are taught\r\nto conceal themselves from their enemies by various and singular\r\ncontrivances. Some seek for safety by burying themselves, previously\r\nto the assumption of the pupa, at a considerable depth under the\r\nearth; others bore into the heart of trees, or into pieces of timber;\r\nsome take their residence in the hollow stalks of plants; and many\r\nare concealed under leaves, or suspend themselves in dark places,\r\nwhere they cannot readily be seen. But in this state they are not\r\nonly defended from harm by the situation they select, but also by\r\nthe covering in which numbers envelop themselves; for, besides the\r\nleathery case that defends the yet tender and unformed imago, many of\r\nthese animals know how to weave for it a costly shroud of the finest\r\nmaterials, through which few of its enemies can make their way;--and to\r\nthis curious instinct, as I long since observed, we owe one of the most\r\nvaluable articles of commerce, the silk that gives lustre to the beauty\r\nof our females. These shrouds are sometimes double. Thus the larvæ of\r\ncertain saw-flies spin for themselves a cocoon of a soft, flexible, and\r\nclose texture, which they surround with an exterior one composed of a\r\nstrong kind of net-work, which withstands pressure like a racket[390].\r\nHere nature has provided that the inclosed animal shall be protected\r\nby the interior cocoon from the injury it might be exposed to from\r\nthe harshness of the exterior, while the latter by its strength and\r\ntension prevents it from being hurt by any external pressure.\r\n\r\nBut of all the contrivances by which insects in this state are secured\r\nfrom their enemies, there is none more ingenious than that to which\r\nthe may-flies (_Trichoptera_) have recourse for this purpose. You have\r\nheard before that these insects are at first aquatic, and inhabit\r\ncurious cases made of a variety of materials, which are usually open\r\nat each end[391]. Since they must reside in these cases, when they are\r\nbecome pupæ, till the time of their final change approaches, if they\r\nare left open, how are the animals, now become torpid, to keep out\r\ntheir enemies? Or, if they are wholly closed, how is the water, which\r\nis necessary to their respiration and life, to be introduced? These\r\nsagacious creatures know how to compass both these ends at once. They\r\nfix a grate or portcullis to each extremity of their fortress, which at\r\nthe same time keeps out intruders and admits the water. These grates\r\nthey weave with silk spun from their anus into strong threads, which\r\ncross each other, and are not soluble in water. One of them, described\r\nby De Geer, is very remarkable. It consists of a small, thickish,\r\ncircular lamina of brown silk, becoming as hard as gum, which exactly\r\nfits the aperture of the case, and is fixed a little within the margin.\r\nIt is pierced all over with holes disposed in concentric circles, and\r\nseparated by ridges which go from the centre to the circumference, but\r\noften not quite so regularly as the radii of a circle or the spokes of\r\na wheel. These radii are traversed again by other ridges, which follow\r\nthe direction of the circles of holes; so that the two kinds of ridges\r\ncrossing each other form compartments, in the centre of each of which\r\nis a hole[392].\r\n\r\nUnder this head I shall call your attention to another circumstance\r\nthat saves from their enemies innumerable insects:--I mean their coming\r\nforth for flight or for food only in the night, and taking their\r\nrepose in various places of concealment during the day. The infinite\r\nhosts of moths (_Phalæna_, L.),--amounting in this country to more\r\nthan a thousand species,--with few exceptions, are all night-fliers.\r\nAnd a considerable proportion of the other orders,--exclusive of the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, which are mostly day-fliers,--are of the\r\nsame description. Many _larvæ_ of moths also come out only in the night\r\nafter their food, lying hid all day in subterraneous or other retreats.\r\nOf this kind is that of _Fumea pulla_ and _Nycterobius_, whose\r\nproceedings have been before described[393]. The caterpillar of another\r\nmoth (_Noctua subterranea_, F.) never ascends the stems of plants, but\r\nremains, a true Troglodyte, always in its cell under ground, biting the\r\nstems at their base, which falling, bring thus their foliage within its\r\nreach[394].\r\n\r\nThe habitations of insects are also usually places of retreat,\r\nwhich secure them from many of their enemies:--but I have so fully\r\nenlarged upon this subject on a former occasion[395], that it would\r\nbe superfluous to do more than mention it here.\r\n\r\nI am now to lay before you some examples of the contrivances, requiring\r\nskill and ingenuity, by which our busy animals occasionally defend\r\nthemselves from the designs and attack of their foes. Of these I\r\nhave already detailed to you many instances, which I shall not here\r\nrepeat; my history therefore will not be very prolix.--I observed\r\nin my account of the societies of wasps, that they place sentinels\r\nat the mouth of their nests. The same precaution is taken by the\r\nhive-bees, particularly in the night, when they may expect that\r\nthe great destroyers of their combs, _Galleria mellonella_ and its\r\nassociates[396], will endeavour to make their way into the hive.\r\nObserve them by moonlight, and you will see the sentinels pacing about\r\nwith their antennæ extended, and alternately directed to the right\r\nand left. In the mean time the moths flutter round the entrance; and\r\nit is curious to see with what art they know how to profit of the\r\ndisadvantage that the bees, which cannot discern objects but in a\r\nstrong light, labour under at that time. But should they touch a moth\r\nwith these organs of nice sensation, it falls an immediate victim\r\nto their just anger. The moth, however, seeks to glide between the\r\nsentinels, avoiding with the utmost caution, as if she were sensible\r\nthat her safety depended upon it, all contact with their antennæ. These\r\nbees upon guard in the night, are frequently heard to utter a very\r\nshort low hum; but no sooner does any strange insect or enemy touch\r\ntheir antennæ, than the guard is put into a commotion, and the hum\r\nbecomes louder, resembling that of bees when they fly, and the enemy is\r\nassailed by workers from the interior of the hive[397].\r\n\r\nTo defend themselves from the death's-head hawk-moth, they have\r\nrecourse to a different proceeding. In seasons in which they are\r\nannoyed by this animal, they often barricade the entrance of their\r\nhive by a thick wall made of wax and propolis. This wall is built\r\nimmediately behind and sometimes in the gateway, which it entirely\r\nstops up; but it is itself pierced with an opening or two sufficient\r\nfor the passage of one or two workers. These fortifications are\r\noccasionally varied: sometimes there is only one wall, as just\r\ndescribed, the apertures of which are in arcades, and placed in\r\nthe upper part of the masonry. At others many little bastions, one\r\nbehind the other, are erected. Gateways masked by the anterior\r\nwalls, and not corresponding with those in them, are made in the\r\nsecond line of building. These casemated gates are not constructed\r\nby the bees without the most urgent necessity. When their danger\r\nis present and pressing, and they are as it were compelled to seek\r\nsome preservative, they have recourse to this mode of defence[398],\r\nwhich places the instinct of these animals in a wonderful light,\r\nand shows how well they know how to adapt their proceedings to\r\ncircumstances. Can this be merely sensitive? When attacked by strange\r\nbees, they have recourse to a similar manœuvre; only in this case\r\nthey make but narrow apertures, sufficient for a single bee to pass\r\nthrough.--Pliny affirms that a sick bear will provoke a hive of bees\r\nto attack him in order to let him blood[399]. What will you say, if\r\nhumble-bees have recourse to a similar manœuvre? It is related to\r\nme by Dr. Leach, from the communications of Mr. Daniel Bydder--an\r\nindefatigable and well-informed collector of insects, and observer of\r\ntheir proceedings--that _Bombus_[400] _terrestris_, when labouring\r\nunder _Acariasis_[401] from the numbers of a small mite (_Gamasus\r\nGymnopterorum_) that infest it, will take its station in an ant-hill;\r\nwhere beginning to scratch, and kick, and make a disturbance, the\r\nants immediately come out to attack it, and falling foul of the\r\nmites, they destroy or carry them all off; when the bee, thus\r\ndelivered from its enemies, takes its flight.\r\n\r\nIn this long detail, the first idea that will, I should hope, strike\r\nthe mind of every thinking being, is the truth of the Psalmist's\r\nobservation--that the tender mercies of God are over all his works.\r\nNot the least and most insignificant of his creatures is, we see,\r\ndeprived of his paternal care and attention; none are exiled from his\r\nall-directing providence. Why then should man, the head of the visible\r\ncreation, for whom all the inferior animals were created and endowed;\r\nfor whose well-being, in some sense, all these wonderful creatures with\r\ntheir miraculous instincts, whose history I am giving you, were put in\r\naction,--why should he ever doubt, if he uses his powers and faculties\r\nrightly, that his Creator will provide him with what is necessary for\r\nhis present state?--Why should he imagine that a Being, whose very\r\nessence is LOVE, unless he compels him by his own wilful and obdurate\r\nwickedness, will ever cut him off from his care and providence?\r\n\r\nAnother idea that upon this occasion must force itself into our mind\r\nis, that nothing is made in vain. When we find that so many seemingly\r\ntrivial variations in the colour, clothing, form, structure, motions,\r\nhabits, and economy of insects are of very great importance to them,\r\nwe may safely conclude that the peculiarities in all these respects,\r\nof which we do not yet know the use, are equally necessary: and we\r\nmay almost say, reversing the words of our Saviour, that not a _hair_\r\nis given to them without our Heavenly Father.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[289] Fabr. _Vorlesungen_, 321.\r\n\r\n[290] _Cimic.

These shall be the subject of the present\r\nletter. I shall not, however, confine myself to those by which\r\nthey seek to escape from their enemies; but take a larger and more\r\ncomprehensive survey of them, including not only every species of\r\nlocomotion, but also the movements they give to different parts of\r\ntheir body when in a state of repose: and in order to render this\r\nsurvey more complete, I shall add to it some account of the various\r\norgans and instruments by which they move.\r\n\r\nWhenever you go abroad in summer, wherever you turn your eyes and\r\nattention, you will see insects in motion. They are flying or sailing\r\nevery where in the air; dancing in the sun or in the shade; creeping\r\nslowly, or marching soberly, or running swiftly, or jumping upon the\r\nground; traversing your path in all directions; coursing over the\r\nsurface of the waters, or swimming at every depth beneath; emerging\r\nfrom a subterranean habitation, or going into one; climbing up the\r\ntrees, or descending from them; glancing from flower to flower; now\r\nalighting upon the earth and waters, and now leaving them to follow\r\nthe impulse of their various instincts; sometimes travelling singly;\r\nat other times in countless swarms: these the busy children of the\r\nday, and those of the night. If you return to your apartment--there\r\nare these ubiquitaries--some flying about--others pacing against\r\ngravity up the walls or upon the ceiling--others walking with ease\r\nupon the glass of your windows, and some even venturing to take their\r\nstation on your own sacred person, and asserting their right to the\r\nlord of the creation.\r\n\r\nThis universal movement and action of these restless little animals\r\ngives life to every part and portion of our globe, rendering even\r\nthe most arid desert interesting. From their visitations every leaf\r\nand flower becomes animated; the very dust seems to quicken into\r\nlife, and the stones, like those thrown by Deucalion and Pyrrha, to\r\nbe metamorphosed into locomotive beings. In the variety of motions\r\nwhich they exhibit, we see, as Cuvier remarks[402], those of every\r\nother description of animals. They walk, run, and jump with the\r\nquadrupeds; they fly with the birds; they glide with the serpents;\r\nand they swim with the fish. And the provision made for these motions\r\nin the structure of their bodies is most wonderful and various. \"If\r\nI was minded to expatiate,\" says the excellent Derham, \"I might\r\ntake notice of the admirable mechanism in those that creep; the\r\ncurious oars in those amphibious insects that swim and walk; the\r\nincomparable provision made in the feet of such as walk or hang upon\r\nsmooth surfaces; the great strength and spring in the legs of such\r\nas leap; the strong-made feet and talons of such as dig; and, to\r\nname no more, the admirable faculty of such as cannot fly, to convey\r\nthemselves with speed and safety, by the help of their webs, or some\r\nother artifice, to make their bodies lighter than the air[403].\"\r\n\r\nSince the motions, and instruments of motion, of insects are usually\r\nvery different in their preparatory states, from what they are in the\r\nimago or perfect state, I shall therefore consider them separately,\r\nand divide my subject into--motions of larvæ,--motions of pupæ,--and\r\nmotions of perfect insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Amongst _larvæ_ there are two classes of movers--_Apodous_ larvæ,\r\nor those that move without legs,--and _Pedate_ larvæ, or those that\r\nmove by means of legs. I must here observe, that by the term _legs_,\r\nwhich I use strictly, I mean only jointed organs, that have free\r\nmotion, and can walk or step alternately; not those spurious legs\r\nwithout joints, that have no free motion, and cannot walk or take\r\nalternate steps; such as support the middle and anus of the larvæ of\r\nmost _Lepidoptera_ and saw-flies (_Serrifera_).\r\n\r\n_Apodous_ larvæ seldom have occasion to take long journeys; and many\r\nof them, except when about to assume the pupa, only want to change\r\ntheir place or posture, and to follow their food in the substance,\r\nwhether animal or vegetable, to which, when included in the egg, the\r\nparent insect committed them. Legs therefore would be of no great\r\nuse to them, and to these last a considerable impediment. They are\r\ncapable of three kinds of motion;--they either walk, or jump, or\r\nswim. I use _walking_ in an improper sense, for want of a better term\r\nequally comprehensive: for some may be said to move by gliding; and\r\nothers (I mean those that, fixing the head to any point, bring the\r\ntail up to it, and so proceed) by stepping.\r\n\r\nThe motion of serpents was ascribed by some of the ancients (who were\r\nunable to conceive that it could be effected naturally, unless by\r\nthe aid of legs, wings, or fins,) to a preternatural cause. It was\r\nsupposed to resemble the \"_incessus deorum_,\" and procured to these\r\nanimals, amongst other causes, one of the highest and most honourable\r\nranks in the emblematical class of their false divinities[404]. Had\r\nthey known Sir Joseph Banks's late discovery,--that some serpents\r\npush themselves along by the points of their ribs, which Sir E. Home\r\nhas found to be curiously constructed for this purpose,--their wonder\r\nwould have been diminished, and their serpent-gods undeified. But\r\nthough serpents can no longer make good their claim to motion _more\r\ndeorum_, some insects may take their places; for there are numbers of\r\nlarvæ, that having neither legs, nor ribs, nor any other points by\r\nwhich they can push themselves forward on a plane, _glide_ along by the\r\nalternate contraction and extension of the segments of their body. Had\r\nthe ancient Egyptians been aware of this, their catalogue of insect\r\ndivinities would have been wofully crowded. In this annular motion, the\r\nanimal alternately supports each segment of the body upon the plane of\r\nposition, which it is enabled to do by the little bundles of muscles\r\nattached to the skin, that take their origin within the body[405].\r\n\r\nI shall begin the list of _walkers_, the movements of which are\r\naided by various instruments, with one which is well known to most\r\npeople,--the grub of the nut-weevil (_Balaninus Nucum_). When placed\r\nupon a table, after lying some time, perhaps, bent in a bow, with its\r\nhead touching its tail, at last it begins to move, which, though in\r\nno certain direction, it does with more speed than might be expected.\r\nRösel fancied that this animal had feet furnished with claws; but\r\nin this, as De Geer justly observes, he was altogether mistaken,\r\nsince it has not the least rudiment of them, its motion being\r\nproduced solely by the alternate contraction and extension of the\r\nsegments of the body, assisted, perhaps, by the fleshy prominences\r\nof its sides.--Other larvæ have this annular motion aided by a slimy\r\nsecretion, which gives them further hold upon the plane on which they\r\nare moving, and supplies in some degree the place of legs or claws.\r\nThat of the weevil of the common figwort (_Cionus Scrophulariæ_)\r\nis always covered with slime, which enables it,--though it renders\r\nits appearance disgusting,--to walk with steadiness, by the mere\r\nlengthening and shortening of its segments, upon the leaves of that\r\nplant[406].--Of this kind also are those larvæ, mentioned above[407],\r\nreceived by De Geer from M. Ziervogel, which, adhering to each other\r\nby a slimy secretion, glide along so slowly upon the ground as to be\r\na quarter of an hour in going the breadth of the hand, whence the\r\nnatives call their bands _Gårds-drag_[408].\r\n\r\nAs a further help, others again call in the assistance of their\r\nunguiform mandibles. These, which are peculiar to grubs with a variable\r\nmembranaceous, or rather retractile, head[409], especially those of the\r\nfly tribe (_Muscidæ_), when the animal does not use them, are retracted\r\nnot only within the head, but even within the segments behind it[410];\r\nbut when it is moving they are protruded, and lay hold of the surface\r\non which it is placed. They were long ago noticed by the accurate\r\nRay. \"This blackness in the head,\" says he, speaking of the maggot of\r\nthe common flesh-fly, \"is caused by two black spines or hooks, which\r\nwhen in motion it puts forth, and fixing them in the ground, so drags\r\nalong its body[411].\"--The larvæ of the aphidivorous flies (_Syrphus_,\r\n&c.), the ravages of which amongst the Aphides I have before described\r\nto you[412], transport themselves from place to place in the same\r\nway, walking by means of their teeth. Fixing their hind part to the\r\nsubstances on which they are moving, they give their body its greatest\r\npossible tension; and, if I may so speak, thus take as long a step as\r\nthey can: next, laying hold of it with their mandibles, by setting free\r\nthe tail and relaxing the tension, the former is brought near the head.\r\nThus the animal proceeds, and thus will even walk upon glass[413]. Some\r\ngrubs, as the lesser house-fly (_Anthomyia canicularis_), have only\r\none of these claw-teeth; and in some they have the form as well as the\r\noffice of legs[414]. Bonnet mentions an apodous larva, that, before\r\nit can use its mandibles, is obliged to spin, at certain intervals,\r\nlittle hillocks or steps of silk; of which it then lays hold by them,\r\nand so drags itself along.\r\n\r\nBesides their mandibular hooks, some of these grubs supply the want\r\nof legs by means of claws at their anus. Thus that of the flesh-fly,\r\nRay tells us in the place just quoted, pushes itself by the protruded\r\nspines of its tail. The larva also of a long-legged gnat (_Limnobia\r\nreplicata_), which in that state lives in the water, is furnished\r\nwith these anal claws, which, in conjunction with its annular tension\r\nand relaxation, and the hooks of its mouth, assist it in walking over\r\nthe aquatic plants[415].\r\n\r\nA remarkable difference, according to their station, obtains in\r\nthe bots of gad-flies (_Œstridæ_); those that are subcutaneous\r\n(_Cuticolæ_, Clark) having no unguiform mandibles; while those\r\nthat are gastric (_Gastricolæ_, Clark), and those that inhabit the\r\nmaxillary sinuses of animals (_Cavicolæ_, Clark), are furnished with\r\nthem. In this we evidently see Creative Wisdom adapting means to\r\ntheir end. For the cuticular bots having no plane surface to move\r\nupon, and imbibing a liquid food, in them the mandibular hooks would\r\nbe superfluous. But they are furnished with other means by which\r\nthey can accomplish such motions, and in contrary directions, as are\r\nnecessary to them; the anterior part of each segment being beset with\r\nnumbers of very minute spines, not visible except under a strong\r\nmagnifier, sometimes arranged in bundles, which all look towards the\r\nanus; and the posterior part is as it were paved with similar hooks,\r\nbut smaller, which point to the head. Thus we may conceive, when the\r\nanimal wants to move forward, that it pushes itself by the first\r\nset of hooks, keeping the rest, which would otherwise impede motion\r\nin that direction, pressed close to its skin--or it may depress that\r\npart of the segment; and when it would move backwards that it employs\r\nthe second[416]. The other descriptions of bots, not being embedded\r\nin the flesh but fixed to a plane, are armed with the mandibles in\r\nquestion, by which they can not only suspend themselves in their\r\nseveral stations, but likewise, with the aid of the spines with which\r\ntheir segments also are furnished, move at their pleasure[417]. Other\r\nlarvæ of flies, as well as the bots, are furnished with spines or\r\nhooks--by which they take stronger hold--to assist them in their\r\nmotions. Those mentioned in my last letter as inhabiting the nests\r\nof humble-bees[418], besides the six radii that arm their anus, and\r\nwhich perhaps may assist them in locomotion, have the margin of their\r\nbody fringed with a double row of short spines[419], which are,\r\ndoubtless, useful in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe next order of walkers amongst apodous larvæ are those that move\r\nby means of fleshy tuberculiform or pediform prominences,--which last\r\nresemble the spurious legs of the caterpillars of most _Lepidoptera_.\r\nSome, a kind of monopods, have only one of such prominences, which\r\nbeing always fixed almost under the head, may serve, in some degree,\r\nthe purpose of an unguiform mandible. The grub of a kind of gnat\r\n(_Chironomus stercorarius_), and also another, probably of the\r\nTipularian tribe (found by De Geer in a subputrescent stalk of\r\nAngelica which he was unable to trace to the fly), have each a fleshy\r\nleg on the underside of the first segment, which points towards\r\nthe head and assists them in their motions[420].--Others again go\r\na little further, and are supported at their anterior extremity by\r\na pair of spurious legs. An aquatic larva of a most singular form,\r\nand of the same tribe, figured by Reaumur, is thus circumstanced. In\r\nthis case the processes in question proceed from the head, and are\r\narmed with claws[421]. Would you think it--another Tipularian grub\r\nis distinguished by _three_ legs of this kind? It was first noticed\r\nby De Geer under the name of _Tipula maculata_ (_Tanypus monilis_,\r\nMeig.), who gives the following account of its motions and their\r\norgans:--It is found, he observes, in the water of swampy places and\r\nin ditches, is not bigger than a horse-hair, and about a quarter of\r\nan inch in length. Its mode of swimming is like that of a serpent,\r\nwith an undulating motion of the body, and it sometimes walks at the\r\nbottom of the water and upon aquatic plants. The most remarkable\r\npart of it are its legs, called by Latreille, but it should seem\r\nimproperly, tentacula. They resemble, by their length and rigidity,\r\nwooden legs. The anterior leg is attached to the underside, but\r\ntowards the head, of the first segment of the body. It is long and\r\ncylindrical, placed perpendicularly or obliquely, according to the\r\ndifferent movements the animal gives it, and terminates in two feet,\r\narmed at their extremity by a coronet of long moveable hooks. These\r\nfeet, like the tentacula of snails, are retractile within the leg,\r\nand even within the body, so that only a little stump, as it were,\r\nremains without. The insect moves them both together, as a lame man\r\ndoes his crutches, either backwards or forwards. The two posterior\r\nlegs are placed at the anal end of the body. They are similar to\r\nthe one just described, but larger, and entirely separate from each\r\nother, being not, like them, retractile within the body, but always\r\nstiff and extended. These also are armed with hooks. In walking, this\r\nlarva uses these two legs much as the caterpillars of the moths,\r\ncalled _Geometræ_, do theirs. By the inflection of the anus it can\r\ngive them any kind of lateral movement, except that it can neither\r\nbend nor shorten them, since like a wooden leg, as I have before\r\nobserved, they always remain stiff and extended[422]. Lyonet had\r\nobserved this larva, or a species nearly related to it; but he speaks\r\nof it as having four legs, two before and two behind. Probably, when\r\nhe examined them, the common base, from which the feet are branches,\r\nwas retracted within the body[423].\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, however, in these apodous walkers the place of\r\nlegs is supplied by fleshy and often retractile mamillæ or tubercles.\r\nBy means of these and a slimy secretion, unaided by mandibular hooks,\r\nthe caterpillar of a little moth (_Apoda Testudo_,) moves from place\r\nto place[424].--A subcutaneous larva belonging to the same order, that\r\nmines the leaves of the rose, moves also by tubercular legs assisted\r\nby slime. It has eighteen homogeneous legs, with which, when removed\r\nfrom its house of concealment, it will walk well upon any surface,\r\nwhether horizontal, inclined, or even vertical[425]. But the greatest\r\nnumber of legs of this kind that distinguish any known larva, is to\r\nbe observed in that of a two-winged fly (_Syrphus Pyrastri_) that\r\ndevours the Aphides of the rose. This animal has six rows of tubercular\r\nfeet, with which it moves, each row consisting of seven, making in all\r\nforty-two[426].--The grub of the weevil of the dock (_Hypera Rumicis_)\r\nhas twenty-four tubercular legs; but, what is remarkable, the six\r\nanterior ones, being longer than the rest, seem to represent the real\r\nlegs, while the others represent the spurious ones, of lepidopterous\r\nlarvæ. These legs, however, are all fleshy tubercles, and have no\r\nclaws, the place of which is supplied by slime which covers all the\r\nunderside of the body, and hinders the animal from falling[427].\r\nAnother weevil (_Lixus paraplecticus_,) produces a grub inhabiting the\r\nwater-hemlock, which has only six tubercles that occupy the place and\r\nare representatives of the legs of the perfect insect[428].\r\n\r\nSome larvæ have these tubercles armed with claws. The maggot of a fly\r\ndescribed by De Geer (_Volucella plumata_,) has six pair of them, each\r\nof which has three long claws. This animal has a radiated anus, and\r\nseems related to those flies that live in the nests of humble-bees[429].\r\n\r\nInsects in the peculiarities of their structure, as we have seen\r\nin many instances, sometimes realize the wildest fictions of the\r\nimagination. Should a traveller tell you that he had seen a quadruped\r\nwhose legs were on its back, you would immediately conclude that\r\nhe was playing upon your credulity, and had lost that regard to\r\ntruth which ought to distinguish the narratives of persons of his\r\ndescription. What then will you say to me, when I affirm, upon\r\nthe evidence of two most unexceptionable witnesses, Reaumur and\r\nDe Geer, that there are insects which exhibit this extraordinary\r\nstructure? The grub of a little gall-fly, appearing to be _Cynips\r\nQuercus inferus_ of Linné--which inhabits a ligneous gall resembling\r\na berry to be met with on the underside of oak-leaves--was found\r\nby the former to have on its back, on the middle of each segment,\r\na retractile fleshy protuberance that resembled strikingly the\r\nspurious legs of some caterpillars. A little attention will convince\r\nany one, argues Reaumur, that the legs of insects circumstanced\r\nlike the one under consideration, if it has any, should be on its\r\nback. For this grub--inhabiting a spherical cavity, in which it\r\nlies rolled up as it were in a ring--when it wants to move, will be\r\nenabled to do so, in this hollow sphere, with much more facility, by\r\nmeans of legs on the middle of its back, than if they were in their\r\nordinary situation[430]. So wisely has Providence ordered every\r\nthing.--Another similar instance is recorded by De Geer, which indeed\r\nhad previously been noticed, though cursorily, by the illustrious\r\nFrenchman[431]. There is a little larva, he observes, to be found at\r\nall seasons of the year, the depth of winter excepted, in stagnant\r\nwaters, which keeps its body always doubled as it were in two,\r\nagainst the sides of ditches or the stalks of aquatic plants. If it\r\nis placed in a glass half full of water, it so fixes itself against\r\nthe sides of it, that its head and tail are in the water while the\r\nremainder of the body is out of it; thus assuming the form of a\r\nsiphon, the tail end being the longest. When this animal is disposed\r\nto feed, it lifts its head and places it horizontally on the surface\r\nof the water, so that it forms a right angle with the rest of the\r\nbody, which always remains in a situation perpendicular to the\r\nsurface. It then agitates, with vivacity, a couple of brushes, formed\r\nof hairs and fixed in the anterior part of the head, which producing\r\na current towards the mouth, it makes its meal of the various species\r\nof animalcula, abounding in stagnant waters, that come within the\r\nvortex thus produced. As these animals require to be firmly fixed to\r\nthe substance on which they take their station, and their back is the\r\nonly part, when they are doubled as just described, that can apply to\r\nit,--they are furnished with minute legs armed with black claws, by\r\nwhich they are enabled to adhere to it. They have ten of these legs:\r\nthe four anterior ones, which point towards the head and are distant\r\nfrom each other, are placed upon the fourth and fifth dorsal segments\r\nof the body; and the six posterior ones, which point to the anus\r\nand are so near to each other as at first to look like one leg, are\r\nplaced on the eighth, ninth, and tenth. When the animal moves, the\r\nbody continues bent, and the sixth segment, which is without feet and\r\nforms the summit of the curve, goes first[432]. De Geer named the fly\r\nit produces _Tipula amphibia_: it seems not clear, from his figure,\r\nto which of the modern genera of the _Tipulariæ_ it belongs, nor is\r\nit referred to by Meigen.\r\n\r\nI come now to the jumping apodes, and one of this description will\r\nimmediately occur to your recollection,--that I mean which revels\r\nin our richest cheeses, and produces a little black shining fly\r\n(_Tyrophaga Casei_). These maggots have long been celebrated for\r\ntheir saltatorious powers. They effect their tremendous leaps--laugh\r\nnot at the term, for they are truly so when compared with what\r\nhuman force and agility can accomplish--in nearly the same manner\r\nas salmon are stated to do when they wish to pass over a cataract,\r\nby taking their tail in their mouth, and letting it go suddenly.\r\nWhen it prepares to leap, our larva first erects itself upon its\r\nanus, and then bending itself into a circle by bringing its head to\r\nits tail, it pushes forth its unguiform mandibles, and fixes them\r\nin two cavities in its anal tubercles. All being thus prepared,\r\nit next contracts its body into an oblong, so that the two halves\r\nare parallel to each other. This done, it lets go its hold with\r\nso violent a jerk that the sound produced by its mandibles may be\r\nreadily heard, and the leap takes place. Swammerdam saw one, whose\r\nlength did not exceed the fourth part of an inch, jump in this\r\nmanner out of a box six inches deep; which is as if a man six feet\r\nhigh should raise himself in the air by jumping 144 feet! He had\r\nseen others leap a great deal higher[433]. The grub of a little gnat\r\nlately noticed (_Chironomus stercorarius_) has a similar faculty,\r\nthough executed in a manner rather different. These larvæ, which\r\ninhabit horse-dung, though deprived of feet, cannot move by annular\r\ncontraction and dilatation; but are able, by various serpentine\r\ncontortions, aided by their mandibles, to move in the substance which\r\nconstitutes their food. Should any accident remove them from it,\r\nProvidence has enabled them to recover their natural station by the\r\npower I am speaking of. When about to leap, they do not, like the\r\ncheese-fly, erect themselves so as to form an angle with the plane\r\nof position; but lying horizontally, they bring the anus near the\r\nhead, regulating the distance by the length of the leap they mean to\r\ntake; when fixing it firmly, and then suddenly resuming a rectilinear\r\nposition, they are carried through the air sometimes to the distance\r\nof two or three inches. They appear to have the power of flattening\r\ntheir anal extremity, and even of rendering it concave: by means\r\nof which it may probably act as a sucker, and so be more firmly\r\nfixable[434].--The grub of a fly whose proceedings in that state I\r\nhave before noticed[435] (_Leptis Vermileo_), will, when removed from\r\nits habitation, endeavour to recover it by leaping. Indeed this mode\r\nof motion seems often to be given to this description of larvæ by\r\nProvidence, to enable them to return to their natural station, when\r\nby any accident they have wandered away from it.\r\n\r\nMany apodous larvæ inhabit the water, and therefore must be\r\nfurnished with means of locomotion proper to that element. To this\r\nclass belongs the common gnat (_Culex pipiens_), which being one\r\nof our greatest torments, compels us to feel some curiosity about\r\nits history. Its larva is a very singular creature, furnished with\r\na remarkable anal apparatus for respiration, by which it usually\r\nremains suspended at the surface of the water. If disposed to\r\ndescend, it seems to sink by the weight of its body; but when it\r\nwould move upwards again, it effects its purpose by alternate\r\ncontortions of the upper and lower halves of it, and thus it moves\r\nwith much celerity. The laminæ or swimmers, which terminate its\r\nanus[436], are doubtless of use to it in promoting this purpose.\r\nIt does not, that I ever observed, move in a lateral direction,\r\nbut only from the surface downwards, and _vice versa_.--Another\r\ndipterous larva (_Corethra culiciformis_), which much resembles that\r\nof the gnat in form, differs from it in its motions and station of\r\nrepose. For, instead of being suspended at the surface with its head\r\ndownwards, it usually, like fishes, remains in a horizontal position\r\nin the middle of the water. When it ascends to the surface, it is\r\nalways by means of a few strokes of its tail, so that its motion is\r\nnot equable, _sed per saltus_. It descends again gradually by its\r\nown weight, and regains its equilibrium by a single stroke of the\r\ntail[437].--A well known fly (_Stratyomis Chamæleon_), in its first\r\nstate an aquatic animal, often remains suspended, by its radiated\r\nanus, at the surface of the water, with its head downwards. But when\r\nit is disposed to seek the bottom or to descend, by bending the radii\r\nof its tail so as to form a concavity, it includes in them a bubble\r\nof air, in brilliancy resembling silver or pearl; and then sinks with\r\nit by its own weight. When it would return to the surface it is by\r\nmeans of this bubble, which is, as it were, its air-balloon. If it\r\nmoves upon the surface or horizontally, it bends its body alternately\r\nto the right and left, contracting itself into the form of the letter\r\nS; and then extending itself again into a straight line, by these\r\nalternate movements it makes its way slowly in the water[438].\r\n\r\nI have dwelt longer upon the apodous larvæ, or those that are\r\nwithout what may be called proper legs, analogous to those of\r\nperfect insects, because the absence of these ordinary instruments\r\nof motion is in numbers of them supplied in a way so remarkable\r\nand so worthy to be known; and because in them the wisdom of the\r\nCreator is so conspicuously, or, I should rather say, so strikingly\r\nmanifested--since it is doubtless equally conspicuous in the ordinary\r\nroutine of nature. But aberrations from her general laws, and modes,\r\nand instruments of action, often of rare occurrence, impress us more\r\nforcibly than any thing that falls under our daily observation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI come now to _pedate_ larvæ, or those that move by means of proper\r\nor articulate legs. These legs (generally six in number, and attached\r\nto the underside of the three first segments of the body) vary in\r\nlarvæ of the different orders: but they seem in most to have joints\r\nanswering to the hip (_coxa_); trochanter; thigh (_femur_); shank\r\n(_tibia_); foot (_tarsus_), of perfect insects, the legs of which\r\nthey include. Cuvier, speaking of _Coleoptera_ and some _Neuroptera_,\r\nmentions only three joints. But many in these orders (amongst which\r\nhe included the _Trichoptera_) have the joints I have enumerated. To\r\nname no more, the _Lamellicornia_, _Dytisci_, _Silphæ_, _Staphylini_,\r\n_Cicindelæ_, and _Gyrini_, &c. amongst coleopterous larvæ; and\r\nthe _Trichoptera_, as well as the _Libellulina_ and _Ephemerina_,\r\namongst Cuvier's _Neuroptera_,--have these joints, and in many the\r\nlast terminates in a double claw[439]. In some coleopterous genera\r\nthe tarsus seems absent or obsolete. The larva of the lady-bird\r\n(_Coccinella_) affords an example of the former kind, and that of\r\n_Chrysomela_ of the latter[440]. These joints are very visible in the\r\nlegs of caterpillars of _Lepidoptera_, and their tarsus is armed with\r\na single claw[441]. The larvæ that have these legs walk with them\r\nsometimes very swiftly. In stepping they set forward at the same time\r\nthe anterior and posterior legs of one side, and the intermediate one\r\nof the other; and so alternately on each side.\r\n\r\nPedate larvæ are of two descriptions: those that to perfect legs add\r\nspurious ones with or without claws, and those that have only perfect\r\nlegs. I begin with the former--those that have both kinds of legs. But\r\nfirst I must make a few remarks upon _spurious_ legs. Because their\r\nmuscles, instead of the horny substance that protects them in perfect\r\nlegs, are covered only by a soft membrane, they have been usually\r\ndenominated _membranaceous legs_: since, however, they are temporary,\r\nvanishing altogether when the insect arrives at its perfect state,--are\r\nmerely used, for they do not otherwise assist in this motion, as props\r\nto hinder its long body, when it walks, from trailing on the ground;\r\nto push against the plane of position; and, by means of their hooks or\r\nclaws, to fix itself firmly to its station when it feeds or reposes,--I\r\nshall therefore call them prolegs (_propedes_[442]). These organs\r\nconsist of three or four folds, and are commonly terminated, though\r\nnot always, by a coronet or semicoronet of very minute crooked claws\r\nor hooks. These claws, which sometimes amount to nearly a hundred on\r\none proleg, are alternately longer and shorter. They are crooked at\r\nboth ends, and are attached to the proleg by the back by means of a\r\nmembrane, which covers about two-thirds of their length, leaving their\r\ntwo extremities naked. Of these the upper one is sharp, and the lower\r\nblunt. The sole, or part of the prolegs within the claws, is capable of\r\nopening and shutting. When the animal walks, that they may not impede\r\nits motion, it is shut, and the claws are laid flat with their points\r\ninwards; but when it wishes to fix itself, the sole is opened, becoming\r\nof greater diameter than before, and the claws stand erect with their\r\npoints outwards. Thus they can lay stronger hold of the plane of\r\nposition[443].\r\n\r\nThe number of these prolegs varies in different species and families.\r\nIn the numerous tribes of saw-flies (_Serrifera_), the larvæ of\r\nwhich resemble those of _Lepidoptera_, and are called by Reaumur\r\nspurious caterpillars (_fausses chenilles_), one family (_Lophyrus_)\r\nhas sixteen prolegs; a second (_Hylotoma_, &c.) fourteen; another\r\n(_Tenthredo_, F.) twelve; and a fourth (_Lyda_) none at all, having\r\nonly the six perfect legs. The majority of larvæ of _Lepidoptera_\r\nhave ten prolegs, eight being attached, a pair on each, to the\r\nsixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth segments of the body, and two to\r\nthe twelfth or anal segment[444]. The caterpillar of the puss-moth\r\n(_Cerura Vinula_) and some others, instead of the anal prolegs, have\r\ntwo tails or horns. A hemigeometer, described by De Geer, has only\r\nsix intermediate prolegs, the posterior pair of which are longer\r\nthan the rest, to assist the anal pair in supporting the body in\r\na posture more or less erect[445]. Other hemigeometers, of which\r\nkind is the larva of _Plusia Gamma_[446], have only six prolegs,\r\nfour intermediate and two anal. The true geometers or surveyors\r\n(_Geometræ_) have only two intermediate and two anal prolegs.\r\nMany grubs of _Coleoptera_, especially those of _Staphylinidæ_,\r\n_Silphidæ_, &c. which are long and narrow, are furnished with a stiff\r\njoint at the anus, which they bend downwards and use as a prop to\r\nprevent their body from trailing. This joint, though without claws,\r\nmay be regarded as a kind of proleg, which supports them when they\r\nwalk[447]; and probably may assist their motion by pushing against\r\nthe plane of position.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the larvæ that have only perfect legs, having just\r\ngiven you an account of these organs, I have nothing more to state\r\nrelating to their structure. I shall therefore now consider the\r\nmotions of pedate larvæ, under the several heads of walking or\r\nrunning, jumping, climbing, and swimming.\r\n\r\nAmongst those that _walk_, some are remarkable for the slowness of\r\ntheir motion, while others are extremely swift. The caterpillar of\r\nthe hawk-moth of the Filipendula (_Zygæna Filipendulæ_) is of the\r\nformer description, moving in the most leisurely manner; while that\r\nof _Apatela leporina_, a moth unknown in Britain, is named after the\r\nhare, from its great speed. The caterpillar of another moth, the\r\nspecies of which seems not to be ascertained, is celebrated by De\r\nGeer for the wonderful celerity of its motions. When touched it darts\r\naway backwards as well as forwards, giving its body an undulating\r\nmotion with such force and rapidity, that it seems to fly from side\r\nto side[448].--Cuvier observes, that the grubs of some coleopterous\r\nand neuropterous insects, which have only the six perfect legs,\r\nby means of them lay hold of any surrounding object, and, fixing\r\nthemselves to it, drag the rest of their body to that point; and that\r\nthose of many capricorn beetles and their affinities (but that of\r\n_Callidium violaceum_ is an apode[449]) have these legs excessively\r\nminute and almost nothing; that they move in the sinuosities which\r\nthey bore by the assistance of their mandibles, with which they fix\r\nthemselves, and also of several dorsal and ventral tubercles, by\r\nwhich they are supported against the sides of their cavity, and push\r\nthemselves along, in the same manner as a chimney-sweeper--by the\r\npressure of his knees, elbows, shoulder-blades, and other prominent\r\nparts--pushes himself up a chimney[450]. The larva of the ant-lion\r\n(_Myrmeleon_)--with the exception of one species, which moves in the\r\ncommon way--always walks backwards, even when its legs are cut off.\r\n\r\nThe _jumpers_ amongst pedate larvæ, as far as they are known, are not\r\nvery numerous, and will not detain you long. When the caterpillar of\r\n_Lithosia Quadra_, a moth not uncommon, would descend from one branch\r\nor leap to another, it approaches to the edge of the leaf on which\r\nit is stationed, bends its body together, and retiring a little\r\nbackwards, as if to take a good situation, leaps through the air,\r\nand, however high the jump, alights on its legs like a cat. That of\r\nanother moth (_Herminia rostralis_) will also leap to a considerable\r\nheight[451].\r\n\r\nAnother species of motion, which is peculiar to larvæ,--their mode I\r\nmean of _climbing_,--as it merits particular attention, will occupy\r\nmore time. I have already related so many extraordinary facts in their\r\nhistory, that I promise myself you will not disbelieve me if I assert\r\nthat insects either use ladders for this purpose, or a single rope. You\r\nmay often have seen the caterpillar of the common cabbage-butterfly\r\nclimbing up the walls of your house, and even over the glass of your\r\nwindows. When next you witness this last circumstance, if you observe\r\nclosely the square upon which the animal is travelling, you will find\r\nthat, like a snail, it leaves a visible track behind it. Examine this\r\nwith your microscope, and you will see that it consists of little\r\nsilken threads, which it has spun in a zigzag direction, forming a\r\nrope-ladder, by which it ascends a surface it could not otherwise\r\nadhere to. The silk as it comes from the spinners is a gummy fluid,\r\nwhich hardens in the air; so that it has no difficulty in making\r\nit stick to the glass.--Many caterpillars that feed upon trees,\r\nparticularly the geometers, have often occasion to descend from branch\r\nto branch, and sometimes, especially previously to assuming the pupa,\r\nto the ground. Had they to descend by the trunk, supposing them able\r\nto traverse with ease its rugged bark, what a circuitous route must\r\nthey take before they could accomplish their purpose! Providence, ever\r\nwatchful over the welfare of the most insignificant of its creatures,\r\nhas gifted them with the means of attaining these ends, without all\r\nthis labour and loss of time. From their own internal stores they can\r\nlet down a rope, and prolong it indefinitely, which will enable them to\r\ntravel where they please. Shake the branches of an oak or other tree\r\nin summer, and its inhabitants of this description, whether they were\r\nreposing, moving, or feeding, will immediately cast themselves from the\r\nleaves on which they were stationed; and however sudden your attack,\r\nthey are nevertheless still provided for it, and will all descend\r\nby means of the silken cord just alluded to, and hang suspended in\r\nthe air. Their name of geometer was given them, because they seem to\r\nmeasure the surface they pass over, as they walk, with a chain. If you\r\nplace one upon your hand, you will find that they draw a thread as they\r\ngo; when they move, their head is extended as far as they can reach\r\nwith it; then fastening their thread there, and bringing up the rest of\r\ntheir body, they take another step; never moving without leaving this\r\nclue behind them; the object of which, however, is neither to measure,\r\nnor to mark its path that it may find it again; but thus, whenever the\r\ncaterpillar falls or would descend from a leaf, it has a cord always\r\nready to support it in the air, by lengthening which it can with ease\r\nreach the ground. Thus it can drop itself without danger from the\r\nsummit of the most lofty trees, and ascend again by the same road. As\r\nthe silky matter is fluid when it issues from the spinners, it should\r\nseem as if the weight of the insect would be too great, and its descent\r\ntoo rapid, so as to cause it to fall with violence upon the earth. The\r\nlittle animal knows how to prevent such an accident, by descending\r\ngradually. It drops itself a foot or half a foot, or even less, at\r\na time; then making a longer or shorter pause, as best suits it, it\r\nreaches the ground at last without a shock. From hence it appears that\r\nthese larvæ have power to contract the orifice of the spinners, so as\r\nthat no more of the silky gum shall issue from it; and to relax it\r\nagain when they intend to resume their motion downwards: consequently\r\nthere must be a muscular apparatus to enable them to effect this, or at\r\nleast a kind of sphincter, which, pressing the silk, can prevent its\r\nexit. From hence also it appears that the gummy fluid which forms the\r\nthread must have gained a degree of consistence even before it leaves\r\nthe spinner, since as soon as it emerges it can support the weight of\r\nthe caterpillar.--In ascending, the animal seizes the thread with its\r\njaws as high as it can reach it; and then elevating that part of the\r\nback that corresponds with the six perfect legs, till these legs become\r\nhigher than the head, with one of the last pair it catches the thread;\r\nfrom this the other receives it, and so a step is gained: and thus\r\nit proceeds till it has ascended to the point it wishes to reach. At\r\nthis time if taken it will be found to have a packet of thread, from\r\nwhich, however, it soon disengages itself; between the two last pairs\r\nof perfect legs[452]. To see hundreds of these little animals pendent\r\nat the same time from the boughs of a tree, suspended at different\r\nheights, some working their way downwards and some upwards, affords\r\na very amusing spectacle. Sometimes, when the wind is high, they are\r\nblown to the distance of several yards from the tree, and yet maintain\r\ntheir threads unbroken. I witnessed an instance of this last summer,\r\nwhen numbers were driven far from the most extended branches, and\r\nlooked as if they were floating in the air.\r\n\r\nHaving related to you what is peculiar in the motions of pedate\r\nlarvæ upon the earth and in the air, I must next say something\r\nwith respect to their locomotive powers in the _water_. Numbers of\r\nthis description inhabit that element.--Amongst the beetles, the\r\ngenera _Dytiscus_, _Hydrophilus_, _Gyrinus_, _Limnius_, _Parnus_,\r\n_Heterocerus_, _Elophorus_, _Hydræna_, &c. amongst the bug tribes,\r\n_Gerris_, _Velia_, _Hydrometra_, _Notonecta_, _Sigara_, _Nepa_,\r\n_Ranatra_, _Naucoris_; a few _Lepidoptera_; the majority of\r\n_Trichoptera_; _Libellula_, _Aeshna_, _Agrion_, _Sialis_, _Ephemera_,\r\n&c. amongst the _Neuroptera_; _Culex_ and many of the _Tipulariæ_,\r\nLatr. from the dipterous insects; and from the _Aptera_, _Atax_, some\r\n_Poduræ_, and many of the _Oniscidæ_, &c.--All these, in their larva\r\nstate, are aquatic animals.\r\n\r\nThe motions of these creatures in this state are various. Some walk\r\non the ground under water; some move in midwater, either by the\r\nsame motion of the legs as they use in walking, or by strokes, as\r\nin swimming; others for this purpose employ certain laminæ, which\r\nterminate their tails, as oars; others again swim like fish, with an\r\nequable motion; some move by the force of the water which they spirt\r\nfrom their anus; others again swim about in cases, or crawl over the\r\nsubmerged bottom; and others walk even on the surface of the water. I\r\nshall not now enlarge on all these kinds of water-motion, since many\r\nwill come under consideration hereafter.\r\n\r\nThere are two descriptions of larvæ of _Hydrophili_, one furnished\r\nwith swimmers or anal appendages, by means of which they are enabled\r\nto swim; the other have them not, and hence are not able to rise from\r\nthe bottom[453]. The larvæ of _Dytisci_, by means of these natatory\r\norgans, will swim, though slowly, and every now and then rise to the\r\nsurface for the sake of respiration. Those of _Ephemeræ_, when they\r\nswim, apply their legs to the body, and swim with the swiftness and\r\nmotions of fish[454]. Those of the true may-fly (_Sialis lutaria_),\r\non the contrary, use their legs in swimming, and at the same time,\r\nby alternate inflexions, give to their bodies the undulations of\r\nserpents[455]. But the larvæ of certain dragon-flies (_Aeshna_ and\r\n_Libellula_,) will afford you the most amusement by their motions.\r\nThese larvæ commonly swim very little, being generally found walking\r\nat the bottom on aquatic plants: when necessary, however, they can\r\nswim well, though in a singular manner. If you see one swimming, you\r\nwill find that the body is pushed forward by strokes, between which\r\nan interval takes place. The legs are not employed in producing this\r\nprogressive motion, for they are then applied close to the sides of\r\nthe trunk, in a state of perfect inaction. But it is effected by a\r\nstrong ejaculation of water from the anus. When I treat upon the\r\nrespiration of insects, I shall explain to you the apparatus by which\r\nthese animals separate the air from the water for that purpose; in\r\nthe present case it is subsidiary to their motions, since it is by\r\ndrawing in and then expelling the water that they are enabled to\r\nswim. To see this, you have only to put one of these larvæ into a\r\nplate with a little water. You will find that, while the animal\r\nmoves forward, a current of water is produced by this pumping, in\r\na contrary direction. As the larva, between every stroke of its\r\ninternal piston, has to draw in a fresh supply of water, an interval\r\nmust of course take place between the strokes. Sometimes it will lift\r\nits anus out of the water, when a long thread of water, if I may so\r\nspeak, issues from it[456].\r\n\r\n\r\nII. I am next to say something upon the motions of insects in their\r\n_pupa_ state. This is usually to our little favourites a state of\r\nperfect repose; but, as I long since observed[457], there are several\r\nthat, even when become pupæ, are as active and feed as rapaciously\r\nas they do when they are either larvæ or perfect insects. The\r\n_Dermaptera_, _Orthoptera_, _Hemiptera_, many of the _Neuroptera_,\r\nand the majority of the _Aptera_, are of this description. With\r\nrespect to their motions, we may therefore consider pupæ as of two\r\nkinds--_active_ pupæ, and _quiescent_ pupæ.\r\n\r\nThe motions of most insects whose pupæ are _active_, are so similar\r\nin all their states, except where the wings are concerned, as not\r\nto need any separate account. I shall therefore request you to wait\r\nfor what I have to say upon them, till I enter upon those of the\r\nimago. One insect, however, of this kind, moving differently in its\r\npreparatory states, is entitled to notice under the present head.--In\r\na late letter, I mentioned to you a bug (_Reduvius personatus_) which\r\nusually covers itself with a mask of dust, and fragments of various\r\nkinds, cutting a very grotesque figure[458]. Its awkward motions add\r\nnot a little to the effect of its appearance. When so disposed, it can\r\nmove as well and as fast as its congeners; yet this does not usually\r\nanswer its purpose, which is to assume the appearance of an inanimate\r\nsubstance. It therefore hitches along in the most leisurely manner\r\npossible, as if it was counting its steps. Having set one foot forward\r\n(for it moves only one leg at a time), it stops a little before it\r\nbrings up its fellow, and so on with the second and third legs. It\r\nmoves its antennæ in a similar way, striking, as it were, first with\r\none, and then, after an interval of repose, with the other[459].--The\r\npupæ of gnats also, as well as those of many other aquatic _Diptera_,\r\nretain their locomotive powers, not however the free motion of their\r\nlimbs. When not engaged in action, they ascend to the surface by the\r\nnatural levity of their bodies, and are there suspended by two auriform\r\nrespiratory organs in the anterior part of the trunk, their abdomen\r\nbeing then folded under the breast; when disposed to descend the animal\r\nunfolds it, and by sudden strokes which she gives with it and her anal\r\nswimmers to the water, she swims, to the right and left as well as\r\ndownwards, with as much ease as the larva[460].\r\n\r\nBonnet mentions a pupa which climbs up and down in its cocoon,--and\r\nthat of the common glow-worm (_Lampyris noctiluca_) will sometimes\r\npush itself along by the alternate extension and contraction of the\r\nsegments of its body[461].--Others turn round when disturbed. That\r\nof a weevil (_Hypera Arator_) which spins itself a beautiful cocoon\r\nlike fine gauze, and which it fixes to the stalks of the common\r\nspurrey (_Sagina arvensis_), upon my touching this stalk, whirled\r\nround several times with astonishing rapidity.--The chrysalis of a\r\nscarce moth (_Hypogymna dispar_) when touched turns round with great\r\nquickness; but, as if fearful of breaking the thread by which it is\r\nsuspended by constantly twisting it in one direction, it performs\r\nits gyrations alternately from left to right, and from right to\r\nleft[462]. Generally speaking, quiescent pupæ when disturbed show\r\nthat they have life, by giving their abdomen violent contortions.\r\n\r\nBut the most extraordinary motion of pupæ is jumping. In the year\r\n1810 I received an account from a very intelligent young lady, who\r\ncollected and studied insects with more than common ardour and ability,\r\nthat a friend had brought her a chrysalis endued with this faculty.\r\nIt was scarcely a quarter of an inch in length; of an oval form; its\r\ncolour was a semitransparent brown, with a white opake band round the\r\nmiddle. It was found attached, by one end, to the leaf of a bramble. It\r\nrepeatedly jumped out of an open pill-box that was an inch in height.\r\nWhen put into a drawer in which some other insects were impaled, it\r\nskipped from side to side, passing over their backs for nearly a\r\nquarter of an hour with surprising agility. Its mode of springing\r\nseemed to be by balancing itself upon one extremity of its case. About\r\nthe end of October one end of the case grew black, and from that time\r\nthe motion ceased; and about the middle of April, in the following\r\nyear, a very minute ichneumon made its appearance by a hole it had made\r\nat the opposite end.--Some time after I had received this history, I\r\nhappened to have occasion to look at Reaumur's Memoir upon the enemies\r\nof caterpillars, where I met with an account of a similar jumping\r\nchrysalis, if not the same. Round the nests of the caterpillar of the\r\nprocessionary moth, before noticed[463], he found numerous little\r\ncocoons suspended by a thread three or four inches long to a twig or a\r\nleaf, of a shortened oval form, and close texture, but so as the meshes\r\nmight be distinguished. These cocoons were rather transparent, of a\r\ncoffee-brown colour, and surrounded in the middle by a whitish band.\r\nWhen put into boxes or glasses, or laid on the hand, they surprised\r\nhim by leaping. Sometimes their leaps were not more than ten lines, at\r\nothers they were extended to three or four inches, both in height and\r\nlength. When the animal leaps, it suddenly changes its ordinary posture\r\n(in which the back is convex and touches the upper part of the cocoon,\r\nand the head and anus rest upon the lower), and strikes the upper part\r\nwith the head and tail, before its belly, which then becomes the convex\r\npart, touches the bottom. This occasions the cocoon to rise in the air\r\nto a height proportioned to the force of the blow. At first sight this\r\nfaculty seems of no great use to an animal that is suspended in the\r\nair; but the winds may probably sometimes place it in a different and\r\nunsuitable position, and lodge it upon a leaf or twig: in this case\r\nit has it in its power to recover its natural station. Reaumur could\r\nnot ascertain the fly that should legitimately come from this cocoon,\r\nfor different cocoons gave different flies: whence it was evident that\r\nthese ichneumons were infested by their own parasite[464]. This might\r\nbe the case with that of the lady just mentioned. Perhaps, properly\r\nspeaking, in this last instance the motions ought rather to be regarded\r\nas belonging to a larva; but as it had ceased feeding, and had inclosed\r\nitself in its cocoon, I consider it as belonging to the present head.\r\n\r\nYou may probably here feel some curiosity to be informed how the\r\nnumerous larvæ that are buried in their pupa state, either in the\r\nheart of trees, under the earth, or in the waters, effect their\r\nescape from their various prisons and become denizens of the air,\r\nespecially as you are aware that each is shrouded in a winding-sheet\r\nand cased in a coffin. In most, however, if you examine this coffin\r\nclosely, you will see RESURGAM written upon it. What I mean is this.\r\nThe _puparium_ or case of the animal is furnished with certain\r\nacute points (_adminicula_) generally single, but in some instances\r\nforked, looking towards the anus, and usually placed upon transverse\r\nridges on the back of the abdomen, but sometimes arming the sides or\r\nthe margins of the segments. By this simple contrivance, aided by\r\nnew-born vigour, when the time for its great change is arrived, the\r\nincluded prisoner of hope, if under ground, pushes itself gradually\r\nupwards, till reaching the surface its head and trunk emerge, when\r\nan opening in the latter being effected by its efforts, it escapes\r\nfrom its confinement, and once more tastes the sweets of liberty\r\nand the joys of life. Those that are inclosed in trees and spin a\r\ncocoon, are furnished with points on the head, with which they make\r\nan opening in the former. The pupa of the great goat-moth (_Cossus\r\nligniperda_) thus, by divers movements, keeps disengaging itself from\r\nthis envelope, till it arrives at a hole in the tree which it had\r\nmade when a caterpillar; when its anterior part having emerged, it\r\nstops short, and so escapes a fall that might destroy it. After some\r\nrepose, in consequence of very violent efforts, the puparium opens,\r\nand it escapes from its prison[465].\r\n\r\nThe insects of the _Trichoptera_ order, or case-worm flies are\r\n_quiescent_ when they first assume the pupa, but become locomotive\r\ntowards the close of their existence in that state. Since they\r\ninhabit the water when they become pupæ, Providence has furnished\r\nthem with the means of quitting that fluid without injury, when they\r\nare to exchange it for the air; which in their winged state is their\r\nproper sphere of action. I have before described to you the grates\r\nwhich shut up their cases when they became quiescent[466]; if they\r\nhad no means of piercing these grates, they would perish in the\r\nwaters. The head of these pupæ is provided at first with a particular\r\ninstrument, which enables them to effect this purpose; its anterior\r\npart is armed with a pair of hooks in form resembling the beak of a\r\nbird; and with this, previously to their last change, they make an\r\nopening in the grate which, though it once defended, now confines\r\nthem. But at this moment, perhaps, the insect has a considerable\r\nspace of water to rise through before she can reach the surface. This\r\nis all wisely provided for; before she leaves the envelope which\r\ncovers her body, she emerges from the water, and fixes herself upon\r\nsome plant or other object, the summit of which is not overflowed.\r\nBut you will here, perhaps, ask--How can a pupa in her envelope,\r\nwith all her limbs set fast, do this? This affords another instance\r\nof the wise provision of the beneficent Father of the universe for\r\nthe welfare of his creatures. The antennæ and legs of this tribe of\r\ninsects, when they are pupæ, are not included, as is the case with\r\nmost that are quiescent in that state, in the general envelope; but\r\neach in a separate one, so as to allow it free motion. Thus the\r\ninsect when the time is come for its last change can use them (except\r\nthe hind-legs, which being partly covered by the wing-cases remain\r\nwithout motion) with ease. It then stretches out its antennæ, and\r\nsteering with its legs makes for the surface. De Geer saw one just\r\nescaped from its case run and swim with surprising agility over the\r\nbottom of a saucer, in which he had put some cases of these flies;\r\nand at last when he held a piece of stick to it, it got upon it, and\r\nhaving emerged from the water, prepared to cast its envelope. It is\r\nremarkable, that the envelope of the intermediate tarsi, like the\r\nposterior ones of Dytisci, is fringed on one side with hairs, to\r\nenable the insects to use them as swimming feet[467], while those\r\nneither of the larva nor imago are so circumstanced.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[402] _Anatom.

The motions of insects in their perfect or _imago_ state are\r\nvarious, and for various purposes; and the provision of organs\r\nby which they are enabled to effect them is equally diversified\r\nand wonderful. It will be convenient to divide this multifarious\r\nsubject; I shall therefore consider their motions under two principal\r\nheads:--motions of insects _reposing_--and motions of insects _in\r\naction_;--and this last head I shall further subdivide into motions\r\nwhose object is change of place, and sportive motions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first of these, motions of insects _reposing_, will not detain\r\nus long. The most remarkable is that of the long-legged gnats or\r\ncrane-flies (_Tipulæ_).--When at rest upon any wall or ceiling,\r\nsometimes standing upon four legs, and sometimes upon five, you\r\nmay observe them elevate and depress their body alternately. This\r\noscillating movement is produced by the weight of their body and the\r\nelasticity of their legs, and is constant and uninterrupted during\r\ntheir repose. Unless it be connected with the respiration of the\r\nanimal, it is not easy to say what is the object of it. Moths, when\r\nfeeling the stimulus of desire, or under alarm, set their whole\r\nbody into a tremor[468]. A living specimen of the hawk-moth of the\r\nwillow being once brought me, upon placing it upon my hand, after\r\nejecting a milky fluid from its anus, it put its wings and body into\r\na most rapid vibration, which continued more than a minute, when it\r\nflew away. A butterfly, called by Aurelians \"The large skipper,\"\r\n(_Hesperia Sylvanus_,) when it alights, which it does very often,\r\nfor they are never long on the wing, always turns half-way round; so\r\nthat, if it settles with its head from you, it turns it towards you.\r\n\r\nOthers of the motions in question are merely those of parts.\r\nButterflies, when standing still in the sun, as you have doubtless\r\noften observed,\r\n\r\n          \"Their golden pinions ope and close;\"\r\n\r\nthus, it should seem, unless this motion be connected with their\r\nrespiration, alternately warming and cooling their bodies. You have\r\nprobably noticed a very common little fly, of a shining black, with\r\na black spot at the end of its wings (_Seioptera vibrans_[469]).\r\nIt has received its trivial name (_vibrans_) from the constant\r\nvibration which, when reposing, it imparts to its wings. This\r\nmotion also, I have reason to think, assists its respiration.--Some\r\ninsects when awake are very active with their antennæ, though their\r\nbodies are at rest. I remember one evening attending for some time\r\nto the proceedings of one of those caseworm-flies (_Leptocerus_),\r\nthat are remarkable, like certain moths, for their long antennæ. It\r\nwas perched upon a blade of grass, and kept moving these organs,\r\nwhich were twice as long as itself, in all directions, as if by\r\nmeans of them it was exploring every thing that occurred in its\r\nvicinity.--Many Tipulæ, and likewise some mites (_Acarus vibrans_\r\nand _Gamasus motatorius_), distinguished by long anterior legs, from\r\nthis circumstance denominated _pedes motatorii_ by Linné, holding\r\nthem up in the air impart to them a vibratory motion, resembling that\r\nof the antennæ of some insects[470].--I scarcely need mention, what\r\nmust often have attracted your attention, the actions of flies when\r\nthey clean themselves; how busily they rub and wipe their head and\r\nthorax with their fore legs, and their wings and abdomen with their\r\nhind ones.--Perhaps you are not equally aware of the use to which the\r\nrove-beetles (_Staphylinus_, L.) put their long abdomen. They turn it\r\nover their back not only to put themselves in a threatening attitude,\r\nas I lately related[471], but also to fold up their wings with it,\r\nand pack them under their short elytra.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith respect to the motions of insects in _action_, they may be\r\nsubdivided, as was just observed, into motions whose object is change\r\nof place--and sportive motions.\r\n\r\nThe _locomotions_ of these animals are walking, running, jumping,\r\nclimbing, flying, swimming, and burrowing. I begin with the _walkers_.\r\n\r\nThe mode of their _walking_ depends upon the number and kind of their\r\nlegs. With regard to these, insects may be divided into four natural\r\nclasses; viz. _Hexapods_, or those that have only _six_ legs: such\r\nare those of every order except the _Aptera_ of Linné, of which only\r\nthree or four genera belong to this class.--_Octopods_, or those\r\nthat have _eight_ legs, including the tribes of mites (_Acarina_);\r\nspiders (_Araneidæ_); long-legged spiders (_Phalangidæ_); and\r\nscorpions (_Scorpionidæ_):--_Polypods_, or those that have _fourteen_\r\nlegs, consisting of the woodlouse tribe (_Oniscidæ_);--and\r\n_Myriapods_, or those that have more than fourteen legs--often\r\nmore than a hundred--composed of the two tribes of centipedes\r\n(_Scolopendridæ_) and millepedes (_Julidæ_). The first of these\r\nclasses may be denominated _proper_, and the rest _improper_ insects.\r\nThe legs of all seem to consist of the same general parts; the hip,\r\ntrochanter, thigh, shank, and foot; the four first being usually\r\nwithout joints (though in the _Araneidæ_, &c. the shank has two), and\r\nthe foot having from one to above forty[472].\r\n\r\nIn _walking_ and _running_, the hexapods, like the larvæ that have\r\nperfect legs, move the anterior and posterior leg of one side and the\r\nintermediate of the other alternately, as I have often witnessed.\r\nDe Geer, however, affirms that they advance each pair of legs at\r\nthe same time[473]; but this is contrary to fact, and indeed would\r\nmake their ordinary motions, instead of walking and running, a kind\r\nof canter and gallop. Whether those that have more than six feet\r\nmove in this way--which is not improbable--from the difficulty of\r\nattending at the same time to the movements of so many members, is\r\nnot easily ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe dog-tick (_Ixodes Ricinus_), if when young and active it moves in\r\nthe same way that it does when swoln to an enormous size with blood,\r\nseems to afford an exception to the mode of walking just described.\r\nIt first uses, says Ray, its two anterior legs as antennæ to feel\r\nout its way, and then fixing them, brings the next pair beyond them,\r\nwhich being also fixed, it takes a second step with the anterior,\r\nand so drags its bloated carcase along[474]. Redi observes, that\r\nwhen scorpions walk they use those remarkable comb-like processes at\r\nthe base of their posterior legs to assist them in their motions,\r\nextending them and setting them out from the body, as if they were\r\nwings: and his observation is confirmed by Amoreux, who calls them\r\nventral swimmers[475]. I have often noticed a millepede (_Julus\r\nterrestris_), frequently found under the bark of trees, and where\r\nthere is not a free circulation of air, the motions of which are\r\nworthy of attention. Observed at a little distance, it seems to\r\nglide over the surface, like a serpent, without legs; but a nearer\r\ninspection shows how its movement is accomplished. Alternate portions\r\nof its numerous legs are extended beyond the line of the body, so\r\nas to form an obtuse angle with it, while those in the intervals\r\npreserve a vertical direction. So that, as long as it keeps moving,\r\nlittle bunches of the legs are alternately in and out from one end\r\nto the other of its long body; and an amusing sight it is to see\r\nthe undulating line of motion successively beginning at the head and\r\npassing off at the tail.--The motion of centipedes (_Scolopendra_),\r\nas well as that of this insect and its congeners, is retrogressive as\r\nwell as progressive. Put your finger to the common one (_Lithobius\r\nforficatus_), and it will immediately retrograde, and with the same\r\nfacility as if it was going forwards. This difference, however, is\r\nthen observable--it uses its four hind legs, which, when it moves in\r\nthe usual way, are dragged after it. Almost all the other apterous\r\ninsects, as well as many of those in the other orders, can move\r\nin all directions; backwards, and towards both sides, as well as\r\nforwards. Bonnet mentions a spider (not a spinner) that always walked\r\nbackwards when it attacked a large insect of its own tribe; but when\r\nit had succeeded in driving it from a captive fly, which however it\r\ndid not eat, it walked forwards in the ordinary way[476].\r\n\r\nInsects vary much in their walking paces: some crawling along; others\r\nwalking slowly; and others moving with a very quick step. The field\r\ncricket (_Gryllus campestris_) creeps very slowly--the bloody-nose\r\nbeetle (_Timarcha tenebricosa_) and the oil-beetle (_Meloe\r\nProscarabæus_) march very leisurely; the spider-wasps (_Pompilus_)\r\nwalk by starts, as it were, vibrating their wings, at the same time,\r\nwithout expanding them; while flies, ichneumons, wasps, &c., and many\r\nbeetles, walk as fast as they can. One insect, a kind of snake-fly\r\n(_Mantispa pagana_), is said to walk upon its knees. The crane-flies\r\n(_Tipula oleracea_) and shepherd-spiders (_Phalangium_) have legs so\r\ndisproportionately long, that they seem to walk upon stilts; but\r\nwhen we consider that they have to walk over and amongst grass,--the\r\nformer laying its eggs in meadows,--we shall see the reason of this\r\nconformation. Insects do not always walk in a right line; for I have\r\noften observed the little midges (_Psychoda_, Latr.), when walking up\r\nglass, moving alternately from right to left and from left to right,\r\nas humble-bees fly, so as to describe small zigzags.\r\n\r\nNumerous are the insects that _run_. Almost all the predaceous\r\ntribes, the black dors, clocks, or ground-beetles (_Eutrechina_), and\r\ntheir fellow destroyers the _Cicindelæ_, and other _Eupterina_--which\r\nLinné, with much propriety, has denominated the tigers of the\r\ninsect world,--are gifted with uncommon powers of motion, and run\r\nwith great rapidity. The velocity, in this respect, of ants is also\r\nvery great.--Mr. Delisle observed a fly--so minute as to be almost\r\ninvisible--which ran nearly three inches in a demi-second, and in\r\nthat space made 540 steps. Consequently it could take a thousand\r\nsteps during one pulsation of the blood of a man in health[477].\r\nWhich is as if a man, whose steps measured two feet, should run\r\nat the incredible rate of more than twenty miles in a minute! How\r\nastonishing then are the powers with which these little beings\r\nare gifted!--The forest-fly (_Hippobosca_), and its kindred genus\r\n_Ornithomyia_ parasitic upon birds, are extremely difficult to take,\r\nas I have more than once experienced, from their extreme agility.\r\nI lost one from this circumstance two years ago that I found upon\r\nthe sea-lark (_Charadrius Hiaticula_) and which appeared to be\r\nnon-descript. Another most singular insect, which though apterous is\r\nnearly related to these--I mean the louse of the bat (_Nycteribia\r\nVespertilionis_), is still more remarkable for its swiftness. Its\r\nlegs, as appears from the observations of Colonel Montague, are fixed\r\nin an unusual position on the upper side of the trunk. \"It transports\r\nitself,\" to use the words of the gentleman just mentioned, \"with such\r\ncelerity, from one part of the animal it inhabits to the opposite\r\nand most distant, although obstructed by the extreme thickness of\r\nthe fur, that it is not readily taken.\"----\"When two or three were\r\nput into a small phial, their agility appeared inconceivably great;\r\nfor, as their feet are incapable of fixing upon so smooth a body,\r\ntheir whole exertion was employed in laying hold of each other;\r\nand in this most curious struggle they appeared actually flying in\r\ncircles: and when the bottle was reclined, they would frequently pass\r\nfrom one end to the other with astonishing velocity, accompanied by\r\nthe same gyrations: if by accident they escaped each other, they\r\nvery soon became motionless: and as quickly were the whole put in\r\nmotion again by the least touch of the bottle, or the movement of an\r\nindividual[478].\"--Incredibly great also is the rapidity with which\r\na little reddish mite, with two black dots on the anterior part of\r\nits back (_Gamasus Baccarum_), common upon strawberries, moves along.\r\nSuch is the velocity with which it runs, that it appears rather to\r\nglide or fly than to use its legs.\r\n\r\nWhen insects walk or run, their legs are not the only members that\r\nare put in motion. They will not, or rather cannot, stir a step till\r\ntheir antennæ are removed from their station of repose and set in\r\naction. When the chafers or petalocerous beetles are about to move,\r\nthese organs, before concealed, instantly appear, and the laminæ which\r\nterminate them being separated from each other as widely as possible,\r\nthey begin their march. They employ their antennæ, however, not as\r\nfeelers to explore surrounding objects,--their palpi being rather used\r\nfor that purpose,--but, it should seem, merely to receive vibrations,\r\nor impressions from the atmosphere, to which these laminæ, especially\r\nin the male cockchafers, or rather tree-chafers (_Melolonthæ_) present\r\na considerable surface. Yet insects that have filiform or setaceous\r\nantennæ appear often to use them for exploring. When the turnip-flea\r\n(_Haltica oleracea_) walks, its antennæ are alternately elevated and\r\ndepressed.--The same thing takes place with some woodlice (_Oniscidæ_),\r\nwhich use them as tactors, touching the surface on each side with them,\r\nas they go along. This is not however constantly the use of this kind\r\nof antennæ; for I have observed that _Telephorus lividus_,--a narrow\r\nbeetle with soft elytra, common in flowers,--when it walks vibrates\r\nits setaceous antennæ very briskly, but does not explore the surface\r\nwith them. The parasitic tribes of _Hymenoptera_, especially the minute\r\nones, when they move vibrate these organs most intensely, and probably\r\nby them discover the insect to which the law of their nature ordains\r\nthat they should commit their eggs; some even using them to explore\r\nthe deep holes in which a grub, the appropriate food of their larva,\r\nlurks[479]. But upon this subject I shall have occasion to enlarge when\r\nI treat of the senses of insects.--Antennæ are sometimes used as legs.\r\nA gnat-like kind of bug (_Ploiera vagabunda_) has very short anterior\r\nlegs, or rather arms; while the two posterior pair are very long. Its\r\nantennæ also are long. When it walks, which it does very slowly, with\r\na solemn measured step, its fore legs, which perhaps are useful only\r\nin climbing, or to seize its prey, are applied to the body, and the\r\nantennæ being bent, their extremity, which is rather thick, is made\r\nto rest upon the surface on which the animal moves, and so supply the\r\nplace of fore-legs[480].--Mr. Curtis suspects that _Xyela pusilla_, a\r\nhymenopterous insect related to _Xiphydria_, uses its maxillary palpi\r\nas legs[481]. I have observed that mites often use the long hairs with\r\nwhich the tail of some species is furnished, to assist them in walking.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of motion with which many insects are endowed is\r\n_jumping_. This is generally the result of the sudden unbending of the\r\narticulations of the posterior legs and other organs, which before\r\nhad received more than their natural bend. This unbending impresses a\r\nviolent rotatory motion upon these parts, the impulse of which being\r\ncommunicated to the centre of gravity, causes the animal to spring\r\ninto the air with a determinate velocity, opposed to its weight more\r\nor less directly[482]. Various are the organs by which these creatures\r\nare enabled to effect this motion. The majority do it by a peculiar\r\nconformation of the hind legs; others, by a pectoral process; and\r\nothers, again, by means of certain elastic appendages to the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe _hind legs_ of many beetles are furnished with remarkably large\r\nand thick thighs. Of this description are several species of weevils;\r\nfor instance, _Orchestes_ and _Ramphus_; the whole tribe of skippers\r\n(_Haltica_), and the splendid Asiatic tribe of _Sagra_[483], &c. The\r\nobject of these disproportioned and clumsy thighs is to allow space\r\nfor more powerful muscles, by which the tibiæ, when the legs are\r\nunbent, are impelled with greater force. In the _Orthoptera_ order\r\nall the grasshoppers, including the genera _Gryllotalpa_; _Gryllus_;\r\n_Tridactylus_; _Locusta_; _Acrida_; _Pterophylla_; _Pneumora_;\r\n_Truxalis_; _Acrydium_; _Tetrix_, &c.--are distinguished by incrassated\r\nposterior thighs; which however are much longer, more tapering and\r\nshapely, (they are indeed somewhat clumsy in the two first genera, the\r\ncrickets,) than those of most of the _Coleoptera_ that are furnished\r\nwith them. When disposed to leap, these insects bend their hind leg\r\nso as to bring the shank into close contact with the thigh--which has\r\noften a longitudinal furrow armed with a row of spines on each side\r\nto receive it. The leg being thus bent, they suddenly unbend it with\r\na jerk, when pushing against the plane of position, they spring into\r\nthe air often to a considerable height and distance. A locust, which\r\nhowever is aided by its wings, it is said will leap two hundred times\r\nits own length[484].--Aristophanes, in order to make the great and\r\ngood Athenian philosopher, Socrates, appear ridiculous, represents\r\nhim as having measured the leap of a flea[485]. In our better times\r\nscientific men have done this without being laughed at for it, and\r\nhave ascertained that, comparatively, it equalled that of the locust,\r\nbeing also two hundred times its length. Being effected by muscular\r\nforce, without the aid of wings, this is an astonishing leap.--There\r\nare several insects, however, which, although they are furnished\r\nwith incrassated posterior thighs, do not jump. Of this description\r\nare some beetles belonging to the genus _Necydalis_, (_Oedemera_,\r\nOliv.) in which this seems a peculiarity of the male: and amongst the\r\n_Hymenoptera_, not to mention others, several species of _Chalcis_, and\r\nall that are known of that singular genus _Leucospis_.\r\n\r\nMany insects, that jump by means of their posterior legs, have not\r\nthese thighs. This is said to be the case with _Scaphidium_, a little\r\ntribe of beetles[486]: and one of the same order, that seems to come\r\nbetween _Anobium_ and _Ptilinus_, found by our friend the Rev. R.\r\nSheppard, and which I have named after him _Choragus Sheppardi_,\r\nis similarly circumstanced.--In the various tribes of frog-hoppers\r\n(_Cercopidæ_, &c.) the posterior tibiæ appear to be principally\r\nconcerned in their leaping. These are often very long, and furnished,\r\non their exterior margin, with a fringe of stiff hairs, or a series\r\nof strong spines, by pressing which against the plane of position\r\nthey are supposed to be aided in effecting this motion. On this\r\noccasion they bend their legs like the grasshoppers, and then\r\nunbending kick them out with violence[487]. Many of them, amongst\r\nthe rest _Cercopis spumaria_, have the extremity of the above tibiæ\r\narmed with a coronet of spines; these are of great use in pushing\r\nthem off when the legs are unbended. This insect, when about to leap,\r\nplaces its posterior thighs in a direction perpendicular to the plane\r\nof position, keeping them close to the body; it next with great\r\nviolence pushes them out backwards, so as to stretch the leg in a\r\nright line. These spines then lay hold of the surface, and by their\r\npressure enable the body to spring forwards, when, being assisted\r\nby its wings, it will make astonishing leaps, sometimes as much as\r\nfive or six feet, which is more than 250 times its own length; or\r\nas if a man of ordinary stature should be able at once to vault\r\nthrough the air to the distance of a quarter of a mile. Upon glass,\r\nwhere the spines are of no use, the insect cannot leap more than\r\nsix inches[488].--The species of another genus of the homopterous\r\n_Hemiptera_ (_Chermes_), that jump very nimbly by pushing out their\r\nshanks, are perhaps assisted in this motion by a remarkable horn\r\nlooking towards the anus, which arms their posterior hip.--Some bugs\r\nthat leap well, _Acanthia saltatoria_, &c. seem to have no particular\r\napparatus to assist them, except that their posterior tibiæ are very\r\nlong.--Several of the minute ichneumons also jump with great agility,\r\nbut by what means I am unable to say.--There is a tribe of spiders,\r\nnot spinners, that leap even sideways upon their prey. One of these\r\n(_Salticus scenicus_), when about to do this, elevates itself upon\r\nits legs, and lifting its head seems to survey the spot before it\r\njumps. When these insects spy a small gnat or fly upon a wall, they\r\ncreep very gently towards it with short steps, till they come within\r\na convenient distance, when they spring upon it suddenly like a\r\ntiger.--Bartram observed one of these spiders that jumped two feet\r\nupon a humble-bee. The most amusing account, however, of the motions\r\nof these animals is given by the celebrated Evelyn in his Travels.\r\nWhen at Rome, he often observed a spider of this kind hunting the\r\nflies which alighted upon a rail on which was its station. It kept\r\ncrawling under the rail till it arrived at the part opposite to\r\nthe fly, when stealing up it would attempt to leap upon it. If it\r\ndiscovered that it was not perfectly opposite, it would immediately\r\nslide down again unobserved, and at the next attempt would come\r\ndirectly upon the fly's back. Did the fly happen not to be within a\r\nleap, it would move towards it so softly, that its motion seemed not\r\nmore perceptible than that of the shadow of the gnomon of a dial.\r\nIf the intended prey moved, the spider would keep pace with it as\r\nexactly as if they were actuated by one spirit, moving backwards,\r\nforwards, or on each side without turning. When the fly took wing,\r\nand pitched itself behind the huntress, she turned round with the\r\nswiftness of thought, and always kept her head towards it, though\r\nto all appearance as immovable as one of the nails driven into the\r\nwood on which was her station: till at last, being arrived within\r\ndue distance, swift as lightning she made the fatal leap and secured\r\nher prey[489]. I have had an opportunity of observing very similar\r\nproceedings in _Salticus scenicus_.\r\n\r\nBut the legs of insects are not the only organs by which they leap.\r\nThe numerous species of the elastic beetles (_Elater_), skip-jacks as\r\nsome call them, perform this motion by means of a _pectoral process_\r\nor mucro. These animals having very short legs, when laid upon their\r\nbacks, cannot by their means recover a prone position. To supply this\r\nseeming defect in their structure, Providence has furnished them with\r\nan instrument which, when they are so circumstanced, enables them\r\nto spring into the air and recover their standing. If you examine\r\nthe breast (_pectus_) of one of these insects, you will observe\r\nbetween the base of the anterior pair of legs a short and rather\r\nblunt process, the point of which is towards the anus. Opposite to\r\nthis point, and a little before the base of the intermediate legs,\r\nyou will discover in the after-breast (_postpectus_) a rather deep\r\ncavity, in which the point is often sheathed. This simple apparatus\r\nis all that the insect wants to effect the above purpose. When\r\nlaid upon its back, in your hand if you please, it will first bend\r\nback, so as to form a very obtuse angle with each other, the head\r\nand trunk, and abdomen and metathorax, by which motion the mucro is\r\nquite liberated from its sheath; and then bending them in a contrary\r\ndirection, the mucro enters it again, and the former attitude being\r\nbriskly and suddenly resumed, the mucro flies out with a spring, and\r\nthe insect rising, sometimes an inch or two into the air, regains\r\nits legs and moves off. The upper part of the body, by its pressure\r\nagainst the plane of position, assists this motion, during which the\r\nlegs are kept close to its underside. Cuvier, when he says that man\r\nand birds are the only animals that can leap vertically[490], seems\r\nto have forgotten this leap of Elaters, which is generally vertical,\r\nthe trunk being vertically above the organ that produces the leap.\r\n\r\nOther insects again leap by means of the _abdomen_ or some organs\r\nattached to it. An apterous species--belonging to the _Ichneumonidæ_,\r\nand to the genus _Cryptus_--takes long leaps by first bending its\r\nabdomen inwards, as De Geer thinks, and then pushing it with force\r\nalong the plane of position[491]. There is a tribe of minute insects\r\namongst the _Aptera_, found often under bark, sometimes on the water,\r\nand in various other situations, which Linné has named _Podura_, a\r\nterm implying that they have a leg in their tail. This is literally\r\nthe fact. For the tail, or anal extremity, of these insects is\r\nfurnished with an inflexed fork[492], which, though usually bent\r\nunder the body, they have the power of unbending; during which\r\naction, the forked spring, pushing powerfully against the plane of\r\nposition, enables the animal to leap sometimes two or three inches.\r\nWhat is more remarkable, these little animals are by this organ\r\neven empowered to leap upon water. There is a minute black species\r\n(_P. aquatica_), which in the spring is often seen floating on that\r\ncontained in ruts, hollows, or even ditches, and in such infinite\r\nnumbers as to resemble gunpowder strewed upon the surface. When\r\ndisturbed, these black grains are seen to skip about as if ignited,\r\njumping with as much ease as if the fluid were a solid plane, that\r\nresists their pressure. The insects of another genus--separated from\r\n_Podura_ by Latreille under the name of _Sminthurus_--have also\r\nan anal spring, which when bent under the body nearly reaches the\r\nhead. These, which are of a more globose form than _Podura_, are so\r\nexcessively agile that it is almost impossible to take them. Pressing\r\ntheir spring against the surface on which they stand, and unbending\r\nit with force, they are out of your reach before your finger can come\r\nnear them. One of them, _S. fuscus_, besides the caudal fork, has a\r\nvery singular organ, the use of which is to prevent it from falling\r\nfrom a perpendicular surface, on which they are often found at a\r\ngreat height from the ground. Between the ends of the fork there is\r\nan elevated cylinder or tube, from which the animal, when necessary,\r\ncan protrude two long, filiform, flexible transparent threads covered\r\nwith a slimy secretion. By these, when it has lost its hold, it\r\nadheres to the surface on which it is stationed[493]. Another insect\r\nrelated to the common sugar-louse, and called by Latreille _Machilis\r\npolypoda_, in some places common under stones[494], has eight pair\r\nof springs, one on each ventral segment of the abdomen, by means of\r\nwhich it leaps to a wonderful distance, and with the greatest agility.\r\n\r\n_Climbing_ is another motion of insects that merits particular\r\nconsideration: since, as this includes their power of moving against\r\ngravity--as we see flies and spiders do upon our ceilings, and up\r\nperpendicular surfaces even when of glass--it affords room for much\r\ninteresting and curious inquiry. Climbing insects may be divided\r\ninto four classes.--Those that climb by means of their claws;--those\r\nthat climb by a soft cushion of dense hairs, that, more or less,\r\nlines the underside of the joints of their tarsi, the claw-joint\r\nexcepted;--those that climb by the aid of suckers, which adhere (a\r\nvacuum being produced between them and the plane of position) by the\r\npressure of the atmosphere;--and those that are enabled to climb by\r\nmeans of some substance which they have the power of secreting.\r\n\r\nThe first order of climbers--those that climb by means of their\r\n_claws_--includes a large proportion of insects, especially in the\r\n_Coleoptera_ order--the majority of those that have five joints\r\nin their tarsi being of this description. The predaceous tribes,\r\nparticularly the numerous and prowling ground-beetles (_Eutrechina_),\r\noften thus ascend the plants and trees after their prey. Thus one of\r\nthem, the beautiful but ferocious _Calosoma Sycophanta_, mounts the\r\ntrunk and branches of the oak to commit fearful ravages amongst the\r\nhordes of caterpillars that inhabit it[495]. By these the less savage\r\nbut equally destructive tree-chafers (_Melolonthæ_), and those enemies\r\nof vegetable beauty the rose-chafers (_Cetonia aurata_), are enabled\r\nto maintain their station on the trees and shrubs that they lay waste.\r\nAnd by these also the water-beetles (_Dytiscus_, _Hydrophilus_, &c.)\r\nclimb the aquatic plants.--But it is unnecessary further to enlarge\r\nupon this head; I shall only observe, that in most of the insects here\r\nenumerated, the claws appear to be aided by stiff hairs or bristles.\r\n\r\nOther climbers ascend by means of _foot-cushions_ (_pulvilli_)\r\ncomposed of hairs, as thickly set as in plush or velvet, with which\r\nthe underside of the joints of their tarsi--the claw-joint, which is\r\nalways naked, excepted--are covered. These cushions are particularly\r\nconspicuous in the beautiful tribe of plant-beetles (_Chrysomelidæ_).\r\nA common insect of this kind, before mentioned, called the bloody-nose\r\nbeetle (_Timarcha tenebricosa_), by the aid of these is enabled\r\nto adhere to the trailing plants, the various species of bedstraw\r\n(_Galium_), on which it feeds; and by these will support itself against\r\ngravity; for both this and _Chrysomela goettingensis_ will walk upon\r\nthe hand with their back downwards, and it then requires a rather\r\nstrong pull to disengage them from their station.--The whole tribe of\r\nweevils (_Rhynchophora_, Latr.) are also furnished with these cushions,\r\nbut not always upon all their joints, some having them only at their\r\napex; and the palm-weevil (_Cordylia Palmarum_) at the extremity solely\r\nof the last joint but one.--Those brilliant beetles the _Buprestes_\r\nhave also these cushions, as have likewise the numerous tribes of\r\ncapricorn-beetles (_Longicornes_, Latr.). The larvæ of these being\r\ntimber-borers, the parent insect is probably thus enabled to adhere to\r\nthis substance whilst it deposits its eggs. Indeed in some species of\r\nthe former genus the cushions wear the appearance of suckers.--While\r\nthe linear species of _Helops_ are without them, they clothe all the\r\ntarsi of _H. æneus_ (_Chalcites_ K. Ms.)[496]. In two other genera of\r\nthe same order, _Silpha_ and _Cicindela_, the anterior tarsi of the\r\nmales are furnished with them; in these therefore they may be regarded,\r\nlike the suckers of the larger water-beetles (_Dytisci_), as given\r\nfor sexual purposes. The three first joints of the anterior tarsi of\r\nmany of the larger rove-beetles (_Staphylinus_, L.) are dilated so as\r\nto form, as in the last-mentioned insects, an orbicular patella, but\r\ncovered by cushions. Since in them this is not peculiar to the males,\r\nit is probably given that they may be able to support their long bodies\r\nwhen climbing.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable class of climbers consists of those that are\r\nfurnished with an apparatus by which they can form a _vacuum_, so as to\r\nadhere to the plane on which they are moving by atmospheric pressure.\r\nThat flies can walk upon glass placed vertically, and in general\r\nagainst gravity, has long been a source of wonder and inquiry; and\r\nvarious have been the opinions of scientific men upon the subject. Some\r\nimagined that the suckers on the feet of these animals were spunges\r\nfilled with a kind of gluten, by which they were enabled to adhere to\r\nsuch surfaces. This idea, though incorrect, was not so absurd as at\r\nfirst it may seem; since we have seen above in many instances, and\r\nvery lately in that of the _Sminthurus fuscus_, that insects are often\r\naided in their motions by a secretion of this kind. Hooke appears to\r\nhave been one of the first who remarked that the suspension of these\r\nanimals was produced by some mechanical contrivance in their feet.\r\nObserving that the claws alone could not effect this purpose, he justly\r\nconcluded that it must be principally owing to the mechanism of the two\r\npalms, pattens, or soles as he calls the suckers; these he describes as\r\nbeset underneath with small bristles or tenters, like the wire teeth\r\nof a card for working wool, which having a contrary direction to the\r\nclaws, and both pulling different ways, if there be any irregularity\r\nor yielding in the surface of a body, enable the fly to suspend itself\r\nvery firmly. That they walk upon glass, he ascribes to some ruggedness\r\nin the surface; and principally to a smoky tarnish which adheres to\r\nit, by means of which the fly gets footing upon it[497]. But these\r\ntenterhooks in the suckers of flies, and this smoky tarnish upon glass,\r\nare mere fancies, since they can walk as well upon the cleanest glass\r\nas upon the most tarnished. Reaumur also attributes this faculty of\r\nthese animals to the hairs upon their suckers[498]. That learned and\r\npious naturalist, Dr. Derham, seems to have been one of the first who\r\ngave the true solution of this enigma. \"Flies,\" says he, \"besides their\r\nsharp hooked nails, have also skinny palms to their feet, to enable\r\nthem to stick on glass and other smooth bodies, by the _pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere_[499].\" He compares these palms to the curious suckers\r\nof male _Dytisci_, before alluded to, and illustrates their action by\r\na common practice of boys, who carry stones by a wet piece of leather\r\napplied to their top. Another eminent and excellent naturalist, the\r\nlate Mr. White, adopted this solution. He observes that in the decline\r\nof the year, when the mornings and evenings become chilly, many species\r\nof flies retire into houses and swarm in the windows: that at first\r\nthey are very brisk and alert; but, as they grow more torpid, that they\r\nmove with difficulty, and are scarcely able to lift their legs, which\r\nseem as if glued to the glass; and that by degrees many do actually\r\nstick till they die in the place. Then noticing Dr. Derham's opinion\r\nas just stated, he further remarks, that they easily overcome the\r\natmospheric pressure when they are brisk and alert. But, he proceeds,\r\nin the decline of the year this resistance becomes too mighty for their\r\ndiminished strength; and we see flies labouring along, and lugging\r\ntheir feet in windows as if they stuck fast to the glass[500].\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Banks, to whom every branch of Natural History becomes\r\ndaily more indebted, has lately excited an inquiry, the results\r\nof which have confirmed Derham's system concerning this motion of\r\nanimals against gravity. When abroad, he had noticed that a lizard,\r\non account of the sound that it emits before rain, named the\r\nGecko[501] (_Lacerta Gecko_) could walk against gravity up the walls\r\nof houses; and comparing this with the parallel motions of flies, he\r\nwas desirous of having the subject more scientifically illustrated\r\nthan it had been. This inquiry was put into the able hands of Sir\r\nEverard Home, so justly celebrated as a comparative anatomist, who\r\nwas assisted in it by the incomparable pencil of Mr. Bauer: and\r\nit has been proved most satisfactorily, that it is by producing a\r\nvacuum between certain organs destined for that purpose and the plane\r\nof position, sufficient to cause atmospheric pressure upon their\r\nexterior surface, that the animals in question are enabled to walk\r\nup a polished perpendicular, like the glass in our windows and the\r\nchunam walls in India, or with their backs downward on a ceiling,\r\nwithout being brought to the ground by the weight of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe instruments by which a fly effects this purpose are two suckers\r\nconnected with the last joint of the tarsus by a narrow infundibular\r\nneck, which has power of motion in all directions, immediately under\r\nthe root of each claw. These suckers consist of a membrane capable\r\nof extension and contraction: they are concavo-convex with serrated\r\nedges, the concave surface being downy, and the convex granulated.\r\nWhen in action they are separated from each other, and the membrane\r\nexpanded so as to increase the surface: by applying this closely to\r\nthe plane of position, the air is sufficiently expelled to produce the\r\npressure necessary to keep the animal from falling. When the suckers\r\nare disengaged, they are brought together again so as to be confined\r\nwithin the space between the two claws. This may be seen by looking at\r\nthe movements of a fly in the inside of a glass tumbler with a common\r\nmicroscope[502]. Thus the fly you see does no more than the leech has\r\nbeen long known to do, when moving in a glass vessel. Furnished with a\r\nsucker at each extremity, by means of these organs it marches up and\r\ndown at its pleasure, or as the state of the atmosphere inclines it.\r\n\r\nDipterous insects, which in general have these organs, and some three\r\non each foot[503], are not exclusively gifted with them; for various\r\nothers in different orders have them, and some in greater numbers. As\r\nI lately observed, the foot-cushions of the Buprestes are something\r\nvery like them, particularly those of _B. fascicularis_.--A Brazilian\r\nbeetle in my cabinet, belonging to the family of the _Cleridæ_,\r\nbut not arranging well under any of Latreille's genera, which I\r\nhave named _Priocera variegata_, has curious involuted suckers on\r\nits feet.--The strepsipterous genera _Stylops_ and _Xenos_, are\r\nremarkable for the vesicles of membrane that cover the underside of\r\ntheir tarsi, which, though flaccid in old specimens, appear to be\r\ninflated in the living animal or those that are recent[504]. It is\r\nnot improbable that these vesicles, which are large and hairy, may\r\nact in some degree as suckers, and assist it in climbing.\r\n\r\nThe insects of the _Orthoptera_ order are, many of them, remarkable\r\nfor two kinds of appendages connected with my present subject,\r\nbeing furnished both with suckers and cushions. The former\r\nare concavo-convex processes, varying in shape in different\r\nspecies--being sometimes orbicular, sometimes ovate or oblong, and\r\noften wedge-shaped--which terminate the tarsus between the claw,\r\none on each foot. They are of a hard substance, and seem capable\r\nof free motion. In some instances[505], another minute cavity is\r\ndiscoverable at the base of the concave part, similar to that in\r\n_Cimbex lutea_[506]. The latter, the foot-cushions, are usually\r\nconvex appendages, of an oblong form, and often, though not always,\r\ndivided in the middle by a very deep longitudinal furrow, attached\r\nto the underside of the tarsal joints. Sir E. Home is of opinion\r\nthat the object of these foot-cushions is to take off the jar, when\r\nthe body of the animal is suddenly brought from a state of motion\r\nto a state of rest[507]. This may very likely be one of their uses,\r\nbut there are several circumstances which militate against its being\r\nthe only one. By their elasticity they probably assist the insects\r\nthat have them in their leaps; and when they climb they may in some\r\ndegree act as suckers, and prevent them from falling. But their use\r\nwill be best ascertained by a review of the principal genera of the\r\norder. Of these the cock-roaches (_Blatta_), the spectres (_Phasma_),\r\nand the praying insects (_Mantis_), are distinguished by tarsi of\r\nfive joints[508]. The grasshoppers with setaceous antennæ (_Acrida_)\r\nhave four tarsal joints. Those with filiform antennæ (_Locusta_ and\r\n_Acrydium_), those with ensiform (_Truxalis_[509]), and the crickets\r\n(_Gryllus_), have only three. In _Blatta_, the variations with\r\nrespect to the suckers and cushions (for many species are furnished\r\nwith both) are remarkable. The former in some (_Blatta gigantea_)\r\nare altogether wanting; in others (_B. Petiveriana_) they are mere\r\nrudiments; and in others (_B. Maderæ_) they are more conspicuous,\r\nand resemble those of the _Gryllidæ_. The foot-cushions also in some\r\nare nearly obsolete, and occupy the mere extremity of the four first\r\ntarsal joints (_B. orientalis_, _americana_, _capensis_, &c.). In\r\n_B. Petiveriana_ there is none upon the first joint; but upon the\r\nextremity of the four last, not excepting the claw-joint, there is\r\na minute orbicular concave one, resembling a sucker. In others (_B.\r\ngigantea_, &c.) they extend the length of the four first joints, and\r\nare very conspicuous. In some (_B. Mouffeti_, K.[510]), which have\r\nno claw-sucker, there appears to be a cavity in the extremity of the\r\nclaw-joint, which may serve the purpose of one. These foot-cushions\r\nare usually of a pale colour; but in one specimen of a hairy female\r\nwhich I have, from Brazil, they are black. The spectre genus\r\n(_Phasma_) exhibits no particular varieties in this respect. The\r\ntarsal joints of the legs have cushions at their apex, which appear\r\nto be bifid. They have a large orbicular sucker between the claws.\r\nIn _Mantis_ the fore feet have neither of the parts in question, and\r\nthe others have no suckers. They have cushions on the four first\r\ntarsal joints of the two last pair of legs, which, though smaller,\r\nare shaped much like those in _Phasma_. In _Acrida_ the feet have no\r\nsuckers between the claws, but they are distinguished by two oval,\r\nsoft, concave, and moveable processes attached to the base of the\r\nfirst joint of the tarsus, which probably act as suckers[511]. In\r\nthis genus there are two foot-cushions on the first joint of the\r\ntarsi, and one on each of the two following ones[512].--The species\r\nof the genus _Locusta_ come next. This genus is called _Acrydium_ by\r\nLatreille after Geoffroy; but, since it includes the true _locust_,\r\nit ought to retain the name _Locusta_ given by Linné to the tribe\r\nto which it belongs[513]. All these insects have the terminal\r\nsucker between the claws, three foot-cushions on the first joint of\r\nthe tarsus, and one on the second[514]; and the same conformation\r\nalso distinguishes the feet of _Truxalis_[515]. In the species of\r\n_Acrydium_, F. (_Tetrix_, Latr.), the foot-cushions, I believe--for\r\nin the dead insect they are the reverse of conspicuous--are arranged\r\nnearly as in the two preceding genera, but these insects are without\r\nthe claw-sucker. And lastly, _Gryllus_ has neither suckers nor\r\ncushions. From this statement it seems to follow--since _Blatta_,\r\n_Phasma_, and _Mantis_, that do not leap, are provided with cushions;\r\nand _Gryllus_, a heavy tribe of insects that does, are without\r\nthem--that their object cannot be exclusively to break the fall of\r\nthe insects that have them. And for the same reason we may conclude,\r\nthat they must have some further use than augmenting their elasticity\r\nwhen they jump. When we consider that the _Blattæ_--many of which\r\nhave no suckers, or very small ones--are climbing insects (I have\r\nseen _B. Germanica_ run up and down the walls of an apartment with\r\ngreat agility), and that the long and gigantic apterous spectres, &c.\r\n(_Phasma_) require considerable means to enable them to climb the\r\ntrees in which they feed, and to maintain their station upon them,\r\nwe may conclude that these cushions, by acting in some degree as\r\nsuckers, may promote these ends.\r\n\r\nAmongst the homopterous _Hemiptera_, _Chermes_ and many of the\r\n_Cercopidæ_[516] are furnished with the claw-suckers; but the noisy\r\n_Cicadæ_, as well as the heteropterous section, at least as far as\r\nmy examination of them has gone, have them not. De Geer has observed,\r\nspeaking of a small fly of this order (_Thrips Physapus_), that the\r\nextremity of its feet is furnished with a transparent membranaceous\r\nflexible process, like a bladder. He further says that, when the animal\r\nfixes and presses this vesicle on the surface on which it walks, its\r\ndiameter is increased, and it sometimes appears concave, the concavity\r\nbeing in proportion to the pressure; which made him suspect that it\r\nacted like a cupping-glass, and so produced the adhesion[517]. This\r\ncircumstance affords another proof that the foot-cushions in the\r\n_Orthoptera_ may act the same part; they appear to be vesicular; and\r\nin numbers of specimens, after death, I have observed that they become\r\nconcave, particularly in _Acrida viridissima_.\r\n\r\nIn _Cimbex_, and others amongst the saw-fly tribes, the claw-sucker\r\nis distinguished by this remarkable peculiarity, that its upper\r\nsurface is concave[518], so that before it is used it must be bent\r\ninwards. Besides these, at the extremity of each tarsal joint these\r\nanimals are furnished with a spoon-shaped sucker, which seems\r\nanalogous to the cushions in the _Gryllina_, _Locustina_, &c.: and,\r\nwhat is more remarkable, the two spurs (_calcaria_) at the apex of\r\nthe shanks have likewise each a minute one[519].--Various other\r\ninsects of this order have the claw-suckers. Amongst others the\r\ncommon wasp (_Vespa vulgaris_) is by these enabled to walk up and\r\ndown our glass windows.\r\n\r\nWe learn from De Geer that several mites, to finish with the\r\n_Aptera_, have something of this kind. Among these is the cheese-mite\r\n(_Acarus Siro_): its four fore feet being terminated by a vesicle\r\nwith a long neck, to which it can give every kind of inflexion.\r\nWhen it sets its foot down, it enlarges and inflates it; and when\r\nit lifts it up, it contracts it so that the vesicle almost entirely\r\ndisappears. This vesicle is between two claws[520].--The itch\r\nAcarus (_A. Scabiei_) is similarly circumstanced.--_Ixodes Ricinus_\r\nand _Reduvius_ have also these vesicles--which are armed with two\r\nclaws--on all their feet[521].\r\n\r\nI am next to consider those climbers that ascend and descend, and\r\nprobably maintain themselves in their station, by the assistance\r\nof a _secretion_ which they have the power of producing. You will\r\nimmediately perceive that I am speaking of the numerous tribes of\r\nspiders (_Araneidæ_), which, most of them, are endowed with this\r\nfaculty. Every body knows that these insects ascend and descend\r\nby means of a thread that issues from them; but perhaps every one\r\nhas not remarked--when they wish to avoid a hand held out to catch\r\nthem, or any other obstacle--that they can sway this thread from the\r\nperpendicular. When they move up or down, their legs are extended,\r\nsometimes gathering in and sometimes guiding their thread[522]; but\r\nwhen their motion is suspended, they are bent inwards. These animals,\r\nalthough they have no suckers or other apparatus--except the hairs\r\nof their legs and the three claws of their biarticulate tarsi, to\r\nenable them to do it--can also walk against gravity, both in a\r\nperpendicular and a prone position. Dr. Hulse, in Ray's _Letters_,\r\nseems to have furnished a clue that will very well explain this. I\r\ngive it you in his own homely phrase. \"They,\" spiders, \"will often\r\nfasten their threads in several places to the things they creep up;\r\nthe manner is by beating their bums or tails against them as they\r\ncreep along[523].\" Fixing their anus by means of a web, the anterior\r\npart of their body, when they are resting, we can readily conceive,\r\nwould be supported by the claws and hairs of their legs; and their\r\nmotion may be accomplished by alternately fixing one and then the\r\nother. But you will remember I give you this merely as conjecture,\r\nhaving never verified it by observation.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to mention here another apterous insect that\r\nreposes on perpendicular or prone surfaces, without either suckers\r\nor any viscous secretion by which it can adhere to them. I mean the\r\nlong-legged or shepherd spiders (_Phalangium_). The tarsi of these\r\ninsects are setaceous and nearly as fine as a hair, consisting\r\nsometimes of more than forty joints, those toward the extremity\r\nbeing very minute, and scarcely discernible, and terminating in a\r\nsingle claw. These tarsi, which resemble antennæ rather than feet,\r\nare capable of every kind of inflexion, sometimes even of a spiral\r\none. These circumstances enable them to apply their feet to the\r\ninequalities of the surface on which they repose, so that every joint\r\nmay in some measure become a point of support. Their eight legs\r\nalso, which diverge from their body like the spokes from the nave of\r\na wheel, give them equal hold of eight almost equidistant spaces,\r\nwhich, doubtless, is a great stay to them.\r\n\r\nThe next species of locomotion exhibited by perfect insects is\r\n_flying_. I am not certain whether under this head I ought to\r\nintroduce the sailing of spiders in the air; but as there is no other\r\nunder which it can be more properly arranged, I shall treat of it\r\nhere. I shall therefore divide flying insects into those that fly\r\nwithout wings, and those that fly with them.\r\n\r\nI dare say you are anxious to be told how any animals can fly\r\n_without wings_, and wish me to begin with them. As an observer of\r\nnature, you have often, without doubt, been astonished by that sight\r\noccasionally noticed in fine days in the autumn, of webs--commonly\r\ncalled gossamer webs--covering the earth and floating in the air; and\r\nhave frequently asked yourself--What are these gossamer webs? Your\r\nquestion has from old times much excited the attention of learned\r\nnaturalists. It was an old and strange notion that these webs were\r\ncomposed of dew burned by the sun.\r\n\r\n          \"...... The fine nets which oft we woven see\r\n           Of scorched dew,\"\r\n\r\nsays Spenser. Another, fellow to it, and equally absurd, was that\r\nadopted by a learned man and good natural philosopher, and one of\r\nthe first fellows of the Royal Society, Robert Hooke, the author of\r\n_Micrographia_. \"Much resembling a cobweb,\" says he, \"or a confused\r\nlock of these cylinders, is a certain white substance which, after a\r\nfogg, may be observed to fly up and down the air: catching several\r\nof these, and examining them with my microscope, I found them to\r\nbe much of the same form, looking most like to a flake of worsted\r\nprepared to be spun; though by what means they should be generated\r\nor produced is not easily imagined: they were of the same weight, or\r\nvery little heavier than the air; _and 'tis not unlikely, but that\r\nthose great white clouds, that appear all the summer time, may be\r\nof the same substance_[524].\" So liable are even the wisest men to\r\nerror when, leaving fact and experiment, they follow the guidance of\r\nfancy. Some French naturalists have supposed that these _fils de la\r\nVierge_, as they are called in France, are composed of the cottony\r\nmatter in which the eggs of the Coccus of the vine (_C. Vitis_) are\r\nenveloped[525]. In a country abounding in vineyards this supposition\r\nwould not be absurd; but in one like Britain, in which the vine is\r\nconfined to the fruit-garden, and the Coccus seldom seen out of the\r\nconservatory, it will not at all account for the phænomenon. What\r\nwill you say, if I tell you that these webs (at least many of them)\r\nare air-balloons--and that the aëronauts are not\r\n\r\n          \"Lovers who may bestride the gossamer\r\n           That idles in the wanton summer air,\r\n           And yet not fall\"--\r\n\r\nbut _spiders_, who long before Montgolfier, nay, ever since the\r\ncreation, have been in the habit of sailing through the fields of\r\nether in these air-light chariots! This seems to have been suspected\r\nlong ago by Henry Moore, who says,\r\n\r\n          \"As light and thin as cobwebs that do fly\r\n           In the blew air, caus'd by the autumnal sun,\r\n           That boils the dew that on the earth doth lie,\r\n           May seem this whitish rag then is the scum;\r\n          _Unless that wiser men make't the field-spider's loom_[526].\"\r\n\r\nWhere he also alludes to the old opinion of scorched dew. But the\r\nfirst naturalists who made this discovery appear to have been\r\nDr. Hulse and Dr. Martin Lister--the former first observing that\r\nspiders shoot their webs into the air; and the latter, besides this,\r\nthat they were carried upon them in that element[527]. This last\r\ngentleman, in fine serene weather in September, had noticed these\r\nwebs falling from the heavens, and in them discovered more than once\r\na spider, which he named the _bird_. On another occasion, whilst he\r\nwas watching the proceedings of a common spider, the animal suddenly\r\nturning upon its back and elevating its anus, darted forth a long\r\nthread, and vaulting from the place on which it stood, was carried\r\nupwards to a considerable height. Numerous observations afterwards\r\nconfirmed this extraordinary fact; and he further discovered, that\r\nwhile they fly in this manner, they pull in their long thread with\r\ntheir fore feet, so as to form it into a ball--or, as we may call it,\r\nair-balloon--of flake. The height to which spiders will thus ascend\r\nhe affirms is prodigious. One day in the autumn, when the air was\r\nfull of webs, he mounted to the top of the highest steeple of York\r\nminster, from whence he could discern the floating webs still very\r\nhigh above him. Some spiders that fell and were entangled upon the\r\npinnacles he took. They were of a kind that never enter houses, and\r\ntherefore could not be supposed to have taken their flight from the\r\nsteeple[528]. It appears from his observations, that this faculty\r\nis not confined to one species of spider, but is common to several,\r\nthough only in their young or half-grown state[529]; whence we may\r\ninfer, that when full-grown their bodies are too heavy to be thus\r\nconveyed. One spider he noticed that at one time contented itself\r\nwith ejaculating a single thread, while at others it darted out\r\nseveral, like so many shining rays at the tail of a comet. Of these,\r\nin Cambridgeshire in October, he once saw an incredible number\r\nsailing in the air[530]. Speaking of his _Ar. subfuscus minutissimis\r\noculis_, &c. he says, \"Certainly this is an excellent rope-dancer,\r\nand is wonderfully delighted with darting its threads: nor is it\r\nonly carried in the air, like the preceding ones; but it effects\r\nitself its ascent and sailing: for, by means of its legs closely\r\napplied to each other, it as it were balances itself, and promotes\r\nand directs its course no otherwise than as if nature had furnished\r\nit with wings or oars[531].\" A later but equally gifted observer of\r\nnature, Mr. White, confirms Dr. Lister's account. \"Every day in fine\r\nweather in autumn,\" says he, \"do I see these spiders shooting out\r\ntheir webs, and mounting aloft: they will go off from the finger,\r\nif you will take them into your hand. Last summer one alighted on\r\nmy book as I was reading in the parlour; and running to the top of\r\nthe page and shooting out a web, took its departure from thence.\r\nBut what I most wondered at was, that it went off with considerable\r\nvelocity in a place where no air was stirring; and I am sure that\r\nI did not assist it with my breath. So that these little crawlers\r\nseem to have while mounting some locomotive power without the use\r\nof wings, and move faster than the air in the air itself[532].\" A\r\nwriter in the last number of Thomson's _Annals of Philosophy_[533],\r\nunder the signature of Carolan, has given some curious observations\r\non the mode in which some geometric spiders shoot and direct their\r\nthreads, and fly upon them; by which it appears, that as they dart\r\nthem out they guide them as if by magic, emitting at the same time\r\na stream of air, as he supposes, or possibly some subtile electric\r\nfluid. One which was running upon his hand, dropped by its thread\r\nabout six inches from the point of his finger, when it immediately\r\nemitted a pretty long line at a right angle with that by which it\r\nwas suspended. This thread, though at first horizontal, quickly rose\r\nupwards, carrying the spider along with it. When it had ascended as\r\nfar above his finger as it had dropped before below it, it let out\r\nthe thread by which it had been attached to it, and continued flying\r\nsmoothly upwards till it nearly reached the roof of the room, when it\r\nveered on one side and alighted on the wall. In flying, its motion\r\nwas smoother and quicker than when a spider runs along its thread.\r\nHe observes, that as the line lengthens behind them, the tendency of\r\nspiders to rise increases.--I have myself more than once observed\r\nthese creatures take their flight, and find the following memorandum\r\nwith respect to their mode of proceeding. \"The spider first extends\r\nits thighs, shanks, and feet, into a right line, and then elevating\r\nits abdomen till it becomes vertical, shoots its thread into the\r\nair, and flies off from its station.\" It is not often, however, that\r\nan observer can be gratified with this interesting sight, since\r\nthese animals are soon alarmed. I have frequently noticed them--for\r\nat the times when these webs are floating in the air they are very\r\nnumerous--on the vertical angle of a post, or pale, or one of the\r\nuprights of a gate, with the end of their abdomen pointing upwards,\r\nas if to shoot their thread previously to flying off; when, upon\r\nmy approaching to take a nearer view, they have lowered it again,\r\nand persisted in disappointing my wish to see them mount aloft. The\r\nrapidity with which the spider vanishes from the sight upon this\r\noccasion and darts into the air, is a problem of no easy solution.\r\nCan the length of web that they dart forth counterpoise the weight\r\nof their bodies; or have they any organ analogous to the natatory\r\nvesicles of fishes[534], which contributes at their will to render\r\nthem buoyant in the air? Or do they rapidly ascend their threads\r\nin their usual way, and gather them up, till having collected them\r\ninto a mass of sufficient magnitude, they give themselves to the\r\nair, and are carried here and there in these chariots? I must here\r\ngive you Mr. White's very curious account of a shower of these webs\r\nthat he witnessed. On the 21st of September 1741, intent upon field\r\ndiversions, he rose before day-break; but on going out, he found\r\nthe whole face of the country covered with a thick coat of cobweb,\r\ndrenched with dew, as if two or three setting-nets had been drawn one\r\nover the other. When his dogs attempted to hunt, their eyes were so\r\nblinded and hoodwinked that they were obliged to lie down and scrape\r\nthemselves. This appearance was followed by a most lovely day. About\r\nnine A. M. a shower of these webs (formed not of single floating\r\nthreads, but of perfect flakes, some near an inch broad, and five or\r\nsix long,) was observed falling from very elevated regions, which\r\ncontinued without interruption during the whole of the day;--and\r\nthey fell with a velocity which showed that they were considerably\r\nheavier than the atmosphere. When the most elevated station in the\r\ncountry where this was observed was ascended, the webs were still to\r\nbe seen descending from above, and twinkling like stars in the sun,\r\nso as to draw the attention of the most incurious. The flakes of the\r\nweb on this occasion hung so thick upon the hedges and trees, that\r\nbaskets-full might have been collected. No one doubts, he observes,\r\nbut that these webs are the production of small spiders, which swarm\r\nin the fields in fine weather in autumn, and have a power of shooting\r\nout webs from their tails, so as to render themselves buoyant and\r\nlighter than the air[535]. In Germany these flights of gossamer\r\nappear so constantly in autumn, that they are there metaphorically\r\ncalled \"_Der fliegender Sommer_\" (the flying or departing summer);\r\nand authors speak of the web as often hanging in flakes like wool on\r\nevery hedge and bush throughout extensive districts.\r\n\r\nHere we may inquire--Why is the ground in these serene days covered\r\nso thickly by these webs, and what becomes of them? What occasions\r\nthe spiders to mount into the air, and do the same species form\r\nboth the terrestrial and aërial gossamer?--And what causes the\r\nwebs at last to fall to the earth? I fear I cannot to all these\r\nqueries return a fully satisfactory answer; but I will do the best\r\nI can. At first one would conclude from analogy, that the object\r\nof the gossamer which early in the morning is spread over stubbles\r\nand fallows--and sometimes so thickly as to make them appear as\r\nif covered with a carpet, or rather overflown by a sea, of gauze,\r\npresenting, when studded with dew-drops, as I have often witnessed, a\r\nmost enchanting spectacle--is to entrap the flies and other insects\r\nas they rise into the air from their nocturnal station of repose, to\r\ntake their diurnal flights. But Dr. Strack's observations render this\r\nvery doubtful; for he kept many of the spiders that produce these\r\nwebs in a large glass upon turf, where they spun as when at liberty,\r\nand he could never observe them attempt to catch or eat--even when\r\nentangled in their webs--the flies and gnats with which he supplied\r\nthem; though they greedily sucked water when sprinkled upon the\r\nturf, and remained lively for two months without other food[536]. As\r\nthe single threads shot by other spiders are usually their bridges,\r\nthis perhaps may be the object of the webs in question: and thus\r\nthe animals may be conveyed from furrow to furrow or straw to straw\r\nless circuitously, and with less labour, than if they had travelled\r\nover the ground. As these creatures seem so thirsty, may we not\r\nconjecture that the drops of dew, with which they are always as it\r\nwere strung, are a secondary object with them? So prodigious are\r\ntheir numbers, that sometimes every stalk of straw in the stubbles,\r\nand every clod and stone in the fallows, swarms with them. Dr. Strack\r\nassures us that twenty or thirty often sit upon a single straw, and\r\nthat he collected about 2000 in half an hour, and could have easily\r\ndoubled the number had he wished it: he remarks, that the cause of\r\ntheir escaping the notice of other observers, is their falling to the\r\nground upon the least alarm.\r\n\r\nAs to what becomes of this immense carpeting of web there are\r\ndifferent opinions. Mr. White conjectures that these threads, when\r\nfirst shot, might be entangled in the rising dew, and so drawn up,\r\nspiders and all, by a brisk evaporation, into the region where the\r\nclouds are formed[537]. But this seems almost as inadmissible as\r\nthat of Hooke, before related. An ingenious and observant friend,\r\nthinking the numbers of the flying spiders not sufficient to produce\r\nthe whole of the phenomenon in question, is of opinion that an\r\nequinoctial gale, sweeping along the fallows and stubbles coated with\r\nthe gossamer, must bring many single threads into contact, which,\r\nadhering together, may gradually collect into flakes; and that being\r\nat length detached by the violence of the wind, they are carried\r\nalong with it: and as it is known that such winds often convey even\r\nsand and earth to great heights, he deems it highly probable that so\r\nlight a substance may be transported to so great an elevation, as not\r\nto fall to the earth for some days after, when the weather has become\r\nserene, or to descend upon ships at sea, as has sometimes happened.\r\nThis, which is in part adopted from the German authors, is certainly\r\na much more reasonable supposition than the other; but some facts\r\nseem to militate against it: for, in the first place, though gossamer\r\noften occurs upon the ground when there is none in the air, yet the\r\nreverse of this has never been observed; for gossamer in the air, as\r\nin the instance recorded by Mr. White, is always preceded by gossamer\r\non the ground. Now, since the weather is constantly calm and serene\r\nwhen these showers appear, it cannot be the wind that carries the web\r\nfrom the ground into the air. Again, it is stated that these showers\r\ntake place after _several_ calm days[538]: now, if the web was raised\r\nby the wind into the air, it would begin to fall as soon as the wind\r\nceased. Whence I am inclined to think that the cause assigned by Dr.\r\nLister is the real source of the whole phenomenon. Though ordinary\r\nobservers have overlooked them, he noticed these spiders in the air\r\nin such prodigious numbers, that he deemed them sufficient to produce\r\nthe effect. I shall not, however, decide positively; but, having\r\nstated the different opinions, leave you to your own judgement.\r\n\r\nThe next query is, What occasions the spiders to mount their chariots\r\nand seek the clouds? Is it in pursuit of their food? Insects, in the\r\nfine warm days in which this phenomenon occurs, probably take higher\r\nflights than usual, and seek the upper regions of the atmosphere; and\r\nthat the spiders catch them there, appears by the exuviæ of gnats and\r\nflies, which are often found in the falling webs[539]. Yet one would\r\nsuppose that insects would fly high at all times in the summer in\r\nserene warm weather. Perhaps the flight of some particular species\r\nconstituting a favourite food of our little charioteers--the gnats,\r\nfor instance, which we have seen sometimes rise in clouds into the\r\nair[540]--may at these times take place; or the species of spiders\r\nthat are most given to these excursions, may not abound in their\r\nyoung state--when only they can fly--at other seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nWhether the same species that cover the earth with their webs produce\r\nthose that fill the air, is to be our next inquiry. Did the appearance\r\nof the one always succeed that of the other, this might be reasonably\r\nconcluded:--but the former, as I lately observed to you, often occurs\r\nwithout being followed by the latter. Yet, since it should seem that\r\nthe aërial gossamer, though it does not always follow it, is always\r\npreceded by the terrestrial, this warrants a conjecture that they may\r\nbe synonymous. Two German authors, Bechstein[541] and Strack[542],\r\nhave described the spider that produces gossamer in Germany under the\r\nname of _Aranea obtextrix_[542]. But it is not clear, unless they have\r\ndescribed it at different ages, when spiders often greatly change their\r\nappearance, that they mean the same species. The former describes his\r\nas of the size of a small pin's head, with its eight eyes disposed in\r\na circle, having a black-brown body and light-yellow legs: while Dr.\r\nStrack represents his _A. obtextrix_ as more than two lines in length;\r\neyes four in a square, and two on each side touching each other;\r\nthorax deep brown with paler streaks; abdomen below dull white, above\r\ndark copper brown, with a dentated white spot running longitudinally\r\ndown the middle. The first of these, if distinct, as I suspect they\r\nare, agrees very well with the young of one which Lister observed\r\nas remarkable for taking aërial flights[543]; and which I have most\r\nusually seen so engaged. The other may possibly be that before noticed,\r\nwhich he found in such infinite numbers in Cambridgeshire[544]. If\r\nthis conjecture be correct, it will prove that the same species first\r\nproduce the gossamer that covers the ground, and then, shooting other\r\nthreads, mount upon them into the air.\r\n\r\nMy last query was, What causes these webs ultimately to fall to the\r\nearth? Mr. White's observation will I think furnish the best answer.\r\n\"If the spiders have the power of coiling up their webs in the air,\r\nas Dr. Lister affirms, then when they become heavier than the air\r\nthey will fall[545].\" The more expanded the web, the lighter and more\r\nbuoyant, and the more condensed, the heavier it must be.\r\n\r\nI trust you will allow from this mass of evidence, that the English\r\n_Arachnologists_--may I coin this term?--were correct in their account\r\nof this singular phenomenon; and think, with me, that Swammerdam (who\r\nhowever admits that spiders sail on their webs), and after him De\r\nGeer, were rather hasty when they stigmatized the discovery that these\r\nanimals shoot their webs into the air, and so take flight, as a strange\r\nand unfounded opinion[546]. The fact, though so well authenticated,\r\nis indeed strange and wonderful, and affords another proof of the\r\nextraordinary powers, unparalleled in the higher orders of animals,\r\nwith which the Creator has gifted the insect world. Were indeed man and\r\nthe larger animals, with their present propensities, similarly endowed,\r\nthe whole creation would soon go to ruin. But these almost miraculous\r\npowers in the hands of these little beings only tend to keep it in\r\norder and beauty. Adorable is that Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, that\r\nhas distinguished these next to nothings by such peculiar endowments\r\nfor our preservation as if given to the strong and mighty would work\r\nour destruction.\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing marvellous detail of the aërial excursions of\r\nour insect air-balloonists, I fear you will think the motions of\r\nthose which fly by means of _wings_ less interesting. You will\r\nfind, however, that they are not altogether barren of amusement.\r\nThough the wings are the principal instruments of the flight of\r\ninsects, yet there are others subsidiary to them, which I shall here\r\nenumerate, considering them more at large under the orders to which\r\nthey severally belong. These are wing-cases (_Elytra_, _Tegmina_,\r\nand _Hemelytra_); winglets (_Alulæ_); poisers (_Halteres_); tailets\r\n(_Caudulæ_); hooklets (_Hamuli_); base-covers (_Tegulæ_), &c.\r\nBesides, their _tails_, _legs_, and even _antennæ_, assist them in\r\nsome instances, in this motion.\r\n\r\nAs _wings_ are common to almost the whole class, I shall consider\r\ntheir structure here. Every wing consists of two membranes, more\r\nor less transparent, applied to each other: the upper membrane\r\nbeing very strongly attached to the nervures (_Neuræ_), and the\r\nlower adhering more loosely, so as to be separable from them. The\r\nnervures[547] are a kind of hollow tube,--above elastic, horny,\r\nand convex; and flat and nearly membranaceous below,--which take\r\ntheir origin in the trunk, and keep diminishing gradually, the\r\nmarginal ones excepted, to their termination. The vessels contained\r\nin the nervures consist of a spiral thread, whence they appear to\r\nbe air-vessels communicating with the tracheæ in the trunk.--The\r\nexpansion of the wing at the will of the insect, is a problem that\r\ncan only be solved by supposing that a subtile fluid is introduced\r\ninto these vessels, which seem perfectly analogous to those in the\r\nwings of birds; and that thus an impulse is communicated to every\r\npart of the organ, sufficient to keep it in proper tension. We see\r\nby this, that a wing is supported in its flight like a sail by its\r\ncordage[548]. It is remarkable that those insects which keep the\r\nlongest on the wing, the dragon-flies (_Libellulina_) for instance,\r\nhave their wings most covered with nervures. The wings of insects in\r\nflying, like those of other flying animals, you are to observe, move\r\nvertically, or up and down.\r\n\r\nIn considering the flight of insects, I shall treat of that of each\r\norder separately, beginning with the _Coleoptera_ or beetles. Their\r\nsubsidiary instruments of flight are their wing-cases (_Elytra_),\r\nand in one instance, winglets (_Alulæ_). The former[549], which in\r\nsome are of a hard horny substance, and in others are softer and\r\nmore like leather, though they are kept immoveable in flight, are\r\nprobably, by their resistance to the air, not without their use\r\non this occasion. The winglets are small concavo-convex scales,\r\nof a stiff membranaceous substance, generally fringed at their\r\nextremity[550]. I know at present of only one coleopterous insect\r\nthat has them (_Dytiscus marginalis_). They are placed under the\r\nelytra at their base. Their use is unknown; but it may probably be\r\nconnected with their flight. The wings of beetles[551] are usually\r\nvery ample, often of a substance between parchment and membrane. The\r\nnervures that traverse and extend them, though not numerous, are\r\nstronger and larger than those in the wings of insects of the other\r\norders, and are so dispersed as to give perfect tension to the organ.\r\nWhen at rest--except in _Molorchus_, _Atractocerus_, _Necydalis_,\r\nand some other genera--they are folded transversely under the\r\nelytra, generally near the middle, with a lateral longitudinal fold,\r\nbut occasionally near the extremity[552]. When they prepare for\r\nflight, their antennæ being set out, the elytra are opened so as to\r\nform an angle with the body and admit the free play of the wings,\r\nand they then fly off, striking the air by the vertical motion of\r\nthese organs, the elytra all the while remaining immoveable. During\r\ntheir flight the bodies of insects of this order, as far as I have\r\nobserved them, are always in a position nearly vertical, which gives\r\nto the larger sorts, the stag-beetle for instance, a very singular\r\nappearance. Olivier, probably having some of the larger and heavier\r\nbeetles in his eye, affirms that the wings of insects of this order\r\nare not usually proportioned to the weight of their bodies, and that\r\nthe muscular apparatus that moves them is deficient in force. In\r\nconsequence of which, he observes, they take flight with difficulty,\r\nand fly very badly. The strokes of their wings being frequent, and\r\ntheir flight short, uncertain, heavy, and laborious, they can use\r\ntheir wings only in very calm weather, the least wind beating them\r\ndown. Yet he allows that others, whose body is lighter, rise into\r\nthe air and fly with a little more ease; especially when the weather\r\nis warm and dry, their flights however being short, though frequent.\r\nHe asserts also, that no coleopterous insect can fly against the\r\nwind[553]. These observations may hold perhaps with respect to many\r\nspecies; but they will by no means apply generally. The cockchafer\r\n(_Melolontha vulgaris_), if thrown into the air in the evening, its\r\ntime of flight, will take wing before it falls to the ground. The\r\ncommon dung-chafer (_Geotrupes stercorarius_)--wheeling from side to\r\nside like the humble-bee--flies with great rapidity and force, and,\r\nwith all its dung-devouring confederates, directs its flight with\r\nthe utmost certainty, and probably often against the wind, to its\r\nfood. The root-devourers or tree-chafers (_Melolontha_, _Hoplia_,\r\n&c.) support themselves, like swarming bees, in the air and over\r\nthe trees, flying round in all directions. The _Brachyptera_ and\r\n_Donaciæ_, in warm weather, fly off from their station with the\r\nutmost ease;--their wings are unfolded, and they are in the air in\r\nan instant, especially the latter, as I have often found when I have\r\nattempted to take them. None are more remarkable for this than the\r\n_Cicindelæ_, which, however, taking very short flights, are as easily\r\nmarked down as a partridge, and affords as much amusement to the\r\nentomologist, as the latter to the sportsman.--It is to be observed\r\nthat many insects in this order have no wings, and the female\r\nglow-worms neither wings nor elytra.\r\n\r\nMany persons are not aware that the insects of the next order,\r\nthe _Dermaptera_, can fly: but earwigs (_Forficula_), their size\r\nconsidered, are furnished with very ample and curious wings, the\r\nprincipal nervures of which are so many radii, diverging from a\r\ncommon point near the anterior margin. Between these are others\r\nwhich, proceeding from the opposite margin, terminate in the middle\r\nof the wing[554]. These organs, when at rest, are more than once\r\nfolded both transversely and longitudinally.\r\n\r\nWings equally ample, forming the quadrant of a circle, and with\r\nfive or six nervures diverging from their base, distinguish\r\nthe _strepsipterous_ tribe. When unemployed, these are folded\r\nlongitudinally[555].\r\n\r\nProbably in the next order (_Orthoptera_), the _Tegmina_, or\r\nwing-covers--since they are usually of a much thinner substance\r\nthan elytra--assist them in flying. They are however quite covered\r\nby irregular reticulations, produced by various nervures sent forth\r\nby the longitudinal ones, and running in all directions. When at\r\nrest, the inner part of one laps over that of the other[556]: but in\r\ndifferent genera there is a singular variation in this circumstance.\r\nThus in _Blatta_, _Phasma_, and male _Acridæ_, and generally\r\nspeaking, but not invariably, in _Locusta_ and _Truxalis_,--the left\r\nelytrum laps over the right: but in _Mantis_; _Mantispa_; some\r\nfemale _Acridæ_; _Gryllus_; and _Gryllotalpa_; the right is laid over\r\nthe left. The wings in this order, though always ample and larger\r\nthan the tegmina, do not invariably form a quadrant of a circle,\r\nfalling often short of it. They are extended by means of nervures,\r\nwhich, like so many rays, diverge from the base of the wing, and\r\nare intersected alternately by transverse ones, which thus form\r\nquadrangular areas, arranged like bricks in a wall. When at rest,\r\nthey are longitudinally folded. The flight of these insects, as far\r\nas it has been observed, much resembles, it is said, that of certain\r\nbirds. Ray tells us that both sexes of the house-cricket (_Gryllus\r\ndomesticus_) fly with an undulating motion, like a woodpecker,\r\nalternately ascending with expanded wings, and descending with folded\r\nones[557]. The field- and mole-crickets (_Gryllus campestris_ and\r\n_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_), as we learn from Mr. White[558],--and,\r\nsince the structure of their wings is similar, probably the other\r\n_Orthoptera_,--fly in the same way.\r\n\r\n_Hemipterous_ insects, with respect to their _Hemelytra_, may\r\nbe divided into two classes. Those in which they are all of the\r\nsame substance--varying from membrane to a leathery or horny\r\ncrust[559]--and those in which the base and the apex are of different\r\nsubstances; the first being generally corneous, and the latter\r\nmembranaceous[560]. The former or homopterous division includes the\r\n_Cicadariæ_, Latr.; _Aphis_; _Chermes_; _Thrips_; and _Coccus_;--and\r\nthe latter the heteropterous division, comprehending besides the\r\n_Geocorisæ_, Latr., _Notonecta_; _Sigara_; _Nepa_; _Ranatra_; and\r\n_Naucoris_ of Fabricius. The posterior tibiæ of some of this last\r\ndivision (_Lygæus phyllopus_, _foliaceus_, &c. F.) are furnished\r\non each side with a foliaceous process--which may act the part of\r\noutriggers, and assist them in their flight[561]. I can give you no\r\nparticular information with respect to the aërial movements of the\r\ninsects of this order: the British species that belong to it are\r\ngenerally so minute that it is not easy to trace them with the naked\r\neye; and unless some kind optician, which is much to be wished, would\r\ninvent a telescope by which the proceedings of insects could be\r\nexamined at a distance, there is no other way of studying them.\r\n\r\nThe four wings of the next order, the _Trichoptera_ or case-worm\r\nflies, both in their shape and nervures resemble those of many\r\nmoths[562]; only instead of scales they are usually covered with\r\nhairs, and the under wings, which are larger than the upper, fold\r\nlongitudinally. Some of these flies, I have observed, move in a\r\ndirect line, with their legs set out, which makes them look as if\r\nthey were walking in the air. In flying they often apply their\r\nantennæ to each other, stretching them out straight, and thus\r\nprobably are assisted in their motion.\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidoptera_ vary so infinitely in the shape, comparative\r\nmagnitude, and appendages of their wings, that I should detain you\r\ntoo long did I enlarge upon so multifarious a subject. I shall\r\ntherefore only observe, that one species is described, both by Lyonet\r\nand De Geer[563] (_Lobophora hexaptera_), as having six wings; for\r\nbesides the four ordinary ones, it has a winglet (_Alula_) attached\r\nto the base of the lower one, and placed, when the wings are folded,\r\nbetween it and the upper. These organs in this order you know are\r\ncovered with scales of various shapes[564]. Their nervures are\r\ndiverging rays, which issue either from a basal area or from the\r\nbase itself, and terminate in the exterior margin[565]. The wings of\r\nmany male butterflies, hawk-moths, and moths, are distinguished by\r\na remarkable apparatus, noticed by De Geer, and since by many other\r\nnaturalists[566] for keeping them steady and underanged in their\r\nflight. The upper wings, on their underside near their base, have a\r\nminute process, bent into a hook (_Hamus_), and covered with hairs\r\nand scales. In this hook one or more bristles (_Tendo_), attached to\r\nthe base of the under wing, have their play. When the fly unfolds its\r\nwings, the hook does not quit its hold of the bristle, which moves to\r\nand fro in it as they expand or close. The females, which seldom fly\r\nfar, often have the bristles but never the hook. The hairy tails of\r\nsome insects, _Sesia_, belonging to the hawk-moth tribe, are expanded\r\nwhen they fly, so as to form a kind of rudder, which enables them to\r\nsteer their course with more certainty.\r\n\r\nThe insects of this, and of every other order, except the\r\n_Coleoptera_, fly with their bodies in a horizontal position,\r\nor nearly so. As their wings are usually so ample, we need not\r\nwonder that the _Lepidoptera_ are excellent fliers. Indeed they\r\nseem to flit untired from flower to flower, and from field to\r\nfield; impelled at one while by hunger, and at another by love or\r\nmaternal solicitude.--The distance to which some males will fly is\r\nastonishing. That of one of the silk-worm moths (_Attacus Paphia_)\r\nis stated to travel sometimes more than a hundred miles in this\r\nway[567].--Our most beautiful butterfly, the purple emperor (_Apatura\r\nIris_), when he makes his first appearance fixes his throne on the\r\nsummit of some lofty oak, from whence in sunny days, unattended by\r\nhis empress, who does not fly, he takes his excursions. Launching\r\ninto the air from one of the highest twigs, he mounts often to\r\nso great a height as to become invisible. When the sun is at the\r\nmeridian his loftiest flights take place; and about four in the\r\nafternoon he resumes his station of repose[568].--The large bodies of\r\nhawk-moths (_Sphinx_, F.) are carried by wings remarkably strong both\r\nas to nervures and texture, and their flight is proportionably rapid\r\nand direct. That of butterflies is by dipping and rising alternately,\r\nso as to form a zigzag line with vertical angles, which the animal\r\noften describes with a skipping motion, so that each zigzag consists\r\nof smaller ones. This doubtless renders it more difficult for the\r\nbirds to take them as they fly; and thus the male, when paired, often\r\nflits away with the female.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Neuropterous_ tribes the most conspicuous insects are\r\nthe dragon-flies (_Libellulina_), which--their metamorphosis, habits,\r\nmode of life, and characters considered--form a distinct natural order\r\nof themselves. Their four wings, which are nearly equal in size, are\r\na complete and beautiful piece of net-work, resembling the finest\r\nlace, the meshes of which are usually filled by a pure, transparent,\r\nglassy membrane. In two of the genera belonging to this tribe, the\r\nwings, when the animal is at rest, are always expanded, so that they\r\ncan take flight in an instant, no previous unfolding of these organs\r\nbeing necessary. In _Agrion_, the other genus of the tribe, the wings\r\nwhen they repose are not expanded. I have observed of these insects,\r\nand also of several others in different orders, that without turning\r\nthey can fly in all directions--backwards, and to the right and left,\r\nas well as forwards. This ability to fly all ways, without having to\r\nturn, must be very useful to them when pursued by a bird. Leeuwenhoek\r\nonce saw a swallow chasing an insect of this tribe, which he calls\r\na _Mordella_, in a menagerie about a hundred feet long. The little\r\ncreature flew with such astonishing velocity--to the right--to the\r\nleft--and in all directions--that this bird of rapid wing and ready\r\nevolution was unable to overtake and entrap it; the insect eluding\r\nevery attempt, and being generally six feet before it[569]. Indeed,\r\nsuch is the power of the long wings by which the dragon-flies are\r\ndistinguished, particularly in _Æshna_ and _Libellula_, and such the\r\nforce of the muscles that move them, that they seem never to be wearied\r\nwith flying. I have observed one of the former genus (_Anax Imperator_,\r\nLeach) sailing for hours over a piece of water--sometimes to and fro,\r\nand sometimes wheeling from side to side; and all the while chasing,\r\ncapturing, and devouring the various insects that came athwart its\r\ncourse, or driving away its competitors--without ever seeming tired, or\r\ninclined to alight. Another species (_Æshna variegata_), very common\r\nin lanes and along hedges, which flies, like the _Orthoptera_, in a\r\nwaving line, is equally alert and active after its prey. This however\r\noften alights for a moment, and then resumes its gay excursive flights.\r\nThe species of the genus _Agrion_ cut the air with less velocity;\r\nbut so rapid is the motion of their wings, that they become quite\r\ninvisible. Hawking always about for prey, the Agrions, from the variety\r\nof the colours of different individuals, form no uninteresting object\r\nduring a summer stroll. With respect to the mode of flight of the\r\nother neuropterous tribes I have nothing to remark; for that of the\r\n_Ephemeræ_, which has been most noticed, I shall consider under another\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe next order of insects, the _Hymenoptera_, attract also general\r\nattention as fliers, and from our earliest years. The ferocious hornet,\r\nwith its trumpet of terror; the intrusive and indomitable wasp;\r\nthe booming and pacific humble-bee, the frequent prey of merciless\r\nschoolboys; and that universal favourite, the industrious inhabitant\r\nof the hive,--all belonging to it,--are familiar to every one. And in\r\nsummer-time there is scarcely a flower or leaf in field or garden,\r\nwhich is not visited by some of its numerous tribes. The four wings\r\nof these insects, the upper pair of which are larger than the under,\r\nvary much in their nervures. From the saw-flies (_Serrifera_), whose\r\nwings are nearly as much reticulated as those of some _Neuroptera_, to\r\nthe minute _Chalcis_ and _Psilus_, in which these organs are without\r\nnervures, there is every intermediate variety of reticulation that\r\ncan be imagined[570]. It has been observed that the nervures of the\r\nwings are usually proportioned to the weight of the insect. Thus the\r\nsaw-flies have generally bodies thicker than those of most other\r\n_Hymenoptera_, while those that have fewer nervures are more slender.\r\nThis, however, does not hold good in all cases--so that the dimensions\r\nand cut of the wings, the strength of their nervures, and the force\r\nof their muscles, must also be taken into consideration. The wings of\r\nmany of these insects when expanded, are kept in the same plane by\r\nmeans of small hooks (_Hamuli_) in the anterior margin of the under\r\nwing, which lay hold of the posterior margin of the upper[571]. Another\r\npeculiarity also distinguishes them. Base covers (_Tegulæ_), or small\r\nconcavo-convex shields, protect the base of the wings from injury[572],\r\nor displacement.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful fliers in this order are the humble-bees, which,\r\nlike the dung-chafers (_Geotrupes_), traverse the air in segments\r\nof a circle, the arc of which is alternately to right and left. The\r\nrapidity of their flight is so great, that could it be calculated,\r\nit would be found, the size of the creature considered, far to\r\nexceed that of any bird.--The aërial movements of the hive-bee are\r\nmore direct and leisurely. When leaving the hive for an excursion,\r\nI have observed that as soon as they come out they turn about as\r\nif to survey the entrance, and then wheeling round in a circle,\r\nfly off. When they return to the hive, they often fly from side to\r\nside, as if to examine before they alight. When swarming, the heads\r\nof all are turned towards the group at the mouth of their dwelling;\r\nand upon rising into the air these little creatures fly so thick in\r\nevery direction, as to appear like a kind of net-work with meshes of\r\nevery angle. The queen also, upon going forth, when her object is to\r\npair, after returning to reconnoitre, begins her flight by describing\r\ncircles of considerable diameter, thus rising spirally with a rapid\r\nmotion[573]. The object of these gyrations is probably to increase\r\nher chance of meeting with a drone.--I have not much to tell you\r\nwith respect to the flight of other insects of this order, except\r\nthat a spider-wasp (_Pompilus viaticus_) whose sting is redoubtable,\r\nand which often, when we are in the vicinity of sandy sunny banks,\r\naccompanies our steps, has a kind of jumping movement when it flies.\r\n\r\nThe next order, the _Diptera_, consists altogether of two-winged\r\nflies:--but to replace the under wings of the tetrapterous insects,\r\nthey are furnished with poisers, and numbers of them also with\r\nwinglets. The poisers (_Halteres_) are little membranaceous threads\r\nplaced one under the origin of each wing, near a spiracle, and\r\nterminated by an oval, round, or triangular button, which seems\r\ncapable of dilatation and contraction. The animal moves these organs\r\nwith great vivacity, often when at rest, and probably when flying.\r\nTheir winglets (_Alulæ_) are different from those of _Dytiscus\r\nmarginalis_, and the moth before noticed. Like them, they are of\r\nrigid membrane, and fringed; but they consist generally of two\r\nconcavo-convex pieces (sometimes surrounded by a nervure), situated\r\nbetween the wing and the poisers, which, when the insect reposes,\r\nfold over each other like the valves of a bivalve shell; but when it\r\nflies they are extended. The use of neither of these organs seems\r\nto have been satisfactorily ascertained. Dr. Derham thinks they are\r\nfor keeping the body steady in flight; and asserts, that if either\r\na poiser or winglet be cut off, the insect will fly as if one side\r\noverbalanced the other, till it falls to the ground; and that if\r\nboth be cut off, they will fly awkwardly and unsteadily, as if they\r\nhad lost some very necessary part[574]. Shelver cut off the winglets\r\nof a fly, leaving both wings and poisers, but it could no longer\r\nfly. He next cut off the poisers of another, leaving the wings and\r\nwinglets, and the same result followed. He found, upon removing one\r\nof these organs, that they were not properly compared to balancers.\r\nObserving that a common crane-fly (_Tipula crocata_) moved the knee\r\nof the hinder tibia in connexion with the wing and poiser, he cut\r\nit off, and it could no longer fly: this last experiment, however,\r\nseems contradicted by the fact, which has been often observed, that\r\nthe insects of this genus will fly when half their legs are gone. He\r\nafterwards cut off both its poisers, when it could neither fly nor\r\nwalk. Hence he conjectures that the poisers are connected with the\r\nfeet, and are air-holders[575]. I have often seen flies move their\r\npoisers very briskly when at rest, particularly _Seioptera vibrans_,\r\nbefore mentioned. This renders Shelver's conjecture--that they are\r\nconnected with respiration--not improbable. Perhaps by their action\r\nsome effect may be produced upon the spiracle in their vicinity,\r\neither as to the opening or closing of it.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of fliers in this order, the form of whose\r\nbodies, as well as the shape and circumstances of their wings, is\r\ndifferent. First are the slender flies--the gnats, gnat-like flies,\r\nand crane-flies (_Tipulariæ_). The bodies of these are light,\r\ntheir wings narrow, and their legs long, and they have no winglets.\r\nNext are those whose bodies, though slender, are more weighty--the\r\n_Asilidæ_, _Conopsidæ_, &c.; these have larger wings, shorter legs,\r\nand very minute and sometimes even obsolete winglets. Lastly come\r\nthe flies, the _Muscidæ_, &c., and their affinities, whose bodies\r\nbeing short, thick, and often very heavy, are furnished not only\r\nwith proportionate wings and shorter legs, but also with conspicuous\r\nwinglets. From these comparative differences and distinctions,\r\nwe may conjecture in the first place--since the lightest bodies\r\nare furnished with the longest legs, and the heaviest with the\r\nshortest--that the legs act as poisers and rudders, that keep\r\nthem steady while they fly, and assist them in directing their\r\ncourse[576]; and in the next--since the winglets are largest in the\r\nheaviest bodies, and altogether wanting in the lightest--that one of\r\ntheir principal uses is to assist the wings when the insect is flying.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the Tipularian genera is very various. Sometimes, as I\r\nhave observed, they fly up and down with a zigzag course; at others\r\nin vertical curves of small diameter, like some birds; at others,\r\nagain, in horizontal curves:--all these lines they describe with a\r\nkind of skipping motion. Sometimes they would seem to flit in every\r\npossible way--upwards, downwards, athwart, obliquely, and sometimes\r\nalmost in circles. The common gnat (_Culex pipiens_) seems to sail\r\nalong also in various directions. The motion of its wings, if it does\r\nnot fly like a hawk, is so rapid as not to be perceptible. When\r\nthe crane-fly (_Tipula oleracea_) is upon the wing, its fore-legs\r\nare placed horizontally, pointing forwards, and the four hind ones\r\nstretched out in an opposite direction, the one forming the prow and\r\nthe other the stern of the vessel, in its voyage through the ocean of\r\nair. The legs of another insect of this tribe (_Hirtæa Marci_) all\r\npoint towards the anus in flight, the long anterior pair forming an\r\nacute angle with the body:--thus, perhaps, it can better cut the air.\r\n\r\nI have often been amused in my walks with the motions of the\r\nhornet-fly (_Asilus crabroniformis_), belonging to the second\r\ndivision just mentioned. This insect is carnivorous, living upon\r\nsmall flies. When you are taking your rambles, you may often observe\r\nit alight just before you;--as soon as you come up, it flies a little\r\nfurther, and will thus be your avant-courier for the whole length\r\nof a long field. This usually takes place, I seem to have observed,\r\nwhen a path lies under a hedge; and perhaps the object of this\r\nmanœuvre may be the capture of prey. Your motions may drive a number\r\nof insects before you, and so be instrumental in supplying it with a\r\nmeal. Other species of the genus have the same habit.\r\n\r\nThe aërial progress of the fly tribes, including the gad-flies\r\n(_Œstridæ_); horse-flies (_Tabanidæ_); carrion-flies (_Muscidæ_),\r\nand many other genera--which constitute the heavy horse amongst\r\nour two-winged fliers--is wonderfully rapid, and usually in a\r\ndirect line. An anonymous observer in Nicholson's _Journal_[577]\r\ncalculates that, in its ordinary flight, the common house-fly (_Musca\r\ndomestica_) makes with its wings about 600 strokes, which carry it\r\nfive feet, every second. But if alarmed, he states their velocity\r\ncan be increased six- or seven-fold, or to thirty or thirty-five\r\nfeet, in the same period. In this space of time a race-horse could\r\nclear only ninety feet, which is at the rate of more than a mile in\r\na minute. Our little fly, in her swiftest flight, will in the same\r\nspace of time go more than the third of a mile. Now compare the\r\ninfinite difference of the size of the two animals (ten millions of\r\nthe fly would hardly counterpoise one racer), and how wonderful will\r\nthe velocity of this minute creature appear! Did the fly equal the\r\nrace-horse in size, and retain its present powers in the ratio of its\r\nmagnitude, it would traverse the globe with the rapidity of lightning.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, that it is not by muscular strength alone that many\r\ninsects are enabled to keep so long upon the wing. Every one who\r\nattends to them must have noticed, that the velocity and duration\r\nof their flights depend much upon the heat or coolness of the\r\natmosphere: especially the appearance of the sun. The warmer and\r\nmore unclouded his beam, the more insects are there upon the wing,\r\nand every diurnal species seems fitted for longer or more frequent\r\nexcursions. As these animals have no circulating fluid except the\r\nair in their tracheæ and bronchiæ, their locomotive powers, with few\r\nexceptions, must depend altogether upon the state of that element.\r\nWhen the thermometer descends below a certain point they become\r\ntorpid, and when it reaches a certain height they revive; so that\r\nthe air must be regarded, in some sense, as their blood, or rather\r\nthe caloric that it contains; which when conveyed by the air, it\r\ncirculates quickly in them, invigorates all their motions, enters\r\ninto the muscles and nervures of their wings, maintaining their\r\ntension, and by the greater or less rapidity of its pulsations\r\naccelerating or diminishing their action.\r\n\r\nHaving given you all the information that I can collect with respect\r\nto the motions of perfect insects in the _air_, I must next say\r\nsomething concerning their modes of locomotion in or upon the\r\n_water_. These are of two kinds, _swimming_ and _walking_. Observe--I\r\ncall that movement swimming, in which the animal pushes itself along\r\nby strokes--while in walking, the motion of the legs is not different\r\nfrom what it would be if they were on land. Most insects that _swim_\r\nhave their posterior legs peculiarly fitted for it, either by a\r\ndense fringe of hairs on the shank and foot, as in the water-beetles\r\n(_Dytiscus_)[578], or the water-boatmen (_Notonecta_); or by\r\nhaving their terminal joints very much dilated--as in the whirlwig\r\n(_Gyrinus_)--so as to resemble the paddle of an oar[579]. When the\r\nDytisci rise to the surface to take in fresh air--a silver bubble\r\nof which may often be seen suspended at their anus--they ascend, as\r\nit should seem, merely in consequence of their being specifically\r\nlighter than the water; but when they descend or move horizontally,\r\nwhich they do with considerable rapidity, it is by regular and\r\nsuccessive strokes of their swimming legs. While they remain\r\nsuspended at the surface, these legs are extended so as to form a\r\nright angle with their body. The water-boatmen swim upon their back,\r\nwhich enables them to see readily and seize the insects that fall\r\nupon the water, which are their prey. _Sigara_, however, a cognate\r\ngenus separated from _Notonecta_ by Fabricius, swims in the ordinary\r\nway. As the Gyrini are usually in motion at the surface, whirling\r\nround and round in circles, it is probable that their legs are best\r\nadapted to this movement. They dive down, however, with great ease\r\nand velocity when alarmed. The common water-bug (_Gerris lacustris_),\r\nthough it never goes under water, will sometimes swim upon the\r\nsurface, which it does by strokes of the intermediate and posterior\r\nlegs[580]. These, however, are neither fringed nor dilated, but very\r\nlong and slender, with claws, not easily detected, situated under\r\nthe apex of the last joint of the foot, which covers and conceals\r\nthem. The underside of their body--as is the case with _Elophorus_,\r\nand many other aquatic insects--is clothed with a thick coat of gray\r\nhairs like satin, which in certain lights have no small degree of\r\nlustre, and protect its body from the effects of the water. Some\r\ninsects, that are not naturally aquatic, if they fall into the water\r\nwill swim very well. I once saw a kind of grasshopper (_Acrydium_),\r\nwhich by the powerful strokes of its hind legs pushed itself across a\r\nstream with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nOther insects _walk_, as it were, in the water, moving their legs\r\nmuch in the same way as they would do on the land. Many smaller\r\nspecies of water-beetles, belonging to the genera _Hydrophilus_,\r\n_Elophorus_, _Hydræna_, _Parnus_, _Limnius_, &c. thus win their way\r\nin the waves.--Thus also the water-scorpion (_Nepa_) pursues its\r\nprey; and the little water-mites (_Hydrachna_) may be seen in every\r\npool thus working their little legs with great rapidity, and moving\r\nabout in all directions.--Some spiders also will not only traverse\r\nthe surface of the waters, but, as you have heard with respect to\r\none[581], descend into their bosom. There are other insects moving\r\nin this way that are not divers. Of this kind are the aquatic bugs\r\n(_Gerris lacustris_, _Hydrometra Stagnorum_, _Velia Rivulorum_, &c.\r\nLatr.). The first can walk, run, and even leap, which it does upon\r\nits prey, as well as swim upon the surface. The second, remarkable\r\nfor its extreme slenderness, and for its prominent hemispherical\r\neyes--which, though they are really in the head, appear to be in\r\nthe middle of the body--rambles about in chase of other insects, in\r\nconsiderable numbers, in most stagnant waters. The _Velia_ is to be\r\nmet with chiefly in running streams and rivers, coursing very rapidly\r\nover their waves[582]. The two last species neither jump nor swim.\r\n\r\nI am next to say a few words upon the motions of insects that\r\n_burrow_, either to conceal themselves or their young. Though\r\nburrowing is not always a locomotion, I shall consider it under this\r\nhead, to preserve the unity of the subject. Many enter the earth by\r\nmeans of fore-legs particularly formed for the purpose. The flat\r\ndentated anterior shanks, with slender feet, that distinguish the\r\nchafers (_Petalocera_)--most of which in their first states live\r\nunder ground, and many occasionally in their last--enable them to\r\nmake their way either into the earth or out of it. Two other genera\r\nof beetles (_Scarites_ and _Clivina_, Latr.)[583] have these shanks\r\npalmated, or armed with longer teeth at their extremity, for the\r\nsame purpose. But the most remarkable burrower amongst perfect\r\ninsects is that singular animal the mole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa\r\nvulgaris_)[584]. This creature is endowed with wonderful strength,\r\nparticularly in its thorax and fore legs. The former is a very hard\r\nand solid shell or crust, covering like a shield the trunk of the\r\nanimal; and the latter are remarkably fitted for burrowing, both\r\nby their strength and construction. The shanks are very broad, and\r\nterminate obliquely in four enormous sharp teeth[585], like so many\r\nfingers: the foot consists of three joints--the two first being\r\nbroad and tooth-shaped, and pointing in an opposite direction to the\r\nteeth of the shank; and the last small, and armed at the extremity\r\nwith two short claws. This foot is placed inside the shank, so as to\r\nresemble a thumb and perform the office of one[586]. The direction\r\nand motion of these hands, as in moles, is outwards; thus enabling\r\nthe animal most effectually to remove the earth when it burrows.\r\nBy the help of these powerful instruments, it is astonishing how\r\ninstantaneously it buries itself. This creature works under ground\r\nlike a field-mouse, raising a ridge as it goes; but it does not\r\nthrow up heaps like its name-sake the mole. They will in this manner\r\nundermine whole gardens; and thus in wet and swampy situations, in\r\nwhich they delight, they excavate their curious apartments, before\r\ndescribed. The field-cricket (_Gryllus campestris_) is also a\r\nburrower, but by means of different instruments; for with its strong\r\njaws, toothed like the claws of a lobster, but sharper, in heaths and\r\nother dry situations it perforates and rounds its curious and regular\r\ncells. The house-cricket (_G. domesticus_), which, on account of the\r\nsoftness of the mortar, delights in new-built houses, with the same\r\norgans, to make herself a covered-way from room to room, burrows and\r\nmines between the joints of the bricks and stones[587].\r\n\r\nBut of all the burrowing tribes, none are so numerous as those\r\nof the order _Hymenoptera_. Wherever you see a bare bank, of a\r\nsunny exposure, you always find it full of the habitations of\r\ninsects belonging to it;--and besides this, every rail and old\r\npiece of timber is with the same view perforated by them. Bees;\r\nwasps; bee-wasps (_Bembex_); spider-wasps (_Pompilus_); fly-wasps\r\n(_Mellinus_, _Cerceris_, _Crabro_), with many others, excavate\r\nsubterranean or ligneous habitations for their young. None is more\r\nremarkable in this respect than the sand-wasp (_Ammophila_), or\r\nas it might be better named--since it always commits its eggs to\r\ncaterpillars which it inhumes--the caterpillar-wasp. It digs its\r\nburrows, by scratching with its fore legs like a dog or a rabbit,\r\ndispersing with its hind ones, which are particularly constructed for\r\nthat purpose, the sand so collected[588].\r\n\r\nSince most of these burrows are designed for the reception of the eggs\r\nof the burrowers, I shall next describe to you the manner in which\r\none of the long-legged gnats, or crane-flies (_Tipula variegata_,)--a\r\nproceeding to which I was myself a witness--oviposits. Choosing a south\r\nbank bare of grass, she stood with her legs stretched out on each side,\r\nand kept turning herself half round backwards and forwards alternately.\r\nThus the ovipositor, which terminates her long cylindrical pointed\r\nabdomen, made its way into the hard soil, and deposited her eggs in a\r\nsecure situation. All, however, were not committed to the same burrow;\r\nfor she every now and then shifted her station, but not more than an\r\ninch from where she bored last. While she was thus engaged, I observed\r\nher male companion suspended by one of his legs on a twig, not far from\r\nher. The common turf-boring crane-fly (_T. oleracea_), when engaged in\r\nlaying eggs, moves over the grass with her body in a vertical position,\r\nby the help--her four anterior legs being in the air--of her two\r\nposterior ones, and the end of her abdomen, which performs the office\r\nof another. Whether in boring, like _T. variegata_, she turns half\r\nround and back, does not appear from Reaumur's account[589].\r\n\r\nI now come to motions whose object seems to be _sport_ and amusement\r\nrather than locomotion. They may be considered as of three\r\nkinds--hovering--gyrations--and dancing.\r\n\r\nYou have often in the woods and other places seen flies suspended\r\nas it were in the air, their wings all the while moving so rapidly\r\nas to be almost invisible. This _hovering_, which seems peculiar to\r\nthe aphidivorous flies, has been also noticed by De Geer[590]. I\r\nhave frequently amused myself with watching them; but when I have\r\nendeavoured to entrap them with my forceps, they have immediately\r\nshifted their quarters, and resumed their amusement elsewhere. The\r\nmost remarkable insects in this respect are the sphinxes, and from\r\nthis they doubtless took their name of _hawk-moths_. When they unfold\r\ntheir long tongue, and wipe its sweets from any nectariferous flower,\r\nthey always keep upon the wing, suspending themselves over it till\r\nthey have exhausted them, when they fly away to another. The species\r\ncalled by collectors the humming-bird (_Macroglossa Stellatarum_),\r\nand by some persons mistaken for a real one, is remarkable for this,\r\nand the motion of its wings is inconceivably rapid[591].\r\n\r\nThe _gyrations_ of insects take place either when they are reposing,\r\nor when they are flying or swimming.--I was once much diverted by\r\nobserving the actions of a minute moth upon a leaf on which it was\r\nstationed. Making its head the centre of its revolutions, it turned\r\nround and round with considerable rapidity, as if it had the vertigo,\r\nfor some time. I did not, however, succeed in my attempts to take\r\nit.--Scaliger noticed a similar motion in the book-crab (_Chelifer\r\ncancroides_)[592].\r\n\r\nReaumur describes in a very interesting and lively way the gyrations\r\nof the Ephemeræ before noticed[593], round a lighted flambeau. It is\r\nsingular, says he, that moths which fly only in the night, and shun\r\nthe day, should be precisely those that come to seek the light in our\r\napartments. It is still more extraordinary that these Ephemeræ--which\r\nappearing after sunset, and dying before sun-rise, are destined never\r\nto behold the light of that orb--should have so strong an inclination\r\nfor any luminous object. To hold a flambeau when they appeared was no\r\nvery pleasant office; for he who filled it, in a few seconds had his\r\ndress covered with the insects, which rushed from all quarters to him.\r\nThe light of the flambeau exhibited a spectacle which enchanted every\r\none that beheld it. All that were present, even the most ignorant\r\nand stupid of his domestics, were never satisfied with looking at\r\nit. Never had any armillary sphere so many zones, as there were here\r\ncircles, which had the light for their centre. There was an infinity of\r\nthem--crossing each other in all directions, and of every imaginable\r\ninclination--all of which were more or less eccentric. Each zone was\r\ncomposed of an unbroken string of Ephemeræ, resembling a piece of\r\nsilver lace formed into a circle deeply notched, and consisting of\r\nequal triangles placed end to end (so that one of the angles of that\r\nwhich followed touched the middle of the base of that which preceded),\r\nand moving with astonishing rapidity. The wings of the flies, which was\r\nall of them that could then be distinguished, formed this appearance.\r\nEach of these creatures, after having described one or two orbits,\r\nfell upon the earth or into the water, but not in consequence of being\r\nburned[594]. Reaumur was one of the most accurate of observers; and\r\nyet I suspect that the appearance he describes was a visual deception,\r\nand for the following reason. I was once walking in the day-time with\r\na friend[595], when our attention was caught by myriads of small\r\nflies, which were dancing under every tree;--viewed in a certain light\r\nthey appeared a concatenated series of insects (as Reaumur has here\r\ndescribed his Ephemeræ) moving in a spiral direction upwards;--but\r\neach series upon close examination, we found was produced by the\r\nastonishingly rapid movement of a single fly. Indeed, when we consider\r\nthe space that a fly will pass through in a second, it is not wonderful\r\nthat the eye should be unable to trace its gradual progress, or that it\r\nshould appear present in the whole space at the same instant. The fly\r\nwe saw was a small male Ichneumon.\r\n\r\nOther circular motions of sportive insects take place in the waters.\r\nLinné, in his Lapland tour, noticed a black Tipula which ran over the\r\nwater, and turned round like a whirlwig, or _Gyrinus_[596]. This last\r\ninsect I have often mentioned;--it seems the merriest and most agile of\r\nall the inhabitants of the waves. Wonderful is the velocity with which\r\nthey turn round and round, as it were pursuing each other in incessant\r\ncircles, sometimes moving in oblique, and indeed in every other\r\ndirection. Now and then they repose on the surface, as if fatigued with\r\ntheir dances, and desirous of enjoying the full effect of the sun-beam:\r\nif you approach they are instantaneously in motion again. Attempt to\r\nentrap them with your net, and they are under the water and dispersed\r\nin a moment. When the danger ceases they reappear, and resume their\r\nvagaries. Covered with lucid armour, when the sun shines they look like\r\nlittle dancing masses of silver or brilliant pearls[597].\r\n\r\nBut the motions of this kind to which I particularly wish to call\r\nyour attention, are the choral dances of males in the air; for the\r\ndancing sex amongst insects is the masculine, the ladies generally\r\nkeeping themselves quiet at home. These dances occur at all seasons\r\nof the year, both in winter and summer, though in the former\r\nseason they are confined to the hardy Tipulariæ. In the morning\r\nbefore twelve, the _Hopliæ_, root-beetles before mentioned, have\r\ntheir dances in the air, and the solstitial and common cockchafer\r\nappear in the evening--the former generally coming forth at the\r\nsummer solstice--and fill the air over the trees and hedges with\r\ntheir myriads and their hum. Other dancing insects resemble moving\r\ncolumns--each individual rising and falling in a vertical line a\r\ncertain space, and which will follow the passing traveller--often\r\nintent upon other business, and all unconscious of his aërial\r\ncompanions--for a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nTowards sun-set the common Ephemeræ (_E. vulgata_), distinguished\r\nby their spotted wings and three long tails (_Caudulæ_), commence\r\ntheir dances in the meadows near the rivers. They assemble in\r\ntroops, consisting sometimes of several hundreds, and keep rising\r\nand falling continually, usually over some high tree. They rise\r\nbeating the air rapidly with their wings, till they have ascended\r\nfive or six feet above the tree; then they descend to it with their\r\nwings extended and motionless, sailing like hawks, and having their\r\nthree tails elevated, and the lateral ones so separated as to form\r\nnearly a right angle with the central one. These tails seem given\r\nthem to balance their bodies when they descend, which they do in a\r\nhorizontal position. This motion continues two or three hours without\r\nceasing, and commences in fine clear weather about an hour before\r\nsun-set, lasting till the copious falling of the dew compels them to\r\nretire to their nocturnal station[598]. Our most common species,\r\nwhich I have usually taken for the _E. vulgata_, varies from that of\r\nDe Geer in its proceedings. I found them at the end of May dancing\r\nover the meadows, not over the trees, at a much earlier hour--at\r\nhalf-past three--rising in the way just described, about a foot, and\r\nthen descending, at the distance of about four or five feet from the\r\nground. Another species, common here, rises seven or eight feet.\r\nI have also seen Ephemeræ flying over the water in a horizontal\r\ndirection. The females are sometimes in the air, when the males seize\r\nthem, and they fly paired. These insects seem to use their fore-legs\r\nto break the air; they are applied together before the head, and look\r\nlike antennæ.--_Hilara maura_, a little beaked fly, I have observed\r\nrushing in infinite numbers like a shower of rain driven by the wind,\r\nas before observed[599], over waters, and then returning back.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the smaller _Tipulariæ_ will fly unwetted in\r\na heavy shower of rain, as I have often observed. How keen must be\r\ntheir sight, and how rapid their motions, to enable them to steer\r\nbetween drops bigger than their own bodies, which, if they fell upon\r\nthem, must dash them to the ground!\r\n\r\nAmidst this infinite variety of motions, for purposes so numerous and\r\ndiversified, and performed by such a multiplicity of instruments and\r\norgans, who does not discern and adore the Great FIRST MOVER? From\r\nhim all proceed, by him all are endowed, in him all move: and it is\r\nto accomplish his ends, and to go on his errands, that these little\r\nbut not insignificant beings are thus gifted; since it is by them\r\nthat he maintains this terraqueous globe in order and beauty, thus\r\nrendering it fit for the residence of his creature man.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[468] Peck in _Linn. Trans._ xi. 92.\r\n\r\n[469] Meigen considers this as an _Ortalis_; but its peculiar habit\r\nof constantly vibrating its wings indicates a distinct genus:\r\nespecially as the habit is not confined to a single species.\r\n\r\n[470] De Geer, vi. 335.\r\n\r\n[471] See above, p. 234.\r\n\r\n[472] The most common number of joints in the tarsus is from two to\r\nfive; but the Phalangidæ have sometimes more than forty. In these,\r\nunder a lens, this part looks like a jointed antenna.\r\n\r\nGeoffroy, and after him most modern entomologists, has taken the\r\n_primary_ divisions of the _Coleoptera_ order from the number of\r\njoints in the tarsus; but this, although perhaps in the majority\r\nof cases it may afford a natural division, will not universally.\r\nFor--not to mention the instance of _Pselaphus_, clearly belonging to\r\nthe _Brachyptera_--both _Oxytelus_, Grav., and another genus that I\r\nhave separated from it (_Carpalimus_, K. Ms.), have only two joints\r\nin their tarsi. In this tribe, therefore, it can only be used for\r\nsecondary divisions.--K.\r\n\r\n[473] iii. 284.\r\n\r\n[474] _Hist.

St. Pierre mentions one not longer\r\nthan a finger, that, in the Isle of France, climbs along the walls,\r\nand even up the glass after the flies and other insects, for which\r\nit watches with great patience. These lizards are sometimes so tame\r\nthat they will feed out of the hand.--_Voyage_, &c. 73. Major Moor\r\nand Captain Green observed similar lizards in India, that ran up the\r\nwalls and over the ceilings after the mosquitos. Hasselquist says\r\nthat the Gecko is very frequent at Cairo, both in the houses and\r\nwithout them, and that it exhales a very deleterious poison from the\r\nlobuli between the toes. He saw two women and a girl at the point\r\nof death, merely from eating a cheese on which it had dropped its\r\nvenom. One ran over the hand of a man, who endeavoured to catch\r\nit; and immediately little pustules, resembling those occasioned\r\nby the stinging-nettle, rose all over the parts the creature had\r\ntouched.--_Voyage_, 220. M. Savigny, however, who examined this\r\nanimal in Egypt, assures me that this account of Hasselquist's, as\r\nfar as it relates to the venom of the Gecko, is not correct.\r\n\r\n[502] _Philos.

If by voice we understand sounds\r\nproduced by the air expelled from the lungs, which, passing through\r\nthe larynx, is modified by the tongue, and emitted from the mouth,--it\r\nis even so. For no insect, like the larger animals, uses its mouth for\r\nutterance of any kind: in this respect they are all perfectly mute; and\r\nthough incessantly noisy, are everlastingly silent. Of this fact the\r\nStagyrite was not ignorant, since, denying them a voice, he attributes\r\nthe sounds emitted by insects to another cause. But if we feel disposed\r\nto give a larger extent to this word; if we are of opinion that all\r\nsounds, however produced, by means of which animals determine those of\r\ntheir own species to certain actions, merit the name of voice; then I\r\nwill grant that insects have a voice. But, decide this question as we\r\nwill, we all know that by some means or other, at certain seasons and\r\non various occasions, these little creatures make a great din in the\r\nworld. I must therefore now bespeak your attention to this department\r\nof their history.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this subject, I shall consider the noises insects\r\nemit--during their motions--when they are feeding, or otherwise\r\nemployed--when they are calling or commanding--or when they are under\r\nthe influence of the passions; of fear, of anger, of sorrow, joy, or\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nThe only kind of _locomotion_ during which these animals produce\r\nsounds, is flying: for though the hill-ants (_Formica rufa_), as I\r\nformerly observed[600], make a rustling noise with their feet when\r\nwalking over dry leaves, I know of no other insect the tread of which\r\nis accompanied by sound--except indeed the flea, whose steps, a\r\nlady assures me, she always hears when it paces over her night-cap,\r\nand that it clicks as if it was walking in pattens! That the flight\r\nof numbers of insects is attended by a humming or booming is known\r\nto almost every one; but that the great majority move through the\r\nair in silence, has not perhaps been so often observed. Generally\r\nspeaking, those that fly with the most force and rapidity, and with\r\nwings seemingly motionless, make the most noise; while those that fly\r\ngently and leisurely, and visibly fan the air with their wings, yield\r\nlittle or no sound.\r\n\r\nAmongst the beetle tribes (_Coleoptera_), none is more noticed, or\r\nmore celebrated for \"wheeling its droning flight,\" than the common\r\ndung-chafer (_Geotrupes stercorarius_) and its affinities. Linné\r\naffirms--but the prognostic sometimes fails--that when these insects\r\nfly in numbers, it indicates a subsequent fine day[601]. The truth\r\nis, they only fly in fine weather. Mr. White has remarked, that in\r\nthe dusk of the evening beetles begin to buz, and that partridges\r\nbegin to call exactly at the same time[602]. The common cock chafer,\r\nand that which appears at the summer solstice (_Melolontha vulgaris_\r\nand _Amphimalla solstitialis_), when they hover over the summits of\r\ntrees in numbers, produce a hum somewhat resembling that of bees\r\nswarming. Perhaps some insect of this kind may occasion the humming\r\nin the air mentioned by Mr. White, and which you and I have often\r\nheard in other places. \"There is,\" says he, \"a natural occurrence to\r\nbe met with in the highest part of our down on the hot summer days,\r\nwhich always amuses me much, without giving me any satisfaction with\r\nrespect to the cause of it;--and that is a loud audible humming of\r\nbees in the air, though not one insect is to be seen.--Any person\r\nwould suppose that a large swarm of bees was in motion, and playing\r\nabout over his head[603].\"\r\n\r\n          \"Resounds the living surface of the ground--\r\n           Nor undelightful is the ceaseless hum\r\n           To him who muses through the woods at noon,\r\n           Or drowsy shepherd as he lies reclined.\"\r\n\r\nThe hotter the weather, the higher insects will soar; and it is\r\nnot improbable that the sound produced by numbers may be heard,\r\nwhen those that produce it are out of sight.--The burying-beetle\r\n(_Necrophorus Vespillo_), whose singular history[604] so much amused\r\nyou, as well as _Cicindela sylvatica_ of the same order, flies\r\nlikewise, as I have more than once witnessed, with a considerable hum.\r\n\r\nWhether the innumerable locust armies, to which I have so often called\r\nyour attention, make any noise in their flight, I have not been able\r\nto ascertain; the mere impulse of the wings of myriads and myriads\r\nof these creatures upon the air, must, one would think, produce some\r\nsound. In the symbolical locusts mentioned in the Apocalypse[605], this\r\nis compared to the sound of chariots rushing to battle: an illustration\r\nwhich the inspired author of that book would scarcely have had recourse\r\nto, if the real locusts winged their way in silence.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Hemiptera_, I know only a single species that is of noisy\r\nflight; though doubtless, were the attention of entomologists directed\r\nto that object, others would be found exhibiting the same peculiarity.\r\nThe insect I allude to (_Coreus marginatus_) is one of the numerous\r\ntribe of bugs; when flying, especially when hovering together in a\r\nsunny sheltered spot, they emit a hum as loud as that of the hive-bee.\r\n\r\nFrom the magnitude and strength of their wings, it might be supposed\r\nthat many _lepidopterous_ insects would not be silent in their\r\nflight;--and indeed many of the hawk-moths (_Sphinx_, F.), and some\r\nof the larger moths (_Bombyx_, F.), are not so; _Cossus ligniperda_,\r\nfor instance, is said to emulate the booming of beetles by means\r\nof its large stiff wings; whence in Germany it is called the\r\nhumming-bird (_Brumm-Vogel_).--But the great body of these numerous\r\ntribes, even those that fan the air with \"sail-broad vans,\" produce\r\nlittle or no sound by their motion. I must therefore leave them,\r\nas well as the _Trichoptera_ and _Neuroptera_, which are equally\r\nbarren of insects of sounding wing--and proceed to an order, the\r\n_Hymenoptera_, in which the insects that compose it are, many of\r\nthem, of more fame for this property.\r\n\r\nThe indefatigable hive-bee, as she flies from flower to flower,\r\namuses the observer with her hum, which, though monotonous, pleases\r\nby exciting the idea of happy industry, that wiles the toils of\r\nlabour with a song. When she alights upon a flower, and is engaged in\r\ncollecting its sweets, her hum ceases; but it is resumed again the\r\nmoment that she leaves it.--The wasp and hornet also are strenuous\r\nhummers; and when they enter our apartments, their hum often brings\r\nterror with it. But the most sonorous fliers of this order are the\r\nlarger humble-bees, whose _bombination_, _booming_, or _bombing_, may\r\nbe heard from a considerable distance, gradually increasing as the\r\nanimal approaches you, and when, in its wheeling flight, it rudely\r\npasses close to your ear, almost stunning you by its sharp, shrill,\r\nand deafening sound. Many genera, however, of this order fly silently.\r\n\r\nBut the noisiest wings belong to insects of the _dipterous_ order,\r\na majority of which, probably, give notice of their approach by\r\nthe sound of their trumpets. Most of those, however, that have a\r\nslender body,--the gnat genus (_Culex_) excepted,--explore the air\r\nin silence. Of this description are the _Tipulariæ_, the _Asilidæ_,\r\nthe genus _Empis_, and their affinities. The rest are more or less\r\ninsects of a humming flight; and with respect to many of them, their\r\nhum is a sound of terror and dismay to those who hear it. To man, the\r\ntrumpet of the gnat or mosquito; and to beasts, that of the gad-fly;\r\nof various kinds of horse-flies; and of the Ethiopian zimb, as I have\r\nbefore related at large[606], is the signal of intolerable annoyance.\r\nHomer, in his _Batrachomyomachia_, long ago celebrated the first of\r\nthese as a trumpeter--\r\n\r\n          \"For their sonorous trumpets far renown'd,\r\n           Of battle the dire charge mosquitos sound.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pope, in his translation, with his usual inaccuracy, thinking no\r\ndoubt to improve upon his author, has turned the old bard's gnats\r\ninto hornets. In Guiana these animals are distinguished by a name\r\nstill more tremendous, being called the devil's trumpeters[607]. I\r\nhave observed that early in the spring, before their thirst for blood\r\nseizes them, gnats when flying emit no sound. At this moment (Feb.\r\n18) two females are flying about my windows in perfect silence.\r\n\r\nAfter this short account of insects that give notice when they are\r\nupon the wing by the sounds that precede them, I must inquire by\r\nwhat means these sounds are produced. Ordinarily, except perhaps in\r\nthe case of the gnat, they seem perfectly independent of the will of\r\nthe animal; and in almost every instance, the sole instruments that\r\ncause the noise of flying insects are their wings, or some parts\r\nnear to them, which, by their friction against the trunk, occasion\r\na vibration--as the fingers upon the strings of a guitar--yielding\r\na sound more or less acute in proportion to the rapidity of their\r\nflight--the action of the air perhaps upon these organs giving it\r\nsome modifications. Whether, in the beetles that fly with noise,\r\nthe elytra contribute more or less to produce it, seems not to have\r\nbeen clearly ascertained: yet, since they fly with force as well as\r\nvelocity, the action of the air may cause some motion in them, enough\r\nto occasion friction. With respect to _Diptera_, Latreille contends\r\nthat the noise of flies on the wing cannot be the result of friction,\r\nbecause their wings are then expanded; but though to us flies seem\r\nto sail through the air without moving these organs, yet they are\r\ndoubtless all the while in motion, though too rapid for the eye to\r\nperceive it. When the aphidivorous flies are hovering, the vertical\r\nplay of their wings, though very rapid, is easily seen; but when they\r\nfly off it is no longer visible. Repeated experiments have been tried\r\nto ascertain the cause of sound in this tribe, but it should seem\r\nwith different results. De Geer, whose observations were made upon\r\none of the flies just mentioned, appears to have proved that, in the\r\ninsect he examined, the sounds were produced by the friction of the\r\nroot or base of the wings against the sides of the cavity in which\r\nthey are inserted. To be convinced of this, he affirms, the observer\r\nhas nothing to do but to hold each wing with the finger and thumb,\r\nand stretching them out, taking care not to hurt the animal, in\r\nopposite directions, thus to prevent their motion,--and immediately\r\nall sound will cease. For further satisfaction he made the following\r\nexperiment. He first cut off the wings of one of these flies very\r\nnear the base; but finding that it still continued to buz as before,\r\nhe thought that the winglets and poisers, which he remarked were in\r\na constant vibration, might occasion the sound. Upon this, cutting\r\nboth off, he examined the mutilated fly with a microscope, and found\r\nthat the remaining fragments of the wings were in constant motion all\r\nthe time that the buzzing continued; but that upon pulling them up\r\nby the roots all sound ceased[608]. Shelver's experiments, noticed\r\nin my last letter, go to prove, with respect to the insects that he\r\nexamined, that the winglets are more particularly concerned with the\r\nbuzzing. Upon cutting off the wings of a fly--but he does not state\r\nthat he pulled them up by the roots--he found the sound continued.\r\nHe next cut off the poisers--the buzzing went on. This experiment\r\nwas repeated eighteen times with the same result. Lastly, when he\r\ntook off the winglets, either wholly or partially, the buzzing\r\nceased. This, however, if correct, can only be a cause of this noise\r\nin the insects that have winglets. Numbers have them not. He next,\r\ntherefore, cut off the poisers of a crane-fly (_Tipula crocata_),\r\nand found that it buzzed when it moved the wing. He cut off half the\r\nlatter, yet still the sound continued; but when he had cut off the\r\nwhole of these organs the sound entirely ceased[609].\r\n\r\nAristophanes in his _Clouds_, deriding Socrates, introduces Chærephon\r\nas asking that philosopher whether gnats made their buz with their\r\nmouth or their tail[610]. Upon which Mouffet very gravely observes,\r\nthat the sound of one of these insects approaching is much more acute\r\nthan that of one retiring; from whence he very sapiently concludes,\r\nthat not the tail but the mouth must be their organ of sound[611].\r\nBut after all, the friction of the base of the wings against the\r\nthorax seems to be the sole cause of the alarming buz of the gnat as\r\nwell as that of other _Diptera_. The warmer the weather, the greater\r\nis their thirst for blood, the more forcible their flight, the motion\r\nof their wings more rapid, and the sound produced by that motion more\r\nintense. In the night--but perhaps this may arise from the universal\r\nstillness that then reigns--their hum appears louder than in the day:\r\nwhence its tones may seem to be modified by the will of the animal.\r\n\r\nSounds also are sometimes emitted by insects when they are _feeding_\r\nor otherwise _employed_. The action of the jaws of a large number of\r\ncockchafers produces a noise resembling the sawing of timber; that\r\nof the locusts has been compared to the crackling of a flame of fire\r\ndriven by the wind; indeed the collision at the same instant of myriads\r\nof millions of their powerful jaws must be attended by a considerable\r\nsound. The timber-borers also--the _Buprestes_; the stag-horn beetles;\r\nand particularly the capricorn-beetles--the mandibles of whose larvæ\r\nresemble a pair of mill-stones[612]--most probably do not feed in\r\nsilence. A little wood-louse (_Atropos pulsatoria_)--which on that\r\naccount has been confounded with the death-watch--is said also, when\r\nso engaged, to emit a ticking noise.--Certain two-winged flies seen\r\nin spring, distinguished by a very long proboscis (_Bombylius_), hum\r\nall the time that they suck the honey from the flowers; as do also\r\nmany hawk-moths, particularly that called from this circumstance the\r\nhumming-bird (_Macroglossa Stellatarum_), which, while it hovers\r\nover them, unfolding its long tongue, pilfers their sweets without\r\ninterrupting its song.--The giant cock-roach (_Blatta gigantea_), which\r\nabounds in old timber houses in the warmer parts of the world, makes a\r\nnoise when the family are asleep like a pretty smart rapping with the\r\nknuckles--three or four sometimes appearing to answer each other.--On\r\nthis account in the West Indies it is called the _Drummer_; and they\r\nsometimes beat such a reveille, that only good sleepers can rest for\r\nthem[613]. As the animals of this genus generally come forth in the\r\nnight for the purpose of feeding, this noise is probably connected with\r\nthat subject.\r\n\r\nInsects also, at least many of the social ones, emit peculiar noises\r\nwhile engaged in their various _employments_. If an ear be applied to\r\na wasps or humble-bees nest, or a bee-hive, a hum more or less intense\r\nmay always be perceived. Were I disposed to play upon your credulity,\r\nI might tell you, with Gœdart, that in every humble-bees nest there\r\nis a trumpeter, who early in the morning, ascending to its summit,\r\nvibrates his wings, and sounding his trumpet for the space of a quarter\r\nof an hour, rouses the inhabitants to work! But since Reaumur could\r\nnever witness this, I shall not insist upon your believing it, though\r\nthe relater declares that he had heard it with his ears, and seen\r\nit with his eyes, and had called many to witness the vibrating and\r\nstrepent wings of this trumpeter humble-bee[614].--The blue sand-wasp\r\n(_Ammophila? cyanea_), which at all other times is silent, when engaged\r\nin building its cells emits a singular but pleasing sound, which may be\r\nheard at ten or twelve yards distance[615].\r\n\r\nSome insects also are remarkable for a peculiar mode of _calling_,\r\n_commanding_, or giving an _alarm_. I have before mentioned the noise\r\nmade by the neuters or soldiers amongst the white ants, by which\r\nthey keep the labourers, who answer it by a hiss, upon the alert\r\nand to their work[616]. This noise, which is produced by striking\r\nany substance with their mandibles, Smeathman describes as a small\r\nvibrating sound, rather shriller and quicker than the ticking of\r\na watch. It could be distinguished, he says, at the distance of\r\nthree or four feet, and continued for a minute at a time with very\r\nshort intervals. When any one walks in a solitary grove, where the\r\ncovered ways of these insects abound, they give the alarm by a loud\r\nhissing, which is heard at every step[617].--\"When house-crickets\r\nare out,\" says Mr. White, \"and running about in a room in the night,\r\nif surprised by a candle they give two or three shrill notes, as it\r\nwere for a signal to their followers, that they may escape to their\r\ncrannies and lurking-holes to avoid danger[618].\"\r\n\r\nUnder this head I shall consider a noise before alluded to[619],\r\nwhich has been a cause of alarm and terror to the superstitious in\r\nall ages. You will perceive that I am speaking of the death-watch--so\r\ncalled, because it emits a sound resembling the ticking of a watch,\r\nsupposed to predict the death of some one of the family in the house\r\nin which it is heard. Thus sings the muse of the witty Dean of St.\r\nPatrick on this subject:\r\n\r\n                    \"..................A wood-worm\r\n          That lies in old wood, like a hare in her form:\r\n          With teeth or with claws it will bite or will scratch,\r\n          And chambermaids christen this worm a death-watch;\r\n          Because like a watch it always cries click;\r\n          Then woe be to those in the house who are sick!\r\n          For, sure as a gun, they will give up the ghost,\r\n          If the maggot cries click, when it scratches the post;\r\n          But a kettle of scalding hot water injected,\r\n          Infallibly cures the timber affected:\r\n          The omen is broken, the danger is over,\r\n          The maggot will die, and the sick will recover.\"\r\n\r\nTo add to the effect of this noise, it is said to be made only when\r\nthere is a profound silence in an apartment, and every one is still.\r\n\r\nAuthors were formerly not agreed concerning the insect from which\r\nthis sound of terror proceeded, some attributing it to a kind of\r\nwood-louse, as I lately observed, and others to a spider; but it is\r\na received opinion now, adopted upon satisfactory evidence, that it\r\nis produced by some little beetles belonging to the timber-boring\r\ngenus _Anobium_. Swammerdam observes, that a small beetle, which\r\nhe had in his collection, having firmly fixed its fore legs, and\r\nput its inflexed head between them, makes a continual noise in old\r\npieces of wood, walls, and ceilings, which is sometimes so loud,\r\nthat upon hearing it, people have fancied that hobgoblins, ghosts,\r\nor fairies were wandering around them[620]. Evidently this was one\r\nof the death-watches. Latreille observed _Anobium striatum_ produce\r\nthe sound in question by a stroke of its mandibles upon the wood,\r\nwhich was answered by a similar noise from within it. But the species\r\nwhose proceedings have been most noticed by British observers is _A.\r\ntessellatum_. When spring is far advanced, these insects are said to\r\ncommence their ticking, which is only a call to each other, to which\r\nif no answer be returned, the animal repeats it in another place. It\r\nis thus produced. Raising itself upon its hind legs, with the body\r\nsomewhat inclined, it beats its head with great force and agility\r\nupon the plane of position; and its strokes are so powerful as to\r\nmake a considerable impression if they fall upon any substance softer\r\nthan wood. The general number of distinct strokes in succession is\r\nfrom seven to nine or eleven. They follow each other quickly, and are\r\nrepeated at uncertain intervals. In old houses, where these insects\r\nabound, they may be heard in warm weather during the whole day. The\r\nnoise exactly resembles that produced by tapping moderately with the\r\nnail upon the table; and when familiarized, the insect will answer\r\nvery readily the tap of the nail[621].\r\n\r\nThe queen bee has long been celebrated for a peculiar sound, producing\r\nthe most extraordinary effects upon her subjects. Sometimes, just\r\nbefore bees swarm,--instead of the great hum usually heard, and\r\neven in the night,--if the ear be placed close to the mouth of the\r\nhive, a sharp clear sound may be distinguished, which appears to be\r\nproduced by the vibration of the wings of a single bee. This, it has\r\nbeen pretended, is the harangue of the new queen to her subjects, to\r\ninspire them with courage to achieve the foundation of a new empire.\r\nBut Butler gives to it a different interpretation. He asserts, that\r\nthe candidate for the new throne is then with earnest entreaties,\r\nlamentations, and groans, supplicating the queen-mother of the hive\r\nto grant her permission to lead the intended colony;--that this is\r\ncontinued, before she can obtain her consent, for two days; when the\r\nold queen relenting gives her fiat in a fuller and stronger tone. That\r\nshould the former presume to imitate the tones of the sovereign, this\r\nbeing the signal of revolt, she would be executed on the spot, with\r\nall whom she had seduced from their loyalty[622].--But it is time to\r\nleave fables: I shall therefore next relate to you what really takes\r\nplace. You have heard how the bees detain their young queens till they\r\nare fit to lead a swarm.--I then mentioned the attitude and sound that\r\nstrike the former motionless[623]. When she emits this authoritative\r\nsound, reclining her thorax against a comb, the queen stands with her\r\nwings crossed upon her back, which, without being uncrossed or further\r\nexpanded, are kept in constant vibration. The tone thus produced is a\r\nvery distinct kind of clicking, composed of many notes in the same key,\r\nwhich follow each other rapidly. This sound the queens emit before they\r\nare permitted to leave their cells; but it does not then seem to affect\r\nthe bees. But when once they are liberated from confinement and assume\r\nthe above attitude, its effects upon them are very remarkable. As soon\r\nas the sound was heard, Huber tells us, bees that had been employed\r\nin plucking, biting, and chasing a queen about, hung down their heads\r\nand remained altogether motionless; and whenever she had recourse to\r\nthis attitude and sound, they operated upon them in the same manner.\r\nThe writer just mentioned observed differences both with regard to the\r\nsuccession and intensity of the notes and tones of this royal song;\r\nand, as he justly remarks, there may be still finer shades which,\r\nescaping our organs, may be distinctly perceived by the bees[624]. He\r\nseems however to doubt by what means this sound is produced. Reasoning\r\nanalogically, the motion of the wings should occasion it. We have\r\nseen that they are in constant motion when it is uttered. Probably\r\nthe intensity of the tones and their succession are regulated by the\r\nintensity of the vibrations of the wings. Reaumur remarks, that the\r\ndifferent tones of the bees, whether more or less grave or acute, are\r\nproduced by the strokes, more or less rapid, of their wings against\r\nthe air, and that perhaps their different angles of inclination may\r\nvary the sound. The friction of their bases likewise against the sides\r\nof the cavity in which they are inserted, as in the case of the fly\r\nlately mentioned, or against the base-covers (_Tegulæ_), may produce\r\nor modulate their sounds, a bee whose wings are eradicated being\r\nperfectly mute[625]. This last assertion, however, is contradicted by\r\nJohn Hunter, who affirms that bees produce a noise independent of their\r\nwings, emitting a shrill and peevish sound though they are cut off, and\r\nthe legs held fast[626]. Yet it does not appear from his experiment\r\nthat the wings were eradicated. And if they were only cut off, the\r\nfriction of their base might cause the sound. I have before noticed the\r\nremarkable fact, that the queens educated according to M. Schirach's\r\nmethod are absolutely mute; on which account the bees keep no guard\r\naround their cells, nor retain them an instant in them after their\r\ntransformation[627].\r\n\r\nThe _passions_, also, which urge us to various exclamations, elicit\r\nfrom insects occasionally certain sounds. Fear, anger, sorrow,\r\njoy, or love and desire, they express in particular instances by\r\nparticular noises. I shall begin with those which they emit when\r\nunder any _alarm_. One _larva_ only is recorded as uttering a cry\r\nof alarm, and it produces a perfect insect remarkable for the\r\nsame faculty: I allude to _Acherontia Atropos_. Its caterpillar,\r\nif disturbed at all, draws back rapidly, making at the same time\r\na rather loud noise, which has been compared to the crack of an\r\nelectric spark[628].--You would scarcely think that any _quiescent\r\npupæ_ could show their fears by a sound,--yet in one instance this\r\nappears to be the case. De Geer having made a small incision in the\r\ncocoon of a moth, which included that of its parasite Ichneumon (_I.\r\nCantator_, De G.), the insect concealed within the latter uttered\r\na little cry, similar to the chirping of a small grasshopper,\r\ncontinuing it for a long time together. The sound was produced by the\r\nfriction of its body against the elastic substance of its own cocoon,\r\nand was easily imitated by rubbing a knife against its surface[629].\r\n\r\nBut to come to _perfect_ insects. Many beetles when taken show their\r\nalarm by the emission of a shrill, sibilant, or creaking sound--which\r\nsome compare to the chirping of young birds--produced by rubbing\r\ntheir elytra with the extremity of their abdomen. This is the case\r\nwith the dung-chafers (_Geotrupes vernalis_, _stercorarius_, and\r\n_Copris lunaris_); with the carrion-chafer (_Trox sabulosus_); and\r\nothers of the lamellicorn beetles. The burying-beetle (_Necrophorus\r\nVespillo_), _Lema melanopa_ and _merdigera_, and _Hygrobia Hermanni_,\r\nand many other _Coleoptera_, produce a similar noise by the same\r\nmeans. When this noise is made, the movement of the abdomen may be\r\nperceived; and if a pin is introduced under the elytra it ceases.\r\nLong after many of these insects are dead the noise may be caused by\r\npressure. Rösel found this with respect to the _Scarabæidæ_[630],\r\nand I have repeated the experiment with success upon _Necrophorus\r\nVespillo_. The capricorn tribes (_Prionus_, _Lamia_, _Cerambyx_,\r\n&c.) emit under alarm an acute or creaking sound--which Lister calls\r\nquerulous, and Dumeril compares to the braying of an ass[631]--by the\r\nfriction of the thorax, which they alternately elevate and depress,\r\nagainst the neck, and sometimes against the base of the elytra[632].\r\nOn account of this, _Prionus coriarius_, is called _the fiddler_ in\r\nGermany[633]. Two other coleopterous genera, _Cychrus_ and _Clytus_,\r\nmake their cry of _Noli me tangere_ by rubbing their thorax against\r\nthe base of the elytra. _Pimelia_, another beetle, does the same by\r\nthe friction of its legs against each other[634]. And, doubtless,\r\nmany more _Coleoptera_, if observed, would be found to express their\r\nfears by similar means.\r\n\r\nIn the other orders the examples of cries of terror are much less\r\nnumerous. A bug (_Cimex subapterus_, De G.) when taken emits a\r\nsharp sound, probably with its rostrum, by moving its head up and\r\ndown[635]. Ray makes a similar remark with respect to another bug\r\n(_Reduvius personatus_), the cry of which he compares to the chirping\r\nof a grasshopper[636]. _Mutilla europæa_, a hymenopterous insect,\r\nmakes a sibilant chirping, as I once observed at Southwold, where it\r\nabounds; but how produced I cannot say. The most remarkable noise,\r\nhowever, proceeding from insects under alarm, is that emitted by the\r\ndeath's-head hawk-moth, and for which it has long been celebrated.\r\nThe _Lepidoptera_, though some of them, as we have seen, produce a\r\nsound when they fly, at other times are usually mute insects: but\r\nthis alarmist--for so it may be called, from the terrors which it\r\nhas occasioned to the superstitious[637]--when it walks, and more\r\nparticularly when it is confined, or taken into the hand, sends forth a\r\nstrong and sharp cry, resembling that of a mouse, but more plaintive,\r\nand even lamentable, which it continues as long as it is held. This cry\r\ndoes not appear to be produced by the wings; for when they, as well as\r\nthe thorax and abdomen, are held down, the cries of the insect become\r\nstill louder. Schrœter says that the animal, when it utters its cry,\r\nrubs its tongue against its head[638]; and Rösel, that it produces it\r\nby the friction of the thorax and abdomen[639]. But Reaumur found,\r\nafter the most attentive examination, that the cry came from the mouth,\r\nor rather from the tongue; and he thought that it was produced by the\r\nfriction of the palpi against that organ. When, by means of a pin,\r\nhe unfolded the spiral tongue, the cry ceased; but as soon as it was\r\nrolled up again between the palpi it was renewed. He next prevented the\r\npalpi from touching it, and the sound also ceased; and upon removing\r\nonly one of them, though it continued, it became much more feeble[640].\r\nHuber, however, denies that it is produced by the friction of the\r\ntongue and palpi[641]: but as he has not stated his reasons for this\r\nopinion, I think his assertion that he has ascertained this cannot be\r\nallowed to countervail Reaumur's experiments.\r\n\r\nI must next say a few words upon the angry chidings of our little\r\ncreatures; for their _anger_ sometimes vents itself in sounds. I have\r\noften been amused with hearing the indignant tones of a humble-bee\r\nwhile lying upon its back. When I held my finger to it, it kicked and\r\nscolded with all its might. Hive-bees when irritated emit a shrill\r\nand peevish sound, continuing even when they are held under water,\r\nwhich John Hunter says vibrates at the point of contact with the\r\nair-holes at the root of their wings[642]. This sound is particularly\r\nsharp and angry when they fly at an intruder. The same sounds, or\r\nvery similar ones, tell us when a wasp is offended, and we may expect\r\nto be stung;--but this passion of anger in insects is so nearly\r\nconnected with their fear, that I need not enlarge further upon it.\r\n\r\nConcerning their shouts of _joy_ and cries of _sorrow_ I have little\r\nto record: that pleasure or pain makes a difference in the tones of\r\nvocal insects is not improbable; but our auditory organs are not\r\nfine enough to catch all their different modulations. When Schirach\r\nhad once smoked a hive to oblige the bees to retire to the top of\r\nit, the queen with some of the rest flew away. Upon this, those that\r\nremained in the hive sent forth a most plaintive sound, as if they\r\nwere all deploring their loss; when their sovereign was restored\r\nto them, these lugubrious sounds were succeeded by an agreeable\r\nhumming, which announced their joy at the event[643]. Huber relates,\r\nthat once when all the worker-brood was removed from a hive, and only\r\nmale brood left, the bees appeared in a state of extreme despondency.\r\nAssembled in clusters upon the combs, they lost all their activity.\r\nThe queen dropped her eggs at random; and instead of the usual active\r\nhum, a dead silence reigned in the hive[644].\r\n\r\nBut _love_ is the soul of song with those that may be esteemed\r\nthe most musical insects, the grasshopper tribes (_Gryllina_ and\r\n_Locustina_), and the long celebrated Cicada. You would suppose,\r\nperhaps, that the ladies would bear their share in these amatory\r\nstrains. But here you would be mistaken--female insects are too\r\nintent upon their business, too coy and reserved to tell their love\r\neven to the winds.--The males alone\r\n\r\n          \"Formosam resonare docent Amaryllida sylvas.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the _Cicadæ_, this was observed by Aristotle; and\r\nPliny, as usual, has retailed it after him[645]. The observation also\r\nholds good with respect to the _Gryllina_, &c., and other insects,\r\nprobably, whose love is musical. Olivier however has noticed an\r\nexception to this doctrine; for he relates, that in a species of beetle\r\n(_Moluris striata_), the female has a round granulated spot in the\r\nmiddle of the second segment of the abdomen, by striking which against\r\nany hard substance, she produces a rather loud sound, and that the\r\nmale, obedient to this call, soon attends her, and they pair[646].\r\n\r\nAs I have nothing to communicate to you with respect to the love-songs\r\nof other insects, my further observations will be confined to the\r\ntribes lately mentioned, the _Gryllina_, &c. and the _Cicadæ_.\r\n\r\nNo sound is to me more agreeable than the chirping of most of the\r\n_Gryllina_, _Locustina_, &c.; it gives life to solitude, and always\r\nconveys to my mind the idea of a perfectly happy being. As these\r\ncreatures are now very properly divided into several genera, I shall\r\nsay a few words upon the song of such as are known to be vocal,\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable genus _Pneumora_--whose pellucid abdomen is blown up\r\nlike a bladder, on which account they are called _Blaazops_ by the\r\nDutch colonists at the Cape--in the evening, for they are silent\r\nin the day, make a tremulous and tolerably loud noise, which is\r\nsometimes heard on every side[647]. The species of this genus have a\r\nmuch greater claim to the name of _Fiddlers_, than the insect lately\r\nmentioned, since their sound is produced by passing the hind-legs\r\nover a number of short transverse elevated ridges on the abdomen,\r\nwhich may be called their _fiddle-strings_[648].\r\n\r\nThe _cricket_ tribe are a very noisy race, and their chirping\r\nis caused by the friction of the bases of their elytra against\r\neach other. For this purpose there is something peculiar in their\r\nstructure, which I shall describe to you. The elytra of both sexes\r\nare divided longitudinally into two portions; a vertical or lateral\r\none, which covers the sides; and a horizontal or dorsal one, which\r\ncovers the back. In the female both these portions resemble each\r\nother in their nervures; which running obliquely in two directions,\r\nby their intersection form numerous small lozenge-shaped or\r\nrhomboidal meshes or areolets. The elytra also of these have no\r\nelevation at their base. In the males the vertical portion does not\r\nmaterially differ from that of the females; but in the horizontal the\r\nbase of each elytrum is elevated so as to form a cavity underneath.\r\nThe nervures also, which are stronger and more prominent, run here\r\nand there very irregularly with various inflexions, describing\r\ncurves, spirals, and other figures difficult and tedious to\r\ndescribe, and producing a variety of areolets of different size and\r\nshape, but generally larger than those of the female: particularly\r\ntowards the extremity of the wing you may observe a space nearly\r\ncircular, surrounded by one nervure, and divided into two areolets\r\nby another[649]. The friction of the nervures of the upper or\r\nconvex surface of the base of the left-hand elytrum--which is the\r\nundermost--against those of the lower or concave surface of the base\r\nof the right-hand--which is the uppermost one--will communicate\r\nvibrations to the areas of membrane, more or less intense in\r\nproportion to the rapidity of the friction, and thus produce the\r\nsound for which these creatures are noted.\r\n\r\nThe merry inhabitant of our dwellings, the house-cricket (_Gryllus\r\ndomesticus_), though it is often heard by day, is most noisy in the\r\nnight. As soon as it grows dusk, its shrill note increases till it\r\nbecomes quite an annoyance, and interrupts conversation. When the\r\nmale sings, he elevates the elytra so as to form an acute angle with\r\nthe body, and then rubs them against each other by a horizontal and\r\nvery brisk motion[650]. The learned Scaliger is said to have been\r\nparticularly delighted with the chirping of these animals, and was\r\naccustomed to keep them in a box for his amusement. We are told\r\nthat they have been sold in Africa at a high price, and employed to\r\nprocure sleep[651]. If they could be used to supply the place of\r\nlaudanum, and lull the restlessness of busy thought in this country,\r\nthe exchange would be beneficial. Like many other noisy persons,\r\ncrickets like to hear nobody louder than themselves. Ledelius relates\r\nthat a woman, who had tried in vain every method she could think of\r\nto banish them from her house, at last got rid of them by the noise\r\nmade by drums and trumpets, which she had procured to entertain her\r\nguests at a wedding. They instantly forsook the house, and she heard\r\nof them no more[652].\r\n\r\nThe field-cricket (_Gryllus campestris_) makes a shrilling\r\nnoise--still more sonorous than that of the house-cricket--which\r\nmay be heard at a great distance. Mouffet tells us, that their\r\nsound may be imitated by rubbing their elytra, after they are taken\r\noff, against each other[653]. \"Sounds,\" says Mr. White, \"do not\r\nalways give us pleasure according to their sweetness and melody;\r\nnor do harsh sounds always displease.--Thus the shrilling of the\r\nfield-cricket, though sharp and stridulous, yet marvellously delights\r\nsome hearers, filling their minds with a train of summer ideas of\r\nevery thing that is rural, verdurous, and joyous.\" One of these\r\ncrickets when confined in a paper cage and set in the sun, and\r\nsupplied with plants moistened with water--for if they are not wetted\r\nit will die--will feed, and thrive, and become so merry and loud, as\r\nto be irksome in the same room where a person is sitting[654].\r\n\r\nHaving never seen a female of that extraordinary animal the\r\nmole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_), I cannot say what difference\r\nobtains in the reticulation of the elytra of the two sexes. The male\r\nvaries in this respect from the other male crickets, for they have no\r\ncircular area, nor do the nervures run so irregularly; the areolets,\r\nhowever, toward their base are large, with very tense membrane. The\r\nbase itself also is scarcely at all elevated. Circumstances these,\r\nwhich demonstrate the propriety of considering them distinct from the\r\nother crickets. This creature is not however mute. Where they abound\r\nthey may be heard about the middle of April singing their love-ditty\r\nin a low, dull, jarring, uninterrupted note, not unlike that of\r\nthe goat-sucker (_Caprimulgus europæus_), but more inward[655]. I\r\nremember once tracing one by its shrilling to the very hole, under a\r\nstone, in the bank of my canal, in which it was concealed.\r\n\r\nAnother tribe of grasshoppers (_Acrida_, _Pterophylla_,\r\n&c.[656])--the females of which are distinguished by their long\r\nensiform ovipositor--like the crickets, make their noise by the\r\nfriction of the base of their elytra. And the chirping they thus\r\nproduce is long, and seldom interrupted, which distinguishes it from\r\nthat of the common grasshoppers (_Locusta_). What is remarkable,\r\nthe grasshopper lark (_Sylvia locustella_), which preys upon them,\r\nmakes a similar noise. Professor Lichtenstein in the _Linnean\r\nTransactions_ has called the attention of naturalists to the eye-like\r\narea in the right wing of the males of this genus[657]; but he seems\r\nnot to have been aware that De Geer had noticed it before him as\r\na sexual character; who also, with good reason, supposes it to\r\nassist these animals in the sounds they produce. Speaking of _Acrida\r\nviridissima_--common with us--he says, \"In our male grasshoppers,\r\nin that part of the right elytrum which is folded horizontally over\r\nthe trunk, there is a round plate made of very fine transparent\r\nmembrane, resembling a little mirror or piece of talc, of the tension\r\nof a drum. This membrane is surrounded by a strong and prominent\r\nnervure, and is concealed under the fold of the left elytrum, which\r\nhas also several prominent nervures answering to the margin of the\r\nmembrane or ocellus. There is,\" he further remarks, \"every reason to\r\nbelieve that the brisk movement with which the grasshopper rubs these\r\nnervures against each other, produces a vibration in the membrane\r\naugmenting the sound. The males in question sing continually in the\r\nhedges and trees during the months of July and August, especially\r\ntowards sun-set and part of the night. When any one approaches they\r\nimmediately cease their song[658].\"\r\n\r\nThe last description of singers that I shall notice amongst the\r\n_Locustina_, and which includes the migratory locust, are those that\r\nare more commonly denominated grasshoppers. To this genus belong the\r\nlittle chirpers that we hear in every sunny bank, and which make vocal\r\nevery heath. They begin their song--which is a short chirp regularly\r\ninterrupted, in which it differs from that of the _Acridæ_--long before\r\nsun-rise. In the heat of the day it is intermitted, and resumed in the\r\nevening. This sound is thus produced:--Applying its posterior shank\r\nto the thigh, the animal rubs it briskly against the elytrum[659],\r\ndoing this alternately with the right and left legs, which causes the\r\nregular breaks in the sound. But this is not their whole apparatus of\r\nsong--since, like the Tettigoniæ, they have also a tympanum or drum.\r\nDe Geer, who examined the insects he describes with the eye of an\r\nanatomist, seems to be the only entomologist that has noticed this\r\norgan. \"On each side of the first segment of the abdomen,\" says he,\r\n\"immediately above the origin of the posterior thighs, there is a\r\nconsiderable and deep aperture of rather an oval form, which is partly\r\nclosed by an irregular flat plate or operculum of a hard substance,\r\nbut covered by a wrinkled flexible membrane. The opening left by this\r\noperculum is semi-lunar, and at the bottom of the cavity is a white\r\npellicle of considerable tension, and shining like a little mirror. On\r\nthat side of the aperture which is towards the head, there is a little\r\noval hole, into which the point of a pin may be introduced without\r\nresistance. When the pellicle is removed, a large cavity appears. In my\r\nopinion this aperture, cavity, and above all the membrane in tension,\r\ncontribute much to produce and augment the sound emitted by the\r\ngrasshopper[660].\" This description, which was taken from the migratory\r\nlocust (_L. migratoria_), answers tolerably well to the tympanum of\r\nour common grasshoppers, only in them the aperture seems to be rather\r\nsemicircular, and the wrinkled plate--which has no marginal hairs--is\r\nclearly a continuation of the substance of the segment. This apparatus\r\nso much resembles the drum of the Cicadæ, that there can be little\r\ndoubt as to its use. The vibrations caused by the friction of the\r\nthighs and elytra striking upon this drum, are reverberated by it, and\r\nso intenseness is given to the sound. In Spain, we are told that people\r\nof fashion keep these animals--called there _Grillo_--in cages, which\r\nthey name _Grilleria_, for the sake of their song[661].\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this diatribe upon the noises of insects, with a\r\ntribe that have long been celebrated for their musical powers: I mean\r\nthe _Cicadiadæ_, including the genera _Fulgora_, _Cicada_, _Tettix_,\r\nand _Tettigonia_[662]. The _Fulgoræ_ appear to be night-singers,\r\nwhile the _Cicadæ_ sing usually in the day. The great lantern-fly\r\n(_Fulgora laternaria_), from its noise in the evening--nearly\r\nresembling the sound of a cymbal, or razor-grinder when at work--is\r\ncalled _Scare-sleep_ by the Dutch in Guiana. It begins regularly at\r\nsun-set[663]. Perhaps an insect mentioned by Ligon as making a great\r\nnoise in the night in Barbadoes, may belong to this tribe. \"There is\r\na kind of animal in the woods,\" says he, \"that I never saw, which lie\r\nall day in holes and hollow trees, and as soon as the sun is down\r\nbegin their tunes, which are neither singing nor crying, but the\r\nshrillest voices I ever heard: nothing can be so nearly resembled to\r\nit as the mouths of a pack of small beagles at a distance; and so\r\nlively and chirping the noise is, as nothing can be more delightful\r\nto the ears, if there were not too much of it; for the music hath no\r\nintermission till morning, and then all is husht[664].\"\r\n\r\nThe species of the other genus, _Cicada_, called by the ancient\r\nGreeks--by whom they were often kept in cages for the sake of their\r\nsong--_Tettix_, seem to have been the favourites of every Grecian\r\nbard from Homer and Hesiod to Anacreon and Theocritus. Supposed\r\nto be perfectly harmless, and to live only upon the dew, they\r\nwere addressed by the most endearing epithets, and were regarded\r\nas all but divine. One bard entreats the shepherds to spare the\r\ninnoxious Tettix, that nightingale of the Nymphs, and to make those\r\nmischievous birds the thrush and blackbird their prey. Sweet prophet\r\nof the summer, says Anacreon, addressing this insect, the Muses\r\nlove thee, Phœbus himself loves thee, and has given thee a shrill\r\nsong; old age does not wear thee out; thou art wise, earth-born,\r\nmusical, impassive, without blood; thou art almost like a god[665].\r\nSo attached were the Athenians to these insects, that they were\r\naccustomed to fasten golden images of them in their hair, implying at\r\nthe same time a boast that they themselves, as well as the Cicadæ,\r\nwere _Terræ filii_. They were regarded indeed by all as the happiest\r\nas well as the most innocent of animals--not, we will suppose, for\r\nthe reason given by the saucy Rhodian Xenarchus, when he says,\r\n\r\n          \"Happy the Cicadas' lives,\r\n           Since they all have voiceless wives.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Grecian _Tettix_ or _Cicada_ had been distinguished by a harsh\r\nand deafening note, like those of some other countries, it would\r\nhardly have been an object of such affection. That it was not, is\r\nclearly proved by the connexion which was supposed to exist between\r\nit and music. Thus the sound of this insect and of the harp were\r\ncalled by one and the same name[666]. A Cicada sitting upon a harp\r\nwas a usual emblem of the science of music, which was thus accounted\r\nfor:--When two rival musicians, Eunomus and Ariston, were contending\r\nupon that instrument, a Cicada flying to the former and sitting upon\r\nhis harp, supplied the place of a broken string, and so secured to\r\nhim the victory[667]. To excel this animal in singing seems to have\r\nbeen the highest commendation of a singer; and even the eloquence\r\nof Plato was not thought to suffer by a comparison with it[668]. At\r\nSurinam the noise of the _Cicada Tibicen_ is still supposed so much\r\nto resemble the sound of a harp or lyre, that they are called there\r\nharpers (_Lierman_)[669]. Whether the Grecian Cicadæ maintain at\r\npresent their ancient character for music, travellers do not tell us.\r\n\r\nThose of other countries, however, have been held in less estimation\r\nfor their powers of song; or rather have been execrated for the\r\ndeafening din that they produce. Virgil accuses those of Italy of\r\nbursting the very shrubs with their noise[670]; and Sir J. E. Smith\r\nobserves that this species, which is very common, makes a most\r\ndisagreeable dull chirping[671]. Another, _Cicada septendecim_--which\r\nfortunately, as its name imports, appears only once in seventeen\r\nyears--makes such a continual din from morning to evening that\r\npeople cannot hear each other speak. They appear in Pennsylvania\r\nin incredible numbers in the middle of May[672].--\"In the hotter\r\nmonths of summer,\" says Dr. Shaw, \"especially from midday to the\r\nmiddle of the afternoon, the Cicada, τεττιξ, or grasshopper, as we\r\nfalsely translate it, is perpetually stunning our ears with its most\r\nexcessively shrill and ungrateful noise. It is in this respect\r\nthe most troublesome and impertinent of insects, perching upon a\r\ntwig and squalling sometimes two or three hours without ceasing;\r\nthereby too often disturbing the studies, or short repose that is\r\nfrequently indulged, in these hot climates, at those hours. The\r\nτεττιξ of the Greeks must have had a quite different voice, more soft\r\nsurely and melodious; otherwise the fine orators of Homer, who are\r\ncompared to it, can be looked upon no better than loud loquacious\r\nscolds[673].\"--An insect of this tribe, and I am told a very noisy\r\none, has been found by Mr. Daniel Bydder, before mentioned, in the\r\nNew Forest, Hampshire. Previously to this it was not thought that any\r\nof these insect musicians were natives of the British Isles.--Captain\r\nHancock informs me that the Brazilian Cicadæ sing so loud as to be\r\nheard at the distance of a mile. This is as if a man of ordinary\r\nstature, supposing his powers of voice increased in the ratio of his\r\nsize, could be heard all over the world. So that Stentor himself\r\nbecomes a mute when compared with these insects.\r\n\r\nYou feel very curious, doubtless, to know by what means these little\r\nanimals are enabled to emit such prodigious sounds. I have lately\r\nmentioned to you the drum of certain grasshoppers; this, however,\r\nappears to be an organ of a very simple structure; but since it is\r\nessential to the economy of the Cicadæ that their males should so\r\nmuch exceed all other insects in the loudness of their tones, they\r\nare furnished with a much more complex, and indeed most wonderful,\r\napparatus, which I shall now describe. If you look at the underside\r\nof the body of a male, the first thing that will strike you is a pair\r\nof large plates of an irregular form--in some semi-oval, in others\r\ntriangular, in others again a segment of a circle of greater or less\r\ndiameter--covering the anterior part of the belly, and fixed to the\r\ntrunk between the abdomen and the hind legs[674]. These are the\r\ndrum-covers or opercula, from beneath which the sound issues. At the\r\nbase of the posterior legs, just above each operculum, there is a small\r\npointed triangular process (_pessellum_)[675], the object of which,\r\nas Reaumur supposes, is to prevent them from being too much elevated.\r\nWhen an operculum is removed, beneath it you will find on the exterior\r\nside a hollow cavity, with a mouth somewhat linear, which seems to\r\nopen into the interior of the abdomen[676]: next to this, on the inner\r\nside, is another large cavity of an irregular shape, the bottom of\r\nwhich is divided into three portions; of these the posterior is lined\r\nobliquely with a beautiful membrane, which is very tense--in some\r\nspecies semi-opake, and in others transparent--and reflects all the\r\ncolours of the rainbow. This mirror is not the real organ of sound, but\r\nis supposed to modulate it[677]. The middle portion is occupied by a\r\nplate of a horny substance, placed horizontally and forming the bottom\r\nof the cavity. On its inner side this plate terminates in a carina or\r\nelevated ridge, common to both drums[678]. Between the plate and the\r\nafter-breast (_postpectus_) another membrane, folded transversely,\r\nfills an oblique, oblong, or semi-lunar cavity[679]. In some species I\r\nhave seen this membrane in tension--probably the insect can stretch or\r\nrelax it at its pleasure. But even all this apparatus is insufficient\r\nto produce the sound of these animals;--one still more important and\r\ncurious yet remains to be described. This organ can only be discovered\r\nby dissection. A portion of the first and second segments being removed\r\nfrom that side of the back of the abdomen which answers to the drums,\r\ntwo bundles of muscles meeting each other in an acute angle, attached\r\nto a place opposite to the point of the mucro of the first ventral\r\nsegment of the abdomen, will appear[680]. In Reaumur's specimens\r\nthese bundles of muscles seem to have been cylindrical; but in one I\r\ndissected (_Cicada capensis_) they were tubiform, the end to which\r\nthe true drum is attached being dilated[681]. These bundles consist\r\nof a prodigious number of muscular fibres applied to each other, but\r\neasily separable. Whilst Reaumur was examining one of these, pulling\r\nit from its place with a pin, he let it go again, and immediately,\r\nthough the animal had been long dead, the usual sound was emitted. On\r\neach side of the drum-cavities, when the opercula are removed, another\r\ncavity of a lunulate shape, opening into the interior of the abdomen,\r\nis observable[682]. In this is the true drum, the principal organ of\r\nsound, and its aperture is to the Cicada what our larynx is to us. If\r\nthese creatures are unable themselves to modulate their sounds, here\r\nare parts enough to do it for them: for the mirrors, the membranes,\r\nand the central portions, with their cavities, all assist in it. In\r\nthe cavity last described, if you remove the lateral part of the first\r\ndorsal segment of the abdomen, you will discover a semi-opaque and\r\nnearly semicircular concavo-convex membrane with transverse folds--this\r\nis the drum[683]. Each bundle of muscles, before mentioned, is\r\nterminated by a tendinous plate nearly circular, from which issue\r\nseveral little tendons that, forming a thread, pass through an aperture\r\nin the horny piece that supports the drum, and are attached to its\r\nunder or concave surface. Thus the bundle of muscles being alternately\r\nand briskly relaxed and contracted, will by its play draw in and let\r\nout the drum: so that its convex surface being thus rendered concave\r\nwhen pulled in, when let out a sound will be produced by the effort\r\nto recover its convexity; which, striking upon the mirror and other\r\nmembranes before it escapes from under the operculum, will be modulated\r\nand augmented by them[684]. I should imagine that the muscular bundles\r\nare extended and contracted by the alternate approach and recession of\r\nthe trunk and abdomen to and from each other.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my friend, what adorable wisdom, what consummate art\r\nand skill are displayed in the admirable contrivance and complex\r\nstructure of this wonderful, this unparalleled apparatus! The GREAT\r\nCREATOR has placed in these insects an organ for producing and\r\nemitting sounds, which in the intricacy of its construction seems to\r\nresemble that which he has given to man, and the larger animals, for\r\nreceiving them. Here is a _cochlea_; a _meatus_; and, as it should\r\nseem, more than one _tympanum_.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[600] See above, p. 98.\r\n\r\n[601] _Syst.

The mirror is the part directly beneath these bundles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                         _ON LUMINOUS INSECTS._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe boast of our candles, our wax-lights, and our Argand lamps,\r\nand pity our fellow-men who, ignorant of our methods of producing\r\nartificial light, are condemned to pass their nights in darkness. We\r\nregard these inventions as the results of a great exertion of human\r\nintellect, and never conceive it possible that other animals are able\r\nto avail themselves of modes of illumination equally efficient; and\r\nare furnished with the means of guiding their nocturnal evolutions\r\nby actual lights, similar in their effect to those which we make\r\nuse of. Yet many insects are thus provided. Some are forced to\r\ncontent themselves with a single candle, not more vivid than the\r\nrush-light which glimmers in the peasant's cottage; others exhibit\r\ntwo or four, which cast a stronger radiance; and a few can display a\r\nlamp little inferior in brilliancy to some of ours. Not that these\r\ninsects are actually possessed of candles and lamps. You are aware\r\nthat I am speaking figuratively. But Providence has supplied them\r\nwith an effectual substitute--a luminous preparation or secretion,\r\nwhich has all the advantages of our lamps and candles without their\r\ninconveniences; which gives light sufficient to direct their\r\nmotions, while it is incapable of burning; and whose lustre is\r\nmaintained without needing fresh supplies of oil or the application\r\nof the snuffers.\r\n\r\nOf the insects thus singularly provided, the common glow-worm\r\n(_Lampyris noctiluca_) is the most familiar instance. Who that has\r\never enjoyed the luxury of a summer evening's walk in the country,\r\nin the southern parts of our island, but has viewed with admiration\r\nthese \"stars of the earth and diamonds of the night?\" And if, living\r\nlike me in a district where it is rarely met with, the first time\r\nyou saw this insect, chanced to be, as it was in my case, one of\r\nthose delightful evenings which an English summer seldom yields, when\r\nnot a breeze disturbs the balmy air, and \"every sense is joy,\" and\r\nhundreds of these radiant worms, studding their mossy couch with mild\r\neffulgence, were presented to your wondering eye in the course of a\r\nquarter of a mile,--you could not help associating with the name of\r\nglow-worm the most pleasing recollections. No wonder that an insect,\r\nwhich chiefly exhibits itself on occasions so interesting, and whose\r\neconomy is so remarkable, should have afforded exquisite images and\r\nillustrations to those poets who have cultivated Natural History.\r\n\r\nIf you take one of these glow-worms home with you for examination,\r\nyou will find that in shape it somewhat resembles a caterpillar, only\r\nthat it is much more depressed; and you will observe that the light\r\nproceeds from a pale-coloured patch that terminates the underside\r\nof the abdomen. It is not, however, the larva of an insect, but the\r\nperfect female of a winged beetle, from which it is altogether so\r\ndifferent, that nothing but actual observation could have inferred\r\nthe fact of their being the sexes of the same insect. In the course\r\nof our inquiries you will find that sexual differences even more\r\nextraordinary exist in the insect world.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by many that the males of the different species\r\nof _Lampyris_ do not possess the property of giving out any light;\r\nbut it is now ascertained that this supposition is inaccurate,\r\nthough their light is much less vivid than that of the female. Ray\r\nfirst pointed out this fact with respect to _L. noctiluca_[685].\r\nGeoffroy also observed that the male of this species has four\r\nsmall luminous points, two on each of the two last segments of the\r\nbelly[686]: and his observation has been recently confirmed by\r\nMüller. This last entomologist, indeed, saw only two shining spots;\r\nbut from the insect's having the power of withdrawing them out of\r\nsight so that not the smallest trace of light remains, he thinks\r\nit is not improbable that at times two other points still smaller\r\nmay be exhibited, as Geoffroy has described. In the males of _L.\r\nSplendidula_ and of _L. hemiptera_ the light is very distinct, and\r\nmay be seen in the former while flying[687].--The females have the\r\nsame faculty of extinguishing or concealing their light--a very\r\nnecessary provision to guard them from the attacks of nocturnal\r\nbirds: Mr. White even thinks that they regularly put it out between\r\neleven and twelve every night[688]: and they have also the power of\r\nrendering it for a while more vivid than ordinary.\r\n\r\nAuthors who have noticed the luminous parts of the common female\r\nglow-worm, having usually contented themselves with stating that the\r\nlight issues from the three last ventral segments of the abdomen[689];\r\nI shall give you the result of some observations I once made upon\r\nthis subject. One evening, in the beginning of July, meeting with two\r\nof these insects, I placed them on my hand. At first their light was\r\nexceedingly brilliant, so as to appear even at the junctions of the\r\nupper or dorsal segments of the abdomen. Soon after I had taken them,\r\none withdrew its light altogether, but the other continued to shine.\r\nWhile it did this it was laid upon its back, the abdomen forming an\r\nangle with the rest of its body, and the last or anal segment being\r\nkept in constant motion. This segment was distinguished by two round\r\nand very vivid spots of light; which, in the specimen that had ceased\r\nto shine, were the last that disappeared, and they seem to be the first\r\nparts that become luminous when the animal is disposed to yield its\r\nlight. The penultimate and antepenultimate segments each exhibited a\r\nmiddle transverse band of yellow radiance, terminated towards the trunk\r\nby an obtusely-dentated line; a greener and fainter light being emitted\r\nby the rest of the segment.\r\n\r\nThough many of the females of the _Lampyridæ_ are without wings\r\nand even elytra, (in which circumstance they differ from all other\r\napterous _Coleoptera_,) this is not the case with all. The female of\r\n_Pygolampis_[690] _italica_, a species common in Italy, and which,\r\nif we may trust to the accuracy of the account given by Mr. Waller\r\nin the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1684, would seem to have\r\nbeen taken by him in Hertfordshire, is winged: and when a number of\r\nthese moving stars are seen to dart through the air in a dark night,\r\nnothing can have a more beautiful effect. Sir J. E. Smith tells us\r\nthat the beaus of Italy are accustomed in an evening to adorn the\r\nheads of the ladies with these artificial diamonds, by sticking them\r\ninto their hair; and a similar custom, as I have before informed\r\nyou[691], prevails amongst the ladies of India.\r\n\r\nBesides the different species of the genus _Lampyris_, all of which\r\nare probably more or less luminous, another insect of the beetle\r\ntribe, _Elater noctilucus_, is endowed with the same property,\r\nand that in a much higher degree. This insect, which is called\r\nthe fire-fly, and is an inch long, and about one-third of an inch\r\nbroad, gives out its principal light from two transparent eye-like\r\ntubercles placed upon the thorax; but there are also two luminous\r\npatches concealed under the elytra, which are not visible except when\r\nthe insect is flying, at which time it appears adorned with four\r\nbrilliant gems of the most beautiful golden-blue lustre: in fact, the\r\nwhole body is full of light, which shines out between the abdominal\r\nsegments when stretched. The light emitted by the two thoracic\r\ntubercles alone is so considerable, that the smallest print may be\r\nread by moving one of these insects along the lines; and in the West\r\nIndia islands, particularly in St. Domingo, where they are very\r\ncommon, the natives were formerly accustomed to employ these living\r\nlamps, which they called _Cucuij_, instead of candles in performing\r\ntheir evening household occupations. In travelling at night they used\r\nto tie one to each great toe; and in fishing and hunting required\r\nno other flambeau[692].--Southey has happily introduced this insect\r\nin his \"_Madoc_\" as furnishing the lamp by which Coatel rescued the\r\nBritish hero from the hands of the Mexican priests.\r\n\r\n          \"She beckon'd and descended, and drew out\r\n           From underneath her vest a cage, or net\r\n           It rather might be call'd, so fine the twigs\r\n           Which knit it, where, confined, two Fire-flies gave\r\n           Their lustre. By that light did Madoc first\r\n           Behold the features of his lovely guide.\"\r\n\r\nPietro Martire tells us that the Cucuij serve the natives of the\r\nSpanish West India islands not only instead of candles, but as\r\nextirpators of the gnats, which are a dreadful pest to the inhabitants\r\nof the low grounds. They introduce a few fire-flies, to which the\r\ngnats are a grateful food, into their houses, and by means of these\r\n\"commodious hunters\" are soon rid of the intruders. \"How they are a\r\nremedy,\" says this author, \"for so great a mischiefe it is a pleasant\r\nthing to hear. Hee who understandeth he hath those troublesome guestes\r\n(the gnattes) at home, diligently hunteth after the Cucuij. Whoso\r\nwanteth Cucuij goeth out of the house in the first twilight of the\r\nnight, carrying a burning fire-brande in his hande, and ascendeth\r\nthe next hillock that the Cucuij may see it, and hee swingeth the\r\nfire-brande about, calling Cucuius aloud, and beating the ayre with\r\noften calling out _Cucuie, Cucuie_.\" He goes on to observe, that the\r\nsimple people believe the insect is attracted by their invitations;\r\nbut that, for his part he is rather inclined to think that the fire\r\nis the magnet. Having obtained a sufficient number of Cucuij, the\r\nbeetle-hunter returns home and lets them fly loose in the house, where\r\nthey diligently seek the gnats about the beds and the faces of those\r\nasleep, and devour them[693].--These insects are also applied to\r\npurposes of decoration. On certain festival days in the month of June,\r\nthey are collected in great numbers, and tied all over the garments of\r\nthe young people, who gallop through the streets on horses similarly\r\nornamented, producing on a dark evening the effect of a large moving\r\nbody of light. On such occasions the lover displays his gallantry by\r\ndecking his mistress with these living gems[694]. And according to P.\r\nMartire, \"many wanton wilde fellowes\" rub their faces with the flesh of\r\na killed Cucuius, as boys with us use phosphorus, \"with purpose to meet\r\ntheir neighbours with a flaming countenance,\" and derive amusement from\r\ntheir fright.\r\n\r\nBesides _Elater noctilucus_, _E. ignitus_ and several others of\r\nthe same genus are luminous. Not fewer than twelve species of this\r\nfamily are described by Illiger in the _Berlin Naturalist Society's\r\nMagazine_[695].\r\n\r\nThe brilliant nocturnal spectacle presented by these insects to the\r\ninhabitants of the countries where they abound cannot be better\r\ndescribed than in the language of the poet above referred to, who has\r\nthus related its first effect upon the British visitors of the new\r\nworld:\r\n\r\n                  \"..............Sorrowing we beheld\r\n          The night come on; but soon did night display\r\n          More wonders than it veil'd: innumerous tribes\r\n          From the wood-cover swarm'd, and darkness made\r\n          Their beauties visible: one while they stream'd\r\n          A bright blue radiance upon flowers that closed\r\n          Their gorgeous colours from the eye of day;\r\n          Now motionless and dark, eluded search,\r\n          Self-shrouded; and anon, starring the sky,\r\n          Rose like a shower of fire.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful poetical imagery with which Mr. Southey has decorated\r\nthis and a few other entomological facts, will make you join in my\r\nregret that a more extensive acquaintance with the science has not\r\nenabled him to spread his embellishments over a greater number.\r\nThe gratification which the entomologist derives from seeing his\r\nfavourite study adorned with the graces of poetry is seldom unalloyed\r\nwith pain, arising from the inaccurate knowledge of the subject\r\nin the poet. Dr. Darwin's description of the beetle to which the\r\nnut-maggot is transformed may delight him (at least if he be an\r\nadmirer of the Darwinian style) as he reads for the first time,\r\n\r\n          \"So sleeps in silence the Curculio, shut\r\n           In the dark chamber of the cavern'd nut;\r\n           Erodes with ivory beak the vaulted shell,\r\n           And quits on filmy wings its narrow cell.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the music of the lines has allowed him room for pause,\r\nand he recollects that they are built wholly upon an incorrect\r\nsupposition, the Curculio never inhabiting the nut in its beetle\r\nshape, nor employing its ivory or rather ebony beak upon it, but\r\nundergoing its transformation under ground, he feels disappointed\r\nthat the passage has not truth as well as sound.--Mr. Southey, too,\r\nhas fallen into an error: he confounds the fire-fly of St. Domingo\r\n(_Elater noctilucus_) with a quite different insect, the lantern-fly\r\n(_Fulgora laternaria_) of Madame Merian; but happily this error does\r\nnot affect his poetry.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression.--If we are to believe Mouffet,\r\n(and the story is not incredible,) the appearance of the tropical\r\nfire-flies on one occasion led to a more important result than might\r\nhave been expected from such a cause. He tells us, that when Sir\r\nThomas Cavendish and Sir Robert Dudley first landed in the West\r\nIndies, and saw in the evening an infinite number of moving lights in\r\nthe woods, which were merely these insects, they supposed that the\r\nSpaniards were advancing upon them, and immediately betook themselves\r\nto their ships[696]:--a result as well entitling the Elaters to\r\na commemoration feast, as a similar good office the land-crabs\r\nof Hispaniola, which, as the Spaniards tell, (and the story is\r\nconfirmed by an anniversary _Fiesta de lôs Cangrejos_,) by their\r\nclattering--mistaken by the enemy for the sound of Spanish cavalry\r\nclose upon their heels--in like manner scared away a body of English\r\ninvaders of the city of St. Domingo[697].\r\n\r\nAn anecdote less improbable, perhaps, and certainly more ludicrous,\r\nis related by Sir J. E. Smith of the effect of the first sight of\r\nthe Italian glow-worms upon some Moorish ladies ignorant of such\r\nappearances. These females had been taken prisoners at sea, and,\r\nuntil they could be ransomed, lived in a house in the outskirts\r\nof Genoa, where they were frequently visited by the respectable\r\ninhabitants of the city; a party of whom, on going one evening,\r\nwere surprised to find the house closely shut up, and their Moorish\r\nfriends in the greatest grief and consternation. On inquiring into\r\nthe cause, they ascertained that some of the _Pygolampis italica_\r\nhad found their way into the dwelling, and that the ladies within\r\nhad taken it into their heads that these brilliant guests were no\r\nother than the troubled spirits of their relations; of which idea it\r\nwas some time before they could be divested.--The common people in\r\nItaly have a superstition respecting these insects somewhat similar,\r\nbelieving that they are of a spiritual nature, and proceed out of the\r\ngraves, and hence carefully avoid them[698].\r\n\r\nThe insects hitherto adverted to have been beetles, or of the order\r\n_Coleoptera_. But besides these, a genus in the order _Hemiptera_,\r\ncalled _Fulgora_, includes several species which emit so powerful\r\na light as to have obtained in English the generic appellation of\r\n_Lantern-flies_. Two of the most conspicuous of this tribe are the\r\n_F. laternaria_ and _F. candelaria_; the former a native of South\r\nAmerica, the latter of China. Both, as indeed is the case with the\r\nwhole genus, have the material which diffuses their light included in\r\na hollow subtransparent projection of the head. In _F. candelaria_\r\nthis projection is of a subcylindrical shape, recurved at the apex,\r\nabove an inch in length, and the thickness of a small quill. We may\r\neasily conceive, as travellers assure us, that a tree studded with\r\nmultitudes of these living sparks, some at rest and others in motion,\r\nmust at night have a superlatively splendid appearance.--In _F.\r\nlaternaria_, which is an insect two or three inches long, the snout\r\nis much larger and broader, and more of an oval shape, and sheds a\r\nlight the brilliancy of which transcends that of any other luminous\r\ninsect. Madame Merian informs us, that the first discovery which\r\nshe made of this property caused her no small alarm. The Indians had\r\nbrought her several of these insects, which by day-light exhibited no\r\nextraordinary appearance, and she inclosed them in a box until she\r\nshould have an opportunity of drawing them, placing it upon a table\r\nin her lodging-room. In the middle of the night the confined insects\r\nmade such a noise as to awake her, and she opened the box, the inside\r\nof which to her great astonishment appeared all in a blaze; and in\r\nher fright letting it fall, she was not less surprised to see each\r\nof the insects apparently on fire. She soon, however, divined the\r\ncause of this unexpected phenomenon, and re-inclosed her brilliant\r\nguests in their place of confinement. She adds, that the light of\r\none of these _Fulgoræ_ is sufficiently bright to read a newspaper\r\nby: and though the tale of her having drawn one of these insects by\r\nits own light is without foundation, she doubtless might have done\r\nso if she had chosen[699].--Another species (_F. pyrrhorynchus_) is\r\nfigured by Mr. Donovan in his _Insects of India_, of which the light,\r\nthough from a smaller snout than that of _F. laternaria_, must assume\r\na more splendid and striking appearance, the projection being of a\r\nrich deep purple from the base to near the apex, which is of a fine\r\ntransparent scarlet; and these tints will of course be imparted to\r\nthe transmitted light.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the insects already mentioned, some others have the\r\npower of diffusing light, as two species of _Centipedes_ (_Geophilus\r\nelectricus_ and _phosphoreus_), and probably others of the same genus.\r\nIn these the light is not confined to one part, but proceeds from\r\nthe whole body. _G. electricus_ is a common insect in this country,\r\nresiding under clods of earth, and often visible at night in gardens.\r\n_G_? _phosphoreus_, a native of Asia, is an obscure species, described\r\nby Linné, on the authority of C. G. Ekeberg, the captain of a Swedish\r\nEast Indiaman, who asserted that it dropped from the air, shining like\r\na glow-worm, upon his ship, when sailing in the Indian ocean a hundred\r\nmiles (Swedish) from the continent. However singular this statement,\r\nit is not incredible. The insect may either, as Linné suspects, have\r\nbeen elevated into the atmosphere by wings with which, according to\r\nhim, one species of the genus is provided; or more probably, perhaps,\r\nby a strong wind, such as that which raised into the air the shower of\r\ninsects mentioned by De Geer as occurring in Sweden in the winter of\r\n1749, after a violent storm that had torn up trees by the roots, and\r\ncarried away to a great distance the surrounding earth, and insects\r\nwhich had taken up their winter quarters amongst it[700]. That the\r\nwind may convey the light body of an insect to the above-mentioned\r\ndistance from land, you will not dispute when you call to mind that our\r\nfriend Hooker, in his interesting _Tour in Iceland_, tells us that the\r\nashes from the eruption of one of the Icelandic volcanos in 1755 were\r\nconveyed to Ferrol, a distance of upwards of 300 miles[701].--Lastly,\r\nto conclude my list of luminous insects, Professor Afzelius observed \"a\r\ndim phosphoric light\" to be emitted from the singular hollow antennæ\r\nof _Pausus sphærocerus_[702]. A similar appearance has been noticed\r\nin the eyes of _Acronycta Psi_, _Cossus ligniperda_, and other moths.\r\n_Chiroscelis bifenestrata_ of Lamarck, a beetle, has two red oval spots\r\ncovered with a downy membrane on the second segment of the abdomen,\r\nwhich he thinks indicate some particular organ perhaps luminous[703]:\r\nand M. Latreille informs me that a friend of his, who saw one living\r\nwhich was brought from China to the Isle of France in wood, found that\r\nthe _ocelli_ in the elytra of _Buprestis ocellata_ were luminous.\r\n\r\nBut besides the insects here enumerated, others may be luminous which\r\nhave not hitherto been suspected of being so. This seems proved by the\r\nfollowing fact. A learned friend[704] has informed me, that when he was\r\ncurate of Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, in 1780, a farmer of that place of\r\nthe name of Simpringham brought to him a mole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa\r\nvulgaris_, Latr.), and told him that one of his people, seeing a\r\n_Jack-o'lantern_, pursued it and knocked it down, when it proved to be\r\nthis insect, and the identical specimen shown to him.\r\n\r\nThis singular fact, while it renders it probable that some insects\r\nare luminous which no one has imagined to be so, seems to afford\r\na clue to the, at least, partial explanation of the very obscure\r\nsubject of _ignes fatui_, and to show that there is considerable\r\nground for the opinion long ago maintained by Ray and Willughby,\r\nthat the majority of these supposed meteors are no other than\r\nluminous insects. That the large varying lambent flames, mentioned by\r\nBeccaria to be very common in some parts of Italy, and the luminous\r\nglobe seen by Dr. Shaw[705] cannot be thus explained, is obvious.\r\nThese were probably electrical phenomena: certainly not explosions\r\nof phosphuretted hydrogene, as has been suggested by some, which\r\nmust necessarily have been momentary. But that the _ignis fatuus_\r\nmentioned by Derham as having been seen by himself, and which he\r\ndescribes as flitting about a thistle[706], was, though he seems of a\r\ndifferent opinion, no other than some luminous insect, I have little\r\ndoubt. Mr. Sheppard informs me that, travelling one night between\r\nStamford and Grantham on the top of the stage, he observed for more\r\nthan ten minutes a very large _ignis fatuus_ in the low marshy\r\ngrounds, which had every appearance of being an insect. The wind was\r\nvery high: consequently, had it been a vapour, it must have been\r\ncarried forward in a direct line; but this was not the case. It had\r\nthe same motions as a Tipula, flying upwards and downwards, backwards\r\nand forwards, sometimes appearing as settled, and sometimes as\r\nhovering in the air.--Whatever be the true nature of these meteors,\r\nof which so much is said and so little known, it is singular how few\r\nmodern instances of their having been observed are on record. Dr.\r\nDarwin declares, that though in the course of a long life he had been\r\nout in the night, and in the places where they are said to appear,\r\ntimes without number, he had never seen any thing of the kind: and\r\nfrom the silence of other philosophers of our own times, it should\r\nseem that their experience is similar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith regard to the immediate source of the luminous properties of\r\nthese insects, Mr. Macartney, to whom we are indebted for the most\r\nrecent investigation on the subject, has ascertained that in the\r\ncommon glow-worm, and in _Elater noctilucus_ and _ignitus_, the light\r\nproceeds from masses of a substance not generally differing, except in\r\nits yellow colour, from the interstitial substance (_corps graisseux_)\r\nof the rest of the body, closely applied underneath those transparent\r\nparts of the insects' skin which afford the light. In the glow-worm,\r\nbesides the last-mentioned substance, which, when the season for giving\r\nlight is passed, is absorbed, and replaced by the common interstitial\r\nsubstance, he observed on the inner side of the last abdominal segment\r\ntwo minute oval sacs formed of an elastic spirally-wound fibre similar\r\nto that of the tracheæ, containing a soft yellow substance of a closer\r\ntexture than that which lines the adjoining region, and affording a\r\nmore permanent and brilliant light. This light he found to be less\r\nunder the control of the insect than that from the adjoining luminous\r\nsubstance, which it has the power of voluntarily extinguishing, not\r\nby retracting it under a membrane, as Carradori imagined, but by\r\nsome inscrutable change dependent upon its will: and when the latter\r\nsubstance was extracted from living glow-worms it afforded no light,\r\nwhile the two sacs in like circumstances shone uninterruptedly for\r\nseveral hours. Mr. Macartney conceives, from the radiated structure\r\nof the interstitial substance surrounding the oval yellow masses\r\nimmediately under the transparent spots in the thorax of _Elater\r\nnoctilucus_, and the subtransparency of the adjoining crust, that the\r\ninterstitial substance in this situation has also the property of\r\nshining--a supposition which, if De Geer and other authors be correct\r\nin stating that this insect has two luminous patches under its elytra,\r\nand that the incisures between the abdominal segments shine when\r\nstretched, may probably be extended to the _whole_ of the interstitial\r\nsubstance of its body.--What peculiar organization contributes to the\r\nproduction of light in the hollow projections of _Fulgora laternaria_\r\nand _candelaria_, the hollow antennæ of _Pausus sphærocerus_, and\r\nunder the whole integument of _Geophilus electricus_, Mr. Macartney\r\nwas unable to ascertain. Respecting this last he remarks, what I have\r\nmyself observed, that there is an apparent effusion of a luminous fluid\r\non its surface, that may be received upon the hand, which exhibits a\r\nphosphoric light for a few seconds afterwards; and that it will not\r\nshine unless it have been previously exposed for a short time to the\r\nsolar light[707].\r\n\r\nWith respect to the remote cause of the luminous property of insects,\r\nphilosophers are considerably divided in opinion. The disciples\r\nof modern Chemistry have in general, with Dr. Darwin, referred it\r\nto the slow combustion of some combination of phosphorus secreted\r\nfrom their fluids by an appropriate organization, and entering into\r\ncombination with the oxygene supplied in respiration. This opinion\r\nis very plausibly built upon the ascertained existence of phosphoric\r\nacid as an animal secretion; the great resemblance between the light\r\nof phosphorus in slow combustion and animal light; the remarkably\r\nlarge spiracula in glow-worms; and upon the statement, that the light\r\nof the glow-worm is rendered more brilliant by the application of\r\nheat and oxygene gas, and is extinguished by cold and by hydrogene\r\nand carbonic acid gases. From these last facts Spallanzani was led to\r\nregard the luminous matter as a compound of hydrogene and carburetted\r\nhydrogene gas. Carradori having found that the luminous portion of\r\nthe belly of the Italian glow-worm (_Pygolampis italica_) shone in\r\nvacuo, in oil, in water, and when under other circumstances where\r\nthe presence of oxygene gas was precluded, with Brugnatelli ascribed\r\nthe property in question to the imbibition of light separated from\r\nthe food or air taken into the body, and afterwards secreted in\r\na sensible form[708]. Lastly, Mr. Macartney having ascertained\r\nby experiment that the light of a glow-worm is not diminished by\r\nimmersion in water, or increased by the application of heat; that the\r\nsubstance affording it, though poetically employed for lighting the\r\nfairies' tapers[709], is incapable of inflammation if applied to\r\nthe flame of a candle or red-hot iron; and when separated from the\r\nbody exhibits no sensible heat on the thermometer's being applied to\r\nit--rejects the preceding hypotheses as unsatisfactory, but without\r\nsubstituting any other explanation; suggesting, however, that the\r\nfacts he observed are more favourable to the supposition of light\r\nbeing a quality of matter than a substance[710].\r\n\r\nWhich of these opinions is the more correct I do not pretend to\r\ndecide. But though the experiments of Mr. Macartney seem fairly to\r\nbear him out in denying the existence of any ordinary combination of\r\nphosphorus in luminous insects, there exists a contradiction in many\r\nof the statements, which requires reconciling before final decision\r\ncan be pronounced. The different results obtained by Forster and\r\nSpallanzani, who assert that glow-worms shine more brilliantly in\r\noxygene gas, and by Beckerheim, Dr. Hulme, and Sir H. Davy, who\r\ncould perceive no such effect, may perhaps be accounted for by the\r\nsupposition that in the latter instances the insects having been\r\ntaken more recently, might be less sensible to the stimulus of the\r\ngas than in the former, where possibly their irritability was, as\r\nBrown would say, accumulated by a longer abstinence: but it is not\r\nso easy to reconcile the experiment of Sir H. Davy, who found the\r\nlight of the glow-worm not to be sensibly diminished in hydrogene\r\ngas[711], with those of Spallanzani and Dr. Hulme, who found it\r\nto be extinguished by the same gas, as well as by carbonic acid,\r\nnitrous and sulphuretted hydrogene gases[712]. Possibly some of\r\nthese contradictory results were occasioned by not adverting to the\r\nfaculty which the living insect possesses of extinguishing its lights\r\nat pleasure; or different philosophers may have experimented on\r\ndifferent species of Lampyris.\r\n\r\nThe general use of this singular provision is not much more\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained than its nature. I have before\r\nconjectured--and in an instance I then related it seemed to be so--that\r\nit may be a means of defence against their enemies[713]. In different\r\nkinds of insects, however, it may probably have a different object.\r\nThus in the lantern-flies (_Fulgora_), whose light precedes them, it\r\nmay act the part that their name imports, enabling them to discover\r\ntheir prey, and to steer themselves safely in the night. In the\r\nfire-flies (_Elater_), if we consider the infinite numbers that in\r\ncertain climates and situations present themselves every where in the\r\nnight, it may distract the attention of their enemies or alarm them.\r\nAnd in the glow-worm--since their light is usually most brilliant in\r\nthe female; in some species, if not all, present only in the season\r\nwhen the sexes are destined to meet; and strikingly more vivid at the\r\nvery moment when the meeting takes place[714]--besides the above uses,\r\nit is most probably intended to conduct the sexes to each other. This\r\nseems evidently the design in view in those species in which, as in the\r\ncommon glow-worm (_L. noctiluca_), the females are apterous. The torch\r\nwhich the wingless female, doomed to crawl upon the grass, lights up at\r\nthe approach of night, is a beacon which unerringly guides the vagrant\r\nmale to her \"love-illumined form,\" however obscure the place of her\r\nabode. It has been objected, however, to this explanation, that--since\r\nboth larva and pupa, as De Geer observed[715], and the males shine\r\nas well as the females--the meeting of the sexes can scarcely be the\r\nobject of their luminous provision. But this difficulty appears to me\r\neasily surmounted. As the light proceeds from a peculiarly organized\r\nsubstance, which probably must in part be elaborated in the larva and\r\npupa states, there seems nothing inconsistent in the fact of _some_\r\nlight being then emitted with the supposition of its being destined\r\nsolely for use in the perfect state: and the circumstance of the male\r\nhaving the same luminous property, no more proves that the superior\r\nbrilliancy of the female is not intended for conducting him to her,\r\nthan the existence of nipples and sometimes of milk in man proves that\r\nthe breast of woman is not meant for the support of her offspring. We\r\noften see without being able to account for the fact, except on Sir E.\r\nHome's idea, that the sex of the ovum is undetermined[716], traces of\r\nan organization in one sex indisputably intended for the sole use of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[685] _Hist.

The graminivorous quadrupeds, with few exceptions, however\r\nscanty their bill of fare, and their carnivorous brethren, as well as\r\nthe whole race of birds and fishes, can at all seasons satisfy, in\r\ngreater or less abundance, their demand for food. But to the great\r\nmajority of insects, the earth for nearly one half of the year is a\r\nbarren desert, affording no appropriate nutriment. As soon as winter\r\nhas stripped the vegetable world of its foliage, the vast hosts of\r\ninsects that feed on the leaves of plants must necessarily fast until\r\nthe return of spring: and even the carnivorous tribes, such as the\r\npredaceous beetles, parasitic _Hymenoptera_, _Sphecina_, &c. would at\r\nthat period of the year in vain look for their accustomed prey.\r\n\r\nHow is this difficulty provided for? In what mode has the Universal\r\nParent secured an uninterrupted succession of generations in a class\r\nof animals for the most part doomed to a six months' deprivation\r\nof the food which they ordinarily devour with such voracity? By a\r\nbeautiful series of provisions founded on the faculty, common also\r\nto some of the larger animals, of passing the winter in a state of\r\ntorpor--by ordaining that the insect shall live through that period,\r\neither in an incomplete state of its existence when its organs of\r\nnutrition are undeveloped, or, if the active epoch of its life has\r\ncommenced, that it shall seek out appropriate _hybernacula_, or\r\nwinter quarters, and in them fall into a profound sleep, during which\r\na supply of food is equally unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn two of the four states of existence common to insects, in which\r\ndifferent tribes pass the winter, namely, the egg and the pupa state,\r\nthe organs for taking food (except in some cases in the latter) are\r\nnot developed, and consequently the animal is incapable of eating. The\r\nexistence of insects in these states during the winter, differs from\r\ntheir existence in the same form in summer only in the greater length\r\nof its term. In both seasons food is alike unnecessary, so that their\r\nhybernation in these circumstances has little or nothing analogous to\r\nthat of larger animals. With this, however, strictly accords their\r\nhybernation in the larva and imago states, in which their abstinence\r\nfrom food is solely owing to the torpor that pervades them, and the\r\nconsequent non-expenditure of the vital powers.--I shall attend to\r\nthe peculiarities of their hybernation in each of these states in the\r\norder just laid down; premising that we have yet much to learn on this\r\nsubject, no observations having been instituted respecting the state in\r\nwhich multitudes of insects pass the winter.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some insects of almost every order hybernate\r\nin the _egg_ state: though that these must be comparatively few\r\nin number, seems proved from two considerations: first, That the\r\nmajority of insects assume the imago, and deposit their eggs in\r\nthe summer and early part of autumn, when the heat suffices to\r\nhatch them in a short period: and secondly, That the eggs of a very\r\nlarge proportion of insects require for their due exclusion and the\r\nnutriment of the larvæ springing from them, conditions only to be\r\nfulfilled in summer, as all those which are laid in young fruits and\r\nseeds; in the interior and galls of leaves; in insects that exist\r\nonly in summer, &c. &c. The insects which pass the winter in the\r\negg state are chiefly such as have several broods in the course of\r\nthe year, the females of the last of which lay eggs that, requiring\r\nmore heat for their development than then exists, necessarily remain\r\ndormant until the return of spring.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which the female insect places her eggs in order\r\nto their remaining there through the winter, is always admirably\r\nadapted to the degree of cold which they are capable of sustaining;\r\nand to the ensuring a due supply of food for the nascent larvæ. Thus,\r\nwith the former view, _Acrida verrucivora_ and many other insects\r\nwhose eggs are of a tender consistence, deposit them deep in the\r\nearth out of the reach of frost; and with the latter, _Trichoda\r\nNeustria_, _Lasiocampa castrensis_, _Hypogymna dispar_, and some\r\nother moths, departing from the ordinary instinct of their congeners,\r\nwhich teaches them to place their eggs upon the _leaves_ of plants,\r\nfix theirs to the stem and branches only. That this variation of\r\nprocedure has reference to the hybernation of the eggs of these\r\nparticular species, is abundantly obvious. Insects whose eggs are to\r\nbe hatched in summer, usually fix them slightly to the leaves upon\r\nwhich the larvæ are to feed. But it is evident that, were this plan\r\nto be adopted by those whose eggs remain through the winter, their\r\nprogeny might be blown away along with the leaf to which they are\r\nattached, far from their destined food. These, therefore, choose a\r\nmore stable support, and carefully fasten them, as has just been\r\nobserved, either to the trunk or branches of the tree, whose young\r\nleaves in spring are to be the food of the excluded larvæ. The\r\nlatter plan is followed by the female of _Trichoda Neustria_, which\r\ncuriously gums her eggs in bracelets round the twigs of the hawthorn,\r\n&c. But another provision is demanded. Were these eggs of the usual\r\ndelicate consistence, and to be attached with the ordinary slight\r\ngluten, they would have a poor chance of surviving the storms of rain\r\nand snow and hail to which for six or eight months they are exposed.\r\nThey are therefore covered with a shell much more hard and thick\r\nthan common; packed as closely as possible to each other; and the\r\ninterstices are filled up with a tenacious gum, which soon hardens\r\nthe whole into a solid mass almost capable of resisting a penknife.\r\nThus secured, they defy the elements and brave the blasts of winter\r\nuninjured.--The female of _Hypogymna dispar_, whose eggs have a\r\nmore tender shell, glues them in an oval mass to the stem of a tree\r\n(whence the German gardeners call the larvæ _Stamm-raupe_), and then\r\ncovers them with a warm non-conducting coat of hairs plucked from her\r\nown body, equally impervious to cold and wet.\r\n\r\nAnother of those beautiful relations between objects at first sight\r\napparently unconnected, which at every step reward the votaries of\r\nEntomology, is afforded by the coincidence between the period of\r\nthe hatching in spring of eggs deposited before winter, and of the\r\nleafing of the trees upon which they have been fixed, and on whose\r\nfoliage the larvæ are to feed: which two events, requiring exactly\r\nthe same temperature, are always simultaneous. Of this fact I have\r\nhad a striking exemplification the last spring (1816). On the 20th\r\nof February, observing the twigs of the birches in the Hull Botanic\r\nGarden to be thickly set, especially about the buds, with minute oval\r\nblack eggs of some insect with which I was unacquainted, I brought\r\nhome a small branch and set it in a jar of water in my study, in\r\nwhich is a fire daily, to watch their exclusion. On the 28th of March\r\nI observed that a numerous brood of Aphides (not _A. Betulæ_, as the\r\nwings were without the dark bands of that species) had been hatched\r\nfrom them, and that two or three of the lower buds had expanded into\r\nleaves, upon the sap of which they were greedily feasting. This was\r\nfull a month before either a leaf of the birch appeared, or the egg\r\nof an Aphis was disclosed in the open air.--To view the relation\r\nof which I am speaking with due admiration, you must bear in mind\r\nthe extremely different periods at which many trees acquire their\r\nleaves, and the consequent difference demanded in the constitution\r\nof the eggs which hybernate upon dissimilar species, to ensure their\r\nexclusion, though acted upon by the _same_ temperature, earlier or\r\nlater, according to the early or late foliation of these species.\r\nThere is no visible difference between the conformation of the\r\neggs of the Aphis of the birch and those of the Aphis of the ash;\r\nyet in the _same_ exposure those of the former shall be hatched,\r\nsimultaneously with the expansion of the leaves, nearly a month\r\nearlier than those of the latter: thus demonstrably proving that the\r\nhybernation of these eggs is not accidental, but has been specially\r\nordained by the Author of nature, who has conferred on those of each\r\nspecies a peculiar and appropriate organization.\r\n\r\nA much greater number of insects pass the winter in the _pupa_\r\nthan in the egg state; probably nine-tenths of the extensive order\r\n_Lepidoptera_, many in _Hymenoptera_, and several in other orders.\r\nIn placing these pupæ in security from the too great cold of winter\r\nand the attacks of enemies, the larvæ from which they are to be\r\nmetamorphosed exhibit an anxiety and ingenuity evidently imparted\r\nto them for this express design. A few are suspended without any\r\ncovering, though usually in a sheltered situation. But by far the\r\nlarger number are concealed under leaves, in the crevices or in\r\nthe trunk of trees, &c., or inclosed in cocoons of silk or other\r\nmaterials which will be described to you in a subsequent letter,\r\nand often buried deep under ground out of the reach of frost.--One\r\nreason why so many lepidopterous insects pass the winter as pupæ,\r\nhas been plausibly assigned by Rösel, in remarking that this is the\r\ncase with all the numerous species which feed on annual plants. As\r\nthese have no local habitation, dying one year and springing up from\r\nseed in another quarter the next, it is obvious that eggs deposited\r\nupon them in autumn would have no chance of escaping destruction;\r\nand that even if the larvæ were to be hatched before winter, and to\r\nhybernate in that state, they would have no certainty of being in\r\nthe neighbourhood of their appropriate food the next spring. By\r\nwintering in the pupa state, these accidents are effectually provided\r\nagainst. The perfect insect is not ready to break forth until the\r\nfood of the young, which are to proceed from its eggs, is sprung up.\r\n\r\nTo the insects which hybernate in the _larva_ state, of course belong,\r\nin the first place, all those which exist under that form more than one\r\nyear; as many _Melolonthæ_, _Elateres_, _Cerambyces_, _Buprestes_, and\r\nseveral species of _Libellula_, _Ephemera_, &c. There are also many\r\nlarvæ which, though their term of life is not a year, being hatched\r\nfrom the egg in autumn, necessarily pass the winter in that state, as\r\nthose of several _Anobia_ and other wood-boring insects; of _Semasia\r\nWœberana_ and others of the same family; of the second broods of\r\nseveral butterflies, &c. Many of these residing in the ground or in the\r\ninterior of trees need no other hybernacula than the holes which they\r\nconstantly inhabit; some, as the aquatic larvæ, merely hide themselves\r\nin the sides or muddy bottom of their native pools; while others\r\nseek for a retreat under moss, dead leaves, stones, and the bark of\r\ndecaying trees. Most of these can boast of no better winter quarters\r\nthan a simple unfurnished hole or cavity; but a few, more provident of\r\ncomfort, prepare themselves an artificial habitation. With this view\r\nthe larva of _Cossus ligniperda_, as formerly observed in describing\r\nthe habitations of insects[717], forms a covering of pieces of wood\r\nlined with fine silk; those of _Hepiolus Humuli_, _Xylina radicea_,\r\nand some other moths, excavate under a stone a cavity exactly the size\r\nof their bodies, to which they give all round a coating of silk[718],\r\nand the larvæ of _Pieris Cratægi_ inclose themselves in autumn in cases\r\nof the same material[719], and thus pass the cold season in small\r\nsocieties of from two to twelve, under a common covering formed of\r\nleaves. Bonnet mentions a trait of the cleanliness of these insects\r\nwhich is almost ludicrous. He observed in one of these nests a sort of\r\nsack containing nothing but grains of excrement; and a friend assured\r\nhim that he had seen one of these caterpillars partly protrude itself\r\nout of its case, the hind feet first, to eject a similar grain; so that\r\nit would seem the society have on their establishment a scavenger,\r\nwhose business it is to sweep the streets and convey the rejectamenta\r\nto one grand repository[720]! This, however singular, is rendered not\r\nimprobable from the fact that beavers dig in their habitations holes\r\nsolely destined for a like purpose[721].\r\n\r\nA very considerable number of insects hybernate in the _perfect_\r\nstate, chiefly of the orders _Coleoptera_, _Hemiptera_,\r\n_Hymenoptera_, and _Diptera_, and especially of the first. _Vanessa\r\nUrticæ_, _Io_, and a few other lepidopterous species, with a small\r\nproportion of the other orders, occasionally survive the winter;\r\nbut the bulk of these are rarely found to hybernate as perfect\r\ninsects. Of coleopterous insects, Schmid, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor some valuable remarks on the present subject[722], says that\r\nhe never found or heard of any Entomologist finding a hybernating\r\nindividual of the common cockchafer (_Melolontha vulgaris_) or of the\r\nstag-beetle (_Lucanus Cervus_); and suggests that it is only those\r\ninsects which exist but a short period as larvæ, as most of the tribe\r\nof weevils, lady-birds, &c., that survive the winter in the perfect\r\nstate; while those which live more than one year in the larva state,\r\nas the species just mentioned, are deprived of this privilege.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of autumn the whole insect world, particularly the\r\ntribe of beetles, is in motion. A general migration takes place:\r\nthe various species quit their usual haunts, and betake themselves\r\nin search of secure hybernacula. Different species, however, do not\r\nselect precisely the same time for making this change of abode. Thus\r\nmany lady-birds, field-bugs, and flies, are found out of their winter\r\nquarters even after the commencement of frost; while others, as Schmid\r\nhas remarked, make good their retreat long before any severe cold has\r\nbeen felt: in fact, I am led to believe, from my own observations,\r\nthat this is the case with the majority of coleopterous insects; and\r\nthat the days which they select for retiring to their hybernacula,\r\nare some of the warmest days of autumn, when they may be seen in\r\ngreat numbers alighting on walls, rails, path-ways, &c. and running\r\ninto crevices and cracks, evidently in search of some object very\r\ndifferent from those which ordinarily guide their movements. I have\r\nnoticed this assemblage in different years, but more particularly in\r\nthe last autumn (1816). Walking on the banks of the Humber on the\r\n14th of October about noon,--the day bright, calm, and deliciously\r\nmild, Fahrenheit's thermometer 58° in the shade,--my attention was\r\nfirst attracted by the path-ways swarming with numerous species of\r\nrove-beetles (_Staphylinus_, _Oxytelus_, _Aleochara_, &c.), which\r\nkept incessantly alighting, and hurrying about in every direction. On\r\nfurther examination I found a similar assemblage, with the addition\r\nof multitudes of other beetles, _Halticæ_, _Nitidulæ_, _Rhyncophora_,\r\n_Cryptophagi_, &c. on every post and rail in my walk, as well as on\r\na wall in the neighbourhood; and on removing the decaying mortar and\r\nbark, I found that some had already taken up their abode in holes, from\r\ntheir situation with their antennæ folded, evidently meant for winter\r\nquarters. I am not aware that any author has noticed this remarkable\r\ncongregation of coleopterous insects previously to hybernating, which\r\nit is so difficult to explain on any of the received theories of\r\ntorpidity, except the pious Lesser, who so expressly alludes to it, and\r\nwithout quoting any other authority, that he would seem to have derived\r\nthe fact from his own observation[723].\r\n\r\nThe site chosen by different perfect insects for their hybernacula\r\nis very various. Some are content with insinuating themselves\r\nunder any large stone, a collection of dead leaves, or the moss\r\nof the sheltered side of an old wall or bank. Others prefer for a\r\nretreat the lichen or ivy-covered interstices of the bark of old\r\ntrees, the decayed bark itself, especially that near the roots, or\r\nbury themselves deep in the rotten trunk; and a very great number\r\npenetrate into the earth to the depth of several inches. The aquatic\r\ntribes, such as _Dytisci_, _Hydrophili_, &c. burrow into the mud\r\nof their pools; but some of these are occasionally met with under\r\nstones, bark, &c. In every instance the selected dormitory is\r\nadmirably adapted to the constitution, mode of life, and wants of\r\nthe occupant. Those insects which can bear considerable cold without\r\ninjury, are careless of providing other than a slight covering; while\r\nthe more tender species either enter the earth beyond the reach of\r\nfrost, or prepare for themselves artificial cavities in substances\r\nsuch as moss and rotten wood, which conduct heat with difficulty,\r\nand defend them from an injuriously low temperature. It does not\r\nappear that any perfect insect has the faculty of fabricating for\r\nitself a winter abode similar to those formed of silk, &c. by some\r\nlarvæ. Schmid, indeed, has mentioned finding _Rhagium mordax_ and\r\n_Inquisitor_ in such abodes, constructed, as he thought, of the\r\ninner bark of trees; but these, as Illiger has suggested, were more\r\nprobably the deserted dwellings of lepidopterous larvæ, of which the\r\nbeetles in question had taken possession[724].--Most insects place\r\nthemselves in their hybernacula in the attitude which they ordinarily\r\nassume when at rest; but others choose a position peculiar to their\r\nwinter abode. So most of the ground-beetles (_Eutrechina_) adhere by\r\ntheir claws to the under side of the stone, which serves for their\r\nretreat, their backs being next to the ground; in which posture,\r\nprobably, they are most effectually protected from wet. _Gyrohypnus\r\nsanguinolentus_, and other rove-beetles of the same genus, coils\r\nitself up like a snake, with the head in the centre.\r\n\r\nThe majority of insects pass the winter in perfect solitude.\r\nOccasionally, however, several individuals of one species, not merely\r\nof such insects as _Anchomenus prasinus_, a beetle, _Pyrrhocoris\r\napterus_, a bug, &c., which usually in summer also live in a sort of\r\nsociety, but of others which are never seen thus to associate, as\r\n_Haltica oleracea_, _Carabus intricatus_, and several _Coccinellæ_, &c.\r\nare found crowded together. This is perhaps often more through accident\r\nthan design, as individuals of the same species are frequently met with\r\nsingly; yet that it is not wholly accidental, seems proved by the fact\r\nthat such assemblages are generally of the same genus and even species.\r\nSometimes, however, insects of dissimilar genera and even orders are\r\nmet with together. Schmid once in February found the rare _Lomechusa\r\nstrumosa_ torpid in an ant-hill in the midst of a conglomerated lump of\r\nants, with which it was closely intertwined[725].\r\n\r\nBy far the greater proportion of insects pass the winter only in one\r\nor other of the several states of egg, pupa, larva, or imago, but are\r\nnever found to hybernate in _more_ than one. Some species, however,\r\ndepart from this rule. Thus _Aphis Rosæ_, _Cardui_, and probably many\r\nothers of the genus, hybernate both in the egg and perfect state[726];\r\n_Cinthia Cardui_, _Gonepteryx Rhamni_, and some other species, usually\r\nin the pupa, but often in the perfect state also; and _Vanessa Io_,\r\naccording to the accurate Brahm, in the three states of egg, pupa, and\r\nimago[727]. It is probable that in these instances the perfect insects\r\nare females, which, not having been impregnated, have their term of\r\nlife prolonged beyond the ordinary period.\r\n\r\nThe first cold weather, after insects have entered their winter\r\nquarters, produces effects upon them similar to those which occur in\r\nthe dormouse, hedgehog, and others of the larger animals subject to\r\ntorpor. At first a partial benumbment takes place; but the insect\r\nif touched is still capable of moving its organs. But as the cold\r\nincreases all the animal functions cease. The insect breathes no\r\nlonger, and has no need of a supply of air[728]; its nutritive\r\nsecretions cease, and no more food is required; the muscles lose\r\ntheir irritability[729]; and it has all the external symptoms of\r\ndeath. In this state it continues during the existence of great cold,\r\nbut the degree of its torpidity varies with the temperature of the\r\natmosphere. The recurrence of a mild day, such as we sometimes have\r\nin winter, infuses a partial animation into the stiffened animal: if\r\ndisturbed, its limbs and antennæ resume their power of extension, and\r\neven the faculty of spirting out their defensive fluid is re-acquired\r\nby many beetles[730]. But however mild the atmosphere in winter, the\r\ngreat bulk of hybernating insects, as if conscious of the deceptious\r\nnature of their pleasurable feelings, and that no food could then be\r\nprocured, never quit their quarters, but quietly wait for a renewal\r\nof their insensibility by a fresh accession of cold.\r\n\r\nOn this head I have had an opportunity of making some observations\r\nwhich, in the paucity of recorded facts on the hybernation of insects,\r\nyou may not be sorry to have laid before you. The 2nd of December 1816\r\nwas even finer than many of the preceding days of the season, which so\r\nhappily falsified the predictions that the unprecedented dismal summer\r\nwould be followed by a severe winter. The thermometer was 46° in the\r\nshade; not a breath of air was stirring; and a bright sun imparted\r\nanimation to troops of the winter gnat (_Trichocera hiemalis_), which\r\nfrisked under every bush; to numerous _Psychodæ_; and even to the\r\nflesh-fly, of which two or three individuals buzzed past me while\r\ndigging in my garden. Yet though these insects, which I shall shortly\r\nadvert to as exceptions to the general rule, were thus active, the\r\nheat was not sufficient to induce their hybernating brethren to quit\r\ntheir retreats. Removing some of the dead bark of an old apple-tree,\r\nI soon discovered several insects in their winter quarters. Of the\r\nlittle beetle _Lebia quadrinotata_, Duftschmid _Faun. Austr._ (_Carabus\r\npunctomaculatus_, Ent. Brit.), I found six or eight individuals, and\r\nall so lively, that though remaining perfectly quiet in their abode\r\nuntil disturbed, they ran about with their ordinary activity as soon\r\nas the covering of bark was displaced. The same was the case with a\r\ncolony of earwigs. Two or three individuals of _Lebia quadrimaculata_\r\nshowed more torpidity. When first uncovered, their antennæ were\r\nlaid back; and it was only after the sun had shone some seconds upon\r\nthem that they exhibited symptoms of animation, and after stretching\r\nout these organs began to walk. Close by them lay a single weevil\r\n(_Anthonomus Pomorum_), but in so deep a sleep that at first I thought\r\nit dead. It gave no sign of life when placed on my hand, quite hot with\r\nthe exercise of digging; and it was only after being kept there some\r\nseconds, and breathed upon several times, that it first slowly unfolded\r\nits rostrum, and then its limbs. It deserves remark, that all these\r\ninsects, thus differently affected, were on the same side of the tree,\r\nunder a similar covering of bark, and apparently equally exposed to the\r\nsun, which shone full upon the covering of their retreat[731].\r\n\r\nAll insects, however, do not undergo this degree of torpidity. In\r\nfact, there are some, though but few, which cannot, at least in our\r\nclimate, strictly be said to hybernate, understanding by that term\r\npassing the winter in one selected situation in a greater or less\r\ndegree of torpor, without food. Not to mention _Cheimatobia brumata_,\r\nand some other moths, which are disclosed from the pupæ in the middle\r\nof winter, and can therefore be scarcely regarded as exceptions\r\nto the rule, some insects are torpid only in very severe weather,\r\nand on fine mild days in winter come out to eat. This is the case\r\nwith the larva of _Euprepia fuliginosa_[732]; and Lyonet asserts\r\nthat there are many other caterpillars which eat and grow even in\r\nthe midst of slight frost[733]. Amongst perfect insects, troops of\r\n_Trichocera hiemalis_, the gnat whose choral dances have been before\r\ndescribed[734], may be constantly seen gamboling in the air in the\r\ndepth of winter when it is mild and calm, accompanied by the little\r\n_Psychoda_, so common in windows, several _Muscidæ_, spiders, and\r\noccasionally some _Aphodii_ and _Staphylinidæ_: and the societies of\r\nants, as well as their attendant Aphides, are in motion and take more\r\nor less food during the whole of that season when the cold is not\r\nintense. The younger Huber informs us that ants become torpid only at\r\n2° Reaum. below freezing (27° Fahrenheit), and apparently endeavour\r\nto preserve themselves from the cold, when its approach is gradual,\r\nby clustering together. When the temperature is above this point\r\nthey follow their ordinary habits (he has seen them even walk upon\r\nthe snow), and can then obtain the little food which they require in\r\nwinter from their cows the Aphides, which, by an admirable provision,\r\nbecome lethargic at precisely the same degree of cold as the ants,\r\nand awake at the same period with them[735].\r\n\r\nLastly, there are some few insects which do not seem ever to be\r\ntorpid, as _Podura nivalis_, L., and the singular apterous insect\r\nrecently described by Dalman, _Chionea araneoïdes_[736], both of\r\nwhich run with agility on the snow itself; and the common hive-bee;\r\nthough with regard to the precise state in which this last passes the\r\nwinter, this part of its economy has not been made the subject of\r\nsuch accurate investigation as is desirable.\r\n\r\nMany authors have conceived that it is the most natural state of bees\r\nin winter to be perfectly torpid at a certain degree of cold, and\r\nthat their partial reviviscency, and consequent need of food in our\r\nclimate, are owing to its variableness and often comparative mildness\r\nin winter; whence they have advised placing bees during this season\r\nin an ice-house, or on the north side of a wall, where the degree\r\nof cold being more uniform, and thus their torpidity undisturbed,\r\nthey imagine no food would be required. So far, however, do these\r\nsuppositions and conclusions seem from being warranted, that Huber\r\nexpressly affirms that, instead of being torpid in winter, the\r\nheat in a well-peopled hive continues +24° or 25° of Reaumur (86°\r\nFahrenheit), when it is several degrees below zero in the open air;\r\nthat they then cluster together and keep themselves _in motion_ in\r\norder to preserve their heat[737]; and that in the depth of winter\r\nthey do not cease to ventilate the hive by the singular process of\r\nagitating their wings before described[738]. He asserts also that,\r\nlike Reaumur, he has in winter found in the combs brood of all ages;\r\nwhich, too, the observant Bonnet says he has witnessed[739]; and\r\nwhich is confirmed by Swammerdam, who expressly states that bees tend\r\nand feed their young even in the midst of winter[740]. To all these\r\nweighty authorities may be added that of John Hunter, who, as before\r\nnoticed, found a hive to grow lighter in a cold than in a warm week\r\nof winter; and that a hive from November 10th to February 9th lost\r\nmore than four pounds in weight[741]; whence the conclusion seems\r\ninevitable, that bees do eat in winter.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Reaumur adopts (or rather, perhaps, has in great\r\nmeasure given birth to) the more commonly received notion, that\r\nbees in a certain degree of cold are torpid and consume no food.\r\nThese are his words:--\"It has been established with a wisdom which\r\nwe cannot but admire,--with that wisdom with which every thing in\r\nnature has been made and ordained,--that during the greater part of\r\nthe time in which the country furnishes nothing to bees, they have no\r\nlonger need to eat. The cold which arrests the vegetation of plants,\r\nwhich deprives our fields and meadows of their flowers, throws the\r\nbees into a state in which nourishment ceases to be necessary to\r\nthem: it keeps them in a sort of torpidity (_engourdissement_), in\r\nwhich no transpiration from them takes place; or, at least, during\r\nwhich the quantity of that which transpires is so inconsiderable,\r\nthat it cannot be restored by aliment without their lives being\r\nendangered. In winter, while it freezes, one may observe without fear\r\nthe interior of hives that are not of glass; for we may lay them on\r\ntheir sides, and even turn them bottom upwards, without putting any\r\nbee into motion. We see the bees crowded and closely pressed one\r\nagainst the other: little space then suffices for them[742].\" In\r\nanother place, speaking of the custom in some countries of putting\r\nbee-hives during winter into out-houses and cellars, he says that\r\nin such situations the air, though more temperate than out of doors\r\nduring the greater part of winter, \"is yet sufficiently cold to keep\r\nthe bees in that species of torpidity which does away their need\r\nof eating[743].\" And lastly, he expressly says that the milder the\r\nweather, the more risk there is of the bees consuming their honey\r\nbefore the spring, and dying of hunger; and confirms his assertion\r\nby an account of a striking experiment, in which a hive that he\r\ntransferred during winter into his study, where the temperature was\r\nusually in the day 10° or 12° R. above freezing (59° F.), though\r\nprovided with a plentiful supply of honey, that if they had been in\r\na garden would have served them past the end of April, had consumed\r\nnearly their whole stock before the end of February[744].\r\n\r\nNow, how are we to reconcile this contradiction?--for, if Huber be\r\ncorrect in asserting that in frosty weather bees agitate themselves\r\nto keep off the cold, and ventilate their hive;--if, as both he\r\nand Swammerdam state, they feed their young brood in the depth of\r\nwinter--it seems impossible to admit that they ever can be in the\r\ntorpid condition which Reaumur supposes, in which food, so far from\r\nbeing necessary, is injurious to them. In fact, Reaumur himself in\r\nanother place informs us, that bees are so infinitely more sensible\r\nof cold than the generality of insects, that they perish when in\r\nnumbers so small as to be unable to generate sufficient animal heat\r\nto counteract the external cold, even at 11° R. above freezing[745]\r\n(57° F.); which corresponds with what Huber has observed (as quoted\r\nabove) of the high temperature of well-peopled hives, even in very\r\nsevere weather. We are forced, then, to conclude that this usually\r\nmost accurate of observers has in the present instance been led into\r\nerror, chiefly, it is probable, from the clustering of bees in the\r\nhives in cold weather; but which, instead of being, as he conceived,\r\nan indication of torpidity, would seem to be intended, as Huber\r\nasserts, as a preservative against the benumbing effects of cold.\r\n\r\nBees, then, do not appear to pass the winter in a state of torpidity\r\nin our climates, and probably not in any others. Populous swarms\r\ninhabiting hives formed of the hollow trunks of trees, used in many\r\nnorthern regions, or of other materials that are bad conductors of\r\nheat, seem able to generate and keep up a temperature sufficient to\r\ncounteract the intensest cold to which they are ordinarily exposed.\r\nAt the same time, however, I think we may infer, that though bees\r\nare not strictly torpid at that lowest degree of heat which they\r\ncan sustain, yet that when exposed to _that_ degree they consume\r\nconsiderably less food than at a higher temperature; and consequently\r\nthat the plan of placing hives in a north aspect in sunny and\r\nmild winters may be adopted by the apiarist with advantage. John\r\nHunter's experiment, indeed, cited above, in which he found that a\r\nhive grew lighter in a cold than in a warm week, seems opposed to\r\nthis conclusion; but an insulated observation of this kind, which\r\nwe do not know to have been instituted with a due regard to all\r\nthe circumstances that required attention, must not be allowed to\r\nset aside the striking facts of a contrary description recorded by\r\nReaumur and corroborated by the almost universal sentiment of writers\r\non bees.--After all, however, on this point, as well as on many\r\nothers connected with the winter economy of these endlessly-wonderful\r\ninsects, there is evidently much yet to be observed, and many doubts\r\nwhich can be satisfactorily dispelled only by new experiments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe degree of cold which most insects in their different states,\r\nwhile torpid, are able to endure with impunity, is very various; and\r\nthe habits of the different species, as to the situation which they\r\nselect to pass the winter, are regulated by their greater or less\r\nsensibility in this respect. Many insects, though able to sustain a\r\ndegree of cold sufficient to induce torpidity, would be destroyed\r\nby the freezing temperature, to avoid which they penetrate into the\r\nearth or hide themselves under non-conducting substances; and there\r\ncan be little doubt that it is with this view that so many species\r\nwhile pupæ are thus secured from cold by cocoons of silk or other\r\nmaterials. Yet a very great proportion of insects in all their states\r\nare necessarily subjected to an extreme degree of cold. Many eggs\r\nand pupæ are exposed to the air without any covering; and many,\r\nboth larvæ and perfect insects, are sheltered too slightly to be\r\nsecure from the frost. This they are either able to resist, remaining\r\nunfrozen though exposed to the severest cold, or, which is still more\r\nsurprising, are uninjured by its intensest action, recovering their\r\nvitality even after having been frozen into lumps of ice.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of insects are filled with a fluid matter, included in a\r\nskin infinitely thinner than that of hens' eggs, which John Hunter\r\nfound to freeze at about 15° of Fahrenheit. Yet on exposing several\r\nof the former, including those of the silk-worm, for five hours to\r\na freezing mixture which made Fahrenheit's thermometer fall to 38°\r\nbelow zero, Spallanzani found that they were not frozen, nor their\r\nfertility in the slightest degree impaired. Others were exposed even\r\nto 56° below zero, without being injured[746].\r\n\r\nA less degree of cold suffices to freeze many pupæ and larvæ, in both\r\nwhich states the consistency of the animal is almost as fluid as in\r\nthat of the egg. Their vitality enables them to resist it to a certain\r\nextent, and it must be considerably below the freezing point to affect\r\nthem. The winter of 1813-14 was one of the severest we have had for\r\nmany years, Fahrenheit's thermometer having been more than once as low\r\nas 8° when the ground was wholly free from snow; yet almost the first\r\nobjects which I observed in my garden, in the commencement of spring,\r\nwere numbers of the caterpillars of the gooseberry-moth (_Abraxas\r\ngrossulariata_), which, though they had passed the winter with no other\r\nshelter than the slightly projecting rim of some large garden-pots,\r\nwere alive and quite uninjured; and these and many other larvæ never\r\nin my recollection were so numerous and destructive as in that spring:\r\nwhence, as well as from the corresponding fact recorded with surprise\r\nby Boerhaave, that insects abounded as much after the intense winter\r\nof 1709, during which Fahrenheit's thermometer fell to 0, as after the\r\nmildest season, we may see the fallacy of the popular notion, that hard\r\nwinters are destructive to insects[747].\r\n\r\nBut though many larvæ and pupæ are able to resist a great degree\r\nof cold, when it increases to a certain extent they yield to its\r\nintensity and become solid masses of ice. In this state we should\r\nthink it impossible that they should ever revive. That an animal\r\nwhose juices, muscles, and whole body have been subjected to a\r\nprocess which splits bombshells, and converted into an icy mass\r\nthat may be snapped asunder like a piece of glass, should ever\r\nrecover its vital powers, seems at first view little less than a\r\nmiracle; and, if the reviviscency of the wheel animal (_Vorticella\r\nrotatoria_), and of snails, &c. after years of desiccation, had not\r\nmade us familiar with similar prodigies, might have been pronounced\r\nimpossible; and it is probable that many insects when thus frozen\r\nnever do revive. Of the fact, however, as to several species, there\r\nis no doubt. It was first noticed by Lister, who relates that he\r\nhad found caterpillars so frozen, that when dropped into a glass\r\nthey chinked like stones, which nevertheless revived[748]. Reaumur,\r\nindeed, repeated this experiment without success; and found that\r\nwhen the larvæ of _Lasiocampa Pityocampa_ were frozen into ice by\r\na cold of 15° R. below zero (2° F. below zero), they could not be\r\nmade to revive[749]. But other trials have fully confirmed Lister's\r\nobservations. My friend Mr. Stickney, before mentioned as the author\r\nof a valuable _Essay on the Grub_ (larva of _Tipula oleracea_)--to\r\nascertain the effect of cold in destroying this insect, exposed\r\nsome of them to a severe frost, which congealed them into perfect\r\nmasses of ice. When broken, their whole interior was found to be\r\nfrozen. Yet several of these resumed their active powers. Bonnet had\r\nprecisely the same result with the pupæ of _Pontia Brassicæ_, which,\r\nby exposing to a frost of 14° R. below zero (0° F.), became lumps of\r\nice, and yet produced butterflies[750]. Indeed, the circumstance that\r\nanimals of a much more complex organization than insects, namely,\r\nserpents and fishes, have been known to revive after being frozen,\r\nis sufficient to dispel any doubts on this head. John Hunter, though\r\nhimself unsuccessful in his attempts to reanimate carp and other\r\nanimals that had been frozen, confesses that the fact itself is so\r\nwell authenticated as to admit of no question[751].\r\n\r\nOn what principle a faculty so extraordinary and so contrary to our\r\ncommon conceptions of the nature of animal life depends, I shall not\r\nattempt to explain. Nor can any thing very satisfactory be advanced\r\nwith regard to the source of the power which many insects in some\r\nstates, and almost all in the egg state, have of resisting intense\r\ndegrees of cold without becoming frozen. It is clear that the usual\r\nexplanation of the same faculty to a less degree in the warm-blooded\r\nanimals--the constant production of animal heat from the caloric set\r\nfree in the decomposition of the respired air--will not avail us\r\nhere. For, first, the hive-bee, which has the capacity of evolving\r\nanimal heat in a much greater degree than any other insect, is\r\nkilled by a cold considerably less than that of freezing. Secondly,\r\nmany large larvæ, as Reaumur has observed, are destroyed by a less\r\ndegree of cold than smaller species whose respiratory organization\r\nis necessarily on a much less extensive scale. And thirdly, the eggs\r\nof insects--in which, though they probably are in some degree acted\r\nupon by the oxygen of the atmosphere, nothing like respiration takes\r\nplace--can endure a much greater intensity of cold than either the\r\nlarvæ or pupæ produced from them.\r\n\r\nNor can we refer the effect in question to the thinness or\r\nthickness--the greater or less non-conducting power--of the skin of\r\nthe animal. Reaumur found that the subterranean pupæ of many moths\r\nperished with a cold of 7° or 8° R. below zero (14° F.), while the\r\nexposed pupæ of _Pontia Brassicæ_ and other species endured 15° or\r\n16° without injury[752]; (a proof, by the way, that the different\r\neconomy of these insects, as to their choice of a situation in their\r\nstate of pupæ, is regulated by their power of resisting cold;) but\r\nno difference in the substance of the exterior skin is perceptible.\r\nAnd the eggs of insects have usually thinner skins than pupæ, and yet\r\nthey are unaffected by a degree of cold much superior.\r\n\r\nIn the present state, then, of our knowledge of animal physiology,\r\nwe must confess our ignorance of the cause of these phenomena,\r\nwhich seem never to have been sufficiently adverted to by general\r\nspeculators on the nature of animal heat. We may conjecture, indeed,\r\neither that they are owing to some peculiar and varying attraction\r\nfor caloric inherent in the fluids which compose the animal, and\r\nwhich in the egg state, like spirit of wine, resist our utmost\r\nproducible artificial cold; or that, as John Hunter seems to infer\r\nwith respect to a similar faculty in a minor degree in the hen's egg,\r\nthe whole are to be referred to some unknown power of vitality. The\r\nlatter seems the most probable supposition; for Spallanzani found\r\nthat the blood of marmots, which remains fluid when they are exposed\r\nto a cold several degrees below zero of Fahrenheit, freezes at a\r\nmuch higher temperature when drawn from the animal[753]; and it is\r\nreasonable to conjecture that the same result would follow if the\r\nfluids filling the eggs of insects were collected separately, and\r\nthen exposed to severe cold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpring is, of course, the period when insects shake off the four\r\nor five months' sleep which has sweetly banished winter from their\r\ncalendar, quit their dormitories, and again enter the active scenes\r\nof life. It is impossible to deny that the increased temperature\r\nof this season is the immediate cause of their reappearance; for\r\nthey leave their retreats much earlier in forward than in backward\r\nsprings. Thus in the early spring of 1805 (to me a memorable one,\r\nsince in it I began my entomological career, and had anxiously\r\nwatched its first approaches in order to study practically the\r\nscience of which I had gained some theoretical knowledge in the\r\nwinter,) insects were generally out by the middle of March; and\r\nbefore the 30th, I find, on referring to my entomological journal,\r\nthat I had taken and investigated (I scarcely need add, not always\r\nwith a correct result,) fifty-eight coleopterous species: while in\r\nthe last untoward spring (1816) I did not observe even a bee abroad\r\nuntil the 20th of April; and the first butterfly that I saw did not\r\nappear until the 26th.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, circumstances connected with this reappearance,\r\nwhich seem to prove that something _more_ than the mere sensation\r\nof warmth is concerned in causing it. I shall not insist upon the\r\nremarkable fact which Spallanzani has noticed, that insects reappear\r\nin spring at a temperature considerably lower than that at which\r\nthey retired in autumn; because it may be plausibly enough explained\r\nby reference to their increased irritability in spring, the result\r\nof so long an abstinence from food, and their consequent augmented\r\nsensibility to the stimulus of heat. But if the mere perception of\r\nwarmth were the sole cause of insects ceasing to hybernate, then we\r\nmight fairly infer, that species of apparently similar organization,\r\nand placed in similar circumstances, would leave their winter\r\nquarters at the same time. This, however, is far from being the case.\r\nReaumur observed that the larvæ of _Melitæa Cinxia_ quitted their\r\nnest a full month sooner than those of _Arctia chrysorrhea_[754].\r\nThe reason is obvious; but cannot be referred to mere sensation.\r\nThe former live on grass, and on the leaves of plantain, which\r\nthey can meet with at the beginning of March--the period of their\r\nappearance: the latter eat only the leaves of trees which expand a\r\nmonth later. It might, indeed, be still contended, that this fact\r\nis susceptible of explanation by supposing that the organization\r\nof these two species of larva, though apparently similar, is yet\r\nin fact different, that of the one being constituted so as to be\r\nacted upon by a less degree of heat than that of the other: and this\r\nsolution would be satisfactory if the torpidity of these larvæ were\r\nuninterrupted up to the very period at which they quit their nest.\r\nBut facts do not warrant any such supposition. You have seen[755]\r\nthat the temperature of a mild day even in winter awakens many\r\ninsects from their torpidity, though without inducing them to leave\r\ntheir hybernacula; and it is therefore highly improbable that the\r\nlarvæ of _A. chrysorrhea_ should not often have their torpid state\r\nrelaxed during the month of March, when we have almost constantly\r\noccasional bright days elevating the thermometer to above 50°. Yet as\r\nthey still do not, like the larvæ of _M. Cinxia_, leave their nest,\r\nit seems obvious that something more than the sensation of heat is\r\nthe regulator of the movements of each. Not, however, to detain you\r\nhere unnecessarily, I shall not enlarge at present on this point,\r\nbut shall pass on, in concluding this letter, to advert to the\r\ncauses which have been assigned for the hybernation and torpidity of\r\nanimals, and to state my own ideas on the subject, which will equally\r\napply to the termination of this condition in spring.\r\n\r\nThe authors who have treated on these phenomena have generally[756]\r\nreferred them to the operation of cold upon the animals in which\r\nthey are witnessed, but acting in a different manner. Some conceive\r\nthat cold combined with a degree of fatness arising from abundance\r\nof food in autumn, produces in them an agreeable sensation of\r\ndrowsiness, such as we know, from the experience of Sir Joseph Banks\r\nand Dr. Solander in Terra del Fuego, as well as from other facts,\r\nis felt by man when exposed to a very low temperature; yielding to\r\nwhich, torpidity ensues. Others, admitting that cold is the cause of\r\ntorpidity, maintain that the sensations which precede it are of a\r\npainful nature; and that the retreats in which hybernating animals\r\npass the winter are selected in consequence of their endeavours to\r\nescape from the disagreeable influence of cold.\r\n\r\nI have before had occasion to remark[757] the inconclusiveness of\r\nmany of the physiological speculations of very eminent philosophers,\r\narising from their ignorance of Entomology, which observation\r\nforcibly applies in the present instance. The reasoners upon\r\ntorpidity have almost all confined their view to the hybernating\r\nquadrupeds, as the marmot, dormouse, &c. and have thus lost sight\r\nof the far more extensive series of facts supplied by hybernating\r\ninsects, which would often at once have set aside their most\r\nconfidently-asserted hypotheses. If those who adopt the former of\r\nthe opinions above alluded to, had been aware that numerous insects\r\nretire to their hybernacula (as has been before observed) on some\r\nof the finest days at the close of autumn, they could never have\r\ncontended that this movement, in which insects display extraordinary\r\nactivity, is caused by the agreeable _drowsiness_ consequent on\r\nsevere cold; and the very same fact is equally conclusive against the\r\ntheory, that it is to escape the pain arising from a low temperature\r\nthat insects bury themselves in their winter quarters.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the great source of the confused and unsatisfactory\r\nreasoning which has obtained on this subject, is, that no author, as\r\nfar as my knowledge extends, has kept steadily in view, or indeed\r\nhas distinctly perceived, the difference between torpidity and\r\nhybernation; or, in other words, between the _state_ in which animals\r\npass the winter, and their _selection_ of a _situation_ in which they\r\nmay become subject to that state.\r\n\r\nThat the torpidity of insects, as well as of other hybernating animals,\r\nis caused by cold, is unquestionable. However early the period at\r\nwhich a beetle, for example, takes up its winter quarters, it does not\r\nsuffer that cessation of the powers of active life which we understand\r\nby torpidity, until a certain degree of cold has been experienced; the\r\ndegree of its torpidity varies with the variations of temperature; and\r\nthere can be no doubt that, if it were kept during winter from the\r\ninfluence of cold, it would not become torpid at all--at least this has\r\nproved the fact with marmots and dormice thus treated; and the Aphis\r\nof the rose (_A. Rosæ_), which becomes torpid in winter in the open\r\nair[758], retains its activity and gives birth to a numerous progeny\r\nupon rose trees preserved in greenhouses and warm apartments.\r\n\r\nBut, can we, in the same way, regard mere cold as the cause of the\r\n_hybernation_ of insects? Is it wholly owing to this agent, as most\r\nwriters seem to think--to feelings either of a pleasurable or painful\r\nnature produced by it--that _previously_ to becoming torpid they\r\nselect or fabricate commodious retreats precisely adapted to the\r\nconstitution and wants of different species, in which they quietly\r\nwait the accession of torpidity and pass the winter? In my opinion,\r\ncertainly not.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if sensations proceeding from cold lead insects to\r\nselect retreats for hybernating, how comes it that, as above shown, a\r\nlarge proportion of them enter these retreats before any severe cold\r\nhas been felt, and on days considerably warmer than many that preceded\r\nthem? If this supposition have any meaning, it must imply that insects\r\nare so constituted that, when a certain degree of cold has been felt by\r\nthem, the sensations which this feeling excites impel them to seek out\r\nhybernacula. Now the thermometer in the shade on the 14th of October\r\n1816, when I observed vast numbers thus employed, was at 58°:--this\r\nthen, on the theory in question, is a temperature sufficiently low to\r\ninduce the requisite sensations. But it so happens, as I learn from my\r\nmeteorological journal (which registers the greatest and least daily\r\ntemperature as indicated by a Six's thermometer), that on the 31st of\r\nAugust 1816 the greatest heat was not more than 52°, or six degrees\r\nlower than on the 14th of October: yet it was six weeks later that\r\ninsects retired for the winter!\r\n\r\nBut it may be objected, that it is perhaps not so much the precise\r\ndegree of cold prevailing on the day when insects select their\r\nhybernacula, that regulates their movements, as the lower degree\r\nwhich may have obtained for a few nights previously, and which may\r\nact upon their delicate organization so as to influence their future\r\nproceedings. Facts, however, are again in direct opposition to the\r\nexplanation; for I find that, for a week previously to the 14th of\r\nOctober 1816, the thermometer was never lower at night than 48°,\r\nwhile in the first week of August it was twice as low as 46°, and\r\nnever higher than 50°.[759]\r\n\r\nAs a last resource, the advocates of the doctrine I am opposing, may\r\nurge, that possibly insects may even have their sensations affected\r\nby the cold some days _before_ it comes on, in the same way as we\r\nknow that spiders and some other animals are influenced by changes of\r\nweather previously to their actual occurrence. But once more I refer\r\nto my meteorological journal; and I find that the average lowest\r\nheight of the thermometer, in the week comprising the latter end of\r\nOctober and beginning of November 1816, was 43-1/7°; while in the\r\nweek comprising the same days of the month of the end of August and\r\nbeginning of September it was only 44-5/7°--a difference surely too\r\ninconsiderable to build a theory upon.\r\n\r\nI have entered into this tedious detail, because it is of importance\r\nto the spirit of true philosophizing to show what little agreement\r\nthere often is between facts and many of the hypotheses, which\r\nauthors of the present day are, from their determination to explain\r\nevery thing, led to promulgate. But in truth there was no absolute\r\nneed for imposing this fatigue upon your attention; for the single\r\nnotorious consideration that in this climate, as well as in more\r\nsouthern ones, we not unfrequently have sharp night-frosts in summer,\r\nand colder weather at that season than in the latter end of autumn\r\nand beginning of winter, and yet that insects _do_ hybernate at the\r\nlatter period, but do _not_ at the former, is an ample refutation\r\nof the notion that mere cold is the cause of the phenomenon. If,\r\nindeed, the hybernacula of insects were simply the underside of any\r\ndead leaf, clod, or stone, that chanced to be in the neighbourhood of\r\ntheir abode, it might still be contended, that such situations were\r\n_always_ resorted to by them on the occurrence of a certain degree\r\nof cold, but that they remained in them only when its continuance\r\nhad induced torpidity: and it seems to have been in this view that\r\nmost reasoners on this subject have regarded the hybernation of\r\nthe larger animals, to which they have exclusively directed their\r\nattention. But had they been acquainted (as surely the investigators\r\nof such a question ought to have been) with the economy of the class\r\nof insects, in which not merely a few species, as among quadrupeds,\r\nbut ninety-nine hundredths of the whole, in our climates, hybernate,\r\nthey would have known that their hybernacula are in general totally\r\ndistinct from their ordinary retreats in casual cold weather; and\r\nthat many of them even fabricate habitations requiring considerable\r\ntime and labour, expressly for the purpose of their winter\r\nresidence--which last fact in particular, on their theory, admits\r\nof no satisfactory explanation. We may say, and truly, that the\r\nsensation of fatigue causes man to lie down and sleep; but we should\r\nlaugh at any one who contended that this sensation forced him first\r\nto make a four-post bedstead to repose upon.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, if we grant for a moment that it is cold which\r\ndrives insects to their hybernacula, there are other phenomena\r\nattending the state of hybernation which on this supposition are\r\ninexplicable. If cold led insects to enter their winter quarters, then\r\nthey ought to be led by the cessation of cold to quit them. But, as has\r\nbeen before observed, we have often days in winter milder than at the\r\nperiod of hybernating, and in which insects are so roused from their\r\ntorpidity as to run about nimbly when molested in their retreats; yet\r\nthough their irritability must have been increased by a two or three\r\nmonths inactivity and abstinence, they do not leave them, but quietly\r\nremain until a fresh accession of cold again induces insensibility.\r\n\r\nIn short, to refer the hybernation of insects to the mere direct\r\ninfluence of cold, is to suppose one of the most important acts of\r\ntheir existence given up to the blind guidance of feelings which in\r\nthe variable climates of Europe would be leading them into perpetual\r\nand fatal errors--which in spring would be inducing them to quit\r\ntheir ordinary occupations, and prepare retreats and habitations for\r\nwinter to be quitted again as soon as a few fine days had dispelled\r\nthe frosty feel of a May week; and in a mild winter's day, when the\r\nthermometer, as is often the case, rises to 50° or 55°, would lure\r\nthem to an exposure that must destroy them. It is not, we may rest\r\nassured, to such a deceptious guide that the Creator has intrusted\r\nthe safety of so important a part of his creatures: their destinies\r\nare regulated by feelings far less liable to err.\r\n\r\nWhat, you will ask, is this regulator? I answer _Instinct_--that\r\nfaculty to which so many other of the equally surprising actions of\r\ninsects are to be referred; and which alone can adequately account\r\nfor the phenomena to be explained. Why, indeed, should we think\r\nit necessary to go further? We are content to refer to instinct,\r\nthe retirement of insects into the earth previously to becoming\r\npupæ, and the cocoons which they then fabricate; and why should we\r\nnot attribute to the same energy, their retreat into appropriate\r\nhybernacula, and the construction by many species of habitations\r\nexpressly destined for their winter residence! The cases are exactly\r\nanalogous; and the insect knows no more that its hybernaculum is\r\nto protect it from too severe a degree of cold during winter, than\r\ndoes the full-fed caterpillar when it enters the earth that it shall\r\nemerge a glorious butterfly.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[717] VOL.

The last week of January 1817,\r\nin the neighbourhood of Hull, was most delicious weather--calm, sunny,\r\ndry, and genial--the wind south-west, the thermometer from 47° to 52°\r\nevery day, and at night rarely below 40°; in fact, a week much finer\r\nthan we can often boast of in May: the 27th of the month was the\r\nmost delightful day of the whole: the air swarmed with _Trichocera\r\nhiemalis_, _Psychodæ_, and numerous other _Diptera_, and the bushes\r\nwere hung with the lines of the gossamer-spider as in autumn. Yet,\r\nwith the exception of _Aphodius contaminatus_, I did not observe\r\na single coleopterous insect on the wing, nor even an individual\r\ntempted to crawl on the trunks of the trees, under the dead bark of\r\nwhich I found many in a very lively state. Five or six individuals of\r\n_Haltica Nemorum_ were still very lethargic; and two of _Geotrupes\r\nstercorarius_, which I accidentally dug up from their hybernacula in\r\nthe earth at the depth of six or eight inches, though the _Acari_ upon\r\nthem were quite alert, exhibited every symptom of complete torpor.\r\n\r\n[732] Brahm, _Ins.

I. 32.\r\n\r\n[758] Kyber in Germar's _Mag. der Ent._ ii. 3.\r\n\r\n[759] Since the publication of the first edition of this volume, I\r\nhave had an opportunity of making some observations which strongly\r\ncorroborate the above reasoning. The month of October in the present\r\nyear (1817) set in extremely cold. From the 1st to the 6th, piercing\r\nnorth and north-west winds blew; the thermometer at Hull, though the\r\nsun shone brightly, in the day-time was never higher than from 52°\r\nto 56°, nor at night than 38°; in fact, on the 1st and 3rd it sunk\r\nas low as 34°, and on the 2nd to 31°: and on those days, at eight in\r\nthe morning, the grass was covered with a white hoar frost; in short,\r\nto every one's feelings the weather indicated December rather than\r\nOctober. Here then was every condition fulfilled that the theory I am\r\nopposing can require; consequently, according to that theory, such a\r\nstate of the atmosphere should have driven every hybernating insect\r\nto its winter quarters. But so far was this from being the case, that\r\non the 5th, when I made an excursion purposely to ascertain the fact,\r\nI found all the insects still abroad which I had met with six weeks\r\nbefore in similar situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LETTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n                     _ON THE INSTINCT OF INSECTS._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater part of those surprising facts connected with the\r\nmanners and economy of insects, of which the relation has occupied\r\nthe preceding letters, is to be referred, I have told you, to their\r\ninstinct. But _what_, you will ask, is this instinct?--of what nature\r\nis this faculty which produces effects so extraordinary?\r\n\r\nTo this query I do not pretend to give any satisfactory answer. As I\r\nam quite of Bonnet's opinion, that philosophers will in vain torment\r\nthemselves to define instinct, until they have spent some time in the\r\nhead of an animal without actually _being_ that animal--a species\r\nof metempsychosis through which I have never passed--I shall not\r\nattempt to explain what this mysterious energy _is_. It will not,\r\nhowever, I imagine, be very difficult to show what it is _not_; and\r\nsome observations with this view, followed by an enumeration of\r\npeculiarities which distinguish the instincts of insects from those of\r\nother tribes of animals, and a short inquiry whether their actions are\r\nguided solely by instinct, will form the substance of this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. It is quite superfluous at this day to controvert the explanations\r\nof instinct advanced by some of the philosophers of the old school,\r\nsuch as that of Cudworth, who referred this faculty to a certain\r\n_plastic nature_; or that of Des Cartes, who contended that animals\r\nare mere _machines_. Nor, I fancy, would you thank me for entering\r\ninto an elaborate refutation of the doctrine of Mylius, that many of\r\nthe actions deemed instinctive are the effect of painful corporeal\r\nfeelings; the cocoon of a caterpillar, for instance, being the result\r\nof a fit of the colic, produced by a superabundance of the gum which\r\nfills its silk-bags, and which exuding, is twisted round it, by its\r\nuneasy contortions, into a regular ball. Still less need I advert to\r\nthe notable discovery of some pupils of Professor Winckler, that the\r\nbrain, alias the soul, of a bee or spider, is impressed at the birth\r\nof the insect with certain geometrical figures, according to which\r\nmodels its works are constructed,--a position which these gentlemen\r\ndemonstrate very satisfactorily by a memorable experiment in which\r\nthey themselves were able to _hear triangles_.\r\n\r\nIt is as unnecessary to waste any words in refutation of the nonsense\r\n(for it deserves no better name) of Buffon, who refers the instinct\r\nof societies of insects to the circumstance of a great number of\r\nindividuals being brought into existence at the same time, all acting\r\nwith equal force, and obliged by the similarity of their internal and\r\nexternal structure, and the conformity of their movements, to perform\r\neach the same actions, in the same place, in the most convenient mode\r\nfor themselves, and least inconvenient for their companions; whence\r\nresults a regular, well-proportioned, and symmetrical structure:\r\nand he gravely tells us that the boasted hexagonal cells of bees are\r\nproduced by the reciprocal pressure of the cylindrical bodies of\r\nthese insects against each other[760]!!\r\n\r\nNor is it requisite to advert at length to the explanations of\r\ninstinctive actions more recently given by Steffens, a German\r\nauthor (one of the transcendentalists, I conclude, from the\r\nincomprehensibility of his book to my ordinary intellect), who\r\nsays that the products of the vaunted instinct of insects are\r\nnothing but \"shootings out of inorganic animal masses\" (_anorgische\r\nanschüsse_)[761]; and by Lamarck[762], who attributes them to\r\ncertain inherent inclinations arising from habits impressed upon the\r\norgans of the animals concerned in producing them, by the constant\r\nefflux towards these organs of the nervous fluid, which during a\r\nseries of ages has been displaced in their endeavours to perform\r\ncertain actions which their necessities have given birth to. The\r\nmere statement of an hypothesis of which the enunciation is nearly\r\nunintelligible, and built upon the assumption of the presence of\r\nan unseen fluid, and of the existence of the animal some millions\r\nof years, is quite sufficient, and would even be unnecessary if it\r\nwere not of such late origin. Neither shall I detain you with any\r\nformal consideration of the hypothesis advanced by Addison and some\r\nother authors, that instinct is an immediate and constant impulse of\r\nthe Deity; which, to omit other obvious objections, is sufficiently\r\nrefuted by the fact, that animals in their instincts are sometimes at\r\nfault, and commit mistakes, which on the above supposition could not\r\nin any case happen.\r\n\r\nThe only doctrine on the subject of instinct requiring any thing\r\nlike a formal refutation, is that which, contending for the identity\r\nof this faculty with reason in man, maintains that all the actions\r\nof animals, however complicated, are, like those of the human race,\r\nthe result of observation, invention, and experience. This theory,\r\nmaintained by the sceptics, Pythagoras, Plato, and some other ancient\r\nphilosophers, and in modern times by Helvetius, Condillac, and\r\nSmellie, has been by none more ingeniously supported than by Dr.\r\nDarwin, who in the chapter treating on instinct, in the first volume\r\nof his _Zoonomia_, has brought forward a collection of facts which\r\ngive it a great air of plausibility. This plausibility, however, is\r\nmerely superficial; and the result of a rigorous examination by any\r\ncompetent judge is, that the greater part of Dr. Darwin's facts bear\r\nmore strongly in favour of the dissimilarity of instinct and reason\r\nthan of their identity: and that those few which seem to support the\r\nlatter position, are built upon the relations of persons ignorant\r\nof natural history, who have confused together distinct species\r\nof animals. Thus, because some anonymous informant told him that\r\nhive-bees when transported to Barbadoes, where there is no winter,\r\nceased to lay up a store of honey, Dr. Darwin infers that all the\r\noperations of these insects are guided by reason and the adaptation\r\nof means to an end--a very just inference, if the statement from\r\nwhich it is drawn were accurate; but that it is not so, is known to\r\nevery naturalist acquainted with the fact that many different species\r\nof bees store up honey in the hottest climates; and that there is no\r\nauthentic instance on record of the hive-bees' altering in any age\r\nor climate their peculiar operations, which are now in the coldest\r\nand in the hottest regions precisely what they were in Greece in the\r\ntime of Aristotle, and in Italy in the days of Virgil. Indeed the\r\nsingle fact, depending on the assertions of such accurate observers\r\nas Reaumur and Swammerdam, that a bee as soon after it is disclosed\r\nfrom the pupa as its body is dried and its wings expanded, and before\r\nit is possible that it should have received any instruction, betakes\r\nitself to the collecting of honey or the fabrication of a cell, which\r\noperations it performs as adroitly as the most hoary inhabitant\r\nof the hive, is alone sufficient to set aside all the hear-say\r\nstatements of Dr. Darwin, and should have led him, as it must every\r\nlogical reasoner, to the conclusion, that these and similar actions\r\nof animals cannot be referred to any reasoning process, nor be deemed\r\nthe result of observation and experience.--It is true, it does not\r\nfollow that animals, besides instinct, have not, in a degree, the\r\nfaculty of reason also; and as I shall in the sequel endeavour to\r\nshow, many of the actions of insects can be adequately explained on\r\nno other supposition. But to deny, as Dr. Darwin does, that the art\r\nwith which the caterpillar weaves its cocoon, or the unerring care\r\nwith which the moth places her eggs upon food that she herself can\r\nnever use, are the effects of instinct, is as unphilosophical and\r\ncontrary to fact, as to insist that the eagerness with which, though\r\nit has never tasted milk, the infant seeks for its mother's breast,\r\nis the effect of reason.\r\n\r\nInstinct, then, is _not_ the result of a plastic nature; of a system\r\nof machinery; of diseased bodily action; of models impressed on the\r\nbrain; nor of organic shootings-out:--it is not the effect of the\r\nhabitual determination for ages of the nervous fluid to certain\r\norgans; nor is it either the impulse of the Deity, or reason. Without\r\npretending to give a logical definition of it, which while we are\r\nignorant of the essence of reason is impossible, we may call the\r\ninstincts of animals those unknown faculties implanted in their\r\nconstitution by the Creator, by which, independent of instruction,\r\nobservation, or experience, and without a knowledge of the end\r\nin view, they are impelled to the performance of certain actions\r\ntending to the well-being of the individual and the preservation\r\nof the species: and with this description, which is in fact merely\r\na confession of ignorance, we must, in the present state of\r\nmetaphysical science, content ourselves.\r\n\r\nI here say nothing of that supposed connexion of the instinct of\r\nanimals with their _sensations_, which has been introduced into many\r\ndefinitions of this mysterious power, for two reasons. In the first\r\nplace, this definition merely sets the world upon the tortoise; for\r\nwhat do we know more than before about the nature of instinct, when\r\nwe have called it, with Brown, a predisposition to certain actions\r\nwhen certain sensations exist, or with Tucker have ascribed it to the\r\noperation of the senses, or to that internal feeling called appetite?\r\nBut, secondly, this connexion of instinct with bodily sensation, though\r\nprobable enough in some instances, is by no means generally evident.\r\nWe may explain in this way the instincts connected with hunger and\r\nthe sexual passion, and some other particular facts, as the laying\r\nof the eggs of the flesh-fly in the flowers of _Stapelia hirsuta_,\r\ninstead of in carrion their proper nidus, and of those of the common\r\nhouse-fly in snuff[763] instead of dung; for in these instances the\r\nsmell seems so clearly the guide, that it even leads into error. But\r\nwhat connexion between sensation and instinct do we see in the conduct\r\nof the working-bees, which fabricate some of the cells in a comb larger\r\nthan others, expressly to contain the eggs and future grubs of drones,\r\nthough these eggs are not laid by themselves, and are still in the\r\novaries of the queen? So we may plausibly enough conjecture that the\r\nfury with which, in ordinary circumstances, at a certain period of the\r\nyear, the working-bees are inspired towards the drones, is the effect\r\nof some disagreeable smell or emanation proceeding from them at that\r\nparticular time: but how can we explain, on similar grounds, the fact\r\nthat in a hive deprived of a queen, no massacre of the drones takes\r\nplace? Lastly, to omit here a hundred other instances, as many of them\r\nwill be subsequently adverted to, if we may with some show of reason\r\nsuppose that it is the sensation of heat which causes bees to swarm;\r\nyet what possible conception can we form of its being bodily sensations\r\nthat lead bees to send out scouts in search of a hive suitable for the\r\nnew colony, several days _before_ swarming?\r\n\r\nAfter these observations on the nature of instinct, generally, I\r\npass on to contrast in several particulars the instincts of insects\r\nwith those of other animals; and thus to bring together some\r\nremarkable instances of the former which have not hitherto been laid\r\nbefore you, as well as to deduce from some of those already related,\r\ninferences to which it did not fall in with my design before to\r\ndirect your attention. This contrast may be conveniently made under\r\nthe three heads of--the exquisiteness of their instincts--their\r\nnumber--and their extraordinary development.\r\n\r\nThe instincts of by far the majority of the superior animals are of\r\na very simple kind, only directing them to select suitable food; to\r\npropagate their species; to defend themselves and their young from\r\nharm; to express their sensations by various vocal modulations; and\r\nto a few other actions which need not be particularized. Others\r\nof the larger animals, in addition to these simpler instinctive\r\npropensities, are gifted with more extensive powers; storing up food\r\nfor their winter consumption, and building nests or habitations for\r\ntheir young, which they carefully feed and tend.\r\n\r\nAll these instincts are common to insects, a great proportion of\r\nwhich are in like manner confined to these. But a very considerable\r\nnumber of this class are endowed with instincts of an _exquisiteness_\r\nto which the higher animals can lay no claim. What bird or fish, for\r\nexample, catches its prey by means of nets as artfully woven and\r\nas admirably adapted to their purposes as any that ever fisherman\r\nor fowler fabricated? Yet such nets are constructed by the race of\r\nspiders. What beast of prey thinks of digging a pit-fall in the track\r\nof the animals which serve it for food, and at the bottom of which\r\nit conceals itself, patiently waiting until some unhappy victim\r\nis precipitated down the sides of its cavern? Yet this is done by\r\nthe ant-lion and another insect. Or, to omit the endless instances\r\nfurnished by wasps, ants, the Termites, &c., what animals can be\r\nadduced which, like the hive-bee associating in societies, build\r\nregular cities composed of cells formed with geometrical precision,\r\ndivided into dwellings adapted in capacity to different orders of\r\nthe society, and storehouses for containing a supply of provision?\r\nEven the erections of the beaver, and the pensile dwelling of the\r\ntailor-bird, must be referred to a less elaborate instinct than that\r\nwhich guides the procedures of these little insects--the complexness\r\nand yet perfection of whose operations, when contrasted with the\r\ninsignificance of the architect, have at all times caused the\r\nreflecting observer to be lost in astonishment.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the _deviations_ of the instincts of insects and\r\ntheir _accommodation to circumstances_, that the exquisiteness of\r\nthese faculties is most decidedly manifested. The instincts of the\r\nlarger animals seem capable of but slight modification. They are\r\neither exercised in their full extent or not at all. A bird, when\r\nits nest is pulled out of a bush, though it should be laid uninjured\r\nclose by, never attempts to replace it in its situation; it contents\r\nitself with building another. But insects in similar contingencies\r\noften exhibit the most ingenious resources, their instincts\r\nsurprisingly accommodating themselves to the new circumstances\r\nin which they are placed, in a manner more wonderful and\r\nincomprehensible than the existence of the faculties themselves. Take\r\na honey-comb, for instance. If _every_ comb that bees fabricate were\r\n_always_ made _precisely_ alike--with the same general form, placed\r\nin the same position, the cells all exactly similar, or where varying\r\nwith the variations always alike;--this structure would perhaps\r\nin reality be not more astonishing than many of a much simpler\r\nconformation. But when we know that in nine instances out of ten the\r\ncombs in a bee-hive are thus similar in their properties, and yet\r\nthat in the tenth one shall be found of a form altogether peculiar;\r\nplaced in a different position; with cells of a different shape--and\r\nall these variations evidently adapted to some new circumstance not\r\npresent when the other nine were constructed,--we are constrained to\r\nadmit that nothing in the instinct of other animals can be adduced,\r\nexhibiting similar exquisiteness: just as we must confess an ordinary\r\nloom, however ingeniously contrived, far excelled by one capable of\r\nrepairing its defects when out of order.\r\n\r\nThe examples of this variation and accommodation to circumstances among\r\ninsects are very numerous; and as presenting many interesting facts in\r\ntheir history not before related, I shall not fear wearying you with a\r\npretty copious detail of them, beginning with the more simple.\r\n\r\nIt is the instinct of _Geotrupes vernalis_ to roll up pellets of\r\ndung, in each of which it deposits one of its eggs; and in places\r\nwhere it meets with cow- or horse-dung only, it is constantly under\r\nthe necessity of having recourse to this process. But in districts\r\nwhere sheep are kept, this beetle wisely saves its labour, and\r\ningeniously avails itself of the pellet-shaped balls ready made to\r\nits hands which the excrement of these animals supplies[764].\r\n\r\nA caterpillar described by Bonnet, which from being confined in\r\na box was unable to obtain a supply of the bark with which its\r\nordinary instinct directs it to make its cocoon, substituted pieces\r\nof paper that were given to it, tied them together with silk, and\r\nconstructed a very passable cocoon with them.--In another instance the\r\nsame naturalist having opened several cocoons of a moth (_Cucullia\r\nVerbasci_), which are composed of a mixture of grains of earth and\r\nsilk, just after being finished; the larvæ did not repair the injury in\r\nthe same manner. Some employed both earth and silk; others contented\r\nthemselves with spinning a silken veil before the opening[765].\r\n\r\nThe larva of the cabbage-butterfly (_Pontia Brassicæ_) when about to\r\nassume the pupa state, commonly fixes itself to the under-side of\r\nthe coping of a wall or some similar projection. But the ends of the\r\nslender thread which serves for its girth would not adhere firmly\r\nto stone or brick, or even wood. In such situations, therefore, it\r\npreviously covers a space of about an inch long and half an inch\r\nbroad with a web of silk, and to this extensive base its girth can be\r\nsecurely fastened. That this proceeding, however, is not the result\r\nof a blind unaccommodating instinct, seems proved by a fact which has\r\ncome under my own observation. Having fed some of these larvæ in a\r\nbox covered by a piece of muslin, they attached themselves to this\r\ncovering; but as its texture afforded a firm hold to their girth,\r\nthey span _no_ preparatory web.\r\n\r\n_Bombus_[766] _Muscorum_ and some other species of humble-bees cover\r\ntheir nests with a roof of moss. M. P. Huber having placed a nest\r\nof the former under a bell glass, he stuffed the interstices between\r\nits bottom and the irregular surface on which it rested, with a linen\r\ncloth. This cloth, the bees, finding themselves in a situation where\r\nno moss was to be had, tore thread from thread, carded it with their\r\nfeet into a felted mass, and applied it to the same purpose as moss,\r\nfor which it was nearly as well adapted.--Some other humble-bees tore\r\nthe cover of a book with which he had closed the top of the box that\r\ncontained them, and made use of the detached morsels in covering\r\ntheir nest[767].\r\n\r\nThe larva of _Cossus ligniperda_, which feeds in the interior of trees,\r\npreviously to fabricating a cocoon and assuming the pupa state, forms\r\nfor the egress of the future moth a cylindrical orifice, except when it\r\nfinds a suitable hole ready made. When the moth is about to appear, the\r\nchrysalis with its anterior end forces an opening in the cocoon. If the\r\norifice in the tree has been formed by itself, in which case it exactly\r\nfits its body, it _entirely_ quits the cocoon, and pushes itself half\r\nway out of the hole, where it remains secure from falling until the\r\nmoth is disclosed. But if the orifice, having been adopted, be larger\r\nthan it ought to have been, and thus not capable of supporting the\r\npupa in this position, the provident insect pushes itself only _half\r\nway_ out of the cocoon, which thus serves for the support which in the\r\nformer case the wood itself afforded[768].\r\n\r\nThe variations in the procedures of the larva of a little\r\nmoth described by Reaumur, whose habitation has been before\r\nnoticed[769]--one of those which constantly reside in a\r\nsubcylindrical case--are still more remarkable. This little\r\ncaterpillar feeds upon the elm, the leaves of which serve it at\r\nonce for food and clothing. It eats the parenchyma or inner pulp,\r\nburrowing between the upper and under membranes, of portions of which\r\ncut out, and properly sewed together, it forms its case. Its usual\r\nplan is, to insinuate itself between the epidermal membranes of the\r\nleaf, close to one of the edges. Parallel with this it excavates a\r\ncavity of suitable form and dimensions, gnawing the pulp even out\r\nof every projection of the serratures, but carefully avoiding to\r\nseparate the membranes at the very edge, which with a wise saving of\r\nlabour it intends should form one of the seams of its coat; and as\r\nthe little miner is not embarrassed with the removal of the excavated\r\nmaterials, which it swallows as it proceeds, a cavity sufficiently\r\nlarge is but the work of a few hours. It then lines it with silk, at\r\nthe same time pushing it into a more cylindrical shape; and lastly,\r\ncutting it off at the two ends and inner side, it sews up the latter\r\nwith such nicety that the suture is scarcely discoverable; and is\r\nnow provided with a case or coat exactly fitting its body, open at\r\nthe two ends, by one of which it feeds and by the other discharges\r\nits excrement, having on one side a nicely-joined seam, and the\r\nother--that which is commonly applied to its back--composed of the\r\nnatural marginal junction of the membranes of the leaf.\r\n\r\nSuch are the ordinary operations of this insect, which, when it is\r\nconsidered that the case is rather fusiform than cylindrical; that\r\nthe end through which it eats is circular, and the other curiously\r\nthree-cornered like a cocked-hat; and that consequently its cloth\r\nrequires to be very irregularly and artfully cut, to be accommodated\r\nto such a figure--it must be admitted, are the result of an instinct\r\nof no very simple kind. Complicated, however, as these manœuvres\r\nseem, our ingenious workman is not confined to them. By way of\r\nputting its resources to the test, Reaumur cut off the serrated edge\r\nfrom the nearly-finished coat of one of them, and exposed the little\r\noccupant to the day. He expected that it would have quitted its\r\nmutilated garment and commenced another; and so it certainly would,\r\nhad it been guided by an invariable instinct. But he calculated\r\nerroneously. Like one of its brother tailors of the biped race, it\r\nknew how \"to cut its coat according to its cloth,\" and immediately\r\nsetting about repairing the injury sewed up the rent. Nor was this\r\nall. The scissors having cut off one of the projections intended to\r\nenter into the construction of the triangular end of its case, it\r\nentirely changed the original plan, and made that end the head which\r\nhad been first designed for the tail.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Reaumur observed one of these larvæ to cut out\r\nits coat from the very centre of a leaf, where it is obvious a series\r\nof operations wholly different must be adopted, the two membranes\r\ncomposing it necessarily requiring to be cut and sewed on _two_\r\nsides instead of on one only. But what was most striking in this new\r\nprocedure was the alteration which the caterpillar made in the period\r\nof sewing up its garment. When these larvæ cut out their case from\r\nthe edge of a leaf, they seem aware that, if they were to detach it\r\nentirely from the inner side before the process of sewing, lining,\r\n&c., is completed, having no support on the exterior edge, it would\r\nbe liable to fall down; at the same time they could not sew together\r\nthe membranes composing it at the _inner_ side, without cutting them\r\nin part from the leaf. While, therefore, they divide the major part\r\nof their inner side from the leaf, they artfully leave them attached\r\nto it by one of the large nerves at each end: and these supports they\r\ndo not cut asunder until the intermediate space has been sewed up,\r\nand they are ready to step, with their house on their back, upon the\r\n_terra firma_ of the disk of the leaf. In this instance, therefore,\r\nthe larvæ do not wholly separate their case from the leaf, until it is\r\nsewed. But when the same larvæ cut out their materials from the middle\r\nof the leaf, where, though completely cut round, they are retained in\r\ntheir situation secure from all danger of falling by the serratures of\r\nthe incisions made by the jaws of the larvæ, these little tailors vary\r\ntheir mode, and _entirely_ detach the pieces from the surrounding leaf,\r\nbefore they proceed to set a stitch into them[770].\r\n\r\nIn the preceding instances the variation of instinct takes place\r\nin the same individual, but Bonnet mentions a very curious fact in\r\nwhich it occurs in different generations of the same species. There\r\nare annually, he informs us, two generations of the Angoumois moth,\r\nan insect which has been before mentioned[771], as destructive to\r\nwheat: the first appear in May and June, and lay their eggs upon\r\nthe ears of wheat in the fields; the second appear at the end of\r\nthe summer or in autumn, and these lay their eggs upon wheat in the\r\ngranaries. These last pass the winter in the state of larvæ, from\r\nwhich proceeds the first generation of moths. But what is extremely\r\nsingular as a variation of instinct, those moths which are disclosed\r\nin _May_ and _June_ in the granaries, quit them with a rapid flight\r\nat sun-set, and betake themselves to the yet unreaped fields, where\r\nthey lay their eggs; while the moths which are disclosed in the\r\ngranaries after harvest, stay there, and never attempt to go out, but\r\nlay their eggs upon the stored wheat[772].--This is as extraordinary\r\nand inexplicable as if a litter of rabbits produced in spring were\r\nimpelled by instinct to eat vegetables, while another produced in\r\nautumn should be as irresistibly directed to choose flesh.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, into the history of the hive-bee that we must look\r\nfor the most striking examples of variation of instinct; and here, as\r\nin every thing relating to this insect, the work of the elder Huber\r\nis an unfailing source of the most novel and interesting facts.\r\n\r\nIt is the ordinary instinct of bees to lay the foundation of\r\ntheir combs at the top of the hive, building them perpendicularly\r\n_downwards_; and they pursue this plan so constantly, that you might\r\nexamine a thousand (probably ten thousand) hives, without finding any\r\nmaterial deviation from it. Yet Huber in the course of his experiments\r\nforced them to build their combs perpendicularly upward[773]; and, what\r\nseems even more remarkable, in an horizontal direction[774].\r\n\r\nThe combs of bees are always at an uniform distance from each\r\nother, namely about one third of an inch, which is just wide\r\nenough to allow them to pass easily and have access to the young\r\nbrood. On the approach of winter, when their honey-cells are not\r\nsufficient in number to contain all the stock, they _elongate_ them\r\nconsiderably, and thus increase their capacity. By this extension\r\nthe intervals between the combs are unavoidably contracted; but in\r\nwinter well-stored magazines are essential, while from their state of\r\ncomparative inactivity spacious communications are less necessary.\r\nOn the return of spring, however, when the cells are wanted for the\r\nreception of eggs, the bees contract the elongated cells to their\r\nformer dimensions, and thus re-establish the just distances between\r\nthe combs which the care of their brood requires[775]. But this is\r\nnot all. Not only do they elongate the cells of the old combs when\r\nthere is an extraordinary harvest of honey, but they actually give to\r\nthe new cells which they construct on this emergency a much greater\r\n_diameter_ as well as a greater depth[776].\r\n\r\nThe queen-bee in ordinary circumstances places each egg in the\r\ncentre of the pyramidal bottom of the cell, where it remains fixed\r\nby its natural gluten: but in an experiment of Huber, one whose\r\nfecundation had been retarded, had the first segments of her abdomen\r\nso swelled that she was unable to reach the bottom of the cells. She\r\ntherefore attached her eggs (which were those of males) to their\r\nlower side, two lines from the mouth. As the larvæ always pass that\r\nstate in the place where they are deposited, those hatched from the\r\neggs in question remained in the situation assigned them. But the\r\nworking-bees, as if aware that in these circumstances the cells would\r\nbe too short to contain the larvæ when fully grown, _added to their\r\nlength_, even before the eggs were hatched[777].\r\n\r\nBees close up the cells of the grubs, previously to their\r\ntransformation, with a cover or lid of wax: and in hanging its abode\r\nwith a silken tapestry before it assumes the pupa state, the grub\r\nrequires that the cell should not be too short for its movements.\r\nBonnet having placed a swarm in a very flat glass hive, the bees\r\nconstructed one of the combs parallel to one of the principal sides,\r\nwhere it was so straight that they could not give to the cells their\r\nordinary depth. The queen, however, laid eggs in them, and the\r\nworkers daily nourished the grubs, and closed the cells at the period\r\nof transformation. A few days afterwards he was surprised to perceive\r\nin the lids, holes more or less large, out of which the grubs partly\r\nprojected, the cells having been too short to admit of their usual\r\nmovements. He was curious to know how the bees would proceed. He\r\nexpected that they would pull all the grubs out of the cells, as they\r\ncommonly do when great disorders in the combs take place. But he did\r\nnot sufficiently give credit to the resources of their instinct. They\r\ndid not displace a single grub--they left them in their cells: but\r\nas they saw that these cells were not deep enough, they closed them\r\nafresh with lids much more convex them ordinary, so as to give to\r\nthem a sufficient depth; and from that time no more holes were made\r\nin the lids.\r\n\r\nThe working bees, in closing up the cells containing larvæ, invariably\r\ngive a convex lid to the large cells of drones, and one nearly flat\r\nto the smaller cells of workers: but in an experiment instituted by\r\nHuber to ascertain the influence of the size of the cells on that of\r\nthe included larvæ, he transferred the larvæ of workers to the cells\r\nof drones. What was the result? Did the bees still continue blindly to\r\nexercise their ordinary instinct? On the contrary, they now placed a\r\nnearly _flat_ lid upon these large cells, as if well aware of their\r\nbeing occupied by a different race of inhabitants[778].\r\n\r\nOn some occasions bees, in consequence of Huber's arrangements in\r\nthe interior of their habitations, have begun to build a comb nearer\r\nto the adjoining one than the usual interval; but they soon appeared\r\nto perceive their error, and corrected it by giving to the comb a\r\ngradual curvature, so as to resume the ordinary distance[779].\r\n\r\nIn another instance, in which various irregularities had taken place\r\nin the form of the combs, the bees, in prolonging one of them, had,\r\ncontrary to their usual custom, begun two separate and distant\r\ncontinuations, which in approaching instead of joining would have\r\ninterfered with each other, had not the bees, apparently foreseeing the\r\ndifficulty, gradually bent their edges so as to make them join with\r\nsuch exactness that they could afterwards continue them conjointly[780].\r\n\r\nIn constructing their combs, bees, as you have been before told, in\r\nmy letter on the habitations of insects, form the first range of\r\ncells--that by which the comb is attached to the top of the hive--of\r\na different shape from the rest. Each cell instead of being hexagonal\r\nis pentagonal, having the fifth broadest side fixed to the top of\r\nthe hive, whence the comb is much more securely cemented to that\r\npart, than if the first range of cells had been of the ordinary\r\nconstruction. For some time after their fabrication, the combs remain\r\nin this state; but at a certain period the bees attack the first\r\nrange of cells as if in fury, gnaw away the sides without touching\r\nthe lozenge-shaped bottoms; and having mixed the wax with propolis,\r\nthey form a cement well known to the ancients under the names of\r\n_Mitys_, _Commosis_ and _Pissoceros_, which they substitute in the\r\nplace of the removed sides of the cells, forming of it thick and\r\nmassive walls and heavy and shapeless pillars, which they introduce\r\nbetween the comb and the top of the hive so as to agglutinate them\r\nfirmly together. Huber, who first in modern times witnessed this\r\nremarkable modification of the architecture of bees, observed, that\r\nnot only are they careful not to touch the bottoms of the cells, but\r\nthat they do not remove at once the cells on both sides of the comb,\r\nwhich in that case might fall down; but they work alternately, first\r\non one side and then on the other, replacing the demolished cells as\r\nthey proceed, with mitys, which firmly fixes the comb to its support.\r\n\r\nThe object of this substitution of mitys for wax seems clear. While\r\nthe combs are new and only partially filled with honey, the first\r\nrange of cells, originally established as the base and the guide for\r\nthe pyramidal bottoms of the subsequent ones, serves as a sufficient\r\nsupport for them. But when they contain a store of several pounds,\r\nthe bees seem to foresee the danger of such a weight proving too\r\nheavy for the thin waxen walls by which the combs are suspended, and\r\nprovidently hasten to substitute for them thicker walls, and pillars\r\nof a more compact and viscid material.\r\n\r\nBut their foresight does not stop here. When they have sufficient\r\nwax, they make their combs of such a breadth as to extend to the\r\nsides of the hive, to which they cement them by constructions\r\napproaching more or less to the shape of cells. But when a scarcity\r\nof wax happens before they have been able to give to their combs the\r\nrequisite diameter, a large vacant space is left between the edges\r\nof these combs, which are only fixed by their upper part, and the\r\nsides of the hive; and they might be pulled down by the weight of the\r\nhoney, did not the bees ensure their stability by introducing large\r\nirregular masses of wax between their edges and the sides of the\r\nhive.--A striking instance of this art of securing their magazines\r\noccurred to Huber. A comb, not having been originally well fastened\r\nto the top of his glass hive, fell down during the winter amongst\r\nthe other combs, preserving, however, its parallelism with them. The\r\nbees could not fill up the space between its upper edge and the top\r\nof the hive, because they never construct combs of old wax, and they\r\nhad not then an opportunity of procuring new: at a more favourable\r\nseason they would not have hesitated to build a new comb upon the\r\nold one; but it being inexpedient at that period to expend their\r\nprovision of honey in the elaboration of wax, they provided for the\r\nstability of the fallen comb by another process. They furnished\r\nthemselves with wax from the other combs, by gnawing away the rims of\r\nthe cells more elongated than the rest, and then betook themselves\r\nin crowds, some upon the edges of the fallen comb, others between\r\nits sides and those of the adjoining combs; and there securely fixed\r\nit, by constructing several _ties_ of different shapes between it\r\nand the glass of the hive; some were pillars, others buttresses, and\r\nothers beams artfully disposed and adapted to the localities of the\r\nsurfaces joined. Nor did they content themselves with repairing the\r\naccidents which their masonry had experienced; they provided against\r\nthose which might happen, and appeared to profit by the warning\r\ngiven by the fall of one of the combs to consolidate the others and\r\nprevent a second accident of the same nature. These last had not been\r\ndisplaced, and appeared solidly attached by their base; whence Huber\r\nwas not a little surprised to see the bees strengthen their principal\r\npoints of connexion by making them much thicker than before with old\r\nwax, and forming numerous ties and braces to unite them more closely\r\nto each other and to the walls of their habitation.--What was still\r\nmore extraordinary, all this happened in the middle of January, at a\r\nperiod when the bees ordinarily cluster at the top of the hive, and\r\ndo not engage in labours of this kind[781].\r\n\r\nYou will admit, I think, that these proofs of the resources of the\r\narchitectural instinct of bees are truly admirable. If, in the case\r\nof the substitution of mitys for the first range of waxen cells,\r\nthis procedure _invariably_ took place in _every_ bee-hive at a\r\n_fixed_ period--when, for example, the combs are two-thirds filled\r\nwith honey--it would be less surprising: but there is nothing of\r\nthis invariable character about it. It does not, as Huber expressly\r\ninforms us[782], occur at any marked and regular period, but appears\r\nto depend on several circumstances not always combined. Sometimes the\r\nbees content themselves with bordering the sides of the upper cells\r\nwith propolis alone, without altering their form or giving them greater\r\nthickness. And it is not less remarkable that, from the instances last\r\ncited, it appears that they are not confined to one kind of cement for\r\nstrengthening and supporting their combs, but avail themselves of\r\npropolis, wax, or a mixture of both, as circumstances direct.\r\n\r\nNot to weary you with examples of the modifications of instinct we are\r\nconsidering, I shall introduce but three more:--the first, of the mode\r\nin which bees extend the dimensions of an old comb; the second, of that\r\nwhich they adopt in constructing the male cells and connecting them\r\nwith the smaller cells of workers; and the last, of the plan pursued by\r\nthem when it becomes necessary to bend their combs.\r\n\r\nYou must have observed that a comb newly made becomes gradually thinner\r\nat its edges, the cells there, on each side, progressively decreasing\r\nin length: but in time these marginal cells, as they are wanted for\r\nthe purposes of the hive, are elongated to the depth of the rest. Now\r\nsuppose bees, from an augmentation of the size of their hive, to have\r\noccasion to extend their combs either in length or breadth, the process\r\nwhich they adopt is this: They gnaw away the tops of the marginal\r\ncells until the combs have resumed their original lenticular form, and\r\nthen construct upon their edges the pyramidal lozenge-shaped bottoms\r\nof cells, upon which the hexagonal sides are subsequently raised, as\r\nin their operation of cell-building. This course of proceeding is\r\ninvariable: they never extend a comb in any direction whatever, without\r\nhaving first made its edges thinner, diminishing its thickness in a\r\nportion sufficiently large to leave no angular projection.--Huber\r\nobserves, and with reason, in relating this surprising law which\r\nobliges bees partially to demolish the cells situated upon the edges\r\nof the combs, that it deserves a more close examination than he found\r\nhimself competent to give it: for, if we may to a certain point form\r\na conception of the instinct which leads these animals to employ\r\ntheir art of building cells, yet how can we conceive of that which in\r\nparticular circumstances forces them to act in an opposite direction,\r\nand determines them to _demolish_ what they have so laboriously\r\nconstructed[783]?\r\n\r\nDrones, or male bees, are more bulky than the workers; and you have\r\nbeen told, in speaking of the habitations of insects, that the\r\ncells which bees construct for rearing the larvæ of the former, are\r\nlarger than those destined for the education of the larvæ of the\r\nlatter. The diameter of the cells of drones is always 3-1/3 lines (or\r\ntwelfths of an inch); that of those of workers 2-2/5 lines: and these\r\ndimensions are so constant in their ordinary cells, that some authors\r\nhave thought they might be adopted as an universal and invariable\r\nscale of measure, which would have the great recommendation of\r\nbeing every where at hand, and at all events would be preferable to\r\nour _barley-corns_. Several ranges of male cells, sometimes from\r\nthirty to forty, are usually found in each comb, generally situated\r\nabout the middle. Now as these cells are not isolated, but form a\r\npart of the entire comb, corresponding on its two faces--by what\r\nart is it that the bees unite hexagonal cells of a small, with\r\nothers of a larger diameter, without leaving any void spaces, and\r\nwithout destroying the uniformity and regularity of the comb? This\r\nproblem would puzzle an ordinary artist, but is easily solved by the\r\nresources of the instinct of our little workmen.\r\n\r\nWhen they are desirous of constructing the cells of males below those\r\nof workers, they form several ranges of intermediate or transition\r\ncells, of which the diameter augments progressively, until they\r\nhave reached that range where the male cells commence; and in the\r\nsame manner, when they wish to revert to the modelling of the cells\r\nof workers, they pass by a gradually decreasing gradation to the\r\nordinary diameter of the cells of this class.--We commonly meet with\r\nthree or four ranges of intermediate cells before coming to those of\r\nmales; the first ranges of which participate in some measure in the\r\nirregularity of the former.\r\n\r\nBut it is upon the construction of the _bottoms_ of the intermediate\r\nranges of cells that this variation of their architecture chiefly\r\nhinges. The bottoms of the regular cells of bees are, as you are\r\naware, composed of _three_ equal-sized rhomboidal pieces; and the\r\nbase of a cell on one side of the comb is composed of portions of\r\nthe bases of _three_ cells on the other; but the bottoms of the\r\nintermediate cells in question (though their orifices are perfectly\r\nhexagonal) are composed of _four_ pieces, of which two are hexagonal\r\nand two rhomboidal; and each, instead of corresponding with three\r\ncells on the opposite side, corresponds with _four_. The size and\r\nthe shape of the four pieces composing the bottom, vary; and these\r\nintermediate cells, a little larger than the third part of the three\r\nopposite cells, comprise in their contour a portion of the bottom\r\nof the fourth cell. Just below the last range of cells with regular\r\npyramidal bottoms, are found cells with bottoms of four pieces, of\r\nwhich three are very large, and one very small, and this last is a\r\nrhomb. The two rhombs of the transition cells are separated by a\r\nconsiderable interval; but the two hexagonal pieces are adjacent and\r\nperfectly alike. A cell lower, we perceive that the two rhombs of\r\nthe bottom are not so unequal: the contour of the cell has included\r\na greater portion of the opposite fourth cell. Lastly, we find cells\r\nin pretty considerable number, of which the bottom is composed of\r\nfour pieces perfectly regular--namely, two elongated hexagons and\r\ntwo equal rhombs, but smaller than those of the pyramidal bottoms.\r\nIn proportion as we remove our view from the cells with regular\r\ntetrahedral bottoms, whether in descending or from right to left, we\r\nsee that the subsequent cells resume their ordinary form; that is to\r\nsay, that one of their rhombs is gradually lessened until it finally\r\ndisappears entirely; and the pyramidal form re-exhibits itself, but\r\non a larger scale than in the cells at the top of the comb. This\r\nregularity is maintained in a great number of ranges, namely, those\r\nconsisting of male cells; afterwards the cells diminish in size, and\r\nwe again remark the tetrahedral bottoms just described, until the\r\ncells have once more resumed the proper diameter of those of workers.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, by encroaching in a small degree upon the cells of the\r\nother face of the comb, that bees at length succeed in giving greater\r\ndimensions to their cells; and the graduation of the transition cells\r\nbeing reciprocal on the two faces of the comb, it follows that on\r\nboth sides each hexagonal contour corresponds with four cells.--When\r\nthe bees have arrived at any degree of this mode of operating, they\r\ncan stop there and continue to employ it in several consecutive\r\nranges of cells: but it is to the intermediate degree that they\r\nappear to confine themselves for the longest period, and we then\r\nfind a great number of cells of which the bottoms of four pieces are\r\nperfectly regular. They might, then, construct the whole comb on\r\nthis plan, if their object were not to revert to the pyramidal form\r\nwith which they set out.--In building the male cells, the bees begin\r\ntheir foundation with a block or mass of wax thicker and higher than\r\nthat employed for the cells of workers, without which it would be\r\nimpracticable for them to preserve the same order and symmetry in\r\nworking on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nIrregularities (to use the language of Huber, from whom the above\r\ndetails are abstracted,) have often been observed in the cells of bees.\r\nReaumur, Bonnet and other naturalists cite them as so many examples of\r\nimperfections. What would have been their astonishment if they had been\r\naware that part of these anomalies are _calculated_; that there exists\r\nas it were a moveable harmony in the mechanism by which the cells\r\nare composed! If, in consequence of the imperfection of their organs\r\nor of their instruments, bees occasionally constructed some of their\r\ncells unequal, or of parts badly put together, it would still manifest\r\nsome talent to be able to repair these defects, and to compensate one\r\nirregularity by another: but it is far more astonishing that they know\r\nhow to quit their ordinary routine when circumstances require that they\r\nshould build male cells; that they should be instructed to vary the\r\ndimensions and the shape of each piece so as to return to a regular\r\norder; and that, after having constructed thirty or forty ranges of\r\nmale cells, they again leave the regular order on which these were\r\nformed, and arrive by successive diminutions at the point from which\r\nthey set out. How should these insects be able to extricate themselves\r\nfrom such a difficulty--from such a complicated structure? how pass\r\nfrom the little to the great, from a regular plan to an irregular one,\r\nand again resume the former? These are questions which no known system\r\ncan explain[784].\r\n\r\nHere again, as observed in a former instance, the wonder would be\r\nless, if _every_ comb contained a _certain_ number of transition\r\nand of male cells, constantly situated in _one_ and the _same_ part\r\nof it: but this is far from being the case. The event which alone,\r\nat whatever period it may happen, seems to determine the bees to\r\nconstruct male cells, is the oviposition of the queen. So long as\r\nshe continues to lay the eggs of workers not a male cell is founded;\r\nbut as soon as she is about to lay male eggs, the workers seem aware\r\nof it, and you then see them form their cells irregularly, impart to\r\nthem by degrees a greater diameter, and at length prepare suitable\r\nranges of cradles for all the male race[785].--You must perceive how\r\nabsurd it would be to refer this astonishing variation of instinct\r\nto any mere change in the _sensations_ of the bees; and to what\r\nfar-fetched and gratuitous suppositions we must be reduced, if we\r\nadopt any such explanation. We can but refer it to an instinct of\r\nwhich we know nothing; and so referring it, can we help exclaiming\r\nwith Huber, \"Such is the grandeur of the views and of the means of\r\nordaining wisdom, that it is not by a minute exactness that she\r\nmarches to her end, but proceeds from irregularity to irregularity,\r\ncompensating one by another: the admeasurements are made on high,\r\nthe apparent errors appreciated by a divine geometry; and order\r\noften results from partial diversity. This is not the first instance\r\nwhich science has presented to us of preordained irregularities\r\nwhich astonish our ignorance, and are the admiration of the most\r\nenlightened minds: So true it is, that the more we investigate the\r\ngeneral as well as particular laws of this vast system, the more\r\nperfection does it present[786].\"\r\n\r\nIt is observed by M. P. Huber, in his appendix to the account of\r\nhis father's discoveries relative to the architecture of bees, that\r\nin general the form of the prisms or tubes of the cells is more\r\nessential than that of their bottoms, since the tetrahedral-bottomed\r\ntransition cells, and even those cells which being built immediately\r\nupon wood or glass, were entirely without bottoms, still preserved\r\ntheir usual shape of hexagonal prisms. But a remarkable experiment\r\nof the elder Huber shows that bees can alter even the form of their\r\ncells when circumstances require it, and that in a way which one\r\nwould not have expected.\r\n\r\nHaving placed in front of a comb which the bees were constructing,\r\na slip of glass, they seemed immediately aware that it would be\r\nvery difficult to attach it to so slippery a surface: and instead\r\nof continuing the comb in a straight line, they _bent it at a right\r\nangle_, so as to extend beyond the slip of glass, and ultimately fixed\r\nit to an adjoining part of the wood-work of the hive which the glass\r\ndid not cover. This deviation, if the comb had been a mere simple and\r\nuniform mass of wax, would have evinced no small ingenuity; but you\r\nwill bear in mind that a comb consists on each side, or face, of cells\r\nhaving between them bottoms in common: and if you take a comb, and\r\nhaving softened the wax by heat, endeavour to bend it in any part at\r\na right angle, you will then comprehend the difficulties which our\r\nlittle architects had to encounter. The resources of their instinct,\r\nhowever, were adequate to the emergency. They made the cells on the\r\n_convex_ side of the bent part of the comb much _larger_, and those on\r\nthe _concave_ side much _smaller_ than usual; the former having three\r\nor four times the diameter of the latter. But this was not all. As the\r\nbottoms of the small and large cells were as usual common to both, the\r\ncells were not regular prisms, but the small ones considerably wider\r\nat the bottom than at the top, and conversely in the large ones!--What\r\nconception can we form of so wonderful a flexibility of instinct? How,\r\nas Huber asks, can we comprehend the mode in which such a crowd of\r\nlabourers, occupied at the same time on the edge of the comb, could\r\nagree to give to it the same curvature from one extremity to the\r\nother; or how they could arrange together to construct on one face\r\ncells so small, while on the other they imparted to them such enlarged\r\ndimensions?--And how can we feel adequate astonishment that they should\r\nhave the art of making cells of such different sizes correspond[787]?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter this long but I flatter myself not wholly uninteresting\r\nenumeration, you will scarcely hesitate to admit that insects,\r\nand of these the bee pre-eminently, are endowed with a much more\r\nexquisite and flexible instinct than the larger animals. But you may\r\nbe here led to ask, Can all this be referred to instinct? Is not this\r\npliability to circumstances--this surprising adaptation of means for\r\naccomplishing an end--rather the result of _reason_?\r\n\r\nYou will not doubt my allowing the appositeness of this question,\r\nwhen I frankly tell you, that so strikingly do many of the preceding\r\nfacts seem at first view the effect of reason, that in my original\r\nsketch of the letter you are now reading, I had arranged them as\r\ninstances of this faculty. But mature consideration has convinced me\r\n(though I confess the subject has great difficulties) that this view\r\nwas fallacious; and that though some circumstances connected with\r\nthese facts may, as I shall hereafter show, be referable to reason,\r\nthe facts themselves can only be consistently explained by regarding\r\nthem as I have here done, as examples of variations of particular\r\ninstincts:--and this on two accounts.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, these variations, however singular, are _limited_\r\nin their extent: all bees are, and have always been, able to avail\r\nthemselves of a certain number, but not to increase that number. Bees\r\ncemented their combs when becoming heavy, to the top of the hive,\r\nwith mitys, in the time of Aristotle and Pliny as they do now; and\r\nthere is every reason to believe that then, as now, they occasionally\r\nvaried their procedures, by securing them with wax or with propolis\r\nonly, either added to the upper range of cells, or disposed in braces\r\nand ties to the adjoining combs. But if in thus proceeding they were\r\nguided by reason, why not under certain circumstances adopt _other_\r\nmodes of strengthening their combs? Why not, when wax and propolis\r\nare scarce, employ _mud_, which they might see the martin avail\r\nherself of so successfully? Or why should it not come into the head\r\nof some hoary denizen of the hive, that a little of the _mortar_ with\r\nwhich his careful master plasters the crevices between his habitation\r\nand its stand, might answer the end of mitys? \"Si seulement ils\r\nélevoient une fois des câbanes quarrées,\" (says Bonnet when, speaking\r\nas to what faculty the works of the beaver are to be referred,) \"mais\r\nce sont éternellement des câbanes rondes ou ovales[788]:\"--and so we\r\nmight say of the phenomena in question:--Show us but _one_ instance\r\nof bees having substituted mud or mortar for mitys, pissoceros, or\r\npropolis, or wooden props for waxen ties, and there could be no doubt\r\nof their being here guided by reason. But since no such instance is\r\non record; since they are still confined to the same limits--however\r\nsurprising the range of these limits--as they were two thousand years\r\nago; and since the bees emerged from their pupæ but a few hours\r\nbefore, will set themselves as adroitly to work and pursue their\r\noperations as scientifically as their brethren, who can boast the\r\nexperience of a long life of twelve months duration;--we must still\r\nregard these actions as variations of instinct.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, no degree of reason that we can with any share of\r\nprobability attribute to bees, could be competent to the performance\r\nof labours so complicated as those we have been considering, and\r\nwhich if the result of reason, would involve the most extensive and\r\nvaried knowledge in the agents. Suppose a man to have attained by\r\nlong practice the art of modelling wax into a congeries of uniform\r\nhexagonal cells, with pyramidal bottoms composed each of three rhombs,\r\nresembling the cells of workers among bees. Let him now be set to make\r\na congeries of similar but larger cells (answering to the male cells),\r\nand unite these with the former by other hexagonal cells, so that\r\nthere should be no disruption in the continuity or regularity of the\r\nwhole assemblage, and no vacant intervals or patching at the junctions\r\neither of the tubes or the bottoms of the cells;--and you would have\r\nset him no very easy task--a task, in short, which it may be doubted\r\nif he would satisfactorily perform in a twelvemonth, though gifted\r\nwith a clear head and a competent store of geometrical knowledge, and\r\nwhich, if destitute of these requisites, it may be safely asserted that\r\nhe would never perform at all. How then can we imagine it possible\r\nthat this difficult problem, and others of a similar kind, can be so\r\ncompletely and exactly solved by animals of which some are not two days\r\nold, others not a week, and probably none a year? The conclusion is\r\nirresistible--it is not _reason_ but _instinct_ that is their guide.\r\n\r\nThe second head under which I proposed contrasting the instincts of\r\ninsects with those of the larger animals, was that of their _number_\r\nin the same individual.--In the latter this is for the most part\r\nvery limited, not exceeding (if we omit those common to almost all\r\nanimated beings) eight or ten distinct instincts. Thus in the common\r\nduck, one instinct leads it at its birth from the egg to rush to\r\nthe water; another to seek its proper food; a third to pair with\r\nits mate; a fourth to form a nest; a fifth to sit upon its eggs\r\ntill hatched; a sixth to assist the young ducklings in extricating\r\nthemselves from the shell; and a seventh to defend them when in\r\ndanger until able to provide for themselves: and it would not be\r\neasy, as far as my knowledge extends, to add many more distinct\r\ninstinctive actions to the enumeration, or to adduce many species of\r\nthe superior classes of animals, endowed with a greater number.\r\n\r\nBut how vastly more manifold are the instincts of the majority of\r\ninsects! It is not necessary to insist upon those differences which\r\ntake place in the same insect in its different states, leading it\r\nto select one kind of food in the larva, and another in the perfect\r\nstate; to defend itself in one mode in the former, and in another in\r\nthe latter, &c.--because, however remarkable these variations, they\r\nmay be referred with great plausibility to those striking changes in\r\nthe organic structure of the animal, which occur at the two periods\r\nof its existence. It is to the number of instincts observable in the\r\nsame individual of many insects in their perfect state that I now\r\nconfine myself; and as the most striking example of the whole I shall\r\nselect the hive-bee,--begging you to bear in mind that I do not mean\r\nto include those exhibited by the queen, the drones, or even those\r\nof the workers, termed by Huber _cirières_ (wax makers); but only\r\nto enumerate those presented by that portion of the workers, termed\r\nby Huber _nourrices_ or _petites abeilles_ (nurses), upon whom, as\r\nyou have been before told[789], with the exception of making wax,\r\nlaying the foundation of the cells, and collecting honey for being\r\nstored, the principal labours of the hive devolve. It will be these\r\nindividuals alone that I shall understand by the term _bees_, under\r\nthe present head: and though the other inhabitants of the hive may\r\noccasionally concur in some of their actions and labours, yet it is\r\nobvious that so many as are those in which _they_ distinctly take\r\npart, so many instincts must we regard them as endowed with.\r\n\r\nTo begin, then, with the formation of the colony:--By one instinct\r\nbees are directed to send out scouts previously to their swarming,\r\nin search of a suitable abode[790]; and by another, to rush out of\r\nthe hive after the queen that leads forth the swarm, and follow\r\nwherever she bends her course. Having taken possession of their new\r\nabode, whether of their own selection or prepared for them by the\r\nhand of man, a third instinct teaches them to cleanse it from all\r\nimpurities[791]; a fourth to collect propolis, and with it to stop\r\nup every crevice except the entrance; a fifth to ventilate the hive\r\nfor preserving the purity of the air; and a sixth to keep a constant\r\nguard at the door[792].\r\n\r\nIn constructing the houses and streets of their new city, or the cells\r\nand combs, there are probably several distinct instincts exercised;\r\nbut not to leave room for objection, I shall regard them as the result\r\nof one only: yet the operations of polishing the interior of the\r\ncells, and soldering their angles and orifices with propolis, which\r\nare sometimes not undertaken for weeks after the cells are built[793];\r\nand the obscure but still more curious one of varnishing them with\r\nthe yellow tinge observable in old combs;--seem clearly referable to\r\nat least two distinct instincts. The varnishing process is so little\r\nconnected with that of building, that, though it takes place in\r\nsome combs in three or four days, it does not in others for several\r\nmonths, though both are equally employed for the same uses[794]. Huber\r\nascertained by accurate experiment that this tinge is not owing to the\r\nheat of the hives; to any vapours in the air which they include; to any\r\nemanations from the wax or honey; nor to the deposition of this last\r\nin the cells; but he inclines to think it is occasioned by a yellow\r\nmatter which the bees seem to detach from their mandibles, and to apply\r\nto the surface which they are varnishing, by repeated strokes of these\r\norgans and of the fore feet[795].\r\n\r\nIn their out-of-door operations several distinct instincts are\r\nconcerned. By one they are led to extract honey from the nectaries\r\nof flowers; by another to collect pollen after a process involving\r\nvery complicated manipulations, and requiring a singular apparatus of\r\nbrushes and baskets; and that must surely be considered a third, which\r\nso remarkably and beneficially restricts each gathering to the same\r\nplant[796]. It is clearly a distinct instinct which inspires bees with\r\nsuch dread of rain, that even if a cloud pass before the sun, they\r\nreturn to the hive in the greatest haste[797]; and that seems to me\r\nnot less so, which teaches them to find their way back to their home\r\nafter the most distant and intricate wanderings. When bees have found\r\nthe direction in which their hive lies, Huber says they fly to it with\r\nan extreme rapidity, and as straight as a ball from a musket[798]:\r\nand if their hives were always in open situations, one might suppose,\r\nas Huber seems inclined to think, that it is by their sight they are\r\nconducted to them. But hives are frequently found in small gardens\r\nembowered in wood; and in the midst of villages surrounded and\r\ninterspersed with trees and buildings, so as to make it impossible\r\nthat they can be seen from a distance. If you had been with me in\r\n1815, in the famous Pays de Waes in Flanders--where the country is a\r\nperfect flat, and the inhabitants so enamoured either of the beauty\r\nor profit of trees, that their fields, which are rarely above three\r\nacres in extent, are _constantly_ surrounded with a double row, making\r\nthe whole district one vast wood--you would have pitied the poor bees\r\nif reduced to depend on their own eye-sight for retracing the road\r\nhomeward. In vain during my stay at St. Nicholas I sallied out at every\r\noutlet to try to gain some idea of the extent and form of the town.\r\nTrees--trees--trees--still met me, and intercepted the view in every\r\ndirection; and I defy any inhabitant bee of this rural metropolis,\r\nafter once quitting its hive, ever to gain a glimpse of it again until\r\nnearly perpendicularly over it. The bees, therefore, of the Pays de\r\nWaes, and consequently all other bees, must be led to their abodes by\r\ninstinct, as certainly as it is instinct that directs the migrations of\r\nbirds or of fishes, or domestic quadrupeds to find out their homes from\r\ninconceivable distances[799].--When they have reached the hive, another\r\ninstinct leads them to regurgitate into the extended proboscis of their\r\nhungry companions who have been occupied at home, a portion of the\r\nhoney collected in the fields; and another directs them to unload their\r\nlegs of the masses of pollen, and to store it in the cells for future\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nSeveral distinct instincts, again, are called into action in the\r\nimportant business of feeding the young brood. One teaches them to\r\nswallow pollen, not to satisfy the calls of hunger, but that it may\r\nundergo in their stomach an elaboration fitting it for the food of\r\nthe grubs; and another to regurgitate it when duly concocted, and to\r\nadminister it to their charge, proportioning the supply to the age\r\nand condition of the recipients. A third informs them when the young\r\ngrubs have attained their full growth, and directs them to cover\r\ntheir cells with a waxen lid, convex in the male cells, but nearly\r\nflat in those of workers; and by a fourth, as soon as the young bees\r\nhave burst into day, they are impelled to clean out the deserted\r\ntenements and to make them ready for new occupants.\r\n\r\nNumerous as are the instincts I have already enumerated, the list must\r\nyet include those connected with that mysterious principle which binds\r\nthe working bees of a hive to their queen:--the singular imprisonment\r\nin which they retain the young queens that are to lead off a swarm,\r\nuntil their wings be sufficiently expanded to enable them to fly the\r\nmoment they are at liberty, gradually paring away the waxen wall that\r\nconfines them to their cell to an extreme thinness, and only suffering\r\nit to be broken down at the precise moment required;--the attention\r\nwith which, in these circumstances, they feed the imprisoned queen by\r\nfrequently putting honey upon her proboscis, protruded from a small\r\norifice in the lid of her cell;--the watchfulness with which, when at\r\nthe period of swarming more queens than one are required, they place a\r\nguard over the cells of those undisclosed, to preserve them from the\r\njealous fury of their excluded rivals;--the exquisite calculation with\r\nwhich they invariably release the _oldest_ queens the first from their\r\nconfinement;--the singular love of monarchical dominion, by which, when\r\ntwo queens in other circumstances are produced, they are led to impel\r\nthem to combat until one is destroyed;--the ardent devotion which binds\r\nthem to the fate and fortunes of the survivor;--the distraction which\r\nthey manifest at her loss, and their resolute determination not to\r\naccept of any stranger until an interval has elapsed sufficiently long\r\nto allow of no chance of the return of their rightful sovereign;--and\r\n(to omit a further enumeration) the obedience which in the utmost noise\r\nand confusion they show to her well-known hum.\r\n\r\nI have now instanced at least thirty distinct instincts with which\r\nevery individual of the nurses amongst the working-bees is endowed:\r\nand if to the account be added their care to carry from the hive\r\nthe dead bodies of any of the community; their pertinacity in their\r\nbattles, in directing their sting at those parts only of the bodies\r\nof their adversaries which are penetrable by it; their annual\r\nautumnal murder of the drones, &c. &c.--it is certain that this\r\nnumber might be very considerably increased, perhaps doubled.\r\n\r\nAt the first view you will be inclined to suspect some fallacy in\r\nthis enumeration, and that this variety of actions ought to be\r\nreferred rather to some general principle, capable of accommodating\r\nitself to different circumstances, than to so many different kinds of\r\ninstinct. But to what principle? Not to reason, the faculty to which\r\nwe assign this power of varying accommodation. All the actions above\r\nadduced come strictly under the description of instinctive actions,\r\nbeing all performed by every generation of bees since the creation of\r\nthe world, and as perfectly a day or two after their birth as at any\r\nsubsequent period. And as the very essence of instinct consists in\r\nthe determinate character of the actions to which it gives birth, it\r\nis clear that every distinctly different action must be referred to a\r\ndistinct instinct. Few will dispute that the instinct which leads a\r\nduck to resort to the water is a different instinct from that which\r\nleads her to sit upon her eggs; for the hen though endowed with one\r\nis not with the other. In fact, they are as distinct and unconnected\r\nas the senses of sight and smell; and it appears to me that it would\r\nbe as contrary to philosophical accuracy of language, in the former\r\ncase to call the two instincts modifications of each other, as in the\r\nlatter so to designate the two senses; and as we say that a deaf and\r\nblind man has fewer senses than other men, so (strictly) we ought not\r\nto speak of instinct as one faculty (though to avoid circumlocution\r\nI have myself often employed this common mode of expression), or\r\nsay that one insect has a greater or less share of instinct than\r\nanother, but more or fewer _instincts_.--That it is not always easy\r\nto determine what actions are to be referred to a distinct instinct\r\nand what to a modification of an instinct, I am very ready to\r\nadmit; but this is no solid ground for regarding all instincts as\r\nmodifications of some one principle. It is often equally difficult to\r\nfix the limits between instinct and reason; but we are not on this\r\naccount justified in deeming them the same.\r\n\r\nThis multitude of instincts in the same individual, becomes more\r\nwonderful when considered in another point of view. Were they\r\nconstantly to follow each other in regular sequence, so that each\r\nbee necessarily first began to build cells, then to collect honey,\r\nnext pollen, and so on, we might plausibly enough refer them to some\r\nchange in the sensations of the animal, caused by alterations in the\r\nstructure and gradual development of its organs, in the same way as\r\non similar principles we explain the sexual instincts of the superior\r\ntribes. But it is certain that no such consecutive series prevails.\r\nThe different instincts of the bee are called into action in an order\r\nregulated solely by the needs of the society. If combs be wanted,\r\nno bee collects honey for storing until they are provided[800]: and\r\nif, when constructed, any accident injure or destroy them, every\r\nlabour is suspended until the mischief is repaired or new ones\r\nsubstituted[801]. When the crevices round the hive are effectually\r\nsecured with propolis, the instinct directing the collection of this\r\nsubstance lies dormant: but transfer the bees to a new hive which\r\nshall require a new luting, and it is instantly re-excited. But these\r\ninstances are superfluous. Every one knows that at the same moment\r\nof time the citizens of a hive are employed in the most varied and\r\nopposite operations. Some are collecting pollen; others are in search\r\nof honey; some busied at home in the first construction of the cells;\r\nothers in giving them their last polish; others in ventilating the\r\nhive; others again in feeding the young brood and the like.\r\n\r\nNow, how are we to account for this regularity of procedure--this\r\nundeviating accuracy with which the precise instinct wanted is\r\nexcited--this total absence of all confusion in the employment by\r\neach inhabitant of the hive, of that particular instinct out of so\r\nmany which the good of the community requires? No thinking man ever\r\nwitnesses the complexness and yet regularity and efficiency of a\r\ngreat establishment, such as the Bank of England, or the Post-office,\r\nwithout marvelling that even human reason can put together with so\r\nlittle friction and such slight deviations from correctness, machines\r\nwhose wheels are composed not of wood and iron, but of fickle mortals\r\nof a thousand different inclinations, powers, and capacities. But if\r\nsuch establishments be surprising even with reason for their prime\r\nmover, how much more so is a hive of bees whose proceedings are\r\nguided by their instincts alone! We can conceive that the sensations\r\nof hunger experienced on awaking in the morning should excite into\r\naction their instinct of gathering honey. But all are hungry: yet all\r\ndo not rush out in search of flowers. What _sensation_ is it that\r\n_detains_ a portion of the hive at home, unmindful of the gnawings\r\nof an empty stomach, busied in domestic arrangements, until the\r\nreturn of their roving companions? Of those that fly abroad, what\r\nconception can we form of the cause which, while one set is gathering\r\nhoney or pollen, leads another company to load their legs with\r\npellets of propolis? Are we to say that the instinct of the former\r\nis excited by one sensation, that of the latter by another? But why\r\nshould one sensation predominate in one set of bees, while another\r\ntakes the lead in a second?--or how is it that these different\r\ninstincts are called up precisely in the degree which the actual\r\nand changing state of things in the hive requires?--Of those which\r\nremain at home, what is it that determines in one party the instinct\r\nof building cells to prevail; in another that of ventilating the\r\nhive; in a third that of feeding the young brood? For my own part,\r\nI confess that the more I reflect on this subject, and contrast the\r\ndiversity of the means with the regularity and uniformity of the\r\nend, the more I am lost in astonishment. The effects of instinct\r\nseem even more wonderful than those of reason, in the same manner\r\nas the consentaneous movements of a mighty and divided army, which,\r\nthough under the command of twenty generals and from the most distant\r\nquarters, should meet at the assigned spot at the very hour fixed\r\nupon, would be more surprising than the steam-moved operations,\r\nhowever complex, of one of Boulton's mints.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of distinctness and compression, I have confined myself\r\nin considering the number of the instincts of individual insects to\r\na single species, the bee; but if the history of other societies\r\nof these animals--wasps, ants, &c. detailed in my former letters,\r\nbe duly weighed, it will be seen that they furnish examples of the\r\nvariety in question fully as striking. These corroborating proofs I\r\nshall leave to your own inference, and proceed to the third head,\r\nunder which I proposed to consider the instincts of insects--that of\r\ntheir extraordinary development.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe development of some of the instincts of the larger animals, such as\r\nthose of sex, is well known to depend upon their age and the peculiar\r\nstate of the bodily organs; and to this, as before observed, the\r\nsuccession of different instincts in the same insect, in its larva and\r\nperfect state, is closely analogous. But what I have now in view is\r\nthat _extraordinary development_ of instinct, which is dependent not\r\nupon the age or any change in the organization of the animal, but upon\r\nexternal events--which in individuals of the _same_ species, age, and\r\nstructure, in some circumstances slumbers unmoved, but may in others be\r\nexcited to the most singular and unlooked-for action. In illustrating\r\nthis property of instinct, which, as far as I am aware, is not known to\r\noccur in any of the larger animals, I shall confine myself as before to\r\nthe hive-bee; the only insect, indeed, in which its existence has been\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained, though it is highly probable that other\r\nspecies living in societies may exhibit the same phenomenon.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the facts occurring in the history of bees might be\r\nreferred to this head; but I shall here advert only to the treatment\r\nof the drones by the workers under different circumstances, and to\r\nthe operations of the latter consequent upon the irretrievable loss\r\nof the queen--facts which have been before stated to you, but to the\r\nprincipal features of which my present argument makes it necessary\r\nthat I should again direct your attention.\r\n\r\nIf a hive of bees be this year in possession of a queen duly\r\nfertilized, and consequently sure the next season of a succession\r\nof males, all the drones, as I have before stated[802], towards\r\nthe approach of winter are massacred by the workers with the most\r\nunrelenting ferocity. To this seemingly cruel course they are\r\ndoubtless impelled by an imperious instinct; and as it is regularly\r\nfollowed in every hive thus circumstanced, it would seem at the first\r\nview to be an impulse as intimately connected with the organization\r\nand very existence of the workers, and as incapable of change, as\r\nthat which leads them to build cells or to store up honey. But this\r\nis far from being the case. However certain the doom of the drones\r\nthis autumn, if the hive be furnished with a duly-fertilized queen,\r\ntheir undisturbed existence over the winter is equally sure if the\r\nhive have lost its sovereign, or her impregnation have been so\r\nretarded as to make a succession of males in the spring doubtful. In\r\nsuch a hive the workers do not destroy a single drone, though the\r\nhottest persecution rages in all the hives around them.\r\n\r\nNow, how are we to explain this difference of conduct? Are we to\r\nsuppose that the bees know and reason upon this alteration in the\r\ncircumstances of their community--that they infer the possibility\r\nof their entire extinction if the whole male stock were destroyed\r\nwhen without a queen--and that thus influenced by a wise policy they\r\nrestrain the fury they would otherwise have exercised? This would be\r\nat once to make them not only gifted with reason, but endowed with a\r\npower of looking before and after, and a command over the strongest\r\nnatural propensities, superior to what could be expected in a similar\r\ncase even from a society of men; and is obviously unwarrantable. The\r\nonly probable supposition is, clearly, that a new instinct is developed\r\nsuited to the extraordinary situation in which the community stands,\r\nleading them now to regard with kindness the drones, for whom otherwise\r\nthey would have felt the most violent aversion.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, indeed, it would perhaps be more strictly correct\r\nto say (which, however, is equally wonderful) that the old instinct\r\nwas extinguished; but in the case of the loss of a queen, to which\r\nI am next to advert, which is followed by positive operations,\r\nthe extraordinary development of a new and peculiar instinct is\r\nindisputable.\r\n\r\nIn a hive which no untoward event has deprived of its queen,\r\nthe workers take no other active steps in the education of her\r\nsuccessors--those of which one is to occupy her place when she has\r\nflown off at the head of a new swarm in spring--than to prepare a\r\ncertain number of cells of extraordinary capacity for their reception\r\nwhile in the egg, and to feed them when become grubs with a peculiar\r\nfood until they have attained maturity. This, therefore, is their\r\nordinary instinct; and it may happen that the workers of a hive may\r\nhave no necessity for a long series of successive generations to\r\nexercise any other. But suppose them to lose their queen. Far from\r\nsinking into that inactive despair which was formerly attributed to\r\nthem, after the commotion which the rapidly-circulated news of their\r\ncalamity gave birth to has subsided, they betake themselves with an\r\nalacrity from which man when under misfortune might deign to take\r\na lesson, to the active reparation of their loss. Several ordinary\r\ncells, as was before related at large[803], are without delay pulled\r\ndown, and converted into a variable number of royal cells capacious\r\nenough for the education of one or more queen-grubs selected out of\r\nthe unhoused working grubs--which in this pressing emergency are\r\nmercilessly sacrificed--and fed with the appropriate royal food to\r\nmaturity. Thus sure of once more acquiring a head, the hive return to\r\ntheir ordinary labours, and in about sixteen days one or more queens\r\nare produced; one of which, after being indebted to fortune for an\r\nelevation as singular as that of Catherine the First of Russia, steps\r\ninto day and assumes the reins of state.\r\n\r\nTo this remarkable deviation from the usual procedures of the\r\ncommunity, the observations above made in the case of the drones\r\nmust be applied. We cannot account for it by conceiving the working\r\nbees to be acquainted with the end which their operations have in\r\nview. If we suppose them to _know_ that the queen and working-grubs\r\nare originally the same, and that to convert one of the latter into\r\nthe former it is only necessary to transfer it to an apartment\r\nsufficiently spacious and to feed it with a peculiar food, we confer\r\nupon them a depth of reason to which Prometheus, when he made his\r\nclay man, had no pretensions--an original discovery, in short, to\r\nwhich man has but just attained after some thousand years of painful\r\nresearch, having escaped all the observers of bees from Aristomachus,\r\nto Swammerdam and Reaumur of modern times. We have no other\r\nalternative, then, but to refer this phenomenon to the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of a new instinct suited for the exigency, however\r\nincomprehensible to us the manner of its excitement may appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Such, then, are the exquisiteness, the number, and the\r\nextraordinary development of the instincts of insects. But is instinct\r\nthe _sole_ guide of their actions? Are they in every case the blind\r\nagents of irresistible impulse? These queries, I have already hinted,\r\ncannot in my opinion be replied to in the affirmative; and I now\r\nproceed to show, that though instinct is the chief guide of insects,\r\nthey are endowed also with no inconsiderable portion of _reason_.\r\n\r\nSome share of reason is denied by few philosophers of the present day\r\nto the larger animals. But its existence has not generally (except\r\nby those who reject instinct altogether) been recognised in insects:\r\nprobably on the ground that, as the proportions of reason and of\r\ninstinct seem to co-exist in an inverse ratio, the former might be\r\nexpected to be extinct in a class in which the latter is found in\r\nsuch perfection. This rule, however, though it may hold good in man,\r\nwhose instincts are so few and imperfect, and whose reason is so\r\npre-eminent, is far from being confirmed by an extended survey of the\r\nclasses of animals generally. Many quadrupeds, birds, and fishes,\r\nwith instincts apparently not very acute, do not seem to have their\r\nplace supplied by a proportionably superior share of reason: and\r\ninsects, as I think the facts I have to adduce will prove, though\r\nranking so low in the scale of creation, seem to enjoy as great a\r\ndegree of reason as many animals of the superior classes, yet in\r\ncombination with instincts much more numerous and exquisite.\r\n\r\nI must premise, however, that in so perplexed and intricate a field, I\r\nam sensible how necessary it is to tread with caution. A far greater\r\ncollection of facts must be made, and the science of metaphysics\r\ngenerally be placed on a more solid foundation than it now can boast,\r\nbefore we can pretend to decide, in numerous cases, which of the\r\nactions of insects are to be deemed purely instinctive, and which the\r\nresult of reason. What I advance, therefore, on this head, I wish to\r\nbe regarded rather as conjectures, that, after the best consideration\r\nI am able to give to a subject so much beyond my depth, seem to me\r\nplausible, than as certainties to which I require your implicit assent.\r\n\r\nThat reason has nothing to do with the major part of the actions of\r\ninsects is clear, as I have before observed, from the determinateness\r\nand perfection of these actions, and from their being performed\r\nindependently of instruction and experience. A young bee (I must once\r\nmore repeat) betakes itself to the complex operation of building\r\ncells, with as much skill as the oldest of its compatriots. We cannot\r\nsuppose that it has any _knowledge_ of the purposes for which the\r\ncells are destined; or of the effects that will result from its\r\nfeeding the young larvæ, and the like. And if an individual bee be\r\nthus destitute of the very materials of reasoning as to its main\r\noperations, so must the society in general.\r\n\r\nNor in those remarkable deviations and accommodations to circumstances,\r\ninstanced under a former head, can we, for considerations there\r\nassigned, suppose insects to be influenced by reason. These deviations\r\nare still limited in number, and involve acts far too complex and\r\nrecondite to spring from any process of ratiocination in an animal\r\nwhose term of life does not exceed two years.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that reason may not have a part in\r\ninducing some of these last-mentioned actions, though the actions\r\nthemselves are purely instinctive. I do not pretend to explain in\r\nwhat way or degree they are combined; but certainly some of the facts\r\ndo not seem to admit of explanation, except on this supposition.\r\nThus, in the instance above cited from Huber, in which the bees\r\nbent a comb at right angles in order to avoid a slip of glass, the\r\nremarkable variations in the form of the cells can only, as I have\r\nthere said, be referred to instinct. Yet the original determination\r\nto avoid the glass seems, as Huber himself observes, to indicate\r\nsomething more than instinct, since glass is not a substance\r\nagainst which Nature can be supposed to have forewarned bees, there\r\nbeing nothing in hollow trees (their natural abodes) resembling it\r\neither in polish or substance: and what was most striking in their\r\noperations was, that they did not wait until they had reached the\r\nsurface of the glass before changing the direction of the comb,\r\nbut adopted this variation at a considerable distance, as though\r\nthey foresaw the inconveniences which might result from another\r\nmode of construction[804].--However difficult it may be to form a\r\nclear conception of this union of instinct and reason in the same\r\noperation, or to define precisely the limits of each, instances of\r\nthese _mixed_ actions are sufficiently common among animals to leave\r\nlittle doubt of the fact. It is instinct which leads a greyhound to\r\npursue a hare; but it must be reason that directs \"an _old_ greyhound\r\nto trust the more fatiguing part of the chase to the younger, and to\r\nplace himself so as to meet the hare in her doubles[805].\"\r\n\r\nAs another instance of these mixed actions in which both reason\r\nand instinct seem concerned, but the former more decidedly, may be\r\ncited the account which Huber gives of the manner in which the bees\r\nof some of his neighbours protected themselves against the attacks\r\nof the death's-head-moth (_Acherontia Atropos_), laid before you in\r\na former letter[806], by so closing the entrance of the hive with\r\nwalls, arcades, casements, and bastions, built of a mixture of wax\r\nand propolis, that these insidious marauders could no longer intrude\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely attribute these elaborate fortifications to reason\r\nsimply; for it appears that bees have recourse to a similar defensive\r\nexpedient when attacked even by other bees; and the means employed\r\nseem too subtle and too well adapted to the end to be the result of\r\nthis faculty in a bee.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, if it be most probable that in this instance\r\ninstinct was chiefly concerned, if we impartially consider the\r\nfacts, it seems impossible to deny that reason had some share in\r\nthe operations. Pure instinct would have taught the bees to fortify\r\nthemselves on the _first_ attack. If the occupants of a hive had been\r\ntaken unawares by these gigantic aggressors one night, on the second,\r\nat least, the entrance should have been barricadoed. But it appears\r\nclear from the statement of Huber, that it was not until the hives\r\nhad been repeatedly attacked and robbed of nearly their whole stock\r\nof honey, that the bees betook themselves to the plan so successfully\r\nadopted for the security of their remaining treasures; so that\r\nreason taught by experience, seems to have called into action their\r\ndormant instinct[807].\r\n\r\nIf it be thus probable that reason has some influence upon the\r\nactions of insects, which must be mainly regarded as instinctive, the\r\nexistence of this faculty is still more evident in numerous traits\r\nof their history where instinct is little if at all concerned. An\r\ninsect is taught by its instincts the most unerring means to the\r\nattainment of certain ends; but these ends, as I have already had\r\noccasion more than once to remark, are limited in number, and such\r\nonly as are called for by its wants in a state of nature. We cannot\r\nreasonably suppose insects to be gifted with instincts adapted for\r\noccasions that are never likely to happen. If therefore we find them,\r\nin these extraordinary and improbable emergencies, still availing\r\nthemselves of the means apparently best calculated for ensuring their\r\nobject;--and if in addition they seem in some cases to gain knowledge\r\nby experience; if they can communicate information to each other; and\r\nif they are endowed with memory;--it appears impossible to deny that\r\nthey are possessed of reason.--I shall now produce facts in proof of\r\neach of these positions; not by any means all that might be adduced,\r\nbut a few of the most striking that occur to me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFirst, then, insects often in cases not likely to be provided for by\r\ninstinct, adopt means evidently designed for effecting their object.\r\n\r\nA certain degree of warmth is necessary to hatch a hen's eggs, and\r\nwe give her little credit for reason in sitting upon them for this\r\npurpose. But if any one had ever seen a hen make her nest in a heap\r\nof fermenting dung, among the bark of a hot-bed, or in the vicinity\r\nof a baker's oven, where, the heat being as well adapted as the\r\nstoves of the Egyptians to bring her chickens into life, she left off\r\nthe habit of her race, and saved herself the trouble of sitting upon\r\nthem,--we should certainly pronounce her a _reasoning_ hen: and if\r\nthis hen had chanced to be that very one figured and so elaborately\r\ndescribed by Professor Fischer, with _the profile of an old\r\nwoman_[808], a Hindoo metaphysician at least could not doubt of her\r\nbody, however hen-like, being in truth directed in its operations by\r\nthe soul of some quondam amateur of poultry-breeding. Now societies\r\nof ants have more than once exhibited a deviation from their usual\r\ninstinct, which to me seems quite as extraordinary and as indicative\r\nof reason as would be that supposed in a hen. A certain degree of\r\nwarmth is required for the exclusion and rearing of their eggs, larvæ\r\nand pupæ; and in their ordinary abodes, as you have been already\r\ntold[809], they undergo great daily labour in removing their charge\r\nto different parts of the nest, as its temperature is affected by the\r\npresence or absence of the sun. But Reaumur, in refuting the common\r\nnotion of ants being injurious to bees, tells us that societies of\r\nthe former often saved themselves all this trouble, by establishing\r\ntheir colonies between the exterior wooden shutters and panes of his\r\nglass hives, where, owing to the latter substance being a tolerably\r\ngood conductor of heat, their progeny was at _all times_, and\r\nwithout any necessity of changing their situation, in a constant,\r\nequable, and sufficient temperature[810]. Bonnet observed the same\r\nfact. He found that a society of ants had piled up their young to the\r\nheight of several inches, between the flannel-lined case of his glass\r\nhives and the glass. When disturbed they ran away with them, but\r\nalways replaced them[811].\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that after duly considering these facts, you will\r\nagree with me that it is impossible consistently to refer them to\r\ninstinct, or to account for them without supposing some stray ant,\r\nthat had insinuated herself into this tropical crevice, first to\r\nhave been struck with the _thought_ of what a prodigious saving of\r\nlabour and anxiety would occur to her compatriots by establishing\r\ntheir society here;--that she had communicated her _ideas_ to\r\nthem;--and that they had resolved upon an emigration to this\r\nnew-discovered country--this Madeira of ants--whose genial clime\r\npresented advantages which no other situation could offer. Neither\r\ninstinct, nor any conceivable modification of instinct, could have\r\ntaught the ants to avail themselves of a good fortune which but for\r\nthe invention of glass hives would never have offered itself to a\r\ngeneration of these insects since the creation; for there is nothing\r\nanalogous in nature to the constant and equable warmth of such a\r\nsituation, the heat of any accidental mass of fermenting materials\r\nsoon ceasing, and no heat being given out from a society of bees when\r\nlodged in a hollow tree, their natural residence. The conclusion,\r\nthen, seems irresistible, that reason must have been their guide,\r\ninducing a departure from their natural instinct as extraordinary as\r\nwould be that of a hen which should lay her eggs in a hot-bed, and\r\ncease to sit upon them.\r\n\r\nThe adaptation of means to an end not likely to have been provided\r\nfor by instinct, is equally obvious in the ingenious mode by which a\r\nnest of humble-bees propped up their tottering comb, the particulars\r\nof which having before mentioned to you[812], I need not here repeat.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no surer criterion of reason than, after having tried\r\none mode of accomplishing a purpose, adopting another more likely to\r\nsucceed. Insects are able to stand this test. A bee which Huber watched\r\nwhile soldering the angles of a cell with propolis, detached a thread\r\nof this material with which she entered the cell. Instinct would have\r\ntaught her to separate it of the exact length required; but after\r\napplying it to the angle of the cell, she found it too long, and cut\r\noff a portion so as to fit it to her purpose[813].\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple instance; but one such fact is as decisive in\r\nproof of reason as a thousand more complex, and of such there is no\r\nlack. Dr. Darwin (whose authority in the present case depending not\r\non hearsay, but his own observation, may be here taken,) informs\r\nus, that walking one day in his garden he perceived a wasp upon\r\nthe gravel walk with a large fly nearly as big as itself which it\r\nhad caught. Kneeling down he distinctly saw it cut off the head\r\nand abdomen, and then taking up with its feet the trunk or middle\r\nportion of the body to which the wings remained attached, fly away.\r\nBut a breeze of wind acting upon the wings of the fly turned round\r\nthe wasp with its burthen, and impeded its progress. Upon this it\r\nalighted again on the gravel walk, deliberately sawed off first one\r\nwing and then the other; and having thus removed the cause of its\r\nembarrassment, flew off with its booty[814]. Could any process of\r\nratiocination be more perfect? \"Something acts upon the wings of this\r\nfly and impedes my flight. If I wish to reach my nest quickly, I must\r\nget rid of them--to effect which, the shortest way will be to alight\r\nagain and cut them off.\" These reflections, or others of similar\r\nimport, must be supposed to have passed through the mind of the wasp,\r\nor its actions are altogether inexplicable. Instinct might have\r\ntaught it to cut off the wings of _all_ flies, previously to flying\r\naway with them. But here it first attempted to fly with the wings\r\non,--was impeded by a certain cause,--discovered what this cause\r\nwas,--and alighted to remove it. The chain of evidence seems perfect\r\nin proof that nothing but reason could have been its prompter.\r\n\r\nAn analogous though less striking fact is mentioned by Reaumur on\r\nthe authority of M. Cossigny, who witnessed it in the Isle of France\r\nwhere the _Sphecina_ are accustomed to bury the bodies of cockroaches\r\nalong with their eggs for provision for their young. He sometimes saw\r\nan insect of this tribe attempt to drag after it into its hole a dead\r\ncockroach, which was too big to be made to enter by all its efforts.\r\nAfter several ineffectual trials the animal came out, cut off its\r\nelytra and some of its legs, and thus reduced in compass drew in its\r\nprey without difficulty[815].\r\n\r\nUnder this head I shall mention but one fact more.--A friend of\r\nGleditsch the observer of the singular economy of the burying beetle\r\n(_Necrophorus Vespillo_) related in a former letter[816], being\r\ndesirous of drying a dead toad, fixed it to the top of a piece of\r\nwood which he stuck into the ground. But a short time afterwards,\r\nhe found that a body of these indefatigable little sextons had\r\ncircumvented him in spite of his precautions. Not being able to reach\r\nthe toad, they had undermined the base of the stick until it fell,\r\nand then buried both stick and toad[817].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the second place, insects gain knowledge from _experience_, which\r\nwould be impossible if they were not gifted with some portion of\r\nreason. In proof of their thus profiting, I shall select from the\r\nnumerous facts that might be brought forward, two only, one of which\r\nhas been already slightly adverted to[818].\r\n\r\nM. P. Huber, in his valuable paper in the sixth volume of the\r\n_Linnean Transactions_[819], states that he has seen large\r\nhumble-bees, when unable from the size of their head and thorax\r\nto reach to the bottom of the long tubes of the flowers of beans,\r\ngo directly to the calyx, pierce it as well as the tube with the\r\nexterior horny parts of their proboscis, and then insert their\r\nproboscis itself into the orifice and abstract the honey. They\r\nthus flew from flower to flower, piercing the tubes from without,\r\nand sucking the nectar, while smaller humble-bees or those with a\r\nlonger proboscis entered in at the top of the corolla. Now from this\r\nstatement it seems evident, that the larger bees did not pierce the\r\nbottoms of the flowers until they had ascertained by trial that\r\nthey could not reach the nectar from the top; but that having once\r\nascertained by experience that the flowers of beans are too strait\r\nto admit them, they then, without further attempts in the ordinary\r\nway, pierced the bottoms of _all_ the flowers which they wished to\r\nrifle of their sweets.--M. Aubert du Petit-Thouars observed that\r\nhumble-bees and the carpenter-bee (_Xylocopa_[820] _violacea_) gained\r\naccess in a similar manner to the nectar of _Antirrhinum Linaria_ and\r\n_majus_, and _Mirabilis Jalappa_; as do the common bees of the Isle\r\nof France to that of _Canna indica_[821]; and I have myself more than\r\nonce noticed holes at the base of the long nectaries of _Aquilegia\r\nvulgaris_, which I attribute to the same agency.\r\n\r\nMy second fact is supplied by the same ants, whose sagacious choice\r\nof the vicinity of Reaumur's glass hives for their colony has been\r\njust related to you. He tells us that of these ants, of which\r\nthere were such swarms on the outside of the hive, not a single\r\none was ever perceived within; and infers that, as they are such\r\nlovers of honey, and there was no difficulty in finding crevices\r\nto enter in at, they were kept without, solely from fear of the\r\nconsequences[822]. Whence arose this fear? We have no ground for\r\nsupposing ants endowed with any instinctive dread of bees; and\r\nReaumur tells us, that when he happened to leave in his garden, hives\r\nof which the bees had died, the ants then never failed to enter them\r\nand regale themselves with the honey. It seems reasonable, therefore,\r\nto attribute it to experience. Some of the ants no doubt had tried to\r\nenter the peopled as they did the empty hive, but had been punished\r\nfor their presumption, and the dear-bought lesson was not lost on\r\nthe rest of the community.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInsects, in the third place, are able mutually to _communicate_ and\r\n_receive information_, which, in whatever way effected, would be\r\nimpracticable if they were devoid of reason. Under this head it is\r\nonly necessary to refer you to the endless facts in proof, furnished\r\nby almost every page of my letters on the history of ants and of\r\nthe hive-bee. I shall therefore but detain you for a moment with an\r\nadditional anecdote or two, especially with one respecting the former\r\ntribe, which is valuable from the celebrity of the relater.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin was of opinion that ants could communicate their ideas\r\nto each other; in proof of which he related to Kalm, the Swedish\r\ntraveller, the following fact. Having placed a pot containing treacle\r\nin a closet infested with ants, these insects found their way into\r\nit, and were feasting very heartily when he discovered them. He then\r\nshook them out and suspended the pot by a string from the ceiling.\r\nBy chance one ant remained, which, after eating its fill, with some\r\ndifficulty found its way up the string, and thence reaching the\r\nceiling, escaped by the wall to its nest. In less than half an hour a\r\ngreat company of ants sallied out of their hole, climbed the ceiling,\r\ncrept along the string into the pot, and began to eat again. This\r\nthey continued until the treacle was all consumed, one swarm running\r\nup the string while another passed down[823]. It seems indisputable\r\nthat the one ant had in this instance conveyed news of the booty to\r\nhis comrades, who would not otherwise have at once directed their\r\nsteps in a body to the only accessible route.\r\n\r\nA German artist, a man of strict veracity, states that in his journey\r\nthrough Italy he was an eye-witness to the following occurrence.\r\nHe observed a species of Scarabæus (_Ateuchis pilularius?_) busily\r\nengaged in making, for the reception of its egg, a pellet of dung,\r\nwhich when finished it rolled to the summit of a small hillock, and\r\nrepeatedly suffered to tumble down its side, apparently for the sake\r\nof consolidating it by the earth which each time adhered to it. During\r\nthis process the pellet unluckily fell into an adjoining hole, out of\r\nwhich all the efforts of the beetle to extricate it were in vain. After\r\nseveral ineffectual trials, the insect repaired to an adjoining heap\r\nof dung, and soon returned with three of his companions. All four now\r\napplied their united strength to the pellet, and at length succeeded in\r\npushing it out; which being done, the three assistant beetles left the\r\nspot and returned to their own quarters[824].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLastly, insects are endowed with _memory_, which (at least in\r\nconnexion with the purposes to which it is subservient) implies some\r\ndegree of reason also; and their historian may exclaim with the poet\r\nwho has so well sung the pleasures of this faculty,\r\n\r\n          Hail, MEMORY, hail! thy universal reign\r\n          Guards the least link of Being's glorious chain.\r\n\r\nIn the elegant lines in which this couplet occurs[825], which were\r\npointed out to me by my friend Dr. Alderson of Hull, Mr. Rogers\r\nsupposes the bee to be conducted to its hive by retracing the scents\r\nof the various flowers which it has visited: but this idea is more\r\npoetical than accurate, bees, as before observed[826], flying\r\nstraight to their hives from great distances. Here, as I have more\r\nthan once had occasion to remark in similar instances, we have to\r\nregret the want of more correct entomological information in the\r\npoet, who might have employed with as much effect, the real fact of\r\nbees distinguishing their own hives out of numbers near them, when\r\nconducted to the spot by instinct. This recognition of home seems\r\nclearly the result of memory; and it is remarkable that bees appear\r\nto recollect their own hive rather from its situation, than from any\r\nobservations on the hive itself[827]: just as a man is guided to his\r\nhouse from his memory of its position relative to other buildings or\r\nobjects, without its being necessary for him even to cast a look at\r\nit. If, after quitting my house in a morning, it were to be lifted\r\nout of its site in the street by enchantment, and replaced by another\r\nwith a similar entrance, I should probably, even in the day time,\r\nenter it, without being struck by the change; and bees, if during\r\ntheir absence their old hive be taken away, and a similar one set in\r\nits place, enter this last, and if it be provided with brood comb\r\ncontentedly take up their abode in it, never troubling themselves to\r\ninquire what has become of the identical habitation which they left\r\nin the morning, and with the inhabitants of which, if it be removed\r\nto fifty paces distance, they never resume their connexion[828].\r\n\r\nIf, pursuing my illustration, you should object that no man would\r\nthus contentedly sit down in a new house without searching after the\r\nold one, you must bear in mind that I am not aiming to show that bees\r\nhave as precise a memory as ours, but only that they are endowed\r\nwith some portion of this faculty, which I think the above fact\r\nproves. Should you view it in a different light, you will not deny\r\nthe force of others that have already been stated in the course of\r\nour correspondence: such as the mutual greetings of ants of the same\r\nsociety when brought together after a separation of four months[829];\r\nand the return of a party of bees in spring to a window where in\r\nthe preceding autumn they had regaled on honey, though none of this\r\nsubstance had been again placed there[830].\r\n\r\nBut the most striking fact evincing the memory of these last-mentioned\r\ninsects has been communicated to me by my intelligent friend Mr.\r\nWilliam Stickney, of Ridgemont, Holderness. About twenty years ago, a\r\nswarm from one of this gentleman's hives took possession of an opening\r\nbeneath the tiles of his house, whence, after remaining a few hours,\r\nthey were dislodged and hived. For many subsequent years, when the\r\nhives descended from this stock were about to swarm, a considerable\r\nparty of scouts were observed for a few days before to be reconnoitring\r\nabout the old hole under the tiles; and Mr. Stickney is persuaded,\r\nthat if suffered they would have established themselves there. He is\r\ncertain that for eight years successively the descendants of the very\r\nstock that first took possession of the hole frequented it as above\r\nstated, and _not_ those of any other swarms; having constantly noticed\r\nthem, and ascertained that they were bees from the original hive by\r\npowdering them while about the tiles with yellow ochre, and watching\r\ntheir return. And even at the present time there are still seen every\r\nswarming season about the tiles, bees, which Mr. Stickney has no doubt\r\nare descendants from the original stock.\r\n\r\nHad Dr. Darwin been acquainted with this fact, he would have adduced\r\nit as proving that insects can convey traditionary information from\r\none generation to another; and at the first glance the circumstance\r\nof the descendants of the same stock retaining a knowledge of the\r\nsame fact for twenty years, during which period there must have been\r\nas many generations of bees, would seem to warrant the inference.\r\nBut as it is more probable that the party of surveying scouts of\r\nthe first generation was the next year accompanied by others of a\r\nsecond, who in like manner conducted their brethren of the third, and\r\nthese last again others of the fourth generation, and so on,--I draw\r\nno other conclusion from it than that bees are endowed with memory,\r\nwhich I think it proves most satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[760] _Hist.

The vessel having struck on some\r\nsands off the Point de Gat, at some distance from the shore, the ass\r\nwas thrown overboard to give it a chance of swimming to land--a poor\r\none, for the sea was running so high that a boat which left the ship\r\nwas lost. A few days afterwards, however, when the gates of Gibraltar\r\nwere opened in the morning, the ass presented himself for admittance,\r\nand proceeded to the stable of Mr. Weeks, a merchant, which he had\r\nformerly occupied, to the no small surprise of this gentleman, who\r\nimagined that from some accident the animal had never been shipped on\r\nboard the Ister. On the return of this vessel to repair, the mystery\r\nwas explained; and it turned out that Valiante (so the ass was called)\r\nhad not only swam safely to shore, but, without guide, compass, or\r\ntravelling map, had found his way from Point de Gat to Gibraltar, a\r\ndistance of more than two hundred miles, which he had never traversed\r\nbefore, through a mountainous and intricate country, intersected by\r\nstreams, and in so short a period that he could not have made one false\r\nturn. His not having been stopped on the road was attributed to the\r\ncircumstance of his having been formerly used to whip criminals upon,\r\nwhich was indicated to the peasants, who have a superstitious horror of\r\nsuch asses, by the holes in his ears, to which the persons flogged were\r\ntied.\r\n\r\n[800] Huber, ii. 64.\r\n\r\n[801] Ibid. ii. 138.\r\n\r\n[802] See above, p. 171--.\r\n\r\n[803] See above, p. 127--.\r\n\r\n[804] Huber, ii. 219.\r\n\r\n[805] Hume's _Essay on the Reason of Animals_.\r\n\r\n[806] See above, p. 263--.\r\n\r\n[807] Huber, ii. 289--.\r\n\r\n[808] See Fischer's _Beschreibung eines Huhns mit menschenähnlichem\r\nProfile_, 8vo, St. Petersburg 1816, and a translation in Thomson's\r\n_Annals of Phil._ viii. 241.\r\n\r\n[809] VOL.
