It is a means of imparting a knowledge of scientific facts\r\nand principles to unschooled minds. At the same time it affords a simple\r\nmethod of school instruction. Those who understand a business or an\r\ninstitution best, as a contemporary writer on finance remarks, are those\r\nwho have made it or grown up with it, and the next best thing is to know\r\nhow it has grown up, and then watch or take part in its actual working.\r\nGenerally speaking, we know best what we know in its origins.\r\n\r\nThe history of science is an aid in scientific research. It places the\r\nstudent in the current of scientific thought, and gives him a clue to\r\nthe purpose and necessity of the theories he is required to master. It\r\npresents science as the constant pursuit of truth rather than the\r\nformulation of truth long since revealed; it shows science as\r\nprogressive rather than fixed, dynamic rather than static, a growth to\r\nwhich each may contribute. It does not paralyze the self-activity of\r\nyouth by the record of an infallible past.\r\n\r\nIt is only by teaching the sciences in their historical development that\r\nthe schools can be true to the two principles of modern education, that\r\nthe sciences should occupy the foremost place in the curriculum and that\r\nthe individual mind in its evolution should rehearse the history of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe history of science should be given a larger place than at present in\r\ngeneral history; for, as Bacon said, the history of the world without a\r\nhistory of learning is like a statue of Polyphemus with the eye out. The\r\nhistory of science studies the past for the sake of the future. It is a\r\nstory of continuous progress. It is rich in biographical material. It\r\nshows the sciences in their interrelations, and saves the student from\r\nnarrowness and premature specialization. It affords a unique approach to\r\nthe study of philosophy. It gives new motive to the study of foreign\r\nlanguages. It gives an interest in the applications of knowledge, offers\r\na clue to the complex civilization of the present, and renders the mind\r\nhospitable to new discoveries and inventions.\r\n\r\nThe history of science is hostile to the spirit of caste. It shows the\r\nsciences rising from daily needs and occupations, formulated by\r\nphilosophy, enriching philosophy, giving rise to new industries, which\r\nreact in turn upon the sciences. The history of science reveals men of\r\nall grades of intelligence and of all social ranks coöperating in the\r\ncause of human progress. It is a basis of intellectual and social\r\nhomogeneity.\r\n\r\nScience is international, English, Germans, French, Italians,\r\nRussians--all nations--contributing to advance the general interests.\r\nAccordingly, a survey of the sciences tends to increase mutual respect,\r\nand to heighten the humanitarian sentiment. The history of science can\r\nbe taught to people of all creeds and colors, and cannot fail to enhance\r\nin the breast of every young man, or woman, faith in human progress and\r\ngood-will to all mankind.\r\n\r\nThis book is intended as a simple introduction, taking advantage of the\r\ninterests of youth of from seventeen to twenty-two years of age (and\r\ntheir intellectual compeers) in order to direct their attention to the\r\nstory of the development of the sciences. It makes no claim to be in any\r\nsense complete or comprehensive. It is, therefore, a psychological\r\nintroduction, having the mental capacity of a certain class of readers\r\nalways in view, rather than a logical introduction, which would\r\npresuppose in all readers both full maturity of intellect and\r\nconsiderable initial interest in the history of science.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this preface without thanking those who have assisted\r\nme in the preparation of this book--Sir William Osler, who read the\r\nfirst draft of the manuscript, and aided me with his counsel; Dr.\r\nCharles Singer, who read all the chapters in manuscript, and to whom I\r\nam indebted for advice in reference to the illustrations and for many\r\nother valuable suggestions; the officers of the Bodleian Library, whose\r\ncourtesy was unfailing during the year I worked there; Professor Henry\r\nCrew, who helped in the revision of two of the chapters by his judicious\r\ncriticism; Professor J. E. Rush, whose knowledge of bacteriology\r\nimproved the chapter on Pasteur; Professor L. O. Grondahl, who read one\r\nof the chapters relating to the history of physics and suggested\r\nimportant emendations; and Dr. John A. Brashear, who contributed\r\nvaluable information in reference to the activities of Samuel Pierpont\r\nLangley. I wish to express my gratitude also to Miss Florence Bonnet for\r\naid in the correction of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n W. LIBBY.\r\n\r\n February 2, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     I.

Great, indeed, as we shall see in the next chapter,\r\nare the contributions to the growth of science of this highly rational\r\nand speculative people. It must be conceded, also, that the influence on\r\nWestern science of civilizations earlier than theirs has come to us, to\r\na considerable extent at least, through the channels of Greek\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if you seek the very origins of the sciences, you will\r\ninevitably be drawn to the banks of the Nile, and to the valleys of the\r\nTigris and the Euphrates. Here, in Egypt, in Assyria and Babylonia,\r\ndwelt from very remote times nations whose genius was practical and\r\nreligious rather than intellectual and theoretical, and whose mental\r\nlife, therefore, was more akin to our own than was the highly evolved\r\nculture of the Greeks. Though more remote in time, the wisdom and\r\npractical knowledge of Thebes and Memphis, Nineveh and Babylon, are more\r\nreadily comprehended by our minds than the difficult speculations of\r\nAthenian philosophy.\r\n\r\nMuch that we have inherited from the earliest civilizations is so\r\nfamiliar, so homely, that we simply accept it, much as we may light, or\r\nair, or water, without analysis, without inquiry as to its origin, and\r\nwithout full recognition of how indispensable it is. Why are there seven\r\ndays in the week, and not eight? Why are there sixty minutes in the\r\nhour, and why are there not sixty hours in the day? These artificial\r\ndivisions of time are accepted so unquestioningly that to ask a reason\r\nfor them may, to an indolent mind, seem almost absurd. This acceptance\r\nof a week of seven days and of an hour of sixty minutes (almost as if\r\nthey were natural divisions of time like day and night) is owing to a\r\ntradition that is Babylonian in its origin. From the Old Testament\r\n(which is one of the greatest factors in preserving the continuity of\r\nhuman culture, and the only ancient book which speaks with authority\r\nconcerning Babylonian history) we learn that Abraham, the progenitor of\r\nthe Hebrews, migrated to the west from southern Babylonia about\r\ntwenty-three hundred years before Christ. Even in that remote age,\r\nhowever, the Babylonians had established those divisions of time which\r\nare familiar to us. The seven days of the week were closely associated\r\nin men's thinking with the heavenly bodies. In our modern languages they\r\nare named after the sun, the moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and\r\nSaturn, which from the remotest times were personified and worshiped.\r\nThus we see that the usage of making seven days a unit of time depends\r\non the religious belief and astronomical science of a very remote\r\ncivilization. The usage is so completely established that by the\r\nmajority it is simply taken for granted.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of commonplace knowledge--the cardinal points of the\r\ncompass--may be accepted, likewise, without inquiry or without\r\nrecognition of its importance. Unless thrown on your own resources in an\r\nunsettled country or on unknown waters, you may long fail to realize how\r\nindispensable to the practical conduct of life is the knowledge of east\r\nand west and north and south. In this matter, again, the records of\r\nancient civilizations show the pains that were taken to fix these\r\nessentials of science. Modern excavations have demonstrated that the\r\nsides or the corners of the temples and palaces of Assyria and Babylonia\r\nwere directed to the four cardinal points of the compass. In Egypt the\r\npyramids, erected before 3000 B.C., were laid out with such strict\r\nregard to direction that the conjecture has been put forward that their\r\nmain purpose was to establish, in a land of shifting sands, east and\r\nwest and north and south. That conjecture seems extravagant; but the\r\nfact that the Phœnicians studied astronomy merely because of its\r\npractical value in navigation, the early invention of the compass in\r\nChina, the influence on discovery of the later improvements of the\r\ncompass, make us realize the importance of the alleged purpose of the\r\npyramids. Without fixed points, without something to go by, men, before\r\nthey had acquired the elements of astronomy, were altogether at sea. As\r\nthey advanced in knowledge they looked to the stars for guidance,\r\nespecially to the pole star and the imperishable star-group of the\r\nnorthern heavens. The Egyptians even developed an apparatus for telling\r\nthe time by reference to the stars--a star-clock similar in its purpose\r\nto the sundial. By the Egyptians, also, was carefully observed the\r\nseason of the year at which certain stars and constellations were\r\nvisible at dawn. This was of special importance in the case of Sirius,\r\nfor its heliacal rising, that is, the period when it rose in conjunction\r\nwith the sun, marked the coming of the Nile flood (so important in the\r\nlives of the inhabitants) and the beginning of a new year. Not\r\nunnaturally Sirius was an object of worship. One temple is said to have\r\nbeen so constructed as to face that part of the eastern horizon at which\r\nthis star arose at the critical season of inundation. Of another temple\r\nwe are told that only at sunset at the time of the summer solstice did\r\nthe sun throw its rays throughout the edifice. The fact that astronomy\r\nin Egypt as in Babylonia, where the temples were observatories, was\r\nclosely associated with religion confirms the view that this science was\r\nfirst cultivated because of its bearing on the practical needs of the\r\npeople. The priests were the preservers of such wisdom as had been\r\naccumulated in the course of man's immemorial struggle with the forces\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that geometry had its origin in the valley of the Nile,\r\nthat it arose to meet a practical need, and that it was in the first\r\nplace, as its name implies, a measurement of the earth--a crude\r\nsurveying, employed in the restoration of boundaries obliterated by the\r\nannual inundations of the river. Egyptian geometry cared little for\r\ntheory. It addressed itself to actual problems, such as determining the\r\narea of a square or triangular field from the length of the sides. To\r\nfind the area of a circular field, or floor, or vessel, from the length\r\nof the diameter was rather beyond the science of 2000 B.C. This was,\r\nhowever, a practical problem which had to be solved, even if the\r\nsolution were not perfect. The practice was to square the diameter\r\nreduced by one ninth.\r\n\r\nIn all the Egyptian mathematics of which we have record there is to be\r\nobserved a similar practical bent. In the construction of a temple or a\r\npyramid not merely was it necessary to have regard to the points of the\r\ncompass, but care must be taken to have the sides at right angles. This\r\nrequired the intervention of specialists, expert \"rope-fasteners,\" who\r\nlaid off a triangle by means of a rope divided into three parts, of\r\nthree, four, and five units. The Babylonians followed much the same\r\npractice in fixing a right angle. In addition they learned how to bisect\r\nand trisect the angle. Hence we see in their designs and ornaments the\r\ndivision of the circle into twelve parts, a division which does not\r\nappear in Egyptian ornamentation till after the incursion of Babylonian\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThere is no need, however, to multiply examples; the tendency of all\r\nEgyptian mathematics was, as already stated, concerned with the\r\npractical solution of concrete problems--mensuration, the cubical\r\ncontents of barns and granaries, the distribution of bread, the amounts\r\nof food required by men and animals in given numbers and for given\r\nperiods of time, the proportions and the angle of elevation (about 52°)\r\nof a pyramid, etc. Moreover, they worked simple equations involving one\r\nunknown, and had a hieroglyph for a million (the drawing of a man\r\novercome with wonder), and another for ten million.\r\n\r\nThe Rhind mathematical papyrus in the British Museum is the main source\r\nof our present knowledge of early Egyptian arithmetic, geometry, and of\r\nwhat might be called their trigonometry and algebra. It describes itself\r\nas \"Instructions for arriving at the knowledge of all things, and of\r\nthings obscure, and of all mysteries.\" It was copied by a priest about\r\n1600 B.C.--the classical period of Egyptian culture--from a document\r\nseven hundred years older.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLIEST PICTURE KNOWN OF A SURGICAL OPERATION. EGYPT,\r\n2500 B.C.]\r\n\r\nMedicine, which is almost certain to develop in the early history of a\r\npeople in response to their urgent needs, has been justly called the\r\nfoster-mother of many sciences. In the records of Egyptian medical\r\npractice can be traced the origin of chemistry, anatomy, physiology, and\r\nbotany. Our most definite information concerning Egyptian medicine\r\nbelongs to the same general period as the mathematical document to which\r\nwe have just referred. It is true something is known of remoter times.\r\nThe first physician of whom history has preserved the name, I-em-hetep\r\n(He-who-cometh-in-peace), lived about 4500 B.C. Recent researches have\r\nalso brought to light, near Memphis, pictures, not later than 2500 B.C.,\r\nof surgical operations. They were found sculptured on the doorposts at\r\nthe entrance to the tomb of a high official of one of the Pharaohs. The\r\npatients, as shown in the accompanying illustration, are suffering pain,\r\nand, according to the inscription, one cries out, \"Do this [and] let me\r\ngo,\" and the other, \"Don't hurt me so!\" Our most satisfactory data in\r\nreference to Egyptian medicine are derived, however, from the Ebers\r\npapyrus. This document displays some little knowledge of the pulse in\r\ndifferent parts of the body, of a relation between the heart and the\r\nother organs, and of the passage of the breath to the lungs (and heart).\r\nIt contains a list of diseases. In the main it is a collection of\r\nprescriptions for the eyes, ears, stomach, to reduce tumors, effect\r\npurgation, etc. There is no evidence of a tendency to homeopathy, but\r\nmental healing seems to have been called into play by the use of\r\nnumerous spells and incantations. Each prescription, as in medical\r\npractice to-day, contains as a rule several ingredients. Among the seven\r\nhundred recognized remedies are to be noted poppy, castor-oil, gentian,\r\ncolchicum, squills, and many other familiar medicinal plants, as well as\r\nbicarbonate of soda, antimony, and salts of lead and copper. The fat of\r\nthe lion, hippopotamus, crocodile, goose, serpent, and wild goat, in\r\nequal parts, served as a prescription for baldness. In the interests of\r\nhis art the medical practitioner ransacked the resources of organic and\r\ninorganic nature. The Ebers papyrus shows that the Egyptians knew of the\r\ndevelopment of the beetle from the egg, of the blow-fly from the larva,\r\nand of the frog from the tadpole. Moreover, for precision in the use of\r\nmedicaments weights of very small denominations were employed.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian embalmers relied on the preservative properties of common\r\nsalt, wine, aromatics, myrrh, cassia, etc. By the use of linen smeared\r\nwith gum they excluded all putrefactive agencies. They understood the\r\nvirtue of extreme dryness in the exercise of their antiseptic art. Some\r\nknowledge of anatomy was involved in the removal of the viscera, and\r\nmuch more in a particular method they followed in removing the brain.\r\n\r\nIn their various industries the Egyptians made use of gold, silver,\r\nbronze (which on analysis is found to consist of copper, tin, and a\r\ntrace of lead, etc.), metallic iron and copper and their oxides,\r\nmanganese, cobalt, alum, cinnabar, indigo, madder, brass, white lead,\r\nlampblack. There is clear evidence that they smelted iron ore as early\r\nas 3400 B.C. maintaining a blast by means of leather tread-bellows. They\r\nalso contrived to temper the metal, and to make helmets, swords,\r\nlance-points, ploughs, tools, and other implements of iron. Besides\r\nmetallurgy they practiced the arts of weaving, dyeing, distillation.\r\nThey produced soap (from soda and oil), transparent and colored glass,\r\nenamel, and ceramics. They were skilled in the preparation of leather.\r\nThey showed aptitude for painting, and for the other fine arts. They\r\nwere expert builders, and possessed the engineering skill to erect\r\nobelisks weighing hundreds of tons. They cultivated numerous vegetables,\r\ngrains, fruits, and flowers. They had many domestic animals. In seeking\r\nthe satisfaction of their practical needs they laid the foundation of\r\ngeometry, botany, chemistry (named, as some think, from the Egyptian\r\nKhem, the god of medicinal herbs), and other sciences. But their\r\npractical achievements far transcended their theoretical formulations.\r\nTo all time they will be known as an artistic, noble, and religious\r\npeople, who cherished their dead and would not allow that the good and\r\nbeautiful and great should altogether pass away.\r\n\r\nExcavations in Assyria and Babylonia, especially since 1843, have\r\nbrought to our knowledge an ancient culture stretching back four or five\r\nthousand years before the beginning of the Christian era. The records of\r\nAssyria and Babylonia, like those of Egypt, are fragmentary and still in\r\nneed of interpretation. Here again, however, it is the fundamental, the\r\nindispensable, the practical forms of knowledge that stand revealed\r\nrather than the theoretical, speculative, and purely intellectual.\r\n\r\nBy the Babylonian priests the heavens were made the object of expert\r\nobservation as early as 3800 B.C. The length of the year, the length of\r\nthe month, the coming of the seasons, the course of the sun in the\r\nheavens, the movements of the planets, the recurrence of eclipses,\r\ncomets, and meteors, were studied with particular care. One motive was\r\nthe need of a measurement of time, the same motive as underlies the\r\ncommon interest in the calendar and almanac. It was found that the year\r\ncontained more than 365 days, the month (synodic) more than 29 days, 12\r\nhours, and 44 minutes. The sun's apparent diameter was contained 720\r\ntimes in the ecliptic, that is, in the apparent path of the sun through\r\nthe heavens. Like the Egyptians, the Babylonians took special note of\r\nthe stars and star-groups that were to be seen at dawn at different\r\ntimes of the year. These constellations, lying in the imaginary\r\nbelt encircling the heavens on either side of the ecliptic, bore\r\nnames corresponding to those we have adopted for the signs of the\r\nzodiac,--Balance, Ram, Bull, Twins, Scorpion, Archer, etc. The\r\nBabylonian astronomers also observed that the successive vernal (or\r\nautumnal) equinoxes follow each other at intervals of a few seconds\r\nless than a year.\r\n\r\nA second motive that influenced the Babylonian priests in studying the\r\nmovements of the heavenly bodies was the hope of foretelling events. The\r\nplanets, seen to shift their positions with reference to the other\r\nheavenly bodies, were called messengers, or angels. The appearance of\r\nMars, perhaps on account of its reddish color, was associated in their\r\nimaginations with war. Comets, meteors, and eclipses were considered as\r\nomens portending pestilence, national disaster, or the fate of kings.\r\nThe fortunes of individuals could be predicted from a knowledge of the\r\naspect of the heavens at the hour of their birth. This interest in\r\nastrology, or divination by means of the stars, no doubt stimulated the\r\npriests to make careful observations and to preserve religiously the\r\nrecord of astronomical phenomena. It was even established that there is\r\na cycle in which eclipses, solar and lunar, repeat themselves, a period\r\n(_saros_) somewhat more than eighteen years and eleven months. Moreover,\r\nfrom the Babylonians we derive some of our most sublime religious and\r\nscientific conceptions. They held that strict law governs the apparently\r\nerratic movements of the heavenly bodies. Their creation myth proclaims:\r\n\"Merodach next arranged the stars in order, along with the sun and moon,\r\nand gave them laws which they were never to transgress.\"\r\n\r\nThe mathematical knowledge of the Babylonians is related on the one hand\r\nto their astronomy and on the other to their commercial pursuits. They\r\npossessed highly developed systems of measuring, weighing, and\r\ncounting--processes, which, as we shall see in the sequel, are essential\r\nto scientific thought. About 2300 B.C. they had multiplication tables\r\nrunning from 1 to 1350, which were probably used in connection with\r\nastronomical calculations. Unlike the Egyptians they had no symbol for a\r\nmillion, though the \"ten thousand times ten thousand\" of the Bible\r\n(Daniel VII: 10) may indicate that the conception of even larger numbers\r\nwas not altogether foreign to them. They counted in sixties as well as\r\nin tens. Their hours and minutes had each sixty subdivisions. They\r\ndivided the circle into six parts and into six-times-sixty subdivisions.\r\nTables of squares and cubes discovered in southern Babylonia were\r\ninterpreted correctly only on a sexagesimal basis, the statement that 1\r\nplus 4 is the square of 8 implying that the first unit is 60. As we have\r\nalready seen, considerable knowledge of geometry is apparent in\r\nBabylonian designs and constructions.\r\n\r\nAccording to a Greek historian of the fifth century B.C., there were no\r\nphysicians at Babylon, while a later Greek historian (of the first\r\ncentury B.C.) speaks of a Babylonian university which had attained\r\ncelebrity, and which is now believed to have been a school of medicine.\r\nModern research has made known letters by a physician addressed to an\r\nAssyrian king in the seventh century B.C. referring to the king's chief\r\nphysician, giving directions for the treatment of a bleeding from the\r\nnose from which a friend of the prince was suffering, and reporting the\r\nprobable recovery of a poor fellow whose eyes were diseased. Other\r\nletters from the same general period mention the presence of physicians\r\nat court. We have even recovered the name (Ilu-bani) of a physician who\r\nlived in southern Babylonia about 2700 B.C. The most interesting\r\ninformation, however, in reference to Babylonian medicine dates from the\r\ntime of Hammurabi, a contemporary of the patriarch Abraham. It appears\r\nfrom the code drawn up in the reign of that monarch that the Babylonian\r\nsurgeons operated in case of cataract; that they were entitled to twenty\r\nsilver shekels (half the sum for which Joseph was sold into slavery, and\r\nequivalent to seven or eight dollars) for a successful operation; and\r\nthat in case the patient lost his life or his sight as the result of an\r\nunsuccessful operation, the surgeon was condemned to have his hands\r\namputated.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian records of medicine like those of astronomy reveal the\r\nprevalence of many superstitious beliefs. The spirits of evil bring\r\nmaladies upon us; the gods heal the diseases that afflict us. The\r\nBabylonian books of medicine contained strange interminglings of\r\nprescription and incantation. The priests studied the livers of\r\nsacrificial animals in order to divine the thoughts of the gods--a\r\npractice which stimulated the study of anatomy. The maintenance of state\r\nmenageries no doubt had a similar influence on the study of the natural\r\nhistory of animals.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonians were a nation of agriculturists and merchants. Sargon of\r\nAkkad, who founded the first Semitic empire in Asia (3800 B.C.), was\r\nbrought up by an irrigator, and was himself a gardener. Belshazzar, the\r\nson of the last Babylonian king, dealt in wool on a considerable scale.\r\nExcavation in the land watered by the Tigris and Euphrates tells the\r\ntale of the money-lenders, importers, dyers, fullers, tanners,\r\nsaddlers, smiths, carpenters, shoemakers, stonecutters, ivory-cutters,\r\nbrickmakers, porcelain-makers, potters, vintners, sailors, butchers,\r\nengineers, architects, painters, sculptors, musicians, dealers in rugs,\r\nclothing and fabrics, who contributed to the culture of this great\r\nhistoric people. It is not surprising that science should find its\r\nmatrix in so rich a civilization.\r\n\r\nThe lever and the pulley, lathes, picks, saws, hammers, bronze\r\noperating-lances, sundials, water-clocks, the gnomon (a vertical pillar\r\nfor determining the sun's altitude) were in use. Gem-cutting was highly\r\ndeveloped as early as 3800 B.C. The Babylonians made use of copper\r\nhardened with antimony and tin, lead, incised shells, glass, alabaster,\r\nlapis-lazuli, silver, and gold. Iron was not employed before the period\r\nof contact with Egyptian civilization. Their buildings were furnished\r\nwith systems of drains and flushes that seem to us altogether modern.\r\nOur museums are enriched by specimens of their handicraft--realistic\r\nstatuary in dolerite of 2700 B.C.; rock crystal worked to the form of a\r\nplano-convex lens, 3800 B.C.; a beautiful silver vase of the period 3950\r\nB.C.; and the head of a goat in copper about 4000 B.C.\r\n\r\nExcavation has not disclosed nor scholarship interpreted the full record\r\nof this ancient people in the valley of the Tigris and the Euphrates,\r\nnot far from the Gulf of Persia, superior in religious inspiration, not\r\ninferior in practical achievements to the Egyptians. Both these great\r\nnations of antiquity, however, failed to carry the sciences that arose\r\nin connection with their arts to a high degree of generalization. That\r\nwas reserved for another people of ancient times, namely, the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n F. H. Garrison, _An Introduction to the History of Medicine_.\r\n\r\n H. V.

Thales (640-546 B.C.),\r\nwho is usually regarded as the first of the Greek philosophers, was the\r\nfounder of Greek geometry and astronomy. He was one of the seven \"wise\r\nmen\" of Greece, and might be called the Benjamin Franklin of antiquity,\r\nfor he was interested in commerce, famous for political sagacity, and\r\nhonored for his disinterested love of general truth. His birthplace was\r\nMiletus, a Greek city on the coast of Asia Minor. There is evidence that\r\nhe acquired a knowledge of Babylonian astronomy. The pursuit of commerce\r\ncarried him to Egypt, and there he gained a knowledge of geometry. Not\r\nonly so, but he was able to advance this study by generalizing and\r\nformulating its truths. For the Egyptians, geometry was concerned with\r\nsurfaces and dimensions, with areas and cubical contents; for the Greek,\r\nwith his powers of abstraction, it became a study of line and angle. For\r\nexample, Thales saw that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle\r\nare equal, and that when two straight lines cut one another the\r\nvertically opposite angles are equal. However, after having established\r\ngeneral principles, he showed himself capable of applying them to the\r\nsolution of particular problems. In the presence of the Egyptian\r\npriests, to which class he was solely indebted for instruction, Thales\r\ndemonstrated a method of measuring the height of a pyramid by reference\r\nto its shadow. And again, on the basis of his knowledge of the relation\r\nof the sides of a triangle to its angles, he developed a practical rule\r\nfor ascertaining the distance of a ship from the shore.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical mind of Thales laid hold, no doubt, of some of the\r\nessentials of astronomical science. The particulars usually brought\r\nforward to prove his originality tend rather to show his indebtedness to\r\nthe Babylonians. The number of days in the year, the length of the\r\nsynodic month, the relation of the sun's apparent diameter to the\r\necliptic, the times of recurrence of eclipses, were matters that had\r\nlong been known to the Babylonians, as well as to the Chinese. However,\r\nhe aroused great interest in astronomy among the Greeks by the\r\nprediction of a solar eclipse. This was probably the eclipse of 585\r\nB.C., which interrupted a fierce battle between the Medes and the\r\nLydians. The advice of Thales to mariners to steer by the Lesser Bear,\r\nas nearer the pole, rather than by the Great Bear, shows also that in\r\nhis astronomical studies as in his geometrical he was not indifferent to\r\nthe applications of scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some writers maintain that Thales was not a philosopher at all,\r\nbut rather an astronomer and engineer. We know very little of his purely\r\nspeculative thought. We do know, however, that he arrived at a\r\ngeneralization--fantastic to most minds--that all things are water.\r\nAttempts have been made to add to this statement, and to explain it\r\naway. Its great interest for the history of thought lies in the fact\r\nthat it is the result of seeking the constant in the variable, the\r\nunitary principle in the multiple phenomena of nature. This abstract and\r\ngeneral view (though perhaps suggested by the Babylonian belief that the\r\nworld originated in a watery chaos, or by the teaching of Egyptian\r\npriests) was preëminently Greek, and was the first of a series of\r\nattempts to discover the basis or origin of all things. One of the\r\nfollowers of Thales taught that air was the fundamental principle; while\r\nHeraclitus, anticipating to some extent modern theories of the origin of\r\nthe cosmos, declared in favor of a fiery vapor subject to ceaseless\r\nchange. Empedocles, the great philosopher-physician, first set forth the\r\ndoctrine of the four _elements_--earth, air, fire, and water. For\r\nDemocritus indivisible particles or atoms are fundamental to all\r\nphenomena. It is evident that the theory of Thales was a starting point\r\nfor Greek abstract thought, and that his inclination to seek out\r\nprinciples and general laws accounts for his influence on the\r\ndevelopment both of philosophy and the sciences.\r\n\r\nPythagoras, on the advice of Thales, visited Egypt in the pursuit of\r\nmathematics. There is reason to believe that he also visited Babylonia.\r\nFor him and his followers mathematics became a philosophy--almost a\r\nreligion. They had discovered (by experimenting with the monochord, the\r\nfirst piece of physical-laboratory apparatus, consisting of a tense\r\nharpstring with a movable bridge) the effect on the tone of the string\r\nof a musical instrument when the length is reduced by one half, and also\r\nthat strings of like thickness and under equal tension yield harmonious\r\ntones when their lengths are related as 1:2, 2:3, 3:4, 4:5. The\r\nPythagoreans drew from this the extravagant inference that the heavenly\r\nbodies would be in distance from the earth as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Much\r\nof their theory must seem to the modern mind merely fanciful and\r\nunsupported speculation. At the same time it is only just to this school\r\nof philosophers to recognize that their assumption that simple\r\nmathematical relationships govern the phenomena of nature has had an\r\nimmense influence on the advance of the sciences. Whether their\r\nfanaticism for number was owing to the influence of Egyptian priests or\r\nhad an Oriental origin, it gave to the Pythagoreans an enthusiasm for\r\npure mathematics. They disregarded the bearing of their science on the\r\npractical needs of life. Old problems like squaring the circle,\r\ntrisecting the angle, and doubling the cube, were now attempted in a new\r\nspirit and with fresh vigor. The first, second, and fourth books of\r\nEuclid are largely of Pythagorean origin. For solid geometry as a\r\nscience we are also indebted to this sect of number-worshipers. One of\r\nthem (Archytas, 428-347 B.C., a friend of Plato) was the first to apply\r\ngeometry to mechanics. We see again here, as in the case of Thales, that\r\nthe love of abstract thought, the pursuit of science as science, did not\r\ninterfere with ultimate practical applications.\r\n\r\nPlato (429-347 B.C.), like many other Greek philosophers, traveled\r\nextensively, visiting Asia Minor, Egypt, and Lower Italy, where\r\nPythagorean influence was particularly strong. His chief interest lay in\r\nspeculation. For him there were two worlds, the world of sense and the\r\nworld of ideas. The senses deceive us; therefore, the philosopher should\r\nturn his back upon the world of sensible impressions, and develop the\r\nreason. In his _Dialogues_ he outlined a course of training and study,\r\nthe professed object of which was to educate a class of philosophers.\r\n(Strange to say, Plato's curriculum, planned originally for the\r\nintellectual _élite_, still dictates in our schools the education of\r\nmillions of boys and girls whose careers do not call for a training\r\nmerely of the reason.)\r\n\r\nOver the porch of his school, the Academy at Athens, were inscribed the\r\nwords, \"Let no one who is unacquainted with geometry enter here.\" It was\r\nnot because it was useful in everyday life that Plato laid such\r\ninsistence on this study, but because it increased the students' powers\r\nof abstraction and trained the mind to correct and vigorous thinking.\r\nFrom his point of view the chief good of geometry is lost unless we can\r\nthrough it withdraw the mind from the particular and the material. He\r\ndelighted in clearness of conception. His main scientific interest was\r\nin astronomy and mathematics. We owe to him the definition of a line as\r\n\"length without breadth,\" and the formulation of the axiom, \"Equals\r\nsubtracted from equals leave equals.\"\r\n\r\nPlato had an immediate influence in stimulating mathematical studies,\r\nand has been called a maker of mathematicians. Euclid, who was active at\r\nAlexandria toward the end of the fourth century B.C., was not one of\r\nPlato's immediate disciples but shared the great philosopher's point of\r\nview. The story is told that one of his pupils, arrived perhaps at the\r\n_pons asinorum_, asked, \"What do I get by learning these things?\"\r\nEuclid, calling his servant, said, \"Give him sixpence, since he must\r\nmake gain out of what he learns.\" Adults were also found, even among the\r\nnimble-witted Greeks, to whom abstract reasoning was not altogether\r\ncongenial. This is attested by the familiar story of Ptolemy, King of\r\nEgypt, who once asked Euclid whether geometry could not be learned in\r\nsome easier way than by studying the geometer's book, _The Elements_. To\r\nthis the schoolmaster replied, \"There is no royal road to geometry.\" For\r\nthe academic intelligence abstract and abstruse mathematics are tonic\r\nand an end in themselves. As already stated, their ultimate practical\r\nvalue is also immense. One of Plato's associates, working under his\r\ndirection, investigated the curves produced by cutting cones of\r\ndifferent kinds in a certain plane. These curves--the ellipse, the\r\nparabola, the hyperbola--play a large part in the subsequent history of\r\nastronomy and mechanics. Another Platonist made the first measurement of\r\nthe earth's circumference.\r\n\r\nAristotle, the greatest pupil of Plato, was born at Stagira in 384 B.C.\r\nHe came of a family of physicians, was trained for the medical\r\nprofession, and had his attention early directed to natural phenomena.\r\nHe entered the Academy at Athens about 367 B.C., and studied there till\r\nthe death of Plato twenty years later. He was a diligent but, as was\r\nnatural, considering the character of his early education, by no means a\r\npassive student. Plato said that Aristotle reacted against his\r\ninstructor as a vigorous colt kicks the mother that nourishes it. The\r\nphysician's son did not accept without modification the view that the\r\nphilosopher should turn his back upon the things of sense. He had been\r\ntrained in the physical science of the time, and believed in the reality\r\nof concrete things. At the same time he absorbed what he found of value\r\nin his master's teachings. He thought that science did not consist in a\r\nmere study of individual things, but that we must pass on to a\r\nformulation of general principles and then return to a study of the\r\nconcrete. His was a great systematizing intellect, which has left its\r\nimprint on nearly every department of knowledge. Physical astronomy,\r\nphysical geography, meteorology, physics, chemistry, geology, botany,\r\nanatomy, physiology, embryology, and zoölogy were enriched by his\r\nteaching. It was through him that logic, ethics, psychology, rhetoric,\r\næsthetics, political science, zoölogy (especially ichthyology), first\r\nreceived systematic treatment. As a great modern philosopher has said,\r\nAristotle pressed his way through the mass of things knowable, and\r\nsubjected its diversity to the power of his thought. No wonder that for\r\nages he was known as \"The Philosopher,\" master of those who know. His\r\npurpose was to comprehend, to define, to classify the phenomena of\r\norganic and inorganic nature, to systematize the knowledge of his own\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTwenty years' apprenticeship in the school of Plato had sharpened his\r\nlogical powers and added to his stock of general ideas, but had not\r\ntaught him to distrust his senses. When we say that our eyes deceive us,\r\nwe really confess that we have misinterpreted the data that our sight\r\nhas furnished. Properly to know involves the right use of the senses as\r\nwell as the right use of reason. The advance of science depends on the\r\ndevelopment both of speculation and observation. Aristotle advised\r\ninvestigators to make sure of the facts before seeking the explanation\r\nof the facts. Where preconceived theory was at variance with observed\r\nfacts, the former must of course give way. Though it has been said that\r\nwhile Plato was a dreamer, Aristotle was a thinker, yet it must be\r\nacknowledged in qualification that Plato often showed genuine knowledge\r\nof natural phenomena in anatomy and other departments of study, and that\r\nAristotle was carried away at times by his own presuppositions, or\r\nfailed to bring his theories to the test of observation. The Stagirite\r\nheld that the velocity of falling bodies is proportional to their\r\nweight, that the function of the diaphragm is to divide the region of\r\nthe nobler from that of the animal passions, and that the brain is\r\nintended to act in opposition to the heart, the brain being formed of\r\nearthy and watery material, which brings about a cooling effect. The\r\ntheory of the four elements--the hot, the cold, the moist, the dry--led\r\nto dogmatic statements with little attempt at verification. From the\r\nstandpoint of modern studies it is easy to point out the mistakes of\r\nAristotle even. Science is progressive, not infallible.\r\n\r\nIn his own time he was rather reproached for what was considered an\r\nundignified and sordid familiarity with observed facts. His critics said\r\nthat having squandered his patrimony, he had served in the army, and,\r\nfailing there, had become a _seller of drugs_. His observations on the\r\neffects of heat seem to have been drawn from the common processes of the\r\nhome and the workshop. Even in the ripening of fruits heat appears to\r\nhim to have a cooking effect. Heat distorts articles made of potters'\r\nclay after they have been hardened by cold. Again we find him describing\r\nthe manufacture of potash and of steel. He is not disdainful of the\r\nstudy of the lower animals, but invites us to investigate all forms in\r\nthe expectancy of discovering something natural and beautiful. In a\r\nsimilar spirit of scientific curiosity the Aristotelian work _The\r\nProblems_ studies the principle of the lever, the rudder, the wheel and\r\naxle, the forceps, the balance, the beam, the wedge, as well as other\r\nmechanical principles.\r\n\r\nIn Aristotle, in fact, we find a mind exceptionally able to form clear\r\nideas, and at the same time to observe the rich variety of nature. He\r\npaid homage both to the multiplicity and the uniformity of nature, the\r\nwealth of the phenomena and the simplicity of the law explaining the\r\nphenomena. Many general and abstract ideas (category, energy,\r\nentomology, essence, mean between extremes, metaphysics, meteorology,\r\nmotive, natural history, principle, syllogism) have through the\r\ninfluence of Aristotle become the common property of educated people the\r\nworld over.\r\n\r\nPlato was a mathematician and an astronomer. Aristotle was first and\r\nforemost a biologist. His books treated the history of animals, the\r\nparts of animals, the locomotion of animals, the generation of animals,\r\nrespiration, life and death, length and shortness of life, youth and old\r\nage. His psychology is, like that of the present day, a biological\r\npsychology. In his contributions to biological science is manifested\r\nhis characteristic inclination to be at once abstract and concrete. His\r\nworks display a knowledge of over five hundred living forms. He\r\ndissected specimens of fifty different species of animals. One might\r\nmention especially his minute knowledge of the sea-urchin, of the murex\r\n(source of the famous Tyrian dye), of the chameleon, of the habits of\r\nthe torpedo, the so-called fishing-frog, and nest-making fishes, as well\r\nas of the manner of reproduction of whales and certain species of\r\nsharks. One of his chief contributions to anatomy is the description of\r\nthe heart and of the arrangement of the blood-vessels. A repugnance to\r\nthe dissection of the human body seems to have checked to some extent\r\nhis curiosity in reference to the anatomy of man, but he was acquainted\r\nwith the structure of the internal ear, the passage leading from the\r\npharynx to the middle ear, and the two outer membranes of the brain of\r\nman. Aristotle's genius did not permit him to get lost in the mere\r\ndetails of observed phenomena. He recognized resemblances and\r\ndifferences between the various species, classified animals as belonging\r\nto two large groups, distinguished whales and dolphins from fishes,\r\nrecognized the family likeness of the domestic pigeon, the wood pigeon,\r\nthe rock pigeon, and the turtle dove. He laid down the characteristics\r\nof the class of invertebrates to which octopus and sepia belong. Man\r\ntakes a place in Aristotle's system of nature as a social animal, the\r\nhighest type of the whole series of living beings, characterized by\r\ncertain powers of recall, reason, deliberation. Of course it was not to\r\nbe expected that Aristotle should work out a fully satisfactory\r\nclassification of all the varieties of plants and animals known to him.\r\nYet his purpose and method mark him as the father of natural science. He\r\nhad the eye to observe and the mind to grasp the relationships and the\r\nimport of what he observed. His attempt to classify animals according to\r\nthe nature of their teeth (dentition) has been criticized as\r\nunsuccessful, but this principle of classification is still of use,\r\nand may be regarded as typical of his mind, at once careful and\r\ncomprehensive.\r\n\r\nOne instance of Aristotle's combining philosophical speculation with\r\nacute observation of natural phenomena is afforded by his work on\r\ngeneration and development. He knew that the transmission of life\r\ndeserves special study as the predominant function of the various\r\nspecies of plants and animals. Deformed parents may have well-formed\r\noffspring. Children may resemble grandparents rather than parents. It is\r\nonly toward the close of its development that the embryo exhibits the\r\ncharacteristics of its parent species. Aristotle traced with some care\r\nthe embryological development of the chick from the fourth day of\r\nincubation. His knowledge of the propagation of animals was, however,\r\nnot sufficient to make him reject the belief in spontaneous generation\r\nfrom mud, sand, foam, and dew. His errors are readily comprehensible,\r\nas, for example, in attributing spontaneous generation to eels, the\r\nhabits and mode of reproduction of which only recent studies have made\r\nfully known. In regard to generation, as in other scientific fields, the\r\nphilosophic mind of Aristotle anticipated modern theories, and also\r\nraised general questions only to be solved by later investigation of the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nOnly one indication need be given of the practical results that flowed\r\nfrom Aristotle's scientific work. In one of his writings he has stated\r\nthat the sphericity of the earth can be observed from the fact that its\r\nshadow on the moon at the time of eclipse is an arc. That it is both\r\nspherical and small in comparison with the heavenly bodies appears,\r\nmoreover, from this, that stars visible in Egypt are invisible in\r\ncountries farther north; while stars always above the horizon in\r\nnorthern countries are seen to set from countries to the south.\r\nConsequently the earth is not only spherical but also not large;\r\notherwise this phenomenon would not present itself on so limited a\r\nchange of position on the part of the observer. \"It seems, therefore,\r\nnot incredible that the region about the Pillars of Hercules [Gibraltar]\r\nis connected with that of India, and that there is thus only one ocean.\"\r\nIt is known that this passage from _The Philosopher_ influenced Columbus\r\nin his undertaking to reach the Orient by sailing west from the coast of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nWe must pass over Aristotle's observation of a relationship (homology)\r\nbetween the arms of man, the forelegs of quadrupeds, the wings of birds,\r\nand the pectoral fins of fishes, as well as many other truths to which\r\nhis genius for generalization led him.\r\n\r\nIn the field of botany Aristotle had a wide knowledge of natural\r\nphenomena, and raised general questions as to mode of propagation,\r\nnourishment, relation of plants to animals, etc. His pupil and lifelong\r\nfriend, and successor as leader of the Peripatetic school of philosophy,\r\nTheophrastus, combined a knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, botany,\r\nand mineralogy. His _History of Plants_ describes about five hundred\r\nspecies. At the same time he treats the general principles of botany,\r\nthe distribution of plants, the nourishment of the plant through leaf as\r\nwell as root, the sexuality of date palm and terebinth. He lays great\r\nstress on the uses of plants. His classification of plants is inferior\r\nto Aristotle's classification of animals. His views in reference to\r\nspontaneous generation are more guarded than those of his master. His\r\nwork _On Stones_ is dominated by the practical rather than the\r\ngeneralizing spirit. It is evidently inspired by a knowledge of mines,\r\nsuch as the celebrated Laurium, from which Athens drew its supply of\r\nsilver, and the wealth from which enabled the Athenians to develop a\r\nsea-power that overmatched that of the Persians. Even to-day enough\r\nremains of the galleries, shafts, scoria, mine-lamps, and other utensils\r\nto give a clear idea of this scene of ancient industry. Theophrastus\r\nconsidered the medicinal uses of minerals as well as of plants.\r\n\r\nWe have failed to mention Hippocrates (460-370 B.C.), the Father of\r\nMedicine, in whom is found an intimate union of practical science and\r\nspeculative philosophy. We must also pass over such later Greek\r\nscientists as Aristarchus and Hipparchus who confuted the theories of\r\nPythagoras and Plato in reference to the relative distances of the\r\nheavenly bodies from the earth. Archimedes of Syracuse demands, however,\r\nparticular consideration. He lived in the third century B.C., and has\r\nbeen called the greatest mathematician of antiquity. In him we find the\r\ndevotion to the abstract that marked the Greek intelligence. He went so\r\nfar as to say that every kind of art is ignoble if connected with daily\r\nneeds. His interest lay in abstruse mathematical problems. His special\r\npride was in having determined the relative dimensions of the sphere and\r\nthe enclosing cylinder. He worked out the principle of the lever. \"Give\r\nme,\" he said, \"a place on which to stand and I will move the earth.\" He\r\napproximated more closely than the Egyptians the solution of the problem\r\nof the relation between the area of a circle and the radius. His work\r\nhad practical value in spite of himself. At the request of his friend\r\nthe King of Sicily, he applied his ingenuity to discover whether a\r\ncertain crown were pure gold or alloyed with silver, and he hit upon a\r\nmethod which has found many applications in the industries. His name is\r\nassociated with the endless screw. In fact, his practical contrivances\r\nwon such repute that it is not easy to separate the historical facts\r\nfrom the legends that enshroud his name. He aided in the defense of his\r\nnative city against the Romans in 212 B.C., and devised war-engines with\r\nwhich to repel the besiegers. After the enemy had entered the city, says\r\ntradition, he stood absorbed in a mathematical problem which he had\r\ndiagrammed on the sand. As a rude Roman soldier approached, Archimedes\r\ncried, \"Don't spoil my circles,\" and was instantly killed. The\r\nvictorious general, however, buried him with honor, and on the tomb of\r\nthe mathematician caused to be inscribed the sphere with its enclosing\r\ncylinder. The triumphs of Greek abstract thought teach the lesson that\r\npractical men should pay homage to speculation even when they fail to\r\ncomprehend a fraction of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Aristotle, _Historia Animalium_; translated by D'A.

He was employed in the\r\nservice of the Roman State at the time of Augustus, shortly before the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era. He planned basilicas and aqueducts, and\r\ndesigned powerful war-engines capable of hurling rocks weighing three or\r\nfour hundred pounds. He knew the arts and the sciences, held lofty\r\nideals of professional conduct and dignity, and was a diligent student\r\nof Greek philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe know of him chiefly from his ten short books on Architecture (_De\r\nArchitectura, Libri Decem_), in which he touches upon much of the\r\nlearning of his time. Architecture for Vitruvius is a science arising\r\nout of many other sciences. Practice and theory are its parents. The\r\nmerely practical man loses much by not knowing the background of his\r\nactivities; the mere theorist fails by mistaking the shadow for the\r\nsubstance. Vitruvius in the theoretical and historical parts of his book\r\ndraws largely on Greek writers; but in the parts bearing on practice he\r\nsets forth, with considerable shrewdness, the outcome of years of\r\nthoughtful professional experience. One cannot read his pages without\r\nfeeling that he is more at home in the concrete than in the abstract and\r\nspeculative, in describing a catapult than in explaining a scientific\r\ntheory or a philosophy. He was not a Plato or an Archimedes, but an\r\nefficient officer of State, conscious of indebtedness to the great\r\nscientists and philosophers. With a just sense of his limitations he\r\nundertook to write, not as a literary man, but as an architect. His\r\neducation had been mainly professional, but, the whole circle of\r\nlearning being one harmonious system, he had been drawn to many branches\r\nof knowledge in so far as they were related to his calling.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of Vitruvius an architect should be a good writer, able\r\nto give a lucid explanation of his plans, a skillful draftsman, versed\r\nin geometry and optics, expert at figures, acquainted with history,\r\ninformed in the principles of physics and of ethics, knowing something\r\nof music (tones and acoustics), not ignorant of law, or of hygiene, or\r\nof the motions, laws, and relations to each other of the heavenly\r\nbodies. For, since architecture \"is founded upon and adorned with so\r\nmany different sciences, I am of opinion that those who have not, from\r\ntheir early youth, gradually climbed up to the summit, cannot without\r\npresumption, call themselves masters of it.\"\r\n\r\nVitruvius was far from sharing the view of Archimedes that art which was\r\nconnected with the satisfaction of daily needs was necessarily ignoble\r\nand vulgar. On the contrary, his interest centered in the practical; and\r\nhe was mainly concerned with scientific theory by reason of its\r\napplication in the arts. Geometry helped him plan a staircase; a\r\nknowledge of tones was necessary in discharging catapults; law dealt\r\nwith boundary-lines, sewage-disposal, and contracts; hygiene enabled the\r\narchitect to show a Hippocratic wisdom in the choice of building-sites\r\nwith due reference to airs and waters. Vitruvius had the Roman\r\npractical and regulative genius, not the abstract and speculative genius\r\nof Athens.\r\n\r\nThe second book begins with an account of different philosophical views\r\nconcerning the origin of matter, and a discussion of the earliest\r\ndwellings of man. Its real theme, however, is building-material--brick,\r\nsand, lime, stone, concrete, marble, stucco, timber, pozzolano. In\r\nreference to the last (volcanic ash combined with lime and rubble to\r\nform a cement) Vitruvius writes in a way that indicates a discriminating\r\nknowledge of geological formations. Likewise his discussion of the\r\ninfluence of the Apennines on the rainfall, and, consequently, on the\r\ntimber of the firs on the east and west of the range, shows a grasp of\r\nmeteorological principles. His real power to generalize is shown in\r\nconnection with his specialty, in his treatment of the sources of\r\nbuilding-material, rather than in his consideration of the origin of\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the fifth book begins with a discussion of the theories of\r\nPythagoras, but its real topic is public buildings--fora, basilicas,\r\ntheaters, baths, palæstras, harbors, and quays. In the theaters bronze\r\nvases of various sizes, arranged according to Pythagorean musical\r\nprinciples, were to be used in the auditorium to reinforce the voice of\r\nthe actor. (This recommendation was misunderstood centuries later, when\r\nVitruvius was considered of great authority, and led to the futile\r\npractice of placing earthenware jars beneath the floors of church\r\nchoirs.) According to our author, \"The voice arises from flowing breath,\r\nsensible to the hearing through its percussion on the air.\" It is\r\ncompared to the wavelets produced by a stone dropped in water, only that\r\nin the case of sound the waves are not confined to one plane. This\r\ngeneralization concerning the nature of sound was probably not original,\r\nhowever; it may have been suggested to Vitruvius by one of the\r\nAristotelian writings.\r\n\r\nThe seventh book treats of interior decoration--mosaic floors, gypsum\r\nmouldings, wall painting, white lead, red lead, verdigris, mercury\r\n(which may be used to recover gold from worn-out pieces of embroidery),\r\nencaustic painting with hot wax, colors (black, blue, genuine and\r\nimitation murex purple). The eighth book deals with water and with\r\nhydraulic engineering, hot springs, mineral waters, leveling\r\ninstruments, construction of aqueducts, lead and clay piping. Vitruvius\r\nwas not ignorant of the fact that water seeks its own level, and he even\r\nargued that air must have weight in order to account for the rise of\r\nwater in pumps. In his time it was more economical to convey the hard\r\nwater by aqueducts than by such pipes as could then be constructed. The\r\nninth book undertakes to rehearse the elements of geometry and\r\nastronomy--the signs of the zodiac, the sun, moon, planets, the phases\r\nof the moon, the mathematical divisions of the gnomon, the use of the\r\nsundial, etc. One feels in reading Vitruvius that his purpose was to\r\nturn to practical account what he had gained from the study of the\r\nsciences; and, at the same time, one is convinced that his applications\r\ntend to react on theoretical knowledge, and lead to new insights through\r\nthe suggestion of new problems.\r\n\r\nThe tenth book of the so-called _De Architectura_ is concerned with\r\nmachinery--windmills, windlasses, axles, pulleys, cranes, pumps,\r\nfire-engines, revolving spiral tubes for raising water, wheels for\r\nirrigation worked by water-power, wheels to register distance traveled\r\nby land or water, scaling-ladders, battering-rams, tortoises, catapults,\r\nscorpions, and ballistæ. On the subject of war-engines Vitruvius speaks\r\nwith special authority, as he had served, probably as military engineer,\r\nunder Julius Cæsar in 46 B.C., and had been appointed superintendent of\r\nballistæ and other military engines in the time of Augustus. It was to\r\nthe divine Emperor that his book was dedicated as a protest against the\r\nadministration of Roman public works. In its pages we see reflected the\r\nlife of a nation employed in conquering and ruling the world, with a\r\ngenius more distinguished for practical achievement than for theory and\r\nspeculation. Its author is truly representative of Roman culture, for\r\nnearly everything that Rome had of a scientific and intellectual sort it\r\ndrew from Greece, and it selected that part of Greek wisdom that\r\nministered to the daily needs of the times. In his work on architecture,\r\nVitruvius shows himself a diligent and devoted student of the sciences\r\nin order that he may turn them to account in his own department of\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\nIf you glance at the study of mathematics, astronomy, and medicine among\r\nthe Romans prior to the time of Greek influence, you find that next to\r\nnothing had been accomplished. Their method of field measurement was far\r\nless developed than the ancient Egyptian geometry, and even for it (as\r\nwell as for their system of numerals) they were indebted to the\r\nEtruscans. The history of astronomy has nothing to record of scientific\r\naccomplishment on the part of the Romans. They reckoned time by months,\r\nand in the earlier period kept a rude tally of the years by driving\r\nnails into a statue of Janus, the ancient sun-god. As we shall see, they\r\nwere unable to regulate the calendar. Again, so far were they from\r\ncontributing to the development of medicine that they had no physicians\r\nfor the six hundred years preceding the coming of Greek science. A\r\nmedical slave acted as overseer of the family health, and disease was\r\ncombated in primitive fashion by prayers and offerings to various gods,\r\nwho were supposed to furnish general health or to influence the\r\nfunctions of the different parts of the body. So rude was the native\r\nculture of the Romans that it is doubtful whether they had any schools\r\nbefore the advent of Greek learning. The girls were trained by their\r\nmothers, the boys either by their fathers or by some master to whom they\r\nwere apprenticed.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were conquered by the Romans in 146 B.C., but before that\r\ntime Roman life and institutions had been touched by Hellenic culture.\r\nCato the Censor (who died in 149 B.C.) and other conservatives tried in\r\nvain to resist the invasion of Greek science, philosophy, and\r\nrefinement. After the conquest of Greece the master became pupil, and\r\nthe conqueror was taken captive. The Romans, however, never rose to\r\npreëminence in science or the fine arts. A further development in\r\ntechnology corresponded more closely to their national needs, and in\r\nthis field they came undoubtedly to surpass the Greeks. Bridges, ships,\r\nmilitary roads, war-engines, aqueducts, public buildings, organization\r\nof the State and the army, the formulation of legal procedure, the\r\nenactment and codification of laws, were necessary to secure and\r\nmaintain the Empire. The use in building construction of a knowledge of\r\nthe right-angled triangle as well as other matters known to the\r\nEgyptians and Babylonians, and Archimedes' method of determining\r\nspecific gravity were of peculiar interest to the practical Romans.\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar, 102-44 B.C., instituted a reform of the calendar. This was\r\nvery much needed, as the Romans were eighty-five days out of their\r\nreckoning, and the date for the spring equinox, instead of coming at the\r\nproper time, was falling in the middle of winter. An Alexandrian\r\nastronomer (Sosigenes) assisted in establishing the new (Julian)\r\ncalendar. The principle followed was based on ancient Egyptian practice.\r\nAmong the 365 days of the year was to be inserted, or intercalated,\r\nevery fourth year an extra day. This the Romans did by giving to two\r\ndays in leap-year the same name; thus the sixth day before the first of\r\nMarch was repeated, and leap-year was known as a bissextile year. Cæsar,\r\ntrained himself in the Greek learning and known to his contemporaries as\r\na writer on mathematics and astronomy, also planned a survey of the\r\nEmpire, which was finally carried into execution by Augustus.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the need of technically trained men became more\r\nand more pressing as the Empire developed. At first there were no\r\nspecial teachers or schools. Later we find mention of teachers of\r\narchitecture and mechanics. Then the State came to provide classrooms\r\nfor technical instruction and to pay the salaries of the teachers.\r\nFinally, in the fourth century A.D., further measures were adopted by\r\nthe State. The Emperor Constantine writes to one of his officials: \"We\r\nneed as many engineers as possible. Since the supply is small, induce to\r\nbegin this study youths of about eighteen years of age who are already\r\nacquainted with the sciences required in a general education. Relieve\r\ntheir parents from the payment of taxes, and furnish the students with\r\nample means.\"\r\n\r\nPliny the Elder (23-79 A.D.), in the encyclopedic work which he compiled\r\nunder the title _Natural History_, drew freely on hundreds of Greek and\r\nLatin authors for his facts and fables. In the selection that he made\r\nfrom his sources can be traced, as in the work of Vitruvius and other\r\nLatin writers, the tendency to make the sciences subservient to the\r\narts. For example, the one thousand species of plants of which he makes\r\nmention are considered from the medicinal or from the economic point of\r\nview. It was largely in the interest of their practical uses that the\r\nRoman regarded both plants and animals; his chief motive was not a\r\ndisinterested love of truth. Pliny thought that each plant had its\r\nspecial virtue, and much of his botany is applied botany. So\r\ncomprehensive a work as the _Natural History_ was sure to contain\r\ninteresting anticipations of modern science. Pliny held that the earth\r\nhovers in the heavens upheld by the air, that its sphericity is proved\r\nby the fact that the mast of a ship approaching the land is visible\r\nbefore the hull comes in sight. He also taught that there are\r\ninhabitants on the other side of the earth (antipodes), that at the time\r\nof the winter solstice the polar night must last for twenty-four hours,\r\nand that the moon plays a part in the production of the tides.\r\nNevertheless, the whole book is permeated by the idea that the purpose\r\nof nature is to minister to the needs of man.\r\n\r\nIt further marks the practical spirit among the Romans that a work on\r\nagriculture by a Carthaginian (Mago) was translated by order of the\r\nSenate. Cato (234-149 B.C.), so characteristically Roman in his genius,\r\nwrote (_De Re Rustica_) concerning grains and the cultivation of fruits.\r\nColumella wrote treatises on agriculture and forestry. Among the\r\ntechnical writings of Varro besides the book on agriculture, which is\r\nextant, are numbered works on law, mensuration, and naval tactics.\r\n\r\nIt was but natural that at the time of the Roman Empire there should be\r\ngreat advances in medical science. A Roman's interest in a science was\r\nkeen when it could be proved to have immediate bearing on practical\r\nlife. The greatest physician of the time, however, was a Greek. Galen\r\n(131-201 A.D.), who counted himself a disciple of Hippocrates, began to\r\npractice at Rome at the age of thirty-three. He was the only\r\nexperimental physiologist before the time of Harvey. He studied the\r\nvocal apparatus in the larynx, and understood the contraction and\r\nrelaxation of the muscles, and, to a considerable extent, the motion of\r\nthe blood through the heart, lungs, and other parts of the body. He was\r\na vivisector, made sections of the brain in order to determine the\r\nfunctions of its parts, and severed the gustatory, optic, and auditory\r\nnerves with a similar end in view. His dissections were confined to the\r\nlower animals. Yet his works on human anatomy and physiology were\r\nauthoritative for the subsequent thirteen centuries. It is difficult to\r\nsay how much of the work and credit of this practical scientist is to be\r\ngiven to the race from which he sprang and how much to the social\r\nenvironment of his professional career. (In the ruins of Pompeii,\r\ndestroyed in 79 A.D., have been recovered some two hundred kinds of\r\nsurgical instrument, and in the later Empire certain departments of\r\nsurgery developed to a degree not surpassed till the sixteenth century.)\r\nIf it is too much to say that the Roman environment is responsible for\r\nGalen's achievements, we can at least say that it was characteristic\r\nof the Roman people to welcome such science as his, capable of\r\ndemonstrating its utility.\r\n\r\nDioscorides was also a Greek who, long resident at Rome, applied his\r\nscience in practice. He knew six hundred different plants, one hundred\r\nmore than Theophrastus. The latter laid much stress, as we have seen in\r\nthe preceding chapter, on the medicinal properties of plants, but in\r\nthis respect he was outdone by Dioscorides (as well as by Pliny).\r\nTheophrastus was the founder of the science of botany, Dioscorides the\r\nfounder of materia medica.\r\n\r\nQuintilian, born in Spain, spent the greater part of his life as a\r\nteacher of rhetoric in Rome. He valued the sciences, not on their own\r\naccount, but as they might subserve the purposes of the orator. Music,\r\nastronomy, logic, and even theology, might be exploited as aids to\r\npublic speech. In the time of Quintilian (first century A.D.), as in our\r\nown, oratory was considered one of the great factors in a young man's\r\nsuccess; mock debating contests were frequent, and the periods of the\r\nfuture orators reverberated among the seven hills of Rome. To him our\r\nschools are also indebted for the method of teaching foreign languages\r\nby declensions, conjugations, vocabularies, formal rhetoric and\r\nannotations. He considered ethics the most valuable part of philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it would not be pressing our argument unduly to say that, so\r\nfar as the minds of the Romans turned to speculation, it was the\r\ntendency to practical philosophy--Epicureanism or Stoicism--that was\r\nmost characteristic. This was true even of Lucretius (98-55 B.C.),\r\nauthor of the noble poem concerning the Nature of Things (_De Rerum\r\nNatura_). In this work he writes under the inspiration of Greek\r\nphilosophy. His model was a poem by Empedocles on Nature, the grand\r\nhexameters of which had fascinated the Roman poet. The distinctive\r\nfeature of the work of Lucretius is the purpose, ethical rather than\r\nspeculative, to curb the ambition, passion, luxury of those hard pagan\r\ntimes, and likewise to free the souls of his countrymen from the fear of\r\nthe gods and the fear of death, and to replace superstition by peace of\r\nmind and purity of heart.\r\n\r\nFrom the work on Physical Science (_Quæstionum Naturalium, Libri\r\nSeptem_) of Seneca, the tutor of Nero, we learn that the Romans made use\r\nof globes filled with water as magnifiers, employed hothouses in their\r\nhighly developed horticulture, and observed the refraction of colors by\r\nthe prism. At the same time the book contains interesting conjectures in\r\nreference to the relation of earthquakes and volcanoes, and to the fact\r\nthat comets travel in fixed orbits. In the main, however, this work is\r\nan attempt to find a basis for ethics in natural phenomena. Seneca was a\r\nStoic, as Lucretius was an Epicurean, moralist.\r\n\r\nWhen we glance back at the culture, or cultures, of the great peoples of\r\nantiquity, Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, and Roman, that which had its\r\ncenter on the banks of the Tiber offers the closest analogy to our own.\r\nAmong English-speaking peoples as among the Romans there is noticeable a\r\ncertain contempt for scientific studies strangely mingled with an\r\ninclination to exploit all theory in the interest of immediate\r\napplication. An English author, writing in 1834, remarks that the\r\nRomans, eminent in war, in polite literature, and civil policy, showed\r\nat all times a remarkable indisposition to the pursuit of mathematical\r\nand physical science. Geometry and astronomy, so highly esteemed by the\r\nGreeks, were not merely disregarded by the Italians, but even considered\r\nbeneath the attention of a man of good birth and liberal education; they\r\nwere imagined to partake of a mechanical, and therefore servile,\r\ncharacter. \"The results were seen to be made use of by the mechanical\r\nartist, and the abstract principles were therefore supposed to be, as it\r\nwere, contaminated by his touch. This unfortunate peculiarity in the\r\ntaste of his countrymen is remarked by Cicero. And it may not be\r\nirrelevant to inquire, whether similar prejudices do not prevail to some\r\nextent even among ourselves.\" To Americans also must be attributed an\r\nimpatience of theory as theory, and a predominant interest in the\r\napplications of science.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Lucretius, _The Nature of Things_; translated by H.

By the written sign or spoken word it is transmitted\r\nfrom one person to another. Very little advance in culture could be made\r\neven by the greatest man of genius if he were dependent, for what\r\nknowledge he might acquire, merely on his own personal observation.\r\nIndeed, it might be said that exceptional mental ability involves a\r\npower to absorb the ideas of others, and even that the most original\r\npeople are those who are able to borrow the most freely.\r\n\r\nIn recalling the lives of certain great men we may at first be inclined\r\nto doubt this truth. How shall we account for the part played in the\r\nprogress of civilization by the rustic Burns, the village-bred\r\nShakespeare, or by Lincoln the frontiersman? When, however, we\r\nscrutinize the case of any one of these, we discover, of course,\r\nexceptional natural endowment, susceptibility to mental influence,\r\nremarkable powers of acquisition, but no ability to produce anything\r\nabsolutely original. In the case of Lincoln, for example, we find that\r\nin his youth he was as distinguished by diligence in study as by\r\nphysical stature and prowess. After he withdrew from school, he read,\r\nwrote, and ciphered (in the intervals of manual work) almost\r\nincessantly. He read everything he could lay hands on. He copied out\r\nwhat most appealed to him. A few books he read and re-read till he had\r\nalmost memorized them. What constituted his library? The Bible, _Æsop's\r\nFables_, _Robinson Crusoe_, _The Pilgrim's Progress_, a _Life of\r\nWashington_, a _History of the United States_. These established for him\r\na vital relation with the past, and laid the foundations of a democratic\r\nculture; not the culture of a Chesterfield, to be sure, but something\r\nimmeasurably better, and none the less good for being almost universally\r\naccessible. Lincoln developed his logical powers conning the dictionary.\r\nLong before he undertook the regular study of the law, he spent long\r\nhours poring over the revised statutes of the State in which he was\r\nliving. From a book he mastered with a purpose the principles of\r\ngrammar. In the same spirit he learned surveying, also by means of a\r\nbook. There is no need to ignore any of the influences that told\r\ntoward the development of this great statesman, the greatest of\r\nEnglish-speaking orators, but it is evident that remote as was his\r\nhabitation from all the famous centers of learning he was, nevertheless,\r\nearly immersed in the current of the world's best thought.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the history of science, every great thinker has his\r\nintellectual pedigree. Aristotle was the pupil of Plato, Plato was the\r\ndisciple of Socrates, and the latter's intellectual genealogy in turn\r\ncan readily be traced to Thales, and beyond--to Egyptian priests and\r\nBabylonian astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe city of Alexandria, founded by the pupil of Aristotle in 332 B.C.,\r\nsucceeded Athens as the center of Greek culture. On the death of\r\nAlexander the Great, Egypt was ruled by one of his generals, Ptolemy,\r\nwho assumed the title of king. This monarch, though often engaged in\r\nwar, found time to encourage learning, and drew to his capital scholars\r\nand philosophers from Greece and other countries. He wrote himself a\r\nhistory of Alexander's campaigns, and instituted the famous library of\r\nAlexandria. This was greatly developed (and supplemented with schools of\r\nscience and an observatory) by his son Ptolemy Philadelphus, a prince\r\ndistinguished by his zeal in promoting the good of the human species. He\r\ncollected vast numbers of manuscripts, had strange animals brought from\r\ndistant lands to Alexandria, and otherwise promoted scientific research.\r\nThis movement was continued under Ptolemy III (246-221 B.C.).\r\n\r\nSomething has already been said of the early astronomers and\r\nmathematicians of Alexandria. The scientific movement of the later\r\nAlexandrian period found its consummation in the geographer, astronomer,\r\nand mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (not to be confused with the rulers\r\nof that name). He was most active 127-151 A.D., and is best known by his\r\nwork the _Syntaxis_, which summarized what was known in astronomy at\r\nthat time. Ptolemy drew up a catalogue of 1080 stars based on the\r\nearlier work of Hipparchus. He followed that astronomer in teaching that\r\nthe earth is the center of the movement of the heavenly bodies, and this\r\ngeocentric system of the heavens became known as the Ptolemaic system of\r\nastronomy. To Hipparchus and Ptolemy we owe also the beginnings of the\r\nscience of trigonometry. The _Syntaxis_ sets forth his method of\r\ndrawing up a table of chords. For example, the side of a hexagon\r\ninscribed in a circle is equal to the radius, and is the chord of 60°,\r\nor of the sixth part of the circle. The radius is divided into sixty\r\nequal parts, and these again divided and subdivided sexagesimally. The\r\nsmaller divisions and the subdivisions are known as prime minute parts\r\nand second minute parts (_partes minutæ primæ_ and _partes minutæ\r\nsecundæ_), whence our terms \"minute\" and \"second.\" The sexagesimal\r\nmethod of dividing the circle and its parts was, as we have seen in the\r\nfirst chapter, of Babylonian origin.\r\n\r\nPtolemy was the last of the great Greek astronomers. In the fourth\r\ncentury and at the beginning of the fifth, Theon and his illustrious\r\ndaughter Hypatia commented on and taught the astronomy of Ptolemy. In\r\nthe Greek schools of philosophy Plato's doctrine of the supreme reality\r\nof the invisible world was harmonized for a time with Christian\r\nmysticism, but these schools were suppressed at the beginning of the\r\nsixth century. The extinction of scientific and of all other learning\r\nseemed imminent.\r\n\r\nWhat were the causes of this threatened break in the historical\r\ncontinuity of science? They were too many and too varied to admit of\r\nadequate statement here. From the latter part of the fourth century the\r\nRoman Empire had been overrun by the Visigoths, the Vandals, the Huns,\r\nthe Ostrogoths, the Lombards, and other barbarians. Even before these\r\nincursions learning had suffered under the calamity of war. In the time\r\nof Julius Cæsar the larger of the famous libraries of Alexandria,\r\ncontaining, it is computed, some 490,000 rolls, caught fire from ships\r\nburning in the harbor, and perished. This alone involved an incalculable\r\nsetback to the march of scientific thought.\r\n\r\nAnother influence tending to check the advance of the sciences was the\r\nclash between Christian and Pagan ideals. To many of the bishops of the\r\nChurch the aims and pursuits of science seemed vain and trivial when\r\ncompared with the preservation of purity of character or the assurance\r\nof eternal felicity. Many were convinced that the end of the world was\r\nat hand, and strove to fix their thoughts solely on the world to come.\r\nTheir austere disregard of this life found some support in a noble\r\nteaching of the Stoic philosophy that death itself is no evil to the\r\njust man. The early Christian teachers held that the body should be\r\nmortified if it interfered with spiritual welfare. Disease is a\r\npunishment, or a discipline to be patiently borne. One should choose\r\nphysical uncleanliness rather than run any risk of moral contamination.\r\nIt is not impossible for enlightened people at the present time\r\nto assume a tolerant attitude toward the worldly Greeks or the\r\nother-worldly Christians. At that time, however, mutual antipathy was\r\nintense. The long and cruel war between science and Christian theology\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nNot all the Christian bishops, to be sure, took a hostile view of Greek\r\nlearning. Some regarded the great philosophers as the allies of the\r\nChurch. Some held that churchmen should study the wisdom of the Greeks\r\nin order the better to refute them. Others held that the investigation\r\nof truth was no longer necessary after mankind had received the\r\nrevelation of the gospel. One of the ablest of the Church Fathers\r\nregretted his early education and said that it would have been better\r\nfor him if he had never heard of Democritus. The Christian writer\r\nLactantius asked shrewdly whence atoms came, and what proof there was of\r\ntheir existence. He also allowed himself to ridicule the idea of the\r\nantipodes, a topsy-turvy world of unimaginable disorder. In 389 A.D. one\r\nof the libraries at Alexandria was destroyed and its books were pillaged\r\nby the Christians. In 415 Hypatia, Greek philosopher and mathematician,\r\nwas murdered by a Christian mob. In 642 the Arabs having pushed their\r\nconquest into northern Africa gained possession of Alexandria. The cause\r\nof learning seemed finally and irrecoverably lost.\r\n\r\nThe Arab conquerors, however, showed themselves singularly hospitable to\r\nthe culture of the nations over which they had gained control. Since the\r\ntime of Alexander there had been many Greek settlers in the larger\r\ncities of Syria and Persia, and here learning had been maintained in the\r\nschools of the Jews and of a sect of Christians (Nestorians), who were\r\nparticularly active as educators from the fifth century to the eleventh.\r\nThe principal Greek works on science had been translated into Syrian.\r\nHindu arithmetic and astronomy had found their way into Persia. By the\r\nninth century all these sources of scientific knowledge had been\r\nappropriated by the Arabs. Some fanatics among them, to be sure, held\r\nthat one book, the Koran, was of itself sufficient to insure the\r\nwell-being of the whole human race, but happily a more enlightened view\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Harun Al-Rashid (800 A.D.), and his son, the Caliphate\r\nof Bagdad was the center of Arab science. Mathematics and astronomy were\r\nespecially cultivated; an observatory was established; and the work of\r\ntranslation was systematically carried on by a sort of institute of\r\ntranslators, who rendered the writings of Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen,\r\nEuclid, Ptolemy, and other Greek scientists, into Arabic. The names of\r\nthe great Arab astronomers and mathematicians are not popularly known to\r\nus; their influence is greater than their fame. One of them describes\r\nthe method pursued by him in the ninth century in taking measure of the\r\ncircumference of the earth. A second developed a trigonometry of sines\r\nto replace the Ptolemaic trigonometry of chords. A third made use of the\r\nso-called Arabic (really Hindu) system of numerals, and wrote the first\r\nwork on Algebra under that name. In this the writer did not aim at the\r\nmental discipline of students, but sought to confine himself to what is\r\neasiest and most useful in calculation, \"such as men constantly require\r\nin cases of inheritance, legacies, partition, law-suits, and trade, and\r\nin all their dealings with one another, or where the measuring of lands,\r\nthe digging of canals, geometrical computation, and other objects of\r\nvarious sorts and kinds are concerned.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following centuries Arab institutions of higher learning were\r\nwidely distributed and the flood-tide of Arab science was borne farther\r\nwest. At Cairo about the close of the tenth century the first accurate\r\nrecords of eclipses were made, and tables were constructed of the\r\nmotions of the sun, moon, and planets. Here as elsewhere the Arabs\r\ndisplayed ingenuity in the making of scientific apparatus, celestial\r\nglobes, sextants of large size, quadrants of various sorts, and\r\ncontrivances from which in the course of time were developed modern\r\nsurveying instruments for measuring horizontal and vertical angles.\r\nBefore the end of the eleventh century an Arab born at Cordova, the\r\ncapital of Moorish Spain, constructed the Toletan Tables. These were\r\nfollowed in 1252 by the publication of the Alphonsine Tables, an event\r\nwhich astronomers regard as marking the dawn of European science.\r\n\r\nPhysics and chemistry, as well as mathematics and astronomy, owe much in\r\ntheir development to the Arabs. An Arabian scientist of the eleventh\r\ncentury studied the phenomena of the reflection and refraction of light,\r\nexplained the causes of morning and evening twilight, understood the\r\nmagnifying power of lenses and the anatomy of the human eye. Our use of\r\nthe terms retina, cornea, and vitreous humor may be traced to\r\nthe translation of his work on optics. The Arabs also made fair\r\napproximations to the correct specific weights of gold, copper, mercury,\r\nand lead. Their alchemy was closely associated with metallurgy, the\r\nmaking of alloys and amalgams, and the handicrafts of the goldsmiths and\r\nsilversmiths. The alchemists sought to discover processes whereby one\r\nmetal might be transmuted into another. Sulphur affected the color and\r\nsubstance. Mercury was supposed to play an important part in metal\r\ntransmutations. They thought, for example, that tin contained more\r\nmercury than lead, and that the baser, more unhealthy metal might be\r\nconverted into the nobler and more healthy by the addition of mercury.\r\nThey even sought for a substance that might effect all transmutations,\r\nand be for mankind a cure for all ailments, even that of growing old.\r\nThe writings that have been attributed to Geber show the advances that\r\nchemistry made through the experiments of the Arabs. They produced\r\nsulphuric and nitric acids, and _aqua regia_, able to dissolve gold, the\r\nking of metals. They could make use of wet methods, and form metallic\r\nsalts such as silver nitrate. Laboratory processes like distilling,\r\nfiltering, crystallization, sublimation, became known to the Europeans\r\nthrough them. They obtained potash from wine lees, soda from sea-plants,\r\nand from quicksilver the mercuric oxide which played so interesting a\r\npart in the later history of chemistry.\r\n\r\nMuch of the science lore of the Arabs arose from their extensive trade,\r\nand in the practice of medicine. They introduced sugar-cane into Europe,\r\nimproved the methods of manufacturing paper, discovered a method of\r\nobtaining alcohol, knew the uses of gypsum and of white arsenic, were\r\nexpert in pharmacy and learned in materia medica. They are sometimes\r\ncredited with introducing to the West the knowledge of the mariner's\r\ncompass and of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nAvicenna (980-1037), the Arab physician, not only wrote a large work on\r\nmedicine (the _Canon_) based on the lore of Galen, which was used as a\r\ntext-book for centuries in the universities of Europe, but wrote\r\ncommentaries on all the works of Aristotle. For Averroës (1126-1198),\r\nthe Arab physician and philosopher, was reserved the title \"The\r\nCommentator,\" due to his devotion to the works of the Greek biologist\r\nand philosopher. It was through the commentaries of Averroës that\r\nAristotelian science became known in Europe during the Middle Ages. In\r\nhis view Aristotle was the founder and perfecter of science; yet he\r\nshowed an independent knowledge of physics and chemistry, and wrote on\r\nastronomy and medicine as well as philosophy. He set forth the facts in\r\nreference to natural phenomena purely in the interests of the truth. He\r\ncould not conceive of anything being created from nothing. At the same\r\ntime he taught that God is the essence, the eternal cause, of progress.\r\nIt is in humanity that intellect most clearly reveals itself, but there\r\nis a transcendent intellect beyond, union with which is the highest\r\nbliss of the individual soul. With the death of the Commentator the\r\nculture of liberal science among the Arabs came to an end, but his\r\ninfluence (and through him that of Aristotle) was perpetuated in all the\r\nwestern centers of education.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the ancient learning had not, however, depended\r\nsolely on the Arabs. At the beginning of the sixth century, before the\r\ntaking of Alexandria by the followers of Mohammed, St. Benedict had\r\nfounded the monastery of Monte Cassino in Italy. Here was begun the\r\ncopying of manuscripts, and the preparation of compendiums treating of\r\ngrammar, dialectic, rhetoric, arithmetic, astronomy, music, and\r\ngeometry. These were based on ancient, Roman writings. Works like\r\nPliny's _Natural History_, the encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, had\r\nsurvived all the wars by which Rome had been devastated. Learning, which\r\nin Rome's darkest days had found refuge in Britain and Ireland, returned\r\nbook in hand. Charlemagne (800) called Alcuin from York to instruct\r\nprinces and nobles at the Frankish court. At this same palace school\r\nhalf a century later the Irishman Scotus Erigena exhibited his learning,\r\nwit, and logical acumen. In the tenth century Gerbert (Pope Sylvester\r\nII) learned mathematics at Arab schools in Spain. The translation of\r\nArab works on science into the Latin language, freer intercourse of\r\nEuropean peoples with the East through war and trade, economic\r\nprosperity, the liberation of serfs and the development of a well-to-do\r\nmiddle class, the voyages of Marco Polo to the Orient, the founding of\r\nuniversities, the encouragement of learning by the Emperor Frederick II,\r\nthe study of logic by the schoolmen, were all indicative of a new era in\r\nthe history of scientific thought.\r\n\r\nThe learned Dominican Albertus Magnus (1193-1280) was a careful student\r\nof Aristotle as well as of his Arabian commentators. In his many books\r\non natural history he of course pays great deference to the Philosopher,\r\nbut he is not devoid of original observation. As the official visitor of\r\nhis order he had traveled through the greater part of Germany on foot,\r\nand with a keen eye for natural phenomena was able to enrich botany and\r\nzoölogy by much accurate information. His intimacy with the details of\r\nnatural history made him suspected by the ignorant of the practice of\r\nmagical arts.\r\n\r\nHis pupil and disciple Thomas Aquinas (1227-1274) was the philosopher\r\nand recognized champion of the Christian Church. In 1879 Pope Leo XIII,\r\nwhile proclaiming that every wise saying, every useful discovery, by\r\nwhomsoever it may be wrought, should be welcomed with a willing and\r\ngrateful mind, exhorted the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church to\r\nrestore the golden wisdom of St. Thomas and to propagate it as widely as\r\npossible for the good of society and the advancement of all the\r\nsciences. Certainly the genius of St. Thomas Aquinas seems comprehensive\r\nenough to embrace all science as well as all philosophy from the\r\nChristian point of view. According to him there are two sources of\r\nknowledge, reason and revelation. These are not irreconcilably opposed.\r\nThe Greek philosophers speak with the voice of reason. It is the duty of\r\ntheology to bring all knowledge into harmony with the truths of\r\nrevelation imparted by God for the salvation of the human race. Averroës\r\nis in error when he argues the impossibility of something being created\r\nfrom nothing, and again when he implies that the individual intellect\r\nbecomes merged in a transcendental intellect; for such teaching would be\r\nthe contrary of what has been revealed in reference to the creation of\r\nthe world and the immortality of the individual soul. In the\r\naccompanying illustration we see St. Thomas inspired by Christ in glory,\r\nguided by Moses, St. Peter, and the Evangelists, and instructed by\r\nAristotle and Plato. He has overcome the heathen philosopher Averroës,\r\nwho lies below discomfited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. THOMAS AQUINAS OVERCOMING AVERROËS]\r\n\r\nThe English Franciscan Roger Bacon (1214-1294) deserves to be mentioned\r\nwith the two great Dominicans. He was acquainted with the works of the\r\nGreek and Arabian scientists. He transmitted in a treatise that fell\r\nunder the eye of Columbus the view of Aristotle in reference to the\r\nproximity of another continent on the other side of the Atlantic; he\r\nanticipated the principle on which the telescope was afterwards\r\nconstructed; he advocated basing natural science on experience and\r\ncareful observation rather than on a process of reasoning. Roger Bacon's\r\nwritings are characterized by a philosophical breadth of view. To his\r\nmind the earth is only an insignificant dot in the center of the vast\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nIn the centuries that followed the death of Bacon the relation of this\r\nplanet to the heavenly bodies was made an object of study by a\r\nsuccession of scientists who like him were versed in the achievements of\r\npreceding ages. Peurbach (1423-1461), author of _New Theories of the\r\nPlanets_, developed the trigonometry of the Arabians, but died before\r\nfulfilling his plan to give Europe an epitome of the astronomy of\r\nPtolemy. His pupil, Regiomontanus, however, more than made good the\r\nintentions of his master. The work of Peurbach had as commentator the\r\nfirst teacher in astronomy of Copernicus (1473-1543). Later Copernicus\r\nspent nine years in Italy, studying at the universities and acquainting\r\nhimself with Ptolemaic and other ancient views concerning the motions of\r\nthe planets. He came to see that the apparent revolution of the heavenly\r\nbodies about the earth from east to west is really owing to the\r\nrevolution of the earth on its axis from west to east. This view was so\r\ncontrary to prevailing beliefs that Copernicus refused to publish his\r\ntheory for thirty-six years. A copy of his book, teaching that our earth\r\nis not the center of the universe, was brought to him on his deathbed,\r\nbut he never opened it.\r\n\r\nMomentous as was this discovery, setting aside the geocentric system\r\nwhich had held captive the best minds for fourteen slow centuries and\r\nsubstituting the heliocentric, it was but a link in the chain of\r\nsuccesses in astronomy to which Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, Newton,\r\nand their followers contributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n _The Catholic Encyclopedia._\r\n\r\n J.

The astronomy, or the chemistry, or the\r\nmathematics, of one period depends so directly on the respective science\r\nof the foregoing period, that one feels justified in using the term\r\n\"growth,\" or \"evolution,\" to describe their progress. Now a vital\r\nrelationship can be observed not only among different stages of the same\r\nscience, but also among the different sciences. Physics, astronomy, and\r\nchemistry have much in common; geometry, trigonometry, arithmetic, and\r\nalgebra are called \"branches\" of mathematics; zoölogy and botany are\r\nbiological sciences, as having to do with living species. In the century\r\nfollowing the death of Copernicus, two great scientists, Bacon and\r\nDescartes, compared all knowledge to a tree, of which the separate\r\nsciences are branches. They thought of all knowledge as a living\r\norganism with an interconnection or continuity of parts, and a\r\ncapability of growth.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the sciences were so\r\nconsiderable that in the interest of further progress a comprehensive\r\nview of the tree of knowledge, a survey of the field of learning, was\r\nneeded. The task of making this survey was undertaken by Francis Bacon,\r\nLord Verulam (1561-1626). His classification of human knowledge was\r\ncelebrated, and very influential in the progress of science. He kept one\r\nclear purpose in view, namely, the control of nature by man. He wished\r\nto take stock of what had already been accomplished, to supply\r\ndeficiencies, and to enlarge the bounds of human empire. He was acutely\r\nconscious that this was an enterprise too great for any one man, and he\r\nused his utmost endeavors to induce James I to become the patron of the\r\nplan. His project admits of very simple statement now; he wished to edit\r\nan encyclopedia, but feared that it might prove impossible without\r\ncoöperation and without state support. He felt capable of furnishing the\r\nplans for the building, but thought it a hardship that he was compelled\r\nto serve both as architect and laborer. The worthiness of these plans\r\nwas attested in the middle of the eighteenth century, when the great\r\nFrench _Encyclopaedia_ was projected by Diderot and D'Alembert. The\r\nformer, its chief editor and contributor, wrote in the Prospectus: \"If\r\nwe come out successful from this vast undertaking, we shall owe it\r\nmainly to Chancellor Bacon, who sketched the plan of a universal\r\ndictionary of sciences and arts at a time when there were not, so to\r\nspeak, either arts or sciences. This extraordinary genius, when it was\r\nimpossible to write a history of what men knew, wrote one of what they\r\nhad to learn.\"\r\n\r\nBacon, as we shall amply see, was a firm believer in the study\r\nof the arts and occupations, and at the same time retained his\r\ndevotion to principles and abstract thought. He knew that philosophy\r\ncould aid the arts that supply daily needs; also that the arts and\r\noccupations enriched the field of philosophy, and that the basis of our\r\ngeneralizations must be the universe of things knowable. \"For,\" he\r\nwrites, \"if men judge that learning should be referred to use and\r\naction, they judge well; but it is easy in this to fall into the error\r\npointed out in the ancient fable; in which the other parts of the body\r\nfound fault with the stomach, because it neither performed the office of\r\nmotion as the limbs do, nor of sense, as the head does; but yet\r\nnotwithstanding it is the stomach which digests and distributes the\r\naliment to all the rest. So that if any man think that philosophy and\r\nuniversality are idle and unprofitable studies, he does not consider\r\nthat all arts and professions are from thence supplied with sap and\r\nstrength.\" For Bacon, as for Descartes, natural philosophy was the trunk\r\nof the tree of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n Human Learning (Bacon's Classification)\r\n\r\n Column Key:\r\n (A) Reason Philosophy, or the Sciences\r\n (B) Imagination Poesy\r\n (C) Memory History\r\n\r\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                    Philosophia prima, or sapience\r\n -----+---+--------+----------------------+---------------------------------\r\n  (A) |   |        | Civil Philosophy     | Intercourse\r\n      | N |        | (Standards of        | Business\r\n      | a |        |  right in:)          | Government\r\n      | t | Man    +---------------+------+---------------------------------\r\n      | u |        | Philosophy    | Body | Medicine, Athletics, etc.\r\n      | r |        | of Humanity   +------+---------------------------------\r\n      | a |        | (Anthropology)|      | Logic\r\n      | l |        |               | Soul |\r\n      |   |        |               |      | Ethics\r\n      | P +--------+-------------+-+------+--------+----------+-------------\r\n      | h |        |             | Physics         | Concrete |\r\n      | i |        |             | (Material and   |          |  M\r\n      | l |        |             |  Secondary      | Abstract |  a\r\n      | o |        |             |  Causes)        |          |  t\r\n      | s | Nature | Speculative |                 |          |  h\r\n      | o |        |             | Metaphysics     | Concrete |  e\r\n      | p |        |             | (Form and Final |          |  m\r\n      | h |        |             |  Causes)        | Abstract |  a\r\n      | y |        +-------------+-----------------+----------+  t\r\n      |   |        |             | Mechanics                  |  i\r\n      |   |        | Operative   |                            |  c\r\n      |   |        |             | Purified Magic             |  s\r\n      |   +--------+-------------+----------------------------+-------------\r\n      |   | God    | Natural Theology, Nature of Angels and Spirits\r\n      +---+--------+--------------------------------------------------------\r\n      | Divinity   | Revelation\r\n -----+------------+--------------------------------------------------------\r\n  (B) | Narrative, or Heroical\r\n      | Dramatic\r\n      | Parabolic (Fables)\r\n -----+-----------+------------------------+--------------------------------\r\n  (C) |           | Political              | Memorials\r\n      | Civil     | (Civil History proper) | Antiquities\r\n      |           |                        | Perfect History\r\n      |           +-----------+------------+--------------------------------\r\n      |           |           | Learning\r\n      |           | Literary  |\r\n      |           |           | Arts\r\n      |           +-----------+---------------------------------------------\r\n      |           | Ecclesiastical\r\n      +-----------+-------------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n      |           | Bonds             | Arts              | Mechanical\r\n      |           |  (Control by Man) |                   | Experimental\r\n      |           +-------------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n      |           | Errors            | Pretergenerations\r\n      | Natural   |  (Anomics)        |  (Monsters)\r\n      |           +-------------------+---------------+---------------------\r\n      |           | Freedom           | Generations   | Astronomical Physics\r\n      |           |  (Nomic Law)      |               | Physical Geography\r\n      |           |                   |               | Physics of Matter\r\n      |           |                   |               | Organic Species\r\n -----+-----------+-------------------+---------------+---------------------\r\n\r\n ------------+----------------------------------------------------\r\n             | Knowledge Classified (Hugo of St. Victor, d. 1141).\r\n ------------+---------------------+------------------------------\r\n Theoretical | Theology            |\r\n             | Natural Philosophy  |\r\n             |    (Physic)         |\r\n ------------+---------------------+------------------------------\r\n             | Mathematics         | Arithmetic\r\n             |                     | Music (study of harmony)\r\n             |                     | Geometry\r\n             |                     | Astronomy\r\n ------------+---------------------+------------------------------\r\n Practical   | Ethics, or individual morality\r\n  (Moral)    | Economics, or family morality\r\n             | Politics, or civics\r\n ------------+----------------------------------------------------\r\n Mechanical  | Weaving, spinning, sewing;

In his survey of learning he found some\r\nrecords of agriculture and likewise of many mechanical arts. Some think\r\nthem a kind of dishonor. \"But if my judgment be of any weight, the use\r\nof History Mechanical is, of all others, the most radical and\r\nfundamental towards natural philosophy.\" When the different arts are\r\nknown, the senses will furnish sufficient concrete material for the\r\ninformation of the understanding. The record of the arts is of most use\r\nbecause it exhibits things in motion, and leads more directly to\r\npractice. \"Upon this history, therefore, mechanical and illiberal as it\r\nmay seem (all fineness and daintiness set aside), the greatest diligence\r\nmust be bestowed.\" \"Again, among the particular arts those are to be\r\npreferred which exhibit, alter, and prepare natural bodies and\r\nmaterials of things as agriculture, cooking, chemistry, dyeing; the\r\nmanufacture of glass, enamel, sugar, gunpowder, artificial fires, paper\r\nand the like.\" Weaving, carpentry, architecture, manufacture of mills,\r\nclocks, etc. follow. The purpose is not solely to bring the arts to\r\nperfection, but all mechanical experiments should be as streams flowing\r\nfrom all sides into the sea of philosophy.\r\n\r\nShortly after James I came to the throne in 1603, Bacon published his\r\n_Advancement of Learning_. He continued in other writings, however, to\r\ndevelop the organization of knowledge, and in 1623 summed up his plan in\r\nthe _De Augmentis Scientiarum_.\r\n\r\nA recent writer (Pearson, 1900) has attempted to summarize Bacon's\r\nclassification of the different branches of learning. When one compares\r\nthis summary with an outline of the classification of knowledge made by\r\nthe French monk, Hugo of St. Victor, who stands midway between Isidore\r\nof Seville (570-636) and Bacon, some points of resemblance are of course\r\nobvious. Moreover, Hugo, like Bacon, insisted on the importance of not\r\nbeing narrowly utilitarian. Men, he says, are often accustomed to value\r\nknowledge not on its own account but for what it yields. Thus it is with\r\nthe arts of husbandry, weaving, painting, and the like, where skill is\r\nconsidered absolutely vain, unless it results in some useful product.\r\nIf, however, we judged after this fashion of God's wisdom, then, no\r\ndoubt, the creation would be preferred to the Creator. But wisdom is\r\nlife, and the love of wisdom is the joy of life (_felicitas vitæ_).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when we compare these classifications diligently, we find\r\nvery marked differences between Bacon's views and the medieval. The\r\nweakest part of Hugo's classification is that which deals with natural\r\nphilosophy. _Physica_, he says, undertakes the investigation of the\r\ncauses of things in their effects, and of effects in their causes. It\r\ndeals with the explanation of earthquakes, tides, the virtues of plants,\r\nthe fierce instincts of wild animals, every species of stone, shrub, and\r\nreptile. When we turn to his special work, however, on this branch of\r\nknowledge, _Concerning Beasts and Other Things_, we find no attempt to\r\nsubdivide the field of _physica_, but a series of details in botany,\r\ngeology, zoölogy, and human anatomy, mostly arranged in dictionary form.\r\n\r\nWhen we refer to Bacon's classification we find that Physics corresponds\r\nto Hugo's _Physica_. It studies natural phenomena in relation to their\r\nmaterial causes. For this study, Natural History, according to Bacon,\r\nsupplies the facts. Let us glance, then, at his work on natural history,\r\nand see how far he had advanced from the medieval toward the modern\r\nconception of the sciences.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of scientific study he divided the phenomena of the\r\nuniverse into (1) Celestial phenomena; (2) Atmosphere; (3) Globe; (4)\r\nSubstance of earth, air, fire, water; (5) Genera, species, etc. Great\r\nscope is given to the natural history of man. The arts are classified as\r\n_nature modified by man_. _History_ means, of course, descriptive\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bacon's Catalogue of Particular Histories by Titles (1620)_\r\n\r\n   1.

Besides completing his survey and classification of the sciences\r\n(_De Augmentis Scientiarum_), 1623, he published a few separate writings\r\non topics in the catalogue--_Winds_, _Life and Death_, _Tides_, etc. In\r\n1627, a year after his death, appeared his much misunderstood work,\r\n_Sylva Sylvarum_. He had found that the Latin word _sylva_ meant _stuff_\r\nor _raw material_, as well as a _wood_, and called this final work\r\n_Sylva Sylvarum_, which I would translate, \"Jungle of Raw Material.\" He\r\nhimself referred to it as \"an undigested heap of particulars\"; yet he\r\nwas willing it should be published because \"he preferred the good of men\r\nto anything that might have relation to himself.\" In it, following his\r\ncatalogue, he fulfilled the promise made in 1620, of putting nature and\r\nthe arts to question. Some of the problems suggested for investigation\r\nare: congealing of air, turning air into water, the secret nature of\r\nflame, motion of gravity, production of cold, nourishing of young\r\ncreatures in the egg or womb, prolongation of life, the media of sound,\r\ninfectious diseases, accelerating and preventing putrefaction,\r\naccelerating and staying growth, producing fruit without core or seed,\r\nproduction of composts and helps for ground, flying in the air.\r\n\r\nIn the _New Atlantis_, a work of imagination, Bacon had represented as\r\nalready achieved for mankind some of the benefits he wished for:\r\nartificial metals, various cements, excellent dyes, animals for\r\nvivisection and medical experiment, instruments which generate heat\r\nsolely by motion, artificial precious stones, conveyance of sound for\r\ngreat distances and in tortuous lines, new explosives. \"We imitate,\"\r\nsays the guide in the Utopian land, \"also flights of birds; we have some\r\ndegree of flying in the air; we have ships and boats for going under\r\nwater.\" Bacon believed in honoring the great discoverers and inventors,\r\nand advocated maintaining a calendar of inventions.\r\n\r\nHe was a fertile and stimulating thinker, and much of his great\r\ninfluence arose from the comprehensiveness that led to his celebrated\r\nclassification of the sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Bacon's _Philosophical Works_, vol.

The same period\r\nwitnessed a conscious development of the method, or methods, of\r\ninvestigation. As we have seen, Bacon wrote in 1620 a considerable work,\r\n_The New Logic_ (_Novum Organum_), so called to distinguish it from the\r\ntraditional deductive logic. It aimed to furnish the organ or\r\ninstrument, to indicate the correct mental procedure, to be employed in\r\nthe discovery of natural law. Some seventeen years later, the\r\nillustrious Frenchman René Descartes (1596-1650) published his\r\n_Discourse on the Method of rightly conducting the Reason and seeking\r\nTruth in the Sciences_. Both of these philosophers illustrated by their\r\nown investigations the efficiency of the methods which they advocated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Painting by A. Ackland Hunt_\r\n\r\nDR. GILBERT SHOWING HIS ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS TO QUEEN ELIZABETH AND\r\nHER COURT]\r\n\r\nBefore 1620, however, the experimental method had already yielded\r\nbrilliant results in the hands of other scientists. We pass over\r\nLeonardo da Vinci and many others in Italy and elsewhere, whose names\r\nshould be mentioned if we were tracing this method to its origin. By\r\n1600 William Gilbert (1540-1603), physician to Queen Elizabeth, before\r\nwhom, as a picture in his birthplace illustrates, he was called to\r\ndemonstrate his discoveries, had published his work on the Magnet, the\r\noutcome of about eighteen years of critical research. He may be\r\nconsidered the founder of electrical science. Galileo, who discovered\r\nthe fundamental principles of dynamics and thus laid the basis of modern\r\nphysical science, although he did not publish his most important work\r\ntill 1638, had even before the close of the sixteenth century prepared\r\nthe way for the announcement of his principles by years of strict\r\nexperiment. By the year 1616, William Harvey (1578-1657), physician at\r\nthe court of James I, and, later, of Charles I, had, as the first modern\r\nexperimental physiologist, gained important results through his study of\r\nthe circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nIt is not without significance that both Gilbert and Harvey had spent\r\nyears in Italy, where, as we have implied, the experimental method of\r\nscientific research was early developed. Harvey was at Padua (1598-1602)\r\nwithin the time of Galileo's popular professoriate, and may well have\r\nbeen inspired by the physicist to explain on dynamical principles the\r\nflow of blood through arteries and veins. This conjecture is the more\r\nprobable, since Galileo, like Harvey and Gilbert, had been trained in\r\nthe study of medicine. Bacon in turn had in his youth learned something\r\nof the experimental method on the Continent of Europe, and, later, was\r\nwell aware of the studies of Gilbert and Galileo, as well as of Harvey,\r\nwho was indeed his personal physician.\r\n\r\nAlthough these facts seem to indicate that method may be transmitted in\r\na nation or a profession, or through personal association, there still\r\nremains some doubt as to whether anything so intimate as the mental\r\nprocedure involved in invention and in the discovery of truth can be\r\nsuccessfully imparted by instruction. The individuality of the man of\r\ngenius engaged in investigation must remain a factor difficult to\r\nanalyze. Bacon, whose purpose was to hasten man's empire over nature\r\nthrough increasing the number of inventions and discoveries, recognized\r\nthat the method he illustrated is not the sole method of scientific\r\ninvestigation. In fact, he definitely states that the method set forth\r\nin the _Novum Organum_ is not original, or perfect, or indispensable. He\r\nwas aware that his method tended to the ignoring of genius and to the\r\nputting of intelligences on one level. He knew that, although it is\r\ndesirable for the investigator to free his mind from prepossessions, and\r\nto avoid premature generalizations, interpretation is the true and\r\nnatural work of the mind when free from impediments, and that the\r\nconjecture of the man of genius must at times anticipate the slow\r\nprocess of painful induction. As we shall see in the nineteenth chapter,\r\nthe psychology of to-day does not know enough about the workings of the\r\nmind to prescribe a fixed mental attitude for the investigator.\r\nNevertheless, Bacon was not wrong in pointing out the virtues of a\r\nmethod which he and many others turned to good account. Let us first\r\nglance, however, at the activities of those scientists who preceded\r\nBacon in the employment of the experimental method.\r\n\r\nGilbert relied, in his investigations, on oft-repeated and verifiable\r\nexperiments, as can be seen from his work _De Magnete_. He directs the\r\nexperimenter, for example, to take a piece of loadstone of convenient\r\nsize and turn it on a lathe to the form of a ball. It then may be\r\ncalled a _terrella_, or earthkin. Place on it a piece of iron wire. The\r\nends of the wire move round its middle point and suddenly come to a\r\nstandstill. Mark with chalk the line along which the wire lies still and\r\nsticks. Then move the wire to other spots on the _terrella_ and repeat\r\nyour procedure. The lines thus marked, if produced, will form meridians,\r\nall coming together at the poles. Again, place the magnet in a wooden\r\nvessel, and then set the vessel afloat in a tub or cistern of still\r\nwater. The north pole of the stone will seek approximately the direction\r\nof the south pole of the earth, etc. It was on the basis of scores of\r\nexperiments of this sort, carried on from about 1582 till 1600, that\r\nGilbert felt justified in concluding that the terrestrial globe is a\r\nmagnet. This theory has since that time been abundantly confirmed by\r\nnavigators. The full title of his book is _Concerning the Magnet and\r\nMagnetic Bodies, and concerning the Great Magnet the Earth: A New\r\nNatural History (Physiologia) demonstrated by many Arguments and\r\nExperiments_. It does not detract from the credit of Gilbert's result to\r\nstate that his initial purpose was not to discover the nature of\r\nmagnetism or electricity, but to determine the true substance of the\r\nearth, the innermost constitution of the globe. He was fully conscious\r\nof his own method and speaks with scorn of certain writers who, having\r\nmade no magnetical experiments, constructed ratiocinations on the basis\r\nof mere opinions and old-womanishly dreamed the things that were not.\r\n\r\nGalileo (1564-1642) even as a child displayed something of the\r\ninventor's ingenuity, and when he was nineteen, shortly after the\r\nbeginning of Gilbert's experiments, his keen perception for the\r\nphenomena of motion led to his making a discovery of great scientific\r\nmoment. He observed a lamp swinging by a long chain in the cathedral of\r\nhis native city of Pisa, and noticed that, no matter how much the range\r\nof the oscillations might vary, their times were constant. He verified\r\nhis first impressions by counting his pulse, the only available\r\ntimepiece. Later he invented simple pendulum devices for timing the\r\npulse of patients, and even made some advances in applying his discovery\r\nin the construction of pendulum clocks.\r\n\r\n      b\r\n +---------+\r\n |         |\r\n |         |\r\n |         |\r\n +---------+\r\n |         |\r\n +---------+\r\n\r\n      | c\r\n      |\r\n      |\r\n      |\r\n      |\r\n      |\r\n      |\r\n      | d\r\n      |\r\n      |\r\n      |\r\n      | e\r\n\r\nIn 1589 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the University of\r\nPisa, and within a year or two established through experiment the\r\nfoundations of the science of dynamics. As early as 1590 he put on\r\nrecord, in a Latin treatise _Concerning Motion_ (_De Motu_), his dissent\r\nfrom the theories of Aristotle in reference to moving bodies, confuting\r\nthe Philosopher both by reason and ocular demonstration. Aristotle had\r\nheld that two moving bodies of the same sort and in the same medium have\r\nvelocities in proportion to their weights. If a moving body, whose\r\nweight is represented by _b_, be carried through the line _c--e_ which\r\nis divided in the point _d_, if, also, the moving body is divided\r\naccording to the same proportion as line _c--e_ is in the point _d_, it\r\nis manifest that in the time taken to carry the whole body through\r\n_c--e_, the part will be moved through _c--d_. Galileo said that it is\r\nas clear as daylight that this view is ridiculous, for who would\r\nbelieve that when two lead spheres are dropped from a great height, the\r\none being a hundred times heavier than the other, if the larger took an\r\nhour to reach the earth, the smaller would take a hundred hours? Or,\r\nthat if from a high tower two stones, one twice the weight of the other,\r\nshould be pushed out at the same moment, the larger would strike the\r\nground while the smaller was still midway? His biography tells that\r\nGalileo in the presence of professors and students dropped bodies of\r\ndifferent weights from the height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa to\r\ndemonstrate the truth of his views. If allowance be made for the\r\nfriction of the air, all bodies fall from the same height in equal\r\ntimes: the final velocities are proportional to the times; the spaces\r\npassed through are proportional to the squares of the times. The\r\nexperimental basis of the last two statements was furnished by means of\r\nan inclined plane, down a smooth groove in which a bronze ball was\r\nallowed to pass, the time being ascertained by means of an improvised\r\nwater-clock.\r\n\r\nGalileo's mature views on dynamics received expression in a work\r\npublished in 1638, _Mathematical Discourses and Demonstrations\r\nconcerning Two New Sciences relating to Mechanics and Local Movements_.\r\nIt treats of cohesion and resistance to fracture (strength of\r\nmaterials), and uniform, accelerated, and projectile motion (dynamics).\r\nThe discussion is in conversation form. The opening sentence shows\r\nGalileo's tendency to base theory on the empirical. It might be freely\r\ntranslated thus: \"Large scope for intellectual speculation, I should\r\nthink, would be afforded, gentlemen, by frequent visits to your famous\r\nVenetian Dockyard (_arsenale_), especially that part where mechanics are\r\nin demand; seeing that there every sort of instrument and machine is put\r\nto use by numbers of workmen, among whom, taught both by tradition and\r\ntheir own observation, there must be some very skillful and also able to\r\ntalk.\" The view of the shipbuilders, that a large galley before being\r\nset afloat is in greater danger of breaking under its own weight than a\r\nsmall galley, is the starting-point of this most important of Galileo's\r\ncontributions to science.\r\n\r\nVesalius (1514-1564) had in his work on the structure of the human body\r\n(_De Humani Corporis Fabrica_, 1543) shaken the authority of Galen's\r\nanatomy; it remained for Harvey on the basis of the new anatomy to\r\nimprove upon the Greek physician's experimental physiology. Harvey\r\nprofessed to learn and teach anatomy, not from books, but from\r\ndissections, not from the dogmas of the philosophers, but from the\r\nfabric of nature.\r\n\r\nThere have come down to us notes of his lectures on anatomy delivered\r\nfirst in 1616. A brief extract will show that even at that date he had\r\nalready formulated a theory of the circulation of the blood:--\r\n\r\n\"[Illustration: WH monogram][1] By the structure of the heart it appears\r\nthat the blood is continually transfused through the lungs to the\r\naorta--as by the two clacks of a water-ram for raising water.\r\n\r\n\"It is shown by ligature that there is continuous motion of the blood\r\nfrom arteries to veins.\r\n\r\n\"Whence Δ it is demonstrated that there is a continuous motion of the\r\nblood in a circle, affected by the beat of the heart.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1628 that Harvey published his _Anatomical Disquisition\r\non the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals_. It gives the\r\nexperimental basis of his conclusions. If a live snake be laid open, the\r\nheart will be seen pulsating and propelling its contents. Compress the\r\nlarge vein entering the heart, and the part intervening between the\r\npoint of constriction and the heart becomes empty and the organ pales\r\nand shrinks. Remove the pressure, and the size and color of the heart\r\nare restored. Now compress the artery leading from the organ, and the\r\npart between the heart and the point of pressure, and the heart itself,\r\nbecome distended and take on a deep purple color. The course of the\r\nblood is evidently from the vena cava through the heart to the aorta.\r\nHarvey in his investigations made use of many species of animals--at\r\nleast eighty-seven.\r\n\r\nIt was believed by some, before Harvey's demonstrations, that the\r\narteries were hollow pipes carrying air from the lungs throughout the\r\nbody, although Galen had shown by cutting a dog's trachea, inflating the\r\nlungs and tying the trachea, that the lungs were in an enclosing sack\r\nwhich retained the air. Harvey, following Galen, held that the pulmonary\r\nartery, carrying blood to the lungs from the right side of the heart,\r\nand the pulmonary veins, carrying blood from the lungs to the left side\r\nof the heart, intercommunicate in the hidden porosities of the lungs and\r\nthrough minute inosculations.\r\n\r\nIn man the vena cava carries the blood to the right side of the heart,\r\nthe pulmonary artery inosculates with the pulmonary veins, which convey\r\nit to the left side of the heart. This muscular pump drives it into the\r\naorta. It still remains to be shown that in the limbs the blood passes\r\nfrom the arteries to the veins. Bandage the arm so tightly that no pulse\r\nis felt at the wrist. The hand appears at first natural, and then grows\r\ncold. Loose the bandage sufficiently to restore the pulse. The hand and\r\nforearm become suffused and swollen. In the first place the supply of\r\nblood from the deep-lying arteries is cut off. In the second case the\r\nblood returning by the superficial veins is dammed back. In the limbs as\r\nin the lungs the blood passes from artery to vein by anastomoses and\r\nporosities. All these arteries have their source in the aorta; all these\r\nveins pour their stream ultimately into the vena cava. The veins have\r\nvalves, which prevent the blood flowing except toward the heart. Again,\r\nthe veins and arteries form a connected system; for through either a\r\nvein or an artery all the blood may be drained off. The arguments by\r\nwhich Harvey supported his view were various. The opening clause of his\r\nfirst chapter, \"When I first gave my mind to vivisection as a means of\r\ndiscovering the motions and uses of the heart,\" throws a strong light on\r\nhis special method of experimental investigation.\r\n\r\nBacon, stimulated by what he called _philanthropia_, always aimed, as we\r\nhave seen, to establish man's control over nature. But all power of a\r\nhigh order depends on an understanding of the essential character, or\r\nlaw, of heat, light, sound, gravity, and the like. Nothing short of a\r\nknowledge of the underlying nature of phenomena can give science\r\nadvantage over chance in hitting upon useful discoveries and inventions.\r\nIt is, therefore, natural to find him applying his method of\r\ninduction--his special method of true induction--to the investigation of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let there be mustered, without premature\r\nspeculation, all the instances in which heat is manifested--flame,\r\nlightning, sun's rays, quicklime sprinkled with water, damp hay, animal\r\nheat, hot liquids, bodies subjected to friction. Add to these, instances\r\nin which heat seems to be absent, as moon's rays, sun's rays on\r\nmountains, oblique rays in the polar circle. Try the experiment of\r\nconcentrating on a thermoscope, by means of a burning-glass, the moon's\r\nrays. Try with the burning-glass to concentrate heat from hot iron, from\r\ncommon flame, from boiling water. Try a concave glass with the sun's\r\nrays to see whether a diminution of heat results. Then make record of\r\nother instances, in which heat is found in varying degrees. For example,\r\nan anvil grows hot under the hammer. A thin plate of metal under\r\ncontinuous blows might grow red like ignited iron. Let this be tried as\r\nan experiment.\r\n\r\nAfter the presentation of these instances induction itself must be set\r\nto work to find out what factor is ever present in the positive\r\ninstances, what factor is ever wanting in the negative instances, what\r\nfactor always varies in the instances which show variation. According to\r\nBacon it is in the process of exclusion that the foundations of true\r\ninduction are laid. We can be certain, for example, that the essential\r\nnature of heat does not consist in light and brightness, since it is\r\npresent in boiling water and absent in the moon's rays.\r\n\r\nThe induction, however, is not complete till something positive is\r\nestablished. At this point in the investigation it is permissible to\r\nventure an hypothesis in reference to the essential character of heat.\r\nFrom a survey of the instances, all and each, it appears that the nature\r\nof which heat is a particular case is motion. This is suggested by\r\nflame, simmering liquids, the excitement of heat by motion, the\r\nextinction of fire by compression, etc. Motion is the genus of which\r\nheat is the species. Heat itself, its essence, is motion and nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nIt remains to establish its specific differences. This accomplished, we\r\narrive at the definition: Heat is a motion, expansive, restrained, and\r\nacting in its strife upon the smaller particles of bodies. Bacon,\r\nglancing toward the application of this discovery, adds: \"_If in any\r\nnatural body you can excite a dilating or expanding motion, and can so\r\nrepress this motion and turn it back upon itself, that the dilation\r\nshall not proceed equally, but have its way in one part and be\r\ncounteracted in another, you will undoubtedly generate heat._\" The\r\nreader will recall that Bacon looked for the invention of instruments\r\nthat would generate heat solely by motion.\r\n\r\nDescartes was a philosopher and mathematician. In his _Discourse on\r\nMethod_ and his _Rules for the Direction of the Mind_ (1628) he laid\r\nemphasis on deduction rather than on induction. In the subordination of\r\nparticulars to general principles he experienced a satisfaction akin to\r\nthe sense of beauty or the joy of artistic production. He speaks\r\nenthusiastically of that pleasure which one feels in truth, and which\r\nin this world is about the only pure and unmixed happiness.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he shared Bacon's distrust of the Aristotelian logic\r\nand maintained that ordinary dialectic is valueless for those who desire\r\nto investigate the truth of things. There is need of a method for\r\nfinding out the truth. He compares himself to a smith forced to begin at\r\nthe beginning by fashioning tools with which to work.\r\n\r\nIn his method of discovery he determined to accept nothing as true that\r\nhe did not clearly recognize to be so. He stood against assumptions, and\r\ninsisted on rigid proof. Trust only what is completely known. Attain a\r\ncertitude equal to that of arithmetic and geometry. This attitude of\r\nstrict criticism is characteristic of the scientific mind.\r\n\r\nAgain, Descartes was bent on analyzing each difficulty in order to solve\r\nit; to neglect no intermediate steps in the deduction, but to make the\r\nenumeration of details adequate and methodical. Preserve a certain\r\norder; do not attempt to jump from the ground to the gable, but rise\r\ngradually from what is simple and easily understood.\r\n\r\nDescartes' interest was not in the several branches of mathematics;\r\nrather he wished to establish a universal mathematics, a general science\r\nrelating to order and measurement. He considered all physical nature,\r\nincluding the human body, as a mechanism, capable of explanation on\r\nmathematical principles. But his immediate interest lay in numerical\r\nrelationships and geometrical proportions.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that the understanding was dependent on the other powers of\r\nthe mind, Descartes resorted in his mathematical demonstrations to the\r\nuse of lines, because he could find no method, as he says, more simple\r\nor more capable of appealing to the imagination and senses. He\r\nconsidered, however, that in order to bear the relationships in memory\r\nor to embrace several at once, it was essential to explain them by\r\ncertain formulæ, the shorter the better. And for this purpose it was\r\nrequisite to borrow all that was best in geometrical analysis and\r\nalgebra, and to correct the errors of one by the other.\r\n\r\nDescartes was above all a mathematician, and as such he may be regarded\r\nas a forerunner of Newton and other scientists; at the same time he\r\ndeveloped an exact scientific method, which he believed applicable to\r\nall departments of human thought. \"Those long chains of reasoning,\" he\r\nsays, \"quite simple and easy, which geometers are wont to employ in the\r\naccomplishment of their most difficult demonstrations, led me to think\r\nthat everything which might fall under the cognizance of the human mind\r\nmight be connected together in the same manner, and that, provided only\r\none should take care not to receive anything as true which was not so,\r\nand if one were always careful to preserve the order necessary for\r\ndeducing one truth from another, there would be none so remote at which\r\nhe might not at last arrive, or so concealed which he might not\r\ndiscover.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Francis Bacon, _Philosophical Works_ (Ellis and Spedding edition), vol.\r\n   IV, Novum Organum.\r\n\r\n J.

The improvement of the simple\r\nmicroscope, the invention of the compound microscope, of the telescope,\r\nthe micrometer, the barometer, the thermoscope, the thermometer, the\r\npendulum clock, the improvement of the mural quadrant, sextant, spheres,\r\nastrolabes, belong to this period.\r\n\r\nMeasuring is a sort of counting, and weighing a form of measuring. We\r\nmay count disparate things whether like or unlike. When we measure or\r\nweigh we apply a standard and count the times that the unit--cubit,\r\npound, hour--is found to repeat itself. We apply our measure to uniform\r\nextension, meting out the waters by fathoms or space by the sun's\r\ndiameter, and even subject time to arbitrary divisions. The human mind\r\nhas been developed through contact with the multiplicity of physical\r\nobjects, and we find it impossible to think clearly and scientifically\r\nabout our environment without dividing, weighing, measuring, counting.\r\n\r\nIn measuring time we cannot rely on our inward impressions; we even\r\ncriticize these impressions and speak of time as going slowly or\r\nquickly. We are compelled in the interests of accuracy to provide an\r\nobjective standard in the clock, or the revolving earth, or some other\r\nmeasurable thing. Similarly with weight and heat; we cannot rely on the\r\nsubjective impression, but must devise apparatus to record by a\r\nmeasurable movement the amount of the pressure or the degree of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\"God ordered all things by measure, number, and weight.\" The scientific\r\nmind does not rest satisfied till it is able to see phenomena in their\r\nnumber relationships. Scientific thought is in this sense Pythagorean,\r\nthat it inquires in reference to quantity and proportion.\r\n\r\nAs implied in a previous chapter, number relations are not clearly\r\ngrasped by primitive races. Many primitive languages have no words for\r\nnumerals higher than five. That fact does not imply that these races do\r\nnot know the difference between large and small numbers, but precision\r\ngrows with civilization, with commercial pursuits, and other activities,\r\nsuch as the practice of medicine, to which the use of weights and\r\nmeasures is essential. Scientific accuracy is dependent on words and\r\nother means of numerical expression. From the use of fingers and toes, a\r\nrude score or tally, knots on a string, or a simple abacus, the race\r\nadvances to greater refinement of numerical expression and the\r\nemployment of more and more accurate apparatus.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest contributors to this advance was the celebrated\r\nDanish astronomer, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601). Before 1597 he had completed\r\nhis great mural quadrant at the observatory of Uraniborg. He called it\r\nwith characteristic vanity the Tichonic quadrant. It consisted of a\r\ngraduated arc of solid polished brass five inches broad, two inches\r\nthick, and with a radius of about six and three quarters feet. Each\r\ndegree was divided into minutes, and each minute into six parts. Each of\r\nthese parts was then subdivided into ten seconds, which were indicated\r\nby dots arranged in transverse oblique lines on the width of brass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TICHONIC QUADRANT]\r\n\r\nThe arc was attached in the observation room to a wall running exactly\r\nnorth, and so secured with screws (_firmissimis cochleis_) that no force\r\ncould move it. With its concavity toward the southern sky it was closely\r\ncomparable, though reverse, to the celestial meridian throughout its\r\nlength from horizon to zenith. The south wall, above the point where the\r\nradii of the quadrant met, was pierced by a cylinder of gilded brass\r\nplaced in a rectangular opening, which could be opened or closed from\r\nthe outside. The observation was made through one of two sights that\r\nwere attached to the graduated arc and could be moved from point to\r\npoint on it. In the sights were parallel slits, right, left, upper,\r\nlower. If the altitude and the transit through the meridian were to be\r\ntaken at the same time the four directions were to be followed. It was\r\nthe practice for the student making the observation to read off the\r\nnumber of degrees, minutes, etc., of the angle at which the altitude or\r\ntransit was observed, so that it might be recorded by a second student.\r\nA third took the time from two clock dials when the observer gave the\r\nsignal, and the exact moment of observation was also recorded by\r\nstudent number two. The clocks recorded minutes and the smaller\r\ndivisions of time; great care, however, was required to obtain good\r\nresults from them. There were four clocks in the observatory, of which\r\nthe largest had three wheels, one wheel of pure solid brass having\r\ntwelve hundred teeth and a diameter of two cubits.\r\n\r\nLest any space on the wall should lie empty a number of paintings were\r\nadded: Tycho himself in an easy attitude seated at a table and directing\r\nfrom a book the work of his students. Over his head is an automatic\r\ncelestial globe invented by Tycho and constructed at his own expense in\r\n1590. Over the globe is a part of Tycho's library. On either side are\r\nrepresented as hanging small pictures of Tycho's patron, Frederick II of\r\nDenmark (d. 1588) and Queen Sophia. Then other instruments and rooms of\r\nthe observatory are pictured; Tycho's students, of whom there were\r\nalways at least six or eight, not to mention younger pupils. There\r\nappears also his great brass globe six feet in diameter. Then there is\r\npictured Tycho's chemical laboratory, on which he has expended much\r\nmoney. Finally comes one of Tycho's hunting dogs--very faithful and\r\nsagacious; he serves here as a hieroglyph of his master's nobility as\r\nwell as of sagacity and fidelity. The expert architect and the two\r\nartists who assisted Tycho are delineated in the landscape and even in\r\nthe setting sun in the top-most part of the painting, and in the\r\ndecoration above.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of this largest quadrant was the determination of the\r\nangle of elevation of the stars within the sixth part of a minute, the\r\ncollineation being made by means of one of the sights, the parallel\r\nhorizontal slits in which were aligned with the corresponding parts of\r\nthe circumference of the cylinder. The altitude was recorded according\r\nto the position of the sight attached to the graduated arc.\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe had a great reverence for Copernicus, but he did not accept\r\nhis planetary system; and he felt that advance in astronomy depended on\r\npainstaking observation. For over twenty years under the kings of\r\nDenmark he had good opportunities for pursuing his investigation. The\r\nisland of Hven became his property. A thoroughly equipped observatory\r\nwas provided, including printing-press and workshops for the\r\nconstruction of apparatus. As already implied, capable assistants were\r\nat the astronomer's command. In 1598, after having left Denmark, Tycho\r\nin a splendid illustrated book (_Astronomiæ Instauratæ Mechanica_) gave\r\nan account of this astronomical paradise on the Insula Venusia as he at\r\ntimes called it. The book, prepared for the hands of princes, contains\r\nabout twenty full-page colored illustrations of astronomical instruments\r\n(including, of course, the mural quadrant), of the exterior of the\r\nobservatory of Uraniborg, etc. The author had a consciousness of his own\r\nworth, and deserves the name Tycho the Magnificent. The results that\r\nhe obtained were not unworthy of the apparatus employed in his\r\nobservations, and before he died at Prague in 1601, Tycho Brahe had\r\nconsigned to the worthiest hands the painstaking record of his labors.\r\n\r\nJohann Kepler (1571-1630) had been called, as the astronomer's\r\nassistant, to the Bohemian capital in 1600 and in a few months fell heir\r\nto Tycho's data in reference to 777 stars, which he made the basis of\r\nthe Rudolphine tables of 1627. Kepler's genius was complementary to that\r\nof his predecessor. He was gifted with an imagination to turn\r\nobservations to account. His astronomy did not rest in mere description,\r\nbut sought the physical explanation. He had the artist's feeling for the\r\nbeauty and harmony, which he divined before he demonstrated, in the\r\nnumber relations of the planetary movements. After special studies of\r\nMars based on Tycho's data, he set forth in 1609 (_Astronomia Nova_) (1)\r\nthat every planet moves in an ellipse of which the sun occupies one\r\nfocus, and (2) that the area swept by the radius vector from the planet\r\nto the sun is proportional to the time. Luckily for the success of his\r\ninvestigation the planet on which he had concentrated his attention is\r\nthe one of all the planets then known, the orbit of which most widely\r\ndiffers from a circle. In a later work (_Harmonica Mundi_, 1619) the\r\ntitle of which, the _Harmonics of the Universe_, proclaimed his\r\ninclination to Pythagorean views, he demonstrated (3) that the square of\r\nthe periodic time of any planet is proportional to the cube of its mean\r\ndistance from the sun.\r\n\r\nKepler's studies were facilitated by the invention, in 1614 by John\r\nNapier, of logarithms, which have been said, by abridging tedious\r\ncalculations, to double the life of an astronomer. About the same time\r\nKepler in purchasing some wine was struck by the rough-and-ready method\r\nused by the merchant to determine the capacity of the wine-vessels. He\r\napplied himself for a few days to the problems of mensuration involved,\r\nand in 1615 published his treatise (_Stereometria Doliorum_) on the\r\ncubical contents of casks (or wine-jars), a source of inspiration to all\r\nlater writers on the accurate determination of the volume of solids. He\r\nhelped other scientists and was himself richly helped. As early as 1610\r\nthere had been presented to him a means of precision of the first\r\nimportance to the progress of astronomy, namely, a Galilean telescope.\r\n\r\nThe early history of telescopes shows that the effect of combining two\r\nlenses was understood by scientists long before any particular use was\r\nmade of this knowledge; and that those who are accredited with\r\nintroducing perspective glasses to the public hit by accident upon the\r\ninvention. Priority was claimed by two firms of spectacle-makers in\r\nMiddelburg, Holland, namely, Zacharias, miscalled Jansen, and\r\nLippershey. Galileo heard of the contrivance in July, 1609, and soon\r\nfurnished so powerful an instrument of discovery that things seen\r\nthrough it appeared more than thirty times nearer and almost a thousand\r\ntimes larger than when seen by the naked eye. He was able to make out\r\nthe mountains in the moon, the satellites of Jupiter in rotation, the\r\nspots on the revolving sun; but his telescope afforded only an imperfect\r\nview of Saturn. Of course these facts, published in 1610 (_Sidereus\r\nNuncius_), strengthened his advocacy of the Copernican system. Galileo\r\nlaughingly wrote Kepler that the professors of philosophy were afraid to\r\nlook through his telescope lest they should fall into heresy. The German\r\nastronomer, who had years before written on the optics of astronomy,\r\nnow (1611) produced his _Dioptrice_, the first satisfactory statement of\r\nthe theory of the telescope.\r\n\r\nAbout 1639 Gascoigne, a young Englishman, invented the micrometer, which\r\nenables an observer to adjust a telescope with very great precision.\r\nBefore the invention of the micrometer exactitude was impossible,\r\nbecause the adjustment of the instrument depended on the discrimination\r\nof the naked eye. The micrometer was a further advance in exact\r\nmeasurement. Gascoigne's determinations of, for example, the diameter of\r\nthe sun, bear comparison with the findings of even recent astronomical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe history of the microscope is closely connected with that of the\r\ntelescope. In the first half of the seventeenth century the simple\r\nmicroscope came into use. It was developed from the convex lens, which,\r\nas we have seen in a previous chapter, had been known for centuries, if\r\nnot from remote antiquity. With the simple microscope Leeuwenhoek before\r\n1673 had studied the structure of minute animal organisms and ten years\r\nlater had even obtained sight of bacteria. Very early in the same\r\ncentury Zacharias had presented Prince Maurice, the commander of the\r\nDutch forces, and the Archduke Albert, governor of Holland, with\r\ncompound microscopes. Kircher (1601-1680) made use of an instrument that\r\nrepresented microscopic forms as one thousand times larger than their\r\nactual size, and by means of the compound microscope Malpighi was able\r\nin 1661 to see blood flowing from the minute arteries to the minute\r\nveins on the lung and on the distended bladder of the live frog. The\r\nItalian microscopist thus, among his many achievements, verified by\r\nobservation what Harvey in 1628 had argued must take place.\r\n\r\nIn this same epoch apparatus of precision developed in other fields.\r\nWeight clocks had been in use as time-measurers since the thirteenth\r\ncentury, but they were, as we have seen, difficult to control and\r\notherwise unreliable. Even in the seventeenth century scientists in\r\ntheir experiments preferred some form of water-clock. In 1636 Galileo,\r\nin a letter, mentioned the feasibility of constructing a pendulum clock,\r\nand in 1641 he dictated a description of the projected apparatus to his\r\nson Vincenzo and to his disciple Viviani. He himself was then blind, and\r\nhe died the following year. His instructions were never carried into\r\neffect. However, in 1657 Christian Huygens applied the pendulum to\r\nweight clocks of the old stamp. In 1674 he gave directions for the\r\nmanufacture of a watch, the movement of which was driven by a spring.\r\n\r\nGalileo, to whom the advance in exact science is so largely indebted,\r\nmust also be credited with the first apparatus for the measurement of\r\ntemperatures. This was invented before 1603 and consisted of a glass\r\nbulb with a long stem of the thickness of a straw. The bulb was first\r\nheated and the stem placed in water. The point at which the water, which\r\nrose in the tube, might stand was an indication of the temperature. In\r\n1631 Jean Rey just inverted this contrivance, filling the bulb with\r\nwater. Of course these thermoscopes would register the effect of varying\r\npressures as well as temperatures, and they soon made way for the\r\nthermometer and the barometer. Before 1641 a true thermometer was\r\nconstructed by sealing the top of the tube after driving out the air by\r\nheat. Spirits of wine were used in place of water. Mercury was not\r\nemployed till 1670.\r\n\r\nDescartes and Galileo had brought under criticism the ancient idea that\r\nnature abhors a vacuum. They knew that the _horror vacui_ was not\r\nsufficient to raise water in a pump more than about thirty-three feet.\r\nThey had also known that air has weight, a fact which soon served to\r\nexplain the so-called force of suction. Galileo's associate Torricelli\r\nreasoned that if the pressure of the air was sufficient to support a\r\ncolumn of water thirty-three feet in height, it would support a column\r\nof mercury of equal weight. Accordingly in 1643 he made the experiment\r\nof filling with mercury a glass tube four feet long closed at the upper\r\nend, and then opening the lower end in a basin of mercury. The mercury\r\nin the tube sank until its level was about thirty inches above that of\r\nthe mercury in the basin, leaving a vacuum in the upper part of the\r\ntube. As the specific gravity of mercury is 13, Torricelli knew that his\r\nsupposition had been correct and that the column of mercury in the tube\r\nand the column of water in the pump were owing to the pressure or weight\r\nof the air.\r\n\r\nPascal thought that this pressure would be less at a high altitude. His\r\nsupposition was tested on a church steeple at Paris, and, later, on the\r\nPuy de Dôme, a mountain in Auvergne. In the latter case a difference of\r\nthree inches in the column of mercury was shown at the summit and base\r\nof the ascent. Later Pascal experimented with the siphon and succeeded\r\nin explaining it on the principle of atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nTorricelli in the space at the top of his barometer (pressure-gauge) had\r\nproduced what is called a Torricellian vacuum. Otto von Guericke, a\r\nburgomaster of Magdeburg, who had traveled in France and Italy,\r\nsucceeded in constructing an air-pump by means of which air might be\r\nexhausted from a vessel. Some of his results became widely known in\r\n1657, though his works were not published till 1673.\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle (1626-1691), born at Castle Lismore in Ireland, was the\r\nseventh son and fourteenth child of the distinguished first Earl of\r\nCork. He was early acquainted with these various experiments in\r\nreference to the air, as well as with Descartes' theory that air\r\nis nothing but a congeries or heap of small, and, for the most\r\npart, flexible particles. In 1659 he wrote his _New Experiments\r\nPhysico-Mechanical touching the Spring of the Air_. Instead of _spring_,\r\nhe at times used the word _elater_ (ἐλατὴρ). In this treatise he\r\ndescribes experiments with the improved air-pump constructed at his\r\nsuggestion by his assistant, Robert Hooke.\r\n\r\nOne of Boyle's critics, a professor at Louvain, while admitting that air\r\nhad weight and elasticity, denied that these were sufficient to account\r\nfor the results ascribed to them. Boyle thereupon published a _Defence\r\nof the Doctrine touching the Spring and Weight of the Air_. He felt able\r\nto prove that the elasticity of the air could under circumstances do far\r\nmore than sustain twenty-nine or thirty inches of mercury. In support of\r\nhis view he cited a recent experiment.\r\n\r\nHe had taken a piece of strong glass tubing fully twelve feet in length.\r\n(The experiment was made by a well-lighted staircase, the tube being\r\nsuspended by strings.) The glass was heated more than a foot from the\r\nlower end, and bent so that the shorter leg of twelve inches was\r\nparallel with the longer. The former was hermetically sealed at the top\r\nand marked off in forty-eight quarter-inch spaces. Into the opening of\r\nthe longer leg, also graduated, mercury was poured. At first only enough\r\nwas introduced to fill the arch, or bent part of the tube below the\r\ngraduated legs. The tube was then inclined so that the air might pass\r\nfrom one leg to the other, and equality of pressure at the start be\r\nassured. Then more mercury was introduced and every time that the air in\r\nthe shorter leg was compressed a half or a quarter of an inch, a record\r\nwas made of the height of the mercury in the long leg of the tube. Boyle\r\nreasoned that the compressed air was sustaining the pressure of the\r\ncolumn of mercury in the long leg _plus_ the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nat the tube's opening, equivalent to 29-2/16 inches of mercury. Some of\r\nthe results were as follows: When the air in the short tube was\r\ncompressed from 12 to 3 inches, it was under a pressure of 117-9/16\r\ninches of mercury; when compressed to 4 it was under pressure of\r\n87-15/16 inches of mercury; when compressed to 6, 58-13/16; to 9,\r\n39-5/8. Of course, when at the beginning of the experiment there were 12\r\ninches of air in the short tube, it was under the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, equal to that of 29-2/16 inches of mercury. Boyle with\r\ncharacteristic caution was not inclined to draw too general a conclusion\r\nfrom his experiment. However, it was evident, making allowance for some\r\nslight irregularity in the experimental results, that air reduced under\r\npressure to one half its original volume, doubles its resistance; and\r\nthat if it is further reduced to one half,--for example, from six to\r\nthree inches,--it has four times the resistance of common air. In fact,\r\nBoyle had sustained the hypothesis that supposes the pressures and\r\nexpansions to be in reciprocal proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Sir Robert S.

His letters\r\nto Galileo, Jean Rey, Hobbes, Descartes, Gassendi, not to mention other\r\nscientists and philosophers, constitute an encyclopedia of the learning\r\nof the time. A mathematician and experimenter himself, he had a genius\r\nfor eliciting discussion and research by means of adroit questions.\r\nThrough him Descartes was drawn into debate with Hobbes, and with\r\nGassendi, a champion of the experimental method. Through him the\r\ndiscoveries of Harvey, Galileo, and Torricelli, as well as of many\r\nothers, became widely known. His letters, in the dearth of scientific\r\nassociations and the absence of scientific periodicals, served as a\r\ngeneral news agency among the learned of his time. It is not surprising\r\nthat a coterie gathered about him at Paris. Hobbes spent months in\r\ndaily intercourse with this group of scientists in the winter of\r\n1636-37.\r\n\r\nHartlib, though he scarcely takes rank with Mersenne as a scientist, was\r\nno less influential. Of a generous and philanthropic disposition, he\r\nrepeatedly impoverished himself in the cause of human betterment. His\r\nchief reliance was on education and improved methods of husbandry, but\r\nhe resembled Horace Greeley in his hospitality to any project for the\r\npublic welfare.\r\n\r\nOne of Hartlib's chief hopes for the regeneration of England, if not of\r\nthe whole world, rested on the teachings of the educational reformer\r\nComenius, a bishop of the Moravian Brethren. In 1637, Comenius having\r\nshown himself rather reluctant to put his most cherished plans before\r\nthe public, his zealous disciple precipitated matters, and on his own\r\nresponsibility, and unknown to Comenius, issued from his library at\r\nOxford _Preludes to the Endeavors of Comenius_. Besides Hartlib's\r\npreface it contained a treatise by the great educator on a _Seminary of\r\nChristian Pansophy_, a method of imparting an encyclopedic knowledge of\r\nthe sciences and arts.\r\n\r\nThe two friends were followers of the Baconian philosophy. They were\r\ninfluenced, as many others of the time, by the _New Atlantis_, which\r\nwent through ten editions between 1627 and 1670, and which outlined a\r\nplan for an endowed college with thirty-six Fellows divided into\r\ngroups--what would be called to-day a university of research endowed by\r\nthe State. It is not surprising to find Comenius (who in his student\r\ndays had been under the influence of Alsted, author of an encyclopedia\r\non Baconian lines) speaking in 1638 on the need of a collegiate society\r\nfor carrying on the educational work that he himself had at heart.\r\n\r\nIn 1641 Hartlib published a work of fiction in the manner of the _New\r\nAtlantis_, and dedicated it to the Long Parliament. In the same year he\r\nurged Comenius to come to London, and published another work, _A\r\nReformation of Schools_. He had great influence and did not hesitate to\r\nuse it in his adoptive country. Everybody knew Hartlib, and he was\r\nacquainted with all the strata of English society; for although his\r\nfather had been a merchant, first in Poland and later in Elbing, his\r\nmother was the daughter of the Deputy of the English Company in Dantzic\r\nand had relatives of rank in London, where Hartlib spent most of his\r\nlife. He gained the good-will of the Puritan Government, and even after\r\nCromwell's death was working, in conjunction with Boyle, for the\r\nestablishment of a national council of universal learning with Wilkins\r\nas president.\r\n\r\nWhen Comenius arrived in London he learned that the invitation had been\r\nsent by order of Parliament. This body was very anxious to take up the\r\nquestion of education, especially university education. Bacon's\r\ncriticisms of Oxford and Cambridge were still borne in mind; the\r\nlegislators considered that the college curriculum was in need of\r\nreformation, that there ought to be more fraternity and correspondence\r\namong the universities of Europe, and they even contemplated the\r\nendowment by the State of scientific experiment. They spoke of erecting\r\na university at London, where Gresham College had been established in\r\n1597 and Chelsea College in 1610. It was proposed to place Gresham\r\nCollege, the Savoy, or Winchester College, at the disposition of the\r\npansophists. Comenius thought that nothing was more certain than that\r\nthe design of the great Verulam concerning the opening somewhere of a\r\nuniversal college, devoted to the advancement of the sciences, could be\r\ncarried out. The impending struggle, however, between Charles I and the\r\nParliament prevented the attempt to realize the pansophic dream, and the\r\nAustrian Slav, who knew something of the horrors of civil war, withdrew,\r\ndiscouraged, to the Continent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Hartlib did not abandon the cause, but in 1644 broached\r\nMilton on the subject of educational reform, and drew from him the brief\r\nbut influential tract on _Education_. In this its author alludes rather\r\nslightingly to Comenius, who had something of Bacon's infelicity in\r\nchoice of titles and epithets and who must have seemed outlandish to the\r\nauthor of _Lycidas_ and _Comus_. But Milton joined in the criticism of\r\nthe universities--the study of words rather than things--and advocated\r\nan encyclopedic education based on the Greek and Latin writers of a\r\npractical and scientific tendency (Aristotle, Theophrastus, Cato, Varro,\r\nVitruvius, Seneca, and others). He outlined a plan for the establishment\r\nof an institution to be known by the classical (and Shakespearian) name\r\n\"Academy\"--a plan destined to have a great effect on education in the\r\ndirection indicated by the friends of pansophia.\r\n\r\nIn this same year Robert Boyle, then an eager student of eighteen just\r\nreturned to England from residence abroad, came under the influence of\r\nthe genial Hartlib. In 1646 he writes his tutor inquiring about books\r\non methods of husbandry and referring to the new philosophical college,\r\nwhich valued no knowledge but as it had a tendency to use. A few months\r\nlater he was in correspondence with Hartlib in reference to the\r\nInvisible College, and had written a third friend that the corner-stones\r\nof the invisible, or, as they termed themselves, the philosophical\r\ncollege, did now and then honor him with their company. These\r\nphilosophers whom Boyle entertained, and whose scientific acumen,\r\nbreadth of mind, humility, and universal good-will he found so\r\ncongenial, were the nucleus of the Royal Society of London, of which, on\r\nits definite organization in 1662, he was the foremost member. They had\r\nbegun to meet together in London about 1645, worthy persons inquisitive\r\ninto natural philosophy--Wilkins, interested in the navigation of the\r\nair and of waters below the surface; Wallis, mathematician and\r\ngrammarian; the many-sided Petty, political economist, and inventor of a\r\ndouble-bottomed boat, who had as a youth of twenty studied with Hobbes\r\nin Paris in 1643, and in 1648 was to write his first treatise on\r\nindustrial education at the suggestion of Hartlib, and finally make a\r\nsurvey of Ireland and acquire large estates; Foster, professor of\r\nastronomy at Gresham College; Theodore Haak from the Pfalz; a number of\r\nmedical men, Dr. Merret, Dr. Ent, a friend of Harvey, Dr. Goddard, who\r\ncould always be relied upon to undertake an experiment, Dr. Glisson, the\r\nphysiologist, author in 1654 of a treatise on the liver (_De Hepate_),\r\nand others. They met once a week at Goddard's in Wood Street, at the\r\nBull's Head Tavern in Cheapside, and at Gresham College.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilkins, the brother-in-law of Cromwell, who is regarded by some as\r\nthe founder of the Royal Society, removed to Oxford, as Warden of\r\nWadham, in 1649. Here he held meetings and conducted experiments in\r\nconjunction with Wallis, Goddard, Petty, Boyle, and others, including\r\nWard (afterwards Bishop of Salisbury) interested in Bulliau's Astronomy;\r\nand the celebrated physician and anatomist, Thomas Willis, author of a\r\nwork on the brain (_Cerebri Anatome_), and another on fevers (_De\r\nFebribus_), in which he described epidemic typhoid as it occurred during\r\nthe Civil War in 1643.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the weekly meetings in London continued, and were\r\nattended when convenient by members of the Oxford group. At Gresham\r\nCollege by 1658 it was the custom to remain for discussion Wednesdays\r\nand Thursdays after Mr. Wren's lecture and Mr. Rooke's. During the\r\nunsettled state of the country after Cromwell's death there was some\r\ninterruption of the meetings, but with the accession of Charles II in\r\n1660 there came a greater sense of security. New names appear on the\r\nrecords, Lord Brouncker, Sir Robert Moray, John Evelyn, Brereton, Ball,\r\nRobert Hooke, and Abraham Cowley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a print of 1675_\r\n\r\nWADHAM COLLEGE, OXFORD]\r\n\r\nPlans were discussed for a more permanent form of organization,\r\nespecially on November 28, 1660, when something was said of a design to\r\nfound a college for the promotion of physico-mathematical experimental\r\nlearning. A few months later was published Cowley's proposition for an\r\nendowed college with twenty professors, four of whom should be\r\nconstantly traveling in the interests of science. The sixteen resident\r\nprofessors \"should be bound to study and teach all sorts of natural,\r\nexperimental philosophy, to consist of the mathematics, mechanics,\r\nmedicine, anatomy, chemistry, the history of animals, plants, minerals,\r\nelements, etc.; agriculture, architecture, art military, navigation,\r\ngardening; the mysteries of all trades and improvement of them; the\r\nfacture of all merchandise, all natural magic or divination; and briefly\r\nall things contained in the Catalogue of Natural Histories annexed to my\r\nLord Bacon's _Organon_.\" The early official history of the Royal Society\r\n(Sprat, 1667) says that this proposal hastened very much the adoption of\r\na plan of organization. Cowley wished to educate youth and incur great\r\nexpense (£4,000), but \"most of the other particulars of his draught the\r\nRoyal Society is now putting in practice.\"\r\n\r\nA charter of incorporation was granted in July, 1662; and, later,\r\nCharles II proclaimed himself founder and patron of the Royal Society\r\nfor the advancement of natural science. Charles continued to take an\r\ninterest in this organization, devoted to the discovery of truth by the\r\ncorporate action of men; he proposed subjects for investigation, and\r\nasked their coöperation in a more accurate measurement of a degree of\r\nlatitude. He showed himself tactful to take account of the democratic\r\nspirit of scientific investigation, and recommended to the Royal Society\r\nJohn Graunt, the author of a work on mortality statistics first\r\npublished in 1661. Graunt was a shop-keeper of London, and Charles said\r\nthat if they found any more such tradesmen, they should be sure to admit\r\nthem all without more ado.\r\n\r\nIt was a recognized principle of the Society freely to admit men of\r\ndifferent religions, countries, professions. Sprat said that they openly\r\nprofessed, not to lay the foundation of an English, Scotch, Irish,\r\nPopish or Protestant philosophy, but a philosophy of mankind. They\r\nsought (hating war as most of them did) to establish a universal\r\nculture, or, as they phrased it, a constant intelligence throughout all\r\ncivil nations. Even for the special purposes of the Society, hospitality\r\ntoward all nations was necessary; for the ideal scientist, the perfect\r\nphilosopher, should have the diligence and inquisitiveness of the\r\nnorthern nations, and the cold and circumspect and wary disposition of\r\nthe Italians and Spaniards. Haak from the German Palatinate was one of\r\nthe earliest Fellows of the Society, and is even credited by Wallis with\r\nbeing the first to suggest the meetings of 1645. Oldenburg from Bremen\r\nacted as secretary (along with Wilkins) and carried on an extensive\r\nforeign correspondence. Huygens of Holland was one of the original\r\nFellows in 1663, while the names of Auzout, Sorbière, the Duke of\r\nBrunswick, Bulliau, Cassini, Malpighi, Leibnitz, Leeuwenhoek (as well as\r\nWinthrop and Roger Williams) appear in the records of the Society within\r\nthe first decade. It seemed fitting that this cosmopolitan organization\r\nshould be located in the world's metropolis rather than in a mere\r\nuniversity town. Sprat thought London the natural seat of a universal\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nAs already implied, the Royal Society was not exclusive in its attitude\r\ntoward the different vocations. A spirit of true fellowship prevailed in\r\nGresham College, as the Society was sometimes called. The medical\r\nprofession, the universities, the churches, the court, the army, the\r\nnavy, trade, agriculture, and other industries were there represented.\r\nSocial partition walls were broken down, and the Fellows, sobered by\r\nyears of political and religious strife, joined, mutually assisting one\r\nanother, in the advance of science for the sake of the common weal.\r\nTheir express purpose was the improvement of all professions from the\r\nhighest general to the lowest artisan. Particular attention was paid to\r\nthe trades, the mechanic arts, and the fostering of inventions. One of\r\ntheir eight committees dealt with the histories of trades; another was\r\nconcerned with mechanical inventions, and the king ordained in 1662 that\r\nno mechanical device should receive a patent before undergoing\r\ntheir scrutiny. A great many inventions emanated from the Fellows\r\nthemselves--Hooke's hygroscope; Boyle's hydrometer, of use in the\r\ndetection of counterfeit coin; and, again, the tablet anemometer used by\r\nSir Christopher Wren (the Leonardo da Vinci of his age) to register the\r\nvelocity of the wind. A third committee devoted itself to agriculture,\r\nand in the Society's museum were collected products and curiosities of\r\nthe shop, mine, sea, etc. One Fellow advised that attention should be\r\npaid even to the least and plainest of phenomena, as otherwise they\r\nmight learn the romance of nature rather than its true history. So bent\r\nwere they on preserving a spirit of simplicity and straightforwardness\r\nthat in their sober discussions they sought to employ the language of\r\nartisans, countrymen, and merchants rather than that of wits and\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\nOf course there was in the Society a predominance of gentlemen of means\r\nand leisure, \"free and unconfined.\" Their presence was thought to serve\r\na double purpose. It checked the tendency to sacrifice the search of\r\ntruth to immediate profit, and to lay such emphasis on application, as,\r\nin the words of a subsequent president of the Society, would make truth,\r\nand wisdom, and knowledge of no importance for their own sakes. In the\r\nsecond place their presence was held to check dogmatism on the part of\r\nthe leaders, and subservience on the part of their followers. They\r\nunderstood how difficult it is to transmit knowledge without putting\r\ninitiative in jeopardy and that quiet intellect is easily dismayed in\r\nthe presence of bold speech. The Society accepted the authority of no\r\none, and adopted as its motto _Nullius in Verba_.\r\n\r\nIn this attitude they were aided by their subject and method. Search for\r\nscientific truth by laboratory procedure does not favor dogmatism. The\r\nearly meetings were taken up with experiments and discussions. The\r\nFellows recognized that the mental powers are raised to a higher degree\r\nin company than in solitude. They welcomed diversity of view and the\r\ncommon-sense judgment of the onlooker. As in the Civil War the private\r\ncitizen had held his own with the professional soldier, so here the\r\ncontribution of the amateur to the discussion was not to be despised.\r\nThey had been taught to shun all forms of narrowness and intolerance.\r\nThey wished to avoid the pedantry of the mere scholar, and the allied\r\nstates of mind to which all individuals are liable; they valued the\r\nconcurring testimony of the well-informed assembly. In the investigation\r\nof truth by the experimental method they even arrived at the view that\r\n\"true experimenting has this one thing inseparable from it, never to be\r\na fixed and settled art, and never to be limited by constant rules.\" In\r\nits incipience at least it is evident that the Royal Society was filled\r\nwith the spirit of tolerance and coöperation, and was singularly free\r\nfrom the spirit of envy and faction.\r\n\r\nNot least important of the joint labors of the Society were its\r\npublications, which established contacts and stimulated research\r\nthroughout the scientific world. Besides the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_, which, since their first appearance in 1665, are the most\r\nimportant source of information concerning the development of modern\r\nscience, the Royal Society printed many important works, among which the\r\nfollowing will indicate its early achievements:--\r\n\r\n Hooke, Robert, _Micrographia: or some Physiological Descriptions of\r\n   Minute Bodies made by Magnifying Glasses_. 1665.\r\n\r\n Graunt, John, _Natural and Political Observations ... made upon the\r\n   Bills of Mortality, with reference to the Government, Religion,\r\n   Trade, Growth, Air, Diseases, and the several changes of the City_.\r\n   3d edition, 1665.\r\n\r\n Sprat, Thomas, _The History of the Royal Society of London, for the\r\n   Improving of Natural Knowledge_. 1667.\r\n\r\n Malpighi, Marcello, _Dissertatio epistolica de Bombyce; Societati Regiæ\r\n   Londini dicata_. 1669.

Londini, 1687.\r\n\r\nAfter the Society had ordered that Newton's _Mathematical Principles of\r\nNatural Philosophy_ should be printed, it was found that the funds had\r\nbeen exhausted by the publication of Willughby's book on fishes. It was\r\naccordingly agreed that Halley should undertake the business of looking\r\nafter it, and printing it at his own charge, which he had engaged to do.\r\nShortly after, the President of the Royal Society, Mr. Samuel Pepys, was\r\ndesired to license Mr. Newton's book.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely by defraying the expense of publication that Halley\r\ncontributed to the success of the _Principia_. He, Wren, Hooke, and\r\nother Fellows of the Royal Society, concluded in 1684 that if Kepler's\r\nthird law were true, then the attraction exerted on the different\r\nplanets would vary inversely as the square of the distance. What, then,\r\nwould be the orbit of a planet under a central attraction varying as the\r\ninverse square of the distance? Halley found that Newton had already\r\ndetermined that the form of the orbit would be an ellipse. Newton had\r\nbeen occupied with the problem of gravitation for about eighteen years,\r\nbut until Halley induced him to do so, had hesitated, on account of\r\ncertain unsettled points, to publish his results.\r\n\r\nHe writes: \"I began (1666) to think of gravity extending to the orb of\r\nthe moon, ... and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon\r\nin her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth, and\r\nfound them answer pretty nearly.\" As early as March of that same year\r\nHooke had communicated to the Society an account of experiments in\r\nreference to the force of gravity at different distances from the\r\nsurface of the earth, either upwards or downwards. At this and at every\r\npoint in Newton's discovery the records of co-workers are to be found.\r\n\r\nBy Flamsteed, the first Royal Astronomer, were supplied more accurate\r\ndata for the determination of planetary orbits. To Huygens Newton was\r\nindebted for the laws of centrifugal force. Two doubts had made his\r\nmeticulous mind pause--one, of the accuracy of the data in reference to\r\nthe measurement of the meridian, another, of the attraction of a\r\nspherical shell upon an external point. In the first matter the Royal\r\nSociety, as we have seen, had been long interested, and Picard, who had\r\nworked on the measurement of the earth under the auspices of the\r\nAcadémie des Sciences, brought his results, which came to the attention\r\nof Newton, before the Royal Society in 1672. The second difficulty was\r\nsolved by Newton himself in 1685, when he proved that a series of\r\nconcentric spherical shells would act on an external point as if their\r\nmass were concentrated at the center. For his calculations henceforth\r\nthe planets and stars, comets and all other bodies are points acted on\r\nby lines of force, and \"Every particle of matter in the universe\r\nattracts every other particle with a force varying inversely as the\r\nsquare of their mutual distances, and directly as the mass of the\r\nattracting particle.\" He deduced from this law that the earth must be\r\nflattened at the poles; he determined the orbit of the moon and of\r\ncomets; he explained the precession of the equinoxes, the semi-diurnal\r\ntides, the ratio of the mass of the moon and the earth, of the sun and\r\nthe earth, etc. No wonder that Laplace considered that Newton's\r\n_Principia_ was assured a preëminence above all the other productions of\r\nthe human intellect. It is no detraction from Newton's merit to say that\r\nHalley, Hooke, Wren, Huygens, Bulliau, Picard, and many other\r\ncontemporaries (not to mention Kepler and _his_ predecessors), as well\r\nas the organizations in which they were units, share the glory of the\r\nresult which they coöperated to achieve. On the contrary, he seems much\r\nmore conspicuous in the social firmament because, in spite of the\r\nausterity and seeming independence of his genius, he formed part of a\r\nsystem, and was under its law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portrait by John Van der Bank_ _By permission of W.

Franklin represents the eighteenth\r\ncentury in his steadfast pursuit of intellectual, social, and political\r\nemancipation. And in his long fight, calmly waged, against the forces of\r\nwant, superstition, and intolerance, such as still hamper the\r\ndevelopment of aspiring youth in America, England, and elsewhere, he\r\nfound science no mean ally.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason for believing that the Franklins (_francus_--free)\r\nwere of a free line, free from that vassalage to an overlord, which in\r\nthe different countries of Europe did not cease to exist with the Middle\r\nAges. For hundreds of years they had lived obscurely near Northampton.\r\nThey had early joined the revolt against the papal authority. For\r\ngenerations they were blacksmiths and husbandmen. Franklin's\r\ngreat-grandfather had been imprisoned for writing satirical verses about\r\nsome provincial magnate. Of the grandfather's four sons the eldest\r\nbecame a smith, but having some ingenuity and scholarly ability turned\r\nconveyancer, and was recognized as able and public-spirited. The other\r\nthree were dyers. Franklin's father Josiah and his Uncle Benjamin were\r\nnonconformists, and conceived the plan of emigrating to America in\r\norder to enjoy their way of religion with freedom.\r\n\r\nBenjamin, born at Boston, twenty-one years after his father's\r\nemigration, was the youngest of ten sons, all of whom were eventually\r\napprenticed to trades. The father was a man of sound judgment who\r\nencouraged sensible conversation in his home. Uncle Benjamin, who did\r\nnot emigrate till much later, showed interest in his precocious\r\nnamesake. Both he and the maternal grandfather expressed in verse\r\ndislike of war and intolerance, the one with considerable literary\r\nskill, the other with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom,\r\nas his grandson said.\r\n\r\nBenjamin was intended as a tithe to the Church, but the plan was\r\nabandoned because of lack of means to send him to college. After one\r\nyear at the Latin Grammar School, and one year at an arithmetic and\r\nwriting school, for better or worse, his education of that sort ceased;\r\nand at the age of ten he began to assist in his father's occupation, now\r\nthat of tallow-chandler and soap-boiler. He wished to go to sea, and\r\ngave indications of leadership and enterprise. His father took him to\r\nvisit the shops of joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, cutlers, and\r\nother artisans, thus stimulating in him a delight in handicraft.\r\nFinally, because of a bookish turn he had been exhibiting, the boy was\r\nbound apprentice to his brother James, who about 1720 began to publish\r\nthe _New England Courant_, the fourth newspaper to be established in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAmong the books early read by Benjamin Franklin were _The Pilgrim's\r\nProgress_, certain historical collections, a book on navigation, works\r\nof Protestant controversy, Plutarch's _Lives_, filled with the spirit\r\nof Greek freedom, Dr. Mather's _Bonifacius_, and Defoe's _Essay on\r\nProjects_. The last two seemed to give him a way of thinking, to adopt\r\nFranklin's phraseology, that had an influence on some of the principal\r\nevents of his life. Defoe, an ardent nonconformist, educated in one of\r\nthe Academies (established on Milton's model) and especially trained in\r\nEnglish and current history, advocated among other projects a military\r\nacademy, an academy for improving the vernacular, and an academy for\r\nwomen. He thought it barbarous that a civilized and Christian country\r\nshould deny the advantages of learning to women. They should be brought\r\nto read books and especially history. Defoe could not think that God\r\nAlmighty had made women so glorious, with souls capable of the same\r\naccomplishments with men, and all to be only stewards of our houses,\r\ncooks, and slaves.\r\n\r\nBenjamin still had a hankering for the sea, but he recognized in the\r\nprinting-office and access to books other means of escape from the\r\nnarrowness of the Boston of 1720. Between him and another bookish boy,\r\nJohn Collins, arose an argument in reference to the education of women.\r\nThe argument took the form of correspondence. Josiah Franklin's\r\njudicious criticism led Benjamin to undertake the well-known plan of\r\ndeveloping his literary style.\r\n\r\nPassing over his reading of the _Spectator_, however, it is remarkable\r\nhow soon his mind sought out and assimilated its appropriate\r\nnourishment, Locke's _Essay on the Human Understanding_, which began the\r\nmodern epoch in psychology; the _Port Royal Logic_, prepared by that\r\nbrilliant group of noble Catholics about Pascal; the works of Locke's\r\ndisciple Collins, whose _Discourse on Freethinking_ appeared in 1713;\r\nthe ethical writings (1708-1713) of Shaftesbury, who defended liberty\r\nand justice, and detested all persecution. A few pages of translation of\r\nXenophon's _Memorabilia_ gave him a hint as to Socrates' manner of\r\ndiscussion, and he made it his own, and avoided dogmatism.\r\n\r\nFranklin rapidly became expert as a printer, and early contributed\r\narticles to the paper. His brother, however, to whom he had been bound\r\napprentice for a period of nine years, humiliated and beat him. Benjamin\r\nthought that the harsh and tyrannical treatment he received at this time\r\nwas the means of impressing him with that aversion to arbitrary power\r\nthat stuck to him through his whole life. He had a strong desire to\r\nescape from his bondage, and, after five years of servitude, found the\r\nopportunity. James Franklin, on account of some offensive utterances in\r\nthe _New England Courant_, was summoned before the Council and sent to\r\njail for one month, during which time Benjamin, in charge of the paper,\r\ntook the side of his brother and made bold to give the rulers some rubs.\r\nLater, James was forbidden to publish the paper without submitting to\r\nthe supervision of the Secretary of the Province. To evade the\r\ndifficulty the _New England Courant_ was published in Benjamin's name,\r\nJames announcing his own retirement. In fear that this subterfuge might\r\nbe challenged, he gave Benjamin a discharge of his indentures, but at\r\nthe same time signed with him a new secret contract. Fresh quarrels\r\narose between the brothers, however, and Benjamin, knowing that the\r\neditor dared not plead before court the second contract, took upon\r\nhimself to assert his freedom, a step which he later regretted as not\r\ndictated by the highest principle.\r\n\r\nUnable to find other employment in Boston, condemned by his father's\r\njudgment in the matter of the contract, somewhat under public criticism\r\nalso for his satirical vein and heterodoxy, Franklin determined to try\r\nhis fortunes elsewhere. Thus, at the age of seventeen he made his escape\r\nfrom Boston.\r\n\r\nUnable to find work in New York, he arrived after some difficulties in\r\nPhiladelphia in October, 1723. He had brought no recommendations from\r\nBoston; his supply of money was reduced to one Dutch dollar and a\r\nshilling in copper. But he that hath a Trade hath an Estate (as Poor\r\nRichard says). His capital was his industry, his skill as a printer, his\r\ngood-will, his shrewd powers of observation, his knowledge of books, and\r\nability to write. Franklin, recognized as a promising young man by the\r\nGovernor, Sir William Keith, as previously by Governor Burnet of New\r\nYork, had a growing sense of personal freedom and self-reliance.\r\n\r\nBut increased freedom for those who deserve it means increased\r\nresponsibility; for it implies the possibility of error. Franklin,\r\nintent above all on the wise conduct of life, was deeply perturbed in\r\nhis nineteenth and twentieth years by a premature engagement, in which\r\nhis ever-passionate nature had involved him, by his failure to pay over\r\nmoney collected for a friend, and by the unsettled state of his\r\nreligious and ethical beliefs. Encouraged by Keith to purchase the\r\nequipment for an independent printing-office, Franklin, though unable to\r\ngain his father's support for the project, went to London (for the\r\nostensible purpose of selecting the stock) at the close of the year\r\n1724.\r\n\r\nHe remained in London a year and a half, working in two of the leading\r\nprinting establishments of the metropolis, where his skill and\r\nreliability were soon prized. He found the English artisans of that time\r\ngreat guzzlers of beer, and influenced some of his co-workers to adopt\r\nhis own more abstinent and hygienic habits of eating and drinking. About\r\nthis time a book, _Religion of Nature Delineated_, by William Wollaston\r\n(great-grandfather of the scientist Wollaston) so roused Franklin's\r\nopposition that he wrote a reply, which he printed in pamphlet form\r\nbefore leaving London in 1726, and the composition of which he\r\nafterwards regretted.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Philadelphia in the employ of a Quaker merchant, on whose\r\ndeath he resumed work as printer under his former employer. He was given\r\ncontrol of the office, undertook to make his own type, contrived a\r\ncopper-plate press, the first in America, and printed paper money for\r\nNew Jersey. The substance of some lectures in defense of Christianity,\r\nin courses endowed by the will of Robert Boyle, made Franklin a Deist.\r\nAt the same time his views on moral questions were clarified, and he\r\ncame to recognize that truth, sincerity, and integrity were of the\r\nutmost importance to the felicity of life. What he had attained by his\r\nown independent thought rendered him ultimately more careful rather than\r\nmore reckless. He now set value on his own character, and resolved to\r\npreserve it.\r\n\r\nIn 1727, still only twenty-one, he drew together a number of young men\r\nin a sort of club, called the \"Junto,\" for mutual benefit in business\r\nand for the discussion of morals, politics, and natural philosophy. They\r\nprofessed tolerance, benevolence, love of truth. They discussed the\r\neffect on business of the issue of paper money, various natural\r\nphenomena, and kept a sharp look-out for any encroachment on the rights\r\nof the people. It is not unnatural to find that in a year or two (1729),\r\nafter Franklin and a friend had established a printing business of their\r\nown and acquired the _Pennsylvania Gazette_, the young politician\r\nchampioned the cause of the Massachusetts Assembly against the claims\r\nfirst put forward by Governor Burnet, and that he used spirited language\r\nreferring to America as a nation and clime foreign to England.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 Franklin bought out his partner, and in the same year published\r\ndialogues in the Socratic manner in reference to virtue and pleasure,\r\nwhich show a rapid development in his general views. About the same time\r\nhe married, restored the money that had long been owing, and formulated\r\nhis ethical code and religious creed. He began in 1732 the _Poor Richard\r\nAlmanacks_, said to offer in their homely wisdom the best course in\r\nexistence in practical morals.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1729 Franklin had published a pamphlet on _Paper Currency_.\r\nIt was a well-reasoned discussion on the relation of the issue of paper\r\ncurrency to rate of interest, land values, manufactures, population, and\r\nwages. The want of money discouraged laboring and handicraftsmen. One\r\nmust consider the nature and value of money in general. This essay\r\naccomplished its purpose in the Assembly. It was the first of those\r\ncontributions which, arising from Franklin's consideration of the social\r\nand industrial circumstances of the times, gained for him recognition as\r\nthe first American economist. It was in the same spirit that in 1751 he\r\ndiscussed the question of population after the passage of the British\r\nAct forbidding the erection or the operation of iron or steel mills in\r\nthe colonies. Science for Franklin was no extraneous interest; he was\r\nall of a piece, and it was as a citizen of Philadelphia he wrote those\r\nessays that commanded the attention of Adam Smith, Malthus, and Turgot.\r\n\r\nIn 1731 he was instrumental in founding the first of those public\r\nlibraries, which (along with a free press) have made American tradesmen\r\nand farmers as intelligent, in Franklin's judgment, as most gentlemen\r\nfrom other countries, and contributed to the spirit with which they\r\ndefended their liberties. The diffusion of knowledge became so general\r\nin the colonies that in 1766 Franklin was able to tell the English\r\nlegislators that the seeds of liberty were universally found there and\r\nthat nothing could eradicate them. Franklin became clerk of the General\r\nAssembly and postmaster, improved the paving and lighting of the city\r\nstreets, and established the first fire brigade and the first police\r\nforce in America. Then in 1743 in the same spirit of public beneficence\r\nFranklin put forth his _Proposal for Promoting Useful Knowledge among\r\nthe British Plantations in America_. It outlines his plan for the\r\nestablishment of the American Philosophical Society. Correspondence had\r\nalready been established with the Royal Society of London. It is not\r\ndifficult to see in Franklin the same spirit that had animated Hartlib,\r\nBoyle, Petty,[2] Wilkins, and their friends one hundred years before. In\r\nfact, Franklin was the embodiment of that union of scientific ideas and\r\npractical skill in the industries that with them was merely a pious\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nIn this same year of 1743 an eclipse of the moon, which could not be\r\nseen at Philadelphia on account of a northeast storm, was yet visible at\r\nBoston, where the storm came, as Franklin learned from his brother,\r\nabout an hour after the time of observation. Franklin, who knew\r\nsomething of fireplaces, explained the matter thus: \"When I have a fire\r\nin my chimney, there is a current of air constantly flowing from the\r\ndoor to the chimney, but the beginning of the motion was at the\r\nchimney.\" So in a mill-race, water stopped by a gate is like air in a\r\ncalm. When the gate is raised, the water moves forward, but the motion,\r\nso to speak, runs backward. Thus the principle was established in\r\nmeteorology that northeast storms arise to the southwest.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Franklin was not oblivious of the practical value of this\r\ndiscovery, for, as Sir Humphry Davy remarked, he in no instance\r\nexhibited that false dignity, by which philosophy is kept aloof from\r\ncommon applications. In fact, Franklin was rather apologetic in\r\nreference to the magic squares and circles, with which he sometimes\r\namused his leisure, as a sort of ingenious trifling. At the very time\r\nthat the question of the propagation of storms arose in his mind he had\r\ncontrived the Pennsylvania fireplace, which was to achieve cheap,\r\nadequate, and uniform heating for American homes. His aspiration was for\r\na free people, well sheltered, well fed, well clad, well instructed.\r\n\r\nIn 1747 Franklin made what is generally considered his chief\r\ncontribution to science. One of his correspondents, Collinson (a Fellow\r\nof the Royal Society and a botanist interested in useful plants, through\r\nwhom the vine was introduced into Virginia), had sent to the Library\r\nCompany at Philadelphia one of the recently invented Leyden jars with\r\ninstructions for its use. Franklin, who had already seen similar\r\napparatus at Boston, and his friends, set to work experimenting. For\r\nmonths he had leisure for nothing else. In this sort of activity he had\r\na spontaneous and irrepressible delight. By March, 1747, they felt that\r\nthey had made discoveries, and in July, and subsequently, Franklin\r\nreported results to Collinson. He had observed that a pointed rod\r\nbrought near the jar was much more efficacious than a blunt rod in\r\ndrawing off the charge; also that if a pointed rod were attached to the\r\njar, the charge would be thrown off, and accumulation of charge\r\nprevented. Franklin, moreover, found that the nature of the charges on\r\nthe inside and on the outside of the glass was different. He spoke of\r\none as plus and the other as minus. Again, \"We say _B_ (and bodies\r\nlike-circumstanced) is electricized positively; _A_ negatively.\" Dufay\r\nhad recognized two sorts of electricity, obtained by rubbing a glass\r\nrod and a stick of resin, and had spoken of them as vitreous and\r\nresinous. For Franklin electricity was a single subtle fluid, and\r\nelectrical manifestations were owing to the degree of its presence, to\r\ninterruption or restoration of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nHis mind, however, was bent on the use, the applications, the\r\ninventions, to follow. He contrived an \"electric jack driven by two\r\nLeyden jars and capable of carrying a large fowl with a motion fit for\r\nroasting before a fire.\" He also succeeded in driving an \"automatic\"\r\nwheel by electricity, but he regretted not being able to turn his\r\ndiscoveries to greater account.\r\n\r\nHe thought later--in 1748--that there were many points of similarity\r\nbetween lightning and the spark from a Leyden jar, and suggested an\r\nexperiment to test the identity of their natures. The suggestion was\r\nacted upon at Marly in France. An iron rod about forty feet long and\r\nsharp at the end was placed upright in the hope of drawing electricity\r\nfrom the storm-clouds. A man was instructed to watch for storm-clouds,\r\nand to touch a brass wire, attached to a glass bottle, to the rod. The\r\nconditions seemed favorable May 10, 1752; sparks between the wire and\r\nrod and a \"sulphurous\" odor were perceived (the manifestations of\r\nwrath!). Franklin's well-known kite experiment followed. In 1753 he\r\nreceived from the Royal Society a medal for the identification and\r\ncontrol of the forces of lightning; subsequently he was elected Fellow,\r\nbecame a member of the Académie des Sciences, and of other learned\r\nbodies. By 1782 there were as many as four hundred lightning rods in\r\nuse in Philadelphia alone, though some conservative people regarded\r\ntheir employment as impious. Franklin's good-will, clearness of\r\nconception, and common sense triumphed everywhere.\r\n\r\nOne has only to recall that in 1753 he (along with Hunter) was in charge\r\nof the postal service of the colonies, that in 1754 as delegate to the\r\nAlbany Convention he drew up the first plan for colonial union, and that\r\nin the following year he furnished Braddock with transportation for the\r\nexpedition against Fort Duquesne, to realize the distractions amid which\r\nhe pursued science. In 1748 he had sold his printing establishment with\r\nthe purpose of devoting himself to physical experiment, but the\r\nconditions of the time saved him from specialization.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 he drew up proposals relating to the education of youth in\r\nPennsylvania, which led, two years later, to the establishment of the\r\nfirst American Academy. His plan was so advanced, so democratic,\r\nspringing as it did from his own experience, that no secondary school\r\nhas yet taken full advantage of its wisdom. The school, chartered in\r\n1753, grew ultimately into the University of Pennsylvania. Moreover, it\r\nbecame the prototype of thousands of schools, which departed from the\r\nLatin Grammar Schools and the Colleges by the introduction of the\r\nsciences and practical studies into the curriculum.\r\n\r\nFranklin deserves mention not only in connection with economics,\r\nmeteorology, practical ethics, electricity, and pedagogy; his biographer\r\nenumerates nineteen sciences to which he made original contributions or\r\nwhich he advanced by intelligent criticism. In medicine he invented\r\nbifocal lenses and founded the first American public hospital; in\r\nnavigation he studied the Gulf Stream and waterspouts, and suggested the\r\nuse of oil in storms and the construction of ships with water-tight\r\ncompartments; in agriculture he experimented with plaster of Paris as a\r\nfertilizer and introduced in America the use of rhubarb; in chemistry he\r\naided Priestley's experiments by information in reference to marsh gas.\r\nHe foresaw the employment of air craft in war. Thinking the English slow\r\nto take up the interest in balloons, he wrote that we should not suffer\r\npride to prevent our progress in science. Pride that dines on vanity\r\nsups on contempt, as Poor Richard says. When it was mentioned in his\r\npresence that birds fly in inclined planes, he launched a half sheet of\r\npaper to indicate that his previous observations had prepared his mind\r\nto respond readily to the discovery. His quickness and versatility made\r\nhim sought after by the best intellects of Europe.\r\n\r\nI pass over his analysis of mesmerism, his conception of light as\r\ndependent (like lightning) on a subtle fluid, his experiments with\r\ncolored cloths, his view of the nature of epidemic colds, interest in\r\ninoculation for smallpox, in ventilation, vegetarianism, a stove to\r\nconsume its own smoke, the steamboat, and his own inventions (clock,\r\nharmonica, etc.), for which he refused to take out patents.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the many examples of his scientific acumen I select one\r\nmore. As early as 1747 he had been interested in geology and had seen\r\nspecimens of the fossil remains of marine shells from the strata of the\r\nhighest parts of the Alleghany Mountains. Later he stated that either\r\nthe sea had once stood at a higher level, or that these strata had been\r\nraised by the force of earthquakes. Such convulsions of nature are not\r\nwholly injurious, since, by bringing a great number of strata of\r\ndifferent kinds today, they have rendered the earth more fit for use,\r\nmore capable of being to mankind a convenient and comfortable\r\nhabitation. He thought it unlikely that a great _bouleversement_ should\r\nhappen if the earth were solid to the center. Rather the surface of the\r\nglobe was a shell resting on a fluid of very great specific gravity, and\r\nwas thus capable of being broken and disordered by violent movement. As\r\nlate as 1788 Franklin wrote his queries and conjectures relating to\r\nmagnetism and the theory of the earth. Did the earth become magnetic by\r\nthe development of iron ore? Is not magnetism rather interplanetary and\r\ninterstellar? May not the near passing of a comet of greater magnetic\r\nforce than the earth have been a means of changing its poles and thereby\r\nwrecking and deranging its surface, and raising and depressing the sea\r\nlevel?\r\n\r\nWe are not here directly concerned with his political career, in his\r\nchecking of governors and proprietaries, in his activities as the\r\ngreatest of American diplomats, as the signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, of the Treaty of Versailles, and of the American\r\nConstitution, nor as the president of the Supreme Executive Council of\r\nPennsylvania in his eightieth, eighty-first, and eighty-second years.\r\nWhen he was eighty-four, as president of the Society for Promoting the\r\nAbolition of Slavery, he signed a petition to Congress against that\r\natrocious debasement of human nature, and six weeks later, within a few\r\nweeks of his death, defended the petition with his accustomed vigor,\r\nhumor, wisdom, and ardent love of liberty. Turgot wittily summed up\r\nFranklin's career by saying that he had snatched the lightning from the\r\nheavens and the scepter from the hands of tyrants (_eripuit cœlo fulmen\r\nsceptrumque tyrannis_); for both his political and scientific activities\r\nsprang from the same impelling emotion--hatred of the exercise of\r\narbitrary power and desire for human welfare. It is no wonder that the\r\nFrench National Assembly, promulgators of the Rights of Man, paused in\r\ntheir labors to pay homage to the simple citizen, who, representing\r\nAmerica in Paris from his seventy-first till his eightieth year, had by\r\nhis wisdom and urbanity illustrated the best fruits of an instructed\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n American Philosophical Society, _Record of the Celebration of the Two\r\n   Hundredth Anniversary of the Birth of Benjamin Franklin_.\r\n\r\n S.

In fact, it was a question very vigorously disputed what part\r\nthe internal or volcanic fire played in the formation and modification\r\nof rock masses. Divergent views were represented by men who had come to\r\nthe study of geology with varying aims and diverse scientific schooling,\r\nand the advance of the science of the earth's crust was owing in no\r\nsmall measure to the interaction of the different sciences which the\r\nexponents of the various points of view brought to bear.\r\n\r\nAbraham Gottlob Werner (1750-1817) was the most conspicuous and\r\ninfluential champion on the side of the argument opposed to the\r\nacceptance of volcanic action as one of the chief causes of geologic\r\nformations. He was born in Saxony and came of a family which had engaged\r\nfor three hundred years in mining and metal working. They were active in\r\nSaxony when George Agricola prepared his famous works on metallurgy and\r\nmineralogy inspired by the traditional wisdom of the local iron\r\nindustry. Werner's father was an overseer of iron-works, and furnished\r\nhis son with mineral specimens as playthings before the child could\r\npronounce their names. In 1769 Werner was invited to attend the newly\r\nfounded Bergakademie (School of Mines) at Freiberg. Three years later he\r\nwent to the University of Leipzig, but, true to his first enthusiasm,\r\nwrote in 1774 concerning the outward characteristics of minerals (_Von\r\nden äusserlichen Kennzeichen der Fossilien_). The next year he was\r\nrecalled to Freiberg as teacher of mineralogy and curator of\r\ncollections. He was intent on classification, and might be compared in\r\nthat respect with the naturalist Buffon, or the botanist Linnæus. He\r\nknew that chemistry afforded a surer, but slower, procedure; his was a\r\npractical, intuitive, field method. He observed the color, the hardness,\r\nweight, fracture of minerals, and experienced the joy the youthful mind\r\nfeels in rapid identification. He translated Cronstedt's book on\r\nmineralogy descriptive of the practical blow-pipe tests. After the\r\nidentification of minerals, Werner was interested in their discovery,\r\nthe location of deposits, their geographical distribution, and the\r\nrelative positions of different kinds of rocks, especially the constant\r\njuxtaposition or superposition of one stratum in relation to another.\r\n\r\nWerner was an eloquent, systematic teacher with great charm of manner.\r\nHe kept in mind the practical purposes of mining, and soon people\r\nflocked to Freiberg to hear him from all the quarters of Europe. He had\r\nbefore long disciples in every land. He saw all phenomena from the\r\nstandpoint of the geologist. He knew the medicinal, as well as the\r\neconomic, value of minerals. He knew the relation of the soil to the\r\nrocks, and the effects of both on racial characteristics. Building-stone\r\ndetermines style of architecture. Mountains and river-courses have\r\nbearing on military tactics. He turned his linguistic knowledge to\r\naccount and furnished geology with a definite nomenclature. Alex. v.\r\nHumboldt, Robert Jameson, D'Aubuisson, Weiss (the teacher of Froebel),\r\nwere among his students. Crystallography and mineralogy became the\r\nfashion. Goethe was among the enthusiasts, and philosophers like\r\nSchelling, under the spell of the new science, almost deified the\r\nphysical universe.\r\n\r\nWerner considered all rocks as having originated by crystallization,\r\neither chemical or mechanical, from an aqueous solution--a universal\r\nprimitive ocean. He was a Neptunist, as opposed to the Vulcanists or\r\nPlutonists, who believed in the existence of a central fiery mass.\r\nWerner thought that the earth showed universal strata like the layers of\r\nan onion, the mountains being formed by erosion, subsidence, cavings-in.\r\nIn his judgment granite was a primitive rock formed previous to animal\r\nand vegetable life (hence without organic remains) by chemical\r\nprecipitation. Silicious slate was formed later by mechanical\r\ncrystallization. At this period organized fossils first appear.\r\nSedimentary rocks, like old red sandstone, and, according to Werner,\r\nbasalt, are in a third class. Drift, sand, rubble, boulders, come next;\r\nand finally volcanic products, like lava, ashes, pumice. He was quite\r\npositive that all basalt was of aqueous origin and of quite recent\r\nformation. This part of his teaching was soon challenged. He was truer\r\nto his own essential purposes in writing a valuable treatise on\r\nmetalliferous veins (_Die Neue Theorie der Erzgänge_), but even there\r\nhis general views are apparent, for he holds that veins are clefts\r\nfilled in from above by crystallization from aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nBefore Werner had begun his teaching career at Freiberg, Desmarest, the\r\nFrench geologist, had made a special study of the basalts of Auvergne.\r\nAs a mathematician he was able to make a trigonometrical survey of that\r\ndistrict, and constructed a map showing the craters of volcanoes of\r\ndifferent ages, the streams of lava following the river courses, and the\r\nrelation of basalt to lava, scoria, ashes, and other recognized products\r\nof volcanic action. In 1788 he was made inspector-general of French\r\nmanufactures, later superintendent of the porcelain works at Sèvres. He\r\nlived to the age of ninety, and whenever Neptunists would try to draw\r\nhim into argument, the old man would simply say, \"Go and see.\"\r\n\r\nJames Hutton (1726-1797), the illustrious Scotch geologist, had\r\nsomething of the same aversion to speculation that did not rest on\r\nevidence; though he was eminently a philosopher in the strictest sense\r\nof the word, as his three quarto volumes on the _Principles of\r\nKnowledge_ bear witness. Hutton was well trained at Edinburgh in the\r\nHigh School and University. In a lecture on logic an illustrative\r\nreference to _aqua regia_ turned his mind to the study of chemistry. He\r\nengaged in experiments, and ultimately made a fortune by a process for\r\nthe manufacture of sal ammoniac from coal-soot. In the mean time he\r\nstudied medicine at Edinburgh, Paris, and Leyden, and continued the\r\npursuit of chemistry. Then, having inherited land in Berwickshire, he\r\nstudied husbandry in Norfolk and took interest in the surface of the\r\nland and water-courses; later he pursued these studies in Flanders.\r\nDuring years of highly successful farming, during which Hutton\r\nintroduced new methods in Berwickshire, he was interested in\r\nmeteorology, and in geology as related to soils. In 1768, financially\r\nindependent, Dr. Hutton retired to reside in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nHe was very genial and sociable and was in close association with Adam\r\nSmith, the economist, and with Black, known in the history of chemistry\r\nin connection with carbonic acid, latent heat, and experiments in\r\nmagnesia, quicklime, and other alkaline substances (1777). Playfair,\r\nprofessor of mathematics, and later of natural philosophy, was Hutton's\r\ndisciple and intimate friend. In the distinguished company of the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh, established in 1782, the founder of dynamic\r\ngeology was stimulated by these and other distinguished men like William\r\nRobertson, Lord Kames, and Watt. The first volume of the _Transactions_\r\ncontains his _Theory of Rains_, and the first statement of his famous\r\n_Theory of the Earth_. He was very broad-minded and enthusiastic and\r\nwould rejoice in Watt's improvements of the steam engine or Cook's\r\ndiscoveries in the South Pacific. Without emphasizing his indebtedness\r\nto Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, physicist, geologist, meteorologist,\r\nbotanist, who gave to Europeans an appreciation of the sublime in\r\nnature, nor dwelling further on the range of Hutton's studies in\r\nlanguage, general physics, etc., it is already made evident that his\r\nmind was such as to afford comprehensiveness of view.\r\n\r\nHe expressed the wish to induce men who had sufficient knowledge of the\r\nparticular branches of science, to employ their acquired talents in\r\npromoting general science, or knowledge of the great system, where ends\r\nand means are wisely adjusted in the constitution of the material\r\nuniverse. Philosophy, he says, is surely the ultimate end of human\r\nknowledge, or the object at which all sciences properly must aim.\r\nSciences no doubt should promote the arts of life; but, he proceeds,\r\nwhat are all the arts of life, or all the enjoyments of mere animal\r\nnature, compared with the art of human happiness, gained by education\r\nand brought to perfection by philosophy? Man must learn to know himself;\r\nhe must see his station among created things; he must become a moral\r\nagent. But it is only by studying things in general that he may arrive\r\nat this perfection of his nature. \"To philosophize, therefore, without\r\nproper science, is in vain; although it is not vain to pursue science,\r\nwithout proceeding to philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1785 Dr. Hutton presented his _Theory of the Earth_\r\nin ninety-six pages of perfectly lucid English. The globe is studied as\r\na machine adapted to a certain end, namely, to provide a habitable world\r\nfor plants, for animals, and, above all, for intellectual beings capable\r\nof the contemplation and the appreciation of order and harmony. Hutton's\r\ntheory might be made plain by drawing an analogy between geological and\r\nmeteorological activities. The rain descends on the earth; streams and\r\nrivers bear it to the sea; the aqueous vapors, drawn from the sea,\r\nsupply the clouds, and the circuit is complete. Similarly, the soil is\r\nformed from the overhanging mountains; it is washed as sediment into\r\nthe sea; it is elevated, after consolidation, into the overhanging\r\nmountains. The earth is more than a mechanism, it is an organism that\r\nrepairs and restores itself in perpetuity. Thus Hutton explained the\r\ncomposition, dissolution, and restoration of land upon the globe on a\r\ngeneral principle, even as Newton had brought a mass of details under\r\nthe single law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nAgain, as Newton had widened man's conception of space, so Hutton (and\r\nBuffon) enlarged his conception of time. For the geologist did not\r\nundertake to explain the _origin_ of things; he found no vestige of a\r\nbeginning,--no prospect of an end; and at the same time he conjured up\r\nno hypothetical causes, no catastrophes, or sudden convulsions of\r\nnature; neither did he (like Werner) believe that phenomena now present,\r\nwere once absent; but he undertook to explain all geological change by\r\nprocesses in action now as heretofore. Countless ages were requisite to\r\nform the soil of our smiling valleys, but \"Time, which measures\r\neverything in our _idea_, and is often deficient to our schemes, is to\r\nnature endless and as nothing.\" The calcareous remains of marine animals\r\nin the solid body of the earth bear witness of a period to which no\r\nother species of chronology is able to remount.\r\n\r\nHutton's imagination, on the basis of what can be observed to-day,\r\npictured the chemical and mechanical disintegration of the rocks; and\r\nsaw ice-streams bearing huge granite boulders from the declivities of\r\nprimitive and more gigantic Alps. He believed (as Desmarest) that\r\nrivulets and rivers have constructed, and are constructing, their own\r\nvalley systems, and that the denudation ever in progress would be\r\neventually fatal to the sustenance of plant and animal and man, if the\r\nearth were not a renewable organism, in which repair is correlative with\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nAll strata are sedimentary, consolidated at the bottom of the sea by the\r\npressure of the water and by subterranean heat. How are strata raised\r\nfrom the ocean bed? By the same subterranean force that helped\r\nconsolidate them. The power of heat for the expansion of bodies, is,\r\nsays Hutton (possibly having in mind the steam engine), so far as we\r\nknow, unlimited. We see liquid stone pouring from the crater of a lofty\r\nvolcano and casting huge rocks into mid-air, and yet find it difficult\r\nto believe that Vesuvius and Etna themselves have been formed by\r\nvolcanic action. The interior of the planet may be a fluid mass, melted,\r\nbut unchanged by the action of heat. The volcanoes are spiracles or\r\nsafety-valves, and are widely distributed on the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nHutton believed that basalt, and the whinstones generally, are of\r\nigneous origin. Moreover, he put granite in the same category, and\r\nbelieved it had been injected, as also metalliferous veins, in liquid\r\nstate into the stratified rocks. If his supposition were correct, then\r\ngranite would be found sending out veins from its large masses to pierce\r\nthe stratified rocks and to crop out where stratum meets stratum. His\r\nconjecture was corroborated at Glen Tilt (and in the island of Arran).\r\nHutton was so elated at the verification of his view that the Scotch\r\nguides thought he had struck gold, or silver at the very least. In the\r\nbed of the river Tilt he could see at six points within half a mile\r\npowerful veins of red granite piercing the black micaceous schist and\r\ngiving every indication of having been intruded from beneath, with great\r\nviolence, into the earlier formation.\r\n\r\nHutton felt confirmed in his view that in nature there is wisdom,\r\nsystem, and consistency. Even the volcano and earthquake, instead of\r\nbeing accidents, or arbitrary manifestations of divine wrath, are part\r\nof the economy of nature, and the best clue we have to the stupendous\r\nforce necessary to heave up the strata, inject veins of metals and\r\nigneous rocks, and insure a succession of habitable worlds.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 Dr. Hutton published a more elaborate statement of his theory in\r\ntwo volumes. In 1802 Playfair printed _Illustrations of the Huttonian\r\nTheory_, a simplification, having, naturally, little originality. Before\r\nhis death in 1797 Hutton devoted his time to reading new volumes by\r\nSaussure on the Alps, and to preparing a book on _The Elements of\r\nAgriculture_.\r\n\r\nSir James Hall of Dunglass was a reluctant convert to Hutton's system of\r\ngeology. Three arguments against the Huttonian hypothesis gave him cause\r\nfor doubt. Would not matter solidifying after fusion form a glass, a\r\nvitreous, rather than a crystalline product? Why do basalts, whinstones,\r\nand other supposedly volcanic rocks differ so much in structure from\r\nlava? How can marble and other limestones have been _fused_, seeing that\r\nthey are readily calcined by heat? Hutton thought that the compression\r\nunder which the subterranean heat had been applied was a factor in the\r\nsolution of these problems. He was encouraged in this view by Black,\r\nwho, as already implied, had made a special study of limestone and had\r\ndemonstrated that lime acquires its causticity through the expulsion of\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\nHall conjectured in addition that the rate at which the fused mass\r\ncooled might have some bearing on the structure of igneous rocks. An\r\naccident in the Leith glass works strengthened the probability of his\r\nconjecture and encouraged him to experiment. A pot of green bottle-glass\r\nhad been allowed to cool slowly with the result that it had a stony,\r\nrather than a vitreous structure. Hall experimenting with glass could\r\nsecure either structure at will by cooling rapidly or slowly, and that\r\nwith the same specimen.\r\n\r\nHe later enclosed some fragments of whinstone in a black-lead crucible\r\nand subjected it to intense heat in the reverberating furnace of an iron\r\nfoundry. (He was in consultation with Mr. Wedgwood on the scale of heat,\r\nand with Dr. Hope and Dr. Kennedy, chemists.) After boiling, and then\r\ncooling rapidly, the contents of the crucible proved a black glass. Hall\r\nrepeated the experiment, and cooled more slowly. The result was an\r\nintermediate substance, neither glass nor whinstone--a sort of slag.\r\nAgain he heated the crucible in the furnace, and removed quickly to an\r\nopen fire, which was maintained some hours and then permitted to die\r\nout. The result in this case was a perfect whinstone. Similar results\r\nwere obtained with regular basalts and different specimens of igneous\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nHall next experimented with lava from Vesuvius, Etna, Iceland, and\r\nelsewhere, and found that it behaved like whinstone. Dr. Kennedy by\r\ncareful chemical analysis confirmed Hall's judgment of the similarity\r\nof these two igneous products.\r\n\r\nStill later Hall introduced chalk and powdered limestone into porcelain\r\ntubes, gun barrels, and tubes bored in solid iron, which he sealed and\r\nbrought to very high temperatures. He obtained, by fusion, a crystalline\r\ncarbonate resembling marble. Under the high pressure in the tube the\r\ncarbonic acid was retained. By these and other experiments this doubting\r\ndisciple confirmed Hutton's theory, and became one of the great founders\r\nof experimental geology.\r\n\r\nIt remained for William Smith (1769-1839), surveyor and engineer, to\r\ndevelop that species of chronology that Hutton had ascribed to organic\r\nremains in the solid strata, to arrange these strata in the order of\r\ntime, and thus to become the founder of historic geology. For this task\r\nhis early education might at first glance seem inadequate. His only\r\nschooling was received in an elementary institution in Oxfordshire. He\r\nmanaged, however, to acquire some knowledge of geometry, and at eighteen\r\nentered, as assistant, a surveyor's office. He never attained any\r\nliterary facility, and was always more successful in conveying his\r\nobservations by maps, drawings, and conversation than by books.\r\n\r\nHowever, he early began his collection of minerals and observed the\r\nrelation of the soil and the vegetation to the underlying rocks. Engaged\r\nat the age of twenty-four in taking levelings for a canal, he noticed\r\nthat the strata were not exactly horizontal, but dipped to the east\r\n\"like slices of bread and butter,\" a phenomenon he considered of\r\nscientific significance. In connection with his calling he had an\r\nopportunity of traveling to the north of England and so extended the\r\nrange of his observation, always exceptionally alert. For six years he\r\nwas engaged, as engineer, in the construction of the Somerset Coal\r\nCanal, where he enlarged and turned to practical account his knowledge\r\nof strata.\r\n\r\nCollectors of fossils (as Lamarck afterwards called organic remains)\r\nwere surprised to find Smith able to tell in what formation their\r\ndifferent specimens had been found, and still more when he enunciated\r\nthe view that \"whatever strata were to be found in any part of England\r\nthe same remains would be found in it and no other.\" Moreover, the same\r\norder of superposition was constant among the strata, as Werner, of whom\r\nSmith knew nothing, had indeed taught. Smith was able to dictate a\r\n_Tabular View of British Strata_ from coal to chalk with the\r\ncharacteristic fossils, establishing an order that was found to obtain\r\non the Continent of Europe as well as in Britain.\r\n\r\nHe constructed geological maps of Somerset and fourteen other English\r\ncounties, to which the attention of the Board of Agriculture was called.\r\nThey showed the surface outcrops of strata, and were intended to be of\r\nassistance in mining, roadmaking, canal construction, draining, and\r\nwater supply. It was at the time of William Smith's scientific\r\ndiscoveries that the public interest in canal transportation was at its\r\nheight in England, and his study of the strata was a direct outcome of\r\nhis professional activity. He called himself a mineral surveyor, and he\r\ntraveled many thousand miles yearly in connection with his calling and\r\nhis interest in the study of geology. In 1815 he completed an extensive\r\ngeological map of England, on which all subsequent geological maps have\r\nbeen modeled. It took into account the collieries, mines, canals,\r\nmarshes, fens, and the varieties of soil in relation to the substrata.\r\n\r\nLater (1816-1819) Smith published four volumes, _Strata Identified by\r\nOrganized Fossils_, which put on record some of his extensive\r\nobservations. His mind was practical and little given to speculation. It\r\ndoes not lie in our province here to trace his influence on Cuvier and\r\nother scientists, but to add his name as a surveyor and engineer to the\r\nrepresentatives of mineralogy, chemistry, physics, mathematics,\r\nphilosophy, and various industries and vocations, which contributed to\r\nthe early development of modern geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Sir A.

In the same century, however, other\r\nscientists and philosophers were attracted by these very problems which\r\nseemed not to promise immediate or demonstrative solution, and through\r\ntheir studies they arrived at conclusions which profoundly affected the\r\nscience, the ethics, and the religion of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nWhether religion be defined as a complex feeling of elation and\r\nhumility--a sacred fear--akin to the æsthetic sense of the sublime; or,\r\nas an intellectual recognition of some high powers which govern us\r\nbelow--of some author of all things, of some force social or cosmic\r\nwhich tends to righteousness; or, as the outcrop of the moral life\r\ntouched with light and radiant with enthusiasm; or, as partaking of the\r\nnature of all these: it cannot be denied that the eighteenth century\r\ncontributed to its clarification and formulation, especially through the\r\nefforts of the German philosopher, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Yet it is\r\nnot difficult to show that the philosophy of Kant and of those\r\nassociated with him was greatly influenced by the science of the time,\r\nand that, in fact, in his early life he was a scientist rather than a\r\nphilosopher in the stricter sense. His _General Natural History and\r\nTheory of the Heavens_, written at the age of thirty-one, enables us to\r\nfollow his transition from science to philosophy, and, more especially,\r\nto trace the influence of his theory of the origin of the heavenly\r\nbodies on his religious conceptions.\r\n\r\nFor part of this theory Kant was indebted to Thomas Wright of Durham\r\n(1711-1786). Wright was the son of a carpenter, became apprenticed to a\r\nwatchmaker, went to sea, later became an engraver, a maker of\r\nmathematical instruments, rose to affluence, wrote a book on navigation,\r\nand was offered a professorship of navigation in the Imperial Academy of\r\nSt. Petersburg. It was in 1750 that he published, in the form of nine\r\nletters, the work that stimulated the mind of Kant, _An Original Theory\r\nor New Hypothesis of the Universe_. The author thought that the\r\nrevelation of the structure of the heavens naturally tended to propagate\r\nthe principles of virtue and vindicate the laws of Providence. He\r\nregarded the universe as an infinity of worlds acted upon by an eternal\r\nAgent, and full of beings, tending through their various states to a\r\nfinal perfection. Who, conscious of this system, can avoid being filled\r\nwith a kind of enthusiastic ambition to contribute his atom toward the\r\ndue admiration of its great and Divine Author?\r\n\r\nWright discussed the nature of mathematical certainty and the various\r\ndegrees of moral probability proper for conjecture (thus pointing to a\r\ndistinction that ultimately became basal in the philosophy of Kant).\r\nWhen he claimed that the sun is a vast body of blazing matter, and that\r\nthe most distant star is also a sun surrounded by a system of planets,\r\nhe knew that he was reasoning by analogy and not enunciating what is\r\nimmediately demonstrable. Yet this multitude of worlds opens out to us\r\nan immense field of probation and an endless scene of hope to ground our\r\nexpectation of an ever future happiness upon, suitable to the native\r\ndignity of the awful Mind which made and comprehended it.\r\n\r\nThe most striking part of Wright's _Original Theory_ relates to the\r\nconstruction of the Milky Way, which he thought analogous in form to the\r\nrings of Saturn. From the center the arrangement of the systems and the\r\nharmony of the movements could be discerned, but our solar system\r\noccupies a section of the belt, and what we see of the creation gives\r\nbut a confused picture, unless by an effort of imagination we attain the\r\nright point of view. The various cloudy stars or light appearances are\r\nnothing but a dense accumulation of stars. What less than infinity can\r\ncircumscribe them, less than eternity comprehend them, or less than\r\nOmnipotence produce or support them? He passes on to a discussion of\r\ntime and space with regard to the known objects of immensity and\r\nduration, and in the ninth letter says that, granting the creation to be\r\ncircular or orbicular, we can suppose in the center of the whole an\r\nintelligent principle, the to-all-extending eye of Providence, or, if\r\nthe creation is real, and not merely ideal, a sphere of some sort.\r\nAround this the suns keep their orbits harmoniously, all apparent\r\nirregularities arising from our eccentric view. Moreover, space is\r\nsufficient for many such systems.\r\n\r\nKant resembled his predecessor in his recognition of the bearing on\r\nmoral and religious conceptions of the study of the heavens and also in\r\nhis treatment of many astronomical details, sometimes merely adopting,\r\nmore frequently developing or modifying, the teachings of Wright. He\r\nheld that the stars constitute a system just as much as do the planets\r\nof our solar system, and that other solar systems and other Milky Ways\r\nmay have been produced in the boundless fields of space. Indeed, he is\r\ninclined to identify with the latter systems the small luminous\r\nelliptical areas in the heavens reported by Maupertuis in 1742. Kant\r\nalso accepted Wright's conjecture of a central sun or globe and even\r\nmade selection of one of the stars to serve in that office, and taught\r\nthat the stars consist like our sun of a fiery mass. One cannot\r\ncontemplate the world-structure without recognizing the excellent\r\norderliness of its arrangement, and perceiving the sure indications of\r\nthe hand of God in the completeness of its relations. Reason, he says in\r\nthe _Allgemeine Naturgeschichte_, refuses to believe it the work of\r\nchance. It must have been planned by supreme wisdom and carried into\r\neffect by Omnipotence.\r\n\r\nKant was especially stimulated by the analogy between the Milky Way and\r\nthe rings of Saturn. He did not agree with Wright that they, or the\r\ncloudy areas, would prove to be stars or small satellites, but rather\r\nthat both consisted of vapor particles. Giving full scope to his\r\nimagination, he asks if the earth as well as Saturn may not have been\r\nsurrounded by a ring. Might not this ring explain the supercelestial\r\nwaters that gave such cause for ingenuity to the medieval writers? Not\r\nonly so, but, had such a vaporous ring broken and been precipitated to\r\nthe earth, it would have caused a prolonged Deluge, and the subsequent\r\nrainbow in the heavens might very well have been interpreted as an\r\nallusion to the vanished ring, and as a promise. This, however, is not\r\nKant's characteristic manner in supporting moral and religious truth.\r\n\r\nTo account for the origin of the solar system, the German philosopher\r\nassumes that at the beginning of all things the material of which the\r\nsun, planets, satellites, and comets consist, was uncompounded, in its\r\nprimary elements, and filled the whole space in which the bodies formed\r\nout of it now revolve. This state of nature seemed to be the very\r\nsimplest that could follow upon nothing. In a space filled in this way a\r\nstate of rest could not last for more than a moment. The elements of a\r\ndenser kind would, according to the law of gravitation, attract matter\r\nof less specific gravity. Repulsion, as well as attraction, plays a part\r\namong the particles of matter disseminated in space. Through it the\r\ndirect fall of particles may be diverted into a circular movement about\r\nthe center toward which they are gravitating.\r\n\r\nOf course, in our system the center of attraction is the nucleus of the\r\nsun. The mass of this body increases rapidly, as also its power of\r\nattraction. Of the particles gravitating to it the heavier become heaped\r\nup in the center. In falling from different heights toward this common\r\nfocus the particles cannot have such perfect equality of resistance that\r\nno lateral movements should be set up. A general circulatory motion is\r\nin fact established ultimately in one direction about the central mass,\r\nwhich receiving new particles from the encircling current rotates in\r\nharmony with it.\r\n\r\nMutual interference in the particles outside the mass of the sun\r\nprevents all accumulation except in one plane and that takes the form of\r\na thin disk continuous with the sun's equator. In this circulating\r\nvaporous disk about the sun differences of density give rise to zones\r\nnot unlike the rings of Saturn. These zones ultimately contract to form\r\nplanets, and as the planets are thrown off from the central solar mass\r\ntill an equilibrium is established between the centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal forces, so the satellites in turn are formed from the\r\nplanets. The comets are to be regarded as parts of the system, akin to\r\nthe planets, but more remote from the control of the centripetal force\r\nof the sun. It is thus that Kant conceived the nebular hypothesis,\r\naccounting (through the formation of the heavenly bodies from a cloudy\r\nvapor similar to that still observable through the telescope) for the\r\nrevolution of the planets in one direction about the sun; the rotation\r\nof sun and planets; the revolution and rotation of satellites; the\r\ncomparative densities of the heavenly bodies; the materials in the tails\r\nof comets; the rings of Saturn, and other celestial phenomena. Newton,\r\nfinding no matter between the planets to maintain the community of their\r\nmovements, asserted that the immediate hand of God had instituted the\r\narrangement without the intervention of the forces of Nature. His\r\ndisciple Kant now undertook to explain an additional number of\r\nphenomena on mechanical principles. Granted the existence of matter, he\r\nfelt capable of tracing the cosmic evolution, but at the same time he\r\nmaintained and strengthened his religious position, and did not assume\r\n(like Democritus and Epicurus) eternal motion without a Creator or the\r\ncoming together of atoms by accident or haphazard.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected, he says, that Nature is sufficient unto itself;\r\nbut universal laws of the action of matter serve the plan of the Supreme\r\nWisdom. There is convincing proof of the existence of God in the very\r\nfact that Nature, even in chaos, cannot proceed otherwise than regularly\r\nand according to law. Even in the essential properties of the elements\r\nthat constituted the chaos, there could be traced the mark of that\r\nperfection which they have derived from their origin, their essential\r\ncharacter being a consequence of the eternal idea of the Divine\r\nIntelligence. Matter, which appears to be merely passive and wanting in\r\nform and arrangement, has in its simplest state a tendency to fashion\r\nitself by a natural development into a more perfect constitution. Matter\r\nmust be considered as created by God in accordance with law and as ever\r\nobedient to law, not as an independent or hostile force needing\r\noccasional correction. To suppose the material world not under law would\r\nbe to believe in a blind fate rather than in Providence. It is Nature's\r\nharmony and order revealed to our understanding that give us a clue to\r\nits creation by an understanding of the highest order.\r\n\r\nIn a work written eight years later Kant sought to furnish people of\r\nordinary intelligence with a proof of the existence of God. It might\r\nseem irrelevant in such a production to give an exposition of physical\r\nphenomena, but, intent on his method of mounting to a knowledge of God\r\nby means of natural science, he here repeats in summarized form his\r\ntheory of the origin of the heavenly bodies. Moreover, the influence of\r\nhis astronomical studies persisted in his maturest philosophy, as can be\r\nseen in the well-known passage at the conclusion of his ethical work,\r\nthe _Critique of the Practical Reason_ (1788): \"There are two things\r\nthat fill my spirit with ever new and increasing awe and reverence--the\r\nmore frequently and the more intently I contemplate them--the\r\nstar-strewn sky above me and the moral law within.\" His religious and\r\nethical conceptions were closely associated with--indeed, dependent\r\nupon--an orderly and infinite physical universe.\r\n\r\nIn the mathematician, astronomer, physicist, and philosopher, J. H.\r\nLambert (1728-1777), Kant found a genius akin to his own, and through\r\nhim hoped for a reformation of philosophy on the basis of the study of\r\nscience. Lambert like his contemporary was a disciple of Newton, and in\r\n1761 he published a book in the form of letters expressing views in\r\nreference to the Milky Way, fixed stars, central sun, very similar to\r\nthose published by Kant in 1755. Lambert had heard of Wright's work, so\r\nsimilar to his own, a year after the latter was written.\r\n\r\nComets, now robbed of many of the terrors with which ancient\r\nsuperstition endowed them, might, he says, seem to threaten catastrophe,\r\nby colliding with the planets or by carrying off a satellite. But the\r\nsame hand which has cast the celestial spheres in space, has traced\r\ntheir course in the heavens, and does not allow them to wander at\r\nrandom to disturb and destroy each other. Lambert imagines that all\r\nthese bodies have exactly the volume, weight, position, direction, and\r\nspeed necessary for the avoidance of collisions. If we confess a Supreme\r\nRuler who brought order from chaos, and gave form to the universe; it\r\nfollows that this universe is a perfect work, the impress, picture,\r\nreflex of its Creator's perfection. Nothing is left to blind chance.\r\nMeans are fitted to ends. There is order throughout, and in this order\r\nthe dust beneath our feet, the stars above our heads, atoms and worlds,\r\nare alike comprehended.\r\n\r\nLaplace in his statement of the nebular hypothesis made no mention of\r\nKant. He sets forth, in the _Exposition of the Solar System_, the\r\nastronomical data that the theory is designed to explain: the movements\r\nof the planets in the same direction and almost in the same plane; the\r\nmovements of the satellites in the same direction as those of the\r\nplanets; the rotation of these different bodies and of the sun in the\r\nsame direction as their projection, and in planes little different; the\r\nsmall eccentricity of the orbits of planets and satellites; the great\r\neccentricity of the orbits of comets. How on the ground of these data\r\nare we to arrive at the cause of the earliest movements of the planetary\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\nA fluid of immense extent must be assumed, embracing all these bodies.\r\nIt must have circulated about the sun like an atmosphere and, in virtue\r\nof the excessive heat which was engendered, it may be assumed that this\r\natmosphere originally extended beyond the orbits of all the planets, and\r\nwas contracted by stages to its present form. In its primitive state\r\nthe sun resembled the nebulæ, which are to be observed through the\r\ntelescope, with fiery centers and cloudy periphery. One can imagine a\r\nmore and more diffuse state of the nebulous matter.\r\n\r\nPlanets were formed, in the plane of the equator and at the successive\r\nlimits of the nebulous atmosphere, by the condensation of the different\r\nzones which it abandoned as it cooled and contracted. The force of\r\ngravity and the centrifugal force sufficed to maintain in its orbit each\r\nsuccessive planet. From the cooling and contracting masses that were to\r\nconstitute the planets smaller zones and rings were formed. In the case\r\nof Saturn there was such regularity in the rings that the annular form\r\nwas maintained; as a rule from the zones abandoned by the planet-mass\r\nsatellites resulted. Differences of temperature and density of the parts\r\nof the original mass account for the eccentricity of orbits, and\r\ndeviations from the plane of the equator.\r\n\r\nIn his _Celestial Mechanics_ (1825) Laplace states that, according to\r\nHerschel's observations, Saturn's rotation is slightly quicker than that\r\nof its rings. This seemed a confirmation of the hypothesis of the\r\n_Exposition du Système du Monde_.\r\n\r\nWhen Laplace presented the first edition of this earlier work to\r\nNapoleon, the First Consul said: \"Newton has spoken of God in his book.\r\nI have already gone through yours, and I have not found that name in it\r\na single time.\" To this Laplace is said to have replied: \"First Citizen\r\nConsul, I have not had need of that hypothesis.\" The astronomer did not,\r\nhowever, profess atheism; like Kant he felt competent to explain on\r\nmechanical principles the development of the solar system from the point\r\nat which he undertook it. In his later years he desired that the\r\nmisleading anecdote should be suppressed. So far was he from\r\nself-sufficiency and dogmatism that his last utterance proclaimed the\r\nlimitations of even the greatest intellects: \"What we know is little\r\nenough, what we don't know is immense\" (_Ce que nous connaissons est peu\r\nde chose, ce que nous ignorons est immense_).\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel's observations, extended over many years, confirmed\r\nboth the nebular hypothesis and the theory of the systematic arrangement\r\nof the stars. He made use of telescopes 20 and 40 feet in focal length,\r\nand of 18.7 and 48 inches aperture, and was thereby enabled, as Humboldt\r\nsaid, to sink a plummet amid the fixed stars, or, in his own phrase, to\r\ngauge the heavens. _The Construction of the Heavens_ was always the\r\nultimate object of his observations. In a contribution on this subject\r\nsubmitted to the Royal Society in 1787 he announced the discovery of 466\r\nnew nebulæ and clusters of stars. The sidereal heavens are not to be\r\nregarded as the concave surface of a sphere, from the center of which\r\nthe observer might be supposed to look, but rather as resembling a rich\r\nextent of ground or chains of mountains in which the geologist discovers\r\nmany strata consisting of various materials. The Milky Way is one\r\nstratum and in it our sun is placed, though perhaps not in the very\r\ncenter of its thickness.\r\n\r\nBy 1811 he had greatly increased his observations of the nebulæ and\r\ncould arrange them in series differing in extent, condensation,\r\nbrightness, general form, possession of nuclei, situation, and in\r\nresemblance to comets and to stars. They ranged from a faint trace of\r\nextensive diffuse nebulosity to a nebulous star with a mere vestige of\r\ncloudiness. Herschel was able to make the series so complete that the\r\ndifference between the members was no more than could be found in a\r\nseries of pictures of the human figure taken from the birth of a child\r\ntill he comes to be a man in his prime. The difference between the\r\ndiffuse nebulous matter and the star is so striking that the idea of\r\nconversion from one to the other would hardly occur to any one without\r\nevidence of the intermediate steps. It is highly probable that each\r\nsuccessive state is the result of the action of gravity.\r\n\r\nIn his last statement, 1818, he admitted that to his telescopes the\r\nMilky Way had proved fathomless, but on \"either side of this assemblage\r\nof stars, presumably in ceaseless motion round their common center of\r\ngravity, Herschel discovered a canopy of discrete nebulous masses, such\r\nas those from the condensation of which he supposed the whole stellar\r\nuniverse to be formed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the theory of the evolution of the heavenly bodies, as set forth by\r\nKant, Laplace, and Herschel, it was assumed that the elements that\r\ncomposed the earth are also to be found elsewhere throughout the solar\r\nsystem and the universe. The validity of this assumption was finally\r\nestablished by spectrum analysis. But this vindication was in part\r\nanticipated, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, by the analysis\r\nof meteorites. In these were found large quantities of iron,\r\nconsiderable percentages of nickel, as well as cobalt, copper, silicon,\r\nphosphorus, carbon, magnesium, zinc, and manganese.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n G.

Boyle had, indeed, made a beginning,\r\nnot only by his study of the elasticity of the air, but by his\r\ndistinction of the elements and compounds and his definition of\r\nchemistry as the science of the composition of substances. How little\r\nhad been accomplished, however, is evident from the fact that in 1750\r\nthe so-called elements--earth, air, fire, water--which Bacon had marked\r\nfor examination in 1620, were still unanalyzed, and that no advance had\r\nbeen made beyond his conception of the nature of heat, the majority,\r\nindeed, of the learned world holding that heat is a substance (variously\r\nidentified with sulphur, carbon, or hydrogen) rather than a mode of\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nHow scientific thought succeeded in bringing order out of confusion and\r\nchaos in the subsequent one hundred years, and especially at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, can well be illustrated by these\r\nvery matters, the study of combustion, of heat as a form of energy, of\r\nthe constituents of the atmosphere, and of the chemistry of water and of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to Black's discovery of carbonic acid,\r\nand of the phenomena which he ascribed to latent heat. The first\r\ndiscovery (1754) was the result of the preparation of quicklime in the\r\npractice of medicine; the second (1761) involving experiments on the\r\ntemperatures of melting ice, boiling water, and steam, stimulated Watt\r\nin his improvement of the steam engine. In 1766 Joseph Priestley began\r\nhis study of airs, or gases. In the following year observation of work\r\nin a brewery roused his curiosity in reference to carbonic acid. In 1772\r\nhe experimented with nitric oxide. In the previous century Mayow had\r\nobtained nitric oxide by treating iron with nitric acid. He had then\r\nintroduced this gas into ordinary air confined over water, and found\r\nthat the mixture suffered a reduction of volume. Priestley applied this\r\nprocess to the analysis of common air, which he discovered to be complex\r\nand not simple. In 1774, by heating red oxide of mercury by means of a\r\nburning-glass, he obtained a gas which supported combustion better than\r\ncommon air. He inhaled it, and experienced a sense of exhilaration. \"Who\r\ncan tell,\" he writes, \"but in time this pure air may become a\r\nfashionable article in luxury? Hitherto only two mice and myself have\r\nhad the privilege of breathing it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Swedish investigator Scheele had, however, discovered this same\r\nconstituent of the air before 1773. He thought that the atmosphere must\r\nconsist of at least two gases, and he proved that carbonic acid results\r\nfrom combustion and respiration. In 1772 the great French scientist\r\nLavoisier found that sulphur, when burned, gains weight instead of\r\nlosing weight, and five years later he concluded that air consists of\r\ntwo gases, one capable of absorption by burning bodies, the other\r\nincapable of supporting combustion. He called the first \"oxygen.\" In his\r\n_Elements of Chemistry_ Lavoisier gave a clear exposition of his system\r\nof chemistry and of the discoveries of other European chemists. After\r\nhis studies the atmosphere was no longer regarded as mysterious and\r\nchaotic. It was known to consist largely of oxygen and nitrogen, and to\r\ncontain in addition aqueous vapor, carbonic acid, and ammonia which\r\nmight be brought to earth by rain.\r\n\r\nCavendish obtained nitrogen from air by using nitric oxide to remove the\r\noxygen, and found that air consists of about seventy-nine per cent\r\nnitrogen and about twenty-one per cent oxygen. He also by use of the\r\nelectric spark caused the oxygen and nitrogen of the air to unite to\r\nform nitric acid. When the nitrogen was exhausted and the redundant\r\noxygen removed, \"only a small bubble of air remained unabsorbed.\"\r\nSimilarly Cavendish had found that water results from the combination of\r\noxygen and hydrogen. Watt had likewise held that water is not an\r\nelement, but a compound of two elementary substances. Thus the great\r\nmasses,--earth, air, fire, water,--assumed as simple by many\r\nphilosophers from the earliest times, were resolving into their\r\nconstituent parts. At the same time other problems were demanding\r\nsolution. What are the laws of chemical combination? What is the\r\nrelation of heat to other forms of energy? To the answering of these\r\nquestions (as of those from which these grew) the great manufacturing\r\ncenters contributed, and no city more potently than Manchester through\r\nDalton and his pupil and follower Joule.\r\n\r\nJohn Dalton (1766-1844) was born in Cumberland, went to Kendal to teach\r\nschool at the age of fifteen, and remained in the Lake District of\r\nEngland till 1793. In this region, where the annual rainfall exceeds\r\nforty inches, and in some localities is almost tropical, the young\r\nstudent's attention was early drawn to meteorology. His apparatus\r\nconsisted of rude home-made rain-gauges, thermometers, and barometers.\r\nHis interest in the heat, moisture, and constituents of the atmosphere\r\ncontinued throughout life, and Dalton made in all some 200,000\r\nmeteorological observations. We gain a clue to his motive in these\r\nstudies from a letter written in his twenty-second year, in which he\r\nspeaks of the advantages that might accrue to the husbandman, the\r\nmariner, and to mankind in general if we were able to predict the state\r\nof the weather with tolerable precision.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 Dalton took up his permanent residence in Manchester, and in\r\nthat year appeared his first book, _Meteorological Observations and\r\nEssays_. Here he deals, among other things, with rainfall, the formation\r\nof clouds, evaporation, and the distribution and character of\r\natmospheric moisture. It seemed to him that aqueous vapor always exists\r\nas a distinct fluid maintaining its identity among the other fluids of\r\nthe atmosphere. He thought of atmospheric moisture as consisting of\r\nminute drops of water, or globules among the globules of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen. He was a disciple of Newton's (to whom, indeed, Dalton had\r\nsome personal likeness), who looked upon matter as consisting of \"solid,\r\nmassy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles, of such sizes and figures,\r\nand with such other properties, and in such proportion, as most\r\nconduced to the end for which God formed them.\" Dalton was so much under\r\nthe influence of the idea that the physical universe is made up of these\r\nindivisible particles, or atoms, that his biographer describes him as\r\nthinking _corpuscularly_. It is probable that his imagination was of the\r\nvisualizing type and that he could picture to himself the arrangement of\r\natoms in elementary and compound substances.\r\n\r\nNow Dalton's master had taught that the atoms of matter in a gas\r\n(elastic fluid) repel one another by a force increasing in proportion as\r\ntheir distance diminishes. How did this teaching apply to the\r\natmosphere, which Priestley and others had proved to consist of three or\r\nmore gases? Why does this mixture appear simple and homogeneous? Why\r\ndoes not the air form strata with the oxygen below and the nitrogen\r\nabove? Cavendish had shown, and Dalton himself later proved, that common\r\nair, wherever examined, contains oxygen and nitrogen in fairly constant\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nFrench chemists had sought to apply the principle of _chemical affinity_\r\nin explaining the apparent homogeneity of the atmosphere. They supposed\r\nthat oxygen and nitrogen entered into chemical union, the one element\r\ndissolving the other. The resultant compound in turn dissolved water;\r\nhence the phenomena of evaporation. Dalton tried in vain to reconcile\r\nthis supposition with his belief in the atomic nature of matter. He drew\r\ndiagrams combining an atom of oxygen with an atom of nitrogen and an\r\natom of aqueous vapor. The whole atmosphere could not consist of such\r\ngroups of three because the watery particles were but a small portion of\r\nthe total atmosphere. He made a diagram in which one atom of oxygen was\r\ncombined with one atom of nitrogen, but in this case the oxygen was\r\ninsufficient to satisfy all the nitrogen of the atmosphere. If the air\r\nwas made up partly of pure nitrogen, partly of a compound of nitrogen\r\nand oxygen, and partly of a compound of nitrogen, oxygen, and aqueous\r\nvapor, then the triple compound, as heaviest, would collect toward the\r\nsurface of the earth, and the double compound and the simple substance\r\nwould form two strata above. If to the compounds heat were added in the\r\nhope of producing an unstratified mixture, the atmosphere would acquire\r\nthe specific gravity of nitrogen gas. \"In short,\" says Dalton, \"I was\r\nobliged to abandon the hypothesis of the chemical constitution of the\r\natmosphere altogether as irreconcilable to the phenomena.\"\r\n\r\nHe had to return to the conception of the individual particles of\r\noxygen, nitrogen, and water, each a center of repulsion. Still he could\r\nnot explain why the oxygen did not gravitate to the lowest place, the\r\nnitrogen form a stratum above, and the aqueous vapor swim upon the top.\r\nIn 1801, however, Dalton hit upon the idea that gases act as _vacua_ for\r\none another, that it is only like particles which repel each other,\r\natoms of oxygen repelling atoms of oxygen and atoms of nitrogen\r\nrepelling atoms of nitrogen when these gases are intermingled in the\r\natmosphere just as they would if existing in an unmixed state.\r\n\"According to this, we were to suppose that atoms of one kind did _not_\r\nrepel the atoms of another kind, but only those of their own kind.\" A\r\nmixed atmosphere is as free from stratifications, as though it were\r\nreally homogeneous.\r\n\r\nIn his analyses of air Dalton made use of the old nitric oxide method.\r\nIn 1802 this led to an interesting discovery. If in a tube .3 of an inch\r\nwide he mixed 100 parts of common air with 36 parts of nitric oxide, the\r\noxygen of the air combined with the nitric oxide, and a residue of 79\r\nparts of atmospheric nitrogen remained. And if he mixed 100 parts of\r\ncommon air with 72 of nitric oxide, but in a wide vessel over water (in\r\nwhich conditions the combination is more quickly effected), the oxygen\r\nof the air again combined with the nitric oxide and a residue of 79\r\nparts of nitrogen again resulted. But in the last experiment, if less\r\nthan 72 parts of nitric oxide be employed, there will be a residue of\r\noxygen as well as nitrogen; and if more than 72, there will be a residue\r\nof nitric oxide in addition to the nitrogen. In the words of Dalton,\r\n\"oxygen may combine with a certain portion of nitrous gas [as he called\r\nnitric oxide], or with twice that portion, but with no intermediate\r\nportion.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally these experimental facts were to be explained in terms of the\r\nultimate particles of which the various gases are composed. In the\r\nfollowing year Dalton gave graphic representation to his idea of the\r\natomic constitution of chemical elements and compounds.\r\n\r\n         ( )  Hydrogen\r\n         (|)  Nitrogen\r\n         (·)  Oxygen\r\n         (*)  Carbon\r\n     (|) (·)  Nitric oxide\r\n (·) (|) (·)  Nitrous oxide\r\n (·) (*) (·)  Carbonic acid\r\n\r\nMuch against Dalton's will his method of indicating chemical elements\r\nand their combinations had to yield to a method introduced by the great\r\nSwedish chemist Berzelius. In 1837 Dalton wrote: \"Berzelius's symbols\r\nare horrifying: a young student in chemistry might as soon learn Hebrew\r\nas make himself acquainted with them. They appear like a chaos of atoms\r\n... and to equally perplex the adepts of science, to discourage the\r\nlearner, as well as to cloud the beauty and simplicity of the Atomic\r\nTheory.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime Dalton's mind had been turning to the consideration of the\r\nrelative sizes and weights of the various elements entering into\r\ncombination with one another. He argued that if there be not exactly the\r\nsame _number_ of atoms of oxygen in a given volume of air as of nitrogen\r\nin the same volume, then the sizes of the particles of oxygen must be\r\ndifferent from those of nitrogen. His interest in the absorption of\r\ngases by water, in the reciprocal diffusion of gases, as well as in the\r\nphenomena of chemical combination, stimulated Dalton to determine the\r\n_relative_ size and weight of the atoms of the various elements. Dalton\r\nsaid nothing of the _absolute_ weight of the atom. But on the assumption\r\nthat when only one compound of two elements is known to exist, the\r\nmolecule of the compound consists of one atom of each of these elements,\r\nhe proceeded to investigate the relative weights of equal numbers of the\r\ntwo sorts of atoms. In 1803 he pursued this investigation with\r\nremarkable success, and taking hydrogen (the lightest gas known to him)\r\nas unity, he arrived at a statement of the relative atomic weights of\r\noxygen, nitrogen, carbon, etc. Dalton thus introduced into the study of\r\nchemical combination a very definite idea of quantitative relationship.\r\nBy him the atomic theory of the constitution of matter was made\r\ndefinite and applicable to all the phenomena known to chemistry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Painting by Ford Madox Brown_ _By permission of the Town\r\nHall Committee of the Manchester Corporation_\r\n\r\nJOHN DALTON COLLECTING MARSH GAS]\r\n\r\nDuring the following months he returned to the study of those cases in\r\nwhich the same elements combine to form more than one compound. We have\r\nseen that oxygen unites with nitric oxide to form two compounds, and\r\nthat into the one compound twice as much nitric oxide (by weight) enters\r\nas into the other. A like relation was found in the weight of oxygen\r\ncombining with carbon in the two compounds carbon monoxide and carbonic\r\nacid. In the summer of 1804 he investigated the composition of two\r\ncompounds of hydrogen and carbon, marsh gas (methane) and olefiant gas\r\n(ethylene), and found that the first contained just twice as much\r\nhydrogen in relation to the carbon as the second compound contained. In\r\na series of compounds of the same two elements one atom of one unites\r\nwith one, two, three, or more atoms of the other; that is, a simple\r\nratio exists between the weights in which the second element enters into\r\ncombination with the first. This law of multiple proportions afforded\r\nconfirmation of Dalton's atomic theory, or chemical theory of definite\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n\"Without such a theory,\" says Sir Henry Roscoe, \"modern chemistry would\r\nbe a chaos; with it, order reigns supreme, and every apparently\r\ncontradictory discovery only marks out more distinctly the value and\r\nimportance of Dalton's work.\" In 1826 Sir Humphry Davy recognized\r\nDalton's services to science in the following terms: \"Finding that in\r\ncertain compounds of gaseous bodies the same elements always combined\r\nin the same proportions, and that when there was more than one\r\ncombination the quantity of the elements always had a constant\r\nrelation,--such as 1 to 2, or 1 to 3, or 1 to 4,--he explained this fact\r\non the Newtonian doctrine of indivisible atoms; and contended that, the\r\nrelative weight of one atom to that of any other atom being known, its\r\nproportions or weight in all its combinations might be ascertained, thus\r\nmaking the statics of chemistry depend upon simple questions in\r\nsubtraction or multiplication and enabling the student to deduce an\r\nimmense number of facts from a few well-authenticated experimental\r\nresults. Mr. Dalton's permanent reputation will rest upon his having\r\ndiscovered a simple principle universally applicable to the facts of\r\nchemistry, in fixing the proportions in which bodies combine, and thus\r\nlaying the foundation for future labors respecting the sublime and\r\ntranscendental parts of the science of corpuscular motion. His merits in\r\nthis respect resemble those of Kepler in astronomy.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Dalton's atomic theory received striking confirmation through\r\nthe investigations of the French scientist Gay-Lussac, who showed that\r\ngases, under similar circumstances of temperature and pressure, always\r\ncombine in simple proportions by _volume_ when they act on one another,\r\nand that when the result of the union is a gas, its volume also is in a\r\nsimple ratio to the volumes of its components. One of Dalton's friends\r\nsummed up the result of Gay-Lussac's research in this simple fashion:\r\n\"His paper is on the combination of gases. He finds that all unite in\r\nequal bulks, or two bulks of one to one of another, or three bulks of\r\none to one of another.\" When Dalton had investigated the relative\r\nweights with which elements combine, he had found no simple arithmetical\r\nrelationship between atomic weight and atomic weight. When two or more\r\ncompounds of the same elements are formed, Dalton found, however, as we\r\nhave seen, that the proportion of the element added to form the second\r\nor third compound is a multiple by weight of the first quantity.\r\nGay-Lussac now showed that gases, \"in whatever proportions they may\r\ncombine, always give rise to compounds whose elements by volume are\r\nmultiples of each other.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Avogadro, in an essay on the relative masses of atoms, succeeded\r\nin further confirming Dalton's theory and in explaining the atomic basis\r\nof Gay-Lussac's discovery of simple volume relations in the formation of\r\nchemical compounds. According to the Italian scientist the _number_ of\r\nmolecules in all gases is always the same for equal volumes, or always\r\nproportional to the volumes, it being taken for granted that the\r\ntemperature and pressure are the same for each gas. Dalton had supposed\r\nthat water is formed by the union of hydrogen and oxygen, atom for atom.\r\nGay-Lussac found that two volumes of hydrogen combined with one volume\r\nof oxygen to produce two volumes of water vapor. According to Avogadro\r\nthe water vapor contains twice as many atoms of hydrogen as of oxygen.\r\nOne volume of hydrogen has the same number of molecules as one volume of\r\noxygen. When the two volumes combine with one, the combination does\r\nnot take place, as Dalton had supposed, atom for atom, but each\r\nhalf-molecule of oxygen combines with one molecule of hydrogen. The\r\nsymbol for water is, therefore, not HO but H{2}O.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to establish Dalton's claim to be styled a great\r\nlawgiver of chemical science. His influence in further advancing\r\ndefinitely formulated knowledge of physical phenomena can here be\r\nindicated only in part. In 1800 he wrote a paper _On the Heat and Cold\r\nproduced by the Mechanical Condensation and Rarefaction of Air_. This\r\ncontains, according to Dalton's biographer, the first quantitative\r\nstatement of the heat evolved by compression and the heat evolved by\r\ndilatation. His contribution to the theory of heat has been stated thus:\r\nThe volume of a gas under constant pressure expands when raised to the\r\nboiling temperature by the same fraction of itself, whatever be the\r\nnature of the gas. In 1798 Count Rumford had reported to the Royal\r\nSociety his _Enquiry concerning the Source of Heat excited by Friction_,\r\nthe data for which had been gathered at Munich. Interested as he was in\r\nthe practical problem of providing heat for the homes of the city poor,\r\nRumford had been struck by the amount of heat developed in the\r\nboring-out of cannon at the arsenal. He concluded that anything which\r\ncould be created indefinitely by a process of friction could not be a\r\nsubstance, such as sulphur or hydrogen, but must be a mode of motion. In\r\nthe same year the youthful Davy was following independently this line of\r\ninvestigation by rubbing two pieces of ice together, by clock-work, in a\r\nvacuum. The friction caused the ice to melt, although the experiment was\r\nundertaken in a temperature of 29° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nFor James Prescott Joule (1818-1889), who came of a family of brewers\r\nand was early engaged himself in the brewing industry, was reserved,\r\nhowever, the distinction of discovering the exact relation between heat\r\nand mechanical energy. After having studied chemistry under Dalton at\r\nManchester, he became engrossed in physical experimentation. In 1843 he\r\nprepared a paper _On the Calorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity\r\nand on the Mechanical Value of Heat_. In this he dealt with the\r\nrelations between heat and the ordinary forms of mechanical power,\r\nand demonstrated that the mechanical energy spent \"in turning a\r\nmagneto-electrical machine is _converted into the heat_ evolved by the\r\npassage of the currents of induction through its coils; and, on the\r\nother hand, that the motive power of the electro-magnetic engine is\r\nobtained at the expense of the heat due to the chemical reactions of the\r\nbattery by which it is worked.\" In 1844 he proceeded to apply the\r\nprinciples maintained in his earlier study to changes of temperature as\r\nrelated to changes in the density of gases. He was conscious of the\r\npractical, as well as the theoretical, import of his investigation.\r\nIndeed, it was through the determination by this illustrious pupil of\r\nDalton's of the amount of heat produced by the compression of gases that\r\none of the greatest improvements of the steam engine was later effected.\r\nJoule felt that his investigation at the same time confirmed the\r\ndynamical theory of heat which originated with Bacon, and had at a\r\nsubsequent period been so well supported by the experiments of Rumford,\r\nDavy, and others.\r\n\r\nAlready, in this paper of June, 1844, Joule had expressed the hope of\r\nascertaining the mechanical equivalent of heat with the accuracy that\r\nits importance for physical science demanded. He returned to this\r\nquestion again and again. According to his final result the quantity of\r\nheat required to raise one pound of water in temperature by one degree\r\nFahrenheit is equivalent to the mechanical energy required to raise\r\n772.55 pounds through a distance of one foot. Heat was thus demonstrated\r\nto be a form of energy, the relation being constant between it and\r\nmechanical energy. Mechanical energy may be converted into heat; if heat\r\ndisappears, some other form of energy, equivalent in amount to the heat\r\nlost, must replace it. The doctrine that a certain quantity of heat is\r\nalways equivalent to a certain amount of mechanical energy is only a\r\nspecial case of the Law of the Conservation of Energy, first clearly\r\nenunciated by Joule and Helmholtz in 1847, and generally regarded as the\r\nmost important scientific discovery of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nRoscoe, referring to the two life-sized marble statues which face each\r\nother in the Manchester Town Hall, says with pardonable pride: \"Thus\r\nhonor is done to Manchester's two greatest sons--to Dalton, the founder\r\nof modern Chemistry and of the Atomic Theory, and the discoverer of the\r\nlaws of chemical combining proportions; to Joule, the founder of modern\r\nPhysics and the discoverer of the Law of the Conservation of Energy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Alembic Club Reprints, _Foundations of the Atomic Theory_.\r\n\r\n Joseph Priestley, _Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of\r\n   Air_.\r\n\r\n Sir William Ramsay, _The Gases of the Atmosphere and the History of\r\n   their Discovery_.\r\n\r\n Sir Henry E.

On either side of the peninsula the Atlantic in varying mood\r\nlies extended in summer sunshine, or from its shroud of mist thunders on\r\nthe black cliffs and their time-sculptured sandstones. From the\r\ncoast inland, stretch, between flowered lanes and hedges, rolling\r\npasture-lands of rich green made all the more vivid by the deep reddish\r\ntint of the ploughed fields. In Penzance, then a town of about three\r\nthousand inhabitants, and in its picturesque vicinity, the early years\r\nof Davy's life were passed. Across the bay rose the great vision of the\r\nguarded mount (St. Michael's) of which Milton's verse speaks. Farther to\r\nthe east lay Lizard Head, the southernmost promontory of England, and a\r\nfew miles to the north St. Ives with its sweep of sandy beach; while not\r\nfar to the west of Penzance Land's End stood sentry \"'Twixt two\r\nunbounded seas.\" The youthful Davy was keenly alive to the charms of his\r\nearly environment, and his genius was susceptible to the belief in\r\nsupernatural agencies native to the imaginative Celtic people among whom\r\nhe was reared. As a precocious child of five he improvised rhymes, and\r\nas a youth set forth in excellent verse the glories of Mount's Bay:--\r\n\r\n \"There did I first rejoice that I was born\r\n Amidst the majesty of azure seas.\"\r\n\r\nDavy received what is usually called a liberal education, putting in\r\nnine years in the Penzance and one year in the Truro Grammar School. His\r\nbest exercises were translations from the classics into English verse.\r\nHe was rather idle, fond of fishing (an enthusiasm he retained\r\nthroughout life) and shooting, and less appreciated and beloved by his\r\nmasters than by his school-fellows, who recognized his wonderful\r\nabilities, sought his aid in their Latin compositions (as well as in the\r\nwriting of letters and valentines), and listened eagerly to his\r\nimaginative tales of wonder and horror. Years later he wrote to his\r\nmother: \"After all, the way in which we are taught Latin and Greek does\r\nnot much influence the important structure of our minds. I consider it\r\nfortunate that I was left much to myself when a child, and put upon no\r\nparticular plan of study, and that I enjoyed much idleness at Mr.\r\nCoryton's school. I perhaps owe to these circumstances the little\r\ntalents that I have and their peculiar application.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Davy was about sixteen years old, his father died, leaving the\r\nwidow and her five children, of whom Humphry was the eldest, with very\r\nscanty provision. The mind of the youth seemed to undergo an immediate\r\nchange. He expressed his resolution (which he nobly carried out) to play\r\nhis part as son and brother. Within a few weeks he became apprenticed to\r\nan apothecary and surgeon, and, having thus found his vocation, drew up\r\nhis own particular plan of self-education, to which he rigidly adhered.\r\nHis brother, Dr. John Davy, bears witness that the following is\r\ntranscribed from a notebook of Humphry's, bearing the date of the same\r\nyear as his apprenticeship (1795):--\r\n\r\n 1. Theology or Religion    }  Taught by Nature.\r\n    Ethics or Moral Virtues }         by Revelation.\r\n\r\n 2. Geography.\r\n\r\n 3. My Profession--\r\n    1. Botany. 2. Pharmacy. 3. Nosology. 4. Anatomy.\r\n    5. Surgery. 6. Chemistry.\r\n\r\n 4. Logic.\r\n\r\n 5. Language, etc.\r\n\r\nA series of essays which Davy wrote in pursuing his scheme of\r\nself-culture proves how rapidly his mind drew away from the\r\nsuperstitions which characterized the masses of the people among whom he\r\nlived. He had as a boy been haunted by the fear of monsters and witches\r\nin which the credulous of all classes then believed. His notebook shows\r\nthat he was now subjecting to examination the religious and political\r\nopinions of his time. He composed essays on the immortality and\r\nimmateriality of the soul, on governments, on the credulity of mortals,\r\non the dependence of the thinking powers on the organization of the\r\nbody, on the ultimate end of being, on happiness, and on moral\r\nobligation. He studied the writings of Locke, Hartley, Berkeley, Hume,\r\nHelvetius, Condorcet, and Reid, and knew something of German philosophy.\r\nIt was not till he was nineteen that Davy entered on the experimental\r\nstudy of chemistry.\r\n\r\nGuided by the _Elements_ of Lavoisier, encouraged by the friendship of\r\nGregory Watt (a son of James Watt) and by another gentleman of\r\nuniversity education, stimulated by contact with the Cornish mining\r\nindustry, Davy pursued this new study with zeal, and within a few months\r\nhad written two essays full of daring generalizations on the physical\r\nsciences. These were published early in 1799. Partly on the basis of the\r\ningenious experiment mentioned in the preceding chapter, he came to the\r\nconclusion that \"Heat, or that power which prevents the actual contact\r\nof the corpuscles of bodies, and which is the cause of our peculiar\r\nsensations of heat and cold, may be defined as a peculiar motion,\r\nprobably a vibration, of the corpuscles of bodies, tending to separate\r\nthem.\" Other passages might be quoted from these essays to show how the\r\ngifted youth of nineteen anticipated the science of subsequent decades,\r\nbut in the main these early efforts were characterized by the faults of\r\noverwrought speculation and incomplete verification. He soon regretted\r\nthe premature publication of his studies. \"When I consider,\" he wrote,\r\n\"the variety of theories that may be formed on the slender foundation of\r\none or two facts, I am convinced that it is the business of the true\r\nphilosopher to avoid them altogether. It is more laborious to accumulate\r\nfacts than to reason concerning them; but one good experiment is of more\r\nvalue than the ingenuity of a brain like Newton's.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Davy had been chosen superintendent of the Pneumatic\r\nInstitution at Bristol by Dr. Beddoes, its founder. It was supported by\r\nthe contributions of Thomas Wedgwood and other distinguished persons,\r\nand aimed at discovering by means of experiment the physiological effect\r\nof inhaling different gases, or \"factitious airs,\" as they were called.\r\nThe founding of such an establishment has been termed a scientific\r\naberration, but the use now made in medical practice of oxygen, nitrous\r\noxide, chloroform, and other inhalations bears witness to the sanity of\r\nthe sort of research there set on foot. Even before going to Bristol,\r\nDavy had inhaled small quantities of nitrous oxide mixed with air, in\r\nspite of the fact that this gas had been held by a medical man to be the\r\n\"principle of contagion.\" He now carried on a series of tests, and\r\nfinally undertook an extended experiment with the assistance of a\r\ndoctor. In an air-tight or box-chamber he inhaled great quantities of\r\nthe supposedly dangerous gas. After he had been in the box an hour and a\r\nquarter, he respired twenty quarts of pure nitrous oxide. He described\r\nthe experience in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"A thrilling, extending from the chest to the extremities, was almost\r\nimmediately produced. I felt a sense of tangible extension highly\r\npleasurable in every limb; my visible impressions were dazzling, and\r\napparently magnified; I heard every sound in the room, and was perfectly\r\naware of my situation. By degrees, as the pleasurable sensations\r\nincreased, I lost all connection with external things; trains of vivid\r\nvisible images rapidly passed through my mind, and were connected with\r\nwords in such a manner, as to produce perceptions perfectly novel. I\r\nexisted in a world of newly connected and newly modified ideas: I\r\ntheorized, I imagined that I made discoveries. When I was awakened from\r\nthis semi-delirious trance by Dr. Kinglake, who took the bag from my\r\nmouth, indignation and pride were the first feelings produced by the\r\nsight of the persons about me. My emotions were enthusiastic and\r\nsublime, and for a minute I walked round the room perfectly regardless\r\nof what was said to me. As I recovered my former state of mind, I felt\r\nan inclination to communicate the discoveries I had made during the\r\nexperiment. I endeavored to recall the ideas: they were feeble and\r\nindistinct; one collection of terms, however, presented itself; and with\r\nthe most intense belief and prophetic manner, I exclaimed to Dr.\r\nKinglake, '_Nothing exists but thoughts! The universe is composed of\r\nimpressions, ideas, pleasures and pains!_'\"\r\n\r\nDavy aroused the admiration and interest of every one who met him. A\r\nliterary man to whom he was introduced shortly after his arrival in\r\nBristol spoke of the intellectual character of the young man's face. His\r\neye was piercing, and when he was not engaged in conversation, its\r\nexpression indicated abstraction, as though his mind were pursuing some\r\nsevere train of thought scarcely to be interrupted by external objects;\r\n\"and,\" this writer adds, \"his ingenuousness impressed me as much as his\r\nmental superiority.\" Mrs. Beddoes, a gay, witty, and elegant lady, and\r\nan ardent admirer of the youthful scientist, was a sister of Maria\r\nEdgeworth. The novelist's tolerance of Davy's enthusiasm soon passed\r\ninto a clear recognition of his commanding genius. Coleridge, Southey,\r\nand other congenial friends, whom the chemist met under Dr. Beddoes'\r\nroof, shared in the general admiration of his mental and social\r\nqualities. Southey spoke of him as a miraculous young man, at whose\r\ntalents he could only wonder. Coleridge, when asked how Davy compared\r\nwith the cleverest men he had met on a visit to London, replied\r\nexpressively: \"Why, Davy can eat them all! There is an energy, an\r\nelasticity in his mind, which enables him to seize on and analyze all\r\nquestions, pushing them to their legitimate consequences. Every subject\r\nin Davy's mind has the principle of vitality. Living thoughts spring up\r\nlike turf under his feet.\" He thought that if Davy had not been the\r\nfirst chemist he would have been the first poet of the age. Their\r\ncorrespondence attests the intimate interchange of ideas and sentiments\r\nbetween these two men of genius, so different, yet with so much in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 Davy was appointed assistant lecturer in chemistry at the Royal\r\nInstitution (Albemarle Street, London), which had been founded from\r\nphilanthropic motives by Count Rumford in 1799. Its aim was to promote\r\nthe application of science to the common purposes of life. Its founder\r\ndesired while benefiting the poor to enlist the sympathies of the\r\nfashionable world. Davy, with a zeal for the cause of humanity and a\r\nclear recognition of the value of a knowledge of chemistry in technical\r\nindustries and other daily occupations, lent himself readily to the\r\nfounder's plans. His success as a public expositor of science soon won\r\nhim promotion to the professorship of chemistry in the new institution,\r\nand through his influence an interest in scientific investigation became\r\nthe vogue of London society. His popularity as a lecturer was so great\r\nthat his best friends feared that the head of the brilliant provincial\r\nyouth of twenty-two might be turned by the adulation of which he soon\r\nbecame the object. \"I have read,\" writes his brother, \"copies of verses\r\naddressed to him then, ... anonymous effusions, some of them displaying\r\nmuch poetical taste as well as fervor of writing, and all showing the\r\ninfluence which his appearance and manner had on the more susceptible of\r\nhis audience.\"\r\n\r\nHis study of the tanning industry (1801-1802) and his lectures on\r\nagricultural chemistry (1803-1813) are indicative of the early purpose\r\nof the Royal Institution and of Davy's lifelong inclination. The focus\r\nof his scientific interest, however, rested on the furtherance of the\r\napplication of the electrical studies of Galvani and Volta in chemical\r\nanalysis. In a letter to the chairman of managers of the Royal\r\nInstitution Volta had in 1800 described his voltaic pile made up of a\r\nsuccession of zinc and copper plates in pairs separated by a moist\r\nconductor, and before the end of the same year Nicholson and Carlisle\r\nhad employed an electric current, produced by this newly devised\r\napparatus, in the decomposition of water into its elements.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the following year the _Philosophical Magazine_ states:\r\n\"We have also to notice a course of lectures, just commenced at the\r\ninstitution, on a new branch of philosophy--we mean Galvanic Phenomena.\r\nOn this interesting branch Mr. Davy (late of Bristol) gave the first\r\nlecture on the 25th of April. He began with the history of Galvanism,\r\ndetailed the successive discoveries, and described the different methods\r\nof accumulating influence.... He showed the effects of galvanism on the\r\nlegs of frogs, and exhibited some interesting experiments on the\r\ngalvanic effects on the solutions of metals in acids.\" In a paper\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society in 1806, _On Some Chemical Agencies of\r\nElectricity_, Davy put on record the result of years of experiment. For\r\nexample, as stated by his biographer, he had connected a cup of gypsum\r\nwith one of agate by means of asbestos, and filling each with purified\r\nwater, had inserted the negative wire of the battery in the agate cup,\r\nand the positive wire in that of the sulphate of lime. In about four\r\nhours he had found a strong solution of lime in the agate cup, and\r\nsulphuric acid in the cup of gypsum. On his reversing the arrangement,\r\nand carrying on the process for a similar length of time, the sulphuric\r\nacid appeared in the agate cup, and the solution of lime on the opposite\r\nside. It was thus that he studied the transfer of certain of the\r\nconstituent parts of bodies by the action of electricity. \"It is very\r\nnatural to suppose,\" says Davy, \"that the repellent and attractive\r\nenergies are communicated from one particle to another particle of the\r\nsame kind, so as to establish a conducting _chain_ in the fluid. There\r\nmay be a succession of decompositions and recompositions before the\r\nelectrolysis is complete.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of this paper in 1806 attracted much attention abroad,\r\nand gained for him--in spite of the fact that England and France were\r\nthen at war--a medal awarded, under an arrangement instituted by\r\nNapoleon a few years previously, for the best experimental work on the\r\nsubject of electricity. \"Some people,\" said Davy, \"say I ought not to\r\naccept this prize; and there have been foolish paragraphs in the papers\r\nto that effect; but if the two countries or governments are at war, the\r\nmen of science are not. That would, indeed, be a civil war of the worst\r\ndescription: we should rather, through the instrumentality of men of\r\nscience, soften the asperities of national hostility.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following year Davy reported other chemical changes produced by\r\nelectricity; he had succeeded in decomposing the fixed alkalis and\r\ndiscovering the elements potassium and sodium. To analyze a small piece\r\nof pure potash slightly moist from the atmosphere, he had placed it on\r\nan insulated platinum disk connected with the negative side of a voltaic\r\nbattery. A platinum wire connected with the positive side was brought in\r\ncontact with the upper surface of the alkali. \"The potash began to fuse\r\nat both its points of electrization.\" At the lower (negative) surface\r\nsmall globules having a high metallic luster like quicksilver appeared,\r\nsome of which burned with explosion and flame while others remained and\r\nbecame tarnished. When Davy saw these globules of a hitherto unknown\r\nmetal, he danced about the laboratory in ecstasy and for some time was\r\ntoo much excited to continue his experiments.\r\n\r\nAfter recovering from a very severe illness, owing in the judgment of\r\nsome to overapplication to experimental science, and in his own judgment\r\nto a visit to Newgate Prison with the purpose of improving its sanitary\r\ncondition, Davy made an investigation of the alkaline earths. He failed\r\nin his endeavor to obtain from these sources pure metals, but he gave\r\nnames to barium, strontium, calcium, and magnesium, conjecturing that\r\nthe alkaline earths were, like potash and soda, metallic oxides. In\r\naddition Davy anticipated the isolation of silicon, aluminium, and\r\nzirconium. No doubt what gave special zest to his study of the alkalis\r\nwas the hope of overthrowing the doctrine of French chemists that oxygen\r\nwas the essential element of every acid. Lavoisier had given it, indeed,\r\nthe name oxygen (acid-producer) on that supposition. Davy showed,\r\nhowever, that this element is a constituent of many alkalis.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 he advanced his controversy by explaining the nature of\r\nchlorine. Discovered long before by the indefatigable Scheele, it bore\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century the name oxymuriatic acid.\r\nDavy proved that it contained neither oxygen nor muriatic (hydrochloric)\r\nacid (though, as we know, it forms, with hydrogen, muriatic acid). He\r\ngave the name _chlorine_ because of the color of the gas (χλωρός, pale\r\ngreen). Davy studied later the compounds of fluorine, and though unable\r\nto isolate the element, conjectured its likeness to chlorine.\r\n\r\nHe lectured before the Dublin Society in 1810, and again in the\r\nfollowing year; on the occasion of his second visit receiving the degree\r\nof LL.D. from Trinity College. He was knighted in the spring of 1812,\r\nand was married to a handsome, intellectual, and wealthy lady. He was\r\nappointed Honorary Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution. His\r\nnew independence gave him full liberty to pursue his scientific\r\ninterests. Toward the close of 1812 he writes to Lady Davy:--\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I began some new experiments to which a very interesting\r\ndiscovery and a slight accident put an end. I made use of a compound\r\nmore powerful than gunpowder destined perhaps at some time to change the\r\nnature of war and influence the state of society. An explosion took\r\nplace which has done me no other harm than that of preventing me from\r\nworking this day and the effects of which will be gone to-morrow and\r\nwhich I should not mention at all, except that you may hear some foolish\r\nexaggerated account of it, for it really is not worth mentioning....\"\r\nThe compound on the investigation of which he was then engaged is now\r\nknown as the trichloride of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1813 Sir Humphry and Lady Davy, accompanied by Michael\r\nFaraday, who on Davy's recommendation had in the spring of the same year\r\nreceived a post at the Royal Institution, set out, in spite of the\r\ncontinuance of the war, on a Continental tour. At Paris Sir Humphry was\r\nwelcomed by the French scientists with every mark of distinction. A\r\nsubstance which had been found in the ashes of seaweed two years\r\npreviously, by a soap-boiler and manufacturer of saltpeter, was\r\nsubmitted to Davy for chemical examination. Until Davy's arrival in\r\nParis little had been done to determine its real character. On December\r\n6 Gay-Lussac presented a brief report on the new substance, which he\r\nnamed _iode_ and considered analogous to chlorine. Davy, working with\r\nalmost incredible rapidity in the presence of his rivals, was able a\r\nweek later to sketch the chief characters of this new element, now known\r\nby the name he chose for it--_iodine_.\r\n\r\nWe have passed over his investigation of boracic acid, ammonium nitrate,\r\nand other compounds; we can merely mention in passing his later studies\r\nof the diamond and other forms of carbon, of the chemical constituents\r\nof the pigments used by the ancients, his investigation of the torpedo\r\nfish, and his anticipation of the arc light.\r\n\r\nIt seems fitting that Sir Humphry Davy should be popularly remembered\r\nfor his invention of the miner's safety-lamp. At the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century the development of the iron industry, the increasing\r\nuse of the steam engine and of machinery in general led to great\r\nactivity and enterprise in the working of the coal mines. Colliery\r\nexplosions of fire-damp (marsh gas) became alarmingly frequent,\r\nespecially in the north of England. The mine-owners in some cases sought\r\nto suppress the news of fatalities. A society, however, was formed to\r\nprotect the miners from injury through gas explosions, and Davy was\r\nasked for advice. On his return from the Continent in 1815 he applied\r\nhimself energetically to the matter. He visited the mines and analyzed\r\nthe gas. He found that fire-damp explodes only at high temperature, and\r\nthat the flame of this explosive mixture will not pass through small\r\napertures. A miner's lamp was therefore constructed with wire gauze\r\nabout the flame to admit air for combustion. The fire-damp entering the\r\ngauze burned quietly inside, but could not carry a high enough\r\ntemperature through the gauze to explode the large quantity outside. To\r\none of the members of the philanthropic society which had appealed to\r\nhim Davy wrote: \"I have never received so much pleasure from the result\r\nof any of my chemical labours; for I trust the cause of humanity will\r\ngain something by it.\"\r\n\r\nDavy was elected President of the Royal Society in 1820, and retained\r\nthat dignity till he felt compelled by ill health to relinquish it in\r\n1827. \"It was his wish,\" says his brother, \"to have seen the Royal\r\nSociety an efficient establishment for all the great practical purposes\r\nof science, similar to the college contemplated by Lord Bacon, and\r\nsketched in his _New Atlantis_; having subordinate to it the Royal\r\nObservatory at Greenwich for astronomy; the British Museum, for natural\r\nhistory, in its most extensive acceptation.\"\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy, after a life crowded with splendid achievements, died\r\nat Geneva in 1829 with many of his noblest dreams unfulfilled.\r\nFortunately in Michael Faraday, who is sometimes referred to as the\r\ngreatest of his discoveries, he had a successor who was fully adequate\r\nto the task of furthering the various investigations that his genius had\r\nset on foot, and who, to the majority of men of mature mind, is no less\r\npersonally interesting than the Cornish scientist, poet, and\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n John Davy, _Works of Sir Humphry Davy_.\r\n\r\n John Davy, _Fragmentary Remains, literary and scientific, of Sir\r\n   Humphry Davy, Bart._\r\n\r\n Bence Jones, _Life and Letters of Faraday_.\r\n\r\n John Tyndall, _Faraday as a Discoverer_.\r\n\r\n E. v.

This\r\nevent roused great enthusiasm among scientists as well as in the popular\r\nmind, afforded proof of the reliability of the Newtonian hypothesis, and\r\ndemonstrated the precision to which the calculation of celestial motions\r\nhad attained. Scientific law appeared not merely as a formulation and\r\nexplanation of observed phenomena but as a means for the discovery of\r\nnew truths. \"Would it not be admirable,\" wrote Valz to Arago in 1835,\r\n\"to arrive thus at a knowledge of the existence of a body which cannot\r\nbe perceived?\"\r\n\r\nThe prediction and discovery of Neptune, to which many minds\r\ncontributed, and which has been described with a show of justice as a\r\nmovement of the times, arose from the previous discovery of the planet\r\nUranus by Sir William Herschel in 1781. After that event Bode suggested\r\nthat it was possible other astronomers had observed Uranus before,\r\nwithout recognizing it as a planet. By a study of the star catalogues\r\nthis conjecture was soon verified. It was found that Flamsteed had made,\r\nin 1690, the first observation of the heavenly body now called Uranus.\r\nUltimately it was shown that there were at least seventeen similar\r\nobservations prior to 1781.\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be supposed that these so-called ancient observations\r\nwould lead to a ready determination of the planet's orbit, mass, mean\r\ndistance, longitude with reference to the sun, etc. The contrary,\r\nhowever, seemed to be the case. When Alexis Bouvard, the associate of\r\nLaplace, prepared in 1821 tables of Uranus, Jupiter, and Saturn on the\r\nprinciples of the _Mécanique Céleste_, he was unable to fix an orbit for\r\nUranus which would harmonize with the data of ancient and modern\r\nobservations, that is, those antecedent and subsequent to Herschel's\r\ndiscovery in 1781. If he computed an orbit from the two sets of data\r\ncombined, the requirements of the earlier observations were fairly well\r\nmet, but the later observations were not represented with sufficient\r\nprecision. If on the other hand only the modern data were taken into\r\naccount, tables could be constructed meeting all the observations\r\nsubsequent to 1781, but failing to satisfy those prior to that date. A\r\nconsistent result could be obtained only by sacrificing the modern or\r\nthe ancient observations. \"I have thought it preferable,\" says Bouvard,\r\n\"to abide by the second [alternative], as being that which combines the\r\ngreater number of probabilities in favor of the truth, and I leave it to\r\nthe future to make known whether the difficulty of reconciling the two\r\nsystems result from the inaccuracy of ancient observations, or whether\r\nit depend upon some extraneous and unknown influence, which has acted on\r\nthe planet.\" It was not till three years after the death of Alexis\r\nBouvard that the extraneous influence, of which he thus gave in 1821\r\nsome indication, became fully known.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, however, after the publication of the tables, fresh\r\ndiscrepancies arose between computation and observation. At the first\r\nmeeting of the British Association in 1832 Professor Airy in a paper on\r\nthe _Progress of Astronomy_ showed that observational data in reference\r\nto the planet Uranus diverged widely from the tables of 1821. In 1833\r\nthrough his influence the \"reduction of all the planetary observations\r\nmade at Greenwich from 1750\" was undertaken. Airy became Astronomer\r\nRoyal in 1835, and continued to take special interest in Uranus, laying\r\nparticular emphasis on the fact that the radius vector assigned in the\r\ntables to this planet was much too small.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 the Reverend T. J. Hussey, an amateur astronomer, had written to\r\nAiry in reference to the irregularities in the orbit of Uranus: \"The\r\napparently inexplicable discrepancies between the ancient and modern\r\nobservations suggested to me the possibility of some disturbing body\r\nbeyond Uranus, not taken into account because unknown.... Subsequently,\r\nin conversation with Bouvard, I inquired if the above might not be the\r\ncase.\" Bouvard answered that the idea had occurred to him; indeed, he\r\nhad had some correspondence in reference to it in 1829 with Hansen, an\r\nauthority on planetary perturbations.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Nicolai (as well as Valz) was interested in the\r\nproblem of an ultra-Uranian planet in connection with the orbit of\r\nHalley's comet (itself the subject of a striking scientific prediction\r\nfulfilled in 1758), now reappearing, and under the disturbing influence\r\nof Jupiter. In fact, the probability of the approaching discovery of a\r\nnew planet soon found expression in popular treatises on astronomy. Mrs.\r\nSomerville in her book on _The Connection of the Physical Sciences_\r\n(1836) said that the discrepancies in the records of Uranus might reveal\r\nthe existence and even \"the mass and orbit of a body placed for ever\r\nbeyond the sphere of vision.\" Similarly Mädler in his _Popular\r\nAstronomy_ (1841) took the view that Uranus might have been predicted by\r\nstudy of the perturbations it produced in the orbit of Saturn. Applying\r\nthis conclusion to a body beyond Uranus we, he continued, \"may, indeed,\r\nexpress the hope that analysis will one day or other solemnize this, her\r\nhighest, triumph, making discoveries with the mind's eye in regions\r\nwhere, in our actual state, we are unable to penetrate.\"\r\n\r\nOne should not pass over in this account the labors of Eugène Bouvard,\r\nthe nephew of Alexis, who continued to note anomalies in the orbit of\r\nUranus and to construct new planetary tables till the very eve of the\r\ndiscovery of Neptune. In 1837 he wrote to Airy that the differences\r\nbetween the observations of Uranus and the calculation were large and\r\nwere becoming continually larger: \"Is that owing to a perturbation\r\nbrought about in this planet by some body situated beyond it? I don't\r\nknow, but that's my uncle's opinion.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the distinguished astronomer Bessel declared that attempts to\r\nexplain the discrepancies \"must be based on the endeavor to discover an\r\norbit and a mass for some unknown planet, of such a nature, that the\r\nresulting perturbations of Uranus may reconcile the present want of\r\nharmony in the observations.\" Two years later he undertook researches\r\nin reference to the new planet of whose existence he felt certain. His\r\nlabors, however, were interrupted by the death of his assistant\r\nFlemming, and by his own illness, which proved fatal in 1846, a few\r\nmonths before the actual discovery of Neptune. It is evident that the\r\nquest of the new planet had become general. The error of Uranus still\r\namounted to less than two minutes. This deviation from the computed\r\nplace is not appreciable by the naked eye, yet it was felt, by the\r\nscientific world, to challenge the validity of the Newtonian theory, or\r\nto foreshadow the addition of still another planet to our solar system.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1841, John Couch Adams, a young undergraduate of St. John's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, whose interest had been aroused by reading Airy's\r\npaper on the _Progress of Astronomy_, made note of his resolution to\r\nattempt, after completing his college course, the solution of the\r\nproblem then forming in so many minds. After achieving the B.A. as\r\nsenior wrangler at the beginning of 1843, Adams undertook to \"find the\r\nmost probable orbit and mass of the disturbing body which has acted on\r\nUranus.\" The ordinary problem in planetary perturbations calls for the\r\ndetermination of the effect on a known orbit exerted by a body of known\r\nmass and motion. This was an inverse problem; the perturbation being\r\ngiven, it was required to find the position, mass, and orbit of the\r\ndisturbing planet. The data were further equivocal in that the\r\nelements of the given planet Uranus were themselves in doubt; the\r\nunreliability of its planetary tables, in fact, being the occasion of\r\nthe investigation now undertaken. That thirteen unknown quantities were\r\ninvolved indicates sufficiently the difficulty of the problem.\r\n\r\nAdams started with the assumptions, not improbable, that the orbit of\r\nthe unknown planet was a circle, and that its distance from the sun was\r\ntwice that of Uranus. This latter assumption was in accord with the\r\nso-called \"Bode's Law,\" which taught that a simple numerical\r\nrelationship exists between the planetary distances (4, 7, 10, 16, 28,\r\n52, 100, 196), and that the planets as they lie more remote from the sun\r\ntend to be more nearly double the distance of the next preceding. Adams\r\nwas encouraged, by his first attempt, to undertake a more precise\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nOn his behalf Professor Challis of Cambridge applied to Astronomer Royal\r\nAiry, who furnished the _Reductions of the Planetary Observations_ made\r\nat Greenwich from 1750 till 1830. In his second endeavor Adams assumed\r\nthat the unknown planet had an elliptical orbit. He approached the\r\nsolution gradually, ever taking into account more terms of the\r\nperturbations. In September, 1845, he gave the results to Challis, who\r\nwrote to Airy on the 22d of that month that Adams sought an opportunity\r\nto submit the solution personally to the Astronomer Royal. On the 21st\r\nof October, 1845, the young mathematician, twice disappointed in his\r\nattempt to meet Airy, left at the Royal Observatory a paper containing\r\nthe elements of the new planet. The position assigned to it was within\r\nabout one degree of its actual place.\r\n\r\nOn November 5 Airy wrote to Adams and, among other things, inquired\r\nwhether the solution obtained would account for the errors of the\r\nradius vector as well as for those of heliocentric longitude. For Airy\r\nthis was a crucial question; but to Adams it seemed unessential, and he\r\nfailed to reply.\r\n\r\nBy this time a formidable rival had entered the field. Leverrier at the\r\nrequest of Arago had undertaken to investigate the irregularities in the\r\ntables of Uranus. In September of the same year Eugène Bouvard had\r\npresented new tables of that planet. Leverrier acted very promptly and\r\nsystematically. His first paper on the problem undertaken appeared in\r\nthe _Comptes Rendus_ of the Académie des Sciences November 10, 1845. He\r\nhad submitted to rigorous examination the data in reference to the\r\ndisturbing influence of Jupiter and of Saturn on the orbit of Uranus. In\r\nhis second paper, June 1, 1846, Leverrier reviewed the records of the\r\nancient and modern observations of Uranus (279 in all), subjected\r\nBouvard's tables to severe criticism, and decided that there existed in\r\nthe orbit of Uranus anomalies that could not be accounted due to errors\r\nof observation. There must exist some extraneous influence, hitherto\r\nunknown to astronomers. Some scientists had thought that the law of\r\ngravitation did not hold at the confines of the solar system (others\r\nthat the attractive force of other systems might prove a factor), but\r\nLeverrier rejected this conception. Other theories being likewise\r\ndiscarded he asked: \"Is it possible that the irregularities of Uranus\r\nare due to the action of a disturbing planet, situated in the ecliptic\r\nat a mean distance double that of Uranus? And if so, at what point is\r\nthis planet situated? What is its mass? What are the elements of the\r\norbit which it describes?\" The conclusion reached by the calculations\r\nrecorded in this second paper was that all the so-called anomalies in\r\nthe observations of Uranus could be explained as the perturbation caused\r\nby a planet with a heliocentric longitude of 252° on January 1, 1800.\r\nThis would correspond to 325° January 1, 1847.\r\n\r\nAiry received Leverrier's second paper on June 23, and was struck by the\r\nfact that the French mathematician assigned the same place to the new\r\nplanet as had Adams in the preceding October. He wrote to Leverrier in\r\nreference to the errors of the radius vector and received a satisfactory\r\nand sufficiently compliant reply. At one time the Astronomer Royal had\r\nfelt very skeptical about the possibility of the discovery which his own\r\nlabors had contributed to advance. He had always, to quote his own\r\nrather nebulous statement, considered the correctness of a distant\r\nmathematical result to be the subject of moral rather than of\r\nmathematical evidence. Now that corroboration of Adams's results had\r\narrived, he felt it urgent to make a telescopic examination of that part\r\nof the heavens indicated by the theoretical findings of Adams and\r\nLeverrier. He accordingly wrote to Professor Challis, July 9, requesting\r\nhim to employ for the purpose the great Northumberland equatorial of the\r\nCambridge Observatory.\r\n\r\nProfessor Challis had felt, to use his own language, that it was so\r\nnovel a thing to undertake observations in reliance upon merely\r\ntheoretical deductions, that, while much labor was certain, success\r\nappeared very doubtful. Nevertheless, having received fresh instructions\r\nfrom Adams relative to the theoretical place of the new planet, he\r\nbegan observations July 29. On August 4 in fixing certain reference\r\npoints he noted, but mistook for a star, the new planet. On August 12,\r\nhaving directed the telescope in accordance with Adams's instructions he\r\nagain noted the same heavenly body, as a star. Before Challis had\r\ncompared the results of the observation of August 12 with the results of\r\nan observation of the same region made on July 30, and arrived at the\r\ninference that the body in question, being absent in the latter\r\nobservation, was not a star but a planet, the prize of discovery had\r\nfallen into the hands of another observer.\r\n\r\nOn August 31 had appeared Leverrier's third paper, in which were stated\r\nthe new planet's orbit, mass, distance from the sun, eccentricity, and\r\nlongitude. The true heliocentric longitude was given as 326° 32' for\r\nJanuary 1, 1847. This determination placed the planet about 5° to the\r\neast of star δ of Capricorn. Leverrier said it might be recognized by\r\nits disk, which, moreover, would subtend a certain angle.\r\n\r\nThe systematic and conclusive character of Leverrier's research,\r\nsubmitted to one of the greatest academies of science, carried\r\nconviction to the minds of astronomers. The learned world felt itself on\r\nthe eve of a great discovery. Sir John Herschel, in an address before\r\nthe British Association on September 10, said that the year past had\r\ngiven prospect of a new planet. \"We see it as Columbus saw America from\r\nthe shores of Spain. Its movements have been felt trembling along the\r\nfar-reaching line of our analysis with a certainty hardly inferior to\r\nocular demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 18 Leverrier sent a letter to Dr. Galle, of the Berlin\r\nObservatory, which was provided with a set of star maps, prepared at the\r\ninstance of Bessel. Galle replied one week later. \"The planet, of the\r\nposition of which you gave the indication, really exists. The same day\r\nthat I received your letter [September 23] I found a star of the eighth\r\nmagnitude, which was not inscribed in the excellent map (prepared by Dr.\r\nBremiker) belonging to the collection of star maps of the Royal Academy\r\nof Berlin. The observation of the following day showed decisively that\r\nit was the planet sought.\" It was only 57' from the point predicted.\r\n\r\nArago said that the discovery made by Leverrier was one of the most\r\nbrilliant manifestations of the precision of modern astronomic science.\r\nIt would encourage the best geometers to seek with renewed ardor the\r\neternal truths which, in Pliny's phrase, are latent in the majesty of\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nProfessor Challis received Leverrier's third paper on September 29, and\r\nin the evening turned his magnificent refractor to the part of the\r\nheavens that Leverrier had so definitely and so confidently indicated.\r\nAmong the three hundred stars observed Challis was struck by the\r\nappearance of one which presented a disk and shone with the brightness\r\nof a star of the eighth magnitude. This proved to be the planet. On\r\nOctober 1 Challis heard that the German observer had anticipated him.\r\n\r\nArago, while recognizing the excellent work done by Adams in his\r\ncalculations, thought that the fact that the young mathematician had\r\nfailed to publish his results should deprive him of any share whatever\r\nin the glory of the discovery of the new planet, and that history would\r\nconfirm this definite judgment. Arago named the new planet after the\r\nFrench discoverer, but soon acquiesced in the name Neptune, which has\r\nsince prevailed.\r\n\r\nAiry, in whose possession Adams's results had remained for months\r\nunpublished and unheeded, wrote Leverrier: \"You are to be recognized\r\nbeyond doubt as the predictor of the planet's place.\" A vigorous\r\nofficial himself, Airy was deeply impressed by the calm decisiveness and\r\ndefinite directions of the French mathematician. \"It is here, if I\r\nmistake not, that we see a character far superior to that of the able,\r\nor enterprising, or industrious mathematician; it is here that we see\r\nthe philosopher.\" This explains, if anything could, his view that a\r\ndistant mathematical result is the subject of ethical rather than of\r\nmathematical evidence.\r\n\r\nAdams's friends felt that he had not received from either of the\r\nastronomers, to whom he confided his results, the kind of help or advice\r\nhe should have received. Challis was kindly, but wanting in initiative.\r\nAlthough he had command of the great Northumberland telescope, he had no\r\nthought of commencing the search in 1845, for, without mistrusting the\r\nevidence which the theory gave of the _existence_ of the planet, it\r\nmight be reasonable to suppose that its position was determined but\r\nroughly, and that a search for it must necessarily be long and\r\nlaborious. In the view of Simon Newcomb,[3] Adams's results, which were\r\ndelivered at the Greenwich Observatory October 21, 1845, were so near to\r\nthe mark that a few hours' close search could not have failed to make\r\nthe planet known.\r\n\r\nBoth Adams and Leverrier had assumed as a rough approximation at\r\nstarting that the orbit of the new planet was circular and that, in\r\naccordance with Bode's Law, its distance was twice that of Uranus. S. C.\r\nWalker, of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, was able to\r\ndetermine the elements of the orbit of Neptune accurately in 1847. In\r\nFebruary of that year he had found (as had Petersen of Altona about the\r\nsame time) that Lalande had in May, 1795, observed Neptune and mistaken\r\nit for a fixed star. When Lalande's records in Paris were studied, it\r\nwas found that he had made two observations of Neptune on May 8 and 10.\r\nTheir failure to agree caused the observer to reject one and mark the\r\nother as doubtful. Had he repeated the observation, he might have noted\r\nthat the _star_ moved, and was in reality a planet.\r\n\r\nNeptune's orbit is more nearly circular than that of any of the major\r\nplanets except Venus. Its distance is thirty times that of the earth\r\nfrom the sun instead of thirty-nine times, as Bode's Law would require.\r\nThat generalization was a presupposition of the calculations leading to\r\nthe discovery. It was then rejected like a discredited ladder. Man's\r\nconception of the universe is widened at the thought that the outmost\r\nknown planet of our solar system is about 2,796,000,000 miles from the\r\nsun and requires about 165 years for one revolution.\r\n\r\nProfessor Peirce, of Harvard University, pointing to the difference\r\nbetween the calculations of Leverrier and the facts, put forward the\r\nview that the discovery made by Galle must be regarded as a happy\r\naccident. This view, however, has not been sustained.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Sir Robert Ball, Neptune's Jubilee Year, _Scientific American_,\r\n   Supplement, Oct. 10, 1896.\r\n\r\n Sir Robert Ball, _The Story of the Heavens_, chap.

Brit._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND TRAVEL--THE VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, in his _Principles of Geology_, the first edition of\r\nwhich appeared in 1830-1833, says: \"If it be true that delivery be the\r\nfirst, second, and third requisite in a popular orator, it is no less\r\ncertain that travel is of first, second, and third importance to those\r\nwho desire to originate just and comprehensive views concerning the\r\nstructure of our globe.\" The value of travel to science in general might\r\nvery well be illustrated by Lyell's own career, his study of the\r\nmountainous regions of France, his calculation of the recession of\r\nNiagara Falls and of the sedimentary deposits of the Mississippi, his\r\nobservations of the coal formations of Nova Scotia, and of the\r\ncomposition of the Great Dismal Swamp of Virginia--suggestive of the\r\norganic origin of the carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not with Lyell that we have here principally to deal, it\r\nis not irrelevant to say that the main purpose of his work was to show\r\nthat all past changes in the earth's crust are referable to causes now\r\nin operation. Differing from Hutton as to the part played in those\r\nchanges by subterranean heat, Lyell agreed with his forerunner in\r\nascribing geological transformations to \"the slow agency of existing\r\ncauses.\" He was, in fact, the leader of the uniformitarians and opposed\r\nthose geologists who held that the contemporary state of the earth's\r\ncrust was owing to a series of catastrophes, stupendous exhibitions of\r\nnatural force to which recent history offered no parallel. Also\r\nenlightened as to the significance of organic remains in stratified\r\nrock, Lyell in 1830 felt the need of further knowledge in reference to\r\nthe relation of the plants and animals represented in the fossils to the\r\nfauna and flora now existing.\r\n\r\nIt is to Lyell's disciple, Charles Darwin, however, that we turn for our\r\nmain illustration of the value of travel for comprehensive scientific\r\ngeneralization. Born, like another great liberator, on February 12,\r\n1809, Darwin was only twenty-two years old when he received appointment\r\nas naturalist on H.M.S. Beagle, about to sail from Devonport on a voyage\r\naround the world. The main purpose of the expedition, under command of\r\nthe youthful Captain Fitzroy, three or four years older than Darwin, was\r\nto make a survey of certain coasts in South America and the Pacific\r\nIslands, and to carry a line of chronometrical measurements about the\r\nglobe. Looking back in 1876 on this memorable expedition, the naturalist\r\nwrote, \"The voyage of the Beagle has been by far the most important\r\nevent in my life, and has determined my whole career.\" In spite of the\r\nyears he had spent at school and college he regarded this experience as\r\nthe first real training or education of his mind.\r\n\r\nDarwin had studied medicine at Edinburgh, but found surgery distasteful.\r\nHe moved to Cambridge, with the idea of becoming a clergyman of the\r\nEstablished Church. As a boy he had attended with his mother, daughter\r\nof Josiah Wedgwood, the Unitarian services. At Cambridge he graduated\r\nwithout distinction at the beginning of 1831. It should be said,\r\nhowever, that the traditional studies were particularly ill suited to\r\nhis cast of mind, that he had not been idle, and had developed\r\nparticular diligence in different branches of science, and above all as\r\na collector.\r\n\r\nHe was six feet tall, fond of shooting and hunting, and able to ride\r\nseventy-five or eighty miles without tiring. He had shown himself at\r\ncollege fond of company, and a little extravagant. He was, though a\r\nsportsman, extremely humane; had a horror of inflicting pain, and such\r\nrepugnance at the thought of slavery that he quarreled violently with\r\nCaptain Fitzroy when the latter condoned the abomination. Darwin was\r\nnot, however, of a turbulent disposition. Sir James Sulivan, who had\r\naccompanied the expedition as second lieutenant, said many years after:\r\n\"I can confidently express my belief that during the five years in the\r\nBeagle, he was never known to be out of temper, or to say one unkind or\r\nhasty word _of_ or _to_ any one.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin's father was remarkable for his powers of observation, while the\r\ngrandfather, Erasmus Darwin, is well known for his tendency to\r\nspeculation. Charles Darwin possessed both these mental characteristics\r\nin an eminent degree. One who has conversed with him reports that what\r\nimpressed him most in meeting the great naturalist was his clear blue\r\neyes, which seemed to possess almost telescopic vision, and that the\r\nreally remarkable thing about Darwin was that he saw more than other\r\npeople. At the same time it will scarcely be denied that his vision was\r\nas much marked by insight as by careful observation, that his reasoning\r\nwas logical and singularly tenacious, and his imagination vivid. It was\r\nbefore this supreme seer that the panorama of terrestrial creation was\r\ndisplayed during a five years' voyage.\r\n\r\nNo one can read Darwin's _Journal_ descriptive of the voyage of the\r\nBeagle and continue to entertain any doubts in reference to his æsthetic\r\nsense and poetic appreciation of the various moods of nature. Throughout\r\nthe voyage the scenery was for him the most constant and highest source\r\nof enjoyment. His emotions responded to the glories of tropical\r\nvegetation in the Brazilian forests, and to the sublimity of Patagonian\r\nwastes and the forest-clad hills of Tierra del Fuego. \"It is easy,\"\r\nwrites the gifted adolescent, \"to specify the individual objects of\r\nadmiration in these grand scenes; but it is not possible to give an\r\nadequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, astonishment, and\r\ndevotion, which fill and elevate the mind.\" Similarly, on the heights of\r\nthe Andes, listening to the stones borne seaward day and night by the\r\nmountain torrents, Darwin remarked: \"The sound spoke eloquently to the\r\ngeologist; the thousands and thousands of stones, which striking against\r\neach other, made the one dull uniform sound, were all hurrying in one\r\ndirection. It was like thinking on time, where the minute that now\r\nglides past is irrecoverable. So was it with these stones, the ocean is\r\ntheir eternity, and each note of that wild music told of one more step\r\ntowards their destiny.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Beagle left Devonport, December 27, 1831, the young naturalist\r\nwas without any theory, and when the ship entered Falmouth harbor,\r\nOctober 2, 1836, though he felt the need of a theory in reference to the\r\nrelations of the various species of plants and animals, he had not\r\nformulated one. It was not till 1859 that his famous work on the _Origin\r\nof Species_ appeared. He went merely as a collector, and frequently in\r\nthe course of the voyage felt a young man's misgivings as to whether his\r\ncollections would be of value to his Cambridge professors and other\r\nmature scientists.\r\n\r\nProfessor Henslow, the botanist, through whom Darwin had been offered\r\nthe opportunity to accompany the expedition, had presented his pupil\r\nwith the first volume of Lyell's _Principles of Geology_. (Perhaps,\r\nafter Lyell, the most potent influence on Darwin's mind at this time was\r\nthat of Humboldt and other renowned travelers, whose works he read with\r\navidity.) At the Cape Verde Islands he made some interesting\r\nobservations of a white calcareous stratum which ran for miles along the\r\ncoast at a height of about forty-five feet above the water. It rested on\r\nvolcanic rocks and was itself covered with basalt, that is, lava which\r\nhad crystallized under the sea. It was evident that subsequently to the\r\nformation of the basalt that portion of the coast containing the white\r\nstratum had been elevated. The shells in the stratum were recent, that\r\nis, corresponded to those still to be found on the neighboring coast. It\r\noccurred to Darwin that the voyage might afford material for a book on\r\ngeology. Later in the voyage, having read portions of his _Journal_ to\r\nCaptain Fitzroy, Darwin was encouraged to believe that this also might\r\nprove worthy of publication.\r\n\r\nDarwin's account of his adventures and manifold observations is so\r\ninformal, so rich in detail, as not to admit of summary. His eye took in\r\nthe most diverse phenomena, the color of the sea or of rivers, clouds of\r\nbutterflies and of locusts, the cacique with his little boy clinging to\r\nthe side of a horse in headlong flight, the great earthquake on the\r\ncoast of Chile, the endless variety of plant and animal life, the\r\nsuperstition of savage and _padre_, the charms of Tahiti, the\r\nunconscious humor of his mountain guides for whom at an altitude of\r\neleven thousand feet \"the cursed pot (which was a new one) did not\r\nchoose to boil potatoes\"--all found response in Darwin's open mind;\r\neverything was grist to his mill. Any selection from the richness of the\r\noriginal is almost sure to show a tendency not obvious in the _Journal_.\r\nOn the other hand, it is just such multiplicity of phenomena as the\r\n_Journal_ mirrors that impels every orderly mind to seek for causes, for\r\nexplanation. The human intellect cannot rest till law gives form to the\r\nwild chaos of fact.\r\n\r\nNo disciple of Lyell could fail to be convinced of the immeasurable\r\nlapse of time required for the formation of the earth's crust. For this\r\nprinciple Darwin found abundant evidence during the years spent in South\r\nAmerica. On the heights of the Andes he found marine shell fossils at a\r\nheight of fourteen thousand feet above sea-level. That such an elevation\r\nof submarine strata should be achieved by forces still at Nature's\r\ncommand might well test the faith of the most ardent disciple. Of how\r\ngreat those forces are Darwin received demonstration on the coast of\r\nChile in 1835. Under date of February 12, he writes: \"This day has been\r\nmemorable in the annals of Valdivia for the most severe earthquake\r\nexperienced by the oldest inhabitant.... A bad earthquake destroys our\r\noldest associations; the earth, the very emblem of solidity, has moved\r\nbeneath our feet like a thin crust over a fluid.\" He observed that the\r\nmost remarkable effect of this earthquake was the permanent elevation of\r\nthe land. Around the Bay of Concepcion it was raised two or three feet,\r\nwhile at the island of Santa Maria the elevation was much greater; \"on\r\none part Captain Fitzroy found beds of putrid mussel shells _still\r\nadhering to the rocks_, ten feet above high-water mark.\" On the same day\r\nthe volcanoes of South America were active. The area from under which\r\nvolcanic matter was actually erupted was 720 miles in one line and 400\r\nin another at right angles to it. Great as is the force at work, ages\r\nare required to produce a range of mountains like the Cordilleras;\r\nmoreover, progress is not uniform and subsidence may alternate with\r\nelevation. It was on the principle of the gradual subsidence (and\r\nelevation) of the bed of the Pacific Ocean that Darwin accounted for the\r\nformation of coral reefs. Nothing \"is so unstable as the level of the\r\ncrust of this earth.\"\r\n\r\nClosely associated with the evidence of the immensity of the force of\r\nvolcanic action and the infinitude of time elapsed, Darwin had testimony\r\nof the multitude of plant and animal species, some gigantic, others\r\nalmost infinitely small, some living, others extinct. We know that his\r\nthought was greatly affected by his discovery in Uruguay and Patagonia\r\nof the fossil remains of extinct mammals, all the more so because they\r\nseemed to bear relationship to particular living species and at the same\r\ntime to show likeness to other species. The Toxodon (bow-tooth), for\r\nexample, was a gigantic rodent whose fossil remains were discovered in\r\nthe same region where Darwin found living the capybara, a rodent as\r\nlarge as a pig; at the same time the extinct species showed in its\r\nstructure certain affinities to the Edentata (sloths, ant-eaters,\r\narmadillos). Other fossils represented gigantic forms distinctly of\r\nthe edentate order and comparable to the Cape ant-eater and the\r\nGreat Armadillo (_Dasypus gigas_). Again, remains were found of a\r\nthick-skinned non-ruminant with certain structural likeness to the\r\nCamelidæ, to which the living species of South American ruminants, the\r\n_guanacos_, belong.\r\n\r\nWhy have certain species ceased to exist? As the individual sickens and\r\ndies, so certain species become rare and extinct. Darwin found in\r\nNorthern Patagonia evidence of the _Equus curvidens_, an extinct species\r\nof native American horse. What had caused this species to die out?\r\nImported horses were introduced at Buenos Ayres in 1537, and so\r\nflourished in the wild state that in 1580 they were found as far\r\nsouth as the Strait of Magellan. Darwin was well fitted by the\r\ncomprehensiveness of his observations to deal with the various factors\r\nof extinction and survival. He studied the species in their natural\r\nsetting, the habitat, and range, and habits, and food of the different\r\nvarieties. Traveling for three years and a half north and south on the\r\ncontinent of South America, he noticed one species replacing another,\r\nperhaps closely allied, species. Of the carrion-feeding hawks the condor\r\nhas an immense range, but shows a predilection for perpendicular cliffs.\r\nIf an animal die on the plain the polyborus has prerogative of feeding\r\nfirst, and is followed by the turkey buzzard and the gallinazo. European\r\nhorses and cattle running wild in the Falkland Islands are somewhat\r\nmodified; the horse as a species degenerating, the cattle increasing in\r\nsize and tending to form varieties of different color. The soil being\r\nsoft the hoofs of the horse grow long and produce lameness. Again, on\r\nthe mainland, the niata, a breed of cattle supposed to have originated\r\namong the Indians south of the Plata, are, on account of the projection\r\nof the lower jaw, unable to browse as effectually as other breeds. This\r\nrenders them liable to destruction in times of drought. A similar\r\nvariation in structure had characterized a species of extinct ruminant\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nHow disastrous a great drought might prove to the cattle of the Pampas\r\nis shown by the records of 1825 and of 1830. So little rain fell that\r\nthere was a complete failure of vegetation. The loss of cattle in one\r\nprovince alone was estimated at one million. Of one particular herd of\r\ntwenty thousand not a single one survived. Darwin had many other\r\ninstances of nature's devastations. After the Beagle sailed from the\r\nPlata, December 6, 1833, vast numbers of butterflies were seen as far as\r\nthe eye could range in bands of countless myriads. \"Before sunset a\r\nstrong breeze sprung up from the north, and this must have caused tens\r\nof thousands of the butterflies and other insects to perish.\" Two or\r\nthree months before this he had ocular proof of the effect of a\r\nhailstorm, which in a very limited area killed twenty deer, fifteen\r\nostriches, numbers of ducks, hawks, and partridges. In the war of\r\nextermination that was ever before the great naturalist's eye in South\r\nAmerica, what is it that favors a species' survival or determines its\r\nextinction?\r\n\r\nNot only is the struggle between the animals and inanimate nature, the\r\nplants and inanimate nature, plant and animal, rival animals, and rival\r\nplants; it goes on between man and his environment, and, very fiercely,\r\nbetween man and man. Darwin was moved by intense indignation at the\r\nslavery on the east coast and the cruel oppression of the laborer on the\r\nwest coast. He was in close contact with the sanguinary political\r\nstruggles of South America, and with a war of attempted extermination\r\nagainst the Indian. He refers to the shocking but \"unquestionable fact,\r\nthat [in the latter struggle] all the women who appear above twenty\r\nyears old are massacred in cold blood! When I exclaimed that this\r\nappeared rather inhuman, he [the informant] answered, 'Why, what can be\r\ndone? they breed so!'\"\r\n\r\nIn all his travels nothing that Darwin beheld made a deeper impression\r\non his sensitive mind than primitive man. \"Of individual objects,\r\nperhaps nothing is more certain to create astonishment than the first\r\nsight in his native haunt of a barbarian--of man in his lowest and most\r\nsavage state. One's mind hurries back over past centuries, and then\r\nasks, could our progenitors have been men like these?... I do not\r\nbelieve it is possible to describe or paint the difference between\r\nsavage and civilized man.\" It was at Tierra del Fuego that he was\r\nparticularly shocked. He admired the Tahitians; he pitied the natives of\r\nTasmania, corralled like wild animals and forced to migrate; he thought\r\nthe black aborigines of Australia had been underestimated and remarked\r\nwith regret that their numbers were decreasing through their association\r\nwith civilized man, the introduction of spirits, the increased\r\ndifficulty of procuring food, and contact with European diseases. In\r\nthis last cause tending to bring about extinction there was a mysterious\r\nelement. In Chile his scientific acumen had been baffled in the attempt\r\nto explain the invasion of the strange and dreadful disease hydrophobia.\r\nIn Australia the problem of the transmission to the natives of various\r\ndiseases, even by Europeans in apparent health, confronted his\r\nintelligence. \"The varieties of man seem to act on each other in the\r\nsame way as different specimens of animals--the stronger always\r\nextirpating the weaker.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at Wollaston Island, near Cape Horn, however, that Darwin saw\r\nsavage men held in extremity by the hard conditions of life, and at bay.\r\nThey had neither food, nor shelter, nor clothing. They stood absolutely\r\nnaked as the sleet fell on them and melted. At night, \"naked and\r\nscarcely protected from the wind and rain of this tempestuous climate,\"\r\nthey slept on the wet ground coiled up like animals. They subsisted on\r\nshell fish, putrid whale's blubber, or a few tasteless berries and\r\nfungi. At war, the different tribes are cannibals. Darwin writes, \"It is\r\ncertainly true, that when pressed in winter by hunger, they kill and\r\ndevour their old women before they kill their dogs.\" A native boy, when\r\nasked by a traveler why they do this, had answered, \"Doggies\r\ncatch otters, old women no.\" In such hard conditions what are the\r\ncharacteristics that would determine the survival of individual or\r\ntribe? One might be tempted to lay almost exclusive emphasis on physical\r\nstrength, but Darwin was too wise ultimately to answer thus the\r\nquestion that for six or seven years was forming in his accurate and\r\ndiscriminating mind.\r\n\r\nOn its way west in the Pacific the Beagle spent a month at the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, which lies under the equator five or six hundred miles from\r\nthe mainland. \"Most of the organic productions are aboriginal creations,\r\nfound nowhere else; there is even a difference between the inhabitants\r\nof the different islands; yet all show a marked relationship with those\r\nof America.\" Why should the plants and animals of the islands resemble\r\nthose of the mainland, or the inhabitants of one island differ from\r\nthose of a neighboring island? Darwin had always held that species were\r\ncreated immutable, and that it was impossible for one species to give\r\nrise to another.\r\n\r\nIn the Galapagos Archipelago he found only one species of terrestrial\r\nmammal, a new species of mouse, and that only on the most easterly\r\nisland of the group. On the South American continent there were at least\r\nforty species of mice, those east of the Andes being distinct from those\r\non the west coast. Of land-birds he obtained twenty-six kinds,\r\ntwenty-five of which were to be found nowhere else. Among these, a hawk\r\nseemed in structure intermediate between the buzzard and polyborus, as\r\nthough it had been modified and induced to take over the functions of\r\nthe South American carrion-hawk. There were three species of\r\nmocking-thrush, two of them confined to one island each. There were\r\nthirteen species of finches, all peculiar to the archipelago. In the\r\ndifferent species of geospiza there is a perfect gradation in the size\r\nof the beaks, only to be appreciated by seeing the specimens or their\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nFew of the birds were of brilliant coloration. The same was true of the\r\nplants and insects. Darwin looked in vain for one brilliant flower. This\r\nwas in marked contrast to the fauna and flora of the South American\r\ntropics. The coloration of the species suggested comparison with that of\r\nthe plants and animals of Patagonia. Amid brilliant tropical plants\r\nbrilliant plumage may afford means of concealment, as well as being a\r\nfactor in the securing of mates.\r\n\r\nDarwin found the reptiles the most striking feature of the zoölogy of\r\nthe islands. They seem to take the place of the herbivorous mammalia.\r\nThe huge tortoise (_Testudo nigra_) native in the archipelago is so\r\nheavy as to be lifted only by six or eight men. (The young naturalist\r\nfrequently got on the back of a tortoise, but as it moved forward under\r\nhis encouragement, he found it very difficult to keep his balance.)\r\nDifferent varieties, if not species, characterize the different islands.\r\nOf the other reptilia should be noted two species of lizard of a genus\r\n(_Amblyrhynchus_) confined to the Galapagos Islands. One, aquatic, a\r\nyard long, fifteen pounds in weight, with \"limbs and strong claws\r\nadmirably adapted for crawling over the rugged and fissured masses of\r\nlava,\" feeds on seaweed. When frightened it instinctively shuns the\r\nwater, as though it feared especially its aquatic enemies. The\r\nterrestrial species is confined to the central part of the group; it is\r\nsmaller than the aquatic species, and feeds on cactus, leaves of trees,\r\nand berries.\r\n\r\nFifteen new species of sea-fish were obtained, distributed in twelve\r\ngenera. The archipelago, though not rich in insects, afforded several\r\nnew genera, each island with its distinct kinds. The flora of the\r\nGalapagos Islands proved equally distinctive. More than half of the\r\nflowering plants are native, and the species of the different islands\r\nshow wonderful differences. For example, of seventy-one species found on\r\nJames Island thirty-eight are confined to the archipelago and thirty to\r\nthis one island.\r\n\r\nIn October the Beagle sailed west to Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia,\r\nKeeling or Cocos Islands, Mauritius, St. Helena, Ascension; arrived at\r\nBahia, Brazil, August 1, 1836; and finally proceeded from Brazil to\r\nEngland. Among his many observations, Darwin noted the peculiar\r\nanimals of Australia, the kangaroo-rat, and \"several of the famous\r\n_Ornithorhynchus paradoxus_,\" or duckbill. On the Keeling or Cocos\r\nIslands the chief vegetable production is the cocoanut. Here Darwin\r\nobserved crabs of monstrous size, with a structure which enabled them to\r\nopen the cocoanuts. They thus secured their food, and accumulated\r\n\"surprising quantities of the picked fibres of the cocoanut husk, on\r\nwhich they rest as a bed.\"\r\n\r\nIn preparing his _Journal_ for publication in the autumn of 1836 the\r\nyoung naturalist saw how many facts pointed to the common descent of\r\nspecies. He thought that by collecting all facts that bore on the\r\nvariation of plants and animals, wild or domesticated, light might be\r\nthrown on the whole subject. \"I worked on true Baconian principles, and,\r\nwithout any theory, collected facts on a wholesale scale.\" He saw that\r\npigeon-fanciers and stock-breeders develop certain types by preserving\r\nthose variations that have the desired characteristics. This is a\r\nprocess of artificial selection. How is selection made by Nature?\r\n\r\nIn 1838 he read Malthus' _Essay on the Principle of Population_, which\r\nshowed how great and rapid, without checks like war and disease, the\r\nincrease in number of the human race would be. He had seen something in\r\nhis travels of rivalry for the means of subsistence. He now perceived\r\n\"that under these circumstances favorable variations would tend to be\r\npreserved, and unfavorable ones to be destroyed. The results of this\r\nwould be the formation of a new species.\" As special breeds are\r\ndeveloped by artificial selection, so new species evolve by a process of\r\nnatural selection. Those genera survive which give rise to species\r\nadapted to new conditions of existence.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, before Darwin had published his theory, he received from\r\nanother great traveler, Alfred Russel Wallace, then at Ternate in the\r\nMoluccas, a manuscript essay, setting forth an almost identical view of\r\nthe development of new species through the survival of the fittest in\r\nthe struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Charles Darwin, _A Naturalist's Journal_.\r\n\r\n Francis Darwin, _The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin_.\r\n\r\n W.

In the\r\nactivities of naval and military equipment and organization this\r\ninfluence is obvious enough; it is no less real in the reaction from war\r\nwhich impels all to turn with new zest to the arts and industries of\r\npeace and to cherish whatever may tend to culture and civil progress.\r\nNot infrequently war gives rise, not only to new educational ideals, but\r\nto new institutions and to new types of institution favorable to the\r\nadvancement of science. As we have already seen, the Royal Society and\r\nMilton's Academies owed their origin to the Great Rebellion. Similarly\r\nthe Ecole Polytechnique, mother of many scientific discoveries, rose in\r\nanswer to the needs of the French Revolution. No less noteworthy was the\r\nreconstruction of education under the practical genius of Napoleon I,\r\nthe division of France into académies, the founding of the lycées, the\r\nreëstablishment of the great Ecole Normale, and the organization of the\r\nImperial University with new science courses and new provincial\r\nFaculties at Rennes, Lille, and elsewhere. With all these different\r\nforms in which the influence of war makes itself felt in the progress of\r\nscience the life and career of Louis Pasteur (1822-1895), the founder\r\nof bacteriology, stood intimately associated.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Dôle, but the family a few years later settled at Arbois.\r\nFor three generations the Pasteurs had been tanners in the Jura, and\r\nthey naturally adhered to that portion of the population which hailed\r\nthe Revolution as a deliverance. The great-grandfather was the first\r\nfreeman of Pasteur's forbears, having purchased with money his\r\nemancipation from serfdom. The father in 1811, at the age of twenty, was\r\none of Napoleon's conscripts, and in 1814 received from the Emperor, for\r\nvalor and fidelity, the Cross of the Legion of Honor. The directness and\r\nendurance of the influence of this trained veteran on his gifted son a\r\nhundred fine incidents attest. In 1848--year of revolt in the monarchies\r\nof Europe--the young scientist enrolled himself in the National Guard,\r\nand, seeing one day in the Place du Panthéon a structure inscribed with\r\nthe words _autel de la patrie_, he placed upon it all the humble\r\nmeans--one hundred and fifty francs--then at his disposal.\r\n\r\nIt was in that same year that Pasteur put on record his discovery of the\r\nnature of racemic acid, his first great service to science, from which\r\nall his other services were to proceed. As a boy he had attended the\r\n_collège_ at Arbois where his teacher had inspired him with an ambition\r\nto enter the great Ecole Normale. Before reaching that goal he took his\r\nbachelor's degree in science as well as in arts at the Besançon college.\r\nAt Paris he came in contact with the leaders of the scientific\r\nworld--Claude Bernard, Balard, Dumas, Biot.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Biot had entered the ranks of science by way of the Ecole\r\nPolytechnique and the artillery service. In 1819 he had announced that\r\nthe plane of polarized light--for example, a ray passed through Iceland\r\nspar--is deflected to right or left by various chemical substances.\r\nAmong these is common tartaric acid--the acid of grape-juice, obtained\r\nfrom wine lees. Racemic acid, however, which is identical with tartaric\r\nacid in its chemical constituents, is optically inactive, rotating the\r\nplane of polarized light neither to the right nor the left. This\r\nsubstance Pasteur subjected to special investigation. He scrutinized the\r\ncrystals of sodium ammonium racemate obtained from aqueous solution.\r\nThese he observed to be of two kinds differing in form as a right glove\r\nfrom a left, or as an object from its mirror-image. Separating the\r\ncrystals according to the difference of form, he made a solution from\r\neach group. One solution, tested in the polarized-light apparatus,\r\nturned the plane to the right; the other solution turned it to the left.\r\nHe had made a capital discovery of far-reaching importance, namely, that\r\nracemic acid is composite, consisting of dextro-tartaric and\r\nlævo-tartaric acids. Biot hesitated to credit a mere tyro with such an\r\nachievement. The experiment was repeated in his presence. Convinced by\r\nocular demonstration, he was almost overcome with emotion. \"My dear\r\nboy,\" he exclaimed, \"I have loved the sciences so much my life through\r\nthat that makes my heart jump.\"\r\n\r\nPasteur began his regular professional experience as a teacher of\r\nphysics in the Dijon lycée, but he was soon transferred to the\r\nUniversity of Strasburg (1849). There he married the daughter of the\r\nrector of the académie, and three years later became Professor of\r\nChemistry. In 1854 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Sciences at\r\nLille, a town then officially described as the richest center of\r\nindustrial activity in the north of France. In his opening address he\r\nshowed the value and attractiveness of practical studies. He believed as\r\nan educator in the close alliance of laboratory and factory. Application\r\nshould always be the aim, but resting on the severe and solid basis of\r\nscientific principles; for it is theory alone which can bring forth and\r\ndevelop the spirit of invention.\r\n\r\nHis own study of racemic acid, begun in the laboratories of Paris, and\r\nfollowed up in the factories of Leipzig, Prag, and Vienna, had led to\r\nhis theory of molecular dissymmetry, the starting point of modern\r\nstereo-chemistry. It now gave rise on Pasteur's part to new studies and\r\nto new applications to the industries. He tried an experiment which\r\nseems almost whimsical, placing ammonium racemate in the ordinary\r\nconditions of fermentation, and observed that only one part--the\r\ndextro-rotatory--ferments or putrefies. Why? \"Because the ferments of\r\nthat fermentation feed more easily on the right hand than on the left\r\nhand molecules.\" He succeeded in keeping alive one of the commonest\r\nmoulds on the surface of ashes and racemic acid, and saw the\r\nlævo-tartaric acid appear. It was thus that he passed from the study of\r\ncrystals to the study of ferments.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century little was known of the nature\r\nof fermentation, though some sought to explain by this ill-understood\r\nprocess the origin of various diseases and of putrefaction. Why does\r\nfruit-juice produce alcohol, wine turn to vinegar, milk become sour, and\r\nbutter rancid? Pasteur's interest in these problems of fermentation was\r\nstimulated by one of the industries of Lille. He was accustomed to visit\r\nwith his students the factories of that place as well as those of\r\nneighboring French and Belgian cities. The father of one of his students\r\nwas engaged in the manufacture of alcohol from beetroot sugar,\r\nand Pasteur came to be consulted when difficulties arose in the\r\nmanufacturing process. He discovered a relationship between the\r\ndevelopment of the yeast and the success or failure of the fermentation,\r\nthe yeast globules as seen under the microscope showing an alteration of\r\nform when the fermentation was not proceeding satisfactorily. In 1857\r\nPasteur on the basis of this study was able to demonstrate that\r\nalcoholic fermentation, that is, the conversion of sugar into alcohol,\r\ncarbonic acid, and other compounds, depends on the action of yeast, the\r\ncells of which are widely disseminated in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn this year of his second great triumph Pasteur was appointed director\r\nof science studies in the Ecole Normale, from which he had graduated in\r\n1847. Two years later the loss of his daughter by a communicable\r\ndisease--typhoid fever--had a great effect on his sensitive and profound\r\nmind. Many of his opponents, it is true, found Pasteur implacable in\r\ncontroversy. Undoubtedly he had the courage of his convictions, and his\r\nbelief that, for the sake of human welfare, right views--_his_ views won\r\nby tireless experiment--must prevail, gained him the name of a fighter.\r\nBut in all the intimate relations of life his essential tenderness was\r\nmanifest. Like Darwin he had a horror of inflicting pain, and always\r\ninsisted, when operations on animals were necessary in the laboratory,\r\non the use of anæsthetics (our command of which had been greatly\r\nadvanced by Simpson in 1847). Emile Roux said that Pasteur's agitation\r\nat witnessing the slightest exhibition of pain would have been ludicrous\r\nif, in so great a man, it had not been touching.\r\n\r\nA few months after his daughter's death Pasteur wrote to one of his\r\nfriends: \"I am pursuing as best I can these studies on fermentation,\r\nwhich are of great interest, connected as they are with the impenetrable\r\nmystery of life and death. I am hoping to make a decisive advance very\r\nsoon, by solving without the least lack of clearness the famous question\r\nof spontaneous generation.\" Two years previously a scientist had claimed\r\nthat animals and plants could be generated in a medium of artificial air\r\nor oxygen, from which all atmospheric air and all germs of organized\r\nbodies had been precluded. Pasteur now filtered atmospheric air through\r\na plug of cotton or asbestos (a procedure which had been followed by\r\nothers in 1854), and proved that in air thus treated no fermentation\r\ntakes place. Nothing in the atmosphere causes life except the\r\nmicro-organisms it contains. He even demonstrated that a putrescible\r\nfluid like blood will remain unchanged in an open vessel so constructed\r\nas to exclude atmospheric dust.\r\n\r\nPasteur's critics maintained that if putrefaction and fermentation be\r\ncaused solely by microscopic organisms, then these must be found\r\neverywhere and in such quantities as to encumber the air. He replied\r\nthat they were less numerous in some parts of the atmosphere than in\r\nothers. To prove his contention he set out for Arbois with a large\r\nnumber of glass bulbs each half filled with a putrescible liquid. The\r\nnecks of the bulbs had been drawn out and hermetically sealed after the\r\ncontents had been boiled. In case the necks were broken (to be again\r\nsealed immediately), the air would rush in, and (if it held the\r\nrequisite micro-organisms) furnish the conditions for putrefaction. It\r\nwas found that in every trial the contents of a certain number of the\r\nbulbs always escaped alteration. Twenty were opened in the country near\r\nArbois free from human habitations. Eight out of the twenty showed signs\r\nof putrefaction. Twenty were exposed to the air on the heights of the\r\nJura at an altitude of eight hundred and fifty meters above sea-level;\r\nthe contents of five of these subsequently putrefied. Twenty others were\r\nopened near Mont Blanc at an altitude of two thousand meters and while a\r\nwind was blowing from the Mer de Glace; in this case the contents of\r\nonly one of the bulbs became putrefied.\r\n\r\nWhile his opponents still professed to believe in the creation of\r\norganized beings lacking parents, Pasteur was under the influence of the\r\ntheory of \"the slow and progressive transformation of one species into\r\nanother,\" and was becoming aware of phases of the struggle for existence\r\nhitherto shrouded in mystery. He wished he said to push these studies\r\nfar enough to prepare the way for a serious investigation of the origin\r\nof disease.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the study of lactic fermentation, showed that butyric\r\nfermentation may be caused by organisms which live in the absence of\r\noxygen, while vinegar is produced from wine through the agency of\r\nbacteria freely supplied with the oxygen of the air. Pasteur was seeing\r\never more clearly the part played by the infinitesimally small in the\r\neconomy of nature. Without these microscopic beings life would become\r\nimpossible, because death would be incomplete. On the basis of Pasteur's\r\nstudy of fermentation, his demonstration that decomposition is owing to\r\nliving organisms and that minute forms of life spring from parents like\r\nthemselves, his disciple Joseph Lister began in 1864 to develop\r\nantiseptic surgery.\r\n\r\nPasteur's attention was next directed to the wine industry, which then\r\nhad an annual value to France of 500,000,000 francs. Might not the\r\nacidity, bitterness, defective flavor, which were threatening the\r\nforeign sale of French wines, be owing to ferments? He discovered that\r\nthis was, indeed, the case, and that the diseases of wine could be cured\r\nby the simple expedient of heating the liquor for a few moments to a\r\ntemperature of 50° to 60° C. Tests on a considerable scale were made by\r\norder of the naval authorities. The ship Jean Bart before starting on a\r\nvoyage took on board five hundred liters of wine, half of which had been\r\nheated under Pasteur's directions. At the end of ten months the\r\n_pasteurized_ wine was mellow and of good color, while the wine which\r\nhad not been heated had an astringent, almost bitter, taste. A more\r\nextensive test--seven hundred hectoliters, of which six hundred and\r\nfifty had been pasteurized--was carried out on the frigate la Sibylle\r\nwith satisfactory results. Previously wines had been preserved by the\r\naddition of alcohol, which made them both dearer and more detrimental to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Pasteur was called upon to exercise his scientific acumen on\r\nbehalf of the silk industry. A disease--_pébrine_--had appeared among\r\nsilkworms in 1845. In 1849 the effect on the French industry was\r\ndisastrous. In the single _arrondissement_ of Alais an annual income of\r\n120,000,000 francs was lost for the subsequent fifteen years. The\r\nmulberry plantations of the Cévennes were abandoned and the whole region\r\nwas desolate. Pasteur, at the instigation of the Minister of\r\nAgriculture, undertook an investigation. After four or five years, in\r\nspite of repeated domestic afflictions and the breakdown of his own\r\nhealth, he arrived at a successful conclusion. _Pébrine_, due to\r\n\"corpuscles\" readily detected under the microscope, could be recognized\r\nat the moment of the moth's formation. A second disease, _flacherie_,\r\nwas due to a micro-organism found in the digestive cavity of the moth.\r\nMeasures were taken to select the seed of the healthy moths and to\r\ndestroy the others. These investigations revealed the infinitesimally\r\nsmall as disorganizers of living tissue, and brought Pasteur nearer his\r\npurpose \"of arriving,\" as he had expressed it to Napoleon III in 1863,\r\n\"at the knowledge of the causes of putrid and contagious diseases.\"\r\n\r\nReturning in July, 1870, from a visit to Liebig at Munich, Pasteur heard\r\nat Strasburg of the imminence of war. All his dreams of conquest over\r\ndisease and death seemed to vanish. He hurried to Paris. His son,\r\neighteen years of age, set out with the army. Every student of the\r\nEcole Normale enlisted. Pasteur's laboratory was used to house soldiers.\r\nHe himself wished to be enrolled in the National Guard, and had to be\r\ntold that a half-paralyzed man could not render military service. He was\r\nobsessed with horror of wanton bloodshed and with indignation at the\r\ninsolence of armed injustice. Trained to serve his country only in one\r\nway he tried, but in vain, to resume his researches. He retired to the\r\nold home town of Arbois, and sought to distract his mind from the\r\ncontemplation of human baseness. Arbois was entered by the enemy in\r\nJanuary with the usual atrocities of war. Pasteur accompanied by wife\r\nand daughter had gone in search of his son, sick at Pontarlier. The boy\r\nwas restored to health and returned to his regiment the following month.\r\n\r\nDuring this crisis Pasteur and his friends felt, as many English\r\nscientists feel in 1917, in reference to ignorance in high places. \"We\r\nare paying the penalty,\" he said, \"of fifty years' forgetfulness of\r\nscience, and of its conditions of development.\" Again he speaks, as\r\nEnglishmen to-day very well might, of the neglect, disdain even, of the\r\ncountry for great intellectual men, especially in the realm of exact\r\nscience. In the same strain his friend Bertin said that after the war\r\neverything would have to be rebuilt from the top to the bottom, the top\r\nespecially. Pasteur recalled the period of 1792 when Lavoisier,\r\nBerthollet, Monge, Fourcroy, Guyton de Morveau, Chaptal, Clouet, and\r\nother scientists had furnished France with gunpowder, steel, cannon,\r\nfortifications, balloons, leather, and other means to repel unjust\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nOn the day after Sedan the Quaker surgeon Lister had published\r\ndirections for the use of aqueous solutions of carbolic acid to destroy\r\nseptic particles in wounds, and of oily solutions \"to prevent\r\nputrefactive fermentation from without.\" He recognized that the earlier\r\nthe case comes from the field the greater the prospect of success.\r\nSédillot (the originator of the term \"microbe\"), at the head of an\r\nambulance corps in Alsace, was a pioneer in the rapid transport of\r\nwounded from the field of battle. He knew the horrors of purulent\r\ninfection in military hospitals, and regretted that the principles of\r\nPasteur and Lister were not more fully applied.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over, Pasteur kept repeating his life-long\r\nexhortation: We must work--\"_Travaillez, travaillez toujours!_\" He\r\napplied himself to a study of the brewing industry. He did not believe\r\nin spontaneous alterations, but found that every marked change in the\r\nquality of beer coincides with the development of micro-organisms. He\r\nwas able to tell the English brewers the defects in their output by a\r\nmicroscopic examination of their yeast. (\"We must make some friends for\r\nour beloved France,\" he said.) Bottled beer could be pasteurized by\r\nbringing it to a temperature of 50° to 55° C. Whenever beer contains no\r\nferments it is unalterable. His scrupulous mind was coming ever closer\r\nto the goal of his ambition. This study of the diseases of beer led him\r\nnearer to a knowledge of infections. Many micro-organisms may, _must_,\r\nbe detrimental to the health of man and animals.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the Government conferred upon Pasteur a life annuity of twelve\r\nthousand francs, an equivalent of his salary as Professor of Chemistry\r\nat the Sorbonne. (He had received appointment in 1867, but had been\r\ncompelled by ill-health to relinquish his academic functions.) The grant\r\nwas in all respects wise. Huxley remarked that Pasteur's discoveries\r\nalone would suffice to cover the war indemnity of five milliards paid by\r\nFrance to Germany in 1871. Moreover, all his activities were dictated by\r\npatriotic motives. He felt that science is of no country and that its\r\nconquests belong to mankind, but that the scientist must be a patriot in\r\nthe service of his native land.\r\n\r\nPasteur now applied his energies to the study of virulent diseases,\r\nfollowing the principles of his earlier investigations. He opposed those\r\nphysicians who believed in the spontaneity of disease, and he wished to\r\nwage a war of extermination against all injurious organisms. As early as\r\n1850 Davaine and Rayer had shown that a rod-like micro-organism was\r\nalways present in the blood of animals dying of anthrax, a disease which\r\nwas destroying the flocks and herds of France. Dr. Koch, who had served\r\nin the Franco-Prussian War, succeeded in 1876 in obtaining pure cultures\r\nof this bacillus and in defining its relation to the disease. Pasteur\r\ntook up the study of anthrax in 1877, verified previous discoveries,\r\nand, as we shall see, sought means for the prevention of this pest. He\r\ndiscovered (with Joubert and Chamberland) the bacillus of malignant\r\nedema. He applied the principles of bacteriology to the treatment of\r\npuerperal fever, which in 1864 had rendered fatal 310 cases out of 1350\r\nconfinements in the Maternité in Paris. Here he had to fight against\r\nconservatism in the medical profession, and he fought strenuously, one\r\nof his disciples remarking that it is characteristic of lofty minds to\r\nput passion into ideas. Swine plague, which in the United States in 1879\r\ndestroyed over a million hogs, and chicken cholera, also engaged his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nCultures of chicken cholera virus kept for some time became less active.\r\nA hen that chanced to be inoculated with the weakened virus developed\r\nthe disease, but, after a time, recovered (much as patients after the\r\nold-time smallpox inoculations). It was then inoculated with a fresh\r\nculture supposed sufficient to cause death. It again recovered. The use\r\nof the weakened inoculation had developed its resistance to infection. A\r\nweakened virus recovered its strength when passed through a number of\r\nsparrows, the second being inoculated with virus from the first, the\r\nthird from the second, and so on (this species being subject to the\r\ndisease). Hens that had not had chicken cholera could be rendered immune\r\nby a series of attenuated inoculations gradually increasing in strength.\r\nIn the case of anthrax the virus could be weakened by keeping it at a\r\ncertain temperature, while it could be strengthened by passage through a\r\nsuccession of guinea-pigs. There are of course many instances where\r\npathogenic bacteria lose virulence in passing from one animal to\r\nanother, the human smallpox virus, for example, producing typical cowpox\r\nin an inoculated heifer. These facts help to explain why certain\r\ninfections have grown less virulent in the course of history, and why\r\ninfections of which civilized man has become tolerant prove fatal when\r\nimparted to the primitive peoples of Australia.\r\n\r\nPasteur's preventive inoculation for anthrax was tested under dramatic\r\ncircumstances at Melun in June, 1881. Sixty sheep and a number of cows\r\nwere subjected to experiment. None of the sheep that had been given the\r\npreventive treatment died from the crucial inoculation; while all those\r\nsuccumbed which had not received previous treatment. The test for the\r\ncows was likewise successful. Pasteur thought that in places where sheep\r\ndead of anthrax had been buried, the microbes were brought to the\r\nsurface in the castings of earthworms. Hence he issued certain\r\ndirections to prevent the transmission of the disease. He also aided\r\nagriculture by discovering a vaccine for swine plague.\r\n\r\nWhen Pasteur at the age of fifteen was in Paris, overcome with\r\nhomesickness, he had exclaimed, \"If I could only get a whiff of the old\r\ntannery yard, I feel I should be cured.\" Certainly every time he came in\r\ncontact with the industries--silk, wine, beer, wool--his scientific\r\ninsight, Antæus-like, seemed to revive. All his life he had preached the\r\ndoctrine of interchange of service between theory and practice, science\r\nand the occupations. What he did is more eloquent than words. His theory\r\nof molecular dissymmetry, that the atoms in a molecule may be arranged\r\nin left-hand and right-hand spirals or other tridimensional figures\r\ncorresponding to asymmetrical crystals, touches the abstruse question of\r\nthe constitution of matter. His preventive treatment breathes new life\r\ninto the old dictum _similia similibus curantur_. The view he adopted of\r\nthe gradual transformation of species offers a new interpretation of the\r\nspeculations of philosophy in reference to being and becoming and the\r\nrelation of the real to the concrete. Yet Pasteur felt he could learn\r\nmuch of value from the simplest shepherd or vine-dresser.\r\n\r\nHe was complete in the simplicity of his affections, in his compassion\r\nfor all suffering, in the warmth of his religious faith, and in his\r\ndevotion to his country. He thought France was to regain her place in\r\nthe world's esteem through scientific progress. He was therefore\r\nespecially gratified in August, 1881, at the thunders of applause which\r\ngreeted his appearance at the International Medical Congress in London.\r\nThere he was introduced to the Prince of Wales (_fondateur de l'Entente\r\nCordiale_), \"to whom I bowed, saying that I was happy to salute a friend\r\nof France.\"\r\n\r\nPasteur's investigation of rabies began in this same year. Difficulty\r\nwas found in isolating the microbe of the rabic virus, but an\r\ninoculation from the medulla oblongata of a mad dog injected into one of\r\nthe brain membranes (dura mater) of another dog invariably brought on\r\nthe symptoms of rabies. To obtain attenuation of the virus it was\r\nsufficient to dry the medulla taken from an infected rabbit. The\r\nweakened virus increased in strength when cultivated in a series of\r\nrabbits. Pasteur obtained in inoculations of graded virulence, which\r\ncould be administered hypodermically, a means of prophylaxis after\r\nbites. He conjectured that in vaccinal immunity the virus is accompanied\r\nby a substance which makes the nervous tissue unfavorable for the\r\ndevelopment of the microbe.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1885 that he ventured to use his discovery to prevent\r\nhydrophobia. On July 6 a little boy, Joseph Meister, from a small place\r\nin Alsace was brought by his mother to Paris for treatment. He had been\r\nseverely bitten by a mad dog. Pasteur, with great trepidation, but moved\r\nby his usual compassion, undertook the case. The inoculations of the\r\nattenuated virus began at once. The boy suffered little inconvenience,\r\nplaying about the laboratory during the ten days the treatment lasted.\r\nPasteur was racked with fears alternating with hopes, his anxiety\r\ngrowing more intense as the virulence of the inoculations increased. On\r\nAugust 20, however, even he was convinced that the treatment was a\r\ncomplete success. In October a shepherd lad, who, though badly bitten\r\nhimself, had saved some other children from the attack of a rabid dog,\r\nwas the second one to benefit by the great discovery. Pasteur's exchange\r\nof letters with these boys after they had returned to their homes\r\nreveals the kindliness of his disposition. His sentiment toward children\r\nhad regard both to what they were and to what they might become. One\r\npatient, brought to him thirty-seven days after being bitten, he failed\r\nto save. By March 1 Pasteur reported that three hundred and fifty cases\r\nhad been treated with only one death.\r\n\r\nWhen subscriptions were opened for the erection and endowment of the\r\nPasteur Institute, a sum of 2,586,680 francs was received in\r\ncontributions from many different parts of the world. Noteworthy among\r\nthe contributors were the Emperor of Brazil, the Czar of Russia, the\r\nSultan of Turkey, and the peasants of Alsace. On November 14, 1888,\r\nPresident Carnot opened the institution, which was soon to witness the\r\ntriumphs of Roux, Yersin, Metchnikoff, and other disciples of Pasteur.\r\nIn the address prepared for this occasion the veteran scientist wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"If I might be allowed, M. le Président, to conclude by a philosophical\r\nremark, inspired by your presence in this home of work, I should say\r\nthat two contrary laws seem to be wrestling with each other at the\r\npresent time; the one a law of blood and death, ever devising new means\r\nof destruction and forcing nations to be constantly ready for the\r\nbattlefield--the other, a law of peace, work, and health, ever\r\ndeveloping new means of delivering man from the scourges which beset\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"The one seeks violent conquests, the other the relief of humanity. The\r\nlatter places one human life above any victory; while the former would\r\nsacrifice hundreds and thousands of lives to the ambition of one. The\r\nlaw of which we are the instruments seeks, even in the midst of carnage,\r\nto cure the sanguinary ills of the law of war; the treatment inspired by\r\nour antiseptic methods may preserve thousands of soldiers. Which of\r\nthese two laws will ultimately prevail God alone knows. But we may\r\nassert that French science will have tried, by obeying the law of\r\nhumanity, to extend the frontiers of life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n W. W.

All preceding centuries--less glorious than the\r\nnineteenth--can claim but seven or eight capital inventions: (1)\r\nAlphabetic writing; (2) Arabic numerals; (3) the mariner's compass; (4)\r\nprinting; (5) the telescope; (6) the barometer and thermometer; (7) the\r\nsteam engine. Similarly, to the nineteenth century thirteen important\r\ntheoretical discoveries are ascribed, to the eighteenth only two, and to\r\nthe seventeenth five.\r\n\r\nOf course the very purpose of these lists--namely, to compare the\r\nachievements of one century with those of other centuries--inclines us\r\nto view each invention as an isolated phenomenon, disregarding its\r\nantecedents and its relation to contemporary inventions. Studied in its\r\ndevelopment, steam navigation is but an application of one kind of steam\r\nengine, and, moreover, must be viewed as a phase in the evolution of\r\nnavigation since the earliest times. Like considerations would\r\napply to railways, antiseptic surgery, or friction matches. The\r\nnineteenth-century inventor of the friction match was certainly no more\r\ningenious (considering the means that chemistry had put at his disposal)\r\nthan many of the savages who contributed by their intelligence to\r\nmethods of producing, maintaining, and using fire. In fact, as we\r\napproach the consideration of prehistoric times it becomes difficult to\r\ndistinguish inventions from the slow results of development--in\r\nmetallurgy, tool-making, building, pottery, war-gear, weaving, cooking,\r\nthe domestication of animals, the selection and cultivation of plants.\r\nMoreover, it is scarcely in the category of invention that the\r\nacquisition of alphabetic writing or the use of Arabic numerals properly\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nThese and other objections, such as the omission of explosives,\r\nfirearms, paper, will readily occur to the reader. Nevertheless, these\r\nlists, placed side by side with the record of theoretic discoveries,\r\nencourage the belief that, more and more, sound theory is productive of\r\nuseful inventions, and that henceforth it must fall to scientific\r\nendeavor rather than to lucky accident to strengthen man's control over\r\nNature. Even as late as the middle of the nineteenth century accident\r\nand not science was regarded as the fountain-head of invention, and the\r\nview that a knowledge of the causes and secret motions of things would\r\nlead to \"the enlarging of the bounds of human empire to the effecting of\r\nall things possible\" was scouted as the idle dream of a doctrinaire.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1896 three important advances were made in man's mastery of\r\nhis environment. These are associated with the names of Marconi,\r\nBecquerel, and Langley. It was in this year that the last-named,\r\nlong known to the scientific world for his discoveries in solar\r\nphysics, demonstrated in the judgment of competent witnesses the\r\npracticability of mechanical flight. This was the result of nine years'\r\nexperimentation. It was followed by several more years of fruitful\r\ninvestigation, leading to that ultimate triumph which it was given to\r\nSamuel Pierpont Langley to see only with the eye of faith.\r\n\r\nThe English language has need of a new word (\"plane\") to signify the\r\nfloating of a bird upon the wing with slight, or no, apparent motion of\r\nthe wings (_planer_, _schweben_). _To hover_ has other connotations,\r\nwhile _to soar_ is properly to fly upward, and not to hang poised upon\r\nthe air. The miracle of a bird's flight, that steady and almost\r\neffortless motion, had interested Langley intensely--as had also the\r\nsun's radiation--from the years of his childhood. The phenomenon (the\r\nway of an eagle in the air) has always, indeed, fascinated the human\r\nimagination and at the same time baffled the comprehension. The skater\r\non smooth ice, the ship riding at sea, or even the fish floating in\r\nwater, offers only an incomplete analogy; for the fish has approximately\r\nthe same weight as the water it displaces, while a turkey buzzard of two\r\nor three pounds' weight will circle by the half-hour on motionless wing\r\nupheld only by the thin medium of the air.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, prior to his removal to Washington as Secretary of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, Langley began his experiments in aerodynamics\r\nat the old observatory in Allegheny--now a part of the city of\r\nPittsburgh. His chief apparatus was a whirling table, sixty feet in\r\ndiameter, and with an outside speed of seventy miles an hour. This was\r\nat first driven by a gas engine,--ironically named \"Automatic,\"--for\r\nwhich a steam engine was substituted in the following year. By means of\r\nthe whirling table and a resistance-gauge (dynamometer chronograph)\r\nLangley studied the effect of the air on planes of varying lengths and\r\nbreadths, set at varying angles, and borne horizontally at different\r\nvelocities. At times he substituted stuffed birds for the metal planes,\r\non the action of which under air pressure his scientific deductions were\r\nbased. In 1891 he published the results of his experiments. These\r\nproved--in opposition to the teaching of some very distinguished\r\nscientists--that the force required to sustain inclined planes in\r\nhorizontal locomotion through the air diminishes with increased velocity\r\n(at least within the limits of the experiment). Here a marked contrast\r\nis shown between aerial locomotion on the one hand, and land and water\r\nlocomotion on the other; \"whereas in land or marine transport increased\r\nspeed is maintained only by a disproportionate expenditure of power,\r\nwithin the limits of experiment in such _aerial horizontal transport,\r\nthe higher speeds are more economical of power than the lower ones_.\"\r\nAgain, the experiments demonstrated that the force necessary to maintain\r\nat high velocity an apparatus consisting of planes and motors could be\r\nproduced by means already available. It was found, for example, that one\r\nhorse-power rightly applied is sufficient to maintain a plane of two\r\nhundred pounds in horizontal flight at a rate of about forty-five miles\r\nan hour. Langley had in fact furnished experimental proof that the\r\naerial locomotion of bodies many times heavier than air was possible. He\r\nreserved for further experimentation the question of aerodromics, the\r\nform, ascent, maintenance in horizontal position, and descent of an\r\naerodrome (ἀεροδρόμος, traversing the air), as he called the prospective\r\nflying machine. He believed, however, that the time had come for\r\nseriously considering these things, and intelligent physicists, who\r\nbefore the publication of Langley's experiments had regarded all plans\r\nof aerial navigation as utopian, soon came to share his belief.\r\nAccording to Octave Chanute there was in Europe in 1889 utter\r\ndisagreement and confusion in reference to fundamental questions of\r\naerodynamics. He thought Langley had given firm ground to stand upon\r\nconcerning air resistances and reactions, and that the beginning of the\r\nsolution of the problem of aerial navigation would date from the\r\nAmerican scientist's experiments in aerodynamics.\r\n\r\nVery early in his investigations Langley thought he received through\r\nwatching the anemometer a clue to the mystery of flight. Observations,\r\nbegun at Pittsburgh in 1887 and continued at Washington in 1893,\r\nconvinced him that the course of the wind is \"a series of complex and\r\nlittle-known phenomena,\" and that a wind to which we may assign a mean\r\nvelocity of twenty or thirty miles an hour, even disregarding the\r\nquestion of strata and currents, is far from being a mere mass movement,\r\nand consists of pulsations varying both in rate and direction from\r\nsecond to second. If this complexity is revealed by the stationary\r\nanemometer--which may register a momentary calm in the midst of a\r\ngale--how great a diversity of pressure must exist in a large extent of\r\natmosphere. This _internal work of the wind_ will lift the soaring bird\r\nat times to higher levels, from which without special movement of the\r\nwings it may descend in the very face of the wind's general course.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, however, of his experiments Langley had sought to\r\ndevise a successful flying machine. In 1887 and the following years he\r\nconstructed about forty rubber-driven models, all of which were\r\nsubmitted to trial and modification. From these tests he felt that he\r\nlearned much about the conditions of flight in free air which could not\r\nbe learned from the more definitely controlled tests with simple planes\r\non the whirling table. His essential object was, of course, to reduce\r\nthe principles of equilibrium to practice. Besides different forms and\r\nsizes he tried various materials of construction, and ultimately various\r\nmeans of propulsion. Before he could test his larger steam-driven\r\nmodels, made for the most part of steel and weighing about one thousand\r\ntimes as much as the air displaced, Langley spent many months contriving\r\nand constructing suitable launching apparatus. The solution of the\r\nproblem of safe descent after flight he in a sense postponed, conducting\r\nhis experiments from a house-boat on the Potomac, where the model might\r\ncome down without serious damage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL HEAVIER-THAN-AIR FLYING MACHINE\r\n\r\nA photograph taken at the moment of launching Langley's aerodrome May 6,\r\n1896]\r\n\r\nIt was on May 6, 1896 (the anniversary of which date is now celebrated\r\nas Langley Day), that the success was achieved which all who witnessed\r\nit considered decisive of the future of mechanical flight. The whole\r\napparatus--steel frame, miniature steam engine, smoke stack,\r\ncondensed-air chamber, gasoline tank, wooden propellers, wings--weighed\r\nabout twenty-four pounds. There was developed a steam pressure of about\r\n115 pounds, and the actual power was nearly one horse-power. At a given\r\nsignal the aeroplane was released from the overhead launching apparatus\r\non the upper deck of the house-boat. It rose steadily to an ultimate\r\nheight of from seventy to a hundred feet. It circled (owing to the guys\r\nof one wing being loose) to the right, completing two circles and\r\nbeginning a third as it advanced; so that the whole course had the form\r\nof a spiral. At the end of one minute and twenty seconds the propellers\r\nbegan to slow down owing to the exhaustion of fuel. The aeroplane\r\ndescended slowly and gracefully, appearing to settle on the water. It\r\nseemed to Alexander Graham Bell that no one could witness this\r\ninteresting spectacle, of a flying machine in perfect equilibrium,\r\nwithout being convinced that the possibility of aerial flight by\r\nmechanical means had been demonstrated. On the very day of the test he\r\nwrote to the Académie des Sciences that there had never before been\r\nconstructed, so far as he knew, a heavier-than-air flying machine, or\r\naerodrome, which could by its own power maintain itself in the air for\r\nmore than a few seconds.\r\n\r\nLangley felt that he had now completed the work in this field which\r\nproperly belonged to him as a scientist--\"the demonstration of the\r\npracticability of mechanical flight\"--and that the public might look to\r\nothers for its development and commercial exploitation. Like Franklin\r\nand Davy he declined to take out patents, or in any way to make money\r\nfrom scientific discovery; and like Henry, the first Secretary of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution (to whom the early development of\r\nelectro-magnetic machines was due), he preferred to be known as a\r\nscientist rather than as an inventor.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Langley's desire to construct a large, man-carrying\r\naeroplane ultimately became irresistible. Just before the outbreak of\r\nthe Spanish War in 1898 he felt that such a machine might be of service\r\nto his country in the event of hostilities that seemed to him imminent.\r\nThe attention of President McKinley was called to the matter, and a\r\njoint commission of Army and Navy officers was appointed to make\r\ninvestigation of the results of Professor Langley's experiments in\r\naerial navigation. A favorable report having been made by that body, the\r\nBoard of Ordnance and Fortification recommended a grant of fifty\r\nthousand dollars to defray the expenses of further research. Langley was\r\nrequested to undertake the construction of a machine which might lead to\r\nthe development of an engine of war, and in December, 1898, he formally\r\nagreed to go on with the work.\r\n\r\nHe hoped at first to obtain from manufacturers a gasoline engine\r\nsufficiently light and sufficiently powerful for a man-carrying machine.\r\nAfter several disappointments, the automobile industry being then in its\r\ninfancy, he succeeded in constructing a five-cylinder gasoline motor of\r\nfifty-two horse-power and weighing only about a hundred and twenty\r\npounds. He also constructed new launching apparatus. After tests with\r\nsuperposed sustaining surfaces, he adhered to the \"single-tier plan.\"\r\nThere is interesting evidence that in 1900 Langley renewed his study of\r\nthe flight of soaring birds, the area of their extended wing surface in\r\nrelation to weight, and the vertical distance between the center of\r\npressure and the center of gravity in gulls and different species of\r\nbuzzards. He noted among other things that the tilting of a wing was\r\nsufficient to bring about a complete change of direction.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 1903 two new machines were ready for field trials,\r\nwhich were undertaken from a large house-boat, especially constructed\r\nfor the purpose and then moored in the mid-stream of the Potomac about\r\nforty miles below Washington. The larger of these two machines weighed\r\nseven hundred and five pounds and was designed to carry an engineer to\r\ncontrol the motor and direct the flight. The motive power was supplied\r\nby the light and powerful gasoline engine already referred to. The\r\nsmaller aeroplane was a quarter-size model of the larger one. It weighed\r\nfifty-eight pounds, had an engine of between two and a half and three\r\nhorse-power, and a sustaining surface of sixty-six square feet.\r\n\r\nThis smaller machine was tested August 8, 1903, the same launching\r\napparatus being employed as with the steam-driven models of 1896. In\r\nspite of the fact that one of the mechanics failed to withdraw a certain\r\npin at the moment of launching, and that some breakage of the apparatus\r\nconsequently occurred, the aeroplane made a good start, and fulfilled\r\nthe main purpose of the test by maintaining a perfect equilibrium. After\r\nmoving about three hundred and fifty feet in a straight course it\r\nwheeled a quarter-circle to the right, at the same time descending\r\nslightly, the engine slowing down. Then it began to rise, moving\r\nstraight ahead again for three or four hundred feet, the propellers\r\npicking up their former rate. Once more the engine slackened, but,\r\nbefore the aeroplane reached the water, seemed to regain its normal\r\nspeed. For a third time the engine slowed down, and, before it\r\nrecovered, the aeroplane had touched the water. It had traversed a\r\ndistance of one thousand feet in twenty-seven seconds. One of the\r\nworkmen confessed that he had poured into the tank too much gasoline.\r\nThis had caused an overflow into the intake pipe, which in turn\r\ninterfered with the action of a valve.\r\n\r\nThe larger aeroplane with the engineer Manly on board was first tested\r\non October 7 of the same year, but the front guy post caught in the\r\nlaunching car and the machine plunged into the water a few feet from the\r\nhouse-boat. In spite of this discouraging mishap the engineers and\r\nothers present felt confidence in the aeroplane's power to fly. What\r\nwould to-day be regarded by an aeronaut as a slight setback seemed at\r\nthat moment like a tragic failure. The fifty thousand dollars had been\r\nexhausted nearly two years previously; Professor Langley had made as\r\nfull use as seemed to him advisable of the resources put at his disposal\r\nby the Smithsonian Institution; the young men of the press, for whom the\r\nsupposed aberration of a great scientist furnished excellent copy, were\r\nvirulent in their criticisms. Manly made one more heroic attempt under\r\nvery unfavorable conditions at the close of a winter's day (December 8,\r\n1903). Again difficulty occurred with the launching gear, the rear wings\r\nand rudder being wrecked before the aeroplane was clear of the ways.\r\nThe experiments were now definitely abandoned, and the inventor was\r\noverwhelmed by the sense of failure, and still more by the skepticism\r\nwith which the public had regarded his endeavors.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 an account of Langley's aeroplane appeared in the Bulletin of\r\nthe Italian Aeronautical Society. Two years later this same publication\r\nin an article on a new Blériot aeroplane said: \"The Blériot IV in the\r\nform of a bird ... does not appear to give good results, perhaps on\r\naccount of the lack of stability, and Blériot, instead of trying some\r\nnew modification which might remedy such a grave fault, laid it aside\r\nand at once began the construction of a new type, No. V, adopting purely\r\nand simply the arrangement of the American, Langley, which offers a good\r\nstability.\" In the summer of 1907 Blériot obtained striking results with\r\nthis machine, the launching problem having been solved in the previous\r\nyear--the year of Langley's death--by the use of wheels which permitted\r\nthe aeroplane to get under way by running along the ground under its own\r\ndriving power. The early flights with No. V were made at a few feet from\r\nthe ground, and the clever French aviator could affect the direction of\r\nthe machine by slightly shifting his position, and even had skill to\r\nbring it down by simply leaning forward. By the use of the steering\r\napparatus he circled to the right or to the left with the grace of a\r\nbird on the wing. When, on July 25, 1909, Blériot crossed the English\r\nChannel in his monoplane, all the world knew that man's conquest of the\r\nair was a _fait accompli_.\r\n\r\nAbout three years after Langley's death the Board of Regents of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution established the Langley Medal for investigations\r\nin aerodromics in its application to aviation. The first award went\r\n(1909) to Wilbur and Orville Wright, the second (1913) to Mr. Glenn H.\r\nCurtiss and M. Gustave Eiffel. On the occasion of the presentation of\r\nthe medals of the second award--May 6, 1913--the Langley Memorial\r\nTablet, erected in the main vestibule of the Smithsonian building, was\r\nunveiled by the scientist's old friend, Dr. John A. Brashear. In the\r\nwords of the present Secretary of the Institution, the tablet represents\r\nMr. Langley seated on a terrace where he has a clear view of the\r\nheavens, and, in a meditative mood, is observing the flight of birds,\r\nwhile in his mind he sees his aerodrome soaring above them.\r\n\r\nThe lettering of the tablet is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY\r\n    1834-1906\r\n\r\n    SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION\r\n    1887-1906\r\n\r\n    DISCOVERED THE RELATIONS OF SPEED\r\n    AND ANGLE OF INCLINATION TO THE\r\n    LIFTING POWER OF SURFACES WHEN\r\n    MOVING IN AIR\r\n\r\n     \"I have brought to a close the portion of the work which seemed to\r\n     be especially mine, the demonstration of the practicability of\r\n     mechanical flight.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The great universal highway overhead is now soon to be\r\n     opened.\"--Langley, 1897.\r\n\r\nA still more fitting tribute to the memory of the great inventor came\r\ntwo years later from a successful aviator. In the spring of 1914 Mr.\r\nGlenn H. Curtiss was invited to send apparatus to Washington for the\r\nLangley Day Celebration. He expressed the desire to put the Langley\r\naeroplane itself in the air. The machine was taken to the Curtiss\r\nAviation Field at Keuka Lake, New York. Langley's method of launching\r\nhad been proved practical, but Curtiss finally decided to start from the\r\nwater, and accordingly fitted the aeroplane with hydroaeroplane floats.\r\nIn spite of the great increase in weight involved by this addition, the\r\nLangley aeroplane, under its own power plant, skimmed over the wavelets,\r\nrose from the lake, and soared gracefully in the air, maintaining its\r\nequilibrium, on May 28, 1914, over eight years after the death of its\r\ndesigner. When furnished with an eighty horse-power motor, more suited\r\nto its increased weight, the aerodrome planed easily over the water in\r\nmore prolonged flight. In the periodical publications of June, 1914, may\r\nbe read the eloquent announcement: \"Langley's Folly Flies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Alexander Graham Bell, Experiments in Mechanical Flight, _Nature_, May\r\n   28, 1896.\r\n\r\n Alexander Graham Bell, The Pioneer Aerial Flight, _Scientific\r\n   American_, Supplement, Feb. 26, 1910.\r\n\r\n S.

It longs for certainty and repose, and has\r\nlittle patience for any authority that does not claim absolute\r\ninfallibility. Many a man of the world is bewildered to find Newton's\r\ndisciples building upon or refuting the teachings of the master, or to\r\nlearn that Darwin's doctrine is itself subject to the universal law of\r\nchange and development. Though in ethics and religion the older order\r\nchanges yielding place to new, and the dispensation of an eye for an eye\r\nand a tooth for a tooth finds its fulfilment and culmination in a\r\ndispensation of forbearance and non-resistance of evil, still many look\r\nupon the overthrow of any scientific theory not as a sign of vitality\r\nand advance, but as a symptom of the early dissolution or at least of\r\nthe bankruptcy of science. It is not surprising, therefore, that the\r\npublic regard the scientific hypothesis with a kind of contempt; for a\r\nhypothesis (ὑπόθεσις, foundation, supposition) is necessarily ephemeral.\r\nWhen disproved, it is shown to have been a false supposition; when\r\nproved, it is no longer hypothetic.\r\n\r\nYet a page from the history of science should indicate that hypotheses\r\nplay a rôle in experimental science and lead to results that no devotee\r\nof facts and scorner of mere theory can well ignore.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Sir William Ramsay, who in the previous year had discovered an\r\ninert gas, argon, in the atmosphere, identified a second inert gas\r\n(obtained from minerals containing uranium and thorium) as helium\r\n(ἥλιος, sun), an element previously revealed by spectrum analysis as a\r\nconstituent of the sun. In the same year Röntgen, while experimenting\r\nwith the rays that stream from the cathode in a vacuum tube, discovered\r\nnew rays (which he called X-rays) possessed of wonderful photographic\r\npower. At the beginning of 1896 Henri Becquerel, experimenting on the\r\nsupposition, or hypothesis, that the emission of rays was associated\r\nwith phosphorescence, tested the photographic effects of a number of\r\nphosphorescent substances. He exposed, among other compounds, crystals\r\nof the double sulphate of uranium and potassium to sunlight and then\r\nplaced upon the crystals a photographic plate wrapped in two thicknesses\r\nof heavy black paper. The outline of the phosphorescent substance was\r\ndeveloped on the plate. An image of a coin was obtained by placing it\r\nbetween uranic salts and a photographic plate. Two or three days after\r\nreporting this result Becquerel chanced (the sunlight at the time\r\nseeming to him too intermittent for experimentation) to put away in the\r\nsame drawer, and in juxtaposition, a photographic plate and these\r\nphosphorescent salts. To his surprise he obtained a clear image when the\r\nplate was developed. He now assumed the existence of invisible rays\r\nsimilar to X-rays. They proved capable of passing through sheets of\r\naluminum and of copper, and of discharging electrified bodies. Days\r\nelapsed without any apparent diminution of the radiation. On the\r\nsupposition that the rays might resemble light he tried to refract,\r\nreflect, and polarize them; but this hypothesis was by the experiments\r\nof Rutherford, and of Becquerel himself, ultimately overthrown. In the\r\nmean time the French scientist obtained radiations from metallic uranium\r\nand from uranous salts. These, in contrast with the uranic salts, are\r\nnon-phosphorescent. Becquerel's original hypothesis was thus overthrown.\r\nRadiation is a property inherent in uranium and independent both of\r\nlight and of phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nOn April 13 and April 23 (1898) respectively Mme. Sklodowska Curie and\r\nG. C. Schmidt published the results of their studies of the radiations\r\nof the salts of thorium. Each of these studies was based on the work of\r\nBecquerel. Mme. Curie examined at the same time the salts of uranium and\r\na number of uranium ores. Among the latter she made use of the composite\r\nmineral pitchblende from the mines of Joachimsthal and elsewhere, and\r\nfound that the radiations from the natural ores are more active than\r\nthose from pure uranium. This discovery naturally led to further\r\ninvestigation, on the assumption that pitchblende contains more than one\r\nradioactive substance. Polonium, named by Mme. Curie in honor of her\r\nnative country, was the third radioactive element to be discovered. In\r\nthe chemical analysis of pitchblende made by Mme. Curie (assisted by M.\r\nCurie) polonium was found associated with bismuth. Radium, also\r\ndiscovered in this analysis of 1898, was associated with barium. Mme.\r\nCurie succeeded in obtaining the pure chloride of radium and in\r\ndetermining the atomic weight of the new element. There is (according to\r\nSoddy) about one part of radium in five million parts of the best\r\npitchblende, but the new element is about one million times more\r\nradioactive than uranium. It was calculated by M. Curie that the energy\r\nof one gram of radium would suffice to lift a weight of five hundred\r\ntons to a height of one mile. After discussing the bearing of the\r\ndiscovery of radioactivity on the threatened exhaustion of the coal\r\nsupply Soddy writes enthusiastically: \"But the recognition of the\r\nboundless and inexhaustible energy of Nature (and the intellectual\r\ngratification it affords) brightens the whole outlook of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\" The element yields spontaneously radium emanation without any\r\napparent diminution of its own mass. In 1899 Debierne discovered, also\r\nin the highly complex pitchblende, actinium, which has proved\r\nconsiderably less radioactive than radium. During these investigations\r\nM. and Mme. Curie, M. Becquerel, and those associated with them were\r\ninfluenced by the hypothesis that radioactivity is an _atomic property_\r\nof radioactive substances. This hypothesis came to definite expression\r\nin 1899 and again in 1902 through Mme. Curie.\r\n\r\nIn the latter year the physicist E. Rutherford and the chemist F. Soddy,\r\nwhile investigating the radioactivity of thorium in the laboratories of\r\nMcGill University, Montreal, were forced to recognize that thorium\r\ncontinuously gives rise to new kinds of radioactive matter differing\r\nfrom itself in chemical properties, in stability, and in radiant energy.\r\nThey concurred in the view held by all the most prominent workers in\r\nthis subject, namely, that radioactivity is an atomic phenomenon. It is\r\nnot molecular decomposition. They declared that the radioactive\r\nsubstances must be undergoing a spontaneous transformation. The daring\r\nnature of this hypothesis and its likelihood to revolutionize physical\r\nscience is brought home to one by recalling that three decades\r\npreviously an eminent physicist had said that \"though in the course of\r\nages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in the heavens, though\r\nancient systems may be dissolved and new systems evolved out of their\r\nruins, the molecules [atoms] out of which these systems are built--the\r\nfoundation stones of the material universe--remain unbroken and unworn.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1903 Rutherford and Soddy stated definitely their hypothesis,\r\ngenerally known as the \"Transformation Theory,\" that the atoms of\r\nradioactive substances suffer spontaneous disintegration, a process\r\nunaffected by great changes of temperature (or by physical or chemical\r\nchanges of any kind at the disposal of the experimenter) and giving rise\r\nto new radioactive substances differing in chemical (and physical)\r\nproperties from the parent elements. The radiations consist of α\r\nparticles (atoms of helium minus two negative electrons), β particles,\r\nor electrons (charges of negative electricity), and γ rays, of the\r\nnature of Röntgen rays and light but of very much shorter wave length\r\nand of very great penetrating power. It is by the energy inherent in the\r\natom of the radioactive substance that the radiations are ejected,\r\nsometimes, in the case of the γ rays, with velocity sufficient to\r\npenetrate two feet of lead. It is through these radiations that\r\nspontaneous transformation takes place. After ten years of further\r\ninvestigation Rutherford stated that this hypothesis affords a\r\nsatisfactory explanation of all radioactive phenomena, and gives unity\r\nto what without it would seem disconnected facts. Besides accounting for\r\nold experimental results it suggests new lines of work and even enables\r\none to predict the outcome of further investigation. It does not really\r\ncontradict, as some thought might be the case, the principle of the\r\nconservation of energy. The atom, to be sure, can no longer be\r\nconsidered the smallest unit of matter, as the mass of a β particle is\r\napproximately one seventeen-hundredths that of an atom of hydrogen.\r\nStill the new hypothesis is a modification and not a contradiction of\r\nthe atomic theory.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that the series of radioactive substances is due, not to\r\nsuch molecular changes as chemistry had made familiar, but to a\r\nbreakdown of the atom seemed to Rutherford in 1913 at least justified by\r\nthe results of the investigators whose procedure had been dictated by\r\nthat hypothesis. He set forth in tables these results (since somewhat\r\nmodified), indicating after the name of each radioactive substance the\r\nnature of the radiation through the emission of which the element is\r\ntransformed into the next-succeeding member of its series.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Radioactive Substances_\r\n\r\n URANIUM            α particles\r\n Uranium X          β + γ\r\n Uranium Y          β\r\n IONIUM             α\r\n\r\n RADIUM             α + slow β\r\n Emanation          α\r\n Radium A           α\r\n Radium B           β + γ\r\n Radium C { C{1}    α + β + γ\r\n          { C{2}    β\r\n RADIUM D           }\r\n RADIO-LEAD         } slow β\r\n Radium E           β + γ\r\n Radium F           }\r\n Polonium           } α\r\n\r\n THORIUM            α\r\n MESOTHORIUM 1      no rays\r\n Mesothorium 2      β + γ\r\n RADIOTHORIUM       α\r\n Thorium X          α + β\r\n Emanation          α\r\n Thorium A          α\r\n Thorium B          slow β\r\n Thorium C { C{1}   α\r\n           { C{2}   α\r\n Thorium D          β + γ\r\n\r\n ACTINIUM           no rays\r\n Radio-actinium     α + β\r\n Actinium X         α\r\n Emanation          α\r\n Actinium A         α\r\n Actinium B         slow β\r\n Actinium C         α\r\n Actinium D         α + γ\r\n\r\nEven a glance at this long list of new elements reveals certain\r\nanalogies between one series of transformations and another. Each series\r\ncontains an emanation, or gas, which through the loss of α particles is\r\ntransformed into the next following member of the series. Continuing the\r\ncomparison in either direction, up or down the lists, one could readily\r\ndetect other analogies.\r\n\r\nThere is some ground for thinking that lead is the end product of the\r\nUranium series. To reverse the process of the transformation and produce\r\nradium from the base metal lead would be an achievement greater than the\r\nvaunted transmutations of the alchemists. Although that seems beyond the\r\nreach of possibility, the idea has stirred the imagination of more than\r\none scientist. \"The philosopher's stone,\" writes Soddy, \"was accredited\r\nthe power not only of transmuting the metals, but of acting _as the\r\nelixir of life_. Now, whatever the origin of this apparently meaningless\r\njumble of ideas may have been, it is really a perfect and but very\r\nslightly allegorical expression of the actual present views we hold\r\nto-day.\" Again, it is conjectured that bismuth is the end-product of the\r\nthorium series. The presence of the results of atomic disintegration\r\n(like lead and helium) has proved of interest to geology and other\r\nsciences as affording a clue to the age of the rocks in which they are\r\nfound deposited.\r\n\r\nBefore Rutherford, Mme. Curie, and others especially interested in\r\nradioactive substances, assumed that atoms are far different from the\r\nmassy, hard, impenetrable particles that Newton took for granted, Sir J.\r\nJ. Thomson and his school were studying the constitution of the atom\r\nfrom another standpoint but with somewhat similar results. This great\r\nphysicist had proved that cathode rays are composed not of negatively\r\ncharged molecules, as had been supposed, but of much smaller particles\r\nor corpuscles. Wherever, as in the vacuum tube, these electrons appear,\r\nthe presence of positively charged particles can also be demonstrated.\r\nIt is manifest that the atom, instead of being the ultimate unit of\r\nmatter, is a system of positively and negatively charged particles.\r\nRutherford in the main concurred in this view, though differing from Sir\r\nJ. J. Thomson as to the arrangement of corpuscles within the atom. Let\r\nit suffice here to state that Rutherford assumes that the greater mass\r\nof the atom consists of negatively charged particles rotating about a\r\npositive nucleus. The surrounding electrons render the atom electrically\r\nneutral.\r\n\r\nThis corpuscular theory of matter may throw light on the laws of\r\nchemical combination. The so-called chemical affinity between two atoms\r\nof such and such valencies, which Davy and others since his time had\r\nregarded as essentially an electrical phenomenon, seems now to admit of\r\nmore definite interpretation. Each atom is negatively or positively\r\ncharged according to the addition or subtraction of electrons. Chemical\r\ncomposition takes place between atoms the charges of which are of\r\nopposite sign, and valency depends on the number of unit charges of\r\nelectricity. Moreover, the electrical theory of matter lends support to\r\nthe hypothesis that there is a fundamental unitary element underlying\r\nall the so-called elements. The fact that elements fall into groups and\r\nthat their chemical properties vary with their atomic weights long ago\r\nsuggested this assumption of a primitive matter, _protyl_, from which\r\nall other substances were derived. In the light of the corpuscular\r\ntheory as well as of the transformation theory it seems possible that\r\nthe helium atom and the negative corpuscle will offer a clue to the\r\ngenesis of the elements.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be learned from this rapid sketch, of the discovery of the\r\nradioactive substances, concerning the nature and value of scientific\r\nhypothesis? For one thing, the scientific hypothesis is necessary to the\r\nexperimenter. The mind runs ahead of and guides the experiment. Again,\r\nthe hypothesis suggests new lines of research, enables one in some cases\r\nto anticipate the outcome of experiment, and may be abundantly justified\r\nby results. \"It is safe to say,\" writes Rutherford, \"that the rapidity\r\nof growth of accurate knowledge of radioactive phenomena has been\r\nlargely due to the influence of the disintegration theory.\" The valid\r\nhypothesis serves to explain facts, leads to discovery, and does not\r\nconflict with known facts or with verified generalizations, though, as\r\nwe have seen, it may modify other hypotheses. Those who support a\r\nhypothesis should bring it to the test of rigid verification, avoiding\r\nskepticism, shunning credulity. Even a false assumption, as we have\r\nseen, may prove valuable when carefully put to the proof.\r\n\r\nThe layman's distrust of the unverified hypothesis is in the main\r\nwholesome. It is a duty not to believe it, not to disbelieve it, but to\r\nweigh judicially the evidence for and against. The fact that assumption\r\nplays a large part in our mental attitude toward practical affairs\r\nshould make us wary of contesting the legitimacy of scientific\r\nhypotheses.\r\n\r\nNo one would deny the right of forming a provisional assumption to the\r\nintelligence officer interpreting a cipher, or to the detective\r\nunravelling the mystery of a crime. The first assumes that the message\r\nis in a certain language, and, perhaps, that each symbol employed is the\r\nequivalent of a letter, his assumption is put to the proof of getting a\r\nreasonable and consistent meaning from the cipher. The detective assumes\r\na motive for the crime, or the employment of certain means of escape;\r\neven if his assumption does not clear up the mystery, it may have value\r\nas leading to a new and more adequate assumption.\r\n\r\nHenri Poincaré has pointed out that one of the most dangerous forms of\r\nhypothesis is the unconscious hypothesis. It is difficult to prove or\r\ndisprove because it does not come to clear statement. The alleged\r\ndevotee of facts and of things as they are, in opposing the assumptions\r\nof an up-to-date science, is often, unknown to himself, standing on a\r\nplatform of outworn theory, or of mere vulgar assumption. For example,\r\nwhen Napoleon was trying to destroy the commercial wealth of England at\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, he unconsciously based his\r\nprocedure on an antiquated doctrine of political economy. For him the\r\nteachings of Adam Smith and Turgot were idle sophistries. \"I seek,\" he\r\nsaid to his Minister of Finance, \"the good that is practical, not the\r\nideal best: the world is very old, we must profit by its experience; it\r\nteaches that old practices are worth more than new theories: you are not\r\nthe only one who knows trade secrets.\" We are not here especially\r\nconcerned with the question of whether Napoleon was or was not pursuing\r\nthe best means of breaking down English credit. He did try to prevent\r\nthe English from exchanging exports for European gold, while permitting\r\nimports in the hope of depleting England of gold. But in pursuing this\r\npolicy he thought he was proceeding on the ground of immemorial\r\npractice, while he was merely pitting the seventeenth-century doctrine\r\nof Locke against the doctrine of Adam Smith which had superseded it.\r\n\r\nAccording to one scientific hypothesis, \"Species originated by means of\r\nnatural selection, or, through the preservation of favored races in the\r\nstruggle for life.\" This assumption was rightly subjected to close\r\nscrutiny in 1859 and the years following. The ephemeral nature of the\r\nvast majority of hypotheses and the danger to progress of accepting an\r\nunverified assumption justify the demand for demonstrative evidence. The\r\ntestimony having been examined, it is our privilege to state and to\r\nsupport the opposing hypothesis. It was thus that the hypothesis that\r\nthe planets move in circular orbits, recommended by its simplicity and\r\næsthetic quality, was forced to give way to the hypothesis of elliptical\r\norbits. Newton's hypothesis that light is due to particles emitted by\r\nall luminous bodies yielded, at least for the time, to the theory of\r\nlight vibrations in an ether pervading all space. The path of scientific\r\nprogress is strewn with the ruins of overthrown hypotheses. Many of the\r\ndefeated assumptions have been merely implicit errors of the man in the\r\nstreet, and they are overthrown not by facts alone, but by new\r\nhypotheses verified by facts and leading to fresh discoveries.\r\n\r\nAccording to John Stuart Mill, \"It appears ... to be a condition of a\r\ngenuinely scientific hypothesis, that it be not destined always to\r\nremain an hypothesis, but be of such a nature as to be either proved or\r\ndisproved by that comparison with observed facts which is termed\r\nVerification.\" This statement is of value in confirming the general\r\ndistrust of _mere_ hypothesis, and in distinguishing between the\r\nunverified and unverifiable presupposition and the legitimate assumption\r\nwhich through verification may become established doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n J.

Any attempt to catalogue the names of those who have approached\r\nthe study of the mind from the direction of the natural sciences is\r\nliable to prove unsatisfactory, and a brief list is sure to entail many\r\nimportant omissions. The mention of Locke, Cheselden, Hartley, Cabanis,\r\nYoung, Weber, Gall, Müller, Du Bois-Reymond, Bell, Magendie, Helmholtz,\r\nDarwin, Lotze, Ferrier, Goltz, Munk, Mosso, Maudsley, Carpenter, Galton,\r\nHering, Clouston, James, Janet, Kraepelin, Flechsig, and Wundt will,\r\nhowever, serve to remind us of the richness of the contribution of the\r\nnatural sciences to the so-called mental science. Indeed, physiology\r\nwould be incomplete unless it took account of the functions of the sense\r\norgans, of the sensory and motor nerves, of the brain with its\r\nassociation areas, as well as the expression of the emotions, and the\r\nchanges of function accompanying the development of the nervous system,\r\nfrom the formation of the embryo till physical dissolution, and from\r\nspecies of the simplest to those of the most complex organization.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the French physician Cabanis\r\nwas disposed to identify human personality with mere nervous\r\norganization reacting to physical impressions, and to look upon the\r\nbrain as the organ for the production of mind. He soon, however,\r\nwithdrew from this extreme position and expressed his conviction of the\r\nexistence of an immortal spirit apart from the body. One might say that\r\nthe brain is the instrument through which the mind manifests itself\r\nrather than the organ by which mind is excreted. Even so, it must be\r\nagreed that the relation between the psychic agent and the physical\r\ninstrument is so close that physiology must take heed of mental\r\nphenomena and that psychology must not ignore the physical concomitants\r\nof mental processes. Hence arises a new branch of natural science,\r\nphysiological psychology, or, as Fechner (1860), the disciple of Weber,\r\ncalled it, psycho-physics.\r\n\r\nThrough this alliance between the study of the mind and the study of\r\nbodily functions the intelligence of the lower animals and its survival\r\nvalue, the mental growth of the child, mental deterioration in age and\r\ndisease, and the psychological endowments of special classes or of\r\nindividuals, became subjects for investigation. Now human psychology is\r\nrecognized as contributing to various branches of anthropology, or the\r\ngeneral study of man.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Wundt, who, as already implied, had approached the study of the\r\nmind from the side of the natural sciences, established in 1875 at the\r\nUniversity of Leipzig the first psycho-physical institute for the\r\nexperimental study of mental phenomena. His express purpose was to\r\nanalyze the content of consciousness into its elements, to examine these\r\nelements in their qualitative and quantitative differences, and to\r\ndetermine with precision the conditions of their existence and\r\nsuccession. Thus science after contemplating a wide range of outer\r\nphenomena--plants, animals, earth's crust, heavenly bodies, molecules\r\nand atoms--turns its attention with keen scrutiny inward on the thinking\r\nmind, the subjective process by which man becomes cognizant of all\r\nobjective things.\r\n\r\nThe need of expert study of the human mind as the instrument of\r\nscientific discovery might have been inferred from the fact that the\r\nphysicist Tyndall read before the British Association in 1870 a paper on\r\nthe Scientific Use of the Imagination, in which he spoke of the\r\nimagination as the architect of physical theory, cited Newton, Dalton,\r\nDavy, and Faraday as affording examples of the just use of this creative\r\npower of the mind, and quoted a distinguished chemist as identifying the\r\nmental process of scientific discovery with that of artistic production.\r\nTyndall even chased the psychologists in their own field and stated that\r\nit was only by the exercise of the imagination that we could ascribe the\r\npossession of mental powers to our fellow creatures. \"You believe that\r\nin society you are surrounded by reasonable beings like yourself....\r\nWhat is your warrant for this conviction? Simply and solely this: your\r\nfellow-creatures behave as if they were reasonable.\"\r\n\r\nOn the traces of this brilliant incursion of the natural philosopher\r\ninto the realm of mental science, later psychologists must follow but\r\nhaltingly. Just as in the history of physics a long series of studies\r\nintervened between Bacon's hypothesis that heat is a kind of motion\r\n(1620) and Tyndall's own work, _Heat as a Mode of Motion_ (1863), so\r\nmust many psychological investigations be made before an adequate\r\npsychology of scientific discovery can be formulated. It may ultimately\r\nprove that the passages in which Tyndall and other scientists speak of\r\nscientific _imagination_ would read as well if for this term, intuition,\r\ninspiration, unconscious cerebration, or even reason were substituted.\r\n\r\nAt first glance it would seem that the study of the sensory elements of\r\nconsciousness, motor, tactile, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory,\r\nthermal, internal, pursued for the last half century by the experimental\r\nmethod, would furnish a clue to the nature of the imagination. A visual\r\nimage, or mental picture, is popularly taken as characteristic of the\r\nimaginative process. In fact, the distinguished psychologist William\r\nJames devotes the whole of his interesting chapter on the imagination to\r\nthe discussion of different types of imagery. The sensory elements of\r\nconsciousness are involved, however, in perception, memory, volition,\r\nreason, and sentiment, as they are in imagination. They have been\r\nrecognized as fundamental from antiquity. Nothing is in the intellect\r\nwhich was not previously in the senses. To be out of one's senses is to\r\nlack the purposive guidance of the intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of individuals and groups shows startling differences in\r\nthe kind and vividness of imagery. Many cases are on record where the\r\nmental life is almost exclusively in visual, in auditory, or in motor\r\nterms. One student learns a foreign language by writing out every word\r\nand sentence; another is wholly dependent on hearing them spoken; a\r\nthird can recall the printed page with an almost photographic\r\nvividness. The history of literature and art furnishes us with\r\nillustrations of remarkable powers of visualization. Blake and Fromentin\r\nwere able to reproduce in pictures scenes long retained in memory. The\r\nlatter recognized that his painting was not an exact reproduction of\r\nwhat he had seen, but that it was none the less artistic because of the\r\nselective influence that his mind had exerted on the memory image.\r\nWordsworth at times postponed the description of a scene that appealed\r\nto his poetic fancy with the express purpose of blurring the outlines,\r\nbut enhancing the personal factor. Goethe had the power to call up at\r\nwill the form of a flower, to make it change from one color to another\r\nand to unfold before his mind's eye. Professor Dilthey has collected\r\nmany other records of the hallucinatory clearness of the visual imagery\r\nof literary artists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Galton, after his classical study of mental imagery\r\n(1883), stated that scientific men, as a class, have feeble powers of\r\nvisual representation. He had appealed for evidence of visual recall to\r\ndistinguished scientists because he thought them more capable than\r\nothers of accurately stating the results of their introspection. He had\r\nrecourse not only to English but to foreign scientists, including\r\nmembers of the French Institute. \"To my astonishment,\" he writes, \"I\r\nfound that the great majority of men of science to whom I first applied\r\nprotested that mental imagery was unknown to them, and they looked on me\r\nas fanciful and fantastic in supposing that the words 'mental imagery'\r\nreally expressed what I believed everybody supposed them to mean. They\r\nhad no more notion of its true nature than a color-blind man, who has\r\nnot discerned his defect, has of the nature of color.\" One scientist\r\nconfessed that it was only by a figure of speech that he could describe\r\nhis recollection of a scene as a mental image to be perceived with the\r\nmind's eye.\r\n\r\nWhen Galton questioned persons whom he met in general society he found\r\n\"an entirely different disposition to prevail. Many men and a yet larger\r\nnumber of women, and many boys and girls, declared that they habitually\r\nsaw mental imagery, and that it was perfectly distinct to them and full\r\nof color.\" The evidence of this difference between the psychology of the\r\naverage distinguished scientist and the average member of general\r\nsociety was greatly strengthened upon cross-examination. Galton\r\nattributed the difference to the scientist's \"habits of highly\r\ngeneralized and abstract thought, especially when the steps of reasoning\r\nare carried on by words [employed] as symbols.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only by the use of words as symbols that scientific thought is\r\npossible. It is through coöperation in work that mankind has imposed its\r\nwill upon the creation, and coöperation could not have been carried far\r\nwithout the development of language as a means of communication. Were it\r\nnot for the help of words we should be dependent, like the lower\r\nanimals, on the fleeting images of things. We should be bound to the\r\nworld of sense and not have range in the world of ideas. Words are a\r\nfree medium for thought, for the very reason that they are capable of\r\nshifting their meaning and taking on greater extension or intension. For\r\nexample, we may say that the apple falls because it is heavy, or we may\r\nsubstitute synonymous phraseology that helps us to view the falling\r\napple in its universal aspects. The mind acquires through language a\r\nfield of activity independent of the objective world. We have seen in an\r\nearlier chapter that geometry developed as a science is becoming\r\ngradually weaned from the art of surveying. Triangles and rectangles\r\ncease to suggest meadows, or vineyards, or any definite imagery of that\r\nsort, and are discussed in their abstract relationship. Science demands\r\nthe conceptual rather than the merely sensory. The invisible real world\r\nof atoms and corpuscles has its beginning in the reason, the word. To\r\nformulate new truths in the world of ideas is the prerogative of minds\r\ngifted with exceptional reason.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, language itself may be regarded as imagery. Some persons\r\nvisualize every word spoken as though it were seen on the printed page;\r\nothers cannot recall a literary passage without motor imagery of the\r\nspeech organs or even incipient speech; while others again experience\r\nmotor imagery of the writing hand. With many, in all forms of\r\nword-consciousness, the auditory image is predominant. In the sense of\r\nbeing accompanied by imagery all thinking is imaginative. But it is the\r\nuse of words that permits us to escape most completely from the more\r\nprimitive forms of intelligence. So directly does the printed word\r\nconvey its meaning to the trained mind that to regard it as so much\r\nblack on white rather than as a symbol is a rare and rather upsetting\r\nmental experience. Words differ among themselves in their power to\r\nsuggest images of the thing symbolized. The word \"existence\" is less\r\nimage-producing than \"flower,\" and \"flower\" than \"red rose.\" It is\r\ncharacteristic of the language of science to substitute the abstract or\r\ngeneral expression for the concrete and picturesque.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we are told that the imagination has been at the bottom\r\nof all great scientific discoveries, that the discovery of law is the\r\npeculiar function of the creative imagination, and that all great\r\nscientists have, in a certain sense, been great artists, we are\r\nconfronted with a paradox. In what department of thought is imagination\r\nmore strictly subordinated than in science? Genetic psychology attempts\r\nto trace the development of mind as a means of adjustment. It examines\r\nthe instincts that serve so wonderfully the survival of various species\r\nof insects. It studies the more easily modified instinct of birds, and\r\nnotes their ability to make intelligent choice on the basis of\r\nexperience. Does the bird's ability to recognize imply the possession of\r\nmemory, or imagery? Increased intelligence assures perpetuation of other\r\nspecies in novel and unforeseen conditions. The more tenacious the\r\nmemory, the richer the supply of images, the greater the powers of\r\nadaptation and survival. We know something concerning the motor memory\r\nof rodents and horses, and its biological value. The child inherits less\r\ndefinitely organized instincts, but greater plasticity, than the lower\r\nanimals. Its mental life is a chaos of images. It is the work of\r\neducation to discipline as well as to nourish the senses, to teach form\r\nas well as color, to impart the clarifying sense of number, weight, and\r\nmeasurement, to help distinguish between the dream and the reality, to\r\nteach language, the treasure-house of our traditional wisdom, and logic,\r\nso closely related to the right use of language. The facts of abnormal,\r\nas well as those of animal and child psychology, prove that the\r\nsubordination of the imagination and fancy to reason and understanding\r\nis an essential factor in intellectual development.\r\n\r\nNo one, of course, will claim that the mental activity of the scientific\r\ndiscoverer is wholly unlike that of any other class of man; but it leads\r\nonly to confusion to seek to identify processes so unlike as scientific\r\ngeneralization and artistic production. The artist's purpose is the\r\nconveyance of a mood. The author of _Macbeth_ employs every device to\r\nimpart to the auditor the sense of blood-guiltiness; every lurid scene,\r\nevery somber phrase, serves to enhance the sentiment. A certain picture\r\nby Dürer, a certain poem of Browning's, convey in every detail the\r\nfeeling of dauntless resolution. Again, a landscape painter, recognizing\r\nthat his satisfaction in a certain scene depends upon a stretch of blue\r\nwater with a yellow strand and old-gold foliage, proceeds to rearrange\r\nnature for the benefit of the mood he desires to enliven and perpetuate.\r\nIt is surely a far cry from the attitude of these artists manipulating\r\nimpressions in order to impart to others an individual mood, to that of\r\nthe scientific discoverer formulating a law valid for all intellects.\r\n\r\nIn the psychology of the present day there is much that is reminiscent\r\nof the biological psychology of Aristotle. From the primitive or\r\nnutrient soul which has to do with the vital functions of growth and\r\nreproduction, is developed the sentient soul, concerned with movement\r\nand sensibility. Finally emerges the intellectual and reasoning soul.\r\nThese three parts are not mutually exclusive, but the lower foreshadow\r\nthe higher and are subsumed in it. Aristotle, however, interpreted the\r\nlower by the higher and not vice versa. It is no compliment to the\r\nscientific discoverer to say that his loftiest intellectual achievement\r\nis closely akin to fiction, or is the result of a mere brooding on\r\nfacts, or is accompanied by emotional excitement, or is the work of\r\nblind instinct.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that scientific discovery, while predominantly an\r\nintellectual process, varies with the nature of the phenomena of the\r\ndifferent sciences and the individual mental differences of the\r\ndiscoverers. As stated at the outset the psychology of scientific\r\ndiscovery must be the subject of prolonged investigation, but some data\r\nare already available. One great mathematician, Poincaré, attributes his\r\ndiscoveries to intuition. The essential idea comes with a sense of\r\nillumination. It is characterized by suddenness, conciseness, and\r\nimmediate certainty. It may come unheralded, as he is crossing the\r\nstreet, walking on the cliffs, or stepping into a carriage. There may\r\nhave intervened a considerable period of time free from conscious effort\r\non the special question involved in the discovery. Poincaré is inclined\r\nto account for these sudden solutions of theoretical difficulties on the\r\nassumption of long periods of previous unconscious work.\r\n\r\nThere are many such records from men of genius. At the moment the\r\ninventor obtains the solution of his problem his mind may seem to be\r\nleast engaged with it. The long-sought-for idea comes like an\r\ninspiration, something freely imparted rather than voluntarily acquired.\r\nNo mental process is more worthy to command respect; but it may not lie\r\nbeyond the possibility of explanation. Like ethical insight, or\r\nspiritual illumination, the scientific idea comes to those who have\r\nstriven for it. The door may open after we have ceased to knock, or the\r\nresponse come when we have forgotten that we sent in a call; but the\r\ndiscovery comes only after conscious work. The whole history of science\r\nshows that it is to the worker that the inspiration comes, and that new\r\nideas develop from old ideas.\r\n\r\nIt may detract still further from the mysteriousness of the\r\ndiscovery-process to add that the illuminating idea may come in the\r\nmidst of conscious work, and that then also it may appear as a sudden\r\ngift rather than the legitimate outcome of mental effort. The\r\nspontaneity of wit may afford another clue to the mystery of scientific\r\ndiscovery. The utterer of a witticism is frequently as much surprised by\r\nit as the auditors, probably because the idea comes as verbal imagery,\r\nand the full realization of their significance is grasped only with the\r\nactual utterance of the words. The fact that to the scientific\r\ndiscoverer the solution of his problem arrives at the moment when it is\r\nleast sought is analogous to the common experience that the effort to\r\nrecall a name may inhibit the natural association.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to emphasize unduly the rôle played by the scientific\r\nimagination springs probably from the misconception that the imagination\r\nis a psychological superfluity, one of the luxuries of the mental life,\r\nwhich should not be withheld from those who deserve the best. The view\r\nlingers with regard to the æsthetic imagination. James could not\r\nunderstand the biological function of the æsthetic faculty. On the\r\nalleged uselessness of this phase of the human mind A. J. Balfour has\r\nrecently based an argument for the immortality of the soul. This view is\r\nstrikingly at variance with that which inclines to identify it with that\r\nmental process which creates scientific theories and thus paves the way\r\nfor the adjustment of posterity to earthly conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Baldwin, J.

Pedagogy,\r\ntherefore, is based partly on psychology--which, as we have seen in the\r\npreceding chapter, is closely related to the biological sciences--and\r\npartly on ethics, or the study of morals, closely related to the social\r\nsciences. These two aspects of education, the psychological and the\r\nsociological, were treated respectively in Rousseau's _Emile_ and\r\nPlato's _Republic_. The former ill-understood work, definitely referring\r\nits readers to the latter for the social aspect of education, applies\r\nitself as exclusively as possible to the study of the physical and\r\nmental development of the individual child. Rousseau consciously set\r\naside the problem of nationality or citizenship; he was cosmopolitan,\r\nand explicitly renounced the idea of planning the education of a\r\nFrenchman or a Swiss. Neither did he desire to set forth the education\r\nof a wild man, free and unrestrained. He wished rather to depict the\r\ndevelopment of a natural man in a state of society; but he emphasized\r\nthe native hereditary endowment, while expressing his admiration for\r\nPlato's _Republic_ as the great classic of social pedagogy. The titles\r\nof the two works, one from the name of an individual child, the other\r\nfrom a form of government, should serve to remind us of the purpose and\r\nlimitations of each.\r\n\r\nPlato's thought was centered on the educational and moral needs of the\r\ncity-state of Athens. He was apprehensive that the city was becoming\r\ncorrupted through the wantonness and lack of principle of the Athenian\r\nyouth. He strove to rebuild on reasoned foundations the sense of social\r\nobligation and responsibility which had in the earlier days of Athens\r\nrested upon faith in the existence of the gods. As a conservative he\r\nhoped to restore the ancient Athenian feeling for duty and moral worth,\r\nand he even envied some of the educational practices of the rival\r\ncity-state Sparta, by which the citizen was subordinated to the state.\r\nThe novel feature of Plato's pedagogy was the plan to educate the\r\ndirecting classes, men disciplined in his own philosophical and ethical\r\nconceptions. He was, in fact, an intellectual aristocrat, and spoke of\r\ndemocracy in very ironical terms, as the following sentences will\r\nshow:--\r\n\r\n\"And thus democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their\r\nopponents.... And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a\r\ngovernment have they? For as the government is, such will be the man....\r\nIn the first place, are they not free? and the city is full of freedom\r\nand frankness--a man may do as he likes.... And where freedom is, the\r\nindividual is clearly able to order his own life as he pleases?... Then\r\nin this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human\r\nnatures?... This then will be the fairest of States, and will appear the\r\nfairest, being spangled with the manners and characters of mankind, like\r\nan embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower. And\r\njust as women and children think variety charming, so there are many\r\nmen who will deem this to be the fairest of States.... And is not the\r\nequanimity of the condemned often charming? Under such a government\r\nthere are men who, when they have been sentenced to death or exile, stay\r\nwhere they are and walk about the world; the gentleman [convict] parades\r\nlike a hero, as though nobody saw or cared.... See too ... the forgiving\r\nspirit of democracy and the 'don't care' about trifles, and the\r\ndisregard of all the fine principles which we solemnly affirmed ... how\r\ngrandly does she trample our words under her feet, never giving a\r\nthought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and promoting to honor\r\nanyone who professes to be the people's friend.... These and other\r\nkindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which is a charming\r\nform of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing\r\nequality to equals and unequals alike.... Consider now ... what manner\r\nof man the individual is ... he lives through the day indulging the\r\nappetite of the hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of\r\nthe flute; then he is for total abstinence, and tries to get thin; then,\r\nagain, he is at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything,\r\nthen once more living the life of a philosopher; often he is in\r\npolitics, and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into\r\nhis head; and, if he is emulous of anyone who is a warrior, off he is in\r\nthat direction, or of men of business, once more in that. His life has\r\nneither order nor law; so he goes on continually, and he terms this joy\r\nand freedom and happiness. Yes, his life is all liberty and equality.\r\nYes, ... and multiform, and full of the most various characters; ... he\r\nanswers to the State, which we described as fair and spangled.... Let\r\nhim then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called the\r\ndemocratic man.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the satirical tone of this passage much of it may be\r\naccepted as the unwilling tribute of a hostile critic. Democracy is the\r\ntriumph of the masses over the oligarchs. It is merciful in the\r\nadministration of justice. It shows a magnanimous spirit and does not\r\nmagnify the importance of trifles. It prefers the rule of its friends to\r\nthe rule of a despot. Under its government people feel themselves\r\nblessed by happiness, liberty, and equality. The culture of the\r\ndemocratic man is above all characterized by adaptability.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth century Matthew Arnold, the apostle of culture,\r\ndiscussing the civilization of a democratic nation of many millions,\r\nunconsciously confirmed the views of Plato in some respects, while\r\nshowing interesting points of difference. He expressed his admiration of\r\nthe institutions, solid social conditions, freedom and equality, power,\r\nenergy, and wealth of the people of the United States. In the daintiness\r\nof American house-architecture, and in the natural manners of the free\r\nand happy American women he saw a real note of civilization. He felt\r\nthat his own country had a good deal to learn from America, though he\r\ndid not close his eyes to the real dangers to which all democratic\r\nnations are exposed. Arnold failed in his analysis of American\r\ncivilization to confirm Plato's judgment concerning the variety of\r\nnatures to be found in the democratic State, as well as the Greek\r\nphilosopher's censure that democracy shows disregard of ethical\r\nprinciples. In fact, Arnold considered the people of the United States\r\nsingularly homogeneous, singularly free from the distinctions of class;\r\n\"we [the English] are so little homogeneous, we are living with a system\r\nof classes so intense, that the whole action of our minds is hampered\r\nand falsened by it; we are in consequence wanting in lucidity, we do not\r\nsee clear or think straight, and the Americans have here much the\r\nadvantage of us.\" As for the second point of difference between Arnold\r\nand Plato, the English critic recognized that the American people\r\nbelonged to the great class in society in which the sense of conduct and\r\nregard for ethical principles are particularly developed.\r\n\r\nNearly all the old charges against American democracy can be\r\nsummarized in one general censure,--the lack of calm and reasoned\r\nself-criticism,--and this general defect is rapidly being made good. It\r\nis partly owing to charity and good-will, and it includes the toleration\r\nof the mediocre or inferior, as, for example, in the theater; the\r\nfailure to recognize distinction, and to pay deference to things\r\ndeserving it; the glorification of the average man, and the _hustler_,\r\nand the lack of special educational opportunities for the exceptionally\r\ngifted child. That criticism as an art is still somewhat behindhand in\r\nAmerica seems to be confirmed by comparing French and American literary\r\ncriticism. In France it is a profession practiced by a corps of experts;\r\nin America only a very few of the best periodicals can be relied on to\r\ngive reviews based on critical principles, of works in verse or prose.\r\n(One American reviewer confesses that in a single day he has written\r\nnotices of twenty new works of fiction, his work bringing him, as\r\nremuneration, seventy-five cents a volume.)\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence, however, that Americans as individuals are wanting\r\nin the self-critical spirit. And for Arnold this is vital, seeing that\r\nthe watchword of the culture he proclaims is Know Thyself. It is not a\r\nquestion of gaining a social advantage by a smattering of foreign\r\nlanguages. It is more than intellectual curiosity. \"Culture is more\r\nproperly described as having its origin in the love of perfection. It\r\nmoves by the force, not merely or primarily of the scientific passion\r\nfor pure knowledge, but also of the passion for doing good.\" Human\r\nperfection, the essence of culture, is an internal condition, but the\r\nwill to do good must be guided by the knowledge of what is good to do;\r\n\"acting and instituting are of little use unless we know how and what we\r\nought to act and institute.\" Moreover, \"because men are all members of\r\none great whole, and the sympathy which is human nature will not allow\r\none member to be indifferent to the rest, the expansion of our humanity,\r\nto suit the idea of perfection which culture forms, must be a _general_\r\nexpansion.\"\r\n\r\nFor Arnold's contemporary Nietzsche, the German exponent of Aristocracy,\r\nthe _expansion_ of education entailed its diminution. For him ancient\r\nGreece was the only home of culture, and such culture was not for all\r\ncomers. The rights of genius are not to be democratized; not the\r\neducation of the masses, but rather the education of a few picked men\r\nmust be the aim. The one purpose which education should most zealously\r\nstrive to achieve is the suppression of all ridiculous claims to\r\nindependent judgment, and the inculcation upon young men of obedience to\r\nthe scepter of genius. The scientific man and the cultured man belong to\r\ntwo different spheres which, though coming together at times in the same\r\nindividual, are never fully reconciled.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the full perverseness, from the democratic\r\nstandpoint, of Nietzsche's view of culture, it is necessary to glance\r\nat his political ideals as explained by one of his sponsors.\r\nNietzsche repudiates the usual conception of morality, which he calls\r\nslave-morality, in favor of a morality of masters. The former according\r\nto him encourages the deterioration of humanity; the latter promotes\r\nadvancement. He favors a true aristocracy as the best means of producing\r\na race of supermen. \"Instead of advocating 'equal and inalienable rights\r\nto life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,' for which there is at\r\npresent such an outcry (a régime which necessarily elevates fools and\r\nknaves, and lowers the honest and intelligent), Nietzsche advocates\r\nsimple _justice_--to individuals and families according to their\r\n_merits_, according to their worth to society; _not_ equal rights,\r\ntherefore, but unequal rights, and inequality in advantages generally,\r\napproximately proportionate to deserts; consequently, therefore, a\r\ngenuinely superior ruling class at one end of the social scale, and an\r\nactually inferior ruled class, with slaves at its basis, at the opposite\r\nsocial extreme.\"\r\n\r\nSince it is the view of this aristocratic philosopher that science is\r\nthe ally of democracy--a view that every chapter of the history of\r\nscience serves to demonstrate--it is of interest to review his opinion\r\nof the character of the scientist. For Nietzsche the scientist is not a\r\nheroic superman, but a commonplace type of man, with commonplace\r\nvirtues. He lacks domination, authority, self-sufficiency; he is rather\r\nin need of recognition from others and is characterized by the\r\nself-distrust innate in all dependent men and gregarious animals. He is\r\nindustrious, patiently adaptable to rank and file, equable and moderate\r\nin capacity and requirement. He has a natural feeling for people like\r\nhimself, and for that which they require: A fair competence and the\r\ngreen meadow without which there is no rest from labor. The scientist\r\nshows no rapture for exalted views; in fact, with an instinct for\r\nmediocrity, he is envious and strives for the destruction of the\r\nexceptional man.\r\n\r\nA training in natural science tends to make one objective. But the\r\nobjective man, in Nietzsche's opinion, distrusts his own personality and\r\nregards it as something to be set aside as accidental, and a detriment\r\nto calm judgment. The temperamental philosopher thinks the scientist\r\nserene, but that his serenity springs not from lack of trouble, but from\r\nincapacity to grasp and deal with his own private grief. His is merely\r\ndisinterested knowledge, according to Nietzsche. The scientist is\r\nemotionally impoverished. His love is constrained, and his hatred\r\nartificial; he is less interesting to women than the warrior. \"His\r\nmirroring and externally self-polished soul no longer knows how to\r\naffirm, no longer how to deny; he does not command; neither does he\r\ndestroy.\" As we see in the case of Leibnitz, the scientist contemns\r\nscarcely anything (_Je ne méprise presque rien_). The scientist is an\r\ninstrument, but not a goal; he is something of a slave, nothing in\r\nhimself--_presque rien!_ There is in the scientist nothing bold,\r\npowerful, self-centered, that wants to be master. He is for the most\r\npart a man without content and definite outline, a selfless man.\r\n\r\nThis educational product, which the builders of modern aristocracy\r\nreject, and describe after their fashion, we accept as the ally of the\r\nmasses of the people, and we term it democratic culture.\r\n\r\nThe objective man, at the same time, may find even in the vehement pages\r\nof Nietzsche warnings and criticisms which the friends of democracy\r\nshould not disregard. Extreme, almost insane, as his doctrine\r\nundoubtedly is, it may have value as a corrective influence, an antidote\r\nfor other extreme views. It serves to remind us that democracy may be\r\nmisled by feelings in themselves noble, and may, by grasping what seems\r\ngood, miss what is best. For example, there are in the United States\r\nabout three hundred thousand persons, defective or subnormal mentally;\r\nthere is a smaller number of persons exceptionally gifted mentally. It\r\nis a poor form of social service that would exhaust the resources of\r\nscience and philanthropy to care for the former without making any\r\nspecial provision for the latter. Genius is too great an asset to be\r\nwasted or misapplied. All culture would have suffered if Newton had been\r\nheld, in his early life, to exacting administrative work; or if Darwin\r\nhad devoted his years to alleviating the conditions of the miners of\r\nPeru whose misery touched him so profoundly; or if Pasteur had been\r\ntaken from the laboratory and pure science to make a country doctor. Nor\r\ncan democracy rest satisfied with any substitute for culture which would\r\ndisregard what is great in literature, in art, and in philosophy, or\r\nwhich would ignore history, and the languages and civilizations of the\r\npast, as if culture had its beginning yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we have considered democracy and democratic culture from\r\nthe standpoint of three writers on education, a Greek aristocrat, a\r\nGerman advocate of the domination of the classes over the masses, and an\r\nOxford professor, all by training and temperament more or less hostile\r\ncritics. A more direct procedure might have been employed to establish\r\nthe claim of science to afford a basis of intellectual and social\r\nhomogeneity. A brilliant literary man of the present day considers that\r\nplaces in the first ranks of literature are reserved for the doctrinally\r\nheterodox. None of the great writers of Europe, he asserts, have been\r\nthe adherents of the traditional faith. (He makes an exception in favor\r\nof Racine: but this is a needless concession, for Racine owed his early\r\neducation to the Port Royalists, became alienated from them and wrote\r\nunder the inspiration of the idea of the moral sufficiency of worldly\r\nhonor; then, after an experience that shook his faith in his own code,\r\nhe returned to the early religious influences in his life and composed\r\nhis _Esther_ and _Athalie_.) But, unlike literature, the study of\r\nscience is not exclusive. In the front ranks of science stand the devout\r\nRoman Catholic Pasteur, the Anglican Darwin, the Unitarian Priestley,\r\nthe Calvinist Faraday, the Quakers Dalton, Young, and Lister, Huxley\r\nthe Agnostic, and Aristotle the pagan biologist. Science has no Test\r\nActs.\r\n\r\nThat the cultivation of the sciences tends to promote a type of culture\r\nthat is democratic rather than aristocratic, sympathetic rather than\r\naustere, inclusive rather than exclusive, is further witnessed by the\r\nfact that the tradesman and artisan, as well as the dissenter, play a\r\nlarge part in their development. We have seen that Pasteur was the son\r\nof a tanner, Priestley of a cloth-maker, Dalton of a weaver, Lambert of\r\na tailor, Kant of a saddler, Watt of a shipbuilder, Smith of a farmer.\r\nJohn Ray was, like Faraday, the son of a blacksmith. Joule was a brewer.\r\nDavy, Scheele, Dumas, Balard, Liebig, Wöhler, and a number of other\r\ndistinguished chemists, were apothecaries' apprentices. Franklin was a\r\nprinter. At the same time other ranks of society are represented in the\r\nhistory of science by Boyle, Cavendish, Lavoisier. The physicians and\r\nthe sons of physicians have borne a particularly honorable part in the\r\nadvancement of physical as well as mental science. The instinctive\r\ncraving for power, the will to dominate, of which Nietzsche was the\r\nlyricist, was in these men subdued to patience, industry, and\r\nphilanthropy. The beneficent effect of their activities on the health\r\nand general welfare of the masses of the people bears witness to the\r\nsanity and worth of the culture that prompted these activities.\r\n\r\nAs was stated at the outset of this chapter, education is the oversight\r\nand guidance of the development of the immature with certain ethical and\r\nsocial ends in view. The material of instruction, the method of\r\ninstruction, and the type of educational institution, will vary with\r\nthe hereditary endowment, age, and probable social destiny of the child.\r\nIn a democratic country likely to become more, rather than less,\r\ndemocratic, those subjects will naturally be taught which have vital\r\nconnection with the people's welfare and progress in civilization. At\r\nthe same time the method of instruction will be less dogmatic and more\r\ninclined (under a free than under an absolute government) to evoke the\r\nchild's powers of individual judgment; arbitrary discipline must yield\r\ngradually to self-discipline. The changes here indicated as desirable\r\nare already well under way in America. As regards types of educational\r\ninstitution, it is significant that America about the middle of the\r\neighteenth century introduced the Miltonic, nonconformist Academy, with\r\nits science curriculum, in place of the traditional Latin grammar\r\nschool. Later the American high school, institutions of which type now\r\nhave over a million pupils, and teach science by the heuristic\r\nlaboratory method, became the popular form of secondary school. It is,\r\nlikewise, not without social significance that the Kindergarten was\r\nsuppressed in Prussia after the revolt of the people in the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century, and that it found a more congenial home in a\r\ndemocratic country. Its educational ideal of developing self-activity\r\nwithout losing sight of the need of social adaptation finds its\r\ncorollary in systematic teaching of the sciences in relation both to the\r\ndaily work and to their historical and cultural antecedents.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n Matthew Arnold, _Essays in Criticism_, and _Culture and Anarchy_.\r\n\r\n Matthew Arnold, _Civilization in the United States_.\r\n\r\n Friedrich Nietzsche, _On the Future of our Educational Institutions_,\r\n   vol.
